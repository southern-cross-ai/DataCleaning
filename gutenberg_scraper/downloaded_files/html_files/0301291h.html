<h1 align="center">Ralph Rashleigh</h1>

<h3 align="center">by<br>
James Tucker</h3>

<p align="center">Published 1952</p>

<p><i>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: Tucker wrote his autobiographical
&ldquo;Ralph Rashleigh; or, The Life of an Exile&rdquo; in 1844. It
was published in a heavily edited form in 1929, and his original
manuscript was published in 1952. Below is a copy of the letter
that caused him to be convicted of blackmail:</i>
</p>

<p class="note">Sir, &mdash; You perhaps did not expect to hear
from me so suddenly; but when you turned me away from Laytonstone
for a mere trifle, (that too at a time when by the late failures
many scores of clerks were out of employ,) you forgot that I had
you in my power through your transactions with me five nights
following, (I have the dates and circumstances on paper written at
the time,) and that from your conduct to me before I went to live
with you, you could expect no mercy from me.</p>

<p class="note">Did you not, however, let it pass? In a few words,
I have taken advice upon the subject, and know that if you are
obstinate, it is in my power to bring down ruin on your head, and
infamy on your name. However, I will be merciful. Allow me to
return to L. in the same manner as before, I will never mention it
again, as if I did I should lose every thing, and gain nothing; but
it is impossible for me to get any situation in town at present. It
is not true that Mrs. T. advertised, as you said; she is in great
distress, and she is my mother, therefore I would wish to afford
her a little relief, if possible; so send me five pounds to my
address; which, with the other you lent me, I will I. O. U. for,
and pay when I get a place. If I do not hear from you by Saturday
morning, you will hear of it (enclosing five pounds). Now consider
ruin and beggary on one side, and wealth and comfort on the other;
remember, that, if you are obstinate, it will cost you all; do as I
say, it will cost you nothing. I wait your answer before I proceed.
As yet I have given Mr. Norris no names. On Saturday night, (if you
are silent,) I will go too far to retract.</p>

<p class="note">Yours obediently.<br>
(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JAMES
TUCKER, Junior.</p>

<p>The tale contained in the following pages was compiled by the
Editor as it fell from the lips of the person who was at once the
author and in some sort the hero of the adventures therein
narrated, chiefly with a view to dissipate the ennui and vary the
monotony &mdash; at times inseparable, in the circumstances of a
life in the bush of Australia.</p>

<p>As, however, the truth of many of the leading incidents is known
to the Editor personally, and that of others has been vouched for
by persons of undoubted veracity, it is now offered to the public,
who, it is hoped, will receive it with the indulgence due to the
rude unadorned production of<br>

<p align="center" class="note"><b>Why Then The World&rsquo;s Mine
Oyster</b>
</p>

<p>Respecting the parents of Ralph Rashleigh, little needs here he
add save that they were of a decent rank as London shopkeepers, and
that they were thus enabled to afford their son the advantage of a
good plain English education, upon the completion of which he was
articled to a conveyancer in extensive practice, who resided near
Chancery Lane, a <i>romantic</i> neighbourhood to which Ralph was
compelled to restrict his rambles for the first two years of his
servitude; but on the expiration of that period, in compliance with
a stipulation contained in his indentures, a small allowance being
made to him, he ceased to reside under his master&rsquo;s roof and
occupied a lodging by himself.</p>

<p>He was now fairly launched upon the great ocean of Life, for
although his office hours were sufficiently long, yet abundance of
time still remained, during which Rashleigh was completely his own
master; and amid the varied amusements offered to his choice in the
modern Babylon, he soon found nothing deficient for enjoyment,
except money, with which he was but sparingly supplied. This
hiatus, of course, giving him much pain, he naturally set himself
to work to remove it, if possible, but for a long period without
any success.</p>

<p>Among the number of his boon companions was a young man, who
though only receiving from his employer an equal salary to himself,
yet always appeared to be possessed of means for the gratification
of his pleasures; and as he ever seemed to distinguish Ralph with
his friendship, the latter, one evening when both were tolerably
warm from the effect of numerous potations in which they had
indulged, begged his friend to explain how he managed so well with
his limited income, as always to have cash for any expense he chose
to incur.</p>

<p>His companion, whose name was Hartop, after many injunctions of
secrecy, informed him that as his employer usually sent him to make
payments and receive money upon account of the business, he had for
a long period been in the habit of occasionally passing bad
sovereigns, using however great precaution. and never carrying more
than <i>one</i> at a time upon his person. Then he picked his
customers &mdash; mostly people from the country or residing at a
distant part of London &mdash; to whom he would tender a <i>queer
piece</i> and if it were objected to, would immediately replace it
by a good one, wondering how he came by it, etc. At other times,
when he thought he could do so safely in telling over money he was
about to receive, he would dexterously exchange one of the good
ones for another he had previously concealed in his hand, which of
course was bad. The result of this manoeuvre would be, that when he
objected to the one he had himself put down, the person about to
pay him, probably knowing all the pieces he had tendered to be
genuine, would exchange the one questioned without hesitation. Nay,
so good were the imitations he made use of, that often, in paying
considerable sums of money in gold into banks &mdash; where the
specie was weighed in the lump &mdash; a bad sovereign would pass
current enough among many others, and not excite any suspicion.</p>

<p>This communication over, Hartop offered our hero his services,
to procure him a few of the <i>inimitable imitations</i> of the
current coin of the realm, adding that he could pay for them when
he was <i>lucky</i>. To this offer Ralph, nothing loath, assented.
A few days after, he received from his <i>friend</i> twenty
spurious sovereigns, that being deemed enough for his first
essay.</p>

<p>Thus did Ralph Rashleigh commence his career of dishonesty, and
for a long period escaped with impunity, owing to the able manner
in which he adopted and followed the cautious counsels of his sage
tutor. At length, finding that he could obtain all the luxuries of
life, not to mention necessaries only, without any very arduous
exertion, he became so very idle, careless, and inattentive to his
employer&rsquo;s business, that after many fruitless remonstrances
and unavailing lectures from his worthy principal, he received lib
dismissal, his articles being cancelled.</p>

<p>This event, indeed, did not much concern him, as he believed he
should always be able to supply his wants by means of passing bad
money. as heretofore. In order, however, to lull suspicion, which
might have been awakened had he remained without any employment or
apparent means of earning a livelihood whatever, Ralph, who now
wrote a remarkably fine and quick legal hand, obtained out-of-door
copying from a law scrivener, intending to do only just as much
work as might be supposed to afford him subsistence.</p>

<p>After this resolution, his custom was to work two or three hours
per day at his lodging, and to employ the rest of his time
perambulating London, varying his rambles every day, and at times
shifting the scene of his exertions to a fair or race in the
country, where he generally met with tolerable success.</p>

<p>But the period of his profitable trading in this line was
rapidly drawing to a close, and one unlucky day, having extended
his operations to Maidstone at the time of a fair, he was
apprehended. As, contrary to his usual custom, he had then
<i>two</i> bad sovereigns in his pocket, he was committed to take
his trial upon a charge of uttering counterfeit coin. At the
ensuing assizes in spite of a most ingenious defence, he was found
guilty and sentenced to pass twelve months in imprisonment at hard
labour in the house of correction.</p>

<p>This being prior to the invention of treadmills or the
improvement of prison discipline, there was no restraint to free
communication with his fellow <i>unfortunates</i>. And the species
of employment, which consisted only of picking oakum and beating
hemp, afforded ample opportunities for the relation by his
companions of the many marvellous exploits, cunning schemes,
hair-breadth scapes, and successful stratagem for which the lives
of each had been remarkable.</p>

<p>It may very easily he imagined, that such society produced its
full effect upon the mind of our adventurer, who had, in fact,
never been notorious for any great nicety in distinguishing the
difference between <i>meum et tuum</i>, and he now emerged from his
confinement a most finished adept in all those arts by winch the
unprincipled portion of mankind contrived, five and twenty years
ago, to victimise their unwary fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>Ardently longing to reduce the <i>praiseworthy</i> theoretical
knowledge he had thus acquired to practical purposes, Rashleigh
returned from the gaol to London, in which he still possessed some
good clothing and a few trinkets. The latter he now turned into
cash for his present subsistence, and then proceeded to the town of
Winchester, where he had been informed by an old <i>cracksman</i>
(housebreaker)&mdash; whom he had left in durance at Maidstone
&mdash; there was a jeweller&rsquo;s shop from which a large booty
might easily he acquired. In fact, before he was released, Ralph
had concerted a plan of operations with his informant, to be put in
practice for this purpose when the latter should have served his
full sentence and again acquired his liberty.</p>

<p>But our hero had no intention of waiting for an associate, as he
wisely deemed the spoil would suffer much by participation with
another. Therefore, the very day after that on which he had
returned to the metropolis, he set off for Winchester per coach,
provided with THe necessary implements of every kind for his
nefarious purpose, carefully put up, with a change of clothing, in
a carpet bag.</p>

<p>Having duly arrived at the proposed scene of action, he
adjourned from the coach office to a small public-house on the
outside of the town, where he dined. He then proceeded to view the
shop in question. Everything here was apparently as he had been
informed, and having spent a few minutes inside the shop,
ostensibly for the purpose of purchasing a trifling article, he
returned to his inn, there to digest his plans at leisure. These
were soon arranged, and Rashleigh, having taken his supper,
discharged his reckoning and went to bed, requesting that he might
be called at two o&rsquo;clock, there being a coach to start for
Portsmouth at that hour.</p>

<p>The morning proved as dark as Erebus, for it was in the month of
November. A chill sleet had completely driven the ancient guardians
of the night to their retreats, and not a single sound disturbed
the tranquillity of the town. Ralph therefore met with no
difficulty or obstacle in his route to the shop. Once there, to
remove a panel of the shutter with his centre-bit and chisel was an
easy task. The glass next presented itself. This was also cut
through with a diamond and prevented from falling by means of a
piece of putty held against it. There was a small brass wire
grating next the window; but it was movable, and the robber had
nothing to prevent him from filling his pockets with the various
articles which he could feel lay in the cases before him; when lo,
the lusty shout of a watchman at a distance, crying the hour,
warned him to be cautious. Accordingly he clapped a piece of
dark-coloured paper against the opening of the panel and hastily
betook himself to the kind concealment afforded by the shadows of
an antique porch hard by.</p>

<p>The <i>vigilant</i> conservator of public property quickly
passed, apparently in great haste to return to his box or the
comforts of the watch-house fire, and the coast being thus once
more clear, Ralph repaired to his unhallowed occupation. To fill
his bag, pockets and hat with valuables and all kind of trinkets
was but the work of a few minutes. Then, replacing the paper before
named, to prevent too early an outcry, he made the best of his way
by unfrequented paths to the outskirts of Winchester, where he had
during the afternoon noticed a wood, in which he now carefully
concealed all his ill-gotten booty, near the foot of an old and
remarkable tree. He then cut across the fields until he reached a
by-road leading to the town of Basingstoke. He walked upon this
road until morning dawned, having for the last few hours had the
benefit of the moon&rsquo;s friendly beams, which so much assisted
his progress that at daylight he found himself four and twenty
miles from Winchester, and near a small public-house by the
wayside. Here he stopped to refresh, and in a short time, a coach
coming by, he embraced the opportunity of obtaining a ride to
Farnham, where he intended to stay a day or two.</p>

<p>In the evening, weary of the solitude of his own apartment in
the public house where he put up, Ralph descended to the large
room, which served the inn &ldquo;for parlour, for kitchen and
hall&rdquo;, in which he found the assembled rustics gaping around
a man who had just arrived from Winchester, and who was giving them
the details of a most <i>owdacious</i> robbery which had there been
done the night before, property to the value of &pound;1,500 having
been abstracted from a jeweller&rsquo;s shop. The whole town and
neighbourhood were in a complete ferment at this very palpable
proof of the presence of some dexterous thieves, of whom it was
supposed a whole gang must have been employed to effect this
atrocious act. And all whom the sapient magistrates of Winchester
thought fit to consider loose or idle characters among the lower
classes of the townsfolk had them apprehended and examined. Such a
turmoil of arresting, searching, questioning, and cross-questioning
had never been known in Hampshire since the death of William Rufus.
Moreover, as a finale, to prove they <i>did</i> something as well
as talk so much. after all this uproar, two poor sailors who were
begging their way to Portsmouth in the hope of getting a ship were
apprehended and each sent six months to hard labour in gaol,
because they could give no better account of themselves than their
true history.</p>

<p>It may easily he credited that Rashleigh was no indifferent
auditor of this tale. He was, in sooth, much overjoyed to find that
the police of Winchester were so far astray in their suspicions,
and he consequently resolved to pay a visit to some relatives he
possessed at Southampton for a few days, after which he proposed to
return for his spoil, to the place of its concealment.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next day he put this determination into
practice. His friends at that pretty little sea-port received him
most cordially, the rather, no doubt, that they had not the
slightest idea of the manner in which he had lately spent his time,
but believed him to be still employed as a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk in
London, and that he had now come down to keep a holiday. A few days
were therefore passed most agreeably among them; but as the weather
was too inclement to permit much out-of-door exercise, the sameness
of the scene began to pall upon the mind of our adventurer, who
soon longed for a return to the more varied pleasures of the great
Babel. While here, however, a singular and rather romantic
adventure happened to Rashleigh, which will be found narrated in
the next chapter.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2" id="Chapter2"></a>Chapter
2</b>
</h2>

<p class="note">Thro&rsquo; the haze of the night, a bright flash
now appearing;<br>
&ldquo;Oh ho!&rdquo; cries bold Will, &ldquo;The Philistines bear
down;<br>
&ldquo;Never mind, my tight lads, never think about sheering;<br>
&ldquo;One broadside we&rsquo;ll give, should we swim, boys, or
drown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Rashleigh had embraced the opportunity of a somewhat dry
day, to walk out as far as the ruins of Netley Abbey, a venerable
monastic pile in the New Forest, and spent so long a period in
musing over the traces of fallen grandeur which it so abundantly
presents, that evening was rapidly closing before he became aware
of it. When he intended to retrace his steps to the town, he missed
his way and became quite bewildered among the ruins and in the
forest. At length, however, having hit upon a well-beaten path
which seemed to lead in the wished-for direction, he hastily turned
into it, and having proceeded for some distance, at length
discovered to his dismay that it only led to the banks of
Southampton Water, among an incongruous mass of ruins and rocks,
which covered the beach in picturesque but not &mdash; by him at
least &mdash; much admired profusion. It was now quite dark, and
our wanderer had the not very pleasing prospect before him of
passing the night in a solitary ramble along the winding recesses
of this famed harbour, when at a short distance he saw a light,
towards which, of course, he quickly bent his steps. He had
scarcely set out when he recollected that these ruins were said to
be the resort of deer stealers, smugglers and other outlaws, to
intrude upon whose privacy might be dangerous. This induced him to
proceed more cautiously and to reconnoitre the vicinity carefully.
But now the light had disappeared and Ralph was puzzling himself to
account for this, when it suddenly became again visible. Once more
all was dark and again the deceitful gleam was shown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it be a will o&rsquo; the wisp, or other <i>ignis
fatuus</i>?&rdquo; thought our adventurer, half resolved to abandon
the chase, when a voice, apparently near, but below him &mdash; as
it sounded as if emanating from some man at the bottom of a well
&mdash; hailed loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob! Bob! Is all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately, to Ralph&rsquo;s great dismay, the light he had
pursued so long in vain was now shown close to him in the hands of
a rough-looking sailor, whose truculent features bespoke intimate
acquaintance with the display of fire-arms he ostentatiously bore
in his belt. Half frightened to death at his very look, Rashleigh
suddenly sank down among the long grass and rubbish, scarcely
daring to breathe for fear of discovery.</p>

<p>The voice from beneath now asked, &ldquo;Is Curtis in
sight?&rdquo; as it seemed, while the person to whom it belonged
was ascending.</p>

<p>The man with the light replied, gruffly enough, &ldquo;No, he
an&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon after, both men appeared, to join each other at a very
short distance from Ralph, who lay <i>perdu</i>.</p>

<p>One now remarked that &ldquo;it was d &mdash;&mdash; d
strange&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The other, assenting, said &ldquo;it could not be for fear of
the hawks, for they were all off the Wight, on the look-out for
Jack Simmons, who had sent a note to an old <i>pal</i> of his at
Cowes, purposely that it might fall into the hands of the
preventive men, in which he stated that he should <i>try it on</i>
that night at Blackgang or the Undercliff. Consequently, the cutter
from Southampton, another from Portsmouth, and all the spare
officers had been sent over to the island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed by their further conversation that all this was known
to the smugglers through one of the revenue men in their pay, and
that the whole affair had been prearranged, so as to leave the
coast clear for their operations at the spot where they then
were.</p>

<p>A few minutes more elapsed in silence, when one of the men
suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;By G&mdash;&mdash;! There she is! Now
for the signal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A long loud whistle was given, and almost instantly the
trampling of many horses, accompanied by the clatter of harness,
was heard all round Ralph&rsquo;s hiding-place. Presently the
splash of oars indicated the approach of a boat, and a scene of
great bustle ensued. This boat and two others were rapidly unladen,
their contents being transferred to the backs of the horses and to
two or three light waggons. which had also been brought down to the
shore.</p>

<p>Suddenly another whistle was heard at some distance. It was
repeated, while just around the spot occupied by our hero many
exclamations, such as &ldquo;Look out for the hawks!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Blast them, they&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; were spoken in low
and hurried voices, warning him that the revenue officers were at
hand and coming to attack the smugglers, one of whom seemed to act
as leader. and now directed that the loaded waggons and horses
should he driven off as quickly as possible, while himself and a
few others tried to keep back the officers for a while, until the
cargo should be in safety. The horses and waggons accordingly went
off at a gallop, the persons who drove them seeming so well
acquainted with the route that in spite of the many obstacles and
the extreme darkness of the night, they were quickly out of
hearing.</p>

<p>The remainder of the smugglers, in obedience to the order of
their Chief, had either lain down or sheltered themselves behind
masses of rock, when a strong party of the coast-guard appeared
advancing round a projecting point, many of them bearing links (or
torches) by the light of which the whole bay was partially
illuminated, and the lugger might he seen crowding all her canvas
to escape. But the officers, being unprovided with boats, and
supposing besides that the cargo had been already landed, confined
their attempts to the capture of the latter, leaving the lugger to
get off unmolested, except by a few useless shots fired at her from
the shore, more, it would seem, out of bravado than with any idea
of damaging her crew. Soon the foremost of the officers came into
contact with the concealed smugglers, and instantly the blaze of
twenty muskets streamed amid the gloom.</p>

<p>Two of the officers fell. The remainder hastily retreated, and a
consultation having taken place among their leaders, they appeared
to resolve upon trying to pass the flank of their opponents, and
they therefore turned inland; but very soon after again exposed
themselves to a most galling fire from the smugglers, who lay in
safety, secured by their position from the shot of the coast-guard
party, while the latter, through bearing torches and still
endeavouring to advance, suffered considerably.</p>

<p>Another pause ensued, when the leader of the King&rsquo;s men
cheering on his people, they fairly rushed in among the smugglers,
who, after discharging their guns at random, leaped up, and
endeavoured with the butt ends of their pieces to parry the
cutlasses which were aimed at them. All this rime poor Ralph lay in
a state of mortal fear, which was not much diminished when the fray
became most violent immediately around him, the leader of the
smugglers and the commander of the coast-guard having singled out
each other, and the bravest of their followers rushing to their
assistance. At last fresh and lively cheers from the wood, and loud
cries of &ldquo;Down with the blasted hawks!&rdquo; indicated that
more help had arrived to the party of smugglers, upon which some of
the King&rsquo;s men forcibly carried their officer away from the
scene of conflict; when they all retreated in good order along the
beach, still keeping their faces to the foe, and occasionally
firing at any whom they fancied they could distinguish plainly
enough for that purpose.</p>

<p>The smugglers, on their part, did not molest them or attempt any
pursuit, but busied themselves in searching for their dead or
wounded companions. A number of lanterns now speedily made their
appearance, and the bearer of one of them approached Rashleigh, who
lay breathless and counterfeiting death as well as he could.</p>

<p>Seeing by his dress that he did not belong to either of the
conflicting parties, the man exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, what have we
got here? I zay, jack, here&rsquo;s a gemman. Let&rsquo;s zee
whether he&rsquo;s got anything in his pockets!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack, a fierce-looking fellow with enormous whiskers, now came
up, and holding his lantern close to Ralph&rsquo;s face, said,
&ldquo;By the hokey, he an&rsquo;t dead. He&rsquo;s only shamming
&mdash; or else in a swound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice of their leader was now heard demanding &ldquo;why
they didn&rsquo;t come on, what they were doing there, and whether
they wanted to bring all the sojers in Southampton down upon
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this one of Ralph&rsquo;s captors replied &ldquo;that they
had found a man who pretended to be dead, and that they thought he
must be a spy, from his dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A spy, hey?&rdquo; replied the smuggler. &ldquo;Bring him
along. We&rsquo;ll put him from <i>pretending</i> death any more;
he shall swing from the Beaulieu Oak before the night&rsquo;s an
hour older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Ralph quite lost what scanty remains of self-possession he
had left, and begged his captors. in the most moving terms for
mercy, but in vain. They hurried him along half running, between
them, striking his legs against every projecting root or stone in
the way.</p>

<p>At length, after having proceeded two or three miles in this
manner, following the sound of their companions&rsquo; footsteps,
and guided sometimes by a whistle from the front, they reached an
open forest glade, in the centre of which was an enormous and aged
oak. At the foot of this tree stood three men, among them the
leader of the smugglers, whose voice Ralph had so often heard in
the roar of that night&rsquo;s conflict. He now asked the prisoner
who he was, to which Rashleigh could only reply, while his teeth
chattered with terror, that he was a stranger, who had come on a
visit to Southampton and had lost his way near Netley the previous
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A d &mdash;&mdash; d fine tale,&rdquo; replied the
smuggler. &ldquo;You are a blasted spy, and shall die a dog&rsquo;s
death. Here&rsquo;s a good strong rope. You, Bill! Count a hundred.
And Harry and Jack, be ready when he has done to strap this fine
shaver up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Ralph now went upon his knees to beg for pity, while he
alternately prayed and invoked the most direful imprecations upon
his head if he were a spy, or if he had not spoken the truth; to
which the only reply vouchsafed was that he might as well spare the
little breath he had left, for he would find there was no mistake
about them.</p>

<p>In the mean time Bill had counted 64 and Ralph offered all he
possessed if they would let him go; 65 &mdash; 66 &mdash; 67 were
calmly repeated, but no reply came from the smuggler; 68-69 sounded
in his cars, and driven to utter despair, while the leader was
preparing a noose on the fatal cord, Ralph shook himself suddenly
free from the grip of the two men who held him, and snatching a gun
which stood against the tree, dealt such a vigorous blow with the
stock of it on the chief&rsquo;s head that he at once laid him
sprawling on the earth and broke his weapon short off by the
breech, leaving only the barrel in his hand.</p>

<p>He then sprang off and ran with the speed of a hunted deer,
closely followed by one of the smugglers, who seemed to be armed
only with a stick. When they had run a considerable distance,
Rashleigh, finding his pursuer gained upon him, rapidly dodged
short round, hoping to strike him unawares. But his foot slipped,
and he fell to the ground. The smuggler seized the gun barrel, and
after dealing the prostrate runaway a blow or two, which he
intended for his head, but which were saved by his arm, he began
dragging the unlucky Ralph back to the tree, in spite of all his
struggles or his loud outcries for assistance, which served only to
procure him fresh blows. At length another of the men came to the
assistance of his fellow, and between them they soon hauled their
victim back to the spot they destined to end all his earthly
struggles.</p>

<p>The smuggler chief was now seated under the tree, and one of the
men was binding up his wounded head, which seemed to have been
bleeding profusely. He welcomed the party with a grim laugh,
saying, &ldquo;So ho, my shaver. You thought to have settled me,
but long Frank has got a harder head than you reckoned for. Now, my
boys, what are you gaping at? Chuck the end of the rope over that
bough. And put the noose round that bloody dog&rsquo;s neck.
We&rsquo;ll give him five minutes&rsquo; good choking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant the rope was adjusted, and the end having been
disposed as directed, three of the smugglers laid hold of the part
that hung over the bough to haul the sufferer off the ground.</p>

<p>Already the rope was drawn tight, when a loud voice close at
hand roared out, &ldquo;oh ho, you blasted thieves! We&rsquo;ve got
you at last, have we?&rdquo; And suiting the action to the word,
the three fellows who held the rope were seized by a number of
armed men so great that all resistance was out of the question. The
smuggler chief and the other man, who till that moment had
continued his grasp upon Ralph, had both disappeared. As for
Rashleigh, he fell to the ground and was soon surrounded by a
number of persons, who from their dress and appearance seemed to be
gamekeepers and their assistants.</p>

<p>This proved to be the case. While they had been in search of
some deer stealers, they had been attracted to this spot by the
outcries of our adventurer, whose life they had thus opportunely
saved. They listened to Ralph&rsquo;s tale with much astonishment
and many execrations upon their three prisoners, whom, as the
daylight was now at hand, they proposed to escort to Southampton
Gaol.</p>

<p>On their way thither, they were met by two decent-looking men
who took the head gamekeeper aside. After some conversation, Ralph
was called to join them, when he was asked whether he had any
objection to forgiving the smugglers if a sum of money were paid to
him in atonement for their offence. The gamekeeper, who probably
looked upon smuggling as a very venial crime, or at any rate as
being of much less enormity than that of deer stealing, raised not
the smallest difficulty at letting the prisoners go; while Ralph,
who hated all law and detested the idea of appearing before a
magistrate, considered besides &mdash; since the chief smuggler had
escaped, with his principal coadjutor &mdash; that neither of the
three men who were taken had been active in persecuting him. So our
adventurer agreed, if the sum Of &pound;20 were paid to him as a
<i>douceur</i>, and the rest of the party satisfied, why, he was
content to let the matter drop.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached a small ale-house in the purlieus
of the forest, the inmates of which being with some difficulty
aroused, the whole party went in at the invitation of the
ambassadors; and as some refreshment was much needed by all &mdash;
but by none more than Rashleigh &mdash; a smoking breakfast, though
somewhat of the earliest, was welcomed with great satisfaction.
After breakfast one of the strangers took our adventurer aside and
paid him &pound;10 in part of the sum agreed on, the landlord of
the house binding himself to produce the other ten the same
evening. Ralph now bade his adieux to the company, who were fast
getting all drunk together, left the inn, and returned to
Southampton.</p>

<p>His absence had created a great sensation, and innumerable were
the questions to which the disordered state of his dress gave rise
on his arrival at his relatives&rsquo; house. But he parried them
all by saying that he had lost his way and torn his clothes in a
thicket, mentioning a different part of the forest to that in which
he had actually been, so as to evade any apparent knowledge of the
past night&rsquo;s affray. After taking some repose, he went in the
evening and received the promised balance of the money agreed to be
paid. In a few days thereafter, taking farewell of his friends, he
went over to Portsmouth, where he sojourned a week.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3" id="Chapter3"></a>Chapter

</h2>

<p align="center" class="note">Hath not a Jew <i>&mdash;
eyes?</i></p>

<p>As three weeks had now elapsed since the robbery at Winchester,
and all talk of it had ceased, Ralph determined on <i>springing his
plant</i>, or, in plain terms, securing his booty. For this purpose
he provided himself at Portsmouth with a new travelling trunk,
which he conveyed per coach to his destination. On his arrival at
the latter place, his first care was to fix his abode at an inn
near his precious deposit, his next to see that all was right in
the coppice where it lay. Having satisfied himself in this
particular, he waited until evening, when, by means of two
different visits to the spot, he removed the whole of the articles,
without exciting any suspicion, to his present headquarters, which
he left next morning for London, where he arrived in due course
without accident.</p>

<p>His next care was to dispose of the various articles produced by
his enterprise. For this purpose he selected an accommodating
Israelite, whose fame had been very often spoken of in the gaol he
had left as a safe <i>fence</i>, and a perfect pattern for all
<i>cross coves</i>. A dingy marine store shop in a court leading to
the Minories was the domicile of this descendant of a chosen
people, and thither one evening Ralph bent his way. Our adventurer
expected to see in Mr Jacobs a withered and filthy old being,
similar in external appearance to those of his race who then
perambulated the metropolis as dealers in cast-off clothing. His
surprise, therefore, was great when, upon enquiring from a little
Jewess in the shop for the master of it, a man in the prime of
life, and of most respectable exterior, was shown to him. Having
been provided with a password, as a shibboleth of introduction,
known only to the initiated, he was not long before he spoke his
errand, and it was agreed that they should meet at
Rashleigh&rsquo;s lodgings the next forenoon in order to make their
bargain.</p>

<p>At the time appointed Mr J. made his <i>entree</i>. Ralph was
prepared with a list and specimens of what he had to sell, as he
did not deem it altogether prudent to acquaint his new associate
with too much at once, nor did he wish to let him know that all the
property was then in that house. After overlooking both list and
articles with a very businesslike air, Mr Jacobs said to Ralph.
&ldquo;Vell, how mosh do you vant for de lot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At a word, one thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine Gott! Are you mad? Vere you tink all dat money shall
come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Jacobs! You know you could easily find twenty
times as much money as that, and I am sure they are a very great
bargain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vill tell you vat it ish. Py mine vord, I never did
know de monish so shcarce in all de days of my life; and is
pesides, if I was to porrow so mosh, to puy all dis lot of
trinkets, ven de devil you tink I get all my monish pack again? Eh?
Can you tell me dat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Mr Jacobs, if money is really so scarce, you
can buy half of what&rsquo;s on the list, and I will look out for
another mark to take the rest. What will you give for the fair
half? You know, we can divide them into two heaps, and toss up for
first choice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine Gott! Vat a hurry to be in! Vell, let me see, let me
see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All dese bracelets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very poor,
very poor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all French .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all French and
Jarman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bad gold, bad gold .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sell

how mosh I vill give you. I vill give .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, I
<i>vill</i> give you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. free hundred pounds for de
fair half .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. de monish in your hand. So take it or
leave it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this he pulled out an immense roll of bank notes from
some cunningly contrived pocket beneath his arm, and rose at the
same time as if to go away if the other did not take his offer.</p>

<p>Ralph only replied, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too little. Say
&pound;350.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not I, py mine Gott! Shall I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. If you won&rsquo;t give any more than that we
can&rsquo;t deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew seized the knob of the door, partly opened it, then
returned close to Rashleigh, and said in a mysterious whisper,
&ldquo;I vill give &pound;640 for de whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph shook his head, and Mr Jacobs ran out of the room and
downstairs.</p>

<p>Our adventurer had arisen from his seat and gone to the window
in order to watch the Israelite, intending, if he actually left the
house, to follow him, when Mr Jacobs again returned, closed the
door after him, and said. &ldquo;Now I vill give you &pound;650 for
dem all, and upon my shoul, I don&rsquo;t expect to get a
<i>finif</i> (&pound;5 note) py de pargain. But I vant to send some
jewels to Hambro&rsquo;, and dese vill do as vell as
any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Ralph agreed to take &pound;660, which was forthwith
paid down by the buyer in Bank of England notes, after which he
departed with the portmanteau and jewellery.</p>

<p>For some rime after this Rashleigh led an idle dissipated life,
frequently appearing at the theatres, gaming-houses, etc., until
the slippery goddess took it into her head to desert him, and he
found himself nearly penniless. It now became necessary for him to
bestir himself.</p>

<p>Fortune happened to throw in his way an acquaintance, in the
person of a female who had formerly been a servant to his employer,
with whom he had had a liaison, which he now renewed. She at
present lived in the service of an elderly gentleman of great
wealth in Welbeck Street. Our adventurer procured by her means
admittance into this her master&rsquo;s house and thus enjoyed
ample opportunities of observing the locality of the butler&rsquo;s
pantry, where he learned the plate was kept.</p>

<p>In order to succeed in the plan he had formed for plundering the
place, however, it was necessary for him to procure an associate in
his enterprise; and he thought himself lucky that about this time
he accidentally met in the street one of his quondam companions at
Maidstone Gaol. This man was now very <i>seedy</i> in appearance.
Having only just been liberated, and being without a shilling, he
was ripe for anything that could tend to put money in his pocket.
With him, therefore, Ralph made his arrangements, and all being
duly prepared, a hackney coachman, who had frequently served
Ralph&rsquo;s associate before in similar transactions, was engaged
to be in waiting at a public-house near the scene of their intended
operations, so that he might be at hand to receive the booty.</p>

<p>The same night, about twelve o&rsquo;clock, Ralph and his
<i>pal</i> went to the spot, fully prepared for action with all the
usual implements of housebreaking. There was as usual a circular
iron plate let into the pavement, to admit of coals being shot into
the cellar beneath. This was lifted up, and Ralph, who was then but
very slender, got down without difficulty. The covering was then
replaced by his associate, who retired to some distance, while
Ralph, who was well provided with skeleton keys, speedily got out
of the cellar and through several doors into the butler&rsquo;s
pantry, where he found the plate, apparently packed up, as if for a
journey! He soon carried it all into the cellar. Nothing had as yet
occurred to alarm him; but just at this moment a small dog, who was
asleep in the area, awoke and came running towards him. Upon
smelling his legs, the dog only fawned upon him, because he had
been sprinkled with a liquor which never fails to neutralise the
opposition of the most ferocious dog.</p>

<p>Ralph now locked himself into the cellar, where he awaited most
impatiently the approach of his associate, who was to have returned
in half an hour with the coach; but more than two hours elapsed
before they came, during which our adventurer was a prey to the
fiercest pangs of uncertainty and apprehension. At length the
appointed signal was given and the coach stopped. The plate was
quickly transferred to it, and in a few minutes they were driving
rapidly towards Paddington, where a furnished room had been taken
by Ralph the day before. On arrival, they soon secured their booty,
paid the jarvey, and lay down to rest. The next day, being resolved
to lose no time, Ralph went to the house of a well known
<i>fence</i> in Saint Mary Axe, where everything was so very well
regulated and the system adopted so cunning, that it seemed to have
reached the very pitch of perfection, insomuch that the buyer never
saw the seller nor the seller the buyer, thus effectually
preventing any after chance of unpleasant recognition. There was a
box turning in a wall, so contrived that upon placing any article
you wished to dispose of within it and ringing a bell, the box
revolved. After the lapse of a few minutes it again turned, and in
lieu of the article left, a sum of money, being the price the
proprietor was willing to pay for it, made its appearance. If the
seller refused to take this he again rang the bell, when his
article was returned; but no second offer was ever made. It may
easily be conceived that this establishment must have met with
great support. In fact, it was the means of immense gain to its
proprietor, who thus fixed his own price for all that he bought.
But still, the thieves of London much approved of the principle, as
they were never seen by anyone while disposing of their ill-gotten
booty &mdash; thus removing at least one great cause for fear of
detection. It was therefore continually well supported; and so
cunningly did the owner contrive, that although his premises were
repeatedly searched upon the best-founded suspicions that there was
stolen property concealed therein, yet nothing was ever found to
warrant a conviction.</p>

<p>Once a police officer chased a thief who had stolen a silver
teapot from a gentleman&rsquo;s breakfast table and kept him in
full view until he arrived at the door of the house in question. In
ran the thief. In two minutes the officer was after him; but there
being two doors to the shop, nobody was there. The house was
searched from top to bottom, and nothing was found like a silver
teapot.</p>

<p>The fact was that next door to this place the owner&rsquo;s
brother had a concealed crucible, which was constantly kept in
operation, and which communicated also with the house in question.
In this every article bought that would melt was instantly thrown,
so that no matter how costly the workmanship, in a few minutes any
sized piece of plate was converted into what the <i>fence</i> used
jocularly to call his &ldquo;vite soop&rdquo;.</p>

<p>To this famed spot Rashleigh now repaired and soon ascertained
the price he could get for the plate. It was but 2s. 6d. per ounce;
yet this was pretty fair upon the <i>cross</i>, and the
confederates divided &pound;200 between them as the proceeds of
their night&rsquo;s spoil.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4" id="Chapter4"></a>Chapter

</h2>

<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;Steal!&rdquo; Pho! A fico for
the phrase &mdash;&ldquo;convey&rdquo; the wise it call.</p>

<p>Soon after this occurrence Ralph was walking in the city, when
chancing to go into Lombard Street, he observed that the common
sewer was open for the purpose of repairs being effected. Now, not
far away from this opening there was an opulent banking-house, and
Ralph had often heard that in the vaults beneath these city banks
considerable sums of gold and Bank of England notes were deposited,
and he thought of a plan by which he might perchance break into one
of the vaults. To gain as much information as he could with regard
to the position of the house he went into the bank, pretending to
enquire whether a certain country establishment had failed or not.
There were several people within, and Rashleigh had thus a chance
of strictly scrutinising the place. It seemed, from the narrowness
of the frontage, that there could be no spare room on this floor,
and he naturally conceived that the hoard of valuables must be
deposited below, as he had before heard.</p>

<p>This was on Thursday, and by Saturday night he had fixed on his
plan, in pursuance of which he told the peeple of the house where
he lodged that he was going a little way into the country that
evening, and should not probably return before Monday. He then
provided the usual implements: plenty of false keys, a strong
crow-bar, technically called a jemmy, an instrument used for
cleaning bricks, some spirits and a slight provision of bread and
meat. All these he stowed away in his carpet bag, which he carried
under a large boat cloak, and about eight o&rsquo;clock steered
towards the city. Here he waited in a coffee room until it was past
eleven, and then started for the scene of his proposed exploit. As
he had a long distance to walk, it was after midnight when he
reached Lombard Street, which, not being inhabited by any of the
working classes, was now quite deserted save by the watchman.</p>

<p>Just at this moment propitious fortune seemed to favour his
design, for it began to rain heavily, and Ralph met no person
whatever near the opening of the sewer. After hastily reconnoitring
to make sure, he got into the cavity and with some difficulty
reached the bottom. Keeping close to the side of the sewer, he
proceeded along it, groping his way and taking note, as he went, of
the branch drains, by which he relied on finding the house he
sought, as there was usually one of these openings to each
dwelling, leading into the main sewer. He had carefully counted the
houses, gratings, etc. from the bank to that part of the street
where the chasm was formed.</p>

<p>At length he pitched upon an orifice which he felt sure would
lead him to the scene of his proposed exploit, and having first
procured a light by means of phosphorus and a wax taper &mdash; of
which he had brought an ample supply &mdash; he crept along the
branch drain, sounding its sides at short intervals until he was
aware, through the hollow jar produced by the wall, that he must be
opposite one of the apartments in the basement of the bank.</p>

<p>He now stripped himself and went seriously to work, prizing out
first one brick and then another. Soon, from the closeness of the
drain, he was in a state of profuse perspiration; but he kept
steadily on, varying his position as well as he could, for he felt
almost cramped to death by the confined spot and constrained
posture in which he was working. Thus he had wrought for a long
period, while all around him was as still as if he had been a
thousand fathoms deep in the bowels of the earth, when at once a
confused crash astounded him with its noise and almost smothered
him with dust and broken mortar. After the lapse of a few seconds,
this having partially cleared away, he found that several yards of
the brick crown and sides of the drain had fallen in, so that his
egress was completely blocked up. This, however, gave him but
little uneasiness, as he felt sure that if he were only fortunate
enough, once to get in to the haven of his hopes, he would easily
find some way to get out. But shortly after this discovery he cast
his eyes above him, and found to his utter dismay that a large part
of the wall he was then undermining had become loose and was
apparently about to give way, threatening to overwhelm and crush
him to atoms. He recoiled from the sight in consternation, and
retreated beneath a sound part of the drain, which he had hardly
gained, before down came the portion of wall, carrying away a large
piece of the drain in its fall, some flying fragment of which
struck our adventurer on the head and stretched him senseless in
the bottom of the sewer.</p>

<p>How long he lay there, of course, he could not tell; but on
recovering, he fancied it must have been some time, for a
considerable quantity of water had accumulated in the drain, which
was before dry. This must have greatly assisted Ralph&rsquo;s
recovery by its coolness, for he was lying in it; and if the injury
he sustained had been more serious, it is very probable he might
have been suffocated.</p>

<p>As it was, having raised himself with some difficulty, he groped
about until he found the phosphorus bottle and his tapers, which he
had fortunately put on one side, out of the way of his operations.
Having procured a light. his next care was to look for his bag of
tools and refreshments, which had also escaped injury. A hearty
pull at the spirit flask revived him, and he soon after mustered up
courage to approach the scene of his late discomfiture, when he
found to his great joy that a considerable breach had been formed
in the wall of the house, through which he could discern an
apartment or cellar of some sort. He speedily enlarged the opening
and got in, taking care to remove all his implements at the same
time.</p>

<p>Upon searching this room, however, he quickly discovered that it
contained not the object of his ambition, and he therefore examined
the door, intending to try one of his skeleton keys. But alas,
there was a key in the lock, and from its peculiar make, it seemed
to bid defiance to his efforts at forcing it. At last he dislodged
the door from its position, tearing out frame and all from the
brickwork, when he found that the opening led into a dark passage,
in which were three other doors, either open or having keys left in
them; but nothing could be found to induce Rashleigh to suppose
this any portion of the bank premises, as the rooms contained
nothing but empty packing-cases, old hampers, broken bottles and
straw. The powerful odour of drugs that pervaded all these dens
convinced Ralph that he had commenced operations on the wrong side
of the drain, having in fact broken into the house above the bank,
next to which he now recollected there was a wholesale
druggist&rsquo;s warehouse; and it was clear he had entered the
latter.</p>

<p>Almost reduced to despair by this discovery, which rendered all
his previous toil and danger abortive, our adventurer was on the
point of abandoning his enterprise, as he perceived, on looking at
his watch, it yet wanted two hours of day and he thought he could
leave the sewer unobserved. But at last he determined to persevere,
chiefly induced by reflecting that this being Sunday, there was
little fear of any interruption, at any rate for some hours
further.</p>

<p>He then returned to the drain from whence he had come, and after
having again sounded the opposite side of it, fixed upon a place
for recommencing his labour. Rendered much wiser by experience than
at first, he now commenced by taking out a double row of bricks
above the scene of his intended operations. Therein he inserted
into the wall a strong piece of wood, after the manner of a lintel,
to support the brickwork above, while he made his opening below.
Again he toiled incessantly, until his hands were galled and
blistered to a most painful degree. Stimulated, however, by hope of
a golden reward, he suffered not his energy to relax until he had
pierced through this partition, when he found a more serious
obstacle presented itself. This wall, for the sake of either
security or dryness, had been lined with oak planking, which stood
perpendicularly against it, well secured to horizontal pieces of
timber built into the wall. After having in vain attempted to
dislodge a plank, no resource remained but the centre-bit and
keyhole saw, with which, after about an hour more of arduous toil,
Ralph succeeded in making a square opening large enough to admit
his whole person.</p>

<p>His joy was now boundless to find that he was at length in the
wished-for treasure cell, of which he had no doubt at the first
glance. There were several cases of copper and silver money lying
open before him, and some smaller cases, which still more attracted
the attention and excited the cupidity of the plunderer. To force
some of these was his first care. But the greater part of them
contained only blanks, to fill up as bank notes for different sums.
There was also one case of bill stamps. Ralph began to think his
toil would be but ill repaid after all, when a chest which stood by
itself in a corner attracted his attention. Antique in its
appearance, and secured by many a clasp and many a massy band,
besides three huge padlocks, it bade defiance to all his efforts,
until he remembered having heard in experienced thief in Maidstone
Gaol say that after trying every other means in vain to rob a
strong chest, he often found it might be easily broken open at the
bottom, if it could only be turned over, the reason being that if
there be any damp near it is sure to be drawn under an article of
this kind, which causes the wood with which it comes into contact
to decay much sooner than any other part.</p>

<p>Acting on this idea, Ralph capsized the box in question with
some difficulty and discovered that the bottom was in fact quite
rotten and presented no serious obstacle to the tools, with which
he effected his purpose. He then saw that the chest in question
contained many bags, which on examination he found with joy were
full of coined gold. There was also a small open case, in which
were many Bank of England notes. Here then at last was the fruit of
his labours, his suffering and his danger; and after having puzzled
himself for a little while which was the best booty, he determined
on taking as many sovereigns as he could well carry, and all the
Bank of England paper he saw. He then emptied his carpet bag of its
contents, replacing them by sovereigns and notes, until he judged
that he must have nearly ten thousand pounds&rsquo; worth. Next,
carefully removing all the implements he had brought with him, he
withdrew through the drain into the adjoining house, where he
resolved to conceal himself during the day, as it was now nearly
eight o&rsquo;clock. Choosing the most out-of-the-way nook on the
whole floor, he made himself up a comfortable bed of straw from the
empty hampers, which he then disposed around him in such a manner
that it would not be very easy to discover him, even in case of a
search. He then made a hearty meal, drank some spirits, and
resigned himself to sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was just getting dark and he began now to
consider the means of egress, as he did not like the idea of
removing the bricks and rubbish from the drain, which he knew must
be done before he could return by that path. He shortly found out a
grating in the corner of one of the druggist&rsquo;s cellar rooms,
which he doubted not communicated with the main common sewer that
he had come up, and upon his removing it, this proved to be the
case. He now collected every tool he had used and threw them into a
cesspit, reserving only the phosphorus box and a taper, for fear of
an accident.</p>

<p>All being now ready for his departure, he waited with anxiety
the hour of twelve, which he had fixed upon because before that
time there were many stragglers always in the streets; but after
that, especially on Sunday nights, the city was comparatively
quiet. At length the wished-for number of strokes tolled from a
neighbouring church clock, and Rashleigh cautiously commenced his
return. When within a few yards of the opening from the sewer into
the street, he put out the taper he had hitherto carried, and threw
it, together with the phosphorus box, into the deepest hole near
him. He now listened attentively, and hearing no sound of footsteps
or aught else, he clambered, without loss of time, into the street,
heartily rejoicing in his success so far.</p>

<p>The night was very dark. It was still raining and from the
sloppy state of the streets, appeared to have been doing so without
any intermission since the night before. Ralph had made his way to
the foot pavement when a watchman suddenly stepped frorn under a
door and stood before him. Though he was somewhat startled, Ralph
preserved his equanimity as well as he could, merely saying in his
blandest tone of voice, &ldquo;Good-night, watchman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, sir,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Do you
know, I thought you came up out of the middle of that big hole just
now.&rdquo; And he laughed heartily at the idea.</p>

<p>Ralph smiled in return, saying as he went on, &ldquo;I crossed
the street just by that opening, which perhaps deceived your
sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It being now too late to obtain a hackney coach in that
neighbourhood, Rashleigh made the best of his way to the riverside,
where he knew there was a house kept open all night for the
accommodation of persons arriving by late packet boats, into which
he gained admittance. Not being much inclined to sleep, he spent
the remainder of the morning in reading a book he found by chance
in his bedroom. Soon after daylight he went to a neighbouring
stairs, where he hired a boat for Lambeth. Here he breakfasted, and
took a hackney coach for his lodgings, at which it was his first
care to hide every portion of his spoil in various secret places he
had before contrived for this purpose. He then put on a new
sporting suit of clothes that he had provided for his country
excursions, which, consisting of a Jolliffe white hat with an
enormous brim, a bottle green Newmarket-cut coat, white cord
breeches and top boots, effected a most surprising change in his
personal appearance. In the next place, being very desirous to
ascertain the earliest intelligence respecting the steps likely to
be taken for his own discovery and apprehension as the perpetrator
of the late robbery, he now repaired to the White Horse Cellar Inn,
Piccadilly, carrying with him a valise and umbrella. Here he
ascended a coach just arrived from Bristol, which was going into
the city to the Swan With Two Necks, Lad Lane, intending to remain
there for a day or two, fishing for information which might tend to
guide him not only in the disposal of his booty, but as to what
part of the world he had better go to. Having arrived at the inn,
he gave his name out to be Mr Robert Rowland, from Bristol, and
shortly afterwards stepped out, taking an opportunity of passing by
the scene of his depredation, and went into a coffee-room hard by,
but did not hear a breath respecting the matter.</p>

<p>At last he returned to the Swan, where, as he was dining in the
travellers&rsquo; room, it was not long before he overheard a
conversation between two persons occupying the box next to himself,
relative to the robbery. One o these two seemed to have been near
the bank when the discovery was made, which did not take place
until after ten o&rsquo;clock that morning. It also appeared that
the civic police were quite at fault; the means by which the house
had been robbed by being broken into were plain enough, for the
instant that the cashier went into the strong vault he saw all was
in confusion, and a very slight search led to the discovery of the
opening into the sewer; but they knew not how to, account for all
the rubbish in the branch drain, nor could they at all conceive how
the robbers had escaped after executing their purpose. It was
agreed, however, by all, that several thieves must have been
concerned, as it appeared to them the labour performed was far
greater than the truth.</p>

<p>The only persons upon whom suspicion had as yet fallen were the
workmen employed in repairing the sewer, all of whom had been
directly taken into custody; but it seemed two of their number, who
had been at work with them on the Saturday previous, had not
returned that morning to their task; nor could they be traced by
any enquiry which had been made. Therefore very heavy suspicion
attached itself to them, and a high reward had been offered for
their apprehension. In the mean time placards had been largely
circulated, giving intimation of the robbery, publishing the
numbers of the notes stolen, and promising &pound;500 for the
detection of the guilty parties.</p>

<p>Rashleigh devoured all this story with great avidity and felt
very easy in his mind, it being quite apparent that all the police
authorities were perfectly astray as yet. The next morning he
attended at the Guildhall to pick up what further news or
information he could upon the examination of the workmen; but he
failed, as this, being only a preliminary investigation, was held
in private. He elicited, however, from a very communicative civic
functionary of some sort, with whom he picked a conversation on the
subject, that a watchman who was stationed in Lombard Street had
that day come forward to state that a little after twelve on the
morning of Monday he had seen a very gentlemanly-looking person in
the street, whom he had spoken to, as he had at first thought he
must have come out of the sewer; but that the stranger had denied
doing so and the watchman could not swear that he <i>actually</i>
saw him emerge from the opening. Nor could he give any other
description of the party in question, save that he spoke very much
like a gentleman and had on a large cloak, which covered him from
head to foot, so Ralph&rsquo;s informant thought. &ldquo;Their
Worships&rdquo; could make nothing out of that.</p>

<p>As usual, the newspapers teemed with various and conflicting
statements; but the chief information they contained consisted of
the fact that several of the most active and intelligent officers
of Bow Street had been sent to the different seaports to examine
all suspicious persons about to leave the kingdom; but above all
things, the strictest search was everywhere to be made for the
missing workmen.</p>

<p>Rashleigh having thus learned all that he could for the present,
determined on going out of London for a short rime, and selected
Farnham, in Surrey, as his retreat, having been much taken with the
beauty of the town when he had spent a day or two there after his
exploit at Winchester. Here, then, he located himself, passing as
usual for a clerk upon a holiday.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after he arrived there, he was horrified by
reading in the newspaper an account of a great fire which had taken
place in Essex Street, Strand, where he had lodged, and which had
already consumed nearly the whole of the houses on one side of that
street. This news quite unmanned him because he had left nearly the
whole of his large stock of ill-acquired cash in the places of
concealment before mentioned at his lodgings. The only hope that
remained to him was that the side consumed might not be that on
which he had lived, as the paper did not specify the spot exactly.
Suspense, however, was intolerable, and feigning that he had
received a letter claiming his instant return to London, he took
coach the same night, and having arrived at the Golden Cross, flew
on the wings of anxiety to Essex Street. Here his very worst
anticipations were fully realised. His late lodgings were not
distinguishable amid the mass of smoking ruins, and the firemen.
who were all busied in pulling down those walls which still stood
but threatened to fall, would not allow Rashleigh to approach near
the spot on which the house he lived in had stood. Indeed, if they
had, it would have proved useless, for that dwelling appeared to
have suffered even more, if possible, than any of the rest, having
been completely gutted, the roof and floors fallen in; and the
workmen, at that moment, were levelling the front walls.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5" id="Chapter5"></a>Chapter
5</b>
</h2>

<p align="center" class="note">Forewarned by legends of my
youth,<br>
I trust not an associate&rsquo;s truth.</p>

<p>Overpowered by dismay, Ralph Rashleigh turned from the scene,
and felt as if he wished himself whelmed beneath the ruins of the
house which had thus destroyed all his hopes &mdash; so fondly
cherished &mdash; of future independence. Except about &pound;100
which he had taken with him into the country, not only all the
booty for which he had risked his life, but all his clothing, books
and other effects were thus lost to him for ever. Scarcely knowing
what he did, he went into a neighbouring public-house and
endeavoured by repeated libations to drown the memory of his
loss.</p>

<p>The effect of this debauch, combined with his mental anxiety,
threw him into a fever, from which he did not recover for several
weeks. In the mean time he was exposed to the mercenary extortions
of a stranger, who appeared to proportion his charges to his
knowledge of the contents of his guest&rsquo;s purse, which this
pattern for landlords had taken away on the occasion of
Ralph&rsquo;s becoming intoxicated the first night of his arrival
at the house. As soon, therefore, as Rashleigh became sufficiently
sensible to arrange his own business, he enquired for his cash,
when a bill was presented to him, amounting to upwards of &pound;56
for lodging and attendance, exclusive of the surgeon&rsquo;s charge
for visits and medicine, which last, when he received it, was
&pound;32 more. After these were paid Rashleigh found himself
master of only &pound;7 10s. 8d. and the suit of clothes he wore,
to begin the world anew with.</p>

<p>One effect of his last sickness had been, however, to disgust
him sincerely with his past life, and he determined upon living
honestly for the future, to do which he resolved upon procuring
employment again as a legal copyist. But some time must necessarily
elapse before he could hope to be sufficiently restored to health
for this purpose. In the mean time his scanty stock of cash would
soon be exhausted. He therefore left the public-house and took a
small furnished room in a court near the Temple, where after a week
or two he found himself so much better that one day he set out to
wait upon an old employer for the purpose of asking some work. He
was well received and promised employment on the morrow.</p>

<p>On his return from making this call, his evil fortune threw him
in the way of that associate who had assisted him in the robbery of
the house in Welbeck Street, and who was now in custody of an
officer for some other offence. This fellow hailed Rashleigh, and
the officer, who was on the lookout for another <i>pal</i> of his
prisoner, suspected from his manner that there was something in
common between them. As he looked with the usual eyes of a thief
catcher upon all the associates of thieves, so he now determined on
taking our hero into custody likewise. And this he shortly after
effected; for meeting a brother officer, he described the person of
Ralph Rashleigh to him, and in a few minutes more that unlucky
wight was arrested as he turned into the court where he lodged.</p>

<p>Resistance and enquiry were alike vain, and Ralph was lodged in
the watchhouse without even knowing the charge on which he had been
taken up. After a night of mental anxiety, which may be much more
easily conceived than described, he was brought before the sitting
magistrate at Bow Street next day. Here the officer first charged
Thomas Jenkins &mdash; <i>alias</i> Thomas Jones, ALIAS Thomas
Smith, with about twenty other <i>aliases</i> by which, it seemed,
Rashleigh&rsquo;s former associate had been known at some period of
his eventful career &mdash; with having been concerned in the
commission of a daring robbery at a gentleman&rsquo;s house in the
Adelphi; and certainly, as far as the evidence of the policeman
went, a very clear case indeed was made out against him, for it
appeared he was seen lurking near the house in question the evening
the robbery had been perpetrated, in company with an associate,
who, by the by, was sworn much to resemble the unfortunate Ralph.
Besides this, on searching his person, the duplicate of one of the
stolen articles had been found in his pocket. Again, his character,
which was notorious as that of a thief, bore hard against him, and
he was fully committed for trial at the Old Bailey.</p>

<p>It now became necessary to examine our adventurer; and the only
evidence against him being of a negative character, he was
requested to state his occupation, which he averred to be that of a
legal copyist. And as he most indignantly denied all knowledge of
Jenkins or his acts, he was remanded to prison for a week, in order
that rime might be afforded the police to make enquiry into the
truth of his assertion.</p>

<p>Behold Rashleigh once more in gaol, surrounded with the outcasts
of England&rsquo;s vast metropolis, destitute of money, of friends,
and of necessaries, a prey to the bitterest feelings of remorse,
and vainly vowing a complete reformation if ever he again obtained
his liberty. But this was not to be his lot, for his quondam
companion thought by telling the truth with reference to the former
robbery that his sentence might be rendered lighter, or perhaps, as
the gentleman robbed on that occasion was of high respectability
and influence, that he might even escape altogether with impunity.
Having therefore freely made a full confession, implicating
Rashleigh in the strongest manner, also the hackney coachman who
had assisted in the removal of the plate, together with the
Israelite who had bought it, the two last were arrested, and on the
day appointed for hearing Ralph upon the former charge, he was
placed at the bar with the hackney man, whom he hardly knew, and to
his utter confusion saw his former associate enter the witness-box
to give evidence against him.</p>

<p>The testimony of Jenkins was corroborated by many circumstances
which, though trivial of themselves, formed a very strong
aggregate, and by the unsatisfactory defence offered by Ralph,
coupled with the statement made by the policeman who had been
deputed to enquire how our adventurer lived, to the effect that
although he had enquired for employment at the place he stated on
the day he was taken into custody, and although he had been so
employed by the same person about eighteen months before, yet
nothing appeared as to how he had been obtaining a living in the
interim. And as, for reasons well known to the reader, he could by
no means clear up this point or bring evidence as to his honesty,
the investigation closed by his being fully committed to Newgate,
to take his trial at the ensuing sessions for the County of
Middlesex upon a charge of burglary, which at the time was a
capital offence, and one for which mercy was rarely granted to such
as were found guilty.</p>

<p>The van which conveyed the daily gleaning of crime collected by
the ever vigilant officers of Bow Street, and whose inmates were
strongly secured by leg-chains and handcuffs, contained, besides
Ralph Rashleigh, two prostitutes, committed on charges of pocket
picking, a girl apparently new from the country, who had been sent
to prison for having stolen a few articles of female finery from
her mistress, an apprentice boy, who was committed for robbing his
master&rsquo;s till, a hoary old beggar, to be tried on a charge of
assaulting a street keeper, and a ferocious-looking Irishman, who
had beaten his wife so severely that her life was despaired of. The
tears of the poor servant girl, who wailed most pitifully, the
obscenity of the two strumpets, the bitter lamentations of the
&lsquo;prentice boy, and the awful objurgations of the Irishman
formed a truly disgusting m&eacute;lange, and Ralph was almost glad
when the van stopped before the gloomy portals of the prison, now
rendered doubly repulsive by the darkness of the night and the
fitful glare of the torches held by the officers in attendance, to
light the prisoners into that abode of doom, which some of them
felt they should never more quit with life.</p>

<p>The surrounding mob, collected outside in vacant curiosity to
gaze upon the newly arrived criminals, hailed their appearance with
many obscene jests and very much brutal laughter; but upon their
entry into the porch or gate-house the outer doors were closed, and
Rashleigh felt his heart sink within him as the grating noise of
the sullen hinges and the clank of massy bolts seemed to cut him
off from the external world for ever.</p>

<p>Here a strict search was made upon the person of each; but their
money and other trifling articles were immediately returned to
them. The women were then taken in one direction, and the men,
among whom of course was Rashleigh, were ordered to follow a
turnkey in another, through a long and gloomy passage, which
displayed at intervals festoons of fetters of all shapes and sizes,
handcuffs, fire-arms of every kind and capacity, from the
bell-mouthed musketoon with bore as wide as a teacup to the pocket
pistol, carrying a bullet not much bigger than a pea. There was no
lack of naked cutlasses or swords, and many hideous, grim-looking
engines were suspended against these dreary walls, the names and
uses of which were equally unknown to Ralph; but his heated
imagination appropriated to each some foul or horrible purpose.
Frequent gates, composed solely of iron bars, crossed this gallery,
at each of which was stationed an attendant turnkey. The numerous
direful ideas conjured up by the mind of our captive in his transit
caused this avenue to appear interminable; but at length the whole
party stopped in a small room apparently used as an office, where a
clerk in attendance entered the personal description, together with
a statement of the dress worn by each of the new confines. They
were then directed to proceed onward, which they did through a
small yard surrounded by the gaol apartments, until they again
halted at a grated door. Having been admitted, they went up three
flights of stone stairs and were shown into a large ill-lighted
apartment, the unglazed windows of which, strongly secured by iron
bars, left no doubt of its purpose. Around this room, which
contained no other furniture than a rough table and two or three
forms, were lying many prisoners. Here they were received by a man
who had charge of the ward, as the apartment was called, and who
gave to each a portion of very dark-coloured bread, a mat similar
in material and appearance to those placed at the outer doors of
houses, and a coarse horse rug. The latter articles formed the bed
and bedding allowed by the civic authorities to such prisoners as
had none of their own.</p>

<p>The turnkey who had ushered them in now withdrew, and a scene
immediately ensued of which Rashleigh could give but a very faint
account, for one of the rugs having at this moment been thrown over
him from behind, he was immediately pulled to the ground and in a
few minutes stripped of every article of clothing: an operation
which he quickly discovered had been simultaneously performed upon
all those who had arrived with him. Remonstrance being of no avail,
nothing remained but patience, and of this inestimable quality
Ralph had lately acquired a sufficient portion to enable him to
submit in silence. When the uproar had somewhat subsided he secured
his rug and mat, spread them upon the ground, and lay down to
sleep. The numberless myriads of vermin, however, together with the
continual noise of conversation, and other nameless annoyance
prevented his doing so for many hours; and when at last he did
rest, the intense cold, from which his scanty covering but ill
defended him, caused him soon to awake, after which he lay tossing
and tumbling until his bones were sore, revolving many bitter
thoughts of the past am anticipations for the future.</p>

<p>At length the wished-for morning dawned, and our adventurer had
an opportunity of observing the nature of his place of confinement
more a leisure; but he could find nothing very cheering in the
view. The room was of great size, furnished, as before stated, only
with a rough table and benches, together with the rugs and mats
which formed the bedding of the prisoners, who seemed to be in
number from thirty to forty. When it became quite light Ralph saw a
quantity of clothing lying in the middle of the floor, which he
examined and found that his own was among them. He then quickly
dressed and went to sit by the fire. In a short time many others
joined him, and numberless questions were asked by the former
inmates of the newcomers, as to what they were &ldquo;in
for&rdquo;, etc. in making replies to these queries the time sped
away until eight o&rsquo;clock, when several buckets full of gruel
were brought in, which served those who, like Ralph had no means of
purchasing any other food for breakfast. With some of the bread he
had received the night before our adventurer made a hearty meal, to
which the abstinence of the previous four and twenty hours no doubt
contributed in a very great degree.</p>

<p>After breakfast Ralph went down to the yard, the doors of all
the sleeping-wards being by this time thrown open. The prisoners
attended prayers in the chapel, after which Rashleigh joined a
number of others who were performing their ablutions at a pump.
This necessary operation concluded, the new-comer began to look
around him, to see if among his fellow-confines he could recognise
any one he knew. This investigation had no effect for some time,
until he perceived a bustle among the assembled crowd, whose
attention seemed to be concentrated upon the outer entrance of the
yard, where a turnkey ever and anon called out the name of a
prisoner, who then answered, &ldquo;Over&rdquo;, as loud as he
could bawl and ran to the door to receive a message or parcel, or
be shown into the visiting room, accordingly as a message or a
visitor awaited his attention.</p>

<p>The name of William Tyrrell, having been vociferated in this
way, was replied to by a person whose face appeared familiar to
Rashleigh, who asked another man close by for information as to who
Tyrrell was.&rsquo; The former replied that he was a first-rate
swindler, then confined for twelve months, having, been <i>bowled
out</i> in some of his malpractices. This account did not
altogether satisfy our hero, who was confident he had known Tyrrell
in some other circumstances than such as had been detailed to him,
though he could not at the time remember how or where they had met,
and he now awaited with some impatience for his reappearance. In
the mean time the inmates of this vast prison commenced their daily
amusements or occupations. The greater part of them, breaking up
into knots, retired either into the wards or out-of-sight comers of
the yard, to form what they called <i>schools</i>, for the pursuit
of their favourite pastime, gambling; but cards being prohibited, a
number of ingenious devices were resorted to, among which the most
popular appeared to be the tossing up of one, two, or three
halfpence at once, technically termed <i>gaffing</i>. A scene now
ensued to which the uproar of Babel or the din of Pandemonium must
have been perfect peace, the gamblers staking often their clothing
on the chances, until at length some of them were shortly covered
only by scanty and wretched rags begged from the more fortunate,
who in their turn were stripped by other successful competitors.
The various vicissitudes of the game were marked by the most horrid
imprecations, of a power and energy only to be appreciated by those
who have ever haunted the <i>classic solitudes</i> of Billingsgate,
or the secluded shades of Chequer Alley and Winfield Street. In
several instances the opponents resorted to blows, when rings were
formed, seconds selected, and all the minutiae of prize-fighting
rigidly adhered to, the bystanders encouraging their respective
favourites, and freely betting their money, articles of apparel,
and even their food on the issue of the contest.</p>

<p>Amid this uproar some were moodily fixed in anxious expectation,
awaiting the arrival of a friend or relative with news from
without, or a promised supply of cash or clothing. Another few were
pacing the yard alone, &ldquo;in silent meditation fancy
free&rdquo;. Some who, like Rashleigh, expected no visitors, and to
whom the scene at any rate offered the attraction of novelty, were
listlessly gazing, first at one part of this strange
<i>m&eacute;lange</i>, and then at another. But nowhere could he
observe any traces of that sorrow or despair which might have been
supposed the fit accompaniment of such a place, where many of those
whom he saw knew full well that &ldquo;they were sure to be
<i>twisted</i> (hanged) at the next sessions&rdquo;, as they daily
expressed themselves to that effect. On the contrary, the only
object of most appeared to be the enjoyment of the passing hour,
varied in a few cases and at intervals by deep-laid schemes to
defeat their two great enemies, the public justice and their
private prosecutors, as well as by cunningly devised projects of
plunder to be put into execution when they should again recover
their liberty.</p>

<p>After a short time the door of the yard opened, and the person
who had answered to the name of Tyrrell reappeared. He now passed
quite close to Rashleigh, who remembered him as a person whom upon
one of his country excursions he had rescued from the clutches of a
constable in whose custody he was proceeding to Hertford Gaol on a
charge of robbery; which service Ralph had performed by effecting
the intoxication of this <i>vigilant</i> guardian of the public
peace, when he stole the key of the room in which Tyrrell had been
confined and let him out, providing him with a supply of money to
assist his flight. Rashleigh now addressed this man, enquiring how
he had got into his present confinement. The latter, upon
recognising one who had rendered him such an essential obligation,
after a few preliminary remarks, informed our adventurer that being
sentenced a year&rsquo;s imprisonment in the <i>Start</i> (Newgate)
he had, as was customary at that time, obtained the situation of a
wardsman (person appointed to keep order in each of the sleeping
apartments) and that, by a dexterous application of some of the
renowned <i>oil of palms</i> to one of the gaol officers, he had
been placed in what was considered the best room of the prison,
where he had ample opportunities for enjoying himself and also,
strange to say, of getting a good deal of money. He then enquired
into Rashleigh&rsquo;s case and present circumstances, when,
finding that the latter could scarcely be worse, he ended by
inviting his newly arrived friend to share his mess until the
sessions, promising also to get him removed into the same ward with
himself. Ralph joyfully acceded to this arrangement. Never before
had he found so apposite an illustration of the old proverb,
&ldquo;A friend in need is a friend indeed.&rdquo; Shortly after
this, the principal turnkey on that side of the gaol coming to the
gate to preside over the distribution of the meat and soup allowed
for the dinner of the confines, Tyrrell preferred his request to
that awful functionary, and duly supported it by a recurrence to
the usual all-powerful <i>Argentine</i> arguments commonly applied
in such cases, and which, in this, proved effectual; for Rashleigh
obtained permission to change his lodging to that occupied by his
friend, whom he immediately accompanied to the famed apartment then
known as the &ldquo;Smugglers&rsquo; Ward&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The first view of this room impressed our hero with a much more
cheerful opinion of the comforts attainable even in a felons&rsquo;
gaol than any place he had yet seen within the walls of Newgate.
Here were many very clean-looking beds. Coarse curtains screened
portions of the room and, in fact, subdivided it into small
apartments, which were rented by those among the confines who were
opulent enough to afford the payment of what Trapbois would have
called &ldquo;a fair con-sid-e-ra-tion&rdquo; for it in the shape
of a weekly rent to the wardsman for such an indulgence. A few
decent tables and chairs, with many other miscellaneous articles of
comfort and even luxury also were to be seen. In the whole, this
portion of Newgate presented an infinitely preferable appearance to
many houses outside its walls, independent of the parish of Saint
Giles.</p>

<p>Tyrrell now introduced Ralph to his own berth, which was formed
like the rest by curtains, and in addition to two decent beds,
etc., contained several shelves, with drawers and a table. In fact,
it presented the appearance of a small huckster&rsquo;s shop, to
which purpose it was actually appropriated; for in a few minutes a
number of persons applied for tea, sugar, coffee, milk, eggs,
bacon, butter and many other comestibles, the supplying of which
occupied both Tyrrell and our hero, who was quickly installed into
office as his assistant, during more than an hour. Tyrrell then
ordered breakfast to be brought, acquainting his new messmate that
the inmates of the Smugglers&rsquo; Ward, justly considering
themselves as the aristocracy of the entire community within the
walls of Newgate, were by far too independent to adhere to the same
hours for taking their meals as were observed by the common order
of criminals. Accordingly, though they were obliged to go to chapel
every morning at nine o&rsquo;clock, which occupied half an hour,
they very carefully resumed their beds as soon as they returned,
nor did they rise again until noon, by which time the ward had been
thoroughly cleaned out, their boots or shoes and clothes brushed,
and their breakfasts prepared by their <i>servants</i>; of whom
each person of high <i>ton</i>, who had plenty of <i>tin</i>, kept
one to himself; in other cases two or three of inferior means
clubbed their messes together and supported one <i>slavey</i> among
them.</p>

<p>These slaveys, or servants, were a sort of <i>pariahs</i> among
the prisoners, chiefly <i>Johnny Raws</i>, or country chaps,
apprentices, or others, who had no acquaintances to assist them
while in gaol, and who were not possessed of sufficient dexterity
in gambling to supply their wants by any of the various cheating
tricks resorted to among the knowing ones. They were consequently
glad to earn a trifle of cash and some food, by administering to
the necessities and submitting to the various practical jokes or
tyrannical tricks of their imperious masters; for Ralph had ample
opportunities of observing that many of the so-called highflyers of
Newgate were not a whit behind those whom they copied &mdash; the
gay and gilded butterflies of fashion who fluttered in the external
world &mdash; in scorning those whom fate or fortune had for the
time placed in subordinate situations to themselves.</p>

town<i>,<br></i>A thorough varmint, and a real <i>swell.</i></p>

<p>Tyrrell&rsquo;s attendant having produced their breakfast, which
consisted of coffee, eggs, honey and toast, our confines did ample
justice to the vivers, after which, Rashleigh having questioned his
companion respecting his past history, Tyrrell observed that in
order to understand it, it would be necessary to begin at an early
period of his life; but, as there was nothing else to do, it would
form as good a pastime as any other, and he began as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father was a noted <i>fence</i>, and it may easily be
imagined, in consequence, that what I saw in my paternal mansion
during my early childhood did not greatly predispose me to a life
of honesty. In fact, I was taken notice of by the thieves who
resorted to our house for the purpose of selling whatever they had
stolen. These gentry were lost in admiration of my dexterity, for
at nine years of age I could pick the pocket of the sharpest man
among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talents like mine were not to be hidden in obscurity; so
one day, after I had lost all my <i>browns</i> gaffing with a
<i>chummy</i>, and my old dad had refused to give me any more, I
watched my opportunity and stole from him a watch and a small lot
of silver spoons, which I took to an acquaintance of his in the
same line, whom I amused by a false tale of my dexterity in
stealing them. He willingly bought the whole, without asking any
troublesome questions, and told me with an air of patronage I shall
never forget, &lsquo;that he always thought I should turn out a
<i>most</i> <i>splendid thief</i>!!!&rsquo; Egad, I believe
<i>he</i> considered this to be the highest praise he could bestow;
and for my part, I thought more of it, by an immeasurable degree,
than I should, had he predicted I should live to be a Bishop!</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the money thus acquired, I forsook the East end for
the West, and soon fell in with a highly distinguished member of
the <i>swell mob</i>, now, alas, luxuriating at Botany Bay. This
worthy had often praised my consummate skill in the art of
<i>conveyancing</i>, and by such a distinguished artist was I now
taken into protection. Under his auspices it was that I acquired
that <i>savoir vivre</i> which I have often been complimented upon
in after life, and to which, no doubt, may be ascribed the singular
success that has generally attended my operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We carried on the war against the pockets of all and
sundry for two years with prolific industry, until at last, in a
moment of rashness, my companion essayed his skill upon the person
of no less redoubtable a victim than Sir R. B. the celebrated
police magistrate, whom he eased of his pocket book, containing a
considerable sum, just at the door of his own office! From that
instant our fortunes declined. The officers of his establishment,
after the affront offered to their chief, appeared to be each
endowed with more eyes than Argus himself. We were had up before
the beak three times in one fortnight on suspicion of various
offences, and though acquitted of any actual criminality, yet my
companion was sent three months to gaol as a suspected thief, while
I was ordered to be received into the <i>refuge</i>. This
destination I obtained from my obstinacy in refusing to disclose my
real name or the residence of my parents, which I was loath to do
because I feared my father might be ungentlemanly enough to
remember the little <i>faux pas</i> I had committed when I left
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this benevolent institution for reclaiming the
destitute youth of London I remained four years, much against my
will, in which period I learned to read and write, for my education
had hitherto been very much neglected. Besides, I obtained an
insight into the calling of a snob, to which gentle occupation I
was apprenticed at the expiration of my servitude, a master being
chosen for me by the institution, who in consideration of my
services for three more years, engaged to provide me with food and
clothing and to perfect me in the knowledge of that necessary
craft, which is said to have been patronised by Saint Crispin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This benevolent gentleman added to the other obligations
he wished to confer upon me, an intimate acquaintance with short
commons &mdash; and a long stirrup-leather. But after my close
confinement in the Refuge, I can assure you I had other notions of
the sweets of liberty than to waste my fife among the awls and ends
of a cobbler&rsquo;s shop; so I very soon absconded from my master,
and taking the road to Bristol, with a scanty stock of clothing and
a still more slender supply of cash, I began the world anew. I had
travelled many miles before the night fell, and I found myself near
a small village, to the inn of which I hastened for shelter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the night an alarm of fire roused all the inmates at
once. I had slept in an apartment on the ground floor, and was soon
in safety; but the case was far different with some others, because
the flames had attained great power before they were discovered. It
appeared they had broken out in a fireplace that adjoined the only
staircase which the house contained. Consequently, the retreat of
those who occupied the upper rooms was quickly cut off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A scene of dire confusion now took place. The people of
the inn, with the help of bystanders, endeavoured to save their
property; and they were so busy that they did not remember an
elderly gentleman and his daughter, who slept in two of the upper
apartments situated at the back of the house, and who now appeared
at a window, beseeching for help. By this time the flames had burst
from the openings beneath them and threatened imminent danger to
any who should even approach to set up a ladder for their escape.
The landlord having offered a &pound;10 note to anybody that could
rescue them, I determined on trying to earn so considerable a
reward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having first stripped myself to my shirt, I wetted a
blanket, which I fastened round me, and then boldly placed a ladder
against the window. The old gentleman, in the mean time, had
fainted, and his daughter refused to abandon him. I therefore ran
up the ladder, and at the urgent entreaty of the girl, that I would
save her father, I managed with some difficulty to get him out of
the window upon my back, and though I was fairly enveloped in
flame, I reached the ground with my burden in safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scene now was awful, for the whole of the lower part
of the inn on that side presented nothing but one sheet of fire,
which, bursting forth at every lower opening, licked the walls and
clambered the side of the house in volumes of flame. But the beauty
of the lovely girl, who now could only be seen at intervals,
wringing her hands in a paroxysm of despair at the upper window,
was too deeply impressed upon my mind to suffer her to perish so
dreadfully without an effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taking another wet blanket with me, I rushed up the
ladder once more, and throwing it around the young lady, caught her
on my shoulder, and began my descent just in time; for I had not
made two steps downwards, when the floor on which she had stood
fell in with a tremendous crash, shaking the whole building and
emitting a shower of burning flakes of timber. I felt almost
paralyzed for an instant. The girl fainted on my shoulder, and I
had great difficulty to keep my feet. The suffocating heat nearly
deprived me of breath; but just at this moment the ladder slipped,
which recalled me, and with convulsive energy I grasped its sides
between my knees, and thus slid in half a second to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brief as my passage had been, my hair and even my
eyebrows were burned, my right shoulder painfully scorched, and to
crown all, the force with which I alighted on <i>Terra firma</i>
had severely sprained my ankle, so that I had scarcely handed my
lovely burden to her father, when I fell down insensible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a long illness, during which the greatest attention
was paid to me, when I recovered strength enough to take cognisance
of those around me, I was informed that I now lay in a farm-house
near the village where the fire had happened, that the old
gentleman whose daughter I had saved had caused me to be brought
there, having liberally paid the inmates for their attention to me,
and that he had left orders that when I could bear the journey I
was to proceed to his residence, situated at a place called
King&rsquo;s Weston, in Somersetshire, for which purpose he had
left me a sum of money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The landlord of the inn frequently came to see me, and
indeed, among all the neighbours, I was considered quite a hero. My
convalescence was pleasant enough, and I set forth to pay my
respects to Mr Waterton, which I found was the name of the
gentleman in question. I had previously sent a letter to him,
returning my thanks for his kindness, and stating the day on which
I intended to start, so that on my arrival per coach at Bristol, I
found a servant with a horse and chaise, waiting to convey me
forward to my destination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was most cordially received by Mr W., his son and
daughter, and when my health was re-established, the old gentleman
enquired my situation and prospects. I told him that I was an
orphan, bred up by an uncle who had taught me the trade of a
shoemaker, but that my protector being dead, I was travelling in
search of work when I fell in with him. Mr Waterton asked me if I
would accept a situation to attend his son, who was about to
travel, promising that upon our return he would do something more
for me. I embraced this proposal very joyfully, being most desirous
to see the world. Accordingly, I visited nearly every capital in
Europe with this young gentleman, who always treated me rather as a
friend than a servant. I wanted for nothing money could supply and
consequently had no temptation to resume my old game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length, the vessel in which we had sailed from Naples
for Constantinople was wrecked upon one of the Greek islands. The
whole of the crew and passengers, in order to save themselves, got
into boats; but as she struck the rock in the night-time, myself
and my master were separated in the confusion. The boat in which I
was &mdash; with several others &mdash; stood for the land, which
appeared at no great distance; but the violence of the sea was so
great that in a short time the oars were swept from the hands of
the seamen, and immediately afterwards the skiff upset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember nothing more, until it appeared to me I awoke.
I then found myself lying nearly naked on a bare sea-beach so far
from the water that I could hardly conceive how I had got there;
but it seems that in these parts the fury of the waves will
sometimes lift a large boat several hundred feet on the dry land. I
looked about and saw that the whole shore for some distance was
strewed with fragments of wreck. Among the rest were several
chests, one of which I recognised as having belonged to a young
gentleman passenger named Alleyn, who had been in the same boat
with myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was no time to be scrupulous, for I was nearly
perishing with cold; so, after some little difficulty, I broke open
Mr Alleyn&rsquo;s chest and to my great comfort found the contents
were most of them dry, as the box was very strong and lined with
tin. Among many other things I found a supply of warm clothing,
which I much wanted, and therefore helped myself to a complete
change. I found also a small bag containing a considerable number
of pieces of foreign gold coin and a large bag of Spanish dollars,
which I also secured. I now thought of looking after inhabitants,
if there were any, and accordingly ascended a range of cliffs which
overlooked the shore that was the scene of our disaster, and turned
my eyes inland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prospect was anything but cheering, for as far as my
sight extended I could see nothing but a wild sort of heath, with a
few stunted bushes here and there. At a considerable distance the
view was shut in by a range of hills, beyond which a slight smoke
appeared. The nearest way to these bills lay along the sea-beach,
to which I accordingly returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On repassing the fragments of wreck, I thought I might as
well drag the most portable chests as far as I could out of the
reach of the waves. I set busily to work to do so, and in my
researches I stumbled upon the bodies of several of my unfortunate
boat companions, which had before been hidden from my view by the
rocks among which they lay. I examined them very anxiously, hoping
to find one at least alive; for never did I feel so utterly
abandoned and destitute. But the rough and jagged rocks among which
they had been cast had completely crushed them to atoms. it was
with great difficulty that I could recognise any of them; but among
those I knew I discovered poor Mr Alleyn, whose clothes I had made
free with. While I was endeavouring to draw the senseless corpses
of my late shipmates up a little higher on the shore, I saw a man
coming towards me, whose appearance was savage and uncouth enough
to alarm a person better provided with means of resistance than
myself; for, in fact, I possessed none but nature&rsquo;s
weapons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The person who now approached me bore a fowling-piece of
singular appearance, marvellously long in the barrel. He was clad
from head to foot in a sort of pelisse, or cloak, apparently made
of sheepskin, with the wool outside. He wore a silken or velvet
skull-cap, much embroidered with gold and silver thread. Boots of
untanned leather completed his costume. Rude, however, as he
seemed, I soon found by his gestures that his meaning was friendly;
for although I could not understand a word he said, yet the tone of
his voice, and the compassionate glances he cast at my dead
companions assured me that I might hope for hospitality and
assistance from him. He laid aside his gun, helped me to carry the
relics of my shipmates, which we covered as decently as we could
with some sails washed up by the storm, and then motioned me to
accompany him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the mean time I attempted to converse with him by
trying all the scraps of languages I had picked up on my travels,
but without any success. At last I desisted, and we pursued our
path in silence. After walking about a mile along the shore, a
sudden turn round a projecting cliff brought us a view of a small
village, consisting of about three-score houses, most romantically
situated at the head of a small bay. We soon reached one of the
best in appearance, and my guide proceeded to issue several orders,
apparently to his family. In a short time a small quantity of black
bread, stewed meat, and a bottle of wine were placed before me. I
needed but little pressing to satisfy my hunger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I was thus engaged, a venerable-looking old man,
whose white beard swept his girdle, came in. He made an obeisance
to me and then began to speak in a sort of broken Italian, asking
me whether I did not belong to the large ship that had been wrecked
last night. I told him I was a passenger, and enquired whether
anyone else had reached the shore, to which he replied that he knew
not, for I was the first who had been seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I now requested that he would endeavour to obtain
assistance for the burial of my late companions and the security of
the effects which lay on the beach, to which he replied that a
party of the villagers had already gone to fetch the dead, in order
to see to their interment in the churchyard. I proposed going to
meet them, as I had no doubt that plunder was the object they had
in view; but we had scarcely set out when we met these honest
people returning with four of the corpses. They were carefully laid
out upon boards in a little half-ruined chapel, where, by the
direction of the old man, whom I now found to be a priest, several
of the matrons commenced preparations for the burial. In short, the
whole of them were brought in by noon, and having been prepared for
interment, each being sewn up in a sort of sheet, the priest read
the funeral service, and they were committed to the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the mean time the villagers had brought most of the
chests and portable articles that had drifted on shore to their
dwellings. All of these they gave up to me; but I feared to claim
any except the chests, etc. of Mr Alleyn, who I knew was dead, and
I placed all the rest at the disposal of the padre, who told me
that the place being a dependency upon the Ionian islands, he would
write to Corfu by the first vessel, so that the authorities there
might decide what should be done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the mean time men had been dispatched to all parts of
the islet, in order to look out for other traces of the wreck and
to search for the survivors, if there might be any such, from the
ill-fated vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remained in the same cottage three days before any
opportunity occurred for my removal, when a small galley, which
came for fish from Naples, touched at the village. In this I took
my departure, having in vain endeavoured to make the poor islanders
accept of any remuneration for the trouble they had been at. The
priest, who was the only person with whom I could maintain a broken
sort of conversation, assured me, when I spoke of payment for the
services rendered me, that the authorities at Corfu always
satisfied both himself and flock for all the assistance they could
afford a British subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finding that they would not receive any recompense for
either my food or lodging, I bade them adieu. And ever since that
time, when I have heard people railing at mankind, and vowing that
there was neither honour, honesty, or hospitality left upon earth,
I have thought of that lonely Greek islet, where the inhabitants,
though as poor as poor can be, had yet extended protection and
friendship to a solitary helpless being at his utmost need, without
hope of reward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I soon reached the gay city of Naples again, and used
every exertion, during my stay of near two months in that luxurious
haunt of pleasure, to discover whether my master had escaped the
wreck with life. But I was unsuccessful in all my endeavours, and I
determined on returning to England, in the faint hope that young Mr
Waterton might have arrived there, as there were many homeward
bound vessels then sailing on those seas. I ardently trusted this
might prove the case, for I really respected, I may say, loved, my
master with great sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have informed you that one of Mr
Alleyn&rsquo;s chests, of which I had taken possession, bore his
name painted upon it in full. This being sent to the hotel at which
I proposed to stop the day before I went thither myself, the people
of the house dubbed me upon arrival, &lsquo;Il Signor
Alleyn&rsquo;. As they had thus converted me into a gentleman, I
had very little relish for again descending needlessly to the
station of a servant. Besides, I fancied my honours sat quite as
becomingly upon me as gentility did upon several of my countrymen,
for, to speak Heaven&rsquo;s truth, never were there such a
collection of unlicked cubs as some of the <i>Signori Inglese</i>
who abode in those days at the good town of Naples. Again, I found
upon examination that with cash and trinkets, I was possessed of
something above &pound;1,100, which would at any rate, I thought,
enable me to support my assumed character until I reached my
fatherland, when I resolved upon dropping it and returning to my
patron. But you know the old saying, &lsquo;Man <i>pro_poses but
Heaven</i> dis_poses.&rsquo; It so happened that among the
passengers in the same ship with myself from Naples to England
there was a young Irish gentleman named Power O&rsquo;Donahoe, who
had stayed at the <i>Casa Inglese</i> during all the time I had
been there. Because I had never joined any of the other geniuses in
laughing at his brogue or in ridiculing his blunders, this young
man, with all the proverbial warmth of his country, formed quite a
friendship for me, and when we arrived in London, nothing would
suit him but I must go to the same hotel as he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In an evil hour I consented, and we drank, danced, diced
and wenched together for three months with great &eacute;clat. I
was introduced into fashionable society by Mr O&rsquo;Donahoe, who
always told his friends that I was a young West Indian proprietor
of great fortune, which indeed, through various hints I had
purposely dropped, he really believed me to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The roystering sort of life I now led rapidly attenuated
my finances, and I began to obtain articles upon credit. Thus I
quickly discovered the great truth that there is not upon earth a
more credulous animal than a London tradesman; and by Heaven, they
almost obliged but quite enticed me to swindle them. For eighteen
months I thus lived upon the fat of the land, clad in purple and
fine linen, faring sumptuously every day at the expense of others,
and partaking most plentifully of all the pleasures the metropolis
can afford, until at last duns became so troublesome that I was
obliged to absent myself from the scene for a while. It was after
an unsuccessful attempt at robbery that you first met me. I then
returned to my old haunts, where I shortly afterwards took a
furnished house and made free with nearly all its contents,
together with a pair of job horses and a curricle. But that was my
last feat, for I was in a few days after sold by one of my
<i>pals</i>, who betrayed me into the hands of the traps, and
&mdash; in short here I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh, having heard Tyrrell&rsquo;s story to an end,
complimented him much upon his talents and good fortune in escaping
so easily, shortly after which they were all locked up for the
night. Parties of the ward inmates being formed, some sang songs,
some gambled, some related their exploits to others, and all drank
most plentifully, there being in those days no lack of either
spirits, wine or porter to be found within the precincts of His
Majesty&rsquo;s Gaol, Newgate. Porter, indeed, was allowed by the
regulations. and those who had money found no difficulty in
obtaining all the rest.</p>

<p>The manner in which the prison days were spent being so much
alike, it is needless to do more than say that every day they went
to prayers, ate, drank, sang, gambled, and drank again. In fact, it
would appear that all the knowing ones were quite as comfortable in
gaol as anywhere else; and those who were not fully initiated into
all the arts of thieving and villainy when first they went
<i>into</i> prison were sure, at least, of being quite proficient
by the time they came out of it. There was not the slightest
attempt at classification, save that arising from the sale of
superior accommodations to those who could pay for them. In all
other respects the hoary thief, who had passed a long life in
successful violation of the law, was here placed in the same
apartment with the raw shop-boy, confined for robbing his
master&rsquo;s till. And the freedom from restraint and
self-congratulation of manner with which these old practitioners in
knavery boasted of their exploits, and the glowing pictures they
frequently drew of the enjoyments derivable from a life of plunder,
seldom failed in making confirmed and hardened villains of all
those who listened to them.</p>

<p>In this manner the time sped until the week before the sessions
arrived, that period which some wished for, others dreaded, and all
prepared to meet. This was indeed a busy season with the inmates of
the Smugglers&rsquo; Ward. They had counsel to fee, attorneys to
instruct, witnesses to bribe and defences to draw up. Rashleigh,
having once been in some sort a member of the legal profession, now
found his services much in request, to write letters, prepare
statements and adapt questions for the cross-examination of
inflexible evidences. For all this he obtained a considerable sum
of money, so that he was not only enabled to fee counsel for
himself, but also to procure some decent apparel for his
approaching trial. He, however, entertained very slight hopes of an
acquittal, the evidence of his quondam associate being quite strong
and conclusive. Besides, there was every prospect of strenuous
endeavours being made on the part of the Crown to secure his
conviction; as unless he were found guilty, the Israelite indicted
for receiving the plate he had stolen was sure of an acquittal
likewise. And it will be remembered that the thief catchers of the
metropolis had long been endeavouring to suppress so noted a
<i>fence</i> as the person in question was well known to be.
Indeed, for several years they had been upon the alert, ardently
longing for the opportunity, which now seemed to offer itself to
them by chance. Under these circumstances Ralph saw no prospect
save that of conviction before him; yet he was resolved not to omit
anything that might tend to his escape from justice. With this view
he prepared his defence with all the skill of which he was master,
and thus occupied, the day fixed for the commencement of the
sessions came upon him: those sessions which were fraught with the
destinies of upwards of four hundred human beings of both sexes,
all ages and conditions.</p>

<p>The inmates of Newgate were informed by the Calendar of the
order in which the trials were to occur, and the arched gateway
through which the prisoners returned from the Sessions House being
close by the ward in which our adventurer now lived, he had ample
opportunities for observing the features and deportment of the
confines, both before and after they received their sentences. But
in few cases indeed could he perceive either regret or compunction.
Those who were condemned to any periods less than seven
years&rsquo; transportation triumphed almost as much as if they had
been acquitted. The boys particularly, who were very numerous,
jested with the greatest <i>sang froid</i> at the idea of a
flogging, which most of them had been sentenced to receive, and
which they scoffingly termed a &ldquo;teasing&rdquo;. Those who had
been doomed to seven years&rsquo; transportation called it a
&ldquo;small fine of eighty-four months&rdquo;. Even those who had
been sentenced for fourteen years or life to the same punishment
had some joke to pass on the subject to their fellows in the yard
as they went through to their several destinations. As for those
sentenced to <i>die</i>, they endeavoured to eclipse all the others
in the daring obscenity and gross brutality of their jests.</p>

<p>By some accident a number of housebreakers were ordered for
trial on the same day, and Ralph&rsquo;s blood ran cold on being
informed by one that had just returned from the Court, that all had
been found guilty, and all had been doomed to death, or as his
informant expressed it, &ldquo;that they were <i>celling</i> them
like b &mdash;&mdash; y bullocks&rdquo;, meaning, sending them to
the condemned cells. The crime of burglary had been peculiarly
prevalent in the metropolis during the previous winter, and it
seemed as if the jurors were determined not to allow any of the
accused to escape. It was therefore with a depressed mind that our
adventurer obeyed the summons which placed him before his judge at
the criminal bar. As usual in this well-known Court, there was an
ample assemblage of spectators, most of them being of the lowest
class. Some of these were gossiping, some cracking nuts, others
jokes on various subjects. Upon the appearance of the prisoner, the
lawyers began to handle their papers with a business-like air, and
the solemn farce called a trial began.</p>

<p>Ralph Rashleigh was indicted by that name for having on a
certain day and date, set forth in the arraignment, with force and
arms feloniously broken into and entered the dwelling-house of
Westley Shortland Esquire in the night-time, and for having therein
stolen taken and carried away a large quantity of silver plate his
property contrary to the statute and against the peace of Our
Soverign Lord the King his crown and dignity, the indictment being
interlarded with a vast number of other legal phrases. To this, of
course, he pleaded &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo;, and put himself upon
his trial.</p>

<p>A jury was now empanelled, and the advocate for the prisoner
having declined to challenge any of their number, the case
proceeded. The learned counsel for the Crown, after an eloquent
exordium, in which he dwelt at great length upon the many daring
depredations recently committed under covert of the night upon the
properties of the peaceful and well-disposed inhabitants of the
town, proceeded to give a sketch of the case in question as he had
been informed it would be proved in evidence; and he wound up by
reverting to the skilful and adroit manner in which the robbery had
been perpetrated, at the same time charitably requesting the
jurymen to dismiss all prejudices from their minds and to try the
case solely by the statement of the witnesses. Nevertheless, he
<i>kindly averred</i> his private opinion to be that the prisoner
at the bar was a scoundrel of the deepest dye, steeped in crime to
the very lips.</p>

<p>The evidence of Mr Shortland&rsquo;s butler was now taken. He
swore that having obtained his master&rsquo;s permission to pay a
visit to a sick friend for a day or two, he had collected the whole
of the plate under his care and safely locked the articles in the
pantry on the night in question. A female servant next deposed to
finding the pantry locked up but all its valuable contents missing
on the following morning. The approver then completed the whole
case by giving a clear and distinct detail of the manner in which
the prisoner and himself had actually committed the crime in
question. His evidence was sustained by that of the hackney
coachman, who had also been admitted to give testimony on the part
of the Crown. And though Rashleigh&rsquo;s counsel most cunningly
cross-questioned both these latter personages, and elicited from
Jenkins in particular the admission that he had been a thief from
his earliest youth and of his having been actively engaged in the
commission of every species of crime during a period of twenty-five
years, yet the damning fact of the want of any regular or honest
mode of livelihood on the part of Rashleigh rendered all efforts
abortive. After a brief pause, the jury, without retiring, found
Ralph Rashleigh guilty of the crime of burglary.</p>

<p>A moment of thrilling suspense followed. The recorder, amid an
awful silence, then addressed the convict, pointing out the
enormity of his offence, dwelt at some length upon the villainous
career of crime which it was evident he had passed through, and
which he was now about to consummate by an ignominious end, and
finally passed upon him the sentence of execution in the customary
formula. Ralph scarcely saw his judge or heard a syllable of what
he said, for notwithstanding this event had been in a great measure
fully anticipated by him, yet at last the reality of the blow fell
upon him with a force that was absolutely paralyzing. After having
cast a hurried and furtive glance around the Court upon the
spectators who thronged it, he stepped mechanically out of the
dock. No eye appeared to pity or regard him. Most of the auditory
were already occupied in speculations upon the probable fate of the
next prisoner, who now excited their attention as he approached in
his turn to take his trial.</p>

<p>The prisoner and his guide traversed the long and gloomy vaulted
passage that separated the gaol from the Sessions Hall in silence,
and at last reached the yard Ralph had so lately quitted for trial.
Tyrrell stood there. He asked, &ldquo;What luck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph had not time to answer before the turnkey shouted out,
&ldquo;Cells!&rdquo; to another officer who there awaited to
receive the prisoners.</p>

<p>With a significant gesture Tyrrell shook Rashleigh by the hand,
saying, &ldquo;Keep up your heart, my boy. Never drop down,&rdquo;
and he slipped a small packet to his friend at the same time.</p>

<p>Rashleigh returned the pressure with a sickly smile as he was
hurried off. They now passed through several yards and many
passages, until at last they reached the condemned side and were
ushered into a large room, the counterpart of that comfortless
domicile in which our confine had spent his first night within
these dreary walls.</p>

<p>Here, though it was as yet only the third day of the sessions,
there were no less than forty-six men, most of them very young and
all sentenced to die by the hangman&rsquo;s hated noose. Yet with
all this, there was not a single instance of gravity, far less of
that gloom which might have reasonably been expected as a
Concomitant to these circumstances. They hailed Ralph&rsquo;s
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> with loud cries of &ldquo;Fish-oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of them crowded around him to ask his crime, to which
briefly replying, &ldquo;<i>a crack</i>,&rdquo; (housebreaking) he
was told that twenty-eight of those present were condemned for
similar offences, and one fellow remarked that &ldquo;the
<i>scragsman</i> (hangman) would get a rare benefit that
touch&rdquo;. All present joined in a hearty peal of laughter at
this sally, as if it had been some brilliant jest that called forth
their admiration.</p>

<p>Ralph being now invited to dinner by a quondam companion from
the Smugglers&rsquo; Ward, they sat down together, speculating
during their meal upon the probable number that would actually
suffer that sessions. It was pretty well known that not one-fourth
of the men sentenced to die ever were hung at that time; but yet,
as none could tell upon whom the lot would fall, every man, even
the most criminal, enjoyed the illusions of hope. Indeed, whatever
were the motives for extending mercy to any, they were sufficiently
obscure to set the most astute calculators among even the officers
of the prison at defiance, sometimes hardened old offenders,
convicts of atrocious crimes, escaping, while the comparatively
young thief suffered death as the penalty of his earliest
essay.</p>

<p>The remainder of the afternoon was spent by the inmates of this
den in various pastimes, some gambling, some telling stories of
their old career, a few singing, and still fewer gloomily pacing
the common room. At length the hour arrived when they were to
separate for the night, and in divisions of three each they were
marshalled to their dormitories; these were cells, about twelve
feet by eight in size, provided with three rude bedsteads on each
of which was a mattress of straw and two rugs. The evening was
rapidly closing, and as they were unprovided with light, they lay
down at once, one of them remarking that it might be called going
to bed, but for his part he could see no bed to go to.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time since his sentence, Ralph had leisure to
consider his position; and the ideas that rapidly careered through
his brain almost drove him mad. At first he looked upon his fate as
certain; and a thousand thoughts of self-destruction urged
themselves upon him, each to be in turn dismissed or replaced by
another. At length it suggested itself to him that he was no more
sure to die than any of the rest, and should he be actually left
for execution, it would be time enough then to anticipate the
hangman. Anon the hope of breaking out of gaol crossed his mind,
and many schemes for doing so presented themselves to him. Hour
after hour pealed from a neighbouring clock, the iron tone jarring
upon his nerves with the impression that another of the perhaps few
subdivisions of time he had to live was now absorbed in the gulf of
eternity.</p>

<p>At length, towards morning, he sank into a sort of sleep, broken
by horrid dreams. Again the scene of the Court was enacted before
him; again the full, deep and bitter tones of the recorder dealt
forth the death doom upon the trembling convict. At once that
semblance passed away. He was again at play among the companions of
his youth.</p>

<p>Again the scene changed: the solemn pealing of a funeral bell
smote upon his very inmost soul. He <i>knew</i> it was the signal
for his own execution. The sad procession moved forth; the awful
service for the dead, in all its dread solemnity, reverberated in
his ears; he turned to gaze at the attendant clergyman. Horror of
horrors, the face he saw was that of a fiend. Suffering the most
excruciating torment, the criminal shuddered convulsively. But now
he had reached the scaffold. They ascended that fatal platform. A
sea of upturned human heads was visible; but they all appeared to
mock at and gibe the tortured sufferer with unearthly demoniacal
features. Another instant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The drop fell, and a
dreadfully agonizing feeling of strangulation supervened, so
intensely painful that Ralph awoke. Cold claws overspread his whole
body, and a strange numbness paralyzed his every limb. He lay for a
considerable time in a state of semi-somnolence, unable quite to
rouse himself, and yet dreading to relapse again into such painful
slumbers, though he could not still recall his senses sufficiently
to be certain that he had only dreamed.</p>

<p>At length a bustle in the stone-floored passage thoroughly
awakened him, and he jumped from his wretched pallet. In a few
minutes they were all reassembled in the day-room, and the company
of his fellows reassured the drooping spirits of our unhappy
prisoner.</p>

<p>The days of the session passed over. The total number of those
condemned to death amounted to sixty-five, all of whom met in the
same large room by day and were separated into threes at night. A
few days of dreary monotony passed over; but the nights were at
first most painful to Rashleigh, as more dreadful dreams harrowed
his soul. But at length he ceased to dream at all or even to think
about his future fate, all his ideas being engrossed by
contemplating schemes of escape.</p>

<p>Having ascertained that the sleeping-cell in which he spent his
nights was next to the outer wall of Newgate, he determined to try
to break through it, trusting to chance for what the exterior might
present. He now broached his scheme to his companions, one of whom
embraced it with avidity; but the other seemed to be sunk in
apathy. As the latter, however, engaged not to betray their
purpose, they determined on commencing operations that very night.
All the tools they possessed were two files given to our adventurer
on the day of his condemnation by Tyrrell, and a piece of iron
about two feet long, which had once formed part of the handle of a
frying-pan, and which was rather sharp at one end something like a
chisel.</p>

<p>With these implements they raked the mortar out of the joints of
the stonework, choosing a place beneath one of the beds as most
secluded from observation, carefully removing the lime dust, which
they carried out concealed on their persons every morning and
afterwards threw among the ashes in the fireplace. In three
nights&rsquo; time they had succeeded in loosening enough of the
stonework to enable them, by displacing the ashlar of which the
wall was built, to form an opening through the massy exterior
enclosure of the gaol; but they found a timber framing on the outer
side of the wall, which utterly bade defiance to all their efforts.
They had no remedy but to replace the stones as well as they could,
and wait for another night, by which time they doubted not to be
able to provide some substitute for a saw and a chisel, with which
to renew their attempt. Accordingly, next day they procured two
table-knives, which they notched on their edges. They then
sharpened the piece of iron on the hearthstone by stealth. These
implements, together with a phosphorus box &mdash; which they had
bribed a turnkey to bring them &mdash; and a piece of candle, they
very carefully stowed away about them, and returned to their cell,
resuming their labour as soon as all was still.</p>

<p>Having first removed the stonework, they procured a light and
examined the wooden partition. This seemed to be only a kind of
weatherboarding, such as is sometimes used to finish the gable-ends
of a roof in lieu of carrying up a brick wall. Their first business
was to make holes in the wood with their chisel and knives in four
different places, forming the angles of a square about two feet
across. The boards being only of deal, it was not long before they
had got their holes made. They then set to work to cut out the
pieces, in which they finally succeeded, taking great care that
nothing fell into the <i>Terra incognita</i> outside the wall. When
they had sped thus far, they looked through the opening and found
this space consisted of the apex of a roof, above the attics of the
adjoining houses. They now easily got through the aperture on to
the joists of these garrets, and had only next to remove the tiles,
when they should once more he enjoying the pure free air of
heaven.</p>

<p>Just as they began to work at the tiles with renewed vigour
Ralph&rsquo;s companion, happening unluckily to slip, stepped
suddenly off the piece of timber he was standing on and came with
his whole weight upon the laths of the plastered ceiling, which,
being old and decayed, gave way. The luckless wight was then
precipitated into the apartment beneath, where he chanced to alight
upon the bed of an ancient dame, who was servant to the reverend
chaplain of Newgate, under whose roof, it seems, our adventurers
had unwittingly penetrated. Dire were now the outcries of
&ldquo;Rape!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Robbery!&rdquo; that emanated from the old woman, who
refused to be pacified by the earnest entreaties of the intruder;
and in a very few seconds the hurried tramp of many feet, with the
noise of clamorous tongues, announced that the household was
alarmed. A moment after a promiscuous mass of half-clad beings
hurried into the attic, where, amid the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of
fallen plaster, laths, etc., the horror-stricken dame was venting
her objurgations upon the author of this mishap. He for his part,
the moment he saw the door open, bolted out of it and had got
half-way downstairs, pursued by hurried cries of &ldquo;Stop
him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Knock him down!&rdquo; etc., which burst from
the petrified group in the attic, when he encountered a posse of
the officers of Newgate, who had been aroused by the uproar which
truly seemed enough to awaken the seven sleepers &mdash; and who
had left the enjoyments of the porters&rsquo; lodge to ascertain
the cause of this confusion.</p>

<p>Unluckily, the foremost of these worthies well knew the escaped
one, and felled him on the staircase instanter. They then
separated, part of them returning to the lodge with their captive,
and part going upstairs into the room whence they now learned he
had run. Here, of course, the first thing they saw was the hole in
the ceiling, and a ladder being procured, some of them ascended it
to search the roof.</p>

<p>In the mean time Ralph Rashleigh, nerved by desperation, had
torn away the battens and tiles and blundered out through the
orifice; but in doing this he missed his hold and fell. He rolled
over and over on the tiled roof, utterly unable to stop himself and
full of despair at the horrible death which awaited him. At last,
with a bound, he was jerked from the roof and restored to sense by
finding himself immersed in water. He struck out to swim, and
presently received a violent blow on the head, but quickly
recovering himself, groped with his hands, it being so dark that he
could not set a yard before him, and catching hold of the parapet
wall, scrambled out, congratulating himself that his life was
spared as yet. Of course, he was perfectly ignorant where he was,
and knew not how far from the ground his present position might be.
The darkness also prevented his attempting to escape, lest he might
again fall from this unknown height. The only resource he had was
to sit still, astride the wall on which he was now seated, until
day should dawn. Wet through, the frosty air chilling him to the
quick, thus did Rashleigh spend the seemingly interminable hours,
until the light faintly glimmered from the east; and then he found
he was not in any very enviable position.</p>

<p>The wall on which he sat surrounded a small reservoir of water
that abutted from the back of the house, about half-way between the
top and bottom. There was no window or other opening near him by
many feet; and it was at least fifteen yards from his position to
the ground, which seemed to be a paved courtyard surrounded by
lofty buildings. Added to this, it was evident the daylight must
betray him on his &ldquo;bad eminence&rdquo;, as there was no means
of concealing himself save by jumping into the reservoir, which was
not quite full; and even then, he might be seen from the roof. Thus
he was quite as effectually confined as if he had been in the
strongest cell within the walls of Newgate. and he tantalised
himself by thinking of his recapture after having so narrowly
escaped a fearful death, that even a few inches of difference in
his fall must have resulted in his being dashed to atoms.</p>

<p>He was not very long in suspense. The day became rapidly
fighter, and in a few minutes a gruff voice from the roof hailed
him. &ldquo;Ha, my fine fellow! You&rsquo;re there, are you?
You&rsquo;re safe enough, anyhow, and we&rsquo;ve got your
<i>pal</i>, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh looked up and soon discovered one of the turnkeys
sitting at the foot of a stack of chimneys on the roof above him,
who appeared to be taking aim at him with a carbine. &ldquo;Hold
on!&rdquo; cried our &eacute;chapp&eacute;. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
shoot me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;if you sit still; but if you offer to stir, I&rsquo;ll let
fly and riddle you with bullets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was anything but a cheering prospect, and Ralph hardly
dared move hand or foot, until, a ladder being brought, he was fain
to descend it and was soon reconducted to prison.</p>

<p>Here he was placed in a dark cell by himself and kept on bread
and water for a week, at the end of which time the Governor of
Newgate ordered him to be very heavily ironed, and permitted him to
rejoin his companions. Here he found the partner of his late
attempt, and they had many a laugh together at their ill-starred
enterprise.</p>

<p>Day after day sped on over their heads. It was now the fourth
week after the sessions, and they expected every evening that the
report of the recorder, and the King&rsquo;s decision thereon,
would be made known to them. One afternoon in the fifth week they
had all been locked in their separate cells above an hour, when the
noise of several feet in the stone-floored passage attracted the
attention of the inmates of these dreary domiciles. Cell after cell
was heard to be unlocked, and finally, when the visitors drew nigh,
Rashleigh distinctly recognised the solemn voice of the prison
chaplain recommending some unfortunate to make the most of the few
brief hours yet allotted to him in this world by supplicating for
mercy from his God; and our convict was now aware his fate would
soon be made known to him. With agonising dread the few minutes
passed away, during which intervening cells were visited. At length
the sullen doors slowly revolved. The sheriffs in their official
dresses, the chaplain in his robes, and some others entered the
cell.</p>

<p>Rashleigh scarce heard the exordium which, as customary, was
addressed to them, but blessed heaven when one of the sheriffs,
with much solemnity. addressed another of the confines as follows:
&ldquo;William Roberts, your case has received His Majesty&rsquo;s
most gracious consideration; but your frequent previous
convictions, and the circumstances of peculiar atrocity with which
your last crime was accompanied utterly preclude the possibility of
mercy being extended to so hardened a criminal. You must therefore
prepare to expiate your offences on the scaffold: you are ordered
for execution in fourteen days from the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chaplain now addressed the condemned in anything but a
charitable or kindly tone, and impressed the necessity of prayer
and repentance upon his mind. The wretched man rolled his eyes,
which seemed dim and glassy, from one to the other of the
bystanders and attempted to speak, but ineffectually; his tongue
denied him utterance, and he was led away.</p>

<p>The same sheriff now addressed Ralph and his remaining
companion, saying that in the exercise of his royal prerogative of
mercy, His Majesty had graciously been pleased to spare their
lives; but to vindicate the insulted laws of their country they
must be transported for the residue of their existence to a distant
land, never more to revisit the isle of their birth.</p>

<p>The chaplain now told our criminals that they ought to fall
instantly upon their knees and return thanks to God for sparing
their unworthy lives. Rashleigh&rsquo;s companion here interrupted
the reverend orator by saying, &ldquo;If ever I pray to God, it
will only be that I may live to set you hanged, you prayer-mumbling
old beast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chaplain flung out of the cell in a rage, and the sheriffs
having followed him with suppressed smiles at this rude rebuff, the
convicts were once more left alone.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8" id="Chapter8"></a>Chapter

</h2>

<p class="note">Hark to the whistle and the shout!<br>
Like bloodhounds now they seek me out.<br>
I&rsquo;ll couch me here till evening gray,<br>
Then, darkling, try my dangerous way.</p>

<p>A few nights after the reception of the report by the unhappy
confines of Newgate, the cry of &ldquo;Lags away&rdquo; warned
those who were transported that the time had now arrived for their
removal to the hulk; and shortly afterwards those who like
Rashleigh had been respited from death, in number upwards of fifty,
were placed in two large vans, strongly ironed, handcuffed and
chained together, as well as to the van, which drove off at a rapid
rate. None knew which of the hulks they were destined for; but when
the morning came Ralph recognised some objects, by which he knew
they were on the road for Portsmouth; and accordingly, late on the
afternoon of the same day, they reached the dockyard of that town,
and shortly afterwards were permitted to alight on a wooden wharf,
outside of which lay the gloomy bulk of the old
<i>Leviathan</i>.</p>

<p>This vessel, an ancient 74, after having for many years borne
the victorious banner of Britain in every sea from pole to pole,
was at last condemned to the vile purpose of a convict hulk.
Stripped of all her imposing tackle save two sticks, now degraded
to the office of clothes props, with a singular sort of shed upon
her deck, the unfortunate craft looked like a sort of living
memento of the vicissitudes of all mundane matters and the
perishable nature of all earthly grandeur.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the newly arrived criminals were paraded upon
the quarterdeck of this old hooker, mustered, and received by the
captain of the hulk, after which the irons they had brought with
them were taken off and given back to the gaol authorities, who now
departed. The convicts in the mean time were all marched to the
forecastle and ushered into a washing-room, where each man was
obliged to strip, get into a large tub of water, and cleanse
himself thoroughly. Each then received a suit of coarse grey
clothing consisting of jacket, waistcoat and breeches. A very rough
twilled cotton shirt, striped with blue and white, a round-crowned
broad-brimmed felt hat, and a pair of heavily-nailed shoes
completed this unique costume; and when they had been divested of
their whiskers and got their hair closely cropped, the
metamorphosis was so complete that Rashleigh no longer knew any of
those who had arrived with him. Here, too, each man was
double-ironed with a pair of heavy fetters, and after this they
again emerged on deck, where a hammock and two blankets, with a
straw bed, were supplied every new prisoner, and they were now
ordered to go below.</p>

<p>They followed one of the guards down what seemed to them an
endless succession of step-ladders. When they reached the bottom, a
perfect chaos of sounds saluted their ears. The first glimpse of
the lower deck of this convict hulk showed a long passage bordered
by iron palisading, with lamps hung at regular intervals. Within
these rows of palisades were wooden partitions, which subdivided
the deck into upwards of a score of apartments. In each of these
about fifteen or twenty convicts slept and ate. As Ralph and his
associates in punishment marched past these dens, they were saluted
by obstreperous shouts of &ldquo;New chums! New chums!&rdquo; from
both sides; and at length Rashleigh and another were placed in one
of the cells, as they were called.</p>

<p>The first night our adventurer slept but little, the men who
were there before him playing all sorts of tricks upon the newly
arrived. At daybreak next morning he was awakened from a short doze
by a most villainous smell, that seemed to pervade the whole
atmosphere. Putting his head over the side of his hammock, he saw
his companions all busily discussing the contents of a wooden tub,
or <i>kid</i>, with their spoons, and from this tub the smell that
had so much shocked his sensitive olfactory organs appeared to
exhale. He was now hailed by his future messmates, who demanded to
know whether he did not intend to get up and have his
breakfast.</p>

<p>In truth, Ralph was hungry, so up he got and hurried on his
clothes. One of the men lent him a tin pot, which he filled at the
<i>kid</i>, and, spoon in hand, prepared to attack this unsavoury
mess.</p>

<p>Words must fail to describe the loathsome taste, even worse than
the villainous smell, of this abominable compound, which Rashleigh
declared he never could liken to anything earthly, and which he
never from first to last could taste. He afterwards found out this
food was composed of a very coarse kind of barley, similar to that
called Scotch or pearl barley, boiled up with the soup made from
the meat which was allowed to the convicts upon every alternate
day, this latter being designated <i>bull</i> &mdash; and if the
flesh of bulls be most indescribably tough, then did it well
deserve the sobriquet.</p>

<p>The dietary of the hulk, exclusive of meat and barley soup, was,
three days in each week, a portion of a mysterious
semi-petrifaction, very much akin to chalk both in taste and
durability. Nay, it was even much harder; but by the courtesy of
the contractors dubbed for the nonce cheese, it was indeed. as
Bloomfield described <i>Suffolk bang</i>, &ldquo;too big to swallow
and too hard to bite&rdquo;. It possessed most singular qualities,
its obduracy being proof against any mollifying influence arising
from cookery of any sort. As it was perfectly uninflammable, it
might have made most excellent fire-bricks. Nay, it could not be in
any degree softened by boiling, so that by far the greater portion
of it was thrown overboard every day, as the captain&rsquo;s pigs
were too haughty to touch any portion of this <i>excellent
relish</i>.</p>

<p>For breakfast and supper, when meat was not allowed, each man
received a pint of the barley before named, plain boiled in water;
and lucky was the wight who could muster a small quantity of salt
to season it. Besides the above articles, a pound of very black
unpalatable bread formed the daily allowance of each man, with a
pint of very had vinegar, here dignified with the name of table
beer.</p>

<p>The whole of the convicts, save those employed on board in
cleaning the hulk, cooking, and attending on the officers, were
sent every morning to labour in the dockyard, where they were
employed in large parties, most appropriately designated
<i>gangs</i>, at various works. Ralph was placed in a timber gang,
and was quickly yoked to a large truck with twenty others, each man
having a broad hempen band or collar put over one shoulder and
beneath the other arm, so that in pulling, his weight pressed
against it across his breast. Each gang was under the orders of a
veteran sailor of the Royal Navy, some of whom were glad to repay
upon the wretched convicts the tyranny with which they had been
treated by their officers in former times, while others were more
occupied in screwing out money from those under their charge, to
enable them to pay frequent visits to the <i>tap</i>, where they
solaced themselves with repeated libations of <i>heavy</i>
<i>wet</i>.</p>

<p>Rashleigh&rsquo;s ganger, or overseer, was of the first class.
He assumed a the self-important airs which he perhaps thought
became the quarter-deck of a man-of-war, and many a poor wretch was
crippled under him; for being utterly ignorant of any proper mode
of working among timber, he would frequently compel his gang to
proceed so awkwardly that immense pieces of timber would fall from
skids or other elevations and smash a leg or two, when the
sufferers were carried off to the hospital ship, where they either
lived or died as best pleased the naval surgeon who swayed the
destinies of that receptacle, and who frequently was heard to say
&ldquo;that he must set to and dock (amputate) a dozen or two of
those fellows, for he was getting most awfully out of
practice&rdquo;. Truly the latter was very strange, for scarcely a
week passed without some poor devil being minus a leg or an arm
through his case of instruments.</p>

<p>Rashleigh, who had never before worked at any species of manual
labour, was quickly termed a skulker, and was obliged to endure a
double share of the oppression of his overseer on this account. The
misery of his abode, he being thus overwrought and rather more than
half starved all day, and being devoured by myriads of vermin all
night, made Ralph long for the arrival of the vessel which was to
remove him to New South Wales; but that period was yet distant, as
but a few days before his arrival, a draft had sailed from
Portsmouth, and another was not to be dispatched for three months
thereafter.</p>

<p>In the mean time he was taken sick; and though the doctor was of
opinion he was only shamming, he was placed on board the hospital
ship. By means of powerful purgatives, bleeding and blistering.
that skilful <i>medico</i> quickly brought his patient to
death&rsquo;s door; but after a few weeks&rsquo; illness, nature
reasserted her sovereignty, and as Ralph carefully avoided taking
any of the medicine lately provided for him, which he cunningly
contrived instead to throw into the urinal, he rapidly recovered,
in spite of medical art, when he was removed to the convalescent
wards.</p>

<p>One day three of the patients died, and as deceased convicts
were then usually buried in a graveyard near a number of ruined
buildings on the Gosport side which were among the prisoners called
&ldquo;Rats&rsquo; Castle&rdquo;, some of the convalescent
patients, of whom Rashleigh was one, were selected to go there and
dig the graves. Accordingly, over the water they went, under the
care of one of the old sailors before referred to, in a boat manned
by convicts.</p>

<p>The soil was very light, and their task an easy one. When it was
done the guard made a signal by waving a handkerchief upon a stick.
While they were awaiting the return of their boat &mdash; which had
on their arrival been dispatched for the coffins &mdash; Rashleigh
and Ins companions lay or sat, as best suited them, among the
nameless, shapeless grassy mounds which filled the convicts&rsquo;
graveyard, each marking the narrow resting-place of one who had
died degraded, forgotten and unknown, his last moments uncheered by
the voice of affection or the soothing sympathies of kindred, and
whose remains were scarcely cold ere he was hurried into the rude
shell, hustled off in the boat, amid jokes or oaths, as the
prevailing mood of the boatmen might be, and finally thrust into
the ground, without a prayer, scarcely six inches below the surface
of the earth,</p>

<p>These and many other melancholy thoughts passed rapidly through
the mind of our adventurer, and after a time he looked up to see
whether the boat was returning; but it had not yet left the side of
the hospital ship. He gazed round on his companions, most of whom
slept; the guard was at some distance, with his back turned. A
thought of freedom darted into his brain; it was adopted with the
speed of light. Not ten yards from him were the ruins; if he could
reach them he would be screened from observation &mdash; and close
to the ruins was the water. His irons had been struck from one of
his legs while he was sick, so that all his chains were attached to
the other side only. and he doubted not but he could easily swim or
dive unimpeded by them. The weather was warm, and if he could gain
about a mile higher up, there was a wood of osiers, in which he
might conceal himself until he could take off his cumbrous
appendages.</p>

<p>Before he had done thinking about it, he was at the edge of the
water, among the ruins, had thrown off all his clothing except his
nether garments, and now slipped down into the stream, swimming
very softly. When he had attained depth enough, he trod water until
he got round a projecting point which formed the boundary of the
graveyard. Beyond this point there were many bulrushes, which
served to shelter him; nor did he hear any alarm given. Having by
dint of swimming, wading, and treading water, at, last reached the
osiers unobserved, he found a small creek, up which he swam, and
coming in a thickly wooded spot, he scrambled through the mud,
until he gained a piece of land hard enough to bear his weight.
Here he began to think what should be his next step.</p>

<p>It was imperatively necessary he should get rid of his chain,
and forturiately finding he was much wasted through his sickness,
he persevered in his struggles until at last he slipped it down
over his ankle. He now threw both it and his remaining garment into
deep water. The evening was very chilly, and he was fain to betake
himself again to the stream, as he found that much warmer than the
land. He next crossed the river again, and upon landing made
towards a pile of buildings he saw standing at a short distance
from the shore. These proved to be cattle sheds; but there were no
human dwellings near and Ralph hardly knew what to do. At last he
decided upon remaining where he was until the cattle tender should
come, who might be induced by some pitiful tale to help him to a
few rags, as decency forbade his going much about in his present
utter nakedness.</p>

<p>Accordingly, our shivering adventurer prowled among some stalls
on one side of the square formed by these buildings, and was at
last lucky enough to find some litter, which had apparently been
used only sufficiently to make it warm. Having successfully
disputed possession of this treasure with an old cow, he crept in
among it, heaping it over and around him, and finding himself very
warm and comfortable, quickly went to sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, it was hardly daylight; but a boy was turning out
the cattle. Ralph called most lustily to him for some time before
the youngster heard. This youth gaped with astonishment at the tale
Rashleigh told, that he was a poor sailor who, having got drunk,
had lain down by the water-side, where some wretches had stripped
him naked. He begged the lad, for God&rsquo;s sake, to procure him
any sort of old things that might cover him until he could get into
Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The boy seemed a good deal moved by the recital, and promised he
would go up to his master&rsquo;s house, to try whether he could
get anything for him to wear. In less than ar hour he returned,
bringing a blue smock frock, checked shirt, waggoner&rsquo;s hat,
pair of cord breeches, and high-low shoes, all very old, but still
whole and tolerably clean, saying, at the same time, if Ralph would
go up to the house, he might get &ldquo;zummat t&rsquo; yeat, if he
wor an &lsquo;ongry&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Rashleigh took the clothes most thankfully and asked the way to
the house, telling the lad he would first go and wash himself in
the river and then follow him. Having received directions, he once
more thanked the boy, who departed with a speed that indicated he
was &ldquo;an &lsquo;ongry&rdquo;, if Ralph was not.</p>

<p>Our adventurer, after having cleansed his person in the river
from the impurities of his last night&rsquo;s lodgings, now clad
himself in this unwonted guise. He then debated within himself
whether it might not he dangerous to accept the hospitable
invitation of the cow-boy, and finally resolved not to linger in
such a perilous neighbourhood; so he set forth at a brisk pace
along the stream, keeping his back to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>After walking upwards of a mile, he heard a female voice hailing
loudly, &ldquo;Whoi, Tummas! Tummas, I zay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As his name was not &ldquo;Tummas&rdquo;, and he was not
thinking of anything except making the best of his way, he did not
stop, until the voice, now close behind him, roared out, &ldquo;Dam
thee! Stop, I zay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He suddenly turned round and confronted the speaker, who was a
pretty-looking country girl, about seventeen or eighteen years of
age, and who had plainly lost what little breath the run had left
her with astonishment at finding out she had overtaken a
stranger.</p>

<p>The damsel opened both her mouth and eyes to the utmost of their
capacity and stammered out, &ldquo;Whoi, it bean&rsquo;t Tummas,
arter all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not Thomas, my pretty dear,&rdquo; said
Rashleigh; &ldquo;but I would be just as willing to do anything to
oblige you as ever he could be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drat it,&rdquo; continued the maiden. &ldquo;<i>That</i>
be&rsquo;s so loike our Tummas&rsquo;s slop! Whoi, I could
a&rsquo;most ha&rsquo; sworn to it, b&rsquo; the patch on the
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And very likely,&rdquo; quoth Rashleigh, &ldquo;it was
your Thomas&rsquo;s slop; for it was given to me not far away when
I&rsquo;d been robbed of all my own clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, robbed of your Clothes, all on &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
responded the girl in amazement. &ldquo;And did &rsquo;em leave you
quite naked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did so,&rdquo; replied Ralph, &ldquo;and I have got
a very long way to go, without a penny to help
myself.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said the kind-hearted girl. If
thee&rsquo;ll come back again a bit, M mother&rsquo;ll give thee
zummat t&rsquo; yeat, I do know, at any rate, and thee&rsquo;ll be
my the better of that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh willingly accompanied his guide to her lowly home,
where a hearty laugh ensued between the girl and her mother at the
mistake made by the former; and his misfortune being related, the
old dame bestowed her warm sympathy, and a substantial breakfast of
bread, bacon and small beer to the traveller, who shortly after
took his leave, much refreshed and very thankful for the kind
hospitality he had so very unexpectedly received.</p>

<p>He then travelled in the direction of Winchester. Upon Portsdown
Heath he overtook a pedlar, who, in addition to his pack, had a
very heavy bundle to carry. This man entered into conversation with
our adventurer, who feigned a country dialect in his speech as much
as possible, and learning that they were likely to travel some
short distance together, the dealer offered Ralph a shilling if he
would carry the bundle for him during the rest of the day.
Rashleigh willingly complied with this offer, and they journeyed on
till evening was drawing near, when they reached a village inn, at
which the pedlar declared his intention of stopping for the night.
Having given to our adventurer the sum agreed on, the latter also
went in for the purpose of obtaining some bread and cheese, with a
draught of beer, for supper.</p>

<p>The room he entered was full of various sorts of people, who
took small notice of him. Having discussed his food, he was sitting
in a corner, when in marched a party of soldiers, who stopped both
the doors, while the sergeant who led them began to look most
narrowly into the faces of every person present.</p>

<p>Rashleigh had taken off his hat, and the man of scarlet favoured
him with a gaze of more attentive scrutiny than he seemed to bestow
upon the rest. At last the sergeant asked our hero&rsquo;s
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Harper,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; was the next query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A labouring man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from now?&rdquo; demanded the
&ldquo;non-cornmissioned&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Havant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do your&rdquo; said the son of Mars. &ldquo;When were
you there last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A week ago,&rdquo; replied Rashleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! A week ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And where have you been
to since?&rdquo; demanded the martialist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, at Portsmouth, if you must know,&rdquo; responded
Rashleigh, beginning to lose his temper at the pertinacity of the
querist, who now drew his sword saying, &ldquo;Yes. At Portsmouth.
I knew that; and you &lsquo;listed there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me &lsquo;listed?&rdquo; said Ralph. &ldquo;Not I,
indeed, my good fellow.&rdquo; Rashleigh, in the excitement of the
moment, had thrown off his country accent and spoke with his
natural idiom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; cried the sergeant. &ldquo;Does anybody think
this chap comes from <i>Havant</i> now, with such a tongue as
that?</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, my fine starter,&rdquo; resumed the man of war,
&ldquo;you never <i>come</i> from Havant; and now I&rsquo;ve got
you, I&rsquo;ll take care you don&rsquo;t go there neither in a
hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he gave a sign to two of his comrades, who advanced
upon Ralph and quickly secured him with a pair of handcuffs, after
which the sergeant ordered the whole party outside. Presently they
were ordered to take possession of a loft above a stable, where the
military shortly afterwards had their suppers brought to them. This
over, an additional pair of handcuffs being provided, they were
placed one on each of Rashleigh&rsquo;s wrists. He being in this
way secured between two soldiers that were fettered to him by one
hand apiece, they lay down in this manner to rest. it was evident
that he had been taken up, not as a runaway convict, but as a
deserter; and he conceived he would soon be liberated, as it must
quickly be discovered to be a mistake. He therefore felt little
anxiety for the result, and resigned himself to sleep as well as he
could under such very uncomfortable circumstances.</p>

<p>At a very early hour of the next morning the party were aroused
by their commander, and having partaken of a humble breakfast,
began their march to Portsmouth. After journeying some time in
silence, the sergeant came to the side of Ralph and with a jeering
manner asked him whether he didn&rsquo;t think he was a fool for
trying to impose upon an old soldier like the sergeant &mdash; as
if he were a raw recruit &mdash; by striving to pass himself off
for a countryman. Ralph only replied that they would soon find out
their mistake, to which the other rejoined with a laugh,
&ldquo;Why, then, I suppose you are some King&rsquo;s son in
disguise; but no matter. The next time you desart from the army,
I&rsquo;d advise you to buy yourself a wig, for anybody could tell
you had been a soldier by the way your hair is cut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph now found out that the sergeant had been induced to
believe him a deserter and to question him by this very
circumstance, so that if he had only kept his hat on, it is
probable he might have escaped the arrest of this vigilant
commander. Being doubly vexed on this account by the annoyance of
the sergeant&rsquo;s sarcasms, he retorted that he was no deserter,
that he had never enlisted in his life, because he always thought
the life of a dog far better than that of a soldier, and for his
own part, had rather turn a nightman than enlist. The son of Mars
flew into a rage at this highly insulting speech, and threatened to
knock his teeth down his throat if he did not hold his tongue; and
for the remainder of the journey the sergeant and escort put every
species of annoyance in practice towards their prisoner.</p>

<p>At length the weary march was ended, and they reached the
&ldquo;lines&rdquo; of Portsmouth, inside of which was a
guard-room, where they deposited their prisoner. Here he passed the
night, and the next day was removed to Gosport Barracks, where it
was quickly found out he was not the person whom the party had been
dispatched in quest of; and Ralph had the great satisfaction of
hearing the sergeant soundly rated for his stupidity in making such
a mistake.</p>

<p>He was now set at liberty; but just as he was about to leave the
barrack yard, he saw this same petty officer who had taken him in
custody, and could not resist the opportunity of repaying him in
abuse for the oppression he had endured in the journey under his
command. The sergeant roared out for the guard and gave our
adventurer in charge for abusing him while on duty, and in a little
while the luckless Rashleigh was again handcuffed and marched off
to the watch-house, from whence he was taken in the evening before
the Mayor of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Upon being interrogated as to his name, place of abode, etc.,
Ralph said it was Jenkins and that he was a clerk out of employment
who had come to Portsmouth a few days before; but having been
robbed of his clothing on his return to London, he had been obliged
to beg the articles he then wore. The clerk to the bench eyed him
during this narrative with much distrust, and leaning over,
whispered to the Mayor, who nodded with profound gravity. The
sergeant was called on to state his complaint, which he did with a
volubility of tongue that did not confine itself to the truth, but
wound up by stating that the prisoner had threatened to take his
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; said the magisterial Solon. &ldquo;A
werry pretty feller, to abuse the honourable profession of a
soldier, who spends his life fighting for his King and country,
while such rapscallions as himself are skulking about, looking out
for chances to rob their neighbours&rsquo; hen-roosts! What have
you to say for yourself, you blackguard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this highly <i>temperate</i> and very becoming speech,
Rashleigh only replied that the sergeant had much exaggerated the
truth, for that he (the prisoner) had not threatened the other at
all, but only reproached him for his harsh treatment to himself
while a prisoner under his charge.</p>

<p>Two or three non-commissioned officers now stepped forth, each
anxious to be heard first, and all offering to swear to the truth
of the sergeant&rsquo;s statement; which of course they could very
well do, as having been in Court all the time, not a word of what
he had said had escaped them. The Mayor, however, declined to give
them so much trouble, and after a short conference with his clerk,
he again addressed the prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my fine feller, you might think to impose upon this
&rsquo;ere Court with that there fine story of yourn; but I can
tell you as how you shan&rsquo;t; for I&rsquo;m resolved, if I
can&rsquo;t do anything else, to send you to gaol for a month as a
rogue and a <i>wagabond</i> what can&rsquo;t give no proper account
of himself, not by no manner of means. But then I thinks as how you
are a suspicious feller besides, and I makes no manners of doubt
but we shall have a hue and cry arter you in a werry little while
for some willainous <i>despredation</i> or other; so I&rsquo;ll
remand you for a week, that our <i>wigilant perleece</i> may have
time to make enquiries about you. Take him away.&rdquo; And away
Rashleigh was taken accordingly.</p>

<p>He had not been removed from the office, before he saw one of
the guards of the hulk <i>Leviathan</i>, who, it seemed, had come
there to report the escape of another convict from the dockyard
that day. This person was possessed of the lynx-eyed sagacity
proper for his calling, and he no sooner saw our hero than he went
close up to him, and removing the waggoner&rsquo;s hat worn by the
luckless runaway, cried out, &ldquo;Aha, my gentleman! You&rsquo;re
nabbed, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The constable who had Rashleigh in charge eagerly enquired if
the guard knew his prisoner, and he being answered in the
affirmative, the unfortunate Ralph was again placed before
&ldquo;His Worship&rdquo;, to whom the tale was soon related of his
being an escaped convict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said that functionary in great exultation.
&ldquo;I knew he was a dangerous <i>willain</i>. I am worry seldom
deceived in my opinions about sitch ruffians. But as you say
he&rsquo;s already transported for life, I don&rsquo;t see as how
we can add anything to his sentence. I suppose the best thing we
can do is to send him back to the hulk at once, and let the captain
punish him for running away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments Ralph was hurried to the boat which had brought
the officer on shore. Strongly chained and handcuffed, with the
muzzle of a pistol held close to his head, he was rapidly
reconveyed to his former gloomy place of abode.</p>

<p>Having been brought on board, he was ushered down to the
&ldquo;black hole&rdquo;, as it was called &mdash; a dungeon in the
ship&rsquo;s eyes below the water-level, and there left to his
solitary reflections, which, however, could scarcely he termed so,
inasmuch as many myriads of rats inhabited this den, which leaped,
ran and gambolled about, over and around their human companion.</p>

<p>The tedious hours of night wore away. The day had begun some
time, as the noise of the men trampling to and fro on the different
decks indicated. These sounds ceased: all the convicts had gone to
work. For some hours more Ralph still remained unvisited; but at
length he heard a footstep approaching. His prison was opened and
he was ordered to follow the guard, who preceded him to the
quarter-deck. Here stood the captain, his mates, the surgeon and
other officers of the hulk, in their full naval uniforms. The
prisoner was placed on a certain spot indicated by a sign from the
commander, and the tale of his escape, having been succinctly
related by the guard in whose charge he had been sent to dig the
graves, was followed by a recital of his recapture from the officer
who had brought him from the shore. He was asked what he had to
say, and having only the natural love of liberty inherent in the
breast of all men to urge, he was sentenced to receive ten dozen
lashes in presence of all the convicts that same day.</p>

<p>He was now again conducted to the black hole, and a little
before sunset he was once more led to the quarter-deck, having now
to pass through the lines of his fellow-prisoners, ranged there to
witness his degrading punishment. His offence and sentence having
been related aloud, he was commanded to strip and was quickly
secured to the gratings, which had been lashed to the bulwarks. A
brawny boatswain&rsquo;s mate now commenced the infliction of the
agonising torture.</p>

<p>Rashleigh had long before been assured by persons who had
suffered it, that shrieking out only added to the pain, which
became less the quieter and more immovable the sufferer kept
himself. When he was being tied up he had crammed his shirt into
his mouth in such a way that it was jammed between his face and the
grating; so that he could not get it out until he was released.
Thus, during the whole time, he could breathe only through his
nostrils, and though the pain was most harrowingly intense &mdash;
for he long afterwards declared it could only be likened to the
sensation of having furrows torn in your flesh with jagged wire,
and ore they closed filled up with burning molten lead running in
streams of fire down your back &mdash; yet he could not at first
cry out. By the time be had received four of the dozens, at each of
which a fresh instrument and a fresh operator were applied, the
whole of his body had been entirely numbed, and he only felt as if
his lacerated flesh were receiving heavy blows from some huge
club.</p>

<p>The punishment lasted more than an hour, at the end of which
time he was released from the grating and fell insensible on the
deck, whence he was carried to the hospital ship, where he was
quickly resuscitated, with a vengeance, by the application of a
dressing which was applied to his back, and which, he was
subsequently assured, was composed chiefly of <i>pepper and
salt</i>!!! &mdash; in compliance with the usual <i>mild</i> and
<i>merciful</i> system pursued by the naval and military surgeons
of that day; and the excruciating torment occasioned by this
<i>remedy</i> completely mocked the horrors of the actual suffering
of the lash. So often as this dressing was removed and replaced by
a new one &mdash; which was done every day for nearly a month
&mdash; the sufferings of the wretched patient made him roar aloud
with their intensity; which could only have been equalled by the
torture inflicted on the unfortunate cacique Atabalipa, when
stretched upon his bed of fire by the monster Hernan Cortes.</p>

<p>Under even this discipline, however, Rashleigh slowly recovered,
and became convalescent just in time to go in a draft that was
ordered to proceed to New South Wales by the good ship
<i>Magnet</i> of London, Captain, James Boltrope.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9" id="Chapter9"></a>Chapter
9</b>
</h2>

<p align="center" class="note">Onward she goes, over ripple and
spray,<br>
Over the waters &mdash; away &mdash; and away.</p>

<p>It was in the evening when, according to the custom of the hulk,
the names of all those who were destined to depart were called
aloud on each deck by the boatswain, and they were directed to
prepare for the &ldquo;Bay ship&rdquo; on the morrow. Our hero was
doubly rejoiced at hearing his own name among the rest, for since
the torturing disgraceful punishment he had received, the
<i>Leviathan</i> had become perfectly hateful to him, and he spent
the whole of the night in rumination as to his probable fortune in
Australia.</p>

<p>The next day the convicts were duly washed, shaved, cropped, and
supplied with two suits each of new slop clothing. They were all
ironed too afresh, having each a new pair of double irons put on,
and were then paraded before the surgeon superintendent of the
vessel in which they were to sail. This officer rejected a few of
those who appeared sickly, and others were called in their room.
Shortly afterwards the whole body was transferred to a large
lighter, which conveyed them out to Spithead, where the good ship
fraught with their destinies lay like a mighty sea-bird asleep on
the bosom of the open roadstead. On being placed on board, the
prisoners were mustered down below, between the decks, into their
proper sleeping-places, where each found a numbered bed and
blanket. They were then left to pass the night as they listed.</p>

<p>The ship <i>Magnet</i>, which was to convey our adventurer and
his companions to the Antipodes, was of about 500 tons burden. The
chief part of the maindeck was appropriated to the use of the
convicts, of whom there were 150 originally embarked. The deck had
been subdivided by a strong bulkhead into two apartments, the
smaller by far of which was destined to the reception of the boy
convicts, of whom there were about thirty. The hatchways were
secured with upright elm stanchions in a stout framing, the whole
rendered impervious to any attempt at cutting them by having
innumerable broadheaded nails driven home as close together as
possible into every portion of the stanchions and frame that was
exposed to view. In one of these hatchways were the doors leading
to the men&rsquo;s and the boys&rsquo; prisons. These openings were
purposely made so small that only one person at a time could pass
through them, and a military sentry was posted day and night in the
hatchway to prevent any mutiny or other irregularity.</p>

<p>The military guard consisted of two commissioned and six
non-commissioned officers, with about forty private soldiers, some
of whom wore married and accompanied by their wives and families.
While at Spithead, the prisoners were only allowed to come on deck
in divisions, three-fourths remaining below while the others
enjoyed the fresh air, six soldiers being posted at different parts
of the ship. When they sailed, however, the convicts were allowed
the liberty of the deck, the whole body except the sick being
obliged to leave the prison every fine day by sunrise, and taking
their meals on the deck, returning to their berths only at sunset,
when they were mustered down by an officer.</p>

<p>Order was maintained among them, and a due regard to cleanliness
enforced, by a boatswain and six mates, selected by the surgeon
superintendent from the convicts, of whom he had the exclusive
care. Their food consisted of the ration which was commonly known
in the transport service by the name of &ldquo;six upon
four&rdquo;, it being four men-of-war sailors&rsquo; allowance
among six of the prisoners. When the voyage advanced, a small
portion of wine or lime-juice was issued on alternate days. There
was, in fact, no lack of anything felt on board save water, which
was necessarily carefully husbanded, and the want of which was
chiefly endured by those who devoured their salt provisions too
greedily.</p>

<p>The day after the arrival of the draft, a boatswain, two cooks
and other petty officers were chosen from among them, and the men
distributed into messes or parties of eight in each, who were to
receive their stated allowance of food and water together. It being
known that nearly a fortnight would elapse before they sailed for
their destination, many of the convicts busied themselves by
writing to their friends or relatives to bid them farewell or to
request a parting visit. As for Rashleigh, he had resolved not to
let any person know his fate, and as his name was an assumed one,
he conceived none of his connexions were aware of his
degradation.</p>

<p>Bumboats with all manner of supplies attended the <i>Magnet</i>
at her moorings daily; and as the time for their departure drew
nigh, the deck frequently presented an animating and lively
appearance, sorrowfully diversified at times by groups of weeping
females or children assembled round some parent or brother who was
about to be severed from them, most probably for ever.</p>

<p>Ralph had little to do with either leave-taking or bargaining.
His slender store of money was soon expended in purchasing a little
tea and sugar, with a few other trifling comforts, for his long
voyage; and it was with no very poignant feelings of regret that he
saw the anchor weighed and the sails loosed which were to waft him
away from the land of his birth.</p>

<p>The vessel passed near the Isle of Wight, and standing out into
mid channel, they continued their course until evening, when all
were ordered below. The sleeping-berths between decks were framed
of deal boards, supported by stanchions and quartering of the same
kind of timber, and subdivided into compartments in which six men
slept in a space of about as many feet. These bed-places were
framed in rows along each side of the ship, and a double row was
also formed in the centre, between which and the sides and
hatchways, narrow passages were left.</p>

<p>This being their first night at sea, the broken waves of the
channel tossed them about considerably, and the wind being aft, the
vessel rolled much more than was agreeable to such raw sailors. A
scene of great confusion was therefore the result, some swearing,
some casting up their accounts, a very, very few indeed praying,
and many lying without daring to stir. Rashleigh was not much
affected by the motion, and when the tumult had a little subsided,
he went to sleep; though, as he lay athwart the vessel, his rest
was much disturbed by the rolling. Towards midnight he awoke and
made the discovery that his feet were elevated about a yard higher
than his head, an order of things which, as he had not been
accustomed to it, he forthwith proceeded to alter. But scarce had
he done so when he found himself subject to the same inconvenience
in his fresh position, so that he was fain to replace his head
against the ship&rsquo;s side, as he had at first lain down, being
fearful, while he lay the other way, that some roll more violent
than the rest might suddenly dislodge him and cast him headlong
into the opposite sleeping-berths: a mode of visiting his shipmates
which he could very well dispense with.</p>

<p>He could not sleep more, however, in any position, so he sat up
at last, leaning against the ship&rsquo;s side and ever and anon
wondering what it was that continually struck the bows of the
vessel &mdash; as it seemed to him &mdash; with such tremendous
fury, little thinking it was the waves, every time her head went
down to meet them.</p>

<p>At length he heard a dreadful crash above, followed by the
hurtling fall of timbers on the deck. At the same moment a
tremendous sea broke over the bulwarks of the vessel and swept with
fury down into the main hatchway, in which the sentry was posted.
The violence of the rushing water drove the poor soldier with great
force against the barricade, and a perfect deluge poured into the
prison.</p>

<p>Dire was now the clamour. A hundred sleepers were aroused at
once, to find themselves and their bedding immersed in water which
every fresh roll of the vessel dashed from side to side, as it had
no outlet. Most of them, in a state of mortal terror, deemed the
ship was sinking, and a wild outcry of lamentation pealed from many
tongues.</p>

<p>Very soon a few of the boldest rushed at the little gateway,
hoping to force it and gain the deck, that they might not, as one
of their number expressed it, &ldquo;be drowned like rats, shut up
in a cage&rdquo;; but the wicket bade defiance to all their
ill-directed strength. Meanwhile the tones of the sentry might
sometimes be heard above the din of voices or the rush of the
mighty waters, pouring forth a jeremiad in terms like the
following: &ldquo;Wirrah, it&rsquo;s murdered, and kilt, losht,
destroyed and drownded I am! Swate mother o&rsquo; Jasus! And my
firelock gone. Shure, if I escape this turn, I&rsquo;ll be hanged
tomorrow for losing my arrums. Och, Wirrah! Wirrah!&rdquo; And in
the darkness the poor fellow would grope for his lost musket, when
suddenly a roll of the ship would throw him forcibly against one of
the sides, until, a lighted lantern being brought, his dilemma was
observed and another sentry placed on his post.</p>

<p>The prisoners, however, were compelled to pass the night in the
best manner they could, only being assured that there was no
danger, the noise and confusion on deck having arisen from one of
the yards giving way. They set to work and bailed the water into
the privies as well as they could, and by morning everything was
once more quiet below.</p>

<p>Nothing of moment now passed for some time. The good ship still
gallantly breasted the billows on her watery way, and at last they
neared the Equinoctial, where the ceremony of shaving, on crossing
the line, was productive of much fun, about fifty of the prisoners
undergoing that operation for the merriment of the others, who,
with the captain, officers and passengers, were all equally amused
thereby.</p>

<p>Some time prior to this event Ralph Rashleigh had been selected
by the surgeon to act as his clerk, a circumstance which, while it
procured him many comforts, also probably prevented his having any
hand in a scheme that was now set on foot among the prisoners for
seizing the vessel, which was shortly after their crossing the line
brought to maturity, and but very narrowly defeated.</p>

<p>The boys&rsquo; prison was separated only by a bulkhead on
either side from the portion occupied by the military and the older
prisoners, with relation to which it occupied the centre. Some of
these adroit young thieves had contrived to loosen a board in the
bulkhead between their own and the soldiers&rsquo; apartment.
Through this aperture one of the smallest among them used to get
into the berth of the military when the latter were asleep, and
steal tea, sugar, tobacco, biscuits, or in short, anything he could
lay his hands on. This became known to some of the men, who
concocted a plot, in which they were joined by others, that this
boy should on a certain night steal three muskets which stood in an
open arm rack in the soldiers&rsquo; berth, and which were visible
from the deck and were supposed to be kept continually loaded.
These muskets were to be passed from the boys&rsquo; into the
men&rsquo;s prison, and in the morning, when the convicts were let
up to wash the deck, some of those who were first up were to go to
the fore hatchway, and the stolen fire-arms were then to be handed
to them from the prison. The rest of the convicts on deck were to
be very active in throwing water about and bustling to and fro, so
as to attract the notice of the sentries there, of whom there would
be three, one at the forecastle, one at the waist, and the third on
the poop, of whom only the last would have fire-arms with him. The
two sentries forward, being surprised by men from behind them, were
to be seized and thrown overboard, while the one on the poop was to
be shot dead at the same signal. One party was then to cast loose
the breeching of a cannon on the deck, which was known to be
loaded, and run it to the companion ladder leading down to the
soldiers&rsquo; berth, while in the mean time another party was to
rush aft and secure the officers.</p>

<p>All this, to a certain extent, fell out exactly as the mutineers
had anticipated. The sentries forward were seized, and one of the
prisoners snapped his piece at the soldier on the poop; but it did
not go off. The other two muskets were then tried with as little
success-in fact, there was no priming in either. In the mean time
the sentry on the poop roared out &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; But a rush
being made upon him, he fired his piece at random and the instant
afterwards was thrown overboard. The party who should have cast
loose the cannon found that the stubbornness of the fastenings bade
defiance to all their efforts of loosening them by hand, and not
one of them possessed a knife.</p>

<p>The soldiers now came pouring up the ladder. The first two or
three were tumbled back on their companions by blows from the
stocks of the mutineers&rsquo; muskets, until two of the military
officers, who had leaped through the cabin skylight on finding
themselves attacked, and who had now gained the poop with their
fowling-pieces, levelled them and shot two of the boldest among the
convicts dead alongside the ladder. Their companions recoiled. The
soldiers now rushed upon deck. A volley of musketry was poured in
among the prisoners, of whom five fell, three jumped overboard and
all the rest were driven below, many being wounded severely by the
bayonets of the exasperated guard. All that day they were kept
below without food, and the next morning, the prison doors being
thrown open, they were ordered to come on deck.</p>

<p>When Rashleigh did so, he found the whole of the military under
arms, one line being drawn across the poop, and another line across
the forecastle. Two guns had also been lashed in front of both
parties, beside which stood a seaman with a lighted match, the
muzzle of each cannon being pointed inwards towards the main
hatchway, around which the convicts were huddled in a group. When
all the latter had come up the ladder, the ship&rsquo;s boatswain
ordered them to answer their names and go on the quarter-deck as
they were called. They did so; and when our adventurer&rsquo;s turn
came, he followed his predecessor into the presence of the surgeon,
ship&rsquo;s captain and military officers, who, dressed in full
uniform, occupied the front of the poop stairs. The only sentry who
remained alive out of the three that had been on guard the previous
morning, and who had fortunately escaped by clinging to a rope that
was towing overboard, stood near his officers, his business
apparently being to identify the men who had been on deck during
the attempt. Each prisoner was also stripped to ascertain if he had
been wounded. If no wound appeared, and the sentry could not say
that he had been concerned in the mutiny, he was then asked whether
he knew anything of the attempted seizure, and informed that if he
would give accurate intelligence respecting the authors of the plot
he should be highly rewarded instanter, and strongly recommended
for his liberty at the expiration of the voyage.</p>

<p>Rashleigh had always loved his bed too well to be an early
riser. He had never been on deck any day since they left the land
until he was compelled, and his being employed by the surgeon
probably precluded any confidence being placed in him by his
fellows; so after he had declared his ignorance he was dismissed.
The affair ended by about twenty of the prisoners either being
identified by the soldier, or being shown to have been wounded.
These were now severely flogged and placed in heavy irons until the
vessel should reach Port Jackson, being confined all the time
besides in a sort of den under the forecastle. Although many of the
convicts afterwards professed to give details of the plot and the
names of the chief actors in it, nearly all the tales were found to
be mere fabrications, and it was generally believed that the
leaders in this abortive mutiny were among the number who had been
shot dead, or who had leaped overboard on their discomfiture.</p>

<p>After this &eacute;meute there were always five sentries on deck
in the daytime with loaded muskets, two of whom were stationed on
the poop, two at the forecastle, and another at the waist with
drawn bayonet only. All else on board resumed its wonted course,
nor did anything of moment more occur until, a few days after
passing the island of St Peter and St Paul, the captain descried a
sail, and found it was standing on such a course that the
<i>Magnet</i> must certainly pass very near her, which happened
accordingly, and the vessels were quickly within hail. The stranger
was a long low schooner, whose masts raked very much, and as the
mariners said, &ldquo;she loomed very suspicious altogether&rdquo;;
but as she had then apparently altered her course, no more was
thought of it that day. In the grey haze of the next morning,
however, she again bore down, and was close to them before she was
perceived by anyone on board the convict ship. Suddenly a call was
heard: &ldquo;Port! Port your helm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next instant the loud sullen boom of a heavy piece of
artillery awoke the slumbers of that watery world. Directly after,
a voice was heard to hail in some foreign tongue from the schooner,
to which Captain Boltrope replied, &ldquo;An English convict ship
bound from Portsmouth to New South Wales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Rashleigh hurried on dock. This, being quite an event in
the annals of their voyage, had roused his curiosity, and he now
found the schooner lying to at a short distance, her sails flapping
idly against her masts. Most of the passengers by the
<i>Magnet</i>, and the military officers, were on her poop. From
the observations made among these, it appeared that none on board
the stranger seemed to understand English; but immediately
afterwards the gaudy flag of Portugal was hoisted at the
schooner&rsquo;s gaff, and another gun fired towards the English
vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That gun was shotted, by &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; roared
out the old mate, as he looked aloft, apparently pursuing the
course of the ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; rejoined one of the military officers;
&ldquo;it is time we began to look out, captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Boltrope replied, &ldquo;Aye, aye, sit. We&rsquo;ll soon
see what sort of stuff she&rsquo;s made of. Hoist away the Union
jack there. Mr Travis, jump down below, and hand up a lot of
cartridges and wads. Dr MacMorrogh, will you turn all your men up
on deck? They can help to load and run the guns in and out. Ease
her off, my lad at the helm! Bring her starboard side to bear on
the stranger. By the Lord, we&rsquo;ll astonish you, my joker,
directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to fight her then, sir?&rdquo; enquired Dr
Dullmere, a Scottish Presbyterian minister who was on board. in
great fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fight?&rdquo; replied the old tar. &ldquo;Fight, aye?
Why, that <i>is</i> a good &rsquo;un. To be sure, I <i>do</i> mean
to fight. Do you think for a moment I&rsquo;m going to have my ship
plundered, and that glorious bit of buntin&rsquo;&rdquo; (pointing
to the flag of England now flying at the peak) &ldquo;insulted by a
damned rogue like that? No, no! jemmy Boltrope will never stand
that, while we&rsquo;ve got forty sojers on board, besides all this
mob, who are most of &rsquo;em wicked enough to fight the devil
himself, were he to rise out of the ocean with seven heads and ten
horns, like the beast in the Book of Revelations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the captain was talking he was also busy, clearing away
the poop for action; but the parson had vanished, and his place was
far better supplied by ten or a dozen of the soldiers, who now
appeared, as the skipper said, &ldquo;in full fighting fig&rdquo;.
The military officer, at his request, now detached four more
soldiers into each of the tops, and great was the laughter of
Captain Boltrope at the lubberly way in which the &ldquo;leather
necks&rdquo;, as he called them, got up to their new posts.</p>

<p>In the mean time a boat had been lowered from the stranger,
apparently full of armed men, and was rowed towards the
<i>Leviathan</i>; but on seeing the military guard displayed on the
poop, forecastle and tops, the commander of the boat shouted out
again to someone in his own vessel, and loud cries of
&ldquo;<i>prisonniers</i>! <i>prisonniers</i>!&rdquo; or something
of the kind, burst from many voices in both the schooner and the
boat. The latter was now rowed back to the stranger, which soon
after filled its sails and stood away.</p>

<p>From this incident until the end of their dreary voyage no other
occurrence of any moment took place, and many were the hearts that
bounded with mingled anticipations when one evening the cry of
&ldquo;Land ho!&rdquo; was heard from the mast-head; which, upon
the vessel&rsquo;s approaching a little nearer, was declared to be
the coast of New Holland, but some distance to the southward of
their expected haven, which it was supposed, however, they would be
nearly abreast of by the next morning; and eve sank down upon all
on board the <i>Magnet</i> engaged in various contemplations of
what fate might have in store for them in the land to which they
were now exiled and which they were so rapidly approaching.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">The band of Romulus, it is most certain,<br>
Were ruffian stabbers and vile cutpurse knaves;<br>
Yet did this outcast scum of all the earth<br>
Lay the foundations of the eternal city.</p>

<p>Before daybreak next morning the light of Port Jackson was
visible from the deck of the <i>Leviathan</i>, and shortly
afterwards that trusty vessel entered the Heads &mdash; two bold
bluff precipices, between which lies the entrance to that spacious
harbour, supposed to be one of the finest on the surface of the
globe. A pilot had come on board to direct the course of the ship
to her anchorage; and during the run of nearly seven miles from the
entrance of the Port to the site of the town of Sydney Rashleigh
had ample opportunities of scanning the external features of the
land in which he was destined to find his future home.</p>

<p>The shores of Port Jackson then possessed few charms, either
natural or acquired: sandy bays opening to great distances inland,
bordered apparently by stunted trees; rocky headlands between each
inlet, crowned with similar foliage; and far away, on either hand,
a background displaying dense forests of sombre green. There were
then none of those elegant mansions or beautiful villas, with their
verdant and ever blooming gardens, which now so plentifully meet
the eye of the new colonist, affording abundant proofs of the
wonted energy of the Anglo-Saxon race, who speedily rescue the most
untamed sods from the barbarism of nature and bid the busy sounds
of industry and art awaken the silent echoes of every primeval
forest in which they are placed.</p>

<p>Not a single patch of cultivated soil appeared in those days to
refresh the sight of the wearied voyagers with evidences that here
the foot of civilised man had ever trod prior to their arrival. One
of the passengers, who had visited New South Wales before, called
the attention of his companions on the poop to an isle called
Garden Island, and Ralph looked towards the spot, expecting now, at
least, to detect some proof of the reclaiming hand of man. But
alas, the so-called Garden Island presented nothing to his view but
a doubly sterile mass of rugged grey rocks rising from the bosom of
one of the numerous bays, and crowned with the same unvarying
livery of russet green; but as they rounded the next projecting
point they came in view of a small embattled building on a height,
which was said to be one of the forts at the entrance of Sydney
Cove. Immediately afterwards they saw a straggling range of
cottages, mostly of a very small size, which stretched along an
eminence, and which were declared by their informant to be a
portion of the town of Sydney known as &ldquo;The Rocks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The <i>Magnet</i> was shortly brought to anchor opposite a neck
of land on which stood a slaughter-house, and our voyagers could
survey the greater part of the town from a very favourable
position. The dwellings appeared to he chiefly of one story; in
fact, most of them deserved no better name than huts. The streets
were narrow and straggling; nor did there seem to be more than half
a dozen good or convenient private buildings in the town. There was
no cultivated land to be seen from their station, and but a very
few miserable cottages, peeping here and there out of the trees,
stood upon the north shore of the harbour, in various parts of
which there were then about six other large vessels at anchor,
besides a good number of small cutters and boats which were passing
to and fro continually.</p>

<p>The day after their arrival, the Colonial Secretary, the
Principal Superintendent of Convicts, and other officers came on
board to muster the newly arrived prisoners, who were each called
separately into the cabin, asked their names, ages, religions,
native places, trades and a host of other interrogatories, the
replies to which were taken down and a personal description of each
convict added. When this ceremony had been gone through with all
the new arrivals, these official visitors departed and a number of
other persons came on board, some seeking news from the &ldquo;old
country&rdquo;, some to enquire after expected relations, a few of
the great ones to ascertain what sort of men the <i>new chums</i>
were, and whether there were certain descriptions of persons among
them, according to the wants of each querist in the article of
labour.</p>

<p>Among others who thus came was an elderly gentleman who kept an
academy, whose object was to enquire for a suitable assistant in
his scholastic labours. The surgeon superintendent accordingly
recommended Ralph Rashleigh, who was at that moment writing in an
inner cabin. Being called out, he was presented to the applicant,
who questioned him as to his attainments. The answers appeared to
prove satisfactory and the schoolmaster departed.</p>

<p>In about a fortnight from their arrival the prisoners on board
were again mustered preparatory to their going on shore and
received each a new suit of clothing, after which they were placed
in boats, by divisions, and rowed to a spot of land near Fort
Macquarie, where, being landed, they waited until all had arrived
and then proceeded through a part of the public promenade known as
the Domain, up to the Prisoners&rsquo; Barracks, where they were
placed in a back yard by themselves, and shortly afterwards again
paraded. On their dismissal a host of the older prisoners
insinuated themselves among them for the purpose of bargaining for
clothes, trinkets or other property, and many a poor <i>new
chum</i> &mdash; the distinctive name bestowed upon them by the old
hands &mdash; was deprived of all his little stock of comforts by
the artifices of the others, who appeared to pique themselves in no
small degree upon the dexterity with which they could thus <i>pick
up</i> (rob) the unwary new-comers.</p>

<p>The day after Rashleigh&rsquo;s landing the dispersion of his
shipmates began, and in four days there remained but himself and
two others out of about 140 who had safely reached the Colony with
him, the remainder having all been sent, or, as the phrase ran,
&ldquo;assigned&rdquo;, to the service of private individuals, by
tens, fours, threes, or single individuals, according to the
priority of application or degree of interest possessed by the
masters. Most of these men were employed at the trades or
occupations to which they had been brought up or accustomed, except
such as had been used to trades which were not then in existence in
New South Wales. <i>They</i> were assigned as labourers and sent
into the interior. Of these the most numerous class was the
weavers, who subsequently made but sorry shifts at using the axe or
the hoe, the latter being by far the most usual mode of tilling the
soil in that early period of Australian agriculture.</p>

<p>As for Rashleigh, he was in a few days sent to the schoolmaster
whom he had seen on board the ship, and after a long lecture from
his employer touching his future conduct, was duly installed into
office, which, truly, was all but a sinecure, for the <i>system</i>
or rather <i>no system</i>, of education pursued at this
&ldquo;classical and commercial academy&rdquo;&mdash; for such, in
sooth, it professed to be &mdash; was full easy for both
instructors and instructed. It was most true that in Ralph&rsquo;s
after experience he never found any of his quondam pupils had
attained any very high grade of scientific or literary acquirement;
but then, the meeting was always a pleasant one, nevertheless,
because the pseudo-scholars ever remembered their tutor with
gratitude as one who was always ready to do his <i>devoir</i> at
obtaining them a holiday, if he could, upon any pretence or no
pretence at all.</p>

<p>The chief of this &ldquo;educational establishment&rdquo; was
much more fond of his amusements by day and the allurements of the
social glass by night, than the toil inseparable from that
&ldquo;delightful task&rdquo; which Mrs Barbauld has sung so
sweetly. His assistant, Rashleigh, who was now, once more,
respectably clad and enjoyed a good deal of liberty out of school
hours, began to form acquaintances among other educated prisoners,
chiefly clerks in government offices, who were wont to meet, after
they had concluded the small share of what they were pleased to
call work that fell to the portion of each, to discuss matters of
more weighty and deep moment, no less than the affairs of the
State, which, being everybody&rsquo;s business, were, as is usual
in the opinion of such <i>sages</i> at least, most shamefully
neglected.</p>

<p>But alas, no prophet is honoured in his own age or country, and
the political disquisitions of these learned pundits at last
attracted the attention of the Sydney police, who were so illiberal
as to take umbrage at them. And one evening, when our hero, who
began to feel the full fervour of <i>amor patriae</i> for his
adopted country, was loudly descanting upon her wrongs under the
iron sway of General Darling, then Governor, an addition to the
auditory, equally unexpected and unwelcome, was made in the persons
of half a dozen constables under the command of a chief who had
formerly been a member of that fraternity, so useful to anatomical
science, yclept <i>stiff-hunters</i>, or body-snatchers.</p>

<p>This man of office, with awful brow, began to question all of
the amateur politicians as to their appellations and places of
residence, but specially honoured Ralph Rashleigh, whose oratorical
display he had so cruelly marred, with a double portion of his
scrutiny. No further steps were taken that night, the party of
embryo Demosthenes&rsquo; being permitted to repair to their
several abodes, marvellously discomfited at this malapropos
interruption.</p>

<p>After this Rashleigh dared not seek the same society for a
while, and confined his amusements to walks in the town and
neighbourhood, for though accustomed, as he had been, latterly at
least, to scenes of vulgarity and to association with the lowest of
the human race, even his mind revolted from mingling with the only
sort of companions accessible to him.</p>

<p>The town at that time contained but two classes, one comprising
the high government officers and a very few large merchants, who
formed at that period the aristocracy of Australia. The other was
composed of men who, like Ralph, either were or had been convicts,
or, to use the milder colonial phrase, &ldquo;prisoners of the
Crown&rdquo;. Many of the last, who were now free, had become very
wealthy; but Heaven knows, they formed no exception to the
description given by Pope of those on whom riches are generally
bestowed, they being, he says,</p>

<p><i>Given to the fool, the vain, the mad, the evil</i>,<br>
<i>To ward, to waters, chartres, and the devil</i>.</p>

<p>And surely, the men among the freed convicts of New South Wales
who had acquired riches offered abundant evidence of the truth of
the above couplet, the nucleus of their gains having been acquired
either by the exercise of every art of fraud, or at least by
chicanery, and in some cases by pandering to the grossest vices of
their fellow-convicts, whose chief luxuries. and in fact the grand
<i>prima mobile</i> or <i>summa bona</i> of whose existence were
<i>rum</i> and <i>tobacco</i>, to wallow in beastly drunkenness
being to them the very acme of earthly bliss! As our adventurer was
thus debarred from such male society as he preferred, he would fain
have sought for solace among the gentler sex, who were beneficently
bestowed by the creator to soothe the cares and enhance the
blessings of man; but here the case was even worse, for the only
females accessible to a person in Rashleigh&rsquo;s situation had
also reached the Colony as prisoners, and in pity to the frailties
of the softer part of the creation the author willingly draws a
veil over the description given by Ralph of the
&ldquo;ladies&rdquo; of Sydney in those early days.</p>

<p>But the time was now at hand when a new phase in the life of a
convict was about to open upon our hero. In about a month after the
occurrence before related, when the police had interrupted his
diatribe against the Governor, a constable came one day to the
school with an order from the Chief Superintendent of Convicts that
Ralph Rashleigh should accompany the bearer to Hyde Park Barracks;
a mandate with which he was fain to comply, though sundry
misgivings as to the purport of the recall shot athwart his mind.
When he reached that establishment he was placed in strict and
solitary confinement, and the next day, before sunrise, having been
handcuffed, was dispatched in the care of a messenger, on the road
to a Government Agricultural Establishment situated at Emu Plains,
about thirty-five miles from Sydney. He was not to be permitted to
call at his former abode or to obtain from thence any clothing or
other necessaries. The messenger in whose charge he was proved
obdurate to all his entreaties or offers of a bribe if he would
only allow him to diverge a few yards from his road for any
purpose; and thus he was compelled to march along in the slight
dress he wore while teaching and having on a thin pair of shoes,
which, long before he reached the end of his day&rsquo;s stage, at
Parramatta, were dropping from his feet in tatters. The day
following he was obliged to march the remaining twenty miles
barefooted over miserable apologies for roads, the greater part of
which lay along stony ranges, so that his feet were cut and
bleeding from twenty wounds before they reached their
destination.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">Robin: Work! Work! Work! All the day long! No such
thing as stopping a moment, to rest yourself, for if you only
straighten your back, up comes the overseer, and then
<i>&mdash;&mdash;.</i></p>

<p>Having crossed in a punt the splendid sheet of water which the
Nepean river forms at Penrith, nearly at sunset on the second day
of their journey, our weary travellers had a view of the broad
expanse of Emu Plains, which afforded a noble prospect. But
Rashleigh was too tired and full of pain to appreciate its
beauties, only looking forward to the hope of a rest in some shed,
however humble, and caring but little, at the moment, what might be
his lot on the morrow, so he might enjoy a little present repose.
They had yet a mile to pass over from the river; and when that
intervening space had at last been crossed, they entered the
<i>camp</i> &mdash; as it was called &mdash; a collection of huts
built on both sides of the way, which might have reached to the
number of nearly thirty. Though of all kinds, they were invariably
of the same materials, being formed of split slabs of timber, one
end of which was set in the earth and the other nailed to a pole,
that formed a wall-plate above it, the whole being covered with
sheets of bark.</p>

<p>The external appearance of these dwellings was anything but
captivating, for the materials of which they were built had been
all used quite green, and in seasoning, the slabs had shrunk one
from another, so that a man could easily pass his hand through
between them. In different places these chinks had been stopped up
with old rags, parts of which, projecting farther than they were
intended, either hung down in <i>beauteous</i> negligence or waved
to and fro at the bidding of each capricious breeze. Glass, of
course, there was none to any of the numerous openings called
windows, they being supposed to be closed by shutters made of
boards nailed on a sort of frame; but both these and the doors,
from the same cause as the slabs, had shrunk to such a degree that
the openings between the boards were half as wide as the boards
themselves.</p>

<p>Here Rashleigh was given over in charge to the camp constable, a
tall, stout countryman with a limp in his gait, who shortly piloted
him to the residence of the superintendent of Emu Plains, or to
Government house, as it was called. He was there directed by his
conductor to wait while the other entered the mansion. In a brief
space a personage made his appearance followed by the constable,
who stood bareheaded behind him and motioned our adventurer to pull
off his hat.</p>

<p>The superintendent was engaged in reading a letter, during which
operation Ralph had time to scan the personal appearance of a man
whom he had often heard spoken of before as a terror to all the
convicts in the Colony. This official was rather above the middle
stature, of an exceedingly swarthy complexion, with brows of
portentous gloom, and when he spoke the stern severity of his tone
belied not the austerity of his looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, my fine fellow,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;you are
inclined to politics, are you? Wen, we will try if we cannot find
you something else to think of here. You are sent to this
establishment to learn field labour, and on no account to be
employed in any other way for two years. When that time has expired
you will he assigned to a settler. Take him away, Row, and send the
principal overseer to me when the gangs come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our hero now followed his conductor back to the camp, where the
latter said with a sneer, in a strong west country dialect,
&ldquo;As you bees another of theasem dom&rsquo;d quill drivers, I
do zuppose you had better be put along with the rest; so you will
stop in the pla&rsquo;house there&rdquo;, indicating an irregular
sort of straggling-looking mass of buildings, all of them of the
same stringy-bark order of architecture with the huts before
described, from which it differed in no degree save size.</p>

<p>Rashleigh, who was really tired, nearly to death, and would have
given worlds, had he possessed them, long before, to have been
permitted to lie down, soon made his way to the hovel in question.
Finding the door open, though the inmates were absent, he walked in
and flung himself upon a rude bench made of a piece of split
timber, set upon two stumps sunk in the earthen floor.</p>

<p>He now surveyed the interior of his future dwelling, which he
quickly discovered was in perfect good harmony with its external
<i>attractions</i>. Like the famed mansion of that worthy who
delighted in the cognomen of &ldquo;Jack Straw&rdquo;, it was
neither wind &mdash; nor water-tight; frequent awful gaps in the
bark roof plainly indicated the causes of the many puddles on the
dirt floor, and the cracks between the slabs freely admitted the
playful vagrancy of every sportive zephyr. Furniture Rashleigh saw
none save a table, made in the same manner as the bench on which he
sat, two large iron pots, and a few vessels of tin.</p>

<p>His fatigue soon overpowered him, and he fell fast asleep; nor
did he awake until he was rather roughly shaken by the shoulder, a
man telling him at the same time that he must get up and answer his
muster. He now staggered half asleep outside the hut; and in a few
minutes the camp constable, with a train of watchmen, came bearing
a lantern, which one of them held while another called over the
names of the prisoners belonging to that hut, Rashleigh, of course,
being last. In his simplicity he now asked the great man of office
where he was to sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherever yow like, and be dom&rsquo;d to yow,&rdquo; was
the <i>courteous</i> reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But shall I not get a bed and blanket?&rdquo; asked the
<i>new chum</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell &lsquo;ee what!&rdquo; retorted the
other. &ldquo;On&rsquo;y I think yow bees a fool, by what
yow&rsquo;ve been up to in Sydney, I&rsquo;d knock yow down for
axing me such a dom&rsquo;d stupid question. But I&rsquo;ll
<i>compute</i> it to yower ignorance. and tell yow there an&rsquo;t
no blankets for nobody in the stores. There&rsquo;s two hundred men
here a&rsquo;ready wi&rsquo;out any, and many on &rsquo;em has been
so for more nor this two years; so doan&rsquo;t &lsquo;ee be
bothering me any more, or else I&rsquo;ll be dom&rsquo;d if I
doan&rsquo;t find a shop for &lsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this <i>cheering</i> assurance he departed, and Ralph
followed the party into the interior, where one of the men observed
&ldquo;old Tom Row was getting good because he did not put the new
chum in the chokey,&rdquo; and another man, assenting, added that
sometimes he had &ldquo;knowed a dozen men put in for less than
half that provocation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph now begged to be informed what he had said that could by
any possibility be construed into a crime; and the first speaker
replied, &ldquo;Lord bless you, stop a bit. You&rsquo;re like a
motherless cub, all your sorrows to come. You&rsquo;ll soon find
out the men in office here don&rsquo;t want to receive no
provocation to get a man flogged, for they delight in making out
schemes to do so without&rdquo;&mdash; an observation Rashleigh had
abundant opportunities of verifying by actual experience
afterwards. But he now enquired what shifts the rest of the men
made for bedding who, like himself, were without any. His informant
said some got a few sheepskins, which, indeed, were mostly stolen
from drays passing on the road, and they sewed them together,
rolling themselves up in them at night; while those who
hadn&rsquo;t the luck to get any skins had lately found out a way
to prepare tea-tree bark for the same purpose; and he volunteered
to show our hero the method of doing this the first leisure time he
had.</p>

<p>Rashleigh returned his thanks, and as there was no other remedy,
lay down in the ashes of the fireplace, Which, like those of the
olden time in England, was spacious enough to allow half a dozen
men to do so, besides leaving room enough for the fire, as it, in
fact, occupied all one end of the hut. Here, though he was very
hungry, he quickly fell asleep again, and awoke not until an
excessive bustle caused him to do so.</p>

<p>Looking around him, he quickly perceived it was morning. The hut
was nearly empty of its inmates, who were running out in great
haste. Our adventurer jumped up. Being already dressed he found now
to be some advantage, and he followed the throng of men he saw
before him, going towards the camp gate, which Ralph was about to
pass through, when the camp bell, which till now had been rolling
most vociferously, ceased to ring; and instantly as it did so, a
florid-faced man mounted on a black mare spurred across the
gateway, stopping the egress, and roaring out, &ldquo;Stop there,
you sons of bitches! I&rsquo;ll teach you fellows to come a little
smarter to muster. Here, Sam, take these men&rsquo;s names
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam&rdquo; was a clerk. albeit he wore a most unclerkly
appearance, being very ragged, with an old pair of slop shoes on,
that, having been immensely too large for him at first, had turned
up at the toes, until the soles were now staring their wearer in
the face. On the back part of his occiput he wore what had once
been a cap made of kangaroo skin; but the crown, being nearly out,
now overhung, flapping against his back; and the whole <i>tout
ensemble</i> of this pupil of the pen much resembled what in
Scotland is called a &ldquo;potato bogle&rdquo;, and in England a
&ldquo;scarecrow&rdquo;. He now began to take down the names of
those men that were inside the gate, of course, including our
luckless adventurer whom the principal overseer no sooner saw than
he cried Out, &ldquo;Oho, my fine quill-driver, you are beginning
well, at any rate! Here, Joe! Take this chap into your mob, and try
if you can&rsquo;t waken him up a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this, Joe &mdash; as he was styled &mdash; a little
bandy-legged chocolate-cheeked Jew, said, &ldquo;Come here, you,
sir. S&rsquo;help mine Gott, I&rsquo;ll shtir you up before
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the names of all the men being read over,
each shouldered his implement of labour, and the gangs began to
move off; but for Rashleigh&rsquo;s part, the overseer Joe called
him and ordered him to take up a rope that lay near, and bring it
along. Ralph looked at the rope, which appeared heavy enough to
load a horse, it being nearly as thick as a cable and of great
length. He attempted to lift it, but finding it far beyond his
strength, he was fain to desist. He then received a volley of oaths
from the little Jew, and two men being called, they placed the rope
on his back. It was as much as he could stagger under, and finding
it impossible to walk steadily, he ran a few paces, when his foot
caught something, and he fell beneath his load, cutting his shin
upon a root, so that it bled profusely. But the inflexible Joe
directed the rope to be replaced on his back, which was done, and
although he repeatedly fell down, it was as repeatedly again
hoisted on his back, until at length, trembling in every limb from
the intensity of this over-exertion, Ralph reached the scene of
their appointed labour.</p>

<p>The gang under the orders of overseer Joe was at present
employed in burning off the trees, which had been some time
previously fallen, for the purpose of clearing the land and
reducing it to culture. To do this the huge monarchs of the forest,
now recumbent, were lopped of all their boughs, and the larger
limbs and branches cross cut with saws into convenient lengths, the
stumps of the trees having before had all the earth dug away from
around them, so that the roots were laid bare, many of tile smaller
ones being cut through. The timber was then piled around and over
these stumps, the butts or large logs beneath, and the smaller and
lighter branches above, the interstices being filled up with twigs,
bark and chips, to make the whole ignite readily; and when a
suitable number of the stumps had been thus made ready &mdash; or
in wet weather, as fast as they were prepared &mdash; the masses
were lighted, the fires, if necessary, being attended to until the
firewood and with it the stump were completely burned out.</p>

<p>All the gang, having now arrived at the scene of action, were
quickly distributed to their several tasks; and Ralph and some
others each obtained a wooden handspike, with which to roll out the
trunks of trees or carry them upon to the fires for which they were
designed. A favourite plan with the overseer &mdash; Joe &mdash;
who appeared to delight in oppressing his men as much as possible,
was to cause six or eight handspikes to be laid on the ground
before a large trunk of wood, which was then rolled thereupon;
twelve or sixteen men, one at each end of the handspikes, lifted
the trunk bodily up, on which master Joe would order six of their
number away, on pretence that the remainder were well able to carry
the log. These were thus often compelled to strain every nerve to
do so; otherwise, if any one gave way, of course the log fell to
the earth, and those on the same side with the defaulter stood in
imminent danger of fractured limbs. But should they escape these,
they were certain of incurring punishment from Joe, who would
surely cause them, every man, to be flogged for neglect of work,
or, at least, put into &ldquo;Belly Bot&rdquo; that night.</p>

<p>Again, this worthy would pitch upon one of the gang who had
incurred his anger &mdash; which it was most easy to do, by the by
&mdash; generally someone who was old or constitutionally infirm,
and having selected a stump or short block of wood of the very
uttermost weight any ordinary man could carry, he would call the
culprit to him and cause two other men to lift this burden upon his
shoulders, directing him to carry it to some distant fire. If the
poor fellow could at all make shift to move under his load, he
would stagger off, amid the jeers of the overseer and his toadies.
When he had nearly reached the place where he supposed he had been
directed to carry the load to, Joe would shout with the lungs of a
Stentor &mdash; for though a small, stunted abortion of humanity,
he had wondrously effective lungs &mdash;: &ldquo;You blasted
crawler, where are you going to? That&rsquo;s not the fire. Take it
over to the one far over there, on your right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor wretch, frightened at the threatening tone and language
of the overseer, would now attempt to go as ordered; but Joe would
still keep on, roaring out, &ldquo;Not there&rdquo;, &ldquo;Or
there&rdquo;, wherever he went, until at last the man, being
utterly exhausted, would fail himself or perchance throw down the
load, when he was certain of condign punishment from the bench of
the magistrates.</p>

<p>It may seern strange that such doings were allowed; but besides
this establishment being a place of punishment for convicts who
misbehaved in a minor degree, yet whose offences were not
cognisable by law, the superintendent was very anxious to get as
much work done as possible by any means. To effect this he selected
from among the convicts under his charge the worst behaved and most
indolent of the number for his overseers and other subordinates,
who, as he rightly judged, by being the most afraid of the
hardships of work themselves, would exercise all manner of rigour
towards their fellow-prisoners and exact as much labour as possible
from each, in order to keep their places. Thus it was that the men
were so much oppressed, for if one of these convict overseers were
working a gang of fifty men and had ten of them flogged every week
&mdash; no uncommon proportion &mdash; it became a mere matter of
arithmetical certainty that another who had a gang of twenty-five
could not do his duty unless he took five of his men to Court
weekly also.</p>

<p>Again, it was the policy of the superintendent to put two gangs
of similar strength at the same kind of work within view of each
other, when the overseers would vie one with the other to try which
could get most done; and dire was then the cursing, swearing,
raging and tearing of the rivals, who would goad on their men every
instant with threats of the torturing lash, uttered with all the
real arrogance of low-bred jacks-in-office, who, it need hardly be
said, were capable of any atrocity themselves, and would commit any
crime rather than descend from their ill-sustained eminences to
work among their fellows. This is premised, lest the reader should
scarcely believe what follows; yet there are many scores now alive
in New South Wales who can vouch for the truth of the leading
features.</p>

<p>Rashleigh and his fellows were quickly immersed in their
fatiguing occupation, grimed from head to foot with charcoal from
the logs they carried, and blinded by the smoke from the numerous
fires near at hand; until at length, being employed with the others
in turning the huge butt of a tree which was partially embedded in
the earth by the force of its fall, Ralph, through his awkwardness,
placed the end of his handspike between the body of the tree and a
broken limb which was attached to it, and which formed a very acute
angle with the body of the log. When, after many oaths and the
expenditure of much sweat, the log at last was moved, it went over
with a sudden jerk; and the branch referred to, striking the back
of Ralph&rsquo;s handspike as it turned over, of course forced the
implement out of his grasp, and the handspike whizzed through the
air, passing so close to overseer Joe&rsquo;s head that it tore a
portion of the brim of his hat away in its flight, and then
ploughed a furrow in the earth for some distance behind him. Most
assuredly, if it had struck his head, this worthy would have ended
his days on the spot; but fate had otherwise decreed the issue, and
Joe, transported with rage, now rushed towards Rashleigh, pouring
forth a volley of mingled threats and execrations.</p>

<p>It chanced that upon his way he had to pass the trench out of
which the log had just been turned; here there lay, now exposed to
view, an enormous Jew lizard &mdash; a kind of reptile supposed to
derive its name from the membranous bags around its jaws, which it
distends with air when enraged, so as to form a slight resemblance
to a human beard. This the overseer nearly trod upon; but drawing
back, he lifted it on his foot, casting it with great fury towards
the unlucky Rashleigh, who, on his part, seeing the unknown but
very forbidding reptile come flying towards his throat, made an
involuntary blow at it with his right hand; and Joe being now close
to him. the lizard was flung full in his face. Dropping from thence
on his breast, it began tearing away at his handkerchief and shirt,
until one of the bystanders assisted the affrighted Israelite to
remove it. The latter no sooner recovered himself than he ordered
Rashleigh to be secured, vowing, with the bitterest malice in every
gesture, that &ldquo;he&rsquo;d make him pay for all&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Ralph was seized by the deputy overseer and the
water carrier of the gang, and hustled to a tall bare stump
standing near, when a chain having been passed round it, he had his
hands locked behind his back to the chain by a pair of handcuffs.
In a few minutes Joe came up, and saying, &ldquo;You blasted
varment! I&rsquo;ll teach you to mutiny and try to take my life, I
will,&rdquo; he then struck the defenceless prisoner on the head,
knocking off his hat; and having thus given him a foretaste of what
he might expect from his brutality, this choice specimen of a
government officer then withdrew.</p>

<p>Not long after, the superintendent made his appearance on the
ground, and having demanded what Rashleigh had done, was informed
by the overseer that he had thrown a handspike at him and attempted
to take his life, showing his mutilated shirt and tom straw hat in
proof of what he alleged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him be confined in the camp until next Tuesday, and
then brought to court,&rdquo; said the great man.</p>

<p>At dinner-time, Rashleigh was marched a prisoner home, when
being given up to old Tom Row, that functionary grinned and said,
&ldquo;Oho! Thee bees danngerous, boost thee? Oi&rsquo;ll teake
cear thee does noa more dommage for one whoile!&rdquo; Thus saying,
he laid hold of the culprit&rsquo;s collar, and in this guise
conducted him to an open triangular space formed by the converging
ends of buildings erected on two sides of a square, the external
side of this space being secured by a high palisade fence, in which
was a small open wicket.</p>

<p>Tom Row pushed Ralph in at this opening with such force that the
latter almost fell headlong; as it was, he lost his hat in going
through. The old constable chuckled and said, &ldquo;There! Thee
bees safe enough naw! Thee&rsquo;ll knock nobody&rsquo;s brains out
naw, I&rsquo;ll warrant thee!&rdquo; And he laughed heartily while
he locked the gate. Rashleigh begged in vain that he might have the
handcuffs he wore transferred from behind his back to his front, as
the former position, besides being very painful, impeded any
attempts at helping himself. The other, however, only grinned and
left him.</p>

<p>Being bareheaded, and the sun now nearly vertical, he knew not
how to shield himself from its too powerful rays, which made him
feel both giddy and sick; but the open area in which he was
enclosed prevented his gaining any shelter until the afternoon,
when the sun&rsquo;s decline enabled him, by thrusting his head
against the end of one of the buildings, to obtain a little shelter
and relief. His dinner, a morsel of salt beef and a dough-boy, or
dumpling made of boiled maize meal, had been brought to him soon
after his confinement; but at the time he felt much too sick to eat
anything. When he got better he would fain have done so, but did
not know how, as the position of his hands, thus secured behind
him, would not permit any other mode of eating than by going down
on his belly and gnawing his food, like a dog, out of the dish.
This, at last, hunger compelled him to do, and he was compelled to
remain this way from the Thursday night until the following Tuesday
morning, without the handcuffs being once removed. It being
advanced in autumn, the nights were piercingly cold and the dews
abundant; so that our unhappy prisoner was regularly wet through
his flimsy rags every evening soon after sunset, and he spent each
long night shivering in this plight, not being dry again until the
sun acquired power enough to do so, after many evolutions and
turnings on his part to expose each side of his person alternately
to the beneficent source of heat. Sleeping, it may well be
imagined, was almost out of his power, as independent of the cold
preventing him, the constrained position in which his arms were
confined produced intense pain. In the bitterness of his anguish he
repeatedly wished for death, and in order to effect it ran his head
with great violence two or three times against an angle of one of
the sheds; but this only added to his excruciating torments.</p>

<p>At last the morning of Tuesday arrived, and his keeper came to
order him out of this wretched place of confinement. It was
necessary he should he washed, and for this purpose his handcuffs
were taken off, but the anguish of bringing his cramped arms round
again into their natural position completely overpowered him, and
he fell fainting to the earth. When he recovered he found himself
lying in a puddle of water; and the cause of it was disclosed by
the sneering laugh of one of the constables standing by with an
empty bucket in his hand, who asked, &ldquo;An&rsquo;t I a fine
doctor to bring any fellow out of a swound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph got up, and then, for the first time, saw that his wrists
were swollen to more than twice their original size; and when he
tried to wash his face lie found he could not bend his arms to do
so. This swelling produced one good effect: there was not a single
pair of handcuffs to be procured that would go upon his wrists, and
consequently they were, sorely against their will, obliged to
permit him to go over to Penrith without any. But one of his
feflow-convict constables marched alongside of him, having received
strict injunctions from Tom Row at parting, that if the prisoner
made the slightest attempt to escape, the constable was to knock
him down that minute, for, added this <i>humane</i> official,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no odds breaking the heads of a score such
fellows as he. There&rsquo;s plenty more of his sort in the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this guise they reached the Court-house without any
interruption, and they found the business of the day there far
advanced. There were a great many men &mdash; as usual, from Emu
Plains &mdash; brought up to answer various charges of insolence to
overseers, neglect of work, breach of regulations, or disobedience
to orders; and the majority of them had already been tried and
sentenced to receive various amounts of corporal punishment, from
seventy-five to a hundred lashes being the general proportion of
the sentences. A very few accounted themselves fortunate in only
having got fifty; and one man came out of the presence of the awful
conclave of magistrates wearing a countenance radiant with smiles.
On being asked by a compeer what had been his luck, he replied,
laughing, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve <i>nobbed</i> it. I&rsquo;ve got
life to Newcastle,&rdquo; meaning that he was fortunate in being
about to leave Emu Plains, though he was sentenced to go to pass
the rest of his days at a place of punishment of no common degree
of rigour.</p>

<p>Ralph&rsquo;s turn now came to be heard, and he was placed at
the bar before the magistrates, who were an ancient parson, an old
settler and a young military officer. Overseer Joe, being now
sworn, circumstantially related the facts of a most mutinous attack
and murderous assault which had been made upon him by the culprit,
who he said had shied a handspike with all his force at the head of
the said overseer, and he once more produced the mutilated straw
hat in proof of the narrow escape he had made from death. He added
that after this Ralph had come up to him and violently assaulted
his person, so as to tear his shirt &mdash; also produced &mdash;
and wound up by assuring the bench that he &ldquo;never knowed a
more desp&rsquo;rater, a more dangerouser ruffian than the willain
before them&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Rashleigh was now asked by the military gentleman what he had to
say, though the settler J.P. muttered two or three times, &ldquo;A
clear case, a very clear case. Never heard a clearer case.&rdquo;
As for the clerical gentleman, he had been asleep nearly ever since
Ralph came into Court. The prisoner, however, shortly detailed the
real facts of the case, making use of his hands and fingers to show
the relative positions of the log, branch and handspike. While he
was doing so the young officer observed the swollen state of his
wrists, and demanded to what this was owing, on which Rashleigh
narrated his sufferings in handcuffs. As the captain had not been
very long in the Colony, all these proceedings were quite new to
him and appeared to excite his compassion. He minutely questioned
our adventurer as to the facts, and finally, appearing to be
convinced that he spoke the truth, the military man turned to the
farmer magistrate with an air of astonishment and asked if it was
possible such cruelty could be allowed.</p>

<p>The other calmly replied that it was necessary the most
stringent measures should be adopted to control the turbulent
spirits of convicts and ensure their safe custody, that no doubt
the prisoner now before them was much better known to the
authorities of Emu Plains than to any other persons, and that, in
short, it would not <i>do</i> for the magistrates to interfere with
the duties of a government establishment like that or they should
never be out of hot water. The last portion of this reply was made
in a very low tone of voice, as if confidentially to the captain;
but Rashleigh&rsquo;s ears being sharpened by self-interest, he
caught it every word.</p>

<p>As soon, therefore, as he could speak with propriety, he
declared to the magistrates that this so-called offence had taken
place on the very first day he had been sent to work upon Emu
Plains, and also that this was the only charge that had as yet been
made against him since his arrival in the Colony. On this the
captain asked if he had any witnesses who could prove his
statement. The settler J.P. observed with a sneer,
&ldquo;Witnesses! Aye! I&rsquo;ll be bound he has. Fifty, if
that&rsquo;s all, ready to come and swear to that or anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; returned the militaire, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
take care of that. Let him name his witnesses to us only. Then let
him be closely confined over here till the next Court day, so that
he cannot see or speak to any of them. We will examine them
ourselves, and if he has attempted to impose upon us, we will give
him a hundred lashes in addition to the punishment of his
crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This proposal being agreed to, Rashleigh described four men who
had been working with him as well as he could to the military
magistrate, and the case stood over.</p>

<p>Upon the next Court day the same three magistrates attended, and
shortly after their arrival Rashleigh was again ushered into the
Courtroom. The reverend J.P. was installed into the chair, and the
captain and settler sat on either side of him. The proceedings
began by the clerk reading the deposition already made by the
overseer and the prisoner&rsquo;s defence. During this reading the
chairman, as was his wont, went to sleep, ever and anon making such
profound reverences to the back of the clerk that his reverend nose
appeared to be in imminent danger from the desk behind which he
sat. The settler J.P. in the mean time amused himself by reading a
newspaper. The captain next enquired whether the witnesses were in
attendance, and having ascertained that they were, he ordered one
to be called in.</p>

<p>This fellow, who was a raw countryman, made a loutish reverence
and looked very much afraid as he entered the room. He was sworn,
and the captain asked him if he knew the prisoner.</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>: (<i>scratching his head</i> &mdash; <i>with a
sort of leer</i>): Ees, sur; that is, noa, sur.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>: What do you mean by that? Did you ever see the
prisoner before?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>: (<i>very much afraid</i>): Whoy, Oi&rsquo;ve
a-seed un, sur, on the pleans.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>: Were you ever at work with him? Don&rsquo;t be
afraid, but speak.</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>: Ees, sur, Oi wor.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>: Well, do you know what he did to be brought
here?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>: Whoy sur, they do zay he troyed to kill
th&rsquo; overseer.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>: When did that happen?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>: That day as he wor at work wi&rsquo; Oi.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>: Were you there?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>: Oi wor a-working alongside of him.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>: Now, tell us what you saw of the matter.</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>: Whoy, sur, Oi on&rsquo;y seed the Jew lizard
a-tearing of Joe&rsquo;s shirt.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>: You did not see this man throw a handspike at
his overseer.</p>

<p>The witness replied that he did not, and a few more questions
satisfied the captain that the matter had occurred as Rashleigh had
stated; which was unwillingly confirmed by the other men, who all
gave their evidence in the prisoner&rsquo;s behalf with great
apparent reluctance, being obviously fearful that they would suffer
the ill will of the dreaded Joe for speaking the truth.</p>

<p>The captain now addressed the settler, and enquired what he
thought of the matter after that.</p>

<p>The agricultural Lycurgus smiled sarcastically and said,
&ldquo;Oh, captain, I leave it entirely to you. But when you have
been so long in this country as I have, you will not take much
notice of anything these fellows either say or swear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain now ventured to disturb the profundity of the
reverend chairman&rsquo;s slumbers by a gentle nudge, asking him at
the same time what he thought of the case.</p>

<p>That holy man suddenly jumped out of his seat, pulling up the
slack of his black silk small-clothes as he did so, and cried,
&ldquo;A most dreadful scoundrel, an atrocious villain. Send him to
Newcastle. Or stay! He won&rsquo;t stop there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Send
him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Send him Aye, send him to
<i>eternity</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; remonstrated the captain, &ldquo;it
don&rsquo;t appear to me he&rsquo;s guilty of any offence. Mr
Clerk, read over the last evidence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While this was being done the reverend gent settled himself for
another nap; but ere he could go to sleep again the brief notes
taken in the case were concluded, and he then said, &ldquo;Well,
well. Give him a hundred; it will help to smarten him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; quoth the son of Mars, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see he has deserved any punishment; or if he has,
surely what he has already suffered ought to be taken into
consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know the artfulness of these
scoundrels,&rdquo; retorted this <i>christian pastor</i>.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better give him seventy-five, at any
rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think rather,&rdquo; persisted the captain, &ldquo;we may let
him go this time; but if ever he comes again, we&rsquo;ll double
his punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well. Do as you please, captain,&rdquo; said the
chairman with an air of virtuous resignation; &ldquo;but the
overseers ought to be supported in their duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;but this man has
been twelve days now in strict confinement, and we&rsquo;ll take
that for his present punishment. Prisoner, you are discharged. Go
back and mind your work, for if ever you are brought here again,
you will not escape so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; added the farmer J.P. &ldquo;You shall receive
double punishment for giving us all this trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh was removed, and when the Court had concluded was
about to leave the place in charge of a constable, when overseer
Joe came up to them, his saffron-coloured cheeks fairly livid with
rage; and shaking his fist at our adventurer, he said, &ldquo;Gott
shtrike me dead, my fine fellow, if you an&rsquo;t the very first
man that ever beat me at Court; and I&rsquo;ll take blasted good
care you don&rsquo;t come off free next Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A commanding voice was now heard from within a pair of Venetian
blinds attached to the window of one of the rooms in the
Court-house close by. It called out, &ldquo;Come here, you,
sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s jaw dropped. He was about to walk off when the
blinds were pushed open suddenly, and the military magistrate
thrust his head out of the window and again called loudly and
passionately, &ldquo;Here, you, sir! You, overseer, I mean! Come
back instantly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe now very reluctantly complied, and pulling off his hat,
confronted the dreaded man of power bareheaded, while the latter
said, &ldquo;Now, sir, I happened to overhear your language just
now, and in the first place I&rsquo;ve the greatest mind in the
world to give you a most sound flogging for the daring impiety of
your expression; but as the Court has now broken up I will overlook
that. Still, I&rsquo;d have you take great care what you are about,
for if I catch you tripping in an oath, I&rsquo;ll prosecute you
myself for perjury. And by heaven, sir, I&rsquo;ll make you wish
you never had been born. Now be off to your duty, sir
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and <i>beware</i>!&rdquo; shaking his finger at Joe
in a most significant manner.</p>

<p>Joe now sneaked off, and he suffered not the grass to grow under
his feet until he was completely out of view from His
Majesty&rsquo;s Court-house, Penrith. Our adventurer was shortly
afterwards reconducted to the camp, when he was received by his
fellow-prisoners with a kind of awe, such as vulgar minds feel
towards a conjuror or person of wondrous acquirements. In fact, he
was looked upon by the convicts as being a kind of <i>lusus</i>
<i>naturae</i>, solely on account of his acquittal; for such a
phenomenon had never before been known in the history of Emu Plains
as a working man obtaining a victory over an overseer, or even of
getting the benefit of a doubt in his case when a charge was
preferred against him by such a hard-swearing fellow as Joe was
well known to be, it being a common saying of him &ldquo;that he
would swear a white horse was a chandler&rsquo;s shop, and every
hair upon his back a pound of candles&rdquo;, rather than be
vanquished.</p>

<p>Rashleigh slept this night in clover, for a man who had run away
a short time before had left behind him a little nook formed of a
sheet of bark like a boxed shelf, which was filled with the inner
husks of Indian corn. Among these the wearied wretch, who had not
since his arrival had any better resting-place than the slab door
of a lock-up or the cold earth, was too happy to burrow as quickly
as he could. In the dead hour of the night, however, he was aroused
by a most discordant din, arising, as it appeared, from half a
score or upwards of old tin dishes, beaten with fists, after the
fashion of gongs, and sundry other noises, which reminded him of
the manner in which the country people of England swarmed their
bees.</p>

<p>Upon enquiry, he learned that this unearthly turmoil was
occasioned by a party of men, who, having resolved to run away
themselves, adopted these means of beating up, as they called it,
for &ldquo;recruits for the bush&rdquo;!</p>

<p>In consequence of the execrable system of tyranny and
intolerable oppression perpetrated by the convict overseers,
constables, watchmen and others &ldquo;dressed in a little brief
authority&rdquo; upon this government farm, scarcely a week passed
without numbers of men absconding in this manner; and others were
actually paid by the petty officers, their fellow-convicts in
place, to do so, that the latter might gain either a pecuniary
reward or a remission of sentence for taking them prisoners again.
For instance, there was either a sum of ten shillings in money or a
remission of six months&rsquo; servitude allowed for every runaway
convict apprehended by another. It was a common practice,
therefore, for the overseers to oppress some poor fellow under them
until they had, as they called it, converted him into a crawler,
that is, a spiritless wretch heart-broken by hardship and hunger,
who could scarcely move, and who could not, then, do any proper
share of hard work. The overseer would next say to him. &ldquo;Why
the devil don&rsquo;t you <i>bolt</i> (run away)? I&rsquo;ll give
you some grub, to get rid of you;&rdquo; and the poor fellow,
willing even to earn a few days&rsquo; rest from labour by a sound
flogging, would at last agree to abscond. The same night he would
receive from his <i>kind friend</i> a few pounds of flour a small
quantity of tea and sugar, and perhaps a little meat, the overseer
promising him in addition his favour and protection after he should
succeed in getting the reward for taking him. It would then be
agreed by the crawler that in three days&rsquo; time, which it was
necessary should elapse before any reward would be given, the
overseer should meet him in a certain place, whither the latter
would go, as if by chance, and capture him. He would then bring his
prisoner before the magistrates, magnifying his exertions, of
course, in making this <i>capture</i>, and swearing a host of lies
respecting the desperate resistance made by the runaway, who would,
if it was his first offence, get off for the punishment of a
hundred lashes, being then returned to his work, where his overseer
would quickly turn him out of his gang, to be subject to the same
discipline from another, ending in the same results, except that
the runaway, on his second offence, would be punished by being sent
to a penal settlement. In this manner many of the convicts&rsquo;
officers shortened their allotted periods of servitude; for the
terms being eight, six, and four years for a life, fourteen, or
seven-year convict respectively, of course, if any of them could
thus capture half a dozen runaways, it at once wiped off three
years from his servitude.</p>

<p>The next day after Rashleigh returned from the Court at Penrith
he was ordered into a different gang, which was employed in felling
timber under the orders of one David Muffin, a Welshman, the
brutality of whose character will best be exemplified by the
following incident, which occurred the first morning our adventurer
was at work in his party.</p>

<p>The men were employed in pairs, and it chanced that two were
cutting down a huge tree, which proved to be quite decayed at the
heart; so that when they had chopped through the living timber, it
snapped off suddenly, and falling in the line on which the boughs
spread heaviest and farthest, crushed two ill-fated wretches
beneath its ponderous top. So instantaneous was its fall that not a
second&rsquo;s space was afforded for warning the sufferers, who,
being intent upon their work, did not observe the mass until, as it
proved, they were hurried into eternity. But four of the men who
were nearest ran to see if they could help their comrades; and they
were penetrated with horror to find only a shapeless mass of
quivering flesh and bones. denuded of all resemblance to the human
form, where but a twinkling of an eye before had stood two robust,
athletic young men in all the pride of conscious strength.</p>

<p>Davy, however, did not allow them to stand moralizing a moment
on the subject, for with a volley of oaths, he ordered his
satellites to put them, all four, into handcuffs for daring to
leave their work without his permission; and for this <i>crime</i>
they each got a punishment of fifty lashes on the next Court day.
Such being the temper of his overseer, it may very easily be
imagined Ralph Rashleigh&rsquo;s employment under him was anything
but agreeable, and as, although he was willing enough to work, he
was most awkward in his attempts to do so, he came in for a double
share of threats and abuse every time the overseer approached
him.</p>

<p>Thus waned the day, until, at the sound of a bell, the overseer
directed his deputy, or assistant, to collect the men and tools,
while he started off to the camp. Rashleigh was loaded with a heavy
rope, which he was told always fell to the lot of the man who had
last joined the gang to carry, and consequently he was among the
last that reached the tool-house, where, on throwing down his
burden, he found Davy, Joe and other overseers standing by a number
of men handcuffed to a chain, two and two, and guarded by two or
three of the camp constables. He was ordered to join this body,
which he did with a heavy heart, not doubting but that he was about
to be confined again, in order to be brought once more to Court. In
a few minutes the miserable cort&egrave;ge set forth towards a
place of security called &ldquo;Belly Bot&rdquo;, which was
situated about a mile from the camp, inside the first range of the
Blue mountains.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival here, they were ordered into the interior of
this receptacle, which was subdivided into cells about seven feet
by four feet in area and eight feet high, into each of which they
were literally crammed in an erect posture, until it was absolutely
impossible any more could be stowed in them, when the doors, which
shut from the outside, were closed upon them, squeezing them in
tight against each other.</p>

<p>They were then left to pass the night as best they could. To sit
or lie down was out of the question, unless some of them had been
willing to be undermost and would also permit the others to lie
upon them. But to prevent this possible contingency, a quantity of
water was daily thrown into each cell, which converted the stratum
of clay that formed the floor, with a very little trampling, into
mire, ankle-deep at least; and thus these unfortunates were obliged
to stand all night.</p>

<p>A little after daybreak next morning the doors of their dens
were thrown open, and they were ordered to be off to muster. This
they did as quickly as possible for fear of being too late, in
which case they were sure of receiving some further punishment; and
by the time they had reached the camp, the bell demanding their
attendance began to ring, so that they had barely time to snatch a
morsel of bread, which, eaten as they walked to work, formed their
only breakfast.</p>

<p>In this wretched manner Rashleigh spent five nights out of each
week for nearly three months after this, and was besides lumbered
almost six months, the latter meaning being obliged to work for
Government on Saturdays, while the rest of the men were allowed
from one o&rsquo;clock on that day to mend and wash their clothing.
This was the mode by which Mr Davy Muffin avenged upon our
adventurer the outrage which, through him, the majesty of
overseership had received in the person of his brother officer Joe.
This system of confining the men all night was allowed by the
regulations of the place to be put in force by the petty officers
as a sort of minor punishment for the misconduct of the working
prisoners, which they were at liberty to inflict without appealing
to any superior.</p>

<p>This, however, produced one tragical event in our hero&rsquo;s
presence. A man named Bright, of a gloomy morose temper, had been
confined in Belly Bot one night by his overseer. As was this
man&rsquo;s wont, he bore it in silence, not even grumbling or
saying one word to the men who were in durance with him; but on
reaching the camp next morning, he went into his hut, like the
others, for a piece of bread, and then walked across to the
tool-house, where the implements of labour were laid in readiness
for each man to take one with him to work. Bright here picked up a
very narrow felling-axe, which he generally used, and went on
towards the gate.</p>

<p>It chanced his overseer passed him on the way; and Bright said
to him, &ldquo;What made you put me into Belly Bot last night,
ToM?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a lark, you b &mdash; &mdash; &rdquo; replied
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then take that for a lark!&rdquo; responded Bright, at
the same time swinging his axe down with irresistible force, so
that he sank the head of the weapon to the poll in the
overseer&rsquo;s skull, until the edge protruded beneath his
victim&rsquo;s jaw.</p>

<p>So fell had been the blow that he could not disengage the axe
again; but the dying man having sunk on the ground before him, he
placed his foot on the body &mdash; for the overseer had neither
spoke nor moved from the moment he was struck; and Bright was now
struggling in vain to free his murderous weapon. In the mean time
some of the camp constables, whom his demoniac fury had perfectly
paralyzed before, rushed in and secured the murderer, who now
surrendered himself, saying, however, &ldquo;I wish I could have
loosed my axe. I&rsquo;d have made dog&rsquo;s meat of a dozen more
of you blasted tyrants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This man was soon after tried and hanged for his crime. When
called on for his defence, he only said he was tired of his life,
and all that he was sorry for was that he had not killed a hundred
such wretches instead of only one.</p>

<p>It might be supposed this would have some effect in altering the
system of the remaining overseers for the better. So far from it,
however, they became more brutally oppressive than ever, each one
after this carrying a huge club for protection; and if any of the
men only looked cross at one of them the overseer would say,
&ldquo;You are a-going to <i>bright</i> me, are you, you rascal?
I&rsquo;ll <i>chalk</i> you first, at any rate,&rdquo; finishing
his speech by knocking the offender down.</p>

<p>Nor was the ill-treatment of the overseers, combined as it was
with the hardship of perpetual labour, all the evil these luckless
men on Emu Plains had then to contend with. As remarked before,
nearly one half of them had no blankets or any other bedding. Happy
and luxuriously lodged was the wight who was master of a few pieces
of sheepskin, however acquired. The rest made beds of corn husks,
thrown loose on their berths; these, however, could be obtained
only once a year. For a covering to sleep under, they fabricated a
kind of rug by stitching together layers of the paper-like inner
bark of the Australian teatree. These rugs, indeed, were
exceedingly fragile, and when they became perfectly dry, would tear
like tissue paper. Some others wove a kind of matting of long
grass. But all these expedients were wretchedly inefficient, and
were it not that fuel was abundant, so that the prisoners could
thus maintain large fires at night in the winter season, they must
have suffered much more severely than they did. As it was, most of
the elder men were periodically laid up with the rheumatism, and
not a few lost the entire use of their limbs from paralysis.</p>

<p>The period of our adventurer&rsquo;s sojourn at Emu Plains was
also one of great dearth in the Colony, almost amounting to famine,
arising from drought. No rain having fallen in any part of the
country in sufficient quantity to cause vegetation for upwards of
two years, all the inhabitants were reduced nearly to a state of
starvation. Wheat was sold the year of his arrival on the Nepean
river at seventy shillings per bushel, and maize at forty
shillings, very little of either being in fact procurable at all.
And such indeed were the necessities of the lower class of free
colonists that when the government cattle were being slaughtered
upon Emu Plains &mdash; which was done weekly to supply meat for
the prisoners&rsquo; rations &mdash; the stockyard was absolutely
besieged by old and young, the inhabitants of the once fertile
district around, to beg of the convict butchers the entrails and
offal of the cattle, a bullock&rsquo;s paunch being esteemed a rich
gift, and the feet almost invaluable.</p>

<p>This being the destitution of the free population, it may well
be conceived the prisoners did not fare very luxuriously. The
ration they at this time received was a fractional quantity more
than five and a half pounds of flour and nine pounds of beef to all
men in the service of Government weekly. In addition to this each
obtained one gill of pease or an equivalent quantity of rice per
day. This formed the whole quantity out of which they were supposed
to make twenty-one meals; but in many places, where the whole
weekly supply was issued to each individual at once, the prisoners
would devour it all in, at most, three days, many of them, indeed,
in one day; and they would then starve through the rest of the week
as best they might, eking out a meal with various grasses and herbs
&mdash; for vegetables were not accessible to them even if the
seasons had permitted their growth &mdash; and in many cases
satisfying the cravings of hunger with snakes, rats, lizards and
even far more repugnant materials.</p>

<p>On one occasion a party of men stationed upon a road over the
mountains coaxed a fine dog belonging to a traveller. When he came
near they secured him with a noose after the mode of the South
American lasso, and managed to stifle his yells. When the
proprietor missed his faithful companion, and returned to the camp
of the road party, where he remembered having seen him within the
last half-hour, he saw a gaunt and hungry-looking wretch busily
engaged in skinning the poor dog&rsquo;s head. Upon questioning
this man, it turned out that a regular fight had ensued for the
dismembered limbs of poor &ldquo;Nelson&rdquo; as soon as the
carcase was skinned, and that this man, in the scramble, had only
got hold of the head, which he loudly complained was unfair.</p>

<p>As for the men on Emu Plains, their food was issued to them
daily, so that they were at least certain of one meal. such as it
was, in the twenty-four hours. To obtain more than this, many very
ingenious schemes were resorted to. From the time that peaches, of
which great quantities grew almost wild along the river banks, and
even nearer to the camp, had attained the size of hazel nuts, they
were eagerly sought after and devoured, many boiling them and
adding salt to the mess.</p>

<p>When the crop of maize began to ripen, a fresh plan was followed
by the starving wretches with much avidity. The men in the camp
were mustered twice every evening, the last time at eight
o&rsquo;clock, after which it was a punishable offence for anyone
to be found out of the hut to which he belonged; yet very many,
impelled by hunger, would, at the season referred to, dare all the
danger of being caught by the numerous watchmen round the camp, or
those in the corn fields, and steal off to the latter provided with
an old tin dish converted into a grater, or <i>fiddle</i>, as they
called it. They would then spend perhaps three or four hours
grating the scarcely Ripe cobs of maize with these implements,
until they might probably have succeeded in obtaining four quarts
of pulpy meal, and for this wretched booty they were content to
lose the greater portion of their rest, beside running the hazard
of obtaining at least a hundred lashes if detected.</p>

<p>So stringent were the rules of Emu Plains at this period of
scarcity that if a constable or watchman, on entering a hut &mdash;
which was done by one or other many times in the course of every
evening, to see what was going on &mdash; should chance to observe
the print of a cob of maize in the ashes of the fireplace, where
they were sometimes roasted by the prisoners for food, the
constable would question that unlucky wight who at the moment stood
nearest to the fire, and if he <i>could</i> not point out the
offender or <i>would</i> not do so, he was confined, and being
brought before the worshipful bench of magistrates the next Court
day, he was certain to receive seventy-five lashes, whether he had
been roasting a <i>Hawkesbury duck</i> &mdash; which was the
colonial phrase for a cob of parched maize &mdash; or not.</p>

<p>While our adventurer was thus placed amid scenes of suffering
the like of which he had never before wimessed, it may excite
surprise that he was not many times tempted to commit suicide; but
the fact is no less singular than certain, that the majority of men
only value life in a directly inverse ratio to the enjoyment it
might be supposed to afford them. Thus Rashleigh declared that
during his life of criminal prosperity in London, when he indulged
in every pleasure that money could purchase, he had never valued
existence half so highly as he did during the time of his most
intense suffering as an Australian convict. This appears a most
merciful dispensation of providence, for were it otherwise, there
can be no doubt that eighty out of every hundred malefactors who
for their crimes were exiled from England to this Colony of New
South Wales until about ten years ago would most certainly have
rushed headlong into eternity.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">The play, the play&rsquo;s the
thing<i>.</i></p>

<p>There were times when the yoke of this galling slavery was
rendered lighter. Among the prisoners at Emu Plains a theatre was
established under the auspices of one &ldquo;Jemmy King&rdquo;, a
most eccentric genius, on a small scale, who was at once architect,
manager, carpenter, scene-painter, decorator, machinist,
mechanician, and to crown all, a very passable comic actor.</p>

<p>What rendered this combination of talents more extraordinary,
Jemmy could neither read nor write, the only method he possessed of
learning his parts being to listen while another read them; and
though during these lessons the ever busy fingers of Manager King
would still be at work, perhaps in the discordant avocation of a
tinker, employed in making or mending the theatrical lamps, yet
none of the <i>corps dramatique</i> were more perfect at
rehearsal.</p>

<p>The theatre, as before stated, had few external charms. It was
formed only of slabs and bark; yet the interstices of the walls
being filled in with mud, and the whole of the interior whitewashed
with pipeclay, of which there was abundance near, it produced no
despicable effect by candlelight. The whole affair was under the
<i>benign patronage</i> of the superintendent, who bestowed upon
the performers many indispensables for their use. Of course, in New
South Wales, there was no lack of timber. The materials for the
walls of the edifice were thus easily procured, as were also those
for the very rude seats of the pit and boxes &mdash; for to no less
than the latter accommodation did the ambitious followers of
Thespis at Emu aspire &mdash; together with the framework of the
scenes.</p>

<p>The canvas necessary was obtained in fragments of bags,
prisoners&rsquo; duck clothing, bed ticks, etc., and painted in
distemper with pipeclay, charcoal and various coloured earths.
Lamps and candlesticks were fabricated from worn-out tin pots and
dishes by the never-failing hands of King. Materials to light the
theatre were supplied by voluntary contributions of the officials,
who, forming the <i>haut ton</i> of the establishment, received
candles, or oil, as part of their supply of rations from the
governmerit stores.</p>

<p>But the wardrobe! Oh, the wardrobe! No powers of language can
enable me to do justice to a description of the wardrobe.</p>

<p>In the first place, to survey &ldquo;King Artexomines&rdquo; in
the solemn extravaganza of <i>Bumbastes Furioso</i>: his glittering
crown was composed of odds and ends of tin and copper, brightly
furbished, most of it garnished with pieces of window glass set on
parti-coloured foils of a flowing wig fabricated of bits of
sheepskin, the wool being powdered with bone ashes; a gaudy fringe
of fur bedecked a regal mantle that in the days of its pristine
freshness had been a purple stiff cloak with cape and hood, and
belonging to &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; Row, the wife of the camp
constable; which splendid fur trimming had once covered a native
cat, in the glossy spotted coat of which <i>indulgent</i> observers
<i>might</i> detect a very faint resemblance to the imperial
ermine; and to complete the truly magnificent ensemble of this
august monarch, his boots of russet hue had assumed their present
form from the legs of an ancient pair of duck trousers, whilom the
property of Manager King, dyed to that colour by the juice of
wattle-bark.</p>

<p>The caput of the doughty &ldquo;General Bumbastes&rdquo; was
surmounted by a magnificent cocked scraper, the body of which was
pasteboard covered over with black cloth, once appertaining to the
skirts of the parson&rsquo;s coat, adorned with a floating forest
of feathers that waved gallantly in the breeze, the latter being
supplied at the expense of the barndoor cocks belonging to
Regentville, a host of whom had been denuded of their tails for
this purpose. The stalwart general&rsquo;s coat had once covered a
corporal of the guard; but the theatrical tailor having turned it,
and having with great difficulty procured a consignment of cast-off
copper lace and bullion from the military officers at Sydney, this
was newly furbished for the occasion, and now shone most
resplendently decorative on the brawny breast and shoulders of the
(pot?) valiant hero, whose unwhisperables of humble duck were clean
washed and fancifully braided in a most ingenious manner with
strips of old blue cloth. A pair of monstrous policeman&rsquo;s
boots, equipped with glittering <i>tin</i> spurs having rowells as
big round as dollars, ended the martial person of the ferocious
commander, who was, moreover, supplied with a sword that in point
of size might have done honour to old &ldquo;Bell the Cat&rdquo;
himself. The blade and guard were each composed of the very best
hoop-iron, well scoured and bright, however, and the sword knot, to
furnish which all the ragged silk handkerchiefs within a mile had
been laid under contribution, might have vied in size with the swab
of a 74-gun ship.</p>

<p>The rest of the <i>properties</i> of the theatre at Emu were of
a like description; but seen at night, and from a distance, they
appeared in the eyes of most of the beholders to be quite
faultless. True it is, the chiefest number of the audiences, being
composed of either the small settlers of the Nepean or their wives
and children, had no more exalted idea of theatrical splendour than
might be derived from the exhibitions of travelling mountebanks, or
at best a strolling company of comedians in a country barn.</p>

<p>But there were at times others among the spectators of the
humble attempts or the brethren of the sock and buskin: the then
Chief Justice, nay, the very representative of royalty himself,
having deigned to honour the Emu Theatre with their presence,
moved, it may be supposed, by the novelty of the thing, and a
desire to observe what kind of shifts could be made by men as
utterly destitute of all means and appliances as even their great
prototype Thespis, who first represented comedies in the early days
of Athens to his then rude countrymen, having only a waggon for a
stage and the sky for a canopy.</p>

<p>Visits such as these, of course, were hailed as great honours
and prepared for with corresponding anxiety. Ralph formed one of
the <i>corps</i> when it was honoured by a &ldquo;bespeak&rdquo;
from the Chief Justice, who was then residing at Regentville for
the vacation with all his family; and the Knight who owned that
spacious and wealthy estate, together with a perfect galaxy of the
&eacute;lite of Australian aristocracy, proposed to accompany his
illustrious visitor to the entertainment.</p>

<p>King having laid before the superintendent a list of the pieces
they were ready to represent, it was forwarded to Sir John, who
selected <i>Raymond and Agnes</i>, followed by <i>The Devil to
Pay</i>, for the evening&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p>Dire was now the turmoil among all the hangers-on in the
theatre, that structure, in the first place, requiring repairs, and
all the interior to be whitewashed and <i>redecorated</i>. The
scenery, too, and the dresses wanted a good deal of touching up.
Rehearsals must be had and the <i>properties</i> looked to.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that every one of them engaged in these
multifarious avocations had withal to labour in the fields at
different kinds of work from sunrise to sunset every week day save
Saturday, which could not, of course, be pitched upon, as it would
be inconvenient, on account of the lateness of the performance
encroaching on the hours of the Sabbath before the audience could
reach their respective abodes. The indefatigable King and his
trusty coadjutors worked nearly all the intervening nights with
great zeal, for to these stage-struck heroes it was truly a labour
of love.</p>

<p>By the time the period of representation had arrived, all was
prepared much to the satisfaction of the manager himself, who, upon
surveying the effect of his labours from the pit just after the
whole was <i>brilliantly</i> illuminated by four small lamps and
full <i>twelve</i> mould candles, rubbed his hands in an ecstasy,
and cried, &ldquo;<i>Well</i> now! <i>This is something</i>
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With palpitating hearts, partly through the haste of their
running home from work, partly through awe at the greatness of
their expected guests, did the assembled Company prepare for their
<i>d&eacute;but</i>, and precisely at seven o&rsquo;clock &mdash;
in newspaper phrase &mdash; the &ldquo;orchestra struck up an
overture&rdquo;. This <i>orchestra</i>, by the by, consisted of
four instruments, namely a violin &mdash; only so styled in the
theatre; elsewhere it received the humbler appellation of a fiddle
&mdash;; a flute, much akin to a fife in sharpness of tone; a
tambourine, profusely decorated with <i>tin jingles</i>, and the
handiwork of Manager King; and a huge drum, which owed its origin
to the same omni-capable personage, to whom must also be ascribed
all the honour and glory of fabricating the flute, and though last,
not least, the fiddle also &mdash; beg pardon, violin, I mean
&mdash; the material of which was King&rsquo;s great panacea, tin.
Tin served him in an infinity of ways; of it he made all sorts of
articles, swords and scabbards, spurs and spectacles, decorations
and diamonds.</p>

<p>But lo! the curtain now draws up, and the play begins. The
melodrama was received with rapturous applause by the unwashed
multitude who crowded the pit, and with better expressed
approbation by the occupants of the boxes; the only drawback to the
manager&rsquo;s satisfaction being that a number of the men
belonging to the camp, as there was no gallery, had taken
undisturbed possession of the roof, where they vented their
criticisms in rather an obstreperous manner, deaf to the
<i>dignified</i> remonstrances of the irritated Jemmy King, who
ever and anon devoted them to the <i>deis infernis</i> in
&ldquo;curses, not loud, but deep&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At length, the sweet symphony of the musicians failing to
extract any more plaudits from the auditory, it was judged time to
commence the after-piece, which also was received very courteously.
In fact, it went off well, but for one trifling incident, which,
however, luckily passed unnoticed by the audience, though it
elicited a series of grave rebukes from the manager. It was thus.
The representative of &ldquo;Jobson&rdquo;, having made rather free
with some wine which the Knight of Regentville had presented to the
performers to solace their thirst during their labours, was
somewhat too energetic in applying the stirrup-leather to the
shoulders of his sleeping partner &ldquo;Nell&rdquo;, whose
prototype on this occasion was a strapping young man of twenty-two,
and as Master &ldquo;Jobson&rdquo; observed his spouse for the
nonce winced somewhat under this application, he took a malicious
pleasure in repeating the dose when not required by the action of
the drama. At last the patience of the quondam &ldquo;Nell&rdquo;
being quite exhausted, he went close up to &ldquo;Jobson&rdquo;,
and shaking a fist as large as a moderate sized leg of mutton in
his face, said, <i>sotto voce</i> however, &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;
your eyes. If you do that again I&rsquo;ll knock your infernal head
off.&rdquo; Luckily, at this moment there was a slight noise in the
pit, which prevented the <i>words</i> being heard; but the natural
energy of the <i>gesture</i> which accompanied them elicited a loud
&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; from Sir John, which recalled the
recollection of the exasperated wight, or he might have proceeded
to put his threat into execution, as he was by no means a person to
stand upon trifles.</p>

<p>The performance concluded happily, and a respectful valedictory
address having been delivered by the manager, the company prepared
to depart. Prior to their doing so, however, the Chief Justice
requested that the performers be brought to the entrance before he
took his leave, in order that he might have an opportunity of
examining their disguises more closely. This request, of course,
from so exalted a personage assumed all the force of a command, and
in a few minutes the Company of actors was mustered in a double
line leading from the foot of the rude staircase to the entrance of
the theatre.</p>

<p>The superintendent led the way, followed by his visitors, among
whom were several ladies, who viewed the quasi-female performers
with unmixed amazement on discovering that the chief representative
of the softer sex on these primitive boards had, like Sir John
Falstaff in the dress of the cunning woman of Brentford, a most
unmitigated growth of whiskers, which the wearer valued so much
that he would on no account consent to the sacrifice of them, but
rather had contrived a head-dress with much art, the fastenings of
which served pretty well, at a distance, to conceal these very
unfeminine appendages to a female eye; but on a closer view the
quondam lady of the gallant Knight in the play was discovered to be
neither more nor less than a brawny bullock-driver, clad in attire
which, though perhaps it might once have decorated a duchess, yet,
if ever such was the case, its present dilapidated state and faded
glories distinctly told of its having been a very, very long time
before.</p>

<p>Nor was the astonishment of the gentlemen present much less, to
observe the many shifts which it now became apparent had been
resorted to in order to trick forth the male performers for the
purpose of enabling them to &ldquo;strut and fret their hour upon
the stage&rdquo; with something like dresses approximating to
fitting costume. In particular, Ralph Rashleigh&rsquo;s dress, as
conjuror, elicited the admiration of the Chief justice, who had
some difficulty in believing that the flowing wig which adorned his
head was made of so humble a material as sheepskin, which after
personal examination His Honour satisfied himself to be the case,
and remarking that &ldquo;necessity was the most fruitful parent of
invention&rdquo;, he returned the wig to its wearer, paying him, at
the same time, a well-deserved compliment upon his ingenuity, and
slipping a pound note unobserved into his hand, saying in a low
tone as he did so, &ldquo;For yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guests now departed, the Knight of Regentville and all his
party having expressed their high satisfaction at the
entertainment, and made such presents to the manager for the
Company as, with gifts more suited to their humble circumstances
made by other spectators, enabled that functionary to distribute a
share amounting to no less than ten shillings to each of the
musicians and fifteen shillings to the performers.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">These are thy blessings: Industry,
rough power,<br>
Whom labour still attends, and sweat, and pain.</p>

<p>As Rashleigh wsas returning from work one morning shortly after
the memorable &ldquo;bespeak&rdquo;, in company with one of the
pseudo-performers, he had to cross the highway road leading to
Bathurst over Emu Plains. It chanced that just as they did so, a
mounted traveller accosted them, who by his appointments had
evidently been no long time in the Colony, and who was struck, as
it would seem, with their appearance. The winter&rsquo;s supply of
clothing having been recently issued, each had on a frock and
trousers which were nearly new. These garments were somewhat
uncouth to look at, being merely the natural colour of the wool as
it was cut in the fleece, put together in a truly antediluvian
style which would have positively horrified the soul of a Stultz if
he could have only caught a glimpse of them, and rendered much more
conspicuous by the characters &ldquo;P-B-E-P&rdquo; each about six
inches long, stamped with glaring red paint in no less than eight
different places, before and behind each wearer. These letters were
meant to represent &ldquo;Prisoners&rsquo; Barracks Emu
Plains&rdquo;; but from the colour of the cloth, the utter
shapelessness of the clothes, and the brilliant contrast afforded
by the hue of the stamps, each person who wore this primitive garb
resembled some strange monster in a state of transition, scarce
half man but more than half sheep, branded, as it might appear
&mdash; having been newly shorn &mdash; with the initials of its
owner&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>So at least seemed to think the stranger, who checked his horse
and sat motionless in the saddle, gazing with dilated eyes and
gaping with open mouth at the long file of convicts as they passed.
Ralph and his companion being last, he addressed them as if he were
anxious to ascertain whether this were an unreal mockery of his
vision or whether they were palpable living men possessed of the
usual organs of speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We belong to the camp yonder,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; returned the stranger, &ldquo;and pray, what
sort of dress is that you wear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Government supply,&rdquo; replied Rashleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed; and now, if I may ask, what are the meanings of
all those letters sprinkled over it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why sir,&rdquo; answered Ralph&rsquo;s companion, who was
the small wit of Emu Plains, &ldquo;they mean &lsquo;Poor Beggar
&mdash; Eternal Punishment&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed the horseman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
very sorry for you!&rdquo; And he threw them a handful of silver,
which they gathered with great goodwill. And the stranger
departed.</p>

<p>Eighteen months had now elapsed since Ralph Rashleigh first
joined the agricultural establishment at Emu Plains, during which
period he had experienced full many an aching heart arid full many
an empty stomach. By far the greater part of that time he had
neither shirt nor shoes to wear. In fact, his only garments
consisted of a tattered frock of the kind just described and
scarcely three parts of a pair of unmentionables, so much patched
that, like the celebrated stockings of Sir John Cutler, hardly a
particle of the original material remained. The nether extremities
of these scanty apologies for decency looked as if his constant
nightly companions, the rats &mdash; who maintained almost an equal
right to his wretched bed of corn husks with himself &mdash; had
nibbled them away piecemeal, until at last they had encroached upon
those regions which ought to have covered the knees.</p>

<p>But the worst and most trying deprivation of all, to him, was
the lack of shoes. For in the fields the sharply angular masses of
clay, indurated almost to the hardness of flints by the arid sky,
produced painful stone bruises, while on the
&ldquo;burning-off&rdquo; ground or in the bush the frequent fires,
having consumed all the inflammable portions of the grass, left
nothing behind but the short stems, stiffened by flame, and as
sharp as pointed stakes, which pierced, cut and tore the soles of
his feet, until it was absolutely painful to him in the least
degree even to stand erect upon them. If he walked at all it was
necessarily at the rate of a snail&rsquo;s gallop, which procured
for him a double portion of abuse from his overseers and the
expressive but neither euphonious nor honourable appellation of a
<i>crawler</i>.</p>

<p>In the winter time, too, the torment produced by the hoar-frost,
which agonised his very soul whenever his lacerated feet came in
contact with it, produced many a bitter pang. But time enabled him
at last to find a remedy for even these evils. He invented a sort
of sandal similar to those of the Romans of old, the bottoms of
which were formed of light wood, having a complicated arrangement
of buckling straps to secure them. He also fabricated a kind of
stockings from old woollen rags, which served the double purpose of
warmth and security against thorns and briary vines which had so
cruelly mangled him before. Besides, and better than all this, he
was now getting so much inured to work that he no longer dreaded
it, nor had his hours of rest broken by frightful dreams of
cruelties perpetrated by the tyrannical overseers, as was too
frequently the case at first.</p>

<p>In addition to all these causes of self-gratulation afforded to
our exile, the drought which had so long oppressed the Colony broke
up in the ensuing spring, arid copious rains again blessed the
earth with their fertilising effects, dressing the surrounding
plains with nature&rsquo;s gayest livery &mdash; instead of the
arid appearance they had so long presented &mdash; and affording
promise of an abundant harvest to gladden the long depressed hearts
of the starving settlers. Besides, Rashleigh was now wealthy, his
store having been increased by the unexpected liberality of the
stranger to the sum of nearly two pounds &mdash; an amount which
promised, with due economy, to afford him a moderate supply of
extra food, sufficient to last him until the crops were ripe, when
he hoped to earn a further supply.</p>

<p>Time now coursed rapidly on, until the month of November, when
wheat reaping commenced. In compliance with an annual custom,
instituted in order to afford the free settlers opportunities of
acquiring additional labour to gather in their grain, which, in the
then very limited population of New South Wales, would otherwise
have been quite inaccessible, the superintendent of Emu Plains
granted passes to such of the men under him as he thought
deserving, each week upon Thursday evening; which documents
entitled the holders thereof to be absent from camp and to work for
themselves in the neighbourhood until the ensuing Sunday night
&mdash; an indulgence which was so highly appreciated that
<i>all</i> <i>hands</i> strained their nerves to the utmost to
obtain it.</p>

<p>Ralph was among the fortunates, and having gotten his
&ldquo;pass&rdquo;, with a merry heart and full of joyful
anticipations he hied across the river in search of work to do,
being accompanied by one of his hut-mates. About ten o&rsquo;clock
that night they reached a part of the Nepean bank which was thickly
occupied by small settlers, and where he had learned the wheat was
now nearly ripe. The yellow lustre of the harvest moon illumined
all the surrounding scenery with its mild radiance, and the hum of
many voices told that the settlers were busy.</p>

<p>Upon going nearer, the travellers soon found this to be the case
in good earnest, for it was a favourite as well as beneficial
practice with the Australian farmers of that day to perform the
greater part of their agricultural labours either by night or early
each morning, so that during the middle hours of the day, when the
sun was in its greatest altitude, they slept or amused themselves
in their dwellings. To do this with the greater advantage they
carefully studied the phases of the moon, being rather guided in
their hours of labour during the summer by that luminary than by
the too ardent god of day. Thus, when Rashleigh neared their
settlement, which stood upon the estate of Regentville and was
named &ldquo;Irish Corner&rdquo; after the nation of its chief
occupants, the greater part of the population were actively
employed. Men and women, boys and girls, all had sickles, reaping
away with the greatest energy, while ever and anon the jocund
laugh, the shouted jest and the merry response told that all were
engaged in an occupation they highly enjoyed.</p>

<p>The travellers, on reaching the first wheat field, waited at the
fence until the reapers came up, when they saluted the leader with
a good-night. He had not observed them, being absorbed in his work;
but he now stood up and returned their salute in kind, asking them
if they&rsquo;d far to travel.</p>

<p>Rashleigh responded &ldquo;that it depended on circumstances, as
they were looking for work&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my sowl, thin,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve come to the right place to find it! Praise be
to the Vargin! But maybe, though it&rsquo;s looking for work youse
are, yees don&rsquo;t want to do any yourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed we do,&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;if we can get anybody to
employ us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Employ yees? Gerrah, thin, why not?&rdquo; returned the
reaper. &ldquo;I suppose youse are all right? Not <i>crappies</i>
(bushrangers), I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; replied Rashleigh. &ldquo;I and my mate
here are men on pass from the Plains till Sunday. Here&rsquo;s our
passes if you like to look at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is id <i>me</i> look at &rsquo;em?&rdquo; responded the
other. &ldquo;Bedad thin, there ud be little good in <i>that</i>,
anyway; be the same token that I don&rsquo;t know big A from a
bud&rsquo;s foot!&rdquo; And he laughed most heartily at this
<i>highly</i> <i>delightful</i> idea. &ldquo;But if id&rsquo;s
raally raping you want, I&rsquo;ll give you a pound an acre for all
you&rsquo;ll cut of this saam whate. And if you&rsquo;ll take that,
jusht sthick in, and say no more about id.&rdquo; And the old man
again set to work, twisting the wheat down with surprising
vigour.</p>

<p>Ralph remarked, however, that this was a strong heavy crop and
worth more than that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be boddering us,&rdquo; said the owner.
&ldquo;Sure I can cut an acre a day of id <i>flankin</i>&rsquo;,
and I&rsquo;m sure hearty young min like the pair of youse ought to
knock down a dale more nor that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well,&rdquo; rejoined Rashleigh, we&rsquo;ll look about a bit
among your neighbours, and if we can&rsquo;t get any higher offer
we&rsquo;ll come and set on along with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this and by that thin, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
the choleric old chap. &ldquo;If you go sthreeling about looking
for more wages, you shan&rsquo;t touch a sthraw of Jack
Canavan&rsquo;s whate, see that now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, no harm done,&rdquo; returned the other, and
passed on a little farther.</p>

<p>In the next field they reached, there were five individuals
reaping, towards whom they went and found an elderly man somewhat
ahead of the others. Hard-favoured, long-sided, and still unbent by
age, the reaper raised himself up and said, &ldquo;Good morrow,
boys. Is id me you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;We want to know if you
can give us work with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bedad thin,&rdquo; rejoined the old man, &ldquo;I cud do
that saam, but what ud you be axing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going; but
we&rsquo;ll take the same as others get,&rdquo; replied the
travellers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Musha now,&rdquo; said the senior. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you at a word what I&rsquo;ll do. If you&rsquo;ll work along wid us
here, and work as we work, I&rsquo;ll pay you a pound for every day
you sthop; bekase, you see, my whate is rip&rsquo;ing all in
patches and I must rape wherever id&rsquo;s wanted to be cut firsht
and id &lsquo;udn&rsquo;t be convanient to mizzure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about our mess?&rdquo; said Ralph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrah thin, I forgot that. Why, if you plaze me,
I&rsquo;ll not charge you a traneen for all you&rsquo;ll ate of the
besht of good living, such as I&rsquo;ve got myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On these terms a bargain was struck, and as by this time the
other reapers had worked up to the foremost, they were directed to
&ldquo;side over&rdquo; into the standing wheat, and each of the
new-comers being provided with a sickle, to it they went right
earnestly, the old man keeping the lead, Ralph&rsquo;s mate nearest
to him, then one of the others, and next Ralph himself.</p>

<p>The reapers on either side of Rashleigh were slim and agile in
figure, the only dresses they wore apparently being shirts, made
very long certainly, and hats. Neither of them &mdash; not
excepting the old man &mdash; had shoes on, yet they swept along
over the clods and stubble with a celerity that compelled Ralph, to
use a colonial phrase, &ldquo;to hit out from the muscle&rdquo;,
that he might not be left behind. For two hours they wrought in
silence, till at length, observing a cessation among his preceding
partners, the former looked up and saw the old man leaning over the
fence apparently in a deep yarn with his mate. In a few minutes
Ralph had also cut up to the fence, when he stood erect, to take
breath and wipe the perspiration from his face.</p>

<p>The old man, now noticing him, said, &ldquo;Bedad, my lad, you
and your mate done well. We&rsquo;ll soon cut all that&rsquo;s
ready at this rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remainder of the <i>field</i> (persons reaping) having now
come up to the fence, the old man observed to Ralph&rsquo;s
amazement, &ldquo;Now, gals, you and these two young men had better
bind up what&rsquo;s cut while the dew&rsquo;s on it and lave it
laying there. We&rsquo;ll put it together in the daylight, and
I&rsquo;ll go and help the old woman get something ready for
breqquest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph now looked closely at the person who was standing next
him, and though there were few feminine charms in her countenance,
he could see enough to convince him that this hard-working reaper
who had made him use such expedition to keep up with her was really
nothing but a girl of at most thirteen, but even at that age nearly
as tall as himself. The old man turned away as he spoke, and Ralph,
with his companions, began to bind the sheaves where they lay, each
going down the rows they had cut during the night. This, not being
a very arduous task, admitted of conversation, and presently they
were as intimate as if they had known each other for years.</p>

<p>There was no affected squeamishness or reserve among these
unsophisticated children of nature. In reply to queries from their
male companions, the latter discovered they were working for a man
known on the river as &ldquo;Big Mick&rdquo;, who had a family of
six daughters and no son, all his male children having died in
infancy. It was said that soon after the birth of Mick&rsquo;s
third daughter he was lamenting to his wife their want of a son to
help him in his labours on the &ldquo;farrum&rdquo;, when his
strong-minded helpmate interrupted him by saying, &ldquo;Gerrah,
why, what are you boddering about? If I don&rsquo;t make my
<i>darters</i> better <i>min</i> than one half the crathurs I see
crawling about the counthry-side, by the Jakus, I&rsquo;ll ate
&rsquo;em every one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In conformity with this resolution, from their earliest infancy
each member of the family was employed to do whatever her strength
would permit. The very youngest of all was set to mind the pigs,
that they came not near the cultivation to do mischief, then
promoted to pull suckers from corn or tobacco. As they advanced in
years they took to the tools of manual labour nearly as soon as
they could lift them.</p>

<p>The effects of this course of education were now to be observed
upon all of them, for either of the girls could cut down the
largest tree in the bush with an axe as readily as most men, or do
a man&rsquo;s share at breaking up new ground with the hoe, driving
a team of bullocks, threshing wheat or maize, reaping, or in short
any other agricultural occupation. Nor was Mick&rsquo;s family a
solitary instance of this. Many others at that early period, when
labour was so very scarce in the Colony, bred their female children
in the same way. When there were several daughters, as in the
present case, one usually remained at home, alternately, to assist
the mother in her necessary domestic duties; which was, in fact,
all the chance they had of learning aught that would be serviceable
to them when they got married and had houses of their own to mind.
As it was, though they might, each and all, be able to sew, so as
to mend their own clothes or those of their male relations, and
bake a <i>damper</i> in the ashes &mdash; the usual method of
preparing bread in the interior of Australia-or make ready the
humble meals of the family, yet it was far more common to meet a
young woman &mdash; in other parts besides Irish Corner &mdash; who
could reap her acre of wheat a day than one who could make a
shirt.</p>

<p>Thus masculine in their labours, their persons were scarcely
less so. Though their features, in numberless instances, might be
considered positively handsome, as are in fact the general race of
fair Australians, yet exposure to the sun and wind completely
tanned them and gave them a weatherbeaten tinge in their youth;
while their forms, unrepressed by any confinement of clothing,
acquired all those ungainly attributes which characterise the
clown. But the chief marvel of all was the astonishing size of
their feet, for never using shoes in their childhood, and being
always in motion, those extremities obtained a most portentous
development, a fact which may be guessed at from the following
trivial circumstance.</p>

<p>Ralph one day subsequently was asked by the old man to fetch him
his shoes. He went to the hut for this purpose and returned with a
pair he had found on the floor which were much larger than his own.
As he had not seen any other member of the family adopt such
encumbrances he naturally concluded they were the right articles.
But on reaching the threshing-floor, which as usual stood in the
open air, and where all the family were then employed, he soon
found out he had made a mistake, for Mick burst out into a
horse-laugh and Said, &ldquo;Arrah now, by my sowl, if that
don&rsquo;t bate Banagher! And all the world knows Banagher bates
the Divil. If he hasn&rsquo;t brought me Nancy&rsquo;s little
brogueens (small shoes) instead of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh stared at Nancy, who was a girl about eleven years of
age, and she came over laughing to claim her shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother you,&rdquo; said her sire good-humouredly,
&ldquo;how foolish and fashionable you get! Must be claning your
brogueens every week now! I&rsquo;ll engage you are looking out for
some sweetheart or other to put the come &lsquo;ether over wid your
capers and clane shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sally over, he directed the girl to go and try could she
find the right brogues; and as Nancy tripped off on her errand,
Rashleigh had lots of opportunities to observe that large as the
shoes were, they were likely by no means to be a loose fit for her
feet.</p>

<p>Then, too, their out-of-door life rendered them excessively rude
and boisterous, of which Ralph heard a laughable instance some time
after.</p>

<p>A person with whom Big Mick had a dealing, after the business
was concluded, produced a case-bottle of rum from his saddle-pack,
vowing that they&rsquo;d have a <i>dram</i> together to wet the
bargain, and down they sat very seriously to discuss the drink. Now
the stranger was a person of some little means and a shrewd, keen
chap withal, who had got a few cattle and a couple of good brood
mares, which were then quite a fortune. So Mick, after a few
<i>balls</i> had opened his heart and his temper, began to think it
would be no bad spec. to interest his guest in one of his
daughters. Could he persuade him to take one as a wife, why, she
would be, in his own expression, &ldquo;a made girl for
ever&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Urged by this idea, he began a long eulogium upon the beauty and
numberless good qualities of his girls. After a time, getting
warmed by the theme, and a little piqued, it may be also, at the
stoicism of his companion, who only opened his oracular jaws to
emit the smoke of his <i>dhudeen</i>, he said that he could afford
a smart penny to portion each of the gals, so that it would by no
means be a bad chance for anybody &ldquo;that ud know how to trate
a dacent wife&rdquo; when they got her. Still this did not produce
the wished-for effect upon the insensible mind of Mick&rsquo;s
companion, and at last the old man broadly hinted to him,
&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s a shame for you that you don&rsquo;t look
out for some good little crathur to be keeping house for you, and
not be living all your days like a solunthary bacheleer.&rdquo; And
he wound up by saying that his guest should see the darlin&rsquo;s
and judge for himself.</p>

<p>Upon this they adjourned to the outside of the dwelling, where
the old man gave a loud <i>cooay</i> as a signal for his daughters
to return home from their work. Both the men now gazed in the
direction from which they expected the girls to appear, when lo!
shouting, laughing, and tearing obstreperously along, the six
beauteous and dutiful damsels came racing towards them.
Disconcerted at this novel mode of introducing a bride-elect, no
sooner did the stranger see this troop of Bacchantes sweeping over
the newly ploughed ground at this rate, than he bolted to his horse
and cried, &ldquo;Goodbye, Mick! I might as well marry a whirlwind
as one of thim wild divils. Why, the fastest mare I&rsquo;ve got ud
never be able to catch her!&rdquo; And he rode off at speed,
pursued by loud shouts of &ldquo;Ahoo! Ahoo!&rdquo; from the young
<i>ladies</i> and peals of laughter from the merry old man.</p>

<p>After Ralph and his companions had finished tying up the sheaves
that lay cut on the ground, they adjourned to Mick&rsquo;s
dwelling, which originally consisted only of two small apartments,
with sundry additions made to it at various times, abutting from
one or the other side in divers singularly ugly excrescences, with
lean-to roofs resting against that of the parent edifice. All these
structures were composed of the then unvarying materials of
Australian architecture in the interior &mdash; slabs or thin
pieces split off by means of mauls and wedges from logs, the roof
covered with forest box or stringy-bark, which was stripped from
the living trees in sheets of about six feet long and from two to
four feet wide, laid upon rafters composed of small sapling poles
just as they came from being cut in the bush. The sheets of bark,
having holes pierced through each in pairs, were then tied on the
rafters with cords twisted of the inner rind of the kurrajong tree.
The whole framing of the roof was secured as it was needed by
wooden pins in order to save the expense of nails, which were then
both too scarce and too dear to be used by the lower order of
settlers.</p>

<p>Indeed, all kinds of ironwork were equally inaccessible, and
instead of hinges to tie doors or window shutters, those
appurtenances were all made to revolve on wooden pivots in holes,
bored a short distance into the corresponding parts of the
frames.</p>

<p>Thus the materials of Mick&rsquo;s habitation were pretty much
the same as those of the prisoners&rsquo; huts on Emu Plains; but
the chinks in the slab walls of the former were well stopped up
with plaster made of cow dung and sand. A bark ceiling also was
laid over the tie-beams which, while it prevented the dust from
pouring down in such torrents through the interstices of the roof,
also afforded a convenient loft for the storage of pumpkins and
many other articles of domestic consumption. Besides these
indications of comfort, the whole of the inside had been newly
whitewashed &mdash; that is, <i>only</i> the Christmas before,
though in the eleven months which had intervened the volumes of
smoke which continually rolled through every cranny of the place
had somewhat tarnished the virgin purity of its hue, converting it
at length into a whity-brown yellow; yet even <i>that</i> colour
was better than none.</p>

<p>As usual, the fireplace occupied nearly the whole of one end of
the hut, and being composed entirely of wood, the danger of its
igniting had been diminished by hard dried clods of clay built up
about a couple of feet high round its interior and laid in a sort
of mortar also composed of clay tempered with water to a
semi-liquid consistency. On the sides of the ample fireplace were
constructed rough seats for the winter nights, above which might be
seen store of pieces of salted beef and pork, pigs&rsquo; heads,
bags of cabbage and pumpkin seeds, and a multitude of other
articles which required to be kept dry, this being by courtesy
considered the most secure part of the dwelling from the incursions
of rain. There was no possibility of any leakage, <i>except</i>
from the top, which was not <i>more</i> than two feet square, and
left quite open in the fond hope of persuading or enticing the
smoke to go out there instead of continually struggling for passage
through the crevices of the bark roof or pouring out in volumes at
the ever open doors and windows. But such was the perversity of
this obstinate element that it too generally preferred any illicit
vent to the legal one and very frequently asserted its supremacy in
such a manner as effectually to drive the inmates out of doors
altogether, for sheer lack of breath to continue the contest any
longer. As this generally took place in very wet weather, when a
fire could not be maintained out of doors, as was the usual summer
custom, and besides, the chilliness rendering it acceptable in the
house for its warmth, it may be conceived that the piety of the
inmates, at no time very conspicuous, was not vastly enhanced by
their having to stand in the rain, perforce, in order to escape
suffocation, until it pleased the vaporous enemy to allow them a
short respite by retiring to the loft or any other part of the
premises, <i>except</i> the chimney of course, which it appeared
most of all places to shun.</p>

<p>The furniture was truly of a primitive cast. A number of tin
pint pots and dishes, half a dozen three-legged cast-iron boilers
of various sizes, a long-handled frying-pan, a few rough stools,
mostly fixed on stumps sunk in the floor, two or three short round
blocks of wood cut off trees with a cross-cut saw to serve as
movable seats, and two stationary tables made of unplaned slabs,
one fixed in the centre and the other on one side, completed the
accommodation of the outer apartment.</p>

<p>When the doors of any of the sleeping-rooms admitted a view of
their contents, it did not appear that luxury was by any means the
besetting sin of either Big Mick or his family. The sleeping-berths
were all fixtures, made of slabs and sheets of bark, only the one
belonging to the father and mother being furnished with any attempt
at curtains, which for economy&rsquo;s sake were confined to the
foot of the bed and one side. The berth being fixed in a corner,
all was thus enclosed, partly by the slabs and partly by the
curtain, which exactly answered the description given by Pope of
those &ldquo;in the worst inn&rsquo;s worst room&rdquo;, being tied
with tape and never meant to draw; instead of which, the blue
striped shirting of which it was composed was secured back by loops
and buttons which hung them partly aside and exposed to view a
tattered patchwork quilt, apparently innocent of the washing-tub
since its formation.</p>

<p>The effeminacy of sheets was unknown to any of the inmates.
Though they obtained abundance of feathers, which when plucked from
the birds on which they grew, were suffered to lie on the spot
where they fell until dispersed by the winds, when they sailed
about in all directions, a positive nuisance, yet each of the
family slept on beds of chaff contained in rough ticks, many of
which, being the worse for wear, suffered their contents to escape
through their numberless orifices, when it littered the earthen
floor. Being scattered thence into unknown corners, where brooms
never penetrated, the rubbish proved fruitful nurseries of
&ldquo;flaas&rdquo;, to the extreme annoyance of the good matron of
the house, who strove in vain to abate it by repeated libations of
water, until <i>mud</i> was by no means a scarce article, either
within or without the domicile.</p>

<p>To this habitation Rashleigh and his mate now received a
&ldquo;kindly welcome&rdquo; from both the old man and the woman,
and a plentiful supply of salt beef, damper bread and pumpkins
being spread on the table, they all fed most heartily, washing down
the feast with bumpers of tea out of the tin pots before named.
When they had done, a short interval being allowed them to smoke a
pipe each, they again sallied forth to work.</p>

<p>It was now dawn, and they continued to reap until about nine
o&rsquo;clock, when they returned to the hut, partook of another
meal like the former, and then all retired to rest. Ralph and his
companion, having obtained a couple of blankets and directions to a
corner of the loft where lay a large heap of corn husks, slept
soundly until about four o&rsquo;clock, and then to work again.</p>

<p>In this way, making about fifteen hours at work out of each
twenty-four, they both completed three and a half working days of
ten hours each by Sunday night, when, having received their money
and thanks from Big Mick, with pressing requests to come again
whenever they could get leave, the reapers returned to Emu Plains
and gave up their passes to the camp constable, after which they
retired to rest, to prepare for another week&rsquo;s work for
Government.</p>

<p>In this way the harvest passed over. Twice more did Rashleigh
obtain a pass, and each time was employed by his old patron Big
Mick.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14" id=

<p align="center" class="note">Base is the slave that
pays<i>.</i></p>

<p>A number of the settlers having preferred a request to that
effect, the whole of the &ldquo;play actors&rdquo; of Emu Plains
received permission to go with all their paraphernalia to perform a
play at a distant part of the Nepean settlement.</p>

<p>Proud was the manager, great was the bustling importance of the
Company, and by the first light of the day appointed, the
&ldquo;scenery, machinery, dresses and decorations&rdquo; of the
Emu Theatre having been transferred to a settler&rsquo;s dray, all
were <i>en route</i> to the scene of action &mdash; a large barn
belonging to the keeper of a very small inn, who had <i>kindly</i>
lent the edifice for this purpose; of course, solely for the
amusement of his neighbours, without the slightest expectation of
prospective advantage to himself. Notwithstanding his disinterested
feelings, however, after the <i>corps dramatique</i> had been hard
at work for a couple of hours, Boniface, rubbing his hands, came in
to the quondam theatre and expressed his admiration in glowing
terms of all that he saw, winding up a most flowery speech by
enquiring whether it was not a <i>dry job</i>, at the same time
hinting obliquely at the excellent qualities of a beverage composed
of good rum and peach cider, of both which his stock was immense,
adding that as no doubt the performance would amply remunerate the
Company, he would not object to supplying the members thereof with
refreshment for the day on credit, always providing his account
should be liquidated as soon as the play was over.</p>

<p>These terms having been joyfully acceded to by, the thirsty
Thespians, a sample of the much-vaunted drink was obtained, and
although it was not quite equal to nectar &mdash; as the cider was
something of the sharpest, and the rum rather peppery &mdash; yet
to men from Emu Plains it appeared very superior. About noon, too,
a servant came, who in the name of her master, the inn keeper
enquired if any of the players wanted dinner. Accordingly, all
adjourned to the kitchen, where salt beef and pork, abundance of
greens, and the unvarying damper awaited their appetites. This
<i>sumptuous feast</i> was duly crowned by libations, though sooth
to say, the tender care of their host prevented their getting
drunk, because the rum, though very pungent and very hot, was also
very weak, being, in nautical phrase, only equal to three-water
grog, and thus did not disturb the acting powers of even the most
weak-headed among the theatricals.</p>

<p>The performances of the evening having closed amid rapturous
applause, a good jollification was resolved on. But alas, as Burns
has sung,</p>

<p><i>The best-laid schemes o&rsquo; mice and men</i><br>
<i>Gang aft agley</i>.</p>

<p>All unforeseen difficulty arose; the innkeeper insisted on
payment of his bill before any fresh supplies were afforded. On
examination of this ingenious document, it appeared each performer
owed him one pound two shillings and sixpence for drink, dinner and
supper, both of these repasts being charged at three shillings per
head, and the remainder made up of <i>pints</i> of rum,
<i>gallons</i> of cider, and <i>ditto, ditto</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
almost without end. Now, as is customary in such cases, the debtors
could not by any process be brought to believe that they had
actually obtained even half the liquor charged against them, and
the obdurate creditor vowed most solemnly that he had served the
whole of it himself. To add to the mischief, it was found on
investigation, that after paying a few trifling claims for nails
and other minor incidental expenses, the receipts would but admit
of a dividend of thirty shillings to each principal player in the
Company and the stipulated wages of the supernumeraries &mdash;
scene-shifters and others.</p>

<p>Indeed, as each man&rsquo;s share of the bill was alike, the
Company actually owed more than their gross receipts; but on this
being explained, the landlord at length agreed to take what the
lower rate of performers obtained in full from them, if the others
would cash up the amount of his claim on each of these. Further, he
said he thought himself and the chief constable might persuade
their superintendent to let the Company remain where they were and
play again one more night; which he kindly volunteered to do, and
in the mean time &mdash; always after a settlement &mdash; would
let the Thespians go on again with a fresh score, on the faith of
their next night&rsquo;s receipts.</p>

<p>This arrangement being at once acceded to, the
<i>disinterested</i> landlord received instantly by far the greater
portion of the collection made by the theatrical treasurer, and
then the Company began again to enjoy themselves, free from the
<i>dreadful</i> thoughts of the reckoning, which was thus
procrastinated twenty-four hours, at any rate. The next morning,
betimes, Manager King called a council of his trusty coadjutors and
opened to them a most brilliant device of his own composition, by
which he doubted not to astonish the natives in general, and none
more so than their <i>kind confiding</i> host in particular, who
had been so fluent of his beverage and so cunning with his chalk;
this notable plan was to be put into execution at the close of the
evening&rsquo;s amusement and was rapturously acceded to by his
fellow-convicts, who deemed it would form a most appropriate finale
to the amusements of the night.</p>

<p>They now partook of breakfast; and after a couple of glasses of
grog by way of stimulus to repair the ravages made by their last
night&rsquo;s jollificationtion in the sensorium of each, the most
eloquent of the performers were dispatched in small parties to make
a circuit of the settlers dwelling near, exhibiting in each house a
play-bill, to compose which Rashleigh had exhausted nearly all his
powers of persuasive oratory, in setting forth the magnitude of
<i>that</i> night&rsquo;s attractions at their temporary theatre,
enumerating the various points of allurement quite as
grandiloquently as a London manager of a minor theatre, and winding
up with the <i>awful</i> annunciation that it was <i>most
positively</i> their last exhibition at that place. The ambassadors
were also commissioned to explain to the expected guests such
reasons good as compelled them to believe the last assertion,
namely, that the passes of the histrionic heroes would expire that
day.</p>

<p>Rashleigh, backed by a new and youthful recruit, whose beardless
face well suited the female parts he sustained, made his rounds,
meeting with many promises of attendance and much rude hospitality
from all the small settlers round about. This was a period of most
universal merriment, indeed, a sort of prescriptive saturnalia in
society of that sort every year, but doubly so upon this occasion,
when the agriculturists, for the first time in seven years, were
blessed with overflowing garners teeming with grain. In every hut,
therefore, was then to be found a keg, filled, not with choice
Jamaica, but with its fiery prototype from Bengal; and mirth and
revelry was the order of both day and night.</p>

<p>Evening drew nigh as they returned to their companions, when the
manager announced to our adventurer that all was prepared for the
successful <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the preconcerted plot to
form the finale of the night; and after each had partaken of a
refreshment, it was time to dress for the play.</p>

<p>An early hour had been fixed upon for commencing, because, it
being Saturday night, they wished the whole bill of fare, which was
rather a long one, should be gone through before midnight. The barn
&mdash; beg pardon, theatre &mdash; was crammed to over-flowing;
many, who would not be turned away, were accommodated on the roof;
and each new <i>point</i> elicited rapturous bursts of applause.
But as soon as every thing was done with, either of the scenery or
of the <i>valuable properties</i>, it was slyly and noiselessly
withdrawn through an opening, which had been clandestinely
contrived in the slabs of the barn; and at last, when the
drop-scene fell, Manager King was the only performer left in the
house. All the others had followed their paraphernalia, which, as
it was removed, had been placed in a dray hired for the purpose,
and kept concealed at a short distance, among some swamp oaks in a
dell by the riverside, where the whole party now waited with
impatience the arrival of their manager.</p>

<p>That eloquent personage, among whose other attributes was a most
fluent &ldquo;gift of the gab&rdquo;, and who was not at all
annoyed at any opportunity of exhibiting his oratory, amused the
audience fully a quarter of an hour by his facetious farewells,
returning thanks for the <i>distinguished</i> <i>honour</i> of
their <i>patronage</i>, etc. Finally, perceiving a movement towards
the door on the part of some impatient persons who wished to be at
home, Manager King, amid a profusion of bows that would have done
honour to a dancingmaster, each too, in accordance with approved
theatrical taste, much lower than its predecessor, himself at
length withdrew through the aperture before mentioned, carefully
closing it after him, and leaving to the landlord, in liquidation
of his claim, the drop-scene &mdash; which, by the by, was so
foully abused by its antiquity that it had long been laid aside as
condemned, even at the Emu Theatre &mdash; and about a dozen rough,
battered tin sconces, with the ends of candle they contained. These
were all the available assets they resigned to their creditor in
satisfaction of his demand for the previous night&rsquo;s
festivity, their meals that day, and an awful accumulation of
<i>lush</i> supplied these runagates by their too confiding host
during the last twentyfour hours.</p>

<p>Boniface, who was himself in the theatre at the close of the
performance, had vigilantly assisted the money-taker at the door,
kindly volunteering his services, not only to prevent any from
evaporating without payment, but also, by jocular railleries and
reproofs of their stinginess, to stimulate those who did offer cash
to exert unwonted liberality. After all the auditory had departed,
the landlord remained near the orchestra, in patient expectation of
the advent of the performers from behind the scenes. As there was
no other outlet from thence &mdash; that he knew of &mdash; he made
himself certain they must pass by him before they could leave the
scene of their histrionic display, and probably the worthy Knight
of the Spiggot consoled himself by casting up the &ldquo;tottle of
the whole&rdquo;, as Mr Hume would say, and jingling imaginary
coins in his breeches pockets, to be derived from the proceeds of
the theatrical treasurer, whose harvest he was certain, from ocular
demonstration, must have been a pretty productive one.</p>

<p>At length, however, finding the actors did not make their
appearance, and hearing no sound emanate from their supposed
retreat, the profound stillness of the whole theatre forming, too,
a complete contrast to the merry shouts of jolly Bacchanalians whom
he could hear noisily revelling away at his own house &mdash; which
incident also demanded his early attention, in order that he might
assist in the operations of his trusty coadjutors of the rum-keg
&mdash; the landlord clambered over the rails which divided the
orchestra from the pit, climbed upon the temporary stage, lifted
the ragged curtain, and, after an awful pause, plucked up heart of
grace and boldly entered the sanctum sanctorum of the sons of
Thespis.</p>

<p>Here the bewildered Boniface could scarcely credit the evidence
of his eyes. By the almost expiring rays of a single morsel of
candle end, he could see neither scenery nor actors, and what
puzzled him more, he could by no means conceive how they had
contrived to get out, as there was then no opening whatever
visible; and he at last well-nigh decided in his mind that they
must be conjurors as well as comedians. Brimful of wrath, he
hastened to his home to institute enquiries, which, it is almost
needless to add, proved all in vain. Not one of the many persons
there knew which way the fugitives had fled, and the advanced hour,
with the darkness of the night, rendered pursuit at that moment
hopeless. Vowing bitter vengeance against these delinquents, whom
he stigmatised as monsters of most odious ingratitude, the irate
man of reckonings was reluctantly compelled to bottle up his anger
as well as he could for the present and defer until daylight any
ulterior measures.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Manager King and his hopeful squad had pursued
their journey merrily, keeping down in a grassy valley, where the
turf offered no noisy impediments to their progress, until they
reached one of the many rapids, or falls, in that part of the
Nepean, which are often crossed by such wayfarers as eschew the
payment of puntage. Here they waded the stream, and having gone but
a little distance along the opposite bank, called a halt in a
little sunken spot that promised to prevent their fire from
attracting the attention of any wanderers. There they kindled a
blazing flame and began to busy themselves in preparing a feed, the
basis of which, I regret to record, had been procured from the
victimised host under the pretence of a stage supper necessary in
the course of their night&rsquo;s performance, but which &mdash;
with near two gallons of his much extolled <i>beverage</i> that
they had secreted and brought with them to do honour to the
occasion &mdash; had not been paid for as yet; and indeed, to say
truth, if the wills of those about to consume it were to be
consulted, the payment for the whole was like enough to be
procrastinated <i>ad graecas kalendas</i>.</p>

<p>Here hilarity prevailed to an unusual extent, the staple fun
with which their jokes were seasoned being all levelled at the
luckless landlord; and many most witty conjectures were hazarded as
to the length, breadth and depth of the astonishment which that
<i>worthy</i> and <i>liberal</i> soul would exhibit upon making the
disagreeable discovery that he had been so deeply <i>done</i>. The
performers did not drink much, however, as they conjectured that
mine host would make his complaint to their commandant, and they
wished to appear before that awful officer in full possession of
all their powers of reason.</p>

<p>About sunrise they arrived at home, and having unloaded their
<i>valuable</i> effects, each man prepared himself as best he might
for the approaching interview. Manager King &mdash; who in this, as
in all things else, took the lead &mdash; promising to stand
spokesman on the occasion. About seven o&rsquo;clock the landlord
made his appearance, accompanied by the chief constable, who,
however, could scarcely conceal his merriment at the lugubrious
tale, told with such unwonted energy, by the suffering subject of
the &ldquo;pla&rsquo;actors&rsquo;&rdquo; peculations.</p>

<p>The landlord made his <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to the theatre, where
he discovered Manager King, dressed in his full suit of Sunday
slops, lying apparently asleep in his berth. And that worthy
certainly performed the part of one just awakened, to a miracle;
for when the visitor enquired what he meant by running away without
paying the debt incurred by the Company, jemmy King yawned heavily
once or twice, then affected great anger at being so
unceremoniously aroused, and at length gave the complainant very
deliberately to understand that <i>he</i>, for one, thought the
players had already paid dear enough for all that they had received
from him; and further, if the landlord expected any more money from
them, why, he must get it the best way he could.</p>

<p>On this the other burst out into indignant exclamations against
such excessive ingratitude, saying, however, that he expected no
less; and at last he started off to lay his lamentation before the
superintendent, from whom he confidently expected both redress and
sympathy. In a few moments a summons arrived for all the <i>corps
dramatique</i> to attend that awe-inspiring official, and being
quickly arranged in his sight, he demanded what they had to say for
themselves in reply to this charge of fraud.</p>

<p>King, after apologizing for occupying the time of his superior,
told all the history of the first day&rsquo;s proceedings, laying
particular emphasis upon the overcharges made by the landlord, as
they appeared on the first bill, winding up his oration by a
reference to the second account, and appealing to the
superintendent whether he thought it at all possible the men then
present, who, it was perfectly evident, were unaccustomed to the
use of any intoxicating drinks, could have consumed the quantities
of spirits charged against them in the space of about thirty-six
hours, and still preserve their sobriety, so as to enable them to
play both the nights, some of them sustaining three different parts
on each &mdash; which, he submitted, it would have been quite
impossible for them to do if they had even drunk half the liquor
the landlord now sought to make them pay for.</p>

<p>The great man seemed rather struck with this defence, and on
examining both bills, could not but admit the accuracy of
King&rsquo;s argument. Then, observing that the meals had been
charged at three shillings each person, he asked of what viands
they consisted; and the homely qualities of the several repasts
being asserted by King and admitted by mine host, the
superintendent told the latter he could not help thinking that part
of the charge too dear by half; and as for the rest of his claim,
he (the superintendent) could not believe the men had drunk all the
grog stated, because each person&rsquo;s share would in his opinion
make, and keep, any ordinary individual drunk at least for a week,
and yet those who the landlord stated had consumed it all in a day
and a half now stood before them, apparently as sober as if they
had never tasted anything stronger than water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; concluded the chief, &ldquo;if
you request it, I will order the whole of them to be brought before
the bench of magistrates, to answer any charge you may think fit to
prefer against them. But I&rsquo;d recommend you to remember that
there is an Act of Council in force, imposing a fine of five
dollars for each offence in serving a convict with spirits; so
that, perhaps, you might lose more by taking them to Court than you
would clear by making them pay, even if you gained your case, which
seems rather doubtful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In brief, after all, the landlord was compelled to give the
business up for a bad job, and console himself by reflecting that
what with his first overcharge, and what the audience assembled
through means of the performance had expended at his house, he was
in the whole a gainer, instead of a loser, by the brothers of the
buskin; though he often vowed he never had been so
&ldquo;willainously wictimised&rdquo; before in all his life.</p>

<p>This was the last occurrence of any note in Rashleigh&rsquo;s
time at Emu Plains; for the two years having now expired to which
his stay was limited at first, he was one morning kept back from
work, and informed that he had been assigned to the service of one
Mr Arlack of Bunbury Curran, since called Airds, and having
received directions for his journey, and a pass for his protection,
he departed after taking a friendly farewell of his quondam
companions belonging to the play-house hut at Emu Plains.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">He goes to a tint and he spends his
half-crown;<br>
He mates wid a frind and for love &mdash; Knocks him down.</p>

<p>It was a glorious spring morning when Ralph Rashleigh turned his
back upon the scene of his late sufferings with a light heart. The
charms of nature tended to delight him, and the soothing
anticipations of hope promised him, at least, a much more
comfortable home than the one he had quitted; and he plodded gaily
on, albeit his whole stock of earthly chattels, besides the clothes
he wore, were contained in a very small cotton handkerchief. Still,
he considered himself positively comfortable for a convict, as he
had a stout pair of boots, a whole pair of trousers, a new straw
hat, and the magnificent stock of <i>four</i> shirts, besides a
black silk handkerchief on his neck, and a tidy blue jacket to his
back. He was also possessed of four pounds and upwards in currency
money, and this sum in his present circumstances appeared a mint of
treasure.</p>

<p>After he had passed the river and its clustering settlers, he
journeyed through bypaths across the bush and was soon deeply
immersed in the almost twilight gloom of an Australian forest,
where the deepest silence ever prevails. No warbling choristers
here greet the merry morn with jocund flights of song. No lowing of
herds or bleating of flocks awakes the slumbering echoes. The
feathered tribes are here entirely mute or only utter either
discordant screams or brief harsh twittering. The solitary bellbird
chiefly, whose voice may he heard sometimes, disturbs the primeval
solitude with its single sharp note, which resounds through the
grove with so great a resemblance to a sheep bell that it requires
a practised ear to detect the difference between the bird and the
reality.</p>

<p>Animated nature here appears to slumber, for not a single living
thing can be seen, except at rare intervals, when a gaudily-marbled
goanna of great size may perhaps hurry on his spiral route up a
tree to avoid the approaching foot of man, or perchance, a snake
may glide hastily across his path, the glittering colours of its
skin, in its convolutions, chiefly attracting the eye by their
brilliant contrast with the faded dull brown herbage or the dead
leaves among which it rustics in its sinuous way. No kangaroo, emu
or other larger fowl or animal may be seen; &rsquo;tis too near the
busy haunts of man, while on the other hand, the domesticated
quadrupeds are not found, because this forms part of a large
settler&rsquo;s grant. He has got no stock in this neighbourhood;
yet will he not allow his poorer neighbour&rsquo;s single cow to
subsist upon the grass, which annually springs, comes to maturity,
is parched to dust by the winds of summer and blown away by the
breath of autumn.</p>

<p>Over such a forest tract as this Ralph pursued his way until
noon, when, arriving at a pond of water and feeling both tired and
hungry, he halted, procured fire by means of his tinder-box, made
some tea by boiling it in a quart pot he carried with him, and ate
some food he had provided. He next prepared his pipe and lay in
luxurious ease upon the grass enjoying the <i>dolce far niente</i>
until he fell asleep; and when he again awoke, by the altered
position of the sun he thought it must be after three o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon. He now started up and re-pursued his journey,
still alone.</p>

<p>Since he had left the settlement on the banks of the Nepean he
had not seen a single human being, nor could he be certain that he
was following the right path. Still, from the slight knowledge he
possessed of Australian geography, he was assured he must
ultimately reach the road leading to the southern settlements by
keeping the now declining sun upon his right hand. While these
thoughts yet occupied his mind, he saw at some trifling distance
before him a man who had seemingly joined the path he was upon from
another, which came from towards the east. Rashleigh quickened his
steps and called to the stranger, who stopped until he came up,
when, after the customary salutations, the former enquired if he
were going in the right direction for Liverpool. The other, who was
a slim youthful-looking person, replied in a very sweet voice that
he believed so, but was himself almost a stranger to that part of
the country. Rashleigh now asked from whence the youth came, to
which the reply was made that he had lately been in Parramatta, but
was now making his way from South Creek to Liverpool.</p>

<p>Rashleigh, on his part, acquainted his new-found companion that
he had belonged to Emu Plains, and they beguiled the way by talking
over the various topics of interest that had lately occurred in the
Colony within the knowledge of either of them until they reached a
high-road, which the youngster pronounced to be the one they
sought, leading from Sydney southward by Liverpool to Campbelltown,
Airds, Appin, etc. After pursuing this for about half an hour, they
overtook a cart drawn by a single bullock, who was plodding
steadily along, though no driver could be seen. When the travellers
came up, however, they perceived an old woman lying down in the
bottom of the cart, fast asleep. She, apparently relying on the
sagacity of the beast, had resigned herself to the arms of
Morpheus, being no doubt stimulated thereto by deep draughts from a
small keg, which even in slumber she still enfolded in a most
ardently loving embrace.</p>

<p>The cart contained various articles of property of those kinds
that generally constitute the bulk of a <i>settler&rsquo;s
swag</i>. There wore pipes, tobacco, the keg above named, a
quantity of tea and sugar, two or three coarse cotton striped
shirts, and a pair or two of duck trousers.</p>

<p>Rashleigh thought it best to awaken the old lady, fearing if she
were robbed it might be discovered they had passed her on the road,
and they be blamed and perhaps punished for it; so, after shouting
a good many times in vain, he seized the occupant of the cart by
the leg. She, arousing herself, stared at both the travellers
alternately for a second or two, and then burst out with,
&ldquo;Wirrah! Wirrah! Shpare my life! Shpare my life!&rdquo; To
which our wayfarers, overpowered by her ridiculous attitude and the
dolorous gravity of her address, only responded by a loud peal of
laughter; and the poor old soul, who, by the by, still clung to the
keg with the tenacious grip of desperation, resumed her lament:
&ldquo;For the love of the blissed Vargen, don&rsquo;t murder me.
Take what you want, and go your way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph now assured her that they had not the slightest intention,
either to injure or rob her, adding that if such had been their
purpose, they needed not have aroused her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrah thin, what <i>du</i> ye want?&rdquo; demanded the
ancient dame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all; only your company to Liverpool,&rdquo;
returned Rashleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the powers thin, my shild, you shall have all that
same,&rdquo; replied the old woman. &ldquo;Git up and ride in the
cart, the pair of yees.&rdquo; And she now addressed the bullock,
saying, &ldquo;Wo, Nobby! Woa!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor beast, unconscious of his mistress&rsquo;s alarm, had
still been creeping on at his own discretion, but now obeyed the
well-known voice, which he also acknowledged by half turning his
head toward the cart and giving it what seemed a deprecatory shake
or two on perceiving the proposed addition to his burden. The
travellers got up and were most cordially welcomed by its mistress,
who supplied them with some empty sacks, upon which her own august
person had been reposing, directing them to sit down and handing
them the keg when they had done so, inviting them to drink after
she had herself sanctified the bunghole by the application thereto
of her own sweet lips.</p>

<p>Rashleigh received this vessel, and putting it hastily to his
mouth, did not inhale the powerful odour which it emitted; nor was
it until &mdash; in his own opinion, at least &mdash; he had
swallowed an ocean of liquid fire that he discovered the contents
to consist of very powerful raw rum from Bengal. When he had made
this discovery, he hastily set down the keg again, gasping for
breath, and testifying his discomfiture by sundry diabolical grins,
which elicited great mirth from the old lady, who demanded if
he&rsquo;d never drunk a &ldquo;drap o&rsquo; rum&rdquo;
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not like that, nor out of such a droll
drinking-cup,&rdquo; was our adventurer&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother!&rdquo; rejoined the old girl. &ldquo;I
s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re of the silver-spoon sort .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
want a chrishthial tumbler to dhrink out of. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here,
young man, will you have a taast?&rdquo; And the youngster, to
Rashleigh&rsquo;s great amazement, put the keg to his head and took
a hearty swig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, now!&rdquo; said its mistress. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
something like! But by the Jakus, it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; most sundown.
Come Nobby, pull foot. You&rsquo;ll he late at home else! Nobby!
Nobby!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old bullock, who at the first mention of his name, had only
cocked up his ears and whisked his tail, manifestly mended his pace
the second time it was spoken, and absolutely quickened it into a
run on the third repetition. Thus rolling and, tumbling one over
another through the roughness of the road &mdash; while ever and
anon some clumsier jump than common would cause uproarious mirth to
the merry old dame, who made them ever the apology for another swig
at the keg &mdash; they jolted into Liverpool, just as it was
becoming dusk in the evening.</p>

<p>Liverpool is a town about twenty-one miles from Sydney, on the
Great Southern Road of the Colony. It was founded by Governor
Macquarie who, in selecting that name for it, seems to have
expected it would become an important mart of manufacturing
industry or of commercial enterprise. With this view he built an
excellent hospital of great extent, a gaol, a barrack and many
other public buildings. But alas, His Excellency could neither
improve the quality of the soil around it nor supply the deficiency
of water; for although a stream called George s river, navigable!
&mdash; for <i>shell boats</i> &mdash; quite up to the <i>town</i>,
runs in from Botany Bay to the interior, passing very near
Liverpool, yet it flows with salt water, and the only method the
inhabitants found, in after times, to obviate this pressing
deficiency, was by building a dam across the river&rsquo;s bed and
thus repressing the influence of the tides.</p>

<p>When the old convict system fell to decay and the government
establishments were withdrawn, Liverpool sank at once to its proper
grade of a village, and that too, one of the very dullest in all
the Australian colonies, since from the causes we have named above,
it is not nor ever will be the centre of any overabundant
agricultural population; while its want of water effectually
precludes its becoming a manufacturing town of any note. &rsquo;Tis
true, if the <i>trifling</i> sum of a few millions were expended in
deepening the channel of George&rsquo;s river, and in removing the
impediments it presents to navigation, such as trees drifted by the
stream, rocks as large as churches, etc., it might <i>then</i>
become a port, though for what trade as yet appears an insoluble
mystery.</p>

<p>In the days, of which we write, however, there were 1,500
convicts employed by Government there, and a new church was also
erecting by contract, which gave the place quite a bustling and
lively appearance as Rashleigh and his companions entered the town,
though it was just getting night; for all the workpeople were now
returning to their homes, and the prisoners to barracks.</p>

<p>The travellers went on, unheeding the jocular observations made
on them by the loiterers, many of whom hailed the old lady in the
cart with various quaint kinds of salutation; but she only replied
to them by laughing, until a person called out to her in a strong
Hibernian tone, &ldquo;Gerrah, Biddy! Who&rsquo;s thim in the cart
wid you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My governmint min, to be shure, you shpalpeen!&rdquo;
returned Biddy, winking at Ralph, and meaning that they were
convicts assigned to her service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asy now wid your jokin&rsquo;. Shure, id ain&rsquo;t in
airnest she is, young man, is id?&rdquo; said the querist,
appealing to Rashleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; asserted the latter, to keep up the joke.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re this lady&rsquo;s government men.&rdquo; And the
young lad also joined in this harmless deceit, which appeared
highly to delight its object; for, swallowing the story, he roared
out, &ldquo;Whoo! Success, Biddy! Shure, yous&rsquo;ll all be
getting on now, like a house a-fire at both ends!&rdquo; And they
rattled on, leaving him in the midst of apparently earnest
congratulations on this stroke of good luck that had fallen to the
lot of his old acquaintance Biddy.</p>

<p>As they jolted on their way, this ancient dame kept stimulating
the old bullock by repeated cries of &ldquo;Nobby! Nobby!!&rdquo;
uttered reproachfully whenever that discreet animal showed any
symptom of relaxing in his run. And as this continually occurred,
so great an expenditure of breath involved a necessity for
stimulating herself also with the contents of the keg, an operation
at which the old lady was amazingly <i>au fait</i>; for she took
such hearty swigs as quite surprised Rashleigh, who frequently
wondered with what kind of uninflammable composition her throat
must be lined, to enable her to gulp down this liquid lava.</p>

<p>The old dame offered both of her companions in the cart a sup as
often as she drank from the keg, and finding Ralph did not avail
himself of this invitation, she at last insisted on his doing so,
saying, &ldquo;Gerrah, ye wake-barred crathur! Take some of the
native .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shure, it&rsquo;ll keep the cowld out of
your stummick this raw night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, when every bone in Rashleigh&rsquo;s body ached by
reason of the sore bumps he received at the rate of two or three in
every second, the ancient crone observed, &ldquo;Praise be to the
Vargen, I see our lights yonder. We&rsquo;ll soon be at home now,
Nobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments afterwards the old ox turned off the road
towards a cluster of huts situated in the centre of a large
clearing. The noise of their approach, through the rumbling of the
cart and the jingling of the harness, quickly alarmed the
<i>canine</i> inhabitants at any rate, so that a right noisy salute
now welcomed Biddy&rsquo;s return; and to judge from the uproar, at
least fifty dogs surrounded their vehicle, barking, yelling,
jumping and snapping around poor old Nobby the bullock, who however
seemed not at all to be disturbed in his equanimity by the vain
clamour.</p>

<p>Presently a group of bare-legged urchins, bearing torches formed
of filaments stripped from stringy-bark, came racing out, with loud
cries of &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Granny. Welcome home,
Granny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman stopped Nobby with some difficulty, for that
sapient beast began to smell his usual place of repose, and two or
three of the least that were roaring for a ride were placed in the
cart, and once more they were set in motion. The distance was but
very short, and the ancient bullock stopped at the door of a large
rambling hut of the usual kind, in which were six or seven
demi-savage-looking mortals, both men and women apparently, moving
busily about by the light of the fire. The old woman now got out
first and the &ldquo;childher, God bless &rsquo;em,&rdquo; after
her. The precious keg was next received into her loving arms,
having been handed to her by Rashleigh; and the old dame, when she
had thus secured all she apparently thought of any value among the
miscellaneous contents of the cart, left the remainder of her
purchases to be brought in by the young fry, and entered the hut,
bearing with her the burden of that dear native, as she called it,
which seemed to be the object of her most ardent affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome home, Mother!&rdquo; said, or shouted, all the
group. &ldquo;How are you after your journey? And how did the corn
sell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why thin, acushla,&rdquo; replied the old lady,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m most bate down wid fatague and wore out wid sore
thravelling; but id&rsquo;s all no odds now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shure,
I&rsquo;m safe at home wanst more! I sowld die corn raking, and
I&rsquo;ve brought you lashins of tobacky, tay and shuger, and a
dhrop of the crathur! Bud, by the Jakus, I&rsquo;m
aforgettin&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here&rsquo;s two poor
thravellers, childher, I fell in wid by the road; and they&rsquo;ll
sthop wid us to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Cead mille falteagh</i>! Welcome, kindly
welcome!&rdquo; said all the inmates in a breath. &ldquo;Dra&rsquo;
forret to the fire. Supper&rsquo;s been ready this hour, Granny,
and awaitin&rsquo; for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wen thin, alanna, and now I&rsquo;m reddy for id
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But where&rsquo;s my owld man?&rdquo; enquired
Biddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faix thin,&rdquo; returned one of the juniors, &ldquo;he
got tired and wint to bed an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he thin, poor owld sowl!&rdquo; observed the
considerate dame. &ldquo;Bud shure, I&rsquo;ll take him a dhrop of
the shtuff. 1 know he won&rsquo;t mind being awakened for
<i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the mean time some tin pots had been wiped out and a
&ldquo;small taast&rdquo;, as the ancient granny called it,
consisting of about a gill of the fiery spirit, was poured into
each. But when all the vessels in the house had been mustered, they
were not found enough to afford one to each person; so that they
were fain to do as well as they could with one pot to two of their
own family. The strangers, however, were scrupulously attended to,
and received a cup apiece.</p>

<p>When all were thus accommodated, the &ldquo;ould woman&rdquo;
cried out. &ldquo;Now bys and gals, as ye are! I&rsquo;m going to
give you a <i>sintimint</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And bad loock to the
wan that don&rsquo;t dhrink id wid all the veins of their hart!!
Here&rsquo;s success to ould Ireland, for ever and ever,
Amin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh dared not refuse due honour to a toast like that, so
he drank off his liquor &mdash; an example which was followed by
all the others, repeating at the very top of their voices,
&ldquo;Success to ould Ireland! Whoo!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the mean time &ldquo;Granny&rdquo; had gone to an inner
apartment, and presently returned divested of her travelling dress,
which, it should have been stated, was simply an old
horseman&rsquo;s coat. Bonnet she had none, but an ample night-cap
and two or three dirty handkerchiefs did duty in place of it, to
keep out cold.</p>

<p>The whole party now sat down to supper, which consisted of pork
fried, damper bread, and tea, with abundance of eggs and a very
small piece of butter. The meat, as usual, was all put into a dish,
which stood in the centre of the table. Plates, knives, forks, or
tablecloth were apparently superfluous encumbrances which were
utterly unknown to these good folks, each of whom, however, was
provided with a pocket-knife, with which he, or she, first cut a
slice of the cake, then, selecting a morsel of pork to their fancy,
placed the meat on the bread, and sawed away as hard as they liked.
The whole family pressed our travellers to help themselves and not
to be any ways &ldquo;sthrange&rdquo;, but make themselves at home,
the old lady taking the lead in these hospitable solicitations. In
fact, she would fain have persuaded the strangers to devour enough
at least for six meals, telling them that &ldquo;people on the road
ought always to lay in a good foundashun, <i>whin they cud</i>,
seein&rsquo; that none cud tell how soon they might be short taken,
and ded bate for a male of vittles in the wild bush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The supper did not pass over without a feeling lament from the
ancient dame that &ldquo;there wor no <i>shpuds</i> (potatoes) to
be got in this thieving cullony, bekase they wouldn&rsquo;t grow in
id&rdquo;: an idea, which, strange as it may <i>now</i> seem, was
very prevalent about thirty years since in Australia; for whether
it was owing to the want of proper culture or suitable seed or some
other cause, it was exceedingly rare to see these well-known roots
in any part of New South Wales; or, when they were found after many
trials to grow, they scarcely attained the size of hen eggs, even
the largest of them, while by far the greater portion were only
about as large as musket bullets.</p>

<p>Supper being at length over, the &ldquo;equipage&rdquo; was soon
removed and the fragments were equitably shared among two or three
pet pigs, which enjoyed the privilege of the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
into this Australian dining-room, where, indeed, if certain
indubitable symptoms on the floor might be credited, they felt
themselves, if anything, rather more at home than the inmates; for
the human inhabitants of this <i>choice domicile</i>, though they
were sufficiently indifferent to filth, yet did not go the length
of defiling the room to quite so great an extent as the four-footed
denizens.</p>

<p>The philanthropic tenderness of this primitive family was not
confined to the progeny of the sty only, but was extended to a sick
calf that was nursed in one corner and a favourite mare whose
accouchement had taken place in another. The latter, indeed, seemed
to fancy her temporary quarters so well that although she had now
occupied them more than three months, she still made her way to the
accustomed place at nightfall, where she behaved herself with due
and befitting gravity, as might be expected from an animal of
advanced age. Her foal, on the other hand, appeared a perfect imp
of playful mischief, for during the meal, he could scarcely he
restrained from mounting on the supper table altogether; and he
played various tricks by stealing bread from the juniors, then
turning round to kick at them, thus adding with all the levity of
youth &mdash; in every case &mdash; insult to injury, but which
only elicited shouts of laughter and applause from the admiring
witnesses of his frolics, the younger fry of whom enjoyed his
tricks in an uproarious manner, as he formed a most befitting
playmate and jovial companion for them. Beside the quadrupeds, who
shared the floor, a host of fowls roosted among the timbers of the
open roof, whose loud cackling at times testified their unqualified
alarm when the mirth of the family became too obstreperous.</p>

<p>As soon as the table was cleared, a bucket was placed upon it,
to serve as a stand for the rum-keg, which was presently hoisted
into its place surrounded by all the tin pots they could find. A
supply of the tobacco brought by the old lady from Sydney was next
distributed to those who required it, and a few neighbours dropping
in, they seemed bent on enjoying themselves, for two or three
shapeless fragments of drinking-vessels having been filled up with
grease and provided with twisted rags inserted in each to act
instead of lamps in illuminating a space which had been cleared
from obstacles, half a dozen of the youngsters, both male and
female, stood up to dance, an amusement which one or other kept up
with great zest for many hours, although their only music was a
large and ardent tin dish, beaten after the manner of a tambourine,
by a person who really seemed to consider it a labour of love, at
least if one might judge by the awful intensity of the thumps he
bestowed upon his <i>instrument</i> from time to time.</p>

<p>The seniors, in the mean time, sat on either hand, enveloped in
the vapour raised by their <i>dhudeens</i>, which soared in mist
above their heads until it joined the main body of smoke arising
from the fireplace, which, according to established Australian
usage, eschewed the meanness of sneaking off by the regular vent,
but rather seemed to prefer struggling to get out through the
interstices of the roof.</p>

<p>The grave sages who sat around on such seats as chance provided,
among which buckets and tubs turned upside down appeared to be the
favourites, from time to time emitted their admiration of the
performers on the &ldquo;light fantastic toe&rdquo; by loud shouts,
such as, &ldquo;Hurra, Paddy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Now go it, Mick!&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the gal. Biddy!&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
darlin&rsquo;, Norry!&rdquo; and turned from time to time to each
other, criticising upon the excellencies or defects which the style
of either exhibited. The ardent founder of the feast, in the mean
time, was not at all idle, either in partaking of the consolation
derivable from the contents of the keg or in dispensing it to the
guests. So, about midnight, there was as pretty a chaos of dancing,
drinking, roaring, shouting, singing, love-making, kissing and
fighting as Rashleigh had ever borne witness to in all his
days.</p>

<p>He kept as sober as he could without affording serious offence
to the hospitable intentions of his hostess, who many a time and
oft replenished his tin when he would fain have been excused. He
also contrived to remain neutral in a corner, pleading his fatigue
as a reason for not dancing, and was by this means considered fair
game by an old fellow, who had been transported to New South Wales
for participating in the Irish rebellion of &lsquo;98. This senior
posted himself at Rashleigh&rsquo;s side and began a long detail,
in most prosaic style and execrable English, of his wonderful feats
at Vinegar Hill and Enniscorthy, at last <i>favouring</i> him with
a song of interminable length in the Irish language relating to the
same, a musical <i>treat</i> which our adventurer most willingly
would have dispensed with, as he knew as much of Sanscrit as of the
language in question.</p>

<p>But the prosy old chap persisted in his monotonous chant, until
a loud and apparently excited voice having roared out, &ldquo;Whoo,
Shanavest!&rdquo; at the end of the hut, the ancient songster
ceased his ditty, jumped up, and ran to the spot, which now
appeared the scene of a regular scrimmage, or &ldquo;hurra&rdquo;
fight.</p>

<p>The only sounds at all distinguishable by Rashleigh&rsquo;s ears
were &ldquo;Whoo, Shanavest!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Whoo, Carawot!&rdquo;
which ever and anon pealed high above the din of conflict, being
apparently used as battle-cries of contending parties, whose strife
now raged fierce and fell. Old and young, males and females were
mingled in the M&Ecirc;L&Eacute;E, wielding sticks, buckets, broken
stools, or whatever else came to hand, kicking, cuffing, cursing,
swearing, raging and tearing, the men fighting hand to hand with
cruel oaths, the women engaged in more distant combat, swelling the
din with their shrill screams. The children roared, the dogs
growled and bayed fiercely, finally tearing one another with tooth
and claw in ambitious emulation of their masters, the pigs squeaked
and the fowls lent their shrill cackling to augment the uproar,
which seemed of duration as interminable as the confusion was
appalling. In all the row, however, the two strangers were strictly
regarded as neutrals, nor did any of the combatants approach them,
their only danger being from the many missiles that flew about in
all directions.</p>

<p>At length, the belligerents were carried outside by &ldquo;the
fierce current of the heady fight&rdquo;, and the interior of the
dwelling was left in the deep repose of silence for a short time;
after which, the inmates began to straggle back, one by one, to
vent their maudlin grief at the scene of utter dilapidation
presented by their household appurtenances, but pouring out the
fulness of their sorrow in pathetic jeremiads over the prostrate
rum-keg, which had been overthrown early in the conflict, so that a
great portion of its precious contents had escaped on the floor,
where part of it lay in puddles, mingled with the other
abominations of this unsavoury apartment.</p>

<p>But old Granny herself, who lay prone in a corner, soon
attracted the attention of her dutiful offspring, one of whom
staggered towards her; and after twice or thrice falling down
himself in vain attempts to lift up his fallen parent, he at length
gave up this mode of succour as being unattainable under present
circumstances, and after his last tumble, having gained a sitting
position, he edged closer to his mother and taking her head in his
lap, found to his horror that it was covered with blood. He
instantly broke out into a sort of prolonged howl, that might have
almost awakened the dead, saying at last, &ldquo;Ochone! Ochone!
Mother darlint, can&rsquo;t you tell your own Tady who&rsquo;s
afther killing you, and by the Jakus, I&rsquo;ll make him smell
hell, so I will! Och, wirrah, wirrah! What&rsquo;ll we
doe&rdquo;</p>

<p>By and by the pulling and dragging the old dame got from her
sympathising and sorrowful sons and daughters actually restored her
to life; for it appeared she was not dead through the flight of her
immortal spirit, but through the quantity, amounting to a
superabundance, of spirits which she had poured down her throat. In
other and plainer terms, she was dead drunk! But now, slowly
opening her eyes, she gazed around in most ludicrous amazement, and
heaving a deep sigh, exclaimed, &ldquo;Wirrah! Wirrah! Where am I?
Sure it&rsquo;s losht, and disthroyed, kilt, and murdered I am, in
the ind ov my days!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the rest, as with one accord, roared out to know &ldquo;who
bate her&rdquo;. And the old lady was about to reply when her eyes
rested on the rum-keg.</p>

<p>Springing on her feet, she leaped towards this cherished darling
of her heart&rsquo;s warmest affection with an agility that quickly
set the minds of the bystanders at ease as to her having received
any very serious injury. But on finding out the diminished state of
the contents of that valued receptacle, the old lady burst into a
fresh storm of passionate exclamations, until at last her mouth
having approached the bunghole, the fading echoes of her voice were
lost in the reverberating cavity of the keg. Everyone present now
followed the old dame&rsquo;s example, and this genial refresher
having apparently cured all their complaints, they retired to rest,
the travellers being accommodated with a shake-down of straw on a
sheet of bark before the fire.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16" id=

<p class="note">There woman reigns: The mother, daughter, wife<br>
Strews with fresh flowers the narrow way of life.<br>
Around her knees domestic duties wait,<br>
And fireside pleasures gambol at her feet.</p>

<p>The next morning Rashleigh and his companion were first
stirring. The latter, somewhat to Ralph&rsquo;s surprise, made a
fire, swept up the earthen floor, and put the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of the last night&rsquo;s battle into as tidy a state as he could,
for which both received the warmest thanks of their hosts when they
arose. A breakfast, ample in quantity though rude in quality, being
soon after paraded and discussed, the wayfarers departed, having
been first obliged to take a &ldquo;taast of the native&rdquo; just
as old Biddy said, &ldquo;to wash away the cobwebs out of their
heads, afther lasht night&rdquo;., and to this was added a hearty
invitation, if ever either of them &ldquo;passed the door&rdquo;, a
threatened curse if he did so without calling in being implied, of
course.</p>

<p>The route of the travellers now lay along the high-road between
Liverpool and Campbelltown, at which latter place Rashleigh&rsquo;s
companion intimated his journey would end. There were at that time
no ponds and but few houses near the highway in this part, and they
suffered a good deal from thirst as the clay was very warm. They
had, however, no remedy save that of using greater speed, and they
accordingly reached the few scattered huts then dignified by the
name of Campbelltown soon after midday. They went into the first
public-house to solace their thirst, and Ralph observed that the
young man, before he would enter, went to a window that commanded a
view of the single public apartment as if he were anxious to
ascertain who was inside; after taking this survey they went in and
quenched their drought with copious draughts of cider.</p>

<p>Rashleigh proposed to remain awhile to rest and invited his
companion to dine at his expense; but the latter refused, urgently
requesting instead that our adventurer would accompany him to his
sister&rsquo;s, whither he was himself bound, and which was at no
great distance, adding that he was sure Ralph would be most welcome
for his sake. This being at last agreed to, our exile purchased a
bottle of rum, unknown to the other, which he designed to carry
with him as he had observed enough of colonial society to he
certain that this stimulus was always an acceptable adjunct to a
settler&rsquo;s meal, and that the bringer of any was sure of being
doubly welcome.</p>

<p>Having put the liquor up in his bundle, he followed his
companion, who was conversing outside with some female, from whom
he parted when joined by Rashleigh. They both proceeded on their
way, which led them off the high-road, past the church along a
narrow lane bordered by fields of green maize, through which they
walked for nearly a mile, until at the edge of a piece of standing
timber, they saw a pretty little hut with more of an English
appearance about it than any other Rashleigh had yet seen in
Australia. Although it was formed of the ordinary bush materials,
the frame being of split timber and its roof barked, yet the walls
had been coated externally with mud, after the manner of rough
casting &mdash; colonially called &ldquo;daubing&rdquo;&mdash; and
this when dry had been well whitewashed. There was also a verandah
ranging along the whole front, around the rough untrimmed wooden
pillars of which a few parasitical plants had been trained; and
before the dwelling &mdash; what was a most uncommon rarity in
those days to see-there was actually a plot of flowers.</p>

<p>Small, indeed, was the extent of that little parterre, and very
very common were its plants; yet, from its extreme rarity, it
breathed the balmy breath of old England&rsquo;s cherished homes
around the travellers as sweetly as if it had contained many acres
and had been appended to a palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my sister&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Rashleigh&rsquo;s
companion, and Ralph fancied there was some exultation in the tone;
at any rate, he thought a little pride in so neat a relative would
not he unbecoming. The front door was shut, and the travellers went
round to the rear of the house, where they saw a spacious yard,
well enclosed by a high fence made of cornstalks set upright and
kept in their places by rails of split timber on each side of them.
Through the gate of the enclosure might be seen a number of fowls
and a few pigs; and there was a stockyard visible, with milking
sheds and pens for calves, from which a woman was now approaching,
who quickened her steps at the sight of strangers.</p>

<p>Rashleigh&rsquo;s companion spoke not, though it was plain he
was subjected to a very earnest scrutiny by her who now came
towards them, and who at last, to Ralph&rsquo;s extreme surprise,
cried out, &ldquo;What, Jane! My dear <i>girl</i>! Is that
you?&rdquo; And the two sisters, for such they were, were presently
enfolded in a warm embrace. After a few hasty enquiries they
entered the house, our adventurer being invited to accompany them.
The females soon withdrew into an inner apartment, and their
visitor had time to comment upon the very different appearance of
this hut from that of most belonging to the lower classes in the
Colony.</p>

<p>The floor, &rsquo;tis true, was only made of cow dung and ashes
trod into a solid and firm mass, but then, it was level and
clean-swept. The stools and tables, though all of the coarsest
make, being apparently the handiwork of the settler himself, were
scoured until they were perfectly white. The tin pots and dishes
all shone with the resplendence of new-minted silver, and the whole
of the interior was whitewashed to almost a degree of fastidious
purity. The walls, in place of pictures or any other production of
art, were decorated and relieved by suspended bunches of
fresh-gathered and sweetly-scented flowering shrubs, the most
choice indigenous produce of the neighbouring bush.</p>

<p>Rashleigh was musing upon the wide difference between this hut
and the one in which he had spent the previous night, though it had
been occupied by persons of the same rank in life and having the
same means of improvement with his present hosts, when the door of
the bedroom opened and the mistress of the house made her
reappearance. After a few commonplace remarks she busied herself to
set out the dinner. She was a woman apparently of twenty-five, who,
though no great beauty, had a very pleasing countenance. Her dress
was of the simplest form, the only parts in view being a kind of
dimity jacket tied dose up to the throat in front, and extending a
short distance below the hips, with short sleeves, which left bare
the arm from the elbow, and a blue dungaree petticoat with a
checked apron. A pair of slippers, apparently made by the wearer,
completed her costume, for she wore no cap, her hair being neatly,
although very plainly, arranged.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Ralph&rsquo;s late travelling companion made
her appearance, dressed in a very neat and becoming style as a
female; and now our adventurer began to wonder how it was he had
not made the discovery of her sex during the many miles they had
journeyed together. This idea perhaps his countenance betrayed, for
his former companion, after shaking his hand, laughed and said,
&ldquo;I suppose you had no idea your fellow-traveller was a woman,
had you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The comical look which accompanied Rashleigh&rsquo;s
acknowledgement how well she had sustained the part of a man so as
completely to deceive him, caused great mirth to both the sisters,
and they enjoyed it very heartily, after which the matron went to
the back of the house, and ascending on a stump, gave a very loud
and shrill <i>cooee</i> for her husband to cease labour and come to
dinner.</p>

<p>Presently the &ldquo;good man&rdquo; entered, accompanied by a
little troop of children, who, after washing themselves and
welcoming their relative and the stranger, sat down to their meal,
which, though consisting of only salt pork, pumpkins and bread,
with tea as usual to drink, was far better prepared than is
general, the meat having been soaked to deprive it of a portion of
the salt; and the pumpkins, besides having been pared before they
were boiled, were steamed after they were done, which made them dry
and mealy instead of being, to use a colonial phrase, &ldquo;all of
a squash&rdquo; when they were served up, which is generally the
case. The bread was leavened and baked in a huge loaf under an
inverted iron pot, which nude it much lighter and more palatable as
well as more enticing in appearance than the ordinary damper simply
cooked in the ashes of a wood fire.</p>

<p>The appearance of both father and children told that the hand
which thus laboured for their creature comforts also extended its
attention to their personal wants. Rashleigh noticed as they came
in that the children washed themselves in water set ready near the
back door, even to their feet; and those who were too little to do
this properly for themselves were cleaned up by the elder ones.
Their clothing was certainly simple enough, each and all wearing
only a kind of pinafore or smock frock reaching from the neck to
the ankle and made of very coarse osnaburg, but kept as clean and
whole as the nature of their employment allowed. Besides this
single garment, each youngster was equipped with a coarse straw
hat, but of shoes they had none among them, for probably, like
nearly all Australian children, they looked on them as useless
encumbrances.</p>

<p>The father&rsquo;s striped shirt, sleeved waistcoat and duck
trousers were all clean and carefully mended; nay, his very boots,
though patched in all directions, had evidently been well greased
only the night before. in short, cleanliness and care appeared to
be the chief attributes of all belonging to this house, which
formed a complete contrast to the dwellings of Australian farmers
in general.</p>

<p>The husband, who was addressed by the very unpretending
appellation of Bob, welcomed his sister-in-law with great
cordiality, but during dinner he enquired whether there had not
come two <i>men</i> down the lane. On being told that Jane was
<i>one</i> of them, he laughed and asked how far she had come in
that dress. She replied all the way from Parramatta, and the reason
she had adopted it was because she thought it a good deal safer to
travel as a man than a woman, especially on foot and alone. Bob
observed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how anybody could he deceived
in <i>your</i> baby face. I am sure <i>I</i> should find you out in
any dress for a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dinner soon being ended, Rashleigh apologized for taking such a
liberty and produced his bottle of rum. The host at first declined
taking any, but at length, his sister-in-law joining our adventurer
in pressing him, he agreed, upon condition that his eldest boy
should be sent into Campbelltown for some more liquor, so that they
should not be altogether drinking at the stranger&rsquo;s expense.
This being complied with, and the rest of the youngsters dispatched
to their several occupations, the four seniors sat down to drink
their grog and play at cards for a couple of hours, when the
females pleaded fatigue and retired to lie down, while our hero and
his new-found friend stuck to the sport a while longer, until, upon
Rashleigh&rsquo;s stating that he would like to look at the farm,
they set out together for a stroll.</p>

<p>The portion of land cultivated by Bob did not exceed fifty
acres, but it was all good soil, well cleared and carefully tilled.
The fences were nearly new, and maintained in good order; in short,
all the arrangements bespoke as much care out of doors as the
aspect of their domestic management proved to reign within the
walls of their humble home.</p>

<p>Bob told his companion in the course of their walk that he had
been free about two years, having spent all the period of his
sentence in the service of a rich settler near Campbelltown, to
whom he had acted as working overseer for about four years. When he
had married he had held a ticket of leave, but preferred remaining
with his old master until he became free altogether, because he
well knew that a ticket was at best but a very fragile indulgence,
liable to be lost at the will of any great man who might wish to
injure the holder.</p>

<p>When he received his certificate, finding that the savings of
himself and his wife would amount to a pretty fair beginning, he
had looked about him awhile, and having discovered that the land he
now occupied was unused and remained in a state of nature, he made
enquiries respecting the owner, whom he at last discovered to be a
military officer abroad with his regiment, and that a merchant in
Sydney acted as his agent.</p>

<p>To this gentleman, therefore, Bob went, and after a little
bargaining, obtained from him a lease of the whole farm for seven
years, on condition of his clearing fifty acres out of the 1,280 of
which the grant consisted, and giving it up in a well-fenced and
cultivable state at the end of the lease if required to do so. Only
a little while before Rashleigh&rsquo;s visit, Bob had been to
Sydney, where he chanced to see the merchant in question, who told
him Colonel Cornewell &mdash; the owner &mdash; had written lately
to him, stating that if the tenant liked to clear and fence another
fifty acres, he might occupy the whole of the grant for fourteen
years instead of seven. To this proposal the farmer had agreed. A
fresh lease on these terms had therefore been executed, so that the
land was now his for twelve years more, certain; and they hoped, if
they had success during that term, to be able to purchase a piece
of land of their own at the expiration of their occupancy.</p>

<p>Of course, both Bob and his wife had worked very hard, both day
and night occasionally, in falling, stumping and burning off the
land, and Rashleigh found that this truly industrious woman had
always shared her husband&rsquo;s toils, from the first. She helped
him cross-cut the trees, roll them together, mend the fires, put up
the fences; indeed, she was, as Bob observed, better to him than
any government man or even free hired servant would probably be,
for she worked with greater zeal, knowing that herself and her
children reaped all the benefit of her labour. Even at that time
she still wrought as occasion required the same as a man; for her
husband&rsquo;s old master always lending him oxen to yoke their
plough, Mary drove the bullocks while Bob held the stilts, so that
the tedious operation of breaking up the land with a hoe was
avoided.</p>

<p>While they thus talked they came to a piece of rich low land
which was under tobacco; and here were the young ones, busily
engaged with diminutive hoes, chipping between the rows to kill the
weeds. Their father praised their industry, and Ralph taking one of
their tools, Bob took another and worked awhile, to give the
children a <i>spell</i>.</p>

<p>They were thus engaged when one of the youngsters cried out,
&ldquo;Look, daddy! There&rsquo;s a gentleman at the
fence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On turning to observe him, they perceived a person making
towards them dressed in a clean grey shooting-coat, white trousers,
black hat &mdash; in fact, a very decent-looking man. Coming up, he
saluted both the men and enquired if one Robert Marshall lived
thereabout, to which Bob replied, &ldquo;I am the
person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Then Mr Hammell of
Campbelltown told me you&rsquo;d got some fat pigs to sell, and I
am buying pigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered Bob; &ldquo;I <i>did</i> think of
selling some pigs, but I think I&rsquo;ll require the meat myself
now. How many do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to buy a score or two, if I can,&rdquo; said the
stranger, at the same time rather ostentatiously rattling some
dollars in his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>Ralph continued to eye this new arrival, for he thought he knew
the slim form and pale, youthful, rather pretty-looking face again.
He was just going to burst out laughing, but a glance checked him
as his eye met that of the stranger; and all three turned to go
towards the house, conversing as they went about the weather, the
state of the crops, and the prospects of the settlers generally.
When they had got up to the dwelling, Marshall called out his wife,
who quickly made her appearance, and they both walked a short
distance apart to converse together.</p>

<p>In the mean time Rashleigh said, &ldquo;Aha, Mistress Jane, I
knew it was you,&rdquo; though in truth, he was not very sure of
it.</p>

<p>But the stranger smiled archly and replied, &ldquo;Hush!
We&rsquo;re going to have a bit of fun with Bob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others now returned; but Ralph observed that Mary shunned to
meet her sister&rsquo;s eye and also kept a corner of her apron
crammed in her month as if to stifle her inclination to laugh.
Marshall and his customer went to the pigsty together, where the
animals he was willing to sell were pointed out, most eloquently
descanted upon by him, and knowingly examined by the pretended pig
dealer, who, after a good deal of chaffering, finally struck a
bargain, and the contracting parties adjourned to the house to pay
for them and take a receipt.</p>

<p>Writing materials being procured, the stranger sat down, and
made a great parade of looking out the cash. Rashleigh, having been
requested to draw up the necessary document, enquired the
purchaser&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name?&rdquo; returned the <i>soi-disant</i> pig
merchant, with an arch look at Marshall, &ldquo;why, my name is
Jane Bates.&rdquo; At which Marshall jumped up and making a playful
blow at his sister-in-law&rsquo;s head, knocked her hat off, and
then her luxuriant hair, bursting its fastenings, tumbled all over
her face, amid the laughter of Jane and Rashleigh, and to the
discomfiture of Bob, who was forced at length to own, not only that
he did not detect his sister&rsquo;s disguise, but what was more
strange, that he did not know his own best clothes and hat which
she had got on. But, as he observed, the latter after all was not
so much of a wonder, because he had only worn them about twice, for
he very seldom dressed himself up, having something else to do.</p>

<p>By this time the lowing of cattle announced that the cows had
come home, and the men went out to put up the calves in their pen
for the night. The stockyard, though small, was strong and compact,
formed of four horizontal rails and a cap, making in all a fence
about seven feet high. The bails for milking and the calf pen were
both roofed with bark and floored with slabs. The herd comprised
only eight milkers; but, as Marshall remarked, eight good ones were
worth fifty wild brutes that no one could get near, and every one
of these had cost him &pound;20 apiece. They had got some fine
heifers and steers running with them; four of the latter Marshall
intended breaking in the next year, so he hoped soon to have a team
of his own.</p>

<p>At sunset the children all came in to supper, and Jane, having
by that time changed her dress, once more assisted their mother in
washing them and getting ready for their evening meal, which
seemed, by the extent of the preparations, to be considered the
chief one of the day. Indeed, Bob observed that was the case, as a
farmer could then take his time and enjoy himself after his
day&rsquo;s work. Accordingly, the viands included short cakes,
light bread, good fresh butter, cream with the tea, a couple of
young fowls broiled, and plenty of eggs, to which ample justice was
done by all.</p>

<p>After supper, the young fry being dismissed to play for an hour
in the stockyard, the seniors drew their chairs around the fire,
each with a little hot grog, to converse together, Marshall having
asked Jane how she had been getting on lately. Rashleigh discovered
she had only just become free out of the Female Factory at
Parramatta &mdash; the place where all the female convicts not in
assigned service are kept at labour. It appeared that Jane had been
a kind of overseer, or monitress there, until she had lately become
free. And by her accounts, the inmates of that choice establishment
for reclaiming the dissolute members of the tender sex were little
less than incarnate furies, as the following relation, made by the
young woman in question, will show.</p>

<p>Only a short time prior to this period a kind of food called
hominy had been issued to the convicts of both sexes in the Colony
as part of their rations, which was new to them, it being a sort of
porridge made from boiled Indian corn meal. This issue, being a
substitution for other and more palatable food, had caused serious
discontent among all the prisoners, the carriage of the Governor
upon the Race Course at Sydney having, as a mark of their
displeasure, been placarded by stealth with a paper bearing the
marvellously ill-written and worse-spelt inscription of</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thiss year his <i>ommani toms</i> drag &mdash; lord send
itt ma drag im to ell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At which the Australasian representative of royalty was so
grievously irate that he offered a reward of &pound;50 to discover
the daring scoundrel who wished to send him such a long journey to
a place having so hot a climate; but though the author of this
insult was never discovered, yet the exertions made by the
authorities upon the occasion, and the distribution of a few
thousand lashes among the grumblers effectually prevented any worse
consequences from the male convicts.</p>

<p>The gentle dames at the Female Factory, however, openly rebelled
the first morning the hominy was offered to them, and most
positively as well as disdainfully refused to receive it. On this
emergency one of the most active members of the magistracy that
formed the governing committee of the institution was sent for, and
the revd gentleman, who was very short and very fat, came bustling
in, much out of breath with his haste. The cause of the uproar
having been stated to him, he declared that he was perfectly
surprised at their conduct &mdash; this would appear rather a
premature declaration, seeing what followed &mdash; and attempted
to reason with the exasperated fair ones, winding up an eloquent
oration in praise of hominy by stating that he frequently ate it
himself and liked it very well. One of the hardiest of the Amazons
now exclaimed with many expletives that if he had been always
obliged to live upon it he&rsquo;d never have possessed such a
<i>paunch</i> as he then could boast of; but, added she, turning to
her companions, &ldquo;As he&rsquo;s so fond of it, in the
devil&rsquo;s name let him have plenty of it.&rdquo; And she suited
the action to the word by snatching a small kit or piggin of the
much-lauded condiment from one of the bystanders, who had brought
it for the magistrate&rsquo;s inspection. That revd gentleman,
overpowered by the heat of the day and the fervour of his
eloquence, had removed his hat and was wiping away the perspiration
from his rubicund face, when the last words of the virago were
spoken, and ere he could avert the infliction by any means, she
inverted the little kit on his head, driving the vessel down with
her fist.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the hominy had got a little cool pending the
dispute, or the consequences might have been serious. Still the
mess &mdash; which much resembled hasty pudding in consistency
&mdash; was hot enough to be very painful. Besides, the little kit
fitted his head so tightly as to defy his hurried efforts to remove
it; but at last His Reverence escaped, nearly suffocated by this
novel poultice, and pursued by inextinguishable merriment from the
mob of women.</p>

<p>In the mean time, a violent onslaught had been made upon the
body of insurgent Amazons by the matron, or female superintendent,
at the head of a sort of bodyguard of monitresses and other
she-official toadies, who wished to rescue His Reverence from the
sacrilegious claws of his enemies; but alas, the daughters of
Belial were too strong for them. These well-meaning personages
&mdash; matron and all &mdash; were overpowered, and every one
compelled, under the direst threats of punishment, to swallow each
the allowance dispensed for six women, which in good truth was
nearly enough to burst them; and then, as a parting salute, the
rebels shaved every particle of hair from the scalps both of the
superior and of her satellites, finally letting them go as bald as
Capuchin friars &mdash; a mode of treatment, by the way, which the
prisoners might have considered in some degree to partake of the
nature of retributive justice, as shaving the heads of
incorrigibles had been recently recommended by the Matron and
adopted by the assembled committee to be put in force as a
punishment for misbehaviour by the confines.</p>

<p>This second revolt of the Harem was not quelled until after the
escape of many of the ringleaders, which was vainly endeavoured to
be prevented by calling in the aid of a company of soldiers. But
these gallant militaires, who belonged to an Irish regiment
recently arrived from the &ldquo;isle of saints&rdquo;, swore
they&rsquo;d &ldquo;rather kiss the darlin&rsquo;s than charge
them&rdquo;. So they grounded their arms and allowed the Amazons to
escape without opposition, after which order was at length restored
among those who chose to remain.</p>

<p>In talk of this kind the evening passed sociably away, and at a
late hour the party separated. Rashleigh was accommodated with a
comfortable bed and the luxury of a clean pair of sheets for the
first time since he had left Sydney. After a luxurious repose, for
the enjoyment of which the night seemed much too short, our hero
arose, and declining to wait for breakfast, took leave of his
hospitable entertainers and departed, amid reciprocal good wishes,
with a cordial invitation from Marshall to come and see them as
soon as he could obtain liberty from his new master.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">Her face wad fyle the Logan-Water;<br>
Oh, sic a wife as Willie had,<br>
I wadna gie a button for her.</p>

<p>It was early morning when Rashleigh took the road once more,
pondering upon the comfort enjoyed by these industrious people,
whose whole mode of life and manners formed so complete a contrast
to that of the lower classes of Australian society that he scarcely
dared to hope the habitation of Mr Arlack, to which he was bound,
would be in any way comparable to it.</p>

<p>According to the directions he had received, he now retraced his
steps towards Campbelltown, and going on to a small public-house at
the southern end of its straggling street, obtained some breakfast,
after which he enquired among a knot of idlers who were playing at
quoits which was the road leading to Mr Arlack&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mr</i> Arlack!&rdquo; replied the man to whom he
addressed himself. &ldquo;I never knowed as <i>he</i> had got a
handle to his name before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, calling to one of his compeers, he shouted, &ldquo;Why,
what do you think! Here&rsquo;s a cove as wants to find out
<i>Mr</i> Arlack&rsquo;s. An&rsquo;t that a pretty go?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; roared out the other. &ldquo;I say,
young fellow, how long have you been in the Colony?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About two years and a half,&rdquo; replied Ralph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Then you&rsquo;re only green yet, as green as a savoy
cabbage; but old Lunnon Bob is the name we gives your <i>Mr</i>
Arlack. What do you want with him, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I am assigned to him,&rdquo; responded
Rashleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye! Assigned to him, are you? Let&rsquo;s look at
your teeth,&rdquo; said the other; and our adventurer, simply
enough, opened his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! By George!&rdquo; swore the querist.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better knock one half of them there grinders
o&rsquo; yourn out again the first iron-bark fence you come to; for
in the first place, you&rsquo;ll have no use at all for them at old
Bob&rsquo;s, and in the next, Polly Arlack will hate you like hell,
for she&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;ve come a&rsquo;purpose to eat her
out of house and home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this sally, the man&rsquo;s brother compotators testified
their satisfaction by redoubled peals of horse-laughter; and
Rashleigh, taking such treatment in dudgeon, was about to depart
when the fellow who had first spoken to him offered him a drink of
something from a pot he held, saying as he did so, &ldquo;Never
mind that old fellow, he&rsquo;s only having a lark with you. Come,
drink a drop o&rsquo; this; you won&rsquo;t have a chance again
soon. Now, do you see them slip-rails? Well, you must rum down a
road that leads through them, and follow it along until you come to
a farm you&rsquo;ll see in a cleared bottom; enquire there and
they&rsquo;ll show you the path to Lunnon Bob&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thanking the man, Rashleigh followed the route he had thus
indicated, and soon arrived at the first farm, where the dogs, to
the number of at least a score, rushed out upon him with tremendous
yells, their gaunt and bony frames testifying such an extremity of
famine as might well inspire fear in the breast of anyone whom they
assailed, lest the ravenous brutes should immolate him as the
readiest means of appeasing that hunger which had reduced them to
skeletons.</p>

<p>This danger he happily escaped, and being again instructed as to
the proper path, at length arrived upon Bob Arlack&rsquo;s farm.
The culture of this <i>cherished</i> spot of the earth&rsquo;s
surface did not afford any very high specimen of the arts of
agriculture. Weeds of rank and luxuriant growth formed by far the
most prominent objects in the so-called cultivated field, amid
which, in one corner, about ten acres of straggling rows of maize
seemed to maintain a most desperate conflict for sufficient air
from the heavens and nutriment from the soil to enable them to
support a sickly existence.</p>

<p>Other crops there seemed to be none, and the rest of the cleared
land was enjoyed by the weeds in undisputed supremacy. Where the
fence could be seen, it appeared in a most dilapidated condition;
the bush poles of which it had at first been composed were in many
places broken down and in others altogether missing, thus leaving
the paddock they were destined to secure at the mercy of any
vagrant animal who might chance to stray that way. At the farther
end of this clearing might be seen a cluster of huts, towards which
a narrow pathway appeared to lead, that Rashleigh now followed; but
upon his getting near his destination, the view did not afford any
very cheering anticipations of his future lot.</p>

<p>The principal dwelling, or home of all the Arlacks, was a hut
which, even in that age of simple materials and rude workmanship,
might claim pre-eminence for ugliness and deformity. The walls,
having dropped much out of the perpendicular, were shoved up by
props applied externally. The gaping orifices in the bark roof
bespoke premature decay, occasioned by neglect. The chinks between
the slabs, of fully an average width, had once been attempted to be
stopped; but the rain having wetted the plaster through the yawning
fissures, it had fallen in piecemeal, and was never renewed; and
finally, it seemed a moot point whether there was more filth to be
found inside, or out, of this most <i>delectable dwelling</i>.</p>

<p>As Ralph drew nigh the door, a shoal of half-starved hens and
ducks disputed the precedence of the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> with him;
while just as he was crossing the threshold, a whole flight of
these <i>fowl</i> intruders, apparently alarmed by some unexpected
opposition from within, fluttered out past his head with most
discordant screams. Inside the hut was a being of <i>epicene</i>
gender; at least, its dress rendered sex doubtful, inasmuch as the
upper parts, which first met his gaze, were, a tattered man&rsquo;s
hat and shirt, both marvellously out of repair, and utterly
unacquainted with any kind of ablution or other purification. The
elf locks which in greasy and matted luxuriance shaded her face,
and a questionable garment that depended from her middle, looking
more like a petticoat, however, than anything else, seemed in
Rashleigh&rsquo;s opinion to stamp this apparition of uncleanliness
as a female, and accordingly he saluted her as such, with,
&ldquo;Pray, ma&rsquo;am, is Mr Arlack at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady replied, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here just now. What do
you want with him? Drat them fowls!&rdquo; she added
parenthetically. &ldquo;What a deuce of a row they kick
up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied our exile,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assigned to him, from Emu Plains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; returned the dame. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the new
government man. Sit down and rest yourself.&rdquo; And then she
began again the execution of some domestic duty which the irruption
of the feathered invaders had apparently interrupted.</p>

<p>Rashleigh, having obeyed her injunctions to be seated, calmly
surveyed his future mistress at his leisure. In person Mrs Arlack
was rather above the middle height, but so far from being <i>en bon
point</i> that her <i>enemies</i> called her skinny. Her cheek
bones in particular were remarkably prominent. Above these twinkled
a sparkling pair of small greenish-grey eyes. These orbs of vision,
in apparent mistrust of the &ldquo;willainy of the world&rdquo;, as
Arlack would express it, had retreated as far as possible from the
surface of her countenance, and taken up their abode at the bottom
of two deep caverns, the entrances to which were fortified by stiff
bristly overhanging brows of portentous size and a very dirty
flaxen hue. Her nose, from its irregular aquiline shape, bore no
slight resemblance to the broken bill of a cockatoo, but ever
appeared to maintain an anxious guard over the orifice that formed
a most capacious mouth, into which, in fact, the nasal protuberance
seemed desirous of intruding its extremity <i>at least</i>.</p>

<p>Her complexion, as far as the important fact could be
ascertained through the dirt which so perpetually begrimed it, was
a kind of dingy yellow, and her voice was a not very melodious
compound of a growl and a squeak.</p>

<p>As Mrs Arlack was so philosophically negligent of the means of
setting off her own most powerful natural charms by any recourse to
the fastidious arts of tidiness or cleanliness, it may easily be
conceived that her dwelling was none of the neatest on earth.
Indeed, the complicated arrangement of unhewn timber, which by the
greatest stretch of courtesy was called a table, appeared never to
have been cleansed or washed since it first was put together and at
present afforded a singular <i>m&eacute;lange</i> of movables,
among which may just be mentioned a large black iron pot, leaning
negligently on one side, so as to show a little hominy in the
bottom; a few wooden spoons, of most indubitable native
manufacture, as they might vie in size as well as rudeness with the
paddles used by the Tonga Islanders; some half-munched fragments of
corn cake; in divers places a plentiful sprinkling of tobacco ashes
from the pipe of the proprietor; a lump of blackish-yellow
home-made soap swimming in a puddle of slop; a lot of ragged
children&rsquo;s clothing, with a few filthy napkins among them;
and some four or five dirty tin pots, which were battered and
bruised into all manner of shapes.</p>

<p>The earthen floor of this <i>recherch&eacute;</i> retreat was
plentifully strewn with fowls&rsquo; dung, <i>agreeably</i>
chequered by petty lagoons of stinking water. The fireplace, for
want of care, had most grievously suffered in its contests with the
fury of the element it was erected to control, for many of the
slabs that composed it were burned quite across at their bottoms,
leaving large orifices for the accommodation of a stray dog or pig
who might wish to enjoy the genial warmth of the ashes, which a
grunter was at that moment doing, having stretched his lazy length
along in perilous proximity to a blazing log.</p>

<p>To crown all, the hut appeared the chosen rendezvous of myriads
of fleas upon the floor and of clouds of flies in the air, the
perpetual biting of the former serving to counteract the somnolent
desires occasioned by the monotonously drowsy hum of the
latter.</p>

<p>While Rashleigh was intently gazing upon the varied rich and
rare beauties of this <i>charming</i> prospect, a pot on the fire
near him boiled over suddenly, and Mrs Arlack cried out, in a tone
like that of a cracked tin trumpet, &ldquo;What the hell are you
gaping at, you, sir? Why don&rsquo;t you take the pot
off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he hastened to do, and the <i>lady</i> added,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better look a little smart here, I can tell you.
We don&rsquo;t like no sleepy-going coves about our
farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes more, Mr Arlack appeared at the door, dressed
in a dirty and ragged cotton shirt, ditto duck continuations, a
dilapidated straw hat, and boots to match.</p>

<p>His <i>beauteous</i> helpmate said, &ldquo;Here, Bob, is a new
government man for you;&rdquo; and showed him the pass which she
had received from Rashleigh.</p>

<p>While his new master was reading, or rather pretending to read
this pass, Rashleigh observed that Mr Arlack was short, squat and
bowlegged. His mouth, to use a colonial witticism, was unlike a
poor man&rsquo;s lease in being &ldquo;from y-ear to y-ear&rdquo;,
because it stretched from <i>here</i> to <i>yonder</i>; and yet, in
spite of its size, it seemed still to be too small for his tongue,
which, whenever its owner was quiescent, protruded very much and
<i>wobbled</i> about in an extraordinary way as often as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Besides the decidedly <i>open</i> feature above referred to,
Arlack possessed a most splendid squint with both eyes, so that it
was often observed he would make a capital cook, as he could always
keep one eye on the pot while he surveyed the intricacies of the
chimney with the other; and, to complete the catalogue of his
complexional recommendations, his face was absolutely furrowed,
seamed and gashed until it had nearly lost a human shape by the
pitiless assaults of the smallpox.</p>

<p>As Mr Arlack had originally been a member of the ardent
fraternity of <i>chummies</i> in the cityward regions of London, he
had there contracted the usual cockney contempt for the letters
&ldquo;v&rdquo; and &ldquo;w&rdquo;, transposing those much injured
visible signs of spoken sounds in the most careless and ludicrous
manner. His first address to our adventurer exemplified this
peculiarity; for having apparently at last deciphered the date of
the pass, he demanded, &ldquo;Vell, and vere have you been to all
this vile? Vy didn&rsquo;t you come &rsquo;ere sooner than this
&rsquo;ere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a very good hand at walking,&rdquo; replied
Rashleigh; &ldquo;but I did not lose much time on the road, any
more than I could help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;I
<i>s&rsquo;pose</i> not; but howsomever, I von&rsquo;t take no
furder notice of this &rsquo;ere breach. Sally, did you give him
his mess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sally. &ldquo;I thought there was time
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, vell. Give it to him now, and let him go to his
hut,&rdquo; returned the <i>caro sposo</i> of the <i>amiable</i>
lady, who thereupon left off mixing up her corn meal and enquired
of Ralph, &ldquo;What are you going to put your mess in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know, unless you may be good enough to lend me a bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; retorted the dame.
&ldquo;Lend <i>you</i> a bag, indeed! A pretty thing, as if
I&rsquo;d got nothing to do but make bags for government
men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As this was spoken with sufficient haughtiness to show that she
was fully aware of the <i>immeasurable distance</i> in point of
station between herself and the applicant, Ralph saw he could not
hope for any accommodation from her, and he replied, &ldquo;Very
well, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;ll put it in my handkerchief and hat, if
you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said his mistress. And after
measuring the grain with the greatest nicety in a quart pot, she
said, &ldquo;There now. There&rsquo;s a peck of corn (maize) for
you, and here&rsquo;s four pounds of pork. That&rsquo;s your
week&rsquo;s mess, and you&rsquo;ll come to me this day week for
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not if I can help it, thought Rashleigh, as he withdrew to the
hut, which Mrs A. pointed out from her back door as his future
residence. He passed a small shed open on three sides, where there
was a steel mill. A little beyond this stood three diminutive
stacks of bush hay and straw, which the efforts of the cattle had
nearly overturned, these roving bands of plunderers having nibbled
all round their bottoms until they looked just like whipping-tops,
supported by some most mysterious agency. A little beyond these
stood the government men&rsquo;s hut.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined from the account given of Mr
Arlack&rsquo;s own dwelling that the abode of his assigned servants
was anything but a palatial residence. In good truth, a more
desolate and neglected-looking hole can scarcely be conceived. Two
rude sleeping-places constructed of sheets of bark, and three
pieces of broken iron pots comprised all the movable articles,
except two short blocks of wood. The sides and roof were more than
commonly pervious. The earthen floor was covered with littered
straw, apparently wasted out of one of the berths, where it lay as
if the occupant used it for a bed, loose as it was. On a fence
opposite the door hung a mass of rags, which only close examination
could convince an observer had once been a blanket. Ralph, who had
found an empty bag hanging up, went his way to grind the maize with
the steel mill. This instrument was in very bad repair, and sunset
arrived by the time he had ground his pittance of meal, which was,
after all, so coarsely done that if he had used a sieve fully half
of the weekly allowance would have been lost; but Mr Arlack&rsquo;s
establishment did not allow such a wasteful piece of
refinement.</p>

<p>He now returned to the wretched hut, brought a little wood in,
made up a fire, and swept the floor with a handful of leafy boughs.
While he was thus engaged, his future companion came in, bearing a
calabash full of water. Rashleigh had well-nigh fainted with
affright at the first glimpse he caught of this gaunt and woebegone
wretch, whose emaciated figure would have well befitted him to
represent Shakspeare&rsquo;s starved apothecary, so much so,
indeed, that our adventurer at first deemed him no earthly being;
but the spectral visitant speedily reassured him by saying, though
in melancholy and sepulchral tones, &ldquo;Well, mate! You&rsquo;ve
come <i>home</i>, I see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; returned Rashleigh; &ldquo;and a pretty
<i>home</i> it is to come to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other only replied by a significant gesture, and after
having brought in his tattered bed-clothes, set himself to work in
the preparation of some hominy. Having procured another of the
pieces of iron pot, Ralph followed his example, and both sat down
upon the blocks to eat this meagre fare. Salt or sugar they had
none, and Rashleigh could swallow only a few mouthfuls of the
tasteless repast; but his companion, after remarking that he did
not seem to like hominy, quickly finished what he had left. He then
produced a few dry leaves of bush tobacco, offering some to our
exile, who declined it, while &ldquo;Jem&rdquo; filled a rough
wooden pipe and sat down to smoke in silence.</p>

<p>After a while, he asked Rashleigh whether he had yet obtained a
blanket, and being answered in the negative, observed that he ought
then to go to the house and ask for one; which Rashleigh did, and
received a tattered rag from Mrs Arlack, after a few muttered
curses from his master for being so troublesome. Ralph ventured to
observe &ldquo;that it did not seem a very good one&rdquo;; but the
<i>gentle</i> dame replied, with an oath, that &ldquo;most likely
the blanket was as good as he was&rdquo;, and then shut the door in
his face; upon which rebuff he returned to his companion, who aided
him in bringing a quantity of straw to lie upon, which was laid in
the vacant berth, and as comfortable a bed made as circumstances
would permit.</p>

<p>Rashleigh slept quickly, nor did he awake until his hut-mate
shook him by the shoulder, saying it was more than time to get up,
for the laughing jackasses &mdash; certain birds so called &mdash;
had been crying out a long while. Ralph tumbled out quickly, and
began to put on his clothes in great haste.</p>

<p>Before he had done this, however, though it was not yet clear
daylight, Arlack was at the door, damning them for a pair of lazy
beggars, and asking if they meant to stop there all day. When they
came out he said to Rashleigh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you vot it
is, my fine svell cove. You an&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to do as you
likes here. So don&rsquo;t think it. If you don&rsquo;t brighten
your lamps (open your eyes) pretty quick, I&rsquo;ll try what good
a <i>teazing</i> (flogging) will do you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And as for
you, Jem, you ort to know better. &lsquo;Ow do you expect I&rsquo;m
agoin&rsquo; to find you in wittles if you lies there stinking till
these &rsquo;ere &lsquo;ours of a morning, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bob,&rdquo; replied Jem in a plaintive tone of
apology, &ldquo;I overslept myself; and this young fellow I suppose
was tired arter his journey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob, indeed!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I think it
might he Mr Arlack, or Master at any rate, in your mouth! Have I
served my lagging in all sorts of misery to be &lsquo;Bobbed&rsquo;
by you, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus grumbling and growling, he led the way to the house, where
he gave to each a tremendous large hoe, saying, &ldquo;There, Jem.
You know the new ground. Go there with your mate and pitch into it,
and I&rsquo;ll be down presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh and his companion went to a distant part of the farm
which had just been cleared, and where a small portion was newly
broken up. Jem now explained the manner in which they were to set
in, each taking a piece to himself, so that the work could be
afterwards measured without difficulty, as Arlack insisted upon his
men doing the full government task at all kinds of labour every day
that a man went into his ground.</p>

<p>Now the allotted portion of new land for each assigned servant
to break up was thirteen superficial rods per day, two spits deep;
and even in a favourable spot it was found quite work enough; but
here the soil was as hard as stone, and the hoe rebounded off it.
Rashleigh was very soon bathed in perspiration; but he kept on,
thinking it might come easier after a bit. About eight
o&rsquo;clock they went home to a breakfast of more hominy, with a
little pork fat to relieve it, and in half an hour resumed their
work. Arlack came to look at them very soon after breakfast, and
seeing that Rashleigh had done only a very small portion of his
task, he abused him most heartily, telling him that it was just as
he expected; but he&rsquo;d take care no beggar had the laugh of
him, to make him find rations for nothing. If he hadn&rsquo;t got
his government work done by sundown he might look out, for he
should go to Court, and then he&rsquo;d find out there was no
gammon in Bob Arlack.</p>

<p>Such were the truculent threats of this worthy that Ralph began
with all his heart to wish himself back again on Emu Plains; but
still, as he knew he could not try any harder than he had done, he
hoped to be forgiven if he were taken before the magistrates, and
therefore resolved not to give Arlack any insolence that might
furnish him with a further and more reasonable ground of complaint.
But by steady perseverance he managed to get his task done a few
minutes after sunset, his master having been standing over him for
fully two hours before.</p>

<p>Tired to death, and every bone aching with the severity of his
toil, our unlucky adventurer hastened home and threw himself on his
miserable bed, where he lay like one entranced until morning, not
even feeling energy enough to get up and prepare any food.</p>

<p>Mr Robert Arlack belonged to a class at that time very numerous
in New South Wales, both among the very great and very little, who
looked solely upon their assigned servants or government men as
machines for getting money, and who with this view worked them most
unmercifully, extracting from each the full quota of work
stipulated by the regulations; and if they broke down, returned
them to Government, obtaining fresh ones in their places. In fact,
they considered convicts to be only a more expensive kind of
labouring cattle, and on account of their not being able to live
upon grass, a trifle less worthy than working bullocks. With such
views they never thought of giving these unfortunate wretches a
single ounce of any nourishment they could possibly avoid or a
single article of raiment unless absolutely compelled; and strange
to say, it was only very recently that regulations were made by Sir
R. Darling, then Governor, to compel an equitable supply of food
and clothing to be given by assignees to their servants; and even
then, for a long period the regulations were evaded. Thus the
position of convicts assigned to private service, even of the more
wealthy among the early settlers, was sufficiently irksome, because
these gentlemen, for the most part avowing that they came so many
thousand miles from home for the sole purpose of amassing fortunes,
considered any and all means to be sanctified by such an end. As
for those whose fortune allotted them to the employment of the
lower class of Australian agriculturists, their lot was pitiable in
the extreme.</p>

<p>The latter, being men who had for the most part served sentences
of transportation during which they had themselves suffered all the
rigour of oppressive task masters, thought they were fully
justified in retaliating upon those whom the change of fortune
incidental to freedom had placed under them all the ill usage which
they had endured in their periods of bondage. Besides this, they
also had the incentive of a grasping desire to get money; though
the majority of them could neither use nor accumulate any sum, but
regularly wasted the produce of their land in scenes of the most
brutal debauchery, which they continued as long as they had the
means, and starved during all the rest of the year, both themselves
and their families and of course their assigned servants subsisting
almost entirely upon maize.</p>

<p>In addition to these evils of starvation and hard work, convicts
assigned to such men as these were obliged to endure all the acts
of petty tyranny and overbearing malice that vulgar minds,
intoxicated by the acquisition for the first time in their lives of
almost unlimited power over a fellow being, alone could either
conceive or prompt the execution of. And no complaints, however
well founded, stood the slightest chance of redress, for the simple
reason that the magistrates before whom such complaints must be
brought were all masters of convicts themselves and consequently
highly interested in upholding what they no doubt considered a
<i>proper</i> system of discipline and subordination.</p>

<p>Then again, the overbearing pride and <i>hauteur</i> generally
assumed towards government men by their masters tended much to
irritate the minds of the former, more especially when it happened
that their superiors for the present were men who, originally
steeped to the lips in the cornmission of every atrocity, had at
length but recently become free themselves, too many of them having
also acquired freedom by acts of the basest treachery, or by the
most tyrannical abuse of power entrusted to them as constables,
overseers, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>.</p>

<p>For many days Ralph Rashleigh wrought at the hoe, breaking up
new ground in the manner before described, until at length, having
recovered his appetite, he found his ration very insufficient; and
as he could not starve, he had recourse to the system he had
learned on Emu Plains, of grating corn to meal. In order to supply
animal food, he laid all sorts of plans to trap the poultry
belonging to the farm; and this went on until Mrs Arlack began to
suspect her government men of being the culprits chargeable with
this crime. She came into the hut one night at the moment after
Rashleigh had taken out of the pot two of her young ducks, scenting
the odour of which, she vented her anger in most opprobrious
epithets; but as Ralph had seen her approaching, he concealed the
spoil in such a manner as to defy her strictest search. Still, she
could see the liquor in the pot, and truly enough insisted it was
some of her poultry that had been boiled therein.</p>

<p>After this narrow escape from detection. our adventurer, still
goaded by hunger, resorted to another means of cooking any fowls he
could purloin. Not daring to bring them into the hut, he made fires
in such secluded spots of the bush as might be secure from
observation. Some hours afterwards, when the fires were
sufficiently burned down, he enveloped the birds in tempered clay,
feathers and entrails included, then covered the whole mass with
red-hot ashes, after the manner of baking a cake. When sufficiently
done, the covering would break off like pieces of potsherds,
carrying with it the feathers incorporated in the clay; and on
opening the bird, all the entrails fell out in a lump, leaving the
cavity perfectly clean and wholesome.</p>

<p>His mistress, who found her stock of poultry diminish fearfully
under this process, having no means of securing or watching the
objects of plunder, at last resolved to watch the suspected
plunderers; and one night, as Rashleigh sat alone by the fire,
revolving plans in his mind of escaping from this state of
intolerable thraldom, to the service of Government, he heard the
sound of breathing close to his ear, and turning suddenly round, he
saw through a chink the light reflected from the fire by a pair of
sparkling eyes, and through other minor causes he rightly
conjectured his mistress was there. He took no notice, however, but
went to bed and pretended to snore audibly soon after. Presently
Mrs Arlack entered the hut on tiptoe, having very stealthily opened
the door. She marched round the place, peeping into every nook and
cranny she deemed could possibly conceal even the bones of a fowl,
but could find nothing.</p>

<p>Rashleigh now feigned to talk in his sleep, and after some
indistinct muttering said distinctly, &ldquo;Two last night
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two more tonight, feathers and all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The old goose too. Feathers and all. Oughch! Feathers and all
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oughch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, turning partially and heavily over, he began to snore more
loudly than ever; but all the time he took great care to observe
the prowling dame with a very small portion of one of his eyes
unclosed. That good lady seemed almost beside herself with rage.
She looked round apparently for something to strike him with, but
finding no weapon at hand, had time to recollect herself, and
withdrew.</p>

<p>Rashleigh now went to sleep in reality; but some time in the
night he awoke, and going to the fire to light his pipe, he
observed through a hole in the slabs part of a plaid cloak, which
he knew belonged to his mistress.</p>

<p>Close by the fire was a pot full of liquor, in which pork had
been boiled, which, through a hollow log that ran near it having
taken fire, was now simmering, and appeared pretty hot. Pretending
to kick against the pot, he muttered a curse, and seizing it by the
pothooks, dashed its contents full at the hole. A loud shriek
attested the success of his cruel experiment, and Rashleigh ran
out. He was saluted by Mrs Arlack &mdash; for she it was, as he had
anticipated &mdash; with a volley of oaths and the most dire abuse,
she swearing she was scalded to death, and that she would have him
hanged, if there was any law or justice to be obtained in New South
Wales.</p>

<p>In the midst of this tumult, Arlack came running out in his
shirt, armed with an axe; and before Rashleigh could defend
himself, the axe was thrown at his head, which it very fortunately,
but narrowly, missed. His master then rushed upon him like a fury,
bellowing all sorts of threats; but as he came with his head rather
low, Rashleigh raised up his knee, which caught Arlack in the mouth
at the same rime that he received a well-aimed blow planted just
under his right ear, that felled him senseless to the earth.
Dreadful was now the clamour of Mrs Arlack, who had got hold of the
axe, which she uplifted to strike our adventurer; but he, closing
upon her, wrested the murderous weapon from her hand and pushed her
backwards on the ground. Then, bidding her get up and take her
husband away with her, he retreated into the hut, fastening the
door as well as he could, and keeping the axe with him.</p>

<p>His discomfited master and mistress withdrew, vowing that
they&rsquo;d get our adventurer hanged, at least, next day; but as
soon as they were out of sight, Rashleigh dressed himself and left
the hut. He walked to the residence of the district constable,
about eight miles off, where he told his tale and begged protection
from the brutality of Arlack and his wife, showing in confirmation
of the truth of his statement, the axe he had brought with him, and
his face, which had been much torn by Mrs Arlack&rsquo;s nails in
the struggle.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that this worthy official wanted the services
of a man for a few days, and he had, besides, a strong though
concealed hatred of Arlack; so he listened very attentively to the
story, and when it was over, received Rashleigh, locking him up in
a small room used for purposes of confinement.</p>

<p>About an hour after sunrise Mr Arlack arrived, and our
adventurer, on hearing his well-known voice, repaired to an
orifice, where, himself unseen, he could still both see his master
and hear the awful account he gave the constable, of a
&ldquo;vicked and murderous assault made by a willain of a
government man of his, both upon himself and his vife&rdquo;,
concluding by saying that &ldquo;the wagabond had bolted avay with
an axe, and as he vas a most desperate willain, the constable had
better look out for him&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the constable, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
nothing like hearing both sides of a story, certainly. I had heard
your man&rsquo;s, for he has been here this three hours, and now
I&rsquo;ve heard yours. But I expect the magistrates will have to
settle betwixt you. So I&rsquo;ll only tell you my private opinion,
and that is, that you are both a liar and a rascal, and your wife a
damned sight worse than you are! I&rsquo;ve had my eye upon the
pair of you this long time, and I&rsquo;ll let the magistrates know
how you goes on with your men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arlack was rather taken aback at this unexpected rebuff; but, at
last recovering a portion of his native impudence, he retorted,
&ldquo;Vell, and I should jist like to know vot it is to you, how
ve uses our government men, eh? I&rsquo;ll tell you vot it is, Mr
Constable, you&rsquo;d better mind vot you&rsquo;re arter, or
I&rsquo;ll try if I can&rsquo;t put a lever under you that&rsquo;ll
hoist you flying out of your billet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be off with you!&rdquo; said the man in office, enraged.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t come here athreatening of me in the
execution of my dooty, or else I&rsquo;ll find a shop for you, as
free as you are.&rdquo; And off went Mr Arlack in high dudgeon at
his reception, which greatly delighted Rashleigh, who had been a
gratified spectator of his mortification.</p>

<p>In a little while, the door of the place of confinement being
unlocked, the constable let Ralph out, saying, &ldquo;As
you&rsquo;ll be here a week now before there&rsquo;s any Court, if
you have a mind to help me on my bit of ground a little, I&rsquo;ll
find you in summat to eat for your trouble; and that&rsquo;ll be
better for you than stopping in here upon dry bread, which is all
that Government allows for prisoners before they are
tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh very gladly assented, and after a hearty breakfast
they went out together to burn off some fallen timber. About noon,
however, another constable came, who spoke to the lock-up keeper in
private; and they both departed together, leaving Ralph to work
alone during the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Shortly after sunset the myrmidons of the law returned, bringing
with them a prisoner. When our adventurer came in from work he
found them in high glee, and by their conversation it was evident
they anticipated a heavy sum of money as a reward. They had also
brought with them some spirits, for the lock-up keeper gave
Rashleigh a small quantity before he locked him up.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18" id=
"Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18</b>
</h2>

<p align="center" class="note">Come, read me my riddle! Come,
hearken my tale!<br>
And tell me the craft of bold Allen-a-Dale.</p>

<p>The imperfect light which streamed through the chinks of the
slabbed partitions between the place of confinement in the lock-up
house and the room occupied by the constables enabled Rashleigh to
see that the other confine was a very tall and bulky man, who lay
upon the rude floor, wrapped up in an opossum-skin cloak. He
scarcely deigned any reply to Ralph&rsquo;s salutation of
good-evening, but aroused himself, after a little while, upon
observing that our adventurer had brought in a lighted pipe with
him, and asked the other to fill one for him, which the stranger
could not do for himself, as he was handcuffed.</p>

<p>This little piece of kindness, being performed, seemed to abate
something of the stranger&rsquo;s sullen reserve, for he sat up,
and in reference to the mirth of his captors, who, it appeared by
their jovial conversation, were now getting merry over their grog,
the new-comer observed, in a tone of grim irony, &ldquo;Aye, booze
away, my boys. You think you&rsquo;re all right now; but my turn
will come again yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This remark exciting Rashleigh&rsquo;s curiosity, he asked what
his companion in captivity was confined for, but received only an
evasive reply; and finding that the other eschewed any
conversation, Ralph made a sort of bed with a few articles lent to
him for that purpose by the lock-up keeper, on which he lay down
and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>Far in the night he was awakened by someone who said, &ldquo;Get
up, and come along,&rdquo; shaking him as he did so. Not being
thoroughly aroused, he could only at the moment notice that the
door of the lock-up was open, and that a tall figure was going
towards it. He involuntarily arose to dress himself; but before he
had got his jacket on, the same figure reappeared, saying,
&ldquo;Why the hell don&rsquo;t you make haste?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh thereupon went forth into the outer apartment, where
he saw half a dozen men, in various dirty dresses, but all armed to
the teeth. The two constables were fast asleep, with their arms
resting on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said a voice which Ralph recognised as being
that of the late captive, &ldquo;get some fire sticks. We&rsquo;ll
set light to the hut and burn both it and these blasted dogs
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; responded his companions, thronging
around the fireplace to obey the cruel mandate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; cried Rashleigh,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t burn the men, but go away. As you&rsquo;ve got
out, they won&rsquo;t know anything about it, and you may be far
enough before they awaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your infernal tongue!&rdquo; retorted the other.
&ldquo;Or else we&rsquo;ll handcuff you and chuck you neck and
heels into the lock-up again, to be roasted like a snake in a
log.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph was about to reply; but the man, whose strength was equal
to his tremendous size, put one hand over his mouth, and gripping
him by the collar with the other, led him out. They walked to a
small distance in front of the hut, when Rashleigh&rsquo;s
companion halted and released him. Turning towards the lock-up,
Ralph could see the roof was already in a light blaze; and as it
was thatched with reeds, that combustible covering was rapidly
consuming with a loud crackling noise, which contrasted fearfully
with the perfect stillness of all around, and which, as our
adventurer hoped, could not fail of awakening the slumbering
inmates.</p>

<p>Apparently his huge captor thought so too, for he asked of those
standing near, &ldquo;Has anyone fastened the <i>jigger</i> and the
<i>jumps</i> (door and windows)?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; responded another. &ldquo;I took
blasted good care not to leave the rascals a hole to creep out
of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; said the horror-stricken Rashleigh.
&ldquo;You surely will not let the poor wretches die such a
dreadfully lingering death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mind your own business, and be damned to you,&rdquo;
was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least, then,&rdquo; persisted Ralph; &ldquo;save the
woman and her children. Think of your own mothers,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now by hell and the devils!&rdquo; roared the former
captive. &ldquo;If you breathe another whisper, I&rsquo;ll blow
your head off!&rdquo; And as he said so, he cocked a horse-pistol,
which he held close to his prisoner&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>The stern determination of this ferocious ruffian&rsquo;s
countenance, rendered plainly visible by the light of the burning
hut, which cast a ruddy glare around, told Rashleigh he was not to
be trifled with, and he wrung his hands in an agony of horror.
Still, though the thatch of the lock-up house was now all consumed,
and the flames had seized upon the slabbed ceiling, the doomed
inmates slept on. Ralph supposed the men were insensible through
intoxication, but knew not how to account for the sound sleeping of
the woman, who, with her two children, had retired to rest at the
same time that he was himself locked up. In a few minuters more, a
portion of the roof that had stood over their sleeping-room fell
in, blazing up bright and fiercely just before its fall, its
concussion scattering myriads of burning flakes, which flew far up
into the sky.</p>

<p>The next instant arose such a shrill and piercing scream that it
agonised Rashleigh&rsquo;s inmost soul, for he knew it emanated
from the hapless mother just awakened to behold this dire calamity.
Next came the wailing cry of the children, shriek upon shriek, and
the vain attempts of the men to break the clumsy fastenings of the
door and windows, accompanied by many oaths and exclamations of
despair. The timber walls now began to blaze, when Ralph, seizing
an opportunity that offered by his guard&rsquo;s relaxed vigilance
for an instant, rushed towards the hut, bent on rescuing the
inmates by forcing the door. At this moment one of the constables,
having succeeded in breaking down the window shutter, jumped out of
the flames. In an instant four or five guns were discharged. The
half-escaped wretch leaped convulsively up and fell to the earth,
and immediately afterwards, Rashleigh received a violent blow from
behind on the back part of his head, which stretched him, bleeding
and insensible, on the ground.</p>

<p>When he recovered, he felt very stiff and sore; but on
attempting to rise, he found himself fastened down to the earth so
strongly as to prevent his doing so. His struggles apparently had
the effect of attracting the attention of some watchful guard, who
in a menacing tone bade him, &ldquo;Lie still, and be damned to
you, if you don&rsquo;t want another knock on the head that will
settle you altogether!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This language effectually put an end to the attempts of our
captive, who remained passive in his painful posture until the dawn
of morning; in fact, from the mode in which he was bound, he was
unable even to turn himself.</p>

<p>As soon as it became light he cast his eyes around and
discovered that the party of men, whom he had seen at the lock-up
house the night before, now lay in various positions upon the
ground near him. The spot they occupied seemed to be only sheltered
partially by an overhanging rock, and to be open to the bush on all
sides save one, and from the edge of this semi-cavern the ground
appeared to dip or sink into a valley. It was late in the morning
when some of the party arose, made a fire, and commenced preparing
breakfast, which consisted of tea made in tin quart pots, meat
broiled upon the coals, and dough cakes cooked in the same way.</p>

<p>The remainder of the party, having now got up from their various
lain, assembled round the fire, and Rashleigh then perceived that
they were seven in all, variously dressed, some clad in government
slops, and others in better habiliments, obviously unsuited to
their station in society and most probably stolen from some
settler. The nature of their avocation was now plain to Ralph.
Their arms and the outrage they had committed after rescuing their
captive leader from the lock-up spoke them to be one of those bands
of ruthless bushrangers who then roamed at large in the wilds of
Australia, carrying terror and devastation wherever they made their
appearance.</p>

<p>While he was thus commenting upon the character of his guards or
captors, and puzzling himself by vain conjectures as to what they
could propose to do with him, the party had discussed their
breakfast, which done, one of them approached our adventurer, and
casting loose part of his fastenings, bade him get up. Rashleigh
complied, and guided by the other, now approached the leader, who
had seated himself on a small hillock near the entrance of the
cavern. This man, whose name was Foxley, was of stature far above
that of his fellows, and muscular in proportion; he was dressed in
a fustian shooting-coat, with a broad riding-belt round the middle,
containing two large pistols. Shaggy cloth trousers, a blue woollen
shirt, fur cap and pampoos or rough hide boots completed his
costume.</p>

<p>His first salute to the captive was, &ldquo;Stand off, and
don&rsquo;t come too close. What were you in the lock-up
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave myself up to complain of my master,&rdquo; replied
Rashleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re one of the complaining sort, eh? Who was
your master?&rdquo; demanded the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One Arlack of Airds,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well and what did he do to you?&rdquo; enquired the
bushranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted to starve me to death and work the flesh off my
bones,&rdquo; responded Ralph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the devil didn&rsquo;t you knock the beggar&rsquo;s
brains out and take to the bush?&rdquo; asked Foxley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought it better to get away quietly,&rdquo; was
the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be revenged of the old
tyrant?&rdquo; demanded the outlaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; returned Rashleigh, with some
hesitation; &ldquo;if 1 could without murdering him or his
family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murder be damned!&rdquo; said the other fiercely.
&ldquo;If it was me, I&rsquo;d set fire to the old brute&rsquo;s
hut and burn both him and all that belonged to him in it. Bad egg,
bad bird, as we used to say long ago in Tipperary!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph made no answer to this speech; but the truculently
diabolical look that accompanied it, and a remembrance of the
dreadful catastrophe of the last night, which it naturally excited,
shot athwart his mind, and upon the recollection, too, of the
woman&rsquo;s piercing cry of horror, a shuddering fit seized our
adventurer, which was plain enough to the bushranger, who added,
with a strong expression of contempt, &ldquo;But 1 can see you are
a regular chicken-hearted crawling fool, who would stand anything
and be trampled upon like a dog rather than turn out like a man. I
wish I&rsquo;d left you in the lockup, for you an&rsquo;t worth
saving; and maybe you&rsquo;d hang us all if we was
taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, I told you so,&rdquo; said another of the party,
whose name was O&rsquo;Leary. &ldquo;I knew he was a
cur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s knock the beggar on the head, to make sure of
him,&rdquo; said a third. And many threatening expressions burst
from the rest of the party, who began to handle their weapons and
eye poor Rashleigh with looks of the most hostile import.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried the leader in a commanding voice.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have him hurt, and you know I <i>will</i>
have my way. We want somebody to carry our <i>swag</i> (plunder)
and cook our grub, for you all grumble like hell to take it in your
turns; and this fellow shall do that. It is damned hard if seven
men can&rsquo;t watch one; and if we find him out in any treachery,
he shall die like a dog, if he were twenty times my own
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this the rest grumbled a surly sort of acquiescence, and one
of them was told by the chief that for one day <i>he</i> should be
answerable for the captive, while another was warned to take charge
of him at night, this duty being thus destined to all in turns.</p>

<p>Ralph was now completely unbound and informed that he might get
his breakfast and then gather up the utensils and food in readiness
to move off when he had done. In a very short time, all being
prepared, the party set forward, Rashleigh bearing a heavy load and
being closely followed by the person who had been directed to guard
him. With this exception, no particular order appeared to be
observed, nor were they very scrupulous in preserving silence.
Indeed, from the nature of the country through which they passed,
little danger was apprehended. They travelled on some hours over a
succession of broken ranges and at nightfall they found themselves
near a small running creek, the course of which they followed for a
considerable distance. Having chosen a commodious spot, the fire
was quickly kindled and Ralph prepared a meal, which all sat down
together to partake of.</p>

<p>The conversation turned on their recent exploits. And now, for
the first time, Rashleigh had reason to believe that the whole of
the wretched inmates of the lock-up had perished miserably in the
flames, for from words dropped in broken sentences, he learned that
the man who had broken out in his sight and another who followed
him through the same outlet had both been remorselessly shot dead,
and their lifeless remains hurled into the blazing ruins. The fate
of the woman and children was left to conjecture; but as he
gathered that some of the bushrangers had stayed by the burning
lock-up house until it was completely consumed, there remained not
the slightest hope that any had escaped with life.</p>

<p>After the band had finished their meal, Rashleigh was directed
to prepare some dough for baking in the ashes, and on the flour bag
being produced, Foxley remarked that it was getting low, but it was
no matter, they would soon fill it again. From this remark and
other expressions which fell from individuals of the party, our
adventurer concluded they contemplated the commission of some fresh
act of violence very soon. It was wearing late before the party lay
down to rest; and when they did so the man who now took charge of
Rashleigh for the night handcuffed his prisoner to himself.</p>

<p>Early the next morning they arose and after taking a meal,
proceeded on their route. About midday one of the men observed he
knew, by the shape of a certain hill close by, that they were not
far from Campbelltown, which rather surprised our adventurer, as,
from his idea of the distance they had walked, he imagined they
were much nearer to Sydney, or to Liverpool at least, towards the
sea-coast; but he afterwards found that in order to avoid the
settled districts the bushrangers had made a very wide circuit,
first going towards the east and then returning westward,</p>

<p>The party now lay still in the heart of a very luxuriant
<i>scrub</i>, or thicket of bushes, which was in fact so dense that
nothing could be seen at the distance of a couple of yards. Here
the men prepared their arms, made masks to conceal their features,
and then lay quiet until dusk.</p>

<p>Shortly after nightfall they were again in motion, and having
proceeded about four miles through a tract of open forest land,
they again halted, two of the party being now sent forward to
observe the intended object of attack. On their return they
communicated their intelligence to Foxley, and all proceeded with
stealthy caution in the way indicated by these spies. The
bushrangers soon came to a narrow lane, and a dog was heard to bark
at a very small distance. After a short consultation the body was
divided, four of them getting over the right fence of the lane,
along which the others continued to proceed in silence, Rashleigh
being attached to the last-mentioned, who after proceeding a few
rods farther, arrived before a small cottage, which Ralph, to his
great pain, soon discovered was the neat little abode of Marshall,
in which he had passed so pleasant a night a few weeks before. His
consternation increased when he discovered, by the threatening
execrations of their leader, that Bob, who had once been
Foxley&rsquo;s overseer, had in that capacity procured him the
punishment of a flogging, for which the latter was now come to
exact revenge according to his own brutal code of undiscriminating
vengeance.</p>

<p>Ardently did Rashleigh pray that some lucky chance might defeat
the vindictive object of this ruthless ruffian, whose cold-blooded
atrocity, on the former occasion, had made a deep and heart-felt
impression upon the mind of our adventurer; but all seemed as
peaceful as the grave within and about the doomed dwelling. Not a
light glimmered through any opening, nor did even a dog bark
outside &mdash; a circumstance which much surprised Rashleigh, who
knew that the owner had more than six of these animals, some of
whom were tied up all day, but allowed liberty to roam about the
yards at night. And Marshall had boasted to him respecting the
vigilance of two of them in particular, who, he asserted, would not
suffer even a leaf to fall without giving the alarm, and were so
ferocious that they would tear a stranger limb from limb after
dark. He afterwards found that all these faithful guardians had
been fastened up for this occasion in a distant shed by the family,
in order to avoid any accidental <i>rencontre</i> with the company
they had invited to celebrate the christening of their youngest
child. Of this gathering, of course, the bushrangers knew nothing;
and they were consequently most amazed, while waiting the appointed
signal from their detached confederates, to hear a peal of merry
laughter emanating from some building in the rear of the cottage,
whence also soon after issued the notes of a fiddle and tambourine,
the staple music of a colonial <i>sheevo</i>, or merry-making.
There was an open gate beside the dwelling, through which the
bushrangers cautiously passed into a stockyard that seemed to
contain the building the sounds proceeded from; and on passing
round some smaller sheds, they found this to be the case, for just
before them was a large barn, through the chinks of which much
light streamed, and other indications of revelry were manifested
which audibly proclaimed the occupants of the barn were amusing
themselves with a dance. The marauders were now joined by their
four companions, who had approached by some back way.</p>

<p>The leader, Foxley, now issued his commands, that all the
outbuildings should be searched to secure any stragglers and
prevent them from escaping. This being done and no person
discovered, the bushrangers now approached the only door of the
barn, where they knocked some time without being heard; but when at
length the door was opened, and the grim array of armed and masked
figures in their uncouth and dirty dresses met the gaze of the
festive party gathered within, a scene of universal consternation
ensued. The women shrieked, the children screamed with affright,
and the men huddled themselves together.</p>

<p>Foxley now advanced into the middle of the floor, which terror
had completely cleared, and he shouted out in loud and savage
tones, &ldquo;What! Are you all scared at a few young fellows that
have come to your spree without being invited? Won&rsquo;t anybody
welcome us? No! Why, where&rsquo;s the master of the house? Ha, I
see you, Mr Marshall! Come out here&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that he very deliberately cocked his gun, which he
levelled at the unfortunate man, while those who were near him
slunk away, and he, seeing escape hopeless, reluctantly advanced
towards the bushranger, saying as he did so, &ldquo;You an&rsquo;t
a-going to murder an unarmed man, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Foxley deigned him no reply, but made a sign to one of his
comrades whose name was O&rsquo;Leary, who came to his side and
having received a whispered command from his leader, produced a
pair of handcuffs, with which he secured Marshall&rsquo;s wrists
and then retired with his prisoner.</p>

<p>Foxley now ordered all the terrified inmates of the barn to get
together on one side of the door; and two of the other bushrangers
coming in, one proceeded to search the pockets of the festive
group, and laid whatever he found upon the floor at Foxley&rsquo;s
feet. The demented ones, after having been thus closely examined,
were passed over to the other side of the barn, where they were
strictly guarded.</p>

<p>It chanced however that one of the females was attacked by some
sort of unusual fit, which produced a considerable degree of
confusion, during which a young man and woman had the address to
escape through die open door unobserved by any of the bushrangers.
Rashleigh saw them, and going round the barn, suddenly confronted
them as they were about to get over the fence.</p>

<p>The young woman, seeing him masked, shrieked; but our adventurer
made a deprecatory motion and was about to approach her when her
male companion said, &ldquo;Stand back. I dare say you are armed;
but by the heaven above us, you shan&rsquo;t lay a finger on that
girl, unless you do so over my dead body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; returned our compulsory outlaw.
&ldquo;It seems the noise the young woman has made was drowned by
the shrieks of that poor creature inside, or else you would find
others who might not be inclined to let you go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the youth; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s all
the money I&rsquo;ve got, and my watch. I&rsquo;ll give you
<i>that</i> to let <i>her</i> go. I don&rsquo;t care for
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Rashleigh, suddenly making up his
mind. &ldquo;Go, both of you. I don&rsquo;t want your money; but
for the sake of heaven, make haste in to Campbelltown and tell the
chief constable that Foxley the Murderer is here. Beg him to hurry;
or Marshall will be slaughtered and all his family. Do not delay,
as you hope for salvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run every step,&rdquo; said the girl, now
recovered from her terror; and, jumping, over the fence, both
disappeared, while Rashleigh, fearing lest he might have been
missed, crept back in the shade of the barn to the spot where he
had been placed by the bushranger who had the care of him.</p>

<p>In the mean time the sufferers in the barn having been reduced
to order by the stern threats of Foxley, the ceremony of fleecing
them proceeded anew. Both sexes underwent this ordeal, being
stripped of their money, trinkets, watches, and in several cases of
their silk handkerchiefs, coats and waistcoats to boot, until there
was a great heap of these articles of spoil upon the floor. All
were plundered in this way, which, however, was not done without
some delay, and a vast deal of tears, lamentations and entreaties
from the females, as a cherished trinket or valued scrap of finery
was snatched from its possessor by the rude hands of this unwonted
toilet assistant; but Foxley was inexorable to all the prayers,
entreaties, or all the soft artillery of blandishments with which
he was plied by the fair victims, and in reply to their most moving
supplications only ordered them to stand off.</p>

<p>At length, the whole party had been completely shorn of their
disposables and the robber now directed the clothing to be stowed
in some wheat sacks, loading his own pockets and filling his hat
with the watches money and jewellery. When this was accomplished,
the sacks were put outside the door, and all &mdash; but two, to
whom was deputed the task of guarding the prisoners in the barn
&mdash; the bushrangers withdrew into the stockyard, where
O&rsquo;Leary and poor Marshall were standing. Foxley directed them
to accompany him and Rashleigh to follow with his provision bags;
they then all went to the back door of the dwelling-house.</p>

<p>This entrance was fastened in some way; but a blow from the butt
end of Foxley&rsquo;s piece made it fly open, and all the party
went in. The interior was in darkness, and O&rsquo;Leary was
dispatched to the barn for a light. When he returned they saw a
goodly store of poultry and other eatables, ready dressed, together
with many bottles of wine and spirits, apparently prepared for
transmission to serve as a supper for the party assembled in the
barn.</p>

<p>Foxley, directing his address to Marshall, said, &ldquo;What
money have you got in the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only about four pounds,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; was the next brief demand of the
bushranger; and on being informed it was in the bedroom, he ordered
Marshall to point it out and they both withdrew.</p>

<p>Presently the noise of breaking woodwork was heard, and loud
curses from Foxley, apparently produced by disappointment at the
meagre amount of the plunder. The door being left open when they
came out, Rashleigh cast a glance into the once neat bedroom, which
was now strewn with articles of dress and bedding, broken drawers,
boxes, etc., in dire confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your tea and sugar?&rdquo; now demanded
Foxley; and the chest of tea and cask containing sugar being
indicated, Ralph, under the direction of O&rsquo;Leary, began to
fill the bags he had brought with him for this purpose.</p>

<p>While this was doing, Foxley demanded of their unwilling host
what had become of the money he had lately received for the wheat
he had sold, and was answered that it had been all paid away,
except the sum Foxley had got.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s a damned lie,&rdquo; was the
rejoinder. &ldquo;But no matter. Though I can&rsquo;t get it,
I&rsquo;ll take precious good care you don&rsquo;t live to enjoy
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor man, upon whom the stern brutality of Foxley began to
produce an effect of fear, now again asked with a tremulous voice,
&ldquo;surely you will not murder a defenceless man, who has not
done you any harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, liar!&rdquo; was all the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, think of my poor wife and helpless
children!&rdquo; persisted Marshall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of your damned tyranny!&rdquo; now roared Foxley,
suddenly removing the crape from his face. &ldquo;Look in my face,
wretch! I am Philip Foxley, that you got flogged for neglect of
work. Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; And then, sinking his voice
to a sort of half whisper of concentrated malignity. &ldquo;If you
had as many lives as I got lashes through you, aye, ten times told,
I&rsquo;d take them every one tonight. So you may make up your mind
to die .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&rsquo;ve already slaughtered eleven of my
old masters and overseers, and you shall make up the dozen!! For
I&rsquo;m a good mark. I never forget to pay my debts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marshall&rsquo;s whole frame shook with terror at the sight of a
man whose face he knew too well and whose bloodthirsty name was a
terror to the whole country; but after a, strong effort, apparently
perceiving the inutility of more entreaties, he calmed his outward
demeanour.</p>

<p>In the mean time Rashleigh had got a quantity of tea, sugar and
flour put up, to which some of the cooked food and four bottles of
spirits were added by Foxley, who then withdrew into the yard with
his prisoner. Here they were met by Mrs Marshall and her sister,
who had but just ascertained that Bob was a prisoner, and who,
driven to desperation by the idea of his probable fate, had rushed
past the guards, who did not know what to do, not liking to fire
upon two women, whom however they could not otherwise stop. They
now clung to the doomed man with frantic eagerness, demanding what
the wretches were going to do with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drag those women away!&rdquo; roared Foxley, absolutely
foaming at the mouth with fury at this further delay of his
revenge; and after a severe struggle they were brutally torn from
the arms of Marshall and forced back into the barn.</p>

<p>Foxley now directed McCoy to take charge of our adventurer and
lead him to a certain place. Next, addressing O&rsquo;Leary, he
demanded, &ldquo;Is your piece loaded with ball?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Marshall, kneel down and pray as if you mean
it,&rdquo; continued Foxley in a very cool tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give you ten minutes to make your peace with God!&rdquo; And he
took out the poor man&rsquo;s watch, which he held near a light
carried by another bushranger.</p>

<p>By this time Rashleigh, urged by McCoy, had taken up his load to
depart, and turning away, could still hear the prayers and
entreaties for mercy made by the wretched man, who seemed to
increase the intensity of his supplications as the awful moment
drew nearer. Just as our adventurer and his guide had got on a
fence and were about to cross it, the former looked back, aroused
by a yell from Foxley, which reached him like the blast of a
clarion on the breeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down! Down on your knees! Here, O&rsquo;Leary. He
won&rsquo;t pray. So be ready; and when I give the word, aim right
between his eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wretched man appeared still to be imploring his murderers
for mercy when flashes close at hand, followed by the reports of a
dozen or more muskets, appalled the bushrangers, one of whom, the
man who held the light close by Foxley&rsquo;s face, fell with a
piercing cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surrender, in the King&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; Was
vociferated by many tongues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire at the beggars and keep close together, my lads.
&rsquo;Tis your only chance!&rdquo; roared out Foxley in reply; and
again a stream of brilliant flashes gleamed on the darkness,
followed by cries of pain, rage, anger and exultation, according to
the different fortunes of those who uttered them.</p>

<p>After the bushrangers had fired their pieces, they thronged
round Foxley and all made their way to the fence, on which McCoy
and Rashleigh had remained, as it were entranced by the suddenness
of the surprise; but now, joined by the others, they were urged
into a rapid flight by the exclamations and example of Foxley, who,
with all his haste, forgot not to enquire whether their slavey
&mdash; meaning Ralph &mdash; had escaped; and on finding he had
not, he told McCoy it was a good job, for if that beggar had got
away, his life should have answered for it, an asseveration which
produced the effect of making McCoy doubly anxious for the security
of the captive.</p>

<p>The darkness of the night and the confusion of those who had
attacked them favoured the escape of the bushrangers, and having
run across Marshall&rsquo;s clearing, they gained the covert of the
standing timber unpursued. Halting now to breathe awhile, the first
care of the discomfited ruffians was to ascertain how many of their
body were missing. Three of the party were accordingly found
absent, two of whom were known to have fallen at the first fire,
but whether dead or only wounded was uncertain. After a brief rest,
they pursued their way with as much speed as possible, directing
their course eastward by the guidance of the stars; and when
daylight came they sought a deep and rugged gully, in which they
concealed themselves. But the food had been lost, together with all
their plunder, in the hurry of their flight, except the more
portable articles taken from the festive group, which had been
deposited on the persons of Foxley and McCoy.</p>

<p>Rashleigh might certainly have escaped from the bushrangers at
the time he had spoken to the two runaways behind the barn; but he
then preferred remaining until the police, whom he hoped they would
send, should arrive, thinking that perhaps something might occur in
the interim to enable him to save the poor man Marshall. His being
placed under the strict charge of McCoy and hurried away before the
constables came prevented his either doing this or joining them
later and helping to capture the ruffianly crew, whom he had come
to hate. We have seen that during their retreat, hasty as it was,
he was too closely looked after to run in any other direction than
the one pointed out to him. Deeming that at any rate
Marshall&rsquo;s life was saved for the present, he was the more
readily consoled for this disappointment, because he hoped some
opportunity must certainly occur before long to enable him to bid
adieu to his ruthless companions.</p>

<p>The party of bushrangers, after having slept a few hours, awoke
in very ill humour, as they were exceedingly hungry; and they all
united in venting their spleen upon Rashleigh, whom they asserted
might, if he had chosen, have retained and preserved the bag of
provisions. O&rsquo;Leary, who from the first had appeared to
dislike the prisoner, never allowed any opportunity of showing that
he did so to escape him, and now not only abused him heartily, but
struck him violently, and was about to repeat the blow when Foxley
interfered to prevent him. An angry altercation then ensued between
O&rsquo;Leary and the leader, who seemed to be ready to fight over
it. At the instance of the rest, who soothed and separated them, a
hollow kind of peace was restored, though Rashleigh observed the
former long afterwards muttered revengeful threats against both
himself and Foxley, casting malignant glances at them from time to
time.</p>

<p>The party, towards evening, began to consult who should venture
into Campbelltown or Liverpool, from which places they were about
equidistant, in order to purchase some necessary supplies of food.
Prior to this being arranged, Foxley called up McCoy to produce the
different articles of spoil he had carried, which being complied
with and united to those in his own custody, the whole was divided
into four parts and apportioned by lot among the surviving
bushrangers, Rashleigh not being allowed any portion. After this
distribution was over, lots were again drawn for the purpose of
ascertaining who should be their messenger, and O&rsquo;Leary being
pitched upon, he received from each a sum of money, divested
himself of his arms, and departed.</p>

<p>Shortly after he was gone, Foxley, McCoy and Smith &mdash; the
other bushranger &mdash; held a sort of consultation together, from
part of which, overheard by our adventurer, it appeared to consist
of invectives against their absent confederate O&rsquo;Leary; and
many dark hints of apprehended treachery on his part were thrown
out by the leader, who proposed they should remove from the place
in which they then were, and seek some more secluded spot before he
came back, so that, in case he should prove faithless, they might
witch him as he returned, and if he was accompanied by any one,
they might thus be enabled to fly. This being acceded to, in a
little while they all removed more than half a mile farther away,
into the bottom of a narrow valley overhung with trees. By this
time it was nearly night, and Foxley went back to lie in wait near
their first camping-ground, so that, if all was right, he might
guide O&rsquo;Leary to their new retreat.</p>

<p>Time wore on. Rashleigh and the remaining two bushrangers were
dozing near the fire; and it seemed to be late in the evening when
O&rsquo;Leary, conducted by Foxley, returned. They brought a good
store of tea, sugar, bread, and salt pork, also four bottles of
rum. Some of the meat being hastily cooked in a calabash, in
another of which some water was boiled and tea prepared, the whole
party made a hearty and most welcome meal. After this,
O&rsquo;Leary proposed they should have some grog, and produced the
tip of a bullock&rsquo;s horn to serve as a drinking-cup.</p>

<p>The present manners of this man seemed to excite some surprise
in the minds of the others, one of whom remarked that he was
getting mighty good all at once, as he pressed the others
continually to drink and did not seem anxious to do so himself,
alleging that he had drunk half a pint to his own share at
Campbelltown, where he had purchased the supplies. Rashleigh
noticed that in proportion as O&rsquo;Leary increased in gaiety,
Foxley became more gloomy and taciturn, until at last he wrapped
himself up in his skin cloak and lay down to rest, which Ralph also
did soon after. Having drunk a little of the rum, the latter
quickly fell asleep; but a sudden squall of wind, that caused the
fire near which he was lying to roar very loudly, again awoke him.
He now got up in order to remove to a greater distance from the
huge burning pile of wood. Before he again lay down, he observed
that the two men he had left sitting with O&rsquo;Leary now lay,
stretched at full length, snoring loudly and apparently insensible
from the effects of intoxication. O&rsquo;Leary himself lay at a
little distance, and Rashleigh fancied that he was not asleep;
indeed, as the latter passed him, a ruddy glare of light appeared
to sparkle from beneath his bushy brows, as if he had been watching
the movement of our adventurer, who, however, once more disposed
himself to rest, and was half asleep when he observed O&rsquo;Leary
raise his head and look furtively around towards himself and
Foxley, who was obviously deeply buried in slumber.</p>

<p>Ralph, willing to observe what O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s intentions
were, settled himself to watch, but pretended to snore,
counterfeiting sleep with all his might. In a few minutes
O&rsquo;Leary arose and taking in his hand the calabash in which
the pork had been boiled, he crept slowly and stealthily towards
McCoy and Smith, whose pieces lay beside them. Over the locks of
these he dropped a small portion of the pot liquor, and then spilt
some more upon the pistols which they wore in their belts.
O&rsquo;Leary now more cautiously approached Foxley, creeping along
upon one hand and his knees, carrying the calabash in his right
hand and an open knife in his mouth. When he had thus got dose to
Foxley&rsquo;s back, he raised himself a little and peered
cautiously into the other&rsquo;s face. Foxley lay with his gun
secured fast between his knees, but still remained soundly asleep.
After a pause, O&rsquo;Leary took something out of his pocket, and
appeared to the watchful Rashleigh bent upon turning the screw that
secured the flint which lay conveniently exposed for his
machinations, and which at last he effected, as Ralph could see by
the firelight that the flint fell out when this was done.
O&rsquo;Leary made some futile attempts to possess himself of
Foxley&rsquo;s pistols, but fearing apparently to arouse the
sleeper, he again desisted, and after a short delay, on
reattempting, managed to open both the pans and shut them softly,
thus permitting the priming to fall out. He next wetted the whole
of both the locks, after which he arose, and glancing around, took
up his musket and stealthily withdrew in the direction of
Campbelltown.</p>

<p>Rashleigh made no doubt from these proceedings that
O&rsquo;Leary was playing the traitor, as the pains he took to
render their arms useless proved that he expected an attack from
someone whom he was now most probably going to seek, that he might
guide them to the capture of his betrayed companions. Our
adventurer was now much inclined to adopt the opportunity afforded
him by the relaxed vigilance of his oppressors to withdraw and
deliver himself into the hands of the police; but he reflected that
if O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s plan proved successful, as there was every
prospect of its doing, unless he should take steps to prevent it,
they would all be tried together, in which case the traitor would
unquestionably be accepted as an approver; and his well-known
hatred to Rashleigh left no doubt of his evidence being directed to
criminate the other, no matter how guiltless, as being actively
concerned in the robbery and attempted murder of Marshall.
Independent of the certain punishment to which he would be
consigned if his guilty accession to this crime should be
considered proved &mdash; and he knew too well the weakness of any
exculpatory defence he could make, as it would be unsupported by
any other evidence than his assertion, therefore he had every just
cause, to dread such a result on the mere ground of fearing an
ignominious death &mdash; he could not besides for a moment endure
the idea that Marshall&rsquo;s wife and sister-in-law, who had
treated him with so much kindness, should suspect him of the base
ingratitude of joining in an attempt so nefarious against them.</p>

<p>Actuated therefore by these double motives, he resolved upon
denouncing the traitor to Foxley, whom he awakened for the purpose
by touching him with his foot. The bushranger sprang up at once,
gun in hand, and presenting his weapon at Rashleigh&rsquo;s head,
hurriedly exclaimed, &ldquo;Stand off, or I&rsquo;ll fire!
I&rsquo;ll never be taken alive!&rdquo; Then, seeing who it was, he
demanded angrily what he wanted.</p>

<p>Rashleigh now briefly acquainted him with the conduct of
O&rsquo;Leary and his suspicions of this man&rsquo;s treacherous
intention, which the missing gun flints and wet pistols of Foxley
too abundantly confirmed. McCoy and Smith were now awakened and
made to comprehend their danger with some difficulty, owing to the
drunken confusion of their thoughts.</p>

<p>Their fire-arms were now put in proper order, loaded and primed
anew. It was then resolved that they should all withdraw a short
distance within the covert of the thickest neighbouring shrubs,
there to await the issue of the event, Foxley&rsquo;s opossum-skin
rug and part of the other men&rsquo;s clothing being disposed in
such a manner where they had previously lain as to afford a slight
resemblance to sleeping men, that might deceive any one approaching
hastily, with only the fitful glare of the firelight to guide
him.</p>

<p>They spent more than an hour, shivering for lack of their usual
covering, in thus watching their late place of bivouac; and the
intensity of the cold, together with their eager anxiety, made the
time seem interminable. At length the noise of crackling twigs and
a slight rustling in the brushwood denoted the approach of someone.
Foxley stood next to our hero, who could not help remarking the
diabolically savage expression of his features, the compressed lips
and glaring eye-balls of the desperado evincing a ferocity and
thirst for blood which were truly appalling.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Leary first approached with cautious and stealthy steps,
like those of a cat endeavouring to surprise her winged prey. He
bore a gun in his hand, and was followed by four other well-armed
men, who emerged into the open space and looked around upon what
they thought were the sleeping robbers. After a whispered
consultation they separated and approached the places where the men
seemed to lie. Foxley now motioned the other two to follow him, and
while his opponents were still intent upon their supposed capture,
the three bushrangers levelled their pieces and fired at the
constables, one of whom fell, pierced by a ball in the forehead;
and a second dropped directly afterwards. Foxley then clubbed his
piece, and rushing upon O&rsquo;Leary before the latter, amazed at
this sudden surprise, could present his gun, he dealt the traitor
such a fell blow that the stock of the musket broke short off and
O&rsquo;Leary sank on the ground without a groan. In the mean time
the other two constables, having partially recovered from their
alarm, fired their muskets at random and hastily made off in
safety.</p>

<p>Foxley and his mates now surrounded O&rsquo;Leary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He an&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; cried Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand on one side and I&rsquo;ll blow his brains
out!&rdquo; said McCoy, cocking and presenting his gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; shouted Foxley, knocking up his
comrade&rsquo;s piece with the musket barrel he still retained.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him for your life! I would not for a
thousand pounds the traitor should die so easy a death! I&rsquo;ll
pay him off better than that.&rdquo; And fetching some water, he
bathed O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s head, until the wounded man recovered
consciousness.</p>

<p>The banditti now examined the other fallen men, one of whom they
found quite dead. While they were stripping the body naked, the
other, whose thigh was broken, got partially up, and deliberately
resting his gun on the log, took a steady aim at McCoy, who stood
beside O&rsquo;Leary and was not aware of the danger. Rashleigh saw
it, but would have cared nothing if all the three were shot, so did
not interfere; but unluckily, the bullet only whizzed close by the
bushranger, burying itself deep in the bark of a tree against which
he leaned. Foxley sprang upon the wounded wretch with his knife and
stabbed him repeatedly until the yells of the dying man, which had
at first rung through the forest, died away in inarticulate sobs,
whereupon McCoy, who had stood threateningly over the prostrate
wretch with the broken musket barrel but feared to strike while
Foxley was engaged in his brutal work, now rained a shower of blows
upon the victim&rsquo;s skull until it was actually smashed into a
shapeless pulp of hair and brains. Both bodies were now stripped
and hauled to a deep waterhole close by, into which they were
finally thrown and a number of large loose masses of stone piled on
them.</p>

<p>The ruffians then turned their attention to their living
captive, whom, traitor as he was, and ruffianly as had been his
conduct towards himself, Rashleigh could scarcely help pitying, as
he concluded the truculent wretches who had captured him no doubt
designed a fearful fate and dreadfully lingering death in expiation
of his attempted treachery. At present, however, he was safely tied
to one of the party and driven forward amid the blows and
execrations of the other two, which he endured with a sulky
silence. Rashleigh, loaded with their remaining provisions, was
obliged to accompany them, marching along in their front. In this
guise they shortly after daylight crossed the Great South Road, one
of the bushrangers first exploring the way so as to assure his
confederates that the path was free from impediment and that no
travellers were near. They now entered a tract of very gloomy and
sterile country, which seemed to descend perpetually and bore
scarcely any other than that kind of trees which in the Colony are
called forest oak, from what reason seems totally unintelligible,
as nothing, at any rate in external appearance, can be more
dissimilar than this denizen of the Australian woods from the oak
of old England.</p>

<p>At long past noon the party halted in a spot which to
Rashleigh&rsquo;s foreboding eyes appeared at any rate a fitting
scene for the horrid tragedy he feared would here ensue. Not a
blade of grass concealed the naked barrenness of the sod, which
consisted of gravel only. Not a sunbeam could penetrate the
umbrageous canopy of boughs, whose formation and evergreen hue bore
a striking resemblance to that of the funereal cypress or yew. Not
a sound disturbed the silence of the mighty world of forest, and
all nature seemed hushed in horrid anticipation of the scene of
barbarity which was about to disgrace the men here assembled, who,
though they possessed the outward semblance of humanity, yet proved
their hearts might vie with that of the tiger in ferocity.</p>

<p>Rashleigh was directed to make a fire and prepare some food, and
O&rsquo;Leary, being partially unbound, was confronted with Foxley,
who eyed him with stern malignity for a few minutes, and at length
broke silence, saying, &ldquo;Well, have you got anything to say
for yourself, you blasted wretch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other replied with a voice of concentrated hatred,
&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m only sorry that you wasn&rsquo;t all grabbed;
for there&rsquo;s nothing on earth I&rsquo;d rather see than all
three of you cowardly, blasted murdering dogs hanging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this, McCoy, who was standing close by, raised his piece, and
striking the scurrilous captive on the mouth, drove his front teeth
down his throat with the brass-bound butt end of the musket. Of
course O&rsquo;Leary fell. But the remorseless Foxley cried out,
&ldquo;Fetch some water. Throw it on him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When he
comes to, we&rsquo;ll make him fast to a tree and flog him first as
long as we can stand over him. After that we&rsquo;ll hang him up
to feed the crows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon after he was raised up perforce, as he refused to stand,
and was bound to a neighbouring tree. Foxley, now taking off a
broad leathern belt which he wore, flogged him with the buckle that
secured it until to Rashleigh&rsquo;s sickened sight it appeared as
if large pieces of flesh were actually knocked off his back at each
of the last blows. When Foxley was tired, he resigned the
instrument of torture to Smith, who again applied the scourge until
O&rsquo;Leary, ceasing gradually his dreadful shrieks and the terms
of bitter execration and abuse he had been heaping on his
tormentors, suffered his head to sink on one side and hung,
apparently lifeless, in his bonds.</p>

<p>McCoy next took the belt, saying, &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re
fainting, are you? Blast you, I&rsquo;ll bring you to.&rdquo; And
he administered a sound thrashing in his turn to the now apparently
insensible corpse, until all present really thought O&rsquo;Leary
was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your hand,&rdquo; said Foxley; &ldquo;or he
won&rsquo;t have life enough left to be worth hanging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some moments after he was taken down from the tree and Foxley
again directed water to be brought. McCoy gave him some, which he
threw over O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s head; but Smith scraped a piece of
salt pork into some water in which Rashleigh had washed other
slices; and this wretch now brought it to the seemingly lifeless
sufferer, saying, &ldquo;Clear the way. I have something will
revive him with a vengeance!&rdquo; And he began to rub their
victim&rsquo;s lacerated back with the saline fluid.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Leary almost instantly returned to consciousness, and
the intolerable anguish occasioned by this smarting application
made him howl with torment, he mingling his yells with the direst
reproaches and most biting sarcasms against his tormentors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gag the brute!&rdquo; at last said Foxley; and a short
stick having been forced into his mouth, it was tied fast at the
back of his head.</p>

<p>A cord was next made of some supple green vines, and a tree
having been selected, one of whose vast arms stretched out
horizontally at a distance of about twelve feet from the ground,
the most agile of the bushrangers climbed up with one end of the
rope, which he fastened round the limb, a running noose being
formed at the other extremity. A pile of logs was next made up
immediately under the bough in such a manner that a slight push
would throw them down again.</p>

<p>The wretched captive had watched all these movements with
foreboding eyes. He now struggled violently to rid himself from his
bonds, but in vain, biting furiously at the stick in his mouth and
speaking incoherently in his abortive rage. The dread preparations
being all made, Foxley came towards the detected traitor and began
to drag him towards the place destined for his final exit; but
O&rsquo;Leary forcibly threw himself on the earth, and it was as
much as the united exertions of Foxley and Smith could effect to
bear the struggling ruffian to his death, and no sooner had they
placed him on the logs, than his struggles knocked them all down.
At length he seemed somewhat exhausted and they contrived to secure
the rude noose around his neck. Foxley, with O&rsquo;Leary in his
arms, next got on a fallen tree and called out to his confederates
above to tighten the rope. When this was done, the robber chief
cast his burden rudely away, and O&rsquo;Leary swung to and fro,
distorting his limbs in convulsive spasms of agony.</p>

<p>Twice, through the stretching of the green vines, the rope
lengthened so much that the feet of the dying victim touched the
ground; and twice did Foxley hold his body up on high, so that his
life might at last be ended, while Rashleigh, in pity to his
prolonged agony, prayed that at least they would blow the quivering
ruffian&rsquo;s brains out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the brutal declaration of the leader.
&ldquo;I would not shorten his well-deserved struggles a single
second, for a thousand pounds! He did worse than a dog&rsquo;s
deed. and he is now dying a dog&rsquo;s death., as he
ought!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This truly dreadful scene, which harrowed every fibre in the
body of our adventurer, was at length brought to a close. The awful
death rattle and a final quivering convulsion that shook his whole
frame announced that last dread struggle of nature to be over, and
O&rsquo;Leary was a rigid breathless corpse.</p>

<p>A meal was now prepared by Rashleigh, to which his three
ruffianly companions did ample justice, making during its progress
many coarse jests and brutal allusions to the death pangs of their
treacherous associate, whose lifeless body hung within a very few
feet of the spot they had selected for their repast.</p>

<p>It may easily be conceived that our adventurer had no appetite
after the appalling scene of mortal suffering he had so recently
witnessed, and he waited most anxiously for the signal to commence
their march, so that he might at least be relieved from the sight
of the dead ruffian. But he had a task to complete that he did not
anticipate; for Foxley, seeing that he had put together the
fragments of food and their humble cooking materials, ordered him
to gather a pile of dry wood and place it beneath the body of
O&rsquo;Leary as it hung. This being quickly done, as there was
abundance of fuel at hand, one of the party applied fire to the
pile, and when it was alight another got on the limb to which the
rope was fastened, which he cut through, and the corpse fell into
the midst of the flames, while the bystanders laughed, and Foxley
remarked, &ldquo;The damned scoundrel has got a warmer bed now
he&rsquo;s dead than ever he had during his life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An additional quantity of dry timber being now thrown into the
fire, until the corpse was completely concealed from view, the
desperadoes only waited until the roaring progress of the devouring
element assured the dead bushranger&rsquo;s combustion, when they
withdrew.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">No hope arose of being freed<br>
And my dim eyes of death had need.</p>

<p>About noon the band of bushrangers and their unwilling companion
crossed the Cowpasture river upon a rude catamaran, made of apple
tree boughs tied together with vines, and in a short time had
gained the rough broken country at the foot of those lofty
mountains that traverse the whole of the centre of New Holland,
then even more solitary than it is now, the poverty of the sod
forbidding any cultivation whatever; while the natural grasses are
so scanty that they do not afford pasturage even for the indigenous
animals of Australia. Through such sterility as this they journeyed
during three days without seeing a single habitation or even a
human being. Their provisions again began to grow short, when, on
the fourth morning from the death of O&rsquo;Leary, a few hours
after they had quitted the spot of their past night&rsquo;s
sojourn, they came to the summit of a lofty range, where a prospect
equally unexpected as it was beautiful and varied burst upon the
sight of the enraptured Rashleigh, whose tormenting feelings,
induced by the fear of what fate might have in reserve for him as
punishment of his involuntary association with the desperate and
blood-stained ruffians who now formed at once his guard and his
masters, all gave way before the majesty of nature, and he drank in
large draughts of delight in contemplating the lovely scene now
expanded before him.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of his present position was a precipice
some hundred feet in height, whose ragged breast sank sheer down to
the broad expanse of the low country; but immediately at its base
the Nepean river, here narrowed to about the distance of a hundred
yards between its banks, rushed with tumultuous force around the
greater part of the hill on which they stood, from which immense
masses of rock had apparently been detached by some long past
convulsion of nature, and now lay in the bed of the torrent,
causing the rapid waters to flash around them in sheets of snowy
foam. Far to the right and left the winding convolutions of the
stream might be seen at intervals appearing through the foliage,
here in magnificent sheets of water, and anon, beyond a projecting
promontory forming a low range of hills, the river seemed
contracted into the semblance of a dazzling silvery riband that
sparkled in the beams of the morning sun.</p>

<p>In the background rose the lofty heights of gloomy mountains,
whose variously undulating sides were chiefly clad with the dark
evergreen foliage of New Holland, though here and there might be
seen upreared the giant form of some rude and fantastically shaped
peak or rifted cliff whose grey bosoms were boldly exposed in naked
sublimity. As far as the eye could reach in front was an expanse of
nearly level woodland, broken here and there by cultivated patches
of a greater or less extent, and thinly studded with solitary
farmhouses, cots and one or two hamlets with their churches.</p>

<p>The houses were for the most part embosomed in peach orchards,
whose leaves of more delicate green contrasted well with the sombre
hue of those that clad the neighbouring indigenous trees. The maize
fields, too, which were now in full blossom, and gracefully waved
their lofty tasselled tops over many an acre of the rich soil on
the river bank, formed no inconsiderable item in the charms of the
landscape, the appearance of which Rashleigh surveyed in a reverie
of pleasure, until the iron hand of Foxley smote upon his shoulder,
and his deep harsh voice demanded, &ldquo;Are you
dreaming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aroused to a sense of the dull and dread realities of his
present condition, Rashleigh turned mechanically and followed the
party, who struck more deeply among the hills. At an early hour in
the afternoon Foxley warned his mates that they were approaching
the Great Western Road, leading over the mountains to Bathurst,
which it was necessary they should cross, and therefore it behoved
them to keep a sharp look-out, that they were not surprised by any
straggling party of constables or mounted police, which were
frequently much on the alert just on the edge of the highlands in
order to prevent the escape of any of the prisoners &mdash; who at
that time were employed working in irons, in order to form the new
line of road &mdash; as the latter frequently absconded in large or
small parties, carrying plunder and havoc into the settled
districts during their brief career wherever they came.</p>

<p>The warning had scarcely been given by the leader, whose two
companions reloaded their fire-arms, when they heard a shrill cry
of a peculiar kind, which is in the Colony called a <i>cooee</i>,
and which is chiefly used by parties in the bush to denote their
positions or make known their desire of help, guidance, etc. The
bushrangers halted and listened attentively; the cry was two or
three times repeated, apparently by the same voice. At length,
after a brief consultation, McCoy went towards the place from where
the sound proceeded, while Foxley, Ralph and the other plunged into
the heart of a thicket a little apart, and in a short time the
voice of their companion who had gone to reconnoitre was heard hard
by. They now got up and went to meet him.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a short stout man seemingly past the
middle age, rather decently dressed, who carried a thick
walking-stick, and was introduced to the party by the name of
&ldquo;Mr Huggins, the overseer of No. 1 Iron Gang, who had lost
his way while looking after bushrangers&rdquo;. This introduction
was made in a very peculiar manner by his companion to Foxley, who
received it with a most significant look, in which Rashleigh
fancied he could observe traces of malignant and ferocious
satisfaction that made him shudder; while Huggins glanced
apprehensively from one to the other of the party who now stood
before him.</p>

<p>Silence was broken in a few minutes by Foxley, who said briefly
that he thought he could put Mr Huggins in the right way to find
some bushrangers very soon; at any rate he&rsquo;d &ldquo;be sure
to put him into a way that would be certain to take him
<i>home</i>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Satisfied by this ambiguous speech, Huggins placed himself under
the treacherous guidance of his foe, and they all moved on towards
the west. Ralph could hear fits and snatches of conversation
between Foxley and the newcomer, by which it appeared the former
described the party as bush constables belonging to Campbelltown,
who were in search of <i>Foxley</i> and his gang of bushrangers,
then supposed to be lurking somewhere in the fastnesses of the Blue
mountains. Imbued with this idea, Huggins talked much and long of
the necessity of putting a period to the depredations of this
notorious horde of daring scoundrels and wound up his speech by
declaring that if he (Huggins) should come across the rascal in
question, he&rsquo;d never change a word with him, but shoot him
down like a dog. Upon this declaration of his sentiments by the
overseer, Foxley turned his head to McCoy and Smith, who marched
last of the five &mdash; Rashleigh being kept in the centre &mdash;
and shot forth a glance of sarcastic contempt, twisting his
naturally coarse features into a truly Satanic as well as sardonic
grin, at the effusion; while the other two responded to the gesture
by gripping their guns more closely, with expressively grim looks
at their leader&rsquo;s companion.</p>

<p>After they had thus walked about an hour, Huggins began to be
alarmed at the duration and tendency of their journey, as they did
not reach any road. He repeatedly asked Foxley if he were certain
of being in the right direction, to which the other replied, as
before, ambiguously, that they would be &ldquo;as safe as the bank
directly&rdquo;!</p>

<p>In a few minutes more, as they were descending a very deep and
rugged glen, or gully, Foxley placed his foot before Huggins, who
of course fell some feet forward; and in order to prevent any
resistance, Foxley secured him by falling on his back. In his
overthrow, Huggins had struck his head with some force against a
stone, and before he could recover the effects of this blow his
treacherous assailants had firmly bound both his hands and
feet.</p>

<p>When the captive regained his senses, his astonishment could
only be equalled by his affright; and now, too late perceiving the
real character of his captors, he begged in the most moving terms
for mercy, abjectly supplicating for heaven&rsquo;s sake that they
would not harm him; but he might have spared this humiliation of
himself, for no tiger was ever more pitiless to his prey than the
fiend in human shape into whose power he had now fallen. No reply
whatever was vouchsafed by Foxley, who seized him by the collar,
and assisted by one of his confederates, they thus between them
partly led and partly dragged their captive to the bottom of the
narrow valley, which was a dreary spot almost inaccessible to the
light, and looking as if in fact it were a mere rift, or chasm, in
the range, formed by an earthquake, each side being chiefly shut in
by naked and jagged rocks, some of which were blackened by age
until it appeared as if they had been split by the agency of
fire.</p>

<p>A small space, level and clear from obstructions having with
some difficulty been found, Foxley seated himself upon a fallen
rock, while his companions stood before him with Huggins between
them; and now, with a smile of malignant cruelty about to be
gratified, the bushranger informed his captive, &ldquo;As you have
such a mighty great wish to see Philip Foxley, I think &rsquo;tis a
pity so reasonable and harmless a desire should not be granted; and
as you&rsquo;re a nice sort of a man, you shall have your own way
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>I am Foxley</i>. What do you think of me, eh?
You won&rsquo;t speak. Well now, that&rsquo;s what 1 call being
very ungrateful. However, it&rsquo;s no odds. As it&rsquo;s a very
great favour to see me and my mates, I mean to take care you
shan&rsquo;t tell anybody you have done so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As these words were spoken with cool and concentrated malignity
which left no doubt of the fell meaning they implied, the hapless
wretch to whom they were addressed gave himself up for lost, but
endeavoured to move his iron-hearted captor by supplications for
mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said one of the bushrangers.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me? Ay, look! What! Not know Sandy
McCoy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huggins looked at him, but shook his head and burst out into a
fresh paroxysm of lamentations and entreaties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; resumed McCoy, &ldquo;You know me too well! It
is not twelve months ago since I was under you in your infernal
gang, and one day when I wanted to go and see the doctor, you put
me in the lock-up. You left me there thirty-six hours, handcuffed
over a beam, both wrists twisted above my head, all my weight
hanging on my hands, and my toes only resting on the ground. You
delighted in nothing but tyranny, as long as you had the power. But
now, <i>our turn</i> is come; and you may say your prayers, for you
are standing on your own grave!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; remarked Foxley. &ldquo;That tricing men up to
a beam is a very common trick of his. Why, not a month ago one of
the deputy overseers was tried for killing a poor devil of a
crawler who was very sick and wanted to go to hospital; but Mr
Huggins ordered him to be triced up, and the other obeyed him, and
handcuffed the man over a pole for two days and a night. The first
night the deputy was told the man was dying; but he only answered,
&lsquo;Let him die and be damned, there&rsquo;s too many of his
sort in the country.&rsquo; So the next night, when the doctor came
at last to see him, the poor fellow was dead and stiff. That
scoundrel, though he was committed, managed to pull through it.
<i>He</i> made shift to escape from the <i>Law</i>. But I&rsquo;ll
take rattling good care <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t escape from
<i>Justice</i>, my fine fellow, for I&rsquo;m judge in this here
Court, and I never acquitted a tyrant like you in my
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Huggins threw himself on the ground in an agony of
despair. He beat his head against the earth. He knelt to Foxley,
alternately invoking blessings on his head if he would be merciful,
and denouncing the most awful imprecations if he deprived him of
his life.</p>

<p>At length Foxley roared out, &ldquo;Damn the crying beggar;
he&rsquo;ll make us all deaf. Gag him at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke thus the outlaw rose from his seat, and it appeared
to his fellows that their chief had suddenly gone mad; for he
jumped about, he threw himself down, he raved and swore most
vehemently, and as a finale to this extraordinary performance, tore
off all the clothes he had on, until he stood before them stark
naked; nor did his energetic exertions cease even then, for he
danced, whistled, sang, halloed and swore all in a breath.</p>

<p>In vain did his companions ask for many moments what was the
matter with him. At length they gathered that their chief, in the
pride of his triumph over Huggins, had sat down incautiously within
a very dangerous proximity to a huge nest of those ants which are
called by the lower classes in the Colony light-horsemen. They are
of immense size, upwards of one and a half inches long, of blue and
green colours, and the most fierce and virulently biting insects in
the bush. So long as Foxley sat quiet they did not molest him, but
the moment he put himself in motion he was stung by scores at once;
and now his whole body presented a most singular appearance, being
completely covered with swellings the size of a hazelnut, very
deeply inflamed, which arose instantaneously after the bite of
these sanguinary insects, and to judge by the grimaces of this
dauntless ruffian, who had frequently endured the most severe
floggings without wincing, the pain must have been intense. When it
was in some measure allayed, Foxley gathered his clothes, shook
them free from the intruders, and vented several bitter execrations
upon Huggins, whom he considered as the origin of his mishap, and
who now lay grovelling in the dust, completely senseless with the
agony of fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blast you!&rdquo; roared Foxley, with inexpressible
ferocity of tone and manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll waken you directly,
with a vengeance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he directed the other two bushrangers to get some bark
to twist into ropes; and this being soon accomplished, all of them
set to work making cordage, by laying two or three plies of the
inner coat of the bark up, until a good-sized line was formed by
each.</p>

<p>Foxley, who had first completed the fabrication of a stout and
tolerably long cord, next proceeded to cut a number of stakes about
two feet long, which he also pointed with his knife at one end, and
then directed the others to gather as many short logs of timber
together as they could. At length all these methodical preparations
&mdash; the meaning of which Rashleigh could not divine &mdash; had
been completed, and the ruffians approached their victim, who still
appeared paralyzed by fear.</p>

<p>He was first stripped entirely of his clothing, and then maugre
his struggles, carried, or rather dragged, along until they reached
the ant-bed. The dreadful nature of the torture intended to be
inflicted upon the helpless wretch now flashed upon the mind of our
adventurer, who had before heard of bushrangers having thus wreaked
their vengeance upon persons inimical to them; and he began by
using every argument he could think of to endeavour to move Foxley
to pity or remorse and to induce him to forbear his horrid purpose,
pointing out to him that sooner or later it must come to his turn
to suffer for the crimes he seemed so much to delight in
committing.</p>

<p>At last the patience of the bushranger gave way. He had before
only shot darksome glances at Rashleigh from beneath his shaggy
eyebrows; but now he burst out in tones of thunder, &ldquo;Hold
your infernal tongue, you blasted crawling wretch, or else
I&rsquo;ll lay you alongside of him. I know damned well that if
ever I am taken alive 1 shall swing; but that can never be while I
have one charge for a bulldog left. So while 1 live I&rsquo;ll be
revenged on all such bloody tyrants as this is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His speech was delivered with such a suitable emphasis and
seconded by so many appalling denunciations against Rashleigh as
well from the others as from Foxley, that the poor fellow was fain,
for very fear of his own life, to cease his supplications, and he
withdrew to a short distance, turning his back upon the scene. He
would now most willingly have stolen away altogether from his
ruthless companions but that he knew not which way to turn himself
and was well aware if they pursued him with success his doom would
be certain death, perhaps with additional and cruelly refined
torments. On the other hand, if he lost his way amid these pathless
mountains, there could be no doubt of his dying a miserable death
by starvation, as many others had done, who like him had wandered
away from companions on or near the only road that then traversed
that inhospitable tract.</p>

<p>After a short time a piercing yell attracted his attention and
forgetting his resolution, he involuntarily looked around. The
ruffians had now placed Huggins on the ant-bed. When he felt the
stings of the enraged insects, despair lent him herculean strength
and he burst from the grasp of his three captors. He was free!
Alas, he had run but a few yards when a stone hastily caught up in
the race by McCoy, but thrown with all the fury of disappointed
malignity, struck him between the shoulders, felling him to the
earth. Foxley now roared out for the assistance of Rashleigh,
swearing that if he did not come and aid them he should die the
death of a dog; and thus coerced, our trembling adventurer was
compelled to help carry the senseless man back to his bed of
torment.</p>

<p>Huggins was now hurled again on the ant-bed, from whence he had
so nearly escaped, and the top of which having been flattened down,
a slight trench had been made in it to receive the luckless wretch.
The insects, angered into madness at the injuries inflicted on
their storehouse, were swarming in thousands around it; but the
moment the fresh shock was felt from the fall of Huggins&rsquo;s
body, they all rushed to the spot and he was completely covered
with them directly afterwards. The bushrangers, being thus relieved
from the attacks of the furious ants, now coolly set to work, and
tied the wretched sufferer fast down with several cords passing
over his thighs and body, two to each arm and leg, and two crossing
his neck. The ends of the cords were secured to the pegs cut by
Foxley, which were now driven tight into the ground in a sloping
direction the better to retain them. The struggles of the wretched
victim to escape from these bonds, which were at length so numerous
as to form a complete network over him, were further rendered
nugatory by logs that were piled upon the cords, between his body
and the pins on every side, so that they were tightened until they
cut into the flesh.</p>

<p>All these dire arrangements were completed before Huggins had
recovered from the effects of that fatal blow which had caused his
recapture. When he again became conscious, the convulsive throes of
agony that heaved the mass of flesh, cord and logs were so
appalling that a sensation of dizzy sickness came across the brain
of Rashleigh, who fell to the earth and cut his head severely.
Perhaps the flow of blood from the wound removed his faintness, for
he felt no more of it, and was now permitted to withdraw under the
guidance and guardianship of McCoy on a search after water. It was
long before they found any of this necessary fluid; but having done
so, Ralph prepared a scanty supply of food, all that they had left.
When Foxley and Smith joined them, the former, upon noticing their
slender stock of eatables, observed that &ldquo;only it would put
that rascal (meaning Huggins) out of his pain too soon, he would go
and cut a steak off his body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perceiving that Rashleigh looked rather incredulous as well as
disgusted at this abominable idea, the truculent desperado verified
his assertion with a volley of energetic oaths, winding up the
whole by declaring, &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be a sweeter morsel
cooked for a man than the heart of a tyrant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such, it is to be observed, is the term used by all the convicts
of New South Wales to designate any person, whether magistrate,
overseer or constable, who may perform his duty more strictly than
is agreeable to the exalted notions these worthies entertain of the
deference and consideration with which they ought to be
treated.</p>

<p>After supper the party lay down to rest, and at an early hour in
the morning were again in motion up the valley, on their return
towards the western road, <i>from</i> which, it now appeared,
Foxley had turned on meeting with the ill-fated Huggins, whose lair
they now shortly passed, when what was Rashleigh&rsquo;s
astonishment, upon casting a furtive glance at the spot for an
instant, to find that nothing remained of him but bones, not quite
clean certainly, but with little indeed of flesh to be seen upon
any part, except the head, which was still nearly untouched. While
our adventurer was amazed at the voracity of these tremendous
insects, he also felt a little comforted at the idea that the
sufferer&rsquo;s death could not have been so painfully lingering
as he had anticipated; and Foxley, seeing the astonishment depicted
in Rashleigh&rsquo;s features, observed with a sort of grim
chuckle, &ldquo;Aye! Them&rsquo;s the little boys for polishing a
bone. In a few hours there won&rsquo;t be a morsel of Huggins left
but his bare skeleton.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20" id=

<p class="note">That night it was my lot to gain<br>
A reliquary and a chain. . .<br>
Demand not how the prize I hold!<br>
It was not given, or lent, or sold.</p>

<p>Upon approaching the western road, the party lay to in a
thicket, while McCoy, who was now dressed in Huggins&rsquo;s
clothes, was sent forward to reconnoitre. He carried a pistol, a
pair of handcuffs, and a letter which had been found in their
victim&rsquo;s pocket, and was instructed by Foxley, in the event
of being met and questioned, what he should say, so that he might
pass for a constable proceeding from Penrith, with a letter for
Overseer Huggins.</p>

<p>He was away nearly two hours, and on his return he reported that
the coast was clear, when the rest of the party recrossed with him
the avenue they had so much dreaded to pass. All that day they
wandered about in the vicinity of the road without food, and after
nightfall McCoy was dispatched with directions to endeavour to
procure some eatables from a station which they knew to be at no
great distance. Rashleigh, worn out by hunger and fatigue, had long
been asleep in their temporary hiding-place, when, far in the
night, their emissary returned. Our adventurer, however, was
awakened by Foxley, who bade him &ldquo;bear a hand, rouse up, and
eat that&rdquo;, at the same time throwing him a piece of bread and
a lump of <i>raw</i> salt meat, as, independent of their desire for
speed, they dared not light a fire to cook anything, being too
close to the road and settled part of the country. When he had
partly devoured this primitive meal, he was handcuffed to Smith,
who was, for the present, divested of his arms and destined with
himself to enact the part of a prisoner in charge of Foxley and
McCoy, who both of them assumed the character of constables,
escorting prisoners to Penrith lock-up house.</p>

<p>They now went boldly on to the high-road, along which they
proceeded in silence about two miles, until Rashleigh came to a
place he recognised as being on the top of Lapstone hill, the last
eminence of the Blue mountains eastward, and but a short distance
from Ralph&rsquo;s old quarters at Emu Plains. At the foot of the
hill, a usual halting place, they found two drays, the drivers of
which, according to their general practice, were encamped under
them. The sham constables here diverged from the road and went up
to the fires left alight by the travellers. The oxen were grazing
around, but the dogs quickly aroused the sleepers, of whom there
were four in all. The mock prisoners were now ordered to halt by
Foxley and McCoy, who asked if they could have a drink of water.
One of the men replied, &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo;, and gave them
some, adding that if they would wait a few minutes, some tea should
be prepared for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, neither I nor my mate,&rdquo; returned Foxley,
&ldquo;care about tea; but if you&rsquo;ve a mind to give these
poor devils of prisoners any, I dare say they would be glad of a
feed, before they get to their journey&rsquo;s end in the
<i>chokey</i> (lock-up).&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s like to be the end of their
travels,&rdquo; observed the kind-hearted bullock-driver, &ldquo;I
pity them, with all my heart.&rdquo; And he half-filled a large
iron pot in order to boil it for tea.</p>

<p>The rest of the travellers were now assembled round the fire,
helping to get ready a feed; for these wayfarers on the roads of
New South Wales were at that time remarkably hospitable, as their
erratic mode of life placed them completely at the mercy of any of
the many small bands of armed plunderers who were so frequently
levying contributions on the King&rsquo;s highway in those days;
and the ordinary carriers always paid great court to the convict
population, perhaps imagining they might often escape being
plundered, if they could only acquire the name of good fellows
among that class. In the present case, therefore, while they
treated the supposed constables with only <i>ordinary</i> civility,
they paid most solicitous attention to their sham prisoners,
supplying them with pipes and tobacco, and hastening the
preparation of food for their use.</p>

<p>At length, all being ready, the new-comers sat down to eat,
their hosts excusing themselves from joining in the repast, upon
the ground that they had supped at a very late hour, and they sat
in various positions telling, or seeking after news. At length one
of the bullock-drivers asked what the prisoners were charged with,
and McCoy replied, &ldquo;They are <i>bolters</i> (runaway
convicts). They belonged to that mob of Foxley the
bushranger&rsquo;s; but they won&rsquo;t tell us where we could
find him, or else we&rsquo;d very soon have him as well as
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name of Foxley caused an instant sensation. All the
travellers began at once to question their visitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Foxley near this? &mdash; How long since he&rsquo;d
been heard of? &mdash; What way was it thought he was going?&rdquo;
And the last querist enquired what was the last robbery or murder
he had done.</p>

<p>To these hasty queries McCoy replied that it was thought Foxley
was now somewhere near Bathurst, but had been heard of going back
to the south, where he had lately been robbing all the country,
concluding by stating that &ldquo;Foxley might be a great terror to
the south country constables, but he only wished that himself and
his mate could come across the scoundrel, that was all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the elder of the bullock-drivers very politically
observed, &ldquo;For my part, I&rsquo;d like to make a
child&rsquo;s bargain with Foxley: let be for let be. For folks
<i>do</i> say he&rsquo;s a regular devil, a complete fire-eater;
and at any rate, it don&rsquo;t answer, you know, for us folks
that&rsquo;s on the road to be meeting with gentlemen of his sort
very often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och, botheration to your clack,&rdquo; now struck in a
sprightly Hibernian among the travellers, whose face betokened his
unquestionable Milesian origin. &ldquo;What a clatter you keep
about Foxley! As if nobody knew anything about him at all at all
but yourself. Sure, an&rsquo;t Phil Foxley my own uncle&rsquo;s
wife&rsquo;s shister&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s sixth cousin? And
oughtn&rsquo;t I to know him, whin we used to be gossoons together
playing at hurley in ould Ireland? And mark my words, sure
you&rsquo;d see if Phil was forenenst me <i>now</i>&rdquo; (and the
speaker looked direct at Foxley) &ldquo;all that would be in id:
he&rsquo;d say at wanst, &lsquo;Murtagh Cassidy, my jewel, is id
yourself that&rsquo;s in id?&rsquo; And he&rsquo;d thrate me to the
besht that was to be got!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did you ever see Foxley since you came to this
country?&rdquo; now enquired McCoy, having been prompted to ask
this ingenious gentleman the question by the real Simon Pure, who
in fact appeared much to enjoy the rhodomontade of his Irish
relation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is id me see him?&rdquo; responded the other, nothing
abashed. &ldquo;Faix thin, Mr Consthable, maybe id&rsquo;s wanting
to thrap me you are, in the regard ov my poor cuzin Phil,
bein&rsquo; onlooky and the like. But, you see, I&rsquo;ll only
tell you I seen him a good many times in the counthry, and I
won&rsquo;t tell you neither whin nor whare we met. So you
can&rsquo;t take no hould of that, you see. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean
any harm,&rdquo; replied McCoy; &ldquo;but only I&rsquo;d like to
know what like a man he is in size, as everybody talks so much
about him. I&rsquo;ve got a description of him from the runaway
list; but then, that was took a long time ago, when he first came
to the country, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och faix. As to that, if id&rsquo;s your look to take the
poor boy a presnor, &lsquo;why, God&rsquo;s will be done! What
soort of a man is he, agrah? Faix thin, he looks just like meself;
and we used always to be took for brothers even, if you plaze, whin
we&rsquo;d be together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the <i>only</i> difference between the appearance of Foxley
and his veracious pretended kinsman were these: the former was as
swarthy as an Italian, the latter as red as a fox; Philip was about
sixteen stone weight, Murtagh not more than seven; Foxley was a
strongly built, muscular and well-proportioned man, Cassidy was a
little lean fretful-looking being, with ferret eyes, fiery hair and
a confirmed snub nose. So, after all, their general favour could
never have been so exceedingly alike, but the fact was, the whole
tale was no more than a pure invention of the fertile brain of this
ingenious off-side bullock-driver, who was very fond of what is by
the vulgar in the Colony called &ldquo;lifting himself&rdquo;, that
is, seeking for respect from others at the expense of truth.</p>

<p>Another of the bullock-drivers hereupon observed,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for you to talk about such things;
but I should only just like to know whether there is any chance of
our falling in with the same Foxley, for I could guess what to do
in such a case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the bushranger chief. &ldquo;Then I
can tell you I have real good reasons for believing that Phil
Foxley is not so far off as my mate here seems to think. In fact, I
am certain I have been quite close to him this very day, and
I&rsquo;ll swear I will be alongside of him tonight yet, let him
look as sharp as he likes; for I won&rsquo;t sleep until I do. But,
you know, when we came across these two men, we was forced to take
them to the lock-up before we could go after the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, if he&rsquo;s so close as that,&rdquo;
returned the bullock-driver, &ldquo;we must begin to look a little
sharp, for he may be paying us a visit, if he knows we are on the
road. I&rsquo;ll just get my musket ready, and I&rsquo;d advise you
to do the same, Jem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, Jem and the last speaker disappeared under the dray
and presently returned with two old soldiers&rsquo; firelocks,
which they began to arrange. Jem remarked that the charge had been
so long in his gun he should draw it out, and began to do so; but
Foxley, seeing that the screw on the end of his ram-rod was broken,
offered to do it for him, and the other thanked him, resigning the
weapon for this purpose.</p>

<p>In the mean time McCoy had got hold of the other man&rsquo;s
piece under pretence of looking at it. He turned round to Foxley.
Their eyes met. Both lay down the travellers&rsquo; muskets and
presented their own at the astonished bullock-drivers, whom they
ordered to stand still on peril of their lives. &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
added Foxley, in a tone of thunder, &ldquo;I am Foxley the
bushranger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Cassidy at that moment was stooping to light his pipe;
but no sooner did he hear this dreaded mandate than, letting fall
both pipe and knife into the fire in a paroxysm of fright, he
leaped backwards over a heap of bullock bows, yokes and chains and
ran off with the speed of a hunted deer.</p>

<p>McCoy presented his piece; but Foxley, who burst into an
uproarious fit of laughter at the hasty retreat of his so-called
cousin, thrust up the muzzle of the other&rsquo;s musket, and as
soon as he could speak cried, &ldquo;Damn him, how he runs away
from his relation. Come back, you fool, to <i>your cousin phil</i>!
No. he won&rsquo;t! Well then, blast him, let him run. He
can&rsquo;t get any help within three miles, at any rate, and I
strongly suspect he&rsquo;s too much bothered by his fright to know
what way to go to look for it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The handcuffs were now taken off the pretended prisoners. Smith,
being equipped with a gun, was posted as a guard over the remaining
three travellers, whose persons were then closely searched by
McCoy, who deprived them of their valuables with considerable
address and some jokes as to how nicely they were taken in by the
supposed constables. In the mean time Foxley had nearly unloaded
both the bullock drays and selected such articles as he thought fit
from their lading, all this being completed in a marvellously short
space of time. The bullock-drivers were lashed fast to the poles
and wheel of their drays, and the bushrangers, heavily laden,
departed under the guidance of their chief.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood seemed to be quite familiar to Foxley, who led
them by a most circuitous route until they again reached the foot
of the mountains, where they are washed by the Nepean at the
northern end of the Emu Plains. Here, in a most sequestered spot,
they halted as the morning dawned, and took their first regular
meal for forty-eight hours; after this they examined their booty,
which comprised half a chest of tea, a bag of Mauritius sugar, a
basket of Brazilian tobacco and a quantity of wearing apparel,
shawls and handkerchiefs. They had also secured some flour and
pork, and fancied themselves freed from apprehensions of famine, at
least for a week. The greater part of the day was spent in sleep,
and at the approach of night, McCoy was again dispatched to
reconnoitre. After a short absence he returned and led the party to
the river bank at a spot where they found a large bark canoe, which
it seemed he had stolen from some settler&rsquo;s wharf hard
by.</p>

<p>In this they paddled along very softly for some hours, keeping
under the shade of the mountains as much as possible, for the
opposite bank of the river was crowded with human habitations, and
it was sometimes so narrow that even the slight noise they
unavoidably made in using their rude oars alarmed the
farmers&rsquo; dogs, who ran along the shore baying with all their
might and thus aroused their masters and mistresses, who then
appeared in grotesque groups on the heights beside the stream,
bearing bark torches in their hands, and hailing, to know whether
there was anyone upon the river. But as the depredators in the
canoe, of course, did not choose to reply, and as the precautions
taken by these good folks in bringing out their flaring flambeaux
effectually prevented themselves from seeing any object at the
distance of a dozen yards from their noses, they could not discover
the cause of the incessant din created by their wiser as well as
more sharp-sighted canine guardians, and the party proceeded
unmolested until the first blush of dawn tinged the eastern sky;
when, finding themselves near a favourable spot, they ran their
canoe close in among the reeds, unloaded her, concealed their cargo
in various places, and then betook themselves to a fastness in the
North Rocks, where they slept without fear.</p>

<p>Upon awakening in the evening, Foxley and McCoy had a short
conversation with Smith, and leaving him, as it seemed, to watch
Rashleigh, they set off towards the river. From conversation with
his companion in their absence, Ralph discovered that their present
hiding-place was the North Rocks, near Richmond, and that the other
two bushrangers had now gone to that place in order to find out a
purchaser for the fruits of their enterprise. They did not return
until very early in the morning, when all of the party set to work
collecting the goods they had hidden, and placing them together,
the person with whom they had agreed to become a purchaser being
expected every moment.</p>

<p>There was a man, at that time, whom every person in the
neighbourhood of Richmond knew by the name of <i>Sobersides</i>.
Originally a prisoner, and one of the greatest scamps even among
that most scampish body, he for a very long period endeavoured to
acquire the <i>enviable</i> notoriety of a flash man; that is, in
the terms of the immortal Shakspeare,</p>

<p><i>A ruffian that will swear, drink, dance</i>,<br>
<i>Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit</i><br>
<i>The oldest sins the newest kind of ways</i>!</p>

<p>But alas, he found that fame did not flow upon him so quickly
through this channel as he had expected, probably owing to the
number of skilful competitors with whom he had to contend in the
race for this very <i>amiable</i> distinction. He therefore
suddenly altered his whole plan, and, as many other vulgar-minded
men in New South Wales have done, nay, are daily doing after a long
career of villainy, Mr Sobersides turned hypocrite, no doubt
expecting that the &eacute;clat which was denied to his previous
course of atrocity would readily be granted to the brilliant
novelty of his conversion. And in his common daily conversation,
which had heretofore been a disgusting olla-podrida of the most
brutal sensuality and soul-destroying imprecations, he now
expatiated with vast unction upon the marvellous power of grace
which had plucked him, as it were, like a brand from the burning,
and delivered him from the domination of the world, the flesh and
the devil!</p>

<p>So great a proficient did this consummate schemer become in his
new art that his hypocrisy very shortly deceived both the village
parson, who appointed him his clerk and sexton, and the village
magistrate, who appointed him district constable. In this united
capacity Mr Sobersides had now continued to officiate for several
years, during the course of which he contrived to accumulate a very
considerable portion of the world&rsquo;s wealth; the rather that
though he was extremely Pharisaical in his outward deportment, and
no man could utter the responses on Sunday in his elevated station
before the assembled inhabitants with a more solemn and edifyingly
sanctified tone, yet he, in truth, possessed a most accommodating
conscience, and never scrupled to overlook any violation of the
law, so long as he obtained good and sufficient reasons of
<i>Sterling</i> <i>weight</i> for doing so. But it is to be
observed that he invariably atoned for his deviations from the
strict line of duty in favour of those who <i>could</i> pay him
well for his lenity, by a double portion of rigour towards all
those rapscallions who, though they were so poor as to be unable to
afford the harbinger of justice a <i>douceur</i>, yet had the
unparalleled audacity to commit a breach of law or decorum, and
<i>their</i> slightest faults were always magnified by him into
crimes of heinous turpidity before &ldquo;Their
<i>washups</i>&rdquo; until he thus became a perfect terror to all
the miserable wretches of government men in his neighbourhood who
fell under the displeasure of their masters for non-performance of
the allotted quota of labour which the government regulations of
that day exacted from each assigned convict.</p>

<p>Such was Mr Sobersides, whose terror to the minute fry of
evil-doers illustrated the saying that &ldquo;laws are like
cobwebs, which catch the small flies, but allow the large ones to
escape&rdquo;; and his fame for pitiless execution of his duty
having long before extended to Emu Plains, it may be supposed that
Rashleigh&rsquo;s astonishment was great when he saw this vigilant
conservator of public peace and morality appear in the North Rocks
in the capacity of a customer for the spoils of the lawless Foxley
and his desperate associates, whose freebooting exploits, it
seemed, he had often before profited by, heedless that by so doing
he supported and encouraged a band of bloodthirsty ruffians who
would stop at the commission of no act of atrocity to glut their
eager desire for spoil.</p>

<p>In order to guard against any unpleasant recognition in after
times on the part of their visitor, the bushrangers all wore pieces
of crape upon their faces and were directed by Foxley not to speak
during the bargain, which was to be carried on solely by himself.
From the easy and unrestrained manner of both parties, it was
evident they had frequently transacted business together before;
nor were they long at present in making a deal, when he departed,
leaving behind him a sack full of empty bags, into which the tea,
sugar and other articles were transferred from their original
packages. The replenished sacks were stowed away in a secret nook,
the tea chest, bags and basket, which had been taken from the dray,
being carefully buried by the bushrangers.</p>

<p>The latter now retreated to a place of security in the
neighbourhood, where the day was spent subsequently in sleeping by
Foxley and McCoy, who had apparently been up all night, Smith and
Rashleigh being directed to maintain a sharp look-out; though from
the nature of their present nearly inaccessible retreat there was
indeed little danger of interruption.</p>

<p>The North Rocks of Richmond is the name given to a most singular
valley that appears to have suffered some extraordinary convulsion
of nature, being completely filled with immense masses of stone,
apparently vomited out of the bowels of the earth by the agency of
an earthquake, and left lying wherever chance had directed their
fall, so that it was absolutely choked with</p>

<p><i>Rocks, mounds, and crags, confusedly hurled</i>,<br>
<i>The relics of an earlier world</i>.</p>

<p>At the upper end of this valley rises a precipitous hill, in the
face of which appear many horizontal chasms. One of these, in
particular, near its base, though possessing a very low entrance,
is internally of great extent, and in most places from ten to
twelve feet high. The floor of this cavern is composed of the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the sandstone that forms one stratum of the
hill, and is perfectly dry, save in a corner, where a single drop
of pellucid water continually falls from a joint in the rock; and
this, through its long sustained action, has worn a basin about two
feet wide and eighteen inches in depth, which is constantly full of
most beautifully clear and cold water.</p>

<p>At the opposite side of the cavern from this spring is a narrow
perpendicular slit in the rocky roof, open to the heavens, but
fringed with brushwood so as to be nearly invisible from any
distance, either above or beneath. This orifice admits a
considerable quantity of light to the interior of the cave, which
was selected for their retreat by Foxley, who had obviously made
use of it for a similar purpose before, as he led the way to the
opening, that admitted them without any difficulty, though it was
so very low and well concealed by an overhanging rock that any
person unaware of its existence might pass to and fro its front
daily for years and still never discover it. In fact, it was
necessary to creep into it on all fours; but after their having
gone a few feet in this manner, the rock that formed its roof
receded so much that the tallest man could stand erect. In this
secluded spot did the party of bushrangers spend the rest of the
day. A fire was made under the cleft before spoken of, on a spot
that indicated having been appropriated to the same purpose before,
and the materials for which they found lying near.</p>

<p>At nightfall they conveyed their plunder to the bank of the
river under the guidance of Foxley, and very shortly after they had
done so could observe, from the concealment in which they stood,
that a boat approached, sculled by a single person, who proved to
be Mr Sobersides, bearing the money agreed on between himself and
Foxley as the price of the spoil. A few moments served to transfer
the bags into the boat, which now disappeared, and the marauders
retraced their steps towards the cavern, as it seemed to Rashleigh;
but after travelling a short distance, the leader and his two
companions held a consultation which ended in their turning
abruptly again towards the river and reaching the bank at a
different spot to the one they had so lately quitted. McCoy now
searched among the reeds for some time, and then called to the
others, who, on obeying his summons, found him guiding a catamaran,
upon which they all got and quickly crossed the stream.</p>

<p>After they had ascended the high river bank, many lights were
visible, and the busy hum of voices was heard directly in their
route. Foxley and McCoy walked on either side of Rashleigh, whom
the former cautioned to be silent, and they thus went on for about
half an hour, until they had left the greater part of the houses
behind. They then halted and McCoy went forward alone; but upon his
returning in a few moments, the whole party again proceeded and
presently arrived at a house standing by itself. Lights appeared
within and the voice of a female was heard singing. Foxley tapped
at the door and the travellers were admitted.</p>

<p>The apartment was a spacious one, of the usual humble order as
regards furniture, etc., with those belonging to the greater
portion of settlers; still, from many circumstances, it was obvious
the occupants of the dwelling were in easy circumstances. The
female that admitted them was a young and handsome Australian, who
appeared overjoyed to see McCoy, whom she welcomed with many
kisses. in a few moments two other girls and an elderly man and
woman came in, who seemed happy to see the new arrivals, to whom
food was pressingly offered, but declined by all; and McCoy, taking
one of the girls aside, spoke something to her, finishing his
conversation by giving her money. She went Out, and Foxley and
Smith, who had by this time attached themselves to the other two
girls, maintained a conversation with them, abounding, as it
seemed, with some very merry topics, for ever and anon a loud and
hearty peal of laughter accompanied their sallies.</p>

<p>The absent fair one now returned, bringing on her head a keg,
the arrival of which was hailed with acclamations; and the party,
excepting our adventurer, drew up to the table. Cards were
produced, rum served round, and all preparations made for spending
a social evening. Foxley had told Rashleigh, before he joined the
group at the table, to sit in a certain part of the room, warning
him that if he offered to leave it but for one instant without
acquainting either himself or McCoy, then he would shoot him dead;
and he cocked one of the pistols he wore at his belt, with a glance
that spoke volumes, as he whispered this caution.</p>

<p>Near to the stool on which our adventurer was seated there was a
table with a few books. One of these he found to be the <i>Arabian
nights</i>, which was wonderfully tattered and dog&rsquo;s-cared,
while a volume alongside of it, <i>The whole duty of man</i>, was
scarcely soiled, and though of an ancient edition, had more than
half its leaves uncut. Rashleigh took the former and was quickly
lost to all sense of the outer world, as well as the noisy mirth of
the group around him, while perusing its pages, which frequently
filled him with painful recollections, as it reminded him of the
happy and guiltless days of his youth, when he had last delighted
in the gorgeous delineations of Oriental magnificence with which
these tales abound.</p>

<p>In the mean time his companions were rapidly getting furious
with intoxication. They began to sing, to bellow and to rave, until
at length, Foxley&rsquo;s eye resting upon Ralph, he got up,
staggered towards him, and asked what was the reason he did not
drink; was he too much of a gentleman for his company? In vain did
the other assure his tyrant that he had drunk abundantly and
proffered evidence of his having just emptied a teacup full of rum
and water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tea-cup!&rdquo; hiccupped the desperado. &ldquo;To the
devil with such an egg shell as a tea-cup.&rdquo; And going to the
fireplace, he seized on an empty quart pot which, after spilling a
great deal, he at length succeeded in filling with raw rum from the
keg.</p>

<p>Then, returning with it, he addressed his prisoner thus,
&ldquo;Here, damn your snivelling carcase. Take that and drink it
off, directly. Do you think I&rsquo;m going to let you keep sober
while we all get drunk, so that you may go and bring the bloody
<i>traps</i> (constables) upon us? So drink that at once,
d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh remonstrated. The eyes of Foxley flashed fire; he drew
the cocked pistol from his waist and presented it full at
Rashleigh&rsquo;s head, roaring, &ldquo;Drink, you beggar, or
die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This effectually put a stop to any further scruples, so our
wretched adventurer took the pot and raised it to his lips, while
Foxley kept on shouting, &ldquo;Down with it, every drop,&rdquo;
still menacing with the pistol. Thus perforce compelled, Ralph
drained the vessel of its burning contents. A savage laugh of
exultation rang in his ears, and he sank senseless on the
floor.</p>

<p>When Rashleigh recovered his consciousness, he was oppressed
with a sensation of parching thirst. The torments of the damned
raged in his whole frame. He attempted to rise, but fell again to
the earth. He strove to speak, but his tongue clave to the roof of
his mouth, and he thus lay in agony, but perfectly sensible. In a
little while he heard the voice of Foxley, engaged in conversation
with a female. They appeared to have been awakened by the noise of
Ralph&rsquo;s fall, and were sleeping in the same room at no great
distance from him. Presently their alarm respecting the disturbance
subsided, and their conversation took another rum, in the course of
which the female seemed anxious to impress upon the mind of Foxley
the magnitude of some booty that he would acquire by engaging in a
certain enterprise, which, it appeared, they had been conversing
about before, winding up her exordium by saying that she should
soon find out whether her present bedfellow really loved her, as,
if he did, he would not let that saucy Nancy Doughboy wear a silk
gown while she had only a printed one! To all this Foxley replied
in a suitable manner, so as to remove any doubts of his resolution
from the mind of his <i>ch&egrave;re amie</i>, and silence was soon
again restored.</p>

<p>This dialogue set our adventurer&rsquo;s rum-bewildered brains
in a complete ferment, for by it he well knew some new and most
probably atrocious act of turpitude was resolved upon by Foxley;
and the state of Rashleigh&rsquo;s sensorium conjured up the most
appalling visions of demons, furies and disembodied spirits
colleagued to punish his wicked and guilty companions as well as to
lavish torments upon himself for being even their unwilling
associate. Never did poor mortal pass hours of such intense pain,
both bodily and mental; but the former, sharp though it was, almost
enough to bid his throbbing temples split, was yet as nothing to
the latter, for his diseased imagination presented the most vivid
representation to his inward vision of the last dread place of
final torment spread with lakes of never-dying flame, where foul
and gibbering monster fiends of all kind of hideous and
indescribable shapes exhausted their ingenuity in inventing fresh
and unendurable tortures for himself and the bushrangers.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21" id=
"Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21</b>
</h2>

<p class="note">Dogs! Think of your chiefs by this hand that were
slain.<br>
Exhaust all your tortures, you try them in vain;<br>
For the chief of Oswego shall never complain.</p>

<p>Long ere dawn the next day the bushrangers were afoot, bringing
with them the wretched Rashleigh, who, though he was perforce
compelled to swallow a large draught of the fiery spirit that
morning to revive his prostrate energies, yet felt so ill that he
would fain obtain permission to lie down and die. And never did he
hail a place of repose with more heartfelt joy than spread itself
over him when they at length arrived at the cavern and he was at
liberty to stretch his palsied limbs upon the rocky floor of that
secure retreat.</p>

<p>Here he lay all day in a state of semi-insensibility, until, in
the evening, he was aroused by the full deep tones of Foxley, who
ordered him to get up directly and come along with them, a command
which he was fain to obey, though every nerve in his body trembled
like the leaves of an aspen through the latent effects of his
involuntary but deep debauch.</p>

<p>The moon was in its first quarter, and its pale light was just
glimmering above the trees when the little band of plunderers set
forth from their hiding-place, as Rashleigh doubted not, upon
remembering the last night&rsquo;s conversation, to carry havoc,
and perhaps slaughter, to some peaceful fireside. By the great
caution evinced among the party, it was evident they feared
detection more than was their custom, and the oft-repeated baying
of watch-dogs near them proved that human habitations were numerous
and close to the route they were pursuing.</p>

<p>For some hours they continued their journey in silence and at
length entered a spacious clearing, in the centre of which a
cluster of huts appeared, that they boldly approached. All was
silent within, nor was there any light to be seen, and the outer
door being fastened only by a latch, the whole party soon stood in
an apartment which served the usual purposes of dining-room and
kitchen to the family, none of whom were yet apparently awake;
though many dogs, who had probably been absent at the critical
moment of the marauders&rsquo; approach, were now exerting their
vigilance too late, by baying most furiously around the door, which
some of them were making fierce efforts to open, but in vain, for
the uninvited visitors had taken the precaution of shutting it fast
behind them.</p>

<p>A light was obtained by McCoy, and at that instant a man clad in
sleeping dress came out of an inner apartment to that occupied by
the intruders, grumbling, as he came forth, sundry drowsy
imprecations against the dogs for their clamour. He had, however,
scarce placed his foot upon the floor of the outer room when the
hand of Foxley upon his shoulder and the muzzle of a pistol
presented at his forehead caused him to start and utter an
equivocal sound, which the robber at once checked by growling in a
suppressed tone, &ldquo;Silence! On your life! Or I&rsquo;ll drive
a brace of bullets through your skull!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Foxley then dragged him to the opposite side of the room, when
he continued, &ldquo;What men are there asleep in the
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only my two sons and a stranger,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; was the next demand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In yonder,&rdquo; returned the old man, shaking as if
with an ague fit, and pointing out a door different from that at
which himself had entered.</p>

<p>Foxley now, with a mute motion to Smith that he should guard the
settler, took a light, entered the room with McCoy, and soon his
rude voice was heard arousing the inmates, who then, to the number
of three, as the old man had said, came forth in their shirts and
were ordered to take their places beside the first prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Foxley, addressing the old farmer,
&ldquo;call your wife and daughters out here; but mind! if
there&rsquo;s any more <i>men</i>, even another one, he shall die
and all of you too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The women soon made their appearance, pale, disordered and
trembling; but McCoy desired them to lay aside their fears,
assuring them no harm was intended to their personal safety, an
assurance which was echoed by Foxley, who ordered the mistress of
the house and her daughters to prepare a feed for all the
party.</p>

<p>While this <i>request</i> was being complied with, Foxley spoke
to the settler himself, who now stood motionless in the corner
where he had been placed, evidently suppressing strong feelings of
indignation at the unceremonious behaviour of the bushranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr Shanavan,&rdquo; said the robber chief,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been informed that you came up from Sydney with a
swag of property the other day. I mean to have my share of it. So
look sharp and bring it out here to the light; and mind that there
is not one article deficient in the lot you bought; for if there is
I shall be able to tell in a minute and I&rsquo;ll <i>cob</i> you
within an inch of your life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where is it?&rdquo;
resumed the ruffian after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my bedroom,&rdquo; stammered out the old man at
length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come with me,&rdquo; was the next direction given by
the outlaw in such a tone of command that Shanavan dared not deny
him, and taking up a lamp, he marshalled the bold intruder into
another room.</p>

<p>In the mean time Smith the bushranger had been steadfastly
looking in the face of the stranger whose ill fortune had brought
him that night to partake of Shanavan&rsquo;s hospitality, and who
was now standing beside the two young men, sons of his host. This
man did not seem at all easy under the scrutiny of Smith and
repeatedly changed his position in order to evade the ruthless gaze
of the other, which was evidently fraught with no kindly
meaning.</p>

<p>At length Foxley returned with the master of the house, whom he
compelled to carry out a quantity of wearing apparel and other
goods, which were consigned to the care of McCoy.</p>

<p>Smith now addressed his leader thus, &ldquo;I say, Foxley. who
do you think we ve nailed upon the ground hop at last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell, I&rsquo;m sure. Who is it?&rdquo;
replied the other, examining the man whom Smith&rsquo;s gesture
indicated, but whose face was now hidden from view, until the
bushranger, stepping over to him, laid hold of that ear which was
nearest to him, and with a sudden jerk, turned his head completely
round to the light, saying, as he did so, in tones of the coarsest
sarcasm, &ldquo;Come, Mr McGuffin, let us have a look at your
pretty <i>mug</i> (face). You didn&rsquo;t use to be so
bashful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;tis McGuffin the tyrant!&rdquo; roared Foxley
in tones of savage triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well say that,&rdquo; rejoined Smith. &ldquo;Why,
the very last time I ever saw him, he flogged our whole gang,
fifteen in number, overseer and all, giving all us that were
working hands fifty lashes each, and the overseer a hundred without
being charged with any crime, and of course without the shadow of a
trial; and when jack Bunn, the overseer, as good a fellow as ever
broke the world&rsquo;s bread, asked what we were all to be flogged
for, this scoundrel said, &lsquo;Why, to keep the hair out of your
eyes, to be sure, you rascal!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye. I know him well by report!&rdquo; now remarked
Foxley. &ldquo;An&rsquo;t he the beautiful inspector of falling
parties that Major Fireplace got the Governor to grant power to, so
that he might flog any or all the men in the gangs under him
without the trouble of bringing them to Court? And ever since that
time, hasn&rsquo;t he gone about on horseback all through the
country, with a flogger at his heels for a running footman, sarving
out stripes to all and sundry, so as to show, not only that he had
got the power, but also that he was determined not to let it go to
sleep in his hands. And now, my gentleman, <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> got
<i>you</i>. I&rsquo;ll try if I can&rsquo;t clear off all scores
with you. At any rate, you&rsquo;ve sarved out your last
slops!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>McGuffin. who was a tall, weather-beaten, dark-complexioned man
with unusually stern and determined features, seemed quite appalled
by the ferocity of Foxley&rsquo;s tone and manner when the latter
began to talk; but by the close of the robber&rsquo;s speech he
recovered self-possession, and said, in a cone as resolved and
stern as that of the other, &ldquo;Well, you infernal,
cold-blooded, murdering, treacherous ruffian, and what can you do
after all but <i>only</i> take my life? And that you may do and be
damned, if you like. Yes, I have had hundreds of such crawling
caterpillars as you and your mob well flogged before now, and
I&rsquo;ve got one comfort left yet. It is this, that neither God
nor man can much longer keep you from the gallows; for the Devil
has almost done with you, and Jack Ketch must soon get his due in
choking you and your loblolly boys. So you may do your worst, for I
defy you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bushrangers appeared paralyzed by his indomitable boldness.
At almost his first word Foxley had taken a pistol from his belt,
which he deliberately cocked, and with a scornful sneer, as coolly
levelled at the captive&rsquo;s head, still, as it seemed,
suspending his final purpose, though his brow, true index to a
tragic page, grew black with the darkness of tenfold night. As for
Smith and McCoy, they stood gaping at McGuffin as though they were
charmed with the audacity of his defiance; but the instant he had
ceased to speak, McCoy, whose face was perfectly livid with the
intensity of his rage, lifted his musket and felled the prisoner to
the earth with the butt end of his weapon; while a loud shriek
burst from one of the girls, who dropped senseless on the
floor.</p>

<p>Foxley sprang up and said, &ldquo;Now, by all my hopes of deep
and black revenge, I&rsquo;m glad you knocked the bragging bully
down! For I was just that instant going to shoot him, and it would
have been ten thousand pities he should get such an easy death! Is
he hurt much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This query being satisfactorily replied to, Foxley next demanded
what had ailed the girl who cried out, and having elicited that she
had fainted through fear at the fate she supposed intended for
McGuffin, to whom she was about to be married, the heartless
ruffian roared out, striking his hand with tremendous energy upon
the table, &ldquo;Better and better .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why, this
<i>is</i> glorious. We shall have most capital sport here
presently. Bring the wench to, as quick as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paced the apartment for a few moments with hurried strides as
if under the influence of some extraordinary excitement, and
presently broke out again with, &ldquo;McCoy, throw a bucket of
water over that grovelling beast. So! That will revive him! And
now, mistress, let&rsquo;s have our supper directly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>McGuffin was then bound fast to a mill post that stood on one
side of the room. The bushrangers had before this secured Shanavan
and his two sons by placing them back to back, next tying their
arms, legs and bodies together with many cords and lastly girthing
them tight up with a horse&rsquo;s surcingle.</p>

<p>Foxley and the other two now sat down to supper in such a
position that they could keep their eyes upon the prisoners.
Rashleigh was also invited by the former to partake, but he
declined. He in truth felt such a sensation of nausea, which arose
from apprehending that perhaps a scene of worse atrocity might here
be perpetrated than any he had yet witnessed, that it was quite
impossible for him to swallow any food whatever; and he sat
shivering with dread and longing for a means of escape, yet
completely cowed and fascinated by the searching glances which
Foxley directed towards him from time to time.</p>

<p>This ruffian compelled the girl betrothed to McGuffin to serve
him with food upon her knees and to taste everything on the table
prepared for their supper. He also bade her, &ldquo;Remember, as
nobody else but such a superfine scoundrel as McGuffin would do you
for a husband, his life is now in my hands; so you&rsquo;d better
try to keep me in good temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After supper was over the involuntary attendants were obliged to
produce spirits, and Foxley, having ascertained there was very
little flour in the house, directed one of the girls to fill the
hopper of the steel mill with wheat. This being done, McGuffin was
partially unbound and ordered by McCoy to set to work and grind the
grain.</p>

<p>His reply was equally brief and energetic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
you all in hell first!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Foxley heard this, and leaping up, cried, &ldquo;Oho, you
mutiny, do you? I&rsquo;ll see how <i>game</i> you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he ran to a saddle, from which he stripped the
stirrup-leather. Then, pouncing upon McGuffin, he tore the shirt
from his back and this being his only garment, the latter was quite
naked. The bushranger then began to beat him with the buckle end of
his heavy weapon. The prisoner struggled violently; yet, though he
was a very powerful man, he could not loosen the ligatures with
which he was tied; but from the peculiar manner in which they were
secured, his efforts only served to make the rude cords cut into
his flesh.</p>

<p>For all this, the sufferer, whose courage and fortitude appeared
indomitable, instead of deprecating the barbarity of Foxley, only
continued to excite him with the keenest sarcasms, such as,
&ldquo;Strike, scoundrel! You couldn&rsquo;t knock a sprat off a
gridiron. You couldn&rsquo;t brush a fly off your mother&rsquo;s
nose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although through the powerful blows inflicted by his bulky
antagonist his back was sorely mangled and the blood running in a
fair stream down to the ground, yet his courage quailed not, until
Foxley was fairly exhausted and compelled to leave off for lack of
strength.</p>

<p>McGuffin then roared out. &ldquo;Ah, you beast. I knew from your
looks you was nothing but a flogger the first time I set eyes upon
you. And you can&rsquo;t say ever I flogged a man myself in my
life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stung to the very quick by this sarcasm &mdash; for the reproach
attached to the name of a flogger is synonymous with that which
attends the hangman in New South Wales, both offices being there
considered as being upon a par, and a man who has once borne either
being scouted from society as the vilest of the human race &mdash;
Foxley now threw down his implement of torture, and muttering as
well as his loss of breath would permit that he would be deeply
revenged on the other, left him to himself.</p>

<p>His eyes next rested suddenly upon the females, who had been
shrieking in concert at the sight of the cruel punishment; but now,
awed to silence by the brutal threats of McCoy and Smith, they sat
sobbing together. The girls clung round their mother, who appeared
more dead than alive; and when Foxley saw them in this posture, a
thought worthy of a demon rushed into his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he suddenly roared. &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo;
And springing upon McGuffin&rsquo;s betrothed, he tore her from the
maternal embrace, and went on, &ldquo;McCoy, take the other girl
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Smith, push that old bitch into the bedroom. And
mind she don&rsquo;t get out again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of the poor mother&rsquo;s resistance and
heart-breaking entreaties, she was forced from the apartment, when
Rashleigh, whose blood began to curdle within him at the horrid
anticipations he formed respecting Foxley&rsquo;s purpose, jumped
out of his seat and entreated that ruthless villain to be merciful
for once and spare the girls, adjuring him to think of his own
mother, of his sisters, and what he would think of such an outrage
being offered to them. The only reply he received was, at last, as
in his energy, he had laid hold of the fainting girl, hoping to
prevail, a blow from the butt end of Foxley&rsquo;s pistol in the
centre of his forehead stretched him senseless on the floor. And
alas, upon his reviving, he saw enough to convince him that the
worst of crimes had been perpetrated upon the poor girls by all
three of his villainous associates, one of whom shortly afterwards
demanded if Rashleigh were satisfied <i>now</i> to mind his own
business, or whether he would like to have a <i>blue pill</i>
(bullet) to finish the sports of the night.</p>

<p>Ralph, almost mad, and quite sick of this wretched life, clasped
his hands, saying, &ldquo;Go on, shoot me! And end it at once. As
well die that way as by the hangman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; now demanded Foxley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only this jackass is tired of his life,&rdquo; returned
Smith. &ldquo;And I think &rsquo;twere a good deed to finish it for
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, you shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; rejoined the chief.
&ldquo;The crawling beggar shan&rsquo;t get out of our hands half
so easy as that! We&rsquo;ll make him wish himself dead a hundred
times over before we have done with him!&rdquo; And so saying, he
pushed the captive to the door.</p>

<p>It was now dawn, and Foxley, directing Ralph to follow him, went
to a neighbouring open hovel, under which there stood a horse that
the bushranger made his unwilling companion prepare for riding and
lead to the house. When this was done, Foxley called out to McCoy,
directing him to bring out McGuffin, who accordingly made his
appearance with his hands tied fast together. The chief having
mounted the horse, Rashleigh was ordered to take up a huge bundle
of plunder and bring it along. This he steadily refused to do,
nowithstanding the blows and kicks which he received from Smith and
McCoy, who at last bound the load upon his back, and he was himself
then fastened to Foxley&rsquo;s stirrup by his wrists.</p>

<p>While the bushrangers were completing this, McGuffin was left
standing alone, and Rashleigh saw the unfortunate girl who was to
marry him come out of the house with a knife in her hand. As quick
as thought she cut the cord that bound her lover&rsquo;s arms. They
instantly slipped back into the dwelling, the door of which was
directly shut.</p>

<p>This last operation, however, was not so quietly performed but
that it attracted the attention of Foxley, who was before intent on
directing the others how best to secure the recalcitrant Ralph; but
now, turning his head, he missed McGuffin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand devils seize the bloody dog, he&rsquo;s
gone!&rdquo; yelled the astonished robber, gazing round for an
instant, then digging both his heels into the flanks of his
horse.</p>

<p>The animal, which was quite young, leaped forward in great
alarm, dragging Rashleigh to the ground and pulling him on a few
feet; but the horse, growing more restive, plunged, reared, and
finally flung Foxley over his head, while the stirrup-leather
giving way at the same moment, Ralph was freed from the furious
animal, which started off at full speed. Foxley, however, regained
his feet, and gazing around, saw McGuffin, who had gone through the
house without stopping, and who now, in his frantic race, was
nearly at the river&rsquo;s bank. The three bushrangers levelled
their guns, and the charges of all their muskets appeared to plough
the ground on either side of McGuffin, who still ran unharmed.
Foxley and McCoy started after him, Smith being left to watch our
luckless adventurer, whom, tied as he was, the bushranger began to
beat with the butt end of his gun, swearing that he had turned
obstinate on purpose for McGuffin to escape.</p>

<p>In the mean time the latter had reached the stream. At the
moment he plunged into it his two pursuers again discharged their
pieces, which they had reloaded as they ran; but in an incredibly
short space the fugitive reappeared on the opposite bank, which
echoed his loud shout of defiance as he dived into a thicket that
effectually concealed him from further observation.</p>

<p>Foxley and McCoy now returned with sullen looks and slow pace to
the house, where Rashleigh and Smith still remained. They both fell
upon the former and gave him a severe beating, until at last Foxley
remarked, &ldquo;There, blast him! I think he&rsquo;s had enough
now! And we must be off or we shall have all Richmond after
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The burden of spoil was now divided and apportioned among all
the party, who began their retreat, forcing their unhappy prisoner
along with many blows and oft-repeated execrations. In this guise
they got to the riverside once more, and plunged among the tall
reeds on its banks, through which they waded often up to their
middles in mud or water, McCoy urging the adoption of this plan, as
he remarked they should thus leave no trace behind, and besides, if
pursued, no person would think of looking <i>there</i> for
them.</p>

<p>After some hours of most fatiguing toil in this new Slough of
Despond, they arrived at a large tree, which had long previously
fallen into the river; but the water being shallow at this place,
many of its yet undecayed limbs were still above the surface,
though so much overgrown by reeds as not to be at all visible to
any person from the bank, however near. This formed a welcome
resting-place to the weary runaways, and to none more so than to
Rashleigh, who, finding a forked limb in which he could he down
without the danger of falling, stretched his bruised and toil-worn
limbs upon it, and overcome by pain and fatigue, slept for some
time.</p>

<p>His rest was perturbed by fearful dreams. He fancied himself
engaged in mortal struggle with his oppressive tyrant Foxley, whom
he had almost overpowered, when McCoy gripped him by the throat and
presented a pistol close to his head, which at length went off,
inflicting a painful wound, with the anguish of which our exile
awoke to find that it was not all a dream; for Smith&rsquo;s hand
was really grasping his throat, while with demoniac gestures he
pointed to the shore, motioning him at the same time to shift with
silence and caution to a place of more secure concealment.</p>

<p>Rashleigh obeyed this mandate, and his new position on the log
enabled him to see the high ground on the river bank, though it was
next to impossible any person standing there could observe him. He
could scarcely analyze his own feelings as he perceived there were
a number of armed men close at hand, one of whom, mounted on
horseback, he soon recognised to be McGuffin, their late prisoner.
The other two he found were the sons of Shanavan. The former
swearing, as they could most distinctly hear, that he saw a man
down among the reeds only a few moments since, young Shanavan
suggested, &ldquo;If you think there&rsquo;s anybody there,
let&rsquo;s fire down a volley or two; and it&rsquo;s ten to one
but among so many bullets one might tell; or if not, we might make
them sing out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This advice being apparently considered excellent by all the
others, a discharge from full twenty muskets rattled among the
reeds and logs close by the party of bushrangers. Foxley was
apparently struck by one of the balls, for Ralph observed him to
change colour, and he seemed to stagger, as if about to fall from
the cowering attitude he had assumed upon one of the limbs. But an
instant removed the hope Rashleigh was forming that the wretch had
at last got his deserts, for the bushranger sternly compressed his
lips and tightened his grasp of the bough that upheld him.</p>

<p>The experiment having thus failed, the party on shore,
apparently deeming that it was impossible any human beings were
harboured in the suspected spot, moved slowly off, firing from time
to time into the reeds as often as they saw anything to attract
their attention. It was very late at night before the fugitives
dared to leave their place of concealment, and when they did so,
they had several miles to walk before they once more gained the
cavern in which they had made their temporary abode.</p>

<p>There, however, they found other occupants, being no less than
the three young women at whose dwelling they had so recently passed
a night, and who, as it now appeared, had been waiting in this
gloomy place since long ere dawn of the previous day for the return
of the bushrangers from their marauding expedition. These wantons,
at the instance of one of whom the nefarious excursion had at first
been planned, were anxious, it seemed, until their temporary lovers
should return, that they might, according to promise, share in the
spoils of the ill-fated Shanavan, whose purchase of many articles
of unwonted female finery, to grace his eldest daughters&rsquo;
approaching nuptials with McGuffin, had led to the envy of the
girls in question, to whom they had often boasted of their new
acquisitions. And one of their visitors, being an old sweetheart of
the bushranger McCoy, had eagerly embraced the opportunity afforded
by his unexpected visit, to incite himself and Foxley to the
commission of this act of violence, so that they might not only
participate in the plunder, but deprive their rivals, the
Shanavans, of their fine clothing.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the young women saw the plunderers return, and
when each laid down the share of spoil he bore, requesting them to
take what they thought fit, and when, beyond all, the silks,
ribands, laces, etc., of which they had received such glowing
descriptions from the former proprietors, were now unfolded to
their longing eyes, it may be conceived that they most warmly
welcomed the men who had thus risked more than life for the
gratification of their own paltry vanity.</p>

<p>They eagerly requested to hear all about it, and when the party
sat down to a meal which had been prepared by the females during
the absence of their male companions in villainy, a full
description of the whole affair was given by Foxley in the coarsest
terms, not even excepting the disgusting details of the violation
of the poor girls&rsquo; chastity, which only made these fiends in
female shape laugh heartily; and one of them observed that the
Shanavan girls would not hold up their heads so high any more above
any other young women who were fond of sweethearting.</p>

<p>Rashleigh could hardly believe the evidence of his senses. These
girls, so fair and yet so callous, so totally lost to all womanly
pity or shame, appeared to him absolute anomalies, though he had
before heard that the most sinful deeds of shame were of common
occurrence among the children belonging to the lower class of
settlers in that early day. The long-continued evil habits of their
parents, who generally on both sides had served sentences of
transportation, had rendered <i>them</i> quite indifferent to
virtue and inured to vice. Means of instruction there were none,
and the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes, either at work, at
their merrymakings, or bathing in the rivers, which last the heat
of the climate renders indispensable, all these very early
destroyed any innate principles of modesty. Still, there were many
and very honourable exceptions even among the convict parents, some
of whom often thought, and as often expressed their thought, that
&ldquo;If <i>we</i> have been bad all our lives, that is no reason
why <i>our children</i> should be so too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our adventurer had ample leisure, during the progress of this
merry meal in the cavern, to observe the fulsome conduct of the
damsels in question, who each. attached herself to one of the
bushrangers as if it were a matter of course. And after supper was
over, each pair retired together to their rude sleeping-places,
leaving to Rashleigh, who was not now permitted to eat with his
imperious tyrants, the fragments of their meal for his refreshment,
and the choice of any unoccupied portion of the cavern for his
repose.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22" id=
"Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22</b>
</h2>

<p class="note">He took a hundred mortal wounds;<br>
As mute as fox mid mangling hounds.<br>
And when he died, his parting groan<br>
Had more of laughter than of moan!</p>

<p>The loud baying of a dog awoke the desperadoes concealed in the
cavern. It was broad daylight, and they quickly discovered that the
outlet to their retreat was beset. In the intervals of the clamour
made by their canine assailants, they could hear many human voices,
whose expressions denoted their certainty that they had at last
tracked the ruffian Foxley and his bloodthirsty band to their
harbourage, while the tone of one, who seemed to be in authority,
was now distinguishable; who, after stilling the fierce baying of
his four-footed allies, demanded if any man present knew what sort
of a cave it was. Another voice replied to this enquiry, that it
was very large, but had only this one outlet.</p>

<p>Directly afterwards the leader shouted out, &ldquo;Foxley, we
know you are here, and you may as well come out, for we will carry
away the hill by handfuls, but what we will have you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this invitation the person addressed made no reply, but
busily occupied himself in loading all his fire-arms, in which
example he was imitated by his companions, and the whole three now
took up positions on one side commanding the entrance, which, it
will be remembered, was so low that a man must creep upon all fours
to come in.</p>

<p>Again and again the garrison of the cave was hailed, but still
preserved an obstinate silence. At last a figure appeared at the
opening, worming its way in. The head was hardly well in sight when
the reports of three muskets resounded with terrific effect through
the cavern. The cap fell off the intruder, which now proved to be
merely a long pole, dressed up for the nonce to ascertain the
impediments which might offer to freedom of ingress. A loud shout
greeted the success of this stratagem by the assailants, and once
more Foxley was hailed, to tell him if he did not come out and
surrender they would smother him and all his companions with smoke,
as they did the rats on board ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may try that and be damned,&rdquo; growled the
dauntless ruffian m reply.</p>

<p>Nor was it long before dense volumes of smoke filled the hold,
rolling in thick, yellow, suffocating masses into every nook and
cranny, until the inmates had no resource to preserve their lives;
save by lying down flat on their faces and placing mouths and
nostrils to the ground. The women were in great fear, but
restrained themselves from making any noisy demonstrations of it,
and they at length found a spot much more free from this
suffocating vapour than any other part of the cavern. Owing to its
being placed far back, beyond the narrow slit before mentioned as
serving the bushrangers for a chimney, they were much more at
ease.</p>

<p>For two hours the fire was kept up. It was then slackened, and
voices could again be heard outside: they were speculating upon the
probability of any of the marauders being still alive. Presently
the former stratagem was repeated; but this time it produced no
effect, the bushrangers being apparently determined now not to
throw away a charge of ammunition until they should be certain of
their mark, and the pole was in consequence shortly withdrawn. A
volley of musketry was next discharged through the opening; but the
balls rattled idly against the rocky roof of the bushrangers&rsquo;
fortress, as the latter, being all lying on the floor, and the
pieces apparently elevated at their muzzles in firing, all the shot
passed harmlessly over them.</p>

<p>Three of the assailants now came creeping in, one of whom was
rather before the other two. Foxley sprang to his feet, placed
himself beside the entrance without noise, and the instant the
man&rsquo;s head was within his reach, the brass-bound stock of the
ruffian&rsquo;s musket descended upon it with such force that the
skull was shattered as absolutely as if it had been but a walnut
shell, the blood and brains of the victim flying in the faces of
his two compeers, who both uttered cries of pain as McCoy and Smith
discharged their pieces at them. But these two either withdrew from
the opening immediately or were pulled back by their associates
outside, for they disappeared directly, while the dead body of
their comrade still cumbered the entrance.</p>

<p>The bushrangers, having now reloaded their pieces, discharged
all three of them together at random through the orifice after the
fugitives, which served at least to clear their immediate front.
The voices were not so distinctly heard any more; but fire was
renewed, and the smoke reappeared in greater volume than ever.
After some time Foxley went to the split or rift that had as yet
proved their salvation by allowing part of the smoke to escape.
After looking at it for some time, he motioned McCoy to him, and
they both began to fashion some pegs out of the remains of their
firewood, and these they drove into various parts of the side so as
to form a rude kind of ladder on which the leader soon got. These
enabled him to reach a projecting pinnacle that concealed portion
of the orifice above them, and he quickly afterwards threw down a
quantity of rubbish into the cave and got still higher. At last he
was seen or heard no longer for some minutes.</p>

<p>When Foxley made his reappearance he seemed in great joy, and
Ralph heard him, addressing one of the girls, say, &ldquo;Thanks to
old Nick, Sophy, we can all get out of this smothering hole as easy
as kiss your hand. I&rsquo;ve been right up to the top, seen all
them beggars below, busy heaping more wood on to the fire. But they
could not see me, and there&rsquo;s a gully within a hundred yards
of the mouth of the hole. If we could only get there unseen, they
might bid us good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This news being communicated to Smith and McCoy, the flight
began, with Foxley getting up first to help the women, that
followed him closely. McCoy was after them, to render any
assistance that might be required. Rashleigh came next, loaded with
food, and Smith closed the retreat. After the pinnacle or ledge
which served them for a landing-place was once gained, the
difficulty in ascending was really but very slight, the chasm being
wide enough to allow even Ralph, burdened as he was, to squeeze
along it; and the angle of inclination was not by any means too
steep to walk up.</p>

<p>When Rashleigh reached the top, their female companions were
already gone, and the thick shrubs, coupled with the smoke that
rolled over the face of the hill and the natural inequalities of
the place, effectually concealed them from the view of those
beneath, whom they could however hear plainly enough stimulating
each other to increased exertion and venting many a bitter
execration upon the heads of Foxley and his ruffian fellows.</p>

<p>The bushrangers did not long remain to remark the proceedings of
their foes, but took their way to the gully, along which they
rapidly passed, nor paused an instant in their headlong haste,
until they had placed the hill between themselves and their
assailants, whom they soon left far behind them.</p>

<p>They pursued their hurried flight westward with the greatest
speed they could exert, nor did they see a single living thing
during the whole of that day. At nightfall, deep in the recesses of
a darksome and rocky ravine of the mountain, they at length halted
and stretched themselves upon the ground to rest, not daring to
light any fire for the preparation of food even in this solitude,
as fear urged upon them that they might be close pursued, and the
gleam of a light in such a waste would immediately attract the
attention of those whom they most desired to shun.</p>

<p>In the dead of the night Foxley roared out, &ldquo;Help! Murder!
I am choking .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Take his hand from my throat.
Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon his comrades&rsquo; going to his assistance, they found him
in a kind of fit, with his eyes wide open, foaming at the mouth,
raving incoherent muttering sounds and gnashing his teeth. They
obtained some water, by the application of which he partially
revived; but he was no sooner able to stand than he got up and ran
off at full speed. McCoy directed Smith to look out after our
adventurer, and follow them. He then hastened on the tracks of the
other, whom they all thought had gone mad.</p>

<p>Smith now, by blows and curses, compelled Rashleigh to get up
and renew the flight, stumbling in the darkness over fallen trees,
at times falling into cavities worn by mountain streams, yet not
allowed to stay for a single instant by his brutal companions, to
whom fear lent wings, because they believed the avengers of blood
to be at their heels. Our unhappy adventurer was hurried along for
four and twenty hours more through the heart of the mountains; and
when, at last, they deemed themselves in a slight degree of safety,
they halted on the edge of the valleys of the Comnaroy, at least
140 miles distant from the scene of their last outrage.</p>

<p>As if to add to the discomfort of these guilty wretches, the
weather, which had been variable for some time, now settled into a
perfect deluge of wet. The loudest peals of heaven-born artillery
reverberated through the sky. The forked lightnings played around
them upon every side in broad and vivid sheets of flame. The
loftiest trees were crashed to the earth, and the rain descended in
such torrents that every small level spot was converted into a
standing pool.</p>

<p>The houseless wretches, who did not even possess the means of
stripping a sheet of bark, the ordinary resource of bushmen in
Australia upon such occasions, were now perfectly miserable.
Overpowered with the fatigue of their superhuman exertions in the
hurried flight, they yet could only rest in a miry pool or snatch
brief and dangerous repose by leaning against trees, liable every
instant they did so to be hurried into eternity by an explosion of
the electric fluid. Firing, of course, was beyond their reach, for
had they even succeeded in lighting a scanty flame, it could endure
but few moments beneath such torrents of rain as continually were
falling. Their scanty clothing was quickly drenched and all their
food spoilt, but these they felt to be minor evils compared to the
want of repose, which they one and all so much needed. The vilest
hovel which could afford them shelter would have been hailed with
heartfelt joy as superior to that experienced in the possession of
a palace.</p>

<p>There has been an idea prevalent in almost all bygone ages and
nearly every country under heaven, that men whose crimes have been
so atrocious that they actually seemed to cry aloud to heaven for
vengeance, have at length been utterly cast off as unworthy the
divine mercy, and that they appear even in this world to feel a
foretaste of those torments to which they are doomed, the anguish
of which deprives them of reason and renders their ruin more easy
and certain.</p>

<p>The Scottish language has at this day a word expressive of the
national belief in such a doctrine. It is <i>fey</i>, and is used
to designate the conduct of a man who rushes, as it were, upon
destruction; and the old Romans used to say, <i>quem deus vult
perdere, prius dementat</i>.</p>

<p>To this notion Ralph Rashleigh ever inclined in his after life
from having witnessed the conduct of the villain Foxley during
those dreadful three days they spent in the Comnaroy swamps. This
ruffian, who had by his own account been repeatedly guilty of every
crime that stains the decalogue and of others so atrocious that
they are not named among Christians, in short, whose soul was so
despoiled with blood-stained guilt that it might have dyed the
waters of the vast ocean, was here delivered up a prey to the
sharpest pangs of remorse. Twenty times in a day would he now
exemplify the truth of the sacred word which states that &ldquo;the
wicked flee when no man pursueth&rdquo;. Often he would seem to
have his staring eye-balls fixed on vacancy, until a strong, fierce
shuddering came over his whole frame, and he fell to the earth,
raving ever that he was being choked, or that dogs were tearing him
piecemeal. Then, after the humble means his colleagues in crime
possessed had been effectually used for his resuscitation, he would
start to his feet and run with frantic speed until his strength was
exhausted or his failing limbs struck against some obstacles that
hurled him headlong to the ground.</p>

<p>During all this time he spoke not one reasonable word, and if
either Smith or McCoy went near him would fix his unspeakably wild
eyes upon their faces as if he knew them not. But when they began
to speak kindly to him, he would glare wildly for a few seconds and
at last would get up and run, or endeavour to strike them to the
earth. On the evening of the third day Ralph overheard a
conversation between McCoy and Smith, from the terms of which it
seemed they were at last agreed that their leader had become
hopelessly mad, and they now deliberated whether they had better
kill him. Smith suggested for them to toss up who should do this,
and then, cutting off Foxley&rsquo;s head, go in and deliver it,
telling a plausible tale of the hardships he had perforce to
sustain to capture the ruffian, by which means as this both, or at
any rate one of the two, might at least earn pardon for himself,
with the hope of a reward of freedom or promotion besides.</p>

<p>McCoy did not appear much to relish this plan; but Smith urged
so many cogent arguments in its favour that at last it was mutually
agreed to think over the scheme until morning, and the ruffians
withdrew to the scanty covert of boughs which they had put up to
shelter them in some measure from the pelting of the pitiless
storm, which still continued unabated, and indeed appeared likely
to last for many days yet.</p>

<p>Rashleigh had contrived a kind of lair for himself by breaking
up a number of boughs, which he laid on the earth, the larger
sticks downwards, confining them in their places by stakes set
upright on each side, This he roofed with other bare boughs first,
and at length thatched with small leafy twigs tied up in bundles.
This very meagre shelter, however, he did not complete until the
evening of the third day, for it was very troublesome, as he had
only a small knife for a stock of working tools. Yet when
completed, the loose sticks beneath permitted a passage for the
water under his body, while the leafy thatch &mdash; the leaves
being carefully placed all one way &mdash; kept him a little dry
overhead. He proceeded to take an immeasurable quantity of repose,
which was so very needful, especially after the long fatigue and
continual drenching he had received.</p>

<p>It was late on the morning of the fourth day when a great
commotion induced our adventurer to peep out of his bothy. He saw
Foxley down, bleeding profusely, and doubted not that his two
compeers had indeed made up their minds to sacrifice him as they
had spoken of doing the previous night; but he quickly found out it
was an accident, induced by the chief&rsquo;s having started madly
up, as before, and fallen over a root. His head had come in contact
with a sharp-pointed stone, cutting a deep gash above his temple,
which his companions were now vainly endeavouring to close so as to
stanch the bleeding, which indeed was profuse; nor was it until
Foxley must have lost nearly two quarts of blood that their rude
bandage produced its wished-for effect.</p>

<p>The wounded bushranger lay nearly three hours in a torpid state;
and when he at length unclosed his eyes, it was evident that reason
had returned, for he spoke in a soft and very low voice, asking
McCoy, whom he addressed by name, where they were; and he seemed
much surprised when he was told the distance they had travelled.
After taking a drink of water, Foxley went once more to sleep, and
as the rain had now gone completely away, the others were enabled
to do so likewise, on some drier part, more agreeably than they had
yet done since they left Richmond. The next day, being the fifth of
their sojourn here, during which time they had had but one meal,
Foxley was very hungry; and as his fellow-marauders felt the
assaults of the same enemy, they determined to set about robbing
some settlement in order to obtain provisions. They therefore
followed the banks of the Comnaroy rivulet, not doubting but that
they would discover some stock &mdash; or sheep-station, of which
there were a good many to the right of the Bathurst country.</p>

<p>They now turned southwards along the edge of the brook; but it
was not until the forenoon of the next day that they at last
descried a small hut and stockyard, which occupied the centre of a
little natural clearing. The door of the dwelling was open, and
smoke was ascending the chimney.</p>

<p>The bushrangers deliberated together how they might best
approach it without being perceived by the inmates, until they
should be too close for any of them to escape. At length they all
made a circuit, by which they gained the back of the place, still
keeping among the trees. Here Foxley and Smith disencumbered
themselves of all their burdens, taking only a gun in the hand, and
pistols in the belt of each; and throwing themselves on their
faces, began to crawl through the grass in that manner. Rashleigh
who was left in the charge of McCoy, was lying down behind a log,
but could see the space around the hut without any difficulty. He
observed that just as the two desperadoes had reached one corner of
the stockyard, a man came out of the dwelling with a whip in his
hand, and now approached a small shed built against the end of it,
from which he led forth a horse ready saddled and bridled. He had
his foot in the stirrup and was apparently about to mount when the
two bushrangers stood up and presenting their pieces at him,
ordered him to halt on peril of death. But the man, just casting
one glance at them, vaulted lightly into the saddle and struck his
horse with the spur, so that the animal bounded off.</p>

<p>After the rider had passed the covert of the hut, he rode within
twenty yards of Foxley and Smith, who again roared out to him to
stop; but he shook his bridle rein, and on sped the active colt he
bestrode. Both the bushrangers fired simultaneously. The
rider&rsquo;s hat flew off, pierced by the slugs from Smith&rsquo;s
musket. That the horseman was yet unharmed a loud cheer soon
satisfied all within hearing of it, and he was quickly lost to view
among the trees, riding south at the top of his speed. His
opponents now reloaded their pieces, and calling upon McCoy to join
them, disappeared into the hovel.</p>

<p>When Rashleigh and his guard arrived at the door they found the
three inmates of the hut upon their knees, while Foxley, with a
pistol in each hand, was raving at them and threatening them all
with instant death. As soon as Smith saw McCoy about to enter, he
made a significant motion, as if indicating his disgust at the
present proceedings of their leader, and added a gesture, as if he
only sought the assent of his comrade to fire his piece into
Foxley&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>But McCoy shook his head in disapprobation of this proposal, and
instead of it said to his leader, &ldquo;I say, Phil, don&rsquo;t
be in a passion, but let us make these crawlers get us a feed
ready, for I&rsquo;m very hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Sandy?&rdquo; demanded the insane ruffian.
&ldquo;I thought these beggars had got you taken, and I was just
a-going to slaughter them for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
taken yet! Come, get up, you chaps, and let us see what you have
got to eat.&rdquo; And the trembling inmates, thus released from
the fear of immediate death, began to bustle about in order to make
ready food for these unwelcome visitors.</p>

<p>One of these stockmen was very tall and had a singularly
forbidding, lugubrious expression of countenance, upon which Foxley
fixed his eyes repeatedly, sometimes with a vacant look of
interrogation, and at others with an angry frown. At last his
diseased imagination prompted the bushranger, and he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, you great long fellow, what&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man tremblingly replied, &ldquo;Allen. William Allen is my
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lie, blast you!&rdquo; roared the querist; &ldquo;for
you are long Hempenstall, that used to hang the rebels long ago in
Ireland!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure, sir,&rdquo; returned the terrified object of
this address, &ldquo;I never was in Ireland in my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I say, Sandy,&rdquo; persisted Foxley,
&ldquo;An&rsquo;t it a hard case that such a varmint of a
caterpillar as that should strive to make a man like me out a liar?
I tell you&rdquo;&mdash; to the stockrnan &mdash;&ldquo;you are the
walking gallows! I have heard my father talk about you when I was
little, how you used to go about with ropes, and when the soldiers
would catch a couple of rebels, they would tie them together by the
neck and throw them over your shoulder so that they was
choked!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor man here muttered it was not possible it could be him,
as he was only twenty-two years of age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; roared the brutal Foxley, cruel even in
insanity. &ldquo;Say so again, and I&rsquo;ll tear your tongue out
by the roots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the long ghost, Phil,&rdquo; now interposed
McCoy. &ldquo;The feed is ready. Come along!&rdquo; And he
persuaded the ruffian to go to the table.</p>

<p>Before Foxley would begin to eat, however, he pulled a pistol
out of his belt and laid it beside him. And after their meal he
roared out for the object of his suspicious hatred, whom he
persisted in calling Hempenstall, and caused him to sing for his
sport; then, taking down a stockwhip, he flogged him for making
ugly faces.</p>

<p>The next vagary he engaged in was making all the three inmates
of the hut dance jigs, he himself repeatedly quickening their steps
by lashing them upon the legs. And these and other diversions he
prolonged until after sunset, in spite of the entreaties of Smith
and McCoy, who wished to be gone from the place, fearing the
approach of some assailants, whom the horseman that had escaped
would most probably dispatch to apprehend them.</p>

<p>To all the desires and urgent requests of Smith and McCoy that
he would leave this hut, Foxley only at first replied by an idiotic
laugh; but when towards nightfall they became more pressing in
their instances, he worked himself into a fury, bidding them begone
by themselves. Nor was it until after dark that he would set off,
and even then insisted on passing the night in a thicket scarcely a
mile from the scene of their last robbery.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the bushrangers were about to proceed,
but had scarcely begun their march before they found there was a
camp of native blacks close at hand, who had obviously seen them
first and were now preparing for the attack. An obstinate conflict
ensued before the sable sons of the forest were sufficiently
dispersed to enable the marauders to pursue their flight; and when
at last they gave way in front, they hung upon the skirts and rear
of the route taken by the bushrangers, frequently discharging a
spear or boomerang at one or other of the white men.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the blacks seemed to relax in their pursuit,
and when at length the fugitives imagined themselves in a place of
sufficient security to warrant their halting, not one of their
assailants had been heard or seen for upward of two hours. The
harassing nature of their day&rsquo;s march, carried on in
continual dread, without food since the previous evening, made rest
with a prospect of refreshment very welcome to all, and each one
set himself busily to work to assist in the preparation of their
supper.</p>

<p>They were all engaged in partaking of this meal when suddenly a
wild cry of a most thrilling and savage kind burst from a
neighbouring thicket and a perfect shower of spears and other
native missiles rained among them, some of which knocked both McCoy
and Rashleigh over as they sat, without however very materially
injuring either. Smith and Foxley leaped on their feet and fired
into the thicket. A yell of anguish followed the discharge, which
was redoubled when the latter &mdash; whose whole conduct seemed to
have undergone a complete change, his reason appearing to return at
the approach of danger &mdash; now, with a smile of malignant
satsfaction, seized a fire stick, and calling on his companions to
follow him, set fire to the scrubby thicket that concealed their
enemies.</p>

<p>Smith and McCoy instantly copied his example, running hither and
thither with their blazing brands, until the whole of the seared
undergrowth was in a flame. The breeze, blowing freshly from the
west, seconded their efforts, and the destructive element, flying
on the wings of the wind, soon outstripped the efforts of the
unfortunate aborigines to escape. Many frantic yells testified
their agony at the torments by which they were thus suddenly
encircled, and their unconquerable enemy, the fire, seemed like the
hydra, on every hand expanding its devouring jaws to receive them;
while the noise of the advancing flames, as they reared their fiery
heads on high, until with blazing tongues they licked the tops of
the loftiest forest trees, was a perfectly appalling compound of
roaring, crackling and hissing, while ever and anon the explosion
of some small receptacle of pent-up air appeared like a discharge
of musketry.</p>

<p>A few of the boldest of the blacks charged the bushrangers
through the flames, and two or three of them were shot down in the
attempt, the rest scouring away in the direction of their camp, but
so fearfully scorched that it seemed highly problematical whether
any of them could survive. The fire, now having exhausted all it
could feed upon in this neighbourhood, was posting on toward the
east, spreading its destructive ravages on every side and
illuminating the sky for many a mile with a lurid glow.</p>

<p>Foxley, after laughing at the retreating foes in a scornful
manner, said, &ldquo;They say a burned child dreads the fire. if
so, I should think we might now get our suppers without any fear of
them black beggars coming back to disturb us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; remarked McCoy.
&ldquo;Maybe they might come after us the more now to try for
revenge. I&rsquo;ve heard say the blacks in this part will follow
any man that does them an injury an hundred miles, but what they
will sarve him out for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, maybe so,&rdquo; rejoined Foxley. &ldquo;All
we&rsquo;ve got to do is to keep a sharp look-out, for I
don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be like to sneak upon us through
the scrub any more after the warming they got!&rdquo; And the party
once more sat down to their food, which they finished in peace; nor
were they again molested during that night.</p>

<p>Having resumed their march next day, they were much surprised
about ten o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon to hear the baying of
several dogs, a circumstance which the more alarmed them in this
solitude, as they had good reasons for believing they were not
nearer than thirty miles to any habitation of civilized man. They
halted and began to ponder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Smith at last. &ldquo;The
wind is blowing from the south. Bathurst lies in that direction
from here. Those dogs are coming this way, and it&rsquo;s very
likely they are the bloodhounds in search of us; for they have
bloodhounds there. 1 have been hunting the blacks with them
myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound grew nearer every instant, and facing to the quarter
from whence it proceeded, they quickly saw several mounted and
apparently well-armed men, who appeared to be galloping on their
track, guided as well by the dogs they had heard as by several
blackfellows, some of whom bore evident marks in their singed heads
and scorched appearances of being those who escaped from the
burning scrub the night before. Now, prompted by revenge and
probably also stimulated by promises of reward from those they led,
they were using their keenest sagacity in following the trail of
Foxley and his comrades, whose destruction these sable warriors
absolutely panted for, after the immolation of so many of their
tribe by the hands of the marauders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is those infernal bloodhounds!&rdquo; cried Foxley to
his companions. &ldquo;And by all the devils in hell!&rdquo; he
added, as the pursuers drew nearer, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that
blasted McGuffin at the head of the party, and the young Shanavans
alongside of him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&rsquo;t know what you mean
to do,&rdquo; added the ruffian, now rendered desperate, &ldquo;but
I will never be taken alive; nor I&rsquo;ll not fall by myself
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McCoy and Smith both swore they would die on the ground they
occupied, and consequently. the bushrangers, shaking hands all
round, prepared themselves for a desperate struggle.</p>

<p>As for Rashleigh, he was now quite neglected, and crept into a
thicket out of the way. Here he lay <i>perdu</i> behind a log, but
could see all that passed, himself, as he hoped, unobserved.</p>

<p>The spot occupied by the bushrangers was on the rise of a
considerable elevation; between them and the advancing party lay a
narrow valley, and the intermediate space was nearly clear of
trees.</p>

<p>McGuffin had now espied his late tormentors, and he shouted out
to his followers, &ldquo;Here are the murdering, ravishing dogs at
last. Hurra! Down with them, my lads!&rdquo; And he fired his piece
at the head of Foxley as he spoke, but without effect, for the
bushrangers, one and all, were covered by trees, round which they
dodged, so as to prevent a certain aim being taken at them.</p>

<p>The young Shanavans also united their boyish voices in a
cheering hurra, which was echoed by two mounted policemen that rode
beside them. This party also fired as they advanced; and the
latter, flinging their carbines to the earth, drew their sabres and
galloped up the hill towards the bushrangers, who were now also
attacked in their rear by the party of blacks with volleys of
spears and every other native missile weapon.</p>

<p>The marauders&rsquo; retreat was thus effectually cut off; but
to do the ruffian Foxley justice, he does not seem to have thought
of any such thing as flight. For he stood unflinchingly and
returned the cheer of the attacking party with one equally loud,
shouting out to his comrades &ldquo;not to fire till the beggars
were close up&rdquo;, an order which he himself followed so exactly
that McGuffin was nearly riding over him before the bushranger
chief pulled the trigger of his piece, and down came his assailant,
horse and man, to the ground.</p>

<p>McGuffin, however, was unwounded, for by checking his steed
suddenly when he saw Foxley&rsquo;s intention, the animal had
reared up and received the discharge in his brain that was intended
for his rider, who had gained his knee in rising again; while
Foxley, with his musket clubbed, was rushing upon him to beat out
his brains, when the youngest of the Shanavans struck the
bushranger&rsquo;s weapon out of his hand, and himself to the earth
with the butt end of his gun.</p>

<p>McGuffin seized Foxley as he fell, and a desperate struggle
ensued, neither party being enabled to rise or to obtain any
advantage over the other, while young Shanavan could not strike the
bushranger again for fear of injuring his companion as they rolled
over and over the ground. At length one of the policemen, coming
up, seized an opportunity, and cleft Foxley&rsquo;s skull
completely in twain with his weighty sabre, and the bloodthirsty
ruffian thus died without a groan. Yet such was the tenacity of his
grip upon McGuffin&rsquo;s throat that it was found necessary to
cut off his right hand at the wrist and to mangle every one of his
fingers before the other could be freed.</p>

<p>In the mean time Smith had shot one of the advancing policemen
dead, but was in his turn sabred by the same policeman that had
given Foxley his death blow; while McCoy, by whose hand the elder
Shanavan had fallen badly wounded, was knocked down by the younger
one, to whom he was at last forced to yield, being overpowered,
disarmed and secured by two or three others before he could get
up.</p>

<p>McGuffin was some time before he recovered the effects of
Foxley&rsquo;s death grip, and when he regained his legs, he
apostrophized his now inanimate enemy. &ldquo;You wretch,
I&rsquo;ve paid my vow at last. I&rsquo;ve never yet been off a
horse since you <i>done</i> it; and I would have hunted you to hell
but I&rsquo;d have got my revenge.&rdquo; And with that he kicked
the prostrate ruffian.</p>

<p>At this moment he saw McCoy in the hands of captors, and raising
from the earth the piece which Foxley had dropped, he rushed
towards the captive bushranger. Those who held McCoy left go their
holds, and the latter, suddenly drawing a pistol from his breast
which had escaped their search, levelled it at McGuffin, and ere
the other could close with him, fired. His opponent fell instantly;
but the surviving policeman, rushing up, cut McCoy down the moment
afterwards.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the blacks, in hunting about, had discovered
our unfortunate adventurer&rsquo;s retreat, and dragged him forth
to the light. The other men were now all busily engaged about
McGuffin, whose wound, on being examined, was found not likely to
be immediately mortal, and Rashleigh was led unresistingly by his
sable captors to this spot, where he was quickly recognised by a
person present as having formed one of the party when they robbed
the hut on the Comnaroy rivulet; and in spite of his protestations
that he had been the unwilling thrall of the bushrangers, he was
secured in handcuffs.</p>

<p>After a consultation, the victors placed the bodies of Foxley
and Smith, who were quite dead, upon one horse; and those of the
policeman and a constable, who had also been slain in the fray,
were bound on another. McCoy and McGuffin, both severely wounded,
were mounted on horseback before two of the party, their wounds
having been first as well bandaged as circumstances would permit.
Young Shanavan attended to his elder brother, whose wound was not
found to be so very severe, and the party thus began their march to
Bathurst, which, journeying slowly, they reached upon the third
day, when Rashleigh was placed in separate confinement from
McCoy.</p>

<p>The inhabitants for many miles round flocked to hear the
evidence given upon the inquest, which took place three days after
their arrival. The dead bodies were placed in an outer shed,
McGuffin was brought on a stretcher from the hospital, and McCoy,
tied on an easy chair, was placed at the bar with our
adventurer.</p>

<p>After hearing the evidence of McGuffin and the others, a verdict
of &ldquo;justifiable homicide&rdquo; was returned in the case of
Foxley and Smith, while on view of the bodies of the policeman and
constable, it was found that &ldquo;wilful murder&rdquo; had been
committed by Philip Foxley, Christopher Smith and Andrew McCoy, the
two former of whom were since deceased; and the latter was held
over to take his trial at the next sessions of the Supreme Criminal
Court at Sydney.</p>

<p>Our adventurer, who had not been seen by any of the witnesses
during the affray, and who had been found unarmed after it was
over, was next examined before a magistrate, and his examination
ended in his committal to take his trial at the same time and place
with Andrew McCoy, for bushranging and robbery, both of which at
that time were equally capital offences with the most cold-blooded
brutal murder.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23" id=

<p align="center" class="note">There are more things in heaven and
earth, Horatio,<br>
Than are dreamed of in your philosophy.</p>

<p>It was many weeks before McCoy was judged sufficiently out of
danger to travel, in the tender estimation of the medical
gentlemen, who were most assiduous in their attention to him, so
that he might be sufficiently recovered to grace the gallows with
proper &eacute;clat. At length they set forward in a bullock-cart,
well guarded by a posse of mounted police. Both Rashleigh and the
other were heavily ironed, and at their departure, so far from
attracting any execrations from the crowd that had assembled to see
them set out, most of the bystanders seemed to pity them very much;
and what our adventurer thought more strange than all, the women in
particular gave vent to many tears of commiseration, especially
devoted to McCoy, whose yet languid motions and pallid features
showed the severity of the sufferings occasioned by his wound; and
many were the gifts of money, tobacco, spirits and provisions that
were made to the prisoners before they left Bathurst.</p>

<p>They were ten days in journeying about a hundred miles, resting
at lock-up houses, the quarters of road gangs, or the various
military stations on the mountains, frequently passing large
parties of their fellow-convicts, either with or without irons on
their legs, who were employed in the formation of those stupendous
roads which traverse that once impassable district. As often as any
of these men expressed their sympathy with the prisoners, whose
death by the hangman all looked upon as certain, McCoy would reply
in accents of triumph,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had a merry life, if &rsquo;twas only a
short one; and I&rsquo;d go and be hanged a hundred times over
rather than drudge like slaves as you chaps are doing now.&rdquo;
And he would sometimes add, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you all turn out
like men, and then the blasted tyrants would soon be put an end
to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The corporal in charge of the escort was asked by an overseer on
the road why he did not stop this kind of talk, as it was obviously
inciting the minds of those who heard it to mutiny, to which query
he replied, laughing, &ldquo;Why, how can I hinder the poor devil
from talking? He&rsquo;s got but a very little while longer to
live, and it would be a pity not to let him spout away as he likes.
Besides,&rdquo; and here the speaker assumed a most comically
knowing look, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know, friend, that the more
runaways there are, the more <i>rewards</i> there will be for
taking them; and if there were no bushrangers, what would be the
use of the mounted police?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This settled the matter apparently to the satisfaction of the
other, who, no doubt, like many of his brother convict overseers,
had not the least objection to earn a pound now and then by taking
any such men as he could first persuade to run away; and a large
sum of money was then annually paid in reward, for apprehending men
who had absconded, to such personages as the speaker, who
afterwards gave a small portion of the bonus to those whom they had
taken.</p>

<p>Journeying in this manner, they at length reached the lock-up at
Penrith, where Ralph was quickly recognised as having not long
before belonged to Emu Plains. Among a crowd that had assembled to
look at the remains of &ldquo;Foxley&rsquo;s gang&rdquo; our
adventurer soon observed those three girls that had acted so
prominent a part with the bushrangers at Richmond. They were now
very much <i>over</i>-dressed in the spoils acquired at the robbery
of Shanavan&rsquo;s place, which had led to the unremitting pursuit
that resulted in the capture of their former acquaintances.</p>

<p>These frail fair ones pressed to the side of the vehicle and
seemed to vie with each other in expressions of tenderness towards
McCoy, as well as lamentations over his present position and the
unhappy fate of his companions.</p>

<p>The constables at length removed the prisoners, and Rashleigh
and his associate in misfortune were now for the first time since
their capture locked up together by themselves.</p>

<p>McCoy began a conversation by asking Ralph, &ldquo;Well, what do
you think of it now? Would it not have been as well for you to have
joined Phil Foxley and the rest of us at first, seeing that you led
the <i>life</i> of a dog all the while you was with us, and now, in
spite of all you can say, you are sure to die the <i>death</i> of
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this cheering as well as <i>sensible</i> speech, our
adventurer only replied, &ldquo;As for death, it must come sooner
or later, and though I have no great fancy for the gallows, I have
quite as much liking for <i>that</i> as I have for such a wretched
life of cruelty and crime, attended by frequent starvation and
toil, as was led by the scoundrel Foxley and those that were with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dared not call him a scoundrel while he lived,&rdquo;
replied McCoy, &ldquo;and you are an unmanly rascal to do so
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark ye, McCoy,&rdquo; said Ralph, who began to grow
enraged, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you to know that if Foxley had been
alone with me, unarmed as I was, or if I had been able once to have
laid hold of a loaded musket while I was with him, he would have
found out what Ralph Rashleigh dared to do. And as for <i>you</i>,
were it not for your weakness, I would just this instant beat your
brains out against that wall to repay you for your treatment me
when I was helpless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McCoy jumped up, and throwing off his jacket, cried, &ldquo;Come
on, you crawling beggar, I&rsquo;ll soon let you see how weak I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hundred recollections of this man&rsquo;s ill usage during his
career of crime, when he had his ruffian associates to assist him,
crowded upon the mind of our adventurer, and maddened by fury at
these thoughts, Ralph rushed upon him.</p>

<p>Rashleigh knew nothing of what is called the science of
pugilism, in which McCoy was very expert. Thus, in spite of his
superior strength, our exile was likely to get the worst of it,
until exerting himself suddenly, he beat down his
antagonist&rsquo;s guard, and seizing his head by the ears, bore
him back into a corner, where he pounded the unlucky McCoy&rsquo;s
skull against the wall until the other roared for mercy, and the
turnkey came in, who wanted to know what the matter was. But as
McCoy did not tell him, Rashleigh would not. The official then
enquired which of the two was called McCoy, and this question being
replied to, the janitor asked what the other would stand provided
he were to allow one of the <i>titters</i> (girls) that was outside
to pass the night with him.</p>

<p>To this McCoy replied that he would give a pound. The turnkey
grinned acquiescence and withdrew. But when it became quite dark
the door again opened, and the young woman who has before been
spoken of as McCoy&rsquo;s sweetheart made her
<i>entr&eacute;e</i>, bringing a basket with her, while the
<i>screwsman</i>, who followed her with a quantity of bedding,
said, as he placed the latter on the floor, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
your <i>sister</i>, young fellow; and here&rsquo;s all the bedstuff
I can muster for the three of you, so you must do the best you
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then retired, carefully securing the massy fastenings of
several doors as he went out.</p>

<p>McCoy and his &ldquo;ladye love&rdquo; after many endearments,
began to converse in a low tone; and in a short time, a candle
being lighted, a quantity of provisions and two bottles of spirits
were produced from the basket, which the young woman invited
Rashleigh to share.</p>

<p>He declined to do so very abruptly, but she said, &ldquo;Why, I
hope you an&rsquo;t any ways offended with me. And if you and Sandy
have had a few words or a blow or two, that&rsquo;s nothing
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Surely you can make it up again, especially as you
have not got long to be together, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McCoy then observed, &ldquo;You may as well not quarrel with the
victuals, but come and get some, for maybe you won&rsquo;t get
another chance soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh at length consented to share the meal, in the course
of which the girl remarked that it just put her in mind of her
<i>last</i> sweetheart&rsquo;s last night on earth, for he was then
confined in Windsor lock-up and was shot dead in an attempt to
escape from it early next morning. This young woman proved herself
to be perfectly <i>au fait</i> and well inured to scenes like the
present, nor did she appear to be at all cast down at the thoughts
of the fate that was in store for McCoy, whom she only exhorted to
&ldquo;die like a trump, and <i>split</i> (tell)
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, it seemed great part of her present errand to ascertain
whether there was any probability of either McCoy or Rashleigh
betraying herself and family for harbouring the marauders while
they were in the bush or for receiving the property they had stolen
from Shanavan&rsquo;s, part of which she now wore. After she had
apparently satisfied herself that no danger was to be apprehended
from McCoy, she led the conversation to the nature of the charge
against our adventurer, and said to her lover that if he thought
fit, he could get the young man out of it, as it was pretty
generally understood he had never taken a very active part in
committing depredations.</p>

<p>To this McCoy replied, with an oath, that &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be
<i>blowed</i> if he would though, or any crawler like him
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, no, Soph,&rdquo; continued the desperado.
&ldquo;Let the beggar <i>die</i> as well as me, and then he
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> tell any tales!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this the girl dropped her endeavours, and after having
drunk the spirits among them, all three lay down to rest.</p>

<p>The next morning &ldquo;Soph&rdquo; took a tender leave of her
paramour, promising to follow them to Sydney in a day or two; and
then, turning to Rashleigh, she observed, &ldquo;I hope you
won&rsquo;t bring anybody else into trouble, young fellow, for that
won&rsquo;t do you any good; but if you must die, do so like a
man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph assured her that whatever might be his fate, he would
never turn informer. They then parted; nor did the latter ever see
this fair specimen of frailty more.</p>

<p>In the space of two days from this our criminals reached the old
gaol of Sydney, a building of which it has often been remarked that
if the sentries and fetters did not keep the prisoners from
breaking out, the strength of the edifice never would. The inmates
of this pandemonium may be far better conceived than described,
especially when it is reflected that as New South Wales was the
proper receptacle for the offscourings of villainy from three
mighty kingdoms and all their vast dependencies, so this
<i>choice</i> den was the great cesspit for the moral filth of the
convict colony; and, of course, all undreamed-of and scarcely
imaginable wickedness flourished within these walls in its fullest
and rankest luxuriance of growth.</p>

<p>The authorities invested with the command of the gaol, confining
their whole ideas of prison discipline to the mere safe custody of
the offenders committed to their charge, did not greatly trouble
themselves what enormities they were guilty of among themselves;
and of this Rashleigh and his companion soon received ample proof,
for no sooner had they arrived within the doors of the room to
which they were ushered than every article of clothing was torn
from their backs by the mere force of numbers. and they were left
completely naked save for the rags they had tied round their legs
to keep their fetters from chafing them, and in which Ralph had
taken care to conceal his small stock of cash.</p>

<p>Their plunderers however restored them a few articles of their
clothing after they had been minutely searched for money, and the
new-comers were then declared free of H. M. Gaol at Sydney, which
was understood to mean that they were thenceforward at liberty to
do unto others even as they had been done unto.</p>

<p>The apartment in which they were confined was about forty feet
long and twenty feet wide. In this were huddled generally, during
the period of our adventurer&rsquo;s confinement, not less than 120
human beings of all ages, from the hoary scoundrel of sixty to the
not less villainous scamp of sixteen, and here Rashleigh was
plunged into deeper despair than ever at the contemplation of his
future lot, which, even if life itself were spared, appeared to be
the doom of passing all the remaining portion of it in the society
of ruffians like these he now saw. In thoughts of this kind days
lengthened into weeks, and the hour of trial was rapidly
approaching.</p>

<p>Ralph Rashleigh was moodily contemplating the probable issue of
this, his second appearance at the bar as a capitally criminal
offender, when one morning, as he walked for the short allotted
space in the prison yard, a turnkey halloed his name most lustily,
and he went to the hall door. Here he saw McGuffin, their captor,
accompanied by a female whose face he thought he knew, which was
shortly afterwards assured to him by the former observing,
&ldquo;This is my wife, young man, Miss Shanavan that was.&rdquo;
And the young woman rejoined, &ldquo;Yes, and I am come to see you,
for I have not forgotten the cruel knock on the head you got from
that wretch that&rsquo;s dead for trying to save me and my poor
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here she burst into tears, but McGuffin added, &ldquo;We have
brought you a few things to comfort you, for though I did not see
you get the blow my wife speaks of, yet I can believe her, because
I know I should not have got away from that blasted gang of
scoundrels if you had not turned obstinate on Foxley&rsquo;s hands;
so if I can do you any good on your trial, I will do it with
pleasure.&rdquo; They then went away, and Rashleigh felt much
relieved by their visit, because he conceived the proffered
evidence of McGuffin might be very serviceable to his case.</p>

<p>The eventful day at length arrived. McCoy was first placed upon
his trial. He persisted in pleading guilty, for he said, or rather
shouted, from the dock, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of being
humbugged by such a set of blasted old wretches as that judge and
jury? They are determined to hang me, 1 know; and I don&rsquo;t
care a curse for it! The only thing I am sorry for now is that I
was so merciful when I was out; for if 1 had killed a score or two
more they could only have <i>topped</i> me at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he was stopped with some difficulty, and the learned judge
commenced passing the sentence of death upon him, during which,
however, he was repeatedly interrupted by the prisoner in the
coarsest language; and the latter, when all was over, commenced
pouring forth a torrent of ribaldry, obscenity and abuse on all and
sundry, it finally requiring the united efforts of four strong
constables to drag him from the bar by main force.</p>

<p>Rashleigh&rsquo;s case came next. He was charged with being
present, aiding and abetting in the commission of a robbery
attended with violence, he being at the time a runaway convict. The
evidence of one of the men belonging to the hut on the Comnaroy was
now taken, and was supported by that of McGuffin as to his
apprehension. The prisoner being called on for his defence, he
related the manner in which he had at first been taken by the
bushrangers, and called upon McGuffin to prove what he had seen, in
testimony of his being only their unwilling agent. The latter
stated what had taken place at Shanavan&rsquo;s, coupled with the
fact of Ralph&rsquo;s not bearing arms at the time of the affray
that led to their capture.</p>

<p>The learned judge summed up, leaving it to the jury to say
whether it was possible the prisoner could have been compelled for
so long a period to remain with these lawless men unless he had
wished to do so, or whether he might not have escaped from them, if
he had thought fit, at some time. The jury apparently did not
require much time for consideration. They merely whispered together
and returned a verdict of &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo;, upon which the
wretched criminal clasped his hands together over his face and
quite lost all sense of feeling. The Chief justice addressed an
eloquent harangue to the convicted felon, but he heard it not; and
when all was passed, he followed the turnkey out of the dock
mechanically.</p>

<p>So completely was he entranced by his wretched doom that the
full period of fourteen days had elapsed, during which he
remembered nothing whatever, that term being quite blotted out of
his memory, and he did not return to consciousness until the day
fixed for his execution. The morning sun beamed brightly on the
floor of his cell through the open door, and the clergyman in his
robes stood without, ready to accompany him to the place of
death.</p>

<p>The dread reality now poured upon his mind like a flood. He
looked at the cavalcade that were in waiting; but the detested form
of the hangman, bearing some of the appurtenances of his revolting
office, seemed to fill the whole field of his vision after his eye
had once rested on him. Nor could he withdraw his gaze, although
the sensation of loathing that seized upon his soul was
indescribable. The voice of the prison chaplain now sounded in his
cars. The principal turnkey entered his cell, and gently taking his
arm, led him forth.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, and from the terraced esplanade in front of
his cell door, on which they now stood, could be seen all the
varied beauties of flood and fell that adorn the scenery of Port
Jackson and far away, even the blue surface of that vast field of
waters that severed the exile from his native land. Short was the
gaze, however, that was permitted to the doomed wretch, who deemed
he had now too surely looked his last upon the outer world.</p>

<p>The melancholy procession was quickly formed. McCoy. supported
by two Presbyterian ministers, went foremost, followed by Rashleigh
and the Protestant clergyman. They were attended by the Sheriff,
the officers of the gaol, and a very few strangers, led by
curiosity, perhaps, to witness the parting struggles of an immortal
spirit ere it was finally severed from its frail tenement of clay.
The divines became more impressive in their exhortations and more
earnest in their petitions for mercy to the unhappy souls about to
depart, as the sad train entered the gallows yard, around which
were ranged many files of prisoners, most part of them heavily
ironed, who were always thus drawn up to witness the last expiation
of the crimes of their fellows.</p>

<p>Many of these who stood near paid their parting adieux to the
condemned, and the foot of the fatal tree was now attained. The
turnkey, who had not hitherto ceased to support the powerless frame
of our unhappy adventurer, here left his side for an instant. Ralph
tottered and would certainly have fallen had not the executioner
hastily stepped up, seized his arm, and cried, &ldquo;Keep up your
heart, my cock; it will soon be over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This rude mode of consolation, in some measure, recalled the
strength of the doomed man, who shrunk from the touch of the
abhorred official as he would have done from contact with a
serpent. His comrade in suffering was now placed on the dread
platform, and Rashleigh, nerving himself as for a last effort, ran,
rather than walked, up the flight of steps.</p>

<p>Within a few feet of him, outside the wall, were a crowd of the
townspeople, who stood upon a flat piece of rock that almost
overhung the area occupied by the engine of death; and these about
to die could hear their conversation as plainly as the words of the
ministers of grace, who were pouring the hopes of salvation through
the merits of a crucified redeemer into ears about to be closed for
ever.</p>

<p>Yes, here were assembled the gay, the idle, the thoughtless and
the profligate, amusing themselves with &mdash; at best &mdash; the
unmeaning nothings of ordinary gossip, full in view of two
fellow-beings for whom in ten minutes time would have passed away
and eternity, that dread and undefinable abyss, would have opened
its bosom to receive them. Nor were there wanting among this
assemblage beings in the garb of females, who vented ribald jokes
and disgusting tirades of obscenity to their compartions, levelled
either at the appearance of the unhappy convicts or that of those
who with them occupied the fell apparatus of death.</p>

<p>Ralph Rashleigh beheld the scene with dim and glazing eyes, for
he felt as if already the hand of death had clasped his soul in its
icy grip. The executioner had now adjusted the rope round the neck
of his companion, and according to custom, was about to shake hands
with his victim, when McCoy, throwing the whole weight of his body
forward, pushed the detested functionary with such force that he
reeled and fell from the fatal platform, a distance of at least
sixteen feet, into the paved courtyard beneath, while the criminal
no sooner heard the fall than he exclaimed, &ldquo;There, you
beggar, I hope I&rsquo;ve broke your blasted neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A clamour of applause burst from the assembled convicts beneath,
which yet resounded in the cars of Rashleigh when, without the
least note of preparation, the drop fell. The thundering noise of
that awful engine was the last sound of which our adventurer was
conscious for many weeks; and when he again returned to a sense of
his suffering and sorrowful existence, he was stretched upon a sick
bed in the gaol hospital, where he soon learned that his life had
been spared at the intercession of Mrs McGuffin, who had gone
personally to the Governor with a petition on his behalf, in
consequence of which his sentence had been commuted to a period of
three years&rsquo; labour at the penal settlement of Newcastle.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">For him no wretches, born to work
and weep,<br>
Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep.</p>

<p>A second sessions of the Supreme Court from that of
Rashleigh&rsquo;s condemnation was now proceeding, and by the time
it had ceased, our adventurer was judged sufficiently recovered to
be forwarded to the place of his destination. Accordingly, one day,
shortly after the termination of the trials, about 130 miserable
beings, among whom, of course, was our adventurer, were linked to a
long chain and marched through the streets, heavily ironed and
strongly guarded, until they reached the public wharf, where a
small colonial coasting vessel called the <i>Alligator</i> was then
lying in readiness to receive them.</p>

<p>They were duly marched on board and were stripped quite naked
before they were permitted to descend into the hold, that appeared
to have been prepared for their reception, a rough floor having
been laid over the shingle ballast. As fast as each man got below
he was secured by his fetters to a chain, which in its rum was
strongly fastened to the planking beneath, so that it was
absolutely impossible for him to walk, even if the height of their
place of confinement had permitted such a motion. But this was by
no means the case, as, from Rashleigh&rsquo;s description of it,
the distance from the floor to the upper deck could not have been
more than three and a half feet at the furthest, and the vessel
being very small, the number of men referred to were actually
squeezed in so tight that it was perfectly impossible for them to
be in any other position than upon their sides, while from their
close proximity one to the other, they quickly began to perspire so
profusely that reeks of vapour almost as dense as smoke could be
perceived rolling up the hatchway, the closing of which, if it were
but for half an hour, must have resulted in inevitable suffocation
to the whole herd of hapless wretches.</p>

<p>Ralph had read a great deal respecting the horrors of the slave
trade, but never until now had he any faint conception of the
shocking reality; and the only thing from which he could draw
consolation was that as they had got but about a hundred miles in
all to sail, the voyage and consequent suffering would be but of
brief duration.</p>

<p>In a short time the vessel unmoored and the wind being fair,
soon cleared the harbour and got out to sea, where a fresh gale
appeared to be blowing; for the <i>Alligator</i> pitched heavily
and shipped many billows, which, of course, making their way
through the open hatchway into the hold, were at first hailed with
delight by the parched sufferers below, whose feverish bodies were
cooled by this immersion in the briny fluid. But in a little while
the water increased in their prison to such an extent that they
were obliged to adopt very painful positions in order to keep their
heads above it. For several hours did this continue, until the
captain was obliged by a shift of wind to put into a haven under
his lee called Broken Bay; and then the unhappy convicts thought
themselves fortunate in having the water pumped off, leaving them
the wet floor to repose upon.</p>

<p>In brief, their voyage lasted forty-eight hours, during which
period they were parched with thirst, very few being so fortunate
as to obtain a single drink of water. Half a rotten and mouldy
biscuit to each man formed their sole sustenance; and to crown all,
they were cramped into a noxious hole, rather than hold, where the
mephitic vapour arising from the breath of 130 men was increased by
ordure, urine and excrement of every kind, among which the
sufferers lay perforce.</p>

<p>This scene of complicated horrors, the intensity of which was in
no whit lessened by the ruthless character of the inmates of this
floating hell, was at length brought to a close by their arrival at
Newcastle, where they shortly afterwards landed, naked as they
were, upon the beach, and were compelled to perform sundry very
necessary ablutions before their clothing was returned to them.</p>

<p>Here they remained until they were inspected by the military
commandant, a personage of stern and uncompromising severity, the
absolute rigour of whose sway well merited the appellation bestowed
upon him of &ldquo;King of the Coal River.&rdquo; Immediately on
the close of this muster they were told off to various scenes of
labour; and it fell to the lot of Rashleigh, with seventeen others,
to be drafted for employment in the <i>old</i> coal mine, so called
to distinguish it from another shaft, which had been recently
commenced.</p>

<p>At the mouth of this work they were received by an overseer, the
natural fierceness of whose grim physiognomy was not lessened by a
plentiful griming of coal dust. He quickly called his clerk
&ldquo;to take the likenesses&rdquo; of those whose ill fortune had
newly subjected them to his oppression. The clerk, a miserable,
half-starved, downcast-looking, ragged being, soon performed his
avocation with fear and trembling at the oft-repeated rude threats
of his stern superior, and the men were lowered consecutively into
the darksome orifice that appeared to gape for them.</p>

<p>On their arrival at the bottom of the chasm, a scene that had at
least novelty to recommend it to our adventurer met his wondering
gaze. Seven low passages appeared, that opened into the space
around the termination of the shaft. They were dimly illuminated by
small lamps; but at the farther extremity of each avenue there was
a perfect coruscation of blazing lights, in front of which various
groups of men were plying different branches of their thrift in
toilsome haste, their extra diligence being apparently occasioned
by the presence of the superior who had received the new-comers, a
specimen of whose brutality they had an early opportunity of
witnessing; for no sooner had he landed ftom the <i>skep</i>
(bucket) in which he descended than his vigilant eye rested on one
of the waggons that a party of prisoners had dragged along one of
the passages. This not being filled to his liking, he, without any
ceremony, but with many distasteful terms of abuse and energetic
oaths, began to lay about him with a stout cudgel he carried, and
dispensed his forcible favours so heartily that in a few seconds
not one of the luckless gang belonging to the waggon in question
was standing erect. After having thus knocked them all down, he
began next to beat them until they arose again, and fairly
cudgelled them off out of sight with the waggon.</p>

<p>On his return after this <i>agreeable</i> exercise, rather out
of breath, he turned his attention to the new-comers, and dividing
them into parties of six, he gave each subdivision charge of a
waggon; and these led the way through one of the long galleries,
followed by the waggons, until they all arrived at the end, which
was an open area of considerable extent, where two or three large
fires of coal were burning, by whose light, aided by that of their
lamps; the miners were delving out masses of coal, at an immense
heap of which he finally paused, directing a man who appeared to be
overseer of this part of the work, to &ldquo;take the new chums in
charge, and set them on&rdquo;. This was quickly done. They were
told to fill their waggons with coal, to draw them back to die
opening, and there to upset the contents as the man at the shaft
should direct them.</p>

<p>They continued to do this, stimulated by the blows and threats
of their harsh taskmaster, until night, when each received a small
portion of boiled grains of maize and much less rotten salt beef,
which, with water, formed their whole food. The wretched miners
soon after lay down in any part of the works they thought fit,
bedding being here totally unknown except to the deputy overseers,
and clothing of any kind whatever unworn by the workmen. In fact,
the extreme heat of this subterranean place of abode, arising from
want of air, and enhanced by the numerous fires maintained, would
have rendered the lightest apparel an encumbrance. As for beds or
blankets, there were various heaps of sand, which, being loose,
were soft enough; and on these such of the convicts as were curious
about lying <i>luxuriously</i> used to repose themselves.</p>

<p>The luckless wretches condemned to this kind of labour only left
the mine once a week, on Saturday afternoons, when they were all
drawn up and compelled to wash themselves and their clothing in the
salt water; and after the latter articles wEre dry, all were
marched to the convict barracks, where they abode until daylight on
Monday morning, at which period they resumed their labour.</p>

<p>The first Saturday afternoon of our adventurer&rsquo;s sojourn
at this miserable spot, as they were all bathing together in the
sea, he noticed that not one of those who had been there longer
than himself was without certain highly significant marks upon the
back or breech, most frequently, indeed, on both, that told of the
recent and severe application of the <i>cat</i>. A man to whom he
remarked that &ldquo;punishment was plentiful enough here
apparently&rdquo;, replied with a grin, &ldquo;Aye. There&rsquo;s
plenty of <i>that</i>, anyway; and so you will say soon, for
to-morrow is <i>pay</i> day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph did not choose to ask any further questions, and they were
soon after, to the number of five hundred, shut up in a spacious
room of the prisoners&rsquo; barracks, where they were left to pass
the night on the floor as they thought fit.</p>

<p>Just at dawn the next day, <i>being sunday</i>, they were
aroused by the hoarse voice of a convict barrack officer, who
turned them out into the yard of that edifice, where they were all
drawn up around some implements, which the increasing light soon
showed Rashleigh were triangles for securing men about to be
flogged. Beside these implements was placed a table, at which sat
apparently a clerk; and four scourgers stood beside the triangles,
having their instruments of torture laid in fell array upon a long
bench near them.</p>

<p>Our exile had scarcely completed his survey of all these dread
preparations when the clash of arms and the roll of a drum
announced the approach of the haughty potentate who was to set all
this machinery of suffering in motion. An opening was quickly made
in the ranks of assembled convicts, and the &ldquo;Captain&rdquo;
marched in, attended by a sergeant&rsquo;s guard of soldiers, who
fell into a double rank behind him as he took his sEat at the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dash my old rags,&rdquo; said a fellow standing near
Rashleigh, upon observing that the commandant was dressed in his
suit of full regimental uniform. &ldquo;Look out, my lads! The
<i>cove</i> has got on his fighting jacket. It&rsquo;s a-going to
be a regular field day!&rdquo; And full many a wretch who knew the
signification and truth of this prediction writhed HIs back in
anticipation of the warm infliction so many of them were doomed to
taste ere long.</p>

<p>The clerk now opened his book. The overseer of the coal mines
was first called on. He made his appearance, and a loutish
reverence, to the awful authority, who ordered him sternly to begin
his punishment list.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles Chattey&rdquo; stood foremost on this black
beadroll, and when this name was shouted by the stentorian lungs of
one of the scourgers, a little duck-legged Londoner stood
forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he been doing?&rdquo; enquired the
&ldquo;Captain&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neglected his work, Your Honour,&rdquo; was the brief
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hundreds lashes,&rdquo; was the equally prompt
sentence. And the luckless wight was stripped and tied up in a
twinkling at one of the triangles.</p>

<p>Three others were <i>tried</i> in as many minutes and took their
places at the remaining sets.</p>

<p>The drummer, having received the signal, began to tap his drum
in a slow and deliberate manner, marking time for the lashes, as
they were inflicted by the willing and brawny arms of the
flagellators, who were selected for this office from among the most
muscular prisoners that would accept such a hideous berth, which,
as before remarked, entailed upon them ever after the execrations
of their fellow-convicts. And even while they held it, in this
place, they were looked upon with distrust by their superiors, a
constable always standing behind the back of the operating scourger
with a stout stick, with which he scrupled not to strike the
striker when his blows did not fall heavily enough upon the back of
the culprit who was undergoing punishment.</p>

<p>In short, not to dwell too long upon so revolting a scene, about
fifty men received more or less lashes, but none fewer than 75, the
commandant at the same time vigilantly superintending the
infliction of the scourge, and frequently, towards the conclusion,
stimulating the nearly jaded floggers to increased exertion by
threats of punishing themselves. Nor was this ceremony concluded
until long after nine o&rsquo;clock, when the men in the ranks were
dismissed to their wretched breakfast of boiled corn grains, half a
pound of which, with an equal quantity of very badly cured meat,
formed the daily allowance of each convict.</p>

<p>With reference to the above examinations, as they were called,
it is to be observed that the ceremony of an oath to the truth of
the complaints being deemed superfluous, so, in like manner, was
the form dispensed with, of asking the unlucky wretches charged
with misdeeds what defence they had to make. The convict overseers
simply stated their causes of complaint, when a sentence of some
kind followed immediately as a mere routine of duty.</p>

<p>The next day Ralph Rashleigh returned to the darksome scene of
his labours in the mine; and all that week himself and his
companions wrought at removing the huge pile of coal to the shaft.
This was only completed by dint of extra haste, under the threats
of dire punishment, in case of failure, from their overseers, in
time to admit of their leaving the mine with the others on the
ensuing Saturday. On the day following this the commandant
performed his usual Sabbath morning&rsquo;s service, when more than
four thousand lashes were &ldquo;served out&rdquo; as they called
it, among about fifty men. This day was subsequently spent like the
other Sunday. namely, in lounging about the large hall of the
prisoners&rsquo; barracks, to which they were restricted when out
of the mine, where they resumed their labour next morning, Ralph
being that day attached to another party, whose duty it was among
them to deliver a certain quantity of coals at the pit&rsquo;s
mouth daily, failing which, in the briefly expressive language of
the overseer, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d be flogged till they
did&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In this dreary mode did our unhappy adventurer spend nine
tedious months of starvation and unremitting labour, during which
period he received 650 lashes for deficiency in the allotted task
and other trivial offences. At length, he was one Sunday brought
before the commandant on a charge of incorrigible laziness
preferred by the principal overseer of the coal mine, and that
officer administered one hundred lashes to him as a parting salute,
directing that he should on the following day be sent to work naked
in the limeburners&rsquo; gang.</p>

<p>After receiving his punishment, our exile was delivered into the
care of the gaoler in order that he might be confined until he was
forwarded to the place of punishment specified in his sentence; and
the same afternoon an incident occurred which perhaps may afford to
the reader some slight idea of the state of affairs in Newcastle at
that period.</p>

<p>The commandant had six milch cows allowed to him for the supply
of his household. So much of their produce as was not consumed in
the state of milk was set aside and the cream taken off it to be
manufactured into butter for his table. After this was skimmed, the
refuse was given to the pigs; but there was a young scamp of a
convict boy, who belonged to a party allotted for the service of
supplying &ldquo;Government house&rdquo; (the commandant&rsquo;s
residence) with fuel, and this youngster, as it appeared, was in
the habit of watching his opportunity, as soon as the skimmed milk
was given to the inhabitants of the sty, when he would insinuate
himself into their society to partake of the luscious meal.</p>

<p>The poor pigs seemed not to thrive so well as they might have
been expected to do, while jack the woodboy got as round as a butt;
and the commandant&rsquo;s lady, who commiserated the lean state of
her favourites &mdash; for she was very partial to pork &mdash;
thought some surreptitious means must be resorted to in defrauding
them of their dinners, which she resolved to see given to them
herself for the future. Strange to say, even this tender solicitude
did not seem to produce the wished-for effect. The dame was certain
that they <i>did</i> get their food; and yet they got no fatter. At
last an accident unveiled the mystery.</p>

<p>The commandant, upon this day, in returning to the house from
the garden, heard an outcry in the pigsty. As he passed the back of
it, looking over, he perceived an ancient sow, who had been named
Lucy in <i>honour</i> of his lady, and she, being naturally irate
at the injustice of the horrid peculations she had daily witnessed,
seemed at length to have screwed up her courage to the sticking
point, and was no longer to be kept away from the trough by the
intruder that had taken possession of it, and who, alternately
swilling the wash and kicking the rightful owner to keep her off,
now lay at full length enjoying this <i>delicious</i> mess.</p>

<p>The commandant, equally enraged with the ill-used animal, had
yet the prudence to suppress his wrath for a few minutes, because
he was so placed that although he could see part of a human body in
the sty, yet he could not tell who it was, and if he had spoken,
the intruder might easily escape without his being able either to
stop him or see his face.</p>

<p>Under these afflicting circumstances, the grave and haughty
commander felt himself called upon for exertion; and he <i>actually
ran</i> round the house, through the hall, calling lustily upon his
lady, who followed him to the back yard, full of wonder at what
could be the matter; when lo, right before the pigsty, the
commandant halted, puffing and blowing with the unusual exertion.
His lady joined him there. The angry officer, quite out of breath,
could only point at the depredator, who, unaware of the approach of
any interruption, still continued to enjoy his unhallowed meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you scoundrel!&rdquo; shrieked the lady.</p>

<p>The detected pig robber raised his head. Horror upon horrors,
his eye caught that of the commandant, who roared out for a
constable, whom he sent off for the scourgers, resolving that this
atrocious offence should meet equally prompt and condign
punishment.</p>

<p>In a few seconds six flagellators, bearing their cats and
triangles, hastened to the spot. Jack was seized up by the wrists
and feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him a hundred!&rdquo; roared the commandant, and
observing that the officiating flogger only pulled off his frock,
he ordered him also to doff his shirt and stationed another
scourger behind the man who was about to punish the delinquent,
with orders, if the first did not do his duty, that he was to
<i>flog</i> him. The punishment now began; but whether it was owing
to the obstinacy of the culprit or the fear of the flagellator
preventing his exertion, Jack endured four or five lashes without
wincing, far less crying out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harder, sir, harder yet!&rdquo; roared the commandant,
who now quite lost his patience; and he ordered the second flogger
to set on flogging the first.</p>

<p>Still the woodboy scorned to betray any pain, until the
&ldquo;Captain&rdquo; cursed and swore like a maniac that neither
one nor the other of the scourgers was striking at all! And he set
a third operator to punish the second, a fourth to punish the
third, and so on, until the whole six scourgers were pegging away
at the backs of each other, the first one flogging the woodboy, and
the commandant himself lashing the last with his horsewhip. Under
these extraordinary circumstances, no regard was of course paid to
the number of lashes inflicted, and it was not until the
&ldquo;King of the Coal River&rdquo; was quite worn out that the
scene terminated by his dismissing all the scourgers upon the spot
and sentencing the woodboy to work at the limeburners, by which
means Ralph Rashleigh came into possession of the tale.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">Poor wretch! The mother that him bore,<br>
If she had been in presence there,<br>
She had not known her child.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the latter part of the last sentence passed by
the commandant upon Ralph Rashleigh, he was stripped perfectly
naked the ensuing morning, being allowed, however, to retain a
portion of his shirt to serve as a garment, similar to the manner
of the fig-leaf aprons of our first parents. He was then loaded
with another pair of leg irons in addition to those which he had
constantly worn since his arrival at Newcastle, and being now
placed on board a lime punt in the charge of a constable, was
transferred to the north shore of the Coal river, a spot equally
sterile and forbidding in appearance to that which he had left,
both being mere hummocks of sand, scantily clad with verdure of a
peculiar nature consisting only of patches &mdash; like
angels&rsquo; visits, few and far between &mdash; of couch grass
and a few stunted bushes.</p>

<p>But the naked misery of the limeburners was even worse than that
of the side on which the settlement stood, the latter being at
least redeemed in some degree from the dull monotony of absolute
barrenness by a patch or two of garden ground, beside the bustle
incidental to a place which contained full fifteen hundred
convicts, some of whom were perpetually passing to and fro. Here,
on the contrary, were no gardens and only two ranges of wretched
hovels, enclosed within a tall palisade of strips made from the
outer coat of the cabbage palm.</p>

<p>At the moment of Ralph&rsquo;s arrival the miserable beings who
were stationed here, being all of them exiles and outcasts even
from the horrors of Newcastle, sent from <i>thence</i> for
<i>punishment</i>, were busily employed loading boats with marine
shells that were burned but not slacked for making lime. This was
done, amid coarse vituperation and oft-repeated blows from the
convict overseers, by carrying the shells in baskets into the
boats, in which the cargoes were stowed in bulk.</p>

<p>Rashleigh had no sooner landed than a basket was given to him.
He was ordered to go on with the rest; and when he ventured to urge
the soreness of his back from the receipt of a hundred lashes only
the day before as a reason why he ought to be put to something else
for a short time, the wretch to whom he applied, pretending at
first to look very compassionate, asked to see the sore place. When
Ralph, with great pain, withdrew the rag from it that he had
applied, being the only dressing within his reach, this brute in
human shape threw a handful of lime, that he had held concealed,
upon the festering sore, and then bestowed a smart cut with his
stick upon the suffering spot, bidding the poor fellow,
&ldquo;Begone to your work, you blasted crawling caterpillar, or
I&rsquo;ll soon serve you ten times worse than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh was thus fain to take his basket; and though the
agitation of the waves soon drenched his sore with salt water, when
the slackening lime hissed red-hot among his excoriated flesh,
giving him a degree of agony that may far better be imagined than
described, he was obliged to keep on at the run until ten
o&rsquo;clock at night; when the last of the boats being loaded,
the weary starving wretches, who had now been sixteen hours at
unremitted hard work, were at length permitted to withdraw to their
as wretched abode, to pass the hours of rest in the best manner
they could. Happy was he who had a pile of dry seaweed, and could
cajole the overseers into permission to let him keep it. But this
was indeed a rare luxury. Perhaps not five out of the 150 men that
were then employed at this fit prototype of the infernal regions
could boast of any kind of accommodation whatever to lie upon, save
the rough slabs that formed the sleeping places.</p>

<p>To give any idea of the state of suffering that was endured by
the emaciated wretches about twenty years since at this spot far
exceeds the descriptive powers of the author of this tale. Let the
reader, however, conceive it from the following brief delineation
of some of the circumstances attending a sojourn there, gathered
from the different persons consulted as authorities, the most
favourable of whose representations have been selected.</p>

<p>In the first place, no clothing save the apron before mentioned,
or any bedding whatever, was allowed to be used here, whether in
the nearly tropical heats of summer or the freezing nights of
winter; but every man wore at least two pairs of irons and very
many even four or six pairs each; and at all hours, according to
circumstances relating to the state of the tides. the wretched
convicts were obliged to labour always breast-high in the sea
before they could unload their baskets, as the draught of water
required by the boats would not permit them to come nearer than
this to the shore; and as before mentioned, there was no wharf.
Thus, in the summer the heat of the sun peeled the skin from every
portion of their bodies, and in winter the excessive coldness of
the ocean on that naked and exposed beach chilled their very
marrow. From this labour they were obliged at once to withdraw to a
slabbed building pervious on every side to the wind, where their
only resource for warmth in the winter nights was to huddle as
close as possible together. The allowance of food, also, was
miserably insufficient, consisting only of three and a half pounds
of maize in cob weekly, with three and a half pounds of very
ill-cured salt beef. Even this wretched pittance was subject to the
peculations of the overseers, who helped themselves freely out of
the common stock and then divided the rest among the wretched
labourers, who dared not grumble, or the brutal tyranny of the
others would be let loose upon them with all the lawless fury of
wicked and ignorant malice.</p>

<p>Last, though not least, there were no stated hours of labour,
the only rule being that the overseers were bound to make the men
work as long as they could and do as much as they could; which they
generally acted up to the spirit of by obliging them four days in
the week at least to labour fifteen hours out of the
twenty-four.</p>

<p>Besides all this, they were exposed to periodical visitations
from the commandant; for although the trebly exiled wretches were
put entirely out of the pale of society so far as regarded the
comforts and even necessaries of civilized life, yet they were not
by any means suffered to deem themselves out of the reach of the
iron grasp of discipline, which this petty imitator of the
haughtiest monarch that ever wore a crown wielded with a severity
that has perhaps been equalled, but certainly never could have been
excelled. His presence at any of the outstations under his sway was
ever the signal for an inordinate use of the <i>cat</i>. He never
travelled a mile to observe the progress made by any working party
without being accompanied by two scourgers, who bore an ample
supply of their implements of torture; and if his piercing glance
detected any flagging from the most arduous exertion on the part of
a working man, without deigning to enquire into the cause, whether
arising from positive physical inability to keep pace with the
others or not, the offender was called to him as he sat on
horseback, and after a few imperious words of reproach, tied up to
the nearest fence or standing tree, where a number of lashes, never
less than fifty, was quickly administered to him, and he was sent
back, bleeding from innumerable wounds, to resume his implement of
labour.</p>

<p>In fact, whether from depravity of taste or utter want of any
feeling, no exhibition appeared to delight this modern Caligula so
much as when, on his Sabbath morning <i>amusement</i>, four
miserable wretches were groaning and writhing before him at once
under the infliction of what is to most men a transcendently
revolting punishment to witness. No music appeared to delight his
ears more exquisitely than the agonised yells of a wretched being
who felt the lash for the first time; and on such occasions the
fiendish joy that sparkled in his eyes would appear to dilate his
form to nearly double its original size, and his every word and
gesture, which, of course, he took no pains to conceal, fully
proved that such scenes and sounds were supereminently gratifying
to his soul; and accordingly, he took the greatest pains to prolong
the <i>enviable enjoyment</i> as long as possible, frequently
roaring out to the scourger in tones of thunder, &ldquo;not to
hurry&rdquo;, &ldquo;to take time&rdquo;, &ldquo;strike
harder&rdquo;, etc.</p>

<p>Nay, upon one occasion, in Rashleigh&rsquo;s presence, when one
of these ministers of torture did not appear to please this
<i>humane</i> man of power in the vigour with which he dealt out
the lash, the &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; rushed upon him and belaboured
the scourger himself with a cane, bidding him at the same time,
&ldquo;Go on, sir! Go on!!&rdquo; And every stroke the scourger
applied to the back of the culprit was accompanied by one upon his
own shoulders from the commandant&rsquo;s cane, with a loud shout
from the latter, &ldquo;Harder yet, sir! Harder yet!!&rdquo; until
at last the weapon flew into fragments in the hands of this
<i>splendid specimen</i> of a British officer!</p>

<p>When the dreaded commander visited the limeburners&rsquo;
station, it was no uncommon proceeding, if the number of men
brought before him by the overseer for trial, and of course
punishment, did not tally with his ideas of propriety, for him to
command the whole body of men there, overseers and all, to be
ranked in line before him, when he would pick out every second or
third man with his own hand and order them to receive fifty lashes
apiece, declaring that he was certain they had deserved it over and
over again since they last were flogged, or if not, that they would
be sure to merit it before he should see them again! Then, if the
boats were in the bay waiting to be loaded, he would compel the
bleeding sufferers to place their baskets of lime upon their
mangled backs and wade into the salt water with them until the
agony of their wounds, with the mingled application of the briny
fluid and the unslacked lime, became almost too poignant for
humanity to endure; and several wretches, in Rashleigh&rsquo;s
sojourn, actually drowned themselves in the sight of the
commandant, who merely remarked, &ldquo;It will save Government
rope, and spare the hangman a job!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lest this picture should appear overcharged respecting the
partiality of this officer for flogging those under his sway, the
reader is requested to remember that corporal punishment was of
almost daily occurrence in the British Navy, as well as the Army,
twenty-five years ago; and it is very probable the <i>gallant</i>
captain in question had been selected for his present command to
control upwards of two thousand lawless desperadoes from his known
severity in his military capacity. And he might have considered
that nothing short of absolutely breaking down the bodies as well
as the minds of the ruffians &mdash; for such no doubt they were
for the most part &mdash; could either sufficiently punish them for
their past crimes or prevent them from committing further
atrocities in the exile to which they were doomed. If such were the
views of this <i>humane</i> official, they were completely
answered, at least in the case of the limeburners&rsquo; gang, for
the one single master feeling of extreme pinching hunger,
independent of their other woes, was amply sufficient to debilitate
the person and paralyze the mind of the strongest of the human
species in less than three months&rsquo; endurance of this rigorous
discipline, by or before which time they had become so weak in body
that one of the overseers, and he was by no means strong, could
knock two of their heads together as if they had been children, in
spite of their struggles; and their minds were so abjectly debased
that they were perpetually wailing and crying for food, anxiously
seeking the most revolting substances with which to appease their
ever craving hunger. Thus even the grains of maize that were voided
by the oxen were picked out of their excrement and eagerly devoured
by these starving wretches.</p>

<p>Happy was the man to whose share a soft bone fell among his
pittance of meat. Twenty pairs of eyes would he enviously fixed
upon him while he voraciously gnawed it; and if at last, when his
jaws were quite fatigued with the exertion, he threw any portion of
the bone away, a scramble, and as certainly a fight, would ensue
among the bystanders, who should obtain the <i>enviable</i> morsel,
a circumstance through which Rashleigh was unwittingly the cause of
a fellow-sufferer&rsquo;s death on the second day after his arrival
at this abode of horrors.</p>

<p>He having cast a bone of this description down, a scuffle ensued
to obtain it, during which two men caught hold of the prize; but as
they could not agree who had the priority of claim, they referred
the matter to Ralph as the original possessor of the coveted boon.
He wished them to divide it; but they would not do this, both
vehemently insisting that our adventurer should decide who ought to
keep the whole. At length he did so to the best of his idea of the
justice of the case, and the vanquished party withdrew, looking
daggers at both Rashleigh and his opponent. The latter, in the mean
time, after partly crushing his prize between two stones, sat down
on the earth, with his back against a shed, to discuss it, which he
did most greedily and with the greatest apparent enjoyment.</p>

<p>Our adventurer was gazing at him, half in pity and half in dread
that he should soon be as craving as the other, when a slight sound
caused him to lift up his head; and just behind the unconscious
wretch, who was chewing the bone so greedily, Rashleigh was struck
with horror to see the man that had striven with him for the
possession of his morsel, who, with features now expressing the
most fiendish rage, stood over his late opponent bearing an
enormous iron rake, used for gathering shells on the beach, which
he uplifted as in act to strike his victim on the head. Ralph
uttered an involuntary cry and sprang forward to arrest the
murderer&rsquo;s arm. Alas, he was too late! The blow had fallen,
crashing through the sufferer&rsquo;s skull with such irresistible
force that the man&rsquo;s head was crushed as if it had been
paper; while the hungry wretch who perpetrated this atrocity cried
out, &ldquo;Aha, I&rsquo;ve got it <i>now</i>!&rdquo; and seized
the piece of half-gnawed bone that had dropped from his
victim&rsquo;s nerveless grasp, and which, though it was now all
bespattered with brains and blood from the dying man, yet the
other, brutalised by hunger, crammed in that state into his mouth,
holding out both his hands to the overseer, who now came running
up, to secure him with a pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p>Atrocities like these, Rashleigh was informed, were of frequent
occurrence, and he was particularly cautioned by a shipmate of his,
whom he met with in this gloomy place, never to save any portion of
his food &mdash; even if he could &mdash; for another meal, as
there were many men in that abode of utter despair, who
<i>would</i> not, in fact, who <i>had</i> not, scrupled to deprive
a fellow-creature of life for the sake of a few grains of maize or
a couple of ounces of their rotten salt beef.</p>

<p>A day or two after this, chance most unexpectedly provided our
adventurer and some others with several hearty meals which proved
most acceptable to them. They had been sent out in the bush to cut
timber as fuel for the kilns; and as the country was very scrubby,
they were necessarily much out of sight of their harsh taskmasters.
The team of oxen that was to draw the wood in passed a short
distance away from Ralph and his associates; and even the cattle at
this <i>most delectable</i> spot being well-nigh starved to death,
just at this instant one of the poor beasts, utterly worn out with
hunger and hard work, fell down, and though he was stimulated by
blows and curses, nay, at last &mdash; rare humanity in a
bullock-driver! &mdash; even lifted up again by those that drove
the team, all proved useless. The unhappy ox,</p>

<p><i>His labours o&rsquo;er</i>,<br>
<i>Stretched his stiff limbs to rise no more</i>.</p>

<p>The carters were therefore compelled to take off his yoke and
leave him there.</p>

<p>Rashleigh and his companions, who had been unobserved spectators
of the whole affair, now rushed out of their concealment and
quickly immolated the poor beast with their axes, dismembering his
quivering limbs with the speed of thought and bearing them away in
triumph. They effectually concealed their prey and withdrew to a
distant part of the thicket before the overseer could arrive at the
spot with the drivers to look at the fallen bullock, of whom,
however, their astonishment was very great to find no part
remaining save the head, feet and entrails. Their search and the
subsequent enquiry proved utterly fruitless, although both were
conducted with cunning, amply exemplifying the accuracy of the old
proverb, &ldquo;Set a thief to catch a thief.&rdquo; And Rashleigh,
with his comrades in this act of spoliation, fared sumptuously,
though of course very stealthily, for several days upon the meat,
if that might be called so which had once formed part of the
carcase of an unfortunate animal attenuated by famine to the last
stage of his miserable existence, so that, in comparison with
<i>him</i>, the leanest of the lean kine seen in the dream of
Egypt&rsquo;s Pharaoh might have been the very alderman of
oxen.</p>

<p>Amid all the scenes of oppression, woe and starvation that were
of constant recurrence at this Ultima Thule of the moral world, it
may perhaps by some readers be wondered that the men did not break
out into open and actual mutiny, and rather bravely earn death at
once than endure so many prolonged evils, which in countless cases
seemed only to be avenues of approach for the grim tyrant, in some
one of his many most fearful shapes, at last.</p>

<p>The reasons why they did not, in short,</p>

<p><i>Take arms against a sea of troubles</i><br>
<i>And by opposing end them</i>
</p>

<p>may probably have been that at the limeburners they were too
much broken in spirit by their complicated sufferings to attempt
anything beyond the stealthy murder of some poor wretch for his
pittance of food, and at the settlement of Newcastle each man
feared the other, for Ralph very quickly found out the untruth of
the proverb that &ldquo;there is honour among thieves&rdquo;. So
far from this being the case, those who made the loudest
professions of their staunch manhood as being incapable of
betraying a comrade, were often found to concert schemes of escape
or robbery, and in the hour of need, to turn abruptly round and
denounce, or even prosecute to conviction, those whom they had
themselves most probably induced to join in such enterprises, with
the offence of committing or at times, of only meditating them.</p>

<p>Thus each prisoner stood in awe of the other, and as traitors
like those above spoken of were always rewarded with some trifling
post of comparative ease and idleness, no man dared to trust his
fellow, and all were thus held in subjection far more by their own
fears than by the numerical strength of their guards or the
physical power of their superiors.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">Merrily, merrily goes the bark<br>
Before the gale she bounds;<br>
As flies the dolphin from the shark,<br>
Or the deer before the hounds.</p>

<p>One day, shortly after the death and demolition of the
unfortunate ox, Rashleigh and some others were dispatched to cut a
quantity of mangrove timber in a swamp, this wood being required to
be sent to Sydney, where it was to be used for the manufacture of
stone-cutter&rsquo;s mallets, as it was both light and tough. In
selecting the proper pieces for this purpose, the men were
dispersed in all directions, nearly up to their necks in mud and
water; and our adventurer, having strayed at last as far as the
bank of the river, was much surprised to see a boat which
apparently lay dry upon a sand-bank, having canted a little on one
side, no person being observable either in or near it.</p>

<p>As the place where the boat lay was secluded from observation by
a projecting point of land covered with mangroves, Rashleigh
thought he might gratify his curiosity with impunity by looking
into the little vessel. Accordingly he waded to the side of it and
found to his great surprise that a man was lying fast asleep in its
bottom. The boat here appeared, too, of much greater size when he
looked into it than when seen from the shore; and it contained two
half-decks, as they are called, under each of which two or three
persons could sleep comfortably. There seemed to be a quantity of
provisions and other things on board, and Ralph could also perceive
the butt ends of some muskets peeping out from under a sail, which
was appended to the mast that lay fore and aft along the
thwarts.</p>

<p>Quick as lightning a hope of liberty darted into his brain. The
breeze was blowing freshly down the river to seaward, and he
hastily returned in quest of some companions. Unperceived by any
overseer, he soon collected several of the men, and Ralph having
briefly explained his hopes and his views, they were easily induced
to risk one bold attempt for life and freedom, the bare thought of
which animated their pallid features with unwonted fires and
appeared to nerve their debilitated frames to dare any danger.</p>

<p>On returning under Rashleigh&rsquo;s guidance to the boat, they
found its unlucky occupant still fast asleep. They quickly pushed
the bark off the bank she lay on into the deep water that flowed
swiftly beside her and drew up the anchor that held her there. They
were now drifting rapidly down towards the harbour&rsquo;s mouth;
but on their quickly setting up the mast, the sail swelled, and oh!
what joy filled their breasts as they stood over to the southern
shore and placed an island between themselves and their late
dreaded scene of confinement.</p>

<p>When they were thus sheltered from immediate view, they awoke
the slumbering boat-keeper, whose consternation was dreadful at
observing in his boat upwards of half a dozen gaunt, animated
skeletons, perfectly naked, smeared with filth and mud, and their
faces overgrown with hair from their heads and beards. One of the
fugitives held a musket to his head, ordering him to strip in
silence. This he was fain to comply with, and his clothes being put
on by one of their number, who had been selected from his knowledge
of the management of a boat for this purpose, the rest lay down all
together in the bottom of the bark, lest their nakedness might
attract observation, and consequently, pursuit from the
garrison.</p>

<p>When the helmsman judged he was at a sufficient distance from
Limeburners&rsquo; Bay, he recrossed the harbour before the boat
approached too near the settlement, and the bells being now ringing
there for the men&rsquo;s dinner-hour, the fugitives rejoiced in
the idea that nearly all the people at the town of Newcastle would
be under cover of their several dwellings when they passed on the
river before it, and consequently that there would not be so many
eyes to observe their motions.</p>

<p>The breeze continued to favour them. In a very short space they
were opposite the wharf of the coal mines, and in reply to the
anxious questions poured thick and fast upon him by his comrades
below, who could not see anything, the helmsman continued to report
progress every now and then, assuring them that all was right. They
were soon abreast of Nobby&rsquo;s island, a bluff rock which
projects out of nearly the centre of the mouth of Hunter&rsquo;s
river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blow, good breeze! Another mile, and all is safe,&rdquo;
was uttered in tones of triumph by the steersman when &ldquo;Boat
ahoy!&rdquo; was thundered in their ears from the rocky islet.</p>

<p>Forgetful of prudential considerations in the anxiety of the
moment, two of the naked runaways partially raised themselves from
their place of concealment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haul down your sail directly or I&rsquo;ll fire into your
boat!&rdquo; roared the person on shore, who proved to be one of
the military officers that had gone on the rock to shoot sea-fowl;
and finding the fugitives paid no attention to his repeated cries,
he shouted once more and louder than ever, &ldquo;Halloo! Shore
ahoy! Help!! Mutiny!!!&rdquo; at the same time levelling his piece
and firing. But the shot spattered harmlessly far astern of the
boat, in the water, the little bark meanwhile still increasing the
distance between the parties.</p>

<p>All concealment being now useless, the runaways stood up in the
boat and Rashleigh could observe the whole settlement was in
commotion, aroused probably by the firing, for the report of the
officer&rsquo;s piece had been repeated by one of the sentries
posted at the signal station, and the verandah of Government house
being full in his sight, he could even observe the dreaded person
of their haughty commandant, who rushed out, and mounting a horse,
galloped down to the sea-beach, where by his gestures he seemed to
be urging some men, who were busily launching a boat, to increased
exertion.</p>

<p>One party of soldiers quickly came flying, rather than running,
down the hill to their commander, and another body of military, who
had, in the hurry of the first alarm, apparently posted towards the
gaol, now made their appearance upon the high ground at the back of
Nobby&rsquo;s island. The alarm bells were rung, and two pieces of
cannon that were placed upon a green in front of the Government
house, being hastily loaded, were fired, one of the balls from
which whizzed just over their little mast, and then, plunging into
the sea, appeared to skip from wave to wave until it buried itself
deep in a bank on the northern shore, raising a cloud of sand in
its career.</p>

<p>Until now Rashleigh had not observed a little boat containing
only two persons that had put off from the rocky islet directly
after the fugitives had passed. These were the officer who had
first given the alarm, and his servant, who, although they had
apparently but one fire-arm between them, were yet bold enough to
persevere in a chase against such overwhelming odds, both of
numbers and weapons, for the runaways, on searching the bark they
had seized, discovered a good store of powder, ball and six muskets
on board. The little boat, being so much smaller and lighter than
that in which Rashleigh was, now gained rapidly upon them, and our
adventurer hailed the officer, begging him as he valued his life to
keep off, at the same time intimating the number of their weapons,
which were also presented at the young ensign; but the latter
perhaps thought he had gone too far to retract with honour, and the
only reply he deigned to give was by discharging his gun, on which
the steersman&rsquo;s left arm dropped motionless to his side; and
the report of six muskets from the convicts&rsquo; boat sounded the
requiem of the gallant young soldier, who, as Rashleigh could see,
fell bleeding overboard. His attendant was now too much occupied in
endeavouring to recover his master to pursue the chase, even if he
had been disposed to do so, and the fugitives had leisure to
observe their other pursuers.</p>

<p>Foremost of these was a whale-boat, apparently impelled by
sixteen oars, helped on by an enormous sail, which seemed to make
her actually fly through the water. As the rowers bent to the
stroke, she appeared, at least in the estimation of our terrified
adventurer, positively to bound off the face of the deep. In the
bow of this boat, bare-headed and apparently stimulating the
boatmen by threats, oaths and promises to increase their already
almost superhuman efforts, stood the commandant, with a musket in
his hand, which he now and then presented at the escaping convicts
as if measuring the distance between them with his eyes. Then,
withdrawing it, he would shake his fist in the direction of the
fugitives, turning at last again to the boatmen, his urgent
imprecations to whom began now faintly to be borne on the wings of
the breeze past the ears of those whom he so fain would
overtake.</p>

<p>Behind this first boat were three others nearly abreast, all of
them containing soldiers, as well as the first, and all impelled by
both oars and sails, except the last, which was soon recognised by
its peculiar rig to be the pilot-boat, known to be much swifter on
the water than any other belonging to Newcastle, and which
gallantly supported its fame on the present occasion by rapidly
overhauling the foremost of the pursuers.</p>

<p>About five miles ahead, towards the north, in which direction
the steersman held his course, was a point that terminates the bay
into which the river Hunter erupts itself. From this promontory a
number of rocks stretch out nearly a mile into the sea. These crags
can only be seen at low water, or when the fury of tempestuous
waves lashes the billows over them into rude and boisterous
breakers. At other times they lie concealed. The freshness of the
present breeze curled the waters into white and sparkling foam over
and around this reef. The helmsman of the fugitive boat, who
despite the wound that had broken his arm, and even now dropped
blood on the deck at his feet, still maintained. his post, and now
appeared, maugre the danger which was apparent even to the
inexperienced eye of our adventurer, to steer full towards these
breakers, instead &mdash; as Rashleigh thought would be the better
course &mdash; of holding out into the open sea. Ralph ventured to
hint as much to Roberts the helmsman, who only replied with great
calmness that &ldquo;he knew what he was about, and was doing all
for the best&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rashleigh could observe that the pilot-boat had now
overtaken the one which, hitherto foremost, had conveyed the
commandant. The former lay to alongside the other for an instant;
and when she resumed her way, the fugitives could see that dreaded
officer on her forepart.</p>

<p>The breeze continued to freshen the more they got from under the
lee of the land; and the boiling surf upon the sunken rocks was but
a very short distance ahead, when Roberts roared out, &ldquo;Lay
down, every man!&rdquo; setting the example himself by falling flat
on the half-deck, still, however, retaining his hold of the tiller
and keeping his eye fixed on a hill at some distance straight
ahead.</p>

<p>A volley of musketry pealed from the pilot-boat, some of the
bullets tearing through the sail of the fugitive craft; and
instantly afterwards the voice of the commandant, known, alas, too
well to all the runaways, was now heard thundering in imperious
tones, &ldquo;Strike your sail, you infernal scoundrels, and
surrender; or we&rsquo;ll run you down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts raised himself to his knee and gave the tiller to
another man, whose musket he took. Then, after looking carefully to
the flint and priming, he said, &ldquo;Now, my lads, if we were
once inside of that reef we should be safe. There is but one
passage through it, and I believe there is not a man in either of
the boats who knows that course except myself. So if we can, we
must stop the pilot-boat somehow. I&rsquo;ll aim at that damned
tyrant in her bow; and you other men, never mind those on board
her, but fire at the slings of her sails. If any of your shots
tell, they must stop and the devil thank them. So say when
you&rsquo;re ready, my lads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others examined their pieces and levelled them when Roberts
resumed, &ldquo;Now, my boys, the <i>slings</i>, mind
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let fly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reports boomed along the main, and Rashleigh, who was
anxiously observing the effect of their volley, when the smoke
cleared away, saw the commandant stagger. He let his musket fall
with an oath and then sank into the arms of one of the boatmen who
extended them to receive him. The after sail fluttered a moment in
the breeze like a wounded bird and then dropped over the heads of
the steersman and soldiers in the stemsheets. All were in
confusion. The boat yawed quite out of her course in an instant,
and that instant saved her from driving <i>full split</i> upon a
rock that was not an oar&rsquo;s length from her bow.</p>

<p>The boat manned by the runaways now was in the thick of the
breakers that leaped, foamed and dashed on every side of her. There
seemed to be scarcely her own breadth free from danger; but that
narrow inlet lay right ahead. And the vessel answered helm sweetly,
for Roberts, who had thrown his musket on the deck the instant it
was fired, was now steadily guiding her by some well-known token on
the opposite shore. On she flew, like a courser impelled by the
spur, while the surf and spray broke fairly over her from either
side, forming a perfect arch above the heads of the trembling
fugitives, who every instant expected to be whelmed in the ocean,
that seemed, like an insatiate monster, expanding its hungry jaws
to receive them.</p>

<p>This wild commotion of broken waters was not more than a hundred
yards in extent, which space was quickly passed by the gallant
little bark that bore the flying convicts. They were then in
comparative safety. On their left lay the mainland, on their right
was the open sea; but between them and the latter, at about the
distance of a mile, the thundering noise of breakers indicated the
existence of a reef, or barrier of rocks, which is frequently found
to guard the approach to the iron-bound coast of eastern Australia.
Around and in front of the fugitives&rsquo; boat, the water,
through the freshness of the breeze, was slightly rippled on its
surface, but was undisturbed by any wave of magnitude, the fury of
the boundless Pacific Ocean being expended upon the rocks by which
this space was, as it were, girdled in.</p>

<p>Rashleigh had noticed and much admired the cool self-possession
of Roberts their steersman, who amid the dreadful commotion of the
roaring breakers through which they had passed, had not betrayed
the least shadow of fear, but merely kept his lips sternly
compressed and his eye fixed upon the land mark he seemed to be
steering for. Our adventurer, now the danger was passed, could not
help praising the dexterity of his seamanship. Roberts only smiled
and replied, &ldquo;We shall see directly how the <i>sojers</i> get
through it; for look, by George! they are going to try it
on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On turning his head, Ralph could see the sixteen-oared boat
making for the opening in the surf. Impelled by the fresh breeze
and the ardour of her crew, who still pulled unflinchingly at their
oars, she came dashing at the reef like a high-mettled steed at
some opposing barrier. Another instant a wild cry arose from all on
board of her. She was upset. They were engulfed in the roaring
breakers, the crashing noise of her parting planks and the cries of
her crew for assistance being heard far above the din of the
elements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said Roberts. &ldquo;I thought some of
you would cool your courage <i>there</i>!&rdquo; And turning his
back on the sight, he sat down very composedly alongside the
tiller, which he leaned upon with one arm, while he asked another
of his companions to bind up the wound he had so long before
received.</p>

<p>Rashleigh continued to gaze upon the scene of their
pursuers&rsquo; discomfiture, and he had the satisfaction of seeing
that the remaining three boats quickly came up; for he could not
help hoping that none of the crew of the swamped bark would lose
their lives, though he felt at the same time that any of those he
pitied would most probably have either shot or helped to hang
himself with no more remorse than they would feel for the fate of a
dog.</p>

<p>The boats from the settlement were now pulled round the reef and
out into the open sea; but by the time they had reached the latter
they were scarcely visible to the fugitives, who then felt
themselves at leisure to answer those clamorous appeals that hunger
had been making to each for some time past. Luckily there was
abundance of water and provisions in the boat, which they now
ascertained, by questioning the man who had been in charge of her,
was originally equipped in Sydney for the service of two gentlemen
of capital lately arrived from England, and about to settle in the
Colony. They were bound on a voyage up the river Hunter to select
land, and it seemed they had gone on shore at Newcastle to spend
the day and dine with the commandant, when, unluckily for them,
Rashleigh had discovered their little bark, which they had left at
anchor where the officers&rsquo; gig bearing them the invitation
had chanced to overtake their boat on their passage up the
river.</p>

<p>After the first plentiful meal any of the poor wretches had
partaken of for some time had been discussed, they held a
consultation respecting their future proceedings. It was finally
agreed upon that they should run along the coast to the north, as
Rashleigh remembered having read of Captain Bligh and his
boat&rsquo;s crew doing after the famous mutiny of the
<i>Bounty</i>, British man-of-war in the South Seas; and they
doubted not by this means to reach some of the Dutch settlements in
the Indian archipelago, where they hoped to pass for shipwrecked
mariners. They therefore resolved to be as sparing as possible of
their provisions and to eke them out as much as they could with
fish. These views they kept secret from the boat-keeper, whom they
put on the land, giving him directions how to follow the beach
until he arrived at the north shore of the harbour opposite
Newcastle.</p>

<p>The first night of Rashleigh&rsquo;s freedom for several years
passed away very pleasantly. He slept only a short time indeed, but
talked over their plans with the steersman Roberts, who at length
yielded to the entreaties of our adventurer, that he would take
some rest. And the former now resigned to Ralph the guidance of the
boat, directing him to keep her head towards a certain star which
he indicated; but if the wind should alter or fade or any breakers
should be near, all the men were to be instantly aroused.</p>

<p>Rashleigh spent the hours that remained until morning thinking
over the various chances, whether of danger or success, which
appeared to await their enterprise. It was certain, no doubt, that
Captain Bligh and his companions had some years before traversed
much more than twice the distance over the self-same track they
were now pursuing, and had at last safely accomplished their voyage
in an open boat, which was also very indifferently supplied with
water and provisions; while the bark that bore our adventurer was
half-decked, tolerably well stocked with food, to which, as they
discovered a quantity of tackle in the boat, they might add
abundance of fish, which absolutely teemed in the ocean around
them, while, as they need not leave the sight of land, they could
surely obtain a supply of fresh water as often as they required it.
Upon the other hand, the danger was great that they might be
pursued by some armed vessel, for they well knew that one of the
colonial cutters was expected in Newcastle every day, and no doubt
the commandant, who had shown so much personal anxiety to recapture
them, would, if he had survived his wound, dispatch her to run down
the coast as quickly as possible. Then again, it was questionable
whether there was any passage through which the boat could pass
into the open sea from the inlet they were now sailing over; or if
there was, might not the boats of their pursuers intercept them at
it?</p>

<p>Being, however, willing to hope for the best, and conscious that
of himself he could do but little either to help or hasten their
deliverance, our adventurer consoled himself at last by thinking
that they all had at least a chance of escape; and if it should
fail them, still, it was better to die in freedom than to linger
out a miserable existence in that abode of horrors which they had
quitted.</p>

<p>The dawn of day surprised Rashleigh upon his post. A sort of
haze overspread the surface of the deep, and as he had no longer a
beacon by which to steer, it became necessary to arouse Roberts.
The latter speedily came from beneath the half-deck, and looking
around at the shore, where only the summits of distant and lofty
mountains were as yet visible. he exclaimed, &ldquo;We have made a
most capital run. We are beyond my knowledge of the coast, and that
extends at least a hundred miles to the north of
Newcastle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The increasing light soon made them aware that their pursuers in
the pilot-boat, which was the only one that had continued the
chase, were now nearly abreast of them, but still divided by the
distance of nearly a mile and a half beyond the barrier of rocks,
while to add to the discomfiture of the fugitives, the thundering
noise of breakers full in their front gave evidence that they were
approaching the termination of that inlet which had hitherto proved
their safeguard. The breeze also had been gradually dying away, and
it shortly became stark calm, so that they pulled the boat into
shoal water among some mangrove bushes and anchored her there.</p>

<p>They continued anxiously to observe the motions of their enemies
in the pilot-boat, who after some time also took to their oars and
pulled slowly along the exterior of the reef, stopping every now
and then, as if looking for a passage through it. After a brief
consultation, therefore, the convicts, who feared their pursuers
eventually discover some means of reaching them on the water, took
everything out of their boat, carried whole on shore, and buried it
in the sand, above high-water mark. They then filled the little
vessel herself and sank her in a place of concealment, where the
water was not very deep, a manoeuvre that was instigated by our
adventurer, who hoped by this means to puzzle their pursuers very
much, if they did not throw them off the scent altogether.</p>

<p>Each man now taking a small stock of provisions with him, some
ammunition, and their muskets, they penetrated into a dense
thicket, through which they made their way for nearly a mile with
great difficulty, halting at length on the summit of an eminence
that afforded a view of the ocean though not of their pursuers,
who, having got over the reef, were now too close under the shore
to be visible.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">At once there rose so wild a yell<br>
Within that dark and narrow dell,<br>
As all the fiends from heaven that fell<br>
Had pealed the banner-cry of hell.</p>

<p>The party of convicts that had thus so far succeeded in making
their escape from the limeburners consisted of six men beside
Rashleigh and Roberts the steersman, whose courage, and the skill
he had displayed in conducting their boat in safety through the
dangers of the reef, had caused him to be much looked up to by his
comrades, who seemed by general though tacit consent to consider
him as their captain and leader.</p>

<p>Of the others, McClashin was a native of Belfast who had earned
considerable ill will among the convicts because he had, in order
to save his own life, prosecuted to conviction four other men some
time before that had engaged with him in the commission of a
robbery, when his associates in crime had been hanged upon his
evidence.</p>

<p>Phelim Hennessy was from Tipperary, and had been transported for
life to New South Wales in consequence of his having participated
in the popular though anything but humane amusement common in
Ireland at that time, of &ldquo;carding a tithe proctor&rdquo;.
This man used often to boast of his achievements prior to his exile
in the most exulting terms, speaking of the most sanguinary deeds
with a cool gusto that showed the bloodthirsty temperament of the
man. He had been violently suspected since he came to the Colony of
no less thin three murders, and was at length retransported to
Newcastle for a most ruffianly assault upon an overseer.</p>

<p>The remaining four men, whose names were Perkins, Shawl, Hanlan,
and Owens, were remarkable in no way as being either better or
worse than the usual run of convicts. <i>Of course</i>, they were
common thieves, and their knack of illicit appropriation, after
having caused their banishment from their native land, had at
length, upon some fresh offence, conducted them to the Coal river,
from whence to the limeburners the transition was very easy.</p>

<p>Roberts the steersman had been a Nottingham boatman. He was
transported for rioting and demolition of machinery. On his arrival
at Sydney he had been employed in one of the government boats, but
attempting to escape from the Colony, he was retaken and sent to
Newcastle for seven years.</p>

<p>The party continued to watch the ocean from the hill upon which
they had posted themselves, as related in the last chapter, until
evening; and just before it became dark they had the mortification
to see the pilot-boat standing out to sea, towing after it the
little vessel that had borne them in safety thus far, and upon
which they had depended for aiding them to escape altogether from
the Colony.</p>

<p>Some of the men were disposed to raise a violent outcry against
our adventurer, at whose instance the plan of sinking the boat had
been resorted to; but upon his asking them in a cool and
contemptuous tone why they had not proposed some better method of
disposing their vessel when it was spoken of first, they were
silent, except Hennessy, who swore that it had been his opinion all
along the best way would have been to fight a passage out of the
reef, in spite of the soldiers; and even he was calmed on Roberts
observing, &ldquo;If you think we can beat those that are in the
pilot-boat, it&rsquo;s not too late to have a bellyful of fighting
now. Because you may take my word for it, if we go down to the
beach and show ourselves, the redcoats will come back quick enough
to have a slap at us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As even Hennessy, in spite of his boasting, did not quite
approve of this plan, no more was said about the boat, but all
began to deliberate what they had better now do.</p>

<p>McClashin, supported by Hanlan and Hennessy, was for turning
inland to the west until they gained the settled part of
Hunter&rsquo;s river; then, after robbing the settlers about
Wallis&rsquo;s Plains, that they should pursue their route
southwards and join some of the other parties of bushrangers who
were laying waste the country in the neighbourhood of the
Hawkesbury, finishing off by seizing on some vessel from the mouth
of that stream and carrying their original intention of going to
Timor Coupang into effect.</p>

<p>Upon the other hand, our adventurer, who had acquired from past
circumstances an invincible detestation of the life of a
bushranger, impressed upon the minds of his present associates the
great danger they would incur of apprehension by adopting the last
speaker&rsquo;s project; and after dwelling upon the improbability
of all their present party keeping together, even if they survived
the perils of so long a journey, Rashleigh proposed as the more
feasible plan, that they should persevere even now in marching
along the beach, whether the party in the pilot boat had discovered
all their concealed stores or not. But if they found any of the
tools had been left behind, he submitted they might surely be able
to contrive the construction of a double canoe the first cedars
they came to, when they could at once proceed on their voyage to
the northward without beginning, as preparation for it, a journey
of more than five hundred miles, which the course spoken of by
McClashin would subject them to, but which Ralph considered as
outrageously ridiculous.</p>

<p>All the party now wished to hear what Roberts would say, and it
was obvious that he would command the majority of voices in favour
of the plan he might be inclined to pursue.</p>

<p>They did not wait long, for he said, &ldquo;Our way lies north.
And if only <i>one</i> man will go with me, I&rsquo;ll take the
beach for it. But I think those that want to go any other way are
fools for their pains, as they are sure to be grabbed by some means
before they get half the distance that&rsquo;s talked about. No, no
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here we are, so far on our journey. We have the sea
before us, and we can&rsquo;t starve while there&rsquo;s a fish in
it; and besides, I&rsquo;ve heard there&rsquo;s plenty of wrecked
ships along this shore. Who knows but we may make or find a better
boat than the one we&rsquo;ve lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This settled the question, for the men who had not offered any
opinion now sided with their captain and Ralph, so that they were
five to three of those who wished to turn west. And after having in
vain tried to bring Roberts over to their way of thinking,
McClashin and his companions were fain to submit to the majority,
though they did so with a very bad grace.</p>

<p>They reposed on the ground they had occupied during the day,
nearly eaten alive by mosquitoes, which Rashleigh had never before
felt so troublesome since he had been in the Colony; and by dawn
the next morning they were in motion, anxious to see whether
anything had been left of all they had hidden in the sand the day
before.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival at the beach they soon found out that all
except the boat remained <i>in statu quo</i>, although the thicket
was much trampled down; and other indications presented themselves
that the soldiers had instituted a rigorous search in every spot
but the right one near the place where they discovered the boat.
Every man now set himself busily to work to prepare a knapsack and
other conveniences for carrying provisions, etc.; all the food,
their arms, the tools and a couple of sails, with a quantity of
cordage, being equitably apportioned, so that each man bore a fair
proportion of the public burden. The only things they did not carry
with them were the water-cask and a barrel of salted meat, which
they left buried in the sand, being determined if they could
succeed in manufacturing a canoe within any reasonable distance,
they would return to fetch these articles as supplies for their
proposed voyage.</p>

<p>It was noon before they had completed all their preparations, so
they got ready some food. After having eaten this, they departed,
each man bearing a burden, besides his clothes and arms, of nearly
fifty pounds weight, which made their progress necessarily slow.
The nature of their path, too, which lay along the sandy beach,
would have tended to fatigue men much stronger than these emaciated
beings just escaped from an abode of horrors &ldquo;the like of
which no eye bath seen, no heart conceived, and of which no tongue
can adequately tell&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At sunset they had not gained more than six miles towards their
long march, but were much inspirited by seeing on a distant hill, a
very short space inland, what one or two of the men confidently
declared were cedar trees; and they came to a halt, flattering
themselves that perhaps one more day&rsquo;s toil would place them
near this timber, which they now wished most anxiously for in order
that they might try their hands at the proposed experiment of
canoe-making.</p>

<p>Just before they ceased their march, Rashleigh had placed his
burden upon the ground to rearrange it, and ere he completed doing
so to his satisfaction, the others had got a trifling distance
ahead of him. When he was about to reassume his load, chancing to
look into the bush beside the beach, he fancied he saw a native
black. Upon this he gazed more steadfastly, and though the sable
son of nature slunk more deeply into the covert, yet Ralph was
certain of his proximity, and argued no goodwill from him, as he
was so apparently unwilling to be seen.</p>

<p>Roberts, to whom he mentioned this circumstance, fully agreed
with him as to its being a prognostication of danger, and when the
arrangements were made for the night, the party camped in as open a
place as they could select, where no neighbouring thicket might
afford harbourage for a lurking foe. Good fires were also made, and
one of the men agreed to watch for a time, when he was to be
relieved by another, thus maintaining a vigilant guard throughout
the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>Nor were these preparations needless, for long after all the
band of weary fugitives, except their sentinel, were buried in
slumber, the man on watch observed a number of dark bodies
wriggling over the sandy spot that encompassed their temporary
camp, which he at first conceived to be some kind of wild animals;
but on their nearer approach the glare of the fire betrayed their
real forms. They were black warriors, who, with savage treachery
and cunning, hoped thus to surprise the sleeping white men; but the
latter, being awakened by their fortunately vigilant guard, yet
kept themselves still, by desire of Roberts, who, conceiving that
in such cases as this the failure of a first attempt would be
likely utterly to discomfit the savages, directed them all to
&ldquo;lay quiet&rdquo;, only keeping their arms in readiness, and
to await his signal for firing all at once, which was to be the
single word &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The savages, meanwhile, had approached, in their own broken
English mode of expression, &ldquo;murry close up&rdquo;, when all
at once they halted and remained motionless on their faces, save
one, who crawled a little nearer to the white men&rsquo;s camp.
Then, raising himself partially, he uttered a single guttural
monosyllable, apparently as a token to the others that the objects
of their attack were asleep; for his sooty companions, the instant
after he spoke, recommenced their sinuous, crawling mode of
advance, and when they had got to the burdens which each of the
fugitives had borne during the day, and which now lay disposed in a
circle around the white men, the sable warriors yelled
simultaneously and leaped on their feet with a cry which awakened
the erewhile slumbering echoes of that lone and silent beach.</p>

<p>At this instant Roberts gave the promised word. The flashes of
his companions&rsquo; musketry and the loud cheering hurra that
accompanied their discharge completely amazed the assailants,
several of whom fell by the bullets of this volley; while the
remainder, exchanging their barbarous note of attack for cries of
surprise and affright, bounded off into the forest with the speed
of their own native emblem, the fleet kangaroo. The blacks who had
fallen, too much wounded to follow their example, rent the air with
exclamations of pain, until Hennessy rushed upon them and battered
out their brains with repeated blows from the stock of his
musket.</p>

<p>To sleep any more during this night was of course impossible, so
the fugitives sat up and passed the remaining hours of it in
watching the numerous torches which, after the repulse of their
sable antagonists, had appeared to illuminate the neighbouring
bush, but the bearers of which took great care to keep at a
respectful distance from the dreaded muskets of the white men.
Towards morning the moon rose, and Roberts, with another man,
scratched some holes in the sand where the advancing tide would
cover them and placed the dead bodies of the fallen blacks in these
rude places of sepulture, because he knew that the sight of their
slaughtered companions would be sure to excite the wildest passions
of revengeful fury in the breasts of their black enemies.</p>

<p>When daylight appeared there was no vestige of any foe to be
seen around them, and the band of runaways enjoyed their morning
meal in peace. They then resumed their toilsome march, which still
lay along the sea-beach, and had gone about two miles from the
scene of the attempted surprise when their path led them beneath
some lofty cliffs that nearly overhung the shore. Rashleigh, who
now chanced to be among the first of the party, proposed to the
others that somebody should ascend the nearest high rock and look
out in order to ascertain whether their intended line of road was
clear from enemies, as he much misdoubted, from the tales he had
heard of aboriginal cunning, that the blacks might be concealed in,
or near, these cliffs with a design of attacking them as they
should pass beneath.</p>

<p>This advice, however, was overruled by the majority, who seemed
to think that one of the men showing himself in so conspicuous a
position would most probably invite their sable foes to attack him
at least, when he might be killed before his companions could come
to his rescue. They therefore continued their march, only keeping
as near the water&rsquo;s edge as possible, by which means they
were generally out of the reach of any ordinary native weapons. For
the space of nearly half a mile they went on unmolested. Here the
cliffs receded a little, but returned to the very brink of the
ocean about a quarter of a mile farther along, the intermediate
little bay being thickly strewn with rocks. The last man of the
fugitive party had scarcely passed the point entering on this spot
when the discordant yell of the native warriors was heard from
every part of it and a host of armed blacks was seen by the
terrified runaways, among whom a volley of spears was thrown by
their cunning foes, who the instant they had discharged their
weapons threw themselves down behind the rocky lurking-places that
had at first concealed them.</p>

<p>The prevailing feeling among the little band of white men on
this sudden attack, made when they had begun to deem the peril of
the place had been passed, was undoubtedly one of fear, and those
who were unwounded turned to fly by the same road they had
approached this fatal spot. But this was no longer in their power.
A strong party of blacks had seized that outlet, and brandishing
their weapons, seemed to defy the white men, daring them to the
attempt.</p>

<p>Roberts had fallen with a spear through his leg. Hanlan also had
been struck down by a waddy. But the former now arose and breaking
off the spear point that protruded behind him, dragged the
remaining portion of the weapon out of his flesh, calling Out,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my lads, we&rsquo;ll beat the black
vagabonds yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a musket had yet been fired on the side of the white men,
and perhaps this made their enemies fear to rise for the purpose of
discharging any more spears.</p>

<p>Not far from where Roberts then was there stood a flat-topped
rock about eight feet above the level of the beach. On this, in
spite of his wound, did this brave fellow clamber and surveyed the
spot around. When he had marked all the places of danger in their
route, he came down again and proposed to his companions that they
should fight their way through the blacks to a part where a ledge
of rocks overhung considerably, beneath which, he suggested, they
would be safe from all attacks save those made from the front. This
being agreed to, the wounded man Hanlan was supported by another
and placed in the centre. The others, four in front and three
behind, began to move slowly towards the appointed place, keeping
their weapons ready for instant service, and the last three walking
backwards.</p>

<p>They had gone but a short distance when they discovered a party
of about twenty blacks that lay concealed in the bed of a small
torrent, and who consequently were unseen by the white men until
the latter, in making for their proposed post, arrived at the brink
of the declivity which crossed their way. Nor were the savages
aware of the approach of their foes. But the instant the cry of one
of their number gave the alarm, all his companions, starting up to
their feet with a dreadful yell, rushed furiously at the fugitives,
who had scarcely time to take aim when the blacks, nothing daunted
by the fall of six of their number, were mixed among them, every
man grappling with at least one enemy, fighting hand to hand for
dear life.</p>

<p>The white man&rsquo;s superior stamina at length prevailed. The
butt ends of their heavy muskets proved much more effective weapons
than the waddies of their sable antagonists, who, maugre their
numbers, began to give way, thus affording time to the runaways for
reloading their fire-arms, one discharge of which completely
dispersed their wavering foes, who fled pell-mell to the nearest
shelter of rocks, leaving thirteen of their number on the field,
while of the whites, two were put <i>hors de combat</i>, namely
Shaw, who was quite dead, and Hanlan, who in addition to the wound
he had before received, had a severe contusion on the head. But
now, taking advantage of the terror inspired by the late defeat of
the onslaught made by the savages, the white men were enabled to
gain the place of comparative security proposed by Roberts. Here
they were permitted to take breath only for a short time before the
blacks, working themselves into a paroxysm of fury at the sight of
their slain companions, rushed among them like so many mad demons.
The volley of musketry that was discharged with fearful effect into
the thick of their advancing body only caused them to waver for an
instant; but speedily recovering from this slight panic, they
leaped upon the white men, and another arduous struggle ensued.</p>

<p>The fugitives, now reduced to six capable of exerting
themselves, placed their backs against the rocky cliff and defended
themselves with the butt ends of their guns. Rashleigh was soon
busily engaged protecting himself against the attacks of four stout
blackfellows, who appeared to be resolved on immolating him. Having
heard that the legs of an aboriginal warrior are his most
vulnerable part, he confined his blows to those limbs of his
adversaries and had brought two of them down, when having in
striking the last stepped a pace forward from the rock, he was
seized round the body by another, who, lifting him up in his arms,
was carrying him out of the throng; when our adventurer, whose
hands were at liberty, dropping his musket, opened his pocket-knife
and stabbed the other repeatedly until he fell, his loud and
frequent yells for help being unheeded by his brethren, who were
each and all too busy to lend him any aid.</p>

<p>To catch up his relinquished musket and rush at the backs of
some of their sable opponents, who had got Roberts down, was but
the work of a moment to Ralph, who plied his weapon so vigorously
that his endangered companion was soon enabled to rise and give his
assistance in repulsing the foe, who, now wearied with their long
continued exertion, once more gave way. And finally, seeing that
Roberts and Rashleigh were reloading their muskets, those of the
blacks who were able to do so ran without stopping out of sight,
leaving to the white men the possession of their rude fortress,
which had cost them so dear to defend, Rashleigh being the only one
of the fugitives that was left unwounded, while three of his
companions were dead outright.</p>

<p>Nor had the aborigines effected this slaughter with impunity.
Twenty-two of their body lay around, few of whom were killed,
however, until Hennessy, the instant that he saw their assailants
retreating, began to mangle the wounded wretches with his
clasp-knife, as it seemed to our adventurer, needlessly prolonging
their torture, until the latter and Roberts commiserated them, and
put an end to their sufferings.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">In broken dreams the image rose<br>
Of varied perils, pains, and woes.<br>
They come, in dim procession led,<br>
The cold, the faithless, and the dead;<br>
As warm each hand, each brow as gay,<br>
As if they parted yesterday.</p>

<p>The condition of the fugitives in their rude fortress was
sufficiently dispiriting, after the first joy that they felt for
their victory had passed away. Three of their number lay dead; and
all the rest, save Rashleigh, were more or less wounded, as before
related. Besides these causes for regret, they knew that the
blacks, though repulsed for a time, would most certainly renew
their attack with the first convenient opportunity and never cease
to harass them until they had either revenged the fall of their
fellows or shared their bloody graves. The spot in which they were
also afforded no water, and it would have been perfectly impossible
for some of the white men, who had suffered most in their late
conflict, to remove to any more promising place, even if they had
not feared danger by the way from the assaults of their insidious
enemies.</p>

<p>McClashin, who was almost uninjured, and Hennessy, who was only
slightly so, were now violent in their clamours against our
adventurer, accusing him of being the origin of all their mishaps,
since they had adopted his advice of continuing the route along the
beach. It was in vain that Rashleigh alleged the fact that they
would have been equally liable to the attacks of the aborigines in
whatever direction they had proceeded. The others only became more
clamorous; and Hennessy at length got so much enraged that, taking
an opportunity while Ralph was looking another way, he presented
his musket at the former. Roberts, whose wounds had by this time
become so stiff that he could not rise, was only able to warn the
intended victim of the other&rsquo;s murderous design in a hurried
manner.</p>

<p>On turning his head, Rashleigh saw the rascal taking aim at
himself and rushed upon him. Fortunately the gun missed fire; and
our adventurer, whose passions were fully aroused at the treachery
of the attempt, wrested the musket out of Hennessy&rsquo;s hand,
then, throwing it away, seized upon his foe and lifting him up by
main strength, dashed him to the ground, the craven ruffian roaring
out all the while for mercy; which Ralph, thinking the fall might
be a sufficient lesson to him, now granted and resumed his seat
beside Roberts, who was rapidly sinking from loss of blood, he
having received four spear wounds in different parts, besides many
contusions.</p>

<p>It was Rashleigh&rsquo;s care in the first place to withdraw the
weapons, portions of which still remained in the wounds of his
suffering companion. He then bandaged them up as well as he could
and laid the wounded man in a nook where he might take some
undisturbed repose. After this he cautiously crept out of their
fastness, with his musket loaded, to reconnoitre the neighbourhood
for water and to observe whether any of their late opponents were
visible. Not one of the latter was to be seen, nor could our
adventurer for a long period discover any of the former object of
his search. At length, in a spot at the foot of a clef, in the
precipice, he found some aquatic-looking plants, around which the
soil seemed moist. Here he scratched a hole with a stick, and in a
few moments had the happiness to observe the orifice filling with a
fluid that examination soon assured him was good fresh water, a
small supply of which he took in a quart pot to the cave, having
first enlarged the little well to the capacity of a bucket.</p>

<p>The water was eagerly welcomed by Roberts; and the other wounded
men were equally clamorous for a drink. But as a few minutes must
elapse before any quantity could be collected, they were forced to
wait, and in the mean time Ralph employed himself in dragging away
the dead bodies that cumbered the floor of their retreat. These he
put in a hole beside a huge rock at some distance, covering them
with sand as well as his imperfect means would allow. The next
operation he engaged in was the construction of a sort of hedge, or
<i>chevaux de frise</i>, with the ropes they had brought, which he
tied across a narrow part of their retreat, securing the ends to
stakes wedged into fissures of the rock and interlacing the whole
with thorny boughs, so that it might serve to prevent any sudden
hostile attack and keep off their foes while they reloaded their
muskets, which, as Ralph had discovered, was very essential from
the circumstances attending the last onslaught of their sable
enemies.</p>

<p>Our adventurer next procured a sufficient supply of fresh water
and prepared some food, of which, however, neither Roberts nor
Owens was able to partake. They were the principal objects of his
solicitude, as the conduct of neither McClashin nor Hennessy had
been such as much to endear them to him. But nevertheless, though
they had not assisted him in any of his exertions, he invited them
to share the meal, which they did very willingly, appearing to be
quite friendly and reconciled, though once or twice our adventurer
detected sinister glances passing from one to another of them,
which he neither understood nor approved of, and therefore, after
having attended to the wants of the wounded, he left the cavern in
search of some secret nook to which he might repair after it became
dark.</p>

<p>At some short distance from their place of retreat was an
upright fissure in a rock, which had been filled with seaweed by
the action of repeated storms. The upper part of this was now dry,
and Rashleigh resolved on making it his lair for the night that was
now fast approaching. Intending, however, to give one more look at
his companion Roberts and to smoke a pipe beside him as he lay, he
turned back for this purpose, taking with him a large armful of
seaweed to form an addition to the couch of the wounded man.</p>

<p>Just before he reached their place of refuge he heard voices
conversing together in a subdued, almost whispering manner. A
little attention to the tones satisfied him they were those of
McClashin and Hennessy, and willing to hear what the subject might
be they were discussing in this stealthy manner, our adventurer
noiselessly put down his burden and crept very cautiously behind a
rock they were seated in front of, talking so earnestly that they
had not observed his approach.</p>

<p>Ralph heard Hennessy say, &ldquo;I tell you he&rsquo;s as strong
as a bullock and might be more than a match for the pair of
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McClashin rephed, &ldquo;Well thin, we must do the other thing,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; And they rose from their seats, going away
towards their companions.</p>

<p>The few words he had thus heard set Rashleigh thinking what
might be their import; but he could not satisfy himself upon this
score, though, coupling the glances he had seen exchanged between
these men with this circumstance, he feared they intended treachery
to himself. Thus put in some degree upon his guard, he entered the
cavern very warily and looked round for the two conspirators, whom
he saw sitting by the fireside, chatting together in a very
unconcerned manner.</p>

<p>McClashin observed, &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got something to
make a bed. Is there any more of it anywhere handy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty on the beach,&rdquo; briefly replied Rashleigh.
And the other two rose and went out, as Hennessy said, &ldquo;to
gather something to lay upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they were gone, our adventurer&rsquo;s first act was to
take out the flints from their muskets, after which he made up a
bed for Roberts and then concealed all the other fire-arms but the
piece he carried himself. When this was done he prepared his pipe
and lay down to smoke in silence beside his wounded companions, who
went to sleep almost directly he had replaced them on their rude
couches. McClashin and Hennessy soon returned, and the former
observed they had now a good way of passing the night.</p>

<p>Our adventurer did not make any reply, and the other went on
addressing him, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rason you don&rsquo;t speak
to a body? Sure you an&rsquo;t crabbed at us because you had them
few words wid us to-day, are you? You shouldn&rsquo;t mind me or
Hennessy, for we are only a couple of foolish wild Irishmin, you
must know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hennessy here laughed and swore, &ldquo;By Jakus, thin,
<i>I&rsquo;m</i> foolish enough, anyway, for I&rsquo;d quarrel wid
my best frind sometimes; but id&rsquo;s all over wid me in a
minnit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh did not put much confidence in the pretended
friendship of either, but still thought it best to suppress the
answer that was rising to his lips. So he only said that he
wasn&rsquo;t at all angry, but only tired and sleepy, on which
McClashin remarked, &ldquo;Faix, thin, and no wondher, afther the
hullaballoo we&rsquo;ve all been in to-day. By my sowl thin, I seen
you shtick that big black divil that was hauling you off like a
horse&rsquo;s head to a bonfire. <i>That</i> was <i>nately</i> done
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And thin, how you rattled the others about the
shkulls that was pegging away at poor Roberts. I <i>will</i> say if
you hadn&rsquo;t come back to help us, he&rsquo;d a bin dead now,
anyway. And musha, God knows, the whole of us, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a catlike, treacherous, whining way about this man
that he ever assumed towards those whom he most deeply hated, and
Rashleigh had observed it often before, so that all his specious
talk made no further impression upon the mind of our exile than
warning him against some meditated deed of stealthy violence. So,
finding himself really about to sleep, he got up and stole out of
the place, taking the greatest precaution against being either
followed or observed. In this way he reached his proposed lair and
nestling in among the seaweed, slept unmolested until morning.</p>

<p>Soon after daylight he re-entered the rude shelter, where he
found all things undisturbed and the inmates fast asleep behind the
defence he had erected. While he was preparing their morning meal,
McClashin awoke, and observing Rashleigh to be busied in his
occupation, he arose and proffered to assist him. Hennessy also got
up and our adventurer thought there was an air of hesitation about
this bold-faced ruffian that did not become the assumed heartiness
of his manner as he bade Ralph a good morrow. In the course of
their meal McClashin asked the latter how he had slept and being
answered very well, he added that he also slept wen, &ldquo;only
the muskatees were very throublesome&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This day passed over quietly, and towards nightfall McClashin
and Rashleigh went out to fish while Hennessy promised to keep a
strict look-out for the blacks.</p>

<p>The two anglers met with very good success and brought home as
much finny spoil as promised to afford them all two abundant meals.
After supper Rashleigh lay down beside Roberts as before, until it
was dark, when he repaired to his separate sleeping-place, where he
again disposed himself for slumber, but in vain for a very long
period, and he imagined that he was not sufficiently tired to sleep
quickly. At length the drowsy god shed his poppies over the
eye-lids of our exile, who sank into a state of troubled
repose.</p>

<p>His rest was broken by a series of singular dreams. First his
vagrant fancy strayed to the home of his youth. He was playing with
his only sister, when a little childish quarrel arose and she was
suddenly transformed into a hideous spectre, whose demoniac
features still bore a faint resemblance to those of the departed
bushranger Philip Foxley, who, grinning horribly, appeared about to
strangle the solitary sleeper. Then again, he fancied himself to be
an inmate of Marshall&rsquo;s cottage, paying courtship to his
quondam fellow-traveller Jane Bates; and she was smiling at his
suit as the door suddenly opened, when McClashin, with Hennessy for
his compartion, rushed in, who shot the poor girl dead and were
dragging him out when he awoke to feel a sensation of some
undefinable dread overhanging his mind, which he could by no means
dispel so as to sleep again.</p>

<p>At last the fear of some unknown and horrible impending calamity
became so poignant that Rashleigh could endure it no longer, and
hastily getting up, he went towards the place of his
comrades&rsquo; repose. On arriving within sight of the opening,
the first thing that attracted his attention was the ruddy glow of
some hasty fire that emanated from it, which, casting its glare
around, illumined every object for many yards. His instant idea was
that the blacks had surprised his sleeping companions, and having
set fire to the hedge he had put up, were perhaps waiting until the
white men came out in confusion to spear them at their leisure.</p>

<p>Full of this dreadful thought, he cocked his piece and stepped
stealthily towards the spot, where he saw McClashin stooping down,
adding some light wood to the fire, while Hennessy was apparently
looking for someone in the corner where Rashleigh had at first lain
down.</p>

<p>Who was the object of this search quickly became apparent, for
the ruffian making it uttered a loud oath, and said, &ldquo;That
beggar Ralph is not any place here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind <i>him</i> now!&rdquo; replied
McClashin. &ldquo;We can give it to him as he comes back. Settle
the other two at <i>once</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time our adventurer had got quite close to Hennessy, who
stooped over Owens. A stifled sort of shriek and a blood-stained
knife that gleamed in the murderer&rsquo;s hand as he rose told
what his base deed had been. At this instant his eye caught that of
Rashleigh, whose finger was on the trigger of the musket, the
muzzle of which was not a yard from the detected cut-throat&rsquo;s
head. He uttered an indescribable sort of howl as Ralph shouted,
&ldquo;Die, dog!&rdquo; And the musket answering well to his words,
the brains of the cold-blooded ruffianly assassin spattered full in
the face of his accomplice McClashin, who, Pot yet seeing their
intended victim, had come to the assistance of Hennessy, but
dismayed by his sudden fall, offered no effectual opposition to our
adventurer, who smote him to the earth with his musket.</p>

<p>Such was the force of the blow dealt that no second repetition
of it was necessary. The defeated plotter sank to the earth, and
the short-lived flame raised by his hand expiring at the same
instant, our exile was left alone, as he believed, and in darkness
with four inanimate corpses that had within the last few seconds
been violently reft of life, two of them by his own deed.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood appalled; but at length collecting some
scattered fragments, he again awoke the slumbering embers of the
decayed fire, by the light of which he surveyed the scene and
quickly found, to his great joy, that Roberts yet survived, not
having been touched by Hennessy, whose purpose appeared to have
been first to kill Rashleigh, and it seemed to be only when he
could not find the primary object of his heartless design that he
had resolved on ridding himself of their wounded comrades.</p>

<p>This idea was confirmed by McClashin, who did not die until near
morning, though the roof of his head was completely crushed in.
Before his departure, with every mark of penitence for this as well
as many other crimes, he confessed to Rashleigh that himself and
Hennessy had resolved on killing all three of their surviving
companions, then to cut off their heads as well as the heads of
those who had fallen and were buried. They proposed to take these
bloody trophies back to Newcastle, where they intended to give
themselves up to the commandant, telling him a specious tale to the
effect that they (McClashin and Hennessy) having been pressed by
the others and compelled against their wills to join in the seizure
of the boat, had watched the opportunity as soon as they could
acquire fire-arms by stealth from the fugitives, and killed them
all. For this act of barbarous treachery they hoped to obtain their
freedom, as many other equally execrable deeds had been similarly
rewarded before; but the whole plan had been opportunely defeated,
as we have seen, through the restlessness of one of its proposed
victims.</p>

<p>For several days after this scene of detected treachery, the two
surviving fugitives remained in their retreat unmolested; and at
length Roberts, having acquired sufficient strength to walk,
yielded to the urgent entreaties of Rashleigh, who ardently longed
to quit a place where even the air they breathed appeared to be
polluted by deeds of slaughter and violence.</p>

<p>Having therefore concealed the greater portion of their tools,
arms and other appurtenances by burying them in the sand, the
runaways recommenced their toilsome march, carrying with them two
muskets, an axe and a cross-cut saw, with a small supply of
provisions, intending still to persevere in their now almost
hopeless design of penetrating to the cedar trees before spoken of
and attempting to construct a canoe of that timber.</p>

<p>Roberts, however, was still so feeble and weak that although the
distance could not have been more than twenty miles, yet they were
three days in reaching the scene of their proposed operations.</p>

<p>The long sought for trees grew upon an island about four miles
from the bottom of a bay, in the course of a broad and rapid river,
which fell over a ledge of rocks at the end of the island nearest
the ocean. The current was exceedingly rapid, and our adventurers
could not for some time devise means of passing it. At length
Rashleigh remembered the method adopted by Foxley in crossing the
Nepean, and after some rime succeeded in constructing a catamaran
near a bend in the river a good distance above the islet in
question. This rude raft was formed only of logs lashed together
with wild vines, but having tested its powers of endurance, Ralph
did not doubt its answering their purpose, and Roberts, without
hesitation, committed himself upon it to the water, accompanied by
our adventurer, who had provided himself with a pole to guide their
crazy vessel. Fortunately the bed of the stream was here very
shallow, so that when they got out into the current our exile was
enabled to bear strongly upon his pole, keeping the head of his
raft in the proper direction, and in a few minutes they safely
reached the haven of their hopes.</p>

<p>The island upon which they had landed was very small, deeply
fringed with brushwood that grew down to the water&rsquo;s edge.
But the centre was a hill of considerable height, on which the
trees grew that were the object of their ambition to reach, without
any other kind of timber near them. These cedars were of very great
size, and Rashleigh began to fear that even when his companion
should be sufficiently recovered to attempt it, their saw would be
found inadequate in length to cut down even the least, in which
case they would be compelled to resort to the tedious process of
chopping it through with the axe.</p>

<p>In the first place, the delicate state of Roberts&rsquo;s health
rendered it necessary that some shelter from the weather should be
provided; and Rashleigh, anxious for employment to dissipate the
unpleasant reminiscences occasioned by their past mischances, set
himself so industriously to work that in three days he had
completed a very passable hut, the sides of which were wattled with
boughs and plastered with mud, while the roof was thatched with
reeds.</p>

<p>Deeming this to be a place of security, our exile next
determined to pay a visit to their former retreat under the rock,
as he now discovered they were likely to want several other matters
for the construction of a canoe which lay there, in particular some
cordage; and having now acquired a little knowledge of the stream
on which their island stood, he feared not to wade it. This he did
shortly after daylight one morning, leaving his comrade in their
little cot, well supplied with all he could be likely to require,
and strictly enjoining him on no account to leave the hut, lest he
should be seen by any of their sable foes from the shore.</p>

<p>As Ralph was encumbered with nothing but his gun, he ran the
greater part of the way to the scene of their late conflict, nor
did he see a single living being on his route. But on approaching
the bay, he first perceived a dense smoke arising from the
neighbourhood of their former fortress; and having ascended a tree
on a slight eminence, he saw that a large number of blacks occupied
the beach in front of it, who were apparently intent on the
performance of some religious or perhaps funereal solemnity. As our
adventurer had often heard that these savages do not like to remain
for a long period near a place where any of their tribes have met
with violent deaths, he concluded the best plan he could adopt was
to wait patiently until the sooty warriors should withdraw; but he
almost repented of this determination as hour after hour went by
and they still appeared to have some fresh ceremony or new dance to
perform.</p>

<p>The sun was very low before the blacks left the spot free to the
researches of our adventurer, and on descending he found that they
had indeed been performing some most revolting rites. The sable
warriors that had fallen throughout the affray with the white men
had apparently all been disinhumed and brought hither to be
reinterred, a spot above the influence of the highest tides having
been selected. Graves, or rather pits &mdash; as the aborigines
always bury their dead either erect or sitting down, and not
extended &mdash; had been dug, the number of which described a rude
circle. The blacks who had been slain appeared here to have been
buried. A post set up in the centre bore the heads of all the
fallen white men, severed from their bodies and hung here by the
jaws, while all of their teeth had been knocked out and carried
off. On every one of the graves also lay some part of a white
man&rsquo;s corpse, other portions of which were strewn about in
all directions, so that it appeared these revengeful savages had
wreaked that vengeance upon the dead which they had been prevented
from doing to the living.</p>

<p>Rashleigh stood a few moments an appalled spectator of this
disgusting golgotha; but at last he resolved the savages should not
be able to revisit that spot on the morrow to point to the
senseless remains in proof of what they had done to avenge the
aggressions of the white men. So, disgusting and repugnant as was
the task, he collected all the mangled relics of his slain
companions, and fearing no other method could secure them from
further desecration, he piled them all together with a huge
quantity of brushwood, which he at length set fire to, being well
aware he need fear no interruption from the aborigines, whom no
earthly considerations could induce to approach the grave of any of
their recent dead after nightfall.</p>

<p>When this melancholy duty was fulfilled, he repaired to their
former hiding-placc under the rock, where he found the articles
they had concealed were still unmolested. From these he selected as
much as he could carry and departed, using every exertion to arrive
at the island before daylight; but it was long after sunrise when
he did so, and found Roberts, as he had expected, much alarmed on
his account.</p>

<p>When the wounded man had in a great measure recovered from his
injuries, both our fugitives set themselves strenuously to work and
by dint of arduous exertion in the short space of one day had not
only felled a stout cedar but had cut a portion of the butt off and
stripped it of its bark. There was fortunately a considerable
hollow in this naturally, which, of course, promised to diminish
their labour most materially. The plan they proposed to adopt,
therefore, was to split a part of the butt off, to deepen the
hollow by means of fire, rudely to shape the head, stopping up the
orifice in that part by the means of gum, used instead of pitch by
the aborigines. To this log they proposed to attach another, and
connecting both parts together, thus to form a double canoe similar
to those in use among the Sandwich islanders, which it is well
known can scarcely be upset.</p>

<p>For several days, growing at length into weeks, they toiled
unremittingly, and at length had the heartfelt joy of seeing both
the parts of their canoe safely launched into the water, while the
rude balks they intended for the connecting frame lay ready for
joining on the bank. This inspired them with so much additional
vigour that they wrought harder than ever, scarcely taking time
either to eat or sleep, because they employed themselves on their
vessel all day, and at night, by the gleam of their fire, prepared
their cordage, sails and oars.</p>

<p>The river had been several days getting lower than it was when
first they arrived on the island; but Roberts, to whom Rashleigh
had that morning remarked this circumstance, only replied,
&ldquo;Never mind, mate. If there&rsquo;s only water enough left to
carry us over the fall, there&rsquo;s sure to be plenty in the
sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weather, too, was unusually oppressive; yet though it was so
hot, the sun was obscured by a yellow haze, while all nature seemed
completely hushed into a state of unnatural stillness. About four
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the same day, as both our
fugitives were working on the raft, our exile conceived he felt a
tremulous motion that seemed to be communicated from the land
against which one side of their vessel lay. Just after, a moaning
rushing noise, far more terrifying to him than the loudest clap of
thunder, seemed to issue from the neighbouring mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that dreadful noise, Roberts?&rdquo; asked
Ralph, looking wildly at his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only distant thunder,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder!&rdquo; repeated Rashleigh, gazing round at the
sky. &ldquo;And not a cloud to be seen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this instant his eye rested upon the bend of the river just
above him, and who shall attempt to analyze or describe his
feelings when he saw sweeping down towards them, silently save for
that moaning noise which he <i>now</i> too well understood, a
mighty mountain of rushing waters, that stretched from bank to bank
of the stream, and whose height seen from the level at which the
fugitives stood was equal to that of the loftiest tree of the
forest!</p>

<p>Short was the time permitted him to gaze upon this awful sight.
Before Rashleigh could communicate his alarm to his companion, the
vast volume of water was upon them like a destroying angel. Roberts
was torn from the canoe, which, bursting its fastenings as though
they were threads, was hurled over the falls in an instant. The
crash of its parting timbers announced its destruction; and
Rashleigh became insensible.</p>

free-born man,<br>
When wild in woods the noble savage ran.</p>

<p>When our adventurer was restored to sense he found himself lying
upon an arid beach, surrounded by a great number of aborigines, who
seemed to have been using some kind of means for his resuscitation.
The instant that their patient gave indication of returning life a
quarrel arose among them, the object of which, so far as Rashleigh
could divine it, seemed to be which should drag the white man off
with him. And they were obviously about to appeal to the issue of
arms to decide this contest when one of their number came up, whose
arrival changed the whole course of action.</p>

<p>The black who now approached was one of the most revolting
specimens of humanity that can possibly be conceived. A very few
white hairs only remained upon his polished skull, forming a thin
circle around it. His beard, however, was more luxuriant than
usually falls to the lot of any Australian aboriginal. One of his
organs of vision had been utterly extinguished, leaving in its room
only a raw and bloody cavity. His other eye appeared to be more
than half obscured by rheum. His body was emaciated by sickness
until it scarcely possessed more substance than a shadow.</p>

<p>Add to the above that he was gashed and scarred all over, but
particularly about the face, also that, though last not least among
a race supereminent for uncleanliness, he appeared even more
conspicuous for personal filth than any of his fellows, and you may
conceive some idea of the unattractive appearance of this old
black, for whom, notwithstanding, every facility was afforded by
his compeers, who withdrew from around their prostrate prisoner,
for whose possession they had been only an instant before
quarrelling with the utmost excess of savage fury. And they
permitted the senior to approach Rashleigh, who, upon his part, had
been long expecting to receive the <i>coup de grace</i> among them,
deeming it highly probable, amid the furious contention which had
so long prevailed, that somebody, enraged at a repulse, might end
the dispute by dashing out his brains with one of the clubs or
<i>nullah nullahs</i> that were brandished so angrily upon all
sides.</p>

<p>The scene was now entirely changed; all became so still and
hushed around that the falling of a single leaf might with ease
have been heard. The savages, as if surprised, suspended their
weapons in the air in the midst of the explanatory, argumentative
or threatening flourishes with which they had been erewhile
assisting their oratory; and every man retaining the same posture
he had occupied on the occurrence of this interruption to their
unknown purpose, all eyes were now bent upon the decrepit
savage.</p>

<p>Our adventurer, in the course of his rambles in New South Wales,
had not omitted to satisfy his curiosity by enquiring of all whom
he thought competent to afford information upon the various manners
and customs of the nomadic races of Australia, and during the
period of his investigations had received particular accounts of
the personal appearance of, as well as the singular power and
influence possessed by, the <i>carandjies</i>, even over the very
wildest and most untamed tribes that had yet been heard of in the
Colony. Among these rude bodies they appear to combine the
characters of doctor, priest, magician and chief ruler. From the
peculiarity of the marks made upon the parti-coloured personage who
now drew nigh, as well as the great deference paid to him by the
others, Rashleigh had no doubt but that this old savage was a
<i>carandjie</i> of great eminence among his people.</p>

<p>The ancient black supported his tottering and feeble steps upon
the rough limb of a tree. In his right hand he bore a green
eucalyptus bough. Advancing to the white prisoner, he motioned with
his hand, and all the other blacks fell back to a little distance,
crowding together in a circle. The <i>carandjie</i> tottered
several times round Rashleigh, waving his bough and chanting a kind
of dull monotonous song, which seemed to our exile only a
repetition of two or three words. At length he ceased to sing and
sat down at the head of the captive, who silently watched his every
motion. The old blackfellow next made a kind of speech, which was
attentively listened to by the others, whose demeanour was
perfectly altered and now appeared to be as pacific as a few
moments before they had seemed animated by the wildest fury. A kind
of guttural grunt hailed the termination of the
<i>carandjie</i>&rsquo;s harangue, who thereupon walked two or
three more times round Rashleigh, waving his bough and chanting as
before.</p>

<p>Two athletic black men now approached, who gently lifted Ralph
from the ground and placed him on his feet, making signs that he
should walk with them. Knowing the folly and inutility of
resistance, our adventurer passively complied, and partly led,
partly supported by his guides, reached the camp of the tribe,
which, it being now fine weather, was in a piece of open forest
land, and consisted of nothing more than a considerable number of
little fires, beside each of which lay or sat the <i>gin</i> (wife)
and dogs of the blackfellow to whom they belonged, watching, as it
seemed, the <i>dilleys</i> (nets) that contained their fishing
tackle and such weapons as the warrior did not carry with him.
Rashleigh and his guards were guided to a resting-place by the
decrepit old <i>carandjie</i>, who owned three fires, and of
course, according to custom, three <i>gins</i> also; for no matter
how many wives a blackfellow may have, each maintains her separate
fire, and each provides a portion of food for her lord and master.
Indeed, the latter always dispatches the former by the dawn of
every day to fish, hunt for cockles and grubs, or to dig up swamp
roots, according as either may be the usual kind of food for the
season.</p>

<p>When the women depart, the men, in the mean time, unless
urgently pressed by hunger, still lie asleep or lounge about the
fires, making or repairing their weapons for war or of the chase
until the return of their partners, when each man goes to his
<i>gin</i>, or he who is rich enough to have two or more, visits
them all, taking the lion&rsquo;s share of what they may have
brought, and rewarding them by caresses and praises for diligence,
or punishing them by blows for the reverse, according as their
researches have been successful or otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, either in peace or in war, the <i>gins</i> of the
aborigines in this part of Australia, at the time these incidents
occurred, were no better than slaves to their men, who repaid them
with the most haughty and imperious usage for all their exertions,
and only left them the refuse of the provisions which they
themselves had made to satisfy hunger. The male savages confined
their labours to hunting the kangaroo or the opossum, which the
women on no account were permitted to touch until they were
presented with such portions as the men thought fit. Sometimes,
too, the latter would go and spear fish; but this they did chiefly
by way of amusement, as if it were beneath their dignity to follow
it as a pursuit.</p>

<p>Rashleigh had been placed on the ground near the old
<i>carandjie</i>&rsquo;s fire, and in a short time one of the
<i>gins</i> supplied his guards with a quantity of cordage,
apparently spun from filaments of bark. His hands were bound fast
to his side and his feet tied together, so that he could not stir
by any exertion of his own, after which the warriors withdrew,
leaving our adventurer alone with the ancient <i>carandjie</i> and
his <i>gin</i>. The former now came and sat very close to his head
again and continued to chatter without any intermission, using many
extraordinary gesticulations; but not one word, of course, of all
that he said was intelligible to our exile.</p>

<p>By and by another <i>gin</i> approached, bearing a few fern
leaves in her hand, on which lay a large fish, apparently fresh
roasted. A few words passed between herself and the old black,
after which she placed Rashleigh in a sitting posture and began to
tear the fish to pieces with her fingers, feeding the prisoner with
these morsels, which, though rather insipid for want of salt, were
yet very welcome after so many hours of abstinence. A draught of
water from a calabash finished this novel repast, and Ralph was
then replaced in his former recumbent position by his black
mistress or attendant, for she might he either for aught he knew;
and she lastly covered him with an opossum-skin cloak, directing
him, still making use of signs, to go to sleep, which, in spite of
his anxiety, he did in a short time.</p>

<p>When he again awoke it was night. No sound save the hoarse
croaking of the frogs in a neighbouring swamp disturbed the
silence; but the uneasiness of his position prevented any further
sleep. At the dawning the <i>gins</i> all departed as usual. A very
short time afterwards Rashleigh&rsquo;s bonds were loosened, and he
was motioned by one of the warriors to rise. He did so and
perceived that the whole of the males belonging to the tribe were
assembled close at hand, each being fully equipped as for war and
most frightfully smeared with different earths, yellow, white and
red being the predominant colours.</p>

<p>A sort of procession was now formed, the ancient
<i>carandjie</i> leading the way, supported by two athletic men
fully armed. These were followed by a body of about a dozen, who
bore nothing in their hands but green boughs, which they waved to
and fro, chanting in a low tone a formula of a few indistinct
monosyllables. Behind these came the prisoner, walking between two
other stout men, who, like the foremost, were equipped with spear,
shield and waddy, having their hair most fancifully decorated by
red and blue feathers, mixed with tufts of cotton grass. Large
bones were also thrust through their ears and the cartilage of
their noses. After these came more men with boughs, and the rear
was brought up by the body of armed warriors attached to this
tribe, of whom, in all, not less than 150 were present.</p>

<p>They walked on slowly until they arrived at a small open green
space from which the sea was visible. It was not yet sunrise, but
the eastern sky had begun to glow with the approaching presence of
that glorious luminary. Nearly in the centre of the little plain
was a sort of mount, apparently raised by art at some distant
period and now covered over with grass. On this mound Rashleigh was
placed in a sitting posture. The warriors then ranged themselves
behind and on each side of him as he sat facing the sea. Those
blacks who had borne the green boughs stuck them in their girdles
behind them with the leaves pointing downwards like so many tails.
They next began to jump about in a rude sort of dance, imitating,
as it seemed, the motions of a kangaroo.</p>

<p>In the mean time the <i>carandjie</i> drew near our adventurer
and placed on the ground before him a bundle tied up in a kind of
cloth made of opossum skins dressed with the hair on. Then, taking
a bough, he proceeded to wave it to and fro in a mysterious manner
over the parcel, chanting or muttering all the time. At length he
opened it with great caution, and Rashleigh now perceived that it
contained a number of human teeth, all of them single, or such as
grow in the front of the jaw. Beside these the packet enclosed an
instrument made of green talc, bearing an imperfect resemblance to
a chisel, and a flat, irregularly-shaped stone of considerable
size.</p>

<p>At a motion from the old black, Rashleigh&rsquo;s arms were
secured by two of the bystanders, and the <i>carandjie</i> put on
such an indescribably demoniac look that our exile now quite gave
himself up for lost. His race was not yet run, however, for the
ancient black magician, taking the implements of stone in his hand,
approached, speaking very earnestly and pointing to the features of
the others, making signs as if he wished the prisoner to open his
mouth. Rashleigh at last complied with the direction, and the old
man placed the chisel against one of his single teeth, looking
round to the ocean as he did so. An instant after this the sun
began to peer above the waves; and at the first glimpse of his body
a smart tap on the chisel from the stone forced out the tooth, the
patient&rsquo;s head having been supported behind by, one of his
guards.</p>

<p>A loud shout accompanied this operation, and the tooth was
shortly afterwards handed round to each man present, all of whom,
as Rashleigh observed, made a motion to spit upon it. It was at
last restored to the <i>carandjie</i>, who placed it carefully
among the others, tying up the parcel with great ceremony. A dance,
called by the colonists a <i>corroboree</i>, now took place, in
which only the unarmed men joined. It was, however, attended by
much shouting and clashing of weapons among their armed brethren.
At the conclusion of this dance Rashleigh was seized by his guards,
who had before relaxed their grasp of him, and he was now laid on
his face, being prevented from moving by numerous hands. Directly
afterwards he felt several gashes inflicted on his back, and surely
believing his end had now arrived, he resigned himself to his fate
with as much composure as he could assume, and being almost
indurated to torture by the cats of the Coal river, he did not
betray by a groan any susceptibility to pain.</p>

<p>He was quickly turned over on the bleeding parts, and he now
observed that each of the dancers bore a small sharp shell
crimsoned with his blood. which flowed freely around. The
operators, or as Ralph thought then, tormentors, now stooped
towards him, their eyes glaring furiously on their victim. Again he
felt the stabs, and a loud yell pealed around him. He was almost
instantly raised from his recumbent position, when he found he had
received no less than thirty-six deep cuts, regularly placed,
before and behind him, in four rows of nine each, from his
shoulders to the bottom of his ribs, but none lower than this.
These gashes were, of course, now all streaming with gore, of which
he also felt the warm current trickling down his back and legs.
Another dance succeeded, after which the <i>carandjie</i> once more
drew nigh with a shell full of some clammy styptic preparation,
with which he anointed all the wounds, and they almost instantly
ceased bleeding.</p>

<p>Rashleigh was then placed upon some boughs forming a sort of
litter, which being hoisted upon the shoulders of four
blackfellows, they returned to the camp in much the same order as
they had left it, except that all the blacks made a great noise
with shouting and beating their waddies against their shields,
parties of them dancing along at times like so many mad furies.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the camp, the <i>gins</i> were all
reassembled, busily roasting fish, roots and grubs, in short,
apparently making preparations for a great feast. Two of their
number were pounding some condiment between stones, which they
afterwards put into a large calabash.</p>

<p>The men now squatted in a wide circle on the ground, the
<i>carandjie</i> being placed next to Rashleigh; and directly
afterwards the females presented to each some broiled roots and
fish, also, by way of <i>bon bons</i>, a few of those large grubs
that are found in rotten timber, which were now nicely roasted. The
ancient black ate but very little himself, continually passing all
that was handed to him over to our exile, who thought matters now
began to look a little better. Still, the latter did not fancy the
appearance of any of the food save the fish, which, though broiled
without any kind of cleansing, just as they came out of the ocean,
and eaten without salt, were nevertheless very good.</p>

<p>At various times during this repast calabashes full of some hot,
moderately sweet drink were handed round to the festive group by
their humble attendants, who were not allowed to sit down with them
or to join in this rude revelry, but who, as soon as the men ceased
eating, disappeared; nor did Rashleigh see anything more of a
single <i>gin</i> during the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>To borrow a polite phrase, &ldquo;after the ladies had
retired&rdquo;, the calabash before mentioned, which contained the
pounded root, was put into requisition, being presented to the
<i>carandjie</i>, and he divided its contents into a great many
portions, which were put in other and smaller, calabashes or gourd
skins, and the vessels having been filled up with water from a pond
close by, their united contents were made to boil by having red-hot
stones placed in them. The liquor was dipped out of these goblets
with shells and eagerly drunk by the assembled blacks. Our exile
partook of it and found it to have a taste something similar to
fermented Spanish liquorice, but with a certain pungent acridity
which it imparted to the palate after it had been swallowed. This
drink speedily intoxicated the whole group. They danced, fought,
sung and shouted away for several hours; and when at length
Rashleigh was able to wrap himself in his opossum-skin cloak for
the purpose of going to sleep, there was not one of his sable
companions sensible. They all lay strewn about, completely dead
drunk.</p>

<p>The next day our adventurer found himself very unwell, with all
the symptoms of an overnight debauch, though he had drunk very
little of this ardent mixture. But all the blacks really appeared
more dead than alive. The old <i>carandjie</i>, in particular, lay
like one in a torpor, and during the whole day he reposed with his
head in the lap of his favourite <i>gin</i>, who ever and anon
supplied him with some kind of cooling drink.</p>

<p>In a few days our exile&rsquo;s wounds began to cicatrize; but
over each gash a wavy sort of scar remained, of a very singular
appearance and nearly as large in projection from the skin as his
middle finger. One morning the old black doctor presented him with
a dark-coloured kind of pigment with which he made signs for
Rashleigh to anoint his skin. On compliance with this request the
parts touched by the composition quickly assumed the tinge of rusty
iron; and on repeating the application daily for about a fortnight,
the whole of his body, save the palms of his hands and the soles of
his feet, was changed into a dull dark-brown hue. A ball of suet
was next given to him to rub over his person. This appeared to
deepen and even to fix the colour so much that Ralph Rashleigh,
though naturally of a ruddy complexion, now really differed but
little in colour from any of the sable sons of the forest among
whom his lot appeared to be cast, especially after the latter, who
were generally grimed with grease, filth and soot, had been
bathing, which they frequently did in the summer season, either for
pleasure or from necessity while following the chase.</p>

<p>The ancient black, who seemed to have adopted our adventurer,
next presented him with a <i>gin</i> and gave him a good store of
native weapons; but they still continued to eat together and always
slept at a short distance from each other. One of the black
warriors also, at the old <i>carandjie&rsquo;s</i> request, now
commenced initiating the new-comer into the mysteries of savage
life, teaching Rashleigh the various modes of hunting, spearing
fish, etc. Our exile, who feared that if he should return among his
own countrymen his lot might be even worse than it was at present,
applied himself to his instructions with great goodwill and soon
became tolerably proficient in most of the simple arts of the
aborigines, though nature and habit had denied to him the unerring
eye and keen perception which are so common among them but appear
never to be granted to any save savages. As he remained in this
state of willing barbarism upwards of four years, it would be
useless to attempt following his proceedings minutely during that
period; but by giving a sketch of his mode of passing one day, an
idea may be obtained of all the rest.</p>

<p>In the morning then, while Lorra his <i>gin</i> went out to dig
roots, Rashleigh would go and hunt for bandicoots or kangaroo rats.
if he met with a goanna or an opossum, he would follow him up any
lofty tree, cutting notches in the bark with his stone tomahawk to
enable him to ascend it. When at last the object of his chase got
upon a bough that would not bear the pursuer, the latter, by
cutting the limb through, would precipitate his prey to the ground,
which seldom failed either to kill or very much to maim it. If, on
the other hand, the animal or reptile took shelter in a hollow
part, the <i>white</i> blackfellow would dig him out of his
retreat, if he could not haul him from thence with a forked stick.
In either case, he descended leisurely to the ground after
accomplishing his purpose, secure of an ample breakfast.</p>

<p>If any of his dogs &mdash; of whom he bad a host, all of them
either of the native breed domesticated or descended from such
&mdash; pursued any of the smaller ground animals such as a
bandicoot or a kangaroo rat until it took shelter in a log, the
pack would stand baying and yelping around it until Ralph came up,
either to cut into the hollow tree, or sometimes, if this seemed to
be a hard task, to plug up the orifice and set fire to the other
end of the log, certain that when he returned in an hour or two to
reopen the hole, the animal would either be found dead close to it,
or if living, would be forced by the heat to run out among the
dogs, who never failed then to catch him.</p>

<p>After he had by any of these means secured sufficient food, he
returned to the camp, having soon learned by unerring natural signs
how to direct his steps so as to attain any wished-for point
through the densest an most trackless parts of the wild Australian
bush. In the camp Lorra would by this time have the fern roots
washed, scraped and boiled or roasted, and some of the other gins
would be provided with fish. Whatever our adventurer had obtained
would now be added to the stock, all of which was prepared with
more attention to cleanliness than usually obtains in aboriginal
cookery. And when the repast was ready, the whole group of three
gins, Rashleigh and the old <i>carandjie</i> sat down and shared
alike. After this they reposed until evening in some shady spot,
when fresh roots and fish or game being provided, they partook of
another meal, seldom taking more than two daily.</p>

<p>At times Rashleigh and some of the blacks would go at night with
their gins to a secluded bay or inlet not exposed to the fury of
the open sea, the gins bearing large lighted torches made of
resinous bark, and the males provided with fishing spears having
four points slightly separated at the extremity. The whole party
would wade up to their middles among the shallows, and the fish
attracted by the glare would come swimming up around them quite
close to their feet, where, dazzled and confounded, they fell an
easy prey to their pursuers, who, thrusting them through with their
weapons, cast them out upon the beach until they became
fatigued.</p>

<p>In the winter season, when much of the undergrowth, such as
vines, etc., that tend to render the scrubs inaccessible, had lost
their leaves, so as to render a passage through such thickets
possible to men and dogs, as well as opening the view into these at
other seasons impenetrable fastnesses of the animal creation, the
warriors of the tribe, appointing some detached place of this kind
for a centre, would disperse themselves, forming a very wide circle
of several miles in extent, having their dogs secured with leashes
and held close. They would then advance towards the rendezvous,
yelling and beating their more sonorous implements of the chase,
blowing upon conch shells and in fact making as much noise as they
could contrive.</p>

<p>The object of this was to make all the wild animals fly before
them towards the middle, while the blacks kept on slowly advancing
until night-fall. They then encamped, and one slept while another
watched throughout the hours of darkness. At dawn they were again
in motion until the scrub or thicket which formed their centre was
full in sight, at which time the black warriors would be ranged in
a close circular line around it, no person being perhaps more than
six yards from another. Then some of the most expert, with all the
dogs they could muster, beat the thicket, forcing the whole of the
thus enclosed animals that could not ascend trees to fly out of
their covert, when the M&Ecirc;L&Eacute;E began, and the
surrounding blacks slaughtered the kangaroos, bandicoots, etc.,
with their spears and waddies, after which, the game being carried
home, a great feast ensued, lasting as long as the spoil they had
taken would serve the assembled multitude for food, during which
the liquor made from roots before mentioned, and a preparation of
honey were drunk in great profusion, until serious quarrels
invariably occurred, ending in furious fights, during which
grievous wounds were freely given and received.</p>

<p>After some time Rashleigh acquired a competent knowledge of
their lariguage &mdash; if their mode of expression could deserve
to be dignified with such a name &mdash; which he described as
being, like all else belonging to them, very inartificial and rude.
In fact, they had no more words than were absolutely necessary to
communicate one with the other on the few and simple subjects their
mode of life rendered usual.</p>

<p>Of religion they had none whatever but many very ridiculous
superstitions of supernatural appearances, chiefly relating to
ghosts of slain warriors, transformed into cruel and malignant
demons, continually endeavouring to kill the women and children or
even the grown warriors if they could catch the latter asleep or
unarmed. Many places were shunned with the wildest fear by these
timorous creatures because they were supposed to be the haunt of
these cowardly goblins, who, as it seemed, played their pranks by
day as well as by night, in the former case terrifying the unlucky
beings who saw them by their supernaturally demoniac forms, which
required truly wild imaginations even to conceive. Nor would any
temptation whatever induce them, when once they were lain down for
the night, to remove from their fires even for the purpose of
gathering a few sticks, though the flame should happen to be
expiring, which took place the more frequently because they never
would light a large log that might maintain them in warmth for a
few hours, though such as these, consisting of huge trees uprooted
by storms or age, lay around them in dozens; but owing to some
ill-defined usage, derived also from superstition, they would only
make use of boughs for this purpose not larger than a man&rsquo;s
wrist.</p>

<p>Their government, if such it may be called, was a species of
patriarchal despotism. In the tribe to which our exile was so long
attached, all the visible power was vested in the hands of the old
<i>carandjie</i>, who appeared to have derived it from his eminence
in feats of war during his youth; and he now maintained it by his
dexterity in imposing himself upon his ignorant countrymen for a
very great conjuror, since he had become decrepit. Of his power in
this art, Rashleigh observed the following instance.</p>

<p>Lorra, who by the by had been the ancient
<i>carandjie</i>&rsquo;s favourite <i>gin</i> before our adventurer
was taken captive, one day made a complaint to the former that
Tumba, a powerful black, had beaten her because she had quarrelled
with one of his wives while the two females were digging roots
together. The old magician, having heard this plaintive tale,
wrought himself up to a pitch of fury, and ordering Tumba into his
presence, abused him with the most bitter virulence, which the
other, so far from resenting, endured with the greatest humility,
attempting to exculpate himself by throwing the whole blame of the
quarrel upon Lorra, who, he said, had irritated him by her scolding
tongue.</p>

<p>This defence by no means appeased the old man, who at last bade
the culprit, &ldquo;Begone and <i>wither</i>.&rdquo; Now, upon
enquiring from Lorra, Rashleigh found this meant to pine away and
die; and the poor credulous <i>gin</i> added that several of the
men who had before received this sentence had actually been taken
sick, and two or three of them were dead, those who recovered, she
added, only having done so because the old man had granted them his
forgiveness. The credulity of the <i>gin</i> almost surprised the
white man, but he afterwards saw enough to convince him that she
had spoken the truth; because the old fellow, who, it must be
remembered was doctor as well as magician-general to the tribe,
always found some means of administering deleterious drugs by
stealth to his enemies, which baneful potions, if not sufficiently
strong to cause death, were at least potent enough to produce a
painful and languishing sickness.</p>

<p>On this occasion Tumba no sooner heard the fatal sentence passed
than he gave way to the wildest demonstrations of grief, tearing
off all the fastenings which secured, and the feathers that
decorated, his hair, so that it fell down over his back in confused
disorder. He also cut severe gashes in many parts of his body,
giving vent all the time to loud lamentations, in which
demonstrations of grief he was joined by his two gins, who
supplicated the old <i>carandjie</i> in vain for mercy. At length
the suppliants withdrew in despair, and they appeared for about a
week to be shunned by the whole tribe of blacks, every individual
of which seemed to keep aloof from them as if they had been
troubled with some infectious disorder. Tumba, during this period,
lay about dejected and spiritless, while his gins endeavoured in
vain to console him; but the placable Lorra never ceased to
petition the old <i>carandjie</i> for a pardon in their behalf,
until he granted it and was rewarded for it next day by the hind
quarter of a most magnificent old man kangaroo, sent him as a
present on this auspicious occasion by the heartily frightened
object of his ban.</p>

<p>Very grave offences, such as murder or theft of a <i>gin</i> by
one of the same tribe, are punished by a verdict of the general
council consisting of all the warriors belonging to the sept, who,
according to the nature of the case, sentence the offender to have
a certain number of spears thrown at him; and on the day appointed
for the execution of the award, just before sunrise, at which
moment most of their ceremonies commence, all the warriors are
assembled at the spot where our adventurer was, according to the
aboriginal phrase, &ldquo;made into a man&rdquo;; such being the
introductory usage to which each male is subject after he attains
the age of puberty, in order to entitle him to assume the weapons
and fulfil the duties of a grown warrior in these savage
communities.</p>

<p>The tribe being thus assembled, the accused black, quite naked
and unarmed save for the defensive weapon of a shield, is placed
standing upon the mound before described. At a distance of seventy
paces, the nearest relative of the deceased or aggrieved person
waits the instant of the sun&rsquo;s appearance above the horizon,
when he throws the first spear at the culprit, who on his part uses
as much dexterity to ward the weapon with his shield as the
assailant exhibits in endeavouring to pierce him. After this party
has thrown his one, two or three spears, according to the decision
of the council, he withdraws, and every man in the tribe discharges
a similar number of weapons at the condemned, on the conclusion of
which the punishment is ended. And whether the prisoner die or
escape with life, his offence is never again permitted to be spoken
of. Such is the dexterity acquired by the blacks in the use of
their shields, which are no more than from eight inches to a foot
at the farthest in width, that Rashleigh knew several instances of
criminals, after having had more than three hundred spears thrown
at them one by one, who only received four or five wounds. and
these all beneath their belts.</p>

<p>In very rare cases, when the crimes are considered unusually
atrocious, the culprits are sentenced to receive twenty-one spears
thrown at them <i>at</i> <i>once</i>. When this occurs, it is
looked upon as equivalent to a certain doom of death, for should
there be only two or three of the assailants revengefully inclined,
the culprit is sure to be transfixed in a vital part, as almost any
grown black can throw a spear with sufficient accuracy to strike a
small bird at a distance of a hundred paces, and with force enough
to penetrate the depth of four inches into the solid wood of a
tree.</p>

<p>These aborigines have no marriage ceremony whatever. When a
youth has undergone, his initiation and is declared to be a
<i>man</i>, the first use he makes of the weapons he has prepared
is to go upon a sort of foray to hunt for a wife. With this view he
steals cautiously towards some swamp, near which he has lain in
wait all night in readiness for this enterprise at day dawn, and
from among the young gins belonging to another tribe, whom he thus
surprises while searching for food, he selects one to his mind whom
he perceives by her head-dress to be unmarried. Her he instantly
pounces upon and bears off by force, maugre her struggles or the
outcries of her companions. If he can succeed in conveying her
safely to his camp before any of her male relatives can rescue her,
she becomes his bride, never afterwards being owned by her own
tribe, who will not even allow her to approach them.</p>

<p>The young gins, who seem to consider it a point of honour to
offer as much resistance to this customary kind of abduction as
they can, do not fail to bite, kick and scratch their captors as
furiously as possible in their transit, which the latter retaliates
by blows upon the female&rsquo;s head, of force nearly enough to
stagger a horse, for should any of them alight upon a leg or an arm
it invariably breaks the limb; and thus, by the time they reach the
camp the <i>bride</i> is <i>at least</i> insensible and the
<i>bridegroom</i> streaming with blood from the effects of this
truly savage <i>courtship</i>, to which there is no exception save
in cases of black men like the <i>carandjie</i> so often spoken of,
who, being too decrepit and feeble to <i>man a gin</i> for
themselves in this manner, are obliged to depute the duty to
others, of whom there are always many willing enough to oblige
persons of their supposed supernatural power; and besides, this
sort of affair is considered a very creditable exploit.</p>

<p>The death of a warrior, especially in his youth or prime, is
regarded as a serious calamity by the whole tribe, who upon such
occasions testify their grief by cutting great gashes on various
parts of their bodies and by loud lamentations. The death of a
chief or of a <i>carandjie</i> is attended by many superstitious
observances; but that of a woman, or <i>gin</i>, is totally
disregarded, as also is that of children of a tender age or of
youths not made into men. But in any case, the name of the deceased
must never again be spoken by the tribe, and they bury the whole of
their dead, the men of ordinary rank in a <i>sitting</i> posture,
great chiefs <i>standing erect</i>, women and children lying on
their faces, heaping a mound of earth upon either, generally of an
oval shape, neatly pressed down and sometimes planted over with an
aromatic kind of small shrub.</p>

<p class="note">A sweet but solitary beam,<br>
An emanation from above,<br>
Glimmers o&rsquo;er life&rsquo;s uncertain dream.<br>
We hail that ray, and call it &mdash; Love.</p>

<p>The aborigines of Australia erect no dwellings of any kind. In
wet weather or when a storm appears to be approaching they strip a
few sheets of some kind of bark, which they rear up on the side
towards the wind, supporting them by a sort of ridge-pole placed on
two forked sticks driven into the earth. On the lee side of this
they light their fire and then, creeping under the bark, lie both
warm and dry enough, never seeking or wishing for any better
habitation, as appears from the fact that those blacks who haunt
the sea-coast, at any rate, might always find caverns and places
sheltered by overhanging cliffs sufficient to lodge them most
comfortably, but will not make any use of them whatever.</p>

<p>Whether it was owing to the previous seasoning Rashleigh had
received in his life of hardship, or to the robust nature of his
constitution, this rude mode of life, so different from any led by
white men, even of the most abject poverty, did not do him the
least injury; and our adventurer, recollecting the sufferings he
had lately undergone, felt tolerably at ease even in the life of a
savage. And knowing that he might expect death if he should fall
again into the hands of his countrymen, he prepared to end his days
with the blacks.</p>

<p>But about four years and a half after Rashleigh&rsquo;s
captivity, the ancient <i>carandjie</i>, his foster-father, died.
He had been gradually getting more and more decrepit until for some
time prior to his decease he had sunk into such a state of absolute
torpor that his breathing could scarcely be discerned. During his
last illness the whole tribe were most unremitting in their
attentions, offering him portions of everything they procured as
food; and when at length it became certain that he had ceased to
exist such a peal of cries and yells of lamentations burst from all
present, warriors as well as gins, as Rashleigh had never deemed
possible for human throats to utter. He was somewhat shocked at one
portion of the proceedings that followed, however; for a lusty
black, who was ambitious of filling in the tribe the place that the
deceased had so long occupied, now threw himself at full length
upon the inanimate remains and applied his mouth to the dead
man&rsquo;s lips, appearing to inhale something very strongly for
several moments. Shortly after this one of the gins, suddenly and
as if by stealth, cut an incision with a sharp-pointed stone into
<i>gin</i>, from which she hastily drew forth the kidneys, and
throwing them upon the breast of the corpse, ran off, several of
the other gins pursuing her, with loud cries and bitter reproaches,
for a short distance; but all this seemed to be assumed anger, as
the <i>gin</i> who had performed this operation returned in a few
moments to the others, whom she mixed with, and they took no angry
notice of her.</p>

<p>In the mean time the <i>carandjie</i>-elect took up the kidneys
and very quickly stripped them of the small portion of shrivelled
and yellow fat that disease had left appertaining to them. They
were then replaced in the dead man&rsquo;s intestines, the orifice
being sewn up by Lorra with a length of kangaroo sinew and one of
their bone needles. <i>Gin</i> was now rubbed all over with gum of
the same kind as that which the blacks use instead of pitch for
their canoes or weapons, and the head was decorated with
parti-coloured feathers, stuck on the skull with the same adhesive
material. After this the corpse was wrapped up in a new rug, or
cloak, made of opossum skins, the fur being inside and the part
that was exposed fancifully daubed with rude designs in coloured
earths. A kind of stage or rude table being formed of green boughs,
the deceased was laid upon it, a great number of little fires being
made at a short distance upon every side in two rows, between which
walked four warriors without arms, but bearing green boughs that
they continued to wave over and around the body, at times running a
few feet as if in pursuit of some imaginary object, and chanting a
monotonous doleful sound. These watchers, or mourners, were
occasionally relieved by others, who followed their example in all
things; and this ceremonial was continued until the funeral, which
was fixed for the next morning, as usual, at sunrise.</p>

<p>Several of the men now departed with the wooden paddles used by
the gins, for the purpose of digging the grave. All that night the
tribe were in commotion. None lay down to sleep. Nor was anything
to be eaten until the conclusion of the obsequies from the death of
the <i>carandjie</i>; but the fires being well maintained, some
parties occasionally yelled forth their wild lament, while others
danced or leaped, as it were in accompaniment to these rude sounds.
The sable sextons having returned at dawn of day to announce that
the grave was prepared, as soon as it became light the whole tribe
were assembled. They were all unarmed, but frightfully smeared over
their whole bodies with colours, of which white and red
predominated; and all carried in one hand a shell, and in the other
a green bough.</p>

<p>The body was now raised upon the stage, which was borne along by
eight blacks, and Rashleigh could not help remarking as a singular
coincidence that <i>they</i> also carry their dead feet first to
the grave, which evidently was not accidental, as the corpse
originally lay reversed; but the bearers, on taking it up, went
round backwards until they had at length attained the proper
position.</p>

<p>The instant that the march commenced, all the assembly, even the
gins aNd children, began to cut, or at least to scratch, themselves
with the shells they carried; and before they reached the grave the
greater part of them were streaming with gore, as they seemed to
vie with each other in the eagerness with which they inflicted
these wounds in testimonial of their grief for the loss the tribe
had sustained.</p>

<p>When the melancholy cavalcade arrived at their burial-place,
which, like their council ground, commanded a view of the sea,
Rashleigh perceived that it was a tract of open land very lightly
timbered. The graves all appeared to be made near some tree, and
there were several round a few of the largest. But what struck him
as curious was that he had not observed the place before, though he
must have passed either through it or at least very near it, and
the more so because upon the nearest tree to each grave a portion
of bark about two feet high and one foot wide had been removed,
leaving the bare white trunk, on which the rude figure of a
kangaroo, bandicoot, snake or bird of some kind had been carved,
those trees that lay near more graves than one having a
considerable portion of their rind stripped off and a corresponding
number of emblems cut upon them.</p>

<p>The body was now laid upon the ground and a green bough placed
in the right hand of the inanimate <i>carandjie</i>, which was
drawn across his breast. Then every individual of the tribe, man,
woman and child, walked round the corpse, making, as it seemed, a
farewell obeisance to the departed ruler, repeating as they did so
their wailings and gashes of sorrow. The pit, or grave, was about
five feet square and eight feet deep. in its bottom four stout
stakes had been set upright, and two poles leaned after the manner
of skids on one side. When all the tribe had passed in review, the
corpse was rested on the upper part of the skids, being held there
by Rashleigh and the new <i>carandjie</i>. Exactly at sunrise they
let go the arms of the body, which then slid gently down into its
final resting-place. Sheets of bark were now fixed inside the
upright stakes, the corpse being placed on its feet within the
latter, leaning against one of the sides with its face turned
towards the ocean; and many paddles being employed, the loose earth
was quickly thrown in between the bark and the bank, which was
trodden heavily in until it reached the level of the dead
man&rsquo;s head. All his customary weapons were now placed in the
square pit that encompassed him, and it was covered up with another
piece of bark, so that the corpse was, as it were, enclosed in a
sort of cavity formed of the thick outer coat of the eucalyptus
tree, which did not permit the earth to touch, much less to press
it. A sufficient quantity of soil was now thrown on and over the
whole so as to form a neat mound nearly three feet in height, which
was beaten smooth with their paddles; and the whole ceremony was
completed by the rude figure of a fish-hawk carved on the nearest
tree, that being the emblem apparently suggested by the name of the
deceased, which might be translated &ldquo;the swooping
warrior&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Ralph Rashleigh viewed this whole ceremony with much the same
degree of melancholy feelings that are apt to impress themselves on
the minds of men when they are bereaved of some such humble friend
as a dog or horse they value; for in spite of the service rendered
to him by the old <i>carandjie</i>, who doubtless had saved his
life, yet the form of this disgusting specimen of antiquity was so
very revolting that our exile had much ado to consider him as being
at all human. And yet it was no very long time before Rashleigh
found that in him he had sustained the loss of a most powerful
friend, who had hitherto controlled the savage humours of the males
belonging to the tribe, who of themselves would have been now ready
enough to mark their hatred of one every way so much superior to
any of them by treacherously depriving him of life, if they could
have divested themselves of the superstitious belief that haunted
their minds, of the spirit of the departed <i>carandjie</i> being
ever watchful and ready to avenge any injury which might be
inflicted on his adopted white son.</p>

<p>A month had not elapsed from the funeral before these
impressions seemed to be weakened, for Rashleigh was one day
informed by the new chief, Terrawelo, that he must either resign
the dead man&rsquo;s two <i>gins</i> to <i>him</i> or fight for
liberty to retain them. Now our exile had no desire to keep all
three of the females; but the latter, having been treated very well
by him, dreaded the idea of going to any of the blacks. Besides,
the manner of the claimant indicated a kind of contemptuous
superiority which Ralph had no notion of, seeing that he well knew
his own muscular strength was greater than that of any warrior in
the tribe. In fact, he had in sport wrestled with two of them at
once, whom he overcame without much difficulty, because, though
they look large in many instances, yet the aborigines of Australia
are physically very weak.</p>

<p>Rashleigh told the chief at once that he intended to fight,
according to the usage of these savages, which prescribes that if a
man have two or more wives, any other who proves himself to be
stronger or more expert at the use of their weapons than he may
take all his gins away from him but one. The answer given by
Terrawelo to this intimation was an attempted blow from his nullah
nullah at Ralph&rsquo;s head; but the latter, having been carefully
watching the eyes of his opponent, dodged the threatened part on
one side, and then, thrusting his head between Terrawelo&rsquo;s
legs, by that means threw the chief violently over his back to the
ground; then, snatching up his fallen weapon, dealt the prostrate
warrior such a blow that on its alighting on the black&rsquo;s arm,
which was held up to save his head, the limb was broken. Rashleigh
was about to repeat tile stroke, but recovering from his fit of
passion, he threw away the waddy and called out for the wounded
man&rsquo;s <i>gin</i> to help him away. Tumba here came up, and
saying something about the chief being killed, attempted to secure
the white man, who, after telling him in vain to keep off, struck
him senseless to the earth and then went quietly away to his own
fire, where neither Tumba nor the chief thought fit to molest him
any more during the day, though ever after this all the blacks
appeared both to fear and hate him. His gins dared not go with the
others to fish or dig roots, because the latter never failed to
beat them. In fact, the whole tribe seemed not only to shun but
also to be bent upon playing all kinds of malevolent tricks towards
him and them when they could do so with secrecy.</p>

<p>One night, about a week after this occurrence, Lorra appeared to
be unusually silent and depressed. Prior to this period she used to
be fond of chattering, generally enquiring about the manners,
customs and dresses of white women, not one of whom she had ever
seen, and she vented many childish exclamations of surprise at
Rashleigh&rsquo;s account of the costumes of ladies in his country
as well as at the manner in which they passed their lives. Upon
this evening, however, she scarcely spoke, but often glanced
fearfully around. Ralph enquired what ailed her, but her only reply
was a mute caress. At length they lay down side by side and our
exile quickly went to sleep, but in a short time, as it appeared to
him, was awakened by a piercing cry from his <i>gin</i>. On
starting up, he found Lorra struggling with her old enemy Tumba. He
was about to rush to her assistance, but she cried out, &ldquo;Look
behind you, Yaff; never mind Lorra.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he turned his head he saw the chief Terrawelo, who, it
seems, taught by former experience to dread the white man&rsquo;s
strength, feared to come too close and was now shipping, or fixing,
his second spear in his <i>woomera</i>, having already discharged
one at his enemy, who, however, did not give him time to throw, for
drawing the spent spear out of the earth in which it stood
quivering, he rushed upon the black and pierced him in the abdomen
with it, thrusting the weapon clean through his body and out beside
his spine.</p>

<p>The cries of Lorra, which had hitherto been most terrific, were
now subsiding into low moans; and Rashleigh, looking round, saw
that Tumba was beating her, as she lay on the earth, with a nullah
nullah which had a knob at its end, weighing at least ten pounds.
Rashleigh stooped not to pick up a weapon, though many lay around,
but darted at the cowardly miscreant, leaping as he got close so
that his two feet alit in the centre of his opponent&rsquo;s back,
whom they of course drove head first to the ground, his club flying
out of his hand as he fell. With a single blow of this, Ralph
crushed the blackfellow&rsquo;s skull into a shapeless mass and
hastened to raise up the poor <i>gin</i>, who had just sufficient
life remaining to endeavour to caress him before she breathed her
last.</p>

<p>Our exile was so much enraged at this piteous sight that he
absolutely became transported with fury; and seizing the club that
still lay embedded in the brains of Tumba, who had not stirred from
the moment he received the blow, Ralph now rushed like a raging
maniac upon Terrawelo, who was by this time surrounded by his
friends, who were deliberating on the propriety of withdrawing the
spear from his wounds. But Rashleigh, unheeding a piercing cry from
the fallen chief, at one blow of his heavy weapon dashed out his
brains. Then, turning upon a warrior who had endeavoured to oppose
his intention, he felled him also to the earth; nor was it until
two others had shared the same fate that the enraged white
man&rsquo;s weapon, striking against the impending bough of a tree,
hampered his exertions so that he was at length disarmed and
secured.</p>

<p>Next morning he was brought as a prisoner for trial before the
assembled tribe, the dead bodies of Terrawelo and Tumba being also
laid before them, surrounded by their wailing gins and connexions.
Rashleigh was asked why he had killed the two warriors.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;There were three dead bodies last night. Why are
there but two this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the warriors leaped up in a fury and cried, &ldquo;The
white man means, brothers, where is the body of his <i>gin</i>, as
if he meant to say he had killed our chief and Tumba to revenge her
death. Let my black brothers teach the pale stranger that they do
not so far worship weak women as to hold that her fate could be any
excuse for the fall of two brave warriors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph then rejoined, &ldquo;It is true. I killed Tumba and
Terrawelo because they killed Lorra; but they had also tried to
kill myself, which they would have done had not the poor <i>gin</i>
lost her life to save mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His opponent shouted scornfully, &ldquo;You had better cry for
your <i>gin</i> like a child. I should like to see the tears of a
white man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you may do,&rdquo; replied the object of this
sarcasm, &ldquo;provided you can make them flow. Unbind my hands,
give me a nullah nullah, and try. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You will not? No!
You are afraid! For you know well I would quickly make you weaker
than a woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An aged black here interposed to stop the progress of this
scolding match, whispering something to the other, who appeared to
acquiesce, and sat down. The senior next went round to all the
older warriors, with whom he held a short parley in suppressed
tones.</p>

<p>At last he returned to his seat, and after resting awhile, arose
and said, &ldquo;Pale stranger, you were once thrown out of the sea
upon our fishing-ground. A wise man, <i>who is not</i>, but who had
been a mighty warrior in his younger days, saw in your face the
likeness of a son that had passed away. He saved your life. He made
you into a warrior. For these things, which were very good, you
have brought evil upon our tribe. Two stout men, who yesterday
could have helped to defend us from our foes, have fallen by your
hand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For all this, justice forbids us to take your
life, because those that are gone endeavoured first to kill you
before your club was lifted against them. But you may not stay here
longer, lest the angry spirits of the departed take vengeance on
the tribe for allowing you to live unpunished. Go then! Take your
women, your dogs and your weapons. The land is wide. Dwell where
you think fit, but come no more near our hunting-grounds
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have spoken. Do I say well, my
brothers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The usual acquiescent grunt was given by all around, and the old
man then went on, &ldquo;Will you go then in peace and leave
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh replied he would, adding sarcastically, &ldquo;The sun
is as hot and the fish are as fat in other parts as they are
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sign was now made by the ancient orator, and Rashleigh&rsquo;s
bonds were loosened.</p>

<p>The old man, looking round, said, &ldquo;If any of our black
brethren do not like the decision of the old men, now that the pale
stranger is free, let them attack him in the face of all the tribe
and take better vengeance for the fallen on fair and equal
terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two warriors jumped up at once, but the one who had taunted our
adventurer claiming the precedence, it was agreed they should fight
out their quarrel at noon, pending which Rashleigh retired to the
fires of the surviving gins, whom he found wailing and cutting
themselves over the body of poor Lorra, which they had laid out as
well as they could without help, ready for interment.</p>

<p>Our exile resolved that he would not bury her lifeless remains
near the tribe after what had passed, so he contrived a kind of
hand-barrow; and placing the corpse upon it, he directed the two
survivors to carry it northwards along the beach until they should
arrive at an inlet which was generally looked on as the boundary of
the fishing-ground belonging to this tribe. There they were to
await his arrival, having also taken with them the dogs, their
trifling stock of implements, as fishing-lines, etc., leaving
nothing to our exile but his weapons, with which he grimly waited
the appointed hour.</p>

<p>The shadows of the trees were at their feet when all the tribe
assembled on their council ground, where the fight instantly began
by Rashleigh&rsquo;s opponent, as usual, offering his head to
receive a blow of the white man&rsquo;s weapon. But the latter
sternly cried. &ldquo;Have done with your foolery, for if you put
your head in my way again, you will need no second blow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The black now began to make several feints of attack, while
Ralph, offering at his head, struck him a violent blow upon his
knee that was left unguarded, which felled him to the earth. The
white man, observing that none came to aid the prostrate black, but
rather seemed to expect that he should kill him, cried out,
&ldquo;Take the warrior away. I will not deprive your tribe of any
more,&rdquo; and left the spot for ever.</p>

<p>Our adventurer now pursued the path he had pointed out to his
gins, whom he soon overtook, and giving them his weapons, relieved
them of their melancholy burden, which he continued to carry the
whole day in his arms, never stopping until night. His two sable
companions at first expressed their grief by loud cries after the
manner of their country, until Rashleigh at last bade them to be
silent, in so stern a tone that they did not breathe another
whisper until they halted in the evening, when Ralph told them to
prepare a fire, and they departed chattering about their usual
tasks. Enee went to fish, and very soon returned with a huge bonito
which she had killed in a shoal place where it had been left by the
receding tide. Some slices of this were prepared and the gins
eagerly besought Rashleigh to eat; but his mind was too much
oppressed by his recent loss, and he only begged of them to get
their own suppers and go to sleep as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Our adventurer spent a most melancholy night watching the
lifeless remains of her who had loved him so truly through that
portion of their life during which they had been acquainted that
the intensity of her affection, as expressed by every gesture and
even glance, might be more fitly compared to that which the olden
pagans felt for their divinities than that which is known among
mere mortals for each other. That she had at last fallen a victim
to her love was also plain enough, for had Rashleigh first attacked
Tumba, he might have been speared, but she would undoubtedly have
been saved, and yet with generous self-devotion she hindered him
from doing so, lest he should be pierced by Terrawelo&rsquo;s
weapon. &ldquo;Alas, poor girl!&rdquo; was Rashleigh&rsquo;s
involuntary exclamation, as he took his last glance of her next
morning. &ldquo;Though your skin was black as ebony, yet your heart
was pure and true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A deep grave after the fashion of his native land, wrought with
much labour by Rashleigh&rsquo;s toil for many hours, received the
cold body of poor Lorra, to which our exile mournfully paid all the
last offices with his own hands, wrapping her in his best skin
cloak and finally depositing her corpse upon an ample couch of
silky grass within her narrow resting-place, which lay beside a
murmuring rivulet at the foot of a pendant acacia that even now
weeps the dews of heaven upon her last bed. And never were tears
dropped of more sincere sorrow than those which our exile shed to
the memory of this true and affectionate, though ignorant and
artless being. He lay beside the grave all that day and night, and
the next morning resumed his march along the beach, often looking
back upon that spot where he felt that he had left all that was
dear to him upon earth, the only female to whom himself was ever
dear, except his sister and his mother.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">As the tall ship, whose lofty prore<br>
Shall never stem the billows more,<br>
Deserted by her gallant band,<br>
Amid the breakers lies astrand.</p>

<p>For nearly six months after his separation from the tribe with
whom he had abode so long did Ralph Rashleigh pursue his course
northward along the beach, only turning inland when the mouth of
some wide river intervened, whose bank he then followed until it
became narrow enough to cross it upon a catamaran or bark canoe,
lodging at night under the cliffs, in caverns, or in the open air,
as the weather dictated or as such conveniences were readily
attained, and living chiefly upon fish caught by torchlight as the
least troublesome mode of obtaining them, varied occasionally by a
meal of cockles, oysters, limpets, or roots, if any such presented
themselves.</p>

<p>He passed through many tribes of coast blacks, some of whose
language he very imperfectly understood; but having assumed the
character of a wandering <i>carandjie</i>, or doctor-priest, which
his experience with his old black patron had sufficiently taught
him how to sustain and to support by painted marks and other
appliances on his person, he was never molested by any of the
aborigines, who on the contrary always treated him with abundance
of rude hospitality, suffering him to remain in their camps as long
as he chose and to depart when he pleased, though they seldom
failed to exert their utmost powers of persuasion to induce him to
fix his abode among them altogether.</p>

<p>At length he reached the utmost north-eastern point of land on
the coast of New Holland and just at the entrance of Torres
straits. From the summit of a lofty mountain he could see many
small islands, which he doubted not formed part of the Indian
archipelago; and he fixed his longing eyes upon them as abodes of
that civilization which he felt he was perhaps never more destined
to enjoy. How ardently did he now wish for the assistance of some
of his unfortunate boat companions, and reflected with bitter
regret that if only Roberts had been spared, they might together
have contrived some means of crossing the strait, which is not very
wide in several places, though it is full of many intricate
channels formed by adverse currents.</p>

<p>Rashleigh lay nearly the whole day upon this eminence, and only
returned to the beach at nightfall, where he found the two gins,
who were much alarmed at his absence. The next morning, having
resumed their march, he was greatly surprised to see, at about a
mile from the shore, the remains of a wrecked vessel which he had
taken for a portion of the rocks on which she lay when he had been
upon his elevated point of observation.</p>

<p>The tide was running out, the water was calm, but there was
great danger from the sharks, that are very numerous in those seas,
so that our adventurer feared to swim, and there was no wood at
hand fit for making into a catamaran. But he explained to the gins
his wish of reaching the wreck and dispatched them along the shore
to look for any timbers that might have floated in, while he laid
together all the fishing-lines they possessed into cordage, for the
purpose of tying and securing the timbers of a raft.</p>

<p>After some delay, Tita, one of the gins, <i>cooeed</i> loudly to
him from a considerable distance, making signs of surprise and
lamentation. Rashleigh hastened to her side, and there he found one
of the tops of the ill-fated vessel, with the remains of no less
than four unfortunate persons lashed fast to it. They presented a
most revolting sight, being in an advanced state of decomposition
and washed by the salt waves ever and anon, that as they retired
carried off portions of the flesh.</p>

<p>Nothing therefore could be done but to cut loose the fastenings
that yet bound them to the frame they had so vainly put their trust
in; and scraping a deep hole in the sand, the remains were thus
inhumed together. But as Tita was turning over one of the corpses,
the pocket of a pair of canvas trousers worn by the deceased gave
way, and a considerable quantity of gold coin rolled on the beach,
part of which went into the water. The gins were attracted by the
glitter of these shining pieces of metal, and they collected all
they could find before they would pay any attention to the requests
of our exile, who wished to hasten with his sad task of performing
the last offices of humanity to his unfortunate fellow-countrymen,
and who looked upon money as being perfectly worthless to him in
his present circumstances.</p>

<p>When this was performed they set to work, and with two strong
booms that lay near, and the top, they quickly formed a raft of
most respectable dimensions. Then, cutting out two rude paddles of
some broken wood, Rashleigh gave one to each of the gins, reserving
a long one for himself to steer with, and he thus put to sea with
all his family, for the eight or nine curs that constantly followed
either himself or the women would by no means be left behind on the
present occasion, but leaped into the water and swam stoutly after
them, until Ralph found they distracted the attention of Enee and
Tita, who kept calling to and encouraging them, instead of plying
their paddles, so that he at length told them to stop, and all the
dogs were then placed on the catamaran, which, assisted by the
ebbing tide, soon reached the wreck.</p>

<p>The ill-fated vessel appeared to have been of about five or six
hundred tons burden. All her masts, her bulwarks and her forecastle
had been totally carried away. In fact, not so much as a hen-coop
had been left on her spar deck, which was clean swept by the
violence of the gale, that also seemed to have nearly parted her in
two a little abaft the main-chains. She lay canted, or leaning
slightly, to one side in a sort of indentation upon the reef that
upheld her as firmly as the stocks upon which she had been erected;
and from her great height it appeared almost a hopeless task to
think of getting on board of her, as the fury of the storm had torn
away every particle of rope, so that no friendly end hung down, and
the bowsprit being also swept off close to the head, neither bridle
nor martingale remained that he could throw a rope over.</p>

<p>At length he bethought himself of a scheme. There was part of a
stanchion left erect, belonging to the bulwark near the
fore-chains, so, going under the lowermost side of the wreck, he
took the cord he had made on shore, and fastening a stone to it
that Enee used for a sinker to her fishing-line, he cast it over
the stanchion after the manner of the lasso wielded by South
American horsemen, hoping the stone might twist round the piece of
wood and thus enable him to haul himself up by the cord. His
attempts failed, and after repeating them until he was tired, he
sat down in utter despair to try to invent some other plan.</p>

<p>Enee took up the rejected line, and laughing, said, &ldquo;Me
try now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh only smiled; but the <i>gin</i>, coiling up the line
in her left hand, swung the stone round her head two or three
times, let it go with a peculiar jerk, and it was fast in an
instant.</p>

<p>Our exile quickly ascended, and the only place that he could see
open on the deck being the companion-way, he went down this into
the principal cabin, where of course everything was in great
confusion; but in one of the sleeping-berths he thought he heard a
moaning sound, as of some human being in pain. He had some
difficulty in opening the door which led to this apartment, but at
length knocked out the panels with his tomahawk. Here upon a cot
lay what he at first took to be merely a heap of clothing. He went
over and then discovered it was in fact two females and a child,
all three attenuated by famine and apparently dead.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain whether life had actually departed,
Rashleigh gently turned over the nearest one to him. She feebly
opened her eyes and emitted another of those piteous moans that had
at first attracted our adventurer to the place. Yet, apparently
exhausted as she was, a mother&rsquo;s feelings prevailed over all
others, for at the sight of the sooty-looking being that stood
beside her, she shuddered convulsively and clasped the child more
closely. There was something so exquisitely pathetic in the mutely
imploring glance she gave our exile the next moment that quite
melted him, and he burst into tears.</p>

<p>This was neither a time nor a place, however, for indulging in
useless grief; so, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, our adventurer
returned to the main cabin, which he searched all over, and then
went forward through an opening that he found in the bulkhead along
the deck, which was empty, until he reached the sailors&rsquo;
berths, where it was very dark, until by dint of hard labour he
partly cut and partly broke up the hatchway. Here he soon found
some wine and a keg of water, with which he returned, and picking
up a whole tumbler that lay among a heap of rubbish in a corner, he
mixed some wine, water and sugar together. Re-entering the
sleeping-cabin where these poor creatures lay, he moistened the
lips of each and soon had the gratification to find that all three
lived. The child drank most eagerly and soon afterwards began to
cry, &ldquo;Mamma, Mamma, take black man away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother could only reply by a feeble embrace, but Rashleigh
left their presence and returned to the main-deck, where he threw
the end of a rope, which he took out of the sailors&rsquo;
quarters, to his gins, bidding them make fast the raft to it and
come on board. While they did this he anxiously gazed around to see
what kind of weather seemed to promise for the night, as the day
was now far advanced, and he wished to remain on board until
morning, which would have been highly dangerous if it should come
on to blow, as in that case the vessel must have gone to pieces at
the furthest in four or five hours. Never had he before looked so
anxiously at the horizon. But he could see nought that boded
wind.</p>

<p>Being unwilling, however, in a matter of so much moment to rely
solely upon his own judgment, as soon as Enee got upon the deck he
asked what she thought the weather would be on the morrow. She
looked round for an instant and replied, &ldquo;Very hot day will
be to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then directed her to go below, and when Tita came up repeated
his question. This <i>gin</i> took rather longer to scan the
heavens; but at last she said, &ldquo;That sun very saucy
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Very much hot to-morrow;&rdquo; which set
Rashleigh&rsquo;s mind at rest, for almost the smallest indications
of a change in the weather are visible to these untutored children
of nature, to whom the knowledge is in fact absolutely necessary,
as they spend their whole lives in the open air.</p>

<p>Ralph now went once more below, where he found Enee examining
all she saw with many an exclamation of wonder, and the child
crying lustily for food. He set both the gins to work to make a
fire in the cabin stove, which luckily was uninjured, and departed
to discover some food if possible. After some research. he made
shift to force his way into the hold, where among the cases, casks
and hampers that formed the trifling cargo there was on board, a
small place had been apparently formed as a kind of steward&rsquo;s
room. At least, from articles he found there fit for table and
culinary purposes, that was the opinion our exile formed of the use
of the little apartment, where, among other things, were some tins
of preserved meat, fine biscuit, flour, sugar, etc., with some of
which and a tea-kettle he returned to the cabin, where a good fire
had been made by the gins out of the fragments of the broken door
and articles of furniture that plentifully strewed the deck. The
stove roared very much as the flames acquired power, and Enee and
Tita were greatly afraid, as they thought the noise proceeded from
something supernatural, until Rashleigh pointed out to them the
smoke going astern out of a funnel pipe, to which he placed
Enee&rsquo;s ear, and bade her listen, telling her at the same time
it was the pent-up smoke that made the noise. This seemed to remove
their fear, and in a short time they willingly assisted in
preparing a mess of weak soup with some biscuit broken up very
small in it, which Rashleigh judged the most fitting food for the
invalids, and of which they all very gratefully partook.</p>

<p>Our adventurer now resumed his researches, after having made a
plentiful meal &mdash; the first in nearly five years &mdash; of
European food, consisting of boiled salt beef, biscuit and tea, the
only part of which that pleased Tita or Enee was biscuit soaked in
tea, which they first saturated with sugar. Ralph next began to
consider how he could get the rescued sufferers on shore, as it was
plain they would not be able to help themselves in any way for some
time, and every hour might be the last of the wreck. He at length
determined on forming a large raft of all the hatches and gratings
he could find, and of lowering the ladies with the child down to it
in a cot, then to load it with anything he could get in the shape
of provisions which it would contain and tow it to the shore.</p>

<p>All night himself and the gins worked at this. Fortunately they
found a coil of coir rope of a small size, which made good
lashings; and besides, it was moonlight. So after they had
collected the whole of the movable articles they could find and
placed them under the main hatchway, Enee lowered them down the
vessel&rsquo;s side to Rashleigh as fast as Tita handed them up to
her. Our adventurer, placed on his own catamaran beneath the side
of the wreck, received the materials as they came to him, selecting
first the gratings which he intended for the lowest part of the new
raft, and bound them as firmly together as possible by passing
ropes between the bars over and under, across and athwart again, in
every direction, until he had made a sort of floor about seven feet
wide and more than twelve feet long. On this he bound another tier
of gratings and lastly the hatches, with doors knocked off the
cabins to make a level deck on the top of all. These last he
secured by driving a nail or two here and there into them, Tita
having found some nails and a hammer put up in a bag, where they
had apparently been thrown after securing the hatches by their
means in the storm.</p>

<p>It was just daylight when this undertaking was completed, and
Rashleigh found, by throwing in some chips, that the tide was
running out again; so he lay down to sleep for a while, after
having attended to the wants of his invalid charges. When he awoke
the sun was high in the heavens, and he began to fear he had slept
too long; but on repeating his experiment, he was glad to perceive
the tide was now set in strongly towards the shore. He therefore
got a large cot on deck, lashed it fast to the only standing
stanchion before referred to, and soon placed his rescued freight
into it; for though he was obliged to carry the child and mother
together, as they clung so closely one to the other that he could
not have separated them without using force, yet both were scarcely
so heavy as a good-sized infant.</p>

<p>Our adventurer eased them all down in the cot himself. They were
received and placed on the raft by the gins, upon whom the feeble
invalids appeared to gaze with much surprise. The fear of the child
for their colour had apparently been overcome, probably because
Rashleigh had fed it twice. A loading of useful articles having
been soon made up, the gins took to their paddles and they all
reached the shore in a very short time, near some beetling cliffs,
selected by Ralph for that purpose from the prospect they afforded
of shelter and concealment.</p>

<p>Having discovered a place where an impending rock formed a kind
of roof, he disembarked the passengers by carrying the cot between
himself and Tita. He then placed them beneath the shelter and
transferred them to another more spacious resting-place, formed
with sails which he had brought on shore with him. Lastly he put
all his freight on the land and left it, together with the
invalids, in charge of Enee, giving her directions as to supplying
the latter with food, also how to make a signal in case any blacks
should approach; although he deemed the last scarcely a possible
contingency, as he had not seen the traces of any human footsteps
for several days, nor were there any of the usual indications for
miles along the coast that this part was frequented by any tribe
whatever, which Rashleigh attributed to the nature of the
surrounding soil, it being exceedingly dry and poor, without either
swamps or dense thickets, which afford the most favourite food of
the aborigines of Australia.</p>

<p>Rashleigh returned to the wreck and instituted a very strict
search over it for articles that might be serviceable, in
particular female apparel suitable to his charge, and provisions,
of both which he found an ample supply. A desk placed in the main
cabin contained a quantity of writing materials and a large sum in
bills of exchange, both of which he also secured, far more for the
sake of the former than of the latter. After these the only things
he thought of any real value to them under their circumstances were
some carpenters&rsquo; tools, fire-arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>The conveyance of these stores to the shore occupied Rashleigh
and the <i>gin</i> Tita the whole of that day and a great part of
the ensuing night, although they laboured unremittingly, as they
observed indications of a storm. And they had not been upon the
shore more than half an hour with their last freight before a
tempest came on from the south-cast, accompanied with that low
moaning sound which betokens the awakening of the mighty winds,
that in a very short time covered the ocean with foam and gave
great reason to our adventurer for heartfelt rejoicing at his
singularly opportune arrival, because it now became evident that if
his coming had been delayed but for thirty-six hours the wreck must
have gone to pieces, and the poor sufferers been whelmed in the
deep, even if they had survived any longer the assaults of famine,
which had indeed obviously reduced them to the last gasp of
existence when they were so fortunately relieved by Rashleigh.</p>

<p>Despite the roaring of the elemental war, our adventurer, who
was quite worn out with fatigue, soon slept soundly, though not
before he had satisfied himself by examination that their place of
refuge was safe both from the waves and from the rain, which
shortly began to fall in torrents. A sail hung up at the entrance
secured them from the latter, even in case of a shift of wind, and
the distance, not being less than 150 feet from high-water mark
assured him they were out of reach of the former.</p>

<p>By daybreak next morning Rashleigh was on the beach. The rain
and wind had both ceased, and all the surrounding country
gratefully acknowledged the refreshing moisture. The ocean,
however, presented the wildest scene of mountain billows our
adventurer had ever witnessed. Around the reef that had proved so
fatal to the ship, in particular, the wreaths of spray were foaming
many yards up towards the sky. Ralph could not identify the exact
spot on which the wreck had been, of which, however, he saw no
vestige near the rocks where she had lain the day before; but many
fragments that floated on the billows, and a few that strewed the
shore, told too plainly what had been her fate.</p>

<p>For a week or more after this our exile occupied himself in
forming a dwelling under the rock he had at first selected, which
he resolved on retaining because he could find none superior in
accommodation. Upon the one hand, it presented the double advantage
of being open to the sea, so that they were enabled to see any
passing vessel; while it was perfectly invisible, as well as
inaccessible, from the shore, the only mode of approach being by a
catamaran or boat, owing to projecting cliffs that stretched on
either side, far into the sea.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, their habitation was both simple
and rude, consisting only of the cave, along the exposed front of
which our exile had set up stanchions picked up from the wreck. On
these he had nailed boards derived from the same source. Thus he
had formed a front and had contrived to afford air, light and
entrance to the interior by fixing in it a door and four small sash
windows, also procured from the cabins of the unfortunate vessel.
For the floor of the interior they had the solid rock, which, if
not very level, was at least very hard, and easily kept clean.</p>

<p>They had no lack of really necessary furniture, as all that had
been in the cabins, with very slight exceptions, had either been
brought by our exile or had washed on the beach after the wreck
broke up. The domicile was divided, within, into three apartments,
one of which, in the centre, comprising nearly as much space as
both the others, contained the chief part of their stores, and was
common to all parties. On either hand of this were the sleeping
apartments, one appropriated to the invalids, the other to
Rashleigh and the gins. Both the latter rooms were hung round with
sails to cover the damp rocky sides of the cavern, and the
partitions between the apartments were formed of the same
articles.</p>

<p>In a few days the ladies recovered sufficiently to converse, and
the first use they made of their organs of speech was to return the
warmest thanks to their preserver. The child also was soon able to
run about, and Rashleigh now learned with surprise that he was
nearly seven years of age, though from his size the former scarcely
thought it much more than as many months. Ralph also ascertained
that the name of the ill-fated vessel had been the <i>Tribune</i>,
which had brought out convicts from England, and was then bound in
ballast for Calcutta, to which place these ladies were proceeding
to join the husband of one of them, a Captain Marby, H.E.I.C.S. The
other was her sister, and the little boy was the son of the
Captain.</p>

<p>It appeared that a week or ten days (for the ladies had no means
of telling exactly how long) before Rashleigh saw the wreck, the
<i>Tribune</i> had struck very suddenly upon the reef. It was not
blowing hard at the time, but both the females were confined to
their cabin by sickness, and it appears the crew thought it too
troublesome to make any effort for their safety, as the door could
not easily be opened; and overpowered by alarm, the ladies heard
them take to their boats, thus abandoning the wreck. The entrance
to their sleeping apartment had become too firmly fixed when the
ship struck for the unfortunate females to open it, and although
driven frantic at the thought of the fate that awaited them, they
exerted all their strength in ill-directed efforts; yet being
without implements of any kind, the door defied all their attempts,
which only exhausted their feeble frames, until at last they lay
down to die in despair, where Rashleigh had so happily found
them.</p>

<p>Many were the consultations held in the cave by the two ladies
with Ralph as to the best mode of escaping from the inhospitable
coast which formed their present retreat; but all ended in
acquiescing with him that it was better for them to remain in the
place of security they now occupied than to brave the labour and
danger attending a journey of many hundred miles along the beach,
exposed to the hostility or ill usage of the aborigines, from whom
Rashleigh felt his assumed character of a <i>carandjie</i> or his
personal strength might fail to prove a protection for so many
women.</p>

<p>Their retreat being in the direct route pursued by vessels
between Sydney and India, of which there were even <i>then</i> two
or three at least passing annually, Rashleigh hoped it would riot
be long before they might be relieved. And in order to attract the
attention of any passing voyager he selected the point of a
promontory that jutted out far into the sea, where he set up a post
and hoisted upon it a Union Jack reversed. Beside this post he or
the gins every morning made a fire, hoping the smoke might excite
observation, when the flag would show it was Europeans in distress
that had caused it.</p>

<p>The mode of living pursued by the secluded party was at once
simple and rather abstemious, at least as regarded the provisions
rescued from the wreck, because they desired to make the latter
hold out as long as possible. The only food in which they indulged
unsparingly was fish, of which the ocean presented them an
inexhaustible supply. There was a small spring of fresh water that
oozed out of a joint in a neighbouring cliff, which by frugality
sufficed for their wants. And they discovered a wild sort of
spinach that grew luxuriously in a spot near their beacon, which
they usually boiled in salt water or with a piece of salt meat,
when they proved very palatable vegetables where none better could
be obtained.</p>

<p>It may be here observed that Rashleigh did not allow the ladies
to imagine he was aught beside what he seemed, an aboriginal native
of New Holland, and he accounted to them for his knowledge of the
English tongue and the appliances of civilized life by stating that
he had been brought up from infancy until his twentieth year in the
family of an eminent officer of the colonial government at Sydney,
but that death having deprived him of his white protector, he had,
like many others of his countrymen and women similarly bred,
returned to the erratic life of a savage, the independence of which
he preferred to the labour and restraint of civilized society. Our
exile had carefully cautioned the gins not to betray the secret of
his colour; and he confidently relied upon their secrecy, because
they not only were really attached to him, but they also feared him
for a superstitious reason as well as for his superiority in
strength and his knowledge of all the rude arts practised by the
savages.</p>

<p>This superstition arose from an idea very prevalent among these
simple beings that all the whites who have made their appearance in
Australia are animated by the spirits of departed blacks, so that
when any aborigine sees a white person for the first time he or she
will give the latter a native name derived from a fancied
resemblance to some deceased member of their own tribe. In
conformity with this absurd notion the ancient <i>carandjie</i>, on
adopting our adventurer, had bestowed upon him the name of Bealla,
which referred in a very distant manner to a peculiarity in the
walk of one of the old chief&rsquo;s sons, who had fallen in battle
with a hostile tribe many years before. This is the nearest
approach they ever dare to make towards recalling the memory of the
dead, and this is never done except in cases like the present. The
blacks also believe that persons thus adopted by them still possess
all the knowledge they had acquired of native usages, besides skill
in the arts of civilization derived from the whites, the former
having remained to them since their previous state of existence;
and they therefore generally hold them in great awe as persons who
from their double attainments are able to know even the motives of
actions and all things both past and present.</p>

<p>Several months passed away in a very monotonous manner to the
inhabitants of the rocky retreat on the coast, the ladies chiefly
amusing themselves by teaching the gins Enee and Tita the manners
of white females, which the others learned with great avidity and
soon became exceedingly partial to such dress as came within their
reach, though the natural predilection of the savage still betrayed
itself in their love of gaudy colours and their repugnance to any
covering upon the head or feet. Rashleigh occupied himself in
providing fuel or fish, in cleaning and arranging his unused arms,
or at night in teaching the gins to read.</p>

<p>One day, in the eighth month of their sojourn here, our exile
had walked up the beacon hill which commanded the view over a wide
expanse of land and sea. At a considerable distance towards the
north he saw the smoke of several fires, which he knew at once
could proceed from none but blacks encamped. He therefore resolved
that he would reconnoitre them more closely, as it was of great
consequence he should ascertain their dispositions and intentions,
in case they might become aware of the occupancy of the cliff.</p>

<p>He therefore did not make any fire on the hill and pulled down
both the post and flag, so that it might not excite observation. He
then returned to the cave and intimated cautiously to the ladies
that there was a tribe of his countrymen at some distance, whose
motions it was necessary that he should go and observe. A very
affecting scene now ensued; for the mother, fearing for the safety
of her child as well as that of herself and sister, with many tears
implored our exile that he would neither betray nor desert them.
The younger lady and the little boy also added their tears and
entreaties, nor was it for some time that the earnest assurances of
our exile could pacify them.</p>

<p>At nightfall Ralph lay aside the sailor&rsquo;s dress which he
had constantly worn since the wreck, and resumed the old, character
of a <i>carandjie</i>, the only things he retained of European make
being a double-barrelled gun, some ammunition and a pair of pistols
concealed in his opossum-skin belt. It was several miles to the
camp and our adventurer did not reach it until nearly morning. By
the number of fires the tribe appeared to be numerous, and
according to custom the disguised white man went straight to the
fire belonging to the chief. He was unmolested in passing through
the camp by the dogs, who, if awoke by his stealthy, springy step,
only snuffled about him and slunk off in silence. The chief lay
asleep and alone; so Rashleigh made up the fire, filled a pipe with
tobacco, sat down and smoked in silence for some time. At last the
savage awoke, and seeing as he judged a strange <i>carandjie</i>
sitting by the fire eating smoke, he sat up and a conversation
ensued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my brother <i>carandjie</i> hungry, that he devours
the wind of the fire?&rdquo; enquired the stranger black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I devour the fire wind to make me wise but not to satisfy
my hunger,&rdquo; replied the mock magician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the tribe of my brother far away?&rdquo; was the next
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fathers dwelt many moons&rsquo; joumey nearer to the
rain than this,&rdquo; returned Rashleigh. &ldquo;But I wander
through the land at my pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does my brother,&rdquo; now asked the strange chief,
&ldquo;travel so far without a <i>gin</i> to wait upon
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise man waits on himself,&rdquo; replied the sham
<i>carandjie</i> with great solemnity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added he more briskly, &ldquo;all the gins of
the weakest are mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, it is just,&rdquo; assented the black. &ldquo;But
is not my brother lonely for want of company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need no company but my own thoughts, and the spirits of
wise men that are departed, but who hover around us everywhere,
ready to come if anyone is bold enough to call them,&rdquo;
returned the disguised white man.</p>

<p>At this the recumbent chief arose, casting a fearful glance
around him as he did so. Then, having procured a quantity of dry
fuel that lay close at hand, he put it on the fire, and by the
glare that sprung up he looked long and earnestly at his untimely
visitor. Rashleigh during this investigation refilled his pipe very
calmly, adding a few grains of gunpowder to the tobacco.</p>

<p>At length the stranger remarked in a kind of awe-stricken
whisper, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very true, our fathers have told us: the
spirits of the dead are everywhere, but none of our tribe ever
thought it safe to call on them. Do these fearful visitants never
try to injure the hardy warrior that seeks their company?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be certain, oh my brother,&rdquo; replied Ralph,
&ldquo;that not every <i>carandjie</i> can control the tempers of
the dead. He, however, who can speak to them with words of fire
need never fear aught they can do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the moment the gunpowder in his pipe blazed up and formed
such a striking commentary upon his words that he at once perceived
he had attained his object in exacting a high degree of respect
from his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>At daylight the camp was in commotion, for the warriors thronged
around the strange <i>carandjie</i>, eager to learn the news
respecting the movements of the tribes along the coast. Rashleigh
told them all he knew; but as he expected, this was fresh to them,
for they had not learned aught of it. In fact, the coast tribes
rarely have any communication.</p>

<p>A hunt was proposed, when our adventurer displayed the power of
his weapons to great advantage before these savages, who had never
seen any fire-arms used before; and amid the drunkenness of a great
feast that ensued in honour of our adventurer&rsquo;s visit, he
made his exit from among them unobserved, having gained his end of
making an impression upon them that in case of a collision he knew
would be highly advantageous to him.</p>

<p>Having gone part of his way in the salt water so as effectually
to prevent the blacks from tracking him, he reached the cavern
unmolested. But after this, as he wished not to excite their
observation, he abstained from lighting a fire or hoisting his flag
on the beacon bill, contenting himself with keeping a sharp
look-out all day upon the sea. In his absence he deputed Enee to do
so in his room, having given her instructions what to do in case
any vessel should heave in sight.</p>

<p>For many weeks the tribe of blacks remained near the spot where
Rashleigh had at first seen them, and during this period our exile
paid them repeated visits, always taking care, however, to leave
them in a sudden and mysterious manner, so that they could never
trace him; which, with other arts used for this purpose, induced
the savages at length to look upon him as being a very great
magician, who could make himself invisible at will.</p>

<p>One night our exile, oppressed by anxiety at the flight of time
without any means being afforded of his leaving the place he was
in, had wandered to the top of a neighbouring eminence, from which,
on looking in that direction, he was greatly surprised to observe
that the blacks were holding a night council, which is never done
among these people except in cases of great emergency. Stopping
only therefore to prepare himself for his assumed character of a
<i>carandjie</i>, our adventurer hastened towards the camp of the
tribe, on approaching nearer to which he found the whole of the
warriors, armed and equipped for fight, were engaged in the
performance of that frightful war-dance with which they stimulate
themselves to a pitch of ferocity prior to engaging in any arduous
enterprise, accompanying their motions by an extemporaneous song
all the while, which, referring to the past exploits of their most
renowned warriors and magnifying their valorous deeds with more
than eastern exaggeration, promised to exceed them all in acts of
daring upon the present occasion. From expressions relating to
their present purpose, made use of in this song, Rashleigh quickly
found that there was a ship manned by white men in some sort of
distress not far off, whose commander, foolishly thinking to
purchase the goodwill of these treacherous savages, had treated
them very kindly, making them large presents of glittering gew-gaws
used in barter. Besides, which was greater folly than all, he had
given them a portion of that bane to the uncivilized of all
colours, <i>rum</i>, and this had stimulated them, for the sake of
getting more, to seek his destruction.</p>

<p>After our exile had elicited this information from the terms of
their savage song, taking an opportunity in the evolutions of the
dance, he stepped forth from his place of concealment and placed
his hand upon the shoulder of the chief before any eye had observed
his approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hu!&rdquo; cried the stranger with a start, as on turning
he observed the mysterious <i>carandjie</i>; but added, though
rather in a sulky tone, &ldquo;My brother is welcome, if he comes
as a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lips speak words that are not in your heart,&rdquo;
replied the sham conjurer. &ldquo;You do not wish me to be here
lest I should defeat your intended attack on the white
strangers&rsquo; big canoe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother knows everything!&rdquo; cried Tocalli in
surprise. &ldquo;But he will join with our tribe in plundering the
pale rulers of the wind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First tell me, oh Tocalli, whether you love your own
people?&rdquo; enquired the disguised white man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should the wise <i>carandjie</i> ask that?&rdquo;
demanded the chief. &ldquo;He knows I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then if you do, allow the white men to depart in peace.
They have plenty of weapons, such as mine. If you conquer them many
of your tribe must die. And what will happen to those that are
left? Can you tell, oh Tocalli?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The black shook his head, but answered nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can! The fire-water of the white men will make
them mad. They will drink till they fight, fight till they kill,
and kill till none remain alive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no matter!&rdquo; cried Tocalli. &ldquo;My
brother speaks the words of a coward. He looks like a man, but his
heart is that of a <i>gin</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In conversing thus, they had strayed close to die edge of the
sea at a spot that Rashleigh knew, where some rocks lay that had
moderately deep water beside them. Our exile, while the strange
chief Tocalli was last speaking, had put a small quantity of powder
in his pipe; and they walked upon the rock in silence for a second
or two, when, the fire reaching it, the gunpowder exploded. While
the blackfellow was dazzled and confounded, Rashleigh slipped into
the tide and swam off as quietly as he could, making his way to a
side of the bay, where, by the signs of his late companion, he
understood that some goods belonging to the white men had been
landed to lighten their distressed vessel.</p>

<p>It was some time after Ralph had reached the shore before he
could find out the pile of stores; but at length he did so and
concealed himself among them, anxiously waiting for morning in the
hope that he might find some means of communicating to the seamen
intelligence of the proposed attack of the blacks, and resolved, if
he could do so by no other means, that he would swim off to the
vessel, though the danger from sharks was so imminent that in that
case it was but a chance he would ever reach it.</p>

<p>When morning dawned our exile could see that the big canoe
spoken of by the blacks was, in reality, a schooner of about 150
tons burden, which had apparently got on shore on the point of a
low sandy islet nearly two miles from the land. While he was yet
gazing on her he saw two boats loaded with goods putting off from
her side, which made for his place of concealment. The blacks were
also all in motion, many of them pretending to fish along the
shore, while a few others, among whom was Tocalli, walked
loungingly up to the pile of stores. They were apparently unarmed;
but Rashleigh could see that in the tufts of opossum skin that
depended behind from his belt, each man bad a nullah nullah
concealed.</p>

<p>The boats meantime had reached the shore, and a person who
seemed to be the captain landing, Tocalli went up to him. The white
man said, &ldquo;Shake hands, chief,&rdquo; offering his own to the
savage for that purpose.</p>

<p>Rashleigh was so close to both that he could even see the
malignant gleam of satisfaction that sparkled from Tocalli&rsquo;s
eye as he extended his left hand to the unsuspecting stranger,
while his right hand sought the weapon with which he designed to
immolate the white man on the spot.</p>

<p>In the mean time each of the savages had got close to one of the
sailors. There was not an instant to be lost. Just as the black
chief had drawn out his waddy, a bullet from the piece of our exile
entered his brain, and he fell dead without a cry or a
struggle.</p>

<p>Ralph, springing out of his hiding-place, called aloud,
&ldquo;Beware, white men, the treacherous rascals are going to
murder you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blacks had, in fact, each seized his man at a signal from
Tocalli; but the sudden report of the gun, accompanied by his fall,
so much amazed them that the sailors easily shook off their grips
and hastily retreated to their boats.</p>

<p>The captain cried out to recall them; but Rashleigh recommended
him to let them go for some arms, returning from the ship with all
speed, as, so little had they dreamed of any danger from the
savages, that not a man had brought so much as a pistol, and the
greater part of the cargo was lying strewn close by their present
position. In the mean time, the blacks, having recovered in some
degree from their first affright, enraged at the death of their
chief and being strengthened by many others of the stragglers, now
rushed upon the white men with spears, boomerangs and clubs, of
which they poured in a volley that knocked the captain and a sailor
down. But the fall of one of their own number staggered them in
their advance, and the discharge of both barrels of
Rashleigh&rsquo;s piece, together with his pistols, immediately
afterwards completed their discomfiture, and they fled pell-mell to
the nearest thicket.</p>

<p>It was now high water of a spring tide, and a stock of fire-arms
being brought by the boat, her crew also reported to the captain
the welcome intelligence that the schooner floated, needing
nothing, as they believed, but a pull or two by the capstan on the
anchor they had dropped ahead to heave her off altogether. The
commander, who at present had not time to express either his thanks
for or his amazement at the opportune assistance rendered by our
adventurer, whom he knew not what to think of, unless he might be
an <i>angel in mourning</i>, was now anxious to return on board
with all the hands he could obtain to man the vessel for this
purpose; and our adventurer volunteered his services, provided they
would load and leave all the fire-arms they had brought with them,
that he on his part would mount guard over the goods. The captain
would not at first hear of this, saying that he would not for the
sake of twenty times as much goods wish that harm should happen to
the man who had saved all their lives. But Rashleigh, persisting in
his request, absolutely refused to go on board the schooner with
them, saying that he knew his countrymen too well to believe there
could be any danger of their so soon attacking him after they were
once fairly beaten off, but if they did, he could give them so warm
a reception, having the means of twenty discharges, that they would
quickly turn tail again. At length the captain returned with all
his men to the schooner, and Ralph, having laid the fire-arms ready
cocked upon a row of cases, paced to and fro in their front with a
double-barrelled gun in his hand.</p>

<p>For some time not a sign nor a sound disturbed the solitude and
silence of the lonely beach. The blacks all appeared to have
retreated for good, and Rashleigh ventured to look round at last at
the schooner, whence the song of the mariners heaving at the
capstan now began faintly to reach his ear. For a few seconds the
labour seemed ineffectual; but at length Rashleigh plainly saw her
move. She appeared about to plunge into the water, when he received
a spear in the leg, and several others rattled around him upon the
various casks and packages that strewed the beach. Doubly vexed at
his wound and the inattention that had permitted his enemies thus
to surprise him, he looked around without at first being able to
perceive from what quarter the attack emanated; but all at once he
caught the glare of a human eye, fixed upon him from behind a
sand-bank. In an instant his gun was at his shoulder; another, and
he had pulled the trigger. The black at whom he fired, leaping up
convulsively, fell dead upon the sand-bank, while another volley of
spears, one of which passed through his shoulder, hurtled into the
sand on every side of him.</p>

<p>Rashleigh now withdrew behind a cask, crouching down to pull the
spear from his leg, and the blacks, deeming perhaps he had fallen
by their last weapons, leaped up and came running towards him.
Another of them fell in the advance; but now, inured to the noise
of fire-arms, and their passions roused to fury, the survivors
rushed upon Ralph, who had not time to pick up another musket, but
clubbing his fowling-piece, defended himself with the butt end of
it until one of his assailants got within the sweep of it and
grappled him round the body. In a short time both were on the
ground, with eyes flashing fire. They tugged and strained for the
mastery, rolling over and over each other so quickly that more than
one blow intended by his sable antagonists for the white man fell
upon his unlucky opponent. At length something seemed to divert the
attention of the blacks from the affray for an instant. Our
adventurer was now uppermost, and drawing a pistol from his belt,
he blew the skull off his struggling enemy. A few shots fired from
an approaching boat drove away all the others.</p>

<p>The captain of the schooner landed a few moments after, and
finding Rashleigh alive though much hurt and bleeding, he hastily
but heartily congratulated him on his escape with life, insisting
that he should forthwith go on board to have his wounds dressed by
the steward. After this able medico had fulfilled his office, our
exile learned that the schooner was the <i>Sea Mew</i>, of Sydney,
which was returning from a trip of trade among the Fiji islands.
Ralph now acquainted the captain with the circumstance of his
having saved the ladies from the wreck of the <i>Tribune</i>, which
the latter had heard of and had left at Timor Coupang a vessel that
had been dispatched from New South Wales by Colonel Woodville, Mrs
Marby&rsquo;s father. in search of his daughters, who, with the
child, had been reported as left on board the wreck by a party that
had escaped after the <i>Tribune</i> struck and had made their way
southwards along the coast until they arrived at Port Macquarie,
then newly formed as a penal settlement. The commander of the
<i>Sea Mew</i> was well pleased to hear of the safety of Mrs Marby
and her sister, their father being much respected by all classes of
the colonists, and the loss of his children having been a severe
blow to the old gentleman. It was speedily arranged that as soon as
the schooner could he reloaded she should go round to the other bay
for the purpose of receiving the ladies; and as the depth of water
where they were was now known to her commander, the vessel was
enabled to stand in close to the shore, so that by the next morning
all her cargo was reshipped, and in a very few hours the <i>Sea
Mew</i> had anchored in the offing abreast of the cavern.</p>

<p>The condition of the ladies, who had been plunged into complete
despair by the absence of Rashleigh, whom they looked up to as
their only protector, and who were now almost intoxicated with joy
at the prospect of a happy release from their gloomy place of
confinement, may be more easily conceived than described.</p>

<p>Let it suffice to say that before evening the whole party, with
all that was thought worth removal, had been transferred to the
schooner, which weighed anchor about sunset with a favourable
breeze and pursued her voyage to Sydney.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32" id=
"Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32</b>
</h2>

<p class="note">One, midst the forests of the west,<br>
By a dark stream is laid &mdash;<br>
The indian knows his place of rest,<br>
Far in the cedar shade.</p>

<p>The <i>Sea Mew</i> swiftly breasted the bounding billows,
bearing the lost children to the arms of their sorrowing parent;
but the thoughts of our exile, as he marked hill after hill of the
coast that were so rapidly left behind him on his return but had
cost him so much toil to pass upon his journey northward, were of a
very foreboding cast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I may fairly claim some
consideration from the Colonel for preserving the lives of his
children and for restoring them to his embrace in safety and in
honour. But is it likely that an officer so high in the service
will deem that he can even owe thanks to a doubly convicted felon?
Will it not appear to him to be his duty to give me up to the law
for punishment, which cannot fail to award me an ignominious death
as having participated in an act of piracy, for such no doubt they
will call the seizure of the little boat, especially as it was
attended with a resistance to the authorities of Newcastle that
ended in the death of at least one commissioned officer in the
army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At length he bethought himself that as all his boat companions
were dead it would be impossible for anyone to prove he had ever
been of their party, and as there were every day, generally, some
prisoners running away from the limeburners, who for the most part
either perished miserably in the bush of starvation or joined the
blacks, why might he not be believed if he stated that he had
absconded by land as so many others had done before him? This
result appeared so probable, and in case it should prove to be
true, the consequences so trifling, that he resolved to attempt
this method of escaping from the difficulty of his position, as he
knew that at the worst the period of his banishment to the Coal
river having long since expired, the only punishment likely to be
inflicted on him for absconding would be perhaps fifty lashes, when
he would revert to the condition of an ordinary convict.</p>

<p>The day prior to that of their expected arrival at Sydney,
Rashleigh sought an interview with Mrs Marby and acquainted her,
after apologizing for not having told her the truth before, that he
was, in fact, a runaway, and that he trusted, in consideration of
his services to her, she would endeavour to prevail upon Colonel
Woodville to use Ins interest in obtaining pardon from the Governor
for his colonial offences.</p>

<p>The lady heard his tale with great surprise, though she remarked
she had often wondered at his superior intelligence; but with ready
female wit she added, &ldquo;As you have deceived me and all that
are on board this vessel, you may deceive many others into the
belief you are really an aboriginal black. So, for fear the Colonel
may not have the power to get you your liberty, I desire you will
not perrnit any other person to share in the secret you have told
me until I shall request it. For, to say the least of it, it would
be such a dreadful thing that you should lose your freedom through
saving our lives as I cannot bear to think of; and it were better
for you to fly into the wildest bush again, there to persevere in
the savage mode of life you have now become accustomed to, than
that you should again be subject to the miseries you relate having
suffered at the place you ran away from. At any rate, I will do my
best to interest my father in your behalf; but until I can do this,
pray remain black, although I should like to see what kind of a
white man you would make!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an air of truthfulness in this lady&rsquo;s address
which inspired Rashleigh with confidence, so he lay down to rest
with a much lighter heart; and ere he awoke next morning the <i>Sea
Mew</i> was running up the harbour of Port Jackson. To the surprise
of Captain Bell, our exile, instead of dressing himself in the best
European clothes he had got, stripped himself of those he then
wore, and assuming the opossum cloak and other paraphernalia of a
native warrior, caused Enee to paint his body and dress up his hair
with grass and feathers before he went on shore.</p>

<p>Colonel Woodville, having been informed of the safe arrival of
his daughters, sent a carriage for them to the wharf, himself being
confined to his bed of sickness. Mrs Marby requested our adventurer
to accompany them to his residence, and Rashleigh left the
schooner, promising the captain, who was very loath to part with
him, that he would soon return. The Colonel&rsquo;s domestics, who
idolized their young ladies and had understood the obligations they
lay under to the sooty personage who followed them, received
Rashleigh very cordially, welcoming him to the house, where they
said it was their master&rsquo;s order an apartment was to be
provided for Bealla &mdash; the native name of our exile &mdash;
and his two gins. The former, however, was rather puzzled and not a
little annoyed at the absurd remarks that greeted his every word
and action, proceeding from the female servants, who were not long
in the Colony and appeared to consider a native black of Australia
as only a higher sort of brute; and they were consequently much
astonished to observe that Ralph knew the usages of civilized life,
until he told them he had been bred in a white family, when their
exclamations of surprise at his having again taken to the bush
almost deafened him.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mrs Marby sent for our exile and informed him
that the joy of their meeting had so much overpowered the Colonel
as to make him rather worse. She said she had therefore postponed
until another day any mention of the real position of their
deliverer, whom, however, their father was most anxious to see,
that he might return thanks in person for those exertions that had
preserved his daughters. The lady also offered Rashleigh money and
begged of him to bring Tita and Enee home to their house, which she
insisted none of them were to quit any more, as the Colonel had
declared, while he had a shilling left, Bealla and his gins should
have a portion of it.</p>

<p>Ralph returned thanks for all this kindness and promised next
day to bring the two females with him. He declined to receive any
money, however, as he had several pieces of gold in his belt, and
besides, only intended to go back on board the <i>Sea Mew</i> for
that night. He then took his leave and returned to the vessel,
where he found Captain Bell eagerly awaiting his arrival, and Tita
and Enee not less so, the latter being very impatient to display a
whole milliner&rsquo;s shop of finery, which the captain and crew
had purchased for their use, and both these sable specimens of
feminine loveliness were now arrayed in costume which, considering
that expense had not been spared to make a show, and that the
steward, who purveyed the &ldquo;rigging&rdquo;, as he called it,
had endeavoured as closely as he could to copy the dress worn by
Poll Blazer of Portsmouth point, had at least the merit, perhaps a
questionable one, of being exceedingly original; though to judge
from the extraordinary attitudes assumed by both Tita and Enee, the
latter considered their pink silk bonnets with enormous green veils
streaming behind them in the breeze &mdash; as Captain Bell swore,
like the commodious broad pendant &mdash; and surmounted by a host
of magnificent blue and white feathers, as being the very <i>ne
plus</i> <i>ultra</i> of black elegance. A burst of uproarious
laughter from Ralph, as he surveyed the extraordinary. garb of the
gins, rather discomposed the majestic airs of the latter; but
Captain Bell, taking their part against our adventurer,
good-humouredly said that he only laughed to conceal his anger at
not being able to cut such a dash himself, when Enee at once pulled
off her bonnet and begged Bealla to put it on. Nor was it until
Ralph promised to go and dress himself that the <i>gin</i> could he
induced to desist in pressing that novel head-dress for a male upon
his notice.</p>

<p>At length they, and the urgent entreaties of the sailors,
induced Rashleigh to array himself once more in European clothing;
and although he put on a pair of broad pink-striped seaman&rsquo;s
trousers and an anchor-patterned shirt, with a flowing
handkerchief, and all else to correspond, he was scarcely fine
enough for the fastidious taste of the crew, who, with their
captain at their head, now insisted on the whole party adjourning
to a public-house, known as the Old Black Dog, on the Rocks, where
a separate room, two fiddlers and a proportionate number of nymphs
of the pav&eacute; being engaged, the jovial mariners passed the
night in having what they called &ldquo;a jolly good spree&rdquo;,
the party not breaking up until an hour after sunrise next morning,
when they were fairly dead beat.</p>

<p>Night after night the same sport was pursued by the crew, and
they would fain have had both Rashleigh and the gins to accompany
them; but the former often excused himself, and the latter, who now
lived with the ladies at Colonel Woodville&rsquo;s mansion, could
not be induced to go among the females on the Rocks any more, for
they had been quite frightened by a fight that took place the first
night between two of the <i>ladies</i>, and they used to say,
&ldquo;White man sometimes pretty quiet, but white woman big devil
when they drink fire-water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was nearly a month before Colonel Woodville recovered
sufficiently to see our adventurer. When he did so he returned his
warmest thanks to him as the preserver of three beings so dear to
him that he declared he felt as if he could not have survived their
loss. And the old gentleman, moved even to tears, on concluding,
said, &ldquo;Now, Bealla, if there&rsquo;s anything in the world I
can do for you, you have only got to name it. At any rate, you will
always stop here, and I will take care neither you nor yours shall
ever want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh was much affected, and on looking to Mrs Marby, who
was present, he thought he read in that lady&rsquo;s eye permission
to tell his true history to her father. So he said, &ldquo;I hope,
Colonel Woodville, for your daughter&rsquo;s sake, you will pardon
my having attempted to deceive you, for it was Mrs Marby that
desired me to wait your recovery before I sought to make you
acquainted with my true position. You see before you, Colonel, a
runaway convict, one driven to abscond by such sufferings as rarely
fall to the lot of human beings, but whose colonial career, at
least, has been unstained by the commission of any crime, save that
of attempting his escape from too galling a servitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colonel Woodville looked with amazement upon our exile, but
spoke not for several minutes. At length he said, &ldquo;I never
felt until now how hard it may become to perform a duty. Still,
hard though it be, it must be done. So long as I thought you to be
unstained by crime, my home and all its comforts were free to you;
but now that you have yourself avowed you are a fugitive criminal,
I have but one course to adopt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs Marby here stopped her father&rsquo;s hand as he was about
to ring the bell, saying in tones of the deepest emotion. &ldquo;Oh
papa, what are you about to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My duty, child, to give the runaway up,&rdquo; replied
her father, almost as much agitated as his daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Because he has saved all our lives and confided in
your generosity, will you hand him back to those cruel beings that
tortured him nearly to death before? Fly, Rashleigh! Seek the bush
again! There you can live and there you must strive to forget the
ingratitude of your countrymen; but if ever I can help you, you
shall not reproach a woman with ingratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, lady!&rdquo; replied our exile. &ldquo;I do not blame
the Colonel, for I know he is only about to do his duty. But I
trust, if he should find what I have stated respecting my colonial
career being free from crime is true, that he will intercede to
prevent my being again sent back to the horrid scenes which I
absconded to avoid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel had sunk into a seat. His head was buried in his
hands. He said, &ldquo;Neither man nor woman before could ever
accuse Hugh Woodville of ingratitude. And you, Lucy, know not how
you have wrung your father&rsquo;s heart. But listen to me,&rdquo;
he added, seeing Mrs Marby about to speak, &ldquo;I will do all and
more than Rashleigh requests. A strict investigation shall take
place into his colonial history; and if I find he is not all
corrupt, I will exert my interest to procure his
freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s spoken like my own papa!&rdquo; said the
lady, embracing her sire. &ldquo;And I am sure from
Rashleigh&rsquo;s conduct towards two helpless women that he will
be proved to merit your interference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was now decided that next morning the Colonel should wait
upon the chief convict officer, to whom he was to speak on
Ralph&rsquo;s behalf, the latter giving himself up at the same
time, while Mrs Marby, her sister, and son were to solicit an
audience from the Governor and acquaint him with their rescue.</p>

<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock the next forenoon, our exile repaired to
Hyde Park Barracks, where in a little while Colonel Woodville
arrived on horseback. In a short time the former was summoned into
the presence of the head of his department, who, with ill-subdued
austerity, questioned him as to where he had spent his servitude,
and being replied to, Mr H. ordered an attending official to bring
that volume of the records of convicts&rsquo; punishmerit which
contained the letter &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</p>

<p>On opening this huge and melancholy tome, the chief enquired
what ship our exile had arrived in the Colony by, and being
answered, he turned over the leaves muttering, &ldquo;Ralph
Rashleigh, per <i>Magnet</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Um .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Aye, here he is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. First offence, absconding and
robbery, sentenced death, respited .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hum
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Newcastle, three years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hum
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Aye .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How many times did you get
punished at Newcastle?&rdquo; addressing our adventurer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine times, sir,&rdquo; replied Ralph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A troublesome fellow, I&rsquo;ll be
bound. How many robberies did you commit while you were in the
bush?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one, sir,&rdquo; answered the accused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course not,&rdquo; remarked the haughty official
with a sneer. &ldquo;But how did you live then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh here related the circumstances attending his first
meeting with Foxley and made much the same defence as he had done
at his trial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very pretty and well-got-up story, indeed!&rdquo;
observed the great man. &ldquo;Now, sir, can you bring any tittle
of evidence that you have spoken the truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashleigh related what had happened at Shanavan&rsquo;s and
mentioned how Mrs McGuffin had interfered on his behalf.</p>

<p>Colonel Woodville paid the greatest attention to all that
passed. He took down Shanavan&rsquo;s direction, saying that he
would go thither and ascertain the truth of this statement, while
the Superintendent of Convicts engaged to write to Newcastle
forthwith in order to see under what circumstances our exile had
absconded.</p>

<p>Rashleigh was now ordered to be strictly confined; but the
Colonel interceded to prevent this, saying, &ldquo;He came to me of
his own accord yesterday, Mr H., and told me his tale, which I
rather think is true. So I cannot believe he will run away any
more, and I wish therefore you would oblige me by treating him well
until these enquiries are made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was courteously complied with by the great officer, who
fully marked his estimation of the wide difference between a
colonel and a convict by exhibiting as much fawning servility
towards the former as he displayed haughty scorn to the latter. Our
adventurer went among the other prisoners in the barrack yard, who
all, taking him for a negro, a race that was rather scarce at that
period in the Colony, began to play an manner of tricks with him,
having christened him &ldquo;Sambo&rdquo;. And they annoyed him so
much that at length in self-defence he thrashed two or three of the
foremost.</p>

<p>The same evening Colonel Woodville&rsquo;s footman was sent by
his young lady to acquaint our exile that His Excellency had
received them very kindly but would promise nothing in his behalf
until his colonial character could he ascertained. Mrs Marby
requested that her preserver &mdash; for so she still called our
convict &mdash; would keep up his spirits, as he should not be
forgotten by her, in proof of which she sent him an ample supply of
money and directed if he required anything that he should send to
her for it. Rashleigh was very grateful and requested the man to
bring him some nitrous ether from a chemist&rsquo;s shop, with two
or three other compounds; and having procured these, he set himself
sedulously to work to remove the now useless disguise of his sable
skin.</p>

<p>The application of the lotion he had mixed caused the skin to
peel off; so that the morning after he had first put it on, the
outer coat that had been stained black was all hanging in rags on
every part of him, to the great amazement of his convict
companions, who now called him the piebald man. And it was fully a
week before his person had resumed its former appearance, when the
newly-formed cuticle, though extremely tender at first, appeared to
him much more delicate and pure than ever he could recollect it to
have been before; and it produced such a youthful effect in his
appearance as quite surprised him when he looked at his face in a
mirror.</p>

<p>Ten days had elapsed, during which our exile continually
received. kind messages from Mrs Marby and her sister but began to
sigh for even savage freedom, when one bright morning, the
brightest indeed that had ever beamed for Ralph Rashleigh in New
South Wales, Colonel Woodville rode into Hyde Park Barracks, and
directly after the name of our adventurer was lustily shouted by
the boatswain of the yard.</p>

<p>He was ushered once more into the office of the Chief
Superintendent, who stared at him for a moment and then said,
&ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ralph Rashleigh, sir,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>At the sound of the voice the Colonel burst out laughing and
said, &ldquo;I am sure, so strong are first impressions, I always
expected to see you black! And I can hardly be sure it is the same
man <i>now</i> that saved my daughters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Superintendent then said, using rather a kinder tone than
customary while addressing a convict, &ldquo;You may thank Colonel
Woodville all the days of your life, and you ought to serve him
very faithfully, for he has saved you from going back to the Coal
river to finish your sentence there, and you are now assigned to
him for the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel here remarked that was all the favour he could as
yet obtain from the Governor for our exile, and a promise, if the
latter behaved himself well for one year, that he should be
recommended to the home government for a pardon.</p>

<p>Rashleigh was now directed to repair to the house of the
Colonel; but the latter requested he would await his arrival ere he
saw Mrs Marby, as he had a desire to be present at the first
interview of his daughter with one whom she had always known as a
black, but who was now turned white.</p>

<p>In compliance with this request, it was three o&rsquo;clock
before Ralph was sent for to the drawing-room. having spent the
intermediate hours in the apartment of the stewards, who had by the
Colonel&rsquo;s command provided him with a respectable suit of
clothes.</p>

<p>Mrs Marby, her son and sister were seated with their father when
the latter sent for Rashleigh, and on his entrance the Colonel
said, &ldquo;Ladies, permit me to introduce my new servant to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs Marby looked at the stranger &mdash; so did the others
&mdash; then at the old gentleman, who smiled and said, &ldquo;Have
you no tongue, sire. Pray, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our exile felt that he must look simple enough, so he merely
replied, &ldquo;Ralph Rashleigh, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the little boy ran to him and sought
his favourite resting-place in our adventurer&rsquo;s arms. But the
ladies absolutely screamed with surprise, while Mrs Marby remarked,
&ldquo;Well, to be sure, it ought not to excite any surprise in us
that you have resumed your natural colour again. And yet I shall
always think of my preserver as a black man, such is the power of
habit. However, black or white, you are welcome, for I am certain
you will prove to my papa that my good opinion of you was well
founded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt it, Lucy,&rdquo; here observed the
Colonel, &ldquo;for I have heard another excellent account of his
conduct in trying to save a poor girl from destruction. And I
cannot believe that a person who is amenable to such generous
impulses as have prompted Rashleigh can possess a corrupt
heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, let us hope all our troubles are over
now,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs Marby. &ldquo;Rashleigh shall go and be
overseer on my farm at the Hawkesbury and for his wages shall have
half the profits of the land. Will that satisfy you?&rdquo; turning
to our exile, who of course thanked her for so liberal an
offer.</p>

<p>One thing rather surprised our adventurer, and that was neither
Tita nor Enee could ever be brought to treat him with any
familiarity after his metamorphosis; for though they had seen him
as a white man once before, yet suffering and toil had then so much
embrowned his complexion that it differed but little from the hue
he had so long borrowed. His attempts to enter into conversation in
the native tongue with either were ever after repulsed with distant
respect, and though he saw them repeatedly in subsequent years and
sometimes playfully addressed them in aboriginal terms of
endearment, they would resist all his attempts to lead them into
any lengthened converse, generally saying, &ldquo;You white
gentleman now. No more blackfellow!&rdquo; and depart to attend
upon their mistresses, in whose service both still remain, though
Mrs Marby now resides in India, and Miss Woodville in England.</p>

<p>Shortly after our adventurer&rsquo;s liberation from Hyde Park
Barracks, he went to take charge of an estate on the Hawkesbury,
the property of the former lady, and having received a conditional
pardon for his services to her and her sister, in a few years
removed to New England, then a recently opened pastoral country.
The attention of the Australian settlers having been more directed
to sheep-farming than before, Captain Marby had purchased some
sheep, and Rashleigh was retained to manage them.</p>

<p>The sufferings of his early career in the Colony produced such
an effect of reformation in his mind that he was ever after
respected as a man of scrupulous integrity by all that knew him,
who united sincerely in lamenting his premature death, which took
place in 1844 after the following manner.</p>

<p>A party of hostile aborigines had been long committing
depredations on the flocks of the squatters near Beardie Plains,
and Rashleigh chanced to be visiting a friend there on an occasion
when a breathless messenger entered to acquaint the latter that one
of his shepherds had been killed and the flock driven off by the
blacks. The two superintendents mounted their horses and galloped
away in pursuit. It was nearly sunset ere they overtook the
marauding party, who were encamped, having penned up the sheep in a
rude stockyard formed of houghs. The sable plunderers instantly
took to flight on the appearance of the horsemen, who proceeded to
drive the flock homewards; but as they passed a dense thicket, the
native war-whoop sounded as the prelude to a volley of spears,
seven of which piercing the unfortunate Rashleigh, he fell from his
horse and could only urge his friend to fly and save his life ere
he died. His companion galloped off to the nearest station and
returned as quickly as possible to the spot; but the unhappy Ralph
had long been dead, his remains having been cruelly maltreated by
these bloodthirsty barbarians, whom the mock philanthropy of the
age characterises as inoffensive and injured beings.</p>

<p>Reader, the corpse of the exile slumbers in peace on the banks
of the Barwon, far from his native land. Let us hope that his
sufferings and untimely death, alas, have expiated the errors of
his early years.</p>
