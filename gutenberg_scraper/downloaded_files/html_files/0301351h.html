<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">CHAPTER I.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">MISS GAIL GARRETT, accompanied by her elderly
maid, Catherine, was on her way to dinner at Gavin Dordress'. She
was appearing in Robert Greenfield's play. White Orchids, at the
time, and the party had been arranged for Sunday night to suit
her convenience. She had not the expression of one who is looking
forward to a good time. In the seclusion of the car her beautiful
face was tense and stormy. When the cab stopped, she saw several
men with square boxes hanging around the apartment house door,
and she hesitated before getting out. "Press photographers? Who
do you suppose tipped them off? Gavin wouldn't."</p>

<p>"They always seem to know where you're going to be, Miss,"
said Catherine.</p>

<p>It was a small apartment house, one tenant to a floor, and
there was nobody to open the door of the car. "I don't see why
Gavin lives in such a dump," grumbled Miss Garrett. "He doesn't
have to. Get out first and keep my skirt off the running-board."</p>

<p>Catherine obeyed. Miss Garrett settled the collar of her
ermine coat more becomingly around her neck, and assumed the
famous smile. When she had descended, Catherine closed the door
of the car, and hung behind so that she would not spoil the
pictures. All the photographers tried to crowd in front of the
star simultaneously. "Walk slowly," said one. "Give us a chance."
Another was crying: "Look at me, Miss Garrett. Look at me!"</p>

<p>She smiled, the bulbs flashed; they made way for her, and she
entered the building. As the sober Catherine followed, one of the
young men winked at her broadly. "Hi, Toots!" he said softly.</p>

<p>Catherine glared at him, and all the young men laughed.</p>

<p>The entrance door led directly into a small, square foyer with
a single elevator. The operator was a sharp-featured young white
man with an insinuating smile. As soon as he had closed the
elevator door, he turned around, saying: "Good-evening, Miss
Garrett. Hope it's not a liberty, but I seen you in your play on
Thursday night. It was swell!"</p>

<p>Gail smiled automatically. "Thank you." He went on: "If you
would give me your autograph, Miss Garrett, I would value it
above anything I own." From his pocket he produced a fountain pen
and a little pad. "I can't write with my gloves on."</p>

<p>"Sure you can! Plenty good enough."</p>

<p>"Didn't I give you my autograph before?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss," he said with an open-eyed candour that was a
little overdone. "Must have been one of the other boys."</p>

<p>"Watch your car!" said Catherine nervously.</p>

<p>"That's all right. She stops automatic at the top."</p>

<p>At that moment the car did stop. As the operator still stood
offering her the pen and the pad, Gail took them and scribbled
her name as the quickest way of getting rid of him. "He had a
nerve!" muttered Catherine when the elevator door closed.</p>

<p>"I am the servant of the public," murmured Gail
plaintively.</p>

<p>The door of the apartment was opened, not by Gavin's Hillman,
but a man engaged for the evening.</p>

<p>From the foyer double glass doors led into a sunroom which was
filled with growing plants and had a little fountain playing in
the middle. It was the penthouse which had attracted Gavin to the
otherwise undistinguished apartment house on Madison Avenue. He
had leased it while the building was still going up, and had
designed the big sunroom after his own ideas. One side of it,
filled with glass, made an immense how jutting into the roof-garden.
Gavin was in the sunroom now, mixing a cocktail at a
portable bar. Gail waved her hand to him and turned aside in the
corridor leading to the bedrooms.</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble to show me," she said to the servant. "I
know the way."</p>

<p>In the guest-room Catherine took her mistress' cape, and
handed her what she required from the little dressing-case the
maid carried. Gail studied herself in the mirror with the anxiety
of a beauty of forty-three. Her figure was still willowy, but
after forty, blonde hair, no matter what you do to it, is apt to
betray. She was wearing a virginal dress of white chiffon with
puffs at the shoulders and a skirt shirred in tiers. The tense
look in her eyes displeased her.</p>

<p>"Eye-drops," she said, and Catherine got out the bottle and
the dropper.</p>

<p>"How do I look?" asked Gail when this operation was
finished.</p>

<p>"Lovely, Miss," said Catherine. "White suits you so well!"</p>

<p>"That's what you always say," grumbled Gail, "whether I am
wearing black or red or green."</p>

<p>Catherine primmed her lips a little. It was as if she had
said: "Then why ask?"</p>

<p>"You may go now," said Gail. "Tell Martin I shan't want him
again to-night. I'll taxi home."</p>

<p>"Is it safe?" murmured Catherine.</p>

<p>"If not, somebody will bring me."</p>

<p>When she entered the sunroom Gavin came to meet her. He was
frankly forty-five and handsomer than he had ever been, the lines
in his face were lines of distinction.</p>

<p>"Lovely!" he murmured, picking up her hand and conveying it to
his lips.</p>

<p>Gait's smile became tight. "Only my hand?" she said.</p>

<p>"The servant is still in sight."</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder. "He's gone now."</p>

<p>He pressed her lips lightly with his own.</p>

<p>A flicker of anger crossed Gail's face. "It wasn't always like
that," she said.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to rumple you, my dear."</p>

<p>"Ah, don't make pretences! I can see through you
perfectly!"</p>

<p>"Cigarette?" he said, offering the box.</p>

<p>"No!" She immediately changed her mind, and helped herself.
She turned away, and glancing in a mirror, tried to smooth her
face out. "You can't make me quarrel with you," she said.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to." He was smiling broadly and that angered
her afresh.</p>

<p>She struggled with it. "How about the new play? Is it
finished?"</p>

<p>"All but," he said. "In another week."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"My dear," he protested, "you know I never talk about my work.
Wasn't it Stevenson who said you must never show unfinished work
to anybody?"</p>

<p>"That's not what Stevenson said. He said never show unfinished
work to women or fools."</p>

<p>"Well, I never show it to anybody."</p>

<p>"So you say. Mack Townley has announced that he is going to
produce the play in January."</p>

<p>"That's the usual press stuff. Mack knows no more about the
play than its title: The Changeling."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say he is willing to produce it sight
unseen?"</p>

<p>"Well, after we have been working together for eighteen years
that's not very strange...Cocktail?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>"I have got to the age where I need it."</p>

<p>"This talk of your growing old is all nonsense," said Gail
angrily. "It doesn't fool me."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," said Gavin, holding his glass up to the light.
"It's the cause of the misunderstanding between us. I am getting
old."</p>

<p>She bit her lip.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind that...Am I to have the leading part in the
new play?"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't let's talk business," said Gavin cajolingly.</p>

<p>"I insist on an answer! That's why I came early. You never
give me a chance to see you alone. I have to make my plans as
well as Mack Townley."</p>

<p>"There is no part in it worthy of you," said Gavin. "It's a
man's play."</p>

<p>"There must be a woman in it, or it wouldn't be your
play."</p>

<p>"The only important woman's part is that of a young girl."</p>

<p>Gail flung her cigarette violently on the floor.</p>

<p>"I thought so! I thought so!" she cried. "Why don't you say
right out that I'm too old to act in your plays!"</p>

<p>"Gail, for God's sake!" he remonstrated.</p>

<p>She looked more than her age now. The repulsion that she could
see in his eyes made her worse.</p>

<p>"So this is what I get for having given you the best years of
my life! For having devoted all my art to making you famous! You
owe your fame to me! To me! Do you hear? Where would you have
been if I had not breathed life into the silly puppets in your
plays?"</p>

<p>Gavin's face hardened. "You are a great actress," he said. "I
have never failed to acknowledge my debt to you...But just now
you are making a show of yourself."</p>

<p>"How dare you!" she gasped. "O God, that I should live to hear
a man speak to me like that! I won't bear it! I won't...!"</p>

<p>He seized her wrists to make her listen to him.</p>

<p>"There are strange servants in the flat," he said. "Do you
want to read all this in the gossip columns tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"I don't care! I don't care!" she cried; nevertheless she
lowered her voice. The husky tones were venomous. "I'm not going
to take this from you! I'm not the sort of woman who can be
chucked aside like an old hat. I'll show you up. I'll ruin you! O
God! How I hate you! Smug and sneering as you are..."</p>

<p>Gavin put in mildly: "I never sneered at anybody in my
life."</p>

<p>"You lie! You're sneering now! I could kill you for the way
you've used me! I could kill you...!"</p>

<p>A bell sounded in the distance. Gail caught her breath on a
gasp, and running out, turned towards the guest-room at the end
of the corridor. She passed the manservant on his way to the
entrance door. Gavin poured another cocktail.</p>

<p>Emmett Gundy, the novelist, and his friend, Luella Kip, were
on their way to Gavin Dordress' apartment in a taxicab. Emmett
was bundled up in a blue rumble-seat coat belted around the
waist, the only one of that colour in New York, he claimed. With
the collar turned up and his hat-brim snapped down in front, all
that could be seen of him were his glittering dark eyes, and
small, carefully-trained moustache. Louella was one of the army
of free-lance writers who somehow managed to scrape a living
without ever becoming known to the public. A little, faded woman
with a harassed expression, she looked twenty years older than
Emmett, but they were in fact the same age. Emmett looked her
over critically. "That dress has seen better days," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Well, you know the state of my wardrobe," said Louella
philosophically. "It's the best I have. Mr. Dordress is a
friendly man. He won't care."</p>

<p>"There will be others present."</p>

<p>"If you are ashamed of my appearance you shouldn't have
brought me," said Louella, plucking up spirit.</p>

<p>"Gavin invited you. I merely conveyed the invitation."</p>

<p>"Were you hoping I would decline?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>He did not answer her.</p>

<p>"Gavin will be friendly enough if you flatter him," he said
bitterly. "He doesn't care who it comes from."</p>

<p>"He doesn't need flattery," said Louella. "He's at the top of
his profession."</p>

<p>"You would say that. Just to be disagreeable. You mean that he
makes more money than any other playwright of the day. Money
isn't everything. As a matter of fact, Gavin Dordress hasn't a
spark of original talent. What he has is a talent for publicity.
He understands the politics of the theatre. He knows what wires
to pull. It is Gail Garrett and Mack Townley who have made
him."</p>

<p>"Everybody else says that it was Gavin Dordress who made
them."</p>

<p>"O, I dare say! Nothing succeeds like success. He's got you
going like all the other women. Gavin has made his way step by
step through using women. A male charmer, that's what he is."</p>

<p>"How can you say such a thing?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"But he can't fool me," Emmett went on. "I've known him too
long. I've known him since he was a half-baked frosh in
college."</p>

<p>"You were a freshman, too, then."</p>

<p>"Sure; but I made good. I was famous before I graduated from
college. My first book sold forty thousand copies. It was four or
five years after that before Gavin even got a production. His
first play was a complete flop."</p>

<p>"I hate to hear you talk about him like that," murmured
Louella. "Your oldest friend!"</p>

<p>"Sure, he's my friend. So what?"</p>

<p>"It sounds as if you hated him."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. I see him as he is, that's all. He can't pull
any wool over my eyes." Emmett laughed bitterly. "I've got to
hand it to Gavin for his cleverness. I only wish I could get away
with it. It doesn't pay to be sincere. Tripe is what they want,
and tripe is what they pay for!"</p>

<p>This started Louella's thoughts in a new direction.</p>

<p>"What did Middlebrook say about your novel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He was keen to publish it," said Emmett, "but I told him to
go to hell."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked blankly.</p>

<p>"Because he suggested certain changes that showed he
completely misunderstood it. I took the script and walked
out."</p>

<p>"O, Emmett!"</p>

<p>"Well, do you expect me to prostitute myself to an ignorant
fool like Middlebrook? He's a butcher, not a publisher. He buys
and sells novels by the pound-like the tripe they are!"</p>

<p>"What will you do?" she murmured. "What will we both do?"</p>

<p>"Have you been turned down, too?" he asked sharply. "Your
articles for the Metropolitan?"</p>

<p>"No," she said sadly. "I give them what they want. I have no
talent, so it doesn't matter. But they have reduced my rate.
There are so many younger writers in the field."</p>

<p>"Middlebrook is not the only publisher," growled Emmett.</p>

<p>"But the novel has been turned down so many times!"</p>

<p>"Gavin could help me if he wanted to," said Emmett sorely.
"With a recommendation from him any publisher would bring it
out."</p>

<p>"Have you asked him?"</p>

<p>"Sure, he's read the script."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He intimated that he didn't think much of it. O, very
delicately, of course. Suggested that I try something else. Pure
professional jealousy. He is enough of a writing man to recognise
real talent when he sees it. You can hardly blame him. Said that
novels were a bit out of his line, and offered me a hundred to
tide me over."</p>

<p>"Another hundred?"</p>

<p>"Well, why not? What's a lousy hundred to Gavin? He makes a
hundred thousand a year."</p>

<p>"But it mounts up so. How will you ever pay him back?"</p>

<p>"That's the least of my troubles."</p>

<p>"Emmett," she said earnestly, "let's start in on your script
to-morrow and go over it chapter by chapter..."</p>

<p>"So you think I can no longer write," he said harshly. "You,
too!"</p>

<p>"No, Emmett, no! I believe in you. I shall always believe in
you."</p>

<p>"You think you can teach me how to write!"</p>

<p>"No I have no talent. I have never had any illusions about
that. But I've been through a hard school. I know what the public
wants. At least I know what they say the public wants. If we
could just fix this novel up so you could get an advance on it,
you could bring it out under another name if you were ashamed of
it."</p>

<p>"That would be artistic suicide."</p>

<p>"But you must live! Gavin Dordress will get tired of lending
you money. It's only human nature."</p>

<p>"Is that a way of saying that you're getting tired of helping
me out?"</p>

<p>Louella lowered her head. "Emmett, how can you say such things
to me? After all these years!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't turn on the waterworks," he said
irritably, "or you will look a sight when we get there." He lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p>Louella dried her eyes. After a moment or two she returned to
the charge. "You see, if you could somehow wangle an advance on
this novel, it would give you the time to write something really
fine; something they would have to take."</p>

<p>"I have never allowed anybody to tell me what I ought to
write," he said harshly, "and certainly I'm not going to begin
now. Please change the subject."</p>

<p>"If there could only be some understanding between us, these
troubles would be easy to hear," she murmured. "What would we
care if...if..."</p>

<p>"O, for God's sake, don't get emotional!" he said. "We're
almost there!"</p>

<p>After a silence Louella said very low: "I suppose you look on
me as a drag on you now. If I were strong enough I ought to leave
you."</p>

<p>"So you're talking about deserting me now," he-said. "I
thought we were leading up to that."</p>

<p>She put her hand over his-briefly. "Don't be afraid. I'll
never leave you...unless you wish me to."</p>

<p>The car stopped. "Press photographers?" she said uneasily.</p>

<p>Emmett turned down the collar of his coat. "Gavin Dordress
doesn't often entertain," he said. "Naturally it has news
value."</p>

<p>"How did they know about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I tipped them off if you must know. Won't do me any
harm to be shot as a guest of the great man-...You go in first.
It's me they want."</p>

<p>The photographers glanced indifferently at Miss Kip and Mr.
Gundy. Louella disappeared within the apartment house, while
Emmett lingered on the step as if he wanted a last puff or two at
his cigarette. "Well, boys," he said pleasantly. "Always on the
job!"</p>

<p>"Are you a friend of Gavin Dordress?" asked one.</p>

<p>"The oldest friend he's got," said Emmett with a careless air.
"So what?"</p>

<p>They focused their cameras, and set off the flashes while
Emmett nonchalantly flipped the ash from his cigarette. "What
name?" asked the young photographer who had first spoken. "Emmett
Gundy. Emmett with two t's, please."</p>

<p>"What's your line, brother?" asked another photographer.</p>

<p>Emmet looked at him coldly. "Novelist," he said. "Where have
you been keeping yourself?"</p>

<p>He went on into the apartment house and the four young men
grinned at each other. The one whom Emmett had rebuked asked: "Is
this guy Gundy such a muchness?"</p>

<p>"Nan," said another. "I seem to remember that he wrote a novel
of college life way back before the war. That was before I was
breeched."</p>

<p>"It's always the way with these has-beens."</p>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">CHAPTER II.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">SIEBERT ACKROYD and Cynthia Dordress were
driving up the Avenue from Washington Square in Siebert's little
convertible with the top down. It was a typical November night,
cold, with sparkling stars. Cynthia was enveloped in a beaver
coat, Gavin's gift, and had a chiffon veil around her trim head
to keep her hair in place. When her hair was covered, it
emphasized the clean, pure line of her profile. Siebert was a big
young man with strongly-marked features and a look of resolution
that verged on impatience. Most men, seeing the look in his eye,
addressed him politely. "What a night!" he said. "I wish we could
drive right through until morning, without having to go to that
silly party at your Dad's."</p>

<p>"Dad's parties are not silly," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"By morning we could be in Virginia," murmured Siebert. "You
are sweet enough to eat."</p>

<p>"Long before morning we should be quarrelling." said
Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Well, is it my fault that we always seem to get in a
quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Is it mine?" countered Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Let's not start anything now," said Siebert quickly. "Let me
put the case to you in a matter-of-fact way without any heat or
passion. I am horribly in love with you. I have gone all out. To
be beside you like this is heaven for me. Does that make you
sore?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," she said in a softened voice.</p>

<p>"You have me to make or break," he went on. "You come between
me and everything. Naturally, such a state of suspense is hell on
earth. I am good for nothing."</p>

<p>"That seems a little excessive to me," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Excessive!" he exclaimed. "Do you want a half portion of
love? Do you wish that I wasn't completely in love with you?"</p>

<p>"No...yes...I don't know," she said. "I suppose it would be
better for you it you weren't."</p>

<p>"Do you love me back again?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, in a way."</p>

<p>"In a way!...In a way!" he muttered, pounding a fist on his
thigh. "That's what gets me! How can any warm-blooded person be
in love 'm a way'?"</p>

<p>"Well, it hasn't swamped my intelligence," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Meaning that it has mine."</p>

<p>"Now you're beginning to quarrel."</p>

<p>"No! No!" he said quickly. "I am perfectly cool and
reasonable. I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. I'm head
over heels in love with you, and you love me 'm a way'; why don't
we get married?"</p>

<p>"I've told you so many times..."</p>

<p>"Yes, but always with anger and insults. Consequently it
wasn't convincing. Let's talk it over calmly. We could afford to
get married. My agency is only a small affair, but it's solidly
founded because I only accept authors for my clients who have
something in them, and I do so well for them they will never
leave me. Year by year it is bound to pay better. O, God! to
think of having a home! To come home to you at night..."</p>

<p>"You forgot that I have my job, too, at the clinic."</p>

<p>"I admit I am jealous of your job," said Siebert "You are not
hard-boiled enough to deal with sick people all day. It takes too
much out of you."</p>

<p>"I have the feeling of being useful," said Cynthia. "There is
nothing to beat it."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind if you worked at home. You should write like
your father, and let me be your agent."</p>

<p>"I have no talent for writing."</p>

<p>"Well, I concede the job at the clinic," he said. "We can
afford a good servant. Don't you want a home, too? Wouldn't it be
lovely to meet in our own home after work and be together until
we went to work again?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cynthia a little faintly; "but..."</p>

<p>"Then why don't we do it?" Taking a hand from the wheel he
felt for Cynthia's hand, but she drew it back out of reach.</p>

<p>"This is where we begin to quarrel," she said sadly. "Not
to-night," said Siebert. "You couldn't make me mad."</p>

<p>"This longing to be together," she murmured, "this love,
doesn't last-or at least it changes very much. All older people,
all books tell you that."</p>

<p>"The heck with them!" said Siebert. "I will never change."</p>

<p>"And when it changes, we've got to have something more solid
to go on with."</p>

<p>"Time will take care of that."</p>

<p>"You are simply refusing to face things. That's what brings
couples to Reno."</p>

<p>"Cyn, for God's sake, if we love each other, why go behind
it?"</p>

<p>"You're such a boy!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Is that where I fall short?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I see through you too clearly. You're no wiser than I
am. You never surprise me."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" he muttered. And after a silence, grimly:
"I could surprise you all right, if I didn't love you so damned
much!"</p>

<p>"I shall never marry," said Cynthia, "unless some man wants me
who I feel is bigger and cleverer than myself, and who has
reserves that I cannot enter into."</p>

<p>"In other words, a Gavin Dordress," he said with extreme
bitterness.</p>

<p>"Now you're just being hateful."</p>

<p>"This feeling for your father is ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"It's not ridiculous; it's only unusual. The circumstances are
unusual. It's just a year ago since I saw my father for the first
time. My mother was a foolish, light-headed woman. She was
jealous of his popularity and his fame. Soon after I was born she
divorced him, and regretted it as long as she lived. She kept me
away from him, and he made no effort to see me because, as he has
told me since, he thought the most important thing was not to
come between a child and its mother. Her bitterness against him
was pathological, and naturally I absorbed it. I grew up thinking
of him as a kind of monster.</p>

<p>"When I did go to see him after my mother's death, it was not
with any idea of finding a father; I simply meant to use him as a
means of getting on in the world. And then when I saw him and
talked to him...O, Siebert! I thought I was hiding my hatred and
bitterness, but of course he instantly saw it, though he made
believe not to. He was so funny and human and casual; so honest!
Not like a father at all, but somebody my own age. I felt a
sympathy and understanding such as I had never known in my
mother. Yet he didn't make any effort to win me over, but just
let me alone. All my defences went down immediately. I wanted to
grovel before him then. I felt as if it would take the rest of my
life to make up for the way I misjudged him."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right," said Siebert grudgingly. "Gavin's a
right guy. He's your father. He doesn't conflict with me. I aim
to be your husband." He laughed, not very mirthfully. "A fellow
is heavily handicapped in marrying the daughter of such a
superman, but I'll chance it."</p>

<p>Cynthia did not respond to the laugh. "You don't understand,"
she said. "During the past year my father has given me an ideal
that I-well, I couldn't take anything less than my ideal, could
I?"</p>

<p>Siebert glanced at her in dismay. "Cynthia!"</p>

<p>"You asked for the plain truth," she cried, "and there it
is!"</p>

<p>"Damn Gavin Dordress!" he said savagely.</p>

<p>"I hate you when you talk like that!" said Cynthia, teething.
"You are merely coarse and shallow! You understand nothing!"</p>

<p>"Damn him!" said Siebert. "I hate him!"</p>

<p>Cynthia was near tears then. "You knew him before I came on
the scene. It was at his place that I first met you. You were his
friend."</p>

<p>"Sure, I was his friend. I don't mean to say that Gavin is a
crook or anything. But if he comes between me and you I hate him!
It's a natural feeling and I'm not ashamed of it. Damn him! I
say. I'm no pious saint to turn the other cheek. If anybody hurts
me I'm going to strike back!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you have shown yourself in your true colours!"
said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"God! I'd like to shake you!" groaned Siebert. "I'd like to
shake some sense into your silly head!"</p>

<p>"Really!" said Cynthia.</p>

<p>They drove up in front of Gavin's house. "I suppose we've got
to sit through this damn dinner," he growled.</p>

<p>"I'll see that you're not placed beside me," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Go on in," he said. "I'll find a parking place and
follow."</p>

<p>The bulbs flashed as Miss Dordress crossed the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Hold your head up!" yelled the photographers, but she only
pressed it lower. When Siebert followed a few minutes later, one
said:</p>

<p>"Wipe off that scowl, brother."</p>

<p>"Go to hell," said Siebert. The bulbs flashed anyhow.</p>

<p>"Miss Dordress' escort," said a voice. "What's the name,
please?"</p>

<p>"Julius Caesar," said Siebert.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">CHAPTER III.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">THOUGH he was not a tall man and far from
slender, Amos Lee Mappin stepped out with a good stride, and
little Fanny Parran, clinging to his arm, was obliged almost to
trot to keep up. Fanny's littleness, her dimples, her blonde
curls and her lisp gave her the artless charm of a child, but a
man who assumed to talk baby-talk to her was apt to get a
shock.</p>

<p>She said: "On the level, Pop, you didn't wangle this
invitation for me, did you? Was it Mr. Dordress' very own idea to
ask me?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," said Lee. "He said to me: 'Lee, I'm short of a
female for Sunday night. Do you think that cheeky little
secretary of yours would condescend to accept an invitation?"</p>

<p>"Go on, Pop!" said Fanny. "Mr. Dordress never said that. He is
too dignified."</p>

<p>"You don't know the half of it, my child. Of course I couldn't
swear to his exact words, but that was the sense of it."</p>

<p>"O, dear!" said Fanny after a moment. "I suppose he does think
I'm pretty fresh."</p>

<p>"Well, he's considered a good judge of human nature."</p>

<p>"I didn't tell you what happened that day he came to your
office, Pop. I was ashamed."</p>

<p>"Good God! Did you assault the man?"</p>

<p>"Don't try to be funny!...You see, the Police Commissioner was
with you, and Mr. Dordress had to wait a few minutes in the outer
room. He looked at me in such a friendly way, I mean as if I was
a human being, and not just a piece of office furniture, and we
got to talking. I can't tell you just how it came about-I was
fussed, you see, at being noticed by the great man, and I heard
myself saying: 'Mr. Dordress, I think the women in your plays are
terrible!'"</p>

<p>Lee chuckled. "Not a bad opening. And what did Gavin say?"</p>

<p>"He said: 'I think so too!'"</p>

<p>Lee laughed aloud. "It is undoubtedly to that that you owe
your invitation to dinner. Gavin is fed up with women who throw
fits over him. Strange as it may seem, he's a modest man."</p>

<p>"How kind of him to ask little me!" said Fanny "Do I look all
right, Pop? I won't disgrace you?"</p>

<p>"You do, and you will not," said Lee calmly. "You know that
very well already, so stop insulting my intelligence."</p>

<p>"Some men wouldn't force me to fish for compliments," said
Fanny.</p>

<p>"I'm your boss, not your boy friend."</p>

<p>"Who will be there besides us?"</p>

<p>"I gather it's a kind of class reunion; Yale '13. Mack Townley
and his new wife..."</p>

<p>"That's Beatrice Ellerman. She's beautiful."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Lee.</p>

<p>"Don't you like her, Pop?"</p>

<p>"A man never likes the young wives of his old friends. I think
she's taking Mack for a ride."</p>

<p>"But surely, with his experience he ought to know what he's
doing. After all the beautiful actresses he has hired and fired
in his productions."</p>

<p>"That's just it. Over-confidence. Mack thinks he knows the
sex. A man can't have his guard up all the time. She watched him
until he lowered it, and pinked him! No man is safe."</p>

<p>"You have escaped."</p>

<p>"That's because I know my own weakness. I never try
conclusions with a woman. I run away."</p>

<p>"Have you never been in love?"</p>

<p>"Never! I would as soon toy with a cobra!"</p>

<p>"I think you're lying!...Who else will be there?"</p>

<p>"Emmett Gundy."</p>

<p>"Who's he?"</p>

<p>"Another one of our classmates. He writes novels. At least, I
suppose he still does. I haven't seen anything from his pen
lately. In college Emmett was considered the brightest of the
lot. But he seems to have flashed in the pan."</p>

<p>"Who is asked for him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Years ago Emmett had a girl called Louella Kip.
Sweet little thing, and absolutely devoted to him. I have
forgotten whether he married her. Gavin keeps up with him."</p>

<p>"You four were special friends in college?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pretty close. But in a little gang like that there are
always fellows who pair off. Gavin and I were the closest. We had
been to prep school together. Great days! Seems like yesterday.
How well I remember when we discovered the Phoenician alphabet in
an old book. For years we used to correspond in it."</p>

<p>"Your class was quite a distinguished one," said Fanny, "what
with Gavin Dordress and Mr. Townley and this novelist whoever he
is."</p>

<p>"Gavin Dordress is the only real star we produced."</p>

<p>"O, I don't know, Pop, you're not so dusty. Of course, you
haven't an immense popular following like Gavin Dordress, because
you're a specialist. But you're known, your books sell. You're at
the head of your speciality."</p>

<p>"Crime, eh?"</p>

<p>"I love it!" said Fanny. "How did you come to adopt crime,
Pop?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it's because I'm such a mild man...And of course
Gavin's daughter and her young man will be there," he went
on.</p>

<p>"He's cute," said Fanny.</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Lee. "Six foot two of cuteness!"</p>

<p>"And what lady will Mr. Dordress ask for himself?"</p>

<p>"O, Gail Garrett, of course."</p>

<p>"Why 'of course'? Is that still going on?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"All right. Prude...Gosh! Think of being asked to dinner with
Gail Garrett! I shall be perfectly overwhelmed!"</p>

<p>"Then we will see a phenomenon!"</p>

<p>"That's not very clever...You don't know me, Pop. I mean to be
perfectly quiet to-night and take everything in."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"What's Gail Garrett like, close to?"</p>

<p>"How am I to answer that? A popular star for twenty-five
years. She's not like a mere woman; she's a Broadway
institution."</p>

<p>"She must be human."</p>

<p>"O, quite!" said Lee dryly, "in the wrong way...She won't
cotton to you."</p>

<p>"Why not? Everybody likes me-or almost everybody."</p>

<p>"Because you have twenty years advantage of her, that's
why."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, I'll try not to provoke her."</p>

<p>As Lee and Fanny approached the steps of the apartment house
where Gavin Dordress lived, a photographer said: "Are you going
to Mr. Dordress'?"</p>

<p>"Such was our intention," said Lee in his mild manner. "But if
Dordress is unfair to labour we'll eat elsewhere."</p>

<p>The photographers grinned and set off their flashes. "What
name, please?"</p>

<p>"Amos Lee Mappin."</p>

<p>"O, the detective."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," said Lee. Fanny was delighted to see
Pop getting a little of his own back. "If you must hang a label
on me make it 'amateur criminologist.'"</p>

<p>"Amateur nothing," said the young man, making a note; "famous
criminologist...And the young lady?"</p>

<p>"Miss Frances Parran...You can add that I am the author of The
Fine Art of Murder on sale at all bookstores."</p>

<p>"The heck with it!" said the young man. "You're the guy that
the police consulted in respect to the wash-tub murder. You
solved it for them. That's your news-value."</p>

<p>"Well, just as you like," said Lee. He and Fanny entered the
apartment house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">CHAPTER IV.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">BEA ELLERMAN, now, officially, Mrs. Mack
Townley, was one of the most beautiful women in the public eye,
and the little cushions of self-satisfaction at the corners of
her adorable lips suggested that she knew it. Her tall figure,
her classic features, her soft dark hair, all were perfect, and
she had in addition that all-over lusciousness of aspect that
defies description. Her husband could deny her nothing. She was
wearing a Hattie Carnegie dress of stiff blue silk besprinkled
with tiny gold stars and a fifty-thousand dollar sable coat;
clips, necklace and bracelet of diamonds and emeralds. She sat a
little forward in the taxi, smoothing the wrinkles out of her
gloves, while Mack from his corner watched her with a kind of
agony of desire and frustration. A tall man, Mack, beginning to
grow a little heavy; dark, handsome, self-indulgent face; famous
for his perfect grooming. "We're half an hour late," he
growled.</p>

<p>"What of it?" said Bea. "They won't sit down without us."</p>

<p>"It's damn bad manners!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Nobody's on time. Not important people anyhow. I
aimed to be late to-night."</p>

<p>"Why, for God's sake?"</p>

<p>"Because I wasn't going to let Gail Garrett make an entrance
on me. That old woman!"</p>

<p>"All right," growled Mack. "But please remember that she's
still an important person in my business."</p>

<p>"She's slipping fast. It's ridiculous the way she tries to
hang on to Gavin Dordress. Anybody can sec that he is sick of
her."</p>

<p>"What is it to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. But I hate to see Gavin made a fool of."</p>

<p>"Leave it to him."</p>

<p>"A man is no match for a woman in a situation like this. Gavin
needs the help of another woman in getting rid of Gail
Garrett."</p>

<p>A spasm of anger crossed Mack's face. "Meaning yourself?" Bea
smiled confidently. "You keep out of this!" growled Mack. "I
won't have it!"</p>

<p>Bea leaned over and slid the glass across so that the
chauffeur could not hear. "Don't speak to me like that," she said
coldly. "I am not accustomed to it."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mack. "But you leave Garrett alone, that's
all."</p>

<p>"So she's important to you," said Bea with a disagreeable
smile. "Are you thinking of engaging her?"</p>

<p>"No. But I don't want any feud started."</p>

<p>"Mercy! I'm not going to do anything. I don't have to. The
woman already hates me as much as it is possible for one woman to
hate another."</p>

<p>"All right," growled Mack.</p>

<p>Bea smoothed her gloves. "I'm quite looking forward to this
dinner," she murmured. "I expect to enjoy myself. I suppose Gavin
will put Garrett at his right hand and me at his left. Then we'll
see."</p>

<p>Mack drew his lips back. "All right! But don't forget that a
man can stand only so much!"</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" she said, turning to
him. He refused to answer her. "Are you going to carry on like
this every time a man acts as if he liked me?"</p>

<p>"I don't care about any other man. It's only this man..."</p>

<p>"He's your oldest friend."</p>

<p>"So much the worse."</p>

<p>Bea shrugged elaborately. "I don't see how I can act any
differently. I certainly can't set out to keep Gavin Dordress at
arm's length. He's your partner. It's absolutely essential to
you." Mack said nothing. "I should think you'd be glad to help
him get rid an incubus like Garrett. It would be tragic if he
gave her the lead in his new play. She's finished. Worse than
tragic, it would be bad for business."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mack. "But you keep out of it."</p>

<p>"What's the new play about?" she asked. "I don't know."</p>

<p>"You announced it a week ago."</p>

<p>"That's a routine matter. It's not finished, I haven't seen
it, and he has told me nothing about it."</p>

<p>"Does he intend to give the lead to Garrett?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, are you going to let him give her the part?"</p>

<p>"I never interfere with the casting of a Dordress play."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" said Bea sharply. "Let us face realities.
Do I or do I not get this part?"</p>

<p>"Better wait and see the play."</p>

<p>"That's got nothing to do with it. There has to be a leading
woman's part and I'm going to play it. It's the next step in my
career. I've been planning this for years."</p>

<p>"Was that why you married me?" growled Mack.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, this is business!" she said. "Try to look
at it from my point of view. The new Dordress play will be the
number one event of the season. Naturally I play the lead. If the
play was produced by Mack Townley and Mack Townley's wife did not
get the lead it would be like a slap in the face, it would be
like repudiation."</p>

<p>"The final choice rests with Gavin," said Mack.</p>

<p>"O, I'll take care of him," said Bea confidently. "I'll see
that he wants me to play the part."</p>

<p>Mack's face turned blackish, and his right hand clenched
instinctively. "By God!" he muttered. "By God!..."</p>

<p>Bea, busy with her thoughts, did not notice him. "His giving a
dinner at this time falls just right," she said. "I'll get him to
tell me about the play. I'll clinch the matter to-night..."</p>

<p>Mack broke out in a low, thick voice. "God damn the play! And
Gavin Dordress, tool I'll have nothing to do with it. Let him
find another manager!"</p>

<p>Bea turned her head swiftly and looked at him from between
narrowed lids. "I'm fed up!" stormed Mack. "Fed up, do you hear?
Gavin this and Gavin that; you din his name into my ears from
morning until night. The man has laid a spell on you. Do you
expect me to stand for it? Gavin and Gavin's play! No, by God!
I'm through with him and I'll tell him so to-night. I'm going to
take you away from all this!"</p>

<p>"You don't mean what you're saying," put in Bea quietly.</p>

<p>"All right! You'll see!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she said. "You're at the head of your
profession in New York and London. The first nights of the plays
that you put on are important social events. The people don't
come to see your bright eyes. It's because you're the fashion. If
you drop Gavin Dordress, Maurice Stein will get him, or Sam
Nikodemus, or Gregory McArdle, and he will become the fashion.
You will be handing a great fortune to one of your rivals, while
you drop into second place!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to retire," muttered Mack. "I've made enough. We'll
travel abroad."</p>

<p>"Who, me?" said Bea. She laughed delicately, and paused to
allow the sound to sink in. "Can you see me fluffing from one
European resort to another with nothing to do but exchange gossip
with the other wives and get fat? You can do it if you want. Not
me. I'm twenty-nine years old and I'm not going to quit until I
get to the top of the ladder. Get that. When I agreed to marry
you it was understood that you were to help me in my career. If
you chuck your part of the bargain don't expect me to keep mine.
The day you drop Gavin Dordress I go to Reno!"</p>

<p>"By God! you're a cold-blooded proposition!" muttered Mack,
beaten.</p>

<p>"That doesn't help any," said Bea pettishly. "Really, Mack, I
don't understand you. With all your experience you must know that
in our profession business is all mixed up with personal
relations. You can't separate them. If, in order to get this
part, it is necessary for me to cajole the author, and even
appear make love to him a little, why should you care? You must
have been through it a hundred times before."</p>

<p>Mack shook his head heavily. "No. Never before," said quietly.
"Because I'm in love with you, Bea, And there's something in a
man more powerful than business policy, or making money or
getting ahead of others. A man may keep it under for years, may
never have known that it was there, but it breaks out...it breaks
out...!"</p>

<p>Bea appeared to relent a little. She patted his hand, did not
look around. She was intent on her own thoughts. "I'm crazy about
you!" he murmured. "You came into my life at a time when I
thought all that was past. It is like a fire in me. It scorches.
Everything in me is changed. You can make my life either a heaven
or a hell on earth!"</p>

<p>"Bear!" she said in a fond voice, but her expression had not
changed.</p>

<p>"Tell me you are not so cold-blooded as you make out!"</p>

<p>"Of course I'm not! I was talking business!"</p>

<p>"Tell me you're just a little fond of me."</p>

<p>"Certainly I am. Or I wouldn't have married you."</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Bea!"</p>

<p>She obediently turned her head. "Don't muss me!" she warned.
He kissed her gently, his hand closing hard over hers. "Ouch!
You're hurting my hand."</p>

<p>"Sorry, dear...Let's not go to this dinner," he pleaded.
"Honestly, I don't feel up to it!"</p>

<p>"But we must!" she said. "We're there! We can't back out
now...Besides, the matter may be decided to-night. If I am not
there, Garrett will wangle the part out of him!"</p>

<p>"All right," he said heavily. "But I feel that it is a
mistake."</p>

<p>"But Mack, we understand each other now. If you see me being
very nice to Gavin you will know it is only through motives of
policy."</p>

<p>"You are not nice to him through motives of policy," he said
darkly. "The man excites you. I have eyes."</p>

<p>"I will be extra nice to you after we have left," she said
softly.</p>

<p>"All right. But don't goad me too far while we're there." It
was like a groan. "Don't goad me!"</p>

<p>When they got out of the cab. Mack hung back in order to give
the photographers a fair show at Bea. Bea smiled dazzlingly at
each young man in turn. "Hello, boys! We meet again."</p>

<p>"Couldn't be too often for me, Miss Ellerman," said one. The
bulbs flashed. When Bea passed on they took Mack in turn. When
Mack had disappeared into the apartment house one young man said
to another: "Townley's showing his age."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">CHAPTER V.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">GAVIN DORDRESS and his guests had moved into the
studio after dinner. This was a big room occupying the entire
westerly end of the penthouse with windows on three sides looking
out on the neat box hedges of the roof-garden. The window
curtains were drawn back and coloured lights were strung in the
garden to make a festive effect. At the back of the garden the
wall of the adjoining building rose some fifteen feet higher,
covered with a lattice over which vines were trained in summer.
Indoors, Gavin did not go in for decorative fads: the room was of
no period, but merely comfortable, with deep chairs, mellow old
rugs, shaded lamps and endless shelves of hooks. A fire was
burning.</p>

<p>The setting was right for a good party, and the company highly
ornamental. Gavin, Mack, Emmett and Siebert were tall, handsome
men, and Lee, though his figure was tubby, had a distinctive
head; all the women were beautiful women, each in her own style,
except poor Louella. Nevertheless, it was not a good party; there
was no lack of brittle talk and laughter, but it had overtures
like thunder on the horizon.</p>

<p>Gavin had become aware of it as soon as they sat down to the
table. He could not talk all the time; he was hungry. And as soon
as he fell silent, the ladies at his right and left, with a
too-perfect courtesy and sweetness, began taking shots at each
other. In his mind Gavin consigned them both to the devil. His own
clever Cynthia was silent and distrait. He could do little with
Louella Kip because she was afraid of him. He addressed himself
gratefully to Fanny Parran, whole sharp answers were delightful.
But when he talked to Fanny, both Gail and Bea began to discharge
their darts in her direction, and Gavin, for Fanny's own sake,
felt obliged to leave the girl alone. He was relieved when the
ladies left the table.</p>

<p>The men were no better. Mack Townley had drunk too much;
Siebert Ackroyd's comely young face was white and tight-lipped.
Neither would talk; they glanced at Gavin with barely-concealed
animosity. Gavin inwardly shrugged them off. In the brightly
lighted room Emmett Gundy had the look of a handsome boy who had
started to wither before he was quite mature. His would-be
flattering remarks were curdled with envy. Nursing his brandy
goblet between his hands and sniffing the old Armagnac, he
simpered: "This is the incense of popular success." When he lit a
cigar he said: "I suppose some Cuban admirer presented you with
these."</p>

<p>Only Lee Mappin was his own dry, comical self, and Gavin's
heart warmed to him. His best friend! They talked about college
days, hoping to draw in the other two classmates, but without
success. As soon as the men had drunk their brandies, Gavin led
them to the ladies in the sunroom, hoping for the best. The tight
smiles which greeted them were not reassuring. What a party!
Gavin glanced at Cynthia for humorous sympathy, but Cynthia was
sunk in her own painful thoughts. From the sunroom they proceeded
to the studio. Townley, tall, dark, regal in the starry blue
dress, looked around. "So this is where masterpieces are
produced!"</p>

<p>Gavin said: "I wish I could think so."</p>

<p>"So, is this the first time you have been in this room,
darling?" asked Gail. Alongside Bea she looked a little insipid.
The gathered chiffon dress was too youthful. Gail was
straightening a picture on the wall, and returning a book to its
place on the shelf with a proprietary air that made Bea's eyes
snap. "O, dear no!" said Bea. "I have spent happy hours here. But
every time I enter I have the same feeling of awe."</p>

<p>"It will wear off," said Gail.</p>

<p>"Can I have a Scotch and soda?" growled Mack.</p>

<p>"Surely," said Gavin, pressing a bell. Even the perfect
Hillman was upset to-night, Gavin observed with wry humour when
his servant entered, wheeling the bar. Hillman's lean face was
drawn and grey; his eyes and his hands shook a little when he put
ice in the glasses.</p>

<p>When Gavin took a glass from him he said: "You may go home
with the other men when they finish up. If we want anything we'll
serve ourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir," said Hillman.</p>

<p>After he had left the room Lee Mappin said, just to be saying
something: "Doesn't Hillman sleep in?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gavin. "He's a family man. He has a home of his
own. Servants ought to be allowed to live normal lives like
anybody else."</p>

<p>"O!" exclaimed Bea. "Do you mean to say that after the butler
goes home you are all alone here on this roof?"</p>

<p>"Surely." said Gavin, "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. I've reached the age when I love to be alone."</p>

<p>Fanny Parran was beside him at the moment. "That's hardly
polite," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Well, do you blame me?" Gavin asked, smiling back.</p>

<p>Fanny glanced over the company. "No. If it was me, I'd tell
them all to get the heck out!"</p>

<p>Gavin laughed. "If they were all like you what a good party it
would be!"</p>

<p>"You're pretty nice yourself," said Fanny.</p>

<p>Gail and Bea, observing this low-voiced exchange, moved from
different directions to break it up. Bea said to Gavin: "I don't
think it's right for you to be alone at night. Suppose you were
taken sick!"</p>

<p>"I am never sick," said Gavin. "If I should be, the telephone
is beside my bed."</p>

<p>"You might be too sick to use it."</p>

<p>"If I was unconscious what difference would it make to
me?"</p>

<p>"You don't look as if you were going to be sick," said Bea,
languishing at him, "but men who are so much in the public eye
are always a mark for kidnappers, burglars, cranks, and so
on."</p>

<p>"Anybody who lives in fear might as well die and be done with
it," said Gavin. "The elevator man is there to protect me from
intruders. And up here on the fifteenth floor it is hardly likely
anybody is coming in by the window."</p>

<p>Gail glanced scornfully at Bea: "Anybody who tried to tackle
Gavin would regret it. He is armed."</p>

<p>"Are you?" said Bea.</p>

<p>Gail moved towards an immense flat-topped desk at the south
end of the room. She said: "He keeps a gun here." Pulling out the
middle drawer, she picked up a business-like black automatic, and
exhibited it. There was something terrible in her smile. "You
seem to be familiar with them," said Bea.</p>

<p>"I use a gun like this in my present play."</p>

<p>"Put it away, Gail," said Gavin good-humouredly. "I hate to
see anybody fooling with a loaded gun."</p>

<p>Bea, her face sharpened by curiosity, had joined Gail at the
desk. Gail returned the gun to its place. Bea's eyes ran over the
contents of the wide, shallow drawer. Alongside the gun lay a
pile of typescript with corrections and interlineations in a
quaint and individual hand. At the top of the first page was
typed the title: The Changeling. "O here is the great play!"
cried Bea. "Won't you read it to us, Gavin?"</p>

<p>Gail stood a little away from the desk, watching Bea with a
slight, malicious smile. Fanny Parran and Louella Kip, who did
not know Gavin very well, added their voices to Bea's. "O, do
read it, Mr. Dordress!"</p>

<p>Gavin shook his head. "I never read my own stuff aloud," he
said, obstinately good-humoured.</p>

<p>"Please!" chorused the three women.</p>

<p>Emmett spoke up: "Leave him alone," he said with a sour
smile.</p>

<p>"He hates to be the centre of attraction."</p>

<p>"The truth is," said Gavin, smiling, "I have listened to too
many young playwrights laughing and sobbing over their own
lines."</p>

<p>"But among your intimate friends..." pleaded Bea.</p>

<p>"Shut the drawer, Bea," growled Mack. "Can't you see that he
hates to have his work touched?"</p>

<p>Bea smiled at her husband in a manner that presaged trouble
later, and slowly pushed the drawer in. Returning to Gavin, she
said: "Well, tell us something about the play: tell us the story
of it."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It is always likely to be stood on its
head or turned inside out up to the very moment when it is handed
to the typist."</p>

<p>Fanny, to create a diversion, asked: "Don't you have a
secretary?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, suggesting by his smile that if he could have
one like her he would. "If she's young she tries to vamp you; if
she's old she tries to boss you...I have a girl in occasionally
for correspondence. Writing a play is a slow business. I can type
quite fast enough to keep up with the flow of my ideas."</p>

<p>"Tell us about the people in the play," said Bea
cajolingly.</p>

<p>She seated herself beside Gavin on the sofa and laid a hand on
his arm. From across the room Mack's glowering eyes watched her.
"Not a word," said Gavin, smiling and firm. "It's the only rule I
ever made for myself-and kept."</p>

<p>"Then nobody in the world but you knows what is in that play?"
said Bea.</p>

<p>"Nobody in the world! Mack is taking a big chance in
announcing its production."</p>

<p>"I could still refuse to produce it," growled Mack.</p>

<p>Everybody except Gavin laughed as at a good joke. Bea,
laughing the loudest, said to Mack: "You won't do that!"</p>

<p>"O, I don't know," he growled.</p>

<p>Gavin glanced at him, puzzled. Mack refused to meet his
eye.</p>

<p>It was Emmett Gundy who made the first move to break up the
ill-starred party. He exchanged a meaning look with Louella and
they arose. It was no more than ten o'clock. The inevitable empty
politenesses were exchanged. "Must you go? It's so early."</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Emmett, "but we have promised to join some
friends at the Coq Rouge."</p>

<p>Louella looked as if this was news to her. She had too honest
a face for society. Gavin and Cynthia accompanied them to the
door of the room. "Are you going to be tied up to-morrow, Gavin?"
asked Emmett off-handedly.</p>

<p>"I'll be working on my play. I haven't made any
engagements."</p>

<p>"Could I see you for a few minutes after working hours? I want
to ask your advice about rewriting my novel."</p>

<p>"Surely. Drop in about five."</p>

<p>When they had gone, Gavin said, low-voiced: "Stand by me, Cyn.
I want you to stay until after everybody has gone."</p>

<p>She looked quickly in his face. "Surely, Dad."</p>

<p>Lee and Fanny were on their feet. "Must you go?" said Gavin
with real regret.</p>

<p>"Must!" said Lee. They moved into the foyer and he added:
"Fanny and I thought this would be the quickest way to break it
up. This party was doomed not to prosper."</p>

<p>"Dear old Lee!" said Gavin warmly.</p>

<p>"Why this sudden burst of affection?"</p>

<p>"You shine like a good deed in a naughty world!"</p>

<p>"I've been called many things in my time," said Lee. "But
that's a new one."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry it wasn't a good party," said Gavin to Fanny.</p>

<p>"Ask me again."</p>

<p>"I shall."</p>

<p>When Gavin and Cynthia turned to go back, they met Siebert,
very stiff and good-looking, coming out of the studio. Cynthia,
with the slightest of bows, passed on into the room. "Must you
go?" said Gavin. "I was hoping you would stay on a little."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Siebert, "but I'm sure you and Cynthia want a
little time together."</p>

<p>Gavin was drawn to this young man. "It's a long time since you
have dropped in on me, Siebert. When are we going to have another
game of chess?"</p>

<p>"Chess is all very well for you," said Siebert, "but I have my
way to make. I can't take the time for it."</p>

<p>"Well...I'm sorry," said, Gavin. "You had the makings of a
good player. Goodnight, Siebert."</p>

<p>Siebert went on to get his things.</p>

<p>Gavin looked weary when he re-entered the studio. In the
beginning he had exerted himself to make things go; now he didn't
care. Thus, when Mack growled: "Get your things, Bea," he said
nothing.</p>

<p>Bea made no move. "It's only ten o'clock," she said. "Gavin
will think we're not enjoying ourselves. Sit here, Gavin."</p>

<p>Gavin sat beside her. Mack left the room. Bea looked after him
indifferently, and rattled on: "You and Cynthia must dine with us
very soon, and that handsome fellow, Siebert...and, of course,
you, Gail."</p>

<p>"Thanks." said Gail.</p>

<p>She was sitting opposite them with a ghastly fixed smile. She
was squeezing a handkerchief in her hand, and she had bitten off
all the lip-stick from her lower lip without knowing it. Bea,
flaunting her beauty and freshness, said: "What night shall it
be, Gavin? I want to make this a very special occasion."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not make any engagements until I get the play off
my hands; four or five days; a week at the outside."</p>

<p>"Very well, let me know. I want to consult you about the other
guests..."</p>

<p>Bea's flow was checked by the return of Mack. He had her coat
over his arm. "Come on," he said. Bea saw that she could not defy
him without creating a scene and got up slowly. "Husbands are so
peremptory!"</p>

<p>All five of them passed out into the foyer, and stood there
while Mack helped his wife into her coat. Gail made no move to
get her things. "Can we put you down anywhere, Gail, dear?" said
Bea.</p>

<p>"Thanks, darling. I'm not quite ready."</p>

<p>Bea's eyes glittered. She glanced across the sunroom. "How
lovely the garden looks under the lights!" she said. "Show it to
me, Gavin. It won't take a minute."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Gavin woodenly.</p>

<p>They crossed the sunroom. The key to the garden door hung
alongside the door-frame. Gavin opened the door and they went
out, closing the door behind them. The three waiting in the foyer
could see them dimly through the glass. Gavin was calling Bea's
attention to something off to the South. Bea slipped her hand
cosily under his arm, and they passed out of sight.</p>

<p>Gail and Mack continued to stare out through the glass. They
had forgotten where they were. Cynthia hastened to make
conversation: "Dad consulted a man up in the Bronx Botanical
Gardens about planting the sunroom. Everything looks as if it was
growing naturally, doesn't it? Some of the plants are very
rare..."</p>

<p>Neither Gail nor Mack paid any attention and her voice trailed
away. It was so quiet they could hear sounds from the pantry
where the servants were washing up. Moment followed moment,
increasing the strain. Finally Gail said in an unnaturally sharp
voice: "I'd like to see the garden, too."</p>

<p>She crossed the sunroom and went out, leaving the door open.
Outside she started to run. Mack watched her for a moment,
glowering, then silently went after her. Cynthia, after
hesitating painfully, followed Mack.</p>

<p>They found Gavin and Bea standing beside the parapet at the
east end of the roof. Behind them a wasted moon was rising over
the river, and the pinpoint lights of Queensborough stretched
away to infinity. When Cynthia came up to the group, Gail was
saying shrilly: "You better look after your wife, Mack! She needs
it!"</p>

<p>"Don't want your help," growled Mack.</p>

<p>"She's loose! She's common! She's cheap!" shrilled Gail. "See
her trying to brazen it out..."</p>

<p>"Gail, for God's sake, be quiet!" said Gavin. His voice was
weary with disgust.</p>

<p>"Come in!" growled Mack to Bea, with a jerk of his head
towards the house door.</p>

<p>"You have no right to speak to me like that!" retorted Bea.
"Am I your servant?"</p>

<p>Mack raised his voice slightly. "Come in!" he repeated. "Or
you'll get worse."</p>

<p>Bea turned to Gavin. "You hear, he threatens me! He's mad! It
is dangerous for me to go with him!"</p>

<p>"He is your husband," said Gavin coldly.</p>

<p>That was all that was said, but the voices, that is, three of
the voices, were so charged with venom as to make the youngest
person present feel physically sick. Such a scene was new to
Cynthia. Somehow or other they found themselves in the sunroom
again. Gavin drew Cynthia's arm under his. She felt better when
she saw his face. It was weary and disgusted, but there was no
loss of dignity there.</p>

<p>Mack made straight for the door of the apartment. He held it
open for Bea to pass through. She, having recovered herself
partly, took her time about it. "I'm going," she said to Gavin,
"not because he orders me to, but because I want to end a painful
situation. Good-night, Gavin. Good-night, Cynthia, dear.
Goodnight, Gail." She went out with a nonchalant air. Gail
sneered.</p>

<p>Mack, preparing to follow Bea, looked furiously at Gavin.
"Give your play to whoever you like," he said. "I'm through!"</p>

<p>"That suits me," said Gavin levelly. The door slammed.</p>

<p>Gail, with a grotesque attempt to recover her usual sugary
manner, said: "Cynthia, darling, I want a few words alone with
Gavin. You will excuse us, I'm sure. Such old friends!"</p>

<p>Cynthia looked at her father, then at Gail. She said coolly:
"I'm sorry, but Dad just said he wanted to speak privately to
me."</p>

<p>Gail caught her breath, and looked at Gavin. "Is this
true?'"</p>

<p>"You heard her," said Gavin.</p>

<p>Gail could scarcely articulate now. "So! So! You put this
child ahead of me now! You're using her as a shield! This chit!
Don't think that I can't see through your pitiful
evasions..."</p>

<p>Cynthia ran away down the corridor. Gail was still storming
when she returned with the ermine coat over her arm. "Your coat,
Miss Garrett."</p>

<p>"Am I being put out of the house now?" cried Gail. "Gavin,
will you stand for that? Do you put me out of your house?"</p>

<p>Her face was so distorted with rage neither Gavin nor Cynthia
could bear to look at her. Since she refused to put her arms
through the sleeves of her coat, Cynthia hung it over her
shoulders. Gavin opened the door. "Are you going to let me go
down into the street alone?" cried Gail. "Me? There is no doorman
in this miserable house to find me a taxi!"</p>

<p>Gavin hesitated. "Hillman is still here," said Cynthia. She
ran into the pantry and fetched the butler out. "Hillman," said
Gavin, "go down with Miss Garrett and get her a cab."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry for this, Gavin!" cried Gail. "Remember, I
warned you!...I warned you!"</p>

<p>Gavin closed the door, and he and Cynthia looked at each
other. "What a mess!" he said wearily. "My child, I'm so sorry
you had to be let in for it!"</p>

<p>"It won't hurt me," said Cynthia. "I'm not made of glass." She
laughed shakily. "You are too attractive to the ladies, Dad."</p>

<p>"It's not my attractiveness," said Gavin, "but something more
sordid. These women are fighting to get a part in my play."</p>

<p>"Which one gets it?"</p>

<p>"Neither."</p>

<p>They dropped on a sofa alongside the fire. After a while
Cynthia said: "I'd better go, too. I feel done up, and so do
you."</p>

<p>"Don't go," said Gavin. "Why don't you stay all night?"</p>

<p>"I haven't my things."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd come here and live," he said wistfully. "It
would be so jolly to have you in the house."</p>

<p>She shook her head firmly. "I love my independence. And so do
you. We can be friends without living together."</p>

<p>"I shall never give another party," said Gavin. "Why do people
give parties?"</p>

<p>"Don't say that."</p>

<p>"Even Hillman. What the devil do you suppose is the matter
with Hillman?"</p>

<p>"He confided in me a little yesterday," 'said Cynthia. "He is
married to an ambitious wife. She twits him all the time because
he's only a servant. She tells him that their children are old
enough now to be ashamed of him. She wants him to give up his job
and do something for himself. Hillman tells her he has no money.
She says if he would use his wits he wouldn't be without
money."</p>

<p>"Poor devil!"</p>

<p>Cynthia stood up. "I must go, Dad."</p>

<p>"Wait! What's the trouble between you and Siebert?"</p>

<p>Cynthia turned away her head. "Ah, don't ask me! He's
impossible! Always pestering me to marry him!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you a little in love with him?"</p>

<p>She looked at the floor. "Yes," she murmured. "That's just the
trouble. He's so good to look at...and such a boy! But I can't
respect him, Dad."</p>

<p>"Siebert's a good lad; sound at heart; able, too."</p>

<p>"I know. I know. But he has no imagination, none of the finer
qualities."</p>

<p>"What of it? These sensitive, imaginative creatures are not
easy to live with, Cyn. Siebert is very much of a man."</p>

<p>"You can say that about him!" she said in surprise. "You ought
to hear the way he abuses you!"</p>

<p>Gavin laughed. "Jealous, eh? I seem to be in everybody's
way!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that!" cried Cynthia, putting her arms around him.
"You are my ideal!"</p>

<p>"Ideals are all very well," said Gavin, smoothing her hair.
"But I advise you to think twice before sending Siebert away. I
suppose he flies into a rage and uses bad language. That's a
manly weakness, my dear. If you married him his ridiculous
jealousy would disappear."</p>

<p>"No! No! No!" said Cynthia. "He is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Well...I'm sorry."</p>

<p>He kissed her good-night at the door. "We'll feel better in
the morning, Cyn."</p>

<p>"Will you go to bed now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'll read a little while to compose my mind. I'll call you
when I wake."</p>

<p>"Do, dear."</p>

<p>Hillman said: "Shall I get you a cab, Miss?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I am accustomed to going about by myself."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Miss."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Hillman."</p>

<p>In the elevator the boy Joe asked her with a sharp look: "Is
the party over, Miss?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, everybody's in the house now except the real late
birds. If I'm not wanted for a couple of hours I could get a
sleep."</p>

<p>As Cynthia waited on the corner for a taxi, an odd-looking
figure passed by, a tall man with heavy, stooping shoulders, a
foreigner by the look of him. An old, yellowish overcoat as
shapeless as a bag hung from his shoulders without touching him
anywhere and he wore a leather aviator's helmet that fastened
under his chin. He kept his head down as he walked; he had on
thick glasses and had an uncanny way of looking around them. At
the moment Cynthia scarcely noticed him, but the strangeness of
his appearance was impressed on her subconsciousness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">CHAPTER VI.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">CYNTHIA lived in a small walk-up apartment,
parlour, bedroom and bath, in a converted dwelling in West
Fifty-fifth Street, not half a mile from Gavin's place. She let
herself in and threw her coat on a sofa. Her little living-room
no longer seemed the same haven of peace and freedom. One of the
first things that caught her eye was a framed photograph of
Siebert on her desk. She thrust it face down in a drawer. After a
while she drifted back to the desk, and taking out the
photograph, looked at it a long time. She glanced at the clock;
10.50. After painful hesitation, she picked up the telephone and
dialled a number. Her expression suggested that she had no
intention of humbling herself, but was willing to give Siebert a
chance to say he was sorry.</p>

<p>He did not answer. She hung up and going slowly into the
bedroom started to undress. For a long time she lay open-eyed in
her bed waiting for the telephone. It did not ring. When she
finally slept with wet lashes on her cheeks, her sleep was broken
by bad dreams. Distorted faces formed and dissolved in front of
her; Gail Garrett; Mack Townley; the envious Emmett Gundy; the
sharp-featured elevator boy; even Hillman, weak, desperate and
furtive.</p>

<p>She was awakened by a roaring that seemed to be inside her
head. It resolved itself into the ringing of the telephone bell.
She glanced at the bedside clock; 7.50. Her face cleared as if by
magic, and she ran into the next room with shining eyes.</p>

<p>But it was not the deep voice that she longed to hear, and her
face fell. This was a man's voice so distracted and broken she
did not recognise it. "Miss Dordress?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Hillman, Miss...O, Miss!...There has been an accident...I
don't know how to tell you...!"</p>

<p>An icy hand was laid on Cynthia's breast. "My father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss...Come quickly!"</p>

<p>"What has happened?" cried Cynthia. The frantic Hillman had
already hung up. She threw on her clothes anyhow and got a cab at
the door. In five minutes she was at the door of the Madison
Avenue apartment. Short as the time was, a thousand horrors had
suggested themselves. She fought them off by saying to herself:
Hillman is a fool! He exaggerates the trouble.</p>

<p>There was a different boy on the elevator. This was Harry,
whom Cynthia liked. "What has happened?" she asked him
breathlessly.</p>

<p>He turned away his head. "I don't know, Miss. They'll tell
you."</p>

<p>He is afraid to tell me! she thought; it is the worst! Hillman
opened the door of the apartment. His eyes were red-rimmed, his
hands shaking. At the sight of her his eyes filled with weak
tears. "O, Miss...!"</p>

<p>"What has happened?" cried Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Your father..." He was unable to go on. Cynthia turned to run
to her father's bedroom. "Not there. He's in the studio." When
she turned in that direction, he caught hold of her. "You mustn't
go in there."</p>

<p>Cynthia, frozen, dropped weakly in a chair, staring at the
man. "Is he?...is he?...am I too late?"</p>

<p>Hillman nodded. "Mr. Dordress has passed away."</p>

<p>"No! It can't be so!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss. Many hours ago."</p>

<p>Cynthia covered her face with her hands. She did not weep.
"Send for Mr. Mappin," she whispered.</p>

<p>"He's on his way, Miss."</p>

<p>When the bell rang Cynthia turned her haggard face to see who
it was. Two or three-important-looking men pushed in as if they
had a right to enter. One was in uniform with a lot of gold
braid. Police! Several underlings followed, carrying
paraphernalia of different sorts. "This way, please, gentlemen,"
stammered Hillman, leading them towards the studio.</p>

<p>"What are the police doing here?" whispered Cynthia.</p>

<p>When the bell rang again she went to the door herself. It was
Lee Mappin. He took her in his arms. "My dear, dear child!"</p>

<p>She drew herself away. "Never mind me. Go in there. Lee. In
there! And for God's sake come and tell me what has
happened."</p>

<p>She dropped back in the chair and waited like a woman of
stone.</p>

<p>When Lee entered the studio he saw the body of his friend
lying huddled on the floor near the fireplace. He drew a long
breath to steady himself. Gavin's right arm was outstretched and
near it lay a black automatic as if it had been knocked from his
hand as he fell. Under his head a pool of blood had spread out on
the parquet floor and coagulated. The wound itself was hidden.
Gavin's eyes were fixed and staring. Near him a police
photographer was kneeling on the floor, preparing to take a
picture of the body. Lee looked around the room. The set-up was
familiar to him; Captain of the precinct; Lieutenant of
detectives, another detective, medical examiner, fingerprint
expert and so on.</p>

<p>Captain Kelleran knew him. "Good God! Mr. Mappin, what are you
doing here!" he exclaimed. "Gavin Dordress was my oldest friend,"
said Lee.</p>

<p>"I didn't know that. You have my sympathy."</p>

<p>"When did this happen?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"About nine hours ago. Say ten-thirty or eleven last night.
There is nothing here to interest us professionally. Clearly a
suicide."</p>

<p>"He had everything to live for," murmured Lee.</p>

<p>"He left a letter," said the Captain, handing Lee a manilla
sheet that appeared to have been torn off a pad on Gavin's desk.
"I take it that's his handwriting?"</p>

<p>Gavin as a young man had taken the trouble to form a highly
decorative hand. The quaintly-formed characters were inimitable.
"Undoubtedly," said Lee. He read the letter with a masklike face.
"Do you recognise the gun?" asked the Captain.</p>

<p>Instead of answering directly, Lee went to the desk at the
other end of the room and pulled out the middle drawer. He said:
"Gavin kept his gun here. It's gone. It was of the same style and
calibre as that on the floor. We may assume that that is his
gun."</p>

<p>"So you see..." said the Captain, spreading out his hands.
"We'll check fingerprints on the gun to make sure. There are
powder burns around the wound."</p>

<p>There was something else about the drawer that made Lee look
thoughtful. He returned to the fireplace. The fire had been out
for many hours. On top of the dead embers lay the charred
remnants of many burned papers. One sheet had partly fallen out,
and the top of it was unburned. Lee could read a typed title: The
Changeling. So Gavin had burned the new play before killing
himself. This was no business of the policeman's and Lee said
nothing about it.</p>

<p>Taking the letter, Lee returned to Cynthia in the foyer. She
raised her questioning eyes to his, and he said simply: "Gavin
has left us."</p>

<p>"What was it?" she whispered. "Heart?...Why the police?"</p>

<p>"He took his own life."</p>

<p>Cynthia, wildly staring, stammered: "No, Lee, no!"</p>

<p>He put a hand on her shoulder. "You must face it, my dear. He
had the right to leave us if he wished to."</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed. "But he couldn't have done it!...Last night
when I left him there was no such thought in his mind. He was
looking ahead to our future..."</p>

<p>"Then it was a sudden impulse."</p>

<p>"No, Lee! Dad was not a creature of impulse. He was
stable!"</p>

<p>Lee handed her the letter. A spasm of pain crossed the girl's
face at sight of the decorative characters.-There was neither
salutation nor signature. She read: "I have reached the summit of
my life-indeed I appear to have passed it. I have done my best
work. There is nothing before me but a slow decline in power. I
wish to be remembered by my best, and so I choose to write the
End while I can do it firmly. Men live too long.</p>

<p>"What are the thoughts of a man who pauses on the brink of the
unknowable? I have often wondered. Now I know. He thinks of his
childhood; the first tree climbed; the first little creek that
was swum from bank to bank. Those were the biggest successes of
life. Later he remembers the words that remained unspoken; the
wine untasted; the kisses that were not given. They are the
sweetest. He hears the first sleepy notes of awakening birds, and
sees a lake gleaming in the dawn. And always the stars, his
unchanging companions, who mocked him when he was set up, and
comforted him when he was cast down.</p>

<p>"This is the last thought: Man is not worthy of his beautiful
earth. The worst that has been said about man's life is true; it
is cruel, ugly and evil-but who would give up the privilege of
sitting in on so magnificent a show? I have seen it, and I leave
the theatre without regret."</p>

<p>Cynthia's tears were falling fast before she came to the end.
Some moments passed before she could speak. "Was this all?" she
whispered. "Nothing...not one word for me?"</p>

<p>"That is all," said Lee. "He would not leave me without a
word!" she cried. "Lee, I will not believe that he killed
himself! There are people who wished him dead."</p>

<p>"It must be faced," said Lee. "There is the gun, the powder
marks. The letter sounds like Gavin."</p>

<p>"It sounds like him," she agreed; "but it has a made-up sound.
It is like something he might have written in a play."</p>

<p>"Cynthia, my dear, you are only tormenting yourself!"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be tormented?" she burst out. "He would not
leave me without a word...Listen, Lee, we came close to each
other for a moment last night as I was leaving. There was nothing
much said. We understood each other without speaking. You cannot
mistake such a moment. After that he could not have left me
without a word. I do not believe he killed himself. I will never
believe it....Look at this letter! Notice how in the first line
he has changed "apex" to "summit"; down below he wrote "most men"
and then crossed out "most," and changed "abyss" to "unknowable."
Would a man be thinking about literary effect when he was about
to die?"</p>

<p>"Habit, perhaps," said Lee. "He wrote the letter. How else can
it be explained?"</p>

<p>"It sounds like something out of a play," insisted Cynthia.
"Let us read the new play and see if there is not a clue
there."</p>

<p>"He burned it," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Burned it? Why should he?"</p>

<p>"Well, he implies in the letter that he was dissatisfied with
it."</p>

<p>"Implies! Implies! Words can imply so many things! He doesn't
say that he was dissatisfied with it. He told me he thought it
was good."</p>

<p>"Sometimes there is a reaction. Every writer knows what that
is like."</p>

<p>Cynthia was not listening. "Lee, suppose that this letter is
something that Dad wrote for his play. He was always making
changes and inserting new pages either in type or longhand. The
murderer found it. He would then be obliged to destroy the rest
of the play, wouldn't he, in order to conceal the fact that this
had been taken from it?"</p>

<p>"That is too far-fetched!" objected Lee.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, far-fetched?"</p>

<p>"It is incredible that the murderer-if there was a murderer,
should have stumbled on something that came so pat to his
needs."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he read the play first and this letter suggested the
plan of the murder."</p>

<p>"Gavin would allow no one to read the play."</p>

<p>"There were plenty of people who were crazy to get a line on
it. Hillman may have betrayed Dad while he was out. Hillman..."
She pulled up suddenly, and her eyes widened.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Hillman has something on his mind."</p>

<p>"Naturally, after..."</p>

<p>"O, this began many days ago."</p>

<p>"Where does Hillman live?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's in Gavin's address book." Captain Kelleran
came out of the studio with his men tailing after him. He bowed
to Cynthia with grave sympathy and drew Lee aside. "There is
nothing in this case for the police," he said. "With an ordinary
magnifying glass we could identify Mr. Dordress' fingerprints on
the gun without the necessity of taking photographs. The medical
examiner will hand you the necessary permit for burial, and we
will trouble you no more. Please convey my sympathy to the young
lady."</p>

<p>"Thank you. She will appreciate it, Captain." Lee shepherded
them out through the door.</p>

<p>When they were left alone Cynthia came and wound her arms
around Lee's neck. "Thank God, I have you!" she said. "Bless your
heart!" he murmured. "Have I convinced you that Gavin did not
kill himself?" she asked, looking deep into his eyes. "No, my
dear," he said gravely. "So far this is only a surmise on your
part. We must have evidence."</p>

<p>"Then look for it! Look for it!" she said, urging him with her
hands. "Before anything is moved or changed, before any one else
comes. You can lay bare the truth. Lee, if anybody can."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," he said.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">CHAPTER VII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">THE bell rang. "This will be the reporters,"
said Lee.</p>

<p>"Don't let them in!" exclaimed Cynthia in horror.</p>

<p>Lee stopped Hillman on his way to the door. "Wait a minute."
He said to Cynthia: "We can't keep them out, my dear. I'll take
care of them. You go into the guest-room. You should stay here
for the present, because you can't protect yourself from
intruders in your own place. I'll send for Fanny Parran to be
with you."</p>

<p>"I don't want anybody."</p>

<p>"Fanny is a woman in a thousand. She'll act as if nothing was
the matter."</p>

<p>"I want to be with Dad," said Cynthia piteously.</p>

<p>Lee thought of the black stain under Gavin's head. "You shall
be," he promised. "When I get these people out of the house."</p>

<p>Lee took the precaution of locking the studio door and
pocketing the key. A swarm of reporters and photographers was
then admitted. More were arriving constantly. Lee told them a
plain story of what had happened, and let them copy Gavin's
letter. He answered every question that he considered a proper
one, but nipped in the bud every attempt to make a sensational
mystery of the case. That section of the press which thrives on
sensation was disappointed. One or two of the men from the more
unscrupulous sheets edged to the door of the studio and tried it.
Lee said: "That's all now, boys. I've got a lot to do. I'll
receive you again at eleven o'clock to give you anything that may
break in for the later editions."</p>

<p>They left.</p>

<p>Fanny arrived, saddened and wondering. Lee said to her: "I
rely on you. Keep your ears open and your mouth shut. I want you
to stay with Cynthia for the present. Keep her occupied if you
can. There must be family letters to write and so on. She is
under the delusion that her father was murdered, and we must
appear to humour it."</p>

<p>Fanny's eyes widened. "You don't think that..."</p>

<p>"Please God there's nothing in it!" said Lee. "One can face
the fact that Gavin left us because he wished to go, but if he
was taken...I...Read that!" he said, handing her the letter.
"What does it suggest to a woman's intuition?"</p>

<p>Fanny read the letter, and considered. "It sounds," she said
slowly, "-what shall I say? Just a little highfalutin for a man
so simple and natural as Mr. Dordress."</p>

<p>Lee looked at her in surprise. "That's what Cynthia said. I
hope you're both wrong. Go to her."</p>

<p>Lee locked himself in the studio for an hour. When he came out
his mild face was stern and grey. Meeting Hillman drifting around
the foyer like a lost soul, he said: "You may telephone for the
undertaker now. Let him arrange the body suitably on a couch in
there, and see that the floor is washed, so that Miss Cynthia may
see her father before he is taken away."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Lee went on to the two girls in the guest-room. When Cynthia
saw his face she cried out: "What have you discovered?"</p>

<p>He hesitated. "Tell me everything that is in your mind," she
pleaded. "Treat me like a man. It is the kindest thing you can
do. What I cannot bear is to be kept in the dark."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Lee. "What I have discovered raises a doubt in
my mind that Gavin killed himself."</p>

<p>"I knew he wouldn't leave me without a word," murmured
Cynthia.</p>

<p>"What did you find?" asked Fanny.</p>

<p>Lee still had Gavin's letter in his hand. He said: "The yellow
pad from which this sheet was presumably torn was not lying on
Gavin's desk when we were in the room last night. The inference
is that he got it out later. If you run your finger lightly along
the top of this paper you can feel microscopic pieces of glue
clinging to it. When I placed this sheet on top of the pad and
examined the edges under a strong glass, I saw that these specks
of glue do not fit with the glue that remains on the pad. In
other words, this is not the last sheet that was torn off that
pad. As a matter of fact, the pad was twice as thick as it is at
present when this sheet was torn off it."</p>

<p>The eyes of both girls widened when they took in the
significance of this. "Also," Lee went on, "Gavin's fountain pen
was on his desk. I find that he uses the sort of fluid that
writes blue and darkens with time. When I made tests with the ink
I saw at once that this letter was not written last night. It is
several days old, possibly more than a week."</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Wait! It is possible that Gavin may have written this several
days ago and have been keeping it."</p>

<p>Cynthia shook her head. "He could not have had any such idea
when he was talking to me last night."</p>

<p>"A forgery?" suggested Fanny.</p>

<p>"We may dismiss that possibility," said Lee. "Gavin certainly
wrote this letter."</p>

<p>"For some other purpose," said Cynthia obstinately.</p>

<p>"You may be right, but until we have further evidence, we must
still reckon on the possibility of suicide...There is something
else."</p>

<p>"Yes?" asked Cynthia anxiously.</p>

<p>"Six little marks on Gavin's forehead, as if he had struck
against something, not hard. I don't know yet what they signify.
The police were so sure it is suicide they paid no attention. I
have made a sketch of the marks."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" asked Cynthia.</p>

<p>"I found Gavin's address book, but the little book bound in
green Morocco which he entered ideas for plots, scenes and
characters is missing."</p>

<p>"It was always in Gavin's desk," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"What happened last night after Fanny and I went home?" asked
Lee.</p>

<p>Cynthia described what had taken place word by word, as
closely as she could remember. She cried out passionately: "It is
easy to see who..."</p>

<p>Lee held up his hand. "Wait! My first rule is: Never be
satisfied with the obvious explanation. We must always have the
unknown quantity in mind. If there is a murderer it may be
somebody we never heard of."</p>

<p>"If, if, if," murmured Cynthia. "You will drive me crazy with
your ifs!"</p>

<p>Lee smiled at her. "Bless your heart!...We don't know all the
circumstances of Gavin's life."</p>

<p>"If you are implying that there is anything
discreditable..."</p>

<p>"I'm not," said Lee; "but if there is, what difference would
it make to those who loved him?"</p>

<p>Tears gathered in Cynthia's eyes. "I noticed that there was a
certain coldness between you and Siebert last night," Lee
hazarded.</p>

<p>Cynthia told him briefly what had happened.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door. It was Hillman to say that Mr.
Kinnaird was asking for Mr. Mappin. Kinnaird was Gavin's
attorney, a young man. Lee went out to meet him. The two gripped
hands. "Is there anything I can do?" asked Kinnaird.</p>

<p>"Answer a question," said Lee. "You have his will?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it proper for you to tell me the provisions?"</p>

<p>"Surely. You and I are named as executors. It's a brief will.
He leaves everything to his daughter except for two bequests.
Fifty thousand dollars to the Authors' League Fund, and five
thousand to his servant, Robert Hillman."</p>

<p>"So," said Lee.</p>

<p>"You don't suspect that..."</p>

<p>"I suspect nothing," said Lee, "but I must look into
everything."</p>

<p>The two men discussed the various measures that must be taken
in respect to Gavin's death. When the lawyer had gone, Lee
addressed Hillman in his mild way. "Hillman, tell me about Mr.
Dordress' movements yesterday."</p>

<p>The gaunt man-servant was an abject figure. His hair was
disordered, and the neat black bow had crept around to the side
of his collar without his being aware of it. A natural grief for
his master was hardly sufficient to account for the frantic look
in his eyes. Lee observed that he had continually to pause and
swallow his saliva. "Mr. Dordress was working very hard on his
play, sir. He was in the studio from breakfast until lunch, and
again after lunch. He went out for a little while in the
afternoon, but he was home by three and at work again. He worked
until it was time to dress for dinner."</p>

<p>"Did he say where he was going when he went out?"</p>

<p>"To the bank, sir."</p>

<p>"Any place else?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say, sir."</p>

<p>"Any visitors yesterday?"</p>

<p>"There are always callers, sir, but I had strict orders to say
he was out. He saw only one man. Mr. Alan Talbert."</p>

<p>"Who's he?"</p>

<p>"A young gentleman; a playwright, I believe. He addressed Mr.
Dordress as 'The Master.'"</p>

<p>"How long did he stay?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes only. The others who called were..."</p>

<p>"Never mind if they didn't see him...Now as to last night; as
I understand it, Mr and Mrs. Townley left together; shortly
afterwards Miss Garrett left; then Miss Cynthia."</p>

<p>"That's right, sir."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"The hired servants had already gone, sir. I just looked
around to see that everything was all right, and I went home,
too. Ten to eleven it was when I left."</p>

<p>"How long was that after Miss Cynthia had gone?"</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes to half an hour, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you see Mr. Dordress before you left?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Went into the studio to ask if there was anything
he wanted."</p>

<p>"What was he doing?"</p>

<p>"Sitting in his big chair, sir, reading."</p>

<p>"Did he appear to be composed?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, sir. Spoke to me quiet and friendly. Said there was
nothing he wanted."</p>

<p>"Did you notice what he was reading?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. A little book with a green cover."</p>

<p>"He must have put it back on the shelf. It's not anywhere
around now."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"So you were the last person to see him alive," said Lee
quietly.</p>

<p>Hillman's face broke up. He was squeezing his hands together
to control their trembling. "Don't say that, sir!" he stammered.
"O, don't say that!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Lee, affecting to be surprised.</p>

<p>"That's what they always say of a person when he is suspected
of...of...Mr. Dordress was a good master. I have worked for him
nine years...how could I...?"</p>

<p>"You are not suspected of anything," said Lee mildly. "Have
you any reason to believe that Mr. Dordress did not kill
himself?"</p>

<p>"No...yes...how should I know?" stammered Hillman. "There was
bad talk here last night. You know about it."</p>

<p>"I know about it," said Lee dryly. "But everything points to
suicide. I suspect nobody. I am investigating merely to clear up
any possible doubt. Keep your mouth shut, Hillman. We must be
careful not to start anything that might sully Mr. Dordress'
name."</p>

<p>"O, yes, sir! Did you know, sir, that Miss Garrett was
overheard to threaten Mr. Dordress' life?"</p>

<p>"Who overheard her?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"One of the waiters from Millerand's, sir. It was when she
first came. Miss Garrett was the first to arrive."</p>

<p>"I hope the man will keep his mouth shut," said Lee.</p>

<p>"He said he would, sir."</p>

<p>Lee studied the butler. "Look at me, Hillman." The servant
tried hard to keep his eyes fixed on Lee's, but they would not
obey him. "What are you afraid of?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Hillman began to tremble. "I...I'm not afraid, sir. Only
distressed. My master...to go like this..."</p>

<p>Lee cut him short. "Did you know you were down in his will for
five thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>Hillman made his face look glad and surprised, but it was not
convincing. "O, Mr. Mappin! No, sir. I didn't know! Five thousand
dollars! I can scarcely believe it!"</p>

<p>"It's true," said Lee, watching him.</p>

<p>"When will I get the money, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you exactly. In a week or two, I suppose. Have
you a special need of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'm buying a little restaurant, sir."</p>

<p>"If Mr. Dordress had not died where would you have got the
money?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I would have gone to the loan sharks, sir."</p>

<p>Taking a new line, Lee asked: "What about the boy who was on
the elevator last night?"</p>

<p>Hillman was relieved. "Joe Dietz, sir."</p>

<p>"Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not to say a friend. I never took to the boy."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He's too nosey. Always making up some excuse to get into the
apartment. He pesters the guests for autographs and sells
them."</p>

<p>"Get him here if you can without arousing his suspicions. I
don't want to start anybody thinking there is a mystery about Mr.
Dordress' death."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Joe Dietz was hanging around in the lobby below and Hillman
was able to produce him in a few minutes. An under-sized young
fellow with a mean expression; sharp eyes darting in every
direction. "Where is he?" he asked.</p>

<p>Lee ignored the question. Hillman had his ears stretched, and
Lee sent him into the studio to tidy it up. To Joe he said: "Miss
Dordress was the last of the guests to leave last night, and
after that Hillman went home?"</p>

<p>"That's right, sir. Do you suspect that the boss was
murdered?" he asked, licking his lips.</p>

<p>"No," said Lee. "Mr. Dordress killed himself. I am merely
trying to establish a motive. Keep your mouth shut and I'll see
that you are taken care of."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You can depend upon me, sir," said Joe
fawningly.</p>

<p>"After Miss Dordress went home, how long was it before Hillman
left?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you exactly, sir."</p>

<p>"Well was it a long time or a short time?"</p>

<p>"Shortish."</p>

<p>"An hour?"</p>

<p>"Not so long."</p>

<p>"Half an hour?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. I didn't take no particular notice."</p>

<p>Lee was unable to pin him down. He couldn't tell whether the
boy was trying to throw suspicion on Hillman, or was withholding
the vital answer to increase his own importance. Lee let it go
for the moment. "After Hillman had gone home did you take anybody
else up to Mr. Dordress' apartment?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"What were you doing at the time?"</p>

<p>"I took a sleep, sir."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On the bench in the elevator. I left the door open."</p>

<p>"Where are the stairs in this building?"</p>

<p>"They run up in a fireproof shaft alongside the elevator."</p>

<p>"Is there a door to the stairs in the foyer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Right beside the elevator."</p>

<p>"While you were sleeping couldn't somebody have come up the
stairs?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. The door's locked. It's a spring lock. If there was
a fire and the tenants run down the stairs they could open the
door from the inside. But on the outside you have to have a
key."</p>

<p>"How did Hillman look when he came to work this morning?
Distressed? Excited?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. He looked the same as usual."</p>

<p>"Joe," said Lee very casually, "did you come up here to Mr.
Dordress' flat last night after Hillman had gone?"</p>

<p>Joe became very excited. "No, sir! No, sir I What for would I
come up here so late? I swear I never saw Mr. Dordress last
night. May God strike me dead if I ain't telling the truth!"</p>

<p>"Leave God out of it," said Lee dryly. He felt that the boy
was lying somewhere.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, can I see him?" asked Joe with unpleasant
eagerness. "No," said Lee.</p>

<p>After the boy had gone Lee called up Stan Oberry. Stan
operated a small, high-class detective agency, and Lee was
accustomed to calling on him for assistance. "Stan," he said,
"there are two men that I want tailed. The first is Joe Dietz, an
elevator boy at &mdash; Madison Avenue. He's hanging around the
lobby of the house off duty, if you can send a man over. Joe is
the rat-faced one. The other man is George Hillman, Mr. Dordress'
servant. He'll be busy in the house all day. While waiting for
him, your man might go up to 729 Calhoun Street, the Bronx, where
he lives, and pick up all he can about Hillman's family, his
recent movements, and his habits generally."</p>

<p>"Okay, Lee."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">THE bell rang. When Hillman opened the door, the
tall figure of Siebert Ackroyd entered quickly. Siebert was
terribly upset. "Is Miss Dordress here?" he demanded of
Hillman.</p>

<p>"I'll see, Sir."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, tell me plainly, is she here or isn't
she?"</p>

<p>"I don't know if she can see anybody, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, go tell her I'm here."</p>

<p>Lee Mappin, hearing the voices, came out of the studio. He
greeted Siebert coolly, and Siebert, observing it, stiffened. Lee
said to Hillman: "Wait a moment."</p>

<p>"Are you giving the orders here?" said Siebert angrily.</p>

<p>"So it would appear," said Lee.</p>

<p>"By whose authority?"</p>

<p>"Cynthia's."</p>

<p>"And are you going to prevent me from seeing her?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I merely wanted to have a few words with you
first. Come in here." He led Siebert into the gunroom out of the
hearing of Hillman.</p>

<p>Siebert made an effort to overcome his angry manner. "Mr.
Mappin, this is a terrible blow to me," he said. "Please overlook
it if I...if I..."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Lee equably. "...It is more terrible even than it
appears, Siebert...I have reason to believe that Gavin did not
kill himself."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Siebert. "You mean you think "&mdash;his voice
sunk&mdash;"murdered?"</p>

<p>"It is possible," said Lee. "I know I can rely on you to say
nothing."</p>

<p>"But how?...how?" stammered Siebert.</p>

<p>"I don't know. What did you do when you left here last
night?"</p>

<p>Siebert's face flamed with anger. "By God!' are you suggesting
that I...!"</p>

<p>Lee betrayed impatience. "That's a foolish answer, Siebert. I
am 'suggesting' nothing. I don't know what happened. I haven't
any theory as yet. It's my duty to follow up every line wherever
it may lead. Where did you go last night?"</p>

<p>"I don't have to answer you," muttered Siebert.</p>

<p>"Of course not. But a refusal to answer leads to a certain
inference..."</p>

<p>A blank look come into Siebert's face. "I can tell you where I
went," he said slowly. "But I have no corroboration of it."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me anyhow."</p>

<p>"I walked the streets," said Siebert bleakly. "I was all
upset. I had quarrelled with Cynthia."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Lee.</p>

<p>This made Siebert freshly angry. "So she tells you all about
me, eh?"</p>

<p>"What streets?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you. I went over on the East side because I
didn't want to meet anybody. I went into different bars and
drank. I couldn't point them out to you."</p>

<p>"What time did you get home?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It was after two. They could tell you at the
Allingham, where I live."</p>

<p>Lee nodded. "I'll tell Cynthia you're here," he said.</p>

<p>He found the two girls in the guest-room. Cynthia, with a
quiet white face, was dictating the necessary family letters to
Fanny. Lee said: "Siebert is here."</p>

<p>Cynthia sprang up. A little colour came into her face. "You
want to see him, then?"</p>

<p>"Siebert? Why of course!"</p>

<p>Lee took her hand. "My dear!" he said gravely.</p>

<p>"What is it, Lee?" she asked, anxiously searching his
face.</p>

<p>"Keep a firm grip on yourself!"</p>

<p>Cynthia was very quick of apprehension. Every vestige of
colour drained out of her face. "Lee...you don't suspect that
Siebert could have...?"</p>

<p>"I don't suspect him." he said. "I have no evidence. But he
could have done it."</p>

<p>"O, no! no!" she whispered. "Not Siebert! I couldn't bear it.
Lee!"</p>

<p>"My dear," he said. "I believe you are brave enough to face
anything."</p>

<p>Cynthia went quickly to the sunroom. Lee waited for her in the
foyer. When Siebert saw Cynthia coming, his angry, virile face
turned imploring and his hands went out to her. "Cynthia!"</p>

<p>She stopped short of him. He took a step towards her, but she
fended him off. "Has Mappin put that ugly suspicion into your
mind?" he demanded. "Have you turned against me?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't think there's anything in
it."</p>

<p>"If I could only tell you how I felt when I heard what had
happened!" he said brokenly. "I mean, because I was angry at
Gavin last night and spoke against him. God help me! I felt as if
it was my fault somehow. My rage was only a flash in the pan,
Cyn. I was sore because you kept me at arm's length. I had
nothing against Gavin, really. Nobody knows better than me what a
fine man he was!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Siebert," she whispered.</p>

<p>His arms went out again. "Cynthia!"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I can't! I am all empty inside...I have
no feeling for anything or anybody now...except him...Thank you
for coming, Siebert."</p>

<p>He turned from her and strode out of the apartment without
looking at Lee. "He acted badly," Cynthia murmured to Lee; "he
got angry. But that doesn't mean anything. Whenever Siebert is
distressed or upset he flies in a temper and lashes out at
whoever may be around him. It's just a boyish trick."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Lee, it couldn't have been Siebert!" she murmured, searching
his eyes for confirmation.</p>

<p>He pressed her hand. "Don't you believe me?"</p>

<p>"I neither believe nor disbelieve. I hope you're right. I'm
waiting for evidence."</p>

<p>"Then find it!" she cried. "Find it quickly! I must know the
truth or I'll go out of my mind!"</p>

<p>"Do you know Alan Talbert?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I've met him; a handsome young man, a playwright, a great
admirer of Dad's. Dad spoke of him as rather a silly fellow, but
likeable."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That's all I know."</p>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">CHAPTER IX.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">AFTER Cynthia had been given an opportunity to
be with her father, Gavin's body was removed to a funeral
establishment. Lee received the reporters again, and answered
their questions as far as he thought proper. Lee was an old hand
in dealing with the press, and notwithstanding the reporters'
cleverness, they were unable to extract an admission from him
that there was anything unexplained about the death of Gavin
Dordress. By this time the news was all over town, and a long
procession of callers began; Gavin's admirers, actors who had
appeared in his plays, playwrights he had encouraged. None of the
other guests at dinner the night before called or phoned, and Lee
set out in search of them.</p>

<p>First to the Townley Theatre where Mack maintained a luxurious
suite of offices. The outer room, where a line of playwrights and
actors was usually waiting, was empty now. Lee was told that Mr.
Townley had telephoned he would not come to the office. Lee could
not go behind that, though the frightened faces of elevator boy,
receptionist and secretary suggested that Mack was in fact in the
building, probably in one of the unbridled rages for which he was
known. Lee left a note for him, and proceeded to the Townley
apartment on Park Avenue. Here a wooden-faced man-servant told
him that Mr. Townley had gone to his office. "There's a lack of
team-work," said Lee dryly. "Is Mrs. Townley in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where she may be found?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"When will she return?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say, sir."</p>

<p>While Lee was talking to the man a trunk was carried across
the foyer and out through a service door. "Has Mrs. Townley left
the city?" he asked at a venture.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir," admitted the servant.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so at once? Where has she gone?"</p>

<p>"I have not been informed, sir."</p>

<p>Lee could get no more out of him. Nor were the hallmen any
more communicative. From a booth in a drugstore he called Stan
Oberry again. "Stan, I have been informed that Bea Ellerman, that
is, Mrs. Mack Townley, has left town. Find out for me where she's
gone. In the case of so prominent a person it ought not to be
difficult. If you have a discreet man on call, let him try to
find out what led to this sudden departure. A woman might get it
better."</p>

<p>"Okay, Lee."</p>

<p>Then to the Hotel Conradi-Windermere where Gail Garrett leased
an apartment. Lee did not send up his name but proceeded directly
to Gail's quarters in the tower. The door was opened by Gail's
own maid, Catherine, who was known to Lee. The elderly woman was
pale and shaken. Lee made believe not to notice anything out of
the way. "Good morning, Catherine. I'd like to see Miss Garrett
for a moment."</p>

<p>"She's not in," muttered Catherine.</p>

<p>Lee could hear Gail's voice behind the closed door of the
living-room. He pushed past Catherine. After all, he had known
Gail Garrett for fifteen years.</p>

<p>"It won't do you no good!" complained Catherine. "She won't
see you. She won't see nobody!"</p>

<p>"She is seeing somebody now," said Lee.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Bittner from the theatre."</p>

<p>Lee seated himself in the foyer. "I will wait until she is
free."</p>

<p>Catherine, wringing her hands together, went away through a
service door.</p>

<p>Lee heard the rumble of a man's voice behind the living-room
door. The words were indistinguishable. Then Gail's voice, shrill
and strident: "I don't care! I won't appear. I won't! I won't! I
won't, do you hear? All right, put a notice in the paper; return
the money. Don't you think I have any feelings?"</p>

<p>Another rumble. "Get out!" screamed Gail with a startling
addition of profanity. "You're driving me mad! Get out! Get out,
you fool! Close the show. I will never act again! Never! Never!
I'm through!"</p>

<p>Little Solon Bittner, Gail Garrett's producer, came out of the
living-room very red in the face. The door slammed behind him.
The two men nodded to each other; Bittner said to Lee with a
desperate air: "She refuses to go on to-night. She wants me to
close the show. You are her friend. Try to get her to listen to
reason."</p>

<p>"Give her a little time, Bittner," said Lee. "She's had a
terrible shock."</p>

<p>"But if Miss Garrett is unable to go on because Gavin Dordress
shoots himself, it will make a scandal. It will injure her."</p>

<p>Lee shrugged.</p>

<p>The little man went on out waving his hands.</p>

<p>Lee knocked on the living-room door. "Gail, it's me. Lee
Mappin."</p>

<p>"Go away!" answered a strangled voice.</p>

<p>"Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's imperative."</p>

<p>"Go away!"</p>

<p>Lee opened the door and walked in. The great beautiful room
decorated in the style of Louis Seize by a master, was all in
disorder. One of the gilt chairs was overthrown; clothes,
pillows, torn papers were scattered about. Gail, wearing an
elaborate negligee, sat crouched in a chair bent almost double as
if in physical pain. In her hands she had a handkerchief that she
was slowly tearing into shreds. Her face was ravaged-by grief,
rage, fear; it was impossible to tell which; perhaps all three.
She looked terrible and she didn't care. "Get out!" she said
sullenly, with scarcely a glance at Lee. "I told you not to come
in. Have I no privacy in my own home? Can't I ever be left
alone?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Lee, "but you must listen to me for a few
moments." He sat down.</p>

<p>She sprang up in a rage. "Must? Must? I'm not accustomed to
that sort of talk and I'm not going to take it from you! Leave my
rooms or I'll telephone to the office and have you put out!"</p>

<p>Lee faced her out. "You're only making a show of yourself," he
said calmly. "If you will stop to think, you must realise that I
have always been your friend, that I was Gavin's friend..."</p>

<p>She heard only one word of this. Clapping her hands to her
head she began to pace the long room with uneven steps. She had
neglected to fasten the negligee around her, and it streamed open
revealing her nightdress. "Gavin! Gavin! Gavin!" she wailed.
"He's gone! Nothing can bring him back to me. I shall never touch
his hand again, nor hear the sound of his dear voice! I cannot
bear it! I will not bear it!"</p>

<p>Lee waited with a slightly cynical air for her to exhaust
herself. She turned on him suddenly. "You sit there as calmly as
if you had come to tea!" she cried. "You feel nothing! You are
inhuman!"</p>

<p>"What I feel or do not feel has nothing to do with it," said
Lee. "I have work to do. There is reason to believe that Gavin
did not kill himself."</p>

<p>He noted that she was not surprised. She resumed her pacing.
"What difference does it make?" she mourned. "He is gone and
nothing can bring him, back to me."</p>

<p>"Last night you were overheard to threaten his life," said
Lee.</p>

<p>That arrested her attention. She stopped, staring at him
wildly, pressing her face between her hands. "Overheard? By
whom?"</p>

<p>"One of the waiters hired for the evening."</p>

<p>Gail sneered. "It's a lie! He can't prove it!"</p>

<p>"He can testify to it."</p>

<p>"Nobody would believe a waiter!"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately there were other unpleasant incidents. The
scene when you left."</p>

<p>"Who would dare to accuse me?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Lee dryly, "nobody is safe from an
accusation."</p>

<p>She was intimidated by the quiet voice. She said, taking a
lower tone: "Would you accuse me of such a thing, Lee?"</p>

<p>He met her eyes squarely. "Certainly, if I had evidence that
it was true."</p>

<p>She became more conciliatory. "But Lee, everybody knows what
an angry woman is. She makes terrible threats without meaning a
word of it. You know I loved Gavin. I am shattered by his loss!"
Lee said nothing. "What did you come here for?" she asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"To get you to tell me the truth as far as you know it...What
did you do when you left Gavin's last night?"</p>

<p>"I came home."</p>

<p>"Right away?"</p>

<p>"Just as quick as a taxi could bring me."</p>

<p>"Did you enter the hotel through the lobby?"</p>

<p>"I never use the lobby. I came in the private entrance for the
tower apartments."</p>

<p>"There are two elevators," said Lee. "Which one did you use?
Right or left as you face them?"</p>

<p>Gail's lip curled. "I suppose you are going to verify my
statements by questioning the elevator boys."</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"All right. I came up in the left-hand elevator. And it was
operated by the one they call Vincent, one of the older
employees. I hope you're satisfied."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Lee. "Did you go out again later?"</p>

<p>Gail bit her lip, hesitated, blurted out: "No!" Immediately
she added: "I suppose you'll question the boys about that,
too."</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"All right," she said defiantly. "I'll save you the trouble. I
did go out again."</p>

<p>"Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"I won't tell you."</p>

<p>"That looks bad, Gail."</p>

<p>"I don't care how it looks. I was on my own private
business."</p>

<p>"For your own sake I ask you to tell me," Lee said. "After all
these years you must know that you can trust me."</p>

<p>"You'll get no more out of me," she said with, tight lips.</p>

<p>Lee got up. "Then I'll have to find out through other
sources."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck."</p>

<p>"I met Bittner outside," said Lee. "The poor fellow was in
despair. Of course, he stands to lose a fortune if you insist on
his closing the show."</p>

<p>"Closing the show?" said Gail sharply. "Whoever suggested such
a thing?"</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"O, for God's sake!" she cried melodramatically, "why must you
all take me so literally! I'm not going to close the show. I'm a
good trouper. I shall go on as usual to-night though my heart is
breaking!"</p>

<p>"Then you'd better telephone him," Lee suggested dryly.</p>

<p>Through one of the managers of the hotel who was an
acquaintance. Lee got in touch with Vincent, the elevator boy.
Vincent told him that he had taken up Miss Garrett about ten-thirty
the previous night, and almost immediately afterwards had
carried her down again. She had taken a taxi at the private door.
It was a driver who regularly served the hotel, and Vincent was
able to give Lee his name. Later in the afternoon the taxi-driver
came to Lee's office and told the following story: "Miss Gail
Garrett hired me at the private door of the Conradi-Windermere
about twenty to eleven. I recognised her from pictures. She
looked bad. I thought she had been drinking. She told me to take
her to &mdash; Bayard Street on the East Side. That's a bad
neighbourhood. Near Chinatown. The Nonpariel Social Club occupies
two floors at that number. She sent me in to ask for a guy called
"Cagey." He was there, playing pool, and I brought him out to
her..."</p>

<p>"What sort of fellow?" interrupted Lee.</p>

<p>"He was well-named," said the taxi-driver. "Gangster, if I
know anything. A slick, smooth young guy with a wall eye. Swell
dresser. Eyetalian descent. A two-gun man by the look of
him."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Lee.</p>

<p>"He leans in the back of the cab and talks to her. I can't
hear much but I makes out he's bawling her out for coming to him
and leaving a wide-open trail. Seemed funny a young East Side guy
would have the face to talk to Gail Garrett like that. I figures
he must have something on her. Well, she gets out and pays me,
and I drive away leaving them there, that's all."</p>

<p>"Damn!" muttered Lee. "Didn't you realise that you were on the
track of something? Didn't you watch them?"</p>

<p>The driver compressed his lips. "Sure, I thought it was funny,
but it was none of my business. Us hackies can't afford to get
nosey. Mister. The nosey ones just don't last." Lee gave him a
tip and promised that there would be more in it for him later if
he kept his mouth shut.</p>

<p>Lee phoned to Stan Oberry for a report on the youth known as
"Cagey" who was a member of the Nonpariel Social Club in Bayard
Street. Within a couple of hours he was in possession of the
following:</p> <br>

<p class="quote">"Francesco Chigi (American pronunciation
'Cagey') known also as Frank Chigi, Cecco Chigi and Cagey Frank.
23 years old; born at &mdash; Mulberry Street where his parents
still live, but they have not seen him since he came out of
prison. Spent most of his boyhood in various Reform Schools and
Houses of Correction. Has served two years in Sing Sing for
robbery and assault. Is now credited with being one of Manny
Peglar's 'torpedoes,' i.e., killers. Was arrested and tried last
year for the murder of Goose McAuley, member of a rival gang.
Acquitted for lack of evidence. A dangerous man. Is said to
derive a good income from victimising wealthy women. Several such
are known to have fallen for his good looks. The police say that
it is useless trying to prosecute such cases. I have verified
your information that he was called out of the Nonpariel Social
Club at ten-fifty last night by a richly-dressed woman. They
drove away in a taxi. He has not been seen around his usual
haunts to-day. I have no information as to his present home.
Additional report will follow."</p>

<p><br> When Lee returned to the Dordress apartment the nervous
Hillman said that Mr. Mack Townley had not called on the phone.
Mr. Emmett Gundy was waiting in the sunroom. Lee went in to
Emmett. No matter how poor Emmett was he contrived to be well
dressed. He would have gone without food sooner than show himself
otherwise. He was wearing the blue fur overcoat which Lee thought
silly. Lee had known him for twenty-five years, but had not seen
much of him lately. Out of doors with his hat on, Emmett could
still pass for a handsome young man. But of late his face had
taken on the sour look of one who feels that he is not
appreciated. He said the things that Lee had already listened to
twenty times that day. "What a terrible thing, Lee! Little did I
think last night that I would never see Gavin again! I can
scarcely realise that he's gone. Every moment I expect to see him
come walking out of the studio. I didn't hear of it until I went
out at noon. Why didn't you send for me? Is there anything I can
do?"</p>

<p>Emmett had always been like that; self-centred. He couldn't
get excited about anything except what concerned himself. Lee sat
down, suddenly conscious of an immense weariness. He had had no
time to indulge his own grief. "There is nothing to do," he said.
"It has all been taken care of...But I'd like to ask you a
question or two."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Emmett, "anything at all."</p>

<p>"You are one of Gavin's closest friends; first, I must tell
you there is a suspicion that he may not have killed
himself."</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised," said Emmett. "There were ugly passions
brewing here last night...What evidence have you?"</p>

<p>"Practically none. It is chiefly Cynthia. She refuses to
believe that her father killed himself."</p>

<p>"That's natural enough," said Emmett. "Maybe when she gets
over the shock she'll forget her suspicions."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"What did you want of me?"</p>

<p>"You and Louella Kip were the first ones to leave here after
dinner last night. Where did you go?"</p>

<p>Emmett smiled thinly. "You don't think that I...?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" said Lee wearily. "Gavin has been practically
keeping me for the last three months. It's not likely that
I..."</p>

<p>"Of course not. But answer the question."</p>

<p>"I told Gavin we were going on to another party," said Emmett.
"That was just an excuse to get away. As a matter of fact,
Louella and I went directly to my place. I had been discussing
with her some changes I was going to make in my novel, and we got
out the script and went to work on it. We got so interested in it
we worked for three or four hours. It was two o'clock before she
went home."</p>

<p>"Where is your place?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"It's a dump on East Thirty-fourth Street," said Emmett.
"Number &mdash;. Just one room. I've been so broke lately I
couldn't afford anything better."</p>

<p>"Walk-up?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Did anybody see you come in, or see Louella leave?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it."</p>

<p>"Where does Louella live?"</p>

<p>"In a-boarding-house on Irving Place. Mrs, Cayley's."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Lee.</p>

<p>He got up to indicate that he was finished, but Emmett
lingered. "Have you any theory as to what happened?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"None whatever," said Lee. "I'm just working to satisfy
Cynthia."</p>

<p>Still Emmett made no move to go. Finally he said: "I'm in a
hell of a hole, Lee. These circulating libraries are ruining us
novelists. More people are reading my novels than ever before,
but my royalties are only a third of what they were. Gavin had
promised to lend me a hundred to tide me over until I could
collect my next advance. I was to see him at five to-day. I don't
know what I'll do now."</p>

<p>Lee thought: Always the same Emmett. He makes a touch with the
air of one conferring a favour. He drew out his cheque book. "Let
me take his place," he said.</p>

<p>"That certainly is good of you. Lee. I'll pay it back just as
soon as I place my novel."</p>

<p>When he had gone. Lee looked up Mrs. Cayley's number in the
phone book. In due course he heard Louella's gentle voice on the
wire, and his face softened; he liked Louella; everybody liked
her. Her voice now was shaken with distress. "O, Mr. Mappin, I
can't tell you how dreadfully I feel about Mr. Dordress! To have
this happen so soon after we had seen him! I didn't know him very
well, but he was always so kind, so warm-hearted, so generous, I
felt as if he was one of my dearest friends!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt of the genuineness of Louella's feelings.
Lee said, as if it were a matter of small concern: "There are
various points in connection with last night that I have to check
up. You understand that it's purely a formality. Where did you
and Emmett go when you left Gavin's?"</p>

<p>"We went direct to Emmett's place," she said quickly. "He
wanted to read me part of his new novel and ask my advice about
changing it. We got interested in it we worked over it for three
hours more. It was nearly two when I got home."</p>

<p>"Do you room alone?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said in a surprised voice. "Why do you ask
that?"</p>

<p>"Did anybody in the boarding-house see you come in?"</p>

<p>"O, no! At that hour it's like a house of the dead." An
agitated note came into her voice. "Why do you ask me these
questions, Mr. Mappin. Is there anything wrong? Is there..."</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" said Lee soothingly. "It's just a
formality."</p>

<p>She did not sound altogether reassured. However, he bade her
good-bye and hung up.</p>

<p>Lee, looking for Mack Townley, called up his office, his home,
the Racquet Club, where he was accustomed to play handball in the
afternoon; the Federal League Club. He was said to be not at any
of these places, nor would any one tell Lee where he might be
found. There could be no doubt that Mack was deliberately keeping
out of the way.</p>

<p>Before he was married, Mack had hung out for years at the
Federal League Club, and Lee had a hunch that he would fly back
there like a homing pigeon. He decided to take a chance on it.
Putting on hat and coat again, he had himself driven to the
magnificent quarters of the Federal League on Park Avenue.</p>

<p>To the boy at the desk he said off-handedly: "Mr. Townley
phoned me to come here for a conference. I'll go right up to his
room."</p>

<p>Lee had the kind of front that impresses club servants, and
the boy never thought of questioning his statement. As he started
up in the elevator, Lee said suddenly. "There! I've forgotten the
number they gave me at the desk!"</p>

<p>"Whose room, sir?" asked the elevator man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Townley's."</p>

<p>"Number seventeen, sir."</p>

<p>Lee knocked on the door of seventeen and Mack's sullen voice
answered: "Who is it?"</p>

<p>Lee smiled to himself at the success of his ruse. "Lee
Mappin," he said, and went in without waiting to be bidden.</p>

<p>Mack Townley's heavy face was a study when he saw Lee. He was
trying to make out that he was glad to see him, but he could not
control the flush of anger. He sat relaxed and glooming in an
easy chair by the window. There was a whisky bottle on a stand
within reach of his hand. "Hello!" he growled. "I've been trying
to get hold of you all day."</p>

<p>Lee's bland expression suggested: Not too hard. I think! He
said: "I've been trying to get hold of you, too."</p>

<p>Lee was shocked by the change that only eighteen hours had
worked in Mack. His face was ravaged as if by disease. The glass
when he lifted it to his lips trembled violently in his hand.
"Have a drink," he growled. "You'll find another glass in the
bathroom."</p>

<p>"No thanks," said Lee. "You know me. I can't drink hard liquor
before dinner."</p>

<p>"God, Lee, this is a frightful blow to me! I can't face
it!"</p>

<p>This sounded like something Lee had heard a short time before.
These mourners for Gavin's death thought first of themselves, it
seemed. "I got in a rage with Gavin last night," Mack went on. "I
cursed him when I left him. And then to hear that he was
dead&mdash;God! It was as if I had killed him by wishing him
dead!" Mack, clenching his fist until the knuckles whitened,
pounded his knee. "God, Lee, I've been in hell all day! I've been
in hell!"</p>

<p>Lee regarded him speculatively. It was clear that the man was
in hell, but he wondered if Mack had given the true reason for
it.</p>

<p>Mack squirmed under Lee's quiet gaze. "What did you want of
me?" he growled. "It seems we have been playing at cross purposes
all day."</p>

<p>Lee's look said: The cross purposes were not mine! "I suppose
everything has come on you," muttered Mack.</p>

<p>"Do you want help? Is there plenty of money available?"</p>

<p>"O, plenty of money," said Lee.</p>

<p>"What is it, then?"</p>

<p>"Mack," said Lee, "there is a suspicion that Gavin did not
kill himself."</p>

<p>Mack's face flushed in a terrible manner that made it look
blackish. "Is there any evidence that he was put out of the way,"
he demanded harshly, "or do you inspect me just because I cursed
him last night?"</p>

<p>Lee faced him out. "Not much evidence," he said. "Did you read
the letter he left?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was in the paper."</p>

<p>"It does not ring true," said Lee. "It is too general in its
terms."</p>

<p>"Who's to say it doesn't ring true? Gavin was a queer fellow
at heart."</p>

<p>"Certainly. Like all of us. But not queer in just that
way."</p>

<p>"It it in his writing?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see how you can go behind it."</p>

<p>"Mack," said Lee quietly, "what did you do when you left
Gavin's apartment last night?"</p>

<p>Mack's face turned black again. He half hoisted himself out of
his chair, then dropped back into it heavily. "I suppose you've
got the right to suspect me," he growled. "...After the way I
talked. God knows I had the will to kill Gavin last night...but I
didn't do it."</p>

<p>"Where did you go?" persisted Lee.</p>

<p>"Bea and I drove home to our apartment," Mack answered with a
defiant glare. "We went directly to bed. I read for a while and
then I slept. And that's that."</p>

<p>"What did you read?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>The seeming-simple question put Mack in a violent rage. "What
the hell is it to you what I read?" he shouted.</p>

<p>Lee shrugged.</p>

<p>Mack glanced at him almost with fear, and moderated his tone.
"I don't remember what I read. Some newspaper or magazine I
picked up...I admit I was upset. But gradually I quieted
down."</p>

<p>"Where's Bea?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Mack scowled at him. "Have you been looking for her?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>Mack hesitated before he answered, drawing his hand down over
his face. It was apparent that he was almost at the limit of his
endurance. When he spoke he did not answer Lee directly. "People
like us have no privacy at all," he growled. "We live surrounded
by a mob. Our so-called friends force their way into our very
bedrooms before we're up. We're spied upon every moment by
servants, reporters and God knows who all. When Bea heard this
morning what had happened she was in a state of collapse. I have
put her in a sanatorium to save her from prying eyes."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I won't tell you that. Not even you. I promised her."</p>

<p>"You realise, of course, that Bea is the only one who can
support the alibi you have offered."</p>

<p>"All right," growled Mack, "if you want to bring a charge
against me, Bea will appear."</p>

<p>"I don't want to bring a charge against you," said Lee. "I
want you to give me the facts that will clear you once and for
all."</p>

<p>"I'll satisfy you to-morrow," muttered Mack. "Just give me
time to get my grip."</p>

<p>Lee glanced at the whisky bottle but said nothing. "I'm not
the only one that had it in for Gavin," growled Mack.</p>

<p>"I'm following up every line," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Here's something you don't know," said Mack. "A week ago Gail
Garrett came to me to borrow a thousand dollars. I said: 'Good
God, Gail! Bittner is paying you fifteen hundred a week, and
twenty-five per cent of the net. The show is making money. Where
has it all gone?' She said: 'It's my debts, Mack; they're keeping
me poor.'"</p>

<p>"How do you figure that this connects Gail with what happened
last night?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Mack said meaningly: "In this town there are guns for hire,
Lee. They come high. Suppose Gail was getting the money together
to hire a gun?"</p>

<p>"Did you let her have the thousand?"</p>

<p>"No. I have other uses for my money."</p>

<p>"I'll look into it," said Lee. "What day did she come to
you?"</p>

<p>"Last Monday," said Mack, "the seventh."</p>

<p>Upon leaving Mack, Lee went to his office in Madison Avenue
nearby, to see if anything had come in. He found three reports
waiting for him. The first:</p> <br>

<p class="typewriter">I picked up Joe Dietz at &mdash; Madison
Avenue and kept him under observation until he started away at 2
pm. He took the subway to the Bushwick section of Brooklyn where
he lives. He entered a large poolroom at &mdash; Marcy Avenue and
played pool. He was well known there. The place was pretty full
and I was able to mix among the watchers without attracting
attention to myself. The talk was all about the suicide of Gavin
Dordress. Everybody was asking Joe Dietz questions because they
knew he worked in the house. Joe was quite the hero of the hour.
He claimed to be a personal friend of Mr. Dordress' but it
sounded phony to me. He was acting mysterious, sort of letting on
that it was no suicide if the truth was known, and he, Joe, knew
enough to bust the case wide open if he wanted to speak. My
opinion is, he was just running his lip, as they say. He has the
look of a loosemouth. He left the place at four and I tailed him
to his home at &mdash; Bedford. He lives with his parents at that
address. I dropped him there and returned to the poolroom to see
what I could pick up It wasn't much. Joe is known simply as a
young waster who spends all his spare time playing pool with
others of his kind, and occasionally goes on the loose in the
navy-yard section. The only thing funny about him is, that he
certainly has more money to spend than the 18 or 20 a week he
pulls down as an elevator man.</p>

<p class="typewriter">J.B.</p>

<p><br> The second report:</p> <br>

<p class="typewriter">According to instructions I proceeded to
729 Calhoun Street, the Bronx. It is a five-story walk-up
apartment house for thirty families. Pretty cheap rents. There is
no family by the name of Hillman living there now. The janitor
told me they moved away about six weeks ago. He didn't know their
present address. I got some of their old neighbours in talk.
Hillman family consisted of father, mother and a boy and girl of
high school age. The father, a quiet man, worked long hours and
was rarely seen. His wife gave out that he was in the theatrical
business. Mrs. Hillman was not popular with the neighbours, being
considered too ritzy. Was always boasting about her rich friends.
At the time they moved she told her neighbours that they were in
the money now, and would be living in a much better style
hereafter. She did not tell anybody where they were going. On
inquiring at the Post Office I found they had left no forwarding
address. When Hillman leaves his work to-night I will tail him to
his new home.</p>

<p class="typewriter">R.S.</p>

<p><br> The third report:</p>

<p class="typewriter">I ran down the driver of the taxi who
carried Mr and Mrs. Mack Townley from &mdash; Madison Avenue to
the Andorra Apartments last night shortly before ten-thirty. His
name is Dave Levine, of &mdash; Scammell Street. Levine told me
that the couple quarrelled so loudly on the way home that he
could hear part of what they said. He was jealous; accused his
wife of being too friendly with Gavin Dordress. She threatened to
leave him. At the Andorra Mrs. Townley went straight in, but
Townley, when he had paid the driver, walked away down Park in a
blind rage. Tappan, night hallman at the Andorra, told me Townley
returned at 3 am. As Tappin put it, he looked as if he'd been
through the mill. Townley, still in a rage, left the house again
about eight-forty. Two hours later Mrs. Townley called a cab and
had herself driven to Grand Central Station. She bought a ticket
to Reno, Nevada, and engaged space right through. Her trunks were
sent after her. I got next to Cobbett, the butler at the
Townley's, but he wouldn't talk. I'll try to get a line on the
other servants.</p>

<p class="typewriter">A.A.</p>

<p><br> Lee sat for a while, smoking and studying. Finally, he
put the reports in his pocket and went on to the Dordress
apartment. His first thought there was to consult the stubs in
Gavin's current cheque book. He discovered that on November 7th
Gavin had issued a cheque to "G.G." for a thousand dollars. Lee's
face turned pretty grim.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">CHAPTER X.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">LEE MAPPIN and Cynthia met in the sunroom. Under
Cynthia's direction Hillman was watering the rare ferns and
tropical plants that had been Gavin's pride. Cynthia was moving
about pinching off a dead leaf here and there, and tying up the
plants that were too heavy for their stems. At five o'clock she
had insisted on letting Fanny go home. "Dad used to do this every
afternoon," she said, with a painful smile.</p>

<p>When Hillman had finished his job and departed, she wanted to
know what had happened. Lee hesitated. "You promised to tell me
everything...everything!" she reminded him. "It is the only way I
can have any peace of mind."</p>

<p>Lee glanced into the foyer to make sure that the long-eared
Hillman had really gone, and closed the glass doors. "Various
things have come to light," he laid; "some with an ugly look, but
nothing conclusive. At the moment it is all at loose ends. None
of them will tie together."</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said.</p>

<p>He did so.</p>

<p>Cynthia's pale face, refined by grief, turned hard. "It was
Gail Garrett," she murmured. "That's clear!"</p>

<p>"Keep an open mind!" Lee warned her, "until we turn up the
final positive proof."</p>

<p>Later, Lee said: "If you have no objections, I would like to
send to my place for a bag and sleep here for the next few
nights."</p>

<p>"Objections? Of course not! But why. Lee?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel that I have got all the evidence that these
rooms may contain, and I don't like to leave the place unguarded.
We can't trust Hillman. I could pay him off and send him home,
but how would I know that he turned in all the keys? Or Joe Dietz
may have secured a key to the apartment. If I padlocked the outer
door it would certainly start a story that some dark mystery was
concealed here."</p>

<p>"I'll stay here with you if you want me," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Very good idea," said Lee. "In your own place the reporters
would continually be ringing your phone and your door-bell. I
didn't suggest it because I thought it might be painful for
you."</p>

<p>Cynthia looked around with her poignant smile. "No," she said.
"I feel Dad's presence in these rooms, but it doesn't hurt; it
comforts me."</p>

<p>"Very well, that's settled," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I'll ask Hillman if there's any dinner," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Shall I ask Fanny to join us?" said Lee.</p>

<p>"If you'd like to have her."</p>

<p>"I have several lines out. It is possible I may be called
away. I wouldn't like you to be alone here."</p>

<p>"I'm not one of these tender females that have to be
protected. Fanny has given me her whole day already."</p>

<p>The upshot was that Lee and Cynthia dined quietly together.
Each had a burden of grief to bear, and each was comforted by the
other's presence. Neither felt obliged to talk. When the meal
came to an end Lee told Hillman he could go home as soon as he
had cleaned up. Lee and Cynthia started going over Gavin's papers
in the studio. "Hadn't I better do this first alone?" asked Lee.
"We may stumble on painful things."</p>

<p>Cynthia shook her head. "Everything that concerns Dad is dear
to me," she said. "I don't care what we may find."</p>

<p>Hillman left about eight-thirty. Half an hour later Lee was
called to the phone. It was Stan Oberry.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I have to report a slip-up," he said. "When Hillman
came out of the Madison Avenue house he dived into a taxi-cab
hound westward. He had evidently been standing inside the door
watching the traffic lights and timed his exit so that he got a
cab and across Madison without delay. Schelling, my operative,
says that Hillman couldn't have seen him. Hillman was expecting
to be tailed, and took his measures accordingly. Schelling got
another cab and followed, but lost some precious time. Hillman
dismissed his cab at Times Square and ran down one of the subway
entrances. Schelling followed, but lost him in the station. That
place, as you know, is like a rabbit warren. Schelling says he is
sure that Hillman merely ran down one flight of steps and up
another. Schelling got a place where he could watch both
platforms, and he did not see Hillman take a train."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Lee. "Operatives are only human. Let
Schelling try to tail Hillman again tomorrow. Or, if he has any
reason to believe that Hillman spotted him, put another man on
Hillman's tail."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Stan.</p>

<p>In half an hour he called Lee again. "Better luck this time,"
he said. "Frank Chigi or Cagey turned up in Hester Street a while
ago and has taken his girl out to dinner. Cagey is lousy with
money. He bought the girl a fur coat that must have set him back
three hundred dollars or more. He has taken her to Andre's, a
French restaurant in Park Row, and is buying champagne. My
operative, Vosper, is watching the place. What do you want me to
do? I've got a man here that I can send down to Vosper with
instructions. Do you want to question this Cagey?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Lee quickly. "Maybe the champagne will loosen his
tongue. The opportunity is too good to be passed up. Who is the
man you've got there in your office?"</p>

<p>"Schelling."</p>

<p>"All right. Let Schelling go down to the door and I'll pick
him up in three minutes. He can come downtown with me, and
introduce me to Vosper, and we'll work out something together.
You had better stay in your office until you hear from me."</p>

<p>"Right!"</p>

<p>Cynthia was distressed. "No, Lee, no!" she protested. "Let Mr.
Oberry do it, or one of his men. That's their work. This man
Cagey is dangerous. He is known as a killer."</p>

<p>"He won't hurt me," said Lee smiling. "I shall pose as the
most harmless little gentleman that ever took a drop too much.
Cagey is too important to turn over to anybody else."</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour later Lee and Schelling got out of a taxi
at the Park Row entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge and walked on to
Aridre's restaurant at the corner of Frankfort Street. In this
neighbourhood there are always plenty of people about. At the top
of the steps leading to the basement restaurant they ran-into
Vosper, Stan Oberry's other operative. Lee was introduced to
Vosper, and the latter said: "They're still inside."</p>

<p>"Good," said Lee. "I'm going in to try to get next to them.
You two men take cover and wait for us to come out. If I am with
the couple, follow us where-ever we may go. If they won't let me
go with them, you follow them, and communicate with me when you
can through Stan's office."</p>

<p>"Okay, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>Lee, pulling a lock of hair over his forehead, and setting his
derby and his neck-tie slightly askew, went down the steps and
entered the little restaurant with a rolling gait and an
expression of great dignity. Occasionally he hiccupped behind his
hand. He represented a type that is dear to all waiters, and the
two waiters in the place hastened forward to assist him tenderly
to a seat. Lee paused, swaying on his feet, and looked around
him. It was well past the usual dinner hour and there were only
three couples left in the place. He had no difficulty in picking
out the one he wanted. Disregarding the suggestions of the
waiters, he rolled up to the next table and sat down. A menu card
was thrust under his nose. "Don't wanna eat. Wanna drink," said
Lee, hiccupping. "Gimme Black and White highball."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>It was a comely couple at the next table. Lee's seeming-drunken
glance was all over the place, but he missed no detail.
The young man's trim, muscular figure was set off by a well-cut
brown suit. He wore a snowy shirt that emphasised his smooth,
swarthy skin and an orange tie from an expensive shop. His blue-black
hair glistened like steel under the lights. He affected an
absolutely dead pan. The girl, who was about his own age, and
like him of Italian extraction, was pretty in a cheap fashion,
and very smartly turned out. Her hat had an upstanding brim that
enframed her pert face like a halo. Over the back of her chair
was flung a costly leopard coat. Cagey addressed her as Clo-Clo.
She was crazy about her dangerous little boy friend, and could
not hide it. He accepted it as his due.</p>

<p>Lee noticed that Cagey was not drinking. Occasionally he
tasted his wine, no more. On the other hand, Clo-Clo loved it as
women love champagne. Cagey filled her glass from time to time,
and already her face was flushed and her tongue unloosed. She
leaned across the table and spoke to Cagey. Lee could read her
lips. "Take a look at the comical little guy who just come
in."</p>

<p>Cagey glanced at Lee indifferently. His eyes had the yellow
flicker of a cat animal after feeding. Lee's drink had just been
put before him. He raised it with drunken solemnity and toasted
Cagey. The young man merely stared, but the girl was
interested.</p>

<p>"Hey, daddy, drink with me!" she said. "Lee's line was the old
fashioned drunk."</p>

<p>"'S a privilege," he said, bowing to Cagey, "if the young
gen'leman will permit."</p>

<p>Cagey's glance was contemptuous. "Sure," he said.</p>

<p>Lee raised his glass. "To your pretty eyes!"</p>

<p>Clo-Clo giggled. "Ain't he the gentleman!"</p>

<p>"Gen'leman enough to reco'nise a lady when I see one!" said
Lee.</p>

<p>Clo-Clo leaned across the table to whisper to Cagey. Lee
guessed that she was saying the old guy looked like he might be
carrying a roll. Cagey shrugged. Clo-Clo said: "Come on over,
Daddy!"</p>

<p>Thus Lee found himself sitting between them and sharing the
wine. He accepted a second glass. He and Clo-Clo made the
confused noises that pass for conversation on such occasions,
while Cagey listened with a sneer. "'S a privilege to be sitting
at the table with such a smart little lady. 'S a privilege and I
'preciate it. Deeply! I'm a man enjoys society beauriful girl,
and I don't care who knows it."</p>

<p>And Clo-Clo: "You're all right. Daddy. You're a gentleman. You
certainly can hand out a fancy line."</p>

<p>"No!" said Lee, wagging his hand. "I'm a plain-spoken man. I
haven't any line to hand out. The trouble with me is, I'm too
honest. Some people resent it."</p>

<p>And so on. And so on. Unfortunately for Lee, Cagey was cold
sober. Sober and watchful. Lee said: "Wassa matter, young man?
You're not drinking wine. Won't you join me drinking health this
beauriful girl!" He toasted Clo-Clo.</p>

<p>Cagey tasted his wine and put the glass down. "Bottoms up!
Bottoms up!" cried Lee. "She's worth' it, isn't she? Don't tell
me young fellow like you can't 'preciate such beauriful
girl!"</p>

<p>Cagey was annoyed. His eyes flickered dangerously. "Ah, leave
him be," said Clo-Clo to Lee. "You and me can finish the bottle.
Frank's got a job of work to-night and he don't want to..."</p>

<p>The sleepy yellow eyes suddenly blazed, and by the girl's
suppressed cry it was evident that Cagey had stamped on her foot
under the table. Lee hiccupped. "Job of work," he muttered. "Good
boy! I honour the workers. What's your line, young man?"</p>

<p>Cagey's lips curled. "I work for a broadcasting station
trimming the cat's whiskers."</p>

<p>Lee made out to be affronted. "I may be a little high," he
said, "but I know when I'm being ribbed. If I'm intruding on this
pleasant company you only have to..."</p>

<p>"Ah, sit down, Daddy," said Clo-Clo. "Frank don't mean nothing
by it."</p>

<p>"I ask him civil question and he ribs me," said Lee,
aggrieved.</p>

<p>"I'm a printer on the Daily American," said Cagey. "I go on at
eleven o'clock. That's what Clo-Clo meant by a job of work."</p>

<p>Lee appeared to be satisfied. "Time for another bottle," he
said.</p>

<p>Cagey glanced at his watch. "I got to leave you," he said,
"you and Clo-Clo can drink it."</p>

<p>Lee rubbed his lip. "She is beauriful girl!" he murmured.</p>

<p>Clo-Clo slipped her arm through his. "Say, this dump is as gay
as a funeral parlour. You come with me, Daddy, and I'll show you
something."</p>

<p>When their waiter brought the check, Cagey coolly signified
that Lee would pay it. The three of them left the place together.
On the way out Cagey, with a hard look at Clo-Clo, whispered
something to her out of the corner of his mouth. Lee couldn't
hear it, but he got her reply: "I'll take care of him."</p>

<p>On the street Cagey bade them a casual good-bye and struck off
across Park Row in the direction of a subway entrance. This was
not the way to reach the American Building, of course. Lee had to
let him go. However, he saw Stan's men, Vosper and Schelling,
converging on the subway entrance from different directions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">CHAPTER XI.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">LEE and Clo-Clo waited at the curb for a taxi.
Lee suspected that the girl, like himself, was not as tight as
she was making out to be. As she leaned against him, he was aware
of her light fingers touching his different pockets to find out
where he kept his roll. As a matter of fact, his wallet was in
his breast pocket, and as his jacket was buttoned across, it was
not too easy to get at.</p>

<p>A cab came and Clo-Clo gave a number in Bayard Street. Lee
knew this was not where she lived. He was unable to get her to
talk about Cagey. In the cab she renewed her blandishments and
Lee caught her thin wrist just as the hand was slipping inside
the lapel of his jacket. "Naughty! Naughty!" he said with a
drunken laugh. Clo-Clo screamed with laughter.</p>

<p>They drew up before the side door of a Chinese resort that
fronted on Mott Street. Lee paid off the taxi. He had no notion
of entering this den; but he played his hand warily, since he did
not know but that Clo-Clo might still be able to warn Cagey if
Lee aroused her suspicions. It was quite in character for Lee to
turn suddenly obstinate. "Chinatown?" he muttered, as he stood
swaying on the sidewalk. "Don't like Chinatown. It's nasty. Let's
go decent place."</p>

<p>Clo-Clo slipped her arm through his. "Come on, Daddy," she
said cajolingly. "This is a real nice place. Only white people
come here. Would I bring you here if it wasn't nice?"</p>

<p>Lee stood his ground. They stood arguing it out on the
sidewalk while the Chinamen indifferently shuffled past. Lee, as
a drunken man will, suddenly changed his tune. "I'm going home.
My wife's waiting for me. She's been a good wife to me and this
ain't treating her right!" He appeared about to cry.</p>

<p>"Just one little drink. Daddy," urged Clo-Clo. "Then I'll let
you go home. A gentleman like you are wouldn't leave a girl flat
in the street."</p>

<p>"I'm going home," insisted Lee.</p>

<p>A block away a patrolman was standing under a street light
swinging his night-stick. Seeing the argument, he started
strolling towards them. Clo-Clo suddenly dropped Lee's arm, and
cursing him in a fervent whisper, went through the door of the
saloon, and slammed it after her.</p>

<p>The instant she disappeared, Lee recovered his sobriety.
Without waiting for the patrolman to come up, he hastened through
to the Bowery and from a booth in a drugstore called up Stan
Oberry's office. He gave Stan a brief account of what had
happened. Stan, it appeared, had not yet heard from Schelling and
Vosper. Lee gave Stan the number of his pay station, and stood by
waiting for him to call again.</p>

<p>In five minutes or so the call came through. Stan said: "Cagey
took a subway express to the 17710. Street station in the Bronx.
Schelling says that the train was full and Cagey didn't get on to
the fact that he was being tailed. From the subway station he
proceeded on foot to Ingoldsby Avenue. This street faces Bronx
Park. Number 33 Ingoldsby is Cagey's mark. He walked around it
taking a slant from every side, then crossed over to the Park. He
is lying on a bank below the street level watching the house.
There are lights in the upstairs windows. He is up to mischief of
some sort. Schelling left Vosper watching Cagey and went to
telephone. Schelling will stand by the telephone for five minutes
for instructions. If you want to come up there he says meet him
at the corner of Ingoldsby and 179th Street. That corner is
outside Cagey's line of vision."</p>

<p>Lee said to Stan: "Phone Schelling that if he and Vosper are
satisfied that a serious crime is contemplated, it's up to them
to prevent it. That comes first. Meanwhile, I'll get up there as
quick as I can. Subway express is the quickest. I'll be at the
meeting place in twenty-five minutes. After you've talked to
Schelling, find out from the telephone company who lives at 33
Ingoldsby Avenue. Use my name."</p>

<p>Lee met Schelling at the corner of two empty streets. It was
one of the pleasanter neighbourhoods of the Bronx, removed from
the crowded blocks of flats. Across the road stretched the dark
expanse of Bronx Park with street lamps at intervals. "Anything
new?" asked Lee. "No," said Schelling. "When I left Cagey was
still watching the house. Waiting for the lights to go out."</p>

<p>He led Lee across into the Park, which sloped down from the
street level. For a few hundred feet they followed one of the
footpaths which ran parallel with the street above. The other
side of the street was lined with a row of semi-detached suburban
houses. It was not yet midnight, and there was still a few
couples sitting on the park benches, or strolling along. Watching
his chance, Schelling pulled Lee behind a clump of shrubbery at a
moment when they were unobserved. From this dump they gained
another, nearer to the street fence, and so came to the spot
where Schelling had left his mate on watch. "Vosper's gone!" he
whispered.</p>

<p>A moment later they discovered him lying in the spot where
Cagey had been.</p>

<p>"Cagey's just gone across the road," Vosper whispered. "He
sneaked around behind Thirty-three. The lights have gone
out."</p>

<p>"This lad's line is more likely to be murder than robbery,"
said Lee. "Quick! we must divide here. Schelling, you go in
search of a policeman. Vosper, you sneak back under the fence and
cut across the street below, where he can't see you. I'll go the
other way. Work back under the rear walls of the houses and we'll
meet at the back door of Thirty-three!"</p>

<p>Lee ran along under the fence for a hundred feet, then made
his way across the street and between two of the houses opposite.
He thought: For an amateur this is getting too close to crime.
The backyards had been thrown into a community garden; there were
no fences. A certain amount of light from the street struck in
between each pair of houses. Lee crept back along a garden path
towards Thirty-three. As he approached the house, he sensed
Vosper coming from the other direction.</p>

<p>There was a little platform at each kitchen door and on the
platform of Thirty-three rose a dark object which might have been
a garbage can. But certain movements betrayed it. It was Cagey
squatting down, apparently working at the lock of the kitchen
door. As Lee drew closer the door opened. Cagey stood up and took
a swift survey of the garden while Lee flattened himself against
the wall. Cagey entered the house, leaving the door open.</p>

<p>Lee and Vosper ran silently for the steps. Lee got there
first. "Watch out! Watch out!" Vosper whispered urgently, but
Lee, disregarding the warning, sprang up the steps and ran into
the kitchen. "There's a robber in the house!" he called out.
"Turn on lights!"</p>

<p>They heard a thump, as of somebody leaping out of bed
upstairs, then silence in the dark house. Somewhere near, they
knew. Cagey was crouching, breathing fast. The plan of the little
house was apparent at a glance. Lee and Vosper were in the
kitchen. As they faced the front, there was a swing door into the
dining room to the left and a door into the hall to the right.
This door stood open. Looking through the hall they could see the
street lights through the panes of the front door. Lee and Vosper
waited, one on each side of the hall door. Vosper had a gun in
his hand.</p>

<p>Upstairs a switch clicked, and the lower hall was flooded with
light. They saw the natty figure of Cagey crouching near the foot
of the stairs. His dark face was like a wax mask, only the eyes
alive. Holding his gun poised, his eyes darted this way and that,
but he could find nothing to shoot at. He backed to the front
door. "Lend me your gun," whispered Lee to Vosper. The gun was
shoved into his hand, and he slipped noiselessly through the
swing door into the dining-room. There was an arched opening
between dining-room and living-room, and on the right of the
living-room, another arch into the hall. By creeping around the
wall. Lee got within ten feet of Cagey; near enough to see the
young man's breast rising and falling with his panting breath.
Cagey with his free hand was feeling behind him for the lock of
the front door. Lee said: "Drop your gun! I have you covered."
Instead of obeying, Cagey dived for the stairs, and started
scrambling up on all fours. Lee could not shoot because of the
intervening banisters. A gun barked from the head of the stairs.
Cagey rose to his full height with his arms flung above his head.
He crashed over backwards and slid to the foot, where he lay
huddled with blood running down his face and on to the gay orange
tie. He was dead. His gun had flown out of his hand. Lee walked
out, and picking it up stood looking down at him. Vosper joined
him from the kitchen. "A handsome lad," muttered Lee. "Too bad he
couldn't have been used for a better purpose."</p>

<p>Hearing a sound from the top of the stairs, he looked up. He
saw a grey-faced man in pyjamas with a gun hanging down from his
shaking hand. It was George Hillman. The two men stared at each
other. Lee, who was fond of saying that nothing could surprise
him, was, for once, brought up all standing. Hillman gasped out:
"Mr. Mappin...how did you get here?"</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" said Lee.</p>

<p>"I live here, sir."</p>

<p>Lee looked around at the expensively furnished rooms with a
grim expression. He indicated the body at his feet. "Do you know
this man?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! No, sir!" protested Hillman breathlessly. "I never
saw him before. He is just a robber, a common robber. He broke
into my house; he had a gun in his hand; I had a right to shoot
him."</p>

<p>"Surely," said Lee. "Come down and look at him closer."</p>

<p>Hillman slowly descended the stairs. It sickened him to look
at the corpse. "I never saw him before! I swear it!"</p>

<p>"You were expecting some such attack?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! No, sir! Why should anybody attack me?"</p>

<p>"That's what I want to know...Why the gun?"</p>

<p>"I'm a timid man, sir. I always keep a gun handy."</p>

<p>"Why did he choose this house instead of one of the others?
What have you of special value that he was after?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir, nothing! You can search the place and see for
yourself." They heard steps on the porch outside and there was a
heavy pounding on the front door. It was Schelling bringing a
policeman. Soon afterwards two more officers arrived in a radio
car. The neighbours in various states of undress, gathered on the
porch peeping through the windows with inquisitive and terrified
eyes.</p>

<p>The body was removed to the police station, and the whole
party accompanied it. This was very awkward for Lee, who dreaded
the exposure of a scandal that would involve Gavin Dordress. Lee
said that he was on his way to see Hillman about a matter
concerning his late master's affairs. He had seen the dead man
acting suspiciously and had called on two strangers (Vosper and
Schelling) for aid. Vosper and Schelling lied as to the nature of
their occupations. Hillman was only too glad to support this
story. He produced a licence to carry a gun. Lee noted that it
was dated a month before. The affair was treated as a simple
burglary. The butler was allowed to go on his own recognisance.
Indeed, the police lieutenant congratulated him on his presence
of mind. The dead man was removed to the Morgue to await
identification.</p>

<p>When they left the police station Lee sent Vosper and
Schelling home, and took Hillman into a saloon on Fordham Avenue.
Lee had reason to believe that Mrs. Hillman wore the trousers of
the family, and he wanted to question the husband alone. Hillman
was obviously dreading it. He swallowed a shot of whisky to give
him courage. "Hillman," began Lee, "where did you get the money
to live in such style?"</p>

<p>"My wife and I operate a restaurant," Hillman answered
nervously. "I told you that, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't," said Lee. "You told me you had paid
something down on a restaurant, and still required a large sum to
conclude the deal."</p>

<p>"We took possession when I made the first payment. I just
omitted to state that. I wasn't trying to deceive you, Mr.
Mappin."</p>

<p>"An important omission," said Lee. "Where did you get the
money to make the first payment?"</p>

<p>"It was the savings of a lifetime, Mr. Mappin. I have been
putting by money since I was a boy."</p>

<p>"How could you keep a family on a hundred and fifty a month
and put by money?"</p>

<p>"My wife helped me. She works, too."</p>

<p>In Lee's report on the Hillman's there had been no mention
that Mrs. Hillman was a wage-earner.</p>

<p>"How much did you pay down?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Only one thousand dollars, sir. We are paying off the balance
out of earnings."</p>

<p>"Where is this restaurant?"</p>

<p>"On Jerome Park Avenue, Mr. Mappin. It is called
Harvest's."</p>

<p>"Who did you buy it from?"</p>

<p>"Howard Harvest, sir. His address is &mdash; Webster
Avenue."</p>

<p>"Why did you never tell Mr. Dordress that you were engaging in
business?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I was afraid Mr. Dordress might resent it because I
was getting ready to leave him. I had been working for him nine
years, you see."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you leave him?"</p>

<p>"I just couldn't bring myself to it, Mr. Mappin. After nine
years it was like second nature to me to be waiting on Mr.
Dordress."</p>

<p>"Never mind the nine years," said Lee. "Tell me plainly why,
when you were in receipt of a good income from the restaurant,
you were willing to go on slaving for twelve or fourteen hours a
day for a hundred and fifty a month."</p>

<p>"I wasn't sure we could make a go of the restaurant," said
Hillman faintly.</p>

<p>"Have you been stealing from Mr. Dordress?" asked Lee bluntly.
"No, sir! No, sir!" protested Hillman. "How can you say such a
thing, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"If you have been guilty of any minor crimes you had better
say so."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, I haven't committed any crimes," wailed Hillman.
"How can you think such things of me?"</p>

<p>"People don't get rich so quick, honestly," said Lee. "I'll
tell you why you were willing to go on working for Mr. Dordress.
You were afraid that if he learned how well fixed you were, he
would take you out of his will."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, that's a fact," admitted Hillman. "It was natural,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Lee's forefinger shot out. "Then you did know that you were
down in Mr. Dordress' will."</p>

<p>Hillman's face turned ashy when he perceived the slip he had
made. "I didn't so to speak know it," he stammered. "I only hoped
that Mr. Dordress would remember me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dordress was a younger man than you. In the natural
course of things he would have outlived you." Hillman was silent.
"Were you going to work on for him indefinitely on the chance of
collecting your legacy?"</p>

<p>"I just didn't think the thing through, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"I believe that you did think it through. I believe that you
determined to make sure of your legacy before you gave up your
job."</p>

<p>"No, sir! No, sir! No, sir!" cried Hillman frantically. "Such
a thought never entered my head, Mr. Mappin! I won't touch a cent
of the money now! I don't need it, anyhow. I have my
restaurant."</p>

<p>"The restaurant is entirely yours, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes...No...It will be! It will be!"</p>

<p>Lee studied the abject creature with a frown. It came to him
that he never would be able to break him down. The butler might
stutter and turn pale and weep, but he was borne up by some
secret assurance. Perhaps because he knew Lee had no direct
evidence against him. There had been no witness to his crime. But
Lee was far from giving up as yet. "Hillman," he said softly,
"was the money for the restaurant or any part of it supplied by
Miss Garrett?"</p>

<p>By Hillman's glance of panic Lee knew he had made a strike.
"No, sir! No, sir! What for should Miss Garrett advance me
money?"</p>

<p>"I'm asking you."</p>

<p>"No, sir! Miss Garrett hasn't no use for me at all, Mr.
Mappin. None whatever! Specially lately since I had orders from
Mr. Dordress not to admit her to the apartment if he was there
alone. I've had to take the rough side of Miss Garrett's tongue,
sir. You have only, to ask her what she thinks of me and you'll
get an earful."</p>

<p>Lee studied him. He saw that he had Hillman badly worried, and
determined to leave him in that condition. He got up saying: "Are
you coming to work to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, Mr. Mappin. That is, if you want me."</p>

<p>"I want you."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be there, sir."</p>

<p>On his way home Lee telephoned Stan Oberry to assign a man to
watch Hillman. "I don't think he's going to run for it, he's got
too much at stake. However, let's not take any chances."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">CHAPTER XII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Lee got back to the Madison Avenue house he
found Joe Dietz on duty in the elevator. "Joe," he said, "you
have been shooting off your mouth too much about the death of Mr.
Dordress."</p>

<p>"No, sir!" protested Joe. "I never said a word!"</p>

<p>"Don't lie to me," said Lee. "I know." Joe stared as if Lee
had exhibited supernatural powers.</p>

<p>Up in the penthouse, Cynthia, hearing the door dose, came out
of her room in dressing-gown and slippers to meet him. Lee
scolded her affectionately. She had a report that had been sent
around from Stan Obeny's office earlier in the night, and she was
curious to learn the contents. Lee read it aloud. "This morning
when I was working out the lay of the Townley apartment in the
Andorra, I saw that Mr and Mrs. Townley's bedroom had two windows
on the Sixty-sixth Street side of the building, and a third
window opening on a court. I noticed from the street that this
third window was open. It was faced by a similar window across
the court also open, and this gave me the idea that the quarrel
between the Townleys might have been overheard by their
neighbours across the court. I located the apartment that the
window belonged to, and presented myself there in the guise of a
canvasser.</p>

<p>"The master and mistress were out and the maid had time on her
hands. She was willing to gossip. She doesn't know the name of
the people across the court. She didn't hear their quarrel last
night because she sleeps at the other end of the apartment. This
morning she was attracted into her mistress's bedroom by hearing
a woman scream across the court. She said a woman was having
hysterics over there; kept crying out that somebody was dead and
she would never see him again. There was a man in the room who
was in a rage because the woman was carrying on so. The maid
couldn't distinguish what he said, but she distinctly heard the
woman cry out: 'You killed him! You killed him! You murderer!'
Apparently the man then left the room, and the woman continued to
have hysterics on the bed. I haven't been able to approach any of
the Townley servants. Tappan, night doorman at the Andorra, who
gave me information this morning, has disappeared. I believe that
Townley is taking care of him to keep him from talking further.
A. A."</p>

<p>"Very questionable evidence," said Lee with a shrug. "It bears
no relation to what happened to-night. Gavin cannot have been
killed by two different people." He told her of the night's
events. "Another killing!" murmured Cynthia. "This man was no
loss," said Lee coolly. "I am sorry his mouth was stopped only
because he would have made a valuable witness."</p>

<p>Lee made hot drinks for Cynthia and himself to induce sleep.
While they sipped them in the studio he went over his case. "Take
Hillman. He had free access to Gavin. He had the best
opportunity. Yet he is such a timid fellow, it is difficult to
believe that he could have killed a man in cold blood."</p>

<p>"You saw him kill a man to-night," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"That was different. That man was advancing on him with a
drawn gun."</p>

<p>"Hillman has been bought."</p>

<p>"Obviously. In addition to the temptation furnished by his own
legacy, he has been receiving large sums from some sources. Gail
Garrett is indicated. The restaurant apparently has been paid
for. Working on this basis, we must assume that Gail hired
Hillman to do the thing, and that after it was done, either
because his demands were too exorbitant, or simply because he
knew too much, she took steps to have him put out of the
way."</p>

<p>"That is how it looks to me," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Still I am not satisfied that it was Hillman who fired the
fatal shot," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He has told us that he went home a few minutes after you
left. The elevator boy was vague as to the exact time, but put it
at half an hour. It would have taken an hour or more to destroy
the play in that careful manner. By the way, it is a strange
thing that only the title of the play was left unconsumed. It
suggests that the murderer wished us to know what he had
destroyed."</p>

<p>"That would be a characteristic gesture of Gall's," murmured
Cynthia. "That may be right."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't Hillman who fired the shot, who was it?"</p>

<p>"The professional killer. In that case Hillman admitted him
earlier in the evening and left him in the apartment to do his
work. Afterwards Cagey could have gone down the stairs, and let
himself out of the building without disturbing the sleeping
elevator boy."</p>

<p>Cynthia thought this over.</p>

<p>"But, Lee," she objected, "if Dad was in the studio all the
time, how could Cagey have got his gun?"</p>

<p>"Hillman could have taken it when Gavin was out of the room
and handed it to Cagey."</p>

<p>"No fingerprints."</p>

<p>"They would wear gloves."</p>

<p>Cynthia nodded. "Yes, that hangs together."</p>

<p>"But we lack definite proof," said Lee. "We must keep all
other possibilities in mind until the proof is
forthcoming...There is a thing in Hillman's favour that sticks in
my mind."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"You have seen how timid he is, and how incapable of brazening
things out. Yet Joe Dietz told me that when Hillman came to work
early this morning he looked just the same as usual; he did not
seem to be disturbed about anything."</p>

<p>"Maybe Joe Dietz is Hillman's accomplice."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Because when I was questioning Hillman to-day
he suggested that Joe Dietz might be implicated. He would not
have done that in the case of an accomplice."</p>

<p>"What are the other possibilities you have in mind?"</p>

<p>"There is Joe Dietz. I have not by any means eliminated him.
We know that he is a worthless character who spends more money
than he earns honestly. Gavin, who was kind to everybody, had
befriended the boy, and Joe had visited the apartment. If Joe had
come to the door last night Gavin would no doubt have admitted
him. This is all surmise, of course. It is hard to imagine such a
weedy youth committing so bold a crime. And Joe could hardly have
been clever enough to have found Gavin's letter, and to have
planted it to cover his crime. More likely the elevator boy was
merely an accessory; that he brought somebody else up to the
penthouse last night, and has been well paid to keep his mouth
shut."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Cynthia very low.</p>

<p>"Figure it out for yourself. Emmett Gundy, for instance."</p>

<p>"Emmett has an alibi."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Lee dryly, "but in the business of
investigating crime you learn to distrust alibis. There is
nothing to support Emmett's alibi but the word of Miss Kip."</p>

<p>"You surely don't think that Louella could have had a hand
in..."</p>

<p>"In murder?" put in Lee. "Certainly not. But she is a soft and
gentle woman, and completely infatuated with Emmett. He may have
forced her to lie for him."</p>

<p>"He had no motive," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"None that we know of," agreed Lee, "unless the sheer hatred
of an envious and disappointed man for one who had out-stripped
him was a sufficient motive."</p>

<p>"Dad has been supporting him."</p>

<p>"All right. Put it down in Emmett's favour that he had no
known motive. Next we must consider Siebert Ackroyd."</p>

<p>Cynthia flushed painfully. "Lee, it could not have been
Siebert," she murmured. "It could not have been!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"My heart tells me so."</p>

<p>"My dear, the heart is not a reliable guide in such matters. I
must go by logic."</p>

<p>"What have you got against Siebert?"</p>

<p>"He is only a possibility. He was raging against Gavin last
night, and there are three hours of his time that he can't
account for. That's all."</p>

<p>"Mack Townley is a much more likely person."</p>

<p>"True. Mack is a man of unbridled passions. He made threats
against Gavin. He was obviously beside himself with rage last
night. What is more, he lied to me about his movements after
leaving here. To-day his actions and his appearance were highly
suspicious."</p>

<p>"There is also his wife's accusation."</p>

<p>"I don't attach much weight to that. A hysterical woman is
capable of making such a charge without any evidence. I believe
she was surmising just as we are."</p>

<p>"One can surmise the truth, Lee."</p>

<p>"Surely. But it's not evidence."</p>

<p>"Mack Townley is rich. He can suppress unfavourable evidence
and produce false evidence in his own favour."</p>

<p>"I have it in mind, my dear."</p>

<p>When he undressed for bed, sleep was still far from Lee's
eyes. He was in Gavin's bare bedroom&mdash;Gavin favoured a
Spartan simplicity in his sleeping arrangements, and a sense of
his lost friend was strong with Lee; Gavin's droll smile; his
rather slow and quizzical manner of speaking; the suggestion of
sadness in his eyes though he was the most serene of men, and
quick to laughter. Lee remembered his first sight of Gavin, a
long-legged youth on the campus, with eyes that saw what they
looked at. For Lee, Gavin had never changed; always the youth of
twenty.</p>

<p>Realising that he must have some sleep in order to cope with
the next day's work, Lee swallowed one of the barbital tablets
that he kept by him for such an emergency. He got into bed and
slowly sank into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>He found himself struggling from under a load of sleep with
terror in his heart. Something dreadful had penetrated to his
consciousness. He threw his legs out of bed and thrust his feet
in slippers. He ran out of his room and across the hall that
separated him from Cynthia's room. Her door was open. He felt for
the light switch and turned it. Her bed was empty. Running
blindly through the corridor, he stumbled over her body lying on
the floor of the foyer. He found the lights and, dropping beside
her, gathered her in his arms.</p>

<p>She had fainted. She came to her senses in his arms and clung
to him like a child. "O, Lee! There was somebody here!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had a dream," he said soothingly.</p>

<p>"No, Lee! I heard him. And then I saw him. I called for you,
and then like a fool I fainted. I ought to have caught him and
held him."</p>

<p>"Where was he?"</p>

<p>Cynthia pointed to the sunroom.</p>

<p>Lee, half believing it to be a hallucination, turned on lights
in the sunroom. There lay a flowerpot smashed on the tile floor;
the garden door was standing open. "I had left my door open,"
Cynthia went on; "I heard something out in the middle of the
apartment."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you call me then?"</p>

<p>"I thought I might be mistaken. I went out into the foyer. He
was in the studio then. I could see the faint reflections of a
flashlight in there. He came out. He had turned out his light.
Just a shadow of a man. It was then that I called you. He dashed
out through the sunroom. That's all I can remember."</p>

<p>Returning to his room. Lee threw on a warm dressing-gown, and
snatched up gun and flashlight. Cynthia insisted on accompanying
him into the garden, and he could not prevent her. The key to the
garden door was hanging in its usual place beside the doorframe.
There was a second key sticking in the lock of the door. Lee took
the key and closed the door so that the intruder could not slip
back into the apartment while he was looking for him in the
garden.</p>

<p>Ten minutes search satisfied him that the man was no longer
there. "Where could he have gone?" murmured Cynthia. "We are two
hundred feet above the street."</p>

<p>"Either he flew away," said Lee dryly, "or he climbed the wall
to the adjoining building. I favour the latter explanation."</p>

<p>They returned to the apartment. Any further sleep that night
was out of the question. "Could it have been Hillman?" suggested
Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Hillman had the run of the apartment all day, and he's coming
back in the morning. Why should he sneak in in the middle of the
night?"</p>

<p>"No, it was not Hillman," she said. "A heavy, hulking figure,
with stooped shoulders and a strange skull cap pulled close over
his head." She shivered. "Somewhere I have seen such a figure,
but I can't remember...I can't remember."</p>

<p>"What kind of a building is it next door?" said Lee. "I never
happened to notice."</p>

<p>"An office building."</p>

<p>"It's four o'clock. Such a building would be locked up at this
hour. I don't see how anybody could get in."</p>

<p>"Then what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think that he had been waiting out in the garden all
evening for a chance to come in. Perhaps he didn't know that
anybody would be sleeping in the apartment to-night until he got
on the roof and saw the lights."</p>

<p>Cynthia shivered. "He's been watching me all evening
then."</p>

<p>"My first job is to discover what he was after," said Lee.
"Yesterday I made a complete mental inventory of the contents of
the studio. I ought to be able to tell if anything has been
taken."</p>

<p>Like an experienced hound Lee nosed about the big room,
subjecting every inch of it to examination, while Cynthia huddled
in an easy-chair watching him. The drawers of the big desk, the
cupboards, the bookshelves, he omitted nothing. It was full
daylight before he came to an end, and threw up his hands in
defeat. "Nothing is missing. So far as I can tell everything in
the room is exactly as it was yesterday."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Hillman arrived. He was calmer today; better
able to meet their eyes. It was impossible to believe that he
could have been the early morning intruder.</p>

<p>When they had eaten breakfast Lee obstinately renewed his
search of the studio. "The explanation must be here," he
insisted.</p>

<p>In the end he came to Cynthia with a little ornamental wooden
box in his hand. It contained a set of carved ivory chessmen.
"You have found something?" she said anxiously. "Yes," he said,
"but it only deepens the mystery. Gavin's set of chessmen has
been taken away and another left in its place. The thief put the
new ones in the old box. That's why I didn't discover the
substitution before."</p>

<p>"The clicking of the pieces was the first sound that I heard,"
murmured Cynthia.</p>

<p>"These are similar to the others," Lee went on, "but the
design of each piece is a little different. Notice that the
castle is shorter and thicker through; the head of the knight
more skilfully carved. I should never have discovered the
substitution had I not been so familiar with the old set."</p>

<p>"It was the murderer!"</p>

<p>"So it would seem. Nobody else would have taken such a
risk."</p>

<p>"What could he have wanted them for?"</p>

<p>"God knows, my dear! There is no mystery about Gavin's
chessmen. He's had the set for twenty-five years. I remember well
when he bought it. It cost fifteen dollars. That was a big sum
for a college boy to lay out. Gavin had become crazy about the
game. He undertook to teach me, but I had not patience enough to
make a good player. We will have to find the missing chessmen
before we can hope to discover why they were taken."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Hillman next had occasion to enter the
studio, the chessmen were lying exposed on a table. Cynthia
watched the servant's face. "Hillman, Mr. Dordress was a great
chess-player, wasn't he?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he answered readily. "Mr. Dordress was very
partial to the game."</p>

<p>"With whom did he play?"</p>

<p>"Lately he had been complaining that he had nobody to play
with, sir."</p>

<p>"And before that?"</p>

<p>"He used to play with Mr. Siebert Ackroyd, sir."</p>

<p>Cynthia paled. "Mr. Ackroyd used to drop in evenings," Hillman
went on. "Mr. Dordress said he had the makings of an A1 player.
But he hasn't been for some time past."</p>

<p>"Anybody else?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Miss Garrett, sir. Mr. Dordress taught her the game several
years ago. I fancy she wasn't a very good player. Mr. Dordress
would give her a handicap and then beat her. They used to play in
the late afternoons or on Sunday evenings."</p>

<p>"Anybody else?"</p>

<p>"Not that I can recollect, sir."</p>

<p>"How about Mr. Gundy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I have never seen him play with Mr.
Dordress."</p>

<p>"Or Mr. Townley?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Mr. Townley was too full of business. He never
dropped it just to pass the time with Mr. Dordress. He always had
business."</p>

<p>"Are these the chessmen that Mr. Dordress ordinarily played
with?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Why yes, sir. He never owned but the one set."</p>

<p>"All right, thank you, Hillman. That's all now."</p>

<p>The servant cast a glance of sharp curiosity at the little
ivory figures. "Excuse me, sir, but have you learned anything
from these?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Lee.</p>

<p>When he had gone out Cynthia said: "The chessmen meant nothing
to him."</p>

<p>"That is obvious," said Lee.</p>

<p>"O, dear!" she complained, "everything we have learned to-day
seems to cancel out everything we learned yesterday. Can you see
any light?"</p>

<p>"A crack or two," he answered, smiling. "It is possible that
the principal in this affair employed several agents to carry out
his plan..."</p>

<p>"Or her plan," murmured Cynthia. "It has already been
suggested that there were two such agents; there may have been
more. Perhaps no one of these agents was informed of what the
others were up to."</p>

<p>They went out into the roof garden to see what further clues
daylight might reveal. A dull rumble of traffic arose from the
street below, punctuated by the occasional squawk of a motor
horn. Except for the evergreen hedges the garden wore the bleak
dress of winter. The gravel paths revealed no trace of footsteps.
In a broad box of earth outside the window of Cynthia's room, Lee
found the print of a big hand. It had been encased in a glove.
"He was leaning forward here to peep between the slats of the
Venetian blinds," said Lee.</p>

<p>Cynthia shivered.</p>

<p>Lee covered the hand-print. Later in the day he took a cast of
it with plaster of paris. In order to reach the box the man had
had to force his way through the growing evergreens. Lee,
examining them through a magnifying glass, carefully collected
some woollen hairs clinging to the spiny foliage.</p>

<p>All along the back of the garden ran the wall of the adjoining
building, some fifteen feet higher than the garden. Gavin had
covered it with a wooden lattice over which vines might be
trained in summer. Lee said the man could not have climbed down
and climbed back by the lattice. The interstices were too small
to provide a toe hold. "Very likely he used a rope ladder," said
Lee. "The supports of the tank on the roof next door would
provide a convenient place to tie his ladder." Lee was presently
able to point out the exact spot where the man had come down and
gone back again. The painted lattice showed scuff marks. "The
rope ladder," said Lee, "would have a tendency to throw him
against the lattice, especially if he was in a hurry."</p>

<p>Back in the house, Lee put the hairs he had picked up under a
microscope. After examination he said: "It was a cheap material
that contained wool and jute. Light brown or yellowish in
colour."</p>

<p>"A yellow overcoat!" murmured Cynthia, staring. "Now I
remember, Lee. As I stood on the corner Sunday night a man
wearing a strange-looking yellow overcoat passed me. He had a
leather helmet drawn over his head...Lee!...Lee! That was the man
who broke in here last night. That was my father's murderer
I...O, God! Lee, he must have been on his way to kill him
then!"</p>

<p>"Would you know him if you saw him?"</p>

<p>"O, Heavens, yes! Every detail of his appearance seems to be
etched on my brain!"</p>

<p>Lee, feeling that he had reached a point where he required the
assistance of the police, drove down to Headquarters to talk to
Inspector Loasby, the chief of the detective force. Cynthia went
to her work at the New York Hospital. Lee's relations with the
police were peculiar. On several occasions be had given Loasby
valuable help, and the latter was presumably grateful. When a
case broke. Lee had always retired gracefully and let Loasby take
the credit. The Inspector could not understand Lee's desire to be
known as an author rather than a detective. Privately, he
considered Lee a bit cracked.</p>

<p>Loasby was a handsome man and a first-rate detective officer
in the modern scientific manner. Perhaps he lacked something of
imagination, but Lee considered that just as well in a public
official. At Headquarters Lee found him up to his neck in the
detail of the day's business, but Loasby, knowing that Lee was no
trifler, put everything aside to listen to his story. Lee did not
feel that it was incumbent on him to tell Loasby all he surmised,
but he gave him the facts. When he came to an end the Inspector's
jaw was hanging down. "Good God, Mappin, there's dynamite in this
case! Gavin Dordress, Gail Garrett, Mack Townley, Bea Ellerman.
What a bunch of headliners! We'll have to be damn' careful before
we move!"</p>

<p>"Are you telling me?" said Lee.</p>

<p>Loasby agreed that it would be better for the police to take
no official cognizance of the case until Lee had secured more
evidence. In the meantime Loasby put the resources of the
department at Lee's disposal, and Lee, on his part, agreed to
keep the Inspector fully informed.</p>

<p>Lee's first request was for a search to be made for the
missing set of chessmen. He described the ivory figures and asked
(a) that the catch basins of the sewers in the vicinity of Gavin
Dordress' apartment be cleaned out; (b) that the employees of the
Department of Sanitation be instructed to watch for the chessmen
in all receptacles of rubbish and garbage that were put out to be
emptied; (c) that a description of the chessmen be broadcast to
all policemen on patrol, and that the pawnshops be searched. Lee
also handed to the Inspector the key he had found in the garden
door of the penthouse. It was to be photographed and a circular
printed and sent to every locksmith in the city with the object
of learning who had made such a key.</p>

<p>Returning up-town, Lee visited the tall, narrow office
building next door to the apartment house. Before making his
presence known, he went up to the top floor, where he found a
flight of stairs leading up. At the top was a door opening on the
roof, furnished with an ordinary spring lock. By pressing down
the catch on the lock, anybody could go out on the roof and
return whenever he had a mind to. The roof offered no distinctive
features. On the base of the iron standard supporting the water
tank, Lee could distinguish marks where a rope or rope ladder had
been tied.</p>

<p>He looked up the Superintendent of the building. Posing as a
private detective, Lee said: "The apartment of the late Mr.
Dordress was entered last night. Apparently the thief lowered
himself from the roof of your building."</p>

<p>"What did he get?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. He was scared off."</p>

<p>The Superintendent told Lee that his building was kept open
until 11.30 to suit the convenience of a School of Telegraphy on
the top floor, which conducted classes every night of the week.
There were two sessions: 7 to 9 and 9 to 11. The School was
closed about 11.30 and the elevator man went home at the same
time. Thereafter the outer door of the building was locked. There
was a watchman who was required to visit every floor of the
building four times between midnight and 8 am.</p>

<p>The Superintendent admitted that it would be possible for
anybody who was familiar with the movements of the watchman to
slip past him on his rounds. In fact, the watchman had reported
on Monday morning, and again this morning (Tuesday), that he had
found the front door of the building unlocked after he had locked
it. For the coming night, a second man had been engaged to sit in
the entrance hall while the other was making his rounds. "He's
hardly likely to come back again," said Lee dryly. "Best to say
nothing about this for the present."</p>

<p>"You bet your life," said the Superintendent. "I don't want
any unfavourable publicity for my building."</p>

<p>The night elevator boy came on duty in the middle of the
afternoon, and Lee returned later, to talk to him. He was a keen
boy, immediately interested when Lee questioned him. Feeling his
way from question to question, Lee finally got this story out of
him. "Last Wednesday or Thursday, I can't be sure, I carried a
funny-looking guy up to the Telegraph School. I marked him
particular, he was such a dumb, foreign-looking cluck; most of
the students up there are smart young American fellows. The first
time he come he only stayed a few minutes and I took him down
again. He come back Sunday night about a quarter to eleven. I
told him the school would be closing in a few minutes, but he
said he only wanted to register, and there was time enough for
that. So I took him up."</p>

<p>"Did you bring him down again?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I didn't see him going down, but there's such a crowd when
the school lets out I might easy miss seeing somebody. But I
don't think I would have missed that funny-looking guy."</p>

<p>"Did you see him last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Last night he come in time for the nine o'clock
session."</p>

<p>"Did you carry him down again?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Now that you ask me, I never saw him again. I forgot
about him."</p>

<p>"Describe him."</p>

<p>"Well, he was a tall fellow and heavy-built; kind of stooped
in the shoulders; almost like he had a hump-on his back. I
couldn't tell you the colour of his eyes. He wore thick glasses
that made his eyes funny-looking. He couldn't see very good; kind
of felt his way along. Clean shaven. He was a Yiddisher. Talked
broken. He had on a big overcoat, kind of yellowish, that hung,
on him like a sack. You couldn't buy such an overcoat in this
town. He musta brought it over from the other side. And a leather
helmet; come right down over his head."</p>

<p>"Very good description." said Lee. "What age man?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you. Mister. He wasn't young and he wasn't
old."</p>

<p>"Would you know him again?"</p>

<p>"I sure would...What's he wanted for, Boss?"</p>

<p>"Trying to break into the apartment next door...If you value
your job, say nothing about it."</p>

<p>"I get you." said the boy, grinning.</p>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">LEE returned to the apartment. At the end of the
day Stan Oberry sent around a batch of reports. There was nothing
new on Mack Townley. He had slept at the Federal League Club. In
the morning he had visited his apartment, and had then returned
to the club where he had remained hidden all day. Joe Dietz had,
as usual, spent most of his day in the poolroom. He had refused
to talk about the Dordress case to-day, and had appeared uneasy
and suspicious. Gail Garrett had not left her apartment in the
Conradi-Windermere all day. Stan's operative, Vosper, armed with
a letter of introduction from Lee to the President, had visited
the Farmers and Merchants Bank where Gail kept her account.
Vosper had been furnished with some significant figures. On
October 10th, Miss Garrett's balance had stood at $18,000, and
she had since made large weekly deposits. But she had drawn out
no less than $35,000, which had been paid to her personally, in
cash, $5,000 at a time; her present balance was less than
$1,000.</p>

<p>There was nothing on Hillman since he had been at work in the
apartment all day. As a matter of fact, Schelling, who was
assigned to watch him, had been detailed to discover what he
could about the Harvest Restaurant on Jerome Park Avenue.
Schelling reported that it was a small place doing an excellent
business. Said to gross between twelve and fourteen hundred
weekly, of which the net would be in the neighbourhood, of two
hundred. It was efficiently managed by Mrs. Hillman, who spent
long hours in the place, generally leaving between one and two in
the morning. There was such a person as Howard Harvest, and
Hillman had undoubtedly bought the place from him. Hillman was
said to have paid fifteen thousand for goodwill, fixtures and
lease. When Schelling visited the address Hillman had given as
Harvest's, he found that the Harvest's had moved some weeks
before, giving out that they were going to California.</p>

<p>Oberry at Lee's request had sent a man by plane to Reno,
Nevada, to get a statement from Mrs. Mack Townley.</p>

<p>In the afternoon papers Lee read that the body of Frank Cagey
or Chigi had been identified and removed from the morgue. The
account stated that he was "lying in state" in the rooms of the
Nonpariel Social Club, while his friends prepared a gangster's
funeral for him on a grand scale. Lee was relieved to see that no
connection was suggested between the death of Gavin Dordress and
the killing of the burglar in the Bronx by Gavin's butler on the
following night. The press commiserated with the unfortunate man
who had been concerned in two such tragedies.</p>

<p>When Cynthia came in from work, Lee laid all this before her.
When she had read the reports she said:</p>

<p>"It is now certain that Hillman has paid in full for his
restaurant with money obtained from Gail Garrett."</p>

<p>"Fairly certain," agreed Lee cautiously. "I don't understand
why she paid Hillman so much since he does not seem to have taken
the principal part in the killing."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose she did with the other ten thousand?"</p>

<p>Lee shrugged. "I assume that Cagey got it."</p>

<p>At six o'clock a messenger came from Police Headquarters
bringing the missing set of chessmen. Loasby said that it had
been pledged early that morning in a pawnshop on Third Avenue.
The description of the man who had pawned it tallied with that
furnished by the elevator boy, yellow overcoat, stooped back and
all. "Nice work!" said Lee, sitting down to write the Inspector a
note of congratulation.</p>

<p>Lee set up the little red and white ivory chessmen on Gavin's
desk, and studied them piece by piece, both with the naked eye
and under a glass, while Cynthia awaited the verdict. For a long
time Lee was baffled; finally, as he studied one of the little
castles with its battlemented top, an association of ideas began
to work in his mind. From a drawer of the desk he got the little
sketch he had made of the bruise on Gavin's forehead. Pressing
the top of the castle in an inked pad that lay in Gavin's drawer,
he made an impression of it on the paper alongside his own
sketch. The two little pictures were identical; six tiny
parallelograms ranged in a circle.</p>

<p>Cynthia stared at them with widening eyes. "Lee, you are
wonderful!" she murmured. "That tells the story," said Lee.
"Gavin was playing chess with somebody at the moment he was shot.
His head sank forward and struck against this chessman. I
mentioned the bruise on Gavin's forehead to one of the reporters,
and it was printed yesterday. That is what determined the
murderer to make away with the telltale piece."</p>

<p>"Playing chess," murmured Cynthia, "...with whom?"</p>

<p>"We know of three chess-players," said Lee, grimly; "Gail
Garrett, Mack Townley and Siebert Ackroyd; there may be
others.</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been anybody but Gail," Cynthia said
sharply. "Everything points to her."</p>

<p>"Everything but the man in the yellow overcoat," said Lee. "We
haven't established any connection between him and Gail."</p>

<p>"We know that she has employed two accomplices; why not a
third?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be proven." They heard the bell ring outside,
and Hillman presently entered to say that Mr. Ackroyd was
calling. He had asked for Miss Cynthia.</p>

<p>Cynthia's face was twisted with pain. "I won't see him," she
said quickly.</p>

<p>"Better take a look at him," Lee said to Cynthia in an
undertone. "It may destroy your suspicion or confirm it."</p>

<p>Cynthia, after a painful hesitation, nodded her head. "We'll
come out to him," said Lee. He gathered up the chessmen.</p>

<p>Siebert was agitatedly pacing the foyer. His handsome face was
drawn with anxiety. He was scarcely aware of Lee's presence.
"Cyn, I had to come," he burst out. "I can't settle to anything
when you're in such trouble. How goes it?"</p>

<p>Cynthia looked at him darkly. "All right," she said
tonelessly. Evading his outstretched hand, she crossed the foyer
to the opening of the corridor, and turning around, fixed him
with her dark gaze. He was standing almost on the same spot where
she had first seen the man who had entered the night before.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Siebert blankly.</p>

<p>Lee moved quickly towards the sunroom. "Come in here a moment,
Siebert. I have something to show you."</p>

<p>Siebert strode into the sunroom, Cynthia watching every
movement. Lee took down the key to the garden door from its hook
on the door-frame and showed it to him. "Siebert, did you ever
borrow this key?"</p>

<p>Siebert's face showed purest surprise. "What are you getting
at?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I mean for the purpose of having a duplicate made," said Lee,
watching him sternly.</p>

<p>Siebert flushed red with anger. "I don't understand you."
Turning on his heel, the young man demanded of Cynthia: "What
does this mean?"</p>

<p>Lee, who did not wish to intrude on what followed, went back
into the studio. "What does this mean? What does this mean?"
Siebert kept asking.</p>

<p>Cynthia, shrinking from him, mutely shook her head. "Why do
you act so strangely? You and Lee. It isn't possible that you
suspect me of...Me?"</p>

<p>"You cursed him," she muttered.</p>

<p>Siebert clasped his hands to his head. "O, my God," he
groaned, "haven't I suffered enough on that account? I told you
how sorry I was. It meant nothing. It was only the anger of a
moment...Cynthia, I have never hidden anything from you. You must
know that I am incapable of such a thing!"</p>

<p>He paused, searching her face. Cynthia continued to look at
him distantly, and his face suddenly flamed with anger. "All
right!" he cried harshly. "I've given you the best I've got!
Maybe you're not worth it. There must be something the matter
with you, if you can so easily suspect the one who loves you. I
reckon you're incapable of loving a man. If you loved me, you
would know that I could not do this to you!" He strode out of the
apartment.</p>

<p>Lee, hearing the door, came quickly back into the foyer.
"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>Cynthia ran to him with failing steps, and falling in his
arms, burst into a passion of tears.</p>

<p>"Lee, I don't know! I don't know!" she cried. "Sometimes I
think it might have been Siebert; sometimes I am sure it was not!
Why must I be tortured so? I can't bear it!"</p>

<p>"Have courage," he said soothing her. "It won't be for long.
We will soon know."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">CHAPTER XV.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">CYNTHIA and Lee were seated at the dining-table.
Cynthia pale, and with dark circles under her eyes, was merely
playing with her food, and Lee couldn't eat because she couldn't.
They heard the bell outside, and Cynthia looked up
apprehensively. "I dread that sound!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Hillman, having gone to the door, entered to say that it was
Joe Dietz. He wanted to see Mr. Mappin. He said it was important.
Lee got up and went out into the foyer followed by Cynthia. The
elevator boy in his street clothes stood there biting his lip and
turning his hat ceaselessly between his hands. Joe was not a
beauty at any time and agitation made his sharp-featured face
look even more common and mean. "Mr. Mappin, I got to talk to
you! I got to talk to you!" he stammered.</p>

<p>Hillman was hanging around, and Lee led the way into the
studio. When the boy saw that Cynthia was coming, too, he hung
back. "Mr. Mappin, I got to see you alone."</p>

<p>"Has it got anything to do with what happened Sunday night?"
asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Then she must hear it, too. Forget that she's a woman." Lee
closed the door of the studio. "What is it, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, I lied to you yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"I suspected as much," said Lee dryly. "Give me the straight
dope now."</p>

<p>"I lied when I said there was nobody come up to Mr. Dordress'
apartment after everybody had gone. I brought up a man in the
elevator."</p>

<p>"What man?" asked Lee sharply.</p>

<p>"Frank Cagey, Mr. Mappin. But I didn't know who he was
then."</p>

<p>Lee and Cynthia looked at each other. "There was a woman come
to Mr. Dordress, too," stammered Joe.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Miss Gail Garrett, sir."</p>

<p>Cynthia dropped suddenly into a chair as if her legs had
weakened under her. "Now I know!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Lee said: "Sit down, Joe. Take it slow, and tell me the whole
story."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir." Joe sat down on the edge of a
chair, still turning his hat. "Mr. Hillman, he was the last to
leave. Miss Garrett, she come back first. It was a good while
after; about twelve, as near as I can figure. She come back. She
asked me if anybody had come to see Mr. Dordress, and I says no,
and she seemed awful glad of it. She said: 'Take me up,' and I
did."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Dordress let her in?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"No, sir. She had her own key to the apartment."</p>

<p>"You're sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, Mr. Mappin. She was in such a hurry she had the
key in her hand before she stepped out of the elevator, and she
put it right in the door."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I hadn't much more than got down to the ground floor when the
fellow, he come. He was dressed so nice I never thought anything
out of the way. He said he wanted to see Mr. Dordress, and that
he was expected, so I took him up."</p>

<p>"Who let him in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. He rang the bell of the apartment. I
couldn't hang around watching. I came down in the car."</p>

<p>"Then what happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, after a while I heard a buzz from the fifteenth floor
and I went up to get them."</p>

<p>"How long were they in the apartment?" asked Lee. "This is
important."</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you exactly, Mr. Mappin. It was a good while.
Not less than half an hour, and not more than an hour, I
guess."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"The fellow, he looked just the same as before, slick and
smooth, but the lady, she looked bad. She was all in. He had to
hold her up. I took them down in the elevator and they drove away
in a taxi."</p>

<p>"Why did you lie about this yesterday?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Because I was scared, Mr. Mappin. In the elevator this fellow
showed me a gun and said he'd fill my belly full of lead if I
ever said that he or she had been there that night."</p>

<p>"Did he give you money?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. But she did. A hundred dollars. And promised me more
if I kept my mouth shut."</p>

<p>"I see," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I didn't care nothing about the money, sir," protested Joe.
"I'm an honest boy. Ain't I telling you the truth now? But I was
scared!"</p>

<p>"What was it led you to tell the truth now?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I read in the paper as how Frank Cagey was shot up in the
Bronx last night. The name meant nothing to me, but his picture
was in the paper and I thought that was the guy. It said he was
lying in state at&mdash; Bayard Street and I went there on my way
to work. There was a crowd going in and out and nobody took no
notice of me. I went in and looked at him in his casket, and it
was the guy. So I wasn't scared of him any more. That's why I'm
telling you."</p>

<p>"I see," said Lee.</p>

<p>"What must I do now?" asked Joe nervously. "Must I talk to the
police?"</p>

<p>"All in good time," said Lee. "I'll tell you when...In the
meantime if you value your own skin keep your mouth shut. This
fellow Joe Cagey has plenty of friends, remember."</p>

<p>Joe turned pale. "Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Mappin. You can
depend upon me, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, go on to your work," said Lee.</p>

<p>When the boy had left them. Lee and Cynthia looked at each
other for a long time without speaking. "It's all clear now,"
murmured Cynthia at last. "Gail persuaded Dad to sit down to a
game of chess with her, and this murderer stole up and shot
him."</p>

<p>"So it would seem," said Lee. His voice lacked conviction. "I
don't see why Gavin didn't take alarm when he first laid eyes on
the man."</p>

<p>"He never laid eyes on him," said Cynthia. "Cagey only made
believe to ring the doorbell. Gail had fixed the latch of the
door so that he could go right in after the elevator had gone
down."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," said Lee.</p>

<p>Cynthia reached for the telephone and began to dial a number.
Lee, divining her intention, said quickly: "Better wait! We're
not sure yet!"</p>

<p>Cynthia looked at him in astonishment. "What more proof could
you want?"</p>

<p>"The man in the yellow overcoat was up here too on Sunday
night. Where does he come in?"</p>

<p>"He was another of Gail's accomplices."</p>

<p>Cynthia got her connection. "Siebert," she said into the
transmitter, and her voice broke: "Siebert, can you come over
here for a moment? I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>Evidently Siebert could and would. Cynthia hung up. "You were
too precipitate," said Lee gravely.</p>

<p>"I can't help myself, Lee," she pleaded. "I wronged him in my
mind!"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do next?" asked Lee. "Lay the
information before the police, and ask for Gail Garrett's
arrest?"</p>

<p>Cynthia looked at him in horror. "O, Lee! Think how the
tabloids will play up the story of Gail and Dad!"</p>

<p>"I don't see how it can be avoided, my dear."</p>

<p>"Don't tell the police," she urged. "Let us just tell Gail
that we know the truth, and leave her to her own conscience. That
will be punishment enough."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "I have pledged my word to Inspector
Loasby. It is my duty to tell the police everything we know.
After that it's up to them."</p>

<p>"Must you tell them right away? To-night?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night. I want to be surer of my ground first."</p>

<p>Hillman entered to ask if they would take any more dinner.
Obviously it was only an excuse; his face was tormented with
curiosity. They shook their heads, but he lingered. His curiosity
proved to be stronger than his fears. "Mr. Mappin, sir," he
blurted out, "if it's not a liberty, what did you learn from the
boy? What has happened!"</p>

<p>"Nothing conclusive," said Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin..."</p>

<p>"That will be all, Hillman."</p>

<p>The servant went out with a distracted air. "Curious,"
murmured Lee, "the pertinacity of a weak man. Hillman will face
this out to the end, though he dies a thousand deaths from sheer
fright."</p>

<p>In ten minutes Siebert was at the door of the apartment.
Cynthia ran out into the foyer; Lee remained sitting in the
studio mulling things over. "Siebert," said Cynthia imploringly.
"I'm sorry for the way I spoke and acted. Can you forgive me, and
forget it?"</p>

<p>The young man's eyes brooded over her sombrely. "I forgive
you," he said, "but I can't forget it right away. It made too
deep a mark."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry!" she murmured. "Try to put yourself in my
place. Every hour something new happens. I am dragged this way
and that. I scarcely know what I am doing."</p>

<p>"I know what you're going through," he said. "I wanted to
stand by you. But you preferred Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Why can't I have both of you?"</p>

<p>Siebert shook his head. "Mappin suspects me. Mind, I don't
blame him for that. He's got to go by logic. But you ought to
have known me better."</p>

<p>"You have not forgiven me," she said sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have! I can't help loving you whatever you do."</p>

<p>"Then it's all right," she said, slipping her arm through
his.</p>

<p>He pressed it hard against his side. "You haven't said that
you loved me," he murmured diffidently.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't ask that now," she said painfully. "There is no
room inside me now for a personal love. But I want you for my
friend."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Siebert.</p>

<p>They drifted into the sunroom with linked arms.</p>

<p>As time passed and Hillman did not appear to say that he was
going home, Lee went in search of him. He found the servant
standing in the pantry in a distracted state. "Haven't you
finished your work?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Quite finished."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you go home?"</p>

<p>"I was just going, sir." Hillman took his hat and coat from
the cupboard where they hung. "Goodnight, Mr. Mappin. Please say
good-night to Miss Cynthia for me."</p>

<p>Lee made sure that he left the apartment.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Hillman was back again, shaking with
fright. "Mr. Mappin, sir," he stuttered, "would it be all right
with you if I stayed here to-night?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Lee. "I believe there are men laying for me in
the street, sir. Friends of that man...of Cagey's. If they don't
get me here they are certain to get me in the empty streets that
surround my home. I'm afraid, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Lee. "When a thief is killed while breaking
into a house it is part of the chance he takes. You never heard
of his friends trying to avenge a killing of that sort. It is
only when a gangster is murdered by a rival that his mates look
for revenge."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," wailed Hillman.</p>

<p>"I see no reason for your staying here all night."</p>

<p>"I have a room, sir. Everything is prepared. I used to sleep
here sometimes when Mr. Dordress was alive."</p>

<p>"No, Hillman."</p>

<p>"Please! Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"It does not suit my convenience to have you sleep here," said
Lee coldly.</p>

<p>Hillman shuffled away, fairly blubbering with fright.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">EVER since Gavin's body had been carried to the
Hamilton Funeral Parlours, a curious crowd had been milling
around the establishment, and Lee, dreading the scenes at a
public funeral, had arranged to have his friend carried secretly
to a little chapel in Valhalla. There he was to be buried on
Wednesday morning. Only a dozen of Gavin's closest friends were
notified of the place and time, and all were pledged not to
divulge it to the Press.</p>

<p>Hillman arrived for work as usual on Wednesday morning. He
looked like a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown. "So you
escaped from the gangsters," Lee said dryly.</p>

<p>"It's no joke to me, Mr. Mappin," he whined. "I am watched and
followed wherever I go."</p>

<p>Lee and Cynthia breakfasted. Afterwards, while Cynthia was
making ready in her bedroom, Hillman came to Lee. "Mr. Mappin,
would it be asking too much for me to go with you this morning? I
could ride outside with the chauffeur."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Hillman looked at him in surprise, and Lee noted with
astonishment that there were tears in his eyes. But of course
there are men as well as women who can cry to order. "I...I
worked for Mr. Dordress for nine years," he stammered. "I was
very strongly attached to him."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Lee. "We will have to ask Miss Cynthia." When
Cynthia entered the room he said: "Hillman wants to know if he
may go to the funeral with us."</p>

<p>Cynthia stared at the servant. "Certainly not!" she said. "I
wonder that he has the face to speak of such a thing!" She
hurried out of the room to hide her feelings.</p>

<p>"You have your answer," said Lee to Hillman.</p>

<p>Hillman stood, an abject figure, hanging his head and twisting
his hands together. "Mr. Mappin," he whined, "surely it isn't
possible that I am suspected of...of...."</p>

<p>"O, say it out," Lee broke in. "Suspected of having had a hand
in the murder of your master. Certainly you are suspected."</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Mappin, this is too terrible!"</p>

<p>"We know that Miss Garrett has paid you large sums of money
during the last month. What was that for, if it was not to
connive at the murder of your master?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! No, sir! I have never taken a cent off Miss
Garrett!"</p>

<p>"You have paid fifteen thousand dollars for your
restaurant."</p>

<p>"No, sir! Only five thousand has been paid. That was my
savings and my wife's savings, and some we borrowed."</p>

<p>"Who did you borrow it from?"</p>

<p>"My wife took care of that, sir."</p>

<p>"How are you going to pay the balance?"</p>

<p>"Out of earnings, sir. A thousand dollars a month."</p>

<p>"The place doesn't earn that much."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to borrow again."</p>

<p>Lee smiled grimly. "Furthermore," he said, "this man Cagey
whom you shot last night was also in Miss Garrett's pay. A man of
his reputation in the criminal world doesn't rob the house of a
butler or a small restaurant keeper. What was he after?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mr. Mappin. I swear I don't know!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Lee. "Until these questions are answered you
must expect to be under suspicion."</p>

<p>Hillman went out.</p>

<p>When Cynthia returned to the room Lee's eyes dwelt on her with
affection and pain. Grief had given her beauty an other-world
quality; the clear pallor, the enlarged eyes were not like those
of a common flesh and blood woman. Her plain black dress and hat
set it off with heart-breaking poignancy. She had refused to hide
herself under a funeral veil. "Ah, my dear!...my dear!" he
murmured.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked anxiously. "Don't I look all
right?"</p>

<p>"You look like an angel! I would be more comfortable if I saw
you with red eyes and swollen nose like a common woman."</p>

<p>"I shan't cry to-day. Lee. Plenty of time for that."</p>

<p>He said: "This is going to be a painful ordeal for you."</p>

<p>Cynthia, guessing what had prompted his words, said quickly:
"She won't dare to come."</p>

<p>"She will certainly be there," said Lee gravely. "She wouldn't
dare to stay away."</p>

<p>As if to give point to his words the telephone rang. He
answered it, and over the wire he heard the slightly husky voice
that had charmed the ears of millions. "May I speak to Miss
Dordress, please."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Gail." Lee's voice was very dry. "This is Lee.
Cynthia is really in no shape to talk over the telephone. Can I
take a message for her?"</p>

<p>"Ah, the poor child! My heart is with her!"</p>

<p>"She will be grateful," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I called up to say that I was driving up to Valhalla alone
with my chauffeur. Can't I take Cynthia and you with me?"</p>

<p>"You are very kind, but we have already engaged a car. We are
taking several people with us."</p>

<p>"I see," said Gail. "Well, I'll see you up there." She hung
up.</p>

<p>Cynthia listened to half of this exchange, stiffening with
anger.</p>

<p>"She should be stopped!" she murmured. "It's not decent for
her to be there!"</p>

<p>"I will prevent her from coming if you are ready to face a
show-down," said Lee gravely.</p>

<p>"O, no!" said Cynthia, turning away. "Let him be buried
first."</p>

<p>"Why do you go?" he asked affectionately. "It's not necessary,
my dear."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to let her keep me away!" Cynthia flashed
back.</p>

<p>He said no more.</p>

<p>In Greenlawn Cemetery rain dripped slowly from the naked
branches of the trees. The grass was as vivid as freshly-applied
green paint, contrasting with the blackish green of the ivy
trained over the grave mounds. Not a dead leaf was allowed to
remain on the ground nor a spray of ivy to creep beyond its
grave; no spear of grass rose above its fellows. The place was
too well-kept; it had a smug and trivial look out of keeping with
the stark fact of death.</p>

<p>Immediately inside the gates stood a sham gothic chapel
connected by a covered way with a receiving vault. As the hour
for the ceremony approached, two spruce young undertaker's
assistants wheeled a rosewood casket through the corridor on a
nickel-plated travelling bier of the latest design. Placing it
just so at the chancel steps, they stood one on each side in
decorous attitudes of grief and watchfulness, beautifully dressed
and thoroughly pleased with themselves. The little church was
still empty and their attention wandered. One glanced at his
finger nails; the other stroked a budding moustache.</p>

<p>Fifty yards from the church waited the freshly-opened grave,
with mats of artificial grass like stage properties carefully
laid down to hide the uncovered earth, as if the sight of
anything natural in that place were an offence. A knot of village
women gathered under the portal of the church. The dead man was
nothing to them; they didn't even know his name; but it was clear
from their expressions that they enjoyed a funeral, any
funeral.</p>

<p>Two taxicabs arrived from the railway station, the first
bringing Alan Talbert, a protege of Gavin's, and two other young
men, the second two girls of a highly sophisticated type, who
smoked cigarettes incessantly, and were inclined to smile at the
barbarous funeral customs of our forefathers. They were all young
playwrights. Not liking to be the first to enter the church, they
remained standing outside along with the village women.</p>

<p>An expensive custom-built brougham drew up and Mack Townley
stepped out. All the playwrights put themselves in a posture to
attract his attention, but Mack walked between them looking
neither to right nor left, and seated himself in a side aisle as
if to avoid all contact with his kind. There was something savage
and terrible in the aspect of the ravaged face under the
conventional silk hat. The young people looked at each other in
surprise, for Mack was reputed to be an unfeeling man. Their
heads drew together; they whispered. In spite of Lee's care, word
had gone around Gavin's circle that there was something queer
about the manner of his death.</p>

<p>Two handsome limousines arrived together. From the first
stepped the very blonde Miss Gail Garrett, delicately worn, and
most beautiful in her black costume. Some of the village women
recognised her, and finding herself stared at, she dropped a long
crepe veil over her face. The gesture of the famous hand was
perfect in its grace. She waited in the vestibule for those who
were behind her. Lee Mappin, Emmett Gundy, Cynthia Dordress,
Louella Kip and Fanny Parran got out of the second car. As
Cynthia entered the vestibule, Gail drew back her veil, revealing
a face suffused with tenderness. She picked up the girl's hand,
murmuring: "Darling child!"</p>

<p>Cynthia allowed her hand to rest limply in that of the older
woman, but the eyes that rested on Gail's face blazed up with
startling intensity. She said nothing. Gail, frightened, dropped
the girl's hand, and let the veil fall back quickly. The
onlookers did not miss this brief exchange. Even the village
women felt that there was something strange about this
sparsely-attended funeral. They were repaid for coming.</p>

<p>Cynthia entered the church. Emmett Gundy on one side
solicitously supported her elbow with his hand. From the other
side of the girl Lee regarded Emmett dryly. He knew that Cynthia
detested all such displays, but he said nothing. Behind them, the
gentle Louella in a black hat that had turned rusty with age, was
unaffectedly weeping. Hers were the only tears shed. They took
places in the first pew on one side of the aisle, and Gail sat
alone on the other. Nobody could see behind the latter's crepe
veil. Cynthia looked stonily ahead of her.</p>

<p>The other people entered the church. Presently Siebert Ackroyd
drove up in his little convertible, and went in. His eyes sought
out Cynthia. Seeing her flanked on both sides, he sat down glumly
at the back of the church. Observing Emmett's officious
attentions, how he pushed up a hassock for Cynthia to kneel on,
how he found the burial service for her in the prayer book,
Siebert scowled. Over on the side aisle Mack Townley sat apart
looking at nobody.</p>

<p>The clergyman entered, and the undertaker's assistants
retreated into the background. It was an unimportant, ill-paid
clergyman, and he was not clever enough to conceal the fact that
this was an everyday matter with him. Even so, the beautiful
words of the burial service had a moving effect, and the sound of
suppressed weeping could be heard. Louella Kip's head was down,
and under the all-enveloping veil, Gail Garrett's shoulders were
shaking. Cynthia, with dry eyes, looked stonily ahead of her. "We
brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry
nothing out. The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed
be the name of the Lord."</p>

<p>When he came to the end of the first part of the service he
started slowly down the aisle, and the two young undertakers came
after, wheeling the casket. The mourners followed and after them
the sightseers. At the church door waited six soberly-clad
workmen of the cemetery who lifted the casket and bore it to the
grave. Here it hung suspended in a cradle while the service was
resumed. On one side stood Gavin's closest friends, Lee and the
four black-clad women in front, with the tall figures of Siebert
Ackroyd, Emmett Gundy and Mack Townley looking over their heads.
From the other side of the grave and a little back from it, the
eyes of the village women greedily searched the faces of the
mourners. The clergyman continued: "Man that is born of women
hath but a short time to live, and is full of mystery. He cometh
up, and is cut down like a flower, he fleeth as it were a shadow,
and never continueth in one stay."</p>

<p>As he pronounced the benediction, Gail Garrett drew from
beneath her coat a single white rose. She extended her graceful
hand, but Cynthia was too quick for her. The girl's eyes blazed
in her white face. Wrenching the flower from the other woman's
hand, she cast it on the ground and trod on it. "For shame!" she
said in a low, quivering voice.</p>

<p>All the others looked on as if turned into stone. Gail shrank
away. There was nothing theatrical in this gesture. "No! No!" she
whispered. "You are wrong! I did not! I did not!"</p>

<p>"Go!" said the blazing Cynthia, pointing to the cars.</p>

<p>Gail turned and ran stumblingly to her car. Nobody else moved.
She collapsed on her knees on the running-hoard, but contrived to
get the door open, and to drag herself inside. The car sped out
of the cemetery.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">ON his return to town, Lee went to Police
Headquarters, where he put the whole story before Inspector
Loasby. The Inspector was appalled by the task that lay before
him. "Gail Garrett!" he exclaimed. "Good God! It is terrible to
think of dragging down a name like that!"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her demoralisation at the cemetery, Gail was
actually playing the matinee at the Greenwich Theatre. Lee had
satisfied himself of that by telephone. "She has courage," he
remarked dryly.</p>

<p>"She must keep up appearances at any cost," suggested
Loasby.</p>

<p>On matinee days it was Miss Garrett's custom to remain in her
dressing-room between the two performances. She would have
friends in to a light meal that she called "tea" and would
afterwards sleep for an hour in preparation for the evening
performance. Knowing this, Lee timed his call at the theatre with
Inspector Loasby for half-past six. He wanted to save Cynthia
from the ugly scene, but she insisted on accompanying them. "My
being there will break her down quicker than all the questions of
the police," she said, and Lee submitted. Loasby was in plain
clothes.</p>

<p>On their arrival at the stage-door they were told that Miss
Garrett's friends were still with her, and they sat down on
property chairs behind the scenes to wait. Of the three the
professional police officer was the most uneasy. "I don't like
this! I don't like this!" he kept muttering. The star dressing-room
opened directly off the stage. Smiling, and apparently her
usual self, Gail came to the door to say good-bye to her friends,
and she had therefore no excuse for refusing to see these other
visitors. She silently stood away from the open door to allow
them to enter. The room was furnished as a charming boudoir in
the style of Louis Seize.</p>

<p>Gail's face changed at the sight of Cynthia. "You might at
least have spared me this until to-morrow," she said bitterly. "I
have another performance to go through with."</p>

<p>"If the people are not satisfied with your understudy their
money can be returned," said Lee bluntly. "Our business is more
important than a missed performance."</p>

<p>"Who is this gentleman?" asked Gail.</p>

<p>"Inspector Loasby of the police."</p>

<p>All the colour drained out of Gail's face. She ordered her
maid, Catherine, to wait outside, and to prevent anybody from
entering. She led the others to an inner room which was furnished
in more workmanlike fashion for the actual business of dressing
and making-up. Feigning to be pushed for time, she threw a
stained kimono over her negligee, and sat down in front of her
mirror, letting her visitors find seats where they could. Thus
she had her back to them. She drew on a cap to protect her hair,
and commenced to dab cold cream on her face. The familiar
occupation gave her courage. "What do you want of me?" she asked
in a strangled voice. The mirror was ringed with electric lights
and the smeared face reflected in it no longer looked human.</p>

<p>In the presence of the great lady of the stage, the
embarrassed Inspector looked almost guilty himself. "I am sorry
to have to say it," he muttered. "You are charged with the murder
of Gavin Dordress."</p>

<p>She expected this, of course. Her busy hands trembled
violently, but she attempted to laugh. "How perfectly ridiculous!
Who makes such a charge."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>Gail's agonised eyes were still fixed on her reflection in the
mirror. Her pretence that she had to make ready for the stage was
preposterous. "He had no basis for such a charge!" she said
shrilly. "There is no evidence! There couldn't be!"</p>

<p>The inspector looked at Lee. The latter said: "When you left
Gavin's place on Sunday night you drove home. Shortly afterwards
you left the hotel again. You were driven to the Nonpariel Social
Club in Bayard Street, where you sent in the driver to bring out
a man known as Cagey or Frank Cagey, a notorious gangster with a
reputation as a killer. You and Cagey drove away in another cab.
About a half-hour later you turned up alone at Gavin's place. You
were carried up in the elevator and let yourself into the
apartment with a key. A minute or two later Cagey came and was
admitted to the apartment. There are witnesses to swear to this.
Nobody saw Gavin alive after that."</p>

<p>Gail sprang up from her chair and paced the little room,
pressing clenched hands against her temples, a grotesque figure
with her frenzied, white-daubed face. Cynthia turned away her
head. Old habit was so strong that there was still something
theatrical in all Gail's movements. "I did not kill him!" she
cried. "I did not! I did not! But O, God! what a position I am
in! How can I prove it! Only Cagey could save me, and he is
dead!"</p>

<p>Lee was not at all moved by this display of emotion. "Quite!"
he said.</p>

<p>"Do you deny that your movements on Sunday night were as Mr.
Mappin has stated?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"No!" she said. "That much is true. You have your witnesses,
haven't you? But I did not kill him! I swear it!"</p>

<p>"You hired the man who fired the shot," said Lee.</p>

<p>"No! No! No!"</p>

<p>"How can you expect a jury to believe that?" asked the
Inspector.</p>

<p>Gail came to a stand, pressing her head between her hands.
"Listen! I'll tell you the whole story. You've got to believe
me...Listen! Listen!...It is true that I went mad on Sunday
night. I loved Gavin Dordress and he cast me off in the most
brutal and cold-blooded fashion! Me! Me!"</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" said Cynthia quickly. "My father could
not..."</p>

<p>"Quiet!" murmured Lee. "What does it matter?"</p>

<p>Gail turned on him furiously. "O, it doesn't matter what say!"
she screamed. "I am nothing, I suppose. You always hated me, Lee
Mappin..."</p>

<p>"Get on with your story," said Lee.</p>

<p>"He cast me off in the most brutal and cold-blooded fashion,"
Gail repeated, with a spiteful glance at the girl; "and I was
mad! I could not endure such a load of shame and grief. I could
not live in the same world with the man who had wronged me so. I
knew this man, Cagey&mdash;never mind how. I knew he would do
what I wanted, for money. It's true that I went to him on Sunday
night and gave him money to kill Gavin Dordress. I was
mad...mad!"</p>

<p>Cynthia's eyes widened in horror. Lee moved closer to her.
"When I went home I wrote a letter to Gavin asking for a
reconciliation," Gail continued, "and I gave that to Cagey to
deliver. I knew that Gavin would read it, perhaps answer it, and
Cagey was to shoot him then, and make his getaway..." Cynthia
threw an arm over her face. "...But the moment Cagey left me a
revulsion of feeling took place, and I was horrified at what I
had done. I attempted to pursue him in another cab, but I lost
him in the traffic. I offered my driver everything I had on me if
he got to Gavin's place first, and we made it! We got there
before Cagey did, Your witnesses told you that! I went upstairs
to beg Gavin's forgiveness. The key? I had possessed a key to his
apartment for years. I let myself in...O, God!..." Gail's voice
was choked by a dry-eyed hysterical sobbing.</p>

<p>"Go on!" said Lee sternly.</p>

<p>Holding her head, Gail dropped to her knees. "O, God!" she
moaned. Flinging herself at full length on the rug, she pounded
on the floor with her clenched hands. "Gavin was dead!" she
screamed. "Dead! Dead!...He lay in the studio with a hole in his
temple and blood spreading on the floor. His body was still warm!
O, God! if I had only had the courage to kill myself then!"</p>

<p>Lee and the Inspector exchanged a glance. The former said:
"Who killed him?"</p>

<p>Gail raised her convulsed face. "He killed himself! The gun
lay where it had slipped from his hand. It was his gun. His
letter of farewell was lying on the desk...You know he killed
himself! Could I have forged Gavin's handwriting? Or that
ignorant brute Cagey? You have only taken advantage of
appearances to bring this charge against me!"</p>

<p>"And then Cagey came," prompted Lee.</p>

<p>"He rang the bell," sobbed Gail. "I let him in because I was
afraid to leave him standing there."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I can scarcely tell you. We left together."</p>

<p>"But that was nearly an hour later. What were you doing during
that time?"</p>

<p>"I was looking for my letters. I had written Gavin many
letters; foolish, loving letters. I couldn't bear the thought of
having them read by others."</p>

<p>"Did you find them?"</p>

<p>"No. Gavin must have destroyed them."</p>

<p>"Why did you pay Hillman such large sums of money?"</p>

<p>"I never gave Hillman a cent!"</p>

<p>"Then why did you send Cagey to Hillman's house?"</p>

<p>"I didn't send him there."</p>

<p>"That I am sure is a lie," said Lee.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the rest of the story, Mr. Mappin?" the
Inspector asked, low-voiced.</p>

<p>"She is probably speaking the truth," said Lee. "It fits in
with the other circumstances that I told you of."</p>

<p>Gail, amazed, partly raised herself, and started to scramble
towards Lee's chair on her knees. "Oh, Lee! thank you for those
words," she cried. "You are my friend. You will stand by me."</p>

<p>Lee sprang up with surprising swiftness, and backed away from
his chair. "Don't touch me!" he said sternly. "You plotted to
kill my friend!"</p>

<p>"But I repented!" she wailed, beating the floor. "I got there
before Cagey. I am not guilty!" Seeing no mercy in Lee's face,
she collapsed, shaken by dry sobs.</p>

<p>Inspector Loasby said: "What action do you wish me to take,
Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>Lee said: "I suggest that you take no action for the present
in respect to her. Our business lies elsewhere."</p>

<p>They left the theatre.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">AT this point in the investigation, Lee Mappin,
after consultation with Cynthia and Inspector Loasby, changed his
tactics. Suspecting that the real murderer of Gavin Dordress was
close enough to them to be able to inform himself of all their
movements. Lee undertook to lull him into a false security by
making believe to drop the investigation. On the day following
the scene in the Greenwich Theatre, therefore. Lee and Cynthia
returned to their respective apartments; Gavin's personal effects
were stored, and the penthouse subleased to an oilman who had
made a strike in the South-west and had come to New York to spend
his gains.</p>

<p>The interest of the press in the case ceased with the funeral.
Word was dropped in the proper quarters among Gavin's friends
that there had seemed to be suspicious circumstances surrounding
his death, but that Lee Mappin, after making an investigation,
was satisfied that it was a case of suicide. Young Alan Talbert
was the principal medium used by Lee to circulate this story.
Talbert was a playwright of mediocre talents who was still among
the great unproduced, but he was a lively, talkative young fellow
and an assiduous frequenter of theatrical parties.</p>

<p>In order to cover his tracks more completely, Lee did for a
while abstain from making any moves in the case. Stan Oberry was
paid off, and his operatives recalled from their assignments. The
man sent to Reno had not been able to get anything out of Bea
Townley. When Lee started cautiously to put out new lines, he
employed other agents and changed them frequently. Meanwhile he
resumed his ordinary unhurried life, devoting himself to his
writing and showing himself freely in public. He cultivated the
society of Alan Talbert at this time. He did not care
particularly for that shallow young man, but Talbert was
flattered at being taken up by the noted Lee Mappin, and Lee was
thus sure that his doings would be reported in the right
places.</p>

<p>During these days Lee and Cynthia avoided private meetings.
The telephone was safer. When they had first laid their plans
Cynthia expressed a wish to take Siebert Ackroyd into the secret.
"I can't play a part with Siebert," she said.</p>

<p>Lee's face, usually so gentle to Cynthia, turned hard. "Not
with my consent," he said. "Wait until I have cleared him of all
possible suspicion."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said sadly. "Then I won't see him at
all."</p>

<p>"Just as you think best."</p>

<p>Siebert was not the man to take this tamely. After Cynthia had
put him off a couple of times, he flew into a rage and swore that
he was through. Thereafter they heard reports that he was
drinking too much and otherwise living recklessly, and that made
Cynthia sore. She tried to lose herself in her work at the
hospital and to put Siebert out of her life for good.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of Siebert, Emmett Gundy began to
constitute himself Cynthia's squire. Cynthia was a rich woman
now. Emmett aimed only to be the faithful friend, never obtruding
himself, but always at hand when wanted. His daily calls on the
phone to see how she was, his little inexpensive gifts, lapped
her in kindness. Little by little she overcame her initial
dislike of her father's classmate. They talked much of Gavin.
There was no envy in Emmett now. One day Emmett and Siebert met
accidentally in the anteroom of a publisher's office. There were
no witnesses to what happened, but Emmett suffered a black eye.
This had the result of further angering Cynthia against Siebert,
and making her kinder to Emmett.</p>

<p>Louella Kip no longer appeared at the little gatherings of
their circle, and Emmett, when questioned, said that he had not
seen her lately. Lee, becoming anxious, looked her up. He found
her absolutely without means, about to be evicted from her cheap
boarding-house, and with no place to go. She was still defiantly
loyal to Emmett and would hear no word against him. In spite of
her protests, Lee took care of her financially, and through
theatrical connections of Gavin's&mdash;not Mack
Townley&mdash;succeeded in getting her a small part in a new
play.</p>

<p>Gail Garrett continued to appear in White Orchids at the
Greenwich, but it was obvious that she had lost her grip.
Audiences are very quick to sense that sort of thing. Business
fell away with startling rapidity; the play closed, and for the
first time in many years the famous actress found herself "at
liberty." She was no longer seen around her former haunts. In
order to account for her failure, people began to say that she
was taking drugs.</p>

<p>Hillman, when he was relieved of his duties as butler,
disappeared from view. Mrs. Hillman was still doing an excellent
business at the Harvest Restaurant, and Lee, having learned that
she was in communication with her husband, let Hillman go for the
moment, satisfied that he could lay hands on him at any time.
After a week or two had passed, Hillman returned to town and took
up his duties in the restaurant. Inspector Loasby kept him under
surveillance.</p>

<p>In the course of time the police were able to produce the man
who had made the duplicate key to the garden door of the
penthouse. It was a Jewish locksmith from the lower East Side.
His description of his customer tallied with that already in the
hands of the police; a tall, heavily-built foreigner with stooped
shoulders. Wore thick glasses that caused him to peer in an odd
way, and spoke broken English. The Jew, however, insisted that he
was a Wop. Wore a leather cap that completely covered his hair,
and an old yellowish overcoat that had sagged out of shape. The
various people who had seen this man could not agree as to the
colour of his eyes. One said black, one said grey, one said blue.
This description had been put in the hands of every policeman in
New York.</p>

<p>Early, in November there was an announcement in the dramatic
columns of the New York dailies that Mack Townley had discovered
a remarkable new playwright. His name was John Venner and he had
written a play called Sin, which was so good that the astute
Townley had bought it on sight, and was preparing to put it into
rehearsal as soon as a cast could be assembled.</p>

<p>Every few days thereafter the public was fed an additional bit
of news about the new play. There was a mystery about the author.
Mack Townley had not laid eyes on him. All their business had
been conducted by correspondence. The Townley office declined to
give out his address. Though this was presumably Venner's first
play, he had had the assurance to stipulate that no changes
should be made in it, and Townley had actually agreed.</p>

<p>Very little about the play itself was given out in advance. It
was said to deal with a strange case of the transference of
personality, and, while not a horror play in the usual sense, to
have breath-taking overtones of terror and mystery. Another
account described it as an allegory in modern dress.</p>

<p>It was soon announced that the cast had been completed and
rehearsals started. The play was to open at the Townley Theatre
on Christmas night. It would have one of the most expensive casts
ever brought together. The principal woman's part would be played
by Miss Beatrice Ellerman (Mrs. Mack Townley), who had recovered
from her recent illness.</p>

<p>Lee smiled grimly as he read this last item. Bea was back in
town. The fact of her brief stay in Reno had not been published
in the Press, and nobody but Lee and his close associates knew
that the couple had separated and come together again. One
morning Lee met Bea coming out of the most fashionable beauty
salon on the Avenue. The tall Bea, in her dark slenderness and
grace, was more dazzlingly beautiful than ever. Everybody on the
sidewalk turned to look at her. She moved across, smilingly
conscious of her power. Her greeting to Lee was nicely graduated
between pleasure at the sight of an old friend and grief at the
recollection of their common loss. "Lee!" she murmured. "How good
it is to see you! Dear, dear Lee! You were his closest
friend!"</p>

<p>Lee's answering smile was a thought dry. "I'm glad to see you,
too. Your last message to me was not quite so friendly."</p>

<p>"Ah, forget it, my dear!" she said, laying a, hand on his arm.
"I was so distracted by grief at Gavin's death I didn't know what
I was doing."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Lee soothingly.</p>

<p>A shade of anxiety appeared in the handsome dark eyes. "The
fact that I went to Reno doesn't mean that there was any trouble
between Mack and me," she said. "I have a dear friend living
there and I simply wanted to be with her in my grief."</p>

<p>"I never gossip," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Why on earth did you send that person all the way to Reno to
ask me questions?"</p>

<p>"Well, there were certain suspicious circumstances in
connection with Gavin's death, but they are cleared up now."</p>

<p>"But why question me?"</p>

<p>Lee smiled his blandest smile. "My dear, you were overheard
applying very uncomplimentary epithets to your husband. In fact,
you called him...a murderer."'</p>

<p>Bea paled under her make-up and bit the deliciously painted
lip. "Lee! Who said so?"</p>

<p>"A servant."</p>

<p>"Maybe I did," she murmured. "But a woman out of her mind with
grief and hysteria&mdash;it means nothing."</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Lee.</p>

<p>He handed her into her car. Driving away, she did not look
quite so sure of herself.</p>

<p>Several nights later Lee saw Mack Townley at the annual dinner
of the Pilgrims. Mack, who had large interests in London as well
as New York, was at the speakers' table. Lee marvelled at the
transformation in him. Gone was the savage look of pain and
defeat. Mack had returned to his usual smooth and astute self;
the handsomest and the best-dressed theatrical manager of two
continents. His speech in the prevailing hands-across-the-sea
vein, was the wittiest of the evening. Mack had not written it
himself, of course, but he delivered it admirably. Lee did not
run into him until the party was breaking up. "Hello, Mack!"</p>

<p>"Well, Lee!" said Mack coolly; he was never a demonstrative
man. "How are things going?"</p>

<p>"As usual. I hear great tales about your new play."</p>

<p>Mack became the promoter at once. "In this case, Lee," he said
seriously, "the ballyhoo is not exaggerated. It is really an
extraordinary play. I have never seen actors so deeply affected
by their parts. The play inspires them."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said Lee.</p>

<p>"You shall have two tickets for the opening," said Mack,
hurrying away.</p>

<p>"Thanks, old man."</p>

<p>Day by day little advance notices designed to whet the public
appetite for the new play appeared in the dramatic columns. The
author, it appeared, had declined to take any part in rehearsals,
but it was evident that he was keeping in touch with their
progress, because he had objected to the unsuitability of Mr.
Martin Sears in the part of the country doctor, and Mr. Sears had
therefore been replaced by Mr. Everard Welcome.</p>

<p>On another day: "Mr. Basil Hoare, the celebrated young English
actor who had been brought over to play the character in John
Venner's play, Sin, who represents the spirit of evil, is so
powerful in the part that Miss Phoebe Wistar became hysterical
during a scene with him yesterday, and the rehearsal had to be
called off for the day."</p>

<p>As the date of the opening approached, the contention for
tickets became intense. Any Mack Townley opening was an event in
New York's social year, and this was considered to be
exceptional. "The greatest play I ever produced," Mack had said.
Not to be there was to confess oneself unknown. Mr. Townley's
mailing-list had to be supplied first, of course; what tickets
were available to the public were snapped up within an hour of
being put on sale. The few that fell into the hands of the
agencies were quoted at fantastic prices.</p>

<p>From the Herald-Tribune of December 20th: "Two seats for the
opening of Sin at the Townley Theatre on Christmas night were
sent to the author, the mysterious Mr. John Venner, in the usual
course. The astonishment of the management can be better imagined
than described when they were returned yesterday with a note from
Mr. Venner stating that he did not expect to attend! An author
not coming to the first night of his first play! Incredible!
However, upon thinking it over, one realises that if Mr. Venner
had occupied the numbered seats sent to him he would immediately
have been identified. No doubt he will be present, but in a place
of his own choosing."</p>

<p>Lee Mappin received his tickets in due course. He called up
Cynthia to ask her if she would go with him. "Thanks, dear," said
Cynthia, "but I haven't seen a show since, well, you know when. I
have a sort of dread of entering a theatre. Ask somebody else to
go with you."</p>

<p>"My dear, this is weak-minded," protested Lee. "The sooner you
overcome it the better. Gavin wouldn't have liked to hear you
speak like that."</p>

<p>Cynthia thought it over. "Perhaps you're right," the said.
"Very well, I'll be glad to go with you."</p>

<p>"That's better."</p>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Lee Mappin's cab came to a stop in front of
the Townley Theatre, the sidewalk was jammed from curb to wall
with a pushing throng of people, craning their necks to get a
glimpse of the arrivals. Two perspiring policemen were with
difficulty keeping a lane open for the playgoers to enter the
theatre. The gapers who were unable to get a place on the
sidewalk, ran out into the street and peered through the outer
windows of the arriving cars. As Lee and Cynthia passed through
the lane to the entrance they could hear people whispering to
each other: "Who are they? Who are they?" As neither Lee nor
Cynthia was a regular first-nighter, no reply was
forthcoming.</p>

<p>Inside the theatre they saw Emmett Gundy at a distance but he
was unable to reach their sides because of the crowd. And Alan
Talbert, beautifully arrayed, who prided himself on knowing
everybody. On the other side of the house rose the handsome head
of Siebert Ackroyd inches above the surrounding heads. He was
accompanied by a flamboyant girl who was determined to be looked
at. Cynthia looked once and not again.</p>

<p>The curtain was late, as usual. Every place in the house was
occupied except the two stage boxes. At the last moment a woman
entered the box on the left, but sat so far back behind the
curtain that they could see only her silken knees. Something in
the house below attracted her attention; she leaned forward and
they had a glimpse of Gail Garrett's drawn, white face. After the
curtain had risen, Mack Townley and several of the members of his
staff quietly entered the box on their right.</p>

<p>The play opened very quietly. The setting represented the
living-room of a somewhat dilapidated Maryland manor-house, with
tall windows open to the summer night. There was a scene between
a middle-aged man and a handsome youth, his adopted son. They
were deeply attached to each other. The boy was leaving home to
be married. Lee approved of the play from the start; an
atmosphere was created; tender, charming, yet faintly portentous.
He glanced at Cynthia to see how she was taking it, and was
surprised to find her leaning forward with parted lips, drinking
in every word. So far as he could see, nothing had happened on
the stage to account for such excitement.</p>

<p>From time to time he glanced at her. Her excitement increased.
She had lost herself completely. An intensity had come into her
gaze at the stage that was almost like pain. Her hands were
gripping the arms of her seat. Lee became very uneasy.</p>

<p>When the curtain fell on the first act there was a buzz of
comment through the house; very little applause. The
sophisticated first night audience saves that for the end. When
the lights went up Cynthia seemed to experience a slight
collapse. She went limp all over and her head dropped. She then
looked around her in a slightly shamed manner to see if her
emotion had been noticed. "Like it?" asked Lee casually.</p>

<p>"No!...Yes!...I don't know," she answered uncertainly. "But of
course I liked it!" she went on a little feverishly. "It's
wonderful! It did things to me. It frightens me a little. As
if...as if...how can I explain it? as if it was written by
somebody who knew too much about me? It was like echoes out of my
own past."</p>

<p>Lee patted her hand. He thought her language overstrained.</p>

<p>In the intermission many of the people got up to join the
crush at the back, in order to see or to be seen, but Lee and
Cynthia remained in their comfortable seats. Out of the tail of
his eye Lee saw Siebert Ackroyd striding up the aisle. Siebert
cast a savage glance at Cynthia. They had several visitors,
including the good-looking Alan Talbert who, while he was
talking, looked all around to see who was noticing him. He was
excited about the play. "A smash hit!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a little too soon to tell?" suggested Lee.</p>

<p>"No, sir! You can feel it in the air. And Mack Townley is too
wily to give them a first act that is not held up by what
follows. To-morrow morning the author will be famous."</p>

<p>"Does anybody know anything about him?" asked Cynthia
softly.</p>

<p>"No. I happen to know that that's not just press agent stuff.
Up to now he has really kept under cover. But you can depend on
it he'll appear as soon as he knows he has a hit on his
hands."</p>

<p>In the second act the tension increased as the audience
perceived the devilish net that was spread for the hapless youth.
The men were more important than the women in this play, and it
was not until the second scene of the second act that Bea
Ellerman made her appearance. She took the part of a young girl,
the youth's fiancee. Her perplexity and dismay at the subtle
change that had come over her lover were touching in the extreme.
Cynthia was breathing fast and her face had become agonised as
she watched the scene. Lee touched her arm. "My dear, it's only a
play." he whispered.</p>

<p>She turned her strained eyes on him, dark and enormous. "Can't
you hear it?" she whispered. "Hear what?"</p>

<p>"My father's voice."</p>

<p>He stared at her, too startled to speak. "This is Dad's play,
Lee."</p>

<p>"No! No!" he whispered. "It's only your fancy."</p>

<p>She obstinately shook her head. "He is speaking to me through
all the lines of the play. These are his thoughts, his feelings,
his very words! That is what moves me so!"</p>

<p>Lee, gazing in her face, half believed it. He was a logical
man, but he knew there was that in the human consciousness which
transcends logic. Pressing her hand, he whispered: "Get a grip on
yourself! Draw a mask over your face. If you are right, it is
certain that the thief who stole Gavin's play is watching us
now."</p>

<p>"I'll try," she whispered.</p>

<p>A revolving stage had been installed for the production of
Sin, and in each act the scenes succeeded each other without any
pause. In the third scene of the second act the wrecked youth,
robbed of everything that makes life worth living, crawled home
to his foster-father's house. The recognition was heart-breaking.
Cynthia's shoulders were shaking.</p>

<p>"Lee, I've got to go," she whispered. "I can't bear any
more!"</p>

<p>"But if you go the guilty one will know that we have
discovered his guilt," he protested.</p>

<p>"If I stay he will see it in my face when the lights go up. I
cannot hide it!"</p>

<p>Fearful that she might break down in the middle of a scene, he
hurried her up the aisle. As they passed through the lobby the
curtain fell on the second act and they heard the audience
forgetting its sophisticated nonchalance, break into wild
applause. "You go back," whispered Cynthia. "You might learn
something."</p>

<p>"I won't leave you," he said.</p>

<p>In the cab Cynthia broke down completely. He held her close.
"O, what a relief to get away from people," she wept. "I'm sorry
you were disappointed in me, but I couldn't stand any more!"</p>

<p>"It's no matter," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Lee," she said, "that man in the play felt towards his boy
just as my father felt towards me. My father talked to me in just
that way. Hiding his deepest feelings under a joke!"</p>

<p>"That may be a coincidence," said Lee.</p>

<p>"No! No! There are too many coincidences!...Listen! My father
lived in New York for so many years that everybody has forgotten
he was raised in Tidewater, Virginia. There were a hundred
references to Virginia. It's true they called it Maryland in the
play, but that was just a stall. The scent of the wild grape
flower in June-notice the word scent. Lee; anybody but Dad would
have said perfume&mdash;the song of the mocking-bird; the haze
that broods on the Chesapeake in summer; the trumpet flowers and
the wild blackberries in the hedges; the buzzards wheeling
against the blue!"</p>

<p>"Anybody who knew Virginia might speak of these things," said
Lee.</p>

<p>"All right. Take the peculiar sense in which he used the word
spontaneity. My father loved that quality and that word. You must
have noticed it. And the word inveigle used in place of intrigue.
Besides many others of his pet words. And his speaking of how a
good man was always at a disadvantage in the presence of a wicked
man. Can't you see his smile when he said it? Lee, if I had the
script of the play before me I believe I could point out all the
places where some clumsy hand has changed and cheapened it! Think
of the title; the right name of that play is The Changeling; Sin
is a vulgar substitution!"</p>

<p>"You need go no further," said Lee. "I am convinced."</p>

<p>"When we find John Venner," he said presently, "we will have
Gavin's murderer."</p>

<p>As Alan Talbert had foretold, the name of John Venner was
famous in New York next day. All the newspapers joined in
lavishing praises on his play. The Times said: "It is obviously
not the work of a prentice hand. The wise, humorous lines bespeak
a long experience of life, and a ripe understanding. My guess is,
that the author of Sin is a practised literary hand&mdash;perhaps
in some other field of writing, because the play reveals certain
gaucheries in dramatic technique&mdash;who has chosen the
expedient of anonymity in order to make a completely new start,
and to get an unbiased line on himself."</p>

<p>In the Herald-Tribune: "A new kind of play. The unthinking
will call it a 'horror' play, but there is no grisly monster
exhibited on the stage, no bloody head on a charger, nor
clutching hands in space. Nothing is named in the play. The
horror evoked is a silent horror of the spirit, which I need
hardly point out is much more horrible than anything which could
be produced by stage properties."</p>

<p>In the World-Telegram: "The theme is the oldest in the world;
viz., the struggle between good and evil; the battlefield being a
young man's soul. In nearly all such plays the probabilities are
violently wrenched in order to bring about a happy ending with
Virtue triumphant. The author of Sin does not beg the question.
He shows the struggle as a terrific one with odds on the side of
the Evil one, and the issue always in doubt. He rescues this
particular young man, and restores him to those who love him, but
Evil is not overcome. Evil stalks on grinning, and on the watch
for new victims."</p>

<p>In the Sun: "A completely original play; it cannot be referred
to any other play ever written. Story, characters and atmosphere;
all are new. The whole play is a succession of slight surprises;
the product of a highly individual mind. It has the inexplicable
quality of Nature itself. Like Nature, its processes are
sometimes obscure, but like Nature it works out consistently in
the end....The final scenes in their quiet way...terrific!...left
the audience gasping."</p>

<p>The success of the play in connection with the non-appearance
of the author warranted a news story in most of the papers, in
addition to the dramatic review. It was told how Mack Townley,
the producer, had sent Venner a telegram after every act, but had
received no word in reply. However, Mr. Townley was giving a
party in his apartment after the performance tomorrow night, for
the Sin company, the gentlemen of the press and his friends
generally, and he fully expected the mysterious John Venner to be
present.</p>

<p>Cynthia Dordress, busy at her desk in the hospital, was
surprised to hear the voice of Mack Townley over the wire at
noon. The great man rarely condescended to use the phone. Having
had time to gather her forces, Cynthia answered him calmly. "How
are you my dear?" asked Mack.</p>

<p>"Quite well, thanks."</p>

<p>"Somebody told me that you were forced to leave the theatre in
the middle of the show last night."</p>

<p>"Yes. Wasn't it silly of me to be taken sick at such a moment?
The worst of it was, it made Lee miss the play, too. I was all
right an hour afterwards, and I'm anxious to go again as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"How about to-morrow night?"</p>

<p>"I'd love it, if it's convenient."</p>

<p>"Surely! You'll find two seats waiting for you at the
box-office."</p>

<p>"Thanks so much. I'll try to get Lee."</p>

<p>"Afterwards perhaps you'll both come to our apartment. Bea and
I are giving a little shindig at midnight. We hope to have the
mysterious John Venner on view, but can promise nothing."</p>

<p>"How kind!" said Cynthia, "but I don't feel that I have any
business amongst all the celebrities!"</p>

<p>"What!" said Mack, "the daughter of my oldest friend who was
the greatest light of the American stage! What nonsense! Come,
and uphold the name of Dordress, my dear."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Cynthia, "and thank you."</p>

<p>She immediately called up Lee and repeated her conversation
with Mack.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Hum," said Lee. "I prefer not to say over the phone."</p>

<p>"Well, we can talk about it later."</p>

<p>"Do you really feel able to sit through the play again?"</p>

<p>"Surely. I am braced for it now. I must see this play through.
It was the shock of discovery that upset me last night."</p>

<p>"And the party afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"He won't come," said Lee.</p>

<p>"He might," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>Cynthia sat through the third performance of Sin without an
outward tremor. "It gives me pleasure now," she said to Lee.
"It's a beautiful play. It is only the changes in it that anger
me. I'd like to see it every night."</p>

<p>Lee pressed her hand. "Do you think it was Mack Townley who
stole it?" she asked coolly.</p>

<p>"I'm not prepared to say," growled Lee. "If he had, it would
have been like him to call you up yesterday. Mack plays poker.
But give me a little more time."</p>

<p>Mack and Bea Townley welcomed their guests at the door of
their big living-room. Bea, in white and gold brocade with her
diamonds and emeralds, looked queenly, but Lee, glancing from one
woman to another, considered that Cynthia's white skin and pure
profile, set off by a dull black evening gown, was the more
beautiful. Bea, pressing Cynthia's hand between both of hers,
murmured: "Darling, I'm so glad you could come. They told me you
were ill."</p>

<p>"I was better in an hour," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Do come some day when we can have a little time
together."</p>

<p>"I work in the daytime," said Cynthia, smiling; "some Sunday,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"Good! I'll give you a ring."</p>

<p>Lee listened to this with a dry expression. Both women were
lying, and each knew it.</p>

<p>Mack's handsome hard face wore its customary mask of scornful
good humour. His courtesy was perfect.</p>

<p>The living-room was sixty feet long, and with the library at
one end and a great dining-room opening at the side, the suite
could accommodate two hundred people without crowding. Pink roses
were banked between the windows. All the luminaries of New York
professional and cafe society were present; millionaires,
actresses, divorcees, play-boys and titles. The most popular
persons present were the social commentators and press
photographers, who were hailed with cries of welcome as they
circulated with note-book and camera. "Such is modern society,"
grumbled Lee.</p>

<p>Everybody was eating lobster salad and drinking champagne.
Each plate had a little rack affixed to the rim to hold a glass,
so that two-handed creatures could accomplish this feat while
standing. Waiters threaded their way through the throng, filling
the glasses as fast as they were emptied. A deafening clatter of
conversation filled the rooms.</p>

<p>As Cynthia and Lee slowly made their way through, they met
many acquaintances. Gail Garrett appeared to be the only member
of Gavin Dordress' old circle who was not present. Emmett Gundy
attached himself to them. Emmett did not appear to advantage in
the brightly-lighted room. The thinning hair on his crown was
painfully apparent, his face was sourer and more pinched than
usual. He said to Cynthia: "Disgusting mob! I'm surprised that
you cared to come."</p>

<p>"O, once in a while it's amusing," she answered.</p>

<p>Alan Talbert came up to them, pale and glassy-eyed with
excitement. "Glorious occasion!" he said. "Drink with me. I'm on
the threshold of a new life!"</p>

<p>At the moment his words didn't seem to make sense. "It's the
champagne," muttered Emmett as they passed on.</p>

<p>They came face to face with Siebert Ackroyd in the dining-room
doorway. Emmett paled and edged aside. Siebert, ignoring both
Emmett and Lee, fixed his eyes on Cynthia with an expression both
savage and full of pain. "You look handsome," he said to her.</p>

<p>"Same to you," said Cynthia, coolly meeting his glance.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you coming out of your shell," said Siebert,
"but I don't like your company."</p>

<p>"I do," said Cynthia, smiling and moving on.</p>

<p>"Damned impudence!" muttered Lee.</p>

<p>Later, Lee and Cynthia were standing against the wall of the
big room watching the tail-coated men and the bejewelled women
weaving and clustering in front of them. The noise had grown
louder; one had to shout to make oneself heard. The free
champagne had been downed too quickly, and many of the faces
seemed to have softened like butter in a warm room. Cynthia said
in Lee's ear: "I wish we lived in the country."</p>

<p>"I get you, my dear."</p>

<p>There had been no new arrivals for some time, and Mack Townley
was now circulating through the room pausing to say the right
word to everybody. He said to Lee: "I'm looking around for an
unexplained person who might be the playwright. But I seem to
know everybody here."</p>

<p>Lee said when Mack had passed on: "If he's bluffing, it's well
done!"</p>

<p>Mack finally climbed on a chair at the end of the room and
clapped his hands to command attention. "Friends, Romans,
Countrymen," he said smilingly, "I am sorry to say that I cannot
produce my playwright. What has happened to him I don't know. I
am unable to picture an author who could pass up such an
opportunity to receive the homage of the cream of New York. It
may be that..."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Mack!" cried a voice below him. "He's
here!"</p>

<p>An excited murmur passed through the crowd. Everybody craned
their necks. They saw Alan Talbert pushing up to Mack's chair.
"In me you see John Venner," he cried, striking a mock attitude.
'There was an astonished silence, followed by a burst of
applause. Everybody pushed up towards the chair, leaving Lee and
Cynthia on the outskirts of the crowd. Mack looked a little taken
aback, but he smiled still. He stepped down from the chair, and
Talbert, without waiting to be asked, climbed upon it, and turned
his white face and punch-drunk eyes on the crowd. "I am the
author of Sin, God forgive me," he announced. "I wrote it on my
little Corona!"</p>

<p>There was a tremendous burst of handclapping in which Mack
Townley, always the diplomatist, joined. On the outskirts of the
crowd Cynthia's eyes fired up dangerously, and Lee could almost
see the words shaping on her lips: "You lie!" He pressed her
hand. "Quiet!" he whispered. "This is not the place."</p>

<p>Cynthia relaxed. "I got tired of rushing my plays around to
the managers' offices and having them fired back at me with
insincere praises," Talbert was saying. "You all know what people
say about me; 'Alan Talbert? Sure! Nice lad, but he can't write
for a damn!' That was my label. When you get a label it's useless
to struggle. So when a real bang-up, number one idea for a play
came to me I said nothing about it. And when it was finished I
invented this John Venner in order to get a fresh hearing. And as
it has turned out I seem to have been justified..."</p>

<p>More applause.</p>

<p>"Lee, that is the man!" murmured Cynthia.</p>

<p>"I am not convinced of it," said Lee.</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise. "He could have done it. Lee. He
was a frequent visitor at Dad's place. He is tall enough to have
worn the yellow overcoat. He had plenty of opportunities to steal
the key to the garden door and have a duplicate made."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Lee. "But think it over. If he had stolen the
play he would have been watching you last night. When he saw you
leave the theatre he would have known you suspected something. He
would never have had the courage to stand up and claim the play
to your face to-night."</p>

<p>"But he has claimed it."</p>

<p>"There is a possibility that when the author failed to turn up
to-night, Talbert figured that he never would acknowledge his
play. So Talbert may have decided to claim the credit. Even
though the deception is quickly discovered, Talbert will have had
his day in the news."</p>

<p>"Let's get out of this," whispered Cynthia.</p>

<p>As they were making their way through the foyer, they saw
Mack, suave, smiling, never at a loss, dealing with a knot of
reporters.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in this claim of Alan Talbert's?" one asked
him bluntly.</p>

<p>"Certainly I believe in it," said Mack. "Talbert is a friend
of mine."</p>

<p>"Has his work in the past shown the promise that would justify
you in thinking he wrote Sin?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I haven't read his other plays."</p>

<p>"Won't you require him to present documentary proof of the
authorship of Sin?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mack with an air of surprise. "Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's the question of paying the royalties."</p>

<p>"That doesn't concern me," said Mack. "The play was sent me by
an agent. I pay the royalties to the agent. It's up to him to
decide who they belong to."</p>

<p>"Who is the agent?"</p>

<p>"Siebert Ackroyd. He's here somewhere."</p>

<p>Cynthia's grasp of Lee's arm tightened painfully.</p>

<p>"O, let's get away!" she whispered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20">CHAPTER XX.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">THE story of what happened at Mack Townley's
party broke too late to make the morning papers. Lee had to wait
for the first afternoon editions which come out in the middle of
the morning. In addition to what Mack had told the reporters,
Alan Talbert had given out a flamboyant interview in which he
described how he had written Sin and Siebert Ackroyd, talking
more cautiously, told how the play had come to him by mail with a
covering letter. He had had a number of letters from the author
since, but had never laid eyes on the man. He had transmitted the
advance payment by post office money order, according to the
author's instructions. He refused to give the author's address.
As to Alan Talbert, Siebert said that he saw no reason to
question his claim, but that of course as a business man, he must
await legal proof before paying him any royalties.</p>

<p>Subsequent editions of the papers described how busily Mr.
Alan Talbert was making hay while the sun shone. He displayed no
reluctance to talk to the press. Before the day was out he had
sold options on two of his earlier plays to other New York
producers, and had banked the advance payments. These producers
stipulated that the plays must be billed with the name of John
Venner as author, to which Talbert had cheerfully agreed. Talbert
had signed a contract to go to Hollywood later at a handsome
salary, and in the meantime had accepted a radio engagement. The
Hollywood producers were bidding against each other for the
rights of Sin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from early morning, Lee, leaving Siebert Ackroyd
aside for the moment, had been checking up on his office force.
Siebert employed five persons; a secretary, a woman assistant, a
male office manager, a second stenographer and a messenger to
tote manuscripts around. Lee, from amongst his wide connections,
chose operatives here and there and assigned one to make contact
with each of the Ackroyd employees. It was the stenographer who
proved to be the weak sister. She fell hard for the lively and
attractive young man who was put on her trail, and by one o'clock
on Friday morning (the Townley party was on Wednesday night) Lee
was in possession of all the gossip of the Ackroyd office
concerning their mysterious client, John Venner. The story was as
follows:</p>

<p>The original script of Sin as received by Siebert Ackroyd had
been typed on an old machine with a worn ribbon. This had
occasioned a good deal of ill temper in those who read it,
because of the eye-strain involved. It contained many
typographical errors which had been laboriously corrected on the
machine. Thus the author's handwriting appeared nowhere in the
script. The arrangement of speeches, business, etc., indicated
that the author was not familiar with the customary way of
preparing a playscript. The agency's first act was to have some
fair copies typed. The original script was filed. The letter
which accompanied the script had been typed on the same machine,
but it was signed by hand with a scrawly and imperfectly formed
signature which looked as if it might be that of a very old man.
Subsequent letters were all signed in the same way. For an
address they gave a post-office box in Newark, New Jersey.</p>

<p>The latest letter from "John Venner" had been received on
Wednesday. This one bore no address at the top. The writer
implied that he had seen the first performance of Sin the
previous night, but showed no pleasure at its success. He was
writing, he said, to inform his agent that he was "travelling,"
and to instruct him to hold all communications, remittances,
etc., until further notice. Obviously he had not travelled far,
because the envelope bore the postmark of Stamford, Connecticut,
which is only thirty miles from New York. He enclosed a power of
attorney to enable Siebert Ackroyd to act for him in all
ways.</p>

<p>Lee immediately had a watch put on the Newark post office box,
but it was never visited again. Siebert Ackroyd's last letter to
his client lay in it unclaimed. Clearly, John Venner had taken
alarm.</p>

<p>The Ackroyd office received another letter from him on Friday,
angrily repudiating Alan Talbert's claim to the play. Venner
undertook to prove that he had written the original script by
describing the errors and corrections on a certain page. He
suggested that Siebert should invite Alan Talbert to submit to a
similar test. Venner said that he had a carbon copy of the script
in his possession which he would produce "at the proper
time."</p>

<p>Siebert sent copies of this letter to the press and it was
printed in the afternoon editions. Thus, after twenty-four hours
of sunshine, young Mr. Talbert went into eclipse. But not
altogether. He had made the headlines; his name had become news.
Once a name is news New Yorkers are prone to forget how it first
got that way.</p>

<p>On Friday night after dinner, Lee, Cynthia and Fanny Parran
were discussing these things in Lee's apartment. Cynthia's eyes
were dark with pain. She said with extreme bitterness: "It was
Siebert. That is clear."</p>

<p>"Nothing is proved," said Lee.</p>

<p>Cynthia shook her head impatiently. "Don't try to soften the
blow. I've got to take it. It was Siebert. The power of attorney
proves it. John Venner will never be heard of again. Siebert will
collect the royalties under his power of attorney. I will never
believe in anybody again."</p>

<p>"It might just as well have been Mack Townley," insisted Lee.
"Venner's stipulation that the play must first be offered to
Townley suggests that."</p>

<p>"Mack is a business man," said Cynthia. "You know he wouldn't
hand over a fortune in royalties and movie rights just for a
gesture."</p>

<p>"He might think that it was worth it for the sake of diverting
suspicion from himself."</p>

<p>Cynthia shook her head again. "What's the next move?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I will have them put under surveillance," said Lee. "I will
have a look at Venner's letters and at the original script."</p>

<p>"How will you go about that?"</p>

<p>He smiled at her.</p>

<p>Cynthia was still in his apartment when there was a ring at
the door and a package was handed in. Lee brought it into the
living-room and opened it. It contained the original script of
Sin, and all Venner's letters to Siebert Ackroyd. "How did you
get them?" demanded Cynthia, opening her eyes to their
widest.</p>

<p>"A little act of burglary," said Lee blandly. "I have arranged
for photostat copies to be made, and they will be back in the
Ackroyd files before morning."</p>

<p>Cynthia regarded the untidy script with sombre eyes. "My
father's murderer filled those pages," she murmured.</p>

<p>Lee handed it first to Fanny, who was an expert in typing. She
studied it word by word under a magnifying glass, while Lee with
another glass spread the dozen letters on the table. He gave
attention first to the signature. After making some experiments
with a pen held in his left hand, he said: "These letters appear
to have been signed by a man writing with his left hand. All the
signatures show the same characteristics but the letters are
better formed towards the last. He has been practising writing
with his left hand."</p>

<p>"As to the letters," said Lee, "they are all brief and they
are expressed in a rather dictatorial or peremptory style. He
issues his orders as if his agent were a servant," Lee looked at
Cynthia affectionately. "My dear, a man would hardly take that
tone if he were writing to himself."</p>

<p>Cynthia refused to be impressed. "If he was clever enough to
have thought of the rest, he could assume that, too."</p>

<p>Fanny said: "He used a Royal typewriter of an old model. The
type is badly worn, the alignment of letters has become uneven
through neglect, and the rubber platen so hardened with age that
the period made a hole in the paper every time it was
struck."</p>

<p>"Good work!" said Lee.</p>

<p>After further study of the script. Fanny went on: "The person
who wrote this was accustomed to typing. He wrote rapidly, but he
keeps making the same mistakes all through. It looks as if he had
been accustomed to a different keyboard, but that can hardly be,
since all makes of typewriters adopted a standardised keyboard
some years ago. I can't explain it."</p>

<p>"I can't see the great Mack Townley typing rapidly," said
Cynthia.</p>

<p>"He wasn't always great." said Lee. "He used a typewriter in
college."</p>

<p>"Here's a funny thing!" exclaimed Fanny. "Though the type
generally is so worn, there is one character that is clear and
sharp. It's the exclamation point." She shoved the script over
for Lee to see.</p>

<p>"Fine!" said Lee. "That is something definite to go on. The
exclamation point is not included in the standard keyboard. The
man who used the old typewriter had it put in place of some
character he didn't use. He required exclamation points on every
page of his play, you see. He would naturally go to one of the
Royal service shops to have this done. Such a request cannot be a
common one. Perhaps we can trace the old typewriter through this
means."</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:center" class="typewriter">REPORTS OF
A.W.</p>

<p><br> ("This is a new man I have got," remarked Lee to Cynthia;
"An actor temporarily out of a job. He's good.")</p>

<p class="typewriter">December 20th. As soon as I received word
from you that Mrs. Mack Townley had applied to the &mdash;&mdash;
Agency for an English butler, I went to the Agency to register.
The woman in charge merely glanced at my fake English
testimonials. My appearance and my answers to her questions were
more important to her. Of course, I have never been a butler
except on the stage, but I had prepared myself for this interview
by studying a butler's manual, and I passed muster all right.
When she asked for a New York reference I gave her General
Harrington's name, according to your instructions.</p>

<p class="typewriter">I was sent first to a Mrs. Frelinghuysen on
Fifth Avenue, and I had considerable difficulty in getting away,
because she wanted to engage me. I said I was addicted to snuff,
and she let me go. This interview gave me more assurance in
facing Mrs. Townley, to whom I was next sent. Mrs. T. is a very
beautiful woman but she is not a lady born, and she has an
arrogant and disagreeable manner towards servants. However, that
was nothing to me. I made the right answers and was instructed to
come to work yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p class="typewriter">On my arrival at the apartment I was turned
over to the other servants. Mrs. Townley prefers male help;
besides myself there is a cook, a houseman and Mr. Townley's
valet. The only female servant is Mrs Townley's maid, an
attractive young-woman called Antoinette, of French nationality.
All the servants dislike their masters and gossip about them
freely. Mrs. T., I was told, is unreasonable and overbearing
while her husband is subject to violent rages. More than once he
has had to settle handsomely after beating up a servant. Although
they pay the best wages, none of their present servants has been
with them longer than six weeks except Adolph Braun, Mr. T.'s
valet. I tried to ingratiate myself with Braun, but he's a surly
man, the only one of the lot who is not inclined to
talkativeness.</p>

<p class="typewriter">There was a lot of gossip among the
servants about the play Sin, but of course they don't know
anything-except, perhaps, Antoinette, who accompanies her
mistress to the theatre every night. Antoinette said very
mysteriously that Townley knows who really wrote the play, and so
does Mrs. T., and that she is holding the knowledge over his
head. However, they expect to make a quarter of a million out of
it, and neither is going to say or do anything which will
jeopardise that.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Mr. Townley came home about six and gave me
a sharp look when I took his things. That's just his way. He has
no reason to believe that I am anything but what I appear to be.
He went direct to his wife, who was in her boudoir, and
Antoinette, who was with her, told me afterwards that his first
words were that the movie rights of Sin had been sold to
Paramount for a hundred thousand. "How much of that do you get?"
Mrs. T asked. "Twenty-five thousand," he said. "Damn!" said Mrs.
T. "It goes hard to have to hand over three-quarters of it!"</p>

<p class="typewriter">Dinner passed off without any bad breaks on
my part. Mrs. Townley called me down sharply for some little
things, and I begged her to excuse me because of nervousness at
the first meal. From the pantry I heard her husband say that I
looked promising, and she oughtn't to be so hard on me or they'd
get worse. She was very agreeable to her husband through the
meal. Antoinette says that means she is deceiving him. Her latest
flame is Mr. Basil Hoare, the handsome Englishman who plays
opposite her in Sin. Townley suspects nothing as yet.</p>

<p class="typewriter">The conversation of husband and wife
throughout the meal was mostly about the play, the actors and the
way they played their parts. Mrs. Townley complained bitterly
about the actress who is her mother in the play, saying that she
hogged every scene in which she appeared. Mr. Townley tried to
smooth her down by saying that he could see that, but that it
would be foolish to get rid of the woman so soon after the
reviewers had given her such good notices. "Just wait a while, my
dear," he said.</p>

<p class="typewriter">She asked him if there was anything new in
respect to the so-called John Venner. He said no, he thought they
would hear no more about him. She said she hoped so for his sake,
in such a funny tone that he immediately asked her what she meant
by it. Her face was all innocence immediately. She said:
"Nothing, dear, only it would be just too bad if the performances
were halted on account of legal proceedings over the
authorship."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Nobody is going to close the play when
it's grossing twenty-five thousand a week," he growled.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Shortly after eight o'clock Mr and Mrs. T.
departed for the theatre taking Antoinette with them, and I saw
no more of them last night. Mrs. T. sent Antoinette home after
the performance and she herself didn't come in until near four.
Her husband was waiting for her, and there was a scene. There
were no witnesses to it so I cannot give you any details.</p>

<p class="typewriter">December 21st (Sunday). Neither of them
showed themselves yesterday until lunch. They appeared to be
reconciled. Mr. Townley is crazy about his wife, and she can do
pretty much what she likes with him. I am sorry that I can't add
much to my report of yesterday. Mr and Mrs. Townley are
accustomed to be spied on by unfriendly servants and they have
learned to keep a guard on their tongues when any of us are
within hearing. Antoinette is my best source of information, but
she only knows what she can pick up. There's a kind of armed
truce between her and her mistress. Antoinette has made herself
indispensable to Mrs. T., but the latter doesn't confide in her
maid.</p>

<p class="typewriter">At the lunch table whenever Mrs. T had
anything interesting to say to Mr. T she would say to me: "That
will be all, Whiteley; if we require anything I'll ring." And I
would have to beat it into the pantry. I might have heard
something by listening at the door, but the houseman was in and
out and I was afraid of arousing suspicion. In this household
it's every man for himself. The servants hate their master and
mistress, but they would betray me to them in a minute if they
thought there was anything in it for themselves.</p>

<p class="typewriter">After lunch they both went out. Mrs.
Townley had to go to the theatre for the matinee, and Townley
told her he was meeting Siebert Ackroyd at the Conradi-Windermere
for the purpose of signing the movie contracts with the Paramount
officials.</p>

<p class="typewriter">At dinner last night the following
conversation took place between them. I don't understand it, but
pass it along for what it may be worth. Townley said: "I am
considering a play by Jules Taschereau as a vehicle for you later
on." She said: "Hadn't you better let me read it before you make
up your mind?" He said: "Surely! It isn't a good play but it will
make money. The woman's part is the whole thing. Your part in Sin
isn't worthy of you. Now that you have created it, you could
retire and do this other thing." Mrs. Townley, leaning her chin
on her palm, said with a dreamy air: "Of course, it's not much of
a part, but I love it! I hear his dear voice in every line!"
Townley flew into a passion and pounded the table. "Am I to have
him thrown in my face forever!" She looked at him contemptuously
and said: "Are you jealous of the dead?" Then she saw me and
dismissed me from the room. A.W.</p>

<p><br> When Cynthia read this report her ideas underwent a
violent process of readjustment.</p>

<p>"Mack Townley?" she muttered. Then in a different tone.</p>

<p>"Mack Townley! It was he!" Lee shrugged deprecatingly. "But it
is clear from this that both Mack Townley and his wife know that
Sin is my father's play."</p>

<p>"Surely. However, that doesn't prove that Mack killed him. You
must remember that Gavin and Mack were associated for nearly
twenty years in putting on plays. It is possible that when this
play was offered to Mack he recognised it as Gavin's work from
internal evidence, just as you did."</p>

<p>"And never denounced the murderer and thief!"</p>

<p>"My dear," said Lee, "Mack's trained eye would tell him at a
glance that there was a fortune in the play, whoever wrote
it."</p>

<p>"Ah, human nature is disgusting!" exclaimed Cynthia in her
bitterness.</p>

<p>"O, not always!" protested Lee.</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:center" class="typewriter">BRIEFER REPORTS
FROM DETECTIVE-SERGEANT J.</p>

<p class="typewriter">It's a cinch to watch George Hillman
because his life is so regular. The danger of this job is, it's
too easy; I find myself falling asleep over it. Since he returned
to town he has been sticking closely to business at the Harvest
Restaurant. A couple of weeks ago they decided to keep it open
all night and as there is no other all-night eating place in the
neighbourhood, the move has been very profitable. I should
estimate that they were grossing well over two thousand a week
now. Hillman don't seem to take any pleasure in their prosperity.
He's as worried looking as ever.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Mrs. Hillman is at the desk from nine in
the morning until nine at night, and her husband takes it from
nine pm until nine am. He goes straight home and goes to bed,
getting up at five or five-thirty in the afternoon. The next four
hours are his own, but on many days he doesn't come out of the
house until it is time to go to the restaurant. He gets all his
meals in his own restaurant. Sometimes he does a little shopping
in Tremont Avenue, or just mooches up and down the street without
any particular purpose. Whenever he's out he always drops into
some saloon, not to drink, but to play the slot machines. He
appears to have no friends. I have never seen him speak to
anybody.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Yesterday he departed from this routine.
Coming out of his house about six o'clock he proceeded to the
East Side subway and took a down-town express. At 86th he changed
to a local and got out at Fifty-first Street. I followed him to
the Conradi-Winder-mere Hotel and was just behind him when he
asked at the desk for Miss Gail Garrett. The clerk told him that
Miss Garrett no longer lived there, and that they didn't have her
present address. He referred Hillman to Mr. Bittner, her manager.
Hillman then entered a telephone booth. The adjoining booths were
full and I was unable to overhear the conversation, but I assumed
that he was calling Bittner's apartment. He then took a Lexington
Avenue bus to Twenty-fifth Street and entered an old hotel called
the Engstrom, a crummy joint, badly run down. I was just behind
him. He asked for Miss Garrett and after telephoning upstairs,
they told him she was out. But I could tell (and so could he)
that the telephone girl had had her on the wire.</p>

<p class="typewriter">I made some fake inquiry of the clerk and
followed Hillman out of the hotel. He looked sunk. For over an
hour he wandered aimlessly along the streets of that
neighbourhood; Lexington Avenue, Twenty-eighth Street, Fifth
Avenue, Twenty-third and so on. At ten past eight he returned to
the Engstrom. I couldn't follow him in a second time because the
clerk would certainly have got on to me. Anyhow, he was turned
away a second time and came out looking depressed. It was now
time to go to work, and he took the subway back to the Bronx.</p>
<br>

<p style="text-align:center" class="typewriter">FROM M. O'B.</p>

<p class="typewriter">I went to the office of the &mdash;&mdash;
Co publishers to fish for a little information. The man who
received me said they were no longer publishers for Emmett Gundy.
"O, has he left you?" I said. "Hardly that," the man said with a
sour smile, "his last novel was not profitable and we didn't care
to go on with him. You had better go to Miss Flora Chisholm, his
agent, for further information." Miss Chisholm's office is on the
seventh floor of the New York Central Building. Here I made out
to be the representative of a new publishing house. I asked her
if she had placed Mr. Gundy's last novel. No, she had not, but
several publishers were interested in it. She gave me a sales
talk, and offered to send the script to my office. "You can have
this fine novel on very easy terms," she said. I told her not to
send it until I let her know.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Thus it appears that Gundy is still up
against it, but as far as I can see he isn't working at anything.
On December 6th he moved from the cheap room on East Thirty-fourth
Street where he has lived for six months past, and took a
room at the Hotel Vandermeer. It was a small room but it must
have set him back $3.50 a day. On December 27th he left the
Vandermeer and took another cheap room on East Nineteenth Street.
As far as I could see he didn't do anything while at the
Vandermeer but pose in the lobby.</p>

<p class="typewriter">He is hard up but not entirely without
money. Acts like a man whose time hangs heavy on his hands. About
noon I see him come to his window in his pyjamas, yawning and
stretching. When he comes out of the house he always looks the
pink of perfection. On the night of the 28th he attended a party
given by Mack Townley at the Andorra. He spends a lot of time in
the cheap movie houses on West Forty-second Street. On the 30th
he spent the entire afternoon and evening going from one house to
another. On the morning of the 27th I trailed him to the office
of his agent, Miss Chisholm, in the New York Central Building. I
couldn't wait in the up-stairs corridor for him to come out
because it was empty. So I stood in the main lobby downstairs
watching the elevators. All the elevators serving the seventh
floor came down in the same alcove, and I didn't see how he could
get by me. But he never came down. After waiting a couple of
hours I put in a fake call to Miss Chisholm's office. She said he
had been there but had left immediately. On the 28th the same
thing happened again. This was the afternoon. He went to his
agent's office and never came down again. I waited until I saw
Miss Chisholm and her stenographer going home and then I knew the
office was closed. M. O'B.</p>

<p><br> "This man is a fool," remarked Lee. "It has not occurred
to him that if Emmett discovered he was being trailed all he had
to do was to walk upstairs and take an elevator that would land
him in a different part of the lobby. I must find a better
man."</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:center" class="typewriter">FROM V. P.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Alan Talbert has a front of brass. In spite
of everything that has been published in the newspapers, he is
still going around asserting with a smooth face that he wrote
Sin, and no amount of razzing can break him down. He can find
plenty who pretend to believe him; to a certain class of people
he's a hero because he has had so much publicity. He has no
difficulty in finding some rich woman (not too young) to take him
on a round of the most expensive hot spots every night.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Amongst all this chatter I heard Alan say
one thing that may or may not be of interest to you. It was at
the bar of the Colony Restaurant. An over-stuffed dame
upholstered in sables was feeding Alan there and they had lined
up for a quick one before going in. Next to Alan stood Rufus
Cooley, the critic, who said, laughing: "You will never make me
believe that you wrote it! Sin was turned out by a more finished
hand than yours, my boy!"</p>

<p class="typewriter">That is Gavin Dordress' influence," said
Alan. "You forget that I worked under Gavin for years. He used to
call me his successor. He helped me a lot with this play. The
quiet effectiveness of the big scenes that you have all spoken of
is due to Gavin. I owe Gavin everything."</p>

<p class="typewriter">Rufus actually seemed impressed by this.
"Gavin Dordress!" he said, stroking his chin. "I never thought of
that!...Dordress? Why, of course! Of course!" V. P.</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:center" class="typewriter">REPORT OF E. B.
H.</p>

<p class="typewriter">DECEMBER 31st. I didn't report earlier
because I was unable to establish contact with my man. Siebert
Ackroyd lives at the Madison along with many another well-to-do
young man about town. I thought my best line would be that of the
rich young idler and I went to the Madison on Friday morning and
took a suite. Ackroyd has lived there for several years and is
well known to the staff. The servants talk about him because he
has been so much in the news lately. They say that a change has
come over him. One of the most popular young fellows in that set,
he has turned solitary and morose. In view of the great success
of his play Sin nobody can understand it. They say that he stood
to pull down a commission of ten grand from the movie rights
alone. They say he is drinking too much, and they resent it
because he doesn't do his drinking at the Madison.</p>

<p class="typewriter">I found it was a tough assignment to track
Ackroyd because he takes a taxi every time he steps out the door.
It is almost impossible to trail a man through the streets of New
York in a car because of the traffic chances. I lost him every
time I tried it, so I can't tell you what his movements were
during the day on Friday or Saturday.</p>

<p class="typewriter">However, after dinner on Friday night he
started out from his hotel on foot, and I after him. He led me to
a saloon on Third Avenue. He stood down at the end of the bar
away from everybody and ordered a straight rye. I could see by
the ugly look in his eyes that it would be foolish to speak to
him. He would only have cussed me out, and I would have been no
further good on this assignment. So I stood at the bar near him
(but not too near) making out that I was a solitary drinker with
a grouch, just like himself, and hoping he would notice me. But
he did not. He remained there a couple of hours ordering one
whisky after another without any visible effect, and saying
nothing. He then went home and presumably to bed.</p>

<p class="typewriter">On Saturday evening he didn't show up at
the hotel for dinner. I looked in at the Third Avenue saloon just
on the chance, and there he was in the same place scowling at his
drink. So I ordered one and stood there scowling at mine
likewise, making out not to notice him at all. This night I was
in luck because there was three young roughs in the place who
were pretty tight. They passed some remarks about Ackroyd because
they didn't like his high-toned style, but he didn't hear them.
Afterwards the three were scuffling in the back of the room and
one of them bumped against Ackroyd. He was just drunk enough and
sore enough to turn and cuss the fellow out, and all three of
them were ready to mix it up with him then.</p>

<p class="typewriter">That was my chance. I lined up alongside
Ackroyd, saying I would see fair play, and between us we
stretched all three of them. We and the bartender then threw them
into the street. "Let's go over to the Madison," he said; "I live
there."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"So do I," I said. "We won't go into the
Madison bar," he said. "I know too many of those guys. I'm fed up
with them. We'll go up in my room and order a bottle."</p>

<p class="typewriter">That suited me all right. But even up in
his room with a bottle of Canadian Club between us, he had little
to say. He apologised for being such poor company, and I said:
"That's all right with me. I don't feel like talking myself."
That caught his attention and he said: "So you're feeling low,
too, eh? What is it? Woman trouble?" I nodded, and he thrust out
his hand. "Put it there, fellow!" He filled up my glass and his
own. "After all, whisky's a fellow's best friend," he said.</p>

<p class="typewriter">I started to tell him the story I had made
up about my girl's shipping me. He listened with attention. When
I came to the end he burst out: "All these good women are alike:
they must have their pound of flesh, like Shylock. The men who
treat women as mere playthings to be picked up and dropped again
when you're through with them are right! Love 'em and leave 'em,
that's going to be my motto hereafter, Once a woman gets under
your skin you're a goner; she'll crucify you!"</p>

<p class="typewriter">From that he went on to tell me a little
about his own affair, but only in general terms, no particulars.
"I had a girl," he said, "and I went all out for her. God I how I
loved her! I was prepared to lie, to steal, to kill for that
woman, and she, O, she was the perfect lady throughout. All this
money that's rolling in on me I aimed to spend on her. It's only
a mockery now."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Maybe she might change her mind now," I
suggested. "No, she has plenty of her own," he said. "She isn't
mercenary. Only too goddamned ladylike! She turned me down
because I was too wicked and violent for her taste. She wants a
tame man."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Did she have any special reason?" I asked.
"O, I've done things I wouldn't want her to know about," he said,
"but she could have made anything she wanted of me! The hell with
her! She had ice in her veins!"</p>

<p><br> When she had read this far, Cynthia broke down in stormy
weeping.</p>

<p>"This is intolerable!" she cried. "It's so wicked and untrue!
O, I hate him for it! I hate him!"</p>

<p>Lee reached for the report.</p>

<p>"Why read any further?"</p>

<p>Cynthia clung to it. "I want to know the worst about him." She
read on:</p> <br>

<p class="typewriter">"There was always trouble between this girl
and me," Ackroyd continued. "I loved her too goddamned much, that
was the reason. She couldn't understand it. She didn't know that
if she had given me love it would have softened me like a magic
charm. There was a certain obstacle in the way that drove me
savage."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"What kind of obstacle?" I asked. "Never
mind," he said. "It was there. Then it was unexpectedly removed
and I thought everything would be all right between us. But no!
She backed and she filled; she blew hot and cold. Finally she
made up her mind that I was a crook and that was the end."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Were you a crook?" I asked with a
grin.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Sure," he said, "aren't we all?"</p>

<p class="typewriter">"What particular kind of crookedness was it
that she jibbed at?" I asked. The innocent-sounding question
aroused his suspicions.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"O, everything," he said, and shut up like
a clam. For a while I talked about other things to smooth him
down, and then I beat it.&lt;/&gt;</p>

<p class="typewriter">E. B. H.</p>

<p><br> "This is worse than I had expected," murmured Cynthia.
"There is a phrase here: 'I aimed to spend this money on her.'
That proves that Siebert had been planning the crime for
weeks."</p>

<p>"It is possible," said Lee.</p>

<p>"You were right about Mack Townley," she went on. "He didn't
do it. What Siebert said to this man is as good as a
confession."</p>

<p>"I have expressed no opinion either one way or the other,"
said Lee. "Let us keep open minds."</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:center" class="typewriter">REPORT OF R. F.
S.</p>

<p class="typewriter">The Royal Typewriter Company has two
service shops in New York. I visited both of them without result.
No employee could remember having received an order to add an
exclamation point to the keyboard of an old Royal machine. Other
Royal shops in the New York district are in Brooklyn and Newark,
N.J. In Newark I finally struck pay dirt. The machinist in charge
of repairs remembered the man who wanted an exclamation point,
though it was about two months ago, he said, when this customer
came in. It was fixed in the machinist's mind because the order
was an unusual one, and because the customer was such a
queer-looking guy.</p>

<p class="typewriter">His description of the man tallies with
other descriptions of the man in the yellow overcoat. The
machinist said he brought the typewriter in under his arm, and
carried it out again when it was fixed. It was in bad order and
the machinist tried to get an order to repair it, or to sell the
customer a better machine. But he had no money, he said; all he
wanted was an exclamation point, "because he had to write
dialogue." The machinist tried to get in talk with him but he
only gave curt answers.</p>

<p class="typewriter">The customer's actions were so mysterious
the machinist thought maybe the typewriter was stolen, and he
checked it with the list of stolen machines that is furnished to
all branch offices. But the number wasn't on the list. The serial
number of the machine was 117284. It was of the model that was
put out in 1923 and had had hard usage. Scratched in the paint on
the under side of the frame were the words "Reliable O.S. Co."
The machinist said he thought his customer was from New York,
because he came and went in the direction of the tube
station.</p>

<p class="typewriter">The New York telephone directory furnished
the name of a Reliable Office Supply Company on Sixth Avenue and
I went up there on the chance. I was in luck. This is the store
where the man in the yellow overcoat bought the typewriter; the
date was November 8th.</p>

<p><br> ("Two days after Gavin was killed," remarked Lee.)</p>

<p class="typewriter">The store, which is near the corner of
Forty-ninth Street, sells all makes of second-hand typewriters.
The salesman remembered this customer because of his queer
appearance, and because when he tried the machine in the store,
though he could write fairly fast, he used only his two
forefingers in striking the keys. When a remark was made about
this he said he had taught himself to type. He paid fifteen
dollars for the old machine. The salesman offered to let him have
a boy to carry it home, but he said he didn't mind carrying it
himself; he didn't have far to go. A few minutes later he
returned and bought a box of typewriter paper and a dozen sheets
of carbon. This suggests that he had established himself
somewhere near by.</p>

<p class="typewriter">I made inquiries in Forty-ninth Street. I
got no line on his hangout, if any, but I found where he had left
an old pair of shoes to be patched at a repair shop in that
street. This was a week ago. I ought to have assistance in
watching the shop in case he comes for the shoes. It is open from
eight in the morning until eleven o'clock at night.</p>

<h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">AT the hospital Cynthia served as aide to the
doctors of the neurological clinic. Her job was to receive the
out-patients, to enter their names, to arrange for their
appointments with the doctors, and to keep up their case
histories. Hundreds of cases passed through her hands weekly, but
they were still individual to her and human. Some of the warped
brains were very difficult to deal with; stubborn, suspicious,
full of fear and hatred of the world where they found themselves
at such a disadvantage. Cynthia laid it on herself to treat such
cases with a special patience.</p>

<p>The clinic was open in the afternoons only. As there was no
regular provision for social service in the hospital, Cynthia had
volunteered for the work which was especially necessary in
connection with her department. Most of her mornings were spent
in visiting the homes of the patients, to find out why they had
failed to keep appointments with the doctors, to follow up the
progress of those discharged as cured, and to investigate cases
of illness reported by other patients. The funds available for
such work were limited; when they gave out, Cynthia drew on her
own well-filled pocket-book and kept no account of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rohan and her son Patsy were among the regular attendants
at the clinic. They had been coming once a week for a long time
past. Both had epilepsy. The mother, a widow, had the appearance
of a normal woman, but was crushed with misfortune and overwork;
the boy was one of Cynthia's most repellant cases. Subnormal
mentally and physically, he was seventeen years old, but except
for the sprouting moustache on his lip looked like a boy of
twelve. There was a furtive glitter in his eye but he scarcely
ever spoke. At home there were other children whom Cynthia had
never seen. None of these children should have been born; but
there they were, and it was not their fault.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon near closing time, Patsy turned up at the
clinic alone. The Rohans had no appointment that day. He hung
about, peeping around the corner of the corridor until Cynthia
caught sight of him and beckoned him to her desk. He slunk
forward with his upper lip lifted like a frightened animal's.
"Mom's sick," he blurted out.</p>

<p>Cynthia drew a long breath in the effort to conquer her
repulsion. "What's the matter with her?" she asked. "I dunno.
She's on the bed. She can't get up. The kids is crying because
they ain't eaten since morning."</p>

<p>Cynthia glanced at her watch. "All right. You run home and
tell your mother I'll be there in a quarter of an hour. I'll give
you money to buy milk and crackers for the children to keep them
quiet until I come."</p>

<p>Patsy cringed. "I better take you there," he said. "It's a
hard place to find."</p>

<p>"All right," said Cynthia. "Sit down until I'm ready."</p>

<p>The last of the patients had gone into the examination rooms.
She made haste to clean up her desk and file the case histories.
The boy's veiled glance never leaving her face made her vaguely
uneasy. It was impossible to guess what was passing through his
mind-if he had a mind. He looked like a stunted weed grown in
arid soil.</p>

<p>They left the hospital together. In the street Cynthia hailed
a taxi and Patsy grinned. "I never rode in one of them
before."</p>

<p>He gave an address in the North-east corner of the island
which Cynthia knew to be one of the most depressed areas in the
city. After they had started he said uneasily: "Tell the guy to
stop at the corner of First Avenue. If we was to stop in front of
my house the street kids would razz the life out of me."</p>

<p>Cynthia passed the word to the driver. She kept to her corner
of the cab. The boy was clean enough&mdash;his hard-working
mother saw to that, but he seemed to emanate a moral decay.
Meanwhile he was enjoying the drive. "When I get money," he
boasted with a leer, "I'll drive around in a taxi all day. And
when I get hungry I'll go in a restrunt and order a T-bone steak.
And I'll take my girl to the movies."</p>

<p>Cynthia glanced at him in horror. "Your girl?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I got a girl."</p>

<p>"You'll have to work for the money," she said. "Aah!" he
sneered. "It's only the dumb clucks 'at works for wages. There's
ways of getting the jack without working."</p>

<p>Cynthia shivered inwardly. She felt that it was useless to try
to reason with him.</p>

<p>They got out on First Avenue and headed East. Cynthia had
never visited this particular block. The tenement houses were
ancient and decaying; some of them, condemned by the authorities,
had their doors and windows boarded up; occasionally a house had
been pulled down, leaving a gap in the row like a missing tooth.
It had grown dark. The night was unseasonably mild; doors and
windows stood open; children were playing in the streets. Patsy,
glancing at the big boys in terror, pressed against Cynthia.</p>

<p>She took his hand though his touch made her flesh crawl.
Coming to a small grocery store, she said: "I'll get milk and
crackers here for the children."</p>

<p>"Don't stop! Don't stop!" he said with an odd excitement.
"After I take you to my mom I'll come back and get it." They went
on.</p>

<p>He led her into an old house whose greasy doorway was flush
with the sidewalk. Inside a dim bulb lighted a long narrow hall
with a splintery floor. A steep stairway went up at the side.
Cynthia made for the stairway, but the boy pulled her past it.
"It's in the back," he said. "We live in a backyard
tenement."</p>

<p>The light of the single bulb scarcely penetrated to the back
of the hall. Suddenly Cynthia realised that something was wrong,
and stopped. She could see through an open door at the back of
the hall. There was no house in the rear, but only a littered
yard, a broken fence and the rear of a boarded-up house fronting
on the next street. "You have been lying to me..." she began. She
got no further. There was a figure lurking under the stairs. A
heavy blow descended on her head, stunning her. She did not lose
consciousness altogether but all her faculties were paralysed
except that of hearing. The cellar door beside her was thrown
back and she was hastily dragged down the stairs. She could hear
her own heels thudding from step to step. The boy pulled the door
shut and ran down after her.</p>

<p>In the cellar she was flung on her face on the earthen floor
and the man knelt on her back, crushing the breath out of her. He
drew a cloth of some sort over her mouth. Her senses were
returning to her. As she opened her mouth to scream, he jerked
the cloth between her teeth, almost splitting her lips and
choking off all sounds. He pulled her hands behind her to tie
them. "Light the candle," he growled.</p>

<p>A match was struck and a little light spread around. The boy
placed the stub of a candle on the earth. His sub-human face was
wreathed in a grin. Cynthia could not see the man who was holding
her down. He said in his husky whisper: "Set the yard door
open."</p>

<p>The boy went away. The man was swiftly tying Cynthia's wrists
and ankles together. When the boy returned the man said: "Watch
the cellar stairs."</p>

<p>"Nobody comes down here but the gasman," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Watch the stairs."</p>

<p>"Where's my money?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Open her pocket-book."</p>

<p>After a moment the boy said: "There's only twenty-three
dollars in it."</p>

<p>"All right, take it and get."</p>

<p>"You promised me a hundred," whined the boy.</p>

<p>"Get out!" growled the man.</p>

<p>The boy began to cry. "If you don't give me my hundred I'll
tell!" he wailed.</p>

<p>The man sprang to his feet with a muttered oath. The boy
started to run, but was overtaken in two strides. They had passed
out of Cynthia's range of vision, but she heard the sickly crack
of something hard on a human skull, and the soft collapse of a
body on the earth.</p>

<p>The man returned to her. When he finished his knots he turned
her over on her back and then for the first, as he bent over her,
Cynthia saw him; the tall hulking frame in the shapeless yellow
coat, the queer cap pulled close over his head. He had a black
handkerchief tied over the lower part of his face; his glasses
glittered in the candlelight, hiding the expression of his eyes.
Instinctively Cynthia screamed with all her might, but only a
strangled groan issued through the gag. The man pulled a gun from
his pocket, and showed it to her lying on his palm. "Keep quiet,"
he whispered hoarsely, "or you'll get what the boy got."</p>

<p>Looking beyond her feet, she saw the pitiful thin figure
sprawling on the foul earth. Blood was running through his sparse
hair. She became quiet. She could not make noise enough to be
heard; she wanted to save her strength.</p>

<p>Stepping over her body, the man trod out the candle flame.
Returning, he took her under the arms and dragged her to a stone
stair at the back of the cellar. He dropped her here and went
ahead to investigate. Returning, he dragged her out into the open
yard. As the back wall of the tenement rose before her with
lights in a score of kitchen windows, Cynthia struggled with all
her force and endeavoured to scream again. The man struck her
savagely and she became quiet. It was useless.</p>

<p>He dragged her across to the broken fence and, lifting her up,
coolly dropped her on the other side. Though he was such a big
fellow, he was panting from his exertions. This was the yard of
the abandoned house. It was heaped with piles of rubbish over
which the man dragged her anyhow. They came to another cellar
door. He pulled her through it and down a half stair, and,
letting her fall on a cement floor, went back to shut the door.
It had glass panes, and the upper part of his body was
silhouetted against it. He lingered there, apparently stuffing
the cracks of the door to prevent any sounds from escaping.</p>

<p>At this moment Cynthia's heart was ready to break with
despair. Bound and gagged in the cellar of an abandoned house; at
the mercy of an armed madman! Then she discovered, that in her
rough passage across the yard the ropes around her ankles had
loosened, and hope stirred in her again. While the man was
working at the door, she drew her legs up behind her, and hooking
fingers under a strand of the rope, managed to work it over a
heel. The rest was easy. When he came down the cellar steps her
legs were free.</p>

<p>He struck a match in order to find her. In the brief flash of
light Cynthia saw a dozen paces away, an open stairway leading
up. She scrambled to her feet and raced for it. The man came
after her, cursing, but his match went out and he couldn't stop
to light another. He sprawled over the bottom steps. Drawing his
gun, he fired in the direction of Cynthia's racing feet, but the
shot went wild. Cynthia gained the ground floor hall of the house
and leaned against the wall, trembling. The crash of the shot
turned her blood to water.</p>

<p>Presently she heard him softly inching up the cellar stairs.
Feeling her way along the hall with her forehead, she came to an
open door and slipped through it. She discovered that all the
doors and window sashes had been taken out and stacked against
the walls. At the top of the stairs the man struck a match, but
remained standing and listening, uncertain which way Cynthia had
gone.</p>

<p>The rope around Cynthia's wrists was partly loosened. Backing
up to one of the doors leaning against the wall, she hooked a
strand of the rope over the door handle and brought down her
hands with a sharp jerk. The pull almost dislocated her wrists,
but the rope came off and her hands were free. The man heard the
sound, and started towards the door of the room she was in,
striking a match. Feeling her way around the wall, she found
another door and passed through it.</p>

<p>The man was following her and the dreadful thought came to her
that he had her trapped in a room with only one door. But there
was another room beyond it, and a fourth room beyond that. This
was a front room; thin cracks of light showed between the planks
nailed in the window openings, and sounds of the street came
through, filling Cynthia with a sickness of longing. She had
loosened the gag until it fell around her neck but she uttered no
cry. Long before help could reach her from the outside, the man
with the gun would have been upon her.</p>

<p>This front room had a door opening on the main corridor of the
house, and she stood there listening. For some moments she had
heard no sound of creeping feet or striking matches, and she
didn't know where the man was. Listening somewhere, like herself.
Cynthia's desperately sharpened wits had figured out the ground
plan of this house. She knew that the cellar stairs were to the
rear of the corridor and about forty feet from where she stood.
She had seen the man stuffing the cracks of the door into the
yard below, but she had not heard him lock that door. Apparently
he had no key to it. If she could reach it first, safety lay on
the other side. It was worth trying. She slipped off her
shoes.</p>

<p>Nerving herself up for it, she dashed for the head of the
stairs. The man, waiting, somewhere in the rear, heard her and
divined her intention. He was nearer the stairs; they collided at
the top and he flung an arm around her. His panting breath was in
her face. She sensed that his gun was in his other hand. He was
between her and the stairs. Cynthia, with the strength of
desperation, launched her body against his, at the same time
gripping the door frame. He toppled clutching at her wildly. His
hold was torn loose and he went over backwards. His gun
discharged as he fell.</p>

<p>An absolute silence succeeded the crash. Cynthia, listening,
out of line of possible further shots, prayed that he might be
seriously injured. Moments passed and she could hear nothing.
Unable to bear the suspense, she moved one of the doors to the
head of the stairs and let it slide down on its edge. It slapped
over on the concrete below. So he was not on the stairs. Cynthia
went down a few steps and looked towards the rear of the cellar.
At the same moment the man struck a match to see what had caused
the clatter on the stairs. He was lying in wait for her at the
yard door, the only way out.</p>

<p>Drawing back out of sight, Cynthia softly returned to the
front room on the first floor. Picking up another door, she
launched it on edge like a battering ram against one of the
planks over the window. The plank creaked but held fast. Before
she could strike a second blow she heard him running up the
cellar stairs. Dropping the door, she softly retreated through
the rooms into the rear. He ran straight through the corridor
into the front room, and joy welled up in her heart. The way out
was clear!</p>

<p>She ran down the stairs on stockinged feet, and across the
cellar. He had wedged a stick under the handle of the door to
hold it fast, but it was the work of a second to kick that aside,
and she breathed the sweet outer air again. She heard him
plunging down the stairs, and scrambled anyhow over the piles of
rubbish in the yard; fell over the fence, found the doorway to
the house in front, and running through it, gained the sidewalk.
There were people standing about. She sank down fainting at their
feet.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch22" name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Cynthia opened her eyes again it was to
find the blessed Irish face of a policeman bending over her. The
people of the neighbourhood were staring down at her curiously.
"What happened, Miss?" asked the policeman. "A man seized me,"
she stammered. "He dragged me into an abandoned house in the next
street. He killed Patsy Rohan."</p>

<p>A murmur of horror travelled around the circle. "What kind of
man?" asked the policeman.</p>

<p>"A big man. Wore a yellow overcoat, cap pulled down close over
his head."</p>

<p>Several voices spoke up at once: "I saw him! He come out of
the house and went down towards the river."</p>

<p>A radio car with two more policemen had drawn up at the curb
alongside. Word was passed to the driver and they set off to look
for the man.</p>

<p>Cynthia's policeman asked: "Where do you live, Miss?"</p>

<p>Afraid of entering her own place alone, she gave the address
of Lee's apartment. "Amos Lee Mappin!" said the policeman,
surprised. "I read about him. I'll take you there."</p>

<p>A taxi was brought from First Avenue and they got in.</p>

<p>Lee lived on an upper floor of one of the lofty apartment
houses overlooking the East River. When they arrived at the door,
he paled at the sight of Cynthia's limp figure, and the arms that
took her trembled. He laid her on a couch in his living-room. The
policeman told his story. Lee asked a few pointed questions; made
no comment. "Miss Dordress will be available for questioning any
time she may be needed," he told the policeman.</p>

<p>When he had gone. Lee telephoned to Headquarters. He was told
that Inspector Loasby had gone to the station house of the 5th
precinct to direct the search for the murderer. Lee got him there
and Loasby told him that the man in the yellow coat had not been
apprehended. He had last been seen getting in a taxi which headed
South on East River Drive. A general alarm had been sent out for
him. "That's not likely to produce anything," said Lee. "He was
disguised, of course. He will change it now."</p>

<p>Loasby went on to say that the body of Patsy Rohan had been
found in the cellar. The boy's mother, who lived upstairs, was
dazed by what had happened. No suspicion attached to her in the
minds of the police. "I'll pay for the wretch's burial," said
Lee. "Don't mention my name."</p>

<p>When the police had searched the abandoned house in the next
street, Loasby said, they found on the cement floor at the foot
of the cellar stairs, a small flat key with a number cut in the
shaft, number 415. "A hotel key?" asked Lee. "No. Hotel keys have
the name of the hotel engraved on them. This key is too small and
thin for a room key."</p>

<p>"I'll come up and take a look at it," said Lee.</p>

<p>Returning to Cynthia he said: "The man has not been caught.
Evidently he worked single-handed. Watching the clinic for days
past, I take it. In the imbecile boy he found just the tool he
needed."</p>

<p>"Why did he attack me?" murmured Cynthia. "I have never harmed
him."</p>

<p>"He was afraid. We are getting too close to him. He doesn't
know that I have consulted the police. He thought if he could
make away with you, then with me, he would be safe. And O, God!
How nearly he succeeded with you! We might never have found you!"
Lee struggled with his feelings. "Did you have a small key marked
415?" he asked in his customary matter-of-fact voice.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Only my apartment key. That was in the bag
they took."</p>

<p>"The brute will be desperate now," said Lee. "We must act
quickly. I'll send for Fanny to stay with you. Jermyn will take
care of you both. You are quite safe here."</p>

<p>"You are going out?" she said, freshly terrified.</p>

<p>"Only to see Loasby."</p>

<p>"O, Lee, be careful! If anything happened to you...!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry," he said grimly. "If he tries anything with me,
I'll be ready for him."</p>

<p>Telling his man Jermyn to phone Miss Parran to come and stay
with Cynthia, and not to let anybody else into the apartment
until he returned, Lee taxied up to Harlem.</p>

<p>Loasby was in the Captain's private office, attended by
Riordan, a young detective who acted as his secretary and aide.
Both were in plain clothes. The handsome Inspector was angered by
this dirty crime and inclined to blame Lee for not having
prevented it. Lee ignored his ill-humour. As soon as Lee laid
eyes on the key found by the police, he said: "I know what sort
of key that is. I have often used them. They are for the lock
boxes in railway stations where you drop a dime and check your
bag."</p>

<p>"They have such boxes in fifty places around town," said
Loasby, scowling.</p>

<p>"They are all put out by the same company. Phone quick to the
head office and ask where box number 415 is. Arrange to have a
watch put on it."</p>

<p>Riordan did the telephoning. "Pennsylvania Terminal," he
reported.</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Lee, making for the door.</p>

<p>Loasby and Riordan followed. "It he's lost the key," Loasby
grumbled, "he won't go back to the box."</p>

<p>"Man," said Lee, "with a general alarm out for him, if his
other clothes are in that box, it's a matter of life and death
for him to get them."</p>

<p>In a red police car with blue searchlight and screaming siren,
they made the Pennsylvania Terminal in nine minutes. In the local
office of the checking company they were faced by a frightened
manager. "You're too late," he stammered. "He's been and got his
things.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!...I didn't know he was wanted."</p>

<p>Lee clenched his teeth together and silently cursed their ill
luck. "What sort of man?" demanded the Inspector.</p>

<p>The manager repeated the too-familiar description of the man
in the yellow overcoat. "He said he had lost his key," he went
on. "He was in a hurry to catch a train. He described everything
that was in the box, and offered to pay for a new lock. So I
opened the box for him. That is our rule."</p>

<p>"What was in it?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"A yellow gladstone bag, sir, considerably scuffed and worn.
It contained a black vicuna overcoat, a black soft hat rolled up,
a blue cheviot suit, black shoes and socks, a white shirt that
had been worn, with collar attached, a blue tie, a tin
box..."</p>

<p>"What was in the box?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask him to open it."</p>

<p>"How long ago was this?"</p>

<p>"Less than half an hour, sir."</p>

<p>"Didn't strike you as strange," said the Inspector sternly,
"that a man looking like that should have such fine clothes in
his bag?"</p>

<p>"I thought they were his Sunday clothes, Inspector."</p>

<p>"You should..."</p>

<p>Lee shut Loasby off. "I know why he chose the Pennsylvania
station to check his things. Downstairs they have rooms for the
convenience of travellers who may wish to change their clothes.
He may still be there. Come on!"</p>

<p>Lee, Loasby and Riordan hastened to the stairway on the North
side of the concourse and ran down. The spotless glass-tiled
lavatory opened off the basement corridor. It was lined down to
the far end with a row of little dressing-rooms, each having a
mahogany door with a slot machine in the lock to receive dimes.
Halfway down the long row there was an arched opening leading to
another division of the lavatory. The attendant of the place was
standing near the entrance. Loasby gave him a brief flash of the
gold badge. "Have you seen a man in here during the last half
hour wearing a yellowish kind of overcoat?" he asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "I got to watch the nickel side, too,
Inspector. I don't see them all."</p>

<p>"This was an unusual looking man, a hulking fellow,
stoop-shouldered; wore a leather helmet pulled down close over his
head, thick spectacles; was carrying an old gladstone bag."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I seen such a one," said the man suddenly. "Here, on
the dime side. He went into a box halfway down. It would be
number nine, ten or eleven. For all I know he's still there."</p>

<p>Before the attendant had finished speaking, a door in the
middle of the long row silently opened, and like a shadow, a tall
man slipped across the narrow space and through the opening into
the other side of the lavatory. He kept his head turned from
them, and they could not see his face. Black hat, black overcoat
now, but the anxiety to escape observation gave him away. "There
he goes!" cried the Inspector.</p>

<p>He and Riordan instinctively sprang forward to look in the box
he had just vacated. Lee, figuring that the man would have to
come out into the corridor through the next opening, turned in
the other direction to head him off. "Stop that man!" roared
Loasby to those beyond.</p>

<p>Lee collided with the running man in the next opening to the
corridor. The man was holding an arm over his face. He charged
full tilt into Lee, sending him sprawling on his back in the
corridor while he sprang for the stairs. When Lee got his breath,
the man was disappearing around the top of the stairs. Lee added
his voice to the bellowing Inspector. "Stop that man!" A whole
row of bootblacks stopped work and leaped up the stairs, brushes
and rags in hand. The customers climbed out of the chairs and
followed. Up above the cry was taken up: "Stop that man!"</p>

<p>When Lee reached the great concourse above, he had another
glimpse of the man as he headed obliquely across for the doors
leading to the outer concourse. He was slimmer than Lee expected,
and not stoop-shouldered at all. Desperation was lending him the
speed of a deer. A door obediently opened for him and he
disappeared through it. The cries were echoing from end to end of
the vast hall: "Stop that man!" Men came running from every
direction to join the chase. The crowd got tangled up in the
mechanical doors and the fugitive gained on them.</p>

<p>When Lee reached the outer concourse, the man had almost got
to the Thirty-first Street side of the building. Men directly in
his path scuttled out of the way, and fell in at a safe distance
behind him. The crowd was roaring. The fugitive was clever enough
not to spring up the wide stairs to the street where he would
certainly have been caught. Running under the stairway, he
plunged down the steps leading to the mezzanine corridor that
bisects the huge building from side to side. This is the busiest
part of the terminal, with crowds pouring up from the train
platforms below, another crowd waiting to meet friends and more
hundreds passing to and from the subway and the taxi
landings.</p>

<p>This huddle of people instinctively parted to let the running
man through, and none dared lay hands on him. The great crowd
that pursued him could not get through the crowd that already
choked the corridor and the man gained steadily. His progress was
punctuated by the sharp screams of the women he hustled. Running
alongside Lee, the face of the dignified Inspector had become
purple. "If you catch him it means promotion," he shouted to
Riordan, and put out a hand to stop Lee. "Let the young men run,"
he panted. "This is no work for us!"</p>

<p>"I'm not done yet," said Lee. He ran on, leaving Loasby.</p>

<p>Midway through the corridor, there was a side corridor leading
in the direction of the subway station a block away. The fugitive
had passed out of hearing and the pursuers halted irresolutely.
Some said he had headed for the subway, others said straight
ahead. The main body decided for the subway and started charging
through the tiled corridor. It he had gone that way, they would
catch him on the platform. Lee thought, and he, Riordan and a few
others kept on towards the Thirty-third Street side where the
taxis waited. This part of the mezzanine was less crowded at the
moment.</p>

<p>While they were still fifty yards away, through the glass of
the doors leading to the taxi platform, they saw their man
getting into a cab. "Stop that man!" they yelled, but the
taxi-driver either could not or did not want to hear, and the cab
whirled out of sight into the ramp leading to the street. They
piled into the next cab. They found the first cab stopped at the
head of the ramp by a red light. Coming up behind it, they leaped
out, each with a gun in hand. But the cab ahead was empty. "The
so-and-so jumped out and run down Eighth Avenue," said the driver
disgustedly. "I couldn't leave my cab."</p>

<p>In the crowded sidewalk of Eighth Avenue there was no sign of
their man. "He's smart enough to have run back into the station,"
muttered Lee. Turning in through the Eighth Avenue entrance of
the terminal, they stood for a moment at the top of the great
stairway, searching the outer concourse. He was not to be seen.
Half a dozen of the train gates were open, and there were doors
everywhere to the telephone room, the main concourse, the
different waiting-rooms. An ordinary looking man in black hat and
overcoat, it was child's play for him to lose himself in that
labyrinth. "He has diddled us," growled Lee.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23" name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">LEE and Riordan joined Inspector Loasby in the
police sub-station attached to the Terminal. Loasby had the
gladstone bag found in the dressing-room. He had taken all the
usual measures. There were already twenty detectives in the
station and more on the way. The half dozen trains then ready to
depart were held until they could be searched, and men were
placed at every exit from the huge building. Telegrams were
dispatched to all stations down the line. While they awaited the
result, Lee and the Inspector snatched a hasty and gloomy meal at
the lunch counter. They were not much surprised to learn when
they had finished that the fugitive had made a clean getaway.
Loasby prepared to return to Headquarters. "I'd be glad to have
you with me," he said to Lee. "I'm organising a search that will
comb this town with fine teeth. Two heads are better than
one."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lee. "Let me telephone home first."</p>

<p>Jermyn told him over the wire that Miss Cynthia was all right.
Miss Fanny was with her. He had served their dinner and they had
eaten well. Nobody had called at the apartment. "Any telephone
calls?"</p>

<p>"One, sir. About fifteen minutes ago a man called up. He
wouldn't give his name. Said his initials were R.F.S and that you
would know him. The voice was unfamiliar to me."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Lee, "a new man that I have working
for me. What did he want?"</p>

<p>"Wanted to get in touch with you, sir. Said he had secured an
important piece of evidence that he must put in your hands to-night.
I suggested that he come to the apartment, but he said he
had a man under observation and he couldn't take the time to come
up here. But he said he was close to your office, and if you were
going to be there any time this evening, he could run over with
it. He said he'd call up the office at intervals to see if you
were there."</p>

<p>Lee's glum face lightened a little. An important piece of
evidence! This R. F. S was a first-rate operative. "All right,"
he said to Jermyn. "I'll go right over there and wait an hour for
a call. If he should call you again, tell him I'm there. He'll
find the door of the building locked, but there's a bell which
rings in the hall. I'll come down and let him in."</p>

<p>To Loasby, Lee said: "I've got to go over to my office for an
hour. One of the operatives is coming in. He says he has
something. I'll see you later."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Loasby.</p>

<p>Lee took a taxi for his office. He rented a suite in an old
brownstone dwelling in the Murray Hill section of Madison Avenue,
that had been converted into business offices. Strictly speaking,
Lee was only an amateur criminologist, but he paid the rent of
this place rather than have queer and unsavoury characters come
to his apartment. He could afford it. His quarters consisted of a
large room across the front of the second floor and two little
rooms opening off it.</p>

<p>The building was locked up when he got there. Nobody stayed in
it at night. As he let himself into the dark stair hall the
thought flitted across his mind: Maybe I'm foolish to come here
alone at night. He thrust it away. Nonsense! I'm safely locked in
here. If anybody rings the bell I can look out of the window to
make sure it's the man I want to see before I go down. I'm armed,
and I have the telephone. What could happen to me? And anyhow the
murderer is not going to try on anything else to-night after the
scare we gave him in the station!</p>

<p>Switching on a light in the lower hall, he climbed the old
stairs with their elaborate carved balustrade, and let himself
into the front office above. He switched on the lights and pulled
down the blinds. Lee had installed opaque blinds on the windows
because when he had to work late at night he didn't want to
advertise the fact to the street. He hung his coat and hat on a
tree in the corner and switched on the telephone extension so
that he could take any call that might come on his own desk.</p>

<p>Lee's little private office opened off the big room at the
back. It was windowless, but had its door on the corridor, so
that Lee could slip out that way it there were callers in the
front room that he did not care to see. This door had a spring
lock; also it had a black shade drawn down over the glass so
Lee's light would not shine in the corridor. Opposite the
corridor door was a third door leading to a little room
corresponding to Lee's, where Fanny carried her work when she
wished to be undisturbed. This door was usually kept shut but was
not locked. Lee naturally left the door between the front office
and his own room open when he passed through it. He turned on a
desk light and lit a cigar. On his desk, where Fanny had left
them, lay the newly-arrived proofs and the type-script of his
forthcoming book entitled Murder Without Reason. It included half
a dozen fantastic homicide cases that he had dug up. He sat down
at his desk and pushed the proofs aside while he waited for his
telephone call. He had a more pressing case on his mind now.</p>

<p>He drew on his cigar and allowed the smoke to escape slowly.
The events of the day forced him to take a new view of the
matter. Up until now he had had it at the back of his mind that
the murderer of Gavin Dordress was a hired killer. His recent
acts suggested that he was the sole head and front of the affair;
a man who worked alone; of all types of criminal the most
difficult to run down. He appeared to be rendered desperate by
the failure of his schemes. Either that or he was an out and out
madman. Lee scowled. What could a logical mind do with a madman?
A new theory began to form in his mind, but he had no evidence to
support it. He glanced wistfully at the telephone. If the
operative on the trail of the old typewriter had really turned up
something, perhaps they could take the murderer in flank. Why
didn't the fellow call up?</p>

<p>It was as quiet as a burial vault in the empty house. The
windows were closed and the noises from the street came in
faintly. There is almost no traffic in that part of Madison
Avenue after nightfall; occasionally Lee heard the purr of a
taxi-cab and at longer intervals a motor-bus rumbled past the
house. From farther away came the dull vibration of the Third
Avenue El. There are no theatres or night resorts within hailing
distance of respectable Murray Hill.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cold fear struck into Lee's breast. He had heard no
distinct sound, but a sixth sense told him that there was
somebody in the front room. "Who's there?" he said sharply. No
answer came. Only a silence so intense that it seemed to breathe.
He jumped up to go in, but thinking better of it, switched off
the light on his desk. Instantly an unseen hand switched off the
lights in the front room, plunging the whole suite in darkness.
Lee inwardly cursed the black window shades then. He thrust a
hand in his pocket only to remember that he had dropped his gun
in his overcoat pocket when he came out into Eighth Avenue. He
crouched behind his desk, sweating profusely. Fool! Fool! Fool!
he thought. The eminent criminologist is nicely trapped!</p>

<p>When his eyes became more accustomed to the darkness, he
perceived that there was a little light striking into the front
room through the thick glass of the corridor door. There was no
shade on this door. He had left a light burning in the entrance
hall of the house, but there was no light on the landing outside
his suite. The light was very faint, but sufficient to reveal
anybody who might try to steal into his office from in front. Lee
was very sure that the man in front could not see him.</p>

<p>Keeping his eye on the door his hand stole up to the French
telephone on his desk, and silently lifted the instrument. The
instant he put the receiver to his ear he realised that the line
was dead. There was no response from the operator; the wires had
been cut. Lee put the instrument back on his desk. It made a
little rap on the wood, and in the front room a man softly
chuckled. Lee shivered at the sound.</p>

<p>If the man was lying in wait for him just outside the door,
there was a possibility that he could creep around through
Fanny's room and take him in the rear. He could retrieve his gun
on the way. Breathing with open mouth to make no sound, he
started creeping on hands and knees towards the closed door. The
ten feet was like a journey of ten miles, an inch at a time, and
a pause to listen. Arriving at the door, he had a still more
difficult task to open it without giving warning.</p>

<p>It finally swung in silently, and he dropped to hands and
knees again. He was familiar with the position of every object in
Fanny's little room. The door into the front room was standing
open. Just outside it stood a hat tree. When Lee stuck his head
into the front room he glimpsed against the faint light coming in
from the corridor, a shadowy form crouching outside the door of
his private office. On the other side of Lee hung his overcoat.
He softly felt for the pockets-to find them empty. The man had
been before him there. Lee retreated into Fanny's office
trembling violently. It was the man's more than human daring that
cut the ground from under his feet. Thus to brave him on Lee's
own ground!</p>

<p>He got a grip on himself, and started creeping back to his own
office, meaning to try to escape through the door into the
corridor. Suddenly the top light flared on in his room. The man
had been feeling around the edge of the door for the switch. Lee
snatched up a book from Fanny's desk and flung it at the light.
His aim was true; the lamp exploded, and the little room was
plunged in darkness again.</p>

<p>Lee went in there, closing the door after him. None too soon,
for the light blazed on in Fanny's room behind him. Lee flung
himself on the corridor door, but he was unable to open it. The
key had been turned in the ordinary lock, and taken away. At that
moment the man in Fanny's room swung a chair and smashed the
glass in the door. Lee sprang into the front room and turning
about, got the corridor door open and slammed it behind him.</p>

<p>He heard the man coming. He realised in a flash that he could
not hope to get down the hall and down the lighted stairs without
receiving a bullet in his back, and he turned up the stairs.
Rounding the corner, he lay down flat on the steps, holding his
breath. The heavy ornamental balustrade kept any light from
falling on him. The man came charging out of the front room. He
had a handkerchief tied around the lower part of his face, and a
gun in his hand. As he ran he drew a second gun. He paused at the
head of the stairs.</p>

<p>Getting to his feet, Lee made a dash back into the front room.
He slammed the door and, turning the key in the ordinary lock,
threw it away. He heard the man coming and knew he would only
have a second or two. Running obliquely across the room, he flung
up the outside window of the four. At the same moment the glass
of the corridor door crashed and the man put his hand in to feel
for the latch. But he could not open the door; he was still held
up for a few seconds.</p>

<p>Lee climbed out on the window sill. The street below was
almost empty. A taxicab sped past, and across the road he had a
fleeting sense of a couple staring at him, transfixed with
astonishment. They couldn't help him. Lee's figure was not well
adapted for climbing, but under the spur of desperation a man can
perform wonders. Stretching his legs to their widest, he found he
could get a foot on the sill of the end window in the next house.
Still clinging to his own window frame, he got a grip on the next
frame, and drew himself across. The window was closed. Smashing
in the glass with his knee, he lowered himself into a dark
room.</p>

<p>A door slammed back in the room and lights went on. Lee found
himself faced by an indignant man in the doorway with a gun in
his hand. "What the hell does this mean?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" said Lee. "There's a desperate criminal after
me. For God's sake, get out of this room and get the door
shut!"</p>

<p>His voice carried conviction. The man backed out of the room
and allowed Lee to follow him. "Is there a key in this door?"
asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then for God's sake lock it!...Is there any other way out of
the room?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" Lee leaned against the door and closed his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?" demanded the angry householder.</p>

<p>"No," said Lee with a weary grin. "Only a little out of
breath."</p>

<p>"What's the explanation of this?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you...but please lead me to a telephone first."</p>

<p>There was a telephone in the back room on the same floor.
While Lee was using it, his involuntary host watched him
suspiciously, gun in hand. Lee called up Headquarters and got
Loasby on the wire. "This is Lee Mappin," he said. Hearing that
name, the householder relaxed somewhat, and lowered his gun. "The
man was lying in wait for me in my own office," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Good God!" ejaculated Loasby.</p>

<p>"He nearly got me, but I escaped into the house next door.
Next door on the South. It's the residence of Mr..." He looked at
his host. "Sanderson." said he. "The residence of Mr. Sanderson,"
Lee went on to Loasby. "For God's sake, furnish me with a guard,
Loasby. And put a guard in the foyer of my apartment house."</p>

<p>"Surely," said Loasby. "I'll have four cars there in a jiffy.
We'll surround the building where your offices are."</p>

<p>"Just as you like," said Lee, "but he'll be gone. Mr.
Sanderson, I am sure, will allow some of your men to pass through
his house so they can reach the rear of the building next
door."</p>

<p>Sanderson was all friendliness when Lee hung up. The gun was
put away. "I know you by reputation, Mr. Mappin," he said. "What
a terrible thing to happen!"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite," said Lee. "It would be an act of charity, Mr.
Sanderson, if you were to offer me a drink."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch24" name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">ALMOST instantaneously, it seemed, the radio
cars one after another drew up silently in front of the house.
Detectives came to Mr. Sanderson's door, and Lee handed over the
key of the adjoining house. Other men passed through Mr.
Sanderson's basement and climbed the back fence so that they
could command the rear of the office building next door. A few
minutes later Loasby came, and Lee told him in detail what had
happened. "So he thinks he can play with us at his pleasure!"
said the angry Inspector. "By God! I'll catch this fellow if it's
my last act on earth!"</p>

<p>"Surely!" said Lee.</p>

<p>The search, as Lee had expected, was in vain. The disappointed
detectives had presently to report that the man had gone, leaving
no trace except the glass he had broken. Apparently he had come
out by the front door and coolly walked away up the street before
the radio cars arrived. Loasby went back to Headquarters, and Lee
returned to his office, guarded now by two plain-clothes men,
more conspicuous for brawn than for brains. One was red-faced;
one saturnine. Lee was his usual calm self again. Except for the
two broken panes no damage had been done. Judging from the
condition of the drawers of his desk. Lee guessed that the man
had been through his papers before he arrived; however,
everything of importance was locked in the safe.</p>

<p>The two officers effected a temporary splice in the cut
telephone wires, and Lee called up his operative, Smither, who
signed his reports R. F. S. He found him at home.</p>

<p>"Smither," said Lee, "my servant tells me that a man giving
your initials called me up at my apartment this evening, and said
that he had discovered an important piece of evidence that he
wanted to put in my hands to-night. How about it?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Mappin, it's all a fake!" said the surprised
Smither. "I never called you up. As a matter of fact, I haven't
had any luck to-day. Our man never came for the shoes."</p>

<p>"That is what I assumed," said Lee. "You are my principal
dependence in this case, Smither. Can you taxi right down to my
office to talk things over with me?"</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>Smither was a small, meager man of fifty with a gloomy
expression; no genius, but a dependable fellow. He opened his
eyes when he saw the smashed doors. "Yes, our friend made a raid
here to-night," said Lee.</p>

<p>"The man in the yellow overcoat!"</p>

<p>"The very same. We've got the overcoat but we haven't got
him."</p>

<p>"What a nerve!" murmured Smither. "Are the police on his
trail?"</p>

<p>"They are," said Lee. "But I feel that they will never catch
up with him from behind. It's up to you and me to come on him
from an unexpected quarter. You haven't located his hangout?"</p>

<p>Smither shook his head.</p>

<p>Lee gave him a cigar and took one himself. He paced the little
room thoughtfully, talking as much to himself as to Smither.
"Let's see what we've got. You traced him to a store on Sixth
Avenue near Forty-ninth Street. We have established the fact that
his hangout is within two or three minutes walk of that store. It
wouldn't be on Sixth Avenue. With the elevated railway banging
past his windows and the subway diggers drilling underneath, it
would be impossible for a man to work there even if he was only
doing copying. Forty-ninth Street is our best bet; Forty-ninth
Street West of Sixth Avenue. East of Sixth the rents are too
high. Well, you made inquiries up and down Forty-ninth Street and
all you found was a pair of old shoes."</p>

<p>"The shoes are out of my hands now," remarked Smither.
"Headquarters has men watching the store all the time it is open.
They have arranged with the man who runs the store to signal them
if anybody presents a ticket for those shoes."</p>

<p>"Right," said Lee. "But he will never call for them now...Let
me see...Forty-ninth Street is the regular route from Broadway
over to Radio City and the sidewalk is full all day. Consequently
the character of the street has changed very rapidly during the
last year of two. Little modern store fronts have been put in all
along the way. But above the stores most of the old buildings
remain as they were. That block in Forty-ninth Street was always
rather miscellaneous. There are some queer lodgings in those old
buildings, Smither, and I am sure that is where our man had one
of his hangouts."</p>

<p>"One of his hangouts?" questioned Smither.</p>

<p>"His yellow overcoat hangout. The overcoat was part of a
disguise, and he only used that room when he was wearing it...Did
you examine the shoes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What did you get from them?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I could use, sir."</p>

<p>"Old shoes are full of character."</p>

<p>"Sure, they are. But they don't tell you where the wearer's
hangout is."</p>

<p>"Ordinarily, no. Still I think it's worth a trip up to Forty-ninth
Street. Let's go take another look at those shoes,
Smither."</p>

<p>"Okay, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>One of the brawny detectives went with them, the red-faced
one, the other being left on guard in Lee's office. The three men
descended from their taxi at the Sixth Avenue corner and started
West through Forty-ninth Street. The shoe repair shop was not
far. It was one of the usual sort, presided over by an Italian
padrone. It had a lot of shoe-repairing machinery in the
show-window, and in the rear a boot-black stand on one side and
on the other a row of boxes where customers waiting for their shoes
might sit, modestly hiding the holes in their stockings.</p>

<p>Smither was known to the Italian in charge of the place, and
he brought out the shoes on request. A unique pair of shoes,
bright yellow in colour, and made on a toothpick-pointed last
such as one doesn't see outside of France nowadays. "He wore
these on his earlier forays," said Lee. "They went well with the
rest of the outfit."</p>

<p>"A foreign guy," put in the Italian, "no Americano like
us."</p>

<p>While Lee was examining the shoes, the detective on watch
outside came in with a questioning air, showing how good a watch
he was keeping. He and the other detective established contact,
and the first man went back to resume his vigil. "Almost ready to
go to pieces," said Lee, inspecting the shoes. "He picked them up
second-hand somewhere. Look as if they hadn't been cleaned since.
Resoled more than once, and are near ready for another."</p>

<p>"I tella him a need new sole," said the Italian. "Only want
little patches, he say. Gotta no mon'."</p>

<p>Lee turned the shoes over. "It would be interesting to analyse
the black scum that forms on the soles of New York shoes," he
said. "I suppose the constituents are dust, soot and machine oil.
No more horse manure...Look, here's a bit of foreign matter glued
to the sole." He borrowed a knife and, scraping the particle off
on a bit of white paper, studied it through a magnifying glass.
"It's so saturated with the black scum I can't tell...Here's
another bit, fresher, clinging to the inside of the heel.
Sawdust, Smither; what do you make of that?"</p>

<p>Smither shook his head.</p>

<p>Lee pursued his examination with the glass. "There are other
particles of sawdust caught between the welt and the sole; some
fresh, some blackened with dirt. Smither, this man walked in
sawdust on a number of occasions spread over a considerable
period of time. Where would you find sawdust in New York?"</p>

<p>"In a planing and finishing mill."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Take a look through the glass. These are
coarse flakes of sawdust, like that chewed out by a big saw when
it goes through a log."</p>

<p>"There are no logs sawed up around New York."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But the sawdust like this is shipped to the city
for a variety of purposes." Lee studied for a while murmuring to
himself: "Sawdust underfoot...sawdust underfoot...Smither," he
said, raising his head, "sometimes a storekeeper with a nice tile
or mosaic floor spreads sawdust in wet weather to protect it from
the muddy feet of his customers."</p>

<p>"That's right, sir."</p>

<p>"There's been a lot of rain this fall. Let's see what we can
find in Forty-ninth Street."</p>

<p>"But it's fine to-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Never mind, we can ask questions."</p>

<p>To make a long story short, they found three modern stores in
the long block that had such floors. The first was a sandwich
shop, the second a fancy fruiterer's and the third a high-class
delicatessen. The sandwich shop did not use sawdust in rainy
weather, but the other two did. There was a sack of the same kind
of sawdust in the back of the delicatessen store. But the
proprietors of both these stores insisted that they had never
seen nor served a person answering to the description of the man
in the yellow overcoat. "No luck!" Smither said dejectedly, as
they came out of the delicatessen.</p>

<p>"O, I wouldn't say that," returned Lee. He was standing on the
sidewalk looking up at the windows over the store. Whoever had
put in this modern store had not considered it worth while to
recondition the rest of the house. It had a shabby air. "I didn't
expect to find that the man dealt with these stores. They're too
expensive."</p>

<p>"Then what was your object in asking, sir?"</p>

<p>"Just to give me a chance to look around...Notice that the man
who designed this store," he went on, "in order to get as much
frontage as possible for the show-window, put in the store door
at the side. The little entry to the door has a nice tiled floor
and of course the storekeeper would spread his sawdust on it,
because that would be the spot to get most of the mud from the
feet of the customers. But that little entry also leads to the
door serving the upstairs part of the house. Look at that door,
Smither."</p>

<p>It was a modern door in conformity with the rest of the store
front. Inside the glass was pasted the word: Vacancy. "Let's go
up," said Lee.</p>

<p>He pressed the bell, and the door was opened by a push button
from above. The landlady, a chronically suspicious woman like
most of her profession, waited for them at the head of the
stairs. She was surprised at the request of three prosperous-looking
gentlemen to look at rooms at that hour, but proceeded to
show them the best she had, a large, shabbily-furnished, second
floor front. "Isn't this a very noisy street?" said Lee.</p>

<p>"Nothing out of the ordinary, sir. Only automobile traffic.
The El is too far away to trouble you."</p>

<p>"I am a literary man. I must have quiet."</p>

<p>"I already have a literary gentleman, sir. He works here
especial for the quiet. Third floor hall. His home is in
Jersey."</p>

<p>Lee's calm eye lighted up inwardly. Otherwise his face showed
no change. "What does he write?" he asked idly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you that, sir. He's a foreign gentleman, a
Polack, I should say. Speaks broken. But always the
gentleman."</p>

<p>"What's his name-not that it matters."</p>

<p>"Jan Dubinski, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! Does he by chance wear a yellowish overcoat when he goes
out?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir! A foreign-made overcoat. So you know him!"</p>

<p>"Slightly. Can we trouble you to show us his room?"</p>

<p>"I can't do that, sir. He locks it when he goes out."</p>

<p>"But you must have a key in order to clean it."</p>

<p>"No, sir. He don't sleep here. He sweeps it himself when
necessary."</p>

<p>"Then we must force the door. We are from the police
department. We are interested in Mr. Dubinski. I will pay for any
damage we do."</p>

<p>The Headquarters detective flashed his badge.</p>

<p>The woman's hand went to her mouth. "O, dear, I don't want no
trouble!" she murmured. "Such a quiet man!"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," said Lee. "If this is the man we want, it
doesn't reflect on you at all. Please show us the room."</p>

<p>She led the way up two more flights and pointed to a door in
front. The detective rattled it. The old door was loose. "I want
a strong screw-driver," he said; "or a chisel, or any thin tool.
A poker will do if you've got nothing better."</p>

<p>She fetched him a poker and he forced the door expertly. "What
was your profession before you joined the force?" asked Lee
mildly.</p>

<p>Gum-shoes didn't get it. "Truck-driver," he said without a
smile.</p>

<p>This was a tiny room, the cheapest in the house. It contained
a narrow bed, a scarred bureau, a kitchen table and chair by the
window. The floor was covered with a dusty carpet having most of
the nap worn off. On the table stood a typewriter, and Lee went
to it straight. There were sheets of paper alongside; he put one
in the machine and struck a few keys. The worn letters and the
new exclamation point were instantly recognisable. "This is the
typewriter," said Lee, "and your lodger is the man we're looking
for."</p>

<p>"O dear," she said. "What's he done?"</p>

<p>Lee didn't want to give the woman a fit by mentioning murder.
"I can't tell you. Read the papers." He pulled out the drawers in
the bureau. They were perfectly empty. There was a shallow drawer
in the table. Nothing there but more blank sheets of paper and
carbon paper. "Look under the mattress," he said to Smither.
"Feel under the carpet all over the room."</p>

<p>Smither, having done so, shook his head. "I have reason to
believe he has something hidden here," insisted Lee.</p>

<p>"Where else is there to look, sir, in such a dump?"</p>

<p>"Examine the mattress," said Lee. "Make certain that it has
not been ripped open and sewed up again." Meanwhile, with his
magnifying glass, Lee was examining the woodwork of the room;
door frame, baseboard, window frame and sill. The top floor
window in this old house was close to the floor. He discovered
that the old paint in the cracks of the window-sill was broken.
"This board has been taken out at some time," he said. "See if
you can pry it up with your poker, officer."</p>

<p>The sill came up with unexpected ease. Beneath it, in the
narrow space between lathes and brick, a thin package wrapped in
newspaper was standing on edge. Upon being opened, it was found
to contain a carbon copy of the play Sin, in the same worn type.
Lee, who expected this, scarcely glanced at it. But in the hole
there was also a long manilla envelope and he pounced on that. It
contained a sheaf of letter-size sheets covered with
miscellaneous typewritten notes. The first entries told Lee what
a find he had made, and he smiled at last. "This is worth all our
trouble," he said softly to Smither. "With this we will send him
to the chair!"</p>

<p>"We got to catch him first," said Smither gloomily, "What is
it, sir?"</p>

<p>"The contents of Gavin Dordress' note-book. That note-book was
missing after the murder. The murderer dared not keep the book
itself, but he copied it out before destroying it. Notes for
plots, for characters, for scenes. He needed that in the
future."</p>

<p>"If the book is destroyed can you prove in court that these
notes came out of it?"</p>

<p>"I reckon so," said Lee, folding the papers. "I'll study the
entries at my leisure...Hello! here's something else." He drew
out a small ruled sheet perforated along one edge. "A page from
the note-book itself! So much the better!"</p>

<p>"What funny-looking writing," said Smither, looking over Lee's
shoulder. "It's a kind of puzzle, isn't it? I can't make nothing
of it."</p>

<p>"He couldn't either," said Lee. "And he saved it until he
could. He thought, because this one entry was written in cipher,
that it must be specially important to him. Maybe it is. I'll
have a try at deciphering it when I get home."</p>

<p>He returned the papers to the envelope, and stowed the
envelope carefully in his breast pocket. "That will be all," he
said cheerfully. "We will have to carry away all these papers;
also the typewriter. The officer will give you a formal receipt
for them, ma'am...And please accept this from me for your
trouble."</p>

<p>It was a twenty dollar bill. The astonished woman stammered
her thanks. She was not prepared for such liberality from the
police.</p>

<p>From the delicatessen store Lee called up Headquarters.
"Loasby," he said, "do you have Hillman, Gavin Dordress' former
butler, under surveillance?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Can you get in touch with the man who is watching him?"</p>

<p>"In two minutes."</p>

<p>"Good, I'm about to telephone Hillman to ask him to come to my
apartment. If he comes, all right. If he tries to escape, he's to
be arrested instantly."</p>

<p>"I get you, Lee. Want me up there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please. I have important new evidence. Give Hillman time
to get down town first. Bring the old gladstone bag and its
contents with you."</p>

<p>"Right. I'll be at your place in three-quarters of an
hour."</p>

<p>Lee then called the Harvest Restaurant in the Bronx. Hillman
himself answered the phone. "Hillman," said Lee, "could you
oblige me by coming down to my apartment?"</p>

<p>After a silence Hillman said nervously: "Why certainly, Mr.
Mappin. I'll get my wife to relieve me here. Am I to come to the
front door or the service entrance, sir?"</p>

<p>"The front door," said Lee. "Take a taxi."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch25" name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">THE three men taxied over to the East River. The
theatres were not yet out and they made good time. Driving
through the streets they could hear newsboys calling extras with
the latest news of the attack on Cynthia Dordress and the search
for the man in the yellow overcoat. Lee, thoughtfully rolling an
unlighted cigar between his lips, stared out of the window the
whole way without seeing anything.</p>

<p>When the cab drew up in front of his house he glanced at his
two companions. "You boys had better come up with me. I may need
you."</p>

<p>They entered the house. There was another Headquarters man
waiting in the lobby. The two detectives passed each other
without any sign of recognition. Upstairs, when Jermyn opened the
door, Lee heard a murmur of men's voices in the distant living-room
and his face hardened. "Who's here?" he whispered. "Mr.
Townley, Mr. Gundy and Mr. Ackroyd."</p>

<p>Lee's eyebrows went up. "I told you not to let anybody in the
apartment!"</p>

<p>"But your intimate friends, sir," protested Jermyn. "They said
they'd wait until you returned. I didn't like to take it on
myself to..."</p>

<p>Lee smoothed his ruffled feathers. "All right...Have they seen
Miss Cynthia?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I told them she was indisposed. The young ladies are
together in the guest-room."</p>

<p>"Did the men come together or singly?"</p>

<p>"Singly, sir. Mr. Townley came first."</p>

<p>"Put this typewriter out of sight under your bed. Take these
two gentlemen through the kitchen into your room. Feed them, if
they're hungry, and give them a drink. Keep your voices down. I
don't want anybody to know they're here."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The three men disappeared silently through the pantry door;
Lee proceeded through the long gallery. His vast square living-room
was lined on two sides with windows looking East over the
river and South over the town. Siebert Ackroyd had opened a
french window on the balcony above the river, and was standing in
the opening, looking out; Emmett Gundy, seated on a sofa, was
turning the pages of a magazine; Mack Townley paced nervously
back and forth with his hands behind him. The first unbidden
thought that flitted through Lee's mind was: Fine, upstanding
men, all three of them&mdash;but...!"</p>

<p>"Lee!" they cried out together, all starting for him. Siebert
with long strides reached him first. All three talked at
once.</p>

<p>"Is she hurt. Lee? O God, when I read that terrible story I
had to come!"</p>

<p>"Me, too! What a dastardly attack! Fortunately I was able to
keep the news of it from Bea or she would never have been able to
go on to-night."</p>

<p>"Have they caught the brute. Lee? The police are so dumb!"</p>

<p>Lee waved his hands. "One at a time!...Cynthia is not injured
except for a bruise or two. But she has had a nasty shock. The
man has not been caught, but the police have hopes."</p>

<p>"Could I see her?" pleaded Emmett. "I know it's a lot to ask.
But if I could see her only for a moment."</p>

<p>Siebert glared at him angrily, and Emmett turned his back on
him. The mere presence of Siebert in the same room always made
the carefully-arranged Emmett look his age. Emmett knew it, and
it made him vicious. He glanced in a convenient mirror and
stroked his moustache. That, at least, looked young. "I expect
she's gone to bed," Lee said mildly. "But I'll find out. You boys
will have to excuse me for a few moments. A cable has come that I
must decode." Lee went to the bookshelves and abstracted a thin
volume, much worn. "My code book," he said pleasantly. He took
care to conceal the cover of the book under his arm as he went
out.</p>

<p>Crossing the gallery, he opened the door to the corridor,
which served the bedroom wing of the apartment. He knocked at the
end door and Fanny opened it. She smiled, and opening the door
wider, showed him Cynthia in the bed. Her long curved lashes lay
on her pale cheeks; all the wear and tear of the day was wiped
out of her face; her breast was gently rising and falling. Lee
nodded in satisfaction and was turning away when she awoke.
"Lee!" she said. "Thank God! you're home. I was so worried."</p>

<p>Lee had no intention of relating his escape. "Nonsense!" he
said. "I was guarded on every side by big strong detectives...How
do you feel?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Siebert and Mack and Emmett have come to ask for you. Do you
want to see them?"</p>

<p>"Siebert!" she cried, with all her heart in her
voice&mdash;then quickly shook her head. "No, I don't want to see
anybody," she said sullenly.</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear. Finish out your sleep."</p>

<p>Lee entered a little study that adjoined his bedroom, and
seating himself at the desk, switched on a lamp. The book under
his arm was a manual of the language of the ancient Phoenicians.
Opening it at the page illustrating the Phoenician alphabet, he
laid the leaf from Gavin Dordress' note-book beside it, and
started to translate it on another sheet. The first words gave
him a clue to the whole. His jaw dropped, he stared incredulously
at the page, then went on putting down the modern characters
rapidly.</p>

<p>Alone in his own room with the door shut, he had no need of
putting a guard on his face. Amazement, horror and a grim
satisfaction succeeded each other there. He finished the last
letter with a stab of his pencil, and seizing original and
translation, jumped up and, slipping them in his pocket, started
back for the living-room. At the door of the study a new thought
came to him. Turning in the other direction, he knocked again on
Cynthia's door. His face was as expressionless as wood then.
Cynthia was awake; the two girls were talking quietly. Lee when
it suited him could lie as smoothly as any man in Christendom.
When Fanny opened the door, he said: "I've just had a telephone
message. The man has been caught."</p>

<p>Cynthia's face flushed very pink and paled again. "Thank God!"
she said. "Then he can do no further harm."</p>

<p>Fanny, studying Lee, said nothing. She knew her employer
better than Cynthia did. "If I have him brought here," said Lee,
"do you feel able to face him for the purpose of
identification?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," Cynthia said quickly. "I'm all right. I want
to do my part. I'll get dressed at once."</p>

<p>"No need of that," said Lee. "Dressing-gown and slippers will
do. You will only be wanted for a moment. I'll let you know."</p>

<p>As he was leaving them he heard the bell ring and when he got
out into the corridor, Jermyn was at the door. The visitor was
not Hillman nor Loasby, whom Lee expected, but a veiled woman. He
saw Jermyn start back. The woman, catching sight of Lee, pushed
past the servant throwing her veil back. It was Gail Garrett. So
broken was she, so haggard, so careless in her dress, that Lee
did not recognise her until she had almost reached him. She
appeared to be almost beside herself. "Lee! That ghastly story in
the papers. How is the girl? I could not rest until I had found
out." The once glorious voice had a raucous edge on it; her
utterance was slurred as if she had been drinking or was under
the influence of a drug. Lee looked at her in grim pity.
"Cynthia's all right," he said. He stepped to the door of the
living-room and closed it.</p>

<p>Gail clapped her hands to her head. "O, God, Lee! do you think
I hired that brute to kill Gavin, and then attack the girl? I
cannot bear my life! I cannot bear it!"</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Once I may have had that possibility in
mind. I know better now." She dropped in a chair against the wall
of the gallery and drew the back of her hand across the forehead,
staring. Her moods were as changeable as water. "What does it
matter?" she said, in a dead voice. "I'm done for. I don't know
why I came here."</p>

<p>Lee's thoughts went back to the dazzling Gail Garrett bowing
and smiling on the stage in response to a roar of applause.</p>

<p>Her voice became urgent again. "Lee let me see the girl for a
moment. Just a little moment. Let me go down on my knees and beg
her to forgive me. She couldn't refuse! She's a woman, too. She
has a heart. Oh God, Lee, I loved him so! I can't bear my life!
Let me see the girl."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "It wouldn't do any good. You must
remember she knows you plotted to kill her father. That's not
easy to forgive. Better leave it to time."</p>

<p>Gail got to her feet unsteadily. "O well, it doesn't matter.
I'm done for. I've got no friends."</p>

<p>"I'll look you up when I get this business out of the way,"
said Lee. "Something can be done."</p>

<p>She was on her way to the door. "Don't bother," she said.</p>

<p>The bell rang again, and Jermyn was opening the door. This was
Hillman, the ex-butler. At sight of him Gail cried out sharply:
"What are you doing here? Are you following me? Is this a
trap?"</p>

<p>The gaunt Hillman, terrified at the sight of her, turned as if
to run, but Jermyn was at the door behind him, blocking the way.
"No, no. Miss," he stammered. "I didn't expect to find you
here."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Gail recklessly. "My money's all gone.
You can't get another cent out of me. So publish and be
damned!"</p>

<p>"No, Miss, no!" protested Hillman.</p>

<p>Lee, sharply interested, came forward. "Publish what?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"My letters. Last year I wrote some indiscreet letters to
Gavin. He tore them up and threw them in his waste-basket. This
worm recovered the pieces and putting them together, started
blackmailing me by threatening to sell the letters to a tabloid.
When he got the notion of starting a restaurant I had to pay him
thousands."</p>

<p>"So that's why you paid!" murmured Lee. "Well, I'll be damned.
It had nothing to do with Gavin's death!"</p>

<p>"No! This was before," said Gail impatiently. She turned on
Hillman again. "Go ahead and sell the letters. You can't do me
any further harm."</p>

<p>"No," whined Hillman. "I want you to have the letters. I been
twice to your hotel to give them to you, but they wouldn't let me
see you. I didn't dare trust them to a servant. Here, Miss,
here!" He was offering her a little packet wrapped in paper.</p>

<p>Gail stared at him uncertainly, took the packet; opened one
end of it; pulled out a letter; counted the rest, and thrust the
packet in her handbag. "It's too late," she muttered. "These
can't help me."</p>

<p>Lee was angry. "Well, by God! that restaurant is rightfully
yours," he said.</p>

<p>Hillman faced him in terror. "No! No! Mr. Mappin," he cried,
"if you take it from me it will be no good to nobody! I'll pay!
I'll pay her every cent I got off her. I'll pay a hundred a week,
maybe more later."</p>

<p>Gail cursed him indifferently. "What's a hundred a week to me,
you worm!"</p>

<p>"Take it!" Lee urged her. "Go to a sanatorium and recover your
health; make a come-back on the stage. You have plenty of
friends; you are not forgotten."</p>

<p>Gail shrugged indifferently. "It's not worth the trouble. Life
is too tedious to endure!"</p>

<p>She went on to the door, and Jermyn let her out. "Just the
same I'll hold you to that promise," Lee said sternly to Hillman.
"A hundred dollars a week to Miss Garrett. The first week you
default you'll be clapped in jail."</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Mappin, I will never default!" vowed Hillman. "I want
to do the right thing. Mr. Mappin, I went into this business very
unwillingly. Nobody knows how I suffered while it was going
on."</p>

<p>"You took the money."</p>

<p>"I'm not a bad man, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"There might be two opinions about that."</p>

<p>"It was my wife forced me to do it. She's ambitious."</p>

<p>"You can go," said Lee.</p>

<p>Hillman did not immediately obey. "Mr. Mappin, was it for this
reason that you sent for me?"</p>

<p>"No. I knew nothing about your blackmailing operations until
now."</p>

<p>"Why did you want to see me, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Lee grimly, "I had a notion to try an overcoat on
you, but I've learned since I phoned you that it doesn't
fit."</p>

<p>He went on into the living-room. Hillman looked after him full
of suspicion and fear. "Now then, look sharp!" said Jermyn at the
door. Hillman slunk through it with his head over his shoulder,
expecting a kick. "I wouldn't soil my shoes," said Jermyn.</p>

<p>Lee entered the living-room with a wooden face. "Sorry to keep
you boys waiting," he said; "I had a visitor."</p>

<p>"That's all right," they murmured variously.</p>

<p>"Cynthia had gone to bed. But she said she'd come in for a
minute. You'd better wait."</p>

<p>"That's splendid!" said Emmett. "Bea will feel better if I can
take her a first-hand report," said Mack.</p>

<p>Siebert said nothing.</p>

<p>Lee glanced covertly in the faces of his three "friends" when
they weren't looking. It was impossible to tell anything about
them. Men learn very early to hide their feelings; some from
babyhood. A man's best friends are strange to him. I never had
but one real friend, thought Lee; well, that was a lot. In order
to fill in the strained silence he heard himself saying: "The
market was a little off at the close."</p>

<p>They all stared. Mack said bluntly: "Have you gone nuts,
Lee?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised," said Lee. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Who the devil cares about Wall Street at such a moment?"</p>

<p>"One must say something."</p>

<p>Lee was deeply excited. He surreptitiously wiped his face. His
ears were stretched for the sound of the doorbell. He kept
glancing at his watch. Why the hell didn't Loasby come? No one
could have guessed from his mild face that he was churning
inside.</p>

<p>Emmett, to fill another uncomfortable pause, asked Mack how
business was at the theatre. "Couldn't be better," growled Mack.
"Fifty or more standees nightly. At every matinee we turn
hundreds away."</p>

<p>"It's the title that attracts the women," said Emmett.</p>

<p>At last the sound of the doorbell. Lee stood up. He heard the
rumble of Loasby's deep voice in the gallery, and presently the
Inspector entered, carrying the old scuffed gladstone bag. Lee
introduced him. "This is Inspector Loasby, gentlemen. Mr. Gundy,
Mr. Ackroyd&mdash;Mack Townley you know."</p>

<p>Hands were shaken all around. Lee watched the faces. "By God!"
said Mack, "is that the bag the fellow left in the lavatory?
Let's see what's in it, Inspector."</p>

<p>The bag was opened out flat on a table and the shapeless
yellow overcoat taken out and exhibited; the curious leather
helmet, the rumpled suit; broken shoes, spectacles. There was a
small tin make-up box with sticks of grease-paint, cold cream,
etc. Lee, glancing in the faces bending over these things, could
see nothing showing there but simple curiosity. He said: "Notice
how cleverly the shoulders and back of the overcoat have been
padded to alter the wearer's figure."</p>

<p>"Then he wasn't such a big fellow after all," said Mack.</p>

<p>"Tall," remarked Lee. "One of you fellows try it on."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I will!" said Siebert.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's lousy," said Mack, drawing back.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing!" said Emmett.</p>

<p>Lee looked Emmett up and down speculatively. "Seems as if it
was about your size. Try it on."</p>

<p>"No. Put it on yourself."</p>

<p>"I'm too little," said Lee. He glanced at Loasby.</p>

<p>"Put it on, Mr. Gundy," barked the Inspector in his official
voice.</p>

<p>Emmett's face turned greenish. "Well, if you insist," he said
with a ghastly grin. He wriggled into the overcoat, and Lee noted
how snugly the padding fitted over his shoulders and back. They
pulled the leather helmet over his head. The thick glasses
changed his whole expression.</p>

<p>"This dirty-looking grease-paint was to make his face
cadaverous," said Lee. He started rubbing it into Emmett's
cheeks. "Brown for an unshaven chin. I can't take the time to
make a perfect job of this, but it will give you an idea."</p>

<p>"Don't mind me," said Emmett, bringing out a laugh. "Always
glad to afford amusement to my friends."</p>

<p>Lee noted that he was breathing as quick as a wounded animal;
and saw how the sweat oozed through the grease-paint on his face.
Emmett was grinning like a man on the rack. Lee unobtrusively
pressed a button in the wall. Returning, he added a few finishing
touches to his work. "What have I got to do?" asked Emmett,
laughing. "Act in a charade?" Nobody answered him.</p>

<p>When Lee heard Jermyn coming in the gallery he went to meet
him at the door of the room and told him in a low tone to ask
Miss Cynthia to come in. Afterwards he was to fetch out the two
men from his room and let them wait in the gallery until wanted.
"Now can I take off this rig?" asked Emmett.</p>

<p>"In a minute," said Lee.</p>

<p>Cynthia came in quickly, followed by Fanny. Cynthia was
wearing a blue cashmere negligee of Fanny's trimmed with
swansdown, which gave her an ethereal appearance. Every man in
the room caught his breath at the sight of her. Having been
warned, she was not startled at the sight of the man in the
yellow overcoat. She looked him up and down gravely. Emmett
turned rigid at the sight of her. His hand stole to his throat.
He seemed to be trying to speak, and could not. "Is this the man
who attacked you this evening?" asked Loasby.</p>

<p>"I think so," she said doubtfully. "There is something
different about him...No, Inspector, this man has a moustache and
that other had a shaven lip."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Lee, "I forgot that." He turned to Emmett.
The latter threw an arm over his mouth, but Loasby pulled down
both his arms from behind and held them. The trim little
moustache came away in Lee's hand with a couple of pulls. "It's
false," he said. "In disguising himself he reversed the usual
procedure. Rather clever of him."</p>

<p>"That is the man," said Cynthia. "I am certain of it now."</p>

<p>Fanny slipped an arm through Cynthia's and the two girls went
out.</p>

<p>"I can produce a dozen more identifying witnesses," murmured
Lee.</p>

<p>There was a silence in the big room. Siebert and Mack were
staring at Emmett, dazed. Loasby was the first to speak. He said,
with a curious mixture of admiration and chagrin: "Nice work.
Lee. Like the Mounties, you always get your man."</p>

<p>Lee, with a look of pain, threw up his hand. "This was more
than just another case, Inspector."</p>

<p>No sound came from Emmett. Loasby had released his arms.
Suddenly with the quickness of an animal, he sprang for the open
window. The river was two hundred feet below. Loasby grabbed him,
but he slipped through. Siebert thrust out a foot and he crashed
to the ground. They seized him. He struggled silently, like a
madman, with the strength of three. Loasby drew his gun and,
reversing it, struck him on the head with the butt. Emmett went
limp. Smither and the headquarters detective ran in. "Have you
got handcuffs?" Loasby asked his man. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Put them on him, and carry him out into the gallery. Phone
down to the lobby for Williamson to come up. Get a car to take
this fellow to Headquarters."</p>

<p>Again there was a silence in the big room. The men looked at
each other, unable to comprehend that it was all over. Siebert
murmured: "Gavin was Emmett's friend for twenty-five years!"
After a moment, he added: "I can't seem to get it straight. Lee.
What about the play?"</p>

<p>"It was Gavin's play. That's what Emmett killed him for.
Emmett copied it, making a few unimportant changes, and sent it
to you under the name of John Venner."</p>

<p>"Good God, Lee! Do you blame me for my part in marketing
it?"</p>

<p>"Did you know it was Gavin's play?"</p>

<p>"No! I'm not a literary man, I'm an agent!"</p>

<p>"That lets you out." Lee looked at Mack sombrely.</p>

<p>"Mack knew it."</p>

<p>Mack's face turned livid. "No, Lee!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Don't lie," said Lee deprecatingly. "I have proof that you
knew."</p>

<p>"How could I have known it? I only surmised it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me before you put it into rehearsal?"</p>

<p>"That wouldn't have brought Gavin back."</p>

<p>"It would have saved me two months' work, and Cynthia all that
mental agony...Suppose this brute had killed her this
evening?"</p>

<p>Mack flung an arm up. "For God's sake, don't speak of that,
Lee!...Try to put yourself in my place," he went on. "This play
gave me my only chance to effect a reconciliation with Bea. She
was mad to nose out the Garrett woman and play that part."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Lee, "and what was friendship?"</p>

<p>Mack was silent. "Lee," asked Loasby, "how did you pin it on
Emmett Gundy?"</p>

<p>"We traced him by the old typewriter. To-night we found the
hangout where he did his typing. In a hole in the wall I found a
page from Gavin's note-book which Emmett had saved because he
couldn't read it, and he thought it must be important. It was
important. It'll send him to the chair." Lee took the leaf from
his pocket and passed it over.</p>

<p>"This is all in hieroglyphics," said Loasby.</p>

<p>"Phoenician characters," corrected Lee. "When we were in
school together Gavin and I used to correspond in these
characters in order to conceal our boyish secrets. There are only
nineteen letters in the Phoenician alphabet and when we lacked a
letter we turned one of our own upside down. Gavin had occasion
to make an entry in his note-book that he didn't want anybody to
read and he naturally turned to these characters again."</p>

<p>"What does it say?" asked Loasby.</p>

<p>"Listen." Lee read slowly: "For his new novel Emmett said he
needed a farewell letter left by a successful man who had
suddenly tired of life. He couldn't seem to get it right, and I
wrote out a draft for him. Afterwards the amusing thought came to
me: Suppose E were to kill me and leave this letter beside my
body? There's an idea for a crime play in this."</p>

<p>"Good God!" murmured Siebert.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch26" name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">THE police took away their prisoner. Mack
Townley slipped out of the apartment without saying anything to
Lee; he was ashamed. Lee paid off Smither and sent him home. Only
Siebert was left with Lee. The tall young fellow drifted back and
forth in the big room, aimlessly picking things up and putting
them down again; glancing at Lee out of the corners of his eyes,
evidently longing to confide in him, and afraid to speak. To Lee
he seemed absurdly young. Finally he said very off-hand: "I
suppose Cynthia's gone back to bed."</p>

<p>"I reckon so," said Lee. "She's probably asleep."</p>

<p>"Well, hardly sleeping so soon after the scene in this
room."</p>

<p>Another silence. In the end Siebert could no longer hold
himself in. "O God, Lee," he burst out, "I love her so much it's
terrible! Will I ever be able to make good with her? Has the
break between us widened so far it can never be bridged?"</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Lee. "How can I tell? I don't know what has
passed between you."</p>

<p>"I acted terribly," said Siebert. "I could bite my tongue off
when I think of some of the things I said. It was only because I
loved her so, but she can't understand that...God! I've tried my
damnedest to forget her. Night after night I've tried to drink
myself into unconsciousness. I've tried to get interested in
other women. It's no good! no good! I only come out of it
disgusted with myself, and wanting her more than ever."</p>

<p>"She's proud," said Lee. "You'll have to humble yourself
before she'll forgive you."</p>

<p>"Humble myself! To Cynthia! God! I'd push a peanut with my
nose from the Battery to Harlem for her!"</p>

<p>"I doubt if that would help."</p>

<p>"I have too violent a nature," Siebert said sorrowfully. "But
I'll change. I'll learn to control myself!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't tame myself too much," said Lee. "Of course, I
don't know anything about it myself, but I'm told they don't
really mind a little violence."</p>

<p>"Ah, now you're only pulling my leg!"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Another silence. "Of course, even if she's awake, it would be
a mistake to say anything to her to-night," Siebert said, begging
Lee with his eyes to contradict him.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Yet she might think it strange if I went home without even
sending her message."</p>

<p>"You can send your love by me."</p>

<p>"O God, Lee, don't torment me!"</p>

<p>"Well, if I could trust you merely to say goodnight..."</p>

<p>Siebert was electrified with joy. "But if she's in bed!" he
gasped.</p>

<p>"Fanny's in there."</p>

<p>"Can I? Can I?"</p>

<p>"If you will promise me not to make a scene, however she may
provoke you."</p>

<p>"God, Lee, I'll go in on tiptoe!"</p>

<p>He was already making for the gallery with four-foot strides;
Lee trotted after him and opened the door to the bedroom
corridor. "The last door," he said.</p>

<p>Siebert knocked. When Fanny opened the door he said
breathlessly: "Just wanted to say good-night to Cynthia." Fanny,
smiling, opened the door wide, and there she lay. "Cynthia!" he
murmured, forgetting everything. "I'm in bed!" she said
indignantly. "I see you are," he murmured, confused. "Go
away!"</p>

<p>"All right, Cyn." But he did not go. Fanny started edging out
of the room behind him. "Stay here, Fanny!" commanded Cynthia.
Fanny made believe to be deaf. "Well...good-night," said Siebert.
"Good-night," said Cynthia crossly. Siebert, like a man in a
trance, went half-way to the bed. "I'm so sorry, Cyn," he
murmured. "You can tell me some other time." He went all the way
to the bed then, and dropped to his knees beside it. "I love you
so much!" he whispered, not daring to touch her.</p>

<p>It was sweet to see so big a young man so chastened, and in
spite of herself a dimple appeared in Cynthia's cheek. She looked
obstinately away towards the window. "Can't you forgive me?" he
whispered. "Give me a little time."</p>

<p>"At least you know now that there is no guilt on me."</p>

<p>"I never really believed you were guilty."</p>

<p>"You said you did. After all, I've got something to forgive,
too."</p>

<p>Cynthia jerked her head around. "That's not going to do you
any good!"</p>

<p>"I've got to be honest with you," he pleaded. "I love you too
much to flatter you."</p>

<p>"What have you got to forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Because you allowed yourself to believe even for a moment
that I could be guilty of such a thing!"</p>

<p>"Well, you acted like it!"</p>

<p>"You should have known!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to lie here and be scolded by you. Go
away."</p>

<p>"Please don't anger me," he begged. "I promised Lee
that..."</p>

<p>"Go away! Go away! Go away!"</p>

<p>Siebert's self-imposed discipline broke down. "All right!" he
cried in a rage. "But by God! I'm going to have a kiss
first!"</p>

<p>He flung his arms around her. It turned out to be a long kiss.
Cynthia relaxed and her white arms stole around his neck. "I love
you so much!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"I suppose I love you, too," she grumbled. "But, Lord! you're
going to be difficult to manage!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch27" name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII.</a> </h2>

<p class="first">AFTER his arrest Emmett Gundy appeared to turn
completely apathetic, but those who visited him reported that
there was a wicked fire hidden in the man. He said he had no
money to employ a lawyer, and he rejected all offers to supply
him with one. Lee would have been glad to contribute to such a
cause, merely for the sake of seeing justice done. A famous
alienist interested himself in the case, but Emmett would not
submit to an examination. In the end the court assigned one of
the thousand-dollar men to defend him. This lawyer could get
nothing out of his client. Emmett insisted on pleading guilty,
and no doubt the lawyer encouraged it because it saved him
trouble. In any case, the evidence for the prosecution was
overwhelming.</p>

<p>When it was all over it transpired that Emmett had left a
confession. It was a strange document. Instead of expressing
sorrow for his acts, he appeared to glory in them.</p> <br>

<p class="letter">"I had had it in for Gavin Dordress for a long
time." (he wrote) "Every time he gave me money I hated him,
because I should have been the one to give money to him. He had
everything in the world; fame, money, lovers, friends, and I had
nothing. It wasn't fair, because when we were young men together
everybody said I had more talent than he. But he was crafty; he
had the art of getting what he wanted out of people. Everybody
fell for him. I wasn't liked because I was too honest. He had no
real talent; his plays weren't any good, but he was a past master
of publicity. He milked other men's brains; some of his best
ideas he stole from me. My novels were so good, the publishers
were afraid of them. There was a conspiracy to keep me down.</p>

<p class="letter">"It was his secretiveness that gave me the idea
of rubbing him out. He would never tell anybody what he was
writing. As soon as I made sure of this, I began to lay my plans
to get his play. Sitting in his studio one day, looking out of
the window, I saw how easy it would be to come down from the roof
of the building next door. Every time I went into the sunroom I
saw the key to the garden door hanging there, and I knew that
nobody went out in the garden after summer was over. So one day I
prigged the key and had a duplicate made. Afterwards I returned
the original key to its place without its ever having been
missed. I got the suicide letter out of him a couple of weeks
before I was ready to use it.</p>

<p class="letter">"I spent a lot of thought and time on my
disguise. As I would have to pass through the next building,
firstly to get the lay of the land, and secondly to pull the
trick, I had to make myself look completely different from my
usual self. At first I couldn't see through the thick glasses I
put on, but I trained myself so that I could look around them. I
shaved off my moustache and practised with false hair until I
could apply one exactly like it. Thus I was able to go clean
shaven when disguised.</p>

<p class="letter">"My opportunity came on the night Gavin gave a
dinner party. I left the party early, changed to my disguise in
the Penn Station, and got to the roof of the building next door.
I lowered myself to Gavin's roof garden by means of a thin,
strong rope ladder I had made. I could see into the penthouse
through the windows. His man was still there and I waited.
Meanwhile I took off my disguise. I had on a black overcoat under
the yellow one and a hat in the pocket, and I fixed up to look
like my ordinary self as well as I could in the dark.</p>

<p class="letter">"As soon as Gavin was alone I let myself into
the sunroom, crossed the lobby and went out into the elevator
hall without his hearing me. I had a little mirror, and in the
hall I fixed my moustache. All these details were planned in
advance. I rang the apartment bell. Gavin came to the door. He
was surprised to see me back. I told him I was so nervous I
couldn't sleep; I wanted somebody to talk to. He couldn't very
well turn me away. He took me in the studio and offered me a
drink. While he was away getting ice I put a glove on, and got
his gun out of the desk drawer and dropped it in my pocket. I
kept my gloved hand out of sight. He suggested a game of chess to
quiet my nerves. This suited me all right. While he was sitting
in his chair arranging the men on a little tabourette in front of
him, I came up at one side and shot him.</p>

<p class="letter">"I took my time to fix everything. In a drawer
of his desk I found the script of an old play. The fire was about
out. I burned the script page by page to make sure it was
completely destroyed, and then laid the half-burned title page of
The Changeling on the hearth. I strapped the rest of The
Changeling script around my waist. I put away the chessmen and
moved the tabourette. I laid the farewell letter on his desk,
left the lights burning, and got out. Resumed my disguise in the
garden; climbed the rope ladder and pulled it up after me; tied
it around me under the overcoat. I had a little difficulty
getting out of the building next door, because it was closed up
for the night, but by listening carefully, I could keep tab of
the watchman on his rounds, and I finally made my way down to the
ground floor and let myself out into the street.</p>

<p class="letter">"Amos Lee Mappin, being an intimate friend of
Gavin's, was the greatest danger I ran, but I had to chance it.
Mappin is a slippery customer, and a criminal at heart. He always
had it in for me. The police were satisfied as to suicide; they
never figured in the case until the end. Only Mappin insisted
that it was murder; he saw good publicity in it for himself. I
made Louella Kip swear to an alibi for me that night. She never
knew that I had put Gavin out. She just thought she was saving me
inconvenience.</p>

<p class="letter">"When I read that Mappin had found a little
bruise on Gavin's forehead and had sketched it, I was worried. I
knew Gavin must have got it from striking against one of the
chessmen, and I expected Mappin would find the chessmen next. I
thought there might be a speck of blood or skin on one of them.
So I assumed my disguise and returned to the penthouse that
night. When I got down to the roof of the lower building, I found
to my surprise that Mappin and the girl were staying in the
apartment, but that didn't frighten me off. I waited until they
went to bed, and let myself in and replaced the chessmen with a
different set. On the way out the girl saw me in the dark and
screamed, but luck was with me. She fainted, and while Mappin was
bringing her to, I made a getaway.</p>

<p class="letter">"The rest is pretty well known. Everything went
wrong after the play was produced. The girl made believe to
recognise the play as Gavin's work. She couldn't have known it
was his play; it was only a notion that she insisted on. And
Mappin backed her up, of course. So I was unable to cash in on
any royalties. I had to give up my room at the Vandermeer. In the
first place, if Gavin's death had been accepted as a suicide, I
had intended to come out after a bit and acknowledge the play as
mine. Then I could have lived easy for the rest of my life. But
Mappin spoiled all that. It was only by a fluke that he caught me
in the end. My plans were perfect. But I was too daring in going
to his apartment that night.</p>
