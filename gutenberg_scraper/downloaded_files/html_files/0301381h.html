<p> </p>

<p>A London dining-club is a curious organism, for it combines
great tenacity of life with a chameleon-like tendency to change
its colour. A club which begins as a haunt of roysterers may end
as a blameless academic fraternity; another, which at the start
is a meeting-place of the intelligent, becomes in the progress of
time a select coterie of sportsmen. So it has been with the
institution of which I am the chronicler. It has changed its name
and is now the Thursday Club, and the number of permissible
members has been increased. Its dinners are admirable;
conversation at its board is dignified and a little serious; it
has enlarged its interests, and would not now refuse a Lord
Chancellor or a Bishop.</p>

<p>But in its infancy it was different. Founded just after the
close of the War by a few people who had been leading queer lives
and wanted to keep together, it was a gathering of youngish men
who met only for reminiscences and relaxation. It was officially
limited to fifteen members--fifteen, because a dozen was dull,
thirteen was unlucky, and fourteen had in those days an
unpleasing flavour of President Wilson and his points. At first,
until Burminster took it in hand, the food and wine were
execrable; hence the name of the Runagates Club, given it by
Lamancha from the verse in the 68th Psalm: "He letteth the
runagates continue in scarceness."</p>

<p>But all defects in the fare were atoned for by the talk,
which, like that of Praed's Vicar,</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"slipped from politics to puns,</i><br>
 <i>And passed from Mahomet to Moses."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>You could never tell what topic would engage the company, and
no topic was left unadorned, for I do not suppose there has ever
been a group with such varied experiences and attainments. Each
man was in his own way an expert, but, while knowledge might be
specialised, the life of each had been preposterously varied. The
War had flattened out grooves and set every man adventuring. So
the lawyer and the financier were also soldiers; the Greek
scholar had captained a Bedawin tribe; the traveller had dabbled
in secret service; the journalist had commanded a battalion; the
historian had been mate on a novel kind of tramp; the
ornithologist had watched more perilous things than birds; the
politician had handled a rougher humanity than an English
electorate. Some of the members, like Lord Lamancha, Sir Edward
Leithen and Sir Arthur Warcliff, were familiar to the public;
others were known only to narrow circles; but at the Runagates
Club they were of one family and totem, like old
schoolfellows.</p>

<p>Good talk is not for reproduction in cold print. But at those
early dinners there were reminiscences which may well be rescued
from oblivion, for all were story-tellers on occasion. Indeed, it
became the fashion once a month for a member to entertain the
company with a more or less complete narrative. From these I have
made a selection which I now set forth.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne: <i>Religio Medici.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>We were talking about the persistence of race qualities--how
you might bury a strain for generations under fresh graftings but
the aboriginal sap would some day stir. The obvious instance was
the Jew, and Pugh had also something to say about the surprises
of a tincture of hill blood in the Behari. Peckwether, the
historian, was inclined to doubt. The old stock, he held, could
disappear absolutely as if by a chemical change, and the end be
as remote from the beginnings as--to use his phrase--a ripe
Gorgonzola from a bucket of new milk.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you're ever quite safe," said Sandy
Arbuthnot.</p>

<p>"You mean that an eminent banker may get up one morning with a
strong wish to cut himself shaving in honour of Baal?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. But the tradition is more likely to be negative. There
are some things that for no particular reason he won't like, some
things that specially frighten him. Take my own case. I haven't a
scrap of real superstition in me, but I hate crossing a river at
night. I fancy a lot of my blackguard ancestors got scuppered at
moonlight fords. I believe we're all stuffed full of atavistic
fears, and you can't tell how or when a man will crack till you
know his breeding."</p>

<p>"I think that's about the truth of it," said Hannay, and after
the discussion had rambled on for a while he told us this
tale.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Just after the Boer War (he said) I was on a prospecting job
in the north-eastern Transvaal. I was a mining engineer, with
copper as my speciality, and I had always a notion that copper
might be found in big quantities in the Zoutpansberg foothills.
There was of course Messina at the west end, but my thoughts
turned rather to the north-east corner, where the berg breaks
down to the crook of the Limpopo. I was a young man then, fresh
from two years' campaigning with the Imperial Light Horse, and I
was thirsty for better jobs than trying to drive elusive burghers
up against barbed wire and blockhouses. When I started out with
my mules from Pietersburg on the dusty road to the hills, I think
I felt happier than ever before in my life.</p>

<p>I had only one white companion, a boy of twenty-two called
Andrew Du Preez. Andrew, not Andries, for he was named after the
Reverend Andrew Murray, who had been a great Pope among the
devout Afrikanders. He came of a rich Free State farming family,
but his particular branch had been settled for two generations in
the Wakkerstroom region along the upper Pongola. The father was a
splendid old fellow with a head like Moses, and he and all the
uncles had been on commando, and most of them had had a spell in
Bermuda or Ceylon. The boy was a bit of a freak in that stock. He
had been precociously intelligent, and had gone to a good school
in the Cape and afterwards to a technical college in
Johannesburg. He was as modern a product as the others were
survivals, with none of the family religion or family politics,
very keen on science, determined to push his way on the
Rand--which was the Mecca of all enterprising Afrikanders--and
not very sorry that the War should have found him in a place from
which it was manifestly impossible to join the family banner. In
October '99 he was on his first job in a new mining area in
Rhodesia, and as he hadn't much health he was wise enough to
stick there till peace came.</p>

<p>I had known him before, and when I ran across him on the Rand
I asked him to come with me, and he jumped at the offer. He had
just returned from the Wakkerstroom farm, to which the rest of
his clan had been repatriated, and didn't relish the prospect of
living in a tin-roofed shanty with a father who read the Bible
most of the day to find out why exactly he had merited such
misfortunes. Andrew was a hard young sceptic, in whom the family
piety produced acute exasperation. . . . He was a good-looking
boy, always rather smartly dressed, and at first sight you would
have taken him for a young American, because of his heavy
hairless chin, his dull complexion, and the way he peppered his
ordinary speech with technical and business phrases. There was a
touch of the Mongol in his face, which was broad, with high cheek
bones, eyes slightly slanted, short thick nose and rather full
lips. I remembered that I had seen the same thing before in young
Boers, and I thought I knew the reason. The Du Preez family had
lived for generations close up to the Kaffir borders, and
somewhere had got a dash of the tar-brush.</p>

<p>We had a light wagon with a team of eight mules, and a
Cape-cart drawn by four others; five boys went with us, two of
them Shangaans, and three Basutos from Malietsie's location north
of Pietersburg. Our road was over the Wood Bush, and then
north-east across the two Letabas to the Pufuri river. The
countryside was amazingly empty. Beyer's commandos had skirmished
among the hills, but the war had never reached the plains; at the
same time it had put a stop to all hunting and prospecting and
had scattered most of the native tribes. The place had become in
effect a sanctuary, and I saw more varieties of game than I had
ever seen before south of the Zambesi, so that I wished I were on
a hunting trip instead of on a business job. Lions were
plentiful, and every night we had to build a <i>scherm</i> for
our mules and light great fires, beside which we listened to
their eerie serenades.</p>

<p>It was early December, and in the Wood Bush it was the weather
of an English June. Even in the foothills, among the wormwood and
wild bananas, it was pleasant enough, but when we got out into
the plains it was as hot as Tophet. As far as the eye could reach
the bushveld rolled its scrub like the scrawled foliage a child
draws on a slate, with here and there a baobab swimming
unsteadily in the glare. For long stretches we were away from
water, and ceased to see big game--only Kaffir queens and
tick-birds, and now and then a wild ostrich. Then on the sixth
day out from Pietersburg we raised a blue line of mountains on
the north, which I knew to be the eastern extension of the
Zoutpansberg. I had never travelled this country before, and had
never met a man who had, so we steered by compass, and by one of
the old bad maps of the Transvaal Government. That night we
crossed the Pufuri, and next day the landscape began to change.
The ground rose, so that we had a sight of the distant Lebombo
hills to the east, and mopani bushes began to appear--a sure sign
of a healthier country.</p>

<p>That afternoon we were only a mile or two from the hills. They
were the usual type of berg which you find everywhere from Natal
to the Zambesi--cut sheer, with an overhang in many places, but
much broken up by kloofs and fissures. What puzzled me was the
absence of streams. The ground was as baked as the plains, all
covered with aloe and cactus and thorn, with never a sign of
water. But for my purpose the place looked promising. There was
that unpleasant metallic green that you find in a copper country,
so that everything seemed to have been steeped in a mineral
dye--even the brace of doves which I shot for luncheon.</p>

<p>We turned east along the foot of the cliffs, and presently saw
a curious feature. A promontory ran out from the berg, connected
by a narrow isthmus with the main <i>massif.</i> I suppose the
superficial area of the top might have been a square mile or so;
the little peninsula was deeply cut into by ravines, and in the
ravines tall timber was growing. Also we came to well-grassed
slopes, dotted with mimosa and syringa bushes. This must mean
water at last, for I had never found yellowwoods and stinkwoods
growing far from a stream. Here was our outspan for the night,
and when presently we rounded a corner and looked down into a
green cup I thought I had rarely seen a more habitable place. The
sight of fresh green herbage always intoxicated me, after the
dust and heat and the ugly greys and umbers of the bushveld.
There was a biggish kraal in the bottom, and a lot of goats and
leggy Kaffir sheep on the slopes. Children were bringing in the
cows for the milking, smoke was going up from the cooking fires,
and there was a cheerful evening hum in the air. I expected a
stream, but could see no sign of one: the cup seemed to be as dry
as a hollow of the Sussex Downs. Also, though there were patches
of mealies and Kaffir corn, I could see no irrigated land. But
water must be there, and after we had fixed a spot for our
outspan beside a clump of olivewoods, I took Andrew and one of
our boys and strolled down to make inquiries.</p>

<p>I daresay many of the inhabitants of that kraal had never seen
a white man before, for our arrival made a bit of a sensation. I
noticed that there were very few young men about the place, but
an inordinate number of old women. The first sight of us
scattered them like plovers, and we had to wait for half an hour,
smoking patiently in the evening sun, before we could get into
talk with them. Once the ice was broken, however, things went
well. They were a decent peaceable folk, very shy and scared and
hesitating, but with no guile in them. Our presents of brass and
copper wire and a few tins of preserved meat made a tremendous
impression. We bought a sheep from them at a ridiculously small
price, and they threw in a basket of green mealies. But when we
raised the water question we struck a snag.</p>

<p>There was water, good water, they said, but it was not in any
pan or stream. They got it morning and evening from up there--and
they pointed to the fringe of a wood under the cliffs where I
thought I saw the roof of a biggish <i>rondavel.</i> They got it
from their Father; they were Shangaans, and the word they used
was not the ordinary word for chief, but the name for a great
priest and medicine-man.</p>

<p>I wanted my dinner, so I forbore to inquire further. I
produced some more Kaffir truck, and begged them to present it
with my compliments to their Father, and to ask for water for two
white strangers, five of their own race, and twelve mules. They
seemed to welcome the proposition, and a string of them promptly
set off uphill with their big calabashes. As we walked back I
said something foolish to Andrew about having struck a Kaffir
Moses who could draw water from the rock. The lad was in a bad
temper. "We have struck an infernal rascal who has made a corner
in the water supply and bleeds these poor devils. He's the kind
of grafter I would like to interview with a sjambok."</p>

<p>In an hour we had all the water we wanted. It stood in a row
of calabashes, and beside it the presents I had sent to the
provider. The villagers had deposited it and then vanished, and
our boys who had helped them to carry it were curiously quiet and
solemnised. I was informed that the Father sent the water as a
gift to the strangers without payment. I tried to cross-examine
one of our Shangaans, but he would tell me nothing except that
the water had come from a sacred place into which no man could
penetrate. He also muttered something about a wildebeest which I
couldn't understand. Now the Kaffir is the most superstitious of
God's creatures. All the way from Pietersburg we had been
troubled by the vivid imaginations of our outfit. They wouldn't
sleep in one place because of a woman without a head who haunted
it; they dared not go a yard along a particular road after dark
because of a spook that travelled it in the shape of a rolling
ball of fire. Usually their memories were as short as their
fancies were quick, and five minutes after their protest they
would be laughing like baboons. But that night they seemed to
have been really impressed by something. They did not chatter or
sing over their supper, but gossiped in undertones, and slept as
near Andrew and myself as they dared.</p>

<p>Next morning the same array of gourds stood before our
outspan, and there was enough water for me to have a tub in my
collapsible bath. I don't think I ever felt anything colder.</p>

<p>I had decided to take a holiday and go shooting. Andrew would
stay in camp and tinker up one of the wheels of the mule-wagon
which had suffered from the bush roads. He announced his
intention of taking a walk later and interviewing the
water-merchant.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, be careful," I said. "Most likely he's a
priest of sorts, and if you're not civil to him we'll have to
quit this country. I make a point of respecting the gods of the
heathen."</p>

<p>"All you English do," he replied tartly. "That's why you make
such a damned mess of handling Kaffirs. . . . But this fellow is
a business man with a pretty notion of cornering public
utilities. I'm going to make his acquaintance."</p>

<p>I had a pleasant day in that hot scented wilderness. First I
tried the low ground, but found nothing there but some old spoor
of kudu, and a paauw which I shot. Then I tried the skirts of the
berg to the east of the village, and found that the kloofs, which
from below looked climbable, had all somewhere a confounded
overhang which checked me. I saw no way of getting to the top of
the plateau, so I spent the afternoon in exploring the tumbled
glacis. There was no trace of copper here, for the rock was a
reddish granite, but it was a jolly flowery place, with green
dells among the crags, and an amazing variety of birds. But I was
glad that I had brought a water-bottle, for I found no water; it
was there all right, but it was underground. I stalked a bushbuck
ram and missed him, but I got one of the little buck like chamois
which the Dutch call <i>klipspringer.</i> With it and the paauw
strung round my neck I sauntered back leisurely to supper.</p>

<p>As soon as I came in sight of the village I saw that something
had played the deuce with it. There was a great hubbub going on,
and all the folk were collected at the end farthest away from our
camp. The camp itself looked very silent. I could see the hobbled
mules, but I could see nothing of any of our outfit. I thought it
best in these circumstances to make an inconspicuous arrival, so
I bore away to my left, crossed the hollow lower down where it
was thick with scrub, and came in on the outspan from the south.
It was very silent. The cooking fires had been allowed to go out,
though the boys should have been getting ready the evening meal,
and there seemed to be not a single black face on the premises.
Very uneasy, I made for our sleeping tent, and found Andrew lying
on his bed, smoking.</p>

<p>"What on earth has happened?" I demanded. "Where are Coos and
Klemboy and . . ."</p>

<p>"Quit," he said shortly. "They've all quit."</p>

<p>He looked sulky and tired and rather white in the face, and
there seemed to be more the matter with him than ill temper. He
would lay down his pipe, and press his hand on his forehead like
a man with a bad headache. Also he never lifted his eyes to mine.
I daresay I was a bit harsh, for I was hungry, and there were
moments when I thought he was going to cry. However at last I got
a sort of story out of him.</p>

<p>He had finished his job on the wagon wheel in the morning, and
after luncheon had gone for a walk to the wood above the village
at the foot of the cliffs. He wanted to see where the water came
from and to have a word with the man who controlled it. Andrew,
as I have told you, was a hard young realist and, by way of
reaction from his family, a determined foe of superstition, and
he disliked the notion of this priest and his mumbo-jumbo. Well,
it seemed that he reached the priest's headquarters--it was the
big <i>rondavel</i> we had seen from below, and there was a kind
of stockade stretching on both sides, very strongly fenced, so
that the only entrance was through the <i>rondavel.</i> He had
found the priest at home, and had, according to his account,
spoken to him civilly and had tried to investigate the water
problem. But the old man would have nothing to say to him, and
peremptorily refused his request to be allowed to enter the
enclosure. By and by Andrew lost his temper, and forced his way
in. The priest resisted and there was a scuffle; I daresay Andrew
used his sjambok, for a backveld Dutchman can never keep his
hands off a Kaffir.</p>

<p>I didn't like the story, but it was no use being angry with a
lad who looked like a sick dog.</p>

<p>"What is inside? Did you find the water?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I hadn't time. It's a thick wood and full of beasts. I tell
you I was scared out of my senses and had to run for my
life."</p>

<p>"Leopards?" I asked. I had heard of native chiefs keeping tame
leopards.</p>

<p>"Leopards be damned. I'd have faced leopards. I saw a
wildebeest as big as a house--an old brute, grey in the nozzle
and the rest of it green--green, I tell you. I took a pot shot at
it and ran. . . . When I came out the whole blasted kraal was
howling. The old devil must have roused them. I legged it for
home. . . . No, they didn't follow, but in half an hour all our
outfit had cut their stick . . . didn't wait to pick up their
duds. . . . Oh, hell, I can't talk. Leave me alone."</p>

<p>I had laughed in spite of myself. A wildebeest is not
ornamental at the best, but a green one must be a good recipe for
the horrors. All the same I felt very little like laughing.
Andrew had offended the village and its priest, played havoc with
the brittle nerves of our own boys, and generally made the place
too hot to hold us. He had struck some kind of native magic,
which had frightened him to the bone for all his scepticism. The
best thing I could do seemed to be to try and patch up a peace
with the water merchant. So I made a fire and put on a kettle to
boil, stayed my hunger with a handful of biscuits, and started
out for the <i>rondavel.</i> But first I saw that my revolver was
loaded, for I fancied that there might be trouble. It was a calm
bright evening, but up from the hollow where the kraal lay there
rose a buzz like angry wasps.</p>

<p>No one interfered with me; indeed, I met no one till I
presented myself at the <i>rondavel</i> door. It was a big empty
place, joined to the stockades on both sides, and opposite the
door was another which opened on to a dull green shade. I never
saw a <i>scherm</i> so stoutly built. There was a palisade of
tall pointed poles, and between them a thick wall of wait-a-bit
thorns interlaced with a scarlet-flowered creeper. It would have
taken a man with an axe half a day to cut a road through. The
only feasible entrance was by the <i>rondavel.</i></p>

<p>An old man was squatted on an earthen floor, which had been so
pounded and beaten that it looked like dark polished stone. His
age might have been anything above seventy from the whiteness of
his beard, but there seemed a good deal of bodily strength left
in him, for the long arms which rested on his knees were
muscular. His face was not the squat face of the ordinary Kaffir,
but high-boned and regular, like some types of well-bred Zulu.
Now that I think of it, there was probably Arab blood in him. He
lifted his head at the sound of my steps, and by the way he
looked at me I knew that he was blind.</p>

<p>There he sat without a word, every line of his body full of
dejection and tragedy. I had suddenly a horrible feeling of
sacrilege. That that young fool Andrew should have lifted his
hand upon an old man and a blind man and outraged some harmless
<i>tabu</i> seemed to me an abominable thing. I felt that some
holiness had been violated, something ancient and innocent
cruelly insulted. At that moment there was nothing in the world I
wanted so much as to make restitution.</p>

<p>I spoke to him, using the Shangaan word which means both
priest and king. I told him that I had been away hunting and had
returned to find that my companion had made bad mischief. I said
that Andrew was very young, and that his error had been only the
foolishness and hot-headedness of youth. I said--and my voice
must have shown him that I meant it--that I was cut to the heart
by what had happened, that I bowed my head in the dust in
contrition, and that I asked nothing better than to be allowed to
make atonement. . . . Of course I didn't offer money. I would as
soon have thought of offering a tip to the Pope.</p>

<p>He never lifted his head, so I said it all over again, and the
second time it was genuine pleading. I had never spoken like that
to a Kaffir before, but I could not think of that old figure as a
Kaffir, but as the keeper of some ancient mystery which a rude
hand had outraged.</p>

<p>He spoke at last. "There can be no atonement," he said. "Wrong
has been done, and on the wrong-doer must fall the penalty."</p>

<p>The words were wholly without menace; rather he spoke as if he
were an unwilling prophet of evil. He was there to declare the
law, which he could not alter if he wanted.</p>

<p>I apologised, I protested, I pled, I fairly grovelled; I
implored him to tell me if there was no way in which the trouble
could be mended; but if I had offered him a million pounds I
don't believe that that old fellow would have changed his tone.
He seemed to feel, and he made me feel it too, that a crime had
been committed against the law of nature, and that it was nature,
not man, that would avenge it. He wasn't in the least unfriendly;
indeed, I think he rather liked the serious way I took the
business and realised how sorry I was; his slow sentences came
out without a trace of bitterness. It was this that impressed me
so horribly--he was like an old stone oracle repeating the
commands of the God he served.</p>

<p>I could make nothing of him, though I kept at it till the
shadows had lengthened outside, and it was almost dark within the
<i>rondavel.</i> I wanted to ask him at least to help me to get
back my boys, and to make our peace with the village, but I
simply could not get the words out. The atmosphere was too solemn
to put a practical question like that. . . .</p>

<p>I was turning to go away, when I looked at the door on the far
side. Owing to the curious formation of the cliffs the sinking
sun had only now caught the high tree-tops, and some ricochet of
light made the enclosure brighter than when I first arrived. I
felt suddenly an overwhelming desire to go inside.</p>

<p>"Is it permitted, Father," I said, "to pass through that
door?"</p>

<p>To my surprise he waved me on. "It is permitted," he said,
"for you have a clean heart." Then he added a curious thing.
"What was there is there no more. It has gone to the fulfilling
of the law."</p>

<p>It was with a good deal of trepidation that I entered that
uncanny <i>enceinte.</i> I remembered Andrew's terror, and I kept
my hand on my revolver, for I had a notion that there might be
some queer fauna inside. There was light in the upper air, but
below it was a kind of olive-green dusk. I was afraid of snakes,
also of tiger-cats, and there was Andrew's green wildebeest!</p>

<p>The place was only a couple of acres in extent, and though I
walked very cautiously I soon had made the circuit of it. The
<i>scherm</i> continued in a half-moon on each side till it met
the sheer wall of the cliffs. The undergrowth was not very thick,
and out of it grew tall straight trees, so that the wood seemed
like some old pagan grove. When one looked up the mulberry sunset
sky showed in patches between the feathery tops, but where I
walked it was very dark.</p>

<p>There was not a sign of life in it, not a bird or beast, not
the crack of a twig or a stir in the bushes; all was as quiet and
dead as a crypt. Having made the circuit I struck diagonally
across, and presently came on what I had been looking for--a pool
of water. The spring was nearly circular, with a diameter of
perhaps six yards, and what amazed me was that it was surrounded
by a parapet of hewn stone. In the centre of the grove there was
a little more light, and I could see that that stonework had
never been made by Kaffir hands. Evening is the time when water
comes to its own; it sleeps in the day but it has its own strange
life in the darkness. I dipped my hand in it and it was as cold
as ice. There was no bubbling in it, but there seemed to be a
slow rhythmical movement, as if fresh currents were always
welling out of the deeps and always returning. I have no doubt
that it would have been crystal clear if there had been any
light, but, as I saw it, it was a surface of darkest jade,
opaque, impenetrable, swaying to some magic impulse from the
heart of the earth.</p>

<p>It is difficult to explain just the effect it had on me. I had
been solemnised before, but this grove and fountain gave me the
abject shapeless fear of a child. I felt that somehow I had
strayed beyond the reasonable world. The place was clean against
nature. It was early summer, so these dark aisles should have
been alive with moths and flying ants and all the thousand noises
of night. Instead it was utterly silent and lifeless, dead as a
stone except for the secret pulsing of the cold waters.</p>

<p>I had had quite enough. It is an absurd thing to confess, but
I bolted--shuffled through the undergrowth and back into the
<i>rondavel,</i> where the old man still sat like Buddha on the
floor.</p>

<p>"You have seen?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have seen," I said--"but I do not know what I have seen.
Father, be merciful to foolish youth."</p>

<p>He repeated again the words that had chilled me before. "What
was there has gone to fulfil the law."</p>

<p>I ran all the way back to our outspan, and took some unholy
tosses on the road, for I had got it into my head that Andrew was
in danger. I don't think I ever believed in his green wildebeest,
but he had been positive that the place was full of animals, and
I knew for a fact that it was empty. Had some fearsome brute been
unloosed on the world?</p>

<p>I found Andrew in our tent, and the kettle I had put on to
boil empty and the fire out. The boy was sleeping heavily with a
flushed face, and I saw what had happened. He was practically a
teetotaller, but he had chosen to swallow a good third of one of
our four bottles of whisky. The compulsion must have been pretty
strong which drove him to drink.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>After that our expedition went from bad to worse. In the
morning there was no water to be had, and I didn't see myself
shouldering a calabash and going back to the grove. Also our boys
did not return, and not a soul in the kraal would come near us.
Indeed, all night they had kept up a most distressing racket,
wailing and beating little drums. It was no use staying on, and,
for myself, I had a strong desire to get out of the
neighbourhood. The experience of the night before had left an
aftertaste of disquiet in my mind, and I wanted to flee from I
knew not what. Andrew was obviously a sick man. We did not carry
clinical thermometers in those days, but he certainly had fever
on him.</p>

<p>So we inspanned after breakfast, and a heavy job trekking is
when you have to do all the work yourself. I drove the wagon and
Andrew the Cape-cart, and I wondered how long he would be able to
sit on his seat. My notion was that by going east we might be
able to hire fresh boys, and start prospecting in the
hill-country above the bend of the Limpopo.</p>

<p>But the word had gone out against us. You know the way in
which Kaffirs send news for a hundred miles as quick as the
telegraph--by drum-taps or telepathy--explain it any way you
like. Well, we struck a big kraal that afternoon, but not a word
would they say to us. Indeed, they were actually threatening, and
I had to show my revolver and speak pretty stiffly before we got
off. It was the same next day, and I grew nervous about our
provisions, for we couldn't buy anything--not a chicken or an egg
or a mealie-cob. Andrew was a jolly companion. He had relapsed
into the primeval lout, and his manners were those of a cave-man.
If he had not been patently suffering, I would have found it hard
to keep my temper.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a bright look-out, and to crown all on the
third morning Andrew went down like a log with the worst bout of
malaria I have ever seen. That fairly put the lid on it. I
thought it was going to be black-water, and all my irritation at
the boy vanished in my anxiety. There was nothing for it but to
give up the expedition and make the best speed possible to the
coast. I made for Portuguese territory, and that evening got to
the Limpopo. Happily we struck a more civil brand of native, who
had not heard of our performances, and I was able to make a
bargain with the headman of the village, who undertook to take
charge of our outfit till it was sent for, and sold us a big
native boat. I hired four lusty fellows as rowers and next
morning we started down the river.</p>

<p>We spent a giddy five days before I planted Andrew in hospital
at Louren&ccedil;o Marques. The sickness was not black-water,
thank God, but it was a good deal more than ordinary malaria;
indeed, I think there was a touch of brain fever in it. Curiously
enough I was rather relieved when it came. I had been scared by
the boy's behaviour the first two days. I thought that the old
priest had actually laid some curse on him; I remembered how the
glade and the well had solemnised even me, and I considered that
Andrew, with a Kaffir strain somewhere in his ancestry, was
probably susceptible to something which left me cold. I had
knocked too much about Africa to be a dogmatic sceptic about the
mysteries of the heathen. But this fever seemed to explain it. He
had been sickening for it; that was why he had behaved so badly
to the old man, and had come back babbling about a green
wildebeest. I knew that the beginnings of fever often make a man
light-headed so that he loses all self-control and gets odd
fancies. . . . All the same I didn't quite convince myself. I
couldn't get out of my head the picture of the old man and his
ominous words, or that empty grove under the sunset.</p>

<p>I did my best for the boy, and before we reached the coast the
worst had passed. A bed was made for him in the stern, and I had
to watch him by night and day to prevent him going overboard
among the crocodiles. He was apt to be violent, for in his
madness he thought he was being chased, and sometimes I had all I
could do to keep him in the boat. He would scream like a thing
demented, and plead, and curse, and I noticed as a queer thing
that his ravings were never in Dutch but always in Kaffir--mostly
the Sesutu which he had learnt in his childhood. I expected to
hear him mention the green wildebeest, but to my comfort he never
uttered the name. He gave no clue to what frightened him, but it
must have been a full-sized terror, for every nerve in his body
seemed to be quivering, and I didn't care to look at his
eyes.</p>

<p>The upshot was that I left him in bed in hospital, as weak as
a kitten, but with the fever gone and restored to his right mind.
He was again the good fellow I had known, very apologetic and
grateful. So with an easy conscience I arranged for the
retrieving of my outfit and returned to the Rand.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Well, for six months I lost sight of Andrew. I had to go to
Namaqualand, and then up to the copper country of Barotseland,
which wasn't as easy a trek as it is to-day. I had one letter
from him, written from Johannesburg--not a very satisfactory
epistle, for I gathered that the boy was very unsettled. He had
quarrelled with his family, and he didn't seem to be contented
with the job he had got in the goldfields. As I had known him he
had been a sort of school-book industrious apprentice, determined
to get on in the world, and not in the least afraid of a dull job
and uncongenial company. But this letter was full of small
grouses. He wanted badly to have a talk with me--thought of
chucking his work and making a trip north to see me; and he ended
with an underlined request that I should telegraph when I was
coming down-country. As it happened I had no chance just then of
sending a telegram, and later I forgot about it.</p>

<p>By and by I finished my tour and was at the Falls, where I got
a local Rhodesian paper. From it I had news of Andrew with a
vengeance. There were columns about a murder in the bushveld--two
men had gone out to look for Kruger's treasure and one had shot
the other, and to my horror I found that the one who was now
lying in Pretoria gaol under sentence of death was my unhappy
friend.</p>

<p>You remember the wild yarns after the Boer War about a
treasure of gold which Kruger in his flight to the coast had
buried somewhere in the Selati country. That, of course, was all
nonsense: the wily ex-President had long before seen the main
funds safe in a European bank. But I daresay some of the
officials had got away with Treasury balances, and there may have
been bullion cached in the bushveld. Anyhow every scallywag south
of the Zambesi was agog about the business, and there were no end
of expeditions which never found a single Transvaal sovereign.
Well, it seemed that two months before Andrew and a Dutchman
called Smit had started out to try their luck, and somewhere on
the Olifants the two had gone out one evening and only one had
returned. Smit was found by the native boys with a hole in his
head, and it was proved that the bullet came from Andrew's rifle,
which he had been carrying when the two set out. After that the
story became obscure. Andrew had been very excited when he
returned and declared that he had "done it at last," but when
Smit's body was found he denied that he had shot him. But it was
clear that Smit had been killed by Andrew's sporting .303, and
the natives swore that the men had been constantly quarrelling
and that Andrew had always shown a very odd temper. The Crown
prosecutor argued that the two believed they had found treasure,
and that Andrew had murdered Smit in cold blood to prevent his
sharing. The defence seemed to be chiefly the impossibility of a
guilty man behaving as Andrew had behaved, and the likelihood of
his having fired at a beast in the dark and killed his companion.
It sounded to me very thin, and the jury did not believe it, for
their verdict was wilful murder.</p>

<p>I knew that it was simply incredible that Andrew could have
committed the crime. Men are queer cattle, and I wouldn't have
put even murder past certain fairly decent fellows I knew, but
this boy was emphatically not one of them. Unless he had gone
stark mad I was positive that he could never have taken human
life. I knew him intimately, in the way you know a fellow you
have lived alone with for months, and that was one of the things
I could bank on. All the same it seemed clear that he had shot
Smit. . . . I sent the longest telegram I ever sent in my life to
a Scotch lawyer in Johannesburg called Dalgleish whom I believed
in, telling him to move heaven and earth to get a reprieve. He
was to see Andrew and wire me details about his state of mind. I
thought then that temporary madness was probably our best line,
and I believed myself that that was the explanation. I longed to
take the train forthwith to Pretoria, but I was tied by the heels
till the rest of my outfit came in. I was tortured by the thought
that the hanging might have already taken place, for that
wretched newspaper was a week old.</p>

<p>In two days I got Dalgleish's reply. He had seen the condemned
man, and had told him that he came from me. He reported that
Andrew was curiously peaceful and apathetic, and not very willing
to talk about the business except to declare his innocence.
Dalgleish thought him not quite right in his mind, but he had
been already examined, and the court had rejected the plea of
insanity. He sent his love to me and told me not to worry.</p>

<p>I stirred up Dalgleish again, and got a further reply. Andrew
admitted that he had fired the rifle, but not at Smit. He had
killed something, but what it was he would not say. He did not
seem to be in the least keen to save his neck.</p>

<p>When I reached Bulawayo, on my way south, I had a brain-wave,
but the thing seemed so preposterous that I could hardly take it
seriously. Still I daren't neglect any chance, so I wired again
to Dalgleish to try to have the execution postponed, until he got
hold of the priest who lived in the berg above the Pufuri. I gave
him full directions how to find him. I said that the old man had
laid some curse on Andrew, and that that might explain his state
of mind. After all demoniacal possession must be equivalent in
law to insanity. But by this time I had become rather hopeless.
It seemed a futile thing to be wiring this rigmarole when every
hour was bringing the gallows nearer.</p>

<p>I left the railroad at Mafeking, for I thought I could save
the long circuit by De Aar by trekking across country. I would
have done better to stick to the train, for everything went wrong
with me. I had a breakdown at the drift of the Selous river and
had to wait a day in Rustenburg, and I had trouble again at
Commando Nek, so that it was the evening of the third day before
I reached Pretoria. . . . As I feared, it was all over. They told
me in the hotel that Andrew had been hanged that morning.</p>

<p>I went back to Johannesburg to see Dalgleish with a cold
horror at my heart and complete mystification in my head. The
Devil had taken an active hand in things and caused a hideous
miscarriage of justice. If there had been anybody I could blame I
would have felt better, but the fault seemed to lie only with the
crookedness of fate. . . . Dalgleish could tell me little. Smit
had been the ordinary scallywag, not much of a fellow and no
great loss to the world; the puzzle was why Andrew wanted to go
with him. The boy in his last days had been utterly
apathetic--bore no grudge against anybody--appeared at peace with
the world, but didn't seem to want to live. The predikant who
visited him daily could make nothing of him. He appeared to be
sane enough, but, beyond declaring his innocence, was not
inclined to talk, and gave no assistance to those who were trying
to get a reprieve . . . scarcely took any interest in it. . . .
He had asked repeatedly for me, and had occupied his last days in
writing me a long letter, which was to be delivered unopened into
my hand. Dalgleish gave me the thing, seven pages in Andrew's
neat caligraphy, and in the evening on his stoep I read it.</p>

<p>It was like a voice speaking to me out of the grave, but it
was not the voice I knew. Gone was the enlightened
commercially-minded young man, who had shed all superstition, and
had a dapper explanation for everything in heaven and earth. It
was a crude boy who had written those pages, a boy in whose soul
old Calvinistic terrors had been awakened, and terrors older
still out of primordial African shadows.</p>

<p>He had committed a great sin--that was the point he insisted
upon, and by this sin he had set free something awful to prey on
the world. . . . At first it seemed sheer raving mania to me, but
as I mused on it I remembered my own feelings in that empty
grove. I had been solemnised, and this boy, with that in his
blood which was not in mine, had suffered a cataclysmic spiritual
experience. He did not dwell on it, but his few sentences were
eloquent in their harsh intensity. He had struggled, he had tried
to make light of it, to forget it, to despise it; but it rode him
like a nightmare. He thought he was going mad. I had been right
about that touch of brain fever.</p>

<p>As far as I could make it out, he believed that from that
outraged sanctuary something real and living had gone forth,
something at any rate of flesh and blood. But this idea may not
have come to him till later, when his mind had been for several
months in torture, and he had lost the power of sleep. At first,
I think, his trouble was only an indefinite haunting, a sense of
sin and impending retribution. But in Johannesburg the
<i>malaise</i> had taken concrete form. He believed that through
his act something awful was at large, with infinite power for
evil--evil not only against the wrongdoer himself but against the
world. And he believed that it might still be stopped, that it
was still in the eastern bush. So crude a fancy showed how his
normal intelligence had gone to bits. He had tumbled again into
the backveld world of his childhood.</p>

<p>He decided to go and look for it. That was where the tough
white strain in him came out. He might have a Kaffir's blind
terrors, but he had the frontier Boer's cast-iron courage. If you
think of it, it needed a pretty stout heart to set out to find a
thing the thought of which set every nerve quivering. I confess I
didn't like to contemplate that lonely, white-faced, tormented
boy. I think he knew that tragedy must be the end of it, but he
had to face up to that and take the consequences.</p>

<p>He heard of Smit's expedition, and took a half share in it.
Perhaps the fact that Smit had a baddish reputation was part of
the attraction. He didn't want as companion a man with whom he
had anything in common, for he had to think his own thoughts and
follow his own course.</p>

<p>Well, you know the end of it. In his letter he said nothing
about the journey, except that he had found what he sought. I can
readily believe that the two did not agree very well--the one
hungry for mythical treasure, the other with a problem which all
the gold in Africa could not solve. . . . Somewhere, somehow,
down in the Selati bushveld his incubus took bodily form, and he
met--or thought he met--the thing which his impiety had released.
I suppose we must call it madness. He shot his comrade, and
thought he had killed an animal. "If they had looked next morning
they would have found the spoor," he wrote. Smit's death didn't
seem to trouble him at all--I don't think he quite realised it.
The thing that mattered for him was that he had put an end to a
terror and in some way made atonement. "Good-bye, and don't worry
about me," were the last words, "I am quite content."</p>

<p>I sat a long time thinking, while the sun went down over the
Magaliesberg. A gramophone was grinding away on an adjacent
stoep, and the noise of the stamps on the Rand came like far-away
drums. People at that time used to quote some Latin phrase about
a new thing always coming out of Africa. I thought that it was
not the new things in Africa that mattered so much as the old
things.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I proposed to revisit that berg above the Pufuri and have a
word with the priest, but I did not get a chance till the
following summer, when I trekked down the Limpopo from Main
Drift. I didn't like the job, but I felt bound to have it out
with that old man for Andrew's sake. You see, I wanted something
more to convince the Wakkerstroom household that the boy had not
been guilty, as his father thought, of the sin of Cain.</p>

<p>I came round the corner of the berg one January evening after
a day of blistering heat, and looked down on the cup of green
pasture. One glance showed me that there was not going to be any
explanation with the priest. . . . A bit of the cliff had broken
away, and the rock fall had simply blotted out the grove and the
<i>rondavel.</i> A huge mass of debris sloped down from half-way
up the hill, and buried under it were the tall trees through
which I had peered up at the sky. Already it was feathered with
thorn-bush and grasses. There were no patches of crops on the
sides of the cup, and crumbling mud walls were all that remained
of the kraal. The jungle had flowed over the village, and, when I
entered it, great moon flowers sprawled on the rubble, looking in
the dusk like ghosts of a vanished race.</p>

<p>There was one new feature in the place. The landslip must have
released the underground water, for a stream now flowed down the
hollow. Beside it, in a meadow full of agapanthus and arum
lilies, I found two Australian prospectors. One of them--he had
been a Melbourne bank-clerk--had a poetic soul. "Nice little
place," he said. "Not littered up with black fellows. If I were
on a homesteading job, I reckon I'd squat here."</p>

<h2>PART I--THE FRYING-PAN</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Lamancha had been staying for the week-end at some country
house, and had returned full of wrath at the way he had been made
to spend his evenings. "I thought I hated bridge," he said, "but
I almost longed for it as a change from cracking my brain and my
memory to find lines from poets I had forgotten to describe
people I didn't know. I don't like games that make me feel a
congenital idiot. But there was one that rather amused me. You
invented a preposterous situation and the point was to explain
naturally how it came about. Drink, lunacy and practical joking
were barred as explanations. One problem given was the Bishop of
London on a camel, with a string of sea-trout round his neck,
playing on a penny whistle on the Hoe at Plymouth. There was a
fellow there, a Chancery K.C., who provided a perfectly sensible
explanation."</p>

<p>"I have heard of stranger things," said Sandy Arbuthnot, and
he winked at Burminster, who flushed and looked uncomfortable. As
the rest of our eyes took the same direction the flush deepened
on that round cheerful face.</p>

<p>"It's no good, Mike," said Arbuthnot. "We've been waiting
months for that story of yours, and this is the place and the
hour for it. We'll take no denial."</p>

<p>"Confound you, Sandy, I can't tell it. It's too dashed
silly."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. It's full of profound philosophical lessons,
and it's sheer romance, as somebody has defined the
thing--strangeness flowering from the commonplace. So pull up
your socks and get going."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to begin," said Burminster.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll start it for you. . . . The scene is the
railway-station of Langshiels on the Scottish Borders on a
certain day last summer. On the platform are various gentlemen in
their best clothes with rosettes in their buttonholes--all
strictly sober, it being but the third hour of the afternoon.
There are also the rudiments of a brass band. Clearly a
distinguished visitor is expected. The train enters the station,
and from a third-class carriage descends our only Mike with a
muddy face and a scratched nose. He is habited in dirty white
cord breeches, shocking old butcher boots, a purple knitted
waistcoat, and what I believe is called a morning coat; over all
this splendour a ticky ulster--clearly not his own since it does
not meet--and on his head an unspeakable bowler hat. He is
welcomed by the deputation and departs, attended by the band, to
a political meeting in the Town Hall. But first--I quote from the
local paper--'the Duke, who had arrived in sporting costume,
proceeded to the Station Hotel, where he rapidly changed.' We
want to know the reason of these cantrips."</p>

<p>Burminster took a long pull at his tankard, and looked round
the company with more composure.</p>

<p>"It isn't much of a story, but it's true, and, like nearly
every scrape I ever got into, Archie Roylance was at the bottom
of it. It all started from a discussion I had with Archie. He was
staying with me at Larristane, and we got talking about the old
Border raiders and the way the face of the countryside had
changed and that sort of thing. Archie said that, now the land
was as bare as a marble-topped table and there was no cover on
the hills to hide a tomtit, a man couldn't ride five miles
anywhere between the Cheviots and the Clyde without being seen by
a dozen people. I said that there was still plenty of cover if
you knew how to use it--that you could hide yourself as well on
bent and heather as in a thick wood if you studied the shadows
and the lie of the land, same as an aeroplane can hide itself in
an empty sky. Well, we argued and argued, and the upshot was that
I backed myself to ride an agreed course, without Archie spotting
me. There wasn't much money on it--only an even sovereign--but we
both worked ourselves up into considerable keenness. That was
where I fell down. I might have known that anything Archie was
keen about would end in the soup.</p>

<p>"The course we fixed was about fifteen miles long, from
Gledfoot bridge over the hills between Gled and Aller and the
Blae Moor to the Mains of Blae. That was close to Kirk Aller, and
we agreed, if we didn't meet before, to foregather at the Cross
Keys and have tea and motor home. Archie was to start from a
point about four miles north-east of Gledfoot and cut in on my
road at a tangent. I could shape any course I liked, but I
couldn't win unless I got to the Mains of Blae before five
o'clock without being spotted. The rule about that was that he
must get within speaking distance of me--say three hundred
yards--before he held me up. All the Larristane horses were at
grass, so we couldn't look for pace. I chose an old hunter of
mine that was very leery about bogs; Archie picked a young mare
that I had hunted the season before and that he had wanted to buy
from me. He said that by rights he ought to have the speedier
steed, since, if he spotted me, he had more or less to ride me
down.</p>

<p>"We thought it was only a pleasant summer day's diversion. I
didn't want to give more than a day to it, for I had guests
arriving that evening, and on the Wednesday--this was a Monday--I
had to take the chair for Deloraine at a big Conservative meeting
at Langshiels, and I meant to give a lot of time to preparing a
speech. I ought to say that neither of us knew the bit of country
beyond its general lines, and we were forbidden to carry maps.
The horses were sent on, and at 9.30 a.m. I was at Gledfoot
bridge ready to start. I was wearing khaki riding breeches, polo
boots, an old shooting coat and a pretty old felt hat. I mention
my costume, for later it became important.</p>

<p>"I may as well finish with Archie, for he doesn't come any
more into this tale. He hadn't been half an hour in the saddle
when he wandered into a bog, and it took him till three in the
afternoon to get his horse out. Consequently he chucked in his
hand, and went back to Larristane. So all the time I was riding
cunning and watching out of my right eye to see him on the
skyline he was sweating and blaspheming in a peat moss.</p>

<p>"I started from Gledfoot up the Rinks burn in very good
spirits, for I had been studying the big Ordnance map and I
believed I had a soft thing. Beyond the Rinks Hope I would cross
the ridge to the top of the Skyre burn, which at its head is all
split up into deep grassy gullies. I had guessed this from the
map, and the people at Gledfoot had confirmed it. By one or other
of these gullies I could ride in good cover till I reached a big
wood of firs that stretched for a mile down the left bank of the
burn. Archie, to cut in on me, had a pretty steep hill to cross,
and I calculated that by the time he got on the skyline I would
be in the shelter of one of the gullies or even behind the wood.
Not seeing me on the upper Skyre, he would think that I had
bustled a bit and would look for me lower down the glen. I would
lie doggo and watch for him, and when I saw him properly started
I meant to slip up a side burn and get into the parallel glen of
the Hollin. Once there I would ride like blazes, and either get
to the Blae Moor before him--in which case I would simply canter
at ease up to the Mains of Blae--or, if I saw him ahead of me,
fetch a circuit among the plantings and come in on the farm from
the other side. That was the general lay out, but I had other
dodges in hand in case Archie tried to be clever.</p>

<p>"So I tittuped along the hill turf beside the Rinks burn,
feeling happy and pretty certain I would win. My horse,
considering he was fresh from the grass, behaved very well, and
we travelled in good style. My head was full of what I was going
to say at Langshiels, and I thought of some rather fine
things--'Our opponents would wreck the old world in order to
build a new, but you cannot found any system on chaos, not even
Communism'--I rather fancied that. Well, to make a long story
short, I got to the Rinks Hope in thirty minutes, and there I
found the herd gathering his black-faced lambs.</p>

<p>"Curiously enough I knew the man--Prentice they called
him--for he had been one of the young shepherds at Larristane. So
I stopped to have a word with him, and watched him at work. He
was short-handed for the job, and he had a young collie only
half-trained, so I offered to give him a hand and show my form as
a mounted stockman. The top of that glen was splendid going, and
I volunteered to round up the west hirsel. I considered that I
had plenty of time and could spare ten minutes to help a pal.</p>

<p>"It was a dashed difficult job, and it took me a good
half-hour, and it was a mercy my horse didn't get an over-reach
among the mossy wellheads. However, I did it, and when I started
off again both I and my beast were in a lather of sweat. That
must have confused me, and the way I had been making circles
round the sheep, for I struck the wrong feeder, and instead of
following the one that led to the top of the Skyre burn I kept
too much to my left. When I got to the watershed I looked down on
a country utterly different from what I had expected. There was
no delta of deep gullies, but a broad green cup seamed with stone
walls, and below it a short glen which presently ran out into the
broader vale of the Aller.</p>

<p>"The visibility was none too good, so I could not make out the
further prospect. I ought to have realised that this was not the
Skyre burn. But I only concluded that I had misread the map, and
besides, there was a big wood lower down which I thought was the
one I had remarked. There was no sign of Archie as yet on the
high hills to my right, so I decided I had better get off the
skyline and make my best speed across that bare green cup.</p>

<p>"It took me a long time, for I had a lot of trouble with the
stone dykes. The few gates were all fastened up with wire, and I
couldn't manage to undo them. So I had to scramble over the first
dyke, and half pull down the next, and what with one thing and
another I wasted a shocking amount of time. When I got to the
bottom I found that the burn was the merest trickle, not the
strong stream of the Skyre, which is a famous water for trout.
But there, just ahead of me, was the big wood, so I decided I
must be right after all.</p>

<p>"I had kept my eye lifting to the ridge on the right, and
suddenly I saw Archie. I know now that it wasn't he, but it was a
man on a horse and it looked his living image. He was well down
the hillside and he was moving fast. He didn't appear to have
seen me, but I realised that he would in a minute, unless I found
cover.</p>

<p>"I jogged my beast with the spur, and in three seconds was
under cover of the fir-wood. But here I found a track, and it
struck me that it was this track which Archie was following, and
that he would soon be up with me. The only thing to do seemed to
be to get inside the wood. But this was easier said than done,
for a great wall with broken bottles on the top ran round that
blessed place. I had to do something pretty quick, for I could
hear the sound of hoofs behind me, and on the left there was
nothing but the benty side of a hill.</p>

<p>"Just then I saw a gate, a massive thing of close-set oak
splints, and for a mercy it was open. I pushed through it and
slammed it behind me. It shut with a sharp click as if it was a
patent self-locking arrangement. A second later I heard the noise
of a horse outside and hands trying the gate. Plainly they
couldn't open it. The man I thought was Archie said 'Damn' and
moved away.</p>

<p>"I had found sanctuary, but the question now was how to get
out of it. I dismounted and wrestled with the gate, but it was as
firm as a rock. About this time I began to realise that something
was wrong, for I couldn't think why Archie should have wanted to
get through the gate if he hadn't seen me, and, if he had seen
me, why he hadn't shouted, according to our rules. Besides, this
wasn't a wood, it was the grounds of some house, and the map had
shown no house in the Skyre glen. . . . The only thing to do was
to find somebody to let me out. I didn't like the notion of
riding about in a stranger's policies, so I knotted my bridle and
let my beast graze, while I proceeded on foot to prospect.</p>

<p>"The ground shelved steeply, and almost at once my feet went
from under me and I slithered down a bank of raw earth. You see
there was no grip in the smooth soles of my polo boots. The next
I knew I had banged hard into the back of a little wooden shelter
which stood on a sunny mantelpiece of turf above the stream. I
picked myself up and limped round the erection, rubbing the dirt
from my eyes, and came face to face with a group of people.</p>

<p>"They were all women, except one man, who was reading aloud to
them, and they were all lying in long chairs. Pretty girls they
seemed to be from the glimpse I had of them, but rather pale, and
they all wore bright-coloured cloaks.</p>

<p>"I daresay I looked a bit of a ruffian, for I was very warm
and had got rather dirty in slithering down, and had a rent in my
breeches. At the sight of me the women gave one collective bleat
like a snipe, and gathered up their skirts and ran. I could see
their cloaks glimmering as they dodged like woodcock among the
rhododendrons.</p>

<p>"The man dropped his book and got up and faced me. He was a
young fellow with a cadaverous face and side-whiskers, and he
seemed to be in a funk of something, for his lips twitched and
his hands shook as if he had fever. I could see that he was
struggling to keep calm.</p>

<p>"'So you've come back, Mr. Brumby,' he said. 'I hope you had a
g-good time?'</p>

<p>"For a moment I had a horrid suspicion that he knew me, for
they used to call me 'Brummy' at school. A second look convinced
me that we had never met, and I realised that the word he had
used was Brumby. I hadn't a notion what he meant, but the only
thing seemed to be to brazen it out. That was where I played the
fool. I ought to have explained my mistake there and then, but I
still had the notion that Archie was hanging about, and I wanted
to dodge him. I dropped into a long chair, and said that I had
come back and that it was a pleasant day. Then I got out my
pipe.</p>

<p>"'Here, you mustn't do that,' he said. 'It isn't allowed.'</p>

<p>"I put the pipe away, and wondered what lunatic asylum I had
wandered into. I wasn't permitted to wonder long, for up the path
from the rhododendrons came two people in a mighty hurry. One was
an anxious-faced oldish man dressed like a valet, and the other a
middle-aged woman in nurse's uniform. Both seemed to be excited,
and both to be trying to preserve an air of coolness.</p>

<p>"'Ah, Schwester,' said the fellow with the whiskers. 'Here is
Mr. Brumby back again and none the worse.'</p>

<p>"The woman, who had kind eyes and a nice gurgling voice,
looked at me reproachfully.</p>

<p>"'I hope you haven't taken any harm, sir,' she said. 'We had
better go back to the house, and Mr. Grimpus will give you a nice
bath and a change, and you'll lie down a bit before luncheon. You
must be very tired, sir. You'd better take Mr. Grimpus's
arm.'</p>

<p>"My head seemed to be spinning, but I thought it best to lie
low and do what I was told till I got some light. Silly ass that
I was, I was still on the tack of dodging Archie. I could easily
have floored Grimpus, and the man with the whiskers wouldn't have
troubled me much, but there was still the glass-topped wall to
get over, and there might be heftier people about, grooms and
gardeners and the like. Above all, I didn't want to make any more
scenes, for I had already scared a lot of sick ladies into the
rhododendrons.</p>

<p>"So I went off quite peaceably with Grimpus and the sister,
and presently we came to a house like a small hydropathic,
hideously ugly but beautifully placed, with a view south to the
Aller valley. There were more nurses in the hall and a porter
with a jaw like a prize-fighter. Well, I went up in a lift to the
second floor, and there was a bedroom and a balcony, and several
trunks, and brushes on the dressing-table lettered H. B. They
made me strip and get into a dressing-gown, and then a doctor
arrived, a grim fellow with gold spectacles and a soft, bedside
manner. He spoke to me soothingly about the beauty of the weather
and how the heather would soon be in bloom on the hill; he also
felt my pulse and took my blood pressure, and talked for a long
time in a corner with the sister. If he said there was anything
wrong with me he lied, for I had never felt fitter in my life
except for the bewilderment of my brain.</p>

<p>"Then I was taken down in a lift to the basement, and Grimpus
started out to give me a bath. My hat! That was a bath! I lay in
six inches of scalding water, while a boiling cataract beat on my
stomach; then it changed to hot hail and then to gouts that hit
like a pickaxe; and then it all turned to ice. But it made me
feel uncommonly frisky. After that they took me back to my
bedroom and I had a gruelling massage, and what I believe they
call violet rays. By this time I was fairly bursting with vim,
but I thought it best to be quite passive, and when they told me
I must try to sleep before luncheon, I only grinned and put my
head on the pillow like a child. When they left me I badly wanted
to smoke, but my pipe had gone with my clothes, and I found laid
out for me a complete suit of the man Brumby's flannels.</p>

<p>"As I lay and reflected I began to get my bearings. I knew
where I was. It was a place called Craigiedean, about six miles
from Kirk Aller, which had been used as a shell-shock hospital
during the War and had been kept on as a home for nervous cases.
It wasn't a private asylum, as I had thought at first; it called
itself a Kurhaus, and was supposed to be the last thing in
science outside Germany. Now and then, however, it got some
baddish cases, people who were almost off their rocker, and I
fancied that Brumby was one. He was apparently my double, but I
didn't believe in exact doubles, so I guessed that he had just
arrived, and hadn't given the staff time to know him well before
he went off on the bend. The horseman whom I had taken for Archie
must have been out scouring the hills for him.</p>

<p>"Well, I had dished Archie all right, but I had also dished
myself. At any moment the real Brumby might wander back, and then
there would be a nice show up. The one thing that terrified me
was that my identity should be discovered, for this was more or
less my own countryside, and I should look a proper ass if it got
about that I had been breaking into a nerve-cure place,
frightening women, and getting myself treated like a gentle
loony. Then I remembered that my horse was in the wood and might
be trusted to keep on grazing along the inside of the wall where
nobody went. My best plan seemed to be to wait my chance, slip
out of the house, recover my beast and find some way out of the
infernal park. The wall couldn't be everywhere, for after all the
place wasn't an asylum.</p>

<p>"A gong sounded for luncheon, so I nipped up, and got into
Brumby's flannels. They were all right for length, but a bit
roomy. My money and the odds and ends from my own pockets were
laid out on the dressing-table, but not my pipe and pouch, which
I judged had been confiscated.</p>

<p>"I wandered downstairs to a big dining-room, full of little
tables, with the most melancholy outfit seated at them that you
ever saw in all your days. The usual thing was to have a table to
oneself, but sometimes two people shared one--husband and wife,
no doubt, or mother and daughter. There were eight males
including me, and the rest were females of every age from
flappers to grandmothers. Some looked pretty sick, some quite
blooming, but all had a watchful air, as if they were holding
themselves in and pursuing some strict regime. There was no
conversation, and everybody had brought a book or a magazine
which they diligently studied. In the centre of each table,
beside the salt and pepper, stood a little fleet of medicine
bottles. The sister who led me to my place planted down two
beside me.</p>

<p>"I soon saw the reason of the literary absorption. The food
was simply bestial. I was hungry and thirsty enough to have eaten
two beefsteaks and drunk a quart of beer, and all I got was three
rusks, a plate of thin soup, a pur&eacute;e of vegetables and a
milk pudding in a teacup. I envied the real Brumby, who at that
moment, if he had any sense, was doing himself well in a
public-house. I didn't dare to ask for more in case of inviting
awkward questions, so I had plenty of leisure to observe the
company. Nobody looked at anybody else, for it seemed to be the
fashion to pretend you were alone in a wilderness, and even the
couples did not talk to each other. I made a cautious preliminary
survey to see if there was anyone I knew, but they were all
strangers. After a time I felt so lonely that I wanted to
howl.</p>

<p>"At last the company began to get up and straggle out. The
sister whom I had seen first--the others called her Schwester and
she seemed to be rather a boss--appeared with a bright smile and
gave me my medicine. I had to take two pills and some horrid
drops out of a brown bottle. I pretended to be very docile, and I
thought that I'd take the chance to pave the way to getting to my
horse. So I said that I felt completely rested, and would like a
walk that afternoon. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"'No, Mr. Brumby. Dr. Miggle's orders are positive that you
rest to-day.'</p>

<p>"'But I'm feeling really very fit,' I protested. 'I'm the kind
of man who needs a lot of exercise.'</p>

<p>"'Not yet,' she said with a patient smile. 'At present your
energy is morbid. It comes from an irregular nervous complex, and
we must first cure that before you can lead a normal life. Soon
you'll be having nice long walks. You promised your wife, you
know, to do everything that you were told, and it was very wrong
of you to slip out last night and make us all so anxious. Dr.
Miggle says that must <i>never</i> happen again.' And she wagged
a reproving finger.</p>

<p>"So I had a wife to add to my troubles. I began now to be
really worried, for not only might Brumby turn up any moment, but
his precious spouse, and I didn't see how I was to explain to her
what I was doing in her husband's trousers. Also the last
sentence disquieted me. Dr. Miggle was determined that I should
not bolt again, and he looked a resolute lad. That meant that I
would be always under observation, and that at night my bedroom
door would be locked.</p>

<p>"I made an errand to go up to my room, while Grimpus waited
for me in the hall, and had a look at the window. There was a
fine thick Virginia creeper which would make it easy to get to
the floor beneath, but it was perfectly impossible to reach the
ground, for below was a great chasm of a basement. There was
nothing doing that way, unless I went through the room beneath,
and that meant another outrage and probably an appalling row.</p>

<p>"I felt very dispirited as I descended the stairs, till I saw
a woman coming out of that identical room. . . . Blessed if it
wasn't my Aunt Letitia!</p>

<p>"I needn't have been surprised, for she gave herself out as a
martyr to nerves, and was always racing about the world looking
for a cure. She saw me, took me for Brumby, and hurried away.
Evidently Brumby's doings had got about, and there were
suspicions of his sanity. The moment was not propitious for
following her, since Grimpus was looking at me.</p>

<p>"I was escorted to the terrace by Grimpus, tucked up in a long
chair, and told to stay there and bask in the sun. I must not
read, but I could sleep if I liked. I never felt less like
slumber, for I was getting to be a very good imitation of a
mental case. I must get hold of Aunt Letitia. I could see her in
her chair at the other end of the terrace, but if I got up and
went to her she would take me for that loony Brumby and have a
fit.</p>

<p>"I lay cogitating and baking in the sun for about two hours.
Then I observed that sisters were bringing out tea or medicines
to some of the patients and I thought I saw a chance of a move. I
called one of them to me, and in a nice invalidish voice
complained that the sun was too hot for me and that I wanted to
be moved to the other end where there was more shade. The sister
went off to find Grimpus and presently that sportsman
appeared.</p>

<p>"'I've had enough of this sun-bath,' I told him, 'and I feel a
headache coming. I want you to shift me to the shade of the
beeches over there.'</p>

<p>"'Very good, sir,' he said, and helped me to rise, while he
picked up chair and rugs. I tottered delicately after him, and
indicated a vacant space next to Aunt Letitia. She was dozing,
and mercifully did not see me. The chair on my other side was
occupied by an old gentleman who was sound asleep.</p>

<p>"I waited for a few minutes and began to wriggle my chair a
bit nearer. Then I made a pellet of earth from a crack in the
paving stones and jerked it neatly on to her face.</p>

<p>"'Hist!' I whispered. 'Wake up, Aunt Letty.'</p>

<p>"She opened one indignant eye, and turned it on me, and I
thought she was going to swoon.</p>

<p>"'Aunt Letty,' I said in an agonised voice. 'For Heaven's sake
don't shout. I'm not Brumby. I'm your nephew Michael.'</p>

<p>"Her nerves were better than I thought, for she managed to
take a pull on herself and listen to me while I muttered my tale.
I could see that she hated the whole affair, and had some kind of
grievance against me for outraging the sanctity of her pet cure.
However, after a bit of parleying, she behaved like a brick.</p>

<p>"'You are the head of our family, Michael,' she said, 'and I
am bound to help you out of the position in which your own
rashness has placed you. I agree with you that it is essential to
have no disclosure of identity. It is the custom here for
patients to retire to their rooms at eight-thirty. At nine
o'clock I shall have my window open, and if you enter by it you
can leave by the door. That is the most I can do for you. Now
please be silent, for I am ordered to be very still for an hour
before tea.'</p>

<p>"You can imagine that after that the time went slowly. Grimpus
brought me a cup of tea and a rusk, and I fell asleep and only
woke when he came at half-past six to escort me indoors. I would
have given pounds for a pipe. Dinner was at seven, and I said
that I would not trouble to change, though Brumby's dress-clothes
were laid out on the bed. I had the needle badly, for I had a
horrid fear that Brumby might turn up before I got away.</p>

<p>"Presently the doctor arrived, and after cooing over me a bit
and feeling my pulse, he started out to cross-examine me about my
past life. I suppose that was to find out the subconscious
complexes which were upsetting my wits. I decided to go jolly
carefully, for I suspected that he had either given Brumby the
once-over or had got some sort of report about his case. I was
right, for the first thing he asked me was about striking my
sister at the age of five. Well, I haven't got a sister, but I
had to admit to beating Brumby's, and I said the horrible affair
still came between me and my sleep. That seemed to puzzle him,
for apparently I oughtn't to have been thinking about it; it
should have been buried deep in my unconscious self, and worrying
me like a thorn in your finger which you can't find. He asked me
a lot about my nurse, and I said that she had a brother who went
to gaol for sheep stealing. He liked that, and said it was a
fruitful line of inquiry. Also he wanted to know about my dreams,
and said I should write them down. I said I had dreamed that a
mare called Nursemaid won the Oaks, but found there was no such
animal running. That cheered him up a bit, and he said that he
thought my nurse might be the clue. At that I very nearly gave
the show away by laughing, for my nurse was old Alison Hyslop,
who is now the housekeeper at Larristane, and if anybody called
her a clue she'd have their blood.</p>

<p>"Dinner was no better than luncheon--the same soup and rusks
and vegetables, with a bit of ill-nourished chicken added. This
time I had to take three kinds of medicine instead of two. I told
the sister that I was very tired, and Grimpus took me upstairs at
eight o'clock. He said that Dr. Miggle proposed to give me
another go of violet rays, but I protested so strongly that I was
too sleepy for his ministrations that Grimpus, after going off to
consult him, announced that for that evening the rays would be
omitted. You see I was afraid that they would put me to bed and
remove my clothes, and I didn't see myself trapesing about the
country in Brumby's pyjamas.</p>

<p>"As Grimpus left me I heard the key turn in the lock. It was
as well that I had made a plan with Aunt Letitia.</p>

<p>"At nine o'clock I got out of my window. It was a fine night,
with the sun just setting and a young moon. The Virginia creeper
was sound, and in less than a minute I was outside Aunt Letitia's
window. She was waiting in a dressing-gown to let me in, and I
believe the old soul really enjoyed the escapade. She wanted to
give me money for my travels, but I told her that I had plenty. I
poked my nose out, saw that the staircase and hall were empty,
and quietly closed the door behind me.</p>

<p>"The big hall door was shut, and I could hear the
prize-fighting porter moving in his adjacent cubby hole. There
was no road that way, so I turned to the drawing-room, which
opened on the terrace. But that was all in darkness, and I
guessed that the windows were shuttered. There was nothing for it
but to try downstairs. I judged that the servants would be at
supper, so I went through a green-baize swing-door and down a
long flight of stone steps.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I blundered into a brightly lit kitchen. There was
no one in it, and beyond was a door which looked as if it might
lead to the open air. It actually led to a scullery, where a maid
was busy at a tap. She was singing to herself a song called 'When
the kye come hame,' so I knew she belonged to the countryside. So
did I, and I resolved to play the bold game.</p>

<p>"'Hey, lassie,' I said. 'Whaur's the road out o' this hoose? I
maun be back in Kirk Aller afore ten.'</p>

<p>"The girl stopped her singing and stared at me. Then in
response to my grin she laughed.</p>

<p>"'Are ye frae Kirk Aller?' she asked.</p>

<p>"'I've gotten a job there,' I said. 'I'm in the Cally station,
and I cam' up about a parcel for ane o' the leddies here. But I
come frae further up the water, Larristane way.'</p>

<p>"'D'ye say sae? I'm frae Gledside mysel'. What gars ye be in
sic a hurry. It's a fine nicht and there's a mune.'</p>

<p>"She was a flirtatious damsel, but I had no time for
dalliance.</p>

<p>"'There's a lassie in Kirk Aller will take the heid off me if
I keep her waitin'.'</p>

<p>"She tossed her head and laughed. 'Haste ye then, my mannie.
Is it Shanks' powny?'</p>

<p>"'Na, na, I've a bicycle ootbye.'</p>

<p>"'Well, through the wash-hoose and up the steps and roond by
the roddydendrums and ye're in the yaird. Guid nicht to ye.'</p>

<p>"I went up the steps like a lamplighter and dived into the
rhododendrons, coming out on the main avenue. It ran long and
straight to the lodge gates, and I didn't like the look of it. My
first business was to find my horse, and I had thought out more
or less the direction. The house stood on the right bank of the
burn, and if I kept to my left I would cross the said burn lower
down and could then walk up the other side. I did this without
trouble. I forded the burn in the meadow, and was soon climbing
the pine-wood which clothed the gorge. In less than twenty
minutes I had reached the gate in the wall by which I had
entered.</p>

<p>"There was no sign of my horse anywhere. I followed the wall
on my left till it curved round and crossed the burn, but the
beast was not there, and it was too dark to look for hoof-marks.
I tried to my right and got back to the level of the park, but
had no better luck. If I had had any sense I would have given up
the quest, and trusted to getting as far as Gledfoot on my own
feet. The horse might be trusted to turn up in his own time.
Instead I went blundering on in the half-light of the park, and
presently I blundered into trouble.</p>

<p>"Grimpus must have paid another visit to my room, found me
gone, seen the open window, and started a hue-and-cry. They would
not suspect my Aunt Letitia, and must have thought that I had
dropped like a cat into the basement. The pursuit was coming down
the avenue, thinking I had made for the lodge gates, and as
ill-luck would have it, I had selected that moment to cross the
drive, and they spotted me. I remember that out of a corner of
one eye I saw the lights of a fly coming up the drive, and I
wondered if Brumby had selected this inauspicious moment to
return.</p>

<p>"I fled into the park with three fellows after me. Providence
never meant me for a long-distance runner, and, besides, I was
feeling weak from lack of nourishment. But I was so scared of
what would happen if I was caught that I legged it like a miler,
and the blighters certainly didn't gain on me.</p>

<p>"But what I came to was the same weary old wall with the
bottle glass on the top of it. I was pretty desperate, and I
thought I saw a way. A young horse-chestnut tree grew near the
wall and one bough overhung it. I made a jump at the first
branch, caught it, and with a bit of trouble swung myself up into
the crutch. This took time, and one of the fellows came up and
made a grab at my leg, but I let him have Brumby's rubber-soled
heel in the jaw.</p>

<p>"I caught the bigger branch and wriggled along it till I was
above and beyond the wall. Then the dashed thing broke with my
twelve stone, and I descended heavily on what looked like a
highroad.</p>

<p>"There was no time to spare, though I was a bit shaken, for
the pursuit would not take long to follow me. I started off down
that road looking for shelter, and I found it almost at once.
There was a big covered horse-van moving ahead of me, with a
light showing from the interior. I sprinted after it, mounted the
step and stuck my head inside.</p>

<p>"'Can I come in?' I panted. 'Hide me for ten minutes and I'll
explain.'</p>

<p>"I saw an old, spectacled, whiskered face. It was portentously
solemn, but I thought I saw a twinkle in the eye.</p>

<p>"'Ay,' said a toothless mouth, 'ye can come in.' A hand
grabbed my collar, and I was hauled inside. That must have been
just when the first of my pursuers dropped over the wall."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>PART II--THE FIRE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>''I had got into a caravan which was a sort of bedroom, and
behind the driver's seat was a double curtain. There I made
myself inconspicuous while the old man parleyed with the
pursuit.</p>

<p>"'Hae ye seen a gentleman?' I could hear a panting voice. 'Him
that drappit ower the wa'? He was rinnin' hard.'</p>

<p>"'What kind of a gentleman?'</p>

<p>"'He had on grey claithes--aboot the same height as mysel'.'
The speaker was not Grimpus.</p>

<p>"'Naebody passed me,' was the strictly truthful answer. 'Ye'd
better seek the ither side o' the road among the bracken. There's
plenty hidy-holes there. Wha's the man?'</p>

<p>"'Ane o' the doctor's folk.' I knew, though I could not see,
that the man had tapped his forehead significantly. 'Aweel, I'll
try back. Guid nicht to ye.'</p>

<p>"I crept out of my refuge and found the old man regarding me
solemnly under the swinging lamp.</p>

<p>"'I'm one of the auld-fashioned Radicals,' he announced, 'and
I'm for the liberty o' the individual. I dinna hold wi' lockin'
folks up because a pernicketty doctor says they're no wise. But
I'd be glad to be assured, sir, that ye're no a dangerous
lunattic. If ye are, Miggle has nae business to be workin' wi'
lunattics. His hoose is no an asylum.'</p>

<p>"'I'm as sane as you are,' I said, and as shortly as I could I
told him my story. I said I was a laird on Gledwater-side--which
was true, and that my name was Brown--which wasn't. I told him
about my bet with Archie and my ride and its disastrous ending.
His face never moved a muscle; probably he didn't believe me, but
because of his political principles he wasn't going to give me
away.</p>

<p>"'Ye can bide the night with me,' he said. 'The morn we'll be
busy and ye can gang wherever ye like. It's a free country in
spite o' our God-forsaken Government.'</p>

<p>"I blessed him, and asked to whom I was indebted for this
hospitality.</p>

<p>"'I'm the Great McGowan,' he said. 'The feck o' the
pawraphernalia is on ahead. We open the morn in Kirk Aller.'</p>

<p>"He had spoken his name as if it were Mussolini or Dempsey,
one which all the world should know. I knew it too, for it had
been familiar to me from childhood. You could have seen it any
time in the last twenty years flaming upon hoardings up and down
the Lowlands--The Great McGowan's Marvellous Multitudinous
Menagerie--McGowan's Colossal Circassian Circus--The Only
Original McGowan.</p>

<p>"We rumbled on for another half-mile, and then turned from the
road into a field. As we bumped over the grass I looked out of
the door and saw about twenty big caravans and wagons at anchor.
There was a strong smell of horses and of cooking food, and above
it I seemed to detect the odour of unclean beasts. We took up our
station apart from the rest, and after the proprietor had
satisfied himself by a brief inspection that the whole outfit was
there, he announced that it was time to retire. Mr. McGowan had
apparently dined, and he did not offer me food, which I would
have welcomed, but he mixed me a rummer of hot toddy. I wondered
if it would disagree with the various medicines I had been
compelled to take, and make me very sick in the night. Then he
pointed out my bunk, undressed himself as far as his shirt,
pulled a nightcap over his venerable head, and in five minutes
was asleep. I had had a wearing day, and in spite of the
stuffiness of the place it wasn't long before I dropped off
also.</p>

<p>"I awoke next morning to find myself alone in the caravan. I
opened the window and saw that a fine old racket was going on.
The show had started to move, and as the caravans bumped over the
turf various specimens inside were beginning to give tongue. It
was going to be a gorgeous day and very hot. I was a little bit
anxious about my next move, for Kirk Aller was unpleasantly near
Craigiedean and Dr. Miggle. In the end I decided that my best
plan would be to take the train to Langshiels and there hire a
car to Larristane, after sending a telegram to say I was all
right, in case my riderless steed should turn up before me. I
hadn't any headgear, but I thought I could buy something in Kirk
Aller, and trust to luck that nobody from the Kurhaus spotted me
in the street. I wanted a bath and a shave and breakfast, but I
concluded I had better postpone them till I reached the hotel at
Langshiels.</p>

<p>"Presently Mr. McGowan appeared, and I could see by his face
that something had upset him. He was wearing an old check
dressing-gown, and he had been padding about in his bare feet on
the dewy grass.</p>

<p>"'Ye telled me a story last night, Mr. Brown,' he began
solemnly, 'which I didna altogether believe. I apologise for
being a doubting Thomas. I believe every word o't, for I've just
had confirmation.'</p>

<p>"I mumbled something about being obliged to him, and he went
on.</p>

<p>"'Ay, for the pollis were here this morning--seeking you. Yon
man at Craigiedean is terrible ill-set against ye, Mr. Brown. The
pollisman--his name's Tam Doig, I ken him fine--says they're
looking for a man that personated an inmate, and went off wi'
some o' the inmate's belongings. I'm quotin' Tam Doig. I gave Tam
an evasive answer, and he's off on his bicycle the other road,
but--I ask ye as a freend, Mr. Brown--what are precisely the
facts o' the case?'</p>

<p>"'Good God!' I said. 'It's perfectly true. These clothes I'm
wearing belong to the man Brumby, though they've got my own duds
in exchange. He must have come back after I left. What an
absolutely infernal mess! I suppose they could have me up for
theft.'</p>

<p>"'Mair like obtaining goods on false pretences, though I think
ye have a sound answer. But that's no the point, Mr. Brown. The
doctor is set on payin' off scores. Ye've entered his sawnatorium
and gone through a' the cantrips he provides, and ye've made a
gowk o' him. He wants to make an example o' <i>you.</i> Tam Doig
was sayin' that he's been bleezin' half the night on the
telephone, an' he'll no rest till ye're grippit. Now ye tell me
that ye're a laird and a man o' some poseetion, and I believe ye.
It wad be an ill job for you and your freends if ye was to appear
before the Shirra.'</p>

<p>"I did some rapid thinking. So far I was safe, for there was
nothing about the clothes I had left behind to identify me. I was
pretty certain that my horse had long ago made a bee-line for the
Larristane stables. If I could only get home without being
detected, I might regard the episode as closed.</p>

<p>"'Supposing I slip off now,' I said. 'I have a general notion
of the land, and I might get over the hills without anybody
seeing me.'</p>

<p>"He shook his head. 'Ye wouldn't travel a mile. Your
description has been circulated and a' body's lookin' for ye--a
man in a grey flannel suit and soft shoes wi' a red face and nae
hat. Guid kens what the doctor has said about ye, but the
countryside is on the look-out for a dangerous, and maybe
lunattic, criminal. There's a reward offered of nae less than
twenty pound.'</p>

<p>"'Can you not take me with you to Kirk Aller?' I asked
despairingly.</p>

<p>"'Ay, ye can stop wi' me. But what better wad ye be in Kirk
Aller? That's where the Procurator Fiscal bides.'</p>

<p>"Then he put on his spectacles and looked at me solemnly.</p>

<p>"'I've taken a fancy to ye, Mr. Brown, and ye can tell the
world that. I ask you, are ye acquaint wi' horses?'</p>

<p>"I answered that I had lived among them all my life, and had
been in the cavalry before I went into the Air Force.</p>

<p>"'I guessed it by your face. Horses have a queer trick o'
leavin' their mark on a body. Now, because I like ye, I'll make a
proposeetion to ye that I would make to no other man . . . I'm
without a ring-master. Joseph Japp, who for ten years has had the
job with me, is lyin' wi' the influenzy at Berwick. I could make
shift with Dublin Davie, but Davie has no more presence than a
messan dog, and forbye Joseph's clothes wouldna fit him. When I
cast my eyes on ye this mornin' after hearin' Tam Doig's news, I
says to mysel', "Thou art the man."'</p>

<p>"Of course I jumped at the offer. I was as safe in Kirk Aller,
as Joseph Japp's understudy, as I was in my own house. Besides, I
liked the notion; it would be a good story to tell Archie. But I
said it could only be for one night, and that I must leave
to-morrow, and he agreed. 'I want to make a good show for a start
in Kirk Aller--forbye, Joseph will be ready to join me at
Langshiels,'</p>

<p>"I borrowed the old boy's razor and had a shave and a wash,
while he was cooking breakfast. After we had fed he fetched my
predecessor's kit. It fitted me well enough, but Lord! I looked a
proper blackguard. The cord breeches had been recently cleaned,
but the boots were like a pair of dilapidated buckets, and the
coat would have made my tailor weep. Mr. McGowan himself put on a
frock-coat and a high collar and spruced himself up till he
looked exactly like one of those high-up Irish dealers you see at
the Horse Show--a cross between a Cabinet Minister and a
Methodist parson. He said the ring-master should ride beside the
chief exhibit, so we bustled out and I climbed up in front of a
wagon which bore a cage containing two very low-spirited lions. I
was given a long whip, and told to make myself conspicuous.</p>

<p>"I didn't know Kirk Aller well, so I had no fear of being
recognised either as myself or as the pseudo-Brumby. The last
time I had been there was when I had motored over from Larristane
to dine with the Aller Shooting Club. My present entry was of a
more sensational kind. I decided to enjoy myself and to attract
all the notice I could, and I certainly succeeded. Indeed, you
might say I received an ovation. As it happened it was a public
holiday, and the streets were pretty full. We rumbled up the
cobbled Westgate, and down the long High Street, with the
pavements on both sides lined with people and an attendant mob of
several hundred children. The driver was a wizened little fellow
in a jockey cap, but I was the principal figure on the box. I
gave a fine exhibition with my whip, and when we slowed down I
picked out conspicuous figures in the crowd and chaffed them. I
thought I had better use Cockney patter, as being more in keeping
with my job, and I made a happy blend of the table-talk of my
stud-groom and my old batman in the regiment. It was rather a
high-class performance and you'd be surprised how it went down.
There was one young chap with a tremendous head of hair that I
invited to join his friends in the cage, and just then one of the
dejected lions let out a growl, and I said that Mamma was calling
to her little Percy. And there was an old herd from the hills,
who had been looking upon the wine-cup, and who, in a voice like
a fog-horn, wanted to know what we fed the beasts on. Him I could
not refrain from answering in his own tongue. 'Braxy, my man,' I
cried, 'the yowes ye lost when we were fou last Boswell's Fair.'
I must have got home somehow, for the crowd roared, and his
friends thumped the old chap on the back and shouted: 'That's a
guid ane! He had you there, Tam.'</p>

<p>"My triumphant procession came to an end on the Aller Green,
where the show was to be held. A canvas palisade had been set up
round a big stretch of ground, and the mob of children tailed off
at the gate. Inside most of our truck had already arrived. The
stadium for the circus had been marked off, and tiers of wooden
seats were being hammered together. A big tent had been set up,
which was to house the menagerie, and several smaller tents were
in process of erection. I noticed that the members of the troupe
looked at me curiously till Mr. McGowan arrived and introduced
me. 'This is Mr. Brown, a friend of mine,' he said, 'who will
take on Joe Japp's job for the night.' And, aside to me, 'Man, I
heard ye comin' down the High Street. Ye did fine. Ye've a great
natural talent for the profession.' After that we were all very
friendly, and the whole company had a snack together in one of
the tents--bread and cheese and bottled beer.</p>

<p>"The first thing I did was to make a bundle of Brumby's
clothes, which Mr. McGowan promised to send back to Craigiedean
when the coast was clear. Then I bribed a small boy to take a
telegram to the Post Office--to Archie at Larristane, saying I
had been detained and hoped to return next day. After that I took
off my coat and worked like a beaver. It was nearly six o'clock
before we had everything straight, and the show opened at seven,
so we were all a bit the worse for wear when we sat down to high
tea. It's a hard job an artiste's, as old McGowan observed.</p>

<p>"I never met a queerer, friendlier, more innocent company, for
the proprietor seemed to have set out to collect originals, and
most of them had been with him for years. The boss of the
menagerie was an ex-sailor, who had a remarkable way with beasts;
he rarely spoke a word, but just grinned and whistled through
broken teeth. The clown, who said his name was Sammle Dreep, came
from Paisley, and was fat enough not to need the conventional
bolster. Dublin Davie, my second in command, was a small Irishman
who had been an ostler, and limped owing to having been with the
Dublin Fusiliers at Gallipoli. The clown had a wife who ran the
commissariat, when she wasn't appearing in the ring as Zenobia,
the Pride of the Sahara. Then there were the Sisters Wido--a
young married couple with two children; and the wife of a man who
played the clarionet--figured in the bill as Elise the
Equestrienne. I had a look at the horses, which were the ordinary
skinny, broad-backed, circus ponies. I found out later that they
were so well trained that I daresay they could have done their
turns in the dark.</p>

<p>"At a quarter to seven we lit the naphtha flares and our
orchestra started in. McGowan told me to get inside Japp's dress
clothes, and rather unwillingly I obeyed him, for I had got
rather to fancy my morning's kit. I found there was only a coat
and waistcoat, for I was allowed to retain the top-boots and
cords. Happily the shirt was clean, but I had a solitaire with a
sham diamond as big as a shilling, and the cut of the coat would
have been considered out-of-date by a self-respecting waiter in
Soho. I had also a scarlet silk handkerchief to stuff in my
bosom, a pair of dirty white kid gloves, and an immense coach
whip.</p>

<p>"The menagerie was open, but that night the chief attraction
was the circus, and I don't mind saying that about the best bit
of the circus was myself. In one of the intervals McGowan
insisted on shaking hands and telling me that I was wasted in any
other profession than a showman's. The fact is I was rather above
myself, and entered into what you might call the spirit of the
thing. We had the usual Dick Turpin's ride to York, and an escape
of Dakota Dan (one of the Sisters Wido) from Red Indians (the
other Wido, Zenobia and Elise, with about a ton of feathers on
their heads). The Equestrienne equestered, and the Widos hopped
through hoops, and all the while I kept up my patter and spouted
all the rot I could remember.</p>

<p>"The clown was magnificent. He had a Paisley accent you could
have cut like a knife, but he prided himself on talking
aristocratic English. He had a lot of badinage with Zenobia about
her life in the desert. One bit I remember. She kept on referring
to bulbuls, and asked him if he had ever seen a bull-bull. He
said he had, for he supposed it was a male coo-coo. But he was
happiest at my expense. I never heard a chap with such a flow of
back-chat. A funny thing--but when he wasn't calling me 'Little
Pansy-face,' he addressed me as 'Your Grace' and 'Me Lord Dook,'
and hoped that the audience would forgive my
n&eacute;glig&eacute; attire, seeing my coronet hadn't come back
from the wash.</p>

<p>"Altogether the thing went with a snap from beginning to end,
and when old McGowan, all dressed up with a white waistcoat, made
a speech at the end and explained about the next performances he
got a perfect hurricane of applause. After that we had to tidy
up. There was the usual trouble with several procrastinating
drunks, who wanted to make a night of it. One of them got into
the ring and tried to have a row with me. He was a big loutish
fellow with small eyes and red hair, and had the look of a
betting tout. He stuck his face close to mine and bellowed at
me:</p>

<p>"'I ken ye fine, ye ----! I seen ye at Lanerick last back-end.
. . . Ye ca'd yoursel' Gentleman Geordie, and ye went off wi' my
siller. By God, I'll get it out o' ye, ye ---- welsher.'</p>

<p>"I told him that he was barking up the wrong tree, and that I
was not a bookie and had never been near Lanerick, but he refused
to be convinced. The upshot was that Davie and I had to chuck him
out, blaspheming like a navvy and swearing that he was coming
back with his pals to do me in.</p>

<p>"We were a very contented lot of mountebanks at supper that
night. The takings were good and the menagerie also had been
popular, and we all felt that we had been rather above our form.
McGowan, for whom I was acquiring a profound affection, beamed on
us, and produced a couple of bottles of blackstrap to drink the
health of the Colossal Circassian Circus. That old fellow was a
nonesuch. He kept me up late--for I stopped with him in his
caravan--expounding his philosophy of life. It seemed he had been
intended for the kirk, but had had too much <i>joie de vivre</i>
for the pulpit. He was a born tramp, and liked waking up most
days in a new place, and he loved his queer outfit and saw the
comedy of it. 'For three and thirty years I've travelled the
country,' he said, 'and I've been a public benefactor, Mr. Brown.
I've put colour into many a dowie life, and I've been a godsend
to the bairns. There's no vulgarity in my performances--they're
a' as halesome as spring water.' He quoted Burns a bit, and then
he got on to politics, for he was a great Radical, and maintained
that Scotland was about the only true democracy, because a man
was valued precisely for what he was and no more. 'Ye're a laird,
Mr. Brown, but ye're a guid fellow, and this night ye've shown
yourself to be a man and a brither. What do you and me care for
mawgnates? We take no stock in your Andra Carnegies and your
Dukes o' Burminster.' And as I dropped off to sleep he was
obliging with a verse of 'A man's a man for a' that.'</p>

<p>"I woke in excellent spirits, thinking what a good story I
should have to tell when I returned to Larristane. My plan was to
get off as soon as possible, take the train to Langshiels, and
then hire. I could see that McGowan was sorry to part with me,
but he agreed that it was too unhealthy a countryside for me to
dally in. There was to be an afternoon performance, so everybody
had to hustle, and there was no reason for me to linger. After
breakfast I borrowed an old ulster from him, for I had to cover
up my finery, and a still older brown bowler to replace the
topper I had worn on the preceding day.</p>

<p>"Suddenly we heard a fracas, and the drunk appeared who had
worried me the night before. He had forced his way in and was
pushing on through an expostulating crowd. When he saw me he made
for me with a trail of blasphemy. He was perfectly sober now and
looked very ugly.</p>

<p>"'Gie me back my siller,' he roared. 'Gie me back the
five-pund note I won at Lanerick when I backed Kettle o' Fish.'
If I hadn't warded him off he would have taken me by the
throat.</p>

<p>"I protested again that he was mistaken, but I might as well
have appealed to a post. He swore with every variety of oath that
I was Gentleman Geordie, and that I had levanted with his
winnings. As he raved I began to see a possible explanation of
his madness. Some bookmaker, sporting my sort of kit, had
swindled him. I had ridden several times in steeplechases at
Lanerick and he had seen me and got my face in his head, and
mixed me up with the fraudulent bookie.</p>

<p>"It was a confounded nuisance, and but for the principle of
the thing I would have been inclined to pay up. As it was we had
to fling him out, and he went unwillingly, doing all the damage
he could. His parting words were that he and his pals weren't
done with me, and that though he had to wait fifty years he would
wring my neck.</p>

<p>"After that I thought I had better waste no time, so I said
good-bye to McGowan and left the show-ground by the back entrance
close to the Aller. I had a general notion of the place, and knew
that if I kept down the river I could turn up a lane called the
Water Wynd, and get to the station without traversing any of the
main streets. I had ascertained that there was a train at 10.30
which would get me to Langshiels at 11.15, so that I could be at
Larristane for luncheon.</p>

<p>"I had underrated the persistence of my enemy. He and his pals
had picketed all the approaches to the show, and when I turned
into the Water Wynd I found a fellow there, who at the sight of
me blew a whistle. In a second or two he was joined by three
others, among them my persecutor.</p>

<p>"'We've gotten ye noo,' he shouted, and made to collar me.</p>

<p>"'If you touch me,' I said, 'it's assault, and a case for the
police.'</p>

<p>"'That's your game, is it?' he cried. 'Na, na, we'll no
trouble the pollis. They tell me the Law winna help me to recover
a bet, so I'll just trust to my nieves. Will ye pay up, ye ----,
or take the bloodiest bashin' ye ever seen?'</p>

<p>"I was in an uncommon nasty predicament. There was nobody in
the Wynd but some children playing, and the odds were four to
one. If I fought I'd get licked. The obvious course of safety was
to run up the Wynd towards the High Street, where I might find
help. But that would mean a street row and the intervention of
the police, a case in court, and the disclosure of who I was. If
I broke through and ran back to McGowan I would be no farther
forward. What was perfectly clear was that I couldn't make the
railway station without landing myself in the worst kind of
mess.</p>

<p>"There wasn't much time to think, for the four men were upon
me. I hit out at the nearest, saw him go down, and then doubled
up the Wynd and into a side alley on the right.</p>

<p>"By the mercy of Providence this wasn't a cul-de-sac, but
twisted below the old walls of the burgh, and then became a lane
between gardens. The pursuit was fairly hot, and my accursed
boots kept slipping on the cobbles and cramped my form. They were
almost upon me before I reached the lane, but then I put on a
spurt, and was twenty yards ahead when it ended in a wall with a
gate. The gate was locked, but the wall was low, and I scrambled
over it, and dropped into the rubbish heap of a garden.</p>

<p>"There was no going back, so I barged through some gooseberry
bushes, skirted a lawn, squattered over a big square of gravel,
and charged through the entrance gates of a suburban villa. My
enemies plainly knew a better road, for when I passed the
entrance they were only a dozen yards off on my left. That
compelled me to turn to the right, the direction away from Kirk
Aller. I was now on a highway where I could stretch myself, and
it was not long before I shook off the pursuit. They were
whiskyfied ruffians and not much good in a hunt. It was a warm
morning, but I did not slacken till I had put a good quarter of a
mile between us. I saw them come round a turn, lumbering along,
cooked to the world, so I judged that I could slow down to an
easy trot.</p>

<p>"I was cut off from my lines of communication, and the only
thing to do was to rejoin them by a detour. The Aller valley,
which the railway to Langshiels followed, gave me a general
direction. I remembered that about six miles off there was a
station called Rubersdean, and that there was an afternoon train
which got to Langshiels about three o'clock. I preferred to pick
it up there, for I didn't mean to risk showing my face inside
Kirk Aller again.</p>

<p>"By this time I had got heartily sick of my adventures. Being
chased like a fox is amusing enough for an hour or two, but it
soon palls. I was becoming a regular outlaw--wanted by the police
for breaking into a nursing-home and stealing a suit, and very
much wanted by various private gentlemen on the charge of
bilking. Everybody's hand seemed to be against me, except old
McGowan's, and I had had quite enough of it. I wanted nothing so
much as to be back at Larristane, and I didn't believe I would
tell Archie the story, for I was fed up with the whole
business.</p>

<p>"I didn't dare go near a public-house, and the best I could do
for luncheon was a bottle of ginger-beer and some biscuits which
I bought at a sweetie-shop. To make a long story short, I reached
Rubersdean in time, and as there were several people on the
platform I waited till the train arrived before showing myself. I
got into a third-class carriage at the very end of it.</p>

<p>"The only occupants were a woman and a child, and my
appearance must have been pretty bad, for the woman looked as if
she wanted to get out when she saw me. But I said it was a fine
day and "guid for the crops," and I suppose she was reassured by
my Scotch tongue, for she quieted down. The child was very
inquisitive, and they discussed me in whispers. 'What's that man,
Mamaw?' it asked. 'Never mind, Jimmie.' 'But I want to ken,
Mamaw.' 'Wheesht, dearie. He's a crool man. He kills the wee
mawpies.' At that the child set up a howl, but I felt rather
flattered, for a rabbit-trapper was a respectable profession
compared to those with which I had recently been credited.</p>

<p>"At the station before Langshiels they collect the tickets. I
had none, so when the man came round I could only offer a Bank of
England five-pound note. He looked at it very suspiciously, asked
me rudely if I had nothing smaller, consulted the station-master,
and finally with a very ill grace got me change out of the
latter's office. This hung up the train for a good five minutes,
and you could see by their looks that they thought I was a thief.
The thing had got so badly on my nerves that I could have wept. I
counted the minutes till we reached Langshiels, and I was not
cheered by the behaviour of my travelling companion. She was
clearly convinced of the worst, and when we came out of a tunnel
she was jammed into the farthest corner, clutching her child and
her bag, and looking as if she had escaped from death. I can tell
you it was a thankful man that shot out on to the platform at
Langshiels. . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"I found myself looking into the absolutely bewildered eyes of
Tommy Deloraine. . . . I saw a lot of fellows behind him with
rosettes and scared faces, and I saw what looked like a band. . .
.</p>

<p>"It took me about a hundredth part of a second to realise that
I had dropped out of the frying-pan into the fire. You will
scarcely believe it, but since I had rehearsed my speech going up
the Rinks burn, the political meeting at Langshiels had gone
clean out of my head. I suppose I had tumbled into such an
utterly new world that no link remained with the old one. And as
my foul luck would have it, I had hit on the very train by which
I had told Deloraine I would travel.</p>

<p>"'For heaven's sake, Tommy, tell me where I can change,' I
hissed. 'Lend me some clothes or I'll murder you.'</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>"Well, that was the end of it. I got into a suit of Tommy's at
the Station Hotel--luckily he was about my size--and we proceeded
with the brass band and the rosetted committee to the Town Hall.
I made a dashed good speech, though I say it who shouldn't,
simply because I was past caring what I did. Life had been rather
too much for me the last two days."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Burminster finished his tankard, and a light of reminiscence
came into his eye.</p>

<p>"Last week," he said, "I was passing Buckingham Palace. One of
the mallards from St. James's Park had laid away, and had hatched
out a brood somewhere up Constitution Hill. The time had come
when she wanted to get the ducklings back to the water. There was
a big crowd, and through the midst of it marched two bobbies with
the mother-duck between them, while the young ones waddled
behind. I caught the look in her eye, and, if you believe me, it
was the comicalest mixture of relief and embarrassment, shyness,
self-consciousness and desperation.</p>

<p>"I would like to have shaken hands with that bird. I knew
exactly how she felt."</p>

<h1><i>JOHN PALLISER-YEATES'S STORY</i></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain; therefore
they went their way as a flock.--<i>Zechariah</i> x. 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>In the early spring Palliser-Yeates had 'flu, and had it so
badly that he was sent to recruit for a fortnight on the Riviera.
There, being profoundly bored, he wrote out and sent to us this
story. He would not give the name of the chief figure, because he
said he was still a serving soldier, and his usefulness, he
hoped, was not exhausted. The manuscript arrived opportunely, for
some of us had just been trying, without success, to extract from
Sandy Arbuthnot the truth of certain of his doings about which
rumour had been busy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">I</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the second week of January 1917, a modest brass plate
appeared on a certain door in Regent Street, among modistes and
hat-makers and vendors of cosmetics. It bore the name of Dr. S.
Lartius. On the third floor were the rooms to which the plate was
the signpost, a pleasant set, newly decorated with powder-blue
wallpapers, curtains of orange velveteen, and sham marqueterie.
The milliners' girls who frequented that staircase might have
observed, about eleven in the morning, the figure of Dr. Lartius
arriving. They did not see him leave, for they had flown to their
suburban homes long before the key turned of an evening in the
doctor's door.</p>

<p>He was a slim young man of the middle height, who held himself
straighter than the usual run of sedentary folk. His face was
very pale, and his mop of hair and fluffy beard were black as
jet. He wore large tortoiseshell spectacles, and, when he removed
them, revealed slightly protuberant and very bright hazel eyes,
which contrasted oddly with his pallor. Had such a figure
appeared on the stage, the gallery experts, familiar with stage
villains, would have unhesitatingly set him down as the anarchist
from Moscow about to assassinate the oppressive nobleman and
thereby give the hero his chance. But his clothes were far too
good for that part. He wore a shiny top-hat and an expensive fur
coat, and his neat morning coat, fine linen, unobtrusive black
tie and pearl pin suggested the high finance rather than the
backstairs of revolution.</p>

<p>It appeared that Dr. Lartius did a flourishing business.
Suddenly London had begun to talk about him. First there were the
people that matter, the people who are ever on the hunt for a new
sensation and must always be in the first flight of any fad. Lady
A told the Duchess of B about a wonderful new man who really had
Power--no ordinary vulgar spiritualist, but a true Seeker and
Thinker. Mr. D, that elderly gossip, carried the story through
many circles, and it grew with the telling. The curious began to
cultivate Dr. Lartius, and soon the fame of him came to the ears
of those who were not curious, only anxious or broken-hearted;
and because the last were a great multitude, and were ready to
give their all for consolation, there was a busy coming and going
all day on Dr. Lartius's staircase.</p>

<p>His way with his clients was interesting. He had no single
method of treatment, and varied his manner according to the
motives of the inquirer. The merely inquisitive he entertained
with toys. "I am no professor of an art," he told them
laughingly. "I am a student, groping on the skirts of great
mysteries." And to the more intelligent he would propound an
illustration. "Take the mathematics of the Fourth Dimension," he
would say. "I can show you a few simple mechanical puzzles, which
cannot be explained except by the aid of abstruse mathematics,
and not always then. But these puzzles tell you nothing about the
Fourth Dimension, except that there is a world about us
inexplicable on the rule of three dimensions. It is the same with
my toys--my crystal ball, my pool of ink, my star-maps, even
those superinduced moods of abstraction in which we seem to hear
the noise of wings and strange voices. They only tell me that
there is more in earth and heaven than is dreamed of in man's
philosophy."</p>

<p>But his toys were wonderful. The idle ladies who went there
for a thrill were not disappointed. In the dusky room, among the
strange rosy lights, their hearts seemed to be always fluttering
on the brink of a revelation, and they came away excited and
comforted, for Dr. Lartius was an adept at delicate flattery.
Fortune-telling in the ordinary sense there was none, but this
young man seemed to have an uncanny knowledge of private affairs,
which he used so discreetly that even those who had most reason
to desire secrecy were never disquieted. For such entertainments
he charged fees--high fees, as the fur coat and the pearl pin
required. "You wish to be amused," he would say, "and it is right
that you should pay me for it."</p>

<p>Even among the idle clients there was a sprinkling of the
earnest. With these he had the air of a master towards initiates;
they were fellow-pilgrims with him on the Great Road. He would
talk to them by the hour, very beautifully, in a soft musical
voice. He would warn them against charlatans, those who sought to
prostitute a solemn ritual to purposes of vulgar gain. He would
unroll for them the history of the great mystics and tell of that
secret science known to the old adepts, which had been lost for
ages, and was now being recovered piecemeal. These were the most
thrilling hours of all, and the fame of Dr. Lartius grew great in
the drawing-rooms of the Elect. "And he's such a gentleman, my
dear--so well-bred and sympathetic and unworldly and absolutely
honest!"</p>

<p>But from others he took no fees. The sad-faced women, mostly
in black, who sat in his great velvet chair and asked broken
questions, found a very different Dr. Lartius. He was no longer
fluent and silver-tongued; sometimes he seemed almost
embarrassed. He would repeat most earnestly that he was only a
disciple, a seeker, not a master of hidden things. On such
occasions the toys were absent, and if some distracted mother
sought knowledge that way she was refused. He rarely had anything
definite to impart. When Lady H.'s only son was about to exchange
from the cavalry to the Foot Guards and his mother wanted to know
how the step would affect his chances of survival, she got
nothing beyond the obvious remark that this was an infantry war
and he would have a better prospect of seeing fighting. Very
rarely, he spoke out. Once to Mrs. K., whose boy was a prisoner,
he gave a very full account of life in a German prison-camp, so
that, in the absence of letters, her imagination had henceforth
something to bite on. Usually his visitors were too embarrassed
to be observant, but one or two noted that he was uncommonly well
informed about the British Army. He never made a mistake about
units, and seemed to know a man's battalion before he was told
it. And when mothers poured out details to him--for from the talk
of soldiers on leave and epistolary indiscretions a good deal of
information circulated about London--he now and then took
notes.</p>

<p>Yet, though they got little from him that was explicit, these
visitors, as a rule, went away comforted. Perhaps it was his
gentle soothing manner. Perhaps, as poor Lady M. said, it was
that he seemed so assured of the spiritual life that they felt
that their anxieties were only tiny eddies on the edge of a great
sea of peace. At any rate, it was the afflicted even more than
the idly curious who spoke well of Dr. Lartius.</p>

<p>Sometimes he had masculine clients--fathers of fighting sons,
who said they came on their wives' behalf, elderly retired
Generals who preferred spiritualism to golf, boys whose nerves
were in tatters and wanted the solace which in other ages and
lands would have been found in the confessional. With these last
Dr. Lartius became a new man. He would take off his spectacles
and look them in the face with his prominent lustrous eyes, and
talk to them with a ring in his pleasant voice. It was not what
he said so much, perhaps, as his manner of saying it, but he
seemed to have a singular power over boys just a little bit loose
from their moorings. "Queer thing," said one of these, "but one
would almost think you had been a soldier yourself." Dr. Lartius
had smiled and resumed his spectacles. "I am a soldier, but in a
different war. I fight with the sword of the spirit against the
hidden things of darkness."</p>

<p>Towards the end of March the brass plate suddenly disappeared.
There was a great fluttering in the dovecotes of the Elect when
the news went round that there had been trouble with the police.
It had been over the toys, of course, and the taking of fees. The
matter never came into court, but Dr. Lartius had been warned to
clear out, and he obeyed. Many ladies wrote indignant letters to
the Home Secretary about persecution, letters which cited ominous
precedents from the early history of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>But in April came consolation. The rumour spread that the
Seekers were not to lose their guide. Mr. Greatheart would still
be available for the comforting of pilgrims. A plate with the
name of Dr. S. Lartius reappeared in a quiet street in Mayfair.
But for the future there would be no question of fees. It was
generally assumed that a few devout women had provided a fund for
the sustenance of the prophet.</p>

<p>In May his fame was greater than ever. One evening Lady
Samplar, the most ardent of his devotees, spoke of him to a
certain General who was a power in the land. The General was
popular among the women of her set, but a notorious scoffer.
Perhaps this was the secret of his popularity, for each hoped to
convert him.</p>

<p>"I want you to see him yourself," she said. "Only once. I
believe in him so firmly that I am willing to stake everything on
one interview. Promise me you will let me take you. I only want
you to see him and talk to him for ten minutes. I want you to
realise his unique personality, for if you once <i>feel</i> him
you will scoff no more."</p>

<p>The General laughed, shrugged his shoulders, but allowed
himself to be persuaded. So it came about that one afternoon in
early June he accompanied Lady Samplar to the flat in Mayfair.
"You must go in alone," she told him in the anteroom. "I have
spoken about you to him, and he is expecting you. I will wait for
you here."</p>

<p>For half an hour the General was closeted with Dr. Lartius.
When he returned to the lady his face was red and wrathful.</p>

<p>"That's the most dangerous fellow in London," he declared.
"Look here, Mollie, you and your friends have been playing the
fool about that man. He's a German spy, if there ever was one. I
caught him out, for I trapped him into speaking German. You say
he's a Swiss, but I swear no Swiss ever spoke German just as he
speaks it. The man's a Bavarian. I'll take my oath he is!"</p>

<p>It was a very depressed and rather frightened lady who gave
him tea a little later in her drawing-room.</p>

<p>"That kind of sweep is far too clever for you innocents," she
was told. "There he has been for months pumping you all without
your guessing it. You say he's a great comfort to the mourners. I
daresay he is, but the poor devils tell him everything that's in
their heads. That man has a unique chance of knowing the inside
of the British Army. And how has he used his knowledge? That's
what I want to know."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" she quavered.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have him laid by the heels," he said grimly, as
he took his departure. "Interned--or put up against a wall, if we
can get the evidence. I tell you he's a Boche pure and
simple--not that there's much purity and simplicity about
him."</p>

<p>The General was as good as his word, but in one matter he was
wrong. The credentials of the prophet's Swiss nationality were
good enough. There was nothing for it but to deport him as an
undesirable, so one fine morning Dr. S. Lartius got his marching
orders. He made no complaint, and took a dignified farewell of
his friends. But the Faithful were not silent, and the friendship
between Lady Samplar and the General died a violent death. The
thing got into the papers, Dr. Lartius figured in many
unrecognisable portraits in the press, and a bishop preached a
sermon in a City church about the worship of false gods.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">II</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As Dr. Lartius, closely supervised by the French police,
pursued his slow and comfortless journey to the Swiss frontier,
he was cheered by several proofs that his fame had gone abroad
and that he was not forgotten. At Paris there were flowers in his
dingy hotel bedroom, the gift of an unknown admirer, and a little
note of encouragement in odd French. At Dijon he received from a
strange lady another note telling him that his friends were
awaiting him in Berne. When he crossed the border at Pontarlier
there were more flowers and letters. The young man paid little
attention to such tributes. He spent the journey in quiet reading
and meditation, and when he reached Berne did not seem to expect
anyone to greet him, but collected his luggage and drove off
unobtrusively to an hotel.</p>

<p>He had not been there an hour when a card was brought to him
bearing the name of Ernst Ulrici, Doctor of Philosophy in the
University of Bonn.</p>

<p>"Dr. Lartius," said the visitor, a middle-aged man with a
peaked grey beard and hair cut <i>en brosse</i>. "It is an honour
to make your acquaintance. We have heard of your fine work and
your world-moulding discoveries."</p>

<p>The young man bowed gravely. "I am only a seeker," he said. "I
make no claim to be a master--yet. I am only a little way on the
road to enlightenment."</p>

<p>"We have also heard," said the other, "of how shamelessly the
British Government has persecuted learning in your person."</p>

<p>The reply was a smile and a shrug. "I make no complaint. It is
natural that my studies should seem foolishness to the children
of this world."</p>

<p>Dr. Ulrici pressed him further on the matter of Britain, but
could wake no bitterness.</p>

<p>"There is war to-day," he said at last. "You are of German
race. Your sympathies are with us?"</p>

<p>"I have no nationality," was the answer. "All men are my
brothers. But I would fain see this bloodshed at an end."</p>

<p>"How will it end?" came the question.</p>

<p>"I am no prophet," said Dr. Lartius. "Yet I can tell that
Germany will win, but how I can tell I cannot tell."</p>

<p>The conversation lasted long and explored many subjects. The
German led it cunningly to small matters, and showed a wide
acquaintance with the young man's science. He learned that much
of his work had been done with soldiers and soldiers' kin, and
that in the process of it he had heard many things not published
in the newspapers. But when he hinted, ever so delicately, that
he would be glad to buy the knowledge, a flush passed over the
other's pale face and his voice sharpened.</p>

<p>"I am no spy," he said. "I do not prostitute my art for hire.
It matters nothing to me which side wins, but it matters much
that I keep my soul clean."</p>

<p>So Dr. Ulrici tried another tack. He spoke of the mysteries of
the craft, and lured the young man into the confession of hopes
and ideals. There could be no communion with the dead, he was
told, until communion had first been perfected with the spirits
of the living. "Let the time come," said Dr. Lartius, "when an
unbroken fellowship can be created between souls separated by
great tracts of space, and the key has been found. Death is an
irrelevant accident. The spirit is untouched by it. Find the
<i>trait d'union</i> between spirits still in their fleshly
envelope, and it can be continued when that envelope is
shed."</p>

<p>"And you have progressed in this affair?" asked Ulrici, with
scepticism in his tone.</p>

<p>"A few stages," said the other, and in the ardour of
exposition he gave proofs. He had clients, he said, with whom he
had established the mystic <i>catena.</i> He could read their
thoughts even now, though they were far away, share in their
mental changes, absorb the knowledge which they acquired.</p>

<p>"Soldiers?" asked the German.</p>

<p>"Some were soldiers. All were the kin of soldiers."</p>

<p>But Ulrici was still cold. "That is a great marvel," he said,
"and not easy to believe."</p>

<p>Dr. Lartius was fired. "I will give you proofs," he said, with
unwonted passion in his voice. "You can test them at your
leisure. I know things which have not yet come to pass, though no
man has spoken to me of them. How do I know them? Because they
have come within the cognisance of minds attuned to my own."</p>

<p>For a moment he seemed to hesitate. Then he spoke of certain
matters--a little change in the method of artillery barrages, a
readjustment in the organisation of the British Air Force, an
alteration in certain British commands.</p>

<p>"These may be trivial things," he said. "I do not know. I have
no technical skill. But they are still in the future. I offer
them to you as proofs of my knowledge."</p>

<p>"So?" said the other. "They are indeed small things, but they
will do for a test. . . ."</p>

<p>Then he spoke kindly, considerately, of Dr. Lartius's
future.</p>

<p>"I think I will go to Munich," said the young man. "Once I
studied at the University there, and I love the bright city. They
are a sympathetic people and respect knowledge."</p>

<p>Dr. Ulrici rose to take his leave. "It may be I am able to
further your plans, my friend," he said.</p>

<p>Late that night in a big sitting-room in another hotel,
furnished somewhat in the style of an official bureau, Ulrici
talked earnestly with another man, a heavy, bearded man, who wore
the air of a prosperous bagman, but who was addressed with every
token of respect.</p>

<p>"This Lartius fellow puzzles me. He is a transparent fanatic,
with some odd power in him that sets him above others of his
kidney. I fear he will not be as useful to us as we had hoped. If
only we had known of him sooner and could have kept him in
England."</p>

<p>"He can't go back, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Impossible, sir. But there is still a chance. He has some
wild theory that he has established a link with various people,
and so acquires automatically whatever new knowledge they gain.
Some of these people are soldiers. He has told me things--little
things--that I may test this power of his. I am no believer in
the spiritualist mumbo-jumbo, but I have lived long enough not to
reject a thing because it is new and strange. About that we shall
see. If there is anything in it there will be much. Meantime I
keep closely in touch with him."</p>

<p>"What is he going to do?"</p>

<p>"He wants to go to Munich. I am in favour of permitting it,
sir. Our good Bavarians are somewhat light in the head, and are
always seeking a new thing. They want a little ghostly
consolation at present, and this man will give it them. He
believes most firmly in our German victory."</p>

<p>The other yawned and flung away the end of his cigar. "The
mountebank seems to have some glimmerings of sense," he said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">III</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So it came about that in August of the year 1917 Dr. Lartius
was settled in comfortable rooms off the Garmischstrasse in the
Bavarian capital, and a new plate of gun-metal and oxidised
silver, lettered in the best style of <i>art nouveau,</i>
advertised his name to the citizens of Munich.</p>

<p>Fortune still attended the young man, for, as in London, he
seemed to spring at once into fame. Within a week of his arrival
people were talking about him, and in a month his chambers were
crowded. Perhaps his friend Ulrici had spoken a word in the right
place. It was the great season before Caporetto, and Dr. Lartius
spoke heartening things to his clients. Victory was near and the
days of glory; but when asked about the date of peace he was coy.
Peace would come, but not yet; for the world there was another
winter of war.</p>

<p>His methods were the same as those which had captured Lady
Samplar and her friends. To the idly curious he showed toys; to
the emotional he spoke nobly of the life of the spirit and the
locked doors of hidden knowledge which were now almost ajar. Rich
ladies, bored with the dullness of the opera season and the
scarcity of men, found in him a new interest in life. To the
sorrowful he gave the comfort which he had given to his London
circle--no more. His personality seemed to exhale hope and
sympathy, and mourners, remembering his pleasant voice and
compelling eyes, departed with a consolation which they could not
define.</p>

<p>That was for the ordinary run of clients; but there were
others--fellow-students they professed themselves--to whom he
gave stronger meat. He preached his doctrine of the mystic
community of thought and knowledge between souls far apart, and
now and then he gave proofs such as he had given to Ulrici. It
would appear that these proofs stood the test, for his reputation
grew prodigiously. He told them little things about forthcoming
changes in the Allied armies, and the event always proved him
right. They were not things that mattered greatly, but if he
could disclose trivialities some day his method might enable him
to reveal a mighty secret. So more than one
<i>Generalstabschef</i> came to sit with him in his twilit
room.</p>

<p>About once a month he used to go back to Berne, and was
invariably met at the station by Ulrici. He had been given a very
special passport, which took him easily and expeditiously over
the frontier, and he had no trouble with station commandants. In
these visits he would be closeted with Ulrici for hours.
Occasionally he would slip out of his hotel at night for a
little, and when Ulrici heard of it he shrugged his shoulders and
laughed. "He is young," he would say with a leer. "Even a prophet
must have his amusements." But he was wrong, for Dr. Lartius had
not the foibles he suspected.</p>

<p>The winter passed slowly, and the faces in the Munich streets
grew daily more pinched and wan, clothing more shabby and boots
more down at heel. But there was always comfort for seekers in
the room in the Garmischstrasse. Whoever lost faith it was not
Dr. Lartius. Peace was coming, and his hearers judged that he had
forgotten his scientific detachment from all patriotisms and was
becoming a good German.</p>

<p>Then in February of the New Year came the rumour of the great
advance preparing in the West. The High Command had promised
speedy and final victory in return for a little more endurance.
Dr. Lartius seemed to have the first news of it. "It is Peace,"
he said, "Peace before winter"; and his phrase was repeated
everywhere and became a popular watchword. So, when the news came
at the end of March of the retreat of the French and English to
the gates of Amiens, the hungry people smiled to each other and
said, "He is right, as always. It is Peace." Few now cared much
about victory, except the high officers and the very rich, but on
Peace all were determined.</p>

<p>April passed into May, and ere the month was out came glorious
tidings. Ludendorff had reached the Marne, and was within range
of Paris. About this time his closest disciples marked a change
in Dr. Lartius. He seemed to retire into himself, and to be
struggling with some vast revelation. His language was less
intelligible, but far more impressive. Ulrici came up from Berne
to see him, for he had stopped for some months his visits to
Switzerland. There were those who said his health was breaking,
others that he was now, in very truth, looking inside the veil.
This latter was the general view, and the fame of the young man
became a superstition.</p>

<p>"You tell us little now about our enemies," Ulrici
complained.</p>

<p><i>"Mystica catena rupta est,"</i> Dr. Lartius quoted sadly.
"My friends are your enemies, and they are suffering. Their
hearts and nerves are breaking. Therefore the link is thin and I
cannot feel their thoughts. That is why I am so sad, for against
my will the sorrow of my friends clouds me."</p>

<p>Ulrici laughed in his gross way. "Then the best omen for us is
that you fall into melancholia? When you cut your throat we shall
know that we have won."</p>

<p>Yet Ulrici was not quite happy. The young prophet was in
danger of becoming a Frankenstein's monster, which he could not
control. For his popular fame was now a thing to marvel at. It
had gone abroad through Germany, and to all the fighting fronts,
and the phrase linked to it was that of "Peace before winter."
Peace had become a conviction, an obsession. Ulrici and his
friends would have preferred the word to be "Victory."</p>

<p>In the early days of July a distinguished visitor came from
Berlin to the Garmischstrasse. He was an <i>Erster
Generalstabsoffizier,</i> high in the confidence of the Supreme
Command. He sat in the shaded room and asked an urgent
question.</p>

<p>"I am not a Delphian oracle," said Dr. Lartius, "and I do not
prophesy. But this much I can tell you. The hearts of your
enemies have become like water, and they have few reserves left.
I am not a soldier, so you can judge better than I. You say you
are ready to strike with a crushing force. If you leave your
enemies leisure they will increase and their hearts may
recover."</p>

<p>"That is my view," said the soldier. "You have done much for
the German people in the past, sir. Have you no word now to
encourage them?"</p>

<p>"There will be peace before winter. This much I can tell, but
how I know I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"But on what terms?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon your armies," was the oracular reply.</p>

<p>The staff officer had been gazing intently at the speaker. Now
he rose and switched on the electric light.</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me by taking off your glasses, sir?" he
asked, and there was the sharpness of command in his voice.</p>

<p>Dr. Lartius removed his spectacles, and for some seconds the
two men looked at each other.</p>

<p>"I thank you," said the soldier at last. "For a moment I
thought we had met before. You reminded me of a man I knew long
ago. I was mistaken."</p>

<p>After that it was noted by all that the melancholy of Dr.
Lartius increased. His voice was saddened, and dejection wrapped
him like a cloud. Those of the inner circle affected to see in
this a good omen. "He is <i>en rapport</i> with his English
friends," they said. "He cannot help himself, and their despair
is revealed in him. The poor Lartius! He is suffering for the
sins of our enemies." But the great public saw only the
depression, and as August matured, and bad news filtered through
the land, it gave their spirits an extra push downhill.</p>

<p>In those weeks only one word came from the Garmischstrasse. It
was "Peace--peace before winter." The phrase became the universal
formula whispered wherever people spoke their minds. It ran like
lightning through the camps and along the fronts, and in every
workshop and tavern. It became a passion, a battle-cry. The Wise
Doctor of Munich had said it. Peace before winter--Peace at all
costs--only Peace.</p>

<p>In September Ulrici was in communication with a certain bureau
in Berlin. "The man is honest enough, but he is mad. He has
served his purpose. It is time to suppress him." Berlin agreed,
and one morning Ulrici departed from Berne.</p>

<p>But when he reached the Garmischstrasse he found the
flamboyant plate unscrewed from the door and the pleasant rooms
deserted.</p>

<p>For a day or two before Dr. Lartius had been behaving oddly.
He gave out that he was ill, and could not receive, but he was
very busy indoors with his papers. Then late one evening, after a
conversation on the telephone with the railway people, he left
his rooms, with no luggage but a small dressing-case, and took
the night train for Innsbruck. His admirable passport franked him
anywhere. From Innsbruck he travelled to the Swiss frontier, and
when he crossed it, in the darkness of the September evening and
in an empty carriage, he made a toilet which included the shaving
of his silky black beard. He was whistling softly and seemed to
have recovered his spirits. At Berne he did not seek his usual
hotel, but went to an unfrequented place in a back street, where,
apparently, he was well known. There he met during the course of
the day various people, and their conversation was not in the
German tongue.</p>

<p>That night he again took train, but it was westward to
Lausanne and the French border.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>IV</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In the early days of November, when the Allies were
approaching Maubeuge and Sedan, and the German plenipotentiaries
were trying to dodge the barrage and get speech with Foch, two
British officers were sitting in a little room at Versailles. One
was the General we have already met, the quondam friend of Lady
Samplar. The other was a slim young man who wore the badges of a
lieutenant-colonel and the gorget patches of the staff. He had a
pale face shaven clean, black hair cut very short, and curious,
bright, protuberant hazel eyes. He must have seen some service,
for he had two rows of medal ribbons on his breast.</p>

<p>"Unarm, Eros," quoted the General, looking at the last slip on
a pile of telegrams. "'The long day's task is done.' It has been
a grim business, and, Tommy, my lad, I think you had the most
difficult patch of the lot to hoe. . . . It was largely due to
you that the Boche made his blunder on 15th July, and stretched
his neck far enough to let Foch hit him."</p>

<p>The young man grinned. "I wouldn't like to go through it
again, sir. But it didn't seem so bad when I was at it, though it
is horrible to look back on. The worst part was the
loneliness."</p>

<p>"You must have often had bad moments."</p>

<p>"Not so many. I only remember two as particularly gruesome.
One was when I heard you slanging me to Lady Samplar, and I
suddenly felt hopelessly cut off from my kind. . . . The other
was in July, when von Mudra came down from Berlin to see me. He
dashed nearly spotted me, for he was at the Embassy when I was in
Constantinople."</p>

<p>The General lifted a flamboyant plate whereon the name of Dr.
S. Lartius was inscribed in letters of oxidised silver. "You've
brought away your souvenir all right. I suppose you'll have it
framed as a trophy for your ancestral hall. By the way, what did
the letter S stand for?"</p>

<p>"When I was asked," said the young man, "I said 'Sigismund.'
But I really meant it for 'Spurius'--the chap, you remember, who
held the bridge with Horatius."</p>

<p>Nightingale was a hard man to draw. His doings with the
Bedawin had become a legend, but he would as soon have talked
about them as claimed to have won the War. He was a slim dark
fellow about thirty-five years of age, very short-sighted, and
wearing such high-powered double glasses that it was impossible
to tell the colour of his eyes. This weakness made him stoop a
little and peer, so that he was the strangest figure to picture
in a burnous leading an army of desert tribesmen. I fancy his
power came partly from his oddness, for his followers thought
that the hand of Allah had been laid on him, and partly from his
quick imagination and his flawless courage. After the War he had
gone back to his Cambridge fellowship, declaring that, thank God,
that chapter in his life was over.</p>

<p>As I say, he never mentioned the deeds which had made him
famous. He knew his own business, and probably realised that to
keep his mental balance he had to drop the curtain on what must
have been the most nerve-racking four years ever spent by man. We
respected his decision and kept off Arabia. It was a remark of
Hannay's that drew from him the following story. Hannay was
talking about his Cotswold house, which was on the Fosse Way, and
saying that it always puzzled him how so elaborate a civilisation
as Roman Britain could have been destroyed utterly and left no
mark on the national history beyond a few roads and ruins and
place-names. Peckwether, the historian, demurred, and had a good
deal to say about how much the Roman tradition was woven into the
Saxon culture. "Rome only sleeps," he said; "she never dies."</p>

<p>Nightingale nodded. "Sometimes she dreams in her sleep and
talks. Once she scared me out of my senses."</p>

<p>After a good deal of pressing he produced this story. He was
not much of a talker, so he wrote it out and read it to us.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There is a place in Shropshire which I do not propose to visit
again. It lies between Ludlow and the hills, in a shallow valley
full of woods. Its name is St. Sant, a village with a big house
and park adjoining, on a stream called the Vaun, about five miles
from the little town of Faxeter. They have queer names in those
parts, and other things queerer than the names.</p>

<p>I was motoring from Wales to Cambridge at the close of the
long vacation. All this happened before the War, when I had just
got my fellowship and was settling down to academic work. It was
a fine night in early October, with a full moon, and I intended
to push on to Ludlow for supper and bed. The time was about
half-past eight, the road was empty and good going, and I was
trundling pleasantly along when something went wrong with my
headlights. It was a small thing, and I stopped to remedy it
beyond a village and just at the lodge-gates of a house.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the road a carrier's cart had drawn
up, and two men, who looked like indoor servants, were lifting
some packages from it on to a big barrow. The moon was up, so I
didn't need the feeble light of the carrier's lamp to see what
they were doing. I suppose I wanted to stretch my legs for a
moment, for when I had finished my job I strolled over to them.
They did not hear me coming, and the carrier on his perch seemed
to be asleep.</p>

<p>The packages were the ordinary consignments from some big shop
in town. But I noticed that the two men handled them very
gingerly, and that, as each was laid in the barrow, they clipped
off the shop label and affixed one of their own. The new labels
were odd things, large and square, with some address written on
them in very black capital letters. There was nothing in that,
but the men's faces puzzled me. For they seemed to do their job
in a fever, longing to get it over and yet in a sweat lest they
should make some mistake. Their commonplace task seemed to be for
them a matter of tremendous importance. I moved so as to get a
view of their faces, and I saw that they were white and strained.
The two were of the butler or valet class, both elderly, and I
could have sworn that they were labouring under something like
fear.</p>

<p>I shuffled my feet to let them know of my presence and
remarked that it was a fine night. They started as if they had
been robbing a corpse. One of them mumbled something in reply,
but the other caught a package which was slipping, and in a tone
of violent alarm growled to his mate to be careful. I had a
notion that they were handling explosives.</p>

<p>I had no time to waste, so I pushed on. That night, in my room
at Ludlow, I had the curiosity to look up my map and identify the
place where I had seen the men. The village was St. Sant, and it
appeared that the gate I had stopped at belonged to a
considerable demesne called Vauncastle. That was my first
visit.</p>

<p>At that time I was busy on a critical edition of Theocritus,
for which I was making a new collation of the manuscripts. There
was a variant of the Medicean Codex in England, which nobody had
seen since Gaisford, and after a good deal of trouble I found
that it was in the library of a man called Dubellay. I wrote to
him at his London club, and got a reply to my surprise from
Vauncastle Hall, Faxeter. It was an odd letter, for you could see
that he longed to tell me to go to the devil, but couldn't quite
reconcile it with his conscience. We exchanged several letters,
and the upshot was that he gave me permission to examine his
manuscript. He did not ask me to stay, but mentioned that there
was a comfortable little inn in St. Sant.</p>

<p>My second visit began on the 27th of December, after I had
been home for Christmas. We had had a week of severe frost, and
then it had thawed a little; but it remained bitterly cold, with
leaden skies that threatened snow. I drove from Faxeter, and as
we ascended the valley I remember thinking that it was a
curiously sad country. The hills were too low to be impressive,
and their outlines were mostly blurred with woods; but the tops
showed clear, funny little knolls of grey bent that suggested a
volcanic origin. It might have been one of those backgrounds you
find in Italian primitives, with all the light and colour left
out. When I got a glimpse of the Vaun in the bleached meadows it
looked like the "wan water" of the Border ballads. The woods,
too, had not the friendly bareness of English copses in
wintertime. They remained dark and cloudy, as if they were hiding
secrets. Before I reached St. Sant, I decided that the landscape
was not only sad, but ominous.</p>

<p>I was fortunate in my inn. In the single street of one-storied
cottages it rose like a lighthouse, with a cheery glow from
behind the red curtains of the bar parlour. The inside proved as
good as the outside. I found a bedroom with a bright fire, and I
dined in a wainscoted room full of preposterous old pictures of
lanky hounds and hollow-backed horses. I had been rather
depressed on my journey, but my spirits were raised by this
comfort, and when the house produced a most respectable bottle of
port I had the landlord in to drink a glass. He was an ancient
man who had been a gamekeeper, with a much younger wife, who was
responsible for the management. I was curious to hear something
about the owner of my manuscript, but I got little from the
landlord. He had been with the old squire, and had never served
the present one. I heard of Dubellays in plenty--the landlord's
master, who had hunted his own hounds for forty years, the Major
his brother, who had fallen at Abu Klea; Parson Jack, who had had
the living till he died, and of all kinds of collaterals. The
"Deblays" had been a high-spirited, open-handed stock, and much
liked in the place. But of the present master of the Hall he
could or would tell me nothing. The Squire was a "great
scholard," but I gathered that he followed no sport and was not a
convivial soul like his predecessors. He had spent a mint of
money on the house, but not many people went there. He, the
landlord, had never been inside the grounds in the new master's
time, though in the old days there had been hunt breakfasts on
the lawn for the whole countryside, and mighty tenantry dinners.
I went to bed with a clear picture in my mind of the man I was to
interview on the morrow. A scholarly and autocratic recluse, who
collected treasures and beautified his dwelling and probably
lived in his library. I rather looked forward to meeting him, for
the bonhomous sporting squire was not much in my line.</p>

<p>After breakfast next morning I made my way to the Hall. It was
the same leaden weather, and when I entered the gates the air
seemed to grow bitterer and the skies darker. The place was
muffled in great trees which even in their winter bareness made a
pall about it. There was a long avenue of ancient sycamores,
through which one caught only rare glimpses of the frozen park. I
took my bearings, and realised that I was walking nearly due
south, and was gradually descending. The house must be in a
hollow. Presently the trees thinned, I passed through an iron
gate, came out on a big untended lawn, untidily studden with
laurels and rhododendrons, and there before me was the house
front.</p>

<p>I had expected something beautiful--an old Tudor or Queen Anne
fa&ccedil;ade or a dignified Georgian portico. I was
disappointed, for the front was simply mean. It was low and
irregular, more like the back parts of a house, and I guessed
that at some time or another the building had been turned round,
and the old kitchen door made the chief entrance. I was confirmed
in my conclusion by observing that the roofs rose in tiers, like
one of those recessed New York sky-scrapers, so that the present
back parts of the building were of an impressive height.</p>

<p>The oddity of the place interested me, and still more its
dilapidation. What on earth could the owner have spent his money
on? Everything--lawn, flower-beds, paths--was neglected. There
was a new stone doorway, but the walls badly needed pointing, the
window woodwork had not been painted for ages, and there were
several broken panes. The bell did not ring, so I was reduced to
hammering on the knocker, and it must have been ten minutes
before the door opened. A pale butler, one of the men I had seen
at the carrier's cart the October before, stood blinking in the
entrance.</p>

<p>He led me in without question, when I gave my name, so I was
evidently expected. The hall was my second surprise. What had
become of my picture of the collector? The place was small and
poky, and furnished as barely as the lobby of a farm-house. The
only thing I approved was its warmth. Unlike most English country
houses there seemed to be excellent heating arrangements.</p>

<p>I was taken into a little dark room with one window that
looked out on a shrubbery, while the man went to fetch his
master. My chief feeling was of gratitude that I had not been
asked to stay, for the inn was paradise compared with this
sepulchre. I was examining the prints on the wall, when I heard
my name spoken and turned round to greet Mr. Dubellay.</p>

<p>He was my third surprise. I had made a portrait in my mind of
a fastidious old scholar, with eye-glasses on a black cord, and a
finical <i>weltkind</i>-ish manner. Instead I found a man still
in early middle age, a heavy fellow dressed in the roughest
country tweeds. He was as untidy as his demesne, for he had not
shaved that morning, his flannel collar was badly frayed, and his
fingernails would have been the better for a scrubbing brush. His
face was hard to describe. It was high-coloured, but the colour
was not healthy; it was friendly, but it was also wary; above
all, it was <i>unquiet.</i> He gave me the impression of a man
whose nerves were all wrong, and who was perpetually on his
guard.</p>

<p>He said a few civil words, and thrust a badly tied brown paper
parcel at me.</p>

<p>"That's your manuscript," he said jauntily.</p>

<p>I was staggered. I had expected to be permitted to collate the
codex in his library, and in the last few minutes had realised
that the prospect was distasteful. But here was this casual owner
offering me the priceless thing to take away.</p>

<p>I stammered my thanks, and added that it was very good of him
to trust a stranger with such a treasure.</p>

<p>"Only as far as the inn," he said. "I wouldn't like to send it
by post. But there's no harm in your working at it at the inn.
There should be confidence among scholars." And he gave an odd
cackle of a laugh.</p>

<p>"I greatly prefer your plan," I said. "But I thought you would
insist on my working at it here."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," he said earnestly. "I shouldn't think of such a
thing. . . . Wouldn't do at all. . . . An insult to our
freemasonry. . . . That's how I should regard it."</p>

<p>We had a few minutes' further talk. I learned that he had
inherited under the entail from a cousin, and had been just over
ten years at Vauncastle. Before that he had been a London
solicitor. He asked me a question or two about Cambridge--wished
he had been at the University--much hampered in his work by a
defective education. I was a Greek scholar?--Latin, too, he
presumed. Wonderful people the Romans. . . . He spoke quite
freely, but all the time his queer restless eyes were darting
about, and I had a strong impression that he would have liked to
say something to me very different from these commonplaces--that
he was longing to broach some subject but was held back by
shyness or fear. He had such an odd appraising way of looking at
me.</p>

<p>I left without his having asked me to a meal, for which I was
not sorry, for I did not like the atmosphere of the place. I took
a short cut over the ragged lawn, and turned at the top of the
slope to look back. The house was in reality a huge pile, and I
saw that I had been right and that the main building was all at
the back. Was it, I wondered, like the Alhambra, which behind a
front like a factory concealed a treasure-house? I saw, too, that
the woodland hollow was more spacious than I had fancied. The
house, as at present arranged, faced due north, and behind the
south front was an open space in which I guessed that a lake
might lie. Far beyond I could see in the December dimness the
lift of high dark hills.</p>

<p>That evening the snow came in earnest, and fell continuously
for the better part of two days. I banked up the fire in my
bedroom and spent a happy time with the codex. I had brought only
my working books with me and the inn boasted no library, so when
I wanted to relax I went down to the tap-room, or gossiped with
the landlady in the bar parlour. The yokels who congregated in
the former were pleasant fellows, but, like all the folk on the
Marches, they did not talk readily to a stranger and I heard
little from them of the Hall. The old squire had reared every
year three thousand pheasants, but the present squire would not
allow a gun to be fired on his land and there were only a few
wild birds left. For the same reason the woods were thick with
vermin. This they told me when I professed an interest in
shooting. But of Mr. Dubellay they would not speak, declaring
that they never saw him. I daresay they gossiped wildly about
him, and their public reticence struck me as having in it a touch
of fear.</p>

<p>The landlady, who came from a different part of the shire, was
more communicative. She had not known the former Dubellays and so
had no standard of comparison, but she was inclined to regard the
present squire as not quite right in the head. "They do say," she
would begin, but she, too, suffered from some inhibition, and
what promised to be sensational would tail off into the
commonplace. One thing apparently puzzled the neighbourhood above
others, and that was his rearrangement of the house. "They do
say," she said in an awed voice, "that he have built a great
church." She had never visited it--no one in the parish had, for
Squire Dubellay did not allow intruders--but from Lyne Hill you
could see it through a gap in the woods. "He's no good
Christian," she told me, "and him and Vicar has quarrelled this
many a day. But they do say as he worships summat there." I
learned that there were no women servants in the house, only the
men he had brought from London. "Poor benighted souls, they must
live in a sad hobble," and the buxom lady shrugged her shoulders
and giggled.</p>

<p>On the last day of December I decided that I needed exercise
and must go for a long stride. The snow had ceased that morning,
and the dull skies had changed to a clear blue. It was still very
cold, but the sun was shining, the snow was firm and crisp
underfoot, and I proposed to survey the country. So after
luncheon I put on thick boots and gaiters, and made for Lyne
Hill. This meant a considerable circuit, for the place lay south
of the Vauncastle park. From it I hoped to get a view of the
other side of the house.</p>

<p>I was not disappointed. There was a rift in the thick
woodlands, and below me, two miles off, I suddenly saw a strange
building, like a classical temple. Only the entablature and the
tops of the pillars showed above the trees, but they stood out
vivid and dark against the background of snow. The spectacle in
that lonely place was so startling that for a little I could only
stare. I remember that I glanced behind me to the snowy line of
the Welsh mountains, and felt that I might have been looking at a
winter view of the Apennines two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>My curiosity was now alert, and I determined to get a nearer
view of this marvel. I left the track and ploughed through the
snowy fields down to the skirts of the woods. After that my
troubles began. I found myself in a very good imitation of a
primeval forest, where the undergrowth had been unchecked and the
rides uncut for years. I sank into deep pits, I was savagely torn
by briars and brambles, but I struggled on, keeping a line as
best I could. At last the trees stopped. Before me was a flat
expanse which I knew must be a lake, and beyond rose the
temple.</p>

<p>It ran the whole length of the house, and from where I stood
it was hard to believe that there were buildings at its back
where men dwelt. It was a fine piece of work--the first glance
told me that--admirably proportioned, classical, yet not
following exactly any of the classical models. One could imagine
a great echoing interior dim with the smoke of sacrifice, and it
was only by reflecting that I realised that the peristyle could
not be continued down the two sides, that there was no interior,
and that what I was looking at was only a portico.</p>

<p>The thing was at once impressive and preposterous. What
madness had been in Dubellay when he embellished his house with
such a grandiose garden front? The sun was setting and the shadow
of the wooded hills darkened the interior, so I could not even
make out the back wall of the porch. I wanted a nearer view, so I
embarked on the frozen lake.</p>

<p>Then I had an odd experience. I was not tired, the snow lay
level and firm, but I was conscious of extreme weariness. The
biting air had become warm and oppressive. I had to drag boots
that seemed to weigh tons across that lake. The place was utterly
silent in the stricture of the frost, and from the pile in front
no sign of life came.</p>

<p>I reached the other side at last and found myself in a frozen
shallow of bulrushes and skeleton willow-herbs. They were taller
than my head, and to see the house I had to look upward through
their snowy traceries. It was perhaps eighty feet above me and a
hundred yards distant, and, since I was below it, the delicate
pillars seemed to spring to a great height. But it was still
dusky, and the only detail I could see was on the ceiling, which
seemed either to be carved or painted with deeply-shaded
monochrome figures.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dying sun came slanting through the gap in the
hills, and for an instant the whole portico to its farthest
recesses was washed in clear gold and scarlet. That was wonderful
enough, but there was something more. The air was utterly still
with not the faintest breath of wind--so still that when I had
lit a cigarette half an hour before the flame of the match had
burned steadily upward like a candle in a room. As I stood among
the sedges not a single frost crystal stirred. . . . But there
was a wind blowing in the portico.</p>

<p>I could see it lifting feathers of snow from the base of the
pillars and fluffing the cornices. The floor had already been
swept clean, but tiny flakes drifted on to it from the exposed
edges. The interior was filled with a furious movement, though a
yard from it was frozen peace. I felt nothing of the action of
the wind, but I knew that it was hot, hot as the breath of a
furnace.</p>

<p>I had only one thought, dread of being overtaken by night near
that place. I turned and ran. Ran with labouring steps across the
lake, panting and stifling with a deadly hot oppression, ran
blindly by a sort of instinct in the direction of the village. I
did not stop till I had wrestled through the big wood, and come
out on some rough pasture above the highway. Then I dropped on
the ground, and felt again the comforting chill of the December
air.</p>

<p>The adventure left me in an uncomfortable mood. I was ashamed
of myself for playing the fool, and at the same time hopelessly
puzzled, for the oftener I went over in my mind the incidents of
that afternoon the more I was at a loss for an explanation. One
feeling was uppermost, that I did not like this place and wanted
to be out of it. I had already broken the back of my task, and by
shutting myself up for two days I completed it; that is to say, I
made my collation as far as I had advanced myself in my
commentary on the text. I did not want to go back to the Hall, so
I wrote a civil note to Dubellay, expressing my gratitude and
saying that I was sending up the manuscript by the landlord's
son, as I scrupled to trouble him with another visit.</p>

<p>I got a reply at once, saying that Mr. Dubellay would like to
give himself the pleasure of dining with me at the inn before I
went, and would receive the manuscript in person.</p>

<p>It was the last night of my stay in St. Sant, so I ordered the
best dinner the place could provide, and a magnum of claret, of
which I discovered a bin in the cellar. Dubellay appeared
promptly at eight o'clock, arriving to my surprise in a car. He
had tidied himself up and put on a dinner jacket, and he looked
exactly like the city solicitors you see dining in the Junior
Carlton.</p>

<p>He was in excellent spirits, and his eyes had lost their air
of being on guard. He seemed to have reached some conclusion
about me, or decided that I was harmless. More, he seemed to be
burning to talk to me. After my adventure I was prepared to find
fear in him, the fear I had seen in the faces of the
men-servants. But there was none; instead there was excitement,
overpowering excitement.</p>

<p>He neglected the courses in his verbosity. His coming to
dinner had considerably startled the inn, and instead of a maid
the landlady herself waited on us. She seemed to want to get the
meal over, and hustled the biscuits and the port on to the table
as soon as she decently could. Then Dubellay became
confidential.</p>

<p>He was an enthusiast, it appeared, an enthusiast with a single
hobby. All his life he had pottered among antiquities, and when
he succeeded to Vauncastle he had the leisure and money to
indulge himself. The place, it seemed, had been famous in Roman
Britain--Vauni Castra--and Faxeter was a corruption of the same.
"Who was Vaunus?" I asked. He grinned, and told me to wait.</p>

<p>There had been an old temple up in the high woods. There had
always been a local legend about it, and the place was supposed
to be haunted. Well, he had had the site excavated and he had
found--Here he became the cautious solicitor, and explained to me
the law of treasure trove. As long as the objects found were not
intrinsically valuable, not gold or jewels, the finder was
entitled to keep them. He had done so--had not published the
results of his excavations in the proceedings of any learned
society--did not want to be bothered by tourists. I was
different, for I was a scholar.</p>

<p>What had he found? It was really rather hard to follow his
babbling talk, but I gathered that he had found certain carvings
and sacrificial implements. And--he sunk his voice--most
important of all, an altar, an altar of Vaunus, the tutelary
deity of the vale. When he mentioned this word his face took on a
new look--not of fear but of secrecy, a kind of secret
excitement. I have seen the same look on the face of a
street-preaching Salvationist.</p>

<p>Vaunus had been a British god of the hills, whom the Romans in
their liberal way appear to have identified with Apollo. He gave
me a long confused account of him, from which it appeared that
Mr. Dubellay was not an exact scholar. Some of his derivations of
place-names were absurd--like St. Sant from Sancta Sanctorum--and
in quoting a line of Ausonius he made two false quantities. He
seemed to hope that I could tell him something more about Vaunus,
but I said that my subject was Greek, and that I was deeply
ignorant about Roman Britain. I mentioned several books, and
found that he had never heard of Haverfield.</p>

<p>One word he used, "hypocaust," which suddenly gave me a clue.
He must have heated the temple, as he heated his house, by some
very efficient system of hot air. I know little about science,
but I imagined that the artificial heat of the portico, as
contrasted with the cold outside, might create an air current. At
any rate that explanation satisfied me, and my afternoon's
adventure lost its uncanniness. The reaction made me feel
friendly towards him, and I listened to his talk with sympathy,
but I decided not to mention that I had visited his temple.</p>

<p>He told me about it himself in the most open way. "I couldn't
leave the altar on the hillside," he said. "I had to make a place
for it, so I turned the old front of the house into a sort of
temple. I got the best advice, but architects are ignorant
people, and I often wished I had been a better scholar. Still the
place satisfies me."</p>

<p>"I hope it satisfies Vaunus," I said jocularly.</p>

<p>"I think so," he replied quite seriously, and then his
thoughts seemed to go wandering, and for a minute or so he looked
through me with a queer abstraction in his eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you do with it now you've got it?" I asked.</p>

<p>He didn't reply, but smiled to himself.</p>

<p>"I don't know if you remember a passage in Sidonius
Apollinaris," I said, "a formula for consecrating pagan altars to
Christian uses. You begin by sacrificing a white cock or
something suitable, and tell Apollo with all friendliness that
the old dedication is off for the present. Then you have a
Christian invocation--"</p>

<p>He nearly jumped out of his chair.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't do--wouldn't do at all! . . . Oh Lord, no! . .
. Couldn't think of it for one moment!"</p>

<p>It was as if I had offended his ears by some horrid blasphemy,
and the odd thing was that he never recovered his composure. He
tried, for he had good manners, but his ease and friendliness had
gone. We talked stiffly for another half-hour about trifles, and
then he rose to leave. I returned him his manuscript neatly
parcelled up, and expanded in thanks, but he scarcely seemed to
heed me. He stuck the thing in his pocket, and departed with the
same air of shocked absorption.</p>

<p>After he had gone I sat before the fire and reviewed the
situation. I was satisfied with my hypocaust theory, and had no
more perturbation in my memory about my afternoon's adventure.
Yet a slight flavour of unpleasantness hung about it, and I felt
that I did not quite like Dubellay. I set him down as a crank who
had tangled himself up with a half-witted hobby, like an old maid
with her cats, and I was not sorry to be leaving the place.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>My third and last visit to St. Sant was in the following
June--the midsummer of 1914. I had all but finished my
Theocritus, but I needed another day or two with the Vauncastle
manuscript, and, as I wanted to clear the whole thing off before
I went to Italy in July, I wrote to Dubellay and asked if I might
have another sight of it. The thing was a bore, but it had to be
faced, and I fancied that the valley would be a pleasant place in
that hot summer.</p>

<p>I got a reply at once, inviting, almost begging me to come,
and insisting that I should stay at the Hall. I couldn't very
well refuse, though I would have preferred the inn. He wired
about my train, and wired again saying he would meet me. This
time I seemed to be a particularly welcome guest.</p>

<p>I reached Faxeter in the evening, and was met by a car from a
Faxeter garage. The driver was a talkative young man, and, as the
car was a closed one, I sat beside him for the sake of fresh air.
The term had tired me, and I was glad to get out of stuffy
Cambridge, but I cannot say that I found it much cooler as we
ascended the Vaun valley. The woods were in their summer
magnificence but a little dulled and tarnished by the heat, the
river was shrunk to a trickle, and the curious hill-tops were so
scorched by the sun that they seemed almost yellow above the
green of the trees. Once again I had the feeling of a landscape
fantastically un-English.</p>

<p>"Squire Dubellay's been in a great way about your coming,
sir," the driver informed me. "Sent down three times to the boss
to make sure it was all right. He's got a car of his own, too, a
nice little Daimler, but he don't seem to use it much. Haven't
seen him about in it for a month of Sundays."</p>

<p>As we turned in at the Hall gates he looked curiously about
him. "Never been here before, though I've been in most
gentlemen's parks for fifty miles round. Rum old-fashioned spot,
isn't it, sir?"</p>

<p>If it had seemed a shuttered sanctuary in midwinter, in that
June twilight it was more than ever a place enclosed and guarded.
There was almost an autumn smell of decay, a dry decay like
touchwood. We seemed to be descending through layers of
ever-thickening woods. When at last we turned through the iron
gate I saw that the lawns had reached a further stage of neglect,
for they were as shaggy as a hayfield.</p>

<p>The white-faced butler let me in, and there, waiting at his
back, was Dubellay. But he was not the man whom I had seen in
December. He was dressed in an old baggy suit of flannels, and
his unwholesome red face was painfully drawn and sunken. There
were dark pouches under his eyes, and these eyes were no longer
excited, but dull and pained. Yes, and there was more than pain
in them--there was fear. I wondered if his hobby were becoming
too much for him.</p>

<p>He greeted me like a long-lost brother. Considering that I
scarcely knew him, I was a little embarrassed by his warmth.
"Bless you for coming, my dear fellow," he cried. "You want a
wash and then we'll have dinner. Don't bother to change, unless
you want to. I never do." He led me to my bedroom, which was
clean enough but small and shabby like a servant's room. I
guessed that he had gutted the house to build his absurd
temple.</p>

<p>We dined in a fair-sized room which was a kind of library. It
was lined with old books, but they did not look as if they had
been there long; rather it seemed like a lumber room in which a
fine collection had been stored. Once no doubt they had lived in
a dignified Georgian chamber. There was nothing else, none of the
antiques which I had expected.</p>

<p>"You have come just in time," he told me. "I fairly jumped
when I got your letter, for I had been thinking of running up to
Cambridge to insist on your coming down here. I hope you're in no
hurry to leave."</p>

<p>"As it happens," I said, "I <i>am</i> rather pressed for time,
for I hope to go abroad next week. I ought to finish my work here
in a couple of days. I can't tell you how much I'm in your debt
for your kindness."</p>

<p>"Two days," he said. "That will get us over midsummer. That
should be enough." I hadn't a notion what he meant.</p>

<p>I told him that I was looking forward to examining his
collection. He opened his eyes. "Your discoveries, I mean," I
said, "the altar of Vaunus . . ."</p>

<p>As I spoke the words his face suddenly contorted in a spasm of
what looked like terror. He choked and then recovered himself.
"Yes, yes," he said rapidly. "You shall see it--you shall see
everything--but not now--not to-night. Tomorrow--in broad
daylight--that's the time."</p>

<p>After that the evening became a bad dream. Small talk deserted
him, and he could only reply with an effort to my commonplaces. I
caught him often looking at me furtively, as if he were sizing me
up and wondering how far he could go with me. The thing fairly
got on my nerves, and to crown all it was abominably stuffy. The
windows of the room gave on a little paved court with a
background of laurels, and I might have been in Seven Dials for
all the air there was.</p>

<p>When coffee was served I could stand it no longer. "What about
smoking in the temple?" I said. "It should be cool there with the
air from the lake."</p>

<p>I might have been proposing the assassination of his mother.
He simply gibbered at me. "No, no," he stammered. "My God, no!"
It was half an hour before he could properly collect himself. A
servant lit two oil lamps, and we sat on in the frowsty room.</p>

<p>"You said something when we last met," he ventured at last,
after many a sidelong glance at me. "Something about a ritual for
re-dedicating an altar."</p>

<p>I remembered my remark about Sidonius Apollinaris.</p>

<p>"Could you show me the passage? There is a good classical
library here, collected by my great-grandfather. Unfortunately my
scholarship is not equal to using it properly."</p>

<p>I got up and hunted along the shelves, and presently found a
copy of Sidonius, the Plantin edition of 1609. I turned up the
passage, and roughly translated it for him. He listened hungrily
and made me repeat it twice.</p>

<p>"He says a cock," he hesitated. "Is that essential?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. I fancy any of the recognised ritual stuff
would do."</p>

<p>"I am glad," he said simply. "I am afraid of blood."</p>

<p>"Good God, man," I cried out, "are you taking my nonsense
seriously? I was only chaffing. Let old Vaunus stick to his
altar!"</p>

<p>He looked at me like a puzzled and rather offended dog.</p>

<p>"Sidonius was in earnest . . ."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not," I said rudely. "We're in the twentieth
century and not in the third. Isn't it about time we went to
bed?"</p>

<p>He made no objection, and found me a candle in the hall. As I
undressed I wondered into what kind of lunatic asylum I had
strayed. I felt the strongest distaste for the place, and longed
to go straight off to the inn; only I couldn't make use of a
man's manuscripts and insult his hospitality. It was fairly clear
to me that Dubellay was mad. He had ridden his hobby to the death
of his wits and was now in its bondage. Good Lord! he had talked
of his precious Vaunus as a votary talks of a god. I believed he
had come to worship some figment of his half-educated fancy.</p>

<p>I think I must have slept for a couple of hours. Then I woke
dripping with perspiration, for the place was simply an oven. My
window was as wide open as it would go, and, though it was a warm
night, when I stuck my head out the air was fresh. The heat came
from indoors. The room was on the first floor near the entrance
and I was looking on to the overgrown lawns. The night was very
dark and utterly still, but I could have sworn that I heard wind.
The trees were as motionless as marble, but somewhere close at
hand I heard a strong gust blowing. Also, though there was no
moon, there was somewhere near me a steady glow of light; I could
see the reflection of it round the end of the house. That meant
that it came from the temple. What kind of saturnalia was
Dubellay conducting at such an hour?</p>

<p>When I drew in my head I felt that if I was to get any sleep
something must be done. There could be no question about it; some
fool had turned on the steam heat, for the room was a furnace. My
temper was rising. There was no bell to be found, so I lit my
candle and set out to find a servant.</p>

<p>I tried a cast downstairs and discovered the room where we had
dined. Then I explored a passage at right angles, which brought
me up against a great oak door. The light showed me that it was a
new door, and that there was no apparent way of opening it. I
guessed that it led into the temple, and, though it fitted close
and there seemed to be no key-hole, I could hear through it a
sound like a rushing wind. . . . Next I opened a door on my right
and found myself in a big store cupboard. It had a funny, exotic,
spicy smell, and, arranged very neatly on the floor and shelves,
was a number of small sacks and coffers. Each bore a label, a
square of stout paper with very black lettering. I read <i>"Pro
servitio Vauni."</i></p>

<p>I had seen them before, for my memory betrayed me if they were
not the very labels that Dubellay's servants had been attaching
to the packages from the carrier's cart that evening in the past
autumn. The discovery made my suspicions an unpleasant certainty.
Dubellay evidently meant the labels to read "For the service of
Vaunus." He was no scholar, for it was an impossible use of the
word "servitium," but he was very patently a madman.</p>

<p>However, it was my immediate business to find some way to
sleep, so I continued my quest for a servant. I followed another
corridor, and discovered a second staircase. At the top of it I
saw an open door and looked in. It must have been Dubellay's, for
his flannels were tumbled untidily on a chair, but Dubellay
himself was not there and the bed had not been slept in.</p>

<p>I suppose my irritation was greater than my alarm--though I
must say I was getting a little scared--for I still pursued the
evasive servant. There was another stair which apparently led to
attics, and in going up it I slipped and made a great clatter.
When I looked up the butler in his nightgown was staring down at
me, and if ever a mortal face held fear it was his. When he saw
who it was he seemed to recover a little.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said, "for God's sake turn off that infernal
hot air. I can't get a wink of sleep. What idiot set it
going?"</p>

<p>He looked at me owlishly, but he managed to find his
tongue.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, "but there is no heating
apparatus in this house."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said. I returned to my bedroom
and it seemed to me that it had grown cooler. As I leaned out of
the window, too, the mysterious wind seemed to have died away,
and the glow no longer showed from beyond the corner of the
house. I got into bed and slept heavily till I was roused by the
appearance of my shaving water about half-past nine. There was no
bathroom, so I bathed in a tin pannikin.</p>

<p>It was a hazy morning which promised a day of blistering heat.
When I went down to breakfast I found Dubellay in the
dining-room. In the daylight he looked a very sick man, but he
seemed to have taken a pull on himself, for his manner was
considerably less nervy than the night before. Indeed, he
appeared almost normal, and I might have reconsidered my view but
for the look in his eyes.</p>

<p>I told him that I proposed to sit tight all day over the
manuscript, and get the thing finished. He nodded. "That's all
right. I've a lot to do myself, and I won't disturb you."</p>

<p>"But first," I said, "you promised to show me your
discoveries."</p>

<p>He looked at the window where the sun was shining on the
laurels and on a segment of the paved court.</p>

<p>"The light is good," he said--an odd remark. "Let us go there
now. There are times and seasons for the temple."</p>

<p>He led me down the passage I had explored the previous night.
The door opened not by a key but by some lever in the wall. I
found myself looking suddenly at a bath of sunshine with the lake
below as blue as a turquoise.</p>

<p>It is not easy to describe my impressions of that place. It
was unbelievably light and airy, as brilliant as an Italian
colonnade in midsummer. The proportions must have been good, for
the columns soared and swam, and the roof (which looked like
cedar) floated as delicately as a flower on its stalk. The stone
was some local limestone, which on the floor took a polish like
marble. All around was a vista of sparkling water and summer
woods and far blue mountains. It should have been as wholesome as
the top of a hill.</p>

<p>And yet I had scarcely entered before I knew that it was a
prison. I am not an imaginative man, and I believe my nerves are
fairly good, but I could scarcely put one foot before the other,
so strong was my distaste. I felt shut off from the world, as if
I were in a dungeon or on an ice-floe. And I felt, too, that
though far enough from humanity, we were not alone.</p>

<p>On the inner wall there were three carvings. Two were
imperfect friezes sculptured in low-relief, dealing apparently
with the same subject. It was a ritual procession, priests
bearing branches, the ordinary <i>dendrophori</i> business. The
faces were only half-human, and that was from no lack of skill,
for the artist had been a master. The striking thing was that the
branches and the hair of the hierophants were being tossed by a
violent wind, and the expression of each was of a being in the
last stage of endurance, shaken to the core by terror and
pain.</p>

<p>Between the friezes was a great roundel of a Gorgon's head. It
was not a female head, such as you commonly find, but a male
head, with the viperous hair sprouting from chin and lip. It had
once been coloured, and fragments of a green pigment remained in
the locks. It was an awful thing, the ultimate horror of fear,
the last dementia of cruelty made manifest in stone. I hurriedly
averted my eyes and looked at the altar.</p>

<p>That stood at the west end on a pediment with three steps. It
was a beautiful piece of work, scarcely harmed by the centuries,
with two words inscribed on its face--APOLL. VAUN. It was made of
some foreign marble, and the hollow top was dark with ancient
sacrifices. Not so ancient either, for I could have sworn that I
saw there the mark of recent flame.</p>

<p>I do not suppose I was more than five minutes in the place. I
wanted to get out, and Dubellay wanted to get me out. We did not
speak a word till we were back in the library.</p>

<p>"For God's sake give it up!" I said. "You're playing with
fire, Mr. Dubellay. You're driving yourself into Bedlam. Send
these damned things to a museum and leave this place. Now, now, I
tell you. You have no time to lose. Come down with me to the inn
straight off and shut up this house."</p>

<p>He looked at me with his lip quivering like a child about to
cry.</p>

<p>"I will. I promise you I will. . . . But not yet. . . . After
to-night. . . . To-morrow I'll do whatever you tell me. . . . You
won't leave me?"</p>

<p>"I won't leave you, but what earthly good am I to you if you
won't take my advice?"</p>

<p>"Sidonius . . ." he began.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn Sidonius! I wish I had never mentioned him. The
whole thing is arrant nonsense, but it's killing you. You've got
it on the brain. Don't you know you're a sick man?"</p>

<p>"I'm not feeling very grand. It's so warm to-day. I think I'll
lie down."</p>

<p>It was no good arguing with him, for he had the appalling
obstinacy of very weak things. I went off to my work in a
shocking bad temper.</p>

<p>The day was what it had promised to be, blisteringly hot.
Before midday the sun was hidden by a coppery haze, and there was
not the faintest stirring of wind. Dubellay did not appear at
luncheon--it was not a meal he ever ate, the butler told me. I
slogged away all the afternoon, and had pretty well finished my
job by six o'clock. That would enable me to leave next morning,
and I hoped to be able to persuade my host to come with me.</p>

<p>The conclusion of my task put me into a better humour, and I
went for a walk before dinner. It was a very close evening, for
the heat haze had not lifted; the woods were as silent as a
grave, not a bird spoke, and when I came out of the cover to the
burnt pastures the sheep seemed too languid to graze. During my
walk I prospected the environs of the house, and saw that it
would be very hard to get access to the temple except by a long
circuit. On one side was a mass of outbuildings, and then a high
wall, and on the other the very closest and highest quickset
hedge I have ever seen, which ended in a wood with savage spikes
on its containing wall. I returned to my room, had a cold bath in
the exiguous tub, and changed.</p>

<p>Dubellay was not at dinner. The butler said that his master
was feeling unwell and had gone to bed. The news pleased me, for
bed was the best place for him. After that I settled myself down
to a lonely evening in the library. I browsed among the shelves
and found a number of rare editions which served to pass the
time. I noticed that the copy of Sidonius was absent from its
place.</p>

<p>I think it was about ten o'clock when I went to bed, for I was
unaccountably tired. I remember wondering whether I oughtn't to
go and visit Dubellay, but decided that it was better to leave
him alone. I still reproach myself for that decision. I know now
I ought to have taken him by force and haled him to the inn.</p>

<p>Suddenly I came out of heavy sleep with a start. A human cry
seemed to be ringing in the corridors of my brain. I held my
breath and listened. It came again, a horrid scream of panic and
torture.</p>

<p>I was out of bed in a second, and only stopped to get my feet
into slippers. The cry must have come from the temple. I tore
downstairs expecting to hear the noise of an alarmed household.
But there was no sound, and the awful cry was not repeated.</p>

<p>The door in the corridor was shut, as I expected. Behind it
pandemonium seemed to be loose, for there was a howling like a
tempest--and something more, a crackling like fire. I made for
the front door, slipped off the chain, and found myself in the
still, moonless night. Still, except for the rending gale that
seemed to be raging in the house I had left.</p>

<p>From what I had seen on my evening's walk I knew that my one
chance to get to the temple was by way of the quickset hedge. I
thought I might manage to force a way between the end of it and
the wall. I did it, at the cost of much of my raiment and my
skin. Beyond was another rough lawn set with tangled shrubberies,
and then a precipitous slope to the level of the lake. I
scrambled along the sedgy margin, not daring to lift my eyes till
I was on the temple steps.</p>

<p>The place was brighter than day with a roaring blast of fire.
The very air seemed to be incandescent and to have become a
flaming ether. And yet there were no flames--only a burning
brightness. I could not enter, for the waft from it struck my
face like a scorching hand and I felt my hair singe. . . .</p>

<p>I am short-sighted, as you know, and I may have been mistaken,
but this is what I think I saw. From the altar a great tongue of
flame seemed to shoot upwards and lick the roof, and from its
pediment ran flaming streams. In front of it lay a
body--Dubellay's--a naked body, already charred and black. There
was nothing else, except that the Gorgon's head in the wall
seemed to glow like a sun in hell.</p>

<p>I suppose I must have tried to enter. All I know is that I
found myself staggering back, rather badly burned. I covered my
eyes, and as I looked through my fingers I seemed to see the
flames flowing under the wall, where there may have been lockers,
or possibly another entrance. Then the great oak door suddenly
shrivelled like gauze, and with a roar the fiery river poured
into the house.</p>

<p>I ducked myself in the lake to ease the pain, and then ran
back as hard as I could by the way I had come. Dubellay, poor
devil, was beyond my aid. After that I am not very clear what
happened. I know that the house burned like a haystack. I found
one of the men-servants on the lawn, and I think I helped to get
the other down from his room by one of the rain-pipes. By the
time the neighbours arrived the house was ashes, and I was pretty
well mother-naked. They took me to the inn and put me to bed, and
I remained there till after the inquest. The coroner's jury were
puzzled, but they found it simply death by misadventure; a lot of
country houses were burned that summer. There was nothing found
of Dubellay; nothing remained of the house except a few blackened
pillars; the altar and the sculptures were so cracked and scarred
that no museum wanted them. The place has not been rebuilt, and
for all I know they are there to-day. I am not going back to look
for them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nightingale finished his story and looked round his
audience.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me for an explanation," he said, "for I haven't
any. You may believe if you like that the god Vaunus inhabited
the temple which Dubellay built for him, and, when his votary
grew scared and tried Sidonius's receipt for shifting the
dedication, became angry and slew him with his flaming wind. That
wind seems to have been a perquisite of Vaunus. We know more
about him now, for last year they dug up a temple of his in
Wales."</p>

<p>"Lightning," some one suggested.</p>

<p>"It was a quiet night, with no thunderstorm," said
Nightingale.</p>

<p>"Isn't the countryside volcanic?" Peckwether asked. "What
about pockets of natural gas or something of the kind?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. You may please yourself in your explanation. I'm
afraid I can't help you. All I know is that I don't propose to
visit that valley again!"</p>

<p>"What became of your Theocritus?"</p>

<p>"Burned, like everything else. However, that didn't worry me
much. Six weeks later came the War, and I had other things to
think about."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We were discussing the vagaries of ambition, and decided that
most of the old prizes that humanity contended for had had their
gilt rubbed off. Kingdoms, for example, which younger sons used
to set out to conquer. It was agreed that nowadays there was a
great deal of drudgery and very little fun in being a king.</p>

<p>"Besides, it can't be done," Leithen put in. "The Sarawak
case. Sovereignty over territory can only be acquired by a
British subject on behalf of His Majesty."</p>

<p>There was far more real power, someone argued, in the
profession of prophet. Mass-persuasion was never such a force as
to-day. Sandy Arbuthnot, who had known Gandhi and admired him,
gave us a picture of that strange popular leader--ascetic,
genius, dreamer, child. "For a little," he said, "Gandhi had more
absolute sway over a bigger lump of humanity than anybody except
Lenin."</p>

<p>"I once knew Lenin," said Fulleylove, the traveller, and we
all turned to him.</p>

<p>"It must have been more than twenty years ago," he explained.
"I was working at the British Museum and lived in lodgings in
Bloomsbury, and he had a room at the top of the house. Ilyitch
was the name we knew him by. He was a little, beetle-browed chap,
with a pale face and the most amazing sleepy black eyes, which
would suddenly twinkle and blaze as some thought passed through
his mind. He was very pleasant and good-humoured, and would spend
hours playing with the landlady's children. I remember I once
took him down with me for a day into the country, and he was the
merriest little grig. . . . Did I realise how big he was? No, I
cannot say I did. He was the ordinary Marxist, and he wanted to
resurrect Russia by hydraulics and electrification. He seemed to
be a funny compound of visionary and <i>terre-&agrave;-terre</i>
scientist. But I realised that he could lay a spell on his
countrymen. I have been to Russian meetings with him--I talk
Russian, you know--and it was astounding the way he could make
his audience look at him like hungry sheep. He gave me the
impression of utter courage and candour, and a kind of demoniac
simplicity. . . . No, I never met him again, but oddly enough I
was in Moscow during his funeral. Russian geographers were
interesting themselves in the line of the old silk-route to
Cathay, and I was there by request to advise them. I had not a
very comfortable time, but everybody was very civil to me. So I
saw Lenin's funeral, and unless you saw that you can have no
notion of his power. A great black bier like an altar, and
hundreds and thousands of people weeping and worshipping--yes,
worshipping."</p>

<p>"The successful prophet becomes a kind of god," said Lamancha.
"Have you ever known a god, Sandy? . . . No more have I. But
there is one living to-day somewhere in Scotland. Johnston is his
name. I once met a very particular friend of his. I will tell you
the story, and you can believe it or not as you like."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I had this narrative--he said--from my friend Mr. Peter
Thomson of "Jessieville," Maxwell Avenue, Strathbungo, whom I
believe to be a man incapable of mendacity, or, indeed, of
imagination. He is a prosperous and retired ship's captain,
dwelling in the suburbs of Glasgow, who plays two rounds of golf
every day of the week, and goes twice every Sunday to a pink, new
church. You may often see his ample figure, splendidly habited in
broadcloth and finished off with one of those square felt hats
which are the Scottish emblem of respectability, moving sedately
by Mrs. Thomson's side down the avenue of "Balmorals" and
"Bellevues" where dwell the aristocracy of Strathbungo. It was
not there that I met him, however, but in a Clyde steamboat going
round the Mull, where I spent a comfortless night on my way to a
Highland fishing. It was blowing what he called "a wee bit o'
wind," and I could not face the odorous bunks which opened on the
dining-room. Seated abaft the funnel, in an atmosphere of
ham-and-eggs, bilge and fresh western breezes, he revealed his
heart to me, and this I found in it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"About the age of forty"--said Mr. Thomson--"I was captain of
the steamer <i>Archibald McKelvie,</i> 1,700 tons burthen,
belonging to Brock, Rattray, and Linklater, of Greenock. We were
principally engaged in the China trade, but made odd trips into
the Malay Archipelago and once or twice to Australia. She was a
handy bit boat, and I'll not deny that I had many mercies
vouchsafed to me when I was her skipper. I raked in a bit of
salvage now and then, and my trading commission, paid regularly
into the British Linen Bank at Maryhill, was mounting up to a
fairish sum. I had no objection to Eastern parts, for I had a
good constitution and had outgrown the daftnesses of youth. The
berth suited me well, I had a decent lot for ship's company, and
I would gladly have looked forward to spending the rest of my
days by the <i>Archibald McKelvie.</i></p>

<p>"Providence, however, thought otherwise, for He was preparing
a judgment against that ship like the kind you read about in
books. We were five days out from Singapore, shaping our course
for the Philippines, where the Americans were then fighting, when
we ran into a queer lown sea. Not a breath of air came out of the
sky; if you kindled a match the flame wouldna leap, but
smouldered like touchwood; and every man's body ran with sweat
like a mill-lade. I kenned fine we were in for the terrors of
hell, but I hadna any kind of notion how terrible hell could be.
First came a wind that whipped away my funnel, like a
potato-peeling. We ran before it, and it was like the swee-gee we
used to play at when we were laddies. One moment the muckle sea
would get up on its hinder end and look at you, and the next you
were looking at it as if you were on the top of Ben Lomond
looking down on Luss. Presently I saw land in a gap of the
waters, a land with great blood-red mountains, and, thinks I to
myself, if we keep up the pace this boat of mine will not be
hindered from ending two or three miles inland in somebody's
kailyard. I was just wondering how we would get the <i>Archibald
McKelvie</i> back to her native element when she saved me the
trouble; for she ran dunt on some kind of a rock, and went
straight to the bottom.</p>

<p>"I was the only man saved alive, and if you ask me how it
happened I don't know. I felt myself choking in a whirlpool; then
I was flung through the air and brought down with a smack into
deep waters; then I was in the air again, and this time I landed
amongst sand and tree-trunks and got a bash on the head which
dozened my senses.</p>

<p>"When I came to it was morning, and the storm had abated. I
was lying about half-way up a beach of fine white sand, for the
wave that had carried me landwards in its flow had brought me
some of the road back in its ebb. All round me was a sort of
free-coup--trees knocked to matchwood, dead fish, and birds and
beasts, and some boards which I jaloused came from the
<i>Archibald McKelvie.</i> I had a big bump on my head, but
otherwise I was well and clear in my wits, though empty in the
stomach and very dowie in the heart. For I knew something about
the islands, of which I supposed this to be one. They were either
barren wastes, with neither food nor water, or else they were
inhabited by the bloodiest cannibals of the archipelago. It
looked as if my choice lay between having nothing to eat and
being eaten myself.</p>

<p>"I got up, and, after returning thanks to my Maker, went for a
walk in the woods. They were full of queer painted birds, and it
was an awful job climbing in and out of the fallen trees. By and
by I came into an open bit with a burn where I slockened my
thirst. It cheered me up, and I was just beginning to think that
this was not such a bad island, and looking to see if I could
find anything in the nature of cocoanuts, when I heard a whistle
like a steam-siren. It was some sort of signal, for the next I
knew I was in the grip of a dozen savages, my arms and feet were
lashed together, and I was being carried swiftly through the
forest.</p>

<p>"It was a rough journey, and the discomfort of that heathen
handling kept me from reflecting upon my desperate position.
After nearly three hours we stopped, and I saw that we had come
to a city. The streets were not much to look at, and the houses
were mud and thatch, but on a hillock in the middle stood a
muckle temple not unlike a Chinese pagoda. There was a man
blowing a horn, and a lot of folk shouting, but I paid no
attention, for I was sore troubled with the cramp in my left leg.
They took me into one of the huts and made signs that I was to
have it for my lodging. They brought me water to wash, and a very
respectable dinner, which included a hen and a vegetable not
unlike greens. Then they left me to myself, and I lay down and
slept for a round of the clock.</p>

<p>"I was three days in that hut. I had plenty to eat and the
folk were very civil, but they wouldna let me outbye and there
was no window to look out of. I couldna make up my mind what they
wanted with me. I was a prisoner, but they did not behave as if
they bore any malice, and I might have thought I was an honoured
guest, but for the guards at the door. Time hung heavy on my
hands, for I had nothing to read and no light to read by. I said
over all the chapters of the Bible and all the Scots songs I
could remember, and I tried to make a poem about my adventures,
but I stuck at the fifth line, for I couldna find a rhyme to
McKelvie.</p>

<p>"On the fourth morning I was awakened by the most deafening
din. I saw through the door that the streets were full of folk in
holiday clothes, most of them with flowers in their hair and
carrying palm branches in their hands. It was like something out
of a Bible picture book. After I had my breakfast four lads in
long white gowns arrived, and in spite of all my protests they
made a bonny spectacle of me. They took off my clothes, me
blushing with shame, and rubbed me with a kind of oil that smelt
of cinnamon. Then they shaved my chin, and painted on my forehead
a mark like a freemason's. Then they put on me a kind of white
nightgown with a red sash round the middle, and they wouldna be
hindered from clapping on my head a great wreath of hothouse
flowers, as if I was a funeral.</p>

<p>"And then like a thunder-clap I realised my horrible position.
<i>I</i> <i>was a funeral.</i> I was to be offered up as a
sacrifice to some heathen god--an awful fate for a Free-kirk
elder in the prime of life.</p>

<p>"I was so paralytic with terror that I never tried to resist.
Indeed, it would have done me little good, for outside there
were, maybe, two hundred savages, armed and drilled like
soldiers. I was put into a sort of palanquin, and my bearers
started at a trot with me up the hill to the temple, the whole
population of the city running alongside, and singing songs about
their god. I was sick with fear, and I durstna look up, for I did
not know what awesome sight awaited me.</p>

<p>"At last I got my courage back. 'Peter,' I says to myself, 'be
a man. Remember your sainted Covenanting forefathers. You have
been chosen to testify for your religion, though it's no likely
that yon savages will understand what you say.' So I shut my jaw
and resolved before I died to make a declaration of my religious
principles, and to loosen some of the heathens' teeth with my
fists.</p>

<p>"We stopped at the temple door and I was led through a court
and into a muckle great place like a barn, with bats flying about
the ceiling. Here there were nearly three thousand heathens
sitting on their hunkers. They sang a hymn when they saw me, and
I was just getting ready for action when my bearers carried me
into another place, which I took to be the Holy of Holies. It was
about half the size of the first, and at the end of it was a
great curtain of leopards' skins hanging from roof to floor. My
bearers set me in the middle of the room, and then rolled about
on their stomachs in adoration before the curtain. After a bit
they finished their prayers and crawled out backwards, and I was
left alone in that fearsome place.</p>

<p>"It was the worst experience of my life. I believed that
behind the skins there was a horrible idol, and that at any
moment a priest with a knife would slip in to cut my throat. You
may crack about courage, but I tell you that a man who can wait
without a quiver on his murderers in the middle of a gloomy kirk
is more than human. I am not ashamed to confess that the sweat
ran over my brow, and my teeth were knocking in my head.</p>

<p>"But nothing happened. Nothing, except that as I sat there I
began to notice a most remarkable smell. At first I thought the
place was on fire. Then I thought it was the kind of stink called
incense that they make in Popish kirks, for I once wandered into
a cathedral in Santiago. But neither guess was right, and then I
put my thumb on the proper description. It was nothing but the
smell of the third-class carriages on the Coatbridge train on a
Saturday night after a football match--the smell of plug tobacco
smoked in clay pipes that were no just very clean. My eyes were
getting accustomed to the light, and I found the place no that
dark; and as I looked round to see what caused the smell, I spied
something like smoke coming from beyond the top of the
curtain.</p>

<p>"I noticed another thing. There was a hole in the curtain,
about six feet from the floor, and at that hole as I watched I
saw an eye. My heart stood still, for, thinks I, that'll be the
priest of Baal who presently will stick a knife into me. It was
long ere I could screw up courage to look again, but I did it.
And then I saw that the eye was not that of a savage, which would
be black and blood-shot. It was a blue eye, and, as I looked, it
winked at me.</p>

<p>"And then a voice spoke out from behind the curtain, and this
was what it said. It said, 'God-sake, Peter, is that you? And how
did ye leave them a' at Maryhill?'</p>

<p>"And from behind the curtain walked a muckle man, dressed in a
pink blanket, a great red-headed man, with a clay pipe in his
mouth. It was the god of the savages, and who do ye think it was?
A man Johnston, who used to bide in the same close as me in
Glasgow. . . ."</p>

<p>Mr. Thomson's emotion overcame him, and he accepted a stiff
drink from my flask. Wiping away a tear, which may have been of
sentiment or of mirth, he continued:</p>

<p>"You may imagine that I was joyful and surprised to see him,
and he, so to speak, fell on my neck like the father of the
Prodigal Son. He hadna seen a Scotch face for four years. He
raked up one or two high priests and gave instructions, and soon
I was comfortably lodged in a part of the temple close to his own
rooms. Eh, man, it was a noble sight to see Johnston and the
priests. He was a big, red-haired fellow, six feet four, and as
strong as a stot, with a voice like a north-easter, and yon
natives fair crawled like caterpillars in his presence. I never
saw a man with such a natural talent for being a god. You would
have thought he had been bred to the job all his days, and yet I
minded him keeping a grocer's shop in the Dalmarnock Road.</p>

<p>"That night he told me his story. It seemed that he had got a
post at Shanghai in a trading house, and was coming out to it in
one of those God-forgotten German tramps that defile the China
seas. Like me, he fell in with a hurricane, and, like me, his
ship was doomed. He was a powerful swimmer, and managed to keep
afloat until he found some drifting wreckage, and after the wind
had gone down he paddled ashore. There he was captured by the
savages, and taken, like me, to their city. They were going to
sacrifice him, but one chief, wiser than the rest, called
attention to his size and strength, and pointed out that they
were at war with their neighbours, and that a big man would be of
more use in the fighting line than on an altar in the temple.</p>

<p>"So off went Johnston to the wars. He was a bonny fighter, and
very soon they made him captain of the royal bodyguard, and a
fortnight later the general commanding-in-chief over the whole
army. He said he had never enjoyed himself so much in his life,
and when he got back from his battles the whole population of the
city used to meet him with songs and flowers. Then an old priest
found an ancient prophecy about a Red God who would come out of
the sea and lead the people to victory. Very soon there was a
strong party for making Johnston a god, and when, with the help
of a few sticks of trade dynamite, he had blown up the capital of
the other side and brought back his army in triumph with a
prisoner apiece, popular feeling could not be restrained.
Johnston was hailed as divine. He hadna much grip of the
language, and couldna explain the situation, so he thought it
best to submit.</p>

<p>"'Mind you,' he said to me, 'I've been a good god to these
poor blind ignorant folk.' He had stopped the worst of their
habits and put down human sacrifices, and got a sort of town
council appointed to keep the city clean, and he had made the
army the most efficient thing ever heard of in the islands. And
now he was preparing to leave. This was what they expected, for
the prophecy had said that the Red God, after being the saviour
of his people, would depart as he had come across the sea. So,
under his directions, they had built him a kind of boat with
which he hoped to reach Singapore. He had got together a
considerable fortune, too, chiefly in rubies, for as a god he had
plenty of opportunities of acquiring wealth honestly. He said
there was a sort of greengrocer's and butcher's shop before his
altar every morning, and he got one of the priests, who had some
business notions, to sell off the goods for him.</p>

<p>"There was just one thing that bothered Mr. Johnston. He was a
good Christian man and had been an elder in a kirk in the
Cowcaddens, and he was much in doubt whether he had not committed
a mortal sin in accepting the worship of these heathen islanders.
Often I argued it out with him, but I did not seem able to
comfort him rightly. 'Ye see,' he used to say to me, 'if I have
broken anything, it's the spirit and no the letter of the
commandment. I havena set up a graven image, for ye canna call me
a graven image.'</p>

<p>"I mind that I quoted to him the conduct of Naaman, who was
allowed to bow in the house of Rimmon, but he would not have it.
'No, no,' he cried, 'that has nothing to do with the point. It's
no a question of my bowing in the house of Rimmon. I'm auld
Rimmon himself."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"That's a strange story, Mr. Thomson," I said. "Is it
true?"</p>

<p>"True as death. But you havena heard the end of it. We got
away, and by-and-by we reached Singapore, and in course of time
our native land. Johnston, he was a very rich man now, and I
didna go without my portion; so the loss of the <i>Archibald
McKelvie</i> turned out the best piece of luck in my life. I
bought a share in Brock's Line, but nothing would content
Johnston but that he must be a gentleman. He got a big estate in
Annandale, where all the Johnstons came from long ago, and one
way and another he has spent an awful siller on it. Land will
swallow up money quicker than the sea."</p>

<p>"And what about his conscience?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It's keeping quieter," said Mr. Thomson. "He takes a great
interest in Foreign Missions, to which he subscribes largely, and
they tell me that he has given the funds to build several new
kirks. Oh yes, and he's just been adopted as a prospective
Liberal candidate. I had a letter from him no further back than
yesterday. It's about his political career, as he calls it. He
told me, what didna need telling, that I must never mention a
word about his past. 'If discretion was necessary before,' he
says, 'it's far more necessary now, for how could the Party of
Progress have any confidence in a man if they heard he had once
been a god?'"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Burminster had been to a Guildhall dinner the night before,
which had been attended by many--to him--unfamiliar celebrities.
He had seen for the first time in the flesh people whom he had
long known by reputation, and he declared that in every case the
picture he had formed of them had been cruelly shattered. An
eminent poet, he said, had looked like a starting-price
bookmaker, and a financier of world-wide fame had been exactly
like the music-master at his preparatory school. Wherefore
Burminster made the profound deduction that things were never
what they seemed.</p>

<p>"That's only because you have a feeble imagination," said
Sandy Arbuthnot. "If you had really understood Timson's poetry
you would have realised that it went with close-cropped red hair
and a fat body, and you should have known that Macintyre (this
was the financier) had the music-and-metaphysics type of mind.
That's why he puzzles the City so. If you understand a man's work
well enough you can guess pretty accurately what he'll look like.
I don't mean the colour of his eyes and his hair, but the general
atmosphere of him."</p>

<p>It was Sandy's agreeable habit to fling an occasional paradox
at the table with the view of starting an argument. This time he
stirred up Pugh, who had come to the War Office from the Indian
Staff Corps. Pugh had been a great figure in Secret Service work
in the East, but he did not look the part, for he had the air of
a polo-playing cavalry subaltern. The skin was stretched as tight
over his cheek-bones as over the knuckles of a clenched fist, and
was so dark that it had the appearance of beaten bronze. He had
black hair, rather beady black eyes, and the hooky nose which in
the Celt often goes with that colouring. He was himself a very
good refutation of Sandy's theory.</p>

<p>"I don't agree," Pugh said. "At least not as a general
principle. One piece of humanity whose work I studied with the
microscope for two aching years upset all my notions when I came
to meet it."</p>

<p>Then he told us this story.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"When I was brought to England in November '17 and given a
'hush' department on three floors of an eighteenth-century house
in a back street, I had a good deal to learn about my business.
That I learned it in reasonable time was due to the
extraordinarily fine staff that I found provided for me. Not one
of them was a regular soldier. They were all educated men--they
had to be in that job--but they came out of every sort of
environment. One of the best was a Shetland laird, another was an
Admiralty Court K.C., and I had besides a metallurgical chemist,
a golf champion, a leader-writer, a popular dramatist, several
actuaries, and an East-end curate. None of them thought of
anything but his job, and at the end of the War, when some ass
proposed to make them O.B.E.'s, there was a very fair imitation
of a riot. A more loyal crowd never existed, and they accepted me
as their chief as unquestioningly as if I had been with them
since 1914.</p>

<p>"To the War in the ordinary sense they scarcely gave a
thought. You found the same thing in a lot of other
behind-the-lines departments, and I daresay it was a good
thing--it kept their nerves quiet and their minds concentrated.
After all our business was only to decode and decypher German
messages; we had nothing to do with the use which was made of
them. It was a curious little nest, and when the Armistice came
my people were flabbergasted--they hadn't realised that their job
was bound up with the War.</p>

<p>"The one who most interested me was my second-in-command,
Philip Channell. He was a man of forty-three, about
five-foot-four in height, weighing, I fancy, under nine stone,
and almost as blind as an owl. He was good enough at papers with
his double glasses, but he could hardly recognise you three yards
off. He had been a professor at some Midland college--mathematics
or physics, I think--and as soon as the War began he had tried to
enlist. Of course they wouldn't have him--he was about E5 in any
physical classification, besides being well over age--but he
would take no refusal, and presently he worried his way into the
Government service. Fortunately he found a job which he could do
superlatively well, for I do not believe there was a man alive
with more natural genius for cryptography.</p>

<p>"I don't know if any of you have ever given your mind to that
heart-breaking subject. Anyhow you know that secret writing falls
under two heads--codes and cyphers, and that codes are
combinations of words and cyphers of numerals. I remember how one
used to be told that no code or cypher which was practically
useful was really undiscoverable, and in a sense that is true,
especially of codes. A system of communication which is in
constant use must obviously not be too intricate, and a working
code, if you get long enough for the job, can generally be read.
That is why a code is periodically changed by the users. There
are rules in worrying out the permutations and combinations of
letters in most codes, for human ingenuity seems to run in
certain channels, and a man who has been a long time at the
business gets surprisingly clever at it. You begin by finding out
a little bit, and then empirically building up the rules of
decoding, till in a week or two you get the whole thing. Then,
when you are happily engaged in reading enemy messages, the code
is changed suddenly, and you have to start again from the
beginning. . . . You can make a code, of course, that it is
simply impossible to read except by accident--the key to which is
a page of some book, for example--but fortunately that kind is
not of much general use.</p>

<p>"Well, we got on pretty well with the codes, and read the
intercepted enemy messages, cables and wireless, with
considerable ease and precision. It was mostly diplomatic stuff,
and not very important. The more valuable stuff was in cypher,
and that was another pair of shoes. With a code you can build up
the interpretation by degrees, but with a cypher you either know
it or you don't--there are no half-way houses. A cypher, since it
deals with numbers, is a horrible field for mathematical
ingenuity. Once you have written out the letters of a message in
numerals there are many means by which you can lock it and
double-lock it. The two main devices, as you know, are
transposition and substitution, and there is no limit to the ways
one or other or both can be used. There is nothing to prevent a
cypher having a double meaning, produced by two different
methods, and, as a practical question, you have to decide which
meaning is intended. By way of an extra complication, too, the
message, when decyphered, may turn out to be itself in a
difficult code. I can tell you our job wasn't exactly a rest
cure."</p>

<p>Burminster, looking puzzled, inquired as to the locking of
cyphers.</p>

<p>"It would take too long to explain. Roughly, you write out a
message horizontally in numerals; then you pour it into vertical
columns, the number and order of which are determined by a
keyword; then you write out the contents of the columns
horizontally, following the lines across. To unlock it you have
to have the key word, so as to put it back into the vertical
columns, and then into the original horizontal form."</p>

<p>Burminster cried out like one in pain. "It can't be done.
Don't tell me that any human brain could solve such an
acrostic."</p>

<p>"It was frequently done," said Pugh.</p>

<p>"By you?"</p>

<p>"Lord bless you, not by me. I can't do a simple cross-word
puzzle. By my people."</p>

<p>"Give me the trenches," said Burminster in a hollow voice.
"Give me the trenches any day. Do you seriously mean to tell me
that you could sit down before a muddle of numbers and travel
back the way they had been muddled to an original that made
sense?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't, but Channell could--in most cases. You see, we
didn't begin entirely in the dark. We already knew the kind of
intricacies that the enemy favoured, and the way we worked was by
trying a variety of clues till we lit on the right one."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed! Go on about your man Channell."</p>

<p>"This isn't Channell's story," said Pugh. "He only comes into
it accidentally. . . . There was one cypher which always defeated
us, a cypher used between the German General Staff and their
forces in the East. It was a locked cypher, and Channell had
given more time to it than to any dozen of the others, for it put
him on his mettle. But he confessed himself absolutely beaten. He
wouldn't admit that it was insoluble, but he declared that he
would need a bit of real luck to solve it. I asked him what kind
of luck, and he said a mistake and a repetition. That, he said,
might give him a chance of establishing equations.</p>

<p>"We called this particular cypher 'P.Y.,' and we hated it
poisonously. We felt like pygmies battering at the base of a high
stone tower. Dislike of the thing soon became dislike of the man
who had conceived it. Channell and I used to--I won't say amuse,
for it was too dashed serious--but torment ourselves by trying to
picture the fellow who owned the brain that was responsible for
P.Y. We had a pretty complete <i>dossier</i> of the German
Intelligence Staff, but of course we couldn't know who was
responsible for this particular cypher. We knew no more than his
code name, Reinmar, with which he signed the simpler messages to
the East, and Channell, who was a romantic little chap for all
his science, had got it into his head that it was a woman. He
used to describe her to me as if he had seen her--a she-devil,
young, beautiful, with a much-painted white face, and eyes like a
cobra's. I fancy he read a rather low class of novel in his
off-time.</p>

<p>"My picture was different. At first I thought of the
histrionic type of scientist, the 'ruthless brain' type, with a
high forehead and a jaw puckered like a chimpanzee. But that
didn't seem to work, and I settled on a picture of a first-class
<i>Generalstaboffizier,</i> as handsome as Falkenhayn, trained to
the last decimal, absolutely passionless, with a mind that worked
with the relentless precision of a fine machine. We all of us at
the time suffered from the bogy of this kind of German, and, when
things were going badly, as in March '18, I couldn't sleep for
hating him. The infernal fellow was so water-tight and
armour-plated, a Goliath who scorned the pebbles from our feeble
slings.</p>

<p>"Well, to make a long story short, there came a moment in
September '18 when P.Y. was about the most important thing in the
world. It mattered enormously what Germany was doing in Syria,
and we knew that it was all in P.Y. Every morning a pile of the
intercepted German wireless messages lay on Channell's table,
which were as meaningless to him as a child's scrawl. I was
prodded by my chiefs and in turn I prodded Channell. We had a
week to find the key to the cypher, after which things must go on
without us, and if we had failed to make anything of it in
eighteen months of quiet work, it didn't seem likely that we
would succeed in seven feverish days. Channell nearly went off
his head with overwork and anxiety. I used to visit his dingy
little room and find him fairly grizzled and shrunken with
fatigue.</p>

<p>"This isn't a story about him, though there is a good story
which I may tell you another time. As a matter of fact we won on
the post. P.Y. made a mistake. One morning we got a long message
dated <i>en clair,</i> then a very short message, and then a
third message almost the same as the first. The second must mean
'Your message of to-day's date unintelligible, please repeat,'
the regular formula. This gave us a translation of a bit of the
cypher. Even that would not have brought it out, and for twelve
hours Channell was on the verge of lunacy, till it occurred to
him that Reinmar might have signed the long message with his
name, as we used to do sometimes in cases of extreme urgency. He
was right, and, within three hours of the last moment Operations
could give us, we had the whole thing pat. As I have said, that
is a story worth telling, but it is not this one.</p>

<p>"We both finished the War too tired to think of much except
that the darned thing was over. But Reinmar had been so long our
unseen but constantly pictured opponent that we kept up a certain
interest in him. We would like to have seen how he took the
licking, for he must have known that we had licked him. Mostly
when you lick a man at a game you rather like him, but I didn't
like Reinmar. In fact I made him a sort of compost of everything
I had ever disliked in a German. Channell stuck to his she-devil
theory, but I was pretty certain that he was a youngish man with
an intellectual arrogance which his country's
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> would in no way lessen. He would
never acknowledge defeat. It was highly improbable that I should
ever find out who he was, but I felt that if I did, and met him
face to face, my dislike would be abundantly justified.</p>

<p>"As you know, for a year or two after the Armistice I was a
pretty sick man. Most of us were. We hadn't the fillip of getting
back to civilised comforts, like the men in the trenches. We had
always been comfortable enough in body, but our minds were fagged
out, and there is no easy cure for that. My digestion went nobly
to pieces, and I endured a miserable space of lying in bed and
living on milk and olive-oil. After that I went back to work, but
the darned thing always returned, and every leech had a different
regime to advise. I tried them all--dry meals, a snack every two
hours, lemon juice, sour milk, starvation, knocking off
tobacco--but nothing got me more than half-way out of the trough.
I was a burden to myself and a nuisance to others, dragging my
wing through life, with a constant pain in my tummy.</p>

<p>"More than one doctor advised an operation, but I was chary
about that, for I had seen several of my friends operated on for
the same mischief and left as sick as before. Then a man told me
about a German fellow called Christoph, who was said to be very
good at handling my trouble. The best hand at diagnosis in the
world, my informant said--no fads--treated every case on its
merits--a really original mind. Dr. Christoph had a modest
kurhaus at a place called Rosensee in the S&auml;chischen Sweitz.
By this time I was getting pretty desperate, so I packed a bag
and set off for Rosensee.</p>

<p>"It was a quiet little town at the mouth of a narrow valley,
tucked in under wooded hills, a clean fresh place with open
channels of running water in the streets. There was a big church
with an onion spire, a Catholic seminary, and a small tanning
industry. The kurhaus was halfway up a hill, and I felt better as
soon as I saw my bedroom, with its bare scrubbed floors and its
wide verandah looking up into a forest glade. I felt still better
when I saw Dr. Christoph. He was a small man with a grizzled
beard, a high forehead, and a limp, rather like what I imagine
the Apostle Paul must have been. He looked wise, as wise as an
old owl. His English was atrocious, but even when he found that I
talked German fairly well he didn't expand in speech. He would
deliver no opinion of any kind until he had had me at least a
week under observation; but somehow I felt comforted, for I
concluded that a first-class brain had got to work on me.</p>

<p>"The other patients were mostly Germans with a sprinkling of
Spaniards, but to my delight I found Channell. He also had been
having a thin time since we parted. Nerves were his
trouble--general nervous debility and perpetual insomnia, and his
college had given him six months' leave of absence to try to get
well. The poor chap was as lean as a sparrow, and he had the
large dull eyes and the dry lips of the sleepless. He had arrived
a week before me, and like me was under observation. But his
vetting was different from mine, for he was a mental case, and
Dr. Christoph used to devote hours to trying to unriddle his
nervous tangles. 'He is a good man for a German,' said Channell,
'but he is on the wrong tack. There's nothing wrong with my mind.
I wish he'd stick to violet rays and massage, instead of asking
me silly questions about my great-grandmother.'</p>

<p>"Channell and I used to go for invalidish walks in the woods,
and we naturally talked about the years we had worked together.
He was living mainly in the past, for the War had been the great
thing in his life, and his professorial duties seemed trivial by
comparison. As we tramped among the withered bracken and heather
his mind was always harking back to the dingy little room where
he had smoked cheap cigarettes and worked fourteen hours out of
the twenty-four. In particular he was as eagerly curious about
our old antagonist, Reinmar, as he had been in 1918. He was more
positive than ever that she was a woman, and I believe that one
of the reasons that had induced him to try a cure in Germany was
a vague hope that he might get on her track. I had almost
forgotten about the thing, and I was amused by Channell in the
part of the untiring sleuth-hound.</p>

<p>"'You won't find her in the Kurhaus,' I said. 'Perhaps she is
in some old schloss in the neighbourhood, waiting for you like
the Sleeping Beauty.'</p>

<p>"'I'm serious,' he said plaintively. 'It is purely a matter of
intellectual curiosity, but I confess I would give a great deal
to see her face to face. After I leave here, I thought of going
to Berlin to make some inquiries. But I'm handicapped, for I know
nobody and I have no credentials. Why don't you, who have a large
acquaintance and far more authority, take the thing up?'</p>

<p>"I told him that my interest in the matter had flagged and
that I wasn't keen on digging into the past, but I promised to
give him a line to our Military Attach&eacute; if he thought of
going to Berlin. I rather discouraged him from letting his mind
dwell too much on events in the War. I said that he ought to try
to bolt the door on all that had contributed to his present
breakdown.</p>

<p>"'That is not Dr. Christoph's opinion,' he said emphatically.
'He encourages me to talk about it. You see, with me it is a
purely intellectual interest. I have no emotion in the matter. I
feel quite friendly towards Reinmar, whoever she may be. It is,
if you like, a piece of romance. I haven't had so many romantic
events in my life that I want to forget this.'</p>

<p>"'Have you told Dr. Christoph about Reinmar?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he said, 'and he was mildly interested. You know the
way he looks at you with his solemn grey eyes. I doubt if he
quite understood what I meant, for a little provincial doctor,
even though he is a genius in his own line, is not likely to know
much about the ways of the Great General Staff. . . . I had to
tell him, for I have to tell him all my dreams, and lately I have
taken to dreaming about Reinmar.'</p>

<p>"'What's she like?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Oh, a most remarkable figure. Very beautiful, but uncanny.
She has long fair hair down to her knees.'</p>

<p>"Of course I laughed. 'You're mixing her up with the
Valkyries,' I said. 'Lord, it would be an awkward business if you
met that she-dragon in the flesh.'</p>

<p>"But he was quite solemn about it, and declared that his
waking picture of her was not in the least like his dreams. He
rather agreed with my nonsense about the old schloss. He thought
that she was probably some penniless grandee, living solitary in
a moated grange, with nothing now to exercise her marvellous
brain on, and eating her heart out with regret and shame. He drew
so attractive a character of her that I began to think that
Channell was in love with a being of his own creation, till he
ended with, 'But all the same she's utterly damnable. She must
be, you know.'</p>

<p>"After a fortnight I began to feel a different man. Dr.
Christoph thought that he had got on the track of the mischief,
and certainly, with his deep massage and a few simple drugs, I
had more internal comfort than I had known for three years. He
was so pleased with my progress that he refused to treat me as an
invalid. He encouraged me to take long walks into the hills, and
presently he arranged for me to go out roebuck-shooting with some
of the local junkers.</p>

<p>"I used to start before daybreak on the chilly November
mornings and drive to the top of one of the ridges, where I would
meet a collection of sportsmen and beaters, shepherded by a
fellow in a green uniform. We lined out along the ridge, and the
beaters, assisted by a marvellous collection of dogs, including
the sporting dachshund, drove the roe towards us. It wasn't very
cleverly managed, for the deer generally broke back, and it was
chilly waiting in the first hours with a powdering of snow on the
ground and the fir boughs heavy with frost crystals. But later,
when the sun grew stronger, it was a very pleasant mode of
spending a day. There was not much of a bag, but whenever a roe
or a capercailzie fell all the guns would assemble and drink
little glasses of <i>kirschwasser.</i> I had been lent a rifle,
one of those appalling contraptions which are double-barrelled
shot-guns and rifles in one, and to transpose from one form to
the other requires a mathematical calculation. The rifle had a
hair trigger too, and when I first used it I was nearly the death
of a respectable Saxon peasant.</p>

<p>"We all ate our midday meal together and in the evening,
before going home, we had coffee and cakes in one or other of the
farms. The party was an odd mixture, big farmers and small
squires, an hotel-keeper or two, a local doctor, and a couple of
lawyers from the town. At first they were a little shy of me, but
presently they thawed, and after the first day we were good
friends. They spoke quite frankly about the War, in which every
one of them had had a share, and with a great deal of dignity and
good sense.</p>

<p>"I learned to walk in Sikkim, and the little Saxon hills
seemed to me inconsiderable. But they were too much for most of
the guns, and instead of going straight up or down a slope they
always chose a circuit, which gave them an easy gradient. One
evening, when we were separating as usual, the beaters taking a
short cut and the guns a circuit, I felt that I wanted exercise,
so I raced the beaters downhill, beat them soundly, and had the
better part of an hour to wait for my companions, before we
adjourned to the farm for refreshment. The beaters must have
talked about my pace, for as we walked away one of the guns, a
lawyer called Meissen, asked me why I was visiting Rosensee at a
time of year when few foreigners came. I said I was staying with
Dr. Christoph.</p>

<p>"'Is he then a private friend of yours?' he asked.</p>

<p>"I told him No, that I had come to his kurhaus for treatment,
being sick. His eyes expressed polite scepticism. He was not
prepared to regard as an invalid a man who went down a hill like
an avalanche.</p>

<p>"But, as we walked in the frosty dusk, he was led to speak of
Dr. Christoph, of whom he had no personal knowledge, and I
learned how little honour a prophet may have in his own country.
Rosensee scarcely knew him, except as a doctor who had an
inexplicable attraction for foreign patients. Meissen was curious
about his methods and the exact diseases in which he specialised.
'Perhaps he may yet save me a journey to Homburg?' he laughed.
'It is well to have a skilled physician at one's doorstep. The
doctor is something of a hermit, and except for his patients does
not appear to welcome his kind. Yet he is a good man, beyond
doubt, and there are those who say that in the War he was a
hero.'</p>

<p>"This surprised me, for I could not imagine Dr. Christoph in
any fighting capacity, apart from the fact that he must have been
too old. I thought that Meissen might refer to work in the base
hospitals. But he was positive; Dr. Christoph had been in the
trenches; the limping leg was a war wound.</p>

<p>"I had had very little talk with the doctor, owing to my case
being free from nervous complications. He would say a word to me
morning and evening about my diet, and pass the time of day when
we met, but it was not till the very eve of my departure that we
had anything like a real conversation. He sent a message that he
wanted to see me for not less than one hour, and he arrived with
a batch of notes from which he delivered a kind of lecture on my
case. Then I realised what an immense amount of care and solid
thought he had expended on me. He had decided that his diagnosis
was right--my rapid improvement suggested that--but it was
necessary for some time to observe a simple regime, and to keep
an eye on certain symptoms. So he took a sheet of note-paper from
the table and in his small precise hand wrote down for me a few
plain commandments.</p>

<p>"There was something about him, the honest eyes, the mouth
which looked as if it had been often compressed in suffering, the
air of grave good-will, which I found curiously attractive. I
wished that I had been a mental case like Channell, and had had
more of his society. I detained him in talk, and he seemed not
unwilling. By and by we drifted to the War and it turned out that
Meissen was right.</p>

<p>"Dr. Christoph had gone as medical officer in November '14 to
the Ypres Salient with a Saxon regiment, and had spent the winter
there. In '15 he had been in Champagne, and in the early months
of '16 at Verdun, till he was invalided with rheumatic fever.
That is to say, he had had about seventeen months of consecutive
fighting in the worst areas with scarcely a holiday. A pretty
good record for a frail little middle-aged man!</p>

<p>"His family was then at Stuttgart, his wife and one little
boy. He took a long time to recover from the fever, and after
that was put on home duty. 'Till the War was almost over,' he
said, 'almost over, but not quite. There was just time for me to
go back to the front and get my foolish leg hurt.' I must tell
you that whenever he mentioned his war experience it was with a
comical deprecating smile, as if he agreed with anyone who might
think that gravity like his should have remained in bed.</p>

<p>"I assumed that this home duty was medical, until he said
something about getting rusty in his professional work. Then it
appeared that it had been some job connected with Intelligence.
'I am reputed to have a little talent for mathematics,' he said.
'No. I am no mathematical scholar, but, if you understand me, I
have a certain mathematical aptitude. My mind has always moved
happily among numbers. Therefore I was set to construct and to
interpret cyphers, a strange interlude in the noise of war. I sat
in a little room and excluded the world, and for a little I was
happy.'</p>

<p>"He went on to speak of the <i>enclave</i> of peace in which
he had found himself, and as I listened to his gentle monotonous
voice, I had a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"I took a sheet of note-paper from the stand, scribbled the
word <i>Reinmar</i> on it, and shoved it towards him. I had a
notion, you see, that I might surprise him into helping
Channell's researches.</p>

<p>"But it was I who got the big surprise. He stopped
thunderstruck, as soon as his eye caught the word, blushed
scarlet over every inch of face and bald forehead, seemed to have
difficulty in swallowing, and then gasped. 'How did you
know?'</p>

<p>"I hadn't known, and now that I did, the knowledge left me
speechless. This was the loathly opposite for which Channell and
I had nursed our hatred. When I came out of my stupefaction I
found that he had recovered his balance and was speaking slowly
and distinctly, as if he were making a formal confession.</p>

<p>"'You were among my opponents . . . that interests me deeply.
. . . I often wondered. . . . You beat me in the end. You are
aware of that?'</p>

<p>"I nodded. 'Only because you made a slip,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I made a slip. I was to blame--very gravely to blame,
for I let my private grief cloud my mind.'</p>

<p>"He seemed to hesitate, as if he were loath to stir something
very tragic in his memory.</p>

<p>"'I think I will tell you,' he said at last. 'I have often
wished--it is a childish wish--to justify my failure to those who
profited by it. My chiefs understood, of course, but my opponents
could not. In that month when I failed I was in deep sorrow. I
had a little son--his name was Reinmar--you remember that I took
that name for my code signature?'</p>

<p>"His eyes were looking beyond me into some vision of the
past.</p>

<p>"'He was, as you say, my mascot. He was all my family, and I
adored him. But in those days food was not plentiful. We were no
worse off than many million Germans, but the child was frail. In
the last summer of the War he developed phthisis due to
malnutrition, and in September he died. Then I failed my country,
for with him some virtue seemed to depart from my mind. You see,
my work was, so to speak, his also, as my name was his, and when
he left me he took my power with him. . . . So I stumbled. The
rest is known to you.'</p>

<p>"He sat staring beyond me, so small and lonely, that I could
have howled. I remember putting my hand on his shoulder, and
stammering some platitude about being sorry. We sat quite still
for a minute or two, and then I remembered Channell. Channell
must have poured his views of Reinmar into Dr. Christoph's ear. I
asked him if Channell knew.</p>

<p>"A flicker of a smile crossed his face.</p>

<p>"'Indeed no. And I will exact from you a promise never to
breathe to him what I have told you. He is my patient, and I must
first consider his case. At present he thinks that Reinmar is a
wicked and beautiful lady whom he may some day meet. That is
romance, and it is good for him to think so. . . . If he were
told the truth, he would be pitiful, and in Herr Channell's
condition it is important that he should not be vexed with such
emotions as pity.'"</p>

<h1><i>SIR EDWARD LEITHEN'S STORY</i></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The effect of night, of any flowing water, of lighted cities,
of the peep of day, of ships, of the open ocean, calls up in the
mind an army of anonymous desires and pleasures. Something, we
feel, should happen; we know not what, yet we proceed in quest of
it.--R. L. Stevenson.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Leithen's face had that sharp chiselling of the jaw and that
compression of the lips which seem to follow upon high legal
success. Also an overdose of German gas in 1918 had given his
skin a habitual pallor, so that he looked not unhealthy, but
notably urban. As a matter of fact he was one of the hardest men
I have ever known, but a chance observer might have guessed from
his complexion that he rarely left the pavements.</p>

<p>Burminster, who had come back from a month in the grass
countries with a face like a deep-sea mariner's, commented on
this one evening.</p>

<p>"How do you manage always to look the complete Cit, Ned?" he
asked. "You're as much a Londoner as a Parisian is a Parisian, if
you know what I mean."</p>

<p>Leithen said that he was not ashamed of it, and he embarked on
a eulogy of the metropolis. In London you met sooner or later
everybody you had ever known; you could lay your hand on any
knowledge you wanted; you could pull strings that controlled the
innermost Sahara and the topmost Pamirs. Romance lay in wait for
you at every street corner. It was the true City of the
Caliphs.</p>

<p>"That is what they say," said Sandy Arbuthnot sadly, "but I
never found it so. I yawn my head off in London. Nothing amusing
ever finds me out--I have to go and search for it, and it usually
costs the deuce of a lot."</p>

<p>"I once stumbled upon a pretty generous allowance of romance,"
said Leithen, "and it cost me precisely sixpence."</p>

<p>Then he told us this story.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It happened a good many years ago, just when I was beginning
to get on at the Bar. I spent busy days in court and chambers,
but I was young and had a young man's appetite for society, so I
used to dine out most nights and go to more balls than were good
for me. It was pleasant after a heavy day to dive into a
different kind of life. My rooms at the time were in Down Street,
the same house as my present one, only two floors higher up.</p>

<p>On a certain night in February I was dining in Bryanston
Square with the Nantleys. Mollie Nantley was an old friend, and
used to fit me as an unattached bachelor into her big dinners.
She was a young hostess and full of ambition, and one met an odd
assortment of people at her house. Mostly political, of course,
but a sprinkling of art and letters, and any visiting lion that
happened to be passing through. Mollie was a very innocent
lion-hunter, but she had a partiality for the breed.</p>

<p>I don't remember much about the dinner, except that the
principal guest had failed her. Mollie was loud in her
lamentations. He was a South American President who had
engineered a very pretty <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> the year
before, and was now in England on some business concerning the
finances of his state. You may remember his name--Ramon Pelem--he
made rather a stir in the world for a year or two. I had read
about him in the papers, and had looked forward to meeting him,
for he had won his way to power by extraordinary boldness and
courage, and he was quite young. There was a story that he was
partly English and that his grandfather's name had been Pelham. I
don't know what truth there was in that, but he knew England well
and Englishmen liked him.</p>

<p>Well, he had cried off on the telephone an hour before, and
Mollie was grievously disappointed. Her other guests bore the
loss with more fortitude, for I expect they thought he was a
brand of cigar.</p>

<p>In those days dinners began earlier and dances later than they
do to-day. I meant to leave soon, go back to my rooms and read
briefs, and then look in at Lady Samplar's dance between eleven
and twelve. So at nine-thirty I took my leave.</p>

<p>Jervis, the old butler, who had been my ally from boyhood, was
standing on the threshold, and in the square there was a
considerable crowd now thinning away. I asked what the trouble
was.</p>

<p>"There's been an arrest, Mr. Edward," he said in an awestruck
voice. "It 'appened when I was serving coffee in the dining-room,
but our Albert saw it all. Two foreigners, he said--proper
rascals by their look--were took away by the police just outside
this very door. The constables was very nippy and collared them
before they could use their pistols--but they 'ad pistols on them
and no mistake. Albert says he saw the weapons."</p>

<p>"Did they propose to burgle you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot say, Mr. Edward. But I shall give instructions for a
very careful lock-up to-night."</p>

<p>There were no cabs about, so I decided to walk on and pick one
up. When I got into Great Cumberland Place it began to rain
sharply, and I was just about to call a prowling hansom, when I
put my hand into my pocket. I found that I had no more than one
solitary sixpence.</p>

<p>I could of course have paid when I got to my flat. But as the
rain seemed to be slacking off, I preferred to walk. Mollie's
dining-room had been stuffy, I had been in court all day, and I
wanted some fresh air.</p>

<p>You know how in little things, when you have decided on a
course, you are curiously reluctant to change it. Before I got to
the Marble Arch it had begun to pour in downright earnest. But I
still stumped on. Only I entered the Park, for even in February
there is a certain amount of cover from the trees.</p>

<p>I passed one or two hurried pedestrians, but the place was
almost empty. The occasional lamps made only spots of light in a
dripping darkness, and it struck me that this was a curious patch
of gloom and loneliness to be so near to crowded streets, for
with the rain had come a fine mist. I pitied the poor devils to
whom it was the only home. There was one of them on a seat which
I passed. The collar of his thin shabby overcoat was turned up,
and his shameful old felt hat was turned down, so that only a few
square inches of pale face were visible. His toes stuck out of
his boots, and he seemed sunk in a sodden misery.</p>

<p>I passed him and then turned back. Casual charity is an easy
dope for the conscience, and I indulge in it too often. When I
approached him he seemed to stiffen, and his hands moved in his
pockets.</p>

<p>"A rotten night," I said. "Is sixpence any good to you?" And I
held out my solitary coin. He lifted his face, and I started. For
the eyes that looked at me were not those of a waster. They were
bright, penetrating, authoritative--and they were young. I was
conscious that they took in more of me than mine did of him.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," he said, as he took the coin, and the
voice was that of a cultivated man. "But I'm afraid I need rather
more than sixpence."</p>

<p>"How much?" I asked. This was clearly an original.</p>

<p>"To be accurate, five million pounds."</p>

<p>He was certainly mad, but I was fascinated by this wisp of
humanity. I wished that he would show more of his face.</p>

<p>"Till your ship comes home," I said, "you want a bed, and
you'd be the better of a change. Sixpence is all I have on me.
But if you come to my rooms I'll give you the price of a night's
lodging, and I think I might find you some old clothes."</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Close by--in Down Street." I gave the number.</p>

<p>He seemed to reflect, and then he shot a glance on either side
into the gloom behind the road. It may have been fancy, but I
thought that I saw something stir in the darkness.</p>

<p>"What are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>I was getting abominably wet, and yet I submitted to be
cross-examined by this waif.</p>

<p>"I am a lawyer," I said.</p>

<p>He looked at me again, very intently.</p>

<p>"Have you a telephone?" he asked.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Right," he said. "You seem a good fellow and I'll take you at
your word. I'll follow you. . . . Don't look back, please. It's
important. . . . I'll be in Down Street as soon as you. . . .
<i>Marchons."</i></p>

<p>It sounds preposterous, but I did exactly as I was bid. I
never looked back, but I kept my ears open for the sound of
following footsteps. I thought I heard them, and then they seemed
to die away. I turned out of the Park at Grosvenor Gate and went
down Park Lane. When I reached the house which contained my flat,
I looked up and down the street, but it was empty except for a
waiting four-wheeler. But just as I turned in I caught a glimpse
of someone running at the Hertford Street end. The runner came to
a sudden halt, and I saw that it was not the man I had left.</p>

<p>To my surprise I found the waif on the landing outside my
flat. I was about to tell him to stop outside, but as soon as I
unlocked the door he brushed past me and entered. My man, who did
not sleep on the premises, had left the light burning in the
little hall.</p>

<p>"Lock the door," he said in a tone of authority. "Forgive me
taking charge, but I assure you it is important."</p>

<p>Then to my amazement he peeled off the sopping overcoat, and
kicked off his disreputable shoes. They were odd shoes, for what
looked like his toes sticking out was really part of the make-up.
He stood up before me in underclothes and socks, and I noticed
that his underclothing seemed to be of the finest material.</p>

<p>"Now for your telephone," he said.</p>

<p>I was getting angry at these liberties.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I am President Pelem," he said, with all the dignity in the
world. "And you?"</p>

<p>"I?--oh, I am the German Emperor."</p>

<p>He laughed. "You know you invited me here," he said. "You've
brought this on yourself." Then he stared at me. "Hullo, I've
seen you before. You're Leithen. I saw you play at Lord's. I was
twelfth man for Harrow that year. . . . Now for the
telephone."</p>

<p>There was something about the fellow, something defiant and
debonair and young, that stopped all further protest on my part.
He might or might not be President Pelem, but he was certainly
not a wastrel. Besides he seemed curiously keyed up, as if the
occasion were desperately important, and he infected me with the
same feeling. I said no more, but led the way into my
sitting-room. He flung himself on the telephone, gave a number,
was instantly connected, and began a conversation in
monosyllables.</p>

<p>It was a queer jumble that I overheard. Bryanston Square was
mentioned, and the Park, and the number of my house was given--to
somebody. There was a string of foreign names--Pedro and
Alejandro and Manuel and Alcaza--and short breathless inquiries.
Then I heard--"a good fellow--looks as if he might be useful in a
row," and I wondered if he was referring to me. Some rapid
Spanish followed, and then, "Come round at once--they will be
here before you. Have policemen below, but don't let them come
up. We should be able to manage alone. Oh, and tell Burton to
ring up here as soon as he has news." And he gave my telephone
number.</p>

<p>I put some coals on the fire, changed into a tweed jacket, and
lit a pipe. I fetched a dressing-gown from my bedroom and flung
it on the sofa. "You'd better put that on," I said when he had
finished.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I would rather be unencumbered," he said. "But I should
dearly love a cigarette . . . and a liqueur brandy, if you have
such a thing. That Park of yours is infernally chilly."</p>

<p>I supplied his needs, and he stretched himself in an
arm-chair, with his stockinged feet to the fire.</p>

<p>"You have been very good-humoured, Leithen," he said.
"Valdez--that's my aide-de-camp--will be here presently, and he
will probably be preceded by other guests. But I think I have
time for the short explanation which is your due. You believe
what I told you?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Good. Well, I came to London three weeks ago to raise a loan.
That was a matter of life or death for my big stupid country. I
have succeeded. This afternoon the agreement was signed. I think
I mentioned the amount to you--five million sterling."</p>

<p>He smiled happily and blew a smoke-ring into the air.</p>

<p>"I must tell you that I have enemies. Among my happy people
there are many rascals, and I had to deal harshly with them. 'So
foul a sky clears not without a storm'--that's Shakespeare, isn't
it? I learned it at school. You see, I had Holy Church behind me,
and therefore I had against me all the gentry who call themselves
liberators. Red Masons, anarchists, communists, that sort of
crew. A good many are now reposing beneath the sod, but some of
the worst remain. In particular, six followed me to England with
instructions that I must not return.</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you, Leithen, that I have had a
peculiarly rotten time the last three weeks. It was most
important that nothing should happen to me till the loan was
settled, so I had to lead the sheltered life. It went against the
grain, I assure you, for I prefer the offensive to the defensive.
The English police were very amiable, and I never stirred without
a cordon, your people and my own. The Six wanted to kill me, and
as it is pretty easy to kill anybody if you don't mind being
killed yourself, we had to take rather elaborate precautions. As
it was, I was twice nearly done in. Once my carriage broke down
mysteriously, and a crowd collected, and if I hadn't had the luck
to board a passing cab, I should have had a knife in my ribs. The
second was at a public dinner--something not quite right about
the cayenne pepper served with the oysters. One of my staff is
still seriously ill."</p>

<p>He stretched his arms.</p>

<p>"Well, that first stage is over. They can't wreck the loan,
whatever happens to me. Now I am free to adopt different tactics
and take the offensive. I have no fear of the Six in my own
country. There I can take precautions, and they will find it
difficult to cross the frontier or to live for six hours
thereafter if they succeed. But here you are a free people, and
protection is not so easy. I do not wish to leave England just
yet--I have done my work and have earned a little play. I know
your land and love it, and I look forward to seeing something of
my friends. Also I want to attend the Grand National. Therefore,
it is necessary that my enemies should be confined for a little,
while I take my holiday. So for this evening I made a plan. I
took the offensive. I deliberately put myself in their
danger."</p>

<p>He turned his dancing eyes towards me, and I have rarely had
such an impression of wild and mirthful audacity.</p>

<p>"We have an excellent intelligence system," he went on, "and
the Six have been assiduously shadowed. But as I have told you,
no precautions avail against the fanatic, and I do not wish to be
killed on my little holiday. So I resolved to draw their fire--to
expose myself as ground bait, so to speak, that I might have the
chance of netting them. The Six usually hunt in couples, so it
was necessary to have three separate acts in the play, if all
were to be gathered in. The first--"</p>

<p>"Was in Bryanston Square," I put in, "outside Lady Nantley's
house?"</p>

<p>"True. How did you know?"</p>

<p>"I have just been dining there, and heard that you were
expected. I saw the crowd in the square as I came away."</p>

<p>"It seems to have gone off quite nicely. We took pains to let
it be known where I was dining. The Six, who mistrust me,
delegated only two of their number for the job. They never put
all their eggs in one basket. The two gentlemen were induced to
make a scene, and, since they proved to be heavily armed, were
taken into custody and may get a six months' sentence. Very
prettily managed, but unfortunately it was the two that matter
least--the ones we call Little Pedro and Alejandro the Scholar.
Impatient, blundering children, both of them. That leaves
four."</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang, and he made a long arm for the
receiver. The news he got seemed to be good, for he turned a
smiling face to me.</p>

<p>"I should have said two. My little enterprise in the Park has
proved a brilliant success. . . . But I must explain. I was to be
the bait for my enemies, so I showed myself to the remaining
four. That was really rather a clever piece of business. They
lost me at the Marble Arch and they did not recognise me as the
scarecrow sitting on the seat in the rain. But they knew I had
gone to earth there, and they stuck to the scent like terriers.
Presently they would have found me, and there would have been
shooting. Some of my own people were in the shadow between the
road and the railings."</p>

<p>"When I saw you, were your enemies near?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Two were on the opposite side of the road. One was standing
under the lamp-post at the gate. I don't know where the fourth
was at that moment. But all had passed me more than once. . . .
By the way, you very nearly got yourself shot, you know. When you
asked me if sixpence was any good to me. . . . That happens to be
their password. I take great credit to myself for seeing
instantly that you were harmless."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave the Park if you had your trap so well
laid?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because it meant dealing with all four together at once, and
I do them the honour of being rather nervous about them. They are
very quick with their guns. I wanted a chance to break up the
covey, and your arrival gave it me. When I went off two followed,
as I thought they would. My car was in Park Lane, and gave me a
lift; and one of them saw me in it. I puzzled them a little, but
by now they must be certain. You see, my car has been waiting for
some minutes outside this house."</p>

<p>"What about the other two?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Burton has just telephoned that they have been gathered in.
Quite an exciting little scrap. To your police it must have
seemed a bad case of highway robbery--two ruffianly looking
fellows hold up a peaceful elderly gentleman returning from
dinner. The odds were not quite like that, but the men I had on
the job are old soldiers of the Indian wars and can move softly.
. . . I only wish I knew which two they have got. Burton was not
sure. Alcaza is one, but I can't be certain about the other. I
hope it is not the Irishman."</p>

<p>My bell rang very loud and steadily.</p>

<p>"In a few seconds I shall have solved that problem," he said
gaily. "I am afraid I must trouble you to open the door,
Leithen."</p>

<p>"Is it your aide-de-camp?"</p>

<p>"No. I instructed Valdez to knock. It is the residuum of the
Six. Now, listen to me, my friend. These two, whoever they are,
have come here to kill me, and I don't mean to be killed. . . .
My first plan was to have Valdez here--and others--so that my two
enemies should walk into a trap. But I changed my mind before I
telephoned. They are very clever men and by this time they will
be very wary. So I have thought of something else."</p>

<p>The bell rang again and a third time insistently.</p>

<p>"Take these," and he held out a pair of cruel little bluish
revolvers. "When you open the door, you will say that the
President is at home and, in token of his confidence, offers them
these. <i>'Une esp&egrave;ce d'Irlandais, Messieurs. Vous
commences trop tard, et vous finisses trop t&ocirc;t.'</i> Then
bring them here. Quick now. I hope Corbally is one of them."</p>

<p>I did exactly as I was told. I cannot say that I had any
liking for the task, but I was a good deal under the spell of
that calm young man, and I was resigned to my flat being made a
rendezvous for desperadoes. I had locked and chained and bolted
the door, so it took me a few moments to open it.</p>

<p>I found myself looking at emptiness.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" I called. "Who rang?"</p>

<p>I was answered from behind me. It was the quickest thing I
have ever seen, for they must have slipped through in the moment
when my eyes were dazzled by the change from the dim light of the
hall to the glare of the landing. That gave me some notion of the
men we had to deal with.</p>

<p>"Here," said the voice. I turned and saw two men in
waterproofs and felt hats, who kept their hands in their pockets
and had a fraction of an eye on the two pistols I swung by the
muzzles.</p>

<p>"M. le President will be glad to see you, gentlemen," I said.
I held out the revolvers, which they seemed to grasp and flick
into their pockets with a single movement. Then I repeated slowly
the piece of rudeness in French.</p>

<p>One of the men laughed. "Ramon does not forget," he said. He
was a young man with sandy hair and hot blue eyes and an odd
break in his long drooping nose. The other was a wiry little
fellow, with a grizzled beard and what looked like a stiff
leg.</p>

<p>I had no guess at my friend's plan, and was concerned to do
precisely as I was told. I opened the door of my sitting-room,
and noticed that the President was stretched on my sofa facing
the door. He was smoking and was still in his underclothes. When
the two men behind me saw that he was patently unarmed they
slipped into the room with a quick cat-like movement, and took
their stand with their backs against the door.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Corbally," said the President pleasantly. "And you,
Manuel. You're looking younger than when I saw you last. Have a
cigarette?" and he nodded towards my box on the table behind him.
Both shook their heads.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you have come. You have probably seen the news of
the loan in the evening papers. That should give you a holiday,
as it gives me one. No further need for the hectic oversight of
each other, which is so wearing and takes up so much time."</p>

<p>"No," said the man called Manuel, and there was something very
grim about his quiet tones. "We shall take steps to prevent any
need for that in the future."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut--that is your old self, Manuel. You are too fond of
melodrama to be an artist. You are a priest at heart."</p>

<p>The man snarled. "There will be no priest at your death-bed."
Then to his companion. "Let us get this farce over."</p>

<p>The President paid not the slightest attention but looked
steadily at the Irishman. "You used to be a sportsman, Mike. Have
you come to share Manuel's taste for potting the sitting
rabbit?"</p>

<p>"We are not sportsmen, we are executioners of justice," said
Manuel.</p>

<p>The President laughed merrily. "Superb! The best Roman
manner." He still kept his eyes on Corbally.</p>

<p>"Damn you, what's your game, Ramon?" the Irishman asked. His
freckled face had become very red.</p>

<p>"Simply to propose a short armistice. I want a holiday. If you
must know, I want to go to the National."</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"Well, let's call a truce. Say for two months or till I leave
England--whichever period shall be the shorter. After that you
can get busy again."</p>

<p>The one he had named Manuel broke into a spluttering torrent
of Spanish, and for a little they all talked that language. It
sounded like a commination service on the President, to which he
good-humouredly replied. I had never seen this class of ruffian
before, to whom murder was as simple as shooting a partridge, and
I noted curiously the lean hands, the restless wary eyes, and the
ugly lips of the type. So far as I could make out, the President
seemed to be getting on well with the Irishman but to be having
trouble with Manuel.</p>

<p>"Have ye really and truly nothing on ye?" Corbally asked.</p>

<p>The President stretched his arms and revealed his slim figure
in its close-fitting pants and vest.</p>

<p>"Nor him there?" and he nodded towards me.</p>

<p>"He is a lawyer; he doesn't use guns."</p>

<p>"Then I'm damned if I touch ye. Two months it is. What's your
fancy for Liverpool?"</p>

<p>This was too much for Manuel. I saw in what seemed to be one
movement his hand slip from his pocket, Corbally's arm swing in a
circle, and a plaster bust of Julius C&aelig;sar tumble off the
top of my bookcase. Then I heard the report.</p>

<p>"Ye nasty little man," said Corbally as he pressed him to his
bosom in a bear's hug.</p>

<p>"You are a traitor," Manuel shouted. "How will we face the
others? What will Alejandro say and Alcaza--?"</p>

<p>"I think I can explain," said the President pleasantly. "They
won't know for quite a time, and then only if you tell them. You
two gentlemen are all that remain for the moment of your
patriotic company. The other four have been the victims of the
English police--two in Bryanston Square, and two in the Park
close to the Marble Arch."</p>

<p>"Ye don't say!" said Corbally with admiration in his voice.
"Faith, that's smart work!"</p>

<p>"They too will have a little holiday. A few months to meditate
on politics, while you and I go to the Grand National."</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sharp rat-tat at my door. It was like the
knocking in <i>Macbeth</i> for dramatic effect. Corbally had one
pistol at my ear in an instant, while a second covered the
President.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said the latter, never moving a muscle.
"It's General Valdez, whom I think you know. That was another
argument which I was coming to if I hadn't had the good fortune
to appeal to Mr. Corbally's higher nature. I know you have sworn
to kill me, but I take it that the killer wants to have a
sporting chance of escape. Well, there wouldn't have been the
faintest shadow of a chance here. Valdez is at the door, and the
English police are below. You are brave men, I know, but even
brave men dislike the cold gallows."</p>

<p>The knocker fell again. "Let him in, Leithen," I was told, "or
he will be damaging your valuable door. He has not the northern
phlegm of you and me and Mr. Corbally."</p>

<p>A tall man in an ulster, which looked as if it covered a
uniform, stood on the threshold. Someone had obscured the lights
on the landing so that the staircase was dark, but I could see in
the gloom other figures. "President Pelem," he began . . .</p>

<p>"The President is here," I said. "Quite well and in great
form. He is entertaining two other guests."</p>

<p>The General marched to my sitting-room. I was behind him and
did not see his face, but I can believe that it showed surprise
when he recognised the guests. Manuel stood sulkily defiant, his
hands in his waterproof pockets, but Corbally's light eyes were
laughing.</p>

<p>"I think you know each other," said the President
graciously.</p>

<p>"My God!" Valdez seemed to choke at the sight. "These swine! .
. . Excellency, I have--"</p>

<p>"You have nothing of the kind. These are friends of mine for
the next two months, and Mr. Corbally and I are going to the
Grand National together. Will you have the goodness to conduct
them downstairs and explain to the inspector of police below that
all has gone well and that I am perfectly satisfied, and that he
will hear from me in the morning? . . . One moment. What about a
stirrup-cup? Leithen, does your establishment run to a whisky and
soda all round?"</p>

<p>It did. We all had a drink, and I believe I clinked glasses
with Manuel.</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>I looked in at Lady Samplar's dance as I had meant to.
Presently I saw a resplendent figure arrive--the President, with
the ribbon of the Gold Star of Bolivar across his chest. He was
no more the larky undergraduate, but the responsible statesman,
the father of his country. There was a considerable crowd in his
vicinity when I got near him and he was making his apologies to
Mollie Nantley. She saw me and insisted on introducing me. "I so
much wanted you two to meet. I had hoped it would be at my
dinner--but anyhow I have managed it." I think she was a little
surprised when the President took my hand in both of his. "I saw
Mr. Leithen play at Lord's in '97," he said. "I was twelfth man
for Harrow that year. It is delightful to make his acquaintance,
I shall never forget this meeting."</p>

<p>"How English he is!" Mollie whispered to me as we made our way
out of the crowd.</p>

<p>They got him next year. They were bound to, for in that kind
of business you can have no real protection. But he managed to
set his country on its feet before he went down. . . . No, it was
neither Manuel nor Corbally. I think it was Alejandro the
Scholar.</p>

<h1>SHIP TO TARSHISH</h1>

<h1><i>RALPH COLLATT'S STORY</i></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
saying, Arise, go to Nineveh. . . . But Jonah . . . found a ship
going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down
into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the
Lord.--<i>Jonah</i> i. 1-3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The talk one evening turned on the metaphysics of courage. It
is a subject which most men are a little shy of discussing. They
will heartily applaud a friend's pluck, but it is curious how
rarely they will label a man a coward. Perhaps the reason is that
we are all odd mixtures of strength and weakness, brave in
certain things, timid in others; and since each is apt to
remember his private funks more vividly than the things about
which he is bold, we are chary about dogmatising.</p>

<p>Lamancha propounded the thesis that everybody had a yellow
streak in them. We all, he said, at times shirk unpleasant
duties, and invent an honourable explanation, which we know to be
a lie.</p>

<p>Sandy Arbuthnot observed that the most temerarious deeds were
often done by people who had begun by funking, and then, in the
shame of the rebound, did a good deal more than those who had no
qualms. "The man who says I go not, and afterwards repents and
goes, generally travels the devil of a long way."</p>

<p>"Like Jonah," said Lamancha, "who didn't like the job allotted
him, and took ship to Tarshish to get away from it, and then
repented and went like a raging lion to Nineveh."</p>

<p>Collatt, who had been a sailor and one of the Q-boat heroes in
the War, demurred. "I wonder if Nineveh was as unpleasant as the
whale's belly," he said. Then he told us a story in illustration,
not as one would have expected, out of his wild sea memories, but
from his experience in the City, where he was now a
bill-broker.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I got to know Jim Hallward first when he had just come down
from the University. He was a tall, slim, fair-haired lad, with a
soft voice and the kind of manners which make the ordinary man
feel a lout. Eton and Christ Church had polished him till he
fairly glistened. His clothes were sober works of art, and he was
the cleanest thing you ever saw--always seemed to have just
shaved and bathed after a couple of hours' hard exercise. We all
liked him, for he was a companionable soul and had no frills, but
in the City he was about as useless as a lily in a quickset
hedge. Somebody called him an "apolaustic epicene," which sounded
accurate, though I don't know what the words mean. He used to
come down to business about eleven o'clock and leave at
four--earlier in summer, when he played polo at Hurlingham.</p>

<p>This lotus-eating existence lasted for two years. His father
was the head of Hallwards, the merchant-bankers who had been in
existence since before the Napoleonic wars. It was an
old-fashioned private firm with a tremendous reputation, but for
some years it had been dropping a little out of the front rank.
It had very few of the big issues, and, though reckoned as solid
as the Bank of England, it had hardly kept pace with new
developments. But just about the time Jim came down from Oxford
his father seemed to get a new lease of life. Hallwards suddenly
became ultra-progressive, took in a new manager from one of the
big joint-stock banks, and launched out into business which
before it would not have touched with the end of a barge-pole. I
fancy the old man wanted to pull up the firm before he died, so
as to leave a good thing to his only child.</p>

<p>In this new activity Jim can't have been of much use. His
other engagements did not leave him a great deal of time to
master the complicated affairs of a house like Hallwards. He
spoke of his City connection with a certain distaste. The set he
had got into were mostly eldest sons with political ambitions,
and if Jim had any serious inclination it was towards Parliament,
which he proposed to enter in a year or two. For the rest he
played polo, and hunted, and did a little steeple-chasing, and
danced assiduously. Dancing was about the only thing he did
really well, for he was only a moderate horseman and his politics
were not to be taken seriously. So he was the complete
<i>fl&acirc;neur,</i> agreeable, popular, beautifully mannered,
highly ornamental, and the most useless creature on earth. You
see, he had slacked at school, and had just scraped through
college, and had never done a real piece of work in his life.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 192--, whispers began to circulate about
Hallwards. It seemed that they were doing a very risky class of
business, and people shrugged their shoulders. But no one was
prepared for the almighty crash which came at the beginning of
the New Year. The firm had been trying to get control of a
colonial railway, and for this purpose was quietly buying up the
ordinary stock. But an American group, with unlimited capital,
was out on the same tack, and the result was that the price was
forced up, and Hallwards were foolish enough to go on buying.
They borrowed up to the limit of their capacity, and called a
halt too late. If the thing had been known in time the City might
have made an effort to keep the famous old firm on its legs, but
it all came like a thunderclap. Hallwards went down, the American
group got their railway stock at a knock-out price, and old Mr.
Hallward, who had been ailing for some months, had a stroke of
paralysis and died.</p>

<p>I was desperately sorry for Jim. The foundations of his world
were upset, and he hadn't a notion what to do about it. You see,
he didn't know the rudiments of the business, and couldn't be
made to understand it. He went about in a dream, with staring,
unseeing eyes, like a puzzled child. At first he screwed himself
up to a sort of effort. He had many friends who would help, he
thought, and he made various suggestions, all of a bottomless
futility. Very soon he found that his Mayfair popularity was no
sort of asset to him. He must have realised that people were
beginning to turn a colder eye on a pauper than on an eligible
young man, and his overtures were probably met with curt
refusals. Anyhow, in a week he had given up hope. He felt himself
a criminal and behaved as such. He saw nobody but his solicitors,
and when he met a friend in the street he turned and ran. A
perfectly unreasonable sense of disgrace took possession of him,
and there was a moment when I was afraid he might put an end to
himself.</p>

<p>This went on for the better part of a month, while I and one
or two others were trying to save something from the smash. We
put up a fund and bought some of the wreckage, with the idea of
getting together a little company to nurse it. It was important
to do something, for though Jim was an only child and his mother
was dead, there were various elderly female relatives who had
their incomes from Hallwards. The firm had been much respected
and old Hallward had been popular, and Jim had no enemies. There
is a good deal of camaraderie in the City, and a lot of us were
willing to combine and keep Jim going. We were all ready to help
him, if he would only sit down and put his back into the job.</p>

<p>But that was just what Jim would not do. He had got a horror
of the City, and felt a pariah whenever he met anybody who knew
about the crash. He had eyes like a hunted hare's, and one
couldn't get any sense out of him. I don't think he minded the
change in his comforts--the end of polo and hunting and politics,
and the prospect of cheap lodgings and long office hours. I
believe he welcomed all that as a kind of atonement. It was the
disgrace of the thing that came between him and his sleep. He
knew only enough of the City to have picked up a wrong notion of
its standards, and imagined that everybody was pointing a finger
at him as a fool, and possibly a crook.</p>

<p>It was very little use reasoning with him. I pointed out that
the right thing for him to do was to shoulder the burden and
retrieve his father's credit. He laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Much good I'd be at that," he said. "You know I'm a baby in
business, though you're too polite to tell me so."</p>

<p>"You can have a try," I said. "We'll all lend you a hand."</p>

<p>It was no use. References to his father and the firm's ancient
prestige and his old great-aunts only made him shiver. You could
see that his misery made him blind to argument. Then I began to
lose my temper. I told him that it was his duty as a man to face
the music. I asked him what else he proposed to do.</p>

<p>He said he meant to go to Canada and start life anew. He would
probably change his name. I got out of patience with his
silliness.</p>

<p>"You're offered a chance here to make good," I told him. "In
Canada you'll have to find your chance, and how in God's name are
you going to do it? You haven't been bred the right way to
succeed in the Dominions. You'll probably starve."</p>

<p>"Quite likely," was his dismal answer. "I'll make my book for
that. I don't mind anything so long as I'm in a place where
nobody knows me."</p>

<p>"Remember, you are running away," I said, "running away from
what I consider your plain duty. You can't expect to win out if
you begin by funking."</p>

<p>"I know--I know," he wailed. "I am a coward."</p>

<p>I said no more, for when a man is willing to admit that he is
a coward his nerves have got the better of his reason.</p>

<p>Well, the upshot was that Jim sailed for Canada with a little
short of two hundred pounds in his pocket--what was left of his
last allowance. He could have had plenty of introductions, but he
wouldn't take them. He seemed to be determined to bury himself,
and I daresay, too, he got a morbid satisfaction out of
discomfort. He had still the absurd notion of disgrace, and felt
that any handicap he laid on himself was a kind of atonement.</p>

<p>He reached Montreal in the filthy weeks when the spring thaw
begins--the worst sample of weather to be found on the globe. Jim
had not procured any special outfit, and he landed with a kit
consisting of two smart tweed suits, a suit of flannels, riding
breeches and knickerbockers--the remnants of his London wardrobe.
It wasn't quite the rig for a poor man to go looking for a job
in. He had travelled steerage, and, as might have been expected
from one in his condition, had not made friends, but he had
struck up a tepid acquaintanceship with an Irishman who was
employed in a lumber business. The fellow was friendly, and was
struck by Jim's obvious air of education and good-breeding, so,
when he heard that he wanted work, he suggested that a clerkship
might be got in his firm.</p>

<p>Jim applied, and was taken on as the clerk in charge of
timber-cutting rights in Eastern Quebec. The work was purely
mechanical, and simply meant keeping a record of numbered lots,
checking them off on the map, and filling in the details in the
register as they came to hand. But it required accuracy and
strict attention, and Jim had little of either. Besides, he wrote
the vile fist which is the special privilege of our public
schools. He held down the job for a fortnight and then was
fired.</p>

<p>He had found cheap lodgings in a boarding-house down east, and
trudged the two miles in the slush to his office. His
fellow-lodgers were willing enough to be friendly--clerks and
shop-boys and typists and newspaper reporters most of them. Jim
wasn't a snob, but he was rapidly becoming a hermit, for all his
nerves were exposed and he shrank from his fellows. His shyness
was considered English swank, and the others invented nicknames
for him and sniggered when he appeared. Luckily he was too
miserable to pay much attention. He had no interest in their
games, their visits to the movies and to cheap dance-halls, and
their precocious sweethearting. He could not get the hang of
their knowing commercial jargon. They set him down as a snob, and
he shrank from them as barbarians.</p>

<p>But there was one lodger, a sub-editor on a paper which I
shall call the <i>Evening Hawk,</i> who saw a little farther than
the rest. He realised that Jim was an educated man--a "scholar"
he called it, and he managed to get part of his confidence. So
when Jim lost his lumber job he was offered a billet on the
<i>Hawk.</i> There was no superfluity of men of his type in local
journalism, and the editor thought it might give tone to his
paper to have someone on the staff who could write decent English
and keep them from making howlers about Europe. The <i>Hawk</i>
was a lively, up-to-date production, very much Americanised in
its traditions and its literary style, but it had just acquired
some political influence and it hankered after more.</p>

<p>But Jim was no sort of success in journalism. He was tried out
in a variety of jobs--as reporter, special correspondent,
sub-editor--but he failed to give satisfaction in any. To begin
with he had no news-sense. Not many things interested him in his
present frame of mind, and he had no notion what would interest
the <i>Hawk's</i> readers. He couldn't compose snappy headlines,
and it made him sick to try. His writing was no doubt a great
deal more correct than that of his colleagues, but it was dull as
ditch-water. To add to everything else he was desperately casual.
It was not that he meant to be slack, but that he had no stimulus
to make him concentrate his attention, and he was about the worst
sub-editor, I fancy, in the history of the press.</p>

<p>Summer came, and sleet and icy winds gave place to dust and
heat. Jim tramped the grilling streets, one vast ache of
home-sickness. He had to stick to his tweeds, for his flannel
suit had got lost in his journeys between boarding-houses, and,
as he mopped his brow in the airless newspaper rooms smelling of
printers' ink and shaken by the great presses, he thought of
green lawns at Hurlingham, and cool backwaters of the Isis, and
clipped yew hedges in old gardens, and a pleasant club window
overlooking St. James's Street. He hungered for fresh air, but
when on a Sunday morning he went for a long walk, he found no
pleasure in the adjacent countryside. It all seemed dusty and
tousled and unhomely. He wasn't complaining, for it seemed to him
part of a rightful expiation, but he was very lonely and
miserable.</p>

<p>I have said that he had landed with a couple of hundred
pounds, and this he had managed to keep pretty well intact. One
day at a quick-luncheon counter he got into talk with a man
called McNee, a Manitoban who had fought in the War, and knew
something about horses. McNee, like Jim, did not take happily to
town life, and was very sick of his job with an automobile
company, and looking about for a better. There was not much in
common between the two men, except a dislike of Montreal, for I
picture McNee as a rough diamond, an active enterprising fellow
meant by Providence for a backwoodsman. He had heard of a big dam
somewhere down in the Gasp&eacute; district, which was being
constructed in connection with a pulp scheme. He knew one of the
foremen, and believed that money might be made by anyone who
could put up a little capital and run a store in the construction
camp. He told Jim that it was a fine wild country with plenty of
game in the woods, and that, besides making money easily, a
storekeeper could have a white man's life. But every bit of a
thousand dollars capital would be needed, and he could only lay
his hands on a couple of hundred. To Jim in his stuffy
lodging-house the scheme offered a blessed escape. He wanted to
make money, he wanted fresh air and trees and running water, for
your Englishman, though town-bred, always hankers after the
country. So he gave up his job on the <i>Hawk,</i> just when it
was about to give him up, and started out with McNee.</p>

<p>The place was his first disappointment. It was an ugly
clearing in an interminable forest of dull spruces, which ran
without a break to New Brunswick. However far you walked there
was nothing to see except the low muffled hills and the
monotonous green of the firs. The partners were given a big shack
for their store, and made their sleeping quarters in one end of
it. For stock they had laid in a quantity of tinned goods,
tobacco, shirts and socks and boots, and a variety of musical
instruments. But they found that most of their stuff was
unmarketable, since the men were well fed and clothed by the
company, and after a week their store had become a rough kind of
caf&eacute;, selling hot-dogs and ice-cream and soft drinks.
McNee was immensely proud of it and ornamented the walls with
"ideal faces" from the American magazines. He was a born
restaurant keeper, if he had got his chance, but unfortunately
there was not much profit in coco-cola and gingerade.</p>

<p>In about a fortnight the place became half eating-house, half
club, where the workmen gathered of an evening to play cards.
McNee was in his element, but Jim was no more use than a sick
pup. He didn't understand the lingo, and his shyness and
absorption made him as unpopular as in the Montreal
boarding-houses. He saw his little capital slipping away, and
there was no compensation in the way of a pleasant life. He tried
to imitate McNee's air of hearty bonhomie, and miserably failed.
His partner was a good fellow, and stood up for him when an irate
navvy consigned him to perdition as a "God-darned London dude,"
and Jim's own good temper and sense of only getting what he
deserved did something to protect him. But he soon realised that
he was a ghastly failure, and this knowledge prevented him
expostulating with the other for his obvious shortcomings. For
McNee soon became too much of a social success. Gasp&eacute; was
not "dry," and there was more than soft drinks consumed in the
store, especially by the joint-proprietor and his friend the
foreman. Also McNee was a bit of a gambler and was perpetually
borrowing small sums from capital to meet his losses.</p>

<p>Now and then Jim took a holiday, and tramped all of a long
summer day. The country around being only partially surveyed,
there was no map to be had, and he repeatedly lost himself. Once
he struck a lumber camp and was given pork and beans by cheerful
French-Canadians whose <i>patois</i> he could not follow. Once he
had almost a happy day, when he saw his first moose. But
generally he came back from stifling encounters with cedar swamps
and <i>bois brul&eacute;,</i> weary but unrefreshed. He was not
in the frame of mind to get much comfort out of the Canadian
wilds, for he was always sore with longing for a different kind
of landscape.</p>

<p>The river on which the camp lay was the famous Maouchi, and
twelve miles down on the St. Lawrence shore was a big
fishing-lodge owned by a rich New Yorker. Jim used to see members
of the party--young men in marvellous knickerbockers and young
women in jumpers like Joseph's coat, and he hid himself at the
sight of them. Occasionally a big roadster would pass the store,
conveying fishermen to some of the upper lakes. Once, when he was
feeling specially dispirited after a long hot day, a car stopped
at the door, and two people descended. They came into the store,
and the young man asked for lemonade, declaring that their
tongues were hanging out of their mouths. Happily McNee was there
to serve them, while Jim sheltered behind the curtain of the
sleeping-room. He knew them both. One was a subaltern in the
cavalry with whom he had played bridge in the club, the other was
a girl whom he had danced with. Their workmanlike English
clothes, their quiet clear English voices gave him a bad dose of
homesickness. They were returning, he reflected, to hot baths and
cool clean clothes and delicate food and civilised talk. . . .
For a moment he sickened at the sour stale effluvia of the
eating-house, and the rank smell of the pork which McNee had been
frying. Then he cursed himself for a fool and a child.</p>

<p>In the fall the work on the dam was shut down, and the store
was closed. The partners couldn't remove their unsaleable goods,
so the whole stock was sold at junk prices among the nearest
villages. Jim found himself with about three hundred dollars in
the world, and the long Canadian winter to get through. The fall
on the other side of the Atlantic is the pick of the year, and
the beauty of the flaming hillsides did a little to revive his
spirits. McNee wanted to get back to Manitoba, where he had heard
of a job, and Jim decided that he would try Toronto, which was
supposed to be rather more healthy for Englishmen than the other
cities. So the two travelled west together, and Jim insisted on
paying McNee's fare to Winnipeg, thereby leaving himself a
hundred and fifty dollars or so on which to face the world.</p>

<p>Toronto is the friendliest place on earth for the man who
knows how to make himself at home there. There were plenty to
help him if he had looked for them, for nowhere will you find
more warm-hearted people to the square mile. But Jim's shyness
and prickliness put him outside the pale. He made no effort to
advertise the few assets he had, he was desperately
uncommunicative, and his self-absorption was not unnaturally
taken for "side." Also he made the mistake of letting himself get
a little too far down in the social scale. His clothes had become
very shabby, and his boots were bad; when the first snows came in
November he bought himself a thick overcoat, and that left him no
money to supplement the rest of his wardrobe, so that by
Christmas he was a very good imitation of a tramp.</p>

<p>He tried journalism first, but as he gave no information about
himself except that he had been for a few weeks on the Montreal
<i>Hawk,</i> he had some difficulty in getting a job. At last he
got work on a weekly rag simply because he had some notion of
grammar. It lasted exactly a fortnight. Then he tried tutoring,
and spent some of his last dollars on advertising; he had several
nibbles, but always fell down at the interviews. One kind of
parent jibbed at his superior manners, another at his inferior
clothes. After that he jolted from one temporary job to
another--a book-canvasser, an extra hand in a dry-goods-store in
the Christmas week, where the counter hid the deficiencies of his
raiment, a temporary clerk during a municipal election, a packer
in a fancy-stationery business, and finally a porter in a
third-class hotel. His employment was not continuous, and between
jobs he must have nearly starved. He had begun in the ordinary
cheap boarding-house, but, before he found quarters in the attic
of the hotel he worked at, he had sunk to a pretty squalid kind
of doss-house.</p>

<p>The physical discomfort was bad enough. He tramped the streets
ill-clad and half-fed, and saw prosperous people in furs, and
cheerful young parties, and fire-lit, book-lined rooms. But the
spiritual trouble was worse. Sometimes, when things were very
bad, he was fortunate enough to have his thoughts narrowed down
to the obtaining of food and warmth. But at other times he would
be tormented by a feeling that his misfortunes were deserved, and
that Fate with a heavy hand was belabouring him because he was a
coward. His trouble was no longer the idiotic sense of guilt
about his father's bankruptcy; it was a much more rational
penitence, for he was beginning to realise that I had been right,
and that he had behaved badly in running away from a plain duty.
At first he choked down the thought, but all that miserable
winter it grew upon him. His disasters were a direct visitation
of the Almighty on one who had shown the white feather. He came
to have an almost mystical feeling about it. He felt that he was
branded like Cain, so that everybody knew that he had funked, and
yet he realised that a rotten morbid pride ironly prevented him
from retracing his steps.</p>

<p>The second spring found him thin from bad feeding and with a
nasty cough. He had the sense to see that a summer in that hotel
would be the end of him, so, although he was in the depths of
hopelessness, the instinct of self-preservation drove him to make
a move. He wanted to get into the country, but it was impossible
to get work on a farm from Toronto, and he had no money to pay
for railway fares. In the end he was taken on as a navvy on a bit
of railway construction work in the wilds of northern Ontario. He
was given the price of his ticket and ten dollars advance on his
wages to get an outfit, and one day late in April he found
himself dumped at a railhead on a blue lake, with firs, firs, as
far as the eye could reach. But it was spring-time, the mating
wildfowl were calling, the land was greening, and Jim drew long
breaths of sweet air and felt that he was not going to die just
yet.</p>

<p>But the camp was a roughish place, and he had no McNee to
protect him. There was every kind of roughneck and deadbeat
there, and Jim was a bad mixer. He was an obvious softy and new
chum and a natural butt, and, since he was being tortured all the
time by his conscience, his good nature and humble-mindedness
were not so proof as they had been in Gasp&eacute;. His poor
physical condition made him a bad workman, and he came in for a
good deal of abuse as a slacker from the huskies who wrought
beside him. The section boss was an Irishman called Malone with a
tongue like a whip-lash, and he found plenty of opportunities for
practising his gift on Jim. But he was a just man, and after a
bit of rough-tonguing he saw that Jim was very white about the
gills and told him to show his hands. Not being accustomed to the
pick, these were one mass of sores. Malone cross-examined him,
found that he had been at college, and took him off construction
and put him in charge of stores.</p>

<p>There he had an easier life, but he was more than ever the
butt of the mess shack and the sleeping quarters. His crime was
not only speaking with an English accent and looking like Little
Willie, but being supposed to be a favourite of the boss. By and
by the ragging became unbearable, and after his mug of coffee had
been three times struck out of his hand at one meal, Jim lost his
temper and hit out. In the fight which followed he was
ridiculously out-classed. He had been fairly good at games, but
he had never boxed since his private school, and it is well for
Jim's kind of man to think twice before he takes on a fellow who
has all his life earned his living by his muscles. But he stood
up pluckily, and took a good deal of punishment before he was
knocked out, and he showed no ill-will afterwards. The incident
considerably improved his position. Malone, who heard of it,
asked him where in God's name he had been brought up that he
couldn't use his hands better, but didn't appear ill-pleased. The
fight had another consequence. It gave him just a suspicion of
self-confidence, and helped him on his way to the decision to
which he was slowly being compelled.</p>

<p>A week later he was sent a hundred miles into the forest to
take supplies to an advance survey party. It was something of a
compliment that Malone should have picked him for the job, but
Jim did not realise that. His brain was beating like a pendulum
on his private trouble--that he had run away, that all his
misfortunes were the punishment for his cowardice, and that,
though he confessed his fault, he could not make his shrinking
flesh go back. He saw England as an Eden indeed, but with angels
and flaming swords at every gate. He pictured the lifted eyebrows
and the shrugged shoulders as he crept into a clerk's job, with
not only his father's shame on his head, but the added disgrace
of his own flight. It had seemed impossible a year ago to stay on
in London, but now it was a thousandfold more impossible to go
home.</p>

<p>Yet the thought gave him no peace by day or night. He had six
men in his outfit, two of them half-breeds, and the journey was
partly by canoe--with heavy portages--and partly on foot with the
stores in pack loads. It rained in torrents, the river was in
flood, and the first day they made a bare twenty miles. The
half-breeds were tough old customers, but the other four were not
much to bank on, and on the third day, when they had to hump
their packs and foot it on a bad trail through swampy woods in a
cloud of flies, they decided that they had had enough. There was
a new gold area just opened not so far away, and they announced
that they intended to help themselves to what they wanted from
the stores and then make a bee-line for the mines. They were an
ugly type of tough, and had physically the upper hand of Jim and
his half-breeds.</p>

<p>It was a nasty situation, and it shook Jim out of his private
vexations. He spoke them fair, and proposed to make camp and rest
for a day to talk it out. Privately he sent one of the
half-breeds ahead to the survey-party for help, while he kept his
ruffians in play. Happily he had some whisky with him and he had
them drinking and playing cards, which took him well into the
afternoon. Then they discovered the half-breed's absence, and
wouldn't believe Jim's yarn that he had gone off to find fresh
meat. His only chance was to bluff high, and, since he didn't
much care what happened to him, he succeeded. He went to bed that
night with a tough beside him who had announced his intention of
putting a bullet through his head if there was any dirty work.
Sometime after midnight his messenger arrived with help, and
fortunately his bedside-companion's bullet went wide. The stores,
a bit depleted, were safely delivered, and when Jim got back to
his base he received a solid cursing from his boss for his
defective stewardship. But Malone concluded with one of his rare
compliments. "You'll train on, sonny," he said. "There's guts in
you for all your goo-goo face."</p>

<p>That episode put an end to Jim's indecision. His time in
Canada had been one long chapter of black disasters, and he was
confident that they were sent to him as a punishment. His last
adventure had somehow screwed up his manhood. He hated Canada
like poison, but the thought of going back to England made him
green with apprehension. Yet he was clear that he must do it or
never have a moment's peace. So he wrote to me and told me that
for a year he had been considering things, and had come to the
conclusion that he had behaved like a cad. He was coming back to
get into any kind of harness I directed, and would I advance him
thirty pounds for his journey?</p>

<p>Now the little company we had put together to nurse the
wreckage of Hallwards had been doing rather well. One or two
things had unexpectedly turned up trumps. There was enough money
to keep the maiden aunts going, and it looked as if there would
be a good deal presently for Jim. He had gone off leaving no
address, so I had had no means of communicating with him. I
cabled him a hundred pounds, and told him to come along.</p>

<p>One afternoon near the end of June he turned up in my office.
He had crossed the Atlantic steerage, and his clothes were those
of a docker who has been months out of work. The first thing he
did was to plank eighty pounds on my desk. "You sent me too
much," he said. "I don't want to owe more than is necessary. You
can stop the twenty quid out of my wages."</p>

<p>At first sight I thought him very little changed in face. He
was incredibly lean and tanned and his hair wanted cutting, but
he had the same shy, hunted eyes as the boy who had bolted a year
before. He did not seem to have won any self-confidence, except
that the set of his mouth was a little firmer.</p>

<p>"I want to start work at once," he said. "I've come home to
make atonement."</p>

<p>It took me a long time to make him understand the position of
affairs--that he could count even now on a respectable income,
and that, if he put his back into it, Hallwards might once again
become a power in the City. "I was only waiting for you to come
back," I said, "to revive the old name. Hallwards has a better
sound than the Anglo-Orient Company."</p>

<p>"But I can't touch a penny," he said. "What about the people
who suffered through the bankruptcy?"</p>

<p>"There were very few," I told him. "None of the
widow-and-orphan business. The banks were amply secured. The
chief sufferers were your aunts and yourself, and that's going to
be all right now."</p>

<p>He listened with wide eyes, and slowly bewilderment gave place
to relief, and relief to rapture. "The first thing you've got to
do," I said, "is to go to your tailor and get some clothes. You'd
better put up at an hotel till you can find a flat. I'll see
about your club membership. If you want to play polo I'll lend
you a couple of ponies. Come and dine with me to-night and tell
me your story."</p>

<p>"My God!" he murmured. "Do you realise that for a year I've
been on my uppers? That's my story."</p>

<p>The rest of that summer Jim walked about in a happy
mystification. Once he was decently dressed, I could see that
Canada had improved him. He was better-looking, tougher, manlier;
his shyness was now wariness and he had got a new and sounder
code of values. He worked like a beaver in the office, and,
though he was curiously slow and obtuse about some things, I
began to see that he had his father's brains, and something, too,
that old Hallward had never had, a sensitive, subtle imagination.
For the rest he enjoyed himself. He came in for the end of the
polo season, and he was welcomed back to his old set as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Then I ceased to see much of him. I had been overworking badly
and needed a long holiday, so I went off to a Scotch deer-forest
in the middle of August and did not return till the beginning of
October. Jim stuck tight to the office; he said that he had had
all the holidays he wanted for a year or two.</p>

<p>On the second day after my return he came into my room and
said that he wanted to speak to me privately. He wished, he said,
that nothing should be done about the restoring the name of
Hallwards. He would like the Anglo-Orient to go on just as it was
before he returned, and he did not want the directorship which
had been arranged.</p>

<p>"Why in the world?" I asked in amazement.</p>

<p>"Because I am going away. And I may be away for quite a
time."</p>

<p>When I found words, and that took some time, I asked if he had
grown tired of England.</p>

<p>"Bless you, no! I love it better than any place on earth. The
autumn scents are beginning, and London is snugging down for its
blessed cosy winter, and the hunting will soon be starting, and
last Sunday I heard the old cock pheasants shouting--"</p>

<p>"Where are you going? Canada?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Have you fallen in love with it?"</p>

<p>"I hate it worse than hell," he said solemnly, and proceeded
to say things which in the interest of Imperial good feeling I
refrain from repeating.</p>

<p>"Then you must be mad!"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I'm quite sane. It's very simple, and I've
thought it all out. You know I ran away from my duty eighteen
months ago. Well, I was punished for it. I was a howling failure
in Canada. . . . I haven't told you half . . . I pretty well
starved . . . I couldn't hold down any job . . . I was simply a
waif and a laughing stock. And I loathed it--my God, how I
loathed it! But I couldn't come back--the very thought of facing
London gave me a sick pain. It took me a year to screw up my
courage to do what I knew was my manifest duty. Well, I turned
up, as you know."</p>

<p>"Then that's all right, isn't it?" I observed obtusely. "You
find London better than you thought?"</p>

<p>"I find it Paradise," and he smiled sadly. "But it's a
Paradise I haven't deserved. You see, I made a failure in Canada
and I can't let it go at that. I hate the very name of the place
and most of the people in it. . . . Oh, I daresay there is
nothing wrong with it, but one always hates a place where one has
been a fool . . . I have got to go back and make good. I shall
take two hundred pounds, just what I had when I first started
out."</p>

<p>I only stared, and he went on:</p>

<p>"I funked once, and that may be forgiven. But a man who funks
twice is a coward. I funk Canada like the devil, and that is why
I am going back. There was a man there--only one man--who said I
had guts. I'm going to prove to that whole damned Dominion that I
have guts, but principally I've got to prove it to myself. . . .
After that I'll come back to you, and we'll talk business."</p>

<p>I could say nothing: indeed I didn't want to say anything. Jim
was showing a kind of courage several grades ahead of old
Jonah's. He had returned to Nineveh and found that it had no
terrors, and was now going back to Tarshish, whales and all.</p>

<h1><i>ANTHONY HURRELL'S STORY</i></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who's there, besides foul weather?</p>

<p><i>King Lear.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Mr. Anthony Hurrell was a small man, thin to the point of
emaciation, but erect as a ramrod and wiry as a cairn terrier.
There was no grey in his hair, and his pale far-sighted eyes had
the alertness of youth, but his lean face was so wrinkled by
weather that in certain lights it looked almost venerable, and
young men, who at first sight had imagined him their
contemporary, presently dropped into the "sir" reserved for
indisputable seniors. His actual age was, I believe, somewhere in
the forties. He had inherited a small property in Northumberland,
where he had accumulated a collection of the rarer wildfowl, but
much of his life had been spent in places so remote that his
friends could with difficulty find them on the map. He had
written a dozen ornithological monographs, was joint editor of
the chief modern treatise on British birds, and had been the
first man to visit the <i>tundras</i> of the Yenisei. He spoke
little and that with an agreeable hesitation, but his ready
smile, his quick interest, and the impression he gave of having a
fathomless knowledge of strange modes of life, made him a popular
and intriguing figure among his friends. Of his doings in the War
he told us nothing; what we knew of them--and they were
sensational enough in all conscience--we learned elsewhere. It
was Nightingale's story which drew him from his customary
silence. At the dinner following that event he made certain
comments on current explanations of the supernormal. "I remember
once," he began, and before we knew he had surprised us by
embarking on a tale.</p>

<p>He had scarcely begun before he stopped. "I'm boring you," he
said deprecatingly. "There's nothing much in the story. . . . You
see, it all happened, so to speak, inside my head. . . . I don't
want to seem an egotist. . . ."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Tony," said Lamancha. "Every adventure takes
place chiefly inside the head of somebody. Go on. We're all
attention."</p>

<p>"It happened a good many years ago," Hurrell continued, "when
I was quite a young man. I wasn't the cold scientist then that I
fancy I am to-day. I took up birds in the first instance chiefly
because they fired what imagination I possess. They fascinated
me, for they seemed of all created things the nearest to pure
spirit--those little beings with a normal temperature of
125&ordm;. Think of it. The goldcrest, with a stomach no bigger
than a bean, flies across the North Sea! The curlew sandpiper,
which breeds so far north that only about three people have ever
seen its nest, goes to Tasmania for its holidays! So I always
went bird-hunting with a queer sense of expectation and a bit of
a tremor, as if I was walking very near the boundaries of the
things we are not allowed to know. I felt this especially in the
migration season. The small atoms, coming God knows whence and
going God knows whither, were sheer mystery--they belonged to a
world built in different dimensions from ours. I don't know what
I expected, but I was always waiting for something, as much in a
flutter as a girl at her first ball. You must realise that mood
of mine to understand what follows.</p>

<p>"One year I went to the Norland Islands for the spring
migration. Plenty of people do the same, but I had the notion to
do something a little different. I had a theory that migrants go
north and south on a fairly narrow road. They have their
corridors in the air as clearly defined as a highway, and keep an
inherited memory of these corridors, like the stout conservatives
they are. So I didn't go to the Blue Banks or to Noop or to
Hermaness or any of the obvious places, where birds might be
expected to make their first landfall.</p>

<p>"At that time I was pretty well read in the sagas, and had
taught myself Icelandic for the purpose. Now it is written in the
Saga of Earl Skuli, which is part of the Jarla Saga or Saga of
the Earls, that Skuli, when he was carving out his earldom in the
Scots islands, had much to do with a place called the Isle of the
Birds. It is mentioned repeatedly, and the saga-man has a lot to
say about the amazing multitude of birds there. It couldn't have
been an ordinary gullery, for the Northmen saw too many of these
to think them worth mentioning. I got it into my head that it
must have been one of the alighting places of the migrants, and
was probably as busy a spot to-day as in the eleventh century.
The saga said it was near Halmarsness, and that is on the west
side of the island of Una, so to Una I decided to go. I fairly
got that Isle of Birds on the brain. From the map it might be any
one of a dozen skerries under the shadow of Halmarsness.</p>

<p>"I remember that I spent a good many hours in the British
Museum before I started, hunting up the scanty records of those
parts. I found--I think it was in Adam of Bremen--that a
succession of holy men had lived on the isle, and that a chapel
had been built there and endowed by Earl Rognvald, which came to
an end in the time of Malise of Strathearn. There was a bare
mention of the place, but the chronicler had one curious note.
<i>'Insula Avium,'</i> ran the text, <i>'qu&aelig; est ultima
insula et proximo, Abysso.'</i> I wondered what on earth he
meant. The place was not ultimate in any geographical sense,
neither the farthest north nor the farthest west of the Norlands.
And what was the 'abyss'? In monkish Latin the word generally
means Hell--Bunyan's Bottomless Pit--and sometimes the grave; but
neither meaning seemed to have much to do with an ordinary sea
skerry.</p>

<p>"I arrived at Una about eight o'clock in a May evening, having
been put across from Voss in a flit-boat. It was a quiet evening,
the sky without clouds but so pale as to be almost grey, the sea
grey also but with a certain iridescence in it, and the low lines
of the land a combination of hard greys and umbers, cut into by
the harder white of the lighthouse. I can never find words to
describe that curious quality of light that you get up in the
North. Sometimes it is like looking at the world out of deep
water--Farquharson used to call it 'milky,' and one saw what he
meant. Generally it is a sort of essence of light, cold and pure
and distilled, as if it were reflected from snow. There is no
colour in it, and it makes thin shadows. Some people find it
horribly depressing--Farquharson said it reminded him of a
churchyard in the early morning where all his friends were
buried--but personally I found it tonic and comforting. But it
made me feel very near the edge of the world.</p>

<p>"There was no inn, so I put up at the post-office, which was
on a causeway between a freshwater loch and a sea voe, so that
from the doorstep you could catch brown trout on one side and
sea-trout on the other. Next morning I set off for Halmarsness,
which lay five miles to the west over a flat moorland all puddled
with tiny lochans. There seemed to be nearly as much water as
land. Presently I came to a bigger loch under the lift of ground
which was Halmarsness. There was a gap in the ridge through which
I looked straight out to the Atlantic, and there in the middle
distance was what I knew instinctively to be my island.</p>

<p>"It was perhaps a quarter of a mile long, low for the most
part, but rising in the north to a grassy knoll beyond the reach
of any tides. In parts it narrowed to a few yards' width, and the
lower levels must often have been awash. But it was an island,
not a reef, and I thought I could make out the remains of the
monkish cell. I climbed Halmarsness, and there, with nesting
skuas swooping angrily about my head, I got a better view. It was
certainly my island, for the rest of the archipelago were
inconsiderable skerries, and I realised that it might well be a
resting-place for migrants, for the mainland cliffs were too
thronged with piratical skuas and other jealous fowl to be
comfortable for weary travellers.</p>

<p>"I sat for a long time on the headland looking down from the
three hundred feet of basalt to the island half a mile off--the
last bit of solid earth between me and Greenland. The sea was
calm for Norland waters, but there was a snowy edging of surf to
the skerries which told of a tide rip. Two miles farther south I
could see the entrance to the famous Roost of Una, where, when
tide and wind collide, there is a wall like a house, so that a
small steamer cannot pass it. The only sign of human habitation
was a little grey farm in the lowlands toward the Roost, but the
place was full of the evidence of man--a herd of Norland ponies,
each tagged with its owner's name--grazing sheep of the piebald
Norland breed--a broken barbed-wire fence that drooped over the
edge of the cliff. I was only an hour's walk from a telegraph
office, and a village which got its newspapers not more than
three days late. It was a fine spring noon, and in the empty
bright land there was scarcely a shadow. . . . All the same, as I
looked down at the island I did not wonder that it had been
selected for attention by the saga-man and had been reputed holy.
For it had an air of concealing something, though it was as bare
as a billiard-table. It was an intruder, an irrelevance in the
picture, planted there by some celestial caprice. I decided
forthwith to make my camp on it, and the decision, inconsequently
enough, seemed to me to be something of a venture.</p>

<p>"That was the view taken by John Ronaldson, when I talked to
him after dinner. John was the post-mistress's son, more
fisherman than crofter, like all Norlanders, a skilful sailor and
an adept at the dipping lug, and noted for his knowledge of the
western coast. He had difficulty in understanding my plan, and
when he identified my island he protested.</p>

<p>"'Not Skule Skerry!' he cried. 'What would take ye there, man?
Ye'll get a' the birds ye want on Halmarsness and a far better
bield. Ye'll be blawn away on the skerry, if the wund rises.'</p>

<p>"I explained to him my reasons as well as I could, and I
answered his fears about a gale by pointing out that the island
was sheltered by the cliffs from the prevailing winds, and could
be scourged only from the south, south-west, or west, quarters
from which the wind rarely blew in May. 'It'll be cauld,' he
said, 'and wat.' I pointed out that I had a tent and was
accustomed to camping. 'Ye'll starve'--I expounded my proposed
methods of commissariat. 'It'll be an ill job getting ye on and
off'--but after cross-examination he admitted that ordinarily the
tides were not difficult, and that I could get a row-boat to a
beach below the farm I had seen--its name was Sgurravoe. Yet when
I had said all this he still raised objections, till I asked him
flatly what was the matter with Skule Skerry.</p>

<p>"'Naebody gangs there,' he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"'Why should they?' I asked. 'I'm only going to watch the
birds.'</p>

<p>"But the fact that it was never visited seemed to stick in his
throat and he grumbled out something that surprised me. 'It has
an ill name,' he said. But when I pressed him he admitted that
there was no record of shipwreck or disaster to account for the
ill name. He repeated the words 'Skule Skerry' as if they
displeased him. 'Folk dinna gang near it. It has aye had an ill
name. My grandfather used to say that the place wasna canny.'</p>

<p>"Now your Norlander has nothing of the Celt in him, and is as
different from the Hebridean as a Northumbrian from a Cornishman.
They are a fine, upstanding, hard-headed race, almost pure
Scandinavian in blood, but they have as little poetry in them as
a Manchester radical. I should have put them down as utterly free
from superstition, and, in all my many visits to the islands I
have never yet come across a folk-tale--hardly even a historical
legend. Yet here was John Ronaldson, with his weather-beaten face
and stiff chin and shrewd blue eyes, declaring that an
innocent-looking island 'wasna canny,' and showing the most
remarkable disinclination to go near it.</p>

<p>"Of course all this only made me keener. Besides, it was
called Skule Skerry, and the name could only come from Earl
Skuli; so it was linked up authentically with the oddments of
information I had collected in the British Museum--the Jarla Saga
and Adam of Bremen and all the rest of it. John finally agreed to
take me over next morning in his boat, and I spent the rest of
the day in collecting my kit. I had a small E.P. tent, and a
Wolseley valise and half a dozen rugs, and, since I had brought a
big box of tinned stuffs from the Stores, all I needed was flour
and meal and some simple groceries. I learned that there was a
well on the island, and that I could count on sufficient
driftwood for my fire, but to make certain I took a sack of coals
and another of peats. So I set off next day in John's boat, ran
with the wind through the Roost of Una when the tide was right,
tacked up the coast, and came to the skerry early in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>"You could see that John hated the place. We ran into a cove
on the east side, and he splashed ashore as if he expected to
have his landing opposed, looking all the time sharply about him.
When he carried my stuff to a hollow under the knoll which gave a
certain amount of shelter, his head was always twisting round. To
me the place seemed to be the last word in forgotten peace. The
swell lipped gently on the reefs and the little pebbled beaches,
and only the babble of gulls from Halmarsness broke the
stillness.</p>

<p>"John was clearly anxious to get away, but he did his duty by
me. He helped me to get the tent up, found a convenient place for
my boxes, pointed out the well and filled my water bucket, and
made a zareba of stones to protect my camp on the Atlantic side.
We had brought a small dinghy along with us, and this was to be
left with me, so that when I wanted I could row across to the
beach at Sgurravoe. As his last service he fixed an old pail
between two boulders on the summit of the knoll, and filled it
with oily waste, so that it could be turned into a beacon.</p>

<p>"'Ye'll maybe want to come off,' he said, 'and the boat will
maybe no be there. Kindle your flare, and they'll see it at
Sgurravoe and get the word to me, and I'll come for ye though the
Muckle Black Silkie himsel' was hunkerin' on the skerry.'</p>

<p>"Then he looked up and sniffed the air. 'I dinna like the set
of the sky,' he declared. 'It's a bad weatherhead. There'll be
mair wund than I like in the next four and twenty hours.'</p>

<p>"So saying, he hoisted his sail and presently was a speck on
the water towards the Roost. There was no need for him to hurry,
for the tide was now wrong, and before he could pass the Roost he
would have three hours to wait on this side of the Mull. But the
man, usually so deliberate and imperturbable, had been in a fever
to be gone.</p>

<p>"His departure left me in a curious mood of happy loneliness
and pleasurable expectation. I was left solitary with the seas
and the birds. I laughed to think that I had found a streak of
superstition in the granite John. He and his Muckle Black Silkie!
I knew the old legend of the North which tells how the Finns, the
ghouls that live in the deeps of the ocean, can on occasion don a
seal's skin and come to land to play havoc with mortals. But
<i>diablerie</i> and this isle of mine were worlds apart. I
looked at it as the sun dropped, drowsing in the opal-coloured
tides, under a sky in which pale clouds made streamers like a
spectral <i>aurora borealis,</i> and I thought that I had
stumbled upon one of those places where Nature seems to invite
one to her secrets. As the light died the sky was flecked as with
the roots and branches of some great nebular tree. That would be
the 'weatherhead' of which John Ronaldson had spoken.</p>

<p>"I set my fire going, cooked my supper, and made everything
snug for the night. I had been right in my guess about the
migrants. It must have been about ten o'clock when they began to
arrive--after my fire had died out and I was smoking my last pipe
before getting into my sleeping-bag. A host of fieldfares settled
gently on the south part of the skerry. A faint light lingered
till after midnight, but it was not easy to distinguish the
little creatures, for they were aware of my presence and did not
alight within a dozen yards of me. But I made out bramblings and
buntings and what I thought was the Greenland wheatear; also jack
snipe and sanderling; and I believed from their cries that the
curlew sandpiper and the whimbrel were there. I went to sleep in
a state of high excitement, promising myself a fruitful time on
the morrow.</p>

<p>"I slept badly, as one often does one's first night in the
open. Several times I woke with a start under the impression that
I was in a boat rowing swiftly with the tide. And every time I
woke I heard the flutter of myriad birds, as if a velvet curtain
was being slowly switched along an oak floor. At last I fell into
deeper sleep, and when I opened my eyes it was full day.</p>

<p>"The first thing that struck me was that it had got suddenly
colder. The sky was stormily red in the east, and masses of
woolly clouds were banking in the north. I lit my fire with
numbed fingers and hastily made tea. I could see the nimbus of
seafowl over Halmarsness, but there was only one bird left on my
skerry. I was certain from its forked tail that it was a Sabine's
gull, but before I got my glass out it was disappearing into the
haze towards the north. The sight cheered and excited me, and I
cooked my breakfast in pretty good spirits.</p>

<p>"That was literally the last bird that came near me, barring
the ordinary shearwaters and gulls and cormorants that nested
round about Halmarsness. (There was not one single nest of any
sort on the island. I had heard of that happening before in
places which were regular halting grounds for migrants.) The
travellers must have had an inkling of the coming weather and
were waiting somewhere well to the south. For about 9 o'clock it
began to blow. Great God, how it blew! You must go to the
Norlands if you want to know what wind can be. It is like being
on a mountain-top, for there is no high ground to act as a
wind-break. There was no rain, but the surf broke in showers and
every foot of the skerry was drenched with it. In a trice
Halmarsness was hidden, and I seemed to be in the centre of a
maelstrom, choked with scud and buffeted on every side by
swirling waters.</p>

<p>"Down came my tent at once. I wrestled with the crazy canvas
and got a black eye from a pole, but I managed to drag the ruins
into the shelter of the zareba which John had built, and tumble
some of the bigger boulders on it. There it lay, flapping like a
sick albatross. The water got into my food boxes, and soaked my
fuel, as well as every inch of my clothing. . . . I had looked
forward to a peaceful day of watching and meditation, when I
could write up my notes; and instead I spent a morning like a
Rugger scrum. I might have enjoyed it, if I hadn't been so wet
and cold, and could have got a better lunch than some clammy
mouthfuls out of a tin. One talks glibly about being 'blown off'
a place, generally an idle exaggeration--but that day I came very
near the reality. There were times when I had to hang on for dear
life to one of the bigger stones to avoid being trundled into the
yeasty seas.</p>

<p>"About two o'clock the volume of the storm began to decline,
and then for the first time I thought about the boat. With a
horrid sinking of the heart I scrambled to the cove where we had
beached it. It had been drawn up high and dry, and its painter
secured to a substantial boulder. But now there was not a sign of
it except a ragged rope-end round the stone. The tide had mounted
to its level, and tide and wind had smashed the rotten painter.
By this time what was left of it would be tossing in the
Roost.</p>

<p>"This was a pretty state of affairs. John was due to visit me
next day, but I had a cold twenty-four hours ahead of me. There
was of course the flare he had left me, but I was not inclined to
use this. It looked like throwing up the sponge and confessing
that my expedition had been a farce. I felt miserable, but
obstinate, and, since the weather was clearly mending, I
determined to put the best face on the business, so I went back
to the wreckage of my camp, and tried to tidy up. There was still
far too much wind to do anything with the tent, but the worst of
the spindrift had ceased, and I was able to put out my bedding
and some of my provender to dry. I got a dry jersey out of my
pack, and, as I was wearing fisherman's boots and oilskins, I
managed to get some slight return of comfort. Also at last I
succeeded in lighting a pipe. I found a corner under the knoll
which gave me a modicum of shelter, and I settled myself to pass
the time with tobacco and my own thoughts.</p>

<p>"About three o'clock the wind died away completely. That I did
not like, for a dead lull in the Norlands is often the precursor
of a new gale. Indeed, I never remembered a time when some wind
did not blow, and I had heard that when such a thing happened
people came out of their houses to ask what the matter was. But
now we had the deadest sort of calm. The sea was still wild and
broken, the tides raced by like a mill-stream, and a brume was
gathering which shut out Halmarsness--shut out every prospect
except a narrow circuit of grey water. The cessation of the
racket of the gale made the place seem uncannily quiet. The
present tumult of the sea, in comparison with the noise of the
morning, seemed no more than a mutter and an echo.</p>

<p>"As I sat there I became conscious of an odd sensation. I
seemed to be more alone, more cut off, not only from my fellows
but from the habitable earth, than I had ever been before. It was
like being in a small boat in mid-Atlantic--but worse, if you
understand me, for that would have been loneliness in the midst
of a waste which was nevertheless surrounded and traversed by the
works of man, whereas now I felt that I was clean outside man's
ken. I had come somehow to the edge of that world where life is,
and was very close to the world which has only death in it.</p>

<p>"At first I do not think there was much fear in the
sensation--chiefly strangeness, but the kind of strangeness which
awes without exciting. I tried to shake off the mood, and got up
to stretch myself. There was not much room for exercise, and as I
moved with stiff legs along the reefs I slipped into the water,
so that I got my arms wet. It was cold beyond belief--the very
quintessence of deathly Arctic ice, so cold that it seemed to
sear and bleach the skin.</p>

<p>"From that moment I date the most unpleasant experience of my
life. I became suddenly the prey of a black depression, shot with
the red lights of terror. But it was not a numb terror, for my
brain was acutely alive. . . . I had the sense to try to make
tea, but my fuel was still too damp, and the best I could do was
to pour half the contents of my brandy flask into a cup and
swallow the stuff. That did not properly warm my chilled body,
but--since I am a very temperate man--it speeded up my thoughts
instead of calming them. I felt myself on the brink of a childish
panic.</p>

<p>"One thing I thought I saw clearly--the meaning of Skule
Skerry. By some alchemy of nature, at which I could only guess,
it was on the track by which the North exercised its spell, a
cableway for the magnetism of that cruel frozen Uttermost, which
man might penetrate but could never subdue or understand. Though
the latitude was only 61&deg;, there were folds of tucks in
space, and this isle was the edge of the world. Birds knew it,
and the old Northmen, who were primitive beings like the birds,
knew it. That was why an inconsiderable skerry had been given the
name of a conquering Jarl. The old Church knew it, and had
planted a chapel to exorcise the demons of darkness. I wondered
what sights the hermit, whose cell had been on the very spot
where I was cowering, had seen in the winter dusks.</p>

<p>"It may have been partly the brandy acting on an empty
stomach, and partly the extreme cold, but my brain, in spite of
my efforts to think rationally, began to run like a dynamo. It is
difficult to explain my mood, but I seemed to be two persons--one
a reasonable modern man trying to keep sane and scornfully
rejecting the fancies which the other, a cast-back to something
elemental, was furiously spinning. But it was the second that had
the upper hand. . . . I felt myself loosed from my moorings, a
mere waif on uncharted seas. What is the German phrase?
<i>Urdummheit</i>--Primal Idiocy? That is what was the matter
with me. I had fallen out of civilisation into the Outlands and
was feeling their spell. . . . I could not think, but I could
remember, and what I had read of the Norse voyagers came back to
me with horrid persistence. They had known the outland
terrors--the Sea Walls at the world's end, the Curdled Ocean with
its strange beasts. Those men did not sail north as we did, in
steamers, with modern food and modern instruments, huddled into
crews and expeditions. They had gone out almost alone, in brittle
galleys, and they had known what we could never know.</p>

<p>"And then, I had a shattering revelation. I had been groping
for a word and I suddenly got it. It was Adam of Bremen's
<i>'proxima Abysso.'</i> This island was next door to the Abyss,
and the Abyss was that blanched world of the North which was the
negation of life.</p>

<p>"That unfortunate recollection was the last straw. I remember
that I forced myself to get up and try again to kindle a fire.
But the wood was still too damp, and I realised with
consternation that I had very few matches left, several boxes
having been ruined that morning. As I staggered about I saw the
flare which John had left for me, and had almost lit it. But some
dregs of manhood prevented me--I could not own defeat in that
babyish way--I must wait till John Ronaldson came for me next
morning. Instead I had another mouthful of brandy, and tried to
eat some of my sodden biscuits. But I could scarcely swallow;
this infernal cold, instead of rousing hunger, had given me only
a raging thirst.</p>

<p>"I forced myself to sit down again with my face to the land.
You see, every moment I was becoming more childish. I had the
notion--I cannot call it a thought--that down the avenue from the
North something terrible and strange might come. My nervous state
must have been pretty bad, for though I was cold and empty and
weary I was scarcely conscious of physical discomfort. My heart
was fluttering like a scared boy's; and all the time the other
part of me was standing aside and telling me not to be a damned
fool. . . . I think that if I had heard the rustle of a flock of
migrants I might have pulled myself together, but not a blessed
bird had come near me all day. I had fallen into a world that
killed life, a sort of Valley of the Shadow of Death.</p>

<p>"The brume spoiled the long northern twilight, and presently
it was almost dark. At first I thought that this was going to
help me, and I got hold of several of my half-dry rugs, and made
a sleeping-place. But I could not sleep, even if my teeth had
stopped chattering, for a new and perfectly idiotic idea
possessed me. It came from a recollection of John Ronaldson's
parting words. What had he said about the Black Silkie--the Finn
who came out of the deep and hunkered on this skerry? Raving
mania! But on this lost island in the darkening night, with icy
tides lapping about me, was any horror beyond belief?</p>

<p>"Still, the sheer idiocy of the idea compelled a reaction. I
took hold of my wits with both hands and cursed myself for a
fool. I could even reason about my folly. I knew what was wrong
with me. I was suffering from <i>panic</i>--a physical affection
produced by natural causes, explicable, though as yet not fully
explained. Two friends of mine had once been afflicted with it;
one in a lonely glen in the Jotunheim, so that he ran for ten
miles over stony hills till he found a saeter and human
companionship: the other in a Bavarian forest, where both he and
his guide tore for hours through the thicket till they dropped
like logs beside a highroad. This reflection enabled me to take a
pull on myself and to think a little ahead. If my troubles were
physical then there would be no shame in looking for the
speediest cure. Without further delay I must leave this
God-forgotten place.</p>

<p>"The flare was all right, for it had been set on the highest
point of the island, and John had covered it with a peat. With
one of my few remaining matches I lit the oily waste, and a great
smoky flame leapt to heaven.</p>

<p>"If the half-dark had been eery, this sudden brightness was
eerier. For a moment the glare gave me confidence, but as I
looked at the circle of moving water evilly lit up all my terrors
returned. . . . How long would it take John to reach me? They
would see it at once at Sgurravoe--they would be on the look-out
for it--John would not waste time, for he had tried to dissuade
me from coming--an hour--two hours at the most. . . .</p>

<p>"I found I could not take my eyes from the waters. They seemed
to flow from the north in a strong stream, black as the heart of
the elder ice, irresistible as fate, cruel as hell. There seemed
to be uncouth shapes swimming in them, which were more than the
flickering shadows from the flare. . . . Something portentous
might at any moment come down that river of death. . . . Someone.
. . .</p>

<p>"And then my knees gave under me and my heart shrank like a
pea, for I saw that the someone had come.</p>

<p>"He drew himself heavily out of the sea, wallowed for a
second, and then raised his head and, from a distance of five
yards, looked me blindly in the face. The flare was fast dying
down, but even so at that short range it cast a strong light, and
the eyes of the awful being seemed to be dazed by it. I saw a
great dark head like a bull's--an old face wrinkled as if in
pain--a gleam of enormous broken teeth--a dripping beard--all
formed on other lines than God has made mortal creatures. And on
the right of the throat was a huge scarlet gash. The thing seemed
to be moaning, and then from it came a sound--whether of anguish
or wrath I cannot tell--but it seemed to be the cry of a tortured
fiend.</p>

<p>"That was enough for me. I pitched forward in a swoon, hitting
my head on a stone, and in that condition three hours later John
Ronaldson found me.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"They put me to bed at Sgurravoe with hot earthenware bottles,
and the doctor from Voss next day patched up my head and gave me
a sleeping draught. He declared that there was little the matter
with me except shock from exposure, and promised to set me on my
feet in a week.</p>

<p>"For three days I was as miserable as a man could be, and did
my best to work myself into a fever. I had said not a word about
my experience, and left my rescuers to believe that my only
troubles were cold and hunger, and that I had lit the flare
because I had lost the boat. But during these days I was in a
critical state. I knew that there was nothing wrong with my body,
but I was gravely concerned about my mind.</p>

<p>"For this was my difficulty. If that awful thing was a mere
figment of my brain then I had better be certified at once as a
lunatic. No sane man could get into such a state as to see such
portents with the certainty with which I had seen that creature
come out of the night. If, on the other hand, the thing was a
real presence, then I had looked on something outside natural
law, and my intellectual world was broken in pieces. I was a
scientist, and a scientist cannot admit the supernatural. If with
my eyes I had beheld the monster in which Adam of Bremen
believed, which holy men had exorcised, which even the shrewd
Norlanders shuddered at as the Black Silkie, then I must burn my
books and revise my creed. I might take to poetry or theosophy,
but I would never be much good again at science.</p>

<p>"On the third afternoon I was trying to doze, and with shut
eyes fighting off the pictures which tormented my brain. John
Ronaldson and the farmer of Sgurravoe were talking at the kitchen
door. The latter asked some question, and John replied--</p>

<p>"'Aye, it was a wall-ross and nae mistake. It cam ashore at
Gloop Ness and Sandy Fraser hae gotten the skin of it. It was
deid when he found it, but no long deid. The puir beast would
drift south on some floe, and it was sair hurt, for Sandy said it
had a hole in its throat ye could put your nieve in. There hasna
been a wall-ross come to Una since my grandfather's day.'</p>

<p>"I turned my face to the wall and composed myself to sleep.
For now I knew that I was sane, and need not forswear
science."</p>

 And let not yet the swimmer leave<br>

<p> </p>

<p>One night we were discussing Souldern, who had died a week
before and whose memorial service had been held that morning in
St. Margaret's. He had come on amazingly in Parliament, one of
those sudden rises which were common in the immediate post-war
years, when the older reputations were being questioned and the
younger men were too busy making a livelihood to have time for
hobbies. His speeches, his membership of a commission where he
had shown both originality and courage, and his reputed refusal,
on very honourable grounds, of a place in the Cabinet, had given
him in the popular mind a flavour of mystery and distinction. The
papers had devoted a good deal of space to him, and there was a
general feeling that his death--the result of a motor smash--was
a bigger loss to the country than his actual achievement
warranted.</p>

<p>"I never met him," Palliser-Yeates said. "But I was at school
with his minor. You remember Reggie Souldern, Charles? An
uncommon good fellow--makings of a fine soldier, too--disappeared
with most of his battalion in March '18, and was never heard of
again. Body committed to the pleasant land of France but exact
spot unknown--rather like a burial at sea."</p>

<p>"I knew George Souldern well enough," said Lamancha, whom he
addressed. "I sat in the House with him for two years before the
War. That is to say, I knew as much of him as anybody did, but
there was very little you could lay hold of. He used to be a
fussy, ineffective chap, very fertile in ideas which he never
thought out, and always starting hares that he wouldn't hunt. But
just lately he seems to have had a call, and he looked as if he
might have a career. Rotten luck that a sharp corner and a lout
of a motor-cyclist should have put an end to it."</p>

<p>He turned to his neighbour. "Wasn't he a relation of yours,
Sir Arthur?"</p>

<p>The man addressed was the oldest member of the Club and by far
the most distinguished. Sir Arthur Warcliff had been a figure of
note when most of us were in our cradles. He began life in the
Sappers, and before he was thirty had been in command of a
troublesome little Somaliland expedition; then he had governed a
variety of places with such success that he was seriously spoken
of for India. In the War he would have liked to have returned
back to soldiering, but they used him as the Cabinet handy-man,
and he had all the worst diplomatic and administrative jobs to
tackle. You see, he was a master of detail and had to translate
the generalities of policy into action. He had never, as the
jargon goes, got his personality over the footlights, so he was
only a name to the public--but a tremendous name, of which every
party spoke respectfully. He had retired now, and lived alone
with his motherless boy. Usually, for all his sixty-five years,
he seemed a contemporary, for he was curiously young at heart,
but every now and then we looked at his wise, worn face, realised
what he had been and was, and sat at his feet.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said in reply to Lamancha. "George Souldern was my
wife's cousin, and I knew him well for the last twenty years.
Since the War I knew him better, and in the past eighteen months
I was, I think, his only intimate friend."</p>

<p>"Was he a really big man?" Sandy Arbuthnot asked. "I don't
take much stock in his profession--but I thought--just for a
moment--in that Irish row--that I got a glimpse of something
rather out of the ordinary."</p>

<p>"He had first-class brains."</p>

<p>Sandy laughed. "That doesn't get you very far," he said. The
phrase 'first-class brains' had acquired at the time a flavour of
comedy.</p>

<p>"No. It doesn't. If you had asked me the question six years
ago I should have said that George was a brilliant failure.
Immensely clever in his way, really well educated--which very few
of us are--laborious as a beaver, but futile. The hare that is
always being passed by every kind of tortoise. He had everything
in his favour, but nothing ever came out as he wanted it. I only
knew him after he came down from Oxford, but I believe that at
the University he was a nonpareil."</p>

<p>"I was up with him," said Peckwether, the historian. "Oh, yes,
he was a big enough figure there. He was head of Winchester, and
senior scholar of Balliol, and took two Firsts and several
University prizes in his stride. He must have sat up all night,
for he never appeared to work--you see, it was his pose to do
things easily--a variety of the Grand Manner. He was a most
disquieting undergraduate. In his political speeches he had the
air of having just left a Cabinet meeting."</p>

<p>"Was he popular?" someone asked.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Peckwether. "And for all his successes we
didn't believe in him. He was too worldly-wise--what we used to
call 'banausic'--too bent on getting on. We felt that he had all
his goods in the shop window, and that there was no margin to
him."</p>

<p>Sir Arthur smiled. "A young man's contemporaries are pretty
shrewd judges. When I met him first I felt the same thing. He
wasn't a prig, and he had a sense of humour, and he had plenty of
ordinary decent feeling. But he was the kind of man who could
never forget himself and throw his cap over the moon. One
couldn't warm to him. . . . But, unlike you, I thought he would
succeed. The one thing lacking was money, and within two years he
had remedied that. He married a rich wife; the lady died, but the
fortune remained. I believe it was an honest love match, and for
a long time he was heartbroken, and when he recovered he buried
himself in work. You would have said that something was bound to
happen. Young, rich, healthy, incredibly industrious, able,
presentable--you would have said that any constituency would have
welcomed him, that his party would have jumped at him, that he
would have been a prodigious success.</p>

<p>"But he wasn't. He made a bad candidate, and had to stand
three times before he got into the House. And there he made no
kind of impression, though he spoke conscientiously and always on
matters he knew about. He wrote a book on the meaning of colonial
nationalism--fluent, well expressed, sensible, even in parts
eloquent, but somehow it wasn't read. He was always making
speeches at public dinners and at the annual meetings of
different kinds of associations, but it didn't seem to signify
what he said, and he was scarcely reported. There was no
conspiracy of silence to keep him down, for people rather liked
him. He simply seemed to have no clear boundary lines and to be
imperfectly detached from the surrounding atmosphere. I could
never understand why."</p>

<p>"Lack of personality," said Lamancha. "I remember feeling
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what is personality? He had the things that make
it--brains and purpose. One liked him--was impressed by his
attainments, but, if you understand me, one wasn't impressed by
the man. . . . It wasn't ordinary lack of confidence, for on
occasion he could be aggressive. It was the lack of a continuity
of confidence--in himself and in other things. He didn't
<i>believe</i> enough. That was why, as you said, he was always
starting hares that he wouldn't hunt. Some excellent and
unanswerable reason would occur to him why he should slack off.
He was what I believe you call a good party man and always voted
orthodoxly, but, after four years in the House, instead of being
a leader he was rapidly becoming a mere cog in the machine. He
didn't seem to be able to make himself count.</p>

<p>"That was his position eight years ago, and it was not far
from a tragedy. He was as able as any man in the Cabinet, but he
lacked the d&aelig;monic force which even stupid people sometimes
possess. I can only describe him in paradoxes. He was at once
conceited and shy, inordinately ambitious and miserably conscious
that he never got the value of his abilities out of life. . . .
Then came the War."</p>

<p>"He served, didn't he?" Leithen asked. "I remember running
across him at G.H.Q."</p>

<p>"You may call it serving, if you mean that he was never out of
uniform for four years. But he didn't fight. I wanted him to. I
thought a line battalion might make a man of him, but he shrank
from the notion. It wasn't lack of courage--I satisfied myself of
that. But he hadn't the nerve to sink himself into the ranks of
ordinary men. You understand why? It would have meant the
realisation of what was the inmost fear of his heart. He had to
keep up the delusion that he was some sort of a swell--had to
have authority to buttress his tottering vanity.</p>

<p>"So he had a selection of footling staff jobs--<i>liaison</i>
with this and that, deputy-assistant to Tom, Dick and Harry,
quite futile, but able to command special passes and staff cars.
He ranked, I think, as a full colonel, but an Army Service Corps
private was more useful than ten of him. And he was as miserable
as a man could be. He liked people to think that his trouble was
the strain of the War, but the real strain was that there was no
strain. He knew that he simply didn't matter. At least he was
candid with himself, and he was sometimes candid with me. He
rather hoped, I think, that I would inspan him into something
worth doing, but in common honesty I couldn't, for you see I too
had come to disbelieve in him utterly.</p>

<p>"Well, that went on till March 1918, when his brother Reggie
was killed in the German push. Ninth Division, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Palliser-Yeates nodded. "Ninth. South African Brigade. He went
down at Marri&egrave;res Wood, but he and his lot stuck up the
enemy for the best part of a Sunday, and, I solemnly believe,
saved our whole front. They were at the critical point, you see,
the junction of Gough and Byng. His body was never found."</p>

<p>"I know," said Sir Arthur, "and that is just the point of my
story."</p>

<p>He stopped. "I suppose I'm right to tell you this. He left
instructions that if anything happened to him I was to have his
diary. He can't have meant me to keep it secret. . . . No, I
think he would have liked one or two people to know."</p>

<p>He looked towards Palliser-Yeates. "You knew Reggie Souldern?
How would you describe him?"</p>

<p>"The very best stamp of British regimental officer," was the
emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"Clever?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Only average brains, but every ounce of them
useful. Always cheery and competent, and a born leader of men. He
was due for a brigade when he fell, and if the War had lasted
another couple of years he might have had a corps. I never met
the other Souldern, but from what you say he must have been the
plumb opposite of Reggie."</p>

<p>"Just so. George had a great opinion of his brother--in
addition to the ordinary brotherly love, for there were only the
two of them. I thought the news of his death would break him
altogether. But it didn't. He took it with extraordinary calm,
and presently it looked as if he were actually more cheerful. . .
. You see, they never found the body. He never saw him lying
dead, or even the grave where he was buried, and he never met
anybody who had. Reggie had been translated mysteriously out of
the world, but the melancholy indisputable signs of death were
lacking."</p>

<p>"You mean he thought he was only missing and might turn up
some day?"</p>

<p>"No. He <i>knew</i> he was dead--the proof was too strong, the
presumption was too heavy. . . . But while there was enough to
convince his reason, there was too little for his imagination--no
white face and stiff body, no wooden cross in the cemetery. He
could <i>picture</i> him as still alive, and George had a queer
sensitive imagination about which most people knew nothing."</p>

<p>Sir Arthur looked round the table and saw that we were
puzzled.</p>

<p>"It is a little difficult to explain. . . . Do you remember a
story of the French at Verdun making an attack over ground they
had been fighting on for months? They shouted 'En avant, les
morts,' and they believed that the spirits of the dead responded
and redressed the balance. I think it was the last action at
Vaux. . . . I don't suppose the <i>poilu</i> thought the dead
came back to help him, but he pretended they were still
combatants, and got a moral support from the fancy. . . . That
was something like George Souldern's case. If you had asked him,
you would have found that he had no doubt that what was left of
Reggie was somewhere in the churned-up wilderness north of
P&eacute;ronne. And there was never any nonsense about
visitations or messages from the dead. . . . But the lack of
<i>visible</i> proofs enabled his imagination to picture Reggie
as still alive, and going from strength to strength. He nursed
the fancy till it became as real to him as anything in his
ordinary life. . . . Reggie was becoming a great man and would
soon be the most famous man in the world, and something of Reggie
went into him and he shared in Reggie's glory. In March '18 a
partnership began for George Souldern with his dead brother, and
the dead, who in his imagination was alive and triumphant, lifted
him out of the sticky furrow which he had been ploughing since he
left Oxford."</p>

<p>We were all silent except Pugh, who said that he had come
across the same thing in the East--some Rajput prince, I
think.</p>

<p>"How did you know this?" Lamancha asked.</p>

<p>"From the diary. George set down very fully every stage of his
new career. But I very nearly guessed the truth for myself. You
see, knowing him as I did, I had to admit a sudden and staggering
change."</p>

<p>"How soon?"</p>

<p>"The week after the news came. I had been in Paris, and on my
return ran across George in the Travellers' and said the ordinary
banal words of sympathy. He looked at me queerly, as he thanked
me, and if I had not known how deeply attached the brothers were,
I would have said that he was exhilarated by his loss. It was
almost as if he had been given a drug to strengthen his arteries.
He seemed to me suddenly a more substantial fellow, calmer, more
at peace with himself. He said an odd thing too. 'Old Reggie has
got his chance,' he said, and then, as if pulling himself up, 'I
mean, he had the chance he wanted.'</p>

<p>"In June it was clear that something had happened to George
Souldern. Do you remember how about that time a wave of dejection
passed over all the Allied countries? It was partly the mess in
Russia, partly in this country a slight loss of confidence in the
Government, which seemed to have got to loggerheads with the
soldiers, but mainly the 'drag' that comes in all wars. It was
the same in the American Civil War before Gettysburg. Foch was
marking time, but he was doing it by retreating pretty fast on
the Aisne. Well, our people needed a little cheering up, and our
politicians tried their hand at it. There was a debate in
Parliament, and far the best speech was George's. The rest were
mere platitude and rhetoric, but he came down on the point like a
steam-hammer."</p>

<p>"I know," said Lamancha. "I read it in the <i>Times</i> in a
field hospital in Palestine."</p>

<p>"In his old days nobody would have paid much attention. He
would have been clever and epigrammatic--sound enough, but
'precious.' His speech would have read well, if it had been
reported, but it wouldn't have mattered a penn'orth to anybody. .
. . Instead he said just the wise, simple, stalwart thing that
every honest man had at the back of his head, and he said it with
an air which made everybody sit up. For the first time in his
life he spoke as one having authority. The press reported him
nearly verbatim, for the journalists in the Gallery have a very
acute sense of popular values.</p>

<p>"The speech put George, as the phrase goes, on the political
map. The Prime Minister spoke to me about him, and there was some
talk of employing him on a mission which never materialised. I
met him one day in the street and congratulated him, and I
remember that I was struck by the new vigour in his personality.
He made me come home with him to tea, and to talk to him was like
breathing ozone. He asked me one or two questions about numbers,
and then he gave me his views on the War. At the time it was
fashionable to think that no decision would be reached till the
next summer, but George maintained that, if we played our cards
right, victory was a mathematical certainty before Christmas. He
showed a knowledge of the military situation which would have
done credit to any soldier, and he could express himself, which
few soldiers can do. His arguments stuck in my head, and I
believe I used them in the War Cabinet. I left with a very real
respect for one whom I had written off as a failure.</p>

<p>"Well, then came the last battle of the Marne, and Haig's
great advance, and all the drama and confusion of the autumn
months. I lost sight of George, for I was busy with the peace
overtures, and I don't think I even heard of him again till the
new year. . . . But the diary tells all about those months. I am
giving you the bones of the story, but I am going to burn the
diary, for it is too intimate for other eyes. . . . According to
it Reggie finished the War as a blazing hero. It was all worked
out in detail with maps and diagrams. He had become a corps
commander by August, and in October he was the chief fighting
figure on the British front, the conduit pipe of Foch's ideas,
for he could work out in practice what the great man saw as a
vision. It sounds crazy, but it was so convincingly done that I
had to rub my eyes and make myself remember that Reggie was lying
in a nameless grave on the Somme and not a household word in two
hemispheres. . . . George, too, shared in his glory, but just how
was not very clear. Anyway, the brothers were in the front of the
stage, Reggie the bigger man and George his civilian adviser and
opposite number. I can see now how he got his confidence. He was
no longer a struggler, but a made man; he had arrived, he was
proved, the world required him. Whatever he said or did must be
attended to, and, because he believed this, it was."</p>

<p>Lamancha whistled long and low. "But how could his mind work,
if he lived among fairy tales?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He didn't," said Sir Arthur. "He lived very much in the real
world. But he had all the time his private imaginative preserve,
into which his normal mind did not penetrate. He drew his
confidence from this preserve, and, having once got it, could
carry it also into the real world."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he intolerably conceited?" someone asked.</p>

<p>"No, for the great man was Reggie and he was only a satellite.
He was Reggie's prophet, and assured enough on that side, but
there was no personal arrogance. His dead brother had become, so
to speak, his familiar spirit, his <i>d&aelig;mon.</i> The fact
is that George was less of an egotist than he had ever been
before. His vanity was burned up in a passion of service.</p>

<p>"I saw him frequently during the first half of '19, and had
many talks with him. He had been returned to Parliament by a big
majority, but he wasn't much in the public eye. He didn't like
the way things were going, but at the same time as a good citizen
he declined to make things more difficult for the Government. The
diary gives his thoughts at that time. He considered that the
soldiers should have had the chief share in the settlement of the
world--Foch and Haig and Hindenburg--and Reggie. He held that
they would have made a cleaner and fairer job of it than the kind
of circus that appeared at Versailles. Perhaps he was right--I
can't be dogmatic, for I was a performer in the circus.</p>

<p>"That, of course, I didn't know till the other day. But the
change in George Souldern was soon manifest to the whole world.
There was the Irish business, when he went down to the worst
parts of the South and West, and seemed to be simply asking for a
bullet in his head. He was half Irish, you know. He wrote and
said quite frankly that he didn't care a straw whether Ireland
was inside or outside the British Empire, that the only thing
which mattered was that she should find a soul, and that she had
a long road to travel before she got one. He told her that at
present she was one vast perambulating humbug, and that till she
got a little discipline and sense of realities she would remain
on the level of Hayti. Why some gunman didn't have a shot at him
I can't imagine, except that such naked candour and courage was a
new thing and had to be respected. . . . Then there was the
Unemployment Commission. You remember the majority report--pious
generalities and futile compromises, George's dissenting report
made him for a month the best abused man in Britain, for he was
impartially contemptuous of all sides. To-day--well, I fancy most
of us would agree with George, and I observe that he is
frequently quoted by the Labour people.</p>

<p>"What struck me about his line of country was that it was like
that of a good soldier's. He had the same power of seeing simple
facts and of making simple syllogisms, which the clever
intellectual--such as George used to be--invariably misses. And
there was the soldier's fidelity and sense of service. George
plainly had no axe to grind. He had intellectual courage and
would back his views as a general backs his strategy, but he kept
always a curious personal modesty. I tell you it seemed nothing
short of a miracle to one who had known him in the old days.</p>

<p>"I accepted it as the act of God and didn't look for any
further explanation. I think that what first set me questioning
was his behaviour about Reggie's memorial. The family wanted a
stone put up in the churchyard of the family place in
Gloucestershire. George absolutely declined. He stuck his toes
into the ground and gave nothing but a flat refusal. One might
have thought that the brothers had been estranged, but it was
common knowledge that they had been like twins and had written to
each other every day.</p>

<p>"Then there was the business about a memoir of Reggie. The
regiment wanted one, and his Staff College contemporaries.
Tollett--you remember him, the man on the Third Army
Staff--volunteered to write it, of course with George's
assistance. George refused bluntly and said that he felt the
strongest distaste for the proposal. Tollett came to me about it,
and I had George to luncheon and thrashed it out with him. I
found his reasons very difficult to follow, for he objected even
to a regimental history being compiled. He admitted that Tollett
was as good a man as could be found for the job, but he said he
hated the idea. Nobody understood Reggie but himself. Someday, he
suggested, he might try to do justice to him in print--but not
yet. I put forward all the arguments I could think of, but George
was adamant.</p>

<p>"Walking home, I puzzled a good deal about the affair. It
couldn't be merely the jealousy of a writer who wanted to reserve
a good subject for himself--that wasn't George's character, and
he had no literary vanity. Besides, that wouldn't explain his
aversion to a prosaic regimental chronicle, and still less his
objection to the cenotaph in the Gloucestershire churchyard. I
wondered if there was not some quirk in George, some odd
obsession about his brother. For a moment I thought that he might
have been dabbling in spiritualism and have got some message from
Reggie, till I remembered that I had heard him a week before
declare his unbridled contempt for such mumbo-jumbo.</p>

<p>"I thought a good deal about it, and the guess I made was that
George was living a double life--that in his subconsciousness
Reggie was still alive for him. It was only a guess, but it was
fairly near the truth, and last year I had it from his own
lips.</p>

<p>"We were duck-shooting together on Croftsmoor, the big marsh
near his home. That had been Reggie's pet game; he used to be out
at all hours in the winter dawns and dusks stalking wildfowl.
George never cared for it, or indeed for any field sport. He
would take his place at a covert shoot or a grouse drive and was
useful enough with a gun, but he would have been the first to
disclaim the title of sportsman. But now he was as keen and
tireless as Reggie. He kept me out for eight hours in a filthy
day of rain wading in trench boots in Gloucestershire mud.</p>

<p>"We did fairly well, and just before sunset the weather
improved. The wind had gone into the north, and promised frost,
and as we sat on an old broken-backed stone bridge over one of
the dykes, waiting for the birds to be collected from the
different stands, the western sky was one broad band of palest
gold. We were both tired, and the sudden change from blustering
rain to a cold stillness, and from grey mist to colour and light,
had a strange effect upon my spirits. I felt peaceful and
solemnised. I lit a pipe, but let it go out, for my attention was
held by the shoreless ocean in the west, against which the scarp
of the Welsh hills showed in a dim silhouette. The sharp air, the
wild marsh scents, the faint odour of tobacco awoke in me a
thousand half-sad and half-sweet recollections.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it. I said something about Reggie.</p>

<p>"George was sitting on the bridge with his eyes fixed on the
sky. I thought he hadn't heard me, till suddenly he repeated
'Reggie. Yes, old Reggie.'</p>

<p>"'This was what he loved,' I said.</p>

<p>"'He still loves it,' was the answer, spoken very low. And
then he repeated--to himself as it were:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"'Fight on, fight on,' said Sir Andrew Barton.</i><br>
 <i>'Though I be wounded I am not slain.</i><br>
 <i>I'll lay me down and bleed awhile</i><br>
 <i>And then I'll rise and fight again.'"</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>"He turned his fine-drawn face to me.</p>

<p>"'You think Reggie is dead?'</p>

<p>"I didn't know what to say. 'Yes,' I stammered, 'I
suppose--'</p>

<p>"'What do you mean by death?' His voice was almost shrill. 'We
know nothing about it. What does it matter if the body is buried
in a shell-hole--?'</p>

<p>"He stopped suddenly, as a lamp goes out when you press the
switch. I had the impression that those queer shrill words came
not from George but from some other who had joined us.</p>

<p>"'I believe that the spirit is immortal,' I began.</p>

<p>"'The spirit--' again the shrill impersonal voice--'I tell you
the whole man lives. . . . He is nearer to me than he ever was .
. . we are never parted. . . .'</p>

<p>"Again the light went out. He seemed to gulp, and when he
spoke it was in his natural tones.</p>

<p>"'I apologise,' he said, 'I must seem to you to be talking
nonsense. . . . You don't understand. <i>You</i> would
understand, if anyone could, but I can't explain--yet--someday. .
. .'</p>

<p>"The head-keeper, the beaters and the dogs came out of the
reed beds, and at the same time the uncanny glow in the west was
shrouded with the film of the coming night. It was almost dark
when we turned to walk home, and I was glad of it, for neither of
us wished to look at the other's face.</p>

<p>"I felt at once embarrassed and enlightened. I had been given
a glimpse into the cloudy places of a man's soul, and had
surprised his secret. My guess had been right. In George's
subconscious mind Reggie was still alive--nay more, was
progressing in achievement as if he had never disappeared in the
March battle. It was no question of a disembodied spirit
establishing communication with the living--that was a business I
knew nothing about, nor George either. It was a question of life,
complete life, in a peculiar world, companionship in some
spiritual fourth dimension, and from that companionship he was
drawing sustenance. He had learned Reggie's forthrightness and
his happy simplicity. . . . I wondered and I trembled. There is a
story of an early Victorian statesman who in his leisure moments
played at being Emperor of Byzantium. The old Whig kept the two
things strictly separate--he was a pious humanitarian in his
English life, though he was a ruthless conqueror in the other.
But in George's case the two were mingling. He was going about
his daily duties with the power acquired from his secret world;
that secret world, in which, with Reggie, he had become a master,
was giving him a mastery over our common life. . . . I did not
believe it would last. It was against nature that a man could
continue to live as a parasite on the dead.</p>

<p>"I am almost at the end of my story. Two months later, George
became a figure of national importance. It was he who chiefly
broke up the Coalition at the Grafton House meeting, and thereby,
I suppose, saved his party. His speech, you remember, clove
through subtleties and irrelevances with the simple declaration
that he could not work with what he could not trust, and, unless
things changed, must go out of public life. That was Reggie's
manner, you know--pure Reggie. Then came the general election and
the new Government, and George, very much to people's surprise,
refused Cabinet office. The reason he gave was that on grounds of
principle he had taken a chief part in wrecking the late
Ministry, and he felt he could not allow himself to benefit
personally by his action. We all thought him high-minded, if
finical and quixotic, but the ordinary man liked it--it was a
welcome change from the old gang of <i>arrivistes.</i> But it was
not the real reason. I found that in the diary."</p>

<p>Sir Arthur stopped, and there was a silence while he seemed to
be fumbling for words.</p>

<p>"Here we are walking on the edge of great mysteries," he
continued. "The reason why he refused the Prime Minister's offer
was Reggie. . . . Somehow the vital force in that subconscious
world of his was ebbing. . . . I cannot explain how, but Reggie
was moving away from what we call realities and was beckoning him
to follow. . . . The Grafton House speech was George's last
public utterance. Few people saw him after that, for he rarely
attended the House. I saw him several times in Gloucestershire. .
. . Was he happy? Yes, I should say utterly happy, but too
detached, too peaceful, as if he had done with the cares of this
world. . . . I think I guessed what was happening, when he told
me that he had consented to the cenotaph in the churchyard. He
took a good deal of pains about it, too, and chose an
inscription, which his maiden aunts thought irreligious. It was
Virgil's <i>'Tendebant manus rip&aelig; ulterioris amore.' . .
.</i> He withdrew his objection to the memoir, too, and Tollett
got to work, but he gave him no help--it was as if he had lost
interest. . . . It is an odd thing to say, but I have been
waiting for the news which was in last week's paper."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that he engineered the motor smash?" Lamancha
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Sir Arthur gently. "As I said, we are treading
on the brink of great mysteries. Say that it was predestined,
fore-ordained, decreed by the Master of Assembly. . . . I know
that it had to be. If you join hands with the dead they will pull
you over the stream."</p>

<h1>THE LAST CRUSADE</h1>

<h1><i>FRANCIS MARTENDALE'S STORY</i></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is often impossible, in these political inquiries, to find
any proportion between the apparent force of any moral causes we
may assign, and their known operation. We are therefore obliged
to deliver up that operation to mere chance; or, more piously
(perhaps more rationally), to the occasional interposition and
the irresistible hand of the Great Disposer.</p>

<p>Burke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>One evening the talk at dinner turned on the Press. Lamancha
was of opinion that the performances of certain popular
newspapers in recent years had killed the old power of the
anonymous printed word. "They bluffed too high," he said, "and
they had their bluff called. All the Delphic oracle business has
gone from them. You haven't to-day what you used to have--papers
from which the ordinary man docilely imbibes all his views. There
may be one or two still, but not more."</p>

<p>Sandy Arbuthnot, who disliked journalism as much as he liked
journalists, agreed, but there was a good deal of difference of
opinion among the others. Pallister-Yeates thought that the Press
had more influence than ever, though it might not be much liked;
a man, he said, no longer felt the kind of loyalty towards his
newspaper that he felt towards his club and his special brand of
cigar, but he was mightily influenced by it all the same. He
might read it only for its news, but in the selection of news a
paper could wield an uncanny power.</p>

<p>Francis Martendale was the only journalist among us, and he
listened with half-closed sleepy eyes. He had been a war
correspondent as far back as the days of the South African War,
and since then had seen every serious row on the face of the
globe. In France he had risen to command a territorial battalion,
and that seemed to have satisfied his military interest, for
since 1919 he had turned his mind to business. He was part-owner
of several provincial papers, and was connected in some way with
the great Ladas news agency. He had several characters which he
kept rigidly separate. One was a philosopher, for he had
translated Henri Poincar&eacute;, and published an acute little
study of Bergson; another was a yachtsman, and he used to race
regularly in the twelve-metre class at Cowes. But these were his
relaxations, and five days in the week he spent in an office in
the Fleet Street neighbourhood. He was an enthusiast about his
hobbies and a cynic about his profession, a not uncommon mixture;
so we were surprised when he differed from Lamancha and Sandy and
agreed with Palliser-Yeates.</p>

<p>"No doubt the power of the leader-writer has waned," he said.
"A paper cannot set a Cabinet trembling because it doesn't like
its policy. But it can colour the public mind most damnably by a
steady drip of tendencious news."</p>

<p>"Lies?" Sandy asked.</p>

<p>"Not lies--truths judiciously selected--half-truths with no
context. Facts--facts all the time. In these days the Press is
obliged to stick to facts. But it can make facts into
<i>news,</i> which is a very different class of goods. And it can
interpret facts--don't forget that. It can report that Burminster
fell asleep at a public dinner--which he did--in such a way as to
make everybody think that he was drunk--which he wasn't."</p>

<p>"Rather a dirty game?" someone put in.</p>

<p>"Sometimes--often perhaps. But now and then it works out on
the side of the angels. Do any of you know Roper Willinck?"</p>

<p>There was a general confession of ignorance.</p>

<p>"Pity. He would scarcely fit in here, but he is rather a great
man and superbly good company. There was a little thing that
Willinck once did--or rather helped to do, with about a million
other people who hadn't a notion what was happening. That's the
fun of journalism. You light a match and fling it away, and the
fire goes smouldering round the globe, and ten thousand miles off
burns down a city. I'll tell you about it if you like, for it
rather proves my point."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It all began--said Martendale--with an old Wesleyan parson of
the name of Tubb, who lived at a place called Rhenosterspruit on
the east side of the Karroo. He had been a missionary, but the
place had grown from a small native reserve to an ordinary
up-country dorp; the natives were all Christians now, and he had
a congregation of store-keepers, and one or two English farmers,
and the landlady of the hotel, and the workmen from an adjacent
irrigation dam. Mr. Tubb was a man of over seventy, a devoted
pastor with a gift of revivalist eloquence, but not generally
considered very strong in the head. He was also a bachelor. He
had caught a chill and had been a week in bed, but he rose on the
Sunday morning to conduct service as usual.</p>

<p>Now about that time the Russian Government had been rather
distinguishing themselves. They had had a great function at
Easter, run by what they called the Living Church, which had
taken the shape of a blasphemous parody of the Christian rites
and a procession of howling dervishes who proclaimed that God was
dead and Heaven and Hell wound up. Also they had got hold of a
Patriarch, a most respected Patriarch, put him on trial for high
treason, and condemned him to death. They had postponed the
execution, partly by way of a refinement of cruelty, and partly,
I suppose, to see just how the world would react; but there
seemed not the slightest reason to doubt that they meant to have
the old man's blood. There was a great outcry, and the Archbishop
of Canterbury and the Pope had something to say, and various
Governments made official representations, but the Bolshies
didn't give a hoot. They felt that they needed to indulge in some
little bit of extra blackguardism just to show what stout fellows
they were.</p>

<p>Well, all this was in the cables from Riga and Warsaw and
Helsingfors, and it got into the weekly edition of the <i>Cape
Times.</i> There Mr. Tubb read it, as he lay sick in bed, and,
having nothing else to worry about, it fretted him terribly. He
could not bear to think of those obscene orgies in Moscow, and
the story of the Patriarch made him frantic. This, it seemed to
him, was a worse persecution than Nero's or Diocletian's, and the
Patriarch was a nobler figure than any martyr of the Roman
amphitheatre; and all the while the Christian peoples of the
world were doing nothing. So Mr. Tubb got out of bed on that
Sunday morning, and, having had no time to prepare a sermon,
delivered his soul from the pulpit about the Bolshies and their
doings. He said that what was needed was a new crusade, and he
called on every Christian man and woman to devote their prayers,
their money, and, if necessary, their blood to this supreme
cause. Old as he was, he said, he would gladly set off for Moscow
that instant and die beside the Patriarch, and count his life
well lost in such a testimony of his faith.</p>

<p>I am sure that Mr. Tubb meant every word he said, but he had
an unsympathetic audience, who were not interested in Patriarchs;
and the hotel-lady slumbered, and the store-keepers fidgeted and
the girls giggled and whispered just as usual. There the matter
would have dropped, had not a young journalist from Cape Town
been spending his holidays at Rhenosterspruit and out of some
caprice been present at the service. He was an ambitious lad, and
next morning despatched to his paper a brightly written account
of Mr. Tubb's challenge. He wrote it with his tongue in his
cheek, and headed it, "Peter the Hermit at Rhenosterspruit" with,
as a sub-title, "The Last Crusade." His editor cut it savagely,
and left out all his satirical touches, so that it read rather
bald and crude. Still it got about a quarter of a column.</p>

<p>That week the Ladas representative at Cape Town was rather
short of material, and just to fill up his budget of outgoing
news put in a short message about Rhenosterspruit. It ran: "On
Sunday Tubb Wesleyan Minister Rhenosterspruit summoned
congregation in name Christianity release Patriarch and announced
intention personally lead crusade Moscow." That was the result of
the cutting of the bright young correspondent's article. What he
had meant as fantasy and farce was so summarised as to appear
naked fact. Ladas in London were none too well pleased with the
message. They did not issue it to the British Press, and they
cabled to their Cape Town people that, while they welcomed "human
interest" stories, they drew the line at that sort of thing. What
could it matter to the world what a Wesleyan parson in the Karroo
thought about Zinovieff? They wanted news, not nonsense.</p>

<p>Now behold the mysterious workings of the Comic Spirit. Ladas,
besides their general service to the Canadian Press, made special
services to several Canadian papers. One of these was called,
shall we say? the <i>Toronto Watchman.</i> The member of the
Ladas staff who had the compiling of the <i>Watchman</i> budget
was often hard-pressed, for he had to send news which was not
included in the general service. That week he was peculiarly up
against it, so he went through the files of the messages that had
come in lately and had not already been transmitted to Canada,
and in the Cape Town section he found the Rhenosterspruit yarn.
He seized on it joyfully, for he did not know of the disfavour
with which his chief had regarded it, and he dressed it up nicely
for Toronto. The <i>Watchman</i> he knew was a family paper, with
a strong religious connection, and this would be meat and drink
to it. So he made the story still more matter-of-fact. Mr. Tubb
had sounded a call to the Christian Church, and was himself on
the eve of setting out against Trotsky like David against
Goliath. He left the captions to the Toronto sub-editors, but of
his own initiative he mentioned John Knox. That, he reflected
comfortably, as he closed up and went off to play golf, would
fetch the Presbyterian-minded <i>Watchman.</i></p>

<p>It did. The Editor of the <i>Watchman,</i> who was an elder of
the Kirk and a Liberal Member of Parliament, had been getting
very anxious about the ongoings in Russia. He was not very clear
what a Patriarch was, but he remembered that various Anglican
ecclesiastics had wanted to affiliate the English and Greek
Churches, so he concluded that he was some kind of Protestant. He
had, like most people, an intense dislike of Moscow and its ways,
and he had been deeply shocked by the Easter sacrilege. So he
went large on the Ladas message. It was displayed on his chief
page, side by side with all the news he could collect about the
Patriarch, and he had no less than two leaders on the subject.
The first, which he wrote himself, was headed "The Weak Things of
the World and the Strong." He said that Mr. Tubb's clarion-call,
"the voice of a simple man of God echoing from the lonely veld,"
might yet prove a turning-point in history, and he quoted Burke
about a child and a girl at an inn changing the fate of nations.
It might--it should--arouse the conscience of the Christian
world, and inaugurate a new crusade, which would lift mankind out
of the rut of materialism and open its eyes to the eternal
verities. Christianity had been challenged by the miscreants in
Russia, and the challenge must be met. I don't think he had any
very clear idea what he meant, for he was strongly opposed to
anything that suggested war, but it was a fine chance for
"uplift" writing. The second leader was called "The Deeper
Obligations of Empire," and, with a side glance at Mr. Tubb,
declared that unless the British Empire was a spiritual and moral
unity it was not worth talking about.</p>

<p>The rest of the Canadian Press did not touch the subject. They
had not had the Rhenosterspruit message, and were not going to
lift it. But the <i>Watchman</i> had a big circulation, and Mr.
Tubb began to have a high, if strictly local, repute. Several
prominent clergymen preached sermons on him, and a weekly paper
printed a poem in which he was compared to St. Theresa and Joan
of Arc.</p>

<p>The thing would have been forgotten in a fortnight, if McGurks
had not chosen to take a hand. McGurks, as you probably know, is
the biggest newspaper property in the world directed by a single
hand. It owns outright well over a hundred papers, and has a
controlling interest in perhaps a thousand. Its tone is strictly
national, not to say chauvinistic; its young men in Europe at
that time were all hundred-per-cent. Americans, and returned to
the States a hundred and twenty per cent., to allow for the
difference in the exchange. McGurks does not love England, for it
began with strong Irish connections, and it has done good work in
pointing out to its immense public the predatory character of
British Imperialism and the atrocities that fill the shining
hours in India and Egypt. As a matter of fact, however, its
politics are not very serious. What it likes is a story that can
be told in thick black headlines, so that the stupidest of its
free-born readers, glancing in his shirt-sleeves at the first
page of his Sunday paper, can extract nourishment. Murders,
rapes, fires and drownings are its daily bread, and it fairly
revels in details--measurements and plans, names and addresses of
witnesses, and appalling half-tone blocks. Most unfairly it is
called sensational, for the stuff is as dull as a directory.</p>

<p>With regard to Russia, McGurks had steered a wavy course. It
had begun in 1917 by flaunting the banner of freedom, for it
disliked all monarchies on principle. In 1919 it wanted America
to recognise the Russian Government, and take hold of Russian
trade. But a series of rebuffs to its special correspondents
changed its view, and by 1922 it had made a speciality of
Bolshevik horrors. The year 1923 saw it again on the fence, from
which in six months it had tumbled off in a state of
anti-Bolshevik hysteria. It was out now to save God's country
from foreign microbes, and it ran a good special line of experts
who proved that what America needed was a <i>cordon sanitaire</i>
to protect her purity from a diseased world. At the time of which
I speak it had worked itself up into a fine religious enthusiasm,
and had pretty well captured the "hick" public. McGurks was first
and foremost a business proposition, and it had decided that
crime and piety were the horses to back. I should add that,
besides its papers, it ran a news agency, the P.U., which stood
for Press Union, but which was commonly and affectionately known
as Punk.</p>

<p>McGurks seized upon the story in the <i>Toronto Watchman</i>
as a gift from the gods, and its headlines were a joy for ever.
All over the States men read "Aged Saint Defies Demoniacs--Says
That In God's Name He Will Move Mountains"--"Vengeance From The
Veld"--"The First Trumpet Blast"--"Who Is On The Lord's
Side--WHO?" I daresay that in the East and beyond the Rockies
people were only mildly interested, but in the Middle West and in
the South the thing caught like measles. McGurks did not leave
its stunts to perish of inanition. As soon as it saw that the
public was intrigued it started out to organise that interest. It
circularised every parson over big areas, it arranged meetings of
protest and sympathy, it opened subscription lists, and, though
it refrained from suggesting Government action, it made it clear
that it wanted to create such a popular feeling that the
Government would be bound to bestir itself. The home towns caught
fire, the Bible Belt was moved to its foundations, every
Methodist minister rallied to his co-religionist of
Rhenosterspruit, the Sunday Schools uplifted their voice, and
even the red-blooded he-men of the Rotary Clubs got going. The
Holiness Tabernacle of Sarcophagus, Neb., produced twenty
volunteers who were ready to join Mr. Tubb in Moscow, and the
women started knitting socks for them, just as they did in the
War. The First Consecration Church of Jumpersville, Tenn.,
followed suit, and McGurks made the most of the doings of every
chapel in every one-horse township. Punk, too, was busy, and
cabled wonderful stories of the new crusade up and down the
earth. Old-established papers did not as a rule take the Punk
service, so only a part of it was printed, but it all helped to
create an atmosphere.</p>

<p>Presently Concord had to take notice. This, as you know, is
the foremost American press agency--we call it the C.C.--and it
had no more dealings with Punk than the Jews with the Samaritans.
It was in close alliance with Ladas, so it cabled testily wanting
to know why it had not received the Rhenosterspruit message.
Ladas replied that they had considered the story too absurd to
waste tolls on, but, since the C.C. was now carrying a lot of
stuff about the new crusade, they felt obliged to cable to Cape
Town to clear things up. Punk had already got on to that job, and
was asking its correspondents for pictures of Rhenosterspruit,
interviews with the Reverend Tubb, details about what he wore and
ate and drank, news of his mother and his childhood, and his
premonitions of future greatness. Half a dozen anxious
journalists converged upon Rhenosterspruit.</p>

<p>But they were too late. For Mr. Tubb was dead--choked on a
chicken-bone at his last Sunday dinner. They were only in time to
attend the funeral in the little, dusty, sun-baked cemetery. Very
little was to be had from his congregation, which, as I have
said, had been mostly asleep during the famous sermon; but a
store-keeper remembered that the minister had not been quite like
himself on that occasion and that he had judged from his eyes
that he had still a bad cold. McGurks made a great fuss with this
scrap of news. The death of Mr. Tubb was featured like the demise
of a President or a film star, and there was a moving picture of
the old man, conscious that he was near his end (the chicken-bone
was never mentioned), summoning his failing strength to one
supreme appeal--"his eyes," said McGurks, "now wet with tears for
the world's sins, now shining with the reflected radiance of the
Better Country."</p>

<p>I fancy that the thing would have suddenly died away, for
there was a big prize-fight coming on, and there seemed to be a
risk of the acquittal of a nigger who had knifed a bootlegger in
Chicago, and an Anti-Kink Queen was on the point of engaging
herself to a Dentifrice King, and similar stirring public events
were in the offing. But the death of Mr. Tubb kept up the
excitement, for it brought in the big guns of the
Fundamentalists. It seemed to them that the old man had not died
but had been miraculously translated, just like Elijah or William
Jennings Bryan after the Dayton trial. It was a Sign, and they
were bound to consider what it signified.</p>

<p>This was much heavier metal than the faithful of Sarcophagus
and Jumpersville. The agitation was now of national importance;
it had attained "normalcy," as you might say, the "normalcy" of
the periodic American movement. Conventions were summoned and
addressed by divines whose names were known even in New York.
Senators and congressmen took a hand, and J. Constantine
Buttrick, the silver trumpet of Wisconsin, gave tongue, and was
heard by several million wireless outfits. Articles even appeared
about it in the intellectual weeklies. Congress wasn't in
session, which was fortunate, but Washington began to be uneasy,
for volunteers for the crusade were enrolling fast. The C.C. was
compelled to carry long despatches, and Ladas had to issue them
to the English Press, which usually printed them in obscure
corners with the names misspelt. England is always apathetic
about American news, and, besides, she had a big strike on her
hands at the time. Those of us who get American press-clippings
realised that quite a drive was starting to do something to make
Moscow respectful to religion, but we believed that it would be
dropped before any serious action could be taken. Meanwhile
Zinovieff and Trotsky carried on as usual, and we expected any
day to hear that the Patriarch had been shot and buried in the
prison yard.</p>

<p>Suddenly Fate sent Roper Willinck mooning round to my office.
I suppose Willinck is the least known of our great men, for you
fellows have never even heard his name. But he <i>is</i> a great
man in his queer way, and I believe his voice carries farther
than any living journalist's, though most people do not know who
is speaking. He doesn't write much in the Press here, only now
and then a paper in the heavy monthlies, but he is the prince of
special correspondents, and his "London Letters" in every known
tongue are printed from Auckland to Seattle. He seems to have
found the common denominator of style which is calculated to
interest the whole human family. On the Continent he is the only
English journalist whose name is known to the ordinary
reader--rather like Maximilian Harden before the War. In America
they reckon him a sort of Pope, and his stuff is syndicated in
all the country papers. His enthusiasms make a funny
hotch-potch--the League of Nations and the British Empire, racial
purism and a sentimental socialism; but he is a devout Catholic,
and Russia had become altogether too much for him. That was why I
thought he would be interested in McGurks' stunt, of which he had
scarcely heard; so he sat down in an armchair and, during the
consumption of five caporal cigarettes, studied my clippings.</p>

<p>I have never seen a man so roused. "I see light," he cried,
pushing his double glasses up on his forehead. "Martendale, this
is a revelation. Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. . . .
Master Ridley, Master Ridley, we shall this day kindle a fire
which will never be extinguished. . . ."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I said. "The thing will fizzle out in a solemn
protest from Washington to Moscow with which old Trotsky will
light his pipe. It has got into the hands of the highbrows, and
in a week will be clothed in the jargon of the State Department,
and the home towns will wonder what has been biting them."</p>

<p>"We must retrieve it," he said softly. "Get it back to the
village green and the prayer-meeting. It was the prayer-meeting,
remember, which brought America into the War."</p>

<p>"But how? McGurks has worked that beat to death."</p>

<p>"McGurks!" he cried contemptuously. "The time is past for
slobber, my son. What they want is the prophetic, the
apocalyptic, and by the bones of Habbakuk they shall have it. I
am going to solemnise the remotest parts of the great Republic,
and then," he smiled serenely, "I shall interpret that solemnity
to the world. First the fact and then the moral--that's the
lay-out."</p>

<p>He stuffed my clippings into his pocket and took himself off,
and there was that in his eye which foreboded trouble. Someone
was going to have to sit up when Willinck looked like that. My
hope was that it would be Moscow, but the time was getting
terribly short. Any day might bring the news that the Patriarch
had gone to his reward.</p>

<p>I heard nothing for several weeks, and then Punk suddenly
became active, and carried some extraordinary stuff. It was
mostly extracts from respectable papers in the Middle West and
the South, reports of meetings which seemed to have worked
themselves into hysteria, and rumours of secret gatherings of
young men which suggested the Klu-Klux-Klan. Moscow had a Press
agency of its own in London, and it began to worry Ladas for more
American news. Ladas in turn worried the C.C., but the C.C. was
reticent. There was a Movement, we were told, but the Government
had it well in hand, and we might disregard the scare-stuff Punk
was sending; everything that was important and reliable would be
in its own service. I thought I detected Willinck somewhere
behind the scenes, and tried to get hold of him, but learned that
he was out of town.</p>

<p>One afternoon, however, he dropped in, and I noticed that his
high-boned face was leaner than ever, but that his cavernous eyes
were happy. "'The good work goes cannily on,'" he said--he was
always quoting--and he flung at me a bundle of green
clippings.</p>

<p>They were articles of his own in the American Press, chiefly
the Sunday editions, and I noticed that he had selected the
really influential country papers--one in Tennessee, one in
Kentucky, and a batch from the Corn States.</p>

<p>I was staggered by the power of his stuff--Willinck had never
to my knowledge written like this before. He didn't rave about
Bolshevik crimes--people were sick of that--and he didn't bang
the religious drum or thump the harmonium. McGurks had already
done that to satiety. He quietly took it for granted that the
crusade had begun, and that plain men all over the earth, who
weren't looking for trouble, felt obliged to start out and
abolish an infamy or never sleep peacefully in their beds again.
He assumed that presently from all corners of the Christian world
there would be an invading army moving towards Moscow, a thing
that Governments could not check, a people's rising as
irresistible as the change of the seasons. Assuming this, he told
them just exactly what they would see.</p>

<p>I can't do justice to Willinck by merely describing these
articles; I ought to have them here to read to you. Noble English
they were, and as simple as the Psalms. . . . He pictured the
constitution of the army, every kind of tongue and dialect and
class, with the same kind of discipline as Cromwell's New
Model--Ironsides every one of them, rational, moderate-minded
fanatics, the most dangerous kind. It was like <i>Paradise
Lost</i>--Michael going out against Belial. . . . And then the
description of Russia--a wide grey world, all pale colours and
watery lights, broken villages, tattered little towns ruled by a
few miscreants with rifles, railway tracks red with rust, ruinous
great palaces plastered over with obscene posters, starving
hopeless people, children with old vicious faces. . . . God knows
where he got the stuff from--mainly his <i>macabre</i>
imagination, but I daresay there was a lot of truth in the
details, for he had his own ways of acquiring knowledge.</p>

<p>But the end was the masterpiece. He said that the true rulers
were not those whose names appeared in the papers, but one or two
secret madmen who sat behind the screen and spun their bloody
webs. He described the crusaders breaking through shell after
shell, like one of those Chinese boxes which you open only to
find another inside till you end with a thing like a pea. There
were layers of Jew officials and Lett mercenaries and
camouflaging journalists, and always as you went deeper the thing
became more inhuman and the air more fetid. At the end you had
the demented Mongol--that was a good touch for the Middle
West--the incarnation of the back-world of the Orient. Willinck
only hinted at this ultimate camarilla, but his hints were
gruesome. To one of them he gave the name of Uriel--a kind of
worm-eaten archangel of the Pit, but the worst he called Glubet.
He must have got the word out of a passage in Catullus which is
not read in schools, and he made a shuddering thing of it--the
rancid toad-man, living among half-lights and blood, adroit and
sleepless as sin, but cracking now and then into idiot
laughter.</p>

<p>You may imagine how this took hold of the Bible Belt. I never
made out what exactly happened, but I have no doubt that there
were the rudiments of one of those mass movements, before which
Governments and newspapers, combines and Press agencies, Wall
Street and Lombard Street and common prudence are helpless. You
could see it in the messages C.C. sent and its agitated service
cables to its people. The Moscow Agency sat on our doorstep and
bleated for more news, and all the while Punk was ladling out
firewater to every paper that would take it.</p>

<p>"So much for the facts," Willinck said calmly. "Now I proceed
to point the moral in the proper quarters!"</p>

<p>If he was good at kindling a fire he was better at explaining
just how hot it was and how fast it would spread. I have told you
that he was about the only English journalist with a Continental
reputation. Well, he proceeded to exploit that reputation in
selected papers which he knew would cross the Russian frontier.
He was busy in the Finnish and Latvian and Lithuanian Press, he
appeared in the chief Polish daily, and in Germany his stuff was
printed in one big Berlin paper and--curiously enough--in the
whole financial chain. Willinck knew just how and where to
strike. The line he took was very simple. He quietly explained
what was happening in America and the British Dominions--that the
outraged conscience of Christendom had awakened among simple
folk, and that nothing on earth could hold it. It was a Puritan
crusade, the most deadly kind. From every corner of the globe
believers were about to assemble, ready to sacrifice themselves
to root out an infamy. This was none of your Denikins and
Koltchaks and Czarist <i>emigr&eacute;</i> affairs; it was the
world's Christian democracy, and a business democracy. No
flag-waving or shouting, just a cold steady determination to get
the job done, with ample money and men and an utter carelessness
of what they spent on both. Cautious Governments might try to
obstruct, but the people would compel them to toe the line. It
was a militant League of Nations, with the Bible in one hand and
the latest brand of munition in the other.</p>

<p>We had a feverish time at Ladas in those days. The British
Press was too much occupied with the strike to pay full
attention, but the Press of every other country was on its hind
legs. Presently things began to happen. The extracts from
<i>Pravda</i> and <i>Izvestia,</i> which we got from Riga and
Warsaw, became every day more like the howling of epileptic
wolves. Then came the news that Moscow had ordered a very
substantial addition to the Red Army. I telephoned this item to
Willinck, and he came round to see me.</p>

<p>"The wind is rising," he said. "The fear of the Lord is
descending on the tribes, and that we know is the beginning of
wisdom."</p>

<p>I observed that Moscow had certainly got the wind up, but that
I didn't see why. "You don't mean to say that you have got them
to believe in your precious crusade."</p>

<p>He nodded cheerfully. "Why not? My dear Martendale, you
haven't studied the mentality of these gentry as I have. Do you
realise that the favourite reading of the Russian peasant used to
be Milton? Before the War you could buy a translation of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> at every book kiosk in every country fair.
These rootless intellectuals have cast off all they could, but at
the back of their heads the peasant superstition remains. They
are afraid in their bones of a spirit that they think is in
Puritanism. That's why this American business worries them so.
They think they are a match for Rome, and they wouldn't have
minded if the racket had been started by the Knights of Columbus
or that kind of show. But they think it comes from the
meeting-house, and that scares them cold."</p>

<p>"Hang it all," I said, "they must know the soft thing modern
Puritanism is--all slushy hymns and inspirational
advertising."</p>

<p>"Happily they don't. And I'm not sure that their ignorance is
not wiser than your knowledge, my emancipated friend. I'm
inclined to think that something may yet come out of the Bible
Christian that will surprise the world. . . . But not this time.
I fancy the trick has been done. You might let me know as soon as
you hear anything." And he moved off, whistling contentedly
through his teeth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He was right. Three days later we got the news from Warsaw,
and the Moscow Agency confirmed it. The Patriarch had been
released and sent across the frontier, and was now being coddled
and f&ecirc;ted in Poland. I rang up Willinck, and listened to
his modest <i>Nunc dimittis</i> over the telephone.</p>

<p>He said he was going to take a holiday and go into the country
to sleep. He pointed out for my edification that the weak things
of the world--meaning himself--could still confound the strong,
and he advised me to reconsider the foundations of my creed in
the light of this surprising miracle.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Well, that is my story. We heard no more of the crusade in
America, except that the Fundamentalists seemed to have got a
second wind from it and started a large-scale heresy hunt.
Several English bishops said that the release of the Patriarch
was an answer to prayer; our Press pointed out how civilisation,
if it spoke with one voice, would be listened to even in Russia;
and Labour papers took occasion to enlarge on the fundamental
reasonableness and urbanity of the Moscow Government.</p>

<p>Personally I think that Willinck drew the right moral. But the
main credit really belonged to something a great deal weaker than
he--the aged Tubb, now sleeping under a painted cast-iron
gravestone among the dust-devils and meerkats of
Rhenosterspruit.</p>

<h1><i>MARTIN PECKWETHER'S STORY</i></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between the Windrush and the Colne<br>
 I found a little house of stone--<br>
 A little wicked house of stone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Peckwether, the historian, whose turn for story-telling came
at our last dinner before the summer interregnum, apologised for
reading his narrative. He was not good, he said, at impromptu
composition. He also congratulated himself on Leithen's absence.
"He comes into the story, and I should feel rather embarrassed
talking about him to his face. But he has read my manuscripts and
approved it, so you have two reliable witnesses to a queerish
tale."</p>

<p>In his precise academic voice he read what follows.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The October day was brightening towards late afternoon when
Leithen and I climbed the hill above the stream and came in sight
of the house. All morning a haze with the sheen of pearl in it
had lain on the folds of downland, and the vision of far
horizons, which is the glory of Cotswold, had been veiled, so
that every valley seemed a place enclosed and set apart. But now
a glow had come into the air, and for a little the autumn lawns
had the tints of summer. The gold of sunshine was warm on the
grasses, and only the riot of colour in the berry-laden edges of
the fields and the slender woodlands told of the failing
year.</p>

<p>We were looking into a green cup of the hills, and it was all
a garden. A little place, bounded by slopes that defined its
graciousness with no hint of barrier, so that a dweller there,
though his view was but half a mile on any side, would yet have
the sense of dwelling on uplands and commanding the world. Round
the top edge ran an old wall of stones, beyond which the October
bracken flamed to the skyline. Inside were folds of ancient
pasture with here and there a thorn-bush, falling to rose
gardens, and, on one side, to the smooth sward of a terrace above
a tiny lake. At the heart of it stood the house, like a jewel
well set. It was a miniature, but by the hand of a master. The
style was late seventeenth-century, when an agreeable classic
convention had opened up to sunlight and comfort the dark
magnificence of the Tudor fashion. The place had the spacious air
of a great mansion, and was finished in every detail with a fine
scrupulousness. Only when the eye measured its proportions with
the woods and the hillside did the mind perceive that it was a
small dwelling. The stone of Cotswold takes curiously the colour
of the weather. Under thunder-clouds it will be as dark as
basalt; on a grey day it is grey like lava; but in sunshine it
absorbs the sun. At the moment the little house was pale gold,
like honey.</p>

<p>Leithen swung a long leg across the stile.</p>

<p>"Pretty good, isn't it?" he said. "It's pure authentic Sir
Christopher Wren. The name is worthy of it, too. It is called
Fullcircle."</p>

<p>He told me its story. It had been built after the Restoration
by the Carteron family, whose wide domains ran into these hills.
The Lord Carteron of the day was a friend of the Merry Monarch,
but it was not as a sanctuary for orgies that he built the house.
Perhaps he was tired of the gloomy splendour of Minster Carteron,
and wanted a home of his own and not of his ancestors' choosing.
He had an elegant taste in letters, as we can learn from his neat
imitations of Martial, his pretty <i>Bucolics,</i> and the more
than respectable Latin hexameters of his <i>Ars Vivendi.</i>
Being a great nobleman, he had the best skill of the day to
construct his hermitage, and here he would retire for months at a
time with like-minded friends to a world of books and gardens. He
seems to have had no ill-wishers; contemporary memoirs speak of
him charitably, and Dryden spared him four lines of encomium. "A
selfish old dog," Leithen called him. "He had the good sense to
eschew politics and enjoy life. His soul is in that little house.
He only did one rash thing in his career--he anticipated the
King, his master, by some years in turning Papist."</p>

<p>I asked about its later history.</p>

<p>"After his death it passed to a younger branch of the
Carterons. It left them in the eighteenth century, and the
Applebys got it. They were a jovial lot of hunting squires, and
let the library go to the dogs. Old Colonel Appleby was still
alive when I came to Borrowby. Something went wrong in his inside
when he was nearly seventy, and the doctors knocked him off
liquor. Not that he drank too much, though he did himself well.
That finished the poor old boy. He told me that it revealed to
him the amazing truth that during a long and, as he hoped,
publicly useful life he had never been quite sober. He was a good
fellow, and I missed him when he died. . . . The place went to a
remote cousin called Giffen."</p>

<p>Leithen's eyes, as they scanned the prospect, seemed
amused.</p>

<p>"Julian and Ursula Giffen. . . . I daresay you know the names.
They always hunt in couples, and write books about sociology and
advanced ethics and psychics--books called either 'The New This
or That,' or 'Towards Something or Other.' You know the sort of
thing. They're deep in all the pseudo-sciences. . . . Decent
souls, but you can guess the type. I came across them in a case I
had at the Old Bailey--defending a ruffian who was charged with
murder. I hadn't a doubt he deserved hanging on twenty counts,
but there wasn't enough evidence to convict him on this one.
Dodderidge was at his worst--it was just before they induced him
to retire--and his handling of the jury was a masterpiece of
misdirection. Of course there was a shindy. The thing was a
scandal, and it stirred up all the humanitarians, till the
murderer was almost forgotten in the iniquities of old
Dodderidge. You must remember the case. It filled the papers for
weeks. Well, it was in that connection that I fell in with the
Giffens. I got rather to like them, and I've been to see them at
their house in Hampstead. Golly, what a place! Not a chair fit to
sit down on, and colours that made you want to weep. I never met
people with heads so full of feathers."</p>

<p>I said something about that being an odd <i>milieu</i> for
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like human beings--all kinds. It's my profession to
study them, for without that the practice of the law would be a
lean affair. There are hordes of people like the Giffens--only
not so good, for they really have hearts of gold. They are the
rootless stuff in the world to-day--in revolt against everything
and everybody with any ancestry. A kind of innocent
self-righteousness--wanting to be the people with whom wisdom
begins and ends. They are mostly sensitive and tender-hearted,
but they wear themselves out in an eternal dissidence. Can't
build, you know, for they object to all tools, but very ready to
crab. They scorn any form of Christianity, but they'll walk miles
to patronise some wretched sect that has the merit of being
brand-new. 'Pioneers' they call themselves--funny little unclad
people adventuring into the cold desert with no maps. Giffen once
described himself and his friends to me as 'forward-looking,' but
that, of course, is just what they are not. To tackle the future
you must have a firm grip of the past, and for them the past is
only a pathological curiosity. They're up to their necks in the
mud of the present. . . . But good, after a fashion; and
innocent--sordidly innocent. Fate was in an ironical mood when
she saddled them with that wicked little house."</p>

<p>"Wicked" did not seem to me to be a fair word. It sat
honey-coloured among its gardens with the meekness of a dove. The
sound of a bicycle on the road behind made us turn round, and
Leithen advanced to meet a dismounting rider.</p>

<p>He was a tallish fellow, some forty years old perhaps, with
one of those fluffy blond beards that have never been shaved.
Short-sighted, of course, and wore glasses. Biscuit-coloured
knickerbockers and stockings clad his lean limbs.</p>

<p>Leithen introduced me. "We are walking to Borrowby, and
stopped to admire your house. Could we have just a glimpse
inside? I want Peckwether to see the staircase."</p>

<p>Mr. Giffen was very willing. "I've been over to Clyston to
send a telegram. We have some friends for the week-end who might
interest you. Won't you stay to tea?"</p>

<p>There was a gentle formal courtesy about him, and his voice
had the facile intonations of one who loves to talk. He led us
through a little gate, and along a shorn green walk among the
bracken to a postern which gave entrance to the garden. Here,
though it was October, there was still a bright show of roses,
and the jet of water from the leaden Cupid dripped noiselessly
among fallen petals. And then we stood before the doorway, above
which the old Carteron had inscribed a line of Horace.</p>

<p>I have never seen anything quite like the little hall. There
were two, indeed, separated by a staircase of a wood that looked
like olive. Both were paved with black and white marble, and the
inner was oval in shape, with a gallery supported on slender
walnut pillars. It was all in miniature, but it had a
spaciousness which no mere size could give. Also it seemed to be
permeated by the quintessence of sunlight. Its air was of
long-descended, confident, equable happiness.</p>

<p>There were voices on the terrace beyond the hall. Giffen led
us into a room on the left. "You remember the house in Colonel
Appleby's time, Leithen. This was the chapel. It had always been
the chapel. You see the change we have made. . . . I beg your
pardon, Mr. Peckwether. You're not by any chance a Roman
Catholic?"</p>

<p>The room had a white panelling, and on two sides deep windows.
At one end was a fine Italian shrine of marble, and the floor was
mosaic, blue and white, in a quaint Byzantine pattern. There was
the same air of sunny cheerfulness as in the rest of the house.
No mystery could find a lodgment here. It might have been a
chapel for three centuries, but the place was pagan. The Giffens'
changes were no sort of desecration. A green-baize table filled
most of the floor, surrounded by chairs like a committee room. On
new raw-wood shelves were files of papers and stacks of
blue-books and those desiccated works into which reformers of
society torture the English tongue. Two typewriters stood on a
side-table.</p>

<p>"It is our workroom," Giffen explained, "where we hold our
Sunday moots. Ursula thinks that a week-end is wasted unless it
produces some piece of real work. Often a quite valuable
committee has its beginning here. We try to make our home a
refuge for busy workers, where they need not idle but can work
under happy conditions."</p>

<p>"'A college situate in a clearer air,'" Leithen quoted. But
Giffen did not respond except with a smile; he had probably never
heard of Lord Falkland.</p>

<p>A woman entered the room, a woman who might have been pretty
if she had taken a little pains. Her reddish hair was drawn
tightly back and dressed in a hard knot, and her clothes were
horribly incongruous in a remote manor-house. She had bright
eager eyes, like a bird, and hands that fluttered nervously. She
greeted Leithen with warmth.</p>

<p>"We have settled down marvellously," she told him. "Julian and
I feel as if we had always lived here, and our life has arranged
itself so perfectly. My Mothers' Cottages in the village will
soon be ready, and the Club is to be opened next week. Julian and
I will carry on the classes ourselves for the first winter. Next
year we hope to have a really fine programme. . . . And then it
is so pleasant to be able to entertain one's friends. . . . Won't
you stay to tea? Dr. Swope is here, and Mary Elliston, and Mr.
Percy Blaker--you know, the Member of Parliament. Must you hurry
off? I'm so sorry. . . . What do you think of our workroom? It
was utterly terrible when we first came here--a sort of decayed
chapel, like a withered tuberose. We have let the air of heaven
into it."</p>

<p>I observed that I had never seen a house so full of space and
light.</p>

<p>"Ah, you notice that? It is a curiously happy place to live
in. Sometimes I'm almost afraid to feel so light-hearted. But we
look on ourselves as only trustees. It is a trust we have to
administer for the common good. You know, it's a house on which
you can lay your own impress. I can imagine places which dominate
the dwellers, but Fullcircle is plastic, and we can make it our
own just as much as if we had planned and built it. That's our
chief piece of good fortune."</p>

<p>We took our leave, for we had no desire for the company of Dr.
Swope and Mr. Percy Blaker. When we reached the highway we halted
and looked back on the little jewel. Shafts of the westering sun
now caught the stone and turned the honey to ripe gold. Thin
spires of amethyst smoke rose into the still air. I thought of
the well-meaning restless couple inside its walls, and somehow
they seemed out of the picture. They simply did not matter. The
house was the thing, for I had never met in inanimate stone such
an air of gentle masterfulness. It had a personality of its own,
clean-cut and secure, like a high-born old dame among the females
of profiteers. And Mrs. Giffen claimed to have given it her
impress!</p>

<p>That night in the library at Borrowby, Leithen discoursed of
the Restoration. Borrowby, of which, by the expenditure of much
care and a good deal of money, he had made a civilised dwelling,
is a Tudor manor of the Cotswold type, with high-pitched narrow
roofs and tall stone chimneys, rising sheer from the meadows with
something of the massiveness of a Border keep. He nodded towards
the linen-fold panelling and the great carven chimney-piece.</p>

<p>"In this kind of house you have the mystery of the elder
England. What was Raleigh's phrase? 'High thoughts and divine
contemplations.' The people who built this sort of thing lived
close to another world, and they thought bravely of death. It
doesn't matter who they were--Crusaders or Elizabethans or
Puritans--they had all poetry in them, and the heroic, and a
great unworldliness. They had marvellous spirits, and plenty of
joys and triumphs; but they had also their hours of black gloom.
Their lives were like our weather--storm and sun. One thing they
never feared--death. He walked too near them all their days to be
a bogy.</p>

<p>"But the Restoration was a sharp break. It brought paganism
into England--paganism and the art of life. No people have ever
known better the secret of a bland happiness. Look at Fullcircle.
There are no dark corners there. The man that built it knew all
there was to be known about how to live. . . . The trouble was
that they did not know how to die. That was the one shadow on the
glass. So they provided for it in the pagan way. They tried
magic. They never became true Catholics--they were always pagan
to the end, but they smuggled a priest into their lives. He was a
kind of insurance premium against unwelcome mystery."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was not till nearly two years later that I saw the Giffens
again. The May-fly season was near its close, and I had snatched
a day on a certain limpid Cotswold river. There was another man
on the same beat, fishing from the opposite bank, and I watched
him with some anxiety, for a duffer would have spoilt my day. To
my relief I recognised Giffen. With him it was easy to come to
terms, and presently the water was parcelled out between us.</p>

<p>We foregathered for luncheon, and I stood watching while he
neatly stalked, rose and landed a trout. I confessed to some
surprise--first that Giffen should be a fisherman at all, for it
was not in keeping with my old notion of him; and second, that he
should cast such a workman-like line. As we lunched together, I
observed several changes. He had shaved his fluffy beard, and his
face was notably less lean, and had the clear even sunburn of the
countryman. His clothes, too, were different. They also were
workman-like, and looked as if they belonged to him--no more the
uneasy knickerbockers of the Sunday golfer.</p>

<p>"I'm desperately keen," he told me. "You see it's only my
second May-fly season, and last year I was no better than a
beginner. I wish I had known long ago what good fun fishing was.
Isn't this a blessed place?" And he looked up through the canopy
of flowering chestnuts to the June sky.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've taken to sport," I said. "Even if you only
come here for the week-ends, sport lets you into the secrets of
the countryside."</p>

<p>"Oh, we don't go much to London now," was his answer. "We sold
our Hampstead house a year ago. I can't think how I ever could
stick that place. Ursula takes the same view. . . . I wouldn't
leave Oxfordshire just now for a thousand pounds. Do you smell
the hawthorn? Last week this meadow was scented like Paradise.
D'you know, Leithen's a queer fellow?"</p>

<p>I asked why.</p>

<p>"He once told me that this countryside in June made him sad.
He said it was too perfect a thing for fallen humanity. I call
that morbid. Do you see any sense in it?"</p>

<p>I knew what Leithen meant, but it would have taken too long to
explain.</p>

<p>"I feel warm and good and happy here," he went on. "I used to
talk about living close to nature. Rot! I didn't know what nature
meant. Now--" He broke off. "By Jove, there's a kingfisher. That
is only the second I've seen this year. They're getting uncommon
with us."</p>

<p>"With us"--I liked the phrase. He was becoming a true
countryman.</p>

<p>We had a good day--not extravagantly successful, but
satisfactory, and he persuaded me to come home with him to
Fullcircle for the night, explaining that I could catch an early
train next morning at the junction. So we extricated a little
two-seater from a thicket of lilacs, and he drove me through four
miles of sweet-scented dusk, with nightingales shouting in every
thicket. I changed into a suit of his flannels in a bedroom
looking out on the little lake where trout were rising, and I
remember that I whistled from pure light-heartedness. In that
adorable house one seemed to be still breathing the air of the
spring meadows.</p>

<p>Dinner was my first big surprise. It was admirable--plain but
perfectly cooked, and with that excellence of basic material
which is the glory of a well-appointed country house. There was
wine too, which, I am certain, was a new thing. Giffen gave me a
bottle of sound claret, and afterwards some more than decent
port. My second surprise was my hostess. Her clothes, like her
husband's, must have changed, for I did not notice what she was
wearing, and I had noticed it only too clearly the last time we
met. More remarkable still was the difference in her face. For
the first time I realised that she was a pretty woman. The
contours had softened and rounded, and there was a charming
well-being in her eyes very different from the old restlessness.
She looked content--infinitely content.</p>

<p>I asked about her Mothers' Cottages. She laughed
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I gave them up after the first year. They didn't mix well
with the village people. I'm quite ready to admit my mistake, and
it was the wrong kind of charity. The Londoners didn't like
it--felt lonesome and sighed for the fried-fish shop; and the
village women were shy of them--afraid of infectious complaints,
you know. Julian and I have decided that our business is to look
after our own people."</p>

<p>It may have been malicious, but I said something about the
wonderful scheme of village education.</p>

<p>"Another relic of Cockneyism," laughed the lady; but Giffen
looked a trifle shy.</p>

<p>"I gave it up because it didn't seem worth while. What is the
use of spoiling a perfectly wholesome scheme of life by
introducing unnecessary complications? Medicine is no good unless
a man is sick, and these people are not sick. Education is the
only cure for certain diseases the modern world has engendered,
but if you don't find the disease the remedy is superfluous. The
fact is, I hadn't the face to go on with the thing. I wanted to
be taught rather than to teach. There's a whole world round me of
which I know very little, and my first business is to get to
understand it. Any village poacher can teach me more of the
things that matter than I have to tell him."</p>

<p>"Besides, we have so much to do," his wife added. "There's the
house and the garden, and the home-farm and the property. It
isn't large, but it takes a lot of looking after."</p>

<p>The dining-room was long and low-ceilinged, and had a white
panelling in bold relief. Through the windows came odours of the
garden and a faint tinkle of water. The dusk was deepening, and
the engravings in their rosewood frames were dim, but sufficient
light remained to reveal the picture above the fire-place. It
showed a middle-aged man in the clothes of the later Carolines.
The plump tapering fingers of one hand held a book, the other was
hidden in the folds of a flowered waistcoat. The long, curled wig
framed a delicate face, with something of the grace of youth left
to it. There were quizzical lines about the mouth, and the eyes
smiled pleasantly yet very wisely. It was the face of a man I
should have liked to dine with. He must have been the best of
company.</p>

<p>Giffen answered my question.</p>

<p>"That's the Lord Carteron who built the house. No. No
relation. Our people were the Applebys, who came in 1753. We've
both fallen so deep in love with Fullcircle that we wanted to see
the man who conceived it. I had some trouble getting it. It came
out of the Minster Carteron sale, and I had to give a Jew dealer
twice what he paid for it. It's a jolly thing to live with."</p>

<p>It was indeed a curiously charming picture. I found my eyes
straying to it till the dusk obscured the features. It was the
face of one wholly at home in a suave world, learned in all the
urbanities. A good friend, I thought, the old lord must have
been, and a superlative companion. I could imagine neat Horatian
tags coming ripely from his lips. Not a strong face, but somehow
a dominating one. The portrait of the long-dead gentleman had
still the atmosphere of life. Giffen raised his glass of port to
him as we rose from the table, as if to salute a comrade.</p>

<p>We moved to the room across the hall, which had once been the
Giffens' workroom, the cradle of earnest committees and weighty
memoranda. This was my third surprise. Baize-covered table and
raw-wood shelves had disappeared. The place was now half
smoking-room, half library. On the walls hung a fine collection
of coloured sporting prints, and below them were ranged low
Hepplewhite bookcases. The lamplight glowed on the ivory walls,
and the room, like everything else in the house, was radiant.
Above the mantelpiece was a stag's head--a fair
eleven-pointer.</p>

<p>Giffen nodded proudly towards it. "I got that last year at
Machray. My first stag."</p>

<p>There was a little table with an array of magazines and weekly
papers. Some amusement must have been visible in my face as I
caught sight of various light-hearted sporting journals, for he
laughed apologetically. "You mustn't think that Ursula and I take
in that stuff for ourselves. It amuses our guests, you know."</p>

<p>I dared say it did, but I was convinced that the guests were
no longer Dr. Swope and Mr. Percy Blaker.</p>

<p>One of my many failings is that I can never enter a room
containing books without scanning the titles. Giffen's collection
won my hearty approval. There were the very few novelists I can
read myself--Miss Austen and Sir Walter and the admirable
Marryat; there was a shelf full of memoirs, and a good deal of
17th- and 18th-century poetry; there was a set of the classics in
fine editions, Bodonis and Baskervilles and suchlike; there was
much county history, and one or two valuable old herbals and
itineraries. I was certain that two years before Giffen would
have had no use for literature except some muddy Russian
oddments, and I am positive that he would not have known the name
of Surtees. Yet there stood the tall octavos recording the
unedifying careers of Mr. Jorrocks, Mr. Facey Romford, and Mr.
Soapy Sponge.</p>

<p>I was a little bewildered as I stretched my legs in a very
deep arm-chair. Suddenly I had a strong impression of looking on
at a play. My hosts seemed to be automata, moving docilely at the
orders of a masterful stage-manager, and yet with no sense of
bondage. And as I looked on they faded off the scene, and there
was only one personality--that house so serene and secure,
smiling at our modern antics, but weaving all the while an iron
spell round its lovers. For a second I felt an oppression as of
something to be resisted.</p>

<p>But no. There was no oppression. The house was too well-bred
and disdainful to seek to captivate. Only those who fell in love
with it could know its mastery, for all love exacts a price. It
was far more than a thing of stone and lime; it was a creed, an
art, a scheme of life--older than any Carteron, older than
England. Somewhere far back in time--in Rome, in Attica, or in an
&AElig;gean island--there must have been such places; but then
they called them temples, and gods dwelt in them.</p>

<p>I was roused by Giffen's voice discoursing of his books. "I've
been rubbing up my classics again," he was saying. "Queer thing,
but ever since I left Cambridge I have been out of the mood for
them. And I'm shockingly ill-read in English literature. I wish I
had more time for reading, for it means a lot to me."</p>

<p>"There is such an embarrassment of riches here," said his
wife. "The days are far too short for all there is to do. Even
when there is nobody staying in the house I find every hour
occupied. It's delicious to be busy over things one really cares
for."</p>

<p>"All the same I wish I could do more reading," said Giffen.
"I've never wanted to so much before."</p>

<p>"But you come in tired from shooting and sleep sound till
dinner," said the lady, laying an affectionate hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>They were happy people, and I like happiness. Self-absorbed
perhaps, but I prefer selfishness in the ordinary way of things.
We are most of us selfish dogs, and altruism makes us
uncomfortable. But I had somewhere in my mind a shade of
uneasiness, for I was the witness of a transformation too swift
and violent to be wholly natural. Years, no doubt, turn our eyes
inward and abate our heroics, but not a trifle of two or three.
Some agency had been at work here, some agency other and more
potent than the process of time. The thing fascinated and partly
frightened me. For the Giffens--though I scarcely dared to admit
it--had deteriorated. They were far pleasanter people. I liked
them infinitely better. I hoped to see them often again. I
detested the type they used to represent, and shunned it like the
plague. They were wise now, and mellow, and most agreeable human
beings. But some virtue had gone out of them. An uncomfortable
virtue, no doubt, but a virtue, something generous and
adventurous. Before their faces had had a sort of wistful
kindness. Now they had geniality--which is not the same
thing.</p>

<p>What was the agency of this miracle? It was all around me: the
ivory panelling, the olive-wood staircase, the lovely pillared
hall. I got up to go to bed with a kind of awe on me. As Mrs.
Giffen lit my candle, she saw my eyes wandering among the
gracious shadows.</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful," she said, "to have found a house which
fits us like a glove? No! Closer. Fits us as a bearskin fits the
bear. It has taken our impress like wax."</p>

<p>Somehow I didn't think that the impress had come from the
Giffens' side.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A November afternoon found Leithen and myself jogging
homewards from a run with the Heythrop. It had been a wretched
day. Twice we had found and lost, and then a deluge had set in
which scattered the field. I had taken a hearty toss into a
swamp, and got as wet as a man may be, but the steady downpour
soon reduced everyone to a like condition. When we turned towards
Borrowby the rain ceased, and an icy wind blew out of the east
which partially dried our sopping clothes. All the grace had
faded from the Cotswold valleys. The streams were brown torrents,
the meadows lagoons, the ridges bleak and grey, and a sky of
scurrying clouds cast leaden shadows. It was a matter of ten
miles to Borrowby: we had long ago emptied our flasks, and I
longed for something hot to take the chill out of my bones.</p>

<p>"Let's look in at Fullcircle," said Leithen, as we emerged on
the highroad from a muddy lane. "We'll make the Giffens give us
tea. You'll find changes there."</p>

<p>I asked what changes, but he only smiled and told me to wait
and see.</p>

<p>My mind was busy with surmises as we rode up the avenue. I
thought of drink or drugs, and promptly discarded the notion.
Fullcircle was above all things decorous and wholesome. Leithen
could not mean the change in the Giffens' ways which had so
impressed me a year before, for he and I had long ago discussed
that. I was still puzzling over his words when we found ourselves
in the inner hall, with the Giffens making a hospitable fuss over
us. The place was more delectable than ever. Outside was a dark
November day, yet the little house seemed to be transfused with
sunshine. I do not know by what art the old builders had planned
it, but the airy pilasters, the perfect lines of the ceiling, the
soft colouring of the wood seemed to lay open the house to a
clear sky. Logs burned brightly on the massive steel andirons,
and the scent and the fine blue smoke of them strengthened the
illusion of summer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Giffen would have had us change into dry things, but
Leithen pleaded a waiting dinner at Borrowby. The two of us stood
by the fireplace, drinking tea, the warmth drawing out a cloud of
vapour from our clothes to mingle with the wood-smoke. Giffen
lounged in an armchair, and his wife sat by the tea-table. I was
looking for the changes of which Leithen had spoken.</p>

<p>I did not find them in Giffen. He was much as I remembered him
on the June night when I had slept here, a trifle fuller in the
face perhaps, a little more placid about the mouth and eyes. He
looked a man completely content with life. His smile came readily
and his easy laugh. Was it my fancy, or had he acquired a look of
the picture in the dining-room? I nearly made an errand to go and
see it. It seemed to me that his mouth had now something of the
portrait's delicate complacence. Lely would have found him a fit
subject, though he might have boggled at his lean hands.</p>

<p>But his wife! Ah, there the changes were unmistakable. She was
comely now rather than pretty, and the contours of her face had
grown heavier. The eagerness had gone from her eyes and left only
comfort and good-humour. There was a suspicion, ever so slight,
of rouge and powder. She had a string of good pearls--the first
time I had seen her wear jewels. The hand that poured out the tea
was plump, shapely, and well cared for. I was looking at a most
satisfactory mistress of a country house, who would see that
nothing was lacking to the part.</p>

<p>She talked more and laughed oftener. Her voice had an airy
lightness which would have made the silliest prattle
charming.</p>

<p>"We are going to fill the house with young people and give a
ball at Christmas," she announced. "This hall is simply
clamouring to be danced in. You must come both of you. Promise
me. And, Mr. Leithen, it would be very nice if you brought a
party from Borrowby. Young men, please. We are overstocked with
girls in these parts. . . . We must do something to make the
country cheerful in winter-time."</p>

<p>I observed that no season could make Fullcircle other than
cheerful.</p>

<p>"How nice of you!" she cried. "To praise a house is to praise
the householders, for a dwelling is just what its inmates make
it. Borrowby is you, Mr. Leithen, and Fullcircle us."</p>

<p>"Shall we exchange?" Leithen asked.</p>

<p>She made a mouth. "Borrowby would crush me, but it suits a
Gothic survival like you. Do you think you would be happy
here?"</p>

<p>"Happy," said Leithen thoughtfully. "Happy? Yes, undoubtedly.
But it might be bad for my soul. . . . There's just time for a
pipe, Giffen, and then we must be off."</p>

<p>I was filling my pipe as we crossed the outer hall, and was
about to enter the smoking-room I so well remembered when Giffen
laid a hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"We don't smoke there now," he said hastily.</p>

<p>He opened the door and I looked in. . . . The place had
suffered its third metamorphosis. The marble shrine which I had
noticed on my first visit had been brought back, and the blue
mosaic pavement and the ivory walls were bare. At the eastern end
stood a little altar, with above it a copy of a Correggio
Madonna.</p>

<p>A faint smell of incense hung in the air and the fragrance of
hothouse flowers. It was a chapel, but, I swear, a more pagan
place than when it had been workroom or smoking-room.</p>

little house wore an air of gentle triumph.</p>
