  <p align="center"><b>The publisher  of the ensuing production, sends it into the world for the two following  reasons.</b></p>
  <p>First;  he hopes it may contribute a little to the relief of an old, infirm, and  friendless woman, to whom it is addressed.</p>
  <p>And  Secondly; he imagines, the account here given of a country so little known, may  be interesting to some, and amusing to all. With the original, which is now in  his hands, he declines taking any liberty, but leaves the unfortunate exile to  tell his story exactly in his own words, and how he acquits himself, the public  must determine.</p>
  <p>The  publisher has several letters from the same author still in his hands; and  should these meet with a favourable reception, they are intended to be  published, together with a life of the author on some future occasion.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b>LETTERS,  &amp;c.</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b>May 12 1793</b></h2>
  <p>Sydney-Cove,  Port-Jackson,<br>
    New-South-Wales, May 12th, 1793.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My  Ever Revered Aunt,</p>
  <p>Embracing  the opportunity of a returning vessel, I would waft you, from this place, a  second testimonial of my insuperable attachment and remembance. My first letter  per the Atlantic, I hope you have received before; but should it be otherwise,  after speaking to the present state of my mind, I shall hastily recapitulate  its principal contents.</p>
  <p>In  my saddest hours, and God knows there are many of them, I have observed you are  then most busy with my memory. Melancholy&rsquo;s sombre shadow louring over my soul,  endears the fleeting moment by impelling me to write to you. Indeed, it is  solely owing to this despondent state of mind, that ought I have produced for  those last four years proceeds. When this gloom frowns dreadful over the vista  of my being, I but too much indulge the dreary prospect&mdash;exploring the wide  domain of adversity terminated only by the impending darkness;&mdash;hence it is,  that whatever flows from my pen, or is laboured by my pencil, affects, in some  degree, the tone of mind that possess me at the period of its production.</p>
  <p>Recurring  now to my former letter:&mdash;it informed that I had wrote you from <i>Rio de Janeiro</i>; that I had escaped at  the <i>Cape of Good-Hope</i>, where I was betrayed  by the mercenary Dutch, and remanded to captivity; whence, after seven months  of imprisonment, the Royal Admiral E. Indiaman landed me here; where the  pur-blind jurisprudence of a <i>Scottish</i> tribunal, doubtless, first intended me.</p>
  <p>To  lead you through the labyrinth of all my sufferings, from the 28th of December,  1791, down to the present period, is a thing utterly impossible; neither is it  my duty to harrow up your feelings by the attempt.&mdash;It better becomes me to  soothe those sorrows that vague report in the public prints has most likely  excited, than to give an additional stab to so valued a life &mdash;a life I have  already, though innocently, almost extinguished.</p>
  <p>Yet  not to pass over all too rapid; and to shew how dear you were to me in my most  prosperous state, take the subsequent specimen intended for you, when I deemed  myself a favored denizen of heaven&mdash;breathing a few hours of inestimable  liberty.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>December 13  1791</b></h2>
  <p>Dated,  Cape of Good Hope,<br>
    African-Coast, Tuesday, Dec. 13th, 1791.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My  Dearest Aunt,</p>
  <p>Your  loved Watling is at liberty! to say ought else is almost unnecessary, as I am  conscious your amiable, tender heart, will now hope every thing. Indeed I am  very incapable to write more at present; nor will I ever be master of  sufficient language to give any semblance to these sensations I just now  experience. True, I am in a remote clime, where Slavery wields her iron  sceptre, and where slaves are at this moment attending me&mdash;yet blessed be Divine  Mercy, I enjoy freedom!&mdash;I that but yesterday had the ignominious epithet <i>convict</i> adhibited to my name, am again  myself! to-day all nature seems renovated. The sun that has ben clouded for  three years has regained his splendour, and the meads their verdure. &lsquo;Tis the  jubilee of creation; at least I will believe so.&mdash;I tread in air; my spirits are  electrified; and my poor heart beats quick with redoubled fervor and emotion  towards that peaceful little fire side which it has long sighed after and bled  for.</p>
  <p>I  hold it imprudent to commit to paper how I have obtained emancipation. I will  only say, that the ship Pitt lyes opposite my window, and means to sail by  Sunday next; after when, should any other vessel here tend to <i>Europe</i>, if possible, I will procure a  passage&mdash;and be happy.</p>
  <p>O  my poor, dear, dear aunt, rejoice with me! my senses are all absorbed in the  most pleasing delirium that ever was poured upon mortal. Most merciful good  God, design to pardon all that cavil and innate murmuring I have so frequently  emited against thy wise and just dispensations. Here upon my bended knee,  permit me to adore and render Thee the warmest gratulations for those  numberless blessings conferred upon an unworthy sinner&mdash;particularly this last,  most exquisitely felt&mdash;this sum-total of terrene felicity.</p>
  <p>Come  then my long drooping and forlorn Hope, and once more extend thy fairy  landscapes, and display thy tinselled forms. My glowing bosom can cheerfully  heighten even thy most vivid colouring, and indulge thy most flattering  phantoms. Best boon of indulgent heaven, never, never, never again fly thy  suppliant votary, but henceforth dwell unmolested in this unambitious, thrice  happy breast.</p>
  <p>So  soon as I have discharged this letter, I shall fabricate schemes for a continuation  of humble happiness. It is my wish, that we would together, with my dear and  faithful C&mdash;&mdash;, lead the residue of our days in obscurity, from the vices and  follies of this transitory faithless world;&mdash;and every dawning day, and setting  sun, offer up to the Father of Mercies, a sincere prayer for the most  distinguished of benefactions toward us his most favoured of creatures.</p>
  <p>May  that gracious Almighty, and every good angel protect you, and haste that happy  moment that restores us together&mdash;when the returning prodigal shall throw  himself at your feet&mdash;recount all his sorrows&mdash;and ever remain under the  influence of your indulgent eye, and tender monition.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  am<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear  Aunt, &amp;c.</p>
  <p>It  is needless to tell how soon the preceding became a most bitter contrast; but  the nauseous cup was poured out for me, and I was born to drink it to the very  dregs.&mdash;O dread Jehovah! wherefore didst thou so tenderly affix the giddy height  of fragile human felicity so directly over the tremendous abyss of blackest and  deepest of misery?&mdash;surely but to render me the most wretched and unhappy of all  mankind!</p>
  <p>Drop  but one single tear over this rueful feature of my existence, and if possible,&mdash;forget  it.</p>
  <p>I  may now say, that my constitution has after all this, had sufficient strength  to combat the repeated attacks of a smart fever; and I could also say much  more, but it being only of the same melancholy tenor, I shall for the time wave  egotism, and commence a slight, contour of this novel country:&mdash;not however  expecting connection, you must just accept of each wild idea as it presents  itself.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>December 13  1791<br>
    Continued: Account of the Colony</b></h2>
  <p>Britain,  I believe, still entertains, and very justly, an idea of the sterility and  miserable state of <i>N. S. Wales</i>. It  will be long before ever it can even support itself.&mdash;Still that country so  famed for charity and liberality of sentiment I doubt not will persevere to  continue it.&mdash;When I have seen so much wanton cruelty practised on board the <i>English</i> hulks, on poor wretches, without  the least colour of justice, what may I not reasonably infer?&mdash;<i>French</i> Bastile, nor <i>Spanish Inquisition</i>, could not centre more of horrors.</p>
  <p>Our  longest day coincides exactly with your shortest; and <i>vice versa</i>. The climate is an extremely sultry one, especially in  summer; and yet paradoxical as it may appear, it is in, no wise propitious for  tropical vegetation. A few European culinary vegetables grow, but never arrive  to their pristine maturity, and when re-transplanted dwindle unto nothing.&mdash; The  face of the country is deceitful; having every appearance of fertility; and yet  productive of no one article in itself fit for the support of mankind.</p>
  <p>The  flattering appearance of nature may be offered as the best apology for those  mistaken eulogisms lavished by a late eminent circumnavigator upon this place.  Perhaps nothing can surpass the circumambient windings, and romantic banks of a  narrow arm of the sea, that leads from this to <i>Parramatta</i>, another settlement about fourteen miles off. The Poet  may there descry numberless beauties; nor can there be fitter haunts for his imagination.  The elysian scenery of a Telemachus;&mdash;the secret recesses for a Thomson&rsquo;s  musidora;&mdash;arcadian shades, or classic bowers, present themselves at every  winding to the ravished eye.&mdash;Overhead the most grotesque foliage yields a  shade, where cooling zephyrs breathe every perfume. Mangrove avenues, and  picturesque rocks, entwined with nondescript flowers:&mdash;In short, were the  benefits in the least equal to the specious external, this country need hardly  give place to any other on earth.</p>
  <p>Often  amid these coveted solitudes do I wander by the silent moon, along the margin  of some nameless stream, and pray for the most loved of aunts, and for my  dearest C&mdash;&mdash;. The willing tear will often fall when I reflect upon your widowed  and impotent condition.&mdash;&ldquo;If in existence,&rdquo; I exclaim, &ldquo;alas! indigence and  pallid hunger most likely guards her humble door, whilst her modest heart pines  in silence, unknown to, and unacquainted with philantrophy. God of the widow  &amp; the orphan, shield her helpless head, and shed abroad comfort and pious  resignation in her agonized and solitary heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  worthy friend, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, may reasonably conclude, that these romantic scenes  will much amuse my pencil; though therein he is mistaken. The landscape painter  may in vain seek here for that beauty which arises from happy-opposed  off-scapes. Bold rising hills, of auzure distances would be a kind of  phaenomena. The principal traits of the country are extensive woods, spread  over a little-varied plain. I however confess, that were I to select and  combine, I might avoid that sameness, and find engaging employment. Trees  wreathing their old fantastic roots on high; dissimilar in tint and foliage;  cumbent, upright, fallen, or shattered by lightning, may be found at every  step; whilst sympathetic glooms of twilight glimmering groves, and wildest  nature lulled in sound repose, might much inspire the soul&mdash;all this I confess;  but all this, if I possibly can, shall be considered of hereafter.</p>
  <p>In  the warmer season, the thunder very frequently rolls tremendous, accompanied by  a scorching wind, so intolerable as almost to obstruct respiration;&mdash;whilst the  surrounding horizon looks one entire sheet of uninterrupted flame. The air,  notwithstanding, is in general dry. Fifteen months have been known to elapse  without a single shower; but though thus dry, the transitions of hot and cold  are often surprisingly quick and contrasted without any discernable injury to  the human system. I have felt one hour as intensely warm as if immediately  under the line, when the next has made me shiver with cold, yet have I not  experienced any harm therefrom; owing, without a doubt, to the dryness and  salubrity, of the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>The  vast number of green frogs, reptiles, and large insects, among the grass and on  the trees, during the spring, summer, and fall, make an incessant noise and  clamour. They cannot fail to surprise the stranger exceedingly, as he will hear  their discordant croaking just by, and sometimes all around him, though he is  unable to discover whence it proceeds:&mdash;nor can he perceive the animals from  whence the sounds in the trees issue, they being most effectually hid among the  leaves and branches. Should the curious Ornothologist, or the prying Botanist, emigrate  here, they could not fail of deriving ample gratification in their favorite  pursuits in this, luxuriant museum. Birds, flowers, shrubs, and plants; of  these, many are tinged with hues that must baffle the happiest efforts of the  pencil.&mdash;Quadrupeds are by no means various; but we have a variety of fishes,  the greater part of which, are dropped and spangled with gold and silver, and  stained with dyes transparent and bralliant as the arch of heaven.</p>
  <p>One  great error in many of our voyagers, is the giving pre-maturely a decided  opinion of what falls within the circle of their observation. That the  inhabitants of N. S. Wales, are centuries behind some other savage nations, in  point of useful knowledge, may be fact; but in this there is no criterion of  judging mental ability. Their huts and canoes, it is true, are extremely rude  and ill formed; but when we consider their non- acquaintance with iron tools,  and the hardness of their wood, it is more surprising that they can use it at  all.&mdash;It being so ponderous as to sink immediately in water, renders it entirely  useless that way:&mdash;consequently no succedaneum here can be so easily moulded, or  so fit for the purposes of forming their little vessels as the bark&mdash;and this,  both as builders and sailors they manage with singular dexterity.</p>
  <p>The  people are in general very straight and firm, but extremely ill featured; and  in my opinion the women more so than the men. Irascibility, ferocity, cunning,  treachery, revenge, filth, and immodesty, are strikingly their dark  characteristics&mdash;their virtues are so far from conspicuous, that I have not, as  yet, been able to discern them.</p>
  <p>One  thing I may adduce to their credit, that they are not cannibals. They burn and  bury their dead, but from what motive it is hard to conceive; immolation it  cannot be; as they have not apparently the smallest idea of a Deity, much less  of religion.</p>
  <p>In  imitation they are extremely apt, particularly in mimicry; and they seem also  in, many other respects to be capable of much improvement; but they are so very  unsteady and indolent, that it would be almost next to a miracle to bring them  to any degree of assiduity or perseverance.</p>
  <p>Here  I cannot help making what may appear rather an ill-natured remark; our  governors, for they are all such, have carried philosophy, I do not say  religion, to such a pitch of refinement as is surprising. Many of these savages  are allowed, what is termed, a freeman&rsquo;s ratio of provision for their idleness.  They are bedecked at times, with dress which they make away with the first  opportunity, preferring the originality of naked nature; and they are treated  with the most singular tenderness. This you will suppose not more than  laudable; but is there one spark of charity exhibited to poor wreches, who are  at least denominated christians? No, they are frequently denied the common  necessities of life! wrought to death under the oppressive heat of a burning  sun; or barbarously afflicted with often little merited arbitrary punishment&mdash;this  may be philosophy, according to the calculation of our rigid dictators; but I think  it is the falsest species of it I have ever known or heard of.</p>
  <p>The  men and women, at an early age, devote to their chieftain, the former, one of  the upper fore-teeth; and the latter, the first joint of the little finger of  the left hand, as a token of their fidelity.&mdash;This is one of their public  ceremonies, and is performed in the most bungling manner: but it is impossible  to descend to particulars in the limits of a narrow letter.</p>
  <p>A  canoe, spear, wooden sword, and shield, short buldgeon, stone hatchet, fishing  tackle, and a rude basket formed of bark, comprise the whole of their domestic  or offensive implements. Their substitute for knives is ever at hand; the first  shell that occurs fully answering that purpose.</p>
  <p>They  are very quick eyed, and dexterous in the striking of fish, or aiming of the  spear; but they are neither so athletic or nimble as might reasonably be  expected in a savage race.</p>
  <p>Bedaubing,  or streaking themselves in various forms with red or white earth, they would  prefer to the most tawdry birth-day suit whatever. The same want of taste keeps  them honest this way&mdash;but victuals, knives, or hatchets, vanish with them in a  twinkling.</p>
  <p>It  pays no small compliment to poesy and painting, that they are affected by the  most unenlightened as well as the most refined countries. The natives are  extremely fond of painting, and often sit hours by me when at work. Several  rocks round us have outre figures engraven in them; and some of their utensils  and weapons are curiously carved, considering the materials they have to work  with.</p>
  <p>Their  Poets neither having the advantage of writing or printing, are necessitated to  travel as the hedge-preachers in <i>Britain</i>,  to extend their reputation. It is but lately that an itinerant sable <i>Ossian</i> called this way, and held forth  to some hundreds of his countrymen, who after kindly entreating, escorted him  to some other bourne, to further promulgate his composition.</p>
  <p>Whatever  may be their merits in this department, I confess that I am not connoisseur  enough to guess at them. Of their music, however, I may aver that nothing can  be more disagreeable, unless it be their other favorite amusement, dancing; for  if harmony be the foundation of the one, and grace of the other, these  aborigines have not, as yet, the smallest idea of either.</p>
  <p>The  hair smeared with gum, and forked as the porcupine; a bone or straw stuck  horizontally through the middle cartilege of the nose; and the body streaked  over with red or white earth, completes the <i>ton</i> of dress of the inhabitants of <i>N. S.  Wales</i>, either for war, love, or festivity.</p>
  <p>Many  of them are tatowed over the arms, back, and breast, in a very irregular  manner, which seems to have been done at an early period of life, for which  they can assign no other reason than that of ornament.</p>
  <p>It  were presumption in me to speak of their language, with which I am but little  acquainted. Glossaries have been attempted by some of our pretending and  aspiring gentry, who, I am conscious, are as much ignorant of it as myself. I  think it is by no means copious, but rather confined to a few simple sounds;  but whether this is, or is not a beauty, I leave to the learned to determine.  To an <i>European</i> ear the articulation  seems uncommonly wild and barbarous; owing, very likely, to those national prejudices  every man imbibes, and perhaps cannot entirely divest himself of. One thing  they have in common with more refined communities, that marks a clannish  propinquity of kindred; which is a similarity in the termination of their  sir-names: Terribi-long, Benna-long, Bye-gong, Wyegong, Cole-bree, Nan-bree,  &amp;c., &amp;c., are full as striking as Thomson, Johnson, and Robson.</p>
  <p>As  it is impossible for me to be so particular as I could with the barbarian <i>New Hollander</i> must give place to a few  other remarks, I would inform you of ere I finish my letter.</p>
  <p>Returning  then back to general observations; and supposing you to have heard something of  the swiftness, meekness, and singular formation of the Kangaroo, of the  Opposum, Guanoe, Lizards, &amp;c., I may say, that not only these, but the  whole appearance of nature must be striking in the extreme to the adventurer,  and at first this will seem to him to be a country of enchantments. The  generality of the birds and the beasts sleeping by day, and singing or catering  in the night, is such an inversion in nature as is hitherto unknown.</p>
  <p>The  air, the sky, the land, are objects entirely different from all that a <i>Briton</i> has been accustomed to see  before. The sky clear and warm; in the summer very seldom overcast, or any haze  discernable in the azure; the rains, when we have them, falling in torrents,  &amp; the clouds immediately dispersing. Thunder, as said, in loud contending  peals, happening often daily, &amp; always within every two or three days, at  this season of the year. Eruscations and flashes of lightning, constantly succeeding  each other in quick and rapid succession. The land, an immense forest, extended  over a plain country, the maritime parts of which, are interspersed with rocks,  yet covered with venerable majestic trees, hoary with age, or torn with  tempests.&mdash;In a word, the easy, liberal mind, will be here filled with  astonishment, and find much entertainment from the various novel objects that  every where present themselves.</p>
  <p>To  sum up natural reflection for the present:&mdash;though there are a variety of  objects to exercise the imagination, yet such a sameness runs through the whole  of the animal and vegetable creation of New South Wales, that I think it would  be no hard matter for the discerning naturalist to at once distinguish them  from those of every other country, by their peculiarity. The various Banksias  do not more appear to belong to one common family, than the Kangaroo, Opposum,  and Kangaroo-rat, to that of the Kangaroo. The fruit and seed of the trees, and  most of the underwood, ligneous and scarce penetrable to the hardest instrument,  have all of them something of resemblance to each other. In short, from the  savage native in the animal, and the towering red gum in the vegetable,  everything indigenous to this colony, approaches or recedes by a very striking  and singular gradation of proximity.</p>
  <p><i>Sydney-Cove</i>, from whence I write this letter, is the principal settlement,  and is about 1/3 part as large as <i>Dumfries</i>. <i>Parramatta</i>, or <i>Rose-Hill</i>, that I have spoke of, is somewhat less; and the latest settlement,  called <i>Toongabbe</i>, about four miles  farther inland, is the least of all. Many houses of the two former settlements,  are built with brick, and covered with tiles; but none of them, the governor&rsquo;s  excepted, exceed the height of one story. His Excellency&rsquo;s, indeed, is composed  of the common and attic orders, with a pediment in front, and commands the most  exalted station, but as neither the wood, brick, nor stone (lime there is none)  are good for much, it is simple and without any other embellishment whatever.</p>
  <p>It  is impossible for a well-wisher to his country, not to breath a sigh, should he  visit us, nay, the genuine <i>British</i> patriot could scarce refrain from dropping a tear upon a survey of such  mistaken policy. To see what has been done in the space of five or six years,  of clearing, building, and planting, is astonishing. To behold hundreds of  hands laboriously misemployed, that might be of service, and not burthensome to  their country, assuredly deserves attention and reformation; for whatsoever interested  men may advance to the contrary, I humbly declare, that it is my opinion, that  all that has been done is of little service to our support, and of none at all  to government; and that neither this, nor the ensuing century will see us able  to subsist ourselves, much less to retaliate what has been lavished upon so  very wild an adventure.</p>
  <p><i>Norfolk</i>, is a small rocky island in the sea, and is governed  by a deputy, named King. It lyes in latitude 29&deg; . 3. south, longitude 168&deg; .  10. east. Its length does not exceed seven, nor its breadth four miles; and it  is about eight or ten days sail from <i>Sydney</i>.  Capital offences done in this island, are reserved to the decision of this  tribunal; where the culprits are brought to undergo a form of trial. I will not  say but justice in a criminal court may be administered impartially; but instances  of oppression, and mean souled despotism, are so glaring and frequent, as to  banish every hope of generosity and urbanity from such as I am:&mdash;for unless we  can flatter and cajole the vices and follies of superiors, with the most  abominable servility, nothing is to be expected&mdash;and even this conduct, very  often after all, meets with its just reward:&mdash;neglect and contempt.</p>
  <p>As  a late journalist is much anxious to insinuate the assiduity and virtue of  governor P&mdash;&mdash;, in urging matrimonial connections, and forbidding illicit ones, I  think I may here remark the efficacy of his endeavours. Had such a scheme taken  place, possibly something good might have accrued, though little I think could  reasonably have been expected from the coupling of <i>whore</i> and <i>rogue</i> together.  Be this as it may, I think that it would have been equally praise-worthy in his  Excellency, to have recommended to our betters, the setting us a continent  example; in lieu of which, there is scarce a man without his mistress. The high  class first exhibit it; and the low, to do them justice, faithfully copy it.</p>
  <p>I  have observed instances in the papers, of ladies of easy virtue, stoutly  withstanding the royal mercy, and bravely preferring death to <i>Botany-Bay</i>; but I would beg them to  permit me, who am also a prisoner, to encourage and advise them to behave more  pliant in future, and by so doing obtain their best wishes. Henceforth, be they  most forward in embracing every opportunity that occurs for transportation.  They may rest assured, that they will meet with every indulgence from the  humane officers and sailors in the passage; and after running the gauntlet there,  will, notwithstanding, be certain of coming upon immediate keeping at their  arrival. Nay more, if any girl of uncommon spirit, with a happy talent for  dissention, and no doubt but such there are, should attract the affection of  one in office, she may console herself with the comfortable prospect of  rendering every one unhappy around her; for by her duplicity and simulation,  she may so far agitate her cully, supposing him one of the springs of our  government, as to make our infant colony quake to the very centre.</p>
  <p>But  be she ever so dispicable in person or in manners, here she may depend that she  will dress and live better and easier than ever she did in the prior part of  her prostitution.</p>
  <p>Now  for a contrast.&mdash;If a man&rsquo;s abilities are good, they are his bane, and impede  his emancipation. He must abide upon the colony and become the property of some  haughty despot; or be lent about as an household utensil to his neighbours&mdash;there  to exert these abilities, without any other emoluments than illiberal  reflection; for the least apparent murmuring would instantaneously be construed  insolence, and could not fail, though he had faithfully served years, to  immediately damn him for ever in this life&mdash;for it would be burthened by  cruelty, hunger, and the most laborious of employment.</p>
  <p>Be  my merits what they may, I am sorry to say, that they have been pursued by a  good deal of this malign fortune I now mention; and for which I quote myself,  as one instance, to ascertain the truth of. My employment is painting for J. W&mdash;&mdash;,  esq., the non-descript productions of the country; and for which, I have the  rewards hinted at in the preceding sentence. The performances are, in  consequence, such as may be expected from genius in bondage, to a very  mercenary sordid person. There are, thank God, no fetters for the soul:  collected in herself, she scorns ungenerous treatment, or a prostitution of her  perfections; nor will she meanly pluck the laurel from her own brow, to deck  that of her unworthy governor. Let it suffice to <i>Britain</i>, that my youthful hopes and reputation are levelled in the  dust, and that my old age will be unhoused and indigent; but never let her  presume to barter to interested men, the efforts of the artist, or lowers of  the mind; for those are placed infinitely above her reach.</p>
  <p>I  could, along with this, point out many practices equally obnoxious to honor or  justice; but coming from my pen, they might savour so much of virulence, and so  little of candour, that I shall wave them. Though I have nothing to expect  from, or thank my natal abode for, still, fallen as I am, it would pain me to  have my veracity even doubted of by those I am unknown to.</p>
  <p>Should  all, or any of these observations, seem not quite original, they may still  prove entertaining from their simplicity and truth. If, therefore, the  publication of such a letter, after the revisal by an abler hand, can be in the  least conducive to the interest of my dear aunt, I shall yet account myself not  altogether cast away; and shall take care to furnish her with materials by  every opportunity. There however are reflections, which I need not point out,  that I could wish either entirely suppressed, or moulded into such a form, that  should they recoil here, they may not create me cruel and invincible enemies.  And if any person can be found, whose influence is so powerful as to extend  here, and soften my ill-fated condition, one or two years would return me back with  as correct an history, and as faithful and finished a set of drawings of the  picturesque, botanic, or animate curiosities of N. S. Wales, as has ever yet  been received in England.</p>
  <p>Possibly,  E. M&mdash;&mdash;, esq. No.&mdash;&mdash;, Ely, Place, <i>London;</i> J. M&mdash;&mdash;, esq.; J. B&mdash;&mdash;, esq. at the India-Board, Whitehall; J. St. B&mdash;&mdash;, esq., <i>London;</i> or Sir J. J&mdash;&mdash;, any of these,  either jointly or severally, might accomplish it.&mdash;I but submit this hint,  without the smallest expectation of ever profiting by it.</p>
  <p>To  make a proud comparison with a most celebrated literary character, in order to  soften the demerits of this heterogeneous and deranged performance, I may truly  say, that it was neither executed under the shelter of acadmic bowers, nor the  patronage of the great; but in much indigence, sickness, and indescribable  sorrow. That it was stolen from the nightly repose of a poor being, who could  but ill spare it, and who had to toil as a slave by day, and prohibited from  such an attempt under the terror of rigid punishment&mdash;and yet, who maugre every  barrier, accomplished the present, from no other motive than to inform his abilities  subservient to her necessities.</p>
  <p>Having  occupied so much of my paper, and perhaps to little purpose, it is high time to  turn to my aunt, and speak of my affection. Never did I find language so  imperfect as at present, nor letters to give so little satisfaction; for the  former cannot shadow my feelings, nor the latter yield me more than pensive  melancholy reflection. Yet blessed be my God, and you my dear, dear parent,  even for the power of writing. It can soothe, in come measure, the black  desponding hour, and escape me to hold an imaginary correspondence with you.&mdash;If  my present should reach <i>Dumfries</i>, and  find you in existence, I can figure to myself the little assembled groupe,  anxious for its perusal; and my dear aunt as principal, with the tear of  unceasing sorrow stealing down her pallid cheek. O God, here I would implore  thee to speedily terminate to us both, the bitter tempest of time; and grant to  two afflicted and weary wanderers, a happy meeting in the profound repose of  thy beatific eternity!</p>
  <p>I  find also, for every one of my friends, a regard strengthened in proportion to  my long, long absence. Heaven knows whether my weak heart could have stood equally  faithful in prosperity; but certain it is, the annals of adversity does not  inroll a name superior to that of poor Watling, for grateful fidelity to  generous well-wishers.</p>
  <p>To  two young women, who I doubt not will remember me, I would present both my love  and respect. I think Miss K. M&mdash;&mdash;, will not forget one who wishes her but barely  as fortunate as he is unhappy. Neither should Miss A. B&mdash;&mdash;, disfavor the  recollection of me, for a similar reason. Tender motives I will not urge, as  they might possibly offend; but a letter from either, especially Miss M&mdash;&mdash;,  would be an acquisition superior to worldly fortune. For these two young  people, my regard must be very superior to impure desire; as at this remote  distance, and with so little hope of future comfort, I nevertheless treasure  for them both the most tender, but most pure and virtuous of sentiments.</p>
  <p>My  old favourite Miss J. S&mdash;&mdash;, is also still a great one. Tell me whether or not  she is single: she used ever to be a kind neighbour; and one I could cheerfully  at any time in my better days, have taken as a lovely and awagreeable partner  through life.</p>
  <p>I  begged hard for a letter from Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, in my last one to you. I hope he will  indulge me with the state of himself, and amiable spouse, and family. Tell him,  it will be extremely painful, should I return without having where to lay my  head, if he should forget me.</p>
  <p>I  shall not enumerate all my friends; flattering myself they will not deem it  disrespectful. Woe-worn as I am, my memory is not that treacherous as to forget  favours though long since conferred; but having crowded myself to this last  page, I cannot do more than just repeat their revered names. Mr. and Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;,  B&mdash;&mdash;, D&mdash;&mdash;, and the pious Mrs. M. K&mdash;&mdash;; these are foremost in my memory; yet thank  God, I have still more that I do not specify, who occupy a warm corner in this  unfortunate heart.</p>
  <p>When  you write to me, be so kind as inform me of every little incident in the place;  for the most trivial will be entertaining and dear to me. I have seen almost  the whole of the <i>London</i> newspapers  down to the last six months; but as they do not descend to occurrences done in  that neighbourhood where my infant and happier years were passed, their intelligence  is flat and insipid. Your new bridge and theatre I have already heard of, from  a soldier who had wrought as a gardener with the M&mdash;&mdash;, and P. M&mdash;&mdash;, of D&mdash;&mdash;; and  who called upon me to see whether I could promote a little cause for him with  his commanding officer.</p>
  <p>Possibly,  if you can insert an advertisement in any public print, something to the  following purport, it may one day turn to advantage: as my sole motive is your  interest, and my happiness your well-being. I leave the scheme for you to  decide upon, and to act as the better judgment of yourself and friends shall  determine.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Address</b></h2>
  <p>Sydney-Cove,  Port Jackson,<br>
    New South Wales, May 20th, 1793.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas  Watling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal Limner In New South Wales,</p>
  <p>Extremely  anxious to deserve better of his Country, proposes, with due Deference, under  the Patronage of an impartial Public,</p>
  <p><i>The Execution of a
    Picturesque Description Of That Colony</i></p>
  <p><i>In an highly-finished Set of </i>Drawings, <i>done  faithfully upon the Spott, from Nature, in Mezzo,</i> Aqua-tinta,<i> or</i> Water Colours.</p>
  <p>That  the subjects attempted, shall be partial and general views of <i>Sydney</i>, <i>Parramatta</i>, and <i>Toongabbe</i>;  romantic groves, or native groupes, and that, if possible, in the course of the  work, curiosities in ornothology and botany shall be interwoven.</p>
  <p>Though  the fabricator, with deep confusion, confesses himself a prisoner, he would,  nevertheless flatter himself, that a philanthropic and liberal minded nation,  would not render that an insuperable barrier; nor from so melancholy a  circumstance, deny him any claim to merit. He would modestly insinuate, that he  rates his abilities equal to the task proposed; and flatters himself, that his  performances shall be the most accurate and elegant that have, as yet, been  received in <i>Britain</i>, from the new  world.</p>
  <p>Those  gentlemen inclined to encourage a work attempted by an unfortunate being, that  possibly may not be utterly destitute of genius, are humbly requested to  transmit their names (post paying) to Mrs. M. K&mdash;&mdash;, nigh &amp;c.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>No  emolument is expected until the paintings or drawings shall arrive in <i>Britain</i>, and be submitted to the subscribers  for engraving; when, should they be found worthy the indulgence and protection  of the really unbiassed friends of lowly distressed merit&mdash;The author, shall  gratefully thank his patrons for what they may think him deserving for his  labours.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>Try  to prevail with Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, to write a good letter, in my name, to capt. M&mdash;&mdash;, at E&mdash;&mdash;  P&mdash;&mdash;; stating, that my present condition is chiefly owing to the low revenge of  a certain military character, now high in office. I would also beg the  permission of dedicating this intended work to him, which I have already  privately commenced, and which I have every reason to hope will not be a  despicable one. Could he prevail with alderman M&rsquo;C&mdash;&mdash;, to intercede for me, if  not to be emancipated, at least to procure for me the indulgence of prosecuting  my plan, it would probably revive my almost extinguished emulation. Here again  I refer you to your better judgment.</p>
  <p>And  now being upon the close of my letter&mdash;a letter that I am much anxious for its  conveyance; I would earnestly implore, that should it fall into the hands of  strangers, they would generously forward it to the person for whom it is  addressed:&mdash;and that should it arrive in <i>Dumfries</i>,  and that tender being happily stolen from existence, that they would add to  this obligation a single line of information to the writer, his most fervent  prayers should be the retaliation.</p>
  <p>O!  my dear aunt, at the moment I write hastily these last lines, my poor heart  undergoes the most ominous pangs&mdash;Yet alas! why should it? since only in immortality  I now fix my anchor for peace and rest. The sooner we meet in that state, the  sooner it is to be hoped will these painful perturbations cease, and  retrospection and sorrow be wiped forever from your eyes.</p>
  <p>Pardon  me, best of parents, that this <i>il-pensoroso</i> gloom urges me to affect you.&mdash;What would I not give to stretch me but one half  hour upon my aged grandmother&rsquo;s grave? or what, to throw me at your revered  feet, or mingle with your dust? Pardon such ideas! Oh me! aunt, I am weak! hide  this paragraph, and impute it solely to the softening hand of ever dropping  sorrow.</p>
  <p>If there be a friend of mine that  can yet recollect me, I would thank him or her for a letter. No one commander  of a vessel will refuse its carriage, paying the inland postage, and directing  it to the care of E. L&mdash;&mdash;, esq., surgeon, at <i>Sydney</i>,  N. S. Wales I need not say that I bless you; and that I am sure of your  blessing in return; for if possible we are both of us more than sure of either.  Remember we will meet, if not in time, in eternity. Meanwhile accept this tear,  and heart-felt adieu, which is all at present that is in the power of your  unhappy but most affectionate nephew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T. Watling.</p>
