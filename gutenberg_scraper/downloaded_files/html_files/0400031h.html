<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was back in my sailor days, in the winter of my great
down-and-outness, that all this happened. In those years of
wandering, to be broke and "on the beach" in some seaport or
other of the world was no new experience; but this had been an
unusually long period of inaction even for me. Six months before
I had landed in New York after a voyage from Buenos Aires as able
seaman on a British tramp. Since that time I had loafed around
the water front, eking out an existence on a small allowance from
my family, too lazy of body and mind, too indifferent to things
in general, to ship to sea again or do anything else. I shared a
small rear room with another "gentleman-ranker," Jimmy Anderson,
an old friend of mine, over an all-night dive near South street
known as Tommy the Priest's.</p>

<p>This is the story of Jimmy, my roommate, and it begins on a
cold night in the early part of March. I had waited in Tommy the
Priest's, hunched up on a chair near the stove in the back room,
all the late afternoon until long after dark. My nerves were on
edge as a result of a two days' carouse ensuing on the receipt of
my weekly allowance. Now all that money was gone--over the
bar--and the next few days gloomed up as a dreary, sober and
hungry ordeal which must, barring miracles, be endured patiently
or otherwise. Three or four others of the crowd I knew were
sitting near me, equally sick and penniless. We stared gloomily
before us, in listless attitudes, spitting dejectedly at the
glowing paunch of the stove. Every now and then someone would
come in bringing with him a chill of the freezing wind outside.
We would all look up hopefully. No, only a stranger. Nothing in
the way of hospitality to be expected from him. "Close that
damned door!" we would growl in chorus and huddle closer to the
stove, shivering, muttering disappointed curses. In mocking
contrast the crowd at the bar were drinking, singing, arguing in
each other's ears with loud, care-free voices. None of them
noticed our existence.</p>

<p>Surely a bad night for Good Samaritans, I thought, and
reflected with bitterness that I counted several in that jubilant
throng who had eagerly accepted my favors of the two nights
previous. Now they saw me and nodded--but that was all. Suddenly
sick with human ingratitude, I got out of my chair and, grumbling
a surly "good-night, all" to the others, went out the side door
and up the rickety stairs to our room--Jimmy's and mine.</p>

<p>The thought of spending a long evening alone in the room
seemed intolerable to me. I lit the lamp and glanced around
angrily. A fine hole! The two beds took up nearly all the space
but Jimmy had managed to cram in, in front of the window, a small
table on which stood his dilapidated typewriter. The typewriter,
of course, was broken and wouldn't work. Jimmy was always going
to have it fixed--tomorrow. But then Jimmy lived in a dream of
tomorrows; and nothing he was ever associated with ever
worked.</p>

<p>The lamp on the table threw a stream of light through the
dirty window, revealing the fire-escape outside. Inside, on a
shelf along the windowsill, a dyspeptic geranium plant sulked in
a small red pot. This plant was Jimmy's garden and his joy. Even
when he was too sick to wash his own face he never forgot to
water it the first thing after getting up. It goes without
saying, the silly thing never bloomed. Nothing that Jimmy loved
ever bloomed; but he always hoped, in fact he was quite sure, it
would eventually blossom out--in the dawn of some vague
tomorrow.</p>

<p>For me it had value only as a symbol of Jimmy's everlasting
futility, of his irritating inefficiency. However, at that period
in my life, all flowers were yellow primroses and nothing more,
and Jimmy's pet was out of place, I thought, and in the way.</p>

<p>Books were piled on the floor against the walls--and what
books! Where Jimmy got them and what for, God only knows. He
never read them, except a few pages at haphazard to put him to
sleep. Yet there must have been fifty at least cluttering up the
room--books about history, about journalism, about
economics--books of impossible poetry and incredible prose,
written by unknown authors and published by firms one had never
heard of. He had a craze for buying them and never failed, on the
days he was paid for the odd bits of work he did as occasional
stenographer for a theatrical booking firm, to stagger weakly
into Tommy's, very drunk, with two or three of these unreadable
volumes clutched to his breast--books with titles like: "A
Commentary on the Bulls of Pope Leo XIII," or "God and the
Darwinian Theory" by John Jones, or "Sunflowers and Other Verses"
by Lydia Smith. Think of it!</p>

<p>I used to grow wild with rage as I watched him showing them to
Tommy, or Big John, if he was on, or to anyone else who would
look and listen, with all the besotted pride in the world. I
would think of the drinks and the food--kippered herring and
bread and good Italian cheese--he might have purchased for the
price of these dull works; and I would swear to myself to thrash
him good and hard if he even dared to speak to me.</p>

<p>And then--Jimmy would come and lay his idiotic books on my
table and I would look up at him furiously; and there he would
stand, wavering a bit, smiling his sweet, good-natured smile,
trying to force half his remaining change into my hand, his
lonely, wistful eyes watching me with the appealing look of a
lost dog hungry for an affectionate pat. What could I do but
laugh and love him and show him I did by a slap on the back or in
some small way or another? It was worth while forgetting all the
injuries in the world just to see the light of gratitude shine up
in his eyes.</p>

<p>This night I am speaking of I picked up one of the books in
desperation and lay down to read with the lamp at the head of the
bed; but I couldn't concentrate. I was too sick in body, brain,
and soul to follow even the words.</p>

<p>I threw the book aside and lay on my back staring gloomily at
the ceiling. The inmate of the next room, a broken-down
telegrapher--"the Lunger" we used to call him--had a violent
attack of coughing which seemed to be tearing his chest to
pieces. I shuddered. He used to spit blood in the back room
below. In fact, when drunk, he was quite proud of this
achievement, but grew terrified at all allusions to consumption
and wildly insisted that he only had "bloody bronchitis," and
that he was getting better every day. He died soon after in that
same room next to ours. Perhaps his treatment was at fault. A
quart and a half of five-cent whiskey a day and only a plate of
free soup at noon to eat is hardly a diet conducive to the cure
of any disease--not even "bloody bronchitis."</p>

<p>He coughed and coughed until, in a frenzy of tortured nerves,
I yelled to him: "For God's sake, shut up!" Then he subsided into
a series of groans and querulous, choking complaints. I thought
of consumption, the danger of contagion, and remembered that the
window ought to be open. But it was too cold. Besides, what was
the difference? "Con" or something else, today or tomorrow, it
was all the same--the end. What did I care? I had failed--or
rather I had never cared enough about it all to want to
succeed.</p>

<p>I must have dozed for I came to with a nervous jump to find
the lamp sputtering and smoking and the light growing dimmer
every minute. No oil! That fool Jimmy had promised to brink back
some. I had given him my last twenty cents and he had taken the
can with him. He was sober, had been for almost a week, was
suffering from one of his infrequent and brief efforts at
reformation. No, there was no excuse. I cursed him viciously for
the greatest imbecile on earth. The lamp was going out. I would
have to lie in darkness or return to the misery of the back room
downstairs.</p>

<p>Just then I recognized his step on the stairs and a moment
later he came in, bringing the oil. I glared at him. "Where've
you been?" I shouted. "Look at that lamp, you idiot! I'd have
been in the dark in another second."</p>

<p>Jimmy came forward shrinkingly, a look of deep hurt in his
faded blue eyes. He murmured something about "office" and stooped
down to fill the lamp.</p>

<p>"Office!" I taunted scornfully, "what office? What do you take
me for? I've heard that bunk of yours a million times."</p>

<p>Jimmy finished filling the lamp and sat down on the side of
his bed opposite me. He didn't answer; only stared at me with an
irritating sort of compassionate pity. How prim he was sitting
there is his black suit, wispy, grey hair combed over his bald
spot, his jowly face scraped close and chalky with too much cheap
powder, the vile odor of which filled the room. I noticed for the
first time his clean collar, his fresh shirt. He must have been
to the Chinaman's and retrieved part of his laundry. This was
what he usually did when he had a windfall of a dollar or so from
some unexpected source. Never took out all his laundry. That
would have been too expensive. Just called at the Chink's and
changed his shirt and collar. His other articles of clothing he
washed himself at the sink in the hallway.</p>

<p>I eyed him up and down resentfully. Here was a man who ought
always to remain drunk. Sober, he was a respectable nuisance. And
his shoes were shined!</p>

<p>"Why the profound meditation?" I asked. "You'd think, to look
at you, you were sitting up with my corpse. Cheer up! I feel bad
enough without your adding to the gloom."</p>

<p>"That's just it, Art," he began in slow, doleful tones. "I
hate to see you in this condition. You wouldn't ever feel this
way if you'd--only--only--" he hesitated as he saw my sneer.</p>

<p>"Only what?" I urged.</p>

<p>"Only stop your hard drinking," he mumbled, avoiding my
eyes.</p>

<p>"This is almost too much, Jimmy. The water wagon is fatal to
your sense of humor. After a week's ride you've accumulated more
cheap moralizing than any anchorite in all his years of
fasting."</p>

<p>"I'm your friend," he blundered on, "and you know it, Art--or
I wouldn't say it."</p>

<p>"And it hurts you more than it does me, I'll bet!"</p>

<p>Jimmy had the piqued air of the rebuffed but well-intentioned.
"If that's the way you want to take it--" he was staring
unhappily at the floor. We were silent for a time. Then he
continued with the obstinacy of the reformed turned reformer:
"I'm your friend, the best friend you've got." His eyes looked up
into mine and his glance was timidly questioning. "You know that,
don't you, Art?"</p>

<p>All my peevishness vanished in a flash before his woeful
sincerity. I reached over and grabbed his hand--his white, pudgy
little hand so in keeping with the rest of him--warm and soft.
"Of course I know it, Jimmy. Don't be foolish and take what I've
said seriously. I've got a full-sized grouch against everything
tonight."</p>

<p>Jimmy brightened up and cleared his throat. He evidently
thought my remarks an expression of willingness to serve as
audience for his temperance lecture. Still he hesitated politely.
"I know you don't want to listen--"</p>

<p>I laughed shortly. "Go ahead. Shoot. I'm all ears."</p>

<p>Then he began. You know the sort of drool--introduced by a
sage wag of the head and the inevitable remark: "I've been
through it all myself, and I know." I won't bore you with it.
Coming from Jimmy it was the last word in absurdity.</p>

<p>I tried not to listen, concentrating my mind on the man
himself, my nerves soothed by the monotonous flow of his
soft-voiced syllables. Yes, he'd been through it all, there was
no doubt of that, from soup to nuts. What he didn't realize was
that none of it had ever touched him deeply. Forgetful of the
last kick his eyes had always looked up at life again with the
same appealing, timid uncertainty, pleading for a caress, fearful
of a blow. And life had never failed to deal him the expected
kick, never a vicious one, more of a shove to get him out of the
way of a spirited boot at someone who really mattered. Spurned,
Jimmy had always returned, affectionate, uncomprehending, wagging
his tail ingratiatingly, so to speak. The longed-for caress would
come, he was sure of it, if not today, then tomorrow. Ah,
tomorrow!</p>

<p>I looked searchingly at his face--the squat nose, the wistful
eyes, the fleshy cheeks hanging down like dewlaps on either side
of his weak mouth with its pale, thick lips. The usual marks of
dissipation were there but none of the scars of intense
suffering. The whole effect was characterless, unfinished; as if
some sculptor at the last moment had suddenly lost interest in
his clay model of a face and abandoned his work in disgust. I
wondered what Jimmy would do if he ever saw that face in the
clear, cruel mirror of Truth. Straggle on in the same lost way,
no doubt, and cease to have faith in mirrors.</p>

<p>Although most of his lecture was being lost on me I couldn't
prevent a chance word now and then from seeping into my
consciousness. "Wasted youth--your education--ability--a
shame--lost opportunity--drink--some nice girl"--these words my
ears retained against my will, and each word had a sting to it.
Gradually my feeling of kindliness toward Jimmy petered out. I
began to hate him for a pestiferous little crank. What right had
he to meddle with my sins? Some of the things he was saying were
true; and truth--that kind of truth--should be seen and not
heard.</p>

<p>I was becoming angry enough to shrivel him up with some
contemptuous remark about his hypocrisy and the doubtful duration
of time he would stay on the wagon when he suddenly disgressed
from my misdeeds and began virtuously holding himself up as a
horrible example.</p>

<p>He began at the beginning, and, even though I welcomed the
change of subject, I swore inwardly at the prospect of hearing
the history of his life all over again. He had told me this tale
at least fifty times while in all stages of maudlin drunkenness.
Usually he wept--which was sometimes funny and sometimes not,
depending on my own condition. At all events it would be a
novelty to hear his sober version. I might get at some facts this
time.</p>

<p>To my surprise this story seemed to be identical with the
others I had been lulled to sleep by on so many nights. Making
allowances for the natural exaggeration of one in liquor, there
was but little difference. It started with the Anderson estate in
Scotland where Jimmy had spent his boyhood. This estate of the
family extended over the greater part of a Scotch county, so
Jimmy claimed, and he was touchy when anyone seemed skeptical
regarding its existence.</p>

<p>He loved to dilate on the beauty of the country, the old manor
house, the farms, the game park, and all the rest of it. All this
was heavily mortgaged, he admitted; and he was not in good
standing with most of his relatives on the other side; but he
declared that there was one aunt, far gone in years and hoarded
wealth, who still treasured his memory, and he promised all the
gang in the back room a rare blowout should the old lady pass
away in the proper frame of mind. To all of this the crowd would
listen with an amiable pretence of belief. For, after all, he was
Jimmy and they all swore by him, and a fairy tale like that is no
great matter to hold against a man.</p>

<p>But here he was spinning the same yarn in all its details! I
looked at him suspiciously. No, he was certainly stone sober.
Could there be any truth in it then? Impossible. I finally
concluded that Jimmy, after the fashion of liars, had ended by
mistaking his own fabrications for fact.</p>

<p>He continued on through his years in Edinburgh University, his
graduation with honors, his going into journalism first in
Scotland, then in England, afterwards as a correspondent on the
Continent, and finally his work in South Africa during the Boer
War as representative of some news service.</p>

<p>I had never been able to verify any of this except that
relating to the Boer War. An old friend of his had once told me
that Jimmy did hold a responsible position in South Africa during
the war and had received a large salary. Then the old friend,
old-friendlike, shook his head gravely and muttered: "Too bad!
Too bad! Drink!" Whether the rest of Jimmy's life, as related by
him, had ever been lived or not hardly mattered, I thought.
Undoubtedly he had been well educated and what is called a
gentleman over there. Of course the Anderson estate was a work of
fiction, or, at best, a glorified country house.</p>

<p>"And mind you, Art, up to that time," Jimmy's story had
reached the point where he was at the front in South Africa for
the news service company, "I had never touched a drop except a
glass of wine with dinner now and again. That was ten years ago
and I was thirty-five. Then--something happened. Ten years," he
repeated sadly, "and now look where I am!" He stared despondently
before him for a moment, then brightened up and squared his bent
shoulders. "But that's all past and gone now, and I'm through
with this kind of life for good and all."</p>

<p>"There's always tomorrow," I ventured ironically.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm going to make the most of it." His eyes were
bright with the dream of a new hope; or rather, the old hope
eternally redreamed. He glanced at the table. "I'll have to have
that typewriter fixed up."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, tomorrow, if I can spare the time." He hadn't noticed my
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Why, is your day all taken up?" I asked, marvelling at his
imagination.</p>

<p>"Pretty well so." He put on an air of importance. "I saw
Edwards today"--Edwards was a friend of his who had risen to be
an editor on one of the big morning papers--"and he's found an
opening for me--a real opening which will give me an opportunity
to show them all I'm still in the race."</p>

<p>"And you start in tomorrow?" I was dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Yes, in the afternoon." His face was alive with energy. "Oh,
I'll show them all, Art, that I'm still one of the best when I
want to be. They've sneered at me long enough."</p>

<p>"Then you really are about to become a wage slave?" I simply
couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>"Honestly, Art. Tomorrow. Do you think I'm spoofing you about
it?"</p>

<p>"I must admit you seem to be confessing the shameless truth.
Well, at any rate, you seem to be pleased, so--" here I jumped up
and pumped his hand up and down--"a million congratulations,
Jimmy, old scout!" Jimmy's joy was good to see. There were tears
in his eyes as he thanked me. Good old Jimmy! It took him quite a
while to get over his emotion. Then, as if he had suddenly
remembered something, he began hurriedly fumbling through all his
pockets.</p>

<p>"I must have lost it," he said finally, giving up the search.
"I wanted to show it to you."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"A letter I received today from Aunt Mary." Aunt Mary was the
elderly relative in whose will Jimmy hoped to be remembered. "She
complains of having felt very feeble for the past half year. She
appears to be entirely ignorant of my present condition, thank
God. Writes that I'm to come and pay her a long visit should I
decide to take a trip abroad this Spring. Fancy!"</p>

<p>"And you've lost the letter?" I asked, trying to hide my
skepticism.</p>

<p>"Yes--was showing it to Edwards--must have dropped on the
floor--or else he--" Jimmy stopped abruptly. I think he must have
sensed my amused incredulity, for he seemed very put out at
something and didn't look at me. "I do hope the poor old lady
isn't seriously ill," he murmured after a pause.</p>

<p>"What!" I laughed. "Have you the face to tell me that, when
you know you've been looking forward to her timely taking off
ever since I've known you?"</p>

<p>Jimmy's face grew red and he stammered confusedly. He knew
he'd said things which might have sounded that way when he'd been
drinking. It was whiskey talking and he didn't mean it. Really he
liked her a lot. He remembered she'd been very kind to him when
he was a lad. Had hardly seen her since then--twenty-five years
ago. No, money or no money, he wanted her to live to be a
hundred.</p>

<p>"But you've told me she's almost ninety now! Isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, eighty-six, I think."</p>

<p>"Then," I said with finality, "she's overlingered her welcome,
and you're a simpleton to be wasting your crocodile tears--in
advance, at that. Besides, I've never noticed her sending you any
of her vast fortune. She might at least have made you a present
once in a while if she cared to earn any regrets over her
demise."</p>

<p>"I've never written her about my hard luck. I hardly ever
wrote to her," Jimmy said slowly. His tones were ridiculously
dismal, and he sat holding his face in his hands in the woebegone
attitude of a mourner.</p>

<p>"Well, you should have written." A sudden thought made me
smile. "What will the bunch in the back room say when they hear
this? You may give them that long-promised blowout--tomorrow," I
added maliciously.</p>

<p>Jimmy stirred uneasily and turned on me a glance full of dim
suspicion. "Why do you keep repeating that word tomorrow? You've
said it now a dozen times."</p>

<p>"Because tomorrow is your day, Jimmy," I answered carelessly.
"Doesn't your career as a sober, industrious citizen begin
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he sighed with relief, "I thought--" he walked up and
down in the narrow space between the beds, his hands deep in his
pockets. Finally he stopped and stood beside me. There was an
exultant ring to his voice. "Ah, I tell you, Art, it's great to
feel like a man again, to know you're done for good and all with
that mess downstairs." After a pause he went on in a coaxing,
motherly tone. "Don't you think you ought to go to work and do
something? I hate to see you--like this. You know what a pal I
am, Art. You can listen to me. It's a shame for you to let
yourself go to seed this way. Really, Art, I mean it."</p>

<p>"Now, Jimmy," I got up and put my hands on his shoulders. "I
say it without any hard feeling, but I've had about enough of
your reform movement for one night. It'll be more truly
charitable of you to offer me the price of a drink--if you have
it. Your day of reformation is none so remote you can't realize
from experience how rotten I feel. I can hear polar bears baying
at the Northern Lights."</p>

<p>Jimmy sighed disconsolately and dug some small change out of
his pocket. "I borrowed a dollar from Edwards," he explained.
"I'll pay him back out of my first salary." The self-sufficient
pride he put into that word salary!</p>

<p>But his financial aid proved to be unnecessary. As I was about
to take half of his change, there was a great trampling from the
stairs outside. Our door was kicked open with a bang and Lyons,
the stoker, and Paddy Mehan, the old deep-water sailor, came
crowding into the room. Lyons was in the first jovial frenzy of
drink but poor Paddy was already awash and rapidly sinking. They
had been paid off that afternoon after a trip across on the
American liner St. Paul.</p>

<p>"Hello, Lyons! Hello, Paddy!" Jimmy and I hailed them in
pleased chorus.</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself!" Lyons crushed Jimmy's hand in one huge paw
and patted me affectionately on the back with the other. The jar
of it nearly knocked me off my feet but I managed to smile. Lyons
and I were old pals. I had once made a trip as sailor on the
Philadelphia when he was in her stokehold, and we had become
great friends through a chance adventure together ashore in
Southampton--which is another story. He stood grinning, swaying a
bit in the lamplight, a great, hard bulk of a man, dwarfing the
proportions of our little room. Paddy lurched over to one of the
beds and fell on it. "Thick weather! Thick weather!" he groaned
to himself, and started to sing an old chanty in a thin,
quavering, nasal whine.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A-roving, a-roving<br>
 Since roving's been my ru-i-in,<br>
 No more I'll go a-ro-o-ving with you, fair maid."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>"Shut up!" roared Lyons and turned again to me. "Art, how are
ye?" I dodged an attempt at another love-tap and replied that I
was well but thirsty.</p>

<p>"Thirsty, is ut? D'ye hear that, Paddy, ye slimy Corkonian?
Here's a mate complainin' av thirst and we wid a full pay day in
our pockets." He pulled out a roll of bills and flaunted them
before me with a splendid, spendthrift gesture.</p>

<p>"Oh, whiskey killed my poor old dad! Whiskey! O Johnny!"
carolled Paddy dolorously.</p>

<p>"Listen to 'im!" Lyons reached over and shook him vigorously.
"That's the throuble wid all thim lazy, deck-scrubbers the loike
av 'im. They can't stand up to their dhrink loike men. Wake up,
Paddy! We'll be goin' below." He hauled Paddy to his feet and
held him there. Come on, Art. There's some av the boys ye know
below waitin'. Ye'll have all the dhrink ye can pour down your
throat, and welcome; and anything more you're wishful for ye've
but to name. Come on, Jimmy, you're wan av us."</p>

<p>"I've got something to do before I go down. I'll join you in a
few minutes," Jimmy replied, wisely evading a direct refusal.</p>

<p>"See that ye do, me sonny boy," warned Lyons, pushing Paddy to
the door. I turned to Jimmy as I was going out. "Well, good luck
till tomorrow, Jimmy, if I don't see you before then."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Art," he murmured huskily and shook my hand. I
started down. From the bottom of the flight below I heard Lyons'
rough curses and Paddy wailing lugubriously: "Old Joe is dead,
and gone to hell, poor old Joe!"</p>

<p>"Ye'll be in hell yourself if ye fall in this black hole,"
Lyons cautioned, steering him to the top of the second flight as
I caught up with them.</p>

<p>The fiesta which began with our arrival in the bar didn't
break up until long after daylight the next morning. It was one
of the old, lusty debauches of my sailor days--songs of the sea
and yarns about ships punctuated by rounds of drinks.</p>

<p>The last I remember was Lyons bawling out for someone to come
down to the docks and strip to him and see which was the better
man. "Have a bit av fun wid 'im" was the way he put it. I believe
I was Dutch-courageous enough to accept his challenge but he
pushed me back in my chair with a warning to be "a good bye" or
I'd get a spanking. So the party had no fatal ending.</p>

<p>As you can well imagine I slept like a corpse all the next day
and didn't witness Jimmy's departure for his long hard climb back
to respectability and the man who was. When he came home that
night he appeared very elated, full of the dignity of labor,
tremendously conscious of his position in life, provokingly
solicitous concerning my welfare. It would have been insufferable
in anyone else; but Jimmy--well, Jimmy was Jimmy, and the most
lovable chap on earth. You couldn't stay mad at him more than a
minute, if you had the slightest sense of humor.</p>

<p>Had he toiled and spun much on his first day, I asked him. No,
he admitted after a moment's hesitation, he had spent the time
mostly in feeling about, getting the hang of his work. Now
tomorrow he'd get the typewriter fixed so he could do Sunday
special stuff in his spare moments--stories of what he'd seen in
South Africa and things of that kind. Wasn't that a bully idea? I
agreed that it was, and retreated to the gang below who were
still celebrating, leaving Jimmy with pencil poised over a blank
sheet of paper determined to map out one of his stories then and
there.</p>

<p>I didn't see him the next day or the day after. I was touring
the water front with Lyons and Paddy and never returned to the
room. The fourth day of his job I ran into him for a second in
the hallway. He said hello in a hurried tone and brushed past me.
For my part I was glad he didn't stop. I felt he'd immediately
start on a heart-to-heart talk which I was in no mood to hear.
Later on I remembered his manner had been strange and that he
looked drawn and fagged out.</p>

<p>The fifth day Paddy and Lyons were both broke, but I collected
my puny allowance and we sat at a table in the back room
squandering it lingeringly on enormous scoops of lager and porter
which were filling and lasted a long time. We were still sitting
there talking when Jimmy came back from work. He looked in from
the hallway, saw us and nodded, but went on upstairs without
speaking.</p>

<p>"What's the matther wid Jimmy?" grumbled Lyons. "Can't he
speak to a man?"</p>

<p>"He looks like he was sick," said Paddy. "Go up, Art, that's a
good lad, and ask him if he won't take a bit of a drink,
maybe."</p>

<p>"I'll go," I said, getting up, "but he won't drink anything.
Jimmy's strictly temperance these days. He's more likely to give
us all a sermon on our sins."</p>

<p>"Divil take him, then," growled Lyons, "but run and get him
all the same. He looks loike he'd been drawn through a crack in
the wall."</p>

<p>I ran quickly up the stairs and opened the door of our room.
Jimmy was sitting on the side of his bed, his head in his hands.
I glanced at the typewriter. The keys were still grey with a
layer of long-accumulated dust. Then he hadn't had it fixed. The
same old tomorrow, I thought to myself.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," I called to him. He jumped to his feet with a
frightened start. When he saw who it was a flush of anger came
over his face.</p>

<p>"Why don't you scare the life out of a man!" he said
irritably. I was astonished. I'd never known him to flare up like
this over a trifle.</p>

<p>"Come down and join us for a while. You don't have to drink,
you know. You look done-up. What's the trouble--been working too
hard?"</p>

<p>He winced at this last remark as if I'd shaken my fist in his
face. Then he made a frantic gesture with his arms as though he
were pushing me out of the room. "Go! Go back!" His voice was
unnaturally shrill. "Leave me alone. I want to be alone."</p>

<p>"Jimmy!" I went to him in genuine alarm. "What's the matter?
Anything wrong?"</p>

<p>He pressed my hand and tried a feeble attempt at a smile.
There were dark rings under his eyes, and, somehow, in some
indefinable manner, he seemed years older, a broken old man.</p>

<p>"No, Art, I'm all right. Don't mind me. I've a splitting
headache--"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool and let them work you to death." He raised
his hands as if he were going to clap them over his ears to shut
out my words.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone, Art, will you? I'm going to bed," he
stammered.</p>

<p>"Right-o, that's the stuff. Get a good sleep and you'll be O.
K." I went downstairs slowly, vaguely worried about him,
wondering what the trouble could be. In the end I laid his
peculiar actions to a struggle he was having with his craving for
drink. Paddy and Lyons agreed with this opinion and called him a
"game little swine" for sticking to his guns. And as such we
toasted him in our lager and porter.</p>

<p>When I went up to the room to turn in he was asleep, or
pretending to be, and I was careful not to disturb him. The next
morning I heard him moving about, but as soon as he saw I was
awake, he appeared in a nervous flurry to get away, and we didn't
speak more than a few words to each other. That night he never
came home at all. I went to bed early--everyone was broke and
there was nothing else to do--and when I was roused out of my
slumber by the sun shining on my face through the dirty window, I
saw that his bed hadn't been touched. A somber presentiment of
evil seemed to hover around that bed. The white spread,
threadbare and full of holes, which he had tucked in with such
precise neatness, had the suggestion of a shroud about it--a
shroud symbolically woven for one whose life had been threadbare
and full of holes.</p>

<p>I tried to laugh at such grim imaginings. Jimmy had stayed
with Edwards or someone else from his paper. What was strange in
that? This wasn't the first time he'd remained away all night,
was it? If I was to give way to such worries I might just as well
put on skirts and be done with it.</p>

<p>But my phantoms, however foolish, refused to be laid. I got
dressed in a hurry, anxious to escape from this room, bright with
sunlight, dark with uncanny threat. Before I went down, struck by
a sentimental mood, I got some water from the sink in the hallway
and poured it on his ridiculous geranium plant.</p>

<p>After a breakfast of free soup, I walked with Paddy and Lyons
down to the Battery. We spent the afternoon there, lounging on
one of the benches. It was as warm as a day in Spring and we sat
blinking in the sunshine drowsily listening to each other's yarns
about the sea and lazily watching the passing ships.</p>

<p>When the sun went down we returned to Tommy the Priest's. On
the way back I remembered this was Jimmy's pay day and wondered
if he would show up. He owed me some money which I hoped would be
forthcoming. Otherwise the night was liable to prove an
uneventful one. And a farewell bust-up was imperative because
Paddy and Lyons would have to go on board ship the following day
if they wanted to make the next trip.</p>

<p>The evening didn't pass off as dully as we had feared. Old
McDonald, the printer, was in a festive mood and invited us to
join him. Two of the telegraph operators, out of a job at that
time, had borrowed some money somewhere and were anxious to
return the many treats they had received from us in the past. So
the time whiled away very pleasantly.</p>

<p>It was shortly after midnight when Jimmy came in. As soon as I
saw his face I knew that something had happened to him, something
very serious. He was incredibly haggard and pale, and there were
deep lines of suffering about his mouth and eyes. His eyes--I
can't describe them. There was nothing behind them. He nodded and
took his place at the bar beside us. Then he spoke, asked us what
we'd have, in a strained, forced voice as though it cost him a
tremendous effort to talk. He took whiskey himself, poured out a
glass brim full, and downed it straight. Big John changed a bill
for him, and without looking at me, he held out the couple of
dollars he owed me. I put them in my pocket. Jimmy motioned to
Big John and called for another round. A spell of silence was on
the whole barroom. Everyone there knew him well. They had all
joked with him during the week about his being on the wagon, but
they had secretly admired his firmness of will. Now they stared
at him with genuine regret that he should have fallen. Their
faces grew sad. They had done the same thing themselves so many
times. They understood.</p>

<p>"Jimmy!" He caught the reproach in my voice and turned to me
with a twisted smile. "It doesn't matter," he said. "Nothing
matters." His voice became harsh. "Don't forget what you said
about my lectures and start in yourself." He immediately felt
sorry for having said this. "No, Art, I don't mean that. Never
mind what I say. I'm upset--about something."</p>

<p>"Tell me what it is, Jimmy. Maybe I can help."</p>

<p>"Help?" He laughed hysterically. "No, no help please. After
all, why shouldn't I tell you now? You're bound to find out
sooner or later. They'll all know it." He indicated the others
who, feeling that Jimmy wanted to be alone with me, had taken
their drinks to a table in the rear and were sitting around
talking in low, constrained voices. Jimmy blurted out: "My job,
Art, is gone to hell!"</p>

<p>"What!" I pretended more astonishment than I felt. I had
guessed what the trouble was.</p>

<p>"Yes, they asked me to quit--politely requested. Edwards was
very nice about it--very kind--very charitable." He put all the
bitterness of his heart into these last words.</p>

<p>"The rotten swine!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Art, it wasn't his fault. If they hadn't--fired
me--I'd have had to resign anyway. I--I couldn't do the
work."</p>

<p>"That's all nonsense, Jimmy. Well, cheer up. All said and
done, it's only a job the less. You can always get another for
the asking."</p>

<p>He looked at me with a sort of wild scorn in his eyes. "Can't
you understand any better than that? What do I care for the job
itself? It isn't that. I tell you I couldn't do the work! I tried
and tried. What I wrote was rot. I couldn't get any news. No
initiative--no imagination--no character--no courage! All gone.
Nothing left--not even cleverness. No memory even!" He stopped,
breathing hard, the perspiration glistening on his forehead. "It
came to me gradually--therealization. I couldn't believe it. I
had been so sure of myself all these years. All I needed was a
chance. It had been so easy for me in the past--long ago. These
last few days I've guessed the truth. I've been going crazy. Last
night I walked--walked and walked--thinking--and finally--I
knew!" He paused, choking back a sob, his face twitching
convulsively with the effort he made to control himself. Then he
uttered a cracked sound intended for a laugh. "I'm done--burnt
out--wasted! It's time to dump the garbage. Nothing here." He
tapped his head with a silly gesture and laughed again. I began
to be afraid he really was going mad. "No, Art, it isn't the job
that's lost. I'm lost!"</p>

<p>"Now you're talking like a fool!" I spoke roughly, trying to
shake him out of this mood.</p>

<p>"I won't talk any more," he said quite calmly. "Don't worry.
I'm all shot to pieces--no sleep." He broke down suddenly and
turned away from me. "But it's hell, Art, to realize all at
once--you're dead!"</p>

<p>I put my arm around his shoulders. "Have a drink, Jimmy. Hey
you, John, a little service!" What else was there to do? Life had
jammed the clear, cruel mirror in front of his eyes and he had
recognized himself--in that pitiful thing he saw. "Have a drink,
Jimmy, and forget it. Take a real drink!" I urged. What else was
there to do?</p>

<p>After we had had a couple at the bar, Jimmy filling his glass
to the brim each time, I led him in back and we sat down at the
table with the crowd. More drinks were immediately forthcoming,
and it wasn't long before Jimmy became very drunk. He didn't say
anything but his eyes glazed, his lips drooped loosely, his head
wagged uncertainly from side to side. I saw he'd had enough and I
hoped his tired brain had been numbed to a forgetful
oblivion.</p>

<p>"Come on to bed, Jimmy," I shook him by the arm.</p>

<p>He stared at me vacantly. "Bed--yes--sleep! sleep!" he
mumbled, and came with me willingly enough. I helped him up the
stairs to the room and lit the lamp. He sat on the side of the
bed, swaying, unlacing his shoes with difficulty. Presently he
began to weep softly to himself. "It's you, Alice--cause of all
this--damn you--no--didn't mean that--beg pardon," he muttered.
He lifted his head and saw me sitting on the other bed. "One word
advice, Art--never get married--all rotten, all of 'em--"</p>

<p>This was something new. "What do you know about marriage?" I
asked curiously. "Nothing from experience, surely."</p>

<p>He winked at me with drunken cunning. "Don't I, though! Not
half! Never told you that, what? Never told you what
happened--Cape Town?"</p>

<p>"No, you never did. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Might s'well tell Art--best friend--tell you everything
tonight--all over. Yes--married in England--English girl,
pretty's picture--big blue eyes--just before war--took her South
Africa with me, 'n left her in Cape Town when I went to front. I
was called back to Cape Town s'denly--found her with staff
officer--dirty swine! No chance for doubt--didn't expect me to
turn up--saw them with my own eyes--<i>flagrante delictu,</i> you
know--dirty swine of a staff officer! Good bye, Jimmy Anderson!
All over! Drink! Drink! Forget!" He blubbered to himself, his
face a grotesque masque of tragedy.</p>

<p>In a flash it came back to me how he'd always stopped in the
stories of his life at the point where he'd commenced drinking.
Even at his drunkest he'd always ended the history there by
saying abruptly: "and then--something happened." I'd never
attached much importance to it--thought he merely wanted to
suggest a mysterious reason as an excuse for his tobogganing.
Now, I knew. Who could doubt the truth of his statements, knowing
all he had been through that day? He was in a mood for truth. So
this was the something which happened! Here was real tragedy.</p>

<p>Real tragedy! And there he was sobbing, hiccuping, rolling his
eyes stupidly, scratching with limp fingers at the tears which
ran down and tickled the sides of his nose. I felt a mad desire
to laugh.</p>

<p>"I suppose you and she were divorced?" I asked after a
pause.</p>

<p>"No--I couldn't--no proof--no money. Besides, what'd I care
about divorce? Never want to marry again--never love anyone
else." He wept more violently than ever.</p>

<p>"But didn't she get a divorce?"</p>

<p>"No, she's too cute for that--thinks Aunt Mary'll leave me
money--and I'll drink myself to death. No," he interrupted
himself hastily, "can't be that--not s'bad s' that--not
Alice--no, no, mustn't say that--not right for me to say
that--don't know her reason--never can tell--about women. Damn
shoes!" He gave up the attempt to get his shoes off and flung
himself on the bed, fully dressed. In a minute he was dead to the
world and snoring. I left him and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Most of the people in the back room were asleep, but Paddy and
Lyons and the operators were still drinking at one table, and I
sat down with them. I talked at random on every subject that came
up, seeking to forget Jimmy and his woes, for a time at least.
His two confessions that night had got on my nerves.</p>

<p>Later on I must have dozed, for I was jolted out of a half
dream by a sharp cracking smash in the back yard. Everyone was
awake and cursing in an instant. Big John appeared from behind
the curtain, grumbling: "Dot's right! Leave bottle on the fire
escape, you fellers! Dot's right! Und I have to sweep up."</p>

<p>We heard someone racing down the stairs and Jimmy burst into
the room. His face was livid, his eyes popping out of his head.
He rushed to the chair beside me and sat down, shaking, his teeth
chattering as if he had a chill. I told Big John to bring him a
drink.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble now, Jimmy?" I asked him when he'd calmed
down a little. He appeared to be quite sober after his sleep.</p>

<p>"The geranium--" he began, his lips trembling, his eyes
filling up.</p>

<p>"So that's what fell down just now, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I woke up, and I remembered I'd forgotten to water it. I
got up and went to get the water. The window was open. I must
have stumbled over something. I put out my hand to steady myself.
It was so dark I couldn't see. I knocked it out on the fire
escape. Then I heard it crash in the yard." He put his hands over
his face and cried heart-brokenly like a sick child whose only
remaining toy has been smashed. Not drunken tears this time, but
real tears which made all of us at the table blink our eyes and
swear fiercely at nothing.</p>

<p>After a while he grew quiet again, attempted a smile, asked
our pardons for having created a foolish scene. He stared at his
drink standing untouched on the table in front of him; but never
made any motion to take it, didn't seem to realize what it was.
For fully fifteen minutes he sat and stared, as still as stone,
never moving his eyes, never even seeming to breathe. Then he got
up from his chair and walked slowly to the door like a man in a
trance. As he was going out he turned to me and said: "I'm tired,
Art. I think I'll go to sleep," and something like a wan smile
trembled on his pale lips. He left the door open behind him and I
heard him climbing the stairs, and the slam of our door as he
closed it behind him.</p>

<p>A buzz of conversation broke out as if his going had lifted a
weight of silence off the roomful of men. Then it happened--a
swish, a sickish thud as of a heavy rock dropping into thick mud.
We looked wildly at one another. We knew. We rushed into the hall
and out to the yard. There it was--a motionless, dark huddle of
clothes, a splintered, protruding bone or two, a widening pool of
blood black against the grey flags--Jimmy!</p>

<p>The sky was pale with the light of dawn. Tomorrow had
come.</p>
