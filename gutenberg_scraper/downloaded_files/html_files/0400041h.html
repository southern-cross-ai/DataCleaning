<p><a href="#a01">ACT ONE</a></p>

<p>The farmhouse. Around noon. Early September, 1923.</p>

<p><a href="#a02">ACT TWO</a></p>

<p>The same, but with the interior of sitting room revealed--11
o'clock that night.</p>

<p><a href="#a03">ACT THREE</a></p>

<p>The same as Act One. No time elapses between Acts Two and
Three.</p>

<p>The same--Dawn of the following morning.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE OF THE PLAY</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The play takes place in Connecticut at the home of tenant
farmer, Phil Hogan, between the hours of noon on a day in early
September, 1923, and sunrise of the following day.</p>

<p>The house is not, to speak mildly, a fine example of New
England architecture, placed so perfectly in its setting that it
appears a harmonious part of the landscape, rooted in the earth.
It has been moved to its present site, and looks it. An old
boxlike, clapboarded affair, with a shingled roof and brick
chimney, it is propped up about two feet above ground by layers
of timber blocks. There are two windows on the lower floor of
this side of the house which faces front, and one window on the
floor above. These windows have no shutters, curtains or shades.
Each has at least one pane missing, a square of cardboard taking
its place. The house had once been painted a repulsive yellow
with brown trim, but the walls now are a blackened and weathered
gray, flaked with streaks and splotches of dim lemon. Just around
the left corner of the house, a flight of steps leads to the
front door.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, a one-story, one-room addition has been
tacked on at right. About twelve feet long by six high, this
room, which is Josie Hogan's bedroom, is evidently homemade. Its
walls and sloping roof are covered with tar paper, faded to dark
gray. Close to where it joins the house, there is a door with a
flight of three unpainted steps leading to the ground. At right
of door is a small window.</p>

<p>From these steps there is a footpath going around an old pear
tree, at right-rear, through a field of hay stubble to a patch of
woods. The same path also extends left to join a dirt road which
leads up from the county highway (about a hundred yards off left)
to the front door of the house, and thence back through a
scraggly orchard of apple trees to the barn. Close to the house,
under the window next to Josie's bedroom, there is a big boulder
with a flat-top.</p>

<h1>ACT ONE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>As described. It is just before noon. The day is
clear and hot.</i></p>

<p><i>The door of Josie's bedroom opens and she comes out on the
steps, bending to avoid bumping her head.</i></p>

<p><i>Josie is twenty-eight. She is so oversize for a woman that
she is almost a freak--five feet eleven in her stockings and
weighs around one hundred and eighty. Her sloping shoulders are
broad, her chest deep with large, firm breasts, her waist wide
but slender by contrast with her hips and thighs. She has long
smooth arms, immensely strong, although no muscles show. The same
is true of her legs.</i></p>

<p><i>She is more powerful than any but an exceptionally strong
man, able to do the manual labor of two ordinary men. But there
is no mannish quality about her. She is all woman.</i></p>

<p><i>The map of Ireland is stamped on her face, with its long
upper lip and small nose, thick black eyebrows, black hair as
coarse as a horse's mane, freckled, sunburned fair skin, high
cheekbones and heavy jaw. It is not a pretty face, but her large
dark-blue eyes give it a note of beauty, and her smile, revealing
even white teeth, gives it charm.</i></p>

<p><i>She wears a cheap, sleeveless, blue cotton dress. Her feet
are bare, the soles earth-stained and tough as leather.</i></p>

<p><i>She comes down the steps and goes left to the corner of the
house and peers around it toward the barn. Then she moves swiftly
to the right of the house and looks back.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JOSIE--Ah, thank God. (<i>She goes back toward the steps as
her brother, Mike, appears hurrying up from right-rear.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Mike Hogan is twenty, about four inches shorter than his
sister. He is sturdily built, but seems almost puny compared to
her. He has a common Irish face, its expression sullen, or slyly
cunning, or primly self-righteous. He never forgets that he is a
good Catholic, faithful to all the observances, and so is one of
the &eacute;lite of Almighty God in a world of damned sinners
composed of Protestants and bad Catholics. In brief, Mike is a
New England Irish Catholic Puritan, Grade B, and an extremely
irritating youth to have around.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Mike wears dirty overalls, a sweat-stained brown shirt. He
carries a pitchfork.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Bad luck to you for a slowpoke. Didn't I tell you
half-past eleven?</p>

<p>MIKE--How could I sneak here sooner with him peeking round the
corner of the barn to catch me if I took a minute's rest, the way
he always does? I had to wait till he went to the pig pen. (<i>He
adds viciously</i>) Where he belongs, the old hog! (<i>Josie's
right arm strikes with surprising swiftness and her big hand
lands on the side of his jaw. She means it to be only a slap, but
his head jerks back and he stumbles, dropping the pitchfork, and
pleads cringingly</i>) Don't hit me, Josie! Don't, now!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>quietly</i>) Then keep your tongue off him. He's my
father, too, and I like him, if you don't.</p>

<p>MIKE--(<i>out of her reach--sullenly</i>) You're two of a
kind, and a bad kind.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>good-naturedly</i>) I'm proud of it. And I didn't
hit you, or you'd be flat on the ground. It was only a love tap
to waken your wits, so you'll use them. If he catches you running
away, he'll beat you half to death. Get your bag now. I've packed
it. It's inside the door of my room with your coat laid over it.
Hurry now, while I see what he's doing. (<i>She moves quickly to
peer around the corner of the house at left. He goes up the steps
into her room and returns carrying an old coat and a cheap
bulging satchel. She comes back.</i>) There's no sight of him.
(<i>Mike drops the satchel on the ground while he puts on the
coat.</i>) I put everything in the bag. You can change to your
Sunday suit in the can at the station or in the train, and don't
forget to wash your face. I know you want to look your best when
our brother, Thomas, sees you on his doorstep. (<i>Her tone
becomes derisively amused.</i>) And him way up in the world, a
noble sergeant of the Bridgeport police. Maybe he'll get you on
the force. It'd suit you. I can see you leading drunks to the
lockup while you give them a lecture on temperance. Or if Thomas
can't get you a job, he'll pass you along to our brother, John,
the noble barkeep in Meriden. He'll teach you the trade. You'll
make a nice one, who'll never steal from the till, or drink, and
who'll tell customers they've had enough and better go home just
when they're beginning to feel happy. (<i>She sighs
regretfully.</i>) Ah, well, Mike, you was born a priest's pet,
and there's no help for it.</p>

<p>MIKE--That's right! Make fun of me again, because I want to be
decent.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You're worse than decent. You're virtuous.</p>

<p>MIKE--Well, that's a thing nobody can say about--(<i>He stops,
a bit ashamed, but mostly afraid to finish.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>amused</i>) About me? No, and what's more, they
don't. (<i>She smiles mockingly.</i>) I know what a trial it's
been to you, Mike, having a sister who's the scandal of the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>MIKE--It's you that's saying it, not me. I don't want to part
with hard feelings. And I'll keep on praying for you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>roughly</i>) Och! To hell with your prayers!</p>

<p>MIKE--(<i>stiffly</i>) I'm going. (<i>He picks up his
bag.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her manner softening</i>) Wait. (<i>She comes to
him.</i>) Don't mind my rough tongue, Mike. I'm sorry to see you
go, but it's the best thing for you. That's why I'm helping you,
the same as I helped Thomas and John. You can't stand up to the
Old Man any more than Thomas or John could, and the old divil
would always keep you a slave. I wish you all the luck in the
world, Mike. I know you'll get on--and God bless you. (<i>Her
voice has softened, and she blinks back tears. She kisses
him--then fumbling in the pocket of her dress, pulls out a little
roll of one-dollar bills and presses it in his hand.</i>) Here's
a little present over your fare. I took it from his little green
bag, and won't he be wild when he finds out! But I can handle
him.</p>

<p>MIKE--(<i>enviously</i>) You can. You're the only one.
(<i>gratefully moved for a second</i>) Thank you, Josie. You've a
kind heart. (<i>then virtuously</i>) But I don't like taking
stolen money.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Don't be a bigger jackass than you are already. Tell
your conscience it's a bit of the wages he's never given you.</p>

<p>MIKE--That's true, Josie. It's rightfully mine. (<i>He shoves
the money into his pocket.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Get along now, so you won't miss the trolley. And don't
forget to get off the train at Bridgeport. Give my love to Thomas
and John. No, never mind. They've not written me in years. Give
them a boot in the tail for me.</p>

<p>MIKE--That's nice talk for a woman. You've a tongue as dirty
as the Old Man's.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>impatiently</i>) Don't start preaching, like you
love to, or you'll never go.</p>

<p>MIKE--You're as bad as he is, almost. It's his influence made
you what you are, and him always scheming how he'll cheat people,
selling them a broken-down nag or a sick cow or pig that he's
doctored up to look good for a day or two. It's no better than
stealing, and you help him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I do. Sure, it's grand fun.</p>

<p>MIKE--You ought to marry and have a home of your own away from
this shanty and stop your shameless ways with men. (<i>He adds,
not without moral satisfaction</i>) Though it'd be hard to find a
decent man who'd have you now.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I don't want a decent man, thank you. They're no fun.
They're all sticks like you. And I wouldn't marry the best man on
earth and be tied down to him alone.</p>

<p>MIKE--(<i>with a cunning leer</i>) Not even Jim Tyrone, I
suppose? (<i>She stares at him.</i>) You'd like being tied to
money, I know that, and he'll be rich when his mother's estate is
settled. (<i>sarcastically</i>) I suppose you've never thought of
that? Don't tell me! I've watched you making sheep's eyes at
him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>contemptuously</i>) So I'm leading Jim on to
propose, am I?</p>

<p>MIKE--I know it's crazy, but maybe you're hoping if you got
hold of him alone when he's mad drunk--Anyway, talk all you
please to put me off, I'll bet my last penny you've cooked up
some scheme to hook him, and the Old Man put you up to it. Maybe
he thinks if he caught you with Jim and had witnesses to prove
it, and his shotgun to scare him--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>controlling her anger</i>) You're full of bright
thoughts. I wouldn't strain my brains any more, if I was you.</p>

<p>MIKE--Well, I wouldn't put it past the Old Man to try any
trick. And I wouldn't put it past you, God forgive you. You've
never cared about your virtue, or what man you went out with.
You've always been brazen as brass and proud of your disgrace.
You can't deny that, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I don't. (<i>then ominously</i>) You'd better shut up
now. I've been holding my temper, because we're saying good-bye.
(<i>She stands up.</i>) But I'm losing patience.</p>

<p>MIKE--(<i>hastily</i>) Wait till I finish and you won't be mad
at me. I was going to say I wish you luck with your scheming, for
once. I hate Jim Tyrone's guts, with his quotin' Latin and his
high-toned Jesuit College education, putting on airs as if he was
too good to wipe his shoes on me, when he's nothing but a drunken
bum who never done a tap of work in his life, except acting on
the stage while his father was alive to get him the jobs.
(<i>vindictively</i>) I'll pray you'll find a way to nab him,
Josie, and skin him out of his last nickel!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>makes a threatening move toward him</i>) One more
word out of you--(<i>then contemptuously</i>) You're a dirty tick
and it'd serve you right if I let you stay gabbing until Father
came and beat you to a jelly, but I won't. I'm too anxious to be
rid of you. (<i>roughly</i>) Get out of here, now! Do you think
he'll stay all day with the pigs, you gabbing fool? (<i>She goes
left to peer around the corner of the house--with real alarm</i>)
There he is, coming up to the barn. (<i>Mike grabs the satchel,
terrified. He slinks swiftly around the corner and disappears
along the path to the woods, right-rear. She keeps watching her
father and does not notice Mike's departure.</i>) He's looking
toward the meadow. He sees you're not working. He's running down
there. He'll come here next. You'd better run for your life!
(<i>She turns and sees he's gone--contemptuously</i>) I might
have known. I'll bet you're a mile away by now, you rabbit!
(<i>She peeks around the corner again--with amused
admiration</i>) Look at my poor old father pelt. He's as spry on
his stumpy legs as a yearling--and as full of rage as a nest of
wasps! (<i>She laughs and comes back to look along the path to
the woods.</i>) Well, that's the last of you, Mike, and good
riddance. It was the little boy you used to be that I had to
mother, and not you, I stole the money for. (<i>This dismisses
him. She sighs.</i>) Well, himself will be here in a minute. I'd
better be ready. (<i>She reaches in her bedroom corner by the
door and takes out a sawed-off broom handle.</i>) Not that I need
it, but it saves his pride. (<i>She sits on the steps with the
broom handle propped against the steps near her right hand. A
moment later, her father, Phil Hogan, comes running up from
left-rear and charges around the corner of the house, his</i>
<i>arms pumping up and down, his fists clenched, his face full of
fighting fury.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Hogan is fifty-five, about five feet six. He has a thick
neck, lumpy, sloping shoulders, a barrel-like trunk, stumpy legs,
and big feet. His arms are short and muscular, with large hairy
hands. His head is round with thinning sandy hair. His face is
fat with a snub nose, long upper lip, big mouth, and little blue
eyes with bleached lashes and eyebrows that remind one of a white
pig's. He wears heavy brogans, filthy overalls, and a dirty
short-sleeved undershirt. Arms and face are sunburned and
freckled. On his head is an old wide-brimmed hat of coarse straw
that would look more becoming on a horse. His voice is
high-pitched with a pronounced brogue.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>stops as he turns the corner and sees
her--furiously</i>) Where is he? Is he hiding in the house? I'll
wipe the floors with him, the lazy bastard! (<i>turning his anger
against her</i>) Haven't you a tongue in your head, you great
slut you?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with provoking calm</i>) Don't be calling me names,
you bad-tempered old hornet, or maybe I'll lose my temper,
too.</p>

<p>HOGAN--To hell with your temper, you overgrown cow!</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'd rather be a cow than an ugly little buck goat.
You'd better sit down and cool off. Old men shouldn't run around
raging in the noon sun. You'll get sunstroke.</p>

<p>HOGAN--To hell with sunstroke! Have you seen him?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Have I seen who?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Mike! Who else would I be after, the Pope? He was in
the meadow, but the minute I turned my back he sneaked off.
(<i>He sees the pitchfork.</i>) There's his pitchfork! Will you
stop your lying!</p>

<p>JOSIE--I haven't said I didn't see him.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Then don't try to help him hide from me, or--Where is
he?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Where you'll never find him.</p>

<p>HOGAN--We'll soon see! I'll bet he's in your room under the
bed, the cowardly lump! (<i>He moves toward the steps.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--He's not. He's gone like Thomas and John before him to
escape your slave-driving.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>stares at her incredulously</i>) You mean he's run
off to make his own way in the world?</p>

<p>JOSIE--He has. So make up your mind to it, and sit down.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>baffled, sits on the boulder and takes off his hat
to scratch his head--with a faint trace of grudging respect</i>)
I'd never dream he had that much spunk. (<i>his temper rising
again</i>) And I know damned well he hadn't, not without you to
give him the guts and help him, like the great soft fool you
are!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Now don't start raging again, Father.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>seething</i>) You've stolen my satchel to give him,
I suppose, like you did before for Thomas and John?</p>

<p>JOSIE--It was my satchel, too. Didn't I help you in the trade
for the horse, when you got the Crowleys to throw in the satchel
for good measure? I was up all night fixing that nag's forelegs
so his knees wouldn't buckle together till after the Crowleys had
him a day or two.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>forgets his anger to grin reminiscently</i>) You've
a wonderful way with animals, God bless you. And do you remember
the two Crowleys came back to give me a beating, and I licked
them both?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with calculating flattery</i>) You did. You're a
wonderful fighter. Sure, you could give Jack Dempsey himself a
run for his money.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>with sharp suspicion</i>) I could, but don't try to
change the subject and fill me with blarney.</p>

<p>JOSIE--All right. I'll tell the truth then. They were getting
the best of you till I ran out and knocked one of them tail over
tin cup against the pigpen.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>outraged</i>) You're a liar! They was begging for
mercy before you came. (<i>furiously</i>) You thief, you! You
stole my fine satchel for that lump! And I'll bet that's not all.
I'll bet, like when Thomas and John sneaked off, you--(<i>He
rises from the boulder threateningly.</i>) Listen, Josie, if you
found where I hid my little green bag, and stole my money to give
to that lousy altar boy, I'll--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>rises from the steps with the broom handle in her
right hand</i>) Well, I did. So now what'll you do? Don't be
threatening me. You know I'll beat better sense in your skull if
you lay a finger on me.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I never yet laid hands on a woman--not when I was
sober--but if it wasn't for that club--(<i>bitterly</i>) A fine
curse God put on me when he gave me a daughter as big and strong
as a bull, and as vicious and disrespectful. (<i>Suddenly his
eyes twinkle and he grins admiringly.</i>) Be God, look at you
standing there with the club! If you ain't the damnedest daughter
in Connecticut, who is? (<i>He chuckles and sits on the boulder
again.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>laughs and sits on the steps, putting the club
away</i>) And if you ain't the damnedest father in Connecticut,
who is?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>takes a clay pipe and plug of tobacco and knife
from his pocket. He cuts the plug and stuffs his pipe--without
rancor</i>) How much did you steal, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Six dollars only.</p>

<p>HOGAN--<i>Only!</i> Well, God grant someone with wits will see
that dopey gander at the depot and sell him the railroad for the
six. (<i>grumbling</i>) It isn't the money I mind, Josie--</p>

<p>JOSIE--I know. Sure, what do you care for money? You'd give
your last penny to the first beggar you met--if he had a shotgun
pointed at your heart!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Don't be teasing. You know what I mean. It's the
thought of that pious lump having my money that maddens me. I
wouldn't put it past him to drop it in the collection plate next
Sunday, he's that big a jackass.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I knew when you'd calmed down you'd think it worth six
dollars to see the last of him.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>finishes filling his pipe</i>) Well, maybe I do. To
tell the truth, I never liked him. (<i>He strikes a match on the
seat of his overalls and lights his pipe.</i>) And I never liked
Thomas and John, either.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>amused</i>) You've the same bad luck in sons I have
in brothers.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>puffs ruminatively</i>) They all take after your
mother's family. She was the only one in it had spirit, God rest
her soul. The rest of them was a pious lousy lot. They wouldn't
dare put food in their mouths before they said grace for it. They
was too busy preaching temperance to have time for a drink. They
spent so much time confessing their sins, they had no chance to
do any sinning. (<i>He spits disgustedly.</i>) The scum of the
earth! Thank God, you're like me and your mother.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I don't know if I should thank God for being like you.
Sure, everyone says you're a wicked old tick, as crooked as a
corkscrew.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I know. They're an envious lot, God forgive them.
(<i>They both chuckle. He pulls on his pipe reflectively.</i>)
You didn't get much thanks from Mike, I'll wager, for your
help.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Oh, he thanked me kindly. And then he started to preach
about my sins--and yours.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Oho, did he? (<i>exploding</i>) For the love of God,
why didn't you hold him till I could give him one good kick for a
father's parting blessing!</p>

<p>JOSIE--I near gave him one myself.</p>

<p>HOGAN--When I think your poor mother was killed bringing that
crummy calf into life! (<i>vindictively</i>) I've never set foot
in a church since, and never will. (<i>A pause. He speaks with a
surprising sad gentleness.</i>) A sweet woman. Do you remember
her, Josie? You were only a little thing when she died.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I remember her well. (<i>with a, teasing smile which is
half sad</i>) She was the one could put you in your place when
you'd come home drunk and want to tear down the house for the fun
of it.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>with admiring appreciation</i>) Yes, she could do
it, God bless her. I only raised my hand to her once--just a slap
because she told me to stop singing, it was after daylight. The
next moment I was on the floor thinking a mule had kicked me.
(<i>He chuckles.</i>) Since you've grown up, I've had the same
trouble. There's no liberty in my own home.</p>

<p>JOSIE--That's lucky--or there wouldn't be any home.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>after a pause of puffing on his pipe</i>) What did
that donkey, Mike, preach to you about?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Oh, the same as ever--that I'm the scandal of the
countryside, carrying on with men without a marriage license.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>gives her a strange, embarrassed glance and then
looks away. He does not look at her during the following
dialogue. His manner is casual.</i>) Hell roast his soul for
saying it. But it's true enough.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>defiantly</i>) It is, and what of it? I don't care
a damn for the scandal.</p>

<p>HOGAN--No. You do as you please and to hell with everyone.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Yes, and that goes for you, too, if you are my father.
So don't you start preaching too.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Me, preach? Sure, the divil would die laughing. Don't
bring me into it. I learned long since to let you go your own way
because there's no controlling you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I do my work and I earn my keep and I've a right to be
free.</p>

<p>HOGAN--You have. I've never denied it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--No. You've never. I've often wondered why a man that
likes fights as much as you didn't grab at the excuse of my
disgrace to beat the lights out of the men.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Wouldn't I look a great fool, when everyone knows any
man who tried to make free with you, and you not willing, would
be carried off to the hospital? Anyway, I wouldn't want to fight
an army. You've had too many sweethearts.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with a proud toss of her head--boastfully</i>)
That's because I soon get tired of any man and give him his
walking papers.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I'm afraid you were born to be a terrible wanton woman.
But to tell the truth, I'm well satisfied you're what you are,
though I shouldn't say it, because if you was the decent kind,
you'd have married some fool long ago, and I'd have lost your
company and your help on the farm.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with a trace of bitterness</i>) Leave it to you to
think of your own interest.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>puffs on his pipe</i>) What else did my beautiful
son, Mike, say to you?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Oh, he was full of stupid gab, as usual. He gave me
good advice--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>grimly</i>) That was kind of him. It must have been
good--</p>

<p>JOSIE--I ought to marry and settle down--if I could find a
decent man who'd have me, which he was sure I couldn't.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>beginning to boil</i>) I tell you, Josie, it's
going to be the saddest memory of my life I didn't get one last
swipe at him!</p>

<p>JOSIE--So the only hope, he thought, was for me to catch some
indecent man, who'd have money coming to him I could steal.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>gives her a quick, probing side
glance--casually</i>) He meant Jim Tyrone?</p>

<p>JOSIE--He did. And the dirty tick accused you and me of making
up a foxy scheme to trap Jim. I'm to get him alone when he's
crazy drunk and lead him on to marry me. (<i>She adds in a hard,
scornful tone</i>) As if that would ever work. Sure, all the
pretty little tarts on Broadway, New York, must have had a try at
that, and much good it did them.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>again with a quick side glance--casually</i>) They
must have, surely. But that's in the city where he's suspicious.
You never can tell what he mightn't do here in the country, where
he's innocent, with a moon in the sky to fill him with poetry and
a quart of bad hootch inside of him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>turns on him angrily</i>) Are you taking Mike's
scheme seriously, you old goat?</p>

<p>HOGAN--I'm not. I only thought you wanted my opinion. (<i>She
regards him suspiciously, but his face is blank, as if he hadn't
a thought beyond enjoying his pipe.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>turning away</i>) And if that didn't work, Mike
said maybe we had a scheme that I'd get Jim in bed with me and
you'd come with witnesses and a shotgun, and catch him there.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Faith, me darlin' son never learnt that from his prayer
book! He must have improved his mind on the sly.</p>

<p>JOSIE--The dirty tick!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Don't call him a tick. I don't like ticks but I'll say
this for them, I never picked one off me yet was a hypocrite.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Him daring to accuse us of planning a rotten trick like
that on Jim!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>as if he misunderstood her meaning</i>) Yes, it's
as old as the hills. Everyone's heard of it. But it still works
now and again, I'm told, and sometimes an old trick is best
because it's so ancient no one would suspect you'd try it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>staring at him resentfully</i>) That's enough out
of you, Father. I never can tell to this day, when you put that
dead mug on you, whether you're joking or not, but I don't want
to hear any more--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>mildly</i>) I thought you wanted my honest opinion
on the merits of Mike's suggestion.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Och, shut up, will you? I know you're only trying to
make game of me. You like Jim and you'd never play a dirty trick
on him, not even if I was willing.</p>

<p>HOGAN--No--not unless I found he was playing one on me.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Which he'd never.</p>

<p>HOGAN--No, I wouldn't think it, but my motto in life is never
trust anyone too far, not even myself.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You've reason for the last. I've often suspected you
sneak out of bed in the night to pick your own pockets.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I wouldn't call it a dirty trick on him to get you for
a wife.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>exasperatedly</i>) God save us, are you off on that
again?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Well, you've put marriage in my head and I can't help
considering the merits of the case, as they say. Sure, you're two
of a kind, both great disgraces. That would help make a happy
marriage because neither of you could look down on the other.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Jim mightn't think so.</p>

<p>HOGAN--You mean he'd think he was marrying beneath his
station? He'd be a damned fool if he had that notion, for his Old
Man who'd worked up from nothing to be rich and famous didn't
give a damn about station. Didn't I often see him working on his
grounds in clothes I wouldn't put on a scarecrow, not caring who
saw him? (<i>with admiring affection</i>) God rest him, he was a
true Irish gentleman.</p>

<p>JOSIE--He was, and didn't you swindle him, and make me help
you at it? I remember when I was a slip of a girl, and you'd get
a letter saying his agent told him you were a year behind in the
rent, and he'd be damned if he'd stand for it, and he was coming
here to settle the matter. You'd make me dress up, with my hair
brushed and a ribbon in it, and leave me to soften his heart
before he saw you. So I'd skip down the path to meet him, and
make him a courtesy, and hold on to his hand, and bat my eyes at
him and lead him in the house, and offer him a drink of the good
whiskey you didn't keep for company, and gape at him and tell him
he was the handsomest man in the world, and the fierce expression
he'd put on for you would go away.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>chuckles</i>) You did it wonderful. You should have
gone on the stage.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>dryly</i>) Yes, that's what he'd tell me, and he'd
reach in his pocket and take out a half dollar, and ask me if you
hadn't put me up to it. So I'd say yes, you had.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>sadly</i>) I never knew you were such a black
traitor, and you only a child.</p>

<p>JOSIE--And then you'd come and before he could get a word out
of him, you'd tell him you'd vacate the premises unless he
lowered the rent and painted the house.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Be God, that used to stop him in his tracks.</p>

<p>JOSIE--It didn't stop him from saying you were the damnedest
crook ever came out of Ireland.</p>

<p>HOGAN--He said it with admiration. And we'd start drinking and
telling stories, and singing songs, and by the time he left we
were both too busy cursing England to worry over the rent. (<i>He
grins affectionately.</i>) Oh, he was a great man entirely.</p>

<p>JOSIE--He was. He always saw through your tricks.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Didn't I know he would? Sure, all I wanted was to give
him the fun of seeing through them so he couldn't be
hard-hearted. That was the real trick.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stares at him</i>) You old divil, you've always a
trick hidden behind your tricks, so no one can tell at times what
you're after.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Don't be so suspicious. Sure, I'd never try to fool
you. You know me too well. But we've gone off the track. It's Jim
we're discussing, not his father. I was telling you I could see
the merit in your marrying him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>exasperatedly</i>) Och, a cow must have kicked you
in the head this morning.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I'd never give it a thought if I didn't know you had a
soft spot in your heart for him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>resentfully</i>) Well, I haven't! I like him, if
that's what you mean, but it's only to talk to, because he's
educated and quiet-spoken and has politeness even when he's
drunkest, and doesn't roar around cursing and singing, like some
I could name.</p>

<p>HOGAN--If you could see the light in your eyes when he
blarneys you--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>roughly</i>) The light in me foot!
(<i>scornfully</i>) I'm in love with him, you'll be saying
next!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>ignores this</i>) And another merit of the case is,
he likes you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Because he keeps dropping in here lately? Sure, it's
only when he gets sick of the drunks at the Inn, and it's more to
joke with you than see me.</p>

<p>HOGAN--It's your happiness I'm considering when I recommend
your using your wits to catch him, if you can.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>jeeringly</i>) If!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Who knows? With all the sweethearts you've had, you
must have a catching way with men.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>boastfully</i>) Maybe I have. But that doesn't
mean--</p>

<p>HOGAN--If you got him alone tonight--there'll be a beautiful
moon to fill him with poetry and loneliness, and--</p>

<p>JOSIE--That's one of Mike's dirty schemes.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Mike be damned! Sure, that's every woman's scheme since
the world was created. Without it there'd be no population.
(<i>persuasively</i>) There'd be no harm trying it, anyway.</p>

<p>JOSIE--And no use, either. (<i>bitterly</i>) Och, Father,
don't play the jackass with me. You know, and I know, I'm an ugly
overgrown lump of a woman, and the men that want me are no better
than stupid bulls. Jim can have all the pretty, painted little
Broadway girls he wants--and dancers on the stage, too--when he
comes into his estate. That's the kind he likes.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I notice he's never married one. Maybe he'd like a fine
strong handsome figure of a woman for a change, with beautiful
eyes and hair and teeth and a smile.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>pleased, but jeering</i>) Thank you kindly for your
compliments. Now I know a cow kicked you in the head.</p>

<p>HOGAN--If you think Jim hasn't been taking in your fine
points, you're a fool.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You mean you've noticed him? (<i>suddenly furious</i>)
Stop your lying!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Don't fly in a temper. All I'm saying is, there may be
a chance in it to better yourself.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>scornfully</i>) Better myself by being tied down to
a man who's drunk every night of his life? No, thank you!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Sure, you're strong enough to reform him. A taste of
that club you've got, when he came home to you paralyzed, and in
a few weeks you'd have him a dirty prohibitionist.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>seriously</i>) It's true, if I was his wife, I'd
cure him of drinking himself to death, if I had to kill him.
(<i>then angrily</i>) Och, I'm sick of your crazy gab, Father!
Leave me alone!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Well, let's put it another way. Don't tell me you
couldn't learn to love the estate he'll come into.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>resentfully</i>) Ah, I've been waiting for that.
That's what Mike said, again. Now we've come to the truth behind
all your blather of my liking him or him liking me. (<i>her
manner changing--defiantly</i>) All right, then. Of course I'd
love the money. Who wouldn't? And why shouldn't I get my hands on
it, if I could? He's bound to be swindled out of it, anyway.
He'll go back to the Broadway he thinks is heaven, and by the
time the pretty little tarts, and the barroom sponges and
racetrack touts and gamblers are through with him he'll be picked
clean. I'm no saint, God knows, but I'm decent and deserving
compared to those scum.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>eagerly</i>) Be God, now you're using your wits.
And where there's a will there's a way. You and me have never
been beat when we put our brains together. I'll keep thinking it
over, and you do the same.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with illogical anger</i>) Well, I won't! And you
keep your mad scheming to yourself. I won't listen to it.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>as if he were angry, too</i>) All right. The divil
take you. It's all you'll hear from me. (<i>He pauses--then with
great seriousness, turning toward her</i>) Except one
thing--(<i>as she starts to shut him up--sharply</i>) I'm
serious, and you'd better listen, because it's about this farm,
which is home to us.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>surprised, stares at him</i>) What about the
farm?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Don't forget, if we have lived on it twenty years,
we're only tenants and we could be thrown out on our necks any
time. (<i>quickly</i>) Mind you, I don't say Jim would ever do
it, rent or no rent, or let the executors do it, even if they
wanted, which they don't, knowing they'd never find another
tenant.</p>

<p>JOSIE--What's worrying you, then?</p>

<p>HOGAN--This. I've been afraid lately the minute the estate is
out of probate, Jim will sell the farm.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>exasperatedly</i>) Of course he will! Hasn't he
told us and promised you can buy it on easy time payments at the
small price you offered?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Jim promises whatever you like when he's full of
whiskey. He might forget a promise as easy when he's drunk
enough.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>indignantly</i>) He'd never! And who'd want it
except us? No one ever has in all the years--</p>

<p>HOGAN--Someone has lately. The agent got an offer last month,
Jim told me, bigger than mine.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Och, Jim loves to try and get your goat. He was kidding
you.</p>

<p>HOGAN--He wasn't. I can tell. He said he told the agent to
tell whoever it was the place wasn't for sale.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Of course he did. Did he say who'd made the offer?</p>

<p>HOGAN--He didn't know. It came through a real-estate man who
wouldn't tell who his client was. I've been trying to guess, but
I can't think of anyone crazy enough unless it'd be some damn
fool of a millionaire buying up land to make a great estate for
himself, like our beautiful neighbor, Harder, the Standard Oil
thief, did years ago. (<i>He adds with bitter fervency</i>) May
he roast in hell and his Limey superintendent with him!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Amen to that. (<i>then scornfully</i>) This land for an
estate? And if there was an offer, Jim's refused it, and that
ends it. He wouldn't listen to any offer, after he's given his
word to us.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Did I say he would--when he's in his right mind? What
I'm afraid of is, he might be led into it sometime when he has
one of his sneering bitter drunks on and talks like a Broadway
crook himself, saying money is the only thing in the world, and
everything and anyone can be bought if the price is big enough.
You've heard him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I have. But he doesn't fool me at all. He only acts
like he's hard and shameless to get back at life when it's
tormenting him--and who doesn't? (<i>He gives her a quick,
curious side glance which she doesn't notice.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--Or take the other kind of queer drunk he gets on
sometimes when, without any reason you can see, he'll suddenly
turn strange, and look sad, and stare at nothing as if he was
mourning over some ghost inside him, and--</p>

<p>JOSIE--I think I know what comes over him when he's like that.
It's the memory of his mother comes back and his grief for her
death. (<i>pityingly</i>) Poor Jim.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>ignoring this</i>) And whiskey seems to have no
effect on him, like water off a duck's back. He'll keep acting
natural enough, and you'd swear he wasn't bad at all, but the
next day you find his brain was so paralyzed he don't remember a
thing until you remind him. He's done a lot of mad things, when
he was that way, he was sorry for after.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>scornfully</i>) What drunk hasn't? But he'd
never--(<i>resentfully</i>) I won't have you suspecting Jim
without any cause, d'you hear me!</p>

<p>HOGAN--I don't suspect him. All I've said is, when a man gets
as queer drunk as Jim, he doesn't know himself what he mightn't
do, and we'd be damned fools if we didn't fear the possibility,
however small it is, and do all we can to guard against it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--There's no possibility! And how could we guard against
it, if there was?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Well, you can put yourself out to be extra nice to him,
for one thing.</p>

<p>JOSIE--How nice is extra nice?</p>

<p>HOGAN--You ought to know. But here's one tip. I've noticed
when you talk rough and brazen like you do to other men, he may
grin like they do, as if he enjoyed it, but he don't. So watch
your tongue.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with a defiant toss of her head</i>) I'll talk as I
please, and if he don't like it he can lump it!
(<i>scornfully</i>) I'm to pretend I'm a pure virgin, I suppose?
That would fool him, wouldn't it, and him hearing all about me
from the men at the Inn? (<i>She gets to her feet, abruptly
changing the subject.</i>) We're wasting the day, blathering.
(<i>then her face hardening</i>) If he ever went back on his
word, no matter how drunk he was, I'd be with you in any scheme
you made against him, no matter how dirty. (<i>hastily</i>) But
it's all your nonsense. I'd never believe it. (<i>She comes and
picks up the pitchfork.</i>) I'll go to the meadow and finish
Mike's work. You needn't fear you'll miss his help on the
farm.</p>

<p>HOGAN--A hell of a help! A weak lazy back and the appetite of
a drove of starving pigs! (<i>as she turns to go--suddenly
bellicose</i>) Leaving me, are you? When it's dinner time?
Where's my dinner, you lazy cow?</p>

<p>JOSIE--There's stew on the stove, you bad-tempered runt. Go in
and help yourself. I'm not hungry. Your gab has bothered my mind.
I need hard work in the sun to clear it. (<i>She starts to go off
toward rear-right.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>glancing down the road, off left-front</i>) You'd
better wait. There's a caller coming to the gate--and if I'm not
mistaken, it's the light of your eyes himself.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>angrily</i>) Shut up! (<i>She stares off--her face
softens and grows pitying.</i>) Look at him when he thinks no one
is watching, with his eyes on the ground. Like a dead man walking
slow behind his own coffin. (<i>then roughly</i>) Faith, he must
have a hangover. He sees us now. Look at the bluff he puts up,
straightening himself and grinning. (<i>resentfully</i>) I don't
want to meet him. Let him make jokes with you and play the old
game about a drink you both think is such fun. That's all he
comes for, anyway. (<i>She starts off again.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--Are you running away from him? Sure, you must be afraid
you're in love. (<i>Josie halts instantly and turns back
defiantly. He goes on.</i>) Go in the house now, and wash your
face, and tidy your dress, and give a touch to your hair. You
want to look decent for him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>angrily</i>) I'll go in the house, but only to see
the stew ain't burned, for I suppose you'll have the foxiness to
ask him to have a bite to eat to keep in his good graces.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Why shouldn't I ask him? I know damned well he has no
appetite this early in the day, but only a thirst.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Och, you make me sick, you sly miser! (<i>She goes in
through her bedroom, slamming the door behind her. Hogan refills
his pipe, pretending he doesn't notice Tyrone approaching, his
eyes bright with droll expectation. Jim Tyrone enters along the
road from the highway, left.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Tyrone is in his early forties, around five feet nine,
broad-shouldered and deep-chested. His naturally fine physique
has become soft</i> <i>and soggy from dissipation, but his face
is still good-looking despite its unhealthy puffiness and the
bags under the eyes. He has thinning dark hair, parted and
brushed back to cover a bald spot. His eyes are brown, the whites
congested and yellowish. His nose, big and aquiline, gives his
face a certain Mephistophelian quality which is accentuated by
his habitually cynical expression. But when he smiles without
sneering, he still has the ghost of a former youthful,
irresponsible Irish charm--that of the beguiling ne'er-do-well,
sentimental and romantic. It is his humor and charm which have
kept him attractive to women, and popular with men as a drinking
companion. He is dressed in an expensive dark-brown suit,
tight-fitting and drawn in at the waist, dark-brown made-to-order
shoes and silk socks, a white silk shirt, silk handkerchief in
breast pocket, a dark tie. This get-up suggests that he follows a
style set by well-groomed Broadway gamblers who would like to be
mistaken for Wall Street brokers.</i></p>

<p>(<i>He has had enough pick-me-ups to recover from
morning-after nausea and steady his nerves. During the following
dialogue, he and Hogan are like players at an old familiar game
where each knows the other's moves, but which still amuses
them.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>approaches and stands regarding Hogan with
sardonic relish. Hogan scratches a match on the seat of his
overalls and lights his pipe, pretending not to see him. Tyrone
recites with feeling</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Fortunate senex, ergo tua rura manebunt,<br>
 et tibi magna satis, quamvis lapis omnia nudus."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>mutters</i>) It's the landlord again, and my
shotgun not handy. (<i>He looks up at Tyrone.</i>) Is it Mass
you're saying, Jim? That was Latin. I know it by ear. What the
hell--insult does it mean?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Translated very freely into Irish English, something
like this. (<i>He imitates Hogan's brogue.</i>) "Ain't you the
lucky old bastard to have this beautiful farm, if it is full of
nude rocks."</p>

<p>HOGAN--I like that part about the rocks. If cows could eat
them this place would make a grand dairy farm. (<i>He spits.</i>)
It's easy to see you've a fine college education. It must be a
big help to you, conversing with whores and barkeeps.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Yes, a very valuable worldly asset. I was once offered
a job as office boy--until they discovered I wasn't qualified
because I had no Bachelor of Arts diploma. There had been a
slight misunderstanding just before I was to graduate.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Between you and the Fathers? I'll wager!</p>

<p>TYRONE--I made a bet with another Senior I could get a tart
from the Haymarket to visit me, introduce her to the Jebs as my
sister--and get away with it.</p>

<p>HOGAN--But you didn't?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Almost. It was a memorable day in the halls of
learning. All the students were wise and I had them rolling in
the aisles as I showed Sister around the grounds, accompanied by
one of the Jebs. He was a bit suspicious at first, but Dutch
Maisie--her professional name--had no make-up on, and was dressed
in black, and had eaten a pound of Sen-Sen to kill the gin on her
breath, and seemed such a devout girl that he forgot his
suspicions. (<i>He pauses.</i>) Yes, all would have been well,
but she was a mischievous minx, and had her own ideas of
improving on my joke. When she was saying goodbye to Father
Fuller, she added innocently: "Christ, Father, it's nice and
quiet out here away from the damned Sixth Avenue El. I wish to
hell I could stay here!" (<i>dryly</i>) But she didn't, and
neither did I.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>chuckles delightedly</i>) I'll bet you didn't! God
bless Dutch Maisie! I'd like to have known her.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>sits down on the steps--with a change of
manner</i>) Well, how's the Duke of Donegal this fine day?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Never better.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Slaving and toiling as usual, I see.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Hasn't a poor man a right to his noon rest without
being sneered at by his rich landlord?</p>

<p>TYRONE--"Rich" is good. I would be, if you'd pay up your back
rent.</p>

<p>HOGAN--You ought to pay me, instead, for occupying this
rockpile, miscalled a farm. (<i>his eyes twinkling</i>) But I
have fine reports to give you of a promising harvest. The
milkweed and the thistles is in thriving condition, and I never
saw the poison ivy so bounteous and beautiful. (<i>Tyrone laughs.
Without their noticing, Josie appears in the doorway behind
Tyrone. She has tidied up and arranged her hair. She smiles down
at Jim, her face softening, pleased to hear him laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--You win. Where did Josie go, Phil? I saw her
here--</p>

<p>HOGAN--She ran in the house to make herself beautiful for
you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>breaks in roughly</i>) You're a liar. (<i>to
Tyrone, her manner one of bold, free-and-easy familiarity</i>)
Hello, Jim.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>starts to stand up</i>) Hello, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>puts a hand on his shoulder and pushes him
down</i>) Don't get up. Sure, you know I'm no lady. (<i>She sits
on the top step--banteringly</i>) How's my fine Jim this
beautiful day? You don't look so bad. You must have stopped at
the Inn for an eye-opener--or ten of them.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I've felt worse. (<i>He looks up at her
sardonically.</i>) And how's my Virgin Queen of Ireland?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Yours, is it? Since when? And don't be miscalling me a
virgin. You'll ruin my reputation, if you spread that lie about
me. (<i>She laughs. Tyrone is staring at her. She goes on
quickly.</i>) How is it you're around so early? I thought you
never got up till afternoon.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Couldn't sleep. One of those heebie-jeebie nights when
the booze keeps you awake instead of--(<i>He catches her giving
him a pitying look--irritably</i>) But what of it!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Maybe you had no woman in bed with you, for a change.
It's a terrible thing to break the habit of years.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>shrugs his shoulders</i>) Maybe.</p>

<p>JOSIE--What's the matter with the tarts in town, they let you
do it? I'll bet the ones you know on Broadway, New York, wouldn't
neglect their business.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>pretends to yawn boredly</i>) Maybe not. (<i>then
irritably</i>) Cut out the kidding, Josie. It's too early.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>who has been taking everything in without seeming
to</i>) I told you not to annoy the gentleman with your rough
tongue.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Sure I thought I was doing my duty as hostess making
him feel at home.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>stares at her again</i>) Why all the interest
lately in the ladies of the profession, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Oh, I've been considering joining their union. It's
easier living than farming, I'm sure. (<i>then resentfully</i>)
You think I'd starve at it, don't you, because your fancy is for
dainty dolls of women? But other men like--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>with sudden revulsion</i>) For God's sake, cut out
that kind of talk, Josie! It sounds like hell.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stares at him startledly--then resentfully</i>) Oh,
it does, does it? (<i>forcing a scornful smile</i>) I'm shocking
you, I suppose? (<i>Hogan is watching them both, not missing
anything in their faces, while he seems intent on his
pipe.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>looking a bit sheepish and annoyed at himself for
his interest--shrugs his shoulders</i>) No. Hardly. Forget it.
(<i>He smiles kiddingly.</i>) Anyway, who told you I fall for the
dainty dolls? That's all a thing of the past. I like them tall
and strong and voluptuous, now, with beautiful big breasts.
(<i>She blushes and looks confused and is furious with herself
for doing so.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--There you are, Josie, darlin'. Sure he couldn't speak
fairer than that.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>recovers herself</i>) He couldn't, indeed. (<i>She
pats Tyrone's head--playfully</i>) You're a terrible blarneying
liar, Jim, but thank you just the same. (<i>Tyrone turns his
attention to Hogan. He winks at Josie and begins in an
exaggeratedly casual manner.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--I don't blame you, Mr. Hogan, for taking it easy on
such a blazing hot day.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>doesn't look at him. His eyes twinkle.</i>) Hot,
did you say? I find it cool, meself. Take off your coat if you're
hot, Mister Tyrone.</p>

<p>TYRONE--One of the most stifling days I've ever known. Isn't
it, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>smiling</i>) Terrible. I know you must be
perishing.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I wouldn't call it a damned bit stifling.</p>

<p>TYRONE--It parches the membranes in your throat.</p>

<p>HOGAN--The what? Never mind. I can't have them, for my throat
isn't parched at all. If yours is, Mister Tyrone, there's a well
full of water at the back.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Water? That's something people wash with, isn't it? I
mean, some people.</p>

<p>HOGAN--So I've heard. But, like you, I find it hard to
believe. It's a dirty habit. They must be foreigners.</p>

<p>TYRONE--As I was saying, my throat is parched after the long
dusty walk I took just for the pleasure of being your guest.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I don't remember inviting you, and the road is hard
macadam with divil a spec of dust, and it's less than a quarter
mile from the Inn here.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I didn't have a drink at the Inn. I was waiting until
I arrived here, knowing that you--</p>

<p>HOGAN--Knowing I'd what?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Your reputation as a generous host--</p>

<p>HOGAN--The world must be full of liars. So you didn't have a
drink at the Inn? Then it must be the air itself smells of
whiskey today, although I didn't notice it before you came.
You've gone on the water-wagon, I suppose? Well, that's fine, and
I ask pardon for misjudging you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I've wanted to go on the wagon for the past
twenty-five years, but the doctors have strictly forbidden it. It
would be fatal--with my weak heart.</p>

<p>HOGAN--So you've a weak heart? Well, well, and me thinking all
along it was your head. I'm glad you told me. I was just going to
offer you a drink, but whiskey is the worst thing--</p>

<p>TYRONE--The Docs say it's a matter of life and death. I must
have a stimulant--one big drink, at least, whenever I strain my
heart walking in the hot sun.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Walk back to the Inn, then, and give it a good strain,
so you can buy yourself two big drinks.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>laughing</i>) Ain't you the fools, playing that old
game between you, and both of you pleased as punch!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>gives up with a laugh</i>) Hasn't he ever been
known to loosen up, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--You ought to know. If you need a drink you'll have to
buy it from him or die of thirst.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Well, I'll bet this is one time he's going to
treat.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Be God, I'll take that bet!</p>

<p>TYRONE--After you've heard the news I've got for you, you'll
be so delighted you won't be able to drag out the old bottle
quick enough.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I'll have to be insanely delighted.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>full of curiosity</i>) Shut up, Father. What news,
Jim?</p>

<p>TYRONE--I have it off the grapevine that a certain exalted
personage will drop in on you before long.</p>

<p>HOGAN--It's the sheriff again. I know by the pleased look on
your mug.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Not this time. (<i>He pauses tantalizingly.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Bad luck to you, can't you tell us who?</p>

<p>TYRONE--A more eminent grafter than the
sheriff--(<i>sneeringly</i>) A leading aristocrat in our Land of
the Free and Get-Rich-Quick, whose boots are licked by one and
all--one of the Kings of our Republic by Divine Right of
Inherited Swag. In short, I refer to your good neighbor, T.
Stedman Harder, Standard Oil's sappiest child, whom I know you
both love so dearly. (<i>There is a pause after this
announcement. Hogan and Josie stiffen, and their eyes begin to
glitter. But they can't believe their luck at first.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>in an ominous whisper</i>) Did you say Harder is
coming to call on us, Jim?</p>

<p>JOSIE--It's too good to be true.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>watching them with amusement</i>) No kidding. The
great Mr. Harder intends to stop here on his way back to lunch
from a horseback ride.</p>

<p>JOSIE--How do you know?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Simpson told me. I ran into him at the Inn.</p>

<p>HOGAN--That English scum of a superintendent!</p>

<p>TYRONE--He was laughing himself sick. He said he suggested the
idea to Harder--told him you'd be overwhelmed with awe if he
deigned to interview you in person.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Overwhelmed isn't the word. Is it, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--It isn't indeed, Father.</p>

<p>TYRONE--For once in his life, Simpson is cheering for you. He
doesn't like his boss. In fact, he asked me to tell you he hopes
you kill him.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>disdainfully</i>) To hell with the Limey's good
wishes. I'd like both of them to call together.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Ah, well, we can't have everything. (<i>to Tyrone</i>)
What's the reason Mr. Harder decided to notice poor, humble scum
the like of us?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>grinning</i>) That's right, Josie. Be humble.
He'll expect you to know your place.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Will he now? Well, well. (<i>with a great happy
sigh</i>) This is going to be a beautiful day entirely.</p>

<p>JOSIE--But what's Harder's reason, Jim?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Well, it seems he has an ice pond on his estate.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Oho! So that's it!</p>

<p>TYRONE--Yes. That's it. Harder likes to keep up the good old
manorial customs. He clings to his ice pond. And your pigpen
isn't far from his ice pond.</p>

<p>HOGAN--A nice little stroll for the pigs, that's all.</p>

<p>TYRONE--And somehow Harder's fence in that vicinity has a
habit of breaking down.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Fences are queer things. You can't depend on them.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Simpson says he's had it repaired a dozen times, but
each time on the following night it gets broken down again.</p>

<p>JOSIE--What a strange thing! It must be the bad fairies. I
can't imagine who else could have done it. Can you, Father?</p>

<p>HOGAN--I can't, surely.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Well, Simpson can. He knows you did it and he told his
master so.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>disdainfully</i>) Master is the word. Sure, the
English can't live unless they have a lord's backside to kiss,
the dirty slaves.</p>

<p>TYRONE--The result of those breaks in the fence is that your
pigs stroll--as you so gracefully put it--stroll through to
wallow happily along the shores of the ice pond.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Well, why not? Sure, they're fine ambitious
American-born pigs and they don't miss any opportunities. They're
like Harder's father who made the money for him.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I agree, but for some strange reason Harder doesn't
look forward to the taste of pig in next summer's ice water.</p>

<p>HOGAN--He must be delicate. Remember he's delicate, Josie, and
leave your club in the house. (<i>He bursts into joyful menacing
laughter.</i>) Oh, be God and be Christ in the mountains! I've
pined to have a quiet word with Mr. Harder for years, watching
him ride past in his big shiny automobile with his snoot in the
air, and being tormented always by the complaints of his Limey
superintendent. Oh, won't I welcome him!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Won't <i>we,</i> you mean. Sure, I love him as much as
you.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I'd kiss you, Jim, for this beautiful news, if you
wasn't so damned ugly. Maybe Josie'll do it for me. She has a
stronger stomach.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I will! He's earned it. (<i>She pulls Tyrone's head
back and laughingly kisses him on the lip. Her expression
changes. She looks startled and confused, stirred and at the same
time frightened. She forces a scornful laugh.</i>) Och, there's
no spirit in you! It's like kissing a corpse.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>gives her a strange surprised look--mockingly</i>)
Yes? (<i>turning to Hogan</i>) Well, how about that drink, Phil?
I'll leave it to Josie if drinks aren't on the house.</p>

<p>HOGAN--<i>I</i> won't leave it to Josie. She's prejudiced,
being in love.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>angrily</i>) Shut up, you old liar! (<i>then
guiltily, forcing a laugh</i>) Don't talk nonsense to sneak out
of treating Jim.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>sighing</i>) All right, Josie. Go get the bottle
and one small glass, or he'll never stop nagging me. I can turn
my back, so the sight of him drinking free won't break my heart.
(<i>Josie gets up, laughing, and goes in the house. Hogan peers
at the road off left.</i>) On his way back to lunch, you said?
Then it's time--(<i>fervently</i>) O Holy Joseph, don't let the
bastard change his mind!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>beginning to have qualms</i>) Listen, Phil. Don't
get too enthusiastic. He has a big drag around here, and he'll
have you pinched, sure as hell, if you beat him up.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Och, I'm no fool. (<i>Josie comes out with a bottle and
a tumbler.</i>) Will you listen to this, Josie. He's warning me
not to give Harder a beating--as if I'd dirty my hands on the
scum.</p>

<p>JOSIE--As if we'd need to. Sure, all we want is a quiet chat
with him.</p>

<p>HOGAN--That's all. As neighbor to neighbor.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>hands Tyrone the bottle and tumbler</i>) Here you
are, Jim. Don't stint yourself.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>mournfully</i>) A fine daughter! I tell you a small
glass and you give him a bucket! (<i>As Tyrone pours a big drink,
grinning at him, he turns away with a comic shudder.</i>) That's
a fifty-dollar drink, at least.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Here's luck, Phil.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I hope you drown. (<i>Tyrone drinks and makes a wry
face.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--The best chicken medicine I've ever tasted.</p>

<p>HOGAN--That's gratitude for you! Here, pass me the bottle. A
drink will warm up my welcome for His Majesty. (<i>He takes an
enormous swig from the bottle.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>looking off left</i>) There's two horseback riders
on the county road now.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Praise be to God! It's him and a groom. (<i>He sets the
bottle on top of the boulder.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--That's McCabe. An old sweetheart of mine. (<i>She
glances at Tyrone provokingly--then suddenly worried and
protective</i>) You get in the house, Jim. If Harder sees you
here, he'll lay the whole blame on you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Nix, Josie. You don't think I'm going to miss this, do
you?</p>

<p>JOSIE--You can sit inside by my window and take in everything.
Come on, now, don't be stubborn with me. (<i>She puts her hands
under his arms and lifts him to his feet as easily as if he was a
child--banteringly</i>) Go into my beautiful bedroom. It's a nice
place for you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>kiddingly</i>) Just what I've been thinking for
some time, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>boldly</i>) Sure, you've never given me a sign of
it. Come up tonight and we'll spoon in the moonlight and you can
tell me your thoughts.</p>

<p>TYRONE--That's a date. Remember, now.</p>

<p>JOSIE--It's you who'll forget. Get inside now, before it's too
late. (<i>She gives him a shove inside and closes the
door.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>has been watching the visitor approach</i>) He's
dismounting--as graceful as a scarecrow, and his poor horse
longing to give him a kick. Look at Mac grinning at us. Sit down,
Josie. (<i>She sits on the steps, he on the boulder.</i>) Pretend
you don't notice him. (<i>T. Stedman Harder appears at left. They
act as if they didn't see him. Hogan knocks out his pipe on the
palm of his hand.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Harder is in his late thirties but looks younger because
his face is unmarked by worry, ambition, or any of the common
hazards of life. No matter how long he lives, his four
undergraduate years will always be for him the most significant
in his life, and the moment of his highest achievement the time
he was tapped for an exclusive Senior Society at the Ivy
university to which his father had given millions. Since that day
he has felt no need for further aspiring, no urge to do anything
except settle down on his estate and live the life of a country
gentleman, mildly interested in saddle horses and sport models of
foreign automobiles. He is not the blatantly silly, playboy heir
to millions whose antics make newspaper headlines. He doesn't
drink much except when he attends his class reunion every
spring--the most exciting episode of each year for him. He
doesn't give wild parties, doesn't chase after musical-comedy
cuties, is a mildly contented husband and father of three
children. A not unpleasant man, affable, good-looking in an
ordinary way, sunburnt and healthy, beginning to take on fat, he
is simply immature, naturally lethargic, a bit stupid. Coddled
from birth, everything arranged and made easy for him, deferred
to because of his wealth, he usually has the self-confident
attitude of acknowledged superiority, but assumes a supercilious,
insecure air when dealing with people beyond his ken. He is
dressed in a beautifully tailored English tweed coat and whipcord
riding breeches, immaculately polished English riding boots with
spurs, and carries a riding crop in his hand.</i></p>

<p>(<i>It would be hard to find anyone more ill-equipped for
combat with the Hogans. He has never come in contact with anyone
like them. To make matters easier for them he is deliberate in
his speech, slow on the uptake, and has no sense of humor. The
experienced strategy of the Hogans in verbal battle is to take
the offensive at once and never let an opponent get set to hit
back. Also, they use a beautifully co-ordinated, bewildering
change of pace, switching suddenly from jarring shouts to low,
confidential vituperation. And they exaggerate their Irish
brogues to confuse an enemy still further.</i>)</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>walks toward Hogan--stiffly</i>) Good morning. I
want to see the man who runs this farm.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>surveys him deliberately, his little pig eyes
gleaming with malice</i>) You do, do you? Well, you've seen him.
So run along now and play with your horse, and don't bother me.
(<i>He turns to Josie, who is staring at Harder, much to his
discomfiture, as if she had discovered a cockroach in her
soup.</i>) D'you see what I see, Josie? Be God, you'll have to
give that damned cat of yours a spanking for bringing it to our
doorstep.</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>determined to be authoritative and command
respect--curtly</i>) Are you Hogan?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>insultingly</i>) I am <i>Mister</i> Philip
Hogan--to a gentleman.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>glares at Harder</i>) Where's your manners, you
spindle-shanked jockey? Were you brought up in a stable?</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>does not fight with ladies, and especially not
with this lady--ignoring her</i>) My name is Harder. (<i>He
obviously expects them to be immediately impressed and
apologetic.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>contemptuously</i>) Who asked you your name, me
little man?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Sure, who in the world cares who the hell you are?</p>

<p>HOGAN--But if you want to play politeness, we'll play with
you. Let me introduce you to my daughter, Harder--Miss Josephine
Hogan.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>petulantly</i>) I don't want to meet him, Father. I
don't like his silly sheep's face, and I've no use for jockeys,
anyway. I'll wager he's no damned good to a woman. (<i>From
inside her bedroom comes a burst of laughter. This revelation of
an unseen audience startles Harder. He begins to look extremely
unsure of himself.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--I don't think he's a jockey. It's only the funny pants
he's wearing. I'll bet if you asked his horse, you'd find he's no
cowboy either. (<i>to Harder, jeeringly</i>) Come, tell us the
truth, me honey. Don't you kiss your horse each time you mount
and beg him, please don't throw me today, darlin', and I'll give
you an extra bucket of oats. (<i>He bursts into an extravagant
roar of laughter, slapping his thigh, and Josie guffaws with him,
while they watch the disconcerting effect of this theatrical
mirth on Harder.</i>)</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>beginning to lose his temper</i>) Listen to me,
Hogan! I didn't come here--(<i>He is going to add "to listen to
your damned jokes" or something like that, but Hogan silences
him.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>shouts</i>) What? What's that you said? (<i>He
stares at the dumbfounded Harder with droll amazement, as if he
couldn't believe his ears.</i>) You didn't come here? (<i>He
turns to Josie--in a whisper</i>) Did you hear that, Josie?
(<i>He takes off his hat and scratches his head in comic
bewilderment.</i>) Well, that's a puzzle, surely. How d'you
suppose he got here?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Maybe the stork brought him, bad luck to it for a dirty
bird. (<i>Again Tyrone's laughter is heard from the
bedroom.</i>)</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>so off balance now he can only repeat angrily</i>)
I said I didn't come here--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>shouts</i>) Wait! Wait, now! (<i>threateningly</i>)
We've had enough of that. Say it a third time and I'll send my
daughter to telephone the asylum.</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>forgetting he's a gentleman</i>) Damn you, I'm the
one who's had enough--!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>shouts</i>) Hold your dirty tongue! I'll have no
foul language in my presence.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Och, don't mind him, Josie. He's said he isn't here,
anyway, so we won't talk to him behind his back. (<i>He regards
Harder with pitying contempt.</i>) Sure, ain't you the poor crazy
creature? Do you want us to believe you're your own ghost?</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>notices the bottle on the boulder for the first
time--tries to be contemptuously tolerant and even to smile with
condescending disdain</i>) Ah! I understand now. You're drunk.
I'll come back sometime when you're sober--or send
Simpson--(<i>He turns away, glad of an excuse to escape.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>jumps up and advances on him menacingly</i>) No,
you don't! You'll apologize first for insulting a
lady--insinuating I'm drunk this early in the day--or I'll knock
some good breeding in you!</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>actually frightened now</i>) I--I said nothing
about you--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>gets up to come between them</i>) Aisy now, Josie.
He didn't mean it. He don't know what he means, the poor loon.
(<i>to Harder--pityingly</i>) Run home, that's a good lad, before
your keeper misses you.</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>hastily</i>) Good day. (<i>He turns eagerly toward
left but suddenly Hogan grabs his shoulder and spins him
around--then shifts his grip to the lapel of Harder's
coat.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>grimly</i>) Wait now, me Honey Boy. I'll have a
word with you, if you plaze. I'm beginning to read some sense
into this. You mentioned that English bastard, Simpson. I know
who you are now.</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>outraged</i>) Take your hands off me, you drunken
fool. (<i>He raises his riding crop.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>grabs it and tears it from his hand with one
powerful twist--fiercely</i>) Would you strike my poor infirm old
father, you coward, you!</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>calling for help</i>) McCabe!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Don't think McCabe will hear you, if you blew Gabriel's
horn. He knows I or Josie can lick him with one hand.
(<i>sharply</i>) Josie! Stand between us and the gate. (<i>Josie
takes her stand where the path meets the road. She turns her back
for a moment, shaking with suppressed laughter, and waves her
hand at McCabe and turns back. Hogan releases his hold on
Harder's coat.</i>) There now. Don't try running away or my
daughter will knock you senseless. (<i>He goes on grimly before
Harder can speak.</i>) You're the blackguard of a millionaire
that owns the estate next to ours, ain't you? I've been meaning
to call on you, for I've a bone to pick with you, you bloody
tyrant! But I couldn't bring myself to set foot on land bought
with Standard Oil money that was stolen from the poor it ground
in the dust beneath its dirty heel--land that's watered with the
tears of starving widows and orphans--(<i>He abruptly switches
from this eloquence to a matter-of-fact tone.</i>) But never mind
that, now. I won't waste words trying to reform a born crook.
(<i>fiercely, shoving his dirty unshaven face almost into
Harder's</i>) What I want to know is, what the hell d'you mean by
your contemptible trick of breaking down your fence to entice my
poor pigs to take their death in your ice pond? (<i>There is a
shout of laughter from Josie's bedroom, and Josie doubles up and
holds her sides. Harder is so flabbergasted by this mad
accusation he cannot even sputter. But Hogan acts as if he'd
denied it--savagely</i>) Don't lie, now! None of your damned
Standard Oil excuses, or be Jaysus, I'll break you in half!
Haven't I mended that fence morning after morning, and seen the
footprints where you had sneaked up in the night to pull it down
again. How many times have I mended that fence, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--If it's once, it's a hundred, Father.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Listen, me little millionaire! I'm a peaceful, mild man
that believes in live and let live, and as long as the
neighboring scum leave me alone, I'll let them alone, but when it
comes to standing by and seeing my poor pigs murthered one by
one--! Josie! How many pigs is it caught their death of cold in
his damned ice pond and died of pneumonia?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Ten of them, Father. And ten more died of cholera after
drinking the dirty water in it.</p>

<p>HOGAN--All prize pigs, too! I was offered two hundred dollars
apiece for them. Twenty pigs at two hundred, that's four
thousand. And a thousand to cure the sick and cover funeral
expenses for the dead. Call it four thousand you owe me.
(<i>furiously</i>) And you'll pay it, or I'll sue you, so help me
Christ! I'll drag you in every court in the land! I'll paste your
ugly mug on the front page of every newspaper as a pig-murdering
tyrant! Before I'm through with you, you'll think you're the King
of England at an Irish wake! (<i>with a quick change of pace to a
wheedling confidential tone</i>) Tell me now, if it isn't a
secret, whatever made you take such a savage grudge against pigs?
Sure, it isn't reasonable for a Standard Oil man to hate
hogs.</p>

<p>HARDER--(<i>manages to get in three sputtering words</i>) I've
had enough--!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>with a grin</i>) Be God, I believe you!
(<i>switching to fierceness and grabbing his lapel again</i>)
Look out, now! Keep your place and be soft-spoken to your
betters! You're not in your shiny automobile now with your funny
nose cocked so you won't smell the poor people. (<i>He gives him
a shake.</i>) And let me warn you! I have to put up with a lot of
pests on this heap of boulders some joker once called a farm.
There's a cruel skinflint of a landlord who swindles me out of my
last drop of whiskey, and there's poison ivy, and ticks and
potato bugs, and there's snakes and skunks! But, be God, I draw
the line somewhere, and I'll be damned if I'll stand for a
Standard Oil man trespassing! So will you kindly get the hell out
of here before I plant a kick on your backside that'll land you
in the Atlantic Ocean! (<i>He gives Harder a shove.</i>) Beat it
now! (<i>Harder tries to make some sort of disdainfully dignified
exit. But he has to get by Josie.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>leers at him idiotically</i>) Sure, you wouldn't go
without a word of good-bye to me, would you, darlin'? Don't scorn
me just because you have on your jockey's pants. (<i>in a</i>
<i>hoarse whisper</i>) Meet me tonight, as usual, down by the
pigpen. (<i>Harder's retreat becomes a rout. He disappears on
left, but a second later his voice, trembling with anger, is
heard calling back threateningly.</i>)</p>

<p>HARDER--If you dare touch that fence again, I'll put this
matter in the hands of the police!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>shouts derisively</i>) And I'll put it in my
lawyer's hands and in the newspapers! (<i>He doubles up with
glee.</i>) Look at him fling himself on his nag and spur the poor
beast! And look at McCabe behind him! He can hardly stay in the
saddle for laughing! (<i>He slaps his thigh.</i>) O Jaysus, this
is a great day for the poor and oppressed! I'll do no more work!
I'll go down to the Inn and spend money and get drunk as
Moses!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Small blame to you. You deserve it. But you'll have
your dinner first, to give you a foundation. Come on, now.
(<i>They turn back toward the house. From inside another burst of
laughter from Tyrone is heard. Josie smiles.</i>) Listen to Jim
still in stitches. It's good to hear him laugh as if he meant it.
(<i>Tyrone appears in the doorway of her bedroom.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--O God, my sides are sore. (<i>They all laugh together.
He joins them at the left corner of the house.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--It's dinner time. Will you have a bit to eat with us,
Jim? I'll boil you some eggs.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Och, why do you have to mention eggs? Don't you know
it's the one thing he might eat? Well, no matter. Anything goes
today. (<i>He gets the bottle of whiskey.</i>) Come in, Jim.
We'll have a drink while Josie's fixing the grub. (<i>They start
to go in the front door, Hogan in the lead.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>suddenly--with sardonic amusement</i>) Wait a
minute. Let us pause to take a look at this very valuable
property. Don't you notice the change, Phil? Every boulder on the
place has turned to solid gold.</p>

<p>HOGAN--What the hell--? You didn't get the D.T.'s from my
whiskey, I know that.</p>

<p>TYRONE--No D.T.'s about it. This farm has suddenly become a
gold mine. You know that offer I told you about? Well, the agent
did a little detective work and he discovered it came from
Harder. He doesn't want the damned place but he dislikes you as a
neighbor and he thinks the best way to get rid of you would be to
become your landlord.</p>

<p>HOGAN--The sneaking skunk! I'm sorry I didn't give him that
kick.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Yes. So am I. That would have made the place even more
valuable. But as it is, you did nobly. I expect him to double or
triple his first offer. In fact, I'll bet the sky is the limit
now.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>gives Josie a meaningful look</i>) I see your
point! But we're not worrying you'd ever forget your promise to
us for any price.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Promise? What promise? You know what Kipling wrote:
(<i>paraphrasing the "Rhyme of the Three Sealers"</i>) There's
never a promise of God or man goes north of ten thousand
bucks.</p>

<p>HOGAN--D'you hear him, Josie? We can't trust him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Och, you know he's kidding.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I don't! I'm becoming suspicious.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>a trace of bitterness beneath his amused tone</i>)
That's wise dope, Phil. Trust and be a sucker. If I were you, I'd
be seriously worried. I've always wanted to own a gold mine--so I
could sell it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>bursts out</i>) Will you shut up your rotten
Broadway blather!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>stares at her in surprise</i>) Why so serious and
indignant, Josie? You just told your unworthy Old Man I was
kidding. (<i>to Hogan</i>) At last, I've got you by the ears,
Phil. We must have a serious chat about when you're going to pay
that back rent.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>groans</i>) A landlord who's a blackmailer! Holy
God, what next! (<i>Josie is smiling with relief now.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--And you, Josie, please remember when I keep that
moonlight date tonight I expect you to be very sweet to me.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with a bold air</i>) Sure, you don't have to
blackmail me. I'd be that to you, anyway.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Are you laying plots in my presence to seduce my only
daughter? (<i>then philosophically</i>) Well, what can I do? I'll
be drunk at the Inn, so how could I prevent it? (<i>He goes up
the steps.</i>) Let's eat, for the love of God. I'm starving.
(<i>He disappears inside the house.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with an awkward playful gesture, takes Tyrone by
the hand</i>) Come along, Jim.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>smiles kiddingly</i>) Afraid you'll lose me? Swell
chance! (<i>His eyes fix on her breasts--with genuine
feeling</i>) You have the most beautiful breasts in the world, do
you know it, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>pleased--shyly</i>) I don't--but I'm happy if you
think--(<i>then quickly</i>) But I've no time now to listen to
your kidding, with my mad old father waiting for his dinner. So
come on. (<i>She tugs at his hand and he follows her up the
steps. Her manner changes to worried solicitude.</i>) Promise me
you'll eat something, Jim. You've got to eat. You can't go on the
way you are, drinking and never eating, hardly. You're killing
yourself.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>sardonically</i>) That's right. Mother me, Josie,
I love it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>bullyingly</i>) I will, then. You need one to take
care of you. (<i>They disappear inside the house.</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a02">ACT TWO</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The same, with the wall of the living room
removed.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a clear warm moonlight night, around eleven
o'clock.</i></p>

<p><i>Josie is sitting on the steps before the front door. She
has changed to her Sunday best, a cheap dark-blue dress, black
stockings and shoes. Her hair is carefully arranged, and by way
of adornment a white flower is pinned on her bosom. She is
hunched up, elbows on knees, her chin in her hands. There is an
expression on her face we have not seen before, a look of sadness
and loneliness and humiliation.</i></p>

<p><i>She sighs and gets slowly to her feet, her body stiff from
sitting long in the same position. She goes into the living room,
fumbles around for the box of matches, and lights a kerosene lamp
on the table.</i></p>

<p><i>The living room is small, low-ceilinged, with faded,
fly-specked wallpaper, a floor of bare boards. It is cluttered up
with furniture that looks as if it had been picked up at a fire
sale. There is a table at center, a disreputable old Morris chair
beside it; two ugly sideboards, one at left, the other at
right-rear; a porch rocking-chair, painted green, with a hole in
its cane bottom; a bureau against the rear wall, with two chairs
on either side of a door to the kitchen. On the bureau is an
alarm clock which shows the time to be five past eleven. At
right-front is the door to Josie's bedroom.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>looks at the clock--dully</i>) Five past eleven,
and he said he'd be here around nine. (<i>Suddenly in a burst of
humiliated anger, she tears off the flower pinned to her bosom
and throws it in the corner.</i>) To hell with you, Jim Tyrone!
(<i>From down the road, the quiet of the night is shattered by a
burst of melancholy song. It is unmistakably Hogan's voice
wailing an old Irish lament at the top of his lungs. Josie
starts--then frowns irritably.</i>) What's bringing him home an
hour before the Inn closes? He must be more paralyzed than ever
I've known him. (<i>She listens to the singing--grimly</i>) Ah,
here you come, do you, as full as a tick! I'll give you a
welcome, if you start cutting up! I'm in no mood to put up with
you. (<i>She goes into her bedroom and returns with her
broomstick club. Outside the singing grows louder as Hogan
approaches the house. He only remembers one verse of the song and
he has been repeating it.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh the praties they grow small<br>
 Over here, over here,<br>
 Oh, the praties they grow small<br>
 Over here.<br>
 Oh the praties they grow small<br>
 And we dig them in the fall<br>
 And we eat them skins and all<br>
 Over here, over here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>He enters left-front, weaving and lurching a bit. But he
is not as drunk as he appears. Or rather, he is one of those
people who can drink an enormous amount and be absolutely
plastered when they want to be for their own pleasure, but at the
same time are able to pull themselves together when they wish and
be cunningly clear-headed. Just now, he is letting himself go and
getting great satisfaction from it. He pauses and bellows
belligerently at the house</i>) Hurroo! Down with all tyrants,
male and female! To hell with England, and God damn Standard
Oil!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>shouts back</i>) Shut up your noise, you crazy old
billy goat!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>hurt and mournful</i>) A sweet daughter and a sweet
welcome home in the dead of night. (<i>beginning to boil</i>) Old
goat! There's respect for you! (<i>angrily--starting for the
front door</i>) Crazy billy goat, is it? Be God, I'll learn you
manners! (<i>He pounds on the door with his fist.</i>) Open the
door! Open this door, I'm saying, before I drive a fist through
it, or kick it into flinders! (<i>He gives it a kick.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--It's not locked, you drunken old loon! Open it
yourself!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>turns the knob and stamps in</i>) Drunken old loon,
am I? Is that the way to address your father?</p>

<p>JOSIE--No. It's too damned good for him.</p>

<p>HOGAN--It's time I taught you a lesson. Be Jaysus, I'll take
you over my knee and spank your tail, if you are as big as a cow!
(<i>He makes a lunge to grab her.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Would you, though! Take that, then! (<i>She raps him
smartly, but lightly, on his bald spot with the end of her broom
handle.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>with an exaggerated howl of pain</i>) Ow! (<i>His
anger evaporates and he rubs the top of his head ruefully--with
bitter complaint</i>) God forgive you, it's a great shame to me
I've raised a daughter so cowardly she has to use a club.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>puts her club on the table--grimly</i>) Now I've no
club.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>evades the challenge</i>) I never thought I'd see
the day when a daughter of mine would be such a coward as to
threaten her old father when he's helpless drunk and can't hit
back. (<i>He slumps down on the Morris chair.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Ah, that's better. Now that little game is over.
(<i>then angrily</i>) Listen to me, Father. I have no patience
left, so get up from that chair, and go in your room, and go to
bed, or I'll take you by the scruff of your neck and the seat of
your pants and throw you in and lock the door on you! I mean it,
now! (<i>on the verge of angry tears</i>) I've had all I can bear
this night, and I want some peace and sleep, and not to listen to
an old lush!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>appears drunker, his head wagging, his voice thick,
his talk rambling</i>) That's right. Fight with me. My own
daughter has no feelings or sympathy. As if I hadn't enough after
what's happened tonight.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with angry disgust</i>) Och, don't try--(<i>then
curiously</i>) What's happened? I thought something must be
queer, you coming home before the Inn closed, but then I thought
maybe for once you'd drunk all you could hold.
(<i>scathingly</i>) And, God pity you, if you ain't that full,
you're damned close to it.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Go on. Make fun of me. Old lush! You wouldn't feel so
comical, if--(<i>He stops, mumbling to himself.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--If what?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Never mind. Never mind. I didn't come home to fight,
but seek comfort in your company. And if I was singing coming
along the road, it was only because there's times you have to
sing to keep from crying.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I can see you crying!</p>

<p>HOGAN--You will. And you'll see yourself crying, too,
when--(<i>He stops again and mumbles to himself.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--When what? (<i>exasperatedly</i>) Will you stop your
whiskey drooling and talk plain?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>thickly</i>) No matter. No matter. Leave me
alone.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>angrily</i>) That's good advice. To hell with you!
I know your game. Nothing at all has happened. All you want is to
keep me up listening to your guff. Go to your room, I'm saying,
before--</p>

<p>HOGAN--I won't. I couldn't sleep with my thoughts tormented
the way they are. I'll stay here in this chair, and you go to
your room and let me be.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>snorts</i>) And have you singing again in a minute
and smashing the furniture--</p>

<p>HOGAN--Sing, is it? Are you making fun again? I'd give a keen
of sorrow or howl at the moon like an old mangy hound in his
sadness if I knew how, but I don't. So rest aisy. You won't hear
a sound from me. Go on and snore like a pig to your heart's
content. (<i>He mourns drunkenly</i>) A fine daughter! I'd get
more comfort from strangers.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Och, for God's sake, dry up! You'll sit in the dark
then. I won't leave the lamp lit for you to tip over and burn
down the house. (<i>She reaches out to turn down the
lamp.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>thickly</i>) Let it burn to the ground. A hell of a
lot I care if it burns.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>in the act of turning down the lamp, stops and
stares at him, puzzled and uneasy</i>) I never heard you talk
that way before, no matter how drunk you were. (<i>He mumbles.
Her tone becomes persuasive.</i>) What's happened to you,
Father?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>bitterly</i>) Ah it's "Father" now, is it, not old
billy goat? Well, thank God for small favors. (<i>with heavy
sarcasm</i>) Oh, nothing's happened to me at all, at all. A
trifle, only. I wouldn't waste your time mentioning it, or keep
you up when you want sleep so bad.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>angrily</i>) Och, you old loon, I'm sick of you.
Sleep it off till you get some sense. (<i>She reaches for the
lamp again.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--Sleep it off? We'll see if you'll sleep it off when you
know--(<i>He lapses into drunken mumbling.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>again stares at him</i>) Know what, Father?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>mumbles</i>) The son of a bitch!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>trying a light tone</i>) Sure, there's a lot of
those in the neighborhood. Which one do you mean? Is Harder on
your mind again?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>thickly</i>) He's one and a prize one, but I don't
mean him. I'll say this for Harder, you know what to expect from
him. He's no wolf in sheep's clothing, nor a treacherous snake in
the grass who stabs you in the back with a knife--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>apprehensive now--forces a joke</i>) Sure, if
you've found a snake who can stab you with a knife, you'd better
join the circus with him and make a pile of money.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>bitterly</i>) Make jokes, God forgive you! You'll
soon laugh from the wrong end of your mouth! (<i>He mumbles</i>)
Pretending he's our friend! The lying bastard!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>bristles resentfully</i>) Is it Jim Tyrone you're
calling hard names?</p>

<p>HOGAN--That's right. Defend him, you big soft fool! Faith,
you're a prize dunce! You've had a good taste of believing his
word, waiting hours for him dressed up in your best like a poor
sheep without pride or spirit--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stung</i>) Shut up! I was calling him a lying
bastard myself before you came, and saying I'd never speak to him
again. And I knew all along he'd never remember to keep his date
after he got drunk.</p>

<p>HOGAN--He's not so drunk he forgot to attend to business.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>as if she hadn't heard--defiantly</i>) I'd have
stayed up anyway a beautiful night like this to enjoy the
moonlight, if there wasn't a Jim Tyrone in the world.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>with heavy sarcasm</i>) In your best shoes and
stockings? Well, well. Sure, the moon must feel flattered by your
attentions.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>furiously</i>) You won't feel flattered if I knock
you tail over tincup out of that chair! And stop your whiskey
gabble about Jim. I see what you're driving at with your dark
hints and curses, and if you think I'll believe--(<i>with forced
assurance</i>) Sure, I know what's happened as well as if I'd
been there. Jim saw you'd got drunker than usual and you were an
easy mark for a joke, and he's made a goat of you!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>bitterly</i>) Goat, again! (<i>He struggles from
his chair and stands swaying unsteadily--with offended
dignity</i>) All right, I won't say another word. There's no use
telling the truth to a bad-tempered woman in love.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Love be damned! I hate him now!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Be Christ, you have me stumped. A great proud slut
who's played games with half the men around here, and now you act
like a numbskull virgin that can't believe a man would tell her a
lie!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>threateningly</i>) If you're going to your room,
you'd better go quick!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>fixes his eyes on the door at rear--with
dignity</i>) That's where I'm going, yes--to talk to meself so
I'll know someone with brains is listening. Good night to you,
Miss Hogan. (<i>He starts--swerves left--tries to correct this
and lurches right and bumps against her, clutching the supporting
arm she stretches out.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--God help you, if you try to go upstairs now, you'll end
up in the cellar.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>hanging on to her arm and shoulder--maudlinly
affectionate now</i>) You're right. Don't listen to me. I'm wrong
to bother you. You've had sorrow enough this night. Have a good
sleep, while you can, Josie, darlin'--and good night and God
bless you. (<i>He tries to kiss her, but she wards him off and
steers him back to the chair.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Sit down before you split in pieces on the floor and I
have to get the wheelbarrow to collect you. (<i>She dumps him in
the chair where he sprawls limply, his chin on his
chest.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>mumbles dully</i>) It's too late. It's all settled.
We're helpless, entirely.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>really worried now</i>) How is it all settled? If
you're helpless, I'm not. (<i>then as he doesn't
reply--scornfully</i>) It's the first time I ever heard you admit
you were licked. And it's the first time I ever saw you so
paralyzed you couldn't shake the whiskey from your brains and get
your head clear when you wanted. Sure, that's always been your
pride--and now look at you, the stupid object you are, mumbling
and drooling!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>struggles up in his chair--angrily</i>) Shut up
your insults! Be God, I can get my head clear if I like! (<i>He
shakes his head violently.</i>) There! It's clear. I can tell you
each thing that happened tonight as clear as if I'd not taken a
drop, if you'll listen and not keep calling me a liar.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'll listen, now I see you have hold of your wits.</p>

<p>HOGAN--All right, then. I'll begin at the beginning when him
and me left here, and you gave him a sweet smile, and rolled your
big beautiful cow's eyes at him, and wiggled your backside, and
stuck out your beautiful breasts you know he admires, and said in
a sick sheep's voice: "Don't forget our moonlight date, Jim."</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with suppressed fury</i>) You're a--! I never--!
You old--!</p>

<p>HOGAN--And he said: "You bet I won't forget, Josie."</p>

<p>JOSIE--The lying crook!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>His voice begins to sink into a dejected
monotone.</i>) We went to the Inn and started drinking whiskey.
And I got drunk.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>exasperatedly</i>) I guessed that! And Jim got
drunk, too. And then what?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>dully</i>) Who knows how drunk he got? He had one
of his queer fits when you can't tell. He's the way I told you
about this morning, when he talks like a Broadway crook, who'd
sell his soul for a price, and there's a sneering divil in him,
and he loves to pick out the weakness in people and say cruel,
funny things that flay the hide off them, or play cruel jokes on
them. (<i>with sudden rage</i>) God's curse on him, I'll wager
he's laughing to himself this minute, thinking it's the cutest
joke in the world, the fools he's made of us. You in particular.
Be God, I had my suspicions, at least, but your head was stuffed
with mush and love, and you wouldn't--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>furiously</i>) You'll tell that lie about my love
once too often! And I'll play a joke on him yet that'll make him
sorry he--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>sunk in drunken defeatism again</i>) It's too late.
You shouldn't have let him get away from you to the Inn. You
should have kept him here. Then maybe, if you'd got him drunk
enough you could have--(<i>his head nodding, his eyes
blinking--thickly</i>) But it's no good talking now--no good at
all--no good--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>gives him a shake</i>) Keep hold of your wits or
I'll give you a cuff on both ears! Will you stop blathering like
an old woman and tell me plainly what he's done!</p>

<p>HOGAN--He's agreed to sell the farm, that's what! Simpson came
to the Inn to see him with a new offer from Harder. Ten thousand,
cash.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>overwhelmed</i>) Ten thousand! Sure, three is all
it's worth at most. And two was what you offered that Jim
promised--</p>

<p>HOGAN--What's money to Harder? After what we did to him, all
he wants is revenge. And here's where he's foxy. Simpson must
have put him up to it knowing how Jim hates it here living on a
small allowance, and he longs to go back to Broadway and his
whores. Jim won't have to wait for his half of the cash till the
estate's settled. Harder offers to give him five thousand cash as
a loan against the estate the second the sale is made. Jim can
take the next train to New York.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely, on the verge of tears</i>) And Jim
accepted? I don't believe it!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Don't then. Be God, you'll believe it tomorrow! Harder
proposed that he meet with Jim and the executors in the morning
and settle it, and Jim promised Simpson he would.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>desperately</i>) Maybe he'll get so drunk he'll
never remember--</p>

<p>HOGAN--He won't. Harder's coming in his automobile to pick him
up and make sure of him. Anyway don't think because he forgot you
were waiting--in the moonlight, eating your heart out, that he'd
ever miss a date with five thousand dollars, and all the pretty
whores of Broadway he can buy with it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>distractedly</i>) Will you shut up!
(<i>angrily</i>) And where were you when all this happened?
Couldn't you do anything to stop it, you old loon?</p>

<p>HOGAN--I couldn't. Simpson came and sat at the table with
us--</p>

<p>JOSIE--And you let him!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Jim invited him. Anyway, I wanted to find out what
trick he had up his sleeve, and what Jim would do. When it was
all over, I got up and took a swipe at Simpson, but I missed him.
(<i>with drunken sadness</i>) I was too drunk--too drunk--too
drunk--I missed him, God forgive me! (<i>His chin sinks on his
chest and his eyes shut.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>shakes him</i>) If you don't keep awake, be God, I
won't miss you!</p>

<p>HOGAN--I was going to take a swipe at Jim, too, but I couldn't
do it. My heart was too broken with sorrow. I'd come to love him
like a son--a real son of my heart!--to take the place of that
jackass, Mike, and me two other jackasses.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her face hard and bitter</i>) I think now Mike was
the only one in this house with sense.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I was too drowned in sorrow by his betraying me--and
you he'd pretended to like so much. So I only called him a dirty
lying skunk of a treacherous bastard, and I turned my back on him
and left the Inn, and I made myself sing on the road so he'd
hear, and they'd all hear in the Inn, to show them I didn't care
a damn.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>scathingly</i>) Sure, wasn't you the hero! A hell
of a lot of good--</p>

<p>HOGAN--Ah, well, I suppose the temptation was too great. He's
weak, with one foot in the grave from whiskey. Maybe we shouldn't
blame him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her eyes flashing</i>) Not blame him? Well, I blame
him, God damn him! Are you making excuses for him, you old
fool!</p>

<p>HOGAN--I'm not. He's a dirty snake! But I was thinking how do
I know what I wouldn't do for five thousand cash, and how do you
know what you wouldn't do?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Nothing could make me betray him! (<i>Her face grows
hard and bitter.</i>) Or it couldn't before. There's nothing I
wouldn't do now. (<i>Hogan suddenly begins to chuckle.</i>) Do
you think I'm lying? Just give me a chance--</p>

<p>HOGAN--I remembered something. (<i>He laughs drunkenly.</i>)
Be Christ, Josie, for all his Broadway wisdom about women, you've
made a prize damned fool of him and that's some satisfaction!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>bewildered</i>) How'd you mean?</p>

<p>HOGAN--You'll never believe it. Neither did I, but he kept on
until, be God, I saw he really meant it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Meant what?</p>

<p>HOGAN--It was after he'd turned queer--early in the night
before Simpson came. He started talking about you, as if you was
on his mind, worrying him--and before he finished I take my oath
I began to hope you could really work Mike's first scheme on him,
if you got him alone in the moonlight, because all his gab was
about his great admiration for you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Och! The liar!</p>

<p>HOGAN--He said you had great beauty in you that no one
appreciated but him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>shakenly</i>) You're lying.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Great strength you had, and great pride, he said--and
great goodness, no less! But here's where you've made a prize
jackass of him, like I said. (<i>with a drunken leer</i>) Listen
now, darlin', and don't drop dead with amazement. (<i>He leans
toward her and whispers</i>) He believes you're a virgin!
(<i>Josie stiffens as if she'd been insulted. Hogan goes on.</i>)
He does, so help me! He means it, the poor dunce! He thinks
you're a poor innocent virgin! He thinks it's all boasting and
pretending you've done about being a slut. (<i>He chuckles.</i>)
A virgin, no less! You!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>furiously</i>) Stop saying it! Boasting and
pretending, am I? The dirty liar!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Faith, you don't have to tell me. (<i>Then he looks at
her in drunken surprise--thickly</i>) Are you taking it as an
insult? Why the hell don't you laugh? Be God, you ought to see
what a stupid sheep that makes him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>forces a laugh</i>) I do see it.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>chuckling drunkenly</i>) Oh, be God, I've just
remembered another thing, Josie. I know why he didn't keep his
date with you. It wasn't that he'd forgot. He remembered well
enough, for he talked about it--</p>

<p>JOSIE--You mean he deliberately, knowing I'd be
waiting--(<i>fiercely</i>) God damn him!</p>

<p>HOGAN--He as much as told me his reason, though he wouldn't
come out with it plain, me being your father. His conscience was
tormenting him. He's going to leave you alone and not see you
again--for your sake, because he loves you! (<i>He
chuckles.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>looks stricken and bewildered--her voice
trembling</i>) Loves me? You're making it up.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I'm not. I know it sounds crazy but--</p>

<p>JOSIE--What did he mean, for my sake?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Can't you see? You're a pure virgin to him, but all the
same there's things besides your beautiful soul he feels drawn
to, like your beautiful hair and eyes, and--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>strickenly</i>) Och, don't, Father! You know I'm
only a big--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>as if she hadn't spoken</i>) So he'll keep away
from temptation because he can't trust himself, and it'd be a sin
on his conscience if he was to seduce you. (<i>He laughs
drunkenly.</i>) Oh, be God! If that ain't rich!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>Her voice trembles.</i>) So that was his
reason--(<i>then angrily</i>) So he thinks all he has to do is
crook a finger and I'll fall for him, does he, the vain Broadway
crook!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>chuckling</i>) Be Jaysus, it was the maddest thing
in the world, him gabbing like a soft loon about you--and there
at the bar in plain sight was two of the men you've been out
with, the gardener at Smith's and Regan, the chauffeur for
Driggs, having a drink together!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with a twitching smile</i>) It must have been mad,
surely. I wish I'd been there to laugh up my sleeve.
(<i>angry</i>) But what's all his crazy lying blather got to do
with him betraying us and selling the place?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>at once hopelessly dejected again</i>) Nothing at
all. I only thought you'd like to know you'd had that much
revenge.</p>

<p>JOSIE--A hell of a revenge! I'll have a better one than that
on him--or I'll try to! I'm not like you, owning up I'm beaten
and crying wurra-wurra like a coward and getting hopeless drunk!
(<i>She gives him a shake.</i>) Get your wits about you and
answer me this: Did Simpson get him to sign a paper?</p>

<p>HOGAN--No, but what good is that? In the morning he'll sign
all they shove in front of him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--It's this good. It means we still have a chance. Or I
have.</p>

<p>HOGAN--What chance? Are you going to beg him to take pity on
us?</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'll see him in hell first! There's another chance, and
a good one. But I'll need your help--(<i>angrily</i>) And look at
you, your brains drowned in whiskey, so I can't depend on
you!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>rousing himself</i>) You can, if there's any
chance. Be God, I'll make myself as sober as a judge for you in
the wink of an eye! (<i>then dejectedly</i>) But what can you do
now, darlin'? You haven't even got him here. He's down at the Inn
sitting alone, drinking and dreaming of the little whores he'll
be with tomorrow night on Broadway.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'll get him here! I'll humble my pride and go down to
the Inn for him! And if he doesn't want to come I've a way to
make him. I'll raise a scene and pretend I'm in a rage because he
forgot his date. I'll disgrace him till he'll be glad to come
with me to shut me up. I know his weakness, and it's his vanity
about his women. If I was a dainty, pretty tart he'd be proud I'd
raise a rumpus about him. But when it's a big, ugly hulk like
me--(<i>She falters and forces herself to go on.</i>) If he ever
was tempted to want me, he'd be ashamed of it. That's the truth
behind the lies he told you of his conscience and his fear he
might ruin me, God damn him!</p>

<p>HOGAN--No, he meant it, Josie. But never mind that now. Let's
say you've got him here. Then what will you do?</p>

<p>JOSIE--I told you this morning if he ever broke his promise to
us I'd do anything and not mind how crooked it was. And I will!
Your part in it is to come at sunrise with witnesses and catch us
in--(<i>She falters.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--In bed, is it? Then it's Mike's second scheme you're
thinking about?</p>

<p>JOSIE--I told you I didn't care how dirty a trick--(<i>with a
hard bitter laugh</i>) The dirtier the better now!</p>

<p>HOGAN--But how'll you get him in bed, with all his honorable
scruples, thinking you're a virgin? But I'm forgetting he stayed
away because he was afraid he'd be tempted. So maybe--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) For the love of God, don't harp on his
lies. He won't be tempted at all. But I'll get him so drunk he'll
fall asleep and I'll carry him in and put him in bed--</p>

<p>HOGAN--Be God, that's the way! But you'll have to get a pile
of whiskey down him. You'll never do it unless you're more
sociable and stop looking at him, the way you do, whenever he
takes a drink, as if you was praying Almighty God to forgive a
poor drunkard. You've got to encourage him. The best way would be
for you to drink with him. It would put him at his ease and
unsuspecting, and it'd give you courage, too, so you'd act bold
for a change instead of giving him brazen talk he's tired of
hearing, while you act shy as a mouse.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>gives her father a bitter, resentful look</i>)
You're full of sly advice all of a sudden, ain't you? You dirty
little tick!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>angrily</i>) Didn't you tell me to get hold of my
wits? Be God, if you want me drunk, I've only to let go. That'd
suit me. I want to forget my sorrow, and I've no faith in your
scheme because you'll be too full of scruples. Like the drinking.
You're such a virtuous teetotaller--</p>

<p>JOSIE--I've told you I'd do anything now! (<i>then
confusedly</i>) All I meant was, it's not right, a father to tell
his daughter how to--(<i>then angrily</i>) I don't need your
advice. Haven't I had every man I want around here?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Ah, thank God, that sounds natural! Be God, I thought
you'd started playing virgin with me just because that Broadway
sucker thinks you're one.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>furiously</i>) Shut up! I'm not playing anything.
And don't worry I can't do my part of the trick.</p>

<p>HOGAN--That's the talk! But let me get it all clear. I come at
sunrise with my witnesses, and you've forgot to lock your door,
and we walk in, and there's the two of you in bed, and I raise
the roof and threaten him if he don't marry you--</p>

<p>JOSIE--Marry him? After what he's done to us? I wouldn't marry
him now if he was the last man on earth! All we want is a paper
signed by him with witnesses that he'll sell the farm to you for
the price you offered, and not to Harder.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Well, that's justice, but that's all it is. I thought
you wanted to make him pay for his black treachery against us,
the dirty bastard!</p>

<p>JOSIE--I do want! (<i>She again gives him a bitter resentful
glance.</i>) It's the estate money you're thinking of, isn't it?
Leave it to you! (<i>hastily</i>) Well, so am I! I'd like to get
my hooks on it! (<i>with a hard, brazen air</i>) Be God, if I'm
to play whore, I deserve my pay! We'll make him sign a paper he
owes me ten thousand dollars the minute the estate is settled.
(<i>She laughs.</i>) How's that? I'll bet none of his tarts on
Broadway ever got a thousandth part of that out of him, no matter
how dainty and pretty! (<i>laughing again</i>) And here's what'll
be the greatest joke to teach him a lesson. He'll pay it for
nothing! I'll get him in bed but I'll never let him--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>with delighted admiration</i>) Och, by Jaysus,
Josie, that's the best yet! (<i>He slaps his thigh
enthusiastically.</i>) Oh, that'll teach him to double-cross his
friends! That'll show him two can play at tricks! And him
believing you so innocent! Be God, you'll make him the prize
sucker of the world! Won't I roar inside me when I see his face
in the morning! (<i>He bursts into coarse laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>again with illogical resentment</i>) Stop laughing!
You're letting yourself be drunk again. (<i>then with a hard,
business-like air</i>) We've done enough talking. Let's
start--</p>

<p>HOGAN--Wait, now. There's another thing. Just what do you want
me to threaten him with when I catch you? That we'll sue him for
outraging your virtue? Sure, his lawyer would have all your old
flames in the witness box, till the jury would think you'd been
faithful to the male inhabitants of America. So what threat--I
can't think of any he wouldn't laugh at.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) Well, I can! Do I have to tell you his
weakness again? It's his vanity about women, and his Broadway
pride he's so wise no woman could fool him. It's the disgrace to
his vanity--being caught with the likes of me--(<i>falteringly,
but forcing herself to go on</i>) My mug beside his in all the
newspapers--the New York papers, too--he'll see the whole of
Broadway splitting their sides laughing at him--and he'll give
anything to keep us quiet, I tell you. He will! I know him! So
don't worry--(<i>She ends up on the verge of bitter humiliated
tears.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>without looking at her--enthusiastic again</i>) Be
God, you're right!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>gives him a bitter glance--fiercely</i>) Then get
the hell out of that chair and let's start it! (<i>He gets up.
She surveys him resentfully.</i>) You're steady on your pins,
ain't you, you scheming old thief, now there's the smell of money
around! (<i>quickly</i>) Well, I'm glad. I know I can depend on
you now. You'll walk down to the Inn with me and hide outside
until you see me come out with him. Then you can sneak in the Inn
yourself and pick the witnesses to stay up with you. But mind you
don't get drunk again, and let them get too drunk.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I won't, I take my oath! (<i>He pats her on the
shoulder approvingly.</i>) Be God, you've got the proud, fighting
spirit in you that never says die, and you make me ashamed of my
weakness. You're that eager now, be damned if I don't almost
think you're glad of the excuse!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stiffens</i>) Excuse for what, you old--</p>

<p>HOGAN--To show him no man can get the best of you--what
else?--like you showed all the others.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'll show him to his sorrow! (<i>then abruptly,
starting for the screen door at left</i>) Come on. We've no time
to waste. (<i>But when she gets to the door, she appears suddenly
hesitant and timid--hurriedly</i>) Wait. I'd better give a look
at myself in the mirror. (<i>in a brazen tone</i>) Sure, those in
my trade have to look their best! (<i>She hurries back across the
room into her bedroom and closes the door. Hogan stares after
her. Abruptly he ceases to look like a drunk who, by an effort,
is keeping himself half-sober. He is a man who has been drinking
a lot but is still clear-headed and has complete control of
himself.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>watches the crack under Josie's door and speaks
half-aloud to himself, shaking his head pityingly</i>) A look in
the mirror and she's forgot to light her lamp!
(<i>remorsefully</i>) God forgive me, it's bitter medicine. But
it's the only way I can see that has a chance now. (<i>Josie's
door opens. At once, he is as he was. She comes out, a fixed
smile on her lips, her head high, her face set defiantly. But she
has evidently been crying.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>brazenly</i>) There, now. Don't I look ten thousand
dollars' worth to any drunk?</p>

<p>HOGAN--You look a million, darlin'!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>goes to the screen door and pushes it open with the
manner of one who has burned all bridges</i>) Come along, then.
(<i>She goes out. He follows close on her heels. She stops
abruptly on the first step--startledly</i>) Look! There's someone
on the road--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>pushes past her down the steps--peering off
left-front--as if aloud to himself, in dismay</i>) Be God, it's
him! I never thought--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>as if aloud to herself</i>) So he didn't
forget--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>quickly</i>) Well, it proves he can't keep away
from you, and that'll make it easier for you--(<i>then
furiously</i>) Oh, the dirty, double-crossing bastard! The nerve
of him! Coming to call on you, after making you wait for hours,
thinking you don't know what he's done to us this night, and
it'll be a fine cruel joke to blarney you in the moonlight, and
you trusting him like a poor sheep, and never suspecting--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stung</i>) Shut up! I'll teach him who's the joker!
I'll let him go on as if you hadn't told me what he's done--</p>

<p>HOGAN--Yes, don't let him suspect it, or you wouldn't fool
him. He'd know you were after revenge. But he can see me here
now. I can't sneak away or he'd be suspicious. We've got to think
of a new scheme quick to get me away--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>quickly</i>) I know how. Pretend you're as drunk as
when you came. Make him believe you're so drunk you don't
remember what he's done, so he can't suspect you told me.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I will. Be God, Josie, damned if I don't think he's so
queer drunk himself he don't remember, or he'd never come
here.</p>

<p>JOSIE--The drunker he is the better! (<i>lowering her
voice--quickly</i>) He's turned in the gate where he can hear us.
Pretend we're fighting and I'm driving you off till you're sober.
Say you won't be back tonight. It'll make him sure he'll have the
night alone with me. You start the fight.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>becomes at once very drunk. He shouts</i>) Put me
out of my own home, will you, you undutiful slut!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Celebration or not, I'll have no drunks cursing and
singing all night. Go back to the Inn.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I will! I'll get a room and two bottles and stay drunk
as long as I please!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Don't come back till you've slept it off, or I'll wipe
the floor with you! (<i>Tyrone enters, left-front. He does not
appear to be drunk--that is, he shows none of the usual symptoms.
He seems much the same as in Act One. The only perceptible change
is that his eyes have a peculiar fixed, glazed look, and there is
a certain vague quality in his manner and speech, as if he were a
bit hazy and absent-minded.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>dryly</i>) Just in time for the Big Bout. Or is
this the final round?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>whirls on him unsteadily</i>) Who the
hell--(<i>peering at him</i>) Oh, it's you, is it?</p>

<p>TYRONE--What was the big idea, Phil, leaving me flat?</p>

<p>HOGAN--Leave you flat? Be Jaysus, that reminds me I owe you a
swipe on the jaw for something. What was it? Be God, I'm too
drunk to remember. But here it is, anyway. (<i>He turns loose a
round-house swing that misses Tyrone by a couple of feet, and
reels away. Tyrone regards him with vague surprise.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Stop it, you damned old fool, and get out of here!</p>

<p>HOGAN--Taking his side against your poor old father, are you?
A hell of a daughter! (<i>He draws himself up with drunken
dignity.</i>) Don't expect me home tonight, Miss Hogan, or
tomorrow either, maybe. You can take your bad temper out on your
sweetheart here. (<i>He starts off down the road, left-front,
with a last word over his shoulder.</i>) Bad luck to you both.
(<i>He disappears. A moment later he begins to bawl his mournful
Irish song.</i>) "Oh, the praties they grow small, Over here,
over here," etc. (<i>During a part of the following scene the
song continues to be heard at intervals, receding as he gets
farther off on his way to the Inn.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Well, thank God. That's good riddance. (<i>She comes to
Tyrone, who stands staring after Hogan with a puzzled
look.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--I've never seen him that stinko before. Must have got
him all of a sudden. He didn't seem so lit up at the Inn, but I
guess I wasn't paying much attention.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>forcing a playful air</i>) I should think, if you
were a real gentleman, you'd be apologizing to me, not thinking
of him. Don't you know you're two hours and a half late? I
oughtn't to speak to you, if I had any pride.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>stares at her curiously</i>) You've got too damn
much pride, Josie. That's the trouble.</p>

<p>JOSIE--And just what do you mean by that, Jim?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>shrugs his shoulders</i>) Nothing. Forget it. I do
apologize, Josie. I'm damned sorry. Haven't any excuse. Can't
think up a lie. (<i>staring at her curiously again</i>) Or, now I
think of it, I had a damned good honorable excuse, but--(<i>He
shrugs.</i>) Nuts. Forget it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Holy Joseph, you're full of riddles tonight. Well, I
don't need excuses. I forgive you, anyway, now you're here.
(<i>She takes his hand--playfully</i>) Come on now and we'll sit
on my bedroom steps and be romantic in the moonlight, like we
planned to. (<i>She leads him there. He goes along in an
automatic way, as if only half-conscious of what he is doing. She
sits on the top step and pulls him down on the step beneath her.
A pause. He stares vaguely at nothing. She bends to give him an
uneasy appraising glance.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>suddenly, begins to talk mechanically</i>) Had to
get out of the damned Inn. I was going batty alone there. The old
heebie-jeebies. So I came to you. (<i>He pauses--then adds</i>
<i>with strange, wondering sincerity</i>) I've really begun to
love you a lot, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>blurts out bitterly</i>) Yes, you've proved that
tonight, haven't you? (<i>hurriedly regaining her playful
tone</i>) But never mind. I said I'd forgive you for being so
late. So go on about love. I'm all ears.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>as if he hadn't listened</i>) I thought you'd have
given me up and gone to bed. I remember I had some nutty idea I'd
get in bed with you--just to lie with my head on your breast.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>moved in spite of herself--but keeps her bold,
playful tone</i>) Well, maybe I'll let you--(<i>hurriedly</i>)
Later on, I mean. The night's young yet, and we'll have it all to
ourselves. (<i>boldly again</i>) But here's for a starter.
(<i>She puts her arms around him and draws him back till his head
is on her breast.</i>) There, now.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>relaxes--simply and gratefully</i>) Thanks, Josie.
(<i>He closes his eyes. For a moment, she forgets everything and
stares down at his face with a passionate, possessive tenderness.
A pause. From far-off on the road to the Inn, Hogan's mournful
song drifts back through the moonlight quiet:</i> "Oh, the
praties they grow small, Over here, over here." <i>Tyrone rouses
himself and straightens up. He acts embarrassed, as if he felt
he'd been making a fool of himself--mockingly</i>) Hark, Hark,
the Donegal lark! "Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird."
Can't Phil sing anything but that damned dirge, Josie? (<i>She
doesn't reply. He goes on hazily.</i>) Still, it seems to belong
tonight--in the moonlight--or in my mind--(<i>He quotes</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Now more than ever seems it rich to die,<br>
 To cease upon the midnight with no pain,<br>
 In such an ecstasy!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>(<i>He has recited this with deep feeling. Now he sneers</i>)
Good God! Ode to Phil the Irish Nightingale! I must have the
D.T.'s.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her face grown bitter</i>) Maybe it's only your bad
conscience.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>starts guiltily and turns to stare into her
face--suspiciously</i>) What put that in your head? Conscience
about what?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>quickly</i>) How would I know, if you don't?
(<i>forcing</i> <i>a playful tone</i>) For the sin of wanting to
be in bed with me. Maybe that's it.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>with strange relief</i>) Oh. (<i>a bit
shamefacedly</i>) Forget that stuff, Josie. I was half nutty.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>bitterly</i>) Och, for the love of God, don't
apologize as if you was ashamed of--(<i>She catches
herself.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>with a quick glance at her face</i>) All right. I
certainly won't apologize--if you're not kicking. I was afraid I
might have shocked your modesty.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>roughly</i>) <i>My</i> modesty? Be God, I didn't
know I had any left.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>draws away from her--irritably</i>) Nix, Josie.
Lay off that line, for tonight at least. (<i>He adds slowly</i>)
I'd like tonight to be different.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Different from what? (<i>He doesn't answer. She forces
a light tone.</i>) All right. I'll be as different as you
please.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>simply</i>) Thanks, Josie. Just be yourself.
(<i>again as if he were ashamed, or afraid he had revealed some
weakness--off-handedly</i>) This being out in the moonlight
instead of the lousy Inn isn't a bad bet, at that. I don't know
why I hang out in that dump, except I'm even more bored in the
so-called good hotels in this hick town.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>trying to examine his face without his knowing</i>)
Well, you'll be back on Broadway soon now, won't you?</p>

<p>TYRONE--I hope so.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Then you'll have all the pretty little tarts to comfort
you when you get your sorrowful spell on.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Oh, to hell with the rough stuff, Josie! You promised
you'd can it tonight.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) You're a fine one to talk of
promises!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>vaguely surprised by her tone</i>) What's the
matter? Still sore at me for being late?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>quickly</i>) I'm not. I was teasing you. To prove
there's no hard feelings, how would you like a drink? But I
needn't ask. (<i>She gets up.</i>) I'll get a bottle of his
best.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>mechanically</i>) Fine. Maybe that will have some
kick. The booze at the Inn didn't work tonight.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Well, this'll work. (<i>She starts to go into her
bedroom. He sits hunched up on the step, staring at nothing. She
pauses in the doorway to glance back. The hard, calculating
expression on</i> <i>her face softens. For a second she stares at
him, bewildered by her conflicting feelings. Then she goes
inside, leaving the door open. She opens the door from her room
to the lighted living room, and is seen going to the kitchen on
the way to the cellar. She has left the door from the living room
to her bedroom open and the light reveals a section of the
bedroom framed in the doorway behind Tyrone. The foot of the bed
which occupies most of the room can be seen, and that is all
except that the walls are unpainted pine boards. Tyrone continues
to stare at nothing, but becomes restless. His hands and mouth
twitch.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>suddenly, with intense hatred</i>) You rotten
bastard! (<i>He springs to his feet--fumbles in his pockets for
cigarettes--strikes a match which lights up his face, on which
there is now an expression of miserable guilt. His hand is
trembling so violently he cannot light the cigarette.</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a03">ACT THREE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The living-room wall has been replaced and all we
see now of its lighted interior is through the two windows.
Otherwise, everything is the same, and this Act follows the
preceding without any lapse of time. Tyrone is still trying with
shaking hands to get his cigarette lighted. Finally he succeeds,
and takes a deep inhale, and starts pacing back and forth a few
steps, as if in a cell of his own thought. He swears
defensively.</i> God damn it. You'll be crying in your beer in a
minute. (<i>He begins to sing sneeringly half under his breath a
snatch from an old sob song, popular in the Nineties.</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And baby's cries can't waken her<br>
 In the baggage coach ahead."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>(<i>His sneer changes to a look of stricken guilt and
grief.</i>) Christ! (<i>He seems about to break down and sob but
he fights this back.</i>) Cut it out, you drunken fool! (<i>Josie
can be seen through the windows, returning from the kitchen. He
turns with a look of relief and escape.</i>) Thank God! (<i>He
sits on the boulder and waits. Josie stops by the table in the
living room to turn down the lamp until only a dim light remains.
She has a quart of whiskey under her arm, two tumblers, and a
pitcher of water. She goes through her bedroom and appears in the
outer doorway. Tyrone gets up.</i>) Ah! At last the old booze!
(<i>He relieves her of the pitcher and tumblers as she comes down
the steps.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with a fixed smile</i>) You'd think I'd been gone
years. You didn't seem so perishing for a drink.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>in his usual, easy, kidding way</i>) It's you I
was perishing for. I've been dying of loneliness--</p>

<p>JOSIE--You'll die of lying some day. But I'm glad you're alive
again. I thought when I left you really were dying on me.</p>

<p>TYRONE--No such luck.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Och, don't talk like that. Come have a drink. We'll use
the boulder for a table and I'll be barkeep. (<i>He puts the
pitcher and tumblers on the boulder and she uncorks the bottle.
She takes a quick glance at his face--startledly</i>) What's come
over you, Jim? You look as if you've seen a ghost.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>looks away--dryly</i>) I have. My own. He's punk
company.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Yes, it's the worst ghost of all, your own. Don't I
know? But this will keep it in its place. (<i>She pours a tumbler
half full of whiskey and hands it to him.</i>) Here. But wait
till I join you. (<i>She pours the other tumbler half
full.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>surprised</i>) Hello! I thought you never touched
it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>glibly</i>) I have on occasion. And this is one. I
don't want to be left out altogether from celebrating our victory
over Harder. (<i>She gives him a sharp bitter glance. Meeting his
eyes, which are regarding her with puzzled wonder, she forces a
laugh.</i>) Don't look at me as if I was up to some game. A drink
or two will make me better company, and help me enjoy the moon
and the night with you. Here's luck. (<i>She touches his glass
with hers.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>shrugs his shoulders</i>) All right. Here's luck.
(<i>They drink. She gags and sputters. He pours water in her
glass. She drinks it. He puts his glass and the pitcher back on
the boulder. He keeps staring at her with a puzzled
frown.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Some of it went down the wrong way.</p>

<p>TYRONE--So I see. That'll teach you to pour out baths instead
of drinks.</p>

<p>JOSIE--It's the first time I ever heard you complain a drink
was too big.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Yours was too big.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'm my father's daughter. I've a strong head. So don't
worry I'll pass out and you'll have to put me to bed. (<i>She
gives a little bold laugh.</i>) Sure, that's a beautiful notion.
I'll have to pretend I'm--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>irritably</i>) Nix on the raw stuff, Josie.
Remember you said--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>resentment in her kidding</i>) I'd be different?
That's right. I'm forgetting it's your pleasure to have me
pretend I'm an innocent virgin tonight.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>in a strange tone that is almost threatening</i>)
If you don't look out, I'll call you on that bluff, Josie. (<i>He
stares at her with a deliberate sensualist's look that undresses
her.</i>) I'd like to. You know that, don't you?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>boldly</i>) I don't at all. You're the one who's
bluffing.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>grabs her in his arms--with genuine passion</i>)
Josie! (<i>Then as suddenly he lets her go.</i>) Nix. Let's cut
it out. (<i>He turns away. Her face betrays the confused conflict
within her of fright, passion, happiness, and bitter resentment.
He goes on with an abrupt change of tone.</i>) How about another
drink? That's honest-to-God old bonded Bourbon. How the devil did
Phil get hold of it?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Tom Lombardo, the bootlegger, gave him a case for
letting him hide a truckload in our barn when the agents were
after him. He stole it from a warehouse on faked permits. (<i>She
pours out drinks as she speaks, a half tumblerful for him, a
small one for herself.</i>) Here you are. (<i>She gives him his
drink--smiles at him coquettishly, beginning to show the effect
of her big drink by her increasingly bold manner.</i>) Let's sit
down where the moon will be in our eyes and we'll see romance.
(<i>She takes his arm and leads him to her bedroom steps. She
sits on the top step, pulling him down beside her but on the one
below. She raises her glass.</i>) Here's hoping before the
night's out you'll have more courage and kiss me at least.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>frowns--then kiddingly</i>) That's a promise.
Here's how. (<i>He drains his tumbler. She drinks half of hers.
He puts his glass on the ground beside him. A pause. She tries to
read his face without his noticing. He seems to be lapsing again
into vague preoccupation.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Now don't sink back half-dead-and-alive in dreams the
way you were before.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>quickly</i>) I'm not. I had a good final dose of
heebie-jeebies when you were in the house. That's all for
tonight. (<i>He adds a bit maudlinly, his two big drinks
beginning to affect him</i>) Let the dead past bury its dead.</p>

<p>JOSIE--That's the talk. There's only tonight, and the moon,
and us--and the bonded Bourbon. Have another drink, and don't
wait for me.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Not now, thanks. They're coming too fast. (<i>He gives
her a curious, cynically amused look.</i>) Trying to get me
soused, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>starts--quickly</i>) I'm not. Only to get you
feeling happy, so you'll forget all sadness.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>kiddingly</i>) I might forget all my honorable
intentions, too. So look out.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'll look forward to it--and I hope that's another
promise, like the kiss you owe me. If you're suspicious I'm
trying to get you soused--well, here goes. (<i>She drinks what is
left in her glass.</i>) There, now. I must be scheming to get
myself soused, too.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Maybe you are.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>resentfully</i>) If I was, it'd be to make you feel
at home. Don't all the pretty little Broadway tarts get soused
with you?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>irritably</i>) There you go again with that old
line!</p>

<p>JOSIE--All right, I won't! (<i>forcing a laugh</i>) I must be
eaten up with jealousy for them, that's it.</p>

<p>TYRONE--You needn't be. They don't belong.</p>

<p>JOSIE--And I do?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Yes. You do.</p>

<p>JOSIE--For tonight only, you mean?</p>

<p>TYRONE--We've agreed there is only tonight--and it's to be
different from any past night--for both of us.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>in a forced, kidding tone</i>) I hope it will be.
I'll try to control my envy for your Broadway flames. I suppose
it's because I have a picture of them in my mind as small and
dainty and pretty--</p>

<p>TYRONE--They're just gold-digging tramps.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>as if he hadn't spoken</i>) While I'm only a big,
rough, ugly cow of a woman.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Shut up! You're beautiful.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>jeeringly, but her voice trembles</i>) God pity the
blind!</p>

<p>TYRONE--You're beautiful to me.</p>

<p>JOSIE--It must be the Bourbon--</p>

<p>TYRONE--You're real and healthy and clean and fine and warm
and strong and kind--</p>

<p>JOSIE--I have a beautiful soul, you mean?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Well, I don't know much about ladies' souls--(<i>He
takes her hand.</i>) But I do know you're beautiful. (<i>He
kisses her hand.</i>) And I love you a lot--in my fashion.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stammers</i>) Jim--(<i>hastily forcing her playful
tone</i>) Sure, you're full of fine compliments all of a sudden,
and I ought to show you how pleased I am. (<i>She pulls his head
back and kisses him on the lips--a quick, shy kiss.</i>) That's
for my beautiful soul.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>The kiss arouses his physical desire. He pulls her
head down and stares into her eyes.</i>) You have a beautiful
strong body, too, Josie--and beautiful eyes and hair, and a
beautiful smile and beautiful warm breasts. (<i>He kisses her on
the lips. She pulls back frightenedly for a second--then returns
his kiss. Suddenly he breaks away--in a tone of guilty
irritation</i>) Nix! Nix! Don't be a fool, Josie. Don't let me
pull that stuff.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>triumphant for a second</i>) You meant it! I know
you meant it! (<i>then with resentful bitterness--roughly</i>) Be
God, you're right I'm a damned fool to let you make me forget
you're the greatest liar in the world! (<i>quickly</i>) I mean,
the greatest kidder. And now, how about another drink?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>staring at nothing--vaguely</i>) You don't get me,
Josie. You don't know--and I hope you never will know--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>blurts out bitterly</i>) Maybe I know more than you
think.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>as if she hadn't spoken</i>) There's always the
aftermath that poisons you. I don't want you to be poisoned--</p>

<p>JOSIE--Maybe you know what you're talking about--</p>

<p>TYRONE--And I don't want to be poisoned myself--not again--not
with you. (<i>He pauses--slowly</i>) There have been too many
nights--and dawns. This must be different. I want--(<i>His voice
trails off into silence.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>trying to read his face--uneasily</i>) Don't get in
one of your queer spells, now. (<i>She gives his shoulder a
shake--forcing a light tone</i>) Sure, I don't think you know
what you want. Except another drink. I'm sure you want that. And
I want one, too.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>recovering himself</i>) Fine! Grand idea. (<i>He
gets up and brings the bottle from the boulder. He picks up his
tumbler and pours a big drink. She is holding out her tumbler but
he ignores it.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--You're not polite, pouring your own first.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I said a drink was a grand idea--for me. Not for you.
You skip this one.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>resentfully</i>) Oh, I do, do I? Are you giving me
orders?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Yes. Take a big drink of moonlight instead.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>angrily</i>) You'll pour me a drink, if you please,
Jim Tyrone, or--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>stares at her--then shrugs his shoulders</i>) All
right, if you want to take it that way, Josie. It's your funeral.
(<i>He pours a drink into her tumbler.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>ashamed but defiant--stiffly</i>) Thank you kindly.
(<i>She raises her glass--mockingly</i>) Here's to tonight.
(<i>Tyrone is staring at her, a strange bitter disgust in his
eyes. Suddenly he slaps at her hand, knocking the glass to the
ground.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>his voice hard with repulsion</i>) I've slept with
drunken tramps on too many nights!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stares at him, too startled and bewildered to be
angry. Her voice trembles with surprising meekness.</i>) All
right, Jim, if you don't want me to--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>now looks as bewildered by his action as she
does</i>) I'm sorry, Josie. Don't know what the drink got into
me. (<i>He picks up her glass.</i>) Here. I'll pour you
another.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>still meek</i>) No, thank you. I'll skip this one.
(<i>She puts the glass on the ground.</i>) But you drink up.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Thanks. (<i>He gulps down his drink. Mechanically, as
if he didn't know what he was doing, he pours another. Suddenly
he blurts out with guilty loathing</i>) That fat blonde pig on
the train--I got her drunk! That's why--(<i>He stops
guiltily.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>uneasily</i>) What are you talking about? What
train?</p>

<p>TYRONE--No train. Don't mind me. (<i>He gulps down the drink
and pours another with the same strange air of acting
unconsciously.</i>) Maybe I'll tell you--later, when I'm--That'll
cure you--for all time! (<i>Abruptly he realizes what he is
saying. He gives the characteristic shrug of
shoulders--cynically</i>) Nuts! The Brooklyn boys are talking
again. I guess I'm more stewed than I thought--in the center of
the old bean, at least. (<i>dully</i>) I better beat it back to
the Inn and go to bed and stop bothering you, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>bullyingly--and pityingly</i>) Well, you won't, not
if I have to hold you. Come on now, bring your drink and sit down
like you were before. (<i>He does so. She pats his cheek--forcing
a playful air</i>) That's a good boy. And I won't take any more
whiskey. I've all the effect from it I want already. Everything
is far away and doesn't matter--except the moon and its dreams,
and I'm part of the dreams--and you are, too. (<i>She adds with a
rueful little laugh</i>) I keep forgetting the thing I've got to
remember. I keep hoping it's a lie, even though I know I'm a
damned fool.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>hazily</i>) Damned fool about what?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Never mind. (<i>forcing a laugh</i>) I've just had a
thought. If my poor old father had seen you knocking his prize
whiskey on the ground--Holy Joseph, he'd have had three paralytic
strokes!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>grins</i>) Yes, I can picture him. (<i>He
pauses--with amused affection</i>) But that's all a fake. He
loves to play tightwad, but the people he likes know better. He'd
give them his shirt. He's a grand old scout, Josie. (<i>a bit
maudlin</i>) The only real friend I've got left--except you. I
love his guts.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely--sickened by his hypocrisy</i>) Och, for
the love of God--!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>shrugs his shoulders</i>) Yes, I suppose that does
sound like moaning-at-the-bar stuff. But I mean it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Do you? Well, I know my father's virtues without you
telling me.</p>

<p>TYRONE--You ought to appreciate him because he worships the
ground you walk on--and he knows you a lot better than you think.
(<i>He turns to smile at her teasingly.</i>) As well as I
do--almost.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>defensively</i>) That's not saying much. Maybe I
can guess what you think you know--(<i>forcing a contemptuous
laugh</i>) If it's that, God pity you, you're a terrible
fool.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>teasingly</i>) If it's what? I haven't said
anything.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You'd better not, or I'll die laughing at you. (<i>She
changes the subject abruptly.</i>) Why don't you drink up? It
makes me nervous watching you hold it as if you didn't know it
was there.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I didn't, at that. (<i>He drinks.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--And have another.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>a bit drunkenly</i>) Will a whore go to a picnic?
Real bonded Bourbon. That's my dish. (<i>He goes to the boulder
for the bottle. He is as steady on his feet as if he were
completely sober.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>in a light tone</i>) Bring the bottle back so it'll
be handy and you won't have to leave me. I miss you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>comes back with the bottle. He smiles at her
cynically.</i>) Still trying to get me soused, Josie?</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'm not such a fool--with your capacity.</p>

<p>TYRONE--You better watch your step. It might work--and then
think of how disgusted you'd feel, with me lying beside you,
probably snoring, as you watched the dawn come. You don't
know--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>defiantly</i>) The hell I don't! Isn't that the way
I've felt with every one of them, after?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>as if he hadn't heard--bitterly</i>) But take it
from me, I know. I've seen too God-damned many dawns creeping
grayly over too many dirty windows.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>ignores this--boldly</i>) But it might be different
with you. Love could make it different. And I've been head over
heels in love ever since you said you loved my beautiful soul.
(<i>Again he doesn't seem to have heard--resentfully</i>) Don't
stand there like a loon, mourning over the past. Why don't you
pour yourself a drink and sit down?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>looks at the bottle and tumbler in his hands, as
if he'd forgotten them--mechanically</i>) Sure thing. Real bonded
Bourbon. I ought to know. If I had a dollar for every drink of it
I had before Prohibition, I'd hire our dear bully, Harder, for a
valet. (<i>Josie stiffens and her face hardens. Tyrone pours a
drink and sets the bottle on the ground. He looks up suddenly
into her eyes--warningly</i>) You'd better remember I said you
had beautiful eyes and hair--and breasts.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I remember you did. (<i>She tries to be calculatingly
enticing.</i>) So sit down and I'll let you lay your head--</p>

<p>TYRONE--No. If you won't watch your step, I've got to. (<i>He
sits down but doesn't lean back.</i>) And don't let me get away
with pretending I'm so soused I don't know what I'm doing. I
always know. Or part of me does. That's the trouble. (<i>He
pauses--then bursts out in a strange threatening tone</i>) You
better look out, Josie. She was tickled to death to get me
pie-eyed. Had an idea she could roll me, I guess. She wasn't so
tickled about it--later on.</p>

<p>JOSIE--What she? (<i>He doesn't reply. She forces a light
tone.</i>) I hope you don't think I'm scheming to roll you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>vaguely</i>) What? (<i>coming to--indignantly</i>)
Of course not. What are you talking about? For God's sake, you're
not a tart.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>roughly</i>) No, I'm a fool. I'm always giving it
away.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>angrily</i>) That lousy bluff again, eh? You're a
liar! For Christ sake, quit the smut stuff, can't you!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stung</i>) Listen to me, Jim! Drunk or not, don't
you talk that way to me or--</p>

<p>TYRONE--How about your not talking the old smut stuff to me?
You promised you'd be yourself. (<i>pauses--vaguely</i>) You
don't get it, Josie. You see, she was one of the smuttiest
talking pigs I've ever listened to.</p>

<p>JOSIE--What she? Do you mean the blonde on the train?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>starts--sharply</i>) Train? Who told you--?
(<i>quickly</i>) Oh--that's right--I did say--(<i>vaguely</i>)
What blonde? What's the difference? Coming back from the Coast.
It was long ago. But it seems like tonight. There is no present
or future--only the past happening over and over again--now. You
can't get away from it. (<i>abruptly</i>) Nuts! To hell with that
crap.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You came back from the Coast about a year ago
after--(<i>She checks herself.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>dully</i>) Yes. After Mama's death.
(<i>quickly</i>) But I've been to the Coast a lot of times during
my career as a third-rate ham. I don't remember which time--or
anything much--except I was pie-eyed in a drawing room the whole
four days. (<i>abruptly</i>) What were we talking about before?
What a grand guy Phil is. You ought to be glad you've got him for
a father. Mine was an old bastard.</p>

<p>JOSIE--He wasn't! He was one of the finest, kindest gentlemen
ever lived.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>sneeringly</i>) Outside the family, sure. Inside,
he was a lousy tightwad bastard.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>repelled</i>) You ought to be ashamed!</p>

<p>TYRONE--To speak ill of the dead? Nuts! He can't hear, and he
knows I hated him, anyway--as much as he hated me. I'm glad he's
dead. So is he. Or he ought to be. Everyone ought to be, if they
have any sense. Out of a bum racket. At peace. (<i>He shrugs his
shoulders.</i>) Nuts! What of it?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) Don't Jim. I hate you when you talk
like that. (<i>forcing a light tone</i>) Do you want to spoil our
beautiful moonlight night? And don't be telling me of your old
flames, on trains or not. I'm too jealous.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>with a shudder of disgust</i>) Of that pig? (<i>He
drinks his whiskey as if to wash a bad taste from his mouth--then
takes one of her hands in both of his--simply</i>) You're a fool
to be jealous of anyone. You're the only woman I care a damn
about.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>deeply stirred, in spite of herself--her voice
trembling</i>) Jim, don't--(<i>forcing a tense little laugh</i>)
All right, I'll try and believe that--for tonight.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>simply</i>) Thanks, Josie. (<i>A pause. He speaks
in a tone of random curiosity.</i>) Why did you say a while ago
I'd be leaving for New York soon?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stiffens--her face hardening</i>) Well, I was
right, wasn't I? (<i>Unconsciously she tries to pull her hand
away.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--Why are you pulling your hand away?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>stops</i>) Was I? (<i>forcing a smile</i>) I
suppose because it seems crazy for you to hold my big ugly paw so
tenderly. But you're welcome to it, if you like.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I do like. It's strong and kind and warm--like you.
(<i>He kisses it.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) Och, for the love of God--! (<i>She
jerks her hand away--then hastily forces a joking tone.</i>)
Wasting kisses on my hand! Sure, even the moon is laughing at
us.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Nuts for the moon! I'd rather have one light on
Broadway than all the moons since Rameses was a pup. (<i>He takes
cigarettes from his pocket and lights one.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her eyes searching his face, lighted up by the
match</i>) You'll be taking a train back to your dear old
Broadway tomorrow night, won't you?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>still holding the burning match, stares at her in
surprise</i>) Tomorrow night? Where did you get that?</p>

<p>JOSIE--A little bird told me.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>blows out the match in a cloud of smoke</i>) You'd
better give that bird the bird. By the end of the week, is the
right dope. Phil got his dates mixed.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>quickly</i>) He didn't tell me. He was too drunk to
remember anything.</p>

<p>TYRONE--He was sober when I told him. I called up the
executors when we reached the Inn after leaving here. They said
the estate would be out of probate within a few days. I told Phil
the glad tidings and bought drinks for all and sundry. There was
quite a celebration. Funny, Phil wouldn't remember that.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>bewildered--not knowing what to believe</i>) It
is--funny.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>shrugs his shoulders</i>) Well, he's stewed to the
ears. That always explains anything. (<i>then strangely</i>) Only
sometimes it doesn't.</p>

<p>JOSIE--No--sometimes it doesn't.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>goes on without real interest, talking to keep
from thinking</i>) Phil certainly has a prize bun on tonight. He
never took a punch at me before. And that drivel he talked about
owing me one--What got into his head, I wonder.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) How would I know, if you don't?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Well, I don't. Not unless--I remember I did try to get
his goat. Simpson sat down with us. Harder sent him to see me.
You remember after Harder left here I said the joke was on you,
that you'd made this place a gold mine. I was kidding, but I had
the right dope. What do you think he told Simpson to offer? Ten
grand! On the level, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tense</i>) So you accepted?</p>

<p>TYRONE--I told Simpson to tell Harder I did. I decided the
best way to fix him was to let him think he'd got away with it,
and then when he comes tomorrow morning to drive me to the
executor's office, I'll tell him what he can do with himself, his
bankroll, and tin oil tanks.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>knows he is telling the truth--so relieved she can
only stammer stupidly</i>) So that's--the truth of it.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>smiles</i>) Of course, I did it to kid Phil, too.
He was right there, listening. But I know I didn't fool him.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>weakly</i>) Maybe you did fool him, for once. But I
don't know.</p>

<p>TYRONE--And that's why he took a swing at me? (<i>He laughs,
but there is a forced note to it.</i>) Well, if so, it's one hell
of a joke on him. (<i>His tone becomes hurt and bitter.</i>) All
the same, I'll be good and sore, Josie. I promised this place
wouldn't be sold except to him. What the hell does he think I am?
He ought to know I wouldn't double-cross you and him for ten
million!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>giving away at last to her relief and joy</i>)
Don't I know! Oh, Jim, darling! (<i>She hugs him passionately and
kisses</i> <i>him on the lips.</i>) I knew you'd never--I told
him--(<i>She kisses him again.</i>) Oh, Jim, I love you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>again with a strange, simple gratitude</i>)
Thanks, Josie. I mean, for not believing I'm a rotten louse.
Everyone else believes it--including myself--for a damned good
reason. (<i>abruptly changing the subject</i>) I'm a fool to let
this stuff about Phil get under my skin, but--Why, I remember
telling him tonight I'd even written my brother and got his okay
on selling the farm to him. And Phil thanked me. He seemed
touched and grateful. You wouldn't think he'd forget that.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her face hard and bitter</i>) I wouldn't, indeed.
There's a lot of things he'll have to explain when he comes at
sun--(<i>hastily</i>) When he comes back. (<i>She pauses--then
bursts out</i>) The damned old schemer, I'll teach him
to--(<i>again checking herself</i>) to act like a fool.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>smiles</i>) You'll get out the old club, eh? What
a bluff you are, Josie. (<i>teasingly</i>) You and your lovers,
Messalina--when you've never--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with a faint spark of her old defiance</i>) You're
a liar.</p>

<p>TYRONE--"Pride is the sin by which the angels fell." Are you
going to keep that up--with me?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>feebly</i>) You think I've never because no one
would--because I'm a great ugly cow--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>gently</i>) Nuts! You could have had any one of
them. You kidded them till you were sure they wanted you. That
was all you wanted. And then you slapped them groggy when they
tried for more. But you had to keep convincing yourself--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tormentedly</i>) Don't, Jim.</p>

<p>TYRONE--You can take the truth, Josie--from me. Because you
and I belong to the same club. We can kid the world but we can't
fool ourselves, like most people, no matter what we do--nor
escape ourselves no matter where we run away. Whether it's the
bottom of a bottle, or a South Sea Island, we'd find our own
ghosts there waiting to greet us--"sleepless with pale
commemorative eyes," as Rossetti wrote. (<i>He sneers to
himself</i>) The old poetic bull, eh? Crap! (<i>reverting to a
teasing tone</i>) You don't ask how I saw through your bluff,
Josie. You pretend too much. And so do the guys. I've listened to
them at the Inn. They all lie to each other. No one wants to
admit all he got was a slap in the puss, when he thinks a lot of
other guys made it. You can't blame them. And they know you don't
give a damn how they lie. So--</p>

<p>JOSIE--For the love of God, Jim! Don't!</p>

<p>TYRONE--Phil is wise to you, of course, but although he knew I
knew, he would never admit it until tonight.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>startled--vindictively</i>) So he admitted it, did
he? Wait till I get hold of him!</p>

<p>TYRONE--He'll never admit it to you. He's afraid of hurting
you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--He is, is he? Well--(<i>almost hysterically</i>) For
the love of God, can't you shut up about him!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>glances up at her, surprised--then shrugs his
shoulders</i>) Oh, all right. I wanted to clear things up, that's
all--for Phil's sake as well as yours. You have a hell of a
license to be sore. He's the one who ought to be. Don't you
realize what a lousy position you've put him in with your
brazen-trollop act?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) No. He doesn't care, except to use me
in his scheming. He--</p>

<p>TYRONE--Don't be a damned fool. Of course he cares. And so do
I. (<i>He turns and pulls her head down and kisses her on the
lips.</i>) I care, Josie. I love you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with pitiful longing</i>) Do you, Jim? Do you?
(<i>She forces a trembling smile--faintly</i>) Then I'll confess
the truth to you. I've been a crazy fool. I am a virgin. (<i>She
begins to sob with a strange forlorn shame and humiliation.</i>)
And now you'll never--and I want you to--now more than
ever--because I love you more than ever, after what's
happened--(<i>Suddenly she kisses him with fierce passion.</i>)
But you will! I'll make you! To hell with your honorable
scruples! I know you want me! I couldn't believe that until
tonight--but now I know. It's in your kisses! (<i>She kisses him
again--with passionate tenderness</i>) Oh, you great fool! As if
I gave a damn what happened after! I'll have had tonight and your
love to remember for the rest of my days! (<i>She kisses him
again.</i>) Oh, Jim darling, haven't you said yourself there's
only tonight? (<i>She whispers tenderly</i>) Come. Come with me.
(<i>She gets to her feet, pulling at his arm--with a little
self-mocking laugh</i>) But I'll have to make you leave before
sunrise. I mustn't forget that.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>A strange change has come over his face. He looks
her over now with a sneering cynical lust. He speaks thickly as
if he was suddenly very drunk.</i>) Sure thing, Kiddo. What the
hell else do you suppose I came for? I've been kidding myself.
(<i>He steps up beside her and puts his arm around her and
presses his body to hers.</i>) You're the goods, Kid. I've wanted
you all along. Love, nuts! I'll show you what love is. I know
what you want, Bright Eyes. (<i>She is staring at him now with a
look of frightened horror. He kisses her roughly.</i>) Come on,
Baby Doll, let's hit the hay. (<i>He pushes her back in the
doorway.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>strickenly</i>) Jim! Don't! (<i>She pulls his arms
away so violently that he staggers back and would fall down the
steps if she didn't grab his arm in time. As it is he goes down
on one knee. She is on the verge of collapse
herself--brokenly</i>) Jim! I'm not a whore.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>remains on one knee--confusedly, as if he didn't
know what had happened</i>) What the hell? Was I trying to rape
you, Josie? Forget it. I'm drunk--not responsible. (<i>He gets to
his feet, staggering a bit, and steps down to the
ground.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>covering her face with her hands</i>) Oh, Jim!
(<i>She sobs.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>with vague pity</i>) Don't cry. No harm done. You
stopped me, didn't you? (<i>She continues to sob. He mutters
vaguely, as if talking to himself</i>) Must have drawn a blank
for a while. Nuts! Cut out the faking. I knew what I was doing.
(<i>slowly, staring before him</i>) But it's funny. I <i>was</i>
seeing things. That's the truth, Josie. For a moment I thought
you were that blonde pig--(<i>hastily</i>) The old
heebie-jeebies. Hair of the dog. (<i>He gropes around for the
bottle and his glass.</i>) I'll have another shot--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>takes her hands from her face--fiercely</i>) Pour
the whole bottle down your throat, if you like! Only stop
talking! (<i>She covers her face with her hands and sobs
again.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>stares at her with a hurt and sad
expression--dully</i>) Can't forgive me, eh? You ought to. You
ought to thank me for letting you see--(<i>He pauses, as if
waiting for her to say something but she remains silent. He
shrugs his shoulders, pours out a big drink mechanically.</i>)
Well, here's how. (<i>He drinks and puts the bottle and glass on
the ground--dully</i>) That was a nightcap. Our moonlight romance
seems to be a flop, Josie. I guess I'd better go.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>dully</i>) Yes. You'd better go. Good night.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Not good night. Good-bye.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>lifts her head</i>) Good-bye?</p>

<p>TYRONE--Yes. I won't see you again before I leave for New
York. I was a damned fool to come tonight. I hoped--But you don't
get it. How could you? So what's the good--(<i>He shrugs his
shoulders hopelessly and turns toward the road.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Jim!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>turning back--bitter accusation in his tone
now</i>) Whore? Who said you were a whore? But I warned you,
didn't I, if you kept on--Why did you have to act like one,
asking me to come to bed? That wasn't what I came here for. And
you promised tonight would be different. Why the hell did you
promise that, if all you wanted was what all the others want, if
that's all love means to you? (<i>then guiltily</i>) Oh, Christ,
I don't mean that, Josie. I know how you feel, and if I could
give you happiness--But it wouldn't work. You don't know me. I'd
poison it for myself and for you. I've poisoned it already,
haven't I, but it would be a million times worse after--No matter
how I tried not to, I'd make it like all the other nights--for
you, too. You'd lie awake and watch the dawn come with disgust,
with nausea retching your memory, and the wine of passion poets
blab about, a sour aftertaste in your mouth of Dago red ink!
(<i>He gives a sneering laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>distractedly</i>) Oh, Jim, don't! Please don't!</p>

<p>TYRONE--You'd hate me and yourself--not for a day or two but
for the rest of your life. (<i>with a perverse, jeering note of
vindictive boastfulness in his tone</i>) Believe me, Kid, when I
poison them, they stay poisoned!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with dull bitterness</i>) Good-bye, Jim.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>miserably hurt and sad for a
second--appealingly</i>) Josie--(<i>gives the characteristic
shrug of his shoulders--simply</i>) Good-bye. (<i>He turns toward
the road--bitterly</i>) I'll find it hard to forgive, too. I came
here asking for love--just for this one night, because I thought
you loved me. (<i>dully</i>) Nuts. To hell with it. (<i>He starts
away.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>watches him for a second, fighting the love that,
in</i> s<i>pite of her, responds to his appeal--then she springs
up and runs to him--with fierce, possessive, maternal
tenderness</i>) Come here to me, you great fool, and stop your
silly blather. There's nothing to hate you for. There's nothing
to forgive. Sure, I was only trying to give you happiness,
because I love you. I'm sorry I was so stupid and didn't see--But
I see now, and you'll find I have all the love you need. (<i>She
gives him a hug and kisses him. There is passion in her kiss but
it is a tender, protective maternal passion, which he responds to
with an instant grateful yielding.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>simply</i>) Thanks, Josie. You're beautiful. I
love you. I knew you'd understand.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Of course I do. Come, now. (<i>She leads him back, her
arm around his waist.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--I didn't want to leave you. You know that.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Indeed I know it. Come now. We'll sit down. (<i>She
sits on the top step and pulls him down on the step below
her.</i>) That's it--with my arm around you. Now lay your head on
my breast--the way you said you wanted to do--(<i>He lets his
head fall back on her breast. She hugs him--gently</i>) There,
now. Forget all about my being a fool and forgive--(<i>Her voice
trembles--but she goes on determinedly.</i>) Forgive my
selfishness, thinking only of myself. Sure, if there's one thing
I owe you tonight, after all my lying and scheming, it's to give
you the love you need, and it'll be my pride and my
joy--(<i>forcing a trembling echo of her playful tone</i>) It's
easy enough, too, for I have all kinds of love for you--and maybe
this is the greatest of all--because it costs so much. (<i>She
pauses, looking down at his face. He has closed his eyes and his
haggard, dissipated face looks like a pale mask in the
moonlight--at peace as a death mask is at peace. She becomes
frightened.</i>) Jim! Don't look like that!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>opens his eyes--vaguely</i>) Like what?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>quickly</i>) It's the moonlight. It makes you look
so pale, and with your eyes closed--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>simply</i>) You mean I looked dead?</p>

<p>JOSIE--No! As if you'd fallen asleep.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>speaks in a tired, empty tone, as if he felt he
ought to explain something to her</i><b>--</b><i>something which
no longer interests him</i>) Listen, and I'll tell you a little
story, Josie. All my life I had just one dream. From the time I
was a kid, I loved race-horses. I thought they were the most
beautiful things in the world. I liked to gamble, too. So the big
dream was that some day I'd have enough dough to play a cagey
system of betting on favorites, and follow the horses south in
the winter, and come back north with them in the spring, and be
at the track every day. It seemed that would be the ideal
life--for me. (<i>He pauses.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--Well, you'll be able to do it.</p>

<p>TYRONE--No. I won't be able to do it, Josie. That's the joke.
I gave it a try-out before I came up here. I borrowed some money
on my share of the estate, and started going to tracks. But it
didn't work. I played my system, but I found I didn't care if I
won or lost. The horses were beautiful, but I found myself saying
to myself, what of it? Their beauty didn't mean anything. I found
that every day I was glad when the last race was over, and I
could go back to the hotel--and the bottle in my room. (<i>He
pauses, staring into the moonlight with vacant eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>uneasily</i>) Why did you tell me this?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>in the same listless monotone</i>) You said I
looked dead. Well, I am.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You're not! (<i>She hugs him protectively.</i>) Don't
talk like that!</p>

<p>TYRONE--Ever since Mama died.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>deeply moved--pityingly</i>) I know. I've felt all
along it was that sorrow was making you--(<i>She
pauses--gently</i>) Maybe if you talked about your grief for her,
it would help you. I think it must be all choked up inside you,
killing you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>in a strange warning tone</i>) You'd better look
out, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Why?</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>quickly, forcing his cynical smile</i>) I might
develop a crying jag, and sob on your beautiful breast.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>gently</i>) You can sob all you like.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Don't encourage me. You'd be sorry. (<i>A deep
conflict shows in his expression and tone. He is driven to go on
in spite of himself.</i>) But if you're such a glutton for
punishment--After all, I said I'd tell you later, didn't I?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>puzzled</i>) You said you'd tell me about the
blonde on the train.</p>

<p>TYRONE--She's part of it. I lied about that. (<i>He
pauses--then blurts out sneeringly</i>) You won't believe it
could have happened. Or if you did believe, you couldn't
understand or forgive--(<i>quickly</i>) But you might. You're the
one person who might. Because you really love me. And because
you're the only woman I've ever met who understands the lousy
rotten things a man can do when he's crazy drunk, and draws a
blank--especially when he's nutty with grief to start with.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>hugging him tenderly</i>) Of course I'll
understand, Jim, darling.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>stares into the moonlight--hauntedly</i>) But I
didn't draw a blank. I tried to. I drank enough to knock out ten
men. But it didn't work. I knew what I was doing. (<i>He
pauses--dully</i>) No, I can't tell you, Josie. You'd loathe my
guts, and I couldn't blame you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--No! I'll love you no matter what--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>with strange triumphant harshness</i>) All right!
Remember that's a promise! (<i>He pauses--starts to speak--pauses
again.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>pityingly</i>) Maybe you'd better not--if it will
make you suffer.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Trying to welch now, eh? It's too late. You've got me
started. Suffer? Christ, I ought to suffer! (<i>He pauses. Then
he closes his eyes. It is as if he had to hide from sight before
he can begin. He makes his face expressionless. His voice becomes
impersonal and objective, as though what he told concerned some
man he had known, but had nothing to do with him. This is the
only way he can start telling the story.</i>) When Mama died, I'd
been on the wagon for nearly two years. Not even a glass of beer.
Honestly. And I know I would have stayed on. For her sake. She
had no one but me. The Old Man was dead. My brother had
married--had a kid--had his own life to live. She'd lost him. She
had only me to attend to things for her and take care of her.
She'd always hated my drinking. So I quit. It made me happy to do
it. For her. Because she was all I had, all I cared about.
Because I loved her. (<i>He pauses.</i>) No one would believe
that now, who knew--But I did.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>gently</i>) I know how much you loved her.</p>

<p>TYRONE--We went out to the Coast to see about selling a piece
of property the Old Man had bought there years ago. And one day
she suddenly became ill. Got rapidly worse. Went into a coma.
Brain tumor. The docs said, no hope. Might never come out of
coma. I went crazy. Couldn't face losing her. The old booze yen
got me. I got drunk and stayed drunk. And I began hoping she'd
never come out of the coma, and see I was drinking again. That
was my excuse, too--that she'd never know. And she never did.
(<i>He pauses--then sneeringly</i>) Nix! Kidding myself again. I
know damned well just before she died she recognized me. She saw
I was drunk. Then she closed her eyes so she couldn't see, and
was glad to die! (<i>He opens his eyes and stares into the
moonlight as if he saw this deathbed scene before him.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>soothingly</i>) Ssshh. You only imagine that
because you feel guilty about drinking.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>as if he hadn't heard, closes his eyes again</i>)
After that, I kept so drunk I did draw a blank most of the time,
but I went through the necessary motions and no one guessed how
drunk--(<i>He pauses.</i>) But there are things I can never
forget--the undertakers, and her body in a coffin with her face
made up. I couldn't hardly recognize her. She looked young and
pretty like someone I remembered meeting long ago. Practically a
stranger. To whom I was a stranger. Cold and indifferent. Not
worried about me any more. Free at last. Free from worry. From
pain. From me. I stood looking down at her, and something
happened to me. I found I couldn't feel anything. I knew I ought
to be heartbroken but I couldn't feel anything. I seemed dead,
too. I knew I ought to cry. Even a crying jag would look better
than just standing there. But I couldn't cry. I cursed to myself,
"You dirty bastard, it's Mama. You loved her, and now she's dead.
She's gone away from you forever. Never, never again--" But it
had no effect. All I did was try to explain to myself, "She's
dead. What does she care now if I cry or not, or what I do? It
doesn't matter a damn to her. She's happy to be where I can't
hurt her ever again. She's rid of me at last. For God's sake,
can't you leave her alone even now? For God's sake, can't you let
her rest in peace?" (<i>He pauses--then sneeringly</i>) But there
were several people around and I knew they expected me to show
something. Once a ham, always a ham! So I put on an act. I
flopped on my knees and hid my face in my hands and faked some
sobs and cried, "Mama! Mama! My dear mother!" But all the time I
kept saying to myself, "You lousy ham! You God-damned lousy ham!
Christ, in a minute you'll start singing 'Mother Macree'!" (<i>He
opens his eyes and gives a tortured, sneering laugh, staring into
the moonlight.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>horrified, but still deeply pitying</i>) Jim!
Don't! It's past. You've punished yourself. And you were drunk.
You didn't mean--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>again closes his eyes</i>) I had to bring her body
East to be buried beside the Old Man. I took a drawing room and
hid in it with a case of booze. She was in her coffin in the
baggage car. No matter how drunk I got, I couldn't forget that
for a minute. I found I couldn't stay alone in the drawing room.
It became haunted. I was going crazy. I had to go out and wander
up and down the train looking for company. I made such a public
nuisance of myself that the conductor threatened if I didn't
quit, he'd keep me locked in the drawing room. But I'd spotted
one passenger who was used to drunks and could pretend to like
them, if there was enough dough in it. She had parlor house
written all over her--a blonde pig who looked more like a whore
than twenty-five whores, with a face like an overgrown doll's and
a come-on smile as cold as a polar bear's feet. I bribed the
porter to take a message to her and that night she sneaked into
my drawing room. She was bound for New York, too. So every
night--for fifty bucks a night--(<i>He opens his eyes and now he
stares torturedly through the moonlight into the drawing
room.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her face full of revulsion--stammers</i>) Oh, how
could you! (<i>Instinctively she draws away, taking her arms from
around him.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--How could I? I don't know. But I did. I suppose I had
some mad idea she could make me forget--what was in the baggage
car ahead.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Don't. (<i>She draws back again so he has to raise his
head from her breast. He doesn't seem to notice this.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--No, it couldn't have been that. Because I didn't seem
to want to forget. It was like some plot I had to carry out. The
blonde--she didn't matter. She was only something that belonged
in the plot. It was as if I wanted revenge--because I'd been left
alone--because I knew I was lost, without any hope left--that all
I could do would be drink myself to death, because no one was
left who could help me. (<i>His face hardens and a look of cruel
vindictiveness comes into it--with a strange horrible
satisfaction in his tone</i>) No, I didn't forget even in that
pig's arms! I remembered the last two lines of a lousy
tear-jerker song I'd heard when I was a kid kept singing over and
over in my brain.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And baby's cries can't waken her<br>
 In the baggage coach ahead."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>distractedly</i>) Jim!</p>

<p>TYRONE--I couldn't stop it singing. I didn't want to stop
it!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Jim! For the love of God. I don't want to hear!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>after a pause--dully</i>) Well, that's all--except
I was too drunk to go to her funeral.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Oh! (<i>She has drawn away from him as far as she can
without getting up. He becomes aware of this for the first time
and turns slowly to stare at her.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>dully</i>) Don't want to touch me now, eh? (<i>He
shrugs his shoulders mechanically.</i>) Sorry. I'm a damned fool.
I shouldn't have told you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her horror ebbing as her love and protective
compassion returns--moves nearer him--haltingly</i>) Don't, Jim.
Don't say--I don't want to touch you. It's--a lie. (<i>She puts a
hand on his shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>as if she hadn't spoken--with hopeless
longing</i>) Wish I could believe in the spiritualists' bunk. If
I could tell her it was because I missed her so much and couldn't
forgive her for leaving me--</p>

<p>JOSIE--Jim! For the love of God--!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>unheeding</i>) She'd understand and forgive me,
don't you think? She always did. She was simple and kind and pure
of heart. She was beautiful. You're like her deep in your heart.
That's why I told you. I thought--(<i>Abruptly his expression
becomes sneering and cynical--harshly</i>) My mistake. Nuts!
Forget it. Time I got a move on. I don't like your damned moon,
Josie. It's an ad for the past. (<i>He recites mockingly</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is the very error of the moon:<br>
 She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,<br>
 And makes men mad."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>(<i>He moves.</i>) I'll grab the last trolley for town.
There'll be a speak open, and some drunk laughing. I need a
laugh. (<i>He starts to get up.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>throws her arms around him and pulls him
back--tensely</i>) No! You won't go! I won't let you! (<i>She
hugs him close--gently</i>) I understand now, Jim, darling, and
I'm proud you came to me as the one in the world you know loves
you enough to understand and forgive--and I do forgive!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>lets his head fall back on her breast--simply</i>)
Thanks, Josie. I knew you--</p>

<p>JOSIE--As <i>she</i> forgives, do you hear me! As <i>she</i>
loves and understands and forgives!</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>simply</i>) Yes, I know she--(<i>His voice
breaks.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>bends over him with a brooding maternal
tenderness</i>) That's right. Do what you came for, my darling.
It isn't drunken laughter in a speakeasy you want to hear at all,
but the sound of yourself crying your heart's repentance against
her breast. (<i>His face is convulsed. He hides it on her breast
and sobs rackingly. She hugs him more tightly and speaks softly,
staring into the moonlight.</i>) <i>She</i> hears. I feel her in
the moonlight, her soul wrapped in it like a silver mantle, and I
know she understands and forgives me, too, and her blessing lies
on me. (<i>A pause. His sobs begin to stop exhaustedly. She looks
down at him again and speaks soothingly as she would to a
child.</i>) There. There, now. (<i>He stops. She goes on in a
gentle, bullying tone.</i>) You're a fine one, wanting to leave
me when the night I promised I'd give you has just begun, our
night that'll be different from all the others, with a dawn that
won't creep over dirty windowpanes but will wake in the sky like
a promise of God's peace in the soul's dark sadness. (<i>She
smiles a little amused smile.</i>) Will you listen to me, Jim! I
must be a poet. Who would have guessed it? Sure, love is a
wonderful mad inspiration! (<i>A pause. She looks down. His eyes
are closed. His face against her breast looks pale and haggard in
the moonlight. Calm with the drained, exhausted peace of death.
For a second she is frightened. Then she realizes and whispers
softly</i>) Asleep. (<i>in a tender crooning tone like a
lullaby</i>) That's right. Sleep in peace, my darling. (<i>then
with sudden anguished longing</i>) Oh, Jim, Jim, maybe my love
could still save you, if you could want it enough! (<i>She shakes
her head.</i>) No. That can never be. (<i>Her eyes leave his face
to stare up at the sky. She looks weary and stricken and sad. She
forces a defensive, self-derisive smile.</i>) God forgive me,
it's a fine end to all my scheming, to sit here with the dead
hugged to my breast, and the silly mug of the moon grinning down,
enjoying the joke!</p>

<h1><a name="a04">ACT FOUR</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Same as Act Three. It is dawn. The first faint
streaks of color, heralding the sunrise, appear in the eastern
sky at left.</i></p>

<p><i>Josie sits in the same position on the steps, as if she had
not moved, her arms around Tyrone. He is still asleep, his head
on her breast. His face has the same exhausted, death-like
repose. Josie's face is set in an expression of numbed, resigned
sadness. Her body sags tiredly. In spite of her strength, holding
herself like this for hours, for fear of waking him, is becoming
too much for her.</i></p>

<p><i>The two make a strangely tragic picture in the wan dawn
light--this big sorrowful woman hugging a haggard-faced,
middle-aged drunkard against her breast, as if he were a sick
child.</i></p>

<p><i>Hogan appears at left-rear, coming from the barn. He
approaches the corner of the house stealthily on tiptoe. Wisps of
hay stick to his clothes and his face is swollen and sleepy, but
his little pig's eyes are sharply wide awake and sober. He peek
around the corner, and takes in the two on the steps. His eyes
fix on Josie's face in a long, probing stare.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>speaks in a low grim tone</i>) Stop hiding, Father.
I heard you sneak up. (<i>He comes guiltily around the corner.
She keeps her voice low, but her tone is commanding.</i>) Come
here, and be quiet about it. (<i>He obeys meekly, coming as far
as the boulder silently, his eyes searching her face, his
expression becoming guilty and miserable at what he sees. She
goes on in the same tone, without looking at him.</i>) Talk low,
now. I don't want him wakened--(<i>She adds strangely</i>) Not
until the dawn has beauty in it.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>worriedly</i>) What? (<i>He decides it's better for
the present to ask no questions. His eyes fall on Tyrone's face.
In spite of himself, he is startled--in an awed, almost
frightened whisper</i>) Be God, he looks dead!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>strangely</i>) Why wouldn't he? He is.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Is?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Don't be a fool. Can't you see him breathing? Dead
asleep, I mean. Don't stand there gawking. Sit down. (<i>He sits
meekly on the boulder. His face betrays a guilty dread of what is
coming. There is a pause in which she doesn't look at him,</i>
<i>but he keeps glancing at her, growing visibly more uneasy. She
speaks bitterly.</i>) Where's your witnesses?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>guiltily</i>) Witnesses? (<i>then forcing an amused
grin</i>) Oh, be God, if that ain't a joke on me! Sure, I got so
blind drunk at the Inn I forgot all about our scheme and came
home and went to sleep in the hayloft.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her expression harder and more bitter</i>) You're a
liar.</p>

<p>HOGAN--I'm not. I just woke up. Look at the hay sticking to
me. That's proof.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'm not thinking of that, and well you know it.
(<i>with bitter voice</i>) So you just woke up--did you?--and
then came sneaking here to see if the scheme behind your scheme
had worked!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>guiltily</i>) I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Don't lie any more, Father. This time, you've told one
too many. (<i>He starts to defend himself but the look on her
face makes him think better of it and he remains uneasily silent.
A pause.</i>)</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>finally has to blurt out</i>) Sure, if I'd brought
the witnesses, there's nothing for them to witness that--</p>

<p>JOSIE--No. You're right, there. There's nothing. Nothing at
all. (<i>She smiles strangely.</i>) Except a great miracle they'd
never believe, or you either.</p>

<p>HOGAN--What miracle?</p>

<p>JOSIE--A virgin who bears a dead child in the night, and the
dawn finds her still a virgin. If that isn't a miracle, what
is?</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>uneasily</i>) Stop talking so queer. You give me
the shivers. (<i>He attempts a joking tone.</i>) Is it you who's
the virgin? Faith, that <i>would</i> be a miracle, no less!
(<i>He forces a chuckle.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--I told you to stop lying, Father.</p>

<p>HOGAN--What lie? (<i>He stops and watches her face worriedly.
She is silent, as if she were not aware of him now. Her eyes are
fixed on the wanton sky.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>as if to herself</i>) It'll be beautiful soon, and
I can wake him.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>can't retain his anxiety any longer</i>) Josie,
darlin'! For the love of God, can't you tell me what happened to
you?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her face hard and bitter again</i>) I've told you
once. Nothing.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Nothing? If you could see the sadness in your
face--</p>

<p>JOSIE--What woman doesn't sorrow for the man she loved who has
died? But there's pride in my heart, too.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>tormentedly</i>) Will you stop talking as if you'd
gone mad in the night! (<i>raising his voice--with revengeful
anger</i>) Listen to me! If Jim Tyrone has done anything to bring
you sorrow--(<i>Tyrone stirs in his sleep and moans, pressing his
face against her breast as if for protection. She looks down at
him and hugs him close.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>croons softly</i>) There, there, my darling. Rest
in peace a while longer. (<i>turns on her father angrily and
whispers</i>) Didn't I tell you to speak low and not wake him!
(<i>She pauses--then quietly</i>) He did nothing to bring me
sorrow. It was my mistake. I thought there was still hope. I
didn't know he'd died already--that it was a damned soul coming
to me in the moonlight, to confess and be forgiven and find peace
for a night--</p>

<p>HOGAN--Josie! Will you stop!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>after a pause--dully</i>) He'd never do anything to
hurt me. You know it. (<i>self-mockingly</i>) Sure, hasn't he
told me I'm beautiful to him and he loves me--in his fashion.
(<i>then matter-of-factly</i>) All that happened was that he got
drunk and he had one of his crazy notions he wanted to sleep the
way he is, and I let him sleep. (<i>with forced roughness</i>)
And, be God, the night's over. I'm half dead with tiredness and
sleepiness. It's that you see in my face, not sorrow.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Don't try to fool me, Josie. I--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her face hard and bitter--grimly</i>) Fool you, is
it? It's you who made a fool of me with your lies, thinking you'd
use me to get your dirty greasy paws on the money he'll have!</p>

<p>HOGAN--No! I swear by all the saints--</p>

<p>JOSIE--You'd swear on a Bible while you were stealing it!
(<i>grimly</i>) Listen to me, Father. I didn't call you here to
answer questions about what's none of your business. I called you
here to tell you I've seen through all the lies you told last
night to get me to--(<i>as he starts to speak</i>) Shut up! I'll
do the talking now. You weren't drunk. You were only putting it
on as part of your scheme--</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>quietly</i>) I wasn't drunk, no. I admit that,
Josie. But I'd had slews of drinks and they were in my head or
I'd never have the crazy dreams--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with biting scorn</i>) Dreams, is it? The only
dream you've ever had, or will have, is of yourself counting a
fistful of dirty money, and divil a care how you got it, or who
you robbed or made suffer!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>winces--pleadingly</i>) Josie!</p>

<p>JOSIE--Shut up. (<i>scathingly</i>) I'm sure you've made up a
whole new set of lies and excuses. You're that cunning and
clever, but you can save your breath. They wouldn't fool me now.
I've been fooled once too often. (<i>He gives her a frightened
look, as if something he had dreaded has happened. She goes on,
grimly accusing.</i>) You lied about Jim selling the farm. You
knew he was kidding. You knew the estate would be out of probate
in a few days, and he'd go back to Broadway, and you had to do
something quick or you'd lose the last chance of getting your
greedy hooks on his money.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>miserably</i>) No. It wasn't that, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You saw how hurt and angry I was because he'd kept me
waiting here, and you used that. You knew I loved him and wanted
him and you used that. You used all you knew about me--Oh, you
did it clever! You ought to be proud! You worked it so it was me
who did all the dirty scheming--You knew I'd find out from Jim
you'd lied about the farm, but not before your lie had done its
work--made me go after him, get him drunk, get drunk myself so I
could be shameless--and when the truth did come out, wouldn't it
make me love him all the more and be more shameless and willing?
Don't tell me you didn't count on that, and you such a clever
schemer! And if he once had me, knowing I was a virgin, didn't
you count on his honor and remorse, and his loving me in his
fashion, to make him offer to marry me? Sure, why wouldn't he,
you thought. It wouldn't hold him. He'd go back to Broadway just
the same and never see me again. But there'd be money in it, and
when he'd finished killing himself, I'd be his legal widow and
get what's left.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>miserably</i>) No! It wasn't that.</p>

<p>JOSIE--But what's the good of talking? It's all over. I've
only one more word for you, Father, and it's this: I'm leaving
you today, like my brothers left. You can live alone and work
alone your cunning schemes on yourself.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>after a pause--slowly</i>) I knew you'd be bitter
against me, Josie, but I took the chance you'd be so happy you
wouldn't care how--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>as if she hadn't heard, looking at the eastern sky
which is now glowing with color</i>) Thank God, it's beautiful.
It's time. (<i>to Hogan</i>) Go in the house and stay there till
he's gone. I don't want you around to start some new scheme.
(<i>He looks miserable, starts to speak, thinks better of it, and
meekly tiptoes past her up the steps and goes in, closing the
door quietly after him. She looks down at Tyrone. Her face
softens with a maternal tenderness--sadly</i>) I hate to bring
you back to life, Jim, darling. If you could have died in your
sleep, that's what you would have liked, isn't it? (<i>She gives
him a gentle shake.</i>) Wake up, Jim. (<i>He moans in his sleep
and presses more closely against her. She stares at his
face.</i>) Dear God, let him remember that one thing and forget
the rest. That will be enough for me. (<i>She gives him a more
vigorous shake.</i>) Jim! Wake up, do you hear? It's time.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>half wakens without opening his eyes--mutters</i>)
What the hell? (<i>dimly conscious of a woman's
body--cynically</i>) Again, eh? Same old stuff. Who the hell are
you, sweetheart? (<i>irritably</i>) What's the big idea, waking
me up? What time is it?</p>

<p>JOSIE--It's dawn.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>still without opening his eyes</i>) Dawn? (<i>He
quotes drowsily</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,<br>
 When I awoke and found the dawn was gray."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>(<i>then with a sneer</i>) They're all gray. Go to sleep,
Kid--and let me sleep. (<i>He falls asleep again.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) This one isn't gray, Jim. It's
different from all the others--(<i>She sees he is
asleep--bitterly</i>) He'll have forgotten. He'll never notice.
And I'm the whore on the train to him now, not--(<i>Suddenly she
pushes him away from her and shakes him roughly.</i>) Will you
wake up, for God's sake! I've had all I can bear--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>still half asleep</i>) Hey! Cut out the rough
stuff, Kid. What? (<i>awake now, blinking his eyes--with dazed
surprise</i>) Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>still bitter</i>) That's who, and none of your
damned tarts! (<i>She pushes him.</i>) Get up now, so you won't
fall asleep again. (<i>He does so with difficulty, still in a
sleepy daze, his body stiff and cramped. She conquers her bitter
resentment and puts on her old free-and-easy kidding tone with
him, but all the time waiting to see how much he will
remember.</i>) You're stiff and cramped, and no wonder. I'm worse
from holding you, if that's any comfort. (<i>She stretches and
rubs her numbed arms, groaning comically.</i>) Holy Joseph, I'm a
wreck entirely. I'll never be the same. (<i>giving him a quick
glance</i>) You look as if you'd drawn a blank and were wondering
how you got here. I'll bet you don't remember a thing.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>moving his arms and legs gingerly--sleepily</i>) I
don't know. Wait till I'm sure I'm still alive.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You need an eye-opener. (<i>She picks up the bottle and
glass and pours him a drink.</i>) Here you are.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>takes the glass mechanically</i>) Thanks, Josie.
(<i>He goes and sits on the boulder, holding the drink as if he
had no interest in it.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>watching him</i>) Drink up or you'll be asleep
again.</p>

<p>TYRONE--No, I'm awake now, Josie. Funny. Don't seem to want a
drink. Oh, I've got a head all right. But no
heebie-jeebies--yet.</p>

<p>JOSIE--That's fine. It must be a pleasant change--</p>

<p>TYRONE--It is. I've got a nice, dreamy peaceful hangover for
once--as if I'd had a sound sleep without nightmares.</p>

<p>JOSIE--So you did. Divil a nightmare. I ought to know. Wasn't
I holding you and keeping them away?</p>

<p>TYRONE--You mean you--(<i>suddenly</i>) Wait a minute. I
remember now I was sitting alone at a table in the Inn, and I
suddenly had a crazy notion I'd come up here and sleep with my
head on your--So that's why I woke up in your arms.
(<i>shamefacedly</i>) And you let me get away with it. You're a
nut, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Oh, I didn't mind.</p>

<p>TYRONE--You must have seen how blotto I was, didn't you?</p>

<p>JOSIE--I did. You were as full as a tick.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Then why didn't you give me the bum's rush?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Why would I? I was glad to humor you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--For God's sake, how long was I cramped on you like
that?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Oh, a few hours, only.</p>

<p>TYRONE--God, I'm sorry Josie, but it's your own fault for
letting me--</p>

<p>JOSIE--Och, don't be apologizing. I was glad of the excuse to
stay awake and enjoy the beauty of the moon.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Yes, I can remember what a beautiful night it was.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Can you? I'm glad of that, Jim. You seemed to enjoy it
the while we were sitting here together before you fell
asleep.</p>

<p>TYRONE--How long a while was that?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Not long. Less than an hour, anyway.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I suppose I bored the hell out of you with a lot of
drunken drivel.</p>

<p>JOSIE--Not a lot, no. But some. You were full of blarney,
saying how beautiful I was to you.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>earnestly</i>) That wasn't drivel, Josie. You
were. You are. You always will be.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You're a wonder, Jim. Nothing can stop you, can it?
Even me in the light of dawn, looking like something you'd put in
the field to scare the crows from the corn. You'll kid at the Day
of Judgment.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>impatiently</i>) You know damned well it isn't
kidding. You're not a fool. You can tell.</p>

<p>JOSIE<i>--</i>(<i>kiddingly</i>) All right, then, I'm
beautiful and you love me--in your fashion.</p>

<p>TYRONE--"In my fashion," eh? Was I reciting poetry to you?
That must have been hard to take.</p>

<p>JOSIE--It wasn't. I liked it. It was all about beautiful
nights and the romance of the moon.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Well, there was some excuse for that, anyway. It sure
was a beautiful night. I'll never forget it.</p>

<p>JOSIE--I'm glad, Jim.</p>

<p>TYRONE--What other bunk did I pull on you--or I mean, did old
John Barleycorn pull?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Not much. You were mostly quiet and sad--in a kind of
daze, as if the moon was in your wits as well as whiskey.</p>

<p>TYRONE--I remember I was having a grand time at the Inn,
celebrating with Phil, and then suddenly, for no reason, all the
fun went out of it, and I was more melancholy than ten Hamlets.
(<i>He pauses.</i>) Hope I didn't tell you the sad story of my
life and weep on your bosom, Josie.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You didn't. The one thing you talked a lot about was
that you wanted the night with me to be different from all the
other nights you'd spent with women.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>with revulsion</i>) God, don't make me think of
those tramps now! (<i>then with deep, grateful feeling</i>) It
sure was different, Josie. I may not remember much, but I know
how different it was from the way I feel now. None of my usual
morning-after stuff--the damned sick remorse that makes you wish
you'd died in your sleep so you wouldn't have to face the rotten
things you're afraid you said and did the night before, when you
were so drunk you didn't know what you were doing.</p>

<p>JOSIE--There's nothing you said or did last night for you to
regret. You can take my word for it.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>as if he hadn't heard--slowly</i>) It's hard to
describe how I feel. It's a new one on me. Sort of at peace with
myself and this lousy life--as if all my sins had been
forgiven--(<i>He becomes self-conscious--cynically</i>) Nuts with
that sin bunk, but you know what I mean.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>tensely</i>) I do, and I'm happy you feel that way,
Jim. (<i>A pause. She goes on.</i>) You talked about how you'd
watched too many dawns come creeping grayly over dirty
windowpanes, with some tart snoring beside you--</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>winces</i>) Have a heart. Don't remind me of that
now, Josie. Don't spoil this dawn! (<i>A pause. She watches him
tensely. He turns slowly to face the east, where the sky is now
glowing with all the colors of an exceptionally beautiful
sunrise. He stares, drawing a deep breath. He is profoundly moved
but immediately becomes self-conscious and tries to sneer it
off--cynically</i>) God seems to be putting on quite a display. I
like Belasco better. Rise of curtain, Act-Four stuff. (<i>Her
face has fallen into lines of bitter hurt, but he adds quickly
and angrily</i>) God damn it! Why do I have to pull that lousy
stuff? (<i>with genuine deep feeling</i>) God, it's beautiful,
Josie! I--I'll never forget it--here with you.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her face clearing--simply</i>) I'm glad, Jim. I was
hoping you'd feel beauty in it--by way of a token.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>watching the sunrise--mechanically</i>) Token of
what?</p>

<p>JOSIE--Oh, I don't know. Token to me that--never mind. I
forget what I meant. (<i>abruptly changing the subject</i>) Don't
think I woke you just to admire the sunrise. You're on a farm,
not Broadway, and it's time for me to start work, not go to bed.
(<i>She gets to her feet and stretches. There is a growing strain
behind her free-and-easy manner.</i>) And that's a hint, Jim. I
can't stay entertaining you. So go back to the Inn, that's a good
boy. I know you'll understand the reason, and not think I'm tired
of your company. (<i>She forces a smile.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>gets up</i>) Of course, I understand. (<i>He
pauses--then blurts out guiltily</i>) One more question. You're
sure I didn't get out of order last night--and try to make you,
or anything like that.</p>

<p>JOSIE--You didn't. You kidded back when I kidded you, the way
we always do. That's all.</p>

<p>TYRONE--Thank God for that. I'd never forgive myself if--I
wouldn't have asked you except I've pulled some pretty rotten
stuff when I was drawing a blank. (<i>He becomes conscious of the
forgotten drink he has in his hand.</i>) Well, I might as well
drink this. The bar at the Inn won't be open for hours. (<i>He
drinks--then looks pleasantly surprised.</i>) I'll be damned!
That isn't Phil's rotgut. That's real, honest-to-God bonded
Bourbon. Where--(<i>This clicks in his mind and suddenly he
remembers everything and Josie sees that he does. The look of
guilt and shame and anguish settles over his face. Instinctively
he throws the glass away, his first reaction one of loathing for
the drink which brought back memory. He feels Josie staring at
him and fights desperately to control his voice and
expression.</i>) Real Bourbon. I remember now you said a
bootlegger gave it to Phil. Well, I'll run along and let you do
your work. See you later, Josie. (<i>He turns toward the
road.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>strickenly</i>) No! Don't, Jim! Don't go like that!
You won't see me later. You'll never see me again now, and I know
that's best for us both, but I can't bear to have you ashamed you
wanted my love to comfort your sorrow--when I'm so proud I could
give it. (<i>pleadingly</i>) I hoped, for your sake, you wouldn't
remember, but now you do, I want you to remember my love for you
gave you peace for a while.</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>stares at her, fighting with himself. He stammers
defensively</i>) I don't know what you're talking about. I don't
remember--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>sadly</i>) All right, Jim. Neither do I then.
Good-bye, and God bless you. (<i>She turns as if to go up the
steps into the house.</i>)</p>

<p>TYRONE--(<i>stammers</i>) Wait, Josie! (<i>coming to her</i>)
I'm a liar! I'm a louse! Forgive me, Josie. I do remember! I'm
glad I remember! I'll never forget your love! (<i>He kisses her
on the lips.</i>) Never! (<i>kissing her again</i>) Never, do you
hear! I'll always love you, Josie. (<i>He kisses her again.</i>)
Good-bye--and God bless you! (<i>He turns away and walks quickly
down the road off left without looking back. She stands, watching
him go, for a moment, then she puts her hands over her face, her
head bent, and sobs. Hogan comes out of her room and stands on
top of the steps. He looks after Tyrone and his face is hard with
bitter anger.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>sensing his presence, stops crying and lifts her
head--dully</i>) I'll get your breakfast in a minute, Father.</p>

<p>HOGAN--To hell with my breakfast! I'm not a pig that has no
other thought but eating! (<i>then pleadingly</i>) Listen,
darlin'. All you said about my lying and scheming, and what I
hoped would happen, is true. But it wasn't his money, Josie. I
did see it was the last chance--the only one left to bring the
two of you to stop your damned pretending, and face the truth
that you loved each other. I wanted you to find happiness--by
hook or crook, one way or another, what did I care how? I wanted
to save him, and I hoped he'd see that only your love could--It
was his talk of the beauty he saw in you that made me hope--And I
knew he'd never go to bed with you even if you'd let him unless
he married you. And if I gave a thought to his money at all, that
was the least of it, and why shouldn't I want to have you live in
ease and comfort for a change, like you deserve, instead of in
this shanty on a lousy farm, slaving for me? (<i>He
pauses--miserably</i>) Can't you believe that's the truth, Josie,
and not feel so bitter against me?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her eyes still following Tyrone--gently</i>) I know
it's the truth, Father. I'm not bitter now. Don't be afraid I'm
going to leave you. I only said it to punish you for a while.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>with humble gratitude</i>) Thank God for that,
darlin'.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>forces a teasing smile and a little of her old
manner</i>) A ginger-haired, crooked old goat like you to be
playing Cupid!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>His face lights up joyfully. He is almost himself
again--ruefully</i>) You had me punished, that's sure. I was
thinking after you'd gone I'd drown myself in Harder's ice pond.
There was this consolation in it, I knew that the bastard would
never look at a piece of ice again without remembering me.
(<i>She doesn't hear this. Her thoughts are on the receding
figure of Tyrone again. Hogan looks at her sad face
worriedly--gently</i>) Don't, darlin'. Don't be hurting yourself.
(<i>Then as she still doesn't hear, he puts on his old, fuming
irascible tone.</i>) Are you going to moon at the sunrise
forever, and me with the sides of my stomach knocking
together?</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>gently</i>) Don't worry about me, Father. It's over
now. I'm not hurt. I'm only sad for him.</p>

<p>HOGAN--For him? (<i>He bursts out in a fit of smoldering
rage.</i>) May the blackest curse from the pit of hell--</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>with an anguished cry</i>) Don't, Father! I love
him!</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>subsides, but his face looks sorrowful and
old--dully</i>) I didn't mean it. I know whatever happened he
meant no harm to you. It was life I was cursing--(<i>with a trace
of his natural manner</i>) And, be God, that's a waste of breath,
if it does deserve it. (<i>then as she remains
silent--miserably</i>) Or maybe I was cursing myself for a damned
old scheming fool, like I ought to.</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>turns to him, forcing a teasing smile</i>) Look
out. I might say Amen to that. (<i>gently</i>) Don't be sad,
Father. I'm all right--and I'm well content here with you.
(<i>forcing her teasing manner again</i>) Sure, living with you
has spoilt me for any other man, anyway. There'd never be the
same fun or excitement.</p>

<p>HOGAN--(<i>plays up to this--in his fuming manner</i>)
There'll be excitement if I don't get my breakfast soon, but it
won't be fun, I'm warning you!</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>forcing her usual reaction to his threats</i>) Och,
don't be threatening me, you bad-tempered old tick. Let's go in
the house and I'll get your damned breakfast.</p>

<p>HOGAN--Now you're talking. (<i>He goes in the house through
her room. She follows him as far as the door--then turns for a
last look down the road.</i>)</p>

<p>JOSIE--(<i>her face sad, tender and pitying--gently</i>) May
you have your wish and die in your sleep soon, Jim, darling. May
you rest forever in forgiveness and peace. (<i>She turns slowly
and goes into the house.</i>)</p>
