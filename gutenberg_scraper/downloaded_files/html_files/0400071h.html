<h2><a name="s101">SCENE ONE</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>A corner in lower New York, at the edge of a colored
district. Three narrow streets converge. A triangular building in
the rear, red brick, four-storied, its ground floor a grocery.
Four-story tenements stretch away down the skyline of the two
streets. The fire escapes are crowded with people. In the street
leading left, the faces are all white; in the street leading
right, all black. It is hot Spring. On the sidewalk are eight
children, four boys and four girls. Two of each sex are white,
two black. They are playing marbles. One of the black boys is Jim
Harris. The little blonde girl, her complexion rose and white,
who sits behind his elbow and holds his marbles is Ella Downey.
She is eight. They play the game with concentrated attention for
a while. People pass, black and white, the Negroes frankly
participants in the spirit of Spring, the whites laughing
constrainedly, awkward in natural emotion. Their words are lost.
One hears only their laughter. It expresses the difference in
race. There are street noises--the clattering roar of the
Elevated, the puff of its locomotives, the ruminative lazy sound
of a horse-car, the hooves of its team clacking on the cobbles.
From the street of the whites a high-pitched, nasal tenor sings
the chorus of "Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage." On the street of
the blacks a Negro strikes up the chorus of: "I Guess I'll Have
to Telegraph My Baby." As this singing ends, there is laughter,
distinctive in quality, from both streets. Then silence. The
light in the street begins to grow brilliant with the glow of the
setting sun. The game of marbles goes on.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>WHITE GIRL--(<i>tugging at the elbow of her brother</i>) Come
on, Mickey!</p>

<p>HER BROTHER--(<i>roughly</i>) Aw, gwan, youse!</p>

<p>WHITE GIRL--Aw right, den. You kin git a lickin' if you
wanter. (<i>gets up to move off</i>)</p>

<p>HER BROTHER--Aw, git off de eart'!</p>

<p>WHITE GIRL--De old woman'll be madder'n hell!</p>

<p>HER BROTHER--(<i>worried now</i>) I'm comin', ain't I? Hold
your horses.</p>

<p>BLACK GIRL--(<i>to a black boy</i>) Come on, you Joe. We gwine
git frailed too, you don't hurry.</p>

<p>JOE--Go long!</p>

<p>MICKEY--Bust up de game, huh? I gotta run! (<i>jumps to his
feet</i>)</p>

<p>OTHER WHITE BOY--Me, too! (<i>jumps up</i>)</p>

<p>OTHER BLACK GIRL--Lawdy, it's late!</p>

<p>JOE--Me for grub!</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>to Jim Harris</i>) You's de winner, Jim Crow. Yeh
gotta play tomorrer.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>readily</i>) Sure t'ing, Mick. Come one, come all!
(<i>He laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>OTHER WHITE BOY--Me, too! I gotta git back at yuh.</p>

<p>JIM--Aw right, Shorty.</p>

<p>LITTLE GIRLS--Hurry! Come on, come on! (<i>The six start off
together. Then they notice that Jim and Ella are hesitating,
standing awkwardly and shyly together. They turn to
mock.</i>)</p>

<p>JOE--Look at dat Jim Crow! Land sakes, he got a gal! (<i>He
laughs. They all laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>ashamed</i>) Ne'er mind, you Chocolate!</p>

<p>MICKEY--Look at de two softies, will yeh! Mush! Mush! (<i>He
and the two other boys take this up.</i>)</p>

<p>LITTLE GIRLS--(<i>pointing their fingers at Ella</i>) Shame!
Shame! Everybody knows your name! Painty Face! Painty Face!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>hanging her head</i>) Shut up!</p>

<p>LITTLE WHITE GIRL--He's been carrying her books!</p>

<p>COLORED GIRL--Can't you find nuffin' better'n him, Ella? Look
at de big feet he got! (<i>She laughs. They all laugh. Jim puts
one foot on top of the other, looking at Ella.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--Mind yer own business, see! (<i>She strides toward them
angrily. They jump up and dance in an ecstasy, screaming and
laughing.</i>)</p>

<p>ALL--Found yeh out! Found yeh out!</p>

<p>MICKEY--Mush-head! Jim Crow de Sissy! Stuck on Painty
Face!</p>

<p>JOE--Will Painty Face let you hold her doll, boy?</p>

<p>SHORTY--Sissy! Softy! (<i>Ella suddenly begins to cry. At this
they all howl.</i>)</p>

<p>ALL--Cry-baby! Cry-baby! Look at her! Painty Face!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>suddenly rushing at them, with clenched fists,
furiously</i>) Shut yo' moufs! I kin lick de hull of you!
(<i>They all run away, laughing, shouting, and jeering, quite
triumphant now that they have made him, too, lose his temper. He
comes back to Ella, and stands beside her sheepishly, stepping on
one foot after the other. Suddenly he blurts out</i>) Don't bawl
no more. I done chased 'em.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>comforted, politely</i>) Tanks.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>swelling out</i>) It was a cinch. I kin wipe up de
street wid any one of dem. (<i>He stretches out his arms, trying
to bulge out his biceps.</i>) Feel dat muscle!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>does so gingerly--then with admiration</i>) My!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>protectingly</i>) You mustn't never be scared when
I'm hanging round, Painty Face.</p>

<p>ELLA--Don't call me that, Jim--please!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>contritely</i>) I didn't mean nuffin'. I didn't know
you'd mind.</p>

<p>ELLA--I do--more'n anything.</p>

<p>JIM--You oughtn't to mind. Dey's jealous, dat's what.</p>

<p>ELLA--Jealous? Of what?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>pointing to her face</i>) Of dat. Red 'n' white. It's
purty.</p>

<p>ELLA--I hate it!</p>

<p>JIM--It's purty. Yes, it's--it's purty. It's--outa sight!</p>

<p>ELLA--I hate it. I wish I was black like you.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>sort of shrinking</i>) No you don't. Dey'd call you
Crow, den--or Chocolate--or Smoke.</p>

<p>ELLA--I wouldn't mind.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>somberly</i>) Dey'd call you nigger sometimes,
too.</p>

<p>ELLA--I wouldn't mind.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>humbly</i>) You wouldn't mind?</p>

<p>ELLA--No, I wouldn't mind. (<i>an awkward pause</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>suddenly</i>) You know what, Ella? Since I been
tuckin' yo' books to school and back, I been drinkin' lots o'
chalk 'n' water tree times a day. Dat Tom, de barber, he tole me
dat make me white, if I drink enough. (<i>pleadingly</i>) Does I
look whiter?</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>comfortingly</i>) Yes--maybe--a little bit--</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>trying a careless tone</i>) Reckon dat Tom's a liar,
an' de joke's on me! Dat chalk only makes me feel kinder sick
inside.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>wonderingly</i>) Why do you want to be white?</p>

<p>JIM--Because--just because--I lak dat better.</p>

<p>ELLA--I wouldn't. I like black. Let's you and me swap. I'd
like to be black. (<i>clapping her hands</i>) Gee, that'd be fun,
if we only could!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>hesitatingly</i>) Yes--maybe--</p>

<p>ELLA--Then they'd call me Crow, and you'd be Painty Face!</p>

<p>JIM--They wouldn't never dast call you nigger, you bet! I'd
kill 'em! (<i>A long pause. Finally she takes his hand shyly.
They both keep looking as far away from each other as
possible.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--I like you.</p>

<p>JIM--I like you.</p>

<p>ELLA--Do you want to be my feller?</p>

<p>JIM--Yes.</p>

<p>ELLA--Then I'm your girl.</p>

<p>JIM--Yes. (<i>then grandly</i>) You kin bet none o' de gang
gwine call you Painty Face from dis out! I lam' 'em good! (<i>The
sun has set. Twilight has fallen on the street. An organ grinder
comes up to the corner and plays "Annie Rooney." They stand
hand-in-hand and listen. He goes away. It is growing
dark.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>suddenly</i>) Golly, it's late! I'll git a
lickin'!</p>

<p>JIM--Me, too.</p>

<p>ELLA--I won't mind it much.</p>

<p>JIM--Me nuther.</p>

<p>ELLA--See you going to school tomorrow?</p>

<p>JIM--Sure.</p>

<p>ELLA--I gotta skip now.</p>

<p>JIM--Me, too.</p>

<p>ELLA--I like you, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--I like you.</p>

<p>ELLA--Don't forget.</p>

<p>JIM--Don't you.</p>

<p>ELLA--Good-by.</p>

<p>JIM--So long. (<i>They run away from each other--then stop
abruptly, and turn as at a signal.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--Don't forget.</p>

<p>JIM--I won't, you bet!</p>

<p>ELLA--Here! (<i>She kisses her hand at him, then runs off in
frantic embarrassment.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>overcome</i>) Gee! (<i>Then he turns and darts away,

<h2><a name="s102">SCENE TWO</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The same corner. Nine years have passed. It is again late
Spring at a time in the evening which immediately follows the
hour of Scene One. Nothing has changed much. One street is still
all white, the other all black. The fire escapes are laden with
drooping human beings. The grocery store is still at the corner.
The street noises are now more rhythmically mechanical,
electricity having taken the place of horse and steam. People
pass, white and black. They laugh as in Scene One. From the
street of the whites the high-pitched nasal tenor sings: "Gee, I
Wish That I Had a Girl," and the Negro replies with "All I Got
Was Sympathy." The singing is followed again by laughter from
both streets. Then silence. The dusk grows darker. With a
spluttering flare the arc-lamp at the corner is lit and sheds a
pale glare over the street. Two young roughs slouch up to the
corner, as tough in manner as they can make themselves. One is
the Shorty of Scene One; the other the Negro, Joe. They stand
loafing. A boy of seventeen or so passes by, escorting a girl of
about the same age. Both are dressed in their best, the boy in
black with stiff collar, the girl in white.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>scornfully</i>) Hully cripes! Pipe who's here.
(<i>to the girl, sneeringly</i>) Wha's matter, Liz? Don't yer
recernize yer old fr'ens?</p>

<p>GIRL--(<i>frightenedly</i>) Hello, Shorty.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Why de glad rags? Goin' to graduation? (<i>He tries to
obstruct their way, but, edging away from him, they turn and
run.</i>)</p>

<p>JOE--Har-har! Look at dem scoot, will you! (<i>Shorty grins
with satisfaction.</i>)</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>looking down other street</i>) Here comes
Mickey.</p>

<p>JOE--He won de semi-final last night easy?</p>

<p>SHORTY--Knocked de bloke out in de thoid.</p>

<p>JOE--Dat boy's suah a-comin'! He'll be de champeen yit.</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>judicially</i>) Got a good chanct--if he leaves de
broads alone. Dat's where he's wide open. (<i>Mickey comes in
from the left. He is dressed loudly, a straw hat with a gaudy
band cocked over one cauliflower ear. He has acquired a typical
"pug's" face, with the added viciousness of a natural bully. One
of his eyes is puffed, almost closed, as a result of his battle
the night before. He swaggers up.</i>)</p>

<p>BOTH--Hello, Mickey.</p>

<p>MICKEY--Hello.</p>

<p>JOE--Hear you knocked him col'.</p>

<p>MICKEY--Sure. I knocked his block off. (<i>changing the
subject</i>) Say. Seen 'em goin' past to de graduation
racket?</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>with a wink</i>) Why? You int'rested?</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>chuckling</i>) Mickey's gwine roun' git a good
conduct medal.</p>

<p>MICKEY--Sure. Dey kin pin it on de seat o' me pants. (<i>They
laugh.</i>) Listen. Seen Ella Downey goin'?</p>

<p>SHORTY--Painty Face? No, she ain't been along.</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>with authority</i>) Can dat name, see! Want a
bunch o' fives in yer kisser? Den nix! She's me goil,
understan'?</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>venturing to joke</i>) Which one? Yo' number ten?</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>flattered</i>) Sure. De real K. O. one.</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>pointing right--sneeringly</i>) Gee! Pipe Jim Crow
all dolled up for de racket.</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>with disgusted resentment</i>) You mean tell me dat
nigger's graduatin'?</p>

<p>SHORTY--Ask him. (<i>Jim Harris comes in. He is dressed in
black, stiff white collar, etc.--a quiet-mannered Negro boy with
a queerly-baffled, sensitive face.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>pleasantly</i>) Hello, fellows. (<i>They grunt in
reply, looking over him scornfully.</i>)</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>staring resentfully</i>) Is you graduatin'
tonight?</p>

<p>JIM--Yes.</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>spitting disgustedly</i>) Fo' Gawd's sake! You
<i>is</i> gittin' high-falutin'!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>smiling deprecatingly</i>) This is my second try. I
didn't pass last year.</p>

<p>JOE--What de hell does it git you, huh? Whatever is you gwine
do wid it now you gits it? Live lazy on yo' ol' woman?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>assertively</i>) I'm going to study and become a
lawyer.</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>with a snort</i>) Fo' Chris' sake, nigger!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>fiercely</i>) Don't you call me that--not before
them!</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>pugnaciously</i>) Does you deny you's a nigger? I
shows you--</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>gives them both a push--truculently</i>) Cut it
out, see! I'm runnin' dis corner. (<i>turning to Jim
insultingly</i>) Say you! Painty Face's gittin' her ticket
tonight, ain't she?</p>

<p>JIM--You mean Ella--</p>

<p>MICKEY--Painty Face Downey, dat's who I mean! I don't have to
be perlite wit' her. She's me goil!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>glumly</i>) Yes, she's graduating.</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>winks at Mickey</i>) Smart, huh?</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>winks back--meaningly</i>) Willin' to loin, take
it from me! (<i>Jim stands tensely as if a struggle were going on
in him.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>finally blurts out</i>) I want to speak to you,
Mickey--alone.</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>surprised--insultingly</i>) Aw, what de
hell--!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>excitedly</i>) It's important, I tell you!</p>

<p>MICKEY--Huh? (<i>stares at him inquisitively--then motions the
others back carelessly and follows Jim down front</i>)</p>

<p>SHORTY--Some noive!</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>vengefully</i>) I gits dat Jim alone, you wait!</p>

<p>MICKEY--Well, spill de big news. I ain't got all night. I got
a date.</p>

<p>JIM--With--Ella?</p>

<p>MICKEY--What's dat to you?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>the words tumbling out</i>) What--I wanted to say! I
know--I've heard--all the stories--what you've been doing around
the ward--with other girls--it's none of my business, with
them--but she--Ella--it's different--she's not that kind--</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>insultingly</i>) Who told yuh so, huh?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>draws back his fist threateningly</i>) Don't you
dare--! (<i>Mickey is so paralyzed by this effrontery that he
actually steps back.</i>)</p>

<p>MICKEY--Say, cut de comedy! (<i>beginning to feel
insulted</i>) Listen, you Jim Crow! Ain't you wise I could give
yuh one poke dat'd knock yuh into next week?</p>

<p>JIM--I'm only asking you to act square, Mickey.</p>

<p>MICKEY--What's it to yuh? Why, yuh lousy goat, she wouldn't
spit on yuh even! She hates de sight of a coon.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>in agony</i>) I--I know--but once she didn't mind--we
were kids together--</p>

<p>MICKEY--Aw, ferget dat! Dis is <i>now!</i></p>

<p>JIM--And I'm still her friend always--even if she don't like
colored people--</p>

<p>MICKEY--<i>Coons,</i> why don't yuh say it right! De trouble
wit' you is yuh're gittin' stuck up, dat's what! Stay where yeh
belong, see! Yer old man made coin at de truckin' game and yuh're
tryin' to buy yerself white--graduatin' and law, for Christ sake!
Yuh're gittin' yerself in Dutch wit' everyone in de ward--and it
ain't cause yer a coon neider. Don't de gang all train wit' Joe
dere and lots of others? But yuh're tryin' to buy white and it
won't git yuh no place, see!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>trembling</i>) Some day--I'll show you--</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>turning away</i>) Aw, gwan!</p>

<p>JIM--D'you think I'd change--be you--your dirty white--!</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>whirling about</i>) What's dat?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>with hysterical vehemence</i>) You act square with
her--or I'll show you up--I'll report you--I'll write to the
papers--the sporting writers--I'll let them know how white you
are!</p>

<p>MICKEY--(<i>infuriated</i>) Yuh damn nigger, I'll bust yer jaw
in! (<i>Assuming his ring pose he weaves toward Jim, his face set
in a cruel scowl. Jim waits helplessly but with a certain
dignity.</i>)</p>

<p>SHORTY--Cheese it! A couple bulls! And here's de Downey skoit
comin', too.</p>

<p>MICKEY--I'll get yuh de next time! (<i>Ella Downey enters from
the right. She is seventeen, still has the same rose and white
complexion, is pretty but with a rather repelling bold air about
her.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>smiles with pleasure when she sees Mickey</i>)
Hello, Mick. Am I late? Say, I'm so glad you won last night.
(<i>She glances from one to the other as she feels something in
the air.</i>) Hello! What's up?</p>

<p>MICKEY--Dis boob. (<i>He indicates Jim scornfully.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>diffidently</i>) Hello, Ella.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>shortly, turning away</i>) Hello. (<i>then to
Mickey</i>) Come on, Mick. Walk down with me. I got to hurry.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>blurts out</i>) Wait--just a second.
(<i>painfully</i>) Ella, do you hate--colored people?</p>

<p>MICKEY--Aw, shut up!</p>

<p>JIM--Please answer.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>forcing a laugh</i>) Say! What is this--another
exam?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>doggedly</i>) Please answer.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>irritably</i>) Of course I don't! Haven't I been
brought up alongside--Why, some of my oldest--the girls I've been
to public school the longest with--</p>

<p>JIM--Do you hate me, Ella?</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>confusedly and more irritably</i>) Say, is he drunk?
Why should I? I don't hate anyone.</p>

<p>JIM--Then why haven't you ever hardly spoken to me--for
years?</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>resentfully</i>) What would I speak about? You and
me've got nothing in common any more.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>desperately</i>) Maybe not any more--but--right on
this corner--do you remember once--?</p>

<p>ELLA--I don't remember nothing! (<i>angrily</i>) Say! What's
got into you to be butting into my business all of a sudden like
this? Because you finally managed to graduate, has it gone to
your head?</p>

<p>JIM--No, I--only want to help you, Ella.</p>

<p>ELLA--Of all the nerve! You're certainly forgetting your
place! Who's asking you for help, I'd like to know? Shut up and

<p>JIM--(<i>insistently</i>) If you ever need a friend--a true
friend--</p>

<p>ELLA--I've got lots of friends among my own--kind, I can tell
you. (<i>exasperatedly</i>) You make me sick! Go to the devil!
(<i>She flounces off. The three men laugh. Mickey follows her.
Jim is stricken. He goes and sinks down limply on a box in front
of the grocery store.</i>)</p>

<p>SHORTY--I'm going to shoot a drink. Come on, Joe, and I'll
blow yuh.</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>who has never ceased to follow every move of Jim's
with</i> <i>angry, resentful eyes</i>) Go long. I'se gwine stay
here a secon'. I got a lil' argyment. (<i>He points to
Jim.</i>)</p>

<p>SHORTY--Suit yerself. Do a good job. See yuh later. (<i>He
goes, whistling.</i>)</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>stands for a while glaring at Jim, his fierce little
eyes peering out of his black face. Then he spits on his hands
aggressively and strides up to the oblivious Jim. He stands in
front of him, gradually working himself into a fury at the
other's seeming indifference to his words.</i>) Listen to me,
nigger: I got a heap to whisper in yo' ear! Who is you, anyhow?
Who does you think you is? Don't yo' old man and mine work on de
docks togidder befo' yo' old man gits his own truckin' business?
Yo' ol' man swallers his nickels, my ol' man buys him beer wid
dem and swallers dat--dat's the on'y diff'rence. Don't you 'n' me
drag up togidder?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>dully</i>) I'm your friend, Joe.</p>

<p>JOE--No, you isn't! I ain't no fren o' yourn! I don't even
know who you is! What's all dis schoolin' you doin'? What's all
dis dressin' up and graduatin' an' sayin' you gwine study be a
lawyer? What's all dis fakin' an' pretendin' and swellin' out
grand an' talkin' soft and perlite? What's all dis denyin' you's
a nigger--an' wid de white boys listenin' to you say it! Is you
aimin' to buy white wid yo' ol' man's dough like Mickey say? What
is you? (<i>in a rage at the other's silence</i>) You don't talk?
Den I takes it out o' yo' hide! (<i>He grabs Jim by the throat
with one hand and draws the other fist back.</i>) Tell me befo' I
wrecks yo' face in! Is you a nigger or isn't you? (<i>shaking
him</i>) Is you a nigger, Nigger? Nigger, is you a nigger?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>looking into his eyes--quietly</i>) Yes. I'm a
nigger. We're both niggers. (<i>They look at each other for a
moment. Joe's rage vanishes. He slumps onto a box beside Jim's.
He offers him a cigarette. Jim takes it. Joe scratches a match
and lights both their cigarettes.</i>)</p>

<p>JOE--(<i>after a puff, with full satisfaction</i>) Man, why
didn't you 'splain dat in de fust place?</p>

<p>JIM--We're both niggers. (<i>The same hand-organ man of Scene
One comes to the corner. He plays the chorus of "Bonbon Buddie
The Chocolate Drop." They both stare straight ahead listening.
Then the organ man goes away. A silence. Joe gets to his
feet.</i>)</p>

<p>JOE--I'll go get me a cold beer. (<i>He starts to move
off--then turns.</i>) Time you was graduatin', ain't it? (<i>He

<h2><a name="s103">SCENE THREE</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The same corner five years later. Nothing has changed much.
It is a night in Spring. The arc-lamp discovers faces with a
favorless cruelty. The street noises are the same but more
intermittent and dulled with a quality of fatigue. Two people
pass, one black and one white. They are tired. They both yawn,
but neither laughs. There is no laughter from the two streets.
From the street of the whites the tenor, more nasal than ever and
a bit drunken, wails in high barber-shop falsetto the last half
of the chorus of "When I Lost You." The Negro voice, a bit
maudlin in turn, replies with the last half of "Waitin' for the
Robert E. Lee." Silence. Shorty enters. He looks tougher than
ever, the typical gangster. He stands waiting, singing a bit
drunkenly, peering down the street.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>indignantly</i>) Yuh bum! Ain't yuh ever comin'?
(<i>He begins to sing</i>) "And sewed up in her yeller kimona,
She had a blue-barreled forty-five gun, For to get her man Who'd
done her wrong." (<i>Then he comments scornfully</i>) Not her,
dough! No gat for her. She ain't got de noive. A little sugar.
Dat'll fix her. (<i>Ella enters. She is dressed poorly, her face
is pale and hollow-eyed, her voice cold and tired.</i>)</p>

<p>SHORTY--Yuh got de message?</p>

<p>ELLA--Here I am.</p>

<p>SHORTY--How yuh been?</p>

<p>ELLA--All right. (<i>A pause. He looks at her
puzzledly.</i>)</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>a bit embarrassedly</i>) Well, I s'pose yuh'd like
me to give yuh some dope on Mickey, huh?</p>

<p>ELLA--No.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Mean to say yuh don't wanter know where he is or what
he's doin'?</p>

<p>ELLA--No.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Since when?</p>

<p>ELLA--A long time.</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>after a pause--with a rat-like viciousness</i>)
Between you'n me, kid, you'll get even soon--you'n all de odder
dames he's tossed. I'm on de inside. I've watched him trainin'.
His next scrap, watch it! He'll go! It won't be de odder guy.
It'll be all youse dames he's kidded--and de ones what's kidded
him. Youse'll all be in de odder guy's corner. He won't need no
odder seconds. Youse'll trow water on him, and sponge his face,
and take de kinks out of his socker--and Mickey'll catch it on de
button--and he won't be able to take it no more--'cause all your
weight--you and de odders--'ll be behind dat punch. Ha ha! (<i>He
laughs an evil laugh.</i>) And Mickey'll go--down to his knees
first--(<i>He sinks to his knees in the attitude of a groggy
boxer.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--I'd like to see him on his knees!</p>

<p>SHORTY--And den--flat on his pan--dead to de world--de boidies
singin' in de trees--ten--out! (<i>He suits his action to the
words, sinking flat on the pavement, then rises and laughs the
same evil laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--He's been out--for me--a long time. (<i>a pause</i>) Why
did you send for me?</p>

<p>SHORTY--He sent me.</p>

<p>ELLA--Why?</p>

<p>SHORTY--To slip you dis wad o' dough. (<i>He reluctantly takes
a roll of bills from his pocket and holds it out to her.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>looks at the money indifferently</i>) What for?</p>

<p>SHORTY--For you.</p>

<p>ELLA--No.</p>

<p>SHORTY--For de kid den.</p>

<p>ELLA--The kid's dead. He took diphtheria.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Hell yuh say! When?</p>

<p>ELLA--A long time.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Why didn't you write Mickey--?</p>

<p>ELLA--Why should I? He'd only be glad.</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>after a pause</i>) Well--it's better.</p>

<p>ELLA--Yes.</p>

<p>SHORTY--You made up wit yer family?</p>

<p>ELLA--No chance.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Livin' alone?</p>

<p>ELLA--In Brooklyn.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Workin'?</p>

<p>ELLA--In a factory.</p>

<p>SHORTY--You're a sucker. There's lots of softer snaps fer you,
kid--</p>

<p>ELLA--I know what you mean. No.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Don't yuh wanter step out no more--have fun--live?</p>

<p>ELLA--I'm through.</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>mockingly</i>) Jump in de river, huh? T'ink it
over, baby. I kin start yuh right in my stable. No one'll bodder
yuh den. I got influence.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>without emphasis</i>) You're a dirty dog. Why
doesn't someone kill you?</p>

<p>SHORTY--Is dat so! What're you? They say you been travelin'
round with Jim Crow.</p>

<p>ELLA--He's been my only friend.</p>

<p>SHORTY--A nigger!</p>

<p>ELLA--The only white man in the world! Kind and white. You're
all black--black to the heart.</p>

<p>SHORTY--Nigger-lover! (<i>He throws the money in her face. It
falls to the street.</i>) Listen, you! Mickey says he's off of
yuh for keeps. Dis is de finish! Dat's what he sent me to tell
you. (<i>glances at her searchingly--a pause</i>) Yuh won't make
no trouble?</p>

<p>ELLA--Why should I? He's free. The kid's dead. I'm free. No
hard feelings--only--I'll be there in spirit at his next fight,
tell him! I'll take your tip--the other corner--second the
punch--nine--ten--out! He's free! That's all. (<i>She grins
horribly at Shorty.</i>) Go away, Shorty.</p>

<p>SHORTY--(<i>looking at her and shaking his
head--maudlinly</i>) Groggy! Groggy! We're all groggy! Gluttons
for punishment! Me for a drink. So long. (<i>He goes. A Salvation
Army band comes toward the corner. They are playing and singing
"Till We Meet at Jesus' Feet." They reach the end as they enter
and stop before Ella. The Captain steps forward.</i>)</p>

<p>CAPTAIN--Sister--</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>picks up the money and drops it in his
hat--mockingly</i>) Here. Go save yourself. Leave me alone.</p>

<p>A WOMAN SALVATIONIST--Sister--</p>

<p>ELLA--Never mind that. I'm not in your line--yet. (<i>as</i>
<i>they hesitate, wonderingly</i>) I want to be alone. (<i>To the
thud of the big drum they march off. Ella sits down on a box, her
hands hanging at her sides. Presently Jim Harris comes in. He has
grown into a quietly-dressed, studious-looking Negro with an
intelligent yet queerly-baffled face.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>with a joyous but bewildered cry</i>) Ella! I just
saw Shorty--</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>smiling at him with frank affection</i>) He had a
message from Mickey.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>sadly</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>pointing to the box behind her</i>) Sit down. (<i>He
does so. A pause--then she says indifferently</i>) It's finished.
I'm free, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>wearily</i>) We're never free--except to do what we
have to do.</p>

<p>ELLA--What are you getting gloomy about all of a sudden?</p>

<p>JIM--I've got the report from the school. I've flunked
again.</p>

<p>ELLA--Poor Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--Don't pity me. I'd like to kick myself all over the
block. Five years--and I'm still plugging away where I ought to
have been at the end of two.</p>

<p>ELLA--Why don't you give it up?</p>

<p>JIM--No!</p>

<p>ELLA--After all, what's being a lawyer?</p>

<p>JIM--A lot--to me--what it means. (<i>intensely</i>) Why, if I
was a Member of the Bar right now, Ella, I believe I'd almost
have the courage to--</p>

<p>ELLA--What?</p>

<p>JIM--Nothing. (<i>after a pause--gropingly</i>) I can't
explain--just--but it hurts like fire. It brands me in my pride.
I swear I know more'n any member of my class. I ought to, I study
harder. I work like the devil. It's all in my head--all fine and
correct to a T. Then when I'm called on--I stand up--all the
white faces looking at me--and I can feel their eyes--I hear my
own voice sounding funny, trembling--and all of a sudden it's all
gone in my head--there's nothing remembered--and I hear myself
stuttering--and give up--sit down--They don't laugh, hardly ever.
They're kind. They're good people. (<i>in a frenzy</i>) They're
considerate, damn them! But I feel branded!</p>

<p>ELLA--Poor Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>going on painfully</i>) And it's the same thing in
the written exams. For weeks before I study all night. I can't
sleep anyway. I learn it all, I see it, I understand it. Then
they give me the paper in the exam room. I look it over, I know
each answer--perfectly. I take up my pen. On all sides are white
men starting to write. They're so sure--even the ones that I know
know nothing. But I know it all--but I can't remember any
more--it fades--it goes--it's gone. There's a blank in my
head--stupidity--I sit like a fool fighting to remember a little
bit here, a little bit there--not enough to pass--not enough for
anything--when I know it all!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>compassionately</i>) Jim. It isn't worth it. You
don't need to--</p>

<p>JIM--I need it more than anyone ever needed anything. I need
it to live.</p>

<p>ELLA--What'll it prove?</p>

<p>JIM--Nothing at all much--but everything to me.</p>

<p>ELLA--You're so much better than they are in every other
way.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>looking up at her</i>) Then--you understand?</p>

<p>ELLA--Of course. (<i>affectionately</i>) Don't I know how fine
you've been to me! You've been the only one in the world who's
stood by me--the only understanding person--and all after the
rotten way I used to treat you.</p>

<p>JIM--But before that--way back so high--you treated me good.
(<i>He smiles.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--You've been white to me, Jim. (<i>She takes his
hand.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--White--to you!</p>

<p>ELLA--Yes.</p>

<p>JIM--All love is white. I've always loved you. (<i>this with
the deepest humility</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--Even now--after all that's happened!</p>

<p>JIM--Always.</p>

<p>ELLA--I like you, Jim--better than anyone else in the
world.</p>

<p>JIM--That's more than enough, more than I ever hoped for.
(<i>The organ grinder comes to the corner. He plays the chorus of
"Annie Laurie." They sit listening, hand in hand.</i>) Would you
ever want to marry me, Ella?</p>

<p>ELLA--Yes, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>as if this quick consent alarmed him</i>) No, no,
don't answer now. Wait! Turn it over in your mind! Think what it
means to you! Consider it--over and over again! I'm in no hurry,
Ella. I can wait months--years--</p>

<p>ELLA--I'm alone. I've got to be helped. I've got to help
someone--or it's the end--one end or another.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>eagerly</i>) Oh, I'll help--I know I can help--I'll
give my life to help you--that's what I've been living for--</p>

<p>ELLA--But can I help you? Can I help you?</p>

<p>JIM--Yes! Yes! We'll go abroad where a man is a man--where it
don't make that difference--where people are kind and wise to see
the soul under skins. I don't ask you to love me--I don't dare to
hope nothing like that! I don't want nothing--only to wait--to
know you like me--to be near you--to keep harm away--to make up
for the past--to never let you suffer any more--to serve you--to
lie at your feet like a dog that loves you--to kneel by your bed
like a nurse that watches over you sleeping--to preserve and
protect and shield you from evil and sorrow---to give my life and
my blood and all the strength that's in me to give you peace and
joy--to become your slave!--yes, be your slave--your black slave
that adores you as sacred! (<i>He has sunk to his knees. In a
frenzy of self-abnegation, as he says the last words he beats his
head on the flagstones.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>overcome and alarmed</i>) Jim! Jim! You're crazy! I
want to help you, Jim--I want to help--</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Some weeks or so later. A street in the same ward in front
of an old brick church. The church sets back from the sidewalk in
a yard enclosed by a rusty iron railing with a gate at center. On
each side of this yard are tenements. The buildings have a stern,
forbidding look. All the shades on the windows are drawn down,
giving an effect of staring, brutal eyes that pry callously at
human beings without acknowledging them. Even the two tall,
narrow church windows on either side of the arched door are
blanked with dull green shades. It is a bright sunny morning. The
district is unusually still, as if it were waiting, holding its
breath.</i></p>

<p><i>From the street of the blacks to the right a Negro tenor
sings in a voice of shadowy richness--the first stanza with a
contented, childlike melancholy--</i></p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I feel like a mourning dove,<br>
 Sometimes I feel like a mourning dove,<br>
 Sometimes I feel like a mourning dove,<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I feel like an eagle in the air,<br>
 Sometimes I feel like an eagle in the air,<br>
 Sometimes I feel like an eagle in the air,<br>

 Sometimes I wish that I'd never been born,<br>

 Wish that I'd never been born.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>As the music dies down there is a pause of waiting
stillness. This is broken by one startling, metallic clang of the
church-bell. As if it were a signal, people--men, women,
children--pour from the two tenements, whites from the tenement
to the left, blacks from the one to the right. They hurry to form
into two racial lines on each side of the gate, rigid and
unyielding, staring across at each other with bitter hostile
eyes. The halves of the big church door swing open and Jim and
Ella step out from the darkness within into the sunlight. The
doors slam behind them like wooden lips of an idol that has spat
them out. Jim is dressed in black. Ella in white, both with
extreme plainness. They stand in the sunlight, shrinking and
confused. All the hostile eyes are now concentrated on them. They
become aware of the two lines through which they must pass; they
hesitate and tremble; then stand there staring</i> <i>back at the
people as fixed and immovable as they are. The organ grinder
comes in from the right. He plays the chorus of "Old Black Joe."
As he finishes the bell of the church clangs one more single
stroke, insistently dismissing.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JIM--(<i>as if the sound had awakened him from a trance,
reaches out and takes her hand</i>) Come. Time we got to the
steamer. Time we sailed away over the sea. Come, Honey! (<i>She
tries to answer but her lips tremble; she cannot take her eyes
off the eyes of the people; she is unable to move. He sees this
and, keeping the same tone of profound, affectionate kindness, he
points upward in the sky, and gradually persuades her eyes to
look up.</i>) Look up, Honey! See the sun! Feel his warm eye
lookin' down! Feel how kind he looks! Feel his blessing deep in
your heart, your bones! Look up, Honey! (<i>Her eyes are fixed on
the sky now. Her face is calm. She tries to smile bravely back at
the sun. Now he pulls her by the hand, urging her gently to walk
with him down through the yard and gate, through the lines of
people. He is maintaining an attitude to support them through the
ordeal only by a terrible effort, which manifests itself in the
hysteric quality of ecstasy which breaks into his voice.</i>) And
look at the sky! Ain't it kind and blue! Blue for hope. Don't
they say blue's for hope? Hope! That's for us, Honey. All those
blessings in the sky! What's it the Bible says? Falls on just and
unjust alike? No, that's the sweet rain. Pshaw, what am I saying?
All mixed up. There's no unjust about it. We're all the
same--equally just--under the sky--under the sun--under
God--sailing over the sea--to the other side of the world--the
side where Christ was born--the kind side that takes count of the
soul--over the sea--the sea's blue, too--. Let's not be
late--let's get that steamer! (<i>They have reached the curb now,
passed the lines of people. She is looking up to the sky with an
expression of trancelike calm and peace. He is on the verge of
collapse, his face twitching, his eyes staring. He calls
hoarsely</i>) Taxi! Where is he? Taxi!</p>

<h2><a name="s201">SCENE ONE</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Two years later. A flat of the better sort in the Negro
district near the corner of Act One. This is the parlor. Its
furniture is a queer clash. The old pieces are cheaply ornate,
na&iuml;vely, childishly gaudy--the new pieces give evidence of a
taste that is diametrically opposed, severe to the point of
somberness. On one wall, in a heavy gold frame, is a colored
photograph--the portrait of an elderly Negro with an able, shrewd
face but dressed in outlandish lodge regalia, a get-up adorned
with medals, sashes, a cocked hat with frills--the whole effect
as absurd to contemplate as one of Napoleon's Marshals in full
uniform. In the left corner, where a window lights it
effectively, is a Negro primitive mask from the Congo--a
grotesque face, inspiring obscure, dim connotations in one's
mind, but beautifully done, conceived in a true religious spirit.
In this room, however, the mask acquires an arbitrary
accentuation. It dominates by a diabolical quality that contrast
imposes upon it.</i></p>

<p><i>There are two windows on the left looking out in the
street. In the rear, a door to the hall of the building. In the
right, a doorway with red and gold porti&egrave;res leading into
the bedroom and the rest of the flat. Everything is cleaned and
polished. The dark brown wall paper is new, the brilliantly
figured carpet also. There is a round mahogany table at center.
In a rocking chair by the table Mrs. Harris is sitting. She is a
mild-looking, gray-haired Negress of sixty-five, dressed in an
old-fashioned Sunday-best dress. Walking about the room nervously
is Hattie, her daughter, Jim's sister, a woman of about thirty
with a high-strung, defiant face--an intelligent head showing
both power and courage. She is dressed severely,
mannishly.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a fine morning in Spring. Sunshine comes through the
windows at the left.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>MRS. HARRIS--Time dey was here, ain't it?</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>impatiently</i>) Yes.</p>

<p>MRS. H.--(<i>worriedly</i>) You ain't gwine ter kick up a
fuss, is you--like you done wid Jim befo' de weddin'?</p>

<p>HATTIE--No. What's done is done.</p>

<p>MRS. H.--We mustn't let her see we hold it agin' her--de bad
dat happened to her wid dat no-count fighter.</p>

<p>HATTIE--I certainly never give that a thought. It's what she's
done to Jim--making him run away and give up his fight--!</p>

<p>MRS. H.--Jim loves her a powerful lot, must be.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>after a pause--bitterly</i>) I wonder if she loves
Jim!</p>

<p>MRS. H.--She must, too. Yes, she must, too. Don't you forget
dat it was hard for her--mighty, mighty hard--harder for de white
dan for de black!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>indignantly</i>) Why should it be?</p>

<p>MRS. H.--(<i>shaking her head</i>) I ain't talkin' of shoulds.
It's too late for shoulds. Dey's o'ny one should.
(<i>solemnly</i>) De white and de black shouldn't mix dat close.
Dere's one road where de white goes on alone; dere's anudder road
where de black goes on alone--</p>

<p>HATTIE--Yes, if they'd only leave us alone!</p>

<p>MRS. H.--Dey leaves your Pa alone. He comes to de top till
he's got his own business, lots o' money in de bank, he owns a
building even befo' he die. (<i>She looks up proudly at the
picture. Hattie sighs impatiently--then her mother goes on.</i>)
Dey leaves me alone. I bears four children into dis worl', two
dies, two lives, I helps you two grow up fine an' healthy and
eddicated wid schoolin' and money fo' yo' comfort--</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>impatiently</i>) Ma!</p>

<p>MRS. H.--I does de duty God set for me in dis worl'. Dey
leaves me alone. (<i>Hattie goes to the window to hide her
exasperation. The mother broods for a minute--then goes on.</i>)
The worl' done change. Dey ain't no satisfaction wid nuffin' no

<p>HATTIE--Oh! (<i>then after a pause</i>) They'll be here any
minute now.</p>

<p>MRS. H.--Why didn't you go meet 'em at de dock like I axed
you?</p>

<p>HATTIE--I couldn't. My face and Jim's among those hundreds of
white faces--(<i>with a harsh laugh</i>) It would give her too
much advantage!</p>

<p>MRS. H.--(<i>impatiently</i>) Don't talk dat way! What makes
you so proud? (<i>then after a pause--sadly</i>) Hattie.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>turning</i>) Yes, Ma.</p>

<p>MRS. H.--I want to see Jim again--my only boy--but--all de
same I'd rather he stayed away. He say in his letter he's happy,
she's happy, dey likes it dere, de folks don't think nuffin' but
what's natural at seeing 'em married. Why don't dey stay?</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>vehemently</i>) No! They were cowards to run away.
If they believe in what they've done, then let them face it out,
live it out here, be strong enough to conquer all prejudice!</p>

<p>MRS. H.--Strong? Dey ain't many strong. Dey ain't many happy
neider. Dey was happy ovah yondah.</p>

<p>HATTIE--We don't deserve happiness till we've fought the fight
of our race and won it! (<i>In the pause that follows there is a
ring from back in the flat.</i>) It's the door bell! You go, Ma.
I--I--I'd rather not. (<i>Her mother looks at her rebukingly and
goes out agitatedly through the porti&egrave;res. Hattie waits,
nervously walking about, trying to compose herself. There is a
long pause. Finally the porti&egrave;res are parted and Jim
enters. He looks much older, graver, worried.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--Hattie!</p>

<p>HATTIE--Jim! (<i>They embrace with great affection.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--It's great to see you again! You're looking fine.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>looking at him searchingly</i>) You look well,
too--thinner maybe--and tired. (<i>then as she sees him
frowning</i>) But where's Ella?</p>

<p>JIM--With Ma. (<i>apologetically</i>) She sort of--broke
down--when we came in. The trip wore her out.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>coldly</i>) I see.</p>

<p>JIM--Oh, it's nothing serious. Nerves. She needs a rest.</p>

<p>HATTIE--Wasn't living in France restful?</p>

<p>JIM--Yes, but--too lonely--especially for her.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>resentfully</i>) Why? Didn't the people there want
to associate--?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>quickly</i>) Oh, no indeedy, they didn't think
anything of that. (<i>after a pause</i>) But--she did. For the
first year it was all right. Ella liked everything a lot. She
went out with French folks and got so she could talk it a
little--and I learned it--a little. We were having a right nice
time. I never thought then we'd ever want to come back here.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>frowning</i>) But--what happened to change
you?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>after a pause--haltingly</i>) Well--you see--the
first year--she and I were living around--like friends--like a
brother and sister--like you and I might.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>her face becoming more and more drawn and
tense</i>) You mean--then--? (<i>She shudders--then after a
pause</i>) She loves you, Jim?</p>

<p>JIM--If I didn't know that I'd have to jump in the river.</p>

<p>HATTIE--Are you sure she loves you?</p>

<p>JIM--Isn't that why she's suffering?</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>letting her breath escape through her clenched
teeth</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>suddenly springs up and shouts almost
hysterically</i>) Why d'you ask me all those damn questions? Are
you trying to make trouble between us?</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>controlling herself--quietly</i>) No, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>after a pause--contritely</i>) I'm sorry, Hattie. I'm
kind of on edge today. (<i>He sink down on his chair--then goes
on as if something forced him to speak.</i>) After that we got to
living housed in. Ella didn't want to see nobody, she said just
the two of us was enough. I was happy then--and I really guess
she was happy, too--in a way--for a while. (<i>again a pause</i>)
But she never did get to wanting to go out any place again. She
got to saying she felt she'd be sure to run into someone she
knew--from over here. So I moved us out to the country where no
tourist ever comes--but it didn't make any difference to her. She
got to avoiding the French folks the same as if they were
Americans and I couldn't get it out of her mind. She lived in the
house and got paler and paler, and more and more nervous and
scarey, always imagining things--until I got to imagining things,
too. I got to feeling blue. Got to sneering at myself that I
wasn't any better than a quitter because I sneaked away right
after getting married, didn't face nothing, gave up trying to
become a Member of the Bar--and I got to suspecting Ella must
feel that way about me, too--that I wasn't a <i>real man!</i></p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>indignantly</i>) She couldn't!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>with hostility</i>) You don't need to tell me! All
this was only in my own mind. We never quarreled a single bit. We
never said a harsh word. We were as close to each other as could
be. We were all there was in the world to each other. We were
alone together! (<i>a pause</i>) Well, one day I got so I
couldn't stand it. I could see she couldn't stand it. So I just
up and said: Ella, we've got to have a plain talk, look
everything straight in the face, hide nothing, come out with the
exact truth of the way we feel.</p>

<p>HATTIE--And you decided to come back!</p>

<p>JIM--Yes. We decided the reason we felt sort of ashamed was
we'd acted like cowards. We'd run away from the thing--and taken
it with us. We decided to come back and face it and live it down
in ourselves, and prove to ourselves we were strong in our
love--and then, and that way only, by being brave we'd free
ourselves, and gain confidence, and be really free inside and
able then to go anywhere and live in peace and equality with
ourselves and the world without any guilty uncomfortable feeling
coming up to rile us. (<i>He has talked himself now into a state
of happy confidence.</i>)</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>bending over and kissing him</i>) Good for you! I
admire you so much, Jim! I admire both of you! And are you going
to begin studying right away and get admitted to the Bar?</p>

<p>JIM--You bet I am!</p>

<p>HATTIE--You must, Jim! Our race needs men like you to come to
the front and help--(<i>As voices are heard approaching she
stops, stiffens, and her face grows cold.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>noticing this--warningly</i>) Remember Ella's been
sick! (<i>losing control--threateningly</i>) You be nice to her,
you hear! (<i>Mrs. Harris enters, showing Ella the way. The
colored woman is plainly worried and perplexed. Ella is pale,
with a strange, haunted expression in her eyes. She runs to Jim
as to a refuge, clutching his hands in both of hers, looking from
Mrs. Harris to Hattie with a frightened defiance.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. H.--Dere he is, child, big's life! She was afraid we'd
done kidnapped you away, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>patting her hand</i>) This place ought to be
familiar, Ella. Don't you remember playing here with us sometimes
as a kid?</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>queerly--with a frown of effort</i>) I remember
playing marbles one night--but that was on the street.</p>

<p>JIM--Don't you remember Hattie?</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>coming forward with a forced smile</i>) It was a
long time ago--but I remember Ella. (<i>She holds out her
hand.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>taking it--looking at Hattie with the same queer
defiance</i>) I remember. But you've changed so much.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>stirred to hostility by Ella's
manner--condescendingly</i>) Yes, I've grown older, naturally.
(<i>then in a tone which, as if in spite of herself becomes
bragging</i>) I've worked so hard. First I went away to college,
you know--then I took up postgraduate study--when suddenly I
decided I'd accomplish more good if I gave up learning and took
up teaching. (<i>She suddenly checks herself ashamed, and stung
by Ella's indifference.</i>) But this sounds like stupid
boasting. I don't mean that. I was only explaining--</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>indifferently</i>) I didn't know you'd been to
school so long. (<i>a pause</i>) Where are you teaching? In a
colored school, I suppose. (<i>There is an indifferent
superiority in her words that is maddening to Hattie.</i>)</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>controlling herself</i>) Yes. A private school
endowed by some wealthy members of our race.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>suddenly--even eagerly</i>) Then you must have taken
lots of examinations and managed to pass them, didn't you?</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>biting her lips</i>) I always passed with
honors!</p>

<p>ELLA--Yes, we both graduated from the same High School, didn't
we? That was dead easy for me. Why I hardly even looked at a
book. But Jim says it was awfully hard for him. He failed one
year, remember? (<i>She turns and smiles at Jim--a tolerant,
superior smile but one full of genuine love. Hattie is outraged,
but Jim smiles.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--Yes, it was hard for me, Honey.</p>

<p>ELLA--And the law school examinations Jim hardly ever could
pass at all. Could you? (<i>She laughs lovingly.</i>)</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>harshly</i>) Yes, he could! He can! He'll pass
them now--if you'll give him a chance!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>angrily</i>) Hattie!</p>

<p>MRS. HARRIS--Hold yo' fool tongue!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>sullenly</i>) I'm sorry. (<i>Ella has shrunk back
against Jim. She regards Hattie with a sort of wondering hatred.
Then she looks away about the room. Suddenly her eyes fasten on
the primitive mask and she gives a stifled scream.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--What's the matter, Honey?</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>pointing</i>) That! For God's sake, what is it?</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>scornfully</i>) It's a Congo mask. (<i>She goes
and picks it up.</i>) I'll take it away if you wish. I thought
you'd like it. It was my wedding present to Jim.</p>

<p>ELLA--What is it?</p>

<p>HATTIE--It's a mask which used to be worn in religious
ceremonies by my people in Africa. But, aside from that, it's
beautifully made, a work of Art by a real artist--as real in his
way as your Michael Angelo. (<i>forces Ella to take it</i>) Here.
Just notice the workmanship.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>defiantly</i>) I'm not scared of it if you're not.
(<i>looking at it with disgust</i>) Beautiful? Well, some people
certainly have queer notions! It looks ugly to me and
stupid--like a kid's game--making faces! (<i>She slaps it
contemptuously.</i>) Pooh! You needn't look hard at me. I'll give
you the laugh. (<i>She goes to put it back on the stand.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--Maybe, if it disturbs you, we better put it in some other
room.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>defiantly aggressive</i>) No. I want it here where I
can give it the laugh! (<i>She sets it there again--then turns
suddenly on Hattie with aggressive determination.</i>) Jim's not
going to take any more examinations! I won't let him!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>bursting forth</i>) Jim! Do you hear that? There's
white justice!--their fear for their superiority!--</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>with a terrified pleading</i>) Make her go away,
Jim!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>losing control--furiously to his sister</i>) Either
you leave here--or we will!</p>

<p>MRS. H.--(<i>weeping--throws her arms around Hattie</i>) Let's
go, chile! Let's go!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>calmly now</i>) Yes, Ma. All right. (<i>They go
through the porti&egrave;res. As soon as they are gone, Jim
suddenly collapses into a chair and hides his head in his hands.
Ella stands beside him for a moment. She stares distractedly
about her, at the portrait, at the mask, at the furniture, at
Jim. She seems fighting to escape from some weight on her mind.
She throws this off and, completely her old self for the moment,
kneels by Jim and pats his shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>with kindness and love</i>) Don't, Jim! Don't cry,
please! You don't suppose I really meant that about the
examinations, do you? Why, of course, I didn't mean a word! I
couldn't mean it! I want you to take the examinations! I want you
to pass! I want you to be a lawyer! I want you to be the best
lawyer in the country! I want you to show 'em--all the dirty
sneaking, gossiping liars that talk behind our backs--what a man
I married. I want the whole world to know you're the whitest of
the white! I want you to climb and climb--and step on 'em, stamp
right on their mean faces! I love you, Jim. You know that!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>calm again--happily</i>) I hope so, Honey--and I'll
make myself worthy.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>appears in the doorway--quietly</i>) We're going
now, Jim.</p>

<p>ELLA--No. Don't go.</p>

<p>HATTIE--We were going to, anyway. This is your house--Mother's
gift to you, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>astonished</i>) But I can't accept--Where are you
going?</p>

<p>HATTIE--We've got a nice flat in the Bronx--(<i>with bitter
pride</i>) in the heart of the Black Belt--the Congo--among our
own people!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>angrily</i>) You're crazy--I'll see Ma--(<i>He goes
out. Hattie and Ella stare at each other with scorn and hatred
for a moment, then Hattie goes. Ella remains kneeling for a
moment by the chair, her eyes dazed and strange as she looks
about her. Then she gets to her feet and stands before the
portrait of Jim's father--with a sneer</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--It's his Old Man--all dolled up like a circus horse!
Well, they can't help it. It's in the blood, I suppose. They're
ignorant, that's all there is to it. (<i>She moves to the
mask--forcing a mocking tone</i>) Hello, sport! Who d'you think
you're scaring? Not me! I'll give you the laugh. He won't pass,
you wait and see. Not in a thousand years! (<i>She goes to the
window and looks down at the street and mutters</i>) All black!
Every one of them! (<i>then with sudden excitement</i>) No,
there's one. Why, it's Shorty! (<i>She throws the window open and
calls</i>) Shorty! Shorty! Hello, Shorty! (<i>She leans out and
waves--then stops, remains there for a moment looking down, then
shrinks back on the floor suddenly as if she wanted to hide--her
whole face in an anguish.</i>) Say! Say! I wonder?--No, he didn't
hear you. Yes, he did, too! He must have! I yelled so loud you
could hear me in Jersey! No, what are you talking about? How
would he hear with all the kids yelling down there? He never
heard a word, I tell you! He did, too! He didn't want to hear
you! He didn't want to let anyone know he knew you! Why don't you
acknowledge it? What are you lying about? I'm not! Why shouldn't
he? Where does he come in to--for God's sake, who is Shorty,
anyway? A pimp! Yes, and a dope-peddler, too! D'you mean to say
he'd have the nerve to hear me call him and then deliberately--?
Yes, I mean to say it! I do say it! And it's true, and you know
it, and you might as well be honest for a change and admit it! He
heard you but he didn't want to hear you! He doesn't want to know
you any more. No, not even him! He's afraid it'd get him in wrong
with the old gang. Why? You know well enough! Because you married
a--a--a--well, I won't say it, but you know without my mentioning
names! (<i>Ella springs to her feet in horror and shakes off her
obsession with a frantic effort.</i>) Stop! (<i>then whimpering
like a frightened child</i>) Jim! Jim! Jim! Where are you? I want
you, Jim! (<i>She runs out of the room as</i></p>

<h2><a name="s202">SCENE TWO</a></h2>
</center>

<p><i> </i></p>

<p><i>The same. Six months later. It is evening. The walls of the
room appear shrunken in, the ceiling lowered, so that the
furniture, the portrait, the mask look unnaturally large and
domineering. Jim is seated at the table studying, law books piled
by his elbows. He is keeping his attention concentrated only by a
driving physical effort which gives his face the expression of a
runner's near the tape. His forehead shines with perspiration. He
mutters one sentence from Blackstone over and over again, tapping
his forehead with his fist in time to the rhythm he gives the
stale words. But, in spite of himself, his attention wanders, his
eyes have an uneasy, hunted look, he starts at every sound in the
house or from the street. Finally, he remains rigid, Blackstone
forgotten, his eyes fixed on the porti&egrave;res with tense
grief. Then he groans, slams the book shut, goes to the window
and throws it open and sinks down beside it,</i> <i>his arms on
the sill, his head resting wearily on his arms, staring out into
the night, the pale glare from the arc-lamp on the corner
throwing his face into relief. The porti&egrave;res on the right
are parted and Hattie comes in.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>not seeing him at the table</i>) Jim!
(<i>discovering him</i>) Oh, there you are. What're you
doing?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>turning to her</i>) Resting. Cooling my head.
(<i>forcing a smile</i>) These law books certainly are a sweating
proposition! (<i>then, anxiously</i>) How is she?</p>

<p>HATTIE--She's asleep now. I felt it was safe to leave her for
a minute. (<i>after a pause</i>) What did the doctor tell you,
Jim?</p>

<p>JIM--The same old thing. She must have rest, he says, her mind
needs rest--(<i>bitterly</i>) But he can't tell me any
prescription for that rest--leastways not any that'd work.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>after a pause</i>) I think you ought to leave her,
Jim--or let her leave you--for a while, anyway.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>angrily</i>) You're like the doctor. Everything's so
simple and easy. Do this and that happens. Only it don't. Life
isn't simple like that--not in this case, anyway--no, it isn't
simple a bit. (<i>after a pause</i>) I can't leave her. She can't
leave me. And there's a million little reasons combining to make
one big reason why we can't. (<i>a pause</i>) For her sake--if
it'd do her good--I'd go--I'd leave--I'd do anything--because I
love her. I'd kill myself even--jump out of this window this
second--I've thought it over, too--but that'd only make matters
worse for her. I'm all she's got in the world! Yes, that isn't
bragging or fooling myself. I know that for a fact! Don't you
know that's true? (<i>There is a pleading for the certainty he
claims.</i>)</p>

<p>HATTIE--Yes, I know she loves you, Jim. I know that now.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>simply</i>) Then we've got to stick together to the
end, haven't we, whatever comes--and hope and pray for the best?
(<i>a pause--then hopefully</i>) I think maybe this is the crisis
in her mind. Once she settles this in herself, she's won to the
other side. And me--once I become a Member of the Bar--then I
win, too! We're both free--by our own fighting down our own
weakness! We're both really, truly free! Then we can be happy
with ourselves here or anywhere. She'll be proud then! Yes, she's
told me again and again, she says she'll be actually proud!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>turning away to conceal her emotion</i>) Yes, I'm
sure--but you mustn't study too hard, Jim! You mustn't study too
awfully hard!</p>

<p>Jim--(<i>gets up and goes to the table and sits down
wearily</i>) Yes, I know. Oh, I'll pass easily. I haven't got any
scarey feeling about that any more. And I'm doing two years' work
in one here alone. That's better than schools, eh?</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>doubtfully</i>) It's wonderful, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>his spirit evaporating</i>) If I can only hold out!
It's hard! I'm worn out. I don't sleep. I get to thinking and
thinking. My head aches and burns like fire with thinking. Round
and round my thoughts go chasing like crazy chickens hopping and
flapping before the wind. It gets me crazy mad--'cause I can't
stop!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>watching him for a while and seeming to force
herself to speak</i>) The doctor didn't tell you all, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>dully</i>) What's that?</p>

<p>HATTIE--He told me you're liable to break down too, if you
don't take care of yourself.</p>

<p>Jim--(<i>abjectly weary</i>) Let 'er come! I don't care what
happens to me. Maybe if I get sick she'll get well. There's only
so much bad luck allowed to one family, maybe. (<i>He forces a
wan smile.</i>)</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>hastily</i>) Don't give in to that idea, for the
Lord's sake!</p>

<p>JIM--I'm tired--and blue--that's all.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>after another long pause</i>) I've got to tell you
something else, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>dully</i>) What?</p>

<p>HATTIE--The doctor said Ella's liable to be sick like this a
very long time.</p>

<p>JIM--He told me that too--that it'd be a long time before she
got back her normal strength. Well, I suppose that's got to be
expected.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>slowly</i>) He didn't mean convalescing--what he
told me. (<i>a long pause</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>evasively</i>) I'm going to get other doctors in to
see Ella--specialists. This one's a damn fool.</p>

<p>HATTIE--Be sensible, Jim. You'll have to face the
truth--sooner or later.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>irritably</i>) I know the truth about Ella better'n
any doctor.</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>persuasively</i>) She'd get better so much sooner
if you'd send her away to some nice sanitarium--</p>

<p>JIM--No! She'd die of shame there!</p>

<p>HATTIE--At least until after you've taken your
examinations--</p>

<p>JIM--To hell with me!</p>

<p>HATTIE--Six months. That wouldn't be long to be parted.</p>

<p>JIM--What are you trying to do--separate us? (<i>He gets to
his feet--furiously</i>) Go on out! Go on out!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>calmly</i>) No, I won't. (<i>sharply</i>) There's
something that's got to be said to you and I'm the only one with
the courage--(<i>intensely</i>) Tell me, Jim, have you heard her
raving when she's out of her mind?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>with a shudder</i>) No!</p>

<p>HATTIE--You're lying, Jim. You must have--if you don't stop
your ears--and the doctor says she may develop a violent mania,
dangerous for you--get worse and worse until--Jim, you'll go
crazy too--living this way. Today she raved on about "Black!
Black!" and cried because she said her skin was turning
black--that you had poisoned her--</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>in anguish</i>) That's only when she's out of her
mind.</p>

<p>HATTIE--And then she suddenly called me a dirty nigger.</p>

<p>JIM--No! She never said that ever! She never would!</p>

<p>HATTIE--She did--and kept on and on! (<i>a tense pause</i>)
She'll be saying that to you soon.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>torturedly</i>) She don't mean it! She isn't
responsible for what she's saying!</p>

<p>HATTIE--I know she isn't--yet she is just the same. It's deep
down in her or it wouldn't come out.</p>

<p>JIM--Deep down in her people--not deep in her.</p>

<p>HATTIE--I can't make such distinctions. The race in me, deep
in me, can't stand it. I can't play nurse to her any more,
Jim,--not even for your sake. I'm afraid--afraid of
myself--afraid sometime I'll kill her dead to set you free!
(<i>She loses control and begins to cry.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>after a long pause--somberly</i>) Yes, I guess you'd
better stay away from here. Good-by.</p>

<p>HATTIE--Who'll you get to nurse her, Jim,--a white woman?</p>

<p>JIM--Ella'd die of shame. No, I'll nurse her myself.</p>

<p>HATTIE--And give up your studies?</p>

<p>JIM--I can do both.</p>

<p>HATTIE--You can't! You'll get sick yourself! Why, you look
terrible even as it is--and it's only beginning!</p>

<p>JIM--I can do anything for her! I'm all she's got in the
world! I've got to prove I can be all to her! I've got to prove
worthy! I've got to prove she can be proud of me! I've got to
prove I'm the whitest of the white!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>stung by this last--with rebellious
bitterness</i>) Is that the ambition she's given you? Oh, you
soft, weak-minded fool, you traitor to your race! And the thanks
you'll get--to be called a dirty nigger--to hear her cursing you
because she can never have a child because it'll be born
black--!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>in a frenzy</i>) Stop!</p>

<p>HATTIE--I'll say what must be said even though you kill me,
Jim. Send her to an asylum before you both have to be sent to one
together.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>with a sudden wild laugh</i>) Do you think you're
threatening me with something dreadful now? Why, I'd like that.
Sure, I'd like that! Maybe she'd like it better, too. Maybe we'd
both find it all simple then--like you think it is now. Yes.
(<i>He laughs again.</i>)</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>frightenedly</i>) Jim!</p>

<p>JIM--Together! You can't scare me even with hell fire if you
say she and I go together. It's heaven then for me! (<i>with
sudden savagery</i>) You go out of here! All you've ever been
aiming to do is to separate us so we can't be together!</p>

<p>HATTIE--I've done what I did for your own good.</p>

<p>JIM--I have no own good. I only got a good together with her.
I'm all she's got in the world! Let her call me nigger! Let her
call me the whitest of the white! I'm all she's got in the world,
ain't I? She's all I've got! You with your fool talk of the black
race and the white race! Where does the human race get a chance
to come in? I suppose that's simple for you. You lock it up in
asylums and throw away the key! (<i>with fresh</i>
<i>violence</i>) Go along! There isn't going to be no more people
coming in here to separate--excepting the doctor. I'm going to
lock the door and it's going to stay locked, you hear? Go along,
now!</p>

<p>HATTIE--(<i>confusedly</i>) Jim!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>pushes her out gently and slams the door after
her--vaguely</i>) Go along! I got to study. I got to nurse Ella,
too. Oh, I can do it! I can do anything for her! (<i>He sits down
at the table and, opening the book, begins again to recite the
line from Blackstone in a meaningless rhythm, tapping his
forehead with his fist. Ella enters noiselessly through the
porti&egrave;res. She wears a red dressing-gown over her
night-dress but is in her bare feet. She has a carving-knife in
her right hand. Her eyes fasten on Jim with a murderous mania.
She creeps up behind him. Suddenly he senses something and turns.
As he sees her he gives a cry, jumping up and catching her wrist.
She stands fixed, her eyes growing bewildered and
frightened.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>aghast</i>) Ella! For God's sake! Do you want to
murder me? (<i>She does not answer. He shakes her.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>whimperingly</i>) They kept calling me names as I
was walking along--I can't tell you what, Jim--and then I grabbed
a knife--</p>

<p>JIM--Yes! See! This! (<i>She looks at it
frightenedly.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--Where did I--? I was having a nightmare--Where did they
go--I mean, how did I get here? (<i>with sudden terrified
pleading--like a little girl</i>) Oh, Jim--don't ever leave me
alone! I have such terrible dreams, Jim--promise you'll never go
away!</p>

<p>JIM--I promise, Honey.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>her manner becoming more and more childishly
silly</i>) I'll be a little girl--and you'll be old Uncle Jim
who's been with us for years and years--Will you play that?</p>

<p>JIM--Yes, Honey. Now you better go back to bed.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>like a child</i>) Yes, Uncle Jim. (<i>She turns to
go. He pretends to be occupied by his book. She looks at him for
a second--then suddenly asks in her natural woman's voice</i>)
Are you studying hard, Jim?</p>

<p>JIM--Yes, Honey. Go to bed now. You need to rest, you
know.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>stands looking at him, fighting with herself. A
startling transformation comes over her face. It grows mean,
vicious, full of jealous hatred. She cannot contain herself but
breaks out harshly with a cruel, venomous grin</i>) You dirty
nigger!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>starting as if he'd been shot</i>) Ella! For the good
Lord's sake!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>coming out of her insane mood for a moment, aware of
something terrible, frightened</i>) Jim! Jim! Why are you looking
at me like that?</p>

<p>JIM--What did you say to me just then?</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>gropingly</i>) Why, I--I said--I remember saying,
are you studying hard, Jim? Why? You're not mad at that, are
you?</p>

<p>JIM--No, Honey. What made you think I was mad? Go to bed
now.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>obediently</i>) Yes, Jim. (<i>She passes behind the
porti&egrave;res. Jim stares before him. Suddenly her head is
thrust out at the side of the porti&egrave;res. Her face is again
that of a vindictive maniac.</i>) Nigger! (<i>The face
disappears--she can be heard running away, laughing with cruel
satisfaction. Jim bows his head on his outstretched arms but he
is too stricken for tears.</i>)</p>

<h2><a name="s203">SCENE THREE</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The same, six months later. The sun has just gone down. The
Spring twilight sheds a vague, gray light about the room, picking
out the Congo mask on the stand by the window. The walls appear
shrunken in still more, the ceiling now seems barely to clear the
people's heads, the furniture and the characters appear
enormously magnified. Law books are stacked in two great piles on
each side of the table. Ella comes in from the right, the
carving-knife in her hand. She is pitifully thin, her face is
wasted, but her eyes glow with a mad energy, her movements are
abrupt and spring-like. She looks stealthily about the room, then
advances and stands before the mask, her arms akimbo, her
attitude one of crazy mockery, fear and bravado. She is dressed
in the red dressing-gown, grown dirty and ragged now, and is in
her bare feet.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>ELLA--I'll give you the laugh, wait and see! (<i>then in a
confidential tone</i>) He thought I was asleep! He called, Ella,
Ella--but I kept my eyes shut, I pretended to snore. I fooled him
good. (<i>She gives a little hoarse laugh.</i>) This is the first
time he's dared to leave me alone for months and months. I've
been wanting to talk to you every day but this is the only
chance--(<i>with sudden violence--flourishing her knife</i>)
What're you grinning about, you dirty nigger, you? How dare you
grin at me? I guess you forget what you are! That's always the
way. Be kind to you, treat you decent, and in a second you've got
a swelled head, you think you're somebody, you're all over the
place putting on airs; why, it's got so I can't even walk down
the street without seeing niggers, niggers everywhere. Hanging
around, grinning, grinning--going to school--pretending they're
white--taking examinations--(<i>She stops, arrested by the word,
then suddenly</i>) That's where he's gone--down to the
mail-box--to see if there's a letter from the Board--telling
him--But why is he so long? (<i>She calls pitifully</i>) Jim!
(<i>then in a terrified whimper</i>) Maybe he's passed! Maybe
he's passed! (<i>in a frenzy</i>) No! No! He can't! I'd kill him!
I'd kill myself! (<i>threatening the Congo mask</i>) It's you
who're to blame for this! Yes, you! Oh, I'm on to you! (<i>then
appealingly</i>) But why d'you want to do this to us? What have I
ever done wrong to you? What have you got against me? I married
you, didn't I? Why don't you let Jim alone? Why don't you let him
be happy as he is--with me? Why don't you let me be happy? He's
white, isn't he--the whitest man that ever lived? Where do you
come in to interfere? Black! Black! Black as dirt! You've
poisoned me! I can't wash myself clean! Oh, I hate you! I hate
you! Why don't you let Jim and I be happy? (<i>She sinks down in
his chair, her arms outstretched on the table. The door from the
hall is slowly opened and Jim appears. His bloodshot, sleepless
eyes stare from deep hollows. His expression is one of crushed
numbness. He holds an open letter in his hand.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>seeing Ella--in an absolutely dead voice</i>)
Honey--I thought you were asleep.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>starts and wheels about in her chair</i>) What's
that? You got--you got a letter--?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>turning to close the door after him</i>) From the
Board of Examiners for admission to the Bar, State of New
York--God's country! (<i>He finishes up with a chuckle of ironic
self-pity so spent as to be barely audible.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>writhing out of her chair like some fierce animal,
the knife held behind her--with fear and hatred</i>) You
didn't--you didn't--you didn't pass, did you?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>looking at her wildly</i>) Pass? Pass? (<i>He begins
to chuckle and laugh between sentences and phrases, rich, Negro
laughter, but heart-breaking in its mocking grief.</i>) Good
Lord, child, how come you can ever imagine such a crazy idea?
Pass? Me? Jim Crow Harris? Nigger Jim Harris--become a
full-fledged Member of the Bar! Why the mere notion of it is
enough to kill you with laughing! It'd be against all natural
laws, all human right and justice. It'd be miraculous, there'd be
earthquakes and catastrophes, the seven Plagues'd come again and
locusts'd devour all the money in the banks, the second Flood'd
come roaring and Noah'd fall overboard, the sun'd drop out of the
sky like a ripe fig, and the Devil'd perform miracles, and God'd
be tipped head first right out of the Judgment seat! (<i>He
laughs, maudlinly uproarious.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>her face beginning to relax, to light up</i>) Then
you--you didn't pass?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>spent--giggling and gasping idiotically</i>) Well, I
should say not! I should certainly say not!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>With a cry of joy, pushes all the law books crashing
to the floor--then with childish happiness she grabs Jim by both
hands and dances up and down.</i>) Oh, Jim, I knew it! I knew you
couldn't! Oh, I'm so glad, Jim! I'm so happy! You're still my old
Jim--and I'm so glad! (<i>He looks at her dazedly, a fierce rage
slowly gathering on his face. She dances away from him. His eyes
follow her. His hands clench. She stands in front of the
mask--triumphantly</i>) There! What did I tell you? I told you
I'd give you the laugh! (<i>She begins to laugh with wild
unrestraint, grabs the mask from its place, sets it in the middle
of the table and plunging the knife down through it pins it to
the table.</i>) There! Who's got the laugh now?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>his eyes bulging--hoarsely</i>) You devil! You white
devil woman! (<i>in a terrible roar, raising his fists above her
head</i>) You devil!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>looking up at him with a bewildered cry of
terror</i>) Jim! (<i>Her appeal recalls him to himself. He lets
his arms slowly drop to his sides, bowing his head. Ella points
tremblingly to the mask.</i>) It's all right, Jim! It's dead. The
devil's dead. See! It couldn't live--unless you passed. If you'd
passed it would have lived in you. Then I'd have had to kill you,
Jim, don't you see?--or it would have killed me. But now I've
killed it. (<i>She pats his hand.</i>) So you needn't ever be
afraid any more, Jim.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>dully</i>) I've got to sit down, Honey. I'm tired. I
haven't had much chance for sleep in so long--(<i>He slumps down
in the chair by the table.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>sits down on the floor beside him and holds his
hand. Her face is gradually regaining an expression that is
happy, childlike and pretty.</i>) I know, Jim! That was my fault.
I wouldn't let you sleep. I couldn't let you. I kept thinking if
he sleeps good then he'll be sure to study good and then he'll
pass--and the devil'll win!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>with a groan</i>) Don't, Honey!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>with a childish grin</i>) That was why I carried
that knife around--(<i>she frowns--puzzled</i>)--one reason--to
keep you from studying and sleeping by scaring you.</p>

<p>JIM--I wasn't scared of being killed. I was scared of what
they'd do to you after.</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>after a pause--like a child</i>) Will God forgive
me, Jim?</p>

<p>JIM--Maybe He can forgive what you've done to me; and maybe He
can forgive what I've done to you; but I don't see how He's going
to forgive--Himself.</p>

<p>ELLA--I prayed and prayed. When you were away taking the
examinations and I was alone with the nurse, I closed my eyes and
pretended to be asleep but I was praying with all my might: O
God, don't let Jim pass!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>with a sob</i>) Don't, Honey, don't! For the good
Lord's sake! You're hurting me!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>frightenedly</i>) How, Jim? Where? (<i>then after a
pause--suddenly</i>) I'm sick, Jim. I don't think I'll live
long.</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>simply</i>) Then I won't either. Somewhere yonder
maybe--together--our luck'll change. But I wanted--here and
now--before you--we--I wanted to prove to you--to myself--to
become a full-fledged Member--so you could be proud--(<i>He
stops. Words fail and he is beyond tears.</i>)</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>brightly</i>) Well, it's all over, Jim.
Everything'll be all right now. (<i>chattering along</i>) I'll be
just your little girl, Jim--and you'll be my little boy--just as
we used to be, remember, when we were beaux; and I'll put shoe
blacking on my face and pretend I'm black and you can put chalk
on your face and pretend you're white just as we used to do--and
we can play marbles--only you mustn't all the time be a boy.
Sometimes you must be my old kind Uncle Jim who's been with us
for years and years. Will you, Jim?</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>with utter resignation</i>) Yes, Honey.</p>

<p>ELLA--And you'll never, never, never, never leave me, Jim?</p>

<p>JIM--Never, Honey.</p>

<p>ELLA--'Cause you're all I've got in the world--and I love you,
Jim. (<i>She kisses his hand as a child might, tenderly and
gratefully.</i>)</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>suddenly throws himself on his knees and raises his
shining eyes, his transfigured face</i>) Forgive me, God--and
make me worthy! Now I see Your Light again! Now I hear Your
Voice! (<i>He begins to weep in an ecstasy of religious
humility.</i>) Forgive me, God, for blaspheming You! Let this
fire of burning suffering purify me of selfishness and make me
worthy of the child You send me for the woman You take away!</p>

<p>ELLA--(<i>jumping to her feet--excitedly</i>) Don't cry, Jim!
You mustn't cry! I've got only a little time left and I want to
play. Don't be old Uncle Jim now. Be my little boy, Jim. Pretend
you're Painty Face and I'm Jim Crow. Come and play!</p>

<p>JIM--(<i>still deeply exalted</i>) Honey, Honey, I'll play
right up to the gates of Heaven with you! (<i>She tugs at one of
his hands, laughingly trying to pull him up from his knees
as</i></p>
