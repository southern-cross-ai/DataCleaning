<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Parlor of the Crosby home. The room is small and
low-ceilinged. Everything has an aspect of scrupulous neatness.
On the left, forward, a stiff plush-covered chair. Farther back,
in order, a window looking out on a vegetable garden, a black
horsehair sofa, and another window. In the far left corner, an
old mahogany chest of drawers. To the right of it, in rear, a
window looking out on the front yard. To the right of this window
is the front door, reached by a dirt path through the small lawn
which separates the house from the street. To the right of door,
another window. In the far right corner, a diminutive,
old-fashioned piano with a stool in front of it. Near the piano
on the right, a door leading to the next room. On this side of
the room are also a small bookcase half filled with old volumes,
a big open fireplace, and another plush-covered chair. Over the
fireplace a mantel with a marble clock and a Rogers group. The
walls are papered a brown color. The floor is covered with a dark
carpet. In the center of the room there is a clumsy,
marble-topped table. On the table, a large china lamp, a bulky
Bible with a brass clasp, and several books that look
suspiciously like cheap novels. Near the table, three
plush-covered chairs, two of which are rockers. Several enlarged
photos of strained, stern-looking people in uncomfortable poses
are hung on the walls.</i></p>

<p><i>It is mid-afternoon of a fine day in late spring of the
year 1890. Bright sunlight streams through the windows on the
left. Through the window and the screen door in the rear the
fresh green of the lawn and of the elm trees that line the street
can be seen. Stiff, white curtains are at all the
windows.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, Emma Crosby and Caleb Williams are
discovered. Emma is a slender girl of twenty, rather under the
medium height. Her face, in spite of its plain features, gives an
impression of prettiness, due to her large, soft blue eyes which
have an incongruous quality of absent-minded romantic dreaminess
about them. Her mouth and chin are heavy, full of a self-willed
stubbornness. Although her body is slight and thin, there is a
quick, nervous vitality about all her movements that reveals an
underlying constitution of reserve power and health. She has
light</i> <i>brown hair, thick and heavy. She is dressed soberly
and neatly in her black Sunday best, style of the period.</i></p>

<p><i>Caleb Williams is tall and powerfully built, about thirty.
Black hair, keen, dark eyes, face rugged and bronzed, mouth
obstinate but good-natured. He, also, is got up in black Sunday
best and is uncomfortably self-conscious and stiff
therein.</i></p>

<p><i>They are sitting on the horsehair sofa, side by side. His
arm is about her waist. She holds one of his big hands in both of
hers, her head leaning back against his shoulder, her eyes half
closed in a dreamy contentedness. He stares before him rigidly,
his whole attitude wooden and fixed as if he were posing for a
photograph; yet his eyes are expressively tender and protecting
when he glances down at her diffidently out of the corners
without moving his head.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>sighing happily</i>) Gosh, I wish we could sit this
way forever! (<i>then after a pause, as he makes no comment
except a concurring squeeze</i>) Don't you, Caleb?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with another squeeze--emphatically</i>) Hell, yes!
I'd like it, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>softly</i>) I do wish you wouldn't swear so awful
much, Caleb.</p>

<p>CALEB--S'cuse me, Emmer, it jumped out o' my mouth afore I
thought. (<i>then with a grin</i>) You'd ought to be used to that
part o' men's wickedness--with your Pa and Jack cussin' about the
house all the time.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with a smile</i>) Oh, I haven't no strict religious
notions about it. I'm hardened in sin so far's they're concerned.
Goodness me, how would Ma and me ever have lived in the same
house with them two if we wasn't used to it? I don't even notice
their cussing no more. And I don't mind hearing it from the other
men, either. Being sea-faring men, away from their women folks
most of the time, I know it just gets to be part of their natures
and they ain't responsible. (<i>decisively</i>) But you're
diff'rent. You just got to be diff'rent from the rest.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>amused by her seriousness</i>) Diff'rent? Ain't I a
sea-farin' man, too?</p>

<p>EMMA--You're diff'rent just the same. That's what made me fall
in love with you 'stead of any of them. And you've got to stay
diff'rent. Promise me, Caleb, that you'll always stay diff'rent
from them--even after we're married years and years.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>embarrassed</i>) Why--I promise to do my best by
you, Emmer. You know that, don't ye? On'y don't git the notion in
your head I'm any better'n the rest. They're all good men--most
of 'em, anyway. Don't tell me, for instance, you think I'm
better'n your Pa or Jack--'cause I ain't. And I don't know as I'd
want to be, neither.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>excitedly</i>) But you got to want to be--when I ask
it.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>surprised</i>) Better'n your Pa?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>struggling to convey her meaning</i>) Why, Pa's all
right. He's a fine man--and Jack's all right, too. I wouldn't
hear a bad word about them for anything. And the others are all
right in their way, too, I s'pose. Only--don't you see what I
mean?--I look on you as diff'rent from all of them. I mean
there's things that's all right for them to do that wouldn't be
for you--in my mind, anyway.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>puzzled and a bit uneasy</i>) Sailors ain't plaster
saints, Emmer,--not a darn one of 'em ain't!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>hurt and disappointed</i>) Then you won't promise me
to stay diff'rent for my sake?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with rough tenderness</i>) Oh, hell, Emmer, I'll do
any cussed thing in the world you want me to, and you know
it!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>lovingly</i>) Thank you, Caleb. It means a lot to
me--more'n you think. And don't you think I'm diff'rent, too--not
just the same as all the other girls hereabouts?</p>

<p>CALEB--'Course you be! Ain't I always said that? You're wo'th
the whole pack of 'em put together.</p>

<p>EMMA--Oh, I don't mean I'm any better. I mean I just look at
things diff'rent from what they do--getting married, for example,
and other things, too. And so I've got it fixed in my head that
you and me ought to make a married couple--diff'rent from the
rest--not that they ain't all right in their way.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>puzzled</i><b>--</b><i>uncertainly</i>) Waal--it's
bound to be from your end of it, you bein' like you are. But I
ain't so sure o' mine.</p>

<p>EMMA--Well, I am!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with a grin</i>) You got me scared, Emmer. I'm
scared you'll want me to live up to one of them high-fangled
heroes you been readin' about in them books. (<i>He indicates the
novels on the table.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--No, I don't. I want you to be just like yourself, that's
all.</p>

<p>CALEB--That's easy. It ain't hard bein' a plain, ordinary
cuss.</p>

<p>EMMA--You are not!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with a laugh</i>) Remember, I'm warnin' you, Emmer;
and after we're married and you find me out, you can't say I got
you under no false pretenses.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>laughing</i>) I won't. I won't ever need to.
(<i>then after a pause</i>) Just think, it's only two days more
before you and me'll be man and wife.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>squeezing her</i>) Waal, it's about time, ain't
it?--after waitin' three years for me to git enough money
saved--and us not seein' hide or hair of each other the last two
of 'em. (<i>with a laugh</i>) Shows ye what trust I put in you,
Emmer, when I kin go off on a two year whalin' vige and leave you
all 'lone for all the young fellers in town to make eyes at.</p>

<p>EMMA--But lots and lots of the others does the same thing
without thinking nothing about it.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with a laugh</i>) Yes, but I'm diff'rent, like you
says.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>laughing</i>) Oh, you're poking fun now.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with a wink</i>) And you know as well's me that
some o' the others finds out some funny things that's been done
when they was away.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>laughing at first</i>) Yes, but you know I'm
diff'rent, too. (<i>then frowning</i>) But don't let's talk about
that sort o' ructions. I hate to think of such things--even
joking. I ain't like that sort.</p>

<p>CALEB--Thunder, I know you ain't, Emmer. I was on'y
jokin'.</p>

<p>EMMA--And I never doubted you them two years; and I won't when
you sail away again, neither.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with a twinkle in his eye</i>) No, even a woman'd
find it hard to git jealous of a whale!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>laughing</i>) I wasn't thinking of whales, silly!
But there's plenty of diversion going on in the ports you
touched, if you'd a mind for it.</p>

<p>CALEB--Waal, I didn't have no mind for it, that's sartin. My
fust vige as skipper, you don't s'pose I had time for no
monkey-shinin', do ye? Why, I was that anxious to bring back your
Pa's ship with a fine vige that'd make him piles o' money, I
didn't even think of nothin' else.</p>

<p>EMMA--'Cepting me, I hope?</p>

<p>CALEB--O' course! What was my big aim in doin' it if it wasn't
so's we'd git married when I come to home? And then, s'far as
ports go, we didn't tech at one the last year--'ceptin' when that
durn tempest blowed us south and we put in at one o' the Islands
for water.</p>

<p>EMMA--What island? You never told me nothing about that.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>growing suddenly very embarrassed as if some memory
occurred to him</i>) Ain't nothin' to tell, that's why. Just an
island near the Line, that's all. O'ny naked heathen livin'
there--brown colored savages that ain't even Christians. (<i>He
gets to his feet abruptly and pulls out his watch.</i>) Gittin'
late, must be. I got to go down to the store and git some things
for Harriet afore I forgets 'em.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>rising also and putting her hands on his
shoulders</i>) But you did think of me and miss me all the time
you was gone, didn't you?--same as I did you.</p>

<p>CALEB--'Course I did. Every minute.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>nestling closer to him--softly</i>) I'm glad of
that, Caleb. Well, good-by for a little while.</p>

<p>CALEB--I'll step in again for a spell afore supper--that is,
if you want me to.</p>

<p>EMMA--Yes, of course I do, Caleb. Good-by. (<i>She lifts her
face to his.</i>)</p>

<p>CALEB--Good-by, Emmer. (<i>He kisses her and holds her in his
arms for a moment. Jack comes up the walk to the screen door.
They do not notice his approach.</i>)</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>peering in and seeing them--in a joking bellow</i>)
Belay, there! (<i>They separate with startled exclamations. Jack
comes in grinning. He is a hulking, stocky-built young fellow of
25. His heavy face is sunburned, handsome in a coarse,
good-natured</i> <i>animal fashion. His small blue eyes twinkle
with the unconsciously malicious humor of the born practical
joker. He wears high seaboots turned down from the knee, dirty
cotton shirt and pants, and a yellow sou'wester pushed jauntily
on the back of his head, revealing his disheveled, curly blond
hair. He carries a string of cod heads.</i>)</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>laughing at the embarrassed expression on their
faces</i>) Caught ye that time, by gum! Go ahead! Kiss her again,
Caleb. Don't mind me.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with flurried annoyance</i>) You got a head on you
just like one of them cod heads you're carrying--that stupid! I
should think you'd be ashamed at your age--shouting to scare
folks as if you was a little boy.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>putting his arm about her waist</i>) There, kitty,
don't git to spittin'. (<i>stroking her hair</i>) Puss, puss,
puss! Nice kitty! (<i>He</i> <i>laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>forced to smile--pushing him away</i>) Get away!
You'll never get sense. Land sakes, what a brother to have!</p>

<p>JACK--Oh, I dunno. I ain't so bad, as brothers go--eh,
Caleb?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>smiling</i>) I reckon you'll do, Jack.</p>

<p>JACK--See there! Listen to Caleb. You got to take his
word--love, honor, and <i>obey,</i> ye know, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>laughing</i>) Leave it to men folks to stick up for
each other, right or wrong.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>cockily</i>) Waal, I'm willin' to leave it to the
girls, too. Ask any of 'em you knows if I ain't a jim-dandy to
have for a brother. (<i>He winks at Caleb who grins back at
him.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with a sniff</i>) I reckon you don't play much
brother with them--the kind you knows. You may fool 'em into
believing you're some pumpkins but they'd change their minds if
they had to live in the same house with you playing silly jokes
all the time.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>provokingly</i>) A good lot on 'em 'd be on'y too
damn glad to git me in the same house--if I was fool enough to
git married.</p>

<p>EMMA--"Pride goeth before a fall." But shucks, what's the good
paying any attention to you. (<i>She smiles at him
affectionately.</i>)</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>exaggeratedly</i>) You see, Caleb? See how she
misuses me--her lovin' brother. Now you know what you'll be up
against for the rest o' your natural days.</p>

<p>CALEB--Don't see no way but what I got to bear it, Jack.</p>

<p>EMMA--Caleb needn't fear. He's different.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>with a sudden guffaw</i>) Oh, hell, yes! I was
forgittin'. Caleb's a Sunday go-to-meetin' Saint, ain't he? Yes,
he is!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with real resentment</i>) He's better'n what you
are, if that's what you mean.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>with a still louder laugh</i>) Ho-ho! Caleb's one o'
them goody-goody heroes out o' them story books you're always
readin', ain't he?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>soberly--a bit disturbed</i>) I was tellin' Emmer
not to take me that high.</p>

<p>JACK--No use, Caleb. She won't hear of it. She's got her head
sot t'other way. You'd ought to heard her argyin' when you was
gone about what a parson's pet you was. Butter won't melt in your
mouth, no siree! Waal, love is blind--and deaf, too, as the
feller says--and I can't argy no more 'cause I got to give Ma
these heads. (<i>He goes to the door on right--then glances back
at his sister maliciously and says meaningly</i>) You ought to
have a talk with Jim Benson, Emmer. Oughtn't she, Caleb? (<i>He
winks ponderously and goes off laughing uproariously.</i>)</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>his face worried and angry</i>) Jack's a durn fool
at times, Emmer--even if he is your brother. He needs a good
lickin'.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>staring at him--uneasily</i>) What'd he mean about
Jim Benson, Caleb?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>frowning</i>) I don't know--ezactly. Makin' up
foolishness for a joke, I reckon.</p>

<p>EMMA--You don't know--<i>exactly</i>? Then there
is--something?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>quickly</i>) Not as I know on. On'y Jim Benson's
one o' them slick jokers, same's Jack; can't keep their mouths
shet or mind their own business.</p>

<p>EMMA--Jim Benson was mate with you this last trip, wasn't
he?</p>

<p>CALEB--Yes.</p>

<p>EMMA--Didn't him and you get along?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>a trifle impatiently</i>) 'Course we did. Jim's all
right. We got along fust rate. He just can't keep his tongue from
waggin', that's all's the matter with him.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>uneasily</i>) What's it got to wag about? You ain't
done nothing wrong, have you?</p>

<p>CALEB--Wrong? No, nothin' a man'd rightly call wrong.</p>

<p>EMMA--Nothing you'd be shamed to tell me?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>awkwardly</i>) Why--no, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>pleadingly</i>) You'd swear that, Caleb?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>hesitating for a second--then firmly</i>) Yes, I'd
swear. I'd own up to everything fair and square I'd ever done, if
it comes to that p'int. I ain't shamed o' anything I ever done,
Emmer. On'y--women folks ain't got to know everything, have
they?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>turning away from him--frightenedly</i>) Oh,
Caleb!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>preoccupied with his own thoughts--going to the
door in rear</i>) I'll see you later, Emmer. I got to go up
street now more'n ever. I want to give that Jim Benson a talkin'
to he won't forgit in a hurry--that is, if he's been tellin'
tales. Good-by, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>faintly</i>) Good-by, Caleb. (<i>He goes out. She
sits in one of the rockers by the table, her face greatly
troubled, her manner nervous and uneasy. Finally she makes a
decision, goes quickly to the door on the right and calls</i>)
Jack! Jack!</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>from the kitchen</i>) What you want?</p>

<p>EMMA--Come here a minute, will you?</p>

<p>JACK--Jest a second. (<i>She comes back by the table, fighting
to conceal her agitation. After a moment, Jack comes in from the
right. He has evidently been washing up, for his face is red and
shiny, his hair wet and slicked in a part. He looks around for
Caleb.</i>) Where's Caleb?</p>

<p>EMMA--He had to go up street. (<i>then coming to the point
abruptly--with feigned indifference</i>) What's that joke about
Jim Benson, Jack? It seemed to get Caleb all riled up.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>with a chuckle</i>) You got to ask Caleb about that,
Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--I did. He didn't seem to want to own up it was
anything.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>with a laugh</i>) 'Course he wouldn't. He don't
'preciate a joke when it's on him.</p>

<p>EMMA--How'd you come to hear of it?</p>

<p>JACK--From Jim. Met him this afternoon and me and him had a
long talk. He was tellin' me all 'bout their vige.</p>

<p>EMMA--Then it was on the vige this joke happened?</p>

<p>JACK--Yes. It was when they put in to git water at them South
Sea Islands where the tempest blowed 'em.</p>

<p>EMMA--Oh. (<i>suspiciously</i>) Caleb didn't seem willing to
tell me much about their touching there.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>chuckling</i>) 'Course he didn't. Wasn't I sayin'
the joke's on him? (<i>coming closer to her--in a low,
confidential tone, chucklingly</i>) We'll fix up a joke on Caleb,
Emmer, what d'ye say?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>tortured by foreboding--resolved to find out what is
back of all this by hook or crook--forcing a smile</i>) All
right, Jack. I'm willing.</p>

<p>JACK--Then I'll tell you what Jim told me. And you put it up
to Caleb, see, and pertend you're madder'n hell. (<i>unable to
restrain his mirth</i>) Ho-ho! It'll git him wild if you do that.
On'y I didn't tell ye, mind. You heard it from someone else. I
don't want to git Caleb down on me. And you'd hear about it from
someone sooner or later 'cause Jim and the rest o' the boys has
been tellin' the hull town.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>taken aback--frowning</i>) So all the town knows
about it?</p>

<p>JACK--Yes, and they're all laffin' at Caleb. Oh, it ain't
nothin' so out o' the ordinary. Most o' the whalin' men hereabout
have run up against it in their time. I've heard Pa and all the
others tellin' stories like it out o' their experience. On'y with
Caleb it ended up so damn funny! (<i>He laughs.</i>) Ho-ho!
Jimminy!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>in a strained voice</i>) Well, ain't you going to
tell me?</p>

<p>JACK--I'm comin' to it. Waal, seems like they all went ashore
on them islands to git water and the native brown women, all
naked a'most, come round to meet 'em same as they always
does--wantin' to swap for terbaccer and other tradin' stuff with
straw mats and whatever other junk they got. Them brown gals was
purty as the devil, Jim says--that is, in their heathen,
outlandish way--and the boys got makin' up to 'em; and then, o'
course, everything happened like it always does, and even after
they'd got all the water they needed aboard, it took 'em a week
to round up all hands from where they was foolin' about with them
nigger women.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>in anguish</i>) Yes--but Caleb--he ain't like them
others. He's diff'rent.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>with a sly wink</i>) Oho, is he? I'm comin' to
Caleb. Waal, seems 's if he kept aboard mindin' his own business
and winkin' at what the boys was doin'. And one o' them gals--the
purtiest on 'em, Jim says--she kept askin', where's the captain?
She wouldn't have nothin' to do with any o' the others. She
thought on'y the skipper was good enough for her, I reckon. So
one night jest afore they sailed some o' the boys, bein' drunk on
native rum they'd stole, planned to put up a joke on Caleb and on
that brown gal, too. So they tells her the captain had sent for
her and she was to swim right out and git aboard the ship where
he was waitin' for her alone. That part of it was true enough
'cause Caleb was alone, all hands havin' deserted, you might
say.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>letting an involuntary exclamation escape her</i>)
Oh!</p>

<p>JACK--Waal, that fool brown gal b'lieved 'em and she swum
right off, tickled to death. What happened between 'em when she
got aboard, nobody knows. Some thinks one thing and some another.
And I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout it--(<i>with a wink</i>) but I
know damn well what I'd 'a done in Caleb's boots, and I guess he
ain't the cussed old woman you makes him out. But that part of
it's got nothin' to do with the joke nohow. The joke's this: that
brown gal took an awful shine to Caleb and when she saw the ship
was gittin' ready to sail she raised ructions, standin' on the
beach howlin' and screamin', and beatin' her chest with her
fists. And when they ups anchors, she dives in the water and
swims out after 'em. There's no wind hardly and she kin swim like
a fish and catches up to 'em and tries to climb aboard. At fust,
Caleb tries to treat her gentle and argy with her to go back. But
she won't listen, she gits wilder and wilder, and finally he gits
sick of it and has the boys push her off with oars while he goes
and hides in the cabin. Even this don't work. She keeps swimmin'
round and yellin' for Caleb. And finally they has to p'int a gun
at her and shoot in the water near her afore the crazy cuss gives
up and swims back to home, howlin' all the time. (<i>with a,
chuckle</i>) And Caleb lyin' low in the cabin skeered to move
out, and all hands splittin' their sides! Gosh, I wish I'd been
there! It must have been funnier'n hell! (<i>He laughs
loudly--then noticing his sister's stony expression, stops
abruptly.</i>) What're you pullin' that long face for, Emmer?
(<i>offendedly</i>) Hell, you're a nice one to tell a joke
to!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>after a pause--forcing the words out slowly</i>)
Caleb's comin' back here, Jack. I want you to see him for me. I
want you to tell him--</p>

<p>JACK--Not me! You got to play this joke on him yourself or it
won't work.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>tensely</i>) This ain't a joke, Jack--what I mean. I
want you to tell him I've changed my mind and I ain't going to
marry him.</p>

<p>JACK--What!</p>

<p>EMMA--I been thinking things over, tell him--and I take back
my promise--and he can have back his ring--and I ain't going to
marry him.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>flabbergasted--peering into her face anxiously</i>)
Say--what the hell--? Are you tryin' to josh me, Emmer? Or are
you gone crazy all of a sudden?</p>

<p>EMMA--I ain't joking nor crazy neither. You tell him what I
said.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>vehemently</i>) I will like--Say, what's come over
you, anyhow?</p>

<p>EMMA--My eyes are opened, that's all, and I ain't going to
marry him.</p>

<p>JACK--Is it--'count of that joke about Caleb I was tellin'
you?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>her voice trembling</i>) It's 'count of something I
got in my own head. What you told only goes to prove I was wrong
about it.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>greatly perturbed now</i>) Say, what's the matter?
Can't you take a joke? Are you mad at him 'count o' that brown
gal?</p>

<p>EMMA--Yes, I am--and I ain't going to marry him and that's all
there is to it.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>argumentatively</i>) Jealous of a brown, heathen
woman that ain't no better'n a nigger? God sakes, Emmer, I didn't
think you was that big a fool. Why, them kind o' women ain't
women like you. They don't count like folks. They ain't
Christians--nor nothin'!</p>

<p>EMMA--That ain't it. I don't care what they are.</p>

<p>JACK--And it wasn't Caleb anyhow. It was all her fixin'. And
how'd you know he had anything to do with her--like that? I ain't
said he did. Jim couldn't swear he did neither. And even if he
did--what difference does it make? It ain't rightly none o' your
business what he does on a vige. He didn't ask her to marry him,
did he?</p>

<p>EMMA--I don't care. He'd ought to have acted diff'rent.</p>

<p>JACK--Oh golly, there you go agen makin' a durned
creepin'-Jesus out of him! What d'you want to marry, anyhow--a
man or a sky-pilot? Caleb's a man, ain't he?--and a damn good man
and as smart a skipper as there be in these parts! What more
d'you want, anyhow?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>violently</i>) I want you to shet up! You're too
dumb stupid and bad yourself to ever know what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>resentfully</i>) Go to the devil, then! I'm goin' to
tell Ma and sic her onto you. You'll maybe listen to her and git
some sense. (<i>He stamps out, right, while he is speaking. Emma
bursts into sobs and throws herself on a chair, covering her face
with her hands. Harriet Williams and Alfred Rogers come up the
path to the door in rear. Peering through the screen and catching
sight of Emma, Harriet calls</i> Emmer! <i>Emma leaps to her feet
and dabs at her eyes with a handkerchief in a vain effort to
conceal traces of her tears. Harriet has come in, followed by
Rogers. Caleb's sister is a tall, dark girl of twenty. Her face
is plainly homely and yet attracts the eye by a certain
boldly-appealing vitality of self-confident youth. She wears an
apron and has evidently just come out of the kitchen. Rogers is a
husky young fisherman of twenty-four, washed and slicked up in
his ill-fitting best.</i>)</p>

<p>ROGERS--Hello, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>huskily, trying to force a smile</i>) Hello,
Harriet. Hello, Alfred. Won't you set?</p>

<p>HARRIET--No, I jest run over from the house a second to see
if--Where's Caleb, Emmer?</p>

<p>EMMA--He's gone up street.</p>

<p>HARRIET--And here I be waitin' in the kitchen for him to bring
back the things so's I can start his supper. (<i>with a laugh</i>
<i>and a roguish look at Rogers</i>) Dearie me, it ain't no use
dependin' on a man to remember nothin' when he's in love.</p>

<p>ROGERS--(<i>putting his arm about her waist and giving her a
squeeze--grinning</i>) How 'bout me? Ain't I in love and ain't I
as reliable as an old hoss?</p>

<p>HARRIET--Oh, you! You're the worst of 'em all.</p>

<p>ROGERS--You don't think so. (<i>He tries to kiss her.</i>)</p>

<p>HARRIET--Stop it. Ain't you got no manners? What'll Emmer
think?</p>

<p>ROGERS--Emmer can't throw stones. Her and Caleb is worser at
spoonin' than what we are. (<i>Harriet breaks away from him
laughingly and goes to Emma.</i>)</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>suddenly noticing the expression of misery on
Emma's face--astonished</i>) Why, Emmer Crosby, what's the
matter? You look as if you'd lost your last friend.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>trying to smile</i>) Nothing. It's nothing.</p>

<p>HARRIET--It is, too! Why, I do believe you've been crying!</p>

<p>EMMA--No, I ain't.</p>

<p>HARRIET--You have, too! (<i>putting her arms about Emma</i>)
Goodness, what's happened? You and Caleb ain't had a spat, have
you, with your weddin' only two days off?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with quick resentful resolution</i>) There ain't
going to be any wedding.</p>

<p>HARRIET--What!</p>

<p>ROGERS--(<i>pricking up his ears--inquisitively</i>) Huh?</p>

<p>EMMA--Not in two days nor no time.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>dumbfounded</i>) Why, Emmer Crosby! Whatever's
got into you? You and Caleb must have had an awful spat!</p>

<p>ROGERS--(<i>with a man-of-the-world attitude of cynicism</i>)
Don't take her so dead serious, Harriet. Emmer'll git over it
like you all does.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>angrily</i>) You shet up, Alf Rogers! (<i>Mrs.
Crosby enters bustlingly from the right. She is a large, fat,
florid woman of fifty. In spite of her two hundred and more
pounds she is surprisingly active, and the passive, lazy
expression of her round moon face is belied by her quick,
efficient movements. She exudes an atmosphere of motherly good
nature. She wears an apron on which</i> <i>she is drying her
hands as she enters. Jack follows her into the room. He has
changed to a dark suit, is ready for "up street."</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>smiling at Harriet and Rogers</i>) Afternoon,
Harriet--and Alf.</p>

<p>HARRIET--Afternoon, Ma.</p>

<p>ROGERS--Afternoon.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>grinning</i>) There she be, Ma. (<i>points to
Emma</i>) Don't she look like she'd scratch a feller's eyes out!
Phew! Look at her back curve! Meow? Sptt-sptt! Nice puss! (<i>He
gives a vivid imitation of a cat fight at this last. Then he and
Rogers roar with laughter and Harriet cannot restrain a giggle
and Mrs. Crosby smiles. Emma stares stonily before her as if she
didn't hear.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>good-naturedly</i>) Shet up your foolin',
Jack.</p>

<p>JACK--(<i>pretending to be hurt</i>) Nobody in this house kin
take a joke. (<i>He grins and beckons to Rogers.</i>) Come along,
Alf. You kin 'preciate a joke. Come on in here till I tell you.
(<i>The grinning Rogers follows him into the next room where they
can be heard talking and laughing during the following
scene.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>smiling, puts her arms around Emma</i>) Waal,
Emmer, what's this foolishness Jack's been tellin' about--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>resentfully</i>) It ain't foolishness, Ma. I've made
up my mind, I tell you that right here and now.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>after a quick glance at her
face--soothingly</i>) There, there! Let's set down and be
comfortable. Me, I don't relish roostin' on my feet. (<i>She
pushes Emma gently into a rocker--then points to a chair on the
other side of the table.</i>) Set down, Harriet.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>torn between curiosity and a sense of being one
too many</i>) Maybe I'd best go to home and leave you two
alone?</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Shucks! Ain't you like one o' the family--Caleb's
sister and livin' right next door ever since you was all children
playin' together. We ain't got no secrets from you. Set down.
(<i>Harriet does so with an uncertain glance at the frozen Emma.
Mrs. Crosby has efficiently bustled another rocker beside her
daughter's and sits down with a comfortable sigh.</i>) There.
(<i>She reaches over and takes one of her daughter's hands in
hers.</i>) And now, Emmer, what's all this fuss over? (<i>as Emma
makes no reply</i>) Jack says as you've sworn you was breakin'
with Caleb. Is that true?</p>

<p>EMMA--Yes.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Hmm. Caleb don't know this yet, does he?</p>

<p>EMMA--No. I asked Jack to tell him when he comes back.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Jack says he won't.</p>

<p>EMMA--Then I'll tell him myself. Maybe that's better, anyhow.
Caleb'll know what I'm driving at and see my
reason--(<i>bitterly</i>)--which nobody else seems to.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Hmm. You ain't tried me yet. (<i>after a
pause</i>) Jack was a dumb fool to tell you 'bout them goin's-on
at them islands they teched. Ain't no good repeatin' sech
things.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>surprised</i>) Did you know about it before
Jack--</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Mercy, yes. Your Pa heard it from Jim Benson fust
thing they landed here, and Pa told me that night.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>resentfully</i>) And you never told me!</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Mercy, no. 'Course I didn't. They's trouble
enough in the world without makin' more. If you was like most
folks I'd told it to you. Me, I thought it was a good joke on
Caleb.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with a shudder</i>) It ain't a joke to me.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--That's why I kept my mouth shet. I knowed you was
touchy and diff'rent from most.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>proudly</i>) Yes, I am diff'rent--and that's just
what I thought Caleb was, too--and he ain't.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>breaking in excitedly</i>) Is it that story about
Caleb and that heathen brown woman you're talking about? Is that
what you're mad at Caleb for, Emmer?</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>as Emma remains silent</i>) Yes, Harriet,
that's it.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>astonished</i>) Why, Emmer Crosby, how can you be
so silly? You don't s'pose Caleb took it serious, do you, and him
makin' them fire shots round her to scare her back to land and
get rid of her? Good gracious! (<i>a bit resentfully</i>) I hope
you ain't got it in your head my brother Caleb would sink so low
as to fall in love serious with one of them critters?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>harshly</i>) He might just as well.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>bridling</i>) How can you say sech a thing!
(<i>sarcastically</i>) I ain't heard that Caleb offered to marry
her, have you? Then you might have some cause--But d'you s'pose
he's ever give her another thought? Not Caleb! I know him
better'n that. He'd forgot all about the hull thing before they
was out o' sight of land, I'll bet, and if them fools hadn't
started this story going, he'd never remembered it again.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>nodding</i>) That's jest it. Harriet's right,
Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--Ma!</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Besides, you don't know they was nothin' wrong
happened. Nobody kin swear that for sartin. Ain't that so,
Harriet?</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>hesitating--then frankly</i>) I don't know. Caleb
ain't no plaster saint and I reckon he's as likely to sin that
way as any other man. He wasn't married then and I s'pose he
thought he was free to do as he'd a mind to 'til he was hitched
up. Goodness sakes, Emmer, all the men thinks that--and a lot of
'em after they're married, too.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Harriet's right, Emmer. If you've been wide awake
to all that's happened in this town since you was old enough to
know, you'd ought to realize what men be.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>scornfully</i>) Emma'd ought to have fallen in
love with a minister, not a sailor. As for me, I wouldn't give a
durn about a man that was too goody-goody to raise Cain once in a
while--before he married me, I mean. Why, look at Alf Rogers,
Emmer. I'm going to marry him some day, ain't I? But I know right
well all the foolin' he's done--and still is doing, I expect. I
ain't sayin' I like it but I do like him and I got to take him
the way he is, that's all. If you're looking for saints, you got
to die first and go to heaven. A girl'd never git married
hereabouts if she expected too much.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Harriet's right, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>resentfully</i>) Maybe she is, Ma, from her side. I
ain't claiming she's wrong. Her and me just looks at things
diff'rent, that's all. And she can't understand the way I feel
about Caleb.</p>

<p>HARRIET--Well, there's one thing certain, Emmer. You won't
find a man in a day's walk is any better'n Caleb--or as good.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>wearily</i>) I know that, Harriet.</p>

<p>HARRIET--Then it's all right. You'll make up with him, and I
s'pose I'm a fool to be takin' it so serious. (<i>as Emma shakes
her head</i>) Oh, yes, you will. You wouldn't want to get him all
broke up, would you? (<i>as Emma keeps silent--irritably</i>)
Story book notions, that's the trouble with you, Emmer. You're
gettin' to think you're better'n the rest of us.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>vehemently</i>) No, I don't! Can't you see--</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Thar, now! Don't you two git to fightin'--to make
things worse.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>repentantly, coming and putting her arms around
Emma and kissing her</i>) I'm sorry, Emmer. You know I wouldn't
fall out with you for nothing or nobody, don't you? Only it gits
me riled to think of how awful broke up Caleb'd be if--But you'll
make it all up with him when he comes, won't you? (<i>Emma stares
stubbornly before her. Before she has a chance to reply a roar of
laughter comes from the next room as Jack winds up his
tale.</i>)</p>

<p>ROGERS--(<i>from the next room</i>) Gosh, I wished I'd been
there! (<i>He follows Jack into the room. Both are grinning
broadly. Rogers says teasingly</i>) Reckon I'll take to whalin'
'stead o' fishin' after this. You won't mind, Harriet? From what
I hears o' them brown women, I'm missin' a hull lot by stayin' to
home.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>in a joking tone--with a meaning glance at
Emma</i>) Go on, then! There's plenty of fish in the sea. Anyhow,
I'd never git jealous of your foolin' with one o' them heathen
critters. They ain't worth notice from a Christian.</p>

<p>JACK--Oho, ain't they! They're purty as pictures, Benson says.
(<i>with a wink</i>) And mighty accommodatin' in their ways.
(<i>He and Rogers roar delightedly. Emma shudders with
revulsion.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>aware of her daughter's feeling--smilingly
but firmly</i>) Get out o' this, Jack. You, too, Alf. Go on up
street if you want to joke. You're in my way.</p>

<p>JACK--Aw right, Ma. Come on up street, Alf.</p>

<p>HARRIET--Wait. I'll go with you a step. I got to see if
Caleb's got back with them supper things. (<i>They all go to the
door in rear. Jack and Rogers pass out, talking and laughing.
Harriet turns in the doorway--sympathetically</i>) I'll give
Caleb a talking-to before he comes over. Then it'll be easy for
you to finish him. Treat him firm but gentle and you'll see he
won't never do it again in a hurry. After all, he wasn't married,
Emmer--and he's a man--and what can you expect? Good-by. (<i>She
goes.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>inaudibly</i>) Good-by.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>after a pause in which she rocks back and
forth studying her daughter's face--placidly</i>) Harriet's
right, Emmer. You give him a good talkin'-to and he won't do it
again.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>coldly</i>) I don't care whether he does or not. I
ain't going to marry him.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>uneasy--persuasively</i>) Mercy, you can't
act like that, Emmer. Here's the weddin' on'y two days off, and
everythin' fixed up with the minister, and your Pa and Jack has
bought new clothes speshul for it, and I got a new dress--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>turning to her mother--pleadingly</i>) You wouldn't
want me to keep my promise to Caleb if you knew I'd be unhappy,
would you, Ma?</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>hesitatingly</i>) N-no, Emmer. (<i>then
decisively</i>) 'Course I wouldn't. It's because I know he'll
make you happy. (<i>as Emma shakes her head</i>) Pshaw, Emmer,
you can't tell me you've got over all likin' for him jest 'count
o' this one foolishness o' hisn.</p>

<p>EMMA--I don't love him--what he is now. I loved--what I
thought he was.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>more and more uneasy</i>) That's all your
queer notions, and I don't know where you gits them from. Caleb
ain't changed, neither have you. Why, Emmer, it'd be jest like
goin' agen an act of Nature for you not to marry him. Ever since
you was children you been livin' side by side, goin' round
together, and neither you nor him ever did seem to care for no
one else. Shucks, Emmer, you'll git me to lose patience with you
if you act that stubborn. You'd ought to remember all he's been
to you and forget this one little wrong he's done.</p>

<p>EMMA--I can't, Ma. It makes him another person--not Caleb, but
someone just like all the others.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--Waal, is the others so bad? Men is men the world
over, I reckon.</p>

<p>EMMA--No, they ain't bad. I ain't saying that. Don't I like
'em all? If it was one of the rest--like Jim Benson or Jack,
even--had done this I'd thought it was a joke, too. I ain't
strict in judging 'em and you know it. But--can't you see,
Ma?--Caleb always seemed diff'rent--and I thought he was.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>somewhat impatiently</i>) Waal, if he ain't,
he's a good man jest the same, as good as any sensible girl'd
want to marry.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>slowly</i>) I don't want to marry nobody no more.
I'll stay single.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>tauntingly</i>) An old maid! (<i>then
resentfully</i>) Emmer, d'you s'pose if I'd had your high-fangled
notions o' what men ought to be when I was your age, d'you s'pose
you'd ever be settin' there now?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>slowly</i>) No. I know from what I can guess from
his own stories Pa never was no saint.</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>in a tone of finality as if this settled the
matter</i>) There, now! And ain't he been as good a husband to me
as ever lived, and a good father to you and Jack? You'll find out
Caleb'll turn out the same. You think it over. (<i>She gets
up--bustlingly</i>) And now I got to git back in the kitchen.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>wringing her hands--desperately</i>) Oh, Ma, why
can't you see what I feel? Of course, Pa's good--as good as good
can be--</p>

<p>CAPTAIN CROSBY--(<i>from outside the door which he has
approached without their noticing him--in a jovial bellow</i>)
What's that 'bout Pa bein' good? (<i>He comes in laughing. He is
a squat, bow-legged, powerful man, almost as broad as he is
long--sixty years old but still in the prime of health and
strength, with a great, red, weather-beaten face seamed by sun
wrinkles. His sandy hair is thick and disheveled. He is dressed
in an old baggy suit much the worse for wear--striped cotton
shirt open at the neck. He pats Emma on the back with a playful
touch that almost jars her off her feet.</i>) Thunderin' Moses,
that's the fust time ever I heerd good o' myself by listenin'!
Most times it's: "Crosby? D'you mean that drunken,
good-for-nothin', mangy old cuss?" That's what I hears usual.
Thank ye, Emmer. (<i>turning to his wife</i>) What ye got to say
now, Ma? Here's Emmer tellin' you the truth after you
hair-pullin' me all these years 'cause you thought it wa'n't. I
always told ye I was good, ain't I--good as hell I be! (<i>He
shakes with laughter and kisses his wife a resounding
smack.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>teasing lovingly</i>) Emmer don't know you
like I do.</p>

<p>CROSBY--(<i>turning back to Emma again</i>) Look-a-here,
Emmer, I jest seen Jack. He told me some fool story 'bout you
fallin' out with Caleb. Reckon he was joshin', wa'n't he?</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>quickly</i>) Oh, that's all settled, John.
Don't you go stirrin' it up again. (<i>Emma seems about to speak
but stops helplessly after one glance at her father.</i>)</p>

<p>CROSBY--An' all 'count o' that joke they're tellin' 'bout him
and that brown female critter, Jack says. Hell, Emmer, you ain't
a real Crosby if you takes a joke like that serious. Thunderin'
Moses, what the hell d'you want Caleb to be--a durned, he-virgin,
sky-pilot? Caleb's a man wo'th ten o' most and, spite o' his
bein' on'y a boy yit, he's the smartest skipper out o' this port
and you'd ought to be proud you'd got him. And as for them
islands, all whalin' men knows 'em. I've teched thar for water
more'n once myself, and I know them brown females like a book.
And I tells you, after a year or more aboard ship, a man'd have
to be a goll-durned geldin' if he don't--</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>glancing uneasily at Emma</i>) Ssshh! You
come out in the kitchen with me, Pa, and leave Emmer be.</p>

<p>CROSBY--God A'mighty, Ma, I ain't sayin' nothin' agen Emmer,
be I? I knows Emmer ain't that crazy. If she ever got religion
that bad, I'd ship her off as female missionary to the damned
yellow Chinks. (<i>He laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. CROSBY--(<i>taking his arm</i>) You come with me. I want
to talk with you 'bout somethin'.</p>

<p>CROSBY--(<i>going</i>) Aye-aye, skipper! You're boss aboard
here. (<i>He goes out right with her, laughing. Emma stands for a
while, staring stonily before her. She sighs hopelessly, clasping
and unclasping her hands, looking around the room as if she
longed to escape from it. Finally she sits down helplessly and
remains fixed in a strained attitude, her face betraying the
conflict that is tormenting her. Slow steps sound from the path
in front of the house. Emma recognizes them and her face freezes
into an expression of obstinate intolerance.</i>)</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>appears outside the screen door. He looks in,
coughs--then asks uncertainly</i>) It's me, Emmer. Kin I come
in?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>coldly</i>) Yes.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>comes in and walks down beside her chair. His face
is set emotionlessly but his eyes cannot conceal a worried
bewilderment, a look of uncomprehending hurt. He stands
uncomfortably, fumbling with his hat, waiting for her to speak or
look up. As she does neither, he finally blurts out</i>) Kin I
set a spell?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>in the same cold tone</i>) Yes. (<i>He lowers
himself carefully to a wooden posture on the edge of a rocker
near hers.</i>)</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>after a pause</i>) I seen Jim Benson. I give him
hell. He won't tell no more tales, I reckon. (<i>another
pause</i>) I stopped to home on the way back from the store. I
seen Harriet. She says Jack'd told you that story they're all
tellin' as a joke on me. (<i>clenching his fists--angrily</i>)
Jack's a durn fool. He needs a good lickin' from someone.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>resentfully</i>) Don't try to put the blame on Jack.
He only told me the truth, didn't he? (<i>Her voice shows that
she hopes against hope for a denial.</i>)</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>after a long pause--regretfully</i>) Waal, I guess
what he told is true enough.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>wounded</i>) Oh!</p>

<p>CALEB--But that ain't no good reason for tellin' it. Them sort
o' things ought to be kept among men. (<i>after a
pause--gropingly</i>) I didn't want nothin' like that to happen,
Emmer. I didn't mean it to. I was thinkin' o' how you might
feel--even down there. That's why I stayed aboard all the time
when the boys was ashore. I wouldn't have b'lieved it could
happen--not to me. (<i>a pause</i>) I wish you could see them
Islands, Emmer, and be there for a time. Then you might see--It's
hard 's hell to explain, and you havin' never seen 'em.
Everything is diff'rent down there--the weather--and the trees
and water. You git lookin' at it all, and you git to feel
diff'rent from what you do to home here. It's purty hereabouts
sometimes--like now, in spring--but it's purty there all the
time--and down there you notice it and you git
feelin'--diff'rent. And them native women--they're diff'rent. A
man don't think of 'em as women--like you. But they're putty--in
their fashion--and at night they sings--and it's all diff'rent
like something you'd see in a painted picture. (<i>a pause</i>)
That night when she swum out and got aboard when I was alone, she
caught me by s'prise. I wasn't expectin' nothin' o' that sort. I
tried to make her git back to land at fust--but she wouldn't go.
She couldn't understand enough English for me to tell her how I
felt--and I reckon she wouldn't have seed my p'int anyhow, her
bein' a native. (<i>a pause</i>) And then I was afeerd she'd
catch cold goin' round all naked and wet in the moonlight--though
it was warm--and I wanted to wrap a blanket round her. (<i>He
stops as if he had finished.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>after a long, tense pause--dully</i>) Then you own
up--there really was something happened?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>after a pause</i>) I was sorry for it, after. I
locked myself in the cabin and left her to sleep out on deck.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>after a pause--fixedly</i>) I ain't going to marry
you, Caleb.</p>

<p>CALEB--Harriet said you'd said that; but I didn't b'lieve
you'd let a slip like that make--such a diff'rence.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with finality</i>) Then you can believe it now,
Caleb.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>after a pause</i>) You got queer, strict notions,
Emmer. A man'll never live up to 'em--with never one slip. But
you got to act accordin' to your lights, I expect. It sort o'
busts everythin' to bits for me--(<i>His voice betrays his
anguish for a second but he instantly regains his iron
control.</i>) But o' course, if you ain't willin' to take me the
way I be, there's nothin' to do. And whatever you think is best,
suits me.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>after a pause--gropingly</i>) I wish I could explain
my side of it--so's you'd understand. I ain't got any hard
feelings against you, Caleb--not now. It ain't plain
jealousy--what I feel. It ain't even that I think you've done
nothing terrible wrong. I think I can understand--how it
happened--and make allowances. I know that most any man would do
the same, and I guess all of 'em I ever met has done it.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with a glimmer of eager hope</i>) Then--you'll
forgive it, Emmer?</p>

<p>EMMA--Yes, I forgive it. But don't think that my forgiving is
going to make any diff'rence--'cause I ain't going to marry you,
Caleb. That's final. (<i>after a pause--intensely</i>) Oh, I wish
I could make you see--my reason. You don't. You never will, I
expect. What you done is just what any other man would have
done--and being like them is exactly what'll keep you from ever
seeing my meaning. (<i>after a pause--in a last effort to make
him understand</i>) Maybe it's my fault more'n your'n. It's like
this, Caleb. Ever since we was little I guess I've always had the
idea that you was--diff'rent. And when we growed up and got
engaged I thought that more and more. And you was diff'rent, too!
And that was why I loved you. And now you've proved you ain't.
And so how can I love you any more? I don't, Caleb, and that's
all there is to it. You've busted something way down inside
me--and I can't love you no more.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>gloomily</i>) I've warned you often, ain't I, you
was settin' me up where I'd no business to be. I'm human like the
rest and always was. I ain't diff'rent. (<i>after a
pause--uncertainly</i>) I reckon there ain't no use sayin'
nothin' more. I'll go to home. (<i>He starts to rise.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--Wait. I don't want you to go out of here with no hard
feelings. You 'n' me, Caleb, we've been too close all our lives
to ever get to be enemies. I like you, Caleb, same's I always
did. I want us to stay friends. I want you to be like one of the
family same's you've always been. There's no reason you can't. I
don't blame you--as a man--for what I wouldn't hold against any
other man. If I find I can't love you--that way--no more or be
your wife, it's just that I've decided--things being what they be
and me being what I am--I won't marry no man. I'll stay single.
(<i>forcing a smile</i>) I guess there's worse things than being
an old maid.</p>

<p>CALEB--I can't picture you that, Emmer. It's natural in some
but it ain't in you. (<i>then with a renewal of hope</i>) And o'
course I want to stay friends with you, Emmer. There's no hard
feelin's on my side. You got a right to your own way--even
if--(<i>hopefully</i>) And maybe if I show you what I done wasn't
natural to me--by never doin' it again--maybe the time'll come
when you'll be willin' to forget--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>shaking her head--slowly</i>) It ain't a question of
time, Caleb. It's a question of something being dead. And when a
thing's died, time can't make no diff'rence.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>sturdily</i>) You don't know that for sure, Emmer.
You're human, too, and as liable to make mistakes as any other.
Maybe you on'y think it's dead, and when I come back from the
next vige and you've had two years to think it over, you'll see
diff'rent and know I ain't as bad as I seem to ye now.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>helplessly</i>) But you don't seem bad, Caleb. And
two years can't make no change in me--that way.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>feeling himself somehow more and more heartened by
hope</i>) I ain't givin' up hope, Emmer, and you can't make me.
Not by a hell of a sight. (<i>with emphasis</i>) I ain't never
goin' to marry no woman but you, Emmer. You can trust my word for
that. And I'll wait for ye to change your mind, I don't give a
durn how long it'll take--till I'm sixty years old--thirty years
if it's needful! (<i>He rises to his feet as he is speaking this
last.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with a mournful smile</i>) You might just as well
say for life, Caleb. In thirty years we'll both be dead and gone,
probably. And I don't want you to think it's needful for you to
stay single 'cause I--</p>

<p>CALEB--I ain't goin' to stay single. I'm goin' to wait for
you. And some day when you realize men was never cut out for
angels you'll--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>helplessly</i>) Me 'n' you'll never understand each
other, Caleb, so long as we live. (<i>getting up and holding out
her hand</i>) Good-by, Caleb. I'm going up and lie down for a
spell.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>made hopeless again by her tone--clasps her hand
mechanically--dully</i>) Good-by, Emmer. (<i>He goes to the door
in the rear, opens it, then hesitates and looks back at her as
she goes out the door on the right without turning around.
Suddenly he blurts out despairingly</i>) You'll remember what I
told ye 'bout waitin', Emmer? (<i>She is gone, makes no reply.
His face sets in its concealment mask of emotionlessness and he
turns slowly and goes out the door as</i></p>

<h1><a name="a02">ACT TWO</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Thirty years after--the scene is the same but not
the same. The room has a grotesque aspect of old age turned
flighty and masquerading as the most empty-headed youth. There is
an obstreperous newness about everything. Orange curtains are at
the windows. The carpet has given way to a varnished hardwood
floor, its glassy surface set off by three small, garish-colored
rugs, placed with precision in front of the two doors and under
the table. The wall paper is now a cream color sprayed with pink
flowers. Seascapes, of the painted-to-order quality, four in
number, in gilded frames, are hung on the walls at mathematically
spaced intervals. The plush-covered chairs are gone, replaced by
a set of varnished oak. The horsehair sofa has been relegated to
the attic. A cane-bottomed affair with fancy cushions serves in
its stead. A Victrola is where the old mahogany chest had been. A
brand new piano shines resplendently in the far right corner by
the door, and a bookcase with glass doors that pull up and slide
in flanks the fireplace. This bookcase is full of
installment-plan sets of uncut volumes. The table at center is of
varnished oak. On it are piles of fashion magazines and an
electric reading lamp. Only the old Bible, which still preserves
its place of honor on the table, and the marble clock on the
mantel, have survived the renovation and serve to emphasize it
all the more by contrast.</i></p>

<p><i>It is late afternoon of a day in the early spring of the
year 1920.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, Emma and Benny Rogers are discovered.
She is seated in a rocker by the table. He is standing by the
Victrola on which a jazz band record is playing. He whistles,
goes through the motions of dancing to the music. He is a young
fellow of twenty-three, a replica of his father in Act One, but
coarser, more hardened and cocksure. He is dressed in the khaki
uniform of a private in the United States Army. The thirty years
have transformed Emma into a withered, scrawny woman. But there
is something revoltingly incongruous about her, a pitiable sham,
a too-apparent effort to cheat the years by appearances. The
white dress she wears is too frilly, too youthful for her; so are
the high-heeled pumps and clocked silk stockings. There is an
absurd suggestion of rouge on her tight cheeks and thin lips, of
penciled make-up about her eyes. The black of her hair is
brazenly untruthful. Above all there is shown in her simpering,
self-consciously</i> <i>coquettish manner that laughable--and at
the same time irritating and disgusting--mockery of undignified
age snatching greedily at the empty simulacra of youth. She
resembles some pass&eacute; stock actress of fifty made up for a
heroine of twenty.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>as the record stops--switches off the machine</i>)
Oh, baby! Some jazz, I'll tell the world!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>smiling lovingly at his back</i>) I'm glad you like
it. It's one of them you picked out on the list.</p>

<p>BENNY--Oh, I'm a swell little picker, aw right. (<i>turning to
her</i>) Say, you're a regular feller--gettin' them records for
me.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>coquettishly</i>) Well, if that ain't just like a
man! Who told you I got them just for you?</p>

<p>BENNY--Well, didn't you?</p>

<p>EMMA--No indeedy! I only took your advice on what to get. I
knew you'd know, being growed to a man of the world now since you
was overseas. But I got 'em because I like them jazz tunes
myself. They put life and ginger in an old lady like me--not like
them slow, old-timey tunes.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>bends over chair--kiddingly</i>) You ain't old.
That's all bunk.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>flattered</i>) Now, now, Benny!</p>

<p>BENNY--You ain't. You're a regular, up-to-date sport--the only
live one in this dead dump. (<i>with a grin</i>) And if you fall
for that jazz stuff, all you got to do now is learn to dance to
it.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>giggling</i>) I will--if you'll teach me.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>struggling with a guffaw</i>) Oh, oui! Sure I will!
We'll have a circus, me an' you. Say, you're sure one of the
girls aw right, Aunt Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--Oh, you needn't think we're <i>all</i> so behind the
times to home here just because you've been to France and all
over.</p>

<p>BENNY--<i>You</i> ain't, I'll say, Aunt Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--And how often have I got to tell you not to call me Aunt
Emmer?</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a grin</i>) Oh, oui! My foot slipped. 'Scuse
me, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>delighted by his coarse familiarity</i>) That's
better. Why, you know well enough I ain't your aunt anyway.</p>

<p>BENNY--I got to get used to the plain Emmer. They taught me to
call you "aunt" when I was a kid. (<i>Emma looks displeased at
this remark and Benny hastens to add cajolingly</i>) And you
almost was my aunt-in-law one time from what I've heard.
(<i>winks at her cunningly</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>flustered</i>) That was ages ago. (<i>catching
herself quickly</i>) Not so awful long really, but it's all so
dead and gone it seems a long while.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>unthinkingly</i>) It was before I was born, wasn't
it? (<i>Seeing her expression he hurries on.</i>) Well, that
ain't so darned long. Say, here's something I never could make
out--how did you ever come to fall for Uncle Caleb?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>bridling quickly</i>) I never did. That's all talk,
Benny. We was good friends and still are. I was young and foolish
and got engaged to him--and then discovered I didn't like him
that way. That's all there ever was to it.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>resentfully</i>) I can't figure how anybody'd ever
like him anyway. He's a darn stingy, ugly old cuss, if you want
my dope on him. I can't see him at all. I've hated him ever since
Pa died and Ma and me had to go live next door with him.</p>

<p>EMMA--You oughtn't to say that. He's kind at bottom, spite of
his rough ways, and he's brought you up.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>grumpily</i>) Dragged me up, you mean. (<i>with a
calculating look at her out of the corners of his eyes</i>) He's
a tightwad and I hate folks that're tight with their coin. Spend
and be a good sport, that's my motto. (<i>flattering</i>) He'd
ought to be more like you that way, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>pleased--condescendingly</i>) Your Uncle Caleb's an
old man, remember. He's sot in his ways and believes in being
strict with you--too strict, I've told him.</p>

<p>BENNY--He's got piles of money hoarded in the bank but he's
too mean even to retire from whalin' himself--goes right on
makin' vige after vige to grab more and never spends a nickel
less'n he has to. It was always like pryin' open a safe for me to
separate him from a cent. (<i>with extreme disgust</i>) Aw, he's
a piker. I hate him and I always did!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>looking toward the door apprehensively</i>)
Ssshh!</p>

<p>BENNY--What you scared of? He don't get in from New Bedford
till the night train and even if he's got to the house by this
he'll be busy as a bird dog for an hour getting himself dolled up
to pay you a call.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>perfunctorily</i>) I hope he's had a good vige and
is in good health.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>roughly</i>) You needn't worry. He's too mean ever
to get real sick. Gosh, I wish Pa'd lived--or Uncle Jack. They
wasn't like him. I was only a kid when they got drowned, but I
remember enough about 'em to know they was good sports. Wasn't
they?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>rather primly</i>) They was too sporty for their own
good.</p>

<p>BENNY--Don't you hand me that. That don't sound like you.
You're a sport yourself. (<i>after a pause</i>) Say, it's nutty
when you come to think of it--Uncle Caleb livin' next door all
these years and comin' to call all the time when he ain't at
sea.</p>

<p>EMMA--What's funny about that? We've always been good
friends.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a grin</i>) It's just as if the old guy was
still mashin' you. And I'll bet anything he's as stuck on you as
he ever was--the old fool!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with a coquettish titter</i>) Land sakes, Benny, a
body'd think you were actually jealous of your uncle the way you
go on.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a mocking laugh</i>) Jealous! Oh, oui! Sure I
am! Kin you blame me? (<i>then seriously, with a calculating look
at her</i>) No, all kiddin' aside, I know he'll run me down first
second he sees you. Ma'll tell him all her tales, and he'll be
sore at me right off. He's always hated me anyway. He was glad
when I enlisted, 'cause that got him rid of me. All he was hopin'
was that some German'd get me for keeps. Then when I come back he
wouldn't do nothin' for me so I enlisted again.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>chiding--playfully</i>) Now, Benny! Didn't you tell
me you enlisted again 'cause you were sick o' this small place
and wanted to be out where there was more fun?</p>

<p>BENNY--Well, o' course it was that, too. But I could have a
swell time even in this dump if he'd loosen up and give me some
kale. (<i>again with the calculating look at her</i>) Why, look
here, right now there's a buddy of mine wants me to meet him in
Boston and he'll show me a good time, and if I had a hundred
dollars--</p>

<p>EMMA--A hundred dollars! That's an awful pile to spend,
Benny.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>disgustedly</i>) Now you're talkin' tight like
him.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>hastily</i>) Oh, no, Benny. You know better'n that.
What was you sayin'--if you had a hundred dollars--?</p>

<p>BENNY--That ain't such a much these days with everything gone
up so. If I went to Boston I'd have to get dolled up and
everything. And this buddy of mine is a sport and a spender. Easy
come, easy go is his motto. His folks ain't tight-wads like mine.
And I couldn't show myself up as a cheap skate by travelin'
'round with him without a nickel in my jeans and just spongin' on
him. (<i>with the calculating glance to see what effect his words
are having--pretending to dismiss the subject</i>) But what's the
good of talkin'? I got a swell chance tellin' that to Uncle
Caleb. He'd give me one look and then put a double padlock on his
roll. But it ain't fair just the same. Here I'm sweatin' blood in
the army after riskin' my life in France and when I get a leave
to home, everyone treats me like a wet dog.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>softly</i>) Do you mean me, too, Benny?</p>

<p>BENNY--No, not you. You're diff'rent from the rest. You're
regular--and you ain't any of my real folks, either, and ain't
got any reason.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>coquettishly</i>) Oh, yes, I have a reason. I like
you very, very much, Benny--better than anyone in the
town--especially since you've been to home these last few times
and come to call so often and I feel I've growed to know you.
When you first came back from France I never would have
recognized you as Harriet's Benny, you was so big and strong and
handsome.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>uncomfortably</i>) Aw, you're kiddin'. But you can
tell how good I think you are from me bein' over here so much--so
you know I ain't lyin'. (<i>made more and more uncomfortable by
the ardent looks Emma is casting at him</i>) Well, guess I'll be
movin' along.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>pleadingly</i>) Oh, you mustn't go yet! Just when
we're gettin' so friendly!</p>

<p>BENNY--Uncle Caleb'll be over soon and I don't want him to
catch me here--nor nowhere else till he gets calmed down after
hearin' Ma's kicks about me. So I guess I better beat it up
street.</p>

<p>EMMA--He won't come for a long time yet. I know when to expect
him. (<i>pleading ardently and kittenishly</i>) Do set down a
spell, Benny! Land sakes, I hardly get a sight of you before you
want to run away again. I'll begin to think you're only
pretending to like me.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>seeing his calculations demand it</i>) Aw
right--jest for a second. (<i>He looks about him, seeking a
neutral subject for conversation.</i>) Gee, you've had this old
place fixed up swell since I was to home last.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>coquettishly</i>) Guess who I had it all done for,
mostly?</p>

<p>BENNY--For yourself, of course.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>shaking her head roguishly</i>) No, not for me, not
for me! Not that I don't like it but I'd never have gone to the
trouble and expense for myself. (<i>with a sigh</i>) I s'pose
poor Ma and Pa turned over in their graves when I ordered it
done.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a sly grin</i>) Who d'you have it done for,
then?</p>

<p>EMMA--For you! Yes, for you, Benny--so's you'd have a nice,
up-to-date place to come to when you was on vacation from the
horrid old army.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>embarrassed</i>) Well, it's great aw right. And it
sure looks swell--nothing cheap about it.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>delighted</i>) As long as you like it, I'm
satisfied. (<i>then suddenly, wagging an admonishing finger at
him and hiding beneath a joking manner an undercurrent of
uneasiness</i>) I was forgetting I got a bone to pick with you,
young man! I heard them sayin' to the store that you'd been up
callin' on that Tilly Small evenin' before last.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a lady-killer's carelessness</i>) Aw, I was
passin' by and she called me in, that's all.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>frowning</i>) They said you had the piano goin' and
was singing and no end of high jinks.</p>

<p>BENNY--Aw, these small town boobs think you're raising hell if
you're up after eleven.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>excitedly</i>) I ain't blamin' you. But her--she
ought to have better sense--at her age, too, when she's old
enough to be your mother.</p>

<p>BENNY--Aw, say, she ain't half as old--(<i>catching
himself</i>) Oh, she's an old fool, you're right there,
Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>severely</i>) And I hope you know the kind of woman
she is and has been since she was a girl.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a wink</i>) I wasn't born yesterday. I got her
number long ago. I ain't in my cradle, get me! I'm in the army!
Oui! (<i>chuckles</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>fidgeting nervously</i>) What'd you--what'd you do
when you was there?</p>

<p>BENNY--Why, nothin'. I told her to cut the rough work and
behave--and a nice time was had by all. (<i>He grins
provokingly.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>springs to her feet nervously</i>) I don't know what
to think--when you act so queer about it.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>carelessly</i>) Well, don't think nothing
wrong--'cause there wasn't. Bill Tinker was with me and we was
both wishin' we had a drink. And Bill says, "Let's go see Tilly
Small. She always has some buried and if we hand her a line of
talk maybe she'll drag out the old bottle." So we did--and she
did. We kidded her for a couple of drinks. (<i>He
snickers.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>standing in front of him--fidgeting</i>) I want you
to promise you won't go to see her no more. If you--if you want
liquor now and again maybe I--maybe I can fix it so's I can get
some to keep here for you.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>eagerly</i>) Say, that'd be great! Will you?
(<i>She nods. He goes on carelessly.</i>) And sure I'll promise
not to see Tilly no more. Gosh, what do you think I care about
her? Or about any dame in this town, for that matter--'ceptin'
you. These small town skirts don't hand me nothin'. (<i>with a
grin</i>) You forgot I was in France--and after the dames over
there these birds here look some punk.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>sits down--wetting her lips</i>) And what--what are
those French critters like?</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a wink</i>) Oh, boy! They're some pippins! It
ain't so much that they're better lookin' as that they've got a
way with 'em--lots of ways. (<i>He laughs with a lascivious
smirk.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>unconsciously hitches her chair nearer his. The
turn</i> <i>the conversation has taken seems to have aroused a
hectic, morbid intensity in her. She continually wets her lips
and pushes back her hair from her flushed face as if it were
stifling her.</i>) What do you mean, Benny? What kind of ways
have they got--them French girls?</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>smirking mysteriously</i>) Oh, ways of dressin' and
doin' their hair--and lots of ways.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>eagerly</i>) Tell me! Tell me all about 'em. You
needn't be scared--to talk open with me. I ain't as strict as I
seem--about hearin' things. Tell me! I've heard French girls was
awful wicked.</p>

<p>BENNY--I don't know about wicked, but they're darned good
sports. They'd do anything a guy'd ask 'em. Oui, tooty sweet!
(<i>laughs foolishly</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--And what--what'd you ask 'em, for instance?</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a wink</i>) Curiosity killed a cat! Ask me no
questions and I'll tell you no lies.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with queer, stupid insistence</i>) But won't you
tell me? Go on!</p>

<p>BENNY--Can't be did, Aunt Emmer, can't be did! (<i>with a
silly laugh</i>) You're too young. No, all I'll say is, that to
the boys who've knocked around over there the girls in town here
are just rank amatoors. They don't know how to love and that's a
fact. (<i>He gets to his feet.</i>) And as for an old bum like
Tilly--not me! Well, I guess I'll hike along--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>getting up and putting a hand on his
arm--feverishly</i>) No, don't go. Not yet--not yet. No, don't
go.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>stepping away with an expression of repulsion</i>)
Why not? What's the matter with you, Aunt Emmer? You look 's if
you was gettin' sick. (<i>Before she can reply, Harriet's voice
is heard calling.</i>)</p>

<p>HARRIET--Benny! Benny! (<i>This acts like a pail of cold water
on Emma who moves away from Benny quickly.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--That's Harriet. It's your Ma calling, Benny.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>impatiently</i>) I know. That means Uncle Caleb has
come and she's told him her stories and it's up to me to go catch
hell. (<i>stopping Emma as she goes toward the door as if to
answer Harriet's hail</i>) Don't answer, Aunt Emmer. Let her come
over here to look. I want to speak to her and find out how I
stand before he sees me.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>doubtfully</i>) I don't know as she'll come. She's
been actin' funny to me lately, Harriet has, and she ain't put
her foot in my door the last month.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>as his mother's voice is heard much nearer,
calling</i> "Benny!") There! Sure she's comin'.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>flustered</i>) Land sakes, I can't let her see me
this way. I got to run upstairs and tidy myself a little. (<i>She
starts for the door at right.</i>)</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>flatteringly</i>) Aw, you look swell. Them new duds
you got looks great.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>turning in the doorway--coquettishly</i>) Oh, them
French girls ain't the only ones knows how to fix up. (<i>She
flounces out. Benny stands looking after her with a derisive grin
of contempt. There is a sharp knock on the door in the rear.
Benny goes to open it, his expression turning surly and sullen.
Harriet enters. She wears an apron over her old-fashioned black
dress with a brooch at the neck. Her hair is gray, her face thin,
lined, and careworn, with a fretful, continuously irritated
expression. Her shoulders stoop, and her figure is flabby and
ugly. She stares at her son with resentful annoyance.</i>)</p>

<p>HARRIET--Ain't you got sense enough, you big lump, to answer
me when I call, and not have me shouting my lungs out?</p>

<p>BENNY--I never heard you callin'.</p>

<p>HARRIET--You're lyin' and you know it. (<i>then severely</i>)
Your uncle's to home. He's waitin' to talk to you.</p>

<p>BENNY--Let him wait. (<i>in a snarling tone</i>) I s'pose
you've been givin' him an earful of lies about me?</p>

<p>HARRIET--I told him the truth, if that's what you mean. How
you stole the money out of the bureau drawer--</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>alarmed but pretending scorn</i>) Aw, you don't
know it was me. You don't know nothin' about it.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>ignoring this</i>) And about your disgracin' him
and me with your drunken carryin's-on with that harlot, Tilly
Small, night after night.</p>

<p>BENNY--Aw, wha'd you know about that?</p>

<p>HARRIET--And last but not least, the sneakin' way you're
makin' a silly fool out of poor Emmer Crosby.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a grin</i>) You don't notice her kickin' about
it, do you? (<i>brusquely</i>) Why don't you mind your own
business, Ma?</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>violently</i>) It's a shame, that's what it is!
That I should live to see the day when a son of mine'd descend so
low he'd tease an old woman to get money out of her, and her
alone in the world. Oh, you're low, you're low all through like
your Pa was--and since you been in the army you got bold so you
ain't even ashamed of your dirtiness no more!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>in a snarling whisper</i>) That's right! Blame it
all on me. I s'pose she ain't got nothin' to do with it. (<i>with
a wink</i>) You oughter see her perform sometimes. You'd get wise
to something then.</p>

<p>HARRIET--Shut up! You've got the same filthy mind your Pa had.
As for Emmer, I don't hold her responsible. She's been gettin'
flighty the past two years. She couldn't help it, livin' alone
the way she does, shut up in this house all her life. You ought
to be 'shamed to take advantage of her condition--but shame ain't
in you.</p>

<p>BENNY--Aw, give us a rest!</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>angrily</i>) Your Uncle Caleb'll give you a rest
when he sees you! Him and me's agreed not to give you another
single penny if you was to get down on your knees for it. So
there! You can git along on your army pay from this out.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>worried by the finality in her
tone--placatingly</i>) Aw, say, Ma, what's eatin' you? What've I
done that's so bad? Gosh, you oughta know some of the gang I know
in the army. You'd think I was a saint if you did. (<i>trying a
confidential tone</i>) Honest, Ma, this here thing with Aunt
Emmer ain't my fault. How can I help it if she goes bugs in her
old age and gets nutty about me? (<i>with a sly grin--in a
whisper</i>) Gee, Ma, you oughta see her today. She's a scream,
honest! She's upstairs now gettin' calmed down. She was gettin'
crazy when your callin' stopped her. Wait till she comes down and
you git a look! She'll put your eye out--all dolled up like a kid
of sixteen and enough paint on her mush for a Buffalo Bill
Indian--</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>staring at him with stern condemnation</i>)
You're a worthless loafer, Benny Rogers, same as your Pa was.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>frustrated and furious</i>) Aw, g'wan with that
bunk! (<i>He turns away from her.</i>)</p>

<p>HARRIET--And I'm goin' to tell Emma about you and try to put
some sense back into her head.</p>

<p>BENNY--Go ahead. You'll get fat runnin' me down to her!</p>

<p>HARRIET--And if my word don't have no influence, I'll tell
your Uncle Caleb everything, and get him to talk to her. She'll
mind him.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>defiantly</i>) You just try it, that's all!</p>

<p>HARRIET--I've been scared to do more'n hint about it to him.
I'm hopin' any day Emma'll come out of this foolishness, and
he'll never know.</p>

<p>BENNY--Aw!</p>

<p>HARRIET--If shame was in you, you'd remember your Uncle
Caleb's been in love with Emma all his life and waited for her
year after year hopin' in the end she'd change her mind and marry
him. And she will, too, I believe, if she comes out of this fit
in her sane mind--which she won't if you keep fussin' with
her.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with revengeful triumph</i>) She'll never marry the
old cuss--I'll fix that!</p>

<p>HARRIET--Now you're showin' yourself up for what you are! And
I kin see it's come to the p'int where I got to tell your Uncle
Caleb everythin' no matter how it breaks him up. I got to do it
for Emmer's sake as well as his'n. We got to get her cured of
your bad influence once and for all. It's the only hope for the
two of 'em.</p>

<p>BENNY--You just try it!</p>

<p>HARRIET--And as for you, you get back to the army where you
b'long! And don't never expect another cent from me or Caleb
'cause you won't get it! And don't never come to see us again
till you've got rid of the meanness and filth that's the Rogers
part of you and found the honesty and decency that's the Williams
part--if you got any of me in you at all, which I begin to doubt.
(<i>goes to the door in rear</i>) And now I'm goin' back to
Caleb--and you better not let him find you here when he comes
less'n you want a good hidin' for once in your life. (<i>She goes
out.</i>)</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>stammering between fear and rage--shouting after
her</i>) G'wan! Tell him! What the hell do I care? I'll fix him!
I'll spill the beans for both of you, if you try to gum me!
(<i>He stands in the middle of the room hesitating whether to run
away</i> <i>or stay concentrating his thoughts on finding some
way to make good his bluff. Suddenly his face lights up with a
cruel grin and he mutters to himself with savage
satisfaction</i>) By God, that's it! I'll bet I kin work it, too!
By God, that'll fix 'em! (<i>He chuckles and goes quickly to the
door on right and calls up to the floor above</i>) Emmer!
Emmer!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>her voice faintly heard answering</i>) Yes, Benny,
I'm coming.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>He calls quickly</i>) Come down! Come down quick!
(<i>He comes back to the center of the room where he stands
waiting, planning his course of action.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>appears in the doorway. Her face is profusely
powdered--with nervous excitement</i>) Benny! What's the matter?
You sounded so--why where's your Ma?</p>

<p>BENNY--Gone. Gone back to home.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>offendedly</i>) Without waiting to see me? Why, I
only sat down for a minute to give you a chance to talk to her. I
was coming right down. Didn't she want to see me? Whatever's got
into Harriet lately?</p>

<p>BENNY--She's mad as thunder at you 'cause I come over here so
much 'stead of stayin' to home with her.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>pleased</i>) Oh, is that why? Well, if she ain't
peculiar! (<i>She sits in a rocker by the table.</i>)</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with a great pretense of grief, taking one of her
hands in his</i>) Say, Emmer--what I called you down for was--I
want to say good-by and thank you for all you've done--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>frightenedly</i>) Good-by? How you say that!
What--?</p>

<p>BENNY--Good-by for good this time.</p>

<p>EMMA--For good?</p>

<p>BENNY--Yep. I've got to beat it. I ain't got no home here no
more. Ma and Uncle Caleb, they've chucked me out.</p>

<p>EMMA--Good gracious, what're you saying?</p>

<p>BENNY--That's what Ma come over to tell me--that Uncle Caleb'd
said I'd never get another cent from him, alive or after he's
dead, and she said for me to git back to the army and never to
come home again.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>gasping</i>) She was only joking. She--they couldn't
mean it.</p>

<p>BENNY--If you'd heard her you wouldn't think she was
joking.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>as he makes a movement as if to go away</i>) Benny!
You can't go! Go, and me never see you again, maybe! You can't! I
won't have it!</p>

<p>BENNY--I got to, Emmer. What else is there for me to do when
they've throwed me out? I don't give a damn about leaving
them--but I hate to leave you and never see you again.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>excitedly--grabbing his arm</i>) You can't! I won't
let you go!</p>

<p>BENNY--I don't want to--but what can I do?</p>

<p>EMMA--You can stay here with me.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>his eyes gleaming with satisfaction</i>) No, I
couldn't. You know this dump of a town. Folks would be sayin' all
sorts of bad things in no time. I don't care for myself. They're
all down on me anyway because I'm diff'rent from small-town boobs
like them and they hate me for it.</p>

<p>EMMA--Yes, you are diff'rent. And I'll show 'em I'm diff'rent,
too. You can stay with me--and let 'em gossip all they've a mind
to!</p>

<p>BENNY--No, it wouldn't be actin' square with you. I got to go.
And I'll try to save up my pay and send you back what I've
borrowed now and again.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>more and more wrought up</i>) I won't hear of no
such thing. Oh, I can't understand your Ma and your Uncle Caleb
bein' so cruel!</p>

<p>BENNY--Folks have been lyin' to her about me, like I told you,
and she's told him. He's only too glad to believe it, too, long
as it's bad.</p>

<p>EMMA--I can talk to your Uncle Caleb. He's always minded me
more'n her.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>hastily</i>) Don't do that, for God's sake! You'd
only make it worse and get yourself in Dutch with him, too!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>bewilderedly</i>) But--I--don't see--</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>roughly</i>) Well, he's still stuck on you, ain't
he?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with a flash of coquetry</i>) Now, Benny!</p>

<p>BENNY--I ain't kiddin'. This is dead serious. He's stuck on
you and you know it.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>coyly</i>) I haven't given him the slightest reason
to hope in thirty years.</p>

<p>BENNY--Well, he hopes just the same. Sure he does! Why Ma said
when she was here just now she'd bet you and him'd be married
some day yet.</p>

<p>EMMA--No such thing! Why, she must be crazy!</p>

<p>BENNY--Oh, she ain't so crazy. Ain't he spent every durn
evenin' of the time he's to home between trips over here with
you--for the last thirty years?</p>

<p>EMMA--When I broke my engagement I said I wanted to stay
friends like we'd been before, and we always have; but every time
he'd even hint at bein' engaged again I'd always tell him we was
friends only and he'd better leave it be that way. There's never
been nothing else between us. (<i>with a coy smile</i>) And
besides, Benny, you know how little time he's had to home between
viges.</p>

<p>BENNY--I kin remember the old cuss marchin' over here every
evenin' he was to home since I was a kid.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with a titter of delight</i>) D'you know, Benny, I
do actually believe you're jealous!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>loudly--to lend conviction</i>) Sure I'm jealous!
But that ain't the point just now. The point is <i>he's</i>
jealous of me--and you can see what a swell chance you've got of
talkin' him over now, can't you! You'd on'y make him madder.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>embarrassedly</i>) He's getting foolish. What cause
has he got--</p>

<p>BENNY--When Ma tells him the lies about us--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>excitedly</i>) What lies?</p>

<p>BENNY--I ain't goin' to repeat 'em to you but you kin guess,
can't you, me being so much over here?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>springing to her feet--shocked but pleased</i>)
Oh!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>turning away from her</i>) And now I'm going to
blow. I'll stay at Bill Grainger's tonight and get the morning
train.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>grabbing his arm</i>) No such thing! You'll stay
right here!</p>

<p>BENNY--I can't--Emmer. If you was really my aunt, things'd be
diff'rent and I'd tell 'em all to go to hell.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>smiling at him coquettishly</i>) But I'm glad I
ain't your aunt.</p>

<p>BENNY--Well, I mean if you was related to me in some way.
(<i>At some noise he hears from without, he starts
frightenedly.</i>) Gosh, that sounded like our front door
slamming. It's him and he's coming over. I got to beat it out the
back way. (<i>He starts for the door on the right.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>clinging to him</i>) Benny! Don't go! You mustn't
go!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>inspired by alarm and desire for revenge suddenly
blurts out</i>) Say, let's me 'n' you git married,
Emmer--tomorrow, eh? Then I kin stay! That'll stop 'em, damn 'em,
and make 'em leave me alone.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>dazed with joy</i>) Married? You 'n' me? Oh, Benny,
I'm too old. (<i>She hides her head on his shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>hurriedly, with one anxious eye on the door</i>)
No, you ain't! Honest, you ain't! You're the best guy in this
town! (<i>shaking her in his anxiety</i>) Say yes, Emmer! Say you
will--first thing tomorrow.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>choking with emotion</i>) Yes--I will--if I'm not
too old for you.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>jubilantly</i>) Tell him. Then he'll see where he
gets off! Listen! I'm goin' to beat it to the kitchen and wait.
You come tell me when he's gone. (<i>A knock comes at the door.
He whispers</i>) That's him. I'm goin'.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>embracing him fiercely</i>) Oh, Benny! (<i>She
kisses him on the lips. He ducks away from her and disappears off
right. The knock is repeated. Emma dabs tremblingly at her cheeks
with a handkerchief. Her face is beaming with happiness and looks
indescribably silly. She trips lightly to the door and opens
it--forcing a light, careless tone</i>) Oh, it's you, Caleb. Come
right in and set. I was kind of expecting you. Benny--I'd heard
you was due to home tonight. (<i>He comes in and shakes the hand
she holds out to him in a limp, vague, absent-minded manner. In
appearance, he has changed but little in the thirty years save
that his hair is now nearly white and his face more deeply lined
and wrinkled. His body is still erect, strong and vigorous. He
wears dark clothes, much the same as he was dressed in Act
One.</i>)</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>mechanically</i>) Hello, Emmer. (<i>Once inside the
door, he stands staring about the room, frowning. The garish
strangeness of everything evidently repels and puzzles him. His
face wears its set expression of an emotionless mask but his eyes
cannot</i> <i>conceal an inward struggle, a baffled and painful
attempt to comprehend, a wounded look of bewildered
hurt.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>blithely indifferent to this--pleasantly</i>) Are
you looking at the changes I've made? You ain't seen this room
since, have you? Of course not. What am I thinking of? They only
got through with the work two weeks ago. Well, what d' you think
of it?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>frowning--hesitatingly</i>) Why--it's--all right, I
reckon.</p>

<p>EMMA--It was so gloomy and old-timey before, I just couldn't
bear it. Now it's light and airy and young-looking, don't you
think? (<i>with a sigh</i>) I suppose Pa and Ma turned over in
their graves.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>grimly</i>) I reckon they did, too.</p>

<p>EMMA--Why, you don't mean to tell me you don't like it
neither, Caleb? (<i>then as he doesn't reply--resentfully</i>)
Well, you always was a sot, old-fashioned critter, Caleb
Williams, same as they was. (<i>She plumps herself into a rocker
by the table--then, noticing the lost way in which he is looking
about him</i>) Gracious sakes, why don't you set, Caleb? You give
me the fidgets standing that way! You ain't a stranger that's got
to be invited, are you? (<i>Then suddenly realizing the cause of
his discomfiture, she smiles pityingly, not without a trace of
malice.</i>) Are you looking for your old chair you used to set
in? Is that it? Well, I had it put up in the attic. It didn't fit
in with them new things.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>dully</i>) No, I s'pose it wouldn't.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>indicating a chair next to hers</i>) Do set down and
make yourself to home. (<i>He does so gingerly. After a pause she
asks perfunctorily</i>) Did you have good luck this voyage?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>again dully</i>) Oh, purty fair. (<i>He begins to
look at her as if he were seeing her for the first time, noting
every detail with a numb, stunned astonishment.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--You're looking as well as ever.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>dully</i>) Oh, I ain't got nothin' to complain
of.</p>

<p>EMMA--You're the same as me, I reckon. (<i>happily</i>) Why I
seem to get feelin' younger and more chipper every day, I declare
I do. (<i>She becomes uncomfortably aware of his
examination--nervously</i>) Land sakes, what you starin' at
so?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>brusquely blurting out his disapproval</i>) You've
changed, Emmer--changed so I wouldn't know you, hardly.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>resentfully</i>) Well, I hope you think it's for the
best.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>evasively</i>) I ain't enough used to it yet--to
tell.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>offended</i>) I ain't old-timey and old-maidy like I
was, I guess that's what you mean. Well, I just got tired of
mopin' alone in this house, waiting for death to take me and not
enjoyin' anything. I was gettin' old before my time. And all at
once, I saw what was happenin' and I made up my mind I was going
to get some fun out of what Pa'd left me while I was still in the
prime of life, as you might say.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>severely</i>) Be that paint and powder you got on
your face, Emmer?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>embarrassed by this direct question</i>) Why, yes--I
got a little mite--it's awful good for your complexion, they
say--and in the cities now all the women wears it.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>sternly</i>) The kind of women I've seed in cities
wearin' it--(<i>He checks himself and asks abruptly</i>) Wa'n't
your hair turnin' gray last time I was to home?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>flustered</i>) Yes--yes--so it was--but then it
started to come in again black as black all of a sudden.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>glancing at her shoes, stockings, and dress</i>)
You're got up in them things like a young girl goin' to a
dance.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>forcing a defiant laugh</i>) Maybe I will go soon's
I learn--and Benny's goin' to teach me.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>keeping his rage in control--heavily</i>)
Benny--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>suddenly bursting into hysterical tears</i>) And I
think it's real mean of you, Caleb--nasty mean to come here on
your first night to home--and--make--fun--of--my--clothes--and
everything. (<i>She hides her face in her hands and
sobs.</i>)</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>overcome by remorse--forgetting his rage
instantly--gets up and pats her on the shoulder--with rough
tenderness</i>) Thar, thar, Emmer! Don't cry, now! I didn' mean
nothin'. Don't pay no 'tention to what I said. I'm a durned old
fool! What the hell do I know o' women's fixin's anyhow? And I
reckon I be old-fashioned and sot in my ideas.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>reassured--pressing one of his hands gratefully</i>)
It hurts--hearing you say--me 'n' you such old friends and--</p>

<p>CALEB--Forgit it, Emmer. I won't say no more about it. (<i>She
dries her eyes and regains her composure. He goes back to his</i>
<i>seat, his face greatly softened, looking at her with the blind
eyes of love. There is a pause. Finally, he ventures in a gentle
tone</i>) D'you know what time this be, Emmer?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>puzzled</i>) I don't know exactly, but there's a
clock in the next room.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>quickly</i>) Hell, I don't mean that kind o' time.
I mean--it was thirty years ago this spring.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>hastily</i>) Land sakes, don't let's talk of that.
It only gets me thinking how old I am.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>with an affectionate smile</i>) We both got to
realize now and then that we're gettin' old.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>bridling</i>) That's all right for you to say.
You're twelve years older 'n me, don't forget, Caleb.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>smiling</i>) Waal, even that don't make you out no
spring chicken, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>stiffly</i>) A body's as old as they feels--and I
feel right young.</p>

<p>CALEB--Waal, so do I as far as health goes. I'm as able and
sound as ever. (<i>after a pause</i>) But, what I meant was,
d'you remember what happened thirty years back?</p>

<p>EMMA--I suppose I do.</p>

<p>CALEB--D'you remember what I said that day?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>primly</i>) You said a lot that it's better to
forget, if you ask me.</p>

<p>CALEB--I don't mean--that part of it. I mean when I was sayin'
good-by, I said--(<i>He gasps--then blurts it out.</i>) I said
I'd wait thirty years--if need be. (<i>after a pause</i>) I know
you told me time and again not to go back to that. On'y--I was
thinkin' all this last vige--that maybe--now when the thirty
years are past--I was thinkin' that maybe--(<i>He looks at her
humbly, imploring some encouragement. She stares straight before
her, her mouth set thinly. He sighs forlornly and blunders
on.</i>) Thirty years--that's a hell of a long time to wait,
Emmer--makin' vige after vige always alone--and feelin' even more
alone in between times when I was to home livin' right next door
to you and callin' on you every evenin'. (<i>a pause</i>) I've
made money enough, I know--but what the hell good's that to
me--long as you're out of it? (<i>a pause</i>) Seems to me,
Emmer, thirty o' the best years of a man's life ought to be proof
enough to you to make you forget--that one slip o' mine.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>rousing herself--forcing a careless tone</i>) Land
sakes, I forgot all about that long ago. And here you go
remindin' me of it!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>doggedly</i>) You ain't answered what I was drivin'
at, Emmer. (<i>A pause; then, as if suddenly afraid of what her
answer will be, he breaks out quickly</i>) And I don't want you
to answer right now, neither. I want you to take time to think it
all over.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>feebly evasive</i>) All right, Caleb, I'll think it
over.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>after a pause</i>) Somehow--seems to me 's if--you
might really <i>need</i> me now. You never did before.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>suspiciously</i>) Why should I need you now any
more'n any other time?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>embarrassedly</i>) Oh, I just feel that way.</p>

<p>EMMA--It ain't count o' nothin' Harriet's been tellin' you, is
it? (<i>stiffly</i>) Her 'n' me ain't such good friends no more,
if you must know.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>frowning</i>) Her 'n' me nearly had a fight right
before I came over here. (<i>Emma starts.</i>) Harriet lets her
tongue run away with her and says dumb fool things she don't
really mean. I didn't pay much 'tention to what she was
sayin'--but it riled me jest the same. She won't repeat such
foolishness after the piece o' my mind I gave her.</p>

<p>EMMA--What did she say?</p>

<p>CALEB--Oh, nothin' worth tellin'. (<i>a pause</i>) But neither
you nor me ought to get mad at Harriet serious. We'd ought, by
all rights, to make allowances for her. You know 's well as me
what a hard time she's had. Bein' married to Alf Rogers for five
years'd pizin' any woman's life.</p>

<p>EMMA--No, he wasn't much good, there's no denyin'.</p>

<p>CALEB--And now there's Benny drivin' her crazy.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>instantly defensive</i>) Benny's all right!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>staring at her sharply--after a pause</i>) No,
that's jest it. He ain't all right, Emmer.</p>

<p>EMMA--He is, too! He's as good as gold!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>frowning--with a trace of resentment</i>) You kin
say so, Emmer, but the facts won't bear you out.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>excitedly</i>) What facts, Caleb Williams? If you
mean the nasty lies the folks in this town are mean enough to
gossip about him, I don't believe any of 'em. I ain't such a
fool.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>bitterly</i>) Then you've changed, Emmer. You
didn't stop about believin' the fool stories they gossiped about
me that time.</p>

<p>EMMA--You owned up yourself that was true!</p>

<p>CALEB--And Benny'd own up if he was half the man I was!
(<i>angrily</i>) But he ain't a man noways. He's a mean skunk
from truck to keelson!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>springing to her feet</i>) Oh!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>vehemently</i>) I ain't judged him by what folks
have told me. But I've watched him grow up from a boy and every
time I've come to home I've seed he was gittin' more 'n' more
like his Pa--and you know what a low dog Alf Rogers turned out to
be, and what a hell he made for Harriet. Waal, I'm sayin' this
boy Benny is just Alf all over again--on'y worse!</p>

<p>EMMA--Oh!</p>

<p>CALEB--They ain't no Williams' blood left in Benny. He's a
mongrel Rogers! (<i>trying to calm himself a little and be
convincing</i>) Listen, Emmer. You don't suppose I'd be sayin'
it, do you, if it wasn't so? Ain't he Harriet's boy? Ain't I
brought him up in my own house since he was knee-high? Don't you
know I got some feelin's 'bout it and I wouldn't hold nothing
agen him less'n I knowed it was true?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>harshly</i>) Yes, you would! You're only too anxious
to believe all the bad you can about him. You've always hated
him, he says--and I can see it's so.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>roughly</i>) You know damned well it ain't, you
mean! Ain't I talked him over with you and asked your advice
about him whenever I come to home? Ain't I always aimed to do all
I could to help him git on right? You know damned well I never
hated him! It's him that's always hated me! (<i>vengefully</i>)
But I'm beginning to hate him now--and I've good cause for
it!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>frightenedly</i>) What cause?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>ignoring her question</i>) I seed what he was
comin' to years back. Then I thought when the war come, and he
was drafted into it, that the army and strict discipline'd maybe
make a man o' him. But it ain't! It's made him worse! It's killed
whatever mite of decency was left in him. And I reckon now that
if you put a coward in one of them there uniforms, he thinks it
gives him the privilege to be a bully! Put a sneak in one and it
gives him the courage to be a thief! That's why when the war was
over Benny enlisted again 'stead o' goin' whalin' with me. He
thinks he's found a good shield to cover up his natural-born
laziness--and crookedness!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>outraged</i>) You can talk that way about him that
went way over to France to shed his blood for you and me!</p>

<p>CALEB--I don't need no one to do my fightin' for me--against
German or devil. And you know durned well he was only in the
Quartermaster's Department unloadin' and truckin' groceries, as
safe from a gun as you and me be this minute. (<i>with heavy
scorn</i>) If he shed any blood, he must have got a nose
bleed.</p>

<p>EMMA--Oh, you do hate him, I can see it! And you're just as
mean as mean, Caleb Williams! All you've said is a wicked lie and
you've got no cause--</p>

<p>CALEB--I ain't, eh? I got damned good cause, I tell ye! I
ain't minded his meanness to me. I ain't even give as much heed
to his meanness to Harriet as I'd ought to have, maybe. But when
he starts in his sneakin' thievery with you, Emmer, I put my foot
down on him for good and all!</p>

<p>EMMA--What sneakin' thievery with me? How dare you say such
things?</p>

<p>CALEB--I got proof it's true. Why, he's even bragged all over
town about bein' able to borrow all the money from you he'd a
mind to--boastin' of what an old fool he was makin' of you, with
you fixin' up your house all new to git him to comin' over.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>scarlet--blazing</i>) It's a lie! He never said it!
You're makin' it all up--'cause you're--'cause you're--</p>

<p>CALEB--'Cause I'm what, Emmer?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>flinging it at him like a savage taunt</i>) 'Cause
you're jealous of him, that's what! Any fool can see that!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>getting to his feet and facing her--slowly</i>)
Jealous? Of Benny? How--I don't see your meanin' rightly.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>with triumphant malice</i>) Yes, you do! Don't
pretend you don't! You're jealous 'cause you know I care a lot
about him.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>slowly</i>) Why would I be jealous 'count o' that?
What kind o' man d'you take me for? Don't I know you must care
for him when you've been a'most as much a mother to him for years
as Harriet was?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>wounded to the quick--furiously</i>) No such thing!
You're a mean liar! I ain't never played a mother to him. He's
never looked at me that way--never! And I don't care for him that
way at all. Just because I'm a mite older 'n him--can't them
things happen just as well as any other--what d'you
suppose--can't I care for him same as any woman cares for a man?
And I do! I care more'n I ever did for you! And that's why you're
lying about him! You're jealous of that!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>staring at her with stunned eyes--in a hoarse
whisper</i>) Emmer! Ye don't know what you're sayin', do ye?</p>

<p>EMMA--I do too!</p>

<p>CALEB--Harriet said you'd been actin' out o' your right
senses.</p>

<p>EMMA--Harriet's mad because she knows Benny loves me better 'n
her. And he does love me! He don't mind my bein' older. He's said
so! And I love him, too!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>stepping back from her in horror</i>) Emmer!</p>

<p>EMMA--And he's asked me to marry him tomorrow. And I'm going
to! Then you can all lie all you've a mind to!</p>

<p>CALEB--You're--going to--marry Benny?</p>

<p>EMMA--First thing tomorrow. And since you've throwed him out
of his house in your mad jealousness, I've told him he can stay
here with me tonight. And he's going to!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>his fists clenching--tensely</i>) Where--where is
the skunk now?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>hastily</i>) Oh, he ain't here. He's gone up
street.</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>starting for the door in rear</i>) I'm goin' to
find the skunk.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>seizing his arms--frightenedly</i>) What're you
going to do?</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>between his clenched teeth</i>) I don't know,
Emmer--I don't know--On'y he ain't goin' to marry you, by
God!</p>

<p>EMMA--Caleb! (<i>She tries to throw her arms about him to stop
his going. He pushes her firmly but gently aside. She
shrieks</i>) Caleb! (<i>She flings herself on her knees and wraps
her arms around his legs in supplicating terror.</i>) Caleb! You
ain't going to kill him, Caleb? You ain't going to hurt him, be
you? Say you ain't! Tell me you won't hurt him! (<i>as she thinks
she sees a relenting softness come into his face as he looks down
at her</i>) Oh, Caleb, you used to say you loved me! Don't hurt
him then, Caleb,--for my sake! I love him, Caleb! Don't hurt
him--just because you think I'm an old woman ain't no reason--and
I won't marry you, Caleb. I won't--not even if you have waited
thirty years. I don't love you. I love him! And I'm going to
marry him--tomorrow. So you won't hurt him, will you, Caleb--not
when I ask you on my knees!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>breaking away from her with a shudder of
disgust</i>) No, I won't touch him. If I was wantin' to git even
with ye, I wouldn't dirty my hands on him. I'd let you marry the
skunk and set and watch what happened--or else I'd offer him
money not to marry ye--more money than the little mite you kin
bring him--and let ye see how quick he'd turn his back on ye!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>getting to her feet--frenziedly</i>) It's a lie! He
never would!</p>

<p>CALEB--(<i>unheeding--with a sudden ominous calm</i>) But I
ain't goin' to do neither. You ain't worth it--and he ain't--and
no one ain't, nor nothin'. Folks be all crazy and rotten to the
core and I'm done with the whole kit and caboodle of 'em. I kin
only see one course out for me and I'm goin' to take it. "A dead
whale or a stove boat!" we says in whalin'--and my boat is stove!
(<i>He strides away from her, stops, and turns
back--savagely</i>) Thirty o' the best years of my life flung for
a yeller dog like him to feed on. God! You used to say you was
diff'rent from the rest o' folks. By God, if you are, it's just
you're a mite madder'n they be! By God, that's all! (<i>He goes,
letting the door slam to behind him.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>in a pitiful whimper</i>) Caleb! (<i>She sinks into
a chair by the table sobbing hysterically. Benny sneaks through
the door on right, hesitates for a while, afraid that his uncle
may be coming back.</i>)</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>finally, in a shrill whisper</i>) Aunt Emmer!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>raising her face to look at him for a second</i>)
Oh, Benny! (<i>She falls to weeping again.</i>)</p>

<p>BENNY--Say, you don't think he's liable to come back, do
you?</p>

<p>EMMA--No--he'll--never come back here--no more. (<i>sobs
bitterly</i>)</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>his courage returning, comes forward into the
room</i>) Say, he's way up in the air, ain't he? (<i>with a
grin</i>) Say, that was some bawlin' out he give you!</p>

<p>EMMA--You--you heard what he said?</p>

<p>BENNY--Sure thing. When you got to shoutin' I sneaked out o'
the kitchen into there to hear what was goin' on. (<i>with a
complacent grin</i>) Say, you certainly stood up for me all
right. You're a good old scout at that, d'you know it?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>raising her absurd, besmeared face to his, as if
expecting him to kiss her</i>) Oh, Benny, I'm giving up
everything I've held dear all my life for your sake.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>turning away from her with a look of aversion</i>)
Well, what about it? Ain't I worth it? Ain't I worth a million
played-out old cranks like him? (<i>She stares at him
bewilderedly. He takes a handful of almonds from his pocket and
begins cracking and eating them, throwing the shells on the floor
with an impudent carelessness.</i>) Hope you don't mind my havin'
a feed? I found them out in the kitchen and helped myself.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>pitifully</i>) You're welcome to anything that's
here, Benny.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>insolently</i>) Sure, I know you're a good scout.
Don't rub it in. (<i>after a pause--boastfully</i>) Where did you
get that stuff about askin' him not to hurt me? He'd have a swell
chance! There's a lot of hard guys in the army have tried to get
funny with me till I put one over on 'em. I'd like to see him
start something! I could lick him with my hands handcuffed.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>revolted</i>) Oh!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>resentfully</i>) Think I'm bluffin'? I'll show you
sometime. (<i>He swaggers about the room--finally stopping beside
her. With a cunning leer</i>) Say, I been thinkin' it over and I
guess I'll call his bluff.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>confusedly</i>) What--do you mean?</p>

<p>BENNY--I mean what he said just before he beat it--that he
could get me not to marry you if he offered me more coin than you
got. (<i>very interestedly</i>) Say, d'you s'pose the old miser
really was serious about that?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>dazedly--as if she could not realize the
significance of his words</i>) I--I--don't know, Benny.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>swaggering about again</i>) If I was only sure he
wasn't stallin'! If I could get the old cuss to shell out that
way! (<i>with a tickled chuckle</i>) Gosh, that'd be the real
stunt aw right, aw right. Oui, oui! Maybe he wasn't kiddin' at
that, the old simp! It's worth takin' a stab at, damned if it
ain't. I ain't got nothin' to lose.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>frightenedly</i>) What--what're you talkin' about,
Benny?</p>

<p>BENNY--Say, I think I'll go over and talk to Ma after a while.
You can go over first to make sure he ain't there. I'll get her
to put it up to him straight. If he's willin' to dig in his jeans
for some real coin--real dough, this time!--I'll agree to beat it
and not spill the beans for him with you. (<i>threateningly</i>)
And if he's too tight, I'll go right through with what I said I
would, if only to spite him! That's me!</p>

<p>EMMA--You mean--if he's willing to bribe you with money, you
won't marry me tomorrow?</p>

<p>BENNY--Sure! If he'll put up enough money. I won't stand for
no pikin'.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>whimpering</i>) Oh, Benny, you're only jokin', ain't
you? You can't--you can't mean it!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>with careless effrontery</i>) Why can't I? Sure I
mean it!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>hiding her face in her hands--with a tortured
moan</i>) Oh, Benny!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>disgustedly</i>) Aw, don't go bawlin'! (<i>after a
pause--a bit embarrassedly</i>) Aw, say, what d'you think,
anyway? What're you takin' it so damned serious for--me askin'
you to marry me, I mean? I was on'y sort of kiddin' anyway--just
so you'd tell him and get his goat right. (<i>as she looks up at
him with agonized despair--with a trace of something like pity
showing in his tone</i>) Say, honest, Aunt Emmer, you didn't
believe--you didn't think I was really stuck on you, did you? Ah,
say, how could I? Have a heart! Why, you're as old as Ma is,
ain't you, Aunt Emmer? (<i>He adds ruthlessly</i>) And I'll say
you look it, too!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>cowering--as if he had struck her</i>) Oh! Oh!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>a bit irritated</i>) What's the use of blubberin',
for God's sake? Can't you take it like a sport? Hell, I ain't
lookin' to marry no one, if I can help it. What do I want a wife
for? There's too many others. (<i>after a pause--as she still
sobs--calculatingly</i>) Aw, come on, be a sport--and say,
listen, if he ain't willin' to come across, I'll marry you all
right, honest I will. (<i>more and more calculatingly</i>) Sure!
If they mean that stuff about kickin' me out of home--sure I'll
stay here with you! I'll do anything you want. If you want me to
marry you, all you've got to do is say so--anytime! Only not
tomorrow, we'd better wait and see--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>hysterically</i>) Oh, go away! Go away!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>looking down at her disgustedly</i>) Aw, come up
for air, can't you? (<i>He slaps her on the back.</i>) Buck up!
Be a pal! Tell me what your dope is. This thing's got me so
balled up I don't know how I stand. (<i>with sudden fury</i>)
Damn his hide! I'll bet he'll go and leave all he's got to some
lousy orphan asylum now.</p>

<p>EMMA--Oh, go away! Go away!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>viciously</i>) So you're givin' me the gate, too,
eh? I'd like to see you try it! You asked me to stay and I'll
stick. It's all your fool fault that's got me in wrong. And now
you want to shake me! This is what I get for foolin' around with
an old hen like you that oughta been planted in the cemetery long
ago! Paintin' your old mush and dressin' like a kid! Christ
A'mighty!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>in a cry of despair</i>) Don't! Stop! Go away.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>suddenly alert--sharply</i>) Sh! I hear someone
coming. (<i>shaking her</i>) Stop--now, Emmer! Damn it, you gotta
go to the door. Maybe it's him. (<i>He scurries into the room on
right. There is a faint knock at the door. Emma lifts her head.
She looks horribly old and worn out. Her face is frozen into an
expressionless mask, her eyes are red-rimmed, dull and lifeless.
The knock is repeated more sharply. Emma rises like a weary
automaton and goes to the door and opens it. Harriet is revealed
standing outside.</i>)</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>making no movement to come in--coldly</i>) I want
to speak to Caleb.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>dully</i>) He ain't here. He left a while back--said
he was goin' up street--I think.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>worriedly</i>) Oh, land sakes! (<i>then
hostilely</i>) Do you know where Benny is?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>dully</i>) Yes, he's here.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>contemptuously</i>) I might have guessed that!
(<i>icily formal</i>) Would you mind tellin' him I want to see
him?</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>turns and calls</i>) Benny! Here's your Ma!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>comes from the next room</i>) Aw right. (<i>in a
fierce whisper as he passes Emma</i>) What d'you tell her I was
here for, you old fool? (<i>Emma gives no sign of having heard
him but comes back to her chair and sits down. Benny slouches to
the door--sullenly</i>) What d'you want, Ma?</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>coldly</i>) I wanted your Uncle Caleb, not you,
but you'll have to do, bein' the only man about.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>suspiciously</i>) What is it?</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>a bit frightenedly</i>) I just heard a lot of
queer noises down to the barn. Someone's in there, Benny, sure as
I'm alive. They're stealin' the chickens, must be.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>carelessly</i>) It's only the rats.</p>

<p>HARRIET--(<i>angrily</i>) Don't play the idiot! This was a big
thumpin' noise no rat'd make.</p>

<p>BENNY--What'd any guy go stealin' this early--(<i>as Harriet
turns away angrily--placatingly</i>) Aw right, I'm coming. I'll
have a look if that'll satisfy you. Don't go gettin' sore at me
again. (<i>While he is speaking he goes out and disappears after
his mother. Emma sits straight and stiff in her chair for a
while, staring before her with waxy eyes. Then she gets to her
feet and goes from window to window taking down all the curtains
with quick mechanical movements. She throws them on a pile in the
middle of the floor. She lifts down the framed pictures from the
walls and piles them on the curtains. She takes the cushions and
throws them on; pushes the rugs to the pile with her feet; sweeps
everything off the table onto the floor. She does all this
without a trace of change in her expression--rapidly, but with no
apparent effort. There is the noise of running footsteps from
outside and Benny bursts into the room panting for breath. He is
terribly excited and badly frightened.</i>)</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>stops short as he sees the pile on the floor</i>)
What the hell--</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>dully</i>) The junk man's coming for them in the
morning.</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>too excited to be surprised</i>) To hell with that!
Say, listen Aunt Emmer, he's hung himself--Uncle Caleb--in the
barn--he's dead!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>slowly letting the words fall--like a beginner on
the typewriter touching two new letters</i>) Caleb--dead!</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>voluble now</i>) Dead as a door nail! Neck's
busted. I just cut him down and carried him to home. Say, you've
got to come over and help look after Ma. She's goin' bugs. I
can't do nothin' with her.</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>as before</i>) Caleb hanged himself--in the
barn?</p>

<p>BENNY--Yes--and made a sure job of it. (<i>with morbid
interest in the details</i>) He got a halter and made a noose of
the rope for his neck and climbed up in the loft and hitched the
leather end to a beam and then let himself drop. He must have
kicked in that quick! (<i>He snaps his fingers--then
urgently</i>) Say, come on. Come on over 'n' help me with Ma,
can't you? She's goin' wild. I can't do nothin'!</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>vaguely</i>) I'll be over--in a minute. (<i>then
with a sudden air of having decided something irrevocably</i>) I
got to go down to the barn.</p>

<p>BENNY--Barn? Say, are you crazy? He ain't there now. I told
you I carried him home.</p>

<p>EMMA--I mean--my barn. I got to go down--</p>

<p>BENNY--(<i>exasperated</i>) Oh hell! You're as bad as Ma!
Everyone's lost their heads but me. Well, I got to get someone
else, that's all. (<i>He rushes out rear, slamming the door
behind him.</i>)</p>

<p>EMMA--(<i>after a tense pause--with a sudden outburst of wild
grief</i>) Caleb! (<i>then in a strange whisper</i>) Wait, Caleb,
I'm going down to the barn. (<i>She moves like a sleepwalker
toward the door in the rear as</i></p>
