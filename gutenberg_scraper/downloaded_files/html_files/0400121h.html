</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Courtyard of Ibnu Aswad's palace in Granada.</i></p>

<p><i>The section forms a right triangle, its apex at the rear,
right. In the left, center, a massive porte-coch&egrave;re opens
on the street. On the right, a door leading into the house
itself. In the center of the courtyard, a large splendid fountain
of green marble with human and animal figures in gilt bronze. The
peristyle of the gallery running around the court is supported by
slender columns of polished marble, partly gilded. The
interspaces above the horseshoe arches springing from the columns
are filled with arabesques, texts from the Koran, red, blue and
gold in color. Above are the latticed windows of the women's
apartments. Over the house-top a sky with stars can be seen. It
is early night.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, the court is empty and there is
silence except for the splash of the fountain. Then a loud,
imperious knocking, as of someone pounding with the hilt of a
sword, is heard from the porte-coch&egrave;re. Ibnu Aswad enters
from the right. He is an elderly, noble-looking Moor, the lower
part of his face covered by a long, white beard. His expression
is one of great pride borne down by sorrow and humiliation. He
goes out through the porte-coch&egrave;re, and returns ushering
in Juan Ponce de Leon and his servant, Pedro. Juan is a tall,
handsome Spanish noble of thirty-one, dressed in full uniform.
His countenance is haughty, full of a romantic adventurousness
and courage; yet he gives the impression of disciplined ability,
of a confident self-mastery--a romantic dreamer governed by the
ambitious thinker in him. Pedro is a dull-looking young
fellow.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>as they enter--to Aswad</i>) Your pardon, Sir
Moor.</p>

<p>ASWAD--(<i>haughtily</i>) You are quartered here? (<i>Juan
bows in affirmation.</i>) Welcome then, since it is the will of
Allah that you should conquer.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>graciously</i>) I am no conquerer here. I am a
stranger grateful for hospitality.</p>

<p>ASWAD--(<i>unbending a bit</i>) You are kind. I have seen you
in action on the field. You are brave. Defeat loses its
bitterness when the foe is noble. (<i>moodily and
bitterly--staring at the fountain</i>) The waters of the fountain
fall--but ever they rise again, Sir Spaniard. Such is the decree
of destiny. (<i>with fervor</i>) Blessed be Allah who exalteth
and debaseth the kings of the earth, according to his divine
will, in whose fulfillment consists eternal justice. (<i>fiercely
and defiantly</i>) Whosoever the victor, there is no conqueror
but Allah!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>stiffening--coldly</i>) Your fortitude does you
honor. (<i>by way of dismissing the subject--abruptly</i>) I am
expecting friends. Will that disturb your household? If so--</p>

<p>ASWAD--(<i>coldly</i>) My house is your house. It is decreed.
(<i>He bows with stately grace and goes out, right.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>makes a movement as if to detain him--then shrugs
his shoulders</i>) What can I do for him? (<i>ironically
repeating Ibnu's inflection</i>) It is decreed by Spain if not by
Allah. (<i>seeing Pedro lolling against the wall, drowsily
staring at the fountain--amused</i>) Lazy lout! Does the fountain
cause you, too, to dream? (<i>in a tone of command</i>) Bring the
wine. They will be here soon.</p>

<p>PEDRO--Yes, sir. (<i>He goes. Juan paces back and forth,
humming to himself. Pedro returns and approaches his master
cautiously--in a mysterious whisper</i>) A lady, sir.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frowning</i>) Is she alone? (<i>Pedro nods, Juan
smiles cynically.</i>) Surely you have mistaken her calling. Tell
her I am not here. (<i>As Pedro turns to go, Maria de Cordova
appears in the arch of the porte-coch&egrave;re. A heavy black
veil is thrown over her face.</i>)</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>her voice forced and trembling</i>) Juan!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>immediately the gallant cavalier, makes a motion for
Pedro to leave, and bows low--mockery in his voice</i>) Beautiful
lady, you do me an unmerited honor.</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>wearily</i>) Spare me your mockery, Juan. (<i>She
throws back her veil. She is a striking-looking woman of
thirty-eight or forty, but discontent and sorrow have marked her
age clearly on her face.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>astonished</i>) Maria! (<i>then with genuine
alarm</i>) In God's name!</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>her voice breaking</i>) Juan, I had to come.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>sternly</i>) Your husband is my brother in arms.
Tonight--here--he is to be among my guests. I feel that every
word we speak now degrades me in my honor.</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>in a tone of great grief</i>) You are cruel! I had
to speak with you alone. This is my one chance. I leave the Court
tomorrow.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with evident relief</i>) Ah.</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>stares at him with a pitiful appeal. He avoids her
eyes.</i>) Oh, what a fool I am--(<i>with a half-sob, as if the
confession were wrung from her</i>)--to love you, Juan! (<i>She
makes a movement toward him, but he steps back, aloof and
cold.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frowning</i>) That word--we have never uttered it
before. You have always been--my friend. (<i>after a pause, with
deep earnestness</i>) Why must you ruin our rare friendship for a
word that every minstrel mouths? (<i>then with irritation</i>)
Love, love, love we chatter everlastingly. We pretend love alone
is why we live! Bah! Life is nobler than the weak lies of
poets--or it's nothing!</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>wounded and indignant</i>) If you had had to fight
for love as you have fought for glory!--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>struck by the pain in her tone, kneels and kisses
her hand--remorsefully</i>) Forgive me! I would die rather than
bring sorrow to a heart as kind as yours. Keep me forever in that
heart, I beg--but as a friend--as it has always been.</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>with a gasp of pain</i>) Ah! (<i>taking her hand
from his--with a deep sigh</i>) God give you knowledge of the
heart!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>rises--plainly endeavoring to change the
subject</i>) You are leaving the Court?</p>

<p>MARIA--The Queen has granted my wish to retire to Cordova.
(<i>passionately</i>) I'm sick of the Court! I long for simple
things! I pray to become worthy again of that pure love of God I
knew as a girl. I must seek peace in Him! (<i>after a pause</i>)
Granada is ours. The Moors are driven from Spain. The wars are
over. What will you do now, Juan?</p>

<p>JUAN--Peace means stagnation--a slack ease of cavaliers and
songs and faded roses. I must go on.</p>

<p>MARIA--Where will you go?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>smiles half-whimsically at an idea</i>) Perhaps with
the Genoese, Christopher Columbus, when he sails to find the
western passage to Cathay.</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>disturbed</i>) But they say he is mad.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>seriously now</i>) Mad or not, he dreams of glory. I
have heard he plans to conquer for Spain that immense realm of
the Great Khan which Marco Polo saw.</p>

<p>MARIA--What! Abandon your career at Court now when your
exploits have brought you in such favor? No one would ruin
himself so senselessly save in despair! (<i>jealously</i>) It
must be from love you are fleeing! (<i>fiercely mocking</i>) Is a
woman avenging women? Tell me her name!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with a mocking laugh</i>) Love, love, and always
love! Can no other motive exist for you? God pity women!</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>after a pause--sadly</i>) God pity me--because pity
is what you offer me. (<i>as Juan seems about to protest
wearily</i>) Don't deny it, Juan. It sneers at me in your
pretended scorn of love--You wish to comfort my humiliation! Am I
a fool? Have you not loved others? I could name ten--</p>

<p>JUAN--Maria!</p>

<p>MARIA--Do you imagine I haven't guessed the truth? Those
others had youth--while I--And my love seems to
you--pitiable!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>kneeling and taking her hand--with passionate
earnestness</i>) No, dear friend, no! I swear to you! (<i>after a
pause</i>) What you call loves--they were merely moods--dreams of
a night or two--lustful adventures--gestures of vanity,
perhaps--but I have never loved. Spain is the mistress to whom I
give my heart, Spain and my own ambitions, which are Spain's. Now
do you understand?</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>sadly</i>) No, Juan. (<i>He rises.</i>) I
understand that I am growing old--that love has passed for
me--and that I suffer in my loneliness. Perhaps if God had
granted me a child--But His justice punishes. He has seen my
secret sin. I have loved you, Juan, for years. But it was only in
the last year when my heart, feeling youth die, grew desperate
that I dared let you see. And now, farewell, until God's will be
done in death. We must not meet again.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>sternly</i>) No. (<i>passionately</i>) I wish to God
you had not told me this!</p>

<p>MARIA--(<i>gently</i>) If you are still my friend you will not
wish it. It was my final penance--that you should know. And,
having told you, I am free, for my heart is dead. There is only
my soul left that knows the love of God which blesses and does
not torture. Farewell once more, Juan. (<i>He kneels and
kisses her hand. She puts the other on his head as if blessing
him.</i>) You are noble, the soul of courage, a man of men. You
will go far, soldier of iron--and dreamer. God pity you if those
two selves should ever clash! You shall have all my prayers for
your success--but I shall add, Dear Savior, let him know
tenderness to recompense him when his hard youth dies! (<i>She
turns quickly and goes out.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>looks after her in melancholy thought for a
while--then sighs deeply and shrugs his shoulders</i>) Time
tarnishes even the pure, difficult things with common weakness.
(<i>Luis de Alvaredo enters through the porte-coch&egrave;re. He
is a dissipated-looking noble, a few years older than Juan. His
face is homely but extremely fetching in its nobility, its
expression of mocking fun and raillery. He is dressed carelessly,
is slightly drunk.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>mockingly</i>) Lover of glory, beloved of women,
hail! (<i>He comes to the startled Juan as voices are heard from
the porte-coch&egrave;re--in a hurried, cautioning
whisper</i>) The devil, Juan! Have you lost your wits--or has
she? I recognized her--and Vicente was only ten paces behind.
(<i>then again mockingly</i>) Discretion, my stainless knight,
discretion!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>sternly</i>) Stop! You wrong her and me. (<i>Sounds
of a loud, angry dispute are heard from without.</i>) What is
that brawling?</p>

<p>LUIS--My Moor. (<i>explaining hurriedly to Juan</i>) A fellow
poet--a minstrel of their common folk. We found him running amuck
about the streets declaiming to the stars that their king,
Abdallah, had sold his soul to hell when he surrendered. (<i>with
admiration</i>) By God, Juan, how he cursed! Oh, he's a precious
songster, and as poet to poet I collared him and dragged him with
us. Our friend, Diego, would have cut his throat for the Church's
glory had I not interfered.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>smiling</i>) As madman for madman, eh? But why bring
him here to howl?</p>

<p>LUIS--He has a lute. It is my whim he should sing some verses.
(<i>with an amused grin</i>) The dog speaks only Arabic. If he is
wily, he will chant such curses on our heads as will blight that
fountain dry--and no one of us but me will understand. (<i>with
great glee</i>) It will be sport, Juan! (<i>The clamor from
outside grows more violent.</i>) By God, Diego will murder my
minstrel--after all my pains. (<i>starts to hurry out--stops in
the entrance</i>) Remember, Juan. Vicente may have
recognized--the lady.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>nods, frowning</i>) The devil take all women!
(<i>Luis goes out. Pedro enters, carrying two large baskets full
of bottles and sets them down, rear.</i>) Drink and forget sad
nonsense. Bring out cushions. We will sit beside the fountain.
(<i>Pedro goes into the house, right. Luis re&euml;nters, holding
Yusef by the arm--a wizened old Moor dressed in the clothes of
the common people, but wearing the turban signifying that he has
made the pilgrimage to Mecca. His deep-set eyes smolder with
hatred but physically he is so exhausted as to seem resigned to
his fate. They are followed by Diego Menendez, a Franciscan monk,
about the same age as Juan and Luis. He has a pale, long face,
the thin, cruel mouth, the cold, self-obsessed eyes of the
fanatic. Just now he is full of helpless fury and indignation.
Accompanying him is Vicente de Cordova, a gray-haired, stern,
soldierly noble of forty-five. Following them are the three
nobles, Oviedo, Castillo and Mendoza. They are the type of
adventurous cavaliers of the day--cruel, courageous to
recklessness, practically uneducated--knights of the true Cross,
ignorant of and despising every first principle of real
Christianity--yet carrying the whole off with a picturesque
air.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>angrily</i>) I protest to you, Juan. It is
heresy to suffer this dog's presence when we offer thanks to God
for victory.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>stares at the Moor interestedly for a moment--then
carelessly</i>) I see no desecration, Diego--if he will sing, not
howl. (<i>turning to Vicente, scrutinizing his face
keenly--carelessly</i>) What do you say, Vicente?</p>

<p>VICENTE--(<i>gives him a dark look of suspicion--coldly and
meaningly</i>) I say nothing--now.</p>

<p>JUAN--Ah! (<i>He and Luis exchange a look.</i>)</p>

<p>OVIEDO--Well, I say let him remain. We may have sport with
him.</p>

<p>CASTILLO--(<i>with a cruel smile</i>) Perhaps with a
sword-point we can persuade him to sing where the townsfolk hid
their gold.</p>

<p>MENDOZA--Your words are inspired, Manuel!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>scornfully</i>) Materialists! You would sack heaven
and melt the moon for silver. Juan, where is your wine?
(<i>Pedro</i> <i>appears, bringing cushions and goblets for each.
He uncorks the bottles and pours their goblets full. Scorning a
goblet Luis snatches a bottle from him and drinks from
that.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>keeping a wary eye on Vicente</i>) Let us drink.
(<i>takes a goblet from Pedro</i>) To our most Gracious
Sovereigns and to Spain! (<i>He drinks.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--And to the Church! (<i>angrily</i>) But I will not
drink until that infidel is moved apart!</p>

<p>VICENTE--I agree.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>impatiently</i>) Let the Moor go, Luis--since Diego
takes himself so seriously.</p>

<p>VICENTE--(<i>coldly resentful</i>) And I? (<i>Juan is about to
reply irritably when Luis breaks in hurriedly.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--Shhh! I'll sing a song for you. (<i>releasing the Moor
and pointing to the rear</i>) Go, brother bard, and take your
ease. (<i>The Moor goes to the right, rear, and squats down in
the shadow by the wall. Luis sings</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love is a flower<br>
 Forever blooming.<br>
 Life is a fountain<br>
 Forever leaping<br>
 Upward to catch the golden sunlight,<br>
 Striving to reach the azure heaven;<br>
 Failing, falling,<br>
 Ever returning<br>
 To kiss the earth that the flower may live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>(<i>They all applaud as he finishes.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--Charming, Sir Poet--but a lie. (<i>mockingly</i>) Love,
and love, and always love! The devil seize your flower! Do
fountains flow only to nourish flowers that bloom a day and
die?</p>

<p>LUIS--Roar, lion! You will not wake my dream that life is
love!</p>

<p>JUAN--Listen to him, Diego! We know his only love is his old
mother; and yet, to judge from his songs, you would think him a
greater philanderer than--than--</p>

<p>VICENTE--(<i>interrupting sneeringly</i>) Than you, Don
Juan?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>turning on him--coldly</i>) Gossip gives many a
false name--but gossip only deludes old women.</p>

<p>VICENTE--(<i>growing pale</i>) Do you intend that insult?
(<i>Their</i> <i>hands go to the hilt of their swords. The three
nobles quicken to excited interest. Luis leaps between
them.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--For God's sake! Is either of you a Moor? (<i>raises his
bottle</i>) Let us drink again to Spain!</p>

<p>OVIEDO--And to the next war!</p>

<p>CASTILLO--May it be soon!</p>

<p>MENDOZA--With a world to sack! Sing us a song of that,
Luis!</p>

<p>LUIS--I am too thirsty. But come, I was forgetting our
infidel. Let me use persuasion--(<i>He goes back to the Moor, and
can be heard talking to him in Arabic.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--We were speaking of wars to come. With whom?</p>

<p>OVIEDO--With anyone!</p>

<p>JUAN--But guess. I think it will be in lands beyond strange
seas--Cipango and Cathay--the cities of gold that Marco Polo
saw.</p>

<p>OVIEDO--But who will lead us there?</p>

<p>JUAN--Why, Christopher Columbus. (<i>They all laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>CASTILLO--That Genoese mongrel!--to lead Spaniards!</p>

<p>MENDOZA--He's mad. He claims the earth is round--like an egg!
(<i>They all laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>impressively</i>) I saw him today. He was riding his
flea-bitten mule as if he were a C&aelig;sar in a triumph. His
eyes were full of golden cities.</p>

<p>CASTILLO--Bah, Juan, you romance! The man's an idiot!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>coming back</i>) The more fool you to think so! He
will yet find for Spain the Western Passage to the East.</p>

<p>CASTILLO--Or fall off the world's edge! I will wager you would
not go with him for all the gold in Indies!</p>

<p>LUIS--You would lose!</p>

<p>JUAN--I'm planning to go. (<i>All are astonished.</i>) But not
on his first voyage. Before I pledge my sword I must have proof
that it can serve Spain's glory. There is no profit in staking
life for dreams.</p>

<p>LUIS--There is no profit in anything but that! You're from the
East, Moor. Tell us of the Great Khan, of Cipango and Cathay and
Cambuluc, of golden roofs and emerald-studded lintels to the
doors. Your people must have heard these wonders.</p>

<p>MENDOZA--Yes, let him sing of treasure. (<i>But the Moor
remains silent.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--Wait, I'll talk to him. (<i>He goes back and speaks to
the Moor in Arabic. The latter replies.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>furiously</i>) This is all treasonable. The dog
had broken the peace. The punishment is death.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>mockingly</i>) Let him sing of treasure, Diego. Even
the Church loves gold.</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>coming back--exultantly</i>) He consents,
Juan--because I am a colleague. He will sing of treasure in the
East--a tale told to his father by some wandering poet who came
from Cathay with a caravan. (<i>All except the outraged Diego and
the sullen, preoccupied Vicente quicken to interested attention.
The Moor strikes a few notes on his lute.</i>) Hush! (<i>The Moor
begins a crooning chant of verses, accompanying himself on the
lute. At first they are all held by its strange rhythm, then they
begin to betray impatience.</i>)</p>

<p>OVIEDO--By God, our wolf turns into a sick shepherd.</p>

<p>LUIS--Hush!</p>

<p>CASTILLO--(<i>impatiently</i>) What does he sing?</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>enrapt--vaguely</i>) Hush, hush.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>rising to his feet as the Moor's recitative
abruptly ends--harshly</i>) This is the service in a devil's
mass!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>passes his hand across his eyes, then stares into
the fountain dreamily</i>) He sang of treasure--but strange to
your longing. There is in some far country of the East--Cathay,
Cipango, who knows--a spot that Nature has set apart from men and
blessed with peace. It is a sacred grove where all things live in
the old harmony they knew before man came. Beauty resides there
and is articulate. Each sound is music, and every sight a vision.
The trees bear golden fruit. And in the center of the grove,
there is a fountain--beautiful beyond human dreams, in whose
rainbows all of life is mirrored. In that fountain's waters,
young maidens play and sing and tend it everlastingly for very
joy in being one with it. This is the Fountain of Youth, he said.
The wise men of that far-off land have known it many ages. They
make it their last pilgrimage when sick with years and weary of
their lives. Here they drink, and the years drop from them like a
worn-out robe. Body and mind know youth again, and these young
men, who had been old, leap up and join the handmaids' dance.
Then they go back to life, but with hearts purified, and the old
discords trouble them no more, but they are holy and the folk
revere them. (<i>with a sigh</i>) That's his tale, my
friends--but he added it is hard to find that fountain. Only to
the chosen does it reveal itself.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>furiously</i>) Idolatry!</p>

<p>OVIEDO--Is this his treasure? By God, he mocks us!</p>

<p>LUIS--Fools! Beauty is lost on you. Your souls clink like
coppers. (<i>Menendez slinks back step by step toward the Moor.
Luis grabs a bottle.</i>) Come, let us drink! We'll all to Cathay
with Don Christopher. You can burrow for dung there--but I will
search for this fountain.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>drinking--a bit tipsily</i>) Drink and forget sad
nonsense! The devil! His song beguiled me until you tricked it
into that old woman's mumble. Youth! Is youth a treasure? Then
are we all--except Vicente--priceless rich; and yet, God's blood,
one has but to look to see how poor we are!</p>

<p>LUIS--Poor in spirit! I understand you, Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--Fountain of youth, God help us, with love to boot! I
wish he'd sung instead of the armies and power of the Great Khan!
(<i>then half-aside to Luis</i>) The tale is always told to the
wrong person. There was one here not long ago who would have
given pearls for drops from that same fountain!</p>

<p>VICENTE--(<i>who has crept vengefully toward Juan in time to
hear these last words--with cold fury</i>) A moment ago you
taunted me with age--and now you dare--(<i>He slaps Juan across
the face. They draw their swords.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>trying to intervene</i>) For God's sake,
friends!</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>with excited interest</i>) A duel! (<i>The others
echo this. Suddenly there is a harsh shriek from the rear.
Menendez appears from the shadow, dagger in hand, a look of
fanatical triumph on his face. Forgetting the duel, the others
stand appalled.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>sheathing the dagger</i>) I have slain the dog.
It was high time.</p>

<p>LUIS--Miserable bigot! (<i>Raging, he tries to throw himself
at the monk, but Juan grasps him and forces him down on a
cushion. He breaks down, weeping.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>coldly scornful</i>) What! A soldier of Christ
weep for an infidel!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>sternly</i>) Be still, Diego! (<i>then
frowning--curtly, in a tone of dismissal which silences all
protest</i>) Our reveling is under an ill star. There is blood
upon it. Good-night. (<i>turning to Vicente</i>) Until
tomorrow.</p>

<p>(<i>Vicente bows and goes, accompanied by Menendez. The young
nobles troop out behind, disputing noisily about the coming
duel.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>comes over and puts his hand, on Luis' shoulder--in
a mocking, but comforting tone</i>) Come, Luis. Your brother
romancer is dead. Tears will not help him. Perhaps even now he
drinks of that Fountain of Youth in Dreamland--if he is not in
hell.</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>raising his head</i>) Juan, why do you always sneer
at beauty--while your heart calls you liar?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frowning</i>) I have Spain in my heart--and my
ambition. All else is weakness. (<i>changing his
tone--carelessly</i>) Well, you were right. Vicente
recognized--and so, a duel. I'll prick him in the thigh and send
him home to bed. She will nurse and love him then--and hate me
for a murderer. Thus, all works out for the best in this fair
world! But--a rare thing dies--and I'm sad, Luis. (<i>shaking
himself and taking a goblet of wine</i>) Come, forget sad
nonsense. We will drink to voyaging with Don Christopher--and to
the battles before those golden cities of Cathay!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>recovering his spirits--grabbing a bottle</i>)
Lucifer fire your cities! I drink to my fountain!</p>

<p>JUAN--Your health, Sir Lying Poet!</p>

<p>LUIS--And yours, Sir Glory-Glutton! (<i>They laugh, clink
goblet and bottle, and drink as</i></p>

<h1><a name="s02">SCENE TWO</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>About a year later--Columbus's flagship on the last
day of his second voyage. The section of the vessel shown reveals
the main deck amidships, the mainmast, the mainsail with its
Maltese</i> <i>Cross, the two higher decks of the poop, the
lateen sail on the mizzenmast, etc. Wooden stairs on the
starboard, near the bulwark, are the means of getting from one
deck to another.</i></p>

<p><i>It is the time just preceding the dawn. The ship is sailing
steadily on a calm sea. There is a large lantern at center of the
main deck, another low down in the rigging on the port side,
another over the cross which hangs over the stern from the high
poop. The ship is crowded with people. On the main deck are the
nobles. They are dressed in rich uniforms, in armor. Most of them
are asleep, lying sprawled on the deck, wrapped in their
cloaks--or huddled in hunched attitudes, their backs propped
against the mast or the bulwarks. But one small group has
apparently been awake all night. They are sitting cross-legged,
throwing dice by the light of the lantern. The faces of the
gamesters are haggard and drawn, their eyes feverish. Prominent
among them are Oviedo, Castillo, Mendoza and Luis.</i></p>

<p><i>On the first deck of the poop, the monks, all Franciscans,
are lying asleep. Here, also, are four of the converted Indians
Columbus is bringing back. They are dressed in incongruous
costumes, half savage and half civilized. They are huddled in the
right corner, not asleep, but frozen in a helpless
apathy.</i></p>

<p><i>On the highest deck Juan is seen standing by the pilot who
tends the helm.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>excitedly</i>) Double or quits!</p>

<p>OVIEDO--Done. (<i>They play. Luis loses.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--I am ruined again! (<i>with a comical groan of
despair</i>) Fortune is a damned mercenary wench. She scorns the
poor. (<i>takes up the dice to throw</i>) Once more!</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>grumblingly</i>) No. You owe me more than you can
pay.</p>

<p>LUIS--I will soon be rich as Croesus. Don Columbus says we
will sight land today--the Indies, Isles of Spice, Cipango,
Cathay, who knows what? I will stake my future wealth against
yours. Come! One more cast for anything you wish.</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>dryly</i>) For gold--gold I can see and touch.</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>disgustedly</i>) The devil! I must borrow from Juan
then. (<i>He gets to his feet.</i>)</p>

<p>OVIEDO--He will not thank you to wake him on a beggar's
errand.</p>

<p>LUIS--Do you imagine he sleeps with his Promised Land so near?
He is astern on the Admiral's poop keeping a watch of his
own--for fear the lookout will miss Cathay!</p>

<p>CASTILLO--Juan is over-eager. He will make the Genoese
jealous.</p>

<p>MENDOZA--Has already. It is plain Columbus slights him.</p>

<p>OVIEDO--From policy. He knows Juan is in disgrace at Court
since the duel. Our admiral trims his sails to the wind.</p>

<p>CASTILLO--Juan paid dearly for Vicente's wound--a pinprick
that hardly drew blood.</p>

<p>MENDOZA--It was the scandal.</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>indignantly</i>) All false--the malice of envious
tongues! Vicente himself apologized to Juan. As for the lady,
when I was home in Cordova I saw her with Vicente. You could not
find a more married pair. It was even rumored they were to have a
child--(<i>Juan has come down from the Admiral's poop, passed
through the sleeping monks and now appears by the light of the
lamp in the rigging at the head of the stairs to the main deck.
Luis breaks off suddenly.</i>) Is that you, Juan? Come, be a
brother. This son of luck (<i>he indicates Oviedo</i>) has won
everything but my skin.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with a laugh</i>) Then stake the Fountain of Youth
which you will find--tomorrow! Sold by the cask it should make
you the richest man in Spain. (<i>The nobles laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>with real aversion</i>) What trader's scheming--from
you! (<i>then jokingly</i>) Take care! When the pox of old age is
on you will come begging to me! (<i>then rattling the dice</i>)
But come, loan me gold for a last cast of revenge. (<i>then with
a sudden idea</i>) And you throw for me. My star is behind a
cloud.</p>

<p>OVIEDO--Not fair. Juan always wins.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frowning</i>) This is no time for gaming.</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>insistently</i>) Just once, Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>consenting unwillingly</i>) Only once. The stakes
are yours. Let the cast be an augury for me. (<i>He takes gold
from his purse. He and Oviedo play. Oviedo wins and there is a
murmur of astonishment.</i>)</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>exultantly</i>) I win. The first time I have ever
beat you, Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>getting up</i>) A poor omen. (<i>then mockingly</i>)
But here on the under side of earth these signs must run by
opposites.</p>

<p>MENDOZA--(<i>half frightenedly</i>) Can we be hanging head
down and not know it?</p>

<p>CASTILLO--Bah! The Genoese made his first voyage safely. We
cannot fall off, it seems.</p>

<p>OVIEDO--Columbus may be a liar.</p>

<p>MENDOZA--(<i>savagely</i>) A low-born braggart! He displayed
his origin in the hoggish demands he made on the crown. What
could the Sovereigns be thinking of--to make this foreign upstart
an Admiral and a Viceroy?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>sternly rebuking</i>) It is not for us to question.
(<i>He pauses--then adds</i>) His enterprise has served Spain
well. He is our commander. That is enough to know. (<i>He turns
his back on them and walks to the port side where he stands by
the rigging looking out to sea. The nobles look after him for a
moment in an abashed silence.</i>)</p>

<p>CASTILLO--(<i>mockingly</i>) You are a perfect Christian,
Juan--to love your enemy.</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>yawns</i>) Put out the lantern. Let us sleep. The
dawn will wake us. (<i>Mendoza puts out the lantern. All except
Luis wrap themselves in their robes and lie down on the deck.
Luis comes over to Juan.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>scornfully</i>) Look at those clods. They would
snore through the Last Judgment. (<i>then as Juan is silent</i>)
What are you dreaming of--Cathay and glory?</p>

<p>JUAN--No. (<i>then suddenly</i>) When I came down I heard
Vicente's name--and mention of a child. What were you saying?</p>

<p>LUIS--Gossip of Cordova. My mother told me Maria was having
masses said that she might bear an heir--and the rumor was her
prayers were answered.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with deep sincerity</i>) God grant it. She will be
happy then. (<i>with an ironical laugh</i>) Did I not tell you
that night our duel would reconcile them? (<i>soberly</i>) But I
pay. Well, what matter the cost if Maria wins happiness?</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>reassuringly</i>) One exploit and the Court will be
at your feet again.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>shaking his head</i>) We will be far from Spain--out
of sight and mind. Columbus will be king here, and he and I are
by nature antagonistic. (<i>There is a noise from the higher deck
of the poop. A tall figure can be made out coming up on deck
there from the companionway. He moves back until the light from
the lantern above the cross reveals him. It is Columbus. He is in
full uniform but wears no hat on his long, white hair. A
commanding figure of noble presence, the face full of the ardent,
fixed enthusiasm of the religious devotee.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>pulling Juan back into the shadow</i>) Speak the
devil's name! (<i>They stand, watching and listening, but hidden
from the poop.</i>)</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>to the helmsman</i>) Have you held the
course?</p>

<p>HELMSMAN--Southwest by west, sir.</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>peering about him</i>) Will the dawn never come?
(<i>He comes to the edge of the deck and calls down where the
monks are--in a low voice</i>) Father Menendez. Are you
awake?</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>gets up quickly from among the sleeping
monks</i>) I am here, your Excellency. (<i>He mounts to the deck
above and stands waiting respectfully.</i>)</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>begins in a blunt, perfunctory tone</i>)
Toscanelli's map must be in error. We should have sighted land
before. (<i>A pause. He paces back and forth.</i>) The sun will
soon be up. It leaps from the darkness in these parts. (<i>a
pause, then with evident irritation</i>) A weary voyage, Father!
The spirit of these nobles is perverse. They look on this voyage
as an escapade in search of easy riches, not as a crusade for the
glory of God.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>curtly</i>) They are brave. Many of them have
proven their ability in war--Juan Ponce de Leon, for one.</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>resentfully</i>) A bravo! A duelist!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>in an indignant whisper</i>) The devil seize
him!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>grimly</i>) Another aftermath of that cursed
duel!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>shortly</i>) You are unjust, Excellency.</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--Oh, I admit he possesses all the attributes but the
one which alone gives them virtue--an humble piety. On this great
quest there is no place for egotists who seek only selfish ends.
We must all feel ourselves unworthy servants of God's Holy Will.
(<i>then breaking off--abruptly</i>) But I did not call you to
speak of him. (<i>after a pause--despondently</i>) My soul is
overburdened, Father.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>dryly</i>) You wish to confess?</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>surprised</i>) Confess? (<i>then in a loud,
ringing</i> <i>tone</i>) Yes, to all men! Their mouths are full
of lies against me. They say the demands I made for my share of
discovery prove my low-minded avarice. Knaves! What can they know
of my heart? Is it for myself I desire wealth? No! But as a
chosen instrument of God, Who led me to His Indies, I need the
power that wealth can give. I need it for God's glory, not my
own! (<i>more and more exaltedly</i>) I have a dream, Father!
Listen! From my earliest youth I have hated the infidel. I fought
on the ships of Genoa against their corsairs and as I saw my
city's commerce with the East cut off by their ruthlessness, I
prayed for one glorious last Crusade that would reclaim the
Mediterranean for Christendom and, most fervent prayer of all,
regain from profanation the Holy Sepulchre of our Lord Jesus!
(<i>He blesses himself. Menendez also. Then he hurries on
exultantly.</i>) And now an answer is granted! With my share of
the wealth from Indies, from Cipango and Cathay, I will fit out
an army--the Last Crusade! I have promised it to His Holiness,
the Pope--fifty thousand men, four thousand horse, with a like
force to follow after five years. I shall reconquer the Blessed
Tomb of Christ for the True Faith! And to that sacred end I
devote my life and all my wealth and power! (<i>He stands looking
up to heaven with the rapt gaze of a devotee.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>dryly</i>) Such a pious ambition does you
honor.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>unable to restrain himself calls mockingly</i>) The
Crusades are dead--and the wealth of the East is still unwon.</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>stung--indignantly</i>) Who dares--?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>proudly</i>) A noble of Spain who thinks of her
greatness while you dream of Genoa and Rome; a soldier of the
present, not the ghost of a Crusader! (<i>then with exasperated
mockery</i>) God's blood, have all our leaders become half monk?
There was a time for that when we fought the Moor, but now a new
era of world empire dawns for Spain. By living in the past you
will consecrate her future to fanaticism!</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>angrily</i>) Insolent!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>vehemently</i>) No. I respect you, Columbus--but I
have my vision, too. Spain can become the mistress of the world,
greater than ancient Rome, if she can find leaders who will weld
conquest to her, who will dare to govern with tolerance. (<i>He
laughs a bitter, mocking laugh.</i>) But what a time to speak!
Look at the men of this fleet--now when the East dawns for them!
I agree with you, Don Christopher--a weary voyage! Adventurers
lusting for loot to be had by a murder or two; nobles of Spain
dreaming greedy visions of wealth to be theirs by birthright;
monks itching for the rack to torture useful subjects of the
Crown into slaves of the Church! And for leader to have you, Don
Christopher--you who will pillage to resurrect the Crusades!
Looters of the land, one and all! There is not one who will see
it as an end to build upon! We will loot and loot and, weakened
by looting, be easy prey for stronger looters. God pity this land
until all looters perish from the earth! (<i>While he is speaking
it has grown perceptibly lighter.</i>)</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>furiously</i>) Who are you? Stand forth! You
dare not!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>jumps up to the lower level of the poop and advances
to the ladder to the Admiral's poop--proudly</i>) It is I--Juan
Ponce de Leon! Why should I not dare? Do you want men under your
command--or lackeys?</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>striving to control his rage</i>) Silence! (<i>A
wailing cry of</i> "Land Ho" <i>comes from the mainmast head.
Immediately the same cry can be heard coming over the water from
the other vessels of the fleet. Instantly all is confusion.
Everyone jumps to their feet, half awake, peering about
bewilderedly. The four Indians sense what has happened and hang
over the bulwark, staring over the seas with intense longing. A
crowd of half-dressed sailors and rabble pour up from below
decks. There is a babble of excited shouts. Columbus looks upward
to see where the lookout is pointing, then turns to the horizon
off the starboard bow. Juan leaps to the ratlines.</i>)</p>

<p>THE CROWD--Land! Land! Where? I heard the call. He shouted
land! Is it Cathay? Where is he pointing? Look where the Admiral
looks. When the sun comes--(<i>Suddenly the ship is flooded by
shafts of golden crimson light. They all cry</i>) The sun!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>pointing</i>) There! I see! In a haze of gold and
purple--Greater Spain!</p>

<p>ALL--(<i>crowd to the starboard side and to the front. The
Indians are pushed away, jostled, thrown aside contemptuously
with imprecations until they are hunched disconsolately in the
background in dumb terror and bewilderment.</i>) Where? I see!
Where? There! There! Cathay. Cipango. Is it Cathay? Where are the
golden cities? Where are the golden roofs? Is it Cipango? The
Indies! The Isles of Spice! Marco Polo's land! (<i>They all
crowd, pushing and elbowing each other, craning their necks, the
eyes of all, rabble, soldiers, nobles, priests, straining with
the same greedy longing, the lust to loot.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>exultantly</i>) Cathay or Cipango or the Isles of
Spice, what difference? It shall be Greater Spain! (<i>The crowd
cheers vociferously.</i>)</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>trying to quell the tumult</i>) Silence, I say!
(<i>fixing his eyes sternly on Juan with undisguised
hostility</i><b>--</b><i>rebukingly</i>) The earth is God's! Give
thanks to Him! Kneel, I command you! Raise the cross! (<i>The
monks raise their cross. They kneel but the nobles and soldiers
hesitate waiting for Juan as if they saw in him their true
commander.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>leaps down from the rigging, drawing his sword--with
fierce exultance</i>) This is a cross too, a soldier's cross--the
cross of Spain! (<i>He sticks his sword-point into the deck
before him. He kneels before it. All the nobles and soldiers do
likewise with a great flourish of gestures and excited shouts.
They are all kneeling with their quivering cross swords, hilts
rising above their heads.</i>)</p>

<p>COLUMBUS--(<i>from his knees--looking up to heaven
devoutly</i>) Te Deum! (<i>The monks begin to chant. All join in,
their pent-up excitement giving to the hymn a hectic, nervous
quality. Juan does not sing but stares at the land on the distant
horizon.</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="s03">SCENE THREE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Twenty years or so later--the courtyard of the
Governor's palace, Porto Rico. Flowers, shrubs, a coco-palm,
orange and banana trees. A large, handsome fountain closely
resembling that of Scene One, is at center. Two marble benches
are at front and rear of fountain. A narrow paved walk encircles
the fountain basin, with other walks leading from it to the
different entrances. Doors to the interior of the house are at
left and right. The main entrance to the courtyard, opening on
the road, is at rear center.</i></p>

<p><i>It is in the late, languid hours of a torrid afternoon. The
courtyard bakes in the heat, the fountain shimmering in the
heat-waves.</i></p>

<p><i>Juan is seated on the stone bench in front of the basin. He
is dressed in the full uniform of his authority as Governor. His
face is aged, lined, drawn. His hair and beard are gray. His
expression and attitude are full of great weariness. His eyes
stare straight before him blankly in a disillusioned dream. The
lines about his compressed lips are bitter.</i></p>

<p><i>Luis enters from the left, rear. He is dressed in the robe
of a Dominican monk. His face shows the years but it has achieved
a calm, peaceful expression as if he were at last in harmony with
himself. He comes down to Juan and puts a hand on his
shoulder.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>starts--then greets his friend with a smile</i>) Ah,
it's you, reverend Father. (<i>He accents this last
mockingly.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>good-naturedly</i>) Yes, illustrious Governor.
(<i>He sits beside Juan--with a laugh</i>) You are like a sulky
child, Juan. Come, is it not time, after five years, you forgave
me for being a Dominican?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>bitterly</i>) My friend deserting to my enemy!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>protestingly</i>) Come, come! (<i>then after a
pause, with a sigh</i>) You have always had the dream of Cathay.
What had I? What had I done with life?--an aimless, posing rake,
neither poet nor soldier, without place nor peace! I had no
meaning even to myself until God awakened me to His Holy Will.
Now I live in truth. You must renounce in order to possess.</p>

<p>JUAN--The world would be stale indeed if that were true!
(<i>after a pause--irritably</i>) I fight the battles; you monks
steal the spoils! I seek to construct; you bind my hands and
destroy!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>remonstrating</i>) You speak of Diego and his
kind.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frowning</i>) Whether you convert by clemency or he
by cruelty, the result is the same. All this baptizing of
Indians, this cramming the cross down their throats has proved a
ruinous error. It crushes their spirits and weakens their bodies.
They become burdens for Spain instead of valuable servitors.</p>

<p>LUIS--Your army crushed them first--</p>

<p>JUAN--They had to be conquered, but there I would have
stopped. (<i>then irritably</i>) God's blood, here we are arguing
about this same issue--for the thousandth time! It is too late.
Talk is useless. (<i>with a weary sigh</i>) We do what we
must--and sand covers our bodies and our deeds. (<i>with a
smile</i>) And the afternoon is too hot, besides. Tell me some
news. Will the fleet from Spain make port today?</p>

<p>LUIS--Just now I saw them rounding the point under full sail.
They should anchor inside soon. (<i>They are interrupted by the
noise of several people approaching from outside. Oviedo and
Friar Quesada, a Franciscan, enter, followed by the Indian chief,
Nano, who is guarded by two soldiers with drawn swords. Quesada
is a thin young monk with the sallow, gaunt face and burning eyes
of a fanatic. Oviedo is aged but gives no evidence of having
changed in character. Nano is a tall, powerfully built Indian of
fifty or so. Although loaded down with chains, he carries himself
erect with an air of aloof, stoical dignity. He wears a headdress
of feathers. His face and body are painted, ornaments are about
his neck. He is naked except for a breechclout and
moccasins.</i>)</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>fiercely and arrogantly</i>) I demand justice on
this dog!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>freezing--proudly</i>) Demand?</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>with ill-concealed hatred but awed by Juan's
manner</i>) Pardon my zeal in the service of God, Your
Excellency. I ask justice. (<i>then defiantly</i>) But it is not
the Church's custom to be a suppliant.</p>

<p>JUAN--So much the worse--(<i>sternly</i>) What is this
Indian's crime?</p>

<p>QUESADA--His tribe will not pay the tithes--and he himself has
dared to refuse baptism!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>coldly</i>) I'll question him. (<i>then as Quesada
hesitates, raging inwardly--sternly</i>) You may go.</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>controlling his rage, bows</i>) Yes, Your
Excellency. (<i>He goes.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>to Oviedo with a certain contempt</i>) You also have
a charge against this Indian?</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>angrily</i>) A plea for justice! These dogs will
not pay their taxes. And we who own estates cannot get them to
work except by force, which you have arbitrarily curtailed. Then
why not punish them by leasing their labor to us until their
debt's wiped out? Thus the government will be paid, and we will
have workers for our mines and fields.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>disgustedly</i>) Your brain is not inventive,
Oviedo! You are well aware that is the same blunder which failed
on Espaniola. It means slavery. It defeats its purpose. The
Indians die under the lash--and your labor dies with them.
(<i>contemptuously</i>) Do you think I am Columbus that you ask
this folly of me?</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>haughtily</i>) You refuse? (<i>He goes to the rear
where he turns--threateningly</i>) Take care, Juan! There will
come a day of reckoning--when Diego returns from Spain. (<i>He
goes out.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frowning</i>) Diego? What do you mean?</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>with a revengeful smile</i>) Nothing. Adios, Don
Juan. (<i>He goes out.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with a bitter laugh</i>) There you have it! Bah!
What use--? (<i>He suddenly seems to see Nano for the first time.
They stare at each other.</i>) I was forgetting you. Are you not
Nano, chief of the last tribe I conquered? (<i>as the Indian is
silent--imperiously</i>) Speak!</p>

<p>NANO--The devils were with you. Our villages were burned.
Women and children were killed--my wives, my children!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frowning</i>) Contrary to my command. But, again,
what use? The dead are dead. It is too late. (<i>after a
pause--with a sort of weary self-mockery</i>) Have you ever heard
of Cathay--Cipango? Do you know of vast countries to the
west--many peoples--great villages with high walls--much
gold?</p>

<p>NANO--I have heard.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>surprised--eagerly</i>) Ah! Where are they? (<i>Nano
points west.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>amusedly</i>) Where the fountain of youth of my
drunken days is located--in dreamland!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with a certain seriousness</i>) Do you know, they
say there is a similar fountain legend among these tribes.
(<i>then to Nano with a mocking smile</i>) My friend here is
growing impatient waiting for immortality in heaven and would
rather gain it here on earth--</p>

<p>LUIS--Juan!</p>

<p>JUAN--So tell him, O Mighty Chief, if there is not over
there--a fountain--a spring--in which old men bathe or drink and
become young warriors again?</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>to both their surprise</i>) The tale is told. Not
here. In my home--a land that never ends. Our priests told the
tale. I was young then. I was captured in war and brought here. I
was adopted. I have never returned.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>lost in thought</i>) So? Where is this land, your
home? (<i>Nano points as before.</i>) Where Cathay is? And the
fountain--the spring--is there?</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>after a moment's hesitation</i>) Yes. My people call
it the Spring of Life.</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>whimsically</i>) A pretty title, indeed.
(<i>sceptically</i>) But none can find it, I suppose?</p>

<p>NANO--Those the Gods love can find it.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>scornfully</i>) Aha, that old trick of
poets--evasion of facts! (<i>turning to Luis</i>) Do you remember
the Moor that night in Granada? "Only to the chosen." Here is the
echo! Bah! What jugglery! (<i>then thoughtfully</i>) But it is
strange. Where there is so much smoke, there must be a spark of
fire. The Moor traced his myth back to the East--Cathay--and now
we discover it again--still in Cathay--circling the
world--(<i>then, as if ashamed of himself for taking it so
seriously--carelessly</i>) At all events, it is added evidence
that Cathay is near. (<i>The boom of a cannon comes from the
harbor.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--The fleet has anchored. Diego will soon be here. If you
can give this Indian into my keeping I will attempt his
conversion.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>impatiently</i>) Until his case is investigated, he
must go to prison. You may see him there. (<i>to Nano,
sternly</i>) If it is proven you have encouraged rebellion
against Spain, you will be hung. Against any other charge I will
try to save you. (<i>summoning the soldiers</i>) Guard. (<i>They
salute and lead Nano out, left. Juan paces up and down in
frowning thought.</i>) Diego! Did you hear Oviedo threaten me
with him? What mischief will he bring from Spain this time, I
wonder? The cursed spider! His intriguing will destroy all my
work here--(<i>with impotent anger</i>) And the fight is
hopeless. His weapons are whispers. A man of honor stands
disarmed. (<i>intensely</i>) Would to God this fleet brought me
the King's patent to discover new lands! I would sail tomorrow
for Cathay--or for the moon!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>firmly</i>) Fight your battle here! This is your
land. You conquered it.</p>

<p>JUAN--Columbus discovered it; and I still feel his influence,
like a black fog, stifling me!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>mollifyingly</i>) He is dead. Forgive. He suffered
too much injustice to be just.</p>

<p>JUAN--How can my pride forgive? For years I held his solitary
outposts; I suffered wounds and fevers; I fought the Indians for
him while he went sailing for the Garden of Eden, the mines of
Solomon, his Bible-crazed chimeras! He knew my honor would not
permit my conspiring against him as others did. So he ignored my
services and deliberately condemned me to obscurity! Never one
mention of my name in his reports to Spain! It is only since his
downfall--(<i>breaking off</i>) But this, too, is an old story.
(<i>then with sudden exasperation</i>) Why should I not sail to
find Cathay? He failed in that--but I would succeed! I am no
visionary chasing rainbows. (<i>desperately</i>) I tell you I
loathe this place! I loathe my petty authority! By God, I could
sink all Porto Rico under the sea for one glimpse of Cathay!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>alarmed</i>) Juan!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>after a pause--ironically</i>) Well, do not fear
that I will leave your precious island. The patent will never
come--and if it did, there is a flaw--(<i>despondently, with a
great weariness</i>) It is too late. Cathay is too far. I am too
weary. I have fought small things so long that I am small. My
spirit has rusted in chains for twenty years. Now it tends to
accept them--to gain peace. (<i>with passionate yearning</i>) If
I could only feel again my old fire, my energy of heart and
mind--! If I could be once more the man who fought before
Granada--! But the fire smolders. It merely warms my will to
dream of the past. It no longer catches flame in deeds. (<i>with
a desolate smile of self-pity</i>) I begin to dread--another
failure. I am too old to find Cathay.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>appears in rear in time to hear this last. He is
dressed in a Bishop's robes. He looks his years, but his
expression of rabid fanaticism has changed to one, not less
cruel, of the crafty schemer made complacent by a successful
career, the oily intriguer</i> <i>of Church politics. He
hesitates with a suspicious, inquisitive glance from one to the
other--then advances with a forced air of joviality.</i>) What is
this I hear? Too old? Tut-tut! This is heresy, Juan. (<i>The two
turn, startled. Juan stares at him resentfully. Menendez
exchanges a cold bow of condescension with Luis, then comes to
Juan with outstretched hands, smiling oilily.</i>) Have you no
greeting for me, old friend?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>takes his hands perfunctorily--then
sarcastically</i>) Who would expect you unattended--like any
eavesdropping monk?</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>unruffled</i>) My eagerness to see you. I have
great news. I often spoke to the King about you. He now holds you
in the highest esteem, and as a proof of his favor I bring
you--(<i>then with a sly smile</i>) But, on second thought, I
should not say, I bring you. That is reserved for a worthier
hand!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>impatiently</i>) I dislike mysteries.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>provokingly</i>) I will give you this hint out
of respect for the old age you were lamenting! Prepare to welcome
youth--and a prize you have sought for all your life in the
Indies--a gift more welcome to you than wine was to Luis before
he repented! (<i>With this parting gibe, he turns away.</i>)
Pardon me if I leave you. I must make preparations--for this
event. (<i>He bows mockingly and goes off right.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>angrily</i>) Schemer! (<i>He paces up and
down.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>after pondering a moment--suddenly</i>) I have it!
It must be your patent to explore! He has obtained it from the
King--because he wishes to get rid of you here! You stand in his
way--your policy of clemency. He wants to be dictator to
introduce torture and slavery! Yet he is afraid to fight you
openly, so what craftier scheme than to send you away contented,
grateful for a gift, bribed without knowing it?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>resentfully</i>) Then I will fool the fox! There is
no compulsion in such a patent. (<i>then confused</i>) But--it
would be my highest hope come true--too late! Too late! I am too
old. (<i>with an attempt at a railing tone</i>) God's blood, I
need to find Cathay--if your Fountain of Youth is there!</p>

<p>LUIS--I hear a crowd coming. I must go. It adds to their
spleen to find us together. (<i>He presses Juan's hand.</i>)
Whatever comes, be firm, old friend. (<i>He goes out left. The
murmur of</i> <i>the crowd increases. Juan sinks on the bench
before the fountain, oblivious to it, lost in gloomy thought.
Beatriz de Cordova appears, attended by her duenna and a crowd of
richly dressed nobles. She is a beautiful young girl of eighteen
or so, the personification of youthful vitality, charm and grace.
The nobles point out Juan to her. She dismisses them, motioning
for them to be quiet--then comes in and approaches Juan, keeping
the fountain between them. She holds a sealed document in her
hand. Finally she calls in a trembling, eager voice</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--Don Juan! (<i>Juan whirls on his bench and stares
through the fountain at her. He utters a stunned exclamation as
if he saw a ghost. His eyes are held fascinated by her beauty.
Then suddenly she laughs--a gay, liquid, clear note--and coming
quickly around confronts him.</i>) It is I, Don Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>stares at her still fascinated--then, reminded,
springs to his feet and bows low with his old mocking
gallantry</i>) Pardon! I am bewitched! I thought you were the
spirit of the fountain. (<i>then more mockingly</i>) Beautiful
lady, you do me unmerited honor!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>hurt and confused by his tone</i>) You don't know
me? Why, I'm Beatriz. (<i>as he bows but shows no
recognition</i>) Has Bishop Menendez not told you--?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>suspiciously</i>) Nothing of you, my lady.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--I am Beatriz de Cordova--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>guessing--amazed, stares at her--a pause,
slowly</i>) Maria's child!--you!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>letting it all pour forth regardless</i>) She
died a year ago--and--I am your ward now. It was her last wish.
My father was dead. There was no near relative whom she would
trust. I asked the King to send me here to you. He bade me wait
until the Bishop could escort me. He made me the bearer of this
gift for you--your dearest wish, he said. (<i>She gives him the
document.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>unrolls it--a pause as he stares at it dully, then
bitterly</i>) The patent--to find Cathay!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--Yes! And you can find it where the others failed, I
know! You were my dear mother's ideal of Spanish chivalry, of a
true knight of the Cross! That was her prophecy, that you would
be the first to reach Cathay!</p>

<p>JUAN--She spoke of the man she knew. (<i>staring at her</i>
<i>fascinatedly--eagerly</i>) She sends me you--and you are
youth! Is it in mockery?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>suddenly</i>) Oh, Don Juan, I recall something
she said I must remember when we should meet. "Bring him
tenderness," she said. "That will repay the debt I owe him for
saving me for you." She said these words were secrets to tell you
alone. What did she mean, Don Juan?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>deeply moved</i>) Tenderness? Do you bring me that,
Beatriz? (<i>then as if recalling himself</i>) No, do not--for it
means weakness. Bring me the past instead. Give me back--the man
your mother knew.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>who has been scrutinizing him without paying
attention to his words</i>) You are older than I dreamed, Don
Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>wounded--with harsh violence</i>) No tenderness
there! Youth! A cuirass of shining steel! A glittering sword!
Laughter above the battle! (<i>Then seeing her look of frightened
astonishment at his wild words, he controls himself and adds with
a melancholy bitterness</i>) It was so long ago, Beatriz--that
night in Granada--a dimly-remembered dream--(<i>then with a
sudden return of his mockingly gallant manner</i>) Forgive me. I
have become a savage lost to manners. (<i>He kneels and kisses
her hand with all his old-time gallantry.</i>) Welcome, dear
ward, to Porto Rico! (<i>She looks down at his bowed head,
blushing with pleasure and na&iuml;ve embarrassment, as</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s04">SCENE FOUR</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Three months later--Menendez' official study in the
palace--a large, high-ceilinged, bare room with a heavy table at
center. The color scheme is dark and gloomy, the atmosphere that
of a rigid, narrow ecclesiasticism. In one corner is an altar
with high candles burning before it. Heavy hangings shut out the
light from the lofty, arched windows. An enormous crucifix hangs
on the wall in rear. The room is like an exaggerated monk's cell,
but it possesses a somber power over the imagination by the force
of its concentration. There is a main entrance at rear, center,
and a smaller side door at left, hidden by curtains.</i></p>

<p><i>It is early evening. Menendez is seated at the table. He is
frowningly impatient, listening and waiting for someone. There is
the sound of approaching footsteps. Menendez turns eagerly in his
chair. Quesada enters through the hangings on the left. His face
is ominous and set. He wears a sword and pistols over his robe
which is tucked up over high riding boots and spurs. He is
covered with dust, and has evidently been riding hard. He bows
respectfully to Menendez.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>MENENDEZ--I had begun to think you would never come. (<i>then
with anxiety</i>) What news?</p>

<p>QUESADA--The meeting is being held. They have gathered in the
fort outside the town.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--Good! It is moving according to my plan, then.</p>

<p>QUESADA--They all agree that Don Juan must resign his
patent.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--Unless he sails to find Cathay at once?</p>

<p>QUESADA--Yes. They are all mad for the gold (<i>with a
sneer</i>) over there, the report of which I have had rumored
about, as you directed.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--Good. Then we shall be rid of Juan and all the
discontented spirits on the island at one stroke!</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>excitedly</i>) But they also demand that first
the Indian, Nano, must be burned at the stake. They believe he
has bewitched the Governor. They know of Don Juan's secret
interviews with him.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>angrily</i>) Who told them?</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>after a moment's hesitation--defiantly</i>) I
did.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>angrily</i>) Fool!</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>alarmed--humbly</i>) But the dog still refuses
baptism.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>sternly</i>) Is this a time to consider one
Indian? Idiot! You know as well as I that my intention has been
to attack Juan on one issue, and only one--his failure to sail
for Cathay now that he has the King's patent. What have all the
Nanos, hung or unhung, to do with that?</p>

<p>QUESADA--Much! If Don Juan were not bewitched by Nano's
spells, he would have sailed long since.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--And you told the rabble that? God pardon you! Was it
any part of my orders that you should play upon the mob's lust
for blood? I have worked for a peaceable revolt that would awaken
Juan to his weakness and shame him into leaving. You have dared
to evoke a madness which might easily sweep away all recognized
authority. Quick! What was the rabble's mood when you left?
(<i>Quesada avoids his eyes. Menendez pounds the table.</i>)
Answer me!</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>evasively</i>) They had been drinking--</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>furiously, a note of alarm creeping in</i>)
Ah!</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>now thoroughly cowed</i>) They were clamoring to
march on the palace. Don Oviedo was trying to restrain them--</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>fiercely--with bitter scorn</i>) You cursed
blunderer! No, I am the dolt for having trusted you!</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>kneeling--cowed</i>) Forgive me, Your Grace!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--Your action was treachery to me! And I shall punish
you! When this expedition sails for that golden fable, Cathay,
you shall go with it. Then blunder all you like! (<i>He rises and
strides to the window at rear.</i>)</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>humbly</i>) I humbly accept my penance.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>bitterly</i>) Behold the first fruits of your
excessive piety! (<i>He points.</i>) The southern horizon is
aflame!</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>rising</i>) They must have set fire to the Indian
villages.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--Blood and fire! Your merry dance begins well! (<i>He
lets the curtains fall back.</i>) Only Juan can control them
now--if he would only promise them to sail at once--but no, he is
too proud. He will fight armed rebellion to the last--and we will
all go down in the same ruin!</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>scornfully</i>) He is not the man he was--since
Nano bewitched him.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>disgustedly</i>) Bah! You fool! (<i>then
intently</i>) Yet there is truth in what you say. He has grown
weak--between Luis' influence and the girl's
meddling--(<i>abruptly</i>) Come! There is still a chance. Summon
Don Juan to me at once! (<i>this last in a shout of
impatience</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>from outside, rear, mockingly</i>) There is no need
for messengers. (<i>He enters. In the three months he has aged
greatly. His hair and beard have grown perceptibly white. Beneath
the bitter, mocking mask there is an expression of deep,</i>
<i>hidden conflict and suffering on his face as if he were at war
with himself.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>startled, afraid of what Juan may have
overheard</i>) You heard--?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>scornfully</i>) Only what you shouted. Am I a monk
to listen at keyholes? (<i>this with a glance at Quesada</i>) But
I know your intrigues. This meeting of yapping curs--you see, I
have heard the rumor--you would have me sail at their bidding,
and thus you would be free to rule this island in God's Holy
Name! Is it not so?</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>controlling his anger</i>) You have lost your
senses. You will not realize that things have reached a crisis!
The government has slipped through your fingers while you played
at being a loving father--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>stung--fiercely</i>) It's a lie! (<i>controlling
himself</i>) I tell you again, Diego, I will sail at my pleasure,
not yours.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>persuasively</i>) You have kept repeating
that--and meanwhile your apathy has ruined us. Your soldiers and
sailors are in open mutiny. The mob has risen. (<i>urgently</i>)
Juan, do you want rebellion to overwhelm us? You promised them
Cathay--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>proudly</i>) It was you who promised them in my
name, you mean, to make certain you would be rid of me!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>tauntingly--noting Juan's reactions
craftily</i>) I promised because I thought you were still Juan
Ponce de Leon. But you are not. You have become merely a slave to
a girl's sentimental whims! You are too feeble to govern here and
too weak for Cathay. (<i>Juan's hand goes to his sword. Menendez
continues cuttingly.</i>) Then for the sake of Spain, resign your
office and surrender your patent for discovery to someone with
the youth and courage to dare!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>infuriated, half drawing his sword</i>) Take care,
Diego! Your cloth cannot condone such insults!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>in a softened, oily tone</i>) Forgive me, Juan.
I insult you for your own sake! Push on to your greatest victory!
Do not wait here in a stupor for inglorious defeat!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>shaken</i>) I shall sail--but first I must
know--know for a certainty, beyond all doubt--exactly
where--(<i>He stops abruptly</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>inquisitively</i>) What?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>suspiciously</i>) Nothing.</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>who has been listening with feverish
interest--points to Juan accusingly</i>) He has gone to Nano
every day. Look at his eyes! He is bewitched! (<i>Juan starts
guiltily but tries to ignore him contemptuously</i>.)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--Be still, Quesada! (<i>He looks at Juan.</i>) These
interviews <i>are</i> mysterious, Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>quickly--half turning away and averting his
eyes--with forced carelessness</i>) I need accurate information
for my voyage that only Nano can give me. That is why I have
delayed.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>looking at him sharply</i>) So? I had thought it
might be affection for Beatriz that held you.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>vehemently</i>) No!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>keenly</i>) Why are you so vehement? It would be
natural enough. You have lived alone. To find a daughter in your
declining years--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>pale with rage and agony</i>) Daughter? How could
she look upon me--?</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>soothingly but with a taunting intent</i>) She
used to regard you as her hero, her great commander. She must
wonder now at this old man's weakness in you.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frenziedly</i>) Do you dare taunt me in her name? I
<i>will</i> sail, I say! I will sail the very first day after I
discover--(<i>then distractedly, shaken</i>) Enough, Diego! I
shall do what I wish and when it pleases me! (<i>He rushes out
rear as if furies were hounding him. Menendez looks after him, a
sneering smile of satisfaction gradually coming over his face as
if something were proven to him.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>half to himself, half to Quesada</i>) I should
have guessed it before. Yet, who would have thought--He is
bewitched, certainly.</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>eagerly</i>) Yes!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>dryly</i>) But you are blaming the wrong witch.
The guilty one is sinless. (<i>Quesada puzzles over this paradox
with open eyes. Menendez ponders for a moment, then he turns to
Quesada</i>.) Bring the Lady Beatriz.</p>

<p>QUESADA--Yes, Your Grace. (<i>He bows and hurries out, left.
Menendez sits thoughtfully, evidently planning out his campaign.
A moment later Beatriz enters. She bows respectfully.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>reservedly</i>) You wish to see me, Your
Grace?</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>nods and motions her to a chair. He scrutinizes
her face carefully for a moment, then begins in a playful,
ironical tone.</i>) Beauty did not leave a stone on stone of
ancient Troy. Are you another Helen, Beatriz?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>confused</i>) I--don't understand.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>coldly and brusquely</i>) Not understand that
rebellion is seething in Porto Rico?--a rebellion that will deal
destruction to us all!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>bewildered</i>) Rebellion? (<i>then
spiritedly</i>) Who would dare rebel against Don Juan?</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>belittlingly</i>) Juan is powerless. His own
soldiers have taken the lead against him. He is facing ruin! Do
you understand? I wish I had words of fire to brand it on your
brain! For I tell you on my conscience, as God's minister, you
are the one responsible!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>stunned</i>) I? I? You are jesting! (<i>then with
haughty resentment</i>) I harm Don Juan, who is my second
father!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>seeming to grow more icy under her anger</i>)
Who has done most in influencing him to softness and lax
discipline--</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>indignantly</i>) You mean because I have pitied
the suffering of the Indians--?</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>dryly</i>) Let us judge your pity by its
results. These heathen no longer fear. They defy our Holy Faith.
They sneer at baptism. These Indians shirk their labor. And
because Don Juan spends his time with you, he has forgotten not
only his duty to govern but his oath to seek Cathay. The soldiers
and sailors have waited too long in idleness. Now they revere him
no longer as a daring general who will lead them to glory but
despise him for a dissembler, delaying because he has lost the
courage for action! And so they have conspired. Those are the
facts. Will you deny your influence is deep at the root of them?
(<i>Beatriz is too overwhelmed by the ruthlessness of his attack
to reply. He pushes his advantage.</i>) And can you deny that a
great change has come over Don Juan since your arrival? You
cannot have helped but notice this!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--He has seemed--to become despondent at times.</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>vehemently</i>) Spiritless! Infirm! His thoughts
wander like a senile old man's! I believe his mind is failing
him!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>horrified</i>) No! No!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--You must face the truth! (<i>sternly</i>) When you
take a life's ambition from a man like Juan, the man withers
away. You have made him forget Cathay. Why? Why have you not
urged him to go--for his own sake? When you brought out the
patent, you dreamed of him as he dreams of himself--a conqueror
and hero!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>hesitatingly</i>) Father Luis told me we must
keep him here--or else his good work would be undone--</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--This uprising will undo it in an hour! (<i>then
soothingly</i>) Father Luis is a good man--but blind. You are a
girl--and inexperienced--Come. (<i>He pauses, watching her
keenly, then takes her hand, and leading her to the window, pulls
back the curtain.</i>) Look!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>with a shudder of horror</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--Now do you believe in the rebellion--in Juan's
danger?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>horrified</i>) Fire!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--And murder! In the Indian villages. See what your
pity for them has done! And it will not stop there. That is only
the first spark of revolution. They'll march here!
(<i>impressively</i>) Beatriz, you can save Don Juan. He loves
you--as his daughter. Urge him to sail at once! Rouse the hero in
him! Give him back his sanity! He is my old friend. I implore you
for his sake, Beatriz!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>bewilderedly</i>) Yes--yes--but give me time to
think--to pray for guidance--(<i>She kneels before the
altar.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>impatiently</i>) There is no time! (<i>There is
a noise of hurrying steps and Oviedo enters. He is booted,
spurred, covered with dust, his face betraying anxiety and
alarm.</i>)</p>

<p>OVIEDO--(<i>without stopping to see who is there, bursts
forth</i>) Diego! I tried to check them, but they have gone mad!
They are marching on the town! Juan will be lost!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>to Beatriz who has turned around in terror</i>)
You hear!</p>

<p>OVIEDO--The time has come to abandon that sick fool! We must
openly lead this rebellion!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>springs to her feet and faces him--her eyes
flashing</i>) Coward! (<i>He falls back, his hand on his sword,
glaring at her.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>urgently</i>) Go, Beatriz! (<i>She passes Oviedo
with a scathing glance, and goes out rear. Menendez turns to
Oviedo with an ironical but worried smile.</i>)</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--If she will but speak to Juan as she did to you, we
may still win, my friend!</p>

<h1><a name="s05">SCENE FIVE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Nano's dungeon--a circular cavern, hollowed out by
Nature and cut out by man in the solid rock under the Government
house. The enclosed space is narrow but lofty, cylindrical in
form. A cut-in flight of steps leads from the floor in rear to a
trapdoor above. The high wall glistens with moisture. A small
bench is at right. A lantern stands on one of the lower steps. In
the middle of the floor stands a soldier, thick-set,
brutal-looking, his sleeves rolled up over his muscular arms. He
is blowing with a bellows on a charcoal brazier, glowing red-hot,
in which are thrust several irons. On the wall in the rear, his
toes barely touching the floor, Nano hangs with his arms
outstretched over his head, the wrists bound by chains to iron
sockets in the rock. His head hangs on one side as if he were in
a state of semi-consciousness. His body is thin and
wasted.</i></p>

<p><i>The trap-door is opened and a circular patch of gray light
falls on the stairs. This is obscured as someone descends. It is
Juan. He shuts the trap-door behind him and comes down. He stops
when he is opposite Nano's head, and, leaning over, stares at the
savage's face. The latter opens his eyes. His head stiffens
proudly erect on his shoulders. He and Juan stare into each
other's eyes. Juan drops his guiltily, turns away and descends to
the floor, where the soldier is standing at attention.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>harshly</i>) Has he spoken?</p>

<p>SOLDIER--Not one word, sir.</p>

<p>JUAN--Then you have not obeyed--</p>

<p>SOLDIER--(<i>indicates the irons in the fire</i>) I have tried
every trick I know--but he's made of iron.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>looks up at Nano with intense hatred</i>) Dog!
(<i>Then he turns to the soldier.</i>) Go and keep guard
above.</p>

<p>SOLDIER--Yes, sir. (<i>He bends down to pick up the
brazier.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>harshly</i>) No.</p>

<p>SOLDIER--(<i>with a glance at him--understandingly</i>) Yes,
sir. (<i>He goes up the stairs, opens the trap-door and
disappears, letting it fall shut behind him. Juan sinks on the
stone bench at right and stares up at Nano, who looks back at him
with unflinching defiance. A pause.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>his eyes now fixed dully on the floor--half-aloud to
himself</i>) Diego did not lie. The storm is gathering. (<i>with
bitter hopelessness</i>) What matter? I could pray that it might
be a deluge annihilating mankind--but for Beatriz. (<i>He groans,
then raises his eyes again to Nano.</i>) Why do you look at me? I
can never read your eyes. They see in another world. What are
you? Flesh, but not our flesh. Earth. I come after--or
before--but lost, blind in a world where my eyes deflect on
surfaces. What values give you your loan of life? Answer! I must
know the terms in which to make appeal! (<i>The savage is silent,
motionless. A pause. Then Juan, as if suddenly reminded, jumps to
his feet in a frenzy of impatience.</i>) Answer me, dog! I must
find the will to act--or be dishonored!</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>solemnly--in a faint voice</i>) The Gods are
angry.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with wild joy</i>) You speak! At last! Nano, why
have you kept dumb while I implored--?</p>

<p>NANO--The Gods have stopped your ears.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>going on obsessed, regardless</i>) Juan Ponce de
Leon--to torture a helpless captive! Why did you bring me to such
shame? Why would you not answer my question?</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>with contempt</i>) My tongue grew weary. For a moon
I answered every day.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>fiercely</i>) But you lied! Tell me the truth now!
Where is the fountain?</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>indifferently, shutting his eyes</i>) Only the Gods
know.</p>

<p>JUAN--The same lie! You told me at first that men of your
former tribe knew! You must know! This is your revenge--for the
death of your wives and children! Must I swear to you again they
were killed in spite of my strict orders? Come! Forget them! I
will give you your choice of all your women on the island--your
freedom--I will petition the King to honor you--give you back
your lands--anything if you will answer me! (<i>Nano remains
silent. Juan utters a furious cry and, rushing to the brazier,
takes a red-hot coal with the tongs and holds it before the
Indian's eyes.</i>) Dog! I will burn that scorn from your eyes!
(<i>The Indian stares at the hot iron immovably. Juan lets it
fall to the floor with a desperate groan of misery.</i>) Pardon!
Forgiveness in Christ's name! It is you who torture me! Nano, I
burn to hell! I love! (<i>He suddenly stops, chilled to despair
by the implacable isolation in the savage's face. He throws
himself down on the bench in an apathy. Finally he slowly draws
his sword and speaks in a dead voice.</i>) Either you speak or
you die. I swear it.</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>with aloof contempt</i>) What is death?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>dully</i>) I will die, too. Perhaps in the grave
there is oblivion and peace. (<i>after a pause</i>) You are a
fool, Nano. If you would help me I could make you pilot of the
fleet to guide us to your land. The fountain once found, you
would be free. No harm should come to your people. Do you never
long for your old home?</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>who has been listening with quickened interest</i>)
Home? To the land of flowers. My home of many warriors. (<i>after
a pause</i>) You will let me guide the great winged canoes--to my
home?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>eagerly</i>) Yes. (<i>in great suspense</i>) Will
you help me? Tell me! (<i>He has sprung to his feet.</i>)</p>

<p>NANO--Only the Gods--(<i>He checks himself abruptly.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>frenziedly</i>) Ah! (<i>He raises his sword as if to
run the savage through?</i>)</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>looking into Juan's eyes without noticing the
threat</i>) The tongues of the white devils are false. How can I
trust your word?</p>

<p>JUAN--I take my sacred oath! (<i>He raises his hand.</i>)</p>

<p>NANO--Your God is a God of lies.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>wildly</i>) By your God then--since mine has
forsaken me!</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>lifts his head and murmurs some supplication, as
if</i> <i>begging forgiveness--then looks at Juan with savage
triumph</i>) I will guide you--but remember the way is long!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>triumphantly</i>) At last! What does it matter how
long or difficult! (<i>raising his arms</i>) Ah, God's blood, I
already feel new life, the will to live! I can conquer now! (<i>A
pounding of a sword-butt on the trap-door. Then it is flung
open.</i>)</p>

<p>SOLDIER--Pardon, Excellency--</p>

<p>BEATRIZ' VOICE--(<i>calls down</i>) Don Juan! Don Juan!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>exultantly</i>) Her voice! A happy omen! (<i>He
hurries up the stairs.</i>)</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>again lifting his eyes to heaven--with religious
fervor</i>) Great Spirit, forgive my lie. His blood shall
atone!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Same as Scene Three--Courtyard of the Governor's
House--a stifling twilight. The sky is darkening with
clouds.</i></p>

<p><i>Beatriz' voice--from the left--calls down as at the end of
preceding scene.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>BEATRIZ--Don Juan! Don Juan! (<i>His voice is heard,</i>
"Beatriz." <i>She enters, pale and agitated, runs to rear and
looks for signs of the insurrection--then hurries back just in
time to meet Juan, who enters, left. He is in a tense state of
hectic excitement, his face ghastly pale, his obsessed eyes
burning feverishly, his drawn sword still in his hand. She starts
back from him, frightened by his appearance.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>in a strained, high-pitched tone</i>) Was it the
fountain called--or you, Beatriz? You, for you are the fountain!
(<i>He takes her hand impetuously and kisses it.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>flurriedly</i>) I came to warn you--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with a sharp glance</i>) Warn? Then you have seen
Diego? Bah! (<i>He makes a gesture of contempt with his sword as
if brushing all revolutions aside.</i>) When the hour comes, I
shall be strong. The will breathes in me again. Forget all else,
Beatriz. Give me your thoughts! Have you been happy here with
me?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>not knowing what to say or do</i>) Yes--yes.
(<i>trying to return to her mission</i>) But--</p>

<p>JUAN--You came as a benediction--that cursed me.
(<i>abruptly</i>) Have you not noticed how much older I have
grown?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>convinced he is out of his head--resolved to
humor him--frightened but pityingly</i>) You can become young
again.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>exultantly</i>) I will! (<i>then mysteriously</i>)
This is a strange world with many wonders still undiscovered.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>seeing a chance to bring in her
point--quickly</i>) Then discover them. The search will make you
young.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>deeply and superstitiously impressed</i>) From your
own lips! It is another blessed augury! (<i>eagerly</i>) But
pretend I am young. What then?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--Why then you would be happy.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>intensely</i>) You promise--? Have you never
loved?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>bewildered</i>) Loved?</p>

<p>JUAN--Since you speak of happiness.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--I loved my mother--my father--I love you, Don
Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>avidly</i>) Ah, say that again! Those words are
blood to my heart!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>earnestly</i>) I love you as I loved my
father--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>brusquely--wounded to the quick</i>) Has love never
stolen into your dreams? You are no nun. Come, tell me the image
of the one you dream of as a lover.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>resolved to pass this off jestingly</i>) It is a
great secret. You insist? Well then, it is your double--(<i>Juan
utters a cry of joy, bending toward her. She adds hastily</i>)
You as my mother described you in the wars before Granada.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>bitterly</i>) When I had youth. But I loved only
glory then. Did she not tell you that?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--Why then--that is why she said, bring him
tenderness.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>somberly</i>) You have fulfilled her wish--or was it
her revenge? (<i>then abruptly</i>) And what if I should myself
become that double?--the knight of Granada with your gift of
tenderness--what then?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>frightened by his strangeness</i>) Ah, now, you
are jesting, Don Juan. (<i>She forces a laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>passionately</i>) No, Beatriz! (<i>She instinctively
shrinks away from him. He calms himself.</i>) No more now. I fear
your laughter. First let the consummation--Then you will not
laugh. You--(<i>trying to read her mystified eyes--miserably
uncertain</i>) What will you do?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>controlling her timidity--softly persuasive</i>)
You are ill, Don Juan. Will you listen to my cure for you?</p>

<p>JUAN--Yes.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>with energy</i>) Sail and find Cathay!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with a start, tormentedly</i>) You, too, condemn me!
But I swear to you I have longed to go! I have hated my own
cowardice! I have played the traitor to every dream, every great
hope--But, Beatriz, when I go, I will leave my life behind with
you. So--until I knew--I was afraid of losing what I
have--(<i>then with a quick change to something approaching
triumphant decision</i>) But that is past! My will has risen from
the dead. It is decreed by your own lips. I shall sail at
once!</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--Oh, I am glad!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>sadly</i>) Glad I am leaving you?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--No, I shall be sad and lonely. It is for your own
welfare--</p>

<p>JUAN--But promise me one boon--</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>eagerly</i>) Anything!</p>

<p>JUAN--Promise you will not marry until I return--or you hear I
am dead?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>confused</i>) I have never even thought of
marrying.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>in deadly earnest in spite of his pitiful pretense
at a joking tone</i>) Until I present my double to you--?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>relieved and laughing easily</i>) Why, I might
change my mind then, Don Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--Will you seal that pledge with a kiss? (<i>He forces a
smile to conceal his longing.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>uncertainly--forcing a laugh</i>) Yes, Don Juan.
(<i>She lifts her face to him. He starts to kiss her on the lips
but something in her face stops him and he ends by kissing her
reverentially on the forehead--forcing a smile</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--There--upon your forehead--for remembrance. The
other--for tenderness--is still a promise of my dream. (<i>There
is a sound of hurrying step and Juan moves away from Beatriz
guiltily. Luis enters from the rear. His face is agitated, full
of alarm and anxiety.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>greeting him eagerly, glad of the
interruption</i>) Father Luis.</p>

<p>LUIS--Juan! I bring you terrible news. (<i>He sees Juan's
drawn sword.</i>) Ah, you know! It is time you drew your
sword.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>scornfully</i>) You mean the scum rises? When I tell
them the fleet sails tomorrow--</p>

<p>LUIS--Will you give them Nano to burn at the stake? That is
their first demand. (<i>Beatriz gives a horrified cry.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>stunned--unbelievingly</i>) Surrender Nano? No, it
is impossible. You have heard rumors--</p>

<p>LUIS--Quesada has roused their cruelty to frenzy. (<i>He
points to where a red glow is mounting up in the sky.</i>) See!
They are burning the Indian quarter. May God have mercy!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>in a rage</i>) Kill Nano? The curs! I shall order a
company of my guard--</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>looking at him pityingly</i>) Your guard is leading
the mob! (<i>reproachfully</i>) Juan, Juan, why have you lived in
a dream! I warned you time after time. If you had been governor
in anything but name--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>sinking on the bench--stupidly</i>) Call the guard.
I must order them to disperse.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>pityingly</i>) His mind is sick--</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>rather peremptorily</i>) Will you leave us,
Beatriz?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>obediently</i>) Yes, Father. (<i>then
excitedly</i>) I must see Bishop Menendez--(<i>She hurries out,
right.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>comes and slaps Juan on the back--sternly</i>) Juan!
Awake, in God's name!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>startled to action, springs to his feet</i>) I shall
protect his life with my own!</p>

<p>LUIS--In order to torture him yourself?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>vehemently but guiltily</i>) A lie!
(<i>suspicious--resentfully</i>) Have you seen him? I gave
orders--</p>

<p>LUIS--It is weeks since I was permitted to see him; and you
have avoided meeting me. Why?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>harshly</i>) I have no patience with your
converting. I need Nano as he is.</p>

<p>LUIS--Because you prefer his heathen myths--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>controlling an outburst of rage</i>) Myths? Why
myths? Cathay is there. (<i>He points.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--I was not speaking of Cathay. You are sailing tomorrow?
Does this mean you have finally wrung from this poor Indian's
agonies a faith in magic fountains--?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>losing control of himself--raging</i>) Fool! You are
like those dullards who, when Columbus said the earth was round,
brayed at him for blaspheming! Listen to me! I do not believe
Nano; I believe in Nature. Nature is part of God. She can perform
miracles. Since this land was discovered have we not found
wonders undreamed of before? The points in Nano's story hold true
to the facts we know. His home is a beautiful mainland--"A land
of flowers," in his own words. Is not Cathay also known as the
"Flowery Land"? There are great walled cities with roofs of gold
inland to the West. Is not that Marco Polo's land beyond all
doubt? And the fountain is in Cathay. All the evidence from
around the world proves that! And I shall find it!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>pityingly</i>) But this evidence is merely fable,
legend, the dreams of poets!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>furiously</i>) Have praying and fasting made you an
imbecile? What evidence had Columbus? And you--you believe Christ
lived and died. Well, have you talked with men who saw Him in the
manger, or on the cross?</p>

<p>LUIS--Juan, this is blasphemy!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with bitter despair</i>) Then let it be! I have
prayed to Him in vain.</p>

<p>LUIS--Juan!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with all the power of his will in the words</i>) Let
me be damned forever if Nature will only grant me youth upon this
earth again!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>horrified</i>) Juan! You defy your God!</p>

<p>JUAN--There is no God but Love--no heaven but youth!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>looks at his tortured face intently--suddenly
realizes--in a tone of great pity</i>) So that is it--I have been
blind. I thought your love saw in her--a child, a daughter!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>intensely</i>) A child--yes--for a time--but one
morning standing by the fountain she was a woman. More than a
woman! She was the Spirit of Youth, Hope, Ambition, Power to
dream and dare! She was all that I had lost. She was Love and the
Beauty of Love! So I loved her, loved her with all the intensity
of Youth's first love--when youth was dead! Oh, it was monstrous
folly, I admit. I called myself a senile fool! I suffered with
the damned. I lived in hell without the recompense of being dead!
And I loved her more--and more! (<i>His head sinks down on his
hands. A great sob racks his whole body.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>overcome by compassion, his voice trembling</i>) Old
friend--God in His Mercy have pity on you! (<i>He is interrupted
by the hurried entrance of Beatriz from the right.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>indignantly</i>) Bishop Menendez says he can do
nothing--that you must give Nano up! (<i>The angry tumult of a
mob marching is heard from the distance. Frightenedly</i>)
Listen! Oh, Don Juan, you will save him, will you not?</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>starting up--in a voice in which rage and
apprehension are blended</i>) I must! (<i>He listens to the
rising murmur of the mob. As he does so his whole body stiffens
into defiant determination. He becomes in an instant the
commander again.</i>) Cowardly rabble! (<i>He springs to the
entrance on the left and shouts to the soldier on guard</i>)
Bring Nano! (<i>He comes back to where Beatriz and Luis are
standing and looks around the courtyard as if measuring his
position.</i>) I shall face them here. Take Beatriz away,
Luis.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--I wish to stay with you!</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--(<i>enters from the right</i>) Juan! (<i>seeing his
drawn sword--apprehensively</i>) What? You will defy them? Then
you are lost! Yield to them, I advise you. Give Nano to justice.
(<i>While he is speaking Nano is half carried in by the soldiers.
He is limp and exhausted.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with wild scorn</i>) Ah, High Priest! Deliver him
up, eh?</p>

<p>MENENDEZ--Juan! You are impious! (<i>angrily</i>) It is
sacrilege--to compare this Indian dog--you mock our Blessed
Savior! You are cursed--I wash my hands--His will be done! (<i>He
turns and strides back into the house, right.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>at a nearer roar from the mob</i>) Juan! Escape!
There is still time--</p>

<p>JUAN--Run from jackals! Is my honor dead?</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>as a smashing battering sounds from outside</i>)
They are at the outer gate! Come, Beatriz, in God's name! (<i>She
struggles but he succeeds in getting her as far as the entrance,
right. A last crashing smash is heard as the outer gate gives
way. A moment later the advance guard of the mob pour in--all of
the lower rabble, these. Some wave torches above their heads. All
are armed with pikes, knives, and various crude weapons that they
have picked up or stolen.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>in a roar of command</i>) Back! (<i>They hesitate
for a moment. Then they see Nano and with yells of fury rush for
him around the fountain. Juan springs to meet them. With quick
thrusts and cuts of his sword he kills or wounds four of the
foremost, who drop to the ground. The rest fall back frightened
and awed for the moment. In this lull the remainder of the mob
pour in from the rear, crowding and jostling each other. They are
a nondescript crowd, ranging from nobles, richly dressed,
soldiers, sailors, to the riff-raff of the criminal element in
bright-colored rags. There are a number of monks among them,
Franciscans who urge them on, a few Dominicans who plead for
restraint.</i>)</p>

<p>THE MOB--Don Juan! It's the Governor--push back there!--To the
flames with the Indian dog! Seize him! Stand aside, Don Juan!
Heretic! He's bewitched! The dog refused baptism! Torture!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>sternly</i>) I will kill the man who touches this
Indian! (<i>He walks up and down before them, his sword ready to
thrust, looking from eye to eye--scathingly</i>) Scoundrels!
Where is your valor now? Prick up your courage!
(<i>mockingly</i>) Come! Who wishes to die?</p>

<p>A NOBLE--We demand justice! (<i>Yells of approval from the
crowd. They push in closer. Juan levels his sword at the breast
of the nearest who springs back with a frightened cry. The mob
sways and surges, close packed and indecisive, cowed by Juan's
eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>suddenly pushing his way to the front of the
crowd--pointing at Nano, frantically</i>) Give him up! You are
bewitched! (<i>The mob are again aroused. There are cries</i> of
"To the stake! Torture!" <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--No! (<i>Yells of rage. The mob surges forward. Juan
raises his sword.</i>) I will kill the first one who--(<i>They
recoil again, all but Quesada. With his free hand Juan sweeps him
to</i> <i>one side contemptuously--then fiercely threatening the
crowd</i>) Will you rebel against the Governor of your King? Then
you are traitors to Spain! And, by God's blood, I will hang one
of you on every tree! (<i>The crowd gives way by inches,
sullenly, their yells reduced for the moment to a rebellious
muttering:</i> "The King will remove you! Hang the Indians! Hang
them! Hang Nano!" <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>A SOLDIER--We mean no harm to you, Don Juan. Keep your word to
us. Order the fleet to sail. (<i>a yell of acclamation from the
soldiers and sailors</i>)</p>

<p>QUESADA--And give over that dog! The Inquisition shall know
you protect infidels!</p>

<p>JUAN--I am Spain's soldier, not the Inquisition's! Soldiers
and sailors! I tell you it is in Spain's service this Indian's
life is spared. The fleet sails tomorrow--and we need Nano to
pilot our voyage! (<i>A tumult from the bewildered crowd. Shouts
of various nature:</i> "The fleet sails! Tomorrow! Hurrah! He
jokes! He mocks us! Spare him? No luck with a heathen on board!
What does he mean? Guide us? No! The curse of the Church!" <i>But
the mob is puzzled, blundering, and Juan continues with a sort of
condescension as if he were speaking to children.</i>) Silence!
Since you are so stupid, I must explain. This Nano was born on
the mainland--Cathay!--our goal, do you understand?--and I have
put off sailing while I questioned him. We must have his
knowledge. He must be our pilot. (<i>with a fierce glance at Nano
as if to let his threat strike home</i>) And if he fails in his
promise to me, I will gladly give him to you for punishment.</p>

<p>QUESADA--(<i>furiously</i>) You say this to save him!</p>

<p>JUAN--Soldiers, sailors, I appeal to you! Can this mad monk
lead you to conquest? You must decide between us. (<i>The crowd
are all turning his way, becoming greedily enthusiastic. Juan
sees the psychological moment to play a trump card.</i>) But to
convince you finally, listen to Nano. Speak, Nano! Tell them what
you told me--of the golden cities. Speak! (<i>Then under cover of
the crowd's shouts</i> of "Down with the dog! Torture! Hear! Let
him speak! Don Juan says let him!" <i>etc., he adds in a fierce
whisper to the Indian</i>) If you wish ever to see your home
again!</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>mechanically, in a clear monotonous voice, with
expressionless face</i>) A big land--far mighty
cities--gold--</p>

<p>JUAN--You hear? The cities of gold! (<i>The crowd murmurs
excitedly.</i>)</p>

<p>NANO--There is much gold. The houses have gold on them.</p>

<p>A SOLDIER--Cipango! We'll storm their cities for them!</p>

<p>A SAILOR--Loot, my bullies!</p>

<p>JUAN--Glory and gold for all of you! And now go! (<i>The crowd
are jubilant. Shouts of</i> "Up anchor! Ahoy Cathay! At last! We
sail! Sack! Riches! Gold!" <i>etc. Juan shouts above the
tumult</i>) Go! Disperse! Tomorrow we sail! (<i>A voice
cries,</i> "Long live Don Juan!" <i>The whole mob takes it up.
Juan begins to give way under the strain--wearily</i>) Go.
Go.</p>

<p>THE MOB--(<i>led by a sailor, takes up a sort of chanty song
in mighty chorus, dancing wildly, waving their torches, crowding
out, rear</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Cities of Gold<br>
 In far Cathay--<br>
 Their great Khan is old,<br>
 And his wealth untold<br>
 In prize for our bold<br>
 Who sail away.<br>
 Aye!<br>
 His gold for our bold who sail away!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>as the last of the mob disappear--rushing up to
Juan with great admiration</i>) You have saved him! What they
have said of you is true indeed--lion by nature as well as
name!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>bitterly</i>) Lion? No! Tricky politician! If I had
been the Juan of long ago, I would not have plead or bargained
with such curs. I would have--(<i>He raises his sword
threateningly--then lets his arm sink limply. The sword slips
from his fingers and falls to the ground.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>kneels quickly and presents its hilt to him</i>)
I give you back your sword--to bring good fortune. Now you must
find the golden cities!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>taking it--longingly</i>) I care only for the one,
Beatriz--the golden city of Youth, where you are queen. (<i>She
looks into his face smilingly, mystified as--</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s07">SCENE SEVEN</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Four months later--a strip of beach on the Florida
coast--a bright, moonlight night. The forest runs diagonally from
right, front, to left, rear--a wall of black shadow. The sand
gleams a pallid white in the moonlight. The rhythmic ebb and flow
of waves is heard--their voice on a windless night of
calm.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, an Indian is discovered, standing in
the moonlight, just out of the shadow of the forest. He is old,
but still erect and warrior-like, a chief by his demeanor. His
body, naked save for a piece of deerskin at his waist, is
elaborately painted, as is his face. A knot of feathers is in his
hair. A tomahawk and flint knife are at his waist. He is
motionless and silent as a statue, one hand clasping his unslung
bow as if it were a staff, but he peers intently at some object
in the ocean before him. Finally, he gives an ejaculation of
surprise and makes a motion of summons to the forest behind him.
The Medicine Man glides out of the darkness to his side. This
latter is incredibly old and shrunken, daubed with many insignia
in paint, wearing many ornaments of bone and shell. They confer
together in low tones with much pantomime. A man is evidently
swimming toward them from some strange object out at sea. Other
Indians steal from the forest, form a group in the shadow behind
the two, point out to sea, gesticulate. At a sharp command from
the Chief, they unsling their bows, fit arrows to strings, crouch
in an ambush in the shadow. The Chief does likewise and stands
waiting, prepared for what may come. Nano walks up the beach from
front, left. His naked body glistens with drops of water. He sees
the Chief and stops, raising his right hand above his head. The
Chief makes a sign. The other Indians dart from their ambush and
surround Nano.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHIEF--Bind him.</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>calmly</i>) Is a brother an enemy? (<i>They all
start with surprise at hearing their own language. Nano goes
on.</i>) This is the land of my fathers. I am Nano, a son of
Boanu, who was a chief. (<i>They all stare at him. The Chief
makes a sign to the Medicine Man, who comes forward and examines
Nano's face intently.</i>)</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--His words are truth. He is Nano--or an evil
spirit in his body. (<i>He shakes a charm at him.</i>) Are you
from the Land of the Dead?</p>

<p>NANO--I am of the living. They did not chain me. They think I
fear the sea. I come to warn you. I swam from the great canoes.
They are the warships of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>CHIEF--(<i>mystified</i>) What are Spaniards? Their winged
canoes are like the boats of Gods.</p>

<p>NANO--These are no Gods. They are men who die from wounds.
Their faces are white, but they are evil. They wear shirts that
arrows cannot pierce. They have strange sticks that spit fire and
kill. Their devils make them strong. But they are not true
warriors. They are thieves and rapers of women.</p>

<p>CHIEF--Have they no God?</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>with scorn</i>) Their God is a thing of earth! It is
this! (<i>He touches a gold ornament that the Chief
wears.</i>)</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--(<i>mystified</i>) Gold? Gold is sacred to the
Sun. It can be no God itself.</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>contemptuously</i>) They see only things, not the
spirit behind things. Their hearts are muddy as a pool in which
deer have trampled. Listen. Their Medicine Men tell of a God who
came to them long ago in the form of a man. He taught them to
scorn things. He taught them to look for the spirit behind
things. In revenge, they killed him. They tortured him as a
sacrifice to their Gold Devil. They crossed two big sticks. They
drove little sticks through his hands and feet and pinned him on
the others--thus. (<i>He illustrates. A murmur of horror and
indignation goes up among them.</i>)</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--To torture a God! How did they dare?</p>

<p>NANO--Their devils protected them. And now each place they go,
they carry that figure of a dying God. They do this to strike
fear. They command you to submit when you see how even a God who
fought their evil was tortured. (<i>proudly</i>) But I would
not.</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--(<i>suspiciously</i>) If you defied them, how
are you alive?</p>

<p>NANO--I am craftier than they. They have an old chief who is
cursed with madness. Him I told of the Spring of Life. I said I
would find it for him.</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--Only the Gods can reveal it. Why have you told
this lie?</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>fiercely</i>) Revenge! I have made a plan. Is there
a spring near?</p>

<p>CHIEF--(<i>mystified</i>) Yes. In the forest.</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>with satisfaction</i>) Good! Listen. This mad chief
is the mightiest among them. Without him they would turn cowards.
Tomorrow night I will lead him to the spring. You must lie
hidden. We will kill him there. Is this clear?</p>

<p>CHIEF--Yes.</p>

<p>NANO--I will swim back now. I escaped to tell you of my plan
and warn you. They would lay waste your land as they did mine.
They killed my wives and children. They burned. They tortured.
They chained warriors neck to neck. They beat them with a whip to
dig in the fields like squaws. This old chief led them. My heart
is fire. Until he dies, it will know no peace.</p>

<p>CHIEF--I begin to feel your hatred.</p>

<p>NANO--Then remember to hide by the spring.</p>

<p>CHIEF--We will not forget.</p>

<p>NANO--It is well. (<i>He turns and strides down to the sea.
They stand watching him in silence.</i>)</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--(<i>uneasily, thoughtful</i>) Only devils could
build great canoes that fly with wings. My brothers, they are
evil spirits. Nano has made war with them. They have beaten him.
Can we trust his plan?</p>

<p>CHIEF--What is your counsel?</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--I have heard the voice of the Great Spirit
speaking in the night. Let us first try to propitiate their
devils.</p>

<p>CHIEF--I do not know how to war with devils. That is your
duty. Let us summon the council. (<i>He makes a sign at which his
followers disappear silently into the wood. He and the Medicine
Man follow as--</i></p>

<h1><a name="s08">SCENE EIGHT</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The same. High noon of the following day--glaring
sunlight on the beach, an atmosphere of oppressive heat and</i>
<i>languor. The earth seems dead, preserved in some colorless,
molten fluid. The forest is a matted green wall. The sound of the
sea has the quality of immense exhaustion.</i></p>

<p><i>On the beach, a sort of makeshift altar is being
erected--two round boulders supporting a flat slab of rock. On
top of the slab is placed a shallow bowl made of bark. A group of
Indians, under the direction of the Medicine Man, are hurriedly
putting on the finishing touches to this shrine. They keep
casting awed apprehensive glances seaward. The Medicine Man is
binding two branches of a tree together in the form of a cross.
All the Indians are feathered and painted as for an unusual
solemn occasion.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE INDIANS--(<i>their eyes on the sea as they
work--frightenedly</i>) The small canoes leave the great winged
ones. They are coming! The sun gleams on their shirts that arrows
cannot pierce. Their fire-sticks glitter in the sun. Their faces
are turned. Their faces are pale! They are watching us!</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--(<i>finishing his work</i>) Keep your hearts
brave! (<i>giving the cross to two Indians</i>) Here. This is
their totem pole. Stand it there. (<i>They dig a hole in the sand
before the altar and set the cross there; but they make the
mistake of setting it head down. The Medicine Man grunts with
satisfaction.</i>) They will think we adore the same devil. They
will leave us in peace.</p>

<p>INDIAN--(<i>his eyes on the sea</i>) The last canoe has left
the great ships. (<i>He gives a cry of fear echoed by the
others.</i>) Aie! Fire and smoke! (<i>They cower. The hollow boom
of a cannon fired in salute reverberates over the sea. They all
shrink with terror, bowing their heads.</i>)</p>

<p>INDIAN--(<i>awe-struck</i>) The Thunder fights with them!</p>

<p>INDIAN--They are white Gods!</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--(<i>frightened himself, but rallying his
followers sternly</i>) You have the hearts of squaws. Quick!
Where is the gold? (<i>An Indian comes to him with an earthenware
vessel. He empties it out on the bowl on the top of the altar. It
is full of gold nuggets of different sizes. They form a heap
glowing in the sun.</i>)</p>

<p>INDIANS--They come! They come!</p>

<p>MEDICINE MAN--(<i>sternly</i>) Pretend to worship their gold
devil but pray to our Great Father, the Sun. He can defeat all
devils. Pray to him! (<i>An Indian starts to beat rhythmically on
the small drum. The Medicine Man lifts his shrill voice in the
first strains of the chant. Immediately the others all join in as
if hypnotized.</i>) Great Father, Mighty One, Ruler of Earth.
Maker of Days. Ripener of the Corn. Creator of Life. Look down
upon us out of your Sky-Tent. Let our song rise to you. Let it
enter your heart. Mighty One, hear us. Hide not your face in
clouds. Bless us at the dawn. And at the day's end. (<i>They form
a circle and dance about the altar, their eyes raised to the sun
overhead. Their chant hides the noise of the Spaniards landing.
Then the Spaniards appear from the left, front. First comes Juan,
his face wild and haggard, his eyes obsessed. He is accompanied
by Luis. Following him are a squad of soldiers, guarding Nano,
who is in chains. Then come four Franciscan monks, led by
Quesada, who wears a sword and pistol over his robe. The others
carry crosses. Following them is a group of nobles, richly
dressed. Then come ranks of soldiers. They all stare at this
Indian ceremony with contemptuous scorn.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>irritably</i>) Make them cease their accursed noise,
Luis. Let Nano speak to them.</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>advancing toward the Indians--in a loud but friendly
voice, raising his right hand</i>) Peace, brothers. (<i>The
Indians stop, petrified, staring with awe at the white men. The
Medicine Man lifts his right hand and advances a step toward
Luis. Quesada notices the cross, utters a furious exclamation,
strides forward to verify his suspicion. When he sees that it is
indeed upside down his face grows livid with fury.</i>)</p>

<p>QUESADA--The cross head down! The black mass! (<i>He pulls out
his pistol.</i>) Blaspheming dog! (<i>He fires. The Medicine Man
falls. The other Indians who have shrunk back toward the woods in
terror at his first move, now turn tail in panic and
flee.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>in horror</i>) Stop, Quesada! (<i>Quesada pulls up
the cross and is setting it back upright when the Medicine Man,
by a last dying effort, draws his knife, and writhing to his
feet, plunges it into Quesada's back. They both fall together,
the Indian dead. Quesada shudders and is still. A yell of rage
goes up from the Spaniards. They rush forward toward the woods as
if to pursue the Indians but Juan shouts a command.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--Halt! Fools! (<i>They stop prudently but sullenly. Juan
turns to Luis, who is kneeling beside Quesada.</i>) Is he
dead?</p>

<p>LUIS--Yes. (<i>crossing himself</i>) May his soul rest in
peace. (<i>All echo this, crossing themselves.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
(<i>mockingly</i>) And now it is his eye, his tooth. (<i>then
with a shudder</i>) Take him away. This is a bloody baptism for
Cathay. (<i>turning to Nano as the soldiers carry the bodies
aside</i>) Is this the land, Nano?</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>his eyes smoldering with hate</i>) Yes.</p>

<p>JUAN--You said it was a wonder land--a land of flowers. I see
no flowers.</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>in a sinister tone</i>) In the forest--flowers grow
by a spring--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>harshly--with an apprehensive glance about</i>)
Silence!</p>

<p>A NOBLE--(<i>from the group that has been stirring
impatiently</i>) Your Excellency. The banners of Castile and
Aragon wait on your pleasure.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>making a confused gesture as if wiping cobwebs from
his brain</i>) Yes--yes--I must take possession. Bring the
banners. (<i>He kneels on one knee. They all do likewise.</i>) In
the name of Jesus Christ, Our Lord, and of his most gracious
Majesty, the sovereign of Castile and Aragon, I do hereby annex
to his dominions this land and all its environs. And I call the
land Florida. (<i>He bends and kisses the sand. The banners are
planted in the ground, where they hang motionless from their
poles. Juan, having made this effort, seems to fall into a
stupor.</i>)</p>

<p>A NOBLE--(<i>in a mocking whisper</i>) A pretty name!</p>

<p>A NOBLE--He has grown imbecile. Will he go spring-hunting
here, too? My faith, with all the water he has drunk in the past
four months, he must be flooded. (<i>They all snicker at
this.</i>)</p>

<p>A NOBLE--(<i>impatiently</i>) Will he never get off his knees
and let us rise?</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>sensing what is going on behind their backs--to
Juan--who seems to be praying with bowed head--plucking his
sleeve</i>) Juan! Come!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>vaguely</i>) I was praying--to what God, who knows?
(<i>He rises to his feet weakly. At this, they all rise.</i>)</p>

<p>A NOBLE--(<i>pointing excitedly</i>) Look! In that bowl on the
stones. Is it not gold? (<i>They all rush forward to the altar.
The noble picks up a piece of it--his voice hoarse with greedy
triumph</i>) Gold! (<i>They all grab at the bowl, upsetting its
contents on the sand. They bend down and clutch for it
crying</i>) Gold! This must be a rich land! There must be more!
The Golden Cities are near! Cathay at last! (<i>The soldiers
forget discipline, break ranks, form a disorderly, pushing crowd
about their leaders. Even the monks edge forward
inquisitively.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>urgently</i>) Juan! Look! This is disgraceful!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>coming to himself with a start--in a furious tone of
command</i>) Get back to your ranks! A brave example you set,
nobles of Spain! (<i>His personality is compelling. They all
slink to their former order again, muttering rebelliously. Juan
seems suddenly seized with a wild exultation.</i>) Cathay! We
have found Cathay! This is the land--the Flowery Land! Our dreams
lie hidden here! Sing the Te Deum! Sing! (<i>There is an
oppressive silence for a moment, in which the heat, the sun
glaring on the beach, the green of the forest, all nature seems
to lay upon these men a mysterious spell, a sudden exhausted
recognition of their own defeat. Then the Franciscan monks raise
their voices mechanically and spiritlessly in the Te Deum. Other
listless voices gradually join theirs as--</i></p>

<h1><a name="s09">SCENE NINE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>About midnight--in the forest. Gigantic tree-trunks,
entwined with vines in flower, are in the foreground. Festoons of
Spanish moss hang clear to the ground from the branches. Through
the network one sees a circular clearing, grass-grown, flooded
with moonlight. There is the soft murmur of a spring which
bubbles from the ground in the center of this open space. Indians
are crouched in ambush among the trees, motionless, their eyes
fixed on the clearing.</i></p>

<p><i>The stillness is broken by the whistled call of a bird. The
Indians stir alertly. One of them whistles in answer to the call.
An Indian creeps swiftly in from the left. The Chief comes from
his place of ambush to meet him.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHIEF--He comes?</p>

<p>INDIAN--He has entered the forest.</p>

<p>CHIEF--I will give Nano the signal when we are ready. Go.
Hide. (<i>The Indian takes a place with the others. The Chief
fits an arrow to his bow and crouches in the shadow. There is a
pause of silence--then the noise of someone pushing his way
through the woods at the rear of the clearing. Nano appears
there, followed by Juan.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--Why do you stop?</p>

<p>NANO--This is the place.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>looking around him disappointedly</i>) This?</p>

<p>NANO--There is the spring.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>stepping forward to look at it--with growing
anger</i>) It looks a common spring like any other. Beware, dog!
In these past months you have shown me many springs--</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>quickly</i>) The voyage was long. There were many
islands. You forced me to lead you to a spring on each. But I
told you the Spring of Life was here.</p>

<p>JUAN--I feared your revenge might lie. (<i>relapsed into a
mood of somber preoccupation--bitterly</i>) I drank of every one.
I closed my eyes. I felt the stirring of rebirth. Fool! Always
the mirror in the spring showed me the same loathsome blighted
face--(<i>He groans--then with a harsh laugh</i>) A sacred grove,
the legend says! Some of those springs bubbled from sandy water!
Beautiful maidens? There were none. At one place I found an old
hag filling her bowl, who drank and mumbled at me. (<i>then in a
harsh tone of command</i>) Nano! I command you to tell me if you
have lied. (<i>distractedly</i>) I must have certainty, be it of
faith or despair!</p>

<p>NANO--This is the spring.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>looking around him</i>) But where are the trees with
golden fruit, the maidens, the fountain--? (<i>bewildered,
staring--grasping at hope</i>) And yet--this spot has singular
beauty. I feel enchantment. But why do I shudder? (<i>A low
whistled signal comes from the Chief hidden on the edge of the
clearing. Juan starts.</i>) Sssh! What was that?</p>

<p>NANO--A bird. (<i>insistently</i>) It is a magic spring.
Drink!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>bending over the spring</i>) A mirror of moonlight.
The dead eyes of a corpse stare back in mine. (<i>He kneels by
the spring as if fascinated.</i>) I dare not drink. To whom can I
pray? Beatriz! Oh, to hear your voice once more, to see your
face! And yet I see you everywhere. Your spirit inspires all
things wherever there is beauty. I hear you call in the song of
the waves, the wind is your breath, the trees reach out with your
arms, the dawn and sunset promise with your lips! You are
everywhere and nowhere--part of all life but mine! (<i>He breaks
off, turning distrustful, harried eyes on the impatient
Nano--bitterly</i>) I am a spectacle for laughter, eh? A
grotesque old fool!</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>in a fierce tone of command</i>) Drink!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>hectically--goading himself to action</i>) The test.
Spirit of Eternal Youth, I pray to you! Beatriz! (<i>He bends
down and drinks. As he does so Nano darts away from him to the
woods in front.</i>)</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>hurriedly</i>) Kill when he stands again! (<i>The
Indians can be seen raising their bows, taking aim.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>having drunk, remains kneeling by the spring--in a
trembling tone of hesitating joy</i>) New life thrills in me! Is
it youth? Do I dream? Then let me never wake till the end of
time! (<i>then harshly</i>) Coward! How often have you looked
death in the face. Are you afraid of life? Open! Open and see!
(<i>He opens his eyes and stares down into the spring. A terrible
groan tears from his breast.</i>) O God! (<i>His grief is turned
immediately into a frenzy of rage.</i>) Treacherous dog. You
betrayed me. (<i>He leaps to his feet, drawing his sword. There
is a twanging of many bows, the whiz of a flight of arrows. Juan
falls, clutches at the grass, is still. The Indians pour out into
the clearing but keep a cautious distance from Juan.</i>)</p>

<p>NANO--(<i>With more courage than they, he bends down over the
body.</i>) He wore no shining shirt. He is dead. (<i>He does a
wild dance of savage triumph beside the body--then stops as
suddenly.</i>) Quick. To their camp. The great Spirit has made
them helpless. Be brave and kill! (<i>He runs swiftly into the
woods, followed by the whole band, brandishing their weapons.
There is a pause. Then the fierce yells of the savages as they
fall upon the sleeping camp, the howls of terror of the
Spaniards, the screams of the dying, a few futile
musket-shots.</i>)</p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The same clearing in the woods some hours later.
There is no intervening fringe of trees in this scene, the open
space is in full view. The Spring is at center. The wall of
forest forms a semicircular background. As the curtain rises,
there is a pitch-blackness and silence except for the murmur of
the Spring. Then the sound of someone struggling to rise from the
ground, falling back again with a groan of pain. Juan's voice
comes out of the darkness.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>as if he had just regained consciousness--then with
a groan of rage and pain as memory returns</i>) Fool! Why did I
look? I might have died in my dream. (<i>a pause--weakly</i>)
Sleep seems humming in my ears. Or is it--death!--death, the
Merciful One! (<i>He stirs and his voice suddenly grows
strident.</i>) No, No! Why have I lived! To die alone like a
beast in the wilderness? (<i>with a bitter mocking despair</i>) O
Son of God, is this Thy justice? Does not the Savior of Man know
magnanimity? True, I prayed for a miracle which was not Thine.
Let me be damned then, but (<i>passionately</i>) let me believe
in Thy Kingdom! Show me Thy miracle--a sign--a word--a second's
vision of what I am that I should have lived and died! A test,
Lord God of Hosts! (<i>He laughs with a scornful bravado.</i>)
Nothing! (<i>But even as he speaks a strange unearthly light
begins to flood down upon a spot on the edge of the clearing on
the right. Startled in spite of himself</i>) This light--the moon
has waned--(<i>Beneath the growing light a form takes shape--a
tall woman's figure, like a piece of ancient sculpture, shrouded
in long draperies of a blue that is almost black. The face is a
pale mask with features indistinguishable save for the eyes that
stare straight ahead with a stony penetration that sees through
and beyond things. Her arms are rigid at her sides, the palms of
the hands turned outward. Juan stares at her, defiance striving
with his awe.</i>) What are you? (<i>forcing a sneer</i>) An
angel in answer to my prayer? (<i>He cannot control a
shudder--tries to calm himself. He stares at the figure--after a
pause, boldly</i>) Or are you Death? Why then I have often
laughed in your eyes! (<i>tauntingly</i>) Off with your mask,
coward! (<i>mockingly but uneasy</i>) Delightful Lady, you are
enigmatic. One must embrace you with bold arms, tear off your
masquerade. That was my pastime once--to play at love as gaming.
Were I the Juan of long ago--but you see I am old now and
wounded. (<i>He pauses. The figure is frozen. He asks a bit
falteringly</i>) Are you--Death? Then wait--(<i>in passionate
invocation</i>) O Beatriz! Let me hear your voice again in mercy
of farewell! (<i>As if in answer to this the voice of Beatriz
sings from the darkness</i>)</p>

<p>VOICE--</p>

<blockquote>

 Forever blooming<br>
 Life is a fountain<br>

<p>JUAN--(<i>raptly</i>) Youth! (<i>As the song is sung, the same
mystical light floods down slowly about the Spring, which is
transformed into a gigantic fountain, whose waters, arched with
rainbows, seem to join earth and sky, forming a shimmering veil,
which hides the background of forest. Juan and the figure are
left at the edge of this, on the outside. The form of Beatriz
appears within as if rising from the spring. She dances in
ecstasy--the personified spirit of the fountain. Juan cries with
a voice trembling with joy</i>) The Fountain! Let me drink!
(<i>He tries to drag himself to it but cannot--in anguish</i>)
Must I die--? (<i>making a furious gesture of defiance at the
figure and struggling to rise</i>) No! I defy you! (<i>Exhausted,
he sinks back crying beseechingly</i>) Beatriz! (<i>But she seems
not to see or hear him. Juan half sobs in despair</i>) She will
not see! She will not hear! Fountain, cruel as the heart of
youth, what mercy have you for the old and wounded? (<i>He sinks
down overcome by weakness. Beatriz vanishes from the fountain. In
her place appears the form of a Chinese poet. He is a venerable
old man with the mild face of a dreamer and scholar. He carries a
block and writes upon it with a brush, absorbed in contemplation.
Juan looking up and seeing him--startled</i>) What are you?
(<i>groping at some clue in his memory</i>) I know--that night in
Granada--the Moor's tale--(<i>excitedly</i>) Of the poet from the
East who told his father the Fountain lie! Are you not that
poisoner of life? (<i>The poet raises his hand as if</i> <i>in
summons. The form of the Moorish minstrel of Scene One appears at
his side.</i>) The Moor! (<i>raging</i>) Infidel dog! Your lie
has cursed me! (<i>The form of Nano appears at the other side of
the Chinese poet. Juan struggles to reach his sword in a
fury.</i>) Murderer! (<i>Then his eyes are caught by a fourth
figure which materializes beside the Moor. It is Luis as he was
in Scene One. With a cry of joy</i>) Luis--old friend--(<i>Then
as Luis seems neither to see nor hear him, he sink back
helplessly.</i>) No--another mocking phantom! (<i>He watches the
Chinese poet, who seems to be reading what he has written to all
of them.</i>) See! The dead lie to the living. It passes on--from
East to West--round the round world--from old worlds to
new--cheating the old and wounded--Ha! (<i>He laughs harshly and
wildly. The Chinese poet takes the Indian by one hand, the Moor
by the other. These latter stretch out their hands to Luis, who
takes them, thus completing the circle. Beatriz' voice can be
heard singing</i>)</p>

<p>VOICE--</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>(<i>As she sings, the four forms disappear as if they were
dissolved in the fountain.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>lost in the ecstasy of her song</i>) Sing on, Youth!
(<i>with a start as the song stops--stupidly</i>) The ghosts are
gone. What is the answer to their riddle? I am no poet. I have
striven for what the hand can grasp. What is left when Death
makes the hand powerless? (<i>addresses the figure pitifully,
trying to mock</i>) O Mighty Relaxer of hands, have you no vision
for the graspers of earth? (<i>The figure raises a summoning
hand. One by one, within the fountain, solemn figures
materialize. First the Chinese poet, now robed as a Buddhist
priest; then the Moorish minstrel, dressed as a priest of Islam;
and then the Medicine Man as he was in Scene Eight, decked out in
all the paint and regalia of his office; lastly, Luis, the
Dominican monk of the</i> <i>present. Each one carries the symbol
of his religion before him. They appear clearly for a moment,
then fade from sight, seeming to dissolve in the fountain. Juan
has stared at them with straining eyes--in a bewildered
voice</i>) All faiths--they vanish--are one and
equal--within--(<i>awe and reverence creeping into his voice</i>)
What are you, Fountain? That from which all life springs and to
which it must return--God! Are all dreams of you but the one
dream? (<i>bowing his head miserably</i>) I do not know. Come
back, Youth. Tell me this secret! (<i>For a moment the voice of
Beatriz is heard from the darkness.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Death is a mist<br>
 Veiling sunrise.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>(<i>Juan seems to fall into a rapt spell. The form of an old
Indian woman appears from the left. She falters forward, a wooden
bowl under her arm, as if she were going to fill it at the
fountain.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>recognizing her aghast</i>) Damned hag! I remember
you waited beside a spring to mock me! Begone! (<i>But the old
woman stretches out her hands to him with a mysterious
beseeching. Juan shudders--then after a struggle with himself
gets to his feet painfully.</i>) So be it. Sit here by me. I am
old, too--and, poor woman, you cannot fill your bowl there. Come.
(<i>He grasps her hands. In a flash her mask of age disappears.
She is Beatriz. Juan gazes at her in an ecstasy--faltering, his
mind groping</i>) Beatriz! Age--Youth--They are the same rhythm
of eternal life! (<i>Without his noticing it, Beatriz recedes
from him and vanishes in the Fountain. He raises his face to the
sky--with halting joy</i>) Light comes! Light creeps into my
soul! (<i>Then he sees the figure walk slowly from its place and
vanish in the Fountain.</i>) Death is no more! (<i>The figure
materializes again within the Fountain but this time there is no
mask, the face is that of Beatriz, her form grown tall, majestic,
vibrant with power. Her arms are raised above her head. Her whole
body soars upward. A radiant, dancing fire, proceeding from the
source of the Fountain, floods over and envelops her until her
figure is like the heart of its flame. Juan stares at this vision
for a moment, then sinks on his knees--exultantly</i>) I see!
Fountain Everlasting, time without end! Soaring flame of the
spirit transfiguring Death! All is within! All things dissolve,
flow on eternally! O aspiring fire of life, sweep the dark soul
of man! Let us burn in thy unity! (<i>Beatriz' voice rises
triumphantly</i>)</p>

Juan's voice is heard sobbing with happiness.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--O God, Fountain of Eternity, Thou art the All in One,
the One in All--the Eternal Becoming which is Beauty! (<i>He
falls unconscious. A pause. Then the faint misty light of the
dawn floats over the clearing. Juan is seen lying where he had
fallen. There is the noise of someone approaching from the woods
in the rear, Luis and a brother Dominican enter from the
forest.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>seeing Juan</i>) God be praised! (<i>He rushes
forward and kneels by Juan's body. Juan stirs and groans.</i>) He
moves! Juan! It's Luis! Our friends were murdered. A boat from
the fleet is waiting--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>in a dreaming ecstasy</i>) God--Thou art all--</p>

<p>DOMINICAN--He prays.</p>

<p>LUIS--Delirium. Let us carry him. We'll sail for the nearest
settlement--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>as they raise him</i>) Light! I see and know!</p>

<p>LUIS--It is the dawn, Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>exultantly</i>) The dawn! (<i>They carry him out

<h1><a name="s11">SCENE ELEVEN</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Some months later. The courtyard of a Dominican
monastery in Cuba. A crude little home-made fountain is in
center. This is the only adornment of the quadrangle of bald,
sun-baked earth, enclosed on the left and in the rear by a high
white wall, on the right by the monastery building itself. The
entrance to this is an arched doorway surmounted by a crucifix of
carved wood. Two niches on either side of this door shelter
primitive wooden figures of the Holy Family and Saint Dominic. In
the</i> <i>wall, center, is another arched door with a cross
above it. Beyond the wall nature can be seen and felt--vivid,
colorful, burgeoning with the manifold, compelling life of the
tropics. Palm trees lean over the wall casting their graceful
shadows within. Vines in flower have climbed to the top and are
starting to creep down inside.</i></p>

<p><i>A sunset sky of infinite depth glows with mysterious
splendor.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, Juan and the Father Superior are
discovered. Juan is asleep, reclining on a sort of improvised
invalid's chair, his cloak wrapped around him, facing the
fountain. He is pale and emaciated but his wasted countenance has
gained an entirely new quality, the calm of a deep spiritual
serenity. The Father Superior is a portly monk with a simple
round face, gray hair and beard. His large eyes have the opaque
calm of a ruminating cow's. The door in the rear is opened and
Luis enters. He closes the door carefully and tiptoes
forward.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>in a whisper</i>) He is sleeping?</p>

<p>FATHER SUPERIOR--As you see, Father.</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>looking down at Juan</i>) How calm his face is--as
if he saw a vision of peace.</p>

<p>FATHER SUPERIOR--It is a blessed miracle he has lived so
long.</p>

<p>LUIS--He has been waiting. (<i>sadly</i>) And now, I am afraid
his desire is fulfilled--but not as he dreamed. Rather the cup of
gall and wormwood--</p>

<p>FATHER SUPERIOR--(<i>mystified</i>) You mean the caravel
brings him bad tidings?</p>

<p>LUIS--Yes; and I must wake him to prepare his mind.</p>

<p>FATHER SUPERIOR--I will leave you with him. It is near vesper
time. (<i>He turns and goes into the monastery.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>touching Juan on the arm--gently</i>) Juan, awake.
(<i>Juan opens his eyes.</i>) The caravel has anchored.</p>

<p>JUAN--From Porto Rico?</p>

<p>LUIS--Yes.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>with an air of certainty--with exultant joy</i>)
Then Beatriz is here!</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>disturbed--evasively</i>) There has been a frightful
insurrection of the Indians. Diego was killed. (<i>hastily</i>)
But I will not trouble you with that. (<i>then slowly</i>)
Beatriz comes to nurse you--(<i>with warning emphasis</i>)--her
second father, those were her words.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>smiling</i>) You need not emphasize. I know her
heart. (<i>then earnestly</i>) But I must tell her my truth.
(<i>then with a sort of pleading for assurance</i>) It is for
that I have waited, to tell her of the love I bore her--now--as
farewell--when she cannot misunderstand. (<i>proudly</i>) My love
was no common thing. It was the one time Beauty touched my life.
I wish to live in her memory as what she was to me. (<i>sinking
back--with a flickering smile, weakly</i>) Come, old friend, are
you grown so ascetic you deny my right to lay this Golden
City--the only one I ever conquered--at the feet of Beauty?</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>kindly persuasive</i>) Silence is better, Juan. You
should renounce--</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>gently</i>) All is renounced. But do you begrudge a
traveler if he begs a flower from this earth, a last token of the
world's grace, to lend farewell the solace of regret?</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>more and more troubled</i>) Juan--I--I speak
because--you have suffered--and now--I would not have you suffer
more, dear friend. (<i>then blurting out most brusquely</i>) The
caravel brings you a surprise. Your nephew, Juan, has arrived
from Spain and comes from Porto Rico to greet you.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>vaguely</i>) My nephew? (<i>The sound of voices
comes from inside the monastery.</i>) Beatriz! (<i>The Father
Superior appears in the doorway ushering in Beatriz and Juan's
nephew. They are followed by the Duenna and the nephew's servant,
who carries his master's cloak and a lute. During the following
scene these two remain standing respectfully by the doorway for a
time, then go back into the monastery, the servant leaving the
cloak and lute on the ground beside the doorway. The Father
Superior retires immediately. Luis, after a clasp of Juan's hand,
also withdraws, exchanging greetings as he passes the nephew and
Beatriz. Beatriz glows with fulfillment, is very apparently
deeply in love. The nephew is a slender, graceful young cavalier.
He is dressed richly.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>halting a moment with a shocked exclamation as
she sees Juan's wasted face--then rushing forward and flinging
herself on her knees beside his chair. Hastily</i>) Don Juan! Oh,
this is happiness--to find you still--recovered from your wounds!
Oh, I'll say prayers of thanksgiving! (<i>Impulsively she kisses
him.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>thrilled--choked--unable to say but one word</i>)
Beatriz! Beatriz!</p>

<p>NEPHEW--(<i>kneels and kisses Juan's hand. Startled, Juan's
eyes search his face keenly, apprehensive of what he, too,
plainly sees there.</i>) I greet you, sir. God grant you may soon
be strong again.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>weakly</i>) Soon--I shall be strong--against all
wounds. (<i>after a pause</i>) And so your name is Juan, too?</p>

<p>NEPHEW--In your honor. Though I can add no honor to it, I hope
to bear it worthily.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>hostility creeping into his tone</i>) You come out
here adventuring?</p>

<p>NEPHEW--I come to serve Spain!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>harshly</i>) A heart as steeled as your sword. Have
you that?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>eagerly--somewhat hurt by Juan's reception</i>)
Oh, he is brave! When the mob tried to storm the palace it was
Juan who led the defenders.</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>more and more agitated--trying to hide his growing
resentment under effusive amiability</i>) Bravely done! But you
have doubtless heard great tales of mountains of jewels--Golden
Cities of Cathay--you hope to grow rich.</p>

<p>NEPHEW--(<i>proudly</i>) I do not care for riches; and as for
Golden Cities, I only wish to plant Spain's banner on their
citadels!</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>inspired by respect in spite of himself</i>) Brave
dreams! Echoes blown down the wind of years.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>looking at the nephew with great pride as Juan
searches her face</i>) He is as you were in my mother's tales.
(<i>She and the nephew are held by each other's eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>after a conquering struggle with his
bitterness--fatalistically</i>) So--thus old heart--in silence.
(<i>then rousing himself--intensely</i>) But with joy! with joy!
(<i>They look at him in puzzled alarm. He smiles gently at
Beatriz.</i>) Then you have found him at last--my double?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>blushing, confusedly</i>) I--I do not know, Don
Juan.</p>

<p>JUAN--Then I know. (<i>musing a bit sadly</i>) You have stolen
my last gesture. An old man had a tale to tell you--oh, so brave
a tale!--but now he sees that if youth cannot, age must keep its
secrets! A sad old ghost to haunt your memory, that would be a
poor wedding gift. (<i>They again look from him to each other,
mystified and apprehensive. Juan suddenly looks up at them--with
a startling directness</i>) You love each other! (<i>He hurries
on with feverish gayety.</i>) Forgive--I'm a rough soldier--and
there is need for haste. Quick. Do you not ask my blessing?</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>falling on her knees beside him--happily</i>) Oh,
yes, good Don Juan! (<i>The nephew kneels beside her.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>He raises his hands over their heads.</i>) Youth of
this earth--love--hail--and farewell! May you be blessed forever!
(<i>He touches their heads with his hands--then sinks back,
closing his eyes. They rise and stand looking down at him
uncertainly.</i>)</p>

<p>NEPHEW--(<i>after a pause--in a whisper</i>) He wishes to
sleep.</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>as they walk apart, in a whisper, the tears in
her eyes</i>) Oh, Juan, I'm afraid--and yet--I am not sad.</p>

<p>NEPHEW--(<i>takes her in his arms passionately</i>) My life!
My soul! (<i>He kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--My love!</p>

<p>NEPHEW--Life is beautiful! The earth sings for us! Let us
sing, too! (<i>He strides over to where the lute is and picks it
up.</i>)</p>

<p>BEATRIZ--(<i>happily</i>) Yes--(<i>then reminded</i>) Ssshh!
(<i>She points at Juan.</i>)</p>

<p>NEPHEW--(<i>urgingly</i>) He is asleep. We can go out beyond
the walls. (<i>He puts his arms around her and leads her out
through the door in rear.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>opening his eyes and looking after them, a tender
smile on his lips</i>) Yes! Go where Beauty is! Sing! (<i>From
outside the voices of Beatriz and his nephew are heard mingling
in their version of the fountain song.</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love is a flower<br>
 Forever blooming<br>
 Beauty a fountain<br>
 Forever flowing<br>
 Upward into the source of sunshine,<br>
 Upward into the azure heaven;<br>
 One with God but<br>
 Ever returning<br>
 To kiss the earth that the flower may live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>(<i>Juan listens in an ecstasy, bows his head, weeps. Then he
sinks back with closed eyes exhaustedly. Luis enters from the
monastery.</i>)</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>hurries forward in alarm</i>) Juan! (<i>He hears the
song and is indignant</i>) Have they lost all feeling? I will
soon stop--(<i>He starts for the door in rear.</i>)</p>

<p>JUAN--(<i>in a ringing voice</i>) No! I am that song! One must
accept, absorb, give back, become oneself a symbol! Juan Ponce de
Leon is past! He is resolved into the thousand moods of beauty
that make up happiness--color of the sunset, of tomorrow's dawn,
breath of the great Trade wind--sunlight on grass, an insect's
song, the rustle of leaves, an ant's ambitions. (<i>in an
ecstasy</i>) Oh, Luis, I begin to know eternal youth! I have
found my Fountain! O Fountain of Eternity, take back this drop,
my soul! (<i>He dies. Luis bows his head and weeps.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER SUPERIOR--(<i>enters from the right</i>) Vespers.
(<i>then in a voice of awe as he stares at Juan</i>) Is
he--dead?</p>

<p>LUIS--(<i>aroused--exaltedly</i>) No! He lives in God! Let us
pray. (<i>Luis sinks on his knees beside Juan's body, the Father
Superior beside him. He lifts his eyes and clasped hands to
heaven and prays fervently. The voices of Beatriz and the nephew
in the fountain song seem to rise to an exultant pitch. Then the
chant of the monks swells out, deep and vibrant. For a moment the
two strains blend into harmony, fill the air in an
all-comprehending hymn of the mystery of life as</i></p>
