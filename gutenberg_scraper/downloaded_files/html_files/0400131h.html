<h2>SCENE ONE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Exterior and interior of Lazarus' home at Bethany.
The main room at the front end of the house is shown--a long,
low-ceilinged, sparely furnished chamber, with white walls gray
in the fading daylight that enters from three small windows at
the left. To the left of center several long tables placed
lengthwise to the width of the room, around which many chairs for
guests have been placed. In the rear wall, right, a door leading
into the rest of the house. On the left, a doorway opening on a
road where a crowd of men has gathered. On the right, another
doorway leading to the yard where there is a crowd of
women.</i></p>

<p><i>Inside the house, on the men's side, seven male Guests are
grouped by the door, watching Lazarus with frightened awe,
talking hesitantly in low whispers. The Chorus of Old Men, seven
in number, is drawn up in a crescent, in the far corner, right,
facing Lazarus.</i></p>

<p>(<i>All of these people are masked in accordance with the
following scheme: There are seven periods of life shown: Boyhood
[or Girlhood], Youth, Young Manhood [or Womanhood], Manhood [or
Womanhood], Middle Age, Maturity and Old Age; and each of these
periods is represented by seven different masks of general types
of character as follows: The Simple, Ignorant; the Happy, Eager;
the Self-Tortured, Introspective; the Proud, Self-Reliant; the
Servile, Hypocritical; the Revengeful, Cruel; the Sorrowful,
Resigned. Thus in each crowd [this includes among the men the
Seven Guests who are composed of one male of each period-type as
period one--type one, period two--type two, and so on up to
period seven--type seven] there are forty-nine different
combinations of period and type. Each type has a distinct
predominant color for its costumes which varies in kind according
to its period. The masks of the Chorus of Old Men are double the
size of the others. They are all seven in the Sorrowful, Resigned
type of Old Age.</i>)</p>

<p><i>On a raised platform at the middle of the one table
placed</i> <i>lengthwise at center sits Lazarus, his head haloed
and his body illumined by a soft radiance as of tiny
phosphorescent flames.</i></p>

<p><i>Lazarus, freed now from the fear of death, wears no
mask.</i></p>

<p><i>In appearance Lazarus is tall and powerful, about fifty
years of age, with a mass of gray-black hair and a heavy beard.
His face recalls that of a statue of a divinity of Ancient Greece
in its general structure and particularly in its quality of
detached serenity. It is dark-complected, ruddy and brown, the
color of rich earth upturned by the plow, calm but furrowed deep
with the marks of former suffering endured with a grim fortitude
that had never softened into resignation. His forehead is broad
and noble, his eyes black and deep-set. Just now he is staring
straight before him as if his vision were still fixed beyond
life.</i></p>

<p><i>Kneeling beside him with bowed heads are his wife, Miriam,
his sisters, Martha and Mary, and his Father and Mother.</i></p>

<p><i>Miriam is a slender, delicate woman of thirty-five, dressed
in deep black, who holds one of his hands in both of hers, and
keeps her lips pressed to it. The upper part of her face is
covered by a mask which conceals her forehead, eyes and nose, but
leaves her mouth revealed. The mask is the pure pallor of marble,
the expression that of a statue of Woman, of her eternal
acceptance of the compulsion of motherhood, the inevitable cycle
of love into pain into joy and new love into separation and pain
again and the loneliness of age. The eyes of the mask are almost
closed. Their gaze turns within, oblivious to the life outside,
as they dream down on the child forever in memory at her breast.
The mouth of Miriam is sensitive and sad, tender with an eager,
understanding smile of self-forgetful love, the lips still fresh
and young. Her skin, in contrast to the mask, is sunburned and
earth-colored like that of Lazarus. Martha, Mary and the two
parents all wear full masks which broadly reproduce their own
characters. Martha is a buxom middle-aged housewife, plain and
pleasant. Mary is young and pretty, nervous and high-strung. The
Father is a small, thin, feeble old man of over eighty, meek and
pious. The Mother is tall and stout, over sixty-five, a gentle,
simple woman.</i></p>

<p><i>All the masks of these Jews of the first two scenes of the
play are pronouncedly Semitic.</i></p>

<p><i>A background of twilight sky. A dissolving touch of sunset
still lingers on the horizon.</i></p>

<p><i>It is some time after the miracle and Jesus has gone
away.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>in a quavering rising and falling
chant--their arms outstretched toward Lazarus</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus wept!<br>
 Behold how he loved him!<br>
 He that liveth,<br>
 He that believeth,<br>
 Shall never die!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>on either side of house, echo the chant</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He that believeth<br>
 Shall never die!<br>
 Lazarus, come forth!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FIRST GUEST--(<i>a Simple Boy--in a frightened whisper after a
pause of dead silence</i>) That strange light seems to come from
within him! (<i>with awe</i>) Think of it! For four days he lay
in the tomb! (<i>turns away with a shudder</i>)</p>

<p>SECOND GUEST--(<i>a Happy Youth--with reassuring
conviction</i>) It is a holy light. It came from Jesus.</p>

<p>FIFTH GUEST--(<i>an Envious, Middle-Aged Man</i>) Maybe if the
truth were known, our friend there never really died at all!</p>

<p>FOURTH GUEST--(<i>a Defiant Man, indignantly</i>) Do you doubt
the miracle? I tell you I was here in this house when Lazarus
died!</p>

<p>SEVENTH GUEST--(<i>an Aged, Sorrowful Man</i>) And I used to
visit him every day. He knew himself his hour was near.</p>

<p>FOURTH GUEST--He wished for death! He said to me one day: "I
have known my fill of life and the sorrow of living. Soon I shall
know peace." And he smiled. It was the first time I had seen him
smile in years.</p>

<p>THIRD GUEST--(<i>a Self-Tortured Man--gloomily</i>) Yes, of
late years his life had been one long misfortune. One after
another his children died--</p>

<p>SIXTH GUEST--(<i>a Mature Man with a cruel face--with a harsh
laugh</i>) They were all girls. Lazarus had no luck.</p>

<p>SEVENTH GUEST--The last was a boy, the one that died at birth.
You are forgetting him.</p>

<p>THIRD GUEST--Lazarus could never forget. Not only did his son
die but Miriam could never bear him more children.</p>

<p>FIFTH GUEST--(<i>practically</i>) But he could not blame bad
luck for everything. Take the loss of his father's wealth since
he took over the management. That was his own doing. He was a bad
farmer, a poor breeder of sheep, and a bargainer so easy to cheat
it hurt one's conscience to trade with him!</p>

<p>SIXTH GUEST--(<i>with a sneer--maliciously</i>) You should
know best about that! (<i>a suppressed laugh from those around
him</i>)</p>

<p>FIRST GUEST--(<i>who has been gazing at Lazarus--softly</i>)
Ssssh! Look at his face! (<i>They all stare. A pause.</i>)</p>

<p>SECOND GUEST--(<i>with wondering awe</i>) Do you remember him,
neighbors, before he died? He used to be pale even when he worked
in the fields. Now he seems as brown as one who has labored in
the earth all day in a vineyard beneath the hot sun! (<i>a
pause</i>)</p>

<p>FOURTH GUEST--The whole look of his face has changed. He is
like a stranger from a far land. There is no longer any sorrow in
his eyes. They must have forgotten sorrow in the grave.</p>

<p>FIFTH GUEST--(<i>grumblingly</i>) I thought we were invited
here to eat--and all we do is stand and gape at him!</p>

<p>FOURTH GUEST--(<i>sternly</i>) Be silent! We are waiting for
him to speak.</p>

<p>THIRD GUEST--(<i>impressively</i>) He did speak once. And he
laughed!</p>

<p>ALL THE GUESTS--(<i>amazed and incredulous</i>) Laughed?</p>

<p>THIRD GUEST--(<i>importantly</i>) Laughed! I heard him! It was
a moment after the miracle--</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>her voice, rich with sorrow, exultant now</i>)
Jesus cried, "Lazarus, come forth!" (<i>She kisses his hand. He
makes a slight movement, a stirring in his vision. The Guests
stare. A frightened pause.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFTH GUEST--(<i>nudging the Second--uneasily</i>) Go on with
your story!</p>

<p>THIRD GUEST--Just as he appeared in the opening of the tomb,
wrapped in his shroud--</p>

<p>SECOND GUEST--(<i>excitedly--interrupting</i>) My heart
stopped! I fell on my face! And all the women screamed!
(<i>sceptically</i>) You must have sharp ears to have heard him
laugh in that uproar!</p>

<p>THIRD GUEST--I helped to pry away the stone so I was right
beside him. I found myself kneeling, but between my fingers I
watched Jesus and Lazarus. Jesus looked into his face for what
seemed a long time and suddenly Lazarus said "Yes" as if he were
answering a question in Jesus' eyes.</p>

<p>ALL THE GUESTS--(<i>mystified</i>) Yes? What could he mean by
yes?</p>

<p>THIRD GUEST--Then Jesus smiled sadly but with tenderness, as
one who from a distance of years of sorrow remembers happiness.
And then Lazarus knelt and kissed Jesus' feet and both of them
smiled and Jesus blessed him and called him "My Brother" and went
away; and Lazarus, looking after Him, began to laugh softly like
a man in love with God! Such a laugh I never heard! It made my
ears drunk! It was like wine! And though I was half-dead with
fright I found myself laughing, too!</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>with a beseeching summons</i>) Lazarus, come
forth!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting</i>) Lazarus! Come forth!</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>on either side of the house--echoing the chant</i>)
Come forth! Come forth!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>suddenly in a deep voice--with a wonderful
exultant acceptance in it</i>) Yes! (<i>The Guests in the room,
the Crowds outside all cry out in fear and joy and fall on their
knees.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting exultantly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The stone is taken away!<br>
 The spirit is loosed!<br>
 The soul let go!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>rising and looking around him at everyone and
everything--with an all-embracing love--gently</i>) Yes! (<i>His
family and the Guests in the room now throng about Lazarus to
embrace him. The Crowds of men and women on each side push into
the room to stare at him. He is in the arms of his Mother and
Miriam while his Sisters and Father kiss and press his hands. The
five are half hysterical with relief and joy, sobbing and
laughing.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER--My son is reborn to me!</p>

<p>CHORUS--Hosannah!</p>

<p>ALL--(<i>with a great shout</i>) Hosannah!</p>

<p>FATHER--Let us rejoice! Eat and drink! Draw up your chairs,
friends! Music! Bring wine! (<i>Music begins in the room off
right, rear--a festive dance tune. The company sit down in their
places, the Father and Mother at Lazarus' right and left, Miriam
next to the Mother, Martha and Mary beside the Father. But
Lazarus remains standing. And the Chorus of Old Men remain in
their formation at the rear. Wine is poured and all raise their
goblets toward Lazarus--then suddenly they stop, the music dies
out, and an awed and frightened stillness prevails, for Lazarus
is a strange, majestic figure whose understanding smile seems
terrible and enigmatic to them.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER--(<i>pathetically uneasy</i>) You frighten us, my son.
You are strange--standing there--(<i>In the midst of a silence
more awkward than before he rises to his feet, goblet in
hand--forcing his voice, falteringly</i>) A toast, neighbors!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>in a forced echo</i>) A toast!</p>

<p>ALL--(<i>echoing them</i>) A toast!</p>

<p>FATHER--To my son, Lazarus, whom a blessed miracle has brought
back from death!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>suddenly laughing softly out of his vision, as if
to himself, and speaking with a strange unearthly calm in a voice
that is like a loving whisper of hope and confidence</i>) No!
There is no death! (<i>A moment's pause. The people remain with
goblets uplifted, staring at him. Then all repeat after him
questioningly and frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p>ALL--There--is--no--death?</p>

<p>SIXTH GUEST--(<i>suddenly blurts out the question which is in
the minds of all</i>) What did you find beyond there, Lazarus?
(<i>a pause of silence</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiles gently and speaks as if to a group of
inquisitive children</i>) O Curious Greedy Ones, is not one world
in which you know not how to live enough for you?</p>

<p>SIXTH GUEST--(<i>emboldened</i>) Why did you say yes,
Lazarus?</p>

<p>FOURTH GUEST--Why did you laugh?</p>

<p>ALL THE GUESTS--(<i>with insistent curiosity but in low awed
tones</i>) What is beyond there, Lazarus?</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>in a low murmur</i>) What is beyond there? What is
beyond?</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>carrying the question falteringly back into
silence</i>) What is beyond?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>suddenly again--now in a voice of loving
exaltation</i>) There is only life! I heard the heart of Jesus
laughing in my heart; "There is Eternal Life in No," it said,
"and there is the same Eternal Life in Yes! Death is the fear
between!" And my heart reborn to love of life cried "Yes!" and I
laughed in the laughter of God! (<i>He begins to laugh, softly at
first--a laugh so full of a complete acceptance of life, a
profound assertion of joy in living, so devoid of all
self-consciousness or fear, that it is like a great bird song
triumphant in depths of sky, proud and powerful, infectious with
love, casting on the listener an enthralling spell. The Crowd in
the room are caught by it. Glancing sideways at one another,
smiling foolishly and self-consciously, at first they hesitate,
plainly holding themselves in for fear of what the next one will
think.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>in a chanting murmur</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lazarus laughs!<br>
 Our hearts grow happy!<br>
 Laughter like music!<br>
 The wind laughs!<br>
 The sea laughs!<br>
 Spring laughs from the earth!<br>
 Summer laughs in the air!<br>
 Lazarus laughs!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>on a final note of compelling exultation</i>)
Laugh! Laugh with me! Death is dead! Fear is no more! There is
only life! There is only laughter!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting exultingly now</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Laugh with Lazarus!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 There is no death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>They laugh in a rhythmic cadence dominated by the laughter
of Lazarus.</i>)</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>who, gradually, joining in by groups or one by
one--including Lazarus' family with the exception of Miriam, who
does not laugh but watches and listens to his laughter with a
tender smile of being happy in his happiness--have now all begun
to laugh in rhythm with the Chorus--in a great, full-throated
p&aelig;an as the laughter of Lazarus rises higher and
higher</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 There is no death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CHORUS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 There is only life!<br>
 There is only laughter!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>in a rhythmic echo</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!<br>
 There is only laughter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>The room rocks, the air outside throbs with the rhythmic
beat of their liberated laughter--still a bit uncertain of its
freedom, harsh, discordant, frenzied, desperate and drunken, but
dominated and inspired by the high, free, aspiring, exulting
laughter of Lazarus.</i>)</p>

<h2><a name="s102">SCENE TWO</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Some months later. Exterior of Lazarus' home in
Bethany, now known as the House of Laughter. It is a clear bright
night, the sky sparkling with stars. At the extreme front is a
road. Between this and the house is a small raised terrace. The
house is low, of one story only, its walls white. Four windows
are visible with a closed door in the middle of the wall. Steps
lead up to this door, and to the left of door a flight of stairs
goes up to the balustraded roof. The windows shine brilliantly
with the flickering light of many candles which gives them a
throbbing star-like effect. From within comes the sound of flutes
and dance music. The dancers can be seen whirling swiftly by the
windows. There is continually an overtone of singing laughter
emphasizing the pulsing rhythm of the dance.</i></p>

<p><i>On the road in the foreground, at left and right, two
separate groups of Jews are gathered. They are not divided
according to sex as in the previous scene. Each is composed about
equally of men and women, forty-nine in each, masked and costumed
as before. It is religious belief that now divides them. The
adherents of Jesus,</i> <i>the Nazarenes, among whom may be noted
Martha and Mary, are on the left; the Orthodox, among whom are
Lazarus' Father and Mother and a Priest, are at right. Between
the two hostile groups is the same Chorus of Old Men, in a
formation like a spearhead, whose point is placed at the foot of
the steps leading to the terrace. All these people are staring
fascinatedly at the house, listening entranced, their feet
moving, their bodies swaying to the music's beat, stiffly,
constrainedly, compelled against their wills. Then the music
suddenly stops and the chant of youthful voices is heard:</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>FOLLOWERS OF LAZARUS--(<i>from within the house</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 There is only life!<br>
 There is only laughter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>as if they were subjects moved by
hypnotic suggestion--miserably and discordantly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha!<br>
 There is only laughter!<br>
 Ha-ha--</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>in the same manner</i>) Ha-ha--</p>

<p>MARY--Ha--(<i>then frantically--half-weeping with indignant
rage--to the Nazarenes</i>) Stop! Oh, how can we laugh! We are
betraying Jesus! My brother Lazarus has become a devil!</p>

<p>THE ORTHODOX PRIEST--(<i>His mask is that of a religious
fanatic. He is sixty or so.</i>) Ha--ha--(<i>tearing his beard
and stamping with rage</i>) Stop it, you fools! It is a foul sin
in the sight of Jehovah! Why do you come here every night to
listen and watch their abominations? The Lord God will punish
you!</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>echoing him--to her people</i>) Jesus will never
forgive you!</p>

<p>THE PRIEST--(<i>angrily</i>) Jesus? (<i>He turns to look at
the Nazarenes disdainfully and spits on the ground insultingly.
The members of the two groups begin to glare at each other. The
Chorus falls back, three on each side, leaving one neutral figure
before the steps. The Priest goes on tauntingly.</i>) Did you
hear her, friends? These renegade Nazarenes will soon deny they
are Jews at all! They will begin to worship in filthy idolatry
the sun and stars and man's body--as Lazarus in there, (<i>points
to the house</i>) the disciple of their Jesus, has so well set
them the example! (<i>This is followed by an outburst of
insulting shouts of accusation and denial from both
sides.</i>)</p>

<p>A NAZARENE--(<i>the Fourth Guest of Scene One</i>) You lie!
Lazarus is no disciple! He is a traitor to Jesus! We scorn
him!</p>

<p>PRIEST--(<i>sneeringly</i>) But your pretended Messiah did not
scorn him. According to your stupid lies, he raised him from the
dead! And answer me, has your Jesus ever denied Lazarus, or
denounced his laughter? No! No doubt he is laughing, too, at all
you credulous fools--for if Lazarus is not his disciple, in the
matter of the false miracle he was his accomplice! (<i>This
provokes a furious protest from the Nazarenes and insulting hoots
and jeers from the Orthodox, penetrated by a piercing scream from
Lazarus' Mother, who, crushed in the crowd, sinks fainting to the
ground. The Father bends over her. The group of the Orthodox
falls back from them. With frightened cries Martha and Mary run
from the group of Nazarenes and kneel beside her.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER--(<i>pitifully</i>) Rachel! Darling! Speak to me!</p>

<p>MARTHA--(<i>practically</i>) She has only fainted.</p>

<p>MARY--She is opening her eyes! Mother, dear!</p>

<p>MOTHER--(<i>weakly</i>) Did I fall? (<i>recognizing Martha and
Mary</i>) Martha--and Mary--my dear ones! (<i>They embrace her,
weeping.</i>) I have not kissed you since you left home to follow
that Jesus--Oh, if we were only at home again--and if, also, my
poor boy, Lazarus--(<i>She sobs.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER--(<i>gruffly</i>) You must not speak of him!</p>

<p>MARTHA--Do not worry your head about Lazarus. He is not worth
it!</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>with surprising vindictiveness</i>) He is accursed!
He has betrayed our Lord!</p>

<p>PRIEST--(<i>to those around him--mockingly</i>) Do you hear?
They already call the Nazarene "Lord!" A Lord who is in the
common prison at Jerusalem, I heard today! A fine Lord whom our
High Priests have had arrested like a thief!</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>with fanatic fervor</i>) He is a king! Whenever He
chooses He will gather a great army and He will seize His kingdom
and all who deny Him shall be crucified!</p>

<p>PRIEST--(<i>tauntingly</i>) Now their jail-bird is a king, no
less! Soon they will make him a god, as the Romans do their
C&aelig;sars!</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>her eyes flashing</i>) He is the Messiah!</p>

<p>PRIEST--(<i>furiously</i>) The Messiah! May Jehovah smite you
in your lies! Step back among your kind! You defile us! (<i>As
she stands defiantly he appeals to the Father.</i>) Have you no
authority? She called him the Messiah--that common beggar, that
tramp! Curse her!</p>

<p>FATHER--(<i>confused, pitifully harried, collecting his
forces</i>) Wait! Go back, Mary! You chose to follow that
impostor--</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>defiantly</i>) The Messiah!</p>

<p>MARTHA--(<i>trying to calm her</i>) Ssssh! Remember he is our
father!</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>fanatically</i>) I deny him! I deny all who deny
Jesus!</p>

<p>MOTHER--(<i>tearfully</i>) And me, darling?</p>

<p>MARY--You must come to us, Mother! You must believe in Jesus
and leave all to follow Him!</p>

<p>FATHER--(<i>enraged</i>) So! You want to steal your mother
away, to leave me lonely in my old age! You are an unnatural
daughter! I disown you! Go, before I curse--</p>

<p>MOTHER--(<i>beseechingly</i>) Father!</p>

<p>MARTHA--(<i>pulling Mary away</i>) Mary! Jesus teaches to be
kind.</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>hysterically</i>) He teaches to give up all and
follow Him! I want to give Him everything! I want my father to
curse me!</p>

<p>FATHER--(<i>frenziedly</i>) Then I do curse you! No--not
you--but the devil in you! And the devil in Martha! And the great
mocking devil that dwells in Lazarus and laughs from his mouth! I
curse these devils and that Prince of Devils, that false prophet,
Jesus! It is he who has brought division to my home and many
homes that were happy before. I curse him! I curse the day he
called my good son, Lazarus, from the grave to walk again with a
devil inside him! It was not my son who came back but a devil! My
son is dead! And you, my daughters, are dead! I am the father
only of devils! (<i>His voice has risen to a wailing lament.</i>)
My children are dead!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>His voice rings from within the house in exultant
denial.</i>) Death is dead! There is only laughter! (<i>He
laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>The voices of all his Followers echo his laughter. They
pour in a laughing rout from the doorway onto the terrace. At the
same moment the Chorus of Followers appears on the roof and forms
along the balustrade, facing front.</i></p>

<p>(<i>These Followers of Lazarus, forty-nine in number, composed
about equally of both sexes, wear a mask that, while recognizably
Jewish, is a Lazarus mask, resembling him in its expression of
fearless faith in life, the mouth shaped by laughter. The Chorus
of Followers, seven in number, all men, have identical masks of
double size, as before. The Period of all these masks is anywhere
between Youth and Manhood [or Womanhood].</i></p>

<p>(<i>The music continues to come from within. Laughing, the
Followers dance to it in weaving patterns on the terrace. They
are dressed in bright-colored diaphanous robes. Their chorused
laughter, now high and clear, now dying to a humming murmur,
stresses the rhythmic flow of the dance.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF FOLLOWERS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 There is no death!<br>
 There is only laughter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FOLLOWERS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is only laughter!<br>
 Death is dead!<br>
 Laugh! Laugh!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>The two groups of Nazarenes and Orthodox, on the
appearance of the Followers, immediately forget their differences
and form into one mob, led by their Chorus of Old Men, whose
jeering howls they echo as one voice.</i>) Yaah! Yaah! Yaah!
(<i>But they cannot keep it up. The music and laughter rise above
their hooting. They fall into silence. Then they again begin to
feel impelled by the rhythm and laughter, their feet move, their
bodies sway. Their lips quiver, their mouths open as if to laugh.
Their Chorus of Old Men are the first to be affected. It is as if
this reaction were transmitted through the Chorus to the
Crowd.</i>)</p>

<p>PRIEST--(<i>his mouth twitching--fighting against the
compulsion in him--stammers</i>) Brothers--listen--we must
unite--in one cause--to--stamp out--this abomination! (<i>It is
as if he can no longer control his speech. He presses his hand
over his mouth convulsively.</i>)</p>

<p>AN AGED ORTHODOX JEW--(<i>the Seventh Guest of Scene
One--starts to harangue the crowd. He fights the spell but cannot
control his jerking body nor his ghastly, spasmodic
laughter.</i>) Neighbors! Our young people are corrupted! They
are leaving our farms--to dance and sing! To laugh! Ha--! Laugh
at everything! Ha-ha--! (<i>He struggles desperately to control
himself.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>a barking laugh forced from them</i>)
Ha-ha--!</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>echoing this</i>) Ha-ha--!</p>

<p>THE AGED JEW--They have no respect for life! When I said in
kindness, "You must go back to work," they laughed at me! Ha--!
"We desire joy. We go to Lazarus," they said--and left my fields!
I begged them to stay--with tears in my eyes! I even offered them
more money! They laughed! "What is money? Can the heart eat
gold?" They laughed at money! Ha-ha--! (<i>He chokes with
exasperated rage.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>echoing him</i>) Ha-ha--!</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>echoing the Chorus</i>) Ha-ha--!</p>

<p>AGED JEW--(<i>shaking his fist at Lazarus' Followers</i>) That
loafer taught them that! They come to him and work for nothing!
For nothing! And they are glad, these undutiful ones! While they
sow, they dance! They sing to the earth when they are plowing!
They tend his flocks and laugh toward the sun! Ha-ha-ha--! (<i>He
struggles again.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>as before</i>) Ha-ha-ha--</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>as before</i>) Ha-ha-ha--</p>

<p>AGED JEW--How can we compete with labor for laughter! We will
have no harvest. There will be no food! Our children will starve!
Our race will perish! And he will laugh! Ha-ha-ha-ha! (<i>He
howls with furious, uncontained laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>echoing his tone</i>) Our children will
starve! Our race will perish! Lazarus laughs! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>as before</i>) Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha! (<i>Their
former distinctions of Nazarenes and Orthodox are now entirely
forgotten. The members of Lazarus' family are grouped in the
center as if nothing had ever happened to separate them. The
Chorus of Old Men is again joined in its spearhead formation</i>
<i>at the stairs. Apparent first in this Chorus, a queer
excitement begins to pervade this mob. They begin to weave in and
out, clasping each other's hands now and then, moving
mechanically in jerky steps to the music in a grotesque sort of
marionettes' country dance. At first this is slow but it
momentarily becomes more hectic and peculiar. They raise clenched
fists or hands distended into threatening talons. Their voices
sound thick and harsh and animal-like with anger as they mutter
and growl, each one aloud to himself or herself.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>threateningly, gradually rising to
hatred</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hear them laugh!<br>
 See them dance!<br>
 Shameless! Wanton!<br>
 Dirty! Evil!<br>
 Infamous! Bestial!<br>
 Madness! Blood!<br>
 Adultery! Murder!<br>
 We burn!<br>
 We kill!<br>
 We crucify!<br>
 Death! Death!<br>
 Beware, Lazarus!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>this last in a wild frenzy</i>)</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>frenziedly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beware, Lazarus!<br>
 We burn! We kill!<br>
 We crucify!<br>
 Death! Death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>They crowd toward the gateway, their arms stretched out as
if demanding Lazarus for a sacrificial victim. Meanwhile they
never cease to hop up and down, to mill around, to twist their
bodies toward and away from each other in bestial parody of the
dance of the Followers.</i></p>

<p>(<i>The tall figure of Lazarus, dressed in a white robe,
suddenly appears on the roof of the house. He stands at the
balustrade in the middle of the Chorus. Beside him, a little
behind, Miriam appears dressed in black, her face upturned, her
lips praying. She appears to have grown older, to be forty now.
Lazarus' body is softly illumined by its inner light. The change
in him is marked. He</i> s<i>eems ten years younger, at the prime
of forty. His body has become less angular and stiff. His
movements are graceful and pliant. The change is even more
noticeable in his face, which has filled out, become purer in
outline, more distinctly Grecian. His complexion is the red-brown
of rich earth, the gray in his black, curly beard has almost
disappeared.</i></p>

<p>(<i>He makes a sign and the music ceases. His Followers remain
fixed in their dancing attitudes like figures in a frieze. Each
member of the mob remains frozen in a distorted posture. He
stares down at the mob pityingly, his face calm.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>speaks amid a profound silence. His voice
releases his own dancers and the mob from their fixed attitudes.
The music begins to play again within the house, very soft and
barely audible, swelling up and down like the sound of an organ
from a distant church.</i>) You laugh, but your laughter is
guilty! It laughs a hyena laughter, spotted, howling its hungry
fear of life! That day I returned did I not tell you your fear
was no more, that there is no death? You believed then--for a
moment! You laughed--discordantly, hoarsely, but with a groping
toward joy. What! Have you so soon forgotten, that now your
laughter curses life again as of old? (<i>He pauses--then
sadly</i>) That is your tragedy! You forget! You forget the God
in you! You wish to forget! Remembrance would imply the high duty
to live as a son of God--generously!--with love!--with
pride!--with laughter! This is too glorious a victory for you,
too terrible a loneliness! Easier to forget, to become only a
man, the son of a woman, to hide from life against her breast, to
whimper your fear to her resigned heart and be comforted by her
resignation! To live by denying life! (<i>then exhortingly</i>)
Why are your eyes always either fixed on the ground in weariness
of thought, or watching one another with suspicion? Throw your
gaze upward! To Eternal Life! To the fearless and deathless! The
everlasting! To the stars! (<i>He stretches out his arms to the
sky--then suddenly points.</i>) See! A new star has appeared! It
is the one that shone over Bethlehem! (<i>His voice becomes a
little bitter and mocking.</i>) The Master of Peace and Love has
departed this earth. Let all stars be for you henceforth symbols
of Saviors--Sons of God who appeared on worlds like ours to tell
the saving truth to ears like yours, inexorably deaf! (<i>then
exaltedly</i>) But the greatness of Saviors is that they may not
save! The greatness of Man is that no god can save him--until he
becomes a god! (<i>He stares up at the stars, rapt in
contemplation, oblivious to all around him now.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Rapidly approaching from the left a man's voice jarring in
high-pitched cruel laughter is heard. They all listen, huddled
together like sheep.</i>)</p>

<p>MESSENGER--(<i>The Third Guest of Scene One rushes in
breathlessly, shouting</i>) The Nazarene has been crucified!</p>

<p>PRIEST--(<i>with fierce triumph</i>) Jehovah is avenged!
Hosannah!</p>

<p>ORTHODOX--Hosannah! The false prophet is dead! The pretended
Messiah is dead! (<i>They jump and dance, embracing one another.
The Nazarenes stand paralyzed and stunned. The two groups
mechanically separate to right and left again, the Chorus of Old
Men dividing itself as before.</i>)</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>in a frenzy of grief</i>) Do not believe him! Jesus
could not die! (<i>But at this moment a Nazarene youth, exhausted
by grief and tears, staggers in from the left.</i>)</p>

<p>MESSENGER--(<i>Second Guest of Scene One</i>) Jesus is dead!
Our Lord is murdered! (<i>He sinks on his knees sobbing. All the
Nazarenes do likewise, wailing, rending their garments, tearing
their hair, some even beating their heads on the ground in the
agony of their despair.</i>)</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>insane with rage now</i>) They have murdered Him!
(<i>to her Followers--savagely</i>) An eye for an eye! Avenge the
Master! (<i>Their frenzy of grief turned into rage, the Nazarenes
leap to their feet threateningly. Concealed swords and knives are
brought out by both sides.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>leaning over the balustrade--in a voice of
entreaty</i>) Mary! Brothers! (<i>But none heed her or seem to
see her. Lazarus and his Followers remain oblivious to men, arms
up-stretched toward the stars, their heads thrown back.</i>)</p>

<p>MARY--(<i>wildly</i>) Vengeance! Death to His murderers!</p>

<p>PRIEST--(<i>fiercely to his Followers</i>) Death to the
Nazarenes! (<i>With cries of rage the two groups rush on one
another. There is a confused tumult of yells, groans, curses, the
shrieks of women, the sounds of blows as they meet in a pushing,
whirling, struggling mass in which individual figures are
indistinguishable. Knives and swords flash above the heads of the
mass, hands in</i> <i>every tense attitude of striking,
clutching, tearing are seen upraised. As the fight is at its
height a Roman Centurion and a squad of eight Soldiers come
tramping up at the double-quick. They all are masked. These Roman
masks now and henceforth in the play are carried out according to
the same formula of Seven Periods, Seven Types, as those of the
Jews seen previously, except that the basis of each face is
Roman--heavy, domineering, self-complacent, the face of a
confident dominant race. The Centurion differs from his soldiers
only in being more individualized. He is middle-aged, his
soldiers belong to the Period of Manhood. All are of the Simple,
Ignorant Type.</i>)</p>

<p>CENTURION--(<i>shouts commandingly</i>) Disperse! (<i>But no
one hears him--with angry disgust to his Soldiers</i>) Charge!
Cut them down! (<i>The Soldiers form a wedge and charge with a
shout. They soon find it necessary to use their swords, and
strike down everyone in their way.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--Mercy, Romans! (<i>As they pay no attention to her, in
desperation she embraces Lazarus beseechingly, forcing his
attention back to earth.</i>) Lazarus! Mercy!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>looks down upon the struggling mass and cries in
a ringing voice</i>) Hold! (<i>Each person stands transfixed,
frozen in the last movement, even the Roman Soldiers and the
Centurion himself. Ten dead and mortally wounded lie on the
ground, trampled by the feet of friend and foe alike. Lazarus
looks at the Crowd. To each he seems to look at him or her alone.
His eyes are accusing and stern. As one head, the heads of all
are averted. Even the Centurion stares at the ground humbly, in
spite of himself. Finally Lazarus speaks in a voice of infinite
disdain.</i>) Sometimes it is hard to laugh--even <i>at</i> men!
(<i>He turns his eyes from them, staring straight before him.
This seems to release them from their fixed positions. The
Nazarenes and the Orthodox separate and slink guiltily apart. The
Chorus of Old Men forms again, the apex at the center of the
steps as before. A low wail of lamentation arises from them. The
two crowds of Nazarenes and Orthodox echo this.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>in a wailing chant</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Woe unto Israel!<br>
 Woe unto thee, Jerusalem!<br>
 O divided house,<br>
 Thou shalt crumble to dust,<br>
 And swine shall root<br>
 Where thy Temple stood!<br>
 Woe unto us!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>in a great echoing cry</i>) Woe unto us!</p>

<p>CENTURION--(<i>gruffly to hide his embarrassment at being awed
by Lazarus</i>) Here, you! Drag your carcasses away! (<i>From
each side men and women come forward to identify and mourn their
dead. The wail of lamentation rises and falls. The Centurion
looks up at Lazarus--harshly</i>) You, there! Are you he whom
they call the Laugher?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>without looking at him--his voice seeming to come
from some dream within him</i>) I am Lazarus.</p>

<p>CENTURION--Who was brought back from death by enchantment?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>looking down at him now--with a smile,
simply</i>) No. There is no death!</p>

<p>CHORUS OF FOLLOWERS--(<i>chanting joyously</i>) There is no
death!</p>

<p>FOLLOWERS--(<i>echoing</i>) There is no death!</p>

<p>AN ORTHODOX MAN--(<i>bending beside the body of Lazarus'
Father</i>) Here is your father, Lazarus. He is dead.</p>

<p>AN ORTHODOX WOMAN--This is your mother, Lazarus. She is
dead.</p>

<p>A NAZARENE--Here is your sister, Martha, Lazarus. She is
dead.</p>

<p>A NAZARENE WOMAN--And this is Mary, Lazarus. She is dead.</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>suddenly--with deep grief</i>) And Jesus who was
the Son of Man, who loved you and gave you life again has died,
Lazarus--has died!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>in a great triumphant voice</i>) Yes! Yes!!
Yes!!! Men die! Even a Son of Man must die to show men that Man
may live! But there is no death!</p>

<p>CENTURION--(<i>at first in a tone of great awe--to his
Soldiers</i>) Is he a god? (<i>then gruffly, ashamed of his
question</i>) Come down, Jew! I have orders to bring you to Rome
to C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>as if he were answering not the Centurion but the
command of his fate from the sky</i>) Yes! (<i>He walks down the
narrow stairs and, Miriam following him, comes down the path to
the</i> <i>road. He goes and kneels for a moment each beside the
bodies of his Father, Mother, and Sisters and kisses each in turn
on the forehead. For a moment the struggle with his grief can be
seen in his face. Then he looks up to the stars and, as if
answering a question, again says simply and acceptingly</i>) Yes!
(<i>then exultantly</i>) Yes!! (<i>And begins to laugh from the
depths of his exalted spirit. The laughter of his Chorus and then
of his Followers echoes his. The music and dancing begin
again.</i></p>

<p>(<i>The Centurion grins sheepishly. The Soldiers chuckle. The
Centurion laughs awkwardly. The Soldiers laugh. The music from
the house and the laughter of the Followers grow louder. The
infection spreads to the Chorus of Old Men whose swaying grief
falls into the rhythm of the laughter and music as does that of
the mourners.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS' FOLLOWERS--(<i>led by their Chorus</i>) Laugh!
Laugh!</p>

<p>CHORUS OF OLD MEN--(<i>torn by the
conflict--torturedly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ha-ha-ha--<br>
 Woe to us, woe!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>beside the bodies</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Woe to us, woe!<br>
 Ha-ha--!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CENTURION--(<i>laughingly</i>) You are brave, you Laugher!
Remember Tiberius never laughs! And boast not to C&aelig;sar
there is no death, or he will invent a new one for you!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>with a smile</i>) But all death is men's
invention! So laugh! (<i>He laughs and the Centurion and Soldiers
laugh with him, half dancing clumsily now to the beat of the
music.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF LAZARUS' FOLLOWERS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 There is no death!<br>

crowd grouped around the bodies but forgetting them</i>)</p>

 Death is dead!<br>
 Laugh!</p>

<p>CROWD--</p>

<p>CENTURION--(<i>laughing, to his laughing Soldiers</i>)
Forward! (<i>They tramp, dancing, off. Lazarus and Miriam start
to follow.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>suddenly pointing to his Followers who are dancing
and laughing obliviously--pityingly</i>) But your faithful ones
who love you, Lazarus?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>simply, with a trace of a sad sternness</i>) This
is their test. Their love must remember--or it must forget. Come!
(<i>With a last gesture back like a blessing on all he is
leaving, he goes. The laughter of the Soldiers recedes. That of
the Chorus of Old Men and of the Crowd falters and breaks into
lamenting grief again, guilt-stricken because of its
laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>The music and dancing and voices cease. The lights in the
windows, which have been growing dim, go out. There is a
second</i> <i>of complete, death-like silence. The mourning folk
in the foreground are frozen figures of grief. Then a sudden
swelling chorus of forlorn bewilderment, a cry of lost children
comes from the Chorus of Followers and the Followers themselves.

stretch their arms out in every direction
supplicatingly.</i>)</p>

<h2>SCENE ONE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Some months later. A square in Athens about ten
o'clock at night. In the rear, pure and beautiful in the light of
a full moon, is the fa&ccedil;ade of a temple. An excited crowd
of Greeks of both sexes is gathered in the square as if for some
public festival. They are masked according to the scheme of Seven
Periods in Seven Types of Character for each sex. Here, of
course, the foundation of the mask is the Grecian type of
face.</i></p>

<p><i>On the left, the Chorus of Greeks is grouped, seven in
number, facing front, in the spearhead formation. As before the
Chorus wears masks double the life size of the Crowd masks. They
are all of the Proud Self-Reliant type, in the period of Young
Manhood.</i></p>

<p><i>These seven are clad in goat skins, their tanned bodies and
masks daubed and stained with wine lees, in imitation of the old
followers of Dionysus. Rumor has led them to hope and believe
that Lazarus may be the reincarnation of this deity.</i></p>

<p><i>The people in the crowd are holding themselves in restraint
with difficulty, they stir and push about restlessly with an
eager curiosity and impatience. All eyes are fixed off
left.</i></p>

<p><i>A buzz of voices hums in the air.</i></p>

<p><i>Acting as police, a number of Roman legionaries</i>
(<i>masked like the soldiers of Scene Two</i>) <i>armed with
staves, keep back the crowd from the line of the street that runs
from left to right, front. They resent this duty, which has
already kept them there a long time, and are surly and
quick-tempered with the Greeks.</i></p>

<p><i>At front, pacing impatiently up and down, is a young Roman
noble of twenty-one, clad richly, wearing beautifully wrought
armor and helmet. This is Gaius, the heir of Tiberius
C&aelig;sar, nicknamed Caligula by the soldiers in whose
encampments he was born and where he spent his childhood. His
body is bony and angular, almost malformed, with wide, powerful
shoulders and long arms and hands, and short, skinny, hairy legs
like an ape's. He wears a half-mask of crimson, dark with a
purplish tinge, that covers the upper part of his face to below
the nose. This mask accentuates his bulging, prematurely wrinkled
forehead, his hollow temples and his bulbous, sensual nose. His
large troubled eyes, of a glazed greenish-blue, glare out with a
shifty feverish suspicion at everyone. Below his mask his own
skin is of an anemic transparent pallor. Above it, his hair is
the curly blond hair of a child of six or seven. His mouth also
is childish, the red lips soft and feminine in outline. Their
expression is spoiled, petulant and self-obsessed, weak but
domineering. In combination with the rest of the face there is an
appalling morbid significance to his mouth. One feels that its
boyish cruelty, encouraged as a manly attribute in the coarse
brutality of camps, has long ago become na&iuml;vely insensitive
to any human suffering but its own.</i></p>

<p><i>Walking with Caligula is Cneius Crassus, a Roman general--a
squat, muscular man of sixty, his mask that of a heavy battered
face full of coarse humor.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHORUS OF GREEKS--(<i>intoning solemnly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon the God comes!<br>
 Redeemer and Savior!<br>
 Dionysus, Son of Man and a God!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GREEK CROWD--(<i>echoing</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon the God comes<br>
 Redeemer and Savior!<br>
 Dionysus!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FIRST GREEK--They say an unearthly flame burns in this
Lazarus!</p>

<p>SECOND GREEK--The sacred fire! He must be the Fire-born, the
son of Zeus!</p>

<p>THIRD GREEK--Many who have seen him swear he is Dionysus,
rearisen from Hades!</p>

<p>FOURTH GREEK--(<i>importantly</i>) I saw Lazarus at Antioch
where the galley on which they were taking him to Rome had been
thrice blown back by a storm. Fear of this warning omen is why
they now march with him by land.</p>

<p>FIRST GREEK--Does he truly resemble a god?</p>

<p>FOURTH GREEK--(<i>impressively</i>) One look in his eyes while
his laughter sings in your ears and you forget sorrow! You dance!
You laugh! It is as if a heavy weight you had been carrying all
your life without knowing it suddenly were lifted. You are like a
cloud, you can fly, your mind reels with laughter, you are drunk
with joy! (<i>solemnly</i>) Take my word for it, he is indeed a
god. Everywhere the people have acclaimed him. He heals the sick,
he raises the dead, by laughter.</p>

<p>SEVENTH GREEK--But I have heard that when he has gone people
cannot remember his laughter, that the dead are dead again and
the sick die, and the sad grow more sorrowful.</p>

<p>FIFTH GREEK--Well, we shall soon see with our own eyes. But
why should the God return in the body of a Jew?</p>

<p>SIXTH GREEK--What better disguise if he wishes to remain
unknown? The fools of Romans will never suspect him!</p>

<p>THIRD GREEK--(<i>laughing</i>) Never! They are beginning to
claim he is a Roman!</p>

<p>FIFTH GREEK--So much the better! He will be in their
confidence!</p>

<p>FOURTH GREEK--He will lead us against Rome! He will laugh our
tyrants into the sea! Ha! (<i>He turns toward the Romans and
laughs sneeringly. This is taken up by the Crowd--unpleasant,
resentful laughter. They push forward aggressively and almost
sweep the Soldiers from their feet.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>angrily</i>) Drive them back!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>suddenly with a distorted warped smile</i>)
Order them to use their swords, Cneius. Let the scum look at
their dead and learn respect for us!</p>

<p>SOLDIERS--(<i>shoving and whacking</i>) Back! Step back! Back
there! (<i>The Crowd push back to their former line. There are
muttered curses, groans, protests, which subside into the former
hum of expectancy.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with the same smile</i>) The sword, my old
hyena! Corpses are so educational!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>surlily</i>) I would like to, I promise you! When
I see how they hate us--!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>carelessly</i>) Let them hate--so long as they
fear us! We must keep death dangling (<i>he makes the gesture of
doing so</i>) before their eyes! (<i>He gives a soft, cruel
laugh.</i>) Will you not sacrifice in my honor? What are a few
Greeks? (<i>queerly</i>) I like to watch men die.</p>

<p>CRASSUS--I dare not, Caligula. C&aelig;sar has forbidden
bloodshed.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--Tiberius is a miser. He wants to hoard all of death
for his own pleasure! (<i>He laughs again.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>with rough familiarity</i>) I wager no one will
make that complaint against you when you are C&aelig;sar! (<i>He
chuckles.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with the sudden grandiose posturing of a bad
actor unintentionally burlesquing grandeur</i>) When I, Gaius
Caligula, am C&aelig;sar, I--(<i>then superstitiously looking up
at the sky with cringing foreboding</i>) But it brings bad luck
to anticipate fate. (<i>He takes off his helmet and spits in
it--then with a grim smile</i>) The heirs of a C&aelig;sar take
sick so mysteriously! Even with you who used to ride me on your
knee, I do not eat nor drink until you have tasted first.</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>nodding approvingly</i>) You are sensible. I
suppose I, too, have my price--if they were only clever enough to
discover it! (<i>He laughs hoarsely.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>steps back from him with an uneasy shudder</i>)
You are honest, at least--too honest, Cneius! (<i>grimly</i>) If
my father Germanicus had had you for his counselor, he might have
escaped their poison. (<i>then gloomily</i>) I must fear
everyone. The world is my enemy.</p>

<p>CRASSUS--Kill it then! (<i>He laughs again.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>stretching out their arms in the direction from
which Lazarus is expected--supplicatingly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Son of the Lightning!<br>
 Deadly thy vengeance!<br>
 Swift thy deliverance!<br>
 Beholding thy Mother,<br>
 Greece, our Mother,<br>
 Her beauty in bondage,<br>
 Her pride in chains!<br>
 Hasten, Redeemer!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>as before--echoing the chant</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hasten, Redeemer!<br>
 Son of the Lightning!<br>
 Deadly thy vengeance!<br>
 Swift thy deliverance!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>disdainfully</i>) What clods! Mob is the same
everywhere, eager to worship any new charlatan! They have already
convinced themselves this Lazarus is a reincarnation of Dionysus!
A Jew become a god! By the breasts of Venus that <i>is</i> a
miracle! (<i>He laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>seriously</i>) But he must be expert in magic. He
was buried four days and came out unharmed. Maybe he is not a
Jew. Some say his father was really a legionary of our garrison
in Judea. And he teaches people to laugh at death. That smacks of
Roman blood!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>ironically</i>) Better still! He tells them
there is no death at all! Hence the multitude of fools who have
acclaimed him everywhere since he left his own country--and why
Tiberius has begun to fear his influence.</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>sententiously</i>) Whom C&aelig;sar
fears--disappears!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--Yes, the dupes who follow Lazarus will be killed.
But Tiberius believes this Lazarus may know a cure for death or
for renewing youth, and the old lecher hopes he can worm the
secret out of him--before he kills him. (<i>He laughs ironically,
then disgustedly</i>) That is why I must escort this Jew to
Rome--as a special honor! (<i>with fierce, haughty
resentment</i>) I, the heir of C&aelig;sar! (<i>savagely</i>) Oh,
if I were C&aelig;sar--!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>with a coarse, meaning smirk</i>) Patience.
Tiberius is old.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>suddenly becoming terribly uneasy at some
thought</i>) Cneius! What if this Lazarus has really discovered a
cure for old age and should reveal it to Tiberius! (<i>His lips
tremble, his eyes are terrified, he shrinks against Crassus for
protection--with boyish pleading</i>) Oh, Cneius, what could I do
then?</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>matter-of-factly</i>) Kill him before C&aelig;sar
can talk to him.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>almost in tears</i>) But if he knows a charm
against death how could he be slain, old fool?</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>gruffly</i>) Bah! (<i>then with grim humor</i>)
Death in bed I suspect, but when men are killed I know they stay
dead! (<i>disgustedly</i>) A moment ago you were laughing at him!
(<i>scornfully</i>) Do you fear him now?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>rather shamefacedly pulls himself together--then
broodingly</i>) I fear everyone who lives. Even you. As you
advised me. (<i>He turns away.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>contemptuously</i>) Well, maybe he can teach you
to laugh at fear. You would welcome him then, eh, cry baby?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with sudden passionate intensity but only half
aloud as if to himself</i>) I would love him, Cneius! As a
father! As a god! (<i>He stands staring before him strangely.
There is a new stir from the Crowd who again push
forward.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>pointing off right</i>) Look! I see a great
crowd! Your Lazarus must be coming at last!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting in a deep, rhythmic monotone like the
rising and falling cadences of waves on a beach</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He comes, the Redeemer and Savior!<br>
 Laughing along the mountains!<br>
 To give back our lost laughter<br>
 To raise from the dead our freedom<br>
 To free us from Rome!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>echoing this chant</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fire-born! Redeemer! Savior!<br>
 Raise from the dead our freedom!<br>
 Give back our lost laughter!<br>
 Free us from Rome!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>They have been pushing forward, more and more fiercely and
defiantly. The Roman Soldiers in spite of their efforts are
pushed backward step by step.</i>)</p>

<p>SOLDIERS--(<i>angrily</i>) Back! Back! (<i>The Soldiers work
with a will, dealing out blows with their staves at everyone in
reach. But now these blows seem only to infuriate the Crowd which
steadily pushes them back into the street. At the same time the
distant sound of exultant music, singing and laughter becomes
steadily louder. Both Soldiers and Crowd are inspired to battle
by these strains without their knowing it. Caligula is listening
spell-bound, his mouth open, his body swaying and twitching. Even
Crassus stares off at the oncomers, forgetful of the growing
plight of his Soldiers.</i>)</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>led by their Chorus--angrily</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cowards! Pigs!<br>
 Strike! Hit!<br>
 Stones! Knives!<br>
 Stab! Kill!<br>
 Death to the Romans!<br>
 Death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A SOLDIER--(<i>alarmed, calls to Crassus</i>) General! Let us
use our swords!</p>

<p>SOLDIERS--(<i>enraged--eagerly</i>) Yes! Swords!</p>

<p>CROWD--Death!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>turning--uneasy but afraid to give any drastic
order</i>) Bah! Staves are enough. Crack their skulls!</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>led by the Chorus--defiantly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Death to Crassus!<br>
 Drunkard! Coward!<br>
 Death to him!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>They continue to push forward, hooting and
jeering.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>exploding for a second</i>) By the gods--! (<i>to
the Soldiers</i>) Draw your swords! (<i>The troops do so eagerly.
The Crowd sag back momentarily with exclamations of
fear.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>listening as in a trance to the music and what
is going on behind him--in a queer whisper</i>) Kill, Cneius! Let
me dance! Let me sing! (<i>The music and crashing of cymbals and
the ferment of passions around him cause him to lose all control
over himself. He gives a crazy leap in the air and begins to
dance grotesquely and chant in a thick voice.</i>) He is coming!
Death, the Deliverer! Kill, soldiers! I command you! I, Caligula!
I will be C&aelig;sar! Death!</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>led by the Chorus--savage now</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beast! Cur!<br>
 Death to Caligula!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>They crowd forward.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>drawing his sword and flourishing it
drunkenly--his eyes glazed</i>) Death!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>drawing his own sword in a frenzy</i>) Strike!
Death! (<i>His Soldiers raise their swords. The Crowd have raised
whatever weapons they have found--knives, clubs, daggers, stones,
bare fists.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting fiercely</i>) Death!</p>

<p>ALL--(<i>Romans and Greeks alike as one great voice</i>)
Death! (<i>The chorused word beats down all sound into a stricken
silence. The wild joyous music ceases. The Romans and Greeks seem
to lean back from one another and collect strength to leap
forward. At this moment the voice of Lazarus comes ringing
through the air like a command from the sky.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--There is no death! (<i>The Soldiers and Greeks remain
frozen in their attitudes of murderous hate. Following his words
the laughter of Lazarus is heard, exultant and gaily mocking,
filling them with the sheepish shame of children caught in
mischief. Their hands hang, their arms sink to their sides.
The</i> <i>music starts once more with a triumphant dash of
cymbals, Lazarus' laughter is echoed from the throats of the
multitude of his Followers who now come dancing into the square,
preceded by a band of masked musicians and by their
Chorus.</i></p>

<p>(<i>This Chorus wears, in double size, the laughing mask of
Lazarus' Followers in the same Period and Type as in the
preceding scene, except that here the mask of each member of the
Chorus has a different racial basis--Egyptian, Syrian,
Cappadocian, Lydian, Phrygian, Cilician, Parthian. The Followers
are costumed and masked as in the preceding scene, seven Types in
seven Periods, except that, as in the Chorus, racially there are
many nations represented. All have wreaths of ivy in their hair
and flowers in their hands which they scatter about. They whirl
in between the Soldiers and Crowd, forcing them back from each
other, teasing them, sifting into the Crowd, their Chorus in a
half circle, confronting the Chorus of Greeks.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF FOLLOWERS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 There is no death!<br>
 There is only life!<br>
 There is only laughter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FOLLOWERS--(<i>echoing</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 There is no death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>Caligula and Crassus are swept to one side, left. Then the
cries and laughter of all become mingled into one
exclamation.</i>)</p>

<p>ALL--Lazarus! Lazarus! (<i>The squad of Roman Soldiers led by
the Centurion, who had taken Lazarus prisoner, march in with
dancers' steps, like a proud guard of honor now, laughing,
pulling a chariot in which Lazarus stands dressed in a tunic of
white and gold, his bronzed face and limbs radiant in the halo of
his own glowing light.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Lazarus now looks less than thirty-five. His countenance
now might well be that of the positive masculine Dionysus,
closest to the soil of the Grecian Gods, a Son of Man, born of a
mortal. Not the coarse, drunken Dionysus, nor the effeminate God,
but Dionysus in his middle period, more comprehensive in his
symbolism, the soul of the recurring seasons, of living and dying
as processes in eternal growth, of the wine of life stirring
forever in the sap and blood and loam of things. Miriam is beside
him, dressed in black, smiling the</i> <i>same sad tender smile,
holding Lazarus' arm as if for protection and in protection. She
appears older, a woman over forty-five.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF GREEKS--(<i>rushing to Lazarus' car</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hail, Dionysus!<br>
 Iacchus!<br>
 Lazarus!<br>
 Hail!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>They surround him, throw over his shoulders and head the
finely dressed hide of a bull with great gilded horns, force into
his right hand the mystic rod of Dionysus with a pine cone on
top, then prostrate themselves.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hail, Savior!<br>
 Redeemer!<br>
 Conqueror of Death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ALL--(<i>in a repeated chorus which finally includes even the
Roman Soldiers, raising their arms to him</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hail, Lazarus!<br>
 Redeemer!<br>
 Hail!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>They are silent. Lazarus looks at them, seeming to see
each and all at the same time, and his laughter, as if in answer
to their greetings, is heard rising from his lips like a
song.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>awed</i>) Look! He is more than man!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>trembling, in a queer agitation</i>) I dare not
look!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--Do you hear his laughter?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>chokingly--puts his hands over his ears</i>) I
will not hear!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--But you must welcome him in C&aelig;sar's name!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>his teeth chattering</i>) I must kill him!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>looking directly at him--gaily mocking</i>) Death
is dead, Caligula! (<i>He begins to laugh again softly.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with an hysterical cry of defiant terror</i>)
You lie! (<i>Sword in hand he whirls to confront Lazarus, but at
the first sight of his face he stops in his tracks, trembling,
held fascinated by Lazarus' eyes, mumbling with a last pitiful
remainder of defiance</i>) But--you lie--whatever you are! I say
there <i>must</i> be death! (<i>The sword has fallen to his side.
He stares open-mouthed at Lazarus. There is something of a shy,
wondering child about his attitude now. Lazarus looks at him,
laughing with gentle understanding. Caligula suddenly drops his
sword and covering</i> <i>his face with his hands weeps like a
boy who has been hurt.</i>) You have murdered my only friend,
Lazarus! Death would have been my slave when I am C&aelig;sar. He
would have been my jester and made me laugh at fear! (<i>He weeps
bitterly.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gaily</i>) Be your own jester instead, O
Caligula! Laugh at yourself, O C&aelig;sar-to-be! (<i>He laughs.
The Crowd now all join in with him.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Caligula suddenly uncovers his face, grins his warped
grin, gives a harsh cackle which cracks through the other
laughter with a splitting discord, cuts a hopping caper like some
grotesque cripple which takes him to the side of Lazarus' chariot
where he squats on his hams and, stretching out his hand, fingers
Lazarus' robe inquisitively and stares up into his face in the
attitude of a chained monkey.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with a childish, mischievous curiosity</i>) Then
if there is no death, O Teacher, tell me why I love to kill?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--Because you fear to die! (<i>then gaily mocking</i>)
But what do you matter, O Deathly-Important One? Put yourself
that question--as a jester! (<i>exultantly</i>) Are you a speck
of dust danced in the wind? Then laugh, dancing! Laugh yes to
your insignificance! Thereby will be born your new greatness! As
Man, Petty Tyrant of Earth, you are a bubble pricked by death
into a void and a mocking silence! But as dust, you are eternal
change, and everlasting growth, and a high note of laughter
soaring through chaos from the deep heart of God! Be proud, O
Dust! Then you may love the stars as equals! (<i>then mockingly
again</i>) And then perhaps you may be brave enough to love even
your fellow men without fear of their vengeance!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>dully</i>) I cannot understand. I hate men. I am
afraid of their poison and their swords and the cringing envy in
their eyes that only yields to fear!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gaily mocking</i>) Tragic is the plight of the
tragedian whose only audience is himself! Life is for each man a
solitary cell whose walls are mirrors. Terrified is Caligula by
the faces he makes! But I tell you to laugh in the mirror, that
seeing your life gay, you may begin to live as a guest, and not
as a condemned one! (<i>raising his hands for silence--with a
playful smile</i>) Listen! In the dark peace of the grave the man
called Lazarus rested. He was still weak, as one who recovers
from a long illness--for, living, he had believed his life a sad
one! (<i>He laughs softly, and softly they all echo his
laughter.</i>) He lay dreaming to the croon of silence, feeling
as the flow of blood in his own veins the past reenter the heart
of God to be renewed by faith into the future. He thought: "Men
call this death"--for he had been dead only a little while and he
still remembered. Then, of a sudden, a strange gay laughter
trembled from his heart as though his life, so long repressed in
him by fear, had found at last its voice and a song for singing.
"Men call this death," it sang. "Men call life death and fear it.
They hide from it in horror. Their lives are spent in hiding.
Their fear becomes their living. They worship life as death!"</p>

<p>CHORUS OF FOLLOWERS--(<i>in a chanting echo</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men call life death and fear it.<br>
 They hide from it in horror.<br>
 Their lives are spent in hiding.<br>
 Their fear becomes their living.<br>
 They worship life as death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LAZARUS--And here the song of Lazarus' life grew pitiful. "Men
must learn to live," it mourned. "Before their fear invented
death they knew, but now they have forgotten. They must be taught
to laugh again!" And Lazarus answered "Yes!" (<i>He now addresses
the Crowd--especially Caligula, directly, laughingly.</i>) Thus
sang his life to Lazarus while he lay dead! Man must learn to
live by laughter! (<i>He laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF FOLLOWERS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 There is only life!<br>
 There is only laughter!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CHORUS OF GREEKS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Hail, Dionysus!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 Thou hast conquered death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ALL--(<i>laughing--in a great laughing chorus</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>as to a crowd of children--laughingly</i>) Out
with you! Out into the woods! Upon the hills! Cities are prisons
wherein man locks himself from life. Out with you under the sky!
Are the stars too pure for your sick passions? Is the warm earth
smelling of night too desirous of love for your pale
introspective lusts? Out! Let laughter be your new clean lust and
sanity! So far man has only learned to snicker meanly at his
neighbor! Let a laughing away of self be your new right to live
forever! Cry in your pride, "I am Laughter, which is Life, which
is the Child of God!" (<i>He laughs and again his voice leads and
dominates the rhythmic chorus of theirs. The music and dancing
begin again.</i>)</p>

<p>THE TWO CHORUSES--(<i>chanting in unison</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 There is only God!<br>
 We are His Laughter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ALL--(<i>echoing</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is only God!<br>
 We are His Laughter!<br>
 Laugh! Laugh!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>They take hold of his chariot traces, and as he had come,
in the midst of a happy multitude, now augmented by all the
Greeks, and the Roman Soldiers who had awaited him, dancing,
playing, singing, laughing, he is escorted off. The noise of
their passing recedes. Caligula and Crassus are left in the empty
square, the former squatting on his hams, monkey-wise, and
brooding somberly.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>is swaying and staggering, like a man in a
drunken stupor, in a bewildered, stubborn struggle to control
himself. He stammers after the Soldiers</i>) Ha-ha-ha--Halt!
Halt, I say! No use--they are gone--mutiny--Halt! (<i>He
continues to stumble toward left.</i>) Ha-ha--Stop it, curse you!
Am I laughing? Where am I going? After Lazarus? Thirty years of
discipline and I--Halt, traitor! Remember C&aelig;sar! Remember
Rome! Halt, traitor! (<i>He faints with the violence of his
struggle and falls in a limp heap.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>startled by his fall, terrified, hops to his
feet and snatches up his sword defensively, glancing over his
shoulder and whirling around as if he expected someone to stab
him in the back. Then, forcing a twisted grin of
self-contempt--harshly</i>) Coward! What do I fear--if there is
no death? (<i>As if he had to cut something, he snatches up a
handful of flowers--desperately</i>) You must laugh, Caligula!
(<i>He starts to lop off the flowers from their stems with a
savage intentness.</i>) Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! (<i>Finally,
impatiently, he cuts off all the remaining with one stroke.</i>)
Laugh! (<i>He grinds the petals under his feet and breaks out
into a terrible hysterical giggle.</i>) Ha-ha--</p>

<h2><a name="s202">SCENE TWO</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>A midnight, months later. Immediately inside the
walls of Rome. In the foreground is the portico of a temple
between whose massive columns one looks across a street on a
lower level to the high wall of Rome at the extreme rear. In the
center of the wall is a great metal gate. The night is thick and
oppressive. In the sky overhead lightning flashes and thunder
rumbles and crashes but there is no rain.</i></p>

<p><i>Within the portico on rows of chairs placed on a series of
wide steps which are on each side, members of the Senate are
seated in their white robes. High hanging lamps cast a wan light
over their faces. They are all masked in the Roman mask, refined
in them by nobility of blood but at the same time with strength
degenerated, corrupted by tyranny and debauchery to an exhausted
cynicism. The three periods of Middle Age, Maturity and Old Age
are represented in the types of the Self-Tortured, Introspective;
Proud, Self-Reliant; the Servile, Hypocritical; the Cruel,
Revengeful; and the Resigned, Sorrowful. The Senators are divided
into two groups on each side, thirty in each. Seated in the
middle of the lower of the three high broad stairs that lead to
the level from which the columns rise is the Chorus of Senators,
seven in number, facing front, in double-sized masks of the
Servile, Hypocritical type of Old Age.</i></p>

<p><i>Lazarus, in his robe of white and gold, the aura of light
surrounding his body seeming to glow more brightly than ever,
stands in the rear at the edge of the portico, center, gazing
upward into the pall of sky beyond the wall. His figure appears
in its immobility to be the statue of the god of the temple. Near
him, but to the rear</i> <i>and to the left of him, facing right,
Miriam is kneeling in her black robes, swaying backward and
forward, praying silently with moving lips like a nun who asks
mercy for the sins of the world. She has grown much older, her
hair is gray, her shoulders are bowed.</i></p>

<p><i>On the other side, placed similarly in relation to Lazarus
and facing Miriam, Caligula is squatting on his hams on a sort of
throne-chair of ivory and gold. He is dressed with foppish
richness in extreme bright colors, a victory wreath around his
head. He stares blinkingly and inquisitively at Lazarus, then at
Miriam. He is half-drunk. A large figured goblet of gold is in
his hand. A slave with an amphora of wine crouches on the steps
by his chair. The slave wears a black negroid mask.</i></p>

<p><i>At the opening of the scene there is heard the steady tramp
of departing troops, whose masks, helmets and armored shoulders
can be seen as they pass through the street before Lazarus to the
gate beyond. Finally with a metallic clash the gate is shut
behind them and there is a heavy and oppressive silence in which
only the murmured prayers of Miriam are heard.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHORUS OF THE SENATE--(<i>intones wearily, as if under a
boring compulsion</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Roman Senate<br>
 Is the Roman Senate<br>
 The Mighty Voice<br>
 Of the Roman People<br>
 As long as Rome is Rome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>as if he hadn't heard--sings hoarsely an old
camp song of the Punic Wars, pounding with his goblet</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bold legionary am I!<br>
 March, oh march on!<br>
 A Roman eagle was my daddy,<br>
 My mother was a drunken drabby<br>
 Oh, march on to the wars!<br>
<br>
 Since lived that lady Leda<br>
 March, oh march on!<br>
 Women have loved high-fliers<br>
 And we are eagles of Rome!<br>
 Oh march on to the wars!<br>
<br>
 Comrades, march to the wars!<br>
 There's pretty girls in Carthage<br>
 And wine to swill in Carthage,<br>
 So we must capture Carthage<br>
 And fight for Mother Rome!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>Holds out his goblet to be refilled. There is silence
again. He stares at Lazarus with a somber intentness. He says
thickly</i>) The legions have gone, Lazarus. (<i>Lazarus gives no
evidence of having heard him. Caligula gulps at his wine. The
Senators begin to talk to each other in low voices.</i>)</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--How does that Jew make that light come from
him, I wonder? It is a well-contrived bit of magic.</p>

<p>SECOND SENATOR--What are we waiting for? A messenger came to
me with C&aelig;sar's command that the Senate meet here at
midnight.</p>

<p>THIRD SENATOR--(<i>bored</i>) Some new whim of Tiberius,
naturally--(<i>with a meaning titter</i>)--or rather I should
say, unnaturally!</p>

<p>FOURTH SENATOR--Perhaps C&aelig;sar has decided to abolish our
august body by a massacre in mass!</p>

<p>THIRD SENATOR--(<i>yawning</i>) There was a feast at Cinna's
last night that lasted until this evening. I could welcome my own
murder as an excuse for sleeping!</p>

<p>FIFTH SENATOR--(<i>pompously</i>) Tiberius would not dare harm
the Senate. He may mistreat individual Senators, but the Roman
Senate is the Roman Senate!</p>

<p>CHORUS OF THE SENATE--(<i>as before--wearily as if under a
boring compulsion--intones</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Rome is Rome<br>
 The Senate is the Senate<br>
 The Mighty Voice of the Roman People.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--(<i>with the ghost of a laugh--wearily</i>) The
Senate is an empty name--a pack of degenerate cowards with no
trace of their ancient nobility or courage remaining--that and no
more!</p>

<p>THIRD SENATOR--(<i>flippantly</i>) You are too severe with
yourself, Lucius! (<i>a titter of laughter</i>)</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--(<i>wearily</i>) A degenerate coward. I am, I
confess it. So are you too, Sulpicius--a hundred fold!--whether
you admit it or not. (<i>Sulpicius laughs weakly without taking
offense.</i>)</p>

<p>SIXTH SENATOR--(<i>after a pause--sighing</i>) In truth, the
Senate is not what it used to be. I can remember--</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--Let us forget, if we can! (<i>then
impatiently</i>) What are we doing here?</p>

<p>SECOND SENATOR--I imagine it has something to do with the
followers of this Lazarus encamped outside the wall. Probably the
legions are to butcher them in their sleep.</p>

<p>SEVENTH SENATOR--And what part do we play--official witnesses?
But how can we witness at night and through a wall? (<i>with
bored resignation</i>) Ah well, the moods of Tiberius are
strange, to say the least. But C&aelig;sar is C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>again with bored weariness as before</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hail!<br>
 C&aelig;sar is C&aelig;sar<br>
 The August One<br>
 Prince of the Senate<br>
 Tribune over Tribunes<br>
 Consul of Consuls<br>
 Supreme Pontiff<br>
 Emperor of Rome<br>
 God among Gods<br>
 Hail!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--(<i>after a pause of silence--dryly</i>)
C&aelig;sar is a beast--and a madman!</p>

<p>FIFTH SENATOR--(<i>pompously</i>) Respect, sir! More respect
for C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>THIRD SENATOR--(<i>mockingly</i>) Or caution, Lucius. One of
us might repeat your opinion to him.</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--You would if it would pay you. But all my money
is squandered. My death is worthless to Tiberius. He would not
reward you. Moreover, you would not be revenged on me, for I long
for death.</p>

<p>THIRD SENATOR--(<i>dryly</i>) Your stomach must be out of
order.</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--The times are out of order. But let us change
the subject. Is it true Tiberius has fled to Capri?</p>

<p>FOURTH SENATOR--Yes. He was terrified by the multitude of
laughing idiots who appeared today with that charlatan. (<i>He
points to Lazarus.</i>)</p>

<p>SECOND SENATOR--There are thousands of them outside the wall.
C&aelig;sar refused to let them enter the city. The story is,
this Lazarus was dead four days and then restored himself to life
by magic.</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--I have a mind to question him. (<i>calls as to
a slave</i>) You, there! Jew, turn round! In the name of the
Senate! (<i>Lazarus seems not to hear him. Lucius remarks with a
weary smile</i>) So much for our authority!</p>

<p>SIXTH SENATOR--(<i>with injured dignity</i>) What insolence!
(<i>in a rage</i>) Ho, barbarian cur, turn round! The Senate
commands you! (<i>Lazarus does not seem to hear, but Caligula
turns on them fiercely.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--Silence! Leave him alone! (<i>with insulting
scorn</i>) I, Caligula, command <i>you</i>! (<i>The Senators seem
to shrink back from him in fear, all but Lucius, who answers with
a mocking servility.</i>)</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--At least, grant us the boon to see this
corpse's face, O Gracious Gaius!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>fixing his cruel, burning eyes on
him--softly</i>) I heard you wish for death, Lucius. When I am
C&aelig;sar you shall scream and pray for it!</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR--(<i>dryly and haughtily</i>) You were bred in
camp, Gaius. You should have learned more courage there along
with your coarseness. But accept my gratitude for your warning. I
shall take care to die before you become C&aelig;sar--and life
becomes too idiotic!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>his grin becoming ferocious with cruelty</i>)
No. You are too weak to kill yourself. Look at me, Lucius! I am
imagining what I shall have done to you! (<i>The Senators are now
trembling. Even Lucius cannot repress a shudder of horror at the
face glaring at him. Suddenly Caligula throws the cup from him
and springs to his feet.</i>) What good is wine if it cannot kill
thought? Lazarus! It is time. I must give the signal! The legions
are waiting. It is C&aelig;sar's command that they spare none of
your followers. (<i>He has walked toward Lazarus.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>stretches out her hands to Caligula
imploringly</i>) Mercy! Spare them who are so full of life and
joy!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>harshly</i>) For their joy I will revenge myself
upon them! Mercy? If there is no death, then death is a mercy!
Ask that man! (<i>He points accusingly to Lazarus.</i>) And why
should you plead for them, Jewess? There are few Jews among them.
They are mostly those whom your people call idolaters and would
gladly see murdered.</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>with deep grief</i>) I am a mother of dead
children. I plead for the mothers of those about to die.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>contemptuously</i>) Pah! (<i>He turns from her
and puts his hand on Lazarus' shoulder.</i>) Lazarus! Do you
hear? I must signal to the legions!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>turns. He has grown more youthful. He seems no
more than thirty. His face is exalted and calm and beautiful. His
eyes shine with an unearthly glory. The Senators lean forward in
their seats, fascinated by his face. A low murmur of admiration
comes from them. Lazarus speaks commandingly.</i>) Wait! I will
awaken my beloved ones that their passing may be a symbol to the
world that there is no death! (<i>He turns, throwing back his
head and stretching up his arms, and begins to laugh low and
tenderly, like caressing music at first but gradually gaining in
volume, becoming more and more intense and insistent, finally
ending up on a triumphant, blood-stirring call to that ultimate
attainment in which all prepossession with self is lost in an
ecstatic affirmation of Life. The voices of his Followers from
beyond the wall, at first one by one, then several at a time,
then multitudes, join in his laughter. Even the Senators are
drawn into it. Now every one of these is standing up, stretching
out his arms toward Lazarus, laughing harshly and discordantly
and awkwardly in his attempt to laugh. Terrific flashes of
lightning and crashes of thunder seem a responsive accompaniment
from the heavens to this laughter of thousands which throbs in
beating waves of sound in the air. Mingled with the laughing from
beyond the wall comes the sound of singing and the music of
flutes and cymbals. Miriam has crawled on her knees to the edge
of the portico where her black figure of grief is outlined below
and to the left of Lazarus, her arms raised outward like the arms
of a cross.</i>)</p>

<p>FOLLOWERS OF LAZARUS--(<i>in a great chanting singing
chorus</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 There is only God!<br>
 Life is His Laughter!<br>
 We are His Laughter!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CHORUS OF SENATORS--(<i>taking it up in a tone between
chanting and their old solemn intoning</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Fear is no more!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ALL--(<i>the multitude beyond the wall, all the Senators,
everyone except the never-laughing Miriam and Caligula and the
Men of the Legions</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>in a queer state of mingled exaltation and
fear--hopping restlessly about from foot to foot--shouting</i>)
The signal! Shall I give the signal to kill, Lazarus?</p>

<p>MEN OF THE LEGIONS--(<i>following a brazen trumpet call, are
suddenly heard from beyond the wall beginning to laugh their
hoarse, bass laughter, a deeper note than all the others</i>)
Laugh! Laugh!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>listening--with dismay</i>) I hear the legions,
Lazarus! They are laughing with them! (<i>He cries with a strange
pitifulness and beseeching</i>) You are playing me false,
Lazarus! You are trying to evade death! You are trying to spare
your people! You are small and weak like other men when the test
comes! You give way to pity! Your great laughter becomes pitiful!
(<i>working himself into a rage</i>) You are a traitor, Lazarus!
You betray C&aelig;sar! Have you forgotten I will be C&aelig;sar?
You betray me, Lazarus! (<i>He rushes to the edge and, making a
megaphone of his hands, bellows</i>) You on the wall! Sentry! It
is I, Caligula! Kill! (<i>The brazen trumpets of the Legions
sound from beyond the wall. He springs near Lazarus again, in a
fiendish ecstasy, dancing a hopping grotesque sword dance behind
him, chanting as he does so</i>) Kill! Kill laughter! Kill those
who deny C&aelig;sar! I will be C&aelig;sar! Kill those who deny
Death! I will be Death! My face will be bright with blood! My
laughing face, Lazarus! Laughing because men fear me! My face of
victorious Fear! Look at me! I am laughing, Lazarus! <i>My</i>
laughter! Laughter of Gods and C&aelig;sars! Ha-ha-ha-ha! (<i>He
laughs, his</i> <i>laughter fanatically cruel and savage, forced
from his lips with a desperate, destroying abandon. For a moment,
above all the chorus of other sounds, his voice fights to
overcome that of Lazarus, whose laughter seems now to have
attained the most exultant heights of spiritual affirmation. Then
Caligula's breaks into a cry of fear and a sob, and, casting his
sword aside, he hides his face in his hands and cries
beseechingly</i>) Forgive me! I love you, Lazarus! Forgive me!
(<i>At this second the blaring trumpets of the Legions are heard
approaching and their great bass chorus of marching tramping
laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>MEN OF THE LEGIONS--(<i>chanting</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Fear, no more!<br>
 Death, no more!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>There is now no sound of the singing or the laughter or
music of Lazarus' Followers. Miriam rocks to and fro and raises a
low wail of lamentation. The Senators cheer and shout as at a
triumph.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF SENATORS--(<i>saluting Lazarus</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hail, Victor!<br>
 Hail, Divine One!<br>
 Thou hast slain fear!<br>
 Thou hast slain death!<br>
 Hail! Triumph!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SENATORS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hail! Hail!<br>
 Slayer of Fear!<br>
 Slayer of Death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>The gate in the wall is clanged open. The returning
Legions burst through and gather in a dense mob in the street
below Lazarus, who looks down upon them, silent but smiling
gently now. They stare at him with admiration. Only a sea of
their masks can be seen, their eyes shining exultantly. Crassus,
their general, ascends the steps until he stands a little below
Lazarus. Their Chorus of Legionaries in double-sized masks climb
to the step below Crassus, forming behind him. They are in the
Period of Manhood, of the Simple, Ignorant Type. No weapons can
be seen--only their masks and helmets and armor gleaming in the
lightning flashes and in the flickering light of torches. Their
laughter seems to shake the walls and make the pillars of the
temple dance.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF THE LEGIONS--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fear, no more!<br>
 Death, no more!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LEGIONARIES--(<i>echoing</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>raising his hand</i>) Silence! (<i>They obey. He
turns to Lazarus and bows his head, falling on one knee, raising
his right arm.</i>) Hail!</p>

<p>LEGIONARIES--(<i>as one man--raising their arms</i>) Hail!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>suddenly pushes forward impudently and strikes a
grandiose attitude</i>) I am here, my brave ones! (<i>There is a
roar of mocking laughter from the Legionaries.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>not unkindly</i>) Not you, Little Killer! We hail
the Great Laugher!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>harshly</i>) Have you killed all his
followers?</p>

<p>CRASSUS--No. They died. They did not wait for our attack. They
charged upon us, laughing! They tore our swords away from us,
laughing, and we laughed with them! They stabbed themselves,
dancing as though it were a festival! They died, laughing, in one
another's arms! We laughed, too, with joy because it seemed it
was not they who died but death itself they killed! (<i>He stops
uncertainly, bowing to Lazarus, awkwardly</i>) I do not
understand this. I am a soldier. But there is a god in it
somewhere! For I know they were drunk, and so were we, with a
happiness no mortal ever felt on earth before! And death was
dead! (<i>In a sudden outburst as if he were drunk with
excitement, he takes off his helmet and waves it.</i>) Hail,
Deliverer! Death is dead! We left our swords with them! What
virtue in killing when there is no death? Your foe laughs. The
joke is on you. What a fool's game, eh? One can only laugh! Now
we want peace to laugh in--to laugh at war! Let C&aelig;sars
fight--that is all they are good for--and not much good for
that!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>frenziedly</i>) Silence, impious traitor!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>smiling drunkenly</i>) Shut up, yourself,
camp-brat! Though you were C&aelig;sar this minute I would laugh
at you! Your death is dead! We will make Lazarus C&aelig;sar!
What say you? (<i>He appeals to the Soldiers.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--No!</p>

<p>CHORUS OF THE LEGIONS--(<i>with laughing intoxication</i>)
Hail, Lazarus C&aelig;sar! Hail!</p>

<p>LEGIONARIES--Lazarus C&aelig;sar, hail!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>appealing to Senate</i>) And you, Senators!</p>

<p>CHORUS OF SENATORS--(<i>with the same joyous intoxication as
the Soldiers</i>) Hail, Lazarus C&aelig;sar! Hail!</p>

<p>SENATORS--Lazarus C&aelig;sar, hail!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>piteously</i>) No, Lazarus! Say no for my
sake!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>with gay mockery</i>) What is--C&aelig;sar?
(<i>He begins to laugh with mockery. All except Caligula and
Miriam join in this laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--Ha-ha! What is C&aelig;sar? You are right! You
deserve better from us. A god? How is that? We will build you a
temple, Lazarus, and make you a god!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>laughingly</i>) When men make gods, there is no
God! (<i>He laughs. They all laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>with puzzled good-nature</i>) I do not
understand. But there is a god in it somewhere--a god of peace--a
god of happiness! Perhaps you are already he, eh? Are you? Well,
never mind now, remember our offer. Give us your answer tomorrow.
Good night to you!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>As the Soldiers start to march away behind
Crassus, and the Senators turn to retire, he stops them all for a
moment with a gesture--with a deep earnestness</i>) Wait! When
you awake tomorrow, try to remember! Remember that death is dead!
Remember to laugh!</p>

<p>ALL--(<i>as if taking an oath with one voice</i>) We will
remember, Lazarus!</p>

<p>CRASSUS--(<i>making a sign to the regimental musicians
jovially</i>) And we will laugh! Play there! (<i>The bands crash
out. The Legions tramp away.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF THE LEGIONS--(<i>chanting to the music</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 C&aelig;sar, no more!<br>
 War, no more!<br>
 Wounds, no more!<br>
 Death is dead!<br>
 Dead! Dead! Dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LEGIONARIES--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!<br>
 Dead! Dead! Dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CHORUS OF SENATORS--(<i>following them</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>C&aelig;sar, no more!<br>
 Fear, no more!<br>
 Death, no more!<br>
 Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SENATE--(<i>elated, excited as a crowd of schoolboys going on
a vacation. Marching after them.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>Lazarus, Miriam and Caligula remain.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>with a great yearning</i>) If men would remember!
If they could! (<i>He stares after them compassionately.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>crouching beside Lazarus. Plucks at his robe
humbly.</i>) You will not laugh at C&aelig;sar, Lazarus, will
you--when I am C&aelig;sar? You will not laugh at gods when they
make me a god? (<i>Lazarus does not answer. Caligula forces a
cruel vindictive smile.</i>) I swear you shall not laugh at death
when I am Death! Ha-ha--(<i>He starts to laugh harshly--then
suddenly, terrified, slinks away and sidles off at
right.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>from where she kneels bowed with
grief--brokenly</i>) Those who have just died were like your
children, Lazarus. They believed in you and loved you.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--And I loved them!</p>

<p>MIRIAM--Then how could you laugh when they were dying?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>exultingly</i>) Did they not laugh? That was
their victory and glory! (<i>with more and more of a passionate,
proud exultation</i>) Eye to eye with the Fear of Death, did they
not laugh with scorn? "Death to old Death," they laughed! "Once
as squirming specks we crept from the tides of the sea. Now we
return to the sea! Once as quivering flecks of rhythm we beat
down from the sun. Now we reenter the sun! Cast aside is our
pitiable pretense, our immortal egohood, the holy lantern behind
which cringed our Fear of the Dark! Flung off is that impudent
insult to life's nobility which gibbers: 'I, this Jew, this
Roman, this noble or this slave, must survive in my pettiness
forever!' Away with such cowardice of spirit! We will to die! We
will to change! Laughing we lived with our gift, now with
laughter give we back that gift to become again the Essence of
the Giver! Dying we laugh with the Infinite. We are the Giver and
the Gift! Laughing, we will our own annihilation! Laughing, we
give our lives for Life's sake!" (<i>He laughs up to heaven
ecstatically.</i>) This must Man will as his end and his new
beginning! He must conceive and desire his own passing as a mood
of eternal laughter and cry with pride, "Take back, O God, and
accept in turn a gift from me, my grateful blessing for Your
gift--and see, O God, now I am laughing with You! I am Your
laughter--and You are mine!" (<i>He laughs again, his laughter
dying lingeringly and tenderly on his lips like a strain of music
receding into the silence over still waters.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>with a sigh--meekly</i>) I cannot understand,
Lazarus. (<i>sadly</i>) They were like your children--and they
have died. Must you not mourn for them?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gently</i>) Mourn? When they laughed?</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>sadly</i>) They are gone from us. And their
mothers weep.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>puts his arm around her and raises her to her
feet--tenderly</i>) But God, their Father, laughs! (<i>He kisses
her on the forehead.</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>SCENE ONE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>Some days later--exterior of Tiberius' villa-palace
at Capri. It is about two in the morning of a clear black night.
In the rear, the walls of the villa, which is built entirely of
marble on the brow of a cliff, loom up with a startling clarity
against the sky. The rear foreground is a marble terrace at the
middle of which is a triumphal arch. On each side, leading up to
it, are massive marble columns standing like the mummies of
legionaries at attention. In the exact centre of the arch itself
a cross is set up on which a full grown male lion has been
crucified. A lamp reflecting downward has been fixed at the top
of the cross to light up an inscription placed over the lion's
head. Below the steps to the terrace, in a line facing front, on
each side of the cross, is the Chorus of the Guard in their
double masks and gorgeous uniforms and armor. Their masks are the
same as the Legionary Chorus of the previous scene.</i></p>

<p><i>The windows of the palace glow crimson-purple with the
reflection of many shaded lamps. The sound of music in a strained
theme of that joyless abandon which is vice is heard above a
confused drunken clamor of voices, punctuated by the high,
staccato laughter of women and youths. A squad of the Guard in
the same uniforms as the Chorus, masked as all the Roman Soldiers
previously, enter from the left, front, climbing up from the
beach below. They are commanded by a Centurion, Flavius. His mask
is that of a typical young patrician officer. They are followed
by Lazarus and Miriam. Caligula walks behind, his drawn sword in
his hand. He is in a state of queer conflicting emotion, seeming
to be filled with a nervous dread and terror of everything about
him, while at the same time perversely excited and elated by his
own morbid tension. Lazarus, looking no more than twenty-five,
haloed in his own mystic light, walks in a deep, detached
serenity.</i></p>

<p><i>Miriam, in black, her hair almost white now, her figure
bowed and feeble, seems more than ever a figure of a sad,
resigned mother of the dead. The Soldiers form in line with the
columns.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>FLAVIUS--(<i>saluting Caligula--with an awed glance at
Lazarus</i>) I will announce your coming--(<i>as if in spite of
himself he bows awkwardly to Lazarus</i>)--and that of this man.
C&aelig;sar was not expecting you so soon, I think.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>forcing a light tone</i>) Lazarus laughed and
the galley slaves forgot their fetters and made their oars fly as
if they were bound for the Blessed Isles of Liberty! (<i>then
with an ironic smile</i>) But you need not tell Tiberius that,
good Flavius. Say it was due to my extreme zeal.</p>

<p>FLAVIUS--(<i>smiles with respectful understanding. Caligula
nods in dismissal. Flavius turns to go--apologetically</i>) You
may have to wait. I dare not speak before he questions me.
(<i>Flavius salutes and hastens to the villa, walking under an
arm of the cross unconcernedly without an upward glance. As they
follow him with their eyes Caligula and Miriam see the lion for
the first time. He steps back with a startled exclamation. She
gives a cry of horror and covers her eyes with her hands to shut
out the sight.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>immediately puts his arms around her
protectingly</i>) What is it, Beloved? (<i>She hides her face on
his breast, pointing toward the lion with a trembling
hand.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>pointing--curiously now, but with entire
callousness</i>) This lion they have crucified. Are you
frightened, Jewess? (<i>with a cruel laugh</i>) My grandfather
frequently plants whole orchards of such trees, but usually they
bear human fruit!</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>with a shudder</i>) Monster!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with genuine surprise--turning to her</i>) Who?
Why? (<i>He approaches the cross and stares at it moodily.</i>)
But why did he have it placed here where he knew you must pass?
Tiberius does not go to such pains to frighten women. (<i>His
eyes fasten on the inscription above the lion's head.</i>) Aha! I
see! (<i>He reads</i>) "From the East, land of false gods and
superstition, this lion was brought to Rome to amuse
C&aelig;sar." (<i>A silence. Caligula shrugs his shoulders,
turning away--lightly</i>) A lesson for you, Lazarus. An example
for other lions--not to roar--or laugh--at C&aelig;sar! (<i>He
gives a harsh laugh.</i>) Tiberius must be terribly afraid of
you. (<i>then somberly</i>) You should never have come here. I
would have advised you not to--but what are you to me? My duty,
if I wish to become C&aelig;sar, is to C&aelig;sar. Besides, you
are no fool. Evidently you must desire your own death. Last night
<i>you</i> might have been C&aelig;sar. The legions were
yours.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiling without bitterness--with a sad
comprehension</i>) But this morning the legions had forgotten.
They only remembered--to go out and pick up their swords! They
also pillaged the bodies a little, as their right, believing now
that they had slain them! (<i>this last a bit bitterly</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>tauntingly</i>) The legions did slay them! It
was only by some magician's trick you made them think your
followers killed themselves.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>not answering him--ironically to himself</i>) It
is too soon. Men still need their swords to slash at ghosts in
the dark. Men, those haunted heroes! (<i>He laughs
softly.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>irritably</i>) What are you laughing at?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--At Lazarus when I find him feeling wronged because
men are men! (<i>He laughs again, softly and musically.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>again taunting brutally</i>) You may be in his
place soon! (<i>He points to the lion.</i>) Will you laugh then?
(<i>Miriam gives a cry of terror.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>calmly</i>) Yes. (<i>then humbly, bowing his
head</i>) I will laugh with the pride of a beggar set upon the
throne of Man!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>sneeringly</i>) You boast. (<i>then as Lazarus
does not answer, touching the lion with intentional provoking
brutality</i>) This one from Africa seems almost gone. They do
not last as long as men.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>walks up the steps to the cross and, stretching
to his full height, gently pushes the lion's hair out of its
eyes--tenderly</i>) Poor brother! C&aelig;sar avenges himself on
you because of me. Forgive me your suffering!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with a start backward--with frightened awe</i>)
Gods! He licks your hand! I could swear he smiles--with his last
breath! (<i>then with relief</i>) Now he is dead!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gently</i>) There is no death.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>pointing to the lion</i>) What is that then?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--Your fear of life.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>impatiently</i>) Bah! (<i>then somberly</i>) A
little fear is useful even for lions--or teachers of laughter if
they wish to laugh long! (<i>then with a sudden exasperation</i>)
Escape now, you fool, while there is still time!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>laughing softly</i>) Escape--what?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>in a frenzy</i>) You know, you ass, you lunatic!
Escape death! Death! Death! (<i>to Miriam</i>) You, woman! Talk
to him! Do you want him nailed up like that?</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>with a pitiful cry</i>) Lazarus! Come! Caligula
will help us!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>harshly</i>) You presume, Jewess! I have no wish
to die! (<i>then with his wry smile</i>) But I will turn my
back--and shut my eyes--(<i>He walks away to left.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>beseechingly</i>) Lazarus! I could not bear that
aching hunger of my empty heart if you should die again!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>coming to her--tenderly</i>) I will not leave
you! Believe in me! (<i>He kisses her forehead tenderly.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>after a pause--slowly and lamentingly</i>) I wish
we were home, Lazarus. This Roman world is full of evil. These
skies threaten. These hearts are heavy with hatred. There is a
taint of blood in the air that poisons the breath of the sea.
These columns and arches and thick walls seem waiting to fall, to
crush these rotten men and then to crumble over the bones that
raised them until both are dust. It is a world deadly to your
joy, Lazarus. Its pleasure is a gorging of dirt, its fulfilled
desire a snoring in a sty in the mud among swine. Its will is so
sick that it must kill in order to be aware of life at all. I
wish we were home, Lazarus. I begin to feel horror gnawing at my
breast. I begin to know the torture of the fear of death,
Lazarus--not of my death but of yours--not of the passing of your
man's body but of the going away from me of your laughter which
is to me as my son, my little boy!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>soothing her</i>) Be comforted, Beloved. Your
fear shall never be!</p>

<p>MIRIAM--On the hills near Bethany you might pray at noon and
laugh your boy's laughter in the sun and there would be echoing
laughter from the sky and up from the grass and distantly from
the shining sea. We would adopt children whose parents the Romans
had butchered, and their laughter would be around me in my home
where I cooked and weaved and sang. And in the dawn at your going
out, and in the evening on your return, I would hear in the
hushed air the bleating of sheep and the tinkling of many little
bells and your voice. And my heart would know peace.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>tenderly</i>) Only a little longer! There is
God's laughter on the hills of space, and the happiness of
children, and the soft healing of innumerable dawns and evenings,
and the blessing of peace!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>looks around at Lazarus impatiently. Then he
makes a beckoning gesture to Miriam.</i>) Ssstt! (<i>Wonderingly
she leaves Lazarus' side and follows him. Lazarus remains, his
eyes fixed on the cross, directly in front of it. Caligula speaks
gruffly to Miriam with a sneer.</i>) Jewess, your Lazarus is mad,
I begin to think. (<i>then confusedly but helplessly inquisitive
and confiding--bursting out</i>) What is it troubles me about
him? What makes me dream of him? Why should I--love him, Jewess?
Tell me! You love him, too. I do not understand this. Why,
wherever he goes, is there joy? You heard even the galley slaves
laugh and clank time with their chains! (<i>then with
exasperation</i>) And yet why can I not laugh, Jewess?</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>in a tone of hushed grief</i>) I may not laugh
either. My heart remains a little dead with Lazarus in Bethany.
The miracle could not revive all his old husband's life in my
wife's heart.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>disgustedly</i>) What answer is that to me?
(<i>then brusquely</i>) But I called you to put you on your
guard. (<i>He points.</i>) There is death in there--Tiberius'
death, a kind from which no miracles can recall one! (<i>He
smiles his twisted smile.</i>) Since Lazarus will not help
himself, you must protect him. I will not, for once in there I am
(<i>mockingly</i>) the heir of C&aelig;sar, and you are scum whom
I will kill at his order as I would two beetles! So keep watch!
Taste first of what he eats--even were I the one to give it to
him!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>suddenly laughs softly</i>) Why do you delight in
believing evil of yourself, Caligula?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>flying into a queer rage</i>) You lie! I am what
I am! (<i>with grandiose pride</i>) What could you know of a
C&aelig;sar?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>still laughing with an affectionate
understanding</i>) What--I know! (<i>As he finishes speaking all
the sound of music and voices from the house ceases abruptly and
there is a heavy silence.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>shaking her head and turning away sadly</i>) That
is too far, Lazarus. Let us go home.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>harshly</i>) Sst! Do you hear? Flavius has told
C&aelig;sar. (<i>grimly forcing a harsh snicker</i>) Now we will
soon know--(<i>There is the sudden blaring of a trumpet from
within the palace. A wide door is flung open and a stream of
reddish light comes out against which the black figures of
several men are outlined. The door is shut again quickly. Several
slaves bearing lamps on poles escort the patrician, Marcellus,
forward to the arch. He passes under the crucified lion without a
glance--then stands, cool and disdainful, to look about him. He
is a man of about thirty-five, wearing the type mask of a Roman
patrician to which are added the dissipated courtier's
characteristics of one who leans to evil more through weakness
than any instinctive urge. He is dressed richly. His smile is
hypocritical and his eyes are hard and cold but when they come to
rest on Lazarus he gives a start of genuine
astonishment.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>who has moved to Lazarus' side defensively--in a
quick whisper</i>) Beware of this man, Lazarus! (<i>then
advancing--with a condescending hauteur</i>) Greeting,
Marcellus!</p>

<p>MARCELLUS--(<i>in an ingratiating tone</i>) Greeting, Gaius. I
have a message from C&aelig;sar for the man called Lazarus.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>calmly</i>) I am Lazarus.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS--(<i>makes a deep bow--flatteringly</i>) I had
surmised it, sir. Although I cannot pretend to virtue in myself
at least I may claim the merit of recognizing it in others.
(<i>He advances toward Lazarus, smiling, with one hand kept
hidden beneath his cloak.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>stepping between them--sharply</i>) What is your
message?</p>

<p>MARCELLUS--(<i>surprised--placatingly</i>) I am sorry, Gaius,
but it was C&aelig;sar's command I speak to Lazarus alone.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>fiercely</i>) And then, Marcellus? (<i>Marcellus
shrugs his shoulders and smiles deprecatingly.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>with a compelling dignity</i>) Let him speak.
(<i>inclining his head to Marcellus--strangely</i>) Over here
where it is dark you will not be seen--nor see yourself. (<i>He
walks to the darkness at right.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>turning his back on them, with angry boyish
resentfulness that is close to tears</i>) Idiot! Go and die,
then!</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>with a terrified cry</i>) Lazarus! (<i>She starts
to go to him.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>motioning her to remain where she is--gently</i>)
Believe, Beloved! (<i>He turns his back on them all and stands
waiting.</i>)</p>

<p>MARCELLUS--(<i>stares at Lazarus--then over his shoulder at
Caligula--uncertainly</i>) What does he mean, Gaius? (<i>Then
suddenly putting on a brave front, he strides up behind
Lazarus</i>) C&aelig;sar wished me to bid you welcome, to tell
you how much regard he has for you, but he desired me to ask
whether you propose to laugh here--in C&aelig;sar's palace? He
has heard that you laugh at death--that you have caused others to
laugh--even his legionaries. (<i>A pause, Marcellus remains
behind Lazarus' back, the latter standing like a victim.</i>)
Briefly, C&aelig;sar requires your pledge that you will not
laugh. Will you give it? (<i>He frees his dagger from under his
robe. A pause. Arrogantly</i>) I am waiting! Answer when
C&aelig;sar commands! (<i>then angrily, baffled</i>) I will give
you while I count three--or take your silence as a refusal! One!
Two! Three! (<i>He raises his hand to stab Lazarus in the back.
Miriam stifles a scream. At the same instant, Lazarus begins to
laugh, softly and affectionately. Marcellus stops, frozen in
mid-action, the dagger upraised. Caligula has whirled around and
stands staring, a smile gradually coming to his face. Lazarus
turns, his laughter grown a trifle louder, and faces Marcellus.
The latter steps back from him, staring open-mouthed, fascinated.
His arm sinks to his side. The dagger falls from his fingers. He
smiles back at Lazarus--the curious, sheepish, bashful smile of
one who has fallen in love and been discovered.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>going to him, puts both hands on his shoulders
and looks in his eyes, laughing affectionately--then
quizzically</i>) Here is another one who believes in death! But
soon you will laugh with life! I see it in your eyes. Farewell,
Marcellus! (<i>He turns away from him and walks, laughing, toward
the arch in rear. With bowed head the black-robed figure of
Miriam follows him. Marcellus hides his face in his hands,
half-sobbing, and half-laughing hysterically. Lazarus pauses
before the cross for a moment--raises his hand as if blessing the
dead lion, then passes below it, moving slowly on toward the
palace in the rear. His laughter rises with more and more
summoning power. The files of the Guard, as he passes them, two
by two join in his laughter, saluting him as if in spite of
themselves.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>sidling up to Marcellus, cruel and mocking</i>)
Are you weeping, Marcellus? Laugh at that blundering fool,
yourself! What will C&aelig;sar say? Will he laugh when he has
your body broken one bone at a time with hammers? Why did you not
kill? For shame! A patrician exposed to laughter by a Jew! Poor
craven! Why could you not strike? There <i>must</i> be death!
Coward! Why did you not stab? (<i>then in a queer awed
whisper</i>) I know! Was it not because of a sudden you loved him
and could not?</p>

<p>MARCELLUS--(<i>suddenly--eagerly</i>) Yes! That was it! I
loved him!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>craftily and cruelly</i>) You were about to
murder him!</p>

<p>MARCELLUS--(<i>tortured with remorse</i>) No! No! How could I?
What infamy! (<i>cries tearfully</i>) Forgive me, Lazarus!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with vindictive insistence</i>) Judge yourself!
(<i>He takes up the dagger.</i>) Here is your dagger! Avenge him
on yourself!</p>

<p>MARCELLUS--(<i>trying to laugh</i>) Ha-ha--Yes! (<i>He stabs
himself and falls. Suddenly his laughter is released.</i>) I
laugh! You are a fool, Caligula! There is no death! (<i>He dies,
laughing up at the sky.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>kicks his body with savage cruelty</i>) You lie!
(<i>then suddenly kneels and bends over it imploringly</i>) Tell
me you lie, Marcellus! Do me that mercy!--and when I am
C&aelig;sar, I--(<i>He begins to weep like a frightened boy, his
head in his hands. Meanwhile Lazarus has arrived with Miriam at
the steps before the door of the palace. As he starts to ascend
these, the crimson-purple lights of the many windows of the
palace go out one by one as if fleeing in terror from the
laughter which now beats at the walls.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS OF THE GUARD--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fear, no more!<br>
 Death, no more!<br>
 Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ALL THE GUARDS--(<i>now all in a great chorus, raising their
spears aloft and saluting Lazarus as if they were his own
triumphal body guard</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>Lazarus has ascended the steps. He walks into the black
archway of the darkened palace, his figure radiant and unearthly
in his own light. Miriam follows him. They disappear in the
darkness. There is a pause of dead silence.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>raises his head uneasily, looks back toward the
palace, jumps to his feet in a panic of terror, and runs toward
the palace door, calling</i>) Lazarus! Wait! I will defend you!
There is death inside there--death! Beware, Lazarus!</p>

<p>CHORUS OF THE GUARD--(<i>as the laughter of Lazarus is heard
again from the dark palace</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ALL THE GUARDS--</p>

<blockquote>

 Death is dead!</p>

<h2><a name="s302">SCENE TWO</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The banquet hall in the palace of Tiberius--an
immense high-ceilinged room. In the rear, center, is a great
arched doorway. Smaller arches in the middle of the side walls
lead into other rooms. Long couches are placed along the walls at
right and left, and along the rear wall on either side of the
arch. Before these couches, a series of narrow tables is set. In
the center of the room on a high dais is the ivory and gold chair
of C&aelig;sar, a table in front of it, couches for him to
recline on at either side. On this table, and on all the tables
for his guests, gold lamps with shades of crimson-purple are
placed.</i></p>

<p><i>Reclining on the couches on the right are young women and
girls, on the left, youths of an equal number.</i></p>

<p>(<i>The masks are based on the Roman masks of the periods of
Boyhood [or Girlhood], Youth, and Young Manhood [or Womanhood]
and there are seven individuals of each period and sex in each of
the three types of the Introspective, Self-Tortured; the Servile,
Hypocritical; and the Cruel, Revengeful--a crowd of forty-two in
all. There is a distinctive character to the masks of each sex,
the stamp of an effeminate corruption on all the male, while
the</i> <i>female have a bold, masculine expression. The male
masks are a blotched heliotrope in shade. These youths wear
female wigs of curled wire like frizzed hair of a yellow gold.
They are dressed in women's robes of pale heliotrope, they wear
anklets and bracelets and necklaces. The women are dressed as
males in crimson or deep purple. They also wear wire wigs but of
straight hair cut in short boyish mode, dyed either deep purple
or crimson. Those with crimson hair are dressed in purple, and
vice versa. The female voices are harsh, strident, mannish--those
of the youths affected, lisping, effeminate. The whole effect of
these two groups is of sex corrupted and warped, of invented
lusts and artificial vices.</i></p>

<p>(<i>The Chorus in this scene and the next is composed of three
males and four females--the males in the period of Youth, one in
each of the types represented, and three of the females in
similar type-period masks. The fourth female is masked in the
period of Womanhood in the Proud, Self-Reliant type. They sit,
facing front in their double-sized masks, on the side steps of
the dais, four on right, three on left.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Pompeia, a Roman noblewoman, the favorite mistress of
C&aelig;sar, sits at front, right.</i></p>

<p><i>She wears a half-mask on the upper part of her face,
olive-colored with the red of blood smoldering through, with
great, dark, cruel eyes--a dissipated mask of intense evil
beauty, of lust and perverted passion. Beneath the mask, her own
complexion is pale, her gentle, girlish mouth is set in an
expression of agonized self-loathing and weariness of spirit. Her
body is strong and beautiful. Her wig and dress are
purple.</i></p>

<p><i>Tiberius C&aelig;sar stands on the dais, dressed in deep
purple, fringed and ornamented with crimson and gold. An old man
of seventy-six, tall, broad and corpulent but of great muscular
strength still despite his age, his shiny white cranium rises
like a polished shell above his half-masked face. This mask is a
pallid purple blotched with darker color, as if the imperial
blood in his veins had been sickened by age and debauchery. The
eyes are protuberant, leering, cynical slits, the long nose, once
finely modeled, now gross and thickened, the forehead lowering
and grim. Beneath the mask, his own mouth looks as incongruous as
Caligula's. The lips are thin and stern and self-contained--the
lips of an able soldier-statesman of rigid probity. His chin is
forceful and severe. The complexion of his own skin is that of a
healthy old campaigner.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, slaves are hurriedly putting out the
many lamps. From outside, the laughter of Lazarus rises on the
deep ground swell of the Guard's laughter. The walls and massive
columns seem to reverberate with the sound. In the banquet room
all are listening fascinatedly. Every reaction, from the extreme
of panic fear or hypnotized ecstasy to a feigned cynical
amusement or a pretended supercilious indifference, is
represented in their frozen attitudes. Tiberius stands, shrinking
back, staring at the doorway in the rear with superstitious
dread. A squad of the Guard surround the dais, commanded by
Flavius.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>in a strained voice shaken by apprehension and
awe</i>) Marcellus! Strike him down! Stab him!</p>

<p>SOLDIERS OF THE GUARD--(<i>from without</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 Death is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>as he suddenly sees the shining figure of
Lazarus appear at the end of the dark hall beyond the
archway</i>) Gods! Flavius, look! (<i>He points with a shaking
finger. Flavius has leaped up to his side.</i>)</p>

<p>FLAVIUS--(<i>not without dread himself</i>) That is the man,
C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--Man? Say a d&aelig;mon! (<i>to the slaves who are
turning out the few remaining lamps</i>) Quick! Darkness! (<i>He
puts out the lamp on his table himself. Then as nothing is seen
but the light from the approaching Lazarus</i>) Flavius! Stand
here in my place! It will think you are C&aelig;sar! (<i>He
clumps heavily down the steps of the dais.</i>) Guards! Here!
Cover me with your shields! (<i>He goes to the extreme right
corner, front, and crouches there. His Guards follow him. They
hold their shields so that they form a wall around him and half
over him. Then Caligula's voice is heard screaming above the
chorus of laughter as he enters the hall behind Lazarus.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--Beware of death! I will defend you, Lazarus! (<i>He
is seen to rush past Lazarus, flourishing his sword and comes
running into the room, shouting</i>) C&aelig;sar! Dare not to
murder Lazarus! (<i>He leaps to the dais and up its steps in a
frenzy.</i>) Dare not, I say! (<i>He stabs Flavius with a savage
cry</i>) Ah! (<i>Then, as the body of Flavius falls heavily and
rolls down the steps at right, he begins to laugh, at first a
clear laughter of selfless joy, sounding</i> <i>startlingly
incongruous from him.</i>) I have saved you, Lazarus--at the risk
of my own life--and now, hear me, I can laugh! (<i>Lazarus
appears in the archway, Miriam behind him. He stops laughing and
immediately there is silence, except for Caligula. Lazarus casts
a luminous glow over the whole room in which the masked faces
appear distorted and livid. Caligula stands with upraised sword
by the chair of C&aelig;sar. Suddenly his laughter cracks,
changes, becomes full of his old fear and bloodlust.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--Ha-ha-ha! See, Lazarus! (<i>He points to the body of
Flavius with his sword.</i>) Welcome in the name of C&aelig;sar,
now C&aelig;sar is slain and I am C&aelig;sar! (<i>He assumes the
absurd grandiose posture of his imperial posing. No one looks at
him or hears him. Their eyes are on Lazarus as he moves directly
to where Tiberius crouches behind the shields of the Guards.
Miriam follows him. Caligula turns and stares toward him, and
then down at the body of Flavius and back, in a petrified,
bewildered stupor. Lazarus steps up beside Tiberius. The Guards
make way for him fearfully.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>feeling his nearness--straightening himself with
a certain dignity</i>) Strike! I have been a soldier. Thou canst
not make me fear death, D&aelig;mon! (<i>He draws his toga over
his face.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiling gently</i>) Then fear not fear, Tiberius!
(<i>He reaches out and pulls back the toga from his face.
Tiberius looks into his eyes, at first shrinkingly, then with
growing reassurance, his own masked face clearly revealed now in
the light from Lazarus.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>at first falteringly</i>) So--thou art not evil?
Thou art not come to contrive my murder? (<i>As Lazarus smilingly
shakes his head, Tiberius frowns.</i>) Then why dost thou laugh
against C&aelig;sar? (<i>then bitterly--with a twisted attempt at
a smile</i>) Yet I like thy laughter. It is young. Once I laughed
somewhat like that--so I pardon thee. I will even laugh at thee
in return. Ha-ha! (<i>His laughter is cold, cruel and merciless
as the grin of a skeleton.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>who has been staring in a bewildered stupor from
Tiberius, whom he thought he had killed, to the body of
Flavius--quaking with terror now as if this laugh was meant for
him, drops to his knees, his sword clattering down the steps to
the floor</i>) Mercy, Tiberius! I implore you forgive your
Caligula!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>not understanding. Fixing his eyes on Caligula
with a malevolent irony.</i>) Come down from my throne, Caligula.
(<i>Caligula slinks down warily.</i>) You are too impatient. But
I must pardon you, too--for where could I find another heir so
perfect for serving my spite upon mankind? (<i>He has walked
toward the throne while he is speaking, Caligula backing away
from him. Lazarus remains where he is, Miriam beside and to the
rear of him. Tiberius, his eyes fixed on Caligula, stumbles
against the body of Flavius. He gives a startled gasp and shrinks
back, calling</i>) Lights! A light here! (<i>A crowd of masked
slaves obey his orders. One runs to him with a lantern. He looks
down at Flavius' corpse--half to himself</i>) I did wisely to
stand him in my place. (<i>to Caligula--with sinister
emphasis</i>) Too impatient, my loving grandchild! Take care lest
I become impatient also--with your impatience! (<i>Caligula
shudders and backs away to the extreme left corner, front, where
he crouches on his haunches as inconspicuously as possible.
Tiberius suddenly whirls around as if he felt a dagger at his
back.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--Where--? (<i>seeing Lazarus where he had been--with
relief--staring at his face now that the room is flooded with the
purplish-crimson glow from all the lamps</i>) Ah, you are there.
More lights! Darkness leads men into error. My heir mistakes a
man for C&aelig;sar and C&aelig;sar, it appears, has mistaken a
man for a d&aelig;mon! (<i>scrutinizing him--with sinister
finality</i>) I can deal with men. I know them well. Too well!
(<i>He laughs grimly.</i>) Therefore I hate them. (<i>He mounts
the steps of the dais and sits on the couch at left of
table--staring at Lazarus, wonderingly</i>) But you
seem--something other than man! That light! (<i>Then he forces a
harsh laugh.</i>) A trick! I had forgotten you are a magician.
(<i>arrogantly</i>) Stand there, Jew. I would question you about
your magic. (<i>Smilingly Lazarus ascends to where Tiberius
points at the top of the dais. Miriam remains standing at the
foot. Tiberius stares for a while with somber intensity at
Lazarus.</i>) They say you died and have returned from death?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiling--as if he were correcting a child</i>)
There is no death, C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>with a sneer of scepticism but with an
underlying</i> <i>eagerness</i>) I have heard you teach that
folly. (<i>then threateningly</i>) You shall be given full
opportunity to prove it! (<i>a</i> <i>pause--then in a low voice,
bending down toward Lazarus</i>) Do you foretell the future?
(<i>trembling but with a pretense of carelessness</i>) Must I die
soon?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>simply</i>) Yes, C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>jumping up with a shuddering start</i>) Soon?
Soon? (<i>then his fear turning to rage</i>) What do you say?
Vile Jew, do you dare threaten me with death! (<i>Lazarus,
looking into his eyes, begins to laugh softly. Tiberius sinks
back on his couch, fighting to control himself--confusedly</i>)
Laugh not, I ask you. I am old. It is not seemly. (<i>Lazarus
ceases his low laughter. A pause. Tiberius broods--then
suddenly</i>) And you were really dead? (<i>He shudders.</i>)
Come nearer. I need to watch your face. I have learned to read
the lies in faces. A C&aelig;sar gets much practice--from
childhood on--too much! (<i>with awe</i>) Your eyes are dark with
death. While I watch them, answer me, what cured thee of
death?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gently</i>) There is only life, C&aelig;sar.
(<i>then gaily mocking but compellingly</i>) And laughter! Look!
Look well into my eyes, old Reader of Lies, and see if you can
find aught in them that is not life--and laughter! (<i>He laughs
softly. A ripple of soft laughter from the motionless figures
about the room echoes his. Tiberius stares into his eyes. In the
silence that ensues Pompeia gets up and walks over to the dais.
She stops to stare for a moment with cruel contempt at Miriam,
then stands and looks up at Lazarus, trying in vain to attract
his or C&aelig;sar's attention. Failing in this, she passes over
and sits beside Caligula, whose attention is concentrated on
Lazarus.</i>)</p>

<p>POMPEIA--I admire your strange magician, Caligula.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>without looking at her</i>) He is no magician.
He is something like a god.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>longingly</i>) His laughter is like a god's. He
is strong. I love him.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>turning to her--coarsely</i>) Do not waste your
lust. He is faithful to his wife, I warn you.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>She points to Miriam.</i>) Not that ugly
slave?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--Yes. And yet, on our journey, whole herds of
women--and many as beautiful as you, Pompeia--threw themselves on
him and begged for his love.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>her voice hardening</i>) And he?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--He laughed--and passed on. (<i>She starts. Caligula
goes on wonderingly.</i>) But they seemed as happy as if his
laughter had possessed them! You are a woman. Tell me, how could
that be?</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>her voice cruel</i>) He shall not laugh at
me!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>tauntingly</i>) I will bet a string of pearls
against your body for a night that he does.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>defiantly</i>) Done! (<i>Then she laughs--a low,
cruel laugh--staring at Miriam</i>) So he loves that woman?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>curiously</i>) What are you planning?</p>

<p>POMPEIA--I shall offer her the fruit C&aelig;sar preserves for
those he fears.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with a careless shrug</i>) You will not win his
love by killing her.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--I no longer want his love. I want to see him suffer,
to hear his laughter choke in his throat with pain! (<i>She
speaks with more and more voluptuous satisfaction.</i>) Then
<i>I</i> shall laugh! (<i>She laughs softly and steps
forward.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>concernedly</i>) Stop. I am his protector.
(<i>then suddenly</i>) But what is the Jewess to me? (<i>with
more and more of a spirit of perverse cruelty</i>) Do it,
Pompeia! His laughter is too cruel to us! We must save death from
him!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>walks to the dais which she ascends slowly until
she stands by C&aelig;sar's couch behind him, confronting
Lazarus. But the two men remain unmindful of her presence.
Tiberius continues to stare into Lazarus' eyes. His whole body is
now relaxed, at rest, a dreamy smile softens his thin, compressed
mouth. Pompeia leans over and takes a peach from the bowl of
fruit on C&aelig;sar's table and, taking Tiberius' hand in her
other, she kisses it and calls insistently</i>) C&aelig;sar. It
is I, Pompeia. (<i>Lazarus does not look at her. She stares at
him defiantly. Tiberius blinks his eyes in a daze.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>dreamily</i>) Yes! A cloud came from a depth of
sky--around me, softly, warmly, and the cloud dissolved into the
sky, and the sky into peace! (<i>suddenly springing to his feet
and staring about him in a confused rage--clutching Pompeia by
the shoulder and forcing her to her knees</i>) What are you doing
here?</p>

<p>POMPEIA--Forgive your loving slave! I grew afraid this
magician had put you under a spell. (<i>She stares at Lazarus,
her words challenging him.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>confusedly, sinking back on his couch and
releasing her</i>) A spell? Could it be he laid a dream of death
upon me, leading me to death? (<i>He trembles
timorously--appealing to Lazarus</i>) Whatever magic thou didst
to me, D&aelig;mon, I beseech thee undo it!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiling</i>) Do you fear peace?</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>harshly and insolently</i>) Mock not at
C&aelig;sar, dog! (<i>Lazarus continues to smile. His eyes remain
on C&aelig;sar. He seems absolutely unaware of Pompeia. This
enrages her the more against him. She speaks tauntingly to
Tiberius.</i>) Surely, C&aelig;sar, this magician must have
powerful charms since he dares to mock Tiberius to his face!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>stung</i>) Be still! (<i>then in a low tone to
her</i>) Do you not know this Lazarus died and then by his magic
rose from his tomb.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>scornfully</i>) To believe that, I must have seen
it, C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>impatiently</i>) Do you think I would believe
without good evidence? I have had them take the statements of
many witnesses. The miracle was done in conjunction with another
Jew acting as this man's tool. This other Jew, the report states,
could not possibly have possessed any magic power Himself, for
Pilate crucified Him a short time after and He died in pain and
weakness within a few hours. But this Lazarus laughs at
death!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>looks up, smiling with ironical bitterness</i>)
Couldst Thou but hear, Jesus! And men shall keep on in panic
nailing Man's soul to the cross of their fear until in the end
they do it to avenge Thee, for Thine Honor and Glory! (<i>He
sighs sadly--then after a struggle overcoming himself--with
exultance</i>) Yes! (<i>His eyes fall again to Tiberius and he
smiles.</i>) Yes! Yes to the stupid as to the wise! To what is
understood and to what cannot be understood! Known and unknown!
Over and over! Forever and ever! Yes! (<i>He laughs softly to
himself.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>with superstitious dread</i>) What dost thou
mean, D&aelig;mon?</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>with indignant scorn</i>) Let him prove there is
no death, C&aelig;sar! (<i>She appeals to the company who
straighten up on their couches with interest.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chant demandingly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let him prove there is no death!<br>
 We are bored!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>echoing</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prove there is no death!<br>
 We are bored, C&aelig;sar!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>waits to see what Lazarus will say--then as he
says nothing, plucking up his courage--his cruelty aroused</i>)
Do you hear, Lazarus?</p>

<p>POMPEIA--Make him perform his miracle again!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>as before</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let him perform a miracle!<br>
 We are bored, C&aelig;sar!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>They now stand up and coming from behind their
tables, move forward toward the dais.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A miracle!<br>
 We are bored!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>POMPEIA--Let him raise someone from the dead!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting with a pettish insistence</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Raise the dead!<br>
 We are bored!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>echoing--grouping in a big semicircle as of
spectators in a theatre, around and to the sides of the dais, one
sex on each side. Caligula moves in from the left in front of
them. They form in three ranks, the first squatting on their hams
like savages [as Caligula does], the second rank crouching over
them, the third leaning over the second, all with a hectic,
morbid interest.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are bored!<br>
 Raise the dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>with a cruel smile</i>) I have thought of a
special test for him, C&aelig;sar. (<i>She whispers in
C&aelig;sar's ear and points to Miriam and the fruit in her
hand.</i>) And he must laugh!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>with a harsh, cruel chuckle</i>) Yes, I shall
command him to laugh! (<i>then disgustedly</i>) But she is sad
and old. I will be only doing him a favor.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>rocking back and forth on his haunches--looking
at Lazarus with taunting cruelty</i>) No, C&aelig;sar! I know he
loves her!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--Yes! (<i>He steps down from the dais to Miriam's side
and taking her head in both his hands, he kisses her on the
lips.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>with a malignant grin</i>) Give her the
fruit!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>advances and offers the peach to Miriam--with a
hard, cruel little laugh</i>) C&aelig;sar invites you to eat!</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>to Lazarus--requesting meekly but longingly</i>)
May I accept, Lazarus? Is it time at last? My love has followed
you over long roads among strangers and each league we came from
home my heart has grown older. Now it is too old for you, a heart
too weary for your loving laughter. Ever your laughter has grown
younger, Lazarus! Upward it springs like a lark from a field, and
sings! Once I knew your laughter was my child, my son of Lazarus;
but then it grew younger and I felt at last it had returned to my
womb--and ever younger and younger--until, tonight, when I spoke
to you of home, I felt new birth-pains as your laughter, grown
too young for me, flew back to the unborn--a birth so like a
death! (<i>She sobs and wipes her eyes with her sleeve--then
humbly, reaching out for the fruit</i>) May I accept it, Lazarus?
You should have newborn laughing hearts to love you. My old one
labors with memories and its blood is sluggish with the past.
Your home on the hills of space is too far away. My heart longs
for the warmth of close walls of earth baked in the sun. Our home
in Bethany, Lazarus, where you and my children lived and died.
Our tomb near our home, Lazarus, in which you and my children
wait for me. Is it time at last?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>deeply moved</i>) Poor lonely heart! It has been
crueler for you than I remembered. Go in peace--to peace! (<i>His
voice trembles in spite of himself.</i>) I shall be lonely, dear
one. (<i>with a note of pleading</i>) You have never laughed with
my laughter. Will you call back--Yes!--when you know--to tell me
you understand and laugh with me at last?</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>not answering him, to Pompeia, taking the peach
and making a humble courtesy before her</i>) I thank you, pretty
lady. (<i>She raises the peach toward her mouth. Involuntarily
one of Lazarus' hands half-reaches out as if to stop
her.</i>)</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>with savage triumph, pointing</i>) See! He would
stop her! He is afraid of death!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>pointing--jeeringly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is afraid of death!<br>
 Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>jeeringly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>bites into the peach and, chewing, begins, as if
immediately affected, to talk like a garrulous old woman, her
words coming quicker and quicker as her voice becomes fainter and
fainter</i>) Say what you like, it is much better I should go
home first, Lazarus. We have been away so long, there will be so
much to attend to about the house. And all the children will be
waiting. You would be as helpless as a child, Lazarus. Between
you and the children, things would soon be in a fine state!
(<i>more and more confused</i>) No, no! You cannot help me,
dearest one. You are only in my way. No, I will make the fire.
When you laid it the last time, we all had to run for our lives,
choking, the smoke poured from the windows, the neighbors thought
the house was burning! (<i>She laughs--a queer, vague little
inward laugh.</i>) You are so impractical. The neighbors all get
the best of you. Money slips through your fingers. If it was not
for me--(<i>She sighs--then brightly and lovingly</i>) But,
dearest husband, why do you take it so to heart? Why do you feel
guilty because you are not like other men? That is why I love you
so much. Is it a sin to be born a dreamer? But God, He must be a
dreamer, too, or how would we be on earth? Do not keep saying to
yourself so bitterly, you are a failure in life! Do not sit
brooding on the hilltop in the evening like a black figure of Job
against the sky! (<i>her voice trembling</i>) Even if God has
taken our little ones--yes, in spite of sorrow--have you not a
good home I make for you, and a wife who loves you? (<i>She
forces a chuckle.</i>) Be grateful, then--for me! Smile, my sad
one! Laugh a little once in a while! Come home, bringing me
laughter of the wind from the hills! (<i>swaying, looking at the
peach in her hand</i>) What a mellow, sweet fruit! Did you bring
it home for me? (<i>She falls back into his arms. Gently he lets
her body sink until it rests against the steps of the dais.
Tiberius rises from his couch to bend over with cruel gloating.
Pompeia steps nearer to Lazarus, staring at him mockingly.
Caligula hops to her side, looking from Lazarus to Miriam. The
half-circle of masked figures moves closer, straining forward and
downward as if to overwhelm the two figures at the foot of the
dais with their concentrated death wish.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>thickly</i>) She is dead, and I do not hear you
laugh!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>bending down--supplicatingly</i>) Miriam! Call
back to me! Laugh! (<i>He pauses. A second of dead silence. Then,
with a sound that is very like a sob, he kisses her on the
lips.</i>) I am lonely!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>with savage malice--jeeringly</i>) See! He weeps,
C&aelig;sar! (<i>She bursts into strident laughter.</i>)
Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>echoing her laughter</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha!<br>
 There is fear!<br>
 There is death!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is death!<br>
 Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>in a frenzy of despairing rage, hopping up and
down</i>) Liar! Charlatan! Weakling! How you have cheated
Caligula! (<i>He suddenly slaps Lazarus viciously across the
face.</i>) There is death! Laugh, if you dare!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>standing--in a sinister cold rage, the crueler
because his dream of a cure for death is baffled, yet feeling his
power as C&aelig;sar triumphant nevertheless</i>) And I thought
you might be a daemon. I thought you might have a magic
cure--(<i>with revengeful fury</i>) But death is, and death is
mine! I shall make you pray for death! And I shall make Death
laugh at you! Ha-ha-ha-ha! (<i>in a frenzy as Lazarus neither
makes a sound nor looks up</i>) Laugh, Lazarus! Laugh at
yourself! Laugh with me! (<i>then to his Soldiers</i>) Scourge
him! Make him laugh!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>running to Soldiers--fiercely</i>) Give me a
scourge!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>running to the Soldiers--hysterically</i>)
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Let me beat him, C&aelig;sar! (<i>They group behind
him. The rods and scourges are uplifted over his back to strike,
when in the dead expectant silence, Miriam's body is seen to rise
in a writhing tortured last effort.</i>)</p>

<p>MIRIAM--(<i>in a voice of unearthly sweetness</i>) Yes! There
is only life! Lazarus, be not lonely! (<i>She laughs and sinks
back and is still.</i></p>

<p>(<i>A shuddering murmur of superstitious fear comes from them
as</i> <i>they shrink back swiftly from Lazarus, remaining
huddled one against the other. Pompeia runs to the feet of
Tiberius and crouches down on the steps below him, as if for
protection, her terrified eyes on Miriam. Caligula runs to her
and crouches beside and beneath her.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>kisses Miriam again and raises his head. His face
is radiant with new faith and joy. He smiles with happiness and
speaks to himself with a mocking affection as if to an amusing
child.</i>) That much remained hidden in me of the sad old
Lazarus who died of self-pity--his loneliness! Lonely no more!
Man's loneliness is but his fear of life! Lonely no more!
Millions of laughing stars there are around me! And laughing
dust, born once of woman on this earth, now freed to dance! New
stars are born of dust eternally! The old, grown mellow with God,
burst into flaming seed! The fields of infinite space are
sown--and grass for sheep springs up on the hills of earth! But
there is no death, nor fear, nor loneliness! There is only God's
Eternal Laughter! His Laughter flows into the lonely heart!
(<i>He begins to laugh, his laughter clear and ringing--the
laughter of a conqueror arrogant with happiness and the pride of
a new triumph. He bends and picks up the body of Miriam in his
arms and, his head thrown back, laughing, he ascends the dais and
places her on the table as on a bier. He touches one hand on her
breast, as if he were taking an oath to life on her heart, looks
upward and laughs, his voice ringing more and more with a
terrible unbearable power and beauty that beats those in the room
into an abject submissive panic.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Tiberius grovels half under the table, his hands covering
his ears, his face on the floor; he is laughing with the agony
and terror of death. Pompeia lies face down on the first step and
beats it with her fists; she is laughing with horror and
self-loathing. Caligula, his hands clutching his head, pounds it
against the edge of the steps; he is laughing with grief and
remorse. The rest, soldiers, slaves and the prostitutes of both
sexes, writhe and twist distractedly, seeking to hide their heads
against each other, beating each other and the floor with
clenched hands. An agonized moan of supplicating laughter comes
from them all.</i>)</p>

<p>ALL--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!<br>
 Let us die, Lazarus!<br>
 Mercy, Laughing One!<br>
 Mercy of death!<br>
 Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>But the laughter of Lazarus is as remote now as the
laughter of a god.</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a04">ACT FOUR</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>SCENE ONE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The same as previous Scene--the same night a short
while later. All the lamps are out except the one on the table on
the dais which, placed beside the head of Miriam, shines down
upon the white mask of her face. In the half-darkness, the walls
are lost in shadow, the room seems immense, the dais
nearer.</i></p>

<p><i>Lazarus sits on the couch at the right on the dais. His
face is strong and proud although his eyes are fixed down on the
face of Miriam. He seems more youthful still now, like a young
son who keeps watch by the body of his mother, but at the same
time retaining the aloof serenity of the statue of a god. His
face expresses sorrow and a happiness that transcends
sorrow.</i></p>

<p><i>On the other side of the table, at the end of the couch,
Tiberius sits facing front, his elbows on his knees, his large
hands with bloated veins hanging loosely. He keeps his gaze
averted from the corpse. He talks to Lazarus half over his
shoulder.</i></p>

<p><i>On the top step, Pompeia sits, facing right, her hands
clasped about one knee, the other leg stretched down to the lower
step. Her head is thrown back and she is gazing up into Lazarus'
face.</i></p>

<p><i>On the step below her, Caligula squats on his haunches, his
arms on his knees, his fists pressed to his temples. He is
staring straight before him.</i></p>

<p><i>Only these four people are in the room now.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>gloomily</i>) Was she dead, D&aelig;mon, and was
it thy power that recalled life to her body for that moment? Or
was she still living and her words only the last desire of her
love to comfort you, Lazarus? (<i>Lazarus does not reply.</i>) If
thou dost not tell me, I must always doubt thee, D&aelig;mon.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>with a sigh of bewildered happiness, turns to
Caligula</i>) I am glad he laughed, Caligula! Did I say I loved
him before? Then it was only my body that wanted a slave. Now it
is my heart that desires a master! Now I know love for the first
time in my life!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>bitterly</i>) Fool! What does he care for love?
(<i>somberly</i>) He loves everyone--but no one--not even me!
(<i>He broods frowningly.</i>)</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>following her own thoughts</i>) And now that hag
is dead he will need a woman, young and beautiful, to protect and
comfort him, to make him a home and bear his children! (<i>She
dreams, her eyes again fixed on Lazarus--then suddenly turning to
Caligula</i>) I am glad I lost our bet. But you must accept some
other payment. Now I know love, I may not give myself to any man
save him!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--I do not want you! What are you but another animal!
Faugh! (<i>with a grimace of disgust</i>) Pleasure is dirty and
joyless! Or we who seek it are, which comes to the same thing.
(<i>then grimly</i>) But our bet can rest. This is not the end.
There may still be a chance for you to laugh at him!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--No! Now I could not! I should weep for his
defeat!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>gloomily arguing, half to himself</i>) His
laughter triumphed over me, but he has not brought her back to
life. I think he knows no cure for another's death, as I had
hoped. And I must always doubt that it was not some
trick--(<i>harshly</i>) until I have tested him with his own
life! He cannot cheat me then! (<i>a pause--arguing to
himself</i>) But he was dead--that much has been proved--and
before he died he was old and sad. What did he find beyond there?
(<i>suddenly--turning to Lazarus now</i>) What did you find
beyond death, Lazarus?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>exaltedly</i>) Life! God's Eternal Laughter!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>shaking his head</i>) I want hope--for me,
Tiberius C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--What is--you? But there is hope for Man! Love is
Man's hope--love for his life on earth, a noble love above
suspicion and distrust! Hitherto Man has always suspected his
life, and in revenge and self-torture his love has been
faithless! He has even betrayed Eternity, his mother, with his
slave he calls Immortal Soul! (<i>He laughs softly, gaily,
mockingly--then to Tiberius directly</i>) Hope for you, Tiberius
C&aelig;sar? Then dare to love Eternity without your fear
desiring to possess her! Be brave enough to be possessed!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>strangely</i>) My mother was the wife of
C&aelig;sar. (<i>then dully</i>) I do not understand.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--Men are too cowardly to understand! And so the worms
of their little fears eat them and grow fat and terrible and
become their jealous gods they must appease with lies!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>wearily</i>) Your words are meaningless,
Lazarus. You are a fool. All laughter is malice, all gods are
dead, and life is a sickness.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>laughs pityingly</i>) So say the race of men,
whose lives are long dyings! They evade their fear of death by
becoming so sick of life that by the time death comes they are
too lifeless to fear it! Their disease triumphs over death--a
noble victory called resignation! "We are sick," they say,
"therefore there is no God in us, therefore there is no God!" Oh,
if men would but interpret that first cry of man fresh from the
womb as the laughter of one who even then says to his heart, "It
is my pride as God to become Man. Then let it be my pride as Man
to recreate the God in me!" (<i>He laughs softly but with
exultant pride.</i>)</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>laughing with him--proudly</i>) He will create a
god in me! I shall be proud!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>pounding his temples with his
fists--tortured</i>) I am Caligula. I was born in a camp among
soldiers. My father was Germanicus, a hero, as all men know. But
I do not understand this--and though I burst with pride, I cannot
laugh with joy!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>gloomily</i>) Obscurities! I have found nothing
in life that merits pride. I am not proud of being
C&aelig;sar--and what is a god but a C&aelig;sar over
C&aelig;sars? If fools kneel and worship me because they fear me,
should I be proud? But C&aelig;sar is a fact, and Tiberius, a
man, is one, and I cling to these certainties--and I do not wish
to die! If I were sure of eternal sleep beyond there, deep rest
and forgetfulness of all I have ever seen or heard or hated or
loved on earth, I would gladly die! But surely, Lazarus, nothing
is sure--peace the least sure of all--and I fear there is no rest
beyond there, that one remembers there as here and cannot sleep,
that the mind goes on eternally the same--a long insomnia of
memories and regrets and the ghosts of dreams one has poisoned to
death passing with white bodies spotted by the leprous fingers of
one's lusts. (<i>bitterly</i>) I fear the long nights now in
which I lie awake and listen to Death dancing round me in the
darkness, prancing to the drum beat of my heart! (<i>He
shudders.</i>) And I am afraid, Lazarus--afraid that there is no
sleep beyond there, either!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--There is peace! (<i>His words are like a benediction
he pronounces upon them. Soothed in a mysterious, childlike way,
they repeat the word after him, wonderingly.</i>)</p>

<p>POMPEIA--Peace?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--Peace?</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--Peace? (<i>For a long moment there is complete
silence. Then Tiberius sighs heavily, shaking his head.</i>)
Peace! Another word blurred into a senseless sigh by men's
longing! A bubble of froth blown from the lips of the dying
toward the stars! No! (<i>He grins bitterly--then looks at
Lazarus--somberly contemptuous and threatening</i>) You are
pleased to act the mysterious, Jew, but I shall solve you!
(<i>then with a lawyer-like incisiveness</i>) There is one
certainty about you and I must know the cause--for there must be
a cause and a rational explanation! You were fifty when you
died--</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiling mockingly</i>) Yes. When I died.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>unheeding</i>) And now your appearance is of one
younger by a score. Not alone your appearance! You <i>are</i>
young. I see the fact, the effect. And I demand an explanation of
the cause without mystic nonsense or evasion.
(<i>threateningly</i>) And I warn you to answer directly in plain
words--and not to laugh, you understand!--not to dare!--or I
shall lose patience with you and--(<i>with a grim smile</i>) I
can be terrible! (<i>Lazarus smiles gently at him. He turns away
with confused annoyance, then back to Lazarus, resuming his
lawyer-like manner.</i>) What was it restored your youth? How did
you contrive that your body reversed the natural process and
grows younger? Is it a charm by which you invoke a supernatural
force? Or is it a powder you dissolve in wine? Or a liquid? Or an
unguent you rub into the skin to revitalize the old bones and
tissues? Or--what is it, Lazarus?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gently</i>) I know that age and time are but
timidities of thought.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>broodingly--as if he had not
heard--persuasively</i>) Perhaps you ask yourself, what would
Tiberius do with youth? Then, because you must have heard rumors
of my depravity, you will conclude the old lecher desires youth
for his lusts! (<i>He laughs harshly.</i>) Ha! Why, do not my
faithful subjects draw pictures of an old buck goat upon the
walls and write above them, C&aelig;sar? And they are just. In
self-contempt of Man I have made this man, myself, the most
swinish and contemptible of men! Yes! In all this empire there is
no man so base a hog as I! (<i>He grins bitterly and
ironically.</i>) My claim to this excellence, at least, is not
contested! Everyone admits therein Tiberius is by right their
C&aelig;sar! (<i>He laughs bitterly.</i>) Ha! So who would
believe Tiberius if he said, I want youth again because I loathe
lust and long for purity!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gently</i>) I believe you, C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>stares at him--deeply moved</i>) You--believe--?
(<i>then gruffly</i>) You lie! You are not mad--and only a madman
would believe another man! (<i>then confidingly, leaning over
toward Lazarus</i>) I know it is folly to speak--but--one gets
old, one becomes talkative, one wishes to confess, to say the
thing one has always kept hidden, to reveal one's unique
truth--and there is so little time left--and one is alone!
Therefore the old--like children--talk to themselves, for they
have reached that hopeless wisdom of experience which knows that
though one were to cry it in the streets to multitudes, or
whisper it in the kiss to one's beloved, the only ears that can
ever hear one's secret are one's own! (<i>He laughs
bitterly.</i>) And so I talk aloud, Lazarus! I talk to my
loneliness!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>simply</i>) I hear, Tiberius.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>again moved and confused--forcing a mocking
smile</i>) Liar! Eavesdropper! You merely--listen! (<i>Then he
turns away.</i>) My mother, Livia, that strong woman, giving
birth to me, desired not a child, but a C&aelig;sar--just as,
married to Augustus, she loved him not but loved herself as
C&aelig;sar's wife. She made me feel, in the proud questioning of
her scornful eyes, that to win her mother love I must become
C&aelig;sar. She poisoned Prince Marcellus and young Gaius and
Lucius that the way might be clear for me. I used to see their
blood dance in red specks before my eyes when I looked at the
sky. Now--(<i>he brushes his hand before his eyes</i>) it is all
a red blot! I cannot distinguish. There have been too many. My
mother--her blood is in that blot, for I revenged myself on her.
I did not kill her, it is true, but I deprived her of her power
and she died, as I knew she must, that powerful woman who bore me
as a weapon! The murder was subtle and cruel--how cruel only that
passionate, deep-breasted woman unslaked by eighty years of
devoured desires could know! Too cruel! I did not go to her
funeral. I was afraid her closed eyes might open and look at me!
(<i>then with almost a cry</i>) I want youth, Lazarus, that I may
play again about her feet with the love I felt for her before I
learned to read her eyes! (<i>He half sobs, bowing his head. A
pause.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>nudging Pompeia--with a crafty whisper</i>) Do
you hear? The old lecher talks to himself. He is becoming senile.
He will soon die. And I shall be C&aelig;sar. Then I shall
laugh!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>staring up at Lazarus' face, hearing only
Caligula's words without their meaning</i>) No. My Lazarus does
not laugh now. See. His mouth is silent--and a little sad, I
think.</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gently and comfortingly</i>) I hear,
Tiberius.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>harshly</i>) I hated that woman, my mother, and
I still hate her! Have you ever loved, Lazarus? (<i>then with a
glance at Miriam's body and a shuddering away from
it--vaguely</i>) I was forgetting her. I killed your love, too,
did I not? Well, I must! I envy those who are loved. Where I can,
I kill love--for retribution's sake--but much of it escapes me.
(<i>then harshly again</i>) I loved Agrippina. We were married. A
son was born to us. We were happy. Then that proud woman, my
mother, saw my happiness. Was she jealous of my love? Or did she
know no happy man would wish to be C&aelig;sar? Well, she
condemned my happiness to death. She whispered to Augustus and he
ordered me to divorce Agrippina. I should have opened her veins
and mine, and died with her. But my mother stayed by me,
Agrippina was kept away, my mother spoke to me and spoke to me
and even wept, that tall woman, strong as a great man, and I
consented that my love be murdered. Then my mother married me to
a whore. Why? The whore was C&aelig;sar's daughter, true--but I
feel that was not all of it, that my mother wished to keep me
tortured that I might love her alone and long to be C&aelig;sar!
(<i>He laughs harshly.</i>) Ha! In brief, I married the whore,
she tortured me, my mother's scheming prospered--that subtle and
crafty woman!--and many years passed in being here and there, in
doing this and that, in growing full of hate and revengeful
ambition to be C&aelig;sar. At last, Augustus died. I was
C&aelig;sar. Then I killed that whore, my wife, and I starved my
mother's strength to death until she died, and I began to take
pleasure in vengeance upon men, and pleasure in taking vengeance
on myself. (<i>He grins horribly.</i>) It is all very simple, as
you see! (<i>He suddenly starts to his feet--with harsh arrogance
and pride, threateningly</i>) Enough! Why do I tell you these old
tales? Must I explain to you why I want youth? It is my whim! I
am C&aelig;sar! And now I must lie down and try to sleep! And it
is my command that you reveal the secret of your youth to me when
I awake, or else--(<i>with malignant cruelty</i>) I will have to
revenge the death of a hope on you--and a hope at my age demands
a terrible expiation on its slayer! (<i>He walks down and starts
to go off, right--then turns and addresses Lazarus with grim
irony.</i>) Good night to you, Lazarus. And remember there shall
be death while I am C&aelig;sar! (<i>He turns to</i>
<i>go.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiling affectionately at him, shakes his
head</i>) C&aelig;sar must believe in death. But does the husband
of Agrippina?</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>stops short and stares at Lazarus, confused and
stuttering</i>) What--what--do you mean, Lazarus?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--I have heard your loneliness.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>cruelly and grimly again</i>) So much the more
reason why my pride should kill you! Remember that! (<i>He turns
and strides off into the darkness at right.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>peers after him until sure he is gone--then gets
up and begins a grotesque, hopping dance, singing a verse of the
legionary's song</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bold legionary am I<br>
 March, oh march on!<br>
 A Roman eagle was my daddy<br>
 My mother was a drunken drabby<br>
 Oh march on to the wars!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i>He laughs gratingly, posturing and gesticulating up at
Lazarus.</i>) Ha-ha-ha! He is gone! I can breathe! His breath in
the same air suffocates me! The gods grant mine do the same for
him! But he is failing! He talks to himself like a man in second
childhood. His words are a thick babble I could not hear. They
well from his lips like clots of blood from a reopened wound. I
kept listening to the beating of his heart. It sounded slow,
slower than when I last heard it. Did you detect that, Lazarus?
Once or twice I thought it faltered--(<i>He draws in his breath
with an avid gasp--then laughs gratingly</i>)
Ha-ha-ha--(<i>grandiloquently</i>) Tiberius, the old buck goat,
will soon be gone, my friends, and in his place you will be
blessed with the beautiful young god, Caligula! Hail to Caligula!
Hail! Ha-ha-ha--(<i>His laughter suddenly breaks off into a
whimper and he stands staring around him in a panic of fear that
he has been overheard. He slinks noiselessly up the steps of the
dais and squats coweringly at Lazarus' feet, blinking up at his
face in monkey-wise, clutching Lazarus' hand in both of his. His
teeth can be heard chattering together in nervous fear.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Pompeia, whose gaze has remained fixed on Lazarus'
throughout, has gradually moved closer to him until she, too, is
at his feet, half-kneeling beneath the table on which Miriam
lies, side by side with Caligula but as oblivious of him as he is
of her.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Having grown calmer now, Caligula speaks again--mournful
and bewildered</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--Why should I love you, Lazarus? Your laughter taunts
me! It insults C&aelig;sar! It denies Rome! But I will warn you
again. Escape! Tonight Tiberius' mood is to play sentimental, but
tomorrow he will jeer while hyenas gnaw at your skull and lick
your brain. And then--there is pain, Lazarus! There is pain!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>pressing her hand to her own heart--with a
shudder</i>) Yes, there is pain!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiling down on them--gently</i>) If you can
answer Yes to pain, there is no pain!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>passionately</i>) Yes! Yes! I love Lazarus!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with a bitter grin</i>) Do not take pain away
from us! It is our one truth. Without pain there is nothing--a
nothingness in which even your laughter, Lazarus, is swallowed at
one gulp like a whining gnat by the cretin's silence of
immensity! Ha-ha! No, we must keep pain! Especially C&aelig;sar
must! Pain must twinkle with a mad mirth in a C&aelig;sar's
eyes--men's pain--or they would become dissatisfied and
disrespectful! Ha-ha! (<i>He stops his grating laughter abruptly
and continues mournfully</i>) I am sick, Lazarus, sick of cruelty
and lust and human flesh and all the imbecilities of
pleasure--the unclean antics of half-witted children! (<i>with a
mounting agony of longing</i>) I would be clean! If I could only
laugh your laughter, Lazarus! That would purify my heart. For I
could wish to love all men, as you love them--as I love you! If
only I did not fear them and despise them! If I could only
believe--believe in them--in life--in myself!--believe that one
man or woman in the world knew and loved the real Caligula--then
I might have faith in Caligula myself--then I might laugh your
laughter!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>suddenly, in a quiet but compelling voice</i>) I,
who know you, love you, Caligula. (<i>gently patting his
head</i>) I love Caligula.</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>staring up at him in pathetic confusion</i>)
You? You? You, Lazarus? (<i>He begins to tremble all over as if
in a seizure--chokingly</i>) Beware! It is not good--not just--to
make fun of me--to laugh at my misery--saying you love--(<i>In a
frenzy, he jumps to his feet threatening Lazarus.</i>) Are you
trying to fool me, hypocrite? Do you think I have become so
abject that you dare--? Because I love you, do you presume--? Do
you think I am your slave, dog of a Jew, that you can--insult--to
my face--the heir of C&aelig;sar--(<i>He stutters and stammers
with rage, hopping up and down grotesquely, shaking his fist at
Lazarus, who smiles at him affectionately as at a child in a
tantrum.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>catching his eyes and holding them with his
glance--calmly</i>) Believe, Caligula!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>again overcome--stuttering with strange
terror</i>) Believe? But I cannot! I must not! You cannot know
me, if--You are a holy man! You are a god in a mortal body--you
can laugh with joy to be alive--while I--Oh, no, you cannot love
me! There is nothing in me at bottom but a despising and an evil
eye! You cannot! You are only being kind! (<i>hysterically</i>) I
do not want your kindness! I hate your pity! I am too proud! I am
too strong! (<i>He collapses weepingly, kneeling and clutching
Lazarus' hand in both of his.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>smiling</i>) You are so proud of being evil! What
if there is no evil? What if there are only health and sickness?
Believe in the healthy god called Man in you! Laugh at Caligula,
the funny clown who beats the backside of his shadow with a
bladder and thinks thereby he is Evil, the Enemy of God! (<i>He
suddenly lifts the face of Caligula and stares into his
eyes.</i>) Believe! What if you are a man and men are despicable?
Men are also unimportant! Men pass! Like rain into the sea! The
sea remains! Man remains! Man slowly arises from the past of the
race of men that was his tomb of death! For Man death is not!
Man, Son of God's Laughter, <i>is</i>! (<i>He begins to laugh
triumphantly, staring deep into Caligula's eyes.</i>) <i>Is,</i>
Caligula! Believe in the laughing god within you!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>bursting suddenly into choking, joyful
laughter--like a visionary</i>) I believe! I believe there is
love even for Caligula! I can laugh--now--Lazarus! Free laughter!
Clean! No sickness! No lust for death! My corpse no longer rots
in my heart! The tomb is full of sunlight! I am alive! I who love
Man, I who can love and laugh! Listen, Lazarus! I dream! When I
am C&aelig;sar, I will devote my power to your truth. I will
decree that there must be kindness and love! I will make the
Empire one great Blessed Isle! Rome shall know happiness, it
shall believe in life, it shall learn to laugh your laughter,
Lazarus, or I--(<i>He raises his hand in an imperial autocratic
gesture.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>gaily mocking</i>) Or you will cut off its
head?</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>fiercely</i>) Yes! I will--! (<i>Then meeting
Lazarus' eyes, he beats his head with his fists crazily.</i>)
Forgive me! I forget! I forget!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--Go out under the sky! Let your heart climb on
laughter to a star! Then make it look down at earth, and watch
Caligula commanding Life under pain of death to do his will!
(<i>He laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>laughing</i>) I will! I do! I laugh at him!
Caligula is a trained ape, a humped cripple! Now I take him out
under the sky, where I can watch his monkey tricks, where there
is space for laughter and where this new joy, your love of me,
may dance! (<i>Laughing clearly and exultantly, he runs out
through the arched doorway at rear.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>stops laughing--shaking his head, almost
sadly</i>) They forget! It is too soon for laughter! (<i>then
grinning at himself</i>) What, Lazarus? Are you, too, thinking in
terms of time, old fool so soon to re&euml;nter infinity? (<i>He
laughs with joyous self-mockery.</i>)</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>who has crept to his feet, kisses his hand
passionately</i>) I love you, Lazarus!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>stops laughing, and looks down at her gently</i>)
And I love you, woman.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>with a gasp of delight</i>) You? (<i>She stares
up into his eyes doubtingly, raising her face toward his.</i>)
Then--put your arms around me. (<i>He does so, smiling
gently.</i>) And hold me to you. (<i>He presses her closer to
him.</i>) And kiss me. (<i>He kisses her on the forehead.</i>)
No, on the lips! (<i>He kisses her. She flings her arms about his
neck passionately and kisses him again and again--then slowly
draws away--remains looking into his eyes a long time, shrinking
back from him with bewildered pain which speedily turns to rage
and revengeful hatred.</i>) No! No! It is <i>my</i> love, not
Love! I want you to know <i>my</i> love, to give me back
love--for me--only for me--Pompeia--my body, my heart--me, a
woman--not Woman, women! Do I love Man, men? I hate men! I love
you, Lazarus--a man--a lover--a father to children! I want
love--as you loved that woman there (<i>she points to Miriam</i>)
that I poisoned for love of you! But did you love her--or just
Woman, wife and mother of men? (<i>She stares--then as if reading
admission in his eyes, she springs to her feet.</i>) Liar! Cheat!
Hypocrite! Thief! (<i>Half hysterical with rage, pain and grief,
she bends over Miriam and smooths the hair back from her
forehead.</i>) Poor wife! Poor woman! How he must have tortured
you! Now I remember the pity in your eyes when you looked at me!
Oh, how his soothing gray words must have pecked at the wound in
your heart like doves with bloody beaks! (<i>then with sudden
harshness</i>) But perhaps you were too dull to understand, too
poor and tired and ugly and old to care, too slavish--! Pah!
(<i>She turns away with contempt and faces Lazarus with
revengeful hatred.</i>) Did you think I would take her
place--become your slave, wait upon you, give you love and
passion and beauty in exchange for phrases about man and
gods--you who are neither a man nor a god but a dead thing
without desire! You dared to hope I would give my body, my love,
to you! (<i>She spits in his face and laughs harshly.</i>) You
insolent fool! I shall punish you! You shall be tortured as you
have tortured! (<i>She laughs wildly--then steps down from the
dais and goes off right,</i> <i>crying distractedly</i>)
C&aelig;sar! This man has made you a fool before all the world!
Torture him, C&aelig;sar! Now! Let the people witness! Send
heralds to wake them! Torture him, C&aelig;sar, the man who
laughs at you! Ha-ha-ha-ha! (<i>Her laughter is caught up by all
the girls and youths of the palace, who, as she disappears, led
by their Chorus, pour in from each side of the room and dance
forward to group themselves around the dais as in the previous
scene, staring at Lazarus, laughing cruelly, falsely,
stridently.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>tauntingly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha!<br>
 Laugh now, Lazarus!<br>
 Let us see you laugh!<br>
 Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>echoing</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha!<br>
 Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>moves, and immediately there is silence. He bends
down and kisses Miriam and picks her up in his arms. Talking down
to her face--with a tender smile</i>) Farewell! You are home! And
now I will take your body home to earth! Space is too far away,
you said! Home in the earth! There will be so much for you to do
there! Home! Earth! (<i>his voice trembling a bit</i>) Farewell,
body of Miriam. My grief is a lonely cry wailing in the home in
my heart that you have left forever! (<i>then exultantly</i>) But
what am I? Now your love has become Eternal Love! Now, since your
life passed, I feel Eternal Life made nobler by your
selflessness! Love has grown purer! The laughter of God is more
profoundly tender! (<i>He looks up in an ecstasy and descends the
dais, carrying her.</i>) Yes, that is it! That is it, my Miriam!
(<i>Laughing softly and tenderly, he walks around the dais and
carries the body out through the doorway in rear.</i></p>

<p>(<i>The Chorus and youths and girls make way for him in awed
silence--then scurry around to right and left, forming an aisle
through which he passes--then after he has gone out through the
arch, they close into a semicircular group again, staring after
him, and a whisper of strange, bewildered, tender laughter comes
from them.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>in this whisper</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is it!<br>
 Love is pure!<br>
 Laughter is tender!<br>
 Laugh!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>echoing</i>) Laugh! Laugh!</p>

<p align="CENTER">(<i>Curtain</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="s402">SCENE TWO</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The arena of an amphitheatre. It is just before dawn
of the same night. C&aelig;sar's throne is on the left at the
extreme front, facing right, turned a little toward front. It is
lighted by four immense lamps. In front of the throne is a marble
railing that tops the wall that encloses the arena. In the rear
the towering pile of the circular amphitheatre is faintly
outlined in deeper black against the dark sky.</i></p>

<p><i>Tiberius sits on the throne, his eyes fixed on the middle
of the arena off right, where, bound to a high stake after he had
been tortured, Lazarus is now being burnt alive over a huge pile
of faggots. The crackling of the flames is heard. Their billowing
rise and fall is reflected on the masked faces of the multitude
who sit on the banked tiers of marble behind and to the rear of
the throne, with their Chorus, seven men masked in Middle Age in
the Servile, Hypocritical type, grouped on each side of the
throne of C&aelig;sar on a lower tier.</i></p>

<p><i>Half-kneeling before Tiberius, her chin resting on her
hands on top of the marble rail, Pompeia also stares at
Lazarus.</i></p>

<p><i>Before the curtain, the crackle of the flames and an uproar
of human voices from the multitude, jeering, hooting, laughing at
Lazarus in cruel mockery of his laughter. This sound has risen to
its greatest volume as the curtain rises.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting mockingly</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha!<br>
 Burn and laugh!<br>
 Laugh now, Lazarus!<br>
 Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--(<i>chanting with revengeful mockery</i>)
Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--Who laughs now, Lazarus--thou or C&aelig;sar?
Ha-ha--! (<i>with awe</i>) His flesh melts in the fire but his
eyes shine with peace!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--How he looks at me! (<i>averting her eyes with a
shudder</i>) Command them to put out his eyes, C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>harshly</i>) No. I want to read his eyes when
they see death! (<i>then averting his face--guiltily</i>) He is
looking at me, not you. I should not have listened to your cries
for his death.</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>turning to him again with a shudder of
agony--beseechingly</i>) Have them put out his eyes, C&aelig;sar!
They call to me!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>as if not hearing her--to himself</i>) Why do I
feel remorse? His laughter dies and is forgotten, and the hope it
raised dies--(<i>with sudden excitement</i>) And yet--he must
know something--and if he would--even now he could
tell--(<i>Suddenly rising to his feet he calls imploringly</i>)
Lazarus!</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting in a great imploring chorus now</i>)
Lazarus!</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>echoing</i>) Lazarus!</p>

<p>SOLDIER'S VOICE--(<i>calling from off beside the stake</i>)
You had us gag him, C&aelig;sar, so he might not laugh. Shall we
cut away the gag?</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>in terror</i>) No, C&aelig;sar! He will laugh!
And I will go to him! (<i>desperately</i>) He will laugh at you,
C&aelig;sar--and the mob will laugh with him!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>struggles with himself--then calls</i>) Lazarus!
If you hear let your eyes answer, and I will grant the mercy of
death to end your agony! Is there hope of love somewhere for men
on earth?</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>intoning as before</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there hope of love<br>
 For us on earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hope of love<br>
 For us on earth!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SOLDIER'S VOICE--His eyes laugh, C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>in a strange frenzy now</i>) Hear me, thou
D&aelig;mon of Laughter! Hear and answer, I beseech thee, who
alone hath known joy! (<i>more and more wildly</i>) How must we
live? Wherein lies happiness?</p>

<p>CHORUS--Wherein lies happiness?</p>

<p>CROWD--Wherein, happiness?</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--Why are we born? To what end must we die?</p>

<p>CHORUS--Why are we born to die?</p>

<p>CROWD--Why are we born?</p>

<p>SOLDIER'S VOICE--His eyes laugh, C&aelig;sar! He is dying! He
would speak!</p>

<p>CHORUS AND CROWD--(<i>in one great cry</i>) C&aelig;sar! Let
Lazarus speak!</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>terrified</i>) No, C&aelig;sar! He will
laugh--and you will die--and I will go to him!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>torn--arguing with his fear</i>) But--he may
know some hope--(<i>then making his decision, with grim
fatalism</i>) Hope--or nothing! (<i>calls to the Soldiers</i>)
Let him speak!</p>

<p>CHORUS AND CROWD--(<i>cheering</i>) Hail, C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>His voice comes, recognizably the voice of
Lazarus, yet with a strange, fresh, clear quality of boyhood,
gaily mocking with life.</i>) Hail, C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>frantic with hope</i>) Hail, Lazarus!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--Pull away the fire from him! I see death in his
eyes! (<i>The flaming reflections in the banked, masked faces
dance madly as the Soldiers rake back the fire from the stake.
With a forced, taunting mockery</i>) What do you say now,
Lazarus? You are dying!</p>

<p>CHORUS AND CROWD--(<i>taking his tone--mockingly</i>) You are
dying, Lazarus!</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>his voice a triumphant assertion of the victory
of life over pain and death</i>) Yes!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>triumphant yet disappointed--with scorn and
rage</i>) Ha! You admit it, do you, coward! Craven! Knave! Duper
of fools! Clown! Liar! Die! I laugh at you! Ha-ha-ha-ha--(<i>His
voice breaks chokingly.</i>)</p>

<p>CROWD--(<i>led by their Chorus--in the same frenzy of
disappointment, with all sorts of grotesque and obscene gestures
and noises, thumbing their fingers to their noses, wagging them
at their ears, sticking out their tongues, slapping their
behinds, barking, crowing like roosters, howling, and hooting in
every conceivable manner</i>) Yah! Yah! Yellow Gut! Bungkisser!
Muckheel! Scumwiper! Liar! Pig! Jackal! Die! We laugh at you!
Ha-ha-ha--(<i>Their voices, too, break.</i>)</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>rising to her feet like one in a trance, staring
toward Lazarus</i>) They are tormenting him. I hear him crying to
me! (<i>She moves to the top of the steps leading to the
arena.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>his voice thrilling with exultance</i>) O men,
fear not life! You die--but there is no death for Man! (<i>He
begins to laugh, and at the sound of his laughter, a great spell
of silence settles upon all his hearers--then as his laughter
rises, they begin to laugh with him.</i>)</p>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>descending the steps like a sleep-walker</i>) I
hear his laughter calling. I must go to him.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>as if he realized something was happening that
was against his will--trying feebly to be imperial</i>) I command
you not to laugh! C&aelig;sar commands--(<i>calling feebly to the
Soldiers</i>) Put back--the gag! Stop his laughter! (<i>The
laughter of Lazarus gaily and lovingly mocks back at
him.</i>)</p>

<p>SOLDIER'S VOICE--(<i>his voice gently remonstrating</i>) We
may not, C&aelig;sar. We love his laughter! (<i>They laugh with
him.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS AND CROWD--(<i>in a soft, dreamy murmur</i>) We love
his laughter! We laugh!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>dreamily</i>) Then--pile the fire back around
him. High and higher! Let him blaze to the stars! I laugh with
him!</p>

<p>SOLDIER'S VOICE--(<i>gently and gravely</i>) That is just,
C&aelig;sar. We love men flaming toward the stars! We laugh with
him!</p>

<p>CHORUS AND CROWD--(<i>as the flames, piled back and fed anew
by the Soldiers, flare upward and are reflected on their masks in
dancing waves of light</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We love men flaming toward the stars!<br>
 We laugh!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>POMPEIA--(<i>in the arena</i>) The fire calls me. My burning
heart calls for the fire! (<i>She laughs softly and passes
swiftly across the arena toward Lazarus.</i>)</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>in a sort of childish complaint</i>) You must
pardon me, Lazarus. This is my C&aelig;sar's duty--to kill you!
You have no right to laugh--before all these people--at
C&aelig;sar. It is not kind. (<i>He sobs snuffingly--then begins
to laugh at himself.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Suddenly the flames waver, die down, then shoot up again
and Pompeia's laughter is heard for a moment, rising clear and
passionately with that of Lazarus, then dying quickly
out.</i>)</p>

<p>SOLDIER'S VOICE--A woman has thrown herself in the flames,
C&aelig;sar! She laughs with Lazarus!</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>in a sudden panicky flurry--feverishly</i>)
Quick, Lazarus! You will soon be silent! Speak!--in the name of
man's solitude--his agony of farewell--what is beyond there,
Lazarus? (<i>His voice has risen to a passionate
entreaty.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>in a great pleading echo</i>) What is beyond
there, Lazarus?</p>

<p>CROWD--What is beyond?</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>his voice speaking lovingly, with a surpassing
clearness and exaltation</i>) Life! Eternity! Stars and dust!
God's Eternal Laughter! (<i>His laughter bursts forth now in its
highest pitch of ecstatic summons to the feast and sacrifice of
Life, the Eternal.</i></p>

<p>(<i>The Crowds laugh with him in a frenzied rhythmic chorus.
Led by the Chorus, they pour down from the banked walls of the
amphitheatre and dance in the flaring reflection of the flames
strange wild measures of liberated joy. Tiberius stands on the
raised dais laughing great shouts of clear, fearless
laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS--(<i>chanting as they dance</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 We are stars!<br>
 We are dust!<br>
 We are gods!<br>
 We are laughter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CROWD--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are dust!<br>
 We are gods!<br>
 Laugh! Laugh!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>enters from behind Tiberius. His aspect is wild,
his hair disheveled, his clothes torn, he is panting as if
exhausted by running. He stares toward the flames stupidly--then
screams despairingly above the chant</i>) Lazarus! I come to save
you! Do you still live, Lazarus?</p>

<p>TIBERIUS--(<i>has been speaking. His words are now heard
as</i> <i>the tumult momentarily dies down.</i>) I have lived
long enough! I will die with Lazarus! I no longer fear death! I
laugh! I laugh at C&aelig;sar! I advise you, my brothers, fear
not C&aelig;sars! Seek Man in the brotherhood of the dust!
C&aelig;sar is your fear of Man! I counsel you, laugh away your
C&aelig;sars!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>with resentful jealousy and rage--in a voice
rising to a scream</i>) What do I hear, Lazarus? You laugh with
your murderer? You give him your laughter? You have forgotten
me--my love--you make him love you--you make him laugh at
C&aelig;sars--at me! (<i>suddenly springs on Tiberius in a fury
and grabbing him by the throat chokes him, forcing him back on
the throne--screaming</i>) Die, traitor! Die! (<i>Tiberius' body
relaxes in his hands, dead, and slips from the chair. Caligula
rushes madly down the stairs into the midst of the oblivious,
laughing, dancing crowd, screaming</i>) You have betrayed me, dog
of a Jew! You have betrayed C&aelig;sar! (<i>beginning to be
caught by the contagion of the laughter</i>) Ha-ah--No! I will
not laugh! I will kill you! Give me a spear! (<i>He snatches a
spear from a soldier and fights his way drunkenly toward the
flames, like a man half overcome by a poisonous gas, shouting,
half-laughing in spite of himself, half-weeping with rage.</i>)
Ha-ha--The gods be with C&aelig;sar Caligula! O Immortal Gods,
give thy brother strength! You shall die, Lazarus--die--Ha-ah--!
(<i>He disappears toward the flames, his spear held ready to
stab.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS AND CROWD--(<i>who have been entirely oblivious of
him--chanting</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh! Laugh!<br>
 We are gods!<br>
 We are dust!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>At his first word there is a profound silence in
which each dancer remains frozen in the last movement.</i>) Hail,
Caligula C&aelig;sar! Men forget! (<i>He laughs with gay mockery
as at a child.</i>)</p>

<p>CHORUS AND CROWD--(<i>starting to laugh</i>) Laugh! Laugh!
(<i>Then there is a fierce cry of rage from Caligula and Lazarus'
laughter ceases, and with it the laughter of the Crowd turns to a
wail of fear and lamentation.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>dashes back among them waving his bloody spear
and rushing up to the throne stands on it and strikes a grandiose
pose</i>) I have killed God! I am Death! Death is
C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>CHORUS AND CROWD--<i>-</i>(<i>turning and scurrying
away--huddled in fleeing groups, crouching close to the ground
like a multitude of terrified rats, their voices squeaky now with
fright</i>) Hail, C&aelig;sar! Hail to Death! (<i>They are
gone.</i>)</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>keeping his absurd majestic pose, turns and
addresses with rhetorical intoning, and flowing gestures, the
body of Lazarus, high upon its stake, the flames below it now
flickering fitfully</i>) Hail, Caligula! Hero of heroes,
conqueror of the D&aelig;mon, Lazarus, who taught the treason
that fear and death were dead! But I am Lord of Fear! I am
C&aelig;sar of Death! And you, Lazarus, are carrion! (<i>then in
a more conversational tone, putting aside his grandiose airs,
confidentially</i>) I had to kill you, Lazarus! Surely your good
sense tells you--You heard what the old fool, Tiberius, told the
mob. A moment more and there would have been a revolution--no
more C&aelig;sars--and my dream--! (<i>He
stops--bewilderedly</i>) My dream? Did I kill laughter? I had
just learned to laugh--with love! (<i>more confusedly</i>) I must
be a little mad, Lazarus. It was one terror too many, to have
been laughing your laughter in the night, to have been dreaming
great yearning dreams of all the good my love might do for men
when I was C&aelig;sar--and then, to hear the old howling of mob
lust, and to run here--and there a high white flame amidst the
fire--you, Lazarus!--dying!--laughing with
him--Tiberius--betraying me--who loved you, Lazarus! Yes, I
became mad! I am mad! And I can laugh my own mad laughter,
Lazarus--my own! Ha-ha-ha-ha! (<i>He laughs with a wild
triumphant madness and again rhetorically, with sweeping gestures
and ferocious capers</i>) And all of men are vile and mad, and I
shall be their madmen's C&aelig;sar! (<i>He turns as if
addressing an amphitheatre full of his subjects.</i>) O my good
people, my faithful scum, my brother swine, Lazarus is dead and
we have murdered great laughter, and it befits our madness to
have done so, and it is befitting above all to have Caligula for
C&aelig;sar! (<i>then savagely</i>) Kneel down! Abase yourselves!
I am your C&aelig;sar and your God! Hail! (<i>He stands saluting
himself with a crazy intensity that is not without grandeur. A
pause. Suddenly the silence seems to crush down upon him; he is
aware that he is alone in the vast arena; he whirls about,
looking around him as if he felt an assassin at his back; he
lunges with his spear at imaginary foes, jumping, dodging from
side to side,</i> <i>yelping</i>) Ho, there! Help! Help! Your
C&aelig;sar calls you! Help, my people! To the rescue!
(<i>suddenly throwing his spear away and sinking on his knees,
his face toward Lazarus, supplicatingly</i>) Lazarus! Forgive me!
Help me! Fear kills me! Save me from death! (<i>He is groveling
in a paroxysm of terror, grinding his face in his fists as if to
hide it.</i>)</p>

<p>LAZARUS--(<i>His voice is heard in a gentle, expiring sigh of
compassion, followed by a faint dying note of laughter that rises
and is lost in the sky like the flight of his soul back into the
womb of Infinity.</i>) Fear not, Caligula! There is no death!</p>

<p>CALIGULA--(<i>lifts his head at the first sound and rises with
the laughter to his feet, until, as it is finally lost, he is on
tip-toes, his arms straining upward to the sky, a tender,
childish laughter of love on his lips</i>) I laugh, Lazarus! I
laugh with you! (<i>then grief-stricken</i>) Lazarus! (<i>He
hides his face in his hands, weeping.</i>) No more! (<i>then
beats his head with his fists</i>) I will remember! I will!
(<i>then suddenly, with a return to grotesqueness--harshly</i>)
All the same, I killed him and I proved there is death!
(<i>immediately overcome by remorse, groveling and beating
himself</i>) Fool! Madman! Forgive me, Lazarus! Men forget!</p>
