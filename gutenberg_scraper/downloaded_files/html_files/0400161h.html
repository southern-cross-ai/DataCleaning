<h1>STRANGE INTERLUDE</h1>

<h1><a name="a01" id="a01">FIRST PART</a>
</h1>

<h1>ACT ONE</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>The library of Professor Leeds' home in a small
university town in New England. This room is at the front part of
his house with windows opening on the strip of lawn between the
house and the quiet residential street. It is a small room with a
low ceiling. The furniture has been selected with a love for old
New England pieces. The walls are lined almost to the ceiling with
glassed-in bookshelves. These are packed with books, principally
editions, many of them old and rare, of the ancient classics in the
original Greek and Latin, of the later classics in French and
German and Italian, of all the English authors who wrote while</i>
s <i>was still like an</i> f <i>and a few since then, the most
modern probably being Thackeray. The atmosphere of the room is that
of a cosy, cultured retreat, sedulously built as a sanctuary where,
secure with the culture of the past at his back, a fugitive from
reality can view the present safely from a distance, as a superior
with condescending disdain, pity, and even amusement.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a fair-sized table, a heavy armchair, a rocker, and
an old bench made comfortable with cushions. The table, with the
Professor's armchair at its left, is arranged toward the left of
the room, the rocker is at center, the bench at right.</i>
</p>

<p><i>There is one entrance, a door in the right wall, rear.</i>
</p>

<p><i>It is late afternoon of a day in August. Sunshine, cooled and
dimmed in the shade of trees, fills the room with a soothing
light.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The sound of a maid's voice--a middle-aged woman--explaining
familiarly but respectfully from the right, and Marsden enters. He
is a tall thin man of thirty-five, meticulously well-dressed in
tweeds of distinctly English tailoring, his appearance that of an
Anglicized New England gentleman. His face is too long for its
width, his nose is high and narrow, his forehead broad, his mild
blue eyes those of a dreamy self-analyst, his thin lips ironical
and a bit sad. There is an indefinable feminine quality about him,
but it is nothing apparent in either appearance or act. His manner
is cool and poised. He speaks with a careful ease as one who
listens to his own conversation. He has long fragile hands, and the
stoop to his shoulders of a man weak muscularly, who has never</i>
<i>liked athletics and has always been regarded as of delicate
constitution. The main point about his personality is a quiet
charm, a quality of appealing, inquisitive friendliness, always
willing to listen, eager to sympathize, to like and to be
liked.</i></p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>standing just inside the door, his tall, stooped
figure leaning back against the books--nodding back at the maid and
smiling kindly</i>) I'll wait in here, Mary. (<i>His eyes follow
her for a second, then return to gaze around the room slowly with
an appreciative relish for the familiar significance of the books.
He smiles affectionately and his amused voice recites the words
with a rhetorical resonance.</i>) Sanctum Sanctorum! (<i>His voice
takes on a monotonous musing quality, his eyes stare idly at his
drifting thoughts.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How perfectly the Professor's unique
haven! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He smiles.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Primly classical &hellip; when New
Englander meets Greek! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>looking at the books now</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He hasn't added one book in years
&hellip; how old was I when I first came here? &hellip; six
&hellip; with my father &hellip; father &hellip; how dim his face
has grown! &hellip; he wanted to speak to me just before he died
&hellip; the hospital &hellip; smell of iodoform in the cool halls
&hellip; hot summer &hellip; I bent down &hellip; his voice had
withdrawn so far away &hellip; I couldn't understand him &hellip;
what son can ever understand? &hellip; always too near, too soon,
too distant or too late! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>His face has become sad with a memory of the bewildered
suffering of the adolescent boy he had been at the time of his
father's death. Then he shakes his head, flinging off his thoughts,
and makes himself walk about the room.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What memories on such a smiling
afternoon! &hellip; this pleasant old town after three months
&hellip; I won't go to Europe again &hellip; couldn't write a line
there &hellip; how answer the fierce question of all those dead and
maimed? &hellip; too big a job for me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sighs--then self-mockingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But back here &hellip; it is the
interlude that gently questions &hellip; in this town dozing
&hellip; decorous bodies moving with circumspection through the
afternoons &hellip; their habits affectionately chronicled &hellip;
an excuse for weaving amusing words &hellip; my novels &hellip; not
of cosmic importance, hardly &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then self-reassuringly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">but there is a public to cherish them,
evidently &hellip; and I can write! &hellip; more than one can say
of these modern sex-yahoos! &hellip; I must start work tomorrow
&hellip; I'd like to use the Professor in a novel sometime &hellip;
and his wife &hellip; seems impossible she's been dead six years
&hellip; so aggressively his wife! &hellip; poor Professor! now
it's Nina who bosses him &hellip; but that's different &hellip; she
has bossed me, too, ever since she was a baby &hellip; she's a
woman now &hellip; known love and death &hellip; Gordon brought
down in flames &hellip; two days before the armistice &hellip; what
fiendish irony! &hellip; his wonderful athlete's body &hellip; her
lover &hellip; charred bones in a cage of twisted steel &hellip; no
wonder she broke down &hellip; Mother said she's become quite queer
lately &hellip; Mother seemed jealous of my concern &hellip; why
have I never fallen in love with Nina? &hellip; could I? &hellip;
that way &hellip; used to dance her on my knee &hellip; sit her on
my lap &hellip; even now she'd never think anything about it
&hellip; but sometimes the scent of her hair and skin &hellip; like
a dreamy drug &hellip; dreamy! &hellip; there's the rub! &hellip;
all dreams with me! &hellip; my sex life among the phantoms!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He grins torturedly.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why? &hellip; oh, this digging in gets
nowhere &hellip; to the devil with sex! &hellip; our impotent pose
of today to beat the loud drum on fornication! &hellip; boasters
&hellip; eunuchs parading with the phallus! &hellip; giving
themselves away &hellip; whom do they fool? &hellip; not even
themselves! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>his face suddenly full of an intense pain and
disgust</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ugh! &hellip; always that memory!
&hellip; why can't I ever forget? &hellip; as sickeningly clear as
if it were yesterday &hellip; prep school &hellip; Easter vacation
&hellip; Fatty Boggs and Jack Frazer &hellip; that house of cheap
vice&hellip; one dollar! &hellip; why did I go? &hellip; Jack, the
dead game sport &hellip; how I admired him! &hellip; afraid of his
taunts &hellip; he pointed to the Italian girl &hellip; "Take her!"
&hellip; daring me &hellip; I went &hellip; miserably frightened
&hellip; what a pig she was! &hellip; pretty vicious face under
caked powder and rouge &hellip; surly and contemptuous &hellip;
lumpy body &hellip; short legs and thick ankles &hellip; slums of
Naples &hellip; "What you gawkin' about? Git a move on, kid"
&hellip; kid! &hellip; I <i>was</i> only a kid! &hellip; sixteen
&hellip; test of manhood &hellip; ashamed to face Jack again unless
&hellip; fool! &hellip; I might have lied to him! &hellip; but I
honestly thought that wench would feel humiliated if I &hellip; oh,
stupid kid! &hellip; back at the hotel I waited till they were
asleep &hellip; then sobbed &hellip; thinking of Mother &hellip;
feeling I had defiled her &hellip; and myself &hellip; forever!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>mocking bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">"Nothing half so sweet in life as
love's young dream," what? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He gets to his feet impatiently.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why does my mind always have to dwell
on that? &hellip; too silly &hellip; no importance really &hellip;
an incident such as any boy of my age &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He hears someone coming quickly from the right and turns
expectantly. Professor Leeds enters, a pleased relieved expression
fighting the flurried worry on his face. He is a small, slender man
of fifty-five, his hair gray, the top of his head bald. His face,
prepossessing in spite of its too-small, over-refined features, is
that of a retiring, studious nature. He has intelligent eyes and a
smile that can be ironical. Temperamentally timid, his defense is
an assumption of his complacent, superior manner of the classroom
toward the world at large. This defense is strengthened by a
natural tendency toward a prim provincialism where practical
present-day considerations are concerned (though he is most
liberal--even radical--in his tolerant understanding of the manners
and morals of Greece and Imperial Rome!). This classroom poise of
his, however, he cannot quite carry off outside the classroom.
There is an unconvincing quality about it that leaves his larger
audience--and particularly the Professor himself--subtly
embarrassed. As Marsden is one of his old students, whom, in
addition, he has known from childhood, he is perfectly at ease with
him.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>holding out his hand--with unmistakable liking</i>)
Here I am again, Professor!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>shaking his hand and patting him on the
back--with genuine affection</i>) So glad to see you, Charlie! A
surprise, too! We didn't expect you back so soon! (<i>He sits in
his chair on the left of the table while Marsden sits in the
rocker. Looking away from Marsden a moment, his face now full of
selfish relief as he thinks</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Fortunate, his coming back &hellip;
always calming influence on Nina &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--And I never dreamed of returning so soon. But Europe,
Professor, is the big casualty they were afraid to set down on the
list.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>his face clouding</i>) Yes, I suppose you
found everything completely changed since before the war. (<i>He
thinks resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The war &hellip; Gordon! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--Europe has "gone west"--(<i>he smiles whimsically</i>)
to America, let's hope! (<i>then frowningly</i>) I couldn't stand
it. There were millions sitting up with the corpse already, who had
a family right to be there--(<i>then matter-of-factly</i>) I was
wasting my time, too. I couldn't write a line. (<i>then gaily</i>)
But where's Nina? I must see Nina!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--She'll be right in. She said she wanted to
finish thinking something out--You'll find Nina changed, Charlie,
greatly changed! (<i>He sighs--thinking with a trace of guilty
alarm</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The first thing she said at breakfast
&hellip; "I dreamed of Gordon" &hellip; as if she wanted to taunt
me! &hellip; how absurd! &hellip; her eyes positively glared!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>suddenly blurting out resentfully</i>) She dreams about
Gordon.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looking at him with amused surprise</i>) Well, I'd
hardly call that a change, would you?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking, oblivious to this remark</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I must constantly bear in mind that
she's not herself &hellip; that she's a sick girl &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The morning news of Gordon's death came
&hellip; her face like gray putty &hellip; beauty gone &hellip; no
face can afford intense grief &hellip; it's only later when sorrow
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with concern</i>) Just what do you mean by changed,
Professor? Before I left she seemed to be coming out of that
horrible numbed calm.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>slowly and carefully</i>) Yes, she has
played a lot of golf and tennis this summer, motored around with
her friends, and even danced a good deal. And she eats with a
ravenous appetite. (<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Breakfast &hellip; "dreamed of Gordon"
&hellip; what a look of hate for me in her eyes! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--But that sounds splendid! When I left she wouldn't see
anyone or go anywhere. (<i>thinking pityingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Wandering from room to room &hellip;
her thin body and pale lost face &hellip; gutted, love-abandoned
eyes! &hellip;</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--Well, now she's gone to the opposite extreme!
Sees everyone--bores, fools--as if she'd lost all discrimination or
wish to discriminate. And she talks interminably,
Charlie--intentional nonsense, one would say! Refuses to be
serious! Jeers at everything!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>consolingly</i>) Oh, that's all undoubtedly part of
the effort she's making to forget.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>absent-mindedly</i>) Yes. (<i>arguing with
himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Shall I tell him? &hellip; no &hellip;
it might sound silly &hellip; but it's terrible to be so alone in
this &hellip; if Nina's mother had lived &hellip; my wife &hellip;
dead! &hellip; and for a time I actually felt released! &hellip;
wife! &hellip; helpmeet! &hellip; now I need help! &hellip; no use!
&hellip; she's gone! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>watching him--thinking with a condescending</i>
<i>affection</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Good little man &hellip; he looks
worried &hellip; always fussing about something &hellip; he must
get on Nina's nerves.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>reassuringly</i>) No girl could forget Gordon in a hurry,
especially after the shock of his tragic death.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>irritably</i>) I realize that. (<i>thinking
resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gordon &hellip; always Gordon with
everyone! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--By the way, I located the spot near Sedan where
Gordon's machine fell. Nina asked me to, you know.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>irritated--expostulatingly</i>) For
heaven's sake, don't remind her! Give her a chance to forget if you
want to see her well again. After all, Charlie, life must be lived
and Nina can't live with a corpse forever! (<i>trying to control
his irritation and talk in an objective tone</i>) You see, I'm
trying to see things through clearly and unsentimentally. If you'll
remember, I was as broken up as anyone over Gordon's death. I'd
become so reconciled to Nina's love for him--although, as you know,
I was opposed at first, and for fair reasons, I think, for the boy,
for all his good looks and prowess in sport and his courses, really
came of common people and had no money of his own except as he made
a career for himself.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>a trifle defensively</i>) I'm sure he would have
had a brilliant career.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>impatiently</i>) No doubt. Although you
must acknowledge, Charlie, that college heroes rarely shine
brilliantly in after life. Unfortunately, the tendency to spoil
them in the university is a poor training--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--But Gordon was absolutely unspoiled, I should say.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>heatedly</i>) Don't misunderstand me,
Charlie! I'd be the first to acknowledge--(<i>a bit
pathetically</i>) It isn't Gordon, Charlie. It's his memory, his
ghost, you might call it, haunting Nina, whose influence I have
come to dread because of the terrible change in her attitude toward
me. (<i>His face twitches as if he were on the verge of tears--he
thinks desperately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I've got to tell him &hellip; he will
see that I acted for the best &hellip; that I was justified.
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He hesitates--then blurts out</i>) It may sound incredible,
but Nina has begun to act as if she hated me!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>startled</i>) Oh, come now!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>insistently</i>) Absolutely! I haven't
wanted to admit it. I've refused to believe it, until it's become
too appallingly obvious in her whole attitude toward me! (<i>His
voice trembles.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>moved--expostulating</i>) Oh, now you're becoming
morbid! Why, Nina has always idolized you! What possible
reason--?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>quickly</i>) I can answer that, I think.
She has a reason. But why she should blame me when she must know I
acted for the best--You probably don't know, but just before he
sailed for the front Gordon wanted their marriage to take place,
and Nina consented. In fact, from the insinuations she lets drop
now, she must have been most eager, but at the time--However, I
felt it was ill-advised and I took Gordon aside and pointed out to
him that such a precipitate marriage would be unfair to Nina, and
scarcely honorable on his part.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>staring at him wonderingly</i>) You said that to
Gordon? (<i>thinking cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">A shrewd move! &hellip; Gordon's proud
spot, fairness and honor! &hellip; but was it honorable of you?
&hellip;</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>with a touch of asperity</i>) Yes, I said
it, and I gave him my reason. There <i>was</i> the possibility he
might be killed, in the flying service rather more than a
possibility, which needless to say, I did not point out, but which
Gordon undoubtedly realized, poor boy! If he were killed, he would
be leaving Nina a widow, perhaps with a baby, with no resources,
since he was penniless, except what pension she might get from the
government; and all this while she was still at an age when a girl,
especially one of Nina's charm and beauty, should have all of life
before her. Decidedly, I told him, in justice to Nina, they must
wait until he had come back and begun to establish his position in
the world. That was the square thing. And Gordon was quick to agree
with me!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The square thing! &hellip; but we must
all be crooks where happiness is concerned! &hellip; steal or
starve! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then rather ironically</i>) And so Gordon told Nina he'd
suddenly realized it wouldn't be fair to her. But I gather he
didn't tell her it was your scruple originally?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--No, I asked him to keep what I said strictly
confidential.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking ironically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Trusted to his honor again! &hellip;
old fox! &hellip; poor Gordon! &hellip;</p>

<p>But Nina suspects now that you--?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>startled</i>) Yes. That's exactly it. She
knows in some queer way. And she acts toward me exactly as if she
thought I had deliberately destroyed her happiness, that I had
hoped for Gordon's death and been secretly overjoyed when the news
came! (<i>His voice is shaking with emotion.</i>) And there you
have it, Charlie--the whole absurd mess! (<i>thinking with a
strident accusation</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">And it's true, you contemptible
&hellip; !</p>

<p>(<i>then miserably defending himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No! &hellip; I acted unselfishly
&hellip; for her sake! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>wonderingly</i>) You don't mean to tell me she has
accused you of all this?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--Oh, no, Charlie! Only by
hints--looks--innuendos. She knows she has no real grounds, but in
the present state of her mind the real and the unreal become
confused--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">As always in all minds &hellip; or how
could men live? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>soothingly</i>) That's just what you ought to bear in your
mind--the state of hers--and not get so worked up over what I
should say is a combination of imagination on both your parts.
(<i>He gets to his feet as he hears voices from the right.</i>)
Buck up! This must be Nina coming. (<i>The Professor gets to his
feet, hastily composing his features into his bland, cultured
expression.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking self mockingly but a bit worried about
himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">My heart pounding! &hellip; seeing Nina
again! &hellip; how sentimental &hellip; how she'd laugh if she
knew! &hellip; and quite rightly &hellip; absurd for me to react as
if I loved &hellip; that way &hellip; her dear old Charlie &hellip;
ha! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He smiles with bitter self-mockery.</i>)</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking worriedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hope she won't make a scene &hellip;
she's seemed on the verge all day &hellip; thank God, Charlie's
like one of the family &hellip; but what a life for me! &hellip;
with the opening of the new term only a few weeks off! &hellip; I
can't do it &hellip; I'll have to call in a nerve specialist
&hellip; but the last one did her no good &hellip; his outrageous
fee &hellip; he can take it to court &hellip; I absolutely refuse
&hellip; but if he should bring suit? &hellip; what a scandal
&hellip; no, I'll have to pay &hellip; somehow &hellip; borrow
&hellip; he has me in a corner, the robber! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>enters and stands just inside the doorway looking
directly at her father with defiant eyes, her face set in an
expression of stubborn resolve. She is twenty, tall with broad
square shoulders, slim strong hips and long beautifully developed
legs--a fine athletic girl of the swimmer, tennis player, golfer
type. Her straw-blond hair, framing her sunburned face, is bobbed.
Her face is striking, handsome rather than pretty, the bone
structure prominent, the forehead high, the lips of her rather
large mouth clearly modelled above the firm jaw. Her eyes are
beautiful and bewildering, extraordinarily large and a deep
greenish blue. Since Gordon's death they have a quality of
continually shuddering before some terrible enigma, of being
wounded to their depths and made defiant and resentful by their
pain. Her whole manner, the charged atmosphere she gives off, is
totally at variance with her healthy outdoor physique. It is
strained, nerve-racked, hectic, a terrible tension of will alone
maintaining self-possession. She is dressed in smart sport clothes.
Too preoccupied with her resolve to remember or see Marsden, she
speaks directly to her father in a voice tensely cold and
calm.</i>) I have made up my mind, Father.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking distractedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What does she mean? &hellip; oh, God
help me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>flustered--hastily</i>) Don't you see Charlie, Nina?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>troubled--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She has changed &hellip; what has
happened? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He comes forward toward her--a bit embarrassed but
affectionately using his pet name for her.</i>) Hello, Nina Cara
Nina! Are you trying to cut me dead, young lady?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>turning her eyes to Marsden, holding out her hand for
him to shake, in her cool, preoccupied voice</i>) Hello, Charlie.
(<i>Her eyes immediately return to her father.</i>) Listen,
Father!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>standing near her, concealing his chagrin</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That hurts! &hellip; I mean nothing!
&hellip; but she's a sick girl &hellip; I must make allowance
&hellip;</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking distractedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That look in her eyes! &hellip; hate!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a silly giggle</i>) Really, Nina, you're absolutely
rude! What has Charlie done?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in her cool tone</i>) Why, nothing. Nothing at all.
(<i>She goes to him with a detached, friendly manner.</i>) Did I
seem rude, Charlie? I didn't mean to be. (<i>She kisses him with a
cool, friendly smile.</i>) Welcome home. (<i>thinking
wearily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What has Charlie done? &hellip; nothing
&hellip; and never will &hellip; Charlie sits beside the fierce
river, immaculately timid, cool and clothed, watching the burning,
frozen naked swimmers drown at last.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking torturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Cold lips &hellip; the kiss of
contempt! &hellip; for dear old Charlie! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>forcing a good-natured laugh</i>) Rude? Not a bit!
(<i>banteringly</i>) As I've often reminded you, what can I expect
when the first word you ever spoke in this world was an insult to
me. "Dog" you said, looking right at me--at the age of one! (<i>He
laughs. The Professor laughs nervously. Nina smiles
perfunctorily.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking wearily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The fathers laugh at little daughter
Nina &hellip; I must get away! &hellip; nice Charlie doggy &hellip;
faithful &hellip; fetch and carry &hellip; bark softly in books at
the deep night.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What is she thinking? &hellip; I can't
stand living like this! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>giggle gone to a twitching grin</i>) You are a cool one,
Nina! You'd think you'd just seen Charlie yesterday!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>slowly--coolly and reflectively</i>) Well, the war is
over. Coming back safe from Europe isn't such an unusual feat now,
is it?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">A taunt &hellip; I didn't fight
&hellip; physically unfit &hellip; not like Gordon &hellip; Gordon
in flames &hellip; how she must resent my living! &hellip; thinking
of me, scribbling in press bureau &hellip; louder and louder lies
&hellip; drown the guns and the screams &hellip; deafen the world
with lies &hellip; hired choir of liars! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>forcing a joking tone</i>) Little you know the deadly risks
I ran, Nina! If you'd eaten some of the food they gave me on my
renovated transport, you'd shower me with congratulations! (<i>The
Professor forces a snicker.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>coolly</i>) Well, you're here, and that's that.
(<i>then suddenly expanding in a sweet, genuinely affectionate
smile</i>) And I <i>am</i> glad, Charlie, always glad you're here!
You know that.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>delighted and embarrassed</i>) I hope so, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>turning on her father--determinedly</i>) I must finish
what I started to say, Father. I've thought it all out and decided
that I simply must get away from here at once--or go crazy! And I'm
going on the nine-forty tonight. (<i>She turns to Marsden with a
quick smile.</i>) You'll have to help me pack, Charlie!
(<i>thinking with weary relief</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Now that's said &hellip; I'm going
&hellip; never come back &hellip; oh, how I loathe this room!
&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking with alarm</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's this? &hellip; going? &hellip;
going to whom? &hellip;</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking--terrified</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Going? &hellip; never come back to me?
&hellip; no! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>desperately putting on his prim severe manner toward an
unruly pupil</i>) This is rather a sudden decision, isn't it? You
haven't mentioned before that you were considering--in fact, you've
led me to believe that you were quite contented here--that is, of
course I mean for the time being, and I really think--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looking at Nina--thinking with alarm</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Going away to whom? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then watching the Professor with a pitying shudder</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's on the wrong tack with his
professor's manner &hellip; her eyes seeing cruelly through him
&hellip; with what terrible recognition! &hellip; God, never bless
me with children! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with weary scorn</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The Professor of Dead Languages is
talking again &hellip; a dead man lectures on the past of living
&hellip; since I was born I have been in his class,
loving-attentive, pupil-daughter Nina &hellip; my ears numb with
spiritless messages from the dead &hellip; dead words droning on
&hellip; listening because he is my cultured father &hellip; a
little more inclined to deafness than the rest (let me be just)
because he is my father &hellip; father? &hellip; what is father?
&hellip;</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking--terrified</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must talk her out of it! &hellip;
find the right words! &hellip; oh, I know she won't hear me!
&hellip; oh, wife, why did you die, you would have talked to her,
she would have listened to you! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>continuing in his professor's superior manner</i>)--and I
really think, in justice to yourself above all, you ought to
consider this step with great care before you definitely commit
yourself. First and foremost, there is your health to be taken into
consideration. You've been very ill, Nina, how perilously so
perhaps you're not completely aware, but I assure you, and Charlie
can corroborate my statement, that six months ago the doctors
thought it might be years before--and yet, by staying home and
resting and finding healthy outdoor recreation among your old
friends, and keeping your mind occupied with the routine of
managing the household--(<i>he forces a prim playful smile</i>) and
managing me, I might add!--you have wonderfully improved and I
think it most ill-advised in the hottest part of August, while
you're really still a convalescent--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Talking! &hellip; his voice like a
fatiguing dying tune droned on a beggar's organ &hellip; his words
arising from the tomb of a soul in puffs of ashes &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>torturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ashes! &hellip; oh, Gordon, my dear
one! &hellip; oh, lips on my lips, oh, strong arms around me, oh,
spirit so brave and generous and gay! &hellip; ashes dissolving
into mud! &hellip; mud and ashes! &hellip; that's all! &hellip;
gone! &hellip; gone forever from me! &hellip;</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking angrily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Her eyes &hellip; I know that look
&hellip; tender, loving &hellip; not for me &hellip; damn Gordon!
&hellip; I'm glad he's dead! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>a touch of asperity in his voice</i>) And at a couple of
hours' notice to leave everything in the air, as it were--(<i>then
judicially</i>) No, Nina, frankly, I can't see it. You know I'd
gladly consent to anything in the world to benefit you,
but--surely, you can't have reflected!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking torturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gordon darling, I must go away where I
can think of you in silence! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She turns on her father, her voice trembling with the effort
to keep it in control--icily</i>) It's no use talking, Father. I
<i>have</i> reflected and I am going!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>with asperity</i>) But I tell you it's
quite impossible! I don't like to bring up the money consideration
but I couldn't possibly afford--And how will you support yourself,
if I may ask? Two years in the University, I am sorry to say, won't
be much use to you when applying for a job. And even if you had
completely recovered from your nervous breakdown, which it's
obvious to anyone you haven't, then I most decidedly think you
should finish out your science course and take your degree before
you attempt--(<i>thinking desperately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No use! &hellip; she doesn't hear
&hellip; thinking of Gordon &hellip; she'll defy me &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking desperately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must keep calm &hellip; I mustn't let
go or I'll tell him everything &hellip; and I mustn't tell him
&hellip; he's my father &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with the same cold calculating finality</i>) I've already
had six months' training for a nurse. I will finish my training.
There's a doctor I know at a sanitarium for crippled soldiers--a
friend of Gordon's. I wrote to him and he answered that he'll
gladly arrange it.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking furiously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gordon's friend &hellip; Gordon again!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>severely</i>) You seriously mean to tell me you, in your
condition, want to nurse in a soldiers' hospital! Absurd!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking with indignant revulsion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Quite right, Professor! &hellip; her
beauty &hellip; all those men &hellip; in their beds &hellip; it's
too revolting! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a persuasive quizzing tone</i>) Yes, I must say I can't
see you as a peace-time Florence Nightingale, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>coolly, struggling to keep control, ignoring these
remarks</i>) So you see, Father, I've thought of everything and
there's not the slightest reason to worry about me. And I've been
teaching Mary how to take care of you. So you won't need me at all.
You can go along as if nothing had happened--and really, nothing
will have happened that hasn't already happened.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--Why, even the manner in which you address
me--the tone you take--proves conclusively that you're not
yourself!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>her voice becoming a bit uncanny, her thoughts
breaking through</i>) No, I'm not myself yet. That's just it. Not
all myself. But I've been becoming myself. And I must finish!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>with angry significance--to Marsden</i>)
You hear her, Charlie? She's a sick girl!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>slowly and strangely</i>) I'm not sick. I'm too well.
But they are sick and I must give my health to help them to live
on, and to live on myself. (<i>with a sudden intensity in her
tone</i>) I must pay for my cowardly treachery to Gordon! You
should understand this, Father, you who--(<i>She swallows hard,
catching her breath. Thinking desperately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'm beginning to tell him! &hellip; I
mustn't! &hellip; he's my father! &hellip;</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>in a panic of guilty fear, but
defiantly</i>) What do you mean? I am afraid you're not responsible
for what you're saying.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>again with the strange intensity</i>) I must pay! It's
my plain duty! Gordon is dead! What use is my life to me or anyone?
But I must make it of use--by giving it! (<i>fiercely</i>) I must
learn to give myself, do you hear--give and give until I can make
that gift of myself for a man's happiness without scruple, without
fear, without joy except in his joy! When I've accomplished this
I'll have found myself, I'll know how to start in living my own
life again! (<i>appealing to them with a desperate impatience</i>)
Don't you see? In the name of the commonest decency and honor, I
owe it to Gordon!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>sharply</i>) No, I can't see--nor anyone
else! (<i>thinking savagely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hope Gordon is in hell! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Give herself? &hellip; can she mean her
body? &hellip; beautiful body &hellip; to cripples? &hellip; for
Gordon's sake? &hellip; damn Gordon! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>coldly</i>) What do you mean, you owe it to Gordon,
Nina?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>bitterly</i>) Yes, how ridiculous! It seems
to me when you gave him your love, he got more than he could ever
have hoped--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with fierce self-contempt</i>) I gave him? What did I
give him? It's what I didn't give! That last night before he
sailed--in his arms until my body ached--kisses until my lips were
numb--knowing all that night--something in me knowing he would die,
that he would never kiss me again--knowing this so surely yet with
my cowardly brain lying, no, he'll come back and marry you, you'll
be happy ever after and feel his children at your breasts looking
up with eyes so much like his, possessing eyes so happy in
possessing you! (<i>then violently</i>) But Gordon never possessed
me! I'm still Gordon's silly virgin! And Gordon is muddy ashes! And
I've lost my happiness forever! All that last night I knew he
wanted me. I knew it was only the honorable code-bound Gordon, who
kept commanding from his brain, no, you mustn't, you must respect
her, you must wait till you have a marriage license! (<i>She gives
a mocking laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>shocked</i>) Nina! This is really going too
far!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>repelled--with a superior sneer</i>) Oh, come now,
Nina! You've been reading books. Those don't sound like your
thoughts.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>without looking at him, her eyes on her
father's--intensely</i>) Gordon wanted me! I wanted Gordon! I
should have made him take me! I knew he would die and I would have
no children, that there would be no big Gordon or little Gordon
left to me, that happiness was calling me, never to call again if I
refused! And yet I did refuse! I didn't make him take me! I lost
him forever! And now I am lonely and not pregnant with anything at
all, but--but loathing! (<i>She hurls this last at her
father--fiercely</i>) Why did I refuse? What was that cowardly
something in me that cried, no, you mustn't, what would your father
say?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>thinking--furiously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What an animal! &hellip; and my
daughter! &hellip; she doesn't get it from me! &hellip; was her
mother like that? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>distractedly</i>) Nina! I really can't listen!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>savagely</i>) And that's exactly what my father did
say! Wait, he told Gordon! Wait for Nina till the war's over, and
you've got a good job and can afford a marriage license!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>crumbling pitifully</i>) Nina! I--!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>flurriedly--going to him</i>) Don't take her
seriously, Professor! (<i>thinking with nervous repulsion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Nina has changed &hellip; all flesh now
&hellip; lust &hellip; who would dream she was so sensual? &hellip;
I wish I were out of this! &hellip; I wish I hadn't come here
today! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>coldly and deliberately</i>) Don't lie any more,
Father! Today I've made up my mind to face things. I know now why
Gordon suddenly dropped all idea of marriage before he left, how
unfair to me he suddenly decided it would be! Unfair to me! Oh,
that's humorous! To think I might have had happiness, Gordon, and
now Gordon's child--(<i>then directly accusing him</i>) You told
him it'd be unfair, you put him on his honor, didn't you?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>collecting himself--woodenly</i>) Yes. I
did it for your sake, Nina.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in the same voice as before</i>) It's too late for
lies!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>woodenly</i>) Let us say then that I
<i>persuaded</i> myself it was for your sake. That may be true. You
are young. You think one can live with truth. Very well. It is also
true I was jealous of Gordon. I was alone and I wanted to keep your
love. I hated him as one hates a thief one may not accuse nor
punish. I did my best to prevent your marriage. I was glad when he
died. There. Is that what you wish me to say?</p>

<p>NINA--Yes. Now I begin to forget I've hated you. You were braver
than I, at least.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--I wanted to live comforted by your love until
the end. In short, I am a man who happens to be your father. (<i>He
hides his face in his hands and weeps softly.</i>) Forgive that
man!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking timidly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">In short, forgive us our possessing as
we forgive those who possessed before us &hellip; Mother must be
wondering what keeps me so long &hellip; it's time for tea &hellip;
I must go home &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sadly</i>) Oh, I forgive you. But do you understand
now that I must somehow find a way to give myself to Gordon still,
that I must pay my debt and learn to forgive myself?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--Yes.</p>

<p>NINA--Mary will look after you.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--Mary will do very well, I'm sure.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Nina has changed &hellip; this is no
place for me &hellip; Mother is waiting tea.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then venturing on an uncertain tone of pleasantry</i>) Quite
so, you two. But isn't this all nonsense? Nina will be back with us
in a month, Professor, what with the depressing heat and humidity,
and the more depressing halt and the lame!</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>sharply</i>) She must stay away until she
gets well. This time I do speak for her sake.</p>

<p>NINA--I'll take the nine-forty. (<i>turning to Marsden--with a
sudden girlishness</i>) Come on upstairs, Charlie, and help me
pack! (<i>She grabs him by the hand and starts to pull him
away.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>shrugging his shoulders--confusedly</i>) Well--I
don't understand this!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a strange smile</i>) But some day I'll read it
all in one of your books, Charlie, and it'll be so simple and easy
to understand that I won't be able to recognize it, Charlie, let
alone understand it! (<i>She laughs teasingly.</i>) Dear old
Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking in agony</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">God damn in hell &hellip; dear old
Charlie! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with a genial grin</i>) I'll have to propose, Nina, if
you continue to be my severest critic! I'm a stickler for these
little literary conventions, you know!</p>

<p>NINA--All right. Propose while we pack. (<i>She leads him off,
right.</i>)</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>blows his nose, wipes his eyes, sighs,
clears his throat, squares his shoulders, pulls his coat down in
front,</i> <i>sets his tie straight, and starts to take a brisk
turn about the room. His face is washed blandly clean of all
emotion.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Three weeks now &hellip; new term
&hellip; I will have to be looking over my notes.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He looks out of window, front.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Grass parched in the middle &hellip;

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I am glad we had it out &hellip; his
ghost will be gone now &hellip; no more Gordon, Gordon, Gordon,
love and praise and tears, all for Gordon! &hellip; Mary will do
very well by me &hellip; I will have more leisure and peace of mind

<p>(<i>He calls hoarsely, getting to his feet</i>) Nina!</p>

<p>NINA'S VOICE--(<i>Her voice, fresh and girlish, calls from
upstairs</i>) Yes, Father. Do you want me?</p>

<p>PROFESSOR LEEDS--(<i>struggling with himself--goes to door and
calls with affectionate blandness</i>) No. Never mind. Just wanted
to remind you to call for a taxi in good time.</p>

<p>NINA'S VOICE--I won't forget.</p>

<h1><a name="a02" id="a02">ACT TWO</a>
</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>The same as Scene One, Professor Leeds' study. It is
about nine o'clock of a night in early fall, over a year later. The
appearance of the room is unchanged except that all the shades, of
the color of pale flesh, are drawn down, giving the windows a
suggestion of lifeless closed eyes and making the room seem more
withdrawn from life than before. The reading lamp on the table is
lit. Everything on the table, papers, pencils, pens, etc., is
arranged in meticulous order.</i></p>

<p><i>Marsden is seated on the chair at center. He is dressed
carefully in an English made suit of blue serge so dark as to seem
black, and which, combined with the gloomy brooding expression of
his face, strongly suggests one in mourning. His tall, thin body
sags wearily in the chair, his head is sunk forward, the chin
almost touching his chest, his eyes stare sadly at nothing.</i>
</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>his thoughts at ebb, without emphasis, sluggish and
melancholy</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Prophetic Professor! &hellip; I
remember he once said &hellip; shortly after Nina went away
&hellip; "some day, in here, &hellip; you'll find me" &hellip; did
he foresee? &hellip; no &hellip; everything in life is so
contemptuously accidental! &hellip; God's sneer at our
self-importance! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>smiling grimly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor Professor! he was horribly lonely
&hellip; tried to hide it &hellip; always telling you how
beneficial the training at the hospital would be for her &hellip;
poor old chap!&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>His voice grows husky and uncertain--he controls
it--straightens himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What time is it? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He takes out his watch mechanically and looks at
it.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ten after nine.&nbsp;&hellip; Nina
ought to be here.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with sudden bitterness</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Will she feel any real grief over his
death, I wonder? &hellip; I doubt it! &hellip; but why am I so
resentful? &hellip; the two times I've visited the hospital she's
been pleasant enough &hellip; pleasantly evasive! &hellip; perhaps
she thought her father had sent me to spy on her &hellip; poor
Professor! &hellip; at least she answered his letters &hellip; he
used to show them to me &hellip; pathetically overjoyed &hellip;
newsy, loveless scripts, telling nothing whatever about herself
&hellip; well, she won't have to compose them any more &hellip; she
never answered mine &hellip; she might at least have acknowledged
them.&nbsp;&hellip; Mother thinks she's behaved quite inexcusably
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then jealously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I suppose every single damned inmate
has fallen in love with her! &hellip; her eyes seemed cynical
&hellip; sick with men &hellip; as though I'd looked into the eyes
of a prostitute &hellip; not that I ever have &hellip; except that
once &hellip; the dollar house &hellip; hers were like patent
leather buttons in a saucer of blue milk! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>getting up with a movement of impatience</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The devil! &hellip; what beastly
incidents our memories insist on cherishing! &hellip; the ugly and
disgusting &hellip; the beautiful things we have to keep diaries to
remember! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He smiles with a wry amusement for a second--then
bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That last night Nina was here &hellip;
she talked so brazenly about giving herself &hellip; I wish I knew
the truth of what she's been doing in that house full of men
&hellip; particularly that self-important young ass of a doctor!
&hellip; Gordon's friend! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He frowns at himself, determinedly puts an end to his train
of thought and comes and sits down again in the chair--in sneering,
conversational tones as if he were this time actually addressing
another person</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Really, it's hardly a decent time, is
it, for that kind of speculation &hellip; with her father lying
dead upstairs? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>A silence as if he had respectably squelched himself--then
he pulls out his watch mechanically and stares at it. As he does so
a noise of a car is heard approaching, stopping at the curb beyond
the garden. He jumps to his feet and starts to go to door--then
hesitates confusedly.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, let Mary go &hellip; I wouldn't
know what to do &hellip; take her in my arms? &hellip; kiss her?
&hellip; right now? &hellip; or wait until she? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>A bell rings insistently from the back of the house. From
the front voices are heard, first Nina's, then a man's. Marsden
starts, his face suddenly angry and dejected.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Someone with her! &hellip; a man!
&hellip; I thought she'd be alone! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Mary is heard shuffling to the front door which is opened.
Immediately, as Mary sees Nina, she breaks down and there is the
sound of her uncontrolled sobbing and choking, incoherent words
drowning out Nina's voice, soothing her.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>As Mary's grief subsides a trifle, her voice is heard,
flat and toneless.</i>) Isn't Mr. Marsden here, Mary? (<i>She
calls</i>) Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>confused--huskily</i>) In here--I'm in the study,
Nina. (<i>He moves uncertainly toward the door.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>comes in and stands just inside the doorway. She is
dressed in a nurse's uniform with cap, a raglan coat over it. She
appears older than in the previous scene, her face is pale and much
thinner, her cheek bones stand out, her mouth is taut in hard lines
of a cynical scorn. Her eyes try to armor her wounded spirit with a
defensive stare of disillusionment. Her training has also tended to
coarsen her fiber a trifle, to make her insensitive to suffering,
to give her the nurse's professionally callous attitude. In her
fight to regain control of her nerves she has over-striven after
the cool and efficient poise, but she is really in a more highly
strung, disorganized state than ever, although she is now more
capable of suppressing and concealing it. She remains strikingly
handsome and her physical appeal is enhanced by her pallor and the
mysterious suggestion about her of hidden experience. She stares at
Marsden blankly and speaks in queer flat tones.</i>) Hello,
Charlie. He's dead, Mary says.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>nodding his head several times--stupidly</i>)
Yes.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in same tones</i>) It's too bad. I brought Doctor
Darrell. I thought there might be a chance. (<i>She pauses and
looks about the room--thinking confusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">His books &hellip; his chair &hellip;
he always sat there &hellip; there's his table &hellip; little Nina
was never allowed to touch anything &hellip; she used to sit on his
lap &hellip; cuddle against him &hellip; dreaming into the dark
beyond the windows &hellip; warm in his arms before the fireplace
&hellip; dreams like sparks soaring up to die in the cold dark
&hellip; warm in his love, safe-drifting into sleep &hellip;
"Daddy's girl, aren't you?" &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She looks around and then up and down.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">His home &hellip; my home &hellip; he
was my father &hellip; he's dead &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She shakes her head.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Yes, I hear you, little Nina, but I
don't understand one word of it.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She smiles with a cynical self-contempt.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'm sorry, Father! &hellip; you see
you've been dead for me a long time &hellip; when Gordon died, all
men died &hellip; what did you feel for me then? &hellip; nothing
&hellip; and now I feel nothing &hellip; it's too bad &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking woundedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hoped she would throw herself in my
arms &hellip; weeping &hellip; hide her face on my shoulder
&hellip; "Oh, Charlie, you're all I've got left in the world
&hellip;"</p>

<p>(<i>then angrily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why did she have to bring that Darrell
with her?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>flatly</i>) When I said good-bye that night I had a
premonition I'd never see him again.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>glad of this opening for moral indignation</i>)
You've never tried to see him, Nina! (<i>then overcome by disgust
with himself--contritely</i>) Forgive me! It was rotten of me to
say that!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>shaking her head--flatly</i>) I didn't want him to see
what he would have thought was me. (<i>ironically</i>) That's the
other side of it you couldn't dissect into words from here,
Charlie! (<i>then suddenly asking a necessary question in her
nurse's cool, efficient tones</i>) Is he upstairs? (<i>Marsden nods
stupidly.</i>) I'll take Ned up. I might as well. (<i>She turns and
walks out briskly.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>staring after her--dully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That isn't Nina.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>indignantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">They've killed her soul down there!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Tears come to his eyes suddenly and he pulls out his
handkerchief and wipes them, muttering huskily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor old Professor! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then suddenly jeering at himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">For God's sake, stop acting! &hellip;
it isn't the Professor! &hellip; dear old Charlie is crying because
she didn't weep on his shoulder &hellip; as he had hoped!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He laughs harshly--then suddenly sees a man outside the
doorway and stares--then calls sharply</i>) Who's that?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>his voice embarrassed and hesitating comes from the
hall</i>) It's all right. (<i>He appears in the doorway, grinning
bashfully.</i>) It's me--I, I mean--Miss Leeds told me to come in
here. (<i>He stretches out his hand awkwardly.</i>) Guess you don't
remember me, Mr. Marsden. Miss Leeds introduced us one day at the
hospital. You were leaving just as I came in. Evans is my name.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>who has been regarding him with waning resentment,
forces a cordial smile and shakes hands</i>) Oh, yes. At first I
couldn't place you.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>awkwardly</i>) I sort of feel I'm butting in.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>beginning to be taken by his likable boyish
quality</i>) Not at all. Sit down. (<i>He sits in the rocker at
center as Evans goes to the bench at right. Evans sits
uncomfortably hunched forward, twiddling his hat in his hands. He
is above the medium height, very blond, with guileless, diffident
blue eyes, his figure inclined to immature lumbering outlines. His
face is fresh and red-cheeked, handsome in a boyish fashion. His
manner is bashful with women or older men, coltishly playful with
his friends. There is a lack of self confidence, a lost and strayed
appealing air about him, yet with a hint of some unawakened
obstinate force beneath his apparent weakness. Although he is
twenty-five and has been out of college three years, he still wears
the latest in collegiate clothes and as he looks younger than he
is, he is always mistaken for an undergraduate and likes to be. It
keeps him placed in life for himself.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>studying him keenly--amused</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">This is certainly no giant intellect
&hellip; overgrown boy &hellip; likable quality though &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>uneasy under Marsden's eyes</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Giving me the once-over &hellip; seems
like good egg &hellip; Nina says he is &hellip; suppose I ought to
say something about his books, but I can't even remember a title of
one &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He suddenly blurts out</i>) You've known Nina--Miss
Leeds--ever since she was a kid, haven't you?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>a bit shortly</i>) Yes. How long have you known
her?</p>

<p>EVANS--Well--really only since she's been at the hospital,
although I met her once years ago at a Prom with Gordon Shaw.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>indifferently</i>) Oh, you knew Gordon?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>proudly</i>) Sure thing! I was in his class! (<i>with
admiration amounting to hero-worship</i>) He sure was a wonder,
wasn't he?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gordon &uuml;ber alles and forever!
&hellip; I begin to appreciate the Professor's viewpoint
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>casually</i>) A fine boy! Did you know him well?</p>

<p>EVANS--No. The crowd he went with were mostly fellows who were
good at sports--and I always was a dud. (<i>forcing a smile</i>) I
was always one of the first to get bounced off the squad in any
sport. (<i>then with a flash of humble pride</i>) But I never quit
trying, anyway!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>consolingly</i>) Well, the sport hero usually
doesn't star after college.</p>

<p>EVANS--Gordon did! (<i>eagerly--with intense admiration</i>) In
the war! He was an ace! And he always fought just as cleanly as
he'd played football! Even the Huns respected him!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">This Gordon worshipper must be the
apple of Nina's eye! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>casually</i>) Were you in the army?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>shamefacedly</i>) Yes--infantry--but I never got to
the front--never saw anything exciting. (<i>thinking
glumly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Won't tell him I tried for flying
service &hellip; wanted to get in Gordon's outfit &hellip; couldn't
make the physical exam &hellip; never made anything I wanted
&hellip; suppose I'll lose out with Nina, too &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then rallying himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Hey, you! &hellip; what's the matter
with you? &hellip; don't quit! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>who has been staring at him inquisitively</i>) How
did you happen to come out here tonight?</p>

<p>EVANS--I was calling on Nina when your wire came. Ned thought I
better come along, too--might be of some use.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>frowning</i>) You mean Doctor Darrell? (<i>Evans
nods.</i>) Is he a close friend of yours?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>hesitatingly</i>) Well, sort of. Roomed in the same
dorm with me at college. He was a senior when I was a freshman.
Used to help me along in lots of ways. Took pity on me, I was so
green. Then about a year ago when I went to the hospital to visit a
fellow who'd been in my outfit I ran into him again. (<i>then with
a grin</i>) But I wouldn't say Ned was close to anyone. He's a
dyed-in-the-wool doc. He's only close to whatever's the matter with
you! (<i>He chuckles--then hastily</i>) But don't get me wrong
about him. He's the best egg ever! You know him, don't you?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>stiffly</i>) Barely. Nina introduced us once.
(<i>thinking bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's upstairs alone with her &hellip; I
hoped it would be I who &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Don't want him to get the wrong idea of
Ned &hellip; Ned's my best friend &hellip; doing all he can to help
me with Nina &hellip; he thinks she'll marry me in the end &hellip;
God, if she only would! &hellip; I wouldn't expect her to love me
at first &hellip; be happy only to take care of her &hellip; cook
her breakfast &hellip; bring it up to her in bed &hellip; tuck the
pillows behind her &hellip; comb her hair for her &hellip; I'd be
happy just to kiss her hair! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>agitated--thinking suspiciously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What are Darrell's relations with Nina?
&hellip; close to what's the matter with her? &hellip; damned
thoughts! &hellip; why should I care? &hellip; I'll ask this Evans
&hellip; pump him while I have a chance &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with forced indifference</i>) Is your friend, the Doctor,
"close" to Miss Leeds? She's had quite a lot the matter with her
since her breakdown, if that's what interests him! (<i>He smiles
casually.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>gives a start, awakening from his dream</i>)
Oh--er--yes. He's always trying to bully her into taking better
care of herself, but she only laughs at him. (<i>soberly</i>) It'd
be much better if she'd take his advice.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>suspiciously</i>) No doubt.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>pronounces with boyish solemnity</i>) She isn't
herself, Mr. Marsden. And I think nursing all those poor guys keeps
the war before her when she ought to forget it. She ought to give
up nursing and be nursed for a change, that's my idea.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>struck by this--eagerly</i>) Exactly my opinion.
(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">If she'd settle down here &hellip; I
could come over every day &hellip; I'd nurse her &hellip; Mother
home &hellip; Nina here &hellip; how I could work then!
&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He certainly seems all for me &hellip;
so far! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then in a sudden flurry</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Shall I tell him? &hellip; he'll be
like her guardian now &hellip; I've got to know how he stands
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He starts with a solemn earnestness.</i>) Mr. Marsden,
I--there's something I ought to tell you, I think. You see, Nina's
talked a lot about you. I know how much she thinks of you. And now
her old man--(<i>He hesitates in confusion.</i>) I mean, her
father's dead--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>in a sort of panic--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's this? &hellip; proposal?
&hellip; in form? &hellip; for her hand? &hellip; to me? &hellip;
Father Charlie now, eh? &hellip; ha! &hellip; God, what a fool!
&hellip; does he imagine she'd ever love him? &hellip; but she
might &hellip; not bad looking &hellip; likable, innocent &hellip;
something to mother &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>blundering on regardless now</i>) I know it's hardly
the proper time--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>interrupting--dryly</i>) Perhaps I can anticipate.
You want to tell me you're in love with Nina?</p>

<p>EVANS--Yes, sir, and I've asked her to marry me.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--What did she say?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>sheepishly</i>) Nothing. She just smiled.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with relief</i>) Ah. (<i>then harshly</i>) Well,
what could you expect? Surely you must know she still loves
Gordon?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>manfully</i>) Sure I know it--and I admire her for
it! Most girls forget too easily. She ought to love Gordon for a
long time yet. And I know I'm an awful wash-out compared to
him--but I love her as much as he did, or anyone could! And I'll
work my way up for her--I know I can!--so I can give her everything
she wants. And I wouldn't ask for anything in return except the
right to take care of her. (<i>blurts out confusedly</i>) I never
think of her--that way--she's too beautiful and wonderful--not that
I don't hope she'd come to love me in time--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>sharply</i>) And just what do you expect me to do
about all this?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>taken aback</i>) Why--er--nothing, sir. I just
thought you ought to know. (<i>Sheepishly he glances up at ceiling,
then down at floor, twiddling his hat.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking--at first with a grudging appreciation and
envy</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He thinks he means that &hellip; pure
love! &hellip; it's easy to talk &hellip; he doesn't know life
&hellip; but he might be good for Nina &hellip; if she were married
to this simpleton would she be faithful? &hellip; and then I?
&hellip; what a vile thought! &hellip; I don't mean that!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then forcing a kindly tone</i>) You see, there's really
nothing I can do about it. (<i>with a smile</i>) If Nina will, she
will--and if she won't, she won't. But I can wish you good
luck.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>immediately all boyish gratitude</i>) Thanks! That's
darn fine of you, Mr. Marsden!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--But I think we'd better let the subject drop, don't
you? We're forgetting that her father--</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>guiltily embarrassed</i>) Yes--sure--I'm a damn fool!
Excuse me! (<i>There is the noise of steps from the hall and Doctor
Edmund Darrell enters. He is twenty-seven, short, dark, wiry, his
movements rapid and sure, his manner cool and observant, his dark
eyes analytical. His head is handsome and intelligent. There is a
quality about him, provoking and disturbing to women, of intense
passion which he has rigidly trained himself to control and set
free only for the objective satisfaction of studying his own and
their reactions; and so he has come to consider himself as immune
to love through his scientific understanding of its real sexual
nature. He sees Evans and Marsden, nods at Marsden silently, who
returns it coldly, goes to the table and taking a prescription pad
from his pocket, hastily scratches on it.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking sneeringly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Amusing, these young doctors! &hellip;
perspire with the effort to appear cool! &hellip; writing a
prescription &hellip; cough medicine for the corpse, perhaps!
&hellip; good-looking? &hellip; more or less &hellip; attractive to
women, I dare say.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>tears it off--hands it to Evans</i>) Here, Sam. Run
along up the street and get this filled.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>with relief</i>) Sure. Glad of the chance for a walk.
(<i>He goes out, rear.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>turning to Marsden</i>) It's for Nina. She's got to
get some sleep tonight. (<i>He sits down abruptly in the chair at
center. Marsden unconsciously takes the Professor's place behind
the table. The two men stare at each other for a moment, Darrell
with a frank probing, examining look that ruffles Marsden and makes
him all the more resentful toward him.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">This Marsden doesn't like me &hellip;
that's evident &hellip; but he interests me &hellip; read his books
&hellip; wanted to know his bearing on Nina's case &hellip; his
novels just well-written surface &hellip; no depth, no digging
underneath &hellip; why? &hellip; has the talent but doesn't dare
&hellip; afraid he'll meet himself somewhere &hellip; one of those
poor devils who spend their lives trying not to discover which sex
they belong to! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Giving me the fishy, diagnosing eye
they practice at medical school &hellip; like freshmen from Ioway
cultivating broad A's at Harvard! &hellip; what is his specialty?
&hellip; neurologist, I think &hellip; I hope not psychoanalyst
&hellip; a lot to account for, Herr Freud! &hellip; punishment to
fit his crimes, be forced to listen eternally during breakfast
while innumerable plain ones tell him dreams about snakes &hellip;
pah, what an easy cure-all! &hellip; sex the philosopher's stone
&hellip; "O Oedipus, O my king! The world is adopting you!"
&hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Must pitch into him about Nina &hellip;
have to have his help &hellip; damn little time to convince him
&hellip; he's the kind you have to explode a bomb under to get them
to move &hellip; but not too big a bomb &hellip; they blow to
pieces easily &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>brusquely</i>) Nina's gone to pot again! Not that her
father's death is a shock in the usual sense of grief. I wish to
God it were! No, it's a shock because it's finally convinced her
she can't feel anything any more. That's what she's doing upstairs
now--trying to goad herself into feeling something!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>resentfully</i>) I think you're mistaken. She loved
her father--</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>shortly and dryly</i>) We can't waste time being
sentimental, Marsden! She'll be down any minute, and I've got a lot
to talk over with you. (<i>as Marsden seems again about to
protest</i>) Nina has a real affection for you and I imagine you
have for her. Then you'll want as much as I do to get her
straightened out. She's a corking girl. She ought to have every
chance for a happy life. (<i>then sharply driving his words in</i>)
But the way she's conditioned now, there's no chance. She's piled
on too many destructive experiences. A few more and she'll dive for
the gutter just to get the security that comes from knowing she's
touched bottom and there's no farther to go!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>revolted and angry, half-springs to his feet</i>)
Look here, Darrell, I'll be damned if I'll listen to such a
ridiculous statement!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>curtly--with authority</i>) How do you know it's
ridiculous? What do you know of Nina since she left home? But she
hadn't been nursing with us three days before I saw she really
ought to be a patient; and ever since then I've studied her case.
So I think it's up to you to listen.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>freezingly</i>) I'm listening. (<i>with
apprehensive terror</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gutter &hellip; has she &hellip; I wish
he wouldn't tell me! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How much need I tell him? &hellip;
can't tell him the raw truth about her promiscuity &hellip; he
isn't built to face reality &hellip; no writer is outside of his
books &hellip; have to tone it down for him &hellip; but not too
much! &hellip;</p>

<p>Nina has been giving way more and more to a morbid longing for
martyrdom. The reason for it is obvious. Gordon went away
without--well, let's say marrying her. The war killed him. She was
left suspended. Then she began to blame herself and to want to
sacrifice herself and at the same time give happiness to various
fellow war-victims by pretending to love them. It's a pretty idea
but it hasn't worked out. Nina's a bad actress. She hasn't
convinced the men of her love--or herself of her good intentions.
And each experience of this kind has only left her more a prey to a
guilty conscience than before and more determined to punish
herself!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What does he mean? &hellip; how far did
she? &hellip; how many? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>coldly and sneeringly</i>) May I ask on what specific
actions of hers this theory of yours is based?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>coldly in turn</i>) On her evident craving to make
an exhibition of kissing, necking, petting--whatever you call
it--spooning in general--with any patient in the institution who
got a case on her! (<i>ironically--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Spooning! &hellip; rather a mild word
for her affairs &hellip; but strong enough for this ladylike
soul.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's lying! &hellip; what's he trying
to hide? &hellip; was he one of them? &hellip; her lover? &hellip;
I must get her away from him &hellip; get her to marry Evans!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with authority</i>) Then she mustn't go back to your
hospital, that's certain!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>quickly</i>) You're quite right. And that brings me
to what I want you to urge her to do.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking suspiciously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He doesn't want her back &hellip; I
must have been wrong &hellip; but there might be many reasons why
he'd wish to get rid of her &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>coldly</i>) I think you exaggerate my influence.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>eagerly</i>) Not a bit. You're the last link
connecting her with the girl she used to be before Gordon's death.
You're closely associated in her mind with that period of happy
security, of health and peace of mind. I know that from the way she
talks about you. You're the only person she still respects--and
really loves. (<i>as Marsden starts guiltily and glances at him in
confusion--with a laugh</i>) Oh, you needn't look frightened. I
mean the sort of love she'd feel for an uncle.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking in agony</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Frightened? &hellip; was I? &hellip;
only person she loves &hellip; and then he said "love she'd feel
for an uncle" &hellip; Uncle Charlie now! &hellip; God damn him!
&hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>eyeing him</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Looks damnably upset &hellip; wants to
evade all responsibility for her, I suppose &hellip; he's that kind
&hellip; all the better! &hellip; he'll be only too anxious to get
her safely married.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>bluntly</i>) And that's why I've done all this talking.
You've got to help snap her out of this.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>bitterly</i>) And how, if I may ask?</p>

<p>DARRELL--There's only one way I can see. Get her to marry Sam
Evans.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>astonished</i>) Evans? (<i>He makes a silly gesture
toward the door--thinking confusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Wrong again &hellip; why does he want
her married to &hellip; it's some trick.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--Yes, Evans. He's in love with her. And it's one of
those unselfish loves you read about. And she is fond of him. In a
maternal way, of course--but that's just what she needs now,
someone she cares about to mother and boss and keep her occupied.
And still more important, this would give her a chance to have
children. She's got to find normal outlets for her craving for
sacrifice. She needs normal love objects for the emotional life
Gordon's death blocked up in her. Now marrying Sam ought to do the
trick. Ought to. Naturally, no one can say for certain. But I think
his unselfish love, combined with her real liking for him, will
gradually give her back a sense of security and a feeling of being
worth something to life again, and once she's got that, she'll be
saved! (<i>He has spoken with persuasive feeling. He asks
anxiously</i>) Doesn't that seem good sense to you?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>suspicious--dryly non-committal</i>) I'm sorry but
I'm in no position to say. I don't know anything about Evans, for
one thing.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>emphatically</i>) Well, I do. He's a fine healthy
boy, clean and unspoiled. You can take my word for that. And I'm
convinced he's got the right stuff in him to succeed, once he grows
up and buckles down to work. He's only a big kid now, but all he
needs is a little self-confidence and a sense of responsibility.
He's holding down a fair job, too, considering he's just started in
the advertising game--enough to keep them living. (<i>with a slight
smile</i>) I'm prescribing for Sam, too, when I boost this
wedding.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>his snobbery coming out</i>) Do you know his
family--what sort of people?--</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>bitingly</i>) I'm not acquainted with their social
qualifications, if that's what you mean! They're upstate country
folks--fruit growers and farmers, well off, I believe. Simple,
healthy people, I'm sure of that although I've never met them.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>a bit shamefacedly--changing the subject
hastily</i>) Have you suggested this match to Nina?</p>

<p>DARRELL--Yes, a good many times lately in a half-joking way. If
I were serious she wouldn't listen, she'd say I was prescribing.
But I think what I've said has planted it in her mind as a
possibility.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking suspiciously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Is this Doctor her lover? &hellip;
trying to pull the wool over my eyes? &hellip; use me to arrange a
convenient triangle for him? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>harshly--but trying to force a joking tone</i>) Do you know
what I'm inclined to suspect, Doctor? That you may be in love with
Nina yourself!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>astonished</i>) The deuce you do! What in the devil
makes you think that? Not that any man mightn't fall in love with
Nina. Most of them do. But I didn't happen to. And what's more I
never could. In my mind she always belongs to Gordon. It's probably
a reflection of her own silly fixed idea about him. (<i>suddenly,
dryly and harshly</i>) And I couldn't share a woman--even with a
ghost! (<i>thinking cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Not to mention the living who have had
her! &hellip; Sam doesn't know about them &hellip; and I'll bet he
couldn't believe it of her even if she confessed! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking baffledly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Wrong again! &hellip; he isn't lying
&hellip; but I feel he's hiding something &hellip; why does he
speak so resentfully of Gordon's memory? &hellip; why do I
sympathize? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in a strange mocking ironic tone</i>) I can quite appreciate
your feeling about Gordon. I wouldn't care to share with a
ghost-lover myself. That species of dead is so invulnerably alive!
Even a doctor couldn't kill one, eh? (<i>He forces a laugh--then in
a friendly confidential tone</i>) Gordon is too egregious for a
ghost. That was the way Nina's father felt about him, too.
(<i>suddenly reminded of the dead man--in penitently sad
tones</i>)<i>,</i> You didn't know her father, did you? A charming
old fellow!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>hearing a noise from the hall--warningly</i>) Sstt!
(<i>Nina enters slowly. She looks from one to the other with a
queer, quick, inquisitive stare, but her face is a pale
expressionless mask drained of all emotional response to human
contacts. It is as if her eyes were acting on their own account as
restless, prying, recording instruments. The two men have risen and
stare at her anxiously. Darrell moves back and to one side until he
is standing in relatively the same place as Marsden had occupied in
the previous scene while Marsden is in her father's place and she
stops where she had been. There is a pause. Then just as each of
the men is about to speak, she answers as if they had asked a
question.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in a queer flat voice</i>) Yes, he's dead--my
father--whose passion created me--who began me--he is ended. There
is only his end living--his death. It lives now to draw nearer me,
to draw me nearer, to become my end! (<i>then with a strange
twisted smile</i>) How we poor monkeys hide from ourselves behind
the sounds called words!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How terrible she is! &hellip; who is
she? &hellip; not my Nina! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>as if to reassure himself--timidly</i>) Nina! (<i>Darrell
makes an impatient gesture for him to let her go on. What she is
saying interests him and he feels talking it out will do her good.
She looks at Marsden for a moment startledly as if she couldn't
recognize him.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--What? (<i>then placing him--with real affection that is
like a galling goad to him</i>) Dear old Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Dear damned Charlie! &hellip; She loves
to torture! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then forcing a smile--soothingly</i>) Yes, Nina Cara Nina!
Right here!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>forcing a smile</i>) You look frightened, Charlie. Do
I seem queer? It's because I've suddenly seen the lies in the
sounds called words. You know--grief, sorrow, love, father--those
sounds our lips make and our hands write. You ought to know what I
mean. You work with them. Have you written another novel lately?
But, stop to think, you're just the one who couldn't know what I
mean. With you the lies have become the only truthful things. And I
suppose that's the logical conclusion to the whole evasive mess,
isn't it? Do you understand me, Charlie? Say lie--(<i>She says it,
drawing it out.</i>) L-i-i-e! Now say life. L-i-i-f-e! You see!
Life is just a long drawn out lie with a sniffling sigh at the end!
(<i>She laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>in strange agony</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's hard! &hellip; like a whore!
&hellip; tearing your heart with dirty finger nails! &hellip; my
Nina! &hellip; cruel bitch! &hellip; some day I won't bear it!
&hellip; I'll scream out the truth about every woman! &hellip; no
kinder at heart than dollar tarts! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then in a passion of remorse</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Forgive me, Mother! &hellip; I didn't
mean all! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>a bit worried himself now--persuasively</i>) Why
not sit down, Nina, and let us two gentlemen sit down?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>smiling at him swiftly and mechanically</i>) Oh, all
right, Ned. (<i>She sits at center. He comes and sits on the bench.
Marsden sits by the table. She continues sarcastically.</i>) Are
you prescribing for me again, Ned? This is my pet doctor, Charlie.
He couldn't be happy in heaven unless God called him in because
He'd caught something! Did you ever know a young scientist,
Charlie? He believes if you pick a lie to pieces, the pieces are
the truth! I like him because he's so inhuman. But once he kissed
me--in a moment of carnal weakness! I was as startled as if a mummy
had done it! And then he looked so disgusted with himself! I had to
laugh! (<i>She smiles at him with a pitying scorn.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>good-naturedly smiling</i>) That's right! Rub it
in! (<i>ruffled but amused in spite of it</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'd forgotten about that kiss &hellip;
I was sore at myself afterwards &hellip; she was so damned
indifferent! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>wanderingly</i>) Do you know what I was doing
upstairs? I was trying to pray. I tried hard to pray to the modern
science God. I thought of a million light years to a spiral
nebula--one other universe among innumerable others. But how could
that God care about our trifling misery of death-born-of-birth? I
couldn't believe in Him, and I wouldn't if I could! I'd rather
imitate His indifference and prove I had that one trait at least in
common!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>worriedly</i>) Nina, why don't you lie down?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>jeeringly</i>) Oh, let me talk, Charlie! They're only
words, remember! So many many words have jammed up into thoughts in
my poor head! You'd better let them overflow or they'll burst the
dam! I wanted to believe in any God at any price--a heap of stones,
a mud image, a drawing on a wall, a bird, a fish, a snake, a
baboon--or even a good man preaching the simple platitudes of
truth, those Gospel words we love the sound of but whose meaning we
pass on to spooks to live by!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>again--half-rising--frightenedly</i>) Nina! You
ought to stop talking. You'll work yourself into--(<i>He glances
angrily at Darrell as if demanding that, as a doctor, he do
something.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with bitter hopelessness</i>) Oh, all right!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>answering his look--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">You poor fool! &hellip; it'll do her
good to talk this out of her system &hellip; and then it'll be up
to you to bring her around to Sam &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>starts toward the door</i>) Think I'll go out and stretch my
legs.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking--in a panic</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I don't want to be alone with her!
&hellip; I don't know her! &hellip; I'm afraid! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>protestingly</i>) Well--but--hold on--I'm sure Nina would
rather--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>dully</i>) Let him go. I've said everything I can ever
say--to him. I want to talk to you, Charlie. (<i>Darrell goes out
noiselessly with a meaning look at Marsden--a pause.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking tremblingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Here &hellip; now &hellip; what I hoped
&hellip; she and I alone &hellip; she will cry &hellip; I will
comfort her &hellip; why am I so afraid? &hellip; whom do I fear?
&hellip; is it she? &hellip; or I? &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>suddenly, with pity yet with scorn</i>) Why have you
always been so timid, Charlie? Why are you always afraid? What are
you afraid of?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking in a panic</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She sneaked into my soul to spy!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then boldly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well then, a little truth for once in a
way! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>timidly</i>) I'm afraid of--of life, Nina.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>nodding slowly</i>) I know. (<i>after a
pause--queerly</i>) The mistake began when God was created in a
male image. Of course, women would see Him that way, but men should
have been gentlemen enough, remembering their mothers, to make God
a woman! But the God of Gods--the Boss--has always been a man. That
makes life so perverted, and death so unnatural. We should have
imagined life as created in the birth-pain of God the Mother. Then
we would understand why we, Her children, have inherited pain, for
we would know that our life's rhythm beats from Her great heart,
torn with the agony of love and birth. And we would feel that death
meant reunion with Her, a passing back into Her substance, blood of
Her blood again, peace of Her peace! (<i>Marsden has been listening
to her fascinatedly. She gives a strange little laugh.</i>) Now
wouldn't that be more logical and satisfying than having God a male
whose chest thunders with egotism and is too hard for tired heads
and thoroughly comfortless? Wouldn't it, Charlie?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with a strange passionate eagerness</i>) Yes! It
would, indeed! It would, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>suddenly jumping to her feet and going to him--with a
horrible moaning desolation</i>) Oh, God, Charlie, I want to
believe in something! I want to believe so I can feel! I want to
feel that he is dead--my father! And I can't feel anything,
Charlie! I can't feel anything at all! (<i>She throws herself on
her knees beside him and hides her face in her hands on his knees
and begins to sob--stifled torn sounds.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>bends down, pats her head with trembling hands,
soothes her with uncertain trembling words</i>)
There--there--don't--Nina, please--don't cry--you'll make yourself
sick--come now--get up--do! (<i>His hands grasping her arms he half
raises her to her feet, but, her face still hidden in her hands,
sobbing, she slips on to his lap like a little girl and hides</i>
<i>her face on his shoulder. His expression becomes transported
with a great happiness. In an ecstatic whisper</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">As I dreamed &hellip; with a deeper
sweetness! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He kisses her hair with a great reverence.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There &hellip; this is all my desire
&hellip; I am this kind of lover &hellip; this is my love &hellip;
she is my girl &hellip; not woman &hellip; my little girl &hellip;
and I am brave because of her little girl's pure love &hellip; and
I am proud &hellip; no more afraid &hellip; no more ashamed of
being pure! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He kisses her hair again tenderly and smiles at himself.
Then</i> s<i>oothingly with a teasing incongruous gaiety</i>) This
will never do,</p>

<p>Nina Cara Nina--never, never do, you know--I can't permit
it!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in a muffled voice, her sobbing beginning to ebb away
into sighs--in a young girl's voice</i>) Oh, Charlie, you're so
kind and comforting! I've wanted you so!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>immediately disturbed</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Wanted? &hellip; wanted? &hellip; not
that kind of wanted &hellip; can she mean? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>questioning hesitatingly</i>) You've wanted me, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--Yes,--awfully! I've been so homesick. I've wanted to run
home and 'fess up, tell how bad I've been, and be punished! Oh,
I've got to be punished, Charlie, out of mercy for me, so I can
forgive myself! And now Father dead, there's only you. You will,
won't you--or tell me how to punish myself? You've simply got to,
if you love me!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking intensely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">If I love her! &hellip; oh, I do love
her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>eagerly</i>) Anything you wish, Nina--anything!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a comforted smile, closing her eyes and cuddling
up against him</i>) I knew you would. Dear old Charlie! (<i>as he
gives a wincing start</i>) What is it? (<i>She looks up into his
face.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>forcing a smile--ironically</i>)
Twinge--rheumatics--getting old, Nina. (<i>thinking with wild
agony</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Dear old Charlie! &hellip; descended
again into hell! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then in a flat voice</i>) What do you want to be punished
for, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in a strange, far-away tone, looking up not at him but
at the ceiling</i>) For playing the silly slut, Charlie. For giving
my cool clean body to men with hot hands and greedy eyes which they
called love! Ugh! (<i>A shiver runs over her body.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking with sudden agony</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Then she did! &hellip; the little
filth! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in his flat voice</i>) You mean you--(<i>then
pleadingly</i>) But not--Darrell?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with simple surprise</i>) Ned? No, how could I? The
war hadn't maimed him. There would have been no point in that. But
I did with others--oh, four or five or six or seven men, Charlie. I
forget--and it doesn't matter. They were all the same. Count them
all as one, and that one a ghost of nothing. That is, to me. They
were important to themselves, if I remember rightly. But I
forget.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking in agony</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But why? &hellip; the dirty little
trollop! &hellip; why? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in his flat voice</i>) Why did you do this, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a sad little laugh</i>) God knows, Charlie!
Perhaps I knew at the time but I've forgotten. It's all mixed up.
There was a desire to be kind. But it's horribly hard to give
anything, and frightful to receive! And to give love--oneself--not
in this world! And men are difficult to please, Charlie. I seemed
to feel Gordon standing against a wall with eyes bandaged and these
men were a firing squad whose eyes were also bandaged--and only I
could see! No, I was the blindest! I would not see! I knew it was a
stupid, morbid business, that I was more maimed than they were,
really, that the war had blown my heart and insides out! And I knew
too that I was torturing these tortured men, morbidly
super-sensitive already, that they loathed the cruel mockery of my
gift! Yet I kept on, from one to one, like a stupid, driven animal
until one night not long ago I had a dream of Gordon diving down
out of the sky in flames and he looked at me with such sad burning
eyes, and all my poor maimed men, too, seemed staring out of his
eyes with a burning pain, and I woke up crying, my own eyes
burning. Then I saw what a fool I'd been--a guilty fool! So be kind
and punish me!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking with bitter confusion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I wish she hadn't told me this &hellip;
it has upset me terribly! &hellip; I positively must run home at
once &hellip; Mother is waiting up &hellip; oh, how I'd love to
hate this little whore! &hellip; then I could punish! &hellip; I
wish her father were alive &hellip; "now he's dead there's only
you," she said &hellip; "I've wanted you," &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with intense bitterness</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Dear old Father Charlie now! &hellip;
ha! &hellip; that's how she wants me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then suddenly in a matter-of-fact tone that is mockingly
like her father's</i>) Then, under the circumstances, having
weighed the pros and cons, so to speak, I should say that decidedly
the most desirable course--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>drowsily--her eyes shut</i>) You sound so like Father,
Charlie.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>in the tone like her father's</i>)<i>--</i>is for
you to marry that young Evans. He is a splendid chap, clean and
boyish, with real stuff in him, too, to make a career for himself
if he finds a helpmeet who will inspire him to his best efforts and
bring his latent ability to the surface.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>drowsily</i>) Sam is a nice boy. Yes, it would be a
career for me to bring a career to his surface. I would be
busy--surface life--no more depths, please God! But I don't love
him, Father.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>blandly--in the tone like her father's</i>) But you
like him, Nina. And he loves you devotedly. And it's time you were
having children--and when children come, love comes, you know.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>drowsily</i>) I want children. I must become a mother
so I can give myself. I am sick of sickness.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>briskly</i>) Then it's all settled?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>drowsily</i>) Yes. (<i>very sleepily</i>) Thank you,
Father. You've been so kind. You've let me off too easily. I don't
feel as if you'd punished me hardly at all. But I'll never, never
do it again, I promise--never, never!--(<i>She falls asleep and
gives a soft little snore.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>still in her father's tones--very
paternally--looking down</i>) She's had a hard day of it, poor
child! I'll carry her up to her room. (<i>He rises to his feet with
Nina sleeping peacefully in his arms. At this moment Sam Evans
enters from the right with the package of medicine in his
hand.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>grinning respectfully</i>) Here's the--(<i>as he sees
Nina</i>) Oh! (<i>then excitedly</i>) Did she faint?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>smiling kindly at Evans--still in her father's
tones</i>) Sssh! She's asleep. She cried and then she fell
asleep--like a little girl. (<i>then benignantly</i>) But first we
spoke a word about you, Evans, and I'm sure you have every reason
to hope.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>overcome, his eyes on his shuffling feet and
twiddling cap</i>) Thanks--I--I really don't know how to
thank--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>going to door--in his own voice now</i>) I've got
to go home. My mother is waiting up for me. I'll just carry Nina
upstairs and put her on her bed and throw something over her.</p>

<p>EVANS--Can't I help you, Mr. Marsden?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>dully</i>) No. I cannot help myself. (<i>As Evans
looks puzzled and startled he adds with an ironical, self-mocking
geniality</i>) You'd better call me just Charlie after this. (<i>He
smiles bitterly to himself as he goes out.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>looks after him for a moment--then cannot restrain a
joyful, coltish caper--gleefully</i>) Good egg! Good old Charlie!
(<i>As if he had heard or guessed, Marsden's bitter laugh comes
back from the end of the hallway.</i>)</p>

<p align="center">(<i>Curtain</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a03" id="a03">ACT THREE</a>
</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>Seven months or so later--the dining room of the
Evans' homestead in northern New York state--about nine o'clock in
the morning of a day in late spring of the following year.</i></p>

<p><i>The room is one of those big, misproportioned dining rooms
that are found in the large, jigsaw country houses scattered around
the country as a result of the rural taste for grandeur in the
eighties. There is a cumbersome hanging lamp suspended from chains
over the exact center of the ugly table with its set of
straight-backed chairs set back at spaced intervals against the
walls. The wall paper, a repulsive brown, is stained at the ceiling
line with damp blotches of mildew, and here and there has started
to peel back where the strips join. The floor is carpeted in a
smeary brown with a dark red design blurred into it. In the left
wall is one window with starched white curtains looking out on a
covered side porch, so that no sunlight ever gets to this room and
the light from the window, although it is a beautiful warm day in
the flower garden beyond the porch, is cheerless and sickly. There
is a door in the rear, to left of center, that leads to a hall
opening on the same porch. To the right of door a heavy sideboard,
a part of the set, displaying some "company" china and glassware.
In the right wall, a door leading to the kitchen.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Nina is seated at the foot of the table, her back to the
window, writing a letter. Her whole personality seems changed, her
face has a contented expression, there is an inner calm about her.
And her personal appearance has changed in kind, her face and
figure have filled out, she is prettier in a conventional way and
less striking and unusual; nothing remains of the strange
fascination of her face except her unchangeably mysterious
eyes.</i>
</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>reading what she has just written over to
herself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It's a queer house, Ned. There is
something wrong with its psyche, I'm sure. Therefore you'd simply
adore it. It's a hideous old place, a faded gingerbread with orange
fixin's and numerous lightning rods. Around it are acres and acres
of apple trees in full bloom, all white and pinkish and beautiful,
like brides just tripping out of church with the bridegroom,
Spring, by the arm.</p>

<p>Which reminds me, Ned, that it's over six months since Sam and I
were married and we haven't seen hide nor hair of you since the
ceremony. Do you think that is any nice way to act? You might at
least drop me a line. But I'm only joking. I know how busy you must
be now that you've got the chance you've always wanted to do
research work. Did you get our joint letter of congratulation
written after we read of your appointment?</p>

<p>But to get back to this house. I feel it has lost its soul and
grown resigned to doing without it. It isn't haunted by anything at
all--and ghosts of some sort are the only normal life a house
has--like our minds, you know. So although last evening when we got
here at first I said "obviously haunted" to myself, now that I've
spent one night in it I know that whatever spooks there may once
have been have packed up their manifestations a long time ago and
drifted away over the grass, wisps of mist between the apple trees,
without one backward glance of regret or recollection. It's
incredible to think Sam was born and spent his childhood here. I'm
glad he doesn't show it! We slept last night in the room he was
born in. Or rather he slept, I couldn't. I lay awake and found it
difficult to breathe, as if all the life in the air had long since
been exhausted in keeping the dying living a little longer. It was
hard to believe anyone had ever been born alive there. I know
you're saying crossly "She's still morbid" but I'm not. I've never
been more normal. I feel contented and placid.</p>

<p>(<i>looking up from the letter, thinking embarrassedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Should I have told him? &hellip; no
&hellip; my own secret &hellip; tell no one &hellip; not even Sam
&hellip; why haven't I told Sam? &hellip; it'd do him so much good
&hellip; he'd feel so proud of himself, poor dear &hellip; no
&hellip; I want to keep it just my baby &hellip; only mine &hellip;
as long as I can &hellip; and it will be time enough to let Ned
know when I go to New York &hellip; he can suggest a good
obstetrician &hellip; how delighted he'll be when he hears!
&hellip; he always said it would be the best thing for me &hellip;
well, I do feel happy when I think &hellip; and I love Sam now
&hellip; in a way &hellip; it will be his baby too &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with a happy sigh, turns back to letter</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But speaking of Sam's birth, you really
must meet his mother sometime. It's amazing how little she is like
him, a strange woman from the bit I saw of her last night. She has
been writing Sam regularly once a week ever since she's known we
were married, the most urgent invitations to visit her. They were
really more like commands, or prayers. I suspect she is terribly
lonely all by herself in this big house. Sam's feeling toward her
puzzles me. I don't believe he ever mentioned her until her letters
began coming or that he'd ever have come to see the poor woman if I
hadn't insisted. His attitude rather shocked me. It was just as
though he'd forgotten he had a mother. And yet as soon as he saw
her he was sweet enough. She seemed dreadfully upset to see Charlie
with us, until we'd explained it was thanks to his kindness and in
his car we were taking this deferred honeymoon. Charlie's like a
fussy old woman about his car, he's afraid to let Sam or me drive
it--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>enters from the rear. He is spruce, dressed
immaculately, his face a bit tired and resigned, but smiling
kindly. He has a letter in his hand.</i>) Good morning. (<i>She
gives a start and instinctively covers the letter with her
hand.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--Good morning. (<i>thinking amusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">If he knew what I'd just written
&hellip; poor old Charlie! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then indicating the letter he carries</i>) I see you're an
early correspondent, too.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with sudden jealous suspicion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why did she cover it up like that?
&hellip; whom is she writing to? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>coming toward her</i>) Just a line to Mother to let her know
we've not all been murdered by rum-bandits. You know how she
worries.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with a trace of pitying contempt</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Apron strings &hellip; still his
devotion to her is touching &hellip; I hope if mine is a boy he
will love me as much &hellip; oh, I hope it is a boy &hellip;
healthy and strong and beautiful &hellip; like Gordon! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then suddenly sensing Marsden's
curiosity--perfunctorily</i>) I'm writing to Ned Darrell. I've owed
him one for ages. (<i>She folds it up and puts it aside.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking glumly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I thought she'd forgotten him &hellip;
still I suppose it's just friendly &hellip; and it's none of my
business now she's married.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>perfunctorily</i>) How did you sleep?</p>

<p>NINA--Not a wink. I had the strangest feeling.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--Sleeping in a strange bed, I suppose. (<i>jokingly</i>)
Did you see any ghosts?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a sad smile</i>) No, I got the feeling the ghosts
had all deserted the house and left it without a soul--as the dead
so often leave the living--(<i>she forces a little laugh</i>) if
you get what I mean.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking worriedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Slipping back into that morbid tone
&hellip; first time in a long while &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>teasingly</i>) Hello! Do I hear graveyards yawning from
their sleep--and yet I observe it's a gorgeous morning without, the
flowers are flowering, the trees are treeing with one another, and
you, if I mistake not, are on your honeymoon!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>immediately gaily mocking</i>) Oh, very well, old
thing! "God's in his heaven, all's right with the world!" And
Pippa's cured of the pip! (<i>She dances up to him.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>gallantly</i>) Pippa is certainly a pippin this
morning!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>kisses him quickly</i>) You deserve one for that! All
I meant was that ghosts remind me of men's smart crack about women,
you can't live with them and can't live without them. (<i>stands
still and looks at him teasingly</i>) But there you stand proving
me a liar by every breath you draw! You're ghostless and
womanless--and as sleek and satisfied as a pet seal! (<i>She sticks
out her tongue at him and makes a face of superior scorn.</i>) Bah!
That for you, 'Fraid-cat Charlie, you slacker bachelor! (<i>She
runs to the kitchen door.</i>) I'm going to bum some more coffee!
How about you?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with a forced smile</i>) No, thank you. (<i>She
disappears into the kitchen. Thinking with bitter pain</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ghostless! &hellip; if she only knew
&hellip; that joking tone hides her real contempt! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>self-mockingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">"But when the girls began to play
'Fraid-cat Charlie ran away!"</p>

<p>(<i>then rallying himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Bosh! &hellip; I haven't had such
thoughts &hellip; not since their marriage &hellip; happy in her
happiness &hellip; but is she happy? &hellip; in the first few
months she was obviously playing a part &hellip; kissed him too
much &hellip; as if she'd determined to make herself a loving wife
&hellip; and then all of a sudden she became contented &hellip; her
face filled out &hellip; her eyes lazily examined peace &hellip;
pregnant&hellip; yes, she must be &hellip; I hope so &hellip; why?
&hellip; for her sake &hellip; my own, too &hellip; when she has a
child I know I can entirely accept &hellip; forget I have lost her
&hellip; lost her? &hellip; silly ass! &hellip; how can you lose
what you never possessed? &hellip; except in dreams! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>shaking his head exasperatedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Round and round &hellip; thoughts
&hellip; damn pests! &hellip; mosquitoes of the soul &hellip;
whine, sting, suck one's blood &hellip; why did I invite Nina and
Sam on this tour &hellip; it's a business trip with me, really
&hellip; I need a new setting for my next novel &hellip; "Mr.
Marsden departs a bit from his familiar field" &hellip; well, there
they were stuck in the Professor's house &hellip; couldn't afford a
vacation &hellip; never had a honeymoon &hellip; I've pretended to
be done up every night so they could &hellip; I've gone to bed
right after dinner so they could be alone and &hellip; I wonder if
she can really like him &hellip; that way? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>The sound of Evans' voice and his mother's is heard from the
garden. Marsden goes over and carefully peers out.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Sam with his mother &hellip; peculiar
woman &hellip; strong &hellip; good character for a novel &hellip;
no, she's too somber &hellip; her eyes are the saddest &hellip;
and, at the same time, the grimmest &hellip; they're coming in
&hellip; I'll drive around the country a bit &hellip; give them a
chance for a family conference &hellip; discuss Nina's pregnancy, I
suppose &hellip; does Sam know? &hellip; he gives no indication
&hellip; why do wives hide it from their husbands? &hellip; ancient
shame &hellip; guilty of continuing life, of bringing fresh pain
into the world &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He goes out, rear. The outside door in the hall is heard
being opened and Evans and his mother evidently meet Marsden as he
is about to go out. Their voices, his voice explaining, are heard,
then the outer door being opened and shut again as Marsden departs.
A moment later Evans and his mother enter the dining room. Sam
looks timorously happy, as if he could not quite believe in his
good fortune and had constantly to reassure himself about it, yet
he is riding the crest of the wave, he radiates love and devotion
and boyish adoration. He is a charming-looking fresh boy now. He
wears a sweater and linen knickers, collegiate to the last degree.
His mother is a tiny woman with a frail figure, her head and face,
framed in iron-gray hair, seeming much too large for her body, so
that at first glance she gives one the impression of a wonderfully
made, lifelike doll. She is only about forty-five but she looks at
least sixty. Her face with its delicate features must have once
been of a romantic, tender, clinging-vine beauty, but what has
happened to her has compressed its defenseless curves into planes,
its mouth into the thin line around a locked door, its gentle chin
has been forced out aggressively by a long reliance on clenched
teeth. She is very pale. Her big dark eyes are grim with the
prisoner-pain of a walled-in soul. Yet a sweet loving-kindness, the
ghost of an old faith and trust in life's goodness, hovers
girlishly, fleetingly, about the corners of her mouth and softens
into deep sorrow the shadowy grimness of her eyes. Her voice jumps
startlingly in tone from a caressing gentleness to a blunted flat
assertiveness, as if what she said then was merely a voice on its
own without human emotion to inspire it.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>as they come in--rattling on in the cocksure boastful
way of a boy showing off his prowess before his mother, confident
of thrilled adulation</i>) In a few years you won't have to worry
one way or another about the darned old apple crop. I'll be able to
take care of you then. Wait and see! Of course, I'm not making so
much now. I couldn't expect to. I've only just started. But I'm
making good, all right, all right--since I got married--and it's
only a question of time when--Why, to show you, Cole--he's the
manager and the best egg ever--called me into his office and told
me he'd had his eye on me, that my stuff was exactly what they
wanted, and he thought I had the makings of a real find.
(<i>proudly</i>) How's that? That's certainly fair enough, isn't
it?</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>vaguely--she has evidently not heard much of
what he said</i>) That's fine, Sammy. (<i>thinking
apprehensively</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I do hope I'm wrong! &hellip; but that
old shiver of dread took me the minute she stepped in the door!
&hellip; I don't think she's told Sammy but I got to make
sure.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>seeing her preoccupation now--deeply
hurt--testily</i>) I'll bet you didn't hear a word I said! Are you
still worrying about how the darn old apples are going to turn
out?</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>with a guilty start--protestingly</i>) Yes, I
did hear you, Sammy--every word! That's just what I was thinking
about--how proud I am you're doing so wonderful well!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>mollified but still grumbling</i>) You'd never guess
it from the gloomy way you looked! (<i>but encouraged to go on</i>)
And Cole asked me if I was married--seemed to take a real personal
interest--said he was glad to hear it because marriage was what put
the right kind of ambition into a fellow--unselfish
ambition--working for his wife and not just himself--(<i>then
embarrassedly</i>) He even asked me if we were expecting an
addition to the family.</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>seeing this is her chance--quickly--forcing a
smile</i>) I've been meaning to ask you that myself, Sammy.
(<i>blurts out apprehensively</i>) She--Nina--she isn't going to
have a baby, is she?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>with an indefinable guilty air--as if he were
reluctant to admit it</i>) I--why--you mean, is she now? I don't
think so, Mother. (<i>He strolls over to the window whistling with
an exaggeratedly casual air, and looks out.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>thinking with grim relief</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He don't know &hellip; there's that
much to be thankful for, anyway.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>thinking with intense longing</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">If that'd only happen! &hellip; soon!
&hellip; Nina's begun to love me &hellip; a little &hellip; I've
felt it the last two months &hellip; God, it's made me happy!
&hellip; before that she didn't &hellip; only liked me &hellip;
that was all I asked &hellip; never dared hope she'd come to love
me &hellip; even a little &hellip; so soon &hellip; sometimes I
feel it's too good to be true &hellip; don't deserve it &hellip;
and now &hellip; if that'd happen &hellip; then I'd feel sure
&hellip; it'd be there &hellip; half Nina, half me &hellip; living
proof! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then an apprehensive note creeping in</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">And I know she wants a baby so much
&hellip; one reason why she married me &hellip; and I know she's
felt right along that then she'd love me &hellip; really love me
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>gloomily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I wonder why &hellip; ought to have
happened before this &hellip; hope it's nothing wrong &hellip; with
me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He starts, flinging off this thought--then suddenly
clutching at</i> <i>a straw, turns hopefully to his mother.</i>)
Why did you ask me that, Mother? D'you think--?</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>hastily</i>) No, indeed! I don't think she is! I
wouldn't say so at all!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>dejectedly</i>) Oh--I thought perhaps--(<i>then
changing the subject</i>) I suppose I ought to go up and say hello
to Aunt Bessie.</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>her face becoming defensive--in blunted tones, a
trifle pleadingly</i>) I wouldn't, Sammy. She hasn't seen you since
you were eight. She wouldn't know you. And you're on your
honeymoon, and old age is always sad to young folks. Be happy while
you can! (<i>then pushing him toward door</i>) Look here! You catch
that friend, he's just getting his car out. You drive to town with
him, give me a chance to get to know my daughter-in-law, and call
her to account for how she's taking care of you! (<i>She laughs
forcedly.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>bursting out passionately</i>) Better than I deserve!
She's an angel, Mother! I know you'll love her!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>gently</i>) I do already, Sammy! She's so pretty
and sweet!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>kisses her--joyously</i>) I'll tell her that. I'm
going out this way and kiss her good-bye. (<i>He runs out through
the kitchen door.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>looking after him--passionately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He loves her! &hellip; he's happy!
&hellip; that's all that counts! &hellip; being happy! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>thinking apprehensively</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">If only she isn't going to have a baby
&hellip; if only she doesn't care so much about having one &hellip;
I got to have it out with her &hellip; got to! &hellip; no other
way &hellip; in mercy &hellip; in justice &hellip; this has got to
end with my boy &hellip; and he's got to live happy! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>At the sound of steps from the kitchen she straightens up in
her chair stiffly.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>comes in from the kitchen, a cup of coffee in her
hand, smiling happily</i>) Good morning--(<i>she hesitates--then
shyly</i>) Mother. (<i>She comes over and kisses her--slips down
and sits on the floor beside her.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>flusteredly--hurriedly</i>) Good morning! It's a
real fine day, isn't it? I ought to have been here and got your
breakfast, but I was out gallivanting round the place with Sammy. I
hope you found everything you wanted.</p>

<p>NINA--Indeed I did! And I ate so much I'm ashamed of myself!
(<i>She nods at the cup of coffee and laughs.</i>) See. I'm still
at it.</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--Good for you!</p>

<p>NINA--I ought to apologize for coming down so late. Sam should
have called me. But I wasn't able to get to sleep until after
daylight somehow.</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>strangely</i>) You couldn't sleep? Why? Did you
feel anything funny--about this house?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>struck by her tone--looks up</i>) No. Why?
(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How her face changes! &hellip; what sad
eyes! &hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>thinking in an agony of apprehension</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Got to start in to tell her &hellip;
got to &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>apprehensive herself now</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That sick dead feeling &hellip; when
something is going to happen &hellip; I felt it before I got the
cable about Gordon &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then taking a sip of coffee, and trying to be pleasantly
casual</i>) Sam said you wanted to talk to me.</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>dully</i>) Yes. You love my boy, don't you?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>startled--forcing a smile, quickly</i>) Why, of
course! (<i>reassuring herself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, it isn't a lie &hellip; I do love
him &hellip; the father of my baby &hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>blurts out</i>) Are you going to have a baby,
Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>She presses Mrs. Evans' hand--simply</i>) Yes,
Mother.</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>in her blunt flat tones--with a mechanical
rapidity to her words</i>) Don't you think it's too soon? Don't you
think you better wait until Sammy's making more money? Don't you
think it'll be a drag on him and you? Why don't you just go on
being happy together, just you two?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What is behind what she's saying?
&hellip; that feeling of death again! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>moving away from her--repulsed</i>) No, I don't think any of
those things, Mrs. Evans. I want a baby--beyond everything! We both
do!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>hopelessly</i>) I know. (<i>then grimly</i>) But
you can't! You've got to make up your mind you can't! (<i>thinking
fiercely--even with satisfaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Tell her! &hellip; make her suffer what
I was made to suffer! &hellip; I've been too lonely! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with terrified foreboding</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I knew it! &hellip; Out of a blue sky
&hellip; black! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>springing to her feet--bewilderedly</i>) What do you mean?
How can you say a thing like that?</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>reaching out her hand tenderly, trying to touch
Nina</i>) It's because I want Sammy--and you, too, child--to be
happy. (<i>then as Nina shrinks away from her hand--in her blunted
tones</i>) You just can't.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>defiantly</i>) But I can! I have already! I mean--I
am, didn't you understand me?</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>gently</i>) I know it's hard. (<i>then
inexorably</i>) But you can't go on!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>violently</i>) I don't believe you know what you're
saying! It's too terrible for you--Sam's own mother--how would you
have felt if someone--when you were going to have Sam--came to you
and said--?</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>thinking fiercely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Now's my chance! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>tonelessly</i>) They did say it! Sam's own father did--my
husband! And I said it to myself! And I did all I could, all my
husband could think of, so's I wouldn't--but we didn't know enough.
And right to the time the pains come on, I prayed Sammy'd be born
dead, and Sammy's father prayed, but Sammy was born healthy and
smiling, and we just had to love him, and live in fear. He doubled
the torment of fear we lived in. And that's what you'd be in for.
And Sammy, he'd go the way his father went. And your baby, you'd be
bringing it into torment. (<i>a bit violently</i>) I tell you it'd
be a crime--a crime worse than murder! (<i>then
recovering--commiseratingly</i>) So you just can't, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>who has been listening distractedly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Don't listen to her! &hellip; feeling
of death! &hellip; what is it? &hellip; she's trying to kill my
baby! &hellip; oh, I hate her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>hysterically resentful</i>) What do you mean? Why don't you
speak plainly? (<i>violently</i>) I think you're horrible! Praying
your baby would be born dead! That's a lie! You couldn't!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I know what she's doing now &hellip;
just what I did &hellip; trying not to believe &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>fiercely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I'll make her! &hellip; she's got
to suffer, too! &hellip; I been too lonely! &hellip; she's got to
share and help me save my Sammy! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with an even more blunted flat relentless tonelessness</i>)
I thought I was plain, but I'll be plainer. Only remember it's a
family secret, and now you're one of the family. It's the curse on
the Evanses. My husband's mother--she was an only child--died in an
asylum and her father before her. I know that for a fact. And my
husband's sister, Sammy's aunt, she's out of her mind. She lives on
the top floor of this house, hasn't been out of her room in years,
I've taken care of her. She just sits, doesn't say a word, but
she's happy, she laughs to herself a lot, she hasn't a care in the
world. But I remember when she was all right, she was always
unhappy, she never got married, most people around here were afraid
of the Evanses in spite of their being rich for hereabouts. They
knew about the craziness going back, I guess, for heaven knows how
long. I didn't know about the Evanses until after I'd married my
husband. He came to the town I lived in, no one there knew about
the Evanses. He didn't tell me until after we were married. He
asked me to forgive him, he said he loved me so much he'd have gone
mad without me, said I was his only hope of salvation. So I forgave
him. I loved him an awful lot. I said to myself, I'll be his
salvation--and maybe I could have been if we hadn't had Sammy born.
My husband kept real well up to then. We'd swore we'd never have
children, we never forgot to be careful for two whole years. Then
one night we'd both gone to a dance, we'd both had a little punch
to drink, just enough--to forget--driving home in the
moonlight--that moonlight!--such little things at the back of big
things!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in a dull moan</i>) I don't believe you! I won't
believe you!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>drones on</i>) My husband, Sammy's father, in
spite of all he and I fought against it, he finally gave in to it
when Sammy was only eight, he couldn't keep up any more living in
fear for Sammy, thinking any minute the curse might get him, every
time he was sick, or had a headache, or bumped his head, or started
crying, or had a nightmare and screamed, or said something queer
like children do naturally. (<i>a bit stridently</i>) Living like
that with that fear is awful torment! I know that! I went through
it by his side! It nearly drove me crazy, too--but I didn't have it
in my blood! And that's why I'm telling you! You got to see you
can't, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>suddenly breaking out--frenziedly</i>) I don't believe
you! I don't believe Sam would ever have married me if he
knew--</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>sharply</i>) Who said Sammy knew? He don't know
a single thing about it! That's been the work of my life, keeping
him from knowing. When his father gave up and went off into it I
sent Sammy right off to boarding school. I told him his father was
sick, and a little while after I sent word his father was dead, and
from then on until his father did really die during Sammy's second
year to college, I kept him away at school in winter and camp in
summers and I went to see him, I never let him come home. (<i>with
a sigh</i>) It was hard, giving up Sammy, knowing I was making him
forget he had a mother. I was glad taking care of them two kept me
so busy I didn't get much chance to think then. But here's what
I've come to think since, Nina: I'm certain sure my husband might
have kept his mind with the help of my love if I hadn't had Sammy.
And if I'd never had Sammy I'd never have loved Sammy--or missed
him, would I?--and I'd have kept my husband.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>not heeding this last--with wild mockery</i>) And I
thought Sam was so normal--so healthy and sane--not like me! I
thought he'd give me such healthy, happy children and I'd forget
myself in them and learn to love him!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>horrified, jumping to her feet</i>) Learn to?
You told me you did love Sammy!</p>

<p>NINA--No! Maybe I almost have--lately--but only when I thought
of his baby! Now I hate him! (<i>She begins to weep hysterically.
Mrs. Evans goes to her and puts her arms around her. Nina sobs
out</i>) Don't touch me! I hate you, too! Why didn't you tell him
he must never marry!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--What reason could I give, without telling him
everything? And I never heard about you till after you were
married. Then I wanted to write to you but I was scared he might
read it. And I couldn't leave her upstairs to come away to see you.
I kept writing Sammy to bring you here right off, although having
him come frightened me to death for fear he might get to suspect
something. You got to get him right away from here, Nina! I just
kept hoping you wouldn't want children right away--young folks
don't nowadays--until I'd seen you and told you everything. And I
thought you'd love him like I did his father, and be satisfied with
him alone.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>lifting her head--wildly</i>) No! I don't! I won't!
I'll leave him!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>shaking her, fiercely</i>) You can't! He'd go
crazy sure then! You'd be a devil! Don't you see how he loves
you?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>breaking away from her--harshly</i>) Well, I don't
love him! I only married him because he needed me--and I needed
children! And now you tell me I've got to kill my--oh, yes, I see
I've got to, you needn't argue any more! I love it too much to make
it run that chance! And I hate it too, now, because it's sick, it's
not my baby, it's his! (<i>with terrible ironic bitterness</i>) And
still you can dare to tell me I can't even leave Sam!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>very sadly and bitterly</i>) You just said you
married him because he needed you. Don't he need you now--more'n
ever? But I can't tell you not to leave him, not if you don't love
him. But you oughtn't to have married him when you didn't love him.
And it'll be your fault, what'll happen.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>torturedly</i>) What will happen?--what do you
mean?--Sam will be all right--just as he was before--and it's not
my fault anyway!--it's not my fault! (<i>then thinking
conscience-strickenly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor Sam &hellip; she's right &hellip;
it's not his fault &hellip; it's mine &hellip; I wanted to use him
to save myself &hellip; I acted the coward again &hellip; as I did
with Gordon &hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>grimly</i>) You know what'll happen to him if
you leave him--after all I've told you! (<i>then breaking into
intense pleading</i>) Oh, I'd get down on my knees to you, don't
make my boy run that risk! You got to give one Evans, the last one,
a chance to live in this world! And you'll learn to love him, if
you give up enough for him! (<i>then with a grim smile</i>) Why, I
even love that idiot upstairs, I've taken care of her so many
years, lived her life for her with my life, you might say. You give
your life to Sammy, then you'll love him same as you love yourself.
You'll have to! That's sure as death! (<i>She laughs a queer gentle
laugh full of amused bitterness.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a sort of dull stupid wonderment</i>) And you've
found peace?--</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>sardonically</i>) There's peace in the green
fields of Eden, they say! You got to die to find out! (<i>then
proudly</i>) But I can say I feel proud of having lived fair to
them that gave me love and trusted in me!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>struck--confusedly</i>) Yes--that's true, isn't it?
(<i>thinking strangely</i>)</p>

<p>Lived fair &hellip; pride &hellip; trust &hellip; play the game!
&hellip; who is speaking to me &hellip; Gordon! &hellip; oh,
Gordon, do you mean I must give Sam the life I didn't give you?
&hellip; Sam loved you too &hellip; he said, if we have a boy,
we'll call him Gordon in Gordon's honor &hellip; Gordon's honor!
&hellip; what must I do now in your honor, Gordon? &hellip; yes!
&hellip; I know! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>speaking mechanically in a dull voice</i>) All right,
Mother. I'll stay with Sam. There's nothing else I can do, is
there, when it isn't his fault, poor boy! (<i>then suddenly
snapping and bursting out in a despairing cry</i>) But I'll be so
lonely! I'll have lost my baby! (<i>She sinks down on her knees at
Mrs. Evans' feet--piteously</i>) Oh, Mother, how can I keep on
living?</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>thinking miserably</i>)</p>

<p>Now she knows my suffering &hellip; now I got to help her
&hellip; she's got a right to have a baby &hellip; another baby
&hellip; sometime &hellip; somehow &hellip; she's giving her life
to save my Sammy &hellip; I got to save her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>stammeringly</i>) Maybe, Nina--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>dully and resentfully again now</i>) And how about
Sam? You want him to be happy, don't you? It's just as important
for him as it is for me that I should have a baby! If you know
anything at all about him, you ought to see that!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>sadly</i>) I know that. I see that in him, Nina.
(<i>gropingly</i>) There must be a way--somehow. I remember when I
was carrying Sam, sometimes I'd forget I was a wife, I'd only
remember the child in me. And then I used to wish I'd gone out
deliberate in our first year, without my husband knowing, and
picked a man, a healthy male to breed by, same's we do with stock,
to give the man I loved a healthy child. And if I didn't love that
other man nor him me where would be the harm? Then God would
whisper: "It'd be a sin, adultery, the worst sin!" But after He'd
gone I'd argue back again to myself, then we'd have a healthy
child, I needn't be afraid! And maybe my husband would feel without
ever knowing how he felt it, that I wasn't afraid and that child
wasn't cursed and so he needn't fear and I could save him. (<i>then
scornfully</i>) But I was too afraid of God then to have ever done
it! (<i>then very simply</i>) He loved children so, my poor husband
did, and the way they took to him, you never saw anything like it,
he was a natural born father. And Sammy's the same.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>as from a distance--strangely</i>) Yes, Sammy's the
same. But I'm not the same as you. (<i>defiantly</i>) I don't
believe in God the Father!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>strangely</i>) Then it'd be easy for you.
(<i>with a grim smile</i>) And I don't believe in Him, neither, not
any more. I used to be a great one for worrying about what's God
and what's devil, but I got richly over it living here with poor
folks that was being punished for no sins of their own, and me
being punished with them for no sin but loving much. (<i>with
decision</i>) Being happy, that's the nearest we can ever come to
knowing what's good! Being happy, that's good! The rest is just
talk! (<i>She pauses--then with a strange austere sternness</i>) I
love my boy, Sammy. I could see how much he wants you to have a
baby. Sammy's got to feel sure you love him--to be happy. Whatever
you can do to make him happy is good--is good, Nina! I don't care
what! You've got to have a healthy baby--sometime--so's you can
both be happy! It's your rightful duty!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>confusedly--in a half-whisper</i>) Yes, Mother.
(<i>thinking longingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I want to be happy! &hellip; it's my
right &hellip; and my duty! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then suddenly in guilty agony</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, my baby &hellip; my poor baby &hellip; I'm forgetting you
&hellip; desiring another after you are dead! &hellip; I feel you
beating against my heart for mercy &hellip; oh! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She weeps with bitter anguish.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>gently and with deep sympathy</i>) I know what
you're suffering. And I wouldn't say what I just said now only I
know us two mustn't see each other ever again. You and Sammy have
got to forget me. (<i>as Nina makes a motion of protest--grimly and
inexorably</i>) Oh, yes, you will--easy. People forget everything.
They got to, poor people! And I'm saying what I said about a
healthy baby so's you will remember it when you need to, after
you've forgotten--this one.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sobbing pitifully</i>) Don't! Please, Mother!</p>

<p>MRS. EVANS--(<i>with sudden tenderness--gathering Nina up in her
arms, brokenly</i>) You poor child! You're like the daughter of my
sorrow! You're closer to me now than ever Sammy could be! I want
you to be happy! (<i>She begins to sob, too, kissing Nina's bowed
head.</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a04" id="a04">ACT FOUR</a>
</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>An evening early in the following winter about seven
months later. The Professor's study again. The books in the cases
have never been touched, their austere array shows no gaps, but the
glass separating them from the world is gray with dust, giving them
a blurred ghostly quality. The table, although it is the same, is
no longer the Professor's table, just as the other furniture in the
room, by its disarrangement, betrays that the Professor's
well-ordered mind no longer trims it to his personality. The table
has become neurotic. Volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica mixed
up with popular treatises on Mind Training for Success, etc.,
looking startlingly modern and disturbing against the background of
classics in the original, are slapped helter-skelter on top of each
other on it. The titles of these books face in all directions, no
one volume is placed with any relation to the one beneath it--the
effect is that they have no connected meaning. The rest of the
table is littered with an ink bottle, pens, pencils, erasers, a box
of typewriting paper, and a typewriter at the center before the
chair, which is pushed back, setting the rug askew. On the floor
beside the table are an overflowing wastepaper basket, a few sheets
of paper and the rubber cover for the typewriter like a collapsed
tent. The rocking chair is no longer at center but has been pulled
nearer the table, directly faces it with its back to the bench.
This bench in turn has been drawn much closer, but is now placed
more to the rear and half-faces front, its back squarely to the
door in the corner.</i></p>

<p><i>Evans is seated in the Professor's old chair. He has
evidently been typing, or is about to type, for a sheet of paper
can be seen in the machine. He smokes a pipe, which he is always
relighting whether it needs it or not, and which he bites and
shifts about and pulls in and out and puffs at nervously. His
expression is dispirited, his eyes shift about, his shoulders are
collapsed submissively. He seems much thinner, his face drawn and
sallow. The collegiate clothes are no longer natty, they need
pressing and look too big for him.</i>
</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>turns to his typewriter and pounds out a few words
with a sort of aimless desperation--then tears the sheet out of the
machine with an exclamation of disgust, crumples it up and</i>
<i>throws it violently on the floor, pushing his chair back and
jumping to his feet</i>) Hell! (<i>He begins pacing up and down the
room, puffing at his pipe, thinking tormentedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No use &hellip; can't think of a darn
thing &hellip; well, who could dope out a novel ad on another
powdered milk, anyway? &hellip; all the stuff been used already
&hellip; Tartars conquering on dried mare's milk &hellip;
Metchnikoff, eminent scientist &hellip; been done to death &hellip;
but simply got to work out something or &hellip; Cole said, what's
been the matter with you lately? &hellip; you started off so well
&hellip; I thought you were a real find, but your work's fallen off
to nothing &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sits down on the edge of the bench nearby, his shoulders
hunched--despondently</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Couldn't deny it &hellip; been going
stale ever since we came back from that trip home &hellip; no ideas
&hellip; I'll get fired &hellip; sterile &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a guilty terror</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">in more ways than one, I guess!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He springs to his feet as if this idea were a pin stuck in
him--lighting his already lighted pipe, walks up and down again,
forcing his thoughts into other channels.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Bet the old man turns over in his grave
at my writing ads in his study &hellip; maybe that's why I can't
&hellip; bum influence &hellip; try tomorrow in my bedroom &hellip;
sleeping alone &hellip; since Nina got sick &hellip; some woman's
sickness &hellip; wouldn't tell me &hellip; too modest &hellip;
still, there are some things a husband has a right to know &hellip;
especially when we haven't &hellip; in five months &hellip; doctor
told her she mustn't, she said &hellip; what doctor? &hellip; she's
never said &hellip; what the hell's the matter with you, do you
think Nina's lying? &hellip; no &hellip; but &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>desperately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">If I was only sure it was because she's
really sick &hellip; not just sick of me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sinks down in the rocking chair despondently.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Certainly been a big change in her
&hellip; since that visit home &hellip; what happened between
Mother and her? &hellip; she says nothing &hellip; they seemed to
like each other &hellip; both of them cried when we left &hellip;
still, Nina insisted on going that same day and Mother seemed
anxious to get rid of us &hellip; can't make it out &hellip; next
few weeks Nina couldn't be loving enough &hellip; I never was so
happy &hellip; then she crashed &hellip; strain of waiting and
hoping she'd get pregnant &hellip; and nothing happening &hellip;
that's what did it &hellip; my fault! &hellip; how d'you know?
&hellip; you can't tell that! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He jumps to his feet again--walks up and down again
distractedly.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">God, if we'd only have a kid! &hellip;
then I'd show them all what I could do! &hellip; Cole always used
to say I had the stuff, and Ned certainly thought so. &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with sudden relieved excitement</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">By gosh, I was forgetting! &hellip;
Ned's coming out tonight &hellip; forgot to tell Nina &hellip;
mustn't let her get wise I got him to come to look her over
&hellip; she'd hate me for swallowing my pride after he's never
been to see us &hellip; but I had to &hellip; this has got my goat
&hellip; I've got to know what's wrong &hellip; and Ned's the only
one I can trust &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He flings himself on chair in front of desk and, picking up
afresh sheet of paper, jams it into the machine.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gosh, I ought to try and get a new
start on this before it's time &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He types a sentence or two, a strained frown of
concentration on his face. Nina comes silently through the door and
stands just inside it looking at him. She has grown thin again, her
face is pale and drawn, her movements are those of extreme nervous
tension.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>before she can stifle her immediate reaction of
contempt and dislike</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How weak he is! &hellip; he'll never do
anything &hellip; never give me my desire &hellip; if he'd only
fall in love with someone else &hellip; go away &hellip; not be
here in my father's room &hellip; I even have to give him a home
&hellip; if he'd disappear &hellip; leave me free &hellip; if he'd
die&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>checking herself--remorsefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must stop such thoughts &hellip; I
don't mean it &hellip; poor Sam! &hellip; trying so hard &hellip;
loving me so much &hellip; I give so little in return &hellip; he
feels I'm always watching him with scorn &hellip; I can't tell him
it's with pity &hellip; how can I help watching him? &hellip; help
worrying over his worry because of what it might lead to &hellip;
after what his mother &hellip; how horrible life is! &hellip; he's
worried now &hellip; he doesn't sleep &hellip; I hear him tossing
about &hellip; I must sleep with him again soon &hellip; he's only
home two nights a week &hellip; it isn't fair of me &hellip;I must
try &hellip; I must! &hellip; he suspects my revulsion &hellip;
it's hurting him &hellip; oh, poor dead baby I dared not bear, how
I might have loved your father for your sake! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>suddenly feeling her presence, jerks himself to his
feet--with a diffident guilty air which is noticeable about him now
whenever he is in her presence</i>) Hello, dear. I thought you were
lying down. (<i>guiltily</i>) Did the noise of my typing bother
you? I'm terribly sorry!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>irritated in spite of herself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why is he always cringing? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She comes forward to the chair at center and sits
down--forcing a smile</i>) But there's nothing to be terribly sorry
about! (<i>As he stands awkward and confused, like a schoolboy who
has been called on to recite and cannot and is being "bawled out"
before the class, she forces a playful tone.</i>) Goodness, Sam,
how tragic you can get about nothing at all!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>still forced to justify himself--contritely</i>) I
know it isn't pleasant for you having me drag my work out here,
trying to pound out rotten ads. (<i>with a short laugh</i>) Trying
to is right! (<i>blurts out</i>) I wouldn't do it except that Cole
gave me a warning to buck up--or get out.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>stares at him, more annoyed, her eyes hardening,
thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Yes! &hellip; he'll always be losing
one job, getting another, starting with a burst of confidence each
time, then &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>cutting him with a careless sneering tone</i>) Well, it
isn't a job to worry much about losing, is it?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>wincing pitiably</i>) No, not much money. But I used
to think there was a fine chance to rise there--but of course
that's my fault, I haven't made good--(<i>he finishes
miserably</i>) somehow.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>her antagonism giving way to remorseful pity</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What makes me so cruel? &hellip; he's
so defenseless &hellip; his mother's baby &hellip; poor sick baby!
&hellip; poor Sam! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She jumps to her feet and goes over to him.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>as she comes--with a defensive, boastful bravery</i>)
Oh, I can get another job just as good, all right--maybe a lot
better.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>reassuringly</i>) Certainly, you can! And I'm sure
you're not going to lose this one. You're always anticipating
trouble. (<i>She kisses him and sits on the arm of his chair,
putting an arm around his neck and pulling his head on to her
breast.</i>) And it isn't your fault, you big goose, you! It's
mine. I know how hard it makes everything for you, being tied to a
wife who's too sick to be a wife. You ought to have married a big
strapping, motherly--</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>in the seventh heaven now--passionately</i>) Bunk!
All the other women in the world aren't worth your little finger!
It's you who ought to have married someone worth while, not a poor
fish like me! But no one could love you more than I do, no matter
what he was!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>presses his head on her breast, avoiding his eyes,
kisses him on the forehead</i>) And I love you, Sam. (<i>staring
out over his head--with loving pity, thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I almost do &hellip; poor unfortunate
boy! &hellip; at these moments &hellip; as his mother loves him
&hellip; but that isn't enough for him &hellip; I can hear his
mother saying, "Sammy's got to feel sure you love him &hellip; to
be happy." &hellip; I must try to make him feel sure &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>speaking gently</i>) I want you to be happy, Sam.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>his face transformed with happiness</i>) I am--a
hundred times more than I deserve!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>presses his head down on her breast so he cannot see
her eyes--gently</i>) Ssshh. (<i>thinking sadly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I promised her &hellip; but I couldn't
see how hard it would be to let him love me &hellip; after his baby
&hellip; was gone &hellip; it was hard even to keep on living
&hellip; after that operation &hellip; Gordon's spirit followed me
from room to room &hellip; poor reproachful ghost! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with bitter mockery</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, Gordon, I'm afraid this is a deeper
point of honor than any that was ever shot down in flames! &hellip;
what would your honor say now? &hellip; "Stick to him! &hellip;
play the game!" &hellip; oh, yes, I know &hellip; I'm sticking
&hellip; but he isn't happy &hellip; I'm trying to play the game
&hellip; then why do I keep myself from him? &hellip; but I was
really sick &hellip; for a time after &hellip; since then, I
couldn't &hellip; but &hellip; oh, I'll try &hellip; I'll try soon
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>tenderly--but having to force herself to say it</i>) Doesn't
my boy want to sleep with me again--sometime soon?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>passionately--hardly able to believe his ears</i>)
Oh, it'd be wonderful, Nina! But are you sure you really want me
to--that you'll feel well enough?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>repeats his words as if she were memorizing a
lesson</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, I want you to. Yes, I'll feel well enough. (<i>He seizes
her</i> <i>hand and kisses it in a passionately grateful silence.
She thinks</i> <i>with resigned finality</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There, Sammy's mother and Gordon
&hellip; I'll play the game &hellip; it will make him happy for a
while &hellip; as he was in those weeks after we'd left his mother
&hellip; when I gave myself with a mad pleasure in torturing myself
for his pleasure! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with weary hopelessness</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He'll be happy until he begins to feel
guilty again because I'm not pregnant &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a grim bitter smile</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor Sam, if he only knew the
precautions &hellip; as if I wouldn't die rather than take the
slightest chance of that happening! &hellip; ever again &hellip;
what a tragic joke it was on both of us! &hellip; I wanted my baby
so! &hellip; oh, God! &hellip; his mother said &hellip; "You've got
to have a healthy baby &hellip; sometime &hellip; it's your
rightful duty" &hellip; that seemed right then &hellip; but now
&hellip; it seems cowardly &hellip; to betray poor Sam &hellip; and
vile to give myself &hellip; without love or desire &hellip; and
yet I've given myself to men before without a thought, just to give
them a moment's happiness &hellip; can't I do that again? &hellip;
when it's a case of Sam's happiness? &hellip; and my own?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She gets up from beside him with a hunted movement.</i>) It
must be half past eight. Charlie's coming to bring his suggestions
on my outline for Gordon's biography.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>his bliss shattered--dejectedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Always happens &hellip; just as we get
close &hellip; something comes between &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then confusedly</i>) Say, I forgot to tell you Ned's coming
out tonight.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>astonished</i>) Ned Darrell?</p>

<p>EVANS--Sure. I happened to run into him the other day and
invited him and he said Saturday evening. He couldn't tell what
train. Said never mind meeting him.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>excitedly</i>) Why didn't you tell me before, you big
booby! (<i>She kisses him.</i>) There, don't mind. But it's just
like you. Now someone'll have to go down to the store. And I'll
have to get the spare room ready. (<i>She hurries to the doorway.
He follows her.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--I'll help you.</p>

<p>NINA--You'll do nothing of the kind! You'll stay right
downstairs and bring them in here and cover up my absence. Thank
heavens, Charlie won't stay long if Ned is here. (<i>The doorbell
rings--excitedly</i>) There's one of them now. I'll run upstairs.
Come up and tell me if it's Ned--and get rid of Charlie. (<i>She
kisses him playfully and hurries out.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>looking after her--thinks</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She seems better tonight &hellip;
happier &hellip; she seems to love me &hellip; if she'll only get
all well again, then everything will &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>The bell rings again.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must give Ned a good chance to talk
to her &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He goes out to the outer door--returns a moment later with
Marsden. The latter's manner is preoccupied and nervous. His face
has an expression of anxiety which he tries to conceal. He seems a
prey to some inner fear he is trying to hide even from himself and
is resolutely warding off from his consciousness. His tall, thin
body stoops as if a part of its sustaining will had been
removed.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>with a rather forced welcoming note</i>) Come on in,
Charlie. Nina's upstairs lying down.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with marked relief</i>) Then by all means don't
disturb her. I just dropped in to bring back her outline with the
suggestions I've made. (<i>He has taken some papers out of his
pocket and hands them to Evans.</i>) I couldn't have stayed but a
minute in any event. Mother is a bit under the weather these
days.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>perfunctorily</i>) Too bad. (<i>thinking
vindictively</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Serve her right, the old
scandal-monger, after the way she's gossiped about Nina!
&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with assumed carelessness</i>) Just a little
indigestion. Nothing serious but it annoys her terribly.
(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That dull pain she complains of
&hellip; I don't like it &hellip; and she won't see anyone but old
Doctor Tibbetts &hellip; she's sixty-eight &hellip; I can't help
fearing &hellip; no! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>bored--vaguely</i>) Well, I suppose you've got to be
careful of every little thing when you get to her age.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>positively bristling</i>) Her age? Mother isn't so
old!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>surprised</i>) Over sixty-five, isn't she?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>indignantly</i>) You're quite out there! She's
still under sixty-five--and in health and spirits she isn't more
than fifty! Everyone remarks that! (<i>annoyed at himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why did I lie to him about her age?
&hellip; I must be on edge &hellip; Mother is rather difficult to
live with these days, getting me worried to death, when it's
probably nothing &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>annoyed in his turn--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why all the fuss? &hellip; as if I gave
a damn if the old girl was a million! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>indicating the papers</i>) I'll give these to Nina first
thing in the morning.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>mechanically</i>) Righto. Thank you. (<i>He starts
to go toward door--then turns--fussily</i>) But you'd better take a
look while I'm here and see if it's clear. I've written on the
margins. See if there's anything you can't make out. (<i>Evans nods
helplessly and begins reading the sheets, going back beneath the
lamp.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looking around him with squeamish
disapproval</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a mess they've made of this study
&hellip; poor Professor! &hellip; dead and forgotten &hellip; and
his tomb desecrated &hellip; does Sam write his ads here of a
weekend now? &hellip; the last touch! &hellip; and Nina labors with
love at Gordon's biography &hellip; whom the Professor hated!
&hellip; "life is so full of a number of things!" &hellip; why does
everyone in the world think they can write? &hellip; but I've only
myself to blame &hellip; why in the devil did I ever suggest it to
her? &hellip; because I hoped my helping her while Sam was in the
city would bring us alone together? &hellip; but I made the
suggestion before she had that abortion performed! &hellip; how do
you know she did? &hellip; because I know! &hellip; there are
psychic affinities &hellip; her body confessed &hellip; and since
then, I've felt an aversion &hellip; as if she were a criminal
&hellip; she is! &hellip; how could she? &hellip; why? &hellip; I
thought she wanted a child &hellip; but evidently I don't know her
&hellip; I suppose, afraid it would spoil her figure &hellip; her
flesh &hellip; her power to enslave men's senses &hellip; mine
&hellip; and I had hoped &hellip; looked forward to her becoming a
mother &hellip; for my peace of mind.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>catching himself--violently</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Shut up! &hellip; what a base creature
I'm becoming! &hellip; to have such thoughts when Mother is sick
and I ought to be thinking only of her! &hellip; and it's none of
my damn business, anyway! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>glaring at Evans resentfully as if he were to blame</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Look at him! &hellip; he'll never
suspect anything! &hellip; what a simple-simon! &hellip; he adored
Gordon as a newsboy does a champion pugilist! &hellip; and Nina
writes of Gordon as if he had been a demi-god! &hellip; when
actually he came from the commonest people! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He suddenly speaks to Evans with a really savage
satisfaction.</i>) Did I tell you I once looked up Gordon's family
in Beachampton? A truly deplorable lot! When I remembered Gordon
and looked at his father I had either to suspect a lover in the
wood pile or to believe in an Immaculate Conception &hellip; that
is, until I saw his mother! Then a stork became the only
conceivable explanation!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>who has only half-heard and hasn't understood, says
vaguely</i>) I never saw his folks. (<i>indicating the papers</i>)
I can make this all out all right.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>sarcastically</i>) I'm glad it's
understandable!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>blunderingly</i>) I'll give it to Nina--and I hope
your mother is feeling better tomorrow.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>piqued</i>) Oh, I'm going. Why didn't you tell me
if I was interrupting--your writing!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>immediately guilty</i>) Oh, come on, Charlie, don't
get peevish, you know I didn't mean--(<i>The bell rings. Evans
stammers in confusion, trying at a nonchalant air</i>) Hello! That
must be Ned. You remember Darrell. He's coming out for a little
visit. Excuse me. (<i>He blunders out of the door.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looking after him with anger mixed with alarmed
suspicion and surprise</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Darrell? &hellip; what's he doing here?
&hellip; have they been meeting? &hellip; perhaps he was the one
who performed the &hellip; no, his idea was she ought to have a
child &hellip; but if she came and begged him? &hellip; but why
should Nina beg not to have a baby? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>distractedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, I don't know! &hellip; it's all a
sordid mess! &hellip; I ought to be going home! &hellip; I don't
want to see Darrell! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He starts for the door--then struck by a sudden thought,
stops.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Wait &hellip; I could ask him about
Mother &hellip; yes &hellip; good idea &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He comes back to the middle of the room, front, and is
standing there when Darrell enters, followed by Evans. Darrell has
not changed in appearance except that his expression is graver and
more thoughtful. His manner is more convincingly authoritative,
more mature. He takes in Marsden from head to foot with one
comprehensive glance.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>awkwardly</i>) Ned, you remember Charlie Marsden?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>holding out his hand, urbanely polite</i>) How are
you, Doctor?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>shaking his hand--briefly</i>) Hello.</p>

<p>EVANS--I'll go up and tell Nina you're here, Ned. (<i>He goes,
casting a resentful glance at Marsden.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>awkwardly, as Darrell sits down in the chair at
center, goes over and stands by the table</i>) I was on the point
of leaving when you rang. Then I decided to stop and renew our
acquaintance. (<i>He stoops and picks up one sheet of paper, and
puts it back carefully on the table.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>watching him--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Neat &hellip; suspiciously neat
&hellip; he's an old maid who seduces himself in his novels
&hellip; so I suspect &hellip; I'd like a chance to study him more
closely.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a boor! &hellip; he might say
something! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>forcing a smile</i>) And I wanted to ask a favor of you, a
word of advice as to the best specialist, the very best, it would
be possible to consult--</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>sharply</i>) On what?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>almost na&iuml;vely</i>) My mother has a pain in
her stomach.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>amused--dryly</i>) Possibly she eats too much.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>as he bends and carefully picks another sheet from
the floor to place it as carefully on the table</i>) She doesn't
eat enough to keep a canary alive. It's a dull, constant pain, she
says. She's terribly worried. She's terrified by the idea of
cancer. But, of course, that's perfect rot, she's never been sick a
day in her life and--</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>sharply</i>) She's showing more intelligence about
her pain than you are.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>bending down for another sheet, his voice trembling
with terror</i>) I don't understand--quite. Do you mean to say you
think--?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>brutally</i>) It's possible. (<i>He has pulled out
his pen and a card and is writing. Thinking grimly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Explode a bomb under him, as I did once
before &hellip; only way to get him started doing anything.
&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>angrily</i>) But--that's nonsense!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with satisfaction--unruffledly</i>) People who are
afraid to face unpleasant possibilities until it's too late commit
more murders and suicides than--(<i>holds out card</i>) Doctor
Schultz is your man. Take her to see him--tomorrow!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>bursting out in anger and misery</i>) Damn it,
you're condemning her without--! (<i>He breaks down chokingly.</i>)
You've no damn right!--(<i>He bends down, trembling all over, to
pick up another piece of paper.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>genuinely astonished and contrite</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">And I thought he was so ingrown he
didn't care a damn about anyone! &hellip; his mother &hellip; now I
begin to see him &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He jumps from his chair and going to Marsden puts a hand on
his shoulder--kindly</i>) I beg your pardon, Marsden. I only wanted
to drive it in that all delay is dangerous. Your mother's pain may
be due to any number of harmless causes, but you owe it to her to
make sure. Here. (<i>He hands out the card.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>straightens up and takes it, his eyes grateful
now--humbly</i>) Thank you. I'll take her to see him tomorrow.
(<i>Evans comes in.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>to Marsden, blunderingly</i>) Say, Charlie, I don't
want to hurry you but Nina wants some things at the store before it
closes, and if you'd give me a lift--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>dully</i>) Of course. Come along. (<i>He shakes
hands with Darrell.</i>) Good night, Doctor--and thank you.</p>

<p>DARRELL--Good night. (<i>Marsden goes, followed by
Evans.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>turns in the doorway and says meaningly</i>) Nina'll
be right down. For Pete's sake, have a good heart-to-heart talk
with her, Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>frowning--impatiently</i>) Oh--all right! Run
along. (<i>Evans goes. Darrell remains standing near the table
looking after them, thinking about Marsden.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Queer fellow, Marsden &hellip; mother's
boy still &hellip; if she dies what will he do? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then dismissing Marsden with a shrug of his
shoulders</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, well, he can always escape life in
a new book.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He moves around the table examining its disorder critically,
then sits down in armchair--amused</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Evidences of authorship &hellip; Sam's
ads? &hellip; isn't making good, he said &hellip; was I wrong in
thinking he had stuff in him? &hellip; hope not &hellip; always
liked Sam, don't know why exactly &hellip; said Nina'd gotten into
a bad state again &hellip; what's happened to their marriage?
&hellip; I felt a bit sorry for myself at their wedding &hellip;
not that I'd ever fallen &hellip; but I did envy him in a way
&hellip; she always had strong physical attraction for me &hellip;
that time I kissed her &hellip; one reason I've steered clear since
&hellip; take no chances on emotional didos &hellip; need all my
mind on my work &hellip; got rid of even that slight suspicion
&hellip; I'd forgotten all about her &hellip; she's a strange girl
&hellip; interesting case &hellip; I should have kept in touch on
that account &hellip; hope she'll tell me about herself &hellip;
can't understand her not having child &hellip; it's so obviously
the sensible thing &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Probably why &hellip; to expect common
sense of people proves you're lacking in it yourself! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>enters silently. She has fixed herself up, put on her
best dress, arranged her hair, rouged, etc.--but it is principally
her mood that has changed her, making her appear a younger,
prettier person for the moment. Darrell immediately senses her
presence, and, looking up, gets to his feet with a smile of
affectionate admiration. She comes quickly over to him saying with
frank pleasure</i>) Hello, Ned. I'm certainly glad to see you
again--after all these years!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>as they shake hands--smiling</i>) Not as long as
all that, is it? (<i>thinking admiringly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Wonderful-looking as ever &hellip; Sam
is a lucky devil! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Strong hands like Gordon's &hellip;
take hold of you &hellip; not like Sam's &hellip; yielding fingers
that let you fall back into yourself &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>teasingly</i>) I ought to cut you dead after the shameful
way you've ignored us!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>a bit embarrassedly</i>) I've really meant to
write. (<i>his eyes examining her keenly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Been through a lot since I saw her
&hellip; face shows it &hellip; nervous tension pronounced &hellip;
hiding behind her smile &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>uneasy under his glance</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hate that professional look in his
eyes &hellip; watching symptoms &hellip; without seeing me
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with resentful mockery</i>) Well, what do you suspect is
wrong with the patient now, Doctor? (<i>She laughs nervously.</i>)
Sit down, Ned. I suppose you can't help your diagnosing stare.
(<i>She turns from him and sits down in the rocker at
center.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>quickly averting his eyes--sits down--jokingly</i>)
Same old unjust accusation! You were always reading diagnosis into
me, when what I was really thinking was what fine eyes you had, or
what a becoming gown, or--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>smiling</i>) Or what a becoming alibi you could cook
up! Oh, I know you! (<i>With a sudden change of mood she laughs
gaily and naturally.</i>) But you're forgiven--that is, if you can
explain why you've never been to see us.</p>

<p>DARRELL--Honestly, Nina, I've been so rushed with work I haven't
had a chance to go anywhere.</p>

<p>NINA--Or an inclination!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>smiling</i>) Well--maybe.</p>

<p>NINA--Do you like the Institute so much? (<i>He nods
gravely.</i>) Is it the big opportunity you wanted?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>simply</i>) I think it is.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a smile</i>) Well, you're the taking kind for
whom opportunities are made!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>smiling</i>) I hope so.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sighing</i>) I wish that could be said of more of
us--(<i>then quickly</i>)--meaning myself.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking with a certain satisfaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Meaning Sam &hellip; that doesn't look
hopeful for future wedded bliss! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>teasingly</i>) But I heard you were "taking an opportunity"
to go in for literature--collaborating with Marsden.</p>

<p>NINA--No, Charlie is only going to advise. He'd never deign to
appear as co-author. And besides, he never appreciated the real
Gordon. No one did except me.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking caustically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gordon myth strong as ever &hellip;
root of her trouble still &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>keenly inquisitive</i>) Sam certainly appreciated him,
didn't he?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>not remembering to hide her contempt</i>) Sam? Why,
he's the exact opposite in every way!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>caustically thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">These heroes die hard &hellip; but
perhaps she can write him out of her system.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>persuasively</i>) Well, you're going ahead with the
biography, aren't you? I think you ought to.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>dryly</i>) For my soul, Doctor? (<i>listlessly</i>) I
suppose I will. I don't know. I haven't much time. The duties of a
wife--(<i>teasingly</i>) By the way, if it isn't too rude to
inquire, aren't you getting yourself engaged to some fair lady or
other?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>smiling--but emphatically</i>) Not on your life!
Not until after I'm thirty-five, at least!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sarcastically</i>) Then you don't believe in taking
your own medicine? Why, Doctor! Think of how much good it would do
you!--(<i>excitedly with a hectic sarcasm</i>)--if you had a nice
girl to love--or was it learn to love?--and take care of--whose
character you could shape and whose life you could guide and make
what you pleased, in whose unselfish devotion you could find peace!
(<i>more and more bitterly sarcastic</i>) And you ought to have a
baby, Doctor! You will never know what life is, you'll never be
really happy until you've had a baby, Doctor--a fine, healthy baby!
(<i>She laughs a bitter, sneering laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>after a quick, keen glance, thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Good! &hellip; she's going to tell
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>meekly</i>) I recognize my arguments. Was I really wrong on
every point, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>harshly</i>) On every single point, Doctor!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>glancing at her keenly</i>) But how? You haven't
given the baby end of it a chance yet, have you?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>bitterly</i>) Oh, haven't I? (<i>then bursts out with
intense bitterness</i>) I'll have you know I'm not destined to bear
babies, Doctor!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>startledly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's that? &hellip; why not?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>again with a certain satisfaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Can she mean Sam? &hellip; that he
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>soothingly--but plainly disturbed</i>) Why don't you begin
at the beginning and tell me all about it? I feel responsible.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>fiercely</i>) You are! (<i>then wearily</i>) And
you're not. No one is. You didn't know. No one could know.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>in same tone</i>) Know what? (<i>thinking with the
same eagerness to believe something he hopes</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She must mean no one could know that
Sam wasn't &hellip; but I might have guessed it &hellip; from his
general weakness &hellip; poor unlucky devil &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then as she remains silent--urgingly</i>) Tell me. I want to
help you, Nina.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>pouched</i>) It's too late, Ned. (<i>then
suddenly</i>) I've just thought--Sam said he happened to run into
you. That isn't so, is it? He went to see you and told you how
worried he was about me and asked you out to see me, didn't he?
(<i>as Darrell nods</i>) Oh, I don't mind! It's even rather
touching. (<i>then mockingly</i>) Well, since you're out here
professionally, and my husband wants me to consult you, I might as
well give you the whole case history! (<i>wearily</i>) I warn you
it isn't pretty, Doctor! But then life doesn't seem to be pretty,
does it? And, after all, you aided and abetted God the Father in
making this mess. I hope it'll teach you not to be so cocksure in
future. (<i>more and more bitterly</i>) I must say you proceeded
very unscientifically, Doctor! (<i>then suddenly starts her story
in a dull monotonous tone recalling that of Evans' mother in the
previous Act</i>) When we went to visit Sam's mother I'd known for
two months that I was going to have a baby.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>startled--unable to hide a trace of
disappointment</i>) Oh, then you actually were? (<i>thinking
disappointedly and ashamed of himself for being
disappointed</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">All wrong, what I thought &hellip; she
was going to &hellip; then why didn't she? &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a strange happy intensity</i>) Oh, Ned, I loved
it more than I've ever loved anything in my life--even Gordon! I
loved it so it seemed at times that Gordon must be its real father,
that Gordon must have come to me in a dream while I was lying
asleep beside Sam! And I was happy! I almost loved Sam then! I felt
he was a good husband!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>instantly repelled--thinking with scornful
jealousy</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ha! &hellip; the hero again! &hellip;
comes to her bed! &hellip; puts horns on poor Sam! &hellip; becomes
the father of his child! &hellip; I'll be damned if hers isn't the
most idiotic obsession I ever &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>her voice suddenly becoming flat and lifeless</i>) And
then Sam's mother told me I couldn't have my baby. You see, Doctor,
Sam's great-grandfather was insane, and Sam's grandmother died in
an asylum, and Sam's father had lost his mind for years before he
died, and an aunt who is still alive is crazy. So of course I had
to agree it would be wrong--and I had an operation.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>who has listened with amazed horror--profoundly
shocked and stunned</i>) Good God! Are you crazy, Nina? I simply
can't believe! It would be too hellish! Poor Sam, of all people!
(<i>bewilderedly</i>) Nina! Are you absolutely sure?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>immediately defensive and mocking</i>) Absolutely,
Doctor! Why? Do you think it's I who am crazy? Sam looks so healthy
and sane, doesn't he? He fooled you completely, didn't he? You
thought he'd be an ideal husband for me! And poor Sam's fooling
himself too because he doesn't know anything about all this--so you
can't blame him, Doctor!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking in a real panic of horror--and a flood of
protective affection for her</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">God, this is too awful! &hellip; on top
of all the rest! &hellip; how did she ever stand it! &hellip;
she'll lose her mind too! &hellip; and it's my fault! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>getting up, comes to her and puts his hands on her
shoulders, standing behind her--tenderly</i>) Nina! I'm so damn
sorry! There's only one possible thing to do now. You'll have to
make Sam give you a divorce.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>bitterly</i>) Yes? Then what do you suppose would be
his finish? No, I've enough guilt in my memory now, thank you! I've
got to stick to Sam! (<i>then with a strange monotonous
insistence</i>) I've promised Sam's mother I'd make him happy! He's
unhappy now because he thinks he isn't able to give me a child. And
I'm unhappy because I've lost my child. So I must have another
baby--somehow--don't you think, Doctor?--to make us both happy?
(<i>She looks up at him pleadingly. For a moment they stare into
each other's eyes--then both turn away in guilty
confusion.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>bewilderedly thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That look in her eyes &hellip; what
does she want me to think? &hellip; why does she talk so much about
being happy? &hellip; am I happy? &hellip; I don't know &hellip;
what is happiness? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>confusedly</i>) Nina, I don't know what to think.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking strangely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That look in his eyes &hellip; what did
he mean? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with the same monotonous insistence</i>) You must know what
to think. I can't think it out myself any more. I need your
advice--your <i>scientific</i> advice this time, if you please,
Doctor. I've thought and thought about it. I've told myself it's
what I ought to do. Sam's own mother urged me to do it. It's
sensible and kind and just and good. I've told myself this a
thousand times and yet I can't quite convince something in me
that's afraid of something. I need the courage of someone who can
stand outside and reason it out as if Sam and I were no more than
guinea pigs. You've got to help me, Doctor! You've got to show me
what's the sane--the truly sane, you understand!--thing I must do
for Sam's sake, and my own.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking confusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What do I have to do? &hellip; this was
all my fault &hellip; I owe her something in return &hellip; I owe
Sam something &hellip; I owe them happiness! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>irritably</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Damn it, there's a humming in my ears!
&hellip; I've caught some fever &hellip; I swore to live coolly
&hellip; let me see.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in a cold, emotionless professional voice, his face like a
mask of a doctor</i>) A doctor must be in full possession of the
facts, if he is to advise. What is it precisely that Sam's wife has
thought so much of doing?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in the same insistent tone</i>) Of picking out a
healthy male about whom she cared nothing and having a child by him
that Sam would believe was his child, whose life would give him
confidence in his own living, who would be for him a living proof
that his wife loved him. (<i>confusedly, strangely and
purposefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">This doctor is
healthy.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>in his ultra-professional manner--like an automaton
of a doctor</i>) I see. But this needs a lot of thinking over. It
isn't easy to prescribe--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I have a friend who has a wife &hellip;
I was envious at his wedding &hellip; but what has that to do with
it? &hellip; damn it, my mind won't work! &hellip; it keeps running
away to her &hellip; it wants to mate with her mind &hellip; in the
interest of Science? &hellip; what damned rot I'm thinking!
&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking as before</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">This doctor is nothing to me but a
healthy male &hellip; when he was Ned he once kissed me &hellip;
but I cared nothing about him &hellip; so that's all right, isn't
it, Sam's Mother?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Let me see &hellip; I am in the
laboratory and they are guinea pigs &hellip; in fact, in the
interest of science, I can be for the purpose of this experiment, a
healthy guinea pig myself and still remain an observer &hellip; I
observe my pulse is high, for example, and that's obviously because
I am stricken with a recurrence of an old desire &hellip; desire is
a natural male reaction to the beauty of the female &hellip; her
husband is my friend &hellip; I have always tried to help him
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>coldly</i>) I've been considering what Sam's wife told me
and her reasoning is quite sound. The child can't be her
husband's.</p>

<p>NINA--Then you agree with Sam's mother? She said: "Being happy
is the nearest we can ever come to knowing what good is!"</p>

<p>DARRELL--I agree with her decidedly. Sam's wife should find a
healthy father for Sam's child at once. It is her sane duty to her
husband. (<i>worriedly thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Have I ever been happy? &hellip; I have
studied to cure the body's unhappiness &hellip; I have watched
happy smiles form on the lips of the dying &hellip; I have
experienced pleasure with a number of women I desired but never
loved &hellip; I have known a bit of honor and a trifle of
self-satisfaction &hellip; this talk of happiness seems to me
extraneous &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>beginning to adopt a timid, diffident, guilty
tone</i>) This will have to be hidden from Sam so he can never
know! Oh, Doctor, Sam's wife is afraid!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>sharply professional</i>) Nonsense! This is no time
for timidity! Happiness hates the timid! So does Science! Certainly
Sam's wife must conceal her action! To let Sam know would be
insanely cruel of her--and stupid, for then no one could be the
happier for her act! (<i>anxiously thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Am I right to advise this? &hellip;
yes, it is clearly the rational thing to do &hellip; but this
advice betrays my friend! &hellip; no, it saves him! &hellip; it
saves his wife &hellip; and if a third party should know a little
happiness &hellip; is he any poorer, am I any the less his friend
because I saved him? &hellip; no, my duty to him is plain &hellip;
and my duty as an experimental searcher after truth &hellip; to
observe these three guinea pigs, of which I am one &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking determinedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must have my baby! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>timidly--gets from her chair and half-turns toward
him--pleadingly</i>) You must give his wife courage, Doctor. You
must free her from her feeling of guilt.</p>

<p>DARRELL--There can only be guilt when one deliberately neglects
one's manifest duty to life. Anything else is rot! This woman's
duty is to save her husband and herself by begetting a healthy
child! (<i>thinking guiltily and instinctively moving away from
her</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I am healthy &hellip; but he is my
friend &hellip; there is such a thing as honor! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>determinedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must take my happiness! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>frightenedly--comes after him</i>) But she is ashamed. It's
adultery. It's wrong.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>moving away again--with a cold sneering laugh of
impatience</i>) Wrong! Would she rather see her husband wind up in
an asylum? Would she rather face the prospect of going to pot
mentally, morally, physically herself through year after year of
devilling herself and him? Really, Madame, if you can't throw
overboard all such irrelevant moral ideas, I'll have to give up
this case here and now! (<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Who is talking? &hellip; is he
suggesting me? &hellip; but you know very well I can't be the one,
Doctor! &hellip; why not, you're healthy and it's a friendly act
for all concerned &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking determinedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must have my baby! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Going further toward him--she can now touch him with her
hand.</i>) Please, Doctor, you must give her strength to do this
right thing that seems to her so right and then so wrong! (<i>She
puts out her hand and takes one of his.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Whose hand is this? &hellip; it burns
me &hellip; I kissed her once &hellip; her lips were cold &hellip;
now they would burn with happiness for me! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>taking his other hand and slowly pulling him around to
face her, although he does not look at her--pleadingly</i>) Now she
feels your strength. It gives her the courage to ask you, Doctor,
to suggest the father. She has changed, Doctor, since she became
Sam's wife. She can't bear the thought now of giving herself to any
man she could neither desire nor respect. So each time her thoughts
come to the man she must select they are afraid to go on! She needs
your courage to choose!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>as if listening to himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Sam is my friend &hellip; well, and
isn't she your friend? &hellip; her two hands are so warm! &hellip;
I must not even hint at my desire! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>judicially calm</i>) Well, the man must be someone who is
not unattractive to her physically, of course.</p>

<p>NINA--Ned always attracted her.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's that she said? &hellip; Ned?
&hellip; attracts? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in same tone</i>) And the man should have a mind that can
truly understand--a scientific mind superior to the moral scruples
that cause so much human blundering and unhappiness.</p>

<p>NINA--She always thought Ned had a superior mind.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Did she say Ned? &hellip; she thinks
Ned &hellip; ?</p>

<p>(<i>in same tone</i>) The man should like and admire her, he
should be her good friend and want to help her, but he should not
love her--although he might, without harm to anyone, desire
her.</p>

<p>NINA--Ned does not love her--but he used to like her and, I
think, desire her. Does he now, Doctor?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Does he? &hellip; who is he? &hellip;
he is Ned! &hellip; Ned is I! &hellip; I desire her! &hellip; I
desire happiness! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>tremblingly now--gently</i>) But, Madame, I must confess the
Ned you are speaking of is I, and I am Ned.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>gently</i>) And I am Nina, who wants her baby.
(<i>Then she reaches out and turns his head until his face faces
hers but he keeps his eyes down--she bends her head meekly and
submissively--softly</i>) I should be so grateful, Ned. (<i>He
starts, looks up at her wildly, makes a motion as though to take
her in his arms, then remains fixed for a moment in that attitude,
staring at her bowed head as she repeats submissively</i>) I should
be so humbly grateful.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>suddenly falling on his knees and taking her hand
in both of his and kissing it humbly--with a sob</i>) Yes--yes,
Nina--yes--for your happiness--in that spirit!
(<i>thinking--fiercely triumphant</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I shall be happy for a while!
&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>raising her head--thinking--proudly
triumphant</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I shall be happy! &hellip; I shall make
my husband happy! &hellip;</p>

<h1><a name="a05" id="a05">ACT FIVE</a>
</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>The sitting room of a small house Evans has rented in
a seashore suburb near New York. It is a bright morning in the
following April.</i></p>

<p><i>The room is a typical sitting room of the quantity-production
bungalow type. Windows on the left look out on a broad porch. A
double doorway in rear leads into the hall. A door on right, to the
dining room. Nina has tried to take the curse of offensive, banal
newness off the room with some of her own things from her old home
but the attempt has been half-hearted in the face of such
overpowering commonness, and the result is a room as disorganized
in character as was the Professor's study in the last Act.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The arrangement of the furniture follows the same pattern as
in preceding scenes. There is a Morris chair and a round golden oak
table at left of center, an upholstered chair, covered with bright
chintz at center, a sofa covered with the same chintz at right.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Nina is sitting in the chair at center. She has been trying
to read a book but has let this drop listlessly on her lap. A great
change is noticeable in her face and bearing. She is again the
pregnant woman of Act Three but this time there is a triumphant
strength about her expression, a ruthless self-confidence in her
eyes. She has grown stouter, her face has filled out. One gets no
impression of neurotic strain from her now, she seems nerveless and
deeply calm.</i>
</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>as if listening for something within
her--joyfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There! &hellip; that can't be my
imagination &hellip; I felt it plainly &hellip; life &hellip; my
baby &hellip; my only baby &hellip; the other never really lived
&hellip; this is the child of my love! &hellip; I love Ned!
&hellip; I've loved him ever since that first afternoon &hellip;
when I went to him &hellip; so scientifically! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She laughs at herself.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, what a goose I was! &hellip; then
love came to me &hellip; in his arms &hellip; happiness! &hellip; I
hid it from him &hellip; I saw he was frightened &hellip; his own
joy frightened him &hellip; I could feel him fighting with himself
&hellip; during all those afternoons &hellip; our wonderful
afternoons of happiness! &hellip; and I said nothing &hellip; I
made myself be calculating &hellip; so when he finally said
&hellip; dreadfully disturbed &hellip; "Look here, Nina, we've done
all that is necessary, playing with fire is dangerous" &hellip; I
said, "You're quite right, Ned, of all things I don't want to fall
in love with you!" &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She laughs.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He didn't like that! &hellip; he looked
angry &hellip; and afraid &hellip; then for weeks he never even
phoned &hellip; I waited &hellip; it was prudent to wait &hellip;
but every day I grew more terrified &hellip; then just as my will
was breaking, his broke &hellip; he suddenly appeared again
&hellip; but I held him to his aloof doctor's pose and sent him
away, proud of his will power &hellip; and sick of himself with
desire for me! &hellip; every week since then he's been coming out
here &hellip; as my doctor &hellip; we've talked about our child
wisely, dispassionately &hellip; as if it were Sam's child &hellip;
we've never given in to our desire &hellip; and I've watched love
grow in him until I'm sure &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with sudden alarm</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But am I? &hellip; he's never once
mentioned love &hellip; perhaps I've been a fool to play the part
I've played &hellip; it may have turned him against me &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>suddenly with calm confidence</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No &hellip; he does &hellip; I feel it
&hellip; it's only when I start thinking, I begin to doubt
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She settles back and stares dreamily before her--a
pause.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There &hellip; again &hellip; his
child! &hellip; my child moving in my life &hellip; my life moving
in my child &hellip; the world is whole and perfect &hellip; all
things are each other's &hellip; life is &hellip; and the is is
beyond reason &hellip; questions die in the silence of this peace
&hellip; I am living a dream within the great dream of the tide
&hellip; breathing in the tide I dream and breathe back my dream
into the tide &hellip; suspended in the movement of the tide, I
feel life move in me, suspended in me &hellip; no whys matter
&hellip; there is no why &hellip; I am a mother &hellip; God is a
Mother &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She sighs happily, closing her eyes. A pause.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>enters from the hallway in rear. He is dressed
carefully but his clothes are old ones--shabby collegiate
gentility--and he has forgotten to shave. His eyes look pitiably
harried, his manner has become a distressingly obvious attempt to
cover up a chronic state of nervous panic and guilty conscience. He
stops inside the doorway and looks at her with a pitiable
furtiveness, arguing with himself, trying to get up his
courage.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Tell her! &hellip; go on! &hellip; you
made up your mind to, didn't you? &hellip; don't quit now! &hellip;
tell her you've decided &hellip; for her sake &hellip; to face the
truth &hellip; that she can't love you &hellip; she's tried
&hellip; she's acted like a good sport &hellip; but she's beginning
to hate you &hellip; and you can't blame her &hellip; she wanted
children &hellip; and you haven't been able &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>protesting feebly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I don't know for certain &hellip;
that that's my fault &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Aw, don't kid yourself, if she'd
married someone else &hellip; if Gordon had lived and married her
&hellip; I'll bet in the first month she'd &hellip; you'd better
resign from the whole game &hellip; with a gun! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He swallows hard as if he were choking back a sob--then
savagely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Stop whining! &hellip; go on and wake
her up! &hellip; say you're willing to give her a divorce so she
can marry some real guy who can give her what she ought to have!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with sudden terror</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">And if she says yes? &hellip; I
couldn't bear it! &hellip; I'd die without her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with a somber alien forcefulness</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">All right &hellip; good riddance!
&hellip; I'd have the guts to bump off then, all right! &hellip;
that'd set her free &hellip; come on now! &hellip; ask her!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>But his voice begins to tremble uncertainly again as he
calls</i>) Nina.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>opens her eyes and gazes calmly, indifferently at
him</i>) Yes?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>immediately terrified and beaten--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I can't! &hellip; the way she looks at
me! &hellip; she'd say yes! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>stammering</i>) I hate to wake you up but--it's about time
for Ned to come, isn't it?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>calmly</i>) I wasn't asleep. (<i>thinking as if she
found it hard to concentrate on him, to realize his
existence</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">This man is my husband &hellip; it's
hard to remember that &hellip; people will say he's the father of
my child.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with revulsion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That's shameful! &hellip; and yet
that's exactly what I wanted! &hellip; wanted! &hellip; not now!
&hellip; now I love Ned! &hellip; I won't lose him! &hellip; Sam
must give me a divorce &hellip; I've sacrificed enough of my life
&hellip; what has he given me? &hellip; not even a home &hellip; I
had to sell my father's home to get money so we could move near his
job &hellip; and then he lost his job! &hellip; now he's depending
on Ned to help him get another! &hellip; my love! &hellip; how
shameless! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then contritely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, I'm unjust &hellip; poor Sam
doesn't know about Ned &hellip; and it was I who wanted to sell the
place &hellip; I was lonely there &hellip; I wanted to be near
Ned.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>thinking in agony</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's she thinking? &hellip; probably
lucky for me I don't know! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>forcing a brisk air as he turns away from her</i>) I hope
Ned brings that letter he promised me to the manager of the Globe
company. I'm keen to get on the job again.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with scornful pity</i>) Oh, I guess Ned will bring the
letter. I asked him not to forget.</p>

<p>EVANS--I hope they'll have an opening right off. We can use the
money. (<i>hanging his head</i>) I feel rotten, living on you when
you've got so little.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>indifferently but with authority, like a governess to
a small boy</i>) Now, now!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>relieved</i>) Well, it's true. (<i>then coming to
her--humbly ingratiating</i>) You've felt a lot better lately,
haven't you, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a start--sharply</i>) Why?</p>

<p>EVANS--You look ever so much better. You're getting fat. (<i>He
forces a grin.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>curtly</i>) Don't be absurd, please! As a matter of
fact, I don't feel a bit better.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>thinking despondently</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Lately, she jumps on me every chance
she gets &hellip; as if everything I did disgusted her!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He strays over to the window and looks out listlessly.</i>)
I thought we'd get some word from Charlie this morning saying if he
was coming down or not. But I suppose he's still too broken up over
his mother's death to write.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>indifferently</i>) He'll probably come without
bothering to write. (<i>vaguely--wonderingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Charlie &hellip; dear old Charlie
&hellip; I've forgotten him, too.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--I think that's Ned's car now. Yes. It's stopping. I'll go
out and meet him. (<i>He starts for the door in rear.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sharply, before she can restrain the impulse</i>)
Don't be such a fool!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>stops--stammers confusedly</i>) What--what's the
matter?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>controlling herself--but irritably</i>) Don't mind me.
I'm nervous. (<i>thinking guiltily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">One minute I feel ashamed of him for
making such a fool of himself over my lover &hellip; the next
minute something hateful urges me to drive him into doing it!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>The maid has answered the ring and opened the outer door.
Ned Darrell comes in from the rear. His face looks older. There is
an expression of defensive bitterness and self-resentment about his
mouth and eyes. This vanishes into one of desire and joy as he sees
Nina. He starts toward her impulsively.</i> "Nina!" <i>then stops
short as he sees Evans</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>forgetting Evans, gets to her feet as if to receive
Darrell in her arms--with love</i>) Ned!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>affectionately and gratefully</i>) Hello, Ned! (<i>He
holds out his hand which Darrell takes mechanically.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>trying to overcome his guilty embarrassment</i>)
Hello, Sam. Didn't see you. (<i>hurriedly reaching in his coat</i>
<i>pocket</i>) Before I forget, here's that letter. I had a talk
over the phone with Appleby yesterday. He's pretty sure there's an
opening--(<i>with a condescension he can't help</i>)--but you'll
have to get your nose on the grindstone to make good with him.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>flushing guiltily--forcing a confident tone</i>) You
bet I will! (<i>then gratefully and humbly</i>) Gosh, Ned, I can't
tell you how grateful I am!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>brusquely, to hide his embarrassment</i>) Oh, shut
up! I'm only too glad.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>watching Evans with a contempt that is almost
gloating--in a tone of curt dismissal</i>) You'd better go and
shave, hadn't you, if you're going to town?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>guiltily, passing his hand over his face--forcing a
brisk, purposeful air</i>) Yes, of course. I forgot I hadn't.
Excuse me, will you? (<i>This to Darrell. Evans hurries out,
rear.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>as soon as he is out of earshot--turning on Nina
accusingly</i>) How can you treat him that way? It makes me
feel--like a swine!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>flushing guiltily--protestingly</i>) What way?
(<i>then inconsequentially</i>) He's always forgetting to shave
lately.</p>

<p>DARRELL--You know what I mean, Nina! (<i>turns away from
her--thinking bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a rotten liar I've become!
&hellip; and he trusts me absolutely! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why doesn't he take me in his arms?
&hellip; oh, I feel he doesn't love me now! &hellip; he's so
bitter! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>trying to be matter-of-fact</i>) I'm sorry, Ned. I don't
mean to be cross but Sam does get on my nerves.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Sometimes I almost hate her! &hellip;
if it wasn't for her I'd have kept my peace of mind &hellip; no
good for anything lately, damn it! &hellip; but it's idiotic to
feel guilty &hellip; if Sam only didn't trust me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then impatiently</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Bosh! &hellip; sentimental nonsense!
&hellip; end justifies means! &hellip; this will have a good end
for Sam, I swear to that! &hellip; why doesn't she tell him she's
pregnant? &hellip; what's she waiting for? &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking passionately, looking at him</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, my lover, why don't you kiss me?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>imploringly</i>) Ned! Don't be cross with me, please!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>fighting to control himself--coldly</i>) I'm not
cross, Nina. Only you must admit these triangular scenes are, to
say the least, humiliating. (<i>resentfully</i>) I won't come out
here again!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a cry of pain</i>) Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking exultingly at first</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She loves me! &hellip; she's forgotten
Gordon! &hellip; I'm happy! &hellip; do I love her? &hellip; no!
&hellip; I won't! &hellip; I can't! &hellip; think what it would
mean to Sam! &hellip; to my career! &hellip; be objective about it!
&hellip; you guinea pig! &hellip; I'm her doctor &hellip; and Sam's
&hellip; I prescribed child for them &hellip; that's all there is
to it! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>torn between hope and fear</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What is he thinking? &hellip; he's
fighting his love &hellip; oh, my lover! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>again with longing</i>) Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>putting on his best professional air, going to
her</i>) How do you feel today? You look as if you might have a
little fever. (<i>He takes her hand as if to feel her pulse. Her
hand closes over his. She looks up into his face. He keeps his
turned away.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>straining up toward him--with intense
longing--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I love you! &hellip; take me! &hellip;
what do I care for anything in the world but you! &hellip; let Sam
die! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>fighting himself--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Christ! &hellip; touch of her skin!
&hellip; her nakedness! &hellip; those afternoons in her arms!
happiness! &hellip; what do I care for anything else? &hellip; to
hell with Sam! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>breaking out passionately</i>) Ned! I love you! I
can't hide it any more! I won't! I love you, Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>suddenly taking her in his arms and kissing her
frantically</i>) Nina! Beautiful!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>triumphantly--between kisses</i>) You love me, don't
you? Say you do, Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>passionately</i>) Yes! Yes!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a cry of triumph</i>) Thank God! At last you've
told me! You've confessed it to yourself! Oh, Ned, you've made me
so happy! (<i>There is a ring from the front door bell. Darrell
hears it. It acts like an electric shock on him. He tears himself
away from her. Instinctively she gets up too and moves to the
lounge at right.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>stupidly</i>) Someone--at the door. (<i>He sinks
down in the chair by the table at left. Thinking
torturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I said I loved her! &hellip; she won!
&hellip; she used my desire! &hellip; but I don't love her!
&hellip; I won't! &hellip; she can't own my life! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>violently--almost shouts at her</i>) I don't, Nina! I tell
you I don't!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>The maid has just gone to the front door.</i>) Sshh!
(<i>then in a triumphant whisper</i>) You do, Ned! You do!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with dogged stupidity</i>) I don't! (<i>The front
door has been opened. Marsden appears in the rear, walks slowly and
woodenly like a man in a trance into the room. He is dressed
immaculately in deep mourning. His face is pale, drawn, haggard
with loneliness and grief. His eyes have a dazed look as if he were
still too stunned to comprehend clearly what has happened to him.
He does not seem conscious of Darrell's presence at first. His
shoulders are bowed, his whole figure droops.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--in a strange superstitious panic</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Black &hellip; in the midst of
happiness &hellip; black comes &hellip; again &hellip; death
&hellip; my father &hellip; comes between me and happiness!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then recovering herself, scornfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">You silly coward! &hellip; it's only
Charlie! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with furious resentment</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The old fool! &hellip; what does he
mean coming in on us without warning? &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>forcing a pitiful smile to his lips</i>) Hello,
Nina. I know it's an imposition--but--I've been in such a terrible
state since Mother--(<i>He falters, his face becomes distorted into
an ugly mask of grief, his eyes water.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>immediately sympathetic, gets up and goes to him
impulsively</i>) There's no question of imposition, Charlie. We
were expecting you. (<i>She has come to him and put her arms around
him. He gives way and sobs, his head against her shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>brokenly</i>) You don't know, Nina--how
terrible--it's terrible!--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>leading him to the chair at center, soothingly</i>) I
know, Charlie. (<i>thinking with helpless annoyance</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, dear, what can I say? &hellip; his
mother hated me &hellip; I'm not glad she's dead &hellip; but
neither am I sorry &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a trace of contempt</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor Charlie &hellip; he was so tied to
her apron strings &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then kindly but condescendingly, comforting him</i>) Poor
old Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>The words and the tone shock his pride to life. He
raises his head and half-pushes her away--resentfully,
thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor old Charlie! &hellip; damn it,
what am I to her? &hellip; her old dog who's lost his mother?
&hellip; Mother hated her &hellip; no, poor dear Mother was so
sweet, she never hated anyone &hellip; she simply disapproved
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>coldly</i>) I'm all right, Nina. Quite all right now, thank
you. I apologize for making a scene.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>has gotten up from his chair--with
relief--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Thank God for Marsden &hellip; I feel
sane again &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He comes to Marsden--cordially</i>) How are you, Marsden?
(<i>then offering conventional consolation, pats Marsden's
shoulder</i>) I'm sorry, Marsden.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>startled, looks up at him in amazement</i>)
Darrell! (<i>then with instant hostility</i>) There's nothing to be
sorry about that I can discover! (<i>Then as they both look at him
in surprise he realizes what he has said--stammeringly</i>) I
mean--sorry--is hardly the right word--hardly--is it?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>worriedly</i>) Sit down, Charlie. You look so tired.
(<i>He slumps down in the chair at center mechanically. Nina, and
Darrell return to their chairs. Nina looks across him at
Darrell--triumphantly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">You do love me, Ned! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking--answering her look--defiantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I don't love you! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>stares intensely before him. Thinking
suspiciously--morbidly agitated</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Darrell! &hellip; and Nina! &hellip;
there's something in this room! &hellip; something disgusting!
&hellip; like a brutal, hairy hand, raw and red, at my throat!
&hellip; stench of human life! &hellip; heavy and rank! &hellip;
outside it's April &hellip; green buds on the slim trees &hellip;
the sadness of spring &hellip; my loss at peace in Nature &hellip;
her sorrow of birth consoling my sorrow of death &hellip; something
human and unnatural in this room! &hellip; love and hate and
passion and possession! &hellip; cruelly indifferent to my loss!
&hellip; mocking my loneliness! &hellip; no longer any love for me
in any room! &hellip; lust in this room! &hellip; lust with a
loathsome jeer taunting my sensitive timidities! &hellip; my
purity! &hellip; purity? &hellip; ha! yes, if you say prurient
purity! &hellip; lust ogling me for a dollar with oily shoe button
Italian eyes! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in terror</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What thoughts! &hellip; what a low
scoundrel you are! &hellip; and your mother dead only two weeks!
&hellip; I hate Nina! &hellip; that Darrell in this room! &hellip;
I feel their desires! &hellip; where is Sam? &hellip; I'll tell
him! &hellip; no, he wouldn't believe &hellip; he's such a trusting
fool &hellip; I must punish her some other way &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>remorsefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What? &hellip; punish Nina? &hellip; my
little Nina? &hellip; why, I want her to be happy! &hellip; even
with Darrell? &hellip; it's all so confused! &hellip; I must stop
thinking! &hellip; I must talk! &hellip; forget! &hellip; say
something! &hellip; forget everything! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He suddenly bursts into a flood of garrulity.</i>) Mother
asked for you, Nina--three days before the end. She said, "Where is
Nina Leeds now, Charlie? When is she going to marry Gordon Shaw?"
Her mind was wandering, poor woman! You remember how fond she
always was of Gordon. She used to love to watch the football games
when he was playing. He was so handsome and graceful, she always
thought. She always loved a strong, healthy body. She took such
strict care of her own, she walked miles every day, she loved
bathing and boating in the summer even after she was sixty, she was
never sick a day in her life until--(<i>He turns on
Darrell--coldly</i>) You were right, Doctor Darrell. It was cancer.
(<i>then angrily</i>) But the doctor you sent me to, and the others
he called in could do nothing for her--absolutely nothing! I might
just as well have imported some witch doctors from the Solomon
Islands! They at least would have diverted her in her last hours
with their singing and dancing, but your specialists were a total
loss! (<i>suddenly with an insulting, ugly sneer, raising his
voice</i>) I think you doctors are a pack of God-damned ignorant
liars and hypocrites!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sharply</i>) Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>coming to himself--with a groan--shamefacedly</i>)
Don't mind me. I'm not myself, Nina. I've been through hell! (<i>He
seems about to sob--then abruptly springs to his feet, wildly</i>)
It's this room! I can't stand this room! There's something
repulsive about it!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>soothingly</i>) I know it's ugly, Charlie. I haven't
had a chance to fix it up yet. We've been too broke.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>confusedly</i>) Oh, it's all right. I'm ugly, too!
Where's Sam?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>eagerly</i>) Right upstairs. Go on up. He'll be
delighted to see you.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>vaguely</i>) Very well. (<i>He goes to the door,
then stops mournfully.</i>) But from what I saw on that visit to
his home, he doesn't love his mother much. I don't think he'll
understand, Nina. He never writes to her, does he?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>uneasily</i>) No--I don't know.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--She seemed lonely. He'll be sorry for it some day after
she--(<i>He gulps.</i>) Well--(<i>He goes.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in a sudden panic--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Sam's mother! &hellip; "Make my boy,
Sammy, happy!" &hellip; I promised &hellip; oh, why did Charlie
have to remember her? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then resolutely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I can't remember her now! &hellip; I
won't! &hellip; I've got to be happy! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>uneasily trying to force a casual conversation</i>)
Poor Marsden is completely knocked off balance, isn't he? (<i>a
pause</i>) My mother died when I was away at school. I hadn't seen
her in some time, so her death was never very real to me; but in
Marsden's case--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a possessive smile of tolerance</i>) Never mind
Charlie, Ned. What do I care about Charlie? I love you! And you
love me!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>apprehensively, forcing a tone of annoyed
rebuke</i>) But I don't! And you don't! You're simply letting your
romantic imagination run away with you--(<i>showing his jealous
resentment in spite of himself</i>)--as you did once before with
Gordon Shaw!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He is jealous of Gordon! &hellip; how
wonderful that is! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with provoking calm</i>) I loved Gordon.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>irritably ignoring this as if he didn't want to
hear it</i>) Romantic imagination! It has ruined more lives than
all the diseases! Other diseases, I should say! It's a form of
insanity! (<i>He gets up forcefully and begins to pace about the
room. Thinking uneasily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Mustn't look at her &hellip; find an
excuse and get away &hellip; and this time never come back!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>avoiding looking at her, trying to argue
reasonably--coldly</i>) You're acting foolishly, Nina--and very
unfairly. The agreement we made has no more to do with love than a
contract for building a house. In fact, you know we agreed it was
essential that love mustn't enter into it. And it hasn't in spite
of what you say. (<i>A pause. He walks about. She watches him.
Thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's got to come back to earth!
&hellip; I've got to break with her! &hellip; bad enough now!
&hellip; but to go on with it! &hellip; what a mess it'd make of
all our lives! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking tenderly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Let his pride put all the blame on me!
&hellip; I'll accept it gladly! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>irritably</i>) Of course, I realize I've been to
blame, too. I haven't been able to be as impersonal as I thought I
could be. The trouble is there's been a dangerous physical
attraction. Since I first met you, I've always desired you
physically. I admit that now.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>smiling tenderly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, he admits that, does he? &hellip;
poor darling! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>enticingly</i>) And you still do desire me, don't you,
Ned?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>keeping his back turned to her--roughly</i>) No!
That part of it is finished! (<i>Nina laughs softly, possessively.
He whirls around to face her--angrily</i>) Look here! You're going
to have the child you wanted, aren't you?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>implacably</i>) My child wants its father!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>coming a little toward her--desperately</i>) But
you're crazy! You're forgetting Sam! It may be stupid but I've got
a guilty conscience! I'm beginning to think we've wronged the very
one we were trying to help!</p>

<p>NINA--You were trying to help me, too, Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>stammering</i>) Well--all right--let's say that
part of it was all right then. But it's got to stop! It can't go
on!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>implacably</i>) Only your love can make me happy now!
Sam must give me a divorce so I can marry you.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking suspiciously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Look out! &hellip; there it is!
&hellip; marry! &hellip; own me! &hellip; ruin my career!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>scornfully</i>) Marry? Do you think I'm a fool? Get that out
of your head quick! I wouldn't marry anyone--no matter what! (<i>as
she continues to look at him with unmoved
determination--pleadingly</i>) Be sensible, for God's sake! We're
absolutely unsuited to each other! I don't admire your character! I
don't respect you! I know too much about your past! (<i>then
indignantly</i>) And how about Sam? Divorce him? Have you forgotten
all his mother told you? Do you mean to say you'd deliberately--?
And you expect me to--? What do you think I am?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>inflexibly</i>) You're my lover! Nothing else matters.
Yes, I remember what Sam's mother said. She said, "being happy is
the nearest we can come to knowing what good is." And I'm going to
be happy! I've lost everything in life so far because I didn't have
the courage to take it--and I've hurt everyone around me. There's
no use trying to think of others. One human being can't think of
another. It's impossible. (<i>gently and caressingly</i>) But this
time I'm going to think of my own happiness--and that means
you--and our child! That's quite enough for one human being to
think of, dear, isn't it? (<i>She reaches out and takes his hand. A
pause. With her other hand she gently pulls him around until he is
forced to look into her eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking fascinatedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I see my happiness in her eyes &hellip;
the touch of her soft skin! &hellip; those afternoons! &hellip;
God, I was happy! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in a strange dazed voice--as if it were forced out of him by
an impulse stronger than his will</i>) Yes, Nina.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in a determined voice</i>) I've given Sam enough of my
life! And it hasn't made him happy, not the least bit! So what's
the good? And how can we really know that his thinking our child
was his would do him any good? We can't! It's all guesswork. The
only thing sure is that we love each other.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>dazedly</i>) Yes. (<i>A noise from the hall and
Evans comes in from the rear. He sees their two hands together but
mistakes their meaning.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>genially--with a forced self-confident air</i>) Well,
Doc, how's the patient? I think she's much better, don't
you--although she won't admit it.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>at the first sound of Evans' voice, pulls his hand
from Nina's as if it were a hot coal--avoiding Evans' eyes, moving
away from her jerkily and self-consciously</i>) Yes. Much
better.</p>

<p>EVANS--Good! (<i>He pats Nina on the back. She shrinks away. His
confidence vanishes in a flash. Thinking miserably</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why does she shrink away &hellip; if I
even touch her? &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>matter-of-factly</i>) I must see how lunch is coming
on. You'll stay, of course, Ned?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>struggling--shakenly</i>) No, I think I'd
better--(<i>thinking desperately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Got to go! &hellip; can't go! &hellip;
got to go! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--Oh, come on, old man!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He must stay &hellip; and after lunch
we'll tell Sam.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with certainty</i>) He'll stay. (<i>meaningly</i>) And we
want to have a long talk with you after lunch, Sam--don't we, Ned?
(<i>Darrell does not answer. She goes out, right.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>vaguely making talk</i>) I got Charlie to lie down.
He's all in, poor guy. (<i>then trying to face Darrell who keeps
looking away from him</i>) What did Nina mean, you want a long talk
with me? Or is it a secret, Ned?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>controlling an impulse toward hysterical
laughter</i>) A secret? Yes, you bet it's a secret! (<i>He flings
himself in the chair at left, keeping his face averted. His
thoughts bitter and desperate like a cornered fugitive's</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">This is horrible! &hellip; Sam thinks
I'm finest fellow in world &hellip; and I do this to him! &hellip;
as if he hadn't enough! &hellip; born under a curse! &hellip; I
finish him! &hellip; a doctor! &hellip; God damn it! &hellip; I can
see his end! &hellip; never forgive myself! &hellip; never forget!
&hellip; break me! &hellip; ruin my career! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>more desperately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Got to stop this! &hellip; while
there's time! &hellip; she said &hellip; after lunch, talk &hellip;
she meant, tell him &hellip; that means kill him &hellip; then
she'll marry me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>beginning to be angry</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">By God, I won't! &hellip; she'll find
out! &hellip; smiling! &hellip; got me where she wants me! &hellip;
then be as cruel to me as she is to him! &hellip; love me? &hellip;
liar! &hellip; still loves Gordon! &hellip; her body is a trap!
&hellip; I'm caught in it! &hellip; she touches my hand, her eyes
get in mine, I lose my will! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>furiously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">By God, she can't make a fool of me
that way! &hellip; I'll go away some place! &hellip; go to Europe!
&hellip; study! &hellip; forget her in work! &hellip; keep hidden
until boat sails so she can't reach me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He is in a state of strange elation by this time.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Go now! &hellip; no! &hellip; got to
spike her guns with Sam! &hellip; by God, I see! &hellip; tell him
about baby! &hellip; that'll stop her! &hellip; when she knows I've
told him that, she'll see it's hopeless! &hellip; she'll stick to
him! &hellip; poor Nina! &hellip; I'm sorry! &hellip; she does love
me! &hellip; hell! &hellip; she'll forget! &hellip; she'll have her
child! &hellip; she'll be happy! &hellip; and Sam'll be happy!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He suddenly turns to Evans who has been staring at him,
puzzledly--in a whisper</i>) Look here, Sam. I can't stay to lunch.
I haven't time, I've got a million things to do. I'm sailing for
Europe in a few days.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>surprised</i>) You're sailing?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>very hurriedly</i>) Yes--going to study over there
for a year or so. I haven't told anyone. I came out today to say
good-bye. You won't be able to reach me again. I'll be out of town
visiting. (<i>then elatedly</i>) And now for your secret! It ought
to make you very happy, Sam. I know how much you've wished for it,
so I'm going to tell you although Nina'll be furious with me. She
was saving it to surprise you with at her own proper
time--(<i>still more elatedly</i>)--but I'm selfish enough to want
to see you happy before I go!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>not daring to believe what he hopes--stammering</i>)
What--what is it, Ned?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>clapping him on the back--with strange
joviality</i>) You're going to be a father, old scout, that's the
secret! (<i>Then as Evans just stares at him dumbly in a blissful
satisfaction, he rattles on.</i>) And now I've got to run. See you
again in a year or so. I've said good-bye to Nina. Good-bye, Sam.
(<i>He takes his hand and clasps it.</i>) Good luck! Buckle down to
work now! You've got the stuff in you! When I get back I'll expect
to hear you're on the highroad to success! And tell Nina I'll
expect to find you both happy in your child--both of you, tell
her!--happy in your child! Tell her that, Sam! (<i>He turns and
goes to the door. Thinking as he goes</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That does it! &hellip; honorably!
&hellip; I'm free! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He goes out--then out the front door--a moment later his
motor is heard starting--dies away.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>stares after him dumbly in the same state of happy
stupefaction--mumbles</i>) Thank you--Ned. (<i>thinking
disjointedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why did I doubt myself? &hellip; now
she loves me &hellip; she's loved me right along &hellip; I've been
a fool &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He suddenly falls on his knees.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, God, I thank you!</p>

<p>(<i>Nina comes in from the kitchen. She stops in amazement when
she sees him on his knees. He jumps to his feet and takes her in
his arms with confident happiness and kisses her.</i>) Oh, Nina, I
love you so! And now I know you love me! I'll never be afraid of
anything again!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>bewildered and terror-stricken, trying feebly to push
him away--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Has he &hellip; has he gone crazy?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>weakly</i>) Sam! What's come over you, Sam?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>tenderly</i>) Ned told me--the secret--and I'm so
happy, dear! (<i>He kisses her again.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>stammering</i>) Ned told you--what?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>tenderly</i>) That we're going to have a child, dear.
You mustn't be sore at him. Why did you want to keep it a secret
from me? Didn't you know how happy it would make me, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--He told you we--we--you, the father--? (<i>then suddenly
breaking from him--wildly</i>) Ned! Where is Ned?</p>

<p>EVANS--He left a moment ago.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>stupidly</i>) Left? Call him back. Lunch is ready.</p>

<p>EVANS--He's gone. He couldn't stay. He's got so much to do
getting ready to sail.</p>

<p>NINA--Sail?</p>

<p>EVANS--Didn't he tell you he was sailing for Europe? He's going
over for a year or so to study.</p>

<p>NINA--A year or so! (<i>wildly</i>) I've got to call him up! No,
I'll go in and see him right now! (<i>She takes a wavering step
toward the door. Thinking in anguish</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Go! &hellip; go to him! &hellip; find
him! &hellip; my lover! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--He won't be there, I'm afraid. He said we couldn't reach
him, that he'd be visiting friends out of town until he sailed.
(<i>solicitously</i>) Why, do you have to see him about something
important, Nina? Perhaps I could locate--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>stammering and swaying</i>) No. (<i>She stifles an
hysterical laugh.</i>) No, nothing--nothing important--nothing is
important--ha--! (<i>She stifles another laugh--then on the verge
of fainting, weakly</i>) Sam! Help me--</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>rushes to her, supports her to sofa at right</i>)
Poor darling! Lie down and rest. (<i>She remains in a sitting
position, staring blankly before her. He chafes her wrists.</i>)
Poor darling! (<i>thinking jubilantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Her condition &hellip; this weakness
comes from her condition! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking in anguish</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned doesn't love me! &hellip; he's
gone! &hellip; gone forever! &hellip; like Gordon! &hellip; no, not
like Gordon! &hellip; like a sneak, a coward! &hellip; a liar!
&hellip; oh, I hate him! &hellip; O Mother God, please let me hate
him! &hellip; he must have been planning this! &hellip; he must
have known it today when he said he loved me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>thinking frenziedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I won't bear it! &hellip;he thinks he
has palmed me off on Sam forever! &hellip; and his child! &hellip;
he can't! &hellip; I'll tell Sam he was lying! &hellip; I'll make
Sam hate him! &hellip; I'll make Sam kill him! &hellip; I'll
promise to love Sam if he kills him! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>suddenly turns to Evans--savagely</i>) He lied to you!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>letting her wrists drop--appalled--stammers</i>) You
mean--Ned lied about--?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in same tone</i>) Ned lied to you!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>stammers</i>) You're not--going to have a child--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>savagely</i>) Oh, yes! Oh, yes, I am! Nothing can keep
me from that! But you're--you're--I mean, you &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>thinking in anguish</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I can't say that to him! &hellip; I
can't tell him without Ned to help me! &hellip; I can't! &hellip;
look at his face! &hellip; oh, poor Sammy! &hellip; poor little
boy! &hellip; poor little boy! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She takes his head and presses it to her breast and begins
to weep. Weeping</i>) I mean, you weren't to know about it,
Sammy.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>immediately on the crest again--tenderly</i>) Why?
Don't you want me to be happy, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--Yes--yes, I do, Sammy. (<i>thinking strangely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Little boy! &hellip; little boy!
&hellip; one gives birth to little boys! &hellip; one doesn't drive
them mad and kill them! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's never called me Sammy before
&hellip; someone used to &hellip; oh, yes,
Mother.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>tenderly and boyishly</i>) And I'm going to make you happy
from now on, Nina. I tell you, the moment Ned told me, something
happened to me! I can't explain it, but--I'll make good now, Nina!
I know I've said that before but I was only boasting. I was only
trying to make myself think so. But now I say it knowing I can do
it! (<i>softly</i>) It's because we're going to have a child, Nina.
I knew that you'd never come to really love me without that. That's
what I was down on my knees for when you came in. I was thanking
God--for our baby!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>tremblingly</i>) Sammy! Poor boy!</p>

<p>EVANS--Ned said when he came back he'd expect to find us both
happy--in our baby. He said to tell you that. You will be happy
now, won't you, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>brokenly and exhaustedly</i>) I'll try to make you
happy, Sammy. (<i>He kisses her, then hides his head, on her
breast. She stares out over his head. She seems to grow older.
Thinking as if she were repeating the words of some inner voice of
life</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Not Ned's child! &hellip; not Sam's
child! &hellip; mine! &hellip; there! &hellip; again! &hellip; I
feel my child live &hellip; moving in my life &hellip; my life
moving in my child &hellip; breathing in the tide I dream and
breathe my dream back into the tide &hellip; God is a Mother.
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with sudden anguish</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, afternoons &hellip; dear wonderful
afternoons of love with you, my lover &hellip; you are lost
&hellip; gone from me forever! &hellip;</p>

<p align="center">(<i>Curtain</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a06" id="a06">SECOND PART</a>
</h1>

<h1>ACT SIX</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>The same--an evening a little over a year later. The
room has undergone a significant change. There is a comfortable,
homey atmosphere as though now it definitely belonged to the type
of person it was built for. It has a proud air of modest
prosperity.</i></p>

<p><i>It is soon after dinner--about eight o'clock. Evans is
sitting by the table at left, glancing through a newspaper at
headlines and reading an article here and there. Nina is in the
chair at center, knitting a tiny sweater. Marsden is sitting on the
sofa at right, holding a book which he pretends to be looking
through, but glancing wonderingly at Evans and Nina.</i>
</p>

<p><i>There is a startling change in Evans. He is stouter, the
haggard look of worry and self-conscious inferiority has gone from
his face, it is full and healthy and satisfied. There is also, what
is more remarkable, a decided look of solidity about him, of a
determination moving toward ends it is confident it can achieve. He
has matured, found his place in the world.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The change in Nina is also perceptible. She looks noticeably
older, the traces of former suffering are marked on her face, but
there is also an expression of present contentment and calm.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Marsden has aged greatly. His hair is gray, his expression
one of a deep grief that is dying out into a resignation resentful
of itself He is dressed immaculately in dark tweed.</i>
</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I wonder if there's a draft in the
baby's room? &hellip; maybe I'd better close the window? &hellip;
oh, I guess it's all right &hellip; he needs lots of fresh air
&hellip; little Gordon &hellip; he does remind me of Gordon
&hellip; something in his eyes &hellip; my romantic imagination?
&hellip; Ned said that &hellip; why hasn't Ned ever written?
&hellip; it's better he hasn't &hellip; how he made me suffer!
&hellip; but I forgive him &hellip; he gave me my baby &hellip; the
baby certainly doesn't look like him &hellip; everyone says he
looks like Sam &hellip; how absurd! &hellip; but Sam makes a
wonderful father &hellip; he's become a new man in the past year
&hellip; and I've helped him &hellip; he asks me about everything
&hellip; I have a genuine respect for him now &hellip; I can give
myself without repulsion &hellip; I am making him happy &hellip;
I've written his mother I'm making him happy &hellip; I was proud
to be able to write her that &hellip; how queerly things work out!
&hellip; all for the best &hellip; and I don't feel wicked &hellip;
I feel good &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She smiles strangely.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a change! &hellip; the last time I
was here the air was poisoned &hellip; Darrell &hellip; I was sure
he was her lover &hellip; but I was in a morbid state &hellip; why
did Darrell run away? &hellip; Nina could have got Sam to divorce
her if she really loved Darrell &hellip; then it's evident she
couldn't have loved him &hellip; and she was going to have Sam's
baby &hellip; Darrell's love must have seemed like treachery
&hellip; so she sent him away &hellip; that must be it &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with satisfaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Yes, I've got it straight now&hellip;
.</p>

<p>(<i>with contemptuous pity</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor Darrell &hellip; I have no use for
him but I did pity him when I ran across him in Munich &hellip; he
was going the pace &hellip; looked desperate &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then gloomily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">My running away was about as successful
as his &hellip; as if one could leave one's memory behind! &hellip;
I couldn't forget Mother &hellip; she haunted me through every city
of Europe &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then irritatedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must get back to work! &hellip; not a
line written in over a year! &hellip; my public will be forgetting
me! &hellip; a plot came to me yesterday &hellip; my mind is coming
around again &hellip; I am beginning to forget, thank God!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then remorsefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, I don't want to forget you, Mother!
&hellip; but let me remember &hellip; without pain! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>turning over a page of his paper</i>) There's going
to be the biggest boom before long this country has ever known, or
I miss my guess, Nina.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with great seriousness</i>) Do you think so,
Sammy?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>decidedly</i>) I'm dead sure of it.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a maternal pride and amusement</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Dear Sam &hellip; I can't quite believe
in this self-confident business man yet &hellip; but I have to
admit he's proved it &hellip; he asked for more money and they gave
it without question &hellip; they're anxious to keep him &hellip;
they ought to be &hellip; how he's slaved! &hellip; for me and my
baby! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>has been looking at Marsden surreptitiously over his
paper</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Charlie's mother must have hoarded up a
half million &hellip; he'll let it rot in government bonds &hellip;
wonder what he'd say if I proposed that he back me? &hellip; he's
always taken a friendly interest &hellip; well, it's worth a bet,
anyway &hellip; he'd be an easy partner to handle &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>staring at Evans wonderingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a changed Sam! &hellip; I
preferred him the old way &hellip; futile but he had a sensitive
quality &hellip; now he's brash &hellip; a little success &hellip;
oh, he'll succeed all right &hellip; his kind are inheriting the
earth &hellip; hogging it, cramming it down their tasteless
gullets! &hellip; and he's happy! &hellip; actually happy! &hellip;
he has Nina &hellip; a beautiful baby &hellip; a comfortable home
&hellip; no sorrow, no tragic memories &hellip; and I have nothing!
&hellip; but utter loneliness! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with grieving self-pity</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">If only Mother had lived! &hellip; how
horribly I miss her! &hellip; my lonely home &hellip; who will keep
house for me now? &hellip; it has got to be done sympathetically or
I won't be able to work &hellip; I must write to Jane &hellip;
she'll probably be only too glad &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>turning to Nina</i>) I think I'll write to my sister in
California and ask her to come on and live with me. She's alone now
that her youngest daughter is married, and she has very little
money. And my hands are tied as far as sharing the estate with her
is concerned. According to Mother's will, I'm cut off too if I give
her a penny. Mother never got over her bitter feeling about Jane's
marriage. In a way, she was right. Jane's husband wasn't much--no
family or position or ability--and I doubt if she was ever happy
with him. (<i>sarcastically</i>) It was one of those love
matches!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>smiling--teasingly</i>) There's no danger of your ever
making a love match, is there, Charlie?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>wincing--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She can't believe any woman could
possibly love me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>caustically</i>) I trust I'll never make that kind of a fool
of myself, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>teasingly</i>) Pooh! Aren't you the superior bachelor!
I don't see anything to be so proud of! You're simply shirking,
Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>wincing but forcing a teasing air</i>) You were my
only true love, Nina. I made a vow of perpetual bachelorhood when
you threw me over in Sam's favor!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>has listened to this last--jokingly</i>) Hello!
What's this? I never knew you were my hated rival, Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>dryly</i>) Oh--didn't you really? (<i>But Evans has
turned back to his paper. Thinking savagely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That fool, too! &hellip; he jokes about
it! &hellip; as if I were the last one in the world he could
imagine &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>teasingly</i>) Well, if I'm responsible, Charlie, I
feel I ought to do something about it. I'll pick out a wife for
you--guaranteed to suit! She must be at least ten years older than
you, large and matronly and placid, and a wonderful cook and
housekeeper--</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>sharply</i>) Don't be stupid! (<i>thinking
angrily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She picks someone beyond the age!
&hellip; she never imagines sex could enter into it! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>placatingly--seeing he is really angry</i>) Why, I was
only picking out a type I thought would be good for you,
Charlie--and for your work.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>sneeringly--with a meaning emphasis</i>) You didn't
mention chaste. I couldn't respect a woman who hadn't respected
herself!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--stung</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's thinking of those men in the
hospital &hellip; what a fool I was ever to tell him! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>cuttingly</i>) Oh, so you think you deserve an innocent
virgin!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>coldly--controlling his anger</i>) Let's drop me,
if you please. (<i>with a look at her that is challenging and
malicious</i>) Did I tell you I ran into Doctor Darrell in
Munich?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>startled--thinking frightenedly and
confusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned! &hellip; he saw Ned! &hellip; why
hasn't he told me before? &hellip; why did he look at me like that?
&hellip; does he suspect? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>trying to be calm but stammering</i>) You saw--Ned?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with savage satisfaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That struck home! &hellip; look at her!
&hellip; guilty! &hellip; then I was right that day! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>casually</i>) Yes, I chanced to run into him.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>more calmly now</i>) Why on earth didn't you tell us
before, Charlie?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>coolly</i>) Why? Is it such important news? You
knew he was there, didn't you? I supposed he'd written you.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>looking up from his paper--affectionately</i>) How
was the old scout?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>maliciously</i>) He seemed in fine feather--said he
was having a gay time. When I saw him he was with a startling
looking female--quite beautiful, if you like that type. I gathered
they were living together.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>cannot restrain herself--breaks out</i>) I don't
believe it! (<i>then immediately controlling herself and forcing a
laugh</i>) I mean, Ned was always so serious-minded it's hard to
imagine him messed up in that sort of thing. (<i>thinking in a
queer state of jealous confusion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Hard to imagine! &hellip; my lover!
&hellip; oh, pain again! &hellip; why? &hellip; I don't love him
now &hellip; be careful! &hellip; Charlie's staring at me&hellip;
.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking--jealously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Then she did love him! &hellip; does
she still? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>hopefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Or is it only pique? &hellip; no woman
likes to lose a man even when she no longer loves him. &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with malicious insistence</i>) Why is that hard to imagine,
Nina?</p>

<p>Darrell never struck me as a Galahad. After all, why shouldn't
he have a mistress? (<i>meaningly</i>) He has no tie over here to
remain faithful to, has he?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>struggling with herself--thinking pitiably</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's right &hellip; why shouldn't Ned?
&hellip; is that why he's never written? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>airily</i>) I don't know what ties he has or hasn't got.
It's nothing to me if he has fifty mistresses. I suppose he's no
better than the rest of you.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>looking over at her--tenderly reproachful</i>) That
isn't fair, Nina. (<i>thinking proudly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'm proud of that &hellip; never anyone
before her &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>looking at him--with real gratitude</i>) I didn't mean
you, dear. (<i>thinking--proudly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Thank God for Sammy! &hellip; I know
he's mine &hellip; no jealousy &hellip; no fear &hellip; no pain
&hellip; I've found peace &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then distractedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, Ned, why haven't you written?
&hellip; stop it! &hellip; what a fool I am! &hellip; Ned's dead
for me! &hellip; oh, I hate Charlie! &hellip; why did he tell me?
&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looking at Evans--contemptuously thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a poor simpleton Sam is! &hellip;
boasting of his virtue! &hellip; as if women loved you for that!
&hellip; they despise it! &hellip; I don't want Nina to think I've
had no experiences with women.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>mockingly</i>) So then it's Sam who is the Galahad, eh?
Really, Nina, you should have him put in the Museum among the
prehistoric mammals!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>pleased--comes back kiddingly</i>) Well, I never had
your chances, Charlie! I couldn't run over to Europe and get away
with murder the way you have!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>foolishly pleased--admitting while denying</i>) Oh,
I wasn't quite as bad as all that, Sam! (<i>scornfully ashamed of
himself--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor sick ass that I am! &hellip; I
want them to think I've been a Don Juan! &hellip; how pitiful and
disgusting! &hellip; I wouldn't have a mistress if I could!
&hellip; if I could? &hellip; of course I could! &hellip; I've
simply never cared to degrade myself! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--tormentedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The thought of that woman! &hellip; Ned
forgetting our afternoons in nights with her! &hellip; stop these
thoughts! &hellip; I won't give in to them! &hellip; why did
Charlie want to hurt me? &hellip; is he jealous of Ned? &hellip;
Charlie has always loved me in some queer way of his own &hellip;
how ridiculous! &hellip; look at him! &hellip; he's so proud of
being thought a Don Juan! &hellip; I'm sure he never even dared to
kiss a woman except his mother! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>mockingly</i>) Do tell us about all your various mistresses
in foreign parts, Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>in confusion now</i>) I--I really don't remember,
Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--Why, you're the most heartless person I've ever heard of,
Charlie! Not remember even one! And I suppose there are little
Marsdens--and you've forgotten all about them too! (<i>She laughs
maliciously--Evans laughs with her.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>still more confused--with a silly idiotic
smirk</i>) I can't say about that, Nina. It's a wise father who
knows his own child, you know!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>frightenedly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What does he mean? &hellip; does he
suspect about the baby too? &hellip; I must be terribly careful of
Charlie! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>looking up from his paper again</i>) Did Ned say
anything about coming back?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--longingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Come back? &hellip; oh, Ned, how I
wish! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looking at her--meaningly</i>) No, he didn't say. I
gathered he was staying over indefinitely.</p>

<p>EVANS--I'd sure like to see him again.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He has forgotten me &hellip; if he did
come, he'd probably avoid me.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--He spoke of you. He asked if I'd heard whether Nina had
had her baby yet or not. I told him I hadn't.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>heartily</i>) Too bad you didn't know. You could have
told him what a world-beater we've got! Eh, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>mechanically</i>) Yes. (<i>joyfully--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned asked about my baby! &hellip; then
he hadn't forgotten! &hellip; if he came back he'd come to see his
baby! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>solicitously</i>) Isn't it time to nurse him
again?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>starts to her feet automatically</i>) Yes, I'm going
now. (<i>She glances at Marsden, thinking calculatingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must win Charlie over again &hellip;
I don't feel safe &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She stops by his chair and takes his hand and looks into his
eyes gently and reproachfully.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking shamefacedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why have I been trying to hurt her?
&hellip; my Nina! &hellip; I am nearer to her than anyone! &hellip;
I'd give my life to make her happy! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>triumphantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How his hand trembles! &hellip; what a
fool to be afraid of Charlie! &hellip; I can always twist him round
my finger! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She runs her hand through his hair, and speaks as though she
were hiding a hurt reproach beneath a joking tone.</i>) I shouldn't
like you any more, do you know it, after you've practically
admitted you've philandered all over Europe! And I thought you were
absolutely true to me, Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>so pleased he can hardly believe his ears</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Then she did believe me! &hellip; she's
actually hurt! &hellip; but I can't let her think &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with passionate earnestness, clasping her hand in both of
his, looking into her eyes</i>) No, Nina! I swear to you!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--cruelly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Pah! &hellip; how limp his hands are!
&hellip; his eyes are so shrinking! &hellip; is it possible he
loves me? &hellip; like that? &hellip; what a sickening idea!
&hellip; it seems incestuous somehow! &hellip; no, it's too absurd!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>smiling, gently releases her hand</i>) All right. I forgive
you, Charlie. (<i>then matter-of-factly</i>) Excuse me, please,
while I go up and feed my infant, or we're due to hear some lusty
howling in a moment. (<i>She turns away, then impulsively turns
back and kisses Marsden with real affection.</i>) You're an old
dear, do you know it, Charlie? I don't know what I'd do without
you! (<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It's true, too! &hellip; he's my only
dependable friend &hellip; I must never lose him &hellip; never let
him suspect about little Gordon &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She turns to go.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>jumping up, throwing his paper aside</i>) Wait a
second. I'll come with you. I want to say good night to him.</p>

<p>(<i>He comes, puts his arm about her waist, kisses her and they
go</i> <i>out together.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking excitedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I almost confessed I loved her!
&hellip; a queer expression came over her face &hellip; what was
it? &hellip; was it satisfaction? &hellip; she didn't mind?
&hellip; was it pleasure? &hellip; then I can hope? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then miserably</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Hope for what? &hellip; what do I want?
&hellip; If Nina were free, what would I do? &hellip; would I do
anything? &hellip; would I wish to? &hellip; what would I offer
her? &hellip; money? &hellip; she could get that from others
&hellip; myself? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a prize! &hellip; my ugly body
&hellip; there's nothing in me to attract her &hellip; my fame?
&hellip; God, what a shoddy, pitiful! &hellip; but I might have
done something big &hellip; I might still &hellip; if I had the
courage to write the truth &hellip; but I was born afraid &hellip;
afraid of myself &hellip; I've given my talent to making fools feel
pleased with themselves in order that they'd feel pleased with me
&hellip; and like me &hellip; I'm neither hated nor loved &hellip;
I'm liked &hellip; women like me &hellip; Nina likes me!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She can't help letting the truth escape
her! &hellip; "You're an old dear, do you know it, Charlie?" Oh,
yes, I know it &hellip; too damned well! &hellip; dear old Charlie!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in anguish</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Dear old Rover, nice old doggie, we've
had him for years, he's so affectionate and faithful but he's
growing old, he's getting cross, we'll have to get rid of him soon!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in a strange rage, threateningly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But you won't get rid of me so easily,
Nina! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then confusedly and shamefacedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Good God, what's the matter with me!
&hellip; since Mother's death I've become a regular idiot!
&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>comes back from the right, a beaming look of proud
parenthood on his face</i>) He was sleeping so soundly an
earthquake wouldn't have made him peep! (<i>He goes back to his
chair--earnestly</i>) He sure is healthy and husky, Charlie. That
tickles me more than anything else. I'm going to start in training
him as soon as he's old enough--so he'll be a crack athlete when he
goes to college--what I wanted to be and couldn't. I want him to
justify the name of Gordon and be a bigger star than Gordon ever
was, if that's possible.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with a sort of pity--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">His is an adolescent mind &hellip;
he'll never grow up &hellip; well, in this adolescent country, what
greater blessing could he wish for? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>forcing a smile</i>) How about training his mind?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>confidently</i>) Oh, that'll take care of itself.
Gordon was always near the top in his studies, wasn't he? And with
Nina for a mother, his namesake ought to inherit a full set of
brains.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>amused</i>) You're the only genuinely modest person
I know, Sam.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>embarrassed</i>) Oh--me--I'm the boob of the family.
(<i>then hastily</i>) Except when it comes to business. I'll make
the money. (<i>confidently</i>) And you can bet your sweet life I
will make it!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--I'm quite sure of that.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>very seriously--in a confidential tone</i>) I
couldn't have said that two years ago--and believed it. I've
changed a hell of a lot! Since the baby was born, I've felt as if I
had a shot of dynamite in each arm. They can't pile on the work
fast enough. (<i>He grins--then seriously</i>) It was about time I
got hold of myself. I wasn't much for Nina to feel proud about
having around the house in those days. Now--well--at least I've
improved. I'm not afraid of my own shadow any more.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking strangely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Not to be afraid of one's shadow!
&hellip; that must be the highest happiness of heaven! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>flatteringly</i>) Yes, you've done wonders in the past
year.</p>

<p>EVANS--Oh, I haven't even started yet. Wait till I get my
chance! (<i>glances at Marsden sharply, makes up his mind and leans
forward toward him confidentially</i>) And I see my real chance,
Charlie--lying right ahead, waiting for me to grab it--an agency
that's been allowed to run down and go to seed. Within a year or so
they'll be willing to sell out cheap. One of their people who's
become a good pal of mine told me that in confidence, put it up to
me. He'd take it on himself but he's sick of the game. But I'm not!
I love it! It's great sport! (<i>then putting the brake on this
exuberance--matter-of- factly</i>) But I'll need a hundred
thousand--and where will I get it? (<i>looking at Marsden keenly
but putting on a joking tone</i>) Any suggestion you can make,
Charlie, will be gratefully received.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking suspiciously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Does he actually imagine I &hellip; ?
and a hundred thousand, no less! &hellip; over one-fifth of my
entire &hellip; by Jove, I'll have to throw cold water on that
fancy! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>shortly</i>) No, Sam, I can't think of anyone. Sorry.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>without losing any confidence--with a grin</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Check! &hellip; That's that! &hellip;
Charlie's out &hellip; till the next time! &hellip; but I'll keep
after him! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>contemplating himself with pride</i>)</p>

<p>Gee, I have changed all right! I can remember when a refusal
like that would have ruined my confidence for six months!</p>

<p>(<i>heartily</i>) Nothing to be sorry about, old man. I only
mentioned it on the off chance you might know of someone.
(<i>trying a bold closing stroke--jokingly</i>) Why don't you be my
partner, Charlie? Never mind the hundred thousand. We'll get that
elsewhere. I'll bet you might have darn fine original ideas to
contribute. (<i>thinking--satisfied</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There! &hellip; That'll keep my
proposition pinned up in his mind! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then jumping to his feet--briskly</i>) What do you say to a
little stroll down to the shore and back? Come on--do you good.
(<i>taking his arm and hustling him genially toward the door</i>)
What you need is exercise. You're soft as putty. Why don't you take
up golf?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with sudden resistance pulls
away--determinedly</i>) No, I won't go, Sam. I want to think out a
new plot.</p>

<p>EVANS--Oh, all right! If it's a case of work, go to it! See you
later. (<i>He goes out. A moment later the front door is heard</i>
<i>closing.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looks after him with a mixture of annoyance and</i>
<i>scornful amusement</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a fount of meaningless energy he's
tapped! &hellip; always on the go &hellip; typical terrible child
of the age &hellip; universal slogan, keep moving &hellip; moving
where? &hellip; never mind that &hellip; don't think of ends
&hellip; the means are the end &hellip; keep moving! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He laughs scornfully and sits down in Evans' chair, picking
up</i> <i>the paper and glancing at it sneeringly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It's in every headline of this daily
newer testament &hellip; going &hellip; going &hellip; never mind
the gone &hellip; we won't live to see it &hellip; and we'll be so
rich, we can buy off the deluge anyway! &hellip; even our new God
has His price! &hellip; must have! &hellip; aren't we made in His
image? &hellip; or vice-versa? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He laughs again, letting the paper drop
disdainfully--then</i> <i>bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But why am I so superior? &hellip;
where am I going? &hellip; to the same nowhere! &hellip; worse!
&hellip; I'm not even going! &hellip; I'm there! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He laughs with bitter self-pity--then begins to think
with</i> <i>amused curiosity</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Become Sam's partner? &hellip; there's
a grotesque notion! &hellip; it might revive my sense of humor
about myself, at least &hellip; I'm the logical one to help him
&hellip; I helped him to Nina &hellip; logical partner &hellip;
partner in Nina? &hellip; what inane thoughts! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a sigh</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No use trying to think out that plot
tonight &hellip; I'll try to read.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sees the book he has been reading on the couch and gets
up to</i> <i>get it. There is a ring from the front door. Marsden
turns toward it uncertainly. A pause. Then Nina's voice calls down
the stairs</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--The maid's out. Will you go to the door, Charlie?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--Surely. (<i>He goes out and opens the front door. A
pause. Then he can be heard saying resentfully</i>) Hello, Darrell.
(<i>And someone answering</i> "Hello, Marsden" <i>and coming in and
the door closing.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>from upstairs, her voice strange and excited</i>) Who
is it, Charlie?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>comes into view in the hall, opposite the doorway,
at the foot of the stairs--his voice trembling a little with
suppressed emotion</i>) It's I, Nina--Ned Darrell.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a glad cry</i>) Ned! (<i>then in a voice which
shows she is trying to control herself, and is frightened now</i>)
I--make yourself at home. I'll be down--in a minute or two.
(<i>Darrell remains standing looking up the stairs in a sort of
joyous stupor. Marsden stares at him.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>sharply</i>) Come on in and sit down. (<i>Darrell
starts, comes into the room, plainly getting a grip on himself.
Marsden follows him, glaring at his back with enmity and suspicion.
Darrell moves as far away from him as possible, sitting down on the
sofa at right. Marsden takes Evans' chair by the table. Darrell is
pale, thin, nervous, unhealthy looking. There are lines of
desperation in his face, puffy shadows of dissipation and
sleeplessness under his restless, harried eyes. He is dressed
carelessly, almost shabbily. His eyes wander about the room,
greedily taking it in.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking disjointedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Here again! &hellip; dreamed of this
house &hellip; from here, ran away &hellip; I've come back &hellip;
my turn to be happy! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>watching him--savagely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Now I know! &hellip; absolutely!
&hellip; his face! &hellip; her voice! &hellip; they did love each
other! &hellip; they do now! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>sharply</i>) When did you get back from Europe?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>curtly</i>) This morning on the Olympic.
(<i>thinking--cautiously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Look out for this fellow &hellip;
always had it in for me &hellip; like a woman &hellip; smells out
love &hellip; he suspected before &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then boldly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well, who gives a damn now? &hellip;
all got to come out! &hellip; Nina wanted to tell Sam &hellip; now
I'll tell him myself! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>righteously indignant</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What has brought him back? &hellip;
what a devilish, cowardly trick to play on poor unsuspecting Sam!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>revengefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I'm not unsuspecting! &hellip; I'm
not their fool! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>coldly</i>) What brought you back so soon? When I saw you in
Munich you weren't intending--</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>shortly</i>) My father died three weeks ago. I've
had to come back about his estate. (<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Lie &hellip; Father's death just gave
me an excuse to myself &hellip; wouldn't have come back for that
&hellip; came back because I love her! &hellip; damn his questions!
&hellip; I want to think &hellip; before I see her &hellip; sound
of her voice &hellip; seemed to burn inside my head &hellip; God,
I'm licked! &hellip; no use fighting it &hellip; I've done my
damnedest &hellip; work &hellip; booze &hellip; other women
&hellip; no use &hellip; I love her! &hellip; always! &hellip; to
hell with pride! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He has two brothers &hellip; they'll
probably all share equally &hellip; his father noted Philadelphia
surgeon &hellip; rich, I've heard &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a bitter grin</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Wait till Sam hears that! &hellip;
he'll ask Darrell to back him &hellip; and Darrell will jump at it
&hellip; chance to avert suspicion &hellip; conscience money, too!
&hellip; it's my duty to protect Sam &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>as he hears Nina coming down the stairs</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must watch them &hellip; it's my duty
to protect Nina from herself &hellip; Sam is a simpleton &hellip;
I'm all she has &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>hearing her coming--in a panic--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Coming! &hellip; in a second I'll see
her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>terrified</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Does she still love me? &hellip; she
may have forgotten &hellip; no, it's my child &hellip; she can
never forget that! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Nina comes in from the rear. She has put on a fresh dress,
her hair is arranged, her face newly rouged and powdered, she looks
extremely pretty and this is heightened by the feverish state of
mind she is in--a mixture of love, of triumphant egotism in knowing
her lover has come back to her, and of fear and uncertainty in
feeling her new peace, her certainties, her contented absorption in
her child failing her. She hesitates just inside the door, staring
into Darrell's eyes, thinking a fierce question.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Does he still love me? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then triumphantly as she reads him</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Yes! &hellip; he does! &hellip; he
does! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>who has jumped to his feet--with a cry of
longing</i>) Nina! (<i>thinking with alarm now</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's changed! &hellip; changed!
&hellip; can't tell if she loves! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He has started to go to her. Now he hesitates. His voice
taking on a pleading uncertain quality</i>) Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking triumphantly--with a certain cruelty</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He loves me! &hellip; he's mine
&hellip; now more than ever! &hellip; he'll never dare leave me
again! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Certain of herself now, she comes to him and speaks with
confident pleasure.</i>) Hello, Ned! This is a wonderful surprise!
How are you? (<i>She takes his hand.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>taken aback--confusedly</i>) Oh--all right, Nina.
(<i>thinking in a panic</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That tone! &hellip; as if she didn't
care! &hellip; can't believe that! &hellip; she's playing a game to
fool Marsden! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>who is watching them keenly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She loves his love for her &hellip;
she's cruelly confident &hellip; much as I hate this man I can't
help feeling sorry &hellip; I know her cruelty &hellip; it's time I
took a hand in this &hellip; what a plot for a novel! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>almost mockingly</i>) Darrell's father died, Nina. He had to
come home to see about the estate.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with a glare at Marsden--protestingly</i>) I was
coming home anyway. I only intended to stay a year, and it's over
that since--(<i>intensely</i>) I was coming back anyway, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with triumphant happiness</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">You dear, you! &hellip; as if I didn't
know that! &hellip; oh, how I'd love to take you in my arms!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>happily</i>) I'm awfully glad you've come, Ned. We've missed
you terribly.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking--more and more at sea</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She looks glad &hellip; but she's
changed &hellip; I don't understand her &hellip; "we've missed"
&hellip; that means Sam &hellip; what does that mean? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>intensely, pressing her hand</i>) And I've missed
you--terribly!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>sardonically</i>) Yes, indeed, Darrell, I can vouch
for their missing you--Sam in particular. He was asking about you
only a short while ago--how things were going with you when I saw
you in Munich. (<i>maliciously</i>) By the way, who was the lady
you were with that day? She was certainly startling looking.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--triumphantly mocking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">A miss, Charlie! &hellip; he loves me!
&hellip; what do I care about that woman? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>gaily</i>) Yes, who was the mysterious beauty, Ned? Do tell
us! (<i>She moves away from him and sits down at center. Darrell
remains standing.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>glaring at Marsden, sullenly</i>) Oh, I don't
remember--(<i>thinking apprehensively with a bitter
resentment</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She doesn't give a damn! &hellip; if
she loved me she'd be jealous! &hellip; but she doesn't give a
damn! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He blurts out resentfully at Nina</i>) Well, she was my
mistress--for a time--I was lonely. (<i>then with sudden anger
turning on Marsden</i>) But what's all this to you, Marsden?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>coolly</i>) Absolutely nothing. Pardon me. It was a
tactless question. (<i>then with continued open malice</i>) But I
was starting to say how Sam had missed you, Darrell. It's really
remarkable. One doesn't encounter such friendship often in these
slack days. Why, he'd trust you with anything!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>wincing--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That hurts &hellip; hurts Ned &hellip;
Charlie is being cruel! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>wincing--in a forced tone</i>) And I'd trust Sam
with anything.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--Of course. He is a person one can trust. They are rare.
You're going to be amazed at the change in Sam, Darrell. Isn't he,
Nina? He's a new man. I never saw such energy. If ever a man was
bound for success Sam is. In fact, I'm so confident he is that as
soon as he thinks the time is ripe to start his own firm I'm going
to furnish the capital and become his silent partner.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>puzzled and irritated--thinking confusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's he driving at? &hellip; why
doesn't he get the hell out and leave us alone? &hellip; but I'm
glad Sam is on his feet &hellip; makes it easier to tell him the
truth.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--worriedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's Charlie talking about? &hellip;
it's time I talked to Ned &hellip; Oh, Ned, I do love you! &hellip;
you can be my lover! &hellip; we won't hurt Sam! &hellip; he'll
never know! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--Yes, ever since the baby was born Sam's been another
man--in fact, ever since he knew there was going to be a baby,
isn't it, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>agreeing as if she had only half-heard him</i>) Yes.
(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned's baby! &hellip; I must talk to him
about our baby.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--Sam is the proudest parent I've ever seen!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>as before</i>) Yes, Sam makes a wonderful father, Ned.
(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned doesn't care for children &hellip;
I know what you're hoping, Ned &hellip; but if you think I'm going
to take Sam's baby from him, you're mistaken! &hellip; or if you
think I'll run away with you and leave my baby &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with the same strange driving insistence</i>) If
anything happened to that child I actually believe Sam would lose
his reason! Don't you think so, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with emphasis</i>) I know I'd lose mine! Little Gordon
has become my whole life.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking--with a sad bitter irony</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Sam &hellip; wonderful father &hellip;
lose his reason &hellip; little Gordon! &hellip; Nina called my son
after Gordon! &hellip; romantic imagination! &hellip; Gordon is
still her lover! &hellip; Gordon, Sam and Nina! &hellip; and my
son! &hellip; closed corporation! &hellip; I'm forced out!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then rebelling furiously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No! &hellip; not yet, by God! &hellip;
I'll smash it up! &hellip; I'll tell Sam the truth no matter what!
&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with a strange calculation</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I couldn't find a better husband than
Sam &hellip; and I couldn't find a better lover than Ned &hellip; I
need them both to be happy &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with sudden despairing suspicion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Good God &hellip; after all, is it
Sam's child? &hellip; mightn't it be Darrell's! &hellip; why have I
never thought of that? &hellip; No! &hellip; Nina couldn't be so
vile! &hellip; to go on living with Sam, pretending &hellip; and,
after all, why should she, you fool? &hellip; there's no sense!
&hellip; she could have gone off with Darrell, couldn't she?
&hellip; Sam would have given her a divorce &hellip; there was no
possible reason for her staying with Sam, when she loved Darrell,
unless exactly because this was Sam's baby &hellip; for its sake
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>hectically relieved</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Of course! &hellip; of course! &hellip;
that's all right! &hellip; I love that poor baby now! &hellip; I'll
fight for its sake against these two! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>smilingly gets to his feet--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I can leave them alone now &hellip; for
they won't be alone, thanks to me! &hellip; I leave Sam and his
baby in this room with them &hellip; and their honor &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>suddenly raging</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Their honor! &hellip; what an obscene
joke! &hellip; the honor of a harlot and a pimp! &hellip; I hate
them! &hellip; if only God would strike them dead! &hellip; now!
&hellip; and I could see them die! &hellip; I would praise His
justice! &hellip; His kindness and mercy to me! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--with horrified confusion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why doesn't Charlie go? &hellip; What
is he thinking? &hellip; I suddenly feel afraid of him!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She gets to her feet with a confused pleading cry.</i>)
Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>immediately urbane and smiling</i>) It's all right.
I'm going out to find Sam. When he knows you're here he'll come on
the run, Darrell. (<i>He goes to the door. They watch him
suspiciously.</i>) And you two probably have a lot to talk over.
(<i>He chuckles pleasantly and goes into the hall--mockingly
warning</i>) We'll be back before long. (<i>The front door is heard
slamming. Nina and Darrell turn and look at each other guiltily and
frightenedly. Then he comes to her and takes both of her hands
uncertainly.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>stammeringly</i>) Nina--I--I've come back to
you--do you--do you still care--Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>giving way to his love passionately, as if to drown
her fears</i>) I love you, Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>kisses her awkwardly--stammering</i>) I--I didn't
know--you seemed so cold--damn Marsden--he suspects, doesn't
he?--but it makes no difference now, does it? (<i>then in a flood
of words</i>) Oh, it's been hell, Nina! I couldn't forget you!
Other women--they only made me love you more! I hated them and
loved you even at the moment when--that's honest! It was always you
in my arms--as you used to be--those afternoons--God, how I've
thought of them--lying awake--recalling every word you said, each
movement, each expression on your face, smelling your hair, feeling
your soft body--(<i>suddenly taking her in his arms and kissing her
again and again--passionately</i>) Nina! I love you so!</p>

<p>NINA--And I've longed for you so much! Do you think I've
forgotten those afternoons? (<i>then in anguish</i>) Oh, Ned, why
did you run away? I can never forgive that! I can never trust you
again!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>violently</i>) I was a fool! I thought of Sam! And
that wasn't all! Oh, I wasn't all noble, I'll confess! I thought of
myself and my career! Damn my career! A lot of good that did it! I
didn't study! I didn't live! I longed for you--and suffered! I paid
in full, believe me, Nina! But I know better now! I've come back.
The time for lying is past! You've got to come away with me! (<i>He
kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>letting herself go, kissing him passionately</i>) Yes!
My lover! (<i>then suddenly resisting and pushing him away</i>) No!
You're forgetting Sam--and Sam's baby!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>staring at her wildly</i>) Sam's baby? Are you
joking? Ours, you mean! We'll take him with us, of course!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sadly</i>) And Sam?</p>

<p>DARRELL--Damn Sam! He's got to give you a divorce! Let him be
generous for a change!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sadly but determinedly</i>) He would be. You must be
just to Sam. He'd give his life for my happiness. And this would
mean his life. Could we be happy then? You know we couldn't! And
I've changed, Ned. You've got to realize that. I'm not your old mad
Nina. I still love you. I will always love you. But now I love my
baby too. His happiness comes first with me!</p>

<p>DARRELL--But--he's mine, too!</p>

<p>NINA--No! You gave him to Sam to save Sam!</p>

<p>DARRELL--To hell with Sam! It was to make you happy!</p>

<p>NINA--So I could make Sam happy! That was in it too! I was
sincere in that, Ned! If I hadn't been, I could never have gone to
you that first day--or if I had, I'd never have forgiven myself.
But as it is I don't feel guilty or wicked. I have made Sam happy!
And I'm proud! I love Sam's happiness! I love the devoted husband
and father in him! And I feel it's his baby--that we've made it his
baby!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>distractedly</i>) Nina! For God's sake! You haven't
come to love Sam, have you? Then--I'll go--I'll go away again--I'll
never come back--I tried not to this time--but I had to, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>taking him in her arms--with sudden alarm</i>) No,
don't go away, Ned--ever again. I don't love Sam! I love you!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>miserably</i>) But I don't understand! Sam gets
everything--and I have nothing!</p>

<p>NINA--You have my love! (<i>with a strange, self-assured smile
at him</i>) It seems to me you're complaining unreasonably!</p>

<p>DARRELL--You mean--I can be--your lover again?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>simply, even matter-of-factly</i>) Isn't that the
nearest we can come to making everyone happy? That's all that
counts.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with a harsh laugh</i>) And is that what you call
playing fair to Sam?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>simply</i>) Sam will never know. The happiness I have
given him has made him too sure of himself ever to suspect me now.
And as long as we can love each other without danger to him, I feel
he owes that to us for all we've done for him. (<i>with
finality</i>) That's the only possible solution, Ned, for all our
sakes, now you've come back to me.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>repulsed</i>) Nina! How can you be so inhuman and
calculating!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>stung--mockingly</i>) It was you who taught me the
scientific approach, Doctor!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>shrinking back from her--threateningly</i>) Then
I'll leave again! I'll go back to Europe! I won't endure--!
(<i>then in a queer, futile rage</i>) You think I'll stay--to be
your lover--watching Sam with my wife and my child--you think
that's what I came back to you for? You can go to hell, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>calmly--sure of him</i>) But what else can I do, Ned?
(<i>then warningly</i>) I hear them coming, dear. It's Sam, you
know.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>in a frenzy</i>) What else can you do? Liar! But I
can do something else! I can smash your calculating game for you! I
can tell Sam--and I will--right now--by God, I will!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>quietly</i>) No. You won't, Ned. You can't do that to
Sam.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>savagely</i>) Like hell I can't! (<i>The front door
is opened. Evans' voice is immediately heard, even before he bounds
into the room. He rushes up to Ned hilariously, shakes his hand and
pounds his back, oblivious to Darrell's wild expression.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--You old son of a gun! Why didn't you let a guy know you
were coming? We'd have met you at the dock, and brought the baby.
Let me have a look at you! You look thinner. We'll fatten you up,
won't we, Nina? Let us do the prescribing this time! Why didn't you
let us know where you were, you old bum? We wanted to write you
about the baby. And I wanted to boast about how I was getting on!
You're the only person in the world--except Nina and Charlie--I
would boast about that to.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>affectionately</i>) Mercy, Sam, give Ned a chance to
get a word in! (<i>looking at Ned pityingly but challengingly</i>)
He wants to tell you something, Sam.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>crushed--stammers</i>) No--I mean, yes--I want to
tell you how damn glad I am &hellip; (<i>He turns away, his face is
screwed up in his effort to hold back his tears. Thinking
miserably</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I can't tell him! &hellip; God damn
him, I can't! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a strange triumphant calm</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There! &hellip; that's settled for all
time! &hellip; poor Ned! &hellip; how crushed he looks! &hellip; I
mustn't let Sam look at him! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She steps between them protectingly.</i>) Where's Charlie,
Sam?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>appearing from the hall</i>) Here, Nina. Always
here! (<i>He comes to her, smiling with assurance.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>suddenly with a strange unnatural elation--looking
from one to the other with triumphant possession</i>) Yes, you're
here, Charlie--always! And you, Sam--and Ned! (<i>with a strange
gaiety</i>) Sit down, all of you! Make yourselves at home! You are
my three men! This is your home with me! (<i>then in a strange
half-whisper</i>) Ssshh! I thought I heard the baby. You must all
sit down and be very quiet. You must not wake our baby.
(<i>Mechanically the three sit down, careful to make no
noise--Evans in his old place by the table, Marsden at center,
Darrell on the sofa at right. They sit staring before them in
silence. Nina remains standing, dominating them, a little behind
and to the left of Marsden.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking abjectly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I couldn't! &hellip; there are things
one may not do and live with oneself afterwards &hellip; there are
things one may not say &hellip; memory is too full of echoes!
&hellip; there are secrets one must not reveal &hellip; memory is
lined with mirrors! &hellip; he was too happy! &hellip; to kill
happiness is a worse murder than taking life! &hellip; I gave him
that happiness! &hellip; Sam deserves my happiness! &hellip; God
bless you, Sam! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then in a strange objective tone--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">My experiment with the guinea pigs has
been a success &hellip; the ailing ones, Sam, and the female, Nina,
have been restored to health and normal function &hellip; only the
other male, Ned, seems to have suffered deterioration. &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then bitterly humble</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Nothing left but to accept her terms
&hellip; I love her &hellip; I can help to make her happy &hellip;
half a loaf is better &hellip; to a starving man&hellip; .</p>

<p>(<i>glancing over at Evans--bitterly gloating</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">And your child is mine! &hellip; your
wife is mine! &hellip; your happiness is mine! &hellip; may you
enjoy my happiness, her husband! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>looking at Darrell affectionately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Sure good to see Ned again &hellip; a
real friend if there ever was one &hellip; looks blue about
something &hellip; oh, that's right, Charlie said his old man had
kicked in &hellip; his old man was rich &hellip; that's an idea
&hellip; I'll bet he'd put up that capital &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then ashamed of himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Aw hell, what's the matter with me?
&hellip; he's no sooner here than I start &hellip; he's done enough
&hellip; forget it! &hellip; now anyway &hellip; he looks pretty
dissipated &hellip; too many women &hellip; ought to get married
and settle down &hellip; tell him that if I didn't think he'd laugh
at me giving him advice &hellip; but he'll soon realize I'm not the
old Sam he knew &hellip; I suppose Nina's been boasting about that
already &hellip; she's proud &hellip; she's helped me &hellip;
she's a wonderful wife and mother &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>looking up at her--solicitously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She acted a bit nervous just now
&hellip; queer &hellip; like she used to &hellip; haven't noticed
her that way in a long time &hellip; suppose it's the excitement of
Ned turning up &hellip; mustn't let her get over-excited &hellip;
bad for the baby's milk.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>glancing furtively over his shoulder at
Nina--broodingly thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's the old queer Nina now &hellip;
the Nina I could never fathom &hellip; her three men! &hellip; and
we are! &hellip; I? &hellip; yes, more deeply than either of the
others since I serve for nothing &hellip; a queer kind of love,
maybe &hellip; I am not ordinary! &hellip; our child &hellip; what
could she mean by that? &hellip; child of us three? &hellip; on the
surface, that's insane &hellip; but I felt when she said it there
was something in it &hellip; she has strange devious intuitions
that tap the hidden currents of life &hellip; dark intermingling
currents that become the one stream of desire &hellip; I feel, with
regard to Nina, my life queerly identified with Sam's and Darrell's
&hellip; her child is the child of our three loves for her &hellip;
I would like to believe that &hellip; I would like to be her
husband in a sense &hellip; and the father of a child, after my
fashion &hellip; I could forgive her everything &hellip; permit
everything &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>determinedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">And I do forgive! &hellip; and I will
not meddle hereafter more than is necessary to guard her happiness,
and Sam's and our baby's &hellip; as for Darrell, I am no longer
jealous of him &hellip; she is only using his love for her own
happiness &hellip; he can never take her away from me! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>more and more strangely triumphant</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">My three men! &hellip; I feel their
desires converge in me! &hellip; to form one complete beautiful
male desire which I absorb &hellip; and am whole &hellip; they
dissolve in me, their life is my life &hellip; I am pregnant with
the three! &hellip; husband! &hellip; lover! &hellip; father!
&hellip; and the fourth man! &hellip; little man! &hellip; little
Gordon! &hellip; he is mine too! &hellip; that makes it perfect!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with an extravagant suppressed exultance</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why, I should be the proudest woman on
earth! &hellip; I should be the happiest woman in the world!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then suppressing an outbreak of hysterical triumphant
laughter only by a tremendous effort</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ha-ha &hellip; only I better knock wood
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She raps with both knuckles in a fierce tattoo on the
table.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">before God the Father hears my
happiness! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>as the three turn to her--anxiously</i>) Nina? What's
the matter?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>controlling herself with a great effort comes to
him--forcing a smile--puts her arms around him affectionately</i>)
Nothing, dear. Nerves, that's all. I've gotten over-tired, I
guess.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>bullying her--with loving authority</i>) Then you go
right to bed, young lady! We'll excuse you.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>quietly and calmly now</i>) All right, dear. I guess I
do need to rest. (<i>She kisses him as she might kiss a big brother
she loved--affectionately</i>) Good night, you bossy old thing,
you!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>with deep tenderness</i>) Good night, darling.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>She goes and kisses Charlie dutifully on the cheek as
she might her father--affectionately</i>) Good night, Charlie.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with a touch of her father's manner</i>) That's a
good girl! Good night, dear.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>She goes and kisses Darrell lovingly on the lips as
she would kiss her lover.</i>) Good night, Ned.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>looks at her with grateful humility</i>) Thank you.
Good night. (<i>She turns and walks quietly out of the room. The
eyes of the three men follow her.</i>)</p>

<p align="center">(<i>Curtain</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a07" id="a07">ACT SEVEN</a>
</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>Nearly eleven years later. The sitting room of the
Evans' apartment on Park Avenue, New York City--a room that is a
tribute to Nina's good taste. It is a large, sunny room, the
furniture expensive but extremely simple. The arrangement of the
furniture shown is as in previous scenes except there are more
pieces. Two chairs are by the table at left. There is a smaller
table at center, and a chaise longue. A large, magnificently
comfortable sofa is at right.</i></p>

<p><i>It is about one in the afternoon of a day in early fall. Nina
and Darrell and their son, Gordon, are in the room. Nina is
reclining on the chaise longue watching Gordon who is sitting on
the floor near her, turning over the pages of a book. Darrell is
sitting by the table at left, watching Nina.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Nina is thirty-five, in the full bloom of her womanhood. She
is slimmer than in the previous scene. Her skin still retains a
trace of summer tan and she appears in the pink of physical
condition. But as in the first act of the play, there is beneath
this a sense of great mental strain. One notices the many lines in
her face at second glance. Her eyes are tragically sad in repose
and her expression is set and masklike.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Gordon is eleven--a fine boy with, even at this age, the
figure of an athlete. He looks older than he is. There is a grave
expression to his face. His eyes are full of a quick-tempered
sensitiveness. He does not noticeably resemble his mother. He looks
nothing at all like his father. He seems to have sprung from a line
distinct from any of the people we have seen.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Darrell has aged greatly. His hair is streaked with gray. He
has grown stout. His face is a bit jowly and puffy under the eyes.
The features have become blurred. He has the look of a man with no
definite aim or ambition to which he can relate his living. His
eyes are embittered and they hide his inner self-resentment behind
a pose of cynical indifference.</i>
</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking as he plays--resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I wish Darrell'd get out of here!
&hellip; why couldn't Mother let me run my own birthday? &hellip;
I'd never had him here, you bet! &hellip; what's he always hanging
'round for? &hellip; why don't he go off on one of his old trips
again &hellip; last time he was gone more'n a year &hellip; I was
hoping he'd died! &hellip; what makes Mother like him so much?
&hellip; she makes me sick! &hellip; I'd think she'd get sick of
the old fool and tell him to get out and never come back! &hellip;
I'd kick him out if I was big enough! &hellip; it's good for him he
didn't bring me any birthday present or I'd smash it first chance I
got! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>watching him--brooding with loving
tenderness--sadly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No longer my baby &hellip; my little
man &hellip; eleven &hellip; I can't believe it &hellip; I'm
thirty-five &hellip; five years more &hellip; at forty a woman has
finished living &hellip; life passes by her &hellip; she rots away
in peace! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>intensely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I want to rot away in peace! &hellip;
I'm sick of the fight for happiness! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>smiling with a wry amusement at herself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What ungrateful thoughts on my son's
birthday! &hellip; my love for him has been happiness &hellip; how
handsome he is! &hellip; not at all like Ned &hellip; when I was
carrying him I was fighting to forget Ned &hellip; hoping he might
be like Gordon &hellip; and he is &hellip; poor Ned, I've made him
suffer a great deal &hellip; !</p>

<p>(<i>She looks over at Darrell--self-mockingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">My lover! &hellip; so very rarely now,
those interludes of passion &hellip; what has bound us together all
these years? &hellip; love? &hellip; if he could only have been
contented with what I was able to give him! &hellip; but he has
always wanted more &hellip; yet never had the courage to insist on
all or nothing &hellip; proud without being proud enough! &hellip;
he has shared me for his comfort's sake with a little gratitude and
a big bitterness &hellip; and sharing me has corrupted him!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, I can't blame myself! &hellip; no
woman can make a man happy who has no purpose in life! &hellip; why
did he give up his career? &hellip; because I had made him weak?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with resentful scorn</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, it was I who shamed him into taking
up biology and starting the station at Antigua &hellip; if I hadn't
he'd simply have hung around me year after year, doing nothing
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>irritatedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why does he stay so long? &hellip; over
six months &hellip; I can't stand having him around me that long
any more! &hellip; why doesn't he go back to the West Indies?
&hellip; I always get a terrible feeling after he's been back a
while that he's waiting for Sam to die! &hellip; or go insane!
&hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking--with an apathetic bitterness</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What is she thinking? &hellip; we sit
together in silence, thinking &hellip; thoughts that never know the
other's thoughts &hellip; our love has become the intimate thinking
together of thoughts that are strangers &hellip; our love! &hellip;
well, whatever it is that has bound us together, it's strong!
&hellip; I've broken with her, run away, tried to forget her
&hellip; running away to come back each time more abject! &hellip;
or, if she saw there was some chance I might break loose, she'd
find some way to call me back &hellip; and I'd forget my longing
for freedom, I'd come wagging my tail &hellip; no, guinea pigs have
no tails &hellip; I hope my experiment has proved something!
&hellip; Sam &hellip; happy and wealthy &hellip; and healthy!
&hellip; I used to hope he'd break down &hellip; I'd watch him and
read symptoms of insanity into every move he made &hellip;
despicable? &hellip; certainly, but love makes one either noble or
despicable! &hellip; he only grew healthier &hellip; now I've given
up watching him &hellip; almost entirely &hellip; now I watch him
grow fat and I laugh! &hellip; the huge joke has dawned on me!
&hellip; Sam is the only normal one! &hellip; we lunatics! &hellip;
Nina and I! &hellip; have made a sane life for him out of our
madness! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>watching Nina--sadly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Always thinking of her son &hellip;
well, I gave him to her &hellip; Gordon &hellip; I hate that name
&hellip; why do I continue hanging around here? &hellip; each time
after a few months my love changes to bitterness &hellip; I blame
Nina for the mess I've made of life &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>suddenly turning on him</i>) When are you going back
to the West Indies, Ned?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>determinedly</i>) Soon!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>stops playing to listen--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gosh, I'm glad! &hellip; How soon, I
wonder? &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a trace of a sneer</i>) I don't see how you can
afford to leave your work for such long periods. Don't you grow
rusty?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>looking at her meaningly</i>) My life work is to
rust--nicely and unobtrusively! (<i>He smiles mockingly.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sadly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">To rot away in peace &hellip; that's
all he wants now, too! &hellip; and this is what love has done to
us! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>bitterly</i>) My work was finished twelve years
ago. As I believe you know, I ended it with an experiment which
resulted so successfully that any further meddling with human lives
would have been superfluous!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>pityingly</i>) Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>indifferent and cynical</i>) But you meant my
present dabbling about. You know better than to call that work.
It's merely my hobby. Our backing Sam has made Marsden and me so
wealthy that we're forced to take up hobbies. Marsden goes in for
his old one of dashing off genteel novels, while I play at biology.
Sam argued that golf would be healthier and less nonsensical for
me, but you insisted on biology. And give it its due, it has kept
me out in the open air and been conducive to travelling and
broadening my mind! (<i>then forcing a smile</i>) But I'm
exaggerating. I really am interested, or I'd never keep financing
the Station. And when I'm down there I do work hard, helping
Preston. He's doing remarkable work already, and he's still in his
twenties. He'll be a big man--(<i>his bitterness cropping up
again</i>) at least if he takes my advice and never carries his
experiments as far as human lives!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in a low voice</i>) How can you be so bitter, Ned--on
Gordon's birthday?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She expects me to love the child she
deliberately took from me and gave to another man! &hellip; no,
thank you, Nina! &hellip; I've been hurt enough! &hellip; I'll not
leave myself open there! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>regarding his son bitterly</i>) Every day he gets more like
Sam, doesn't he?</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's talking about me &hellip; he
better look out! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>resentfully</i>) I don't think Gordon resembles Sam at
all. He reminds me a great deal of his namesake.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>touched on a sore spot--with a nasty
laugh--cuttingly</i>) Gordon Shaw? Not the slightest bit in the
world! And you ought to thank God he doesn't! It's the last thing
I'd want wished on a boy of mine--to be like that rah-rah hero!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking contemptuously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Boy of his! &hellip; He hasn't got a
boy! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>amused and pleased by his jealousy</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor Ned! &hellip; isn't he silly?
&hellip; at his age, after all we've been through, to still feel
jealous &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--I'd much rather have him (<i>pointing to Gordon</i>)
grow up to be an exact duplicate of the esteemed Samuel!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's always making fun of my father!
&hellip; he better look out! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>more and more mockingly</i>) And what could be
fairer? The good Samuel is an A one success. He has a charming wife
and a darling boy, and a Park Avenue apartment and a membership in
an expensive golf club. And, above all, he rests so complacently on
the proud assurance that he is self-made!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sharply</i>) Ned! You ought to be ashamed! You know
how grateful Sam has always been to you!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>bitingly</i>) Would he be grateful if he knew how
much I'd really done for him?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sternly</i>) Ned!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>suddenly jumps up and confronts Darrell, his fists
clenched, trembling with rage, stammers</i>) You--shut up--making
fun of my father!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in dismay</i>) Gordon!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>mockingly</i>) My dear boy, I wouldn't make fun of
your father for the world!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>baffledly--his lips trembling</i>) You--you did,
too! (<i>then intensely</i>) I hate you!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>shocked and indignant</i>) Gordon! How dare you talk
like that to your Uncle Ned!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>rebelliously</i>) He's not my uncle! He's not my
anything!</p>

<p>NINA--Not another word or you'll be punished, whether it's your
birthday or not! If you can't behave better than that, I'll have to
phone to all your friends they mustn't come here this afternoon,
that you've been so bad you can't have a party! (<i>thinking
remorsefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Is this my fault? &hellip; I've done my
best to get him to love Ned! &hellip; but it only makes him worse!
&hellip; it makes him turn against me! &hellip; turn from me to
Sam! &hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>sullenly</i>) I don't care! I'll tell Dad!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>peremptorily</i>) Leave the room! And don't come near
me again, do you hear, until you've apologized to Uncle Ned!
(<i>thinking angrily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Dad! &hellip; It's always Dad with him
now! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>boredly</i>) Oh, never mind, Nina!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>going out--mutters</i>) I won't
'pologize--never!</p>

<p>(<i>thinking vindictively</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hate her too when she sides with him!
&hellip; I don't care if she is my mother! &hellip; she has no
right! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He goes out, rear.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>irritably</i>) What if he does hate me? I don't
blame him! He suspects what I know--that I've acted like a coward
and a weakling toward him! I should have claimed him no matter what
happened to other people! Whose fault is it if he hates me, and I
dislike him because he loves another father? Ours! You gave him to
Sam and I consented! All right! Then don't blame him for acting
like Sam's son!</p>

<p>NINA--But he shouldn't say he hates you. (<i>thinking
bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Sam's! &hellip; he's becoming all
Sam's! &hellip; I'm getting to mean nothing! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>sardonically</i>) Perhaps he realizes
subconsciously that I am his father, his rival in your love; but
I'm not his father ostensibly, there are no taboos, so he can come
right out and hate me to his heart's content! (<i>bitterly</i>) If
he realized how little you love me any more, he wouldn't
bother!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>exasperatedly</i>) Oh, Ned, do shut up! I can't stand
hearing those same old reproaches I've heard a thousand times
before! I can't bear to hear myself making the same old bitter
counter-accusations. And then there'll be the same old terrible
scene of hate and you'll run away--it used to be to drink and
women, now it's to the Station. Or I'll send you away, and then
after a time I'll call you back, because I'll have gotten so lonely
again living this lonely lie of my life, with no one to speak to
except Sam's business friends and their deadly wives. (<i>She
laughs helplessly.</i>) Or else you'll get lonely in your lie a
little before I do and come back again of your own desire! And then
we'll kiss and cry and love each other again!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with an ironical grimace</i>) Or I might cheat
myself into believing I'd fallen in love with some nice girl and
get myself engaged to be married again as I did once before! And
then you'd be jealous again and have to find some way of getting me
to break it off!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>forlornly amused</i>) Yes--I suppose the thought of a
wife taking you away from me would be too much--again! (<i>then
helplessly</i>) Oh, Ned, when are we ever going to learn something
about each other? We act like such brainless fools--with our love.
It's always so wonderful when you first come back, but you always
stay too long--or I always keep you too long! You never leave
before we've come to the ugly bitter stage when we blame each
other! (<i>then suddenly forlornly tender</i>) Is it possible you
can still love me, Ned?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>mournfully smiling</i>) I must, or I'd never act
this fool way, would I?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>smiling back</i>) And I must love you. (<i>then
seriously</i>) After all, I can never forget that Gordon is the
child of your love, Ned.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>sadly</i>) You'd better forget that, for his sake
and your own. Children have sure intuitions. He feels cheated of
your love--by me. So he's concentrating his affections on Sam whose
love he knows is secure, and withdrawing from you.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>frightened--angrily</i>) Don't be stupid, Ned! That
isn't so at all! I hate you when you talk that way!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>cynically</i>) Hate me, exactly. As he does! That's
what I'm advising you to do if you want to keep his love! (<i>He
smiles grimly.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sharply</i>) If Gordon doesn't love you it's because
you've never made the slightest attempt to be lovable to him!
There's no earthly reason why he should like you, when you come
right down to it, Ned! Take today, for instance. It's his birthday
but you'd forgotten, or didn't care! You never even brought him a
present.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with bitter sadness</i>) I did bring him a present.
It's out in the hall. I bought him a costly delicate one so he
could get full satisfaction and yet not strain himself when he
smashed it, as he's smashed every present of mine in the past! And
I left it out in the hall, to be given to him after I've gone
because, after all, he is my son and I'd prefer he didn't smash it
before my eyes! (<i>trying to mock his own emotion back--with
savage bitterness</i>) I'm selfish, you see! I don't want my son to
be too happy at my expense, even on his birthday!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>tormented by love and pity and remorse</i>) Ned! For
God's sake! How can you torture us like that! Oh, it's too
dreadful--what I have done to you! Forgive me, Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>his expression changing to one of pity for
her--goes to her and puts his hand on her head--tenderly</i>) I'm
sorry. (<i>with remorseful tenderness</i>) Dreadful, what you've
done, Nina? Why, you've given me the only happiness I've ever
known! And no matter what I may say or do in bitterness, I'm
proud--and grateful, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>looks up at him with deep tenderness and
admiration</i>) Dearest, it's wonderful of you to say that! (<i>She
gets up and puts her hands on his shoulders and looks into his
eyes--tenderly in a sort of pleading</i>) Can't we be brave
enough--for you to go away--now, on this note--sure of our
love--with no ugly bitterness for once?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>joyfully</i>) Yes! I'll go--this minute if you
wish!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>playfully</i>) Oh, you needn't go this minute! Wait
and say good-bye to Sam. He'd be terribly hurt if you didn't.
(<i>then seriously</i>) And will you promise to stay away two
years--even if I call you back before then--and work this time,
really work?</p>

<p>DARRELL--I'll try, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--And then--surely come back to me!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>smiling</i>) Surely--again!</p>

<p>NINA--Then good-bye, dear! (<i>She kisses him.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--Again! (<i>He smiles and she smiles and they kiss
again. Gordon appears in the doorway at rear and stands for a
moment in a passion of jealousy and rage and grief, watching
them.</i>)</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking with a strange tortured shame</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I mustn't see her! &hellip; pretend I
didn't see her! &hellip; mustn't never let her know I saw her!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He vanishes as silently as he had come.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>suddenly moving away from Darrell, looking around her
uneasily</i>) Ned, did you see--? I had the queerest feeling just
then that someone--</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>His voice sounds from the hall with a strained
casualness.</i>) Mother! Uncle Charlie's downstairs. Shall he come
right up?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>startled, her own voice straining to be casual</i>)
Yes, dear--of course! (<i>then worriedly</i>) His voice sounded
funny. Did it to you? Do you suppose he--?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with a wry smile</i>) It's possible. To be on the
safe side, you'd better tell him you kissed me good-bye to get rid
of me! (<i>then angrily</i>) So Marsden's here again! The damned
old woman! I simply can't go him any more, Nina! Why Gordon should
take such a fancy to that old sissy is beyond me!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>suddenly struck--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why, he's jealous of Gordon liking
Charlie! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>immediately all affectionate pity</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Then he must love Gordon a little!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>letting her pity escape her</i>) Poor Ned! (<i>She makes a
movement toward him.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>startled and afraid she may have guessed something
he doesn't acknowledge to himself</i>) What? Why do you say that?
(<i>then rudely defensive</i>) Don't be silly! (<i>resentfully</i>)
You know well enough what I've always held against him! I wanted to
put up all the money to back Sam when he started. I wanted to do it
for Sam's sake--but especially for my child's sake. Why did Marsden
absolutely insist on Sam letting him in equally? It isn't that I
begrudge him the money he's made, but I know there was something
queer in his mind and that he did it intentionally to spite me!
(<i>From the hallway comes the sound of Marsden's voice and
Gordon's greeting him vociferously as he lets him into the
apartment. As Darrell listens his expression becomes furious again.
He bursts out angrily</i>) You're letting that old ass spoil
Gordon, you fool, you! (<i>Marsden comes in from the rear, smiling,
immaculately dressed as usual. He looks hardly any older except
that his hair is grayer and his tall figure more stooped. His
expression and the general atmosphere he gives out are more nearly
like those of Act One. If not happy, he is at least living in
comparative peace with himself and his environment.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>comes straight to Nina</i>) Hello, Nina Cara Nina!
Congratulations on your son's birthday! (<i>He kisses her.</i>)
He's grown so much bigger and stronger in the two months since I've
seen him. (<i>He turns and shakes hands with Darrell coldly--with a
trace of a patronizing air</i>) Hello, Darrell. Last time I was
here you were leaving for the West Indies in a week but I see
you're still around.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>furious--with a mocking air</i>) And here you are
around again yourself! You're looking comfortable these days,
Marsden. I hope your sister is well. It must be a great comfort,
having her to take your mother's place! (<i>then with a harsh
laugh</i>) Yes, we're two bad pennies, eh,
Marsden?--counterfeits--fakes--Sam's silent partners!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking irritably</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned's getting hateful again! &hellip;
Poor Charlie! &hellip; I won't have him insulted! &hellip; he's
become such a comfort &hellip; he understands so much &hellip;
without my having to tell him &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>looking rebukingly at Darrell</i>) Ned is sailing this week,
Charlie.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking triumphantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's trying to insult me &hellip; I
know all he means &hellip; but what do I care what he says &hellip;
she's sending him away! &hellip; intentionally before me! &hellip;
it means he's finished! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Is she trying to humiliate me before
him? &hellip; I'll teach her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then struggling with himself--remorsefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No &hellip; not this time &hellip; I
promised &hellip; no quarrel &hellip; remember &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>acquiescing--with a pleasant nod to Marsden</i>) Yes, I'm
going this week and I expect to be gone at least two years this
time--two years of hard work.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking with scornful pity</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">His work! &hellip; what a pretense!
&hellip; a scientific dilettante! &hellip; could anything be more
pitiable? &hellip; poor chap! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>perfunctorily</i>) Biology must be an interesting study. I
wish I knew more about it.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>stung yet amused by the other's
tone--ironically</i>) Yes, so do I wish you did, Marsden! Then you
might write more about life and less about dear old ladies and
devilish bachelors! Why don't you write a novel about life
sometime, Marsden? (<i>He turns his back on Marsden with a glance
of repulsion and walks to the window and stares out.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>confusedly</i>) Yes--decidedly--but hardly in my
line--(<i>thinking in anguish--picking up a magazine and turning
over the pages aimlessly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That &hellip; is &hellip; true!
&hellip; he's full of poison! &hellip; I've never married the word
to life! &hellip; I've been a timid bachelor of Arts, not an
artist! &hellip; my poor pleasant books! &hellip; all is well!
&hellip; is this well, the three of us? &hellip; Darrell has become
less and less her lover &hellip; Nina has turned more and more to
me &hellip; we have built up a secret life of subtle sympathies and
confidences &hellip; she has known I have understood about her mere
physical passion for Darrell &hellip; what woman could be expected
to love Sam passionately? &hellip; some day she'll confide all
about Darrell to me &hellip; now that he's finished &hellip; she
knows that I love her without my telling &hellip; she even knows
the sort of love it is&hellip; .</p>

<p>(<i>passionately--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">My love is finer than any she has
known! &hellip; I do not lust for her! &hellip; I would be content
if our marriage should be purely the placing of our ashes in the
same tomb &hellip; our urns side by side and touching one another
&hellip; could the others say as much, could they love so deeply?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then suddenly miserably self-contemptuous</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What! &hellip; platonic heroics at my
age! &hellip; do I believe a word of that? &hellip; look at her
beautiful eyes! &hellip; wouldn't I give anything in life to see
them desire me? &hellip; and the intimacy I'm boasting about, what
more does it mean than that I've been playing the dear old Charlie
of her girlhood again? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>thinking in anguish</i>)</p>

<p>Damned coward and weakling! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>looking at him--pityingly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What does he always want of me?
&hellip; me? &hellip; I am the only one who senses his deep hurt
&hellip; I feel how life has wounded him &hellip; is that partly my
fault, too? &hellip; I have wounded everyone &hellip; poor Charlie,
what can I do for you? &hellip; if giving myself to you would bring
you a moment's happiness, could I? &hellip; the idea used to be
revolting &hellip; now, nothing about love seems important enough
to be revolting &hellip; poor Charlie, he only thinks he ought to
desire me! &hellip; dear Charlie, what a perfect lover he would
make for one's old age! &hellip; what a perfect lover when one was
past passion! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with sudden scornful revulsion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">These men make me sick! &hellip; I hate
all three of them! &hellip; they disgust me! &hellip; the wife and
mistress in me has been killed by them! &hellip; thank God, I am
only a mother now! &hellip; Gordon is my little man, my only man!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>suddenly</i>) I've got a job for you, Charlie--make the
salad dressing for lunch. You know, the one I'm so crazy about.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>springs to his feet</i>) Righto! (<i>He puts his
arm</i> <i>about her waist and they go out together laughingly,
without a</i> <i>glance at Darrell.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking dully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I mustn't stay to lunch &hellip; ghost
at my son's feast! &hellip; I better go now &hellip; why wait for
Sam? &hellip; what is there to say to him I can say? &hellip; and
there's nothing about him I want to see &hellip; he's as healthy as
a pig &hellip; and as sane &hellip; I was afraid once his mother
had lied to Nina &hellip; I went upstate and investigated &hellip;
true, every word of it &hellip; his great-grandfather, his
grandmother, his father, were all insane &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>moving uneasily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Stop it! &hellip; time to go when those
thoughts come &hellip; sail on Saturday &hellip; not come here
again &hellip; Nina will soon be fighting Sam for my son's love!
&hellip; I'm better out of that! &hellip; O Christ, what a mess it
all is! &hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>appears in the doorway in rear. He carries a small,
expensive yacht's model of a sloop with the sails set. He is in a
terrific state of conflicting emotions, on the verge of tears yet
stubbornly determined.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I got to do it! &hellip; Gosh, it's
awful &hellip; this boat is so pretty &hellip; why did it have to
come from him? &hellip; I can get Dad to buy me another boat
&hellip; but now I love this one &hellip; but he kissed Mother
&hellip; she kissed him &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He walks up defiantly and confronts Darrell who turns to him
in surprise.</i>) Hey--Darrell--did you--? (<i>He stops
chokingly.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>immediately realizing what is coming--thinking with
somber anguish</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">So this has to happen! &hellip; what I
dreaded! &hellip; my fate is merciless, it seems! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with strained kindliness</i>) Did what?</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>growing hard--stammers angrily</i>) I found
this--out in the hall. It can't be from anybody else. Is this--your
present?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>hard and defiant himself</i>) Yes.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>in a rage--tremblingly</i>) Then--here's what--I
think of you! (<i>Beginning to cry, he breaks off the mast,
bowsprit, breaks the mast in two, tears the rigging off and throws
the dismantled hull at Darrell's feet.</i>) There! You can keep
it!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>his anger overcoming him for an instant</i>)
You--you mean little devil, you! You don't get that from
me--(<i>He</i> <i>has taken a threatening step forward. Gordon
stands white-faced, defying him. Darrell pulls himself up
short--then in a trembling voice of deeply wounded affection</i>)
You shouldn't have done that, son. What difference do I make? It
was never my boat. But it was your boat. You should consider the
boat, not me. Don't you like boats for themselves? It was a
beautiful little boat, I thought. That's why I--</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>sobbing miserably</i>) It was awful pretty! I didn't
want to do it! (<i>He kneels down and gathers up the boat into his
arms again.</i>) Honest I didn't. I love boats! But I hate you!
(<i>this last with passionate intensity</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>dryly</i>) So I've observed. (<i>thinking with
angry anguish</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He hurts, damn him! &hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--No, you don't know! More'n ever now! More'n ever!
(<i>the secret escaping him</i>) I saw you kissing Mother! I saw
Mother, too!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>startled, but immediately forcing a smile</i>) But
I was saying good-bye. We're old friends. You know that.</p>

<p>GORDON--You can't fool me! This was different!
(<i>explosively</i>) It would serve you good and right--and Mother,
too--if I was to tell Dad on you!</p>

<p>DARRELL--Why, I'm Sam's oldest friend. Don't make a little fool
of yourself!</p>

<p>GORDON--You are not his friend. You've always been hanging
around cheating him--hanging around Mother!</p>

<p>DARRELL--Keep still! What do you mean cheating him?</p>

<p>GORDON--I don't know. But I know you aren't his friend. And
sometime I'm going to tell him I saw you--</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with great seriousness now--deeply moved</i>)
Listen! There are things a man of honor doesn't tell anyone--not
even his mother or father. You want to be a man of honor, don't
you? (<i>intensely</i>) There are things we don't tell, you and I!
(<i>He has put his hand around Gordon's shoulder
impulsively.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">This is my son! &hellip; I love him!
&hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking--terribly torn</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why do I like him now? &hellip; I like
him awful! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>crying</i>) We?--who d'you mean?--I've got honor!--more'n
you!--you don't have to tell me!--I wasn't going to tell Dad
anyway, honest I wasn't! We?--what d'you mean, we?--I'm not like
you! I don't want to be ever like you! (<i>There is the sound of a
door being flung open and shut and Evans' hearty voice.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>from the entrance hall</i>) Hello, everybody!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>slapping Gordon on the back</i>) Buck up, son! Here
he is! Hide that boat or he'll ask questions. (<i>Gordon runs and
hides the boat under the sofa. When Evans enters, Gordon is
entirely composed and runs to him joyfully. Evans has grown
stouter, his face is heavy now, he has grown executive and used to
command, he automatically takes charge wherever he is. He does not
look his age except that his hair has grown scanty and there is a
perceptible bald spot on top. He is expensively tailored.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>hugging Gordon to him--lovingly</i>) How's the old
son? How's the birthday coming along?</p>

<p>GORDON--Fine, Dad!</p>

<p>EVANS--Hello, Ned! Isn't this kid of mine a whopper for his age,
though!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>smiling strainedly</i>) Yes.
(<i>writhing--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It hurts now! &hellip; to see my son
his son! &hellip; I've had enough! &hellip; get out! &hellip; any
excuse! &hellip; I can phone afterwards! &hellip; I'll yell out the
whole business if I stay! &hellip;</p>

<p>I was just going, Sam. I've got to step around and see a fellow
who lives near--biologist. (<i>He has gone to the door.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>disappointedly</i>) Then you won't be here for
lunch?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'll yell the truth into your ears if I
stay a second longer &hellip; you damned lunatic! &hellip;</p>

<p>Can't stay. Sorry. This is important. I'm sailing in a few
days--lots to do--see you later, Sam. So long--Gordon.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>as he goes out with awkward haste</i>)
Good-bye--Uncle Ned. (<i>thinking confusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why did I call him that when I said I
never would? &hellip; I know &hellip; must be because he said he's
sailing and I'm glad &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--So long, Ned. (<i>thinking--good-naturedly
superior</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned and his biology! &hellip; He takes
his hobby pretty seriously! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with satisfaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well, he can afford to have hobbies
now! &hellip; his investment with me has made him a pile&hellip; .
Where's Mother, son?</p>

<p>GORDON--Out in the kitchen with Uncle Charlie.
(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hope he never comes back! &hellip;
why did I like him then? &hellip; it was only for a second &hellip;
I didn't really &hellip; I never could! &hellip; why does he always
call me Gordon as if he hated to? &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>sitting down at left</i>) I hope lunch is ready soon.
I'm hungry as the devil, aren't you?</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>absent-mindedly</i>) Yes, Dad.</p>

<p>EVANS--Come over here and tell me about your birthday.
(<i>Gordon comes over. Evans pulls him up on his lap.</i>) How'd
you like your presents? What'd you get from Uncle Ned?</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>evasively</i>) They were all dandy.
(<i>suddenly</i>) Why was I named Gordon?</p>

<p>EVANS--Oh, you know all about that--all about Gordon Shaw. I've
told you time and again.</p>

<p>GORDON--You told me once he was Mother's beau--when she was a
girl.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>teasingly</i>) What do you know about beaus? You're
growing up!</p>

<p>GORDON--Did Mother love him a lot?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>embarrassedly</i>) I guess so.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking keenly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That's why Darrell hates me being
called Gordon &hellip; he knows Mother loved Gordon better'n she
does him &hellip; now I know how to get back at him &hellip; I'll
be just like Gordon was and Mother'll love me better'n him!
&hellip;</p>

<p>And then that Gordon was killed, wasn't he? Am I anything like
him?</p>

<p>EVANS--I hope you are. If when you go to college you can play
football or row like Gordon did, I'll--I'll give you anything you
ask for! I mean that!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>dreamily</i>) Tell me about him again, will you,
Dad--about the time he was stroking the crew and the fellow who was
Number Seven began to crack, and he couldn't see him but he felt
him cracking somehow, and he began talking back to him all the time
and sort of gave him his strength so that when the race was over
and they'd won Gordon fainted and the other fellow didn't.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>with a fond laugh</i>) Why, you know it all by heart!
What's the use of my telling you?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>comes in from the rear while they are talking. She
comes forward slowly. Thinking resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Does he love Sam more than he does me?
&hellip; oh, no, he can't! &hellip; but he trusts him more!
&hellip; he confides in him more! &hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--Did you ever used to fight fellows, Dad?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>embarrassedly</i>) Oh, a little--when I had to.</p>

<p>GORDON--Could you lick Darrell?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>) Why does he ask that?
&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>surprised</i>) Your Uncle Ned? What for? We've always
been friends.</p>

<p>GORDON--I mean, if you weren't friends, could you?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>boastfully</i>) Oh, yes, I guess so. Ned was never as
strong as I was.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking contemptuously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned is weak.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then apprehensively</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But you're getting too strong, Sam.
&hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--But Gordon could have licked you, couldn't he?</p>

<p>EVANS--You bet he could!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She must have loved Gordon better'n Dad
even! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>She comes forward to the chair at center, forcing a
smile.</i>) What's all this talk about fighting? That's not nice.
For heaven's sake, Sam, don't encourage him--</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>grinning</i>) Never mind the women, Gordon. You've
got to know how to fight to get on in this world.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking pityingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">You poor booby! &hellip; how brave you
are now! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>softly</i>) Perhaps you're right, dear. (<i>looking
around</i>) Has Ned gone?</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>defiantly</i>) Yes--and he's not coming back--and
he's sailing soon!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a shudder</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why does he challenge me that way?
&hellip; and cling to Sam? &hellip; he must have seen Ned and me
&hellip; he doesn't offer to come to my lap &hellip; he used to
&hellip; Ned was right&hellip; I've got to lie to him &hellip; get
him back &hellip; here &hellip; on my lap! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a sneer--to Evans</i>) I'm glad Ned's gone. I was
afraid he was going to be on our hands all day.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>eagerly, half-getting down from his father's
lap</i>) You're glad--? (<i>then cautiously thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's cheating &hellip; I saw her kiss
him.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--Ned's getting to be an awful bore. He's so weak. He can't
get started on anything unless he's pushed.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>moving a little nearer--searching her
face--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She doesn't seem to like him so much
&hellip; but I saw her kiss him! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>surprised</i>) Oh, come now, Nina, aren't you being a
little hard on Ned? It's true he's sort of lost his grip in a way
but he's our best friend.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>moving away from his father
again--resentfully--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's Dad standing up for him to her
for? &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking triumphantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That's right, Sam &hellip; just what I
wanted you to say! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>boredly</i>) Oh, I know he is but he gets on my nerves
hanging around all the time. Without being too rude, I urged him to
get back to his work, and made him promise me he wouldn't return
for two years. Finally he promised--and then he became silly and
sentimental and asked me to kiss him goodbye for good luck! So I
kissed him to get rid of him! The silly fool!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking--overjoyed</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Then! &hellip; that's why! &hellip;
that's why! &hellip; and he'll be gone two years! &hellip; oh, I'm
so glad! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He goes to her and looks up into her face with shining
eyes.</i>) Mother!</p>

<p>NINA--Dear! (<i>She takes him up on her lap and hugs him in her
arms.</i>)</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>kisses her</i>) There! (<i>triumphantly
thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That makes up for his kiss! &hellip;
That takes it off her mouth.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>grinning</i>) Ned must be falling for you--in his old
age! (<i>then sentimentally</i>) Poor guy! He's never married,
that's the trouble. He's lonely. I know how he feels. A fellow
needs a little feminine encouragement to help him keep his head
up.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>snuggling Gordon's head against hers--laughing
teasingly</i>) I think your hard-headed Dad is getting mushy and
silly! What do you think, Gordon?</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>laughing with her</i>) Yes, he's mushy, Mother! He's
silly! (<i>He kisses her and whispers</i>) I'm going to be like
Gordon Shaw, Mother! (<i>She hugs him fiercely to her, triumphantly
happy.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>grinning</i>) You two are getting too hard-boiled for
me. (<i>He laughs. They all laugh happily together.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>suddenly overcome by a wave of conscience-stricken
remorse and pity</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, I am hard on Ned! &hellip; poor
dear generous Ned! &hellip; you told me to lie to your son against
you &hellip; for my sake &hellip; I'm not worthy of your love!
&hellip; I'm low and selfish! &hellip; but I do love you! &hellip;
this is the son of our love in my arms! &hellip; oh, Mother God,
grant my prayer that some day we may tell our son the truth and he
may love his father! &hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>sensing her thoughts, sits up in her lap and stares
into her face, while she guiltily avoids his eyes--in fear and
resentment. Thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's thinking about that Darrell now!
&hellip; I know! &hellip; she likes him too! &hellip; she can't
fool me! &hellip; I saw her kissing! &hellip; she didn't think he
was a silly fool then! &hellip; she was lying to Dad and me!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He pushes off her lap and backs away from her.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He read my thoughts! &hellip; I mustn't
even think of Ned when he's around! &hellip; poor Ned! &hellip; no,
don't think of him! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>leaning forward toward Gordon with her arms stretched out
entreatingly but adopting a playful tone</i>) Why, Gordon, what's
come over you? You jumped off my lap as though you'd sat on a tack!
(<i>She forces a laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>his eyes on the floor--evasively</i>) I'm hungry. I
want to see if lunch is nearly ready. (<i>He turns abruptly and
runs out.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>in a tone of superior manly understanding, kindly but
laying down the law to womanly weakness</i>) He's sick of being
babied, Nina. You forget he's getting to be a big boy. And we want
him to grow up a real he-man and not an old lady like Charlie.
(<i>sagaciously</i>) That's what's made Charlie like he is, I'll
bet. His mother never stopped babying him.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>submissively--but with a look of bitter scorn at
him</i>) Perhaps you're right, Sam.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>confidently</i>) I know I am!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with a look of intense hatred</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, Mother God, grant that I may some
day tell this fool the truth! &hellip;</p>

<p align="center">(<i>Curtain</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a08" id="a08">ACT EIGHT</a>
</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>Late afternoon in late June, ten years later--the
afterdeck of the Evans' motor cruiser anchored in the lane of
yachts near the finish line at Poughkeepsie. The bow and amidship
of the cruiser are off right, pointed upstream. The portside rail
is in the rear, the curve of the stern at left, the rear of the
cabin with broad windows and a door is at right. Two wicker chairs
are at left and a chaise longue at right. A wicker table with
another chair is at center. The afterdeck is in cool shade,
contrasted with the soft golden haze of late afternoon sunlight
that glows on the river.</i></p>

<p><i>Nina is sitting by the table at center, Darrell in the chair
farthest left, Marsden in the chaise longue at right. Evans is
leaning over the rail directly back of Nina, looking up the river
through a pair of binoculars. Madeline Arnold is standing by his
side.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Nina's hair has turned completely white. She is desperately
trying to conceal the obvious inroads of time by an over-emphasis
on make-up that defeats its end by drawing attention to what it
would conceal. Her face is thin, her cheeks taut, her mouth drawn
with forced smiling. There is little left of her face's charm
except her eyes which now seem larger and more deeply mysterious
than ever. But she has kept her beautiful figure. It has the tragic
effect of making her face seem older and more worn-out by contrast.
Her general manner recalls instantly the Nina of Act Four,
neurotic, passionately embittered and torn. She is dressed in a
white yachting costume.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Darrell seems to have "thrown back" to the young doctor we
had seen at the house of Nina's father in Act Two. He has again the
air of the cool, detached scientist regarding himself and the
people around him as interesting phenomena. In appearance, he is
once more sharply defined, his face and body have grown lean and
well-conditioned, the puffiness and jowls of the previous Act are
gone. His skin is tanned almost black by his years in the tropics.
His thick hair is iron-gray. He wears flannel pants, a blue coat,
white buckskin shoes. He looks his fifty-one years, perhaps, but
not a day more. Marsden has aged greatly. The stoop of his tall
figure is accentuated, his hair has grown whitish. He is an older
image of the Marsden of Act Five, who was so prostrated by his</i>
<i>mother's death. Now it is his sister's death two months before
that has plunged him into despair. His present grief, however, is
more resigned to its fate than the old. He is dressed immaculately
in black, as in Act Five.</i></p>

<p><i>Evans is simply Evans, his type logically developed by ten
years of continued success and accumulating wealth, jovial and
simple and good-natured as ever, but increasingly stubborn and
self-opinionated. He has grown very stout. His jowly broad face has
a heavy, flushed, apoplectic look. His head has grown quite bald on
top. He is wearing a yachting cap, blue yachting coat, white
flannel pants, buckskin shoes.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Madeline Arnold is a pretty girl of nineteen, with dark hair
and eyes. Her skin is deeply tanned, her figure tall and athletic,
reminding one of Nina's when we first saw her. Her personality is
direct and frank. She gives the impression of a person who always
knows exactly what she is after and generally gets it, but is also
generous and a good loser, a good sport who is popular with her own
sex as well as sought after by men. She is dressed in a
bright-colored sport costume.</i>
</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>nervous and excited--on pins and needles--lowering
his binoculars impatiently</i>) Can't see anything up there!
There's a damned haze on the river! (<i>handing the binoculars to
Madeline</i>) Here, Madeline. You've got young eyes.</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>eagerly</i>) Thank you. (<i>She looks up the river
through the glasses.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Young eyes! &hellip; they look into
Gordon's eyes! &hellip; he sees love in her young eyes! &hellip;
mine are old now! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>pulling out his watch</i>) Soon be time for the
start. (<i>comes forward--exasperatedly</i>) Of course, the damned
radio has to pick out this time to go dead! Brand new one I had
installed especially for this race, too! Just my luck! (<i>coming
to Nina and putting his hand on her shoulder</i>) Gosh, I'll bet
Gordon's some keyed-up right at this moment, Nina!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>without lowering the glasses</i>) Poor kid! I'll
bet he is!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with intense bitterness</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That tone in her voice! &hellip; her
love already possesses him! &hellip; my son! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>vindictively</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But she won't! &hellip; as long as I
live! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>flatly</i>) Yes, he must be nervous.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>taking his hand away, sharply</i>) I didn't mean
nervous. He doesn't know what it is to have nerves. Nothing's ever
got him rattled yet. (<i>this last with a resentful look down
at</i> <i>her as he moves back to the rail</i>)</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>with the calm confidence of one who knows</i>)
Yes, you can bank on Gordon never losing his nerve.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>coldly</i>) I'm quite aware my son isn't a
weakling--(<i>meaningly, with a glance at Madeline</i>) even though
he does do weak things sometimes.</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>without lowering the glasses from her
eyes--thinking good-naturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ouch! &hellip; that was meant for me!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then hurt</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why does she dislike me so? &hellip;
I've done my best, for Gordon's sake, to be nice to her&hellip;
.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>looking back at Nina resentfully--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Another nasty crack at Madeline!
&hellip; Nina's certainly become the prize bum sport! &hellip; I
thought once her change of life was over she'd be ashamed of her
crazy jealousy &hellip; instead of that it's got worse &hellip; but
I'm not going to let her come between Gordon and Madeline &hellip;
he loves her and she loves him &hellip; and her folks have got
money and position, too &hellip; and I like her a lot &hellip; and,
by God, I'm going to see to it their marriage goes through on
schedule, no matter how much Nina kicks up! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>keenly observant--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Nina hates this young lady &hellip; of
course! &hellip; Gordon's girl &hellip; she'll smash their
engagement if she can &hellip; as she did mine once &hellip; once!
&hellip; thank God my slavery is over! &hellip; how did she know I
was back in town? &hellip; I wasn't going to see her again &hellip;
but her invitation was so imploring &hellip; my duty to Gordon, she
wrote &hellip; what duty? &hellip; pretty late in the day! &hellip;
that's better left dead, too! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>looking at his watch again</i>) They ought to be
lined up at the start any minute now. (<i>pounding his fist on the
rail--letting his pent-up feelings explode</i>) Come on,
Gordon!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>startled--with nervous irritation</i>) Sam! I told you
I have a splitting headache! (<i>thinking intensely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">You vulgar boor! &hellip; Gordon's
engagement to her is all your fault! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>resentfully</i>) I'm sorry. Why don't you take some
aspirin? (<i>thinking irritably</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Nina in the dumps! &hellip; Charlie in
mourning! &hellip; what a pair of killjoys! &hellip; I wanted to
bring Gordon and his friends on board to celebrate &hellip; no
chance! &hellip; have to take Madeline &hellip; stage a party in
New York &hellip; leave this outfit flat &hellip; Nina'll be sore
as the devil but she'll have to like it &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>examining Nina critically--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's gotten into a fine neurotic state
&hellip; reminds me of when I first knew her &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then exultantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Thank God, I can watch her objectively
again &hellip; these last three years away have finally done it
&hellip; complete cure! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then remorsefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor Nina! &hellip; we're all deserting
her &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then glancing at Marsden--with a trace of a sneer</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Even Marsden seems to have left her for
the dead! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>vaguely irritated--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What am I doing here? &hellip; what do
I care about this stupid race? &hellip; why did I let Nina bully me
into coming? &hellip; I ought to be alone &hellip; with my memories
of dear Jane &hellip; it will be two months ago Saturday she died
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>His lips tremble, tears come to his eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>with an impatient sigh, lowering the glasses</i>)
It's no use, Mr. Evans, I can't see a thing.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>with angry disgust</i>) If only that damned radio was
working!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>exasperatedly</i>) For heaven's sake, stop swearing so
much!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>hurt--indignantly</i>) What about it if I am excited?
Seems to me you could show a little more interest without it
hurting you, when it's Gordon's last race, his last appearance on a
varsity! (<i>He turns away from her.</i>)</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's right &hellip; she's acting rotten
&hellip; if I were Gordon's mother, I certainly wouldn't
&hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>turning back to Nina--resentfully</i>) You used to
cheer loud enough for Gordon Shaw! And our Gordon's got him beat a
mile, as an oarsman, at least! (<i>turning to Darrell</i>) And that
isn't father stuff either, Ned! All the experts say so!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>cynically</i>) Oh, come on, Sam! Surely no one
could ever touch Shaw in anything! (<i>He glances at Nina with a
sneer. Immediately angry at himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What an idiot! &hellip; that popped out
of me! &hellip; old habit! &hellip; I haven't loved her in years!
&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking indifferently</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ned still feels jealous &hellip; that
no longer pleases me &hellip; I don't feel anything &hellip; except
that I must get him to help me.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She turns to Darrell bitterly.</i>) Sam said "our" Gordon.
He means his. Gordon's become so like Sam, Ned, you won't recognize
him!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>thinking indignantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She's crazy! &hellip; he's nothing like
his father! &hellip; he's so strong and handsome! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>good-naturedly, with a trace of pride</i>) You
flatter me, Nina. I wish I thought that. But he isn't a bit like
me, luckily for him. He's a dead ringer for Gordon Shaw at his
best.</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Shaw &hellip; I've seen his picture in
the gym &hellip; my Gordon is better looking &hellip; he once told
me Shaw was an old beau of his mother's &hellip; they say she was
beautiful once &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>shaking her head--scornfully</i>) Don't be modest,
Sam. Gordon <i>is</i> you. He may be a fine athlete like Gordon
Shaw, because you've held that out to him as your ideal, but there
the resemblance ceases. He isn't really like him at all, not the
slightest bit!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>restraining his anger with
difficulty--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'm getting sick of this! &hellip;
she's carrying her jealous grouch too far! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>suddenly exploding, pounds his fist on the rail</i>) Damn
it, Nina, if you had any feeling you couldn't--right at the moment
when he's probably getting into the shell--(<i>He stops, trying to
control himself, panting, his face red.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>staring at him with repulsion--with cool disdain</i>)
I didn't say anything so dire, did I--merely that Gordon resembles
you in character. (<i>with malice</i>) Don't get so excited. It's
bad for your high blood pressure. Ask Ned if it isn't.
(<i>intensely--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">If he'd only die! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>thinking--immediately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, I don't mean that &hellip; I
mustn't &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking keenly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There's a death wish &hellip; things
have gone pretty far &hellip; Sam does look as if he might have a
bad pressure &hellip; what hope that would have given me at one
time! &hellip; no more, thank God! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>in a joking tone</i>) Oh, I guess Sam's all right, Nina.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>gruffly</i>) I never felt better. (<i>He jerks out
his watch again.</i>) Time for the start. Come on in the cabin,
Ned, and shoot a drink. We'll see if McCabe's getting the damned
radio fixed. (<i>Passing by Marsden he claps him on the shoulder
exasperatedly.</i>) Come on, Charlie! Snap out of it!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>startled out of his trance--bewilderedly</i>)
Eh?--what is it?--are they coming?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>recovering his good nature--with a grin, taking his
arm</i>) You're coming to shoot a drink. You need about ten, I
think, to get you in the right spirit to see the finish! (<i>to
Darrell who has gotten up but is still standing by his chair</i>)
Come on, Ned.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>quickly</i>) No, leave Ned with me. I want to talk to
him. Take Madeline--and Charlie.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looking at her appealingly</i>) But I'm perfectly
contented sitting--(<i>then after a look in her
eyes--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She wants to be alone with Darrell
&hellip; all right &hellip; doesn't matter now &hellip; their love
is dead &hellip; but there's still some secret between them she's
never told me &hellip; never mind &hellip; she'll tell me sometime
&hellip; I'm all she will have left &hellip; soon. &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then stricken with guilt</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor dear Jane! &hellip; how can I
think of anyone but you! &hellip; God, I'm contemptible! &hellip;
I'll get drunk with that fool! &hellip; that's all I'm good for!
&hellip;</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>thinking resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She takes a fine do-this-little-girl
tone toward me! &hellip; I'll give in to her now &hellip; but once
I'm married! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--Come on then, Madeline. We'll give you a small one.
(<i>impatiently</i>) Charlie! Head up!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with hectic joviality</i>) I hope it's strong
poison!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>laughing</i>) That's the spirit! We'll make a sport
out of you yet!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>laughing, goes and takes Marsden's arm</i>) I'll
see you get home safe, Mr. Marsden! (<i>They go into the cabin,
Evans following them. Nina and Darrell turn and look at each other
wonderingly, inquisitively, for a long moment. Darrell remains
standing and seems to be a little uneasy.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking with melancholy interest</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">And now? &hellip; what? &hellip; I can
look into her eyes &hellip; strange eyes that will never grow old
&hellip; without desire or jealousy or bitterness &hellip; was she
ever my mistress? &hellip; can she be the mother of my child?
&hellip; is there such a person as my son? &hellip; I can't think
of these things as real any more &hellip; they must have happened
in another life.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking sadly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">My old lover &hellip; how well and
young he looks &hellip; now we no longer love each other at all
&hellip; our account with God the Father is settled &hellip;
afternoons of happiness paid for with years of pain &hellip; love,
passion, ecstasy &hellip; in what a far-off life were they alive!
&hellip; the only living life is in the past and future &hellip;
the present is an interlude &hellip; strange interlude in which we
call on past and future to bear witness we are living! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a sad smile</i>) Sit down, Ned. When I heard you were
back I wrote you because I need a friend. It has been so long since
we loved each other we can now be friends again. Don't you feel
that?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>gratefully</i>) Yes. I do. (<i>He sits down in one
of the chairs at left, drawing it up closer to her. Thinking
cautiously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I want to be her friend &hellip; but I
will never &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking cautiously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must keep very cool and sensible or
he won't help me.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a friendly smile</i>) I haven't seen you look so young
and handsome since I first knew you. Tell me your secret.
(<i>bitterly</i>) I need it! I'm old! Look at me! And I was
actually looking forward to being old! I thought it would mean
peace. I've been sadly disillusioned! (<i>then forcing a smile</i>)
So tell me what fountain of youth you've found.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>proudly</i>) That's easy. Work! I've become as
interested in biology as I once was in medicine. And not selfishly
interested, that's the difference. There's no chance of my becoming
a famous biologist and I know it. I'm very much a worker in the
ranks. But our Station is a "huge success," as Sam would say. We've
made some damned important discoveries. I say "we." I really mean
Preston. You may remember I used to write you about him with
enthusiasm. He's justified it. He <i>is</i> making his name
world-famous. He's what I might have been--I did have the brains,
Nina!--if I'd had more guts and less vanity, if I'd hewn to the
line! (<i>then forcing a smile</i>) But I'm not lamenting. I've
found myself in helping him. In that way I feel I've paid my
debt--that his work is partly my work. And he acknowledges it. He
possesses the rare virtue of gratitude. (<i>with proud
affection</i>) He's a fine boy, Nina! I suppose I should say man
now he's in his thirties.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with bitter sorrow</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">So, Ned &hellip; you remember our love
&hellip; with bitterness! &hellip; as a stupid mistake! &hellip;
the proof of a gutless vanity that ruined your career! &hellip; oh!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then controlling herself--thinking cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well, after all, how do I remember our
love? &hellip; with no emotion at all, not even bitterness!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with sudden alarm</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's forgotten Gordon for this Preston!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>thinking desperately</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must make him remember Gordon is his
child or I can never persuade him to help me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>reproachfully</i>) So you have found a son while I was
losing mine--who is yours, too!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>struck by this--impersonally interested</i>) That's
never occurred to me but now I think of it--(<i>smiling</i>) Yes,
perhaps unconsciously Preston is a compensating substitute. Well,
it's done both of us good and hasn't harmed anyone.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with bitter emphasis</i>) Except your real son--and
me--but we don't count, I suppose!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>coolly</i>) Harmed Gordon? How? He's all right,
isn't he? (<i>with a sneer</i>) I should say from all I've been
hearing that he was your ideal of college hero--like his
never-to-be-forgotten namesake!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's sneering at his own son!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then trying to be calculating</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I mustn't get angry &hellip; I must
make him help me.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>speaking with gentle reproach</i>) And am I the ideal of a
happy mother, Ned?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>immediately moved by pity and ashamed of
himself</i>) Forgive me, Nina. I haven't quite buried all my
bitterness, I'm afraid. (<i>gently</i>) I'm sorry you're unhappy,
Nina.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking with satisfaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He means that &hellip; he still does
care a little &hellip; if only it's enough to &hellip; !</p>

<p>(<i>speaking sadly</i>) I've lost my son, Ned! Sam has made him
all his. And it was done so gradually that, although I realized
what was happening, there was never any way I could interfere. What
Sam advised seemed always the best thing for Gordon's future. And
it was always what Gordon himself wanted, to escape from me to
boarding school and then to college, to become Sam's athletic
hero--</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>impatiently</i>) Oh, come now, Nina, you know
you've always longed for him to be like Gordon Shaw!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>bursting out in spite of herself--violently</i>) He's
not like Gordon! He's forgotten me for that--! (<i>trying to be
more reasonable</i>) What do I care whether he's an athlete or not?
It's such nonsense, all this fuss! I'm not the slightest bit
interested in this race today, for example! I wouldn't care if he
came in last! (<i>stopping herself--thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, if he should ever guess I said
that! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking keenly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Hello! &hellip; she said that as if
she'd like to see him come last! &hellip; why? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then vindictively</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well, so would I! &hellip; it's time
these Gordons took a good licking from life! &hellip;</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>suddenly appears in the door from the cabin, her
face flushed with excitement</i>) They're off! Mr. Evans is getting
something--it's terribly faint but--Navy and Washington are
leading--Gordon's third! (<i>She disappears back in the
cabin.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>looking after her with hatred</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Her Gordon! &hellip; she is so sure!
&hellip; how I've come to detest her pretty face! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking with a sneer</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">"Gordon's third"! &hellip; you might
think there was no one else pulling the shell! &hellip; what idiots
women make of themselves about these Gordons! &hellip; she's
pretty, that Madeline! &hellip; she's got a figure like Nina's when
I first loved her &hellip; those afternoons &hellip; age is
beginning to tell on Nina's face &hellip; but she's kept her
wonderful body! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a trace of malice--dryly</i>) There's a young lady who
seems to care a lot whether Gordon comes in last or not!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>trying to be sorrowful and appealing</i>) Yes. Gordon
is hers now, Ned. (<i>But she cannot bear this
thought--vindictively</i>) That is, they're engaged. But, of
course, that doesn't necessarily mean--Can you imagine him throwing
himself away on a little fool like that? I simply can't believe he
really loves her! Why, she's hardly even pretty and she's deadly
stupid. I thought he was only flirting with her--or merely
indulging in a passing physical affair. (<i>She winces.</i>) At his
age, one has to expect--even a mother must face nature. But for
Gordon to take her seriously, and propose marriage--it's too
idiotic for words!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking cynically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, so you'll compromise on his
sleeping with her&hellip; if you have to &hellip; but she must have
no real claim to dispute your ownership, eh? &hellip; you'd like to
make her the same sort of convenient slave for him that I was for
you! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>resentfully</i>) I can't agree with you. I find her quite
charming. It seems to me if I were in Gordon's shoes I'd do exactly
what he has done.</p>

<p>(<i>in confusion--thinking bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">In Gordon's shoes! &hellip; I always
was in Gordon Shaw's shoes! &hellip; and why am I taking this young
Gordon's part? &hellip; what is he to me, for God's sake?
&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>unheedingly</i>) If he marries her, it means he'll
forget me! He'll forget me as completely as Sam forgot his mother!
She'll keep him away from me! Oh, I know what wives can do! She'll
use her body until she persuades him to forget me! My son, Ned! And
your son, too! (<i>She suddenly gets up and goes to him and takes
one of his hands in both of hers.</i>) The son of our old love,
Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking with a strange shudder of mingled
attraction and fear as she touches him</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Our love &hellip; old love &hellip; old
touch of her flesh &hellip; we're old &hellip; it's silly and
indecent &hellip; does she think she still can own me? &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in the tone a mother takes in speaking to her husband
about their boy</i>) You'll have to give Gordon a good talking to,
Ned.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>still more disturbed--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Old &hellip; but she's kept her
wonderful body &hellip; how many years since? &hellip; she has the
same strange influence over me &hellip; touch of her flesh
&hellip;it's dangerous &hellip; bosh, I'm only humoring her as a
friend &hellip; as her doctor &hellip; and why shouldn't I have a
talk with Gordon? &hellip; a father owes something to his son
&hellip; he ought to advise him.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then alarmed</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I was never going to meddle again
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>sternly</i>) I swore I'd never again meddle with human
lives, Nina!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>unheedingly</i>) You must keep him from ruining his
life.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>doggedly--struggling with himself</i>) I won't
touch a life that has more than one cell! (<i>harshly</i>) And I
wouldn't help you in this, anyway! You've got to give up owning
people, meddling in their lives as if you were God and had created
them!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>strangely forlorn</i>) I don't know what you mean,
Ned. Gordon is my son, isn't he?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with a sudden strange violence</i>) And mine! Mine,
too! (<i>He stops himself. Thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Shut up, you fool! &hellip; is that the
way to humor her? &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with strange quiet</i>) I think I still love you a
little, Ned.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>in her tone</i>) And I still love you a little,
Nina. (<i>then sternly</i>) But I will not meddle in your life
again! (<i>with a harsh laugh</i>) And you've meddled enough with
human love, old lady! Your time for that is over! I'll send you a
couple of million cells you can torture without harming yourself!
(<i>regaining control--shamefacedly</i>) Nina! Please forgive
me!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>starts as if out of a dream--anxiously</i>) What were
you saying, Ned? (<i>She lets go of his hand and goes back to her
chair.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>dully</i>) Nothing.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>strangely</i>) We were talking about Sam, weren't we?
How do you think he looks?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>confusedly casual</i>) Fine. A bit too fat, of
course. He looks as though his blood pressure might be higher than
it ought to be. But that's not unusual in persons of his build and
age. It's nothing to hope--I meant, to worry over! (<i>then
violently</i>) God damn it, why did you make me say hope?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>calmly</i>) It may have been in your mind, too, mayn't
it?</p>

<p>DARRELL--No! I've nothing against Sam. I've always been his best
friend. He owes his happiness to me.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>strangely</i>) There are so many curious reasons we
dare not think about for thinking things!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>rudely</i>) Thinking doesn't matter a damn! Life is
something in one cell that doesn't need to think!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>strangely</i>) I know! God the Mother!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>excitedly</i>) And all the rest is gutless egotism!
But to hell with it! What I started to say was, what possible
reason could I have for hoping for Sam's death?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>strangely</i>) We're always desiring death for
ourselves or others, aren't we--while we while away our lives with
the old surface ritual of coveting our neighbor's ass?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>frightenedly</i>) You're talking like the old Nina
now--when I first loved you. Please don't! It isn't decent--at our
age! (<i>thinking in terror</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The old Nina! &hellip; am I the old
Ned? &hellip; then that means? &hellip; but we must not meddle in
each other's lives again! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>strangely</i>) I am the old Nina! And this time I will
not let my Gordon go from me forever!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>appears in the doorway of the cabin--excited and
irritated</i>) Madeline's listening in now. It went dead on me.
(<i>Raising the binoculars as he goes to the rail, he looks up the
river.</i>) Last I got, Gordon third, Navy and Washington leading.
They're the ones to fear, he said--Navy especially. (<i>putting
down the glasses--with a groan</i>) Damned haze! My eyes are
getting old. (<i>then suddenly with a grin</i>) You ought to see
Charlie! He started throwing Scotch into him as if he were drinking
against time. I had to take the bottle away from him. It's hit him
an awful wallop. (<i>then looking from one to the
other--resentfully</i>) What's the matter with you two? There's a
race going on, don't you know it? And you sit like dead clams!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>placatingly</i>) I thought someone'd better stay
out here and let you know when they get in sight.</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>relieved</i>) Oh, sure, that's right! Here, take the
glasses. You always had good eyes. (<i>Darrell gets up and takes
the glasses and goes to the rail and begins adjusting
them.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--Which crew was it you said Gordon feared the most?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>has gone back to the cabin doorway</i>) Navy.
(<i>then proudly</i>) Oh, he'll beat them! But it'll be damn close.
I'll see if Madeline's getting--(<i>He goes back in the
cabin.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>looking up the river--with vindictive
bitterness--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Come on, Navy! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Madeline's Gordon! &hellip; Sam's
Gordon! &hellip; the thanks I get for saving Sam at the sacrifice
of my own happiness! &hellip; I won't have it! &hellip; what do I
care what happens to Sam now? &hellip; I hate him! &hellip; I'll
tell him Gordon isn't his child! &hellip; and threaten to tell
Gordon too, unless! &hellip; he'll be in deadly fear of that!
&hellip; he'll soon find some excuse to break their engagement!
&hellip; he can! &hellip; he has the strangest influence over
Gordon! &hellip; but Ned must back me up or Sam won't believe me!
&hellip; Ned must tell him too! &hellip; but will Ned? &hellip;
he'll be afraid of the insanity! &hellip; I must make him believe
Sam's in no danger &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>intensely</i>) Listen, Ned, I'm absolutely sure, from things
she wrote me before she died, that Sam's mother must have been
deliberately lying to me about the insanity that time. She was
jealous because Sam loved me and she simply wanted to be revenged,
I'm sure.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>without lowering glasses--dryly</i>) No. She told
you the truth. I never mentioned it, but I went up there once and
made a thorough investigation of his family.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with resentful disappointment</i>) Oh--I suppose you
wanted to make sure so you could hope he'd go insane?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>simply</i>) I needed to be able to hope that, then.
I loved you horribly at that time, Nina--horribly!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>putting her hands on his arm</i>) And you don't--any
more, Ned? (<i>thinking intensely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, I must make him love me again
&hellip; enough to make him tell Sam! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking strangely--struggling with
himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She'd like to own me again &hellip; I
wish she wouldn't touch me &hellip; what is this tie of old
happiness between our flesh? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>harshly--weakly struggling to shake off her hands, without
lowering the glasses</i>) I won't meddle again with human lives, I
told you!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>unheeding, clinging to him</i>) And I loved you
horribly! I still do love you, Ned! I used to hope he'd go insane
myself because I loved you so! But look at Sam! He's sane as a pig!
There's absolutely no danger now!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking--alarmed</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What is she after now--what does she
want me for? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>stiffly</i>) I'm no longer a doctor but I should say he's a
healthy miss of Nature's. It's a thousand to one against it at this
late day.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with sudden fierce intensity</i>) Then it's time to
tell him the truth, isn't it? We've suffered all our lives for his
sake! We've made him rich and happy! It's time he gave us back our
son!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Aha &hellip; so that's it! &hellip;
tell Sam the truth? &hellip; at last! &hellip; by God, I'd like to
tell him, at that! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a sneer</i>) Our son? You mean yours, my dear! Kindly
count me out of any further meddling with--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>unruffledly--obsessed</i>) But Sam won't believe me if
I'm the only one to tell him! He'll think I'm lying for spite, that
it's only my crazy jealousy! He'll ask you! You've got to tell him
too, Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'd like to see his face when I told
him this famous oarsman isn't his son but mine! &hellip; that might
pay me back a little for all he's taken from me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>harshly</i>) I've stopped meddling in Sam's life, I tell
you!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>insistently</i>) Think of what Sam has made us go
through, of how he's made us suffer! You've got to tell him! You
still love me a little, don't you, Ned? You must when you remember
the happiness we've known in each other's arms! You were the only
happiness I've ever known in life!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>struggling weakly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She lies! &hellip; there was her old
lover, Gordon! &hellip; he was always first! &hellip; then her son,
Gordon! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with desperate rancor--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Come on, Navy! &hellip; beat her
Gordons for me! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>intensely</i>) Oh, if I'd only gone away with you that
time when you came back from Europe! How happy we would have been,
dear! How our boy would have loved you--if it hadn't been for
Sam!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking--weakly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Yes, if it hadn't been for Sam I would
have been happy! &hellip; I would have been the world's greatest
neurologist! &hellip; my boy would have loved me and I'd have loved
him! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a crowning intensity to break down his last
resistance</i>) You must tell him, Ned! For my sake! Because I love
you! Because you remember our afternoons--our mad happiness!
Because you love me!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>beaten--dazedly</i>) Yes--what must I do?--meddle
again? (<i>The noise of Madeline's excited voice cheering and
clapping her hands, of Marsden's voice yelling drunkenly, of
Evans', all shouting</i> "Gordon! Gordon! Come on, Gordon!"
<i>comes from the cabin. Marsden appears swaying in the cabin
doorway yelling</i> "Gordon!" <i>He is hectically tipsy. Darrell
gives a violent shudder as if he were coming out of a nightmare and
pushes Nina away from him.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking--dazedly still, but in a tone of
relief</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Marsden again! &hellip; thank God!
&hellip; he's saved me! &hellip; from her! &hellip; and her
Gordons! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>turning on her triumphantly</i>) No, Nina--sorry--but I
can't help you. I told you I'd never meddle again with human lives!
(<i>more and more confidently</i>) Besides, I'm quite sure Gordon
isn't my son, if the real deep core of the truth were known! I was
only a body to you. Your first Gordon used to come back to life. I
was never more to you than a substitute for your dead lover! Gordon
is really Gordon's son! So you see I'd be telling Sam a lie if I
boasted that I--And I'm a man of honor! I've proved that, at least!
(<i>He raises his glasses and looks up the river. Thinking
exultantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'm free! &hellip; I've beaten her at
last! &hellip; now come on, Navy! &hellip; you've got to beat her
Gordons for me! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>after staring at him for a moment--walking away from
him--thinking with a dull fatalism</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I've lost him &hellip; he'll never tell
Sam now &hellip; is what he said right? &hellip; is Gordon
Gordon's? &hellip; oh, I hope so! &hellip; oh, dear, dead Gordon,
help me to get back your son! &hellip; I must find some way.
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She sits down again.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>who has been staring at them with a foolish
grin</i>) Hello, you two! Why do you look so guilty? You don't love
each other any more! It's all nonsense! I don't feel the slightest
twinge of jealousy. That's proof enough, isn't it? (<i>then blandly
apologetic</i>) Pardon me if I sound a bit pipped--a good bit! Sam
said ten and then took the bottle away when I'd had only five! But
it's enough! I've forgotten sorrow! There's nothing in life worth
grieving about, I assure you, Nina! And I've gotten interested in
this race now. (<i>He sings raucously</i>) "Oh we'll row, row, row,
right down the river! And we'll row, row, row--" Remember that old
tune--when you were a little girl, Nina? Oh, I'm forgetting Sam
said to tell you Gordon was on even terms with the leaders! A
gallant spurt did it! Nip and tuck now! I don't care who wins--as
long as it isn't Gordon! I don't like him since he's grown up! He
thinks I'm an old woman! (<i>sings</i>) "Row, row, row." The field
against Gordon!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>hectically</i>) Right! (<i>He looks through the
glasses--excitedly</i>) I see a flashing in the water way up there!
Must be their oars! They're coming! I'll tell Sam! (<i>He hurries
into the cabin.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking dully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He'll tell Sam &hellip; no, he doesn't
mean that &hellip; I must find some other way &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>walks a bit uncertainly to Nina's chair</i>) Gordon
really should get beaten today--for the good of his soul, Nina.
That Madeline is pretty, isn't she? These Gordons are too
infernally lucky--while we others--(<i>he almost starts to
blubber--angrily</i>) we others have got to beat him today! (<i>He
slumps clumsily down to a sitting position on the deck by her chair
and takes her hand and pats it.</i>) There, there, Nina Cara Nina!
Don't worry your pretty head! It will all come out all right! We'll
only have a little while longer to wait and then you and I'll be
quietly married! (<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The devil! &hellip; what am I saying?
&hellip; I'm drunk! &hellip; all right, all the better! &hellip;
I've wanted all my life to tell her! &hellip;</p>

<p>Of course, I realize you've got a husband at present but, never
mind, I can wait. I've waited a lifetime already; but for a long
while now I've had a keen psychic intuition that I wasn't born to
die before--(<i>Evans and Madeline and Darrell come rushing</i>
<i>out of the cabin. They all have binoculars. They run to the rail
and train their glasses up the river.</i>)</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>excitedly</i>) I see them! (<i>grabbing his arm
and pointing</i>) Look, Mr. Evans--there--don't you see?</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>excitedly</i>) No--not yet--Yes! Now I see them!
(<i>pounding on the rail</i>) Come on, Gordon boy!</p>

<p>MADELINE--Come on, Gordon! (<i>The whistles and sirens from the
yachts up the river begin to be heard. This grows momentarily
louder as one after another other yachts join in the chorus as the
crews approach nearer and nearer until toward the close of the
scene there is a perfect pandemonium of sound.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with bitter hatred--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How I hate her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then suddenly with a deadly calculation--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why not tell her? &hellip; as Sam's
mother told me? &hellip; of the insanity? &hellip; she thinks
Gordon is Sam's son.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a deadly smile of triumph</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That will be poetic justice! &hellip;
that will solve everything! &hellip; she won't marry him! &hellip;
he will turn to me for comfort! &hellip; but I must plan it out
carefully! &hellip;</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>driven on--extravagantly</i>) Listen, Nina! After
we're married I'm going to write a novel--my first real novel! All
the twenty odd books I've written have been long-winded fairy tales
for grown-ups--about dear old ladies and witty, cynical bachelors
and quaint characters with dialects, and married folk who always
admire and respect each other, and lovers who avoid love in hushed
whispers! That's what I've been, Nina--a hush-hush whisperer of
lies! Now I'm going to give an honest healthy yell--turn on the sun
into the shadows of lies--shout "This is life and this is sex, and
here are passion and hatred and regret and joy and pain and
ecstasy, and these are men and women and sons and daughters whose
hearts are weak and strong, whose blood is blood and not a soothing
syrup!" Oh, I can do it, Nina! I can write the truth! I've seen it
in you, your father, my mother, sister, Gordon, Sam, Darrell and
myself. I'll write the book of us! But here I am talking while my
last chapters are in the making--right here and
now--(<i>hurriedly</i>) You'll excuse me, won't you, Nina? I must
watch--my duty as an artist! (<i>He scrambles to his feet and peers
about him with a hectic eagerness. Nina pays no attention to
him.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>exasperatedly, taking down his glasses</i>) You can't
tell a damn thing--which is which or who's ahead--I'm going to
listen in again. (<i>He hurries into the cabin.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a smile of cruel triumph--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I can tell her &hellip; confidentially
&hellip; I can pretend I'm forced to tell her &hellip; as Sam's
mother did with me &hellip; because I feel it's due to her
happiness and Gordon's &hellip; it will explain my objection to the
engagement &hellip; oh, it can't help succeeding &hellip; my Gordon
will come back! &hellip; I'll see he never gets away again!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She calls</i>) Madeline!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why is she calling Madeline? &hellip; I
must watch all this carefully! &hellip;</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>comes rushing out in wild alarm</i>) Bad news! Navy
has drawn ahead--half a length--looks like Navy's race, he
said--(<i>then violently</i>) But what does he know, that damn fool
announcer--some poor boob--!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>excitedly</i>) He doesn't know Gordon! He's always
best when he's pushed to the limit!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>She calls more sharply.</i>) Madeline!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>turns around to stare at her--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why is she calling Madeline? &hellip;
she's bound she'll meddle in their lives &hellip; I've got to watch
her &hellip; well, let's see.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He touches Madeline on the shoulder.</i>) Mrs. Evans is
calling you, Miss Arnold.</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>impatiently</i>) Yes, Mrs. Evans. But they're
getting closer. Why don't you come and watch?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>not heeding--impressively</i>) There's something I
must tell you.</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>in hopeless irritation</i>) But--Oh, all right.
(<i>She hurries over to her, glancing eagerly over her shoulder
towards the river.</i>) Yes, Mrs. Evans?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>moves from the rail toward them--thinking
keenly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must watch this &hellip; she's in a
desperate meddling mood! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>impressively</i>) First, give me your word of honor
that you'll never reveal a word of what I'm going to tell you to a
living soul--above all not to Gordon!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>looking at her in amazement--soothingly</i>)
Couldn't you tell me later, Mrs. Evans--after the race?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sternly--grabbing her by the wrist</i>) No, now! Do
you promise?</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>with helpless annoyance</i>) Yes, Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sternly</i>) For the sake of your future happiness and
my son's I've got to speak! Your engagement forces me to! You've
probably wondered why I objected. It's because the marriage is
impossible. You can't marry Gordon! I speak as your friend! You
must break your engagement with him at once!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>cannot believe her ears--suddenly
panic-stricken</i>) But why--why?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>who has come closer--resentfully thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She wants to ruin my son's life as she
ruined mine! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>relentlessly</i>) Why? Because--</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>steps up suddenly beside them--sharply and sternly
commanding</i>) No, Nina! (<i>He taps Madeline on the shoulder and
draws her aside. Nina lets go of her wrist and stares after them in
a sort of stunned stupor.</i>) Miss Arnold, as a doctor I feel it
my duty to tell you that Mrs. Evans isn't herself. Pay no attention
to anything she may say to you. She's just passed through a crucial
period in a woman's life and she's morbidly jealous of you and
subject to queer delusions! (<i>He smiles kindly at her.</i>) So
get back to the race! And God bless you! (<i>He grips her hand,
strangely moved.</i>)</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>gratefully</i>) Thank you. I understand, I think.
Poor Mrs. Evans! (<i>She hurries back to the rail, raising her
glasses.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>springing to her feet and finding her voice--with
despairing accusation</i>) Ned!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>steps quickly to her side</i>) I'm sorry, Nina, but
I warned you not to meddle. (<i>then affectionately</i>) And Gordon
is--well--sort of my stepson, isn't he? I really want him to be
happy. (<i>then smiling good-naturedly</i>) All the same, I can't
help hoping he'll be beaten in this race. As an oarsman he recalls
his father, Gordon Shaw, to me. (<i>He turns away and raises his
glasses, going back to the rail. Nina slumps down in her chair
again.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--Damn! They all look even from here! Can you tell which is
which, Madeline?</p>

<p>MADELINE--No--not yet--oh, dear, this is awful! Gordon!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>looking about her in the air--with a dazed
question</i>) Gordon?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Damn that Darrell! &hellip; if he
hadn't interfered Nina would have told &hellip; something of
infinite importance, I know! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He comes and again sits on the deck by her chair and takes
her hand.</i>) Because what, Nina--my dear little Nina Cara
Nina--because what? Let me help you!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>staring before her as if she were in a trance--simply,
like a young girl</i>) Yes, Charlie. Yes, Father. Because all of
Sam's father's family have been insane. His mother told me that
time so I wouldn't have his baby. I was going to tell Madeline that
so she wouldn't marry Gordon. But it would have been a lie because
Gordon isn't really Sam's child at all, he's Ned's. Ned gave him to
me and I gave him to Sam so Sam could have a healthy child and be
well and happy. And Sam is well and happy, don't you think?
(<i>childishly</i>) So I haven't been such an awfully wicked girl,
have I, Father?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>horrified and completely sobered by what he has
heard--stares at her with stunned eyes</i>) Nina! Good God! Do you
know what you're saying?</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>excitedly</i>) There! The one on this side! I saw
the color on their blades just now!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>anxiously</i>) Are you sure? Then he's a little
behind the other two!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>excitedly</i>) The one in the middle seems to be
ahead! Is that the Navy? (<i>But the others pay no attention to
him. All three are leaning over the rail, their glasses glued to
their eyes, looking up the river. The noise from the whistles is
now very loud. The cheering from the observation trains can be
heard.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>stares into her face with great pity now</i>)
Merciful God, Nina! Then you've lived all these years--with this
horror! And you and Darrell deliberately--?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>without looking at him--to the air</i>) Sam's mother
said I had a right to be happy too.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--And you didn't love Darrell then--?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>as before</i>) I did afterwards. I don't now. Ned is
dead, too. (<i>softly</i>) Only you are alive now, Father--and
Gordon.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>gets up and bends over her paternally, stroking her
hair with a strange, wild, joyous pity</i>) Oh, Nina--poor little
Nina--my Nina--how you must have suffered! I forgive you! I forgive
you everything! I forgive even your trying to tell Madeline--you
wanted to keep Gordon--oh, I understand that--and I forgive
you!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>as before--affectionately and strangely</i>) And I
forgive you, Father. It was all your fault in the beginning, wasn't
it? You mustn't ever meddle with human lives again!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>wildly excited</i>) Gordon's sprinting, isn't he?
He's drawing up on that middle one!</p>

<p>MADELINE--Yes! Oh, come on, Gordon!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>exultantly</i>) Come on, Navy!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>who is standing next to Ned, whirls on him in a
furious passion</i>) What's that? What the hell's the matter with
you?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>facing him--with a strange friendliness slaps him
on the back</i>) We've got to beat these Gordons, Sam! We've got to
beat--</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>raging</i>) You--! (<i>He draws back his fist--then
suddenly horrified at what he is doing but still angry, grabs
Darrell by both shoulders and shakes him.</i>) Wake up! What the
hell's got into you? Have you gone crazy?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>mockingly</i>) Probably! It runs in my family! All
of my father's people were happy lunatics--not healthy, country
folk like yours, Sam! Ha!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>staring at him</i>) Ned, old man, what's the trouble?
You said "Navy."</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>ironically--with a bitter hopeless laugh</i>) Slip
of the tongue! I meant Gordon! Meant Gordon, of course! Gordon is
always meant--meant to win! Come on, Gordon! It's fate!</p>

<p>MADELINE--Here they come! They're both spurting! I can see
Gordon's back!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>forgetting everything else, turns back to the
race</i>) Come on, boy! Come on, son! (<i>The chorus of noise is
now a bedlam as the crews near the finish line. The people have to
yell and scream to make themselves heard.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>getting up--thinking with a strange, strident, wild
passion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hear the Father laughing! &hellip; O
Mother God, protect my son! &hellip; let Gordon fly to you in
heaven! &hellip; quick, Gordon! &hellip; love is the Father's
lightning! &hellip; Madeline will bring you down in flames!
&hellip; I hear His screaming laughter! &hellip; fly back to me!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She is looking desperately up into the sky as if some race
of life and death were happening there for her.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>holding on to a stanchion and leaning far out at the
imminent risk of falling in</i>) One spurt more will do it! Come
on, boy, come on! It took death to beat Gordon Shaw! You can't be
beaten either, Gordon! Lift her out of the water, son! Stroke!
Stroke! He's gaining! Now! Over the line, boy! Over with her!
Stroke! That's done it! He's won! He's won!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>has been shrieking at the same time</i>) Gordon!
Gordon! He's won! Oh, he's fainted! Poor dear darling! (<i>She
remains standing on the rail, leaning out dangerously, holding on
with one hand, looking down longingly toward his shell.</i>)</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>bounding back to the deck, his face congested and
purple with a frenzy of joy, dancing about</i>) He's won! By God,
it was close! Greatest race in the history of rowing! He's the
greatest oarsman God ever made! (<i>embracing Nina and kissing her
frantically</i>) Aren't you happy, Nina? Our Gordon! The greatest
ever!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>torturedly--trying incoherently to force out a last
despairing protest</i>) No!--not yours!--mine!--and
Gordon's!--Gordon is Gordon's!--he was my Gordon!--his Gordon is
mine!</p>

<p>EVANS--(<i>soothingly, humoring her--kissing her again</i>) Of
course he's yours, dear--and a dead ringer for Gordon Shaw, too!
Gordon's body! Gordon's spirit! Your body and spirit, too, Nina!
He's not like me, lucky for him! I'm a poor boob! I never could row
worth a damn! (<i>He suddenly staggers as if he were very drunk,
leaning on Marsden--then gives a gasp and collapses inertly to the
deck, lying on his back.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>stares down at him stupidly--then thinking
strangely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I knew it! &hellip; I saw the end
beginning! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He touches Nina's arm--in a low voice</i>) Nina--your
husband! (<i>touching Darrell who has stood staring straight before
him with a bitter ironical smile on his lips</i>) Ned--your friend!
Doctor Darrell--a patient!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>stares down at Evans--slowly, as if trying to bring
her mind back to him</i>) My husband? (<i>suddenly with a cry of
pain, sinks on her knees beside the body</i>) Sam!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>looking down at him--thinking yearningly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Is her husband dead &hellip; at last?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with a shudder at his thoughts</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No! &hellip; I don't hope! &hellip; I
don't! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He cries.</i>) Sam! (<i>He kneels down, feels of his heart,
pulse, looks into his face--with a change to a strictly
professional manner</i>) He's not dead. Only a bad stroke.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a cry of grief</i>) Oh, Ned, did all our old
secret hopes do this at last?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>professionally, staring at her coldly</i>) Bosh,
Mrs. Evans! We're not in the Congo that we can believe in evil
charms! (<i>sternly</i>) In his condition, Mr. Evans must have
absolute quiet and peace of mind or--And perfect care! You must
tend him night and day! And I will! We've got to keep him
happy!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>dully</i>) Again? (<i>then sternly in her turn, as if
swearing a pledge to herself</i>) I will never leave his side! I
will never tell him anything that might disturb his peace!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>standing above them--thinking exultantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I will not have long to wait now!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then ashamed</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How can I think such things &hellip;
poor Sam! &hellip; he was &hellip; I mean he is my friend
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with assertive loyalty</i>) A rare spirit! A pure and simple
soul! A good man--yes, a good man! God bless him! (<i>He makes a
motion over the body like a priest blessing.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>his voice suddenly breaking with a sincere
human</i> <i>grief</i>) Sam, old boy! I'm so damned sorry! I will
give my life to save you!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in dull anguish</i>) Save--again? (<i>then lovingly,
kissing Evans' face</i>) Dear husband, you have tried to make me
happy, I will give you my happiness again! I will give you Gordon
to give to Madeline!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>still standing on the rail, staring after
Gordon's</i> s<i>hell</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gordon! &hellip; dear lover &hellip;
how tired &hellip; but you'll rest in my arms &hellip; your head
will lie on my breast &hellip; soon! &hellip;</p>

<p align="center">(<i>Curtain</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="a09" id="a09">ACT NINE</a>
</h1>

<p>SCENE--<i>Several months later. A terrace on the Evans' estate
on Long Island. In the rear, the terrace overlooks a small harbor
with the ocean beyond. On the right is a side entrance of the
pretentious villa. On the left is a hedge with an arched gateway
leading to a garden. The terrace is paved with rough stone. There
is a stone bench at center, a recliner at right, a wicker table and
armchair at left.</i></p>

<p><i>It is late afternoon of a day in early fall. Gordon Evans is
sitting on the stone bench, his chin propped on his hands, Madeline
standing behind him, her arm about his shoulders. Gordon is over
six feet tall with the figure of a trained athlete. His sun-bronzed
face is extremely handsome after the fashion of the magazine cover
American collegian. It is a strong face but of a strength wholly
material in quality. He has been too thoroughly trained to progress
along a certain groove to success ever to question it or be
dissatisfied with its rewards. At the same time, although entirely
an unimaginative code-bound gentleman of his groove, he is boyish
and likable, of an even, modest, sporting disposition. His
expression is boyishly forlorn, but he is making a manly effort to
conceal his grief.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Madeline is much the same as in the previous Act except that
there is now a distinct maternal older feeling in her attitude
toward Gordon as she endeavors to console him.</i>
</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>tenderly, smoothing his hair</i>) There, dear! I
know how horribly hard it is for you. I loved him, too. He was so
wonderful and sweet to me.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>his voice trembling</i>) I didn't really realize he
was gone--until out at the cemetery--(<i>His voice breaks.</i>)</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>kissing his hair</i>) Darling! Please don't!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>rebelliously</i>) Damn it, I don't see why he had to
die! (<i>with a groan</i>) It was that constant grind at the
office! I ought to have insisted on his taking better care of
himself. But I wasn't home enough, that's the trouble. I couldn't
watch him. (<i>then bitterly</i>) But I can't see why Mother
didn't!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>reprovingly but showing she shares his
feeling</i>) Now! You mustn't start feeling bitter toward her.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>contritely</i>) I know I shouldn't. (<i>but
returning to</i> <i>his bitter tone</i>) But I can't help
remembering how unreasonably she's acted about our engagement.</p>

<p>MADELINE--Not since your father was taken sick, she hasn't,
dear. She's been wonderfully nice.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>in the same tone</i>) Nice? Indifferent, you mean!
She doesn't seem to care a damn one way or the other any more!</p>

<p>MADELINE--You could hardly expect her to think of anyone but
your father. She's been with him every minute. I never saw such
devotion. (<i>thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Will Gordon ever get old and sick like
that? &hellip; oh, I hope we'll both die before! &hellip; but I'd
nurse him just as she did his father &hellip; I'll always love him!
&hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>consoled--proudly</i>) Yes, she sure was wonderful
to him, all right! (<i>then coming back to his old tone</i>)
But--this may sound rotten of me--I always had a queer feeling she
was doing it as a duty. And when he died, I felt her grief was--not
from love for him--at least, only the love of a friend, not a
wife's love. (<i>as if under some urgent compulsion from
within</i>) I've never told you, but I've always felt, ever since I
was a little kid, that she didn't really love Dad. She liked him
and respected him. She was a wonderful wife. But I'm sure she
didn't love him. (<i>blurting it out as if he couldn't help it</i>)
I'll tell you, Madeline! I've always felt she cared a lot
for--Darrell. (<i>hastily</i>) Of course, I might be wrong.
(<i>then bursting out</i>) No, I'm not wrong! I've felt it too
strongly, ever since I was a kid. And then when I was
eleven--something happened. I've been sure of it since then.</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>thinking in amazement, but not without a queer
satisfaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Does he mean that she was unfaithful to
his father? &hellip; no, he'd never believe that &hellip; but what
else could he mean? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>wonderingly</i>) Gordon! Do you mean you've been sure that
your mother was--</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>outraged by something in her tone--jumping to his
feet and flinging her hand off--roughly</i>) Was what? What do you
mean, Madeline?</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>frightened--placatingly puts her arms around</i>
<i>him</i>) I didn't mean anything, dear. I simply thought you
meant--</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>still indignant</i>) All I meant was that she must
have fallen in love with Darrell long after she was married--and
then she sent him away for Dad's sake--and mine, too, I suppose. He
kept coming back every couple of years. He didn't have guts enough
to stay away for good! Oh, I suppose I'm unfair. I suppose it was
damned hard on him. He fought it down, too, on account of his
friendship for Dad. (<i>then with a bitter laugh</i>) I suppose
they'll be getting married now! And I'll have to wish them good
luck. Dad would want me to. He was game. (<i>with a bitter gloomy
air</i>) Life is damn queer, that's all I've got to say!</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>thinking with a sort of tender, loving scorn for
his boyish na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How little he knows her! &hellip; Mr.
Evans was a fine man but &hellip; Darrell must have been
fascinating once &hellip; if she loved anyone she isn't the kind
who would hesitate &hellip; any more than I have with Gordon
&hellip; oh, I'll never be unfaithful to Gordon &hellip; I'll love
him always! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She runs her fingers through his hair
caressingly--comfortingly</i>) You must never blame them, dear. No
one can help love. We couldn't, could we? (<i>She sits beside him.
He takes her in his arms. They kiss each other with rising passion.
Marsden comes in noiselessly from the garden, a bunch of roses and
a pair of shears in his hands. He looks younger, calm and
contented. He is dressed in his all black, meticulous, perfectly
tailored mourning costume. He stands looking at the two lovers, a
queer agitation coming into his face.</i>)</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>scandalized as an old maid--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must say! &hellip; his father hardly
cold in his grave! &hellip; it's positively bestial! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then struggling with himself--with a defensive
self-mockery</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Only it wasn't his father &hellip; what
is Sam to Darrell's son? &hellip; and even if he were Sam's son,
what have the living to do with the dead? &hellip; his duty is to
love that life may keep on living &hellip; and what has their
loving to do with me? &hellip; my life is cool green shade wherein
comes no scorching zenith sun of passion and possession to wither
the heart with bitter poisons &hellip; my life gathers roses,
coolly crimson, in sheltered gardens, on late afternoons in love
with evening &hellip; roses heavy with after-blooming of the long
day, desiring evening &hellip; my life is an evening &hellip; Nina
is a rose, my rose, exhausted by the long, hot day, leaning wearily
toward peace.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He kisses one of the roses with a simple sentimental
smile--then still smiling, makes a gesture toward the two
lovers.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That is on another planet, called the
world &hellip; Nina and I have moved on to the
moon.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>passionately</i>) Dear one! Sweetheart!</p>

<p>GORDON--Madeline! I love you!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>looking at them--gaily mocking--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Once I'd have felt jealous &hellip;
cheated &hellip; swindled by God out of joy! &hellip; I would have
thought bitterly, "The Gordons have all the luck!" &hellip; but now
I know that dear old Charlie &hellip; yes, poor dear old
Charlie!--passed beyond desire, has all the luck at last!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then matter-of-factly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I'll have to interrupt their
biological preparations &hellip; there are many things still to be
done this evening &hellip; Age's terms of peace, after the long
interlude of war with life, have still to be concluded &hellip;
Youth must keep decently away &hellip; so many old wounds may have
to be unbound, and old scars pointed to with pride, to prove to
ourselves we have been brave and noble! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He lets the shears drop to the ground. They jump startledly
and turn around. He smiles quietly.</i>) Sorry to disturb you. I've
been picking some roses for your mother, Gordon. Flowers really
have the power to soothe grief. I suppose it was that discovery
that led to their general use at funerals--and weddings! (<i>He
hands a rose to Madeline.</i>) Here, Madeline, here's a rose for
you. Hail, Love, we who have died, salute you! (<i>He smiles
strangely. She takes the rose automatically, staring at him
uncomprehendingly.</i>)</p>

<p>MADELINE--(<i>thinking suspiciously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a queer creature! &hellip; there's
something uncanny! &hellip; oh, don't be silly! &hellip; it's only
poor old Charlie! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She makes him a mocking curtsey</i>.) Thank you, Uncle
Charlie!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking with sneering pity</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Poor old guy! &hellip; he means well
&hellip; Dad liked him.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>pretending an interest in the roses</i>) They're pretty.
(<i>then suddenly</i>) Where's Mother--still in the house?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--She was trying to get rid of the last of the people.
I'm going in. Shall I tell her you want to see her? It would give
her an excuse to get away.</p>

<p>GORDON--Yes. Will you? (<i>Marsden goes into the house on
right.</i>)</p>

<p>MADELINE--You'd better see your mother alone. I'll go down to
the plane and wait for you. You want to fly back before dark, don't
you?</p>

<p>GORDON--Yes, and we ought to get started soon. (<i>moodily</i>)
Maybe it would be better if you weren't here. There are some things
I feel I ought to say to her--and Darrell. I've got to do what I
know Dad would have wanted. I've got to be fair. He always was to
everyone all his life.</p>

<p>MADELINE--You dear, you! You couldn't be unfair to anyone if you
tried! (<i>She kisses him.</i>) Don't be too long.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>moodily</i>) You bet I won't! It won't be so
pleasant I'll want to drag it out!</p>

<p>MADELINE--Good-bye for a while then.</p>

<p>GORDON--So long. (<i>He looks after her lovingly as she goes out
right, rear, around the corner of the house. Thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Madeline's wonderful! &hellip; I don't
deserve my luck &hellip; but, God, I sure do love her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sits down on the bench again, his chin on his
hands.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It seems rotten and selfish to be happy
&hellip; when Dad &hellip; oh, he understands, he'd want me to be
&hellip; it's funny how I got to care more for Dad than for Mother
&hellip; I suppose it was finding out she loved Darrell &hellip; I
can remember that day seeing her kiss him &hellip; it did something
to me I never got over &hellip; but she made Dad happy &hellip; she
gave up her own happiness for his sake &hellip; that was certainly
damn fine &hellip; that was playing the game &hellip; I'm a hell of
a one to criticize &hellip; my own mother! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>changing the subject of his thoughts abruptly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Forget it! &hellip; think of Madeline
&hellip; we'll be married &hellip; then two months' honeymoon in
Europe &hellip; God, that'll be great! &hellip; then back and dive
into the business &hellip; Dad relied on me to carry on where he
left off &hellip; I'll have to start at the bottom but I'll get to
the top in a hurry, I promise you that, Dad! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Nina and Darrell come out of the house on the right. He
hears</i> <i>the sound of the door and looks around. Thinking
resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Funny! &hellip; I can't stand it even
now! &hellip; when I see him with Mother! &hellip; I'd like to beat
him up! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He gets to his feet, his face unconsciously becoming older
and cold and severe. He stares accusingly at them as they come
slowly toward him in silence. Nina looks much older than in the
preceding Act. Resignation has come into her face, a resignation
that uses no make-up, that has given up the struggle to be sexually
attractive and look younger. She is dressed in deep black.
Darrell's deep sunburn of the tropics has faded, leaving his skin a
Mongolian yellow. He, too, looks much older. His expression is sad
and bitter.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>glancing at Gordon searchingly--thinking
sadly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He sent for me to say good-bye &hellip;
really good-bye forever this time &hellip; he's not my son now, nor
Gordon's son, nor Sam's, nor Ned's &hellip; he has become that
stranger, another woman's lover.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>also after a quick keen glance at Gordon's
face--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There's something up &hellip; some
final accounting &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>thinking resignedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well, let's get it over &hellip; then I
can go back to work &hellip; I've stayed too long up here &hellip;
Preston must be wondering if I've deserted him&hellip; .</p>

<p>(<i>then with a wondering sadness</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Is that my son? &hellip; my flesh and
blood? &hellip; staring at me with such cold enmity? &hellip; how
sad and idiotic this all is! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>putting on a tone of joking annoyance</i>) Your
message was a godsend, Gordon. Those stupid people with their
social condolences were killing me. Perhaps I'm morbid but I always
have the feeling that they're secretly glad someone is dead--that
it flatters their vanity and makes them feel superior because
they're living. (<i>She sits wearily on the bench. Darrell sits on
side of the recliner at right.</i>)</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>repelled by this idea--stiffly</i>) They were all
good friends of Dad's. Why shouldn't they be sincerely sorry? His
death ought to be a loss to everyone who knew him. (<i>His voice
trembles. He turns away and walks to the table. Thinking
bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She doesn't care a damn! &hellip; she's
free to marry Darrell now! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking sadly, looking at his back</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's accusing me because I'm not
weeping &hellip; well, I did weep &hellip; all I could &hellip;
there aren't many tears left &hellip; it was too bad Sam had to die
&hellip; living suited him &hellip; he was so contented with
himself &hellip; but I can't feel guilty &hellip; I helped him to
live &hellip; I made him believe I loved him &hellip; his mind was
perfectly sane to the end &hellip; and just before he died, he
smiled at me &hellip;so gratefully and forgivingly, I thought
&hellip; closing our life together with that smile &hellip; that
life is dead &hellip; its regrets are dead &hellip; I am sad but
there's comfort in the thought that now I am free at last to rot
away in peace &hellip; I'll go and live in Father's old home
&hellip; Sam bought that back &hellip; I suppose he left it to me
&hellip; Charlie will come in every day to visit &hellip; he'll
comfort and amuse me &hellip; we can talk together of the old days
&hellip; when I was a girl &hellip; when I was happy &hellip;
before I fell in love with Gordon Shaw and all this tangled mess of
love and hate and pain and birth began! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>staring at Gordon's back resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It gets under my skin to see him act so
unfeelingly toward his mother! &hellip; if he only knew what she's
suffered for his sake! &hellip; the Gordon Shaw ideal passed on
through Sam has certainly made my son an insensitive clod!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with disgust</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Bah, what has that young man to do with
me? &hellip; compared to Preston he's only a well-muscled, handsome
fool! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a trace of anger</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I'd like to jolt his stupid
self-complacency! &hellip; if he knew the facts about himself, he
wouldn't be sobbing sentimentally about Sam &hellip; he'd better
change his tune or I'll certainly be tempted to tell him &hellip;
there's no reason for his not knowing now &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>His face is flushed. He has worked himself into a real
anger.</i>)</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>suddenly, having got back his control, turns to
them--coldly</i>) There are certain things connected with Dad's
will I thought I ought to--(<i>with a tinge of satisfied
superiority</i>) I don't believe Dad told you about his will, did
he, Mother?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>indifferently</i>) No.</p>

<p>GORDON--Well, the whole estate goes to you and me, of course. I
didn't mean that. (<i>with a resentful look at Darrell</i>) But
there is one provision that is peculiar, to say the least. It
concerns you, Doctor Darrell--a half-million for your Station to be
used in biological research work.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>his face suddenly flushing with anger</i>) What's
that? That's a joke, isn't it? (<i>thinking furiously</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It's worse! &hellip; it's a deliberate
insult! &hellip; a last sneer of ownership! &hellip; of my life!
&hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>coldly sneering</i>) I thought it must be a joke
myself--but Dad insisted.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>angrily</i>) Well, I won't accept it--and that's
final!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>coldly</i>) It's not left to you but to the Station.
Your supervision is mentioned but I suppose if you won't carry on,
whoever is in real charge down there will be only too glad to
accept it.</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>stupefied</i>) That means Preston! But Sam didn't
even know Preston--except from hearing me talk about him! What had
Sam to do with Preston? Preston is none of his business! I'll
advise Preston to refuse it! (<i>thinking torturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But it's for science! &hellip; he has
no right to refuse! &hellip; I have no right to ask him to!
&hellip; God damn Sam! &hellip; wasn't it enough for him to own my
wife, my son, in his lifetime? &hellip; now in death he reaches out
to steal Preston! &hellip; to steal my work! &hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Even in death Sam makes people suffer
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>sympathetically</i>) It isn't for you--nor for Preston. It's
for science, Ned. You must look at it that way.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>thinking resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What a tender tone she takes toward
him! &hellip; she's forgotten Dad already! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a sneer</i>) You'd better accept. Half-millions aren't
being thrown away for nothing every day.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>in anguish--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How can Gordon insult poor Ned like
that! &hellip; his own father! &hellip; Ned has suffered too much!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>sharply</i>) I think you've said about enough, Gordon!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>bitterly, but trying to control
himself--meaningly</i>) I haven't said all I'm going to say,
Mother!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking--at first frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What does he mean? &hellip; does he
know about Ned being &hellip; ?</p>

<p>(<i>then with a sort of defiant relief</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well, what does it matter what he
thinks of me? &hellip; he's hers now, anyway.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking vindictively</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hope he knows the truth, for if he
doesn't, by God, I'll tell him! &hellip; if only to get something
back from Sam of all he's stolen from me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>authoritatively--as Gordon hesitates</i>) Well, what have
you got to say? Your mother and I are waiting.</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>furiously, taking a threatening step toward him</i>)
Shut up, you! Don't take that tone with me or I'll forget your
age--(<i>contemptuously</i>) and give you a spanking!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking hysterically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Spanking! &hellip; the son spanks the
father! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>laughing hysterically</i>) Oh, Gordon, don't make me laugh!
It's all so funny!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>jumps from his chair and goes to
her--solicitously</i>) Nina! Don't mind him! He doesn't
realize--</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>maddened, comes closer</i>) I realize a lot! I
realize you've acted like a cur! (<i>He steps forward and slaps
Darrell across the face viciously. Darrell staggers back from the
force of the blow, his hands to his face. Nina screams and flings
herself on Gordon, holding his arms.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>piteously--hysterically</i>) For God's sake, Gordon!
What would your father say? You don't know what you're doing!
You're hitting your father!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>suddenly breaking down--chokingly</i>) No--it's all
right, son--all right--you didn't know--</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>crushed, overcome by remorse for his blow</i>) I'm
sorry--sorry--you're right, Mother--Dad would feel as if I'd hit
him--just as bad as if I'd hit him!</p>

<p>DARRELL--It's nothing, son--nothing!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>brokenly</i>) That's damn fine, Darrell--damn fine
and sporting of you! It was a rotten, dirty trick! Accept my
apology, Darrell, won't you?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>staring at him stupidly--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Darrell? &hellip; he calls me Darrell!
&hellip; but doesn't he know? &hellip; I thought she told
him.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>laughing hysterically--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I told him he hit his father &hellip;
but he can't understand me! &hellip; why, of course he can't!
&hellip; how could he? &hellip;</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>insistently holding out his hand</i>) I'm damned
sorry! I didn't mean it! Shake hands, won't you?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>doing so mechanically--stupidly</i>) Only too
glad--pleased to meet you--know you by reputation--the famous
oarsman--great race you stroked last June--but I was hoping the
Navy would give you a beating.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking in desperate hysterical anguish</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, I wish Ned would go away and stay
away forever! &hellip; I can't bear to watch him suffer any more!
&hellip; it's too frightful! &hellip; yes, God the Father, I hear
you laughing &hellip; you see the joke &hellip; I'm laughing too
&hellip; it's all so crazy, isn't it? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>laughing hysterically</i>) Oh, Ned! Poor Ned! You were born
unlucky!</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>making her sit down again--soothing her</i>) Mother!
Stop laughing! Please! It's all right--all right between us! I've
apologized! (<i>as she has grown calmer</i>) And now I want to say
what I was going to say. It wasn't anything bad. It was just that I
want you to know how fine I think you've both acted. I've known
ever since I was a kid that you and Darrell were in love with each
other. I hated the idea on Father's account--that's only natural,
isn't it?--but I knew it was unfair, that people can't help loving
each other any more than Madeline and I could have helped
ourselves. And I saw how fair you both were to Dad--what a good
wife you were, Mother--what a true friend you were, Darrell--and
how damn much he loved you both! So all I wanted to say is, now
he's dead, I hope you'll get married and I hope you'll be as happy
as you both deserve--(<i>Here he breaks down, kissing her and then
breaking away.</i>) I've got to say good-bye--got to fly back
before dark--Madeline's waiting. (<i>He takes Darrell's hand and
shakes it again. They have both been staring at him stupidly.</i>)
Good-bye, Darrell! Good luck!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>thinking sufferingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why does he keep on calling me Darrell
&hellip; he's my boy &hellip; I'm his father &hellip; I've got to
make him realize I'm his father! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>holding Gordon's hand</i>) Listen, son. It's my turn. I've
got to tell you something--</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>thinking torturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, he mustn't! &hellip; I feel he
mustn't! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>sharply</i>) Ned! First, let me ask Gordon a question.
(<i>then looking her son in the eyes, slowly and impressively</i>)
Do you think I was ever unfaithful to your father, Gordon?</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>startled, stares at her--shocked and horrified--then
suddenly he blurts out indignantly</i>) Mother, what do you think I
am--as rotten-minded as that! (<i>pleadingly</i>) Please, Mother,
I'm not as bad as that! I know you're the best woman that ever
lived--the best of all! I don't even except Madeline!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a sobbing triumphant cry</i>) My dear Gordon! You
do love me, don't you?</p>

<p>GORDON--(<i>kneeling beside her and kissing her</i>) Of
course!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>pushing him away--tenderly</i>) And now go! Hurry!
Madeline is waiting! Give her my love! Come to see me once in a
while in the years to come! Good-bye, dear! (<i>turning to Darrell,
who is standing with a sad resigned expression--imploringly</i>)
Did you still want to tell Gordon something, Ned?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>forcing a tortured smile</i>) Not for anything in
the world! Good-bye, son.</p>

<p>GORDON--Good-bye, sir. (<i>He hurries off around the corner of
the house at left, rear, thinking troubledly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What does she think I am? &hellip; I've
never thought that! &hellip; I couldn't! &hellip; my own mother!
I'd kill myself if I ever even caught myself thinking &hellip;
!</p>

<p>(<i>He is gone.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>turns to Ned, gratefully taking his hand and pressing
it</i>) Poor dear Ned, you've always had to give! How can I ever
thank you?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with an ironical smile--forcing a joking tone</i>)
By refusing me when I ask you to marry me! For I've got to ask you!
Gordon expects it! And he'll be so pleased when he knows you turned
me down. (<i>Marsden comes out of the house.</i>) Hello, here comes
Charlie. I must hurry. Will you marry me, Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a sad smile</i>) No. Certainly not. Our ghosts
would torture us to death! (<i>then forlornly</i>) But I wish I did
love you, Ned! Those were wonderful afternoons long ago! The Nina
of those afternoons will always live in me, will always love her
lover, Ned, the father of her baby!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>lifting her hand to his lips--tenderly</i>) Thank
you for that! And that Ned will always adore his beautiful Nina!
Remember him! Forget me! I'm going back to work. (<i>He laughs
softly and sadly.</i>) I leave you to Charlie. You'd better marry
him, Nina--if you want peace. And after all, I think you owe it to
him for his life-long devotion.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>thinking uneasily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">They're talking about me &hellip; why
doesn't he go? &hellip; she doesn't love him any more &hellip; even
now he's all heat and energy and the tormenting drive of noon
&hellip; can't he see she is in love with evening? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>clearing his throat uneasily</i>) Do I hear my name taken in
vain?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>looking at Marsden with a strange yearning</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Peace! &hellip; yes &hellip; that is
all I desire &hellip; I can no longer imagine happiness &hellip;
Charlie has found peace &hellip; he will be tender &hellip; as my
father was when I was a girl &hellip; when I could imagine
happiness &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a girlish coquettishness and embarrassment--making way
for him on the bench beside her--strangely</i>) Ned's just proposed
to me. I refused him, Charlie. I don't love him any more.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>sitting down beside her</i>) I suspected as much.
Then whom do you love, Nina Cara Nina?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sadly smiling</i>) You, Charlie, I suppose. I have
always loved your love for me. (<i>She kisses him--wistfully</i>)
Will you let me rot away in peace?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>strongly</i>) All my life I've waited to bring you
peace.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>sadly teasing</i>) If you've waited that long,
Charlie, we'd better get married tomorrow. But I forgot. You
haven't asked me yet, have you? Do you want me to marry you,
Charlie?</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>humbly</i>) Yes, Nina. (<i>thinking with a strange
ecstasy</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I knew the time would come at last when
I would hear her ask that! &hellip; I could never have said it,
never! &hellip; oh, russet-golden afternoon, you are a mellow fruit
of happiness ripely falling! &hellip;</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>amused--with a sad smile</i>) Bless you, my
children! (<i>He turns to go.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--I don't suppose we'll ever see you again, Ned.</p>

<p>DARRELL--I hope not, Nina. A scientist shouldn't believe in
ghosts. (<i>with a mocking smile</i>) But perhaps we'll become part
of cosmic positive and negative electric charges and meet
again.</p>

<p>NINA--In our afternoons--again?</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>smiling sadly</i>) Again. In our afternoons.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>coming out of his day dream</i>) We'll be married
in the afternoon, decidedly. I've already picked out the church,
Nina--a gray ivied chapel, full of restful shadow, symbolical of
the peace we have found. The crimsons and purples in the windows
will stain our faces with faded passion. It must be in the hour
before sunset when the earth dreams in afterthoughts and mystic
premonitions of life's beauty. And then we'll go up to your old
home to live. Mine wouldn't be suitable for us. Mother and Jane
live there in memory. And I'll work in your father's old study. He
won't mind me. (<i>From the bay below comes the roaring hum of an
airplane motor. Nina and Darrell jump startledly and go to the rear
of the terrace to watch the plane ascend from the water, standing
side by side. Marsden remains oblivious.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with anguish</i>) Gordon! Good-bye, dear! (<i>pointing
as the plane climbs higher moving away off to the
left--bitterly</i>) See, Ned! He's leaving me without a backward
look!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>joyfully</i>) No! He's circling. He's coming back!
(<i>The roar of the engine grows steadily nearer now.</i>) He's
going to pass directly over us! (<i>Their eyes follow the plane as
it comes swiftly nearer and passes directly over them.</i>) See!
He's waving to us!</p>

<p>NINA--Oh, Gordon! My dear son! (<i>She waves
frantically.</i>)</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>with a last tortured protest</i>) Nina! Are you
forgetting? He's my son, too! (<i>He shouts up at the sky</i>)
You're my son, Gordon! You're my--(<i>He controls himself
abruptly--with a smile of cynical self-pity</i>) He can't hear!
Well, at least I've done my duty! (<i>then with a grim
fatalism--with a final wave of his hand at the sky</i>) Good-bye,
Gordon's son!</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with tortured exultance</i>) Fly up to heaven, Gordon!
Fly with your love to heaven! Fly always! Never crash to earth like
my old Gordon! Be happy, dear! You've got to be happy!</p>

<p>DARRELL--(<i>sardonically</i>) I've heard that cry for happiness
before, Nina! I remember hearing myself cry it--once--it must have
been long ago! I'll get back to my cells--sensible unicellular life
that floats in the sea and has never learned the cry for happiness!
I'm going, Nina. (<i>as she remains oblivious, staring after the
plane--thinking fatalistically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She doesn't hear, either&hellip; .</p>

<p>(<i>He laughs up at the sky.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, God, so deaf and dumb and blind!
&hellip; teach me to be resigned to be an atom! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He walks off, right, and enters the house.</i>)</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>finally lowering her eyes--confusedly</i>) Gone. My
eyes are growing dim. Where is Ned? Gone, too. And Sam is gone.
They're all dead. Where are Father and Charlie? (<i>With a shiver
of fear she hurries over and sits on the bench beside Marsden,
huddling against him.</i>) Gordon is dead, Father. I've just had a
cable. What I mean is, he flew away to another life--my son,
Gordon, Charlie. So we're alone again--just as we used to be.</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>putting his arm around her--affectionately</i>)
Just as we used to be, dear Nina Cara Nina, before Gordon came.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>looking up at the sky--strangely</i>) My having a son
was a failure, wasn't it? He couldn't give me happiness. Sons are
always their fathers. They pass through the mother to become their
father again. The Sons of the Father have all been failures!
Failing they died for us, they flew away to other lives, they could
not stay with us, they could not give us happiness!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>paternally--in her father's tone</i>) You had best
forget the whole affair of your association with the Gordons. After
all, dear Nina, there was something unreal in all that has happened
since you first met Gordon Shaw, something extravagant and
fantastic, the sort of thing that isn't done, really, in our
afternoons. So let's you and me forget the whole distressing
episode, regard it as an interlude, of trial and preparation, say,
in which our souls have been scraped clean of impure flesh and made
worthy to bleach in peace.</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>with a strange smile</i>) Strange interlude! Yes, our
lives are merely strange dark interludes in the electrical display
of God the Father! (<i>resting her head on his shoulder</i>) You're
so restful, Charlie. I feel as if I were a girl again and you were
my father and the Charlie of those days made into one. I wonder is
our old garden the same? We'll pick flowers together in the aging
afternoons of spring and summer, won't we? It will be a comfort to
get home--to be old and to be home again at last--to be in love
with peace together--to love each other's peace--to sleep with
peace together--! (<i>she kisses him--then shuts her eyes with a
deep sigh of requited weariness</i>)--to die in peace! I'm so
contentedly weary with life!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>with a serene peace</i>) Rest, dear Nina.
(<i>then</i> <i>tenderly</i>) It has been a long day. Why don't you
sleep now--as you used to, remember?--for a little while?</p>

<p>NINA--(<i>murmurs with drowsy gratitude</i>) Thank you,
Father--have I been wicked?--you're so good--dear old Charlie!</p>

<p>MARSDEN--(<i>reacting automatically and wincing with
pain--thinking mechanically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">God damn dear old &hellip; !</p>

<p>(<i>then with a glance down at Nina's face, with a happy
smile</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, God bless dear old Charlie &hellip;
who, passed beyond desire, has all the luck at last! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Nina has fallen asleep. He watches with contented eyes the
evening shadows closing in around them.</i>)</p>
