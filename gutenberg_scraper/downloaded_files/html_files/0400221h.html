<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">It has happened, times out of number, that in
mid-Africa, in India, in the deserts of Transjordan*&mdash;on an
ant-heap in the drought, or in the mud of the tropical rain&mdash;I
have felt a yearning for white lights, a dress suit and a tall silk
hat, that corresponds, I suppose, in some degree to the longing a
city man feels for those open spaces and far countries which it has
been my destiny to wander in and to write about. A traveler, if he
is wise, comes home at intervals to meet old friends and to remind
himself that a gentler, more conventional world exists, in which
events occur and problems arise, and in which delightful people
live and move and have their being.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Transjordan</i>&mdash;The Emirate of
Transjordan was an autonomous political division of the British
Mandate of Palestine, created as an administrative entity in April
1921 before the Mandate came into effect. It was geographically
equivalent to today's Kingdom of Jordan, and remained under the
nominal auspices of the League of Nations, until its independence
in 1946. Excerpted from <i><a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

<p>Writing books is only another phase of living
life&mdash;reliving it, perhaps, in which the appeal of the stiff
white shirt transforms itself into a desire to write "civilized"
stories. So this story, which is in an entirely different field
from my usual haunts in Africa and India, may be said to represent
a home-coming, between long journeys; and I hope the public, which
has followed me with such encouraging persistence to comparatively
unknown places, will concede that I still know how to behave myself
in a civilized setting.</p>

<p>But this story is no more mine than is the life of the big
cities into which I plunge at long, uncertain intervals. To Bradley
King, chief of the Thomas H. Ince staff of editors, belongs the
credit for the plot; her genius, art and imagination, and the
creative vision of my friend Thomas Ince combined to produce a plan
of narrative, now lavishly offered to the eye in a motion picture,
which appealed me so strongly that the impulse to transform it into
a written book was irresistible. The writing has been a delight to
me, and I trust it may prove as entertaining to the public.</p>

<p>Bradley King detected, tracked, ran down and caught the idea for
the story &mdash;a much more difficult thing to do than those who
have never hunted such elusive game will ever guess. She trained it
to perform; I wrote this book; and Mr. Ince has made the picture.
We hope the book will be accepted by the reader, as it was written,
purely to entertain; and that fellow newspaper men will recognize
the friendly and entirely sympathetic illustration of the way in
which the mighty and far-reaching power of the Press occasionally
is abused by individuals.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">CHAPTER 1.</a><br>
"A scene&mdash;a scandal&mdash;at church&mdash;<br>
on Easter Sunday of all days in the year&mdash;<br>
with nearly everybody in the county looking on!"</h2>

<p class="first">There is an hour of promise, and a zero hour; the
promise first; and promises are sometimes even sweeter than
fulfillment. Jacqueline Lanier was unconscious of her hour of
blossoming, and so the outlines of young loveliness had not been
hardened by habitual self-assertion. Since she came under Desmio's
care her lot had been cast in very pleasant places, and she was
aware of it, wondering a little now and then, between the thrills
of appreciation; but at seventeen we are not much given to
philosophy, which comes later in life when we are forced to try to
explain away mistakes.</p>

<p>She had come into the world a stormy petrel, but Consuelo and
Donna Isabella were the only ones who remembered anything of that,
and Consuelo took as much pains to obscure the memory as Donna
Isabella did in trying to revive it. Both women were acceptable
because everything whatever that belonged to Desmio was
perfect&mdash;must be. Jacqueline used to wonder what under heaven
Desmio could have to confess to on the occasions when he went into
the private chapel to kneel beside Father Doutreleau. She herself
had no such difficulties; there were always thoughts she had
allowed herself to think regarding Donna Isabella. It had cost
Jacqueline as much as fifty pater nosters on occasion for dallying
with the thought of the resemblance between Donna Isabella and the
silver-and-enamel vinegar cruet on the dining-room sideboard. And
there was always Consuelo, fruitful of confessions; for you
accepted Consuelo, listened to her comments, and obeyed
sometimes&mdash;exactly as might happen.</p>

<p>Consuelo presumably had been born middle-aged and a widow, and
so would remain forever, as dependable as the silvery Louisiana
moon that made the plantation darkies love-sick, and as the sun
that peeped in every morning between the window-sill and the lower
edge of the blind.</p>

<p>You brush your own hair at the convent, but that makes it no
less desirable to have it brushed for you at home during the Easter
Congé, especially if the hair grows in long dark waves like
Jacqueline's. At the convent you stand before a small plain mirror,
which in no way lessens the luxury of a chair at your own
dressing-table, in your own delightful room fronting on the patio
balcony, in Desmio's house, while Consuelo "fixes" you.</p>

<p>At the convent you wear a plain frock, all the girls dressed
alike; but that does not detract from the virtue of silken
underwear and lacy frocks at home.</p>

<p>"Hold your head still, Conchita!"</p>

<p>All Easter week Consuelo had been irritable, and Jacqueline's
blue eyes watched curiously in the mirror the reflection of the
duenna's plump face and the discontented set of the flexible mouth.
There was a new atmosphere about the house, and the whole
plantation vaguely re-suggested it, as if Desmio's indisposition
were a blight. Yet Desmio himself, and the doctor and Father
Doutreleau, and Consuelo had all been at pains to assure her that
the illness was nothing serious. True, Donna Isabella had dropped
ominous hints; but you could not take Donna Isabella's opinions
quite seriously without presupposing that there was nothing good in
the world, nor any use hoping for the best.</p>

<p>"Why are you worried, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>The critical lips pursed, and the expression reflected, in the
mirror became reminiscent of younger days, when a child asking
questions was discreetly foiled with an evasive answer.</p>

<p>"Because your hair is in knots, Conchita. At the convent they
neglect you."</p>

<p>"I am supposed to look after myself in the convent."</p>

<p>"Tchutt! There is no reason why they should teach you to neglect
yourself."</p>

<p>"They don't. The sisters are extremely particular!"</p>

<p>"Tchutt! They don't know what's what! It's a mystery to me they
haven't spoilt your manners&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;Consuelo!"</p>

<p>"Nobody can fool me. You'll never have to look after yourself,
Conchita &mdash;whoever says it!"</p>

<p>That was one of those dark sayings that had prevailed all week.
Jacqueline lapsed into silence, frowning; and that made Consuelo
smile, for as a frown it was incredible; it was just a ripple above
lake-blue eyes.</p>

<p>"You can't tell me!" exclaimed Consuelo, nodding to her own
reflection in the mirror as she put the last few touches to the now
decorously ordered hair. Next day's rearrangement at the convent
would fall short of this by a whole infinity.</p>

<p>"Can't tell you what, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>Pursed lips again. But the evasive answer was forestalled by a
knock on the door, and Jacqueline drew the blue dressing-robe about
her; for there was no doubt whose the knock was, and you never, if
you were wise, appeared in disarray before Donna Isabella. You
stood up naturally when she entered. As the door moved Consuelo's
face assumed that blank expression old servants must fall back on
when they dare not look belligerent, yet will not seem
suppressed.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline&mdash;"</p>

<p>Donna Isabella alone, in all that house, on all that plantation,
called her Jacqueline and not Conchita.</p>

<p>"&mdash;don't keep the car waiting."</p>

<p>Jacqueline glanced at the gilt clock on the dressing-table.
There was half an hour to spare, but she did not say so, having
learned that much worldly wisdom. She watched Donna Isabella's
bright brown eyes as they met Consuelo's. Consuelo left the
room.</p>

<p>Donna Isabella Miro stood still, looking like one of those old
engravings of Queen Elizabeth, until the door closed behind her
with a vicious snap in token of Consuelo's unspeakable opinion.</p>

<p>It was one of her characteristics that she kept you standing at
attention quite a while before she spoke.</p>

<p>She had her brother's features, lean and aquiline, almost her
brother's figure; almost his way of standing. Dressed in his
clothes, at a distance, she might even have been mistaken for him.
But there the resemblance ended. To Jacqueline, Don Andres Miro had
been Desmio ever since her three-year-old lips first tried to lisp
the name. It had been easiest, too, to say "Sabella," but at three
and a half the Donna had crept in, and remained. At four years it
had frozen into Donna Isabella, without the slightest prospect of
melting into anything less formal.</p>

<p>"I hope, Jacqueline, that in the days to come you will
appreciate how pleasant your surroundings were."</p>

<p>"Do I seem not to appreciate them, Donna Isabella?"</p>

<p>The older woman smiled&mdash;her brother's smile, with only a
certain thinness added, and an almost unnoticeable tightening of
the corners of the lips.</p>

<p>"I hope Don Andres' kindness has not given you wrong ideas."</p>

<p>"Donna Isabella, how could Desmio give anybody wrong ideas?
He's&mdash; he's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Words always failed when Jacqueline tried to say what she
thought of Desmio.</p>

<p>"He is absurdly generous. I hope he has not ruined you, as he
would have ruined himself long ago, but for my watchfulness."</p>

<p>"Ruined me? How could he?"</p>

<p>"By giving you wrong notions, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>"Wrong, Donna Isabella?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline had all her notions of life's meaning from Desmio.
His notions! None but Donna Isabella would have dreamed of calling
them by that name! They were ideals; and they were
right&mdash;right&mdash;right&mdash;forever right!</p>

<p>"Wrong notions about your future, Jacqueline.
Fortunately"&mdash;how fond she was of the word fortunately! "Don
Andres can never adopt you legally. There is no worse nonsense than
adopting other people's children to perpetuate a family name, and
we have cousins of the true stock."</p>

<p>Lanier blood is good, and Jacqueline knew it; but, as Consuelo
said, the convent had not spoiled her manners. She said
nothing.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;incredibly kind though Don Andres has been to
you&mdash;you have no claim on him."</p>

<p>The frown again&mdash;and a half-choke in the quiet voice;
"Claim? I'm grateful to him! He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>But words failed. Why try to say what Desmio was, when all the
world knew?</p>

<p>"Do you call it gratitude&mdash;after all he has done for
you&mdash; knowing what his good name and his position in the
country means to him &mdash;to make a scene&mdash;a
scandal&mdash;at church on Easter Sunday, of all days in the year,
with nearly everybody in the county looking on?"</p>

<p>"I made no scene, Donna Isabella."</p>

<p>"Jacqueline! If Don Andres knew that Jack Calhoun had walked up
the middle of the aisle during High Mass, and had given you an
enormous bouquet which you accepted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Should I have thrown the flowers into the aisle?" Jacqueline
retorted indignantly. "I put them under the seat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Accepted them, with half the county looking on!"</p>

<p>"I didn't want to make a scandal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you encouraged him!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline controlled herself and answered calmly, but the
incorrigible frown suggested mirth in spite of her and Donna
Isabella's lean wrists trembled with suppressed anger.</p>

<p>"I have always avoided him. He took that opportunity for lack of
a better, Donna Isabella."</p>

<p>"Can you imagine a young gallant bringing flowers to me during
High Mass?"</p>

<p>It was easy to believe that the whole world contained no gallant
brave enough for that effrontery! Her narrow face was livid with
malice that had seemed to increase since Desmio's illness.</p>

<p>"If Don Andres knew that for months Jack Calhoun&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me tell him!" urged Jacqueline. Her impulse had been to
tell him all about it long ago. He would have known the fault was
not hers, and would have given her good advice, instead of blaming
her for what she could not help; whereas Donna Isabella&mdash;</p>

<p>Donna Isabella stamped her foot.</p>

<p>"I forbid! You cause a scandal, but you never pause to think
what it will mean to those it most concerns! As if your name were
not enough, you drag in one of the Calhouns&mdash;the worst
profligates in Louisiana. The shock will kill him&mdash;I forbid
you to say a word!"</p>

<p>One learns obedience in convents.</p>

<p>"Put your frock on now, and remember not to keep the car
waiting. You can say good-by to Don Andres in the library, but
don't stay too long in there. He mustn't be upset. Try this once to
be considerate, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>There is virtue even in spitefulness, for it makes you glad when
people go, which is better after all than weeping for them.
Jacqueline's quick movement to open the door for Donna Isabella
failed to suggest regret. Consuelo's&mdash;for her hand was on the
door-knob on the far side&mdash; deliberately did not hint at
eavesdropping; she was buxom, bland, bobbing a curtsey to Donna
Isabella as she passed, and in haste to reach the closet where the
frocks hung in two alluring rows.</p>

<p>"The lilac frock, Conchita?"</p>

<p>Then the door closed, a pair of heels clip-clipped along the
balcony, and Consuelo's whole expression changed as instantly as
new moons change the surface of the sea. With a frock over her arm
she almost ran to Jacqueline, fondling her as she drew off the
dressing robe.</p>

<p>"What did she say, honey? Conchita&mdash;was she cruel? Was she
unjust?"</p>

<p>But at seventeen we are like birds, who sing when the shadow of
the hawk has passed, and Jacqueline's smile was
bright&mdash;invisible for a moment &mdash;smothered under a cloud
of lilac organdy.</p>

<p>"Careful, Consuelo! There's a hook caught in my hair!"</p>

<p>Whereat much petting and apology. Clumsy,
Consuelo&mdash;kindness crystallized&mdash;and adding injury to
insult! Consuelo self-abased:</p>

<p>"Mi querida&mdash;tell me&mdash;did she speak of that young
cockerel?"</p>

<p>There are some fictions we observe more carefully the more
opaque they are. Consuelo had been listening, and Jacqueline knew
it. The evasive answer works both ways.</p>

<p>"She said I must be quick, Consuelo."</p>

<p>Hats&mdash;a galaxy of hats&mdash;Consuelo would have had her
try on half a dozen, but Jacqueline snatched the first one and was
gone, as a young bird leaves the nest. Sunlight streamed into the
patio and touched her with vague gold as she sped along the
balcony. Down the wide stone stairs latticed shadows of the iron
railing produced the effect of flight, as if the lilac organdy were
wings. Then&mdash;for they teach you how to walk in convents
&mdash;across the courtyard between flowers and past the gargoyle
fountain toward Desmio's library, Jacqueline moved as utterly
unconscious of her charm as Consuelo, watching in the bedroom
doorway, was aware of it.</p>

<p>And something of the fear that she had seen in Don Andres' eyes
of late, clutched at the old nurse's heart. Lanier
beauty&mdash;Lanier grace&mdash; the Lanier heritage of sex
attraction&mdash;Jacqueline had them all. An exquisite tropical
butterfly, fluttering on life's threshold, unconscious of covetous
hands and covetous hearts that would reach out to possess her. What
lay ahead of those eager little feet?</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, take care of her!" she muttered&mdash;adding more
softly, "Poor Calhoun!" Then thoughts reverting to Donna
Isabella&mdash;"She would turn my honey-lamb out into the world!
Not while I live! Not while I have breath in me!"</p>

<p>But Jacqueline's only thought was Desmio. It banished for the
moment even the memory of Donna Isabella. We can be whole-hearted
at seventeen; emotions and motives are honest, unconcerned with
side-issues. She entered the library as she always did, frank and
smiling, glad to see him and have word with him, and as she stood
for a moment with the sunlight behind her in the doorway, he rose
to greet her. Father Doutreleau rose too, out of the depths of an
armchair, eager to persuade his friend to sit down again, but
neither priest nor physician lived who could persuade Don Andres to
forego courtesy.</p>

<p>"So you are on your way again, Conchita&mdash;and so soon!"</p>

<p>"It was your wish that I should attend the convent Desmio."</p>

<p>"How is the heart?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Yours, Conchita! You should know best!"</p>

<p>So he had always spoken to her. Never, from the day when
Consuelo carried her in under the portico, and Desmio had taken her
into his arms and keeping, had he ever treated her as less than an
equal, less than a comrade.</p>

<p>He was not more than middle-aged, but his hair and the grandee
beard were prematurely gray. Short lines about the corners of his
bright brown eyes hinted that to walk the earth with no dignity is
no way of avoiding trouble and responsibility. He sat in the
high-backed chair as one of his forebears might have sat to be
painted by Velasquez, and it called for no great power of
imagination to visualize a long rapier at his waist, or lace over
the lean, strong wrists. Yet, you were at ease in his presence.</p>

<p>"You will come to see me, Desmio?"</p>

<p>His answering smile was much more eloquent than if he had said
"of course." It implied that his indisposition was only temporary;
it mocked his present weakness, and promised improvement, asking no
more for himself than a moment's forbearance. If he had said wild
horses should not prevent him from visiting Jacqueline at the
convent, words would have conveyed less than the smile.</p>

<p>"I shall come to the convent to listen to the Sister Superior's
report of you&mdash;and shall return to Father Doutreleau to sit
through a sermon on pride!"</p>

<p>"Desmio, you are incorrigible."</p>

<p>"So says Father Doutreleau! The fault is yours, Conchita. How
shall I not be proud of you?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline leaned on the arm of the chair and kissed him, making
a little moue at Father Doutreleau, who sat enjoying the scene as
you do enjoy your patron's happiness. There was a world of
understanding in the priest's round face, and amusement, and
approval; better than most, he knew Don Andres' sheer sincerity; as
priest and family confessor, it was his right to approve the man's
satisfaction in such innocent reward. But it was the priest's face
that cut short the farewell. Jacqueline detected the swift movement
of his eyes, and turned to see Donna Isabella in the door.</p>

<p>"Consuelo is waiting for you in the car, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>Don Andres frowned. He disliked thrusts at Jacqueline. For a
moment his eyes blazed, but the anger died in habitual courtliness
toward his sister. Blood of his blood, she was a Miro and entitled
to her privileges.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Conchita," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>Jacqueline's hand, and Father Doutreleau's kept him down in the
chair, but he was on his feet the moment she had started for the
door. She glanced over her shoulder to laugh good-by to him, but
did not see the spasm of pain that crossed his face, or the
uncontrolled movement of the hand that betrayed the seat of pain.
She did not see Father Doutreleau leaning over him or hear the
priest's urging:</p>

<p>"Won't you understand you must obey the doctor?"</p>

<p>All Jacqueline heard was Donna Isabella's voice beside her, as
usual finding fault:</p>

<p>"Perhaps, while you are at the convent we may be able to keep
Don Andres quiet. At the convent try to remember how much you owe
to Don Andres' generosity, Jacqueline&mdash;and don't dally with
the notion that he owes you anything. Good-by."</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2">CHAPTER 2.</a><br>
"One may safely leave fond nurses<br>
to discover ways and means."</h2>

<p class="first">And so to the convent, with Donna Isabella's
farewell pleasantry not exactly ringing (nothing about that acid
personage could be said to ring, true or otherwise) but dull in her
ears. Consuelo did not help much, she was alternately affectionate
and fidgety beside her&mdash;fearful of Zeke's driving, and more
afraid yet of the levees, where the gangs were heaping dirt and
piling sand-bags against the day of the Mississippi's wrath.</p>

<p>Consuelo bemoaned the dignified dead days of well matched
horses. But, like everything else that was Desmio's, Jacqueline
loved the limousine. Stately and old-fashioned like its owner, it
was edged with brass, and high above the road on springs that
swallowed bumps with dignity. Desmio's coat-of-arms was embroidered
on the window-straps; and, if the speed was nothing to be marveled
at, and Zeke's driving a series of hair-breadth miracles, it had
the surpassing virtue that it could not be mistaken for anybody
else's car. Men turned, and raised their hats before they could
possibly have seen whether Desmio was within or not.</p>

<p>"You throw away your smiles, Conchita!"</p>

<p>"Should I scowl at them, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child! But if you look like an angel at every
jackanapes along the road, what kind of smile will you have left
for the right man, when the time comes&mdash;the Blessed Virgin
knows, that's why young Jack Calhoun&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jacqueline frowned.</p>

<p>"Mary, have pity on women!" she muttered half under her breath.
"I wish I might tell Desmio."</p>

<p>"Tchutt! You must learn for yourself, Conchita. Don Andres has
enough to trouble him."</p>

<p>The frown again. Learn for herself. In the convent they teach
you the graces; not how to keep at bay explosive lovers. Though he
had seized every opportunity for nearly a year to force himself on
her notice, she had never been more than polite to Jack Calhoun,
and she had been a great deal less than polite since she had grown
afraid of him.</p>

<p>Consuelo had studied that frown for seventeen years.</p>

<p>"You'll be safe from him in the convent, honey," she said,
nodding, and Jacqueline smiled.</p>

<p>But as they drove along the convent wall toward the old arched
gateway &mdash;the smile changed suddenly, and something kin to
fear&mdash; bewilderment at least&mdash;wonder, perhaps, that the
world could contain such awkward problems&mdash;brought back the
frown, as Consuelo clutched her hand.</p>

<p>"Look daggers at him, child!"</p>

<p>You can't look daggers with a face like Jacqueline's. That is
the worst of it. You must feel them first, and faces are the
pictured sentiments that we are born with, have felt, and wish to
feel. Not even at Jack Calhoun could she look worse than troubled.
And it needed more than trouble&mdash;more than Consuelo's
scolding&mdash;more than Zeke's efforts at the throttle and
scandalized, sudden manipulation of the wheel, to keep Jack Calhoun
at a distance. He had been waiting, back to the wall, twenty paces
from the gate, and came toward them sweeping his hat off gallantly.
One hand was behind him, but it would have needed two men's backs
to hide the enormous bouquet. Love &mdash;Calverly&mdash;Calhoun
brand, which is burning desire&mdash;was in eyes and
face&mdash;handsome face and eyes&mdash;lips a little too much
curled&mdash;chin far too impetuous&mdash;bold bearing, bridled
&mdash;consciousness of race and caste in every well-groomed inch
of him. He jumped on the running-board as Zeke tried vainly to
crowd him to the wall, and the bouquet almost choked the window as
he thrust it through.</p>

<p>"Miss Jacqueline&mdash;"</p>

<p>But a kettle boiling over on the stove was a mild affair
compared to Consuelo. She snatched the flowers and flung them
through the opposite window.</p>

<p>"There, that for you!" She snapped her fingers at him, and
Jacqueline learned what looking daggers means. "I know you
Calhouns! Be off with you!"</p>

<p>Jack Calhoun laughed. He liked it. Lambs in the fold are
infinitely more sweet than lambs afield. He loved her. He desired
her. So should a Calhoun's wife be, as unattainable as Grail and
Golden Fleece, that a Calhoun might prove his mettle in the
winning. He had a smile of approval to spare for Consuelo; her wet
cat welcome left him untouched, just as Jacqueline's embarrassment
only piqued his gallantry.</p>

<p>"Miss Jacqueline&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had a set speech ready. He had phrased and memorized it while
he waited. By the look of his horse, tied under a tree a hundred
yards away, he had been there for hours, and it was a pity that the
fruit of all that meditation should be nipped by the united efforts
of a Consuelo and a Negro coachman. But so it fell; for Zeke leaned
far out from the driver's seat and tugged at the big bell-handle by
the gate; and Consuelo, leaning her fat shoulder on the car door,
opened it suddenly, thrust herself through the opening and, forced
Jack Calhoun down into the dust.</p>

<p>"That much for you!" she exploded, and he laughed at her
good-naturedly; so that even Consuelo's angry brown eyes softened
for the moment. He had breeding, the young jackanapes, and the easy
airy Calhoun manners. She almost smiled; but she could afford it,
for the convent gate swung open and lay-sister Helena stepped out
under the arch to greet Jacqueline.</p>

<p>Jack Calhoun was balked, and realized the fact a second too
late. He ran around the limousine; but by the front wheel Zeke
blocked the way with the wardrobe trunk, and Jacqueline was already
exchanging with Sister Helena the kiss the convent rules
permitted.</p>

<p>Accept defeat at the hands of women and a Negro coachman, God
forbid! Jack Calhoun ran around the limousine again, jumped through
the door and out on the convent side, too quick for Consuelo, who
tried in vain to interpose her bulk.</p>

<p>"Miss Jacqueline&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Sister Helena drew Jacqueline over the threshold. That was
sanctuary. Not even a Calhoun would trespass there without leave;
and there were Zeke and Consuelo, beside ample lay-help near at
hand. Also, there was human curiosity &mdash;the instinct of the
woman who had taken vows, which in no way precluded interest in
another's love-affair.</p>

<p>"May I&mdash;won't you say good-by to me, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>Why not! What wrong in shaking hands at convent gates? Sister
Helena glanced at Consuelo, but Consuelo was inclined to pass
responsibility; her guardianship ended where the convent wall
began, and she was definitely frankly jealous of the sisters. She
looked vinegary, non-committal.</p>

<p>"It will be so long before I can see you again!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline shrank back for no clear reason, but instinctively.
There was a look in his eye that she did not understand. It
suggested vaguely things the convent teaching did not touch on,
except by way of skirting deftly around them with mysterious
warnings and dim hints. The wolf knows he is hungry. The lamb knows
she is afraid. The onlooker reckons a sheepfold or a convent wall
is barrier enough.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me good-by, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>She held out her hand, with the other arm around Sister Helena,
ashamed of her own reluctance. Why! By what right should she refuse
him common courtesy? He had never done a thing to her but pay her
compliments. Jack Calhoun crossed the threshold, seized her hand
and kissed it. She snatched the hand away,
embarrassed&mdash;half-indignant&mdash;still ignorant of
causes.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there&mdash;now you've had your way&mdash;be off
with you!" Consuelo thrust herself between them, back toward
Jacqueline and face to the enemy.</p>

<p>Calhoun backed away, hardly glancing at Consuelo, watching
Jacqueline over the fat black-satined shoulders. There was
acquisition in his eyes now &mdash;the look of the practiced hunter
whose time is not quite yet, but who has gauged his quarry's points
and weakness. Three paces back he bumped into Zeke with the trunk.
The trunk fell on his feet but he ignored it; if it hurt him, none
but he knew; Zeke's protestations fell on deaf ears. Midway between
gate and limousine he stood watching the trunk rolled in, and
Consuelo's wet- eyed leave-taking&mdash;watched Consuelo come away,
and saw the great gate slowly closing&mdash;watched like a hunter.
Then, with the gate half-shut, he caught Sister Helena's eye, and
the appeal in his made her pause. Hearts melt under dark-blue
habits easily. The gate re-opened by as much as half a foot,
disclosing Jacqueline again. Eyes met hers brimming full of
tenderness for Consuelo, who had said such foolishness as nurses do
say&mdash;tender, and then big with new surprise.</p>

<p>It was Jack Calhoun's heart leaping now. Had he won already? Was
she as glad as all that for another glimpse of him? The hot blood
rose to his temples, and the hot assurance to his lips. He would
have been no Calverly-Calhoun if he could keep that tide within
limits.</p>

<p>"I love you, Jacqueline&mdash;I love you!" he almost shouted.
Then the gate shut&mdash;tight. He heard the chain-lock rattle and
the key turn; and he laughed.</p>

<p>Consuelo's voice beside him brought him out of reverie.</p>

<p>"She's not for you&mdash;not for the likes of you!"</p>

<p>"Did you hear me say I love her, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>He was watching Consuelo's face, pondering how to turn an
adversary into a confederate, probing to uncover her weakness. She
being Consuelo, and he a Calverly-Calhoun, he was absolutely
certain to guess wrong as he was sure his guess would be
infallible.</p>

<p>Consuelo looked almost panic-stricken, and Jack Calhoun's lip
curled again in that heredity-betraying smile. He thought he saw
the joint in her armor. Old nurses, pension in view, may well dread
dismissal and the search for new employment. Doubtless Don Andres
would visit his wrath on Consuelo if he should think she had failed
in her task as duenna. He knew the Calhoun reputation and could
guess what Don Andres thought of it.</p>

<p>"I will call on Don Andres," he repeated.</p>

<p>"No, no!" She was almost imploring now. "Worry on Miss
Jacqueline's account would kill him! He is seriously ill. You
must&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What then," he interrupted. His hand went to his pockets, and
the offer of a bribe was plain enough if she would care to take
it.</p>

<p>"What then, Senor? Aren't you a Calhoun? Aren't you a
gentleman?"</p>

<p>He put his hands behind him&mdash;legs apart&mdash;head thrown
back handsomely. He had Consuelo at his mercy; he was sure of it;
and none ever accused the Calverly-Calhouns of being weakly
merciful.</p>

<p>"To oblige you, Consuelo, I'll say nothing to Don Andres at
present &mdash;provided you reciprocate."</p>

<p>"In what way, Senor?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "One may safely leave fond nurses to discover ways
and means," he answered. "Are letters mailed to young ladies at the
convent censored by the nuns?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Senor. What are you thinking of?"</p>

<p>"If you will smuggle in a letter to Miss Jacqueline, I will not
mention to Don Andres that you have permitted me more than one
interview with her. Otherwise,&mdash;my sentiments toward her being
what they are&mdash;you leave me no alternative."</p>

<p>For a second his eyes glanced away from Consuelo's. She
understood the glance; Zeke was listening. Jack Calhoun's smile
left his lips and crept into his eyes. Consuelo began to stammer
something, but he interrupted.</p>

<p>"I will write a letter to Miss Jacqueline. Tomorrow I will call
on Don Andres to inquire after his health. If you should meet me in
the patio, and take the letter, I will make no intimate disclosures
to Don Andres. Are we agreed?"</p>

<p>Consuelo bit her lip, and nodded.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow then&mdash;in the patio&mdash;shortly before noon.
Don't disappoint me!"</p>

<p>Consuelo could not trust herself to answer, but stepped into the
limousine, nodding to him a second time through the window. Words
would have choked her. Jack Calhoun, smiling as his father used to
smile when ships left port with contraband, gave Zeke a
fifty-dollar bill&mdash;checked the old darky's exclamations with a
gesture&mdash;waved the limousine on its way &mdash;and stood
watching until it was nearly out of sight. Then he went for his
horse and rode homeward at full gallop, using the spurs
unmercifully.</p>

<p>"My Jacqueline! My Jacqueline!" he sang as he rode. "I love her
and she's mine! My Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>The gangs mending a levee had to stop work and scatter to let
him pass. His horse knocked a man down, and a foreman cursed him
for it, calling him by name.</p>

<p>"Ye daren't get off that horse and act like a man! Ye're all
dogs, you Calhouns!"</p>

<p>Jack did not hesitate a second, but reined it and dismounted.
When he rode away five minutes later the foreman was a bruised and
bleeding wreck, unfit for work for a week to come.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">CHAPTER 3.</a><br>
"Andres, I have distressing news for you."</h2>

<p class="first">Consuelo, leaning back against the cushions in the
limousine, her fat bosom heaving as if she had run uphill, did not
dare trust herself to let a thought take shape for twenty minutes.
She could not have defined her own emotions.
Fury&mdash;indignation&mdash;fear for Jacqueline&mdash;contempt for
Zeke, who had accepted a bribe&mdash;an old nurse's faithful love,
that can be tigerish as well as sacrificing&mdash;a ghastly,
sinking sense of the dilemma facing her&mdash;and helplessness,
were all blended into one bewildering sensation. And through that
drummed the certainty that she, Consuelo, must do something about
it.</p>

<p>She knew that Don Andres loved Jacqueline with infinitely more
delight that he had loved his own daughter, whose resemblance to
Donna Isabella had been too obvious, even at the age of ten, to
stir paternal sympathies. Her death, leaving him with no direct
heir and a widower, had hurt his family pride more than his
affection, and it was not until Jacqueline entered his household
that his inmost heart was really touched. Jacqueline, at three, had
stepped into an empty place, and filled it. Spanish herself,
Consuelo knew the depths of Don Andres' distaste for public
scandal. Gossip and the name of Calverly-Calhoun were almost
synonymous terms. Gossip and Don Andres Miro were as fire and
water.</p>

<p>Zeke being nearest, was the first who must be dealt with. She
began at once:</p>

<p>"How much did he give you, Zeke?" she asked, sliding back the
glass panel behind the driver's seat.</p>

<p>Zeke attended to the driving thoughtfully for a good long minute
before he showed her the crow's-footed corner of an eye and a
silhouette of snub nose over pursed protruding lips.</p>

<p>"Didn't yo' see?"</p>

<p>He returned to his driving. His shoulders grew eloquent of
marvelous unconcern for Consuelo, or anything connected with
her.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;Zeke&mdash;why did he give it to you?"</p>

<p>Another minute's silence&mdash;then Zeke's eye, wide-open trying
to look around the corner of his head, and thick lips opened
impudently:</p>

<p>"He likes muh&mdash;don't you s'pose?"</p>

<p>Enough of Zeke. He would tell what he knew, or not tell, with or
without exaggerations, as Calhoun might instruct. Meanwhile, he
would use his own discretion, and by night the servants' hall would
have three versions of the affair, as surely as Zeke would have a
headache on the morrow. And by morning Donna Isabella would have
her own embittered version of the scandal.</p>

<p>Consuelo leaned back again against the cushions, thinking. Hers
was a lone hand. Somewhere midway between master and domestics,
with no clearly defined position in the household now that
Jacqueline was growing up, she had the distrust of both sides to
contend with. Insofar as she ever came in contact with Don Andres
he was kind and courteous to her, but Donna Isabella had taken care
to prevent confidential relations between master and nurse, and
pride kept Don Andres from interfering with his sister's authority
in the household. Yet she did not dare go to Donna Isabella and
take her into confidence. As well ask a she-wolf to be
sympathetic.</p>

<p>And she knew the Calverly-Calhouns&mdash;knew that Jack Calhoun
would hesitate at nothing. Worse still&mdash;the boy had brains. It
was likely enough to dawn on him that Donna Isabella was the key to
the situation. What was to prevent him from approaching her? And
what was more likely than that Donna Isabella would exaggerate the
scandal? Her jealousy knew no limits. She might succeed in
convincing Don Andres that marriage to Jack Calhoun was the only
way to prevent Jacqueline from becoming a subject of light gossip
of the countryside.</p>

<p>There was one way left then&mdash;deadly dangerous to herself.
She must go to Don Andres, and tell him everything. That thought
brought memories. Once&mdash;a year or two before the convent
days&mdash;there had been a governess, who had dared to approach
Don Andres with complaints about Donna Isabella's injustice to
Jacqueline. Of all insufferable indignities the one Don Andres
tolerated least was tale-bearing against those whom it pleased him
to honor, and the governess had left the house that night. She had
been young, with new positions open to her; Consuelo, well past
fifty, with about three hundred dollars in a savings bank, had no
delusions as to how the world would treat her, once dismissed. But
she thought of Jacqueline, and the little dancing frown above the
lake-blue eyes:</p>

<p>"Mother of God, protect me! I will tell Don Andres," she said,
half- aloud, as if afraid to hear her own voice. She crossed
herself, knelt in the limousine, and prayed.</p>

<p>She was dry-eyed&mdash;dry-lipped&mdash;businesslike, when the
limousine rolled under the portico and Zeke waited for her to climb
out as she pleased. Consuelo would have scolded him for it at any
other time, but she was in no mood for trivialities; great
resolution had her by the shoulders; she rang the old-fashioned
door-bell with a jerk and a clang that startled her. But they knew
it was only Consuelo, and the footman kept her waiting.</p>

<p>She heard his footsteps at last on the tiles, and heard him
pause in the hall, midway between patio and front door, where
dining-room and drawing-room opened off to the right and left. When
he came to the door his black face was a dumb enigma, and she saw
beyond him the figure of Donna Isabella, frowning sourly under the
drawing-room portière. She would have walked past with the usual
old-fashioned bobbing curtsey, but Donna Isabella stopped her:</p>

<p>"Why do you use the front door, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>Silence. Pursed lips. Attention.</p>

<p>"The fact that you are an old servant is no excuse for
forgetting your manners."</p>

<p>Consuelo's manners at that moment were a galleon's in full sail
down- wind. She had cut her cables&mdash;thrown away her
charts&mdash;was forth on life's last adventure.</p>

<p>Forget her manners? She dipped her pennant and sailed on,
leaving Donna Isabella to put what construction she might choose on
utter silence.</p>

<p>Straight to her own room. Off with her hat and cape, firm-lipped
and resolute&mdash;crossing herself before the image of the Virgin.
Out again, straight to the patio and toward the library.</p>

<p>Then, at the library door, sudden weak knees and emptiness. The
zero hour! She was keyed up for sacrifice; but what if it should be
in vain?</p>

<p>Her knuckles rapped the door&mdash;so hard that they hurt before
she could prevent them.</p>

<p>"Come!"</p>

<p>Too late! "O Mother of God, put courage into me, and words into
my mouth! I don't know what to say to him "</p>

<p>The door was shut behind her, and she was midway across the
room, hardly knowing how it had happened. Don Andres was in the
high-backed chair, laying down a book, his other lean, long, veined
hand resting on the chair-arm.</p>

<p>"What is it, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, all fear and all discretion to the winds! Words
came &mdash;from somewhere&mdash;sounding to Consuelo like another
woman's speaking in a voice she hardly knew.</p>

<p>"Don Andres&mdash;have I been a good servant to you?"</p>

<p>"I have always thought so, Consuelo."</p>

<p>He was too courteous to seem surprised. His eyes looked kind,
not critical. How could it be that such a man had enemies? Consuelo
dropped on her knees on the floor beside the footstool, clasping
her hands on her bosom.</p>

<p>"Don Andres&mdash;I come to you as your servant now! I mean no
harm to any one, and if I offend you, dismiss me and I will go in
silence. Only hear me to the end first!"</p>

<p>"You may tell me what is in your mind, Consuelo."</p>

<p>"Don Andres&mdash;it is about Miss Jacqueline&mdash;Mr. Jack
Calhoun is making love to her. He made a scene at the convent gate,
and I could not keep him away from her, although I tried!"</p>

<p>He nodded, looking grave. He was perfectly sure how faithfully
Consuelo would have tried.</p>

<p>"He made a scene at church on Easter Sunday."</p>

<p>Don Andres frowned.</p>

<p>"Why has Jacqueline not told me of all this?"</p>

<p>"She was forbidden&mdash;she wished to, Don Andres,&mdash;she
was forbidden months ago to tell you anything."</p>

<p>"Did you advise her not to tell me?"</p>

<p>"God forbid! Don Andres, that innocent has never had another
secret from you. As God is my witness, there is nothing in her life
until this, that you did not know."</p>

<p>He nodded again. There was only one other individual in the
household who might have imposed restraint. But his nod was in
recognition of Consuelo's tact in not mentioning the individual's
name.</p>

<p>"Does she respond to Mr. Calhoun's attentions?"</p>

<p>"She fears him, Don Andres! What does she know of men? She
shrinks away from him, and he pursues her! She does not understand.
She only knows there is something that she doesn't understand. He
fascinates her&mdash;he has made up his mind&mdash;he is set on
winning her&mdash;and&mdash;Don Andres&mdash;you know those
Calverly-Calhouns!"</p>

<p>He overlooked the last part of her speech. The Calverly-Calhouns
for generations had been his equals.</p>

<p>"Have you had speech with him with reference to this?" he asked
after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>So Consuelo told him all that Jack Calhoun had said, and of the
bribe to Zeke, and of her own unspoken promise to meet Jack Calhoun
in the patio next day and take a letter from him. She stammered
over the last part, for she had not been in that household fourteen
years without knowing the master's method with servants who
consented to intrigue. His deep frown frightened her &mdash;it was
only a matter of moments now.</p>

<p>"Stand up, Consuelo," he said at last, and she struggled to her
feet, biting her lip, awaiting her dismissal.</p>

<p>"Did he offer you money?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think he dared, Don Andres."</p>

<p>"You agreed to smuggle his letter into the convent?"</p>

<p>"Don Andres&mdash;what else could I dot?&mdash;I haven't the
power to manage him otherwise&mdash;I'm an old woman, and he laughs
at me&mdash; unless he thinks he can use me he'll go to&mdash;to
some one else&mdash;and they'll make a scandal between them
to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The nod again&mdash;cryptic&mdash;dry. The dark eyes deadly
serious. A too long pause, as if he were unmercifully framing
words. The thin lips tightly set.</p>

<p>"You were always a good servant, Consuelo."</p>

<p>Were! So the end had come. Her heart sank, for the awaited is
not less terrible when it arrives. She bowed her head, remembering
she would go in silence.</p>

<p>"I am not ungrateful for good service, or unconscious of my
obligation to reward it. You may leave that part to me. But I will
tolerate no insubordination in my house. You understand me?"</p>

<p>She did not. She looked hurt now&mdash;amazed. She had never
been insubordinate. A little of the meekness left her: She would
not go in silence after all. She would tell him to his face what a
faithful servant suffered constantly at Donna Isabella's
lips&mdash;how much had to be endured for his sake&mdash;she would
seize an old woman's privilege of speech and pour out all she knew!
But he spoke again before she could begin and even in that moment
of indignation she could not force herself to interrupt him.</p>

<p>"You must continue as if this interview with me had never taken
place. You understand?"</p>

<p>Slowly his meaning dawned on her.</p>

<p>"Am I not dismissed?" she asked, her face reddening.</p>

<p>He ignored the question. "There must be no impudence or
disobedience. No dark looks, Consuelo. No suggestion of an
understanding with me behind another's back. No Spying. No tales to
me. No indignities to&mdash;any one."</p>

<p>Consuelo bobbed her old-fashioned curtsey. Words would have been
empty in the presence of that magnificent consistency. For his
pride's sake she would let Donna Isabella drive nails into
her&mdash;poison her&mdash;malign her &mdash;and she would say
nothing! Followed emotion, making the stout bosom nearly burst the
black satin bodice. Tears. Smothered, sobs into a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that will do." He loathed anything undignified. "I
will ask Donna Isabella to excuse you from duty until tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>Consuelo went without another word. Don Andres did not pick up
the book again but sat staring into
vacancy&mdash;alone&mdash;dismally lonely, and too proud to admit
it even to himself. The house, and his whole life, were empty
without Jacqueline. She was all the brightness he had ever known
and to send her to school at the convent was his master-sacrifice.
He broke into a smile as he thought of her, and the smile died away
into a swordsman's frown, teeth showing through the parted lips, as
he remembered stage by stage the fight he had waged for her&mdash;a
memory that Consuelo's news had only sharpened. So an affair with
Jack Calhoun was to be the next difficulty! He wondered how deeply
Isabella was already mixed in it.</p>

<p>Well he understood his sister Isabella. She had opposed his
determination to accept the child's guardianship; and that failing,
she had tried to wean Jacqueline away from him and make her a
dried-up image of herself&mdash;even as she had succeeded in doing
with his own only child. But his own child had been a Miro. He did
not disguise from himself that the Miro blood was dying&mdash;the
direct Miro line near its end. Isabella had succeeded with that
daughter of his; the weak twig of an ancient tree had come easily
under her sway, had wilted under it, and died. But nothing in
Jacqueline's nature had provided Isabella any thing to work on.
Rather she responded to his own lavished affection and Consuelo's
mothering; and that had given Isabella deeper offense than the
original crime of introducing the child into the household.</p>

<p>He had made up for Isabella's bitterness, by giving Jacqueline
every advantage and every privilege within his means. And the means
of the Miros in Louisiana are beyond the scope of most men's
dreams.</p>

<p>So the house was lonely now Jacqueline was at the
convent&mdash;felt like a tomb, for all its decorous luxury. Don
Andres Miro, possibly the best loved, certainly the richest and
most respected among the old Louisiana Settlers, felt like a man
with no occupation left. He was much too proud to feel sorry for
himself; he would have smiled if run through with a rapier. But
pride heals no heart-ache&mdash;fills no empty nest.</p>

<p>And Calverly-Calhoun? He knew that breed! No scion of that stock
for Jacqueline! He had intimately known two generations of
Calhouns, and could guess the hourly anguish of the women they had
married. Good women don't reform bad men, they only irritate them;
he knew that. He would rather, if necessary, see Jacqueline married
to some young fellow without family, but of decent means and good
repute, who would know enough to appreciate her and treat her with
respect. But there was fortunately no hurry about that, and only
need for vigilance. Meanwhile&mdash;</p>

<p>He would have one more try&mdash;if necessary he would call in
the United States Attorney-General himself&mdash;to find some flaw
in the Miro trust deed. If, subject to provision for his sister
Isabella, he might leave by will the whole of his estates to
Jacqueline, then&mdash;</p>

<p>Again the proud smile. That would be a true gift given from the
heart &mdash;the reply complete to Isabella&mdash;and, by no means
the least amusing part of it, a full expression of contempt for
John Miro, his distant cousin, now heir legal and presumptive,
whose Lynn shoe-factory was a disgrace and scandal to the Miro
name. If by any legal means it might be possible, he would bequeath
to Jacqueline every last acre and investment of the Miro
fortune.</p>

<p>To that end he must preserve his health. It was important that
he should have his wits about him and the strength to see possible
law-suits to a conclusion; for it was no part of his determination
to leave a mere document behind him, over which and his dead body
Jacqueline should have to fight the gum shoe-maker. She would have
no chance unless, he, Andres Miro, should do the fighting for her.
He would do that, bitter though he knew the fight might be.</p>

<p>The difficult days, he recognized, were coming. All that lay
behind was child's-play compared to the road ahead. Obstruct
Calhoun and there would be other suitors to be fenced with. When a
rumor should creep abroad, as it inevitably must, that the estates
might fall to Jacqueline, every needy adventurer on the countryside
would add his importunities to the confusion. Then more than ever
Jacqueline would need his comradeship and guidance. He must throw
the weight of years aside, and attend to it that his company should
be a pleasure to her and not a burden. To that end, he must resume
his youth and be more spirited and companionable than any of the
young bloods she should meet. Well&mdash;he considered that not
impossible. Only he must get well. A man needs health before he can
be young again; and doctors&mdash;he did not know how much faith to
place in even his family physician; the man never seemed to know
his own mind&mdash;but then, the Miros were ever a long-lived
breed. Why theorize about disease, when long life was hereditary
fact?</p>

<p>His reverie was interrupted by Father Doutreleau who came and
went in that house pretty much as his own pleasure dictated. He was
as close to Andres on the one hand as Jacqueline was on the other,
so that apart altogether from his office of confessor, François
Doutreleau was intimate in Miro's councils, knew his secrets, and
was one of the three men who discussed them with him.</p>

<p>"Forgive me if I remain seated, François. It's your own
medicine! Ring the bell, won't you, and we'll have some wine
brought in."</p>

<p>There was wine enough in the Miro cellar to last another
generation, and it was normal routine to have sherry and biscuits
served in the library on afternoons when Miro was home. As a rule
Doutreleau looked forward to it; his well filled figure and
declining years responded gratefully to Old-World hospitality, and
he knew good wine. But on this occasion he showed less than his
usual satisfaction, and a hesitation that was rare with him. When
Andres had filled two glasses, Doutreleau merely raised his glass
and set it down untasted.</p>

<p>"What is new, François? Have you seen the papers?"</p>

<p>"Andres, I have distressing news for you. Be a brave man, and
prepare yourself."</p>

<p>Doutreleau swallowed his wine at a gulp then. He had crossed the
Rubicon.</p>

<p>"I trust it is not distressing to yourself, François. If it
concerns me alone I shall find a way to bear it."</p>

<p>"It concerns us all. Andres&mdash;Doctor Beal has been to see
me."</p>

<p>"I can well imagine your distress! The man has bored me with his
platitudes for thirty years! Has he said you are too fat? I
disagree with him. Take courage, François, and be comfortable. I am
lean, and I assure you it has disadvantages."</p>

<p>"Andres, he has told me what he had not the courage to tell
you."</p>

<p>"Pusillanimity! However&mdash;I myself have often confessed to
you, François, sins that I would detest to have to tell the
world."</p>

<p>"He spoke of you, Andres."</p>

<p>"And that distressed you, François! Take some more sherry.
Choose a livelier subject for discussion next time!"</p>

<p>He understood there was genuinely bad news coming, and he
prepared to meet it as he would meet death, or any other evil,
proudly&mdash;conceding it no right to disturb his outer
dignity.</p>

<p>"Andres, he has told me you have not long to live."</p>

<p>Not a flinch. Not a tremor of the steady eyelids. Not a moment's
relaxation of the smile; rather it increased, and grew
kindlier.</p>

<p>"So you were distressed to hear that of me, my friend? I am
grateful for the compliment. Did Beal in his omniscience set the
date of termination of my mortal activities?"</p>

<p>"He gives you a few months, Andres. Possibly a year."</p>

<p>"I hope he doesn't think I suspect him of malpractice! Assure
him, I am convinced he has done his best!"</p>

<p>"Andres, I admire your courage. But to Jacqueline&mdash;to your
household and dependents&mdash;to the parish&mdash;to
myself&mdash;this is disaster. Won't you promise me to do all in
your power to remain with us as long as possible? Won't you obey
Beal? Won't you let him call in specialists? I want your promise,
Andres, as friend to friend."</p>

<p>For a full minute Miro did not answer. When he spoke at last his
voice was normal, suggesting no echo of battles going on within
him.</p>

<p>"I would prefer to exact a promise from you first,
François."</p>

<p>"Name it, my friend. If it is anything permissible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, none of the deadly sins! Promise to keep this news a
secret, and to impress on Beal the same obligation."</p>

<p>"For myself, of course, I promise. But Beal will want to call in
the specialists, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let Beal be answerable for their silence. Impress that on
him."</p>

<p>"Then you will see the specialists?"</p>

<p>"On that condition, yes. But not in this house, or there would
be talk about it. Let Beal arrange for me to visit them."</p>

<p>François Doutreleau rose, turning his back to Miro, and then,
still keeping his face averted, went behind Miro's chair, where he
laid his hand on the iron-gray head that he had blessed so often,
but never before so fervently.</p>

<p>"Brother&mdash;my friend&mdash;" he began, but his voice choked
and he could not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>Miro reached upward for the fat hand and drew it down to the
chair-arm.</p>

<p>"I am proud of our friendship, François, although I am unworthy
of it," he said in a steady voice; but he did not look up at the
priest. "We shall be making an indecorous exhibition of ourselves
unless we're careful. Would you care to leave me for a while to
think this out alone? Suppose you take dinner with us? After dinner
we can talk again."</p>

<p>Doutreleau walked to the door, saying a prayer under his breath,
and Miro watched him, still smiling,&mdash;until the priest turned
at the door.</p>

<p>"You will dine with us tonight then, François?"</p>

<p>Doutreleau nodded, for he could not trust himself to speak, and
left the room.</p>

<p>Then, with no witnesses, Don Andres Miro sat at bay, looking
death and its full consequences in the eyes. Little by little it
dawned on him what his death would mean to Jacqueline. He had given
so much thought to caring for her that his mind refused at first to
readjust itself, and for a while he still thought of her as his
ward, his heart's darling, whose destiny was in his keeping.</p>

<p>So this was the end of his plans! It might need years to engage
the best legal talent in the land and force through the courts a
new trust deed that should settle the estates on Jacqueline! If
Beal was right, in a year at most the gum shoe-maker would be in
possession, and Jacqueline at the mercy of the world and Isabella,
with a few paltry thousands in cash to make her an even choicer
prey for wolves.</p>

<p>He had raised her in exquisite luxury, and his death now would
plunge her helpless and unprotected into the world he had prevented
her from understanding!</p>

<p>What had he taught her, except gentleness and goodness?
Nothing&mdash; unless pride, that would make her suffer in silence.
He supposed that Consuelo perhaps might have told her things that a
mother usually tells a young girl, but he rather doubted it, he had
said nothing to Consuelo about that, and she was not given to
taking liberties.</p>

<p>Haggard and worn&mdash;older than he had ever seemed&mdash;he
leaned back in the chair and faced the facts&mdash;then suddenly
grew resolute again. He was a Miro. He had months to live! The fire
returned into his eye&mdash;the Miro heritage&mdash;the stubbornly
resourceful Miro spirit that had never confessed defeat, nor ever
yielded to a lesser force than Providence. Had he wronged
Jacqueline? Then he had will to set the matter right, and time in
which to think.</p>

<p>He thanked God that he saw the wrong before it was altogether
too late. He was ready to flinch from nothing. Somehow, by some
means, Jacqueline should not be loser by his guardianship; he,
Andrew Miro, would attend to that, and then die cheerfully.</p>

<p>But how? Isabella could be absolutely counted on to thwart
whatever plans he might make; he could not take Isabella into
confidence. He could provide a moderate sum of money out of cash in
hand, and deliver it to a trustee, to be paid to Jacqueline after
his death; but the income from it would be no more than a pittance,
and Jacqueline would be almost as unprotected as before.
Nevertheless; that was something nothing like enough, but he would
do that first.</p>

<p>He could make good provision for Consuelo, on condition that she
keep watch over Jacqueline. But Consuelo's influence would wane as
Jacqueline grew older, and, besides, he could hardly expect a
spirited girl to submit forever to the dictates of an old nurse. To
an extent, too, that would imply indignity to Jacqueline.</p>

<p>She was worthy of dignity&mdash;fitted by breeding and character
to be heiress of the Miro fortune and estates. Yet he could not
make her that, unless&mdash;unless&mdash;</p>

<p>There came another, new light in his eyes. He sat
bolt-upright&mdash; smiled. The invisible, long rapier again. He
hardly resembled a sick man, but a great adventurer, when the
library door opened and Donna Isabella looked in, even more sourly
than her wont. He rose with his usual courtesy to greet her.</p>

<p>"No wonder this house lacks discipline and the servants give
themselves airs!" she grumbled.</p>

<p>"Surely nothing has displeased you, Isabella!"</p>

<p>"Something seems to have pleased you!" she retorted. "It will be
dinner time in ten minutes, Andres, and you sit there grinning to
yourself like a lunatic. How can you expect a well ordered
household, when the master is late for his meals? Is it fair to
me!"</p>

<p>Don Andres smiled without a visible trace of sarcasm, and bowed
to her cavalierly as he left the room.</p>

<p>Donna Isabella nodded after him, thin lipped and exasperated.
She would have liked him much better if he had turned on her and
shown ill-temper.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">CHAPTER 4.</a><br>
"Come now. Listen to me, Consuelo."</h2>

<p class="first">"No disobedience! No insubordination! No
indignities to any one!"</p>

<p>Consuelo went about her duties with those all too definite
limitations humming in her head. All morning long Donna Isabella
invented aggravating tasks, as if with the deliberate intention to
force rebellion. All her efforts were unsatisfying; weariness was
dubbed unwillingness; silent endurance was the sulks; a breathless
answer was impertinence.</p>

<p>And it neared noon. Jack Calhoun was coming. Consuelo had made
up her mind to get that letter from Jack Calhoun and to take it
straight in to Don Andres. There would be no insubordination about
that. Don Andres thereafter could take any course he pleased about
it, and surely not even Donna Isabella could accuse her of
remissness or intrigue.</p>

<p>But the worst of it was that Donna Isabella had a chair set in
the patio, not far from the front hall, whence she could oversee
everything, and Consuelo could think of no excuse for getting
between her and the front door.</p>

<p>At last in desperation she suggested putting fresh flowers in
the drawing- room.</p>

<p>"Always some excuse for being lazy!" snorted Donna Isabella. "Go
and change the curtains on the bedroom windows."</p>

<p>No disobedience! No insubordination! But what were the Blessed
Virgin and the saints all doing? Consuelo, with aching thighs,
mounted the stairs to the balcony, and from one of the bedroom
windows watched Jack Calhoun come cavaliering in to pay his
compliments. She was not surprised that Donna Isabella should
receive him courteously; Zeke had already disgorged his several
versions of the scene at the convent gate, and Donna Isabella was
no fool, to begin by snubbing a man who might help her to be rid of
Jacqueline; she invited young Calhoun to sit beside her. Consuelo
saw him glance repeatedly to right and left, and knew what he was
looking for, but she could not make him see her at the bedroom
window, though she prayed to at least a dozen saints to make him
look upward, instead of around.</p>

<p>And, as Consuelo had admitted to herself, young Jack Calhoun had
brains.</p>

<p>He was a man of his word, of course, but he had not promised to
say nothing to Donna Isabella. He and Donna Isabella sat
considering each other while he made polite inquiries about Miro's
health; and he made a much better guess at her character than he
had done at Consuelo's. In turn Donna Isabella summed him up
perfectly. He was the necessary man headstrong, handsome, with a
fortune not yet squandered.</p>

<p>"Don Andres is not well enough to see you. Have you any
particular message for him?" she asked; and something in her bright
eyes suggested expectation. He did not hesitate.</p>

<p>"Is he too ill for me to talk to him about Miss Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"You may talk to me."</p>

<p>He proved a fluent talker, without convincing Donna Isabella in
the least. But jealousy will hesitate no more than passion does, to
gain its end.</p>

<p>"What chance have I?" he asked her finally.</p>

<p>"None, if you go to Don Andres and ask him."</p>

<p>"I am asking you."</p>

<p>"That is different. You say that she reciprocates your
feelings?"</p>

<p>"My God! I believe so. Donna Isabella, I can see her eyes
now&mdash; innocent and pure and wonderful! I said good-by to her
at the convent gate. I kissed her hand.</p>

<p>And she stood watching me as I went, with her eyes full of
love&mdash;My God! Donna Isabella, I would go through fire for
Jacqueline! Her eyes haunt me!"</p>

<p>"Consuelo, of course, permitted you to talk with her?"</p>

<p>For a second his eyes met Donna Isabella's in a flash of
scrutiny as swift as pistol-fire. The Calverly-Calhouns are born
quick on the trigger.</p>

<p>"Aha! Yes. She's diplomatic, Consuelo is. I'm told the nuns read
love- letters, and that's not decent&mdash;no more decent than it
would be for me to employ Consuelo with out your knowledge. I have
hopes of Consuelo's stocking, however, if you've no absolute
objection! Of course, I give you my word I wouldn't put anything
into a letter to Jacqueline that shouldn't pass a reasonable
censor&mdash;but you know what nuns are."</p>

<p>Donna Isabella smiled&mdash;a wee bit mischievously, as old
ladies may who are asked to forward love-affairs.</p>

<p>"What do you think Don Andres would say, if he heard I ever
contemplated permitting anything of the sort?"</p>

<p>"Who cares what he'd say as long as he doesn't know?" Calhoun
answered with one of his contagious laughs. "Come now, Donna
Isabella, you were young once, and I'll bet you've been in love!
Haven't I been frank with you? Aren't you going to lend a pair of
surreptitious wings to Cupid? Jack Calhoun's your worshiper for
ever more if you'll help him this once!"</p>

<p>"Don Andres would never forgive me."</p>

<p>"No need. He'll never know."</p>

<p>"Have you brought the letter with you?"</p>

<p>He produced it, and Consuelo, watching through the bedroom
window, saw it change hands. Donna Isabella sat still for several
minutes, turning it over and over in her fingers.
Fascinated&mdash;unable to wrench her gaze away &mdash;Consuelo saw
the library door open, and then close again, as if Don Andres had
seen, or overheard, and, after deciding to interrupt, had changed
his mind.</p>

<p>Donna Isabella heard the movement of the door, and took the
hint. The letter went into her bosom. Jack Calhoun received his
congé and was shown out by the footman. Donna Isabella went to the
drawing-room, which Andres never visited if he could invent excuse
for staying away, and five minutes later the footman came in search
of Consuelo. On her way across the patio she passed Don Andres, but
he gave her no inkling whether he knew what was going on or not.
Nevertheless, the sight of him encouraged her.</p>

<p>Donna Isabella, seated in shadow in the drawing-room, kept
Consuelo waiting with the sun in her face for several minutes
before she condescended to speak at last.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by permitting Mr. Calverly-Calhoun to speak to
Miss Jacqueline on her way to the convent?"</p>

<p>Consuelo did not answer. If she had spoken she would have
rebelled; she held her tongue by a miracle.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to say? What do you mean by spying through a
bedroom window all the time I was talking to Mr.
Calverly-Calhoun?"</p>

<p>Absolute silence. No answer was possible, unless Consuelo chose
to deny the fact or to be openly insolent. She would do neither.
She merely hung on &mdash;clung to her faith in Don Andres and
stood there, looking almost as miserable as she felt.</p>

<p>"If Don Andres were not so ill, I would report you to him."
Donna Isabella paused between her sentences like an inquisitor
selecting new implements of torture. "You have been careless and
unfaithful. If Don Andres knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>Consuelo bit her lip&mdash;on the verge of rebellion&mdash;or
tears, she hardly knew which.</p>

<p>"&mdash;but he must not know, for the present. Now you needn't
look sullen at me; I am not going to discharge you."</p>

<p>Another pause&mdash;another long keen scrutiny. And then:</p>

<p>"I understand that you promised Mr. Calverly-Calhoun to take a
letter to Miss Jacqueline."</p>

<p>No answer, but a little jerkily defiant nod. Donna Isabella had
a definite purpose behind the morning's course of cruelty; she was
demanding tears as evidence of good faith. Better for Consuelo to
break down and have done with it!</p>

<p>"If you were not an old and trusted servant I would deal more
harshly with you. Are you not ashamed to have so abused the
confidence we have always placed in you?"</p>

<p>Donna Isabella was as near the end of her resources now as
Consuelo was. Unless Consuelo were humbled, repentant, ashamed, she
could not use her. She was growing really angry, but disguised it
with an effort, forcing her voice to seem almost kind.</p>

<p>"I should have though that after all these years your affection
for Miss Jacqueline would have been more faithful."</p>

<p>That did it! It was anger, but it served. Poor Consuelo burst
into tears of
indignation&mdash;rage&mdash;contempt&mdash;rebellion; flung
herself on her knees and buried her face in an armchair. And Donna
Isabella, smiling to herself, put her own interpretation on it
all.</p>

<p>"There, there now, Consuelo. If you're sorry, I'll forgive
you."</p>

<p>Sorry? Consuelo? She bit the chair to keep brimstone Spanish
execration in.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Consuelo. If you're sorry it can possibly be
mended. Sit up now and listen to me."</p>

<p>Never&mdash;not once in fourteen years&mdash;had Donna Isabella
spoken half so kindly, and it enraged Consuelo all the more, for
she was not an animal, to be first beaten and then tamed. But her
natural Spanish shrewdness came to her rescue. Donna Isabella must
need something and need it badly. So Consuelo went on sobbing.</p>

<p>"Come now, Consuelo. Sit up and stop crying, and we'll see what
can be done."</p>

<p>Tears&mdash;idle tears&mdash;and rapt attention! Hands over
ears, but lots of room between Consuelo's fingers to let words
filter through!</p>

<p>"The harm's done now. We must make the best of it. Above all, in
his present state of health, we must keep any scandal from Don
Andres."</p>

<p>Nothing new about that! So another paroxysm of sobs and moans,
interpreted by Donna Isabella as signs of panicky fear of her
brother. She permitted herself another of her thin rare smiles.</p>

<p>"Come now, listen to me, Consuelo." She need not have worried.
Consuelo was all ears. "You have promised to take the letter. We
can't break promises, especially when they're made to people of the
standing of Mr. Calverly-Calhoun. Besides, if you don't take the
letter, I'm afraid he'll grow impetuous and perhaps do something we
would all regret."</p>

<p>An old servant is either a consummate actress, or out of work.
Consuelo let herself come slowly out of the weeping spell,
consenting to sit on a chair at last, but using tears and
handkerchief enough to hide her real emotion. So it was as simple
as all that! She could have laughed into the handkerchief! Jack
Calhoun had seen the key to Jacqueline and seized it &mdash;had he?
Had he? Did Donna Isabella really think she could hoodwink an old
nurse?</p>

<p>"We can't expect a young girl like Jacqueline not to lose her
head over her first love-affair, Consuelo. You may take her the
letter, but you must talk to her and warn her not to do anything
rash."</p>

<p>More handkerchief. So that was it! She was to take a letter to
turn a poor innocent's head, and then put thoughts of rashness into
the same young head by preaching against it.</p>

<p>"I am agreeing to this, as much as anything to save your face,
Consuelo."</p>

<p>The face went into the handkerchief, red and confused.</p>

<p>"I am going to count on you to be extremely circumspect and
tactful."</p>

<p>Quite right. Depend on it! Consuelo nodded vehemently over the
handkerchief, both hands holding it tightly to her face.</p>

<p>"You must impress on Miss Jacqueline the absolute necessity for
keeping all this from Don Andres. He would be furious, and the
shock might kill him."</p>

<p>More nods. Consuelo's black chignon bobbed to and fro like the
top-knot on a mechanical mandarin.</p>

<p>"You must contrive to manage this without a scandal. Of course,
when Don Andres learns that Miss Jacqueline is in love with Mr.
Calhoun, he will give his consent, I suppose. I don't see how he
can withhold it after all this clandestine business. So distasteful
to him, Consuelo. I'm surprised you didn't think of that before you
let it go so far. However, now it's too late to remedy that, we
must consider Miss Jacqueline, and not break her heart as well as
his. My own heart was broken at a very early age, Consuelo. It was
the fault of my parents. They interfered, exactly as Don Andres
would be likely to. I could not endure to see Jacqueline's heart
broken as mine was, and her whole life blighted."</p>

<p>More tears into the handkerchief; then at last orderly, dutiful,
controlled words, cautiously emitted between sobs:</p>

<p>"I will be careful and obedient, Donna Isabella!"</p>

<p>Truthful Consuelo! Careful! She would fight to keep young
Calverly- Calhoun away from Jacqueline as she-wolf never fought for
cub! Obedient? Watch her! She would take the letter&mdash;to the
convent! She was jealous of the convent sisters&mdash;Yes, she
would certainly take the letter.</p>

<p>"When, Donna Isabella?"</p>

<p>"Next week, when Don Andres sends the usual flowers and candy
will be time enough."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">CHAPTER 5.</a><br>
"Put not your trust in princes, Jacqueline."</h2>

<p class="first">There were hours, especially during the first few
days after her return, when it seemed to Jacqueline that in the
convent she had Desmio for her very own even more than when she was
under his roof and able to see him constantly. For in the convent
there was no Donna Isabella to make acrid comments and to interrupt
her day-dreams with bitter fault-finding.</p>

<p>From the Sister Superior down to the darky gardener, they all
knew Desmio and loved him. He had left his imprint on the
place&mdash;windows for instance, in the chapel, and the big bronze
bell. And he had promised to come to see her, so there was always
that to look forward to, which took the drag out of routine.</p>

<p>Not that the life was irksome; far from it. Don Andres being her
guardian and sponsor, Jacqueline received no definitely better
treatment than the other girls, except that she was one of the few
who had a single bedroom; but there was always an indefinite, and
very pleasant suggestion that much was expected of her.</p>

<p>There was no loneliness; almost never a moment's solitude. No
girls were allowed to wander alone, or even in pairs, among the
trees and well shrubbed acres within the wall, there was always a
sister in attendance on every group, whose presence grew to seem as
natural as did the absence of anything really reprehensible.</p>

<p>No definitely better treatment; but indefinitely&mdash;yes. For
it was well understood that Jacqueline was destined for high
places, and young girls are at least as shrewd as their elders.
There was keen competition to make friends with her, with an eye to
the future. The flattery might have turned her head, if she had not
been reared by a man who understood and scorned ever subterfuge of
that stuff. She undoubtedly lorded it a little.</p>

<p>And she was good to see, in the neat blue convent dress, that
could not hide a line of her young figure, or a graceful movement.
Dancing was a part of the convent regimen, and there were private
lessons by a visiting professional for those whose talent was worth
cultivating. At Don Andres' request, Jacqueline had learned old
Spanish dances, and since she would rather please him than anything
else she could conceive of, she had thrown her heart into it, with
the result that she walked as rhythmically as the poets sing; and
the rest was sweetness, happiness, health and day-dreams.</p>

<p>For in a convent such as that one, what life may turn out to be
after leaving is a dream not quite distinguishable from a pictured
heaven. One could make magnificent conjectures, fairy prince or
prancing horse included, with the saints to draw from and the
stories of the saints to pattern human conduct by.</p>

<p>Jacqueline was not so afraid of Jack Calhoun from within the
convent walls. And she did not think of Donna Isabella, lest
suggestions of a tail and cloven hoofs should cause embarrassment
and lead to irksome penances. The subject of Jack Calhoun leaked
out in a recreation hour and rather thrilled her. There were girls
who had witnessed the scene in church on Easter Sunday, and of all
the rapturously fascinating, irrepressible and newsy themes in a
convent, none can hold a candle to a love-affair.</p>

<p>Handsome Jack Calhoun! Young&mdash;wealthy, or so
reputed&mdash;lord of a great plantation, with estates in Cuba,
too, good family&mdash; horseman&mdash;with a reputation for gaiety
that had reached young ears well filtered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jacqueline, do tell&mdash;what did he say when he gave you the
flowers?"</p>

<p>"Jacqueline, dear&mdash;does he&mdash;does he write to you?"</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it. We're simply crazy to hear!"</p>

<p>But Desmio had taught the art of self-command, and Donna
Isabella's jealousy had bitten the teaching home. Jacqueline was
not to be surprised into embarrassing admissions. And then Sister
Michaela, wanting to know what the talk was all about, approached
the group under the trees without seeming to cloak vigilance.</p>

<p>"What is the joke, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you if you like."</p>

<p>It was Sister Michaela's business to be told things. Except when
she was ringing the convent bell, the chief excuse for her
existence was that gift of hers for winning confidence.</p>

<p>She drew Jacqueline aside, and had the whole story of Jack
Calhoun in two minutes, asking only three deft questions in a voice
that would have coaxed out serpents from the sea, it was so
bell-like and sympathetic.</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to him alone?"</p>

<p>"No, Sister Michaela, I don't know why, but he frightens me. I'm
not afraid of any of the other men I meet."</p>

<p>"Have you talked about him to any one?"</p>

<p>"Only to Consuelo."</p>

<p>"Does Don Andres know anything of this?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;or I don't think so. Donna Isabella and Consuelo said
I mustn't tell him because of his ill-health. I wish I might tell
him. Desmio always knows just what to do about everything."</p>

<p>Sister Michaela diagnosed much deeper than the surface, and her
words went promptly to the very roots of what she saw:</p>

<p>"Don't take it seriously, Jacqueline. Don't believe too much.
Remember this: Other people are not all as tender-hearted, and
credulous as you are. They don't always say what they mean or
always believe what they pretend to believe. As long as you know
your own mind, and are good, you can afford to laugh at any one's
unwelcome attentions."</p>

<p>"Consuelo told me to look daggers at him!" laughed
Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>Sister Michaela smiled, and Jacqueline's frown appeared. She
rather resented the suggestion that she could not look ferocious if
she tried. From under her white bandeau,* Sister Michaela watched
the frown as if it were plain writing by a moving finger in a
language that she understood.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>bandeau</i> (French)&mdash;a narrow band
for the hair.]</p>

<p>"Put not your trust in princes, Jacqueline," she said at last.
"Some of them are frauds, and some are weak. Always trust your own
intuition. That's the Blessed Virgin's voice that warns you."</p>

<p>Good advice, but not quite comforting. There was something
ominous about it, as if Sister Michaela had foreseen dark events.
She went off to toll the bell, leaving Jacqueline feeling rather
depressed; but perhaps that was intended, since advice that leaves
no sting is all the easier forgotten.</p>

<p>"Does she mean Desmio is the prince I should not trust?"
Jacqueline wondered, and the frown vanished, as she threw that
thought away, dismissed it, scorned it too utterly to waste
displeasure on it. But she remembered Sister Michaela's words, and
pondered them all through the French lesson, so that she had to be
reprimanded for inattention; and if it had not been that a dancing
lesson followed that she might have pondered them all day. But
there was nothing ponderous or ominous about dancing, and it
banished every consideration except high spirits and an appetite.
When Sister Michaela tolled the bell for dinner there was nothing
in Jacqueline's mood but laughter and a yearning for beef and
vegetables; the future, insofar as it existed in her thoughts, was
foreshortened to one day ahead, when she would have been back a
week and Desmio would probably drive over in the limousine with his
usual offering of candy for herself and flowers for the chapel
altar.</p>

<p>Desmio! What on earth did she care for princes, as long as he
came once a week! But the next day it was Consuelo, and not Desmio,
who came. Consuelo was ushered into the great quiet drawing-room,
where all guests were received, and was kept waiting there until
she could interview the Sister Superior before Jacqueline was sent
for. The request in itself was surprising, for Consuelo was well
known at the convent and usually Jacqueline was brought straight to
her and allowed to talk with her alone for half an hour. Consuelo
strutted down the corridor fuming, bobbed her curtsey at the
threshold, collapsed into becoming humility, was smiled at and
addressed by name, bobbed her curtsey again and laid a sealed
envelope on the desk.</p>

<p>"A letter for Miss Jacqueline, please."</p>

<p>A sweet wise smile by way of answer&mdash;a little nod of
acknowledgment and a glance at the address on the envelope. Nothing
incorrect, or even unusual. Letters intended for young ladies in
the convent never reach them until after they have been opened and
read, but Consuelo might have handed it to any of the sisters;
nevertheless, it was very right and proper of Consuelo to take such
full precaution. Anything else? Certainly she might see Miss
Jacqueline. Another smile from under a snow-white bandeau; then the
face disappeared as the head bent forward, and a hand such as
Tintoretto painted went on writing, writing with a golden pen.
Consuelo bobbed her way out backward, all the steam gone out of
her.</p>

<p>Then Jacqueline in the drawing-room in the plain blue dress that
Consuelo hated, and with her hair mismanaged scandalously, and
Consuelo unaccountably wet-eyed, which led, of course, to instant
urgent questions about Desmio. But Desmio had sent kind messages,
along with the flowers and a veritable load of chocolates, and was
feeling so much better that he hoped to be able to come neat
week.</p>

<p>"Then why are you crying, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>"Honey, dear, I don't know&mdash;I've done my best for you,
that's all. Oh, honey, and you so innocent! And them so bent
on&mdash;Listen, be still a while and listen!"</p>

<p>Consuelo looked up through the tears at Jacqueline, who was
standing beside her with her arm on the chair-back, wondering. The
young heart was beating almost as violently as the old one. Every
imaginable fear was in the air&mdash;the worse&mdash;the most
unspeakable&mdash;that Consuelo might have fallen foul at last of
Donna Isabella and have been dismissed.</p>

<p>"Conchita, don't admit a thing! Don't let them trick you into a
confession that you've given that Calhoun boy as much as a glimpse
of a smile!"</p>

<p>"But I have smiled, Consuelo."</p>

<p>"Don't admit it! There's a trap laid, child. They're going to
catch you in it, if you're not careful, and marry you off to that
jackanapes&mdash;and they'll make Don Andres agree to it by
pretending to him that you've been giving Calhoun encouragement on
the sly."</p>

<p>"But I haven't, Consuelo. You know that."</p>

<p>"Lord knows I know it, honey."</p>

<p>"Who are 'they,' Consuelo?"</p>

<p>"Him and her&mdash;the jackanapes and Donna Isabella."</p>

<p>"How I do wish Desmio knew!"</p>

<p>"He does, honey. I told him."</p>

<p>Instant electric change in the whole world atmosphere, and
Jacqueline herself again! She laughed aloud&mdash;kissed
Consuelo&mdash;petted her &mdash;had Consuelo smiling in a
minute&mdash;praised her&mdash;danced, to the scandal of the image
of Saint Pierre in the niche above the mantelpiece&mdash;(or
perhaps he was a saint who knew a good thing when he saw it, for
there are such)&mdash;made such a merry noise of steps and laughter
that Sister Helena came in to discover what on earth was happening,
and laughed too.</p>

<p>"Showing her the new dance, Jacqueline? Do you think you ought
to do that in here, dear? Things should be kept in their proper
places."</p>

<p>"Isn't everywhere a proper place to dance when you feel happy?"
Jacqueline answered. She would have danced with Sister Helena and
devil take the consequences, if that had not been a place where
they understand the management of buoyant young humans. Sister
Helena forestalled indignity by meeting Jacqueline midway and, with
an arm on her shoulder, switched attention firmly on Consuelo.</p>

<p>"How nice that she should be so glad to see you. You must come
again."</p>

<p>Which was hint sufficient. Under Donna Isabella's regime one
learned to read hints swiftly, and Consuelo hurried her departure
as if she were almost guilty of sacrilege in having stayed so long.
Jacqueline was led back to the study hall, both arms full of
chocolate, and turned loose to distribute them. She was kept back
that day after the lesson and was made to do six sums on the
blackboard; but not even that subdued her thoroughly, and her eyes
were full of laughter even when she was summoned to the Sister
Superior's office before supper.</p>

<p>But you could feel subdued in the Sister Superior's presence.
You could not feel otherwise. It needed no sense of guilt&mdash;no
evil conscience to make you stand silent before the desk and wait
until the veined patrician hand laid down the golden pen, the
bandeau was slowly raised, and the face framed in white looked at
you searchingly.</p>

<p>"How many letters, since you have been in the convent, have you
received from Mr. Calverly-Calhoun, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"None, Sister Theresa."</p>

<p>The answer was prompt, and qualified by nothing except surprise.
Jacqueline's frown appeared, aggravatingly mischievous, but the
Sister Superior was not to be easily deceived by surface
indications.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Sister."</p>

<p>"A letter has come addressed to you from Mr. Calverly-Calhoun,
and I have been told that he saw you to the convent gate on your
return from the Easter Congé. Does Don Andres know of his
attentions to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sister."</p>

<p>That answer was triumphant&mdash;not a doubt of it.</p>

<p>"Does he approve?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I haven't spoken to him."</p>

<p>The frown again, followed by the first shade of doubt in the
Sister Superior's eyes.</p>

<p>"You were always such a good girl, Jacqueline. We have been so
proud of you."</p>

<p>Silence&mdash;the frown dancing on her forehead, making pretense
of all the comical emotions which Jacqueline did not feel.</p>

<p>"In his letter, Mr. Calhoun mentions previous notes that he has
written to you."</p>

<p>Jacqueline shook her head.</p>

<p>"Have you received none? You are sure?"</p>

<p>Again the head-shake.</p>

<p>"None at home during the Congé?"</p>

<p>"None at any time, Sister."</p>

<p>Long silence. Eyes, hidden by the white bandeau, studying
something which a book on the desk concealed from Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Then why should Mr. Calverly-Calhoun distinctly assert that he
has written to you repeatedly, and upbraid you for not
answering?"</p>

<p>Rebellion&mdash;high chin and flashing eyes&mdash;Jacqueline at
her very loveliest, indignant.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Sister Theresa. I know nothing of his letters, I
don't know why he should write or pretend to have written."</p>

<p>Triumph again&mdash;a short, angry little nod. Desmio knew, and
that settled it.</p>

<p>"How do you account for it that Mr. Calverly-Calhoun should
write you a letter couched in most ardent terms, and make pointed
reference to previous letters, if you have given him no
encouragement, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"May I see the letter, Sister?"</p>

<p>"No. I will send it to Don Andres."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! Oh, please don't. Desmio is ill and a shock
might&mdash; "</p>

<p>The last word froze on frightened lips. She could not force
herself to speak of the horror of Desmio's possible death on her
account. But fear is all too easily misinterpreted, and those
little furrows over her eyes suggested panic without explaining
it.</p>

<p>"You should have thought of that before you let yourself be led
into this. Now go to your own room, Jacqueline, and search your
heart and consider whether you have told me the whole truth."</p>

<p>Fiat lex!* There was no appeal from the Sister Superior's
decision, nor any argument permitted once the order had gone forth.
Jacqueline went to her room. The Sister Superior sat reconsidering
a letter in a man's handwriting &mdash;almost able to discern the
handsome, impetuous, bold graceless features of the man who wrote,
in the sentences that all began carefully and all ended in a hurry,
in disorder, with a dash in place of full stop.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Fiat lex!</i> (Latin)&mdash;Let the law

]</p>

<p class="letter">Dearest, most delightful Jacqueline!<br>
<br>
You know you are mine&mdash;you know it! Why be cruel to me? Why
first encourage me with those smiles that set my heart on fire, and
then treat me coldly?&mdash;Again and again I have written to
you&mdash;am I never to receive an answer?<br>
<br>
Are you afraid of me? Then why? Would I not rather die than do you
injury or see you harmed? Jacqueline! Love such as mine can not be
refused! It is all- conquering! You are mine&mdash;you are
mine&mdash;for I love you!<br>
<br>
Loveliest torturer! Be generous! Unwelcome business drags me away
to Cuba, where I must attend to my estates&mdash;estates that you
shall some day turn into heaven for me. Must I eat my heart out all
these miles away, wondering what your silence means? Jacqueline, I
must go in two days. Write to me! Or at the least send me word by
Consuelo that I may hope&mdash;that you are not cold toward
me&mdash;that, if only a little, you reciprocate my love!<br>
<br>
Forever and forever yours with all my heart,<br>
<br>
Jack Calverly-Calhoun.</p>

<p>The Sister Superior returned the letter to its envelope and
placed that into a larger one along with a two-page letter in her
own fine Italian hand addressed to Don Andres. Five minutes later
the sister on duty carried it out and locked it into the mail bag
with the rest&mdash;a hundred or more letters (all censored) to a
hundred homes, and a score or so of business communications, all
looking just as harmless on the outside.</p>

<p>And in her room up two flights of polished stairs Jacqueline lay
on her bed torn between triumph, indignation and anxiety. Search
her heart? She had nothing to search it for! She did not know
whether the letter from Jack Calhoun had come through the post or
whether Consuelo had brought it, but she suspected Consuelo
naturally&mdash;else why the tears? Was that what Consuelo meant by
saying she had done her best? It was rather bewildering. She felt
confused, and inclined to cry, the whole thing was so underhanded
and contemptible.</p>

<p>But emotions came in waves, and presently were mixed in a
maelstrom of perplexity. Why had the Sister Superior doubted her?
What did she mean by suspecting her of not having told the whole
truth? Excepting only Donna Isabella, nobody before in all her life
had dared so much as to hint she was a liar. The thought made her
furious. It made her even more furious that a shock of any kind
should come to Desmio through her.</p>

<p>She did not doubt Desmio loved her more than anything else in
the world, since he had said so more than once, and he never said
what was not absolutely true. It was
cruel&mdash;unjust&mdash;wicked! How dared Jack Calhoun insert
himself into her life?</p>

<p>What did that Jack Calhoun mean by daring to say she had
received other letters from him? What did he intend by it? He must
have known the letter would be intercepted. Not even Consuelo would
have dared to bring her a letter without the Mother Superior's
knowledge. Was it a trick then? Was that what Consuelo meant by
saying a trap was laid for her?</p>

<p>Then came the thought of running away. If the Sister Superior
thought her a liar, she would not stay under the roof another
minute! She would escape &mdash;run all the way on foot back home
to Desmio. She would make sheets into a rope, the way they did in
story-books, and let herself down from the window and
run&mdash;perhaps not go straight to Desmio, but hide somewhere and
send for him. But she knew all the while she could never escape
from the convent, however hard she might try. The impossibility of
escaping made her feel angrier than ever.</p>

<p>Sleep. Even an ocean wearies in the end. Calm follows a typhoon.
Deep dreamless sleep from which&mdash;all powers be
praised!&mdash;no misery can keep any of us too long.</p>

<p>So&mdash;bringing supper on a tray&mdash;Sister Michaela found
her with one arm under head, her hair disheveled, and her body
looking as if waves had tossed it on the beach of time. Even with
the electric light turned on, she did not wake for several minutes,
and Sister Michaela stood watching her, telling beads by habit
rather than intention. She had reached the thirteenth bead before
Jacqueline awoke.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling better, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>She sat up, recognized a friend and answered&mdash;as Sister
Michaela noted&mdash;without the least trace of a desire to hide
her thoughts.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm all different, I feel as if something had
happened. It's&mdash;"</p>

<p>A long pause, only broken by the regularly measured
click-click-click of beads, like the sound of water dripping.</p>

<p>"Sister Michaela&mdash;what did you mean by telling me not to
put my trust in princes?"</p>

<p>"You'll find out. Only remember, dear. And don't forget the rest
of it &mdash;always to trust your intuition. That is the Voice
within. Now eat your supper, and I'll come for the tray by and
by."</p>

<p>Sister Michaela went straight to the Sister Superior and talked
to her without emphasis, but with assurance.</p>

<p>"She is perfectly innocent. But she's romantic, and she has a
capacity for building mountains out of molehills. Her geese are all
swans. She will magnify evil in the same way unless taught not
to."</p>

<p>"Even the best ones sometimes have to learn that in a hard
school," said the Sister Superior, nodding comprehension.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">CHAPTER 6.</a><br>
"Poison&mdash;brewed in mine own house!"</h2>

<p class="first">Don Andres Miro, inheritor of self-command as well
as too much pride, never cared to show his hand until he judged the
proper moment had arrived. The drawers of his desk, and the safe in
the closet, were always locked. He kept his own keys and
counsel.</p>

<p>So Donna Isabella did not even know that a letter came from the
Mother Superior, although she carried in the mail-bag and sat down
facing her brother. She had had no further word with Consuelo about
Jack Calhoun's love letter, being minded to let the nurse bear the
full weight of responsibility in case of accident. The Sister
Superior would certainly write to Don Andres. Donna Isabella was
determined to be on hand and informed of that move of events in
order to snatch the advantage and tell her own version of
Jacqueline's intrigue with Jack Calhoun at the moment when it would
have most weight.</p>

<p>"I am expecting one or two important letters, Andres. Won't you
please open the bag?"</p>

<p>His eyes met hers incuriously. His voice was exactly as
usual.</p>

<p>"Important letters? Certainly, Isabella. I will send them to you
as usual in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"They are letters I don't wish the servants to see. Open the bag
and give them to me, Andres."</p>

<p>But he did not yield an inch of ground, or fail of a moment's
courtesy.</p>

<p>"In that case I will bring them to you with my own hand,
Isabella."</p>

<p>She mastered her exasperation and contrived to smile. "Why
trouble, Andres? With your heart so weak you should spare yourself.
Give me the letters now."</p>

<p>"When my health is too far gone to permit me to cross the patio
it will be time for me to change all my old habits," he answered
suavely. "For the present I am aware that habits cling to me."</p>

<p>"God aids him who changes!" she retorted, quoting the old
Spanish proverb. Then she rose and left the room with all the air
of indifference she could master&mdash;which was rather less than
she could wish. Don Andres' eyes smiled as the door shut with a
snap behind her, and he inserted the key in the mail-bag lock.</p>

<p>The Sister Superior's letter emerged first. He sat turning it
over and over without opening it. He scented
danger&mdash;nodded&mdash;put the letter in his pocket and began to
sort over the rest of the contents of the bag. Two minutes later he
crossed the patio and opened the drawing-room door.</p>

<p>"No letters for you, Isabella."</p>

<p>She felt obliged to look surprised, and he looked sorry to have
brought her disappointing news, but that was all. She decided she
had hoped too soon. The next day's mail, or the next, would bring
it.</p>

<p>But Don Andres returned to the library and sat for a whole hour
reading and rereading&mdash;first the Sister Superior's fine
script&mdash;and then the bold impulsive hand of Jack Calhoun, that
began its sentences so downrightly and ended them in a scrawl and a
dash toward the next.</p>

<p>It hurt. For a while his face grew ashen-gray as the weakening
heart- valves failed under the mental pressure. He leaned his head
back on the chair.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, and then with a wave of energy, Don Andres
seemed almost to renew his youth. His face grew hard&mdash;the mask
was off. He returned the letters to his pocket. No need to read
them again, for he had them by heart and could see them, paragraph
by paragraph, as if projected on a screen before his eyes.</p>

<p>"&mdash;a good girl, and always truthful. What I do not
understand is the young man's reference to previous letters, which
he complains of her not answering. She denies all knowledge of
them."</p>

<p>"No 'and' about it! Jacqueline denies. That ends the
argument."</p>

<p>He knew who the enemy was, although characteristically even then
he named no names&mdash;not even to himself unheard and unseen in a
room regarded as his sanctuary. He rose, surprised at his own
weakness and, summoning physical strength by an effort of will,
walked over to the door and locked it. Then he sat down again to
review the situation in all its bearings.</p>

<p>"Poison," he muttered to himself. "A pen dipped in poison brewed
in mine own house!"</p>

<p>He recalled Consuelo's impassioned outburst, word by word, and
the orders he had given her.</p>

<p>"Good, faithful woman!" he said, nodding. "She shall be trusted
further."</p>

<p>He smiled as he recalled his sister's anxiety about the
mail-bag&mdash; naming no names&mdash;merely smiling. He understood
that some one was in league with young Calhoun. Sufficient that he
understood it.</p>

<p>Jack Calhoun. Forbid him the house? Perhaps, after all, not
necessary. Cuba. Very fortunate for all concerned, including Jack
Calhoun, whose absence would preserve him from indignity. There
were rumors of financial trouble in connection with that Cuban
plantation; and he rather thought, Don Andres did, that before Mr.
Jack Calhoun could return from Cuba circumstances would have
changed surprisingly&mdash;whereafter he at least hoped Jack
Calhoun would know enough to keep his hands off.</p>

<p>"There is no other way&mdash;at any rate no better way," he
muttered.</p>

<p>It annoyed him that he had been so long in making up his mind,
but he knew that it was only his anxiety on Jacqueline's account
that had made him over-cautious. Now he threw, not caution, but
procrastination to the winds. He went first of all to the desk and
answered the Sister Superior's letter, lest Jacqueline should
suffer an unnecessary moment's anguish.</p>

<p>"&mdash;grateful to you for your vigilance, and, if that were
possible, more sure than ever of your judgment since you confirm my
own conviction that she is always truthful.</p>

<p>"For the rest, I will immediately take steps to prevent a
recurrence of such unsolicited attentions to Jacqueline and their
consequent annoyance to yourself. I will write to you again, in
confidence, about this at the proper time.</p>

<p>"May I suggest to you, meanwhile, if that may be done without
presumption, that nothing would be lost by permitting Jacqueline to
forget the incident, since I can well believe she has already
suffered as much as if she were really guilty of grave
indiscretion. I feel quite sure of her innocence.</p>

<p>"With renewed expression of my confidence&mdash;"</p>

<p>When he had sealed that letter he wrote a telegram&mdash;short,
definite and urgent&mdash;then rang the bell and unlocked the
door.</p>

<p>"Send Consuelo!"</p>

<p>No suggestion of conspiracy&mdash;no hint to Consuelo of a
secret held between them&mdash;not a question concerning how or
when that letter from Jack Calhoun had reached the convent.</p>

<p>"Take the limousine, Consuelo, and deliver this letter into the
Sister Superior's hand. On your way send this telegram."</p>

<p>She understood. Her eyes shone. Don Andres already knew
then&mdash;knew her part in it&mdash;and she was being trusted!</p>

<p>But she had to cross the patio to reach the servants' quarters
and give orders for the limousine; and as the Holy Virgin was her
witness, she was not invisible! She could not make herself unseen
by Donna Isabella, although she would have sunk into the ground for
choice.</p>

<p>"Where are you going in such a hurry, Consuelo? What did Don
Andres want with you?"</p>

<p>Well&mdash;Mother of God have pity on her!&mdash;she had lied a
hundred times to save Miss Jacqueline, and had always done the
penances imposed by Father Doutreleau, exacting though he was! She
could lie again&mdash;and pay for it again&mdash;</p>

<p>"To the drug-store, Donna Isabella."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"For medicine."</p>

<p>"Where is the prescriptions"</p>

<p>It is loyalty that is the mother of invention.</p>

<p>"Doctor Beal promised he would leave it at the drugstore."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell Don Andres that I have given you other
tasks? Go about your own business, I will send one of the
footmen."</p>

<p>But a library window overlooked the patio, and Don Andres
appeared in the doorway to the rescue, saying nothing, merely
observant, shutting the door with a slam behind him to call
attention to himself.</p>

<p>"Andres, why do you send Consuelo on an errand! She's forever
finding some excuse for laziness. I'll send one of the footmen for
your medicine."</p>

<p>"The footmen have bad memories," he answered.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Write it down for him."</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;given&mdash;Consuelo&mdash;my instructions&mdash;
Isabella!"</p>

<p>Brother and sister faced each other, and Consuelo fled; it was
none of her business to witness a family quarrel. Don Andres smiled
faintly as he watched her go, assured that he was right, she could
be trusted.</p>

<p>"Your illness is no excuse, Andres, for putting me to gross
indignity before a servant!"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "no illness could excuse that, could it!"</p>

<p>From her window, fifteen minutes later, she could see the
limousine away in the distance, driving in the opposite direction
to the village where the drug-store was that Andres usually
patronized. It was headed straight for the convent.</p>

<p>So! That settled that! The news was out, and Consuelo must have
turned the trick against her! What an idiot she had been to trust
that woman&mdash;to endure her in the house!</p>

<p>It was too much already to have had to endure Jacqueline.
Perhaps Andres thought that by insisting on keeping Jacqueline he
could irritate her into leaving his roof and taking up quarters
elsewhere. If so, he fooled himself! She had her rights&mdash;the
legal right, not only to an income out of the estate, but to reside
in the Miro mansion. No more than any Miro would she ever
relinquish one privilege!</p>

<p>Well&mdash;so it was war, was it, between Andres and herself?
She might as well look the fact in the face.</p>

<p>The bone of contention was Jacqueline. The only ally whom she
could think of for the moment was Jack Calhoun. What had the young
fool gone to Cuba for? Why couldn't he have waited?</p>

<p>Andres knew now about Calhoun's attentions to Jacqueline; that
much was obvious. Give him enough scandal, and he would force
Jacqueline into a marriage with Jack Calhoun or any other man!</p>

<p>Why in the name of ninety saints had the young fool gone away to
Cuba?</p>

<p>Well&mdash;he could come back, couldn't he? He looked impetuous
enough for anything!</p>

<p>Donna Isabella sat down at her escritoire and wrote to Jack
Calhoun one of those guarded communications that stir the
recipient's imagination by suggestion of what they leave
unsaid.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Don Andres Miro has heard of your attentions to Miss
Lanier and is taking steps to prevent a recurrence.</p>

<p>"I am quite ignorant of his plans. He has not consulted me. I
have no actual proof that he has in mind some other individual of
his own choosing, who perhaps he thinks will make a better husband
for Miss Lanier&mdash;"</p>

<p>Donna Isabella smiled over that sentence. If anything could
bring Jack Calhoun hurrying back from Cuba, that would. She sealed
up the letter and took exquisite delight in dropping it into the
mail-bag in her brother's presence and watching him turn the key,
insuring trouble for himself. It made her sunny-tempered for an
hour.</p>

<p>However, at the end of the hour she was on the horns of anxiety
again; for it was she in person who received over the telephone a
telegram from New Orleans. Curtis Radcliffe would arrive in time
for dinner.</p>

<p>What was Andres up to now? Curtis Radcliffe had the reputation
of being the cleverest lawyer in Louisiana, and that was synonymous
in Donna Isabella's mind with treachery and underhanded
cunning.</p>

<p>Andres might be thinking of changing his will, but he would
hardly send for such an expensive man as Radcliffe in a hurry about
that, because the estates and investments were practically all
included in the Miro trust deed, and there was not a great deal
else that Andres had to bequeath. Was he proposing to try to change
the trust deed? Then she need not worry! He had tried that once
before. Radcliffe had advised him it would need his sister's
signature as well as that of the cousin who manufactured gum shoes.
Andres would be too proud even to approach the gum shoe-maker, and
as for herself, wild horses should not make her sign anything!</p>

<p>Summoning all her self-control she went to the library and
announced the telegram.</p>

<p>"Curtis Radcliffe is on his way."</p>

<p>"I supposed so. I have just written notes to Doutreleau and
Beal, inviting them to dinner too, to meet him."</p>

<p>"Really, Andres! Do you call that fair to me? How can I arrange
a dinner for three guests at a moment's notice? Couldn't you have
spoken sooner?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I do not like to speak before I have decided,
Isabella."</p>

<p>How could anybody be affectionate to such a man! It was all she
could do to avoid precipitating an open quarrel&mdash;more than she
could do to retire without firing a Parthian shot.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Parthian shot</i>&mdash;a tactic employed
by ancient Persian horse archers. The horsemen would feign retreat
at full gallop, then suddenly turn their bodies around and fire
arrows at the pursuing enemy. <i><a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_shot">Wikipedia</a></i>.
Used metaphorically in this context.]</p>

<p>"I'm evidently nothing more than your housekeeper!"</p>

<p>"Not evidently, Isabella!"</p>

<p>Now what in the name of all the martyrs did he mean by that?
Something sly undoubtedly. She slammed the door, and made up her
mind that the dinner- party should not go down in the Miro annals
as a joy to be recalled and lingered over.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, not even her sardonic humor spoiled the feast, for
Andres was at his best and gave his own instructions to the butler
about wine. And Curtis Radcliffe was a man whose conversation
flourished on Chateau Margeaux '84&mdash;who knew good jokes about
the priesthood that made François Doutreleau chuckle and hold his
sides&mdash;who was far too discerning to annoy Beal with equally
good digs at the doctors&mdash;and whose stories about lawyers were
as merciless as they were funny.</p>

<p>"You appear to glory in the baseness of your own profession!"
snorted Donna Isabella.</p>

<p>"As the good sun glories in the darkness it dispels!" said
Doutreleau.</p>

<p>"As courtesy delights in opportunity&mdash;or a surgeon
likes&mdash;what is it that a surgeon aspires to, Beal?" asked
Andres.</p>

<p>"Partnership, with Radcliffe and myself!" said Doutreleau. Beal
never had an answer ready.</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned house, with the old time-honored ways
unchanged. The men sat over the nuts and wine when the hostess had
withdrawn, and Donna Isabella wandered about the patio moodily,
listening to laughter that annoyed her all the more because she
knew it masked seriousness. They would not talk business in the
dining room, she knew that; Andres was a man who did everything at
the appointed time and in the proper place. Whatever secret scheme
had brought these four together would be discussed in the library
and probably behind a locked door.</p>

<p>But the night was warm, and three of the library windows faced
the lawn. Donna Isabella had a perfect right to enjoy the flowers
and the moonlight shimmering on undulating landscape&mdash;perfect
right to summon a footman and have a chair set for herself beneath
an open window. She had a perfect right to sit still and nearly
choke herself with a handkerchief trying to suppress a cough (for
the night was a trifle chilly after all) when she heard the four
men enter the library and felt, rather than saw the lights turned
on.</p>

<p>She could hear Radcliffe making the circuit of the bookshelves.
Doutreleau, she knew was already in an armchair. She heard Beal
clear his throat, and heard his chair creak as he turned it toward
Andres. Then her brother's calm voice; she could imagine him, with
his back to the fireplace, smiling;</p>

<p>"Now, Beal, out with it! How long am I likely to live?"</p>

<p>Ten thousand devils take the man! Beal never answered
promptly&mdash; hummed and ha-a-ed like a nincompoop, as if afraid
of his own voice. And Donna Isabella&mdash;whether she was startled
or felt chilled because she had not brought her
shawl&mdash;coughed, and smothered a second cough into a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>A moment later she heard Andres stride to the window. He closed
it and pulled the shade down without deigning to glance out to see
who might be sitting underneath it. He could guess too
easily&mdash;preferred too magnificently not to know.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">CHAPTER 7.</a><br>
"Some one's going to suffer,<br>
Sherry Mansfield, but I'll make it!"</h2>

<p class="first">Affairs in Cuba might be&mdash;usually
are&mdash;and were, in point of fact, precarious. Not even a
Calverly-Calhoun may mortgage an estate however rich, pay ten
percent interest, endure one hurricane, one drought, and one year's
blight, entrust the management of the estate to an alien&mdash;and
not face consequences. However, one can sometimes postpone
settlement, especially if one happens to be twenty-seven, with a
letter in one's pocket that has stirred the very lees of urgency
and therewith, too, the poison of inborn recklessness.</p>

<p>So bankers in Havana locked new notes away, and Jack Calhoun
paced the deck of a New Orleans-bound steamer, wishing whip and
spurs might take the place of coal. It was a slow boat&mdash;just
his luck!&mdash;crawling along with the hose on a hot main-bearing
and a screen of seaweed like a petticoat. But the smoking-room was
good enough&mdash;capable steward and plenty to drink&mdash;with a
scattering of passengers less impatient than himself, whose
conversation served at intervals to help pass time.</p>

<p>Clinton Wahl, for instance, special correspondent of the New
Orleans Star, on his way back from covering political events in
Cuba; quite a personage in a way, and not unconscious of it, but
not so bad to talk to, if only he would not think in head-lines and
pretend to see ambitious motive at the back of every event. A cad,
of course, but amusing.</p>

<p>And young Sherwood Mansfield, not a cad by any means, but son of
the owner of the San Francisco Tribune, and likely to inherit
millions&mdash; meanwhile, worshipful of Clinton Wahl because a
star reporter looks like Betelgeuse to a newspaper man whose career
is yet to make.</p>

<p>It was rather good fun to watch the by-play between those
two&mdash;Wahl obviously cultivating the friendship of the younger
man for opportunist reasons, and Sherry Mansfield thrilled by
intimacy with some one who signed his own special articles, and
whose photograph appeared at the head of every syndicated column
that he wrote. Between spells of furious deck-pacing Jack Calhoun
struck up acquaintance with the pair.</p>

<p>There were those, especially later on, and Clinton Wahl among
them, who assessed young Jack Calhoun as a mere profligate who
never took thought and who always acted on the impulse of the
moment. But that is the point of view induced by ribbon headlines.
There were wheels within wheels&mdash;phases
&mdash;moods&mdash;alternating passions&mdash;shrewdness beside
impulse &mdash;swift discernment in addition to overbearing
recklessness&mdash;and an element of kindness and good humor in his
composition. He would not have been a Calverly-Calhoun if he had
not had wit, and an instinct for making himself agreeable.</p>

<p>When Clinton Wahl grew weary of Sherry Mansfield's hero-worship
and took a turn on deck, Jack Calhoun, vastly and intuitively
preferring the younger man, entered the smoking-room and took a
seat beside him. Mansfield was a companionable young chap, sturdy,
frank and full of enthusiasm, with earnest gray eyes that could
light up when he laughed; and his laugh was contagious.</p>

<p>He had puzzled Jack Calhoun, who had the notorious Calhoun gift
for appraising people swiftly, and who only did not profit by it
(as all his forebears had done) because he was too lazy. They sat
at the same dining table, and he had found Sherry Mansfield even
more interesting than the three girls opposite, who obviously
preferred young Mansfield to himself&mdash;an unusual enough
experience in Jack Calhoun's life to intrigue him thoroughly. There
was a peculiar, half-wistful, wholly determined look about Sherry
Mansfield's mouth that increased his attractiveness. When he was
not smiling he looked as if his own courage and his own good timber
had enabled him to survive it, without obliterating the memory.</p>

<p>Young Sherwood Mansfield liked to talk to men&mdash;with any
man; but froze in the presence of women, not apparently nervous,
but stone-cold suddenly, and colder yet as they made advances to
him. Habitual lady-killer, Jack Calhoun drew exquisite amusement
from the drama, thrice daily at meals, as those three young women
opposite them at table tried to make themselves agreeable to Sherry
Mansfield, and invariably were out their pains. He himself for
excellent reasons was on his best behavior that voyage, indulging
in no flirtations, minded for this once to lay a pure, if overbold
heart at the feet of his adored; but he was deadly curious to know
why this handsome young chap, with money, and so much life in him,
should set him such a marvelous example.</p>

<p>Sherwood Mansfield did not look, nor talk, like a man in love.
There is intuitive freemasonry between men whose hearts are aflame
with that divine passion, and Mansfield was the one on the boat
with whom Jack Calhoun would have deigned to discuss his own
idolatry, as one equal to another. But the few hints he had let
drop fell on barren ground; Sherry Mansfield simply avoided the
usually, all-absorbing subject of women and their lure, frowning
slightly on occasion, but more often seeming to fall vaguely on
guard&mdash; then smiling the moment the subject was changed.</p>

<p>There was not another subject in the world that he was not
apparently willing to talk about, and with intelligence. Because of
his keenness to tread in his father's footsteps, world news was at
his finger-tips, and he took the same sort of delight in it that
some fellows take in baseball scores. Sooner or later, whatever the
subject, he worked it round to the newspaper angle, and it was then
that almost all his wistfulness vanished, his smile was most
contagious, and his eyes shone brightest.</p>

<p>"Don't you think Clinton Wahl's a wonder?" he asked Calhoun.</p>

<p>"Wonders never cease," Jack answered, "but they vary, suh. I
should say he has brains of a sort, but they're no good without
breeding. He'd have been a professional gambler or a fake-stock
salesman if he hadn't struck his gait at journalism."</p>

<p>"Wahl's no journalist!" Sherry snorted. "He's a newspaper
man."</p>

<p>"Profound apology! But what's the difference, may I ask?"</p>

<p>Sherry ignored the question. One does not talk of one's religion
to outsiders.</p>

<p>"As for gambling&mdash;Wahl did more than any one to expose the
Cuban lotteries and the New Orleans policy ring. Didn't you read of
it?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I did. How's your dad these days? I suppose he owns
San Francisco?"</p>

<p>"Well, hardly! But he's made the Tribune the biggest thing in
the West. It's all the life he cares for, and he lives
it&mdash;doesn't even play golf."</p>

<p>Wahl came sauntering in again and sat down with his arms on the
table facing the other two. Calhoun knew that look in the cavernous
eyes and race- track mouth. Young men of wealth soon learn to
recognize it, or they cease from being rich. Studying the thin nose
and the movement of the long lean neck, Calhoun knew exactly how
far he would trust him.</p>

<p>"There's a woman in a deck-chair near the bulletin board," Wahl
said, smiling at Sherry. "I saw her in Santiago once or twice, but
hadn't time to get to know her. If you asked me&mdash;there's a yen
in her eye, and she's lonely. If I were as young and good-looking
as you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, to hell with her!" said Sherry Mansfield, and Jack Calhoun
noticed the return of the peculiar wistful look that was so
intriguing.</p>

<p>"To hell with her certainly, by all means," he agreed politely.
Then, hazarding a shrewd guess: "but what's wrong with the
sex?"</p>

<p>Sherry Mansfield frowned and rose from his seat.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take the air a while," he announced; and at the
thought of fresh air the momentary ill-humor left him. He was
whistling by the time he reached the door.</p>

<p>"Likable youngster," said Wahl, "and the women seem crazy about
him, but he'll go far, for he mistrusts 'em!"</p>

<p>Jack ordered drinks. "Old story, I suppose," he answered. "I
remember at his age I mistrusted the whole sex for a week, or maybe
nine days. It was after the wife of a man in Key West turned
virtuous and went back to her husband."</p>

<p>"Ungrateful female!" Wahl commented; and Jack Calhoun bridled a
bit; he instinctively resented having Wahl in agreement with him on
any point. However, it does not much matter with whom you talk on
board ship; and just at that moment the steward brought the
drinks.</p>

<p>"I never knew a grateful woman," Wahl went on, "unless it's true
that gratitude is a foretaste of ambition. In that case, yes. If
not, no. It's the scheming sex."</p>

<p>"It's the delightful sex," said Jack Calhoun. "I drink to
them."</p>

<p>"It's the criminal sex," Wahl continued, warming up to what
might be his favorite subject. "If you'd been on newspapers as long
as I have you'd agree that nine-tenths of the crime in the world,
and nearly all the trouble is due to women. They've a natural flair
for posing as virtuous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Lord made 'em female and marvelous lovely!" Jack
interrupted.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and there's a fixed tradition that they're incapable of
evil motive or the brutal passions. But watch 'em at a prize
fight!" Wahl went on. "Watch 'em at a gambling resort! Above all,
I've learned to watch 'em when I'm on a story! Cherchez la femme*
is good scripture. If it's theft, arson, crooked politics, or
murder, you may safely bet your last coin there's a woman at the
bottom of it, deliberately responsible and secretly pleased
&mdash;usually a young woman, with a face like a Madonna's and a
mouth that butter wouldn't melt in."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Cherchez la femme</i> (French)&mdash;Look
for the woman (when seeking the source of a problem). First used in
this sense by Alexandre Dumas the Elder in his drama "Les Mohicains
de Paris (1864). <i><a href=
"http://www.blueprints.de/content/view/449/33">Blueprints.de</a></i>.
]</p>

<p>"I call that disgustin' cynicism," Jack remarked. "I should say
you get devilish small fun out of life."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," Wahl answered. "I've had my share of fun.
They don't spare us; why should we spare them? The thing to do is
to keep awake and not let a woman put one over on you. I
remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Jack Calhoun lit a cigar and got up yawning. It did not
amuse him to hear of the amours of a person like Wahl, and he went
out to pace the deck with Sherry.</p>

<p>For a while as they strode side by side around the deck they
talked at random, and Sherry spoke so eagerly of New Orleans and
the probable hour of arrival that Jack Calhoun suspected more than
ever that there was a love-affair not running smoothly. He worked
the conversation round to women by remarking that the Creoles of
New Orleans are earth's loveliest daughters; and when the wistful
expression returned instantly to Sherry's face Jack felt sure he
had uncovered the secret.</p>

<p>"When the fair sex is adamant, or damned elusive," he remarked
with a far- away reminiscent air, "the key to love's young dream
consists in gettin' your heart's darlin' into difficulties, and
then helpin' her out. They've a genius for sufferin' over trifles.
The ones most worth lovin' furiously are the easiest to scare. I'm
head over heels in love myself with a perfect little angel in a
convent&mdash;and they're like jails, y'know, those places. It's
easier to get money out of a banker than to get your adored out of
a convent. I'm hopin' mine'll get fired out. I've cooked up a
scheme, to make the pope or somebody believe she's been gettin'
letters from me on the sly. That ought to work it. Once you've
saved your adored from a predicament you're Romeo in her
eyes&mdash;and a worshipful fair woman, suh, is a brighter jewel in
a gentleman's eye than art, or religion, or even patriotism! You'll
excuse me if I speak with feeling. I'm in love myself."</p>

<p>But Sherry Mansfield astonished by not excusing him. He was
hardly polite. He looked offended, as if Jack Calhoun had touched
on some secret that he had no right to probe&mdash;something that
hurt him almost physically. The pained look brought the cruelty in
Jack Calhoun to the surface; sympathy vanished; and as Sherry
Mansfield turned back into the smoking-room Jack resumed his walk
alone with a smile of satisfied amusement.</p>

<p>"A soft streak in him somewhere," he reflected. Only lovely
women, in his theory of life, were entitled to that form of
weakness.</p>

<p>But Sherwood Mansfield's discontent had its roots in the past,
not the present; he was thinking in terms of the future, and
smiling, when he entered the smoking-room and sat down beside Wahl.
Possible desire to cover up whatever it might be that tortured him,
made him seize with all the greater energy on any subject that held
optimism. And Wahl was a man who had done things, not a spendthrift
like Calhoun. He glanced at Wahl with diffidence, and began to
speak to him, as, not so long ago, he would have confided in the
captain of the college team&mdash;manly, and sure enough of what he
had to say, but deferent.</p>

<p>"You've spoken once or twice of news and head-lines. I think
your flair for news is marvelous. I wonder if you'd think it cheek
on my part to suggest that you're simply wasted on the New Orleans
Star? None of my business, of course, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't apologize. I'm interested."</p>

<p>That was no exaggeration. Wahl's eyes glittered. "My dad's
always hunting for brains. He hopes I'll step into his shoes some
day, and, of course, so do I, but that's a long way off. It
occurred to me that if I should wire him something to the effect
that you'd consider an offer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's a wireless operator on this boat," said Wahl.</p>

<p>"&mdash;he'd appreciate my having kept the Tribune's interests
in mind; and, of course, he's keen to see how I shape up. It
wouldn't hurt me with him if he knew I'd picked a winner so early
in the game&mdash;if you don't mind my picking you; that is. And of
course, I can't promise anything. Dad owns the Tribune, and he
manages it; there isn't any one on earth who can dictate to
him."</p>

<p>"That's what makes the Tribune good," said Wahl. "It won't hurt
to send your dad a wire. You're not going back to Frisco then?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. Dad wired me to stay over in New Orleans and cover the
flood stuff if it happens. He's always trying to put a big chance
my way."</p>

<p>His eyes were alight with enthusiasm as he spoke of that; but
Wahl smiled with cynical amusement.</p>

<p>"You won't call flood stuff a big chance when you're my age. You
can sit at your desk and write up all the floods from Noah's to
next year's. Nothing to it&mdash;unless you can tie the blame to
some one, or get the goods on Shem with Ham's wife. The crowd'll
read flood headlines if they're peppy, and then turn to the divorce
news and the story of a soubrette blinding another woman's lover
with carbolic acid. However, I suppose your dad figures you're
passing through and you'd better cover it on the off-chance. Take
my tip and don't get too enthusiastic. Stories of broken levees and
drowned cattle &mdash;lists of dead and missing&mdash;estimates of
damage&mdash;cost as much over the wires as a magnate's passion for
a chorus girl, and believe me, there's nothing to it when it comes
to which sells papers. Feed the public what it wants, and it'll
feed you. That's religion. Suppose we draft a wire to Mansfield
senior. I'd rather be on the Tribune than on all the other papers
put together."</p>

<p>Mansfield produced a pencil and began to write the telegram, but
it was Clinton Wahl who shaped it, deftly suggesting phases,
head-line fashion, and although Sherry was hardly aware of it, the
telegram was almost wholly Wahl's when it was finished and the
final draft approved. Wahl took it to the operator, smiling to
himself. This was opportunity, and it knocks at a man's door only
once!</p>

<p>But Wahl knew too much to depend altogether on young Sherry
Mansfield's influence with his father; men of the type who can
build a San Francisco Tribune out of nothing are not given to flash
decisions based on a youngster's capacity for hero-worship.
Opportunity may knock, but it calls for ability to open the door
wide enough.</p>

<p>"That's on the way," he said, returning to sit beside Sherry.
"Now, if only a story would break! If I could wire the Tribune
something juicy and exclusive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not cover the Mississippi floods with me?" asked Sherry
generously. "Something might happen. Your flair for
news&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Boy&mdash;I've written up the Mississippi once a year regularly
since I cut my eye-teeth! Tell you what&mdash;I'll sit here and
write your story for you, head-lines and all! Put it in your
pocket, and use it as your own if the levees break. If they don't,
keep it for next year. It'll come in handy sometime."</p>

<p>But therein Wahl showed misjudgment. Sherry's was the ambition
that would rather win its own spurs. His bright face clouded over
and he changed the subject, not exactly deftly:</p>

<p>"Where's the best place in New Orleans to hire a car by the
day?" he asked. "I'm not going to waste time in the city."</p>

<p>"H'm! Story up his sleeve," thought Wahl. "I'll do the levees
with him after all."</p>

<p>A taste of opportunity acted on Wahl as the scent of blood stirs
a wolf. It brought his ruthless, tireless news-sense uppermost. He
became as restless as Jack Calhoun and went outside to join his
promenade. Those two were as the poles apart in temperament, but
something remotely resembling a fellow-feeling comforted both of
them as they fell into stride together.</p>

<p>The more Jack Calhoun saw of Wahl, in fact, the less he liked
him; yet, strangely, enough, the less he cared to avoid him. To
keep his mind off his own impatience, he encouraged Wahl to talk,
and Wahl was at least no mealy-mouthed apologist; he made no secret
of his views.</p>

<p>"Then you'd regard a friend's affairs as news, suh&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Anything's news that sells papers. I'm not sold on
friendship. When a man gets over-friendly I suspect him."</p>

<p>"Pardon my curiosity, suh, and don't answer me unless you wish,
but I'm impelled to ask whether you're married."</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>Wahl laughed sardonically.</p>

<p>"You were never in love?" Jack asked him curiously, and Wahl's
smile grew broader than before.</p>

<p>"I've seen a lot of the effects of love," he answered. "It makes
front- page news as a rule."</p>

<p>"Then you don't believe in pure love&mdash;out-and-out
devotion&mdash; chivalry on one side, faithfulness and adorable
dependence on the other?"</p>

<p>"Show me pure love before I'll believe in it!" Wahl answered.
"I've never seen any yet, and I try to keep my eyes open. Devotion,
yes&mdash;to bread and butter and a roof&mdash;or to diamonds and a
limousine. But faithfulness? Chivalry? Who in the world is faithful
to anything except bad habits? Who is chivalrous, when his ambition
is at stake? A woman is a rogue at heart, and a man who adores her
either fools himself like a lunatic, or else he suffers from too
much appetite. The same man would eat himself to death, or die of
drink and drugs in different circumstances. What's more, all women
understand that."</p>

<p>"What a weird conviction! I should say you are the devil's own,
suh! I would rather die than think as you do," Jack remarked.</p>

<p>"I've seen scores die, and thousands go broke for thinking the
orthodox rot about women," Wahl answered. "And I've never met a
woman whose real motives would bear investigation, although I'll
admit to you I've seen great actresses. They're all born with the
buskins on."</p>

<p>"Suh, you astonish me! I would never have believed a man could
walk the earth and hold such notions!"</p>

<p>That pleased Wahl enormously. Like every other newspaper man in
the South, he knew more or less of the Calhoun family history, and
a lot about Jack's escapades. It tickled his sense of humor to be
able to scandalize a man who thought himself made of such vastly
superior clay.</p>

<p>"They should vivisect emotions and traditions instead of
guinea-pigs," he said, "to find out why nine-tenths of the world is
gullible and the other tenth helps itself."</p>

<p>The blood of the Calhouns was boiling, in Jack by then.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, suh," he exploded, "if I were not aware I had
invited your disgusting confidence, I'll be damned if I wouldn't
insult you!"</p>

<p>Wahl grinned more delightedly than ever.</p>

<p>"You might call me the devil's own, for instance!" he
suggested.</p>

<p>During what was left of the short voyage, Jack Calhoun avoided
Wahl as he would never have shunned the devil. When the ship docked
in New Orleans he hurried ashore and vanished, not even troubling
to say good-by to Sherry Mansfield, whom he thought contaminated by
Wahl's company.</p>

<p>"Now, if&mdash;only he'd get into a mix-up with some woman I'd
have a front-page story for the Tribune!" said Wahl, watching him
go. "The Calverly- Calhouns are as well known in Frisco as in New
Orleans. Jack belongs to the two best clubs there, and his father
used to own the Lion Line."</p>

<p>"It's up to you to get some stories, now," laughed Sherry
Mansfield. "Here's a wire from dad."</p>

<p>Wahl snatched it eagerly, fingers twitching and eyes glinting,
but as he read the telegram his expression changed to sour
displeasure.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he exploded bitterly. "Is that all? Special
correspondent in New Orleans for the San Francisco
Tribune&mdash;space rates! Damn! I expected from what you said
they'd send for me to Frisco. However, I'll make it yet &mdash;you
watch!" He met young Mansfield's eyes for a moment, and showed his
teeth in a determined leer. "I'd skin the wives and daughters of
the whole Supreme Court to get on the Tribune staff. Some one's
going to suffer, Sherry Mansfield, but I'll make it!"</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">CHAPTER 8.</a><br>
"You are a prince and I will put my trust in you!"</h2>

<p class="first">The convent was never unbearable, but for the
first time in her experience, Jacqueline began to find it
dissatisfying. The Sister Superior took Don Andres Miro's letter
literally, and "permitted Jacqueline to forget" the unpleasant
incident. But it is possession, not permission, that is nine points
of the law. Jacqueline possessed, and was possessed by, a
sensation. Fluttering heart-beats warned her that though conditions
on the surface might seem almost normal, there was something
dreadful moving underneath.</p>

<p>Even the surface was not what it had been. You may inhibit and
decree, but not the Pope himself can keep young girls from talking,
more particularly in the gigglesome between-bell interludes. Two
girls had told of Jacqueline's love-affair; one hundred and
ninety-nine discussed it enviously; and the one who was silent was
Jacqueline herself.</p>

<p>She was aware she was being talked about and miserable because
the whole trouble seemed so unjust. What was Desmio thinking of it
all? The sting lay there. She had only received one letter from him
since her return to the convent, and in that he had appeared his
usual courteous and generous self, quietly humorous as ever, and as
usual telling her the day-by-day events of the plantation without
as much as a hint that life could ever be less than dignified and
sane. Not a word of Jack Calhoun&mdash;no hidden reference to him,
though she tried through tears to read between the lines. And of
Donna Isabella nothing, except that she was well and wished to be
remembered. That silence was the dreadful part of it.</p>

<p>So she wrote to him in the same vein in which he wrote to her,
giving him the usual news of dancing lessons and of what the
visiting Jesuit lecturer had said&mdash;of a bon mot by fat old
Father Pierre&mdash;and of a broken pane in one of the
stained-glass windows. And she wondered whether Desmio would think
she was a hypocrite.</p>

<p>For he knew about Jack Calhoun now, and she felt sure that Donna
Isabella was busy making as much as possible of the incident. She
knew Desmio would never willingly turn against her; but she also
knew intuitively that, as dropping water wears away stone, a proud
man may be influenced little by little until his judgment is no
longer his.</p>

<p>At last on the day when Desmio should have come there was a
summons instead from the Sister Superior, and with it wild
misgivings. She stood trembling while the calm face watched her
from under the bandeau.</p>

<p>"Don Andres Miro wishes you to return home, Jacqueline. Your
trunk will be packed, and Consuelo will come for you tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>Blue, bewildered eyes&mdash;the puzzling frown&mdash;no, answer
&mdash;only a question!</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;is Don Andres well?"</p>

<p>"I believe so. I have not heard to the contrary."</p>

<p>Jacqueline was hardly conscious after that of the Sister
Superior's voice; certainly no word of the brief admonition that
followed penetrated through the veil of her emotion. She felt like
something blown along by the wind: without volition of her own; and
the wind, she felt sure, was Donna Isabella, blowing cold&mdash;so
cold and comfortless that she shuddered.</p>

<p>"Have you caught cold, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>She did not even realize that she was being spoken to. Fear
gripped her, and was much more dreadful because it had no name nor
any plausible excuse for being fear at all. Somehow she reached her
own room, she knew that, for there she was in the room, on the
chair beside the bed, with Sister Michaela speaking to her kindly,
and her shoes off. Who took her shoes off? Why? She began to
undress herself, and Sister Michaela laughed, although she did not
interfere, and even helped her. Why should she laugh? Was there
anything in the world to laugh about? It was broad daylight, but
Sister Michaela drew the shade down, and how good the pillow felt!
Somebody&mdash;Sister Michaela she supposed&mdash;was folding away
her clothes and moving up and down the little room with
matter-of-fact steps; but all that belonged to a world she had left
behind&mdash;a world that had no more use for her, nor she for
it&mdash;a world whose day-dreams all vanished in a mystery that
she craved nothing better than escape from.</p>

<p>Jacqueline slept until the convent bell at dawn awoke her, and
never a dream had entered to interrupt her visit to the plane where
all is absolute and nothing is unsolved. Sleep wrought its miracle.
She awoke refreshed, and wondering what the turmoil had been all
about. Was she not going home to Desmio? What fear could lie in
that?</p>

<p>She laughed at herself; and was singing all the while she
dressed. She felt gay, and full of spirits. It seemed like the dawn
of something. And the convent, funnily enough, seemed distant,
although she was still in it. Nothing had been said about her not
returning after this visit home, but no logic and no reasoning can
change the promptings of a heart, and she knew, somewhere inside
herself, that she no longer formed any part of those surroundings.
As she knelt by her desk she was conscious of trying to memorize
everything.</p>

<p>Yet afterward, whenever she did call it up from memory, there
always came first that feeling of standing, or rather kneeling on
the threshold of great events. Then, Sister Michaela's face looking
straight at her. Thereafter, always, the gray eyes filled her
memory, and the quiet voice saying:</p>

<p>"Put not your trust in princes! Trust your intuition,
Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>She attended no class that morning. Consuelo came early, almost
with the dew on her from rising before dawn for the forty-mile
journey, and the leave- taking was hurried through as if there were
something furtive about it &mdash;not orthodox and if not frowned
on, wondered at. Yet Consuelo looked so red-faced and important
that Jacqueline, who knew her old nurse nearly as well as the nurse
knew her, could draw nothing but buoyant conclusions. That fat-hen
fussiness hid secrets. Consuelo had good news up her sleeve, or
else Jacqueline knew nothing.</p>

<p>But it was little more than nothing that she learned for two
hours after they left the convent gate. Zeke tooled the car
cautiously along the road below the levee, for the flood was high
and there were places where the mud was hub-deep and the gangs were
toiling to stop further seepage. Whenever Jacqueline asked
questions, Consuelo grew violently worried about the driving and
got into an argument with Zeke through the sliding glass panel.
Zeke's retorts would have made an archangel furious, and Consuelo
naturally did not expect to be an angel for a long time, not even
in the lower ranks. So Jacqueline, although she asked a lot of
questions, ascertained little and that in snatches.</p>

<p>"Why has Desmio sent for me, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>"Zeke you'll break the wheels! I'll report you to Don
Andres!"</p>

<p>"Consuelo, why did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, honey! Oh, that nigger&mdash;he'll be the death of us!
Zeke! Drive slowly!"</p>

<p>"Consuelo, is Desmio well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, honey."</p>

<p>"Why did he send for me?"</p>

<p>"Zeke, you'll be off the road in a minute! Can't you see that
ditch?"</p>

<p>"Consuelo, has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"It will, honey, if that Zeke isn't careful. Zeke!"</p>

<p>"Ah's at de ole stand!"</p>

<p>"Drive faster! If that levee breaks&mdash;"</p>

<p>About a third of Consuelo's nervousness was genuine. The other
two-thirds were a screen behind which she tried to disguise from
Jacqueline that she was nearly bursting with information; and
Jacqueline understood that perfectly.</p>

<p>"There! There's the last of the levee and we're safe. Now you
can tell me the news, Consuelo."</p>

<p>"Just you wait, honey."</p>

<p>"Why? I'll have to know presently."</p>

<p>"All I hope is I can get your hair done properly before Don
Andres sees you. Listen, honey: the less you know the better. Then
if she sees you first, you can tell her what the dodo said to the
horse-marines!"</p>

<p>"Then doesn't Donna Isabella know I'm coming home?"</p>

<p>"There's no knowing how much she guesses, honey. She'll know
something's up when she orders the limousine after breakfast and
discovers she can't have it. Let's hope she doesn't see you first,
that's all. I've prayed to the Blessed Virgin to shut her ears and
eyes for her, and strike her dumb, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Consuelo!"</p>

<p>"Well, I did, honey, and that's the truth!"</p>

<p>"Be still, Consuelo!"</p>

<p>"Honey, I'm too excited. I've got to say something or I'll
burst!"</p>

<p>"Say something nice then about Donna Isabella!"</p>

<p>"All right, honey, I can say it. She may be this and that and
the other thing, and what I know she is. But the day's gone by when
she could do you a hurt."</p>

<p>"Then you've forgiven her, Consuelo? I did. I forgave her
everything this morning at prayers before you came."</p>

<p>"Honey, dear, you can't forgive everything when you don't know
all she's done! And when you do know what she's tried to do, you
can forgive it even less!"</p>

<p>When the limousine rolled under the portico the front door was
open, and Donna Isabella was revealed standing in the hall, a dozen
feet back from the threshold, smiling a bitter-lipped welcome. She
almost ignored Jacqueline, as a stern judge ignores a convicted
prisoner who was once a privileged acquaintance. She knew nothing
of Don Andres' plans, but felt sure that her brother was simply
removing the girl from one convent to another.</p>

<p>"Go to your room," she said, permitting herself to be kissed
respectfully on one cheek.</p>

<p>It was on Consuelo that the vials of wrath were poured. How had
Consuelo dared to take the limousine without permission?</p>

<p>"Answer me&mdash;d'you hear! Don't dare to glare at me in that
shameless manner!"</p>

<p>The din of that salvo brought up the reserves, as Consuelo
hoped. Don Andres appeared, crossing the patio from the direction
of the library. He stood at the end of the hall, looking and
speaking as if he had heard nothing &mdash;seen nothing of the
browbeating.</p>

<p>"Isabella&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned to face him like a she-wolf interrupted. I will speak
to Consuelo."</p>

<p>Don Andres made a gesture of the head and Consuelo followed him
into the patio.</p>

<p>"You have brought her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Don Andres. But I would like to do her hair,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bring her into the library."</p>

<p>Not a word about Donna Isabella. Not even a hint. Yet Consuelo
understood that she was required to offer herself again, if
necessary, as a target between jealousy and Jacqueline.</p>

<p>So Jacqueline came dancing down the balcony steps again, with
Consuelo panting in her wake, and wondered why she should be told
to wait at the foot of the stairs instead of skipping across the
patio and bursting in through the library door after her usual
fashion. If Consuelo's manner had not been so tremulous with
compressed excitement, she might have felt anxious. As it was,
there was a rather pleasant sense of mystery, and she submitted to
be shepherded demurely across the patio, infected by Consuelo's
agitation and thrilled by expectation of something wonderful.</p>

<p>"God bless you, honey!" said Consuelo, and pushed her in through
the library door, closing it suddenly behind her.</p>

<p>As Desmio rose to greet her she looked to him lovelier than she
had ever looked. She wore the same organdie frock in which she had
left for the convent, but no hat now, and there was nothing to
throw in shadow the lake-blue brilliance of her eyes. Her attitude
was half-startled, half-mischievous&mdash;suggestive of Christmas
morning, when gifts lay on the library table and she was sent for
to glimpse them for the first time.</p>

<p>That impression of her held Don Andres silent, as she hesitated
near the door. Her youth, more than her beauty, reached out to him
with a poignancy that was almost pain.</p>

<p>"Desmio&mdash;what does all this mean?"</p>

<p>She ran to him now, and he took her in his arms with a laugh of
unmixed gratitude, kissing her on the forehead, as he always did
when she returned from school. Then&mdash;unusually soon&mdash;his
statelier manner returned, as he retired a pace or two and stood
with his back to the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline!" He very seldom called her that.</p>

<p>"Yes, Desmio."</p>

<p>"I have something to say to you, which I hope you will believe
is said in earnest, after much reflection, and with thought for
your best interests, not mine."</p>

<p>Her heart leaped. Splendid! He was going to tell her what he had
heard about Jack Calhoun! No doubt he had thought of a way out of
the difficulty that would bring no discredit on any one, and
whatever that way was, she would take it unquestioning.</p>

<p>"Whoever seeks to provide for another's future, Jacqueline,
needs wisdom. I have not been altogether wise, nor altogether kind
to you."</p>

<p>"Desmio!"</p>

<p>She stepped closer to lay her hands on him and look up into his
face. Unwise, and unkind? He was wisdom! He was kindness! It was on
her lips to tell him so, but something in his eyes and bearing
warned her that was not the right moment for expostulation. She
waited with parted lips to hear the rest of it.</p>

<p>"I judge myself and I blame myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was altogether too much, and she had to speak.</p>

<p>"Please don't, Desmio!"</p>

<p>He laid one hand on her shoulder, and she nestled close to him,
her eyes a few inches from the watch-chain that rose and fell over
his heart. Why did his heart thump so? Why was he so agitated?</p>

<p>He was outwardly calm enough, and his voice was steady, as he
continued:</p>

<p>"I have inconsiderately placed you in a false position. You have
every right to expect a great deal of this world, yet no means of
realizing expectations. Without me to make provision for you, you
would have very little. And I shall not be here with you
forever."</p>

<p>"Desmio, don't talk like that! I would hate the world without
you in it!"</p>

<p>She did not see him smile as she said that, but she saw the
movement of the watch-chain, and it rather scared her.</p>

<p>"I have consulted the best legal man in Louisiana&mdash;and
incredible though it may seem&mdash;I have not the legal right even
to protect you, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>She wished he would not call her Jacqueline. It sounded so
solemn. What was he going to say? Only she wished he would hurry up
and say it, because this being torn between one emotion and another
was&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can not adopt you, owing to the terms of the Miro trust deed,
according to which none but a Miro may inherit any part of the
fortune. Otherwise I would have adopted you when you first came to
me."</p>

<p>She squeezed his hand, not knowing exactly what legal adoption
meant, but quite sure it meant something dignified and
generous.</p>

<p>"And it is intolerable to me, Jacqueline, that I am in no legal
position to protect you against any one&mdash;a Jack Calhoun, for
instance, or &mdash;or any other individual, who, may have designs
on you of which I disapprove, and, against which you are too
inexperienced to protect yourself."</p>

<p>Good! Jack Calhoun at last! Now she would tell him all about it.
She looked up at his face&mdash;and the words she intended to say
died still- born. She never in her whole life saw him before with
that expression. Was he afraid to tell of his decision? Why else
was he nervous? And yet&mdash;he looked secretly glad about
something.</p>

<p>"Yet, Jacqueline, I am fonder of you by far than I ever was of
my own child. Your father was my closest friend, and Lanier blood
is as good as Miro. I have watched you grow and develop, and I know
that the Miro estates and the Miro name would be much safer in your
keeping than in that of the gum shoe-maker. John Miro is my second
cousin, and a Miro by blood, therefore he can inherit, and will
eventually, unless I can forestall him. He would probably put one
of his gum-shoe advertisements across the front of the house and
asphyxiate the whole neighborhood with the smell of rubber and
sulfuric acid!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed in spite of herself. She knew it was not the
time to laugh, for Desmio was in deadly earnest and was confiding
to her his inmost thoughts. He was not joking about John Miro. He
could hardly bring himself to read a newspaper, because of John
Miro's advertisements that sometimes blared his infamous misuse of
an honored name across a whole page, and San Francisco was as Sodom
and Gomorrah because John Miro lived there!</p>

<p>"But I have thought of a way to defeat that rascal!"</p>

<p>Her heart thumped delightedly. Good Desmio! But had he sent for
her from the convent just to tell her about his second cousin? It
would seem so.</p>

<p>"I have never asked you any return for what I have been
privileged to do for you, Conchita."</p>

<p>Conchita at last! She welcomed it with a smile that would have
melted sterner hearts than his.</p>

<p>"And I would not now unless I was sure I could offer you, in
return for the sacrifice I am going to request, advantages
otherwise beyond your reach."</p>

<p>"Desmio, I will do anything in the world for you!"</p>

<p>"I believe you, dear. That is why I have decided to crave the
honor of your hand in marriage!"</p>

<p>Her heart sank. What did he mean? Could the law make Jack
Calhoun &mdash;</p>

<p>"Marriage to whom, Desmio?"</p>

<p>"To me, Conchita."</p>

<p>"You, Desmio!"</p>

<p>He nodded, watching her. She had stepped a pace away from him.
Her face showed blank astonishment&mdash;bewilderment. She
understood the meaning of his words&mdash;she knew he never said a
word he did not mean&mdash;but it sounded like a
fairy-tale&mdash;like&mdash;</p>

<p>"Desmio!"</p>

<p>"I want you to marry me, Conchita, and to go straight back to
the convent afterward. You will be my wife in name, and when I die
you will inherit these estates."</p>

<p>Every word he added only increased the unreality. She seemed to
be wide awake&mdash;and dreaming! So this was the cause of
Consuelo's suppressed excitement! Thought of Consuelo produced a
smile at last, and the smile grew radiant as she remembered that
whatever Desmio might wish, that would she do with her whole heart,
gratefully. But his next words drove the smile away, and the frown
returned.</p>

<p>"If there were a prospect of my living long enough to handicap
your future, Conchita, I would still endeavor to find some other
way out of the difficulty. However, there is very small prospect of
my living, and by the time you are old enough to form your own
judgment you will undoubtedly be free to exercise it."</p>

<p>She began to want to cry. She knew she would much rather herself
suffer in any way than have anything happen to this generous friend
of hers. She felt he was giving her the greatest gift within his
power, and her heart warned her not to accept it, giving no
reasons, because hearts are autocratic and not talkative.</p>

<p>"One of these days you will meet some splendid fellow, whose
love will be worthy of you, and whom you will love, Conchita."</p>

<p>"No, Desmio! Nobody will ever take your place!" she protested,
and he smiled, knowing what she said was true. But he was equally
aware that he could never fill that other, greater place in her
heart that would open some day.</p>

<p>"I wish to preserve you from present pitfalls, dear, in order
that you may marry happily later on."</p>

<p>"Desmio, how can you talk like that! There's nobody under heaven
like you! I'll never love any one as I do you!"</p>

<p>"You must trust me not to mislead you, Conchita. Very much
wisdom is given to none of us in this world, and I am only asking
you to do what seems best and wisest after a thorough consideration
of all the facts, and after conference with my most intimate
friends. I believe my proposal of marriage is in your highest
interest; and as for myself&mdash;the privilege of having
established you as mistress of these estates will be the utmost I
would care to ask . But the final word is yours, dear. Would you
like time to consider it?"</p>

<p>Time? What difference could time make in her relation to Desmio?
There was nothing he could ask that she would dream of refusing.
And if he loved her so much as all that, it was likely she might
help him to live for twenty years yet. What was her heart tugging
at her for? She stepped up to him and laid her hands on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Desmio," she said, wondering to herself why she should use
these words, "you are a prince and I will put my trust in you!"</p>

<p>"You will marry me, Conchita?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And return to the convent?"</p>

<p>"Desmio, I will do anything you say."</p>

<p>He kissed her on the forehead and she hugged him as she used to
when he gave her extravagant gifts on birthdays and at
Christmas.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">CHAPTER 9.</a><br>
"Do it again, Desmio!"</h2>

<p class="first">No more tugging of the heart-strings now! A new
world, hand in hand with Desmio, full of new thrills&mdash;and the
wildest first! It needs a little fear to make excitement perfect.
There is not much fun in victory unless the enemy has teeth to
gnash! And there was malice, even in Jacqueline Lanier.</p>

<p>Desmio rang the bell; and not for kingdoms, not for her soul's
salvation would Consuelo have missed being first on the scene. She
came in answer to the bell&mdash;curtsied twice&mdash;and was
kissed by Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Oh, honey, I'm proud! Do you see now why I wouldn't say a
word!"</p>

<p>Don Andres cut those congratulations short; but there was a
smile in his eye, and the hand that held Jacqueline's squeezed
harder than he knew.</p>

<p>"Present my compliments to Donna Isabella, Consuelo, and request
her to be good enough to come and see me here at once."</p>

<p>As Donna Isabella entered the library there fell the same
tenseness as when duelists engage and watch each other's eyes.
Desmio, with Jacqueline's hand in one of his, smiled his courtliest
and was no more nervous than his sister. Her face was flint, and
his steel, but his was masked by a desire to carry off the
encounter without unseemliness. He was about to do the courteous
thing in announcing his betrothal to his sister first, and he hoped
she would recognize the courtesy.</p>

<p>"Isabella, I have the honor to present to you my future
wife!"</p>

<p>"Andres&mdash;you're mad!"</p>

<p>Too late he realized the storm was breaking. Donna Isabella
ignored Jacqueline&mdash;scorned her&mdash;conceded her no
ground&mdash;and faced her brother with all the brimstone venom of
her nature uppermost.</p>

<p>"You chicken-hearted fool! You&mdash;"</p>

<p>But not even she could force a domestic scene on him before a
witness &mdash;not, that is, without being turned out of his
counsels forever, which was the last fate she proposed for herself,
since it would leave Jacqueline triumphant. His gesture checked her
in mid-speech. He put his arm on Jacqueline's shoulder and
whispered. Jacqueline ran, as she would run from a
cyclone&mdash;out to the patio, where Consuelo greeted her with
fussy tenderness and a comical, respectful homage due to her new
estate.</p>

<p>"Oh, honey, what did she say to him? Was she furious? Tell me,
honey!"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Desmio sent me out of the room. I'm frightened,
Consuelo. Let's stay and see what happens."</p>

<p>"Come to your own room, honey. He's as good as ten of her!
Nothing'll happen. Come to your room and tell me all about
it&mdash;I'm just simply dying to listen!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline let herself be coaxed upstairs, and from the window
they presently saw Donna Isabella beating a retreat, not looking
blatantly victorious, but so prematurely aged and sour that
Jacqueline was almost sorry for her.</p>

<p>"She called him chicken-hearted!" she said, watching with big
round, reproachful eyes.</p>

<p>"Never you mind what she called him, honey&mdash;it was all
lies! She's down and out, and you'll be mistress in less than a
week! Listen, Conchita &mdash;did he tell you? You're to be married
three days from now! There'll be no time to fix up a wedding like
you ought to have, but Father Doutreleau and I are to do our best
for you. Three days from now you'll be a Miro, and Donna Isabella
takes a back seat!"</p>

<p>Enthusiasm was contagious. Jacqueline knew no more of what
marriage means than any other young girl does who has been
convent-reared, and sheltered. She began to wonder what Sister
Michaela and the other girls at the convent would think when they
heard the news, and which of them should be asked to the wedding,
and what the sisters would say, and what it would feel like to
return to the convent afterward&mdash;a married woman!</p>

<p>"What will I wear, Consuelo? How can I get dresses made in
time!"</p>

<p>"God bless you, honey, we've thought of all that. Don Andres
wants everything as Spanish as can be. So you're to wear the
Spanish costume that he'd ordered in secret from Madrid for you to
wear at your coming-out ball &mdash;nearly all lace, and a
head-dress that 'ud make an angel envious! I'll show it to you
presently, soon as I get my breath back. Honey, you'll be a dream!
And everybody's coming. There's to be a special train from New
Orleans, and reporters from the newspapers; and all the plantation
hands are to have two days' holiday. The house'll be chock-a-block
with guests, and we'll all go crazy but who cares! Roget of New
Orleans has orders to do the catering and spare no expense.
There'll be fireworks&mdash;I thought of that&mdash;and another
thing I thought of was a troupe of dancers from
Brazil&mdash;they've made quite a stir in New Orleans at one of the
theaters, and they're on their way to San Francisco. Oh, you'll
have a wedding, honey, spite of the short notice! Don Andres didn't
say so, but I know he wants it in the papers so's his cousin John
Miro will learn of it and know he can't inherit the estates! Yes,
honey, you're to make a list of your special friends at the
convent, and Zeke'll take it over this afternoon to the Sister
Superior&mdash;just as many as you wish&mdash;only you can't ask
every one, because we'll never know where to put them all as it is.
Yes, honey, Father Doutreleau conducts the service if he isn't dead
of writing invitations and sending telegrams before the time comes.
And before the ceremony there's to be documents signed, with the
trustees witnessing, to make it all yours&mdash;and I can hear
Donna Isabella's teeth gnash now when the pen goes in the ink.
There&mdash;wasn't I a wonder to keep all that in, when you asked
me so many questions in the limousine!"</p>

<p>Consuelo, praised sufficiently, brought out the Spanish dress
from its hiding place all wrapped in tissue-paper, and there was an
hour of unmixed happiness as the dress was tried on. Nurse and
nursling! None understood better than Consuelo the pure profundity
of Jacqueline's innocence. She had kept strictly the letter and the
spirit of Don Andres' instructions, and had never breathed a word
to Jacqueline on the subject of marriage. This wedding, she knew,
was grouped in Jacqueline's mind along with festivals, and going to
the circus, and a hundred other exciting experiences.</p>

<p>So it was Jacqueline's party, only greater fun than any previous
one had been, because to this one grown-ups were invited and Donna
Isabella had no voice in anything. Father Doutreleau and Consuelo
were at pains to accentuate Jacqueline's youthfulness, rather than
to veil it in pretended womanhood; the wedding was a fiesta in her
honor, at which Jacqueline was simply to be one party to a legal
contract, the church consenting. So Donna Isabella's grim
displeasure was forgotten in the whirl of exciting events.</p>

<p>In the seclusion of her own apartment, Donna Isabella sulked
like Achilles, until she actually had to send for Beal to treat her
for vertigo.</p>

<p>But only Beal knew about that, and he was a man whose disability
for conversation amounted almost to genius. He said nothing, and
not even Father Doutreleau guessed the extent of the jealousy that
was eating the arrogant heart out. Beal looked worried when her
name was mentioned, but Beal always looked worried about something;
and the one dark domestic who was admitted to Donna Isabella's
apartment did not even dare to discuss her mistress in the
servants' hall. Don Andres' courteous inquiries, sent in twice
daily, were ignored, and he was having to be much too careful of
his own health to think of seeking her and arguing her into a more
reasonable attitude.</p>

<p>A marriage in the Miro family could never be less than a
nine-day wonder in Louisiana. This suddenly announced match between
the middle-aged Don Andres and the seventeen-year-old Lanier beauty
caused more local stir than any war in Europe ever did; and even
Europe learned over the wires what was about to take place, since
Andres Miro was persona grata at more than one European Court and
had friends everywhere. There was not a prominent newspaper in the
United States, or in any of the capitals in Europe that did not at
least mention the news briefly, with the consequence that
cablegrams and telegrams arrived in shoals. Beal thought it safe to
let Don Andres answer some of the telegrams; but he soon regretted
it. There came one from San Francisco which aroused such prodigious
anger that for a while he feared for his patient's life.</p>

<p>"Congratulations. I last saw Jacqueline when she was seven years
old, and if the promise she showed then has fulfilled itself she
must be fully worthy of the Miro traditions. Why not grace the
great occasion suitably by shaking hands? John Miro."</p>

<p>"Hypocrite! Cad! Renegade!"</p>

<p>Andres Miro crumpled up the telegram and hurled it through the
window. He was pierced through the joints in his armor, and not all
the self-mastery he had learned in fifty years could suppress his
indignation. He could pity a criminal, be courteous to an impudent
enemy, forget gross injury&mdash;but forgive John Miro and his
gum-shoes, never!</p>

<p>It needed Jacqueline and all her understanding sympathy to
restore him to a state of mind in which Beal dared to leave him.
And what stopped him at last was the realization that Jacqueline
was laughing!</p>

<p>"You laugh, Conchita. You astonish me! I am ashamed to have
sworn in your presence."</p>

<p>"Do it again, Desmio," she giggled. "I like it! It always sounds
vulgar when other men swear. You do it with such distinction.
There's nobody like you in the world!"</p>

<p>"You must forget that you heard me, Conchita."</p>

<p>She shook her head, and the lake-blue eyes laughed merrily. "You
said what I feel, Desmio!"</p>

<p>For a moment he was puzzled, and she did not explain, but the
least little gesture of her head toward the open window gave him
the clue to her thoughts. He smiled at last, and the two nodded
understandingly.</p>

<p>There came a sharp dry cough from outside the window. Donna
Isabella had left her apartment, and would be present at the
wedding ceremony after all.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">CHAPTER 10.</a><br>
"Let me speak to her!<br>
Just one word with her!"</h2>

<p class="first">The wedding was set for afternoon, to allow for
the arrival of the special train from New Orleans, and to give
guests from neighboring counties time to come by motor. The
dining-room and Don Andres' private chapel being much too small for
all that crowd, a bower of flowers was set up in the garden, where
the ceremony might take place in full view of every one. The
wedding breakfast was to take place in the patio directly after the
ceremony, and an army of experts took charge of that; the patio
looked like a hanging garden in ancient Babylon roofed by a canopy
of flowers, under which the gargoyle fountain took on the
resemblance of a heathen idol grinning four ways
simultaneously.</p>

<p>By dawn the plantation darkies were already celebrating; by nine
o'clock the whole countryside was swarming through the grounds, for
there was no question of Don Andres' popularity, and no doubt that
anything he might do would be worth recording in the annals of
Louisiana. Grand seigneurs are a dying race, and out of fashion,
but liberal when they let the bars down. There were probably a
thousand guests, invited and uninvited (the papers said three
thousand); and there were a thousand reasons for being there, not
least of which was curiosity, which Jacqueline assuaged in
full.</p>

<p>She was here, there, everywhere, enjoying the supreme day of
existence and lovelier than blossom in the spring&mdash;first, down
where the darkies were holding high festival and dancing mad
breakdowns to melodeon and drum; then, back into the garden by the
rear porch where Ramon the Brazilian and Pepita with her monkey
repeated their entertainment that had made a hit in New Orleans;
next, at top speed to the front door when the bus arrived from the
convent with two sisters and as many of Jacqueline's schoolmates as
could be crowded in. Then all to be done over again, because her
friends and the sisters must see everything. And from first to last
she was unconscious of the fact that she&mdash;her own innocent
self&mdash;was the paramount attraction.</p>

<p>She had to be hunted for, and brought back from the farthest end
of the grounds, when Curtis Radcliffe arrived with the legal
documents and spread them before the trustees and Don Andres on the
library table. Living each hour as it came, with dignity, Don
Andres chose that that ceremony should be as August as the signing
of a treaty between nations; so when Jacqueline came at last, with
Consuelo, and Sister Michaela and, two girl friends, there was
another long pause while some one went in search of Donna
Isabella.</p>

<p>She arrived dressed in black, and refused to be seated, but
stood glaring at Jacqueline across the table. Her face was like a
death's head. Deep dark rings under her eyes betrayed the ravages
of jealousy&mdash;that weapon whose hilt is sharper than its point
and cuts deepest whoever uses it. None spoke or smiled after she
came in&mdash;not even Jacqueline when she wrote her name on the
line at Radcliffe's gestured invitation and gave the gold pen back
to Desmio. It was he who at last broke silence:</p>

<p>"Isabella, will you sign your name next, at the head of the list
of witnesses?"</p>

<p>He forced a smile, and his manner was deferent and courteous,
but she answered him in a cracked dry voice from which the very
juice of civility was squeezed:</p>

<p>"I refuse to be a party to this outrageous proceeding. I give
you notice now, Andres, that my rights under that trust deed must
be respected to the last letter."</p>

<p>She turned her back at that and left them, marching down between
the flower-laden tables in the patio toward the drawing-room, like
gloom's ambassador.</p>

<p>Donna Isabella paused in the hallway. The front door was open
and it was hard to see into the light, but the footman was
answering the questions of some one whose voice she thought she
recognized. In another second she knew it; Jack Calhoun's! Her eyes
gleamed, as she met his and beckoned him into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"So you've come!"</p>

<p>"By God, I've come! But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've come too late!"</p>

<p>"Donna Isabella, what does this mean? It's an outrage! It's a
rape, that's what it is! That old man marrying
Jacqueline&mdash;it's incredible."</p>

<p>"It's true!"</p>

<p>"Are they married already?"</p>

<p>"No, but this afternoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I'll stop it! Donna Isabella, that girl loves me! I heard
of this last night&mdash;saw it in the evening paper in New
Orleans, and rushed to my lawyer's house to find out if he knew
anything. He did, by gad, and he spilled the beans! Believe me, I
mean to see Jacqueline and have this out with her! Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"H-s-s-h! If Don Andres learns you're here, he'll prevent you
from seeing her."</p>

<p>"Don't tell him, then! Let me see Jacqueline alone a moment. If
not, I'll go to Miro and denounce him for a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"H-s-s-h."</p>

<p>Donna Isabella's face looked mischievous, and Jack Calhoun could
be shrewd at that early stage of excitement. Storming tactics were
the basis of his whole philosophy of life&mdash;go get it, and the
devil take the hindermost!&mdash;but he could pause and browbeat an
ally into line with him. He imagined he was forcing Donna
Isabella's hand, as every Calverly-Calhoun has always thought
himself the master of whoever designed to use his energy.</p>

<p>"It won't do any good. You're defeated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not while there's breath in me!"</p>

<p>"If you want to see Jacqueline your only chance is to go into
the garden and wait for her there."</p>

<p>"I'll do that."</p>

<p>He was in the mid-stride for the door, turning his head to nod
one of his swift adieux, when something in Donna Isabella's eye
arrested him. She looked too satisfied to suit him&mdash;too
mischievous.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're not side-trackin' me?" he asked. "'Cause,
if you think to do that, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"H-s-s-h! Close the door again. I had hopes,&mdash;I regret
you're too late&mdash;If I could prevent this ridiculous wedding,
there is nothing would please me better."</p>

<p>He nodded. He was shrewd enough to believe her; not so shrewd as
to guess that her sole motive was to submit her brother to scandal
and indignity.</p>

<p>"Keep out of Don Andres' sight," she warned him; and he nodded
again, and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>It was easy enough. There were crowds in the patio, and on the
rear porch; crowds on the steps watching Ramon the Brazilian and
his mother Cervanez, whom every one supposed was his wife; more
crowds around Pepita and her monkey&mdash;crowds in the garden
again. Jack Calhoun shouldered his way through, avoiding all who
might have recognized and greeted him, and took his stand on the
outskirts of the largest crowd of all, where people were gaping at
the reporters and their cameras. From that point of vantage he
watched the rear door and the steps, down which Jacqueline would
have to come in order to reach the garden. He pulled his watch
out&mdash;gave her fifteen minutes. If she did not appear within
that time he would reenter the house and look for her. He hardly
had his watch back in his pocket when a voice accosted him.</p>

<p>"An unexpected pleasure! Glad to meet you again, Mr.
Calverly-Calhoun."</p>

<p>Jack turned with a smothered oath of disgust, and looked into
the eyes of Clinton Wahl.</p>

<p>"What are you doin' here?" he demanded. His manner and tone of
voice indicated that what Wahl was doing interested him less than
anything on earth.</p>

<p>"Oh, just covering the wedding."</p>

<p>"Thought you were a star in the newspaper firmament. D'you
condescend to this sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"As a rule I don't," said Wahl. "But doesn't a marriage between
a seventeen-year-old beauty and a millionaire of fifty-five strike
you as interesting news?"</p>

<p>"Suggests cradle-robbing to me!" Jack snorted, and Wahl grinned
ingratiatingly. He scented a real story at last. Recalling
conversations on the steamer, he was not blind to the possibility
that Jack Calhoun might be in love with Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Have you known Miss Lanier long?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Longer than I've known you," Jack answered rudely, and moved
off. Whereat Wahl was convinced that it might pay him well to keep
both eyes open. He could eat up impoliteness as a cormorant
swallows fish, but he flattered himself none had ever snubbed him
without paying for it. "Let's see&mdash; called me 'The devil's
own,' didn't he? Good head-line that: 'Jack Calhoun sups with the
devil!' Has he brought a long spoon, I wonder? He looks to me
full-cocked on a hair-trigger. He'll bear watching."</p>

<p>So Wahl, who had been candidly bored by the whole proceeding,
chose a garden seat behind a bank of roses, whence he could keep
Calhoun in view without that individual knowing it, and began at
last to take what he called a human interest.</p>

<p>Jack gradually edged his way back again toward the foot of the
steps, where Ramon and Cervanez were finishing a dance. He was
hardly noticeable in the crowd when Jacqueline appeared at last on
the porch above him. She certainly did not see him. She stood with
each arm around a girl friend, laughing as the crowd turned away
from the Brazilians to cheer her. Some one cried out that she
should dance at her own wedding, and that started a tumult of
applause, she hanging back and her girl friends pushing her
forward, until suddenly Don Andres himself appeared and added his
voice to the rest. It was out of all question to refuse him. She
nodded, laughing, and the guitar and mandolin orchestra that had
played for the Brazilian struck up a Spanish air as she came
running down the steps to the stone-paved path below.</p>

<p>Glancing back at Desmio for his approval, she commenced one of
those lively Castilian dances that make of modesty a grace adorning
motion. Her girlish figure, supple, and strong, and young, lent
itself more perfectly to those than to any other steps imaginable,
and they had taught her at the convent, as they did whatever they
touched, thoroughly. Ramon, the Brazilian, watched, nudging his
companion and commenting under his breath, as she rose to the
occasion&mdash;wine of applause in her head&mdash;blue eyes alight
with happiness&mdash;and danced more wonderfully than her teachers
ever guessed was in her, until even Desmio's enthusiasm broke
bounds and Beal and Father Doutreleau, each taking an arm, forced
him back into the house.</p>

<p>If Jacqueline had known that Jack Calhoun was there, and if she
had deliberately sought to set his heart on fire, she could not
have bettered that performance!</p>

<p>Clinton Wahl left his hiding-place behind the roses and,
beckoning an assistant from over near the cameras, came as close to
Jack Calhoun as he could without attracting his quarry's attention
to himself.</p>

<p>"Go and see what sort of car Jack Calhoun came in, and who's in
it now. If it's a chauffeur, get word with him. Look the car over.
Find out anything you can, and bring back word to me," he
whispered.</p>

<p>The assistant hurried off, anxious to please Wahl, whose word in
a cub- reporter's favor might go far toward promotion. Wahl edged
nearer yet to Jack Calhoun. He knew the signs that herald
violence&mdash;knew by the look in Calhoun's eye, and by the
taut-drawn tenseness of his attitude, that a story of some kind was
going to break, and break swiftly, and soon.</p>

<p>He heard Ramon the Brazilian whisper to Cervanez next to him: "A
touch &mdash;a pinch more daring&mdash;a week's experience and she
would beat us all!" And he made a mental note of that, for use in
his story presently, but he never once looked at Jacqueline until
she ceased dancing and ran back up the steps amid storms of
applause. Then Calhoun thrust himself forward through the crowd,
and by the expression on his face Wahl knew that Jacqueline had
seen him. It was then that he spared a moment to glance at her, and
caught the look of guilt, as he diagnosed it, that checked her
laughter and made her seem suddenly afraid.</p>

<p>Wahl's cavernous eyes grew bright then, and his lips set
tightly. There was no more mercy on his face than on a weasel's.
News! He scented it!</p>

<p>Jack Calhoun pushed his way through the crowd, and ran up the
steps just as Consuelo came out of the house in search of
Jacqueline. Wahl saw Consuelo interpose her bulk between the two,
while Jacqueline stood hesitating, obviously in a panic, wondering
whether to run or stand her ground. Wahl judged he might get
thrashed if he followed Calhoun, so he started to run around the
house with the idea of entering by the front door and coming on the
party from the rear. Nobody noticed him.</p>

<p>"Senor Jack, what do you want?" Consuelo demanded angrily. She
was afraid, but stood her ground, and he could not get past her to
Jacqueline without knocking her over, a stage of violence that he
had hardly yet reached.</p>

<p>"Word with Miss Jacqueline! Out of my way&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>"No, Senor!" Consuelo glanced over her shoulder. "Run,
Conchita!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline fled through the door, and Consuelo fought a
rearguard action, retreating backward and actually wrestling with
Jack Calhoun. Fear lent her strength. She blocked the door ahead of
him, aware that Jacqueline was hugging the corner less than a yard
away.</p>

<p>"Shall I call the servants, Senor Jack?"</p>

<p>"Dammit, Consuelo, I'll get even with you for this! Let me speak
to her! Just one word with her!"</p>

<p>"No, Senor!"</p>

<p>Jack Calhoun drew a bow at a venture, and the shot struck, but
not as he intended.</p>

<p>"Donna Isabella said I might."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you, Senor! She must give me that order
personally." Then over her shoulder, "Run, Conchita! Run!"</p>

<p>So Jack Calhoun saw one exasperating glimpse of Jacqueline as
she fled along the passageway; and even he knew better than to
follow at that moment and create a scene inside the house.</p>

<p>"I'll report you to Donna Isabella," he said savagely, and
turned his back.</p>

<p>So all that Wahl saw, as he came hurrying along the passage, was
Consuelo, panting and as red-faced as a turkey-cock, but looking
proud enough to face a hundred kings.</p>

<p>"Anything happened? Been an accident?" he asked sharply, using
that voice of authority that cracks so many nut-shells for the
press.</p>

<p>"Have you heard there's to be a wedding?" she retorted.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Calverly-Calhoun?"</p>

<p>"Smoking," she answered meaningly, and sailed past him, leaving
him to draw his own conclusions. Wahl went in search of
Calhoun.</p>

<p>Consuelo found Jacqueline in her room, pale-faced and as nervous
as a young bird in view of a hawk.</p>

<p>"What shall I do, Consuelo? You said he was in Cuba,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do nothing, honey. I've attended to him. He has her permission,
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell Desmio."</p>

<p>"No, no, honey! Don't you give him another thing to worry over
and strain that heart. We'll manage this between us. You go to Don
Andres now&mdash;he wants to talk to you&mdash;and I'll find two or
three gentlemen&mdash;Mr. Addison, and Mr. Mowblay, and Mr.
Cartwright&mdash;they'll do. They'll fix Mr. Calverly-Calhoun so
he'll know where he belongs."</p>

<p>"Don't let them hurt him, Consuelo! He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Conchita&mdash;he's in love. He needs cold water.
The horse-pond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They mustn't, Consuelo! I won't have it! Listen to me! He's a
gentleman, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The blue-blooded senor twisted my wrist till the skin nearly
came off the flesh! I'll show the wrist to Mr. Addison, and see
what he says. Now listen, honey; pull yourself together, and then,
when you're all calm, run down to Don Andres. Don't tell him a word
of this, but be quick back. I'll be waiting for you. You must hurry
and get dressed, or you'll be late for your own wedding!"</p>

<p>The old nurse's fingers picked and pulled, setting Jacqueline's
frock to rights, and rearranging her hair, so that in a minute the
traces of panic were beyond all discernment by masculine eyes. Any
woman would still know she had been terrified, but even women would
set that down to stage fright.</p>

<p>"Now, be quick, honey&mdash;and use those blue eyes! Smile at
him!"</p>

<p>She crossed the patio under close guard, Consuelo elbowing her
between the tables; and as usually happened, the moment she entered
the library all nervousness left her and she smiled naturally. Don
Andres rose to greet her with even more than his usual eagerness;
but the outworn heart was being overworked, and he nearly collapsed
against the armchair. "Pardon me, Conchita."</p>

<p>Iron will now, and nothing else, was holding him together. He
managed to master himself&mdash;to joke about his
infirmity&mdash;to recover and sit upright on the arm of the chair,
and even his eyes grew bright again; but he was burning up his last
strength, and Jacqueline was aware of new anxiety, a thousand times
more poignant than her recent dread of Jack Calhoun.</p>

<p>"What is it, Desmio! Are you keeping something from me?"</p>

<p>"Conchita, I keep nothing from you. My heart, my life, and my
possessions are all yours! I invited you to come, that I might make
you my final gift before the wedding."</p>

<p>He put an ancient locket on a golden chain over her head.</p>

<p>"That chain and locket were a wedding gift to the wife of the
first Miro in Louisiana. Every Miro's wife since then has worn it,
and the loveliest last!"</p>

<p>She opened the locket and looked inside it, not knowing what to
say. It contained his portrait, done by hand on ivory.</p>

<p>"Desmio!"</p>

<p>"You are pleased with it?"</p>

<p>"It is the best of all gifts."</p>

<p>He smiled, but he was least of all men prone to
self-deception.</p>

<p>"But a day will come, Conchita, when you will wish to put some
other lucky fellow's portrait in there."</p>

<p>"No, Desmio! Never!"</p>

<p>"When the day does come, remember that you have my
leave&mdash;that I would wish it&mdash;that my one hope is that the
fortunate man may be worthy of you!"</p>

<p>"There won't be any one else!" His words and his gentle way of
speaking made her want to cry, but she battled bravely with it. "I
love this gift best, I'll wear it always!"</p>

<p>"I would be grieved," he answered, "if I thought your loyalty to
me could spoil your future happiness or your love for some one
else. In the years to come will you try to remember that?"</p>

<p>What did he mean? She nodded, because she could summon no words
to answer him. Nor could she force herself to ask him what he
meant. Thoughts came to her, that she dared not face&mdash;that she
shut her mind against. And then came memory of Sister Michaela's
warning: "Trust your intuition, Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>How trust it, when it told her nothing? All she could feel was
vague fears, and not on her own account but Desmio's. What could be
the use of trusting that? Should she believe then that he was
dying? What then? Should she refuse at the very last minute to
marry him? Would that help? Would it save his life?</p>

<p>"What troubles you, Conchita?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Desmio&mdash;at least nothing that I
understand&mdash;just thoughts." She could not force herself to lie
to him.</p>

<p>"Tell me them."</p>

<p>"How ill are you, Desmio?"</p>

<p>He looked startled; she had caught him for once off guard.</p>

<p>"Not seriously ill, Conchita. I need rest, that is all. We Miros
have iron constitutions."</p>

<p>"I feel you are in danger, Desmio."</p>

<p>He laughed&mdash;an old swordsman's ringing laugh. What did he
care about danger! He was safeguarding her and in less than an hour
she would be mistress of the Miro fortune. Let happen after that
what might!</p>

<p>"I am in love," he answered mockingly. "They tell me love is
always dangerous. But there&mdash;who is knocking?" He called, and
Consuelo opened.</p>

<p>"Come, Conchita! Quickly, honey, or I'll never get you into your
dress in time."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">CHAPTER 11.</a><br>
"By God! The devil's own!"</h2>

<p class="first">Consuelo worked with nimble fingers, tying this,
adjusting that, while Jacqueline did her best not to move too often
at critical moments. But you can't stand still before a
looking-glass&mdash;not while a wedding frock is being hung on you
that looks as if angels made it in a lacy paradise beyond the
clouds. You absolutely must turn suddenly to see how it looks
behind; and if you don't jump excitedly, and sway your supple body
to see how perfectly it fits about the waist and under the arms,
you're not human and seventeen.</p>

<p>It was all so exciting and wonderful that it drove Jack Calhoun
out of mind, until Consuelo glanced at the clock and caught her
breath.</p>

<p>"In seven minutes, Conchita! And I haven't found Mr. Addison, or
Mr. Mowblay, or Mr. Cartwright. Stay here, honey, while I run and
look for them again. I'll be back in a moment."</p>

<p>So Jacqueline stood alone, not in love with her own reflection,
because she could not make herself believe that the marvelous being
in the mirror was not some one else altogether&mdash;a stranger
whom she did not know: but in a rapture, nevertheless. It was all
much too good to be true, and too wonderful to be real. So she went
down on her knees and prayed, turning away from the glass that she
might give full attention to the prayer. And so she did not see the
door move open, and though she heard it, she supposed it was
Consuelo coming back. It was when she rose, from her knees that she
saw Jack Calhoun's reflection in the mirror.</p>

<p>He was standing with his back to the door, and the door shut
tight behind him. She was too afraid of him to scream. She could
not speak. She could not ask him how he dared to be there. But
intuition told her that the act of prayer had been her
sanctuary&mdash;that he had not dared to approach her while she
knelt. She turned toward the bed to throw herself on her knees
again and bury her face in her hands, but he sprang between her and
the bed and would not let her kneel.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>That broke the dream-spell. It was real then! Besides, she could
feel him &mdash;he had hold of her wrist, and it hurt&mdash;and her
own heart was fluttering so wildly that it nearly choked her.</p>

<p>"Go away!" she cried suddenly, and tried to release her wrists;
but his grip was like iron. His eyes burned in a way that terrified
her, for they seemed not to see her dress at all, but to look
through it and make her creepy and ashamed. His breath came in hot
gasps through parted lips.</p>

<p>"I will go away, but I will take you with me, Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>She felt her knees weakening under her, but knew she was not
going to faint; there was nothing merciful like that in sight. She
opened her mouth to scream, but not a sound came, or if it did she
never heard it, for Jack Calhoun began pouring forth excited words
that dinned in her ears, and she felt like a bird in a trap, too
paralyzed by fear to move or do anything.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline! I love you, and you love me! You know it!"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You can't love old Andres Miro! He can't make you marry him!
He's old enough to be your grandfather! I won't permit it! I'm
takin' you out of this! Come on!"</p>

<p>He tugged at her wrist. All she could do was to shake her head
violently and hang back.</p>

<p>"Come on, dear! Don't be afraid!"</p>

<p>But he was frightening her horribly. She saw the humor of that.
It was funny that he should terrify her so, and tell her not to
feel fear. A smile flickered on her lips for half a second.</p>

<p>"There! That's better! Once you're out of the house he hasn't a
legal leg to stand on. I've a car outside, and when you're in that
and away he'll have to sit down and cool off! I've a marriage
license&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>He pulled it from his pocket, shaking it so violently before her
eyes that it might have been blank paper for all she knew.</p>

<p>"Come on, Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>He shoved the license back into his pocket and made as if to
pick her up and carry her. She felt his strong arm around her, and
it was that that gave her power of speech; fear grew so acute that
it broke its own spell.</p>

<p>"No! Go away, please! You mustn't stay in here another
second!"</p>

<p>"Not another second!" he answered, laughing like a maniac; and
he threw the other arm around her and tried to kiss her. How she
did it she never knew, but she escaped him, and part of her veil
came away in his hand. There was a chair between him and her now,
but she could not have answered how it got there.</p>

<p>Something in her face and attitude seemed to arrest him. She was
gaining strength&mdash;mental strength, womanhood was dawning.
Never in her whole life until now had she stood and faced danger
alone. Her very innocence was coming to her aid.</p>

<p>"You are not behaving like a gentleman!" she said quietly. "Go
out of here!"</p>

<p>He laughed more like a maniac than ever.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline! Do you love that old man? Are you crazy? Are you
fool enough to throw away your young life, when you know I love
you! God! It's horrible! Tell me&mdash;do you think you love
him!"</p>

<p>She was actually calm now. Dimly she was beginning to comprehend
strange mysteries. She could pity him. "You don't understand," she
answered. "I don't love anybody in the way you mean. I love Desmio
because he is noble, and generous, and good. I don't love you at
all."</p>

<p>She had said too much. Jack Calhoun did not believe one word of
it, and all the blood of all the Caverly-Calhouns rose boiling at
opposition. He desired. She could see the madness in his eyes, and
shrank away from it; but a wolf does not sheathe his fangs because
the lamb is frightened. His hand went to his pocket, and she
glimpsed the butt of a pistol.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline, I'll kill you before I'll let you marry that man!
Come away with me now, or take the consequences!"</p>

<p>"Leave the room at once!" she answered, stamping her foot.</p>

<p>Now it was he who had made the wrong appeal. She was not afraid
of that. She would rather be killed than submit. Her eyes met his
gravely, but their challenge only stirred his passion to the point
where he lost all self-control. He pointed the pistol straight at
her heart.</p>

<p>"I'll kill you, Jacqueline, if you don't come with me!"</p>

<p>He hesitated, hoping she would yield, for he saw sudden fear in
her eyes &mdash;and did not know the door was opening behind him.
She saw Desmio. He only saw her sudden change of expression.</p>

<p>"I'll love you forever if you come away with me. If
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does this mean, sir?"</p>

<p>The voice in the door was like the ring of tempered steel, and
Jack Calhoun turned on his heel swiftly. One of Don Andres' hands
was behind his back&mdash;the other on the door-knob. It was true,
Don Andres might have had a pistol in his right hand, but Jack
Calhoun was long past the thinking stage. He acted on
impulse&mdash;aimed&mdash;and fired.</p>

<p>Thereafter nightmare&mdash;all a wild dream, blurred&mdash;yet,
burned into her memory. Don Andres, face forward dead&mdash;shot
through the heart; and the first into the room was Clinton Wahl,
cavernous-eyed, with a mouth that smiled like the satyr's on the
gargoyle fountain in the patio. He glanced down at Don Andres, not
even stooping to see whether he still lived. Three strides, and he
was face to face with Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"By God! The devil's own!"</p>

<p>That was jack Calhoun's voice. It was followed instantly by a
second pistol-shot. Wahl scarcely turned his head. One swift glance
showed him Jack Calhoun with a hole in his brain, lying bleeding on
the rug beside the bed. His eyes on Jacqueline's again,
fascinated&mdash;froze her cold.</p>

<p>And because her heart felt dead, her very soul numb; terror and
grief and amazement made her sick and weak; because all her
universe had crumbled and was swept away in a moment&mdash;that
little frown danced and trembled on her forehead over the clear
pure eyes, and it seemed to Wahl that the eyes were mocking
him.</p>

<p>Cherchez la femme!</p>

<p>He seized her wrist, as Jack Calhoun had done. "What happened?"
he demanded. "Tell me all about it!" And she knew she hated him ten
times worse than she had ever dreamed of hating Donna Isabella.</p>

<p>"Come on now&mdash;tell me!" he repeated. It was he who
preserved her from actually fainting, for she hated him so that it
gave her a connecting link with consciousness.</p>

<p>Pity? There was no more pity for her in Clinton Wahl's mind than
a vivisectionist has for the stray dog he tortures. This was the
story that should get him transferred to the Tribune. News!
Front-page headlines! Feed the public what it wants, and it will
make you famous! He shook her.</p>

<p>"Now out with it! How did Calhoun get in here?"</p>

<p>Then Consuelo&mdash;hurrying in like a hen whose one beloved
chick is in danger&mdash;hustling Wahl&mdash;boxing his ear with a
stinging smack like another pistol-shot, that did nothing to soften
Wahl's asperity. Then Father Doutreleau. And then the crowd.</p>

<p>Memory grew vaguer after that. She knew she flung herself on
Desmio's body &mdash;and there was blood on her hands and on the
torn bridal veil, and in blotches on the lace of the Spanish dress.
She knew she kissed his lips, but they were lifeless. Next, she was
sobbing on Consuelo's bosom, being petted, and drawing no comfort
whatever from the words:</p>

<p>"Oh, Conchita! Oh, my poor child! Oh, my baby!"</p>

<p>She did not want to be comforted. There was nothing left she did
want &mdash;no Desmio, nor anything in all the world except Wahl's
hateful eyes and leering lips, accusing her&mdash;accusing
her&mdash;of what? And Desmio dead! Did he think she had killed
him? That million-times worse brute than Jack Calhoun&mdash;did
he&mdash;didn't he know she would have torn her heart out with her
own hands rather than let one least injury be done to Desmio!</p>

<p>Jack Calhoun had he shot himself, or had Wahl killed him? She
was vague about that. She could only remember Jack Calhoun's bitter
laugh and his last words:</p>

<p>"By God! The devil's own!"</p>

<p>Was Wahl the devil? He looked like it!</p>

<p>Then along the balcony and downstairs, Consuelo coaxing her, and
across the patio between the loaded tables amid a murmur of voices,
under the gaze of what felt like a thousand eyes, with her face all
smothered in her veil on Consuelo's shoulder; and once&mdash;only
once she looked up. Why? What made her do it? Was there no
hiding-place? Was she in hell? For there stood Donna Isabella
blocking the way in front of her between two tables, glaring and
pointing with a lean forefinger at the blood on her hands and
dress.</p>

<p>"You wicked, wicked girl! Is that my brother Andres' reward for
caring for you?"</p>

<p>Suddenly a smash&mdash;of crockery she supposed&mdash;and a
chorus of "Oh! Ah! Say! Did you see that?" Consuelo threw a plate,
or a dish, or something at Donna Isabella, and upset the table, and
everybody cried out. And what became of Donna Isabella she did not
know, but the next she remembered she was burying her face in the
pillow on the bed in Consuelo's room, and Consuelo was trying to
get her wedding dress off, sobbing, and crying.</p>

<p>"Oh, Conchita! Oh, honey! Oh, my poor darling baby! Oh, how
could the Holy Virgin let this happen!"</p>

<p>The door was locked, for she heard people knocking but no one
could get in. Once Consuelo went to the door, she remembered, and
scolded through it &mdash;scolded scandalously. There were threats
from some one in the passage, and she thought she heard Wahl's
voice, and cried out!</p>

<p>"Don't let him in! Don't you dare let him in! He's the devil,
Consuelo!"</p>

<p>After that there was nothing to remember except agony of mind
and emptiness&mdash;grief too dreadful to be recognized for what it
was, transmuting itself into physical pain, when her thought grew
too numb to register impressions, and racking her whole body in
nervous torture until she screamed aloud. No unconsciousness. No
peace. No hiding-place from something indescribable&mdash;not a
thought, for it had no name&mdash;nor a thing, for it was
shapeless&mdash;but a haunting pale-green fear that she felt, that
she knew would hound her until she turned on it.</p>

<p>And she was too afraid to turn on it&mdash;did not know how. And
Desmio was gone forever. She cried aloud to God to bring him back
to life and to let her die instead of him, while Consuelo tried to
comfort her, coaxing.</p>

<p>"Hush, honey! Hush, Conchita! Oh, my baby dear, you don't know
what you're saying, child! Oh, honey dear, do hush!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">CHAPTER 12.</a><br>
"Me&mdash;I'm made!"</h2>

<p class="first">Wahl was in his element. First on the
scene&mdash;the only man who had thought of watching Jack
Calhoun&mdash;witness of the last half of the
tragedy&mdash;personal success at stake&mdash;he went to work with
the cold determined zeal of the kind that crowns efforts. He could
visualize the headlines, even hear the newsboys, while he conned
the situation.</p>

<p>He made no notes, asked hardly any questions. No need. It was
Wahl's fingers that removed the marriage license from Jack
Calhoun's side-pocket; his eyes that read it first; and he put it
back into the pocket lest the other reporters should see it too
soon and spoil his "beat." He had all the makings of a perfect
scoop.</p>

<p>Jacqueline Lanier&mdash;beautiful, young,
talented&mdash;convent- reared&mdash;cold-hearted&mdash;dancing
like Herod's daughter, while her lover looked on, throwing smiles
to the gray-haired Miro, whom she was presently to marry for his
money&mdash;guiltily startled as she sees her
lover&mdash;flight&mdash;the lover pursues her to her
bedroom&mdash;knows the way to it!&mdash;the lover pleads, offers
to marry her at once, and shows the license&mdash;she sneers and
refuses. Enter old Miro. High words. Double tragedy! Outcry?
Fainting? Not a bit of it! Calmness&mdash;eyes full of mocking
laughter! A modern Borgia! A Catherine de Medici at seventeen!
Herodias!</p>

<p>Principals&mdash;the richest and best known planter in
Louisiana, cousin of the famous gum-shoe magnate! The profligate
son of the famous Frank Calhoun, who owned the most successful
blockade-runners in the Civil War and afterward founded the Lion
line of steamships in San Francisco&mdash;a man as well known in
California as in the South! The orphan daughter of the last of the
Laniers, a family that for generations past had been intimate with
all the highest in the land, and the beauty of whose women was a
by-word. Perfect! Why ask questions? Let the League of Nations and
the next elections rot! Wahl had a story&mdash;a whale of a
story!</p>

<p>There were questions, though, that he did ask. He had a gift for
going straight to the meat of things and probing sources others
overlooked. He found Donna Isabella&mdash;forced his way into her
apartment&mdash; scandalized her into hysteria&mdash;and by darkly
hinting that she might possibly be blamed, induced her to scream
her version at him.</p>

<p>Jacqueline was a heartless, impudent, designing minx, who had
nearly broken Don Andres' and her own heart by flirting with Jack
Calhoun, and then had hypnotized Don Andres to the point of
marrying her, so that she might have his money and estates! But she
had missed her mark, thank heaven! Don Andres' death had come an
hour too soon, and she was penniless. She, Isabella Miro, who had
loved the girl and had tried to be kind and affectionate, had been
rewarded by a plate of cakes thrown in her face. Mr.&mdash;what was
his name?&mdash;Clinton Wahl must excuse her from further
conversation; she was crushed on account of her dear brother's
death. And if truth were in question, she looked it. Wahl bowed
himself out, and heard the key turn on the inside. Perfect! She
would see no more reporters.</p>

<p>An effort then to find Jacqueline and force a confession from
her; but there he failed. He discovered which room she was in by
the sobbing and the cries of Consuelo trying to comfort her. He
hammered on the door&mdash;used threats&mdash;tried to force the
door down with his shoulder. But Consuelo answered threat for
threat, and vowed she would kill him if he passed the
threshold.</p>

<p>Then occurred what might have enlightened Wahl, if he had been
seeking light and not sensation. There came a Negro footman down
the passage; Wahl offered him twenty dollars to help force the door
down. He was not much of a Negro&mdash;none too big; but he and
Wahl could have broken the door between them. He showed the whites
of his eyes, and Wahl raised the offer of twenty dollars to fifty.
The next he knew, he was reeling backward along the passage from a
smash in the jaw from the footman's fist. There was plainly some
one in the house besides her nurse who thought the world of
Jacqueline. Negro footmen don't hit white men in Louisiana without
knowing they undertake a gruesome risk. Wahl might have drawn
deductions, had he seen fit.</p>

<p>But rubbing his jaw, he ran into the garden, and around the
house in search of the window of Consuelo's room&mdash;found
it&mdash;heard sobbing&mdash;and started to swing himself up on the
window-sill. A Negro gardener came running, threatened him with a
rake and began shouting for help. One beating by a Negro was enough
for even Wahl's enthusiasm, so he ran for his car and drove off in
a whirl of dust for the nearest telegraph office, mapping out his
story while he broke all speed-laws.</p>

<p>He would be in time for the evening edition in New Orleans and
San Francisco, provided he rushed and had the copy at his finger's
ends; and that was his specialty&mdash;all brain work and no
notes&mdash;clean copy, headlines and all. He could dictate it
straight to the telegrapher if only the fellow had sufficient
skill.</p>

<p>"Hunches beat a full house! I'd a hunch to cover this wedding,"
he reflected. "Gee! The story of the year, and my first to the
Tribune! I'll bet I'm on my way to Frisco in a week! I'd a hunch
Jack Calhoun would break out on the front page presently&mdash;and
holy smoke, that Lanier girl's a pippin! Me&mdash;I'm made!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">CHAPTER 13.</a><br>
"Facts presented with a punch!"</h2>

<p class="first">There were no women on the San Francisco Tribune
staff. John Covert Mansfield so decreed&mdash;the "Iron Old Man,"
whose vitriolic pen and point of view, reinforced by a beaver's
energy, had raised the Tribune from tenth to third place among
daily newspapers. He was more than owner and managing editor; he
was the power, the newspaper itself, and notorious as the ablest
and most exacting editor alive. It was an education&mdash;a cachet
for advancement elsewhere&mdash;to have worked under Mansfield on
the Tribune.</p>

<p>He had a son, so he must have had a wife, and there was a
legend, seldom mentioned, that an unfortunate marriage had
embittered him against all women. "Dad" Lawrence, the Tribune's
social reporter, who had been on the paper longer than any one
except Mansfield himself, knew more about the facts than he
generally cared to tell. "Dad" was privileged&mdash;almost intimate
with Mansfield&mdash;even had a key to Mansfield's so-called
"cabin" in the mountains and spent his rare vacations up there, and
was about the only man in the Tribune Building who ever dared to
oppose the old man's wishes or to criticize him to his face.</p>

<p>Once in a while, when the subject cropped up in some
twenty-minute breathing spell between editions, Dad would have a
word or two to say. He never entered into details, but he had his
own philosophy of life, which differed in most respects from that
of the Tribune as chalk does from cheese.</p>

<p>"I never married&mdash;and for the same reason that the old man
never should have; only in his case there's ten times more reason.
Look at him, he has a hotel apartment, that he visits every other
day or so, and there's even a telephone beside the bath. Most
nights he sleeps on a couch in the office, and grudges the time
spent eating and shaving. Eighteen hours out of twenty-four, he
works; during five, he's asleep, more or less; that leaves an hour
for meals and all the rest of it. Where does a wife come in? He
married the Tribune when he took it; over-tried for a while to be a
bigamist&mdash; and failed. I don't blame Mrs. Mansfield, or any
other woman who would kick under such conditions. I don't blame
Mansfield either. He's the Tribune. That's all there is to
him."</p>

<p>"He's sure got teeth!" said Barnes, the city editor. Barnes had
just come out from a stormy session with Mansfield and spoke with
feeling.</p>

<p>"He knows news! He can smell it. I believe there's something in
his bones that tells him half an hour before a story breaks,"
remarked Gunning, of the telegraph desk. "He's restless now."</p>

<p>"You bet he is!" said Barnes. "He'll walk me, if I don't step on
her."</p>

<p>"He knows what the public wants, that's his secret. And he feeds
it to 'em peppered and smoking hot," said Gunning. "Here she
comes!&mdash;I told you
&mdash;special-rush&mdash;exclusive&mdash;Clinton Wahl&mdash;that's
the New Orleans man&mdash;hello&mdash;Calverly-Calhoun&mdash;that's
the Lion Line outfit&mdash;Miro&mdash;Lanier&mdash;Gee whiz! Boy!
The whole bench is asleep, Goddamit! Boy!"</p>

<p>Two minutes later Mansfield strode in, holding a roughly
scribbled sheet of copy-paper in his right hand. He took no notice
of any one, except the three at the telegraph desk at one end of
the big news-room, where Dad and Barnes were watching Gunning.
Gunning, pencil in hand, was reading telegrams, with his left hand
ready to snatch the next sheet from the operator at the desk beside
him. Saying nothing, Mansfield looked over Gunning's shoulder,
watching for several minutes as sheet after sheet of Wahl's message
came off the wire.</p>

<p>"Special!" he said, nodding. "Great stuff. Now, boys, for God's
sake don't mess it this time! Boy! Tell Mr. Trig I want him." He
pulled out his watch. "We've forty minutes. Make over the whole
front page and spread this on four columns thirty-six point head.
Spike the Board of Trade stuff. Dad&mdash; cover Calhoun, and all
the dope about his father. What do you know of the Laniers? Dig 'em
out of the morgue, and play it uprush now!"</p>

<p>Dad ran to his desk. Trig came hurrying from the stone, wiping
black hands on a cotton waste and dashed away again, grinning.
Mansfield returned to his office to telephone the circulation
manager, and a new, acute, accentuated din was added to the normal
clatter of the news-room as the story of Jacqueline Lanier was
rushed through the string of miracles that tread on one another's
heels in the throes of birth of a special edition&mdash;until the
huge building began to tremble to the thump of mighty engines, and
the big vans backed into the alley-ways to receive the finished
bundled copies.</p>

<p>In the pause that followed, when the last big van had roared
away, Dad strolled into Mansfield's office and found him reading
the front page, smiling over it.</p>

<p>"That's a good story," said Mansfield, looking up at Dad and
laying down the paper. "I'm going to send for Wahl."</p>

<p>"He has a fair 'rep,'" Dad answered.</p>

<p>"'Rep' be damned! He has brains! He's turned in a big beat! Give
me one a day like that, and I'll treble the circulation. Look at
his stuff compared with yours! Good God, you've written up the
Calverly-Calhouns as if they'd just donated something to the
Y.M.C.A.&mdash;and the Laniers&mdash;old ladies' tea-fight! Read
Wahl's stuff. There's a man who knows how to cover a story."</p>

<p>Dad picked up the paper and read the heavy black type down to
the foot of the column. (His own was on the inside page.)</p>

<p>"It's sensational enough," he said presently.</p>

<p>"Sensational? It's facts presented with a punch,"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's cleverly written," Dad conceded. "There's nothing
there, I suppose, that's libelous. But suppose the facts have been
misrepresented? Her reputation's gone. It's cruel."</p>

<p>"Cruel? So is life!" said Mansfield. "We're face to face with
life. Our business is to let the public know what's going on. News
is the breath they breathe, and we supply it."</p>

<p>"That's the dope ring's argument, and the bootleggers' standby,"
Dad retorted. "They claim they give the public what it wants. The
question is &mdash;just what is news?"</p>

<p>Mansfield laughed. Dad's point of view always amused him. He
liked the man, and kept him on the paper more because he dared to
beard him in his den than for any other reason.</p>

<p>"News is neither law, nor religion, nor morals; it's sometimes
about law, religion and morals&mdash;sometimes about other things.
How often must I tell you that?" asked Mansfield with an air of
rather weary patience. "The public pays, and calls the tune. We
dance to it. A paper has to interest the public and anything that
interests it is news. Come over here and watch."</p>

<p>He walked to the window and beckoned Dad to follow him. For
several minutes they stood in silence watching the home-going
crowds on the sidewalk and the newsboys at the street-corner over
the way yelling the "EXTRA" &mdash;"DOUBLE TRAGEDY!" headlines.
They were selling papers as fast as they could hand them out.</p>

<p>"That, Dad, is news and what it does," said Mansfield. "A peace
conference in Europe, or a political convention, would sell less
than half as many papers. That's why I'm sending for Wahl, and why
I'm troubled about my boy, Sherry."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with Sherry?" demanded Dad.</p>

<p>"Nothing but a sentimental streak. He's soft somewhere. He's
bright &mdash;did splendidly at college&mdash;and he's keen. I've
taught him to mistrust women, and done all I can to toughen him. I
don't think he'll fall for the usual traps and he'll go
far&mdash;but run a successful newspaper? &mdash;I doubt it. A man
like Wahl may do him good. I think I'll let Sherry work under Wahl
for a year or so."</p>

<p>"I've never met Wahl," Dad answered, "but I love Sherry. He's
the nicest boy I know. I've read Wahl's stuff, and I hate it. My
bet is that Sherry has guts enough to stand off you and Wahl both,
and to carve his own line."</p>

<p>"We'll see," said Mansfield dryly. "Wahl has promised us a
two-page feature and some photos for the Sunday Section. Let's hope
he lands a good one of the Lanier girl. Get all you can about Jack
Calhoun's record in Frisco, and be ready to feed Wahl the minute he
comes. Let Wahl write the stuff, but feed him facts. And by the
way, when Wahl comes, treat him nicely. Take him for a week-end to
my cabin in the mountains, or something. Now get out of
here&mdash;I'm busy!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14">CHAPTER 14.</a><br>
"Consuelo&mdash;what is a coroner?"</h2>

<p class="first">Women suffer more than men. For millions of years
they have undergone the agony, while men provided it. Capacity to
suffer is inherent in the whole sex, and to recover and forget in
the joy of having brought forth. But where was joy for Jacqueline
Lanier? What had she brought forth but disillusion?</p>

<p>She lay on the bed in Consuelo's room during uncounted hours,
eating when Consuelo told her to, not knowing what she ate, not
caring what should happen, not even trying to escape one pang of
grief; for she hoped the grief would kill her. She did not cry any
longer; there was nothing left to cry about. She did not pray;
there was nothing to pray for. When Consuelo knelt and prayed
before the image of the Virgin on the little table in the corner,
she watched and wondered dumbly what was the use.</p>

<p>Consuelo did much more than pray, however. She saved
Jacqueline's life &mdash;saved her reason. She recognized the
instinct, that humans share with animals, to hide in a dark place
when wounded. Consuelo drew the shades down, set furniture against
the door, and held that fort against all comers, not wasting words
on her patient when her own first paroxysms of despair were over,
but watching, letting nature take its own course.</p>

<p>And it was no joke holding that fort. Police&mdash;one lone
policeman, rather deferent, extremely curious, and not so sure of
his rights. Then Donna Isabella.</p>

<p>"You may pack up and leave the house at once, Consuelo. I'm not
going to keep you a minute longer."</p>

<p>"You never kept me yet! I'm here in spite of you! I'll go when
I'm ready, and no sooner!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, I'll have to have you put out!"</p>

<p>"You dare! Just you dare, that's all! Wait and see what I'll say
at the inquest! Wait till they ask me on oath who sent me with a
letter to the convent from Calhoun! Wait till I've told all I know
about you! I've not talked to the reporters yet. Turn me out of
here, and straight I go to them!"</p>

<p>"You're a false, ungrateful, wicked woman!" snarled Donna
Isabella. "What is Jacqueline doing in your room?"</p>

<p>"Dying, for anything you'd care!"</p>

<p>"She may go to her own room and stay there until I send for
her!"</p>

<p>"She'll do nothing of the sort!"</p>

<p>"Well, your wages ceased yesterday. And Jacqueline has no claim
on the estate. She may take her own belongings, but you may tell
her not to look to me for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She'll find she has more friends than you have!" Consuelo
snapped, and slammed the door in Donna Isabella's face.</p>

<p>None of those encounters made the least impression on
Jacqueline, though they were noisy enough. She heard, and simply
did not care. Donna Isabella's venom stung no longer, and there was
no future&mdash;could be none&mdash; nothing but the vision of
Desmio lying dead in a pool of blood, with Wahl's terrible face
looking into hers and saying "Now then, out with it!" She buried
her face in the pillow and screamed when she thought of Wahl.</p>

<p>"It was the devil, Consuelo! Jack Calhoun cried out he was the
devil's own! He haunts me!"</p>

<p>"Hush, honey dear. You've never seen the devil and never will.
Try to forget him."</p>

<p>"I can't. I see his face all the time!"</p>

<p>"Come, Conchita, drink a little warm milk, there's a honey, and
then sleep."</p>

<p>She was obedient, but she could not sleep. But there was no time
when Donna Isabella's malice slept. They brought her the New
Orleans papers &mdash;four or five of them&mdash;and all with
screaming headlines, photographs of Don Andres Miro, Jacqueline,
Jack Calhoun, and even of herself. Of leaded type the shame of the
Miros stared her in the face, a million times more degrading than
the gum shoe-maker's half-page display on the back sheet.</p>

<p>Only one paper&mdash;Wahl's&mdash;the New Orleans Star gave her
any comfort. As she read that she almost forgave Wahl for having
dared to burst into her room. That paper told the whole truth. It
showed up Jacqueline &mdash;described her as a monster of
iniquity&mdash;pictured her as a vampire, with two love-affairs at
seventeen, and a laugh on her lips and lying eyes when the bodies
of lover and aged bridegroom lay dead at her feet.</p>

<p>But, oh, the black, aching shame of it! The Miro name dragged
into the mud! The Miro pride humbled for the mob to laugh about!
They spoke of the inquest, and of the facts that were expected to
be brought out, of the witnesses who would be
examined&mdash;herself, Consuelo, Jacqueline, the servants. She the
proudest woman in Louisiana, was to be pilloried in public and
browbeaten by a shoddy coroner&mdash;confronted with Consuelo's
lies no doubt&mdash;and all because of Jacqueline!</p>

<p>Well, Consuelo and her tongue notwithstanding, at least she
would show that girl what she had brought down on the house that
had befriended her. She hunted for her keys. There was a pass-key
on the ring, that opened all doors in the house except those behind
which Don Andres had kept his private papers. Then she rang her
bell.</p>

<p>"Let me know when Consuelo goes to the kitchen. Don't say a word
to her."</p>

<p>Spite ran its full course. Donna Isabella tiptoed along the
corridor, and entered Consuelo's room, closing the door quietly.
She laid the copy of the New Orleans Star on the pillow close to
Jacqueline's face, and stood watching, thin-lipped, saying nothing.
But Jacqueline did not stir.</p>

<p>"Read it!" she said suddenly, and Jacqueline looked up at last,
but showed no surprise, no interest.</p>

<p>"Read it, you wicked girl, and see what you've brought down on
others!"</p>

<p>She pointed to the newspaper and left the room, not exactly
anxious to be caught in there by Consuelo. Jacqueline sat up and
held the paper to the dim light coming through the blind; and the
first thing she saw was her own portrait! Then Desmio's and Jack
Calhoun's enclosed in circles in the middle of the page. Then,
slowly, big black type took shape, and she could not tear her eyes
away from it.</p>

<p>Each line she read was like a stab at the heart which she had
thought could feel no longer. Was this what the world would now
believe of her? It likened her to Herodias*&mdash;and she knew that
story. It called her a seventeen year-old Jezebel. It as good as
said she had killed Desmio, and that she laughed to see him lying
dead. It said her eyes mocked the reporter, and that she threw
crockery in the face of the aged Donna Isabella, in the presence of
scores of people, because Donna Isabella sent her to her room. It
said she had locked herself into her room and would be seen by
nobody, but hurled foul invective through the door when any one
tried to gain admission. It said she would be haled before the
coroner&mdash;whoever he might be &mdash;and made to give
explanation; that the courtroom was expected to be crowded</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Herodias</i>&mdash;a Jewish princess

<p>"Who is the coroner?" she asked quite quietly, as Consuelo
entered with the beef tea. It was the quietness of absolute
despair, and Consuelo recognized it.</p>

<p>"Mother of God! Who gave you that, child? Where did you get the
newspaper?"</p>

<p>Consuelo snatched it away from her and tore it up savagely. She
had already seen a copy in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Donna Isabella brought it in. What is a coroner, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>"That woman's worse than a murderess! Here, honey, be good now
and take some beef-tea!"</p>

<p>"Consuelo, I want to know what a coroner is."</p>

<p>"Never you mind, honey."</p>

<p>"I must know. You must tell me. I'm to be hauled before a
coroner tomorrow afternoon. What is a coroner?"</p>

<p>"Take your beef-tea, honey!"</p>

<p>"Not until you tell me what a coroner is."</p>

<p>"He's a sort of judge, dear. He'll ask questions, and you'll
have to answer him."</p>

<p>"I won't! I won't answer people who believe those things of
me!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to, honey. It won't be so bad. I'll be
there, and I'll sit beside you while you just say yes or no to what
he asks you. Then we'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't go, Consuelo."</p>

<p>"But they'll make you, Conchita. They'll come and fetch you, and
me too, honey. You must make up your mind to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's made up! I shall not be here when they come for me,
Consuelo. I won't answer people who believe those things of
me!"</p>

<p>"Honey dear, don't talk nonsense."</p>

<p>"I'm telling you the truth."</p>

<p>"Conchita, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'm going away."</p>

<p>"Where, honey?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm just going. I shall not be here when they
come for me."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the note now. It was calm, without
emphasis, without trace of hysteria. But she would go, or she would
die. It was Consuelo who felt hysterical.</p>

<p>"But, Conchita, you've no money, and nowhere to go, and none to
look after you&mdash;and the Holy Virgin knows you can't look after
yourself."</p>

<p>"I'm going."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Now. Tonight."</p>

<p>"Honey dear, don't be absurd! D'you think I'd let you go? Be
good now, and take your beef-tea, it's getting cold. You couldn't
walk&mdash;they'd find you in an hour!&mdash;and who's to carry
your things? You can't go without anything!"</p>

<p>"I'm going, Consuelo."</p>

<p>"Take your beef-tea, honey. Would you leave me to face it all
alone?"</p>

<p>"You may come with me if you wish," Jacqueline answered, in the
same quiet voice.</p>

<p>Consuelo set the cup and saucer down and cried; but it was no
use. Jacqueline was unemotional, but firmer than a rock; no longer
terrified, long past the stage where fear could touch her. There
was a courage in the blue eyes now, and the hint of a faraway
vision, as if she saw one little ray of hope beyond the edge of
things. It unnerved Consuelo, and then made her stare until she
crossed herself and shuddered. She knew it was no use urging; she
must give in, or there would be another death, or madness on her
hands.</p>

<p>"Sister Michaela told me to trust my intuition. That's why I'm
going, Consuelo. I'm going to turn my back on everything."</p>

<p>"Honey dear, wait until morning. We can't walk. We must take
clothes with us. I've money in the savings bank, and we can draw
that out. Give me until morning, and I'll pack meanwhile and see if
I can't get a car, and some things to eat in a basket,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We must be gone before daybreak, Consuelo."</p>

<p>"Honey, you're too impatient! They don't open banks that early,
and &mdash;</p>

<p>"You needn't come unless you want to. I'd just as soon go
now."</p>

<p>"Will you go to sleep, honey, if I leave you and pack your
things?"</p>

<p>"If you promise, Consuelo."</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise, dearie. We'll go before daylight, even if we
have to walk."</p>

<p>Jacqueline let her head fall on the pillow and was asleep within
five minutes, relaxed, and breathing steadily. So hope can change
all in a moment. There was something certain&mdash;one step visible
ahead; and the past was gone; and youth resumed its sway. Consuelo
watched her for a while; then, sure she was sleeping, locked her in
and hurried by the back way into the garden&mdash;down through the
gate in the wall at the end, and across three fields in the dark to
a row of cottages where the colored hands lived.</p>

<p>"Zeke! Zeke!"</p>

<p>"Here I is, Miss Consuelo."</p>

<p>Only the glow of his pipe and the whites of his eyes were
visible. He was sitting on a log under the shadow of a tree between
two cottages, and his manner was much more deferential than it had
been recently; he even got to his feet and set his thumb over the
bowl of the pipe. Consuelo paused to get her breath, and took in
the situation with a general eye.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? Why aren't you indoors?"</p>

<p>"There's ha'nts in there, miss."</p>

<p>"Are you a good Catholic, Zeke?"</p>

<p>"Ah is, but Ah's scared mos' nearly daid."</p>

<p>"That's because you took the bribe from Mr. Jack
Calhoun&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Consuelo, you ain't gwine tell ag'in me 'bout that 'fore
de coroner?"</p>

<p>"If we weren't here, we wouldn't have to go before the
coroner."</p>

<p>"Where's we gwine?"</p>

<p>"You may drive Miss Jacqueline."</p>

<p>"Where's she gwine?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind. She'll tell you. If you're outside the garden
gate with one of the cars an hour before daylight, the coroner can
whistle, can't he?"</p>

<p>Zeke shook his head, beginning slowly and increasing the speed
until the whites of his eyes made a horizontal streak in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Dey's done locked de garage, an' took mah key."</p>

<p>For a second, Consuelo was nonplussed, but she had laid bare
Zeke's obsessing terror, and pursued her advantage blindly.</p>

<p>"Can't you get another car? Not for Miss Jacqueline's sake? Not
to do a good deed for Don Andres now he's dead? Remember, the
coroner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where's Ah gwine git him, honey?"</p>

<p>"Horses then?"</p>

<p>"Yo' means plantation horses? Dey's some. Dey's mos' dat ole
dey's 'bout daid. Bes' ones was all 'spatched fer de 'mergency.
Dey's haulin' dirt for de levee t'ree days now." .</p>

<p>"Well, if there are two left, you can take them without being
seen, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Ah s'pose."</p>

<p>"Take one of the old four-wheel buggies from the barn, harness
the two best horses, and be at the garden gate an hour before
daylight, Zeke. If you're there, and hold your tongue, I'll hold
mine. You understand me?"</p>

<p>"Dat buggy hain't had no grease put in him sence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grease it yourself, then, you lazy nigger! I can't waste time
talking to you. Either you do or you don't; which is it? I shall
tell the coroner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Consuelo, Ah's yo' bes' frien'! Ah's gwine grease dat
buggy good. Ah's gwine drive you-all anywhere! Ah sho'ly is."</p>

<p>"If you're late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah's gwine be dere, miss!"</p>

<p>But Zeke's promise was nothing much to build on; there were too
many possibilities of greater fears that might occur to him, or
that he might take some one into his confidence, or be seen taking
the horses, and Consuelo returned to the house with her heart in
her throat.</p>

<p>She found Jacqueline awake again and already dressed, moving up
and down the room restlessly, packing Consuelo's clothes into a
straw valise&mdash;to save time, as she explained it&mdash;with no
more idea what to pack, and what to leave behind, than she had of
where she was going.</p>

<p>"There, Conchita&mdash;wasn't that thoughtful of you!"</p>

<p>Consuelo swallowed her chagrin and left her occupied while she
crept up to Jacqueline's room and crowded bare necessities into a
dressing-bag, including all the jewelry&mdash;wry-faced as she
reflected that the trinkets and the few good stones were only too
likely to change owners presently.</p>

<p>That task accomplished, she began to wish she had ordered Zeke
to be ready sooner. She used up an hour undoing Jacqueline's
handiwork, and another fifteen minutes foraging in the larder for
provisions to take with them; but then there was nothing left to do
but sit and wait&mdash;hour after interminable hour of inaction,
with Jacqueline demanding to know why. Once she went out to find
Zeke, but failed in her search, and that only increased anxiety. If
Zeke had decided to run away on his own account, as was quite
likely, they were done for!</p>

<p>"Where shall we go?" she asked at last, hoping to give
Jacqueline something to occupy her mind. She had made up her own
mind on that point long ago.</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere."</p>

<p>"We'll go first to the city, honey, where I can find something
to do. I'll try the employment agencies, and then perhaps I can get
something in another state and take you along. But we mustn't take
the train from our station. We must drive thirty miles to the
junction, and buy tickets in the wrong direction, so's to put them
off the scent."</p>

<p>"Have you any money, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>"Enough for the fares, honey."</p>

<p>More than an hour before Zeke was due they were waiting for him
in the shadow of the garden wall, startled by every sound and
racked with anxiety. But a buggy that had not been greased came
squeaking through the dark at last, and they climbed in, Zeke
saying nothing.</p>

<p>"Drive along the levee to the junction, Zeke."</p>

<p>"Dat ole levee's per'lous near bu'stin'!"</p>

<p>"Did you hear me tell you!"</p>

<p>"Sho&mdash;Ah ain't deef&mdash;Giddap!"</p>

<p>And so they left behind the haven of Jacqueline's girlhood and
girlhood with it. Desmio's mansion and the wall surrounding it
passed away behind them into darkness like a dream, and were out of
sight when morning came. But Jacqueline never looked back for a
last glimpse; some sort of future had been born in travail and
heavy labor; the past was dead, and she had no more use for it, nor
it for her&mdash;nor much use for the future, though it had begun
to glimmer dimly, like the morning, when the creaking wheels
moved.</p>

<p>There was a light mist like a bridal-veil along the bottoms in
the shelter of the levee, and she thanked heaven for it, since,
though the wheels squeaked a mournful warning to all the
countryside, they were hardly visible at twenty paces. And they
passed very few people, even after daybreak. Those who saw them
were mostly Negroes, and all hurrying one way in answer to the
whistles that announced danger at a point along the levee&mdash;the
awful summons to every able-bodied man to turn out and help pile
dirt. None of those straggling, sparse laborers was likely to turn
back and report having seen them.</p>

<p>Later, they began to pass fugitives driving cows and hurrying
toward them in carts loaded high with household goods. Those
shouted warnings that terrified Zeke nearly out of his senses. The
levee looked like breaking at a point about a mile ahead.</p>

<p>"She ain't agwine las' anuvver hour! You-all bes' turn dem
horses aroun'!"</p>

<p>Zeke elected to follow that advice, but the wheels were in soft
ruts nearly hub-deep and though the horses plunged under the whip
they only nearly broke the pole, and one of the wheels cracked
ominously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Oh, what'll we do? Oh, honey dear, you'll drown!"</p>

<p>More fugitives came pouring down on them, blocking the road, and
Zeke jumped on to a passing cart, yelling to them to follow suit.
Consuelo wrung her hands in impotent despair, and then bethought of
her image of the Blessed Virgin, which she had packed in the straw
suit-case with underwear tucked carefully around it. She crossed
herself, unpacked it, held it up:</p>

<p>"Now!" she cried. "Now! I've prayed to you often enough!
Preserve us now!"</p>

<p>It was Jacqueline whose courage rose to the occasion. Fear
seemed to hold no further terrors, or if it did, she faced the
horror that she did not know in front, in preference to the terror
she had turned her back on. She climbed up to the driver's seat and
took the reins that Zeke had draped over the dashboard.</p>

<p>"Conchita! Conchita! You're crazy! Come down here!"</p>

<p>But the buggy went forward with a lurch and Consuelo sat down on
the rear seat suddenly. They plunged into the mist, that by a freak
of wind had gathered suddenly and rolled toward them. Out of the
mist and silence ahead a man's voice cried out&mdash;a mile, or a
hundred yards away, there was no telling, but as clear as the
summons of Judgment Day:</p>

<p>"Christ! She's going, boys! Jump!"</p>

<p>Something thundered like wind in a sail, and the horses reared
and broke the pole at last. There came a roar like a waterfall. The
levee on their left hand broke apart like lumps of chocolate on the
edge of a cake. The world shook. Three converging floods of
dark-brown water, darker than the mist and yet a part of it, swept
down on them exactly as the scenes change in a dream. The panorama
swung. Dream-horses, kicking madly in the tangled harness, came
over backward into the buggy on a dark-brown wave.</p>

<p>"Conchita!"</p>

<p>"Consuelo!"</p>

<p>Two screams, drowned in the deafening roar of water, and then a
sense of being swept along forever, whirling, whirling, tossed up
and down again, half-conscious, in a skirt that wrapped itself
around helpless legs, with logs and dead things, and the timber of
broken houses plunging to right and left&mdash;a momentary glimpse
of sky&mdash;then mouth, eyes, all under water again&mdash;up once
more, to gasp and cling to something that gave way&mdash;again the
deluge.</p>

<p>Jacqueline was glad! She was drowning&mdash;dying! She felt
young again! Her heart sang, the while her lungs ached and her ears
tortured her, and every nerve and instinct in her fought for life!
She struggled without knowing it&mdash;clung to branches without
knowing that she clung&mdash; welcomed death, and fought it as a
young life fights forever&mdash;until a barn-roof swinging in
mid-stream, nearly knocked the last life out of her, and she held
on, not knowing that she held. A great branch, backed up by an
eddy, hove itself from beneath her. Roof and branch turned inward
in opposing circles, and the movement tossed her, unconscious at
last, on the roof as it whirled away downstream.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15">CHAPTER 15.</a><br>
"Conchita!"</h2>

<p class="first">To Wahl's surprise, and hardly veiled contempt,
Sherry Mansfield declined to be shown around New
Orleans&mdash;refused to take lunch&mdash;did not wish to be
introduced to local celebrities&mdash;consented to visit the Star
office, but turned down Wahl's handsome offer to send him as his
own substitute to cover the Miro wedding, news of which had just
come in over the wire&mdash;and asked nothing but to be led to the
best garage in town, where he might hire a car in which, as he
called it, to head up-country.</p>

<p>"I told you what the floods'll be," said Wahl.</p>

<p>"My dad said floods. I'll cover 'em!"</p>

<p>"You'll learn to take his orders and put your own interpretation
on them some day," Wahl assured him.</p>

<p>"Wait till you've met dad."</p>

<p>So Sherry bought blankets and a thermos bottle, chucked the lot
into a hired car, invented a rig to hold his typewriter so that he
might use it on the run, and ordered the darky driver to follow the
left bank of the Mississippi until further orders.</p>

<p>"Step on her. I'll pay the fine," said Sherry. "If there is a
flood, I'll write it!"</p>

<p>After four days of tireless activity, he learned what fifteen
minutes' inquiry in New Orleans would have supplied him at no
expense&mdash;the exact position of the real danger-point. And
there he planted his car with its wheels hub-deep in mud, face to
the enemy, and waited, writing down the symptoms of the sick brown
bank. He knew to a decimal point how many tons of dirt the
dump-carts brought&mdash;how many thousand bags of sand were
piled&mdash;how many men were working. And the levee held. Sherry
Mansfield nearly wept.</p>

<p>He was mortified when Wahl showed up in a big car, late one
afternoon and turned his satyr-smile on the situation. If he could,
he would have sunk into the ground before Wahl saw him, but there
was very little that Wahl did not see&mdash;even to the brief-bag
full of typewritten description.</p>

<p>"Glad I found you, youngster."</p>

<p>Sherry made note of the change of address, and was not too glad,
and looked it.</p>

<p>"You missed a big thing when you turned that wedding down.
Double tragedy. Best story of the year."</p>

<p>"Wait till the levee breaks!"</p>

<p>"It won't. Never does when it's watched. I wired the story of
that wedding to the Tribune. Your dad sent for me at once&mdash;got
his wire last night. Thought I'd do you a turn in
exchange&mdash;you see, I owe it to you two ways; for recommending
me in the first place, and for making me cover the wedding myself!
So I decided to catch the Limited at the junction, and make it by
road on the chance of running into you. I've brought a copy of the
paper&mdash;here, take it&mdash;whole front page."</p>

<p>Sherry took the paper absent-mindedly and stuffed it in his
pocket, which annoyed Wahl.</p>

<p>"Be advised, and read it, youngster. That's a story. It's what
got me on the Tribune."</p>

<p>Sherry looked rather more interested, but his eye was on the
levee all the while, and on a man in overalls on top of the bank
who stood remarkably still, with his hands in his pockets,
whistling. Wahl continued:</p>

<p>"It occurred to me you'd like a chance to clean up on the story.
You'll get more of it than from the Mississippi in a hundred years.
I've got to go &mdash;I'm wired for, and the Limited won't wait.
You pick up the story where I left off. It's your big chance!"</p>

<p>Sherry met his eyes&mdash;nodded&mdash;looked back at the levee.
He was hardly listening.</p>

<p>"The girl's name's Lanier. Jacqueline Lanier. Get her story from
her own lips. I hadn't time to make her talk, and she won't see any
one, but they'll haul her out before the coroner tomorrow; but
she's one of those deep-eyed wise ones, who won't tell much. You
use your wits and get next to her somehow. Believe me, you'll have
a story you can sign!"</p>

<p>Sherry glanced down at the paper protruding from his pocket and
smiled politely.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, "I'll read it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm off. See you in Frisco, I suppose. Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Sherry, suddenly remembering to shake hands.
"Good of you, I'm sure. Thanks awfully." He had almost forgotten
the incident&mdash;had forgotten the paper entirely, before Wahl's
car was out of sight. He was dreaming dreams and seeing
visions&mdash;planning&mdash;letting ideas come to him from where
they would&mdash;imagining a future Mississippi Valley, drained and
safely banked with all the flood-waters stored up a thousand or
more miles away&mdash;being a boy with a man's brain. The boy
watched like a lynx to see the mud-bank go. The man schemed
reconstruction.</p>

<p>It was the whistling man with hands deep in his pockets on the
levee who invited him at last to join him in a launch and see the
night patrol through by water.</p>

<p>"Suit yourse'f, son, but of you'll excuse me the observation,
you seem interested. If so minded, you may sleep, suh. But if you'd
keep that searchlight moving in the bow, you'd see more, and help
me. How about it?"</p>

<p>All that night long Sherry stayed awake, plying the electric
searchlight as the launch patrolled the bank, returning again and
again to the point of most imminent danger, while the leisurely
individual who gave the orders stood by the whistle to sound the
alarm, and the gangs ashore kept toiling under kerosene flares.</p>

<p>"Ef the river don't drop by dawn, she'll open up," was the only
comment the inspector made; but he made it more than once.</p>

<p>However, dawn came, and the levee held. The searchlight paled
and was switched off. Sherry yawned, considering coffee and a
razor. An hour after dawn, the inspector ran the boat's nose
against the bank, threw a line to some one ashore, glanced behind
him casually&mdash;and sprang for the whistle like a fiend let
loose. He gave three long blasts; and as if that were the signal
for the whole world's end, the levee broke at the danger-point
three hundred yards below them. A new brown river burst through to
the bottom-lands. The very river-current changed, and the launch at
full speed forward fought to keep the rope from breaking.</p>

<p>"Drowned the gangs?" asked Sherry.</p>

<p>"Mebbe."</p>

<p>The levee kept going in sections, leaving islands here and there
that cut up the flood into hurrying torrents in which it looked
impossible for anything to live. The inspector cut the bow-rope
with an ax, and after thirty paralyzing seconds at the helm
contrived to work the launch out into the river, where he headed
up-stream and worked slowly around in a semicircle until they were
a hundred yards above the scene of the first break.</p>

<p>"Time to make it's now, I guess," he said quietly, in Sherry's
ear.</p>

<p>"Make what?"</p>

<p>"Pick up a few. There'll be some swimmin'&mdash;an' some not.
You swim, son?"</p>

<p>Sherry nodded.</p>

<p>"Soak her all she has now, Mose!"</p>

<p>It was gorgeous madness, and Sherry laughed aloud. The long lean
inspector at the wheel pulled out a plug of tobacco from his
overalls, bit off a piece, and handed the rest to Sherry.</p>

<p>"Gee, she's openin' up! She'll fill the bottoms most a hundred
mile one way. There'll be funerals. Ain't she got no more'n that,
Mose? Hang on, all!"</p>

<p>The launch plunged like a bit of driftwood but the inspector
kept her headed almost straight for the middle of the broadest gap,
where a torrent a quarter-mile wide now poured with a roar like
Niagara.</p>

<p>"Get y'r boat-hook, son, an' ketch 'em if you see one. You'll
have to make it snappy."</p>

<p>Sherry unfastened the boat-hook from its rack and stood
amidships. But it was impossible to see anything except driftwood
and drowned cattle in that hurrying brown flood. It was fifteen
minutes before they reached water that was slack enough for the
engine to hold its own, and five minutes after that before Sherry
stuck the boat-hook into something black that was jammed in the
fork of a floating tree.</p>

<p>"What ye got, son?"</p>

<p>"Woman, I guess."</p>

<p>"Kickin' too, by the look of her! Lend a hand, Mose!"</p>

<p>She was less than half-drowned, but all-hysterical, and angrier
at the boat-hook than a she-tiger at the cleaner's rake; what with
wet clothes and a basket she still clung to, her weight was
enormous; but they hauled her aboard between them, and set her
gasping against the engine housing.</p>

<p>"Name, please," Sherry asked her, remembering his chosen
profession.</p>

<p>"Consuelo Martinez."</p>

<p>The answer was automatic&mdash;the subconscious functioning of a
mind nearly unhinged by the experience she had come through. Her
first act was equally automatic. She undid the basket and pulled
out an image of the Virgin, beginning to cry as she saw the paint
and gilt had suffered.</p>

<p>"Friends?" asked Sherry, feeling for his pencil and scrap of
paper. "Relatives? Any one with you when you got lost?"</p>

<p>For a second she looked blankly at him, then set the image of
the Virgin down, rose staggering to her feet, and screamed:
"Conchita! Conchita!"</p>

<p>"Who's she?" asked Sherry, while the launch chugged steadily
ahead in search of other victims.</p>

<p>"Conchita! Oh! Oh! Conchita! My baby! Conchita! Conchita!"</p>

<p>She leaned over the side of the launch and screamed at the brown
flood, striking angrily at Sherry when he tried to calm her,
pointing at driftwood &mdash;at dead cattle&mdash;at anything that
moved or showed itself for a second on the water.</p>

<p>"There she is! There she is! Conchita!"</p>

<p>"I'll put her ashore first chance," said the inspector, and
Sherry left off trying to question her. But it made no difference;
she ran from one to the other, striking at them, even wrenching at
the wheel, demanding that they find Conchita, then returning to
lean overside and spread her arms out, crying the same name again
and again until her voice cracked and nothing came forth but a
hoarse whisper. The inspector touched his forehead, and Sherry
nodded.</p>

<p>They pulled out two drowned men after that, and towed a living
horse behind them to a bank, where a raised road checked the flood
and people were already building fires. There were several corpses
laid out in a row, and there were signs that the inevitable
somebody had taken charge and had begun to form the nucleus of a
rescue station.</p>

<p>"You bes' stan' by that woman till she's fixed up," said the
inspector, as they landed the dead freight feet-first. Consuelo was
trying to jump ashore, still screaming, still imagining she saw
Conchita everywhere. Sherry went to help her and she fell on him,
bearing him down head-under into the water at the bank's edge, but
she scrambled out first and up the bank ahead of him, crying to the
groups of men beside the fires and wringing her hands. Sherry took
her basket and went after her, and before he could turn his head
the launch had gone.</p>

<p>Consuelo collapsed at last from lack of breath, and Sherry found
a woman who promised to look after her. With breathlessness came a
trace of returning sanity. She clung to Sherry, begging him to find
Conchita and even trying to describe her:</p>

<p>"Blue eyes&mdash;dark hair&mdash;seventeen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll look for her," said Sherry.</p>

<p>"Promise me!"</p>

<p>When he promised she let go of him&mdash;drove him
away&mdash;screamed at him to make haste, and the last he heard as
he followed the road toward what looked like a village a mile away,
was her cracked, hoarse shriek: "Conchita! Conchita!"</p>

<p>He could not have forgotten the name if he had tried. A few
minutes later he found a man struggling to launch a flat-bottomed
plank boat that had been cast up against the bank with oars still
chained to the rowlocks. He helped him, and volunteered to row with
him in search of victims, so they set off, paddling slowly until
the current swept them around a bend and outward toward the main
stream. Then the other man broke his oar in frenzied efforts to
force the half-filled boat's head shoreward, and one oar was worse
than useless. Sherry sat still.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself!" said the other man suddenly, and jumped for a
tree that rolled and whirled by.</p>

<p>Sherry did suit himself, and sat still in the sinking boat,
while the great tree rolled and bobbed and ducked, and he lost
sight of the man altogether. Then he saw something moving faster
than the water, fifty yards away to his right, toward mid-stream,
and began to kick his boots off. The boat would sink in a minute or
two. He might as well go and lend that strong swimmer
encouragement, if nothing more. So he ran his belt through his coat
sleeves, tied his boots to it by the laces and, towing the coat,
plunged in.</p>

<p>He used the crawl stroke, and he was a strong enough swimmer to
have reached shore by quartering the current, but that obviously
living head being borne along in front of him was a challenge that
stirred his pluck, and he struck out in pursuit. It was about the
time that the current began to get the mastery and to sweep him
farther toward mid-stream that he discovered he was following a
dog.</p>

<p>He drew abreast, and the dog looked at him piteously, beating
the water to raise itself and coughing up a plaintive whine.</p>

<p>"All right, doglums!" he cried out, and swam closer, keeping far
enough away to prevent the dog from pawing him.</p>

<p>A minute or two later he overhauled a section of an old board
fence, and seizing the dog's collar helped him on to it. Swimming
was easier then; he clung to the planks and more or less floated
with the stream, only the fool dog would not keep still, although
he cursed him loud and fervently. At last, barking his mongrel head
off at a barn-roof, the dog tipped the planks too far, lost his
balance, and fell into the water panic-stricken, swimming in rings.
Sherry seized him by the collar, and struck out for the barn-roof;
but he hardly made it; he was more tired than he knew, and the
flood was running with the full weight of the Mississippi heaped
behind it.</p>

<p>But the barn-roof swung, and he caught a corner of it with his
left hand. He had to let go of the dog to do that, and the dog
yelped miserably as the current carried him away. Sherry did not
like half-doing things. Or it was possibly the streak of sentiment,
that gave his father so much uneasiness. He went back for the
dog.</p>

<p>Then the roof swung around again toward him in the vortex of the
flood. He seized the side of it&mdash;threw the dog up high and
dry&mdash;and hauled himself out with his last remaining strength.
After that he did not remember much for a long time, except that he
was sleepy and that the sky turned around and around overhead.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16">CHAPTER 16.</a><br>
Sherry and nuts</h2>

<p class="first">A cold wet nose thrust into her ear awoke
Jacqueline. She tried to brush it away and go on sleeping, for
there was a rather delightful sensation of being rocked gently in a
cradle, although her left hip ached a little where she lay on
something hard. But the wet nose reasserted itself several times,
and she opened her eyes; whereat a mongrel dog promptly began
licking her face, and she was aware of brown water everywhere, and
a blue sky overhead.</p>

<p>The funny part was that she felt&mdash;if not exactly
happy&mdash; confident; perhaps because the dog was friendly; first
impressions when you wake make a world of difference. She sat up,
pulled her shoes off, and poured the lees of water out of them. She
was wet to the skin, but not so very wet; her clothes felt as if
they were drying&mdash;tickled horribly, and she stood up to let
the wind blow through them.</p>

<p>That gave her a view of the whole horizon, for the low-pitched
roof on which she found herself was slowly revolving in mid-stream.
There was a shore on either side, but a long way off, and there
seemed no end to the water in the direction the roof was
taking.</p>

<p>"Consuelo!" she called.</p>

<p>Then she remembered that Consuelo was certainly
drowned&mdash;and felt very sorry for Consuelo, but not for
herself&mdash;and wondered why not. What she did not know was that
she had been crushed to the limit of endurance, that youth was now
asserting its resilience and that there would come a sort of
ground-swell of depression presently. She tried to feel ashamed of
not wanting to cry because Consuelo had gone with every other thing
she ever cared for. But she could neither cry nor feel ashamed.</p>

<p>Then she felt hungry and wondered if the dog was hungry too. The
dog had climbed up to the ridge of the roof and was barking. He
disappeared over the top, was gone a minute and returned to bark at
her again. He was a shaggy affectionate fool of a mongrel dog, of
the sort that you like in spite of him, or because of his comic
lack of anything resembling class. Again he disappeared, and
returned, barking. There was something on the other side of the
roof, she supposed. It might even be Consuelo. Her heart leaped at
that thought. She climbed up on hands and knees to see, tearing her
stocking on a shingle-nail.</p>

<p>She checked a scream, and her blood ran cold as she peered over
the top, for a young man's face looked into hers hardly two feet
away. He, had a crumpled collar&mdash;a two days' growth of dark
whiskers&mdash;and his coat was hanging to his waist from his belt.
He looked as annoyed to see her as she was to discover him; and the
fool dog stood on the ridge between them wriggling with delight and
trying to lick both their faces. Some one had to speak. One says
idiotic things on such occasions.</p>

<p>"I was looking for Consuelo," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you Miss Conchita?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, your mother's all right. I fished her out with a
boat-hook. She's ashore somewhere and being looked after. Better
sit on the ridge, hadn't you? It's easier. Here, use my coat."</p>

<p>He undid his coat from the belt and made a cushion for her on
the ridge.</p>

<p>"There. Sit on that."</p>

<p>It was interesting to be ordered about, and she was too dazed to
resent it. She sat facing one way, and he perched himself on the
ridge about two yards away from her, facing the other way. Then he
called the dog and began petting him.</p>

<p>"Had a long swim, didn't you, doglums!"</p>

<p>She wondered what sort of a person he was. You could not
possibly tell from his clothes, for they were wrinkled and soiled;
and the two days' growth of whiskers made him look rather tough.
But he spoke nicely, although his voice was a shade sullen, and he
was certainly kind to the dog.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" she asked him presently.</p>

<p>"Sit here, I suppose. This roof'll hit something sometime."</p>

<p>"Can't you swim?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I can't leave you here."</p>

<p>She did not feel embarrassed&mdash;and he did, which was funny.
It ought to have been the other way around, for it was the first
time in all her life that she had been alone with a male of
anywhere near her own age. She did not dare to ask about Consuelo,
for fear of being questioned in turn; she had begun to remember
that she mustn't tell any one who she was, and his one idea seemed
to be to avoid saying anything, if possible. She decided she was
not a bit afraid of him, and wondered again and again whether,
after all, it would not be safe to ask about Consuelo, but decided
not to for a while. But she thought he was distinctly rude.</p>

<p>"Is this your roof?" she asked him presently.</p>

<p>"No," he said looking at her sharply.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought perhaps it was."</p>

<p>He laughed at that, and though the tone of it was hardly
courteous his whole face lit up when he smiled, and she decided at
once that she liked him.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," he said. "Haven't I done what I can to make you
comfortable? Would you like my shirt too?"</p>

<p>He looked as if he expected her to say yes, and for the life of
her she did not know why she was not angry with him. But something
rather wistful about his mouth and eyes made her keep on looking at
him when she thought he was not looking at her; and that was quite
easy to do, because he seemed to turn his eyes the other way as
much as possible.</p>

<p>"Have you lost everybody, too?" she asked at last.</p>

<p>"No," he said curtly, then glanced at her sharply again.</p>

<p>"I told you your mother's safe. She's dry by now."</p>

<p>It was on the tip of her tongue to say that Consuelo was not her
relative, but she suddenly remembered the shrieking headlines of
the newspaper, and in a panic she decided to say nothing. He played
with the dog until the dog crawled on to his lap, curled up and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>"What is the dog's name?" she asked at last, feeling that was
surely a safe subject.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Isn't he your dog?"</p>

<p>"From now on yes, probably. I fished him out of the water."</p>

<p>"Oh, then let's give him a name!"</p>

<p>"Not 'Buster'!" he said instantly. "Every dam-dog anybody finds
gets called that."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Mansfield&mdash;Sherry Mansfield. San Francisco's my home.
Sorry&mdash;I ought to have mentioned it."</p>

<p>"Sherry? That's rather nice. Nuts go with sherry, don't they?
Call him 'Nut.'"</p>

<p>He nodded, reappraising her. "His name is Nut from now on," he
answered. "What's yours? I've told mine."</p>

<p>He looked straight at her and she shrank back with reawakened
panic &mdash;fearing above all that he might see that she was
afraid. So that little frown that always mocked her real emotion
began dancing above the blue eyes, and he thought she was puzzled
by his own stupidity.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," he said, "I remember. Conchita&mdash;let's see,
what was your mother's name&mdash;Martinez&mdash;Conchita Martinez
then. Spanish, eh?"</p>

<p>"Spanish ancestry," she answered, wondering at her own
readiness, and thankful she had not told a downright lie. The
Lanier blood is mixed of French and Spanish and New England.</p>

<p>"Your mother looked more like a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a Dago?" she suggested, looking mischievous. Anything to
keep him going!</p>

<p>"More like a Spaniard than you do," he said, laughing. "My own
folks come from England, but we're mixed up like all the rest. I'd
a hot tamale grandmother&mdash;never saw the lady, but they say she
turned my granddad's head over the top of a fan in Mexico City, and
killed him finally."</p>

<p>"Oh! How old was he when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When he checked out? Ninety. They say he died all tired
out."</p>

<p>He was perfectly serious. Her little answering bubble of
laughter puzzled him, and that made her laugh all the more, until
it got beyond control, and the dog woke up and wagged his tail, and
barked in sympathy. So Sherry Mansfield had to laugh too. She did
not sound hysterical, although she felt so.</p>

<p>"Hey! We're going to miss it!" he said suddenly, and jumped up.
"Give me your hand&mdash;quick! Bring my coat! Where are your
shoes?"</p>

<p>"I've got them."</p>

<p>"Come on now&mdash;and jump when I tell you!"</p>

<p>She could jump and she did not need assistance. But she liked
the way he told her to carry his coat, and she liked the way he
thought about her shoes; so she let him hold her hand, and ran down
the roof beside him. They had drifted close to a barn that stood
hay-loft-high out of the water, and the roof they were on was
slowly swinging so that a corner of it would miss the barn by not
much.</p>

<p>"Now never mind if you fall in&mdash;I'll look after you. Come
here, Nut!"</p>

<p>He picked up the dog and seized Jacqueline unceremoniously by
the wrist.</p>

<p>"Now!"</p>

<p>They jumped in together through a hay-loft door, the dog
struggled free from Sherry's arms to go careering about, barking at
imaginary rats and what not. At one end there was a sort of cubicle
without a door, and the rest of the space was a kind of general
storehouse, in which all sorts of odds and ends looked as if they
had been accumulating for a generation. There was very little hay.
The cubicle faced a stair-head and Sherry went at once with a
businesslike air to see where the stairs might lead to. He turned
back looking glum.</p>

<p>"The second step down's under water," he said. "We're still
marooned."</p>

<p>Jacqueline shrugged her shoulders, which seemed to surprise him.
He returned to the open door and swung himself outward to look for
a means of escape; but there was nothing in view except water, and
beyond that miles of mud. Suddenly the dog began barking furiously
in a corner where the hay was heaped, and Jacqueline ran to see
what the matter might be.</p>

<p>"Quickly-call him off!" she cried out.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Cat&mdash;and bits of baby kittens!"</p>

<p>Sherry came over and watched the engagement. Nut knew better
than to go too near. The cat and five kittens had their backs up
against the hay. Nut was satisfied to annoy them from outside
scratching-range.</p>

<p>"Call Nut off!" Jacqueline insisted, down on her knees, trying
to soothe the cat's fears.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry if I were you," Sherry answered rudely.</p>

<p>Jacqueline heaped the kittens into her lap and drove Nut away
with a broken piece of wood, the first thing handy.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, looking up at Sherry with puzzled
frown, that he thought mocked him.</p>

<p>"I mean she's not a woman, she'll look after her own young," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Will you keep the dog away?" she demanded.</p>

<p>She felt her own temper rising. Something in his manner, rather
than his words, had stung like a rebuke, and she was not in the
least accustomed to being rebuked by strangers.</p>

<p>Not answering, he found a piece of twine and tied Nut to one of
the cubicle stanchions. Then he began whistling as if he had
forgotten the incident altogether and started to explore the
cubicle.</p>

<p>"Oh, good!" he called out. "Eats! Lots of 'em! These coons seem
to cache stuff just like magpies! Nearly a whole case of canned
soup&mdash;peanuts &mdash;stale
bread&mdash;soap&mdash;shaving-brush&mdash;oh, hell! Just my luck:
It's an old-fashioned one."</p>

<p>"Old-fashioned what?"</p>

<p>"Razor. I use a safety. And there's no mirror. Damn!"</p>

<p>"It looks like a coon's shaving brush!" she said, coming to peer
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I don't care if a dozen coons have used it. I'm going to shave!
Maybe you'd like to eat, though. I'll open a can of soup."</p>

<p>"No, you may shave first. Perhaps you'll talk more nicely when
you look clean."</p>

<p>He flashed another of his sudden, searching glances at her.</p>

<p>"Have I been rude?" he said. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>But again, in a moment, he seemed to dismiss the thought from
mind. Next minute he was whistling again, and trying to sharpen the
razor on an old piece of leather harness.</p>

<p>"Care if I do this in this light?" he asked. "If I bleed much
you can look the other way."</p>

<p>He smiled as he said that, and she knew intuitively that however
he might talk, he was no savage. She guessed he would not willingly
hurt anything or any one&mdash;unless perhaps himself.</p>

<p>"You might wait behind the partition," he suggested.</p>

<p>But the cubicle was dark and rather smelly. She preferred to
watch him, and sat down in the hay beside cat the and kittens. She
had seen men being shaved through barber-shop windows on her rare
visits to New Orleans, and had watched the Negroes shaving one
another in the lane outside the shacks on Don Andres' estate; it
had always struck her as a comical performance, but reaction from
the terror she had passed through made this one seem utterly
ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Let me help," she suggested, giggling.</p>

<p>"Wish you'd find a mirror!" he answered testily.</p>

<p>He lay on his stomach and leaned as far as he dared out through
the barn door, trying to see his reflection in the muddy water. But
that was no good; he could not even use his arms in that position,
and he was getting angrier every minute. Jacqueline, sputtering
with laughter, went and hunted in the cubicle, but the nearest
thing she could find to a mirror was a soup-can. She held that, end
toward him; but the tin was too dull, and she could not hold it
nearly still enough because of suppressed giggles.</p>

<p>"Damn!" he exploded at last. "I wish I hadn't begun this."</p>

<p>"Shall I try to finish it?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes! You can't do worse than I've done!"</p>

<p>She had not expected him to answer yes, and she would have given
a million dollars that minute, if she had them, to take her words
back. But he pulled out a box, and sat on it with his face to the
light in such a matter-of- fact, determined way that she did not
see how to refuse. She wondered what Consuelo would think about it,
if she knew, and that made her smile.</p>

<p>"Dip your brush in the water at the foot of the stairs and put
more soap on first," he said. "Then scrape the soap off with the
edge of the razor. Never mind if I swear&mdash;I don't mean
anything."</p>

<p>She had never been spoken to exactly like that before in all her
life. There was not a trace of flattery or of anything false or
assumed in his manner. He addressed her as an equal, except that he
gave her orders; and he even gave orders as if it were the most
natural thing in the world, with no possibility of his attitude
being misunderstood. She could imagine him taking orders from some
one else in the same way.</p>

<p>It was the strangest experience she had ever had, but she left
off laughing, for in a convent they do not teach you how to shave
men and she was mortally afraid of cutting him. She remembered
having seen old-fashioned prints in which the barber held his
victim by the nose (presumably to keep his head from waggling) and
she wondered whether he would be able to breathe if she did
that.</p>

<p>"Carve away!" he urged.</p>

<p>So she tried holding his nose, and he laughed so that she nearly
dropped the razor.</p>

<p>"If I'm not to hold your nose, how are you to keep your head
still?" she asked after one or two dangerous experiments. "Oh,
look! I've got some hair off already!"</p>

<p>She showed him the hairs on the razor-edge. "But you'll have to
hold still, you know."</p>

<p>He tried leaning back with his head against the side of the
barn, but she could not get at him that way. He tried' standing up,
but that was worse. Finally he sat down on the box again, and
leaned against her, letting his head fall back against her
shoulder, she steadying herself with one knee on the box behind
him. Which was a rather intimate arrangement, but it worked. She
made a few small cuts on his cheek but shaved him clean, and
laughed triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged," he said, and went to wash the soap and blood
off at the stairway. Jacqueline watched him with her frown going
sixteen to the dozen. Some how he might have said more than that.
He might have looked back at her and smiled. And yet&mdash;he did
not give her the impression now of being rude exactly. All of the
men she had known hitherto would have spent the time loading her
with compliments, and yet not one of them would have inspired her
with the confidence that this blunt individual did. She would have
felt afraid to be alone with any of the others. She did not feel
alone with this man&mdash;did not need the least protection from
him&mdash;knew she could trust him absolutely.</p>

<p>Then came one of those strange freaks of memory, that persist in
the most unlikely places, apropos of nothing. Sister Michaela's
gray eyes, and sober face, and quiet voice</p>

<p>"Trust your intuition, Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>And she in a barn&mdash;with a man&mdash;with the floods all
around, and no relief in sight&mdash;and a soapy razor in her hand!
She looked at the razor wondering. What had Desmio meant when he
said the world was dangerous? It did not seem to be!</p>

<p>Sherry Mansfield broke into her reverie by bringing out three
cans of soup and opening them with a broken axe. There were no
plates or spoons. They had to dip stale bread into the stuff, and
use fingers, and laugh, and act like savages, feeding Nut and the
cat between-times, and discovering that Nut could do tricks. Then
peanuts for dessert, and soup brown water to drink that Sherry
dipped up in one of the empty cans and swore was better than the
coffee they gave him in France. She hoped Consuelo was having real
bread and hot coffee. She felt she had known Sherry a hundred years
when the meal was over, and, girl-like, wondered whether he might
be the individual who got the socks she knitted during the war. She
even asked him whether he thought it possible.</p>

<p>"Dunno," he answered. "I know I got some awful misfits."</p>

<p>Not a shadow of a smile. He was stating a fact simply.</p>

<p>"Have you a mother?" she asked him suddenly. It was the subject
of socks that connected up the train of thought. She was thinking
wildly of anything that would keep the past out of her mind and was
only putting the first question that occurred to her as she sat
watching him from the other end of the hay bale. He looked as if he
had a mother.</p>

<p>But the very mention of the word brought a frown to his face. He
got up without answering her, and went to rummage in the cubicle,
turning things over and taking a long time about it. He seemed to
spend as much time in there as he could find excuse for,
rearranging everything, and setting the cans of soup in a row along
the wall. When he came out at last his manner was distant. He said
nothing, but went and stood in the doorway with his hands in his
pockets, staring out at the flood.</p>

<p>She felt sorry for him and wondered why. He was rude, and she
should have been angry. But his face, as he watched the water, had
resumed that wistful expression she had noticed when they first
met, and the effect it had on her was to make her feel he needed
sympathy.</p>

<p>She found him so intensely interesting that he helped her to
forget her own predicament, and only wondered how she could find
out what the matter was with him without offending him once more.
It hurt her to offend him as much as it seemed to hurt him. For all
his bluntness he seemed astonishingly sensitive&mdash;in fact he
seemed to try to cover it up with bluntness.</p>

<p>Sherry Mansfield watched the frown over her eyes with deep,
almost embarrassing interest.</p>

<p>"What puzzles you?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"You, Mr. Mansfield!"</p>

<p>"I don't feel like a mystery. What's the conundrum?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering&mdash;don't be angry, please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on. Ask anything. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;I promise not to tell, but&mdash;that
is&mdash;have you, done anything bad? Are you dangerous? I don't
mean that, I mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>His roars of laughter stopped her&mdash;huge, amused, immense
laughter, followed by a look of pity that cut her to the bone,
although he meant it kindly and she knew it. He got up, looked
about him, and brought her the razor, holding it out on the palm of
his hand.</p>

<p>"Take this and keep it by you to protect yourself!" he said,
grinning.</p>

<p>She took the thing and flung it through the open door into the
flood. She rose and tried to glare at him. But the glare would not
work; the frown danced funnily above the blue eyes and brought an
answering smile from him.</p>

<p>"Now you can't shave me any more!" he said.</p>

<p>"At least you know I'm not afraid of you!" she retorted; but she
could not make it sound brave, for her voice was choking.</p>

<p>"If I thought you were afraid of me I'd swim off and leave you,"
he answered, puzzled.</p>

<p>She was panic-stricken instantly. She would kill herself if left
alone with her own thoughts. She sat down on the hay and started
crying, hating herself, yet crying more the more she struggled not
to. She felt suddenly alone, and sick at heart&mdash;aching,
yearning to be comforted. She longed for Consuelo. The dog came and
pushed his nose between her hands. She hugged him to herself,
squeezing him so tightly that he whimpered. She wished this man
would go away leave her&mdash;swim off as he had threatened to. But
he kept on standing near her, not touching her or saying anything,
but just standing still. Perhaps he was waiting for his dog. She
let the dog go.</p>

<p>"Say: please tell me what it's all about," Sherry asked at last,
in a different tone of voice to any he had used yet. She shook her
head violently, her face between her hands, wishing he would not
stand there.</p>

<p>"Is it me? Have I done anything?"</p>

<p>His appeal was simply pitiful; she could not endure it. She left
off crying as suddenly as she had begun, and sat up, staring at him
through the tears.</p>

<p>"Why did you laugh at me?" she asked. "You looked sad and I was
sorry for you. Weren't you cruel to laugh?"</p>

<p>He looked utterly incapable of cruelty; that truth forced itself
on her as he stood dumbly wondering what to say. He looked like a
big bewildered boy with his eyes full of tenderness.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you felt sorry for me," he said, as if he were
groping for the reason. "I know I feel mighty sorry if I've made
you feel badly. I don't know what I did. Won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>Neither did she know what he did, now that he asked her! She
only did know that she felt compassion for him&mdash;that his
tenderness and his wistfulness, so utterly different from the other
brusk manner, were due to some great grief inside him. Her heart
told her that.</p>

<p>He sat down on the other end of the hay-bale, waiting for her to
tell him wherein he had wronged her, as puzzled as she was, only
much more master of himself.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to tell me," he said quietly.</p>

<p>There was nothing to tell! She watched him for a full long
minute, he keeping his eyes averted in order not to increase her
embarrassment. She began to feel not embarrassed, and to know that
he was to understand that she had injured him, not he her.</p>

<p>"What did you mean&mdash;?" she asked suddenly; then stopped. It
was none of her business after all. He was a stranger. He had
respected her privilege &mdash;had asked her nothing that she might
not care to answer.</p>

<p>"Ask anything you like," he said quietly, still looking straight
in front of him. "I'll answer if I can."</p>

<p>"What did you mean by saying what you did about the cat and her
kittens?"</p>

<p>His eyes looked swiftly, straightly into hers. They were
challenging &mdash;on guard instantly. Her frown was working
busily, but it had begun to dawn on him that it might not mean
mockery, else why the tears? The blue eyes underneath were brimming
with honesty. Wondering, she watched the change of his expression,
as he deliberately lowered his guard. He had made up his mind to
trust her&mdash;she knew it&mdash;thrilled.</p>

<p>"I'd bore you if I told you that."</p>

<p>"No you wouldn't!" she answered, pleading with him and when
Jacqueline was in that mood none less adamant than Donna Isabella
could resist.</p>

<p>"You recall you asked me if I have a mother?"</p>

<p>She nodded. The dog came and fussed with her. She laid a hand on
him to keep him still.</p>

<p>"Well, I have&mdash;or I had&mdash;I don't know which to call
it." He was looking away again and his lips were set as if he hated
to tell what was coming.</p>

<p>"I knew my mother until I was nine years old. She meant a lot to
me. I loved her. So did dad. She left him&mdash;quit him and me. He
divorced her. Now you know."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but why did she go away?"</p>

<p>"God knows. Dad says because she was a woman! She broke his
heart all right, and he's a man, mind you."</p>

<p>"Because she was a woman?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Woman are the only creatures, except fish and alligators,
that desert their young! That cat wouldn't. She'd fight
all-comers."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;so you hate all women?"</p>

<p>"No. I'd find it easy if I did. But I've seen what happened to
dad. And if she&mdash;my mother&mdash;acted that way, where are you
going to draw the line?"</p>

<p>"You hate your mother?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Jacqueline let out a huge sigh of relief, that made him look at
her again. The frown was busy but he could not doubt her eyes. He
was conscious that he had not half-explained himself and went on,
forcing out the words, but looking straight at her now.</p>

<p>"You see&mdash;when you love anybody that
much&mdash;and&mdash;she deserts you&mdash;you don't care to talk
about it, but you can't grin even when you think about it. Get me?"
he ended savagely.</p>

<p>"Are you sure she&mdash;deserted you, as you call it?"</p>

<p>"She went away. She left us flat&mdash;and not a word of
explanation."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was something she couldn't explain."</p>

<p>Sherry stared at her. There was a choke in Jacqueline's voice as
she went on:</p>

<p>"It has happened to women that they were forced into a position,
in which no explanation was possible or would do any
good&mdash;because they wouldn't be believed. So they just ran
away, and said nothing&mdash;and tried to forget."</p>

<p>"She forgot me all right!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure!"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten her?"</p>

<p>"You see I haven't."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know she's forgotten you, Mr. Mansfield?"</p>

<p>He got up and began to walk about the floor, with his head down
and his hands behind him.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that," he said, flashing another of his
swift penetrating glances at her.</p>

<p>"I feel quite sure your mother's a darling," she said with the
all- challenging conviction of innocence and seventeen.</p>

<p>He stopped and stood in front of her again.</p>

<p>"All I know is, she made dad bitter&mdash;and he's made me
bitter &mdash;and it stays put. He did it thoroughly. Most women
don't make any difference. But I can't talk to a woman I like real
well, without the image of my mother cropping up, and coming in
between. There's nothing to it after that. I quit."</p>

<p>He went to the door&mdash;sat down with his back against the
frame &mdash;found a can of damp tobacco and his pipe&mdash;and,
smoked in silence, staring out at the flood.</p>

<p>"Some one'll come sometime," he said at the end of ten
minutes.</p>

<p>Then, at the end of twenty minutes more:</p>

<p>"Tell me when you want something to eat."</p>

<p>Half an hour after that he again found his tongue:</p>

<p>"I'll fix you a soft place in the hay whenever you feel like
lying down. Say: look at that cat and dog!"</p>

<p>Cat, dog and kittens were all coiled up in a lump together, fast
asleep.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17">CHAPTER 17.</a><br>
"Who'd believe a word of it?"</h2>

<p class="first">Perhaps it was the dog and cats. Force of example
is enormous. There was Brace and the spider, for instance. We are
as easily moved by trifles into courses as a horse is by heel and
rein.</p>

<p>It grew dark, and Sherry Mansfield opened more soup, arguing
that they must eat while they could see to do it. Then he found a
pitchfork, broke up the bale of hay, and arranged a comfortable bed
for Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to sleep?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere. I'll be all right."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to take all the hay and leave you uncomfortable,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"I'll have to watch for rescue-parties. They'll be coming with
searchlights before long."</p>

<p>"I'll sit up, too." She did not dare to lie down in darkness,
for fear of the thoughts that might overtake her.</p>

<p>"I won't let you sit up."</p>

<p>She went over to the door and stood there watching the first
pale stars appear. Sherry went on forking hay, piling it into a
heap against the wall and spreading it. "There," he said at last,
"it's all ready."</p>

<p>"I told you, I don't want to."</p>

<p>He came over and stood beside her in the doorway, leaning on the
pitchfork, smiling.</p>

<p>"I say, don't let's quarrel."</p>

<p>She could not help smiling when he did.</p>

<p>"Make a bed for yourself," she answered.</p>

<p>"There isn't enough hay for two. We'd both be cold and
comfortless instead of one of us. What's the use? You're the
woman."</p>

<p>"That's not my fault, Mr. Mansfield."</p>

<p>"But you are."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly she was. She sat down in the doorway with her back
against the frame and hands crossed over her knees.</p>

<p>"Look. The moon's rising," she answered. The moonlight was wan
and lonely- looking but better than the darkness.</p>

<p>Sherry was totally uninterested in the moon. He walked back to
the hay and prodded it in the dark. The dog yelped.</p>

<p>"Damn!" he grumbled. "The whole menagerie has gone and camped on
your bed. Can you beat that? She's toted all her kittens up
here!"</p>

<p>"Did you hurt Nut?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, nothing serious&mdash;just struck him sidewise with a
prong. Get off that hay, you rascal!"</p>

<p>"No, let them all stay there. I'm not going to use it."</p>

<p>He walked back to the doorway, and sat down facing her.</p>

<p>"Now listen, Miss Martinez, won't you be reasonable?" he began.
He could see her face quite clearly in the moonlight now, and she
could see his. He looked delightfully worried, and that was
satisfying, though she did not know why. Reason did not enter into
it.</p>

<p>"Why don't you lie down?" she suggested. "I'm not tired
yet."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. He found his pipe and began smoking.</p>

<p>"I believe you are afraid of me," he said after a while.</p>

<p>Jacqueline was looking at the moonlight on the water, but she
knew he had not once taken his eyes off her face.</p>

<p>"Not one little, tiny bit!" she answered, still not looking at
him.</p>

<p>"You're quite right, of course&mdash;and yet&mdash;I
suppose&mdash; somehow, you ought to be," he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, meeting his eyes at last. She was not afraid
of him, she would be terrified if he should go away and leave her.
The frown began working overtime.</p>

<p>He did not answer, and there was another long silence, broken
only by the lapping of water, and a rustling as the dog settled
down more snugly into the hay.</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I see any sense in this!" he said, looking at her
suddenly. "The dog and the cats are the only ones who are
scoring!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to sit here just as long as you do!" she
answered.</p>

<p>Jacqueline did not know just why she said that, except that it
was interesting to oppose him and see him frown. She wondered at
herself. She knew that if she could only contrive to let Consuelo
know she was all right she would not feel downhearted in the
least&mdash;only frightened of her own thoughts. She began to hope
there was only an allowance of so much misery to each individual,
and she had used all hers.</p>

<p>"Why should you worry about me?" she asked him. He flashed
another of his sharp glances at her.</p>

<p>"Don't you women like us to worry about you?"</p>

<p>She had not grown used yet to being spoken of as a woman. But
she confessed to herself that she felt like one; she had left the
convent days, years behind, although only the day before
yesterday&mdash;</p>

<p>She checked that thought. It hurt. She did not dare to look
backward.</p>

<p>"Do you worry about your mother?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Always. I can't talk to dad about her, for he simply blows up.
But I'm always wondering where she is, and what she's
doing&mdash;and whether she'd laugh if she knew I
worried&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know she wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"How do you know? According to dad, you women are all alike, and
you like nothing better than to have a man eating his heart out. He
says the best of you are like that secretly, only some of you can
keep up the pretense longer than others."</p>

<p>"Do you believe him, Mr. Mansfield?" she asked; if he could have
seen her frown he might have thought his father was quite right
after all. But all he could see was her eyes. They were
hurt&mdash;wondering.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he answered. "Dad's dead wise about most
things."</p>

<p>"I think you're both horrid!" she exploded.</p>

<p>She got up, and walked over to the hay, where she lay down
presently between the animals and the wall, grateful for the cat's
luxurious purring because it made her feel less lonely, and
watching Sherry's silhouette against the stars in the doorway. She
did not think he was horrid, but it made her angry that he should
deceive himself with such thoughts. And then she began to worry
because she knew that Consuelo would be worrying. Poor Consuelo
would think she was drowned and would be crying.</p>

<p>Sherry sat frowning for a long while in the doorway, and at last
relit his pipe. He supposed she was right; he was horrid&mdash;felt
so, anyway. Well, he couldn't help that. Dad had lectured him, and
shown him God knew how many hundred examples in print, and had told
him he must cut women out of his life until he was at least
thirty&mdash;had even made that condition of advancement on the
Tribune. He supposed a fellow must pay a price for everything, and
it was best, no doubt, that this girl should think him a monster.
He only wished he thought the same of her! He did not&mdash;damn
it!</p>

<p>He was a fool not to swim away and leave her. Should he do that?
Absolutely no! There was not one hint of a doubt in his mind on
that score! He had never seen anything in all his life half so
beautiful&mdash;and her eyes were incredible&mdash;haunted
him&mdash;they seemed to hold torture hidden in their blue
depths.</p>

<p>Bah! They were just eyes. One pair of eyes is the same as
another, and the whole world is full of them! But what a strange
thing that hers should be that fathomless blue when her mother's,
he remembered, were brown and quite ordinary. She did not resemble
her mother in any way in fact. This girl, even in crumpled dress
and disordered hair, seemed to have breeding in every inch of her;
and she spoke deliciously&mdash;no other word for it&mdash;
deliciously.</p>

<p>Damn! He would think about somebody else. For instance, Wahl. He
wondered what Wahl was doing. Had the Limited got through? Or had
the track been washed away, and was Wahl back again covering the
flood-stuff after all? It made him smile to think of Wahl doing the
story he despised so heartily.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;he heard her crying. It was unlike the outburst of
the afternoon that had held the reaction of hysteria. It was
stealthy&mdash;as if she were afraid he would hear&mdash;and
pitiful and forlorn, broken now and then by sobs that brought back
memories of a big room&mdash;solitude &mdash;and a child sobbing
for his mother.</p>

<p>He crossed to her, cursing himself for a thoughtless brute, and
knelt beside her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say&mdash;Miss Martinez&mdash;don't cry. Are you worried
about your mother?"</p>

<p>The crying stopped. Jacqueline became still&mdash;he could sense
the effort for control.</p>

<p>"Have I been rude again?" She shook her head. "I'm sorry. Would
you like me to talk to you? Would that help any?"</p>

<p>A hand, tear-wet from being beneath her cheek, touched his.
"Nobody can help me, Mr. Mansfield, and please don't worry. You
must be tired. There's lots of room for you on the outside of the
hay."</p>

<p>He was dumb for nearly half a minute. Was his father right? Or
was he right? He was willing to bet she was as innocent as her
voice sounded. And he knew his own attitude. But would he be doing
the right thing to accept the invitation? Suppose some one came and
found them? Suppose Wahl found them!</p>

<p>"I can't see you in the dark," he said at last. "I might crowd
you or roll over on the cats or something."</p>

<p>"Be careful then!" she answered.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;that was a sensible answer. Maybe the most sensible
thing to do was to take her at her word and lie down. He crawled on
to the outside edge of the pile, and after he had done pulling hay
out of his ears and neck, lay for a long time listening to her
breathing, and to the occasional rustling of the menagerie that lay
between them, and then at last his own weariness overcame him and
he fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was just beginning to be daylight. He felt
something on his shoulder that touched his chin, and thought for a
second it must be the dog who had wearied of the cats' company. He
was going to shake it off, when it occurred to him it could not be
the dog&mdash;not heavy enough&mdash;not hairy. Hardly moving his
head, he managed to look slantwise along his face. Jacqueline's
fingers were touching his chin. Her arm was on his shoulder.</p>

<p>He lay still and considered that for a few minutes&mdash;liked
it decidedly, but wondered what to do. At last he turned over,
inches at a time. She was lying face toward him, fast asleep, with
a great lock of dark hair falling loose over her shoulder, and her
head pillowed on his folded jacket. She looked as if she had been
crying again, but that, he figured, was impossible&mdash;he would
have heard her. The cats and dog were equally fast asleep in a
glomeration near her knees. He managed to roll clear without waking
her, and spent five minutes in mid-floor studying the
situation.</p>

<p>"Who'd believe a word of it?" he asked himself. "Not Wahl, at
any rate!"</p>

<p>"That girl's good!" he muttered. "She's O.K. I wish I knew
what's wrong!"</p>

<p>Then Nut woke up and yawned, and the cat followed suit; but
Jacqueline went on sleeping. Sherry went to the door and stared out
at the flood, but there was no relief in sight.</p>

<p>He tried to see around the barn, but failed, so stripped off
everything except his underclothing and plunged in, Nut following.
But although he swam around the barn he did not learn much, except
that the flood-water was wider than he thought. They seemed to be
about two miles away from the nearest shore.</p>

<p>Even Nut, barking and shaking himself, did not wake Jacqueline.
That did not happen until the kittens started climbing all over her
and she sat up, slipping them. But she buried her face in the
folded coat again, at once. Sleep&mdash;why couldn't she sleep
forever? She felt she could not bear the load of returning
consciousness. Memory made her brain ache and her heart numb. It
was long, long minutes before she recalled who Sherry was, and that
he had been kind to her the day before. She wished though, that he
would not stand there looking at her.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish we had some coffee?" asked Sherry.</p>

<p>He felt overwhelmingly sentimental all at once, and extravagant.
He would like to give that girl not only coffee but coffee in a
Dresden china cup, served on snow-white napery amid luxurious
surroundings. She ought to be wearing wonderful clothes, and to
have servants waiting on her. She ought to have everything her
heart desired.</p>

<p>After breakfast he found some old nails, and with the aid of
broken bits of wood contrived steps by which to climb on to the
roof. She insisted on climbing up after him, and he was surprised
by the thrill it gave him to put his arms under hers and lift her
bodily up the last stage of the climb. He had danced with scores of
girls, and lifted lots of them over awkward places; most of them
had annoyed him&mdash;one, he recalled&mdash;had kissed him; and
nine out of ten had expected to be kissed, or at least flirted
with. He had never experienced this thrill before, or the feeling
that he held something precious in his arms. It made him
speechless.</p>

<p>They sat together on the roof, until the sun got too hot,
watching for rescuers; but none came within hail, although they saw
boats moving in the distance. There was no doubt they would be
rescued before long, and he wondered vaguely why he did not welcome
the thought. Several times, when he turned to look at her, he
discovered she was looking at him, which embarrassed both of them,
and they both pretended at once that they were looking at something
else.</p>

<p>"You'll get sunstroke if you sit here any longer," he said at
last. "I'll help you down."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I'm used to the sun."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You've no hat. Give me your hand, and I'll lower you
to the top step. Both hands!"</p>

<p>He was as masterful as if he owned her, and as considerate as if
she owned him! He had to kneel, and her laughing blue eyes came
close to his. He could have kissed her easily&mdash;would have
loved to&mdash;she was adorable as she smiled up at him with parted
lips. And he knew he would no more kiss her than let her fall.</p>

<p>When he reached the hay-loft he sat down in the doorway and
began smoking &mdash;not that he wanted to smoke, or that tobacco
tasted good, but because he felt the need of mastering himself and
of studying the situation.</p>

<p>Damn! He would see straight or bu'st! Here was a
girl&mdash;Gosh, what a girl! Prettier than blazes&mdash;breeding
in every inch of her&mdash;and plucky&mdash;There he was again,
looking at only one side of it!</p>

<p>Spike that&mdash;admit it if you like&mdash;who is she? How much
did he know about her? Nothing! Funny old fat mother with hysterics
and elastic- sided boots and cotton stockings. He smiled as he
remembered the fat legs.</p>

<p>"What are you smiling at?" she asked.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the hay-pile, fooling with the kittens and
keeping the jealous Nut away from them with one hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, was I smiling? Some darned thought&mdash;I forget now what
it was!"</p>

<p>Suppose he should come right out and ask her who she was? Why
not? The question would be civil. He was quite willing to tell her
who he was. Would it be fair? Perfectly. But would it? And how
about her? She knew nothing whatever about him&mdash;except that he
made some beastly rude remarks to her about women in general. She
was all alone; and she was trusting him implicitly had paid him the
compliment of never once doubting him. The white thing to do was to
wait until he found her friends, and had backing, and could use
unembarrassed judgment. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" she exclaimed suddenly. "I've found something for
you to read! It must have fallen out of your coat pocket."</p>

<p>She held up a folded newspaper, torn and pulpy-looking from
having been soaked through&mdash;then suddenly threw it away from
her, biting her lip. She wished she had bitten her tongue off
before she spoke. A newspaper meant only one thing to
her&mdash;Wahl and his story!</p>

<p>"Let's look through the advertisements!" said Sherry. He picked
the paper up and sat beside her.</p>

<p>Jacqueline steeled herself and set her teeth. Sherry unfolded
the paper, back page first, but it was not very legible; the ink
was rubbed off where the folds had been. There was a column of
"swaps" that made humorous reading, and he laughed over that for a
while, rather wondering why she did not laugh too. Then he turned
to the front page, and remembered why Wahl had given him the
paper.</p>

<p>There was a triangular tear extending one-third down the page,
and one illustration was missing; but Wahl's face was there sure
enough&mdash;"our special correspondent"&mdash;grinning in his
"box" on top of column one, and most of the headlines were intact.
It was the story of Jacqueline Lanier, and Sherry in front of
Jacqueline&mdash;she looking over his shoulder, with her hair three
inches from his face&mdash;began reading it aloud.</p>

<p>It was a full minute before it dawned on him that something was
the matter. He glanced over his shoulder. Jacqueline was not
reading the paper; she was staring at it. Her hands were trembling.
Her face was horror-stricken, and deathly white.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" he asked her. He was afraid she was going to
faint.</p>

<p>She did not answer. Instead, she snatched the paper, tore it
down the middle, crumpled it in both hands, and threw it to the
floor, where Nut promptly pounced on it and finished the
destruction, ripping it into a thousand pieces. Sherry decided she
was not going to faint; her eyes were blazing with indignation, and
she watched Nut tearing up the paper as if that gave her
comfort.</p>

<p>"Do tell me what's wrong," he begged her.</p>

<p>She made no answer, and the indignation in her eyes seemed to
melt into something else that he could not quite place; but it was
tragic&mdash;he was sure of that.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Was it the paper?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He saw tears brimming very near the surface, and knew she was
fighting gamely to keep them back. He admired that. He found it
hard to take his eyes off her, she looked so tragically unhappy,
and brave, and more beautiful than anything he remembered to have
seen. But it was only decent to turn his back, to give her a
chance, he occupied himself with picking up the scraps of newspaper
and throwing them out into the flood.</p>

<p>"Damn that man Wahl! He's a jinx!" he muttered. When he turned
at last to look she was still sitting on the hay-pile, staring
straight in front of her, but her expression had changed. She
looked as if everything she ever loved was lost; he never saw such
grief, or such a proud, brave air of hopelessness.</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "you stirred my memories yesterday, and did me
lots of good by talking to me about them. If you'd like to tell me
yours, maybe I can help you."</p>

<p>Her eyes seemed to be searching his desperately. She was hanging
on to something&mdash;hanging on like grim death.</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;did you read that paper?" she asked him
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;didn't have time to."</p>

<p>He was going to say something else, but checked himself. The
look of relief that suddenly crossed her face was just as if acute
physical torture had come to an end.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you didn't."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It was cruel. I think it was as cruel as what happened to your
mother."</p>

<p>"I don't quite get you. My mother simply left us&mdash;went away
without a word of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you I know she ran away because she simply had to! There
was no other way out. She had reached a place where she couldn't
endure life another minute, and she
ran&mdash;ran&mdash;ran&mdash;hoping nobody would ever find or
recognize her. And you all said she was a criminal. And then she
read the papers, I suppose, and&mdash;and of course she couldn't
ever come back."</p>

<p>"But how are the cases similar? That was the story of a girl
named Lanier, wasn't it? Wahl asked me to interview her&mdash;said
she was a scheming little vamp, who&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself again. There was fear now, as well as anger
in her face. He had said something that hurt her terribly, he was
sure of that.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who did you say asked you to interview her?"</p>

<p>"Clinton Wahl. He's a reporter&mdash;special
correspondent&mdash;just joined the Tribune. My dad owns the San
Francisco Tribune. Why&mdash;why &mdash;what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Mr. Mansfield!"</p>

<p>She got up and left him&mdash;walked over to the hay-loft door.
For a moment he thought she was going to throw herself into the
water, and every muscle in his body tightened to spring after
her.</p>

<p>But Jacqueline did not do that because she knew very well he
would jump after her. She had nothing left but pride. The world was
gone again. She did not propose to be fished back and made to face
her agony. Her heart was numb, and her head was dizzy with that
last blow. But she would face it. The world might beat her down;
but she would face it. Desmio would have done that.</p>

<p>She would turn and face this gentleman&mdash;this kind and most
considerate gentleman&mdash;this friend of the devil's
own&mdash;and not let him know she was stung in the
heart&mdash;sick, lonely, and afraid.</p>

<p>She did turn, standing bravely upright, just fingering the
locket with Desmio's picture in it, because that seemed to give her
courage.</p>

<p>"Isn't it time the animals were fed?" she asked; and her own
voice surprised her, it was so natural and unstrained.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18">CHAPTER 18.</a><br>
"Tell me&mdash;Conchita&mdash;"</h2>

<p class="first">The meal, however, progressed under difficulties.
Even Nut seemed to sense a tension and refused to sit up or look
interested.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's tired of soup," Jacqueline said, with a wan attempt
at humor.</p>

<p>Sherry's answering laugh failed to suggest mirth.</p>

<p>"I'll go up to the roof and watch for rescuers," he announced,
avoiding her eyes.</p>

<p>Jacqueline made no effort to stop him. Why should she? He wasn't
hers. She had nothing&mdash;never could belong to any one&mdash;not
even to Consuelo. All morning and all afternoon she lay, and
tossed, and let her heart ache, hoping it would break and kill her.
Why had this man been allowed to come into her life to hurt her
cruelly again with the thought of what companionship might have
been?</p>

<p>Sherry swung himself into the doorway at last and stood looking
in her direction, with the evening glow behind him accustoming his
eyes to the darkness within.</p>

<p>"No rescue in sight?" she asked, feeling she must say something;
he looked so solemn and determined.</p>

<p>"No. Not yet. At least I haven't seen any&mdash;Conchita."</p>

<p>She felt startled&mdash;electrified. She almost jumped, and her
heart beat so that it frightened her.</p>

<p>"That is your name, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's one of my names."</p>

<p>She could not lie to him! She would not lie to him. If he asked
for her real name, she would simply refuse to answer.</p>

<p>"Would you mind coming over to the light? I can't see you in
there. I want to see your face distinctly."</p>

<p>Had he seen that newspaper before it was torn, and was he going
to try to identify her from memory? If so, she would lie to him!
There she stood looking at him, she against one side of the frame,
he against the other. It was a long time before he spoke, even
then, but he began with a rush at last, as if he had to force
himself to it and the resistance had broken suddenly.</p>

<p>"Conchita&mdash;I've been pondering all afternoon how to tell
you what I want to say&mdash;and I don't know now&mdash;but I'm
going to say it &mdash;and I want you to listen, please. And by the
way, my name's Sherry. I don't want you to call me Mr. Mansfield
any longer."</p>

<p>Heart-beats&mdash;so furious that she could not say a word! As
for Sherry it was already obvious enough to him that he was in for
failure, so he set his jaw hard.</p>

<p>"Will you please call me Sherry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sherry."</p>

<p>Gee! That sounded better. Hitherto he had always rather disliked
his name &mdash;wished it were George, or Frank, or something
regular.</p>

<p>"You don't know much about me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Except that she liked him awfully!</p>

<p>"And I don't want you to tell me a word about
yourself&mdash;until afterward. Any one with half an eye can see
you're in trouble, Conchita. I want you to understand that I'm
going it blind&mdash;that I don't know what the trouble is, and
don't care, except that I hate to see you in trouble of any kind.
And it's awful nerve of me, and all that&mdash;I know it is; and I
wouldn't say what I'm going to, if I wasn't sure you're in a
difficulty and may need some one who has a right to stand by you
and raise hell generally. I'll stand by you. I'm good at that."</p>

<p>Good at it? He looked like bravery itself! Tears came into her
eyes. How was she ever going to lie to him?</p>

<p>"You see&mdash;I want you to know that I love you as the way I
find you. I don't care a damn what sort mix-up you've got into; I'm
for you. You can tell me all about it afterward; and when you've
told me, I'll tell you again, what I say now, that I love you. But
I want you to understand that part first &mdash;that there aren't
any strings to it. I'll fight a way for you out of any sort of
mess."</p>

<p>She could not speak. She wanted to stop him, but not a word
would come. She held her hand up, but let it fall again.</p>

<p>He misinterpreted the gesture, naturally.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I know I have made a bad break, Conchita. I'd no
right to talk to you this way. But you've changed my whole ideas
about women. I know now there's one woman in the world, at any
rate, who isn't mean and selfish; and you've made me see that my
mother may have been so badly up against it that she couldn't help
herself. Damn! I can't put it into words. I've seen your soul! I
love you! There you are. If I've said anything offensive&mdash;if
I've done wrong&mdash;I'm sorry. I haven't meant to offend."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansfield&mdash;Sherry! But you haven't! I'm so grateful I
don't know what to say, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, Conchita?"</p>

<p>It was getting very dark. He could hardly see her eyes
now&mdash;only her outline leaning back against the door-frame, and
he thought she looked more distressed, and terribly weary, than
grateful.</p>

<p>"But there are reasons, Sherry&mdash;serious reasons
why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why what?"</p>

<p>"Why I can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't what? You haven't got to tell me anything. What I've said
stands forever, without&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why I can't!"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you can't love me&mdash;is that it?" he asked,
and his tone was resolute; there was no self-pity in it.</p>

<p>She shook her head. She could not lie to him. She meant to say
she did not love him; but she did&mdash;she did! She loved him
desperately, and her heart was faint at the thought of having to
refuse him.</p>

<p>"That isn't it, Conchita?"</p>

<p>No answer. She could not speak. He came a pace toward her, and
she struggled desperately to summon all her
resolution&mdash;thought of Desmio &mdash;of Sister
Michaela&mdash;of Consuelo. Then for a second Wahl's cavernous eyes
leered between her and Sherry; Sherry's replaced them, and looked
into hers. She could feel his breath, and oh! how her heart was
beating. She had no resolution&mdash;none whatever! She simply
loved him.</p>

<p>"Tell me, little girl. Do you love me, too?"</p>

<p>Silence&mdash;averted eyes.</p>

<p>"Conchita&mdash;do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>Then oh, what utter heaven for a minute as he took her into his
arms! They were strong arms&mdash;comforting&mdash;and she could
lean on him. He was kissing the top of her head, for her face was
buried in his shoulder, and she was not even thinking, she was
living. Desmio seemed quite near&mdash;and he was right, wasn't he,
after all? He said, someday there would be another man,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lookup first, Conchita. Won't you lookup?"</p>

<p>Their lips had not yet touched when a blinding ray of light
swept by them &mdash;back again&mdash;wavered a moment, and then
played on them steadily. Nut began barking. The light came from a
pin-point in the distance, and they heard the chugging of a
motor-launch.</p>

<p>"Damn!" exclaimed Sherry. "They've come for us!"</p>

<p>They held hands and watched the light. To Jacqueline it was the
hideous eye of doom&mdash;of nemesis, from which there was no
escape. She expected to see Wahl in the launch. She did not hear
what Sherry said to her although she knew he was saying something;
she stood dumb, numbed again, shuddering at nameless fear. She
might have known this dream was too good to be true.</p>

<p>"Cold? Here, put my coat on!"</p>

<p>He slipped the coat over her shoulders, hugged her a moment, and
ran to gather up the cats, herding them into a basket he found on a
nail on the wall. Then he came back and waited beside her, holding
the dog on a string.</p>

<p>"Soon as we get ashore we'll find your&mdash;was that your
mother by the way?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, for a man's voice called out of the
night:</p>

<p>"How long have you all been here? Are you all right? Just two of
you? Steady now&mdash;back her a bit&mdash;that'll do, Mose.
Why&mdash;hello, feller! You again?"</p>

<p>The inspector of levees, gaunt and unshaven, held out a lean
hand to Jacqueline, and she stepped down into the world she
dreaded. Sherry followed and spilled cats on the seat beside
her.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Mose."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19">CHAPTER 19.</a><br>
"You to repay&mdash;"</h2>

<p class="first">The launch ran down a lane between two shimmering
reflections of the watch fires, and shoved its nose into a bank
where a state militiaman leaned on a rifle and yelled "Hi, there!
Here's two more!" There was a murmur of voices, and a great deal of
moving to and fro in the shadows between the fires&mdash;dogs
barking&mdash;the lowing of a cow&mdash;a chorus of squalling
infants. Army tents loomed out of the gloom. There was a smell of
wet clothes, and hot soup; and some one&mdash;a small boy
probably&mdash;was beating an empty bucket with an iron spoon.</p>

<p>"Step lively," advised the militiaman, "there's others
waiting."</p>

<p>Jacqueline took Sherry's hand and stepped on to the bank. Nut
barked like an idiot, and the cats all tried to get out of the
basket at the same time, until Sherry took the lot to a Negro
mammy, who laughed and said "La-a-an' sakes!" and walked off with
them, nobody could guess where.</p>

<p>"Back her a bit, Mose! So-o-easy now. Go ahead!"</p>

<p>The launch chugged away and was lost between the liquid lanes of
firelight. Sherry put his arm around Jacqueline's waist and led her
toward a great tree where some boxes were piled in disorder and
another militiaman stood half in shadow with firelight gleaming on
his rifle barrel and on the brass of his accouterments.</p>

<p>"Now, sweetheart mine," said Sherry, "will you sit on a box
right here while I scout around a bit! Stay put, though, won't you!
Looks like a thousand people here. I'll never find you again if you
move away."</p>

<p>He spoke to the militiaman, who nodded. Jacqueline sat still,
feeling as if she were dreaming, and watched Sherry walk off with
Nut at his heels. She watched him pass into the firelight by a tent
not fifty paces off, and pause there to ask a question of some one
in the tent. A man came running out &mdash;shook hands with Sherry.
She felt herself trembling; but she wasn't cold. She had Sherry's
coat on.</p>

<p>She heard the man's voice, and thought she recognized it.</p>

<p>"&mdash;No, they took no chances&mdash;stopped the Limited
before the levee broke, so I had to do flood-stuff after all. Fair
story, too. Where have you been? Say: did you read that newspaper I
gave you? The Lanier girl bolted&mdash;I told you she was a bad
lot. The latest is that she got caught in the flood and was
drowned&mdash;they've found the horses, and got the nigger who
drove her. He says he thinks she was drowned, but he doesn't know,
and I've a hunch she wasn't. Now if you can find her, we can make
this flood read like history!"</p>

<p>He turned with his face toward the firelight. She nearly
screamed. It was Wahl!</p>

<p>Flight&mdash;instant flight&mdash;anywhere! Only a pause for a
second to lay Sherry's coat down on the box. Then off into the
shadows&mdash; running&mdash;running. The militiaman called
something after her, but that only lent her wings. She was fleet of
foot always&mdash;ran like a roused doe&mdash;anywhere&mdash;out
into the night, away from the people and the fires&mdash;away from
Wahl, with his ghoul's eyes haunting her&mdash;and the bedroom
scene burning in her brain, and Wahl's hand on her wrist, and his
mean voice: "Now then&mdash;out with it! Tell me all you know!"</p>

<p>She stumbled&mdash;hit things in the dark&mdash;ran on, sobbing
for breath&mdash;fell&mdash;rose again&mdash;was frightened nearly
out of her wits by a big dog that gave chase, but stumbled over a
stick, picked it up, and struck the dog, sending him off
yelping&mdash;ran on again, and at last fell breathless at the root
of a tree, where she lay sobbing with a stitch that gnawed her
side. When her head ceased swimming at last she could see the
outline of the camp a mile away, and people moving back and forth
before the fires.</p>

<p>She had no notion what to do, except to keep on going as soon as
her body would let her. Sherry would tell Wahl about her&mdash;why
shouldn't he? &mdash;and Wahl would recognize the description. They
were both newspaper men. Sherry would believe Wahl. Of course he
would. Why not? So she must never see Sherry again. And oh, how
that thought hurt. It was far worse than the pain in her side.
Never mind, she was glad&mdash;she was glad! He had loved her for a
minute. She would love him forever!</p>

<p>Up again&mdash;voices&mdash;she must run. No path now, only a
track that might lead anywhere, and was full of places where you
fell, and things that stuck out and struck you, and strange noises.
On&mdash;on&mdash;stockings torn, hands bruised, and Wahl's face
ever behind her, grinning out from the circle at the top of a page,
or leering at her over Desmio's body. She could not get away from
him, and yet she must, or she would go mad.</p>

<p>Black darkness&mdash;forward! A blind step&mdash;and nothing
underfoot &mdash;down&mdash;down, forever it seemed&mdash;and then
soft earth came up and hit her, and she lay for a minute squeezing
mud between her fingers, moving herself carefully, to learn if
anything was broken. But she was only bruised, and Wahl was there
behind her. On again!</p>

<p>Then light between chinks in a shutter straight
ahead&mdash;house? &mdash;cabin?&mdash;it was something,
anyhow&mdash;somewhere to hide. Perhaps they would let her stay
there a little while, until she was able to go on again. She was
dreadfully tired. They wouldn't know who she was, and she would be
gone before morning. She must think of something to say though.
Well, she couldn't think just then. She would do that later.</p>

<p>What an awful time they were about opening the door! She could
hear them &mdash;could hear them talking. Wouldn't they ever come?
She would fall down dead, if they didn't open in a minute! Ah!</p>

<p>Light flashed in her face, and a woman screamed.</p>

<p>"Conchita!"</p>

<p>She shut her eyes and fell forward into Consuelo's arms,
half-consciously aware of curious faces that peered over-shoulder
at her&mdash;and of cigarette smoke&mdash;and of a fire that burned
brightly in a grate. Then she was on the floor, with her head in
Consuelo's lap, and Consuelo sobbing over her, running fingers
through her hair and crying to the Blessed Virgin. There was a
child fast asleep in blankets before the fire, and some kind of
animal coiled up beside the child. And she could see a man's feet;
he had bell-bottomed trousers, and was sitting in a chair that was
tilted backward on two legs. She wondered how long the chair would
balance that way without falling. The man was speaking to some one,
and she could not see who the other person was, but after a while
she caught a word or two. They were talking some foreign language.
Funny: it sounded like Spanish, and yet she could not understand a
word of it, although she knew Spanish rather well. The man had a
pleasant voice; the other was a woman's&mdash;not Consuelo's, and
not so pleasant. It jarred a little.</p>

<p>Another funny thing: she knew that Consuelo understood what they
were saying. Not that Consuelo joined in the conversation, or said
anything, or made any sign. She just knew it, that was all, the way
you know things in a dream. They were talking about herself, and
Consuelo was listening without letting them know she understood.
She was as sure about that as if Consuelo had told her so.</p>

<p>Presently the man began to speak in English to Consuelo; and now
it was Jacqueline's turn to listen without anybody knowing it. She
closed her eyes. The man spoke as if he were smiling, and she could
almost see him flourishing a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Senora, we have&mdash;my mother and I&mdash;have
made&mdash;what is it?&mdash;a spic&mdash;no, speculation. We do
ourselves the honor to propose&mdash;as a favor to you&mdash;and
assuming to ourselves a certain risk&mdash;that if la bella
senorita is consenting&mdash;you and she &mdash;she and you should
favor us with your accompaniment to San Francisco."</p>

<p>"That's a long way. We've no money," Consuelo answered sternly,
almost belligerently.</p>

<p>"Gracias a Deus, Senora, we&mdash;I and my mother, that
is&mdash;are &mdash;less unfavorably situated. At the moment we
have a small sufficiency. We do ourselves the honor to propose to
you&mdash;a small loan&mdash;in proportion to our no great
affluence a trifle a mere bagatelle&mdash;in ordinary
circumstances&mdash;doubtless&mdash;beneath your distinguished
consideration&mdash;but sufficient for such pressing needs as
billets de voyage. Repayable&mdash;to my mother and to me&mdash;at
your honorable convenience."</p>

<p>"And on your terms, I suppose!" Consuelo almost snapped the
words at him.</p>

<p>"The Senora may justly be pardoned for speaking
with&mdash;acerbity. But we are not&mdash;I and my mother are
not&mdash;money-lenders. There does
appear&mdash;nevertheless&mdash;Senora, the indication of a
predicament, in which you&mdash;discover yourself&mdash;and out of
the vast fortune that&mdash;</p>

<p>"You think you can make money out of us! How?" snapped
Consuelo.</p>

<p>"It amuses the Senora to be sarcastic. Surely&mdash;does the
Senora think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never you mind what I think just at present, Senor Ramon.
You're not offering to lend me money for my good looks. What's in
your head? I'm listening."</p>

<p>The man hesitated. "You recall, doubtless, Senora, that my
mother and I were privileged to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were at the wedding, yes."</p>

<p>"La Conchita danced."</p>

<p>"So that's it? You expect her to go on the stage? To dance at
garden parties? To&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed apologetically. "Pardon, Senora, one moment! There
would have to be preliminaries before that could happen. It is
true, La Conchita dances like a seraph, but the public does not pay
to be entertained seraphically. There is lacking&mdash;what is the
word?&mdash;what the French name diablerie."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>diablerie</i> (French)&mdash;deviltry;
witchcraft; sorcery. <i><a href=
"http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/D0192100.html">The American Heritage
Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

<p>"You'd like to make her devilish? The Lord forbid!"</p>

<p>"Senora, it is the&mdash;assumption of diablerie that
entertains. The article itself is of no value. Permit me to assure
you that&mdash;the greater the appearance of diablerie&mdash;and
the less there actually is of it&mdash;the more the public is eager
to pay for admission. But surely there is no need to discuss
that&mdash;my mother and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll have to show me!" snapped Consuelo.</p>

<p>"Senora, why not? To one of your noted intelligence and serious
concern for the beloved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's asleep now. When she wakes, we'll hear what she says. But
understand this, Senor Ramon: If she accepts any money from you,
she'll never be out of my sight for a minute!"</p>

<p>"Senora, you fill me with admiration! The adorable Conchita is
indeed fortunate! My compliments!"</p>

<p>Consuelo seemed to care very little for his compliments.</p>

<p>"Put your proposal into plain words," she demanded.</p>

<p>"A brief memorandum of agreement, Senora. We&mdash;my mother and
I &mdash;advance expenses. You to repay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suppose we can't repay?"</p>

<p>He laughed that ridiculous suggestion to the four winds.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;in that case&mdash;hah! absurd&mdash;why build
imaginary pictures?&mdash;still, in that case hah&mdash;conceive of
it&mdash;then I would have to teach the pep-zip-snap! Could she not
dance! Is she not beautiful! The world is full of money and if we
please the public, some of the money becomes ours&mdash;why
not?"</p>

<p>Consuelo was merely sparring with him&mdash;inclined to clutch
at straws, but thoroughly distrustful. These people knew who
Jacqueline was, and understood perfectly that she was running away,
and why, for they had seen the newspaper. Her only chance of
getting them to hold their tongues would be to accept their
proposal, otherwise they would almost certainly give information
for the sake of possible reward.</p>

<p>"Leave us alone. I will talk to her," she demanded.</p>

<p>"There is but the one room, Senora."</p>

<p>"There is outdoors, isn't there?"</p>

<p>The door was slammed as if one person, if not two, resented an
imposition. Then Jacqueline opened her eyes&mdash;sat up&mdash;and
looked around the cabin.</p>

<p>"What place is this?"</p>

<p>"It's a foreman's cabin, dear. Ramon paid him for the use of it,
so as to get away from the refugees. Were you asleep, honey, or
were you listening?"</p>

<p>"I heard."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking, Consuelo. I can't. I want to run away
forever!"</p>

<p>"Honey child, you're starving! Where have you been? What
happened? No, don't tell me now&mdash;there isn't time. We must
make up our minds about Ramon's offer."</p>

<p>Jacqueline had no in intention of telling. She knew that, if
nothing else. She would never tell any one in all the world about
Sherry Mansfield. That was her secret, to be hugged in her heart
and remembered.</p>

<p>"It makes no difference to me what happens, Consuelo, as long as
we go where nobody can find us."</p>

<p>"Listen, honey. Ramon and his mother were talking Portuguese,
and I understand it, although I can't talk it much. They think
you'll have money by and by. Cervanez was saying to Ramon that
you're only running away from scandal, and that's true, honey, you
know that. Cervanez thinks that sooner or later the lawyers will
have to advertise for you, and then they'll get a big reward for
having taken care of you. We must do something, honey. I've lost
the bank-book, and the good Lord knows how long it's going to take
to get my three hundred dollars; and if I ever get it, it'll be
gone in no time. We've lost all your jewelry. We've simply nothing.
They offer to pay our expenses to San Francisco. Shall we let
them?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline nodded. There was something about the word San
Francisco that suggested vague forebodings; but her thoughts were
hardly functioning. She did not consciously associate Sherry or
Wahl with San Francisco&mdash;did not associate them, in fact, with
any place. Wahl was the devil's own&mdash;the absolute of
evil&mdash;darkness. Sherry was heaven's own&mdash;light.</p>

<p>"We must run away. I saw Wahl," she said quietly, and Consuelo
shuddered. Reason may fail, when fear has become an obsession, and
there was something ominous in Jacqueline's lack of interest.</p>

<p>"I will get you some food now, honey."</p>

<p>Jacqueline shook her head.</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt Consuelo saved Jacqueline's life, for the desire
to live was lacking. Even seventeen was hopeless. Hope had to be
supplied by some one else, and no hope could have reached her
without love's all-penetrating flux. Consuelo alternately prayed,
coaxed, petted, scolded, stormed&mdash;came near to slapping
her!&mdash;then hugged and babied her back to some semblance of
animation.</p>

<p>But the rest of that night, and all the next day, and the next
were like a waking dream to Jacqueline. She remembered that at dawn
they began to walk interminable miles, that a monkey sat on her
shoulder part of the time, and that some one named Pepita cried a
great deal and was scolded. But she had been in a train two days
before she began to respond to Pepita's sympathy; the child climbed
on her lap and baby-talked in broken English until Jacqueline found
herself responding&mdash;and awoke.</p>

<p>It was not until then that she knew how her hands and knees
hurt, where she had bruised them in falling; or that she was
dressed in Cervanez' second- best skirt; or that people in the
train were curious about her. Life began to be interesting&mdash;as
if she had died, and were beginning life all over once more
somewhere else. Ramon came in from the smoking-car at intervals and
made himself agreeable. He was very respectful&mdash;called her
senorita &mdash;and seemed to be a handsome, care-free, amusing
fellow. When the train waited in a station long enough, he took
them all to the baggage car to visit with the monkey, who chattered
and clung to Pepita every time, but seemed to like Jacqueline next
best. And in the dining-car Ramon turned every meal into a great
event, even making funny, little speeches in mispronounced English
that caused roars of laughter. He was good-tempered even when his
mother, Cervanez, scolded him for extravagance, and no matter how
much Cervanez nudged him, or what pointed hints she let fall, he
always ordered odds and ends of things, such as celery and olives,
that made the fare appetizing.</p>

<p>Although he was Brazilian, not Spanish, he had all the graceful
Spanish manners, and the little, straight side-whiskers he wore
gave him a picturesque appearance that went well with his laughing
eyes and his romantic way of walking. He did everything gracefully,
even when he gave the dining-car waiter about half the usual tip,
and&mdash;although he smoked incessantly he never had to buy cigars
or cigarettes because the men in the smoking-room forced theirs on
him.</p>

<p>"He is perfect&mdash;best of all men in the world, my son!"
Cervanez confided in one of her more melting moods. "Nothing never
happen too bad but he succeed always! Only always spending too
much," she added. "By and by he is spending too much money for you.
I watch him!"</p>

<p>Pepita, Jacqueline learned, was an adopted orphan whom Ramon
hoped to educate into a great dancer one of these days.</p>

<p>Little by little Jacqueline awoke to what was happening, feeling
her way as it were into a new universe, with which the old had no
connection. Being naturally strong and healthy, her body recovered
first; so that Ramon, and others, began to admire her before her
own intelligence made her aware of the fact. Consuelo said very
little to her on the train, but watched as meticulously as Cervanez
watched Ramon, not knowing whether to be alarmed or gratified by
what she observed.</p>

<p>For a strange process was going on. Life grows out of death in
every phase of nature, and Jacqueline was no exception. Protection,
seclusion, sheltered affluence all gone; the past dead; the future
unrevealed; a new ability was dawning. There was being born in
Jacqueline, as gradually yet as certainly as sap springs in trees
at winter's end, a power to adjoin herself to new conditions. It
came as a shock to Consuelo to discover that the child had grown
into a woman almost overnight, and that as her brain recovered from
its dazed condition she accepted, as if they were natural,
conditions against which the older woman's habit-bound soul
stubbornly revolted. It began to be Consuelo who was lonely and
bewildered; Jacqueline who knew how to make the best of things.</p>

<p>What made it worse for Consuelo was conviction that Jacqueline
was keeping a secret from her; that in order to keep her secret she
preferred Cervanez' and Pepita's company; and that the secret was
not just a mood, but something definite that had taken place. For
you can't deceive an old nurse, though you can keep her in the
dark.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20">CHAPTER 20.</a><br>
"Not easy to trace."</h2>

<p class="first">Plunge hot metal into cold water, and you learn
its nature. Steel takes on temper. Sherry Mansfield talked with
Wahl, turned back to find Jacqueline&mdash;and did not lose his
head for a fraction of a second. But he reacted. The Gods who forge
men on the anvils of circumstance had chosen good steel&mdash;and
the moment.</p>

<p>"Where did she go?" he asked the militiaman.</p>

<p>"Search me! Looked that a-way&mdash;seen somethin'&mdash;an'
jes' ran."</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>"Any of way, if you ast me! Me, I yells to her, but' she's
crazy, I guess. Skeered out of her wits."</p>

<p>Wahl&mdash;slowly for the first ten strides, then swiftly,
making no noise&mdash;approached from the direction of the tent,
and Sherry was first aware of him when the militia-man moved his
eyes. He faced about, conscious of a revolution in his own
attitude. He suddenly mistrusted Wahl.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Wahl demanded, possessed of a new sharp air of
authority since he had heard from Mansfield senior.</p>

<p>"Nothing serious," Sherry answered.</p>

<p>Wahl disbelieved him. He had overheard a part of what the sentry
said; but he also recognized the hint of something sealed in
Sherry's face. He decided to pump Sherry first, and the sentry
later.</p>

<p>"There's your choice of bootleg, cocoa or coffee in the tent.
Come and tell me where you've been."</p>

<p>Sherry went with him. Anything to throw Wahl off the scent. As
clearly as that pin-point of light from the launch had shone on the
hayloft door, and as suddenly it had dawned on Sherry that the
subject of Wahl's whole front page in the New Orleans Star, and the
girl he knew he loved, might be one and the same. It was a shock,
and he braced himself to meet it, falling back on silence which is
the first and last resource of strength.</p>

<p>She had not told him her real name, he remembered; or at least,
she had not stated that her real name was Conchita Martinez. Was
she Jacqueline Lanier? Maybe. Much nicer name! If so, was she what
Wahl had said she was? Not if Sherry Mansfield knew anything! If
she was Jacqueline Lanier, then she needed help; and if he was
Sherry Mansfield, she should have it!</p>

<p>"Cocoa? Coffee? Where were you all this time?" Wahl asked him,
offering an empty box to sit on. "Where did you get that mongrel?
You've been in the water, I can see that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I swam in after the dog and nearly got drowned, but reached
a floating roof, and lay on that a long time. Fellow rescued me in
a launch finally."</p>

<p>"Anybody with you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Thought I saw a girl get out of that launch when you did."</p>

<p>"Oh, he rescued her too."</p>

<p>"Before he found you, or afterward?"</p>

<p>"She was in the launch when I got into it."</p>

<p>"Know her name?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Good lord, man&mdash;and you a reporter!"</p>

<p>"I was nearly drowned," said Sherry.</p>

<p>Wahl turned away, to look at him suddenly sidewise in the
lantern-light. He was suspicious, and Sherry was perfectly aware of
that. He could hardly sit still and drink coffee for anxiety to do
two things: he must go at once in search of her; and he must find
that levee-inspector, and persuade him to tell Wahl nothing. But
his good sense warned him that it was more important at the moment
to stay where he was and checkmate Wahl.</p>

<p>"Have you a list of the refugees in the camp?" he asked.</p>

<p>Wahl tossed him several sheets of paper, and Sherry glanced them
over until he found the name of Consuelo Martinez.</p>

<p>"What does it mean when you put three stars after a name?"</p>

<p>"Taken care of by some one&mdash;no longer destitute."</p>

<p>There were three stars after Consuelo's name.</p>

<p>"Where can I find out who has taken care of whom?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I can tell you. Who are you interested in?"</p>

<p>"Nobody in particular. I asked a question."</p>

<p>"Well, there's more or less confusion. Once they're off the
destitute list they're not easy to trace."</p>

<p>Wahl was now more than suspicious; he was nearly positive that
Sherry was concealing something. He decided to go out and question
the sentry while the man's memory was still fresh.</p>

<p>"Will you stay here?" he asked. "I'll be back in a minute."</p>

<p>Wahl strolled out, not hurrying until he thought himself out of
Sherry's sight. Then he moved swiftly. But the sentry had been
relieved, and another man stood in his place.</p>

<p>"Where's the other fellow gone?" Wahl demanded.</p>

<p>"Search me! He'd be turnin' in, only they wanted men to go an'
round up stray cows or somethin'. Bill knows cows, so the sergeant
ordered him to volunteer."</p>

<br>

<p>Wahl returned to the tent in disgust. The tin cup, half full of
coffee yet, stood exactly in the middle of the box, on which Sherry
had been sitting. Sherry was missing. Wahl went to the tent-door
and shouted. Another reporter came hurrying, eager to know what the
great Clinton Wahl could be in so much stew about.</p>

<p>"Harris&mdash;Look here: There's a launch starting before
daylight to make connections with the train above where the levee
broke. I'm off for San Francisco; here's a chance for you. You know
who Jacqueline Lanier is!"</p>

<p>You bet! You've told the world that all right!"</p>

<p>"She's around here somewhere!"</p>

<p>"Hell, no! She was drowned&mdash;they found the horses and
buggy."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it! She's been rescued. She's hiding
somewhere probably under a false name. Now listen: you find her,
and wire the San Francisco Tribune. Bet on me to make it worth your
while. Get her story if you can, and if you do, wire that. But
let's know the minute you've found her. It'll be the biggest thing
you've ever done, and I'll see you get credit."</p>

<p>"Say, that's mighty decent of you! Say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get busy!" Wahl interrupted.</p>

<p>Wahl himself went in search of the launch that had rescued
Sherry, and found it after a while nosing into the bank lower down.
Again he was too late; the inspector and engineer had been
relieved, and had gone away to sleep, nobody knew where. So he went
in search of Sherry, but might as well have hunted for a needle in
a haystack.</p>

<p>Sherry Mansfield's brain was working with a kind of cold frenzy.
He never wavered once. He faced the possibility that that girl was
Jacqueline Lanier, and that some one of her actions might have
justified Wahl in mistaking her for an adventuress, and he did not
care. Wahl presumably had all the evidence, and he, Sherry
Mansfield, had none. He needed none. He would back one look into
her eyes against all Wahl's reasoning and experience. She was good.
She was pure and innocent. What was more&mdash;and he said it again
and again, for the sheer joy of stabbing at his own dead
misconceptions &mdash;he, Sherry, loved her.</p>

<p>"God, I'll prove it too!" he muttered.</p>

<p>But to begin to prove it, he must find her. He thought at first
that the dog might recognize her scent, but either Nut was no sort
of bloodhound, or else too many other folk had crossed the trail.
Nut's chief ambition seemed to be not to lose sight of his new
owner. Urging was sheer waste of time.</p>

<p>Then he thought of Consuelo Martinez; but she had been marked
with three stars, and though he went to the tent inquire for her,
all that the woman in charge could tell him was that Consuelo had
recognized some friends and had gone away with them.</p>

<p>"I seem to remember they were foreigners, but I'm not sure. The
poor woman was distracted, but she suddenly saw people she knew and
ran to them. They said they had somewhere to go, and some money,
and agreed to look after her. At least, I think that's right.
There's been much&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Sherry had gone already, and she found herself talking to
the night.</p>

<p>"Funny!" he told himself. "Two days ago I'd have been cynical
about that. Another case of a mother deserting her child! Makes me
feel sure now that that fat old thing wasn't her mother after all.
God! I hope her name is Jacqueline; I like it."</p>

<p>More systematically than he ever rooted at a story Sherry
searched the camp all night in widening rings, and when dawn came
he met Harris in the mouth of the porters' tent&mdash;both men in
search of food.</p>

<p>"Doing anything?" asked Harris, with his mouth full of bread and
cocoa. "Tell you why. I've been tipped off that Jacqueline Lanier's
somewhere about. Like to help me find her?"</p>

<p>Sherry nodded, looking over the edge of a tin mug, sizing up his
man. He could lick him; he was sure of it. If they two should find
Jacqueline, there would only be one who would identify her!</p>

<p>"Saw you talking to Clinton Wahl," said Harris. "Know him
well?"</p>

<p>"Only slightly."</p>

<p>"What paper are you for?"</p>

<p>"None just now."</p>

<p>That was cold truth. There was not a newspaper under heaven that
could come just then between Sherry Mansfield and his quest. He had
made up his mind to face his father, and if need be, to defy him.
There was nothing to argue about; nothing to compromise. Whether or
not that girl was Jacqueline Lanier, she was his girl&mdash;his
forever.</p>

<p>"Finished? Come on then," said Harris. "There are some cabins
down on the bottoms beyond here. Let's search them first."</p>

<p>At the end of twenty minutes' rather random walking they crossed
a trail where Sherry saw small footprints in the mud, and Nut grew
unaccountably excited&mdash;not behaving as a hunting dog would,
but as the good-for- nothing, cheery mongrel that he was, who
recognized something familiar.</p>

<p>"This way," said Sherry.</p>

<p>"That way's no good, that's a cow-path."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself."</p>

<p>Sherry took his own line, turning to the right, and Harris
followed more for the sake of preventing Sherry from forestalling
him than because he thought it a likely trail to follow. It was not
very long before the track led down a steep bank, with imprints in
the mud below that looked as if someone had fallen there. And two
hundred yards beyond that, in a hollow, there was a neat, clean
cabin with a faint wisp of smoke emerging from the chimney.</p>

<p>"Hell! Who'd ha' thought it?" said Harris.</p>

<p>But Sherry said nothing; only his clenched fist went into his
hip pocket for some reason.</p>

<p>"This is my story. I'll go ahead," said Harris.</p>

<p>"No, you won't."</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;look here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You heard me!"</p>

<p>"Who the hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll wait here until I see what's in there. Would you rather
fight?"</p>

<p>That right fist was still in the hip pocket, and Harris
suspected a gun.</p>

<p>"What's the big idea?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"If you think you can lick me, go ahead and try!"</p>

<p>"I'll watch," said Harris.</p>

<p>"Stay right here then!"</p>

<p>Sherry walked ahead, and Harris, who was awfully tired and
sleepy, sat down. Whatever his other argument was, he kept it to
himself. The cabin door was latched, but not locked; Sherry opened
it, and entered.</p>

<p>There was nobody there, but the embers of a dying fire were
smoking on the hearth and there was plenty of evidence that the
place had been occupied quite recently. However, the chair-seats
were no longer warm, although mud in several places on the floor
was hardly dry. Some one had probably left within the hour; within
two hours at the utmost.</p>

<p>He found a hairpin, and threw it in the fire, lest Harris should
find it too, and draw conclusions. Next his eye fell on a scrap of
torn lace on the floor not far from the hearth. It was crumpled and
mud-stained, but he could almost swear that it tallied with the
pattern of the edging and collar of the dress she had worn. No mere
man, he admitted, could be quite sure of a thing like that from
memory; but he had a strong hunch, and Nut was acting
interested.</p>

<p>There was a rug between mid-room and hearth; it looked as if
someone had sat on it, for it was rumpled. Sherry kicked up the
rumpled edge and suddenly pounced on a piece of pale blue
ribbon.</p>

<p>"It's been in the water. It's knotted and tied the same way.
Same color. Same&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held it to the light. Six or eight strands of long dark hair
were caught tightly in the knot.</p>

<p>"I'll bet my last dollar!"</p>

<p>He folded the ribbon and hair into the same envelope, and began
to look about for further evidence, but there was nothing; and he
was presently aware of Harris peeking through the chink of the
half-open door. The key was on the inside.</p>

<p>"You can come in if you want to," he called.</p>

<p>"Found anything?" asked Harris.</p>

<p>"No. You have a look."</p>

<p>They passed each other in the doorway. Sherry took the key with
him. The moment Harris was inside Sherry shut the door quietly and
locked him in: whereafter he walked around the cabin and observed
that the shutters were all in place and fastened on the outside
with iron bars.</p>

<p>So much for Harris. Sherry began quartering the ground in front
of the cabin, and presently found footsteps in the mud. There was
no doubt of the direction. They were the footprints of three women
and a man, and he set out along the muddy track as fast as he could
lay foot to the ground.</p>

<p>But the track turned up a high bank to a road, and on the road
he lost all trace of footprints; nor was Nut the least use. It was
more than an hour before he found an old darky, who told him the
road would lead to a railroad depot if he followed it far enough.
But the darky didn't know how far&mdash; couldn't 'member.</p>

<p>Sherry lost more time questioning strangers whom he met; and
several times he went far off the road to inquire at cabins, but
without result. It was nearly noon before he reached a railroad
station, and learned that there would be no more trains northward
until evening. He questioned the station agent.</p>

<p>"Refugees? Scores of 'em. Three full train-loads this
morning."</p>

<p>"Any buy tickets here?"</p>

<p>"Some. Most had passes from the Relief Committee."</p>

<p>Sherry described Jacqueline as accurately as he could. She had
two legs, for instance&mdash;two arms&mdash;was about so
high&mdash;dark hair &mdash;probably no hat&mdash;</p>

<p>"She wore a locket on a gold chain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blue eyes, you say? Deep blue? Sure&mdash;I guess I 'member
'em. Pretty little miss, all tired out, layin' her head on a big
fat woman's shoulder over on the bench there. No, they didn't buy
no tickets. Lemme see."</p>

<p>The agent scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Yeah. There was a&mdash;Wop&mdash;or a Dago, mebbe&mdash;'n'
another woman with him, 'n' a kid yes, sure there was a kid.
Aye,&mdash;'n' they had a monkey&mdash;or the kid had. Four an' a
half to Frisco, 'n' two sections was what they wanted. Told 'em I
couldn't do it. Had to send 'em on to the junction, but I phoned
for 'em, I 'member. Sure&mdash;Frisco&mdash;that's it.
Yeah&mdash;the Wop had the money. It was all one party. I 'member.
N-o-o, son. Six o'clock to the junction's your first train, 'n' you
can catch the midnight on from there for Frisco by way o' St.
Louis."</p>

<p>Sherry wished now he had kept that newspaper, instead of letting
the dog tear it into shreds. At least he could have read Wahl's
story, and have analyzed it; that would be better than pacing the
platform and waiting for a damned slow train. He was pretty nearly
sure now that Conchita's name was really Jacqueline; and absolutely
sure that by that, or any other name, she was wonderful, and that
he loved her.</p>

<p>But why had she run away from him? The militiaman said she
looked scared to death. What suddenly frightened her? Wahl? He
wished he knew what Wahl had done to her when he got that story. It
was possible she saw Wahl when he came out of the tent.</p>

<p>Why had he ever liked Wahl, he wondered. Clever devil,
certainly; but a devil&mdash;a mean devil, with a mean face. And
who was this gang she was with? A kid and a monkey sounded like an
organ grinder's outfit. The big fat woman might be Consuelo
Martinez. But who were the Wop, or the Dago, and the other
woman?</p>

<p>Sherry was still pacing the platform when two sisters in convent
dress approached the station agent, and one of them questioned him
so persistently that he scratched his head. Sherry did not pay much
attention to them but, once, he saw the station agent jerk a thumb
in his direction&mdash;heard him address one of the women as Sister
Michaela&mdash;and saw the sister's gray eyes focused on
himself.</p>

<p>The next time he passed them his ears caught one sentence,
spoken in a voice as level as the gray eyes: "Will you please not
give information about this, then, to anybody else?"</p>

<p>And after that, for fifteen minutes, he was conscious of Sister
Michaela's gray eyes watching him, until the six o'clock train
rolled in, and he boarded it and left both sisters standing on the
platform.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21">CHAPTER 21.</a><br>
Bells obey the ears that listen</h2>

<p class="first">No star, however small and distant, leaves its
course without a Cosmos feeling it. Convents are small universes.
None in the convent spoke openly of Jacqueline, for that was
forbidden. Sister Michaela's duty had been done; the pistol-shots
had hardly more than announced a tragedy in Miro's house before she
gathered up her brood of bidden guests, herded them into the bus
and hurried them back to safety within convent walls. They knew
practically nothing of what had happened, and she instructed them
to tell not even that much. But the convent drooped none the less,
and even the bell tolled miserably. Bells obey the ears that
listen.</p>

<p>A week went by in silence, emphasized by routine sounds, none
naming tragedy, yet everybody conscious of it. Lessons continued,
and the silence gradually took effect. The waves on the surface
ceased. But there was a ground-swell. The sisters had all read the
papers. Don Andres Miro had been lavish with enduring gifts. All
had loved Jacqueline.</p>

<p>Routine&mdash;but Sister Michaela absent more than once, and
another in her place to toll the bell, not quite successfully. No
hint of where she had been on her return, except that it was known
that she was closeted for hours with the Sister Superior. And none
except the lay sister at the gate knew when John Miro drove up in a
muddied car; and when the Sister Superior and Sister Michaela
interviewed him in the drawing-room, only they three knew what took
place.</p>

<p>John Miro was a taller, sprightlier Don Andres, with the least
suggestion of more energy well gloved under a cultivated calm. He
was about the same age &mdash;possessed of the same unchallengeable
dignity; but one could imagine that he viewed life humorously,
rather than as a procession of pious duties. Both sisters felt a
little on guard against him, although they tried not to betray that
by their manner. He glanced, perhaps, a mite too keenly at their
faces under the deep white bandeaux.</p>

<p>"I came about Jacqueline Lanier," he said abruptly, breaking
ground at once.</p>

<p>The Sister Superior bowed in silence. It was Sister Michaela
whose eyes seemed to offer a suggestion of encouragement.</p>

<p>"I don't propose to believe she was drowned in the flood until
that's proved conclusively," he went on. "I have fifty men out
searching for her, but they've found no trace, although the horses,
and the carriage she drove away in were found the first day. All
the other missing bodies have been found. Hers and Consuelo's are
the only two unaccounted for. Presuming then that she's alive, can
you give me an inkling of what might have happened to her?"</p>

<p>"You read the newspapers, Mr. Miro?" the Sister Superior asked
him.</p>

<p>He smiled&mdash;exactly as Don Andres would have done&mdash;like
a swordsman.</p>

<p>"Yes. I have also spoken with Donna Isabella. That is why I am
doing everything in my power to find Jacqueline. If ever a poor
little woman needed help, I think she does. She shall have it, if I
can find her."</p>

<p>"If she is alive, she surely needs your help, Mr. Miro. But I
don't think you will find her in Louisiana."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Sister Michaela believes she has traced her to a railroad
station, and there seems to be a possibility that she went to San
Francisco with some refugees from the flood whose names are
unknown."</p>

<p>"Pardon me. Didn't you follow up that clue? Did you do nothing
about it?"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22">CHAPTER 22.</a><br>
The underworld</h2>

<p class="first">Life in lodgings is only miserable when you are
old, or too used to it. At seventeen, all that is new is amusing at
first, unless it actually hurts, and it was Consuelo, not
Jacqueline, who cried at sight of the dingy back- bedroom they must
share between them in a noisy San Francisco back street, not far
from the almost equally dingy café where Ramon and Cervanez were
booked for a month's engagement.</p>

<p>They were hardly in the place when Consuelo snorted and
rebelled.</p>

<p>"My word! We'll soon be out of this, Conchita!"</p>

<p>"But how, Consuelo, since we have no money?"</p>

<p>"There's plenty of money in San Francisco, honey. Mr. John Miro
lives here. He's rich. Just you see what happens when I've been to
him and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Consuelo! That man was Desmio's enemy."</p>

<p>Because she herself was loyal, Consuelo understood. Almost as
much as Jacqueline, she had become imbued with Don Andres Miro's
Old-World notions of fealty and pride.</p>

<p>"Very well, honey," she answered meekly. "But I don't think even
Don Andres' enemy would let you stay in this place, if he
knew."</p>

<p>"He'll never know," said Jacqueline, shutting her mouth
tight.</p>

<p>It was one of those lodging-houses known to the trouping
fraternity, where late hours and equally late rising were
understood; where you could cook things in your bed room and do
more or less as you pleased as long as your bill was paid.</p>

<p>Down-at-heel, but delightfully gay individuals conversed over
stair-rails in shirt-sleeves. The landlady wore slippers and a
cotton bath-robe. The blowsy old thing amused Jacqueline; and the
things she knew that Jacqueline did not know were like new
chapters, with colored illustrations, in the fascinating book of
life.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, I was as pretty as you are, and the same age,
when I began trouping; but the life soon wears you out. Running
this joint is restful compared to it, although you needn't kid
yourself the boys don't drive me crazy&mdash;and the girls are
worse! You take my tip and save your money. But, love you, we're
all the same way when we're young, and you'll not be guided by me!
All the same, you're pretty and I'm telling you; watch the men!
They're artful. They'll work you to death, and they'll spend all
you earn &mdash;not that I blame 'em if there's fools enough to
fall for it! Let's hope your head's screwed on right."</p>

<p>Consuelo gasped at that picture of the life, but Jacqueline
smiled at it, because it was different from anything she had ever
contemplated. It was all rather amusing, and vague, and intriguing;
not to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Ramon took her with him that very first afternoon down a grimy
back street to the back door of a café, and up to the stage to
watch him practise. Cervanez smoked cigarettes and pounded the
piano, and Jacqueline watched critically.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she could do as well as that&mdash;at any
rate with a little practise. And then it occurred to her there was
something pitiful in that man's need to dance like a marionette to
support his mother and Pepita&mdash;a thought that brought a blush
of shame with it. Did he work so hard for his money, and then lend
to herself and Consuelo! And how were they to repay him? Did he
always dance alone? No&mdash;she remembered he had danced in
Louisiana with Cervanez.</p>

<p>Cervanez herself answered that thought, by inviting Jacqueline
to play the piano for a while, so that she herself might practise
new steps with her son. But Jacqueline had taken music lessons at
the convent because they were compulsory, not because she had the
slightest natural gift in that direction, and though she made the
attempt it was worse than useless. Cervanez came and pushed her
almost roughly off the piano stool. Chagrin. Self-abasement. Ramon
noted it, and gallantly did what he could to put her at ease
again.</p>

<p>"There is something the senorita can do better than us all!" he
exclaimed, with one of his extravagant gestures. "Come,
Senorita&mdash;do me the favor &mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>He danced with her and the dancing did her good; it brought the
color to her cheeks, the light back into her eyes, and made her
glow all over healthfully.</p>

<p>Consuelo burst in on the scene after a while and protested
violently. But Ramon danced with her for two hours, until she could
almost have dropped from weariness. He seemed to take delight in
teaching her, making her do the same steps over and over again, and
sometimes pausing to gesticulate with both hands and lecture her:
"Senorita Conchita, permit me! You have left the convent! You are
not&mdash;no longer&mdash;any more afraid to show beautiful legs,
which may scandalize those who have taken the vows of religion, but
which the public adores! Faces are good, but legs are very good!"
He snapped his fingers. "Pep&mdash;zip&mdash;snap, Senorita! Now
again!"</p>

<p>But whenever he glanced at his mother she would light another
cigarette and nod. Consuelo sat dumb through it all, after lodging
her first protest. As she tried to describe it afterward, she felt
like a shepherd whose ewe-lamb has gone to the butcher.</p>

<p>"Honey dear, it's awful! They'll be asking you to dance in
public next!"</p>

<p>But it did not seem awful to Jacqueline, although her legs ached
and her head swam with fatigue. It was novelty, and she was doing
something. She rather reveled in the recklessness.</p>

<p>And Ramon was cute! He strolled home afterward like a troubadour
out of a story-book, flourishing a cigarette and throwing his
shoulders back, paying her extravagant compliments and boasting of
what they might do "poco tiempo" &mdash;soon&mdash;not very long,
Senorita. Dance with me, Senorita, and the crowd he burst the
walls! Then, you see! We go up, up, up! La Conchita becomes famous!
Ramon, he take back seat! For Conchita&mdash;diamonds, flowers,
limousine! For Ramon to salute her when she passes, hoping for just
one condescension from the beautiful blue eyes! A nod in
passing&mdash;no more! And Ramon will die happy!"</p>

<p>Evening with Consuelo was the worst part, for she locked the
bedroom door and kept all-comers at bay, lest the lodging-house
manners and views should defile her darling. Jacqueline wanted to
lie on the bed and stretch luxuriously, or talk with the frowzy old
landlady. But Consuelo would have none of that; she was as
frightened as a hen that has hatched one duckling and sees it take
to water. There was a wonderful fat man from the floor above, whose
pants were shiny at the knees, and who came in shirt-sleeves and
suspenders and sang songs to Consuelo through the key-hole, making
Jacqueline nearly die of giggling but arousing such wrath in
Consuelo that she finally stuck a hat-pin through the key-hole and
almost pierced the fat man's eye. He pretended she had blinded him,
and assured her he had one eye left, which was also at her
service.</p>

<p>She was so tired that she slept all night without dreaming; and
shortly after daybreak she had to get up to admit Pepita and her
monkey. The monkey got on the bed and nearly scared Consuelo out of
her senses, which would have been good fun if only Consuelo had not
been so angry and hysterical. She began to be very fond of Pepita,
and the monkey was a darling, with its hands in everything
including Consuelo's false hair.</p>

<p>Breakfast at eleven o'clock Jacqueline admitted was not so good.
The eggs tasted shop-worn, and there was still the blended smell of
cigars and cabbage from the day before. Nobody was at his best at
breakfast, and the fat man with the shiny black pants made
disagreeable noises with his teeth, which were false and did not
fit properly. The landlady was cross because some one had skipped
in the night without paying his bill. And the coffee, to quote the
fat man, tasted as if a crocodile had wept it. Even the canary in
its cage over by the window seemed melancholy, and the red-and-gray
parrot on a stand in the corner dropped his head and never said a
word.</p>

<p>However, breakfast did not last forever, and absorbing topics
followed it, that blew all drabness to the winds. Cervanez opened
fire, half- jealously:</p>

<p>"Ramon, he say you learn so good, he buy you costume if you
dance instead of me!"</p>

<p>"Then I should only be owing you more money," answered
Jacqueline.</p>

<p>What most surprised her was that Consuelo's prophecy should be
so soon fulfilled.</p>

<p>"What is a little more or less?" Cervanez retorted; but there
was a greedy glitter in her eye. "Ramon, he is lending you much
money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Senorita&mdash;my mother means&mdash;she is not so
young&mdash;not so very young and active. Rheumatism&mdash;now and
then it makes her a hard agony; yet she must dance. She
means&mdash;if now there were perhaps an understudy&mdash;a young
lady kind enough to take her place in case of sickness&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was watching those lake-blue eyes, but affecting not to. He
had hit the mark. He looked at her frankly at once and waved his
cigarette in the grand manner that dismissed real essentials as
trifles beneath consideration.</p>

<p>"And for an understudy there must be a costume&mdash;naturally.
If the senorita consents&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline could not refuse that. The request appealed to every
nerve of her generosity.</p>

<p>"If you think I could do it in a pinch&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so outdoors, into the roaring city, with her arm through
Ramon's;</p>

<p>"For in a sense we are partners now, Senorita. I am proud!"</p>

<p>Cervanez and Consuelo tagged along behind, Consuelo unprotesting
because she knew no protest would avail. They took a trolley to a
street where a costume shop was jammed between a pawnbroker's and a
second-hand clothier's. In the shop was a beady-eyed fat Jewess,
who seemed to know everybody in the world by the first name and to
want to talk about them all at once, while she looked at you and
registered impressions with a sixth sense. Presently, without so
much as being asked to do it, she brought out armfuls of elaborate
frocks, all of which Ramon sent back again unglanced at, with a
magnificent gesture of his left hand.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no possible chance of their getting together
on the prices, until suddenly Cervanez nudged Ramon and took
Jacqueline and Consuelo out of the shop. They looked in the
pawnbroker's window for about five minutes, when Ramon suddenly
emerged and it seemed to Jacqueline that he was suppressing a smile
of triumph. She supposed he had his own way. She caught him
exchanging a swift glance with Cervanez. Yet his first words
intimated that the guess was wrong.</p>

<p>"Senorita, it is well that I was present, or she would have
charged twice &mdash;three times as much. Bear me witness that I
did my utmost to reduce the cost. You begin to see now what
expenses there are in our profession. It is debt that makes us
dance! The cost of traveling&mdash;the price of pork and
beans&mdash;the extortions of a landlady&mdash;the unreasonable
price of costumes&mdash;the salary, so low that it becomes a weekly
insult &mdash;moreover, the fees to agents! It is well we dance!
Believe me, it is necessary! We dance one step, and no more, ahead
of the devil all the time!"</p>

<p>Ahead of the devil! She thought of Wahl instantly, and her face
clouded. Cervanez, who noticed everything, promptly improved on
Ramon's little sermon.</p>

<p>"Conchita, all these bills&mdash;they, mount up. You will be
owing us many hundred dollars."</p>

<p>She did not like to be called Conchita by Cervanez, but they had
agreed on that as the name she should be known by; and it was well
understood that nobody was to call her Jacqueline or as much as
drop hints about her past. But she liked still less the prospect of
being in debt to these people, and began to be troubled about it.
But, when she questioned Ramon or Cervanez they became vague, and
said it all depended; and the more vague they were, the more
miserable Consuelo grew.</p>

<p>Jacqueline was finding some sort of balance at last&mdash;at
least knew what she wished to forget, and what she would always
remember. She would never forget Desmio; but she would remember him
as he was when he gave her that locket with his portrait in it, and
told her there would some day be another man whom she would love.
She would always wear the locket next her heart. And she would
never forget Sherry Mansfield, although she must never see him
again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there was something in life after all. The title of
understudy gave her a thrill of pride. It felt almost like earning
your own living, and she was not quite such a burden to these
people as she had been. And so back to the practise on the shabby
El Toro stage.</p>

<p>It needed nothing but Ramon's critical coaching to turn
Jacqueline into a superb dancer. The convent had given her all the
grounding necessary. She had perfect command of her muscles, poise
and balance; all Ramon had to do was to subtract some elements of
super-modesty, and add what he called "pep-zip-snap" in place of
it.</p>

<p>Papa Pantopoulos, the owner of the café, in nobody's confidence
yet, but with an imagination of his own, sat at a table and began
to figure advertising space rates with a stub of pencil on the back
of yesterday's menu card. He presently went out to buy four more
secondhand tables.</p>

<p>Ramon was a dancer who improved incredibly if a partner inspired
him to it, and he liked to lavish praise, because it cost nothing
and yet made him feel generous. Jacqueline flourished under praise
like a flower in the rays of the sun; it did not turn her head, but
made her try harder than ever. And as it was Ramon's habit to fall
cavalierly in love with every pretty girl in sight, in or out of
turn, it was only a matter of hours before Jacqueline discovered a
new problem on her hands.</p>

<p>She talked it over that night with Consuelo, but received no
help of the sort she wanted. Consuelo's idea of how to keep a man
at bay was limited to boiling-water, hat-pins, and looking daggers
at him, with maybe some vinegary comment thrown in. So Jacqueline
had to work it out for herself, and lay awake long after midnight
puzzling over how to manage Consuelo too; for if Consuelo were to
grow too tart with Ramon and Cervanez there would soon be an
explosion, by which nobody would be the gainer.</p>

<p>She prayed long and earnestly. But it was Mother Eve who came to
her assistance&mdash;original feminine art and an inborn gift for
rising to occasions. She would flirt with Ramon. Why not? She would
let him hope all he cared to. Then, if Consuelo should grow too
quarrelsome, perhaps Ramon's ambition might help to keep him good
tempered.</p>

<p>Having reached which decision, Jacqueline slept in the same
undisturbed peace that doubtless once breathed o'er
Eden&mdash;calm, because she was quite sure that the Blessed Virgin
had heard her prayer and answered it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23">CHAPTER 23.</a><br>
"The Tribune be damned!"</h2>

<p class="first">The Tribune Building in San Francisco hummed to
the throb of the enormous presses. The news-room grew suddenly
quiet, and then noisy with voices, as it always did when an edition
had gone to press. Sherry Mansfield, back into routine a week ago
and looking as if he had never seen dirt or muddy water, stood in
the big window with both hands in his pockets, staring moodily at
the street. Dad Lawrence beckoned the city editor, and walked out
with him for coffee and cigarettes that were almost a part of the
daily ritual, in a dingy, smoky little café down a
side-street&mdash;a place where any one could find them in a hurry,
and where the entire staff often drifted in during the half-hour
between editions. Dad had almost reached the elevator, when John
Covert Mansfield's door opened with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Dad&mdash;I want you."</p>

<p>Dad strolled in with both hands in his pockets. Mansfield senior
resumed the seat at the desk, that he never vacated for a minute
longer than he could help, stuck an unlighted cigar in his mouth,
and looked up at Dad Lawrence with one of the peculiar dry grimaces
that implied dissatisfaction coupled with combativeness.</p>

<p>"Seen much of Sherry since he got back?" he asked.</p>

<p>"About as much as usual," Dad answered.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"He seems well."</p>

<p>Mansfield made a gesture of impatience. "I'd call in a doctor,
not you, if I thought he had a bellyache!" he answered. "Is he in
love, or something?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't said so to me."</p>

<p>"Find out, will you?"</p>

<p>"Why? Are you and he not hitting it?"</p>

<p>"No!" Mansfield answered, biting off the end of the cigar and
looking up at Dad again. "For the first time I don't know what he's
thinking about. He mopes and says nothing&mdash;work's all to hell,
too&mdash;look at that drivel!" He tossed some sheets of paper
across the desk. "Calls that trying his hand at editorials!"</p>

<p>"Any specific reason for supposing he's in love?" Dad inquired,
stroking his chin and eying Mansfield quizzically.</p>

<p>"What else would have made him act like a plain born fool?"
demanded Mansfield. "If he's in love, I'm going to know it, and
bring him to his senses before some woman ruins him. Wahl tells me
he suspects Sherry knows something about that Lanier girl&mdash;and
by the way, that's a corking good Sunday feature Wahl's made of
her. Have you seen it?"</p>

<p>"Wahl would suspect the Almighty," Dad answered. "Why don't you
ask Sherry himself?"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;twice. The boy's lying to me, and he never was a
liar before in all his life. Wahl says Sherry was missing two days,
and turned up in a launch with a girl, who disappeared a moment
afterward. He says Sherry's conduct that night was elusive, to put
it mildly. Wahl wanted to leave Sherry on the job to clean up that
story; he doesn't believe the Lanier girl was drowned, and they
haven't found her body. It's quite likely she's alive. Sherry gave
Wahl the slip, so Wahl found a man named Harris and left him in
charge. Now comes a letter from Harris complaining that a young man
named Mansfield locked him into a cabin, and adds that he suspects
this Mansfield of having aided the girl to escape. Mansfield is
unquestionably Sherry. Sherry pretends to know nothing at all about
it. Lie number one."</p>

<p>"Does sound fishy, doesn't it?" Dad agreed.</p>

<p>"Fishy as hell. Yesterday Sherry walked in and asked me for ten
days off."</p>

<p>"Did he give any reason?"</p>

<p>"No. Refused. So I refused the request. He got off some damfool
stuff about my having known him a number of years, and that it's
time I could trust him without an argument."</p>

<p>"Well, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Not if he's in love!"</p>

<p>Dad stroked his chin again, and worked his jaw as if he were
shaving.</p>

<p>"I think I'd trust Sherry anywhere," he answered. "But I tell
you, the boy's lying! I'll bet ten thousand dollars there's a woman
in it! I thought Wahl might do him good, but they don't hit it off;
he seems to hate Wahl. You're no constellation, Dad, but Sherry
likes you, and so do I. I'm going to turn him over to you for a
while. Trot him around with you to do the social stuff, and keep
your eyes peeled, but get this: I'm not asking you to run and tell
me tales about him."</p>

<p>"No, I guessed you knew better than that," Dad said quietly.</p>

<p>"Watch him and give him the right steer. Use your influence to
try to get him to tell me what's on his mind. I want it straight
from him. I want to feel he and I are friends again."</p>

<p>"Suppose he came and told you he's in love?" Dad suggested.</p>

<p>"There'd be a fight, of course. But I'd win! I'd hold him to his
promise to have no truck with women until he's thirty."</p>

<p>"Was that a promise that he made you definitely, with his eyes
wide open?" Dad asked.</p>

<p>"It was a stipulation I made. If he wanted to come on the
Tribune with me, that was the condition."</p>

<p>Dad wrinkled his mouth up and straightened it again. "Well, I'll
do my best," he answered. "Have you told Sherry?"</p>

<p>"No, you tell him. Take him in charge until you hear again from
me."</p>

<p>So Sherry came off the regular schedule, and roved with Dad all
over the city, covering odd assignments at odd hours, interviewing
hostesses, who liked to have their names in print, and attending
weary social functions interspersed with occasional plays and
road-house openings. Dad knew San Francisco as a dock rat knows the
water-front, and had reduced to a fine art the subdivision of a
crowded evening; knew where to stay longest, and where just to nose
in and disappear. But there were occasional functions where they
had to stay an hour or two, as at Mrs. Carstairs-Coningsby's, for
instance. As the wealthy American wife of an equally wealthy
Englishman, she felt it incumbent on her to know everybody and do
everything; there were always surprises at her house, and she knew
enough to spring them not too early in the evening.
"Dance&mdash;supper&mdash;tableaux vivants"* ran the invitation;
and Sherry and Dad attended, expecting to get "copy" out of it, but
also to be bored.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>tableau vivant</i> (French)&mdash;a scene
presented on stage by costumed actors who remain silent and
motionless as if in a picture. <i><a href=

Dictionary</a>.</i>]</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs-Coningsby made rather a fuss over Sherry; if not
a lion just yet, he was likely to be one some day. So she took him
in hand and introduced him right and left.</p>

<p>"His father owns the Tribune, Mr. Miro. Mr. Mansfield, surely
you've heard of John Miro?"</p>

<p>"I support his father's paper!" Miro answered, with a glittering
twinkle in his eyes. "Simply outrageous advertising rates! I
presume, Mr. Mansfield, you are one of the reporters I have been
hiding from."</p>

<p>"Haven't you Louisiana relatives?" Sherry asked him.</p>

<p>The smile remained, but the eyes grew subtly softer.</p>

<p>"Did you know Andres?" he countered. "Did you know his protegée,
Miss Lanier?"</p>

<p>Sherry's jaw set tight. It was an utterly unconscious change of
expression, and the older man diagnosed it instantly. It could only
have one of two possible meanings, either of which included the
fact that Sherry was on guard.</p>

<p>"You believe she was all that the papers said, or you don't.
Which is it?" Miro asked.</p>

<p>"I don't," said Sherry, looking combative.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," Miro answered, smiling. "That's why I've refused
to be interviewed about her. Have you time to talk with me?"</p>

<p>Sherry almost gasped. John Miro had, and enjoyed hugely, the
reputation of being hard to corner. His advertisements blazed on
night horizons from border to border, and coast to coast: every
newspaper of importance heralded his "MIRACULOUS RUBBERS" in big
black type; but he had never been interviewed. It was even rumored
that he cultivated aloofness and a sort of mystery for its
publicity value.</p>

<p>Miro glanced swiftly around the packed reception room and led
the way to a lounge under a flight of stairs, offered Sherry a
cigar, and lolled back against embroidered cushions without seeming
to lose one atom of his subtle alertness.</p>

<p>Sherry in the corner faced him, with a feeling that his inmost
thoughts were all going to be laid bare unless he watched himself.
He bit off the end of the cigar with a vicious snap, and Miro
smiled.</p>

<p>"So you knew Andres?"</p>

<p>"No, but I was covering the Mississippi floods, when Calhoun
killed him."</p>

<p>"Did you write that stuff that appeared in the Tribune?"</p>

<p>"I did not!"</p>

<p>"No, I imagine you wouldn't. It was the most malignant fabric of
lies I have ever seen," said Miro; but he was smiling as pleasantly
as ever. The glitter in his eyes was not perceptible to Sherry,
because of the shadow cast by the stairs. "The worst part of the
tragedy was the cruelty to little Jacqueline. I only knew her as a
small girl&mdash;all legs and long hair, eight, or perhaps nine
years old when I last saw her. Her character was hardly formed, of
course, but as I live, and must some day face my Maker, she was
incapable of growing into anything but a sweet&mdash;a
noble&mdash;a pure woman. In addition she had the enormous
advantage over other girls of constant association with my cousin
Andres."</p>

<p>"I was told that you and he were enemies," said Sherry.</p>

<p>"Hah! I admired him. I may say I loved him. He chose to quarrel
with me because, when I began my national advertising, I used the
family name instead of some imaginary one. When I heard he was to
marry little Jacqueline I realized at once that he simply intended
to make her his legal heir, and to prevent me from inheriting
anything under the Miro trust deed. I admired him for it, and sent
him a telegram, which he saw fit not to answer. He was a splendid
fellow and his death grieved me more than I can tell you. However,
we can endure grief. It is anger that insists on remedy. I am still
enraged in every fiber of my being by the fate of poor
Jacqueline."</p>

<p>He did not look enraged. His attitude suggested anything but
that, and Sherry's sensation was almost that of being played with,
yet not quite; there was a sort of vague tenseness.</p>

<p>"You are wondering," said Miro, "why I make you these
confidences. I will give you the answer. You are the only
individual I have met who does not believe what the newspapers say
about Jacqueline. And that is all the more interesting, because you
yourself are a newspaper man."</p>

<p>Sherry said nothing, but got up and stood where he could see
Miro's face. He felt torn four ways at once, and meant to be sure
of his ground before he trusted any one. He did not even know that
he really knew Jacqueline. He knew he loved a girl, who might be,
and probably was Jacqueline, that was all. This man might be an
ally&mdash;or might be a very formidable enemy.</p>

<p>"Sit down again," suggested Miro pleasantly. "I propose to win
your confidence. I don't believe Jacqueline was drowned."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Sherry demanded.</p>

<p>"For one reason, because you don't appear to believe it. I
suspect you of knowing something. For another, because they have
not found her body, although I paid fifty men for a week to search
for it, and they found neither Jacqueline nor her
nurse.&mdash;Every&mdash;other&mdash;person&mdash; lost&mdash;in
that flood&mdash;has been accounted for. A third reason is, that I
think the natural impulse of a nice girl, raised in a convent, and
suddenly plunged into a cruel scandal, would be to run away and
hide. In addition to all that, I have a clue."</p>

<p>"Did you visit the scene yourself?" asked Sherry.</p>

<p>"I did. I received a telegram from Isabella Miro&mdash;Andres'
sister &mdash;so peculiarly worded that I took the next train. Of
course I would have attended the funeral in any case. Isabella
looked to me like a very sick woman, but she was dressed to receive
me in the patio; and the air of conspiracy with which she greeted
me&mdash;the obvious delight she took in being rid of
Jacqueline&mdash;the malice she betrayed&mdash;and the things that
she said to me about Jacqueline's character, all pointed to one
conclusion. I suspect insanity. That is a woman poisoned by
in-growing spleen. That is what might happen to any Miro,
unless&mdash;as in my case &mdash;some new outlet were discovered
for the racial pride, which is as inseparable from us as our
breath. I said things to Donna Isabella, which I now rather regret.
Truth is not good physic for the insane. She found my remarks
unpalatable, and, I regret to learn, took to her bed. But what she
said in reply convinced me that any proud and innocent young girl
placed in Jacqueline's position would have run away, as Jacqueline
in fact did. And if she had brains, as I understand Jacqueline had,
she might easily take advantage of the flood to disappear entirely.
Do you follow me thus far?"</p>

<p>Sherry nodded.</p>

<p>"I determined to find her," Miro continued, smoking away quietly
as if determination with him entailed neither excitement nor
exercise. "But I realized that it would be a mistake to advertise
for her through the usual channels because, if you will pardon the
expression, your damned newspaper, and others, would seize on that
to excuse further scurrilous publicity. I have considered the big
detective agencies.&mdash;Have you?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Sherry frowned.</p>

<p>"Exactly? We are agreed again," said Miro, smiling. "Now be kind
enough to tell me what you know." Sherry described his flood
experience in fifty words. "And if she's the same girl, she's in
San Francisco," he ended abruptly.</p>

<p>"What makes you imagine that?"</p>

<p>Sherry pulled an envelope from his pocket, showed a scrap of
lace, and a piece of ribbon with several strands of long dark hair
knotted into it, and told of his inquiries at the railroad
station.</p>

<p>"She's with two Dagos, a fat woman, who's probably Consuelo
Martinez, a kid of some sort, and an organ-grinder's monkey!"</p>

<p>"Consuelo Martinez," Miro said slowly, but his eyes were
glittering again, "is Jacqueline's old nurse. I had her name from
Isabella Miro. There is no doubt left in my mind that the little
girl you spent two days with in a barn, and my little friend
Jacqueline are one and the same."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you're her friend?" asked Sherry.</p>

<p>Miro smiled broadly. "Pardon me, it is still my turn to ask for
confidence. You have not yet told me all you know."</p>

<p>"Yes I have," said Sherry.</p>

<p>"By inference, perhaps. I invite you to be frank. What is your
motive for finding her?"</p>

<p>"I love her," Sherry answered promptly.</p>

<p>"Permit me to admire your good taste. Are you aware that she has
no money?"</p>

<p>"Don't know anything about her affairs," Sherry answered with
his jaw set rather tight again.</p>

<p>"Your father, is&mdash;ah&mdash;in your confidence?"</p>

<p>"Not he. I've lied to him."</p>

<p>"And if he should learn?"</p>

<p>"There would be one Hades of a row!"</p>

<p>"You are willing to face that? Have you money of your own?"</p>

<p>"Only my salary."</p>

<p>Miro smiled, and Sherry noticed it. "And you know that she has
none."</p>

<p>"Never even stopped to consider that," said Sherry.</p>

<p>"You also understand how extremely difficult it will be to
disprove these newspaper charges against her?"</p>

<p>Sherry nodded. Miro continued to smile, and for several minutes
they faced each other in silence, Sherry growing more and more
uneasy. He wondered whether he was not beginning to be able to see
through the man's mask, perhaps because the other so intended.</p>

<p>"On what grounds do you base your belief in her innocence?"
asked Miro.</p>

<p>"It's not a question of belief. I'm damned well sure of it,"
said Sherry.</p>

<p>"Love's unreason, eh? I propose we carry on the search for her
together. Such enthusiasm&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sherry frowned again. All sorts of forebodings occurred to him,
but he said nothing.</p>

<p>"I think I understand you perfectly," said Miro, watching his
face. "And you are quite right. If she is hiding, we have no right
whatever to force her into the limelight, with the inevitable
consequences. The difficulty will be to avoid further publicity. I
suppose, if you find her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Tribune be damned!" answered Sherry.</p>

<p>Miro nodded. "In my business I would fire a man who entertained
any such sentiment. However, you are quite right, although it does
not always pay to be right. For your sake I propose that we carry
on the search independently. You do your best to keep reporters off
the trail. I defray expenses. How does that suit you?"</p>

<p>Sherry looked sullen&mdash;jealous, suspicious. Miro seemed
amused. As a bachelor he understood the reason perfectly.</p>

<p>"I have a few men in my organization on whom I can thoroughly
depend," he said. "I have already turned them loose on San
Francisco."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," said Sherry, "the Tribune's going to run a brute of
a Sunday special about her, and I can't stop it&mdash;daren't even
try. If I said a word they'd be on to the fact that I know she's
alive. They suspect me already."</p>

<p>"Say nothing then."</p>

<p>"It's a rotten job. That beast Wahl did it&mdash;the same who
wrote the first story. I'm the fool who recommended him to the
Tribune! If she ever sees it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sunday, eh? Five days from now. We might find her in five
days," said Miro. "Poor Jacqueline! My cousin Andres undoubtedly
taught her to be more sensitive than you or I would be to anything
of that kind. Well&mdash;are we agreed?"</p>

<p>Sherry nodded, but ungraciously. He felt he had told Miro much
more than he should have done. For all he knew to the contrary
marrying young girls might be an hereditary predisposition with
middle-aged Miros! "Millions maketh manners." His own father was a
case in point. There would be no controlling Miro&mdash;no possible
check on him. However, he forced a smile; for it occurred to him
that, though Miro might spirit Jacqueline away, and even persuade
her to marry him to escape from her predicament, that would be
better for her than not to be found at all.</p>

<p>Miro understood his attitude, and rather liked him for it. Used
to being flattered and toadied to, he enjoyed this irreverence and
recognized the good stuff underneath. He stood up and offered his
hand.</p>

<p>"I see I'm not in the same boat with little Jacqueline," he
said, smiling. "You won't accept me at face value, eh? If you find
yourself in difficulties, try me&mdash;and call on me for money if
you need it. You know my address? Let's see&mdash;what shall I
have? A headache will do, I think. If you see our hostess, please
assure her that my temporary indisposition is not due to her
sandwiches, because I didn't eat any. Good night."</p>

<p>Miro went for his coat, and Sherry found Dad by going straight
toward the sandwiches and champagne.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here," he urged, and Dad, having made a good
supper, needed no extra persuasion. Out on the sidewalk he took
Sherry's arm.</p>

<p>"Noticed you with Miro," he said. "Get a story?"</p>

<p>"No," Sherry answered brown-studying. "He did."</p>

<p>"Don't you know he's cousin to the Andres Miro, who was killed
in Louisiana?" Dad demanded. "You young bone-head! I felt sure you
were getting a column out of him. Man&mdash;he's front-page stuff!
Didn't you talk to him about the Lanier girl?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing for publication."</p>

<p>Dad looked keenly at him in the light of a street lamp. He was
deadly curious; but he decided that questioning might only drive
Sherry more into himself.</p>

<p>"If you've something on your mind, why don't you tell your
father?" he asked, putting a hand on Sherry's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Because he'd kick like hell!" Sherry answered, not exactly
shaking off the hand, but widening the space between them. "I don't
want to have to fight him&mdash;or you either. See?"</p>

<p>Dad whistled softly. He was still whistling when they boarded a
car. He whistled all the way back to the Tribune office, and there
were lots of flat notes, and several sharp ones. It was nothing
that even resembled a hopeful or contented tune.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24">CHAPTER 24.</a><br>
"Young nicee girlee&mdash;catchee lich man!"</h2>

<p class="first">It was a Sunday morning when Jacqueline was forced
at last to stand and face destiny. You may make your bed in hell,
as the Psalmist proposed, or in a cheap boarding-house, which is
less intriguing, but problems follow you.</p>

<p>The moulting parrot watched the breakfast table with a
melancholy eye, and the fat man from upstairs made the usual
remarks about the food. Nine or ten people were buried behind the
rustling sheets of the Sunday paper, and Jacqueline found nothing
to do but stare at back-page advertisements and wonder why the
underworld, as Consuelo insisted upon calling it, preferred
breakfast in slippers and curl-papers. She had come to hate the
sight of newspapers; their rustling made her nervous.</p>

<p>Even Cervanez, careful about appearances as a rule, because she
gloried in being mistaken for Ramon's wife, came down untidy and
sour&mdash;prodded fried eggs with a fork&mdash;sipped the
coffee&mdash;swore in English &mdash;snatched at the magazine
section of Ramon's paper, and up-ended it against the cruet. There
was no conversation. The fat man declared he had found a beetle in
the prune-juice, and made remarks about it; but that was a
monologue. Nobody cared.</p>

<p>Even the monologue had ceased, and there was nothing but the
yawping of an incredulously opportunist cat to relieve monotony,
when Jacqueline became uncomfortably conscious of Cervanez' eyes
staring at her over the top of the newspaper. She had never before
seen quite that stony look on Cervanez' face. It was no longer
calculating; it had calculated&mdash;no mistaking that.</p>

<p>Jacqueline forced a smile, but Cervanez said nothing, which only
made it worse. She nudged Ramon, and made him read the part of the
newspaper that was propped open in front of her. Ramon, reading
slowly, glanced up too, but with different expression. His eyes
hinted that new calculations were beginning. Jacqueline felt the
goose-flesh rising, and that ghastly sick sensation that
accompanies vague fear. But she tried to pretend to herself that it
was the breakfast odors that made her feel faint, and gave that
excuse to Consuelo as she left the room.</p>

<p>Consuelo followed her upstairs and found her trembling on the
bed.</p>

<p>"Consuelo, I can't stand this place a minute longer! Oh, why
haven't we some money?"</p>

<p>"We've a little, honey. Look,&mdash;eleven dollars."</p>

<p>"Where did you get it, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>Consuelo hesitated. It is never quite easy to dissemble in the
face of innocence.</p>

<p>"You didn't steal it, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>The frown danced furiously, and the lake-blue eyes looked
horrified.</p>

<p>"Conchita! How could you think that?" (Consuelo bit her lip,
though.) "I found a friend this morning, while you were asleep, and
borrowed."</p>

<p>But Jacqueline was nervous, horror trod on horror's heels that
morning. "She knows who you are, then. She'll tell! They'll
discover me! Consuelo, we must run!"</p>

<p>"Honey, we'll go this very minute! I'd as soon die as see you
stay in this place!"</p>

<p>Panic overwhelmed both of them. They felt like frightened
animals who ran without rhyme or reason, and began packing, each in
the other's way,&mdash; throwing their few belongings into a cheap
straw valise. Neither of them heard the door open until Cervanez
coughed. Then they faced about like detected criminals, and
Consuelo, feeling cornered, flared up:</p>

<p>"We're going!"</p>

<p>"Going where?" asked Cervanez harshly, standing with one hand on
her hip and her back to the door.</p>

<p>"Never mind where. We're going. You and your cheap restaurants
and public dancing!"</p>

<p>Cervanez glared angrily, flourishing the Sunday paper like a
weapon in front of her.</p>

<p>"And that money what you owe us&mdash;me and Ramon?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"We'll pay when we can," said Consuelo, standing her ground.</p>

<p>"When you can?" Cervanez screamed. "Can! Can! You make us fools!
Look! Read!" She shook the paper in their faces. "It say you have
no money&mdash; never! You not marry Miro&mdash;you get
nothing&mdash;nix&mdash;an' you know that all along! Now you see
paper and you run away! I call police! I show you! Who pay back all
that money to me an' Ramon?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline shrank away, the New Orleans paper in mind. It did
not occur to her that any other paper might be repeating the story.
But Consuelo fought back:</p>

<p>"You won't tell how much we owe!" she retorted.</p>

<p>"How much? How much you pay me?" Cervanez screamed, and the
noise of that brought Ramon, suave and imperturbable as ever.
Cervanez moved away from the door to let him through, and he stood
surveying the scene with the air of a toreador. There was triumph
in his eye&mdash;a firm smile on his lips. He was magnificent.</p>

<p>"Ramon, they run! They get no money! They desert us!" Cervanez
exclaimed tragically.</p>

<p>Ramon nodded comprehension. Nevertheless, he retained the air of
gallantry and faced the bedroom like a lord of the arena. Poor
Jacqueline shrank farther back than ever. To her his triumphant
smile meant only one thing, he would betray who she was and revel
in her public shame!</p>

<p>"Deus!" he said, smiling. "There is more money in Conchita's
feet than in a mine of Minos Gaeres! She will dance. Is it not so,
Senorita?"</p>

<p>Cervanez looked incredulous, and the tortoise-shell comb, that
propped her black hair in a high pile, trembled with indignation,
but she was no more angry than Consuelo. Consuelo stamped her foot,
anger rising, as the other woman's fell, like fluid passing from
one to the other.</p>

<p>"She shall not dance! She shall not be at your service! She, who
is fit to be a queen, and you who are&mdash;pah!&mdash;underworld!
I will take her away! I will work my hands to the bone for her! She
shall not dance!"</p>

<p>But she reckoned without Jacqueline, whose eyes were on Ramon's.
Seventeen is the midway point between youth and maturity. Childish
fears and innocence persist, but riper judgment dawns, and the one
gives place to the other alternately.</p>

<p>Pride is a constant equation, always to be reckoned with. There
are limits beyond which inborn pride can not be pressed by
fear.</p>

<p>Jacqueline stepped toward Ramon. Consuelo strode between them,
trying to keep Jacqueline behind her. Ramon smiled, and signaled
with one eloquent eyebrow to his mother to be still. Jacqueline
avoided Consuelo's outstretched arm.</p>

<p>"I will speak to him, Consuelo."</p>

<p>Ramon bowed with sufficient dignity to cover up the hint of
mockery in his handsome eyes, and Consuelo yielded faute de mieux,*
ready, though, to slap Ramon's face at the first excuse.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>faute de mieux</i> (French)&mdash;for
lack of a better option.]</p>

<p>"Senor Ramon, if I refuse to dance for you, will you tell who I
am?"</p>

<p>Cervanez was about to answer, but Ramon checked her, smiling his
handsomest. The swift, revengeful Latin flash that lit up his
mother's eyes found no reflection in his. He was too good an actor.
He could carry off a situation to the last bluff&mdash;until the
last bet. His elbow, sticking out jauntily from his side as if a
mantilla were draped on it, signaled to his mother to leave this
play to him. He knew Jacqueline was not bluffing; nobody could fail
to recognize the honesty in those blue eyes. He met dignity with
dignity and honesty with something that at least held up a mirror
to it.</p>

<p>"Senorita Conchita, I would tear out this heart with my hands
before I would betray you! When I said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Am I free to go?"</p>

<p>"Si, Senorita La Conchita is as free as she is adorable! My
mother and I are happy to have been of service. That
bagatelle&mdash;the insignificant sums we have
advanced&mdash;accept them, Senorita, as our gift&mdash;and our
apologies that we had no more to give!"</p>

<p>But Jacqueline could see his mother's face behind him and the
malice in that pair of black eyes steeled her. Pride chilled the
steel. She was willing to face anything that minute&mdash;even
exposure&mdash;even Wahl, and mock heroics stirred her true
heroism.</p>

<p>"If I go, you will tell no one my real name?"</p>

<p>"Never, Senorita!"</p>

<p>Cervanez gasped, but Ramon smiled steadily. He enjoyed the
drama. He foresaw victory, and he was right.</p>

<p>"Then I will dance for you!" said Jacqueline.</p>

<p>Ramon betrayed then that his gold was tinsel; he turned his head
swiftly to exchange a boastful smirk of triumph with his mother.
But Jacqueline did not see that; she had Consuelo on her hands.</p>

<p>"No, no, honey! Never! You shall not! I will not have it! You
shall not dance in public!"</p>

<p>But the bird had flown the nest. The child was no longer in a
nurse's keeping. Pride, breeding, courage, all had charge.</p>

<p>"Consuelo, we can't owe these people money. We must repay them,
and there isn't any other way."</p>

<p>"Hundreds and hundreds of dollars!" Cervanez interjected.</p>

<p>Consuelo flared up again at that.</p>

<p>"You give us no accounting! You won't say how much we owe! You!
Do you expect us to work for you for ever?"</p>

<p>Ramon faced about swiftly, his eyes blazing. He motioned to his
mother to leave the room. He did not propose to have victory
spoiled by a fresh exchange of incivilities and Cervanez knew
better than to disobey. But she turned on him outside the bedroom
door.</p>

<p>"You, Ramon, you take such a hazard! You are mad!" Ramon put his
arm around Cervanez' waist and kissed her, as if she were his
sweetheart.</p>

<p>"We could sell her to the newspaper for more than she owes us!"
he answered, smiling. "But why show the trump, when you can win
with the low card?"</p>

<p>"You! Ramon! Oh, you clever rogue! But she must begin to dance.
We are in debt. We run risks, Ramon. And we run greater risks if
any one recognizes her, because then she will surely run away!"</p>

<p>He motioned Cervanez to her own room, knocked on Jacqueline's
door again and entered. Consuelo stormed and ordered him out, but
he appealed over her shoulder to Jacqueline with one of those
cavalier gestures that graced every situation in which he found
himself. He was like a toreador apologizing whimsically to the
audience for the clumsiness of the bull. It made Jacqueline
smile.</p>

<p>"Have you come to issue your commands?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Never, Senorita!" He bowed with his hand on his heart. "I am a
suppliant!"</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"For forgiveness."</p>

<p>Jacqueline blushed.</p>

<p>"Circumstances are relentless, Senorita."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Ramon?"</p>

<p>"We are broke, Senorita!"</p>

<p>She knew well enough what that word meant, although she never
associated it in her own thoughts with her own condition. She
thought only of Ramon, and that instantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ramon! Consuelo&mdash;Consuelo has a friend who lends her
money. Borrow some for Ramon, Consuelo!"</p>

<p>Never had Ramon so enjoyed a situation! No phase of it was lost
on him &mdash;humor&mdash;pathos&mdash;irony&mdash;he saw it all.
He even knew who Consuelo's friend was.</p>

<p>"Senorita, you overwhelm me! But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" asked Jacqueline. "Surely you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am truly embarrassed by your loyal generosity. But"&mdash;he
smiled proudly&mdash;"you who are so proud will understand. And
there is another way. Senorita&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid. Tell me."</p>

<p>Consuelo, watching from the bed, guessed how little fear he
felt, but that did not prevent Ramon from acting self-abasement
perfectly.</p>

<p>"That Greek, Senorita, who owns the café, would gladly pay us to
begin dancing tomorrow, instead of next week. For me alone he
offers little, but for the two of us&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused as if frightened at his own boldness.</p>

<p>"You mean that you depend on me?" asked Jacqueline.</p>

<p>Ramon gestured away the scandalous notion of imposing on
her.</p>

<p>"Deus! That would be unforgivable! But, if the senorita wishes
to repay us &mdash;and it is convenient&mdash;then let the Greek
serve his purpose! Why not? If the senorita should dance in a mask,
none would ever recognize her, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Conchita! Tell him you will not!" urged Consuelo.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ramon, I will begin tomorrow night," Jacqueline said
quietly. She was disappointed in Consuelo. To have a convenient
friend who lent money, and not to be willing to borrow to help
people to whom one was under obligation, was not praiseworthy. She
signified with a little regal nod that Ramon had her leave to go,
and when he had bowed himself out she turned to deal with the old
duenna as a responsibility rather than an asset. Poor Consuelo,
recognizing disdain in the beloved blue eyes, tried very hard to
smile.</p>

<p>"You should have offered Ramon those eleven dollars that you
borrowed, Consuelo."</p>

<p>"Honey dear!" But Consuelo could not argue&mdash;could not
speak. She covered her face with her red, rough hands and wept into
them.</p>

<p>"Come now, don't cry, Consuelo. Why are your hands so red? Why
are you crying? There, there, never mind! You've had a dreadful
time, haven't you? And it's not so easy for you as it is for me,
because I'm young. But you've always been so loyal and generous to
me that I was surprised when you didn't offer that money to Ramon.
He's been good to us."</p>

<p>Consuelo dried her tears, pulled out a cheap apron she had
packed into the straw valise, and began to tie it on. Her face
became resigned&mdash;yet not without a sort of meek
determination.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere special, honey. Just downstairs. I promised&mdash;I
promised &mdash;I'd talk with the landlady. I'll be back soon. Lie
down, dear, and take a nap."</p>

<p>A nap was Consuelo's perennial recipe for all complaints, or for
none, she never having quite forgotten Jacqueline as a baby in
arms; and much the easiest way to avoid argument was to pretend to
comply, so Jacqueline lay down and Consuelo went downstairs to have
her gossip. But Consuelo was gone a long time, and Jacqueline with
nothing else to do, lay on the bed awake, considering things.</p>

<p>For one thing she wondered why Cervanez had only just discovered
that she would not inherit money. Had she kept that New Orleans
paper all this time and not read it until now? People were funny.
She did not mind dancing with Ramon&mdash;if that were a way of
getting out of debt. It is only pretentious ill-breeding that
resents inferiority. Real breeding is self-reliant, and it was much
less distressing to Jacqueline to associate with Ramon and
Cervanez&mdash;and with Pepita and a monkey&mdash;than it was for
Consuelo, who scorned the little Brazilian orphan as sincerely as
she loathed the performing animal (whereas Jacqueline made pets of
them both).</p>

<p>Anything was better than to worry about the disastrous past.
Desmio's death haunted her, and the thought of Sherry Mansfield
filled her with hopeless yearning, whenever she dared to think; and
she could not think of the days before that&mdash;not even of
Sister Michaela&mdash;without passing, as it were, through the neck
of a bottle, re-living dreadful seconds in Desmio's house, with two
dead bodies on the floor, and Wahl's hand on her
wrist&mdash;seconds that made her feel like going mad. One thing,
though, was possible. She could open the gold locket, and see
Desmio's face as he was when he gave her that last wedding-gift,
without letting her mind move forward to the tragedy.</p>

<p>She was looking at Desmio's portrait, wondering what he would
think of her dancing in public, and rather sure he would approve of
her earning her own living in the only way she could when Ramon
knocked at the door again. There was no mistaking his knock. She
made up her mind on the instant not to admit him.</p>

<p>So she opened the door six inches, and set her toe against it.
Ramon thrust his handsome face into the gap.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she asked, trying to make her voice sound
unafraid. Her education had not included the art of holding a
bedroom door against an amorous Brazilian.</p>

<p>"You, Conchita! Loveliest lady&mdash;you! Let me in!" Ramon
began to use pressure and set his foot into the opening. She could
not force the door shut again. She tried with all her might and
lost ground inch by inch. "Go away or I'll scream!"</p>

<p>He laughed. He knew that house, and knew where Consuelo was. A
woman would have to scream uncommonly loud and desperately before
any one would think twice about it. Women in Ramon's experience,
and especially young ones, like gallantry with a touch of force in
it&mdash;the velvet glove and iron hand. He shoved his hardest and
Jacqueline resolved to face him on her own ground. She jumped back
suddenly letting him stagger into the room, which was not very
dignified, and rather disconcerted him.</p>

<p>He tried to seize her hand and kiss it, but she snatched it
away, not yielding another inch of ground.</p>

<p>"Conchita, I love you! I adore you!" he said, laying one hand on
his heart. "Make me the happiest of men."</p>

<p>"I won't dance with you at all unless you're sensible."</p>

<p>"Adorable one, let us dance through life together!" Ramon urged.
"Dance until you have limousines and diamonds&mdash;until the past
is an empty dream, and the future, an assured fame! There is
nothing in all the universe that those blue eyes and twinkling feet
can not attain in partnership with me!"</p>

<p>He paused, not for lack of breath, or for words, but because she
was laughing at him. Try how she might (and she was not trying very
hard) she could not take Ramon seriously.</p>

<p>"If you behave yourself, I will dance with you until my debt is
paid off," she answered. "Otherwise&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not have managed him better. Unwittingly she had
touched the stop that made him abject. Avarice was stronger than
desire. But even so he tried to beat a retreat with dignity.</p>

<p>"Adorable Conchita, I am Ramon Braganza Manoel. It is love for
you, not for myself that makes this heart burn! I am unselfish!
Test me! Possibly you have not known me long enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>A cough at the door checked him suddenly. Cervanez entered,
wearing that look of much too utter innocence that is more
unconvincing than a stammered lie.</p>

<p>"Do you not mean to rehearse?" she asked.</p>

<p>That suited Jacqueline. She nodded. Cervanez took Ramon's arm,
but he did not seem to want an interview with his mother at that
moment.</p>

<p>"Let us escort Conchita to the stage," he said with one of his
superb bows.</p>

<p>"No, I'll join you there," Jacqueline answered. Without
analyzing, she was conscious of the upper hand over Ramon, and the
natural instinct of self- preservation warned her that she might
lose it unless she were careful. So she would take Consuelo with
her, and encourage Ramon just sufficiently from within the
protecting range of Consuelo's vision.</p>

<p>Ramon's mother led him from the room, and turned on him like a
tigress the second the door was closed behind them.</p>

<p>"Lucky for you I interrupt, Ramon!"</p>

<p>"You listen at key-holes!" he retorted angrily.</p>

<p>"Yes! And I hear madness! One more minute and you promise that
girl everything! She make damfool of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jacqueline listened until their voices died away on the lower
stairs, and then went in search of Consuelo.</p>

<p>"Consuelo!" she called down the back stairs that led to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>But there was no answer. There was a green baize door down
there, intended to shut off the kitchen noises from the rest of the
house. She would have to go down the back stairs and open that door
before she could make Consuelo hear.</p>

<p>She went down gingerly, never having visited that part of the
house before and feeling rather like a trespasser and anxious not
to be heard or seen. The green door swung quietly on a hinge that
worked both ways, and she pushed it open without making the least
noise. Inside there was a long twilight passage, and a sound of
something moving steadily&mdash;then of something knocking against
a tin pail; and there was a smell quite unmistakable. She let the
door swing shut behind her, and it was about a minute before her
eyes grew used to the dimness.</p>

<p>"Consuelo!" she called in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, honey! Yes! What is it?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were talking to the landlady." Consuelo, who was
kneeling, struggled to her feet&mdash;threw a scrubbing brush into
the bucket&mdash; wiped her hands&mdash;and tried to untie the wet
apron; but her soap-and-hot-water-soaked fingers could not manage
the knot. "What have you been doing, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>"Scrubbing, honey."</p>

<p>The tone was apologetic and ashamed.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the landlady was worried, and the scrubwoman didn't turn
up, so I thought I'd help her out."</p>

<p>"Why, Consuelo&mdash;you've scrubbed all this long
passage&mdash;and the walls&mdash;they're still wet."</p>

<p>"It was nothing, honey&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're all tired out! Have you ever done this before? Is this
what made you so tired the other day&mdash;and what has made your
hands so rough and red ever since the day after we came here?
Consuelo&mdash;tell me the truth at once! Is this how you got those
eleven dollars? Is this the friend you borrowed from?"</p>

<p>"Honey dear&mdash;we&mdash;we had to get some money somewhere.
I've lost my bank-book, you know that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And this is how you've been buying me candy and
hair-ribbons?"</p>

<p>"Conchita, dear, don't scold me!"</p>

<p>"And I asked you if you stole the money! Consuelo, give me that
scrubbing- brush at once! Go upstairs and wait for me!" She spoke
quickly to cover a sudden choke in her throat.</p>

<p>"No, honey."</p>

<p>"Consuelo&mdash;I tell you I will do it! Do you hear me? Is this
the board you kneel on? Give me your apron then."</p>

<p>Jacqueline undid the knot, and tied the wet apron on
herself.</p>

<p>"Honey, dear, you can't! You don't know how!"</p>

<p>"I will! Go upstairs and lie down, Consuelo! Kiss me
first&mdash;you dear! You dear old faithful! Now&mdash;you have
your orders! Be off with you, and rest!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline was on her knees already, dipping soft hands into the
lye.</p>

<p>"Please, honey!"</p>

<p>"Go and rest. Then put your hat on. You're to watch me
rehearse."</p>

<p>Consuelo obeyed. There was nothing else for it; and Jacqueline
splashed water on the floor&mdash;and scrubbed, and
scrubbed&mdash;using both hands to the brush, and wondering however
Consuelo had found strength for the task."</p>

<p>The Chinese cook came out through the kitchen door, and stood
still, watching her. She worked all the harder, wishing her arms
would not ache so. She was not going to rest while he looked at
her&mdash;not going to have to make excuses to a Chinaman. Why
didn't he go away?</p>

<p>Scrub-scrub-scrub&mdash;and how her arms ached! The Chinaman lit
the gas, and watched her steadily, until she felt she would like to
throw the brush at him.</p>

<p>"You no sabe," he said at last in a perfectly matter-of-fact
voice.</p>

<p>She stopped scrubbing then, and looked up at him. He had a
wrinkled old face, and bright eyes that looked older than the
world. He was not smiling, not scowling; he simply looked at
her.</p>

<p>"You no sabe sclubbe," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Any one can do this."</p>

<p>She resumed the scrubbing, but he took the pail away from her
and set it down on the far side of the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"No can do," he announced simply, and stood and watched her
again. He seemed to be a Napoleonic sort of Chinaman. She got to
her feet and he took the board away.</p>

<p>"Bring those back!" Jacqueline commanded. "I must finish or the
landlady will find fault."</p>

<p>"Belong my pidgen," he answered. "Landlady come back
bime-by&mdash;to- mollow maybe."</p>

<p>"But she must be here! She paid Consuelo to do this."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Consuelo said so."</p>

<p>"All same tellee lie. Belong my pidgen. Me pay Consuelo 'leben
dollars. This floor, dollar time. Kitchen floor, dollar-fifty time.
You sabe?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline did "sabe." Consuelo had been working for a Chinaman!
She blushed up to her ears, and was more glad than ever that she
had insisted on relieving her. She would finish the job now to the
bitter end!</p>

<p>"Bring that pail back here!" she commanded.</p>

<p>The Chinaman did not even move&mdash;did not frown&mdash;did not
smile &mdash;just looked at her.</p>

<p>"No can do," he answered her in his own good time. "You young
nice girlee. This old woman job. Consuelo can
do&mdash;dollar&mdash;dollar-fifty &mdash;catchee little, not much.
Consuelo getting no bime-by. All finish up. Dead soon. You plenty
bime-by. You plitee girlee-catchee lich man. Catchee
Consuelo&mdash;make sclub. You sabe?"</p>

<p>He was impregnable, entrenched in a philosophy totally foreign
to Jacqueline's comprehension. She did not know how to answer him.
But there were elements of kindness in his creed. He was willing to
teach; to advise.</p>

<p>"You catchee lich man," he insisted. "Lamon no good. Lamon no
good Portugee, catchee little money one time&mdash;bime-by all
gone. You sabe? All same Consuelo then, you sclubee floor&mdash;one
dollar&mdash;dollar-fifty. Lamon catchee 'nother damfool girlee.
This house cheap place. You no belong cheap place. You belong big
hotel. Plenty lich men come. Lich man like plitee girlee. Soft for
you. You sabe?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline's frown was going sixteen to the dozen, and her blue
eyes were rounded with astonishment. Dimly she did understand what
he meant, but only dimly. Yet his manner was not impudent; and she
realized it would not be the slightest use to be angry with him. It
was like being talked to by an automaton.</p>

<p>"You no walkee stleet," he went on. "Catchee bum&mdash;catchee
cop &mdash;catchee Clistian Sociation. No good. Catchee lich man,
big hotel. Can do. Me fix it. Mollow&mdash;nex' day&mdash;me makee
'langement. You lun away from here dam-quick. Catchee plenty lich
man, big hotel. You sabe?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline understood enough&mdash;enough, at all events to know
she wanted no more of his advice. She turned away from him and
hurried through the green baize door, glancing back over her
shoulder only once as the door swung shut. He was mopping the floor
dry, thrusting the pole back and forth mechanically in the
gaslight, with exactly the same expression on his face that was
there when she first looked up at him.</p>

<p>If he was thinking of her, or of anything in the world except to
get that floor dry, he gave no sign of it. Down at the far end of
that long passage, he looked like the automatic demon of the
underworld, sure of the ultimate victory of evil, and indifferent
as to how long any process took. Yet not unkind. He was the voice
of the subcellar and the gas-jet.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25">CHAPTER 25.</a><br>
"Who's that girl?"</h2>

<p class="first">"Papa" Pantopoulos was one hundred percent
American. He could prove it. He had papers. He was no impractical
theorist, but did in San Francisco as the San Franciscan
does&mdash;bought protection regularly at the going rate, and
supplied the best brands of bootleg to patrons who knew the ropes.
With the aid of dinginess, Levantine waiters, tomato ketchup and
spaghetti he had slowly built up a reputation for Bohemian
excellence, and now with fresh paint, new tablecloths and a
Czechoslovakian orchestra of five pieces he was bidding for a more
expensive clientele.</p>

<p>Bidding high, too. He had his advertising matter written by a
Hebrew who had failed at Hollywood, and he was all ready to rush
into print when Ramon informed him on a Sunday afternoon that La
Conchita would be his partner instead of Cervanez and they would
begin dancing for him the next evening, instead of a week later as
expected.</p>

<p>He had a gorgeous poster made in three colors&mdash;painted by
hand by the same gentleman who drew the duchesses in underwear for
the department-store advertisements; and he himself personally
nailed it up, under the new glass portico that he had bought at a
bargain from an up-town failed competitor.</p>

<p>"El Toro," that had been a dive&mdash;a joint&mdash;a café by
courtesy&mdash;was now a restaurant. And Papa Pantopoulos, even
with his bank-account down somewhere near the zero mark in
consequence of advertising space rates, was no small sport. Every
newspaper editor in San Francisco, all the sporting writers, the
dramatic and musical critics, and some of the managers of leading
hotels received two free tickets for dinners on the opening night,
in a pink envelope marked "Personal&mdash;Important&mdash; Rush!"
The tickets had the menu printed on the back, and on the face was a
portrait of "La Conchita" done in black and gold and green in
memory, by an artist who had heard a good description of her from
Papa himself. The black mask was the most nearly accurate part of
the picture; the rest of it was mainly twirling legs and
suggestiveness.</p>

<p>But Jacqueline knew nothing about any of that. She had been told
that important people would be present; Papa Pantopoulos bragged to
her about it after she and Ramon rehearsed that Sunday afternoon.
But Ramon told her afterward the important people would all send
substitutes, if they did anything at all, and that Papa was a fool
for his pains.</p>

<p>"It is our dancing, Senorita, that will produce the results, not
his vile cooking. We will dance until all San Francisco clamors at
his door! And then we will accept a real engagement elsewhere and
the crowd will follow us!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline thought that an ungrateful&mdash;almost an immoral
proposition; but she was too excited to dare to argue, knowing very
well she would get nervous if she did. It had occurred to her that
Ramon, Cervanez, Pepita, Consuelo, and even the adorable monkey
were all dependent on her success; and Cervanez rubbed that in
unfeelingly on the way back to the boarding-house.</p>

<p>Consuelo was already so nervous that there was no comfort to be
had from her. Jacqueline went upstairs and spent the rest of the
afternoon with Pepita and the monkey, playing games she had almost
forgotten and singing the old nursery songs that used to irritate
Donna Isabella "because they are foolish, and the niggers sing
them, Jacqueline." She could imitate a darky perfectly, and Pepita
so enjoyed the fun that Jacqueline forgot all about her own
troubles.</p>

<p>But they were all heaped on her once more at the evening meal.
The fat man, who seemed to be a fixture in the upstairs hall-room
and to know everybody's business, lectured her on stage
fright&mdash;warned her not to eat too much&mdash;advised her to
drink brandy and champagne before going on&mdash;and above all, not
to say her prayers.</p>

<p>"The stage an' the angels ain't on speaking terms," he assured
her. "I've known young girls who prayed for hours before their
first appearance&mdash; went to mass an' all that&mdash;flopped,
every darn one of 'em. The most successful young one I recall was a
girl named Juanita&mdash;that was her stage name anyway. I tried to
kiss her, and she got so mad-angry you couldn't hold her. Sore?
Believe me! She was boiling! When her turn came she went on like a
whirlwind&mdash;sang an' danced 'em out o' their seats, and they
called her back a dozen times. Made her! It sure did. She was a
headliner from that minute&mdash;until she tripped on an untied
lace one night an' went to hospital. Bu'sted her hip, or
something&mdash;complications&mdash;doctors did the rest&mdash;died
under chloroform, without ever thinking o' thanking me for having
tried to kiss her. Would it make you angry if I kissed
you&mdash;honey?" he asked, imitating Consuelo's accent and wiping
cabbage from his lips with a paper napkin.</p>

<p>He would have made the attempt, but for Ramon's suggestive
action with a table-knife. Cervanez, on the horns of anxiety, tried
to turn the conversation into safer channels, but the fat man had
started the ball rolling and nearly everybody at the table followed
suit with tales of stage-fright and disaster. Then some one with
his mouth full blurted out that Papa Pantopoulos was running El
Toro on a shoestring.</p>

<p>"Give him one week. If your turn don't crowd the place he's done
for. Those Greeks all cut each other's throats for a living.
There's three Greeks he owes bills to for beef an' supplies, an'
they'll take the joint over if he's a day late with the money. Has
he paid you in advance Ramon? Oh, you poor boob! You've a fat
chance!"</p>

<p>That sent Cervanez into hysterics. The meal broke up to the
shrilling of her fear, all hurled at Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"We find her&mdash;we be good to her&mdash;Ramon squander money
on her &mdash;an' now we starve! You all hear what he say&mdash;now
we starve!"</p>

<p>They carried her upstairs kicking; but she recovered soon enough
to invade Jacqueline's room while she was dressing and to chase out
Pepita.</p>

<p>"That child is jinx, I tell you! We bring her all the way from
Brazil, an' all she do is cost us money! Eat&mdash;she eat all the
time! Work? Never! When it is not one excuse it is the
other&mdash;truant officers&mdash; police&mdash;the doctors! She is
only good for play with monkey&mdash;I get rid of her!
Scat&mdash;you little nuisance!"</p>

<p>That helped decide the night's fate for Jacqueline. She had one
more to defend and protect. Consuelo first, and now little Pepita.
She would do or die, for the sake of Pepita! She would make a
reputation as a dancer, and earn money, in order to be able to take
that child away from such surroundings. The thought aroused all her
courage. She grew angry&mdash;even as the fat man
recommended&mdash;and ordered Cervanez out of the room &mdash;was
obeyed too. Cervanez gasped at her, and went. Consuelo knelt before
the washed-out image of the Virgin Mary in the corner by the end of
the bed, and snuffled as she prayed; but Jacqueline dressed herself
as if she were putting on armor&mdash;tied on the mask like a visor
behind which she would do battle with the world&mdash;and announced
herself ready.</p>

<p>Consuelo bade her kneel and say her prayers. "You'll need all
the help you can get tonight, honey darling!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Conchita!"</p>

<p>"I've done no wrong. I'm going to do my best. If Heaven won't
help me tonight without my asking, I'll never pray again,
Consuelo?"</p>

<p>She was adamant. The blue eyes blazed through the holes in the
mask, and her lips were set hard beneath it. "Go and tell Ramon I
am ready."</p>

<p>Ramon came dressed as a toreador in white and tinsel, looking
handsomer than Satan, fresh from a curtain-lecture by Cervanez and
carrying off his irritation under a veneer of swagger. He stumbled
over a big teddy-bear that Pepita had left on the floor, and kicked
it under the bed with a brimstone oath in Portuguese before he
offered his arm to Jacqueline. He could not have done better. That
act brought the very lees of her anger to the surface. Jacqueline
refused his arm.</p>

<p>"Bring that back here, Ramon!"</p>

<p>"Senorita!"</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>"The senorita jests!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. Dance alone, then! Consuelo, don't you dare to
do it for him!"</p>

<p>Ramon studied her a moment; but Jacqueline stood stock-still
waiting for him to obey or take the consequences.</p>

<p>"Temperament!" he muttered. "Oh, well!"</p>

<p>Placing a towel on the floor he knelt on it and reached under
the bed, recovering the toy and bringing it to her with an attempt
at half-humorous chivalry, expecting at least a smile in return.
But instead she flashed him a look of indignation, took the
teddy-bear, and ran upstairs to return it to Pepita, lingering so
long up there to exchange good nights that Ramon bit his
fingernails and swore. Consuelo had to go at last and bring her
down.</p>

<p>Then, on the way to the back entrance of El Toro, Cervanez
indulged herself anew in the luxury of high-pitched railing against
providence.</p>

<p>"We walk! My God, we walk like street-women! Not even a cab! We
must drag ourselves through dirt like the tramps to the back door
of a bum show&mdash; and all because you throw our money away,
Ramon! Does that Greek not know enough to send a taxi for us?"</p>

<p>"But three blocks&mdash;three or four blocks&mdash;what is
that?" asked Ramon.</p>

<p>"My dignity&mdash;is that nothing?" she retorted. "In Rio de
Janeiro we would have a voiture* if we crossed the street! You
bring us to the devil, Ramon! Down&mdash;down&mdash;down you bring
us. Three hundred dollars for that dress that Conchita is wearing!
And me&mdash;I walk!"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>voiture</i> (French)&mdash;a
carriage.]</p>

<p>Jacqueline had no pity to waste on Cervanez that night. She had
only scorn for ill-breeding and selfishness.</p>

<p>"Be still," she commanded. "You shall have your money back, and
the walk will do you good."</p>

<p>"Money back? I like to see it! I kiss myself good-by to it when
Ramon buy you that dress!" Cervanez retorted.</p>

<p>So between the boarding-house and the stage-door Jacqueline was
given no chance to recover her temper. She was angrier than she had
ever been in all her life. When Ramon suggested she should remove
her gold chain and locket before dancing, because it did not go
with the dress, she could hardly keep herself from slapping him.
Desmio's last present to her was the only thing she was wearing
that was her very own.</p>

<p>"You are impertinent!" She answered. "Why are we waiting? Why
don't we begin?"</p>

<p>The place had been a theater at one time, and the stage extended
all across one end of what was now the restaurant. Papa Pantopoulos
had given his last hostage to bankruptcy by ordering in potted
palms and a gorgeous back-drop recommended by the
electrician&mdash;a youth with the world before him, and an eye for
Jacqueline, intent on making miracles to satisfy her.</p>

<p>There was a clatter of knives and forks from beyond the curtain,
but not much laughter, and much less noise of conversation than
there should have been. Papa Pantopoulos came hurrying behind the
scenes, hot, napkin under arm, and almost frantic with anxiety.</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "It drags. It goes like a funeral!"</p>

<p>"Goin' to look like one, too, without another spotlight! Don't
say I didn't tell you!" warned the electrician.</p>

<p>"I spent too much!" Pantopoulos answered. "I close this place
tomorrow! Oh, my God! Miss&mdash;" (He hurried over to where
Jacqueline stood, and began to paw her hands in his anxiety.)
"&mdash;do me the little favor, please! Begin! My place is
full&mdash;there is not a seat left&mdash;but the black murderer in
the kitchen put too much tomato in the soup, and unless you make
them all forget it I am ruined! Don't wait until nine o'clock.
Begin now!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline caught Ramon's eye. Not a word passed. She commanded
him with a gesture. Pantopoulos hurried out to instruct the
orchestra. Consuelo sat down on a wobbly chair in the flies and
began fanning herself with a handkerchief. Cervanez struck a gong
and hauled up the curtain hand-over-hand. The clatter of plates and
forks increased. The stage became a sudden stunning sea of light.
"Ready?" asked Ramon. She hardly waited for him.</p>

<p>For a moment the hum of conversation rose&mdash;then dwindled,
gradually. Some one said "Bravo!" and two or three people clapped.
Jacqueline grew conscious of scores of eyes all focused on
her&mdash;dimly saw the heads of the orchestra below the stage, and
beyond them a wilderness of faces and white tables&mdash;hated
every detail of it all&mdash;and danced. &mdash;Danced like the
devil&mdash;stamped her heel into the stage and outdanced
Ramon&mdash;made him sweat and change and improvise to keep up with
her&mdash;tossed him scornful glances over-shoulder through the
mask, laughed as she thought of sudden new expedients to bewilder
him&mdash;closed with him to dance the tango steps that were his
special pride, and outdanced him again until he was nothing more
than an accompaniment to her pas seul.* She hated him, the
audience, and all the world&mdash;cared for nothing but to pay her
debt, and give the brutes their money's worth! And the
audience&mdash;for whom she cared nothing&mdash;nothing!&mdash;rose
in their seats to get a better view, clapping so thunderously when
she finished to the last drumming chords of the cymbalum that
Cervanez had to raise the curtain five times, while Jacqueline
stood stock-still in mid-stage, head erect, not even nodding thanks
for the applause&mdash;still furious.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>pas seul</i> (French)&mdash;a solo dance
or dance figure.]</p>

<p>"Conchita, we are famous!"</p>

<p>Ramon took her hand to lead her to the wings. Cervanez came
running to put an arm around her. She snatched away her
hand&mdash;ignored them both. Papa Pantopoulos came hurrying
behind, perspiring and excited, to beam with gratitude; she turned
her back on him. Consuelo threw a wrap over her shoulders, and she
found a few words at last.</p>

<p>"We will get out of debt now, Consuelo! and you won't scrub any
more!"</p>

<p>Ramon sulked. Cervanez sang to a new tune, setting a chair for
her, standing by to flatter and rearrange stray wisps of hair that
had gone adrift in the violence of dancing.</p>

<p>"You are marvelous, Conchita, marvelous! We make a fortune! How
you dance like that? What make you inspiration?"</p>

<p>Inspiration came that instant. Jacqueline looked over her
shoulder, her hand in Consuelo's lap. "Pepita!" she answered. "I'm
dancing for her! If you're ever cruel to that child again, that
will be the last time I will dance for you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Pepita! The little one, eh? Hah! So she pay dividend at
last!"</p>

<p>More inspiration! That remark disgusted Jacqueline more than if
she had seen Pepita being slapped. She snatched her hand away from
Consuelo, unable to endure even a true friend's petting, she was so
furious. If she must dance &mdash;and she would dance, to pay the
debt, and free herself, and Consuelo, and Pepita&mdash;she would
give her whole attention to that. There was nothing to talk
about&mdash;nothing! If she must make of herself a public
spectacle, it should be no poor one&mdash;nothing to regret! Only
something to hate, and hate, and hate&mdash;and triumph over!</p>

<p>How glad she was that Sherry did not even know her right name,
and that Desmio had not lived to see her earn her living on a
tawdry stage! This was that man Wahl's doing. In imagination she
could see Wahl's face grinning at her&mdash;the very devil's own,
delighting in her downfall! She wished he were there to see her
now, and yet she knew she would run from him if he were there! She
would like to prove to him that he could not destroy her with his
lies; and yet she knew he could! She knew that if Wahl discovered
her, and told who she was, and wrote more lies about her in the
papers, she would run &mdash;run&mdash;run&mdash;perhaps even kill
herself.</p>

<p>And in a corner of the restaurant, at a table under the balcony,
Clinton Wahl sat devouring free guinea-chicken and asparagus
vis-à-vis to a woman who was on much better than nodding terms with
most of the men around her. Mansfield senior had received the two
free tickets in pink envelopes, and had dispensed them as patronage
in the usual way, to whoever had the day off and cared to ask. It
amused Wahl to take a woman to a dinner that cost him nothing. He
had not the remotest intention of "writing up" the El Toro
restaurant or its proprietor, but Papa Pantopoulos fussed over him,
and supplied him with surreptitious cocktails in coffee cups,
expecting in return at least a quarter of a column on an inside
page.</p>

<p>"Who's that girl?" Wahl asked him, ten minutes after
Jacqueline's first dance, when Pantopoulos reappeared to hustle his
waiters. "Is Conchita her real name?"</p>

<p>"Aha! She is a discovery&mdash;a mystery&mdash;my discovery!"
Pantopoulos answered, grinning. "Nobody knows who she is&mdash;not
even I! But listen:" (he whispered behind his hand) "will you try a
Conchita cocktail? That is another discovery, not quite as good,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wahl nodded. He would try anything on the free list. Pantopoulos
hurried away to his secret locker.</p>

<p>"You got a crush on that dancer?" asked Wahl's companion. "Can't
you keep it till tomorrow? You're out with me tonight."</p>

<p>Her face fell sulkily as she looked into Wahl's eyes. They were
glittering. His face looked tense and set, as if he were trying to
remember something and the memory held vestiges of humor.</p>

<p>"You seen her before somewhere?"</p>

<p>Wahl did not answer. It was a part of his creed never to answer
a question unless it suited him, but to demand answers from
everybody else. Papa Pantopoulos came hurrying back with a flask
under his arm-pit.</p>

<p>"Something to help you remember La Conchita!" he whispered. "Is
she not marvelous? Is she not worth a column on a front page?"</p>

<p>Wahl almost terrified the Greek with the sudden vehemence with
which he seized his arm and pulled him closer.</p>

<p>"You want a write up! Front page? Introduce me to her then!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, sir, she must be a mystery&mdash;for a while&mdash;for
the sake of the advertising," Papa answered coaxingly. "Ask me
later on, sir. Not tonight."</p>

<p>"Before I leave this place!" Wahl answered. "If she's who I
think she is, you'll have all San Francisco in here before I'm
through!"</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed the Greek. "I will do my best to feed them!
Wait until after the next dance, and I will see what can be
done."</p>

<p>"I must see her without the mask on," Wahl insisted. "Will she
dance down here on the floor?"</p>

<p>"Not tonight, sir. Tomorrow I will move some of the tables up to
the balcony, and clear a space for the guests to dance. Then
perhaps I can persuade her to come down once from the
stage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where does she live?" Wahl demanded.</p>

<p>The Greek shook his head, pretending not to know.</p>

<p>"I could follow her home, of course," Wahl said with one of his
cold smiles.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;an' leave me flat?" asked his companion. Wahl
ignored her. He was watching Pantopoulos, recognizing speculation
in the Greek's eyes. The Greek was obviously weighing two chances
in the balance.</p>

<p>"If I catch her outside here, I'll write her up without
mentioning you, of course," Wahl assured him, tossing off the rest
of the Conchita cocktail.</p>

<p>"I will see what I can do, sir."</p>

<p>Pantopoulos hurried away, still undecided, but with a new and
brilliant notion in his head, which he allowed to simmer there
while he ran to and fro, between restaurant and kitchen.</p>

<p>"Service, children! Service! Smile! Get a move on! Oh, my God! A
man who runs a restaurant ought to have his head examined. Luigi,
that is not the way to serve cold artichoke. Where you work last?
In jail? Take that back to the kitchen!"</p>

<p>Cervanez rang the gong, and the curtain rose for the second
dance, disclosing Ramon and La Conchita glittering white and silver
in a pool of light. The orchestra swung into a lazy waltz strain
that set the guests humming, and Conchita swayed slowly out of
Ramon's arms, For a second Ramon was non-plussed&mdash;stood
looking at her, wondering what next; but the audience thought that
was part of the performance, and in a moment he was improvising,
dancing up to her, pursuing her in circles, every effort he put
forth serving to emphasize her art, as the obbligato serves a tune.
If her mood was not mischievous it surely seemed so from where the
audience sat, and the black mask increased the delusion.</p>

<p>"Thunder!" exclaimed Wahl. "If she's the same girl, she's had
teaching since. She danced like an amateur when I saw her
last."</p>

<p>"Where did you see her?" his companion asked, trying sulkily to
make the best of the situation.</p>

<p>"Not sure that I ever did see her," Wahl answered, watching the
stage like a hawk. "But I think I've seen the man, too."</p>

<p>"Well? What of it?"</p>

<p>"Big story!" Wahl answered.</p>

<p>Oh, you make me sick! Why can't you give me a write up? Aren't I
interesting? You said I was!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't interest the public, Harriet. Humpty-Dumpty's no
good after he's smashed, and you never had far enough to fall to
make an echo!"</p>

<p>He was watching the stage&mdash;watching Jacqueline as if his
eyes could pierce the mask, talking as if he were thinking aloud.
He understood as well as any one in the room that the dance was
marvelous, but all that did to him was to make it seem more worth
while to pillory the artist, if it could be done without risk of
suit for libel.</p>

<p>"I think you're a devil, Clinton!" his companion said suddenly.
"You'd rather ruin any one than see them get away with it."</p>

<p>The audience had risen out of the chairs again. The orchestra
had speeded up the tune in response to La Conchita's mood, and the
dance was ending in a wild delirious swirl of silken skirt and
stockings, with Ramon improvising faun-like leapings here and there
that were a million times better than anything he had ever
rehearsed. The curtain came down amid storms of clapping, and rose
again repeatedly, showing La Conchita stock-still, panting, in
mid-stage, and Ramon in the background, not daring to come near
her. But it looked as if he were modestly conceding her the whole
applause.</p>

<p>Papa Pantopoulos went hurrying to the kitchen to speed up the
service, and Wahl, watching the fat back disappear through the
swinging door, snatched opportunity.</p>

<p>"Stay here, or take a taxi home, I don't care which," he said to
his companion, and started in a hurry for the door beside the
stage.</p>

<p>Why bother to wait for introductions? Why ask questions? Why not
snatch that mask from the girl's face? If she turned out, as he
expected, to be Jacqueline Lanier, good; if not, he could
apologize. He had done more impudent things than that a score of
times, and had only once been thrashed at all seriously, for he
could use his fists a great deal better than the average.</p>

<p>But the door to the stage was locked, and he could not force it
without attracting too much notice. He wanted this story to himself
in order to do it justice, and to score another beat for the
Tribune. There was a door leading under the stage from the
curtained enclosure that half-concealed the orchestra. He ducked
under the curtain, stepped behind the piano, kicked the door open
and entered.</p>

<p>Just as he expected, there were steps leading up to a trap-door.
The trap- door was bolted from below, and he had no difficulty in
raising it. It brought him out into the wings to the right of the
stage, opposite to where Jacqueline was sitting beside Consuelo. He
started straight for her, almost running; but Cervanez, walking
across-stage with her back toward him, heard him&mdash;turned
suddenly&mdash;and sprang toward him, meeting him in the narrow gap
between two flies.</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?" she demanded. Instead of
answering, he tried to avoid her, dodging around the fly, but she
dodged the other way and met him face to face again.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"An interview. I'm from a newspaper."</p>

<p>"No-thing do-ing!" Cervanez spread her elbows between the flies
and blocked the way.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded. "I'm from the Tribune. Don't you want
good publicity?"</p>

<p>There was nothing that Cervanez wanted more; but she knew she
had her choice between secrecy and losing La Conchita.</p>

<p>"No!" she answered, signaling wildly to Ramon with her hands
behind her back. "This is private. Keep out!"</p>

<p>"Who is that girl? Tell me all about her."</p>

<p>Wahl was trying to see past her, but the stage was only dimly
lit now and the shadow was confusing. What he did see was that
there was no one near enough to run to this woman's assistance; and
all he needed was one glimpse behind the dancer's mask. He rushed
Cervanez suddenly and sent her reeling backward on her heels; but
you don't dance for a living for forty years or so without becoming
as wiry as a cat, and Cervanez sprang back at him, seized him by
both arms, and screamed.</p>

<p>"Ramon! Ramon! Reporters! Run! Quick!"</p>

<p>"Damn you! Hold your noise!" Wahl hissed at her, struggling to
wrestle loose from the strong lean hands. He struck her on the
elbow, and she let go, screaming with the pain. But he was too
late. As he leapt across the stage he saw a door on the far side
slam, and heard a key turn. Then Papa Pantopoulos came running to
know what the excitement was all about, and Cervanez appealed to
the Greek noisily, rubbing her elbow and gesticulating like a
fish-wife.</p>

<p>Nobody threatened Wahl, or talked of calling the police; he
noticed that fact. Papa Pantopoulos used persuasion, and Cervanez,
instead of abusing him for having struck her, began pleading.</p>

<p>"Please, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Wahl, please do not come behind
here!" urged the Greek, taking him by the sleeve and trying to lead
him off-stage by the door that connected with a passage between
restaurant and kitchen.</p>

<p>"Please!" Cervanez seconded. "She is very nervous and highly
temperamental! If she is frightened she will not dance!"</p>

<p>Wahl allowed himself to be led back to the dining-room, but he
felt nearly sure now of the dancer's identity. He was wondering
whether he dared to make the assertion in print that she was
Jacqueline Lanier, without first getting absolute proof.</p>

<p>Nothing like keeping on harping on the same string, when you had
a real story! Just sufficient time had elapsed since the first
scandal to make its reappearance fresh and interesting. Perfect!
The seventeen-year-old Herodias pretending to be drowned, and
turning up in San Francisco on a cabaret stage, masked, and dancing
a Bacchanale!* Did he dare?</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Bacchanale</i>&mdash;a dramatic musical
composition, often depicting a drunken revel or bacchanal.
<i><a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchanale">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

<p>Not yet, he decided. He must see her without that mask on.</p>

<p>"Take a taxi and go home," he advised the saddened Harriet. "I'm
going to hang around outside here, and watch where La Conchita
goes."</p>

<p>Papa Pantopoulos, coming up behind with cocktails to soothe
injured feelings, overheard him, and the notion he had carried in
his head for an hour crystallized at once into a purpose.</p>

<p>"There, sir&mdash;another Conchita! Genuine gin from over the
line, and a secret recipe of my own. What a pity we can't advertise
it! Hah-hah!"</p>

<p>Wahl tossed off the cocktail and bade him good night curtly,
hardly giving the discouraged Harriet time to gather up her wraps.
Papa Pantopoulos hurried to the stage again and summoned Ramon and
Cervanez from behind the locked door, where they were guarding
Jacqueline's retreat.</p>

<p>"Where is she? Not gone away?" he asked excitedly.</p>

<p>"She is hiding with Consuelo in a room upstairs."</p>

<p>"Ah! Listen to me. That man who came on the stage just now is
from a newspaper. I heard him say he will wait outside to learn
where she goes when she leaves here."</p>

<p>"My God! We shall lose her!" wailed Cervanez.</p>

<p>"Listen to me!" Pantopoulos insisted. But you couldn't listen
with Consuelo coming down creaky stairs and jerking at the door to
get it open.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" Consuelo demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>"A Mr. Wahl, from the Tribune newspaper," said Pantopoulos.</p>

<p>"Wahl? What's his first name? Clinton?"</p>

<p>The Greek nodded. Consuelo turned instantly, horror-struck, to
open the door and run upstairs again. Cervanez set her back against
the door.</p>

<p>"Let me through! Let me through!" Consuelo almost screamed,
tugging at the door-knob. "She will kill her self if that man finds
her!"</p>

<p>"Listen to me&mdash;please!" Pantopoulos insisted. "If you leave
this place tonight that man will see her, for he waits at the back
door. Let her stay here. Why not all stay here? There is an
apartment upstairs&mdash;a good apartment&mdash;several rooms, all
furnished. You may have them. You must fulfill your contract. I can
not afford to lose you, after all the expenses I have made. If you
will stay upstairs I will charge you nothing for the apartment; and
there are only two doors to upstairs&mdash;this one, and one to the
kitchen; we will keep them both locked!"</p>

<p>Ramon stroked his chin, struck his attitude of Old-World
dignity, and smiled.</p>

<p>"You are not the only one who can not afford things," he said
suavely. "We must pay our bill at the other place before the dragon
will permit me to remove our belongings. Now if the senor would
make payment in advance&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Greek sighed. "Pay!" he exclaimed. "It is I who must pay
everything! Where do I get the money, when half of the dinners
tonight are not paid for? Am I Midas?"</p>

<p>"You are he who must decide!" smiled Ramon with a low ironic
bow.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Ramon left the El Toro back door with money in
his pocket, striding with the swagger suitable to cash in hand. A
man stepped out of a shadow suddenly, confronting him, blocking the
sidewalk, thrusting cavernous eyes up close to his.</p>

<p>"What is your pleasure, Senor?" Ramon asked mildly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you La Conchita's dancing partner? Come now, tell me who
she is and I'll make it worth your while!"</p>

<p>"But I don't know, Senor!"</p>

<p>"Let me see her then!"</p>

<p>"She left for her apartment directly after the second dance,"
Ramon answered without hesitating.</p>

<p>"Where does she live?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Senor!"</p>

<p>"Rot!" Wahl answered. "Of course you know. See here; what's the
use of your trying to hide her? I know who she is, but I want proof
of it. The minute I have proof, you're famous! Can't you see the
value of that?"</p>

<p>"But what is fame without a fortune, Senor?" Ramon asked.
"No&mdash;I regret&mdash;I don't know who she is&mdash;or where she
is just now&mdash;or who you are," he added.</p>

<p>"I'll soon prove to you who I am!"</p>

<p>"Of what use, Senor? The acquaintance would no doubt be very
interesting to us both, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bowed magnificently. Wahl leered spitefully. Ramon strode
away down- street in the opposite direction from the
boarding-house, glancing over his shoulder, at the first corner to
see whether he was followed. But Wahl decided not to waste time
tracking him. He knew of at least one better way to get results,
and began to feel sorry he had put Ramon and Pantopoulos on their
guard.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26">CHAPTER 26.</a><br>
"I hate the Tribune!"</h2>

<p class="first">Wahl reached the Tribune office just in time to
catch Mansfield senior. They met face to face in the downstairs
lobby, and Mansfield turned back to the elevator. He could read in
a man's face that a story had "broken," without having to be told
in so many words and neither said anything until Mansfield sat at
his desk. Then Wahl cut loose in short excited sentences.</p>

<p>"The Lanier girl&mdash;I've found her&mdash;sure of it!"</p>

<p>"Go to it then!" snapped Mansfield.</p>

<p>"Don't dare. Can't identify her positively. Can't get to her.
She's dancing masked under the name of La Conchita at that El Toro
place you gave me tickets for."</p>

<p>"Ought to be easy," said Mansfield.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't. She's guarded by the gang she's dancing for, I watched
the back door. Nothing doing. I think she's living in rooms over
the restaurant. Listen, though: if she's the girl Sherry brought
back with him in the boat that night, as I suspect, he'll recognize
her. Where are those photographs that came from New Orleans?"</p>

<p>Mansfield opened his desk drawer and laid on the blotter six
pictures of Jacqueline Lanier.</p>

<p>"Doesn't look like a criminal, does she?" he said, examining
them one by one.</p>

<p>"The real ones never do," Wahl answered. "Why not lay those on
Sherry's desk, and watch him."</p>

<p>"Send for Dad," snapped Mansfield.</p>

<p>So Dad Lawrence left an account of Mrs. Somebody-or-other's
function in the middle of a word and sauntered in with both hands
in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Where's Sherry?" Mansfield demanded.</p>

<p>"Gone home."</p>

<p>"Get here ahead of him tomorrow, and put those on his desk. If
he seems disturbed by them, try to get him to come and talk to
me."</p>

<p>"Good lord!" Dad exclaimed. "Why don't you go home and pull him
out of bed, and have it out with him? What's new now?"</p>

<p>"I don't care to have him tell me lies," Mansfield answered.
"I'd rather he said nothing. But here's the point: Wahl thinks he
has found that Lanier girl. He also thinks&mdash;and I'm inclined
to agree with him&mdash;that Sherry really met the Lanier girl, and
fell in love with her when he was down there in Louisiana. If so,
he's in a bad way. Wahl believes the Lanier girl is dancing at a
café called&mdash;what's the name of it?"</p>

<p>"El Toro," sad Wahl.</p>

<p>"And what's her alibi?"</p>

<p>"La Conchita."</p>

<p>"D'you think Sherry knows?" asked Mansfield.</p>

<p>Neither man could answer that. Wahl was inclined to think not.
Dad ventured no opinion.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;put those photos on his desk, and watch him," said
Mansfield. "If he recognizes her, he'll show it. If this La
Conchita really is the Lanier girl&mdash;and if that's what's the
matter with Sherry&mdash;I'll break her on the' wheel for his sake
if for nothing else. By God! I'll not have Sherry ruined by a
female of that type! We'll drive her out of San Francisco!
Head-line her, until even that blind young idiot sees she's a bad
lot! D'you understand me, Dad? I'm looking to you and Wahl to help
me save Sherry. She's the worst type of woman there is!"</p>

<p>Dad stroked his chin. Wahl grinned.</p>

<p>"All right. See you boys tomorrow then," said Mansfield, and
walked out with an unlit cigar between his teeth. Wahl and Dad
stood and faced each other.</p>

<p>"It'll make a hell of a good story," said Wahl.</p>

<p>"I'm not fond of breaking women on the wheel," Dad answered,
"but if she's a real bad lot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's one of the worst!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and it's a case of saving Sherry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'd be pap for her! She knows his dad's a rich man. She'll
play him the way she did Calhoun in Louisiana&mdash;and marry his
dad under the boy's nose if she'd half a chance!" Wahl said
grinning. "She's a stunner to look at &mdash;dances like the
devil&mdash;and the mask adds the attractive mystery. She'll vamp
young Sherry to a fare-you-well, and he's the kind of youngster who
takes it seriously."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I guess we'll have to interfere," Dad answered
gloomily.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, then." Wahl laid a finger on the middle button
of Dad's waistcoat. "I've scared 'em. They'll be on the watch for
me. Suppose you go there tomorrow night and see if you can't get
next to her. Worm your way in, and strip that mask off her. Get her
story. Force a confession. I'll meet you outside afterward."</p>

<p>They agreed on that, but Dad did not like it. He did not like
Wahl for one thing, and for another&mdash;he was useless as a
muckraker&mdash;altogether too soft-hearted, and too inclined to
help the under-dog.</p>

<p>However, he was no more willing than was Mansfield senior to see
Sherry caught in the net of a designing female, so he fell in with
Wahl's plan.</p>

<p>He tossed on his bed that night in the room in a boarding-house
that he had occupied for fifteen years, wondering just why he felt
miserable at the prospect of the task in front of him. He decided
at last it was Wahl. He had utterly no use for Wahl&mdash;detested
him.</p>

<p>"That devil can't do right&mdash;can't be on the right side of
anything!" he muttered.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, he felt better when he came to that decision.
He was glad that he, and not Wahl, had the task of cornering La
Conchita and disillusioning Sherry.</p>

<p>Dad was not due at the office normally until three o'clock but
he was there the next afternoon at two, laid the photographs of
Jacqueline on Sherry's desk, and sat down at his own to smoke
cigarettes and wait. Sherry came in ten minutes ahead of time and
sauntered over with rather discouraged air, leaning against his
desk and waiting until Dad should choose to say what the afternoon
assignments were. It was several minutes before he noticed the
photographs; but he showed then the kind of timber he was made of.
His heart went to his mouth; he could not help giving a start of
surprise; but he covered it. He turned his back toward Dad. Then,
when he was sure of himself, he picked up the photos, examined
them, dropped them casually on the desk and looked out of the
window.</p>

<p>"Wahl sent for those from New Orleans," said Dad. "He thought
you'd like to look them over."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Sherry, without betraying the slightest
interest.</p>

<p>"Wahl believes that girl's in San Francisco."</p>

<p>But Sherry was surprise-proof. He had good reason to believe
that too. He knew the whole office, his father included, suspected
him of having met Jacqueline Lanier, and he was not fool enough to
doubt that those photos were laid on his desk for a trap. So Dad
Lawrence was also league against him! He understood now why his
father had turned him over to Dad to do this idiotic social stuff.
All right. He was all the more glad he had not taken Dad into his
confidence, as he had once thought of doing.</p>

<p>"Where do we go from hear?" he demanded with a bored air. "What
dummy gets gilded this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"We'll keep together until dinner-time," Dad answered. "After
that well have to divide forces. There's a concert you'll have to
cover at the Auditorium while I do the El Toro."</p>

<p>Sherry looked relieved, but said nothing. He could cover the
concert by asking for a program at the door; a fool could write up
a concert without sitting through it, and that would give him
several hours to hunt for Jacqueline. He had a notion this time of
searching through the hospital wards for her, and after that, if
there was any time left, of questioning the matron at the Y.W.C.A.,
although he would have to do that carefully for fear of starting
others on the trail.</p>

<p>He did not quite deceive Dad Lawrence. Dad noticed the look of
relief on his face when he learned he was to be alone that evening;
and Dad had covered far too many concerts in the same way not to
guess what Sherry intended. He was not quite sure that when Sherry
first saw the photos he had not checked a movement of surprise; and
he was more than ever, if as vaguely as ever, sure, that some sort
of love-affair was at the bottom of his young friend's
discontent.</p>

<p>"You seem to have no ambition left. What's the matter with you?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"I hate the Tribune, that's all!" Sherry exploded. "I'm sick of
the whole damned business!"</p>

<p>That answer settled it, as far as Dad was concerned. Of all
conceivable disasters, the worst would be for Sherry to fail to
follow in his father's footsteps! It would break old Mansfield's
heart a second time; and the result of that would be nothing that a
man could calculate, except that it would be hell with the lid shut
down! The Tribune would cease to be a newspaper; it would become a
slaughterhouse! The "old man" would turn on Sherry and cast him
off. Thereafter he would relapse into the condition he was in for a
year after Mrs. Mansfield left him&mdash;almost a maniac, with his
bitterest resentment turned on his truest friends, and obsessed by
one purpose: to destroy whatever woman's reputation he could get
his claws on.</p>

<p>Rather than that, Dad would probe any woman's anonymity, and
help, if necessary, to hound her out of San Francisco!</p>

<p>The afternoon hardened Dad's resolution. Whether or not her name
was Jacqueline Lanier&mdash;whether or not she and La Conchita were
the same &mdash;some woman was having a disastrous effect on
Sherry. It could not be anything else than a woman. The boy was not
drinking. He was not a gambler. He had no low companions. He was
simply moping; taking no interest in his work; brown-studying all
the time, and looking almost sick with worry. The least that Dad
felt he could do was to investigate this dancer in a mask and
either expose her identity or otherwise eliminate her from the list
of possibilities. Something had to be done, and done soon, or
Sherry would go all to pieces.</p>

<p>So by the time Dad reached the El Toro restaurant he was as
nearly in an iron mood as he ever had been in his life. He chose a
table under the balcony, midway down the room, from which he could
watch the stage without attracting attention to himself, and
ordered dinner. News of La Conchita had already spread among the
folk who dine in cabarets; some of the morning papers had carried
short paragraphs about her; there were owners of other cabarets
there, as well as a much better-dressed crowd than the El Toro had
ever entertained before; the place was full, and it was not going
to be easy to "pull" anything without attracting notice. Papa
Pantopoulos was hurrying to and fro with illegal drinks under his
jacket, doing a roaring business, sudden prosperity going to his
head, as his "Conchita cocktails" were going to the heads of some
of the guests.</p>

<p>There were seven in the orchestra tonight, instead of five.
Flowers on the tables. Four new waiters. Even the balcony was
crowded. The space that had been cleared for dancing in the middle
of the floor was as small as Papa had dared to make it, to allow
for extra tables, which were jammed so close together that the
guests could hardly sit without nudging one another's elbows.</p>

<p>Dad caught Pantopoulos by the coat-tails as he hurried by, and
the Greek jumped swiftly at conclusions. "Cocktail, sir?" he
whispered behind his hand. "La Conchita cocktail&mdash;very good!
Have to serve it in a coffee cup and charge for 'service,'
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dad nodded. "Tell me, will La Conchita come off stage?"</p>

<p>"Not tonight, sir. Can't persuade her. Between you and me, she's
a mystery. I've heard it whispered she's a member of the Russian
royal family, escaped from Siberia! I'll swear she's not used to
dancing in public&mdash; though she's wonderful&mdash;wonderful!
She's not so nervous as she was. Perhaps tomorrow night&mdash;my
advice is, come again tomorrow night, sir! Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hurried away with a sidewise grin, to chivvy waiters and mix
cocktails in a closet between dining-room and kitchen; and he was
hardly gone before a gong rang and the curtain rose. For the next
five minutes, Dad sat spell- bound.</p>

<p>He had seen more finished dancing&mdash;any amount of it;
although none much more so than Ramon's. It was something
indefinable about La Conchita's movements that made him oblivious
to the dinner growing cold in front of him. He could not explain to
himself just what it was. The black mask made her look mischievous;
yet experience had taught Dad a lot about reading faces, and he
could not force himself to believe that the lips below the mask
were hard or calculating. They were kissable; and if there was
anything else remarkable about them, they possibly suggested
sadness.</p>

<p>Her whole appearance struck Dad as incongruous in that
second-rate restaurant. It seemed to him that, while she was not at
all too skillful to be dancing there, showing only great natural
gift and a little stage training, she was none the less out of her
element. Her dancing looked pathetic; what seemed to the rest of
the crowd to be diablerie struck him as deliberate courage,
although he could not analyze the impression. She was wild at
moments; but it seemed to him that in those moments she had thrown
her very heart away and was dancing to kill her own thoughts. When
the curtain came down&mdash;and rose half a dozen times&mdash;Dad
felt almost positive that she took no pleasure in the storm of
applause; she stood stone-still, and looked defiant.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, if she's the Lanier girl she was nicely
raised, and that accounts for some of it," he told himself. "But if
she's a devil, she's a brand-new type. What beats me is,
why&mdash;with all that talent, and those good looks, and her
newspaper notoriety, if she is the Lanier girl&mdash;and if she's
the devil Wahl says&mdash;why&mdash;in-the-name-of-Satan&mdash;does
she dance in this joint, and hide her identity, instead of selling
her soul for much fine money? Why doesn't she court publicity?
There's something out of focus somewhere!"</p>

<p>He received the same impression during the second dance, only if
anything more definitely. There was something in her
dancing-partner's attitude that was more than clever trouping;
something in her attitude toward Ramon that was more than art.
Ramon was nervous, it seemed to Dad; he hardly dared to lay his
hands on her when they came together and swayed into a tango step,
and more than once she whirled away from him when he seemed least
to expect it. If the man had not been a skillful improviser the
dance would have collapsed.</p>

<p>Probably Dad was the only individual in the room who was
watching critically; the rest were swept away by La Conchita's good
looks, and by the novelty of seeing anything so beautiful in such a
tawdry setting. It seemed to Dad that she was doing something she
detested; that she was furious at being forced to do it; and that
that fury was the secret of the plan with which the dance went
over.</p>

<p>"Which makes it possible she may be the Lanier girl," he
admitted to himself.</p>

<p>She appeared four times, and in the intervals the guests milled
in a helpless mob on the floor between the tables while the
orchestra helped them to deceive themselves that they were dancing.
At the end of La Conchita's fourth turn Dad began to consider ways
and means, and plucked at Papa's jacket as he hurried by.</p>

<p>"What's it worth to introduce me to La Conchita?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Aha! That's what they all want!" said the Greek, and slipped
away.</p>

<p>Dad considered the situation. It was no use trying to reach the
stage by the door at the side, because everybody would be able to
see him and the waiters would undoubtedly interfere. Wahl had
alarmed them the night before, or so he said, and the Greek would
be on the alert. There would be a back door leading from stage to
street undoubtedly; in fact, Wahl had said there was; but that
would almost certainly be locked. There would be a fire-escape,
though&mdash;and neighboring roofs. Dad paid his bill, and went
outside to see. He hesitated for a long time in the shadow of a
doorway, and was at great pains to make sure there were no
witnesses, before he made up his mind to try the fire-escape, which
he had to reach by standing on an ash-can in order to jump and
catch the lower rung.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27">CHAPTER 27.</a><br>
"All the news the public wants."</h2>

<p class="first">Jacqueline's second evening was more distressing
than the first. The novelty was gone. She had a feeling in her
bones that the mask did not disguise her. Ramon and Papa
Pantopoulos had both been bragging about the first night's success,
and Ramon had shown her clippings from the morning papers. She was
nervous. Cervanez made her more so by over-friendliness, trying to
caress her when the one thing in the world she wanted was to be let
alone.</p>

<p>Then Ramon grew impossible. He had entered her room upstairs on
some pretext and made such a scene that Consuelo finally drove him
out with a hat- pin.</p>

<p>"Conchita, I adore you! I idolize you! Marry me, or I will kill
you and myself!"</p>

<p>The threat brought ghastly reminiscences&mdash;not that
Jacqueline, or Ramon himself, or any one believed a word of it. Not
even his mother Cervanez was in the least alarmed about his killing
himself. The fact was that he and Cervanez had laid their heads
together and decided it must be now or never; he must marry her
before offers of better engagements should begin pouring in.
Jacqueline understood that perfectly; and Ramon had enough
self-esteem to believe that no young woman could withstand his
tempestuous ardor; enough imagination, too, to believe himself
really in love for the moment.</p>

<p>"There is in me the blood of the Braganzas," he assured her when
she turned away from him. "That is royal blood, Senorita. I am not
of no account! My ancestor was one of the first founders of Brazil.
I am poor, it is true, but I have dignity and together we might
grow rich!"</p>

<p>It would have been comic, if it had not been so mortifying. She
must dance in public, with this man! She owed him money. And she
suspected, just as she could see through his amorous protests to
the avarice beneath, that he would betray her at the first
profitable opportunity. It made her almost physically sick to think
that her fate lay in the keeping of him and his mother.</p>

<p>It was that afternoon that Jacqueline first thought of suicide.
The meanness&mdash;the utter drabness of the life&mdash;the
confinement &mdash;hiding like a felon in shabby rooms above a
third-rate restaurant, with the key kept by a Greek, and the meals
sent up in secret, so that even the kitchen staff should not know
for certain where she was staying&mdash; the thought of what the
newspapers would print about her, if they should ever discover her
identity, and the likelihood that they might discover it at any
minute, all seemed to be heaped on her at once and made her so
homesick and wretched that death looked infinitely preferable.</p>

<p>She wished a thousand times over that Calhoun had shot and
killed her when he killed Desmio and himself. "Pray,
dear&mdash;pray to the Blessed Virgin," Consuelo urged, setting the
example so often that it became monotonous to watch. But Jacqueline
did not want to pray. She was rebellious against heaven. There was
nothing to pray for. Desmio was dead. Sherry was dead as far as she
was concerned. The devil, in the shape of Wahl, had painted her
black, and she would never&mdash;never&mdash;disgrace Sherry by
letting his name be associated with her in any way. She wished she
had never met him&mdash;wished she had been drowned before he found
her&mdash;anything! It was cruel to have met and loved him, for it
made her heart ache so terribly whenever her thought dwelt on him
for as much as a second&mdash;made it ache even more than when she
thought of Desmio.</p>

<p>But you couldn't commit suicide with Consuelo looking on. And
she knew it would be wicked. But what did it matter if she were
wicked? What had she ever done to merit all this misery? And could
anything be worse? Some one had told her that suicides go wandering
for ever and ever in empty space, with nowhere to go and nobody to
love them and nothing to do; but would that be worse than this?</p>

<p>And then came supper-time&mdash;and time to dress&mdash;and then
the summons to go down and dance; and she was still alive, and
still regretted it! She could hardly endure the sight or touch of
Ramon. He seemed common. Her whole nature was revolting against
vulgarity and against the mean expedients of poverty&mdash;against
manners laid on over corking avarice, and the thought of being
beholden to such people. She could have screamed when Ramon put his
arm around her as the curtain rose. But courage bred and born in
her; the harder it was tried the more it seemed to rally in
emergency and there were deeper depths to which she might sink; she
knew that since the Chinaman had talked to her in the basement
about "plittee girlee catchee lich man." And so her dancing was
even more full of energy and recklessness than on the preceding
night. She flung herself into it. She would not fail. She would not
let those people see her broken and frightened and sick at heart.
She hated them all, and herself more than all of them together. But
they should not know she was broken-hearted. And she would not
yield to her own distress. She would be brave. Desmio had always
said that bravery was the last true test of character.</p>

<p>The crowd was even noisier than on the previous night, but the
applause meant nothing to her. The brightness in her eyes was not
pleasure, nor even excitement, it was the stuff with which battles
are fought; and after the fourth turn Ramon knew better than to
accede to the Greek's importunity and try to persuade her to dance
a fifth time. Ramon went on alone and did creditably, keeping the
crowd spending its money in the hope that Jacqueline would
reappear. Consuelo sat at the foot of the stairs on guard against
any one who might try to invade the stage, as Wahl had done the
night before. Jacqueline went upstairs alone.</p>

<p>She felt there was only one thing in the world that could keep
her from breaking down. She must see Pepita&mdash;wake the child if
necessary. She must love some one who was not afraid. Some one who
was not afraid must love her. There was fear behind her&mdash;fear
in front&mdash;fear in the shadows at the corners of the
stair&mdash;fear of Wahl! She could see Wahl's face in the dark
whichever way she looked&mdash;dreaded to see him step out from a
corner&mdash;almost felt his cold hand on her wrist and behind
Wahl, again was the Chinaman. "Plittee girlee&mdash;" Pepita was
only afraid of bogies. Jacqueline could laugh at bogies, and that
might help her to feel easy about Wahl. She must do something.
Pepita was the only chance.</p>

<p>But when she entered the shabby bedroom at the end of a long
dark passage Pepita was fast asleep, with the monkey curled up on
the blankets beside her; and she had not the heart to wake either
of them. She would have loved to pick up the monkey and hug it to
her breast, but the little animal looked so like a child as it lay
there, and so comfortable, that she could not bring herself to
disturb it. She waited for several minutes, hoping Pepita would
wake of her own accord; then looked about her, wondering what to do
next. She knew she would grow hysterical if she went to her own
room.</p>

<p>The gas was turned low, but her eyes soon grew accustomed to the
dim light. There was a newspaper on the floor, with a pair of
scissors lying near it; Pepita must have been cutting up the paper
before bed-time. She stooped for the scissors, half-entertaining a
wild idea of opening a vein in her wrist, as she had read of women
doing in old story-books. But her eye fell on the newspaper, and
she forgot the scissors. She saw her own name, and a picture
beneath it. It was the magazine section of the Sunday Tribune, open
at Wahl's feature story. It was signed by Clinton Wahl.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to tear the paper into shreds. Her second
was to know the worst that Wahl could say about her. But where
should she go to read it! She could not endure her own room, and
besides, Consuelo might come in there, and Consuelo would snatch
the paper away. The thought of reading it had begun to fascinate
her. Once in Louisiana she had crept close and peered at a dead
Negro in a ditch with almost exactly the same sensation. She must
see&mdash;shrunk from it, and yet could not resist.</p>

<p>So she tiptoed out of Pepita's room and went up another flight
of stairs to the flat roof, where she had been that morning to
breathe the only fresh air obtainable. There were sky-signs all
around her, some of them quite close &mdash;notably a big one two
blocks away announcing in letters of golden flame that&mdash;</p>

<h5>MIRO'S MIRACULOUS RUBBERS MEAN LONG LIFE</h5>

<p>She made up her mind that instant never to wear rubbers. She
hoped to die young. Life was no good&mdash;nothing that Desmio's
enemy recommended could be any good. Then, for a little while she
thought of how John Miro must have come into possession of the
heritage that should have been hers, and hated him a
little&mdash;not on her own account, but because he had prevailed
against Desmio's wishes.</p>

<p>The light from some of the nearer signs threw a reflection on
the roof. She chose the place where the glare was strongest, and
sat on the edge of a skylight to read the paper, holding it with
both hands, because they trembled so and the trembling of one
off-set the other. But she left off trembling after a while. She
grew numb. The thing was so incredible&mdash;so indecent &mdash;so
untrue that she almost lost all feeling.</p>

<p>There was a drawing supposed to be her in her night-dress.
Another drawing represented her en deshabille* laughing over
Desmio's dead body. Yet another showed her laughing while Jack
Calhoun shot himself. At the bottom of the page she was represented
dancing, as if with delight that her lovers were dead; and there
were illustrations woven into the title at the top of the page,
representing Herodias with John the Baptist's head, and Jezebel,
and two or three other notorious characters, along with a great bat
supposed to be a vampire.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>en deshabille, dishabille</i>
(French)&mdash;in a state of partial undress; skimpily clad. See
<i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/68/98/1898.html">The American
Heritage Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

<p>The "story" was in keeping with the illustrations. It pointed a
moral. It posed as a warning to the public against unscrupulous
women. It represented her as having "vamped" an old man and a young
one simultaneously&mdash;the old man for his money, and the young
one for his looks&mdash;of having lured them both to their ruin,
and of having been amused to see the outcome. It suggested, without
exactly saying so, that Jack Calhoun had squandered all his fortune
on her, and had shot himself in her presence, after killing Miro,
because she sneered when he told her his fortune was all spent.</p>

<p>It dwelt lingeringly on the fact that Jack Calhoun had known the
way to her bedroom only too well, and that he had been surprised in
there with her at the very hour of wedding to the older man. The
imputation, though she hardly understood it, made her sick. It gave
an imaginary description of her flight in the dawn to escape the
questions of the coroner, and wound up with the question "Having
lost the enormous Miro fortune because she could not resist the
delight of a last embrace from the handsome lover, was she really
drowned in the Louisiana flood or, is she in hiding, watching for
an opportunity to lure rich men's sons into her toils?"</p>

<p>And that was Sherry's newspaper! That was no doubt Sherry's
opinion of her! Oh, how she hoped he would never discover that the
girl he had met in that barn in the flooded bottoms and Jacqueline
Lanier were the same! She hoped she might die before he ever could
find out the truth.</p>

<p>There was nothing else to hope for&mdash;only that, that Sherry
might never know. She turned her back to the light and walked
toward the darkest corner of the roof, for there was something
about darkness now that was comforting. She was no longer afraid of
it. She did not want to be able even to see herself. She wanted to
be nothing&mdash;nowhere!</p>

<p>She shrank against the brickwork of a chimney, and looked down
into the street. It was a long way down. It made her shudder, and
she looked up again, straight across the street. Then she almost
screamed&mdash;just checked herself&mdash;she must not let anybody
hear her scream. In letters of gold against the sky in front of
her, perhaps a dozen blocks away, was the sky-sign over the
building where they printed Sherry's father's newspaper &mdash;the
one that had blackened her forever:&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE TRIBUNE</h4>

<h4>ALL THE NEWS THE PUBLIC WANTS</h4>

<p>She stared at the great yellow letters of fire until they all
seemed to run together and make one word. NEWS! She was news! It
was there on the end of a yellow forefinger, pointing at her. There
was no escape from it! News, in a night-dress, with bare legs,
admitting a clandestine lover through the window! News, in her
underwear, laughing at dead men! News, dancing on her lover's
grave!</p>

<p>"Obey your intuition, Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>She could see Sister Michaela's gray eyes, and could almost hear
the words as if they were spoken from close by. Yes&mdash;she would
obey her intuition. She could feel relief at last. It was in the
air, waiting for her. Her heart told her this was the end. It did
not need courage to fall to the street. And when they should come
to pick her up, she would be all broken and unrecognizable, so that
Sherry would never know. Yes&mdash;she would obey her
intuition.</p>

<p>She climbed up on the waist-high parapet, and said one short
prayer at last&mdash;the first in three days. It was for Sherry,
that he might never know.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and please make him happy, Amen."</p>

<p>Then she closed her eyes tight, and let herself droop
forward.</p>

<p>When she felt an arm close suddenly around her and lift her back
on to the roof she thought at first that it was an angel's, and
that she was already dead. She was rather relieved and surprised to
learn that it had not hurt when she struck the sidewalk. But the
voice that spoke to her was too gruff for an angel's (she had
always thought of them as feminine) and the feathers she laid her
cheek against felt strangely like a man's coat. So she opened her
eyes, and realized that her mask was gone&mdash;that she was on the
roof&mdash;in a man's arms&mdash;looking straight into a man's
face.</p>

<p>Her heart began to flutter like a bird's now. She was coming to
life again, as it were, and feeling all the terror of it. She
struggled, too frightened to scream, and the man set her down on
the edge of the skylight, and then sat down beside her, holding her
hand very firmly and kindly. He had his heel set on the newspaper
she had been reading, but he seemed to be unconscious of it. He was
holding her mask in his other hand.</p>

<p>"Tell me, aren't you Jacqueline Lanier?" he asked her. For a
second she thought of lying to him, but she looked into his eyes,
and they were kind. She could not force herself to lie, it seemed
so useless.</p>

<p>"Why, you're only a child!" he said suddenly, and with so much
feeling in his voice that she could hardly keep the tears from
coming; only she did not want to cry before a stranger.</p>

<p>"Tell me, why were you trying to jump off the roof?" he asked.
"You're too young, you know, and life's too full of promise, for
anything like that. Why did you want to do it?"</p>

<p>Life was too full of promise? She looked up, and there stared
the Tribune sky-sign at her! She looked down, and there lay the
Sunday Tribune at her feet!</p>

<p>"Oh! I get you. Have you been reading that stuff?"</p>

<p>She nodded. She would have choked if she had tried to say
anything.</p>

<p>"For the first time?"</p>

<p>She nodded again, biting her lip to keep it from trembling.</p>

<p>"How much of it is true?" he asked. And he spoke so kindly that
she felt he really wanted to know it wasn't true.</p>

<p>"None!" she answered, choking.</p>

<p>"None whatever?"</p>

<p>She managed to find words somehow:</p>

<p>"Jack Calhoun did shoot Desmio and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. But about you? Why did you run away?"</p>

<p>"Things like that were in all the papers!" she answered with a
shudder. "A dreadful man named Wahl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure. Clinton Wahl. I know him."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you know Wahl?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I'm on the same newspaper. My name's Lawrence. They call
me 'Dad' Lawrence," he answered, more kindly than ever. "Now, don't
be afraid of me, you poor little woman! I think I understand what's
happened. I'm not Wahl. I'm not his friend. I hate him, if that's
any solace to you. Don't run away &mdash;I won't hurt you. Sit
here; and suppose you tell me your version of it all. You may tell
me in confidence. If I think you're telling me the truth, I I'll do
the best I can for you. There now, sit on my overcoat. That's all
right&mdash;cry if it helps any; but just tell me. Suppose I ask
some questions&mdash;how'll that be?"</p>

<p>He put an arm around her shoulder, and she felt more comforted
by it than by anything that had happened to her since she ran away
from Sherry that night in the dark. She just lay her head on his
shoulder and sobbed. He seemed like an angel after all!</p>

<p>"Did you ever meet Sherry Mansfield?" he asked.</p>

<p>She sat bolt-upright instantly, and her frightened blue eyes
stared at him through the tears.</p>

<p>"I see you did," he said quietly. "Have you seen him since he
came ashore in the same launch with you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Does he know where you are?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope not!" she stammered. "Please don't tell
him!"</p>

<p>Her eyes sought the newspaper, and then the Tribune sky-sign. It
was rather obvious why she did not want Sherry to know her
whereabouts. Dad looked at her with emotion that very nearly had
the better of him.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, making his mind up that instant. "I won't
tell him. Tell me this, though: did you and he&mdash;here, come,
Miss Lanier! I'm your friend. Tell me your whole story."</p>

<p>He took her hands and held them in his own, obliging her to face
him, yet doing it so gently that she felt no impulse to resist.</p>

<p>"You won't tell Sherry?"</p>

<p>"No. I won't tell him a word. And I'm your friend. But that's
all I promise."</p>

<p>Her eyes met his, and she began haltingly, almost in spite of
herself. And then, at the end of the first few stammered sentences,
it began to feel good to tell him. It was almost like a confession
to Father Doutreleau. Dad listened with such a world of sympathy,
and so obviously believed every word she said, that one thing led
to another and almost before she knew it she was showing him
Desmio's portrait in the locket, and discovering the same old
difficulty in finding words that were good enough to sound Desmio's
praises.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "yes, go on. I'm listening."</p>

<p>She spoke very little of the tragedy; but she told how Wahl had
come in, and had seized her wrist, and of the awful things that
Wahl had written in the New Orleans papers. And then of how she and
Consuelo had left the house before dawn, with the idea of running
away anywhere.</p>

<p>"Didn't know where you were going?"</p>

<p>"No. Where was there to go?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Any money?"</p>

<p>"No. I had some jewelry, but we lost that in the flood."</p>

<p>"Go on. Tell me about the flood."</p>

<p>That was soon told. She did not remember much of the first part,
except the rush of water and the sensation of being overwhelmed,
with the horses coming backward over the carriage, and then of
being plunged and whirled interminably in dark-brown water.</p>

<p>"And then I came to on a roof that was floating&mdash;and, the
sky going round and round&mdash;and a dog came and sniffed me."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's got the dog now. Nut, his name is&mdash;an awful
mongrel, but as cute as the dickens."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's got Nut! Oh, I'm so glad. I did so want to know what
had happened to Nut."</p>

<p>"Nut's all right. Tell me about him."</p>

<p>"I just love him, Mr. Lawrence! He crawled up one side of the
roof, and I crawled up the other, and we met at the top, and you
would never believe how rude he was!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes I can believe it!" Dad laughed. "I know Sherry."</p>

<p>"But he was a perfect dear. He ordered me around, and bossed me.
And he swore dreadfully, after we got into the barn and he found a
blunt razor and no looking-glass. After a while I shaved him! Yes,
I did. We were more friendly after that. And then we got talking
about his mother&mdash;and I said what I thought about
her&mdash;and he listened&mdash;and&mdash; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All Sherry ever needed was to fall in love!" Dad blurted
suddenly. "I've said so to his father time and again."</p>

<p>"Oh, he must! I hope he will! He must fall in love with some one
and forget me! I'll never forget him, but&mdash;but aren't men
different?"</p>

<p>"Some are," Dad answered dryly. "You've promised, haven't you?
You have promised? You won't say a word to Sherry?"</p>

<p>"Not one word!" Dad answered.</p>

<p>And you won't tell the newspaper you've found me?"</p>

<p>"I will not!"</p>

<p>"I'll be gone soon, Mr. Lawrence. As soon as I can pay my debt
to these people I'll run away and hide again. Sherry mustn't ever
know who I am. It might ruin him. The disgrace of being mixed up
with me, after what the papers said, could never be lived down.
Could it? And you know, he's obstinate; he might think it was his
duty to go in spite of everything, when, of course, it isn't his
duty at all, and&mdash;and&mdash;he is obstinate! Isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope&mdash;I mean, yes&mdash;he's a great hand to stick
to anything he starts."</p>

<p>Jacqueline's blue eyes, as innocent and truthful as the sky,
looked through the tears into Dad's, and he was not fooled by that
frown of hers for a second; it only made him believe her all the
more, if that were possible.</p>

<p>"I was only two days with him, but I know him so well, Mr.
Lawrence. And it's because I know he's obstinate that I'm never
going to let him find me. I don't mind what happens to me any more.
I just love Sherry, and I won't have him ruined. You know him quite
well of course?"</p>

<p>"You might say intimately," Dad answered.</p>

<p>"Tell me: does he&mdash;is he&mdash;do you think he has
forgotten me? I want him to," she added, forcing herself to say
it.</p>

<p>"He doesn't talk about you," Dad answered.</p>

<p>"Is he happy?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think he is. In fact, I'm sure he's not."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Lawrence&mdash;do you think it would make him any
happier if I let them identify me, so that he'll know I'm the one
they wrote all that about? Perhaps he'd hate me then, and put me
out of his mind. I'll&mdash; I'll make any sacrifice for
Sherry!"</p>

<p>She was trembling at the thought of it. Dad knew that, for he
was holding her hand.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "Sherry's not that kind of fellow. How long
have you got to dance in this place?"</p>

<p>"Until I've paid my debt."</p>

<p>"How much do you owe them?"</p>

<p>"I don't know!"</p>

<p>Dad smiled broadly. How even Wahl could have mistaken her for a
vampire was beyond him. He wished his own bank-account were not
down somewhere near the twenty-dollar mark. However, he did not
doubt he could borrow if he looked around, and meanwhile there was
at least something he could do to help her.</p>

<p>"You feel better now, don't you?" he asked. "Just keep on
dancing for another night or two, and meanwhile I'll do my best for
you. Remember, you've got a friend. I'll stand by you through thick
and thin, and if I can keep the papers from finding out who you
are, I will."</p>

<p>"And you won't tell Sherry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I won't tell him," Dad answered; but he could not keep
the evasiveness out of his voice, and she detected it&mdash;looked
alarmed. He did not choose to be committed any deeper at the
moment, not having quite made up his mind what he did intend to do.
"I'll have to go," he said, "or there may be some one else nosing
on your trail. Is there any way of my going down through the house
without being seen?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"All right. I'll use the fire-escape again. Now remember, little
woman, I'm your friend! No more nonsense, eh? No jumping off roofs!
Promise!"</p>

<p>He was gone before she could say good-by to him, but she leaned
over the parapet and caught one glimpse of his face as he looked up
smiling.</p>

<p>"Now remember," he called, "you've promised!"</p>

<p>Dad swung himself down from the fire-escape, shoved his hands in
his pockets, and sauntered around to the main entrance. Wahl was
about due. He must think of something to say to
Wahl&mdash;something with a trace of probability about it; and he
must get absolute control of himself, so that Wahl's too alert
suspicion should not be aroused. Lord, how he hated and
despised&mdash;mischievous devil! But "O mischief, thou art swift!"
he quoted.</p>

<p>"And old Mansfield thinks he's a snorter. So he is. God Damn
him! Sells newspapers. So he does&mdash;and damn the swine who buy
them! We're a rotten lot of vultures raising a stink with our claws
and wings in the sewer! And the public's worse&mdash;it likes to
see it&mdash;pays money for it! Wahl would crucify that girl, if
the law would let him, and the public would go broke buying
ringside seats! To hell with the whole dirty business!"</p>

<p>However, those reflections were not helping him to think up an
alibi to give Wahl. He must invent something convincing, in order
to gain time. Lord knew, he needed time if he were going to help
the poor little woman. There was nobody&mdash;actually nobody he
dared to confide in. And if old man Mansfield should ever learn
that he had deliberately sidetracked the Tribune on a story, not
even a thirty-year-long intimacy would stand between him and
dismissal. Jobs are none too plentiful for men of Dad's age. He
shoved his hands into his overcoat pockets and strode up and down
under the El Toro portico, waiting for Wahl to come, and cudgeling
his brains for the right solution.</p>

<p>But Wahl came before he had thought of the right one&mdash;Wahl
with the mean grin, and the cavernous rapacious look in his eyes,
evidently anticipating good news.</p>

<p>"Well? You had word with her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Good God! Did you try? What happened?"</p>

<p>Dad began improvising&mdash;lying right and left at random.</p>

<p>"You're on the wrong scent, Wahl. It's a mare's nest. I got
close to the stage, and saw her for a moment with the mask off. It
came unfastened. She wears that mask to hide a long scar on her
right cheek. She's nothing like the Lanier girl's pictures."</p>

<p>Wahl looked very keenly at him. "What's that on your knees?" he
asked him. "Rust?"</p>

<p>Dad had forgotten that the fire-escape was rusty. He stooped,
and brushed the stuff off.</p>

<p>"Wonder where I got that," he remarked.</p>

<p>"There's some on your sleeve, too," Wahl assured him. Dad
removed his overcoat and slapped it vigorously.</p>

<p>"Did it look like a new scar or an old one?" Wahl asked, eying
him keenly.</p>

<p>"Old. It might be a birth-mark."</p>

<p>"How close were you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a few feet from the stage."</p>

<p>"Ridiculous! You couldn't possibly have seen. It may have been
grease- paint&mdash;or anything."</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly sure," Dad answered.</p>

<p>But Wahl felt perfectly sure Dad was lying, and he made no
effort to conceal the fact. He favored Dad with one long searching
glance, and turned away without another word, walking off as if he
knew exactly where he was going, and what he would do next.</p>

<p>"He's got a joker up his sleeve," thought Dad. "I wonder what
next. Something damnable, and under the belt, I'll bet! Well: that
girl has one chance&mdash;Sherry! Here goes!"</p>

<p>With his head down, and hands deep in his pockets, Dad walked
slowly toward the Tribune Building.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28">CHAPTER 28.</a><br>
"Does she remind you of any one?"</h2>

<p class="first">Dad missed Sherry that night. He found a note on
his desk instead.</p>

<p>"Here's the program of the concert. For God's sake write it for
me. Cox of the Star said three, nine and eleven were rotten, but
the rest got by. House two-thirds full. The mayor and his wife were
in a box&mdash;nobody else of importance. Two sticks plenty.
Explanations later. Sherry."</p>

<p>Sherry had intended to search hospitals, but he was too gloomy
and discouraged to feel really set on any course, or nothing less
than violence would have changed his purpose. It was John Miro who
talked him out of it. They met in the foyer of the Auditorium,
where Miro had a lone seat for the evening. Sherry had just
obtained his program, and was on his way out in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Is it going to be as rotten as all that?" asked Miro, with one
of his discerning smiles.</p>

<p>"I'll find out from you, when it's over!" said Sherry.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>Sherry told him.</p>

<p>"My dear boy; you'll be simply wasting time. They account for
people in hospitals day by day&mdash;you know that surely? And
Sister Michaela has been to every one in the city."</p>

<p>"Dammit, I must look somewhere!" Sherry exploded. "I can't sit
still!"</p>

<p>"Let me give you some advice," Miro answered, studying him
thoughtfully. "You're giving discouragement the upper hand. That
won't do, you know. It isn't fair to her or anybody. You'll be
useless when the time comes for action."</p>

<p>"If it ever comes!"</p>

<p>"It will. It will certainly. My men are on a hot scent. I'm
expecting news of her at any time. Do you play chess? Checkers?
Come home with me and play checkers for an hour or two. Let's make
a bargain first, though: not one word about Jacqueline! We must
both think of something else."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to stall me, so your men will find her first?"
asked Sherry rudely.</p>

<p>Miro took him by the arm. "Come along," he said, "I knew you
needed to play at something for a while!"</p>

<p>He almost threw Sherry into a great limousine, and whisked him
away to a mansion that was furnished with the loot of Europe. There
with suits of armor grinning at them from either side of an
enormous fireplace, they played checkers; Miro regaling Sherry at
intervals with tales of life as he had lived it&mdash;fascinating
tales&mdash;until the concert-hour was nearly over and it was time
to hurry back in search of a reporter who had had sufficient sense
of duty to sit through it.</p>

<p>"When you've turned in your notes, come back and spend the night
with me," said Miro. "Then if any of my men bring news of her,
you'll know it as soon as I do."</p>

<p>Sherry did that; but he offered Dad no explanations the
following afternoon; said nothing at all, in fact, until Dad
broached the subject of the evening's assignment.</p>

<p>"We'll go together tonight," said Dad. "There's a place called
the El Toro that's been advertising heavily and made something of a
stir."</p>

<p>"Why together? Can't you do it?" Sherry objected.</p>

<p>"It's your turn to write something!" Dad answered, smiling. "I
wrote your concert stuff last night."</p>

<p>"Say, Dad, I've got something else to do tonight. It's
important. I'll explain it some day. I'm not bulling you, it's
urgent. Can't you go alone tonight, and let me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing!" Dad answered blandly. "You and I dine together
at the place I said. That's orders; and as long as I'm your
boss&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sherry turned away from him with a gesture of impatience, and
sulked over by the window, watching the sidewalk opposite as if he
hoped to recognize a lost acquaintance in every passer-by.</p>

<p>And inside the "old man's" private office Wahl held forth on the
carpet in front of the desk. His eyes were glinting, and his long
arms were moving in nervous jerks.</p>

<p>"But I've known Dad for thirty years," said Mansfield. "He's a
duffer in a lot of ways, but there's no man in San Francisco I'd
sooner trust. I don't believe he would give us a bum steer. Why
should he?"</p>

<p>Wahl grinned cynically. "I believe he interviewed that girl," he
answered. "I'm dead sure he was lying to me. I believe she put it
all over him, the same way she probably put it over Sherry down in
Louisiana. Dad's soft, and she simply vamped him&mdash;played on
his pity, I guess. I'm willing to bet you we've got her to rights!
We'll know tonight anyway. It's all O.K. with the Prohibition
Chief. I told him they're selling liquor at the El Toro, and if he
doesn't raid the place tonight we'll roast him good and plenty in
tomorrow's paper. He gave orders, and they're going to make a real
spectacular raid of it. I make my entrance with the bulls. There'll
be a panic when they pull the place, and that'll give me the chance
I want to corner the Conchita. I'll have that mask off, if I have
to fight her for it. Then we'll know for sure, and I've got the
story already written. You'll have to see the circulation manager.
She'll boom!"</p>

<p>"All right. Have it your own way," said Mansfield. "Will they
arrest the girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if they can find the least excuse for it. If there's rum
behind the stage, for instance&mdash;or if her dress is cut too
low&mdash;or if she makes a bolt&mdash;or anything like that. Gee!
If they only pinch her, that'll make it perfect!"</p>

<p>"Be sure you're on hand when they pull the raid," said
Mansfield. "We don't want any guess-work."</p>

<p>"You bet! I'll wait there at the station, and leave with the
raiding squad."</p>

<p>It was a desultory afternoon in the office&mdash;one of those
days when nothing of importance "broke" and the men who were
normally most active played rummy or did rewrite stuff&mdash;the
sort of day on which anything gets into the papers&mdash;a day
beloved of press-agents, propagandists, et hoc genus omne.* Wahl
spent the afternoon touching up his story in advance, adding
high-lights here and there, improving on the head-lines, and
telephoning once or twice to the police as a precaution. Dad and
Sherry covered a poultry show, and by the time evening came Sherry
was about as amiable as a stung bear. He walked into the El Toro
behind Dad, and stood surveying the newly, cheaply gilded
restaurant with an air of unmitigated disgust.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>et hoc genus omne</i> (Latin)&mdash;and
their ilk. <i><a href=
"http://catholic.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe?et+hoc+genus+omne">
William Whitaker's Words</a></i>. ]</p>

<p>"Those lousy hens were more exciting than this!" he grumbled. "I
suppose now we'll eat the birds that didn't win prizes."</p>

<p>The place was nearly full already, but Dad contrived to get a
table at a corner of the dancing floor, and Papa Pantopoulos
recognized him.</p>

<p>"Aha! So you took my advice! I told you! She dances one dance on
the floor tonight&mdash;just one! A 'Conchita' in her honor, sir?
Two? Certainly."</p>

<p>Sherry tossed off the cocktail, tasted his soup and answered
Dad's efforts at conversation in monosyllables. His eyes were all
the while roving about the room, and glancing up at every fresh
arrival.</p>

<p>"Did you see that poster as we came in?" Dad asked.</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-s."</p>

<p>"What did you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Pretty rotten. "</p>

<p>Dad smiled patiently. It was true, the poster was not art, but
he had hoped it might suggest a memory.</p>

<p>"Did you notice the name on it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You haven't a reporter's nose. You're no hound!" Dad assured
him.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of being a reporter. It's a dirty business," Sherry
answered. "If it weren't for&mdash;"</p>

<p>The orchestra struck up before he finished the sentence, and he
turned to face the stage with an air of relief, as if any kind of
conversation was a bore. Dad watched him keenly as the gong rang,
and the curtain rose on a newly decorated stage; for Papa
Pantopoulos had scraped up the wherewithal and plunged on repainted
scenery.</p>

<p>La Conchita waltzed on from one wing, Ramon from the other and
they met mid-stage, posing for a moment in the spot-light. But
there was no recognition in Sherry's face&mdash;not a
tremor&mdash;not a quiver of the eyelids, though Dad was watching
him keenly and would have detected the slightest start.</p>

<p>"Does she remind you of any one?" he asked.</p>

<p>Sherry stuck a fork into something on his plate, and went on
eating.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "Does she you?"</p>

<p>"Something vaguely reminiscent. Can't say who," Dad
answered.</p>

<p>Sherry looked back at the stage, and Dad thought he caught just
a flash of a change of expression, as if some movement of the
dancer had touched a chord of memory. But in a moment it was gone
again. Sherry's memory was of a blue-eyed girl with untidy hair, in
a dress all creased from being wet. The mask made La Conchita's
eyes look dark and mischievous, not tender. The stage made her look
taller. The dress made her look like a Spaniard and the dance
deprived her of all resemblance to the Conchita he had known.</p>

<p>Besides, in his own mind he had taken to calling her Jacqueline
since his talk with John Miro. The real name had displaced the
other almost totally, as real things have a way of doing. He had
imagined her poverty-stricken, crouching away somewhere in hiding,
shrinking from publicity; and this girl, who looked years older
than Jacqueline, dancing in the limelight with a male companion,
conjured up no recognition. She almost fooled Dad Lawrence, she
looked so different on the stage, and her mood had altered since
the previous night. For her hope had risen since Dad found her. She
was no longer rebellious (which was one reason why Papa had been
able to persuade her to do one turn tonight between the
dining-tables). She had a friend now whom she believed in; and she
could not help feeling glad that Sherry was worried about her, even
though she was more determined than ever not to let him find her.
So she danced with an altogether different élan, using more art,
and less sheer recklessness. On the whole, the audience was not so
well pleased.</p>

<p>"I don't think so much of her," said Sherry when the curtain
came down. He began at once to pay attention to his dinner, and did
not notice the expression of comic patience on Dad's face.</p>

<p>During the interlude, while most of the guests left their seats
to surge back and forth in a mob on the dancing floor, Sherry
munched away steadily, only offering one observation in response to
Dad's efforts to beguile the time.</p>

<p>"If you can make a story out of this joint, you're a genius!" he
remarked. "The grub's bad. The service is worse. The dancing's
nothing special, and the orchestra is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As good as the concert you covered last night?" Dad suggested
with a grin. "Where were you? You promised explanations."</p>

<p>But Sherry did not answer. He had become an expert in silence.
He said nothing until the curtain rose again and Papa Pantopoulos
jerked aside a low screen that concealed newly-placed steps leading
down from stage to floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, darn this cabaret stuff!" Sherry grumbled then. "Don't you
hate to have 'em shaking rouge all over you? Why can't they stay on
the stage where they belong? They don't look so cheap at a
distance."</p>

<p>He would not even look up when the dancers came tripping down
steps, amid applause led by Papa Pantopoulos and the waiters. Papa
was playing his big stake, and proposed it should go over with a
flourish, and the crowd&mdash; like most crowds&mdash;behaved
obediently. There was applause enough to have gratified the Russian
Ballet, and for the first time Jacqueline felt fired by it. Ideas
are strange intoxicating stuff. Perhaps because the unexpected
friend had come to her the night before, like an angel in a rough
tweed suit, she began to feel as if the room were full of friends,
and to try hard to please them instead of to triumph over them.</p>

<p>Ramon caught the inspiration. He was wonderful at that. As
subtly as if he had thought it out for weeks before, he danced in
harmony to her new mood, adapting himself to it, suggesting
phrases, as it were, and then&mdash; catching the approval of the
audience&mdash;sweeping her into a waltz-step that exaggerated the
natural youthful grace of his partner's motion. The crowd began to
cheer again without any hint from Papa. Twice around the room they
whirled in quickening cadences, the orchestra taking its cue from
them, when suddenly in mid-room Ramon whispered to her and they
parted company, flying like spinning Pierrot and Pierrette in
opposite directions.</p>

<p>Jacqueline's tangent brought her close to Sherry's corner, and
she paused there, hardly knowing what to do next. It was only
accident that made her glance at Sherry's table, as she turned her
head quickly to take her cue from Ramon. Dad was watching Sherry as
if he expected to see him leap from his place. Sherry had looked up
at Jacqueline because he could hardly help it. And so their eyes
met.</p>

<p>She knew him instantly. Her heart leapt so, it made her gasp; it
sounded like a sob. The sea of faces all about her became a haze,
with Sherry's head and shoulders like a cameo set in the midst of
it. He was staring at her. He would recognize her in a second! He
would know her for the girl that Wahl had blackened! He would feel
the shame of her dancing in a cabaret! He would &mdash;</p>

<p>She did not know whether he had started to his feet or not.
Something happened. Something broke the spell of frozen
fascination. Something&mdash; she did not know what&mdash;gave her
presence of mind enough to glide into a waltz' and spin away toward
Ramon, who met her in mid-room; dancing toward her.</p>

<p>"What is it, Conchita?" he whispered. "Courage! Courage!
Pep-zip-snap!"</p>

<p>"Toward the steps!" She would have screamed it at him if she had
had to say it twice.</p>

<p>He recognized emergency and whirled her in the right direction,
but she could not wait to do the dance-up steps that they had
practiced all afternoon. She broke away, ran up to the stage, and
disappeared into the wings, leaving Ramon to improvise alone.</p>

<p>"My God!" Cervanez almost screamed, trying to stop her in the
wings as she fled toward the stairs. "What is wrong? You ruin
us!"</p>

<p>But Jacqueline did not care who was ruined, provided it should
not be Sherry. She knew he would follow if he recognized her; and
he was so obstinate that he would probably claim her before all the
world, in spite of everything&mdash;and be put to open shame, as
she had been&mdash;and quarrel with his father&mdash;and lose his
friends. She must run&mdash;run! And there was nowhere to run to
but upstairs&mdash;up to her own room, and lock the door. She must
tell Consuelo, and they must think of some way of escape at once!
But the bedroom was empty. Consuelo, she remembered now, was
downstairs in the kitchen, having supper.</p>

<p>Jacqueline locked the door, and sat on the bed
bewildered&mdash;nearly fainting.</p>

<p>Sherry, who had almost risen to his feet, sat down again and
passed a hand over his eyes. He did not believe them. That could
not be the girl he had met in Louisiana. Yet&mdash;</p>

<p>"Does she remind you now of somebody?" asked Dad, and Sherry
stared at him.</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;are you&mdash;?" Sherry rose from his chair, his eyes
fixed on Dad's and all his gloom gone. His chin came forward
suddenly. "Wait here!" he said, and rushed away knocking his chair
over.</p>

<p>Ramon was still dancing, with his back to the stage. Sherry ran
past him and up the steps, straight into the wings, the way
Jacqueline had gone. Cervanez screamed, and ran to intercept him,
but he had seen the door leading upstairs that Jacqueline had not
quite closed behind her, and ten of Cervanez could not have stopped
him. Besides, Dad had followed. Cervanez found herself with two men
on her hands; she turned in panic to look for Ramon, who was
dancing like a marionette, oblivious of everything except that he
must "hold" the audience and save a situation. The second that she
wasted trying to catch Ramon's eye was enough for Sherry; he was
gone through the door and upstairs; the door slammed shut and Dad
stood with his back against it.</p>

<p>"S-h-h!" Dad warned her. "We're friends, not enemies! Don't make
a scene!"</p>

<p>Cervanez was half-hysterical. One moment she was threatening to
scratch Dad's eyes out, and the next she was wringing her hands and
running to lower the curtain. But she could not pull the curtain
down so long as Ramon was on the floor; and Ramon was remembering
old acrobatic stunts, compelling the audience to keep their eyes on
him. Papa Pantopoulos was at the far end of the restaurant, near
the door, trying to organize applause as the best way out of the
predicament. If he had run to the stage, about half the audience
would very likely have followed him.</p>

<p>Sherry ran upstairs three steps at a time, and found himself in
an ill- lit passage with doors to the right and left. There was no
sound, although he held his breath and listened until he had to let
his breath out in a sudden gasp. He seized the knob of the nearest
door&mdash;opened it&mdash;drew blank&mdash;a dark
room&mdash;nobody in there. He tried the next one; it was locked on
the inside. He struck the panel three or four times with his
knuckles, and listened again.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Consuelo?"</p>

<p>He would have known that voice in a thousand! But he did not
dare to answer. He rapped with the palm of his hand on the panel
and rattled the knob, hoping that was what Consuelo would do in the
stress of excitement. He heard the key turn cautiously. That was
enough! He burst into the room, shut the door, turned the key
behind him, and stood still.</p>

<p>Jacqueline had jumped backward toward the bed, or his violence
to the door would have knocked her down. She was still wearing the
mask; some instinct of self-preservation had made her retain it,
although she usually threw it off the moment she reached her
room.</p>

<p>"Sherry!" she exclaimed. Her hands went out toward him; yet she
shrank back.</p>

<p>Sherry came on, smiling.</p>

<p>"Sherry! Please!"</p>

<p>She had reached the limit of retreat. Her back was against the
dressing- table. Sherry's right arm closed around her, and she
tried, helplessly, to prevent his other hand from unfastening the
mask. He took it off quite gently, dropped it on the floor, and
looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline, why did you run away from me?" he asked.</p>

<p>But the moment he said the name he saw fear leap into her eyes,
and cursed himself for a clumsy fool. He stooped and picked the
mask up&mdash;held it out to her.</p>

<p>"You know now," she said hopelessly. "Sherry, I've tried so hard
to hide from you."</p>

<p><a id="pic4" name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a>

<br>

<p>He tried to take her into his arms again. "But why?" he asked.
"Why hide from me? Didn't you believe me when I said I love you?
Jacqueline, dear &mdash;that is yo right name, isn't it? You are
Jacqueline Lanier?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sherry. I wish I weren't. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hah!" She looked startled as he barked that laugh at her; and
he stepped into the full heritage of manhood as compassion for her
overcame all other thoughts. His own predicament, his own
desire&mdash;hope&mdash;loneliness was nothing in the overwhelming
awfulness of hers. "I'm glad you are!" he went on. "It gives me a
chance to prove I love you! Bless your darling heart, did you think
it would make any difference who you are, or what they say about
you? Jacqueline dear, look at me again! Look up! D'you think I'm
not telling you the truth? I'm with you to the end of
time&mdash;whatever has happened or whatever may happen. Don't you
remember I promised that?"</p>

<p>"But, Sherry, you hadn't read the papers&mdash;"</p>

<p>He dismissed newspapers and all their universe with an impatient
jerk of his head. "I had seen you, dear!" he answered. "Did you
think I'd believe them after that? Jacqueline! Why&mdash;oh, why
didn't you trust me? I could have saved you so much&mdash;all this,
for instance. I would have stood by you through thick and
thin."</p>

<p>But even then all Jacqueline could shape out of the chaos of
thoughts within her was that Sherry knew. He knew&mdash;and he
still loved her. He didn't believe! But perhaps that was because he
did not really know.</p>

<p>Words came tumbling from her lips, sentences blurted almost
incoherently, her eyes still frightened (for she feared the
worst&mdash;that he would turn when he really did know). She tried
to tell him all the truth at once &mdash;six aspects of it all at
once&mdash;and he only caught the general drift of it. He laughed,
and stopped her with a kiss, taking her into his arms and holding
her so tightly she could hardly breathe.</p>

<p>And in his arms, as he kissed her, all the panic and
hopelessness were stilled. There was peace. Her arms crept around
him. She clung to him. Tears came in a passion of relief; and
through the tears a sob&mdash;almost a whisper; "Sherry&mdash;oh,
Sherry!"</p>

<p>Then memory once more. She drew back startled, thrusting him
away from her.</p>

<p>"Sherry, you mustn't love me! You must never see me again! You
must let me go! I can only do harm&mdash;I'll ruin you! I must
always hide! I couldn't stand it, to have everybody know who I
am&mdash;and have them say such awful things&mdash;and if they knew
you loved me, they'd drag you in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen! Listen!" he said, holding her tightly again.</p>

<p>"Dear, listen to me! They can't hurt me&mdash;and d'you think
I'd care if they did? I'm not going to let them hurt you any more,
that's all!"</p>

<p>He wished he felt as confident of his power to do that as the
words sounded; but he could see the effect of the words on her. At
least if he could not stop the newspapers he could help her to bear
their cruelty.</p>

<p>"You can't escape from me, you know!" he went on. "You're not
going to run away from me again, because there isn't a place you
can go to where I won't follow! I love you, and you can't beat that
game! Bless your heart, if my dad can't or won't straighten out
this newspaper business and put everything right, we'll go to China
or Siam, or some other place where they don't have
newspapers&mdash;and live on canned soup if we have to," he added,
laughing. "Say, Jacqueline&mdash;I love you. Don't you love
me?"</p>

<p>She could not keep from smiling at him through the tears. Love
him? Who wouldn't?</p>

<p>"But, Sherry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you, Jacqueline? You do? Well&mdash;what else matters?"</p>

<p>Nothing else did matter when he held her that way in his arms
and kissed her. The feeling of peace returned.</p>

<p>"You know," he said. "I wasn't joking about canned soup! We'll
be broke to start with! We may have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her answering laugh was what he had been playing for. It brought
her back from the dangerous border of hysteria.</p>

<p>"Sherry, why&mdash;why do you believe in me?" she asked him
suddenly.</p>

<p>"That's easy," he answered. "The question is, do you believe in
me yet?"</p>

<p>She nodded&mdash;met his lips half-way. "Absolutely, dear?"</p>

<p>"Sherry, how could anybody help believing in you?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29">CHAPTER 29.</a><br>
"Meat and drink for him!"</h2>

<p class="first">Cervanez had to leave Dad to lower the curtain;
but then Dad had Ramon on his hands as well as her, and Ramon was
belligerent. His self-esteem was stirred by having saved the day;
he felt like a brave man who has fought in the trenches, and
returns to find treason at the rear. His right hand went naturally
to the dagger-hilt projecting from the sash at his waist; and as
Cervanez poured her tale of woe into his ear he began to stalk Dad
Lawrence, working around in a strategic semicircle toward the far
side of the door, with the obvious intention of rushing Dad and
forcing him away from it toward the stage.</p>

<p>And Dad was no matador&mdash;no duelist&mdash;not even skillful
with his fists. He faced the enemy, but gave ground, retreating
step by step, his eyes on Ramon's. And the farther Dad retreated,
the worse Ramon's eyes glittered, and the more Cervanez egged him
on to "teach that thief a lesson!" Cervanez was in a mood to see
blood. But Ramon was not quite keyed to the point of taking that
tremendous risk; he faced about suddenly, with a movement as
graceful as a matador's avoiding a bull, and disappeared through
the door leading upstairs.</p>

<p>Dad would have followed him, but something else&mdash;definite
and loud &mdash;attracted his attention. He and Cervanez both ran
to the curtain and peered around it, one on either side. The whole
restaurant was in a panic mixed of indignation and assertive
innocence. Women were hiding flasks in their stockings and corsets;
a dozen officers in uniform were filing down both sides of the
room. Dad saw Wahl standing in the entrance beside a prohibition
officer, and the expression on Wahl's mean face would have told the
story even if the police were not already in there. Cervanez ran to
Dad and clutched him by the arms, screaming at him:</p>

<p>"You! What is this? What it mean? You do this?"</p>

<p>"The place is pulled," he answered. "Listen!" His brain was
working like lightning now. He had to defeat Wahl, and that thought
spurred him as nothing else could. "You stay here&mdash;let them
search you but refuse to let them pass! Play for delay! You
understand? It's your only chance!"</p>

<p>He was gone before she could ask him another
question&mdash;upstairs three steps at a time, and hammering at the
only locked door. In the passageway was Ramon, sputtering brimstone
Portuguese.</p>

<p>Dad thrust Ramon aside and beat on the door with his fist.</p>

<p>"Open, Sherry! D'you hear? Open! It's me&mdash;Dad
Lawrence!"</p>

<p>Sherry turned the key and went back to Jacqueline, leaving Dad
to open the door for himself. But Dad found himself thrust aside in
turn; Ramon seized him by both shoulders and whirled him against
the wall&mdash;then flung the door wide open and stood for a moment
magnificently posing on the threshold. Jacqueline was in Sherry's
arms again, and Ramon's brows came down over his eyes like a
thunder-cloud. He said nothing, but his hand went to his knife. Dad
Lawrence sprang too late. Jacqueline smothered a scream. Ramon's
knife went slithering point-first at Sherry's heart.</p>

<p>There was no thought&mdash;no time for it.
Impulse&mdash;instinct &mdash;mother&mdash;readiness to die for
what she loved moved Jacqueline. She pushed at Sherry
suddenly&mdash;thrust him out of the knife's path, and herself into
it. The knife went point-first into her sleeve, and the white stuff
grew crimson. Sherry sprang for Ramon, and Dad cut off his
retreat.</p>

<p>"No!" Jacqueline cried out. "No, Sherry! No! Look, I'm not hurt!
It's only a scratch!"</p>

<p>Dad saw at a glance she was telling the truth and sprang between
Sherry and Ramon&mdash;turned his back to Sherry.</p>

<p>"Look after her!" he shouted over his shoulder. Then to Ramon:
"Now, you dam fool! Get downstairs! Stop the police from coming up
here! If you don't I'll have you pinched for attempted murder! Have
you another knife? There's a man named Wahl down there&mdash;stick
it into him!"</p>

<p>Ramon's fight had all oozed out of him. He obeyed Dad meekly,
trying to pause on the stairs to explain that he had meant to
protect the senorita &mdash;that he had mistaken the gentleman for
a burglar&mdash;that he was sorry&mdash;anything, in fact, but
guilty of jealousy. But Dad threatened to kick him if he did not
hurry downstairs, and Dad's mood was a Viking's in that minute. He
would have carried out his threat. His frenzy would have prevailed
over Ramon's strength, and Ramon knew it&mdash;ran. Dad rushed back
into the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Out of this, Sherry! The place is raided!"</p>

<p>"What do I care?" Sherry answered. He was trying to bandage
Jacqueline's arm with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Dad took hardly even time to nod to Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Get a move on, you young ass! Get out of here! Wahl staged a
raid, and he's here with the bulls! If you're found here, they'll
pinch the two of you. You know what that means! The son of
Mansfield of the Tribune caught in a room with the
notorious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" growled Sherry.</p>

<p>"Damn it, man, I mean it!" Dad exclaimed, shaking his arm.
"There isn't a paper in San Francisco that won't play that up till
they're blue in the face! They'll ribbon head-line it! It'll be the
end of her&mdash;and you too! For your dad's sake, run! Leave me to
look out for her&mdash;I'll stay with her whatever happens.
Sure&mdash;I promise. No, you've no time for kissing &mdash;get a
move on&mdash;scoot! Climb down the fire-escape at the end of the
passage."</p>

<p>Sherry saw the point, and having seen it did not hesitate.</p>

<p>"I'll be out in the street in front," he said.</p>

<p>"Dad&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure!" Dad answered. "Beat it!"</p>

<p>There came a hammering on the door. Sherry opened it and
cannoned into Consuelo. Dad pulled her in, pushed Sherry out, and
locked the door again. Consuelo was in utter panic, too terrified
to speak, gasping at Dad like a choking fish and moving her hands
up and down spasmodically. It was no use talking to her; Dad turned
to Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Listen, little woman," he said as calmly as he could make
himself speak. "We're in a tight fix. This raid has been staged by
Wahl in order to catch you. He wants to identify you, that's all.
He's got his story all written, and it's sure to be worse than
anything he's done yet; the minute he's identified you he'll phone
the Tribune to put the story on the press. He'll have you arrested
if he can. You've got to get out of here before he finds
you&mdash;see? There's only one place I can think of for you to go.
Take this key. I'll find a car, and tell the driver where to take
you. Cover up with shawls&mdash;veils&mdash;anything. Don't be
recognized. We've got to kill that story&mdash;see? Be ready now,
when I come back."</p>

<p>Dad let himself out, and stood listening outside the door. He
could hear a noise coming up from the stage&mdash;voices, and heavy
footsteps&mdash; Cervanez shrilling, reinforced by Ramon&mdash;both
trying to guard the stairway. Suddenly he felt his leg seized and
something jumped on his shoulder from behind, making his blood run
cold. A monkey caught hold of his chin and peered into his face! He
looked down at a curly-headed child in a night-dress, who clung to
his leg and stared up at him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, trying with one hand to keep the monkey
from climbing up on his head.</p>

<p>"Pepita. I want Conchita! I want Conchita! She said she will
come. I want her!"</p>

<p>"You can't see her now," Dad answered.</p>

<p>"Why? I want her! Conchita!"</p>

<p>The child began to cry, screwing fists into her eyes and opening
her mouth to yell. That was altogether too much for Dad's
equanimity. He could not hear a dog yelp without wanting to run to
the rescue. He dug into his pocket, found a coin, and doubled down
beside the child to bring his face on a level with hers.</p>

<p>"Hey-hey-hey! Don't cry. Look here&mdash;take this." Her fingers
closed on half a dollar. "And look, your monkey's pulling my hair!
Won't you take him off!"</p>

<p>"I want Conchita!"</p>

<p>There was a footstep on the stair now. The situation seemed
desperate, but Dad did his best to keep calm.</p>

<p>"She's going away for a few days&mdash;just a few days," he
answered.</p>

<p>"You shall see her when she comes back."</p>

<p>"Where?" the child demanded. "I want to go too!"</p>

<p>"You can't go to the mountains," he answered, and realized too
late that that was a bad mistake. The child began to cry again.</p>

<p>"See here," he said, "if you'll take your monkey, and be a good
girl, and run upstairs to bed, and keep quiet I'll take you to see
Conchita in the mountains."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Soon. Only you must go now! Run! Be off with you!"</p>

<p>Pepita took him at his word, and went, holding the monkey
upside-down and stumbling on the end of her night-dress as she
climbed the stairs. She had hardly gone when the feet of half a
dozen heavy men began tramping upstairs from the stage, and he
heard Wahl's voice.</p>

<p>"Kick open any door you find locked, you men! You'll find
something worth while, I promise you!"</p>

<p>Dad strode to the head of the stair. He reached it, under the
dim gas- jet, just as the leading policeman set his foot on the top
step. He could see Wahl's face in shadow behind the second man.</p>

<p>"Have you a search warrant?" Dad asked.</p>

<p>The front man hesitated, glancing back at the man behind
him.</p>

<p>"Go on, men," said Wahl. "Don't mind him!"</p>

<p>"If you have a search warrant," said Dad, "of course, I've
nothing to say. But if you haven't, you'd better go get one before
you take chances. You know me, I think. If you overstep the law,
the mayor and the district attorney are going to have the facts
before the night's out!"</p>

<p>Wahl came striding up past the policemen, pushing them
aside.</p>

<p>"Say, here, what's this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear?" Dad answered.</p>

<p>"You killing a story?"</p>

<p>"I'm reporting this raid!" said Dad. "You men are simply being
made catspaws!" he called down over Wahl's shoulder to the
policemen. "You'll be the goats if you act illegally. Take my tip
and confine yourselves to the job downstairs&mdash;or go get a
proper warrant. Some of you have known me twenty years. How long
have you known Wahl?"</p>

<p>"You'll know me before I'm through with you!" Wahl growled
savagely. He showed his teeth like a wolf. "You'll know what
hunting a job means, too, Dad Lawrence! Take my word for it!"</p>

<p>But Dad was sure enough already on that score. He knew what
Mansfield senior's instant verdict would be. He was as good as
fired already. Wahl's bolt was shot&mdash;held no more terrors.</p>

<p>"You fellows take the advice of an old friend, and be sensible!"
he called down to the policemen; and some one near the foot of the
stairs said gruffly:</p>

<p>"'Bout face! Downstairs&mdash;march!"</p>

<p>The men tramped down again, but Wahl stood leering savagely with
his face thrust close to Dad's.</p>

<p>"I'll give you one chance!" he sneered.</p>

<p>"Stand by while I force that door in, or I'll break you forever,
as far as any newspaper's concerned!"</p>

<p>"Get to hell out o' here!" Dad answered calmly. "You're a skunk!
Go and make your smell!"</p>

<p>Wahl's laugh, as he turned and followed the police downstairs,
was merciless. It rang like steel struck against stone, sending a
cold chill down Dad's spine. He wondered what the devil would do
next, yet did not dare to wait and see. He knew what he himself had
done, and Wahl had twice his brains; the odds were a thousand to
one that Wahl would try the fire-escape; but there was just an even
chance that if he hurried&mdash;</p>

<p>He led the way to the room at the end of the passage, threw the
window up, and helped Jacqueline out on the fire-escape. Then he
climbed out himself, and fairly hauled Consuelo through after him.
Consuelo wanted to feel her way down carefully, but Dad put one arm
around her and hurried her down as if flames were curling all about
them.</p>

<p>"Never mind if you break your leg! It'll mend!" he protested.
"It's your one chance! Hurry!"</p>

<p>One of the rusted steps broke under Consuelo's weight, but Dad
saved her from falling by main strength. Consuelo cried aloud to
all the saints, but Dad lugged and hauled at her&mdash;the thin
iron trembled&mdash;Jacqueline called encouragingly from
below&mdash;and Consuelo's faith in guardian angels somehow clung
to her as far as the bottom step. But then Jacqueline swung herself
over and dropped like a cat to the ground. Saints&mdash;angels
vanished. Consuelo sat down.</p>

<p>"I'll stay here!" she announced flatly. "Go on! You two go
without me! I don't matter&mdash;they won't get a word out of
me!"</p>

<p>She did not know who "they" were, but she was willing to face
devils rather than that long drop to the ground. However, Dad and
Jacqueline between them managed it. Dad jumped to the ground and
found two garbage cans, one full, the other empty&mdash;piled one
on the other, and laid a piece of wood on top of all. Jacqueline
coaxed, Dad swore, and Consuelo was persuaded; she stepped down,
and the whole structure toppled forward under her trembling weight,
but it broke her fall, and Dad and Jacqueline between them saved
her from breaking her neck.</p>

<p>Then, hand in hand, they hurried up the alley to the street to
find an auto. The police patrol wagon was backed up to the front
entrance of the El Toro, and they were putting Papa Pantopoulos and
several of his waiters into it. Beside the patrol wagon was some
one's private car, and Sherry was talking to a man in a dress suit
and overcoat about half a head taller than himself, a little to one
side, beyond the café entrance. Dad did not look at the man hard
enough to recognize him. He hurried the two women past Sherry, and
got in Sherry's way to prevent him from dallying with
Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Get an auto of some kind&mdash;quick!" he whispered. "We'll
wait at the next corner!"</p>

<p>Dad tugged at the women, for the police were coming out of the
El Toro, and Wahl might follow them. The man Sherry had been
talking to seemed much too interested. Dad did not dare look at
him.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" he urged. "Best foot forward! Keep your faces covered,
and look straight in front of you!"</p>

<p>But that damned young fool Sherry, instead of running for an
auto, was talking to the man again!</p>

<p>"Hell! Is the boy crazy?"</p>

<p>Dad's nerves were nearly as far gone by then as Consuelo's. He
almost jumped out of his skin when a man's step came hurrying
behind him and a man's voice spoke close to his ear.</p>

<p>"Pardon me. Why not use my car?"</p>

<p>Dad faced about&mdash;gasped&mdash;grinned&mdash;recognized John
Miro!</p>

<p>"This is perfectly all right," said Miro, smiling. "They won't
interfere with any lady in my car. Take my arm, Miss Lanier!"</p>

<p>She obeyed, with an almost creepy sensation. It was like walking
with Desmio, only this man was so much taller! He had the same way
of holding her arm, and the same peculiar dignity in his stride.
Strange, what idiotic thoughts occur to one in a crisis. She looked
down at his feet, to see whether he was wearing the rubbers he so
energetically advertised! He was not, and she was almost
disappointed! She had not time to feel surprised at meeting him in
that extraordinary crisis; in fact she was past being surprised at
anything&mdash;and so disturbed on Sherry's account that she could
not think.</p>

<p>Miro helped her into the car&mdash;a great expensive closed one
with the Miro coat-of-arms on the panel; then offered his arm to
Consuelo. Dad whispered to the
chauffeur&mdash;fiercely&mdash;repeating directions again and
again. Miro slammed the door shut, cried "Go ahead!" and stood
between Dad and Sherry, watching as the car threaded its way into
the stream of traffic.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;so here endeth this lesson!" Miro remarked after a
moment.</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't!"</p>

<p>Dad turned and faced him squarely. "That swine Wahl," he went
on, "has his story all written. It's set up, ready to use the
minute he phones them to spring it. What's he doing now? Anybody
seen him?"</p>

<p>Miro did not know Wahl by sight, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"He's still inside there somewhere," said Sherry.</p>

<p>"Damn it! We've got him beat," said Dad, "unless he gets her
story out of Ramon! Maybe he's phoning already from the
cafe&mdash;get in there, Sherry, and see if you can't bust the
instrument&mdash;or cut the wire. I'll hunt for him upstairs. God!
If I catch him in one of the rooms I'll kill him!"</p>

<p>"Don't quite kill him!" advised Miro. "I'll wait here for both
of you."</p>

<p>But Wahl had stolen a march. He was not yet ready to telephone
to the Tribune to use the story. Even he did not dare to turn that
scurrilous concoction loose without first positively identifying
his victim; and he believed she was still hiding upstairs.</p>

<p>He wasted precious minutes trying to find some other way of
invading the upper story, and nearly came to blows with a Negro
cook who drove him headlong out of the kitchen by the back way.
That brought him into the alley, at the rear, and it was not a
minute after that before he thought of the fire-escape. But there
were two fire-escapes; and the one he swung himself on to was at
the end of the building, serving quite a different set of windows
from the one that Dad had used. He peered in vainly at window after
window, almost giving up hope, until he reached the top story and
at last saw a small girl in a night-dress playing with a monkey on
a bedroom floor. Without a moment's hesitation then, he wrapped his
fist in a handkerchief, smashed a pane of glass, unlatched, the
window, and climbed in.</p>

<p>The child ran from him in terror, and Wahl did all he could to
increase the terror, believing that would save time. He caught
her&mdash;backed her up against the wall&mdash;made hideous
grimaces in the child's face.</p>

<p>"Where's Conchita?" he demanded. "Tell me or I'll hurt you!"</p>

<p>"Gone!" wailed Pepita. "She's gone. I want her too! But she's
gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone where? Hurry up now! Tell me, if you don't want to be
hurt!"</p>

<p>"A man came and took her to the mountains. He promised he'd take
me. I want to go soon!"</p>

<p>Pepita burst into tears, and Wahl turned away from her, stroking
his chin.</p>

<p>Mountains&mdash;mountains? The man was Dad Lawrence undoubtedly.
He had felt sure Dad was a traitor, but where would Dad take her,
or send her to in the mountains? It was hardly likely Dad would go
along. He would put her in a car and send her there. Might get the
number of the car&mdash;no, no time for that, and not much chance
of it. Dad must have thought of some place on the spur of the
moment&mdash;what place?&mdash;wished he knew Dad better &mdash;Got
it! Dad had told him he sometimes spent weekends in Mansfield's
cabin, and Mansfield himself hardly ever went there! That must be
the place &mdash;where else? But could he find the way, he
wondered. Well&mdash;he couldn't find it by standing there stroking
his chin. He knew the general direction&mdash;everybody in the
neighborhood would know where Mansfield's cabin was.</p>

<p>He went out by the window just as Dad entered the room in search
for him. Dad, leaning out of the window, watched him hurrying down
the iron ladder &mdash;saw Wahl grin as he recognized the face
above him, and guessed the grin meant triumph. He shut the window
down, and spent five minutes in comforting Pepita before he could
coax the account from her of what Wahl had said and done, and what
she had told Wahl. Then he tossed the child on to the bed, covered
her, kissed her good night, and ran for it&mdash;downstairs
&mdash;as hard as he could lay foot to the floor. He found Sherry
by the phone booth.</p>

<p>"Where's your car?" Dad demanded.</p>

<p>"In the garage. Haven't used it since yesterday."</p>

<p>"Take a taxi, and go get it, quick! Wahl's wise! He's after
her&mdash;to your dad's cabin in the mountains! Get on his trail!
Smash him if you have to! Use a monkey-wrench! Anything to stop
him! If he identifies her&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Sherry was gone. Wahl's roadster, in which he had followed
the police patrol wagon on the way to the raid, had been parked
half a block away. That was gone too.</p>

<p>"It's a race now&mdash;up to Sherry and a high-powered car,"
said Dad, joining Miro on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Race for what?" asked Miro. "What next?"</p>

<p>Dad enlightened him. "If Wahl phones the Tribune to spring that
story, tomorrow's first edition will about kill that girl! The
story's all in type. One word from him, and it's on the press! All
the other papers will copy it, and the evening editions will
enlarge on it! Mansfield's sure to put it on the wires, and every
paper in the country will run columns about it! She'll never be
able to live it down."</p>

<p>"No," said Miro calmly, "she won't. I know what publicity
means!" He glanced up at his own glaring sky-sign several blocks
away. "Let's see: I use a lot of space in the Tribune. I've phoned
for my other car&mdash;it'll be here in a few minutes&mdash;I'll go
and see Mr. Mansfield!"</p>

<p>Dad touched his arm. "Be careful!" he warned: "Mansfield's iron!
Threats only make him savage."</p>

<p>Miro smiled. "He won't care to lose any full-page
advertising."</p>

<p>"Meat and drink for him!" Dad answered. "He'll leave the space
blank, and run a paragraph in big type in the middle explaining why
you canceled your ad! He's fought and won that kind of fight a
dozen times."</p>

<p>"Where's the joint in his armor them" asked Miro&mdash;almost
pleasantly &mdash;the way a surgeon might ask to see a patient's
leg.</p>

<p>"Sherry!" Dad answered. "Mansfield wants to break Miss Lanier
because he suspects Sherry of being under her influence. Sherry has
as much iron as his father, and won't quit. Mansfield will cut
Sherry off without a nickel."</p>

<p>"And you?" asked Miro.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm done for! I'll be hunting a job tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"Try me first," suggested Miro. "Here's my car. Well&mdash;glad
to have met you, Mr.&mdash;what name?&mdash;Lawrence. And this
place in the mountains&mdash;just where is it?"</p>

<p>"Mansfield's cabin."</p>

<p>"Oh he'll know the way then. Good night. Don't forget to come to
see me. And before I forget it will you do me a favor? Phone the
Ursuline Convent &mdash;get Sister Michaela&mdash;tell her where
Jacqueline is and have a car put at her disposal. Send me the
bill." He saw Dad's bewilderment. "That's just in case the rest of
us fall down.&mdash;Good night."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30">CHAPTER 30.</a><br>
"I've heard threats before&mdash;lots of 'em!"</h2>

<p class="first">At seventeen moods flash from one extreme to the
other, and Jacqueline in John Miro's limousine behind a liveried
driver was a totally different person from La Conchita in a shabby
cabaret. She began instantly to readjust herself to the new
surroundings, and to think in corresponding terms. Noblesse oblige.
That is almost the only age-worn proverb that can not be
controverted. The other is, "Put a beggar on a horse and he will
ride you down."</p>

<p>Hedged in by elegance, and safe for the moment, she thought of
nothing but Sherry and how to save him from the disaster of being
mixed up with herself. She was willing to make any sacrifice for
Sherry&mdash;but what sacrifice would help? There was no prospect
now that Sherry would listen to reason and drop her out of his
life; she knew he would stick to her through thick and thin,
quarrel with his father, and be ruined&mdash;by what? By his own
father's newspaper's lies about herself! And reporters were
probably already hunting like wolves to discover who the man was
who had been in her bedroom, because she had no doubt but that
Ramon was already talking.</p>

<p>Who would help? To whom could she turn? Dad Lawrence had been an
angel, but what more could he do? John Miro had turned up like a
person in a dream, and had helped by lending his car. She supposed
he was awfully rich, but &mdash;he was just a gentleman, behaving
as such&mdash;he could hardly have refused the loan of his
car&mdash;he and Desmio had been at daggers drawn&mdash;but Desmio
would certainly have done as much for John Miro &mdash;it was no
use looking to John Miro for any further, aid&mdash; besides, he
would certainly think she had plotted to deprive him of the Miro
estates in Louisiana. He very likely believed the newspapers and
that Desmio's death was her fault. Why should he not believe the
newspapers? Everybody always did.</p>

<p>She almost wished she had stayed and confronted Wahl. If she
told him the plain truth, wouldn't he listen? She knew he would not
listen! She remembered Wahl's face&mdash;and his hand on her
wrist&mdash;knew, too, that she could never force herself to say a
word to him; even the memory of him made her feel cold all
over.</p>

<p>How did any one come to believe what such a person as Wahl said,
she wondered. Why did the people who owned the newspapers place any
confidence in him? Why did Sherry's father trust him? Oh, if only
she could see Sherry's father, and tell him the truth for one
minute, she felt sure she could convince him! She would warn him of
Sherry's danger.</p>

<p>Why not? Was he invisible? Was she afraid? Yes! Of
what&mdash;for herself? Yes! What did that matter? She owed it to
Sherry! What was love for if you didn't sacrifice yourself to save
the man you loved?</p>

<p>She nudged Consuelo. "Tell him to stop!" she commanded. But
Consuelo had no mind for anything but flight&mdash;and the luxury
of being in a limousine again.</p>

<p>"No, no, honey&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jacqueline leaned forward and slid the glass partition.</p>

<p>"Drive first to the Tribune Building!" she commanded, and the
man swung the car around obediently. The die was cast!</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do, honey? Are you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never you mind. You wait in the car while I attend to
something."</p>

<p>Firm lips&mdash;eyes full of conquest&mdash;seat
erect&mdash;courage. She wished she knew beforehand what a
newspaper office was like. She imagined Mansfield senior in a den
between whirring machinery and oil-cans, and supposed she would
have to shout her loudest in order to make him hear above the
clatter. Well&mdash;it would help if she had to shout; she would
yell the truth at him, and all his men would hear, and would be
convinced too! She had a vision of a dozen men in overalls crowding
around Mansfield senior and forcing him to withdraw his accusations
against her&mdash;forcing him to print a special edition
exonerating her&mdash;and of Mansfield begging her pardon, just as
Sherry would beg anybody's pardon, bluntly, almost rudely, but with
absolute sincerity! If they did find out that Sherry had been in
her room, it wouldn't matter, if only all the newspapers withdrew
all those awful lies about her!</p>

<p>She saw Mansfield senior as a big bloated copy of Sherry, with
his coat off and his sleeves rolled up, and one hand on a wheel
that controlled all the machinery.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, there she was in front of the Tribune Building,
with her heart in her mouth, and all the inspiration gone! Consuelo
begged and implored her not to do anything foolish, but the driver
got down and held the door open, which kept her from changing her
mind if nothing else did. She wrapped the heavy veil twice around
the lower part of her face, jumped out before Consuelo could stop
her, and ran into the building.</p>

<p>She thought at first she had made a mistake; it was not in the
least like the newspaper den she had imagined&mdash;just a great
gilded hallway, with well-dressed people hurrying to and fro. But a
man in uniform told her which floor to go to, and showed her into
the elevator; in another moment she had stepped into a corridor
with doors to right and left and a desk at one corner, at which a
pale-faced boy sat behind a piece of painted wood marked
"Information." She supposed that meant that the boy would tell her
things.</p>

<p>But it was he who insisted on information. He wanted to know her
name and business. Had she a card? Would she write her name then on
a slip of paper? When she shook her head the boy grew impudent, and
that settled that problem. He learned, at once, at least something
about dignity.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Mansfield that a lady is waiting to see him."</p>

<p>The boy looked at her and left his desk. A moment later he bowed
her in through Mansfield's office door, and Mansfield senior rose
from his leather- covered chair, as she stood hesitating while the
door clicked behind her.</p>

<p>It was all so different from what she had imagined that she
could not speak at all at first. Mansfield looked something, though
not much, like Sherry, and was as well dressed as any man she had
ever seen. The office was almost like a private library, with a
fireplace, arm-chairs and an expensive carpet. There was no noise.
Mansfield remained standing at his desk and seemed to expect her to
speak first, and to be very suspicious.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Mansfield?" she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>He nodded, and she walked half a dozen steps toward him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wanted to talk to you about&mdash;about something."
His expression showed that he supposed that was why she was there;
it was dry &mdash;hard&mdash;uncompromising. He did not make the
slightest effort to put her at her ease.</p>

<p>"About what?" he asked after a moment's pause; and the very
abruptness of the question nerved her to the fighting point.</p>

<p>"About your newspaper, Mr. Mansfield, and about untruths you've
printed, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>There! It was out! But instead of looking startled, Mansfield
smiled dryly and motioned her to a chair. "Won't you remove your
veil?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, thank you. You've printed disgraceful accounts of
Jacqueline Lanier," she went on, "and I happen to know they are
absolutely false. I've come to tell you that, so that anything you
print from now on will be done with your eyes open. You've ruined
Jacqueline Lanier&mdash;ruined her life and all her hopes. You've
blackened her character, without knowing anything about the real
circumstances and you've reduced her to the point where she simply
can't face people&mdash;where she is afraid to let people know who
she is, because of the things the newspapers have said of her."</p>

<p>Jacqueline paused for breath. Mansfield again motioned her to a
chair, but she continued standing, so he leaned back against his
desk and stood at ease.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline Lanier is one of those evil characters who should be
exposed, in the public interest," he answered sternly. "We have all
the facts about her. Our special correspondent was present at the
tragedy that made her notorious. He interviewed her. His
impressions and his information are first hand."</p>

<p>"He knows nothing!" she retorted. "You've let that&mdash;that
devil destroy a girl's character, and&mdash;you've worse than
murdered her! She's forced to run away and hide&mdash;and now
you're trying to kill her all over again!"</p>

<p>"It is not our fault that she deserves to be pilloried,"
Mansfield answered calmly. "This newspaper owes a duty to the
public. However&mdash; pardon me&mdash;how do you know of our
intentions?"</p>

<p>"Never mind! I know! Your reporters are after her. You're going
to print another story about her, and I'm here to ask you not to do
it!"</p>

<p>Mansfield smiled again. He made no comment, except that his eyes
hardened and grew a fraction less wide open as he watched her. He
picked up a paper- knife from the desk behind him and began to play
with it.</p>

<p>"Is that blood on your dress?" he asked her suddenly.</p>

<p>Too late, she remembered that her cape had no button in front,
and clutched it. "It's nothing&mdash;only a scratch," she answered,
but she saw renewed suspicion in his eyes.</p>

<p>That frown of hers was dancing restlessly, belying indignation,
making her look mischievous, and the effect of that was heightened
by the veil that she was so careful to keep over her mouth. The
veil rather muffled her voice; and the fact that she had on a
spangled dancing dress under a cheap cape was decidedly not in her
favor. If she had only covered her forehead instead of her chin,
those lake-blue eyes might have convinced.</p>

<p>"How do you come to know Jacqueline Lanier?" Mansfield asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I do know her!" she answered. "Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "You forget that we know her!" he
answered.</p>

<p>"You don't, Mr. Mansfield! She's&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted with a gesture. "Let me prove to you that we do,"
he broke in. "Don't hesitate to tell me if I'm wrong. She is
dancing, and has been dancing for several nights past, in a lowdown
cabaret called the El Toro, owned by a Greek of unsavory repute.
She is living in the company of disreputable foreigners, and
dancing in a mask. That, of itself, is evidence of her real
character. People have a way of finding their true level, whatever
the circumstances of their birth may happen to be. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see that she's there because you've left her nothing
else to do, and nowhere to go? Are you going to deprive her of even
that poor chance to make a living?"</p>

<p>"It is part of a newspaper's business to expose people of her
type," Mansfield answered, studying that dancing frown with
increasing dislike. "Left to her own devices that girl would very
soon repeat past performances. She would ruin more young
men&mdash;and possibly more old ones. She is a public
menace&mdash;a type of the greatest public menace in the world
today, only she happens to be worse than most of them. Pity would
be wasted on her. What pity had she for the man who went to his
death on her account, and for poor Jack Calhoun, who shot himself?
She laughed! Our correspondent saw her!"</p>

<p>She did not, Mr. Mansfield!"</p>

<p>"How do you know? Were you there?" he asked.</p>

<p>Jacqueline hesitated, and the fact did not escape Mansfield's
notice. She was wondering whether to admit who she was, but the
hard look in his eyes warned her that would be worse than useless.
She tried another line.</p>

<p>"Haven't you a son?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes. What has that to do with it?" he snapped back.</p>

<p>"Would you like your son to be found guilty by the newspapers,
and condemned, and hounded from pillar to post&mdash;until there
was almost nothing left but suicide?"</p>

<p>Her voice almost broke as she said that, but Mansfield snorted
and sat down at his desk. He had no intention of being won over by
sob-stuff, nor of letting the interview drag out much longer. His
eye was on the button at the end of the row on the wall; unless she
had something more to the point to tell him, in another minute he
would ring the bell and have her shown out. She read his intention,
but she was there to save Sherry, and her next words made him sit
upright and stare at her again.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Mansfield. You have ruined Jacqueline&mdash;you
can't hurt her any more. But do you realize that you've made her so
notorious that any man would be ruined, too, whose name was mixed
up with hers?"</p>

<p>"That's his look-out!" Mansfield answered cynically.</p>

<p>"Listen, Mr. Mansfield. Your reporters&mdash;or one of
them&mdash;caused the El Toro to be raided. There was an
accident."</p>

<p>Mansfield raised his eyebrows. He thought of the blood he had
noticed on her dress, and nodded.</p>

<p>"There was some one in La Conchita's room&mdash;a young
man."</p>

<p>"A man, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And please, Mr. Mansfield, if there's any mercy or justice
in you, call off your reporters. Don't let them find out who it
was. If they do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Serve him right!" snapped Mansfield.</p>

<p>Gesture&mdash;expression&mdash;attitude&mdash;finger ready for
the bell&mdash;all indicated that the interview had no further
possible purpose as far as he was concerned. But he did not press
the bell-button; something in Jacqueline's manner arrested him. She
had grown calm suddenly; the effect was much more tragic than if
she had pointed a finger and screamed at him.</p>

<p>"The man was your son, Mr. Mansfield!" she said quietly.</p>

<p>He was stung! He gaped at her. But then his face began to grow
harder than a stone.</p>

<p>"I am here to save your son," she went on.</p>

<p>"I'll save him!" he said suddenly, and grabbed at the desk
telephone. "I'll let no woman of that type ruin him! Give me the
desk!" he shouted. "Quick! Have every story that comes in about the
raid at the El Toro sent to me first. D'you get that? Print nothing
until I've seen it!"</p>

<p>"If that's all you came about, you needn't worry," he sneered.
"We'll keep his name out of it!"</p>

<p>"And hound her?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>Well&mdash;she had saved Sherry. But divine rage&mdash;reckless,
righteous anger seized Jacqueline. Suddenly she saw the smallness
of this man &mdash;his meanness&mdash;his cowardice. Scorn arose in
her and swamped every other sensation.</p>

<p>"You miserable coward!" she exclaimed, not raising her voice,
but looking at him as if he were a Negro. "So your notions of
public duty don't include yourself or your son! You contemptible
creature! Sherry is worth ten million of you, or I would go myself
and tell his name to every newspaper in the city! Don't dare answer
me! Listen! You have heard the truth tonight! If Jacqueline Lanier
were all that you say she is, then you're worse! But she's nothing
of the sort, and you're worse than a murderer&mdash;you're a yellow
coward, and a liar! That's all, Mr. Mansfield! You may ring your
bell now!"</p>

<p>She turned her back to him and waited for the office-boy to show
her out, not once looking back at him, and for a moment Mansfield
sat still, not enjoying his sensations. It was the first time in
his life that any one had dared to say to his face anything
remotely resembling Jacqueline's words, and what appalled him was
her impudence, not his own injustice. To be bearded in his own den
and called a liar by&mdash;by that creature! For he knew who she
was now&mdash;hadn't the slightest doubt of it. She was La Conchita
&mdash;none other than Jacqueline Lanier&mdash;the female who had
vamped Sherry and cast a spell on him&mdash;here in his office to
save herself by a hypocritical pretense of pleading for the boy! He
grabbed the telephone.</p>

<p>"O.K. that Lanier story!" he almost shouted. "I've identified
her! Rush it through&mdash;and say: send some one from the
news-room quick, to follow that woman downstairs. She's just gone
down in the elevator&mdash;it's the Lanier in
person&mdash;sure!&mdash;trace her&mdash;have him hurry!"</p>

<p>But Jacqueline was into Miro's limousine, and away, before the
reporter ran out of the building, and all the news he brought back
was that some one had told him she drove away in an expensive
closed car.</p>

<p>"Ham!" said Mansfield. "Another old man on the string, I dare
say. She seems to like two at a time&mdash;an old one and a young
one! I wonder where Wahl is all this time&mdash;he ought to play
that up."</p>

<p>About ten minutes later he was rather annoyed than otherwise to
learn that John Miro had called, and wished to speak with him.
Normally he would have been glad to talk with Miro, as an
advertiser nationally known, with whom it was good business to be
on friendly terms. He had never met him, and would like to. But
just now he wanted to keep his mind on the Lanier story, and to
watch for any angle of it that might implicate Sherry. Also he
wanted to consider what to say to Sherry&mdash;how to discipline
him without arriving at an open quarrel. So, though he received
Miro graciously enough, he told him he could only spare five
minutes.</p>

<p>"Time's always scant about the time we're going to press," he
explained.</p>

<p>"So I judge, by the way the stuff's written," Miro answered,
smiling amiably as he took the proffered arm-chair and crossed one
leg over the other. "If I rushed into print with my advertisements
as casually as you print news, I'd be bankrupt or in jail within
the month. Will you have a cigar?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," snapped Mansfield. "What is it I can do for
you?"</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I light one?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Go ahead. But please come to the point&mdash;I'm
rushed off my feet."</p>

<p>"You're going to be rushed a great deal faster presently," said
Miro, carefully cutting the end from a cigar and lighting it. "I've
a car outside that can catch its own shadow. How are the roads
toward the mountains&mdash; pretty good?"</p>

<p>"I wonder what you mean?" asked Mansfield, staring at him.</p>

<p>"I know you do."</p>

<p>"The point&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Is this," said Miro. "When you make mistakes, are you big
enough to retract them? Or are you one of those big I Am's, who
have to have it proved to them how small they really are?"</p>

<p>"What the hell d'you mean?" demanded Mansfield, growing angry.
"Is there anything wrong with your copy? If so, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. That all emanates from my office, and is checked up
very carefully."</p>

<p>"Then what the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am coming to that."</p>

<p>"Then I wish you'd be quicker about it!"</p>

<p>"We will what they call 'step on her' presently," said Miro
suavely. "I occasionally read your paper."</p>

<p>Mansfield's expression softened a little. He was always ready to
talk about the Tribune.</p>

<p>"The advertisements are now and then excellent," Miro went
on&mdash; apparently deadly serious now.</p>

<p>"We're the greatest advertising medium on the West Coast," said
Mansfield.</p>

<p>"Yes. Many of your advertisers tell the truth. They make sure of
their facts, I suspect, before asking for other people's money. It
occurred to me to ask you why you don't consider taking a feather
out of their cap."</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>Mansfield had a hand on each arm of his chair, and his feet were
under him, as if he were ready to spring up and fight.</p>

<p>"Miss Jacqueline Lanier is the particular instance I have in
mind," said Miro, just as suavely as ever, leaning back, blowing
smoke rings&mdash; nevertheless, watching Mansfield with a pair of
very bright brown eyes.</p>

<p>Mansfield struck his fist on the desk. "There," he exclaimed, "I
have you! There was never a case in which we were more certain of
our facts!"</p>

<p>"And never a case where you perpetrated a more rank injustice,"
Miro answered calmly. "Who supplied your facts?"</p>

<p>Mansfield ignored the question.</p>

<p>"Injustice? Where's the injustice in exposing a woman of that
type? She's a public menace! You're the last man who should uphold
her! She as good as murdered a relative of yours. She's the type
that breaks up families,&mdash; disorganizes society&mdash;ruins
the lives of young men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's a good, sweet, honest little woman, beautifully bred and
delicately poised," said Miro, "and you've turned her into a poor
little soiled bird caught in the lime."</p>

<p>"Why pick on me?" demanded Mansfield. "The Tribune isn't the
only paper that has printed her story."</p>

<p>"I pick on you because you're handy, and one of the worst
offenders," Miro retorted calmly. "The cheaper rags will copy you.
Is that clear?"</p>

<p>Mansfield jerked his drawer open. "See here!" he snapped.
"Here's a wire in this afternoon. Another scalp on her belt. Donna
Isabella&mdash;dead of a broken heart!"</p>

<p>"And in hell&mdash;I suspect," added Miro. "I was at Don Andres'
funeral, although I noticed your reporters overlooked the fact. I
had an interview with Donna Isabella. I shall not attend hers." He
uncrossed his legs, and laid his gloves and hat down very carefully
on the floor before he went on. "The funeral of the Tribune is the
next that I propose to attend &mdash;unless you and I arrive at an
understanding before I leave this office!"</p>

<p>"Hah!" Mansfield jumped from his chair with every fighting
instinct uppermost. "Is that the lay of the land? Cancel your
advertising! Good! Just put it in writing!"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Miro answered calmly. "You will carry my
advertising as long as your newspaper has a leg to stand on. The
contract has nearly a year to run, and I have an option to renew at
the same rates."</p>

<p>"Then what's your game?" snapped Mansfield.</p>

<p>"I'm not playing any game. I'm deadly serious," Miro answered.
"I propose to confront you with actual facts."</p>

<p>"Facts? I know all about her!" Mansfield snorted.</p>

<p>"More than you'd ever guess! She's been dancing in a low-down
cabaret known as the El Toro, and was caught red-handed
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself. He was not going to implicate Sherry, even
in order to confound this man.</p>

<p>"I know all about that," Miro answered, smiling. "I know the
name of the young man who was in her bedroom. I have had some of
the brightest young men from my office hunting for Jacqueline
Lanier for several days. Two of them, working independently,
identified her this evening, and I arrived on the scene just as
that raid was pulled off. You, may say&mdash;if you like &mdash;in
your paper that I assisted to rescue her. It was then hardly half
an hour ago&mdash;that I made up my mind to fight you to your
knees."</p>

<p>"You? Fight me?" demanded Mansfield.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Miro answered. "It will be the sort of public duty
that I dote on. I suspect that I own about twenty-five or thirty
dollars to your one. I have no family&mdash;no heirs whom I care to
leave money to. And nothing in the world appeals to me half as much
as smashing a public nuisance like your newspaper. There will be
libel suits, of course; and you will inevitably lose them; but
those will be no more than a preliminary skirmish."</p>

<p>"You mean, you propose to dictate to me what the Tribune shall
print &mdash;whom it shall attack, and whom let alone?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I should find that very uninteresting, and I hate
above all things to be bored. I propose either to force you to
reapproach this whole subject of Jacqueline Lanier with an open
mind, and to retract in full &mdash;and handsomely&mdash;whatever
mistakes I may convince you you have made&mdash;or else to smash
you so completely that you will never raise your head again. I
shall also, of course, be at great pains to let the public know why
you were smashed."</p>

<p>"Go to it!" snapped Mansfield. "I've heard threats
before&mdash;lots of 'em!"</p>

<p>"My first step will be to give the true story tonight to all the
other newspapers&mdash;including the name of your son," said Miro.
"The other newspapers are just as sensational as yours, and they'll
revel in it, but they'll be supplied with proofs&mdash;which
your&mdash;ah&mdash;special correspondent overlooked. They will
also be permitted an interview with Miss Lanier. It will make great
news, won't it, that your son has&mdash;ah &mdash;taken the part of
the lady whom you persist in vilifying!"</p>

<p>Mansfield was ready with a retort, but checked it. He was stung.
He knew the other newspapers would harp on that string mercilessly.
Hating him &mdash;jealous of his mounting circulation&mdash;they
would pounce on the opportunity.</p>

<p>"What are these facts and proofs that you hope to convince me
with?" he demanded, and Miro carefully smoothed out a smile.</p>

<p>"I propose, first of all, that you shall come with me and meet
Miss Lanier in person," he answered.</p>

<p>"Useless!" snapped Mansfield. "I've met her! She left this room
ten minutes before you entered! I had a long talk with her. She
convinced me she's a bad lot!"</p>

<p>That statement rather took the wind out of Miro's sails. He
began to gather up his hat and gloves, but he managed to mask his
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "I've had a most delightful interview. I
always like to discover a man's weaknesses before I fight him!
Thanks for the&mdash;ah &mdash;intelligence, the armies call it.
Good night."</p>

<p>He was striding for the door, when it opened and Dad Lawrence
burst in, breathless, nodding to Miro and trying to force himself
to feel and look calm.</p>

<p>"I just came in to say I'm through," he explained. "I won't wait
to be fired. Thought I'd warn you that Wahl's on his way to your
cabin after Jacqueline Lanier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My cabin! Who sent her there?"</p>

<p>"I did. I gave her the key!&mdash;and Sherry's in his own car
hellbent after Wahl. He'll catch him, sure. I doubt if Wahl knows
the way, and Sherry's sure to overtake him. There'll be a fight. It
seemed a good idea to let you know it."</p>

<p>John Miro stood with his hand on the door-knob, smiling. "Don't
you think Sherry will win?" he asked, watching Mansfield's face,
which was a picture of all the violent emotions.</p>

<p>Mansfield snatched at the desk telephone. "My car!" he yelled.
"Order it round in front&mdash;rush!"</p>

<p>"Why not mine?" asked Miro. "Yours is probably as unreliable as
the news you print! Mine's waiting."</p>

<p>Mansfield snatched up the telephone again. "Cancel that!" he
yelled. "I've another car!&mdash;Come, then!" he snapped at Miro.
"What are we waiting for?"</p>

<p>"Only for Mr. Lawrence. Aren't you coming?" Miro asked; and Dad,
nothing loath, hurried behind them into the elevator.</p>

<p>In less than two minutes they were scooting through the traffic
like a fire-engine answering a fourth alarm&mdash;Mansfield with
his hat off, in order that the traffic-cops might recognize him,
and let them by.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31">CHAPTER 31.</a><br>
"The devil&mdash;half-roasted!"</h2>

<p class="first">It cost Sherry exactly twenty minutes to cross
town to the garage where he kept his own car, to put in gas and to
be under way again. But Wahl lost fifteen minutes asking for
directions and procuring a road map; and Sherry's car could
overhaul Wahl's cheap roadster at the rate of almost two to one.
Nothing but traffic and the speed-laws made a real race of it, but
the luck was with Wahl from the start; perhaps because his car
looked incapable of high speed, he slipped away unnoticed, whereas
Sherry was held up twice in the first ten miles and served with
notice to appear before the judge; each of those interludes cost
him several minutes.</p>

<p>Thereafter Sherry "stepped on her" in real earnest. But the luck
was still with Wahl. A bent nail punctured one of Sherry's rear
tires, and he lost six more minutes changing rims&mdash;made clumsy
by darkness and his own impatience. By the time he had finished
that job he knew by consulting his watch and figuring the mileage
that it was a serious question whether he could catch Wahl before
he reached the Mansfield cabin; the last twenty miles would be
rough going over narrow dirt roads, on which high speed would be
impossible. To make matters worse, he began to drive into a
fog.</p>

<p>But that was not so good for Wahl's prospects as might
appear.</p>

<p>Like father, like son; Sherry Mansfield was a fighter, the main
difference being that Sherry had more compunctions to begin with.
Once determined to fight, Sherry would have to be knocked out and
killed before the other side could safely claim a victory. And he
was no bull-headed combatant, however keen; he used every ounce of
energy the engine could be made to give and took all chances at
curves and corners, but the back of his mind was busy planning what
to do to Wahl in the likely event of his failing to overtake
him.</p>

<p>One thing he knew he would do. If Wahl should reach cabin ahead
of him, he would stop and cut the telephone wire somewhere on the
last half-mile where it was looped from tree to tree beside the
track. Then, though Wahl might identify Jacqueline, he could not
phone the information to the Tribune. And after that:</p>

<p>"Well: I'll beat him up, that's all! He's yellow. His sort
always are. I bet I can lick the enthusiasm out of him!"</p>

<p>But Wahl's enthusiasm was of a type beyond Sherry's
comprehension. The lone hunt suited him perfectly. He liked the
fog; it made it difficult. He preferred things the way they
were&mdash;would not have missed that chase into the mountains for
a month's pay. It turned the story into an epic. As he drove, his
brain shaped headlines&mdash;coining phrases, with which to slander
his victim without risk of libel suits.</p>

<p>"Lanier girl hiding in the mountains!&mdash;No, that's not
strong enough. Lanier girl takes to the woods&mdash;that's better!
Sub-head&mdash;caught in police net, slips through the fog and is
brought to bay by Tribune reporter! That's a good one! Gee! I'll
get a story from her! I'll scare the living lights out of her!
Taken in Mansfield's cabin of all places! We'll have to alibi
that&mdash;cabin in the mountains is enough&mdash;nobody's business
whose cabin it was. Soon as I've identified her positively, I'll
phone the Tribune to O.K. what I've written, and then dictate 'em a
follow-up over the wire. Hope it isn't one of those cursed party
lines. That's not likely, though. Mansfield's sure to have had a
private wire put in."</p>

<p>He had a keen sense of direction, sharpened by long experience
in hunting down elusive victims of his pen. He drove with a road
map pinned open on his knees, where he could just see it in the
faint light from the dashboard, and he took the right turnings at
top speed in the dark and the thickening mist with an almost
unerring instinct, only slowing three or four times to read
signboards by the way&mdash;until at last, near midnight, he came
to a sandy road marked deeply by the wheels of one car, and only
one, that had gone up recently. Then he knew he was on the right
scent, and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>There was a man standing in the dark near that corner, who heard
the laugh, and talked of it for many days afterward.</p>

<p>Wahl had no more sense of duty than the hound that hunts a
leveret&mdash; or the wolf at the heels of a doe. His mind had
pictured Jacqueline as something to destroy. The harder she fought
for seclusion, the keener his zest to unearth her and strip her
naked with his brain and pen. That was what life consisted in. For
what was talent, if you did not use it? The public was not his
taskmaster, it was his audience, that it delighted him to entertain
&mdash;his paymaster, yes; the donor of rewards, yes; contributor
of applause, as was fitting. In one sense Wahl was an amateur; he
craved the laurels far more than his pay. As a man runs a race, he
strove to outdo all competitors with the meaty, juicy scandals he
brought to light, and colored with the touch of genius.</p>

<p>He felt more satisfaction in rounding up Jacqueline, and
bringing her to bay as he intended to describe it, than some men
would feel in winning thousands on a horse-race. If there had been
no cruelty in his performance, two-thirds of the zest would have
been gone.</p>

<p>"Take off the law, and there'd be bull-fights in a week, playing
to standing room only. The public wants to see 'em suffer!
Nine-tenths of slumming's for the sake of the thrill they get out
of seeing kids go hungry! Hell&mdash;I know the public. I've got a
good one for 'em this time! Let's hope she makes a scene and tries
to scratch my eyes out! What sells newspapers is what sells
books&mdash;Gibbon, for instance&mdash;Rabelais &mdash;accounts of
women and children torn in the arena&mdash;salacious
stuff&mdash;and the censorship makes it easier&mdash;you can
suggest things without saying 'em&mdash;tickle
imagination&mdash;and ho! watch the public gloat!"</p>

<p>He neither worshiped nor despised the public, any more than a
hyena does the other ghouls that it consorts with. Morals did not
enter into it; he had no conception of them, other than as
standards used by the public for destroying other people. He prided
himself, on always having taken good care to have a thoroughly
sound moral basis from which to attack his victims.</p>

<p>"But lord! I never had such a good one as this. She's perfect!
Brains enough to be a red-hot vamp, and not enough sense to be a
hypocrite! Didn't even shed crocodile's tears, with two lovers shot
dead in her own bedroom! She's a hot one! Damn this road! Are we
never going to get there?"</p>

<p>The sandy track had narrowed until there was room for only one
car, and a high bank on the right shut off the moonlight. As he
followed a curve rather warily up a steep incline Wahl's lights
projected at a tangent from the road, their milky whiteness lost
among rocks and trees. He leaned forward close to the windshield,
keeping his eyes on the edge of the track at the left, slowing more
and more, feeling his way&mdash;when suddenly his eyes were blinded
by the fierce lights of Miro's returning limousine coming downhill
noiselessly, following its own ruts in the sand, its driver taking
the curve at thirty miles an hour without a suspicion that any
other car would be on that road at that hour.</p>

<p>Wahl tried to sound his horn, but it did not answer the button.
There was just time&mdash;possibly just room if he hugged the
outside edge. But the wheels held in the rut; he had to use all his
strength and step hard on the gas to force the car out of them. He
cried out, but the cry was drowned in the din of his own racing
engine and as the car jumped clear of the ruts the edge of the soft
bank yielded under the sudden weight. The limousine purred by,
untouched, before Wahl felt the roadster capsizing and tried to
jump to save himself. He was half out of the car and half in it
when it turned completely over and pinned him by the shoulders
face-downward among grass and leaves. He struggled for a minute,
yelling for help and then lay still.</p>

<p>A mile lower down Sherry Mansfield halted the limousine by
waiting in mid- track for it with his lights pointing straight
uphill. Yes; the driver had delivered the lady and her companion
safely. He had opened up the cabin, built a fire on the hearth for
the visitors and had come away. Yes, they were all right; yes, he
had passed another car on his way back&mdash;had nearly collided
with it.</p>

<p>Sherry pulled out to let him pass, and drove like fury uphill.
If he could not overtake Wahl&mdash;but he must! If Wahl identified
her, and could use the telephone, that cursed story would be on
every breakfast-table. He would kill Wahl first!</p>

<p>But he was driving dead-slow because of the sand at a turn when
he saw dancing flame through the fog to his left about twenty feet
below the track. He would have passed, believing it a forest fire,
only he suddenly remembered it was not the time of year for those,
and stared again. The outline of a pair of wheels in air was
unmistakable. It was a burning auto, and he got out to
investigate.</p>

<p>In less than a minute he discovered Wahl, pinned under the side
of the car, breathing, but unconscious and beginning to be scorched
by the heat of the burning gasoline.</p>

<p>"Let him burn! Serve him right! That's what he'll get in hell!"
Sherry muttered to himself, and tried at once to lift the car off
Wahl's shoulders. But he could not move it, and the heat drove him
off. He rushed into the fog searching for a pole of some
sort&mdash;found one&mdash;shoved it under the car&mdash;lifted it
six inches&mdash;rested the end of the pole on his
shoulders&mdash;and dragged Wahl clear.</p>

<p>"Now leave him here to rot, damn him!"</p>

<p>He picked Wahl up, and carried him up the bank staggering under
the weight and swearing each time he caught his breath.</p>

<p>"Lie there, you swine, while I turn the car around, I'll dump
you at the first house on the road to Frisco, and I hope you
die!"</p>

<p>He stooped to look at Wahl&mdash;switched on his search-light,
and looked again.</p>

<p>"Dying, I guess. Dad-blame the luck! The brute's got burns on
him. Have to do something about those, or he'll be gone in fifteen
minutes! I wonder if she knows how to fix them! Consuelo's sure
to&mdash;old hens like her know everything! Well&mdash;it's the
only chance the devil's got&mdash;here goes!"</p>

<p>He lifted Wahl again and hoisted him into his own car as
carefully as he could.</p>

<p>"I hope you die before we get there!" he panted, climbing in
beside him. "I hope you jolt to death!"</p>

<p>He drove awfully carefully, getting out once or twice to make
sure of the best places in the road, for the fog was denser than
ever; and it was about ten minutes before he saw the lights in the
cabin window and turned in cautiously through the gap in the rough
stone wall. Leaving Wahl in the car, he ran up the cabin steps and
opened without knocking.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32">CHAPTER 32.</a><br>
"D'you suppose we're very wicked people?"</h2>

<p class="first">"There is a destiny doth shape our ends," and
destiny itself doubtless governed by intelligence whose vision
comprehends the finished scheme. But the business of being shaped
is often no more comfortable than a toad's under the harrow. One
may imagine that the toad resents the teeth and lacks enthusiasm
for high farming.</p>

<p>And so Jacqueline. She had time, while John Miro's sumptuous
limousine devoured leagues of fog-wrapped road toward the
mountains, to learn all over again what helplessness and dimness
are, the fog and Consuelo seconding young human nature.</p>

<p>The fog made Consuelo nervous, and she tried to drive from the
back seat, as she used to when Zeke was piloting Don Andres' car
below the levees. Jacqueline endured that for an hour, and then her
own nerves began to give way under the strain.</p>

<p>"Be still, Consuelo! If we're lucky, he may drive us over a
precipice! I hope he will!"</p>

<p>That remark set Consuelo in earnest to the task of mustering
herself &mdash;a stern fight, needing time. She sat with pursed
lips, breathing through her nose, for fifteen minutes able to do no
more than to refrain from screaming at the turns, or when
headlights appeared suddenly in the fog. But no more that night did
she add to Jacqueline's burden, and it was not long before she
became a very tower of strength.</p>

<p>The fog was a symbol of Jacqueline's thoughts. So was the
limousine. She felt that she was being swept along, even as she had
been when the flood broke through the levees, by a power there was
no resisting, through obscurity, toward terrors none could foresee.
Was she not in a car that belonged to Desmio's enemy? John Miro'
sky-sign blazed in her memory beside the Tribune's golden boast of
"ALL THE NEWS THE PUBLIC WANTS." She was news
&mdash;news&mdash;news again&mdash;news in her night-dress with a
lover coming through the bedroom window. Only this time the lover
was Sherry, and her heart ached for him; and that made it
worse.</p>

<p>What could she do? There was nothing&mdash;nothing to do but to
sit there and be bowled along&mdash;toward what? She had no notion
even of where John Miro's car was taking her, except that it was to
be somewhere in the mountains. And what then? What after that, but
more trouble, and more disgrace, and more awful drawings in the
Sunday papers, with people reading them in curl-papers and slippers
at the breakfast table?</p>

<p>And if Sherry should "stick to her through thick and thin," as
he had promised, and as she did not doubt he intended, there would
be the ghastly knowledge that she had dragged down the man she
truly loved to the hell into which destiny had plunged her.</p>

<p>It was worse, not better, now that Sherry had discovered her.
What craziness had induced her to come to San Francisco of all
places? Weren't there other places where she and Consuelo could
have scrubbed floors? Scrubbing only made your back and arms ache,
whereas' this&mdash;But even scrubbing had its mental terror. She
recalled the Chinaman. Were there always people after you, whatever
you did? People like Wahl and the Chinaman, hungry to sell you in
the market-place as news or something worse. She did not know even
now just what the Chinaman had meant, and did not want to know; but
it was something hideously dreadful, that her whole being shrank
from.</p>

<p>"Consuelo, d'you suppose we're very wicked people, you and I?"
she asked suddenly. "Why else should this happen?"</p>

<p>"Honey dear, there'll be an end to it."</p>

<p>"I know there will. I can't stand it much longer."</p>

<p>Consuelo racked her mind for solace, but found none to offer.
She felt she was no longer in Jacqueline's confidence. Ever since
their meeting after the flood she had known there was a secret
being kept from her. Dad Lawrence's arrival on the scene, and his
unexpected, unexplained friendliness had only added to the mystery.
And who was the young man who had cannoned into her in the bedroom
doorway at the El Toro&mdash;whom Lawrence had told to make haste
by the fire-escape&mdash;and who had waited outside in the
street?</p>

<p>Having nothing to say, she said nothing, mastering her own
emotions, and waiting watchfully in the hope that Jacqueline would
presently take her into confidence.</p>

<p>But she was no nearer to the truth when they reached the
Mansfield cabin and the chauffeur set a light to the wood already
piled in the great stone fireplace. Jacqueline hardly thanked the
man; he belonged to John Miro, who was Desmio's enemy, and so hers.
But his going made Consuelo feel friendless and afraid, and to keep
herself from hysteria she set to work to explore the cabin at once
with a housekeeper's eye for details. She knew within ten minutes
where to lay her hands on everything the place contained.</p>

<p>But Jacqueline knew all that she wanted to know&mdash;and
more&mdash; within thirty seconds after the fire leaped on the
hearth. It was an extravagantly luxurious cabin, and on one wall
was an oil-painting of Mansfield senior, with a gilt shield
attached to the frame, and thereon the legend that the portrait was
a token of esteem from the staff of the San Francisco Tribune.</p>

<p>So she was in Mansfield's house&mdash;his guest!</p>

<p>Well&mdash;she would not trouble him long; she would be gone by
morning. She would go now, only she felt so tired. And at last she
was able to be glad about something; she was in the mountains;
there would be caves, or a forest she could hide in. She was glad
she had seen Mansfield and had called him names. Perhaps she would
leave a note for him on the table before she went away forever,
telling him things she had forgotten to say to his face.</p>

<p>She did not think of him as Sherry's father just then, but as a
dragon that she had faced in its lair, and that had turned out to
be only a coward and a bully after all. She despised him. She felt
no longer in the least afraid of him.</p>

<p>But tired&mdash;no, not tired&mdash;crushed, and almost dead,
with no desire to go on living. The world was an awful place, with
nothing in it but cruelty. Even her own love for Sherry was a cruel
thing, because it would inevitably ruin him, and she wished she had
disguised her real feelings when he made love to her in the barn,
so that she might have saved him from what must follow.</p>

<p>She wished she might love him without his loving her, because
then only she would suffer. But what was the use of wishing? She
lay down on the couch before the fire and tried to go to sleep and
forget everything.</p>

<p>But Consuelo had found things to eat, and came and warmed them
at the fire, and it was useless to try to forget with Consuelo at
your elbow urging you to take stuff from a spoon&mdash;"so that
you'll feel strong again, honey." She did not want to feel strong,
and was not strong enough to resist. But even so, she did not eat
the stuff, for she spilt it when the door burst open and she saw
Sherry framed against the night.</p>

<p>She did not feel glad to see him, although her heart leaped. She
felt too weak and tired to endure a scene with him, and to send him
away forever as she knew she must do. But life seemed to be just
one cruelty after another; and she supposed she must stand up and
face it. However, Sherry only flashed one glance at her, as if to
make sure she was there, and then made one of his abrupt remarks,
to Consuelo, not to her:</p>

<p>"Come out here and lend a hand, please."</p>

<p>No explanation&mdash;hardly a pause before he had disappeared
again, leaving the door wide open and the mist pouring in. Consuelo
ran to slam the door with an exclamation of disgust&mdash;caught
sight of something&mdash; exclaimed "Heavens and earth, what
next!"&mdash;and disappeared too. Jacqueline was too tired even to
feel curious, but got off the couch; and about two minutes after
that Sherry and Consuelo came staggering up the steps carrying a
man between them. They laid the man on the couch and Jacqueline
looked at him. It was Wahl.</p>

<p>"Found him under a burning auto. He'll die if he's not seen to,"
announced Sherry, and then turned to Jacqueline, as if all that
were Consuelo's business. He tried to take Jacqueline's hand, but
she snatched it away, seizing on Wahl as the excuse.
Anything&mdash;anything to postpone argument.</p>

<p>"Burns! Burns!" cried Consuelo, running for the bathroom, where
she knew there were medicines in a cupboard. She came back with
arnica, and then found a bedsheet and tore it into strips.
"Scissors!" she demanded. "I can't find any."</p>

<p>Sherry produced his pocket-knife, and Consuelo began to rip
Wahl's clothes off, jerking out orders to Sherry, and muttering to
herself as she saw how serious the burns and bruises were. For
fifteen or twenty minutes she kept Sherry occupied, and there was
nothing for Jacqueline to do but make the strips of the torn sheet
into rolls, and to look on. She was looking at Wahl's face when he
opened his eyes at last, stared straight at her, and closed them
again. She thought he had recognized her, but she did not care.</p>

<p>She was surprised to discover how little she feared Wahl, now
that he was under the same roof with her. It never once entered her
head that, without Consuelo caring for him, he would not recover
from his injuries. He was still Wahl&mdash;the devil's own. But
somehow he had lost all terror for her. She was much more afraid of
Sherry, because Sherry, she knew, would claim her presently and she
would have to steel her heart against him. It was going to be the
most difficult thing she had ever done. She kept on looking at Wahl
because that made it easier to avoid meeting Sherry's eyes.</p>

<p>Wahl recovered consciousness again and stared straight at her
about a minute. She met his gaze steadily, not feeling even a
desire to flinch. His eyes were cavernous, and horrible with pain.
She found that she even pitied him. When he sat up suddenly and
pointed at her with a bandaged arm, she stood her
ground&mdash;although her frown was dancing over startled eyes. She
tried to force herself to smile, so as to make him feel at ease as
much as possible. Surely his burns and bruises were discomfort
enough.</p>

<p>"Think you've scored, don't you!" he said, misinterpreting the
smile and the frown. He grinned back hatefully, and glanced at
Sherry. "Hello, young Mansfield! You are a bright one! Tribune's
only son and heir, eh? God! You'd have a paper on the rocks in a
week! How did I get here? You bring me! Well, there's that in your
favor. Bring me that phone, quick! Bring it here&mdash; the cord's
long enough. Call the Tribune, and hold the instrument so I can
speak into it."</p>

<p>Sherry did not answer, but laid both hands on Wahl's shoulders
and pressed him down until his head was on the pillow.</p>

<p>"Treason!" Wahl yelled at him. "Treason! I've identified her!
Bring me that phone, young Mansfield, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Sherry ordered.</p>

<p>"Me? You can't do it, youngster!" Wahl laughed like a ghoul and
struggled to sit up again. Sherry held him down. "You can't stop
Clinton Wahl&mdash; can't shut him up! Can't kill him! Get that?
You can't kill him! I'm Wahl, youngster! Special&mdash;that's me!
Bring me that phone! I'll spill 'em a hot one over the wire!
Jacqueline Lanier and Sherry Mansfield&mdash;" He began to say
awful things about them both, sliding off into delirium and raving
of indecencies the Chinaman had only hinted at. Consuelo shook
Sherry by the arm.</p>

<p>"Take her outside while I quiet him!"</p>

<p>She did not know who Sherry was, nor how she should quiet Wahl,
but anything was better than that Jacqueline should hear that
raving. Sherry acted almost before the words were
spoken&mdash;threw Jacqueline's cape over her shoulders and led her
outside, shutting the door behind them. But he could still hear
Wahl's voice through the door, so he coaxed her down the steps to
the wide gap in the wall that answered for a gate. She shuddered,
and he put an arm around her, folding her cape closer with his
other hand.</p>

<p>The cabin was above the fog now. The blanket had drifted lower
and lay shrouding the valley, creating a weird effect of isolation.
Not even a glow was visible above the distant city. They seemed all
alone with the moon and stars, above the clouds.</p>

<p>Jacqueline did not speak, and Sherry studied her anxiously. The
moonlight seemed to emphasize her beauty, but there was a new
paleness in it that worried him; it was almost as if something
within her had burned out; as if she had gone as far emotionally as
she could go, and was waiting for the inevitable end.</p>

<p>"I was on my way to stop Wahl from reaching you when I found him
by the roadside under his car," he began.</p>

<p>She turned a little toward him, but showed no emotion. Her eyes
were listless, and the color of utterly still pools.</p>

<p>"I was afraid it was you who had hurt him," she said. "I'm so
glad you didn't. It doesn't matter about Wahl. He would have found
me sooner or later. If not he, some one else like him, and they've
already done their worst to me. That is what I was foolish not to
know."</p>

<p>The note of despair was in her voice that always struck such
terror into Consuelo, and Sherry felt panic race through him.</p>

<p>"Look here, Jacqueline!" he said, trying to speak sternly.
"You're not to talk that way! You get me? You're not to think those
kind of thoughts! You've done too much of it already. I'm with you
now, and nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>She held up her hand to stop him. "Please, Sherry! You only make
it harder for me. You only make it hurt all the more. Please go.
Consuelo and I are going away&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught hold of her and turned her toward him, unconscious of
his roughness.</p>

<p>"I'm not going, and you're not going away. Or if you do go, I'll
go with you!" he answered. "Your fight is my fight. Get me? They
can't do or say a thing to you without doing or saying it to me.
You're mine, and I'm yours. They can't undo that, and neither can
we."</p>

<p>It was a pathetic little laugh that answered him, but it held
vestiges of life.</p>

<p>"It makes me happy, Sherry, to hear you say that. But
Jacqueline&mdash; your Jacqueline, that is&mdash;is dead and can't
ever come back to life, because nobody believes her. I learned that
tonight."</p>

<p>"Good lord! But I believe you!" he retorted.</p>

<p>"Do you, Sherry? I'm so grateful. But you must go away, because
I bring only unhappiness to every one who loves me, and I don't
want to make you unhappy. Desmio&mdash;Jack
Calhoun&mdash;Consuelo&mdash;now you. It's too much, Sherry! And
Wahl&mdash;Wahl nearly dies trying to reach me. I bring misfortune
to every one."</p>

<p>Sherry stared at her, utterly, absolutely sure of his own mind,
but wondering what to say. She recognized the consternation in his
face, knew she hurt him, and was much more sorry for him than for
herself. Tears suddenly blinded her eyes and ran down her face
unheeded.</p>

<p>"Sherry dear, do go! Will you please go? Your father will not
forgive you if you love me. If I hurt you any more than I have done
already I couldn't bear it. I love you. See&mdash;I tell you, dear,
I love you. And if you love me, you will let me go away&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sherry's answer died still-born. There came from close at hand
the roar and stutter of a big car being driven uphill. Headlights
blazed around the bend.</p>

<p>"Who now? That's not my dad's car," Sherry muttered. "Maybe it's
reporters from one of the other papers," he said, throwing his arm
around Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Come on, sweetheart&mdash;back to the cabin! I won't let 'em
in."</p>

<p>He almost carried her up the steps. But the car came roaring in
through the gap, and he had hardly locked the door when a man's
fist struck on it and he heard his father's voice:</p>

<p>"Come on now, Sherry&mdash;open the door!"</p>

<p>He turned the key again, then turned his back and walked to
mid-room, beside Jacqueline, where he swung himself around and
stood to face his father with his jaw set tight and both fists
clenched. Consuelo was sitting on a chair beside Wahl, but rose to
her feet when Mansfield entered, closely followed by Dad Lawrence
and John Miro. Miro bowed to Jacqueline, undid his overcoat, and
walked to the corner of the fireplace, where he stood erect, like a
man in armor. Mansfield stood silent, with his back to the door,
glancing from Sherry to Wahl and again from Wahl to Sherry. No one
spoke for thirty seconds.</p>

<p>It was Wahl who broke the silence. "Chief!" he yelled. "I've got
her! Get to the phone&mdash;quick! O.K. that story! Then spill 'em
a follow-up &mdash;have 'em put a live man on the other end! Here
she is! Caught in your cabin with your son! Didn't I tell you she'd
vamp Sherry? Watch her, or she'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sherry put his clenched fist close to Wahl's nose. "Shut up!" he
commanded, "or I'll finish you, you beast!"</p>

<p>Wahl began to swear excitedly at Sherry, but Dad Lawrence picked
up a towel, gagged Wahl with it, and held his head down on the
pillow. Sherry turned again to face his father:</p>

<p>"Long live the Tribune!" he said grimly; and Miro, over by the
fireplace, chuckled.</p>

<p>"Did you do that to Wahl?" demanded Mansfield. "Did he hurt you?
Did he attack you?"</p>

<p>"No. I wish he had. Then I'd have killed him!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he should be killed! He's all but killed her," Sherry
answered, with a jerk of the head toward Jacqueline but meeting his
father's gaze steadily.</p>

<p>"May I ask what possible concern that is of yours?" Mansfield
tried to keep the sneer out of his voice, but failed, and Sherry's
eyes blazed at him.</p>

<p>"Sure!" he answered. "And I'll tell you! She's the girl I love,
that's all. So now you know where I come in."</p>

<p>"Sherry, my boy&mdash;" Mansfield was trying hard to master his
emotion &mdash;"we'll have to talk that over later. When a young
girl has a reputation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" Sherry held his hand up. "None of that, dad! Wahl made
her reputation. Wahl is a liar!"</p>

<p>"But it's public property," said Mansfield.</p>

<p>"Yes, and whose fault's that? But I'm not going to argue with
you. I don't give a damn what all the papers in Christendom have
printed about her, or will print. She's the girl I love. She has my
absolute O.K. I'm going to marry her."</p>

<p>"You're not!" said Mansfield; and once more John Miro chuckled,
striking a match on the chimney-stones to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>It was almost as if the match had set a light to Jacqueline! The
spirit returned to her eyes. Before Sherry could prevent her she
stepped forward toward Mansfield, and the tragedy written on her
face made even him look at her with a changed expression. Dad
Lawrence, with his hand on the towel over Wahl's mouth, was almost
crying. John Miro burned his fingers with the match.</p>

<p>"Sherry is not going to marry me, Mr. Mansfield&mdash;because I
am not going to let him. I have been telling him that, but he will
not listen."</p>

<p>Her voice sounded very tired, and Consuelo made a move toward
her. Mansfield glanced at Sherry.</p>

<p>"That seems final, doesn't it?" he said abruptly.</p>

<p>Sherry stepped in front of Jacqueline and faced his father more
angrily than ever. Jacqueline felt Consuelo's arms behind her and
almost collapsed into them. Dad Lawrence left off holding Wahl and
came to the rescue with a chair on which Jacqueline collapsed
entirely, laying her head back against Consuelo's bosom and closing
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Final?" exploded Sherry. "This is final&mdash;what you're
hearing from me now. You, and the other newspapers, have pretty
nearly killed her. If you don't do every damn thing you can to put
her right again before the world, then I'm through with you, not
her! That's final! I'm on her side forever. Watch me, if you don't
believe it!"</p>

<p>He turned toward Jacqueline&mdash;tried to thrust Consuelo aside
and take her place&mdash;failed, might as well have tried to shove
a battle-ship&mdash;laid a hand on Jacqueline's shoulder&mdash;and
once more faced his father.</p>

<p>Mansfield snorted. "How come that you think you know so much
about her?" he asked, making no effort this time to disguise the
sneer. Sherry glared back at him.</p>

<p>"Good God! Look at her! Dad, are you crazy? Use your eyes! Here
she is! This is the girl you've been flaying alive&mdash;this
one&mdash;here! This is Jacqueline Lanier!"</p>

<p>"Aye, there she is!" Wahl broke in, trying to struggle off the
couch. "Go to it, Chief! Grab the phone, man&mdash;" Dad Lawrence
jumped for the towel again, Wahl's yell died down to smothered
murmurs, and then ceased.</p>

<p>Mansfield conceded Sherry's point to the extent of scowling at
Jacqueline again, his brows meeting over his eyes and his
expression like that of a scientist studying a vicious insect.</p>

<p>"I will listen to her if she has anything she'd care to say," he
volunteered ungraciously. "I've heard her once," he added.</p>

<p>"When?" demanded Sherry, but did not wait for an answer.
"Jacqueline dear," he said, leaning over her, "tell dad what you
told me&mdash;will you? Tell him all that
happened&mdash;please&mdash;for my sake! Dad, for God's sake listen
to her! And look while you listen! Does she look as if she could
lie, even if she would? Jacqueline dear&mdash;tell him&mdash;won't
you!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline looked up at Sherry and sighed, feeling she would
rather die than drag that awful past before a man who listened
almost against his will. She had thought her pride was dead, but it
was not. Pride urged her to refuse. But she would have cut off her
right hand for Sherry, even as she had cut out her heart for him.
Mansfield was staring at her, and that made it worse. She could not
think connectedly. Where should she begin?</p>

<p>"Please, dear, won't you tell him?" Sherry urged. She glanced up
at Sherry again, and began playing with the heavy locket on the
gold chain.</p>

<p>"Desmio&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice broke into a sob and she faltered&mdash;stopped. Not
even for Sherry's sake could she force herself to drag Desmio's
name through the mud to oblige a stranger. She was not crying.
There were no tears. She simply leaned back against Sherry's arm
and could not go on&mdash;had reached the limit of emotion and
endurance.</p>

<p>"Who is Desmio?" demanded Mansfield, and John Miro threw his
cigarette into the fire. He stepped forward, as if to join in the
discussion, but said nothing. Consuelo gave him no time.</p>

<p>Wrath&mdash;boiling, royal, fearless wrath took hold of Consuelo
then, and even Mansfield (terrible himself in wrath) flinched in
front of her.</p>

<p>"Be quiet now, honey-lamb!" she said with one swift turn of
tenderness, for Jacqueline had felt rather than seen the coming
storm and made the beginning of a move to protest. "I'll tell him!"
With one shove not much less violent than a blow Consuelo thrust
Sherry away. Then she stood behind the chair, leaning forward over
it, fixing her eyes on Mansfield's.</p>

<p>"Look!" she commanded. "She was born into my arms. I've been
with her almost every hour since then, except when she was in the
convent. She's as innocent and sweet and good now, as she was that
day I first set eyes on her. You and your newspapers! I've read
your lies! Look! See what your lies have done to her!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline tried to protest again, but Consuelo threw both arms
around her, kissed her, glared around the room and back at
Mansfield.</p>

<p>"You ask who's Desmio," she snorted. "A better man than ever
you'll be! It was her name for Don Andres Miro. He's the gentleman
who raised her in his home&mdash;and was that proud of
her&mdash;and loved and worshiped her so well that, when he knew he
was dying, he asked her to marry him. He knew her! He understood
her! Since she was three years old she'd been better than a
daughter to him. He couldn't make her his heir any other way, so he
took that means to provide a proper mistress for his great estates,
and to make sure she would never lack for anything!"</p>

<p>Wahl stuck his head up over the end of the couch, tried to
struggle to his feet, and shouted:</p>

<p>"How about the handsome lover Jack Calhoun?"</p>

<p>Dad Lawrence used the towel again, although Mansfield made a
gesture of disapproval.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;what of Calhoun?" asked Mansfield.</p>

<p>"That cockerel! That jackanapes!" Consuelo almost screamed her
answer at him. "He was like the rest of you! He hunted her! He saw
a flower and craved to pluck it! He was a beast like you! A
monster! A young spendthrift! I know twenty girls he's ruined! He'd
liked to have married this lamb, and he'd have ruined her life as
you've done, only she'd have nothing to do with him, and I saw to
it that he never once&mdash;not once!&mdash;saw her alone, until
her wedding day, when he sneaked in. My back was turned. I'd seen
him in the garden. I was looking for gentlemen who'd throw him in
the horse-pond. That was how he sneaked into her bedroom. Don
Andres must have seen him go in there. And when Don Andres went to
protect Miss Jacqueline, Calhoun shot him."</p>

<p>Consuelo paused for breath, gulped once or twice, and went
on:</p>

<p>"But he was better than you are. He had shame! He shot himself!
You stand there proud of your dirty work! That beast&mdash;that
Clinton Wahl&mdash;was sneaking like a thief about the house, and
he was into the bedroom ahead of me. There the poor darling
stood&mdash;with the gentleman who should have been her husband in
the next five minutes, shot dead at her feet&mdash;and Calhoun with
his brains on the bed-spread&mdash;and that beast Wahl hanging on
to her wrist, snarling at her, trying to make her talk to him!
Wanted her to tickle his ear with information! I gave him some! He
followed us to my room, where I put the poor darling to bed, and
threatened us through the keyhole, until one of the nigger footmen
knocked him down.</p>

<p>Then he tried to get in through the bedroom window, until a
gardener chased him! Then he wrote those lies; and a paper in New
Orleans printed them &mdash;and she&mdash;what else could she do
but run away? Think of it, you &mdash;you&mdash;devil! Can you
think? Have you any heart in you? Do you know what it means to be
brought up by a gentleman amid refinement&mdash; sheltered, and
looked up to by the folk of half a dozen counties&mdash;and then to
see that filth printed about you in a newspaper that goes into
people's homes? Maybe you wouldn't hide yourself; you haven't the
pride or decency! You don't know what innocence means! She ran
away. And I went with her, to look after her&mdash;for I'd cut off
both hands and put my eyes out any minute, if that 'ud do her one
bit of good. And at that, I don't love her more than all the rest
of 'em who knew her!"</p>

<p>It was Consuelo's hour; the climax of seventeen years devotion.
Never before had she addressed an audience, never before had she
been quite bereft of meekness. She faced that tribunal, and scorned
it as unreservedly as she hoped someday to stand and be judged at
the world's end.</p>

<p>She told all the story of the flight to San Francisco, of
Jacqueline's bravery, of the debt to Ramon and Jacqueline's
insistence on dancing with Ramon, in order to pay the debt; and
then of Wahl's invasion of the stage in the effort to uncover her
identity.</p>

<p>"The beast would like to strip her naked!" she screamed. "And
you'd like to print pictures of it! You dogs! You've crucified her!
And all the while that poor frightened honey-lamb was struggling to
pay her debt and hide from your dirty lies, you were printing more
lies about her, for the mob to read and gloat over, and to pay you
nickels!"</p>

<p>Sherry made a bad break then. He approached Consuelo and laid a
hand on her shoulder, meaning well enough; he intended to show her
there was at least one friend near at hand. But he might as well
have tried to stroke a bull in the arena.</p>

<p>"You're one of them!" she screamed at him. "You're his son,
aren't you? You're the brat of that thing, that owns the Tribune!
You&mdash;you reckon yourself fit to kiss the ground she's walked
on? Don't touch me, you young reptile! Hands off of her!"</p>

<p>Sherry made a move toward Jacqueline, and that was Consuelo's
last straw. She threw her arms around Jacqueline&mdash;hugged
her&mdash;"Oh, my poor darling&mdash;my poor darling
honey-lamb!"&mdash;almost lifted her off the chair, set her down in
another one by the fireplace opposite John Miro's corner, seized
the kettle that she had set on the hearth to boil when she first
entered the cabin, and stood at bay. The kettle was full. The
scalding water spluttered from spout and lid as she shook it.</p>

<p>"Now out of here&mdash;the lot of you! Outside&mdash;and take
that devil with you!"</p>

<p>She shook the kettle at Wahl, and narrowly missed scalding him.
Dad Lawrence sprang aside, letting go of Wahl, and Wahl sat up
again.</p>

<p>"Chief!" he yelled, "It's a beat! It's a whale of a beat! Get to
the phone, man! Spill it to 'em!&mdash;'Lanier girl takes to the
woods&mdash; slips through prohibition net and stands at bay with
scalding water!'&mdash; Go to it, Chief! It's a pippin!"</p>

<p>Mansfield scowled. Dad Lawrence jumped for Wahl and forced his
head down on the pillow. Mansfield glanced at Miro, who was smiling
and very deliberately lighting another cigarette. He held up his
hand.</p>

<p>"Put that kettle down," he ordered.</p>

<p>Consuelo glared defiance at him. She feared no man in that
minute. She made a move as if to use the kettle and drive them all
out of the room. But a tired, despairing voice, that touched her
old heart even through the armor of that wrath, spoke from behind
her:</p>

<p>"Consuelo dear, please put the kettle down."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33">CHAPTER 33.</a><br>
"And you shall sit in the patio<br>
all day long and boss the niggers."</h2>

<p class="first">Mansfield walked over to Wahl and looked down at
him.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what that nurse said just now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You bet I did," Wahl answered, sitting upright. "She's a liar,
that's all." Mansfield's voice and air of authority seemed to bring
him to his senses. His eyes looked suddenly less wild. "Don't
forget, I was there, Chief. I saw it! I got it all first hand."</p>

<p>"Did you check your facts?" asked Mansfield.</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>Consuelo drew her breath in with a gasp&mdash;ready on the
instant to renew the fight. Mansfield stopped her, holding up his
hand.</p>

<p>"How did you check them?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Interviewed the sister of Don Andres!" Wahl answered. "Saw her
in private in her own room&mdash;got it straight from her. She told
me all about the girl's character. Donna Isabella wasn't guessing,
mind you&mdash;she'd lived in the same house with her for
years!"</p>

<p>Mansfield coughed dryly. Consuelo gave another gulp and started
forward, words choking in her throat. Mansfield glanced at Sherry
with a wry smile, and Sherry answered that by going over to
Jacqueline and taking her limp hand in his. It was John Miro who
entered the lists, as calmly as he did all other things. He tossed
his cigarette into the fire and walked straight up to
Mansfield.</p>

<p>"The point is, are you man enough to confess mistakes?" he said,
smiling. "As her cousin, and at one time the friend of her family,
you'll probably admit that I knew as much of Donna Isabella's
character as she ever knew of Jacqueline's. Donna Isabella was as
mad as your man Clinton Wahl. Are you mad too? I rather think not.
Suppose you take another look at Miss Lanier. Judge for yourself,
whether to believe her, and the nurse, and your own son, and me
&mdash;or Wahl and Donna Isabella."</p>

<p>"Chief!" Wahl shouted. "Get to the phone! Don't you trust your
own men?"</p>

<p>"Does it occur to you to trust me?" Dad suggested. Mansfield
glanced at Jacqueline&mdash;and at Consuelo&mdash;and at Sherry. He
was scowling; his brows nearly met over his eyes.</p>

<p>"Get to the phone, man! O.K. that story of mine!" Wahl yelled at
him.</p>

<p>Mansfield looked at Wahl again steadily, for thirty seconds.
Then he turned to the phone and took off the receiver.</p>

<p>"That's right, Chief!" Wahl shouted. "Run your own newspaper,
and to hell with&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dad Lawrence used the towel again. There was silence&mdash;the
tenseness of impending tragedy.</p>

<p>"Long distance&mdash;quick!" said Mansfield. "Operator&mdash;see
how quickly you can get the San Francisco Tribune. There are
several wires. Put me in on any of 'em. This is rush stuff. Step on
her!"</p>

<p>Miro joined Sherry beside Jacqueline. Dad Lawrence shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Hello&mdash;Tribune? Who's speaking? Give me the
desk&mdash;quick! Hello&mdash;this is Mansfield. That you, Blair?
D'you recognize my voice? All right&mdash;kill that Lanier story!
What's that? I don't get you. Won't be any first edition? I don't
care&mdash;I said kill the story&mdash;did you hear me?"</p>

<p>The instrument buzzed into Mansfield's ear for thirty
seconds.</p>

<p>"Dad, you're white! I knew you were!" said Sherry, and leaned
over and kissed Jacqueline. Consuelo watched him, fuming. Mansfield
held up his hand for silence.</p>

<p>"What's that? You don't believe it's Mansfield speaking? Just
try disobeying me, and see how soon I'll prove it to you! Cancel
the whole edition! If the vans have started, call 'em
back&mdash;send people after 'em. I'll fire the whole outfit if one
of those papers goes on sale!"</p>

<p>"All right, Chief!" The words could be heard distinctly all
through the room, and Mansfield hung up. He glanced at Wahl.</p>

<p>"Put him in one of the bedrooms," he commanded. Dad&mdash;stay
in there with him, and keep him quiet."</p>

<p>Sherry and Dad Lawrence carried Wahl out. Miro came forward and
met Mansfield in mid-room.</p>

<p>"You eat crow rather handsomely," he said. "I like you for it.
Blame it on the system and the public, though, not on that poor
burned devil in the bedroom there."</p>

<p>Mansfield almost ignored him. He was thinking of something else.
He walked toward Jacqueline, and Consuelo stepped into his way. He
smiled at Consuelo, and though she bridled up and caught her
breath, she stood aside again, watching him suspiciously. Then:</p>

<p>"Miss Jacqueline Lanier!" Jacqueline looked up, very
woebegone.</p>

<p>"I wish to beg your pardon as humbly as a man may. I have never
before in all my life retracted or apologized. Your presence is an
honor to my cabin and I sincerely regret the cruelty and deep
indignity to you for which the Tribune is in part responsible."</p>

<p>Consuelo burst out sobbing, but Jacqueline managed to smile,
leaning forward and seizing Consuelo's red hand, stroking it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansfield&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he had not finished yet. He interrupted.</p>

<p>"I can promise you a full revenge, Miss Jacqueline! Whatever can
be done to restore your fair name and reputation before the world
shall be done by the Tribune immediately. I will sign the
retraction and the other newspapers will copy it. They will make me
look&mdash;and feel&mdash;extremely foolish."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansfield, I don't want revenge," said Jacqueline. "I'll
hide, to save Sherry from&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can do that, if he'll let you," Mansfield interrupted. "But
if he does let you I'll never speak to him again."</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed at last, and Sherry took her into his arms,
but he hardly had time to kiss her once before Consuelo interfered.
Mansfield turned his back, John Miro used better
judgment&mdash;recognized the symptoms &mdash;knew that Consuelo's
wrath had left her half-hysterical. She would be trying to scratch
Sherry's eyes out in a minute. He stepped between them, and stood
smiling down at Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"There's a point we've not explained yet," he said kindly. "You
surely knew I live in San Francisco, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>She nodded, just a little proudly.</p>

<p>"D'you mind saying why you didn't appeal to me at once for
help?"</p>

<p>"How could I, Mr. Miro? You and Desmio. I could not appeal to
Desmio's enemy."</p>

<p>John Miro laughed. "His enemy?" he answered. "Jacqueline, I
loved the man! He and I were boys together. I knew him too well and
intimately not to love him. The dear, old dignified Don Quixote!
The only thing we ever quarreled over was my advertising, and at
that it was he who quarreled with me, not I with him. I would have
crossed the continent at any time for the sheer delight of shaking
hands with him."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Miro, I thought&mdash;you must have thought&mdash;that
&mdash;that Desmio and I conspired to do you out of the estates. If
he had married me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear girl, I never wanted your potato patch! I wouldn't know
what to do with it. It's yours by every moral right."</p>

<p>"But the trust deed, Mr. Miro&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All that ever needed was my signature," he answered. "Andres
could have had it for the asking. The first thing I did after
attending Andres' funeral was to interview his lawyer Curtis
Radcliffe. You'll find your estates are in Radcliffe's keeping. As
I told Radcliffe, and repeat to you, whatever Andres wished to do
with his estates is law as far as I'm concerned. We'll terminate
the Miro trust deed just as soon as Radcliffe submits the papers
for my signature."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but there's Donna Isabella."</p>

<p>"No. She's dead. I rather think I personally killed her. No,
don't look shocked&mdash;perhaps I claim more credit than is due
me. I told her she was a snob, and it seems that nobody ever
thought of telling her the truth before. She took to her bed that
afternoon, and died yesterday."</p>

<p>Jacqueline felt genuinely sorry. She would much rather have
endured Donna Isabella's vinegary enmity for the rest of her life
than hear of her dying all alone. She knew that Donna Isabella had
no friends. Even Consuelo drooped at the news. But Mansfield senior
made no pretense to any kind of grief; he strode back across the
room and faced John Miro.</p>

<p>"So you're doing that for her?" he said pleasantly. "She'll not
be penniless, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not by a million or so," said Miro. "Maybe several million. I
don't know the figures."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Sherry will have the Tribune. That means at least as
much for him."</p>

<p>"Don't forget," Miro answered, smiling, "that will be my doing
too! I would have smashed the Tribune, and you with it,
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;shake hands and shut up prodding me" said Mansfield.
"And give me one of your cigars; you drove that infernal car of
yours so fast over the bumps that I broke all mine. Are you sleepy?
It's nearly morning. Let's go out and hear the birds wake."</p>

<p>They walked out together, smoking. Consuelo, swallowing
something in her throat, went into the room where Dad Lawrence was
watching Wahl.</p>

<p>"Good woman, that," said Mansfield. "I was half-afraid, though,
she'd stay in there and fight with Sherry. These two kids are best
left alone now, to settle it between themselves."</p>

<p>"They won't have very long," said Miro. "I'm expecting some
one."</p>

<p>"You are?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I used the telephone before I called on you at the Tribune
office."</p>

<p>Mansfield turned on him sharply. "Not reporters from the other
papers!"</p>

<p>"Wait and see. That's a car coming now."</p>

<p>It was a closed car that came much more slowly than Miro's had
done, but which none the less seemed in a hurry. A face framed in
white in the window looked almost ghostly in the dim light from the
cabin windows&mdash;the face of some one who leaned forward,
strained and anxious. Miro strode up to the car as it swung in
through the gate and stopped. A woman stepped out as he opened the
door for her, and another followed.</p>

<p>"You have found her?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>Miro nodded</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;?"</p>

<p>It was Mansfield, striding out of the shadow behind Miro, who
interrupted.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;Joan?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She looked startled, but recovered instantly. "I came to see
Jacqueline," she said firmly.</p>

<p>"Some mistake," said Miro. "This is&mdash;pardon me&mdash;Mr.
Mansfield&mdash;Sister Michaela."</p>

<p>"Thanks," answered Mansfield, "I know my wife's sister. She was
Joan Sherwood before she took vows. Joan&mdash;how's Sherry's
mother? Do you ever hear from Clara?"</p>

<p>Her gray eyes looked straight back at him, and there was a pause
before she answered:</p>

<p>"I came to save Jacqueline from Clara's fate!"</p>

<p>Mansfield scowled. "Isn't that man she ran away with kind to
her?"</p>

<p>"He was, John."</p>

<p>"Was?" He looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Was. He bore the blame you turned on him. They were neither of
them guilty."</p>

<p>"Why didn't she come back to me then?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"How could she! You were too cruel. You divorced her. You spared
her nothing. You and the newspapers were merciless. She was
hounded. The notoriety was more than she could bear. She went
away."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Where you will not find her."</p>

<p>"My God! You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean, she saved Sherry all she could. She changed her
name&mdash;tried to hide&mdash;struggled, and then&mdash;I have a
message from her for Sherry."</p>

<p>"He's in the cabin. Give it to him," said Mansfield, and stood
staring down the road.</p>

<p>She turned to Miro and he led the way up the cabin steps,
holding the door open for her. She paused on the threshold. Dad
Lawrence was standing in the door of the room where they had laid
Wahl, and from behind him came the weak voice of a man in delirium,
raving:</p>

<p>"Takes to the woods&mdash;that's a hot one! Caught with Sherry
Mansfield &mdash;uses scalding water! Get that Chief? Go to it,
man! Get to the phone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sherry and Dad&mdash;and Dad was not dry-eyed&mdash;were
watching Jacqueline. Her hand was on Consuelo's shoulder. Consuelo
knelt beside her, choking with sobs, her head on her beloved's
lap.</p>

<p>"Oh, honey&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You old dear! Consuelo, you dear, faithful friend! I've brought
all this on you, and you've had much the worst of it. But I love
you, Consuelo. And we're going back, dear, to Louisiana&mdash;and
you shall always be with us &mdash;and you shall sit in the patio
all day long&mdash;and boss the niggers,&mdash;and&mdash;and be
just as good and kind to Sherry as you've always been to me. Will
you do that? Will you promise?"</p>

<p>"Honey, dear&mdash;"</p>
