<h1>The Power And The Glory</h1>

<h2>by Gilbert Parker</h2>

<p>To My Beloved Niece<br>
Lucille Aspegren</p>

<p>While this book is going through the press there comes the cable
announcement from Rome of the beatification of Isaac Jogues, John
de Br&eacute;beuf, Gabriel Lalemant and five other Jesuit oruests
who were martyred in Canada in the days of Louis XIV of France.
Pope Pius, carried in the <i>Sedia Gestatoria</i>, &ldquo;descended
into St. Peter's, which was crowded by sixty thousand people, and
knelt and venerated the new beatified priests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How strange it is that only hundreds of years after the
wonderful sacrifice of their lives, gladly, fearlessly, the formal
recognition should come today when the religious faith of the world
has been deepened by the late war and the souls of men freshly
stimulated. I am not a Roman Catholic, but, a wide traveler, I have
seen missions throughout the world, and today, as in the days of
Br&eacute;beuf and Jogues, they have missionaries who give all for
Christianity.</p>

<p>No greater heroism, no greater devotion to an ideal, ever
inspired any men than that which led the Jesuit missionaries and
explorers to the remote corners of North America. Though a layman,
La Salle was of this noble company, and if the intense political
hatreds of the time forced him into an opposing camp, it did
nothing to dim the luster of his great spirit of the power and the
glory of his achievement, which he shares with Jogues,
Br&eacute;beuf and the others. Canada and the United States are the
heirs of their splendor.</p>

<p>August 1925.<br>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter I</h3>

<h3>At the Ch&acirc;teau Saint Louis</h3>

<p><strong>High</strong> above the St. Lawrence stood Louis, Count
Frontenac alone, soon after his arrival at Quebec as Governor. From
a window of the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis he was looking across the
vast stream which is more renowned than any other in that
hemisphere. As his eyes scanned the immense flood and saw the
exquisite coloring of the foliage on the farther shore in the
bright sunlight, his cheek flushed with admiration. He was now
fifty-two, but in years only. His mind was twenty-five, his body
framed to endure hardships and trials, and these were before him in
immense degree.</p>

<p>As looking out he dreamed big dreams&mdash;he had a fiery,
eloquent soul full of imagination and temperament&mdash;and
compared his humble court with that of Louis XIV, where he had so
much been, grim humor came to his eye. He could not feel he had
mistaken his course. He was poorly paid, but the destiny of this
unknown land had entered into his bones, and it remained there till
the end of his powerful career in Canada, where he yielded up his
breath to the suspirations of millions yet to come of another race,
but bound to him as the skin is to the flesh.</p>

<p>There were not so very many homes in tower Town far below the
cliffs where was the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, but people were
moving about briskly, and there came to Frontenac's ears the
refrain of a song:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;In Heaven there is a
dance,<br></span> <span class="line4">Alleluia!<br></span>
<span class="line0">All the young Virgins danced,<br></span>
<span class="line0">Benedicamus Domino,<br></span> <span class=
"line4">Alleluia! Alleluia!</span></p>

<p><span class="line0">It is for you and me,<br></span>
<span class="line4">Alleluia!<br></span> <span class="line0">We
dance like the young Virgins,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">Benedicamus Domino<br></span> <span class="line4">Alleluia!
Alleluia!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>These were only two of many verses, but the eyes of the Governor
lighted, for they were the spirit of the place; at the same time
there was the ringing of bells in the towers of the cathedral, and
around the Bishop's palace came people eager for the blessing of
Laval, the Bishop of Quebec, poor, unhandsome, but a power
always.</p>

<p>From Lower Town there came the words of another song, that of
the F&ecirc;te of St. Anne:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Now is the F&ecirc;te of St.
Anne,<br></span> <span class="line2">Eh! courage,
hurrah!<br></span> <span class="line0">Already at the bell one
struts about,<br></span> <span class="line2">Eh! courage, hurrah!
sa, sa!<br></span> <span class="line0">Eh! courage,
hurrah!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>The air was so clear that the Governor could hear the words
floating up the cliffside to the Ch&acirc;teau from which could be
seen Upper and Lower Town; and through it all there came the steady
tramp, tramp of feet of soldiers near the citadel. Frontenac closed
his eyes and he heard the footfalls of soldiers in his beloved
France and other lands where he had led them.</p>

<p>His lips moved, speaking to himself, then he opened his eyes
again. He now saw a canoe approach the shore hundreds of feet
below, and a figure issue from it and begin to climb the hill
leading to his Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis. Somehow this figure fitted
in with his late dreaming. It belonged to one who knew the life of
Canada,&mdash;bold, strong, in tattered clothes, as though he had
come a long distance, with rugged, dauntless air, and yet with a
curious union of triumph and tragedy. Presently he lost sight of
the man, and turned to his desk.</p>

<p>As he did so, the door opened and his orderly announced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Le Sieur de la Salle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was not the man Frontenac had seen leaving the canoe, but a
tall, alert, handsome, rather grim-faced man whose eyes looked
clearly at those of Frontenac and at whose lips was a faint smile.
He was clearly a man of splendid physique, and of iron will.
Frontenac had immediately taken to him, for he saw in him,
R&eacute;n&eacute; Robert Cavelier, better known as La Salle, the
true pioneer, who would put all away from him but the land he
loved, and would live for that alone. Also he knew him opposed by
the Jesuits who once had controlled in Canada by influencing
Governor and Intendant, but had seen their power gradually
decline.</p>

<p>Frontenac advanced to La Salle with outstretched hands, a warm
smile on his distinguished face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come at the right moment, Sieur de la Salle&mdash;I
think of Canada's future! Who more welcome then than
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's face lighted. He had come to urge Frontenac to found
a fort at the head of Lake Ontario where the Iroquois could be held
in check, and trade with the English and Dutch from the Upper Lakes
could be stayed. La Salle had discovered the Ohio and the Illinois,
and was eager to trade and explore, the latter most to him of all.
Hunger for wealth never entered his head, and all his life proved
his freedom from lust of gain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency! I am your faithful and devoted servant,
and I have come to beg&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Salle a beggar, but tell that to the wild men of
China&mdash;you come not to beg, my friend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come to urge your building a fort at Lake Ontario, and
if I may command it, good things may come to our dear France and
Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac laughed. &ldquo;Yes, yes, that was in my mind. We
shall do it, yet we are fought by powerful forces. We think alike,
La Salle.&rdquo; He turned to a table on which lay a map and
portfolio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go ahead to Onondaga, the headquarters of the
Iroquois, and ask their sachems to meet me in council. Then we,
shall build the fort. That is not popular, but we must stand firm
or Laval&mdash;the starved and wonderful Monsieur de Quebec of high
birth and educated by the Jesuits&mdash;will have us under his
thumb.&rdquo; He laughed softly. &ldquo;He is a big man, but there
can only be one authority in Canada&mdash;the King, and not the
Church. There is our fighting ground, La Salle, there and nowhere
else. But we shall win, for God and the King will be with
us&mdash;eh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle bowed. &ldquo;Though much be against us&mdash;the
Bishop and Duchesneau and all, we shall win by the grace of
God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jacques Duchesneau&mdash;an Intendant that makes trouble,
and will make more! The tool of the Jesuits, but not strong enough
to conquer me, La Salle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment came a tapping at the door, and an orderly
entered. &ldquo;M'sieu' Joliet would speak with Your
Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joliet, the explorer&mdash;good!&rdquo; said Frontenac.
&ldquo;Admit him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joliet entered, a man of vigor, firm and good to see, and about
the same age as La Salle. He was tattered and wayworn, but
determined and keen-eyed. He had studied for the Jesuit priesthood
in Canada, where he was born, and had left it to become a
fur-trader.</p>

<p>Frontenac saw he had news of importance. He offered his hand and
said: &ldquo;Well, M. Joliet, you have traveled far&rdquo;&mdash;he
pointed to his ragged clothes&mdash;&ldquo;that have you to
tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joliet bowed. &ldquo;With P&egrave;re Marquette we were sent by
M. Talon, the late Intendant, to explore, and after trials and
dangers on the Illinois, we entered the muddy surge of the
Missouri. Out of this chaos we came at last upon the great quiet
waters of the Mississippi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Mississippi&mdash;the Mississippi!&rdquo; said
Frontenac astonished. &ldquo;So, it flows south, not
west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Gulf of Mexico!&rdquo; said Joliet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a great deed,&rdquo; interposed La Salle. &ldquo;By
that, trade will not be stopped for months by ice in the river
there. All the year round to France!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the records of the journey?&rdquo; said
Frontenac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naught, naught! We had escaped every peril from the
Indians. I had passed forty-two rapids, and was landing at La Chine
when my canoe was wrecked. I lost two men and my box of papers
within sight of the settlements I had left years before. Nothing
remains but my life&mdash;to use it as Your Excellency may direct,
if you will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac's face was a study in pride, regret and sympathy.
&ldquo;What matter your records, man! The Mississippi! France will
thank you, as it does now through its Governor. You shall have
service with me, Joliet, and henceforth, so far as I can, all shall
go well with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joliet bowed low with gratitude. Then he said: &ldquo;I will
serve you proudly, monseigneur.&rdquo; He turned to leave, his eyes
alight with pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a moment, Joliet. Here is to relieve your instant
wants,&rdquo; and Frontenac placed a few gold pieces in his
hand.</p>

<p>Joliet shook his head. &ldquo;But no, Your Excellency. You need
them more, for you must spend whether you will or no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac smiled and took back the gold. &ldquo;I have not seen
such great faith, no, not in Israel!&rdquo; he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>When Joliet had gone La Salle said: &ldquo;The finding of the
Mississippi is the summit of all. It opens up a marvelous field of
trade for Louis, the Sun King!&rdquo; His head lifted, his face
shone, vision filled his eyes. &ldquo;I see great things for
France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac, hand at his chin, looked meditatively at La Salle for
a moment, and then said: &ldquo;You live for your country and
naught else, La Salle. You have the unselfish soul.&rdquo; He
dropped a hand on La Salle's shoulder. &ldquo;We can make New
France the wider power of Old France&mdash;you and I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled. The proud, irascible Frontenac felt himself in accord
with this well-born son of Rouen, who was to bring to France and
the new world high honor. La Salle, shy, and with few popular
gifts, still with the power to win all who were not selfishly
against him, said slowly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You honor me, Excellency. We have far to go. I shall find
the mouth of the Mississippi and make from here to the Caribbean
Sea subject to the King of France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac laughed quietly. &ldquo;You see far, La Salle! You
have been at work here seven years and you have paid the utmost
price for all you have got and done. For your first trip of
exploration you sold your seigneury of La Chine and spent the money
in exploration. You are a dreamer, but that you have vast practical
qualities, your deeds show. All you have you give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun shone brilliantly in the room where were few signs of
distinction save the fleur-de-lis, a portrait of Louis XIV, of
Cartier, and of Champlain, and a map roughly drawn of New France,
old oak chairs, wooden walls, dark with time, and a statue head of
Brebeuf, the famous Jesuit missionary who had given his life under
dreadful torture without a sign of pain. Frontenac's eyes were on
this statue now. The Jesuits were against him, but his soul was too
big to let his own wrongs affect his historical sense, and he had
profound admiration for their courage and devotion, though he would
fight to the last their national ambitions. The State first and
last was his theory. Frontenac had vision and the sense of
progress, and he was at one with La Salle.</p>

<p>La Salle said: &ldquo;Excellency, I would receive direct from
His Majesty my right to work in the Far West where foes retard all
I do. The Church is against you as the head of all, and it is
against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac interrupted: &ldquo;I may be the head, but you are not
the tail. You belong to our full body of progress. No, no, La
Salle, you shall not fail. You must go to France. I will give you a
letter to Colbert, the great minister of Louis.&rdquo; His eyes
brightened, his lips laughed gently. &ldquo;You will come back
bigger than you went, and always, I hope, a friend of
Frontenac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle inclined his head gratefully. &ldquo;But not till you
have opened the new Fort. We must have a large background of
western trade before I go to France. It will have weight at
Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac nodded.</p>

<p>At that moment came a tapping at the door, and an orderly
announced the Intendant Duchesneau, the foe of Frontenac, and of La
Salle whom he hated for his trade ambitions and because of his
friendship with the Governor. A look of distrust crossed
Frontenac's face, but he greeted the Intendant courteously.
Duchesneau's eyes lowered sullenly when he saw La Salle, but he
bowed to him with exaggerated impressiveness, while La Salle looked
him steadily in the eyes and responded with grave precision. The
Governor seeing, moved forward and shook La Salle warmly by the
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon voyage, cher Sieur de la Salle</i>,&rdquo; he
said, in courteous and suggestive dismissal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank Your Excellency,&rdquo; responded La Salle and
left the room, knowing why the Governor had spoken as he did.</p>

<p>The Intendant's eyes showed he did not understand Frontenac's
&ldquo;<i>Bon voyage</i>,&rdquo; but he did grasp the warm
friendliness of the Governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that man has
neither birth nor position in Canada. Your favor to him is not
popular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac's face showed satire. &ldquo;Well, his family were
burghers of Rouen. They were wealthy merchants with the elements of
nobility, and La Salle was trained for a Jesuit. That's why he came
to Canada poor&mdash;training for a Jesuit priest deprived him of
his natural inheritance by the laws of France. I find him
patriotic, unselfish, and sincere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant scowled. &ldquo;Sincere&mdash;a wild discoverer
who sought to reach the Vermilion Sea on the way to China, and
that's why his little Seigneury above Montreal was called La
Chine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac sardonically replied; &ldquo;La Chine! a good name,
and his China will be here. He need not discover China. There is
enough discovery here to last a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau smiled satirically. &ldquo;<i>Bon voyage</i> to Sieur
de la Salle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon voyage</i>, it shall be. Before him lies a wonder
of achievement. History will record him, France will be proud of
him, this continent will adore him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His brother, the Abb&eacute; Cavelier, does not adore
him, Your Excellency. He is older and a good priest, and often
disapproves of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Abb&eacute; Cavelier is a priest of St. Sulpice. He
received part of La Salle's inheritance, and he is cold to La Salle
as are those who receive something for nothing. Is the Abb&eacute;
Cavelier a man of unselfishness and patriotism?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a devoted priest, and Your Excellency should like
him for he is not a Jesuit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac's eyes rested on the statue of Brebeuf. He pointed:
&ldquo;<i>Tiens</i>, there is proof that I love the Jesuit for his
piety, fearlessness, and faith. In all spiritual matters I am his
perfect friend. Now let us to business, Intendant. What surprises
have you! What grievances and public virtues!&rdquo; He spoke
satirically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No surprises. The English and Dutch at Albany, as you
know, mean to get the trade of our Indians and to set the Iroquois
against us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon voyage, Sieur de la Salle!</i>&rdquo; said the
Governor with deep meaning.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter II</h3>

<h3>Have Care, La Salle!</h3>

<p><strong>When</strong> La Salle left the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis,
he walked towards the house of Rojet Ranard, Farmer of the King's
Revenue, where he was an honored guest. The wife of Ranard was
beautiful and her Christian name was Barbe. She, like Ranard, was a
Jesuit and full of hatred for the man who had growing power in the
country and had vast influence already with the Indians. La Salle
had hesitated to accept the invitation, but did so because it might
lessen Jesuit opposition; and so far nothing could have been more
charming than Monsieur and Madame Ranard's treatment of him. They
had a comfortable house just inside St. John's Gate, with a
splendid view over the St. Lawrence, and he had been used with
handsome familiarity.</p>

<p>Barbe Ranard was fair-haired, buoyant, graceful, slim, and of a
vivacious temperament. She was quick of tongue, clever at repartee,
and had the manner of the accomplished woman of the type of De
Montespan and that class who prey upon the susceptibilities of men
and their love of the beautiful and amusing. Barbe Ranard, at
twenty-four, had beauty and distinction and was now the mistress of
Duchesneau, who guessed why La Salle had been asked to stay with
the Farmer of the King's Revenue. The Intendant would do much to
destroy La Salle, and this way seemed possible and sure. Ranard,
who did not know Duchesneau's relations with his wife&mdash;or
pretended not to do so&mdash;was bent to secure advancement, and by
playing up to Duchesneau and the Jesuits, saw his chance. He was a
man of slower wit than his wife, but of straggling force and with a
soul for mean things as had she, or they could not have plotted as
they did.</p>

<p>When La Salle reached Montneuve, he entered full of joy at his
interview with Frontenac and was going to his room, when he was met
in the hall by his hostess.</p>

<p>She held up a hand in greeting: &ldquo;Ah, dear monsieur, it is
good we meet, for I wish a little talk, if you are not too busy. In
my boudoir if you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes were laughing and innocent and she was becomingly
dressed in a severely plain gown of pale gray, cut very low in
front and showing soft shy breasts; and there was naught around her
gracious neck save the glow of perfect health. Her golden hair hung
in profusion, and her lips were like ripe cherries, soft, amorous,
and tempting. As she ran up the stairs softly, La Salle could see
her dress was pulled up so that her fine ankles showed, and her
stockings were of tender pink. She was, as women go, a flower of
the garden of Hesperides, and made a picture that to a lesser man
than La Salle would have been all captivating. He had eyes for
women, for grace and beauty, but there was that far deeper in his
life&mdash;love of his work&mdash;and all else must yield to
that.</p>

<p>Inside her boudoir, an exquisite room, brightly colored with
silk and linen of grace and sweet design, she motioned him to a
sofa, while she took a huge armchair beside the sofa. As La Salle
sat down his mind was busy. Why had she brought him? It was as
sweet a room as he had ever entered in Canada, and appealed to the
sensuous side of him. For a few moments she gazed at him with a
curious warm light in her eyes and sweet seduction in her carriage.
She was essentially one of the women who helped at last to bring
the French Revolution, and who have been at once the flaming morn
and the somber sunset of more than one great land. She had brains
to go far and she would go far; and this enterprise meant that
favor with people in high places which could advance her own and
her husband's interests&mdash;with the all-powerful Jesuit body,
and with court life through Jacques Duchesneau, who stood well in
France. She would have played for Frontenac, but he was too old,
too uncertain, and he was opposed by the Jesuits, whose career he
was retarding in Canada. Besides, Frontenac was not subject to
women's wiles. He had, like La Salle, an ambition that was the
State and its power. He was not selfish, but he was always, and to
the end, the devout lover of France and her advancement. Barbe
Ranard read him as such women do, with vital inseeing. She had the
gift of the perfect Delilah.</p>

<p>Never had she looked better than she did this afternoon. She had
no soul, but she had a marvelously sensitive temperament, and she
was full of emotion, but was incapable of fidelity or true feeling.
She was not immoral, she was non-moral. She could not see the
vileness in her own mind and body. Truth and honor had never been a
part of her, and never could be. From her birth she had gone the
crooked path. Well born, she had married Rojet Ranard because he
was in the Government, and her fixed idea was to get foot on the
ladder and let her brains, body, and good fortune do the rest.</p>

<p>After a few moments in which she tried to impress the senses of
La Salle, she said: &ldquo;You have the mind that wins, Sieur de la
Salle. You were trained for a Jesuit priest, but the wider things
caught you&mdash;not the bigger things, but the wider things, and
you would now do immense things for the land you love&mdash;we both
love. I hate to say it, but I have studied you while you have
stayed with us, and all I see makes me know the really patriotic
thing is in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blushed slightly and lowered her eyes with the skill of her
wonderful duplicity, and she added, almost brokenly: &ldquo;I
should like to help you&mdash;oh, I should! You will do so much for
France in Canada! Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle was impressed. It was an age when women played upon the
senses of the biggest men. In sudden unsuspicious sympathy he half
stretched a hand towards her, and she slid forward on her knees,
buried her face in her hands and wept some fickle and easily
commanded tears.</p>

<p>He almost touched her, but suddenly he felt it was not right to
do so as a guest in the house, or at all, and in a voice of some
emotion he said: &ldquo;You are all too kind, madame. I wish I
could accept your help, but I may not&mdash;I must not do
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why must you not?&rdquo; she sobbed, and bent over so
that he could look down between her most attractive breasts and
could smell the exquisite perfume she used. It was this act of hers
that brought him to his feet in his fight for safety and
escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no I cannot accept your aid. You are not of the
women one can meet in affairs of business and let it stay at that.
No, no, madame, it must not be. It cannot be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and threw her hands on his shoulders.
&ldquo;Oh, La Salle, most dear and wonderful La Salle, let me give
you my help in all you do. I can influence so many&mdash;I can be
what no wife could ever be to you. Can you not see, La
Salle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He withdrew her hands from his shoulders, looked her in the
eyes, and felt her utter shamelessness, her disregard of all the
conventions of life, the utter rule of sex in her, and he said,
firmly, &ldquo;It shall not be,&rdquo; and hastened to the door and
opened it.</p>

<p>Outside stood Rojet Ranard, who had helped to plan this hideous
thing. Glancing back, La Salle saw Barbe with bitter passion in her
eyes and lip curled in revolt. With a look of contempt at Ranard he
left the house in anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God save us!&rdquo; he said, in stern appeal. &ldquo;Is
this what I shall have to face? Henceforth those two are against
me&mdash;and the Jesuits and the Court folk behind
them&mdash;Duchesneau and his kind here and in Paris.&rdquo; He
went to old quarters he had known before and sent to Montneuve for
his clothes.</p>

<p>Behind in Montneuve the humiliated wife said: &ldquo;Rojet, that
man has the nerve of the devil and the blood of an icicle. He has
escaped us, and he will go on&mdash;curse him, like an eagle
flamboyant&mdash;unless we do for him in another way. Yet he is
handsome, too, in his grim way and I could almost have wished we
were not playing a part. He has big things in him or he could not
have withstood me. I am not easy to withstand, am I, dear
Rojet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one could withstand you, Barbe, who was not sunk in
his own importance. That man is a danger here, and we have failed.
I almost wish I had challenged him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A queer smile passed over the face of Barbe as she turned her
head away. &ldquo;He is a trained swordsman, Rojet, and you would
have had a hard time. You did not mean to kill him, but to drive
him from Quebec. It could have been done so easily if he had taken
me in his arms&mdash;so easily!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy as eating. Not Frontenac&mdash;he is La Salle's
friend&mdash;but the Intendant and the Jesuits would have made life
unbearable for him here. He would have been ruined&mdash;and
forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be ruined <i>forever</i> yet,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Do you think a woman ever forgives such a slight? No, no,
no! See you, Rojet, I will pursue him wherever he goes, till I
defeat him in the end. He shall pay to the last centime for what he
did today. Does he think he is bigger than Barbe Ranard? He shall
see. I have brains. I have what he has not, duplicity. See
you&rdquo;&mdash;the beautiful savage teeth showed in menace, the
blue eyes danced fire. &ldquo;I will fight him every step of his
way. He defeated me to-day. I will spend life and time in putting a
blight on all he does, I will prevent his fame coming to fruition.
When he goes to France&mdash;he is going, he told me so
yesterday&mdash;I will be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should he go to France?&rdquo; he asked: &ldquo;What
can he do there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her brilliant eyes answered. There flashed into them the look
that has entered the brains of such women as Medea, or Lady
Macbeth, and she said with ruthless lips: &ldquo;Why indeed? It
will be not so difficult to make France impossible. I see my
way&mdash;I see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranard laughed. &ldquo;You have resources, Barbe. If you say you
will do a thing, it is done one way or another in the end. See,
there has lately come into my employ a clever man from the North,
Tuke Darois, who hates La Salle, and Du Lhut, the great <i>coureur
de bois</i>, and we can use him at need. He has an eye for dark
things&mdash;I see that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tuke Darois! I like the &lsquo;Tuke,&rsquo; it has dark
possibilities. Who is the man? What has been his work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been a trapper in the far North. His wife was
Scotch and he has a daughter, a very pretty girl of eighteen or so.
She is not like him&mdash;looks straight and honest; but he! well,
behind his calm face is the soul of the devil. He is a most capable
accountant, so I employ him. I have clearly instructed him to watch
Du Lhut, and I know he hates La Salle&mdash;why I know
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe smiled. &ldquo;Good, my Rojet. All comes our way. That man
should help in good time&mdash;and his daughter, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;No, she is of a different breed. I
don't think we can use her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let me try.&rdquo; Her face took on a look of
rancor.</p>

<p>She turned to a table and picked up a letter. &ldquo;I see one
way here&mdash;in this letter. Read it. There's no reason why you
should not. It is one of many that come into my life. Read it,
Rojet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the letter and read it, and a sour smile passed over his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicolas Perrot, the explorer, too, and in love with you.
What will come of this? What a fool to write like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a fool of a letter, though. It tells the honest
mind of the man. Suppose I&rdquo;&mdash;she drew his head to her
mouth and whispered. &ldquo;Suppose&mdash;<i>that!</i> And when it
is done, he cannot compel me&mdash;do you see, because by accident
you had discovered the part he played&mdash;do you not see? La
Salle goes to the West before he goes to France. If not there, then
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranard was a bad man and lived in an age of good and evil, with,
on the whole, the dominance of good, yet he almost shrank from the
vile plot in her mind. He looked at her&mdash;so fair, and yet so
black with dishonor behind her radiant face and exquisite hair and
luring eyes! He felt stunned, for wickedness should not go with so
much charm and soft luxuriance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the eternal, you have the thing that knows not
eclipse! You have no soul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't say that. I am confessed and pardoned and go on
again as before. No soul&mdash;eh, la la&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you confess all your sins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all at once. Life is not so short as that. But a sin
committed for the Church is forgiven. So I shall be
forgiven&mdash;always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head in pretended horror. &ldquo;When shall you see
Nicolas Perrot? He is in Quebec, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw him on Wednesday, and I can have him here at
any time, and with your consent I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send for him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better. La Salle has raised what he cannot
lay. He shall pay to the utmost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her note was of the briefest, &ldquo;Dear Monsieur, come at
once, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she had dusted the ink and folded and sealed the letter,
she said, &ldquo;How long do you think La Salle can contend against
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes were still bitter, her cheek was flushed, her lithe
figure was tense, and yet, resist it as she would, a longing for La
Salle was on her. All the more she would destroy him&mdash;the
paramount fool!</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as he lives, no longer,&rdquo; said Ranard, with
enmity. &ldquo;His sun does not rise far,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>She rang a bell and a man-servant entered. &ldquo;Bear this to
M. Nicolas Perrot at Terre Bonne House, and answer no questions. Do
you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man bowed his head. &ldquo;Perfectly, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a queer look in Auguste's eyes. He had borne messages
before to M. Duchesneau, and he was well paid for his services. If
he betrayed his mistress, his life would end, and he knew it. He
was a man of sound judgment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come soon, Nicolas,&rdquo; said Barbe Ranard, aloud, with
a satirical smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will not tarry. I go to my office,&rdquo; said
Ranard.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter III</h3>

<h3>The Man That Mattered</h3>

<p><strong>Barbe Ranard</strong> was not long alone. She heard a
voice in the hall, and in a moment the Intendant was in the room.
He bowed over her hand and kissed it with passion, but malevolence
was in his eyes. She saw both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear monsieur?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You
have news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always coming from the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, I have
news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it now, Jacques?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only that Frontenac and La Salle are closer than ever,
and La Salle is going West&mdash;&lsquo;Bon Voyage, Sieur de la
Salle,&rsquo; said Frontenac, and I said it later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going West&mdash;yes, but he goes to France
also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been staying here, and he told me yesterday. What
he is going for I know not and I care not. He left this house in
anger a half-hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In anger&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is quick tempered, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said something in jest, and he left in a fury. He is
never returning here,&rdquo; she added viciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your humor is not bitter to your guests, I'm sure of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never found it so. I'll tell you what I tried to do.
He was too hard to move, so he left us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then told Duchesneau much, and at first he quivered with
anger; then he burst into laughter at the failure of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were balked, then, for the first time in your life.
So that was your jest&mdash;a scurvy one&mdash;and he shall pay for
it! You were working for a good end&mdash;he is a danger to this
province of great Louis. He is a foe of the Jesuits who are my
uncompromising support. So, I am grateful to you, Barbe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did I do it? For you and our friends, and, as it is,
I will publish in a quiet way at the Sainte Famille on Thursday,
that he courted me and that I rejected him with scorn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms. &ldquo;Your love is as deep as
mine&mdash;and deeper&mdash;eh, my Barbe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drank the sweetness of her lips, and for a moment she lay
quiescent in his arms. Suddenly, however, she disengaged
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is madness in the daytime in my salon. It is
madness. Suppose a servant entered&mdash;suppose my husband
came!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is worth running risks for a million times, and it
is good he does not know. Are you sure he does not know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She showed her pretty teeth. &ldquo;I am sure of naught in this
sad world except you. I cannot think he knows, or he would not be
so loving to me. We worked together as to La Salle, but why should
he as to you? That was pretense&mdash;this is reality&mdash;don't
you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He inclined his head. &ldquo;Of course. Now see: we must deal
roughly with La Salle. He is not under my control&mdash;only that
of Frontenac, who is his friend. But I can cripple him
indirectly&mdash;as to trade and supplies, as to finance. I can set
people in Quebec against him. They are increasing steadily. We must
retard him in every way, and the end is ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The end shall be ours beyond doubt,&rdquo; was Barbe's
reply. &ldquo;Beloved, it is not wise to stay longer. I expect one
whom I shall use against La Salle. He is a rugged son of New France
in his own line of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't think who it is,&rdquo; said Duchesneau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not try to guess, but go now, best beloved,
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant would have embraced her again, but she refused,
and he kissed her hand avidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will you come to me?&rdquo; he entreated.</p>

<p>She declined to say. &ldquo;There is always faithful
Auguste,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter IV</h3>

<h3>The First Fort in the West</h3>

<p><strong>Frontenac</strong> made the journey to Lake Ontario to
build a fort and cement relations with the Five Nations Indians who
almost controlled the new West and were being influenced by the
English and the Dutch of New York. They had no great power on the
water, but were very strong on land. Combination was their
secret.</p>

<p>The center of their power was the Long House, where in goodly
numbers they lived, sometimes five hundred at a time. It was like
living in at college. It bred a tribal spirit, a sense of
communion, of purpose, of identity, and even those they conquered,
whom they did not kill and eat, felt it. The palace of Versailles
was the same. It combined, it produced a settled system. It brought
the nobles under the direct influence of the King. It simplified
government. It did in a week in administration of government what
would have taken a month in Paris.</p>

<p>Frontenac had sent La Salle to Onondaga, the headquarters of the
Iroquois, to invite their chiefs to council at Cataraqui, now
Kingston. Frontenac ordered the people of Quebec and Montreal to
furnish armed men and canoes, and asked regular and militia
officers in the province to accompany him. At the beginning of June
he left with his guard, his staff, volunteers, and part of the
guard of the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis.</p>

<p>At Montreal he was received by the governor, Perrot, a nominee
of the Jesuits, his soldiers and the people, and, after salutation
of firearms and speeches, went to the fort, where means was taken
to prevent his proceeding, even by the lie that a Dutch fleet had
taken Boston and were about to attack Quebec. But Frontenac would
not be beguiled. So, with four hundred men, one hundred and twenty
canoes, and two large flatboats painted in strange devices to
dazzle the Iroquois, he moved westward. On their way disaster
almost overcame them, owing to bad weather and swollen waters. They
made their way slowly but bravely, sometimes in flood to the knees
or their armpits, feet cut by stones, and nearly swept away, but
they toiled on, the Indians working under Frontenac as they worked
for no one else save such as La Salle. Frontenac's authoritative
spirit was to their liking and they obeyed him. Frontenac, without
his cloak and drenched, directed them, and once he lay awake,
anxious lest the biscuits should be wet&mdash;this would have meant
the failure of the mission. But Frontenac, the once admired darling
of the court of the Sun King, was a born pioneer, and asked men to
do naught which he would not do himself. That was the character of
the man in an era of feudalism, with the gifts and habits of
democracy; he would have been successful in any age or time.</p>

<p>On the way, and beyond the Thousand Islands, a canoe brought La
Salle to Frontenac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now, La Salle?&rdquo; he said, warmly, as La Salle
stepped into his canoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All well, Your Excellency! They are in big numbers at
Cataraqui, but I beg you go as to a great battle with all force
arrayed. Nothing impresses Indians like show of power in the
Governor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac smiled. &ldquo;You have the gift for the Indian mind,
La Salle,&rdquo; and nodded.</p>

<p>It was an imposing sight&mdash;four divisions in the first line,
after which two flatboats filled with men, then himself and La
Salle, the guards, the staff, and the gentlemen volunteers,
followed by canoes and two remaining divisions. Slowly they went to
Cataraqui and met on the shore vast numbers of Iroquois, who had
been amazed by the show of strength, the display of the old
soldiers of the Carignan-Salli&egrave;res regiment, and the
uniforms of the Governor's guard.</p>

<p>The next morning the drums beat and all were drawn up under
arms. A double line of men extended from Frontenac's tent to the
Indian camp, and along this line sixty savage deputies came to the
council. The deputies squatted on the sails of the flatboats in a
ring and smoked their pipes. Once La Salle stooped and whispered to
a chief called Garakonti&eacute;, a friend of the French, and
grunts of applause came from the Indians. At length Frontenac, La
Salle, and his officers were all seated. They surveyed the
assembled Indians, taking measure of their mettle, and gifts to the
Iroquois were made ready. Behind the Indian warriors stood the
squaws who had influence with their men.</p>

<p>At length Garakonti&eacute; rose and in the name of the Five
Nations paid deference and respect to Frontenac in a friendly
speech to which his chiefs said loudly, &ldquo;Hoh! Hoh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Frontenac in his splendid uniform spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children! Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and
Senecas, I am glad to see you here, where I have had a fire lighted
for you to smoke by and for me to talk to you. You have done well,
my children, to obey the command of your father. Take
courage&mdash;you will hear his voice, which is full of power and
tenderness. For do not think I have come to make war. My mind is
full of peace and she walks by my side. Courage then, children, and
take rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the long speech the gifts were distributed&mdash;cloth,
tinseled dresses, tobacco, beads. Never before had a Governor
addressed them as &ldquo;Children,&rdquo; but always as
&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; and yet this did not offend them, for
Frontenac was dominant and decisive, and behind him was force. They
would not have borne it from another. They accepted with applause,
for they knew a man when they saw him. Frontenac gave guns to the
men, and prunes and raisins and dried fruits to the wives and
children.</p>

<p>This was the preliminary meeting. Afterwards the fort was begun,
and the Indians were astounded at the order and alacrity of the
work. Meanwhile Frontenac asked the chiefs constantly to his table,
fondled the Iroquois children, gave them sweetmeats, and feasted
the squaws, and they all danced before him. When the fort was
nearly finished, Frontenac held a grand council with state and
ceremony. His perceptions were remarkable. He felt the Indians as
an artist feels the true atmosphere of a man, or a place.</p>

<p>He spoke, begging them to become Christians, and his conscience
and his policy were at one in this. His tone was soft and gentle.
Then he changed it, and he said, pointing to his troops:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your father can come so far to make you a visit of
friendship, what would he do if you should rouse his anger, so that
he must punish his disobedient children? He is the arbiter of peace
and war. Beware how you offend him. You must not molest Indian
friends of the French&mdash;other tribes and peoples.&rdquo; He
added, sharply, that he would chastise them for any breaches of the
peace.</p>

<p>After these threats he spoke with paternal kindness, saying he
meant to build at Cataraqui a storehouse where they could buy all
they needed. They must not listen to bad men, but only to such as
Sieur de la Salle, whom he asked now to address them.</p>

<p>La Salle had in mind the dreadful Iroquois in the past, and
recalled when Father Poncet, after sleeping in dank weeds, had
colic as he waded waist deep through a noxious stream&mdash;how his
feet were blistered, his legs benumbed. The priest begged for a
bowl of broth and he was given wild plums, and only at night as he
lay fainting did he receive the broth. At last an old Indian took
his hands, examined them, and told a child of five years old to cut
off the left forefinger with a knife, which he did while Poncet
sang the &ldquo;Vexilla Regis.&rdquo; This was one of the
innumerable tortures the fathers had borne at the hands of the
Iroquois.</p>

<p>La Salle had great gifts of simple utterance, no rhetoric, no
eloquence; his was straight and forceful speech, and he knew how to
speak to Indians. His words were a true supplement to those of the
Governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brothers, friends,&rdquo; he said, while Frontenac
listened, delighted, &ldquo;we have far to go together. The
Governor gives me control of this fort. Food and supplies will
come, and you shall have what you need in return for your peltries.
In me you have a friend. I would not deceive you. My life among you
will prove my fidelity. Brothers of the Five Nations, the French
are your friends&mdash;King Louis, greatest of monarchs, is your
father. He is of vast power and in Count Frontenac he sends one of
his mightiest here. This Governor is kind, but he is firm and
strong, and under him you may rest in peace and prosper. Here at
Fort Frontenac is your <i>cache</i> for all good things. Brothers,
I give you greeting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this was well received&mdash;Indians shouting &ldquo;Hoh!
Hoh!&rdquo; and the calumet chant was sung as the Indians rose to
their feet and tramped round. The calumet is like a flag of truce
and is the sign of good will and peace. This was the chant:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Heia, Heia,
Yonkennonou&eacute;.<br></span> <span class="line0">Heia, Heia,
Yonkennonou&eacute;.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>The mission had been successful, and Frontenac left Cataraqui to
the loud applause of the Iroquois. It was clear that the fort, with
the aid of a vessel, could command Lake Ontario, help to keep peace
with the Iroquois, and stop the trade with the English. With a fort
at Niagara and another vessel on Lake Erie the French could command
all the upper lakes. All this was part of La Salle's scheme.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter V</h3>

<h3>The Fountain of Power</h3>

<p><strong>With</strong> letters of commendation from Frontenac to
Colbert, the great minister of King Louis, La Salle, went to
France, but Barbe Ranard preceded him, knowing his purposes.</p>

<p>She had naught save malice for La Salle. The Intendant had
written to Colbert that La Salle was a madman and should receive no
favors from the King. To the enmity of the priests was added the
malice of a woman who had failed of her purpose, and who, in truth,
cared for La Salle in her own vicious, curious way.</p>

<p>Her bitterness came from defeat. Her husband had made much money
in Canada, and she felt that at court she could defeat La Salle at
every corner. She knew well the Abb&eacute; Potin, who was a
prominent figure at court, the confessor of De Montespan, and the
faithful friend of the Jesuits of Canada, and to him she went on
arrival.</p>

<p>The apartments of the Abb&eacute; were near those of the Prince
de Conti, Louis Armand de Bourbon, a cousin of King Louis, and a
younger brother of the great Cond&eacute; who had influence at
court and was a favorite of King Louis.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; lived outwardly with austerity, but he had
luxurious tastes and, though a Jesuit, had license from the Pope to
spend money freely for the good of the Church. He had a mind not
wholly Eden-like and a great vanity, for he was handsome and his
cassock was ever scrupulously clean and fitted well his lean and
graceful figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, my charming madame, you have come back to the gilded
cage,&rdquo; he said to Barbe when she kissed his hand.</p>

<p>Her bright eyes shone as she said, &ldquo;To the cage, yes, from
the aviary, and it has nests of many strange birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; caught her meaning and he motioned her to a
seat. Then he looked at her meditatively for a moment and said,
&ldquo;So I have heard, and another of the birds is to visit the
court soon.&rdquo; He saw her surprise and added, &ldquo;You see, I
have the clairvoyant sense, <i>p&eacute;tite madame</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it clairvoyance or an excellent correspondent in
Quebec?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled with a subtle look in his eyes. &ldquo;I speak of a
foe of my Order who is coming to France. His name is Robert
Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle, and he has a brother an abb&eacute;,
an old acquaintance of mine. So I may be
clairvoyant&mdash;eh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I wished to pay humble respects to you, and to
tell you of La Salle I come to you soon after I landed,
Abb&eacute;. La Salle has come for favors from the court, and your
Order in Canada and the Intendant wish to stay his hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as a true daughter of the Order, you would serve us
with your beauty and your intellect&mdash;eh, madame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She read the double meaning in his words, yet only a flash of
resentment came to her eyes. Such men as he, long trained in court
life, could not easily be deceived, and she replied, &ldquo;All I
am is at the service of our Order, so I come direct to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly his manner changed. The careful, benignant look fled
from his face and a steely expression came. He leaned a forearm on
his knee and looked her steadily in the eyes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish me to help you, so let us bargain with clear
minds. It is not our Order alone, though you are faithful to it,
but you would not come to France at great expense for that alone.
You hate La Salle, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, then conquered by his infrangible mind and the
danger of deception, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as you say, and for good reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled subtly. &ldquo;I know. You would have done a good
thing for our Order, and, resisting you, you loathed him, and now
you would bring him to naught at the court of the King. Is it
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had regained her composure and she looked at him with the
eyes of a child, and her sensitive smiling mouth told what she felt
more surely than her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, be sure it is that&mdash;but first it was for our
Order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for the Intendant, the foe of La Salle and
Frontenac?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now she flushed slightly and inclined her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you would have played with La Salle in spite of
Duchesneau?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman is never sure of herself till she is tried to the
full, M. l'Abb&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so, I understand. You have the big thing in you,
and we shall find you successful at Court, Madame Barbe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lingered over the last word, for it was a challenge of her
purity of life. She understood, and she could not resist, for this
man could help her in what she would do, and he was handsome and
graceful, and if he had not been a priest&mdash;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your help, dear Abb&eacute;, I hope to defeat La
Salle. He is a menace to the good of that land where our Order
ruled so well and so long. Under Laval's influence Canada did well;
under Frontenac not so well. He grows rich with trade, and the land
grows poorer. As Frontenac has increased, Canada has
decreased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand. We have now clear way to walk and we must
find what to do. The great Colbert&mdash;you would meet him? I can
get to him through his son, Marquis de Seignelay. I expect him here
to day. His message said he wished to see me&mdash;I know not on
what business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment came a soft knocking on the door, and a Jesuit
brother entered. He held a card in his hand. The Abb&eacute; took
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admit him:&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was about to leave, but the Abb&eacute;, tapping her cheek
with a finger, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, meet him before you go. It is well worth
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay entered. He was to become Naval Minister soon. The
Abb&eacute; saluted him with deference, and he turned to Barbe. The
Abb&eacute; said: &ldquo;Madam Ranard has just come from Quebec,
Monsieur. May I present her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay gave Barbe his hand, which she kissed, then a curious
look flashed across his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of the fame and position of madame. Has she
a special mission here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Monsieur would allow me to call on him one day I could
make all clear. It could not be done in a few words. But may I,
Monsieur?&rdquo; Barbe added, with an ingratiating smile, for the
minister looked like one who could be impressed by a clever, pretty
woman. Yet a queer look came into the Abb&eacute;'s eyes. <i>He</i>
knew that Seignelay was not easily moved by women&mdash;had he not
seen it with the friends of the King's favorites, Valli&egrave;re,
Fontanges, De Montespan and De Maintenon.</p>

<p>Seignelay said to her: &ldquo;I shall welcome madame to-morrow
at twelve noon at Versailles&mdash;if that may please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe curtsied. &ldquo;I will joy to wait upon
Monseigneur,&rdquo; and she met the enigmatical look in Seignelay's
eyes with no real understanding. With a deep bow to them, both she
left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have known madame long, Abb&eacute;? Handsome but not
of noble family, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have known her ten years, Monsieur. She is not of noble
family, but she married one in the government&mdash;Rojet Ranard,
Farmer of His Majesty's revenue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah yes. I have heard&mdash;a man who blinks an eye, I
fear. She plays a part with&mdash;one who matters in Canada. Now,
Abb&eacute;&rdquo;&mdash;with a friendly wave of the
hand&mdash;&ldquo;you can do the King's Government service by
seeing the learned Abb&eacute; Renaudot. I would have him get from
Madame Frontenac the latest inside news of her husband. He and she
have not lived together many years, but she is a sagely clever
woman, and she has, though poor, wide influence, yet she never
appears at Court. She is the daughter of La Grange Trianon and once
close friend of Montpensier, Louis' cousin, but they fell apart.
She is still beautiful. She is devoted to his interests, and my
father would know what Frontenac tells her about the Intendant and
Indian affairs. They get official reports, but more is
needed&mdash;if administration is to be handled well. Only one like
Abb&eacute; Renaudot could gain her confidence, and he would do
that for the King, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, I will do what I can. I know the abb&eacute;
fairly well. We are all patriots, are we not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay took a pinch of snuff and offered his box to the
Abb&eacute;. He ignored the remark about patriotism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are bad days in Canada, Abb&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet never better in France, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, never better in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;France has gone farther than in all her
history&mdash;thanks to your father, Monseigneur Colbert,
Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the King,&rdquo; said Seignelay, with a
reproving smile.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter VI</h3>

<h3>La Salle and Abb&eacute; Renaudot</h3>

<p><strong>La Salle</strong> lodged in the Rue de la Truanderie at
Paris, and he presently came to know the Abb&eacute; Renaudot, whom
he met at the house of Comtesse Frontenac and with whom he
immediately made friendship. The society at the home of Madame
Frontenac and Mademoiselle Outrelaise did not appeal to him, for he
was shy by nature, but he had from madame assurances that she would
do all in her power for him, though her influence with the court
was not direct.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Renaudot had seen the Abb&eacute; Potin, and had
accepted the commission to get from Madame Frontenac information,
but to get it openly, and he presently told the countess all.</p>

<p>She smiled, for she had been a close friend of Madame de
Montpensier&mdash;the granddaughter of Henry IV and cousin of King
Louis XIV&mdash;and she knew Court life well&mdash;but she worked
for Frontenac from outside, and she gave the Abb&eacute; all she
could with intelligence and discrimination.</p>

<p>To La Salle she said, before he left her house:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you shall always be welcome, Sieur de la Salle, and
we will help you when we can.&rdquo; She had still great beauty and
charm and wit, and he trusted her and liked her much.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Renaudot was at once taken to his heart, for he
was learned, reliable, a patriot, and superbly honest, and La Salle
saw that at once. La Salle had few gifts for ingratiating himself
at Court, and could not push his cause like most among his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>So it was the Abb&eacute; Renaudot came to see him with a rarely
aroused interest. He had many talks with La Salle in the rooms in
the Rue de la Truanderie, and he learned of La Salle's troubles,
ambitions, and enterprises.</p>

<p>La Salle made it clear to the Abb&eacute; Renaudot that
Frontenac had resource and determination and was to play a big part
in the history of New France. His faults were on the
surface&mdash;a quick temper, a stern will to have his dignity
recognized, but a consummate courage where he had to contend
against the Church and the Intendant, and the difficult, lawless
folk of a new land.</p>

<p>Duchesneau had declared that Frontenac used the <i>coureurs de
bois</i> to promote trade, compelled the Indians to pay his guards
for protecting them, and he never allowed the inhabitants to trade
until the Indians had given him packs of beaver skins, which he
called &ldquo;presents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle said to the Abb&eacute; Renaudot: &ldquo;There never
was a man who served the King more faithfully than he, and time and
history will prove this. The best proof is he has taken the harder
course&mdash;he has fought the old, powerful body of Jesuits, and
they have fought him with the concentrated force of the Church.
There was a time when four-fifths of the funds of the Province went
to the Church, and there must come an end to that&mdash;<i>there
must!</i> A lesser man would have sought the easier way. He chose
the harder, and he is poor. He has not enough salary to support
him. The man who did the most for Canada preceding Frontenac was
Talon. That handsome man with his oval face and his shower of
curls, his smooth features, the mouth formed for feminine
sensibility than for masculine force, did great work; he opened the
field for Frontenac. Talon prepared the way for Frontenac, my
unconquerable leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then La Salle told the Abb&eacute; of Madame Ranard, of her
presence in France now, to spoil his chances of help in his
explorations from the King and Colbert, and of her trap with her
husband, for himself. He also said she was a member of a Jesuit
society called the Sainte Famille, which met every Thursday at the
cathedral with closed doors, where they told of all that had
happened during the week, and nothing was told against the Jesuits.
It was a sort of female inquisition, and the week after the trap
had been laid for La Salle, Barbe told the assembled ladies of La
Salle's attempt to conquer her virtue and of the opportune arrival
of her husband. She told it with tears in her evil, beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>So it was that many left the Sainte Famille believing La Salle
guilty of the crime, though there was no supporting evidence from
his past history. Yet Barbe had done her work well, and, were it
not that her relations with Duchesneau were guessed, there would
have been greater effect, but it had set the unthinking against La
Salle.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; shifted in his seat. &ldquo;If Bishop Laval
gives assent to this evil society, it is a dangerous precedent. We
have naught like it in France, and the King would not permit
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laid a hand on La Salle's knee: &ldquo;You were wise to come
to France, and all will go well. You have foes, but you can
overcome them. I do not fear the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle lifted his head in gratitude. &ldquo;You are a good
friend, Abb&eacute;, but I have not met my powerful foes here.
Duchesneau, the Intendant, has written, and Madame Ranard is here,
and she can bring big guns to bear. An able lying woman is a
dangerous foe.&rdquo; His eyes became darker in anxiety, his face
looked troubled. &ldquo;I can fight men&mdash;I know their
games&mdash;but I cannot fight women. I am at sea till I find what
she has done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has seen the Abb&eacute; Potin, who came to me
concerning the Comtesse Frontenac, and she has seen
Seignelay&mdash;this I know&mdash;and also the Prince de Conti, who
married a daughter of the King, Mademoiselle de Blois, and has
tried to influence him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prince de Conti, eh, that great man, and twice most
kind to me. He is interested in exploration, and I counted on his
help. I named a post after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think she influenced him? But not at all. No woman,
however adroit, can deceive him. He is sending here to-day Henri de
Tonty, an Italian officer whose father was Governor of Gaeta and
had to flee from Naples to France. In France he has invented the
Tontine insurance policy and here his son has come&mdash;a young
man of powerful intellect and great charm, as you shall see. He has
a metal hand, for one was blown off at Libieso in the Sicilian
wars. He became a captain. The Prince Conti has sent him, and that
shows Madame Ranard has not influenced the great cousin of the
King. I see in young De Tonty a comrade of yours. He has tact and
skill, and the loyalty and enthusiasm of the Italian. He is poor,
but he has what you lack, the great social gift, though he cannot
impress people better with his honesty. Your foes are powerful, but
the good God is with the right thing, and for you there shall be a
secure future. You need one like Tonty with you. You can trust him,
and able men in France are few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's figure became more restful. &ldquo;Dear Abb&eacute;,
you have helped me much already. I shall be glad to see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall see him now, I think, for there is a knocking
at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence a moment, and then a servant entered and said,
&ldquo;Monsieur de Tonty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty entered, a tall spare figure with a face of dark color
lightened by a pair of brilliant honest eyes with a feeling that
comes of the soul within&mdash;the soul of a fighter, whose own
native land was denied him, and who looked at La Salle after the
first greetings with eager eyes. What La Salle saw pleased him. He
felt he could trust this man, who was the more appealing because of
his metal left hand covered with a glove. He gave his right hand to
La Salle, of whom he had heard, not always to his credit. But Tonty
was a man who formed his own judgment, and that the Prince de Conti
had sent him was sufficient.</p>

<p>La Salle smiled at him, and in the frank smile was a covert
invitation, for at once La Salle wished to work with him. Tonty had
the prodigious gift&mdash;he was a man of character, and he was, as
the Abb&eacute; has said, unmarried and free for a life of peril
and adventure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come from the Prince de Conti to a valued friend
whom all France trusts&mdash;the Abb&eacute; here. We are
fortunate, for men of trust are not plentiful in these
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute;'s smile was that of content, for he saw these
two men had made alliance of the heart already, and the way of
success was more possible to La Salle. He knew that La Salle was
lacking in those lighter qualities which Tonty had, and with
character, too. He had the insight of the perfect priest who sees
men as they not always see themselves, for his class are removed
from the ambitions that influence others, and see more clearly than
the average man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sieur de la Salle has been telling me of life in Canada,
and it is thrilling. It is full of danger and anxiety, but it is
the upbuilding of an Empire of the West.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty smiled and nodded. &ldquo;I cannot return to Naples to
build empire there, and France is now my nation. I would help build
up New France. There is this drawback, of
course&rdquo;&mdash;lifting up his metal hand&mdash;&ldquo;but it
would not prevent me, if I got the chance&mdash;if I got
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked La Salle in the eyes, and La Salle said: &ldquo;There
is naught I wish more than to work with you. I need much a man of
your caliber, for in Canada most men are out against me, even those
I much admire. They are big, and they work against me and with the
Intendant and certain old friends now hostile through trade, and
others. I have far to go before I can win them to me&mdash;far to
go.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter VII</h3>

<h3>At Versailles</h3>

<p><strong>The</strong> court assembled in the vast suite of
apartments decorated by pictures and sculptures, tapestries,
mosaics in light and splendor. Throngs feasted, gamed, promenaded,
talked, and nowhere else in the world was there such magnificence.
The suite was called the &ldquo;Halls of Abundance&rdquo;&mdash;of
Venus, Mars, Diana, Mercury, Apollo; and Louis XIV met in the salon
of Apollo with his courtiers, affable, gracious, august, a marvel
of hard work and love of country, which under him was growing great
and powerful.</p>

<p>Louis was his own Prime Minister and at the head of each
department of state. His brain knew every important detail of every
court in Europe. He formed his own policy and had an organization
throughout France such as no government ever had. He was behind all
the amazing progress of France. He had built it up from a series of
fighting duchies from the days of the Fronde.</p>

<p>Louis has been traduced as the most arrogant ruler, who, a
beardless king of seventeen, after a ride from Vincennes, strode,
whip in hand, into the Parliament of Paris when they were
discussing coinage, and said, sternly: &ldquo;I forbid you, M. le
Pr&eacute;sident, to discuss <i>my</i> edicts.&rdquo; The key to
his policy lay in the words, &ldquo;<i>L'&eacute;tat, C'est
moi</i>.&rdquo; It has been called the sublimity of arrogance; yet
his was the most brilliant reign of any modern French king; under
him science and art flourished. Could it be that a man, however
vain, who was an indefatigable worker, and who by his attitude to
the world and to Canada, his new territory, shows his real nature
by letters of such discernment and even justice, was so bad as has
been painted? At one time he controlled Europe in effect. His army
worshiped him.</p>

<p>We must not view the time of Louis XIV as we view life
to-day&mdash;not in England, America, or in any other country. We
must compare it with contemporary days. So doing, life under Louis
in his seventy-two years' reign was most creditable to France.
Vanity and arrogance are not crimes, else few great men would stand
the test of time, and under Louis' powdered periwig and ringlets
there was a brain of power; under his lace cravat there were a
heart and mind that did honor to France; and behind his
broad-skirted velvet coat and gold-headed cane and diamond-mounted
stud, and jeweled snuff-box there was the courage of a man and the
soul of a statesman. Extravagant he was and he loved display, but
he worked like a slave with his Ministers, and no important detail
escaped him. The letters he wrote to Frontenac and other Governors
and Intendants, and to officials in New France are best tribute to
a rare personality. Under the Generals Cond&eacute; and Turenne,
with Louvois as Minister of War; under Gremonville and Lionne as
ambassadors, with Generals Vauban and Crequi and D'Enghien to
come&mdash;France had reached to greater and greater days.</p>

<p>While the salon was full of courtiers awaiting the entrance of
the Grand Monarch, things were happening on which depended the
future of France in the New World. Were it not for La Salle, the
vast territory from Fort Frontenac to the Gulf of Mexico would not
have been taken in the name of France. We shall see how things went
with La Salle.</p>

<p>It was at the house of the Prince de Conti that a meeting
chanced which would influence the future of Canada. Tonty had given
the Prince the result of his visit to the Abb&eacute; Renaudot, and
Conti heard with pleasure that La Salle had asked Tonty to go to
Canada. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not hear so well of La Salle's prospects as I had
hoped, Tonty. He has bitter, powerful foes. If they influence King
Louis and Colbert and Seignelay I shall have anxiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Your Highness's influence is great at court, and you
can set back the trio against La Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince smiled and tossed his fingers. &ldquo;One never knows
one's influence to be small or large till one tries, and I shall
try to-day, but on the whole La Salle must fight his own fight, win
his own case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle had done his best. He had written Colbert an account of
his discoveries in modest yet convincing terms; had said that the
new country of the far West was so fertile and beautiful that all
could be produced that was produced in France; and more, that
flocks and herds could be left out to pasture all winter, that the
wild cattle had a fine wool for making cloth and hats, that hemp
and cotton grew there naturally, that the Indians would adopt
French ways and modes of life, and it was the knowledge of the
poverty of Quebec, its dense forests, its harsh climate that had
led him to plant colonies in the beautiful lands of the far West.
He wrote of the dangers from the Iroquois and other tribes, the
rapids and cataracts, the cost of men and provisions, and the
rivalry of the English&mdash;of the Hudson's Bay Company and at
Albany. But this last reason only animated La Salle the more and
impelled him to confuse them by promptness of action as to
settlement and forts.</p>

<p>The simplicity and directness of La Salle's appeal had good
effect on Colbert, and he was ready to speak favorably to King
Louis concerning his appeal. But meanwhile La Salle's foes were at
work, and one of the most capable was the Abb&eacute; Potin. But
Colbert, clean of mind and not corruptible, waited his opportunity.
In the far West he saw a new empire for France, and not one to be a
constant drain on the pocket of the King, who gave as freely as he
could. Louis gave bounties on early marriages in Canada. Twenty
livres were given to each youth who married before the age of
twenty, and to each girl before sixteen. This was called the King's
Gift, and exclusive of the dowry given every girl brought over by
his orders, of whom about a thousand were sent over between 1665
and 1673. The dowry was sometimes a home, provisions for eight
months, and often fifty livres and household supplies, and a barrel
of salted meat. Also all <i>habitants</i> of Canada who had living
ten children each received a pension.</p>

<p>Was all this direct out of King Louis' purse the act of a tyrant
and a Nero?</p>

<p>As Prince Conti and Tonty talked in the Prince's house, La Salle
and Barbe Ranard met in his anteroom, for both had come to see him.
La Salle bowed to her with cold courtesy, and she, the perfect
intrigante, came to him with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, M. la Salle, we meet in France at last. May all you
come to do be as the gods decide!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle looked at the insincere eyes, the smiling mouth, the
powdered hair, with no nerve of assent roused, and with repugnance
in his heart, but he said in reply to her equivocal words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As King Louis may decide&mdash;after such advice as
Madame Ranard may give him direct or indirect, right or wrong, just
or unjust, good or bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face was composed as he spoke, but at his lips was a cold,
ironical smile. He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not forget, madame, what happened long ago, nor what
you said at the Sainte Famille. Shall you use the same grotesque
falsehood here in France&mdash;and to the ministers of the
King?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face underwent a sudden change. Her eyes became brilliant
and fierce, her lips had a vicious look:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told the minister what is well known in Quebec. I
have not the gifts of fiction of the explorer. I think my word
counts in France&mdash;my husband is in the Government
service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on La Salle's tongue to say that her husband's wife was
in the service of the Intendant of Canada, but he forbore. He only
said, satirically: &ldquo;Madame is working for Canada here, Of
course. She has the patriot mind and the good of the Church at
heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the strife between man and woman, Monsieur de la
Salle, and in such contests it is not the man who wins. I have the
secret of success in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, in your pocket, madame! I knew you thought you had
it&mdash;but not in your pocket! It is a powerful secret, but it
does not always win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wins when those who matter find it, M. de la
Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall know about that soon, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't that depend on who sees the Minister
last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for me, Madame Ranard, I abide by the customs of the
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the customs of this place so well,
monsieur?&rdquo; There was biting insult in her tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so well as madame, I suppose, but enough to find my
way about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ways are dark, monsieur, and you will lose your path.
You are not on the St. Lawrence or Lake Ontario. You are a
backwoodsman. You do not know the halls of Versailles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a backwoodsman, as you say, yet I came from France
and I am not so verdant. My family were of the Caveliers of Rouen,
and I was educated for the priesthood of the Jesuits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were a master in a Jesuit school!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle flushed slightly, for her tone and manner were
contemptuous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame was never a mistress in a Jesuit school. She is
the donn&eacute;e of the Jesuits now, and what else be the will of
God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe's anger now was great. Stepping close to La Salle, she
slapped his face. &ldquo;You insult a lady like that! If I were a
man I would fight you&mdash;low born, low bred, thief of trade,
tool of Frontenac, grotesque ape of social life, most in debt of
any man of Canada, and most loathed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled coldly. &ldquo;If I am most in debt, it is proof
I am not so much loathed, and as for my breeding, it ranks with
that of a woman and her husband who stooped to the tricks of the
ditch to bring a gentleman into disrepute. If you were a man I
would make the world too small to hold you, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe turned and saw Tonty leaving the Prince de Conti's
salon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur de Tonty, behold the man who abused the
hospitality of my house, and now insults me at the door of the
Prince de Conti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty looked at her satirically. &ldquo;I think Sieur de la
Salle never abused the hospitality of any household and never
insulted a lady in his life. Madame Ranard, you have lost your
temper&mdash;why I know not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His handsome face had contempt for this brilliant and seductive
figure, and he knew La Salle had in her a dangerous foe&mdash;one
who would lose no chance to hurt him&mdash;by falsehood and every
vile act of such a woman.</p>

<p>She saw his metal hand, and she now hit him with all malice:
&ldquo;Not only is your hand metal, Henri de Tonty, your mind is
also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The insult brought a flush to Tonty's face, but he kept himself
in hand. If a man had said such a thing&mdash;but it did not
matter! She was of the most incroyable kind, and she was clever and
vicious enough to give La Salle a bad time.</p>

<p>He turned from her slowly. &ldquo;The Prince will see you now,
La Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle said, with a courteous bow, &ldquo;But ladies
first!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Ranard moved forward, but Tonty said: &ldquo;The Prince
wished to speak to the Sieur de la Salle, madame. He knew, however,
that you were here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall prefer to have the last word with the
Prince,&rdquo; she said, with irony at her lips.</p>

<p>Bowing low, La Salle entered the salon and left her alone with
Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be some time. Will you not be seated,
madame?&rdquo; He courteously offered her a chair.</p>

<p>Her urbanity had returned. She smiled and seated herself and
parted the ribbons at her throat. He could not fail to see how
taking and alluring she was. All passions in her were in good
control. She gave, she took away, with perfect measurement; her
whole figure was alert, delicate, delicious. Even now her bosom
throbbed as she looked sweetly at him. She was making a sudden and
last attempt to win his approval.</p>

<p>He understood, and a strange drooping light came into his eyes.
But all he said was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The roads are bad, madame, and the sky
threatens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no reply at once, then saw the curious look in his eyes
and she quoted viciously lines from a song of Bourgoyne:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line2">&ldquo;Eho! Eho! Eho!<br></span>
<span class="line0">The lambs are on the plains.<br></span>

<h3>Defeat</h3>

<p><strong>Never</strong> had the court at Versailles been more
given to gayety and splendor. Yet behind all was an air of drama
and grim event. Bright colors, perukes, swords, uniforms, laces,
exquisite skirts, flamboyant ribbons, orders, velvet coats
sometimes pure white, and everywhere signs of brilliance. Yet it
was all possible, for Colbert had by his great finance made France
rich, and unlike his predecessor, Cardinal Mazarin, he did not seek
riches, and yet he could have made himself immensely rich. He was a
figure as dear to France as later was Cavour to Italy, or Pitt to
England, and he and his son Seignelay stood apart from the splendid
superficial flippancy of Louis' reign. Marital felicity was derided
in France, it was the sport of the theaters, but that was only at
the capital; provincial France then, as now, was free from the
sordid disregard of marital faith. Moscow was not Russia, Paris was
not France, London was not England, Vienna was not Austria, home
was not Italy, and behind all the outer show great causes and great
minds were working, and all for the good of the land.</p>

<p>In the great Hall of Apollo stood Madame de Montespan, the
favorite of Louis, surrounded by devoted courtiers, and she was not
far from the King's throne. She was a most handsome woman, graceful
in figure and with liquid and exasperating eyes. She knew well why
these courtiers surrounded her, and she did not dislike it, for it
was a tribute to her power with the monarch. But she was not
deceived by it. She had a mind that would not stop at small
things.</p>

<p>Barbe Ranard was of her class, but on a lower range of intellect
and influence and poise. Even as a model to an artist takes on the
air and imbibes the principles of art, so does the favorite of a
great monarch grow more interesting because of her experience.</p>

<p>Madame de Montespan, the mother of seven children by Louis,
seemed in excellent spirits, and was all smiles to those who
flattered her, and she was as popular with the women as the men.
She had that in her favor. She looked round the wonderful hall with
pride. Here were princes, warriors, statesmen, philosophers, poets,
artists, dramatists, all in the gaudy clothes of the court and all
in the picture in sympathy with the magnificent architecture and
decoration. She had worked her way brilliantly to her high place,
yet she was not so vain as to believe that she might not be
supplanted some day, and there was Fontanges, and there had been
Valli&egrave;re and others&mdash;and her mind was alert to hold
Louis fast.</p>

<p>As she looked down the huge rooms, she saw approaching
Abb&eacute; Potin, her confessor and secret-service agent. There
was an ominous look in his face. She did not give her hand as he
came near, but her suitors saw she wished to speak alone with him,
and they draw aside.</p>

<p>She looked him in the eyes. &ldquo;Well, Abb&eacute;, what is
it? There's trouble. Is it grave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A satirical look crossed his face. &ldquo;To have our plans
thwarted is grave even in small things. This is not the biggest
thing in the life of the Court, but it is a big thing in New
France, in which His Majesty is so concerned. It would be bad for
defeat to come now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is the matter of La Salle&mdash;that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even that, madame. The Abb&eacute; Renaudot brought La
Salle in touch with the Prince de Conti, and through him with Henri
de Tonty, and through him with La Motte de Lussi&egrave;re, and
Barbe Ranard has not been able to influence Colbert or Seignelay or
Prince de Conti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is naught, but you, have you also failed? Tell me
all, Abb&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I induced Abb&eacute; Renaudot, an astute and able man,
to get information from the Comtesse Frontenac for Colbert, and he
got what was required. But we could not win him to us. He is no
friend of the Jesuits; he is a Recollet, if he is aught, and he
made close friends with La Salle, whom he met at the home of
Comtesse Frontenac. That we did not foresee. He has visited La
Salle in his quarters, and La Salle has made progress. Yesterday La
Salle and Tonty met Barbe Ranard at the house of Prince Conti, and
Seignelay, would have naught to do with her action against La
Salle&mdash;influenced perhaps by Conti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Montespan frowned. &ldquo;Conti&mdash;Conti&mdash;he is
pestilent! Louis' son-in-law!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has weight, and has become a friend of La Salle. It is
said by the servant of Conti who is in my pay, that Barbe Ranard
failed to influence either the Prince or Seignelay, though she
tried hard. She is handsome, captivating, and clever, and could
influence men&mdash;and has influenced many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the friend of Duchesneau, the Intendant, in
Quebec. She must have brains as well as charm. I would like to see
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is here, madame. She shall be brought, if you so
wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She inclined her head. &ldquo;Is that all you have to
tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no, madame. Much more. There has been a meeting of
Colbert, Seignelay, and the Grand Monarch. Colbert, insensible to
my influence and to Barbe Ranard, has found much in La Salle to
commend, and La Salle wrote a strikingly attractive report to the
Minister of all that he has done and proposes to do. It has
influenced the powerful and successful Colbert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too powerful and too successful, Abb&eacute;, but it
would be madness to try to move him, for the King gives him high
place in affection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cannot be removed, for he is the financial bulwark of
France&mdash;an able man whom we detest, but he is
incorruptible&mdash;as I know well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No blandishment of woman could move him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not tried, madame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with meaning in her eyes. &ldquo;I have and
failed, but I shall try again, for there is much against me. It
will be worth while testing my power. La Salle's report seems to
have influenced them all. Ah, there Colbert is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the distance Colbert could be seen, with Seignelay, coming
slowly up the hall, and he was not surrounded, for few sought his
company; he was too austere. But Seignelay had a more adaptable
personality. He was a man not so great as his father, but he could
not be purchased by gold or the Magdalene, and that was rare at
Court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Majesty will soon be here&mdash;his Ministers have
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is Barbe Ranard,&rdquo; said the Abb&eacute;.
He sighed. &ldquo;I have known her some years. She is a faithful
friend of the Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Summon her to me, Abb&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; did not go himself, but sent a young officer of
the King's Guard for her, and she came gracefully forward, her step
light, her manner with an assumed modesty, her eyes tremulous with
mock humility. She was becomingly dressed, her taking neck and
fascinating face showing to advantage. She was no rival in beauty
and distinction to De Montespan, and her pretended modesty pleased
the favorite, though she saw through it; but seeing through it did
not perturb her. The deceit was a tribute to herself, and she held
out a hand in response to Barbe's curtsey. Barbe kissed it, and De
Montespan said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to old France, dear madame. You have
lived in the wild places&mdash;how long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long enough to make me glad to feel the air of old France
around me, madame. New France is not the same, though we have a
small court there and we have a life that stirs in us the spirit of
progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the Intendant, M. Duchesneau, says,&rdquo; she
replied, with her eyes fixed on Barbe's face, &ldquo;and Count
Frontenac says it even more vigorously, I hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe felt the thrust concerning Duchesneau, but she did not
resent it, as why should she in a court like this, and before the
favorite of the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count Frontenac has many foes in Canada,&rdquo; said
Barbe. &ldquo;I am addressing one of them now, am I not? It is a
contest between the Governor and the Intendant and you are with the
Intendant. Between ourselves, I do not blame you, for I too am a
Jesuit. I know all you have tried to do, and you have
failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe's face showed disconcerting changes of expression, but she
looked respectfully at De Montespan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will the great Madame la Marquise, perhaps, try
now?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Montespan's face smiled inscrutably. &ldquo;To try with so much
against one is not easy. Your own failure and that of Abb&eacute;
Potin is the best proof. Who am I that I should try? If they would
not listen to you, do you guess they would heed me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said this to flatter and also to tempt Barbe, for it would
try her skill at reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they will not listen to madame, then no one need
essay. For madame has gifts beyond all others&mdash;man or
woman&mdash;in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was pleased. &ldquo;Why not in all the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only know France,&rdquo; was the adroit reply,
&ldquo;and France is all the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well said, well said, vain patriot,&rdquo; declared De
Montespan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame, His Majesty,&rdquo; said the Abb&eacute; Potin,
drawing near.</p>

<p>Slowly, yet with portentous dignity and magnificence, Louis came
slowly up the room, preceded by his lords-in-waiting and his aides,
and all the vast audience bowed low as the little man with his high
red-heeled shoes came up the room.</p>

<p>As he advanced he spoke to Louvois, his Minister of War, to
Madame de Longueville and the Duchess Chevreuse, the most skillful
and persistent intrigantes of the time, and Mazarin had said of the
former that she was equal to ten provinces. But she had no weight
with Louis. He also gave a word to Madame de Rambouillet, the owner
of a great salon where many came, and to La Rochefoucauld, the
Duchess de Chantillon; to the poets Racine and Moli&egrave;re; to
Lalli, the composer, and Quinault, who wrote with him&mdash;and
Louis spoke as warmly to them as to the more highly titled. Near
his throne he saw mademoiselle the Duchess de Montpensier, who was
his cousin and who lived at the Luxembourg, where she received in
as picturesque a state as did no one else in Louis' empire. He had
banished her more than once, but in the end he always pardoned her,
though he never forgave her for having ordered attack upon his own
soldiers at the Bastille. With her were Madame de Scudery, who gave
famous Saturdays; the Abb&eacute; de Choisy, Madame de Lafayette,
Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;. Nearer still to the throne stood
the Dauphin, fat, over-dressed, handsome, brainless, and a danger
to France, so lacking in kingly qualities was he. Not far from him
stood Bossuet, his old tutor, whom Louis made Bishop of Metz, and
also the Duc d'Enghien, son of the great Cond&eacute;.</p>

<p>He had pride in picking out the &ldquo;Untitled
nobles&rdquo;&mdash;like Moli&egrave;re and Lalli&mdash;as he
called them, to receive recognition. It was not all vanity, for he
was a man with artistic leanings and vast ambitious purposes, and
he had faith that in good time he would, like Alexander, command
the world. Littleness was in him, but also greatness, and his
littleness was his age, and his greatness was for all time.</p>

<p>As he neared his throne he inclined his head to De Montespan and
she came to him. He gave her his hand and she kissed it, and other
courtiers drew near, and among them were the Abb&eacute; Potin,
whom he did not wholly like, though he was De Montespan's
confessor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, eyes of heaven, what have you to say. I see there
is something,&rdquo; he said to De Montespan with a railing kind of
tenderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About New France, Sire. I would speak of that. Things go
not well there, as you have told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so it vexes my sweetheart. And have only I, then,
told you?&rdquo; he asked, his eyes turning to the Abb&eacute;
Potin and then to Barbe Ranard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am concerned only with what you tell me,
Sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have decided about New France. M. Colbert,&rdquo;
he said, in a voice raised a little, and the courtiers made way for
Colbert. &ldquo;Colbert, concerning New France, there is only one
grave question there, and it is that of the Sieur de la Salle. I
have decided, have I not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colbert inclined his head. Montespan turned to Louis, and in a
soft voice said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To give De la Salle no encouragement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Louis smiled and gently replied: &ldquo;What is
encouragement? Is it the right to build forts and to find the way
to the mouth of the Mississippi, to carry on trade with the
Indians, and solely at his own cost? If that is encouragement, then
I shall encourage La Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Sire, you have never approved of settlements in the
West&mdash;it removed your subjects too far from your own control.
You refused one, Louis Joliet, an explorer, to found a trading
station in the Mississippi Valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may not a king change his mind? La Salle has the true
thing in him, and I trust him. Frontenac supports him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Duchesneau, the Intendant, and the Church and the
principal people of Quebec distrust him, bear him no good will.
Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Louis frowned. &ldquo;Yes, I know that
&lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; and it is in our presence now. It is not far
from me. But no woman save one ever traduced La Salle. Quote not
&lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; for she does not influence me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor do I, Sire, any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King pretended not to hear. &ldquo;Colbert,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is the Sieur de la Salle here to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, I think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis made a motion of his hand.</p>

<p>Officers of the King went searching, while De Montespan made
effort to turn Louis' mind, but he did not listen gravely to her,
and gently smiled and said: &ldquo;If you had the facts as I know
them, my dulciana, you would not be so vexed. You are too much of a
Jesuit. The Church shall not control my Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment La Salle, with Tonty behind him, came forward,
and all the court observed him. He was a figure men would turn to
see, having looked once. It was not alone his handsomeness, for men
like Tonty were handsomer. It was the upright precision and
physical grace of his person; it was the honesty in his face, his
masculinity of form, his indomitable look, his apparent
haughtiness, his clear energy, his concentrated look of
inspiration, as though he had no thought but one, and that was his
mission in life. As he came forward not only Colbert and Louis so
appraised him, but he was such a contrast to the Court in the
simplicity of his dress and the quiet nobility of his bearing, that
all felt him to be a tower of courage and faith against whom danger
and hardship would beat in vain.</p>

<p>The apparent haughtiness of his manner was understood by all. It
was the self-reliance of a man that lived alone, the spirit
overpowering what came before it. Never a wincing courtier, he
would have foes always, but at King Louis' court he had made
friends of four wise men&mdash;King Louis, Colbert, Seignelay, and
Conti.</p>

<p>As he bowed to the King with profound respect, for he felt the
august majesty of the scene, he won many hearts present, and even
De Montespan was moved, for she had never seen him before, and she
felt him a man who would do no mean thing&mdash;would never have
done what Barbe Ranard had said! Women know men well&mdash;such
women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sieur de la Salle,&rdquo; said Louis, &ldquo;we welcome
you. It is our first sight of you, but we know your work and what
you would do. This France of ours has vast designs&mdash;not only
European; they include America and beyond&mdash;far beyond. We will
be all-powerful, all-controlling, and we are giving you large
powers of exploration and settlement in the sure hope that we shall
not be dismayed. We would have you find the way to Mexico from Fort
Frontenac, and you shall build forts as it seems good to you at
your own cost, and you shall have sole right to trade in buffalo
hides. That is our reply to your appeal, and may God be with you
and strengthen you, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle.&rdquo; His
hand was raised in kindly feeling.</p>

<p>Across La Salle's face there passed a swift emotion and his eyes
grew dim. He was receiving far more than he had asked and it was
given him in the most public manner and with all display and honor.
When Louis ceased speaking, the attendant courtiers said in loud
whispers: &ldquo;How noble! How great! How like Jove! How dear to
France!&rdquo; All present seemed to bend in flattery save the
Abb&eacute; Potin and a few of his Jesuit brothers, and De
Montespan&mdash;yet even they put on airs of devotion to the Grand
Monarch and hid the bitterness in their souls.</p>

<p>As for De Montespan, she looked at Barbe and was almost startled
by the fierce fire of her eyes and the tragedy of her figure. She
had failed in what she had come from Quebec to do, and her wild
spirit was breaking loose upon this court, yet not to other eyes
than those of De Montespan, who had a gift of seeing. She also had
failed, and had suffered an affront which would trouble her vain,
proud heart. Not far away stood Prince de Conti, and the quiet
triumph in his eyes was like a stripe upon the raw flesh. He was a
strong, loyal, able man, and, though Louis did not love him, he had
pride that Conti was of his, own blood and family.</p>

<p>La Salle replied to King Louis briefly, and all present were
impressed by the calm, piercing emotion of his tone. He had a voice
with few inflections; it was rather monotonous, but that gave it
power, and it moved even the blas&eacute; circle of courtiers in
the great hall. It was like the man himself, direct, incisive,
convincing, enduring, and he stood a reproach to the phantasmagoria
of life of which they were. It was all poppyland, and he the wide
wastes, the dark forests, the barren plains, the evil citizens of
the Indian world, ready to burn and destroy and never
rebuild&mdash;treacherous, brave yet cowardly, insolent yet
amenable. Yet this Court had seen and should see again Jesuits who
had been tortured and burned till their hands and limbs were like
grotesque imitations of humanity. This King Louis had seen the
broken relics of men who had escaped from the farthest regions
where the fleur-de-lis waved, and yet returned to face it all
again. A Court like this, outwardly insecure, had the elements of
right, as was later shown when France, torn by revolution, would
send to the guillotine just such people as these, and they would
face their tragic end with a smile of disdain.</p>

<p>The flippancy and evil of the court were only the clothes.
Beneath it all was the kind of truth that was in Cartier,
Champlain, Frontenac, Maissoneuve, Marquette, Brebeuf Jogues and La
Salle. Tear away the laces, the velvets, the wigs and the outer
fripperies, and, stark, brave, true human life would prove that
France at her worst was better than the surface showed. This court
was a magnificent contradiction. Evil, yet good.</p>

<p>La Salle said: &ldquo;Sire, I am honored by your commission. I
have one thought, and shall ever have but one&mdash;the increase of
the greatness of your realm. Naught shall divert me from that
purpose. I have seen&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes looked through Louis and
far beyond&mdash;&ldquo;the ways open to an overseas empire that
shall be a home for millions of my fellow-countrymen, and for
France a new garden where all things shall flourish. You give me
hope that my life may prove evidence of your noble purposes and,
labors, and imperishable patriotism. I shall be ever Your Majesty's
most faithful and devoted servant, Sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During these words the little, efficient, skilful, and powerful
monarch looked at La Salle and round his Court with the air of the
maker of the world. His ears were tuned to flattery, but in the
words of La Salle was a new note&mdash;it gave his soul a spring of
virtue and purpose, it lifted him to the height of his tallest
grenadier morally. He smiled and gave him a hand to kiss, and when
La Salle rose he met the eyes of Barbe Ranard, who would have
killed him now if she could, for he saw the savage hatred in her
eyes, though her lips were smiling.</p>

<p>In his heart was triumph but his nature was free from guile or
the smaller things. He knew he was now on a new and wider pathway
of life and that behind him was&mdash;for the moment&mdash;the
greatest monarch of the world, and a
Minister&mdash;Colbert&mdash;who had even greater things in him
than his master. Colbert was then in an age and at a Court where
the small and the great were in sharp contrast, in hideous, yet
beautiful amalgamation.</p>

<p>King Louis saw Prince Conti near, and inclined his head, and
Conti came. Louis said: &ldquo;My cousin, you have an eye&mdash;you
see far. Is it done well to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Conti's face showed no feeling. &ldquo;Your Majesty is right
to-day, as he always is. In the Sieur de la Salle is a subject who
will bring honor to France&mdash;to you. I have no tongue for
flattery, Sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it well,&rdquo; and Louis lightly dusted some
powder from a scarf and gazed round him kindly. He saw La Salle
talking to Tonty. &ldquo;Ah, that Henri de Tonty, the Italian, is
he a friend of La Salle, my cousin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought them together, and Tonty goes to Canada with La
Salle. He is a strong, brave man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad. I have honored La Salle before my court. He
knows all it means to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not his speech assure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never heard such a speech at Court and I have
heard many. There is something in his voice that gets to the core
of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis turned to De Montespan. &ldquo;Well, my seraph, what think
you of La Salle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Montespan, who had the true sense of things behind her
fripperies and sordidness, said: &ldquo;My sovereign was benign,
and La Salle is a man of men. He has not the Church behind him, but
he is the soul of, the new life&mdash;over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis was pleased now. He did not see the falsehood in the
woman, for he was fond of her as yet, and he thought that
he&mdash;not La Salle&mdash;had conquered her. He whispered in her
ear, and what he said brought a slight flush to her face. Her eyes
looked into his and dropped so that their light was for him
only.</p>

<p>Barbe Ranard and Abb&eacute; Potin watched them. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Salle has beaten us Abb&eacute;, but he has not yet
left Paris for New France. There is still that to do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; touched her arm. &ldquo;Not <i>that</i>. It must
not be. He must return to Quebec, and then! Not here. Louis would
search it out after to-night. Let be. It is not the way to fly in
the face of Fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clenched her hands. &ldquo;The face of Fate shall be with me
yet, then.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter IX</h3>

<h3>Foes Meet</h3>

<p><strong>La Salle</strong> found his reception at Court had done
great things for him, but he needed money. Through the Abb&eacute;
Renaudot and Henri de Tonty he came to Simmonet, a notary, and
Raoul, an advocate, and one Dumont, who between them lent him
thirty-four thousand francs, and his cousin Fran&ccedil;ois Plet, a
merchant, lent him a large sum at the stiff rate of forty per cent.
His chief helpers were his family, his brothers who gave all they
could at last, and before his discoveries were ended he had cost
them, so they said in their extravagant memorial to King Louis,
five hundred thousand francs. And on his return even Frontenac
found a loan secured by a mortgage on Fort Frontenac.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Renaudot had proved a stalwart friend by tongue
and pen, and did his best to prevent Bellinzani, director of trade,
who had been trained by Cardinal Mazarin, from extorting money from
La Salle, but did not succeed. He thought it well, as did La Salle
and Tonty, not to appeal to Colbert or Seignelay lest worst might
chance in the end, but the money the director got was later
reclaimed by the Abb&eacute; when Bellinzani fell into disgrace
with Seignelay.</p>

<p>One day before La Salle sailed from Rochelle he was summoned to
the home of the Comtesse Frontenac, where she lived with
Mademoiselle Outrelaise&mdash;and the two were known in France and
Canada as &ldquo;The Divines,&rdquo; so popular and courted were
they. Outrelaise was not present at this visit. The Comtesse was in
high spirits, and gave him warm commendation for having triumphed
at Court and she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done great service to my husband, for your
success has strengthened him against intrigues. He cannot well meet
all the charges made, and I stay here to help him, for I have no
love for the primitive life, and yet I never go to Court. I am too
poor for that life but I will not live in the dark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame la Comtesse could never live in the dark,&rdquo;
said La Salle. &ldquo;Her life is too bright and Les Divines are
more powerful than if they were at court. I have named a river
&lsquo;Les Divines.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This pleased the Comtesse. &ldquo;You will be surprised to hear
that Madame Ranard is coming to-day and that is one reason why I
asked you. I know what she has done and still tries to do against
you, but you will conquer in the end, though she represents the
Jesuits&mdash;but herself before all and most of all! I know madame
is a foe of my Frontenac, too, but I shall see her here and find
what real stuff she is. She has some power through Duchesneau, the
Intendant, but that is insufficient. Frontenac&mdash;and you will
win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled. &ldquo;I shall be pleased to see madame again.
She is vastly able, but she did not have power against the friends
of Count Frontenac&mdash;Prince de Conti, Colbert, Seignelay, and
King Louis himself, though she had Madame de Montespan behind
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment a servant announced Madame Ranard, and she
entered with aplomb. She could never be nonplused, and not even now
when she saw La Salle near Comtesse Frontenac. After Madame
Frontenac had greeted her with cordiality and had motioned her to a
chair, she turned to La Salle, who bowed low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sieur de la Salle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;last time
I saw you, you were in close touch with the Grand Monarch. You were
in high favor&mdash;for the moment&mdash;but prince's favors are
like spring showers. They do not much enrich the ground. Is it not
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled. &ldquo;I am new to Court life and I am glad to
have the moment's favors. Better these than naught. The favors of
King Louis have their uses, and in Canada their perfect potential
uses, as Madame Ranard knows. When they cease, those who lived by
them cease. It is a place of mixed interests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A salad&mdash;a French salad, which the oil of the Grand
Monarch's favor makes good for all,&rdquo; said Madame Ranard,
lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the acid of intrigue makes bad for all,&rdquo; said
the Comtesse Frontenac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the oil endures to the good of all,&rdquo; said La
Salle.</p>

<p>Madame Ranard smiled subtly and her tongue was soft. &ldquo;The
good of all is not found without some contest of mixed interests.
The Sieur de la Salle has far to go in the wild West and much to
do&mdash;at his own expense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was that in her tone which La Salle and the Comtesse did
not miss. &ldquo;Nothing can be got for nothing in this
world,&rdquo; said La Salle. &ldquo;The expense may be high, but I
can meet it and outlast it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this he met the eyes of Barbe, which had a veiled but
bitter malice, and yet she waved a hand cheerfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prophet&mdash;prophet! God save the prophet! May he
outlast his prophecy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time in his life La Salle was the sinister
courtier. He leaned over, took Barbe's fingers and kissed them, as
they turned cold at his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Madame Ranard, you have given me the great hope. May
it be fulfilled!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was too much. She withdrew her hand sharply and looked him
fiercely in the eyes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your experience at Court has given you grace of words,
Sieur de la Salle, but there is no grace of heart behind. Your path
will be steep&mdash;and hideous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, as you said, with God's help I shall win,
madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Comtesse interposed: &ldquo;Madame sees that Sieur de la
Salle has the true spirit of the pioneer. With Frontenac's help he
will win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Madame Ranard rose and turned on her with savage irony.
&ldquo;You brought me here to meet this man, Comtesse. Know then
that I understand. I go back to Canada with the spirit you have
shown me here. You brought me here to shame me; in Canada I will
bring shame to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wrong, madame. I brought you not to shame you,
but in the hope that you and the Sieur de la Salle might find peace
here in the house of the Governor of Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace&mdash;peace, to talk of peace between us! He used
me vilely in Quebec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame, that has no glint of truth,&rdquo; said La
Salle.</p>

<p>Without a word, but with a sweeping curtesy to Madame Frontenac,
she turned brusquely with an acrid laugh, and left the room.</p>

<p>The Comtesse raised her hand in disdain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad she came, rude as she was, for now I understand
her. She is able and beautiful and bad. She will stop at
naught!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been stopped. She will start again. I go back to
Count Frontenac with a strong heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Comtesse looked at him sadly: &ldquo;Strength is good, but
love is better, Sieur de la Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle inclined his head and smiled as he looked into the
distance:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a wonderful Canadian chanson, madame: The
sentimentalists sing it there. It is popular&mdash;and
forceful!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Il ya longtemps que je
t'aime,<br></span> <span class="line0">Jamais je ne
t'oublierai.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The Comtesse turned away sadly.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter X</h3>

<h3>Lya</h3>

<p><strong>Tuke Darois</strong> had found employment in the offices
of the Farmer of the King's revenue. He had been in the employ of
the Hudson's Bay Company. He spoke the French language perfectly
and came as a spy on the doings of La Salle and the <i>coureurs de
bois</i>, who were rivals in trade with the Hudson's Bay Company in
the far West and North. With his combined origin, Darois was a
capable man and had no morals. He had a good-looking and
enterprising face, he was bearded, was about medium height, and had
an attractive personality. He did not say he had been with the
Hudson's Bay Company, but had been a trapper in the North, and he
was welcomed to Quebec by officials of the Province, for he had the
rare ability to write and keep accounts, and his services were
welcome in the department of Rojet Ranard.</p>

<p>His daughter, Lya, with brown hair, brown eyes, rather a large
mouth exquisitely shaped, and a broad, low, fine forehead, lived
with him. Her hands were capable and fine and she had a long firm
grip. From her hand you would judge her character. It told so much.
She had been commanded not to say they had been with the Hudson's
Bay Company; and this was to prevent prejudice against her father.
She had no mother&mdash;her mother had died at giving her birth,
and she had living with her an old black-eyed, lame Frenchwoman
called Luce Hontard, who was devoted to her. She was one who might
go far in the world, if aught could be judged by outer form.</p>

<p>One day after La Salle and Tonty had arrived from France with La
Motte de Lussi&egrave;re, they were coming from the citadel where
Frontenac had received them with cordiality, and La Salle saw Lya
walking towards her father's office. She had so much spirit, yet
was so modest, so simply yet becomingly dressed, with none of the
hair-dressings and flounces of other girls of the city, and with a
resolution of her slight figure at variance with her vivacious
face. Somehow she arrested La Salle's attention. He had never been
impressionable, and no woman ever had a hold on him. He drew
Tonty's attention to her. Tonty was also attracted and was unable
to say why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A newcomer and a beauty. Who?&rdquo; said Tonty.</p>

<p>La Salle shook his head in negation. They saw her enter her
father's office.</p>

<p>Tonty spoke. &ldquo;Ah, Tuke Darois's daughter, no doubt! That
is his office. I met him this morning. He is watching the
<i>coureurs de bois</i>, of whom Du Lhut is chief. How do I know? I
don't. It is only instinct, but I'm right, for I saw signs of it in
his office. He does not ring true. He's got a twist somewhere. I
saw on his table a manuscript marked <i>Du Lhut</i>. So, I made up
my mind. He is working against the <i>coureurs de bois</i> and Du
Lhut. But not his beautiful daughter&mdash;no, if that is she! She
is as straight as the sun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle nodded and gave a short, hasty laugh. &ldquo;Perhaps
you are right. Let us go to his office. I have some business with
him. It concerns the accounts of Fort Frontenac. He is a man to
know. We start for the West in two days, my friend. See! There is
Rojet Ranard coming towards us. How cheerful&mdash;as though he had
not a care in the world. But he is Mephistopheles&mdash;as black as
a pan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty nodded, and M. Ranard came towards them, smiling. He knew
Tonty and had not seen him yet, as he had been in the West.</p>

<p>He raised a hand in greeting. &ldquo;Ah, M. Tonty, I welcome you
to Quebec. You would do much here, I know, and you have left much
behind you.&rdquo; He held out a hand and Tonty took it with a
bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I greet you well, M. Ranard, and. I left behind naught I
could not afford to leave. I work with my friend Sieur de la
Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M. Ranard turned slowly to La Salle. &ldquo;Sieur de la Salle
and I are old friends, and we meet as always&mdash;in good
feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle looked coldly at him. &ldquo;It is as M. Ranard says,
we meet in the feeling we had when I left for France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am told you met my wife there, Sieur de la
Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had that felicity, monsieur&mdash;at the home of
Comtesse de Frontenac, and before that at the palace of the Prince
de Conti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was charmed by your success&mdash;you were received
by the Grand Monarch at Versailles and were given your commission
before the court. It was a triumph for you, Sieur de la
Salle.&rdquo; There was veiled sarcasm in Ranard's tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a triumph for New France, let us say,&rdquo;
remarked Tonty. &ldquo;It had the soul of exploration and
trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had the soul of Sieur de la Salle,&rdquo; said Ranard,
with a biting tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his is the soul of New France,&rdquo; said Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May it flourish for the good of old France!&rdquo;
returned Ranard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If all here say Yea, who shall say Nay?&rdquo; said La
Salle, ironically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all say Yea,&rdquo; sneered Ranard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then things have changed since I went to France,&rdquo;
said La Salle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else could happen. Your absence is a vast
event,&rdquo; remarked Ranard maliciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Especially when Madame Ranard was gone also, bent upon
the good of Canada, and helpful to me in France!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dark light came into Ranard's eyes. &ldquo;She will always
help you in the same way, as you well know, Sieur de la Salle. She
never changes, and if you but visited our house again, you would
flourish more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have flourished because I did not remain in your house,
monsieur, and I hope I shall never enter it again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet we shall meet often in this small place, Quebec, and
we cannot escape each other's influence, can we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is made plain by the difference between the Governor
and the Intendant, and yet we know our influence on the
Intendant,&rdquo; said Tonty.</p>

<p>The eyes of Ranard grew sullen, for he felt what Tonty would
convey, but with a sneer he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Duchesneau is not like you or me&mdash;or he
would take return for your insolence, M. Tonty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laid his hand angrily upon his sword, and Tonty shrugged a
shoulder. &ldquo;I was not insolent to the Intendant,
monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were insolent to me&mdash;then draw, monsieur, and
see which can uphold his honor best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cold light blazed in Tonty's eyes. &ldquo;I do not care to
fight you, monsieur, but you have ways I do not like. I would find
what is inside you&mdash;blood or ditch water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They at once began to fight, and had made but a few strokes, in
which Tonty was at an advantage, when Bishop Laval came upon them
on his way from the Church council. He was, as always, plainly
dressed, and his striking face with long nose and piercing eyes
gave him a singular personality. He had been master of New France
in other days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Messieurs, messieurs,&rdquo; the bishop said, in
amazement, &ldquo;what do you broiling in the street! Is Canada to
be governed thus! Stop fighting, messieurs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He insulted the Intendant,&rdquo; said Ranard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not insult the Intendant, Monsieur de Quebec. I
said what monsieur thought reflected on the Intendant, but it was
not meant so. I came with Sieur de la Salle from France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bishop turned towards La Salle and smiled in a frigid way.
&ldquo;The Sieur de la Salle has a high place in the heart of
Canada, M. Tonty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out his hand, this spare, almost emaciated bishop, but
there was power in his whole bearing and authority in all he said.
He lived a life of abject poverty, had been a Jesuit in his youth,
and had brought to Canada two things&mdash;self-effacement
physically, and the ever-present love of his Church&mdash;its
advancement. He had no love for La Salle, for he would extend
immigration in the West, and that he and the Church did not wish.
His Church had once been all-powerful, and received four-fifths of
the revenue sent by the King, but of late years that power had
declined, and the old man resented it in so far as his nature
could. The Bishop had done much for Canada, and his thin lips now
drew tighter as he turned to M. Ranard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not seemly, M. Ranard, that you should act
so&mdash;an officer of the Government; yet maybe your temper took
umbrage where none was meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first Tonty would say that umbrage was meant to Ranard, but
he abstained; and all seemed settled, for the two men put up their
swords, but La Salle said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Tonty took up the quarrel on his own part, but the
difference of opinion was with me, monseigneur, and I would gladly
have fought with M. Ranard, for a reason which he and you will
understand. I do not forget what happened in his house and what was
said at the Saint Famille. These things should not be handed over
to one's friends. M. Tonty said what I would have said with more
point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bishop's face flushed slightly at the mention of Saint
Famille, for he knew what had been said there, and he had given
this society of Jesuit ladies his approval; but he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sieur de la Salle, we have no knowledge of your
difference with M. Ranard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his wife,&rdquo; interrupted La Salle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his wife; but this is a small place and we should
live in peace. There have been misunderstandings, no doubt, but we
should overcome our feelings for the sake of unity in this pioneer
land. Why should we not all be friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Ranard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will say, why not, then!&rdquo; said La Salle.
&ldquo;The greatest Governor Canada ever had is opposed by good men
like Le Moyne and his sons, and Le Ber and La Chesnaye; Damours, De
Villeray and De Lotbini&egrave;re, and many others, and they are
all against me because I open new territory and advance new trade
in furs. I know what forces are against me, and what intrigue goes
to hurt good things, but the good will prevail, monseigneur. I will
help advance that, but I will yield naught in all I do to open up
the West and South.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held himself modestly, firmly erect, for this was the first
time he had opened his mind to the Bishop, and he wished it to be
plain what sort of man he was and what he meant to do. Bishop Laval
liked La Salle&mdash;he knew him as one who never spared himself
and fought with clean hands. But his ambitions clashed with those
of the Church and the Intendant, and that was against him
sorely.</p>

<p>He said, quietly: &ldquo;Your designs have support from all who
care for Canada, but your methods are not those we all approve. Our
ways are not your ways, and we work by different rules.
Yet&rdquo;&mdash;he raised his hand in benediction, and the men
dropped to their knees&mdash;&ldquo;I give you blessing in your
work, for I know your heart is full of high purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they all stood up, Ranard said: &ldquo;Monsieur de Quebec, I
shall wipe this dark thing from my mind. I will be a friend to
Sieur de la Salle. I offer him my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle instantly said: &ldquo;I have no faith in the
friendship of M. Ranard. I cannot take his hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bishop looked at him sternly for a moment, then his face
cleared and he said, &ldquo;At least the Sieur de la Salle is an
honest man,&rdquo; and he turned and went towards his palace.</p>

<p><i>Habitants</i> and rivermen and a few <i>coureurs de bois</i>
and a burgher or two had gathered, but they came not among them,
and though they wondered what the quarrel and the consultation
were, they were too much in awe of Bishop Laval to come too near.
Quebec was too often roused by combats to be astonished.</p>

<p>Ranard looked at La Salle with grim irony. &ldquo;You have
refused my hand; be sure you can justify that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ready to sustain it,&rdquo; answered La Salle, with
bitter coolness, for this man and his wife were the limit of
endurance&mdash;so clever, so corrupt, so bad, and yet outwardly so
fair.</p>

<p>Lifting his hand in courtesy La Salle moved away with Tonty,
while Ranard stood for a moment in furtive mood, and then walked on
with malign purpose.</p>

<p>As they passed along the street there came to their ears a song
of the pioneers of France, brought to Canada by the
Carignan-Salli&egrave;res Regiment. It floated out on the clear air
with sweet melody and happy resonance:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;I am a very good
knife-grinder,<br></span> <span class="line0">I am a very good
knife-grinder,<br></span> <span class="line0">And for my daughter I
have great fear&mdash;<br></span> <span class="line0">And in the
islands I have a great fear<br></span> <span class="line6">When I
am there,<br></span> <span class="line0">As she is very
good.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;If I go on the sea,<br></span>
<span class="line0">If I go on the sea,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">It will be never to return,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">And, in the islands I have a great fear,<br></span>
<span class="line6">When I am there,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">For she is very good.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>As they listened, Tonty laughed: &ldquo;He may be a good
knife-grinder but I doubt it, and for his daughter, he may well
have a great fear, for she <i>is</i> good! That's so, isn't
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle nodded. &ldquo;He's bad enough, I doubt not, and she's
good, I doubt not, and we shall see them both soon. Here we are at
his door.&rdquo; La Salle flow said to Tonty: &ldquo;We are on the
bank of a turbulent river, but we shall cross it safely. Our
heaviest trials are before us. Naught borne in the past can equal
what I must bear&mdash;what we must bear&mdash;in the future. As I
open this door, I open a new and horrible chapter of life. This I
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened the door and Father Louis Hennepin stepped out.
Hennepin was clothed in a coarse gray capote and peaked hood, with
sandaled feet, a crucifix at his side, and a cord of St. Francis at
his waist. From a convent at Artois he had gone to Calais at the
herring-fishing season, had made friends of sailors and become
enamored of foreign lands. After many requests there came
permission to go to Canada, and he sailed in the same ship as La
Salle, and scolded a party of girls who were enjoying themselves
with officers and passengers on deck. La Salle had told him he was
acting like a pedagogue, and Hennepin retorted that La Salle had
once been a pedagogue in a Jesuit school! This La Salle resented,
for his foes were now Jesuits and he wished not to be linked with
them. Besides, he pierced the hollowness of Hennepin's
character.</p>

<p>Hennepin had a quick, cheerful spirit, and his enthusiasm,
physical health, and stature were great. Now when he saw La Salle,
he bowed and smiled, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am deeply glad to see you, Sieur de la Salle. I would
join you in your explorations. If I had permission from my
superior&mdash; Ah, may I not go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle had mind to see all sides of a question, and, while he
had not faith in him, Hennepin was not a Jesuit. After studying the
friar briefly, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get you permission, and you must start at once. We
shall meet at Fort Frontenac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hennepin raised hands in joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give me great news, and I will serve you to my life's
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was clear Hennepin wished to stand well with him, and that
was much in Canada where so many were against him. La Salle
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be ready to start to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an exclaimed blessing Hennepin paced away, bold and hardy
and daring, but as fake a friar as ever wore the gray capote, who
would grossly exaggerate, a conscious but contented liar.</p>

<p>As Hennepin walked away, Tonty said: &ldquo;Are you sure of that
man, La Salle? What is he doing here with Darois?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is strong, he has a vivid mind, and he will succeed
with the Indians, and we need that. He is a Recollet, and not a
Jesuit. Who knows what he has been doing here? One is sure of
this&mdash;he is not deliberately my foe! That is not in his mind
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time they were inside the office of Darois. He was
standing with back to them, talking to a clerk in a silky voice
with ragged edges. At last, the clerk disappearing, he swung slowly
on La Salle and Tonty, and looking at them softly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I welcome Sieur de la Salle and M. de Tonty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle bowed: &ldquo;I have come upon business, Monsieur
Darois&mdash;the accounts of Fort Frontenac. They are not
complicated, and they are few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darois bowed, and his bearded face showed no apparent feeling,
yet his eyes had a furtive look which did not escape Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you sit down, messieurs?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>In Tonty's mind was the thought about the girl, Lya Darois. She
was not here, but she had evidently gone into another
room&mdash;that into which the clerk had entered. Tonty liked the
face and figure of the girl. It did not seem possible she was the
daughter of this smooth and subtle man who was now examining
accounts of La Salle. It is clear he had a mind of business
capacity, and a tongue that did its work well, but he was sure he
was a spy on the <i>coureurs de bois</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>coureurs de bois</i> were indocile, debauched, wearing
the sword and decked out with lace. They would not cultivate the
soil, swaggered like lords, spent all their gains in dress and
revelry, and despised the peasants. Yet they were a wonderful body
of men, brave, chivalrous, carrying all before them when properly
led, and expert traders with the Indians, and that was why the
Hudson's Bay Company had sent Darois&mdash;he did not yet know that
Darois had been sent to spy upon La Salle as well. But he disliked
Darois' face as he bent over the papers with La Salle.</p>

<p>Lya Darois, that unusual and reliant girl, that pure product of
the northern plains&mdash;where was she? Tonty wished to know.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XI</h3>

<h3>La Salle Receives a Loan</h3>

<p><strong>The</strong> Abb&eacute; Jean Cavelier was La Salle's
eldest brother, a priest of St. Sulpice who had gone to Canada
before La Salle, and he proved of far less caliber than the great
explorer. He impeded rather than assisted La Salle by his small
character and his interfering ways. He was in Quebec, though he
lived at Montreal, and La Salle want to see him before starting for
the West. The Abb&eacute;'s thin, almost cadaverous face was in
sharp contrast to that of La Salle&mdash;strong, vigorous,
immobile, handsome, full of character. In his quarters at the small
Seminary of St. Sulpice he awaited La Salle, and when he came,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come from Montreal to welcome you. You did well in
France, brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle shook hands warmly and received the Abb&eacute;'s
blessing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have Fort Frontenac, and the rights to build forts and
to find the mouth of the Mississippi, and have been raised to the
nobility. All this was given me at Versailles by King Louis and
with my foes at work. Even De Montespan with a Jesuit confessor was
against me, and Madame Ranard was there&mdash;acting for
Duchesneau, but Louis is his own adviser, and he and Colbert and
Seignelay were with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; chuckled, for he was a courtier and he loved
success. He could not condone effort with failure. His soul was
small. La Salle recalled how, when it was reported that he was
living at Fort Frontenac&mdash;this lie was spread by his
foes&mdash;with a girl he had seduced, the Abb&eacute; had gone out
in great indignation and had found him at the head of an exemplary
household with two Recollet friars in attendance and had come back
to Montreal a wiser man. The Abb&eacute; had borne the hard journey
well, for he was a healthy man, and as a St. Sulpice priest he
could save money, which he did; but he helped his brother
little.</p>

<p>His thin hand fluttered over La Salle's head in blessing, and
seemed full of piety, but this had little effect upon La Salle, who
knew the Abb&eacute; had not come to help him. If his journey to
France had been a failure, he would have been cold and
unsympathetic. La Salle wished to keep a friendly attitude, for it
would go ill if in the minds of the public, dissonance were known
between him and his brother.</p>

<p>Presently the Abb&eacute; said: &ldquo;Have you enough funds for
your work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not funds enough. Our cousin, Fran&ccedil;ois
Plet, loaned me money at forty per cent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forty per cent&mdash;avaricious cousin!&rdquo; said the
Abb&eacute;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More came from other sources in France, and Count
Frontenac has raised some by mortgage on Fort Frontenac. The
Governor is my friend and I have a few others I can trust So I can
go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some money&mdash;not much, but I can loan you
twenty thousand at half the interest of Fran&ccedil;ois
Plet&mdash;his is excessive&mdash;and you will pay me back in good
time, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle at once said: &ldquo;I will take the twenty thousand
gladly, and at twenty per cent interest, which is better than
Fran&ccedil;ois Plet, but it came from one who does not know Canada
and before I received my commission from King Louis at
court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; rubbed his hands together, for he was an
avaricious man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have the twenty thousand to-morrow&mdash;no,
now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to a drawer and counted out the money, then sat at a
table and drafted the note-of-hand at twenty per cent.</p>

<p>As he wrote the explorer watched him. La Salle knew him to be
without human sympathy&mdash;a time-server, a courtier, a priestly
follower of the Church, because it was part of his attitude towards
life. He had started fair&mdash;honestly, so far as was in him, a
priest. Then he had fallen from his original honesty and was now of
the false life of France transplanted to Quebec. He would sacrifice
anyone for gold, even his own brother.</p>

<p>La Salle's spirit revolted, but yet they were of the same
father, had lived in the same house, drawn milk from the same
breast, had the same country and the same God!</p>

<p>At last the Abb&eacute; stood up. &ldquo;You have many foes, but
in me you have a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave La Salle the money and La Salle took it and sat down at
a table to sign the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One true friend is worth ten foes!&rdquo; said La Salle,
with grim softness, and he smiled at his brother, who did not
realize the satire.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XII</h3>

<h3>The Man, Nicolas Perrot</h3>

<p><strong>At</strong> Fort Frontenac La Salle entered upon a new
and interesting phase. He had De Tonty with him and La Motte de
Lussi&egrave;re and Father Hennepin, and soon after his arrival
there came to him Nicolas Perrot, called Jolycoeur, who had been
employed by the Jesuits and was an explorer of courage and skill.
La Salle welcomed Perrot warmly, and did not know that he now
worked for Barbe Ranard, so had the beauty of the woman acted upon
the impressionable nature of the brave explorer.</p>

<p>La Salle had a servant, Nika, a Shawanoe hunter, ever with him,
and from the first this acute native suspected Perrot, though he
could not tell why. Yet he kept watch.</p>

<p>Time was spent in improving the fort and attracting Indians.
Trade in fur steadily grew, while La Salle planned to build the
first vessel that ever sailed the western Lakes, the
<i>Griffon</i>, at Niagara.</p>

<p>La Salle liked Perrot, but could not understand why there shot
into his mind at times a doubt&mdash;yet the man worked hard and
had influence with the natives. One day Nika, La Salle's servant,
was absent, and La Salle and Perrot had a meal together. Before the
dinner Perrot mixed a salad and La Salle ate it, but three hours
later was seized with convulsions. He had no suspicion of poison,
yet it was one of the most frequent crimes in all Europe.</p>

<p>In the night he called and Perrot came to his bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ill&mdash;most ill,&rdquo; said La Salle.
&ldquo;Give me an emetic. It may do me good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot mixed an emetic with no joy, for it might save La Salle's
life, and he was thinking only of Barbe Ranard. La Salle took the
emetic, yet it seemed not to cure him, for in the morning he was
again seized by convulsions, and would have died had it not been
for Nika, who, returning, at once guessed the truth and gave La
Salle a drink of Indian herbs. He found what La Salle had eaten the
night before, and discovered a few leaves of the salad, saw they
were discolored, and wrapped them in paper and kept them. At last
Tonty returned, and Nika told him what he feared. Tonty, who had
some medical knowledge, analyzed the leaves and found in them
hemlock and verdegris.</p>

<p>Perrot was kept away from La Salle's bed. He seemed now morose,
now cheerful, and both kept strict watch of him and fought for La
Salle's life. At last La Salle was out of danger, and then Tonty
acted. He told La Salle of his analysis, and La Salle was
convinced. He had studied medicine first in France, and afterwards
with a doctor in Quebec for the good of his explorations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should he wish to kill me?&rdquo; asked La Salle.
&ldquo;He is able, well known, himself an explorer. It is
incredible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is working for the Jesuits,&rdquo; said Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. They would not go so far with me,&rdquo; said La
Salle. &ldquo;I will accuse Perrot. He made the salad&mdash;the
cook cannot make one; and I trust my cook. He has been with me five
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will speak to Perrot first, and I will do it
carefully,&rdquo; said Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said La Salle, now thin, worn and
feeble.</p>

<p>In another room Tonty, smoking a pipe, said to Perrot:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a curious illness of Sieur de la Salle. I think
he has been foully treated. I was not here when he was seized. You
were. What were the symptoms, Perrot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot told him briefly, a startled look in his eyes, for he
knew Tonty to be an able man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks like poison,&rdquo; said Tonty, looking
steadily into the gray eyes of Perrot, his own black ones subtly
shining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cook&mdash;I can hardly think it,&rdquo; said
Perrot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did he cook all the meal&mdash;all?&rdquo; said
Tonty, fastening the now shifting eyes of Jolycoeur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He prepared the dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you have?&rdquo; asked Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fish from the lake, a black squirrel, some potatoes grown
here, and a raisin pudding. Naught else, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But yes&mdash;a salat, m'sieu',&rdquo; said Nika,
standing near. &ldquo;I saw the leafs, and the cook he can no make
a salat&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made the salad,&rdquo; said Tonty, with sudden anger,
and he clenched the table with one hand and stared into the
fluttering eyes of Perrot.</p>

<p>Perrot suddenly seized a knife at his belt, but Tonty's pistol
was in his face. &ldquo;None of that, Nicolas Perrot. Come and say
to La Salle what you've said to us. Come&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot saw no chance of resistance. A glance at the eyes of
Nika, who hated him, hastened his footsteps to La Salle's
bedside.</p>

<p>La Salle looked at him without speaking, then at last he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard what passed. You have had my hospitality&mdash;we
have worked&mdash;fought together&mdash;had the same trade of
exploration. Why did you poison me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot at once lied. &ldquo;The Jesuits hate you. One will do
much for one's church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle frowned. He was at first inclined to believe Perrot,
then his mind revolted. He could not think the Jesuits would do
that. Cold-blooded murder, and the tool a well-known explorer like
Jolycoeur, seemed beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>Nika put it right: &ldquo;That man, he lie&mdash;it is no
Jesuits&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle looked at Nika. Nika had instincts, and these were
all-important. Nika's instinct was poison, and poison it had been.
Right once by instinct, why not right twice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not the Jesuits, Perrot. Who was it? Answer, man!
Who was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have naught to say,&rdquo; said Perrot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it the Jesuits? Answer me,&rdquo; said La Salle.
&ldquo;You have but a short time to live, so tell the truth. Do not
enter your grave with a lie on your lips. Was it the
Jesuits?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; said Perrot, sullenly, for he was in
their power.</p>

<p>La Salle's forehead cleared. He was glad, for, foes as the
Jesuits were, they had done vast service for the country and for
France; and murder like this had seemed too shameless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then who was it&mdash;your own evil heart,
Jolycoeur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no hate of Sieur de la Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Tonty spoke. &ldquo;We believe you. Then it was a
woman&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot did not answer, but his head hung low and despair was in
his body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Madame Ranard,&rdquo; said Tonty; but before he
said this he motioned Nika out of the room.
&ldquo;She&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot inclined his head. He had lost all he had hoped to win by
La Salle's death, and his mind was sullen.</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes flared. That woman still pursued him and was the
agent of so much that had been done against him. She was still
active, and she had brains and skill, and her soul was like the pit
of Avernus. What should he do? The right thing was to have Perrot
shot at once as a would-be murderer, or sent to Quebec to be tried,
but in that case notoriety would ensue and the end would be
bad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have him disarmed, Tonty, and kept a prisoner, and come
to me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot, conscious of Tonty's and Nika's arms, yielded up at once
his knife and pistol, and soon afterwards was in a small room by
himself, unbound, but guarded by Nika, who had fastened the
door.</p>

<p>Tonty returned to La Salle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do, La Salle?&rdquo; asked Tonty, with
anger on his cheek. To think that La Salle, the man who was to do
so much for Canada and France in this hemisphere, should have been
so near death! As La Salle lay feeble, but with so stern a face and
so resolute a look, Tonty almost wept, for in this explorer he
found that new thing&mdash;an absolutely honest man, with no fear
and with high faith.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence La Salle said: &ldquo;I shall pardon
him, Tonty. He has been sent mad by that woman, and in his heart he
does not hate me. He would have killed me for her sake, but so
would many a man have done. Perrot is not a bad man&mdash;he is
simply a mad-man, and I shall set him free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty protested. This shocked him. &ldquo;It is most unwise, La
Salle. He will be your foe in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearness to death makes the brain clear and the spirit
understand; besides, Perrot is a fine explorer and he will do good
work. I shall free him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty sat with bowed head for a moment, and when he raised it
again his eyes were smiling. He grasped one of La Salle's
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my soul I know you are right, La Salle. Shall I bring
Perrot to you? Is that it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At once, Tonty&mdash;he must not remain here under guard.
Bring him, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments Perrot was again in La Salle's room. He held
himself erect, for his manhood had reasserted itself and he was
ready for all that might come. He came to La Salle's bedside and La
Salle said, &ldquo;Sit down, Perrot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot sat. La Salle looked at him a moment sternly, yet sadly,
and said: &ldquo;I am glad you did not succeed, Perrot, not only
for my own life's sake, but for that I wish to do for our beloved
land. I am of no account, but Canada is and France is. For a wicked
moment you forgot both. But you are a man who can do great work for
your land, and I implore you to do it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot looked up astonished. Was he then to live? His eyes
became blurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go from here with no stain on your character,
so far as the world is concerned. It was not your real self that
attempted my life, but a woman who would injure me and who had no
regard for you. Did you think she would turn to you when you had
killed me? You were in her power and you could do naught; you would
have been a murderer. Did you not know that? She is the friend of
the Intendant. Do you not see how she inveigled you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot's face underwent many changes, but the last expression
was one of sullenness. Suddenly he shivered with fury. He had been
made a tool and would have killed this man. And for what? For a
sordid passion which made him slay his own soul for a woman's body,
for the rage of the flesh which had twisted his life to do a brutal
deed.</p>

<p>La Salle felt the thoughts passing through Perrot's mind and his
great spirit spoke. He saw how distraught Perrot's face was, and he
knew the man truly repented of his dastardly act. He was not all
bad&mdash;he had had a fit of elemental lunacy, and he now saw
himself as he really was&mdash;the victim of an evil force which
would have sacrificed him in the end. And how easy! To make him the
victim of public disapproval, of her husband's sword or the
Intendant's power, and she to go through it all unmoved save in her
vanity, with smiling face. That was what vexed him now, which made
him see himself in the light of this man's face whom he had tried
to kill. He saw her now in her graceful, luxurious gown, her pale
face and dark, fascinating eyes, her slight yet sumptuous figure,
her ravishing power over the lower side of man.</p>

<p>Suddenly he dropped on his knees and his head bowed in shame.
With a broken voice he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sieur, I have naught to say. My eyes are open. May God
forgive me for the evil I have done you and myself! I am the
scum&mdash;the dregs&mdash;I, Nicolas Perrot, once an honest man,
now the dung of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His body shook. But La Salle touched his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still, Perrot. I shall soon be at work again, and you
shall work for your native land. I cannot employ you. Your evil
deed would be ever before your eyes. But be my friend in the world
where I need friends. Speak of me as you know me, a man who is the
lover of his land and his King. Speak me fair,
Perrot&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot rose to his feet. His eyes shone, his face lighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spare my life! You spare my life! You are of the
greatest of the world, and I will help you when I can. My tongue
will always speak for you. I go not to Quebec, for I should do some
mad thing to that woman, but into the northern fields. May I go
now, Sieur de la Salle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A smile seldom came to La Salle's face, but one came now and he
said, gently, &ldquo;Go in peace, Jolycoeur&mdash;and may God be
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Perrot stood looking at him with strange
intentness; then he stretched out a hand as if in good-by, and,
turning, left the room, meeting Tonty at the door.</p>

<p>Tonty knew what La Salle had done, and his eyes gazed sternly at
Perrot, for it was too bad that he should go free. But to arrest
him or have him shot was not good, for it would be evil for La
Salle in the end. Yes, La Salle was right, so Tonty made way for
Perrot to pass, with the words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adieu, Perrot! May the path you tread be
clean!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrot looked him firmly in the eyes. &ldquo;<i>Merci</i>, M.
Tonty. It shall not be a bog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he passed out of the fort, Nika's eyes watched him with
anger, for he was of a race that never forgave, and he could not
grasp La Salle's action. Yet he fought the thought of having Perrot
captured by Indians and tortured, for that would be unfair to La
Salle, whom he loved. But he followed Perrot to the door, gave him
his arms, and said, with eyes glowering:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good luck to you&mdash;no. Good to torture you, but
for Sieur's sake, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he was gone Nika stood still looking at the door. Unmoved
he stood for five minutes, brooding, his mind alive with evil
thoughts. He saw Perrot tied to a tree, and his tribe peeling bits
of skin from his body and burning it and eating it. He saw little
stabs in every part of his body and live coals thrust in the wounds
made. He saw the white body grow red and purple and a mass of
gashes, and a face contorted with pain. He heard a voice in
horrible agony, and then Tonty's voice behind him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Nika. It is all over. He is gone. Go in to your
master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nika drew himself together and slowly, heavily, he went to La
Salle's room with a look at Tonty which had in it the primitive
faith that would know no change. He was true.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XIII</h3>

<h3>Lya Makes a Discovery</h3>

<p><strong>Lya Darois</strong> was fitting her life to that of the
capital. Sometimes she went to her father's office, but she kept
much to herself, though young ladies sought her company. She was
more plainly dressed than they, and she wore no glittering bodkins
or aigrettes. The hair of the young ladies of Quebec was always
curled and powdered. Those of high rank got up at seven, dressed
till nine, drinking coffee at the same time, then they placed
themselves at a window and, in a dirty jacket and a coarse
petticoat not reaching to the middle of the legs, they took up some
needlework and kept their eyes on the street. They were lazy, but
on the whole they had good manners, wit, and delicacy, and good
voices, and a great fondness for dancing. When they undertook to
catch a lover he could not easily escape.</p>

<p>Lya had little to do with them. She lived with her father and
old Luce Hontard, and she had not yet been to the court of
Frontenac. But one day Frontenac saw her with her father and she
was invited to his next reception. Frontenac, a good judge of
character, distrusting Darois, for there was a look in his face he
did not like, had confidence in the daughter, and felt her to be
honest, true, and very intelligent, though so young&mdash;only
eighteen.</p>

<p>So, simply yet prettily dressed, Lya went to Frontenac's
reception, and was cordially received. The lady who acted hostess
was the wife of Count Louvigny on Frontenac's staff, a relative of
the Governor, and she at once liked the young girl, but presently
Lya was left to herself and she stood not far from the Intendant
and Madame Ranard. With rare gift of hearing the words of Madame
Ranard came to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That leper, La Salle, escaped Nicolas Perrot, who did his
work ill. Now this must follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then begged Duchesneau to incite La Salle's creditors to
seize his properties at Quebec, and put men in his employ who would
desert and leave him too few to meet the demands of his
title-deeds.</p>

<p>Duchesneau said: &ldquo;With the help of Tuke Darois we will
destroy him. Darois is our man. Why he hates La Salle I know not,
care not, but he can do our will. He watches Du Lhut there and does
not hate Du Lhut, as who could, but he watches and hates La
Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This startled Lya, as she had not known her father's especial
task, but if it was to watch La Salle and Du Lhut and be foes to
them both, then he was a spy&mdash;a spy&mdash;her father a spy! It
made her sick in mind, for such a life was detestable and low. A
spy! her father a spy! She shuddered slightly, but she listened
sharply still.</p>

<p>Madame Ranard's eyes glinted wickedly. &ldquo;His
daughter&mdash;I'll make up to her. There's more in her than in her
father. I'll find what she knows. That Nicolas Perrot, it sickens
me! He, an explorer too, and to fail! He has not come to Quebec
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe went slowly to Lya, unaware that all between them had been
heard. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear mademoiselle, I am glad to meet
you&mdash;very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya curtsied. &ldquo;I do not know your name, madame, but that
does not matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe looked alertly at her, but felt no intended insult in the
words. She was, however, piqued, for that anyone should not know
Madame Ranard seemed too ignorant&mdash;in so small a place as
Quebec! She hid her irritation and smoothly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Madame Ranard and my husband is Farmer to the King's
Revenue. Your father works for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya showed mock surprise. &ldquo;Ah yes, I have heard of you,
madame. You belong to that wonderful society, the Sainte
Famille.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe looked at her rather suspiciously now, but before she
could reply Madame Louvigny came and said to Lya:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not hear Monsieur Du Lhut talk? He is of the
interesting men in Canada. He has done great service for the
King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe slightly sneered. &ldquo;He is a <i>coureur de bois</i>
who breaks the laws of the King. His reputation is
known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the laws are broken, His Excellency, the Governor, is
responsible for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So said Madam Louvigny with point, for she knew the dark nature
of this radiant woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Excellency, I have been told, is responsible for
trade with the English at Albany, Madame Louvigny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Louvigny shrugged her shoulder slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Ranard has listened too intently to the gossip of
the Intendant's office. It has been written to France by the
Intendant we know, but we kill that in this salon, madame. It does
not last, that sort of falsehood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then turning to Lya she said: &ldquo;Come and hear Du Lhut, my
dear. The King is proud of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Darois is a faithful listener to Monsieur Du
Lhut, madame. So his daughter should listen also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in her words wrung Lya's spirit, but she smiled at
Madame Louvigny and said: &ldquo;I would like to hear monsieur. His
face is well known. He leads men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Ranard's eyes had smothered fires as she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He leads the <i>coureurs de bois</i>, who break the laws
of trade in fur that the King has made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Louvigny smiled serenely at Barbe and led Lya away from
the malicious foe of La Salle. Barbe watched them until they drew
near to Du Lhut, then she returned to the Intendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They fight, but we shall win in the end,
Jacques.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so easy winning here. What did they
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Ranard told him, and the Intendant frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl has brains. She is not all on the surface. I
wonder does she know what her father is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sure she does not,&rdquo; answered Barbe. &ldquo;She
is demure and ignorant, but clever in her way. She has a mind of
her own&mdash;that's plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presenting Lya to Du Lhut&mdash;to her father's
disgust&mdash;madame presently left the powerful Du Lhut talking
with respect and vivacity to Lya. He was won by her winsome
honesty, and others listened with envy, for he talked directly to
her.</p>

<p>Madame Louvigny went to Frontenac and told him quietly what
Madame Ranard had said, and Frontenac showed naught in his face,
knowing that the Intendant and Madame Ranard were watching, but he
nodded sedately and smiled, as though listening to pleasant things.
Then he turned to Louvigny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sedition is spoken here, Louvigny. The Intendant says I
am trading through Du Lhut with the English and Dutch at Albany.
What fools! Do they think they can defeat Louis
Frontenac?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A frown showed on his forehead, a sneer touched his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I so small, think you, my Louvigny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sparrow fights the eagle, Excellency. We know which
will win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louvigny smiled, for he knew the Intendant's eyes were on him,
while Frontenac's back was towards them.</p>

<p>Frontenac laughed now. &ldquo;Due care should be had when the
crows are flying low, Louvigny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crows and the vultures, Monseigneur,&rdquo; said
Louvigny, smiling grimly, for he was thinking of the Intendant and
Madame Ranard and the Jesuits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may all work together, Louvigny, but when I move
they must give way. Here Bishop Laval comes. Now for frontier
diplomacy&mdash;and the eagle's claw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Frontenac met Bishop Laval with friendly courtesy.
The Bishop was a big man in reputation and character&mdash;one of
the biggest Quebec had known. As he came to Frontenac, his ugly
nose seemed larger than usual, but his eyes were glowing, his
figure thin, yet slightly stooped, and one hand fingered gently the
crucifix on his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am proud to greet you here, Monsieur de Quebec. You
give distinction to my poor court,&rdquo; said Frontenac, with
courtesy.</p>

<p>He looked on the assembly where were penniless and improvident
nobles like the Marquis de la Sablonni&egrave;re and numerous,
black-robed Jesuits, Recollets in gray robes, beautiful women from
the Court of France. Also men who had left France broken in fortune
and were living here as officials or adventurers, officers of the
Carignan-Salli&egrave;res Regiment, who had received seignories,
gentlemen of Canada like the Le Moyne family, Le Ber, Chesnaye, Du
Villiers, Lotbini&egrave;res, Robillards, Martinoyes, Caron,
Sechets, Benjoinville, Lauriers, and others all in laces and
velvets and swords, all eager to serve their own interest. Many of
them were foes of Frontenac, who, as they thought, stole from them,
by support of La Salle, their share of the fur trade. Among them
were <i>coureur de bois</i>, who were welcome at Frontenac's court,
and who, many of them, were little removed from peasants, while
some were nobly born like Du Lhut, and lived lives of adventure and
profit and would fight with <i>&eacute;lan</i> and success at any
time. They were the figures in the life of Quebec, bold, strident,
conquering. Frontenac eyed the throng with no emotion except that
which said: &ldquo;Of these I am the master, and none shall defeat
me. I know my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not a scene like that at the Palais Royal at Versailles
or Fontainebleu, for there was none of the glittering architecture
of those places, no vast tapestries and paintings and sculpture, no
lofty ceilings, yet it had distant view like Versailles. It was
however a court with brilliant charm, for the dresses of all were
showy and were a gallant foreground for the dark timbers of the
ceilings and the brown wood of the walls, along which there showed
a few good pictures of France and the ancient spears and flags of
armies of kings that lived before Louis XIV. It was a large room,
and it looked important. It had a glamour of its own.</p>

<p>Laval quietly said, in a smooth and careful voice: &ldquo;Your
court does no dishonor to Versailles, though it is smaller, but
here there are fewer shreds of humanity. We are a people with good
things in us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to hear you say so, Monseigneur, for sometimes I
have doubted it, yet you should know better than anyone else.
Perhaps my office makes me too exacting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your office has been filled by none more distinguished
than Count Frontenac. I have seen many come and go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That says much, for some Governors were of your own
choosing. You honor me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been moments when I doubted Your Excellency
was the best fitted for the post, but I have faith now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His keen eyes shone. He was evidently anxious to get something
from Frontenac. He continued: &ldquo;Even a bishop can make
mistakes in a land where mistakes are common. We have crossed
swords, Your Excellency, but I found you most competent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac felt some purpose in these compliments, but he could
say naught to help the matter on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never crossed swords with a bishop in my life, but
if our wills are meant&mdash;yes. I found Monsieur de Quebec no
amateur in mind and purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bishop smiled. Presently he said, softly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to know if you approve the purposes of Sieur de la
Salle. He would extend discovery and the King's rule on this
continent and develop settlement largely. Is that good? Is life to
be lived with gold and silver as the end of all? Are not the souls
of men more? We Churchmen wish to convert the Indians and to save
their souls for God, but we seek not money. To us it is better to
make the Indians true sons of the Church than to use them for gain,
as do the new settlers La Salle takes to the West. Is that not
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac looked with a grave smile at the Bishop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand. The Church had been the true servant
of exploration and trade. I do not forget the martyrs who have
given their lives, like Brebeuf and Lalemant and Jogues and so many
others. And they were traders, too. Even Marquette, whose late
discovery of the Mississippi with Joliet would develop territory,
and with it trade. The greatest Intendant ever here, Talon, who
increased trade and showed the way to manufacture of many things,
knew that this land could not always be the foster-child of King
Louis. It would pay its way, and only by trade can it do so. Eyen
the house the present Intendant lives in was a brewery built by
Talon, and you have schools for children which he started. Your
Church has ever been the friend of exploration and trade, but now
you wish the Indians only to be sons of the Church!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bishop's face hardened as he listened to the Governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had first in our minds the salvation of the
Indians, and that could only be by exploration. We have been
friends of trade, but it is not our chief aim. The soul&mdash;the
soul of the Indian, that is first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, frankly, Monsieur de Quebec, your missions only
prove that you can give the world great martyrs. There you are
supreme. To be sons of the Church only is not the policy of King
Louis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was until lately,&rdquo; was the rather tart reply of
Laval. &ldquo;Your Excellency changed it. He would not let Joliet
build forts on the Illinois and the Mississippi. La Salle would not
have received these wide powers save through Your Excellency's
intervention. Your Excellency has great influence at
Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac smiled. &ldquo;Monseigneur, I had no influence. He
himself did all, save for the letter I gave him, to Colbert. But
others had written to Colbert&mdash;the Intendant and his friends
here. No, La Salle himself carved his own way in France. He had
against him&mdash;so the Comtesse Frontenac wrote me&mdash;the
constant efforts of Madame Ranard&rdquo;&mdash;the Bishop
stiffened&mdash;&ldquo;who was acting indirectly for the Intendant.
La Salle convinced them all, and before the whole Court King Louis
gave him his commission. But La Salle did it in spite of De
Montespan and her Jesuit confessor, and the Intendant, I chance to
know, and not through me. I have good correspondents in France, and
my wife is on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have always lamented she is not here, Your
Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot say all, my lord Bishop. She has no love of
frontier life. She is not strong. It is better to have in France
some one wholly loyal to me, and so she stays there. Her use to me
in France has been shown again and again. She does not go to Court,
but she is a perfect chronicler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say she has the golden key to the Court, though she
does not enter it. You will not try to influence La Salle against
his present course&mdash;is that your will, Excellency?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac said, firmly: &ldquo;I have helped La Salle in every
way possible. I borrowed money for him. To all he does I give
assent, for he is an honest man, and that cannot be said of many in
New France&mdash;as I have found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bishop had good self-control. He showed no feeling, but he
said: &ldquo;I regret to oppose you in this policy, Your
Excellency. You may find it successful, but I doubt it&mdash;ah, I
really doubt it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Bishop doubts, the Governor must take
heed!&rdquo; said Frontenac, with quiet point, and then they moved
away from the crowd, the Intendant and Madame Ranard watching
intently.</p>

<p>From the side of Du Lhut, Lya at length detached herself. She
felt him a man of rare ability and she liked him; and upon this man
her own father was a spy, and upon a far greater man, La Salle.</p>

<p>She went to her father. &ldquo;I would go home,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>Darois saw a shadow in her eyes and he thought it fatigue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come then. We will have a quiet walk in the bright night.
I have had enough of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside he said, &ldquo;You found Monsieur De Lhut
interesting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the most interesting men in Canada, don't you
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To me one of the most interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darois smiled grimly as he said it.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XIV</h3>

<h3>The Cross-Roads</h3>

<p><strong>News</strong> of La Salle and Tonty came but slowly to
Quebec city, and meanwhile life went on. Du Lhut vanished with his
<i>coureurs de bois</i>. Not very many of these were nobly born
like Du Lhut, and some of the best men of the colony pleaded with
Duchesneau to obey the King's orders and suppress them.</p>

<p>It was an old source of trouble between Frontenac and the
Intendant, and letters had gone to France in protest from the
latter and in defiance from the former. King Louis and Colbert
believed in Frontenac, but they both reproved him and they both
chided Duchesneau. The difference was that Frontenac would develop
the King's estate regardless of himself, but to do so he must evade
the commands of the King in this one respect, while Jacques
Duchesneau was only, and always, for himself, with no high
patriotism, and with intent to grow rich.</p>

<p>Word had come that La Salle was building a ship which was to go
over the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi, and the ship was to
be called the <i>Griffon</i> in honor of the coat of arms of
Frontenac, and against the purposes of the Jesuits. Yet La Salle
had got from Louis the right to build forts and to open up trade on
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Here it was Tuke Darois did his work. He was intent to destroy
Du Lhut and ten times more eager to ruin La Salle, for increase of
trade meant injury to the Hudson's Bay Company, and he was their
spy in the service of Duchesneau. His enmity to Du Lhut and La
Salle had the support of the Jesuits and the Intendant and Ranard,
who did not know that he was a spy of the Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

<p>Darois at last determined to go to Fort Frontenac and to try and
spoil the purposes of La Salle in two ways&mdash;by letting the
<i>Griffon</i> be built at considerable cost, and then giving her a
pilot who would sink her, and by weaning from La Salle his workers
and so place him in difficulty with Louis and Colbert, who has
demanded that he keep so many men at his fort. La Salle had
borrowed money in France and in Canada and to ruin him financially
would be the last great blow.</p>

<p>He did not tell his daughter where he was going when he started.
She thought it was only to Montreal and Three Rivers, for he was
astute. He did not know she had an inkling of his real position,
and he hid the truth from her. Lya visited but little, yet she had
many invitations, for the notice taken of her at the Ch&acirc;teau
by Frontenac and Madame Louvigny and Du Lhut had its influence. It
was only by chance that Lya found her father's true purpose, for
one day, coming past the Bishop's palace, she met Madame Ranard,
who stopped and spoke to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear mademoiselle, you are alone, I hear.&rdquo; She
smiled sweetly, but Lya was not to be deceived by that. She smiled
also, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not alone, dear madame. Our old servant is with me,
and I have much to keep me busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But busy&mdash;for so long alone!&rdquo; said Madame
Ranard, raising her eyebrows.</p>

<p>At once Lya seized some hidden meaning in the words &ldquo;so
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;What is a few weeks in a lifetime,
madame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few weeks&mdash;but no, a few months, my
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, even a few months&mdash;what of that? I did not
know my father would stay so long in Montreal.&rdquo; Her eyes
caught those of Madame Ranard with a hidden suspicion, for she
recalled that night at the Ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>Madame Ranard now struck with venom, but softly and subtly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Montreal is naught&mdash;weeks&mdash;but your father goes
far beyond that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya shrugged a shoulder. &ldquo;Does my father, then, confide
his plans to madame?&rdquo; she asked in irony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is under my husband in office, and I know where he
goes, and why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Ranard smiled. She was convinced that Lya did not know
her father's purposes or where he was going. So it was she had
struck so deftly. She wished Lya to be hurt, for she felt the girl
against her.</p>

<p>Lya's face showed naught of what she felt, but her tongue
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>why</i> may I ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Ranard thought hard. What difference could it make if she
told that which would irritate the girl, who loved her father,
would not expose him to Frontenac or seek to remove him from his
post. Lya was in a quandary, and it did Ranard's dark spirit good
to think she was stabbing this slim, lonely girl through her gentle
bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you shall know, if you do not. He goes to bring La
Salle to his senses and to do true service for King
Louis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean he goes to ruin La Salle?&rdquo; asked Lya,
intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father does his duty&mdash;as do all who love France
and the King more than themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Governor is La Salle's friend and believes in
him!&rdquo; said the girl, with slightly heightened color&mdash;she
wished to show she had been struck hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frontenac&mdash;oh, he&mdash;yes, he is La Salle's
friend, but Frontenac's days are numbered here, as are La Salle's.
Do you think that Frontenac and La Salle can fight the Church and
the Bishop and the great traders forever? Why, no, my child, that
can't be done, and the biggest man in this country is the
Intendant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had calculated her stroke well. The girl would not go to
Frontenac and tell him what she, Madame Ranard, had said, for she
loved her father, and if she told Frontenac anything, she must tell
all, and that she would not do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, madame, if what you say is true, I am sorry we came
here, that is all. Oh, why did you tell me? I must fight it all out
by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, not that. There's always the Church. You can
unburden your heart to a priest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No priest can help me. For months&mdash;for months!
Madame, you have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped as though her feelings had overcome her. They had
walked far, and she was now near her own home. She had fully
deceived Madame Ranard, who left her with a furtive look and with
the certainty that the girl's lips were sealed.</p>

<p>When she had gone Lya's face lost its affected misery and her
eyes blazed up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God! does she think me made of wood? Does she think I
know not what to do? My father gone to Fort Frontenac, has he? And
to destroy La Salle! Well, there is a way for me, too. She knew
well I would not go to Frontenac. But she forgets&mdash;forgets I
have courage and endurance. I am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said no more, but quickly reached her home.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XV</h3>

<h3>The Argonauts</h3>

<p><strong>It was</strong> late Autumn and in the East snow had not
yet begun to fall. Lya had made her arrangements quickly and told
no one save Luce Hontard of her destination. She found two faithful
<i>habitants</i> of the Du Lhut corps, who knew the woods as they
knew their own hands. These men, who loved mystery, assented
gladly, for they meant to join Du Lhut in the West, and to them she
was like some sweet bird flying to a new nest. Lya had a gift of
inspiring confidence, given to few, and she had no fear in
travelling with these two. In her heart of hearts she knew life,
and her soul was as radiant as the drops of water hanging in the
leaves after a rain, through which the sun shines.</p>

<p>It was Luce Hontard who put her in the way of getting these good
men, both of whom were near fifty years of age, both bearded and
with eyes that showed not singular integrity, but temperament which
would honor every law that made a girl safe in the darkest places.
Both had been married and both were as widowers, though one had
lost his wife by desertion and not by death. This made him not
gloomy, but firm, and with a sense of chivalry which is and always
had been characteristic of the French Canadian. He was Jules Ladaux
and he was short, thick-set and with endurance and great skill of
the woods.</p>

<p>The other was Luc Maste, whose wife was true and faithful, and
he was built like wire, and his roving nature had a stern sense of
duty. He had wandered far, had been in danger often, had been
prisoner of the Iroquois, had even been tortured, but he had come
through all with a nature which would not stoop to the mean thing.
He had killed Indians, had been in raids for skins against the law,
had the air of a <i>petit gentilhomme</i> and was at times dressed
like other courtiers, with velvet and lace, and he did this solely
to make the <i>coureurs de bois</i> more prominent. His was the
vanity of the good men of the lower orders. He was a
<i>habitant</i>, and yet was a cut above, with a kind of natural
dignity, and it was strengthened by the gallantry and grace of the
well-born Du Lhut.</p>

<p>At their first meeting with Lya, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am told you are going West to join the great Du Lhut.
Is it so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's so, for sure;&rdquo; said Luc Maste, and Jules
Ladaux nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you to go with me farther West than you have meant
perhaps. I cannot tell you where yet. I cannot pay you high, for I
am poor, but I will give you each&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luc Maste interrupted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will serve you, m'm'selle, without bargain. We are not
hucksters&mdash;<i>nom de pipe</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes lighted and a smile came to her lips. &ldquo;Let it be
so, then. I like you to feel you are doing good to one who loves
France and Canada and all that concerns their good, as you
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your love of both would not be doubted&mdash;no!&rdquo;
said Jules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean myself. I mean one who has many foes, yet
thinks not of himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="image">[image: Jacques Duchesneau]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father?&rdquo; said Luc Maste, with a faintly
furtive eye, for he had his doubts about Tuke Darois, and this was
Tuke Darois' daughter! The instinct of the French Canadian is
always acute, and he feels where he cannot think&mdash;he feels
first. Luc caught the swift flash of her eye as she said in
reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean my father. He has many friends and he does
think much of himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jules interposed: &ldquo;It matters not. We shall go where you
will, seek whom you seek, and our mouths will be like ice in
winter. You want that, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya's breast heaved: &ldquo;It is so. You will not regret it. I
will start in twenty-four hours. Can you be ready then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They both looked at the young, slight, yet firm figure, at the
composed yet fiery face, at the self-reliant eye, and their reply
was instant: &ldquo;We can be ready&mdash;bagosh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a hand to each, and they took them in their own, and
with the other hand raised above their heads made a silent vow,
looking into her eyes the while. A glimmer of a tear showed in her
eyes, but her lips were firm, and she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one must know till we are on our way. No one must
guess where we are going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not know, m'm'selle, and we do not gossip. You can
trust us. <i>Tiens!</i> we have never been one of those who
blabbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No lady has ever taken the risks you are about to take,
m'm'selle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do my duty, that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be great dangers and we are but
three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand. I have been brought up with a gun in my
hands. When great things are at stake, risks must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment Luce Hontard entered. She was portly and slow,
but she had a body of great endurance and an unwavering mind. She
did not hesitate to let Lya go, for, though no one had said why the
journey was taken, she understood. She had an uncanny gift of
prescience. Her eyes settled on the three for a moment. She saw
that all was well. Then she looked the two men in the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, you&mdash;good, good!&rdquo; she said, and no
more.</p>

<p>Both men kissed her on the cheek. She flushed slightly, she even
smiled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me&mdash;good, good!&rdquo; she said, and no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tonnerre!</i>&mdash;but yes,&rdquo; said Luc
Maste.</p>

<p>Twenty hours later, at break of day, when the broad river was
flowing gently past Quebec, the three started in a canoe with no
watchers near&mdash;only a stray <i>habitant</i> who had no
interest in the three and gave them scarce a glance. It was no
unusual thing for man to start on journeys at dawn. The canoe was
well loaded, yet not so heavy that they could not carry it, and
all, beyond the rapids of La Chine. After those were passed there
would be no further trouble, and at La Chine they could get help,
if needed, from <i>habitants</i>.</p>

<p>As the canoe sped away quickly Lya looked back. There was the
Ch&acirc;teau of St. Louis on the heights, looking grim and stern
in the early light; there was the palace of the Intendant
Duchesneau, massive and striking and long; there was the Jesuit
College buildings in the square, with the glow of the rising sun
touching the white walls; there was the palace of the Bishop, the
cathedral, and the house of M. Rojet Ranard by itself, and in it
was the woman who had done harm to La Salle and would do more, if
she could; and there was her own small house which maybe she might
never see again. Then there were the homes of Lower Town, the
warehouses, the few shops, the places of business, the mart.</p>

<p>Lya was dressed in chamois from head to foot, her cap was Indian
with a small tail, and she looked like a priestess of the wilds.
This was an expedition which would demand all the endurance of a
stern pioneer, all the courage of La Salle himself, all the faith
of a saint. At last with a tremor, not of fear, but of excitement,
she looked ahead.</p>

<p>There was the broad river, there were the mists, and there was
the lovely shore of the river at the North; there were the sure
dangers, but the sun was breaking through the mists, and she
suddenly felt all would be well. Here and there along the shore was
a house, here and there a <i>habitant</i> at his plow or in the
field, and now and then an Indian with his bow and arrow or a gun.
All the land seemed a place of beauty and strength, and to Lya
there came visions of the future when these shores would be
inhabited and all this land a glorious empire of the King of
France.</p>

<p>At last she took a paddle as well, and worked like a man, while
the two <i>coureurs de bois</i> sang one of the songs so much
beloved in Canada:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;There is no land like this&mdash;no,
no;<br></span> <span class="line2">Fly away, my heart, fly
away!<br></span> <span class="line0">There is no hope like
this&mdash;no, no;<br></span> <span class="line2">Fly away, my
heart, fly away!<br></span> <span class="line0">Here is a bride to
kiss, yes, yes;<br></span> <span class="line2">Stay here, my heart,
oh, stay!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>Softly Lya joined in the song, and the lilt of their voice's
with the strange deep feeling of these people came out like the
song of the birds in the trees of the shore. Somehow, at the very
start of their voyage the fibre of these people of the woods and
streams was a guaranty of success. Yet Lya knew that few dangers
would come till they had passed Montreal and were far up the river
by Lake Ontario. She liked these men; they were of the right sort,
and it touched her grimly that it was they, with La Salle, her
father was set against in his work.</p>

<p>Their meals were made on the shore&mdash;game, Indian corn,
bread, prunes, baked pumpkin, and spring water and tea and coffee,
of which they had plenty, and she quickly tidied up after the
meals. When night came, after a thirty-miles' row, they camped on
the shore; and she slept in a tent, but the men on the open ground.
She slept soundly, and at dawn she went for a bathe at a secluded
spot; yet she knew that this could not continue, for, once they had
passed Montreal it would not be safe, and so Luc Maste made plain
to her when she said at breakfast that she had had a bathe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be madness in the
wilds&mdash;<i>bidemme</i>!&rdquo; said Luc, and he looked her
straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. When we pass Montreal I will not bathe in the
river. But till then, oh yes! I know how careful we must
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the woodman's sense,&rdquo; said Jules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the riverman's mind,&rdquo; said Luc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the woman's instinct,&rdquo; said Lya, and she
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And some other things also, bless the good God, or we
should not be here,&rdquo; added Luc.</p>

<p>It was after passing the rapids of La Chine, and the river
widened and grew more beautiful with the maples, elms, and oaks
deepening in exquisite color on the banks, and the air was like a
vivid wine, that the real dangers came. One night they camped on
shore, and Lya did not undress, for she felt peril near. Her sleep
was not sound, and she was suddenly waked by seeing the cloth of
her small tent raised. She softly drew her gun to her. Then the
body of a man appeared. It was an Indian, and there were two others
behind him. They were in war paint and feathers. As the Indian
stooped to enter, there was the sound of two shots, and two Indians
fell, but not him who was now inside her tent. As he half turned to
the door she fired. He fell at her feet with a sharp cry, but
raised his tomahawk to strike. She seized his arm, and with her
knife struck him in the chest, and he fell and lay still. Outside
there was further discharge of guns and wild whoops of fury, and
then sudden silence, and Lue Maste came running to her tent. He saw
the dead Indian at her feet, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They nearly caught us, the five of them, but they are all
dead. They think we were no good&mdash;eh! Jules has a very slight
wound in the leg, but we're both all right.&rdquo; They both looked
at her with grave, proud eyes. &ldquo;You are a true <i>coureur de
bois</i>, but yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point Jules appeared, and the two men carried out the
body of the Iroquois. They carried the five into the woods and left
them without burial. It was near morning and they did not lie down
again, but built a fire and waited for the dawn.</p>

<p>As they sat waiting, an anxious, drawn look came into the face
of Lya. This Indian was the first man she had ever killed. She had
seen many, many killed, and thrice had wounded Indians, but had
never killed till now. Her youth, her composed beauty, her
self-possession, were all there, and the two men worshipped
her.</p>

<p>Looking up from the fire, she at last said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have trusted me. You have followed my will. Now I
tell you where we go. It is to Fort Frontenac, where my father has
gone.&rdquo; They both nodded, and Luc Maste said, sarcastically,
yet carefully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father goes upon the finances of the Fort, and to
see that all is after the will of the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so. Yet why not trust La Salle, who is a good
friend of France? I did not know my father was going to Fort
Frontenac!&rdquo; Her eyes were searching those of the men.</p>

<p>Luc Maste laughed a little. &ldquo;Yet you go&mdash;and why? It
is a hard journey, and we are not yet there. You go not upon the
finances of Fort Frontenac. It is much danger for one so
young&mdash;and a woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya gave a low half-ironical laugh. &ldquo;Well, my father and I
are queer. We are mysteries, and why he went, and why I go, are
mysteries. Let it stand. Danger&mdash;I am used to that, and so are
you. You work for nothing, and you risk your lives for me. I will
never forget while I live. How long before we reach Fort
Frontenac?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jules Ladaux' eyes were shining. The French love mystery and
melodrama, and this adventure was meat and drink and inspiration.
&ldquo;It all depends&mdash;yes. If it freezes and we have to walk
much, it will be long. If we can go by canoe all the
way&mdash;another week. Yes, if it freezes we shall have to leave
the canoe, and we must take our chances on that&mdash;<i>sacre
bleu</i>. Then we shall be in danger always, for the Indians are
many on shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in the hands of God,&rdquo; said Lya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then God be with us,&rdquo; said Jules Ladaux, and they
both signed the cross with their fingers.</p>

<p>At last dawn broke, and the reddish glow made the river very
beautiful, and all the vast expanse a glory of wild life. It did
not seem that death and danger could be near. The roseate glow was
like a balm to a troubled world&mdash;the sun was a feast of the
eye.</p>

<p>To Luc Maste his friend said, while Lya made breakfast:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't plain why he or she should go to Fort
Frontenac.&rdquo; Luc Maste laughed low. &ldquo;It's plain to me.
Darois is the foe of La Salle and means him harm and our Du Lhut
also, and this girl goes to stop the harm, if she can. She is as
straight as her father is crooked&mdash;that's my view. I've not
seen one like her since I was born. Mystery, she says, but we know
it's no mystery. We will get her there safely, in the name of
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they were within two days of Fort Frontenac by river it
froze, and they had to take to the land. They could only carry
enough to feed them, and enough clothing for the heavy frost. The
tent for Lya had to be left behind, and much else, but this they
had known from the start, and so they turned the canoe on the few
things they abandoned, and walked on, each loaded to the limit. As
they marched, Luc ahead and Lya in the middle, the men sang softly
a chanson:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Peasant, give me your
daughter,<br></span> <span class="line2">And that is
all!<br></span> <span class="line0">Peasant give me your
daughter,<br></span> <span class="line2">And that is
all!<br></span> <span class="line0">I pray you give her to
me,<br></span> <span class="line2">You will make my heart
happy!<br></span> <span class="line0">I pray you give her to
me,<br></span> <span class="line2">You will make my heart
happy,<br></span> <span class="line0">And that is
all.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>They had no want of food, and they had hominy and brandy. They
had seen Indians now and then, and more than once they were
anxious, but they were not attacked, for the Indians were not
Iroquois, but Algonquins, and were not inimical to whites. One of
the men slept for four hours by turn, and they would not let Lya
take turn at watching. As they each got at least seven hours' sleep
a night, each morning found them vital. They had no more adventures
till they reached Fort Frontenac and saw the bastions, the narrow
gateway, and the strong walls, and round these walls tribes of
Indians La Salle had gathered there.</p>

<p>As they neared the fort of a late afternoon, Indians came to
greet them, and there was warm welcome, and Indian women made
special welcome by clapping hands on open mouths, and they gathered
round Lya excitedly, fingering her dress and admiring her. She was
the first white woman who had ever come this hard journey to Fort
Frontenac. They took what she was carrying, the Indians did the
same with Jules and Luc, and they entered the gateway of the fort
with much clamor. Inside were Indians. Some had brought furs to
exchange for goods, and bartering was at its height. It all had
color and display.</p>

<p>Now suddenly there appeared in the doorway of the fort three
white men. Two were Recollet friars, and one had the air of an
official. They did not at first see the newcomers, but presently
the hurly-burly reached them and one priest, pointing, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrivals from the East. Two men and a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two men and a woman? That's strange!&rdquo; said Tuke
Darois, and came forward. He was amazed to see his daughter, and he
turned pale. A frown came, then he hurried forward. With a
searching look at her two escorts he embraced Lya and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;God in Heaven! What brings you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her reply was firm, &ldquo;Not what brings you here,
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the two men who had come with her, Luc said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now begins the real story. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XVI</h3>

<h3>Face to Face</h3>

<p><strong>To</strong> her father Lya said, &ldquo;Why did you
come, please?&rdquo; With a scowl he replied, &ldquo;When I know
why you have come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya shook her head. &ldquo;Anyone will tell me. I know why you
came.&rdquo; Her voice was pierced and strong. &ldquo;Why did you
say you were going to Montreal only? Why did you deceive
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my own business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came close to him, her eyes flashing. &ldquo;You are a spy
and the foe of La Salle. You came to injure him. There are those
who know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was startled. An ugly look came into his face. &ldquo;Who
told you that? Who says I am a spy? If so, you are, then, the
daughter of a spy. Do you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face was flushed, her mouth bitter. &ldquo;I could kill you
for degrading yourself and me. You hid it all from me. You&mdash;a
spy! A spy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could kill me&mdash;you!&rdquo; he seized her arm.
&ldquo;Who told you I was a spy? Who? What devil lied
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one lied. That night at the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis I
heard it, and now I know it true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard it&mdash;from whom?&rdquo; There was anger, yet
a fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Madame Ranard and the Intendant. You are their agent
and they know why you are in Quebec. You spy for the Hudson's Bay
Company, but they do not know that, and you spy for them. Why do
you hate La Salle and what he does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spying is not dishonorable. Better men have done it. It
is the clash of race and interests&mdash;two vast concerns one
against the other.&rdquo; He said this roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are more English than French&mdash;is that it? You
work for French Canada as well as the Hudson's Bay Company? Does
the Intendant know that? You don't want the French to trade,
therefore you hate La Salle because he does trade. His foes don't
want him to trade, and so you spy for them on La Salle and Du Lhut.
That is it, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don't know I'm a spy of the Hudson's Bay Company.
They only know I am against La Salle and Du Lhut. It coincides,
that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are here to hurt La Salle, and I have come against
you. If you go on against La Salle, I will expose you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scorn, anger, and sorrow were in her voice. All her being
revolted at his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would tell then what I am&mdash;you, my
daughter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell them, and I will tell Count Frontenac. If he
knew, your life would be worth little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes grew big with amazement. He had a child that would send
him to his death&mdash;to oblivion&mdash;because her soul was just
and true. He had known she had ability, but this new vein was
bigger than all. She had character, and her journey out was
wonderful. No woman had ever made it, and she had done it with two
men whom it was his duty to overcome. She had gone through how much
danger and anxiety for the sake of conscience. He had to deal with
a brain better than his own, and a character to which his own was
as a distant star to the sun. Down deep in his crooked nature was
love of her. His mind was confused, his purposes seemed suddenly
dark and treacherous, his soul was awakened a little. Yet he was
bitter that she should oppose him so. He caught her arm
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go my arm,&rdquo; she said, with sudden anger.
&ldquo;I am not your slave. You shall treat me with respect, even
if you do not love me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped her arm at once. He saw that he must go warily, or it
could be ill for him, for she loved truth more than she loved
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it you would have me do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cease to spy for the Hudson's Bay Company. You are your
own foe. I will not bear your treachery. I can make my own living,
and I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he looked at her with malice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do this, you will do that, and you will give me
up to the hands of Count Frontenac. Then I will make you no
promise. I will go on as I have done. If you and I clash, then the
stronger wins, and I am the stronger.&rdquo; He added, moodily,
&ldquo;Do these who brought you know what I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waved an indignant hand. &ldquo;They know naught. They
brought me here free of charge. They risked their lives for me.
Once I was near death and they fought to protect me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told in a few words the attack by the Iroquois, and her
father's face was a study. He realized that she was one in ten
million, and that she would carry through what she meant to do. But
he must make a fight for his authority or all would be lost. He
would see it through in his own way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the fort,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we will
talk of this later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face hardened. &ldquo;Unless you promise, I will take my own
course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are not all I have in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who have you, then?&rdquo; he asked, in a surly
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you have forgotten&mdash;the truth of
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were now at the door of the fort, and they were admitted
with no formalities. The first person they saw was the astounded
Tonty. His fine, distinguished figure, his black handsome eyes, his
healthy face, his air of ease and culture, fascinated her at once
and she smiled into his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you came to see your father do his duty here,&rdquo;
he said, with outstretched hand which took her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to see my father do his duty,&rdquo; she said,
with a curious grave smile, which did not escape the quick thought
of Tonty, for he felt things more than saw them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You show no ill-effects from your long hard
journey&mdash;no lady has ever taken it! You shall rest here while
your father does his duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a delicate inflection in his voice which did not
escape the girl, and she knew it was in reply to her, but Tuke
Darois did not feel or see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall see the Sieur de la Salle at dinner&mdash;or
perhaps before,&rdquo; he said, as he showed her into a room some
distance from her father's. There with a bow he left her, and with
a pleasant nod she saw her bundle placed in her bedroom, and with a
scowl her father disappear.</p>

<p>Left alone, Lya looked round the room. It was bare, yet from the
few drawings on the wall, the narrow bed, the plain deal table and
the chairs and washstand, she had a sense of home. It was a new
feeling, and after unpacking her few things she sat on the edge of
the bed and looked at the opposite wall. It had a shelf on which
were two books, and one of these was the plays of Corneille, and
one the essays of Bossuet, and her sense of culture awoke. Culture?
What had she to do with culture? She had lived in the wilds always,
and she had read much, but never the plays of Corneille or the
essays of Bossuet. She went over, brought them back, and opened
them. In the Corneille volume the first words she saw were:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spirit is a fire, and it burns up all that
shames;&rdquo; and from Bossuet these words met her eyes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed is the soul that holds the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid the books beside her on the bed. So this was the first
message she had after her dangerous journey! She was to burn up all
that shamed, and hold to the truth. She must hold fast on the
course she had entered, and she would
warn&mdash;carefully&mdash;both Tonty and La Salle. She looked at
herself in a small mirror on the wall. Yes, hers was an honest
face, and a kind one, and in her eyes was a steady light which
would not be diminished. She sighed heavily and sat down on the bed
again. What should she do? In any case she would warn La Salle that
the Jesuits and the Intendant were out against him, and that Madame
Ranard was a constant and deadly foe, and she could do this without
implicating her father. Perhaps he knew all this; but he did not
know that her father was a spy, and she could not tell him that;
yet she would go far to save La Salle. She had made a desperate
journey, and she would go through with it. In a sense she felt
responsible, for she was the daughter of a man who was La Salle's
foe and who would go far to ruin him. Her coming would at best put
them on their guard. She was glad she had come.</p>

<p>For a half-hour she sat in meditation, then there came a firm
knock on her door. She opened it. Luc Maste and Jules Ladaux stood
there. Luc Maste smiled and he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We come to ask if all is well with m'm'selle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave each a hand. &ldquo;All is well, dear friends, and you
shall have commends from me to Sieur de la Salle. Will you go into
his service? Is that possible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They both shook heads. &ldquo;No, we go to follow the great Du
Lhut,&rdquo; said Luc Maste. &ldquo;He is not so big as La Salle,
but we cannot change our service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well roomed in the fort?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well as can be, after our outdoor nights. This is the
best fort in Canada. It is managed like a game of chess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment Tonty entered. He saw the two men and shook them
warmly by the hand. &ldquo;You good men brought mademoiselle a hard
and dangerous journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They smiled and bowed low. Luc Maste said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not work, it was honor. We were glad all came
right, even when attacked by the Iroquois!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attacked by the Iroquois!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They told him briefly what had happened. Tonty turned to Lya
with pride in his eyes. &ldquo;We are glad you are here&mdash;safe.
Now enjoy your rest, my men, and be sure La Salle will thank
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two disappeared. Then Tonty turned to Lya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Salle will see you now if you will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya lifted up her head in pride. So she was to talk with La
Salle. Her hands clenched at her side and her face turned slightly
pale, and Tonty saw both. He had had more than one love-affair in
his life, yet never had he felt what was in him now for this girl.
She had a way with her, greater than any lady he had ever known. It
was not the airs or graces of the life in Paris or in Rome, but
those of a capital city called Nature, in which she was supreme.
She was sensitive, but composed and self-possessed&mdash;she was
alive in the highest and truest sense. She had culture which comes
from pure heart and soul, the grace of perfect naturalness. He was
moved in some deep part of him, as he had been when he first saw
her in Quebec. As he walked beside her he was aware how soft and
gliding was her footstep, how lissom was her figure, how buoyant
was her carriage. She was not tall, yet she was perfectly made, and
had rare dignity. Presently they stopped before a door and Tonty
turned the handle and they entered. La Salle was seated with a map
before him on the table, but he rose and came forward.</p>

<p>Like Tonty, he had been impressed at Quebec by her appearance,
but here, shut off from the world where no ladies had ever been,
she was like a ray of sunlight in a dark place, and for the first
time in his life his soul was stirred by a woman. How wonderful she
was, her eyes shining, her face aglow with health and
understanding, her sense of being like a thread of fire in the
cold.</p>

<p>After a word of introduction Tonty left, and Lya was alone with
this great man. His handsome face was not like Tonty's, full of
temperament; it was rather set and a little stern, but there was in
it the purpose of a lifetime, and the unchanging faith and hope of
a patriot who would sacrifice himself and all with him for his
cause. Only his marvelous eyes showed the soul of the man. They
were alive and ample and lustrous, and in them was his life-long
ambition, which for the first time was caught on its course by the
spirit of a woman. He smiled at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are welcome, and may your stay be long,
mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first her heart had throbbed so that it was difficult to
speak, but the quiet steadiness of La Salle's personality restored
her balance and her heart ceased its wild beating. Yet it was not
easy to hold her poise. Her lips trembled a little as she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My stay cannot be long, monsieur, but I am better for the
coming. I am where the wheel of your great work is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In La Salle's mind was the sudden wish to say: &ldquo;Stay here
where the pivot is and help me,&rdquo; but that was madness and he
did not say it. Why did this one girl of all he had seen or known
seize so upon his powerful being?</p>

<p>Others were as beautiful and more beautiful, others were as
clever, no doubt&mdash;others as graceful, others as fine, and yet
she had her own place unrivaled. She was unique&mdash;one of those
flashes of Time that have no explanation and no traceable origin.
When her hand touched his a fire swept through his arm and body, a
vivid life. Her fingers were slim, yet her hand had firm
softness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not sit down?&rdquo; he said, and she took a
chair.</p>

<p>For a moment neither spoke, but at last he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made this dangerous journey to be with your father, I
suppose; yet why did you not come with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, then she said: &ldquo;He would not have brought
me, so I came after him. We girls are not so weak as he thinks.
I've proved it to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment La Salle looked as though he believed her, then he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have known you would do all man could do to the
level of your strength. Women have not the same physical endurance
as men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he stood up and bent towards her, looking her steadily
in the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not tell me frankly why you came?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly she rose. &ldquo;Yes, I will tell you, monsieur. I came
to warn you that you have foes in Quebec who plot your fall. They
will leave no stone unturned to do it. You have great purposes, and
they have not. You would increase trade and immigration, and they
would not&mdash;you have foes high up. That is why I came&mdash;to
warn you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled grimly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this I know. But tell me how you came to know, and
your special reason for coming. I have many foes, yet I surmount
them all. Will you not say more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pointed to the map on the table: &ldquo;There lies your
chart of action, I suppose. You are studying the possible course of
the Mississippi. You mean to build a ship and go down the
Mississippi. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so. What then, mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I look at your map, Sieur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely. It is for your eyes. There is not much to see
yet, but it is the rough drawings of what we know and what we
expect to find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she bent over the map and saw spread out the course of the
tributaries of the Mississippi, her heart rose in her like a wave.
She felt his great dream and ambition, and she would give all she
was, and could be, to help him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;I see,&rdquo; she said, and her eyes glowed,
and she pointed to the map. &ldquo;To here you know, but beyond
this you do not know, and you work to know for France's&mdash;for
Canada's sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His fine head bent over, his hand also touched the map, his eyes
shone and he had the sudden will to take her fingers in his own and
clasp her to his breast, but he put the wild thought from him, for
he had one idea and one only, and there could be no diversion from
the straight course he had drawn for himself. He must fight down
this sudden swell of human feeling. He drew back from the map.</p>

<p>Then Lya said: &ldquo;I will tell you what I know.&rdquo; She
then told of the evening at the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, and what
Duchesneau and Madame Ranard had said, and how it had weighed on
her mind, and that was why she had come to Fort Frontenac.</p>

<p>For an instant it seemed she spoke the truth, and then he felt
it was not the whole truth. Where was her father in all this? Why
had she come where her father came? What Tonty had said about
Darois in Quebec came to his mind. Was he a spy upon Du Lhut? If on
Du Lhut&mdash;why not on himself? Suddenly it flashed upon him that
she had come to warn him against her father. Why had Darois come to
Fort Frontenac? It was not imperative. Why had he come?</p>

<p>Tonty doubted him from the first, and his daughter, whose truth
was clear, had come after Darois, daring the perils of the
wilds&mdash;not on account of Duchesneau and Madame Ranard, but
because of her father. He was their agent, but the girl would not
betray her father. Yet he determined that she should&mdash;not
directly, but sufficiently. He said, seriously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know that Duchesneau and Madame Ranard and
the Jesuits are against me. I have known it long, but how does that
concern the visit of your father here? What has he to do with
Duchesneau and Madame Ranard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned slowly towards him, and her eyes took in his face
with a hidden anxiety that could not be seen save by one like La
Salle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father came on his usual business, I suppose, but how
should I know if he acts for Duchesneau and Madame Ranard and the
rest? I do not know. I am not in his mind, but if he works for
them, then I am against him too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was what La Salle suspected, but he took no advantage of
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could his coming affect my future plans? How could he
or they injure me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not obliged in your contract with King Louis to
keep so many soldiers here, and will you not build a ship? Could
they not hurt you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&mdash;yes! They could seduce away my white men,
and they could put a false pilot on my ship, that's true! Also they
could stir up the Iroquois against me! All this I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you feel it in the <i>deepest</i> part of you? Is
that so?&rdquo; She asked it with all her soul, for it seemed that
she was on the verge of tragedy and in that tragedy her father
played a part. She was set that her visit should not prove a
failure. She did not wish her father exposed, and yet she would
expose him in the last resort. Also, La Salle felt it would be
unwise, even had he proof, and there was none, to have Darois
exposed and dismissed, for that would be rupture with all
concerned. They were powerful and combined, and an open break would
be bad. He was not sure that silent watching was not best. Yet
somehow, this girl's agitation, however controlled, was not
burdened by the fact that Darois was an agent of his foes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I feel it in the deepest part of me,&rdquo; he
replied, with a stern hand on himself, for her pleading eyes got
into his soul. He knew she had not told him all, yet he could not
guess what more there was to tell, and he would not try further to
make her confess. &ldquo;I am glad you came,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;for I will keep my eyes open better now, and your father
will return soon to Quebec. I have employed one of his men to stay
here. Deslaurier is his name, and he will work with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deslaurier,&rdquo; said the girl, in slight confusion,
for she did not know the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I would not employ any of my father's men.
Suppose he works against you&mdash;acts as agent for your foes at
Quebec?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My eyes are wide open since you came, and so are Tonty's,
and we will try to keep things in the path of safety. I shall begin
my ship the <i>Griffon</i> very soon, and then we shall have the
test of loyalty and devotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly all she was, and had done, overcame him. Never had
there come to La Salle such tumult in his mind. Never had passion
and love stormed so across the moat and assailed the towers. He
first flushed red, then he turned pale, then his face became set,
and only his eyes showed what was going on in him.</p>

<p>The girl was woman enough to understand, yet it only confounded
her&mdash;that this big man should be enamored of her was like some
wild dream.</p>

<p>As it was, she could have thrown herself at his feet, so big was
her spirit with what he meant to Canada and to France. She had the
great thing in her, and yet she had no glint of love for him. He
was too far removed, too prodigious. Yet she remained looking at
him with eyes that saw what he felt, and also the fight going on in
him. She could have loved him if she had not realized that he was
not for her&mdash;that he was for the far bigger end&mdash;the
immortal hours. To be loved by such a man was a vision of life, but
she knew it was not for her. Some lesser man. She loyed La Salle as
only they can love who are free from self. It would carry her to
farthest heights of self-sacrifice and endeavor&mdash;not the love
of mother for child, or sister for brother, or child for
parent&mdash;but the holier thing, for it was removed from all
sense of relationship, except that larger affinity born of the
Eternal.</p>

<p>So she looked at him as he looked at her, and both knew, with no
words spoken, that the tale of their lives in this one sense had
been told, and that never again would such vital speech be between
them. His lips opened to speak, but no words came, and for an
instant they stood looking at each other, as though they were
meeting for the last time. He took her hand at length, and then he
spoke. There was in his face now strength of purpose, though the
fight was not all over, and could not be while she was still at
Fort Frontenac.</p>

<p>With slow, firm voice he said, &ldquo;I understand
<i>altogether</i> why you have come, and while I live I shall be
grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to a window and opened it. The strong sharp air of early
winter came in, and the sun beat down upon the opening. The window
looked into the deep, decoying woods far off, and between were the
high walls of the fort and an empty space, for no one ever camped
before this window&mdash;that La Salle had insisted on, that he had
as part of his daily rules of life, and that was why he had such
power&mdash;discipline!</p>

<p>&ldquo;These woods look south, and it is south that I am making
for&mdash;south and always south. The mouth of the Mississippi
shall be mine in the name of the King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment there was deep silence, and in it the future with
all its care and trouble and tragedy and triumph gleamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All in the name of the King!&rdquo; said Lya&mdash;no
more.</p>

<p>As she left the room his eyes followed her, and when the door
closed he sat down at the table and his head dropped in his hand.
For long he sat so.</p>

<p>At last he rose, went to the window and opened the heavy
shutters. Beyond them were the dark woods, and beyond these dark
woods was his future, his destiny, the carrying out of his
commission. He turned from the window towards the table where his
map was, then there came softly through the night the sound of an
instrument and a voice singing&mdash;a man's voice. It was that of
Jules Ladaux, who had with Luc Maste brought Lya to Fort Frontenac.
The song was tender and in the kind night mystical. These were the
words:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;I did plant a rose-tree,<br></span>
<span class="line2">Small, very pretty,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">I did plant it at night;<br></span> <span class="line0">The
next morning,<br></span> <span class="line2">The next morning I
took it up.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>La Salle did not speak aloud, but in his heart he said:
&ldquo;That is it! Sweet girl! To-night yes, but
to-morrow&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XVII</h3>

<h3>The Way Out</h3>

<p><strong>Perhaps</strong> the most acute of La Salle's followers
was Nika, the Indian, who had but one thought&mdash;to serve his
chief with a constant and faithful mind always. He had the native's
instinct, and from the first he had no faith in Tuke Darois, and
yet he had instant faith in Lya, as all did. When she came from La
Salle's room Nika saw glow in her face, and he knew there had been
a meeting which would affect their lives. He had never seen his
chief touched by thought of any woman, yet he felt she had
transformed Fort Frontenac since her coming. He could see the
change in Tonty, and he was sure that when he saw La Salle again he
would see a change in him. He watched Lya move towards her own
room, and then waited immovable, and with bowed head till he should
be summoned by La Salle. In about a half hour the summons came, and
when he entered on La Salle he saw a man over whom had passed some
vast influence. He was not outwardly changed, and yet his bearing
was more forceful, his eyes more alive than he had ever seen
them.</p>

<p>La Salle looked at Nika steadfastly for a moment, and then
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nika, you will bring all Tuke Darois' movements to me.
You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nika understood. He made an assenting gesture. There was between
these two a perfect respect&mdash;the barbarian and the high and
cultured chief, and they needed few words.</p>

<p>Presently Nika said, &ldquo;I have watch him since he
come&mdash;he must to be watched!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;what have you seen, Nika?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the eyes, so little, but with the mind&mdash;&rdquo;
he made a big enveloping gesture with his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so. Tell me the little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nika said he had seen Tuke Darois speaking to the men and with
Deslaurier in the woods, and he thought him a twisted stick. La
Salle smiled slowly, for this man was a good judge of devotion and
he was faithful. Then Nika said, &ldquo;To watch
<i>her</i>&mdash;no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes half closed, for there shot into them the memory
of her. &ldquo;No, not her&mdash;Nika, never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night after dinner, Tuke Darois came to his daughter's
room. His face was gloomy and his eyes were hard, but he knew he
must go warily. He had seen no signs of doubt in either La Salle or
Tonty, and yet he felt they did not trust him. There was no warmth
in their talk with him, yet to his daughter there was apparent
confidence.</p>

<p>He shut the door and came towards her. &ldquo;You had talks with
La Salle and Tonty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What was said between
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I warned La Salle of danger to his plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not judge? If I had told the truth would you have
been sitting at their dinner table? They do not trust you, but not
because of me. Such men are not blind&mdash;even to you so clever
and so bad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was scorn in her tone. He came close to her. &ldquo;So
bad, am I? What will you do when you go to Quebec again? Tell me
that, my wench. Is it war between us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;War! Oh no! You are my father. I will not give you up. I
will watch you in Quebec, and if you try to injure La Salle there I
will see you are stopped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears, then became dry and cold and hard.
&ldquo;I hate you for what you are, and yet I love you in a way as
my father. I could kill you and love, and because I love you kill
you. You are a pest to Canada. I will not expose you now, for that
would not be good for La Salle. It would only bring disaster to you
and evil to La Salle, for all his foes would work harder; but I
will see that La Salle is kept safe from you and all who work with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was moved by the wonderful uprightness and wisdom of his
girl. He had arranged for a false pilot for the <i>Griffon</i>, and
he had also set an evil influence in young Deslaurier at work, and
he thought that La Salle and Tonty did not know. He feared his
daughter, yet he loved her, but not sufficiently to alter his way
of life&mdash;not yet. He felt himself secure, and yet he knew she
was the strongest foe to his purposes. He could not see his way
clearly, but he knew that he must return to Quebec. He had sowed
the wind and La Salle must reap the whirlwind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We start in two days for Quebec,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Why should we wait longer here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would start to-morrow,&rdquo; said Lya. &ldquo;I have
done what I planned to do. If ill comes, you will be the
cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face became relieved and he said, &ldquo;Well, kiss me good
night, and to-morrow make ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya's face took on a somber look. &ldquo;No, I will not kiss you
good night, and to-morrow I shall make ready for our return the day
after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned. &ldquo;You would control the King's officer,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go at dawn the day after to-morrow? That I wish
to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw that if he wished to retain her affection he must be
temperate, so he said: &ldquo;Very well, your father will start
when you say, and the King's officer will go also. I can influence
him.&rdquo; He smiled futilely at his feeble joke.</p>

<p>The attempt at humor was lost on her. It was cheap, but Lya had
an inner satisfaction, for she saw that he was coming to do her
will, and that was much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to go to bed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good
night.&rdquo; She paused an instant, then she added, &ldquo;Good
night&mdash;father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, my daughter,&rdquo; and with a face in which
love and gloom and bitterness showed, he turned and left the room.
On the whole Lya had triumphed.</p>

<p>She watched him go with a strange sinking at the heart. Here was
the one being on earth related to her, and he was such a man! For a
moment she looked at the closed door, then she began to undress.
She bolted the door and then sat on the side of the bed, and her
thoughts dwelt on La Salle and Tonty. Presently she knelt and said
a prayer for herself, and for her father, with a heart that hurt
her. Then she blew out the candle. There in the dark of the night
she thought of La Salle and Tonty again, and her heart grew big
with joy to think that La Salle had been drawn towards her&mdash;to
her! Had their stars been the same, she could have loved
him&mdash;she loved him now in an everlasting way, but he was not
for her. As for Tonty, her heart leapt up. There was a man of
men&mdash;on a lower scale than La Salle, but big in his way, and
upright and a patriot, and, oh, so handsome! His metal hand was but
evidence of his bravery in war, and it gave new interest to him.
Already there was growing in her the feeling that only comes once
in this world, the first opening of the imagination and heart to
love, and imagination is bigger in all such feelings. In the soft
embrace of this exquisite illusion she slept till daylight.</p>

<p>The first person she saw when she issued from her room was Nika.
She offered him her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nika,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;you serve one of
the greatest men in all the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him&mdash;me always,&rdquo; was the slow reply.</p>

<p>So it was with Nika. He would never leave La Salle, and was with
him till the end.</p>

<p>The next person Lya saw was Tonty. Her eyes were like soft pools
of light and Tonty met her with outstretched hand. &ldquo;I am glad
that to-day we will have here a gathering of the Iroquois, and you
will see how La Salle controls them&mdash;the cleverest, cruelest,
deadliest foes that France and La Salle could have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be here at such a time is good,&rdquo; said Lya, with
features alive. &ldquo;Did you know it yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Only this morning. Couriers from the Iroquois brought
us word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya thought of her father. Would he try to influence the
Iroquois? Here was something she did not like. Her father&mdash;her
spying, treacherous father! She would warn him and watch him. She
would see him at his evil work among the terrible Iroquois, who had
slain and tortured so many and who were the best governed of all
the natives in Canada&mdash;the renowned Five Nations. She saw in
Tonty's eyes an understanding of herself. The light in them was
true, and she felt him the perfect friend of La Salle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will the Iroquois stay?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two days, perhaps&mdash;not more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These foes of France were here with one of the best friends of
France&mdash;La Salle&mdash;and one of the worst foes of
France&mdash;her father, and he would be free to talk with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be here in about three hours,&rdquo; said
Tonty. &ldquo;Come to breakfast now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At breakfast La Salle was silent, watchful, filling the place
with his presence. He had no word for Darois&mdash;he only inclined
his head; but for Lya he had a gentle smile and a word of cordial
courtesy. Then the breakfast of sagamite, fruits, salads, and fish
from the lake was eaten. La Salle ate little, but Darois
prodigiously.</p>

<p>After breakfast she went into the yard of the fort, and saw
Indians and half-breeds and Frenchmen&mdash;Luc Maste and Jules
Ladaux and others of the men who followed Du Lhut or La Salle, and
a picturesque sight it was.</p>

<p>Her father had been very silent at breakfast, but she saw his
eyes subtly flash at talk of the arrival of the Iroquois, and she
waited for him in the yard. There she said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Iroquois are coming. Remember you may pay for
treachery with your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anger leapt up in him. &ldquo;I will do what I wish, with no
thought of anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will think of me,&rdquo; she sweetly said,
&ldquo;and that will keep you from doing all you wish. Your love
for your daughter will keep you from mad things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the moment Nika passed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Indian is not an Iroquois and he hates
them&mdash;and you, too,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nika&mdash;yes, he hates the Iroquois and me,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;I feel that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then beware of what will put you in his power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In <i>his</i> power&mdash;tush! I am an officer of King
Louis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an official of the Hudson's Bay Company,&rdquo;
she said, with bitter taunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, watch the day's doings,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall watch <i>you</i>,&rdquo; was her reply.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XVIII</h3>

<h3>The Pow Pow</h3>

<p><strong>Under</strong> instructions from La Salle a feast had
been arranged for the Iroquois and all at the fort were excited.
There were Algonquins, Winnebagoes, Ottawas, Miamis, and other
Indians camped about the fort. At the coming of their ancient foes,
they were holding themselves erect and confident, for here was
their friend, La Salle, and his few soldiers, and the Iroquois
would stand no chance if they meant treachery.</p>

<p>The faces of the Iroquois were painted in all colors, and so
were their bodies, blue and red and yellow, and above all was their
marvelous headdress&mdash;distinguished and impressive. A Jesuit
writer had said of the Iroquois that &ldquo;they approach like
foxes, attack like lions, and disappear like birds.&rdquo; Yet it
was only in the woods that their great fighting qualities showed.
They seldom could defeat the French in the open, even with more
men. Their gifts were woodland gifts, their subtle minds worked
only well in the umbrage of the forest.</p>

<p>Their women, who had great influence and even became chiefs,
were experts on torture. When a prisoner was fed up against his
burning, the women were assiduous in their attentions, bringing
broth and corn and beans and wild oats or rice and a drink of dried
bilberries, and oil of sunflower to anoint them, and enticing food;
and stroked their cheeks as though they loved them.</p>

<p>The prisoner was ready for his torture when it came, and would
run the gantlet through a myriad of fires, being beaten by flaming
torches as he leaped from one end of the encampment to the other.
For hours this would go on, till at last, burned and lacerated and
broken, he would fall, never to rise again, having borne tortures
with stoic endurance.</p>

<p>If a French prisoner, he was tortured terribly. A nail would be
torn off, a finger cut off with a scallop, a piece of skin peeled
from the body, the eyes scorched out, and strips of flesh eaten.
Jogues, the Jesuit priest, when he at last escaped to France from
Albany, had been so tortured that his hands were useless, and as no
one with mutilated hands could say mass, and he was received at
court and the people surrounded and kissed his mangled fingers,
Louis XIV got from the Pope permission for Jogues to say mass
again.</p>

<p>And Jogues came back to Canada and went among the Indians who
had tortured him before; and was at last again tortured and killed.
Too much cannot be said for the Jesuits who surrendered estates and
great social place and gave themselves to hideous poverty and
danger in the wilds of Canada. Nowhere in history is there such
record of noble defiance of danger and death, and there was no
Jesuit but looked forward to being tortured and slain for the faith
to which in a vicious age he had given all that he had and was. In
their long history the evil the Jesuits did was little beside all
the good they did, for they showed in Canada the basis of the
steady discipline which, after the British conquest, gave a quiet,
steady people whose only guide was the Church, and whose steadying
influence goes on even to this day.</p>

<p>It was about noon when the first Iroquois came, and the cries of
those assembled Indians and French could be heard like a vast wind.
They came in war dress and with tomahawks raised and it looked like
war, and as they circled round, whooping, and La Salle and Tonty
watched them, they filled the yard, about two hundred, beating
their tomahawks and shrieking. The other Indians, the French and
the <i>coureurs de bois</i> watched them with malice, for their
blood was up and they would willingly have fought now, and then the
worst would have come for Canada, for the Iroquois were many and
combined. At last their Chief shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell war, farewell tomahawks. We have been fools till
now. Henceforth we will be brothers; we will be
brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they put up their tomahawks, and after the Chief had
embraced La Salle they all sat down on the mats which had been
spread, and for a long time there was a deep silence, broken only
by a concerted &ldquo;Hoh! Hoh! Hoh!&rdquo; from the Iroquois. It
was a strange sight on this lovely, bright morning. Behind La Salle
stood Tonty, Lya, her father, and Jules Ladaux and Luc Maste and De
Lussi&egrave;re and Hennepin, and at the sides the Indians who were
the ancient foes of the Iroquois&mdash;squaws, and others, even
many girls, some almost beautiful, and in their eyes hatred of
their foes. Here they all were in these far spaces, laying the
foundation of which are now vast cities of the West and South, and
would embrace Chicago, Toronto, St. Louis, New Orleans, and vast
populations.</p>

<p>At last La Salle stood up and began to speak with belts of
wampum in his hands. He said he was their faithful friend save when
attacked, and that his great master Frontenac, who acted for the
King of all the world, had ordered him to give presents, and so he
now gave them cloth. There lay before the chiefs rolls of cloth.
Then overcoats were given, and tobacco, to the shrill applause of
the Iroquois; then other presents&mdash;hatchets and knives and
axes&mdash;La Salle walking up and down like an actor, opening his
heart to them, eloquent and convincing. In dealing with natives, La
Salle could succeed where others failed. Though he had no
confidence that what he was now doing would have permanent results,
he did it with an air of certainty. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been foes, my brothers, now we are one family.
Here at Fort Frontenac you come and get all you need for your
camps. You are powerful, but I come of a race more powerful. You
may defeat us once or twice, or ten times, but we have men without
number and untold wealth, and in the end we triumph. We mean well
by you&mdash;we are your brothers&mdash;we are sworn to you by the
crucifix which here we raise above you.&rdquo; He pointed to the
crucifix near the building. It stood high and dominant. &ldquo;It
is our totem, and all our sachems and councilors and chiefs of the
Grand Monarch bow before it. It is the only symbol that lasts, it
belongs to all the ages. It is the one thing that lives when we all
go to the happy hunting grounds where there is peace for all. It
has been the conquering sign for sixteen hundred years. It is the
key of the Hereafter&mdash;the only <i>oki</i> in the universe. It
is the true hope and faith of millions who are to you as the stars
of heaven to the leaves upon one tree. Be sure, my brothers, that
we are here to stay. Yesterday we saw sun dogs&mdash;a sign of
warmer weather. You point your javelins upward against Jannava, the
Thunder Demon, to divert him from his purposes. We also point our
javelins upward in defiance against the demons of disorder and
misrule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wish only to clasp you to our hearts and live in
peace. The sky of our God and His Church is over all, and while
life lasts we are your brothers. Look how glad the world is
to-day&mdash;all sun. It is the sun of life that is in our hearts
to you. Our King is called the Sun King. He warms all those who
serve him well. I pray you be his children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had finished, the Chief stood up and, clasping his arms
around La Salle in his handsome scarlet tunic and laces and plumed
hat, said to his men, his black eyes glowing: &ldquo;As I embrace
this brother, so we all embrace their faith. Their Oki shall be our
Oki, their God our God&mdash;and I have spoken!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoh! Hoh! Hoh!&rdquo; said all the Iroquois, their hands
clapping their mouths with assent, and all in the yard shouted
assent, for La Salle's speech had conquered all&mdash;save a few
like Darois&mdash;and some Iroquois, who yet were for combat.</p>

<p>When this was ended, the feast was brought&mdash;after the
calumet pipe had been smoked by La Salle and the chief, and it had
been passed to others. It was in great kettles and
apart&mdash;Indian corn, green peas, beans, prunes, eels and fat,
fresh salmon, sturgeon and wild pigeons, squirrels, deer's meat,
partridge, quail, black birds, owls, and fish from the lake. Dried
berries soaked in warm water were used as a sauce to the food not
in the kettles, and a nut-meat gravy used with squash, and pumpkins
and potatoes; and all ate greedily with spoons made of bark. La
Salle had arranged that as they ate there should be music, and so
there was music by drum, trumpet and cymbal, and a violin played by
Jules Ladaux, and as they all gazed and ate freely, hens fluttered
about picking up bits dropped by the feasters, and dogs snatched
pieces of food let fall.</p>

<p>Tuke Darois had listened to La Salle with hidden hatred, for he
saw the effect on the Iroquois, but Lya felt the greatness of the
man. His gifts were rare, and he had captured the Iroquois, who
loved rhetoric and saw in him a master of it. She stood near La
Salle, with Tonty beside her, and her face shone while La Salle
talked. Many eyes were turned to her, and she knew she was watched
closely by the Iroquois, who had tried to kill her as she came to
Fort Frontenac. That did not disturb her. She was alive to their
duplicity, yet she saw that all was well for the moment. She
watched her father. She knew he was not the fool&mdash;to be
treacherous in the open day with Nika watching. The day drew on,
and it was late in the afternoon the feasting ceased. It was clear
at last that the Iroquois meant to stay the night. La Salle had
prepared. He ordered that they should all sleep in the huge yard,
and that they should not go among the other Indians or into the
woods.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XIX</h3>

<h3>At the Gateway</h3>

<p><strong>Night</strong> fell under a shower of stars and a young
moon. The Iroquois wrapped themselves in their robes of beaver furs
decorated inside with painted figures and by the quills of the
hedgehog. Some wore their hair loose on one side and tight-braided
on the other. Others were close shaved, with one or more cherished
locks. A few women with long black hair gathered behind their necks
wore disks of copper and were gay in beads, and lay among them, and
Fort Frontenac was in the circle of peace&mdash;outwardly.</p>

<p>Yet La Salle took no chances. It would have been impossible for
the foe&mdash;if such they still were&mdash;to have made successful
attack. Indeed, they had no wish to do so. They were for the moment
at peace and the presents given had been ample. Besides, they were
in numbers fewer than their hosts.</p>

<p>One chief had noticed a curious look in the face of an
official&mdash;Tuke Darois&mdash;and had gathered that he wished
speech with him. He knew the official not to belong to La Salle,
but to Quebec&mdash;told so by one of the <i>coureurs do bois</i>.
For long he lay on the edge of the crowd of Indians and at last
fell asleep. He was waked about three in the morning by a tug at
his robe, and a voice whispered, &ldquo;Follow me,
chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose and followed Tuke Darois to a corner of the yard where
there was little light. Darois, speaking Iroquois well, said in a
low voice: &ldquo;Why are you friends with La Salle&mdash;you and
your Five Nations? He is your foe and the foe of all great
merchants in this country. He does not mean well by you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to-day is not to-morrow,&rdquo; said the Chief,
ironically, and his look was ugly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is to-day should not be at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Treachery was part of the policy of the Chief and all his
friends, but he had not looked for it in a Frenchman. His black
eyes fastened on Darois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your King gives him orders&mdash;your Governor helps him.
What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He takes away your trade and the trade of the merchants.
He will become rich and powerful and a tyrant here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chief said naught at first; then he laughed a low, morose
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can destroy them all, but we choose not
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there should come to you all&mdash;wealth,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got no further, for Nika, the servant of La Salle, came
softly and he said: &ldquo;Sleep time. Let be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Darois with anger turned away, and the Chief sullenly went
back and lay down. At the door of the fort Nika said to Darois,
&ldquo;Night is sleep time&mdash;yes.&rdquo; With a look of fury
Darois entered the fort and went to his room.</p>

<p>In the morning Nika reported the meeting to La Salle, who had
expected it, but the explorer said naught save that he would see
Darois left that day for Quebec. His face clouded, for he was sorry
for Lya, and he told all to Tonty.</p>

<p>At breakfast time Du Lhut and twenty of his men arrived on the
scene, and they were received with clamor by the Indians and all at
the fort, who had not expected them. The Iroquois were preparing to
leave, but they joined in the welcome, and Du Lhut gave all
cheerful greetings. The Iroquois and the French respected him, for,
though he broke the law, he was high in favor with Frontenac.</p>

<p>After greetings with La Salle and Tonty he saw Tuke Darois and
his daughter. He had heard of their coming, and he felt by instinct
that Darois was his own foe and the foe of La Salle. His greeting
to Darois was distant, but to his daughter sincere and emphatic. To
her he gently said: &ldquo;I see you here in the wilds where never
has been a white woman. Your coming has done good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her eyes in friendship. &ldquo;I have seen what never
else I could have seen, and I return with my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment Luc Maste and Jules Ladaux came to Du Lhut, and
their welcome was warm. &ldquo;We brought her here, m'sieu',&rdquo;
they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brought her here? Then she did not come with her
father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle intervened. &ldquo;Her father would not bring her, but
she came. He will, however, take her back to Quebec. <i>All has goe
well</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said these last words, he looked hard at Darois, who bowed
low. &ldquo;It goes well with Sieur de la Salle always,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Three hours later, when the sun was hot and the woods showy with
autumn colors, and the Iroquois had gone, Darois and Lya stood at
the gate with three <i>habitants</i>, and said farewell to La Salle
and Tonty and Du Lhut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A safe journey,&rdquo; said Du Lhut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A strong tide with you,&rdquo; said Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will soon be there,&rdquo; said La Salle.</p>

<p>Darois made no reply, but shrank a little from the stern eyes of
La Salle. As she looked into La Salle's eyes Lya said: &ldquo;You
will find your way to the mouth of the Mississippi. That will be
yours and France's glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's face shone with the light of ambition and hope, and
then came another look&mdash;it was the struggle between love and
duty to a cause, and it turned her eyes to Tonty. Tonty came close
to Lya. He took her hand, pressed it warmly, and looked into his
eyes. This look said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have given a new sun for my sky. You have planted in
my heart the seeds of love. You have set aflame the vast prairie of
the future. I shall walk in the fire and shall come out ready to
kill Goliath. Look into my eyes&mdash;tell me if you understand
child of life and love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this was said without words, but the girl understood, and
into her eyes there came a moisture of Eden. There were no words,
but the language of the soul was there. She smiled at him, and he
breathed quickly in emotion, and then kissed her hand.</p>

<p>La Salle saw all and at first he had a bitter pang, then the
spirit of renunciation came upon him. He knew that the girl loved
him in a deep, mysterious way in which there was no passion. He
knew she felt him far removed from her, and with powerful will he
mastered himself and said, &ldquo;So&mdash;so, it is the hand of
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle watched her go with conquest in his eyes. <i>That</i>
was over, and he must fact the unknown but hopeful future. He
smiled at Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All shall go well,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XX</h3>

<h3>The Building of the &ldquo;Griffon&rdquo;</h3>

<p><strong>One</strong> day months after their journey to Fort
Frontenac Lya received a letter from Tonty.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>Dear Mademoiselle:</p>

<p>I know you would hear what has chanced since you left us that
black day, taking the sun from our sky. I have never forgotten you
one moment&mdash;never can. You are always here. La Salle and I
started for Niagara to the fort built by Hennepin and De
Lussi&egrave;re. On Christmas Eve we were near wrecked in the Bay
of Quint&eacute; by a treacherous pilot. La Salle would do naught
with this pilot, for he risked his own life with that of La Salle,
and so a Jesuit would without hesitation&mdash;eternal reward would
be his. I see La Salle with the man before him. &ldquo;Not again,
not again, monsieur!&rdquo; he said and dismissed him. In such wise
had La Salle conquered the would-be murderer, Jolycoeur, and it
will ever be so with him. He is too gigantic to be moved.</p>

<p>When we came to the Seneca town, he spoke to the assembled
chiefs, who had been eloquently but hopelessly addressed by
Hennepin, and his reasoning, that building a vessel for trade would
be good, at last convinced them, and they smoked the pipe of peace
and took his presents with applause. When things are at their worst
with La Salle, he can get money for his enterprises and gain the
confidence of the most unlikely people. His cousin, Fran&ccedil;ois
Plet, from whom he borrowed, is coming to Canada, and La Salle will
have him conduct the business at Port Frontenac.</p>

<p>So with the Senecas, he left them with good will behind him, and
came on to the lovely, stupendous and gorgeous Niagara, all
thundering and bright with color and shining! At Niagara La Salle's
vessel was wrecked on the coast, and only the anchors and cables
for a new vessel to be built were saved. On the high point where
Fort Niagara now stands, La Salle marked out two block-houses, one
of which he called Fort Conti. Then, after a time, hearing bad news
from Quebec, he set out on foot for Fort Frontenac&mdash;two
hundred and fifty miles through the Iroquois country and ice of
Lake Ontario. He and his comrades had at last only a bag of parched
corn and they made the last two days fasting.</p>

<p>It was left for me to finish the vessel at Niagara, which I did.
She was forty-five tons and she was called the <i>Griffon</i>. When
she was finished a Te Deum was sung and the Indians were loud in
their excitement. La Salle had said he would make the
<i>Griffon</i> fly above the crows&mdash;make Frontenac triumph
over the Jesuits! We made her fast in the swift current and waited
long for La Salle. Spring and more than half the summer passed and
only in August he appeared, calm and reserved. He brought a tale of
disaster. His foes had seized all his property and the Intendant
had placed a seal on his furs at Quebec.</p>

<p>The <i>Griffon</i> was forced up the current by tow-ropes and
sails till she reached Lake Erie. So we sailed this great lake to
the Strait of Detroit, entered Lake St. Clair, and went on to Lake
Huron. We had a wonderful journey, and passed through a noble
country&mdash;had plenty of game and were in high spirits. Then a
vast storm came and we were in grave danger. All fell to prayers
and La Salle vowed that St. Anthony of Padua should have a chapel
if we were saved. St. Anthony heard our prayers! We moved on till
we came to St. Ignace of Michillimackinac. Here were Jesuit
priests, their home and chapel, inclosed with palisades, compact
houses of French traders, and grouped wigwams of an Ottawa village,
a Huron village with its cabins and its fence of tall pickets, and
they all gave La Salle warm welcome. At the Ottawa village La Salle
heard mass in mantle of scarlet fringed with gold, with soldiers,
sailors, artisans, black Jesuits, gray Recollets and Indians who
called the <i>Griffon</i> &ldquo;a floating fort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You see how troubled is our way. Thus we move forward over seamy
cracks and on the edge of chasms. If my will was not as hard as my
left hand, I could not carry on. When I strike a bad Indian with my
metal hand, he says, not knowing what it is, &ldquo;Great
medicine!&rdquo; He does not know it is artificial. He thinks it is
the devil in me. So with the will, when it strikes with Heaven
behind it&mdash;the reply is &ldquo;Great medicine!&rdquo; Even the
Church cannot conquer when the saints are with the metal will. That
is how it will be with La Salle in the end.</p>

<p>At Green Bay, near Lake Michigan in the country of the
Menomonies and Sacs Indians, La Salle made the one great error of
his career. Here he found faithful servants who had collected furs,
and he sent these furs in the <i>Griffon</i> to satisfy his
creditors. She set sail for Niagara, and I cannot forget how I felt
when it was done, for the <i>Griffon</i> was his true source of
income, his perfect capital for the future. Yet he trusted her to
an inimical pilot, he who had lost the small vessel on the Niagara.
Then La Salle with fourteen men and loaded canoes left for the
Illinois River. It was a hard journey for La Salle. Storms pursued
him, and great difficulties stayed their progress. Things grew bad.
The men paddled all day with only Indian corn, and sick with haws
and wild berries, and La Salle gave them a confection of hyacinth
to make them well. But we came at last upon plenty of bear's meat
and buzzards and wild grapes.</p>

<p>Then the boatmen began to pick up spirit and to sing. They had
great numbers of chansons, and, though primitive, have point always
and an allusiveness not found among the Latins and the Celts. As
they paddled one started a song of the river which I have often
heard. He was thinking of his home, and of the market-place, and as
he sang all his comrades joined him:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;When the lame girl goes to
market,<br></span> <span class="line2">She never goes without her
basket,<br></span> <span class="line0">She never goes without her
basket,<br></span> <span class="line2">Niou, ioup-&egrave;-nif,
&egrave;-nif, &egrave;-nif, &egrave;-nif,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">She never goes without her basket.<br></span> <span class=
"line4">&ldquo;Lir lon, fa, ma lura dond&eacute;.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>As he sang in the bright morning, a tender bite in the air and
the sky cloudless and vibrant, all the voyageurs' eyes shone and
they were transformed from wild woodmen and boatmen into men of
home and quiet days. Even La Salle's eyes showed how much this
domestic spirit touched him. He smiled and he joined in the
refrain:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Lir lon, fa, ma lura
dond&eacute;.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>The party in eight canoes, numbering thirty-three, ascended the
St. Joseph, looking for the portage leading to the headquarters of
the Illinois. As we made our way to the head of the Illinois and
could see far off the lodges of the Miamis, one Duplessis, an agent
of Darois, raised his gun to shoot La Salle in the back, but his
comrades stopped him. I knew of this, but did not tell La Salle,
for it could do no good and Duplessis stayed with us. But I
challenged him and he has now promised loyalty. He was a man of
spasmodic emotions. In this I followed the example of La Salle.</p>

<p>Right and left were the prairies, with gray wintry forests and
strewn with carcasses of buffaloes. Food became scarce, and all
Nika, the Shawanoe, could shoot were two lean deer with a few wild
geese and swans, and crows and owls. At length came a wonderful
country with wooded hills and green prairie, a pasturage for
buffalo and deer. Near by was a high cliff called Starved Rock,
crested with trees, and along the right bank of the river were the
lodges of a great Indian settlement built of frame-work of poles,
covered with mats and rushes. This vast town was empty of people,
but we found the caches in covered pits where was hid their stock
of corn. La Salle hesitated, but at last took thirty minots of
corn, hoping to compensate the Indians later.</p>

<p>At last they saw the Illinois wigwams on both sides of the
river. The eight canoes were placed in line abreast. The men laid
down their paddles and seized their guns, and the current brought
them to the Indian camp. Here came immense excitement. The Indians
snatched bows and war clubs, and all fiercely shrieked and howled,
but La Salle with his little group of armed men landed and prepared
to light. But a chief came with a calumet, and La Salle showed
another. The uproar was stopped, and feasting began, and the
Frenchmen were fed by the fingers of the Indians, and their feet
were rubbed with bear's grease.</p>

<p>La Salle gave tobacco and hatchets, and told them of the thirty
minots of corn, for which he offered, and they accepted payment. He
told them he meant to travel the Mississippi to the sea, and if
they would not help him he would go to the Osages, their foes, who
would reap the benefits of trade. This conquered them, and they
feasted late, but still La Salle kept watch.</p>

<p>That night a Mascoutin chief, Monso, brought knives, hatchets,
and kettles to the Illinois. He warned them against La Salle, and
denounced him as a friend of the Iroquois, who would stir up the
Mississippi tribes to join against the Illinois. Omawha, a friendly
chief, came secretly to La Salle and told him all.</p>

<p>Next day Nicanop&eacute;, brother of the head chief, gave a
feast. Before the feast Nicanop&eacute; warned them against the
Mississippi, saying it had savage tribes, and the waters were full
of alligators and serpents and whirlpools.</p>

<p>This had effect upon La Salle's followers, but La Salle coolly
told them he knew what Monso had done, and as for enmity, they
could have slain their tribes without help from the Iroquois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even now,&rdquo; La Salle said, boldly, &ldquo;we could
put you all to death with your young men away. But we have brought
you goods and tools! Bring back this coward, Monso, who comes and
goes in the night, and let me face him.&rdquo; After a moment,
Nicanop&eacute; grunted assent, and the feast went on all day. But
La Salle kept guard at night as before, and in the morning found
that six of his men had fled. He summoned the rest before him and
said they should all return to Quebec in the spring if they would
have it so.</p>

<p>La Salle left the Indian camp, and a half league below, on a low
hill two hundred yards from the southern beach, he set his camp. On
either side was a deep ravine and in front a marshy tract
overflowed at high water. They dug a ditch between the two ravines,
and an embankment was made and it was guarded by a
<i>chevaux-de-frise</i> and a palisade twenty-five feet high was
built. The fort was called Fort Cr&egrave;vecoeur.</p>

<p>Here came news to La Salle that the <i>Griffon</i> was no more.
A young Indian joined his camp and told him that he saw a white man
of the description of the pilot of the <i>Griffon</i> among a tribe
beyond the Mississippi. With four others he had been captured while
traveling to the Sioux in canoes loaded with goods. This fixed in
La Salle's mind that the <i>Griffon</i> was lost. One day a young
Illinois coming from a distant war excursion came upon La Salle,
who gave him a turkey and other presents, and learned the truth
about the Mississippi. La Salle added to his presents a hatchet,
and made him promise to say naught to his people.</p>

<p>Then he went to the camp of the Illinois, and at a feast of
bear's meat sat upon the rushes and smoked with them. At last he
rose and said they had tried to deceive him, but the Master of Life
had said to him all was well on the Mississippi. He told them
something of what he had heard. His astonished hearers clapped
their mouths and confessed that all they had said meant that he
should stay with them. Later when a band of Chickasaws, Arkansas,
and Osages warriors told him that the river was navigable to the
sea, La Salle's followers took heart again.</p>

<p>Then La Salle said he would not wait to get pit-sawyers, but
would himself build a vessel, if he could get men to help him. They
responded, and within six weeks the hold of the vessel was half
finished.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the parting with La Salle when, with Nika
and four Frenchmen he marched to Fort Frontenac for necessities
lost in the <i>Griffon</i>, or we should be retarded a whole year.
The forest was still leafless, and the ground frozen. Near by was
the unfinished ship upon the stocks. In La Salle was not only
unconquerable will, but anxiety, too, for this journey would test
not only his endurance, but his faith in himself. Yet to the eye,
all to be seen was a firm, serene face.</p>

<p>I was to remain behind with about three honest men and a dozen
scoundrels to hold Fort Cr&egrave;vecoeur in his absence. It was a
journey of about five hundred leagues in a direct line, and the
dangers of meeting hostile Indians was great. They watched by night
and marched by day, loaded with baggage-blankets, clothing,
kettles, hatchets, gunpowder, lead, and skins to make moccasins.
Sometimes pushing through marshes, they had to carry their canoes.
Again and again progress was barred.</p>

<p>Day by day they toiled among pools and snow and ice, and at last
they came to Peoria Lake, sheeted with ice, and dragged canoes half
a league, launched them, and again had to take to the woods; but a
sharp frost came and they could use their snowshoes. At last they
reached the great town of the Illinois, empty of its people, where
they got food by killing buffalo, and they met Illinois Indians. La
Salle feasted then, and induced a promise to send food to us at
Fort Cr&egrave;vecoeur. Later they made a desperate journey in the
bitter cold, when the prairie was mud and water and snow, and came
at length to the fort they had raised at the mouth of the St.
Joseph. At length after hard trials, dogged by sickness, they built
a canoe and floated in it down the Huron River. Lake Erie was
reached, and in snow, sleet, and rain they made for Niagara.</p>

<p>Here La Salle found men who confirmed not only that the
<i>Griffon</i> was lost, but that a ship from France loaded with
goods for him had been wrecked, and that twenty hired men had been
detained by his foe, Duchesneau, at Quebec.</p>

<p>Undaunted still, he traveled a thousand miles through a country
beset with perils to Fort Frontenac. There he found his friends had
plundered him, his creditors had seized his property, and canoes
laden with furs had been lost in the St. Lawrence. So he hastened
to Montreal there to face the enmity against him.</p>

<p>This is my sad tale, and it only tells a true friend what we
have been doing since the winter fell between us and her good eyes.
Our ship has far to go, and the perils are great, but we have one
unchangeable star and by it we sail. It is La Salle. He is our
North Star and our Southern Cross. And so, with quenchless
admiration, most dear mademoiselle, goes to you the friendliest
thoughts.</p>

<p>Henri De Tonty.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXI</h3>

<h3>The Dark Corners</h3>

<p><strong>Arriving</strong> at Quebec City, La Salle went at once
to the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis and was received most warmly by
Count Frontenac. He had come straight from the shore to the
Ch&acirc;teau in the dim evening, and was recognized by very few as
he passed; but one of the few was Darois, who took the news to the
house of Madame Ranard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, thrice welcome, La Salle,&rdquo; said Frontenac.
&ldquo;God knows, I wished news of you, and you bring them! Black
things are said about you, and done to you, but you survive them
all. What has chanced since you left here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the long two hours La Salle took in telling his grim tale,
Frontenac sat enthralled, or walked slowly up and down, having
given orders against interruption, his big eyes fixed on La Salle's
face. Now and then he would ask a swift question.</p>

<p>When La Salle had finished his rare and piercing story,
Frontenac said: &ldquo;The facts are these, then: you have lost the
<i>Griffon</i>, you have lost canoes of furs, your goods from
France has been wrecked in the St. Lawrence, your property has been
seized, your men from France have been detained, your credit is at
its lowest ebb, your forts have been destroyed, your men have
deserted from you, you have been the victim of treachery. They
think you are ruined. Your foes and mine would destroy us both. Is
that not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so, Your Excellency, but I have no fear while you
believe in me. With you behind me, I can live on&mdash;fight
on&mdash;and win in the end.&rdquo; La Salle reached out a firm
hand and opened and shut it with vigor.</p>

<p>Frontenac smiled and laid a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;La
Salle, La Salle, if there were a few like you in this country,
naught could defeat us. We have against us powerful folk&mdash;the
Bishop, the Jesuits, the Intendant, and their friends, but we must
be confident and fearless. In Paris you fought them and you won,
and in Canada you will do the same. What I fear most is that they
will poison the minds of the Iroquois, who will destroy the Hurons,
the Neutrals, the Eries, Andastes and Algonquins; inveigle the
Miamis, and attack and destroy the Illinois. They league to prevent
your trading, and they will stop at naught. They care not for
consequences, if you are destroyed and trade is prevented and they
can sell brandy and furs themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes darkened, a frown came on his forehead, then suddenly
his face cleared and he said: &ldquo;They cannot beat me thus. I
have the King and Colbert and Seignelay with me, and so have you.
They can injure, but they cannot destroy. We shall win&mdash;you
and I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle got to his feet, for this was one who had in him the
splendid faith that made himself what he was&mdash;intrepid and
unshakable. He now determined to tell Frontenac about Tuke
Darois.</p>

<p>He said: &ldquo;Excellency, there is in the employ of the
Intendant and the Ranards an astute foe. It is Tuke
Darois.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Governor's eyes flashed. &ldquo;Tuke Darois&mdash;that man!
Yes, it may be so. I have never trusted him. Yet his
daughter&mdash;I think there is a girl of truth and
faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled half pensively. &ldquo;She&mdash;she is straight
and true.&rdquo; Then he told of her visit to Fort Frontenac and
what had chanced there. &ldquo;She is as true as he is false, and
she is with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac laughed outright: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I heard she had
gone the stark journey to Fort Frontenac, but I did not guess why.
He can do less harm with her watching him than if he were
dismissed. I could have him dismissed, but is it wise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's face shone now with a new light. &ldquo;It is not
wise, Your Excellency, and he should be left where he is at
present&mdash;the tool of the Intendant and Madame
Ranard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac stamped a foot lightly on the floor. &ldquo;Do they
think, these silly folk, that they ruin us! I say us, because your
fate and mine are one. Both want the glory of France and Canada
more than aught else, and Canada first&mdash;always
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac then went into the question of furs&mdash;trade in the
West. He questioned concerning trade with the tribes in the Huron
and Illinois country, and applauded the effective concentration at
Fort Frontenac. He said La Salle would find money in Quebec, and he
would see that his men should be released by the Intendant and be
free to work for him. La Salle had been wise to Visit Quebec, for
he could start again with new power.</p>

<p>La Salle's face underwent many changes as they talked. It was as
though Frontenac gave him a new commission, new impetus. He had
little demonstration, but he showed in his eyes the enthusiasm of
his soul. They were the windows of his inner life, the power-house
of his purposes.</p>

<p>When he left the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, he walked towards his
lodgings with a heart cheered by his talk with Frontenac. Somehow
he felt that in spite of all he would prevail. As he passed from
the Ch&acirc;teau and footed it in the moonlit night, he heard from
the windows of a house this song:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Michau kept vigil<br></span>
<span class="line0">The evening in his cottage,<br></span>
<span class="line0">Near the hamlet<br></span> <span class=
"line0">He guarded his flock.<br></span> <span class="line0">The
heavens sparkled<br></span> <span class="line0">With a brilliant
light,<br></span> <span class="line0">And he began to
sing:<br></span> <span class="line0">&lsquo;I am, I am the star of
the shepherd,<br></span> <span class="line0">I am, I am the star of
the shepherd.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>This was a chanson of his native Normandy, and it startled him
now. He raised his face to the star-lit sky and his heart beat
faster. It cheered and inspired him&mdash;the Star of the Shepherd.
He was the shepherd and his star was above him. A quiet smile
lighted his face.</p>

<p>In this city were forces working against him of which he knew,
but it did not affect him now.</p>

<p>Tuke Darois had gone straight to Madame Ranard and in her house
had said, &ldquo;That mad devil has come again to Quebec and has
gone to the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Ranard fiercely said: &ldquo;He is mad, but he is clever,
and he is hard to defeat with Frontenac at his back. He is on the
verge of financial and political ruin. You did well to come at
once. You had his <i>Griffon</i> sunk, and other of his vessels and
canoes, and the work you do is good. But in your daughter we have a
foe. She went to Fort Frontenac to stop you. It was brave, but it
was as mad as aught that La Salle or his friend Tonty do. You have
little power over her, I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power to prevent her having me dismissed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dismissed! Why dismissed? You are not Frontenac's
servant. You are employed by the Intendant under my
husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not know that he was a Hudson's Bay Company spy, and no
one save his daughter knew, and her tongue was tied. Even Madame
Ranard and Duchesneau would not have kept a spy of the Hudson's Bay
Company in their employ. They only knew him as the foe of Du Lhut
and La Salle and so they had employed him.</p>

<p>It enraged Barbe Ranard to think that La Salle should defeat her
purposes, and always when she seemed on the edge of success. She
was a woman who would sell her soul for men's favors, and she could
not resist now playing, even with her tool, as he was. She looked
into his eyes with a soft passion that inflamed his blood. She
uncovered herself spiritually before his eyes, and he thirsted for
this exquisite being higher in social life.</p>

<p>At last she said: &ldquo;I will see the Intendant and he must
stop this madman from restoring himself. If there were men in
Quebec of real character he would have no chance. He is a cog in
the wheel that stops its progress, and that cog should not be
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darois knew what she meant. &ldquo;There <i>are</i> men of
character in Quebec,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that cog can be
removed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She eyed him sharply, and when she heard his words, with a smile
she bade him good-by. With a dark look, she saw him leave the room.
Then she put on a cloak and hat and went to the Intendant's
palace.</p>

<p>It was a huge building, once a brewery built by Talon, and had
been a center of intrigue and evil, and here Madame Ranard came to
plot with this good-looking, dark and able cavalier. He was the
slave of his passion, and, now that her husband was away, she could
go more freely to him. She arrived at the palace in about a half an
hour and was at once shown into the office of Duchesneau. She
accepted his embrace, and said: &ldquo;We have work to do, my
Jacques. La Salle has returned to Quebec.&rdquo; He started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My secret service lack precision. Who has seen
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tuke Darois saw him and came straight to me. La Salle
went at once to the Ch&acirc;teau, less than an hour ago. He is
there with Frontenac. The two can do bad work.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="image">[image: Fran&ccedil;ois de Laval]</p>

<p>&ldquo;They cannot put La Salle back where he was. He is
financially ruined; his day is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not over. If he had not come to Quebec&mdash;yes; but he
is here and he gets what he wants, as he did at Versailles with so
much against him&mdash;with you and the Jesuits and myself against
him. Yet he triumphed in a big way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her foot beat the floor angrily, her eyes flashed fire, her face
took on the look of one who would ruin the world for her own dark
purposes. &ldquo;Oh, I could tear my eyes out when I think of it,
and even Frontenac's wife insulted me. The female
Mephisto!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau almost laughed. It was so strange to see this clever,
beautiful woman in a rage. &ldquo;Yes, he beat us all there, but he
cannot do it here, for we have the whip hand. All&mdash;nearly all
merchants are against him. I see no chance for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had the brains of a born diplomatist, the heart of a
vulture, yet her lips werd like rose leaves, and her eyes like
lights of heaven. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not so sure. Do not think him of no account. Something
in him gets what he wants in the end.
Somehow&mdash;somehow&mdash;&rdquo; She shivered, for it seemed, no
matter what was done, he conquered. She had set Jolycoeur to poison
him, she had incited Darois to get Duplessis to kill him, she had
arranged again for him to be poisoned by an evil huntsman, and yet
he had come through it all with no ill results. Somehow he baffled
her, and she showed perturbation now. This great Intendant had not
defeated him. He controlled finance and justice, and was the big
policeman of the country, and yet was beaten. She wished she was in
the Intendant's place, and yet what could she do? It did not matter
that they were acting against the best interests of the country.
They did not think of that. It was each for himself, and the devil
take the rest!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow he arrives,&rdquo; she said, with despairing
malice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not yield like that,&rdquo; said Duchesneau. &ldquo;We
have work to do. We shall beat him even with Frontenac behind him.
Frontenac is with him for gain's sake, for naught else, and
together they work for money, not for France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are two clever men together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren't you and I as clever as they?&rdquo; he asked,
almost sullenly.</p>

<p>She looked him in the eyes. &ldquo;Yes, we are&mdash;almost, but
not quite, for they are concentrated and work in one mind&mdash;two
powerful factors toiling as one. We are powerful, but we are
concentrated in <i>ourselves</i> and that makes all the difference.
We are less powerful because we love, and they do not love each
other, but they love what they do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we only think of the state!&rdquo; Duchesneau said
with a hoarse laugh, for he had a sense of humor, and was only
small because he was in the hands of this creature who would
imperil the biggest man that ever lived. &ldquo;Only the
state!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>She flushed with anger. &ldquo;Only the state&mdash;only that
which would make the state better than it is. But if it were only
the state we should never be successful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We get nowhere just the same,&rdquo; he said,
sententiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us plan to get somewhere while La Salle is in Quebec.
He thinks of one thing ever. We are not bound to one idea for every
hour in our days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are bound to one idea always,&rdquo; he
said&mdash;&ldquo;you and I. From that we shall win what we
will.&rdquo;</p>
<br>

<p>A little later she laid her hands on his shoulders. She said
with irony: &ldquo;My friend, while we play he works, and we must
act now, if we are to win. France is at stake, and we should think
of her and of Canada, which would be lost to France if this man has
his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau laughed softly. &ldquo;France&mdash;yes, we think of
her always; and are working against King, Minister, and Governor to
save this child of France from everlasting perdition. Now what
shall we do first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For long they sat and talked with ominous look; their hands came
close together and they nodded and affirmed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in another home a girl was learning from her father
that La Salle was in Quebec.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do?&rdquo; she asked, with trouble in
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not for me to do aught,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for the Intendant and Madame Ranard!&rdquo; Lya
replied, and from his face she knew that she had guessed
right&mdash;in a way.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXII</h3>

<h3>&ldquo;Spy of the Hudson's Bay Company&mdash;Go!&rdquo;</h3>

<p><strong>Next</strong> day all Quebec was excited by the news
that La Salle had returned. He had a bitter interview with his
brother, the Abb&eacute;, who sharply told him that his misfortunes
were due to his own lack of judgment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother Abb&eacute;,&rdquo; said La Salle, &ldquo;you
have not yet lost by me, and you never shall. I have been struck
hard before, yet I have won, and I shall win again. I turn my face
to each blow, and you see it determined still. You never wholly
believed in me&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; twisted in his chair, and his thin, ascetic face
wrinkled, for he had not the great control of his
brother&mdash;priest though he was&mdash;and he said, acidly:
&ldquo;I have always believed in your will and purposes, but not
always in your way of doing things. You see far for this country,
but you spoil all by mistaken ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistaken ways? Abb&eacute;, how can you judge? You don't
see my daily life, and you would not wholly understand it&mdash;I
know not why. At times you have helped me, as when I came from
France last, but again you obstruct me. The world is not blind, and
when a brother is not upheld by brother, that shakes their faith. I
have been hard hit of late, but it does not break me. I go
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got to his feet and held out his hands in appeal. &ldquo;I
never <i>beg</i> assistance, yet here now I beg you to stand by me.
You shall lose naught. I can pay you back all I owe you, and will
before I leave Quebec. I want more than your money. I want your
faith, your love, your outstretched hand. I live a life that bears
scrutiny. I am sober, honest, and clean in spirit. Never have my
foes proved a single bad act on my past. Jean&mdash;Jean, stand by
me, and give me your blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes were hot, his face was shining with rapt faith, his
body was tense with feeling, and even the Abb&eacute;'s small soul
was impressed. He had some temperament, he felt the force of all La
Salle said. His hand suddenly came out in blessing, and he said
with feeling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will have faith. The great thing is in you. God be
good to you and give you success in this world and peace in the
next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shoulders of La Salle straightened, his face grew brighter,
his lips pressed firmly together, and his inner life was shown, for
he said in almost broken tones:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give me greater faith in myself than I have ever
known. I feel I am at one of the turning points of my fate.
Something will happen before I leave Quebec to put me
right&mdash;something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes were looking far beyond his brother and this room. The
Abb&eacute;'s eyes were moist, and they were seldom moist with
feeling, and he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have much against you, but you have that which
conquers all. What can I do to help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled softly. &ldquo;You have helped me. You are with
me, and that is the great thing. I do not fear the future. My work
will live when I am done with life and time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon after they parted, and the Abb&eacute; watched him go with
the first stirring of real affection he had ever had. As the door
closed behind La Salle, he said: &ldquo;Robert, you have the soul
of a pioneer and a martyr, of a soldier and a poet&mdash;of a
patriot; first and last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had La Salle left his brother's door when he was met by a
messenger from the Intendant, who brought a note with a flourish.
La Salle looked at the vain messenger with inimical eyes&mdash;he
saw behind the insolent face the harsh face of his master.</p>

<p>He took the note, read it, and said: &ldquo;Go tell his honor
that I shall wait upon him presently&mdash;and go quickly,&rdquo;
he added, sharply, as he saw the man moving slowly away. The
messenger saw La Salle's stern eyes and gave haste to his
footsteps.</p>

<p>La Salle sought his lodgings first, and took there from papers
of Fort Frontenac and the West that he wished to show the
Intendant; then he went to the palace. On the way he met men he
knew and they saluted him, some mockingly, some in a half-friendly
way, and one or two in doubtful courtesy; but on the way he met
Barrois, the secretary of the Governor. He asked him to tell Count
Frontenac whither he was going. Barrois' eyes showed the faith he
had in La Salle, and a curious hard smile played at his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Intendant will try to overcome you&mdash;but at least
you will leave the palace safe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled. &ldquo;If I can deal with the master, I can, I
hope, deal with him. Colbert is his master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When La Salle entered the palace, he saw leaving by another door
Tuke Darois, and he said to himself, &ldquo;Here's what wants
heeding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the Intendant's office he was met with courtesy and sly
satire. &ldquo;Ah, M. de la Salle, we find you in Quebec again,
bringing reports of your doings in the West, I suppose. I wished to
see you before you went among your friends here. I ask you to give
up your work in the West. It comes to naught&mdash;to
naught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle shrugged a shoulder and said, bitingly: &ldquo;The
Governor wishes me to continue the work which the Grand Monarch
gave me to do. Shall I heed words against the commands of those
above you, Your Honor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never believed in your work, as you know, and your
late mishaps prove I am right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right! And so you detain my men come from France, and
seize my property and my furs, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Your</i> furs! The furs of the King whose laws you
break, you and the Governor. You have done illegal things, but, now
you have come, I shall release your men. I detained them, for they
are sons of France whose lives should be spared the fate awaiting
them with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle drew from his pocket a report. &ldquo;I have had this
made out for Your Honor. It gives my doings since I left Quebec
last. I shall leave it with you, for naught can be said till you
have all the facts. Those you receive from the Jesuit fathers are
not correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you then seen them&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen <i>them</i>, but I know the Jesuit
fathers, and all they say is tinctured by their hate of me. Perhaps
they do not mean to deceive, but they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are hard sayings. I have asked you here, Sieur de
la Salle, to make you an offer. I have long valued your ability and
zeal, and if you will abandon Fort Frontenac and the West I will
give you a post under myself here where you will win high place and
be a blessing to France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle grimly looked the Intendant in the eyes. &ldquo;If it
is to abandon the work given me by the King to do, you have grossly
mistaken me. No obstruction and no mishap prevents me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your <i>Griffon</i> was lost and nearly all else, and you
have no hope, no chance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have hope that in the end my name will live in the
story of Canada when yours may be forgotten save as my foe,&rdquo;
was the stern reply of La Salle. &ldquo;But I beg you to read my
report, and I will come again if you wish, Your Honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may not wish you to come again, but I will read your
report. Do you expect to get money in Quebec to put you on your
feet again? Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all in the hands of God, and so far God has been
with me,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, we shall see&mdash;we shall see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we shall see,&rdquo; was La Salle's response, and
there was that in the reply of the Intendant which La Salle did not
like. He recalled Tuke Darois at the door.</p>

<p>With all due courtesy La Salle left the Intendant and busied
himself in the city, trying to get money for his purposes&mdash;and
failing. He had seen old friends, and they all declined to help
him, and men to whom he owed money were unfriendly at first. Yet
the calm will of the man impressed them, and their anger became
less insistent as he talked. Somehow the bigness of his purposes
influenced them.</p>

<p>In the distance La Salle had seen Madame Ranard, and she was
more radiant than ever, and he had also seen going into her
father's office Lya Darois, buoyant and entrancing. His heart gave
a great leap for this was what came nearer to La Salle's inner life
than aught he had known. He did not wish to speak with her, and
though she knew he was in Quebec, she did not wish to speak with
him, she knew not why. She was perplexed, for her father was
strangely set in manner, and she felt it had to do with La Salle.
She knew he had been at the Intendant's palace, and she was now
going to his office to discover why, if possible. She was in a sore
position and it vexed her.</p>
<br>

<p>That night at ten o'clock, La Salle was going to his lodgings,
when he was met by two masked men who blocked his way and then set
upon him with swords. Two to one and a bright moon and a lonely
street. For five minutes they fought hard and La Salle knew he was
against men who used the sword skilfully. Behind them, not far,
were two other figures that came no nearer, but watched the fight.
At length La Salle knew that one of the men attacking him was Tuke
Darois. By a brilliant stroke he brought one of his foes to the
ground, and then he fought Tuke Darois. Now a small crowd began to
gather, and La Salle fought on. At last the mask dropped from the
face of Tuke Darois, and La Salle pressed him hard. This man must
die. He was a traitor, a spy and a rogue, and the truth must now be
known. At last he had his foe at his mercy, and with a sudden deft
stroke he struck him to the heart with the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spy of the Hudson's Bay Company&mdash;go!&rdquo; and
Darois fell with a cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spy of the Hudson's Bay Company!&rsquo; Was that
the work of Tuke Darois?&rdquo; The few people present murmured
these words, and they stared at the dead men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was set upon by two of them, and both are done
for.&rdquo; La Salle said.</p>

<p>At this moment a figure came forward. It was that of Duchesneau,
the Intendant. He knelt beside Darois. &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; he said
to the dying man. &ldquo;Is it true? Are you a Hudson's Bay Company
spy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darois raised himself slightly on his elbow. &ldquo;Yes, a
spy&mdash;God forgive,&rdquo; and he dropped back dead.</p>

<p>Duchesneau turned to La Salle. &ldquo;You have done good work
for France to-day, Sieur de la Salle. You have taken the life of a
foe of France. In France's name I thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet he was in your employ, Your Honor. You did not know,
but I suspected at Fort Frontenac, and I did not speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not speak&mdash;why?&rdquo; The Intendant's face was
disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good? I was far away. I thought you knew, and yet I
could not understand it. Had it happened in Quebec, I would have
exposed him, but the only one who knew the truth was his daughter,
who came to Fort Frontenac to warn me&mdash;he had not told her he
was going there&mdash;and she came back as a watch upon him. I
cannot tell how she came to know. Why he hated me I could not tell
at first, but when I guessed he was a spy of the Hudson's Bay
Company, I understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth must be told now,&rdquo; said the Intendant in
anxiety, for be had employed this man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quebec knows it at his death,&rdquo; said La Salle,
pointing to the few men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take up the bodies and bear them to their homes,&rdquo;
said the Intendant.</p>

<p>The bodies were lifted and carried slowly away, and La Salle
followed that of Darois to his home. The Intendant went heavily to
his palace and La Salle knocked at the door of Darois' house. The
old French servant came to the door, and behind her was Lya.</p>

<p>In the moonlight the picture was a grim one. Lya saw the body
and ran forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle, you have lost your father,&rdquo; said La
Salle. &ldquo;He with another attacked me and I killed him. To the
Intendant he said he was a spy, after I had accused him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl's face was set. &ldquo;The Intendant was
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I know who drove my father to attack you,
monsieur!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so do I, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring the body into the house,&rdquo; she said, and the
men laid it on a couch in a downstairs room.</p>

<p>She looked at La Salle with half-blinded eyes of misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You killed my father!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would have killed me. What else to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his eyes was the bitter truth that now and forever all was
over between them. He had killed her father, and while they lived
they could never be aught to each other save friends.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXIII</h3>

<h3>La Salle Sees Light</h3>

<p><strong>The</strong> next day all Quebec knew that La Salle had
been set upon by Tuke Darois and his friend, and had killed them
both. It showed that La Salle was an accomplished swordsman, and
the killing of a spy was published by Count Frontenac as patriotism
of which Canada could not be too grateful. No one supposed the
Intendant or the Ranards knew of his being a spy of the Hudson's
Bay Company. They did not, but they used the spy for their own dark
designs, and the Intendant set Darois and his friend on La Salle on
the suggestion of the Ranards, and Ranard was with the Intendant
when the attack took place.</p>

<p>On the night of the killing, Duchesneau, Ranard, and Madame
Ranard met at the palace, and Madame Ranard, with fierce anger,
said: &ldquo;That pest La Salle has skill with the sword given to
few, and now in the eyes of Canada he will be a bigger man than he
has ever been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He killed a spy&mdash;Darois was a spy of the Hudson's
Bay Company,&rdquo; said the Intendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know that when I engaged him,&rdquo; said
Ranard. &ldquo;It is the most damnable luck, and now La Salle will
return to his work with money and with glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe spoke. &ldquo;We shall do well to applaud meanwhile, and
you will make your statement about Darois at once, else folk will
say you hired a spy of the foes of New France!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His daughter&mdash;did she not know he was a spy?&rdquo;
asked Ranard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows? She is a pretty vixen, and she plays her part
well,&rdquo; said the Intendant. &ldquo;Somehow, I don't think she
knew the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe shrugged a shoulder. &ldquo;You are too gentle-minded,
Intendant. She is bad to her last inch, and so Quebec will believe.
She cannot live here now. No. The world will be against
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant nodded, yet after a moment said: &ldquo;But wait.
La Salle will say something. He knows why she followed her father
to Fort Frontenac. We must wait for La Salle to speak. He has a
dark spirit, but he is able.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he <i>knew</i>, and did not expose Darois at once, he
was as guilty as Darois,&rdquo; said Madame Ranard, keenly. Her
eyes lighted, her fingers twisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could not know unless the girl told him,&rdquo; said
the Intendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would not betray her father,&rdquo; was the alert
reply. &ldquo;She can have no home in Quebec. She should go to
prison, and you will do well to place her there,
Intendant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see how the wind blows,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;She has not yet spoken. Wait till Darois is
buried.&rdquo;</p>
<br>

<p>The day was bright and glowing, and the river, big and splendid,
seemed like a conscious spectator, for it gently rippled, as though
with laughter, and on its broad bosom Indian canoes and little
ships moved softly.</p>

<p>In the palace of Bishop Laval was a stern judge of events. La
Salle was not loved by the Bishop or by the Jesuits, but he had
done a fine piece of work. As for Darois, he did not deserve
Christian burial; he must be put in unconsecrated ground, with the
sparsest ceremonies. Also he must be buried that very day. None
could say no to Laval's decisions in such things. He sent his
chaplain to Darois' house, and gave orders for the body to be
placed at once in a coffin and buried before sunset.</p>

<p>When the chaplain arrived he found the undertaker there, and Lya
stood like one over whom there hung an ugly cloud. Her eyes were
sad, her face was drawn, yet it had sincerity and honesty. She
bowed her head to the order the chaplain brought, for she knew her
father had cruelly earned his disgrace.</p>

<p>The chaplain said to her: &ldquo;My daughter, have you naught to
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naught, but this&mdash;the Bishop must be obeyed. My
heart and conscience are clear before God. I have not sinned
against France or Canada. I am the friend of both, and my father
earned his wicked end. There is no more to say. For me there is no
future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chaplain was moved. His thin lips quivered slightly as he
said: &ldquo;Your future is in the hands of God, and He knows your
heart. Have no fear, the Church will be your friend. I will report
to Monsieur de Quebec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had gone, Lya said: &ldquo;The Church will be my friend!
No, never that. Death were easier than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not see La Salle until the burial came. He had been
received by his old friends in much applause, and the Governor had
sent word that he would have him dine that night at the
Ch&acirc;teau. Meanwhile La Salle raised the money he wished for
his purposes, and not at too high a rate of interest, and was ready
for his work in the West again. One man, the greatest merchant in
the city, Charles Le Moyne, who had gallant sons, D'Iberville,
Bienville, St. Helene, and Longueil, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have much against you, yet you always win&mdash;and
this last deed brings you close to all of us. What you need for
your work you can have&mdash;you have placed us all in your
debt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, it was that as the coffin of Darois was carried to his
grave, the only mourner was Lya; some of the population followed in
curiosity. With Lya was the old Frenchwoman who had brought her up.
She gave no thought to anyone else, but saw his coffin lowered,
with meager rites and scant formality, in unconsecrated ground. She
knew that while she lived she must bear her father's shame and must
ever suffer. Strangely enough, La Salle stood not far from the
grave when Darois was lowered, and her heart went out in gratitude.
He had killed her father, who had tried to ruin and kill him, yet
he came to see him put away so darkly, with many near who did not
grasp the spirit of his chivalry. He was bigger than any of them
knew, but the girl understood. He did not speak to her, and she
knew that feeling was high against her, but that did not shake her.
Besides, here was a true and honest friend, Luce Hontard, who knew
her life as no one else knew it and who would have given every drop
of blood in her fat body to shield this girl.</p>

<p>The priest said but one word to her when he had ended his brief
ceremony, and it was, &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could have said naught so comforting to her, and she turned
from the grave of dishonor with a heaving heart, but with a spirit
that would not be daunted. She would face whatever might be with
valor.</p>

<p>La Salle saw her go with pain and a sorrow that would be with
him while he lived, for he had sunk an everlasting chasm between
them. She left with head erect and body firm, but with woe dragging
her footsteps, and she knew that no one dared show her
kindness&mdash;yet.</p>

<p>That night at six o'clock La Salle sat at the Governor's table,
and the dinner served was delicate and plentiful. Frontenac had a
good cook and he had a gift for entertainment as for
administration. He raised his glass to La Salle soon after they
were seated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drink to my friend, Robert, Sieur de la Salle, and may
his work prosper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle drank with glowing eyes. &ldquo;All is well with me
now, Excellency, but is it so with all here? I have been loaned
money to-day, and I shall leave soon, for my work calls. But the
daughter of Tuke Darois is alone and disgraced and poor. What of
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac smiled: &ldquo;Think you I forget these things? I know
what the Intendant and others will try to do, but I have faith in
the girl. She is as straight as the candle and burns as pure a
flame. She shall not suffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle shook his head. &ldquo;She will have the Intendant and
the Jesuits against her, and they are powerful. She lives alone
with old Luce Hontard. I fear for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac laughed and his face showed a sense of triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose she came to live at this
Ch&acirc;teau!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle put down his knife and fork: &ldquo;Came&mdash;to live
here!&rdquo; he said, in dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not! Madame Louvigny, a cousin of mine, lives here
now, and she likes the girl and has ever done so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle could scarcely believe his ears. &ldquo;What will the
Intendant and the people of Quebec say&mdash;do you not see, Your
Excellency?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, but what difference can it make! The Intendant
would put the girl in prison if she did not live at the
Ch&acirc;teau; but he dare not arrest one who has the protection of
the Governor's house. Can you not see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Good God, how strange! To live here&mdash;But
suppose she will not come. Suppose she sees the danger of
it&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Danger&mdash;to whom?&rdquo; Frontenac gazed, surprised,
at La Salle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Danger to you, Excellency! If the Intendant reports the
fact to the King, or Colbert, how will it seem to them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if I report that the Intendant and Darois tried to
murder you, and that they used consciously a spy of the Hudson's
Bay Company, how would that strike the great men in France! Am I so
blind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle saw that Frontenac would strike ruthlessly at the
Intendant if need be. &ldquo;Excellency, you are bigger than any of
these folks and they cannot defeat you, and mademoiselle will be
safe from the Intendant. A proud position for a girl so badly born.
Even the people of Quebec cannot question what the Governor does,
when they know that the girl came to Fort Frontenac to circumvent
her father. She did not tell me this, but I guessed it, and so did
Tonty; and she prevented him in so far as she could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not wholly good,&rdquo; said the Governor,
&ldquo;but it cannot be helped, and she was not with him. People
will say she should have denounced him, but shall you ask a girl to
destroy her own father? The girl shall live here as a ward of mine,
and who shall fight me on the point? I am free from stain. I have
no axes to grind, save one, and we will, grind it together. While
we dine here, Madame Louvigny has gone to Tuke Darois home, and
before dinner is over we may know whether the girl will
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour passed and there came a soft knocking at the door.
Frontenac gave the order to enter, and Madame Louvigny came forward
smiling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have good news. The
girl consents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac and La Salle rose at her entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! good! Be seated, madame,&rdquo; said Frontenac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not yet. She would not at first listen to
me&mdash;save in thanks, but when I said it was for her own safety
and that she could not refuse the Governor, she said sadly, yet
proudly, she would come. Her tears of gratitude wet my hand. So she
came, and even as we left with old Luce Hontard, a soldier came
from M. Duchesneau to summon her to the palace. I said the
Intendant would find her at the Ch&acirc;teau, and she is
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here now at the, Ch&acirc;teau! That's as it should
be,&rdquo; exclaimed Frontenac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here now&mdash;Excellency&mdash;outside,&rdquo; said the
sweet-faced woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here now!&rdquo; said La Salle, and his heart gave a
leap, then seemed to stop beating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring her in, please,&rdquo; said Frontenac, and Madame
Louvigny vanished for a moment.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened again. Madame Louvigny entered, and
with her was Lya Darois, who stood with steadfast, wondering eyes,
looking at Frontenac.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXIV</h3>

<h3>Tonty and Mutiny</h3>

<p><strong>Tonty</strong> had been left to make good foothold in
the Illinois at Fort Cr&egrave;vecoeur. He had fifteen men, smiths,
ship carpenters, housewrights, and soldiers, with l'Esperance and
Friar Membr&eacute; and the gentle and devoted Father Gabriel de la
Rabourde. After work for some time on a new boat, Tonty went to
fortify a cliff not far away. The day after he had gone the men
mutinied&mdash;ten only remained faithful. They destroyed the fort,
stole all the lead, provisions, and furs, inscribed on the small
vessel &ldquo;<i>We are all savages</i>,&rdquo; and took to the
woods.</p>

<p>Thus in one day was the work of weeks destroyed, and La Salle
injured by those who served him. It was beautiful weather and the
spot was lovely, but the men were offscourings, and, with La Salle
and Tonty absent, gave themselves the freedom of pirates.</p>

<p>The opposition of the faithful ten nearly lost them their lives,
but they had courage and adroitness and escaped before the worst
was done and the mutineers had left. They made their way under
great hardship to Tonty, and the rebels completed their work of
destruction. That such things could be done is a sign of the vast
spirit of evil in a beautiful new world. These men shared no joys
of discovery or settlement; they saw naught save the hour in which
they lived, the food which they ate, the furs got by hunting. To
them life was daily toil and struggle, and ended with the day, but
they were capable of enthusiasm and great braveries.</p>

<p>Here was a fort at the start of the Mississippi adventure,
broken by those who helped to build it, here was the ship on which
they had labored inscribed with the cynical comment, &ldquo;<i>We
are all savages</i>.&rdquo; They were not far removed from the
primitive debauchery and cruelty of the Iroquois, but they had no
gifts of organization which made that body so successful. These men
had no Long House like the Iroquois&mdash;sometimes five hundred
feet long and containing many fires and great numbers of savages.
These Iroquois watched women prepare great kettles of food while
themselves played with cherry stones, games of chance, at times
bartering all they had, or made arrowheads, or smoked, or sat with
girls, making love in silence, or quarreled, or slept, or slapped
the bare bodies of children who crawled round.</p>

<p>Life in the Long House was like that of a university, where men
live in&mdash;the spirit of the tribe holds all, and one house
becomes a center of tribal spirit. The Long House was the most
powerful thing among the Iroquois, for, while there were
innumerable small quarrels, these were overcome by the general
tribal feeling. Looking through the Long House, one was conscious
of organized life in which dark things might be done, but all was
held by the strong circle of visible being.</p>

<p>It was like the court at Versailles&mdash;huge, with small
rooms, where all met. Union, concentration, were the pervading
influences. Louis lived an open life like the chief in the Long
House. There was little privacy at Versailles; there was little
privacy at the Long House, but in France it turned a series of
duchies into a great kingdom, and it was as successful as with the
Iroquois. Versailles was more than a palace, it was a nation. In it
the nobles were under the eye of the King, and if he said of those
he never saw, &ldquo;I do not know them,&rdquo; their life was
over. It was France concentrated.</p>

<p>In Canada two Systems were working, and the one bound to last
was struggling for life. History says which was greater, Frontenac
or those who opposed him, La Salle or his foes. This was the
period, more than at any other, when the fate of Canada was in the
scales. With the discovery of the Mississippi to its mouth, with
the establishment of Louisiana, was to come the building of an
empire. And this period after La Salle had triumphed at Quebec was
the most acute in his whole history and in that of Canada.</p>

<p>When word came to Tonty of the mutiny he sent four men, two by
one route and two by another, to find La Salle. Boisrondet and
l'Esperance, a youth called Renault, and one hired man, and the
friars remained with him. They lodged in the empty town of the
Illinois until the spring, when thousands of natives returned and
life became perilous. The Iroquois had started strife between the
Miamis and the Illinois. All summer Tonty waited, and La Salle did
not come. At last after vain efforts to convert the Illinois, the
two friars withdrew to a lodge a league away, and the remaining
Frenchmen did what they could to pass away the time.</p>

<p>At last a Shawanoe Indian, who had been visiting and was
returning home, reappeared and gave word that the Iroquois army was
near. There was immediate excitement and natives threatened Tonty.
They threw into the river the tools of the French, greased their
bodies, painted their faces, befeathered their heads, and shook
their hatchets to work up their courage. With morning came the
Iroquois. They were over five hundred with one hundred Miamis.</p>

<p>It was a strange sight, tall, naked warriors, some in buffalo
robes, some with shirts of deerskins fringed with dyed porcupine
quills, with clubs and quivers with stone-headed arrows. Some were
armed with guns, pistols, and swords; others had bucklers of wood
or rawhide and wore corselets of rough twigs. The scouts declared
they had seen a Jesuit among the Iroquois, and it would seem that
the French and the Iroquois were working together. Tonty's life
hung by a hair, but when he said he and his men would fight the
Iroquois the danger lessened.</p>

<p>The fight began and Tonty saw it would all end in disaster, so
with the assent of the Illinois he would mediate. He took a wampum
belt and holding it up walked forward to meet the savage multitude.
Soon he was in the midst of the furious warriors and the guns of
the Iroquois were still firing. It was an odious sight&mdash;the
writhing bodies, the fiendish yells, every passion of an Indian war
at work. Tonty was dressed half savagely, and a young Indian
stabbed him, but the blade struck a rib, and then a chief said he
was a Frenchman, for his ears were not pierced! The wounded Tonty
told them the Illinois were twelve hundred and that there were
sixty Frenchmen to help them. So, at last they let Tonty go back
with a flag of truce. Then the Illinois sent a young Indian with
Tonty, but this youth nearly proved the ruin of the negotiation,
for he betrayed the weakness in number of the Illinois. Tonty,
however, by skill, address, and coolness, was able to complete the
treaty. But the Iroquois grew hourly more jealous of Tonty and
would have killed him, but it was not their policy to fight the
French at the moment. At last they called a council, and Tonty and
Membr&eacute; were bidden to it. With six packs of beaver skins, it
was made clear that the Illinois should not be fought; then came
plaster to heal Tonty's wound, and sunflower oil to anoint him; and
they would strike camp and go home. All seemed well. But now some
of the Iroquois shouted they would eat Illinois flesh before they
went home!</p>

<p>Then Tonty at once kicked away the pledges in rejection and the
chiefs, in rage, drove them from the lodge. In the morning, after a
night of alarm, they left, followed by the curses of the Iroquois.
They went in a leaky canoe and paddled about five leagues, then
landed to dry their baggage and repair their canoe, and the noble
Father Rabourde landed and wandered across the meadows with his
breviary. He never returned. He was captured by Indians and
scalped; and so another son of a great Burgundian house gave his
life for his cause in an age of vice and virtue and chivalry.</p>

<p>In the Illinois town dreadful things were seen. The fury of the
Iroquois was spent upon the dead. They ravaged the graveyards,
burned and threw bodies to the dogs, placed skulls on stakes as
trophies, and some of the hideous remains they ate. Then, later,
when the Illinois broke up into their several tribes, the Tamaroas
remaining near the mouth of the Illinois were assailed. The men
fled, but seven hundred women and children were captured, and
revolting torture and lust took place. At length they passed with
hosts of captives, triumphing over women, children, and the
dead.</p>

<p>Tonty and his men went on and gathered acorns and roots for
food. They lacked ammunition and Boisrondet melted a pewter dish
for musket balls, and they made moccasins of the leather mantle of
Father Rabourde. They abandoned their canoe and set out on foot for
Lake Michigan. The cold was intense, and they grubbed up wild
onions from the frozen ground to prevent starvation. They reached
the bay and patched up an old canoe, but again they had to leave it
in a great storm. Etienne Renault was taken ill from eating a piece
of an Indian rawhide shield. And this was their salvation, for the
next day a party of Kickapoo Indians came upon them. These they
welcomed how gladly! After this they passed through matted forests
where the squirrels chattered. At night, after passing far-reaching
sheets of water and grassy heights and crags, they smoked pipes by
the fire and slept at peace beneath the stars. They were carried at
last to an Indian village of the Pottawattamies, who were under a
chief friendly to La Salle. They were given to eat, in birch-bark
dishes, wild rice with dried whortle-berries.</p>

<p>Here there was naught to do but wait for the coming of La Salle.
Tonty was sure La Salle would at last find them. Among the Kickapoo
Indians they were safe and at peace, but Tonty kept the men
building huts and making moccasins and mantles. The Indians came
and went, and they sang their native monotonous chants and more
than once arranged a war dance in which the latent furies of
primeval life had play&mdash;tattooed and painted and feathered,
and pagan in their gesture's and language as they were. They also
had other dances, and these they did with a curious fantastic
grace, and even their squaws and girls were permitted to join
them&mdash;the women almost naked, oiled, and rankly
perfumed&mdash;in their grotesque gyrations.</p>

<p>Then they asked the Frenchmen to sing to them, and this they did
with consummate point, for the squaws shook with laughter and the
girls hung their heads or peeped through their fingers. This was
one of the songs:</p>

<div class="verse">

</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>This song was sung in their own language in a translation made
by Boisrondet and it was most popular, for life among these Indians
was free and vicious, and they well knew what the song meant. Even
the young girls made suggestive motions and the eyes of the older
ones glowed viciously. So the weeks wore on, and again at a catch
of fish in the lake, this song the explorers sang to the assembled
Indians to applause:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;In the water the fish frisks

<span class="line6">Ladera?<br></span> <span class="line0">In the

<span class="line6">Ladera!<br></span> <span class="line0">You the
young girl,<br></span> <span class="line2">They will love
you!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>By such primitive ways with friendly Indians they held their own
and waited for La Salle. Their food was plentiful of its kind and
there were plantations of beans and corn for which they paid by
presents of knives, hatchets, sweetmeats, and crude utensils, but
ever there was the danger of hostile Indian attack. It was a cold
and raw region, but when the sun shone it gave their spirits
impulse, and there was sun in plenty now and rain but seldom. Tonty
was most successful with Indians, and while he was impatient he had
a feeling that all would be better when La Salle arrived.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXV</h3>

<h3>The Light from the Ruins</h3>

<p><strong>When</strong> La Salle left Quebec after killing Darois
and getting money from those who had before refused him, he went
again to Fort Frontenac where La Forest was in charge, and, taking
a surgeon, ship carpenters, joiners, masons, soldiers, voyageurs,
and laborers&mdash;twenty-five in all&mdash;needed for the outfit
of a vessel, he at length reached Michillimackinac, and was again
faced by hostility. He went forward with six Frenchmen and an
Indian. If the Iroquois had invaded the land of the Illinois it
would be ill. In all his travels he had met with discouragement,
but difficulty only braved his spirit. When at last he made the
journey all was lonely, now all was life to the full. The plains
were alive with buffalo, and they killed buffalo and deer, geese
and swans. They cut the meat into flakes and dried it. The men were
in good fettle and they looked forward to seeing Tonty. They passed
the cliff called the Rock of St. Louis where Tonty had been ordered
to build his stronghold, but it had no signs of life. No work had
been done on it. They gazed on a scene of desolation&mdash;ashes,
charred poles, human skulls, wolves, crows and buzzards, open
graves, bones, mangled corpses. The contents of the
caches&mdash;store of corn&mdash;were scattered and cornfields
burned.</p>

<p>As La Salle gazed on the terrible scene, a vast comet appeared.
It was the largest and most lurid in recorded history and came
nearer to the earth than any other. Many believed it a portent
against the earth, but not La Salle; it had for him only scientific
interest. For days he watched it and marveled at the excitement of
the Frenchmen and the Indians. To him, if aught, it was a beacon to
march forward.</p>

<p>There was an abandoned camp of the Iroquois. One hundred and
thirteen huts stood in the meadow, and the trees were covered with
their insignia, and marks of Illinois killed or captured, but none
showing that Frenchmen had been slain. At last they came to Fort
St. Louis and found it a ruin and a hideous scene, and with horror
La Salle and his men descended the broad current and at length
reached the Mississippi, the lode-star of his dreams and hopes.</p>

<p>Who can say what were his feelings then? The blazing comet was
only a token of better days to come. It awoke in his firm breast a
deeper faith than he had ever known. It was the sign from Heaven
that all would be well with his schemes. The glowing sky above was
the glamour of his dreams come true. He raised his head, and
invoked it with the persistent faith of the zealot and the pioneer.
It was like a hand beckoning him. Then they turned back toward Lake
Michigan to find Tonty.</p>

<p>Hardships followed. Snow fell in vast quantities for nearly
three weeks, and through forty leagues of open country they fought
their way. Furious winds blew, and the snow was so light they could
not wear their snowshoes, so La Salle went ahead, pushing his way
through drifts, and at length they reached Fort Miami, but no news
had come of Tonty, and all they could do was to wait.</p>

<p>He spent the winter at Fort Miami by the borders of Lake
Michigan. He knew his foes in Quebec city had leagued with the
Iroquois, and he planned to bring together the tribes of the West
and colonize them at this fort in the valley of the Illinois. There
were friends and allies near&mdash;refugees from Virginia and
Maine, Abenakis and Mohegans&mdash;they were of a hero-worshiping
clan. Also Ouiatenons, Kickapoos, Mascoutins, Kilaticas. These
swore to follow him, no matter what the perils or hardships. Then
came new allies&mdash;Shawanoes from the valley of the Ohio, and La
Salle urged them to come also, and planned to negotiate with the
Miamis and the Illinois, for the Iroquois had murdered a band of
Miamis and had intrenched themselves in rush forts in the Miami
country.</p>

<p>La Salle set out to negotiate, and reached the prairies where at
a camp of Outagamis, he got news that Tonty was with the
Pottawattamies. This news made La Salle's heart sing. He met bands
of Illinois whom he placated and won, and then he went to the
Miamis. Three Iroquois warriors had been among these traducing the
explorer, but La Salle confronted them and said they dared not
repeat in his presence what they had said behind his back. They
were silent and confounded, and secretly left the town in the
night.</p>

<p>At last at Michillimackinac La Salle found Tonty and told tales
of disaster, and listened to tales of woe that would have overcome
lesser men, but they were not of the lesser kind, and they paddled
their canoes for a thousand miles south. At last La Salle
determined to lead his men to the mouth of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>So they started in fine weather and with cheerful hearts. They
passed through a wonderful country where was now plenty of game,
and Nika, ever silent and watchful, was busy directing the skinning
and drying of the flesh of deer and buffalo, and all seemed going
well.</p>

<p>One day as the canoes went swiftly, there came a song from a
canoe which was at last taken up by them all, and it floated over
the shining waters:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;My father married me to<br></span>
<span class="line2">Petite Jeannete, glon, glon,<br></span>
<span class="line0">And knowing nothing except<br></span>
<span class="line2">To guard the house,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">To the sound of the bigournoise<br></span> <span class=
"line2">Sound of nuts and apples,<br></span> <span class="line0">Of
figs and strawberries,<br></span> <span class="line2">These are the
steps of la glon, glon, glon,<br></span> <span class="line0">Gloria
de la ladereta,<br></span> <span class="line0">De la bigournoise, o
gai,<br></span> <span class="line2">L'espoir, c'est de la
bigournoise.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>It was a happy and exciting song, and La Salle and Tonty
listened, and Tonty joined in it. La Salle's lips murmured with the
rest, and he waved a hand towards the south:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is there&mdash;I know all is coming now,
Tonty&mdash;to the sound of the bigournoise. I hear the steps of la
glon, glon, glon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed softly, and Tonty nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hope, it is bigournoise,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The days went on.</p>

<p>So it was that at last with a hundred Shawanoes and others, and
thirty Frenchmen, with Tonty he drew up his canoes on the
shore.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXVI</h3>

<h3>A Visitor from France</h3>

<p><strong>Soon</strong> after La Salle left Quebec there arrived
his cousin, Fran&ccedil;ois Plet, whom he had asked to come. He had
high character and much vigor, middle aged, strong, and reliable, a
brain not easily turned, and a patriot. He had lent La Salle money
when in France, no one had yet done so, and his confident faith
brought other sums to La Salle. La Salle had, in truth, no head for
commercial enterprises, and in a letter written to one of his
creditors he begs his correspondent to send out an agent of his
own:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He need not be very <i>savant</i>, but he must be
faithful, patient of labor, and fond neither of gambling nor women,
nor good cheer, for he will find none of these things with
me.&rdquo; He further adds, &ldquo;I have neither the habit nor the
inclination to keep books, nor have I anybody with me who knows
how.&rdquo; Elsewhere he says:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>The twenty-two men who deserted and robbed me are not to be
believed on their word, deserters and thieves as they are. . . . It
needs as unjust a judge as the Intendant to prompt such rascals to
enter complaint against a person to whom he had given a warrant to
arrest them. . . Those who remain with me are the first I had, and
they have been with me for six years. . . . I do not know what you
mean by having popular manners. There is nothing special in my food
or clothing, which are all the same for me and my men. . . . You do
not know the men one must employ out here, when you exhort me to
make merry with them. They are incapable of that, for they are
never pleased unless we give free rein to their drunkenness and
debauchery and other vices. If that is what you call unpopular
manners, neither honor nor inclination would let me stoop to gain
their favor in a way so disreputable; and besides, the consequence
would he dangerous, and they would have the same contempt for me
that they have for all who treat them in this fashion. . . . As for
what you say about my looks and manner, I confess that you are not
far from right. But <i>naturem espellas</i> and if I am wanting in
impassiveness and show of feeling towards those with whom I
associate, <i>it is only through a timidity which is natural to me,
and which has made me leave various employments where without it I
could have succeeded</i> . . . . Abb&eacute; Renaudot knows with
what repugnance I had the honor to appear before Monseigneur de
Conti, and sometimes it takes me a week to make up my mind to go to
an audience. . . . It is a defect of which I shall never rid myself
as long as I live, often as it spites me against myself, and often
as I quarrel with myself about it.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>This was La Salle's picture of himself, and it explained some of
his failures, for his mind was shadowed by great timidity. He could
inspire respect always, but only those who came near him loved him,
yet he could influence men high and low, from the accomplished
Louis himself, and Colbert and Seignelay to the poorest Indian in
the West. The note in his life counting most was character, and
that he had in unmatched degree. Self-concentration gave him
powerful steadiness, and he kept his head up where most men would
fail. He was first in any hard work with his men; he marched at
their head; he took the worst of the blows; and he stands a
magnificent figure in the early history of the land he did so much
to create. Like all great men, he could get nearer to the primitive
mind than most others; he could sway Indians where none but
Frontenac could do so.</p>

<p>When Fran&ccedil;ois Plet came to Canada he was at once received
by Frontenac at dinner, and said he had come at La Salle's request
to take charge of trade at Fort Frontenac. To this Frontenac
replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your cousin I have always upheld, for he is the true
pioneer and explorer, but he has, alas! small gifts for
merchanting. He has made money enough to pay all his debts over and
over again, but he has not the great trader's caution, and he has
had bad luck&mdash;heavy losses with boats and furs. He has
powerful foes, but he will succeed. He has the soul and the face of
a majestic dreamer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Plet inclined his head. &ldquo;Excellency, he
not only dreams, he acts, and his acts approved by Count Frontenac
shall be upheld by the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac smiled, then laughed outright: &ldquo;I saw what was
in him from the first, and so did his foes. He has won his way in
spite of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he told of Darois and his daughter and the plot, and how La
Salle killed both men, and had gone West with fresh loans got by
his killing of a Hudson's Bay Company spy.</p>

<p>At that moment Barrois, the secretary, came with a letter,
giving it to Plet, who opened it and presently said to Barrois:
&ldquo;Say that I will go to the palace within the hour, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added to Frontenac: &ldquo;It is from the Intendant. He
wishes to see me. It was taken to my lodgings and brought on to me
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac nodded. &ldquo;He will try to influence you. He has a
gift of tongue, but he is too clever. He is the foe of La
Salle.&rdquo;</p>
<br>

<p>At the Intendant's palace there was a party and guests were
dancing and playing cards. Among them were new arrivals from France
who had come in the same ship as Fran&ccedil;ois Plet, and they
were mixing with local guests, flaunting their ribbons and laces as
though they owned New France.</p>

<p>The whole atmosphere was different from that of the
Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis. It was more frivolous and buoyant; it had
an air of garish splendor, a kind of gayety in keeping with the
gorgeous candelabra that hung from the ceiling. It was vivacious
and gay in a vicious sort, and because of that was dangerous. Here
the pleasure-loving folk came, and here was bred the spirit which
had made Madame Ranard the mistress of the Intendant&mdash;it was
the air of the place. Here men and women played with the sobor
realities of life, and gave cause for anxiety to the Bishop and the
priests. In shadowed corners could be seen careless triflers
caressing each other, and girls receiving gifts of jewelry as was
the custom of the time. No girl was ashamed to receive gifts, for
what was done at Versailles could be done in Quebec, and yet there
was little grave immorality in the city, for girls married so young
and there were fewer maids than men. It all had not the splendor of
furniture, paintings, and sculpture of Versailles, but there was
light and decoration and good music, and influence deadly to
perfect civil life.</p>

<p>At one card table sat Rojet Ranard and a seigneur and two
ladies; they were playing at high stakes with happy turmoil. When
Fran&ccedil;ois Plet passed through the room, Ranard whispered to
the seigneur and watched him till he disappeared. The eyes of many
followed Plet, for all knew him as a cousin of La Salle. They had
heard this after the ship, the <i>Carcassone</i>, arrived, and yet
few had seen him until now. His name passed from lip to lip, and
heads nodded, for they guessed what the Intendant meant to do, and
a very few of them hoped that Plet would remain true to La
Salle.</p>

<p>A moment later Fran&ccedil;ois Plet entered the Intendant's
room, and Duchesneau came forward from the table, laying down a pen
as though he had been at work. He shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur Plet, I welcome you to Quebec. I only knew
of your arrival just before I wrote. You have come, monsieur, to do
business at Fort Frontenac for the intrepid La Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to take charge of Fort Frontenac, and trade
in his name for a time. He is as just a man as belongs to
France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has reputation for fairness and honesty, and yet he
has not succeeded. He cannot succeed unless I hold out a hand to
help, for he has no business instinct. I would not lend him
money&mdash;no&mdash;for the chance of getting it back is
small.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own view is the chance is excellent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent? Excellent? Is that why you are
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is why. Nothing will be lost by any who loans to La
Salle. He may not have great gifts for making money, but none has
yet lost by him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because I have given him my support, for I am
head of finance and the law in this province.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot think your support is so great as that of Count
Frontenac, the Governor, who is over you and is head of
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count Frontenac is not over me in aught,&rdquo; said the
Intendant, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Your Honor, yours is the mechanism, but his
the policy. Working together, you can do much&mdash;apart, his
policy counts&mdash;he can do all needed to make this land worthy
of its origin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Plet had touched the Intendant on the raw, and had done
it purposely. He hit hard when he hit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not the turn of it all, monsieur. The late
Intendant Talon built this palace as a brewery, and he had policy
of commercial development which did Canada great good. He
controlled commerce, shipping, and the policy of trade. He built
great industries&mdash;he taught trades&mdash;he explored the
West&mdash;through him the Mississippi was discovered&mdash;and he
even opened up trade with the West Indies. It was more than
mechanism, it was policy, and I, and not Frontenac, am responsible
for the commercial welfare of the province. In my field I am
supreme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. I see. But you and Count Frontenac work together,
then, and you both would advance La Salle's interests. That is
great news. I had heard that Frontenac had ever been with my
cousin, and you when it pleased you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never been with him as Count Frontenac has
been&mdash;never, for his plans would not bear faithful
scrutiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the King's plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant bristled. &ldquo;Not the King's plans! They are
his own, and the King assented to them, because he did not fully
understand them, but he is doing so now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honor keeps the King and his Minister informed, of
course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As is my duty. I am a friend of La Salle, but he will not
succeed in the end; he has too much against him&mdash;the Church,
the merchants, and the spirit of the community. We all believe in
trade, but are not with him in his methods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are one in policy, but opposed in
administration&mdash;is that it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is it. If there is too much settlement in the West
and South, the difficulties of government are increased. Do you
see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet the King gave La Salle right to trade in the farther
West, and to build forts and so on. I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Plet looked dumfounded, but he was a good actor, and he
knew he was in the presence of one who was a great comedian&mdash;a
tragic comedian. Now that he had got the true measure of the man,
he played with one object only&mdash;to protect La Salle's
interests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The King was at Versailles and La Salle was there. Had I
been there, the King would not, I think, have given La Salle so
many concessions. It was a grevious error.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now that La Salle is in the work, you would not have
him withdraw yet&mdash;not immediately, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is it&mdash;I would have him withdraw, but not at
once. I hope you will get what is due you at Fort
Frontenac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of your approval. I am not going for myself
only, but for all of La Salle's creditors. I will only take my fair
share. That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant was astounded. Here was a really honest man, who
would work for others as well as for himself! If he could work with
this man he might himself get profit out of La Salle. With
enthusiasm he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the kind of man Canada needs. Can you and I not
work together&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Plet was in a quandary. He could not work with
Frontenac and this man also, and yet he wished to save La Salle
from attack. So he said, calmly: &ldquo;I told Count Frontenac I
would work for La Salle, with his support, and I will gladly work
for La Salle with Your Honor's support. We all shall be working for
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite, for the Governor approves of La Salle's
methods, and I do not. Yet that we should work in harmony for a
while is good. Change of method, that is the thing, and when you
get to Fort Frontenac you will see what I mean. I will send a man
with you. You will need help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honor, do not send your man till I give you word I
would like to start the work alone. When I have mastered the
present methods of trade I will send for your man, if I
may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In agitation well hidden the Intendant bowed his head &ldquo;It
shall be as you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they left the library and passed into the great ball-room.
It was all revelry and gayety, and through clouds of tobacco smoke
could be seen dancers holding each other close, and eyes of sensual
heat looking over broad shoulders, while loose folds of linen
showed breasts beating with the excitement of the hour. Behind her
husband, who had been losing heavily, stood Barbe Ranard. She was
brilliant with color and she dropped a curtsy as the Intendant with
Monsieur Plet appeared. Plet observed her closely. At the door of
the salon the Intendant said good-by to him.</p>

<p>As Piet left the palace he shook his head. &ldquo;An able and a
dangerous man. This fight demands every atom of resource. He tried
to win me, and to perdition with him! That woman, Ranard, is the
devil's own dam. She has gifts and a soul of shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he walked on alone the wonderful air crept into his bones.
The moonlight was like a silver fire, the stars like tender far-off
friends, the St. Lawrence a broad path of radiance, the Laurentian
Hills the coverts of great souls, the home of everlasting hopes,
the place where men could go to hide their failures or recall their
glories. They belonged to the everlasting history of the
seventeenth century. His eyes lighted.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXVII</h3>

<h3>The End of the Day</h3>

<p><strong>In</strong> the black days of late November, La Salle,
Tonty, and D'Autray, and Abenakis and Mohegan allies&mdash;eighteen
in all, with wives of ten Indians who La Salle did not wish to
take, and twenty-three Frenchmen, among whom were Friar
Membr&eacute; and Pierre Prudhomme&mdash;making fifty-four
altogether&mdash;started from Fort St. Louis for the Mississippi.
La Salle had abandoned building a vessel, and they made the journey
in canoes. Yet with canoes he could not carry enough furs and
produce to repay his creditors.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the journey Tonty said to him: &ldquo;It is
in my bones that this time you will succeed. I am only sorry we
have not a ship. It would impress the natives, it would carry furs
and goods&mdash;but to impress the natives is the chief
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle replied: &ldquo;You are right, but I cannot wait to
build a vessel. My needs are urgent. To find the mouth of the
Mississippi will be the reply to my foes and it will secure me with
my creditors. Even Count Frontenac could not see ahead at first. He
is powerful, but he cannot do all, he can only help when I have
opened up the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty nodded. &ldquo;Next to news of the money, what you told me
about Lya Darois was the best you brought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle saw the gleam in Tonty's eye, and it pleased him, for
between himself and the girl was now an impassable barrier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a true friend of this great land. She can make all
believe in her that do not wish to hurt her. At the Ch&acirc;teau
St. Louis she is safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this courageous act of Frontenac may make feeling
against him at Versailles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle shook his head somberly. &ldquo;I thought of that, but
it would need much more to influence King Louis. They are big men
and Frontenac's wife is a good agent. He is better served by his
wife than if she were here. She is more powerful because she does
not go to court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty smiled. &ldquo;It is said that Louis was once in love with
Madame la Comtesse, and it may be so. But women do not influence
him. He makes up his own mind. He has broken the power of the
nobles and built up that of the middle class, and his generals,
Cond&eacute;, Turenne, Vauban, Villars, and Luxembourg are masters
of war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle nodded. &ldquo;He sees for himself and he works like a
slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed softly. Then he grasped Tonty
by the arm. &ldquo;We are not old friends, Tonty, as time goes, but
we come nearer than do those I have known all my life. Time is not
all. I seem to have known you always, and I never feel shy in
talking to you&mdash;yes, I am a shy man, Tonty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty smiled. &ldquo;You are a combination of shyness and
bigness&mdash;as big as any man this land has known, and as shy as
a child&mdash;Goliath and Garonne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle laughed again. &ldquo;Certainly not David and
Delilah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was thinking of Barbe Ranard. Then he pointed towards the
Gulf of Mexico. &ldquo;My goal! There must be no delay. Yonder is
my land of promise. I see the reward of all our toil and misery.
Ours is the biggest enterprise this land has known. I have no fear
now, whatever lies between.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood in silence and looked towards the south. To both came
happy prescience and melancholy. Their bodies were tense, their
eyes were alight, but their faces had a strange pensiveness. Long
afterwards, when strange things happened, Tonty remembered it.</p>

<p>They moved on down the Illinois, and at last in February came to
the dark and tumbling waters of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>They built camp fires in the forest on the banks, and next
morning, after singing hymns and a &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; and
listening to the words of Friar Membr&eacute;, they set canoes
again on the muddy rushing stream, and further on found a deserted
town of the Tamaroas. Then a fortnight later they came upon three
Chickasaw towns. Here Pierre Prudhomme, one of the company, was
lost, and for days they hunted him without avail, but at last
Prudhomme appeared, to their great joy. La Salle hastily built a
fort here and called it Fort Prudhomme.</p>

<p>Three weeks later they found themselves in a thick fog. When it
cleared they saw Indians on the far bank of the river. The Indians
were excited, but La Salle sent a Frenchman with a calumet
decorated with ribbons to meet them. They all were warmly welcomed
to the town of Kappa of the Arkansas Indians, who were of great
civility and handsomeness. La Salle and his company had heard the
throb of the war drum and the sounds of an Indian war dance, but
that was because the Indians did not know the purpose of these
strangers. Dances and functions were held; La Salle, Tonty, and
their followers marched to the center of the town, a hymn was sung,
<i>Vive le Roi!</i> was shouted, and La Salle in Louis' name took
possession of the country. La Salle drew from the chief fealty to
Louis, and a gayer, kinder, more companionable lot of Indians La
Salle had never seen. When they left it was with cheers of good
will following them.</p>

<p>As they rowed down the river, moving swiftly, one of the
company, a Frenchman, who had been a cook in France, started a kind
of chanson doggerel, making it up as they went on, and his friends
joined in with him, and the river rang with it:</p>

<div class="verse">

<!--end of verse-->

<p>La Salle in the same canoe as Tonty said: &ldquo;That's the
spirit, my friend. In France he was a slave, and here he is free.
In France it was <i>H&eacute;las!</i> <i>H&eacute;las!</i> Here it
is tra la, tra la!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty nodded: &ldquo;They feel success at last in their bones.
How could it be otherwise in this sweet, smooth air, in this
exquisite land. Yet though the air is soft it stings with life!
Even the Indians hereabouts are quieter, more civilized. Those we
have just visited are the finest we have seen. They have better
homes, better food, and they have a religion that lifts them
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle nodded. &ldquo;None of the Indians of Canada are as far
advanced as these. These&rdquo;&mdash;he motioned
backwards&mdash;&ldquo;are a progressive people and this is a
beautiful land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were floating down through lovely prairie where game was in
plenty and birds innumerable sang, and flowers bloomed in
profusion. Even a snake ten feet long hanging from the branch of a
tree on the bank seemed out of place. La Salle nodded towards the
reptile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet everywhere the tongue of evil shows. There's a Jesuit
even here Tonty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty laughed. &ldquo;But its head hangs down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet if you were beneath it and it&mdash; See!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The snake dropped from the tree, a loathsome, wriggling
thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is not a Jesuit,&rdquo; said La Salle. &ldquo;No
Jesuit is ugly. He is as taking as he is deadly, and he is a
blessing, not a curse&mdash;save to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About three hundred miles below the town of the Arkansas, they
stopped by the edge of a swamp. Here, as their two guides told
them, was a path that led to the great town of the Taensas. Tonty
and Membr&eacute; and others were sent to visit it. Their men
shouldered the birch canoe through the swamp and launched it on a
lake which had once been of the channel of the river. At length
they reached the town, and Tonty had seen naught like
it&mdash;large square brick buildings with dome-shaped roofs. Two
of them were very large. One was the home of the chief and the
other was a Temple or House of the Sun.</p>

<p>Tonty and Membr&eacute; visited this Chief. His tribe was the
Taensas, and they were affable, distinguished in bearing, and
hospitable. They were received in the Chief's lodge. The Chief was
seated with three of his wives at his side, and sixty old men in
white cloaks of mulberry bark made his court. He received their
gifts, treated them with high honor, and addressed them
graciously.</p>

<p>Tonty made brief reply, for he wished La Salle to speak to them
and he said so. His master would presently pay his
respects&mdash;he was a friend of the King of France, the greatest
country in the world. In numbers it had fifty times the population
of the whole American continent, and had vast cities, while this of
the Taensas, though grand, was but the head of a pin to a kettle;
and yet this was the finest native town, and the people the most
advanced he or his friends had seen.</p>

<p>Then Tonty and Membr&eacute; went to visit the Temple, where
were kept the bones of dead chiefs, and it was built like the royal
lodge. The inside was crude, yet there was a sort of altar in the
center, and before it burned a fire that never died, and two old
men always watched it. The place was full of smoke and there were
dark, forbidden recesses. They held the riches of this
people&mdash;pearls from the Gulf and other jewels.</p>

<p>At the entrance were three wooden eagles faced towards the east,
and a mud wall with stakes on which were hung skulls of foes
sacrificed to the sun, and at the door was a block of wood in a
shell decorated with the hair of the victims. It was impressive and
powerful.</p>

<p>The next day the Chief came to La Salle's camp at the
river-side, in great pomp for a native. He was preceded by a master
of ceremonies and six attendants to clear the path for him, and
carried an awning to shield him from the sun. He was clothed in a
white robe, preceded by two men with fans of white plumes, and a
third carried before him two plates of bright copper.</p>

<p>Then ensued a scene of beauty and friendliness. La Salle spoke
eloquently, and the Chief with great dignity and force replied, and
concluded by saying: &ldquo;We give you our hearts and our love. We
bury the hatchet of war. We are brothers. We are at peace.&rdquo;
They all feasted and La Salle gave presents, and they embraced at
last and said farewell.</p>

<p>Then La Salle and his people visited the Coroas, were threatened
by the Quinipissas, a troublesome tribe of these south lands behind
the canebrakes, found the village of Tangibao, and three lodges
filled with corpses&mdash;a sack of their foes a few days
before.</p>

<p>Moving on, happy that there had been no bloodshed, La Salle
looked back at the country they had visited, from which they had
only kindness in spite of the gloomy predictions of the Illinois,
the Miamis, and the Iroquois, and his heart swelled with pride. The
brine of the sea came to his nostrils, and his eyes shone. They
were in a land all sun and warmth, all goodness to the sense a land
like none they had ever seen&mdash;glorious in its softness and
fertility. His heart swelled within him. He stretched out a hand,
looking back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come from darkness to light; I have beaten the
evil thing; I am content. God is with us.&rdquo; He made the sign
of the cross. &ldquo;Thanks be to Him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in April they came upon three broad channels. La Salle
took one, Tonty another, and D'Autray a third. As they drifted down
between the low marshy shores, the brackish water changed to brine.
Then at last came the broad bosom of the Gulf, and La Salle saw for
the first time the waters destined to be the center of tragedy and
the source of sorrow and happiness and immortality. On its restless
surface was shown the strife of the undercurrents, which were to
destroy not the dreams of his life but the value of his great
discovery to France for the moment. They had come a journey which
could be made from the Atlantic Ocean up the St. Lawrence to the
Great Lakes and the Illinois and the Mississippi to the Southern
Sea&mdash;a journey of thousands of miles&mdash;and all by canoe!
It was marvelous, and at last La Salle and Tonty and the rest met
on a spot of dry ground not far from the mouth of the river. There
they erected a column bearing the arms of France and inscribed:</p>

<p>Louis the Great, King of France and of Navarre, Reigns:<br>
the Ninth of April, 1682.</p>

<p>Under arms the Frenchmen stood, the Indians looked on in
silence. They chanted now the &ldquo;Te Deum,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Exaudiat,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Domine salvum fac
Regem.&rdquo; Then came volleys of musketry, shouts of &ldquo;Live
the King!&rdquo; and La Salle, standing near the column, read in a
loud voice the proclamation naming the new country Louisiana, and
taking in all the nations, peoples, provinces, cities, towns,
villages, mines, minerals, fisheries, streams. The territory should
extend from the mouth of the Ohio along the Mississippi to the Gulf
of Mexico. He declared they were the first Europeans to descend the
River Colbert, or Mississippi, and protested against any nation
invading these lands. Then a cross was planted beside the column,
and a leaden plate with the arms of France and in Latin the
inscription, <i>Louis the Great Reigns.</i> Then they all sang the
grand hymn &ldquo;Vexilla Regis&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;The banners of Heaven's King
advance,<br></span> <span class="line2">&ldquo;The mystery of the
cross shines forth.&rdquo;</span></p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXVIII</h3>

<h3>A Blow at Frontenac</h3>

<p><strong>One</strong> day Frontenac received a letter from La
Salle. It told of the discovery of the mouth of the Mississippi.
Here is the letter in part:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>Excellency, at last I have found our goal. A canoe can come from
the Gulf of the St. Lawrence thousands of miles to the Gulf of
Mexico, and it passes through a land rich and fertile, with vast
opportunities for furs, farming, and ranching, and with the hope of
a great future. Nothing can stop me now, save only if you should be
taken from this land. Then I could not count on getting arms and
goods to keep my work going along the Mississippi.</p>

<p>I was seized with illness and for months I lay near to death's
door at Fort Prudhomme, then I recovered slowly, came to Fort St.
Louis, or Starved Rock, and here I have a wonderful settlement. I
have Indians of many tribes, Shawanoes, Abenakis, Miamis, Illinois,
in all near four thousand warriors, and they live at peace with
each other and with me. From my high fort at Starved Rock I look on
a marvelous country, and here I am founding a colony of French and
Indians as a bulwark against the Iroquois, and as a storage of
furs. These furs will go down the Mississippi to its mouth. I will
found a fort there, and they can be sent direct by ship to France.
I know they try to rouse the Iroquois against us, and they may
succeed. That is why it is good to have at this fort so many brave
men combined against our common foe. I should go to Quebec at once,
but if I do, and the Iroquois should attack, it would be said I had
led the Indians into a trap. Tonty and I have built here a fort
which, with proper supplies, cannot be taken, for it can be mounted
only at one side and then one man at a time and with great
difficulty, and we have here stores and dwellings, and have
encircled the summit with a palisade. This fort will hold some of
the French settlers and with the Indians combined at the bottom,
and with proper armament, it cannot be taken. It is small at the
top, but with Fort Frontenac, and Michillimackinac, and this fort
as distributing centers, all capable of good defense, a way may be
found for building here a great granary for France, and a fur trade
which the King will applaud.</p>

<p>All I ask is that I be furnished with arms and goods, and even
with the Intendant against me that is possible. With you behind me,
Excellency, I have no fear. So I shall stay here till I have made
the post secure. I see no chance of getting to Quebec till next
autumn. Meanwhile, may I beg you, Excellency, to present my
discovery to the Minister of the Navy, Seignelay, and to King
Louis. I am writing to Marquis de Seignelay, but if you will permit
me, your official report should uphold what I say.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>When Frontenac in pride read the letter he decided to go to Fort
Frontenac, and have La Salle meet him there, even though it would
give a freer hand to Duchesneau and his friends. Frontenac shrank
not from any course he thought his duty: but he called in Louvigny
before he made his plans.</p>

<p>He spoke with elation. &ldquo;Louvigny, La Salle has reached the
mouth of the Mississippi, as we had heard in rumor, and he is
building a fort on the Illinois, and gathering forces which will be
a center of resistance to the Iroquois. I have decided to go to the
far West. I should give strength to his hands. What think
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louvigny shook his head. &ldquo;You should not leave Quebec now,
Excellency. Your foes are hard at work. They may influence the
King. Your protection of Mademoiselle Darois gave them a point of
fresh attack. You are far from the center.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a frown had come to his face, Frontenac smiled. He felt
that Louvigny was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Louvigny, but I shall see that La Salle has
the arms and goods he needs. No evil shall befall him&mdash;not
while I am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment there was at the Intendant's palace a scene full
of portent for Frontenac and La Salle. A voyageur had arrived and
had gone at once to the palace. He was admitted to the Intendant,
for he was a servant of the Intendant's office. With the Intendant
was Madame Ranard, and the face of the voyageur was excited. When
he entered, the Intendant and his favorite saw there was great
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honor, I have sailed swiftly in my small boat, for I
bring word you have triumphed in France. Within four hours there
will arrive a ship, the <i>Narbonne</i>, and she brings the
dismissal of Count Frontenac!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Ranard's hand went swiftly to her breast in agitation.
This was news indeed. Her brilliant face even turned pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked the Intendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went on board with the pilot, and the captain told me.
He showed me the envelope to Count Frontenac, and one to yourself,
and there can be no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But sometimes the Intendant as well as the Governor goes.
That has been.&rdquo; There was great excitement in the Intendant's
face.</p>

<p>The man nodded. &ldquo;The captain said he was told by
Monseigneur Seignelay, that Your Honor was to remain and that
Frontenac was to go, and that La Salle's discoveries were no longer
agreeable to the Grand Monarch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;like that!&rdquo; said
Madame Ranard, in excitement. &ldquo;It is too splendid to be
true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, gracious madame, as people will know soon. I
slipped from the <i>Narbonne</i> when she was anchored for repairs,
and in my little boat reached here but now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant opened his purse. &ldquo;You have brought great
news, Marsolet, so take this gift from the state.&rdquo; He placed
some of the contents in Marsolet's hands. With many words of
gratitude the man received the gift, but ere he left the Intendant
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not to speak of this to anyone, Marsolet. You
think the Governor does not know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is to tell him, Your Honor? I only know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good&mdash;most good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the man had gone, the Intendant and Barbe were so elated
they could scarcely speak. &ldquo;It has come&mdash;it has come at
last. Heaven be praised!&rdquo; said Barbe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My letter about the Darois girl had much to do with it,
I'm sure. He played into my hands when he took the daughter of the
spy into the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis. That is the kind of mad thing
he does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can arrest the girl when he
goes&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may take her to France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe shook her head. &ldquo;He is no such fool. Besides, the
girl is too clever to go. Her head is better than that of most. She
is as straight as her father was crooked, and she has deepened
Frontenac's friendship for La Salle. I loathe her. She is a curse
to our country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau laughed, and his creased cheek showed his evil
spirit. &ldquo;She will have short shrift with me. I will imprison
her&mdash;at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that will depend upon Bishop Laval,
beloved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant tossed his head. &ldquo;If I have defeated
Frontenac, I will defeat the Bishop&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not you alone have defeated Frontenac; it is the
Bishop and his friends. They are powerful in France. You have not
all the kudos, but you have the bulk of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a deprecating gesture the Intendant said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who is the new Governor&mdash;some one not in
sympathy with La Salle, I'm sure. La Salle troubles Church and
State, and it is good the King sees at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Ranard was a woman of intelligence and vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I do not feel so positively sure. The trouble is
Frontenac has a clever wife, and he has friends at Court. He is a
man of power&mdash;that, at least, or he could not have fought us
all so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has no such power as will save him from fresh defeat;
Once a man is recalled by the Grand Monarch, he ceases to
exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened and shut his hand with anger.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;have fought him always, and at last I have
spoiled him. And now La Salle shall fail completely. He shall not
explore and administer beyond this year. I have provoked the
Iroquois against him; I have said they might take his life and that
France will not object, and if the new Governor says the
same&mdash;and he will soon be here&mdash;what can he do?
Naught&mdash;naught!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet when we had him in just such a net before, he
escaped,&rdquo; said Barbe sagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but Frontenac was behind him, and Frontenac is no
more! La Salle found the mouth of the Mississippi. That's big, yet
Frontenac is recalled, and La Salle is
done&mdash;forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Four and a half hours later, the bells of the Jesuit College and
the cathedral rang, and there was the boom of big guns, for the
<i>Narbonne</i> was entering the harbor of Quebec, and word had
been passed by Frontenac to welcome the ship. He did not know it
contained the record of his removal, but when the letter from
Seignelay was brought inclosing a brief one from King Louis, his
breath came in quick gasps, his eyes went hard and fiery, he
stamped his foot, he burst into oaths which came from a tortured
mind. He had been defeated by lesser men&mdash;the Intendant and
others. It struck him where he was tender&mdash;it was his one
drawback, but he had always been vain from a child, and his heart
was strong against defeat. He had ever proved himself of
unflinching courage and of inflexible will. This blow was a sad
stroke to his pride, but after a short time he calmed himself and
he would face the population calmly. They should not see he had
been struck in a vital spot. They should respect him to the last,
yet to his immense credit in his own beaten state, he said in
bitter regret:</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Salle&mdash;poor La Salle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the man. For an instant his mind dwelt upon La Salle,
then he returned to his own affairs. He called his secretary, and
Barrois came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barrois, I have been recalled by the King, and our work
together is at an end,&rdquo; he said, quietly.</p>

<p>Barrois' face turned pale. &ldquo;Oh, Excellency! Excellency!
That they should be able to do it&mdash;God torture
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God does not torture, Barrois, he does justice, and out
of this will come justice to me. I see myself once more Governor of
Canada. When I get to France&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you get to France the King and Monseigneur Seignelay
will take a new view of you and your work. They will miss things
here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there will be war with the Iroquois and those who
play with them now will pay a bitter price for their folly and
crime. You cannot play with such two-edged tools. They can never be
trusted. I would wipe them from the earth. They bring only evil
with them. They are powerful because they are well organized. When
our foes try to work them for their evil ends, they cut off their
own heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="image">[image: Colbert]</p>

<p>Frontenac dropped a hand on Barrois shoulder. &ldquo;We shall
await composedly the coming of the new Governor. He is not a strong
man or they would not recall me. What lies they have told I know
not, but the King's letter says I have not lived at peace with the
Intendant and the Church and the merchants; and so they reap the
ugly harvest&mdash;my recall! Live at peace&mdash;who could live at
peace here who does right? I love the land with my whole heart, and
I'd give my life for it, and that <i>they</i> would not do. They
are honest&mdash;the Jesuits&mdash;but Duchesneau is not
honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, then a curious look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barrois, no man can do well in his office, who is moved
by a woman. She plays him, and he pays&mdash;he pays!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXIX</h3>

<h3>The New Governor</h3>

<p><strong>A month</strong> later a ship, the <i>Boulogne</i>,
arrived bringing the new Governor, Lefebre de la Barre, an ex-naval
officer, and Frontenac received him with good will and all display
at the shore of the St. Lawrence. There were present militia and
officers and soldiers of France who had come years before&mdash;of
the Carignan-Salli&egrave;res Regiment and of Bearne, and gentlemen
of his court in uniform and laces and colors, and many local
gentlemen and their families, and among them were Madame Louvigny
and Lya Darois, quietly dressed. Some women looked at them
adversely, for they were of Frontenac's household, and Frontenac
was hated by many&mdash;not because of himself, but because of what
he did. They admired his splendid appearance, his undeniable
courage, his power of administration, but that turned them against
him; they were influenced by men folk who thought him evil to the
country's best interests, and they believed it for the moment.</p>

<p>Yet when they saw who succeeded him they turned to Frontenac
with a sense of loss; for Frontenac had presence and great
character, and their new man, in splendid uniform and laces, had
neither character nor dignity. None would turn to look at him
twice, and even Bishop Laval, no friend of Frontenac, shrank from
the hopeless figure. He had no distinction and seemed narrow and
fussy and petty. Even Duchesneau, who had presence, saw in him a
tool.</p>

<p>Frontenac saluted La Barre with elaborate courtesy, then they
embraced, and the Intendant and the Bishop were presented, and a
few others, and Frontenac saw what gave him sorrow&mdash;the thin
character of the man, his pompous vanity, his unreliable soul.</p>

<p>Frontenac said: &ldquo;Your Excellency, I greet you in the name
of the dominions now extending to the Gulf of Mexico and west
beyond to the Great Lakes; you will find it a good and a true land.
It will bring wealth to the Crown. We all love it, as you will do,
and we serve it with whole-hearted love, as will you. You will have
great problems to solve, but we pray your stay here may be for the
good of Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new Governor cleared his throat, and with uneasy eyes and a
fluttering hand replied&mdash;his body restless, his legs rigid,
his face without intellect&mdash;fierce with a passion he could not
have explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no words for what is in my heart, Count Frontenac.
I will do my duty, remembering His Majesty's commands&mdash;to keep
a steady, conciliatory course. Yes, yes, the King must be obeyed,
and I shall approach all questions carefully after consulting with
the Intendant, the Bishop and the Council, and local men of
influence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac's eyes did not show disdain, but he glanced at
Duchesneau and Monsieur de Quebec, and saw satisfaction in their
faces, and disdain in that of the Bishop. He escorted the new
Governor to the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis and gave up the books of
office, and before he left, five days later, he handed over La
Salle's letter, and asked for him due help and men and goods, that
his great discovery should be supported by the Government. La Barre
said he would give it all serious thought, but he was not sure
these discoveries were for the good of the Province of France, and
he would no doubt hear from the Minister upon the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, what is to become of Sieur de la Salle,
Excellency? He is at Fort St. Louis and needs men and stores, and
before you can hear from France he may be wholly ruined. I beg Your
Excellency not to delay bending succor. The King gave him title of
nobility and his commission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give it all most careful thought,&rdquo; said La
Barre, conventionally.</p>

<p>Frontenac was enraged, but protest could do no good. It would
only, maybe, make things worse, so he held his peace, but he said
to Barrois:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no hope for La Salle from the new Governor, but
I will see Seignelay. It is all so grave, so tragic, so critical
for France and Canada!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Louvigny was not going to France. Her husband still
stayed&mdash;on the staff of the Governor&mdash;but she no longer
lived at the Ch&acirc;teau, and Lya still was with her.</p>

<p>At her new home Frontenac saw Lya. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Louvigny will be good to you. These are dark days,
I fear. The future of La Salle is in the hands of God. The new
Governor is not friendly, and dark things may he done, but not so
dark that Heaven cannot make them bright. All will be well with La
Salle in the end.&rdquo; After a moment's silence he added,
&ldquo;I would ask you to come to France, but it might not be
understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; replied Lya, modestly, &ldquo;here is
my place at present. The great man, La Salle, was not born to
fail&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her with satisfaction, and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have trials&mdash;one cannot know what the new
Governor and the Intendant may do, but you will surmount all
dangers&mdash;and we shall meet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac left Quebec with little show of farewell, save for the
booming of the guns that La Barre had ordered, and the hoisting of
the fleur-de-lys on the Ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>Frontenac had scarcely left the harbor of Quebec when the
Intendant summoned Lya to the Ch&acirc;teau, and, though Madame
Louvigny opposed it, Lya said: &ldquo;I shall go, though he means
no good. God has kept me in the past; he will keep me
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the way to the palace she saw Bishop Laval in the distance.
&ldquo;He is not cruel, he is sincere, and I would not fear him. He
is not small,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>At the palace she was shown into the Intendant's office. She
wore a dress most plainly cut, but it suited her figure, and her
fine face was full of expression. Her eyes were steady and her
forehead clear of lines. Her hair hung loose about her neck, as was
the custom of the time.</p>

<p>His eyes absorbed her with the look of one that desired women.
There were none in Quebec with a figure like hers, save one, and
this girl was much younger, and no one had yet had her
love&mdash;or so he thought. He smiled at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a new home, mademoiselle&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She inclined her head. &ldquo;Since Count Frontenac left the
Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, yes. I am with Madame Louvigny, as Your
Honor knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant motioned her to a chair. &ldquo;Will you not sit?
You will be more at ease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya did not like his eyes. She kept her head, however, for what
could he do? She sat in a big low-backed chair, and leaned her arms
on the sides of it. There was determination in her face, and her
eyes bravely met his. He could not read her, clever though he was.
To him all women were alike, to be got at a price high or low, and
he was in power now far greater than when Frontenac was in Quebec.
The new man had no will to follow in Frontenac's footsteps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have asked you here, mademoiselle, to say that for your
father's crime you must be kept in prison. I never shared
Frontenac's view that you were wholly innocent. You hid his crime,
enjoyed his immunity and the salary of his office. You had too much
liberty under Frontenac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl's face flushed with anger and her eyes grew brighter.
&ldquo;Count Frontenac had means of judging my guilt, Your Honor,
and so had Bishop Laval. Do you think the Governor would shelter a
criminal against the land he loved so well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant smiled. Her anger pleased him. He knew she was
innocent and that she had only done what any woman would have done
for a criminal father, but that was naught to him. He observed how
fine her hands were, how delicate her ankles, how radiant was the
air about her. She had the gift of radiance. She was like a planet
with an aureole of her own, and all who met her felt it, though
they loved or hated her. She had an atmosphere as definite as her
person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever knowledge Count Frontenac had, I, as head of the
law, have better. Sieur de la Salle gave your father his deserved
end&mdash;a good act done by one who is no savior of this land. He
hurts it. Although he killed your father, you are his
friend&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bowed her head. &ldquo;My father and his comrade meant to
kill him. He did what any man would do. I have thought, Your Honor,
that there was behind my father a great figure in this
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau got slowly to his feet. The challenge had been bold,
and she had courage to face him so. He frowned, his eyes glistened
with malice. Did she think she could say such things? She had more
than courage, she had rashness. He spoke with control:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All men in high places are slandered. I need not answer
your mad challenge. Do you think I would put myself behind a
traitor? Am I that sort of man&mdash;the Intendant who has
triumphed over its Governor? Is it thought I was behind your
damnable father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her reply was quiet: &ldquo;I do not work things out by logic;
they come through my soul. You have prevailed&mdash;over Count
Frontenac, by what means I know not, but when he comes again you
will not be here, Your Honor! The land will be better for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Intendant laughed sarcastically: &ldquo;Well, well, you are
bold; mademoiselle, and you take risks, for I shall have you
imprisoned. The new Governor will not prevent it, and the Church
will not defend you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not accept the protection of the Church. I am a
good Catholic, but I must be free from such control. No one can
point to crime of mine to warrant prison. One can live but once,
and I will live in my own way in so far as I can. You cannot
prevent that I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau delighted in her noble courage, and she was so
enticing, this orphan girl. He did not reply at once. He walked to
the window and looked out over the great St. Lawrence River to the
Levis shore, and he wondered what to do or say next. The girl was
worth many risks; she was beautiful, valiant, and clever. She was
here in his palace, and he could do what he would. Suppose she
should cry out? Well, and if she should, how would that affect him!
No one would come. Somehow Lya felt what was passing in his mind.
She had in her dim way expected it, and it did not frighten her. At
last he turned from the window.</p>

<p>Coming slowly back towards her chair, he said: &ldquo;Very well,
you shall be put in confinement here in Quebec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was behind her now, and he suddenly stopped, caught her head
back quickly, and before she could prevent it kissed her mouth
again and again. She sprang to her feet, and her eyes loathed
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my prisoner in just that kind of way,&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;Your lips are honey, your person is as sweet as
your mind is reckless. Did you think I would hear all you said and
not reply? You drove me to it. No, no, you need not go to the door,
for I will put you at once in prison!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honor has played a devilish part,&rdquo; she said,
with low anger. &ldquo;Do you think you can make that kind of
prisoner of me? In your mind am I so low as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the most perfect girl on all this continent, and
you can be a great figure here in Quebec, as my friend and
confidante. You have the gifts. You can be to me
what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what Madame Ranard is! You may be a great,
Intendant, but your kisses were blotches of mud in my face. You are
not for me&mdash;no&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, mademoiselle, you shall go to prison. I am
head of the law in this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waved an angry hand. &ldquo;I shall be free to tell the
world what you did to-day, and to turn against you Madame Ranard.
If you imprison me, I, a girl of the people, will fight you to the
end. You are high, and I am low, but right will be with me and I
shall win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will win&mdash;at the price of all you hold most
dear. It will be when I have drunk your sweetness. You think you
can influence Madame Ranard? Try it. She will know you stooped to
slander to gain your ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came nearer her, but she did not move. She simply said:
&ldquo;If you touch me again, I will kill you&mdash;not now, for I
have no weapon, but before you are much older. You are base and
bad, and should not be in power here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;You will not kill me, and you shall taste
solitary confinement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is what you would do! You would give me freedom
if I went to your arms; if not, you will imprison me. You want my
body, and if you cannot get it you do what Indians do, you torture.
That is how the man who fought Frontenac would win. Give me your
prison cell, but remember there is one above all ministers on
earth&mdash;One who controls the world for its own good&mdash;who
is a friend to the helpless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt he had gone too far. He must retract, for she was unlike
any woman he had ever known. She had overwhelmed him by her
innocence and grace; she was the very heart of purity. He could not
fight her and win&mdash;not yet! She was too dangerous to play
with, for she had brains and character. He admired her as she stood
with cheeks glowing, breast heaving, fingers clenched.</p>

<p>His tone changed. &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I have spoken thus and
acted so to try you, and I find you perfect in goodness. I do not
regret, for you have won with flying flags. You have a soul of
heavenly make, a heart of singular goodness. I know the Governor
did well in trusting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face was soft and alluring, and, his manner was that of a
born actor. For so clever a man, he had been reckless, and he was
wise in his present attitude. He civilly waved her to a seat. He
had not convinced her in the least; but it was well to allow him
retreat, for he had power and could defeat her with the people
ready to hear evil of her. She veiled her real feelings.</p>

<p>Her face was still pale, her eyes flashed, her hands were tense,
but she said: &ldquo;It is not the custom to go so far and it is
dangerous. What is it you would have me do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He swiftly had changed his method. He smiled. &ldquo;You shall
not go to prison yet. You shall be free to live your own life. You
are in good care with Madame Louvigny. If you and she would help me
as you helped Frontenac, it would be for the good of Canada. Will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not knowingly help Count Frontenac, though madame
acted as hostess. We cannot do that for Your Honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not be understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By whom, dear mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the public and by Madame Ranard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned. &ldquo;Leave Madame Ranard's name out of it. You
think Madame Louvigny would not help me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, Your Honor. She does not believe in you. She knows
what a foe you were to Count Frontenac&mdash;that through you he
was recalled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau preened himself. &ldquo;That is correct,
mademoiselle. I did it, and for the good of the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bristled up. &ldquo;You think the new Governor compares with
Count Frontenac?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In no sense, but he will do what the Bishop and I ask
him, and the Bishop and I agree in most things concerning
Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tried to ruin Count Frontenac, and you would ruin
Sieur de la Salle; that is your purpose, and as Madame Louvigny
believed in La Salle as she believed in Frontenac, she cannot work
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak for Madame Louvigny assuredly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know her mind, Your Honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau rose to his feet. &ldquo;If not with me, you will not
work against me&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot speak for Madame Louvigny in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for yourself! Well, so be it. I cannot complain. You
have a patriotic mind, destined for high places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went courteously to the door and slowly opened it, smiling,
and so they parted, admiration and black passion in his being.</p>

<p>As she left the palace, every vein in her body tingled with
hatred. She understood him. She knew his malice would still go
on&mdash;that he had tried to deceive her&mdash;that his change of
manner was only due to caution. She had waked him in two
things&mdash;a desire for her, and a devilish purpose to do her
harm in all ways, if she did not come to him. He knew no such thing
as loyalty even to Madame Ranard. She should be his or he would
destroy her if he could.</p>

<p>When she left the palace he paced up and down in anger.
&ldquo;God, she was clever, and she was skilful! She will not give
me away now&mdash;no. I did not foresee how she would twist things.
She is an artist. I must go carefully with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last he was roused by a knock on the door, and there entered
on him Madame Ranard, her face was shining, her eyes were
brilliant.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXX</h3>

<h3>La Salle Struck Hard</h3>

<p><strong>At</strong> Fort St. Louis things came to a climax with
La Salle. There were signs of an attack by the Iroquois, and he had
not enough arms or soldiers to resist them fully. He said to Tonty
&ldquo;I doubt the new Governor, La Barre, means well by us. He
sends naught for which I ask. I have scarce a hundred pounds of
powder here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty nodded, but his face was cheerful. &ldquo;You stay here
yet, lest the Illinois should think you were not their friend, and
if the Iroquois strike it would be bad. Yet it would be well to go
to Quebec, and from Quebec to France, and meet your foes and fight
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's face showed his perplexity. &ldquo;It is a knot hard
to untie, but it will unravel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It unraveled that very day, and La Salle decided to go to
France.</p>

<p>There came from Fort Frontenac news that it had been seized by
Le Chesnaye and Le Ber in the name of the Governor, La Barre, and
they had sold for their own profit the provisions sent by the King,
had lived on La Salle's stores and had turned cattle to graze on
the growing crops. La Forest, in command, was told he might stay if
be joined those against La Salle, but declined to do so, and with
the excellent Fran&ccedil;ois Plet, who had been successful,
started for France after having written La Salle at Fort St.
Louis:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>I have not asked your permission, beloved Sieur, but you will
understand. We will go at once to Paris. Count Frontenac will be
there and we shall prepare the way for you. That you will come to
Paris now, there can be no doubt. You have been vilely
used&mdash;vilely!</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>Reaching Quebec, they at once set sail for France in a ship that
had brought strange news. They declined invitations to the houses
of people of Quebec, for they trusted none save the Louvignys, and
there they supped and were well received. Louvigny had lost his
place with the Governor, but he had interests in trade; he was
well-to-do and had weight with some people. His name was above
reproach, and that he was a cousin of Du Lhut, the famous
<i>coureur de bois</i>, was to his advantage, for he was a man whom
all admired, even though detested by the merchants from whom he
took trade.</p>

<p>They were not invited to the Ch&acirc;teau or the Intendant's
palace, because La Barre and Duchesneau did not wish to hear what
had been done at Fort Frontenac. Their own agents had brought word,
and they had accurate record of all the two did in Quebec. They
knew that at the house of Louvigny they had met the Abb&eacute;
Cavelier.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; was as thin as ever, and as difficult of temper,
and Fran&ccedil;ois Plet did not like him, cousin though he was.
But the Abb&eacute; had invested cash in his brother, and he was
keen to get it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are coming to France to help Robert?&rdquo; asked
Fran&ccedil;ois Plet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my one desire,&rdquo; replied the Abb&eacute;,
with set lips, but he could not have told truthfully what was in
his own mind.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXXI</h3>

<h3>The Other Cheek Also</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Fire!</strong> Fire! Fire! Name of God,
Fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the cry that rang out one night in the Lower Town of
Quebec, and at once the tocsin began to ring and people to
assemble, though many Lower Town folk were away at Montreal on
affairs of business. It began in the home of Esteere Blanchon and,
consuming it, seized that of Philippe Nepsert and destroyed it.</p>

<p>Chartier de Lotbini&egrave;re, Lieutenant-General, summoned
carpenters and hastened to the scene of the fire, down the one
precipitous street from the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, where dwelt
the new Governor, La Barre, the obtuse and obdurate tool of
Monsieur de Quebec and the Intendant. He hastened to the fire, but
De Lotbini&egrave;re and the Intendant were already there and were
in control. Besides, it was the business of the Intendant to
control in such an event, though Frontenac would at once have
commanded all.</p>

<p>There were present, among many others, Duquet de la Chesnaye,
public prosecutor; M. de Pstray, councilor of the Supreme Court; M.
de Louvigny, M. de La Moyne with two of his sons, and many others.
The Lieutenant-General had ordered the carpenters to pull down the
small home of De Saintre and that of the Sieur de L'Espeires to try
to stop the fire, but to no purpose. In increased in great volume
and had covered the street and attacked shops of merchandise and at
last was to <i>attack</i> the shop of the Jesuit fathers.</p>

<p>And here at the fire was La Salle. Madame Louvigny and Lya
Darois were also there, and had withdrawn to the great square,
though they worked hard to help poor people, half mad with terror,
to save some of their belongings. Two-thirds of Lower Town had
already been destroyed and the road to the Upper Town was made
almost impassable by subsidence of rock and earth, and even the
palace of the Intendant caught fire. The Intendant left the square,
followed by the Ranards, and hastened to the big house which was
the pretentious rival of the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis.</p>

<p>La Salle would not go to the Intendant's palace; he stayed in
Lower Town and saw it the victim of the destroying force. Even the
carpenters could do little to resist the hellish sword of flame
which cut wide swathes even upon the waters of the river and
lighted up the shores of Levis opposite. Many people took refuge in
the square and watched the engulfing flood of fire until between
fifty and sixty buildings had been destroyed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tocsin still sounded at intervals, and Bishop
Laval encouraged the people to increase their efforts to save Lower
Town from complete ruin. The heat was great, the excitement
immense, and Laval said sadly to La Salle, &ldquo;Who shall
increase when God says decrease?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur de Quebec, none&mdash;but has God said
decrease?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bishop frowned and waved a hand towards the smoking ruins,
and at that moment the Jesuit shop, which so far had escaped
destruction, caught fire. Priests and others ran forward to enter
the building, and could not at first, but at length two entered,
and one, scorched badly, brought out books of account; but the
other did not come. The first arrived stumbling into the square.
The building was now all aflame and the face of the aged Bishop
turned pale, for he had human sympathy and great natural heroism.
To go himself&mdash;he was ready to do that&mdash;but he had little
physical strength, and the priest would have to be carried. He
looked round among the priests who were near him, but none moved.
It was too dangerous. At that instant La Salle rushed forward into
the sink of flame.</p>

<p>In the square the Bishop and all others watched with deepest
anxiety, but most concerned of all was Lya Darois. It was not alone
La Salle's life, but what would happen to his work of life. It had
entered deeply into her soul. It was her daily thought, her
exquisite indirect ambition. He was on his way to France, he had
come, discouraged, from the far West, through innumerable dangers,
safe; would he come through this? The hand of Madame Louvigny found
hers, and for two minutes, which seemed like ten years, they stood
and watched; the girl grew rigid with intense feeling, her heart
panting like a rock-drill, her face grown haggard. Even Monsieur de
Quebec's face showed anxiety, and all men and women stared in
hopelessness and murmurs ran through the unhappy crowd. Even La
Barre, the Governor, was nervous and agitated and his eyes were
blazing with a fire that could burn naught.</p>

<p>At last from the flaming mass there emerged La Salle, carrying
the unconscious Jesuit. His clothing was aflame, but he staggered
forward till men ran out, among them Monsieur de Quebec, put out
the flames, and took the priest from his arms. The courageous
priest had fainted in the heat and would have been lost forever had
it not been for La Salle.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Quebec raised his hand above La Salle:</p>

<p>&ldquo;God be good to you, my son,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>La Salle, badly but not dangerously burned, replied, &ldquo;But
God did not say &lsquo;decrease,&rsquo; Monsieur de Quebec. Your
priest lives and I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laval felt the sting of the reproof. &ldquo;You are near, then,
to God, Sieur de la Salle?&rdquo; His voice was friendly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I am not far, Monsieur de Quebec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louvigny said: &ldquo;Come, La Salle, come with us.&rdquo; He
took La Salle's arm. La Salle's hands and face were scorched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I can walk to my lodgings,&rdquo; La Salle
said, and he slowly climbed the steep road with Louvigny, Lya
Darois, and Governor La Barre close behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty of courage at least,&rdquo; said the Governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least that,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>Behind in the square, the Bishop, turning from the now recovered
priest to watch La Salle and the Governor climb the steep hill,
shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Salle is a mistaken gentleman. He has no fear, and
helps his foes. Duchesneau thinks only of himself; and the
Governor&mdash;pah!&rdquo; He looked at the ruins of Lower Town. He
sighed. He was a patriot. &ldquo;It will take long to
rebuild&mdash;and we are poor.&rdquo; Then he looked towards the
Intendant's palace, where the fire had been stayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Intendant and the Ranard&mdash;oh, my beloved
Quebec!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw the futile Governor from the heights looking down. Laval
shook his head somberly as De Lotbini&egrave;re drew near to
him.</p>
<br>

<p>As Duchesneau was sitting down to dinner, days after the fire,
his secretary brought a letter just sent from a ship arrived from
France.</p>

<p>It had a royal crest and it came from King Louis. As Duchesneau
read it, his face went white.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>Your usefulness as Intendant is at an end, and you will return
to France by the next boat leaving Quebec. You have made me see
where Count Frontenac erred, and now I see where you
erred&mdash;grievously&mdash;in making La Salle's path too hard.
Sieur de la La Salle has been wrong in much, but you&mdash;in far
more. So, forthwith return to France.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>Duchesneau could scarcely believe. Here after these long years
he was master of Canada, and he was recalled by the King, beaten at
his own game&mdash;by himself. La Salle had been wrong in much, but
he, Duchesneau, in far more. That was his fate&mdash;to be cast
aside when his work was finding true fruition!</p>

<p>As he walked up and down in angry agitation he knew that he had
been his own undoing. He had fought Frontenac and had prevailed; he
had fought La Salle and had prevailed: and yet had not prevailed;
for at his feet lay his own career&mdash;a base and useless
thing.</p>

<p>An hour later Madame Ranard came to him, summoned by a message.
When she saw his face she felt ill had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it&mdash;oh, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave her King Louis' letter. She read it with trembling
fingers and a tumultuous heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God&mdash;good God&mdash;after all these
years!&rdquo; she said, in anguish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all I have done for Canada&mdash;this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pulled herself together. &ldquo;One thing is to do. Get
Bishop Laval to help you. I, too, will go to France, and together
we will put things right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duchesneau's face had anger and despair. &ldquo;The Bishop will
not help, after the fire. La Salle saved his priest. No help will
come from there. Yes, come to France, but that devil, La Salle, may
prevail again. He, too, will come to France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbe went to the window and looked down in the moonlight to
ruined Lower Town. She shuddered and came back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All goes against La Salle, but he reappears. This is our
last effort, Jacques. Let us make it invincible. We will restore
you to the good will of the King, and you shall have another post.
But you shall&mdash;you shall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She kept her head up, but furtive tears were in her eyes.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXXII</h3>

<h3>Once More Versailles</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>No</strong>, no, Monsieur l'Abb&eacute;, I am
come not in defeat, but in victory. I found the mouth of the
Mississippi, with Tonty, the best friend man ever had, and, after
dark dangers, reached my goal. This was my commission from King
Louis, and I was proud of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, and the Abb&eacute; Renaudot said: &ldquo;You have
forced success over bad dangers, and your way may be dark now, but
you will succeed again. Frontenac is here, La Forest and
Fran&ccedil;ois Plet are here, and Prince Conti is your
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle looked at the Abb&eacute; with glowing eyes.
&ldquo;Frontenac, the best Governor Canada ever had, is in
disgrace. He was my true friend in Canada. Where is he
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not in Paris. The King would not see him, and
Seignelay would only give him a cold reception; and the big man,
fierce and insistent as ever, spoke angrily to Seignelay, which was
not for his good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle shook his head with a smile. &ldquo;That is Frontenac.
They shall know his sharp tongue is the most honest thing France
has at the moment. They will know it in good time. La Barre has
slandered me, has robbed my Fort Frontenac of its provisions and
its furs, and has turned cattle on the growing crops. He is a
malicious machine, with little brain and a hateful heart. I shall
never forget the day I left my fort on the Illinois. I looked down
on a big valley, once a place of massacre of the Iroquois, and
there were gathered four thousand Illinois, Shawanoes and Abenakis,
Oujatenons, Nation du Feus, Killaticas, Chaouanons, Kickapoos and
Miamis, and many others, all under my control against the Iroquois.
Here was a colony at peace which had been at war; here is the
center of a new life for Canada. Here when I looked back I saw the
nucleus of a new empire&mdash;Fort Frontenac, Michillimackinac,
Fort St. Louis, thousands of miles apart, and with the mouth of the
Mississippi, making vast links in the chain of territories of the
King. All this had been done with the help of Count
Frontenac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got slowly to his feet and stretched an arm, while his
handsome eyes glowed. &ldquo;My God, I see out there a tremendous
power. It will make for France a new home for millions of her
subjects; it will be a profitable heritage for all time. It is the
work to which I give myself and all that I am. It is my life's
love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My life's love!&rdquo; Did thought of Lya come to his
mind then? Did her face shine between? His eyes took on a weird,
determined look, and he knew that for him there was no love as men
know love, for he had killed the father of the only woman who had
ever moved him in his adventurous life. He put her endless distance
from him, and yet she would always be with him, an inspiring force,
a friend and only a friend&mdash;forever!</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute;'s heart was filled with pride. Here was a man of
men, on whom could be placed all reliance and in whom was all hope.
La Salle stood like a pioneer prophet, with one idea&mdash;the
glory and development of France. No Jesuit was ever more
concentrated than he, no saint more absorbed in the one thing to
do. He was a religious man, but religion was not the first and last
thing with him; he had left its active forces for wider, more
active forces. To him the fear of death was naught. He had seen the
terrible end of life's activities, how often! All motion, all
vitality, all vigorous movements suddenly stopped forever, and all
that man did immersed in the sea of inactivity. The man himself
became a rigid, cold, and emotionless thing; he was engulfed in
Time's blankness: and yet Personality went on forever. To the eyes
of the mortal who does not see the invisible activities that never
die a man's work might be arrested. Personality is memory, and
memory is the biggest thing that comes to life. It never dies. All
the great men that ever lived go on in the memory of mankind, and
from Adam until now are in the world's archives. Christ, Moses, and
all the prophets, if their active mortal life is apparently stayed,
that which they were goes on. Time is the friend of all, it is the
solace for all ills, the chain which binds all men together in the
workings of the world. There is no disappearance; it is only
transformation.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; said: &ldquo;My son, you have the unconquerable
soul. You shall not fail. There are those who can help you, and
they will. But it is yourself that helps you most, for you can make
people believe in you even when they are warned against you.
Frontenac and La Forest and Fran&ccedil;ois Plet as expert
witnesses stand beside you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled; for he knew these men could do naught by
themselves. He had not yet seen either, for La Forest was away at
his father's home, and Fran&ccedil;ois Plet of the Rue St. Martin
had been ill, and they had not yet talked together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all good men&mdash;Frontenac great&mdash;and
they will play their part, but they have no power to open
gates&mdash;none. They can do little alone. Duchesneau, the
Intendant, is here, and the woman, his mistress, but Duchesneau is
in disgrace like Frontenac, and the woman is the only vital spirit
in the group. She is able and persistent and pernicious, and she is
at work now, we may be sure. Her husband is still an officer of the
Government of Canada, and she has entrance to official quarters
here. She is more powerful than them all, but&mdash;&rdquo; He
paused.</p>

<p>Then the Abb&eacute; said: &ldquo;But even she shall not
prevail. She did not before, and she shall not now. She has the
Abb&eacute; Potin, who was the confessor of De Montespan, and the
Jesuit influence with her. That she was the mistress of Duchesneau
does not count, for such women have nine lives to their lover's
one. In France women are powerful, but not with King Louis. No one
influences him, not even De Maintenon, who brought up the children
of De Montespan and is now the secret wife of the King. She was the
widow of the dissolute poet Scarron, and has risen to highest
place. The beautiful De Montespan was capricious and difficult, and
De Maintenon is of smooth, placid temper and gradually got a hold
upon King Louis. She reconciled him to his Queen, and the Queen was
grateful, and De Maintenon's place is forever secure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle nodded. &ldquo;She has supplanted the woman whose
children she raised! She is not ambitious, Abb&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ambitious? Yes, but in a wholesome way. She would not
bear all she has suffered if not ambitious. Her ambition is the
good of France. She is not like De Montespan&mdash;or others who
were playing their own hands always. We priests see, we
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; paused a moment, then rose and laid a hand on La
Salle's shoulder. He looked in his eyes long and earnestly.
&ldquo;You are experienced, La Salle, but you have little worldly
wisdom. I, a priest, have more. The obvious things are not for you.
You forget that men are won as much by diplomacy as by character.
Like all great men, you are a child&mdash;yes, a child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's lips took on a whimsical look. &ldquo;I am as Heaven
made me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While this scene went on between the Abb&eacute; Renaudot and La
Salle, at the H&ocirc;tel des Invalides, Madam Ranard was talking
to the Abb&eacute; Potin, the confessor of the deposed De
Montespan. It was through her he had been made the clerical head of
the new Invalides, and he did his work well. They were in a room of
the vast building which had all the details of noble surroundings.
Not far away was the big tomb with its chapels, all empty as yet,
save for one where was the last resting-place of a great general of
King Louis. From above and from the side windows the sun beat down
with soft power. Of the soldiers who had fought for Louis, numbers
were in the rooms and grounds, and they wandered about with faces
that knew no want, for they were well cared for, were the pride of
the nation. Louis kept his army faithful, and the people faithful
to the army.</p>

<p>The myriad life of the vast hospital gave a new turn to the
splendid career of Louis. It marked the period when he put old
things behind and turned his face to quiet work and the fulfillment
of great ambitions. When he buried his Queen he showed real grief,
and he said the only tears she had ever made him shed was when she
left him forever.</p>

<p>The Invalides was a monument to Louis' vision and patiotism, and
it stands now as a hospital and a tomb and memorial&mdash;national
and imperialistic. He had made De Montespan a duchess, put her into
a convent, parted from her peaceably, had listened to her request
to do something for the Abb&eacute; Potin, and so had made him
Superior here.</p>

<p>Into the room where was a bust of Louis, and a crucifix, and
shelves of books and heavy curtains of purple, and an air of piety,
Madame Ranard was shown. Through the shaded windows there came the
low rumbling sounds of the life of the vast place; it was like a
soft and vivid overture to the drama which would presently be
played. Barbe's eyes fell on the crucifix and she made the sacred
gesture, for she had a superstitious element, and in her crooked
way she was a devout Jesuit. Then she turned to the bust of Louis
and she shook her head, for he did not inspire her. To her he was a
hard machine that would not beat time to her song of life&mdash;a
great man of whom she had a wholesome fear. Even as she sat in this
big handsome room she shivered, for he had seemed to her a personal
danger, yet she knew not why.</p>

<p>Her hand went to her eyes with a sudden start of anxiety, and at
the moment the Abb&eacute; Potin entered, quiet, smooth, dignified,
yet with a stealthiness which was part of his equipment. He had
brains and no real religion. His faith was the business of his life
and valuable only in what it did to advance his interests. His most
striking features were his eyes, which had a look of imagination
and dominance, and yet the rest of his face was an oil of gladness
that soothed the tyrannical glance falling from them. He had a
sense of humor and cynicism not natural to a priest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are again to France, and your friend the
Intendant, once so powerful in Canada, has come too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bowed now and kissed his fingers. &ldquo;We have come to see
if justice can still be got from the court of France. <i>You</i>
have got it, Abb&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled. &ldquo;I am well placed here, but I miss the life at
court. Since De Montespan has gone I am naught there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must still be much nearer the throne. Surely that
is so, dear Abb&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached out slim fingers and raised her chin. &ldquo;Look at
me. I had naught save influence with De Montespan. The Grand
Monarch has done well by me. I am master here and it is comfortable
and interesting, but I am naught at court.&rdquo; His fingers
strayed from her chin to her cheek, and in his eyes was what should
not be in the eyes of a priest. She saw the look and, great actress
and hypocrite as she was, she suddenly rose, wrapped her arms round
his neck, burst into tears, and her lips found his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I cannot bear it, I cannot bear it! I have no power
now in Quebec&mdash;and none in Paris, but I felt you could help
me, dear Abb&eacute;; I felt that. Can you not help me&mdash;please
say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face was flushed, his heart beating hard, but after a moment
of rapture he drew back and controlled himself. She was beautiful,
she was enticing, her touch was so magnetic, her luxuriance so
thrilling, and yet he must not! &ldquo;You should not kiss
me,&rdquo; he said, in a husky voice. &ldquo;It is not what I can
bear&mdash;no. But I will try to help you.&rdquo; He stepped back
from her. &ldquo;You work for our Church and that means much even
in Paris. Now what wish you to do at court? What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To let me talk with Marquis Seignelay. The Queen is dead
and De Maintenon is now the wife of Louis, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; nodded. &ldquo;It is so, and she has vast power,
but in a quiet way. I am told that at conference's with his
Ministers Louis turns to her and says: &lsquo;And what does your
Solidity think of it?&rsquo; He pays no attention to ladies of the
court, is set only on his work. Life is still brilliant at court,
it always will be so while Louis lives, but not in the old dazzling
way&mdash;its gorgeousness and licentiousness. I have no weight now
with De Montespan gone. I have no power. Yet I know Seignelay well,
and in times past have been of service to him. I can perhaps help
you to see him. You did not influence him before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded: &ldquo;But I have seen enough life to know that
to-day's <i>No</i> may be to-morrow's <i>Yes</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; smiled, and a hand went up in amused protest.
&ldquo;You have much wisdom for one so young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face was that of a child as she glanced up roguishly at him.
&ldquo;I am as old as all the hills, and as young as the flowers in
your garden, Abb&eacute;. Make it possible for me to meet
Seignelay. I will try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked with eyes that saw far, and he realized that she was
able, resolute, and very bad, but she was a good agent of the
Jesuits and that was enough for him. &ldquo;You shall see
him&mdash;in good time. I will arrange it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes gleamed; she would have kissed him again, but he gave
no help in this, for he did not wish to give her any power over
him. He had no virtues, yet he had tact and a subtle mind. He
looked at her handsome face, at her exquisite figure, at her
fluttering breasts, and he knew she was ready to give him what he
would, but for him not yet, and not now. She must await events.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will go now,&rdquo; he said, gently but firmly,
&ldquo;and you will hear from me when I have seen
Seignelay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew himself up with pious austerity and held out his hand.
She was quick to understand. No more emotion. She kissed his
fingers, and her hot lips thrilled them and his veins, but he had
the gift of self-control.</p>

<p>He gravely opened the door for her, and she looked at him with
eager feeling in her eyes, but his face was calm.</p>

<p>After she had gone he sat down in a chair meditatively. After a
time he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has greater gifts than De Maintenon or any of them.
She is the everlasting Sybil!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXXIII</h3>

<h3>Old Friends Meet</h3>

<p><strong>Comtesse Frontenac</strong> lived at an apartment in the
old Arsenal, the gift of a French general, Duc de Lude, with
Mademoiselle Outrelaise, and together they were called &ldquo;The
Divines,&rdquo; and this name had been given to the Illinois by La
Salle, but mademoiselle was now visiting her family and the
Comtesse was alone. She and Frontenac had not lived together for
many years, yet she was proud of him and had in these later times
the wish to help him in all ways. She had come of a good family,
the daughter of La Grange Trianon Sieur de Nouville, and she had
run away with him to be married at the little church St. Pierre aux
Boeufs, which could unite couples without the consent of their
parents.</p>

<p>This was in 1648, when Frontenac was a brigadier-general at
twenty-six. Their married happiness was short, for she was witty
and brilliant and self-willed, and Frontenac was masterful and vain
and loved display, and, though not of the highest rank, his
position was an enviable one, for he had been a close friend of
Louis XIII. They had fallen apart, but the years went on. She had
been popular at court, and had at last retired, having little
money. She and Mademoiselle Outrelaise, who never went near the
court, still played a great part in Parisian life, and after
Frontenac went to Canada from the Venetian Embassy where French
troops had been under his command, she who knew now his prodigious
worth helped him all she could, but would not go with him. They
were again the closest friends.</p>

<p>La Salle visited the Comtesse de Frontenac at her home by
appointment, and there he met the returned ruler, who gave him a
hand of warm welcome. The stalwart, self-possessed ex-Governor was
no older; his face was more seamed, but his virile voice rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Barre did not help you&mdash;hurt you every way, and
despoiled our fort, and used you like carrion. He has the soul of a
beetle&mdash;no more, La Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled and turned to the Comtesse. &ldquo;Your great
husband has the soul of a lion&mdash;and more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do not lionize him now,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;but I do not fear the end. So much was made against
Frontenac because he housed the daughter of the spy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac laughed &ldquo;There will be trouble again with the
Iroquois, and La Barre cannot long resist. I have told all to
Seignelay, and he said he would speak to the King, who will not see
me&mdash;yet. These are bad days!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You found the mouth of the Mississippi,&rdquo; said the
Comtesse, &ldquo;and that should influence Louis. There is trouble
with Spain, and the Gulf of Mexico can be used for
attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac nodded grimly and his eyes became somber. &ldquo;But
there is a Count Penalossa here, born in Peru, who was Governor in
Mexico, quarreled with the Inquisition, and came to France. He has
seen Seignelay, and offers to attack Mexico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's lips set sternly. &ldquo;A Frenchman should lead
Frenchmen, and I hope M. Seignelay does not encourage
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Penalossa knows the country, but he should not be
employed by France against his own people. Seignelay takes a wiser
view of things in Canada now, but all moves slowly here, and our
foes work. They are deadly and resourceful. I can do little. But La
Forest and Fran&ccedil;ois Plet must see Seignelay, and, if
possible, the King. The way seemed clear&mdash;the Mississippi
mouth was found by you, and the way was open to big things in New
France&mdash;and then came my fall and your temporary
ruin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both temporary,&rdquo; said Madame la Comtesse.</p>

<p>Frontenac shook his head with an ironical smile. &ldquo;I cannot
see far ahead. That fiend, Madame Ranard, is here. She has the
subtle skill of her accomplished kind. She was seen at the
Invalides&mdash;the Abb&eacute; Potin&mdash;and she influences
those much bigger than herself.&rdquo; He laughed sharply. &ldquo;A
daughter of Satan, surely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked no further, for there came knocking at the door and
a servant entered. &ldquo;Two ladies to see Count Frontenac,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;They will not give their names, but they know Count
Frontenac well. They come from Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three started; the eyes of Frontenac grew bright and he
understood who they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admit them,&rdquo; said the Comtesse.</p>

<p>La Salle's perceptions were not so swift as those of Frontenac,
save with exploration, and he was astounded to see Madame Louvigny
and Lya Darois enter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he said under his breath.</p>

<p>Lya was composed and quiet, yet in her shining eyes was a light
of purpose and high character. The vivid North was in her spirit,
something unlike the artificial ways of Canada and
France&mdash;something mysterious, original; but she had no Indian
blood&mdash;it was the far North, the everlasting pulses of
life.</p>

<p>After the Comtesse and Frontenac had kissed Madame Louvigny and
warmly received Lya, and La Salle had cordially greeted them,
Frontenac said, &ldquo;May I ask why this descent on
France?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Louvigny replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things are bad in Canada. The Governor and the Intendant,
Muelles, work with the Jesuits and all goes ill. I thought it well
to bring mademoiselle here. There is a tale she must tell Seignelay
and the King, concerning the late Intendant. Writing is not
sufficient. The evidence and the presence of mademoiselle are
important to you and to the Sieur la Salle. Words are good, but
personality more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes of the three listeners grew deeply interested, and
Frontenac brought his hand down on his knee with an ejaculation of
emotion. &ldquo;Well said, madame! For myself, I am glad.&rdquo; He
turned to La Salle. &ldquo;You, La Salle, agree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes of La Salle looked at Frontenac, then turned gravely to
Lya Darois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good they have come. Mademoiselle can do most to
show what kind of man defeated the great Governor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Comtesse Frontenac smiled and said: &ldquo;Not defeated,
tricked, and the trick shall not succeed.&rdquo; She looked at
Madame Louvigny. &ldquo;By what vessel did you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Anticosti</i>,&rdquo; said Madame Louvigny.
&ldquo;She was not expected; she came with cargo from the West
Indies. We decided quickly, and came by her. So we are in
France&mdash;at the court of the King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frontenac nodded. &ldquo;And now perhaps Mademoiselle will tell
us of her meeting with Duchesneau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an instant's hesitation on the part of Lya Darois, and
tears came to her eyes, due to the presence of La Salle. As La
Salle looked at Lya there came to his mind one of the old chansons
of Canada he had heard sung on the great rivers. It rang in his
ears now:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;It was a frigate,<br></span>
<span class="line0">My pretty heart of rose,<br></span>
<span class="line0">But, oh, why do you weep so,<br></span>
<span class="line0">My pretty heart of rose?&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>Flushing first, and then turning a little pale, Lya said:
&ldquo;I will tell all that happened at the Intendant's
palace,&rdquo; and exactly all she told&mdash;quietly, yet with a
restrained emotion which stirred them all. She kept her eyes on
those of Count Frontenac and more than once his hand clenched and
fierce resentment came to his face.</p>

<p>When she finished there was profound silence for a moment. Then
Frontenac got to his feet. &ldquo;The black-souled rogue!&rdquo; he
said, fiercely. &ldquo;Ranard was not enough, but he must pursue an
innocent, parentless girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He and La Salle looked into each other's eyes with the anger of
clean-minded men, and La Salle stood up.</p>

<p>They said naught at first, but their hands grasped, and at last
Frontenac said: &ldquo;For Canada's sake, for France's sake, we
must fight it through!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In La Salle's face was the old, indomitable look. He turned to
the Comtesse Frontenac. &ldquo;Madame, I have faith. There is much
to do. We have many foes. The way is dark, but dawn is
breaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya slowly rose to her feet, a strange mystic look in her
shining face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day will come, in God's name!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Tears dimmed her eyes, for she felt herself with two great men,
whose names would live throughout the history of France and it
touched her deeply&mdash;Frontenac greater, because of his past
office and his imperial work; La Salle great in a different way. He
loved his country as Frontenac loved it. He felt the stirrings of
the future awaiting this vast new empire reaching from the far
north to the mouth of the Mississippi, and in him were forces that
would provide for him a glorious immortality. Lya was the daughter
of a spy, but her work would play its part in the life of a vast
continent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day will come, in God's name,&rdquo; she had
said.</p>

<h3>The King and Seignelay</h3>

<div class="verse">

</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p><strong>These</strong> were the words by which the Grand Monarch
was awakened from his sleep at Versailles.</p>

<p>The bedchamber of Louis had white-and-gold blinds, mantels of
bluish marble and large mirrors, richly carved cornices; the west
wall hung with crimson velvet bordered with gold, and his bed was
on an estrade under a high canopy adorned with white plumes. As a
rule the first valet de chambre, Bontemps, woke him. Then a
gar&ccedil;on came to light the fire, and others opened the blinds
and removed the night lamp.</p>

<p>Then came the <i>entr&eacute;e
famili&egrave;re</i>&mdash;Monseigneur the Grand Dauphin, his sons,
the King's brother, and Louis' illegitimate sons. The Grand Dauphin
was fat and good-looking, but the Prince de Conti had broken his
nose when young, and it a little disfigured him. He had a fine fair
complexion, a face of a healthy red, handsome legs, delicate feet,
was fond of the table, avaricious, idle, with little discernment,
and would have made a pernicious King. Few understood him. When he
looked good-humored he was angry; when he seemed amicable he was
ill-tempered; and yet he was no fool.</p>

<p>Louis, knowing his bad qualities, was not fond of him, yet he
had given him the best of tutors&mdash;Bossuet, who became Bishop
of Meux, and Montausieur, and Blondel, and for him Louis wrote his
incomparable memoirs; and all pains were taken to prepare him for
his great responsibilities; but it was of no avail. He had married
the Dauphine of Bavaria and was good to his family, however great
his faults, and they were many.</p>

<p>When he entered the chamber this morning, bedecked with laces
and ribbons as was his wont, the King said: &ldquo;You have the air
of a chanticleer and the gayety of the morning. Listen to that
singing. It gives me good spirit for the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dauphin, ever respectful to his father, bowed, smiled, and
said, &ldquo;The spirit of the Sun King, Sire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King nodded, pleased. Then the nurse who had been with Louis
from childhood came, and she kissed him. With her was admitted the
Grand Chamberlain, M. d'Aumont, first gentleman of the chamber, and
Doctor Fagan and the surgeon who rubbed him&mdash;for he sweated
much&mdash;and changed his shirt.</p>

<p>Next to Louis' bedchamber was the Oeil de Boeuf, the grand
antechamber, and here were gathered the great people who were
privileged to be at the second entr&eacute;e. Among them this
morning were, Louis' chaplain, P&egrave;re la Chaise; the Prince de
Lorraine; the Duc de Guiche; the Marquis de Seignelay; Louvois,
Minister of War; Turenne, the great general; Chamillart, the
chancellor; Moli&egrave;re, who was to breakfast with Louis;
Pelletier, who succeeded Colbert; Duc de Chartres; the Prince de
Joinville; Marquis de Dangeau; Duc de Vendome; Mar&eacute;chal de
Loges; La Comte de Brienne, and many others.</p>

<p>After the choice of wigs for the day came the King's prayers,
and Louis shaved himself every other day with a mirror held before
him by Quentin, his barber. Upon arising Louis had taken two
glasses of sage and veronca, and always on going to bed he had
glasses of water with orange flowers in them. Fully two hundred
people saw him dress, and after dressing he breakfasted simply on
the fare provided by La Quintinie, his cook, after due trial of the
food had been made. This food was always tasted by three people
before Louis ate, and this morning he had Moli&egrave;re to
breakfast with him, autocrat monarch though he was. So it was that
princes and nobles saw Louis at table, while beside him sat a man
of the people whose plays he had helped to make successful, and who
with Racine came as close to Louis as man ever did. Quinault and
Lulli, composers, were praised and encouraged by Louis, and in his
time France rose to greater heights than she had ever done in war,
in literature, in art, and in trade and commerce. Besides,
Moli&egrave;re, and Racine were Corneille, La Fontaine, Lebrun,
Claud Lorraine; Le Notre, Mansart, Massilon, Girardon, Fenelon,
Bourdaloue, and very many others. There was no foppery in Louis. He
was simply dressed, with slight embroidery, sometimes with naught
save a gold button. His vest was of cloth, or red, blue, or green
satin. He wore no ring, no jewels except buckles on his shoes. Yet
he ever wore the <i>cordon bleu</i> over his coat.</p>

<p>Every morning after prayers Louis went to his cabinet, and there
for a few moments he played with the dogs of whom he was
fond&mdash;Diane, Nonne, Folle, Nitte, Blonde, and the rest. He
talked to them as though they were children, and showed his
intensely human character, so much obscured by the conventions and
duties of court life. No King had ever such outer control. His
intense suffering as a youth when in the Fronde rebellion he and
his mother had to flee from Paris influenced greatly his mind. He
had endured cold and hunger and lack of a good bed, and it made an
ineffaceable effect. All he fought for he held, most that he tried
to do he did. Europe fought him as it fought Napoleon. He was
forty-six when he married De Maintenon, and from that day for
thirty years no other woman entered his life. One must think of him
not as of to-day. He was of his time. As Napoleon was hated, so was
Louis hated, but the Revolution which was said to come from his
extravagance, eighty-five years after his death&mdash;after Louis
XV, who reigned sixty years, a bad King, and Louis XVI, who was
stupid, had other origin. Had the Duke of Burgundy, son of the
Dauphin, a brilliant, moral, clear-headed boy, lived, there would
have been no Revolution.</p>

<p>As Louis and Moli&egrave;re sat at breakfast, there was little
talking. With the Grand Monarch, &ldquo;voices were silent; with
Louis XV men whispered; and with Louis XVI they shouted!&rdquo;
During breakfast two sounds came through the windows, the fountains
in the vast gardens with their fourteen hundred jets of water, and
the voice of a woman singing:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Lovely dragon coming back from the
war,<br></span> <span class="line2">Lovely dragon, ran pata, pata
plan,<br></span> <span class="line0">Lovely dragon coming back from
the war!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>Louis, smiling sedately, said: &ldquo;Such singing goes well
with the tune of the water jets in my gardens, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moli&egrave;re replied, &ldquo;Sire, it is the throat of France
that sings? Then there floated in another song:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Out there on the prairie,<br></span>
<span class="line2">I hear my love singing.<br></span> <span class=
"line0">Out there on the prairie,<br></span> <span class="line2">I
hear my love singing.<br></span> <span class="line0">Out there on
the prairie,<br></span> <span class="line2">I hear Nanon
singing.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>Louis smiled again. &ldquo;A soldier of my army who has been to
Canada&mdash;the prairie and Nanon! Well, well, our explorer La
Salle is from the prairie&mdash;yes, yet he has no Nanon there, I
hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After breakfast the captain of the bodyguard said in a loud
voice, &ldquo;Gentlemen, the King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his way to chapel anyone who wished could speak with Louis.
The work of the day was ever carefully planned. So long as he
lived, this small but impressive figure worked as few men worked
then or now. His own Prime Minister, the head of all departments,
his own Foreign Minister, writing or dictating letters to
ambassadors, and every detail of domestic political economy was at
his finger's ends. Little escaped his notice, little happened that
he did not realize, for his observers were everywhere. Vanity he
had, but the vanity of a trained, precise, observant mind, without
vast temperament, but with the imagination of the French people
which lifts its owner out of the commonplace&mdash;the dust, the
ditch, and the stable-yard of life. Bolingbroke, the great English
ambassador of Charles, said, &ldquo;If King Louis was not the
greatest King that ever lived, he was the best actor of majesty, at
least, that ever filled a throne.&rdquo;</p>
<br>

<p>Two days after the meeting at the house of the Comtesse
Frontenac, King Louis was closeted with his Minister, Seignelay,
and near by sat Madame de Maintenon. De Maintenon, the widow of
Scarron, the poet, born a lady, had seen the entry into Paris of
King Louis in 1660 on the occasion of his marriage with Maria
Therese; had admired him then and had served him ever since,
directly and indirectly.</p>

<p>No one knows whether De Maintenon had planned for dominance in
his inner life over Louis, but slowly, surely, she had come through
a series of hateful attacks and cruel crises to the time when in
the third of the four phases of his life he needed her
most&mdash;if he needed anyone. Her friendship with De Montespan
had founded her fortune. Even her title and estate were got on the
effort of De Montespan. At first Louis had not liked her, but her
letters to De Montespan converted him, they were so well expressed
and interesting. De Montespan's capricious ill-humor at length
alienated the King, and Louis turned to Maintenon more and
more.</p>

<p>Then he fell in love with her, but she acted the coquette and
wore her garb of piety, and fascinated and evaded him. And so it
was that in June, 1684, De Maintenon was married to Louis in the
Chapel of Versailles at night. P&egrave;re la Chaise said mass at
the altar prepared by Bontemps, the King's first valet, and
Archbishop Harley of Paris read the service, and Louvois and
Montchevreuil were witnesses.</p>

<p>At length De Montespan came to pay her respects to De Maintenon,
the wife of King Louis. All her friends&mdash;the Mortemarts, the
Thianges, the Rochehouarts&mdash;her own family&mdash;and the
Mar&eacute;chal de Vivonne urged her to pay homage.</p>

<p>So in a robe of gold and silver she went, and De Maintenon sat
in a chair of rich brocade. Louis was present and De Maintenon did
not rise, but after some talk while Louis worked, told the still
beautiful De Montespan what was intended for &ldquo;<i>Our</i> Duc
de Maine,&rdquo; De Montespan's own child by Louis, and other plans
for Montespan's children, the Count of Toulouse, Madamoiselle de
Blois, Louise of Bourbon, and Fran&ccedil;ois of Bourbon, all of
whom had been legitimatized by Louis!</p>

<p>On her stool the humiliated but proud De Montespan saw De
Maintenon whom she had made, at the head of all, though not
declared Queen, and she never was, though Louvois, who influenced
the King against the formal declaration, was never forgiven by De
Maintenon.</p>

<p>As De Montespan left Maintenon's presence, the latter said,
&ldquo;Do not let us cease to love each other, I implore
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among those who waited outside to see the fallen favorite were
the astute and able Duc de Saint-Simon, the insufferable Princess
d'Harcourt, tall, fat, ugly and gluttonous, Duc and Duchess de
Beauvilliers, Duc de Coislin, and Prince Salm, who pressed her hand
tenderly and said, &ldquo;You are flushed and I can well understand
why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ere long the pensive but bitter Montespan was to retire, spend
her last days in a convent, and hold a kind of court, receiving in
sumptuous style.</p>
<br>

<p>After the chief business of the day had been settled, Seignelay
spoke to the King about La Salle, of his strife with the Church in
Quebec, of his finding the mouth of the Mississippi, and of his
proposal to settle it with Frenchmen. He would later bring down
from the North Indians to invade and conquer Mexico, and provide a
port to which trading vessels could sail the year round as they
could not do in the St. Laurence.</p>

<p>At the mention of Mexico, Louis' eyes lighted. He grew at once
interested. &ldquo;Mexico&mdash;Mexico&mdash;yes! Things go ill in
Canada,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Much trouble falls there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay shook his head. &ldquo;De la Barre has destroyed Fort
Frontenac, stolen its stores, and ordered your supplies to be
scattered, and lets the Indians destroy the crops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis' brows knitted. &ldquo;Destruction, eh! Evacuation, theft.
Come, come, La Barre! Who brings this to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De la Forest, in late control, and Fran&ccedil;ois Plet,
who loaned La Salle money and was asked to go to Fort Frontenac and
administer its finance, because La Salle has little gift that way,
but has genius for exploration and settlement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Then Louis shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was folly to recall Frontenac. As for Duchesneau, he
is the cause of all. He lied, I suppose, about that girl, the
daughter of the spy. Frontenac sheltered her at the Ch&acirc;teau
St. Louis, although her father was a traitor. That influenced my
mind, yet who could tell! Frontenac was bitter, quarrelsome, and
difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay quietly said: &ldquo;Sire, the girl has come to France
with Madame Louvigny, who cared for her after she went to the
Ch&acirc;teau, and she, Lya, I hear, has that to tell of the
Intendant which may affect your policy in Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis looked up sharply. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay glanced at his watch. &ldquo;She should be in the
palace now, Sire. At the request of Prince Conti I consented to see
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good, good! Bring her to me here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay seemed astounded. &ldquo;You wish to see her here,
Sire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King laughed. &ldquo;Even as I said&mdash;if her Solidity
makes no objection&mdash;here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame De Maintenon, who had not spoken, smiled and inclined her
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then bring her, Seignelay. I would see her&mdash;and one
moment, I would see La Salle also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay was pleased. &ldquo;I fear, Sire, I could not reach La
Salle at once, but within the day, at your will, he shall be
brought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis nodded. &ldquo;Then the girl at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay rose. A moment later a messenger was on the way to Lya
Darois.</p>

<p>Louis turned to Madame de Maintenon: &ldquo;Since La Salle found
the mouth of the Mississippi it is a vast estate I have yonder. I
could put in it provinces of France and have enough left for ten
Englands and twenty Belgiums. I see now clearly this New France
which Cartier, Champlain, Maisonneuve and La Salle have made
possible to my France. Yes, yes, I see. What will come of it? Who
knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After an instant De Maintenon carefully said: &ldquo;Sire, you
know. It all is yours, your fate, your destiny. What you do will be
right, Sire. You are France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched himself proudly to his brief height, but there was
greatness in him from first to last. As a child of ten he had said
to his mother at Fontainebleu, &ldquo;I will govern now,&rdquo; and
from that time to the day when, his work done, he sent De Maintenon
to the convent of St. Cyr and closed his eyes to the pomps and
vanities, the powers and achievements of his great time&mdash;he
governed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must obey the soul of France, and that soul says,
&lsquo;Be just, be generous to Canada.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon he sat down and worked silently. De Maintenon,
handsome, quiet, with beautiful eyes, watching&mdash;watching. No
time of hers was her own. She was the galley slave of state from
the moment of her waking till Louis bade her good night. Even her
meals were interrupted. If physically unfit, it made no difference.
She paid the heavy price for what she was.</p>

<p>At last the door opened. With Seignelay, Lya Darois entered the
presence. Her face was pale, but her eyes shone, she trembled
slightly. Seeing the King, she bowed her head, dropped to her
knees, and kissed his outstretched hand. She did not dare look up.
Much honor had been done her. No lady had ever before been admitted
to the workshop of Louis XIV. With self-control she remained
kneeling.</p>

<p class="image">[image: Madam de Montespan]</p>

<p>If there was one on earth who understood the human heart in a
vague yet certain way, it was King Louis. Her humility touched him.
Her curious beauty, so unlike that of any woman he had ever seen,
impressed him. His words to De Maintenon: &ldquo;I am France, the
soul of France,&rdquo; came to his mind now, and he said to her,
&ldquo;Arise and look at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got to her feet slowly, looked him in the eyes, and, as she
looked, a strange, passionate simplicity and beauty filled them,
but it was all joined to such modesty, to such demure dignity, that
Louis gently said: &ldquo;Mademoiselle, tell me why you came to
France? I will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not speak instantly, but after a moment she told him
of her stay at the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, of all that Frontenac
had done for her, of the shame and disgrace of her parentage, of
her faith in and her admiration for the man who had killed her
father. Then she told of the visit to Duchesneau at the palace and
all that happened there.</p>

<p>When she had finished in tears and her lips trembling, Louis
said: &ldquo;The low dog! So ho influenced us, eh! Before God, I
will attend to him. The woman, Ranard, she is here too,
Seignelay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay bowed his head: &ldquo;She also is here, Sire, and is
a friend of the Abb&eacute; Potin. She has seen him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis smiled grimly: &ldquo;Potin! Potin! whom I put at the head
of the Invalides. Not a good man, but an able
abb&eacute;&mdash;reward for useful service. He confessed one who
was once&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced curiously towards De
Maintenon&mdash;&ldquo;in a post of some importance.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXXV</h3>

<h3>Point to Point</h3>

<p><strong>A few</strong> hours later Seignelay was visited by the
Abb&eacute; Potin, who came to influence him against La Salle. They
were both astute men, but Seignelay was far the bigger in character
and in intellect, and he was without prejudice against La
Salle&mdash;and now without prejudice against Frontenac. His face
showed little emotion. It was calm, powerful, implacable,
determined. He was handsomer than his father Colbert, and nearly as
able. He had the greater spirit of France conceived by Richelieu,
developed by Mazarin, and continued by Colbert with Louis XIV.</p>

<p>As the Abb&eacute; approached the palace, full of sophistry and
subtlety, his whole being alert, he heard a young woman
singing:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Ah, if I had a round
penny,<br></span> <span class="line0">Ah, if I had a round
penny,<br></span> <span class="line0">I could buy a white
lamb,<br></span> <span class="line6">La verdi, la
verdon,<br></span> <span class="line0">Et loupe, sautez, donc, la
verdon.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>The Abb&eacute;'s attention was arrested. He knew the song. It
was of Touraine, where he was born, and he had heard it as a child.
The girl was a Touranian. She was comely and joyous, yet there was
sadness in her voice. She would buy a white lamb, would she? Buy a
white lamb! There flashed to his mind the Lamb of Calvary, and so
it had seemed to him in his youthful days before he decided to
become a priest. The Lamb of Calvary&mdash;and he was on his way to
belie all his earlier hopes to waste his naturally big soul in a
pernicious cause. He watched this girl till she disappeared, and
then, shaking his head, went on his way. He was touched somehow by
this quaint doggerel ballad, for he sighed and a somber look came
to his eyes.</p>

<p>When he entered Seignelay's room, the glimmer of a smile played
at the Minister's lips, for he knew there would now come contest
between the Church as represented by the Jesuit body and
Abb&eacute; Potin, and the King as represented by himself. The
immediate issue might not be immense, but the principle at stake
was as big as France itself and greater than France itself.</p>

<p>There they were, Seignelay soberly but elegantly
dressed&mdash;though not so gorgeous as many of his
confr&egrave;res&mdash;with ribbons and color and bright lapels and
soft lace, and above all a head with long hair, vigorous, powerful,
and resolute. The glitter below was as naught to the quiet dignity
above. That was France under Louis XIV. There was great ceremony
and color and swords and ribbons and laces, and the outer
flamboyance of life and society, but above all was firm unshaking
purpose.</p>

<p>Opposite was the lean, clean-shaven, handsome, sensuously
ascetic face of the representative of the Church, in his plain
cassock and plain black belt, lightened by the glimmer of white
collar at the throat. The Abb&eacute; Potin represented the
austerity of the Roman Church, but behind this austerity was the
same glitter and show which marked the court and the social life of
France. Richelieu, Mazarin, both cardinals, lived in magnificence,
and the Palais Royale, next to Versailles the greatest building in
the French Empire, was the home of Richelieu and Mazarin, and now a
palace of the King.</p>

<p>Never in history had there been such state power in France;
never such power of the Church as was to be seen at Notre Dame and
in the great cathedrals. Money, the Church had as much as the
state. Power, it was worldwide. Purpose, it was touched, how
terribly, by ambition to control. All these things were in the mind
of Seignelay as he looked at this quiet, self-assured, ingratiating
figure before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Abb&eacute;, how like you your new office at the
Invalides? Well, I hope:&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; bowed and smiled. &ldquo;The honor is great, the
duties are many. I can but regret it has no higher governor than
the poor Abb&eacute; who comes to you to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irony was in the face of Seignelay as he said: &ldquo;Time works
in all development, but it cannot tarnish the present ruler of
France.&rdquo; His eyes lighted. &ldquo;Far beyond our dear land,
on that vast continent of America, the state&mdash;with the
Church&mdash;plays its prodigious part. Missionaries&mdash;the
Recollets, the Sulpitians, and the Jesuits&mdash;have proved that
France is not the slave of luxury, expenditure, and vapid social
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay said these things not with his tongue in his cheek,
but preparing for the encounter to come. &ldquo;Listen,
Abb&eacute;,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;everywhere in Europe,
France is at the head. We have the greatest generals the modern
world has known. As for our navy, my father built it up from fifty
ships to its present force of three hundred men-of-war. France is
now at her greatest period in literature, in art, in sculpture.
Trade flourishes and will flourish more and more, because the Sieur
de la Salle has opened the way to the conquest of Mexico, and the
increase of our trade and commerce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; bowed and his face flushed a little. &ldquo;That
has brought me here, Monseigneur. Is Sieur La Salle then to form
settlements near the mouth of the Mississippi? Is that the purpose
of His Majesty of France?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one knows the purpose of France until he himself has
spoken. What I know I do not know. What I think I do not think. It
is not the duty of a Minister to declare the high master's will
until commanded to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sly, sardonic smile touched his lips. &ldquo;The Church is no
friend of La Salle, Abb&eacute;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It has
pursued and defeated him where possible, tried indirectly to poison
him, destroyed his ships, captured his men, wasted his
goods&mdash;No, no, no, do not object. What I say can be said to
all the world, but I do not choose to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute;'s eyes flashed and indignation touched his lips.
&ldquo;The Church has been true to the policy of the King, and that
our missionaries gave their lives after torture is best proof of
the fidelity, honor and piety of our Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not best proof of its imperial wisdom, no. You would
convert the Indians, but make them always the servants of the
Church. It is not white settlement you want in the West and the
South. It is native settlement which the Church would forever
control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got slowly to his feet. &ldquo;And there can be no question
of who shall control within the territories of Louis XIV, none. His
policy prevails. Pope or priest are as naught to him when it is a
question which shall be the final power where his flag flies. The
fleur-de-lys always, before all else always. Also Christ and his
Church always, but not to control the state. No, no, Abb&eacute;,
be sure of this&mdash;New France with all its magnificent
possibility belongs to the people of France, and the people of
France are the rulers of France. You wish to influence His Majesty
against La Salle through me. To be frank, enough of that influence
has been shown. Through it Frontenac and the Intendant have been
recalled&mdash;the one a good great man, the other a low bad man.
The Intendant lied to me and to the King. We know the truth. While
the world stands, Duchesneau shall never again represent France in
any part of her dominions. Frontenac is, and has always been, an
honest man; La Salle, one of the best of the King's loyal subjects.
No, Abb&eacute;, come not here against La Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face of the Abb&eacute; Potin was white and rigid. &ldquo;I
came because it was my duty. I am faithful to my Church and to my
vows. The Church has naught against La Salle. It only opposes his
mad policy, which was against the policy of the King, who told us
he wished no settlement on the Mississippi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay smiled. &ldquo;Then Kings may not change their minds
and alter their policies? Greatness lies in the power to change the
mind and have a masterly retreat if necessary; but there is no
retreat! King Louis does not retreat or retract. He restrains those
who fight him; he develops those who march with him. La Salle is
marching with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am nobody,&rdquo; replied the Abb&eacute; Potin,
bitterly. &ldquo;I came because you have known me long and well and
to plead with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you well, Abb&eacute;, and while I would work
with you, I would never let your influence touch my judgment. I
used you years ago concerning the Abb&eacute; Renaudot, and you did
well. You have your reward&mdash;the Invalides. There is naught
more to say. I trust your Church will not oppose La Salle, for it
is to oppose France. Did you ever think how poor La Salle is? He is
vastly in debt, and yet he can get money. Is that one in whom
confidence may not be placed?&rdquo; Seignelay came forward and
held out his hand: &ldquo;Say not more, Abb&eacute;, but bid me
<i>au revoir</i>. You will have no place for me at the H&ocirc;tel
des Invalides. I am no soldier and no general, and shall have no
monument there, so be content that in death I shall not disturb
your peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grim humor of the Minister overcame, for a moment, the anger
of the Abb&eacute; Potin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never disturbed my peace in life, and could not
in death, monsieur,&rdquo; and in the note of the Abb&eacute;'s
voice was also a touch of satire.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXXVI</h3>

<h3>Again Ranard</h3>

<p><strong>That</strong> night late, La Salle was walking to his
apartments. The street was narrow, deserted, and unlighted, though
a faint moon was showing. He had spent the evening with the
Abb&eacute; Renaudot after visiting the Prince de Conti, where with
La Forest and Fran&ccedil;ois Plet he had made a convincing
statement to Conti. He had been told of the visit of Lya Darois to
King Louis and of her triumph there, and somehow hope, faith, and a
new ambition stirred deeply in him.</p>

<p>With a spring in his step he neared his apartments. At about
fifteen feet from the door, with the instinct of the trained
woodsman, he felt stealthy steps behind him and swung round. As he
did so a lariat flew over his head and would have garroted him, but
his hand shot up to the leathern ropes. Then two men sprang towards
him. With one swift, prodigious kick he struck one of his
assailants well below the belt, and with a shriek of pain, the man
fell backwards and writhed on the ground, and the other he caught
by the throat. The struggle was fierce, for the man was strong and
a trained murderer, but La Salle had the gifts of an Indian
fighter, and he freed the rope from the hand of the garroter, swung
him to the ground, and buried powerful fingers in his throat. The
murderer's tongue came out of his mouth, his face turned purple,
his struggle became fiercer, and then suddenly relaxed, and he was
gone. La Salle sprang to the other man, whose agony was still
great, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me who sent you, or you shall die also.
Speak&mdash;my hands are at your throat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still twisted with pain, the murderer said, &ldquo;Madame
Ranard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So this was her last attempt to drive him from the field. She
had heard of Lya Darois' success with King Louis, and now would put
him out of the battle by garroting. Taking a small whistle from his
pocket, he blew it. Presently he saw running to him through the
street three gendarmes. He pointed to the two men and to the
lariat, and said: &ldquo;They tried to garrot me. The one I killed,
the other is there injured. I am the Sieur de la Salle, explorer
from Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gendarme in command looked closely at the faces of the two
men on the ground. &ldquo;I know them,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they
are notorious. You have a strong arm, Sieur de la Salle. Two men at
once is immense. Why did they attack you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle was about to reply, when the man on the ground still in
agony, said: &ldquo;We were paid by Madame Ranard. We know not
why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a firm voice La Salle said: &ldquo;My
address&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to the door&mdash;&ldquo;is this.
Come when you have disposed of these men and I will explain. Will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gendarme looked him up and down, smiled grimly, and said,
&ldquo;Yes, m'sieu', I will come.&rdquo; He turned to his comrades
and they lifted the dead man and carried him, while the chief
gendarme gave his attention to the living criminal, and La Salle
entered his rooms.</p>

<p>Seated in the small salon dimly lighted, La Salle considered his
position. Surely God had been good to him, for again and again his
life had been attempted, and yet he had escaped. Every pulse was
beating hard and his heart was high. He believed he was now on the
road to definite success. The odds against him had been
innumerable, but here he was at the foot of the throne, waiting the
final judgment of the ruler of France, for the new commission which
would send him to lay the foundation of a great empire of the
South.</p>

<p>As he sat, the three mouths of the Mississippi were before him,
and the broad water and the tang and the smell of the Gulf of
Mexico. Once again he saw the clear blue sky, the bright sun, the
everlasting sea. He stood up, and slowly paced the room with
elation and resolute will. He could not exactly forecast what the
State would do, but it was clear it meant good to him or Barbe
Ranard would not have sent these criminals to drive him from the
field.</p>

<p>At last there came a tapping at the outer door. Presently there
entered the gendarme who was in some ways a cut above his business.
He had a face of intelligence, though a tongue that did not speak
good French and a heart that would not do bad things. He doffed his
head-gear and would not be seated until La Salle motioned to a
chair. In it he sat like some uncouth baron of an uncouth county,
but with a far-seeing eye.</p>

<p>He had not yet opened his mouth. He waited. They measured each
other. The judgment on both sides was good. At last La Salle said:
&ldquo;My life is of value to myself, but it is also of value to
our nation&mdash;I have discovered the mouth of the
Mississippi!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mouth of the Mississippi!&rdquo; said the gendarme.
&ldquo;The mouth of the Mississippi! Think of that! I had a brother
who served under Du Lhut in the Western country. The mouth of the
Mississippi! Oh, bidemme!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I discovered it, and I see a vast field of settlement,
but I have bitter foes. The Jesuits are against me, and Madame
Ranard, the mistress of the late Intendant, Duchesneau, is their
tool. Now you know why I have been attacked to-night. My foes stop
at nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't think the Jesuits ordered this attack, m'sieu'.
But no, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They order no attacks, but they have agents, and the
agents do as Madame Ranard tried to do more than once to me in
Canada. I tell you because I do not wish this man to be tried in
public. If he is tried the truth must be told, and at this moment I
do not wish France to know that behind this woman was the Church,
and yet that truth must be told at the trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gendarme frowned. &ldquo;The woman should die, m'sieu'. She
had not courage to kill, but she got hireling beasts to do it. It
is vile, so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know how vile, but I know what is best. That is why I
tell you the whole truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows I like the truth!&rdquo; said the gendarme.
&ldquo;There is too little truth in France. Yes, <i>par la
bapt&ecirc;me!</i> I like the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle thought for a minute, then he said: &ldquo;It will be
enough to get power from the King to continue my work. I am willing
this man should escape, if you can permit it, and that the woman
shall not be punished. If I get the rights I seek, she cannot touch
me again. The Intendant is gone from Quebec, and I am told the King
has no will to give him place again, but may send him to the
Bastille.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman is foul; she should die&mdash;but yes!&rdquo;
said the gendarme.</p>

<p>La Salle did not speak at once; he poured out a goblet of wine
and gave it to the gendarme, then poured one for himself. They
drank, and La Salle filled the gendarme's goblet again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman is foul, as you say, but she gets punishment in
the failure of her plans, which is a torture to her. I ask that
this man shall escape, and the woman be free from state
reprisal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Lord, one would think you loved her,
m'sieu'!&rdquo; said the gendarme, bluntly.</p>

<p>A grim smile played at La Salle's lips. &ldquo;She is
beautiful&mdash;she is young&mdash;she has the grace of a great
lady, but love her! It would be ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gendarme frowned. &ldquo;Then why in God's name should she
go free, I ask you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is clear I have told you badly, for you don't
understand. Will you give me word that you will let this man escape
and not inform on the woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something communistic in the gendarme. He had no love
for beautiful ladies of society, nor for society itself. His one
passion was doing his duty&mdash;a rare thing in corrupt but
imperishable France.</p>

<p>The gendarme did not at once reply, but moved his head from side
to side in cogitation, but at last he thumped his knee: &ldquo;Very
well. It shall be so. But I am not alone. My comrades heard what
that murderer said, and they may talk. I cannot clinch their
tongues, but no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said La Salle. &ldquo;Good! We must take our
chances on that. I do not like to offer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gendarme looked up quickly. &ldquo;Offer naught, m'sieu'. Do
not try to buy a gendarme of France. That's too ugly in an ugly
world! I'm not for sale; <i>nom de chien!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled: &ldquo;I would not try to buy you, my friend,
yet I beg you to accept now, since you have promised, this small
gift from a poor man who wishes&mdash;for France's sake&mdash;he
had riches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pressed a purse into the hand of the gendarme.</p>

<p>The gendarme's face was now a study. &ldquo;Well, if you had
offered it before I'd promised, I'd have thrown it at your feet,
m'sieu', but I'll take it now because you have not tried to buy
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done, well done!&rdquo; said La Salle. &ldquo;Give
me your name and address. I shall care to meet you again before I
start my long journey to the mouth of the Mississippi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment later he had the address on a slip of paper, and
presently the gendarme was gone with these words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;M'sieu', but, m'sieu', I could follow you&mdash;to
hell!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXXVII</h3>

<h3>&ldquo;Forty Stripes&rdquo;</h3>

<p><strong>The</strong> gendarme who had promised La Salle was
right. Before he could arrange the escape of the prisoner, one of
his comrades had told a spy of Seignelay that La Salle had been set
upon by two garroters paid for by Madame Ranard. He did not
discover this until he learned that Barbe had been arrested
secretly by command of the Ministers. It was too late to do aught.
He could not find La Salle and tell him.</p>

<p>La Salle's anxiety was great. His big heart was against harsh
punishment to the woman. She deserved the worst that might be, as
Nicolas Perrot, the explorer, had done, but he had forgiven
Jolycoeur, behind whom she was. It was little to conquer the
violence of one of the weaker but subtler, more dangerous and more
bitter sex. She was as bad as any woman had been in the history of
France, but he hoped for fresh commission for settlement at the
mouth of the Mississippi, and this dark incident might prevent its
fulfillment.</p>
<br>

<p>In confinement, Barbe Ranard, with the vigor of mind which had
not yet deserted her, thought that if she might reach the cathedral
of Notre Dame she would be safe. <i>There</i> was sanctuary, as
Cardinal Retz in the early part of Louis' reign had found. She had
much money with her, and she arranged to bribe one of her guards.
He was a man of dissolute habits and of polluted soul, and she was
ever a master of such men.</p>

<p>She smiled at him, and with a graciousness for which she had a
reputation said, &ldquo;This is no place for a lady, my
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He twisted a leg. &ldquo;Ladies come here just the
same!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But never a lady like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded. &ldquo;None so beautiful, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why should I remain? It is the evening, and all is
dark. Why should I remain here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because King Louis says so, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot buy King Louis!&rdquo; she replied, meaningly.
His face took on an acquisitive look, for he had no cash, and he
was thirsty and poor, and his nature was carnal and selfish, and he
had no sense of duty. He had risked his life often, and had
escaped, and he could risk his life again if it was worth
while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would take more cash than anyone has to buy him,
madame. Not all the gold in France buys him. He is France, he buys.
He has bought other kings and rulers and bishops, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came close to him, so near that the perfume of her clothes
came to him, and, oh, but she was ravishing, and perhaps it was
intended to behead her&mdash;this exquisite creature!</p>

<p>She said: &ldquo;No, I could not buy King Louis, but is your
price so high?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gendarme drew his hand across his mouth. &ldquo;I ain't got
any price&mdash;but no. I'm a soldier on duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will name the price, soldier: A kiss,
and&mdash;&rdquo; She whispered to him.</p>

<p>His face grew inflamed. &ldquo;So much? What proof!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the kiss,&rdquo; she said, and she kissed him
with a smile&mdash;his big fat, preposterous mouth. Then she drew
from her bosom a silk purse and thrust it into his hand.
&ldquo;There is a fortune for you, my friend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes blinked. &ldquo;I could take this and not do you
service, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will, for I have kissed you? You will set me
free&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sniffed, looked at the purse in his hand, then said, &ldquo;I
take bad risks, madame, but yes.&rdquo; He looked into the purse.
&ldquo;Here is enough for many a year. See&mdash;in ten minutes or
so we take you to another prison <i>en route</i> to Notre Dame! On
the way there you will escape&mdash;and we will follow you. You
will not be bound, for we are armed and you have no weapons.
There&mdash;if that may suit you, madame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later she was taken from this cell and was marched
through the streets and, thank God, towards Notre Dame. Suddenly,
when they were not far from the great cathedral, she jumped and
ran. The gendarmes did not fire, for they had no such orders, but
they followed through the dimly lighted streets, her own gendarme
purposely leading his comrades away from her. As she ran swiftly,
for she was fleet of foot, she heard a voice in the street shouting
after her:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line3">&ldquo;When Marion goes out,<br></span>
<span class="line4">When Marion goes out,<br></span> <span class=
"line4">She never walks, she always runs,<br></span> <span class=
"line4">Deriron, bah, bah, derirette,<br></span> <span class=
"line4">Gai, gai, oh, gai, gai,<br></span> <span class=
"line4">Derirette!<br></span> <span class="line0">And I am the
shepherdess of all,<br></span> <span class="line0">And I am the
shepherdess of all,<br></span> <span class="line0">I will give her
to the wolf,<br></span> <span class=
"line4">Derirette!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>So that was it&mdash;and the wolf might get her. She ran. She
was now near Notre Dame, and people watched excitedly the flying
criminal. The dark walls of the great church came up before her
eyes. She rushed for them and reached them, ran up the steps, but
now behind her she heard swift feet, and the doors of the church
were shut. She beat on them with her frenzied hands, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sanctuary! Sanctuary! O God, Sanctuary!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But before the doors were opened the gendarmes were upon her,
and even as they swung back to the hands of a priest they came
between. She was captured again, and she fell fainting in the arms
of the gendarmes, among whom, vastly perturbed, was the man who had
helped her. He had in vain tried to misdirect them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Heaven and Hell!&rdquo; he said, bitterly.</p>
<br>

<p>La Salle arrived at the court-room, and he learned that at the
suggestion of King Louis, before whom it had all been put by
Seignelay, Barbe Ranard was to be branded on the shoulder with the
broad arrow. The branding was to take place at once. There was no
chance to go to the Minister or to invoke the assistance of the
Prince de Conti or anyone.</p>

<p>Through the permission of the captain of the gendarmes, with
whom La Salle's gendarme had influence, La Salle was admitted to
the branding by the white-hot iron.</p>

<p>To the hour of his death La Salle could never forget the woman's
face. It was distorted, pale as death, her eyes staring in
terror.</p>

<p>La Salle felt ill, and a sense of degradation entered his soul.
He could only do one thing. He could plead with the captain of the
gendarmes to wait until he has seen the Minister, Seignelay.</p>

<p>Forgetful of his own safety or the peril to himself in going
against the command of the monarch, which he did not fully realize,
to the captain of the gendarmes, he said: &ldquo;In God's name
wait, monsieur. This crime was against me, the Sieur de la Salle. I
wish to beg the Minister of the King to remit this sentence. One
day, one day only!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Until his eyes closed on life and time he could never forget the
woman's face as he made this appeal. In it were amazement and
remorse. Something divine had struck at the farthest corner of her
nature. It soothed her horror.</p>

<p>The captain of the gendarmes shook his head sternly and said:
&ldquo;Not one day, nor one hour. You have no right to speak here.
It is not a question of wrong to you, but to the state of France.
Punishment shall be according to the King's command. You show a
spirit which commends itself to all who feel, but there is
something deeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle broke in: &ldquo;I know, but the deepest thing of all
is not France, but the eternal spirit behind France, behind all the
world. In the name of God, wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face of the captain of the gendarmes hardened. &ldquo;I will
not wait. The garrotte is a Spanish means of death, and her attempt
to bring Spanish crime into France which angered our King. Sieur de
la Salle, be still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle knew the man was right. &ldquo;I will not stay to see
it done.&rdquo; he said, in horror. &ldquo;No, I cannot
stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes met those of Barbe Ranard, and she said to him, not in
words, &ldquo;Go, and because you have done this I shall bear my
punishment better.&rdquo; Her head sank upon her breast.</p>

<p>La Salle, shaken to the innermost, left the room, and as the
door closed he heard the voice of the captain of the gendarmes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<br>

<p>Within an hour the knowledge of these events came to Seignelay,
whose duty it was to explain all to the King. He was fearful of the
result to La Salle, but when next day he met the King, he told him
quietly of what had happened. He did not wish to prejudice His
Majesty against La Salle, but he feared the result.</p>

<p>The usually immobile face of King Louis flushed slightly. His
hand clenched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who dare intervene between me and my will? The man's
a madman and a fool. By God, he shall be branded too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay's reply was calm. &ldquo;Sire, with all respect, he
was neither madman nor fool. It was the Sieur de la Salle! He said
to the captain of the gendarmes who declared it was France and the
spirit of France that imposed the punishment, that there was a
greater spirit behind the spirit of France&mdash;the eternal
spirit. Sire, it is not for me, your faithful servant, to suggest
what judgment Your Majesty should impose, but I beg you assent to
one thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused. With an impatient gesture, Louis said: &ldquo;Before
God, La Salle! La Salle!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sent for La Salle to meet me in the palace here
today. No doubt he is come. I ask but this; that Your Majesty will
hear the talk between La Salle and myself, seated behind that
screen, and impose your judgment, Sire, after you have heard. The
judgment of the God of all the world is like that; He does not
refuse to hear. The King of France represents that eternal
judgment. Will he refuse to hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If there was one thing that impressed Louis in his Minister, it
was the calmness of his logic, and himself had the logician's
spirit. He did not analyze the astuteness of his Minister's
request. After an instant he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it. My judgment will be afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay was too trained a diplomatist to smile; he bowed his
head humbly. &ldquo;Sire, Sire,&rdquo; he said, and that was
all.</p>
<br>

<p>Soon, with the King behind the screen, this conversation took
place between Seignelay and La Salle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sieur de la Salle, you sought to change the judgment of
France upon Madame Ranard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Monseigneur, not that. Crime had been committed
against me. I have seen torture without end in my explorations on
the far continent. I only sought to say some things to you which
might perhaps induce the Grand Monarch to lessen the punishment.
Three times I have been poisoned in New France; twice I have known
my poisoners and have forgiven them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay interrupted. &ldquo;You have forgiven because it was a
matter between you and the criminal, but behind you both was the
State, and the question was whether the State should forgive, not
whether you should forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behind the screen, King Louis, with ears intent, rubbed his
palms together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur, but should the agonies of torture such as
Jesuits have endured be imposed by the State? Let me speak from the
depths of my soul. The Jesuits have persecuted me, tortured me, not
directly, but indirectly, have destroyed my ships and would have
destroyed my life. You say that behind the criminals is the spirit
of the State. I say that behind this criminal is the spirit of the
Jesuits. If the King of Kings must punish, then let him punish the
spirit of the Jesuits, of whom this woman is one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay smiled inwardly. It was the very reply he hoped La
Salle would make. &ldquo;It is the tool that is punished so often,
not the hand behind the tool. I say to you that France is bitter
against you. Who are you? You come of a good burgher
family&mdash;you were at a Jesuit school&mdash;you were educated
for a Jesuit priest&mdash;the King gave you a title of
nobility&mdash;you are one among the millions of the subjects of
France. Why should you step between the executioner and the
criminal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not step between. I am naught but a faithful
servant whose life, since I was among the Jesuits, has been given
for the good of my native land and of my King. But I have something
of the spirit of France, that spirit which is King Louis. God
above! I have offered my life, risked it again and again for
France. It was the soul of France in me made me ask that this
woman, who has pursued me for years, should not suffer the hot iron
on her shoulder. I beg you, try to know what I sought to do. I have
one love, one love only&mdash;the love of my native land; for that
I have striven; for that I am here. I ask that he who is the spirit
of France shall understand me. That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay rose to his feet. &ldquo;I think you will realize,
Sieur de la Salle, that I can promise nothing. You have offended
the head of France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaken, but powerful, and with his head up, La Salle turned to
go. Seignelay followed him and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are coming to the gala at the palace to-night, are
you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the servant of my sovereign, I shall be there,&rdquo;
said La Salle.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXXVIII</h3>

<h3>The Day of Fate</h3>

<p><strong>It</strong> was a day of sunshine, freshness, and gayety
of nature in France. Good news had come to Louis of his armies and
never had his heart been lighter or his faith in France greater.
The courtyards of the Palace of Versailles held many people. He had
returned from the chapel, with a company of bodyguards, preceded by
pages of the court, all gentlemen of birth, and all ambitious and
good-looking. It was their duty to carry candles before the King at
night and to attend him on all his appearances in public.</p>

<p>This was a great day at court for there was to be an embassy
from Siam, and the people of Paris, and the nobility, and the
&ldquo;camp-followers&rdquo; had gathered. When Louis had entered
the palace, followed by members of his family, and nobles among
whom were his Ministers, the Duc d'Alba, M. d'Aumont, first
gentleman of the Chamber, Duc de Grammonet, Comte de Brionne,
Mar&eacute;chal Bellefonds, Duc de Fronsac, Marquis Sourdes,
Marquis de Torcy, Mar&eacute;chals de Vauban and Turenne, and many
others. La Salle entered the courtyard. He was not in high feather;
he was depressed and lonely. With him was the Abb&eacute; de
Renaudot, his faithful friend. As they stood in the resplendent
crowd, nobles and gentry being carried in sedan chairs to the
entrance of the palace, there passed a company of grenadiers in
handsome uniforms, and near the two, three young girls, daughters
of men employed at the palace, sang:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;There is the beauty who
sleeps,<br></span> <span class=
"line6">Oger!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oger!<br></span> <span class=
"line0">There is the beauty who sleeps,<br></span> <span class=
"line6">Oger!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oger!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>This &ldquo;Oger!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oger!&rdquo; was ever the
greeting to the cavaliers. The cavaliers bowed their heads and
laughed, and the girls tossed a scarf towards them. They were
pretty, naive, bouyant, like the day, and yet La Salle was heavy
with gloom.</p>

<p>Then one of the girls began to sing again, looking after the
cavaliers, and presently the others joined in softly. Their voices
were very little raised. They were wholesome, healthy girls, with
knowledge of life:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;When I go to the garden, garden of
love,<br></span> <span class="line0">I think I hear
steps&mdash;<br></span> <span class="line0">I would fly and dare
not.<br></span> <span class="line0">Here is the end of the
day,<br></span> <span class="line0">I fear and I
hesitate,<br></span> <span class="line0">My heart beats
wildly,<br></span> <span class="line0">When I go to the garden,
garden of love.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>They did not realize the full significance of the words. It was
only happy youth in them that sang. None of them was over twenty,
and they were dressed in gay colors and had aigrettes in their
hair, and white stomachers and frilled dresses. La Salle, looking
at them, thought of Lya Darois. She was like them, comprehending
and yet not comprehending, naive, true, wise, with all nature alive
in her, and yet had made friends by her exquisite uprightness and
charm. These girls were like her, but in many ways so infinitely
less. He shook his head sadly, then drew himself together.</p>

<p>They had heard the great cheering as Louis entered his palace,
they had seen the fluttering of handkerchiefs and scarfs, of
saluting hands, and it was as though France stood still to see the
Sun King shine. They were to see stranger things before the day was
over. They must watch the vast crowd until the reception of the
King, to which La Salle looked forward with moroseness.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Renaudot understood, and he did what he could to
cheer him by quiet ascetic remarks on people they saw, and the
troops of soldiers in the vast courtyards. For one who had mingled
so sparsely with the world, the Abb&eacute; had some wit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is more than tinsel, it is the cake itself. This is
the gay music of the august opera of France, which Lulli or
Quinault could not compose. It is France as Louis has made
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle looked at Renaudot with resolute eyes, but did not
speak. Renaudot continued. &ldquo;Every petty German prince tries
to build a Versailles, and our language is spoken in all the courts
of Europe now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now La Salle spoke: &ldquo;King Louis is like the comet of four
years ago. He lightens up the world. It is only of its day. Its day
passes, and the world is no longer dazzled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; laid a hand on La Salle's arm. &ldquo;No, the
light is permanent, it will not pass. King Louis is for all time.
He is France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle stood silent for a moment, then he gave one of his rare
smiles and nodded. &ldquo;Abb&eacute;, you are right. It will not
pass, this light. It is the way of toil and torture, and happiness
and peace.&rdquo; All at once his eyes lighted and a new spirit
entered into him.</p>

<p>Inside the palace King Louis went towards the salon where he
would dine, and in passing spoke to Comte de Brionne, the master of
his stables, where two horses gay with ribbons for him to ride were
kept, and where one hundred English hunters&mdash;the amaze and
wonder of the world&mdash;were housed; to Grammonville, the great
diplomatist; and to Duc de Saint-Aignan, First Gentleman of the
Chamber, who passed the word that the dinner of the Grand Monarch
was to be served. Then Louis stopped and spoke to Mar&eacute;chals
de Boufflers and Duras; to the Duc de Guise, his old boyhood
friend; to M. de Chamillard, Secretary of State; then to an
architect, Coyzevox, and a painter like Lebrun; to the Countess de
Bethune, Princesse de Carignan, Duchesse de Toscane, Madame
S&eacute;vign&eacute;, the accomplished writer, and friendily to
his most severe but admiring critic, the Duc de Saint-Simon. No
face of note escaped him, and all his salutations were marked by
the way he touched or raised his hat. To each a greeting with his
hat according to rank, and to ladies he took off his hat and held
it in his hand while he spoke to them. It was the nature of the
man, not affectation or pretense.</p>

<p>This day Louis had four plates of soup, a whole pheasant,
partridge, a large plate of salad, mutton <i>au jus</i>, two big
slices of ham, a whole plateful of pastry and fruit and hard-boiled
eggs. It was a meal which in these days would quickly send the
stoutest constitution to Vichy or Plombi&egrave;res. The King was
over an hour eating it, and meanwhile he eyed his courtiers with
benign austerity and talked sparingly with the Dauphin.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, Louis rose and summoned Seignelay
and Louvois, his Ministers. &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; he said, with
a finger tossed towards the gardens where the people and his
soldiers were singing and people of Paris were assembling,
&ldquo;all this means well. We are at the summit of my reign. We
have made peace with the Dutch, with the Duke of Brunswick,
Luxemburg, and the Bishop of Munster, and with Sweden. Now
Frederick William of Brandenburg and Charles II of England and
Bishop Francis Egon of Furstenburg are in our pay. Genoa has almost
been destroyed, the Spaniards have been compelled to agree to my
terms. All goes well with us, messieurs. We flourish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They bowed, and he carried his head in pride.</p>

<p>They were going to the Throne Room, the King wearing a
gold-laced coat with large diamonds, which was his way on such
great occasions, and he was now to receive two ambassadors of
Phra-Narai, the King of Siam. It was a scene of unparalleled
splendor. Louis, in his silk stockings and shoes with red high
heels and a long cane, walked as though he were the master of the
world. His long hair was brown and curling on his shoulders, and in
his face was the lofty look of one who counted himself France.</p>

<p>Now as he came to his silver throne he bowed to right and left
and took his seat.</p>

<p>As Louis had said, he was at the apogee of his power and
influence. While he waited for the ambassadors of Siam in the salon
of Apollo&mdash;he talked to the Prince de Conti.</p>

<p>As he had walked he had seen Rose, his Secretary, who for long
years did him service. Rose was neither fat nor lean and had a
taking face and radiantly clever black eyes. He had art, too, and a
real literary touch. He wore a little cloak, a smooth collar, and
satin skull cap over his graying hairs, and was a great judge of
men. Rose wrote many letters for the King, but Louis revised them
all, and his choice of words was worthy of the time when France had
vast distinction in art and letters. To them who served him well
Louis was gracious, and now he summoned Rose and in the presence of
his Court said kind words which were acknowledged with humble
dignity.</p>

<p>Behind his throne was P&egrave;re la Chaise, his confessor, and
near was Harley, the Archbishop of Paris, who had married him to De
Maintenon. Near the throne stood Madame de Maintenon, richly
dressed and looking not more than thirty-five, though she was
forty-eight&mdash;three years older than Louis&mdash;whose marriage
was never formally acknowledged, yet was fully recognized. She was
ever addressed as Madame by members of the Court. Her face was
agreeable, she had a beautiful forehead, eloquent eyes, and a more
graceful carriage than any other lady present. It was a winning
personality, though a little too imposing, but alleviated by her
smile, which was entrancing. She had great purpose, and gave her
life to turning Louis from domestic infelicities. She had influence
on his character, but none upon his policy. Charlotte Elizabeth,
Duchess of Orl&eacute;ans, who stood not far from her, whispered to
a friend, &ldquo;All the Ministers have placed themselves under the
heel of this woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the many guests at the palace were General Du Quesne, and
Liebniz, who had urged Louis to take Egypt; and if he had done so,
the fate of the world would have been different. Napoleon
understood this, but he failed, and Louis had succeeded. Also there
was there the Marquis de Soyecourt, who had been the dear friend of
the infamous but beautiful Lenclos; Despr&eacute;aux, the poet;
Girardon, the sculptor; Princess de Montbazon and Mademoiselle
Nantes, the Comtesse de Fiesque. These were all not far from De
Maintenon, and near her stood the Grand Mademoiselle, the King's
cousin, whom he had never forgiven for turning the guns of the
Bastille on his troops long ago. She was able and powerful in her
way, but had been more than once exiled and now lived at the
Luxemburg in great splendor. She, like the Duchess
d'Orl&eacute;ans, was clever and pointed, and in spite of all had
her way with King Louis in much. She had no love for De Maintenon
and now said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;France has gone far and not stumbled. When will she
stumble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Maintenon, who foresaw the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
though she had dared to speak against it said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Grand Monarch does not stumble. He is France. If
stumbling comes, it will be those near him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well said, old Maintenon,&rdquo; declared Duchess
Charlotte in a whisper to Cardinal Bouillon of Nantes.</p>

<p>At last the Siamese ambassadors appeared, and there were murmurs
of excitement at seeing these representatives of Phra-Narai in
their long robes of silk and glittering swords and peaked hats,
slowly approaching the throne. On being presented they remained so
long upon their knees that Louis, growing impatient, asked his
chancellor, in an undertone if they were never going to rise.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Lyonne interpreted the speeches. Standing up at
last, they said that Phra-Narai had been greatly touched by the
letter from Louis with his miniature. They spoke of commercial
privileges and begged that a French embassy should be sent to
Siam.</p>

<p>Louis welcomed the delegates warmly and said they had done well
to come; that never had France been so powerful. He had an army of
400,000 defended by a hundred fortresses; a huge navy and wealth
greater than that of any other power in the world. He bade the
ambassadors look round and see in this circle of magnificence the
overwhelming character of France. He was pleased that Siam wished
treaty, and he asked if their king would accept the Christian
religion. The chief mandarin, replying, said it would be difficult
for Siam to discard a religion she had held for over two thousand
years, but this was not for him. It belonged to the King of Siam
himself.</p>

<p>Louis then said France's greatness had come under the Christian
religion and no doubt his good brother, the King of Siam, would
sign a treaty to make Siam the greatest country in the Oriental
world.</p>

<p>He bade the mandarins study France and see its vast cathedrals,
and above all Notre Dame; to visit the Louvre and the Tuileries and
the Palais Royale, and his last great work for France; the
H&ocirc;tel des Invalides, where the soldiers of France were cared
for when their fighting was done. He bade them see the vast
fortifications everywhere, the institutions he had founded for the
benefit of France. His ships went to the farthest seas, to the West
Indies, where France owned San Domingo, Martinque, Guadaloupe,
Tabago, Granada, and the Barbados; to America, Africa, Asia and
Siam.</p>

<p>Through the windows of the huge Throne Room came from the
splendid gardens of Versailles a song which softly sounded in the
ears of all:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;This is the day of
France,<br></span> <span class="line0">The day of France, the day
of France,<br></span> <span class="line0">This is the day of
France,<br></span> <span class="line0">Oh, gai, vive le
Roi&mdash;<br></span> <span class="line0">Oh, gai, vive le
Roi!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>When the ambassadors had again made obeisance and retired, Louis
said to Seignelay, &ldquo;La Salle has come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay bowed. &ldquo;Sire, I will send for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Louis beckoned to Harlay, the Archbishop of Paris, who drew
near with anxious eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Archbishop,&rdquo; said King Louis, &ldquo;the progress
of our Faith in France is slow, but it reaches far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Church progresses with you, Sire, its head&mdash;as
far as God permits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well said, Archbishop, but that is within, our borders
here. I am not sure that overseas the Church acts always with its
King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words of Louis filtered through the vast audience as a kind
of subtle irritant. Men and women looked at one another and
murmured. Nobles thrust heads forward, listening intently.</p>

<p>Seignelay's messenger found La Salle in the gardens with the
Abb&eacute; Renaudot. He was summoned to the Presence, and with a
nod he looked curiously at the Abb&eacute; and moved quickly toward
the palace. As they went a lame soldier who had done duty for a
quarter of a century and had but one leg, sang softly&mdash;for he
had come from the Invalides ruled over by the astute Abb&eacute;
Potin.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Brave Captain,<br></span>
<span class="line0">Coming from the war,<br></span> <span class=

</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>With the Abb&eacute; Renaudot not far behind, La Salle, with the
sad song still in his ears, went forward, brooding but
composed.</p>

<p>In the palace La Salle walked behind Seignelay, with head erect,
but with despair in his eyes. He knew not why he had been summoned.
All seemed ill to him. He was pale, almost haggard, and yet he bore
himself with that spirit which had made France the greatest factor
in the world of struggle, strife, exploration, conquest, and
civilization.</p>

<p>La Salle was conscious of the excited spirit of the great crowd,
but as he neared the throne he bowed low. Then as he came closer he
bowed once more and stood still. In Seignelay's face there was
naught of hope. Seignelay had learned immobility.</p>

<p>There was deep silence for a moment, and then Louis said:
&ldquo;Sieur de la Salle, you have come again to my court after
years have passed. You have been on a far continent working for
France. After toil, anxiety, and danger you have discovered the
mouth of the Mississippi. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's face did not change its look, but in his eyes was
amazement, for Louis' tone was kind. &ldquo;When France speaks, who
shall gainsay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Internally the King smiled, for these words gave naught, sought
naught, revealed naught, save an astute and comprehensive mind.
Louis' voice came again, clear and strong:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have destroyed your forts, monsieur, and that
against my will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes startled, looked at Louis with a new sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Fort St. Louis,&rdquo; continued the King, &ldquo;you
have gathered thousands of Indians faithful to you and to that
behind you, the will of France. Come nearer, Sieur de la
Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's face had lost its pallor. A new look came into
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked for two ships; well, I shall give you
four&mdash;one, the <i>Joly</i>, armed with thirty-six guns. You
asked for a hundred men, I shall give you two hundred and fifty,
and, besides, on these ships men and women of France shall go for a
settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi. One of my best naval
captains, Captain Beaujeu, shall go with you. I resolve that Spain
be conquered, and you will bring your Indians down from Fort St.
Louis and we shall break the power of Spain in Mexico. Spain would
rival us, but we are supreme in Europe, and we shall be supreme
over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Louis spoke every pulse of La Salle had pounded life, hope
and vitality back. He could scarce believe that all he asked for
had been granted, and he knew not why, for yesterday Seignelay had
given him no hope. How his future was spread before him! All that
he had planned would come to pass. He raised his head slowly and
moisture came to his eyes. He saw he was expected to reply. He
controlled himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, I have but this to say: Louis, the great, King of
France, by the grace of God, rules. The work you have set me, Sire,
I will do. I will obey the spirit of France in all things. I have
lived for my native land; I have loved her, and to my last moment I
am the faithful son and friend of France. I am the King's loving,
true devoted servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis stretched out a hand, and La Salle knelt and kissed the
fingers which had carried on the work of Richelieu and Mazarin and
Colbert.</p>

<p>As La Salle stood again, King Louis said to all: &ldquo;I would
I had a hundred such as he. The name of France would be
secure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As La Salle drew slowly back and mingled with the excited,
admiring crowd on the way to exit, Seignelay came to him. There was
a look in Seignelay's eyes which said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done, La Salle. The way is now clear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He whispered, however, &ldquo;I knew yesterday what the King
would do, for he heard our talk, Sieur de la Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle's eyes were startled. &ldquo;Name of God!&rdquo; he
said, and that was all.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XXXIX</h3>

<h3>God Knows</h3>

<p><strong>All</strong> Versailles and Paris rang with the triumph
of La Salle. Outwardly he was not changed. His motions were as
deliberate as usual. His walk was firm and quiet, but in his voice
and eyes was the spirit of conquest. He had seen the Abb&eacute;
Potin as he left Versailles, and in the priest's face was the
hatred of one beaten in the struggle for the favor of the King.</p>

<p>Few knew of the branding of Barbe Ranard, but every official of
the Church understood why she had been punished. Weeks passed. She
saw the Abb&eacute; Potin but once since her branding, for a few
moments. She was on her way to the Invalides when she met him in
the street, and stopped him. Looking at her haggard face and
piteous, beautiful eyes, he said, sadly: &ldquo;You have failed.
Henceforth you work no more in the service of our Order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bitterness and revolt were in her heart, but she answered,
quietly: &ldquo;So, only success matters! If that were true,
Abb&eacute; Potin, what of the priests who have given all after
torture.&rdquo; She bowed her head. &ldquo;For me&mdash;for
me&mdash;all is done forever!&rdquo; and she buried her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>When she looked up again the Abb&eacute; was gone, and she would
never see his face as a friend again. His lips she had kissed, upon
his breast her face had lain, but it was all over, and forever, and
she shrank into her dark and everlasting torture.</p>

<p>As she returned slowly to her apartments, her feet heavy as the
gargoyles on Notre Dame, her eyes with all brightness gone, her
soul in dark turmoil, for her husband had been dismissed from his
post in Canada and he had deserted her before her branding; she
shuddered. Every face that looked at her had in her thought stark
reproof. The world turned its shoulders on her, and she knew that
she was alone in the universe. Even Duchesneau never came now. He
had broken with her, the discredited official whom Louis might send
to the Bastille! He, even he to whom she had been so much, turned
his back on her too. Her shoulder was unhealed still, and it gave
her pain as she walked. Voices rang out in the street around her,
songs were sung in caf&eacute;s, and one came to her ears:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;I have to take a long
journey,<br></span> <span class="line0">I don't know who will go
with me:<br></span> <span class="line0">I have to take a long
journey,<br></span> <span class="line0">I don't know who will go

double,<br></span> <span class="line0">La violette,
doubleron.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>Again she shuddered, and her face became tortured. She was no
longer beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must take a long journey,&rdquo; she said in an
agonized voice, &ldquo;and there is no Rossignolette. I am alone.
Oh, God in Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<br>

<p>La Salle's four ships, the <i>Joly</i>, which had thirty-six
guns; the <i>Aimable</i>, with six guns; the <i>Belle</i>, the
direct gift of Louis; and a ketch, <i>St. Fran&ccedil;ois</i>,
loaded with stores and ammunition, tools and implements and things
needed at the mouth of the Mississippi&mdash;all these were at
Rochelle. Here began La Salle's dealings with Captain Beaujeu, whom
he distrusted because Beaujeu's wife was a friend of the Jesuits,
and he could trust no one under their influence. Difficulties
started at once between him and Beaujeu, who wrote protesting
letters to Seignelay.</p>

<p>He said in one letter:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>I find it very hard to submit to the orders of the Sieur de la
Salle, whom I believe to be a man of merit, but who has no
experience of war except with savages, and who has no rank, while I
have been captain of a ship for thirteen years and have served
thirty by sea and land. Besides, he has told me that in case of his
death you have directed that the Sieur, de Tonty shall succeed him.
. . . I beg, Monseigneur, that I may at least share the command
with them.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>Seignelay rebuffed him, told him to have no further anxiety
about the command, for it was settled.</p>

<p>This irritated Beaujeu, who wrote again:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>Monseigneur, I represented to you the hardship of compelling me
to obey Monsieur de la Salle, who has no rank and never commanded
anybody but schoolboys. . . . He pretends that I am only to command
the sailors and have no authority over the volunteer officers and
the hundred soldiers who are to take passage in the <i>Joly</i>,
and that they are not to recognize or obey me in any way during the
voyage. . . . He is a man who wants smoke. I will give him his fill
of it, perhaps more than he likes.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>To his friend, Cabart de Villermont, one of his friends in Paris
with whom La Salle was also on friendly terms, he wrote:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>I do not like his suspiciousness. I think him a good honest
Norman, but Normans are out of fashion. It is one thing to-day and
another to-morrow. . . . Pray do not show my letters for fear of
committing me with him, but he is too suspicious already, and never
was a Norman so Norman as he, which is a great hindrance to
business. I am myself <i>Un bon gros Normand</i>, but I have
traveled far, have seen much, and am broad in mind. I shall go
straight forward without regarding a thousand whims and bagatelles.
His continual suspicion would drive anybody mad except a Norman
like me; but I shall humor him as I have always done, even to
sailing my ship on dry land, if he likes. I could not help telling
him that I saw he was brought up in the provinces. . . Let
Abb&eacute; Renaudot glorify Monsieur de la Salle as much as he
likes, and make him a Cortez, a Pizarro, or an Almagro. That is
nothing to me, but do not let him speak of me as an obstacle in his
hero's way. Let him understand that I know how to execute the
orders of the court as well as he.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>It will thus be seen that Beaujeu was a man of irritable nature,
generous impulses, and distinct capacity. He was round, plump, and
vigorous, with blazing eyes, grayish hair, and a pugnacious nose,
but he was a man through and through, and La Salle could have
trusted him more than he did at the start; but he had been beset by
too much exterior friendliness to accept any man at his own
valuation, and Beaujeu did not lack in self-importance.</p>

<p>Nika, the Indian, servant, with whom La Salle had more in common
than with Beaujeu, one day said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great chief, that captain he not so bad. Him honest fool.
His ways, not yours&mdash;no, but Nika could march with him,
yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at Nika with understanding eyes, and far beyond Nika
into the past out on the great Lakes of the far continent and into
the future with its hoped&mdash;for success, and he smiled and
nodded, but made no reply in words.</p>

<p>Time went on, difficulties arose not only with Beaujeu, but with
the officials who superintended the loading of the ships and
provided the stores&mdash;things done at the expense of the King.
La Salle could not object, but when Louis complained of delay, La
Salle said to Seignelay by letter:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>I am eager to start, but delay comes from official tardiness.
They do not expedite purchase of stores or loading of the ships.
They recruit the soldiers slowly, and not always from the best
class, and I do not wish to take off scourings of the prisons of
France. Be sure, monsieur, that I mean well by my native land and
by the great monarch who has commissioned me.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>Then came a sharp command from King Louis that new officials be
appointed, and they were chosen by Seignelay himself. Then the work
moved on. King Louis became aware that even yet the foes of La
Salle were working.</p>

<p>To Rochelle came Joutel, the son of a gardener, who had once
been in the employ of La Salle's uncle and was a native of Rouen,
had been sixteen years in the army and was to become the honest
historian of the expedition. Father Le Clerc and the Abb&eacute;
Cavelier also wrote, but the Abb&eacute; was at no time an honest
chronicler of his brother's deeds and doings. The Abb&eacute;
Cavelier had arrived in France and come to Rochelle with Moranget,
nephew of La Salle, and another nephew, Cavelier, a schoolboy, to
join the expedition. La Salle's faith in his brother was small, but
this was no time for personal distrust, and he accepted the
Abb&eacute; and also his two nephews.</p>

<p>La Salle said: &ldquo;You have seen me in dark days with death
with in and disaster round me. Now you see my face in the rising
sun, and my life stirring with new purpose. All goes well with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute;'s reply was significant. He was fundamentally
unsound and the good streaks in him were the feeblest muscles of
his whole constitution. He should never have been a priest. He was
La Salle's antithesis, a man with meager face, long nose
acquisitive hands, and attenuated soul. Yet La Salle loved his
captious brother as he loved his devoted mother, to whom he wrote a
letter just before he sailed. These were among his words to
her:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>We are setting sail with four vessels and nearly four hundred
men on board. We all have good hope of a happy success. I
passionately wish, and so do we all, that the success of this
voyage may contribute to your repose and comfort. . . . Madame, my
most honored mother, from your most humble and obedient servant and
son, de la Salle.</p>

<p>My brother, my nephews, and all the others greet you, and take
their leave of you.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>The ships were loaded and they were ready to start, but they
awaited a favorable wind. Louis had at once sent La Forest to Fort
Frontenac, commanding him to take control there, and Tonty to
continue in control at Fort St. Louis on the Illinois. He wrote as
well to La Barre, the Governor, a scathing letter which warned him
that he had lied about La Salle. He concluded with these words:
&ldquo;I am satisfied that Fort Frontenac was not abandoned, as you
wrote to me that it had been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wrote also to the Intendant of Canada, Meulles, that La
Forest was to suffer no impediment and that La Barre was to
surrender to him without reserve all that belonged to La Salle.</p>

<p>A letter has also come from Frontenac, full of delight that La
Salle had triumphantly overcome difficulties, that Barbe Ranard had
been punished, that La Forest had been returned to Canada, and that
the girl, Lya, had been a pivot on which La Salle success had
swung.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>My wife sends you her good wishes and hopes and for myself I
give you, as I always have, my entire faith and deep affection. As
for myself, I shall go to Canada again. Please God, I shall leave
my bones in that great land which in centuries to come shall be the
memorial of endurance, power, and glorious endeavor and
achievement. My hand is on your shoulder, dear La Salle. I bid you
Godspeed.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>On the four ships a goodly sprinkling of gentlemen and women of
the middle and lower class made up the members of the new colony
who were to settle at the mouth of the Mississippi. Among these
were the Marquis de la Sablonni&egrave;re, a noble whose only
fortune was his sword; the Sieur le Gros; Sieur de Merle;
Bartholemy, a young Parisian; Barbier and Talon, Canadians; Liotot,
a surgeon, the brothers Duhaut, Paget, a Huguenot; Heins, a
Wurtemberger, an ex-buccaneer, known as &ldquo;English Jem&rdquo;;
Friar Zenobe Membr&eacute; and others; Recollet Friars and the
priests Esmanville and Desloges; Minet, the engineer; and so many
others.</p>

<p>The day before La Salle sailed, there came to Rochelle with
Madame Louvigny Lya Darois, and he did not know. She did not seek
La Salle, or try to speak with him. She only wished to see him
start upon his long journey, though she did not know it was to be
his last. They must not meet and greet and say farewell.</p>

<p>Standing with Madame Louvigny, she saw him pass to his ship with
firm, quiet tread, Saget, his, servant, and Nika, his Shawanoe
hunter, behind him. The look in his face was that of one who was
entering on his greatest achievement. She knew, as Frontenac had
said, her interview with King Louis had been one of the swivels on
which had swung La Salle's fortunes, and she was glad. In her heart
was that which deepens faith and hope in all mankind. She watched
the evening mists fall upon this little fleet, and she did not know
what its fate would be, but in her heart was an unexplainable
sadness, with sure sense of victory.</p>

<p>She saw night descend and she returned to her apartments with
Madame Louvigny, but next morning at daybreak in a favoring wind
she was out upon the dock with numbers of folk who had come to see
the ships depart. She saw Captain Beaujeu, the Abb&eacute;
Cavelier, and the priests Zenobe Membr&eacute;, Douay, and Le
Clerc. She saw the soldiers and the settlers, the women and girls
who were bidding farewell to friends on shore and were kissing
their hands and waving handkerchiefs in good-bye. She saw La
Salle's face in the distance, the upright resolution of his figure,
the look of command on him, and she said aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great man, great patriot, farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle did not hear this, but he looked at the four ships and
the people on them, and he too felt a strange sadness and an
enormous exhilaration as he gazed into the far distance to the
sky-line beyond which were the Mississippi and Mexico.</p>

<p>The wind caught the sails, they filled, and with the rising sun
upon the canvas they moved upon the infinite sea. Lya did not go
until the ships were almost lost to view beyond the horizon's
line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows&mdash;God knows!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="image">[image: Louis the Fourteenth]</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XL</h3>

<h3>&ldquo;All Shall Be Well&rdquo;</h3>

<p><strong>In</strong> two months after leaving France the four
vessels reached the island of St. Domingo. Here came the first
misfortune of the expedition, owing to the mistake of Beaujeu, who
ran past the Port de Paix and cast anchor at Petit Goave on the
other side of the island. La Salle was indignant, because he wished
to meet the Marquis de Saint-Laurent, Lieutenant-General of the
island, at Port de Paix, B&eacute;gon, the Intendant, and De Cussy,
Governor of La Tortue, who had orders to supply him with
provisions.</p>

<p>La Salle and others of the expedition were ill and the
<i>Joly</i> had more than fifty sick men on board. The <i>Joly</i>
was alone, the other vessels having sailed slowly. A &ldquo;Te
Deum&rdquo; for safe arrival had scarcely been sung, when two of
the delayed vessels came, bringing news that the ketch, <i>St.
Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, had been taken by Spanish buccaneers. She had
carried provisions, tools, and other needs of the colony, and the
loss was irreparable. Not La Salle alone, but the
Lieutenant-General spoke scathingly to Beaujeu, who was answerable
for the loss of the ketch and all that it involved. In vain Beaujeu
protested; they turned and left him, bitter and difficult.
Meanwhile, La Salle's illness increased and he was taken to the
house of a goldsmith in the town, where he lay near to death. The
men of the ships roamed on shore and plunged into excess of
debauchery, contracting dire diseases. Joutel in his journal said,
&ldquo;The air of this place is bad and so are the fruits, and
there are plenty of women worse than either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his bed, La Salle could hear the songs of the evil streets,
and he knew the men were on the broad path to perdition. To his
troubled brain the songs and noise were horrible and disgraceful.
They shouted outside the home where he lay so ill. One of the
chansons struck him like a blow in the face, it was so vile:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;To the Saint Jean I was
welcome,<br></span> <span class="line2">I was welcome for six
francs all round.<br></span> <span class="line0">La vesi, la
veson,<br></span> <span class="line2">La veson don don,<br></span>
<span class="line0">Dancing la vesi,<br></span> <span class=
"line6">Mi!<br></span> <span class="line0">Jumping la
veson,<br></span> <span class="line6">Mon!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>This would be followed by shrieks of laughter, and salacious
mutterings, and ugly little simperings and ejaculations, and the
shame of it all lowered his vitality. He was helpless, he could do
naught, and again the tide seemed against him. Even the Intendant
and Governor did not visit him. They were little better than their
people, and were aware of the strife between La Salle and Beaujeu,
and had no faith in the expedition.</p>

<p>There was a mirror opposite La Salle's bed; it was evening, the
blinds were up, and all was dark in his room. His servant, Saget,
had left him, as he thought, asleep, and had not pulled down the
blinds. La Salle could see the soldiers in the street&mdash;his own
soldiers, sailors, and colonists&mdash;and the negro women and
girls, some of them half dressed, some of them drunk, and all of
them <i>exalt&eacute;</i> in a crude, primitive way. There was an
attempt at a procession in which black and white were one, and
Frenchmen were masked like Indians. It was a melancholy sight for
La Salle to see men of his ships with their arms around black
women. He had seen posts in the far West when Indian girls were
brought in numbers, but the licentiousness of the barbaric West was
not like the shameless abandon of this civilized island under the
French flag.</p>

<p>The men seemed lost in the ribaldry of it all, and among them
was the Marquis de la Sablonni&egrave;re, and Duhaut and Hiens and
Teissier, the pilot, and many others, and La Salle's pulses of
indignation beat faster. To think that a marquis of France should
be in such a crowd! Thank God, none of the women and girls of the
ships were present, for the priests had seen to that, but they had
no control over the men, now that La Salle, the leader, was ill and
Beaujeu was not in command. They had no regard for their leader
when they were in this salacious circle and they were nearly all
drunk.</p>

<p>More than once La Salle in his black misery tried to rise from
his bed to command them to begone. He heard one shrill voice
singing:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;My father married me,<br></span>
<span class="line0">On one of the harvest days, laridon,<br></span>
<span class="line0">He gave me a man who wouldn't listen to
reason,<br></span> <span class="line0">So, laridon, don dame, I
love you!<br></span> <span class="line0">Laridon, don,
don!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>This was sung by a pretty drunken girl of not more than sixteen
years of age, only partially dressed, with lovely neck and shapely
legs, and she now threw herself in the arms of the Marquis de la
Sablonni&egrave;re, whose name was already at a discount in the
expedition. La Salle saw them hurrying up the street, but among the
revelers came Barbier, a young Frenchman born in Quebec, and he
stormed with good round oaths. He asked them if they wished to make
their leader, La Salle, worse that they rioted so near his
sick-room. Had they no feeling, no decency? Were they abandoned
beasts?</p>

<p>It was now that the Abb&eacute; Cavelier and Friar Membr&eacute;
came and with sharp commands drove the crowd away and threatened
them with punishment by the Intendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not on this island now&mdash;ha! ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
they shouted as they ran away, the women and girls gathering their
gay clothes about them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he not say no!&rdquo; said a native girl, sticking
her tongue out as she tossed a skirt at the priests, showing her
bare limbs. She was very young and very bad.</p>

<p>The priests entered La Salle's room and found him excited and
almost delirious. &ldquo;I will stay no longer here. It is
infamous,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; said the Abb&eacute;, &ldquo;we take
you away from this shamelessness to the home of a Capuchin
friar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment Saget and Nika entered and they helped La Salle
to dress. Then he was led shaking from the house, and presently the
Capuchin friar met them in the street, a little godly man of gentle
heart and cheerful eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my home you shall have peace, Sieur de la
Salle,&rdquo; he said, and La Salle liked the man and took his arm,
and the peace promised was his in the friar's home.</p>

<p>The expedition was now without a recognized head, and Beaujeu,
in a letter to Seignelay, told him that La Salle was dangerously
ill; that great numbers were sick; that the Abb&eacute; Cavelier
had asked him to take charge, but he had refused; that the
Spaniards are well armed with six vessels, but that he is not
afraid, and if Sieur de la Salle died he should go a different
course, for he did not approve of his plans.</p>

<p>La Salle could not resume the voyage until near the end of
November, and the stay in the island had been bad for all the men
in the ship. The island had bad government and the place was a
hotbed of vice and evil living. Even the clergy had limited
influence over the soldiers, sailors and colonists. Most had become
demoralized already. La Salle, as he grew better, hoped that the
life at sea would greatly help. He stiffened his courage.</p>

<p>He was ever on ill terms with Aigron, the captain of the
<i>Aimable</i>, whom he had reason to distrust, for Aigron was an
agent of La Salle's foes, who had placed him on the ship in spite
of King Louis' caution. Fearing some mishap might befall the
<i>Aimable</i>, La Salle embarked on her himself with his brother,
Membr&eacute;, Douay, and the trustiest of his followers. On the
<i>Aimable</i> they coasted the shores of Cuba. La Salle meanwhile,
haggard from his recent illness, was buried in meditation, because
of the apparent enmity of Beaujeu and the loss of the <i>St.
Fran&ccedil;ois</i>. Weeks passed. The spirits of nearly all grew
again discontented, for there were three ships, and La Salle could
only be on one where he had influence and he kept his
fellow-passengers fairly contented in spite of Aigron.</p>

<p>At length a sailor at the masthead of the <i>Aimable</i> saw
land, and on New-Year's Day they anchored three league's from the
shore. Then came a thick fog, and when it cleared the <i>Joly</i>
was not to be seen, but La Salle, in the <i>Aimable</i>, with the
<i>Belle</i> explored the coast. He was not aware that they had
already passed the mouth of the Mississippi. At length they came
upon a wide opening between two points of land, and the adjacent
sea was discolored with mud. It was no doubt the entrance to
Galveston Bay. La Salle lay there five or six days, waiting for
Beaujeu. Then thinking that Beaujeu must have passed the
<i>Aimable</i>, he resolved to follow. They coasted the shores of
Texas. Indians swam out and were taken on board, but their language
was not understood, and as he approached the land he saw vast
plains and a dim expanse of forest and prairie and buffalo and
deer. At length he landed between Matagorda Island and Corpus
Christi Bay. Into the lagoons where he was he thought the
Mississippi must empty itself. At last the <i>Joly</i> drew near
and all were encouraged again.</p>

<p>La Salle and Beaujeu met upon the deck of the <i>Joly</i>.
Beaujeu was irritated; the coast was dangerous, the weather bad,
and supplies scanty.</p>

<p>La Salle said to him: &ldquo;I fear we have missed the principal
mouth of the river. I ask you to sail back in search of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu replied that La Salle was to blame for their separation,
but he would Sail back if the ship was given provisions.</p>

<p>La Salle said, &ldquo;I will give rations for fifteen days, no
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu replied: &ldquo;Fifteen days' rations are not enough. I
decline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle retorted, bitterly: &ldquo;Very well. I will land
soldiers and they shall find the chief mouth of the
Mississippi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minet, the engineer, standing by, said he doubted that the
Mississippi discharged into the lagoon at all. La Salle, in his
confusion and uncertainty, resented this, and Minet shrugged his
shoulders and turned away, saying, afterwards, &ldquo;He treated me
as if I were the meanest of mankind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle persisted, and sent Joutel and Moranget with soldiers
to explore the coast.</p>

<p>Joutel in his diary said: &ldquo;The difficulty was that few of
our men were fit for anything except eating. Our company was like
Noah's Ark, which contained animals of all sorts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last they set themselves to build a raft on a good shore into
which a great stream flowed, but before it was finished they saw
the ships which had followed them along the coast. La Salle now
landed, announcing that here was the western mouth of the
Mississippi. He decided to bring the <i>Aimable</i> and the
<i>Belle</i> to safe harborage.</p>

<p>The <i>Aimable</i> was ordered to enter, and she weighed anchor,
La Salle watching her from the shore.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came word to La Salle that the Marquis de
Sablonni&egrave;re with several men had been set upon by Indians
and carried off. The moment was critical; the men must be
recovered. He led his followers in haste towards the camp. There
behind him was the <i>Aimable</i> nearing the shoals. They reached
the Indian huts. As they entered the camp there was a report of
cannon on the seashore. La Salle knew the shot was a signal for
disaster, and, looking back, he saw the <i>Aimable</i> furling her
sails, and knew she had struck a reef. With his followers he
entered the chief's lodge, where the men were naked and the women
nearly so, and an ugly crew swarmed round them. They were given
buffalo meat and dried porpoise meat and pipes to smoke, but La
Salle hastily closed the interview, with difficulty recovering the
kidnapped men, and returning to the beach. On his way he saw the
<i>Aimable</i> on the reef. She contained nearly all the colony's
provisions&mdash;sixty barrels of wine, cannon, grenade, vast
amounts of iron and lead, tools, a forge, a mill, cordage, boxes of
arms, nearly all the medicines, and most of the baggage of the
soldiers and colonists. Aigron had disobeyed orders, and, though
little else was saved, his own personal property was landed
safely!</p>

<p>La Salle had always doubted Aigron, and now he recalled the face
of the Abb&eacute; Potin when he left the palace of Versailles
after being commissioned by the King. He was convinced that the
delays at Rochelle and the sinking of the <i>Aimable</i> were due
to his enemies, who still defeated him in these smaller but
terrible ways. The loss of the <i>St. Fran&ccedil;ois</i> had been
bad, the loss of the <i>Aimable</i> was infinitely worse. He was
convinced that the power which had indirectly tried to kill him had
destroyed the <i>Griffon</i>, ruined Fort Frontenac and strove so
persistently against him, was that which now broke before his eyes
another of his tools to achievement. When Joutel said the boat
which hung at the stern of the <i>Aimable</i> had been staved in,
he was the more convinced.</p>

<p>Beaujeu sent a boat from the <i>Joly</i> and La Salle urged his
men to hasten the saving of the cargo. Gunpowder and flour were
landed. Indians came, greedy for plunder, but all night long
sentinels guarded the miserable bivouac among the casks and boxes
yielded up by the sea, and La Salle, encompassed by treachery,
darkness, and the storm, straightened his shoulders, set his teeth,
and fought on. It was useless to put Aigron under arrest. That
would be done in France, and in time it was so done.</p>

<p>On the morning after the wreck of the <i>Aimable</i>, La Salle,
who believed profoundly in the fidelity of Joutel, said to him:
&ldquo;These are dark days, but I have had darker and may have
darker still. That is the fate of all explorers, of whom I
am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused. He had meant to say, &ldquo;not the most
important,&rdquo; but his inveterate honesty prevented; he felt
beneath all the far-reaching effects of this expedition, no matter
what its present fate. His native land would see that its purpose
was fullfilled. His eyes lighted. He drew his shoulders up and
added to his words. &ldquo;Of whom I am the most opposed, but the
more persistent, Joutel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel's reply was: &ldquo;Many have been against you, Sieur,
but you conquer. You have conquered even Captain Beaujeu. He was
against you at first; he did not believe in you. He thought you
distrusted him. Now he knows what you are, and his energy and
capacity are for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle smiled. &ldquo;We Normans do not long misunderstand
each other. We have a faith of our own, and it makes us greater
patriots. This Captain Aigron&rdquo;&mdash;La Salle's brow
darkened&mdash;&ldquo;is a servant of my foes, and through them
again I have been struck. We are not at the chief mouth of the
Mississippi, I know now, but in the <i>Belle</i> we shall find it,
and there build a fort and start again upon the long path of
France's glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel nodded, and after a moment said: &ldquo;There is great
sickness now, due to brackish water and bad food, and many of our
people have died. The sailors eat wild fruits to excess. Men have
died from diseases caught at St. Domingo. Fifty of our company are
already gone. Besides, we are unsafe here with the Indians near and
the Spaniards possible. We are defenseless in some
sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle replied: &ldquo;I understand. We must make a rampart to
protect the camp.&rdquo; Here, among bales, boxes, casks, and pens
for fowls and swine, were gathered the sorrowful men and women who
came to hold for France a region larger than half of Europe, and
they built a fort under the eye and with the help of La Salle.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the settlement grew. There were quarters for
the women and the men, and a small chapel was built, and at length
a sort of village became evident and Indians came and traded, and
gardens were planted, and men hunted and women and girls sewed and
gave a sense of settled life to the transitory place. It was all
lonely, but not secluded. Vast plains stretched behind them, a wide
and beautiful sky was above them, and they were free from all
danger of cold and only the bad water was their foe in the daily
life. Wells were sunk, but still the water was brackish, and there
was food in plenty from the prairie, and oysters from the beds near
by, and, had it not been for discordant elements, all would have
seemed in some degree promising.</p>

<p>Never did priests behave better than on this expedition. Not one
of them but would have cut off his hand rather than have gone back
to France with Beaujeu. They went among the people guiding,
encouraging, hopeful, sustaining. They had the social gifts of
women, the piety of saints, the adaptability which was so needed in
the pioneer life. They had the primitive sense. Some of them came
of high lienage in France, they were ever faithful and useful,
advising well, attending the sick, administering to the dying, and
burying the dead. Their cassocks might be worn and frayed, but
their vestments of the Mass were ever clean and rich and beautiful,
and attendance at Mass was a comfort to those whose clothes were
becoming worn and grimy, and not easily renewed, for much cloth had
been lost in the <i>St. Fran&ccedil;ois</i> and the
<i>Aimable</i>.</p>

<p>It was hard to imagine that this expedition would prove in the
end a failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we lose faith in our great star, La Salle.&rdquo;
said the wife of a dissident mason. &ldquo;But no, he may not
always succeed, but he triumphs as he has always done. I am for
standing steady&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Zut!</i> the man is a wonder for sure,&rdquo; said a
builder from Rochelle, &ldquo;I take my compass from his
pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drink to him,&rdquo; said a laborer who had a bottle of
wine for his dinner. &ldquo;This is good enough for me. We have
enough to eat, and if the water ain't good, then drink wine, say I.
<i>Parbleu</i>, drink wine, say I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father Le Clerc, in passing, said, &ldquo;The wine of life for
you, my friend, and don't forget that, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laborer made the sign of the cross. &ldquo;That's my answer,
<i>pardieu!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the whole the settlement was very busy, for La Salle realized
that only by work could discontent be diminished, and Joutel, his
faithful friend, fought his fight with understanding heart.</p>

<p>One of the wives of the settlers came to Joutel. &ldquo;You
think we shall come through this all right, M. Joutel? Are we at
the mouth of the Mississippi. Is it now&mdash;that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the Sieur de la Salle would rest until the
expedition was a success? But no, madame, we are on the way to
happiness. Be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman smiled. &ldquo;You are like the priests, M. Joutel;
you make us believe the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am like a priest that is good for me. If they
believe, trust them, and all will come right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right&mdash;yes, <i>comme ci, comme ca</i>,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>

<p>A girl went by singing:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;We were ten girls in a
meadow<br></span> <span class="line0">All ten waiting to
marry,<br></span> <span class="line0">There was Diane, there was
Chine,<br></span> <span class="line0">There was Claudine, et
Martine,<br></span> <span class="line0">Ah, ah, Cath'rinette et
Cathrina&mdash;<br></span> <span class="line0">Finally they sent us
away,<br></span> <span class="line0">All were sent away,<br></span>
<span class="line0">Drove away, Diane,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">Drove away Chine&mdash;ah!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>The woman laughed. &ldquo;There is spirit for ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel exclaimed: &ldquo;<i>Comme ci, comme ca</i>,&rdquo; and
he laughed.</p>

<p>As time passed disaffection grew. There were, from the first,
discordant elements. These became vocal. Such men at Liotot, the
surgeon, the brothers Duhaut, Hiens, Teissier, the pilot, young
Barthelemy, and one or two others sought to increase the
disaffection. They moved about sowing discord, unmindful of the
fact that without La Salle the project must wholly fail. They were
never successful among the few women, with whom La Salle was
popular, and the priests, aware of the conspiracy, did their best
to stem it, though they did not speak of it to La Salle. They were
loyal from first to last, and admired and loved him. They succeeded
in preventing the worst.</p>

<p>Said Friar Membr&eacute;, head of the priests on the expedition,
to Father Esmonville, &ldquo;We must cheer the settlers, or all
will be hopeless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Esmonville replied, &ldquo;We are in the hands of God&mdash;it
shall be well with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His cassock was torn and mended; he was lean and ill fed, for
the water was poor and many were ill because of it, but he held
himself, as did all his colleagues, with heroic dignity. His
sunburnt face showed little, but it had a look of patient hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naught can come of naught,&rdquo; said Duhaut, passing
them with a sarcastic smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not know the word,&rdquo; said Friar
Membr&eacute;.</p>

<p>It became known that the Indians had set fire to the prairie,
meaning them ill, but La Salle caused the grass to be cut about the
camp, especially near where the powder was. Then the Indians stole
and carried things away.</p>

<p>La Salle sent his nephew, Moranget, and others to reclaim them,
which they did, and they seized canoes and made slow progress back.
They were attacked by Indians at night and two men were killed, and
Moranget was wounded by an arrow through the arm.</p>

<p>When they returned, La Salle sternly reproved Moranget and
placed him in the hands of Liotot, the surgeon. Liotot detested
Moranget, as he saw how selfish and mean he was and how little
likely to help La Salle. Liotot had invested money in the
expedition and was eager for its success.</p>

<p>At last Beaujeu, who in the <i>Joly</i> was slowly coming to
understand La Salle and did all possible to help him, prepared to
return to France. His ship was in danger on this exposed coast and
he was anxious to find shelter. Two days before the wreck of the
<i>Aimable</i> he had said to La Salle: &ldquo;I wish you to have
more confidence in me. I will always make the first advances and I
will follow your counsel whenever I can do so without risking my
ship. If you wish, I will go to Martinique for provisions and
reinforcements. There is nothing I am not ready to do. You have
only to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle replied with emotion: &ldquo;I am proud of your
confidence. I ask you to send ashore a quantity of iron stowed in
the <i>Joly</i> for the use of the colony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu shook his head sorrowfully: &ldquo;It is almost
impossible save in harbor, for it is on my ballast and under my
spare anchors and all my stowage. It will take days to get it here
where the sea runs like mountains when the slightest wind
blows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this La Salle replied: &ldquo;I am near the place I sought;
my expedition will succeed if I can have the iron stowed on board
the <i>Joly</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu shook his head in negation and his round face seemed
troubled, but after some further talk, a glass of wine and a
biscuit, while the <i>Joly</i> scorched in the sun, and seagulls
fluttered and sailors quarreled, La Salle returned to shore.</p>

<p>Beaujeu looked after him with admiration and said to himself:
&ldquo;We Normans must stand together. The man is wholly to be
trusted. He is a great patriot and gives all for the love of our
native land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he sent for his lieutenant, Aire. &ldquo;I shall get
out the iron for La Salle. See that it is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aire's face clouded and he said, &ldquo;In this uncertain
sea?&rdquo; Beaujeu hardened. &ldquo;Carry out my commands. There
is naught to fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu now wrote to La Salle:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>I have ordered your iron to be got out in spite of my officers,
who tell me I endanger my ship. I will bring provisions from
Martinique. My work is over, the settlers are landed, and your
responsible work begins. With all my heart I wish you well, my good
Norman comrade.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>When La Salle received this letter he said to Joutel: &ldquo;You
are right. Now our way seems clearer, and Beaujeu will carry the
good news that my work is well begun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel raised an arm in salutation. &ldquo;Good master, all
comes your way in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last La Salle bade good-by to Beaujeu on the shore. With
great respect Beaujen had come to say farewell, and in the wretched
camp, with its poor ramparts and surrounded by oyster beds and
broad flats of mud, the farewell took place with all the colonists
present. Some had lost heart and nine embarked for home with
Beaujen. Among these was Minet, the engineer.</p>

<p>This bright day, the sun shining, the mists clearing, the waters
of the great Gulf rippling in the light (for there was no
roughness), faced by the departure of the <i>Joly</i>, La Salle
smiled upon his followers, then swept the land in a vast semicircle
with an outstretched arm:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This land, Captain Beaujeu, will bring honor and great
prosperity. Spain shall be conquered in Mexico, and France shall be
triumphant there and here. Take with you the message of our hope
and love. To Monseigneur Seignelay please say all shall end well
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Beaujeu's eyes was not the light of confidence, save in La
Salle himself. &ldquo;I shall take to France, Sieur, my faith in
you and in your vast energy and patriotism and administration.
Hardships lie before you, but prosperity shall come. It is a great
land and I shall speak of it well and warmly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were dressed in the best they had, La Salle in his laced
scarlet coat, Beaujeu in the uniform of the navy, which had
distinction and handsomeness, and behind Beaujen were his officers
in showy uniforms. Behind La Salle were his chief men, all dressed
in their best&mdash;laces and ribbons and swords, and all the women
and girls in their gayest clothing in the bright sun. It was
outwardly promising.</p>

<p>When Beaujeu entered his small boat he was acclaimed, and there
were tears and waving handkerchiefs of the women, but in the eyes
of some behind La Salle were anxiety and the glimmer of tragedy.
They watched the <i>Joly</i> disappear, and as they turned to the
camp again one of the chief men was bitten by a snake in the ankle,
and though Joutel killed the snake, a sudden depression went
through the crowd. They were superstitious and this was like a
warning.</p>

<p>La Salle turned again to where he could see the tips of the
sails of the <i>Joly</i>. He laid a hand upon his sword. &ldquo;All
shall be well,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>A pretty young girl heard him and she shook her head and said to
Barbier, &ldquo;Shall all be well, m'sieu'?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbier, a good colonist, looked at her forlornly, but made no
reply at first. The girl's name was Babette Laroque. She came from
La Salle's old home, Rouen, and she was of the lower middle-class,
with an intelligent mind, and in her was the rare spirit of
adventure and travel which few women have. She had come because she
had a brother of whom she was fond and they were orphans, and when
he said he would go with the expedition, she willed to go with him;
and she was heart free when she started, but was not heart free
now.</p>

<p>From the first she had liked Barbier, who was a man of men and
as loyal to the expedition as though it was his own, and an intense
admirer of La Salle, in whom he ever believed.</p>

<p>At last, as he walked with Babette and they turned and watched
the <i>Joly</i> grow smaller as she sailed, he said: &ldquo;If La
Salle says it shall be well, then we must believe, but to be
<i>well</i> has many meanings. He has the big view his well may not
be ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her head swiftly and she said, &ldquo;Well, and well,
and well&mdash;haven't we the big view, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and looked into her deep-blue eyes. &ldquo;You give me
hope, Babette.&rdquo; This was the first time he had called her by
her Christian name.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XLI</h3>

<h3>Two Women</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>So</strong>, Captain Beaujeu, you come from the
mouth of the Mississippi, where you left the Sieur de la
Salle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Beaujeu to Seignelay,
&ldquo;I am not sure I left Sieur de la Salle at the mouth of the
Mississippi&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay lifted his eyebrows and said, sternly, &ldquo;If not
the mouth of the Mississippi, then where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu, though frightened by the sarcastic voice of the
Minister, tried to fortify himself. &ldquo;I am a Norman,
monseigneur, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay interrupted: &ldquo;That touches not the point. You
are a Frenchman. Where did you leave La Salle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujen wilted before the hard voice and said: &ldquo;I know
not, but it was not the mouth of the Mississippi discovered by the
Sieur de la Salle, and not only I, but Monsieur Minet, the
engineer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay interrupted: &ldquo;Oh, Minet the engineer! Then by
the Heaven above, in the confinement to which I shall assign him
Monsieur Minet shall have time to think why he deserted La Salle.
Go on, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu was now thoroughly upset, but he controlled himself and
said: &ldquo;Monseigneur, the Sieur had never seen the Mississippi
from the sea. I am sure we passed it and came to the mouth of a
river further west, which also has lagoons and mud flats. I do not
think Sieur de la Salle himself believes he has found the
Mississippi mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something like satire filled the quiet but severe face of the
Minister. &ldquo;So much for that, then. Why did you leave the
Sieur de la Salle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the <i>St. Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, the ketch, had
been wrecked at Saint Domingo and it contained tools and
ammunitions, and the <i>Aimable</i> was wrecked and it contained
provisions and other things needful for the colony, so it was that
I left&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay intervened again: &ldquo;The ketch, St.
Fran&ccedil;ois, was wrecked and the <i>Aimable</i> was wrecked.
Where is Aigron, captain of the <i>Aimable?</i> France would lay
hands upon him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu told him Aigron's address in Paris.</p>

<p>In Seignelay's mind was the belief that the <i>Aimable</i> had
been purposely wrecked and that behind the false captain was what
prevented the quick loading of the ships at Rochelle, the power of
the Jesuits. His lips compressed, his eyes grew cold with
indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, what more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sieur de la Salle needed iron and provisions, and so
I made for Cuba to get him both; but head winds were against me. My
crew were discontented, and so I did not touch at Cuba but came
direct to France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaujeu almost sank through the floor before the anger in the
eyes of the Minister.</p>

<p>Seignelay looked at him for a moment without speaking, and then
these harsh words came: &ldquo;Captain Beaujeu, as master of your
ship why should discontent stop you from doing your duty. Does,
then, a captain of the navy of France kneel before the will of his
crew?&rdquo; Seignelay got to his feet. &ldquo;By God! I would
rather see the ship sunk, and you with it, than that you should
come to France with this dastardly tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had finished, Beaujeu's face was haggard.
&ldquo;Monseigneur, I did my duty after the light given me. On my
word of honor, at last I acted to the Sieur de la Salle as I would
to my own brother. His greatness conquered me and I came to respect
and love him. He was worth all of us put together&mdash;an explorer
without parallel, a patriot without measurement. I take back every
word I ever said against the Sieur de la Salle. At last I gave him
all I had, the best that was in me. The man conquered me.&rdquo;
There were tears in his eyes, his head drooped.</p>

<p>Seignelay looked for a moment, then placed a hand upon his
shoulder. &ldquo;Captain Beaujeu, that redeems you in my eyes. What
you have said I believe, but you must not repeat elsewhere your
uncertainty as to the mouth of the Mississippi. It should not reach
the ears of the King, who sent this expedition at his own expense.
Captain Beaujeu, the Bastille was for you, but your words assure me
you are an honest man and a faithful servant of the
King&mdash;according to your lights&mdash;not the lights of Heaven!
You have an obtuse but an honest mind. Now get you gone, Captain
Beaujeu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With tears streaming down his cheeks, Captain Beaujeu said:
&ldquo;Monseigneur, with all my soul I thank you. God preserve the
Sieur de la Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words he left the room and Seignelay watched him go
with unhappy premonition of La Salle's defeat. He sat slowly down
and thought. The <i>St. Fran&ccedil;ois</i> had been lost, the
<i>Aimable</i> had been lost, and there was some black conspiracy
behind it all. Minet and Captain Aigron! He took a pen, wrote an
order, blotted the ink, and rang a bell. His secretary
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is for the arrest of Minet, the engineer who went
with the Sieur de la Salle, and Captain Aigron. Have them brought
to my office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The secretary bowed and retired, and Seignelay made his way to
King Louis.</p>

<p>He told King Louis of the loss of the St. Fran&ccedil;ois and of
the <i>Aimable</i>, at which King Louis' eyes and face grew stern
and hard, and of the return of Captain Beaujeu and Minet, the
engineer. He did not tell Beaujeu's suspicions about the mouth of
the Mississippi, but he spoke well of Beaujeu and harshly of Minet
and Aigron, who had deserted La Salle and returned to France.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence King Louis said: &ldquo;Captain Beaujeu
did his duty, I suppose. But why did these men desert their master,
La Salle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, I ordered the arrest of Minet and Aigron, believing
it Your Majesty's will. I took the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment Louis said, &ldquo;You believe that La Salle will
succeed, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an instant's pause, and then Seignelay said: &ldquo;He
has never yet failed, Sire, but has done honor to you who are his
country. All will come right to the Sieur de la Salle&mdash;all in
time. In him I have unchangeable faith and hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Louis' face lighted. &ldquo;This I like to hear. That vast
new empire must conquer Spain in Mexico. That was why I sent La
Salle. Settlement there, and the conquest of Spain. Now, Seignelay,
what are your latest news from Quebec?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very worst, Sire. The Iroquois are more than
troublesome and De la Barre has failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave La Barre warning, and now he shall
retire&mdash;the useless one! In his place I will send Denonville,
a better man. He may succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, do you not think that Count Frontenac should
return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louis smiled now. &ldquo;If Denonville does not succeed I can
turn to Frontenac and say: &lsquo;Go back to the land where you
ruled so well&mdash;yes, in spite of all&mdash;conquer the vile
Iroquois, and lay the stable base for the future of my
Canada.&rsquo;&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;Frontenac is poor. I will
send him three thousand livres. So he will know I have forgiven him
and he will have patience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seignelay bowed his head. France was greater than she had been
in all her history, and it was due to this sage being who, like all
great men, made mistakes, but did his own thinking, played his own
great part, and loved France more than aught else in all the
world.</p>
<br>

<p>Rojet Ranard had been recalled from Quebec, and at first lived
with his beautiful, dejected, humiliated wife in complete seclusion
in Paris. Then he left her forever, as Duchesneau had done, and she
lived alone. No old friends visited her, for the shame of her
punishment had gone abroad.</p>

<p>On the day that Lya Darois, with Madame Louvigny, returned to
Canada, she and the girl met. It was in the street where La Salle
had lived&mdash;La Truanderie&mdash;for Lya had come to see where
he had defeated the garrotters at the door of his apartments. She
looked at it as though while life remained the picture of it would
stay in her mind.</p>

<p>Barbe Ranard had not passed through this street since her own
tragedy, but as a murderer comes again to the scene of his crime,
so she had been drawn against her will to the spot where the great
explorer had defeated her murderers. She went with bowed head, and
was astounded to meet Lya coming from the door where La Salle had
been the cause of her banishment from all civilized life. For a
moment they looked at each other and then Barbe Ranard said,
bitterly, &ldquo;So, mademoiselle, you come to see where Sieur de
la Salle made my tragedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madame. I came to see the home where lived in anxiety
one of the noblest men God ever gave the world. I had no thought of
the crime committed here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The honesty of her eyes and the sweet beauty of her face
conquered this lost woman, as La Salle had conquered her at her
branding. For a moment she looked at Lya without speaking. Then she
turned gravely away, weeping, and walked swiftly to her own home.
Lya watched her go with pity in her heart, for the woman had paid
her price.</p>

<p>That night when the clocks struck twelve Barbe Ranard in her
lonely room walked up and down in misery. As in her terrible shame
she walked, now a little bent to one side as though her seared
shoulder still hurt her, and her lips moaning and her body
trembling, she raged in impotency. She had had place and even
power; she had none now. Pictures of Versailles, of Quebec, of
Paris in days past came to her mind's eye, and they tortured her as
no martyr had ever been tortured by natives in the frozen wastes of
Canada. Now there came to her sounds of singing from the
street:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Pass, pass, Tribonet,<br></span>
<span class="line0">Through the door of Saint-Jacquet,<br></span>
<span class="line0">Pass, pass, Tribonot,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">Through the door of Saint-Jacquot.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>As she listened she shook her head and said: &ldquo;&lsquo;Pass,
pass, Tribonot!&rsquo; Yes, that is it&mdash;to Saint Jacquot!
There is naught left for me. Even Duchesneau deserted me and he is
in confinement. All my friends are gone forever. O God, I am
alone&mdash;all alone! No one cares now.&rdquo; She suddenly stood
still and tore open her gown, exposing her bare breasts.
&ldquo;They are beautiful still,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but none
shall ever kiss them now. Behind them is the mark of the red-hot
iron!&rdquo; She gave a frenzied laugh. Again she walked, swaying
from side to side. The clock of a church now began to strike, and
the words of a chanson came to her:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Orleans, Boisgency,<br></span>
<span class="line2">Notre Dame of Clery,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">Vendome, Vendome,<br></span> <span class="line2">What
sorrow, what a bore,<br></span> <span class="line0">To count all
the night,<br></span> <span class="line2">The hours, the
hours!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>That was it&mdash;&ldquo;to count all the night, the hours, the
hours!&rdquo; No, she could hot do it&mdash;no! It was too black,
too awful. &ldquo;What sorrow, what a bore!&rdquo; She ran to a
cupboard and took out a bottle of poison. Pouring out some, she
added a little wine and, looking round the room, so loathsome to
her eyes, with a sudden cry she closed her eyes, raised the glass,
and drank her own eternal silence.</p>

<p>Then she knelt upon the floor blindly, her brilliant eyes
opened, glazing with torture. For a moment or two she swayed, her
fingers closihg and unclosing, at last raised in agonized prayer,
and then she fell. There in the ghostly silence she lay still, the
light burning until morning. And the life in the streets went
on.</p>
<br>

<p>Lya landed in Quebec with Madame Louvigny and was met with
honor, for news had come of her reception by King Louis, of how she
had helped in the success of La Salle, and of the favor shown by
distinguished folk in France; though certain members of the Sainte
Famille were still secretly bitter against her.</p>

<p>As she and Madame Louvigny came to the cathedral to Mass, little
groups of people gathered to see them pass. Never before had Mass
seemed so comforting to Lya. She had in her pocket a letter from
Henri de Tonty.</p>

<p>Denonville, the new Governor, had come from France, and Tonty
had received a letter from him. This was Tonty's letter to her; it
was in her pocket as she attended Mass:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>Dear Mademoiselle: I regret I have bitter news. I was displaced
by La Barre, the Governor, from command of Fort St. Louis on the
Illinois, but I was reinstated by the King, and, having had word
from Denonville, the new Governor, of the loss of the
<i>Aimable</i>, the return of Beaujeu, the arrest of Aigron, the
captain of the <i>Aimable</i>, and Minet, I determined to go to La
Salle. So I gathered twenty-five Frenchmen and eleven Indians.
Leaving here, I swiftly descended the Mississippi, where I had been
with La Salle, and reached its mouth in Holy Week. I came upon
loneliness and desolation. There were no white men on river, marsh,
or sea. I sent canoes to search the coast for many leagues, but
found no trace of La Salle, so I wrote him a letter, leaving it in
charge of an Indian chief, hoping he would receive it at some time.
I cannot tell you with what sorrow I ascended the Mississippi, some
of my men remaining at the villages of Arkansas, Couture, Delaunay,
and four others.</p>

<p>One thing, alas, seems clear, that La Salle missed the mouth of
the Mississippi, and is no doubt in territory farther west which
from the sea resembles the Mississippi mouth. He must be in a sad
way, for he lacks tools and food and stores, but in the past he has
overcome all obstacles, no matter how tremendous. I doubt not the
end will be all we can desire, but it may not be soon. I must
consolidate the work he so splendidly began here. The Iroquois are
troublesome, but I have other tribes whom La Salle conquered by his
indomitable soul, and here, at Fort Frontenac, at Michillimackinac,
and elsewhere they will be kept ready to resist attack but no
permanent good will come to this vast region, unless Frontenac
returns. Everything depends on that. The great <i>coureur de
bois</i>, Du Lhut, a cousin of Louvigny, will take this letter to
you. He is a man of worth and enormous skill in trade and with the
Indians, and a gentleman in all. He takes this to you with the
loving respect and timeless admiration of</p>

<p>HENRI DE TONTY.</p>
</div>
<!--end of letter-->

<p>Lya had not yet seen Du Lhut, but the letter from Tonty had been
left with Monsieur Louvigny, and she read it with mournful heart,
for she realized that all was not well with La Salle.</p>

<p>In vain Madame Louvigny sought to cheer her; an unexplainable
pathos was in her eyes and around her lips. She read again with how
proud and, strangely enough, how happy a heart, the words,
&ldquo;With the loving respect and timeless admiration of Henri de
Tonty.&rdquo; It sent her to sleep that night depressed and yet
elated, sorrowful in anticipation of bad news, but hopeful.</p>

<p>Next night at dinner she met the big and adventurous Du Lhut,
but he knew no more than Tonty had told him and he had learned in
Quebec, but he was high in praise of La Salle and in admiration of
Tonty. &ldquo;He has a metal hand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but his
heart is of true metal also. The hand can kill, but the heart can
save. He is a man of a million!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was in Du Lhut the wide spirit of a man without jealousy,
without smallness, without malice; trusted, beloved, criminal if
you will, but a great man after his kind. There was no Governor but
spoke well of him. It was only the Intendants who persecuted him,
and they, like Duchesneau, were rivals in trade, or, like Ranard,
were corrupt officials.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me, monsieur,&rdquo; said Lya, her eyes
intent on his, &ldquo;whether the Iroquois are likely to
conquer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three watched closely the face of Du Lhut. It grew somber,
but behind the somberness there was the light of hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are powerful, the Iroquois. The Indians of the West
cannot stand against them, for they are not combined as the Six
Nations are. I do not say they will take Quebec, because it is not
the destiny of this vast estate to be under the rule of the
heathen. The lives of Jesuit priests and Recollets&mdash;how
many&mdash;are proof that the white man has come to
stay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He suddenly got to his feet and both hands went up. &ldquo;By
the souls of all the saints it shall not be. Frontenac must return.
With him, all shall be safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked the room for a moment, excited, dominant, then sat
down again with a little laugh. &ldquo;We primitive people are
easily roused but not easily conquered . . . and a little more of
that excellent rago&ucirc;t, my cousin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lya watched him, and her figure trembled with happy agitation.
For long they talked, though Lya little. She watched and listened,
and when Du Lhut kissed her hand in good-bye she suddenly said:
&ldquo;May I kiss you, monsieur? May I kiss you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her hands on his shoulder and kissed each cheek. With
his arms he drew her close: &ldquo;God be good to you, my
dear,&rdquo; he said. The Louvignys smiled. They loved the
girl.</p>

<p>Outside in the hallway, where he would not let them
come&mdash;for he hated this sort of formality; to his mind it was
enfeebling&mdash;Du Lhut was faced by Luce Hontard who happened to
pass to the staircase. He stopped her and he learned by shrewd
questioning of this noble soul, fat, faithful and silent, that Lya
had enough to live on humbly but comfortably all her days.</p>

<p>Du Lhut laughed. &ldquo;She kissed me, Luce Hontard, just now.
May I kiss you, good woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, m'sieu', m'sieu'! Oh, la! la!&rdquo; she said, and he
kissed her on both cheeks and on the lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Time be good to us all,&rdquo; he said, and a moment
later he was in the street with a new pulse of adventure and hope
in his veins.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XLII</h3>

<h3>In the Hour of Trial</h3>

<p><strong>On</strong> the last day of October La Salle started
with fifty men to find the mouth of the Mississippi, and they were
saluted by cannons and were cheered as they started. Some wore
corselets made of staves to ward off arrows, and they descended the
La Vache, where La Salle had built a temporary post. It was two
leagues above the mouth of the river and Joutel was in command.
Lodgings were built for the women and girls, separate lodgings for
the men, a small chapel was added, and the whole was palisaded. At
the four corners of the house were mounted pieces of cannon and all
the surrounding prairie swarmed with game&mdash;buffalo, deer,
turkeys, ducks&mdash;there were plenty of turtles in the river and
the bay was full of oysters.</p>

<p>Yet death, meanwhile, made withering havoc among La Salle's
followers. Many of the soldiers were useless, nearly all fell ill,
and the graveyard received more than thirty tenants that summer.
The new post was given the name of Fort St. Louis. Under the eye of
La Salle the men had worked hard. The carpenters brought from
Rochelle proved worthless and La Salle himself had made the plans
of the work and directed the whole.</p>

<p>After La Salle's going Joutel kept all at work, for busy folk
had not time for disillusion. Plenty of buffalo were killed. A
scaffold was built near the fort and all were set to work to smoke
buffalo meat against the day of scarcity.</p>

<p>Autumn passed and January came, but without snow or bitter
weather, for it was far south. One day from the opposite side of
the river came a shout of, &ldquo;Dominic!&rdquo; One man was in a
canoe, and as it came near Joutel recognized the elder, Duhaut, the
rascal who had gone with La Salle. Duhaut, well born, had deserted
La Salle, but to Joutel he falsely said he had stopped to mend his
moccasins and, trying to overtake the party, had lost his way. He
had fired his gun to no answering shot, and under great hardship he
returned to Fort St. Louis. Dominic was his younger brother.</p>

<p>Time dragged on and at last Joutel saw seven or eight men
approaching. La Salle headed them. They were greeted with joy by
all, but La Salle, seeing Duhaut, asked why this deserter had been
received. Then the wily and clever Duhaut explained, and La Salle's
anger at length grew less.</p>

<p>La Salle had come upon a large river which he at first mistook
for the Mississippi, and building a palisaded fort, he left there
several of his men whose fate was now unknown to him. He found he
was mistaken about the river. After long search he had at length
returned slowly to Fort St. Louis.</p>

<p>Presently La Salle was taken ill. His strength had been
overcome, but not his courage or fortitude. In the fort he could
command the care of all whom his brother, the Abb&eacute;, and
Joutel, would let come to him. Liotot, the surgeon, looked after
him, not loving him, but doing his duty. He had money in the
expedition, and in France had not been a bad man, but here in the
wilds a crude strain in him showed, and he was now disappointed and
surly. Yet their only safety lay in keeping La Salle alive now, and
Liotot admitted to himself that no man ever in this hemisphere had
proved so great as La Salle.</p>

<p>As he lay sick, and at times delirious, due to over anxiety and
a sense of bitter mistake, he had visions. As a rule La Salle
preferred to be waited on by men&mdash;by Saget and Nika, who loved
the ground he trod&mdash;but Liotot urged that one of the women of
the expedition should come to his room. She was a woman of about
forty-five, a mother, and of the lower middle class, and she was
swift and gentle in her ways.</p>

<p>La Salle was but dimly aware of her presence, and why she was
there he did not know. One night she came out of the dark with a
lantern and La Salle in semi-delirium said:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;The poor woman,<br></span>
<span class="line0">She is the wife of a carter,<br></span>
<span class="line0">She goes all about the country,<br></span>
<span class="line0">From tavern to tavern,<br></span> <span class=
"line0">Searching for her husband,<br></span> <span class=
"line6">Tirelli,<br></span> <span class="line0">With a
lantern.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>The woman was the widow of a man who had died on the expedition
and for an instant her eyes gazed wildly at La Salle. She saw,
however, that he was delirious and her distress abated. She put out
the lantern, went to his bed, lifted up his head, and gave him a
cup of soup to drink. He nodded at her kindly and she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;God save you to us, exalted man!&rdquo; Then she made the
sign of the cross, and presently sat down and watched him, with
Nika standing near.</p>

<p>La Salle had visions again, but now with eyes closed. He dreamed
he was in vast fields of settlement at the mouth of the
Mississippi, and he saw oxen in the fields, and at the threshings,
and all was prosperity. He remembered the splendid work done by the
farmers of France, and with quivering voice said:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="line-1">&ldquo;Thresh out for
yourselves,<br></span> <span class="line2">Thresh out for
yourselves,<br></span> <span class="line6">Oxen.<br></span>
<span class="line0">Thresh out for yourselves,<br></span>
<span class="line2">Thresh out for yourselves,<br></span>
<span class="line0">Many bushels for your
masters!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<!--end of verse-->

<p>His was a strange elation in the leader of an expedition which
had not in some ways justified itself in its time, but was for all
time. Death and disaster had followed it, yet here was its sick
leader exultant in his dream. He saw in prophetic vision the
fulfillment of his hopes, and these lines are written not so far
from the spot where he had his vision and the oxen threshed out
prosperity to their masters.</p>

<p>One by one members of the expedition came to inquire, for he was
its life and soul. Others might despair, but never he. Gentlemen in
faded uniforms came, peasants, woodmen, mechanics, some of the
offscourings of the streets of Rochelle and elsewhere, and even
young girls were permitted to inquire. To these Saget and Nika were
kind, for they were chaste and they were giving all for no present
return, and these servants of La Salle knew it&mdash;for these
girls there was no future; they could not marry among the men of
the expedition, for the best were dead.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Cavelier came much to his brother's bedside, and
Friar Membr&eacute; the head of the priests, knelt and prayed for
the recovery of this stricken hero, and at Mass in the small chapel
he was remembered. At last their prayers were heard, and La Salle
came out again into the open world on the arm of Liotot, and
greeted kindly those who were to do him ill Duhaut, Hiens,
Teissier, and the rest.</p>

<p>He determined to make his way by the Mississippi and Illinois to
Canada to bring succor to his colonists. The Abb&eacute;, his
brother, Moranget, his nephew, the Friar Anastase Douay, and twenty
altogether were chosen to go with him. The whole colony was
ransacked for outfit. Men labored to patch their fading garments or
take their place with buffalo or deer skins.</p>

<p>In April, loaded with weapons, kettles, axes, and gifts for
Indians, they issued from the gate, and bravely set forth once
more. They disappeared into the misty waste, the sun behind them
and all the country glowing with the verdure of spring. Again La
Salle cheered his followers.</p>

<p>Left with a gradually dwindling colony, Joutel kept the people
occupied building, hunting, and planting vegetables. Meanwhile
Duhaut the elder, a vain man, had fomented discontent among the
colonists, telling them that La Salle would never return, and he
tried to make himself their leader. The priests did their best to
counteract these disgraceful acts, watched Liotot and Duhaut
continually and reasoned with the settlers, trying to stem the
conspiracy, and at last they spoke to Joutel.</p>

<p>Joutel sternly rebuked the offenders and did his best to
encourage the dejected settlers. To Duhaut he said: &ldquo;You are
no explorer, you have few qualities of worth. You have no gift for
leadership at all. You are as a pinhead beside the Sieur de la
Salle. Have done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The strange thing was that, like Father Anastase Douay, Friar
Membr&eacute; was injured by a furious buffalo bull, and Father
Maxime LeClerc by a boar. Thus the three priests had come to grief
in the wild life, and Friar Membr&eacute; was three months before
he recovered. Women and girls went out with the hunters to aid in
cutting up the meat. The young Canadian, Barbier, became enamored
of one of the girls, and he came to Joutel:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, Babette Laroque is beautiful and young and
sweet, and I would marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel replied, &ldquo;I must consult the clergy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done, and consent was given, and in these strange
surroundings came the happy sacrament of matrimony with what gayety
and cheerful rites as were possible. There were few ribbons, but a
feast of wild meat and fancy pudding and pies and cakes were
repared, but all the wine was gone. There was but one bottle of
brandy for all, and each had a sip. In these somber
surroundings&mdash;somber not where nature was concerned, because
it was bright and buoyant&mdash;the awful isolation preyed upon the
minds of all and they were lost in melancholy.</p>

<p>One day the Marquis de la Sablonni&egrave;re begged leave to
marry another of the girls:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Joutel, I would give myself the honor to marry
Manette Ridot. I am lonely, and she is beautiful and would be a
good wife to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel, the gardener's son, gazed at him with stern reserve. Two
things weighed with him. The Marquis de la Sablonni&egrave;re was
of the aristocracy; this girl was of the peasant class! His mind
revolted from it. Besides, the Marquis was suffering from disease
got at St. Domingo and it would be shameless and criminal to marry
Manette.</p>

<p>He said, sternly, &ldquo;Monsieur le Marquis, if she married you
she would have a quicker dispatch from this world than by the bite
of a venomous snake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marquis was furious. He dropped a hand upon his sword, but
Joutel said, sternly: &ldquo;Stop that! You know what you are. Keep
what you are to yourself. In a few months you will not be able to
join any expedition, Monsieur le Marquis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De la Sablonni&egrave;re was of the outcasts of high society. He
was young, corrupt, kindly, hopeless. He had no real courage. This
gardener's son was far beneath him socially, but as high above him
morally as the sky is from the earth. He plucked at his small
moustache, but his weak eyes could not face the resolute Joutel. He
turned on his heel and walked away.</p>

<p>This was not the kind of man to build up a new colony, but
three-fourths of the people who came were right, and one-fourth
were worthless. The women and girls were of the better peasant and
lower middle class. They were decent, wholesome, and upright. There
was no immorality in the camp. They lived in hope of a ship coming
from France to rescue them, and in dread of Spanish ships landing
troops to destroy them, for Spaniards had been here, as they all
knew from the Indians who came and went.</p>

<p>At last one evening they heard shouts from beyond the river, and
Joutel recognized La Salle's voice. Twenty men had gone with La
Salle and eight returned with him. Four had deserted, one had been
lost, one had been killed by an alligator, and the rest had
perished in regaining the fort. The joy of the settlers was great
because La Salle had that which gave them confidence and faith. His
failures did not put the colony against him&mdash;only the few!</p>

<p>These were Joutel's words to La Salle when asked about the
<i>Belle</i>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! On May day I heard a voice crying out,
&lsquo;<i>Qui vive!</i>&rsquo; I answered,
&lsquo;<i>Versailles!</i>&rsquo; which was the password given to
Barbier should he come back in the night, but I heard other voices
than his. Among the rest was Sieur Chefdeville, who told me that
the <i>Belle</i> was wrecked on the other side of the bay, and that
all were drowned save the six in the canoe&mdash;himself, Teissier
the pilot, a soldier, and three others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is indeed disaster,&rdquo; said La Salle in a
troubled voice. &ldquo;She contained my papers, our baggage, and
what was needed to take us from this spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they brought back your papers and some
baggage,&rdquo; replied Joutel.</p>

<p>La Salle and his followers had journeyed towards the northeast
over green plains and through prairie covered with buffalo. They
reached the bank of a river, where Hiens was mired and nearly
suffocated in a mud-hole and was saved by La Salle. They came upon
Indian towns, and the Cenis Indians, then powerful but now extinct,
overwhelmed them with kindness. The lodges of the Cenis were forty
or fifty feet high, covered with meadow grass, looking like huge
beehives. The spoil of the Spaniards was seen on every side. These
Cenis spoke with contempt of the Spaniards. They moved on, but
after two months they found the stock of ammunition nearly spent
and their condition was such that they could do naught but return
to Fort St. Louis.</p>

<p>The excitement of La Salle's return soon gave place to deep
dejection. They watched with anxious eyes for an approaching sail,
but none came. Less than forty-five remained out of near two
hundred colonists. La Salley by his composure, his hardihood, his
adamantine temper, his audacity of hope, his words of encouragement
and cheer, was the breath of life of this unhappy company.</p>

<p>He prepared once more to go to Canada and to take Joutel with
him, intending to send Joutel to France with his brother to ask
succor for the colony. They were in sad straits for clothing, but
the sails of the <i>Belle</i> were cut up to make coats for the
adventurers, and the colony was racked to find odd bits of clothing
for the neat but ragged members of the expedition.</p>

<p>Here in his little colony, reduced now, La Salle looked back at
all he had tried to do. His heart was strong within him. He and his
friends might pass, but what he had done would stay.</p>

<p>Looking back, La Salle saw Fort Frontenac enlarged, Fort Louis
on the Illinois the center of great development, Fort Louis on the
Mississippi the beginning of greatest development; all under the
will of God. He had become responsible for those thousands of
leagues of luxurious land: his hand, his brain, his soul had made
all possible. On Christmas day there was to be Mass in the crude,
unhandsome chapel, and he and his colony would be there in the best
clothes they had&mdash;and they were meager and patched and worn,
except for his own wonderful scarlet tunic, which he had scarcely
worn. The festivities of the day had, of course, been limited.
There was no wine or brandy left, but there was good coffee and
bread, and fresh meat from the prairies, and at dinner, soup,
entr&eacute;e and roast and vegetables, and pudding made of flour
and rice and raisins. All were in cheerfulness, because, somehow,
the spirit of La Salle, which again was self-possessed and
resolute, affected all. It was folly to say he had only influence
with Indians. It was his nearness to the elemental soul that gave
him power over the Indians, but he had also power to influence
great minds in Europe, to get money when he was bankrupt, to found
faith when he stood almost alone in the entire sphere of French
influence. Wherein he lacked was the capacity of Tonty&mdash;to
give himself freely in the casual ways of life; his spiritual
concentration made him a lonely, isolated figure, and yet he was
the heart and soul of this martyr expedition. How few of all who
had come from France would ever see it again&mdash;how few! Yet
these men and women would live on.</p>

<p>At the Christmas dinner La Salle made a brief speech. On his
left was his brother, on his right was Friar Membr&eacute; and at
the same table were the other priests of the expedition and its few
dissident and some faithful members.</p>

<p>La Salle rose. His soul was in his dark eyes. Somehow, all
applauded, for he seemed lifted up. They were all lost, even the
worst of them, in his atmosphere for the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellow-countrymen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is the day
of Christ, and in the chapel we shall celebrate Mass in honor of
the blessedness of life. We have had trials and misfortunes. The
<i>Joly</i> has returned to France, the <i>Aimable</i> was wrecked,
the <i>St. Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, the <i>Belle</i>, were lost, but
behind these misfortunes is the everlasting truth: that we, a few
faithful souls, have started for France a work which will live
long. Many of our fellow-settlers are gone, but we live on. I go
with a small company to Canada and rescue shall come for those who
stay behind. We cannot all go. The women may not, they could not
endure the journey. We must not yield this settlement; it shall
stay.&rdquo; He raised his hand. &ldquo;Please God, prosperity will
come to those left behind; to the vast populations of Frenchmen who
will live in these wide spaces. Two years have passed since we
landed. They have been filled with toil and faith and loss and
love. I have gone on explorations three times; I now go the fourth
time, and this will be the last, for I shall come to a happy
destiny for us all. Now may the love of God sustain us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made the sign of the cross and everyone present did the same,
and all stood up and with smiles and tears cheered.</p>

<p>In the crude, unhandsome chapel, in primeval surroundings, the
priests officiated, and when Friar Membr&eacute; raised the
consecrated wafer, and the lamps shone dimly through the mists of
incense, the kneeling group knew well that the beautiful vestments
of the priests, compared with their own humble clothing, was the
difference between the permanent success of this expedition and its
momentary relapse. Some spirit of divinity seemed to fill the
space. It was like a strange dream through which shone the glorious
splendor of France and of the Church. The humblest intelligence
present was under a hypnotic spiritual influence. Even Liotot,
Duhaut, and Hiens were impressed.</p>

<p>Through the mists came the ringing of the bell twice&mdash;first
for the elevation of the Host, and then for the chalice, and as
Friar Membr&eacute; raised the sacred vessel there came the words
from all the congregation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Savior of the world, save us, for by Thy Cross and by Thy
Blood Thou hast redeemed us. Help us, we beseech Thee, O our God.
Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the &ldquo;Agnus Dei,&rdquo; these words pierced the
tender mists:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In saying to thine apostles, &lsquo;My peace I leave with
you, iny peace I give unto you,&rsquo; Thou hast promised, O Lord,
to all Thy Church that peace which the world cannot
give&mdash;peace with Thee and peace with ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XLIII</h3>

<h3>Au 'Voir La Salle</h3>

<p><strong>Twelfth</strong> Night came, and on the morrow, La Salle
and his little expedition would start for Canada. They met in the
hall where they dined on Christmas Eve, and held the Twelfth Night
revels. Twelfth Night cake made of good flour and raisins and some
dried orange peel and other pleasant ingredients was brought in
with burning candles, and it was cut by La Salle. All had their
share, and it was small, and when they had eaten it La Salle stood
up. He raised a glass high. In it showed no wine or brandy. There
was none left:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The King drinks!&rdquo; he said, and everyone present
raised a tin cup holding a little cold water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The King drinks!&rdquo; said every voice, and as they
drank hearts grew suddenly hopeful, then presently sad.</p>

<p>The King was drinking at Versailles, with all the wealth and
splendor of modern France round him, and not in spaces like these.
King Louis and his courtiers, with wine in plenty, drank to the
happiness and peace of all the French Empire. He and they were in
luxury and plenty. La Salle and his people were in misery and
lonely fear, but as La Salle lowered his cup he looked round and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We go a long travel, a hard path. We shall have much to
endure. Will the friar bless us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With bowed heads before him, Friar Membr&eacute; lifted up his
arm and solemnly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The peace of God which passeth all understanding be with
you and remain with you forever. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning at daylight La Salle's company, with five
horses bought from the Indians, stood in the yard of the fort,
ready for the march. Barbier was to remain behind in control, with
Sablonni&egrave;re, the Friar Membr&eacute; and the Sieur
Chefdeville, with a surgeon, soldiers, laborers, women and girls
and several children, who faced the dark uncertainty of the future.
With the sun shining bright, and equipped and weaponed for their
journey, the little band turned and looked upon those who they were
leaving behind. They were laden with meager baggage and presents
for Indians.</p>

<p>With La Salle were his brother, the Abb&eacute;, his two
nephews, Moranget and the boy Cavelier, Joutel, and Friar Anastase
Douay. Besides these were Duhaut, and Liotot, both now evil-hearted
men who were ready to do dark things, though in France they had
held good positions. Hardship and misfortune had poisoned them.
There were also the German Hiens, the Sieur de Marle, Teissier, a
pilot, Barthelemy and Talon, L'Archeveque, a servant of Duhaut, and
Nika and Saget, La Salle's servant and guide. In all were
seventeen.</p>

<p>La Salle shook hands warmly with all who were to stay and he
stooped and kissed a little girl, his eyes amiable, yet mystical.
Then standing at salute, he raised a hand to his cap, as though to
say farewell and God be with you, but he did not speak. In his face
was the pathos of his one awful mistake, hidden from them, and the
resolution of his grave, enduring character. Slowly he and his
friends filed silently from the gate, crossed the river, and
marched slowly through the staring sun and over the limitless
prairies where wild life teemed, till Fort St. Louis was hidden
from their sight.</p>

<p>When they were far out La Salle, at the head of his company,
turned to Joutel and said, &ldquo;This journey solves my
fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the fate of us all, Sieur de la Salle,&rdquo; was
Joutel's reply.</p>

<p>La Salle nodded. &ldquo;Yes, the fate of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel was young and full of vigor, not a gentleman, but with
the spirit of the best that belongs to France&mdash;a man, an
ardent follower of La Salle, the reliable friend. Of him La Salle
had never had the shadow of a doubt. He had not the same thought
concerning others, and yet he felt himself on the highway to better
days.</p>

<p>As they trudged on, Duhaut and Liotot, who walked together,
talked in low words, glaring darkly at La Salle. The priests walked
together, and the Abb&eacute; Cavelier, lean, ascetic wiry, and
physically strong, conversed in a low voice with Father Douay, and
in his keen furtive eyes was the look of the pioneer. It had got
there at last. He had never talked much to his brother, and he
talked less as time went on. His coming at all had been one of the
mysteries of his nature and life. He had never been a traveling
missionary like P&egrave;re Marquette and many others. The soul of
the life was not in him. But he adored success, and by instinct he
was a courtier and a miser, and riches were his ever-present
thought. If La Salle had not succeeded at Versailles he would have
abandoned him; because he has succeeded he would be his critical
follower; but since the expedition had started he had shown a
fluttering interest and at last something of the pioneer spirit had
entered him. He had little heart. Friar Membr&eacute; was nearer to
La Salle than his own brother&mdash;his was an unwholesome
nature.</p>

<p>Father Douay said to him: &ldquo;I feel, somehow, we are on the
way to better days. But we shall have hard
going&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="image">[image: Marquis de Seignelay]</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; shook his head somberly. &ldquo;I know not, but
I hope.&rdquo; Then he shook his head again. &ldquo;I like not that
Duhaut and Liotot. They will give trouble. We are not
united&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moranget, his nephew, was in talk with Duhaut and Liotot now,
and he said, &ldquo;I'll eat my pantaloons if we don't come out of
this all right.&rdquo; He laughed vapidly, for he was of thin
intellect and had a quarrelsome and violent temper.</p>

<p>Both these men hated him, for he had more than ever shown stupid
braggadocio, and they looked furtively at him. &ldquo;Well, you'll
have a filthy meal,&rdquo; said Duhaut.</p>

<p>Moranget with an oath flung away from him.</p>

<p>Nika and Saget walked together. They did not speak at all, but
in Nika's eyes were forebodings of tragedy and he could not have
told why, but they were present. Faithful and devoted to La Salle,
he had been with him many years. How often had he provided food for
them all when they were near starvation!</p>

<p>Hiens, behind them, alone, as though to himself said,
&ldquo;It's a long way to the Mississippi, that's so!&rdquo; He
laughed satirically.</p>

<p>Nika heard but his eyes only glowed the deeper.</p>

<p>Prairie and forest, wood and river, rain and shine, buffalo and
wild game in plenty, and so they trudged on day after day. They
were sadly in want of shoes, so they made coverings of buffalo
hide, which they must keep always wet, because when dry it hardened
about the foot like iron, and they bought deer skins from the
friendly Indians to make good moccasins. Herds of buffalo, whose
tread through the forest made good paths for the weary travelers,
passed them. When bad weather came they built huts of bark and
meadow grass; they set a rude stockade about their camp. They met
Indians constantly, visited them in their camps, sat within their
lodges on buffalo robes, and watched them killing herds of buffalo
with lances of sharpened bone.</p>

<p>Keeping a northerly course, they reached the waters of the
Trinity and they endured unfavorable weather for days at a time. It
was not a happy company. La Salle, who could not pretend, became
cold and reserved to those in whom he had no faith, like Liotot and
Duhaut. They had money in the enterprise, and were bitter. Liotot
was at heart a foe of La Salle. He charged him with the death of a
relative who, on a previous journey, had failed in strength and was
ordered by La Salle to return to the fort, and was killed by
Indians on the way. Besides, young Moranget, with foolishly
impulsive temper, was hated by Liotot, who had treated him for a
wound by an Indian arrow and nursed him with care and had been
rewarded with abuse.</p>

<p>They came at last in the middle of March to a spot not far from
where La Salle had, on a preceding journey, left a quantity of
Indian corn and beans in <i>cache</i>. He sent Liotot and Duhaut
and l'Archeveque and Nika to bring in the corn. When the
<i>cache</i> was opened the contents were spoiled, but as they were
returning Nika shot two buffalo, and a servant was sent to inform
La Salle that he might send horses to bring in the meat.</p>

<p>La Salle directed Moranget and De Marie to go with his servant,
Saget, to the hunter's camp. There Moranget found that Duhaut and
the others, having cut up the meat, had reserved for themselves the
marrow bones, to which by custom they had right, but Moranget
violently scolded them, and ended by seizing the whole of the meat.
Thereupon Liotot, Duhaut, and Hiens resolved to kill Moranget that
night. Also, Nika and Saget must die with him, for they were
faithful to La Salle.</p>

<p>It was a night ill suited to crime, with the young moon, bright
stars, the fresh smell of the green wood and the verdure round.
They ate their evening meal and pipes were smoked, apparently at
peace, but there was no peace. Rancor, hatred, dark purpose were in
the minds of those who arranged that the first three guards of the
night should be Moranget, Saget, and Nika.</p>

<p>Each in his turn stood watching, and saw the moon slowly rise,
and the stars glimmer in the far blue sky; then at last each rolled
in his blanket and was soon deep in slumber. The night was
beautiful and clear. The moon shone.</p>

<p>Slowly Liotot with an ax stole towards the three sleepers and
struck a rapid blow at each. Duhaut and Hiens stood with guns
cocked, but there was no need to fire. All three were killed
instantly, and the murderers looked scornfully at these men, of
whom Nika was an infinite loss to this little
company&mdash;faithful, skillful, wise in his primitive way, and he
had been with La Salle so many years and was trusted and
resourceful.</p>

<p>Liotot turned to Duhaut. &ldquo;Now for the dastardly La
Salle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duhaut grimly inclined his head, but Hiens hesitated, for La
Salle had saved his life and there was in him some touch of
definite loyalty. They did not bury the men. They left them in
their blankets with stark eyes staring at their eternal night.</p>

<p>Only six miles away, with all the details of a camp about him,
with idle Indians lounging or strolling, with men sleeping or
smoking, with black kettles hung from tripods over the fires, and
the horses grazing near by, La Salle sat silent, but disturbed. His
nephew, Moranget, and Saget and De Marie had been expected the
night before, but they had not come. La Salle resolved to go and
find them. To Joutel he said, &ldquo;Have you heard of any evil
purposes against Moranget and the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. They have complained and blasphemed, that is
all. They would not tell me of evil purpose; they know me
loyal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La Salle shook his head and a grim look came to his eyes and
mouth. He smoked hard, he thought much, but he was silent. The next
morning he started with an Indian guide. He now directed Joutel to
remain in charge of the camp and to keep faithful watch. He
summoned Friar Douay to go with him and they borrowed Joutel's gun
and pistol.</p>

<p>During the six miles walk La Salle spoke of naught at first but
religion, of grace and predestination, acknowledging the debt he
owed to God in all his twenty years of exploration. Then suddenly
he became overwhelmed with profound sadness, for which he did not
seek to account. He sat down on the bough of a fallen tree and
buried his face in his hands. At last he rose, grown serene and
calm, and there came from his lips the sixteenth-century prayer. He
lifted his face to the quiet sky and said:</p>

<p class="prayer">O Lord support us all the day long of this
troublous life until the shades lengthen and the evening comes and
the busy world is hushed and the fever of life is over and our work
done. Then in Thy mercy grant us safe lodging and holy rest and
peace at the last.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the Friar made the sign of the cross and
his lips murmured the benediction. After a moment they moved
on.</p>

<p>They came near to the camp of Duhaut on the farther side of the
small river. La Salle fired his gun as a summons to any of his
followers. Guessing he had fired the shots, Duhaut and his evil
friends crossed the river, though trees hid them from sight. Liotot
and Duhaut crouched like Indians in the long dry grass, while
l'Archeveque stood in sight near the bank.</p>

<p>La Salle advancing, saw l'Archeveque, and asked where was
Moranget.</p>

<p>The servant did not lift his hat, but replied in a tone of
studied insolence that Moranget was no doubt strolling
somewhere.</p>

<p>La Salle rebuked him. L'Archeveque's insolence increased,
drawing back as he spoke, towards the ambuscade, while La Salle
advanced upon him. The day was beautiful, the trees whispered in a
slight breeze, birds sang, and the sun was like a soft cauldron of
light. It was not a scene for trouble, but for peace. Yet a
copperhead snake crossed the path, the deadly venom of the wilds.
In the air some distant spirit sang&mdash;a low, clear, loving
sound. All seemed well, and yet the devil's son, l'Archeveque,
backed towards the trees.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there came from the grass a shot, followed by
another, and, stricken through the brain, the intrepid La Salle
dropped to the ground dead.</p>

<p>Thus, at the age of fourty-three, one of the greatest men of all
the ages, R&eacute;n&eacute; Robert Robert Cavelier de la Salle,
whose name abides forever, disappeared from the scene of his work,
but enshrined himself immortality which comes to such as he.</p>

<p>The Friar was terror-stricken, but Duhaut called out that he had
naught to fear. They came forward and with wild looks gazed at La
Salle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There thou liest, great Bashaw! There thou liest!&rdquo;
exclaimed Liotot, in gross exultation over the quiet body.</p>

<p>With mockery and insult they stripped it and dragged it into the
bushes.</p>

<p>Friar Anastase Douay returned to La Salle's camp in horror, and
rushed into the hut of the Abb&eacute; Cavelier. At the sight of
him the priest, reading the catastrophe in his face, cried out,
&ldquo;My poor brother is dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then entered on them. Liotot, Duhaut, and the rest.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute;, his young nephew, and Douay fell on their
knees, expecting instant death, the Abb&eacute; begging piteously
for half an hour to prepare. But Duhaut shook his head. &ldquo;No
more blood shall be shed. We have done our duty. The tyrant is gone
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party was now reduced to Joutel, Douay, Cavelier, Teissier,
De Marle, and Hiens, and his young nephew, two other boys, the
orphan Talon, and a lad called Barthelemy, and Liotot, Duhaut, and
l'Archeveque.</p>

<p>Joutel was absent, and l'Archeveque, who liked him, went to find
him. When Joutel saw him coming he was astounded and anxious.
L'Archeveque seemed all confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have bad news. What is it?&rdquo; Joutel's voice was
broken.</p>

<p>L'Archeveque, faltering, answered that La Salle was dead, also
that Moranget, Nika, and Saget had been killed.</p>

<p>Joutel was overcome. &ldquo;Good God! Do they mean to kill me
too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They said no more blood was to be shed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel did not know what to do. He had no gun, only one pistol,
no balls or powder.</p>

<p>L'Archeveque read the look in his face: &ldquo;Do not fear,
m'sieu' Joutel; they will not kill you&mdash;no. I beg you return
to camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment's study Joutel raised his head and returned to
camp. In the tent he saw the Abb&eacute; Cavelier and Father Douay
praying in a corner, but he did not go towards them until he knew
the will of the assassins.</p>

<p>They were in terrible excitement and uneasy and embarrassed.</p>

<p>Duhaut at length said: &ldquo;No more killing! Each will take
command in turn, and all shall be well now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At dinner that night, when the murderers shared out the meat
without regard to proportion, as had been the past custom, the
Abb&eacute;, Father Douay, Joutel, and others were told to mount
guard as usual; that what was done came through despair, and they
meant no more harm to anybody.</p>

<p>To this the Abb&eacute; Cavelier said that when they slew the
Monsieur de la Salle they had slain themselves for there was no one
else who could get them out of this country. To this Duhaut and
Liotot made angry replies, Liotot saying: &ldquo;He was not the
only bushman or voyageur. We too have traveled, and we will find
our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they quieted, and arms were handed to their former
comrades. The Abb&eacute; Cavelier, Joutel, and the others spent a
sleepless night, but they pledged themselves to stand together to
the last and to escape as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Joutel said they should kill the murderers in their sleep, but
the Abb&eacute; Cavelier said vengeance should be left to God, and
that he himself had more to revenge than the others, having lost
his brother and his nephew. So Duhaut and Liotot were for the
moment safe. In the morning Duhaut and Liotot determined to go to
the Cenis village and to take Joutel with them. At the Cenis Indian
villages they were received with honor and sumptuously fed with
sagamite, corn cake, beans, bread made of the meal of parched corn,
and other bread made of the kernels of nuts and the seeds of
sunflowers. Then the pipe of peace was lighted and all smoked
together. The Frenchmen proposed traffic in provisions, and they
exchanged knives, beads, and other trinkets for corn and beans.</p>

<p>In Indian villages they were well received, and some of these
dwellings were of great size. The travelers were lodged in one of
the largest. One night as Joutel lay between sleeping and waking on
buffalo robes that covered his bed of canes, and all round the
lodge the inmates were buried in sleep, with the fire still
burning, the sound of a footstep wakened him. He saw at his side
the figure of an Indian armed with bows and arrows.</p>

<p>Joutel said, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; in a hoarse whisper,
reaching for his pistol.</p>

<p>As, not answering, the intruder turned and sat by the fire,
Joutel followed and saw that the face and body, though tattooed,
were not that of an Indian. Indeed, the figure presently rose and
threw his arms around Joutel's neck, saying he was a Breton sailor
named Ruter; that he and his sailor friend, Grollet, had feared to
come to the village lest they should meet La Salle, whom they had
once deserted.</p>

<p>Joutel said, &ldquo;Have no fear, the Sieur de la Salle has gone
to Heaven. He was sent there by Duhaut, Liotot and Hiens, having
also killed Moranget, La Salle's nephew, and Nika and Saget, his
servant and his guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joutel bowed his head in sorrow, but Ruter replied: &ldquo;I
deserted from the Sieur de la Salle, but he was great. What devils
they were to kill that man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved his body backwards and forwards in agitation. He left
in the morning, carrying with him a present of beads for his wives,
of whom he had several, and in a few days he returned, bringing
Grollet with him, each wearing a bunch of turkey feathers dangling
from his head and wrapped in native blankets.</p>

<p>Duhaut and Liotot had separate camps, and Douay and the two
Caveliers had been treated with harshness and disdain and were
obliged to eat their meals apart. The assassins quarreled among
themselves, and Hiens, fierce against Duhaut and Liotot, who had
seized all the plunder, went about morosely.</p>

<p>Joutel and his comrades talked of naught but how to make their
way to Canada; and so they devised a simple plan of escape.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Cavelier was to be too tired for the journey and
wished to stay among the Cenis Indians. To this the old priest
consented, for truth was not an indispensable thing to him, and
they gained the assent of Liotot and Duhaut, but Ruter, the French
savage, told Duhaut of Joutel's plan and Duhaut said that he and
his men would also go to Canada.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had enough of lies and tricks,&rdquo; he said,
fiercely, &ldquo;and we will go to Quebec city, where we shall be
well received.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this with a disdainful smile, for he knew that many
merchants would welcome the disappearance of the Sieur de la Salle.
Hiens and the others, hearing of Duhaut's plan of going to Canada,
said they would not consent.</p>

<p>One morning Hiens appeared at the came of Duhaut and Liotot with
Ruter and Grollet and about twenty Indians. Duhaut and Liotot were
practicing with bows and arrows in front of their hut. They were
excitedly rivaling each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Liotot to Hiens, but Hiens
said, sullenly, &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiens then said to Duhaut, &ldquo;I want my share of the
goods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duhaut's reply was: &ldquo;The goods are ours. La Salle owed
them for what we invested and lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at Hiens fiercely.</p>

<p>Hiens then said: &ldquo;So you will not give them to
me&mdash;no? You are a wretch; you killed my master,&rdquo; and,
flashing a pistol from his belt, he fired at Duhaut, who staggered
and fell dead.</p>

<p>At the same instant Ruter fired at Liotot, shot three balls into
his body, and mortally wounded him.</p>

<p>Joutel, Douay, and the two Caveliers stood in terror, thinking
that their turn would come next, and they held their guns ready to
defend themselves, but Hiens said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fear. I killed them to avenge the death of La
Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liotot, still alive, tried to raise himself and said to Hiens:
&ldquo;I killed La Salle; this man has killed me. I pay my price.
God forgive me for my sin. O God forgive&mdash;forgive!&rdquo; He
sank slowly back, and was killed by Ruter exploding a pistol with a
blank charge of powder against his head.</p>

<p>While this was done the Indians looked on amazed, for here were
Frenchmen killing one another in a most atrocious way. Joutel
anxiously said to them: &ldquo;These men murdered our great leader,
La Salle, and he has been avenged; that is all. They earned death,
and it is theirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiens and others of the French promised to join the Cenis
against a neighboring tribe, and six Frenchmen went with Hiens and
the rest, including Joutel, Douay, and the Caveliers. They remained
a week or more among the Cenis, but at length came news of a great
victory, and with the return of the Indians it was said that the
French guns had won the battle, and several days were spent in
ceremonies and feasts of triumph.</p>

<p>Joutel and his comrades explained to Hiens their plan to reach
home by way of the Mississippi, but he angrily said he would not
run the risk of losing his life; but after argument he agreed to
their going, but the Abb&eacute; Cavelier must give him a
certificate of innocence of the murder of La Salle, and this the
priest did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Hiens as he read the certificate.
&ldquo;You are free to go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He supplied them with hatchets, knives, beads, and other
articles of trade, and several horses, showing that, with all his
evil, there was some good in him, yet he walked about the camp in a
scarlet coat laced with gold, which had belonged to La Salle!</p>

<p>Joutel's party consisted of the Caveliers, Father Douay, De
Marle, Teissier, and the young Parisian named Barthelemy. Teissier
had received from Cavelier a form of pardon in the crime against
Moranget and La Salle.</p>

<p>Hiens embraced them at parting and said, &ldquo;Go in peace, and
may the end be good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they left the Cenis villages and Hiens, on the morning when
the sun was bright and all the trees and all the grass was green.
After a safe journey of about two months, in which De Marle was
drowned while bathing, they approached the river Arkansas, not far
from its junction with the Mississippi. Beneath the forests of the
farther shore they saw the lodges of a large Indian town and their
weary bodies and sad hearts became elated. They saw a tall wooden
cross, and near it a small house evidently built by Christian
hands. Falling on their knees they raised their arms to Heaven in
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Two men in European dress fired welcoming guns for the excited
travelers. Canoes came and they were ferried to the town, where
they were welcomed by Couture and De Launay, two assistants of
Henri de Tonty!</p>

<p>The Indian town was moved to tears by the stories of their
disasters. La Salle's death was carefully hidden from the Indians,
who had held him in respect. They feasted and danced before Joutel,
Cavelier, and the others, from sunset until dawn.</p>

<p>With guides they continued their journey in a canoe on the 1st
of August, went down the Arkansas, and reached the bleak, powerful
Mississippi in its shady provinces of loneliness and shadow. They
passed the mouth of the Ohio, saw Marquette's picture rock and the
line of craggy heights called on old French maps &ldquo;The Ruined
Castles.&rdquo; In September they saw the cliff of Fort St. Louis,
and as they came near, a troop of friendly Indians, headed by a
Frenchman, fired guns. They replied, and Boisrondet, Tonty's
comrade in the Iroquois war, greeted them and asked where was La
Salle.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Cavelier, with a glance of understanding at
Joutel, concealed his brother's death, and replied that La Salle
had been with them as far as the Cenis villages and that they had
left him in good health.</p>

<p>They waited at the fort for Tonty, who was absent, fighting the
Iroquois, but his garrison of bushrangers greeted them with salutes
of musketry and the whoops of Indians. In the spacious chapel the
&ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; was sung, and thanks were given to God who
had preserved and guided them. At length October arrived, and
meanwhile Tonty returned from the Iroquois war, where he had fought
Senecas with Du Lhut.</p>

<p>Tonty listened with profound interest to the mournful story of
his guests. The Abb&eacute; Cavelier knew his generous character
and his faithful service to La Salle.</p>

<p>Tonty said to him: &ldquo;I had every faith in him, and I have
still. Nothing overcomes him, nothing can. Life, wealth, is naught
to him save for his native land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Tonty's eyes, always generous, was a glimmer of tears; in the
face of La Salle's brother was deception. Four thousand livres in
furs, besides other goods and a canoe, were delivered to him by the
unsuspecting Tonty. At the doors of the settlement they bade
good-by to the man who had cared for them for months and whom the
Abb&eacute; Cavelier had so brutally misled.</p>

<p>Tonty watched them go, with a sudden inexplainable sense of
mistrust. He did not suspect the real truth, for he believed in
Joutel, but the face of the Abb&eacute; Cavelier had always been to
him a symbol of deceit.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Chapter XLIV</h3>

<h3>&ldquo;Oh, Tender Heart!&rdquo;</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>No</strong>, La Salle is dead,&rdquo; said
Louvigny.</p>

<p>Lya's face turned almost white and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Abb&eacute; Cavelier who passed through Quebec,
said he left him in good health among Cenis Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louvigny shook his head. &ldquo;Yes, I know. He had got money
and skins from Monsieur Tonty. He sold the skins at a profit before
he came to Quebec, then he went to France. There for long he hid
the death of La Salle because he hoped that Seignelay would pay
what his brother owed him. At last he told the truth and petitioned
the King for all La Salle's property in Canada. This I came to know
to-day. I have a letter from the Abb&eacute; Renadout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louvigny paused. The face of the girl was shocked and bitter.
&ldquo;The Abb&eacute; has a heart of stone,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and from first to last he has been false to his great
brother. A liar, and a thief!&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some good was in him or he would not have gone with La
Salle. He loaned his brother money. If he could love anyone, he
loved La Salle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God save the world from love like that,&rdquo; was the
response. &ldquo;He went because La Salle owed him money. He was
only the friend of success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment a servant entered. &ldquo;Monsieur Tonty has
come,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Lya's hand went swiftly to her breast. It seemed all was coming
at once. Her eyes dimmed, she trembled.</p>

<p>Louvigny smiled, because he and his wife had long known the deep
friendly spirit Lya had for Henri de Tonty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see monsieur first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then
send him in to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the time of year when all the trees were taking on the
colors of the rainbow, when a wild blaze of tender color lay upon
all the land in the bright sun. Flights of gulls were overhead,
droves of pigeons sailed by, wild geese and turkeys honked past,
and all over was the splendor of autumn, the sweetest season in
this new land. She saw the <i>habitants</i> coming to market with
vegetables, jars of maple syrup and slabs of maple sugar, and all
kinds of cordials. How good, how bad it was, for behind it all was
the threat of the Iroquois, who, reduced in numbers, were daily
becoming more menacing. Peace was here, but not a permanent peace,
for weakness was in high places.</p>

<p>She saw the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis, high above the waters, the
Bishop's palace, the seminary, the hospital, the Basilica and the
residence of the Intendant where had been her unhappy interview
with Duchesneau. All was not well in Quebec, for Denonville, the
Governor, had completely failed to destroy the Iroquois.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes. White clouds were moving fast, but in the
air of this new land was the thrill of life, of hope, of faith, of
noble destiny. La Salle was gone forever. She recalled his leaving
Rochelle with the four ships and her words as she saw them
pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows, God knows!&rdquo; she had said.</p>

<p>She had only met Tonty once, yet there had grown up between them
a sense of deep comradeship and what was far deeper still. It was
the soul of this land.</p>

<p>Now Henri de Tonty was here. She turned from the window, the
door opened, and Tonty made a swift, sad gesture and with glowing
eyes came forward. She gave him her hand; he kissed it, then, after
a few moments of broken words, he said: &ldquo;I have come from
where La Salle was murdered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And gained his immortality,&rdquo; she said, nodding.
&ldquo;I have just learned that the Abb&eacute; had hidden his
brother's death to get goods and money from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonty waved a hand, then said, satirically: &ldquo;The
Abb&eacute; Cavelier will die rich, but none will mourn his
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not sit down?&rdquo; Lya said.</p>

<p>They seated themselves in the big comfortable room where the
rugs were the skins of wild animals and on the walls were trophies
of the chase, and ever the bright happy sun shone through the
window.</p>

<p>Tonty spoke again: &ldquo;Over a year ago I learned from Couture
and De Launay, whom I had left at Fort Illinois, that La Salle had
been slain. With five Frenchmen and a Shawanoe Indian I set out for
the abandoned colony. After hard trials we reached the Red River,
where the Caddoes Indians were, and learned that Hiens was about
eighty leagues distant. Here the men would go no farther, and I
could not force them. The Shawanoe and one Frenchman stayed with
me. When I came to the village where Hiens had remained, I did not
find him. I charged the Indians with killing him, and when the
women raised their voices in wailing, I knew that what I said was
true. And one of the squaws, an old woman, came in the night and
told me all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we retraced our steps to the Red River and found the
whole country flooded. It rained night and day. We fought through
canebrakes with hatchets, and sometimes were to the neck in water.
We had no meat; we were forced to eat our dogs. Never have I
suffered so much, and never with greater grief. I was detained in
the Arkansas villages by but at last I reached my fort on the
Illinois!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears were in the girl's eyes. She rose to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the soul of a martyr&mdash;yes that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am naught, but La Salle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Salle will live forever,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Their eyes met and all each felt rose and conquered them. Tonty
reached out an arm with love and passion in his handsome eyes. She
understood. With a little cry she put her hands on his shoulders
and he drew her close.</p>

<p>An instant after, with tears in her eyes, she reached down and
raised his metal hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hard hand! Oh, tender heart!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<h3 class="ChapHeader">Epilogue</h3>

<p><strong>Never</strong> had the city of Quebec been in such
gorgeous spirit, never so gay with flags and bunting or brighter
with sun or more vital with crisp, inspiring air. From every public
building flags flew and every house had a touch of color on the
Heights and in Lower Town.</p>

<p>A ship had just anchored in the harbor and eager crowds could
see three boats row towards the shore. When the first boat touched
land all shouted with joy, and the aged ecclesiastic, Laval,
greatly changed, noble, serenely glad, with the Lieutenant-General
De Lothbini&egrave;re and many others, proudly hailed it. They had
come to welcome again to New France Louis, Count Frontenac. The
greeting was like the laugh of a man saved from drowning.
Presently, the excited crowd behind him, Laval made a short,
sincere, congratulatory speech, to which Frontenac, much moved,
replied.</p>

<p>Cannon roared from the cliffs, people shouted from the shore.
The green meadows, the cloudless blue sky, declared eloquently that
once again New France looked up with a sense of security. Even in
the fields the cattle seemed to stand at gaze, birds fluttered
overhead.</p>

<p>All day it was so, and at night were full illuminations, making
the ancient place a scene of gayety, and a few Iroquois looked on
with indignant gaze, they knew their master was come again. All
night the splendid carnival went on, and Quebec flamed forth in
certain hope.</p>

<p>Not far behind the main body of sightseers were Luc Maste, Jules
Ladaux and Luce Hontard.</p>

<p>Luc Maste said to Luce Hontard:
&ldquo;<i>Tonnerre!</i>&mdash;Canada shall now be safe. The
Iroquois shall be beaten&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fat, silent, beautiful in her simplicity, Luce Hontard said,
&ldquo;So&mdash;so&mdash;so!&rdquo; and a smile showed at her slow
lips.</p>

<p>Then Jules Ladaux said, &ldquo;Bidemme, but it is
good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Luc Maste's face darkened. &ldquo;Nearly all Sieur de
la Salle's colony have gone to Heaven. How know I? A French
prisoner led Spaniards to the fort where all had been and none were
left, but near were skeletons, and fragments of a dress showed one
was a woman. So&mdash;so! In the fort itself were rags of the
life&mdash;kettles, well-bound books in the mud. Near by stood
Indians in buffalo robes to the chin, speechless. Indians had come
to trade at the settlers' camp. They would not let them into the
fort, but trade began outside. Then up from ambuscade sprang hosts
of Indians and killed them all, priests and people, and so the
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luce Hontard's brow knitted. &ldquo;Who brought this news to
Canada&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is it, name of God! The Frenchman escaped from
the Spaniards and came here. From him&mdash;the truth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luce Hontard's eyes were dim; yet she was happy.</p>

<p>Behind the three, a voice said: &ldquo;<i>Sacr&eacute; bleu</i>,
that Frontenac he too old&mdash;yes, much too old!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fingers of Luc Maste dropped to the sword at his hip. His
face went black. He turned savagely and said: &ldquo;<i>Tiens</i>,
not too old to save clean and sweet New France and your dirty skin,
pig!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With fright in his face the little riverman turned and ran.</p>

<p>Slowly up the steep hill towards the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis,
Count Frontenac, erect, powerful, the exile returned in triumph,
with Laval beside him, made his way to the ringing of bells and
wild shouts of welcome.</p>

<p>Luce Hontard gazed with shining eyes. &ldquo;Ah, God is
good&mdash;but yes!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>La Salle lives on.</p>
