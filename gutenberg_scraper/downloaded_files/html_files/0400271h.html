<h1><a name="p01">CROSS CREEK</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Cross Creek is a bend in a country road, by land, and the
flowing of Lochloosa Lake into Orange Lake, by water. We are four
miles west of the small village of Island Grove, nine miles east
of a turpentine still, and on the other sides we do not count
distance at all, for the two lakes and the broad marshes create
an infinite space between us and the horizon. We are five white
families; "Old Boss" Brice, the Glissons, the Mackays and the
Bernie Basses; and two colored families, Henry Woodward and the
Mickenses. People in Island Grove consider us just a little
biggety and more than a little queer. Black Kate and I between us
once misplaced some household object, quite unreasonably.</p>

<p>I said, "Kate, am I crazy, or are you?"</p>

<p>She gave me her quick sideways glance that was never entirely
impudent.</p>

<p>"Likely all two of us. Don't you reckon it take somebody a
little bit crazy to live out here at the Creek?"</p>

<p>At one time or another most of us at the Creek have been
suspected of a degree of madness. Madness is only a variety of
mental nonconformity and we are all individualists here. I am
reminded of Miss Malin and the Cardinal in the Gothic tale, "The
Deluge at Norderney."</p>

<p>"But are you not," said the Cardinal, "a little--"</p>

<p>"Mad?" asked the old lady. "I thought that you were aware of
that, My Lord."</p>

<p>The Creek folk of color are less suspect than the rest of us.
Yet there is something a little different about them from blacks
who live gregariously in Quarters, so that even if they did not
live at the Creek, they would stay, I think, somehow aloof from
the layer-cake life of the average Negro. Tom Glisson and Old
Boss and I think anybody is crazy not to live here, but I know
what Kate meant. We have chosen a deliberate isolation, and are
enamored of it, so that to the sociable we give the feeling that
St. Simeon Stylites on top of his desert pillar must have given
the folk who begged him to come down and live among them. He
liked the pillar or he would not have been there. Something about
it suited his nature. And something about Cross Creek suits
us--or something about us makes us cling to it contentedly,
lovingly and often in exasperation, through the vicissitudes that
have driven others away.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't live any place else," Tom said, "if I had gold
buried in Georgia. I tell you, so much happens at Cross
Creek."</p>

<p>There is of course an affinity between people and places. "And
God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
waters called He Seas; and God saw that it was good." This was
before man, and if there be such a thing as racial memory, the
consciousness of land and water must lie deeper in the core of us
than any knowledge of our fellow beings. We were bred of earth
before we were born of our mothers. Once born, we can live
without mother or father, or any other kin, or any friend, or any
human love. We cannot live without the earth or apart from it,
and something is shrivelled in a man's heart when he turns away
from it and concerns himself only with the affairs of men.</p>

<p>And along with our deep knowledge of the earth is a preference
of each of us for certain different kinds of it, for the earth is
various as we are various. One man longs for the mountains, and
does not even need to have been a child of the mountains to have
this longing; and another man yearns for the valleys or the
plains. A seaman I know said that he was making a great effort to
assure himself of going to Hell, for the Bible says that in
Heaven "there shall be no more sea," and Heaven for him is a
place of great waters.</p>

<p>We at the Creek need and have found only very simple things.
We must need flowering and fruiting trees, for all of us have
citrus groves of one size or another. We must need a certain
blandness of season, with a longer and more beneficent heat than
many require, for there is never too much sun for us, and through
the long summers we do not complain. We need the song of birds,
and there is none finer than the red-bird. We need the sound of
rain coming across the <i>hamaca,</i> and the sound of wind in
trees--and there is no more sensitive Aeolian harp than the palm.
The pine is good, for the needles brushing one another have a
great softness, and we have the wind in the pines, too.</p>

<p>We need above all, I think, a certain remoteness from urban
confusion, and while this can be found in other places, Cross
Creek offers it with such beauty and grace that once entangled
with it, no other place seems possible to us, just as when truly
in love none other offers the comfort of the beloved. We are not
even offended when others do not share our delight. Tom Glisson
and I often laugh together at the people who consider the Creek
dull, or, in the precise sense, outlandish.</p>

<p>"There was a fellow woke me up," he said, "was lost. I'd heard
his car go by and hit the Creek bridge like cattle stompeding. I
wondered if ary one in that big of a hurry knowed where he was
going. Directly he come back and stopped and I heard him holler
from the gate. I pulled on my breeches and went out to him. I
said, 'Reckon you're lost.' 'Lost ain't the word for it,' he
said. 'Is this the end of the world? Where in God's name am I?' I
said, 'Mister, you're at Cross Creek.' 'That don't tell me a
thing,' he said. 'I still ain't anywhere.'"</p>

<p>"People in town sometimes say to me when I start home at
night," I said, "'We hate to see you drive off alone to that
awful place.'"</p>

<p>"Well," he said comfortably, "they just don't know the
Creek."</p>

<p>We do. We know one another. Our knowledge is a strange kind,
totally without intimacy, for we go our separate ways and meet
only when new fences are strung, or some one's stock intrudes on
another, or when one of us is ill or in trouble, or when woods
fires come too close, or when a shooting occurs and we must agree
who is right and who must go to jail, or when the weather is so
preposterous, either as to heat or cold, or rain or drought, that
we seek out excuses to be together, to talk together about the
common menace. We get into violent arguments and violent
quarrels, sometimes about stock, sometimes because we take sides
with our favorites when the dark Mickens family goes on the
warpath. The village exaggerates our differences and claims that
something in the Creek water makes people quarrelsome. Our
amenities pass unnoticed. We do injustices among ourselves, and
another of us, not directly involved, usually manages to put in a
judicious word on the side of right. The one who is wrong usually
ends by admitting it, and all is well again, and I have done my
share of the eating of humble pie. And when the great enemies of
Old Starvation and Old Death come skulking down on us, we put up
a united front and fight them side by side, as we fight the woods
fires. Each of us knows the foibles of the others and the
strength and the weaknesses, and who can be counted on for what.
Old Aunt Martha Mickens, with her deceptive humility and her face
like poured chocolate, is perhaps the shuttle that has woven our
knowledge, carrying back and forth, with the apparent innocence
of a nest-building bird, the most revealing bits of gossip; the
sort of gossip that tells, not trivial facts, but human motives
and the secrets of human hearts. Each of us pretends that she
carries these threads only about others and never about us, but
we all know better, and that none of us is spared.</p>

<p>A dozen other whites and a baker's dozen of other blacks have
lived at one time or another among us, or in the immediate
vicinity of the Creek, coming and going like the robins. We are
clannish and do not feel the same about them as we feel about
ourselves. It was believed in the beginning that I was one of
these. Surely the Creek would drive me away. When it was clear
that a freezing of the orange crop was as great a catastrophe to
me as to the others, surely I would not be here long. It was when
old Martha, who had set up the Brices as Old Boss and Old Miss,
referred to me one day as Young Miss, that it was understood by
all of us that I was here to stay.</p>

<p>For myself, the Creek satisfies a thing that had gone hungry
and unfed since childhood days. I am often lonely. Who is not?
But I should be lonelier in the heart of a city. And as Tom says,
"So much happens here." I walk at sunset, east along the road.
There are no houses in that direction, except the abandoned one
where the wild plums grow, white with bloom in springtime. I
usually walk halfway to the village and back again. No one goes,
like myself, on foot, except Bernie Bass perhaps, striding firmly
in rubber boots with his wet sack of fish over his shoulder.
Sometimes black Henry passes with a mule and wagon, taking a load
of lighter'd home to Old Boss; sometimes a neighbor's car, or the
wagon that turns off toward the turpentine woods to collect the
resin, or the timber truck coming out from the pine woods. The
white folks call "Hey!" and children wave gustily and with
pleasure. A stranger driving by usually slows down and asks
whether I want a lift. The Negroes touch a finger to their ragged
caps or pretend courteously not to see me. Evening after evening
I walk as far as the magnolias near Big Hammock, and home, and
see no one.</p>

<p>Folk call the road lonely, because there is not human traffic
and human stirring. Because I have walked it so many times and
seen such a tumult of life there, it seems to me one of the most
populous highways of my acquaintance. I have walked it in
ecstasy, and in joy it is beloved. Every pine tree, every
gall-berry bush, every passion vine, every joree rustling in the
underbrush, is vibrant. I have walked it in trouble, and the wind
in the trees beside me is easing. I have walked it in despair,
and the red of the sunset is my own blood dissolving into the
night's darkness. For all such things were on earth before us,
and will survive after us, and it is given to us to join
ourselves with them and to be comforted.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c01">1. <i>For this is an enchanted
land</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The road goes west out of the village, past open pine woods
and gallberry flats. An eagle's nest is a ragged cluster of
sticks in a tall tree, and one of the eagles is usually black and
silver against the sky. The other perches near the nest, hunched
and proud, like a griffon. There is no magic here except the
eagles. Yet the four miles to the Creek are stirring, like the
bleak, portentous beginning of a good tale. The road curves
sharply, the vegetation thickens, and around the bend masses into
dense hammock. The hammock breaks, is pushed back on either side
of the road, and set down in its brooding heart is the orange
grove. Any grove or any wood is a fine thing to see. But the
magic here, strangely, is not apparent from the road. It is
necessary to leave the impersonal highway, to step inside the
rusty gate and close it behind. By this, an act of faith is
committed, through which one accepts blindly the communion cup of
beauty. One is now inside the grove, out of one world and in the
mysterious heart of another. Enchantment lies in different things
for each of us. For me, it is in this: to step out of the bright
sunlight into the shade of orange trees; to walk under the arched
canopy of their jadelike leaves; to see the long aisles of
lichened trunks stretch ahead in a geometric rhythm; to feel the
mystery of a seclusion that yet has shafts of light striking
through it. This is the essence of an ancient and secret magic.
It goes back, perhaps, to the fairy tales of childhood, to Hansel
and Gretel, to Babes in the Wood, to Alice in Wonderland, to all
half-luminous places that pleased the imagination as a child. It
may go back still farther, to racial Druid memories, to an
atavistic sense of safety and delight in an open forest. And
after long years of spiritual homelessness, of nostalgia, here is
that mystic loveliness of childhood again. Here is home. An old
thread, long tangled, comes straight again.</p>

<p>I think that the shabbiness of the Creek is a part of its
endearing quality. I for one might admire, but never truly love,
an affluent perfection. The Williamsburg restoration, for
instance, is fine and proud, but it is something only to be
stared at. Old Williamsburg lived in a genteel poverty that was
more elegant than the new shining Governor's mansion, for its
gentility came not from superimposed wealth but from long years
of gracious living. The restoration is a good thing, of course,
and Time will make all come right again. The Creek shabbiness was
never elegant and never will be. It is merely comfortable and
weather-beaten, meeting Time halfway. I am sometimes tempted to
put up a new fence across the house yard. I have always thought
that a white picket fence must be a great comfort to a
householder. I think of the pride I should take in seeing white
paint gleaming from around the bend in the road. Then Snow the
grove man becomes quietly tired of waiting for me to do
something, and comes driving the farm truck into the yard over
the cattle-gap with a load of fresh fatwood pine posts from the
hammock.</p>

<p>He asks, "You aim just to use the old gate, don't you?"</p>

<p>I aim to use the old gate, and say so, and Snow goes ahead and
replaces the rotten and sagging posts with new ones. He tightens
the fence wire, "Hog and cattle 4-inch mesh," and the effect is
trim and eminently suitable. I tell myself that a white picket
fence would interfere with the feeling one has inside the house
of being a part of the grove; that a new fence would mean tearing
out the coral honeysuckle vines that cling passionately to the
old wire. But the real objection is that an elegant fence would
bring to the Creek a wanton orderliness that is out of place.</p>

<p>When I came to the Creek, and knew the old grove and farmhouse
at once as home, there was some terror, such as one feels in the
first recognition of a human love, for the joining of person to
place, as of person to person, is a commitment to shared sorrow,
even as to shared joy. The farmhouse was all dinginess. It sat
snugly then as now under tall old orange trees, and had a simple
grace of line, low, rambling and one-storied. But it was cracked
and gray for lack of paint, there was a tin roof that would have
ruined a mansion, and the porch was an excrescence, scarcely wide
enough for one to pass in front of the chairs. The yard was bare
sand spotted with sandspurs, with three lean Duchess rosebushes
left behind to starve, like cats. Inside the house, all the
delight of the Florida sunlight vanished. The walls were painted
a battleship gray and the floors a muddy ochre. The brick
fireplaces were walled over with tin and filled with a year's
rubbish. It was four years before the gray of the last room was
decently covered with white, money for paint being scarce, and
time so filled with other work that an hour with the brush was a
stolen pleasure. And even now, the house shining inside and out,
roofed with good gray hand-hewn cypress shingles, the long wide
screened veranda an invitation to step either inside or out, the
yard in lush green grass, there is still a look of weather-worn
shabbiness. It is a constant reminder that wind and rain and
harsh sun and the encroaching jungle are ready at any moment to
take over. I suppose that a millionaire, perhaps even just a New
Englander, might stand off the elements and maintain a trim
tidiness--and a picket fence. But the rest of the Creek would not
know what to make of it, and would be made most unhappy.</p>

<p>The battle has not gone too well for all at the Creek. One or
two have gone ahead, some hold precariously to the narrow ledge
of existence, and others have slipped back, and back, until each
day's subsistence has become a triumph. Their houses reflect
their fortunes. Mine lies the farthest east in the small
settlement. To the west are my neighbors, my friends. There have
been enmities. At the moment, we are living in unparalleled
amiability, a state at Cross Creek that, like a sinner's hope of
Heaven, is never assured. But it makes a good moment in which to
speak of other people.</p>

<p>I live within screaming distance of Tom Glisson and Old Boss
Brice. This is literal. No ordinary sound carries from one place
to the other. We hear faintly the barking of one another's dogs.
We hear the far crowing at dawn of one another's roosters.
Occasionally, when the wind is right, I hear the Brice or Glisson
cows lowing at milking time, night or morning. No voice carries,
ever. A determined scream is audible. This I proved, not in a
time of fear, but a time of fury. I should be ashamed but am not.
Of folk who would have been silent under the circumstances, there
comes to mind only St. Francis, and I believe that he might have
cast despairing eyes to Heaven.</p>

<p>I can bear much physical discomfort and a great deal of actual
pain, but now and then one achieves a combination of bodily
annoyances that makes Job's boils seem a luxury. I shall be brief
and explicit. I was entirely alone on the grove. The summer was
one of the two unbearable ones, as to heat, that I have known in
my years here. Summer is our unproductive period for vegetables.
I had been some time without them, and was afflicted with an
itching rash that I recognized too late as nutritional. The Widow
Slater and I had been repairing fences together, for I gave her
pasture for her milch cow in return for milking my own. We had
plowed through long vines of poison ivy along the decrepit fence.
Her long black flowing skirts had evidently protected her. I had
worked stockingless and in brief voile. The poison ivy had
erupted from hips to ankle, from fingertips to throat, overlaying
the rash.</p>

<p>Soothing ointments and a prone position might have brought
some ease. I was far from ointments and too busy to lie down. My
cow broke loose from the pasture and came into the grove, tearing
at the low-hanging orange boughs. I drove her out and penned her
properly, and returning to the house, found myself in the middle
of a patch of sandspurs waist-high. These barbed instruments of
torture are all the proof one needs that there is a Devil as well
as a God. I was enmeshed with sandspurs, they stuck to voile
skirt and to petticoat, creeping up underneath and getting a firm
hold with one or two barbs, leaving the others free to grate
against my skin. On normal skin they are like arrows. On a skin
covered with rash and poison ivy, they were shafts of fire. I
plucked at them as I went and came to the house. There the dogs
were waiting for me, shut on the back porch, since they had
nothing but chaos to contribute in the matter of penning a
cow.</p>

<p>I did not think they had been there very long. Even for
puppies, it did not seem too much to ask of them that they wait
like gentlemen for, say, half an hour. There were four, all told.
There was my own puppy. There were two of his litter mates that
the travelling owner had asked me to keep for him. There was old
Sport, whose huntsman master, my friend Fred, had left with me
while he fished on the east coast. I can only relate that time is
relative, and that what seemed like a short period to me, was
evidently a long, long time in the minds of three puppies. Old
Sport had become excited at their incontinence and forgotten
himself, too. The porch was a shambles. Water for cleansing had
to be brought from the outside pump, a bucket at a time. It took
twenty buckets, as I remember, and dusk was on me when I
finished.</p>

<p>I went then, the porch well cleaned, wet and glistening in the
fading light, to water my garden. There were a few carrots that I
hoped to bring through the heat, a few zinnias, half a dozen
desperate collard plants, poor things but mine own. I pulled away
sandspurs abstractedly as I carried out the watering pot. The
mosquitoes descended on me. One would think that exposed neck,
arms and face would suffice the hungriest of insects. But a
mosquito is Freudian, taking delight only in the hidden places.
They wavered with their indecisive flight up under my skirts and
stabbed me in the poison ivy, in the nutritional rash, around the
sandspurs, and settled with hums of joy in all unoccupied small
spaces. It was too much. I set down the watering pot, and with no
thought of help for my distress, for I was past helping, let out
shriek after shriek of sheer indulgent frustration. As I say, St.
Francis might have blessed the puppies and old Sport and the
mosquitoes, with a kind word thrown in for the sandspurs, but I
am not of the stuff of saints. I screamed. The screaming
satisfied me. I finished the watering, went into the house, fed
the dogs, made myself a supper, and went to the veranda to
meditate. As I sat, exhausted but content, two figures strolled
cautiously up the road and paused in front of my gate. It was Tom
Glisson and Old Boss.</p>

<p>Old Boss called, "Everything all right?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I said. "Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>Tom said, "Seemed to us like we heard somebody call for help.
We just wondered, was everything all right."</p>

<p>I hesitated. After all, there was nothing to be done, and at
the moment, it seemed, all was too embarrassing to be told.</p>

<p>"I was singing," I said. "Perhaps you heard me--singing."</p>

<p>"Oh," they said, and turned and walked home again.</p>

<p>So I say that I live within screaming distance of my nearest
neighbors.</p>

<p>Old Boss' grove joins up with mine. We share an east-west
fence line and a double row of spite trees. The spite is none of
our doing, but an inheritance from earlier owners of the
adjoining groves. There was a day, before the Big Freeze of
'94-5, when oranges were truly golden apples, bringing, in their
rareness, incredible sums. Suitable orange land was considered
worth its weight in gold. So the two unfriendly neighbors planted
their orange trees, each as close to the joint fence as possible,
to get all the good of the priceless soil. The result is that two
lines of scrawny trees send out their roots futilely in search of
sufficient nourishment. Among large trees, there are few of whom
two can live as cheaply as one.</p>

<p>Old Boss wandered down to Florida from Georgia as a boy,
nearly sixty years ago. He came down to die, he told me once, and
wanted to die in the tropical sunshine. He is still a frail
little man, but I think he drew sustenance from the sun and earth
and the fruiting trees around him. He clerked in a country store
in the village and became the owner. He yearned always for the
Creek, he said. At last he took over the neglected grove on an
unpaid mortgage and moved out. It means to him precisely what it
means to me, and we sometimes sit together on his back porch and
just look about us and say nothing. We seldom meet, but when we
see each other down the road, we wave, and I know that the same
warm feeling comes over the old man that comes to me. He has been
father, arbiter, disciplinarian to all the Negroes who have ever
lived or worked here. I challenged his authority on one occasion,
but that is another story. His house is a rococco two-story
affair, tall and gangling like an antique spinster. There is
bamboo in the sandy yard, and hibiscus and allamanda, and a
pittosporum that is so old it is not a shrub, but a great tree,
covered in spring with minute flowers of a strange exotic scent.
The house is on the opposite side of the road from mine, just out
of sight.</p>

<p>Tom Glisson lives on the same side of the road as I do, and
opposite Old Boss. Tom has prospered. He and his wife are Georgia
folk, too, and as hard workers as I have ever known. I am not at
all sure that Tom can read or write, but he talks well, with a
flair for the picturesque and the dramatic. He was put to the
plow when he was so small he could scarcely reach the plow
handles, he told me. He was given no education.</p>

<p>"I made up my mind," he said, "my young uns would get a better
chance than their daddy."</p>

<p>It has been good to see the three children grow tall and
bright and handsome. The oldest boy even had a year at the
University. The youngest, "J. T.," was a tragic little cripple
when I first knew him. I would see him hobbling down the road on
his crooked legs, with the luminous expression on his face that
seems peculiar to those we call the "afflicted." Tom and his wife
were not of the breed to accept an evil that could be changed,
and they worked day and night to save money to send the boy away
for braces and treatments. Now he too is tall and strong, and I
saw him ride by yesterday on his own dwarf-mule, talking to
himself and lifting his hand to an invisible audience. He was, I
knew, the Lone Ranger or perhaps Buck Rogers, but he took time
out courteously from his duties to call "Hey!" to me, then
returned to his important and secret activities.</p>

<p>The Glisson house is small and brown, well kept, and the yard
has been slowly given shrubs and even a bit of grass. Tom raises
hogs and some cattle, has built up a little grove, and he and his
wife do anything profitable they can turn their hands to. They
have fought ill health as well as poverty, and it is sometimes
hard to feel sympathy for what seem offhand less fortunate
people, knowing what can be done with courage and hard work and
thrift. Tom and I began with a strange mistrust of each other,
and had some harsh encounters. I was in the wrong, and that is a
story, too, and now I know him for a friend and would turn to him
in any trouble.</p>

<p>There are no further houses until you take the sharp curve in
the road that sweeps down to the Creek itself. There is a patch
of thick hammock, an open field, and then, on the right, old
Joe's abandoned house. Old Joe Mackay is the last of a good
farming family. The Mackay acres were well-tilled and profitable
some fifty years ago. There has been no regular cultivation for
years, though now and then lately some farmer from the village
rents the largest cleared field to raise some special crop. Old
Joe lived alone in the old Mackay house. He is ageless in
appearance, small and stooped and wiry, with his thin face ruddy
from being on Orange Lake in every sort of weather. He runs a
catfish line for a living. The house is as silver gray as the
speckled perch he sometimes catches. It is a tall box of a house
and even in its desertion maintains a look of sturdy livability.
It was a good house in its day. Something about it is beautiful,
its color most of all, and tall palms bend over it, and there are
live oaks and holly and a few orange trees around it, and the
hammock is a soft curtain beyond it. It was because he had a
house that he was able to get a wife. His good friend Tom
Morrison found a very pretty widow. He married the pretty widow
to Old Joe, and Tom and Old Joe and the widow and the widow's
children lived happily in the house.</p>

<p>Tom said, "Somebody has to look out for Old Joe."</p>

<p>I suppose the roof leaked, as old roofs do. The cockroaches
may have become too abundant in the walls and floors. At any
rate, the contented family left the house a few years ago and
moved a hundred yards closer to the Creek, into the abandoned
church on the same side of the road. They put up partitions to
make rooms, moved the old pews out into the yard and swept out
the hymnbooks. The church has made a fine home. It sits under a
magnificent live oak and is cozy in winter and cool in
summer.</p>

<p>The old Mackay house was turned over for a time to Aunt Martha
Mickens and her husband, Old Will. It was agreed that Martha and
Will, progenitors of all the colored help that had ever been at
the Creek, should be brought back home again. Old Joe's wife
found Martha good company when she was alone. There was trouble,
and Martha and Will were obliged to leave, and that again is a
story. The old Mackay house is now tenantless. But it is still
hospitable, and when some family in the environs finds itself
temporarily roofless, it moves in for a time, and then moves on
again. The house has sheltered a slow stream of deserted husbands
and wives with large numbers of children, homeless for the
moment.</p>

<p>At an angle from the bend in the road is a deep sand road that
leads through hammock, and past the north edge of Old Boss'
grove, to another house. The house is not the same one that was
there when I first came to the Creek. It seems as though one
house, one family, is all the dusky break in the forest will
tolerate. The house I used to know belonged to Old Boss and was
inhabited by the Widow Slater and her brood. The Slater house
lived from rain to rain and the Slaters from hand to mouth. The
Widow moved back to Carolina with her "chappies," leaving Snow
behind, and in time he became my grove-man and co-worrier over
the hazardous fortunes of my grove. The Slater house, stricken of
the moral support of human occupancy, fell promptly to the
ground. Now there is another small house up the deep hammock
road. The Bernie Basses live there.</p>

<p>This makes up the white population of the Creek. Across the
lovely Creek itself, over the narrow bridge, are scattered in a
migratory flux two or three other families. We do not say of them
that they live "at" the Creek but that they live "beyond" it. Mr.
Martin is a newcomer. He has prospered and I presume he is here
to stay. It looked at one time as though the Creek area were too
small to hold both me and Mr. Martin. If Mr. Martin had put me
under the jail, as he threatened, or sent me to eternity by way
of gunshot, as he wanted, I should have made an effort to take
his big burly body along to either place with me. We have become
good friends. I was never angry with Mr. Martin. He was only
angry with me.</p>

<p>Past Mr. Martin's place have been Mr. Swilley and George
Fairbanks and the Townsends and Mr. Marsh Turner. Mr. Swilley has
gone of late to a widow and Mr. Marsh Turner has gone to Hell. I
know he is in Hell by his own choice. And even if the Angel
Gabriel forgave his sins, as his friends did, and called him to
Heaven, that peaceful and virtuous stamping ground would above
all be Hell to Marsh. George Fairbanks drifts from cabin to cabin
and the Townsends drift from one new baby to another. They have a
young un, as we say, every time the woods burn, and each one is
welcome and a fresh surprise.</p>

<p>The colored population of the Creek has the solid base of the
Mickens family, against which other transient Negroes surge and
retreat. When old Martha Mickens shall march at last through the
walls of Jericho, shouting her Primitive Baptist hymns, a dark
rock at the core of the Creek life will have been shattered to
bits. She is nurse to any of us, black or white, who fall ill.
She is midwife and layer out of the dead. She is the only one who
gives advice to all of us impartially. She is a dusky Fate,
spinning away at the threads of our Creek existence.</p>

<h2><a name="c02">2. <i>Taking up the slack</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It is always bewildering to change one's complete way of life.
I was fitted by temperament and by inheritance for farm and
country living, yet to take it up after some thirty years of
urban life was not too easy. I had known my maternal
grandfather's Michigan farm, but there I was both guest and
child, and the only duties were to gather the eggs from the
sweet-smelling hayloft. I had known my father's Maryland farm,
but that farm was his love, his escape from Washington
governmental routine, and we lived there only in the too few
summers. I had no duties there at all. There was only delight;
the flowering locust grove; the gentle cows in pasture; Rock
Creek, which ran, ten miles away from its Washington park, at the
foot of the hill of the locusts, where my brother and I learned
to swim and to fish for tiny and almost untakable fishes; long
walks with my father through the woods where he hoped some day to
build a home; jaunts with him behind Old Dan in the carriage, to
the county seat of Rockville, or to buy mules at Frederick. These
things got in the blood but were no preparation for running a
farm oneself. When I bought the Florida orange grove with my
inheritance that represented my share of the Maryland farm, my
father's sister Madeline wrote me in lament.</p>

<p>"You have in you," she said, "that fatal drop of Pearce blood,
clamoring for change and adventure, and above all, for a farm. I
never knew a Pearce who didn't secretly long for a farm. Mother
had one, Uncle Pierman was ruined by one, there was your father's
tragic experience. I had one, once--"</p>

<p>I see no reason for denying so fundamental an urge, ruin or
no. It is more important to live the life one wishes to live, and
to go down with it if necessary, quite contentedly, than to live
more profitably but less happily. Yet to achieve content under
sometimes adverse circumstances, requires first an adjustment
within oneself, and this I had already made, and after that, a
recognition that one is not unique in being obliged to toil and
struggle and suffer. This is the simplest of all facts and the
most difficult for the individual ego to accept. As I look back
on those first difficult times at the Creek, when it seemed as
though the actual labor was more than I could bear, and the
making of a living on the grove impossible, it was old black
Martha who drew aside a curtain and led me in to the company of
all those who had loved the Creek and been tormented by it.</p>

<p>Martha welcomed me with old-fashioned formality. She came
walking toward me in the grove one bright sunny December day. I
turned to watch her magnificent carriage. It was erect, with a
long free graceful stride. It was impossible to tell her age. She
walked like a very young woman and walks so to this day. She is
getting on to seventy, yet glimpsing her down the road she might
be a girl. She was dressed neatly in calico, with a handkerchief
bound around her head, bandana fashion. She was a rich smooth
brown. She came directly to me and inclined her head.</p>

<p>She said, "I come to pay my respecks. I be's Martha. Martha
Mickens."</p>

<p>I said, "How do you do, Martha."</p>

<p>She said, "I wants to welcome you. Me and my man, Old Will,
was the first hands on this place. Time the grove was planted, me
and Will worked here. It's home to me."</p>

<p>"Where do you live now?"</p>

<p>"T' other side o' the Creek. We too old now to do steady work,
but I just wants to tell you, any time you gets in a tight, us is
here to do what we can."</p>

<p>"How long has it been since you worked here on the grove?"</p>

<p>"Sugar," she said, "I got no way o' tellin' the years. The
years comes and the years goes. It's been a long time."</p>

<p>"Was it the Herberts you worked for?"</p>

<p>"Yessum. They was mighty fine folks. They's been fine folks
here since and they's been trash. But Sugar, the grove ain't
trash, and the Creek be's trashified here and there, but it's the
Creek right on. I purely loves the Creek."</p>

<p>I said, "I love it, too."</p>

<p>"Does you? Then you'll make out. I reckon you know, you got to
be satisfied with a place to make out. And is you satisfied, then
it don't make too much difference does you make out or no."</p>

<p>We laughed together.</p>

<p>She said, "Heap o' folks has lived here. Ain't nobody has
lived here since the Herberts but had to scratch and scramble.
The ones loved it, stayed 'til death or sich takened 'em away.
The ones ain't loved it, has moved on like the wind moves."</p>

<p>I said, "The grove hasn't always made a living, then."</p>

<p>"Tends on what you calls a livin'. To get yo' grease an' grits
in the place you enjoys gettin' 'em, ain't that makin' a
livin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then lemme tell you. Ain't nobody never gone cold-out hongry
here. I'se seed the grove freeze to the ground. I'se seed it
swivvel in a long drought. But Sugar, they was grove here before
my folks crossed the big water. They was wild grove here as long
back as tongue can tell. Durin' the war for freedom the white
ladies used to drive out here in wagons and pick the wild oranges
to squeeze out the juice and send it to the sojers. And they'll
be grove here right on, after you and me is forgotten. They'll be
good land to plow, and mast in the woods for hogs, and ain't no
need to go hongry. All the folks here ahead o' you has fit cold
and wind and dry weather, but ain't nary one of 'em has goed
hongry."</p>

<p>Hunger at the moment was not immediate, but when it menaced
later, I remembered the things the old black woman said, and I
was comforted, sensing that one had only to hold tight to the
earth itself and its abundance. And if others could fight
adversity, so might I.</p>

<p>"I won't keep you," she said. "I jes' wanted to tell you I was
here."</p>

<p>She bobbed her head and went away.</p>

<p>She lived at the time four miles away, across the Creek, in an
old gray house immaculately kept, with oleanders and dogwood in
the clean bare yard. She had always "porch plants" about, grown
from slips, of geranium and aspidistra; fuchsia, "the Georgia
flower," sansivaria and elephant-ear and impatient Sultana, all
blooming lushly in containers of old tin. She walked the four
miles back and forth to help in the bean field or the cucumber
patch, to nurse the sick, to wash and clean for Old Boss or the
Mackays or, as time went on, for me.</p>

<p>About her, the nucleus, were her sons and daughters and their
wives and husbands, who worked transiently for the rest of us.
The best of her daughters, to my personal knowledge, is Estelle.
There is a very elegant daughter who works for a wealthy family
outside of Baltimore, and of her I know nothing, except that she
sends her mother good clothes not too much worn. Estelle and her
husband Sam worked many years for Old Boss. They lived at the
edge of the road and were patient and faithful, except that Sam
had an unwonted impudence "under the influence." A son-in-law of
Old Boss was somehow unable to deal with Sam, and in a huff he
took Estelle and moved off to Hawthorn. Estelle is gentle and
soft-spoken like her mother.</p>

<p>For a long time I knew of Zamilla only that she was "the one
what got shot." I pictured a leaf-brown hussy subject to
brawling, whose wild life finally caught up with her. I was never
more mistaken. When Sam and Estelle cleared out in righteous
indignation, Old Boss notified Martha that it was up to her to
replace her delinquent offspring. Henry and Sissie appeared on
the scene and took over the small cabin. Sissie, too, was gentle,
bearing Henry's abuse when he was drunk and, absurdly, jealous.
One day I discovered that Sissie was the wounded Zamilla, shot
innocently in a jook from which she was trying to extricate her
husband. The shot was probably intended for Henry, and much as I
like him, sober, I know of no darky who more deserves shooting
when drunk.</p>

<p>Adrenna is a daughter whose life became so involved with mine
that I have wondered where one ended and the other began. She was
a lean angular creature whom at first I took to be a girl, but
found to be of my own age. She was shingle-butted, but what there
was of butt stuck out sharply. She was a <i>femme fatale,</i> and
I have never been able to identify any possible appeal she might
have for the colored men, unless it be that little square boxlike
rear. She was careless in her dress and cleanliness, to Martha's
distress, and mine, and usually wore her hair in Topsy pigtails
that stuck out around her face like a halo. She could seduce any
man she wanted, for the moment, but she could not hold them, or,
if they were faithful, she grew tired of them. She did my work
for several years and there was true love and exasperation
between us. Our involvement came through her attempts to capture
a husband. The husband must serve a dual purpose. He must provide
her with whatever she wanted of a husband, and me with a good
grove and yard man. Adrenna and I fell constantly between the
upper and the nether millstone.</p>

<p>"Little Will" Mickens, her brother, is my grove man at this
instant, and while all seems well, I can guarantee nothing by the
time this chronicle goes to press. Other sons and daughters of
Martha are scattered here and there through the state.</p>

<p>"I was a fast-breedin' woman," Martha says with dignity and
without apology. Such things are elemental, a matter of fact. "I
got sympathy for a woman is a fast-breeder."</p>

<p>When any of the daughters working at the Creek are ill or
absent or brought to child-bed, or the sons or husbands are drunk
and cannot do their work, Martha takes their places. Last winter
a freeze menaced and Little Will was taken suddenly drunk. Martha
came without notice to gather Spanish moss to cover the flower
plants in my garden. I drove in from town and found her bending
over the plants.</p>

<p>"I always likes to take up the slack," she said.</p>

<p>There have been occasions when her slack-taking has been so
zealous as better to have gone untaken. I left the Creek for a
vacation at a beach cottage seventy miles away. Adrenna left
behind by accident six napkins that I had picked up at the dime
store for twenty cents. The morning after our arrival at the
cottage, my farm truck clattered up to the door. Little Will
presented me breathlessly with a neatly wrapped package.</p>

<p>"Mama sont me to carry you these. She say she jes' know you
wanted 'em. She say, tell you you don't never need worry when
Adrenna forget things. She see you gets 'em."</p>

<p>The parcel contained the twenty cents' worth of napkins. The
round trip for the truck stood me several dollars. Will had left
the grove fertilizing in the very middle, while the extra hands
must sit idle, waiting for the return of the truck to move the
fertilizer. I accepted the napkins and sent him on his way. Two
hours later he returned on foot. The truck had broken a spring on
a rough back road. I was editing a story to meet a magazine
deadline and was obliged to drop my work, arrange for a new
spring and a repairman from the nearest city. The job cost
fifteen dollars, the details filled my day, and it was night
before Little Will reached the grove again. I take a rueful
satisfaction in using the flimsy napkins, saying to friends,
"Please be careful. These napkins are worth about six dollars
apiece." My only dividend on the investment is their puzzled
expression at my bad taste and the obvious worthlessness of the
napkins. I take no more chances on Martha's slack-taking.
Whenever I leave the Creek for the beach, I say, "If we leave
anything behind, do not send the truck with it." I have probably
deprived her of many triumphs in despatching a pound of butter or
a magazine by farm express.</p>

<p>We call Martha "old-timey." That means specifically that to
our white faces she presents a low-voiced deference, to our backs
an acute criticism, and to the colored world a tongue before
which it bows as before a flail. She has an inviolable sense of
proportion. It comes of the gift, and I think it is a gift, that
many of her alleged superiors do not possess, of seeing people as
they are. Wealth does not impress her, on the rare occasions when
she encounters it. "Fame" is a word without meaning. Those few of
the worldly great who have paused briefly at the Creek have
passed before her silent appraisal as they must pass that of St.
Peter. On the other hand, the poorest tramp receives a kind word
from her if she senses in him that integrity that even the most
unfortunate often possess. I fed one such one day, for at the
Creek the hungry have a great claim on us. The ragged creature
blessed me as he went away with his full stomach and small
gifts.</p>

<p>"It will all come back to you," he said, "many times
over."</p>

<p>It was of course the ancient response of the mendicant,
through whom the charitable curry favor in the sight of the gods,
but the man had something more.</p>

<p>Martha said, "That ain't no beggar. That's a person."</p>

<p>She has her own standards of payment for services rendered.
She accepts nothing from those too poor to pay. When I came to my
own lean period, and found that I could not carry all the manual
labor alone, she washed and cleaned for me, at the current rate
of ten cents an hour. She would not cheapen herself by loitering
over her work, to draw a higher pay, and was always finished in a
few hours. I paid her the small sums with guilt and necessity.
She accepted with infinite politeness. Now, when accident has
raised my fortunes, I pay her generously for the smallest labors,
and she accepts the over-pay with equal understanding. Who knows
better than she that one pays as one can, and that the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away? Blessed be the name of the
Lord.</p>

<p>None of her get is of the same stuff as her own. If she were
white I should call her a natural aristocrat, and I see no reason
to withhold the adjective because of color or race. She is
illiterate, she can tell a judicious lie when necessary, she does
not know sterling silver from aluminum, and scours old English
Sheffield along with the cooking pots and pans. But she is
well-bred. Breeding is after all a matter of manner, of social
adjustment, of exquisite courtesy. Perhaps she is descended from
old African kings and queens. At any rate, the hallmark is on
her.</p>

<p>Old Will, her husband, some ten years older than she, is
almost of her breed. He has the arrogance of the elite but not
the graciousness. Many of the quarrels at the Creek have been of
his instigating. Perhaps he too came of a regal line but a more
belligerent one. He looks for all the world like Uncle Tom, with
grizzled hair and whiskers, and walks with a cane. The cane is a
badge of his independence, indicating that he is frail and cannot
or will not stoop to labor. But he was a hard worker in his day
and made money on cotton and at share-cropping of all sorts. When
I am his age, if I have no other subsistence, I think that I too
shall walk with a cane and accept a livelihood as my right, after
years of toiling.</p>

<p>Martha is a Primitive, or foot-washing, Baptist, militant and
certain of her doctrines. She does not go often to church only
because there is none nearby of her denomination. There was a
Primitive Baptist church across the Creek when I first came, but
the leader absconded with the hard-saved church funds, and his
house, which was also the meeting-house, was quite properly
struck by lightning and burned to the ground by the wrath of the
Lord. Martha is an inexhaustible fount of old spirituals. When we
get hungry for song, she gathers several of her family together,
lines them up in a row and "leads off." Her voice is high and
reedlike and utterly true. The other voices weave in and out of
her melody, sometimes only humming, for some of the songs are so
rare and old that only she is familiar with the words. Her
favorite, and mine, is "Come, Mary, toll the bell." For this, she
throws back her kerchiefed head, closes her eyes, pats her foot
and accompanies herself with an intricate syncopation of hand
clapping. Rhythm-minded friends attempt to follow her timing,
charmed by its perfection, and can never duplicate the fine
shading of beats. Her son-in-law Henry is her favorite to sing
with her, for he too knows many of the old songs, and has a rich
sweet bass that ripples like velvet under the silver of her
voice. Unfortunately Henry is often in disfavor and we must sing
without him. It is of no use ever for me to ask him to sing "St.
Louis Blues" or "Coon-shine Baby."</p>

<p>"Mama don't let me sing them low-down songs where she can hear
it," he says.</p>

<p>I wonder often what she thinks of the mysterious business that
is my writing. Once in the midst of creative difficulties, I said
facetiously, "Martha, I'm in trouble. I'll do the washing if
you'll write this chapter for me."</p>

<p>"Sugar," she said gravely, "God knows I'd do it if I
could."</p>

<p>I recall the time I rang late for my breakfast coffee. It
seemed necessary to apologize for the hour, for at the Creek one
is not quite decent who is not up with the red-birds.</p>

<p>I said, "I'm sorry to be so late. I worked very late last
night at my writing."</p>

<p>She said compassionately, "Oh Sugar, I knows you're tired in
the arms."</p>

<p>There is indeed much writing that sounds as though the only
possible fatigue to the author were manual, but working as I do
with great mental anguish, I could hope that a trace of
cerebration might register, even for Martha. Pride pricked me, I
think, or the need of self-justification that Martha is likely to
impose on one, and that day I showed her my published books. She
recognized my picture on a jacket and turned the unintelligible
pages with a cautious black finger. She put her hands on her hips
and threw back her head.</p>

<p>"Sugar," she said, "they ain't nobody at Cross Creek can do
that."</p>

<h2><a name="c03">3. <i>The magnolia tree</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I do not know the irreducible minimum of happiness for any
other spirit than my own. It is impossible to be certain even of
mine. Yet I believe that I know my tangible desideratum. It is a
tree-top against a patch of sky. If I should lie crippled or long
ill, or should have the quite conceivable misfortune to be
clapped in jail, I could survive, I think, given this one token
of the physical world. I know that I lived on one such in my
first days at the Creek.</p>

<p>The tree was a magnolia, taller than the tallest orange trees
around it. There is no such thing in the world as an ugly tree,
but the <i>magnolia grandiflora</i> has a unique perfection. No
matter how crowded it may be, no matter how thickly holly and
live oak and sweet gum may grow up around it, it develops with
complete symmetry, so that one wonders whether character in all
things, human as well as vegetable, may not be implicit. Neither
is its development ruthless, achieved at the expense of its
neighbors, for it is one of the few trees that may be allowed to
stand in an orange grove, seeming to steal nothing from the
expensively nourished citrus. The young of the tree is courteous,
waiting for the parent to be done with life before presuming to
take it over. There are never seedling magnolias under or near an
old magnolia. When the tree at last dies, the young glossy
sprouts appear from nowhere, exulting in the sun and air for
which they may have waited a long hundred years.</p>

<p>The tree is beautiful the year around. It need not wait for a
brief burst of blooming to justify itself, like the wild plum and
the hawthorn. It is handsomer than most dressed only in its broad
leaves, shining like dark polished jade, so that when I am
desperate for decoration, I break a few sprays for the house and
find them an ornament of which a Japanese artist would approve.
The tree sheds some of its leaves just before it blooms, as
though it shook off old garments to be cleansed and ready for the
new. There is a dry pattering to earth of the hard leaves and for
a brief time the tree is parched and drawn, the rosy-lichened
trunk gray and anxious. Then pale green spires cover the boughs,
unfolding into freshly lacquered leaves, and at their tips the
blooms appear. When, in late April or early May, the pale buds
unfold into great white waxy blossoms, sometimes eight or ten
inches across, and the perfume is a delirious thing on the spring
air, I would not trade one tree for a conservatory filled with
orchids. The blooms, for all their size and thickness, are as
delicate as orchids in that they reject the touch of human hands.
They must be cut or broken carefully and placed in a jar of water
without brushing the edges, or the creamy petals will turn in an
hour to brown velvet. Properly handled, they open in the house as
on the tree, the cupped buds bursting open suddenly, the
fullblown flowers shedding the red-tipped stamens in a shower, so
that in a quiet room you hear them sifting onto the table top.
The red seed cones are as fine as candles. They mature slowly
from the top of the tree down, as a Christmas tree is
lighted.</p>

<p>Because I miss the flowers when the blooming season is over, I
begged my artist friend Robert to paint a spray on my old Tole
tray. He rebelled, being a true artist who is annoyed by owners'
specifications, and wanted to do a stylized landscape on the
tray. I sulked and grumbled, and as sulky as I, at last he began
the magnolias. He put on a few white daubs and growled some more
and let the months pass. Then the magnolia season came around,
and he had a jug of the blooms in his studio, and my battle was
won. The magnolias were irresistible. Now I have them,
imperishable at least for my lifetime, with the inexplicable
added loveliness that true art gives to reality. Unfortunately,
the tray is now too fine a work of art to put back on its low
table, where the convivial and the careless will set down their
damp silver julep cups. I have the alternatives of taking it to
bed with me, or hanging it inappropriately on the farmhouse wall,
or following my guests about like a secret service agent, ready
to snatch up the dripping symbols of my hospitality from off the
white breasts of the magnolias.</p>

<p>The tree that nourished me in a lean time is still here and
will be as long as I can protect it from everything short of
lightning. It is not conspicuous when walking through the grove.
It comes into its own from the west kitchen window beside the
sink. The high window frames it, so that its dark glossy top is
singled out for the attention of one standing there, washing
dishes, preparing vegetables, rolling pie crust on the table
under the window, putting a cake together. The sun sets behind it
and is tangled in the branches. In the days when the life and the
work at the Creek were new, and the three brothers, for whom the
pattern proved within a year to be not the right one, seemed
three bottomless capacities for food, and there was no domestic
help, the hours by the west window were endless, and the magnolia
never failed of its beauty and its comfort. One wanted to cut it
down, believing that it sapped the nourishment of the orange
trees around it, but another laughed and upheld me, and it was
left to raise its leaves, its blossoms, its red cones, to the
changing sky. Now oranges scarcely pay for their care and their
picking and shipping, and we know that magnolias, like palm
trees, are good things in a grove, breeding and harboring many
friendly parasites, and I have been alone a long time, and the
magnolia tree is still here.</p>

<p>The matter of adjustment to physical environment is as
fascinating as the adjustment of man to man, and as many-sided.
The place that is right for one is wrong for another, and I think
that much human unhappiness comes from ignoring the primordial
relation of man to his background. Certainly the creatures are
sensitive to this, and while some seem contented almost anywhere
as long as food is provided, and perhaps a mate, others cannot
accept the change of scene or the cage. Monkeys, I think, do not
mind the zoo, but the eagle hunched on his public perch, the
panther behind his bars, break the heart with their desperation.
My own two animals who came to the Creek with me from urban life
reacted as opposites. They were a Scottish terrier, a shy fellow,
and a young tiger cat, both city-bred and reared. Both knew town
apartment life, the sound of city traffic and the small bed at
night behind safe walls. Both had been happy in that life.</p>

<p>Dinghy the Scotty hated the Florida backwoods from the first
sandspur under his tail. He hated the sun, he hated the people,
black and white, he hated the roominess of the farm-house and the
long quiet of the nights. From the beginning, he sat on his fat
Scotch behind and glowered. Perhaps he sensed that his breed and
pedigree were not here properly appreciated. Florida is a country
of the work-dog, even where that dog is a pointer or setter and
so something, always, of a pet. We live a leisurely life, but
while our dogs lie, as we, in the sun, they are also expected to
serve us, as the Negro serves. Dinghy was not approved. He was
not even understood. There were those who did not believe he was
a dog. The iceman professed to be in deadly fear of him. I took
Dinghy in the car with me to Hawthorn for groceries, and the
clerk came to put the packages in the car. He retreated,
shrieking, "There's a varmint in that car!" I am certain that if
Dinghy did not know what was meant by a varmint, he knew that
humans were not impressed by him. He was accustomed to slavish
overtures, the proffered tidbit and the friendly touch. He
retired into his mental Highlands and stayed there.</p>

<p>Jib, his tabby companion, was of different stuff. He too had
lived the languid life of a city pet, in the house most of the
time, fed on ground beef and liver from the butcher, his only
excitement an occasional excursion into the back yard after some
intrepid city mouse. I was so busy when I took up life at the
Creek that Jib was left to shift for himself. He had his warm
milk fresh from old Laura, night and morning, but that was all.
And where Dinghy turned into a hopeless introvert, Jib
thrived.</p>

<p>The jungle that was a terror to the dog was to him enchanting.
All the generations of urban life were dissolved in a moment, and
he prowled the marsh and hammock as though he had known them
always. He returned home with shining eyes, bearing some trophy
unutterably strange, a lizard or small snake. We use the
expression here, "poor as a lizard-eating cat," and I think Jib
learned they were not the healthiest of foods, for as the years
passed I would see him lying in the shade, watching a lizard with
no attempt to catch it. He must once have been bitten by a snake,
for he disappeared for two days, and came in with his head
swollen to twice its size, and very wobbly on his legs. He
refused food for two days more and then was himself again, but
with a holy fear of anything resembling the serpent. I have seen
him jump three feet in the air, like a released spring, at the
sudden sight of a curving stick or a ribbon on the floor.</p>

<p>He seemed to sense the unhappiness of Dinghy and made a great
effort to teach the Scotty the new delights he had discovered. He
brought his lizards to the melancholy Scot and was puzzled by his
disgust. He spent hours trying to teach Dinghy to catch a mouse.
He would cripple it, cat-fashion, and release it under the dog's
nose. Dinghy would move a few morose inches away. Jib would pick
up the mouse and push it under Dinghy's belly with one paw, then
sit back and wait hopefully for the mouse to slip away and Dinghy
to pounce, as any rational animal would do. The mouse would begin
its escape and Dinghy would look the other way. At last, with
evident lack of relish, Jib would kill and eat his mouse.</p>

<p>Dinghy was returned to the city, lived happily in a bed-indoor
apartment filled with the commotion of newspaper people, and
fathered many broods of equally haughty and urban Scottish
terriers. I am sure that if he had stayed in Florida he would
have sired no progeny, out of sheer boredom. Old Jib has lived to
be a veritable Egyptian mummy of a cat, lean and dessicated, with
an eye cocked to watch the birds and the chameleons he has not
disturbed for many years. Life will be for him always a lively
matter, even when it is reduced to mere speculation. I drove over
the cattle-gap into the grove late one night recently, and my
lights shone two bright pairs of eyes, one on either side of the
driveway. Old Jib was curled comfortably there, watching with
friendly interest an opossum who had come by on his night's
business.</p>

<p>There was more of Jib's response to the jungle than of
Dinghy's in my own feeling about it. It will always seem strange
to me, and though I live to be as thin and dried as he, I shall
go into its shadows with a faster heart-beat, as Jib must have
gone. Even with my first fear, long since vanished, there was
more of excitement, and this is a thing I should not choose to
have leave me about anything glamorous and lovely. I was most
stirred, I think, by knowing that this was Indian and Spanish
country, and that Vitachuco, chief of the Ocali Indians, was
embroiled with the Spaniards somewhere north of the present
Ocala--and it may have been here. The word "hammock" comes from
the Spanish "hamaca," meaning "a highly arable type of soil." I
wanted to name my book "Golden Apples," "Hamaca," and to indicate
the triumphs and defeats that different kinds of men have
encountered in this hammock country, but it was believed that the
name would be so strange no one would buy the book.</p>

<p>I like to think of the Spaniards blazing their trails through
the Florida hammocks. The hammocks were the same then as now, and
will be the same forever if men can be induced to leave them
alone. Hammock soil is dark and rich, made up of centuries of
accumulation of humus from the droppings of leaves. The hammock
is marked by its type of trees, and these are the live oak, the
palm, the sweet gum, the holly, the ironwood and the hickory and
magnolia. We have high hammock and low hammock, and oak hammock
and palm hammock, and there is likely to be a body of water
nearby. The piney woods and the flat-woods are more open and
therefore perhaps more hospitable, in spite of their poorer soil
and dryness, but the <i>hamaca</i> shares with marsh and swamp
the great mystery of Florida.</p>

<p>When I had caught the swing of the work so that there was now
and then a breathing spell, I moved beyond the orbit of the
magnolia tree seen from the kitchen window, and began to learn
the hammock and lake edge that with the grove made up my
seventy-two acres. I have since bought forty acres from the Widow
Lowry, worthless marsh and low hammock that adjoin my east grove,
from that peculiar instinct, relic no doubt of pioneer farming
ancestors, that makes a landowner want to "round out his block."
The grove itself seems safe and open, no matter how high the
tea-weed grows, and the red-top. There are times when the evening
sun infiltrates so eerily the dense summer cover crop under the
orange trees that the green growth seems, not vegetation, but
sea, emerald green, with the light seeming to come from high
distant earthly places down through the luminous waters. Yet the
effect is open.</p>

<p>The old sixteen-acre field is open, too. It is reached through
Old Boss' grove, and I remember the sense of discovery when I
went through the sagging gate back of his house and came out into
the old clearing. It is a fine sweep of field, level for ten
acres, dropping to the east to a line of hickories, and to the
north melting into a dense six acres of virgin hammock. In the
heart of the clearing is a gigantic live oak, with crepe myrtle
bushes nearby, and an old well, and though there is not a trace
left of any house, one knows this was a home-site, and that
children swung from the low-spreading limbs of the oak tree. The
field has lost its fertility, and I have struggled with
successive optimistic plantings of beans and squash and cucumbers
and even, hopeful folly on that neglected soil, young orange
trees. But the field is through with the bother of cultivation
and will have none of it, and everything withers on its arid and
cynical and weary breast. It nourishes only a thick cluster of
persimmon trees and wild grapevines, and a spindling grapefruit
tree at the edge of the hammock, and a great sweet seedling
orange tree among the hickories. The squirrels and raccoons and
birds and foxes make a good living there, where a human
fails.</p>

<p>The east grove, across the road from the farmhouse, is bounded
on the east and south by hammock. This lies around it in a
protective crescent. Entering here is a trek into the wilderness.
Boots and breeches are required, for the way goes through saw
palmettos and is part of the trail where, Tom Morrison says, the
snakes cross. Twice each year the moccasins and rattlers move, he
says, taking the same path, and back and forth between the east
and west groves is a known crossing. It must be so, for I see
more snakes on the road there than in any other place I frequent.
Once through the dense palmettos the hammock opens out, so that
where the old Lowry fence runs the woods make a clear park. There
are tall long-leaf pines among the palms and live oaks, so that
the earth has a clean carpet of pine needles and brittle oak
leaves, and one walks silently over it. The bluejays nest there,
and the hush is broken only by their cries, harsh above the soft
slurring of the wind in the tree-tops. I began my hunting there,
practicing with a .410 on the gray squirrels that whisked up and
down the tree trunks. There was great sport at first in all the
hunting. Then it came to sicken me, and now I go to the pines as
a guest and not an invader. The squirrels strip half a dozen
pecan trees of their crop each fall, but there are a dozen trees
more, and when a gray streak of fur flashes by my window of an
autumn morning on its way to the rich nuts, I say to it, "Come in
and welcome. There is enough for us all."</p>

<p>Down through the west grove, which is the house grove, is the
hammock on the shore of Orange Lake that has been from the
beginning a true retreat. I went to it often in the early days
but have not gone much since life itself has had more to offer.
This has been not for disloyalty or for any treachery, but
because at all times we turn to what we need only when we need
it. It is a matter of indifference to the lake-shore hammock
whether I come or go, and so I went to it in my need, as I have
gone along the road that nourished me.</p>

<p>To reach it, I might go by one of two ways: through the grove,
dipping at the end to a patch of seedling pecan trees and a great
bush of trifoliata, the ground thick with blue spiderwort and
wild mustard; a ragged fence is here, marking off what had been a
garden in a dry time, but now, with the lake high, is damp muck
grown rankly in coffee-weed and brambles. I might go persistently
through the coffee-weed and the tearing briers and cross another
ragged fence, and come out on a cattle trail along the lake edge
that crossed into the hammock. Or I might reach it by going to
the south pasture and cutting straight through the hammock edge.
The border is an almost impenetrable tangle of blackberry bushes
and bamboo vines. But by crouching low, a way may be found under
the overhanging thicket, and it is found that this too is a
cattle trail, and a low narrow way leads through perpetual shadow
to the open hammock.</p>

<p>I do not understand how any one can live without some small
place of enchantment to turn to. In the lakeside hammock there is
a constant stirring in the tree-tops, as though on the stillest
days the breathing of the earth is yet audible. The Spanish moss
sways a little always. The heavy forest thins into occasional
great trees, live oaks and palms and pines. In spring, the yellow
jessamine is heavy on the air, in summer the red trumpet vine
shouts from the gray trunks, and in autumn and winter the holly
berries are small bright lamps in the half-light. The squirrels
are unafraid, and here I saw my first fox-squirrel, a huge fellow
made of black shining plush. Here a skunk prowled close to me,
digging industrious small holes for grubs. I sat as still as a
stump, and if he saw me, as I suspect, he was a gentleman and
went on steadily with his business, then loped away with a
graceful rocking motion. A covey of quail passed me often, so
that I came to know their trail into the blackberry thicket where
they gathered in a circle for the night, making small soft cries.
It is impossible to be among the woods animals on their own
ground without a feeling of expanding one's own world, as when
any foreign country is visited.</p>

<p>To the west, the hammock becomes damp, the trees stand more
sparsely. Beyond is a long stretch of marsh where the cattle feed
lazily, belly-deep in water hyacinths and lily pads, then the
wide lake itself. There is a clamor of water birds, long-legged
herons and cranes, visiting sea-gulls from the coasts, wild
ducks, coots, the shrill scream of fish-hawks, with now and then
a bald-headed eagle loitering in the sky, ready to swirl down and
take the fish-hawk's catch from him in midair. Across the lake,
visible the four miles only on a clear day, is the tower of the
old Samson manse, decaying in the middle of the still prosperous
orange grove. From the tower itself, decrepit and dangerous, is a
sight of a tropical world of dreams, made up of glossy trees and
shining water and palm islands. When I am an old woman, so that
too much queerness will seem a natural thing, I mean to build a
tower like it on my own side of the lake, and I shall sit there
on angry days and growl down at any one who disturbs me.</p>

<p>I dig leaf mould from this hammock to enrich my roses and
camellias and gardenias. When I went with my basket one morning a
breath of movement, an unwonted pattern of color, caught my eye
under a tangle of wild grapevines. A wild sow lay nested at the
base of a great magnolia. At a little distance, piled one on the
other, lay her litter, clean and fresh as the sunshine, the
birth-damp still upon them. Sow and litter were exhausted with
the business of birthing. The one lay breathing profoundly,
absorbed in the immensity of rest. The others lay like a mass of
puppies, the lowest-layered tugging himself free to climb again
on top of the pile and warm his tender belly. The mass shifted.
The most adventuresome, a pied morsel of pig with a white band
like a belt around his middle, wobbled over to the sow's side. He
gave a delighted whimper and the whole litter ambled over to
discover the miracle of the hairy breasts.</p>

<p>The jungle hammock breathed. Life went through the moss-hung
forest, the swamp, the cypresses, through the wild sow and her
young, through me, in its continuous chain. We were all one with
the silent pulsing. This was the thing that was important, the
cycle of life, with birth and death merging one into the other in
an imperceptible twilight and an insubstantial dawn. The universe
breathed, and the world inside it breathed the same breath. This
was the cosmic life, with suns and moons to make it lovely. It
was important only to keep close enough to the pulse to feel its
rhythm, to be comforted by its steadiness, to know that Life is
vital, and one's own minute living a torn fragment of the larger
cloth.</p>

<h2><a name="c04">4. <i>The pound party</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We pay no attention to a newcomer at the Creek. There is no
more formal getting-acquainted than among the rabbits in the
woods and the birds in the trees. When any one has been here long
enough, sooner or later his path crosses that of the other
inhabitants and friendship or enmity or mere tolerance sets in. I
was never welcomed to the Creek except by Martha, or my presence
acknowledged. If I stayed, that was my own business, so long as I
minded it. If I did not stay, no one would be surprised and there
was no point in making overtures to me. But how was I to have
known this and that the Townsends' invitation to a pound party
was not a social gesture? I took it at face value.</p>

<p>I knew vaguely that a family lived half a mile away as tenants
in Cow Hammock. A lean brown-eyed man who looked like John the
Baptist often walked down the sand road in front of my house,
scuffling up the dust with long bare feet. A pretty woman with a
baby in her arms sometimes walked with him, or followed him an
hour later, or sometimes appeared mysteriously with him only on
his way back, as though she had gone off to the Creek in the
night and he had come after her by daylight. Actually, I found,
they fished both from Cow Hammock Landing and from Cross Creek,
and one or the other might take the rowboat back and forth.
Apparently countless children loitered along the road, like beads
set far apart in a string, sometimes in little knots, sometimes
singly. They resembled neither St. John nor the woman, but among
themselves were as alike as peas in a pod and precisely the color
of that vegetable when a little wilted. I began speaking to the
children and they answered, not the conventional "Hey!", but
"How-do," politely. Apparently none of them went to school,
although I believe it was that winter that the school bus began
collecting children from the Creek. Once a wagon went by,
lurching in the ruts, filled to overflowing with these
passers-by, integrated at last into one family. They were the
Townsends, and a community to themselves, aloof by choice. There
were enough of them to need no other contacts. One day two of the
small girls appeared at my back door.</p>

<p>The oldest said rapidly, before she should forget the
memorized words, "I'm Ella May, and Mama says we're having a
pound party tomorrow evening and she'd be proud did you
come."</p>

<p>It came to me that this was the first neighborly gesture I had
encountered at the Creek. I was touched.</p>

<p>I said, "I'd be glad to. But what is a pound party?"</p>

<p>"Everybody brings a pound of something. Sugar, or butter, or
candy, or a cake. A cake's fine. Such as that."</p>

<p>The evening of the party was clear as glass and I walked the
half-mile to Cow Hammock. Remembering the swarm of little
Townsends, and adding a houseful of guests in my mind's eye, I
had doubled my largest cake recipe and baked it in a roasting
pan. I thought I must be early, for there was no one in the
shabby house but the Townsends. The children were watching and at
sight of me scattered within.</p>

<p>I heard a sibilant, "Here she comes."</p>

<p>The suspicion had not yet touched me not only that they knew I
should be the sole arrival, but that the party had been built
around the probability of my innocent acceptance. The Townsends
were in their Sunday best, fresh-scrubbed and uncomfortable. The
girls were starched, the boys in stiff clean blue overalls and
shirts. I was given a seat on a bench along a wall. Behind me a
ragged screen over the open window let in a steady stream of
mosquitoes, attracted by the oil lamp on the table. Ella May was
assigned with a newspaper to sit beside me and fan my legs to
keep them from biting me. When Ella May lagged, Beatrice took up
the paper. Their work was enthusiastic but inadequate to the
ingenuity of mosquitoes. I slapped furtively. My cake had the
place of honor on the bare deal table in the center of the room.
A Townsend layer cake dripping sticky icing was pushed modestly
to one side. The rest of the refreshments provided by the hostess
consisted of a bucket of water, a ten-cent jar of peanut butter
and a nickel box of soda crackers.</p>

<p>She said easily, "We'll wait a while to eat, just in
case."</p>

<p>I made conversation as best I could. We talked of the heavy
crop of blackberries, of the Hamon sow that could not be kept up,
no matter how one tried, of the summer rains and of the fishing.
Mr. Townsend spoke up brightly when we reached the fishing.
Fishing was not only the family livelihood but its delight. The
Townsends would have sat all day with poles if they had been
millionaires.</p>

<p>"I'll bring you a mess of bream one day," he said.</p>

<p>The talk ebbed. The mosquitoes buzzed and the Townsends
slapped automatically. The lamp flickered in a gust of wind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsend said, "Be nice, did you blow some, Floyd."</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend echoed, "Blow some, Floyd."</p>

<p>Floyd, the oldest, long, thin and pale, brought out a mouth
organ from his pocket and drew up a straight wooden chair. He
began to pat his foot before he started his tune. Into the
patting came suddenly the whine of the mouth organ. The tune,
formless, unrecognizable, was mournful. One sad phrase repeated
itself over and over. Other Townsends took up the patting and the
rickety floor shook to the thumping. Floyd stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsend said to the air, "Be nice, did Preston
dance."</p>

<p>Preston was five, the youngest weaned Townsend. The older
children seized him and dragged him from the doorway. He hung his
head but made no resistance. They seemed to prop him up, then
retreated and left him standing alone. Floyd took up his tune.
Preston stood staring vacantly. The tune and the party seemed no
concern of his. As though one note had set off a mechanical
spring, he began to shuffle his feet. His body was still. His
arms jerked a little, like a broken jack-in-the-box. His feet
shuffled back and forth without rhythm. He might have been trying
to keep his footing on a slippery treadmill. This was the dance.
I expected him to stop in a moment but he kept it up. The tune,
the dance, were endless.</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsend said complacently, "Preston holds out good,
don't he?"</p>

<p>The compliment seemed a signal, for he stopped as suddenly as
he had begun.</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsend said, "We just as good to eat."</p>

<p>She passed the crackers in one hand and the tiny jar of peanut
butter, with a spoon in it, in the other. Eyes followed her
hungrily. I refused, to the relief of the eyes. I had a dipper of
water and as small a piece of cake as I dared take and yet be
courteous. The two cakes disappeared as though a thunder-shower
had melted them. The party was obviously over. Mrs. Townsend
accompanied me outside the house and to the head of the path. She
looked up into a cloudless and star-lit sky.</p>

<p>"I reckon the threat of bad weather kept the others away," she
said placidly.</p>

<p>I inquired about pound parties at the Creek, and my
gullibility was verified. Yet the occasion had been truly a
party, and the Townsends had done their best to make it festive.
I decided that I should go any time I was invited, and should see
to it that a larger jar of peanut butter was provided. After the
party, the Townsend children and I were great friends. Ella May
and Beatrice came almost every day to visit me. Dorsey and Floyd
and Glenwood came to do odd chores. They were thin, grave boys
and very capable. They moved slowly, like old men, and had the
look of age that hunger puts on children. The boys were the right
size to climb into the pecan trees and shake down and gather the
nuts. The crop was heavy that year, and the filled sacks and
baskets amounted to many hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The boys were asked, "What would you do if you had a dollar
for every one of those pecans?"</p>

<p>There was silence while the thought of wealth was
contemplated.</p>

<p>Dorsey said slowly, "First off, I'd get me a whole plug of
Brown Mule tobaccy, all for myself."</p>

<p>Floyd said, "I'd have all I want of rich folks' rations--light
bread and jelly."</p>

<p>The questioner went on, "What, no cornbread?"</p>

<p>Glenwood said quickly, "Oh yes. We know you got to have
cornbread to grow on."</p>

<p>One week in the next spring the whole family left off its
fishing and picked, without enthusiasm, the heavy crop of beans.
Their pay on Saturday totalled thirty-six dollars. I thought
happily how far this would go. I pictured the big sack of
groceries that night, with money laid by for future needs, seed
and fertilizer perhaps for a garden of their own. On Monday
morning Floyd came to the house.</p>

<p>"Could you let us have two dollars," he asked, "to get us some
rations?"</p>

<p>Their money had surely been stolen from them, or the heavy
hand of poor folks' luck had made them lose it in some
fashion.</p>

<p>"But what happened to the thirty-six dollars you had on
Saturday?"</p>

<p>Floyd's pale face was bright with pleasure.</p>

<p>"We bought us an ottymobile," he said.</p>

<p>They were somehow a challenge. I have never known a more
exquisite courtesy than the whole family possessed. There were
good blood and breeding back of them. I have known no one with
more gracious manners. The children were intelligent. Their
finances were a problem beyond me and would evidently have to
take care of themselves, but it seemed to me that the children's
futures held something better than a precarious living fishing on
Orange Lake. The two great needs, where I could give tangible
help, were their health and their education.</p>

<p>Their green color came from a lifetime of hookworm. I
persuaded the mother and father to let the children be treated.
The tetrachlorethylene capsules were dispensed free by the state.
I obtained capsules and instructions, and set off for the
Townsend house one Saturday night. One by one I handed out the
preliminary doses of Epsom salts. I gave orders about no further
food. On Sunday morning I trudged back again and saw the capsules
safely down the Townsends. I departed with the sense of smugness
common to all meddlers, leaving word that in ten days we would
repeat the treatment. When the ten days were up, the mother
refused point blank to let the children be treated again.</p>

<p>"It made them sick," she said.</p>

<p>"Of course it made them sick. They were eaten up with
hookworm."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"'Twouldn't be safe to give that medicine to them again," she
said firmly. "It must of been stale. You can't trust nothin' is
free."</p>

<p>I was beaten there, and passed on slyly to the matter of
education. Once safely in school, I was sure the visiting county
nurse would have a chance for a fresh battle against the
hookworms. I would give clothes, I said, to all the children who
would go to school. St. John and his wife consulted and it was
agreed that Dorsey and Glenwood, Ella May and Beatrice, might
condescend to be clothed and to allow the school bus from the
village to stop for them.</p>

<p>I am no seamstress, the holding of a threaded needle in my
hand producing an acute stomach ache. But a long line of
Methodist preachers behind me has left the evil thought in the
blood of my brain that the more difficult a job, the more
certainly one must apply oneself to its mastering. I bought yards
of good gingham and sat hour after hour, developing stomach
ulcers, I was certain, at the sewing machine. The girls came for
fittings and had light bread and jelly as reward. I turned out
creditable dresses, nicely trimmed, and went at the job of
underwear. I cut down my own two woolen coats for Ella May and
Beatrice. I bought shirts and pants for the boys. I took my
bundles with a missionary's pride to the Townsends and modest
pleasure was shown in my products. I arranged for the school bus
to stop at the entrance to Cow Hammock. I went home and took a
large dose of bicarbonate of soda.</p>

<p>The next morning one of the smaller children brought me a
dress length of very good silk.</p>

<p>"Mama says will you please make a dress for her."</p>

<p>I took the material to the Townsend house, puzzled, unwilling
as yet to be outraged. Mama was on the lake, fishing. I was shown
some of Mama's other garments. Mama was a much better seamstress
than I--But if the Lord sends forth a strangely agreeable slave
to the sewing machine, surely it is pleasanter and more
profitable to spend one's time on the lovely lake, dangling a
bamboo pole for bream. I left the material and word that my offer
to sew for the Townsends applied only to those in need of
education, not to those who had advanced in philosophy far beyond
me.</p>

<p>The children went to school just long enough to make ownership
of the clothes indisputable. Then they were all home again,
playing in the sandy yard, or as a special treat, taken along on
the fishing parties.</p>

<p>"They didn't like school," St. John informed me gently.</p>

<p>It would be satisfying, if sad, to tell of their tragic
maturities. I can only report that they have grown up as healthy
as any one else, and within the limits of their congenital
leisureliness, are living as active and prosperous lives as their
neighbors. I am sometimes haunted by the feeling that it is I who
could have learned of the Townsends.</p>

<h2><a name="c05">5. <i>The census</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>For learning a new territory and people as quickly as
possible, I recommend taking the census on horseback. In 1930 my
friend Zelma from the village was commissioned to take the census
in the back-country sections of Alachua County. Zelma is an
ageless spinster resembling an angry and efficient canary. She
manages her orange grove and as much of the village and county as
needs management or will submit to it. I cannot decide whether
she should have been a man or a mother. She combines the more
violent characteristics of both and those who ask for or accept
her manifold ministrations think nothing of being cursed loudly
at the very instant of being tenderly fed, clothed, nursed or
guided through their troubles. She was the logical census taker
for our district. She knew all the inhabitants, black and white,
and every road and trail leading to their houses. None of the
places could be reached by a main road, and travelling by
automobile would leave most of the noses uncounted. She borrowed
two horses from the manager of the Maxcey packing house, and on a
bright fall morning we set out together.</p>

<p>I had not ridden since childhood. Even then, my mounts had
been the weary work horses on the Maryland farm, and my brother
and I had been able to ride safely, without saddles, on their
broad backs. I was uneasy at first on my lively mare. Then the
beauty of the country took me over, and I was aware only that
this high vantage point was perfection for the traveller in
strange places. Zelma planned a wide circle for the first day. We
set out to the northwest and came to the hammock lands across the
Creek that bordered Orange Lake. The population was sparse. I
could not understand how folk could settle in the bare
piney-woods, when here were uninhabited hammock acres, rich of
soil, magnificent of vegetation. But the work of clearing hammock
is heavy, and land easily cleared and already open is tempting to
migrants who are often not aware of the differences in fertility.
The sun streamed through the interstices and glinted on the
shining magnolia leaves and sparkleberry bushes. Red-birds darted
down the narrow trail before us and among the palms twined with
trumpet vines, the blossoms the same bright orange-red color as
the birds. Coveys of quail whirred away from us.</p>

<p>"It's a ---- blessing for us not many Yankees have seen
country like this, or they'd move in on us worse than Sherman,"
Zelma said, and reined in her horse to dismount in front of the
first cabin.</p>

<p>We finished the scanty counting along Orange Lake and cut west
toward the River Styx. The name chilled me. My mare was
obstreperous, and as we moved into a wet narrow road, I thought
that all that was needed to make her bolt under me was the sight
of a moccasin. As though I had conjured him up, he was there. We
were approaching a wooden foot-bridge and the mare, who had
balked at all previous bridges, was taking this one of her own
accord. The snake lay on a mound of earth to the right of the
bridge. He was solidly coiled, an ancestral cottonmouth, taking
up as much space as a dishpan. His triangular and venomous head
rested flatly on the outer edge of his coils. The mare failed to
see him because he lay so still. She was intent on her footing,
on the welcome sight of the road ahead. Her careful, dainty
hooves passed three inches from the dark sleek head. I loosened
my feet from the stirrups, ready to jump free. The patriarch eyed
me and did not stir. I decided that such a live-and-let-live
philosophy was admirable, and I touched one finger to my hat,
saluting a gentleman.</p>

<p>We entered the River Styx gently. Surely, death itself must
come as quietly. The open fields, bright in the reality of
sunlight, gave way easily to pine lands. The pines grew thicker,
the sweet scent of their needles rising. The sunlight was spotty,
the shadows of the tall trees wider. Here and there a live oak
told of changing soil. Then, imperceptibly, we were in deep
hammock. Coolness came in on us. The leaves of magnolia and bay
trees shut out the sun, as all dark everlasting foliage must shut
it out from the silent places of the dead. The hammock merged
into cypress swamp. A trumpet vine dropped flamboyant flowers
from a lone palm. The blossoms seemed gaudy and funereal. There
were no birds singing from the cypresses. No squirrels swung in
and out of the sepulchral arches of the trees. Out of the dimly
defined road a great white bird rose, flapping noiseless wings.
It was huge, snow-white as an angel of death, with a wide black
mourning band around the edge of the wings. I became aware that
the soft dampness of the road had turned into a soft rippling.
The whole floor of the forest was carpeted with amber-colored
water, alive, moving with a slow, insidious current. We had
entered the River Styx.</p>

<p>Some English youth, fresh from his Oxford Greek and Latin,
some unhappy, outlawed scapegrace, must have named this silent
stream. Long ago, before the Big Freeze, Florida was a tropic
land of exile. Numbers of younger sons or ne'er-do-wells were
sent here from England, subsidized to stay away. Some were given
funds with which to establish orange groves, funds they often
squandered. One of these, morose, ironic, must have come on this
unknown, unsailed waterway. Bitter, perhaps, certainly homesick,
he was struck by the deathly peace and the dark beauty; stirred
by the pale water hyacinths, diaphanous and unearthly; and it was
truly to him the River of Death, over which, once traversed,
there is no crossing back again. Because this country had become
as dear as life to me, the river held for me no horror. I
wondered if the greater Styx might not be as darkly beautiful.
The leaf-brown overflow of water deepened to the horses' knees.
The white ibis flapped away slowly and came to rest high in a
cypress. Then we were on the rickety bridge over the main body of
the stream, and on the other side, and counting children
again.</p>

<p>I thought, "It is not given to many to cross the Styx and live
to tell it."</p>

<p>We circled back from Orange Lake and across Lochloosa Prairie.
We use the word "prairie" in a special sense. We have no open
plains, but around most of the larger lakes are wet flat areas
thick with water grasses, and these we call our prairies. They
are more nearly marshes, yet we save the word "marsh" for the
deep mucky edges of lake and river, dense with coontail and lily
pads, and for the true salt marshes of the tidal rivers. We found
no living soul across this tract. There were trails used by
half-wild gaunt cattle and dim, deep-rutted roads travelled only
by the lurching turpentine wagons that came with mule and Negro
driver to scrape resin from the clay cups on the tapped
turpentine trees.</p>

<p>We came out at last on a turpentine still and here the
population was black and dense. So many little pickaninnies ran
away from the cabins as the strange horses approached, that it
was a long job gathering them all in to be counted, and their
fancy names and vaguely estimated ages written down on the
papers. Zelma knew all the older Negroes and many of the younger
ones. She joked with some and sympathized with others,
recommended cures for this and that, and promised to send
medicine to one, quilt scraps to another, and a pound of little
conch pea seed to yet another. She chided one lean brown girl for
her immense brood, fathers unknown.</p>

<p>"I know it's too many, Miss Zelma," the girl agreed. "I sho'
got to git me a remedy."</p>

<p>By the time we had finished the Quarters, dusk was falling.
Zelma knew a short cut back to the Creek. It took us by Burnt
Island, and she told me fabulous tales of it in the growing
darkness. There was believed to be the grandfather of all
rattlesnakes living there. Only glimpses had been had of him, but
several reported to have seen his shed skin, and all agreed that
it was nine feet long. The "shed" stretches, and the snake could
reasonably and conceivably have been seven feet in length. There
were wild boars on Burnt Island, savage, long-tusked and
dangerous. The place was also a hideout for criminals who
preferred the great rattler and the wild boars to the arm of the
law. I was not happy when Zelma announced profanely that high
water had covered the old road she meant to take, and we were
lost.</p>

<p>Darkness and our own uncertainty and the long hours away from
the stable made the horses restless. My mare shied at every stick
and reared when a hoot owl cried over our heads from a pine tree.
Then the full moon rose blessedly and roads and woods and prairie
and water were again as plain as by day. We skirted ponds and
continued in a general west by south direction. We came out on
the Creek road, but three miles away from the Creek. We had been
in the saddle from seven in the morning until eleven at night. I
ached through the night and in the morning was obliged to move
with some caution. Yet my own country had been revealed to me and
a twinge of pain was a small price to pay.</p>

<p>The second day we made a wider circle. We found a cabin here
and a shack there, where even Zelma did not know folk were
living, silent people who gave their statistics reluctantly. We
rode down a piney-woods road in the late morning and as the trees
broke at the edge of a clearing, we heard a piano. It was a good
piano, not quite in tune, and it was being played with the touch
of an artist. I thought my senses were playing tricks on me.
Surely I heard only the wind in the pines.</p>

<p>Zelma said, "I forgot that woman was buried back here."</p>

<p>The woman left the piano and came to the door. She was in
immaculate rags and she had once been lovely. The house was
gaping with holes and was stripped bare of all but the most
fundamental pieces of furniture. Several thin clean children came
to stare at us. The woman was starved for talk with her own kind,
and long after the family had been itemized, detained us. Zelma
told me her story as we rode away. She had come some twenty years
before on a tourist's visit to Florida, a young and beautiful
girl of high breeding. Taking in a local square dance as a
spectator she had met a young Cracker and fallen absurdly in love
with him, for the mating instinct knows no classes. She had
married him, and her outraged and prosperous family had left her
to her own devices. Her piano was the only salvage from her early
life. There are hundreds of handsome and sturdy backwoodsmen who
would make good husbands even for such a girl, if her tastes in
living were simple. She had chosen a hopeless and worthless
fellow who sat idly in the sun as her life fell to pieces about
her. The children held her to him. There was something more, too;
a pride that would not admit defeat. I came to know her well, and
I have never known a woman to make a gayer thing of life with
only empty hands to work with. The family was half-starved most
of the time. Yet she made a game of hunger, and a meal of fish
and cornpone was a festival. I went once to visit with her, when
the girls were grown, and found them all strange specters with
their faces smeared with something wet and brown.</p>

<p>The woman said, "We have no place to go and no way of going.
So we think up our own ways of having fun. We're at the beauty
parlor today. We read about beauty masks, so we made a trip to
the edge of the lake and dug mud to make our packs."</p>

<p>Martha has served her without pay when her children were
born.</p>

<p>She said to me, "She shames most women, don't she? I does all
I can for her, 'cause me and the Lord is all she's got to look
out for her, and the Lord ain't exactly put Hisself out."</p>

<p>Martha fixed lunch for Zelma and me that day. We reached her
house in the afternoon and were famished. She made us biscuits
and fried white bacon, and served her best preserves. She had
baked sweet potatoes still hot in the wood range and when we left
she gave us a paper sack of them to carry with us. Our next stop
was at a small Negro cabin and we were thirsty from the salty
bacon. Zelma asked for water and a small black boy handed us up
cool well water in clean gourds. When he reached up to me, he
spilled the cold water on my mare's flank and she bolted like a
rabbit. The woods were full of gopher holes and I dared not try
to rein her in too sharply, for fear she should stumble. I gave
her her head and we tore away madly, and as we went, I scattered
hot baked sweet potatoes all over the piney-woods. The mare and I
were both trembling when she came to a voluntary stop. I was
proud of myself for having stayed on, but all I had from Zelma
was her special brand of profanity for having lost the sweet
potatoes.</p>

<p>I was sorry when the census was over and done with. The region
around me was plainly mapped now in my mind, I knew every one,
black and white, and could never again be a stranger. We allowed
ourselves to be interrupted for one day toward the end. The day
was mild and cloudy. Our friend Fred rounded up Zelma and me to
go fishing with him. The bream were on the bed and the weather
was exactly right. We protested that we should be finishing the
census.</p>

<p>"Now you just as good to come on fishing with me," Fred said.
"You'd ought to know, nobody ain't going to give you their census
on a good fishing day like this."</p>

<h2><a name="c06">6. <i>The evolution of comfort</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When I first came to the Creek, I had for facilities one water
faucet in the kitchen, a tin shower adjoining the Kohler shed and
an outhouse. For the water faucet in the kitchen I was always
grateful, for water pumps at the Creek are all placed in relation
to the well and with little or no concern with distance from the
house. When Martha lived in the Mackay house she had even no
well, but must carry water from the Creek itself. My outside
shower was acceptable enough in summer, though it meant going
damply over the sand to the house afterward. In cold weather--and
you may believe the Chamber of Commerce that we have none, or you
may believe me that on occasion bird-baths have been frozen
solid--in cold weather the outside shower was a fit device for
masochistic monks. The icy spray that attacked the shoulders like
splinters of fine glass was in the nature of a cross. I shall not
forget the early Christmas afternoon, with six men gathered for
dinner, the turkey savory in the oven, the pies cooling, the
vegetables ready, the necessity if not the desire for the bath
borne in on me, and the temperature at thirty-eight and dropping.
I emerged shivering and snarled at the indifferent heavens, "The
first time I get my hands on cash money, so help me, I shall have
a bathroom."</p>

<p>Because of the cold shower, open at the front to a wandering
world, an unfriendly shower, I took to watching for rain like a
tree-toad. For when the soft sluiceways of the skies opened and
the lichened shingle roof shed the waters in a surge down the
northwest sheltered corner of the house, I could strip and accept
the benediction. When the day was hot the rain was cool. When the
day was cool the rain was many degrees warmer, and as bland as
perfumed bath powder. The water faucet and the shower, then,
could be endured. It seemed to me that I had done nothing in all
my life to deserve the outhouse.</p>

<p>It had been years since I had come any closer to one than
James Whitcomb Riley's verses on the subject. But I could look
back on them almost with nostalgia, for those I had known had a
certain coziness and a definite privacy. One of my fondest
recollections is of an outhouse in Virginia. It stood under a
locust, at the top of a little rise of ground. The terrain before
one sloped down past a corner of the flower-bed, bright with
balsam and phlox, to a valley where a cornfield was bordered by a
line of willows. The blue hills of Virginia lifted in the
distance. Three walls of the outhouse were gay with travel
posters from Switzerland, the Rhine and Brittany. It was pleasant
to follow pensively the depicted trails, highways and views. On
the fourth wall hung a sonnet in French, a charming and vulgar
and beautifully composed bit of comment on the circumstances in
which the reader found himself at the moment. All was conducive
to a sense of well-being.</p>

<p>The outhouse on Grandfather's farm was papered with perfectly
beautiful colored pictures of reigning queens. Alexandra was
magnificent. Wilhelmina was demure and very pretty in pale pink
with a pearl and diamond crown. I cannot look today at the news
pictures of the stout housewife in tweeds on a bicycle and
believe that it is the same woman. The queen of Norway I recall
as rather austere, the queen of Italy as blackly horselike. But
all were queens, in full color, in d&eacute;collet&eacute; and
jewelled diadems. The building had a door with crescent windows
and it stood discreetly behind a hickory tree and was reached by
a high trim boardwalk bordered with marigolds.</p>

<p>The outhouse that I inherited at the Creek had no boardwalk,
it had no queens, no marigolds, it had, amazingly, no door. It
stood on a direct line with the dining room windows. One
fortunate diner might sit with his back to it. The others could
not lift their eyes from their plates without meeting the wooden
stare of the unhappy and misplaced edifice. They were fortunate
if they did not meet as well the eye of a belated occupant,
assuring himself stonily that he could not be seen. For there was
indeed a wire screen, and this screen had been, or so the
instigator fatuously pretended, modernized with camouflage.
Streaks of gray paint zigzagged across the screening. The effect
was to make of a human being seated behind it a monster. The
monster had gray bolts of lightning for arms and moss-gray
tree-trunks for legs. Possibly the head of a human tall enough
might have lifted to meet and be shielded by another streak of
gray paint, or one short enough might have been veiled entirely,
but I never peeked in fascination at any occupant of the infernal
box whose face did not gaze recognizably out in a silent and
steely torment.</p>

<p>The camouflage, cruelly, worked perfectly when approached from
the path. The result was that it was impossible to tell, until
too late, whether a living thing was trapped behind it. It seemed
for a time that Uncle Fred had solved this problem. Two days
after his arrival on a visit he asked in a low, strained voice,
"Do you have an old piece of bright flannel I could cut up?" His
manner prohibited questioning. I had been here too short a time
to have acquired scraps of cloth, but I brought out a ragged
quilt, flaming red in color. His face brightened. He went
solemnly away and a little later a two-foot-square red flag stood
in the middle of the path just outside the outhouse. The
technique was obvious and simple. When one went in, one placed
the flag in the path. When one came out, one put the flag back
inside the outhouse. One went in and put the flag in the path.
One returned to the house, forgetting to put the flag back again.
The flag stood like a red light against traffic, for hours and
hours and hours.</p>

<p>These were only the day hazards. Only a pillar of fire by
night would have seemed sufficient comfort and guidance, and this
was never provided except by the dubious assistance of lightning.
There were provided instead, none the less appalling because
harmless, spiders, lizards, toads and thin squeaking noises made
by bats. Over all the dark hours hung the fear of snakes. I had
arrived in Florida with the usual ignorant terror. If time proved
that the sight of a snake was a rarity, there was no help then
for the conviction that the next footstep would fall on a coiled
rattler. An imaginary snake is so much more fearful than a real
one, that I should rather handle a rattlesnake, as I have done
since, than dream of one. I dreaded the sunset, thinking of the
dark box of the outhouse. And once there, even on the blessed
nights of moonlight, the small ominous thuds against floor and
wall that by day were the attractive little green tree-toads, by
night were the advance of nameless reptiles. I would not yield to
the temptation of installing in the house the old-fashioned
"conveniences," for that was an admission of defeat. I would
stick it out and the first cash money should go into a
bathroom.</p>

<p>The first cash money from the first orange crop, a good one,
disappeared into mortgage and note payments, fertilizer and a
Ford, for the seven-passenger Cadillac, a shabby behemoth from
more affluent northern days, had literally torn its heavy heart
out on the deep sand road to the Creek, and was sold for sixty
dollars to a Negro undertaker. He must have towed it with the
hearse, for it was past repairing. There was a year of low citrus
prices and a year of freeze. Then my first Florida story,
<i>Jacob's Ladder,</i> brought in the fantastic sum of seven
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The instant that I saw this wealth begin to dissolve as usual,
I worked rapidly. I would not do anything so reckless as ordering
a complete new bathroom outfit, but would shop around and pick up
something second-hand. The boom was over, and in abandoned houses
in unsold "scrub divisions" bathroom fittings were gathering rust
and discoloration. Inquiry aroused fresh boom hope in various
owners of the unwanted houses and a toilet without a seat
immediately became worth its weight in gold.</p>

<p>My good friend carpenter Moe was at work on the building of
the bathroom. The farmhouse had been built casually in three
separate eras, and while the gap between the front and the back
was now filled in with a porch, there was nothing but space
between the main part of the house and the two large bedrooms
with fireplaces that made up a wing. One stepped into the air
from what, we decided, was not a French door but an Irish door.
That vacuum was providential for a bathroom. It would link the
two bedrooms to the house as cozily as though an architect had
planned it; a careless architect, perhaps, for a difference in
floor levels meant a step down from the first bedroom that has
proved no friend to the aged, the absent-minded and the
inebriated. Moe was pounding away while I lamented that I should
have to go to Sears Roebuck after all. He laid down his hammer
and sat back on his heels.</p>

<p>"Why, I know a feller's got a bathroom outfit," he said.
"Hain't never been used. Brand new, and he's got no more use fer
it than a dog. Feller right over in Citra. You come by for me
this evenin' and we'll go make you a trade. Now I'm plumb proud I
remembered that feller's new bathroom outfit, jest settin'
there."</p>

<p>Moe and I drove to Citra that night. I had the fortunate
feeling that time has taught me to mistrust more than nightmares
and bad omens. We stopped at a shabby house on a side street and
the owner of the bathroom set, presumably so irrelevant to his
life, came to the door.</p>

<p>"I told this lady you had a bathroom set you got no use for,"
Moe said. "Don't say I ain't a friend to you. She'll take it off
your hands and pay cash money for it if the price is right."</p>

<p>A small gloomy man scowled at me and did not answer.</p>

<p>Moe persisted, "Ain't you got a set the Baptist preacher give
you afore he died?"</p>

<p>"Tain't a set. It's just the toilet. It's mine, all right, but
I ain't exactly got it."</p>

<p>''Ain't it handy, where you can git it?"</p>

<p>The little man came to angry life.</p>

<p>He shouted, "It's in the smokehouse to the Baptist parsonage
and I'll git it when I'm o' mind to! They don't want I should
take it but they can't stop me. I've had nothin' but meanness
from the Baptists all my life and I'll go off with that toilet
when I'm ready."</p>

<p>Moe said with deliberate aggravation, "Mebbe you cain't prove
it's yourn."</p>

<p>"I got no call to prove it. Everybody knows how it come to be
mine. The Baptists was too mean to put in runnin' water for
Preacher Wilson, so he give the toilet to me."</p>

<p>"Well, you got no more runnin' water than the Baptists. You
want to sell it?"</p>

<p>The legatee pondered in the dusk.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "No, I don't. I tell you--I thought a heap o'
Preacher Wilson. He give me that toilet--and it's all I got to
remember him by."</p>

<p>Moe comforted me on the way home.</p>

<p>"Like as not it's a no-account thing," he said.</p>

<p>The toilet had to be ordered new after all, but passing over
the catalogue lure of a green-pedestalled monument for washing
one's hands and face, and a Venetian-style recessed tub--for in
spite of the literary windfall, oranges were bringing twenty-five
cents a box--I found a second-hand lavatory and a very good tub
with crooked legs. The formal opening of the bathroom was a gala
social event, with a tray of glasses across the lavatory, ice and
soda in the bathtub, and a bouquet of roses with Uncle Fred's
card in a prominent and appropriate position.</p>

<p>The royalties from my first book, <i>South Moon Under,</i>
went mostly for old debts, but the second, <i>Golden Apples,</i>
brought temporary prosperity again and I decided that nothing is
more tangible for one's money than plumbing. New friends had
found their way to the Creek and were old friends now, and when
there was a week-end houseful, a second bathroom seemed the most
hospitable gesture possible. I contracted again for Moe to add
one beside my own bedroom. The oldest four of his boys were big
enough by this time to give a hand with the carpentering and the
small new room was filled with male Sykeses when we reached the
point of measuring for the height of the shower. Moe was a
realist.</p>

<p>"Git in the tub," he ordered me. "Stand up straight. We'll git
this right the sure way."</p>

<p>I stepped in the tub and stood up straight.</p>

<p>"Now whereabouts you want this here stream o' water to hit
you? 'Bout there?"</p>

<p>Four pairs of bright Sykes eyes helped us gauge the proper
play of water on the bathing form, and I have never felt so
undressed in my life. But the Sykeses rejoiced with me in the
completed bathroom, and although the linoleum buckled for nearly
a year, we all felt that we had achieved unparalleled elegance.
If I give an impression of <i>nouveau riche</i> when I inform
guests pointedly, "The <i>other</i> bathroom is beyond my room,"
I am not bragging, but only grateful. I go happily from one
bathroom to the other, and when a flying squirrel thumps on the
roof at night, the sound is pleasing, for I am safe inside, and I
remember the old Scotch prayer:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"From ghillies and ghosties,<br>
 And long-legged beasties,<br>
 And all things that go <i>boomp</i> in the night,<br>
 Good Lord, deliver us."</p>

<h2><a name="c07">7. <i>Antses in Tim's breakfast</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I have used a factual background for most of my tales, and of
actual people a blend of the true and the imagined. I myself
cannot quite tell where the one ends and the other begins. But I
do remember first a place and then a woman, that stabbed me to
the core, so that I shall never get over the wound of them.</p>

<p>The place was near the village on the Creek road, and I
thought when I saw it that it was a place where children had been
playing. A space under a great spreading live oak had been lived
in. The sand was trodden smooth and there were a decrepit iron
stove and a clothes line, on which a bit of tattered cloth still
hung. There were boxes and a rough table, as though little girls
had been playing house. Only opened tin cans and a rusty pot, I
think, made me inquire about it, for children were not likely to
carry a game so far. I was told that a man and woman, very young,
had lived there for a part of one summer, coming from none knew
where, and going away again with sacks over their shoulders when
the autumn frosts came in.</p>

<p>What manner of man and women could this be, making a home
under an oak tree like some pair of woods animals? Were they
savage outlaws? People who might more profitably be in jail? I
had no way of knowing. The Florida back country was new and
beautiful but of the people I knew nothing. The wild home at the
edge of the woods haunted me. I made pictures to myself of the
man and woman, very young, who had come and gone. Somehow I knew
that they would be not fierce, but gentle. I took up my own life
at the Creek.</p>

<p>The answer to my wonderings was on my own grove and for a long
time I did not know that it was there. A tenant house stood a few
hundred yards from my farmhouse. It was placed beautifully under
a vast magnolia tree and was all gray age and leaning walls. It
was a tall two stories and had perhaps been the original home on
the grove. It was windowless and seemed on the point of
collapsing within itself. The occupants were Tim and his wife and
their baby. I saw only Tim, red-haired and on the defensive and
uninterested in his work. His job with the previous owner of the
grove had been his first of the kind, he said. His weekly wage
was low but I did not question it. He had come with the place.
His passion was for trapping and the hides of raccoons and skunks
and opossums and an occasional otter or wild-cat hung drying on
the walls of his house. He trapped along the lake edge back of
the grove, and I would see him coming in of an early morning with
a dead creature or two in his hands. The well at the barn, in
front of the tenant house, was sulphurous and fit only for the
stock, and Tim came to my pump by my back door for water for his
family uses. I saw his wife only from a distance and made no
inquiries about her.</p>

<p>Callousness, I think, is often ignorance, rather than cruelty,
and it was so in my brief relation with Tim and his wife. My
excuse is that at the time I myself had so much hard physical
work to do and was so confused with the new way of living that I
did not understand that life might be much more difficult for
others. The woman came striding to my back door one day. She had
her baby slung over one hip, like a bundle. She walked with the
tread of an Indian, graceful and direct. She was lean and small.
As she came close I saw that she had tawny skin and soft
honey-colored hair, drawn back smoothly over her ears and knotted
at her neck. She held a card in her hand and she thrust it at
me.</p>

<p>"Please to read hit," she said.</p>

<p>I took the card, addressed to Tim, and turned it over. It was
only an advertisement from a wholesale fur house, quoting current
prices on such pelts as Tim trapped for. I must have seemed very
stupid to her, for I did not know what she wanted. At last I
understood that she could not read, that the card had come in the
morning's rural mail while Tim was at work at the far side of the
grove. Mail, all reading matter, was cryptic and important and it
was necessary to know whether she should call Tim from his work
because of the card. I read it aloud and she listened gravely.
She took it from me and turned to walk away.</p>

<p>"I thank you," she said.</p>

<p>Her voice was like the note of a thrush, very soft and
sweet.</p>

<p>I called after her, seeing her suddenly as a woman, "Tell me,
how are you getting on?"</p>

<p>She looked at me with direct gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothin' extry. They ain't no screens to the house and the
skeeters like to eat us alive. And I cain't keep the antses outen
Tim's breakfast."</p>

<p>Her statement was almost unintelligible. I myself was troubled
by the mosquitoes, for they came up through holes in the kitchen
floor and had my legs swollen to twice their size. But my
bedrooms were tight and comfortable, and when sleep is possible,
one can stand much in the daytime. I had actually not noticed
that the tenant house was wide open to the intrusion not only of
insects, but of wind and weather. The matter of ants in the
breakfast was beyond me. It was only as I came to know the
backwoods cooking customs that I knew that enough food was cooked
once or at the most twice a day, to last for the three meals. The
people were up long before daylight and the remnants of the
previous evening's biscuits and greens and fat bacon were set
aside for the early breakfast, eaten by lamplight. Where a house
was rotting to the ground, ants and roaches inhabited the very
wood of floors and walls and swarmed over the family's edibles.
The situation of Tim's wife puzzled but still did not concern me.
I did not yet understand that in this way of life one is obliged
to share, back and forth, and that as long as I had money for
screens and a new floor, I was morally obligated to put out a
portion of it to give some comfort to those who worked for me. I
took others' discomfort for granted and the only palliation of my
social sin is that I took my own so, too.</p>

<p>I made another profound mistake in my short time with these
two. I asked Tim one day if his wife would do my washing for me.
He looked at me, and looked away angrily and spat.</p>

<p>"A white woman don't ask another white woman to do her washin'
for her, nor to carry her slops," he said. "'Course, in time o'
sickness or trouble or sich as that a woman does ary thing she
can for another and they's no talk o' pay."</p>

<p>There was a fierce pride here, then, and above all, services
that would be gladly given but could not be bought. I began to
understand and then Tim announced that they were leaving.</p>

<p>I asked, "Are you going to another job?"</p>

<p>"No'm. I ain't made for this kind o' work. I don't do it to
suit and it don't suit me."</p>

<p>"Where will you go and what will you do?"</p>

<p>"Same as we done before. I only takened this on account o' the
baby comin'. A woman's got to have a roof over her then. Us'll
git along better thouten no house, pertickler jest a piece of a
house like this un here. In the woods, you kin make a smudge to
keep off the skeeters. Us'll make out."</p>

<p>They moved on, the proud angry man and the small tawny lovely
woman and the baby. But they put a mark on me. The woman came to
me in my dreams and tormented me. As I came to know her kind, in
the scrub, the hammock and the piney-woods, I knew that it was a
woman much like her who had made a home under the live oak. The
only way I could shake free of her was to write of her, and she
was Florry in <i>Jacob's Ladder.</i> She still clung to me and
she was Allie in <i>Golden Apples.</i> Now I know that she will
haunt me as long as I live, and all the writing in the world will
not put away the memory of her face and the sound of her
voice.</p>

<h2><a name="c08">8. <i>The Widow Slater</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Widow Slater and I understood each other from the
beginning. She was a violent person and I was warned to beware of
her eccentric and unpredictable indignations. I found that
nothing about her was unpredictable, for all her being was keyed
to the one idea, that whatever is, is good. At the time when I
was warned against her, she had just made a local reputation by
lifting a shotgun in defiance against the starched white bosom of
a county nurse. The occasion was simple and her violence was no
contradiction in her character. The order had gone forth from
health authorities that all school children were to be inoculated
against smallpox or typhoid or something or other. The Widow
Slater had refused to have done anything so unnatural and
savoring of witchcraft as injecting the blood of a horse in the
veins of her offspring.</p>

<p>Her feeling was, simply, that God knows best. What she meant
by "God" I do not know, and no two people mean the same thing in
their invocation of the mystic Word. My own idea is that those of
us who are least positive are closest to the truth. We know only
that as human beings we are very stupid and that somewhere beyond
us are forces unintelligibly wiser or cleverer or more fixed than
we. The forces may concern themselves with us or they may not,
but it seems to me, and seemed to the Widow Slater, that people
live or die, thrive or pine, quite beyond human reason. In the
matter of the inoculation and in several kindred matters I
believe that the belligerent mother was wrong. I am only
applauding her philosophy.</p>

<p>Her firm conviction that God moves in a mysterious way, His
wonders to perform, applied to the delights of life as well as to
its burdens and its sorrows. In this, she differed from most
"professing" Christians, who see God in everything difficult and
unpleasant, but seldom in the natural joys. I have never known a
person who had less over which to rejoice, who found more in
daily living to rejoice her. She was herself almost constantly
ill, local doctors being certain that she had a tumor that
required removal. This she rejected, saying, "I come into the
world in one piece and I aim to go out the same way. I'll not
have a part of me buried here and the rest yon." Yet for all the
reverence for the short, stout, untidy body which had been given
her, she never spared it. People with a philosophy are usually
inconsistent.</p>

<p>She had been a widow for some years and her family was large
for one of no means at all. There was a daughter, distant in
Alabama. There was Snow, a grave, brown-eyed youth, sullen when I
first knew him under the family difficulties. There was Henry, a
cripple, with the same indomitable spirit as his mother, who took
a course in watch repairing and set up in a hole in the wall in
Gainesville and became a personage. There were Alvah and Little
Irene. And there was the youngest, Rodney, whose club feet and
twisted legs and tortured back made Henry seem an athlete in
comparison. Somewhere in the family blood was a strain that
should not, eugenically, have been perpetuated. Yet all of the
Widow Slater's brood, the "chappies" as she called them, Carolina
fashion, had a luminous quality that somehow set them beyond the
well and fit and made of them more desirable citizens and friends
and neighbors than many a well-cared-for aristocrat.</p>

<p>She was an artist in optimism. Her rented house leaked so
badly that beds must be moved and all available pots and pans set
under the worst holes whenever the rain fell.</p>

<p>She only said, "You know there's plenty of places in the roof
I could get through, and a heap more Irene could," and chuckled
at her own description.</p>

<p>In her place I should either have kicked down the walls of the
house, or lain down and given up, putting the full responsibility
for my care on that Providence that she was so sure watched over
the sparrow's fall.</p>

<p>She asked me for work, in an early year at the Creek when I
had little to spend for help of any sort. All I could offer was
the washing. It was too heavy even for me, though I did it when
necessary, and I told her so and did not see how she might manage
it. But she insisted and took the unreasonable labor as a favor.
She asked to do it of a Saturday morning, when Alvah and Little
Irene were home from school to help, and begged of me only that I
not hurry her at it. The washing was a long and incredibly sloppy
procedure. The Widow Slater dressed always in a Victorian white
shirtwaist and a long full-flowing black skirt. She trailed her
long black skirts through the puddles of soapsuds splashed around
her and carried great dripping armfuls of half-wrung sheets to
the clothes line, and was concerned, not with the hardships, but
with the weather and the phlox. The weather almost always suited
her, for if it was fine the clothes would dry well and if it
rained, why, nothing was better for bleaching them. The phlox
bothered her for the reason that they grew wild in the yard
around the wash-bench and she was afraid of stepping on them.</p>

<p>"They look up at you with little faces," she said, "and it
seems treacherous to stomp them."</p>

<p>She reported happily one day that Snow was doing better at his
fishing.</p>

<p>"Folkses has woke up a catfish market," she said.</p>

<p>The closest to complaint I ever heard her come was when she
would say, as though it were a great joke, "I feel as if I'd been
drug between two twisted Fridays."</p>

<p>She made high-spirited play even of our fence-repairing. The
fences around Old Boss' orange grove and mine were old and
rotten. Her cow Betsy and my Laura, pastured jointly in my
sixteen-acre field, were wise in forbidden ways. They went
through the old fence as if it were not there, until we learned
to fool them. We did this by dragging boughs and brush to the
weakest places and propping them up with a plausible look of
impenetrability. We had done this through a steaming hot summer
afternoon, through the poison ivy, until we had exhausted our
supply of camouflage. We stood scratched and perspiring and very
dubious.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I reckon it may look solid to a cow, but
it's a mighty hypocritical kind of a fence."</p>

<p>The word "hypocrite" may have been a favorite in the family.
Little Irene came out with it one day. She brought us a katydid
to show, cupped carefully in her small grubby hands.</p>

<p>"I caught me a hypocrite," she said.</p>

<p>The widow chuckled.</p>

<p>"That's a jizzywitch, honey," she corrected her.</p>

<p>Irene stamped her bare foot.</p>

<p>"'Tis not. It's a hypocrite. I know, because all hypocrites is
long-legged."</p>

<p>The Widow Slater, as I look back on it, did much more for me
than I did for her. She trudged from our joint pasture night and
morning with my bucket of milk. She gave me settings of eggs.</p>

<p>"Now if your hen," she said, "proves up anyways false to you,
I have one setting I'll lend to you."</p>

<p>Most helpful of all, after we were well acquainted, she loaned
me Alvah afternoons after school to wash dishes. Alvah saved part
of her small pay to buy me a Christmas present. The present was a
set of glass wind chimes, and until the day when a strong wind
blew them to the floor in splinters, the high thin tinkling
sounded to me like the laughter of the child herself. There was
something fey about most of the family. Rodney, the cripple,
foretold the weather with a strange accuracy. He had always some
small pet, a squirrel or chameleon or perhaps a chicken hurt and
crippled like himself. I think that "Fodder-wing" in <i>The
Yearling</i> must have been Rodney.</p>

<p>The widow's confidence in me faltered only once. Several
eminently respectable souls in the town of Ocala had offered me
their friendship, among them the venerable white-haired mayor. It
was time to return their hospitality and I invited them for
supper. I asked Alvah to come and help me with the serving. She
agreed with enthusiasm. The next day she did not meet my eyes.
She said in a low voice that Mama would have to think about the
question of her helping with the party. I assured her that the
work would be light and I would take her home myself. The day of
the supper the Widow Slater came unhappily, twisting her
apron.</p>

<p>"You been mighty good to Alvah," she faltered. "I'm just
obliged to let you have her." She laid a trembling hand on my
arm. "Alvah's young," she quavered, "and I look to you to protect
her."</p>

<p>I did not know the decorous gathering well enough to tell them
that they came to Cross Creek as a menace to a young girl's
virtue.</p>

<p>The widow and Alvah and Irene and I all wept when they moved
away to Carolina. Some small stout cord bound us together. Alvah
came back to visit Snow a year or so ago and came to see me. She
was a tall shy young woman, and it was plain that, thanks no
doubt to her mother's standards, much firmer than our fence, her
virtue was still not only intact, but, I fear, inviolable.</p>

<p>I think that Snow, the widow's eldest, was her greatest
concern. She grieved over him when she left him behind at the
Creek. He had already left her leaking roof to shift for himself.
She knew that he was fishing for a living but could not find out
how or where he might be. From Carolina, she could get no word
from him in answer to her letters, and wrote me, beseeching news.
I had none to give her, but reported that I saw him pass now and
again and he looked well. I could find out no more than she of
his mode of life. Her occasional anxious letters kept the youth
on my mind. I knew that at one time he had done satisfactory
grove work for Old Boss and when I became desperate for male
help, I decided to run him down. Tom Glisson told me where I
should find him.</p>

<p>"I'm proud his Ma don't know how he's livin'," Tom said. "If
she was here, she'd anyways keep him off the dirt."</p>

<p>I did not understand him until I drove down the dim hammock
road to the lake edge where Tom told me I should find him. I
could not believe that I had come to the right place until a dog
I knew for Slater property came from the woods with wagging tail.
The camp was a palmetto shack, no larger than six feet by eight.
The four corners were sapling cypresses. Palmetto fronds joined
these to make walls and were thatched overhead for a roof.
Cockroaches ran among the fronds and darted inside the dark box
of a home. There was a half-door, the lower half made from a
crate and the upper of burlap sacking. I lifted the sacking and
saw that he had built a sapling bunk along one side. The pallet
on it was filled with moss. A ragged quilt was the only cover. A
small rusty stove stood opposite the bunk, its pipe lifting
crookedly and precariously above the dry palmetto thatching. I
have seen only one other human habitation more primitive and
desolate than this. A can of beans had made his last meal. I was
glad the widow, grieving for his silent ways, could not see or
know.</p>

<p>I left a note pinned on the sacking. The next day he came to
work, his face pinched from privation, his overalls shabby. He
walked the two miles back and forth each day, and while the wages
I could pay shamed me to offer, they were standard in the
section. His lean grave young face filled out, and his
loose-limbed frame, and decent shirt and cap and breeches
replaced the soiled raggedness. He was a fine grove man and we
began a relationship somehow beyond that of employer and
employee. A bond was forged that will last as long as either of
us lives. Yet he was plainly unhappy. He was close-mouthed, and
while he expressed anxiety over the grove and my own returns from
it under his care, he did not discuss his own difficulties. At
long last the truth came out. He was one of those who pined for
his own piece of land, and he should never be content until he
tilled his own acres, had his own house, and a wife to bring him
the cheeriness the widow had brought to her brood. His wages only
fed and clothed him. He could not save for his dream in a whole
life's span.</p>

<p>When my own fortunes took a turn for the better, my first act
was to raise his pay. As time went on, I raised it again, until
he was getting twice the rate of other grove workers. This was
low enough, by decent standards, yet out of it he could save
regularly. We both admired the rich hammock land near his
palmetto shack, and one day he came to report that thirty-five
acres of the best could be bought for taxes. I sent him to the
tax sale and he came back with the tax certificate to the
land.</p>

<p>I said, "That land is for you, Snow," and wondered why I had
not had the intelligence earlier to go hungry, if necessary, to
get it for him. He was one who needed only the slightest edge on
life to master it.</p>

<p>We planned his house together, poring, when his work was done,
over the mail order catalogue for doors and windows and roofing.
He built the house himself in his off hours and on Sundays, and
it is a good house. It has old orange trees around it, and a
magnolia tree by the gate, and the hammock soil around it as rich
as any man needs for making his living. I hope that some day his
mother will come and see it. She would say, "Of course he's
gettin' along good. A person allus gets out of life what he's
entitled to. The Lord sees to that."</p>

<p>One week-end Snow asked to borrow the grove truck.</p>

<p>"I got something I want to fetch from Gainesville," he
said.</p>

<p>I said, "Of course. And since you're going, you can bring out
the fertilizer I have on order there."</p>

<p>His expression was suddenly strange.</p>

<p>"Sure," he said.</p>

<p>On Monday morning he did not appear. Martha came to the
door.</p>

<p>"I got a message for you from Snow," she said. "He couldn't
carry the fertilizer Saturday and he's gone to get it this
mornin'. He said tell you he was goin' on his own time and payin'
for the gas."</p>

<p>"But why couldn't he bring it Saturday?"</p>

<p>"Sugar," she said, "a man bringin' a bed and a bride just
ain't got the room nor the notion for a ton o' fertilizer."</p>

<h2><a name="c09">9. <i>Catching one young</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I bought Georgia of her father for five dollars. The surest
way to keep a maid at the Creek, my new friends told me, was to
take over a very young Negro girl and train her in my ways. She
should be preferably without home ties so that she should become
attached to me. My friends traced a newly widowered father of a
large family that he was unable to feed as a unit. He was happy
to "give" me Georgia, with no strings attached. A
five-dollar-bill sealed the bargain. Two months of life with her
made me wonder why he had not given her to the first passing
gypsy caravan, or drowned her decently.</p>

<p>It is possible that in catching one young, I had picked from
too early a litter. No one knew her exact age, but it was
somewhere between ten and twelve. At any rate, Georgia was
unteachable. I could remember having polished silver, made beds,
dried dishes and dusted furniture on educational Saturday
mornings at that age, so I knew the thing was possible. It was
pure theory as far as Georgia was concerned. She was happy, in
fact too happy for a brown child whose lifelong lot it would
presumably be to earn her bread by the sweat of her brow. Georgia
never moved fast enough to sweat. She had a passion for
butterflies and I could never understand how she could put out
her hand with enough speed to catch one. I decided that she just
sat in the sun watching the butterflies, and sooner or later by
the law of averages one lit on her hand and her fingers closed
over it so slowly that it was not alarmed. At the moments when
she caught the butterflies, the unwashed breakfast dishes were
usually sitting as inert as she.</p>

<p>Great effort, after a month, produced the impression on her
that not only were dishes meant to be filled with food and the
food eaten therefrom, but that after this pleasant process the
dishes must be cleansed and so made ready for the next serving.
The chain of thought was difficult for her but at last I felt she
understood. Progress was being made in teaching her "my ways."
Guests came to luncheon and we adjourned afterward to the fire in
the living room. I sat comfortably. When the guests left three
hours later I went out to the kitchen. The luncheon dishes still
sat on the dining table. The kitchen was in the supreme disorder
that I achieve when I cook. Georgia sat in the sun on the back
steps, playing with a butterfly.</p>

<p>"But you haven't touched the dishes," I said.</p>

<p>"You never told me," she answered.</p>

<p>As I remember, this ended all hope. The ha'nts had something
to do with it. It was peculiarly upsetting to be awakened in the
night by a figure in the doorway of my bedroom, saying, "The
ha'nts has done come." When I insisted that there was no way for
ghosts to get in, she informed me, "They comes in thu the
cracks." This was unanswerable and so was Georgia. I made up my
mind that I would teach her something. Her listless manner lent
itself to the lesson. I taught her to announce a meal. I taught
her to go to the veranda or the living room and say with her
detached air, "Such as it is, it's ready."</p>

<p>And then I gave her father five dollars to take her back
again.</p>

<p>Two or three years ago Martha said, "We had somebody you know
come see us today. Georgia. She married and got three chillens.
She said she used to work for you."</p>

<p>I could only say, "She said she used to do <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>Georgia should have taught me the futility of taking a child
and expecting results any sooner than seven or eight years. The
theory came from the old plantation South, where already-trained
and mature servants carried on while the younger generation was
learning its trade. But I tried again. Finances had something to
do with it, for at the time I could not afford the wages of a
grown woman. I made no down payment on Patsy, but agreed with her
grandmother, with whom she lived, to train her, clothe her, care
for her, and to pay two dollars a week--to the grandmother.
Patsy's mother was "off." This had no connotation of mental
aberration. It meant only that she had wandered off with her
latest lover and was not in direct communication with her
family.</p>

<p>It was probably my fault that I never made much of a success
with Patsy. The truth of it was, we had too good a time together.
She was as charmed as I with the novelties of flora and fauna and
we learned together. When I should have been teaching her to make
biscuits and scour skillets, we were wandering in the wildest
part of the hammock by the edge of the lake. There we discovered
strange flowers and ferns, and a prize of a large planting of the
finest yams, left behind unharvested by the previous grove owner.
The yams were deep gold and of a size and sweetness and
mellowness I have never tasted since. We found turtles laying,
and dug their eggs to boil and eat, and Patsy discovered a new
world of foods. She began to study everything with an eye to its
edibility. A red bird sang from the pecan tree by the kitchen
door.</p>

<p>"Is that ol' reddy-bird good to eat?" she asked me.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I shouldn't eat him anyway, because he
sings so sweetly."</p>

<p>She inquired if I meant to put a certain hen in the pot.</p>

<p>"Why, no. That hen is a good layer. I wouldn't want to eat
her."</p>

<p>"Ha!" she said. "If I was that ol' hen, I'd fix to go right on
layin'. And if I was that ol' reddy-bird, I'd fix to go right on
singin'."</p>

<p>Having Patsy was strangely like having a child of my own; a
black one, as though she were a changeling. She must have felt
the same way. We walked one day up Old Boss' path on an errand. I
was ahead, walking with a hurried gait that I am told is very
awkward. My friend Dessie says of it that when I am in a hurry
the head is thrust forward, the upper body lying on the wind,
reaching for a speed that is quite beyond the legs and feet,
carried hopelessly behind. The effect, she says, is that of a
wild turkey hen making a getaway. Patsy was a yard or so behind
me.</p>

<p>I heard her say, with a curious mixture of pride and
affection, "Step it off, Mama! Step it off!"</p>

<p>I am never done with marvelling at the sensitivity to beauty
of presumably the dullest and most ignorant souls. The black
child Patsy had this response. We went together into the yard one
night when the only light was from the stars. She stood
motionless by the Oneika mandarin tree. She gave the little
chuckle peculiar to her when ideas raced in her small kinky
head.</p>

<p>"You can't see the tangerines," she said, "in the dark. But
you know they're there, and you think you see 'em. And they look
purtier than in the daytime. It's the same with the stars. You
see 'em when the sky's plumb black, and that's when they shine
the best."</p>

<p>The Negro imagination is dark and rich. As they grow older,
they learn to save it for their own kind, to hide it from
unfriendly minds, perhaps, in an alien civilization. But a Negro
child will some day make a sad and lovely study for a poet. There
was a small grandson of old Martha who came now and then to
visit. He found a rare snail in the orange grove and brought it
to me to say, "I fetched you this, Missy, for a play-pretty." He
brought me once, too, a toad, cupped in careful black paws.</p>

<p>"Look at the little ol' hoppy-toad," he said. "He's got big
eyes jus' like our baby."</p>

<p>I do not know whether Patsy would have stayed with me or not,
if she had been left to herself. She was snatched away by her
mother, who appeared, fat and slovenly and predatory, to claim
her. My friends had not foreseen the fact that once a girl was
old enough to be of real use, she had more value in a lazy home
household than any wages she might turn in. Patsy went away, with
a good rudimentary knowledge of housekeeping and cooking, to a
turpentine camp where her mother lived with the latest paramour.
The Creek always has few Negroes, and Patsy's cousin told me that
Patsy, at not quite twelve, was "courting." She seemed to me no
more restless than any kitten, but it may be that she saw bright
boys' eyes in the darkness where there were none, and that like
the mandarin oranges and the stars, they were the more glamorous
for being invisible.</p>

<h2><a name="c10">10. <i>'Geechee</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The black girl came on foot the four miles from the village.
She was barefooted. She strode up the path to the back door,
thick-legged, her big toes splayed in the sand. She stopped short
and glared at me, as though she meant to strike me. She wore one
garment, too short for her erect height. It was of muslin flour
sacking, so tattered that the full length of one sweating thigh
showed through its multiple rents. She was the dusty black of
teakwood. Two short tufts of hair were braided over her temples.
They were stiff, a trifle curved, like horns.</p>

<p>She said fiercely, "I hear tell you want a girl. You take me."
She seemed impossible. She looked capable of murder. It would be
like having a black leopard loose in the house.</p>

<p>I said, "I wanted a young girl."</p>

<p>"I be's young."</p>

<p>"No. One young enough to teach my ways."</p>

<p>"If I don't do to suit you, you can cut my throat."</p>

<p>It occurred to me that displeasure might work two ways. It
seemed necessary to placate her rather than, simply, to reject
her.</p>

<p>I said, "A girl your age wouldn't be satisfied four miles from
town."</p>

<p>She stepped closer as in menace.</p>

<p>"Town ain't nothin' to me. You don't know. I don't do no
courtin'. I don't want no man around me. You jes' don't
know."</p>

<p>I said helplessly, "I'm sure you wouldn't suit me."</p>

<p>"Time to say, time you've done tried me. All you got to do is
try me."</p>

<p>Futility possessed me.</p>

<p>I said, "I can't pay very high wages."</p>

<p>"Any wages is better than nothin'. I got to get work. I got a
use for my pay."</p>

<p>It was her eyes, I decided, that were frightening me. One was
blind and white, fixing me with an opaque, unseeing purpose. I
made a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"Right now, this porch floor ain't scrubbed," she said. "You
got to have things clean. I be here soon in the mornin'. I got to
fotch my things."</p>

<p>She turned on her bare heels to go.</p>

<p>I called after her, "But I don't know anything about you.
What's your name? Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Name be's Beatrice. I be's 'Geechee. Folks jes' calls me
'Geechee."</p>

<p>She was gone, striding down the path toward some black and
Amazonian army that awaited her coming that the battle might
begin. I felt dazed and foolish, as though I had been hypnotized
by a grotesque idol. She was the ugliest Negress I had ever
seen.</p>

<p>The Ogeechee River is tidal and its salt tongue licks far into
Georgia. The Negroes of the region, cotton niggers, sugar
niggers, rice or tobacco niggers, the sons and daughters of
slaves, are of a special African tribe and have kept their
identity. They are very black; strong, with a long stride; their
bodies straight as palm trunks; violent, often, and as violently
loyal. Another black will say, "He's 'Geechee. I'se skeert of
him," and a Georgia plantation owner will say, "There's no better
Negro in the world if you get a good one."</p>

<p>'Geechee came the next day at daylight and had good strong
coffee and crisp small biscuits ready when I awakened. Her
"things" were a comb, not the straightening comb of
sophistication, but the ordinary kind, toothless from struggles
with her knotted wool--and a bundle of letters. That was
literally all. I had never seen material possessions at a more
irreducible minimum. Even the letters, I thought, were a fancy
and could have been dispensed with. I did not know my 'Geechee.
She had nothing to wear but the torn shift in which she had
appeared, challenging me to accept her. I dressed her. She was
bigger-boned than I, but leaner. In my clothes she looked like a
battered black rag doll. As the weeks passed I bought her a
cautious cheap uniform or two. Even in their white formality she
seemed always about to burst into a belligerent dance, tearing
her garments from her, prancing naked in a savage triumph. The
effect came from her lioness stride, from her unkempt hair which
shot in black electric spirals from her skull, and from the white
eye with its hypnotic probing. She had been blind in it, she
said, since the big fight.</p>

<p>"I dis-remember did I get the lick before they put me in the
jailhouse or en-durin' the time they was puttin' me in the
jail-house."</p>

<p>I could have beaten her raw those first months and it would
not have mattered. She cleaned my house. She began with the
painted wooden ceilings, the hand-hewn rafters where generations
of dirt-daubers had built their mud homes. She continued down the
painted walls, where roaches had trailed and long-vanished
children had drawn pictures. She included the furniture in her
sweep, so that polished mahogany emerged pale and unshining. She
washed rugs that would go in the wash-pot. Those that would not,
she beat until they hung limp and dustless over the clothesline.
She thrashed mattresses in the sunlight. Their tufting covered
the yard like full-blown thistles. She ended with the floors. She
used six cans of potash, and where there had been soot and grease
and streaked varnish and the ochre-colored paint dear to all the
South, there were now soft pine boards, luminous with age. There
was a hole in the middle of the kitchen where she had followed a
stain quite through the flooring.</p>

<p>I shall never have a greater devotion than I had from this
woman. She was, as I had thought, not young. Within a week, all
fear of her was gone and in its place came the warmth of being
watched over and served and cared for. Then she began to drop
unintelligible hints. There was something back of the service,
something back of the fierce woman. I remembered my first sensing
of a fixed purpose.</p>

<p>She said, "I'm doin' to suit you?" and I said, "Yes," and she
said, "You trust me, enty?" and I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>One day when she had been with me for some months, making life
a good smooth thing, she said, "I got a thing to tell you. I got
to have help."</p>

<p>It seemed to me then that I had always known that we were
building up to this; that it was not she who was serving me, but
I who was destined to serve her.</p>

<p>I said, "What is it?"</p>

<p>She brought a mass of crumpled paper from her breast.</p>

<p>"These is from my man," she said. "Read them."</p>

<p>"My sweet Beatrice," they read, "you got to get me out. I
can't stand it. You got to get me out."</p>

<p>One after another, they sang the same refrain. They were
written from the state prison.</p>

<p>"You know people," she said. "You can git him out. I got to
git him out. You can do it."</p>

<p>I felt like a pawn in the hands of dark forces. Her man was
named Leroy. He was serving a twenty-year sentence for
manslaughter.</p>

<p>"He didn't do a thing," she said. "This other nigger was
layin' for him. He went at Leroy and he bopped him one and Leroy
be's strong and he made a pass at him and it done killed this
nigger. And you got to git him out."</p>

<p>The 'Geechee had become a part of me. I had little of comfort
and that little stemmed from her.</p>

<p>I said, "I'll do what I can," and did not mean to. I needed
her more than did Leroy.</p>

<p>I wrote a bland letter to the superintendent of the prison. It
was answered as blandly, for I think he understood me. Time
passed. Then one day I got the mail from the rural mail-box
instead of sending 'Geechee for it, and in the mail was a letter
addressed to her from a lawyer. I questioned her.</p>

<p>She said, "You ain't done nothin' for Leroy, when you could. A
lawyer that visits at the prison done tol' him he could git him
out for two hundred dollars. I wrote him I'd git it, did he give
me time."</p>

<p>No shyster lawyer could liberate a killer. I could not endure
to have her slave and save and throw away her money on one such.
And surely, if this fierce good woman believed in Leroy, he must
be entitled to consideration. I felt an unreasonable trust in her
judgment and her loyalty.</p>

<p>I said, "Don't pay this lawyer another dollar. I'll see what
we can do."</p>

<p>I drove to Raiford and interviewed the superintendent. Leroy
had been a model prisoner. The superintendent was an
idealist.</p>

<p>"If you can give Leroy a job," he said, "I see no reason why
he shouldn't return to normal living. Lack of work when a man
first gets out is the usual stumbling-block."</p>

<p>I had made good friends; a state senator, the president of a
university. I asked them to wire the Pardon Board, asking for the
black man's parole to me. I had a hearing at the state capitol
and Leroy was paroled in my care. I drove back to the grove to
gather up 'Geechee to go to the prison to collect the man for
whom she had starved and toiled and gone ragged.</p>

<p>Leroy was not at the prison when we reached there. He had
headed on his release, an hour before, not for the black woman
who had done so much for him, but direct to Jacksonville for a
round of carousing. He showed up at the grove four days later. He
was a slim, sullen, light-brown man with shifty eyes. 'Geechee
walked on air. I would pay him, I told him, the customary rural
wages, his house and fuel free, and he might have the use of the
farm truck once or twice a week. The grove work was not too hard
and I would show him all that must be done. I had bought clothes
for him, and I gave them a real wedding, with good food
afterward.</p>

<p>For a week he languished comfortably under his wife's care. He
made no effort to learn the grove work but I did not hurry him.
Four years in jail would surely do something to a man's
initiative. He could not plunge at once into living. There must
be a period of adjustment, as for one who long blind should come
with new sight into the sunlight. I made my excuses for him and
'Geechee lost her air of ecstasy. She worked harder than ever,
for now she had Leroy's comfort to look after. My own work was
never slighted.</p>

<p>At the end of the second week he came to the back door for his
Saturday wages. I hold no brief for southern wages, yet many
Negroes supported in a rudimentary comfort large families on
Leroy's pay, and must pay rent and buy fuel to boot, without the
extra wages that 'Geechee brought in. Instead of standing at the
door to receive his money, the man pulled it open and brushed
past me and seated himself insolently on the bench. He crossed
his legs and threw back his head, narrowing his eyes at me. In a
loud voice he began to recite his grievances. He could not live
on his pay. He wanted better clothes than those I had bought him.
Nobody could be expected to live out here in the woods. It was
too far from town. A man had to have his own automobile. He
stopped shouting and began to mutter. There was more than a hint
of threat in the low growling voice. I who had freed him was an
object of hate. My friend Dessie was in the house. She was so
certain that the man was about to spring at me that she slipped
to her car for her revolver.</p>

<p>He said, "I jus' as soon be in jail as out here in the
woods."</p>

<p>I saw 'Geechee slip into the kitchen with tears raining down
her black cheeks. I was sick at heart. I ordered him back to the
tenant house. I locked my house, which stands for weeks in my
absence without even the latching of a screen, and drove to town
to put in a long distance call to the prison superintendent.
There was a silence at the end of the wire.</p>

<p>At last, "The prison is crammed full. We have absolutely no
room for him. Send him away at once. You are running a great
personal risk. If he can keep out of serious trouble, we'll let
him go his way. If he gets into trouble, he'll automatically be
picked up again." He sighed. "If I live long enough, I'll learn
to recognize the true criminal nature. This man has it."</p>

<p>It was dusk when I reached the grove. 'Geechee, I knew, with
her fierce loyalty, would go with him. I could not send her off
in the night. I slept uneasily that night, my revolver under my
pillow. In the morning she brought my coffee. Her face was drawn
and inscrutable.</p>

<p>I said, "Leroy must leave as soon as you've had breakfast. I
know you'll want to go with him. I shall be very sorry to be
without you. I've become attached to you, 'Geechee."</p>

<p>She said, "I ain't goin' with him. I don't mind him doin' me
wrong. He ain't never done anything but wrong to me. But nobody
ain't never done for him what you done. He ain't worth killin',
the way he talked to you. I wanted to die, listenin' to him."</p>

<p>The world seemed suddenly a brighter place. Then I knew that
no new treachery would alter her long loyalty to the man she had
known always was worthless.</p>

<p>I said, "It will be better for you to go with him. Then if you
still prefer to be with me, you can come back. I'll wait a week
or two to get another girl."</p>

<p>She said, "You cain't git along without me. I'se seed. You
needs me. I'll go with him. I'll make sure he goes off far
enough. I be back Tuesday mornin' on the nine o'clock train."</p>

<p>Sunday and Monday were long. I could not concentrate on my
work. I did the household chores absently. I milked the cow and
fed the chickens. The grove seemed very silent with no human
being about, no man to care for it, no kind black hands serving
me in the house. I was so sure that 'Geechee's loyalty to her man
would not waver that I very nearly did not go to the village on
Tuesday. I made an excuse to myself to go to the village store at
train time. The local puffed to a stop at the dingy station and
'Geechee was there. We lonely humans need very little of devotion
for contentment. For the moment, this black one-eyed savage woman
was all I needed. I touched her calloused dark hand.</p>

<p>She said, "Us'll make out all right. Us'll do better
alone."</p>

<p>We drove home to the grove and Mandy the pointer dog leaped up
to lick her face in welcome. She celebrated by putting on one of
the uniforms in which she was patently uncomfortable and set
about putting the house in proper order. The day was fine and
sunny, and she drove the cow in at evening and we managed the
milking together. After supper she went alone to the tenant house
of which she had hoped to make a home. We got along very well on
our own. She was sad and quiet. Leroy was living in Jacksonville
with another woman and quarrelling with all around him. She had
done her best and now a thing was ended and a book was closed. I
urged her to let me drop her off in Citra where the Negroes are
gay and light-hearted of a Saturday night. I told her to invite
them out to her house.</p>

<p>"Surely you can get a new beau," I said.</p>

<p>She said gravely, "You'd ought to know, jus' anybody won't
do."</p>

<p>She was as wild-looking as some fresh-caught African slave,
but she had given her big heart for life.</p>

<p>It made her happy for me to have parties. She seemed to think
that I needed the gayety I urged on her. When the house was full
for a buffet supper, she put on her best apron and tied a
handkerchief over her tufted head and dashed in and out among the
guests, crying the flavor of our foods. When it was time to pass
the dessert, she raced through the house with a loaded tray,
shouting at the top of her voice, "Sherbet comin' up! Sherbet
comin' up!" Her delight was infectious, and friends complain
mournfully, now she is gone, that they never had better times at
the Creek than when 'Geechee rushed among them, pressing them to
drink deep and eat hearty. Once my friend Norton slipped away to
my room to steal a nap and 'Geechee discovered him and routed him
out. He grumbled that he was sleepy and the room was quiet and
her mistress would not mind.</p>

<p>"I minds," she said severely. "You git right out o' here."</p>

<p>She carried her protective instinct to embarrassing lengths.
One Saturday night we had the house full after a football game.
Half a dozen decided to spend the night. In the morning there
were not enough eggs for making the unexpected breakfast and I
sent her down the road to Old Boss to see if he could spare a
dozen. She reported on their conversation, proud of the way she
had protected me.</p>

<p>"Well, 'Geechee," Old Boss said to her, "your Missus had quite
a party last night."</p>

<p>"I looked him right in the eye," she said, "and I says to him,
'No, sir, that wasn't no party. That was jus' a few of her
kin-folks dropped in to visit her, and she was so proud to see
'em.'"</p>

<p>My life was circumspect, but if I had lived in scarlet sin,
'Geechee would have covered my tracks. A man came from the citrus
packing house on business. I was ill in bed and she showed him in
to my bedroom without consulting me. I was a trifle embarrassed
and when he came again the next day to report on the matter, I
said to her, "When I'm in bed and a man comes to see me, I'd a
little rather you stood near the doorway."</p>

<p>She showed him in and disappeared. After he had gone and I
questioned her, I found that, loyal soul, all the while he was
there she had stood sentinel at the front door--watching the
highway.</p>

<p>It was after Leroy had gone that I began to realize the source
of her occasional high spirits. There were times when she sang so
infectiously from the kitchen or over the washtubs that I would
stop my work and follow the old spiritual with her. That anomaly,
"Prohibition," was still in force, and our liquor was good
moonshine from the Florida scrub. We bought it almost openly,
bringing it home in five-gallon glass demijohns and siphoning it
off into charred oak kegs to ripen. The local sheriff was in
cahoots with the moonshiners, arresting only those who did not
pay his weekly tribute. A plutocrat was one who could buy 'shine
enough ahead of his needs to have always a fully mature supply on
hand. The riff-raff drank from hand to mouth of improperly aged
liquor, and it was a mark of caste to serve one's "corn" not less
than six or eight months old. I managed to put by two five-gallon
kegs, for it was enough for friends to drive twenty-five miles to
call on me, without offering them raw liquor.</p>

<p>When I breached the first keg, there were only three gallons
in it. I was appalled at the rate of evaporation and decided that
the modest original price did not prove out so cheaply after all.
When I siphoned off the second keg, the contents were two
gallons. On that day 'Geechee was unusually blithe. An unhappy
suspicion came to me. I questioned her. One may usually spare
one's breath in questioning a Negro about a theft, especially
that of liquor. The slave status has made the lie a social
necessity. 'Geechee freely admitted having helped herself. She
had not even bothered to use the siphon. She had simply heaved
the keg up on her shoulder when she wanted a drink and poured out
a tumblerful.</p>

<p>"It's the onliest way I can make out," she said. "It's the
onliest thing lifts my heart up, times I think I'm jus' obliged
to die."</p>

<p>There could be no answer. We compromised by my parcelling out
as much as I thought she needed, but it was never enough. Her
grief, her burden, was too great. She found her way, like water
seeping through a crack, to whatever stores I had locked or
hidden. Once when I was away I left her a quart and locked a new
keg in my own bedroom cupboard, taking with me the key. When I
returned, the lock was undisturbed and the keg was half empty.
She had taken the door off the hinges, she told me. Her despair
was greater than I knew. I thought that we were getting on very
well, when suddenly, just before Christmas, she got hold of a
gallon of her own, got rousing drunk, and simply walked away. I
woke up to a strangely silent house, with no good sounds from the
kitchen of stove lids thumping, no sweet smell of coffee, no
murmur of 'Geechee's morning humming.</p>

<p>A freeze came in the night before Christmas. On Christmas
morning the pipes were frozen solid, there was no water for
coffee, the woodpile was depleted and I had to chop enough for a
fire in the living room. I sat huddled over it, longing for the
black girl's feet shuffling toward me with comfort and help.
There came instead a message from a passer-by that 'Geechee had
told that she had not quit me nor been fired. She was only taking
a vacation. Time proved what I suspected. She had taken her
savings and gone to Jacksonville to make sure that Leroy was
being properly cared for.</p>

<p>I waited a long time for her to come back to me. The weeks
passed and there was no word. I believe that she was too ashamed
of having abandoned me to return without word from me. If I had
understood the Negro psychology as well then as now, I should
have gone after her. Exasperated with too much cow and too little
firewood, I hired a Negro couple, Kate and Raymond. We settled
down into a semblance of comfort, and while Kate was pretty and
flip and impudent, she was clever and willing, and Raymond's long
arms swinging the axe at the woodpile looked to me like the
flutter of angels' wings. But life was not the same. That small
bright flame of loving devotion was put out, and sitting in front
of Raymond's roaring log fires, I was still cold. More than a
year went by. It was a good year, with a new gay friend to
initiate me into duck-hunting. The hunt on the lake was good, and
coming home at night, with supper of quail and red wine and
biscuits, and good talk by the fire. But 'Geechee was gone.</p>

<p>In late spring I sailed comfortably from off an intractable
horse and broke my neck and fractured my skull. I rode the horse
back to the stables and dismissed the incident. No one has ever
had an easier experience with a serious accident. I put in a week
not too badly, ending with paddling a boat all day while my
friend cast for bass. Then the pain became a nightmare and I was
a little out of my mind. My good Tampa doctor friend came with
Dessie, his wife, for the week end, and said, "You don't seem to
know it, but you have a broken neck." X-rays confirmed his easy
diagnosis. There were weeks nursed by them in Tampa and the
doctor fitted me with a steel brace that I thought gave me the
noble look of Joan of Arc in armor, chin lifted, listening to the
Voices, but that seemed to strike others dumb with horror. I was
ready to go home. I could drive a car, could go on with my work,
but I could not bathe nor dress myself nor adjust the brace.
Dessie had already given me too generous a share of her time. The
doctor knew of a good practical white nurse who would go home
with me. I did not want her. I was re-writing a book and I did
not want to take time out from it to be polite to her. I wanted
'Geechee.</p>

<p>Dessie drove me to Hawthorn where 'Geechee's mother lived. The
girl had been following the strawberry season as a picker. We
followed two blind trails. The third took us south to the
outskirts of Plant City. We inquired at a Negro soft-drink stand.
She was not known by her name of Beatrice. I described her
big-boned frame, her one blind white eye. The Negro chuckled.</p>

<p>"You mean 'Geechee. There's a gal us don't fool with. An' you
won't find her around no soft-drink stand. 'Geechee got to have
somethin' stronger'n that."</p>

<p>He knew where she was living and we drove into the yard. She
came out to the car. At sight of me in my apparatus tears
streamed down her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, my white lamb," she cried out, "what they been doin' to
you?"</p>

<p>She knew why we had come before we told her. She gathered up
her pitiful belongings--she was sending her money to Leroy.
Dessie drove us home to the Creek. It was like being in the hands
of a black Florence Nightingale. All of us, no matter how
self-reliant, long, I think, for tenderness. Her big rough hands
touched me as gently as though I were made of glass, instead of
being almost as sturdy as she. In the bath, she washed and dried
me with a feather touch. She lingered over it, giving great
attention at last to the toes, and once she chuckled and
whispered under her breath, "Such little white footses--." They
were little and white only in comparison with her own.</p>

<p>For two weeks she did not touch a drop of liquor. Then the old
need came over her, and her breath reeked, and she wavered in
helping me from the tub. Sometimes when I called she did not hear
me, and Kate came saucily to report that "'Geechee asleep--leas',
I reckon she's asleep," and laughed. My heart ached. One Sunday
morning two months after she had come, I awoke to pandemonium.
Stove lids were being dropped on the floor, or thrown there.
Dishes crashed. I heard shrieks from the tenant house. After a
long time, 'Geechee reeled into my room.</p>

<p>"Kate an' Raymond's fightin'," she announced. "But don't you
worry."</p>

<p>She staggered out and the racket began again in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>She came to my door and said, "The bacon done burnt itself up,
but don't you fret."</p>

<p>After half an hour she appeared to say, "Kate is chasin'
Raymond thu the grove with a butcher knife. But you jes' lay
still and don't worry."</p>

<p>I did not see her again. I lay helpless and hopeful, but there
was no further sound. It was all hopeless. My breaks were nearly
healed, and in her many delinquencies I had found that I could
adjust the brace myself. I got myself dressed after a fashion and
went to the back door and called her. There was no answer. In
late afternoon she appeared, half sober.</p>

<p>She said, "I know I got to go. I ain't no use to nobody. It
comes over me and I can't help it. No use foolin' with me, I
won't never be no different."</p>

<p>Kate and Raymond appeared sheepishly.</p>

<p>"It was me got 'em drunk," 'Geechee said. "They didn't aim to
do it. Kate an' Raymond's all right."</p>

<p>I paid her and told Raymond to drive her home in the truck to
her mother.</p>

<p>"I hate to part this way," I said.</p>

<p>"Me, too," and she was gone.</p>

<p>No maid of perfection--and now I have one--can fill the
strange emptiness she left in a remote corner of my heart. I
think of her often, and I know she does of me, for she comes once
a year to see me. I put my arms around her big bony shoulders and
she pats my back comfortingly. She is always a little drunk. She
goes from one job to another, losing it always for the same
reason. The last time she came I was away.</p>

<p>Little Will reported, "The 'Geechee girl was here to see you.
She sure was high. She said she tried to go without drinkin',
times, but seemed like she'd lose her mind, didn't she have it.
She said she knowed she'd still be here with you, could she
change. She said tell you they ain't nothin' nobody can do about
it."</p>

<h2><a name="c11">11. <i>A pig is paid for</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I suppose there is nowhere in the world a more elemental
exchange of goods than among ourselves at the Creek. The exchange
does not even become barter and trade. We merely return favors.
Old Boss uses my truck to haul his vegetable crops to the station
and I use his mules for my occasional light plowing. We have
never sat down to figure which has the higher rental value, for
it does not matter. I have the only pecan trees at the Creek, so
each fall two or three families pick the crop for me, by their
request, and take for pay only enough pecans to last them through
the winter. They refuse the actual cash value of the work. As a
matter of fact, they could not have been hired. One fisherman
borrows a few dollars of me in lean times, and I have a drawing
account for fish, never calculated exactly, but well tipped in my
favor. Another man borrows between jobs and appears unsummoned
when a freeze comes in and I must fire my young orange grove.
Sometimes his two or three nights of the cold and arduous work
come to much more than he has borrowed and he waves aside the
proffered difference.</p>

<p>"You don't owe me a nickel," he says.</p>

<p>I contracted one debt, however, that involved me in so
labyrinthine a maze that I thought I should never find my way out
of it. It was my punishment, I suppose, for shooting a pig of Mr.
Martin's. I never planned to shoot the pig and I certainly didn't
know it belonged to Mr. Martin. As a matter of fact, I didn't
care. It could have belonged to the devil himself, and many a
morning I was sure of it. I am a patient woman as far as other
people's stock is concerned. I know stock. If I were a pig, I
should search out the green pastures, as did the pigs of Mr.
Martin. If I knew where skimmed milk lay white and frothy in open
pans, I should push my way under a stout barbed-wire fence and
bury my snout in that milk. But even if I were a pig, I can see
no reason for rooting up fluffy-ruffle petunias.</p>

<p>There were eight of the pigs. The first thing I heard every
morning at daybreak was the whole outfit crashing under the fence
and rushing under the floor of my bedroom for a matutinal rubbing
of backs against the crosspiece. The rubbing ended, and the
grunts, my room stopped shaking, and the commotion passed. I
turned over for a nap. While I was napping, the happy
congregation moved on to the trays of biddy-mash, the skimmed
milk and the fluffy-ruffle petunias. Fluffy-ruffle petunias are
delicate plants. The seed is as expensive as gold dust and as
fine. It takes weeks to germinate. The seedlings must be nursed
by hand. When transplanted, they are the prey of cutworms, of
drought, of the slightest adversity. Once brought months later to
maturity, the huge multicolored blooms represent beauty flowered
into life by the most desperate of measures. So while I could
forgive the heavy supplying to alien porkers of chicken feed and
milk, I simply could not forgive the fluffy-ruffle petunias. The
intruders dug up altogether four consecutive plantings and on the
third uprooting I was a trifle demented. I lay in watch.</p>

<p>I discovered that the litter had a leader. He was as pretty a
young barrow as I have ever seen, Titian-haired and light of
spirit and rounded into delicious curves by his long diet of
biddy-mash, skimmed milk and petunias. It was he who broke his
way through and under the fence, he who raced joyously under my
bedroom to scratch, he who galloped, butt wobbling, tail curling,
to the trays of feed and the petunia bed. His brothers and
sisters only followed where he led. Where they came from, where
they went when the sun had set, I did not know. I knew only that
the bright-red barrow was my enemy. One morning I sat on my
veranda. The litter was peaceful, ready to lie quietly and
decently in the shade. But not the red-bristled fiend. He pranced
to the front yard and gave himself with abandon to my fourth
planting of fluffy-ruffle petunias. I arose as one in a trance,
picked up my gun, stepped to the petunia bed and shot him dead
where he fed.</p>

<p>Psychologists might say, trying me before a jury of my peers,
that murder lay ready in my heart. The act was not premeditated,
yet the will to kill was waiting. I know only that I pulled the
trigger with joy and looked down at my fallen foe with delight
and triumph. There would be no more battening of outlaw stock on
feed and flowers. I wondered to whom the pigs belonged. They were
none of my immediate neighbors'. I looked again at the red
menace. He was appallingly fat and succulent. I picked him up by
his curly tail, put him in my car and drove to Citra. I arranged
to have Mr. Hogan dress him, and Ward the storekeeper to store
him in his refrigerator. I sent a wire to my friend Norton in
Ocala, "Bring ten or twelve Saturday night for whole roast pig
barbecue."</p>

<p>The roast pig was perfection. The meat was as white as the
skimmed milk and the petunia roots on which it had been fattened.
After, I read aloud Charles Lamb's essay on "Roast Pig." It was a
fine evening.</p>

<p>On Sunday, neighbor Tom stopped by and said with a queer look
in his eyes, "You been having pig trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's all over."</p>

<p>"Could be, it's just begun. You know anything about the man
named Martin?"</p>

<p>"Never heard of him."</p>

<p>"Well, he's settled across the Creek. Put out the word he's a
man won't be trifled with. Has notches on his gun. I just
wondered." He went away.</p>

<p>On Monday morning I heard knuckles pound on the steps at the
side porch. A huge man stood there with his broad-brimmed Stetson
hat pushed back from his forehead.</p>

<p>"Mornin'. My name's Martin."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Martin. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>He shifted his weight.</p>

<p>"Mis' Rawlings, do you remember hit rainin' last Monday?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, Mr. Martin, I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, hit rained. Mis' Rawlings, do you remember loandin'
your truck to Dorsey Townsend last Monday?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. I don't remember that it was Monday, but he
borrowed it one day last week."</p>

<p>"Well, hit were Monday. Mis' Rawlings"--he squinted casually
at the sky--"do you remember a gun shootin' last Monday? A
12-gauge, maybe. Maybe a 16. Could of been a 20."</p>

<p>"Why, yes indeed," I said. "It was I who shot. I shot a pig.
With my 20-gauge. I don't know whose pig it was. It led a pack
that came through my stock-proof fences. It tormented me to
death. Why, Mr. Martin, maybe it was your pig. The mark was a
half-moon in one ear and a bit in the other."</p>

<p>He drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"That were my pig," he said.</p>

<p>He stared at me.</p>

<p>"Of course," I said, "I expect to pay for it. In a way, I had
a right to shoot it, because it was an outlaw. In another way,
the right is on your side, because in a no-fence county you have
the right to turn your stock loose. But I'll pay for it very
gladly. Oh, Mr. Martin, I did so enjoy shooting that pig."</p>

<p>He stepped back and studied me.</p>

<p>"Them pigs was practically pets," he said.</p>

<p>"They were very tame," I said. "That was the trouble."</p>

<p>"You could of ketched it with your bare hands," he
lamented.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Martin," I said, "but then I wouldn't have had the
pleasure of shooting it."</p>

<p>Suddenly I remembered the notches on his gun.</p>

<p>"In a way, Mr. Martin," I said, "I'm sorry. But that's the way
I am. I go along quietly for a while, and then out of a clear sky
I just don't know what I'm doing. I pick up a gun and I shoot
whatever makes me angry. This time it was a pig. I'm so afraid
some time it may be a person. After it was over, I'd be terribly
sorry. But then it would be too late, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>He wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think," he burst out. "From the
beginning, I ain't knowed what to think. I went to all your
neighbors, and they all said, 'Oh, no, Mis' Rawlings wouldn't do
a thing like that.' But all the time something told me, if you
got mad enough, you'd do it."</p>

<p>"It's too bad, isn't it?" I condoled with him. "When I'm so
sorry afterward."</p>

<p>He grew confidential.</p>

<p>"I heard the shot and I placed it about here, and my pig come
up missing. I stopped Dorsey and I got it out of him he'd heard
you shoot. I went to Citra and I found out where you'd had it
dressed and where you'd had it stored, and they all said, 'Why,
yes, Mis' Rawlings come in with a pig she said she'd shot.' I saw
the constable and turned out he was a buddy of yours and he just
laughed. I studied and I studied and I decided to have the law on
you. I aimed to put you in the jailhouse. And if they wouldn't
put you in the jailhouse I aimed to settle it my way. I aimed to
make all the trouble for you I knew to do. And now--now you talk
so honest--why, I just don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about it another minute," I soothed him. "Now
it's all over, and I'm so sorry, I can't bear to have you
worried. You just decide on your price, and whatever that pig was
worth to you, why, it's worth the same to me. And if you'd rather
have another pig of the same size and pedigree, I'll replace
it."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to figure the price," he said. "I'd not of
dreamed of selling one of them pigs."</p>

<p>He turned away, then back again.</p>

<p>"I could of stood everything," he said, "but then you went and
had a drunken party--and <i>ate</i> it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Martin," I said, "the meat was delicious. I wish I'd
sent you some. I never had better pork in my life. And why
wouldn't it be good? It had fed on biddy-mash and skimmed milk
and fluffy-ruffle petunias."</p>

<p>I suppose that Mr. Martin gave it all up then as a matter in
the realm of madness. He went away, murmuring that the pig was
beyond price and replacement would be practically impossible. I
gave no further thought to pig or payment, waiting for the bill
to arrive. The pig was worth several dollars, but I decided that
I would pay anything up to fifteen without protest. Or I should
go to market and buy its valuable duplicate. And then Mr.
Higgenbotham entered the picture.</p>

<p>My relations with Mr. Higgenbotham were already involved.</p>

<p>We first became friends over the matter of snakes. Adrenna
came mincing to my room one morning as though she were announcing
the President.</p>

<p>"Mr. Higgenbotham is calling," she said. "Mr. Higgenbotham
wishes to show you a snake."</p>

<p>I put on a house-coat and went to the front door. I knew Mr.
Higgenbotham to speak to, for his ramshackle open truck passed
the house going and coming on his business of frog-hunting and
snake-catching. Mr. Higgenbotham is a small ragged man with hair
shaggy in his eyes. He had his campaign planned. As I came to the
door, he held up one hand in command, unfurled a crocus sack, and
with great drama rolled a large king snake onto the grass.</p>

<p>"There! Look at him! Six foot long! I ain't been getting but
forty cents for 'em. I just want you to see. Why, a snake like
that is worth forty cents in the woods!"</p>

<p>His grievance, it appeared, was over the low market on
snakes.</p>

<p>"You know folks in the up-country," he said, "and I want you
to see can you get me a better market for my snakes."</p>

<p>His confidence touched me. I could think of no friend at the
moment who might be interested in upping the price on king
snakes. But I assured him that I would do my best. A king snake
six feet long was certainly worth forty cents in the woods. We
became immediately fast friends. The king snake was to Mr.
Higgenbotham an individual. It was his pet and its name was
Oscar. He put it through its tricks. It coiled like a rattlesnake
and struck playfully at him. He tapped it on its glistening
head.</p>

<p>"That's enough o' that, Oscar. You wouldn't believe how smart
he is. I cain't fool him on his rations. I hold a little snake
for him, or a mouse, and he takes it as dainty as a lady. Give
him a stick or a strip of shoestring and he turns away disgusted.
And when I turn him a-loose, he's after the rats in the house
like lightning."</p>

<p>Foolishly, idiotically, regretting it in an instant, I said,
"That's fine. I have terrible trouble with rats in my attic."</p>

<p>"I'll lend you Oscar," he said. "I want to do something for
you, helping me with my business. I'll put Oscar in your
attic."</p>

<p>I could have cut out my tongue. Mr. Higgenbotham was gathering
up Oscar with enthusiasm, to put him in my attic.</p>

<p>"It's all sealed up," I said. "We couldn't very well get to
it."</p>

<p>"We'll cut a hole," he said. "Oscar would have to have a hole,
anyway, so he could come down to get water."</p>

<p>I had visions of awakening and staring into the black beady
eyes of Oscar, come down for water. The rats seemed pleasant
companions.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be safe," I said, inspired. "My cat is death on
snakes."</p>

<p>He put Oscar reluctantly into the crocus sack.</p>

<p>"Well--I'd sure hate to have that happen."</p>

<p>I was so happy to be rid of Oscar that I did my best about the
snake market. I wrote to Ditmars and to the Cincinnati Zoo and
the Washington Zoo. The replies were courteous and I think
amused. The general opinion was that if my friend was getting
forty cents for king snakes, he was doing nicely. The big zoos
had their own collectors and snakes were a glut on the market.
Mr. Higgenbotham was grateful for my efforts, satisfied now with
his price. He waved violently whenever his truck passed my house.
He usually had a cross-eyed child with him, and I could see him
nudge the child, so that it too waved to me. One day Mr.
Higgenbotham stopped and came up the path with the unhappy air of
a man about to try to borrow money.</p>

<p>"I'm in a tight," he said, "and you're my friend, and I
figgered you was the one to help me out. The sheriffs been after
me and been after me about a license for my truck. 'I cain't let
you keep that thing on the highways no longer without no
license,' he said to me. He said, 'I hate to be hard on a poor
man, but next time I catch you out without no license, I'm
obliged to run you in.'"</p>

<p>"How much do you need?"</p>

<p>"Not but six dollars. I'll give you a mortgage on the
truck."</p>

<p>I looked at it. There was not six dollars' worth of usable
parts of any description.</p>

<p>"Or," he added, "in a pinch, I could work it out."</p>

<p>The idea seemed feasible enough. I gave Mr. Higgenbotham six
dollars and he agreed to work it out in pruning on my orange
trees. Days passed, and weeks, and Mr. Higgenbotham passed and
re-passed on his frog- and snake-hunting expeditions and did not
stop to prune. It is one thing to help a friend in distress and
it is another thing to be done. I was on the roadside one day
picking up pecans and flagged down Mr. Higgenbotham. It took him
a hundred yards to stop. He backed up. The cross-eyed child began
waving dutifully.</p>

<p>"Don't speak," Mr. Higgenbotham shouted. "Don't say it. I know
what you're thinking. You're thinking I got no intentions o'
paying back what I borrowed. Mis' Rawlings, I had the confidence
in you not to borrow without I meant to pay it back. I got my
plans. You just wait now. The moon won't be out this month
without I pay back that six dollars."</p>

<p>He drove off with a flourish and the child waved as far as it
could see. The next week the truck stopped at my gate. In the
back stood trussed a lean gray razor-back sow. Mr. Higgenbotham
walked jauntily up the path.</p>

<p>"Want to buy a pig?" he called.</p>

<p>"It's just about the last thing in the world I want to buy," I
said with possible bitterness.</p>

<p>"Couldn't use a pig to trade?" he asked and winked at me.
"Can't think of nobody now you owe a pig to?"</p>

<p>Understanding struck me.</p>

<p>"I do owe a pig to Mr. Martin," I said, "but how did you
know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody knows you owe Mr. Martin a pig. Now what I got
figgered out is this. That sow there is worth six dollars if
she's worth a cent. I owe you six dollars. If Mr. Martin takes
that sow, you've paid him and I've paid you. Now how about
it?"</p>

<p>I looked at the rangy creature in the truck.</p>

<p>"What makes you think Mr. Martin will take her?"</p>

<p>"Well, when you figger on a sow, you figger on more than a
sow. You buy you a sow, and directly you've got a litter of pigs
to boot. You've got the sow and you've got eight-ten pigs and the
pigs'll soon make shoats and you carry the shoats to market and
you get good money for 'em and you've yet got the sow. Now I'm
carrying that sow there to Mr. Martin's boar hog. You know
sows?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "not very well."</p>

<p>"Well, a sow's peculiar. Times, she'll take, and again she'll
not take. It all depends on the moon. Now last moon, she'd not of
took. This moon, I figger she'll take. And if she takes--mind, if
she takes--Mr. Martin'll take her for the debt. 'Course, if she
don't take, I'm the one loses. In that case, I got a dollar to
pay for the use o' the boar."</p>

<p>It seemed very complicated, between Mr. Martin and Mr.
Higgenbotham and the rental stud of boars and the ways of sows
and the moon, but I had little to lose.</p>

<p>"Very well. If the sow takes, and Mr. Martin accepts her for
my debt to him, then your debt to me is paid. Right?"</p>

<p>"Righter'n rain," and he drove off with the gray sow lurching
in the back of the truck and the child waving.</p>

<p>Time passed and I had no bill from Mr. Martin and no call from
Mr. Higgenbotham. The situation was a little delicate, for a lady
is not supposed to inquire too closely into matters either of
debts or of breeding. Then I ran into Mr. Martin in the grocery
store on a Saturday night in Citra. He was cordial. He was
effusive.</p>

<p>"You do any duck-hunting?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes."</p>

<p>"A quick shot like you," he said, "I figgered you'd enjoy
duck-hunting. Now when winter comes and you're ready, you just
get me word and I'll carry you out to the best duck stand on
Orange Lake."</p>

<p>Surely something must have been settled. The moon must have
been right. In the formality of the store I could not inquire of
the intimate relation of the gray sow to Mr. Martin's boar. I
longed to say, "Did she take? Are we all square, you and Mr.
Higgenbotham and I?"</p>

<p>I said, "The pig I owed you for. The one I was to
replace--"</p>

<p>He put out a big hand for me to shake.</p>

<p>"Mis' Rawlings," he said, "the pig is paid for."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c12">12. <i>My friend Moe</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Sometimes there are friendships that have no apparent reason
for existence, between people set apart by every circumstance of
life, yet so firm in their foundations that they survive
conditions that would separate friends of more apparent
suitability. My friendship with Moe was one of these. Moe said
and believed that we were friends because we needed each
other.</p>

<p>In the village he said once, "Me and her is buddies, see? If
her gate falls down, I go and fix it. If I git in a tight for
money she helps me if she's got it, and if she ain't got it, she
gits it for me. We stick together. You got to stick to the bridge
that carries you across."</p>

<p>If he had never fixed a gate for me, waving aside any offer of
pay, leaving a profitable carpenter's job to do it--for I
certainly could not be bothered with the neighbors' stock coming
in, could I?--if I had never scratched up a dollar for him, Moe
and I would have been friends. Beyond our admiration of something
in each other that might pass for courage, beyond our mutual
helpfulness, there was a warm tenderness that made us like just
to sit down together on the back steps and talk about the world
as we saw it, while three or four of his boys squatted patiently
on their heels waiting for us to be finished.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would wave his arm at them and boom in his deep
voice, "You scapers go on, and eat oranges now. Me and her ain't
half done talkin'."</p>

<p>He introduced himself on my first Christmas Day at the Creek.
He came out with a man named Whitey and it was a formal Christmas
call. I was bustling about cooking Christmas dinner, some of the
family were there, and Moe and Whitey sat on the back steps and
visited with the men. It was long past the country noon dinner
hour and I grew uneasy as the turkey browned and the squash and
potatoes were done and the hard sauce finished for the plum
pudding. I took my outdoor shower and dressed. I delayed, pushing
the gravy to the back of the wood range. Moe and Whitey sat on.
The turkey was beginning to dry out and the sauce had stood too
long on the oyster cocktails in the ice-box.</p>

<p>In desperation, I said, "Dinner is ready. Won't you men join
us?"</p>

<p>According to my bringing up, that was the signal for uninvited
guests to be on their way. I found that in rural Florida, to
refuse an invitation to a meal, if one is there at the time it is
ready or nearly so, is to insult hospitality so grievously that
the damage can seldom be repaired. Moe and Whitey had of course
had their dinner, but to my horror Moe said, "Thank you, Ma'am,"
led Whitey to the pump stand to wash up and came in. The family
dinner was ruined for me. The intruders were as unhappy as I, but
applied themselves with lowered heads and high-lifted elbows to
their plates. Whitey was plainly only a follower and I stole a
look at Moe. He was a great burly man with long arms and thick
shoulders, slightly hunched from years of labor. His head was
massive and beyond a full fine forehead the receding hair was
shaggy and leonine. There was the look there of a man who might
have been a statesman. He had one of the most beautiful speaking
voices that I have ever heard. It had the deep resonance of a
bass fiddle.</p>

<p>He plowed his way through the many-coursed dinner without
comment. When I served the plum pudding that had taken so long to
make and decorate, he looked briefly at the blanched almonds and
sugared fruits on the top and scraped them to one side, as I
should scrape unexpected insects. The dinner had been one of my
best, and it seemed to me from the rough worn clothes and the
backwoods speech that it must surely have been a little out of
the ordinary for these men. My vanity about my cooking is known
and pandered to, and it seemed incredible to me that uninvited
guests like these should not only pay me no compliments, but
should have put down the choice dishes like so much hay.</p>

<p>I said, "You men have just eaten a typical Yankee Christmas
dinner. Now tell me, what is the usual Cracker Christmas
dinner?"</p>

<p>Moe lifted his big head and looked at me gravely.</p>

<p>"Whatever we can git, Ma'am," he said. "Whatever we can
git."</p>

<p>I should have given the dinner and all my work over it, not to
have asked that question.</p>

<p>I heard later that in the village Moe described the meal dish
by dish. He spoke even of the edible decorations on the plum
pudding that he rejected.</p>

<p>"A meal like that," I was told he said, "a feller don't know
what's cold-out rations and what's fancy fixin's. When I seed her
face, I knowed I'd ought to of run the risk and et
everything."</p>

<p>I do not remember when we became friends. The occasion is
bound to have been one when he did me some kindness. It seems to
me that it was the hot Sunday morning when he passed by with his
boys from a night's frog-hunting and found me in hell. I shall
always associate my conception of hell with hot Sunday summer
mornings at the Creek. And why Sunday morning? Because that is
when the drinking portion of the Negro help fails to arrive.</p>

<p>The Sunday morning that Moe stopped by was one of these. I was
without household help at the time and I slept late without
hearing a sound on the place to disturb me. The lowing of the cow
finally penetrated my sleep and I awoke in a humid heat to an
uneasy sense that all was not well. I dressed and went out to the
stillness of a desert island. I do not remember which of the
procession of Negro men was the culprit, but whoever he was, he
was not there.</p>

<p>The cow was old Laura, weather-beaten, gray and gaunt, and the
only cow I have known with a more evil nature than hers, is her
daughter Dora. Laura was busily and angrily engaged in tearing
down the pasture fence. An early daughter, then a calf, little
Atrocia, a repulsive creature whom I later traded to a Negro for
a week's hoeing, was jumping back and forth through the hole in
the fence that Laura had begun. The young bull had broken through
the fence by the road, and at sight of me began bellowing and
pawing the earth. The chickens, unfed and protesting, got under
my feet and tripped me as I made my way through the sandspurs to
the pasture gate. It had been fastened with an intricate African
arrangement of chains, and by the time I had them loosened and
the gate swung wide, Laura had knocked down two more fence posts
and was making her way loftily to the barn.</p>

<p>She then decided to be coy, and food being what I supposed she
wanted, refused to go into the pen where it waited. She gambolled
like a heifer through the grove, her bony hips heaving, little
Atrocia at her heels in delight at the sudden friskiness of her
aged parent. I was obliged to give up getting her into the pen. I
lugged the feed trough out into the open by the barn and brought
a bucket of water, for the lake was low beside the pasture and
the stock must be watered by hand. I went into the barn for feed.
A new sack had to be opened and I bruised my fingers working at
the chain-stitch binding. I took a bucket of the feed and emptied
it into the trough. Laura was in front of the house eating blue
plumbago blossoms and asparagus fern. I climbed up the rickety
ladder to the hayloft to pitch down hay, for the bull must have
some of this too. A chicken snake and two rats ran across my feet
as I lifted a forkful. A leather-winged bat, disturbed from its
slumbers in the rafters, swooped out of the loft, brushing my
hair. A setting hen under the hay flew into my face and floated
to earth, squawking and shrilling. I pitched down the hay and
descended the ladder. The next to the last rung broke under me
and I slid to the ground and walked limping to the feed trough.
Laura had come, eaten all the feed, and was now over by the
tenant house. Being full, she had no intention of standing for
milking. She had a greedy nature and I lured her back to the
trough with another bucket of feed. The calf was only two months
old, though weaned, and Laura's bag in mid-morning was full and
tight. I had never milked in my life. I had never expected to
milk in my life. I should not have tried it now, but I was
certain Laura would burst if she were not somehow relieved.</p>

<p>I knelt down beside her, put the milk bucket under her, and
tightened my fingers around two of the udders. Nothing happened.
With her mouth dripping feed, Laura turned her head over her
shoulder and looked at me, as though to say, "What on earth are
you doing?" In annoyance, she moved a foot to the side. I moved
too. I began again. I constricted desperately, trying to recall
the motion I had seen the milkers use. The knack suddenly came to
me, and I saw the first thin streams of milk drop into the bucket
as though I had brought up pearls from the sea. By this time the
second bucket of feed was gone, Laura walked off, and I was
obliged to go for a third bucket and lure her back again. She was
indifferent, but she had become also a little lethargic, and I
got her back to the trough. This time, because she ate so slowly,
I got a quart of milk. A sense of proud competence filled me. I
was dripping with perspiration and the flies hummed around us.
When they stung me, I went frantically on with my milking. When
they stung Laura, she switched her long tail across my face. Now
she stood immobile, ruminating placidly. With no provocation at
all, because the stinging flies were on me, she lifted a hind
foot and kicked the bucket of milk into my lap. I looked at her
bag. It seemed as full as ever. I went back to the milking.
Humanitarian motives had left me, but I did not want a good milch
cow to swell up and die. I got another pint, and Laura lifted a
hind leg and kicked me square in the middle. There was only one
thing left to do. I kicked her in the middle, said to her, "You
may burst for all of me," and she stalked off into the
coffee-weed. I tottered to the pen to close the gate. It was at
this moment that Moe and his boys drew up by the fence and hailed
me.</p>

<p>His big voice boomed out, "What you doin' with a milk
bucket?"</p>

<p>I leaned weakly on the fence to answer him.</p>

<p>"My man didn't show up and I tried to milk the cow."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>He was already putting his long legs out of the old car. His
boys tumbled out behind him.</p>

<p>"Over there in the coffee-weed. I hope she pops wide
open."</p>

<p>I must have begun then to know him as a friend, for he did not
laugh. He gave directions to the boys and they scattered to the
points of the compass. Two of them drove back the cow. Two made a
noose of a rope from the barn. All together they held her tied
tight to an orange tree while Moe rested on his heels and milked
and stripped her.</p>

<p>"What else you got around here ain't done?"</p>

<p>The chickens had not been fed and water for all the animals
had not been pumped. They did that.</p>

<p>Moe said, "Now if that nigger don't show up by evenin', you
leave me know. I'll go find him and take a whip to him, leavin'
you like this."</p>

<p>He was always indignant when he found me doing work that he
considered too difficult or too heavy, and called his boys in a
swarm to take over. They were silent, unsmiling youngsters,
undersized and pale. They went to school passively, and since
they showed no interest in education, Moe was trying to train
them in his own profession of carpentering, and was teaching them
frog-hunting on the side.</p>

<p>"Them scapers is the best frog hunters in the county," he
said. "No fear o' them or their mammy starvin' when I'm done for,
long as they can haul in a hundred pounds o' frogs of a
night."</p>

<p>The boys smiled then, wanly. The irresponsible night hunting
was to their taste. I am sure the carpentering was not, though
they did accurate enough work under Moe's critical eye. Moe's
true love was an orange grove, and he would have liked to raise
oranges for a living. His father, and his grandfather before him,
had been superintendent for the Fairbanks grove, one of the
oldest Florida groves, of which my choice seven acres in Big
Hammock is a part. Moe had lived on the grove as a boy. One day I
heard his voice giving orders at the gate. The boys were bringing
in a bedstead. It was handmade, spool turned, of pine, put
together with wooden pegs. It had the grace of all good handmade
things.</p>

<p>"This mought seem like pure trash to you," Moe said, and the
boys set the bed down in front of me. "But if you want it, it's
yours. It was made for Major Fairbanks, and before he died he
give it to my daddy. It's been out in the barn for fifty years.
You want it?"</p>

<p>The bed had real value as Floridiana. There are almost no
native Florida antiques. Major Fairbanks was not only a famous
early grove owner, but the founder and first president of the
Florida Historical Society and the author of <i>Fairbanks'
History of Florida</i> and the <i>History and Antiquities of St.
Augustine,</i> both now collectors' items.</p>

<p>I said, "It's beautiful, Moe, but it's valuable. You should
keep it."</p>

<p>"We got no use fer it," he said contemptuously, not of the
bed, but of his household's way of life, which grieved him. "The
way I got to figgerin', a thing belongs to be used and used
right, and you livin' nice, and havin' a piece o' the Major's old
grove, why, you're the one to have it. Been layin' up all these
years waitin' for the right person."</p>

<p>The bed is now my own, and it is promised when I am done with
it to the Historical Society.</p>

<p>I did not understand it at the time, but as I look back on our
friendship, I believe that Moe lived vicariously in my grove and
in my "livin' nice." He was intrigued with every detail of my
housekeeping. He put in a new kitchen floor for me, saying of the
old one through which 'Geechee had scrubbed a hole, "Why, Ma'am,
they was places you could of throwed a dog through it." As he
worked, he noticed a row of glass jars of huckleberries that I
had canned. His grave face brightened.</p>

<p>"Now that's the way to live," he said. "All the good things we
got here in Florida, blueberries and blackberries and beans and
cow-peas, all them things had ought to be canned and put up on a
clean cupboard shelf with white paper on it. That's the way my Ma
did. She lived fine, not the way you live, but just as good when
it come to cannin' things and keepin' things clean." His face
darkened. "I've tried and I've done tried to get my wife to do
that-a-way but it just ain't no use. One time I bought two dozen
glass jars and I went out by myself and I picked about a bushel
o' blackberries and I went to the store and bought a twenty-five
pound sack o' sugar and I takened it home, and I said, 'Wife,
here's a bait o' blackberries to put up for us for jam and jelly
for the winter.'" He hesitated, his loyalty pricking him.</p>

<p>"She probably didn't have time to do it," I suggested.</p>

<p>"She had time. She let the blackberries spoil, and the antses
got in the sugar, and I found the jars throwed out in the back
yard."</p>

<p>I had light on the matter when I met his mother, who came to
visit in the village. Moe brought her out and left her with me
for the day. She was of the admirable Florida pioneer type,
plump, immaculate, wise and kindly. We talked of her life on the
Fairbanks grove and we talked of Moe.</p>

<p>"It like to killed me when he married," she said. "Moe did
love bein' to home and havin' things nice. I said to him, 'Son,
don't you marry that girl. She ain't your kind and she'll not
make you the home you want.' He looked kind o' sorrowful, and he
said, real slow, 'I know, Ma. But I love the little old
thing.'"</p>

<p>Moe followed the fortunes of my grove as closely as if it had
been his own. When I planted ten acres of Valencias across the
road where the dingy pecan trees had been cut down and the vacant
space had stared at me, he rejoiced with me. We were sure that
the new ten acres would make the needed difference between profit
and loss. I had put my last hundreds of dollars in the planting
and was obliged to watch my simple grocery supplies in
consequence. I went to the Everglades in the winter on a hunting
trip with Dessie and the Chanceys. The weather in late November
was warm when we left Tampa. Cold weather set in the second day
at camp. Even so far south, we were obliged to have a roaring
camp fire night and morning, and the pond water in which we
bathed struck us with icy power. We wore sweaters under our
hunting clothes and were hard put to it, as we stood motionless
on our deer and turkey stands, not to stamp our feet and clap our
hands to keep our circulation moving against the cold. The hunt
and the companions were so delightful that I did not think to
associate the cold with any menace to my new young grove.</p>

<p>When I returned to the Creek, I found that a disastrous freeze
had come in to north and central Florida. Old groves showed much
damage, fruit was nipped, and many young groves had been frozen
to the ground. I looked across the road to my small frail
Valencia trees. A miracle had happened. They had been mounded
with earth almost to their tops and below the frozen tips they
were safe. No one could have done this but Moe. That evening I
drove in to his house to see him.</p>

<p>"Bet you was surprised," he chuckled. "The cold begun comin'
in that afternoon and it got wuss and wusser. I drove out to the
Creek to tell you somethin' had ought to be done. You wasn't
there and Martha said you was off huntin' in the south and likely
didn't know it was freezin' up here. Dogged if I aimed to let
them trees freeze behind your back. I got my boys together, and
Ivey Sykes, and Whitey, and a couple more, and I borried all the
spades and shovels in Island Grove, and we went out and we worked
all night 'til sunrise. The wust cold come in about day and by
that time we had the job done."</p>

<p>Such things that Moe did for me could never be paid for.</p>

<p>He tried me out a little later. He came out one evening with
the boys and sat stiffly on the veranda.</p>

<p>He burst out, "I got to have forty dollars. How about it?" He
looked me in the eye with something like belligerence.</p>

<p>I said, "As long as I've got it, it's yours."</p>

<p>The loan caught me very short. I wrote out the check and as I
handed it to the man, I sensed in him a feeling of triumph. He
returned the money a week later. I happened to know that he had
not worked that week. He was only making certain that he could
count on me. After that, he borrowed only when he was in dire
straits. Sometimes I myself had to borrow the money when half of
his immense family was sick, but my credit was better than his.
If he could not pay me back in cash, he paid in work worth twice
what he owed me.</p>

<p>One summer I decided to make a hurried trip to New York to
consult with my editor. I put my car in storage and bought my
ticket for New York. My grove man would drive me in the truck to
the train at the village stop. The morning that I was to leave,
Moe drove out to see me. His face was gray.</p>

<p>He said, "I'm in trouble. Mary's dyin'. Seems like I'm turned
to stone. I cain't think. I cain't figger out what to do."</p>

<p>Mary was one of the youngest of his brood of twelve, a shy
child with a certain brightness of face the others did not
possess.</p>

<p>I said, "I'll come," and drove the farm truck behind him to
his house.</p>

<p>The child lay like a crumpled rag doll on her small bed, her
blue eyelids closed, her breathing hoarse and labored. The mother
sat nearby in a slovenly incompetence. Moe had taken Mary to the
doctor two days before, and while there was a chance, he had
said, that her illness might pass into pneumonia, there was an
equal chance, with proper nursing, of no danger at all. The
pneumonia had developed rapidly and literally nothing had been
done. Moe had been ill and unable to work and his funds were
exhausted. His wife thought the illness was unimportant. The
child was plainly in a critical condition.</p>

<p>A heavy downpour of rain had set in, the roof of the farm
truck leaked like a sieve, I was dressed for my trip and had only
two hours before train time. But my own plans were trivial before
Moe's trouble. I drove to Ocala in the rain, arranged for a
doctor and a nurse, drew money out of the bank for Moe, and went
back to tell him that help was on the way. The doctor and nurse
had arrived ahead of me and were working over the sick child. Moe
looked at my soaked clothes. He dropped down on the porch of his
house and tears ran down the deep furrows of his face.</p>

<p>He said, "I hadn't ought to of let you do this. I reckon you
can't figger why I'd take on so over one young un, and me with a
whole houseful of 'em."</p>

<p>He wiped away his tears unashamed with the back of his big
hand.</p>

<p>"Mary's different," he said. "All them other young uns, and
their Ma, they don't pay me a bit o' mind. When I come home,
times they don't even pass the time o' day with me, lessen to ask
maybe did I bring home meat for supper. They don't none of 'em
care do I come or go. But Mary sets by the road and waits for me.
She comes runnin' and I carry her in on my shoulder. She calls me
'Bubber.'"</p>

<p>The tears ran like rain.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I'll live if she dies," he said. "I just
couldn't make out without Mary."</p>

<p>I took my train for New York, but I had almost forgotten why I
was going. I could not get Moe out of my mind. All day, far up
into Georgia, the rain fell, and they were Moe's tears, falling
for Mary, the only one who cared whether he came or went. All
night, the wheels of the train repeated, "Moe and Mary! Moe and
Mary!" It seemed to me that I should be obliged to get off the
train and go back to them.</p>

<p>I had a brief interview with my editor and hurried home. Mary
was safe. She smiled shyly when Moe took me to her bed. The nurse
had the sickroom in order and Moe was in his best bib and tucker.
His face was luminous.</p>

<p>"I shore went to pieces," he apologized. "When I think o' you
comin', all dressed in your best clothes and soppin' wet from
helpin' me, I'm ashamed. But them things gits made up somehow.
I'll git a chance to do somethin' for you sometime. Tell you what
I'll do. I'll take you alligator-huntin'. You ain't never been
and I'll bet you could write a fine story about it if you saw it
yourself."</p>

<p>Moe continued to keep an eye on my grove and on tottering
fences, leaking roofs and broken plumbing. He tried to keep his
own garden, single-handed, and he brought me always the first of
his crop; lettuce, squash, watermelons. He brought up the matter
of the 'gator hunt every time he came, but somehow we never got
together on it.</p>

<p>"How about that 'gator hunt tonight?" he would say and I would
have some engagement that prevented it.</p>

<p>He could not have been much past fifty in age, but he began to
break like a man much older. There were increasing periods when
he could not do his carpentering and when he could not go
frog-hunting with his boys. The last summer of his life he was
very ill. He asked if the boys might help with my summer grove
pruning. I was glad of the extra labor. At the time Moe owed me
twenty-five dollars and since I knew it fretted him, I asked if
he wanted the boys' pay applied on the debt. He hesitated.</p>

<p>"No, jest pay 'em right out," he said. "That other's somethin'
between you and me."</p>

<p>There was no hope for him. Years of improper food and
overwork, of anxiety over the future of his family, above all, I
think, despair at not living as he longed to have them live, had
eaten at his big burly frame and great gentle mind. He knew that
he was going. He sent the boys out for me one day. He sat propped
in a chair, his face gaunt, his hair tousled above the broad
forehead.</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to make it," he said and his voice was as deep
and rich as ever. "I ain't never taken you on that 'gator hunt
like I promised, and I hate that."</p>

<p>A few days later I stopped by his place, drawn by an uneasy
instinct. Moe was still propped in his chair. As I stood in the
doorway, his breath made a strangling sound in his throat and the
big head dropped forward on his chest and did not lift again. The
family stood stonily. Only Mary huddled behind his chair with a
desperate small face. Only she and I have missed him, finding the
world less generous for his going.</p>

<h2><a name="c13">13. <i>Residue</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I have my own explanation of the cynical Biblical statement
that it is as easy for a rich man to enter Heaven as for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle. On the surface, the
statement is unjust, for wealth is so accidental a thing, that
either its possession or its lack should not be held against any
man. Sift each of us through the great sieve of circumstance and
you have a residue, great or small as the case may be, that is
the man or the woman. The rich, the well-favored, the
well-situated, are surrounded with a confusing protective mass of
extraneous and irrelevant matter that tends to hide the substance
beneath. The poor, the unfortunate, have been put through the
sieve and stand nakedly for what they are. A poor and simple man
stands with bare outstretched hands at the gates of Heaven, and
his essential character is written in broad letters across him,
for life has stripped him down to it. Confronted with the
fortunate but cluttered man, St. Peter must do a neat problem in
psychiatry and estimate, "Now what would this man's honor be if
he were starving? He gives much, having a surfeit. What would he
give if he had nothing?" Being busy with the checking of
admissions to Heaven, it is conceivable that St. Peter is obliged
to tell the rich man that he must wait in the anteroom until he
can go deeper into his case.</p>

<p>These thoughts come to me when there pass down the road in
front of my house those Creek residents whom Life, shall we say,
has knocked down and sat on. There are always one or two outright
derelicts in the neighborhood, men cast adrift by life, waiting
patiently to be cast up on some hospitable and nurturing shore,
finding it, often, here. The evil and dishonorable among them do
not stay long at the Creek, for we are too busy to be bothered
with neighbors we cannot trust. We leave our houses wide open. I
sleep alone in my rambling farmhouse with never the latching of a
door, and I am away for weeks at a time, with the place as free
of access as a public picnic ground. Nothing has ever been taken.
Small tools disappear gradually, of course, from my open barn,
parts from my tractor and sometimes gasoline from my truck, but
this only because some man needs a shovel and a shovel is
available; needs a coil or a generator for his broken-down car
and a coil or generator sits invitingly in the idle tractor under
the shed; gives out of gasoline on his way from the Creek to the
village with his night's catch of frog legs and gasoline waits
providentially in the truck. This seems no more predatory than
the taking of fallen timber from the open woods, the drinking of
water from a stranger's well. Usually the silently borrowed
implements are returned as quietly as they went. Sometimes a man
says, "I forgot to tell you, I got your Brinley plow. Leave me
know when you want it." Sometimes a frog hunter leaves me a fine
mess of frog legs or an alligator hide, and I know that this is
pay for gasoline.</p>

<p>We know the character of the most destitute drifter. One or
two of these are drifters in the spiritual sense, for physically
they have come to rest at the Creek. Sometimes that character
commands our respect, for its sieved residue is sound, and we do
not hold it against a man that he goes in rags and cannot or will
not work for a living. One unfortunate is Mr. Tubble, who gets
along in life by attaching himself to one stronger than he. All
the men at the Creek feel a responsibility for him, and when evil
befalls him, usually through the medium of the jug or bottle,
they join forces and set out to find him and nurse him back to
normal.</p>

<p>He has a trick of "coming up missing." The expression is not
as contradictory as it sounds. I, for instance, never come up
missing, for it is a known habit of mine to be absent from the
Creek without explanation. My car is either under its shelter,
the porte-coch&egrave;re that Moe built and called a "cashay,"
and I am at home, or it is not under the cashay and I am simply
"off." A roving cat does not come up missing, for it is expected
of a cat that he ramble. But if a dog of steady habits is not at
the door one morning for his breakfast, that dog "comes up
missing." A misplaced household object comes up missing. A man,
like Mr. Tubble, who needs to have an eye kept on him, is
suddenly not in his usual haunts. Mr. Tubble has come up missing.
Snow came anxiously to me one day to report that it had happened
again.</p>

<p>He said, "We want to borrow your outboard motor. We've all
paddled until we're give out. We can't cover all of Orange Lake
in this wind, just paddlin'."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he's drowned?"</p>

<p>"We're gettin' feered of it."</p>

<p>"How long has he been gone?"</p>

<p>"He was seen last on Wednesday evenin', mighty drunk. Not
fitten to fish his traps. But he must of set out to fish 'em, for
his boat's not there."</p>

<p>"Well, if there's anything I can do, let me know."</p>

<p>"We'll cover the lake with the kicker, then if we have to,
we'll portion out the lake and cover it closer. A boat can lodge
up against a tussock and you not see it for the marsh grass. The
tussocks move around so bad, too."</p>

<p>The next day Snow returned the motor.</p>

<p>"Did you find Mr. Tubble?"</p>

<p>He was plainly disgusted.</p>

<p>"We found him."</p>

<p>"Alive?"</p>

<p>"No more than half."</p>

<p>"Where did you find him?"</p>

<p>"We never did. He come in Saturday night and asked what day of
the week 'twas--and what week."</p>

<p>"Where had he been all that time?"</p>

<p>"In a tussock."</p>

<p>"In a tussock? On one of those floating islands? Since
Wednesday?"</p>

<p>"Since Wednesday. He'd drawed up his boat beside him and laid
down with a gallon jug beside him."</p>

<p>"How did he ever manage to get back?"</p>

<p>"Come a rain Saturday night and fell on him and sobered him
up."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>Snow said, "It's his business, gettin' drunk, but he'd ought
to had more consideration for his friends. I paddled past that
tussock a dozen times. Now tell me, if you aimed to pitch a long
drunk, would you pick out a floatin' tussock to do it in?"</p>

<p>George Fairbanks has both Snow and Old Boss to look out for
him, and they do the job with mingled irritation and affection.
Yet George somehow needs as little looking out for as any of us
and has proved his ability to survive under conditions that would
quite finish the rest of us. He has an aloofness, a central
integrity, that is his heritage from his good blood. He is the
last of a once proud and prosperous line. The great Fairbanks
family itself has been sifted by time and circumstance until only
George is left to carry the name. He carries it in an amazing
body, bony and gangling, with no chin at all, a black mustache,
the whole dressed loosely in nondescript garments topped by an
immense black Stetson hat. The effect is a parody of the villain
in an old-fashioned melodrama. He is gentleness itself, except
when corn liquor inflames him and the Fairbanks blood runs hot,
and stuttering, he tells any man on earth what he thinks of
him.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, before the Big Freeze, the Fairbanks family
owned section on section of the best land in the county. Theirs
were the finest stretches of hammock, needing only a few hundred
dollars' worth of labor to clear into the choicest citrus land in
the state. The fine grove in Big Hammock, where lie my choice
money-making seven acres, is still known as the Fairbanks grove.
It was Major Fairbanks, of whom I have spoken, owner of my
hand-carved pine bed, who was the greatest of George's line. I
feel that I should offer George the pine bed, but since every
house he lives in eventually burns down, it seems safer with
me.</p>

<p>At one time George had a half-blind horse, a parlor organ, a
modest income from the Fairbanks estate, administered for him by
Old Boss, and the whole of a house. The house was a derelict,
too, of gray weathered pine, but it had been a good house in its
day, it had two stories, a chimney and a shingled roof that
leaked no more than was to be expected after fifty years of
Florida sun and rain. George entertained lavishly in those days,
the entertainment consisting largely of corn liquor, the guests a
queer assortment, mostly crudely painted women who were after
George's "wealth." One of them managed to marry him and when she
found that his worldly goods were not only extremely modest but
were tightly in the wise hands of Old Boss, the fur flew. He
could not accept his betrayal. He came regularly once a week to
tell me his grievous story. I have wondered if he hoped I might
know a formula for handling a harridan. He is what we call
tie-tongued and I strained my attention to understand his morose
tale. The phonetics of the cleft palate cannot be intelligibly
reproduced.</p>

<p>"I do' see how a woman tin hol' so much meanness," he
lamented. "S'e wake up mean, s'e go thu the day mean, s'e go to
s'eep mean. S'e thwow things a' me. S'e tuss me. Any man in the
tounty but me tin s'eep wi' her."</p>

<p>I think he got an advance from Old Boss with which to buy her
off. At any rate, he got rid of her, and soon afterward the horse
died, the house burned to the ground, parlor organ and all,
leaving only the fine brick chimney standing bleakly, and Old
Boss was obliged to withhold cash income from him, providing
instead the clothes and groceries he would not buy for himself as
long as liquor might be bought instead. He was not discouraged.
He moved into a shed left unburned near the chimney and began to
look for another and a more agreeable wife. He made tentative
overtures to me.</p>

<p>"I been thinkin'," he said. "I dot a Victwola an' twenty-five
wecords. Here you are, livin' alone. There I am, livin' alone. I
bwing my Victwola an' my twenty-five wecords an' I play for
you."</p>

<p>I pled too great a business to listen to twenty-five Victrola
records and contrived to discourage him. He was soon safely off
on another tack. He courted a widow's daughter somewhere in the
woods and stopped by one day to tell me that he was on his way to
resolve the issue. It did me good to see the old Fairbanks pride
and arrogance blaze brightly in him.</p>

<p>"I goin' to det her told," he said haughtily. "S'e tan't fool
aroun' wi' me. I goin' tell her, if s'e want me, s'e gotta take
me wight now. If s'e don't want me, there's plenty more rarin'
for me!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mr. Swilley, unlike George, was infinitely humble. Yet in his
grotesque way he too had his integrity. We frightened each other
almost out of our wits the first time we met. I went out to the
barn one morning, and so close to the threshold that I very
nearly tripped on him, sat Mr. Swilley. I not only did not know
that he was Mr. Swilley, I did not know that such a person
existed, or had come to reside in our neighborhood. He looked
like a cross between an Indian and one of those travelling quacks
known as medicine men. He had dark cavernous eyes, high
cheekbones and lank black hair that hung to his shoulders. I
found later that he cut his own hair and was dependent for even
this rudimentary barbering on the loan of some one's scissors. I
jumped back with a startled cry and Mr. Swilley frightened me
still further by going apparently into a convulsion. He jerked
all over, his head swung from side to side, his arms shot forward
spasmodically, his feet flew in my direction, and all the while
he let out pained and explosive grunts, "Uh, uh, uh, uh." I had
terrified him more than he had me. I learned in time to make some
preliminary noise whenever I approached him, preferably some
natural woods noise such as the breaking a stick, for if I called
or spoke or came unexpectedly within his vision, he cried out in
that grunting pain and jerked like a monkey on a stick. He lived
most of the time, I think, in a trance, and I have wondered from
what strange and lovely world I brought him unhappily back to
life.</p>

<p>He was in my barn that first morning, a cold one, waiting for
Snow to come to work, in the hope that the truck would be going
to the village and he could get a ride. The truck did happen to
be going to town and Mr. Swilley rode in and out on it. Snow came
to me with his brown eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>"Don't be surprised at anything," he said. "Mr. Swilley had a
dream."</p>

<p>The whole business of Mr. Swilley seemed in the nature of a
nightmare, and now Snow was participating.</p>

<p>"Mr. Swilley dreamed," Snow continued, "that his dead mother
came to him and told him his troubles were over. 'You got nothin'
more to worry about, son,' she told him. 'You'll have a good roof
over your head, good clothes to wear, a car to ride in and plenty
to eat. The week'll not be out before you meet a rich
widow.'"</p>

<p>I had never seen the silent Snow so close to laughter.</p>

<p>"I just thought I'd warn you," he said. "I'm mighty afraid
you're the rich widow."</p>

<p>It is unkind to slap a ghost in the face, but I called to Mr.
Swilley's dead mother and thanked her to mind her own business.
Mr. Swilley came daily to ask for work, though we had none, and
for fear that on the strength of supernatural backing he would
also ask at once for my hand, I dealt with him through Snow. Snow
hinted that the man was starving, so we put him to work as a
hoe-hand. He was plainly dejected. Ghosts take a great
responsibility when they encourage mortals. Mr. Swilley must have
clung to hope, for he made excuses to speak to me. Once he asked
me to do an errand for him and brought a handful of silver from
his overalls pocket. The nickels and dimes that he handed me were
strangely smooth and bright, the design almost obliterated by a
tinny covering.</p>

<p>I said, "What on earth is on this money, Mr. Swilley?"</p>

<p>He fidgeted and jerked and stammered.</p>

<p>"Uh--uh--you know--it's quicksilver--for bedbugs."</p>

<p>I wondered how the mercury controlled bedbugs and whether he
used it on his dead mother's recommendation but I did not press
the point.</p>

<p>At Christmas time I thought of the man's baggy clothes, his
still uncut hair, his quicksilver and his dejection, and made up
a box for him; a cooked ham, a fruit cake, pecans and candy. I
wanted to put in shirts and socks and a sweater, as for Snow, but
I feared these personal items might invoke again the shade of his
hope-bringing parent. Snow had told me that Mr. Swilley was
living on the old Turner place. I knew the Turner house had
burned, at a time when George was occupying it, and I had
wondered vaguely how Mr. Swilley had been able to build for
himself. I made my rounds on Christmas morning and turned with
the last box down the magnolia-lined lane that led to the Turner
place. The gate had been ingeniously mended with wire, the only
sign that the land was used by any one but hunters. For a moment
I thought that Snow must be mistaken. There was no possible human
habitation in sight. I fastened the gate behind me and went on
foot toward the scrawny orange and camphor trees that had once
shaded the Turner house. Under the camphor tree was a tin box.
True, it was almost as tall as a short man, and about six feet by
six, but surely the Townsend boys must have thrown it together
for the purpose of playing pirates or G-men. Then I remembered
that the Townsend boys did not build things, and certainly would
engage in no game as strenuous as pirates or G-men. The box was
made of sheets of corrugated tin roofing that had survived the
fire. I walked around it. One sheet of tin had been nailed to the
adjacent sheet with hinges made of old harness leather. Opposite
the hinges was a new lock. This, then, was a door. I walked
around the corner and a square of about twelve inches had been
cut in the side. This was a window. I poked my head inside the
square. I had found Mr. Swilley's home.</p>

<p>It was as dark as a cave. It made Snow's palmetto shack seem
as comfortable as a city apartment. One by one I identified the
objects that made up the household equipment. A bunk of rough
saplings filled one wall. It was covered with pine boughs. The
bedding consisted of a ragged patchwork quilt, the work, I
gathered, of Mr. Swilley's mother. From the look of the quilt,
she had been dead a long time. There was no chair. There was no
room for a chair. The near side of the box was filled with a
stove that Robinson Crusoe would have considered beyond the pale.
It consisted of a rusty piece of sheet iron. Under it ran a
length of old stovepipe and fire still smouldered in this. There
was one battered pot on the stove. It held a few spoonfuls of
lumpy grits. There may have been supplies under the stovepipe but
there were none in sight. There were no clothes hanging on the
wall, for the only clothes Mr. Swilley owned were on his stooped
back, wherever it might be. I could no longer begrudge him the
dreams his mother brought him. I pushed my box in the window and
went away.</p>

<p>When he came the next day to hoe, he said, "I'm sorry I wasn't
to home when you called. I knowed it was you. I got a little
somethin' for you, too."</p>

<p>His gift was a ladder of a length he knew I needed. The sides
were of peeled cypress saplings. The rungs were hand-carved from
straight hickory limbs, set in solidly with wooden pegs. It was a
good ladder and it made my box seem very trifling indeed. I
suppose he took encouragement from the exchange. Dreams die hard,
and perhaps as he huddled on his pine boughs under his ragged
quilt his mother came to him again to tell him to keep heart. For
he began to prance. When I spoke to him, if I managed to attract
his attention without startling him into the jerks, he jumped
from whatever he was doing and pranced toward me like an old and
decrepit goat. I never saw him negotiate six yards without
tripping.</p>

<p>It is still a marvel to me that he did not break his neck the
time I took him with me to bring colored Mary's belongings to the
Creek. The whole expedition, including Mary, was a mistake. The
confidence I showed in Mr. Swilley in entrusting him with the
mission was all he needed to assure him that the solution of his
life was at hand. I had engaged Mary as a maid, knowing nothing
of her but that she was neat, well-spoken, of good honest Negro
farming stock near Fairfield, and that she assured me that the
lonely job I offered was all she asked of Heaven. Her bed, trunk
and boxes that she asked to bring could not be carried in my car.
Snow was behind with the tractoring and I asked Mr. Swilley to
follow me in the truck to bring home Mary and her worldly
goods.</p>

<p>He had assured me that he was a finished driver and mechanic.
I believe that this was the first time he had ever driven a car.
The truck was in good running order, but I noticed that he called
Snow from the field to start it for him. I had the sudden wisdom
to tell him that I should drive slowly ahead, and to blow the
horn if he had trouble. Four times on curves or at cross-roads
the horn sounded desperately and I stopped and went back to find
the truck stalled. I started it for him and we reached's Mary's
home in the backwoods. She pointed out the things that were to go
and said she would call her brother to help. Mr. Swilley
protested that for a man of his strength, handling them alone was
nothing. He came out first with a heavy old walnut bed which he
said it was not necessary to dismantle. He carried it by the
headboard, the whole sticking out in front of him as though he
meant to use it as a mammoth trap for a bear. I was horrified to
see him ignore the wide gate and leap, bed and all, over the
fence. The bed crashed down ahead of him, Mary let out a shriek
that was to become familiar, and Mr. Swilley picked himself up
and flung the bed bodily into the back of the truck. He dusted
his hands, flushed with pride, and hurdled the fence back to the
house.</p>

<p>I called, "The trunk will go through the gate, Mr.
Swilley."</p>

<p>He beamed and waggled his head, poised the heavy trunk
jauntily on one shoulder, and again attacked the fence. His
intention was not only to jump it, but to soar lightly over it.
Mr. Swilley missed soaring by half the height of the fence. One
leg cleared it in a blithe arc, the other caught midway, the
trunk bounced to earth and flew open, Mary screamed, and Mr.
Swilley hung dangling, an almost inextricable part of the fence.
He unwove himself, staggered to the trunk, helped Mary to heap
things back in it, sat on the lid, fastened it, and heaved it
into the truck. He smiled happily and returned for the collection
of boxes. Only a little cautious, he took the fence from a
standing jump, picked up himself and the boxes from the ground,
and we were ready to set out for home. He managed to start the
truck this time, and I had gone perhaps half a mile over the
winding woods road when I realized that he was not behind me. The
road was too narrow and curved for backing or turning around and
I went back on foot to where the truck stood motionless with a
great roaring of the engine.</p>

<p>"Seems to be stuck," Mr. Swilley panted, and leaped from the
seat and threw himself prone to examine nonexistent
obstacles.</p>

<p>The truck was not stuck. He had managed to throw it out of
gear and had sat racing an impotent engine. The truth came to me
now but it was too late. Dusk was falling and we had to get home.
I was reminded of the nursery story of the fire that had to burn
the stick, so that the stick would beat the pig, so that the pig
would jump over the stile, "or we won't get home before morning."
I gave Mr. Swilley a belated and elemental lesson in
gear-shifting and we were on our way again. He got along nicely
for a few miles and hope and success went to his head. In a great
burst of speed, he passed me, and the rest of the trip was a
nightmare. Mr. Swilley swooped and swerved ahead of me, as though
he were trying to take the truck itself over fences. I dared not
pass him, for fear he should think it was a coy game. He took
curves on two wheels, dogs and pigs and chickens and other cars
fled out of his way, and by a miracle he brought the truck in to
the home grounds and to rest against the side of the barn.</p>

<p>"We went through some beautiful country," he said.</p>

<p>I was glad he had enjoyed the scenery, for I had seen none.
Perhaps his dead mother had told him that the proper approach was
the &aelig;sthetic one.</p>

<p>I lived through the rest of Mr. Swilley and Mary together.
They were sad, strange, violent days, and I would not live them
again for the wealth of India. Mary began promisingly, keeping my
house as clean as a laboratory. Martha brought me the first word
that all was not well.</p>

<p>"Sugar," she said, "I think you'd ought to know. Mary comes
down to my house almost every day and tells me she's starvin' to
death. Says you don't give her a thing to eat. Says she has to
walk to town and buy herself a little somethin' with her own
money."</p>

<p>I was horrified.</p>

<p>I said, "Why, I give her exactly what I have myself. I buy
enough of everything for both of us, and I thought I made it
clear that she was to help herself."</p>

<p>"You don't need to tell me, Sugar. I knows your kitchen and I
knows your ways. I just figgered you'd ought to know."</p>

<p>It occurred to me that perhaps my steaks and chops and
asparagus and lettuce were not to the taste of a country woman.
Perhaps Mary longed for cornpone and cowpeas and white bacon.</p>

<p>I said to her, "Mary, if you don't like what I happen to have
to eat, help yourself at any time to cornmeal and bacon and
things like that, and fix whatever you want for yourself."</p>

<p>She looked at me with cold glittering eyes and made no answer.
A few days later she began shouting. She was at the washtubs and
a wave of angry shrieks came to me, as though she were driving
off an assailant. I ran to the back and she stopped instantly,
bending low over the tub.</p>

<p>"Mary, what's the matter? Why were you screaming?"</p>

<p>She looked up innocently.</p>

<p>"I never opened my mouth," she said, and dipped a sheet up and
down in the water.</p>

<p>The shouting began to have a rhythmic pattern. It came
regularly every six days. Once I awakened in the early morning
grayness and heard her in the kitchen. She seemed to be throwing
pots and pans about the kitchen, shouting as she threw. The
shouts lifted to the familiar shriek. I looked at my watch. It
was five o'clock. Suddenly the sound ended and she was gone. At
the usual hour of seven o'clock she was back in the kitchen. She
brought me my coffee quietly. I could not believe that the quiet
woman serving me capably was the one I had heard before
daylight.</p>

<p>One night I told her that I must have coffee early the next
morning, at six-thirty instead of seven-thirty. I must leave
promptly at seven to drive to Jacksonville where I was meeting a
party at nine, I said, to go on a trek to Fort George Island. I
set the alarm clock and gave it to her. I awakened in the morning
with the uneasy sense of lateness. It was a quarter of eight. The
kitchen was silent. A light rain beat on the shingled roof. I
dashed to the kitchen and put on the coffee pot and returned to
my room to dress. I could not now possibly reach Jacksonville in
time, and since the party was large, it could not wait for me,
and I must drive to the village and telephone that I could not
join them. As I poured a cup of coffee, at a quarter past eight,
Mary sauntered in.</p>

<p>I said, "Didn't your alarm go off? Did you oversleep?"</p>

<p>She said jauntily, "Oh, the alarm went off all right. I was up
at daylight. But it was raining, and I didn't care to get
wet."</p>

<p>I said, "You could have thrown a quilt around you. You had all
day to change your clothes."</p>

<p>I turned and looked into her eyes and knew instantly what I
should have known before, that she was as mad as a March
hare.</p>

<p>Bits of her history had seeped out in her outbursts. She had
mentioned a northern hospital where, she said, she had worked. I
asked my doctor to investigate. Word came back that she had
indeed been at the hospital, not as an employee, but as a patient
in the insane ward. She had a long record as a manic-depressive.
She had had a quiet spell, and while attention was relaxed, she
had escaped, back to Florida.</p>

<p>My doctor said, "You can't get rid of her fast enough. With
that type of insanity, you're likely to wake up one morning and
find her standing over you, with a maniac's strength, with an
axe."</p>

<p>She had driven me almost as insane as herself, but in her
quiet periods she was sweet and gentle and infinitely pathetic.
She needed a minor operation, and it seemed to me that her mental
illness might possibly be traced to the physical one. I took her
to the hospital, paid for the operation, nursed her at home
afterward, and she was patient and grateful. She was entirely
recovered and there had been no shouting. She asked to spend a
week end at her father's farm. I took her there and told her I
should call for her at Fairfield, at the store, about ten-thirty
Sunday night.</p>

<p>"I may be a little earlier than ten-thirty," I said, "or a
little later. If I'm early, I'll wait for you, and if I'm late,
you wait for me."</p>

<p>At ten-thirty-five Sunday night I was at the store. There was
no Mary. The village was dark. I waited until eleven-thirty and
drove home. On Wednesday there came a note in Mary's very good
handwriting.</p>

<p>"I came to the store at ten-thirty," she wrote, "and you were
not there. The weather was inclement so I returned to my father's
house. You may come for me."</p>

<p>I wrote, "Dear Mary: I shall not come at all."</p>

<p>With Martha tiding me over until I should find some one else,
I realized that I had been living in the heart of an electrical
storm. My ragged nerves eased their tension and peace filled the
Creek beneficently. A year ago Martha went to Fairfield for the
bean-picking.</p>

<p>"Mary was pickin' beans with us," she reported. "She sent her
love to you."</p>

<p>My last days with Mary ran concurrently with my last days with
Mr. Swilley. Together they were part of a dark tortured
unreality. After the expedition to bring her belongings, he took
to sitting in the yard after his work was done. Two or three
times I asked if he were expecting a ride, or needed
something.</p>

<p>"I'm just waitin'," he said.</p>

<p>Between Mary's shrieks and Mr. Swilley's waiting, I was in a
fair way to become a psychopathic case myself. I longed to send
him packing, but there was no other work at the Creek, and I
could not endure to think of the tin box without even a pot of
grits boiling over the stovepipe. All I could do was to provide
hoeing and to ignore the long-haired derelict who squatted under
the orange trees. One day he was blessedly gone and did not
appear again. Snow brought me good news of him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Swilley found his widow," he said. "I reckon she was
rich, like his mother promised, for they live in a right good
cabin by the edge of a little stream and I see an old car setting
out in front."</p>

<p>I can only hope that the widow keeps control of the car. I
dare not conjecture, if Mr. Swilley is the answer to her dream,
her own mentality and appearance.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Bernie Bass family is prospering. They can now afford to
buy milk for the children. It makes me feel as good as when I
have a stroke of luck of my own. As long as Bernie has a job, the
somehow terrible matter of the dime cannot arise again. When my
cow Dora and Lady, the heifer, came fresh at the same time, I
sent out word to the Creek that any family with children could
have skimmed milk without charge. Any one who wished to pay might
have it at the rate of three quarts for ten cents. The milk was
skimmed after only eight hours in the ice box and was even then
as rich as city milk. I had the Raney family and the Basses in
mind. The Raneys were too lazy or too shy ever to send and the
Basses did not, I am sure, for pride. They could not pay and they
would not accept the milk without it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernie Bass came lately to arrange for milk, two of the
boys stubbing bare toes behind her. She untied a fifty-cent piece
from a handkerchief and paid, with an immense satisfaction, in
advance.</p>

<p>"A dime of that," she said, "is what I owed you a'ready. I
reckon you don't even remember. Near about a year ago, I come to
you to carry a dime for the little one's lunch. But I hadn't
forgotten."</p>

<p>I had not forgotten, either.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernie Bass is a small thin woman. She flutters like a
nervous mother bird. The first time I met her, after the Basses
had moved into the tenant house in Cow Hammock, she came running,
calling out in the panic that I associate with her. The woods
fire that had been smouldering around us for days had fanned into
fresh flame and was closing in on her house. She was alone and
needed help.</p>

<p>"I been fightin' and frammin' 'til I'm wore out. I hate to see
the house go for lack of help."</p>

<p>I called the men from the grove and we all pitched in and
fought fire. It is hard and evil work. A shift of wind helped us
save the clearing.</p>

<p>Long later, when the woman called from my gate about the dime,
her voice held the same distress as when the fire menaced.</p>

<p>"I do hate to worry you," she said, and brushed her hair back
from her forehead. "I know you'll do it, but I shore hate to ask.
It's the little one. Bernie ain't had no work for the longest. He
didn't have no dime to give him today for his school lunch. I
just found out he went off on the school bus without no dime. He
gets two of them nickel packages of raisin buns for his lunch.
Seems like they fill him up better than anything else he can get.
It's a heap to ask, but could you drive in to the school and give
him a dime? I'll pay you back just as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"Of course. I'll go right away."</p>

<p>"It's a heap to ask, but I just had to."</p>

<p>A day without food is a trifle to the adult Basses.</p>

<p>"He ain't but seven," she apologized. "He's so little to go
all day without his rations."</p>

<p>The repayment of the dime a year later was a triumph. The
putting down of money in advance for milk, when it could have
been received free, was the winning of a major battle. When one
has a basic integrity, one's standards are high. A dime becomes a
banner.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Grampa Hicks lived in a palmetto-log shack at the edge of
Cross Creek. His brown old face was beardless. He wore one blue
mail-order shirt, "Chieftain" brand--loyalty forbade his buying
the cheaper "Big Yank"--and one pair of blue pin-check pants
until they dropped from his unlaundered body. He lived, slept and
fished in them. He was also loyal to "Three Thistles" snuff. He
considered "Railroad" fitten only for niggers and "Buttercup" for
women.</p>

<p>He existed by the illegal trapping of fish in Orange Lake and
by renting other men's rowboats, without permission, to fishermen
from Jacksonville. If a customer's outboard motor lacked gas, he
shuffled mysteriously to the other side of the bridge across the
Creek, where lay beached other boats and motors, and returned
with fuel. If a stranger to these parts needed liquor, so that
when the fish didn't bite he could spit on his hook, cuss and
take a drink to get them started, Grampa went into the underbrush
beyond his shack, returning with a catsup bottle of 'shine. If
catfish were scarce on his own lines, he ran the other
fellow's.</p>

<p>Man's law is one thing, God's another.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning we asked Grampa to go fishing with us. He
knew where the bream were biting and we had had no luck for
weeks. He spat.</p>

<p>"I don't fish on Sundays," he said haughtily. "I wa'n't raised
up that-a-way."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mister Marsh Turner might have been called a vagabond, but
never a derelict. I shall always be sorry that the high sheriff
did not know what I knew about him. The law called him
troublesome, and certainly his ways and his live stock did not
make for peace in the environs. But I think of him still as a man
peaceable at heart, and definitely a gentleman. The Negroes, who
are infallible snobs, recognized the mark of high caste that
illuminated his drunkenness and his violence and spoke of him
always as Mister Marsh Turner.</p>

<p>He lived across the Creek on the old Turner place with his
elderly mother. Why the decaying house did not fall down around
their ears, especially when he was in a mood to hurl furniture
through the windows, I do not know. He owned considerable numbers
of hogs and cattle. They roamed at will over the woods, our
county being open range, and crossed the bridge and intruded on
our side of the Creek. We are accustomed to ordinary pigs and
cows that root and browse harmlessly. But Mister Marsh Turner's
stock seemed to share his lawlessness. The hogs were of the large
razor-back variety and fought the Creek dogs at sight. No fence
could resist their attacks. They went through them, over them or
under them. Once in my house yard, they broke into the feed room
of the barn and turned over feed barrels with a din like thunder.
They devoured young and unwary chickens in their stride. The
Turner cattle were almost as bad. They were led by a big bony
range bull who once went so far as to gather my two milch cows
into his harem and to refuse to allow them to enter my lot for
the evening milking.</p>

<p>I had heard tall tales of the Turner doings but I had never
seen him. Almost every Monday morning Martha had a racy account
of his Saturday night drunk. He was as addicted to music as to
liquor and thought nothing of walking uninvited into a frolic and
taking the fiddle away from the fiddler and playing his own tune,
independent of the rest of the music. One Saturday night he
played the guitar all night on the courthouse steps in
Gainesville, where a sleepy sheriff took him over at dawn, still
picking the strings. Jail was almost his week-end home. He paid
his fine amiably on Monday morning, went home, got drunk again,
and becoming enraged, took out his fury by throwing whatever he
could lift inside the house or out. It was all harmless enough
and Mother Turner did not seem to mind. When his activities had
spent themselves and he had slept it off, he arose quickly, ate
heartily and set about making new table and chair legs to replace
the broken ones. I got these reports from Martha.</p>

<p>"Whatever Mister Marsh Turner do wrong," she said proudly, "he
set in and make right."</p>

<p>One morning I reached the limit of my patience with his stock.
The bull crashed a new gate, the Turner cows and heifers and
yearlings followed, and I awoke to a veritable stampede around
and around my bedroom. I sent word to Martha to tell him, when
next he brought the Turner washing to her, that something must be
done and if necessary I would do it. The law gave a property
owner certain rights against true outlaw stock and if the law
proved indifferent, I should not continue so.</p>

<p>The next day a bay horse trotted smartly to my gate and a long
graceful figure wavered in the saddle, then dismounted and swayed
up my path. It was indubitably Mister Marsh Turner and he was
unbelievably drunk. I had a moment of panic in which I could
picture him lassoing me and mounting me on the back of the
offending bull, for I knew his imagination was as vivid as mine.
I went to the door and called "Good morning," politely. He
continued his zig-zag course up the path. When he reached my
steps, he took off his broad-brimmed black Stetson with a
flourish, swept it across his breast, and bowed almost to the
ground.</p>

<p>"I am Marsh Turner, callin'," he said.</p>

<p>"Your stock," I began.</p>

<p>He held up one hand to stop me.</p>

<p>"I been told," he said, "I been told my stock has been
a-botherin' of you. The next time them cattle and them hogs comes
over here a-botherin' of you--" he bowed deeply and unsteadily
again--"them's your cattle." He put one hand on his heart.
"Them's your hogs."</p>

<p>He turned with dignity and swayed down the path, out of the
gate, closing it carefully behind him as a countryman should do,
and managed to mount the bay. I never saw him again.</p>

<p>I was distressed when his gentility, however violent, was
removed from our terrain. He gave an air to the Creek that is
gone with him. None of us is so dramatic, so picturesque, or
drinks with such originality. I do not know the truth about
Mister Marsh Turner's death. I have heard several versions. The
one I choose to believe may be apocryphal. It is certainly,
though spectacular, the most plausible. Mister Marsh Turner had
tried the sheriff's patience for a long time. As the story goes,
on the previous Saturday Marsh had taken his hurling proclivities
when inebriated into the house of a total stranger. When he
finished throwing things, he shot holes through the north wall of
the house. No householder relishes the idea of a tall, dark,
handsome, drunken intruder's stalking into his home and pitching
the furniture out of the window. A shot-up wall is of course
insult added to injury. He could not be expected to know that the
stranger's habit was to make full restitution. A warrant for
Mister Marsh Turner's arrest was, to say the least, in order.</p>

<p>The sheriff went to the Turner homestead to serve it. He found
Marsh leaning against the doorway, oiling his shotgun. Marsh
turned with no surprise. The gun was at an ominous angle in his
hands.</p>

<p>The sheriff called, "Put down that gun."</p>

<p>Marsh took a step toward him and said quietly, "Sheriff, this
here gun is for you."</p>

<p>The sheriff shot and Marsh fell and it was the end of glamor
at Cross Creek. If the tale be true, I am the only person who
knows that when Marsh spoke, it was without menace. He was
offering the sheriff the offending gun exactly as he had once
offered me his trespassing hogs and cattle.</p>

<h2><a name="c14">14. <i>Toady-frogs, lizards, antses, and
varmints</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I do not profess to know all there is to know about frogs,
lizards, ants and varmints. I have learned enough, however, in
years of enforced intimacy, to turn them from aliens into
friends, or at least into bowing acquaintances. I should have
been prepared to like frogs. One who has heard a northern spring
come in on that silver chorus should make decent obeisance to the
singers and all their related family. The frog Philharmonic of
the Florida lakes and marshes is unendurable in its sweetness. I
have lain through a long moonlit night, with the scent of orange
blossoms palpable as spilled perfume on the air, and listened to
the murmur of minor chords until, just as I have wept over the
Brahms waltz in A flat on a master's violin, I thought my heart
would break with the beauty of it. If there is not a finished
tune, there are phrases, and there is assuredly a motif,
articulated, reiterated. I searched long in my mental attic
before I remembered where I had heard the sound before. It is the
high thin jangle of Chinese music, overlaid with the pattern of
glass wind-chimes, such as Alvah had given me for Christmas.</p>

<p>If frogs an inch long have never been carved in apple-green
jade, they should be. Nothing else could repeat the jewel-like
perfection of this diminutive species. Their eyes are tiny
moonstones. I am sure of this, for I just stepped off the veranda
and turned back a spider-lily leaf to look at one and make
certain. They are also as soft and smooth as satin. I know this,
too, for the variety is the one that clings to the wetness of the
shower-bath pipe and drops on my skin.</p>

<p>They appear in June, full-fledged, and do not seem to change
their size all summer. Martha calls them the rain-frogs. They are
inch-long, animated pieces of pale green enamel. Self-conscious
jewels, they seem to choose their setting. I find them until the
first frost on the pleasanter side of a lily leaf. Spider lily
leaves are preferred, being roomier, but a large Amaryllis will
do. At night, or when the sun is not too fierce, they lie in the
inner trough of the thick spiked leaves. When the sun is high, or
when the rain comes down tempestuously, they cling with tiny
cream-jade vacuumed feet to the under side of a leaf. They roll
their moonstone eyes. They quiver slightly if their perch is
shaken. They move only when actually dispossessed, taking off in
a long leap that is almost a flight.</p>

<p>They are a celestial breed of frogs and in season are found in
apartments suitable to reincarnated Chinese emperors--large
yellow allamanda blossoms. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, two
inches deep. The chosen few among the frogs lie all day in these
deep golden caves, contemptuous of a less luxurious world. I have
no doubt that prevailing winds blow in their breakfasts and their
teas of insects. There is an uncanny resemblance between the
frogs and the buds of the allamanda. Until they open, the buds
are precisely the size and shape of the frogs. Until well along
into yellow prematurity, they are even the same shade of green.
They have the same snub nose, the same little bulges of two eyes.
It is easy to imagine that the more royal frogs are born in the
allamanda blossoms, giving the buds their shape. It seems as
though there must be a mystic affinity between the flower and its
inhabitant. If I were a theosophist, I should certainly revere
the tiny frogs as the living shape of Chinese aristocrats, who,
even in an enforced humility of form, maintain an archaic
arrogance. It would surely, I decided, be l&ecirc;se
majest&eacute; to scream at one in the shower bath.</p>

<p>The Widow Slater, however, always screamed at them.</p>

<p>"I'm as skeert of a toady-frog as of a snake," she said. "I
don't want a thing to do with anything can swaller fire and
shot."</p>

<p>Some connotation from Elizabethan witch days still clings in
these Anglo-saxon parts to a frog or toad. "Eye of newt and toe
of frog" in the litany of Macbeth's witches has its counterpart
here. It is not the only trace of Old English in the Florida
interior, for the backwoods people come of a line that stems back
to Chaucer. The fire-swallowing of the Widow Slater's complaint I
cannot vouch for, but I have it on reliable authority that a toad
will swallow buckshot until he can hold no more. The legend is
old in American folklore, for Mark Twain used it in his famous
story, "The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County." Fred Tompkins and
my friend Moe testified to holding a toad hypnotized with a light
and slowly rolling the small lead pellets toward him on the
ground. He scooped them in solemnly, they said, until his paunch
protruded like an alderman's. When released from the spell of the
light, he hopped an inch at a time with the heavy thud of a
coin-filled purse. Whether a toad believes the balls of lead to
be some new delicacy, or whether his appetite is an indication of
his ancient witchery, I cannot say. I can only hope that the
experimenters were humane enough to do as in Twain's story, and
turn the surfeited creature upside down until he was relieved of
his indigestible burden.</p>

<p>Although the Negro and the backwoodsman call the toad a
hoppy-toad and the frog a toady-frog, they make the common
distinction between a frog and a toad.</p>

<p>The large edible frogs of lake and marsh have been a boon to
the otherwise unemployed of Creek and village.</p>

<p>My profane friend Zelma, the census taker, said, "The b--s
killed the egrets for their plumage until the egrets gave out.
They killed alligators for their hides until the alligators gave
out. If the frogs ever give out, the sons of b--s will starve to
death."</p>

<p>The frogs show no signs of giving out, for even the
improvident and needy do not take the small ones, so that there
is always a new crop coming on. When you order frog-legs in a
Northern restaurant or hotel, there is a good chance that you are
served frog-legs from Orange Lake and the Creek marshes. The
hunters are paid a high price for them, for the Boyt brothers of
Citra get seventy cents a pound wholesale, as middlemen, and I
must pay fifty cents for the dressed legs. On a dark night,
Orange Lake seems to be dotted with will-o'-the-wisps, and these
are the lights of the frog hunters.</p>

<p>Fred Tompkins took me frog hunting one shadowy night up the
winding channels of the Creek. Later in our friendship, I should
have known that he was up to mischief. Fred is Puck incarnate, in
spite of being a Spanish war veteran, a deputy sheriff, and the
constable at Citra. He paddled our boat Indian-soft along the
reed-filled shore, in and out of coves choked with coontail and
water lilies. I lay in the bow, according to his instructions,
playing a flashlight on the lily pads. Sometimes the bright eyes
of water spiders caught the light and deceived me. When the light
picked out the hypnotized eyes of a frog, they gleamed like two
drops of dew. Fred paddled close.</p>

<p>"Now just reach out and get him," he said.</p>

<p>I reached out a cautious hand. At the moment of what seemed
certain capture, the frog straightened out his legs like a
jack-knife unfolding and was gone. We repeated this aggravating
procedure for two hours.</p>

<p>At last, I said, "You just can't catch them this way."</p>

<p>Fred said, "Me and the Boyts gets 'em."</p>

<p>I turned and flashed the light in his face. His eyes were two
brown pools of laughter.</p>

<p>"There's something you aren't telling me," I said.</p>

<p>He slapped his knee and could hold his delight no longer.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you 'twas the light holds 'em? What happens to
the light when you reach for 'em?"</p>

<p>"Let me try again."</p>

<p>What happened to the light was that when I reached for the
frog, my hand threw a shadow and the spell was broken. By
reaching slowly to the side and then behind the frog, capture was
as simple as though the frog were asleep.</p>

<p>I said, a little irritated, "Now we'd have had lots of frogs,
if you'd told me. This was foolish."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, and chuckled, "no fool, no fun."</p>

<p>Now that my lesson was learned, the moon had rolled day-bright
from behind the clouds, silvering the water and the shaggy-headed
palms on the horizon, and the flashlight was useless in the
brilliance. We came home with two frogs. Skinning them was
embarrassing. Peeling back the green glovelike skin from the
white flesh of the legs is like pulling off a small boy's
breeches. When they came to table, they affected me as alligator
steak does Fred, but for another reason.</p>

<p>"The longer you chaw," he says, "the bigger it gets."</p>

<p>For when I thought of the frog chorus, and wondered if I had
ever listened to these two particular voices, I felt as though I
had just had a hearty meal on Kirsten Flagstad and Nino
Martini.</p>

<p>I find lizards altogether ingratiating. The red-runner lizards
are the least attractive, in spite of their shining red and brown
and orange, for they are the most snakelike of the lizards. They
run to body and tail, with very little visible leg. They are shy,
and slither out of sight in a flash. The Negroes and many of the
whites believe them to be poisonous, but this is rural
fiction.</p>

<p>The small gray lizards have a catholic taste in dwelling
places. Every abandoned house is full of them; they live in the
woods; they live comfortably in your home with you, wondering
what you are doing there, but tolerant on the whole of your
intrusion. They are the color of old cypress shingles, with
bellies of rich cobalt blue, and there is nothing more impudent
unless it is a mocking bird. They are one of the few creatures
who really look at a human being, returning stare for stare. They
roll their many-faceted eyes and cock their heads, and I do not
think it is my imagination that they feel complete contempt for
the human race. One sat so long beside me on the veranda steps,
looking me up and down with an icy loathing, that I took a small
stick and began to tap him lightly on his tail. He was at first
more curious than annoyed, as though this were a new puzzle in
human behavior. Suddenly he whirled and bit stormily on the
stick. Then he flicked his tail and sauntered a few feet away
with his back to me. He made it plain that he could as easily
have attacked my fingers, if he had cared to bother.</p>

<p>The little chameleons are definitely friendly. Yet they are
detached, like friends with their minds on other matters. They
are partial to a warm bed that a human has slept in and expects
to sleep in again that night. They have to be lifted from it by
the tail, which surprises you by breaking off in your fingers.
They clamber slowly, gracefully, up and down screens. They watch
you for hours with bright small eyes. They enjoy being brought
into the house on a bunch of roses, to serve on the dining table
for ornament, shading obligingly from their favorite sage-green
through taupe to a pinkish mauve, according to their passage over
leaf or stem or blossom.</p>

<p>They have amazing acrobatic tricks in their repertoire. I
watched one do a neat piece of tight-rope balancing on top of the
wire fence. Their tiny pointed feet have a suction grip, but even
so the wire seemed something of a problem. The chameleon reached
a fence post and lay there resting. I wondered why he did not
slide down the post to the more navigable ground. He knew what he
wanted and where he was going. He may have noticed a cluster of
dragonflies or a swarm of midges in the adjacent orange tree, for
he gathered his three-inch length together like a horse before a
hedge and flung himself at least two feet out and up to the tip
of an orange bough. The most ambitious chamelon I have ever seen
was swallowing a butterfly twice as wide as he himself was long,
the body almost as large as the swallower's. When I first noticed
him, he had the butterfly's head in his mouth and the wings stuck
out on either side like vast and ferocious mustaches. I stood and
laughed at him and he eyed me furiously, switching his tail. I
said, "You'll never do it," and went on about my business. An
hour later I passed by again and all the butterfly was down
except for the wing tips. As I watched, he gulped and the job was
done.</p>

<p>They live solitary and free-lance lives, meeting only to make
love or to fight. I presume the fighting is among males in
season. Among some ferns at the foot of an orange tree I saw such
a commotion, such a shaking of fronds, that a miniature
earthquake might have been in progress. Separating the ferns, I
found two chameleons locked in a death embrace. By some wizardry,
each had the other by the throat and there they meant to stay.
When I pulled them apart, they did not resume their battle, but
turned their joint fury on me. No <i>Deus ex</i> <i>machina</i>
of the human tribe they had so often contemplated with curiosity
and contempt was to be allowed to interfere in a championship
fight between chameleons. When I took my last glimpse of them,
they were glaring after me, heaving up and down on their small
stomachs, their throats inflated into enormous rose-pink bubbles.
I think this inflation of the throat must be emotional, for I see
it when I know that one is angry or amorous. I could not
guarantee that it is not also, ignominiously, a digestive
symptom, for I see it too when the chameleon is lying quietly in
a spider lily, and when I happen to know that he has been there
long enough, in the midst of abundant insect food, already to
have had his dinner. Yet I feel such confidence in the brittle
intelligence of these tiny replicas of dragons, that I have
convinced myself that even then he is, stormily, thinking.</p>

<p>Ants have played havoc with my belief that anything is
interesting when known. Having come prepared to loathe crawling
things and stayed to admire them, I came full of copybook
reverence for the ant and remain filled with the desire to
exterminate the last one. In a still predatory world, good and
evil are not fixed values, but are relative. "Good" is what helps
us or at least does not hinder. "Evil" is whatever harms us or
interferes with us, according to our own selfish standards. The
ant as a symbol of industry, of social organization, of superb
community instinct, has been extolled by science as well as the
Bible. But for whom does the ant function so industriously and so
socially? No one has troubled to point out that it is for the
ant.</p>

<p>In the tropics and the semi-tropics, the ant is a major pest.
When in the spring the orange trees put out their new growth of
tender frail leaves, overnight those leaves may curl in on
themselves into a hard twisted mass incapable forever of taking
in the nourishment of sun and earth for the growth of tree and
fruit. Examination shows the under side of the leaves a mass of
small green aphis, or plant lice, sucking the sustenance of the
leaves and so of the tree. A few of these come in on the wind
from other infected areas, but most of them are moved there, fed,
cultivated and milked, by the ants. The aphis is known as the
ant's cow, and school children are taught to be intrigued by the
conception. The analogy is no more charming than if one's
neighbor moved his herd of cattle into one's garden. In the same
fashion, the ant brings in and nourishes the cottony-cushion
scale, which can turn a thriving young grove in a few weeks into
a Dali-esque nightmare of brown sticks. Agronomists have
discovered of late years that the cottony-cushion scale has its
enemy, an imported Japanese variety of ladybug, whose sole food
is the scale. Without this one food, the Japanese lady-bug
perishes, and all through one summer I traded to the University's
citrus department boughs covered with cottony-cushion scale, in
return for Japanese ladybugs. The balance of nature is a
mysterious thing, and man must fight on one side or the other
with caution, or he will find that in his battle he has
exterminated some friendly element. Old-timers in citrus growing
do not believe in much of the spraying for unfriendly parasites,
and some of the moderns are agreeing, for in destroying them, the
friendly parasites are also destroyed.</p>

<p>Ants in the garden are psychic. They set up housekeeping in
their intricate nests with no apparent adjacent food supply.
Somehow they know that the next day the owner of the garden will
plant lettuce seed. Their larders are swept and waiting, and the
night after the lettuce seed bed has been watered down in the
fatuous hope of its sprouting, the ants move in en masse and
carry it home. Local custom scatters hominy grits around any
freshly planted bed of small seeds, but from its inefficacy, I
think it must be intended only as a propitiatory rite, for the
ants first take away the seeds, then return to make off with the
grits.</p>

<p>Ants in the house seem to be, not intruders, but the owners.
Of all things they seem the least aware of human beings. Even a
cockroach will scuttle at sight of the mistress of the kitchen,
but a colony of ants goes ahead with its thievery under her eye
and fury. Every other creature that comes to mind sees us with
bright eyes as man-things and enemies. I have often wondered what
appearance we make to the ants that they so ignore us. We must
loom up to them with the detachment of a storm cloud, and when
human hands take away the feast of the cake, or shake the busy
thieves from the cold biscuit, it must seem as though only a
strong wind had disrupted their activities. This is not
flattering and it may be that my dislike is born of a deflated
ego. It is disconcerting, too, to be outsmarted. I lost a
birthday cake placed on a pan inside a basin of water sitting on
a table whose legs were bound with ant-proof "Hoodoo Tape,"
because I forgot, and the ants did not, that a wire leading from
the wall to an electric fan on the table made the easiest of
runways.</p>

<p>Oddly, for all their sweet tooth and their innocent love of
aphis milk and lettuce seed, ants are fiercely carnivorous. It is
meat for which they would tear you limb from limb. Eat your lamb
chop in the tropics while you may, for if you are gone from the
room long enough to identify a new butterfly, you will return to
find your plate already under fire. The small red sugar ants are
omnipresent, but they distress me only mildly, perhaps because
they are so small. I do not particularly mind a few floating in
my coffee. When little black Ben protested the ants on his cold
cornpone, Martha overrode him.</p>

<p>"Chile, antses is fine fo' the stummick-ache," she said
suavely.</p>

<p>He wanted plainly to insist that he had no stomach ache, but
did not, for experience had taught him that Martha would have an
answer for that, too.</p>

<p>One Saturday night I heard a Negro boy ask for a cinnamon bun
in Cap'n Howard's store.</p>

<p>"There you are, boy. The last one."</p>

<p>The Negro was suspicious before the storekeeper's
heartiness.</p>

<p>"Lemme look, boss. Uh-huh. Hit's got antses."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, nigger? A few ants don't
matter."</p>

<p>"No suh, boss, a few don't, but this bun am all antses."</p>

<p>Before I left another black boy made the mistake of handing
over his nickel without looking at the package. Cap'n had the
nickel and he had the antses. He walked slowly out of the store,
picking them out by the dozens with a sorrowful philosophy.</p>

<p>Philosophy of a sort is possible toward all the ants except
the black stinging ant. He at least is enough aware of humans to
fling himself on their flesh if they step within a foot of his
path. He jumps with an insane frenzy, doubling up his body in an
effort to sink his jaws to the bone. His bite is liquid fire and
the infinitesimal speck of acid poison is so potent that it has
been estimated that if he were the size of a rattlesnake, he
would kill in a fraction of its time. I do not know of what use
even to himself his venom may be, for as far as I know, he does
not use it to numb or kill and does not eat living tissue. His
function with small dead things may correspond to that of the
scavenging buzzard, for a dead mouse or snake or bird is covered
within a few minutes by a black voracious swarm.</p>

<p>I include termites deliberately among the ants I have accepted
philosophically. I have read lately that termites are not ants,
but a scientist might as well try to convince me that woodpeckers
are not birds. I include termites in spite of the fact that I
have known for some time they were eating my house down, or up.
The front living room seemed to sway one day when I leaned
against it. I sent for Moe, who began ripping out the old
hand-hewn pine boards. When he had finished, one sound board was
found to have been holding the wall together.</p>

<p>"It's a hell of a wonder," he said, "the roof ain't fell in on
you."</p>

<p>It was termites, of course, and the marvel was not that they
were there, but that they had not demolished the old farmhouse
years ago. Its resistance, Moe said, came from having been built
of solid fat pine, whose resinous juices are distasteful to the
insects. I am no great seeker of silver cloud linings, but I have
had few blessings in disguise greater than the devourers of my
front living room wall. For when the room was laid bare to the
light, I realized that it had been a dark, almost unhappy room,
cozy only on cold winter evenings, when the open fire is all one
wants of comfort, and what goes on in the outside world is of no
importance. Moe replaced the walls and two small windows with
French doors, all the way across the front of the room. Now the
sunlight streams in across the veranda and gives the long shabby
room an elegance that comes from being one with the sky and
clouds, the orange trees and the palms, with the red birds like
moving flowers across the panes. And when the winter's-night
coziness is wanted, the long linen curtains may be drawn, and the
hearth fire lighted, and the old snug closeness is still
there.</p>

<p>A plausible youth with a tank on a truck once tried to
persuade me to let him "exterminate" my termites. I needed no
proof that they were with me, but he burrowed under the house to
make his point and after frightening a setting hen from her nest
near one chimney, emerged with termites clustered in dozens on
his shirt sleeves. For a hundred and twenty dollars, he would
guarantee that they would make no further depredations for a
period of three years. I was afraid that it might turn out like
the boy with the cinnamon bun, that he would have the hundred and
twenty dollars and I would still have the termites. And forty
dollars a year seemed a good deal of money for any purely
destructive activity. I consulted Moe.</p>

<p>"Now the only way you can cold-out exterminate them knockers,"
he said, "is to tear down the house and burn it. And enough of
'em'll be laying up waitin' to set right in on the new house.
Don't think I ain't had an eye on them sills and joists. I figger
it'll take them termite jessies about five years more to finish
their meal. Then I aim just to set in and put you in a new set o'
floors and underpinnin's. And it ain't goin' to average you no
forty dollars a year."</p>

<p>"Starting with new good pine, how long should the job be good
for?"</p>

<p>"Hit'll take a batch o' termites a good twenty years to eat
out the bottom of a house. If it's fat pine, now."</p>

<p>"Well, I have an idea about twenty years may see me through.
We'll gamble on the house and me holding out together."</p>

<p>My race with the termites against time has a sporting element.
Having lived long enough already to know that a world may turn
upside down in twenty years, I am leaving my termites to their
gnawing. Who knows but that some insect enemy may appear to wipe
out their solid existence, while my own topsy-turvy world in that
period may stabilize? At the moment, the odds are of course with
the termites.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Martha," I asked, "just exactly what is a varmint?"</p>

<p>"Why, a wild-cat be's a varmint, Sugar," she said. "Skunks be
varmints, an' 'coons an' foxes an' 'possums. Minkses, too. A
panther be's a varmint, an' a bear. All them wild things, Sugar,
out in the woods. Tigers be varmints, an' lions. A lion," she
said earnestly, "he'll kill you right now. We ain't got tigers
an' lions, praise God, but did we have, they'd be varmints."</p>

<p>She pondered.</p>

<p>"But a cow, now, Sugar, hit ain't a varmint. Nor a hog. Them's
beas'es."</p>

<p>She chuckled.</p>

<p>"Heap o' folkses be varmints," she said.</p>

<p>A varmint then, is any one of the wild things in the woods
either definitely predatory or of no domestic service. A human
varmint is one who possesses skulking qualities and may be
expected to be "low down." We use the epithets "bastard" and "son
of a bitch" freely in these parts, and the former in particular
is not a fighting term, but may even be used with a certain
amount of affection. It is objectionable only when it is
literally true, and then, of course, one would never use it. When
I stayed in the Big Scrub with Leonard and his mother, he
complained about unfriendly activities of his cousin. He referred
to him as to many others as "that bastard." To my surprise, his
mother, accustomed if never reconciled to his language, took
violent issue.</p>

<p>"Now you're throwin' off on my sister," she said. "She's a
good woman. Don't you go callin' her boy a bastard."</p>

<p>Leonard grinned amiably.</p>

<p>"All right then," he said, "call him the pimp."</p>

<p>She was satisfied.</p>

<p>"That's a whole heap better," she said. "The pimp."</p>

<p>In deference to her feelings, her nephew was thenceforward
"the pimp."</p>

<p>But when we call any one a varmint, we mean it.</p>

<p>Of "all them wild things out in the woods," the panther
remains the only one in Florida still gilded with the bright
legend of fear. To hear a panther scream is to add a new horror
to the catalogue of evil. I have heard the sound twice, once
above the Ocklawaha River and once in the wilds of Gulf Hammock
near the Suwannee River. It is the shriek of a vampire woman, an
insane shrill tremolo, half laughter and half moan. Any two or
three generation backwoodsman can tell of a child pounced on at
the edge of a clearing; of wagons followed; of the sight of a
lithe body like a tawny ghost, with its head in the gallberry
bushes on one side of the road and its tail in the myrtle on the
other. Soon after the last panther in the Big Scrub disappeared,
the one I had heard, Fred Tompkins thought he had run afoul of
its ghost.</p>

<p>"I'd put Raymond Boyt out of the boat at Eureka," he said,
"and was paddling up to Orange Springs to the camp. Night
overtakened me and I begun to feel a mite creepified. You know
how black it gets on the Ocklawaha, the way them banks lifts up,
and the trees thick and the water dark. Direckly I catches sight
of a pair of eyes half-ways up the left bank. They was wide apart
and I knowed whatever was behind 'em had considerable size to it.
Thinks I, could be that's a deer, come down to water. Now you
know the law says you can't fire-hunt deer at night, and I says
to myself, 'Was I to bop one to them eyes, will the law call it
fire-hunting?' Then I decides 'tain't a deer, for the eyes is too
redlike. A deer's eyes shines green, like a dog's. The current
was carrying me close, and thinks I, now whatever 'tis, 'tain't
a-going to set there quiet and me passing it. I ain't aiming to
have nothing dropping down on my shoulders in a plumb dark night
on the Ocklawaha River. So I lifts my gun and I bams at the eyes.
You know I usually hit what I aims at. Well, them eyes don't
blink no more nor quit looking at me. I fires again, Bam! and the
eyes is still there. I shoves in a fresh shell and I shoots one
more time. Them eyes goes right on looking at me.</p>

<p>"Fred, I says to myself, that ain't natural. You get out of
here right now. You know I ain't superstitious, but when a pair
of eyes I'd done shot at three times was yet there, I figured
something was wrong. It come to me about that panther had
disappeared from along the river. Fred, I says to myself, do you
reckon you've done been shooting at that panther's damn ghost?
You got to make allowance for the black night, and the creepified
feeling a river'll give you in the dark. I sold out. I didn't say
nothing to the men at camp when I got there. Next morning my
spirits had done rose, and I says to myself, Fred, you ain't
going to take a licking from no damn pair of eyes you shoot at
and they don't shut. So I paddles back up the river to the place
I figured was about right. I goes up a ways and drifts back down.
And you know what? I'd done shot a wild-cat in a scrub oak tree,
and it was laying in a crotch of the tree, and when I hit him, he
had no place to go but to lay right there in the crotch, and them
eyes was as dead as my great granddaddy, but they'd gone right on
looking at me. Now you know I'm plumb proud I went back and found
that thing, or I'd of figured all the rest of my life there was a
damn panther's ghost on the Ocklawaha River."</p>

<p>The panthers now in Florida are a few in Gulf Hammock and a
number still in the Everglades. Somehow the fiction had built up
that there were none in the state. A few years ago, hunters from
Arizona brought their pack of dogs to the Everglades to hunt
panther. Outsiders laughed at the idea. Panthers were taken in
plenty and still prowl the 'Glades, killing deer and cattle. No
one knows what became of the last one in the Big Scrub. I was
startled to find "tygers" listed among Florida's wild animals in
the <i>Travels of William Bartram</i>, but a footnote explained
that while these were called panthers in Pennsylvania, the
Carolina and Florida natives called them tygers. The name has
disappeared in the hundred and fifty years since Bartram's
chronicle, and even the old-timers call them only "painters" or
"panter-cats."</p>

<p>The panther's half-cousin, the wild-cat, seems only a cross,
naughty boy. Although wild-cats were hunted with hounds at Cross
Creek thirty years ago, and although the snarling cry kept me
awake the first night I slept here at the grove, and a large one
has been haunting my duck-pen of late, I am not personally
acquainted with the animal. I should like to be, and should not
be afraid, for it is I who would be the object of terror. A
wildcat is more bashful than a squirrel. He spits like any
self-conscious cat, not sure of the world's intentions. He is
probably never more than three feet from nose to tail. I missed
close acquaintance with a whole wild-cat family one gray dawn in
the heart of the scrub. In the dew-moist sand road were the
tracks of a mother wild-cat and her kittens. They had seen or
scented us and had turned off into the dense undergrowth of
gallberry and scrub oak. The treads were so fresh that the sand
was crumbling into the depressions made by the paws. Leonard and
I paid our respects to maternal feeling and did not follow. The
mother's track was perhaps four inches in diameter. Those of the
kittens were the size of ordinary house cats'.</p>

<p>The smaller varmints may all be identified by their tracks.
The long pointed hand of the 'coon, the dainty, birdlike mark of
the skunk, are unmistakable. All these smaller creatures are
delightful on close acquaintance, and the young of any of them
may be made a fine pet. An old colored man at Micanopy guarantees
to make a household joy of any skunk. His price is a dollar and a
half.</p>

<p>"I only gits me a dollar profit," he explains, "count o'
havin' to spend fifty cents for Hoyt's Cologne 'fore my old
woman'll leave me come in the house again. To say nothin' o'
havin' to wash all over. To say nothin' o' my feelin's."</p>

<p>In the light of one's feelings, a dollar profit for removing a
skunk's musk-sack seems little enough.</p>

<p>My own closest association with a skunk embarrassed me because
of the picture it gave me of my Negroes' conception of my
psychology and habits. My friend Dessie was spending the night at
the grove. Early in the morning I heard a commotion in the
chicken coop where two fryers were penned for fattening. I called
Dessie and she came from her room with her revolver. We went
together to the coop.</p>

<p>She said, "That's a skunk in there."</p>

<p>I said, "But I don't smell anything."</p>

<p>"You don't always smell a skunk."</p>

<p>I said, "I'll bet you a dinner that it's not a skunk."</p>

<p>I held a flashlight while she peered into the coop. Her
revolver barked and barked again. An unmistakable odor sailed
suffocatingly from the coop.</p>

<p>I said, "You win," and we laughed noisily.</p>

<p>The next morning I said to black Raymond, "You weren't much
help last night. You must have heard the commotion. Why didn't
you show up?"</p>

<p>"I heered the ruckus all right," he said. "But I heered you
shootin' and I heered you laughin' and I figgered you was just
playin'."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Some years ago I met a tame raccoon for the first time. It
belonged across the Creek to Mrs. Guthrie's small boy. I was
enchanted by her account of its friendship with the family watch
dog, a dog who is the only one of my experience to bite me. It
had never occurred to me to be afraid of a dog. I thought I knew
the secret of handling vicious dogs, which is to walk calmly and
steadily toward them, calling, "Come here, boy." This might have
worked with the Guthrie dog if I had known that he was dangerous.
I walked into their yard one day when no one was at home, in
search of permission to hunt across their fields. The dog walked
quietly behind me and as I crossed what to him was the boundary
line permitted to intruders, he as quietly sunk his teeth in the
calf of my leg. I had on heavy boots, but I carried the bruise
and soreness for weeks. News that this dog was friendly with the
boy's raccoon seemed to me spectacular.</p>

<p>I have unearthed the notes that I made at the time. They are
lyrical and useless. I could not foresee that I should have a pet
'coon of my own at a later day and that he would make a farce of
them. They may possibly apply to the average pet 'coon, but they
most assuredly do not apply to Racket. I have a strong suspicion
that he was an individualist.</p>

<p>Note: A young pet raccoon needs far less discipline in the
matter of housebreaking than the most aristocratic puppy.</p>

<p>Correction: Racket refused outright to be housebroken. He knew
what he was doing and he did it on purpose. He waited for women
in their best dresses. He did not like women, anyway. He tricked
them. He climbed amiably on the shoulder of the wife of a
university president, in gray lace. She said, "He likes me! Isn't
he cunning!" Then--. He <i>knew</i> what he was doing.</p>

<p>Note: A 'coon is as clean as most human beings. It washes its
dear little hands and face with a frequency that Mrs. Guthrie
urges her small boy to emulate. Any food except a plate directly
from the table, the admirable creature washes carefully before
eating.</p>

<p>Correction: Racket didn't wash anything. He liked dirt.</p>

<p>Note: When punished, it cries pitifully, like a child.</p>

<p>Correction: When punished, Racket bit pieces out of you.</p>

<p>Note: It snuggles confidently and touchingly in human laps and
on human shoulders.</p>

<p>Correction: Yes, but see correction above for ulterior
motive.</p>

<p>Note: The entente cordiale between a pet 'coon and the family
dog speaks movingly for the strength of environment as against
the pull of heredity. There are unplumbed depths of possible
relations between man and beast, and beast and beast.</p>

<p>Correction: Racket did everything possible to make a tramp of
my young pointer, Pat. He played with him, indeed, but so
strenuously that the dog came whimpering to me to be gotten out
of the clutches of an indefatigable small ball of gray fur who
gnawed all day on his legs and tail. Racket seduced Pat into
going into the marsh with him beyond the grove. They would
disappear in the morning, and toward dusk the dog would come
limping home, utterly exhausted and covered with marsh mud.
Racket would come home the next day, as fresh as a daisy, and
having been in the open for thirty-six hours, would make for the
top of the bookshelves for his own purposes. He would then head
for the kitchen if not caught at it, swing himself up to the
table where an extra pan of milk usually sat, and would climb
into the pan for a bath. Trailing milk all through the house, he
would find the cringing dog and begin to chew.</p>

<p>Note: A 'coon has a most ingratiating curiosity.</p>

<p>Correction: Racket was curious but not ingratiating. He
learned to open screen doors from either side. There are eight
screen doors in the farmhouse and it was impossible to keep all
eight locked all the time. Life wasn't worth living if you had to
go around locking screen doors. Racket preferred to pull one open
and come in when you were not looking. It was no fun to come in
under your eye and be stopped from whatever he had thought up to
do. I was having dinner on the veranda. My new silk-lined coat
was on the chair, for the spring evening was cool. Some one
called me from the rear and I left the veranda. When I returned,
my dinner was gone. It was liver and bacon and French fried
potatoes. Racket had slipped in through the front screen door. I
didn't so much mind the dinner, but he had taken it from the
serving platter and moved it to the silk lining of my new coat to
eat it--liver and bacon and French fried potatoes.</p>

<p>He could open all the ice-box doors. One day the colored
iceman let out unholy shrieks. He had not noticed that the door
of the ice compartment was ajar. He swung it open, and there sat
Racket on top of the cake of ice, eating raw breakfast bacon.</p>

<p>Note: A pet 'coon has a deep capacity for personal devotion.
The Guthrie 'coon sleeps with the boy, his little iron-gray body
under the covers, his strange black-masked face on the pillow
beside the child's, like a changeling brother.</p>

<p>Correction: Racket was only devoted to Racket. He had no
desire to sleep with me, but if I left one of my bedroom screen
doors unlatched, he liked to slip in about midnight, nip my ear
with teeth like hypodermic needles, and slip out again.</p>

<p>Note: A 'coon learns early to eat everything the family eats.
He soon takes to canned salmon, cooked fish and scrambled
eggs.</p>

<p>Correction: Racket was half grown before he would touch
anything but rich warm milk. How so ferocious an infant clung so
long to the bottle, I do not know, unless he knew that it made
the most trouble. He was brought to me as a baby. A colored boy
brought me two in a cracker box, and remembering that Uncle
Barney Dillard had told me that of twin young of many animals,
one would have a mean eye and one a kind eye, I picked. My
mistake--I picked Racket. I fed him from a baby's nursing bottle
and in a few days he had learned to lie on his back and balance
it on his stomach with his hind paws, gripping the top with his
forepaws. In a week, he had learned, when done with the milk, to
chew the rubber nipple to bits. It took more nipples to raise him
than to raise the Dionnes. When offered canned salmon, cooked
fish and scrambled eggs, he growled menacingly and I hurried to
replace his so-called natural foods with milk. If insufficiently
warm or with too low a percentage of cream, he took a chunk out
of my hand.</p>

<p>He weaned himself in a way possible only to Racket. I have a
friend who is addicted to my Alexander cocktails, for my thick
Jersey cream blends smoothly with the gin and cr&ecirc;me de
cacao to make a perfect Alexander. I made a shaker of them one
afternoon and we sat on the veranda with new-filled glasses in
our hands. Racket came swinging in, jumped into my lap and
reached up his small human hands to see what was in my glass. He
growled when I tried to lift it out of his reach. Most animals
are Puritans about liquor and turn away their heads in disgust at
the smell of it. I not only wanted to avoid being bitten, but I
was certain that Racket too would be content to jump down like a
good boy when he scented the gin. I put the cocktail to his
pointed nose. He clutched the stem and drank the whole cocktail
and licked the glass. It was over in a moment. W. C. Fields never
tossed down a drink with greater speed or gusto.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Racket was paying the piper. Not that he
minded, for he held his liquor, but his eyes crossed and his legs
would not support him. He wabbled about, as cross-eyed as an owl,
and disappeared. I saw no more of him and was busy the rest of
the afternoon seeing to preparations for dinner, for guests were
coming. When they arrived, I led the women into my bedroom to
take off their hats. Racket was on my pillow, sleeping it off. I
was grateful, for it would keep him out of the way while we dined
on the veranda. Half-way through dinner I heard a pattering of
little feet and Racket came swaggering out. He hunched his
shoulders like a prizefighter. All his bearing was that of a
bully who has come into his own. He was cold sober and pleased
with himself. He swung under the table. I suppose he nipped a
female ankle, for one of the women let out a shriek and tossed a
pair of frog-legs to the floor.</p>

<p>I said nervously, in the manner of one trying to pretend that
all is well, "Oh, he won't touch it. He won't take anything but
milk."</p>

<p>Racket pounced on the frog-legs with a snarl and ate them
bones and all. He ate six pairs. He never touched milk again. He
was a man. A fellow who could down two ounces of gin could do
anything.</p>

<p>I gave him up gladly. There was no use in turning him loose in
the woods, for I think he would have come home to nip me at
midnight from ten miles away. A farmer once reported seeing him,
swaggering in his small leather collar, five miles from home. I
took him to Ross Allen's zoo, thirty miles away, to be penned. A
year later he led a jail break. He worked at the latch of the
cage until he opened it. He took five other 'coons with him to
freedom.</p>

<p>A year ago Little Will heard a commotion late at night on the
steps of the tenant house. He opened the door and flashed a
light. An enormous 'coon was digging in a box of rubbish. He
growled and jumped at the man, then turned coolly on his heel and
sauntered away into the darkness. Something tells me it was
Racket.</p>

<p>"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast
done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every
beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>

</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Fear of the serpent is inherent in most animals. A placid mare
has bolted under me like any wild filly at sight of a coiled
moccasin by the road. I have seen my cat jump with arched back
like a witch's cat, at the unexpected movement of a garter snake.
All hunters have seen their bird dogs tumble backward to avoid a
snake. If avoidance is impossible, the dog comes to an
unforgettable point, obviously not on birds, a point that is one
long tense quiver of distress.</p>

<p>I believe that, contrary to Biblical implications, fear of
snakes is not inherent in human beings, but is planted at an age
so early that memory draws no line for its beginnings. Fear is
the most easily taught of all lessons, and the fight against
terror, real or imagined, is perhaps the history of man's mind.
The average man or woman says, and believes it, "I have an
instinctive horror of snakes." Yet babies and small children, who
might be instinctively terrified at sight of a large animal such
as a cow or dog, show no fear of snakes, but reach out their
hands to them, and have even been known to handle venomous snakes
without harm.</p>

<p>I came to Cross Creek with such a phobia against snakes that a
picture of one in the dictionary gave me what Martha calls "the
all-overs." I had the common misconception that in Florida they
were omnipresent. I thought, "If anything defeats me, sends me
back to urban civilization, it will be the snakes." They were not
ubiquitous as I expected, but I saw one often enough to keep my
anxiety alive. A black snake actually ran at me, and a chicken
snake thrust his face into mine from a pantry shelf. These were
harmless, I knew, but none the less revolting. I took my first
faltering steps of progress through sheer shame. In a section
where the country women possess great physical fearlessness, I
felt feeble-minded to find myself screaming at sight of a king
snake that asked nothing more than a chance to destroy the rats
that infested the old barn. I forced myself to stand still when I
saw a snake in the weeds of the neglected house yard, at least
long enough to determine its non-venomous nature. The only
poisonous reptiles in Florida, I knew, were the rattlesnake and
the cottonmouth moccasin, which I had already seen with horror,
and the coral snake, which I did not know.</p>

<p>My determination to use common sense might have been my
undoing. One late winter day in my first year I discovered under
the palm tree by the gate a small pile of Amaryllis bulbs. The
yard was desperate for flowers and greenery and I began
separating the bulbs to set out for spring blooming. I dug with
my fingers under the pile and brought out in my hand not a snake,
surely, but a ten-inch long piece of Chinese lacquer. The slim
inert reptile was an exquisite series of shining bands of yellow
and black and vermilion, with a tiny black nose. I thought, "Here
is a snake, in my hands, and it is as beautiful as a necklace.
This is the moment in which to forget all nonsense." I let it
slide back and forth through my fingers. Its texture was like
satin. I played with it a long time, then killed it reluctantly
with a stick, not for fear or hate, but because I decided to cure
the skin for an ornament on the handle of a riding crop. I salted
the hide and tacked it to a sunny wall. I showed it proudly to my
friend Ed Hopkins, who was teaching me the Florida flora and
fauna.</p>

<p>He said, "God takes care of fools and children."</p>

<p>The snake was the deadly coral snake. Its venom is of the
cobra type, killing within a few minutes by a paralyzing of the
nerves. The old terror was back again, and it seemed to me that I
should never now be able to pass beyond it. I had no fear of
death as death, but the medium was another matter, and one is
certainly entitled to one's prejudices in so personal a matter. I
found that I had still the blind, unthinking, "instinctive"
horror of coming on a poisonous serpent. Nothing could warm the
frozen column that replaced my spine at the thought of finding
myself face to face with a Florida diamond-back rattler. In a
varied life I had discarded one physical fear after another,
finding them harmless when confronted. I said, "I am only afraid
of the intangibles." Yet even such intangibles as poverty and
loneliness might be, simply, accepted, and so disarmed. I
discovered that for me rattlesnakes represented the last outpost
of physical fear.</p>

<p>I discovered this when Ross Allen, a young Florida
herpetologist, invited me to join him on a hunt in the upper
Everglades--for rattlesnakes. At the moment I was passing through
one of those periods of emotional distress that all of us
experience, when some personal catastrophe has tumbled our house
of cards about our ears. My small world had crumbled. I should
have said offhand that there was nothing left to frighten me.
Instantly I realized that I was numb all over at the thought of
going out of my way to encounter rattlesnakes.</p>

<p>I am something of a fatalist, in that I believe in a fatalism
that stems from one's own adjustment, or lack of it, to
circumstance. The Chinese call this "luck character," and it is
the same thing. This rather out of the way invitation had been
laid on my doorstep like an unwanted foundling. There was no
better time to see the thing through; to go down in defeat and
hysteria before my fear; or, by facing it, to rip away the veil
of panic that stood, perhaps, between me and the facts. I got out
of bed, where my mental agony was causing physical symptoms, and
packed my bag.</p>

<p>Ross and I drove to Arcadia in his coup&eacute; on a warm
January day.</p>

<p>I said, "How will you bring back the rattlesnakes?"</p>

<p>"In the back of my car."</p>

<p>My courage was not adequate to inquire whether they were
thrown in loose and might be expected to appear between our feet.
Actually, a large portable box of heavy close-meshed wire made a
safe cage. Ross wanted me to write an article about his work and
on our way to the unhappy hunting grounds I took notes on a mass
of data that he had accumulated in years of herpetological
research. The scientific and dispassionate detachment of the
material and the man made a desirable approach to rattlesnake
territory. As I had discovered with the insects and varmints, it
is difficult to be afraid of anything about which enough is
known, and Ross' facts were fresh from the laboratory.</p>

<p>The hunting ground was Big Prairie, south of Arcadia and west
of the northern tip of Lake Okeechobee. Big Prairie is a desolate
cattle country, half marsh, half pasture, with islands of palm
trees and cypress and oaks. At that time of year the cattlemen
and Indians were burning the country, on the theory that the
young fresh wire grass that springs up from the roots after a
fire is the best cattle forage. Ross planned to hunt his rattlers
in the forefront of the fires. They lived in winter, he said, in
gopher holes, coming out in the midday warmth to forage, and
would move ahead of the flames and be easily taken. We joined
forces with a big Cracker named Will, his snake-hunting companion
of the territory, and set out in early morning, after a long
rough drive over deep-rutted roads into the open wilds.</p>

<p>I hope never in my life to be so frightened as I was in those
first few hours. I kept on Ross' footsteps, I moved when he
moved, sometimes jolting into him when I thought he might leave
me behind. He does not use the forked stick of conventional snake
hunting, but a steel prong, shaped like an L, at the end of a
long stout stick. He hunted casually, calling my attention to the
varying vegetation, to hawks overhead, to a pair of the rare
whooping cranes that flapped over us. In mid-morning he stopped
short, dropped his stick, and brought up a five-foot rattlesnake
draped limply over the steel L. It seemed to me that I should
drop in my tracks.</p>

<p>"They're not active at this season," he said quietly. "A snake
takes on the temperature of its surroundings. They can't stand
too much heat for that reason, and when the weather is cool, as
now, they're sluggish."</p>

<p>The sun was bright overhead, the sky a translucent blue, and
it seemed to me that it was warm enough for any snake to do as it
willed. The sweat poured down my back. Ross dropped the rattler
in a crocus sack and Will carried it. By noon, he had caught
four. I felt faint and ill. We stopped by a pond and went
swimming. The region was flat, the horizon limitless, and as I
came out of the cool blue water I expected to find myself
surrounded by a ring of rattlers. There were only Ross and Will,
opening the lunch basket. I could not eat. Ross never touches
liquor and it seemed to me that I would give my hope of salvation
for a dram of whiskey. Will went back and drove his truck closer,
for Ross expected the hunting to be better in the afternoon. The
hunting was much better. When we went back to the truck to
deposit two more rattlers in the wire cage, there was a
rattlesnake lying under the truck.</p>

<p>Ross said, "Whenever I leave my car or truck with snakes
already in it, other rattlers always appear. I don't know whether
this is because they scent or sense the presence of other snakes,
or whether in this arid area they come to the car for shade in
the heat of the day."</p>

<p>The problem was scientific, but I had no interest.</p>

<p>That night Ross and Will and I camped out in the vast spaces
of the Everglades prairies. We got water from an abandoned well
and cooked supper under buttonwood bushes by a flowing stream.
The camp fire blazed cheerfully under the stars and a new moon
lifted in the sky. Will told tall tales of the cattlemen and the
Indians and we were at peace.</p>

<p>Ross said, "We couldn't have a better night for catching water
snakes."</p>

<p>After the rattlers, water snakes seemed innocuous enough. We
worked along the edge of the stream and here Ross did not use his
L-shaped steel. He reached under rocks and along the edge of the
water and brought out harmless reptiles with his hands. I had
said nothing to him of my fears, but he understood them. He
brought a small dark snake from under a willow root.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to hold it?" he asked. "People think snakes
are cold and clammy, but they aren't. Take it in your hands.
You'll see that it is warm."</p>

<p>Again, because I was ashamed, I took the snake in my
hands.</p>

<p>It was not cold, it was not clammy, and it lay trustingly in
my hands, a thing that lived and breathed and had mortality like
the rest of us. I felt an upsurgence of spirit.</p>

<p>The next day was magnificent. The air was crystal, the sky was
aquamarine, and the far horizon of palms and oaks lay against the
sky. I felt a new boldness and followed Ross bravely. He was
making the rounds of the gopher holes. The rattlers came out in
the mid-morning warmth and were never far away. He could tell by
their trails whether one had come out or was still in the hole.
Sometimes the two men dug the snake out. At times it was down so
long and winding a tunnel that the digging was hopeless. Then
they blocked the entrance and went on to other holes. In an hour
or so they made the original rounds, unblocking the holes. The
rattler in every case came out hurriedly, as though anything were
preferable to being shut in. All the time Ross talked to me,
telling me the scientific facts he had discovered about the
habits of the rattlers.</p>

<p>"They pay no attention to a man standing perfectly still," he
said, and proved it by letting Will unblock a hole while he stood
at the entrance as the snake came out. It was exciting to watch
the snake crawl slowly beside and past the man's legs. When it
was at a safe distance he walked within its range of vision,
which he had proved to be no higher than a man's knee, and the
snake whirled and drew back in an attitude of fighting defense.
The rattler strikes only for paralyzing and killing its food, and
for defense.</p>

<p>"It is a slow and heavy snake," Ross said. "It lies in wait on
a small game trail and strikes the rat or rabbit passing by. It
waits a few minutes, then follows along the trail, coming to the
small animal, now dead or dying. It noses it from all sides,
making sure that it is its own kill, and that it is dead and
ready for swallowing."</p>

<p>A rattler will lie quietly without revealing himself if a man
passes by and it thinks it is not seen. It slips away without
fighting if given the chance. Only Ross' sharp eyes sometimes
picked out the gray and yellow diamond pattern, camouflaged among
the grasses. In the cool of the morning, chilled by the January
air, the snakes showed no fight. They could be looped up limply
over the steel L and dropped in a sack or up into the wire cage
on the back of Will's truck. As the sun mounted in the sky and
warmed the moist Everglades earth, the snakes were warmed too,
and Ross warned that it was time to go more cautiously. Yet
having learned that it was we who were the aggressors; that
immobility meant complete safety; that the snakes, for all their
lightning flash in striking, were inaccurate in their aim, with
limited vision; having watched again and again the liquid grace
of movement, the beauty of pattern, suddenly I understood that I
was drinking in freely the magnificent sweep of the horizon, with
no fear of what might be at the moment under my feet. I went off
hunting by myself, and though I found no snakes, I should have
known what to do.</p>

<p>The sun was dropping low in the west. Masses of white cloud
hung above the flat marshy plain and seemed to be tangled in the
tops of distant palms and cypresses. The sky turned orange, then
saffron. I walked leisurely back toward the truck. In the
distance I could see Ross and Will making their way in too. The
season was more advanced than at the Creek, two hundred miles to
the north, and I noticed that spring flowers were blooming among
the lumpy hummocks. I leaned over to pick a white violet. There
was a rattlesnake under the violet.</p>

<p>If this had happened the week before, if it had happened the
day before, I think I should have lain down and died on top of
the rattlesnake, with no need of being struck and poisoned. The
snake did not coil, but lifted its head and whirred its rattles
lightly. I stepped back slowly and put the violet in a
buttonhole. I reached forward and laid the steel L across the
snake's neck, just back of the blunt head. I called to Ross:</p>

<p>"I've got one."</p>

<p>He strolled toward me.</p>

<p>"Well, pick it up," he said.</p>

<p>I released it and slipped the L under the middle of the thick
body.</p>

<p>"Go put it in the box."</p>

<p>He went ahead of me and lifted the top of the wire cage. I
made the truck with the rattler, but when I reached up the six
feet to drop it in the cage, it slipped off the stick and dropped
on Ross' feet. It made no effort to strike.</p>

<p>"Pick it up again," he said. "If you'll pin it down lightly
and reach just back of its head with your hand, as you've seen me
do, you can drop it in more easily."</p>

<p>I pinned it and leaned over.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," I said, "but you're pushing me a little
too fast."</p>

<p>He grinned. I lifted it on the stick and again as I had it at
head height, it slipped off, down Ross' boots and on top of his
feet. He stood as still as a stump. I dropped the snake on his
feet for the third time. It seemed to me that the most patient of
rattlers might in time resent being hauled up and down, and for
all the man's quiet certainty that in standing motionless there
was no danger, would strike at whatever was nearest, and that
would be Ross.</p>

<p>I said, "I'm just not man enough to keep this up any longer,"
and he laughed and reached down with his smooth quickness and
lifted the snake back of the head and dropped it in the cage. It
slid in among its mates and settled in a corner. The hunt was
over and we drove back over the uneven trail to Will's village
and left him and went on to Arcadia and home. Our catch for the
two days was thirty-two rattlers.</p>

<p>I said to Ross, "I believe that tomorrow I could have picked
up that snake."</p>

<p>Back at the Creek, I felt a new lightness. I had done battle
with a great fear, and the victory was mine.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for me ever to feel affection for a
snake. One may be ever so interested and tolerant, but prefer
work dogs to lap dogs, dogs to cats, cats to horses, and almost
any living thing at all, to snakes. But with the conquering of
the horror, it has been possible to watch the comings and goings
of various reptiles with conjectures as to their habits and to
consider them as personalities.</p>

<p>A king snake lived for several years in a hole beside the
front gate. When the first strong sun of spring, in February or
early March, struck into the ground, he appeared, a majestic
fellow, fresh shed, in yellow and black. His favorite place was
coiled on top of the first post to the right of the gate. This
was probably a good vantage point over the passing of rats and
mice, frogs and smaller snakes. He seemed to enjoy being within
sight of human activity and lifted his slim bright-eyed head with
interest when any one went in or out of the gate. He was very
ornamental and when he did not appear on his post I felt a
certain anxiety about him. I had sweet-peas planted on the fence
one year and often worked and weeded among them as he watched me
a few feet away. Sometimes he slid gracefully into his hole,
leaving a careless half-foot of tail hanging out, as though
hostage to his friendly confidence. He was itchy one season at
shedding time and nothing pleased him more than to have fingers
stroke his back. He lay quietly, rippling his muscles as one does
under the touch of a masseur. He had some sort of rapprochement
with my cat, for I often saw Jib pat the exposed tail playfully
but gently. The king snake withdrew it without hurry and Jib
followed with an unmolesting claw-sheathed paw. Perhaps they
divided their extra rats.</p>

<p>Jib's relations with black snakes did not seem so friendly.
The one who lived under the kitchen came out one morning with a
broken tail, tell-tale slashes at its tip. The innocuous black
snake is both brave and impudent. I walked close to a slim ebony
beauty with his smooth narrow head high above the grass. My
purpose was only to admire at close range but he resented my
attention. He made a running attack at me. Quite naturally, I
jumped out of his way. It reminded me of the utterly ignominious
evening when a skunk chased me down the road for several hundred
yards. Discretion in both cases seemed the better part of valor.
The black snake turned and ran at me again. He switched himself
arrogantly as long as I stood near. When I went away, he retired
in the opposite direction, probably well pleased with himself as
a ferocious and awe-inspiring fellow. The fastest living thing I
have ever seen was a black snake crossing a bed of hot ashes with
a mouse in his mouth. We use the expression here, "Fast as a
black snake," and I can amend it to, "Fast as a black snake with
his belly burning."</p>

<p>I have been obliged to wage unceasing war on the chicken or
oak snakes. If I left them to themselves, we should never raise a
biddy or a young Mallard duck. The snakes ignore nests of
new-laid eggs through the winter. When nesting time comes and the
peanut hay in the loft of the barn is full of the game hens
setting, and the Mallards begin to set under the Turk's-cap
bushes and along the fence row, the chicken snakes appear from
nowhere. Usually they wait for their feast until the night the
hatching begins and swallow the wet chicks and ducklings as they
pip their shells and emerge, for an instant, into the unfriendly
world. It is heart-breaking to leave one of the Mallard mothers
hovering her new brood contentedly one night, and in the morning
to find her childless, fluttering and crying in her distress, the
trail of a chicken snake leading away from the nest. Little Will
and I watch with constant vigilance at these times and at the
first squawk of a hen, the first almost human cry of a female
Mallard, one or the other of us dashes to the nest. I once shot a
very large chicken snake who came to a nest in one corner of the
duck pen while the mother was out getting a bit of green for
herself. He had a duck egg in his mouth and rolled his yellow
eyes at me as he distended his jaws to swallow it. I did not want
to shoot and destroy the other eggs and poked him with the gun
barrel to force him to a place more convenient for my purposes.
He merely wrapped his tail around the mesh of the wire pen, for
purchase, gulped down his egg and opened his jaws over another.
This was too insulting and I gave him one shot in the tail. He
withdrew then, the egg still in his mouth. It was halfway down
before I managed to destroy him.</p>

<p>I have never actually seen a rattlesnake on my land, though
the east hammock is a crossing place for them. I see them
sometimes on the road at the edge of my place, always moving too
rapidly for me to get hold of a hoe or a shotgun. One was killed
at the corner where my house grove joins that of Old Boss, and
the hoe-hands in summer, or Snow and Little Will on the tractor,
come across half a dozen or so in the grove in season. I admire
the great beauty of the diamond-back rattler and feel that as
snakes go, he is very much of a gentleman.</p>

<p>The cottonmouth moccasins make free of the house yard and I
have killed several large ones a few feet from the house. My
friend Ross feels that I fail him in not taking them alive for
him. I have a guilty moment, thinking of the wasted venom that he
would milk from them for scientific and medical purposes, but I
am forced to prefer the death of a poisonous snake in my yard to
not knowing at what moment it will strike the dog, the cat, one
of the Creek children coming for milk, or appear under my own
feet in the darkness. I have no particular fear of the
cottonmouth, for he is sluggish and easily killed, but he is
revolting in appearance. He is darkly nondescript in color, he is
fat and greasy. He slithers. When I look at him I think of
Martha's shuddering summing up of the reasons for her dislike of
all snakes, "Ain't got no footses an' kin slide so!"</p>

<p>I think the motion of all snakes, if watched and studied long
enough, would move any lover of rhythm. I can understand why a
cobra sways to music. The way of the serpent is the way of music.
I have sat on the veranda watching the movement of a green tree
snake rippling in and out among the orange boughs; watching a
black snake flow like water in a dream among the leaves of a
poinsettia, or lie like a Japanese brush stroke along a
spider-lily leaf, and felt that I watched the poetry of motion.
Ruth St. Denis caught this serpentine grace in some of her
Oriental dances. I should like to have seen her use, as the Hopi
Indians use the rattlesnake, the coral snake, in all its jewelled
enamel--properly de-fanged, of course, as a scientist has
recently discovered the Hopi rattlers to be.</p>

<p>I shall always feel an interest in snakes, after my exposure
to Ross' wisdom and knowledge, but it will never extend to making
one welcome in the house. I was obliged to deal unconventionally
a few nights ago with a small cottonmouth in the guest bathroom.
The screen door leading on one side to the porch had been left
ajar and he had wandered in, attracted perhaps by the light
burning there. If the light had not been on, I should have
stepped on him in the dark on my way to my own quarters, for he
was directly in my path. He was small and young but he was
belligerent and quite as venomous as though he had been six feet
long. My first thought was of my .22 rifle or my shotgun on the
back porch, but I knew that if I left the visitor he would slip
away, and I could think of many places where he might reappear
that would be less convenient than his present one. Too, it
seemed absurd to fill the bathroom floor full of holes. The
Negroes would be sound asleep in the tenant house and could not
hear me call. It seemed to me also that I should feel very
foolish having Little Will come from his bed, hoe in hand, to
face so small a creature. I looked around the room behind me. On
the chest of drawers were two books. One was the Sears Roebuck
catalogue, a hefty volume. I heaved it at the moccasin. It hurt
him enough so that he went into convulsive coils instead of
slipping under the bathtub and I knew I could approach closer.
The other book was a copy of one of my own writings, <i>The
Yearling.</i> I took it and finished off the moccasin. I told
Little Will next morning of the encounter, and the method by
which I had dispatched the intruder. He chuckled. "It sho' do
come in handy to write books," he said.</p>

way. The Negro is a congenital liar. There is no dependence to be
put in the best of them.</p>

<p>Back of these superficial truths lies the mystery of the
primitive African nature, subjected precipitously first to
slavery and then to so-called civilization, the one as difficult
and unjust as the other. The Negro today is paid instead of being
rationed. He is left to shift for himself for the most part
instead of being cared for. In the South his wages are a scandal
and there is no hope of racial development until racial economics
are adjusted. Meantime, he continues to be, ostensibly, childish,
carefree, religious, untruthful and unreliable. Back of it all is
a defense mechanism as ingrained as the color of his skin. He
could adapt himself to the injustice of his position and to the
master white race only by being childish, carefree, religious,
untruthful and unreliable.</p>

<p>The prettier side of the picture does indeed lie in the
possibility of real affection between individuals of the two
races, conditioned by the fact that one is master, and the other,
for all of Lincoln, still a slave. The servant has two weapons.
He can make life not worth living for his employer. And he can
walk out. When a southern Negro uses neither of the two, it is
likely to mean, not necessarily that he is well treated, but that
he is truly attached to master or mistress. And he can feel an
actual love, and yet make life miserable or walk out. Therein
lies his unpredictability, and beyond the half-truth of its fact
is a mental and emotional turmoil past the comprehension of the
most old-school southern aristocrat who ever slurred his
witticisms over a mint julep.</p>

<p>I have made one grave mistake in dealing with Negroes at the
grove. I have expected that, given justice and kindness, a
reasonable attitude toward their problems, and wages higher than
the customary ones, they could carry considerable responsibility
and learn to discipline themselves. I should have known better. I
should have understood that only in rare instances can a Negro
work for long on his own initiative. For long years since actual
slavery he has been told what to do and what not to do. He has
used his little time of freedom to cut loose, to escape for the
moment the lowliness and the poverty and the puzzle of living.
Left to himself to work toward an unseen goal without
jurisdiction or direction, no matter how reliable ordinarily, he
realizes suddenly, not that he has responsibilities, but that he
is free, he is on his own, and he pounces without warrant on that
freedom as though it were already the Saturday night he had
earned. I do not blame Kate and Raymond for going wild. I blame
myself for asking of them what most of us manage so painfully and
so inadequately for ourselves.</p>

<p>Kate and Raymond came after 'Geechee and ahead of Martha's
daughter Adrenna. The long line of Negroes has come and gone like
a string of exploding firecrackers, each one arriving on the
smoking heels of another and departing as violently. Most have
gone in insanity, mad love affairs, delirious drunkenness and
shootings. Their shadows lie long and black against the pattern
of the Creek. Kate and Raymond began promisingly. Raymond was
long and lean and very black, as strong as an ox, and in deathly
fear of small Kate. She could make him run in terror, not only
with the butcher knife, but by lifting her little brown hand or
her strong shrill voice. He was a good grove man and I have often
lamented his passing from the Creek. Kate began impudently and on
the defensive. She had never done housework or my kind of cooking
and I had to begin at the bottom. She learned quickly and praise
warmed her.</p>

<p>I left off feeling as though the sword of Damocles hung dark
and pointed over my head. I began to trust the fragile hair by
which it was suspended. I went to the Carolina mountains for the
summer to cool the malaria in my blood and to begin a book. Kate
and Raymond assured me that all would go as well as though I were
at the grove in person. I mailed their weekly pay and had in
return an occasional pencilled note, "The groav is fine. we is
fine."</p>

<p>Of course they were fine. They were having the time of their
lives. It would have been a simple insurance to have delegated
Fred to pay them for me, to let them know there was still
authority over them. In my stupidity I pounded my typewriter
happily and drank in the good mountain air. Autumn came and the
mountain ash and maples and sourwood were gold and crimson. I
think I might still have lingered, but my brother was coming from
Alaska for the hunting season. We were renewing a joyous
relationship after a separation of ten years. I wrote ahead to
Kate and Raymond, specifying house cleaning, dressed chickens in
the icebox, and enclosing money and a grocery list to be
filled.</p>

<p>I drove in to the grove at dusk on a Saturday evening. The
farmhouse was dark. The atmosphere was silent and ominous. No one
came to meet me as my car crossed the cattle-gap and swung into
the yard. I went into the house. It had not been swept or dusted
all summer. Spiders swung comfortably in every corner. I went to
the icebox. There was ice, only, I imagine, because Kate and
Raymond had used it for cooling drinks. There should have been
several pans of milk, for the cow had been fresh when I left.
There was one small pan. It had the thin bluish look that showed
the cow was nearly dry. She could only have dried up by being
improperly and erratically milked. There was nothing else in the
box. I shut the door. I heard a step. Kate came to the porch,
walking rigidly and with glazed eyes.</p>

<p>I asked, "Where's Raymond?"</p>

<p>She waved a vague arm.</p>

<p>"He to the house. He don't feel so good."</p>

<p>"Where are the chickens I wrote you to have dressed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they ain't no mo' chickens. Varmints got 'em."</p>

<p>"But there were fifty-four young chickens when I left."</p>

<p>"Yessum. Varmints got 'em."</p>

<p>I knew the nature of the varmints. We lose a few fryers from
skunks and 'possums, but a watchful man can always catch them at
their depredations after the first kill.</p>

<p>"Why isn't the house clean? Where are the groceries?"</p>

<p>"They wasn't time to do nothin' when your letter come. They
wasn't no money in it nohow."</p>

<p>The letter had been sent ten days before and there was money
in it. I gave Kate a dollar and told her with a calm that I had
never expected to own, to send Raymond in the truck to the
village for bread and coffee for my breakfast. I dismissed her,
for I could not trust my temper. I told myself to go and make a
highball and hold steady. I went to the locked cupboard where I
had left Bourbon. There was nothing there. I looked up to the
ceiling of the cupboard. The square cut for ventilation, covered
with a tightly nailed screen, was ajar. The cupboard had been
entered by going into the attic from a similar vent in another
room and entering to this one. There were no food supplies in the
pantry and in my exhaustion I went to bed hungry. Morning brought
the same silence as when I had driven in the evening before. I
dressed and went to the kitchen. Kate sat dreamily.</p>

<p>"Raymond ain't never come back," she said.</p>

<p>I drove six miles away to Citra. The recalcitrant and
completely happy Raymond had been seen at a Negro boarding house.
My truck sat in front of it. I called. Raymond staggered out with
blank and stupid eyes. He was cramming fried fish into his mouth.
Nothing has ever enraged me like that fried fish, I suppose
because I was so hungry. I told him he was fired. I arranged to
have the Boyts drive the truck home for me. Then I thought,
appalled, of my brother's coming within the next day or two.</p>

<p>Well-trained city Negroes simply will not work in the country,
miles from their kind. There were plenty of field-hands, like
Kate, delighted at the thought of being elevated to housework,
who could be trained into good servants. But the job takes from
six months to a year. I had sweat and toiled with Kate, doing
most of the work myself as I taught her. Given a little time, I
could discipline Kate and even Raymond back into shape. There was
no time for anything. Meantime, my brother's comfort depended on
my being free to hunt and prowl with him, and on coming home at
night to an orderly house and a waiting and edible dinner. He was
driving more than three thousand miles to be with me, and I did
not intend to ruin his visit with my domestic difficulties. It
was no moment in which to fire Kate or to set up a rigid
discipline. I told her that I had fired Raymond but would keep
her on trial. She applauded heartily. Raymond had been the root
of all evil. Left to herself she would have been a model of
deportment. I remembered Raymond shrinking from her voice and
hand. It is of course part of the slave psychology to blame any
one else, mother, father, husband, child, to save one's own hide.
Kate settled down demurely and when my brother arrived he was
unaware of the volcano sizzling under the charm and peace of the
Creek.</p>

<p>"I can't get over the ease and smoothness of this life," he
said, and I smiled blandly.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful, isn't it," I said.</p>

<p>We were home only for breakfast and dinner and to sleep. We
"did" Florida exuberantly. I was amiable with Kate and she was
suave and amiable with me. She had acquired a sweetheart, she
told me, and Raymond was a thing of the past. She would never
forgive him for the great wrong he had done both of us. I saw the
sweetheart slip in at night, and it seemed to me that sometimes I
saw Raymond's long legs swing over the fence, but as long as the
beds were made, the floors swept and dinner prepared, Kate might
be a black Cleopatra for all of me. A healthy hell would pop when
my brother had gone and I would get us all straightened out and
off to a fresh start--probably, I thought, with the penitent
Raymond back again, working better than ever for having sinned.
Hell popped, but it was not healthy and it was not of my making.
Toward the end of his visit, a week-end deer hunt was arranged
for my brother. We left before dawn on a Saturday morning and
reached home again at midnight Sunday.</p>

<p>As we drove in, I heard the cow bawling. She was standing
beside the barn. The car lights showed her bag at bursting point.
She had plainly not been milked or fed or watered since we had
left. My dog yelped from the back porch. He was locked in. His
feed and water pans were bone dry and the porch showed that he
had been there since Saturday morning. In the house the beds had
not been made. Our Saturday breakfast things had been carried out
on a tray and the whole business dumped higgledy-piggledy on the
floor of the pantry. My brother blew up like a geyser.</p>

<p>"I've seen what you have to put up with. We're going over to
the tenant house and run that black ape off."</p>

<p>I tried then to explain, but the time had passed for sound
psychological explanations. I had given them too much leeway,
without supervision, and was only paying the penalty for
something that could be straightened out. I had wanted his visit
free and comfortable. A period of strict discipline after he had
gone would take care of everything. It was too late. We had had
colored help in our Washington days, but he had been only a child
when we left the city and Negroes were as strange to him as
though he had never known them. He had been in the Northwest
where foreign labor was sometimes an ominous thing. Nothing could
convince him now that I was not in peril of my very life.</p>

<p>"This is dangerous," he said, "and I am not going to leave you
here alone without cleaning house before I go."</p>

<p>I tried to murmur my tale of the long training, of what
cleaning house would mean.</p>

<p>"Get your gun," he said.</p>

<p>I gasped.</p>

<p>"We don't need guns. All I have to do is stamp my foot and
they're in deathly terror. Kate would almost die in her tracks if
we shoved a gun at her."</p>

<p>He looked at me pityingly.</p>

<p>We went to the tenant house like an invading army. Arthur
strapped a focussing flashlight to his forehead. He carried his
big-game rifle, a Winchester .30-40 with a telescopic sight. I
had my revolver meekly in my hand. It began to strike me as
extremely funny. My giggles impressed him of course as hysteria.
He patted me protectingly.</p>

<p>"Everything's going to be all right. Just don't lose your
nerve. Don't let them see you're afraid."</p>

<p>I whooped and he held me and poured brandy down my throat.</p>

<p>We crept to the door of the tenant house. Arthur threw it open
with a magnificent gesture and turned the flashlight on the
bed.</p>

<p>"Don't anybody move!" he shouted. "We've got you covered."</p>

<p>We had an amazing assemblage covered. Three occupants of the
bed raised up and blinked in the light. In the middle was Kate,
modestly dressed in a long-sleeved, high-necked flannel
nightgown. On one side of her was the sweetheart, and cozily on
the other side was Raymond. Raymond and the sweetheart were buck
naked. All three were so drunk that their wooly heads wobbled on
their necks. Kate was the first to come to her senses. The light
glinted on the telescopic sight of the Winchester rifle. She let
out a blood-curdling shriek and leaped from the bed.</p>

<p>There began a strange community dance. Dance is the only word
for it. Kate gyrated, flailing her arms. The long flannel
nightgown swirled around her bare shifting feet. The sweetheart
rolled from the bed and jumped up and down, reaching
spasmodically into midair in hope of finding his breeches.
Raymond raised to a sitting position, collapsed on the bed,
raised again and collapsed, rhythmically. As Kate spun around and
around she shrieked, the sound keeping time to her spinning and
the sweetheart's jumps. Around it and through it Arthur pranced.
He is six feet four, thin and gangling, and looks like a cross
between Daniel Boone and Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>"Don't let them rush you!" he bellowed. "Keep your man
covered!"</p>

<p>I wanted to say, "The only rush they'll make is for the great
open spaces," but it was no moment for trivial conversation. "My
man" whom I was covering found his pants. I kept my head turned
away from him and my revolver levelled in his general direction.
Out of the corner of my eye I saw the pants ascending with the
jerky motion of a broken escalator. Raymond had given up. He lay
prone with closed eyes, waiting for Nemesis to descend as it
willed.</p>

<p>Arthur waved the Winchester rifle under his nose and shouted,
"Get up!"</p>

<p>Raymond was past getting up. I do not think he even heard
him.</p>

<p>Kate left off her whirling and begged, "Raymond, honey, the
man gwine kill you where you lay. Get up, honey!"</p>

<p>Raymond opened one eye, groaned, and closed it again. Arthur
pranced to the bed and reached in with one of his long arms and
heaved Raymond to his feet.</p>

<p>"Keep your man covered! I'm taking care of this one."</p>

<p>"My man" was trembling against the wall. Love nor money could
not have made him stir. Kate rushed to cover Raymond's
nakedness.</p>

<p>"Put somethin' over you, honey," she crooned.</p>

<p>Raymond fumbled for the sheet and held it hopefully behind his
back.</p>

<p>"In the front," Kate moaned. "Honey--in the front!"</p>

<p>I made the mental note that, passing sweetheart or no, Raymond
was her truelove. For an instant, I planned our future together.
Raymond would be back, chastened and capable, the sweetheart
would slink on his way, I should never again ask of them more
than they could do, and life at the Creek would go on smoothly
and better than before. Then I knew that something was finished.
One's relations with Negroes are like love affairs. When they
end, they end. Kate packed their suitcase and flanked by lover
and husband, set out down the road toward town in her flannel
nightgown.</p>

<p>My brother was happy at having saved me. When he reads this
account, it will be his first inkling that I should have chosen
differently. I adored being "protected," for I had never had it
in my mature life before. But I was sad. The only compensation
was in finding, now that it was over, that Kate had turned into a
thief. She had taken a considerable amount of money from my
brother's wallet, there were missing some of my best clothes and
several pieces of my mother's silver. Yet even there, I
understood. We had so much and she had so little. We tossed our
wealth about carelessly. Surely we would never miss such trifles
out of our abundance.</p>

<p>There was an interim, as always, when old Martha came in to
take care of me and to tide me over. Between all the explosions
she is here, steady as a lodestar. She is utterly incompetent and
serves a spoon for the eating of scrambled eggs, and her
inabilities grieve her more than they do me.</p>

<p>"Sugar," she mourns, "I wisht you'd ketched me young. You
could of learned me anything."</p>

<p>She had a daughter, Adrenna, in want of a job. Adrenna would
please me. Adrenna came, and I was in deeper than I had ever been
before. A new black-and-white love affair was in the making, and
doomed from its beginning. Adrenna drove me perfectly mad at
first. She claimed to be able to do everything and could do
nothing. When I corrected her in any detail she went to pieces.
It took me several months to realize that she was in great fear
not only of me, but of her own ignorance. When I proceeded on the
tacit theory that in spite of her own protests she knew nothing
of the amenities of living, and taught her as kindly and as
patiently as I had taught Kate, all went well. I never made a
really good servant of her, never a really good cook, for her
mentality was not up to it. But as time went on she learned
certain dishes and certain menus by heart, like a parrot, and I
could order a fixed meal with the certainty that it would be
edible. And the usual love built itself up between us.</p>

<p>I could not believe at first that not only was Adrenna
man-crazy, in her early forties, but that she could rope in
almost any Negro man on whom she concentrated. Trying to see even
through male Negro eyes, I could not detect the faintest trace of
charm. She was slovenly, she received her suitors in untidy rags,
even when good dresses of my giving hung in her cupboard. She
wore her kinky hair in tight pig-tails, like Topsy, or combed
them out into an alarming piece of shrubbery that stood up around
her thin face. She was knock-kneed. She was not young. But when
she swung that shingle-butted rear down the road, the Negro men
followed and were entranced.</p>

<p>She said, as a fact, "You needs a good man on the place."</p>

<p>I said, "Indeed I do."</p>

<p>"You jes' leave it to me. I'll get us a man. One that'll suit
you and one that'll suit me."</p>

<p>Her efforts to trap a man, who should please me by day and her
by night, fell between two stools. One by one she lured them in,
and one by one they were incompetent in one capacity or the
other. She was not discouraged.</p>

<p>"I'll get us one directly can do everything," she said.</p>

<p>I began to be embarrassed about it. Our search was flagrant.
We had a succession of Negro men who occupied one half of the
tenant house while she occupied the other, and while I tried one
aspect and Adrenna tried another. There was Enmon, who pleased me
immensely, and was the best grove and yard man I had ever had.
Enmon was obliged to leave, reluctantly, he assured me, because a
rival suitor of Adrenna, and a much larger and more imposing
suitor, threatened to cut his throat with a razor and Enmon was
sure he meant it. Jeff Davis was promising. He already had a
wife, who came with him to the Creek, but what were wives to
Adrenna? The wife was city-bred, owned a good house, stayed here
briefly and in fury, and drew Jeff Davis back to her solely by
the power of her wordly goods. I had a message from him lately
that his wife had left him and he would like to come back, and
was Adrenna still with me? But meantime Adrenna had gone, and I
have Adrenna's brother Little Will, most satisfactory for the
moment, and I have the perfect maid, and again it was too
late.</p>

<p>Adrenna really worked on Sherman. She had known him in the
hey-day of her youth and she told me that he was everything
either of us could ask. We drove to the farm where he was working
to interview him. I was frank and Adrenna was coy. I took lessons
that day from her technique. Sherman rose to the bait. He longed
to come to us, but he was share-cropping and could not leave
until the crops were marketed.</p>

<p>Adrenna said to me, "You jes' leave it to me. I'll get him for
us."</p>

<p>By the time Sherman's crops were in and he sent word that he
was ready for come what might, Adrenna was off on another tack.
She had roped in Samson. Jeff Davis--Sherman--Samson. She was
nothing if not ambitious. Samson looked too good to be true when
she brought him to the door for my approval. I never knew where
or how she found him. He was tall, light brown and handsome. He
could do and had done, he said, anything and everything--grove
work, garden work and house service and was an expert driver and
mechanic. I sighed with relief.</p>

<p>Adrenna said demurely, "He wants us to move to Miami when us
is married, but I tol' him you'd more'n likely make it worth his
while jes' to stay here."</p>

<p>I jumped into the breech to make it worth his while. I would
stake them to their wedding, with a grand wedding breakfast
afterward, and I would pay him more than I had ever dreamed of
paying before. Adrenna had taken not only Samson, but me, into
camp. I took them to the judge in Gainesville to be married, and
when Adrenna admitted that she was "divo'ced," the judge did not
question it, though I knew that three more or less legal husbands
were still in the offing. But I was desperate and so was Adrenna.
I gave them ten dollars for the wedding party, they went fourteen
miles away to Hawthorn for a week-end honeymoon, and returned to
the tenant house to settle down into what Adrenna and I had both
looked forward to as unmitigated bliss of one sort and
another.</p>

<p>I think that Samson failed Adrenna before he failed me. At
least it took me longer to find out that his boasts were based on
thin air. Out of doors he knew nothing of grove work, inside the
house he did not know a knife from a fork, and when he tried the
first time to drive the farm truck I heard such a clashing of
gears that I thought the car was on its last legs. But he had the
growing hand. He was an expensive gardener, and I luxuriated with
a sense of guilt over the miracles he worked with flowers. I had
delphinium and Canterbury bells for the first time. I had always
wanted a rose-bed, but since I had had to stand threateningly
over previous workers to get the commonest flowers weeded and
watered, it had seemed useless to attempt the care of roses.
Samson begged me to put them in the garden.</p>

<p>"I kin really make roses," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>I ordered the bushes from Texas, red and pink Radiance, Etoile
de Hollande, Talisman, Lady Hillingdon, Ophelia and Luxembourg.
Samson had roses for me in little over a month. It was immensely
elegant, and for what I was paying Samson, who spent most of the
day in the garden, while the grove languished and Adrenna did the
milking for him, I might as well have bought American Beauties
from a florist. I decided that it would be a warm winter and I
really did not need a new winter coat. Adrenna had become
completely necessary to me, we were very much <i>en rapport,</i>
and if the only way to keep her was to pay her ornamental husband
to raise roses, paid he should be, and if I went over the hill to
the poorhouse, I should go magnificently, with armfuls of
roses.</p>

<p>I sensed dimly as the winter went on that Adrenna and Samson
were feuding with Henry. Henry is Sissie's husband and Sissie is
Adrenna's sister and Martha's daughter. Martha had come from
across the Creek to live in the old Mackay house. She dropped
hints that I ignored. Sissie and Henry lived in the little
white-washed shack at the edge of the Creek by the bridge. When
Martha suggested to me that I "kind o' notice the way Henry's
actin'," I decided that Samson and his lordliness irked him. I
began to realize that Samson irked me, too. He was courteous, he
was a beautiful specimen to look at, he was raising roses, but I
just didn't like him. Adrenna was cryptic. I closed my eyes to
the tension. We had worked too hard to get us a man to ask
questions now.</p>

<p>New Year's came, and I went to Daytona for the holidays. I was
sitting in a caf&eacute; when a long distance call came in. The
Gainesville sheriff was trying to reach me.</p>

<p>"A man that works for you, Samson, was shot and isn't expected
to live," he said over the wire. "The hospital wants to know if
you'll guarantee his bill."</p>

<p>"Who shot him?"</p>

<p>"Another one of your Creek niggers. Name of Henry. We've got
him locked up."</p>

<p>"I'll guarantee the bill. I suppose the man will be thrown out
in the street if I don't."</p>

<p>I thought bitterly that if socialized medicine came, it would
be because of things like this.</p>

<p>I reached the hospital by night. Samson was still alive. The
doctors had taken one look and ordered him not to be touched, not
even for X-rays. Henry had put three loads of No. 5 shot in his
belly from a distance of a few yards. Adrenna was my greatest
concern. I found her, and usually so careful not to touch me with
her clean brown hands, she threw herself on me. She must stay in
town, I told her, to be near the hospital, and I would come again
the next day. The Mickens family has ramifications all over the
state and there was an aunt, Big Ham, with whom she could
stay.</p>

<p>Tom Glisson told me all that was known of the shooting. He had
heard the reports of the gun, then Adrenna's screams, and had run
down the road. He had loaded Samson into his truck and taken him
to town. Adrenna stood in the back of the truck like a Flying
Victory, shrieking all the way to Gainesville. Henry had given
Tom the gun and gone along with him peacefully to surrender. It
was a Sunday and Tom had combed the town for a sheriff, deputy or
policeman.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "there wasn't a piece of law in the
place."</p>

<p>He had bullied the hospital into taking in the wounded man,
had beaten on the door of the jail until he roused some one to
take in the meek and drooping Henry, and had given clues as to
where I might be located by telephone.</p>

<p>"I was sure tempted," he said, "to turn around and bring
everybody right back here to the Creek and nurse Samson and try
Henry our own selves."</p>

<p>Samson lived. Not even the doctors knew how he did it. He lay
for days, green-white and bleeding. Then suddenly he opened his
eyes when I went into his room, smiled weakly and announced that
we needn't worry about him. His time, he said, had not come to
die. The best explanation of his recovery was that his size had
saved him. The shot that would have gone entirely through a small
thin man, had largely embedded itself in his thick flesh. The
pellets began to roll out of him. Every time the nurse changed
his bed, she gathered up a handful. Some would stay in him as
long as he lived. My mind jumped ahead to the inevitable
repercussions. Henry would now face no murder or manslaughter
charge. At most, it would be assault with intent to kill; a few
years in the penitentiary. What would Samson do? Would he bide
his time, until Henry should emerge from jail? I sounded him out
cautiously one day. He held no malice toward Henry.</p>

<p>"Henry done wrong," he said simply. "But I forgive him."</p>

<p>He was most concerned about his hands and about my garden. His
big hands had caught a part of the load and it was doubtful
whether he would regain their use. He held up the thick
bandages.</p>

<p>"I jes' got to git these back," he said. "I been layin' here
thinkin' about the garden. Ain't nobody but me goin' to take keer
of it right. Them roses had ought to been fertilized yestiddy. I
figgered it up. I got to git back my hands."</p>

<p>I came away in tears. Something in the man's nature was truly
big. Then I realized with horror that for all my admiration I
still just didn't like Samson. The thought came to me that his
forgiveness was both bland and unnatural. What had he done to
provoke Henry? Adrenna was more enigmatic than ever. She stayed
with Big Ham and went three times a day to sit by her husband's
bed. But when I came on her sitting there, she was staring
blankly ahead of her, as though she sat as a duty by the
unmourned dead. I tried to draw her out about the shooting. She
was evasive. It had just happened, that was all. Henry was afraid
of Samson. Had Samson done anything to make him afraid? Henry was
just afraid. An unholy suspicion came to me that Adrenna the
flirt, Adrenna the butt-switcher, was back of it all. Was it
possible that she had egged Henry on? I shall never know.</p>

<p>Samson was ready to leave the hospital. His belly wounds had
healed and only his big hands were bandaged. With a few
operations on the remaining shot, he would recover their use. I
arranged to take him back for these. I was to get Adrenna at Big
Ham's and then we would pick up Samson.</p>

<p>"Big Ham want to meet you," Adrenna said. "She say she got
somethin' to say to you."</p>

<p>Big Ham's place was a neat little cottage on the outskirts of
Gainesville. I drove to the door. Adrenna waved. An enormous
black woman waddled toward my car. She walked with a fixed
purpose, a little ominously.</p>

<p>She shouted, "This the woman?"</p>

<p>I wondered if she blamed me for something, if she thought I
had not done enough, or had done it improperly. She reached the
car and leaned into the window and peered at me
belligerently.</p>

<p>"Look at me," she said.</p>

<p>I looked at her meekly.</p>

<p>"I want to look in your face," she said. "I want to look in
the face of the white woman has got such sympathy for the black
one."</p>

<p>Her voice softened.</p>

<p>"Say me your name."</p>

<p>I said it. I did not use the "Mrs.," as one does usually with
this race. I gave my full name as one does for a document. She
repeated it after me, accurately.</p>

<p>"I want to carry your name to the Lord," she shouted. "I gwine
pray for you. And when I carry your name, I want to carry it
straight, so the Lord know exactly who I mean."</p>

<p>She turned and strode back to her house. Adrenna got into the
car and we gathered up Samson at the hospital and we drove
home.</p>

<p>A story so full of black nobility should end idyllically. It
ended in complete confusion. The aftermath brought me into my one
conflict with Old Boss, who presumably had nothing to do with it.
Samson was back at the Creek. He wandered around for two weeks
while his hands healed, then went at the garden. He could use
them well enough to work around the rosebushes. I longed to like
him and could not. Then the question of Henry arose, like a ghost
materialized. All the Creek, it seemed, wanted Henry back. Sissie
and the babies were desolate. I sent them money secretly. I found
that I, too, wanted Henry back. But justice was justice, and
whether or no we loved Henry and could not love Samson, I decided
that justice should prevail. Meantime, the rest of the Creek
lined up solidly to stand with Henry.</p>

<p>I think it made me angry that they all went behind my back. If
they had come to me and told me that they wanted Henry, we might
have worked it out. There was Samson's lack of ill feeling to
take into consideration, and the fact that none knew what he and
Adrenna had done to provoke the attack. I was pushed into the
position of persecuting Henry, my favorite, in the name of
Samson, the stranger, and I loathed my situation. The next thing
I knew, Henry was free. He was reported camping across the Creek
where Sissie joined him of nights. He was afraid to come home and
face my vengeance, they told me. Adrenna rolled her eyes and was
noncommittal. I wanted to wring her scrawny neck. We were in this
mess because I had trusted her to get us our man, and now I was
left holding the bag, the whole Creek lined up against me. Samson
was terrified, or pretended to be.</p>

<p>"That man aims to finish me," he said, but there was a false
note in the way he said it.</p>

<p>I went to the sheriff's office to make inquiries. The sheriff
was bland. Henry had been let out of jail for lack of evidence. I
did not see what more evidence a court of law could require than
three loads of No. 5 shot in an unarmed man's belly. I pressed
the sheriff and threatened to take the matter to the state's
attorney and the governor. The truth came out. Old Boss had gone
to the judge, a lifelong friend, and had told him, simply, that
Henry was his man and he wanted him released. The judge released
him. That was all there was to it. All, except that now I was
aroused, and felt that I could not allow so flagrant a
miscarriage of justice to transpire.</p>

<p>I swore out a new warrant for Henry's arrest. The sheriff
hedged, for Old Boss and the judge antedated me. He could not
find Henry, he said. I told him where Henry might be found, and
on threat of exposing the sheriff himself, Henry was promptly
found and clapped back into jail to await trial on charges of
assault with intent to kill. It was an unhappy time at the Creek,
and I was the most miserable of all. Nobody wanted Samson, for
all his virtues, and everybody, myself included, wanted Henry,
for all his faults. But justice was justice and my dander was up.
I grieved for Sissie and sent her more money. Martha shared the
opprobrium heaped on me, for it was believed she had put me up to
my cruelties. Actually, she was on Henry's side, too. She
received anonymous letters, threatening her life if she stayed at
the Creek. We do not know to this day who sent them, but they
came from Henry's cohorts. Martha would have stayed it out, but
Old Will got in a panic and they moved to Gainesville.</p>

<p>Henry languished in jail, from which he wrote Sissie. Adrenna
presumably stood with me on the side of right, and she stole the
letter and brought it to me, for her honor was now involved as
well as mine.</p>

<p>"My dear sweet wife. When the trial comes up, you are to
testify that Samson threatened me. Just forget what happened, and
say that Samson come at me and I had to shoot in
self-defense."</p>

<p>Back of Henry, as I found, was a lawyer hired by Old Boss and
Tom Glisson. I was angrier than ever. Then Martha slipped back to
the Creek to see me.</p>

<p>"Sugar," she said, "everybody want Henry back. Nobody don't
want Samson, especially Adrenna. You ask her."</p>

<p>I asked her. I was appalled.</p>

<p>"Samson jes' don't fit in at the Creek," she said. She burst
out, "The man 'bout to drive me crazy. I ain't never really liked
him. I figured he'd do for you and me, but he ain't. What do he
do? How do he spend the nights? He spend 'em drinkin' coffee and
quarrelin'. Please get rid of him for me--jes' this once."</p>

<p>I gave in to mass opinion at the Creek.</p>

<p>"Samson," I said, "you're not happy here, are you?"</p>

<p>"Might be," he said, "did Adrenna seem satisfied."</p>

<p>"But you and Adrenna aren't getting on together, are you?" I
persisted.</p>

<p>"No'm. Nobody couldn't say me and Adrenna is gettin'
along."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather be some place else?"</p>

<p>"Reckons I would. Cross Creek is the most queerest place and
the queerest people I've ever knowed."</p>

<p>I gave him a month's pay, with guilt and shame in my soul, and
Samson was gone. Adrenna thanked me profusely.</p>

<p>"I won't never make us a mistake like that again," she
said.</p>

<p>Meantime, Henry was in jail. Sissie came to me, babe in arms.
Martha came to me. Old Will came. Tom Glisson came to me.</p>

<p>"You know, all this trouble is really your fault," he
said.</p>

<p>I had felt that, too, but I did not know why.</p>

<p>"I figgered you'd learned your lesson from Kate and Raymond,
and them eatin' all your chickens and raisin' Cain on the
highway, but you ain't quite learned it. Don't you know that
truck of yours causes more trouble at the Creek than a dose of
smallpox?"</p>

<p>I said, "What has that to do with Henry?"</p>

<p>"You let Adrenna and Samson and Henry go off on that truck.
They got drunk and hard feelin's come up. Who's to blame for the
hard feelin's, I don't know, but I do know if there's trouble,
Adrenna's back of it. We want Henry here. Old Boss needs him to
work on his grove. The rest is up to you."</p>

<p>Henry's trial came off, as great a farce as could come before
a court of justice. I had decided what I must do, for peace at
the Creek is a vital matter. In a private courtroom, the judge
called us to order. Henry was represented by the lawyer. There
was no prosecuting attorney at all, the judge announcing that he
would act in that capacity. I was the first witness called, and
the entire population of Cross Creek leaned forward in its seats,
and may God forgive me, I said blandly that my testimony was of
no value, as I had not been present when the shooting occurred
and had my evidence only from hearsay. A long breath of relief
filled the courtroom. The lawyer stared at me. He called his
witnesses. The testimony was completely irrelevant. Bernie Bass,
a satellite at the moment of Tom Glisson, stood up blithely to
say that he had come down the road in time to hear Henry beg
piteously of Samson, "Don't you come any closer." Tom Glisson
took the occasion to express, with no bearing on the case, his
low and suspicious opinion of Adrenna.</p>

<p>"Judge, you can just bet she was back of it."</p>

<p>Adrenna rolled a baleful eye at him, and now that Samson was
safely away from the Creek, and Henry destined to be back again,
testified so noncommittally that one would have supposed her
merely to have passed by, a stranger, on the unfortunate
occasion. Samson, gazing mournfully at the steely Adrenna, told a
story less larded with imaginative fabrications. Yet back of him
were unsaid things. It came to me that I had never been in a
court of justice less touched by truth and honesty. Henry is a
born actor. He stood, a drooping picture of outraged innocence,
and told a story of the danger from Samson in which he had lived;
of his shooting at the last moment, when Samson strode toward him
with threats and in menace. The judge did not trouble to point
out that Henry had stolen Old Boss' shotgun some hours before
Samson had passed by; or that Samson had stood outside the gate
when Henry shot him. I longed to tear the farce to tatters, to
demand an authentic trial. Yet Sissie sat rocking the baby, and
Martha had told me that she was carrying another, and who would
look out for her? And paradoxically, for all of Henry's guilt, I
knew in my heart that he was not dangerous. A thing like this
would never happen again, and the social value of jail in any
case lies only in prevention. I sat still and heard the judge
announce that the case was dismissed, again, "for lack of
evidence."</p>

<p>I went up to him and said, "I've let this mockery go through
for reasons of my own. I just want you to know nothing has been
put over."</p>

<p>He sputtered, "I'll have you up for contempt of court."</p>

<p>"Oh no, you won't. You don't dare."</p>

<p>And he did not.</p>

<p>He said, "You understand, having signed the warrant, you are
responsible for the court costs."</p>

<p>I said, "I am not," and I never heard another word from the
matter.</p>

<p>The assembled witnesses listened, big-eyed. I gathered them
together outside in the corridor, Martha and Old Will, Henry and
Sissie, Adrenna, Tom Glisson and Bernie Bass and the lawyer.</p>

<p>I said, "Now we all know this has been as crooked a business
as the Creek ever got mixed up in. Samson is all right, but the
rest of you wanted Henry back. And if there's ever any trouble at
the Creek again, it won't ever reach a court. I'll take care of
it. And if there's any shooting, I'm going to do it."</p>

<p>We shook hands all around, and the lawyer asked me to support
him when he ran for the state legislature. The dove of peace flew
with us to the Creek and nested in the orange trees. Henry went
humbly about Old Boss' work, Sissie had her new baby, the hard
feeling against Martha's presumed intervention died down and Tom
Glisson intimated that it would be good to have old Aunt Martha
back with us again, and I built an addition to the tenant house
that is hers for life. Adrenna settled down again to the business
of finding a man who should suit both of us. I met Old Boss on
the road a few weeks later. At first I thought that our long
friendship had ended. Then he put out his hand to me and his blue
old eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"Next time," he said, "we'll talk things over."</p>

<p>Martha took great pride in the matter. Old Boss' son-in-law,
Mr. Williams, kept a vicious dog at the Creek.</p>

<p>Martha said, "Us got a new boss at the Creek. Boss o' Cross
Creek now is her--and Mr. Williams' Pat."</p>

<p>I wish sadly that I might report that Adrenna found us our
man. She worked hard at it. At last she decided that between us
we were undertaking too much. She would look out for herself and
I should have to do the same. Without warning, she eloped with a
brown youth half her age. She found too late that it had been a
mistake to let him know that she had a fortune of a hundred and
thirty dollars in postal savings. Robert had married her for her
money. When her wealth was gone, Robert was gone, too.</p>

<p>Martha had meantime been pulling her usual strings. She
announced that her favorite son, Little Will, was visiting
opportunely at Sissie's and would be charmed to have my job. We
moved Little Will smoothly into the job and the tenant house. A
left-over lettuce hand, Alberta, was staying there, too, for lack
of a place to go. In the Jeff Davis days, Jeff had brought her in
from a nearby town to set out our lettuce plants and when Jeff's
wife lured him back from Adrenna's clutches, Alberta was left
behind. It was natural that, with very little preliminary
courting, Little Will married the left-over lettuce hand. I had
an optimistic moment in which I thought I might train Alberta to
my work. But as soon as the homeless orphan for whom we had all
felt so sorry was safely married to a wage-earner, she announced
that her working days were over.</p>

<p>Martha, of course, filled in. She tried with all her wiles to
keep the job open until the inevitable day when Adrenna should
drift back home again. Much as I loved Adrenna, I could not look
forward happily to future man-hunts. There came to me, in answer
to prayer, a reward for my sufferings, the perfect maid. She is
well trained, as good a cook as I, well educated, with almost my
own tastes in literature and movies. She loves the country, she
loves my dog, she loves company dinners, she dislikes liquor and
has no interest in men. The Lord taketh away but the Lord also
definitely giveth. Blessed be the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>I expressed as much to Martha. She was at first obstructive.
When she hinted that I could not possibly be pleased by a girl
from Reddick, and advised me darkly not to spend money on
refurnishing her room, for she was certain not to be here long, I
knew that she was up to her old tricks of manipulation. I had not
won perfection to have it snatched from me, even by Martha. I
talked to her frankly and for the first and only time, brutally.
Idella was satisfied, I said, and I was more than satisfied with
her. I would keep her if it meant throwing every one else out.
Adrenna could not come back even if she wanted to. I played my
last card, and for once Martha did not see through me. If I could
not live comfortably at the Creek, I told her, I should sell my
grove to Yankees and move away. Martha gave up gracefully and
joined me in p&aelig;ans of praise for Idella.</p>

<p>I said, "You know what I've been through with maids. I feel
perfectly sure that the Lord sent me Idella."</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>"Reckon so, Sugar. The Lord stands high, but He sees low."</p>

<p>She meant, I think, that the Lord had seen through her.</p>

<p>If, even with the Lord on my side, providing Idella, I
imagined that Martha would allow Adrenna to pass from our lives,
the dream was fatuous. Martha has just brought Adrenna here for a
"visit." She showed up with a four months' old baby, of exactly
the right age to be a memento of the vanished Robert. This she
denies, quite simply. The baby was born to a neighbor, she said,
who was going to throw it away.</p>

<p>"I told 'em I'd raise it," Adrenna said, "rather than them
jes' throw it in the garbage."</p>

<p>Adrenna has been jobless since she left and she needs a major
operation.</p>

<p>"I decide I rather have the operation here," she said, "so's I
can be home, at the Creek."</p>

<p>I had a sinking sensation. The baby, Betty Jean, is bright and
ingratiating. I can see Martha behind the scenes, managing,
manipulating. I am doomed to pay for the operation and doomed to
help Adrenna raise the baby. Perhaps Martha is looking ahead to
the day when the Lord reaches down His hand to the Creek and
turns her over to Abraham's bosom. Perhaps she sees Adrenna
replacing her in the addition to the tenant house in her old age,
and Betty Jean serving me in mine. Martha will have a finger in
my pie from beyond the grave.</p>

<h2><a name="c17">17. <i>Our daily Bread</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I hold the theory that the serving of good food is the one
certain way of pleasing everybody. A Readers' Club, in
advertising its wares, advises one and all to turn to books when
love and liquor fail them. Love and liquor are admittedly
fallible comforters, but who is to agree on books? One man's meat
is another man's poison more certainly in literature than in
gastronomy. Conversation is fallible, for not all want to talk
about the same things, and some do not want to talk at all, and
some do not want to listen. But short of dyspepsia or stomach
ulcers, any man or woman may be pleased with well-cooked and
imaginative dishes.</p>

<p>Cookery is my one vanity and I am a slave to any guest who
praises my culinary art. This is my Achilles heel. Dorothy Parker
has a delightful verse dealing with the abuse she is willing to
take from her beloved, and ending, "But say my verses do not
scan, and I get me another man." For my part, my literary ability
may safely be questioned as harshly as one wills, but
indifference to my table puts me in a rage.</p>

<p>My recognition of cookery as one of the great arts was not an
original discovery, but it is as important a one for the
individual woman as the discovery of love. My mother and her
mother had been famous cooks. When I read Della Lutes' <i>A
Country Kitchen,</i> I wept in nostalgia for my Michigan
grandmother's dinner table. My mother was as great a cook, but
there was a taint on her art, for she did not consider it a
notable accomplishment and she refused to teach me. Also, she
worked so hard at it, with so little joy, no matter how capable a
maid stood at her side, that she was exhausted, with a migraine
headache, when a special feast was ready, and could not touch any
of the magnificent dishes. I watched her in the kitchen with
utter fascination, and since she apparently used no recipes, but
combined her inherited knowledge with her own natural gift, I
came to the secret conclusion that cooking was a matter of
instinct, and that surely it must be in my blood. This belief was
as fatuous as the belief of most people that they could write if
they cared to take the time for it.</p>

<p>My instinctive cooking proved, in my maturity, a thing of
horror. It bore no relation to that of my mother and my
grandmother. The climax was dual, two shocks following closely on
each other. One night at dinner a plate of tomato mayonnaise
salad was heaved at my head. There was nothing wrong with the
salad, but every other dish on the table was inedible. I began to
wonder if heredity might not be a snare and a delusion. A week
later my mother-in-law came to visit, and while she ate my meals
gracefully, courageously and without comment, she had no sooner
returned to her home than there came to me in the mail a copy of
the <i>Boston Cook Book</i>, even ahead of the conventional bread
and butter letter.</p>

<p>I was not offended, but grateful, and I studied Fanny Farmer
as a novitiate the prayer book. Lo and behold, my memories of my
mother's dishes suddenly fitted in with the new exactness and I
could duplicate her secret recipes, her heart-melting egg
croquettes, her chicken in aspic, her potato puffs, her white
almond cake. Science, art and instinct joined hands in a happy
ring-around-the-rosy. I had solid rock under me. I have often
thought that if I should be quite destitute, provided I had a
modicum of health, I should enjoy making my living as a cook, but
it would have to be in an establishment where the cream and
butter and cooking sherry were not stinted, for life at the Creek
with Jersey cows has unfitted me for skimmed milk and margarine.
And I should buy cooking sherry with my last dollar.</p>

<p>The new foods that I found in Florida were a challenge and I
have learned more about cookery in my years at the Creek than in
those that preceded them. Some of my best dishes are entirely
native and local and I shiver with delight when a stranger pokes
at something and asks dubiously, "What is it?" then, urged to
taste, is wreathed with smiles and says, "It's good, even if it's
rattlesnake." Rattlesnake is of course eaten as a delicate hors
d'oeuvre, but of all the queer things I have served or eaten,
this alone is not among them. It is sheer prejudice, no doubt,
but I know too well the heavy, rolling black and yellow bodies to
relish a morsel from their midriffs.</p>

<p>William Bartram gives a pertinent account of a similar
divergence of taste. The occasion was a trip to Florida, near St.
Augustine, with his father, the botanist John Bartram, at a much
earlier date than William's famous travels of 1773.</p>

<p>"Some time after we had been rambling in a swamp about a
quarter of a mile from the camp, I being ahead a few paces, my
father bid me observe the rattlesnake before and just at my feet.
I stopped and saw the monster formed in a high spiral coil, not
half his length from my feet: another step forward would have put
my life in his power, as I must have touched if not stumbled over
him. The fright and perturbation of my spirits at once excited
resentment; at that time I was entirely insensible to gratitude
or mercy. I instantly cut off a little sapling, and soon
dispatched him: this serpent was about six feet in length, and as
thick as an ordinary man's leg. The encounter deterred us from
proceeding on our researches for the day. So I cut off a long
tough withe or vine, which fastening round the neck of the slain
serpent, I dragged him after me, his scaly body sounding over the
ground, and entering the camp with him in triumph, was soon
surrounded by the amazed multitude, both Indians and my
countrymen. The adventure soon reached the ears of the commander,
who sent an officer to request that, if the snake had not bit
himself, he might have him served up for his dinner. I readily
delivered up the body of the snake to the cooks, and being that
day invited to dine at the governor's table, saw the snake served
up in several dishes; governor Grant being fond of the flesh of
the rattlesnake. I tasted of it, but could not swallow it."</p>

<p>At the Creek I was obliged to learn all over again the simple
matter of "bread." Bread to me had always been the baked wheat
loaf, white or of the whole grain. One drew a line only between
homemade and baker's bread. This is not "bread" to the Creek at
all. If I asked a neighbor for some bread in an emergency, I
should receive a pan of cornbread. It is the staple bread and the
young Townsends were correct in believing that one must have it
to grow on. Bread as I once knew it is called "light bread," and
healthy appetites despise it for "wasp's-nest bread," with
contempt for its texture and its filling qualities. There are
gradations of cornbread. True cornbread is made elegantly with
milk and eggs and shortening and is considered, rightly, good
enough for any one. Then comes cornpone. It is not so rich,
leaving out the eggs and usually the milk, and is made in a
skillet on top of the stove. Below cornpone is hoe-cake and this
is made simply of cornmeal, salt and water, very thin in texture,
and fried in a skillet if one has fat for frying, or often in a
Dutch oven or over a hearth or camp fire. The field hands of
slavery times and the soldiers in the War Between the States
baked it on a shovel or hoe held to the open flame. When made of
good sweet water-ground meal, it is crisp and palatable, much
like Mexican corn-chips.</p>

<p>I do not know where, among the cornbreads, to place
hush-puppies. There are elevated Floridians who turn up their
noses at hush-puppies, but any huntsman would not exchange a
plate of them for cr&ecirc;pes suzettes. They are made and served
only in camp, or when one is frying fresh-caught fish informally
at home, with the returned fishermen clustered comfortably in the
kitchen while the cook works. Hush-puppies have a background,
which is more than many fancy breads can claim. Back of them is
the hunt, the fishing trip, the camaraderie, the grease in the
Dutch oven aromatic to hungry sportsmen. First, you fry your
pristine fish, boned and filleted, rolled in fine cornmeal and
salt and dropped into sizzling fat. You lift out the fish,
golden-brown, and lay them on pie plates close to the camp fire.
While they have been frying, you have stirred up your mixture:
fine white cornmeal, salt, a little soda or baking powder, an egg
or two or three if the camp be affluent, and, if you want
hush-puppies de resistance, finely chipped raw onion. You make
the mixture dry and firm. You pat it into little cakes or
croquettes between your hands and drop the patties into the
smoking deep fat in which the fish have been fried. They brown
quickly to the color of winter oak leaves, and you must be sure
to have your coffee and any other trifles ready, for when the
hush-puppies are brown, your meal is ready.</p>

<p>They must be eaten so hot that they burn the fingers that lift
them, for the licking of fingers, as with the Chinese genius who
discovered roast pig, is the very best of it. Do they sound
impossible? I assure you that under the open sky they are so
succulent that you do not care whether you have the rest of your
dinner or not. The name? It came, old-timers say, from hunting
trips of long ago, when the hunters sat or stood around the camp
fire and the Negro cooks and helpers sweat over their cooking and
the hunters ate lustily. And although the hunting dogs tethered
to nearby trees had been fed their evening meal, they smelled the
good smells of man's victuals, and tugged at their leashes, and
whined for a tid-bit extra. Then cook or helper or huntsman would
toss the left-over little corn patties to the dogs, calling,
"Hush, puppies!" And the dogs bolted the toothsome morsels and
hushed, in their great content.</p>

<p>The hot biscuit runs a poor second to cornbread, but is
considered of higher social caste. We abrogate and deprecate
corn-bread when we have guests, but we should consider ourselves
deficient in hospitality if we served a company meal without hot
biscuits. We cannot conceive of a guest's not relishing them, and
a tale is told of a visitor to the South who never got to taste a
hot biscuit, solely from his hostess' zeal in trying to provide
them hot. It seems that the visitor was a great
conversationalist, and as the hot biscuits were passed him by the
maid, he would take one, butter it, and delve into talk. He would
pause, reach for his biscuit, and the hostess would say, "Oh, but
that one is cold. You must have a hot one." She would ring for
fresh biscuits, the guest would take one and butter it, make
conversation, and again, his biscuit would be snatched from him
as he was about to eat it. The story goes that he left the South
without ever having tasted a hot southern biscuit. It sounds like
one of Irvin Cobb's yarns, but it is more than plausible. We do
not have here the beaten biscuit of Kentucky, but we make our
biscuits much shorter than northern biscuits, and while I
sometimes think longingly of my mother's and grandmother's
biscuits, light, flaky, falling apart in layers, I bite into a
Florida biscuit, crisp as Scotch shortbread, and no longer recall
my ancestry. The sorriest Negress, who can turn out nothing else
fit to eat, can make hot biscuits that would have melted the hard
heart of Sherman.</p>

<p>We have a wonderful recipe in these parts for ice-box rolls,
whose yeast-rising dough may be prepared in advance, kept in the
icebox, and brought out to be raised and baked when needed. It is
perhaps exceptional or local only in that we bake it by
preference in a Dutch oven with live coals for heat. Cast iron is
so superior for cooking utensils to our modern aluminum that I
not only cannot grieve for the pioneer hardship of cooking in
iron over the hearth, but shall retire if necessary to the back
yard with my two Dutch ovens, turning over all my aluminum
cookers for airplanes with a secret delight. The Parker House in
its hey-day could not have made rolls as good as those we make on
camps in the Dutch oven. I make the rolls a trifle larger than is
usual and tuck them in tightly in their buttered iron nest. I put
on the heavy cover and set the oven with its three short legs
either within faint warming distance of the camp fire, or out in
the sun. The heat for baking, when they have risen and are ready
in an hour or so, must be handled as carefully as a munitions
plant handles its powder. Too little heat in baking means pale
wan doughy rolls, and too much means rolls of charcoal. Only
experience teaches the number and depth of hot glowing oak coals
both under the oven and on the lid. When properly done, the rolls
are light as feathers, done to a great flakiness, hazel-nut
brown, and of a flavor achieved under no other circumstances.</p>

<p>My most successful Dutch oven rolls were prepared in the
middle of the St. John's River. The doctor and his wife Dessie
and I were on a fishing trip on a warm winter day down the
Ocklawaha River to its junction with the St. John's, through
little Lake George, to the mouth of Salt Springs Run, where we
planned to cook supper and camp for the night. I had brought
along my large Dutch oven and a big bowl of dough for my rolls.
We fished late into the afternoon and it was plain that by the
time we reached our camping place, it would be too late to set my
dough to rise. There would be time enough for the baking, for the
fish must be cleaned and fried. We estimated the time to the
landing, and an hour and a quarter beforehand, I brought out my
bowl of dough, my extra flour, my butter and my Dutch oven from
under a seat of the row-boat, and while spray from the wind-swept
river dashed into my face, I mixed the dough in the bowl in my
lap, shaped my rolls and placed them tenderly in the Dutch oven.
I put the oven far forward where the late afternoon sun would
rest on the lid, and by the time we reached Salt Springs Run and
the camp fire was built, the rolls had risen and were ready for
the baking. They had never been so delicious. Supper was superb,
the fresh-caught bass white and sweet and firm, the coffee strong
and good as it can only be in the open.</p>

<p>We were on a little promontory at the mouth of the run, with
great live oaks around us, and palms tall against the aquamarine
evening sky. A full moon rose in front of us and we felt
ourselves favored of all mortals. After so much delight, we might
have expected to pay the piper. The night was hideous. Because
the time was winter, we had assumed there would be no mosquitoes.
But because the winter was warm, they had hatched, and as we lay
on blankets on the sand, they descended in swarms. We built up
the camp fire to make smoke to drive them away and the smoke was
more annoying than the mosquitoes. Hoot owls settled in the oaks
over our heads and cried jeeringly all night. Wood roaches came
in and awakened us from our spasms of slumber with their sharp
nibbling on our ears. When we arose at dawn, the doctor said,
"You know, the only thing that kept me going through the night
was remembering those rolls."</p>

<p>Florida vegetables are all found, I think, in northern
markets, but many of them are never cooked properly there, for
the reason that the Yankee does not understand the benign uses of
white bacon. When you say "meat" in the north, you mean beef or
lamb or something of the sort. "Meat" in Florida is one
thing--white bacon. We call it white bacon to distinguish it from
breakfast bacon, or side meat, and it is, simply, salt pork, or,
to the army, sow belly. If it is under-rated in the north and by
the military, it is perhaps over-rated in Florida, for it is the
staple meat. Affluent rural families serve it three times a day,
no matter what other meats may be on the table, poor families
have it as often as they can afford it, and town families of
rural antecedents serve it when the nostalgic hunger becomes too
great. The other evening I found my colored maid Idella laughing
to herself in the kitchen. I inquired the source of her
mirth.</p>

<p>"Guess what I had for my supper," she said.</p>

<p>I could not guess.</p>

<p>"Well, I had cornpone and white bacon. When we were growing up
and there were so many of us in the family, all we had most of
the time was cornpone and white bacon, and we had to eat it or go
hungry. I thought I'd just like to see how it tasted when I
didn't have to eat it."</p>

<p>It tasted very good indeed, she reported.</p>

<p>White bacon is cooked everywhere in about the same fashion. It
is usually soaked a little while in warm water or in milk,
squeezed dry, dipped in flour and fried to a crisp golden brown.
The large amount of grease that fries from it is poured into a
bowl and this to the backwoodsman is "gravy." It is solid grease,
and it is poured over grits, over sweet potatoes, over corn-bread
or soda biscuits, and how country stomachs survive ten hundred
and ninety-five servings of this a year is a mystery past my
solving.</p>

<p>But the bacon itself is very tasty and is a requirement in
cooking many vegetables. I cannot conceive of cow-peas without a
few thin slices boiled along with them, and even string beans,
which here we call green beans or wax beans according to color,
now seem insipid to me when cooked with butter or even with
cream. "Greens" probably save more backwoods lives than the
doctors, for they are the one vegetable, aside from cow-peas, for
which country folk have a passion. Spinach as a green is unheard
of, although it is raised for the northern market. Beet greens
are not relished. But turnip greens, mustard greens and above
all, collard greens, cooked with white bacon, with cornbread on
the side, make an occasion. Pot liquor and corn-bread have their
adherents and have even entered into southern politics, a man
addicted to the combination being able to claim himself a man of
the people.</p>

<p>Mustard greens are strong and hot and are best used sparingly
along with turnip greens. Wherever mustard has been planted, it
goes wild and spreads, so that today, ten years after my last
planting, I can still go down toward the lake under the old
seedling pecan trees and pick a good mess in season. Collard
greens are my favorite of the three. They have a sweet nutty
flavor. An unhappy combination is collard greens and hog
chitlings. Rural Florida is divided into chitling and
anti-chitling camps and feeling sometimes runs high. Man stands
against wife and mother against child. Fred Tompkins solved the
dissension over them between himself and his wife in a practical
way.</p>

<p>"The Old Hen's a fool for chitlin's," he said, "and I don't
believe in deprivin' another of anything they call pleasure. So
when she cooks 'em, I just sell out and leave home for a day or
two."</p>

<p>Pokeweed flourishes here and in late winter or early spring
the broad-leaved green shoots spring up all over the grove.
Others at the Creek use the leaves for "poke salat," or cook them
like any other greens. I hunt through the grove after a spring
rain, basket in hand, for the most tender shoots, cutting those
from six to eight inches in length. I trim off the leaves and
thin skin and cook the shoots exactly as I do asparagus, serving
them on buttered toast with a rich cream sauce poured over, and
strips of crisp breakfast bacon around them. The flavor is
delicate and delicious, with a faint taste of iron.</p>

<p>Longing for asparagus, I imported a quantity of the roots and
made a deep rich bed according to instructions. The asparagus
grew and thrived, but the year-round blandness of temperature
here, with no long dormant period, excited it so violently that
it grew twelve months of the year, sending up long neurotic
shoots every night, no larger than a bridge pencil. It grew so
fast that there was never a moment of that crisp succulence in
which to cut it. By noon the thin sprigs had burst into ferny
leaf. I was discouraged, but I think the asparagus was not, for
after generations of offering damp heads to a cold northern April
sky, here were sun and heat all day long, and the asparagus went
wild with joy.</p>

<p>Okra is a Cinderella among vegetables. It lives a lowly life,
stewed stickily with tomatoes, or lost of identity in a Creole
gumbo. I do not know whether the magic wand with which I wave it
into something finer than mere edibility is original, but I know
no other cook who serves it as I do. To bring it to its glamorous
fulfillment, only the very small tender young pods must be used.
These are left with the stem end uncut and are cooked exactly
seven minutes in rapidly boiling salted water. I serve them
arranged like the spokes of a wheel on individual small plates,
with individual bowls of Hollandaise sauce set in the center. The
okra is lifted by the stem end as one lifts unhulled
strawberries, dipped in the Hollandaise and eaten much more
daintily than is possible with asparagus. The flavor is unique.
The Hollandaise, it goes without saying, must be perfect; just
holding its shape; velvety in texture; properly acid. I use the
yolk of one egg, the juice of half a lemon, and a quarter of a
pound of Dora's butter per person. The only other place I have
eaten Hollandaise as good as mine is at the Ritz-Carlton, and
even theirs does not have quite enough lemon juice to suit me.
And of course, for the price of one serving of broccoli or
asparagus &agrave; la Hollandaise at the Ritz, I can buy a whole
hamper of okra and feed Dora for a week.</p>

<p>The Ritz and the Waldorf and such haunts also serve our most
exotic vegetable. They call it hearts of palm, but to us at the
Creek it is, simply, swamp cabbage. I serve it seldom, for it is
truly the heart of a palm tree and the epicure's feast means the
death of a palmetto. I am so enamored of the tall swaying palms
that I cut one only on special occasions, although it makes one
of my favorite dishes. You cannot have your palm tree and eat it
too. Only the young palms have edible hearts. The proper height
is about six or eight feet. It is a yeoman's job to cut down the
tough fibrous trunk and split off the overlapping tight outer
layers. I do not see how any one gets the white inner cylinder
trimmed down correctly, wasting none of the sweet portion but
cutting away all that will be strong and bitter, without Martha's
assistance. If she is within hailing distance, she comes to do
the job for me. Greed snares me when I try it, for I can never
give up the final layer, in the fond hope that it will prove
edible. A trace of bitterness spoils the dish. The tenderest core
of the wax-white cylinder may be sliced very thin, soaked in ice
water, drained and served as a salad with tart mayonnaise or
French dressing. It has the crisp sweetness of chestnuts. We
usually parboil our swamp cabbage in a very little water, then
put it on to cook again in still less water, with thin slices of
white bacon. It melts in your mouth when cooked with butter until
tender and dry, then moistened and heated with heavy cream. Its
flavor is a cross between oyster plant and boiled French
chestnuts, but as superior to either as angel food to hard
tack.</p>

<p>We raise here successfully an ethereal relation of the squash
family, the choyote. The fruitlike vegetable grows on a luxurious
vine that has been known to cover an acre. I used it through a
hot summer for shade over my Mallard duck pen. The choyote is the
shape of a blunt, enormous pear, pale jade-green in color.
Peeled, sliced, parboiled and tapered off au gratin in the oven
with a dense cream sauce and a nicely calculated quantity of
grated cheese, it provides so delicate a dish that I should
consider it suitable only for Boston Brahmins, if it were not
that Boston Brahmins have a rank and plebeian taste for baked
beans, coarse brown bread and odorous fish cakes.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the fabled Britisher who ate a breakfast,
which included codfish cakes, at the old Parker House in
Boston.</p>

<p>"All the dishes served me," he said to the waiter, "have been
exceptionally palatable. But will you kindly remove these little
patties? Something seems to have died in them."</p>

<p>Perhaps the delicacy of the choyote is after all most suited
to the sub-tropics, where we do everything in so leisurely a
manner that we roll a taste on our tongues and savor any subtle
flavor with the long view of time.</p>

<p>Here at the Creek we do not have our full quota of Florida
fruits, for we are above the frost line, as far north, actually,
as citrus may be raised commercially. The two large lakes, Orange
and Lochloosa, between which our lands lie, protect us from a
greater cold damage. We cannot raise here the avocado, the papaya
or the mango, and when I buy them in market I must pay almost as
much as in New York City. A hundred miles south all three are
raised, though for the fine big Haydn mango one must go south of
Miami and to the Florida Keys. I once planted three avocados, or
alligator pears, as the Chamber of Commerce wishes us to call
them, in pots. They grew into handsome seedlings with large
bronzed leaves and I set them out between the pump stand and the
pantry window, where the southern exposure would protect them.
They grew higher than the house and just as I had dreams of
grafting them with cuttings of the edible avocado, a freeze cut
them to the ground. They put out hopeful shoots for the next two
years, but last winter's cold finished them and there are three
black stumps to mark the site of my hopes for my own salads.</p>

<p>The papaya is not properly appreciated away from home, for the
reason that it is seldom served ripe enough. It must look
completely rotten, black and yellow, with the skin peeling from
it in apparent decay, before it is sweet and mellow and ready,
and it would not occur to any one out of the tropics to wait for
such disintegration. There should also be a minor law compelling
its dressing with lime juice. The fruit alone is on the insipid
side. The only recommendation for the over-sweetened canned
papaya juices is their vitamins and their digestive action on
proteins.</p>

<p>Better men than I have written lyrically about the mango. They
have also written, to my notion, abusively, for they insist that
the only way to eat a mango is in a bathing suit by the side of
the ocean or in the bathtub. This maligns the mango. It is
necessary only to tie a towel around one's neck and lean far
forward. If it could be had in no other way, it would be worth
while to stand on one's head to eat it or to hang from the limb
of a tree. I have known the best of northern apples in my
grandfather's orchard, the Ben Davis, the sheep's nose, the
banana apple, the little pink-stained snow apple, sweet as honey.
I have known the New York State Elberta peach and the Georgia
peach, the West Virginia sickle pear and the Wisconsin Bartlett.
I know the Indian River orange and its close rival, the pineapple
orange of my own section; our choice grapefruit and tangerines. I
would swap them all for the season's Haydn mangoes. There is a
smaller mango, fibrous and acrid, that we call the turpentine
mango from its strange flavor. This should be avoided unless one
is desperate for any taste of mango. The Haydn is born generously
with several different flavors, and we choose from the strawberry
mango, the pineapple mango and the peach mango.</p>

<p>Tastes and odors can never be described unless they are
comparable with known tastes and odors and the mango is unique
and completely superior. It may be peeled and eaten out of hand,
gnawing at last on the great pit; it may be cut daintily and
served just so, or with sugar and cream; or it may be made, with
the help of a Jersey cow, into ice cream fit for the gods. Do not
desecrate it, do not commit sacrilege, by making ice cream of the
mango with ordinary city cream, not even the double whip. If you
do not own a Jersey cow or have no friend who owns a Jersey cow,
eat your mango plain and forget the Olympus beyond your reach.
But if you can lay hold of cream as yellow as June butter, so
thick you must dip it from bowl or pitcher with a spoon, then
crush your mangoes, add a little lemon juice and a little sugar,
stir in the cream, freeze it, not in the electric icebox but in a
hand churn, and be prepared to have life afterward, without mango
ice cream, a trifle dull.</p>

<p>I recall the time when I was in the hospital on a bland, or
non-fibrous, diet. My own doctor, who had committed me to the
diet, knew that I shared his passion for mangoes. About eight
o'clock at night, when the day nurses had gone and the night
nurses were busy, he would slip into my room with a sack of
mangoes. He would close the door stealthily, bring me a towel and
basin, and peel a mango for me, then peel one for himself over
the lavatory. We ate mango for mango, and if there was an odd
number, he divided the extra one mathematically between us. I
would try to sift out between my teeth as much of the fiber as
possible.</p>

<p>"Anything this good," he would whisper over his shoulder,
fearful of the nurses whom he had impressed with the exigencies
of my diet, "couldn't possibly hurt any one."</p>

<p>To compensate a little for not being able to raise our own
mangoes at the Creek, we have guava bushes along almost every
fence row. Guavas have the rankness of odor of the tropics,
deathly sweet and pungent, and the uncouth say that a
self-respecting cat will bury a guava. The flavor, however, like
that of many malodorous cheeses, is delicate. The bushes grow
sometimes as high as a one-storied house and the fruit is borne
in round golden balls the size of small peaches. There are two
layers of solid meat, interspersed with countless small, hard,
yellow seeds like bleached buckshot. True guava addicts eat seeds
and all, and the sound of two or three of them at it is like the
clashing of worn gears. The Florida stores carry Florida-canned
guavas, but these have the seeds left in. The Cubans can the
seeded layers of large choice guavas in a heavy syrup, so
whenever I am in Tampa I go down into the crowded Cuban quarter,
redolent of scorching coffee beans and the long sweet sticks of
Cuban bread, and buy canned guavas there. I serve them with
cream, or with crackers and cream cheese. For making guava jelly,
I have a line of Cattley guava bushes along the edge of my back
porch. The bushes are as ornamental as ligustrum and the tiny red
fruits, as inedible as wild crabapples, as full of pectin and
tartness, make a ruby-red jelly much superior in taste and
texture to the commercial guava jelly. A glass of Cattley guava
jelly works miracles in a wine and raisin sauce for baked ham, in
a mince pie, and in a certain rum and brandy Christmas punch.</p>

<p>I tried futilely to make jelly of our passion fruit, which
sprawls its exquisite lacy vines all over the east grove through
the late summer. Among the truncated leaves the passion flower
opens pale lavender rosettes, fringed and marked at the center
with the stigmata, and with stamens indicating the number of the
apostles. There is even visible the crown of thorns. The fruit
resembles a little the May apple, but is of an open, fibrous
texture. There is a passion fruit liqueur that is the primary
ingredient, after the varied rums, of that marvelous and deadly
drink, the Zombie, and I was sure I had heard of passion fruit
jelly. My own vines in the grove had been destroyed by the last
mowing, and I walked two miles to Big Hammock where the vines
grew along the roadside. I gathered a skirtfull of the fruit and
went home to my experiment. Perhaps I should have eliminated the
skin or the seeds, but at any rate the exotic jelly on which I
had set my heart did not materialize. The mixture jellied, but it
tasted like a medi&aelig;val poison, acrid and strange, and I
threw it out with horror. There are several tropical edibles that
are poisonous when improperly treated, notably the coontie palm
root and the cassava. Both must be soaked and pounded to get rid
of the poisonous element. The coontie palm root when treated
makes a starchy flour for bread, and the reason the Seminole
Indians were able to hold out against us, was their use of the
root. The treated cassava root makes a delicious pudding, amber
in color, translucent, delicately sweet.</p>

<p>There are two jellies here, however, rare and ethereal, that,
like the wines of some provinces, may be found only in their own
habitat and are not on any market. One is the roselle, rosy-pink,
tasting like candied rose petals. The roselle belongs to the okra
and cotton and hollyhock family, and when the flowers, which we
raise for ornaments, are just past full bloom, we make the jelly
of the seed pods that have begun to form, seed pods that resemble
rose hips. The other is may-haw or hawthorn jelly, as delicate as
its name. I first tasted it, incongruously, on a bear hunt near
the St. John's River. Marsh Harper brought it, of his wife's
making, as part of his contribution to the hunt's food supplies.
It is necessary to pick the may-haws at the immediate moment of
proper ripeness, for if unripe they are bitter, and if over-ripe
they will not "jell."</p>

<p>Of the wild fruits, the large single wild Florida grape and
the wild plum, or hog plum, make the finest of tart jellies, and
I make these to serve through the winter with game. But I am
obliged to watch the development of the fruits closely and pick
them a trifle green, for the 'coons and 'possums and jay-birds
are likely to be ahead of me. I feel sometimes in gathering them
that I am stealing from the needy, for the jelly is a luxury for
me and the fruit a necessity for the small animals. I take no
more than I am sure I shall use. As for the pawpaws, which bloom
like miniature white orchids late in February, the banana-like
fruit is gone down the gullets of the varmints long before I have
had a chance at it, and with pawpaws covering our woods, I have
never tasted one.</p>

<p>Martha said to me, "Only a nigger young un kin beat the
varmints to the pawpaws."</p>

<p>Thinking of the small hungry creature faces, prowling for food
of nights, I have never picked a spray of pawpaw bloom, for all
its loveliness, but once, and that was to take to my artist
friend Robert for his enchantment. I wrote this verse once, after
I had held my hand:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did not break the may-haw bough,<br>
 Nor pull the flowering plum,<br>
 For ripe fruit follows April's plow<br>
 And falls when locusts drum,<br>
 And windy summer nights I know<br>
 New-weaned raccoons will come.<br>
<br>
 I left the fox the pawpaw bud<br>
 To ripen near his lair--<br>
 But brambleberries strewed the wood,<br>
 And they had bloom to spare.<br>
 I picked a thorny spray and stood<br>
 And tucked it in my hair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I am the sole admirer of my verse, but I felt a great nobility
during its composition.</p>

<p>The Scuppernong grape is not a Florida native, but cuttings
from old Carolina and Georgia vines have been brought in with
many a covered wagon and on many an ox-cart. The vine thrives
here in the dry sandy soil, and on many abandoned clearings,
where even the brick chimneys have fallen into dust, a huge
Scuppernong will stand, seeming to support the rotten lattice
work rather than to be sustained by it, an echo of some dead and
gone family struggle for existence. The purple Scuppernong is
rich and fat and unexceptional, but the white Scuppernong, in the
hands of loving and expert care, makes a vintage white wine that
can stand with the best Sauterne.</p>

<p>When Zelma and I were taking the census, we came on an old man
far off in the piney-woods who gave us cups of white Scuppernong
wine so dry, so fine, that I could not believe my palate. He gave
us the recipe, and I took it down as he dictated:</p>

<p>"Now don't look to this not to fail you if you don't do like I
tell you. And when I've done told you all I know, then you still
got to have a sort o' feelin' about it, and if you ain't got that
feelin', you just as good go buy your wine some'eres, for you
cain't make it.</p>

<p>"Now you mash your Scuppernongs the very same day you pick
'em. Don't you go pickin' 'em of an evenin' when the sun's low
and the day's coolin', and then you go traipsin' off some'eres,
sayin', 'I'll start my wine come mornin'.' You pick 'em fust off
in the mornin', with the dew on 'em, and you mash 'em with a
bread roller. Put 'em in a deep crock. A keg? Well, yes, I've
used a keg, but a crock's better. Now you sprinkle sugar or honey
over 'em. How much? Now I cain't no more tell you that than why a
bird sings. Just sort of kiver 'em light-like, and honey's the
best. I'd say flat-woods honey. Palmeeter honey is a mite too
dark. Now you let 'em stand three to seven days. I cain't tell
you which, nor what day in betweenst. They git a certain
look.</p>

<p>"Now some folks, when that time comes, skim off the pummies.
That ain't my way, and you kin do as you please. When that time
comes, I put 'em in a flour sack and I squeezes hell outen 'em.
Then I put the juice back in the crock and I add sugar slow,
powerful slow, stirrin' all the time. How much sugar? Now if you
like your wine sweet, you put the sugar to the juice until a
egg'll float. I don't fancy it that sweet. I like wine to lay
cool and not sickly on my tongue. I put in sugar to where a egg
don't quite float, to where it sort o' bobbles around, and mebbe
just raises itself oncet almost to the top.</p>

<p>"Now some folks leaves it lay in the crock. I don't. I put it
right now in the bottles, without no tops on. I keep some back in
the crock. I kiver the bottles with a cloth. The wine'll work,
and it'll shrink down, and ever' mornin' come sun-up I'll add
some from what I've helt back in the crock. I do this until it
quits workin'. Then I cork it tight and lay it down on its side
in a dark place. Now that ain't the way of a heap o' folks, but
it's my way."</p>

<p>I have never tried his recipe, because I have never had enough
white Scuppernongs at any one time to work with.</p>

<p>When the winter at the Creek has not been too cold, we have
our own bananas. Martha fries the coarse horse-banana and calls
it edible, but it has singularly little flavor. The tiny
lady-finger bananas are almost as sweet as the commercial sort
and in the rare years when a banana blossom appears, I nurse and
watch it through the summer. My plants make a man-high cluster
beside the wash-bench and the black women are grateful for the
shade of the broad leaves. The blossom is exotic past
description, so that only Georgia O'Keefe could do it justice
with her brush and palette. It is a ruddy maroon in color,
yellow-tipped, and a hundred fingerlike flowerets are the
forerunners of the long upside-down bunch of fruit. It is
necessary to cut the spray before the bananas are quite mature
and to hang it in a dark place. The fruit ripens and yellows
slowly in the store-room back of my kitchen.</p>

<p>It grieves me that we are too far north to raise the truly
tropical plantain, blood-brother to the banana. In late summer I
haunt the fruit stores, watching for the stalks of fruit that
must be as black as a bat before it is ready to use. The plantain
is peeled like a banana, sliced lengthwise very thinly, and fried
in butter, sugar being sprinkled over the slices as they are
turned in the skillet. It is suitably served with, say, fried
chicken, or alone as a dessert.</p>

<p>All my life the pomegranate has held for me a magical
connotation, for the story of Proserpine, daughter of Ceres, had
enchanted me as a child. No explanation of the seasons has since
seemed as plausible as the tale that told of the swallowing of
the forbidden pomegranate seeds by the child of Mother Earth,
condemned to spend, for every seed, a month in the underworld
while the earth sorrowed. When a neighbor gave me a thin rooted
twig of the bush, it was as though an ancient wand had been put
in my hand. I nursed the small thing until it grew lean and
feathery and as tall as the sloping roof by the kitchen door. In
its fourth spring it blossomed. The flowers are carved jewels,
strangely solid of calyx, made of polished carnelian that opens
out, not into petals, but a bright fluted mouth. The fruits are
ripe in September and vary in size from an orange to a small
grapefruit. This year they are so heavy that the roof-high
slender boughs are bent to the ground. Set in the fibrous, acrid
pulp is a nest of rubies, blood-red and transparent. These are
the seeds and it is their crisp casing that is edible. One's
teeth crack into it and it seems to splinter and melt away on the
tongue in a brief acid coolness. I scatter the bright shining
things across a pale fruit salad. I should not care to run the
risk of swallowing one, though probably the gods pay no attention
to us modern mortals and I could do so with impunity.</p>

<p>It is the meats that I prepare at the Creek that are the most
exotic of my dishes. I take no credit for some of them, for they
are old in local culinary lore. Alligator steaks, for instance.
It is no doubt absurd to balk at rattlesnake steaks and enthuse
over alligator, for the saurians are not much removed from the
reptiles. Drawing a line between dangerous rattlers and harmless
alligators is as though a cannibal said he would eat a friend but
would not eat an enemy. But surely we may all be allowed our
prejudices, and I have none against steaks from the tail of an
alligator. I can say dispassionately that properly cooked it is a
great delicacy. The meat is pink and clean, like veal, and is
similar in flavor. The first time I cooked it, I fried it too
long, and it was tough and dry. I discovered that it is like veal
cutlets or liver, in that it must be fried quickly, or simmered a
long time. It is best, pounded, drenched with flour and fried
rapidly in butter. Otherwise, it may be smother-fried, browned in
the fat, hot water and lemon juice added, covered, and allowed to
simmer until tender.</p>

<p>I am especially enthusiastic about our turtles, especially the
soft-shell cooter. We have four turtles, the gopher, or land
tortoise, which the Minorcans hunted for some unknown purpose,
perhaps medicinal; the hard-shell cooter; the soft-shell; and the
alligator cooter. At the Creek we have nothing to do with the
gopher, a hole-digger, an underminer of land, a provider of
refuge to the rattlesnake. As far as we know, he is not edible.
We are partial to the hard-shell cooter and I can never be in too
big a hurry on my way to town to stop the car and get out and
capture one to take home to Martha, with the proviso that she
save me some of the eggs, if it is a female, and a portion of the
meat. I learned to love the soft-shell cooter from Ed Hopkins. Ed
is gone from the earth he loved so well, but in his life he was a
country gentleman with the tastes and instincts of an Indian. He
announced that he would gather us a dinner directly from the
land, and we set out from the Creek one Sunday morning in early
summer.</p>

<p>"The Lord will provide," he said.</p>

<p>Rain threatened, and the turtles were crawling. They lay their
eggs ahead of a rain, so that no trace will be left to catch the
bright eyes of skunk or raccoon. We followed fresh trails and
came on our cooters in the act of laying. We took two sizeable
ones and part of the eggs, leaving the rest buried for seed. Our
entree then was to be turtle eggs, the turtle itself our meat
course. We cut a swamp cabbage, or palmetto, for one vegetable
and wild mustard greens for another. We gathered poke leaves for
a salad, to be dressed with the juice of wild oranges. We roamed
across a gallberry flat and found blueberry bushes waist high,
and picked our dessert into our hats.</p>

<p>"The Lord will provide," Ed repeated.</p>

<p>We made cornpone of our own meal, ground at the old water-mill
at Hawthorn. Dinner was cooked outdoors over the open fire. It
was a feast. For drink we had a pale dry yellow wine made of wild
elderberry blossoms.</p>

<p>The soft-shell cooter is cooked in the same manner as the
hard-shell, but more of it is edible. The preparation is the most
difficult part, as the separating of the meat from the shell
requires strength, patience and several implements. The meat is
then cut in small pieces, parboiled in salted water until tender,
then dipped in an egg batter and fried in deep sizzling fat. I
prefer it to fried chicken. The soft-shell cooter is a flat
fellow, like a flounder, an enormous brown pancake. The outer rim
of his shell is a soft gristle, and when prepared like the meat
itself, cooks to the texture of gum drops, and is of a flavor to
make you eat until you are weak and faint from surfeit.</p>

<p>The alligator cooter is the most highly prized of all inland
turtle meats. He is very dangerous, a virulent fighter encased in
a ridged, scaly shell from which he takes his name, with a fierce
hooked beak at the end of his head and long neck that can make
mincemeat of an enemy. While other turtles attempt to scramble
away, the alligator cooter lunges at you with incredible
swiftness, and when you have finally taken one, you have won a
small battle. The meat is whiter than that of the other turtles,
perhaps because of a difference in feeding habits, and is of a
less gamey taste and an even greater sweetness.</p>

<p>Turtle eggs, like chitlings, divide friend from friend, but to
my notion they are a major delicacy. Ed Hopkins proposed the
riddle, "Why does a hard-shelled cooter lay a soft-shelled egg,
and a soft-shelled cooter lay a hard-shelled egg?" I do not know
the answer, but the fact is there. The eggs taste exactly the
same, and also exactly like the larger eggs of the huge
sea-turtles that come to lay in summer on the Florida beaches. I
watched one of these monsters lay one night in front of my beach
cottage. She had already dug her deep, incurving nest and had
begun to lay when Norton and I discovered her. She heaved up and
down rhythmically. After an hour or more she was done, and packed
the sand hard with her back flippers. She turned her great body
laboriously and began a slow trek back to the ocean. She seemed
in no fear of us, and in the glow of our flashlight, looked at us
sadly, as though for sympathy, tears rolling from her eyes. I am
certain that they expressed no emotion, but only exhaustion. We
took turns riding her down to the water, then for all her bulk,
at least four feet each way, and weighing several hundred pounds,
felt that she must be too tired to carry any burden. We lifted
her hind legs and walked her wheelbarrow fashion, and she seemed
grateful for the assistance and took on a little burst of speed.
She lay for some minutes in the shallow water, recuperating; then
we saw the great dark form lift in the surf and head for the open
seas.</p>

<p>There were a hundred and thirty-five eggs in the nest, the
size of golf balls. The custom here also is to leave half of them
buried. In all three types of turtle eggs, the yolk is the
delicacy, the white being of a consistency that never hardens, no
matter how long the eggs are boiled in salted water. There is one
set way of eating turtle eggs, Ed Hopkins said, and an important
rite is connected with it. First you tear or break off the top of
the egg, holding it in your left hand as you operate with the
right. You add salt, pepper and a lump of butter. You pop the
yolk of the egg inside your mouth, and as you pop it is required
that you say solemnly, like a grace, "This is the most delicious
morsel God ever gave to man."</p>

<p>It was Ed too who taught me to make a fish chowder that makes
a poor thing of any New England chowder. Ed's was a virginal
chowder, uncorrupted by such alien elements as peas, corn and
tomatoes. I weaken now and then and serve large baked sea-bass or
red snapper with a Spanish sauce, but for fish chowder of a
pristine quality, I follow Ed's recipe. The fish of course may be
bought, but is immensely better when you have caught it yourself.
Any fish will do that is large enough to be boned and filleted.
Ed and I always preferred the big-mouthed bass of local waters.
In a Dutch oven by preference, or a deep iron skillet by second
choice, place a layer of finely cut white bacon or breakfast
bacon. On top of that lay gently a layer of boned fish. Place
above that a layer of thinly sliced raw peeled Irish potatoes and
a layer of thinly sliced raw white onion, and lastly, a layer of
soda crackers. Dot with butter and salt and pepper. Repeat the
layers in the same order until the cooking pot is filled. Add
water halfway to the height of the vessel, cover, and simmer
slowly until fish, onions and potatoes are tender. The liquid
must cook entirely away, so that the bottom layer of bacon bits
and fish is well browned. Add cream to cover, heat to boiling,
and serve immediately. You are not quite certain of what the dish
consists, for fish, onion and buttered cream are lost in a cosmic
delicacy. You know only that something almost too good for common
man is before you. And that reminds me of Ed's experience with
lump sugar when he was a little boy. Among the grocery stores
patronized by his family was one run by a Negro. Little Ed was
prowling about among the barrels of crackers, the cheeses, the
strings of smoked mullet, the hams, and came across a sack of
lump sugar.</p>

<p>He asked, "What's this, Uncle Ben?"</p>

<p>The Negro adjusted his spectacles.</p>

<p>"That, son," he said, "is a kind of sugar, used by a few white
folks and no niggers a-tall."</p>

<p>The expression has become a shibboleth among Ed's friends, and
we say of something special, like the chowder, "That's used by a
few white folks, and no niggers a-tall."</p>

<p>Under this classification comes one of our food items, so
choice that it should have straws drawn for it by the gourmet
elite of a very few white folks. Off in the scrub country there
appears from nowhere a clear, bubbling, underground spring. The
spring pours forth such a flood of water as to make a stream, or
run, that flows into the St. John's River. In this spring and
down this run are found enormous blue crabs. They are of the
ocean variety, but I have never known any salt water crabs to
equal them in size or flavor.</p>

<p>Robert and Cecil and Norton and I go crabbing of a dark night.
We drift down the run in a small boat after night has fallen. The
experts wear focussing flashlights on their foreheads, or have a
passenger focus an ordinary flashlight over the side of the boat.
The light shines through the dark water and picks out the great
crabs, feeding on the bottom. The expert lowers cautiously a pair
of crab-claws--open-springed iron jaws at the end of a
twelve-foot pole--and strikes the crab dexterously. The iron jaws
snap shut and the live crab is hauled aboard and dropped in the
fish-box in the boat. As with all hunting, the surroundings are a
great part of the delight. The moving flashlight picks out a
moss-hung cypress there, a swamp maple here, and hoot-owls as big
as eagles sit on low boughs, blinded by the light, and shift
their feet and stare big-eyed at us. Fireflies flicker along the
banks and mullet leap in the darkness. We prefer to crab-hunt on
a night when the moon rises late. We work in darkness down to the
mouth of the run, where the water hyacinths mass against the
current, then paddle upstream with our catch in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>We boil the crabs immediately, twenty minutes in salted water.
We like best to eat them just-so, with homemade mayonnaise and
Cuban bread and cold bitter ale. The meat comes from the shells
in enormous flakes, snow-white and incredibly sweet and
flavorsome. There are two schools of crab-eaters. Some like to
eat as fast as they pick. I find this an infuriating process, for
one works for an hour or more, getting a small mouthful at a
time, and is never satisfied. I take the long view and patiently
pick out the meat from my share of the crabs until I have built
up a fine mound to be eaten in luxury. There is considerable risk
in this procedure, for the still famished piecemeal pickers eye
my luscious pile greedily and have been known to saunter past my
place at table and one by one snatch a forkful from my plate in
selfish jealousy, all because of their own improvidence.</p>

<p>When we have crab meat to spare, I make a crab Newburg so
superlative that I myself taste it in wonder, thinking, "Can it
be I who has brought this noble thing into the world?"</p>

<p>It is impossible to give proportions, for I never twice have
the same amount of crab meat to work with, and here indeed I have
no mother, but only instinct, to guide me. In an iron skillet
over a low fire I place a certain amount of Dora's butter. As it
melts, I stir in the flaked crab meat, lightly, tenderly. The
flakes must not become disintegrated; they must not brown. I add
lemon juice, possibly a tablespoonful for each cup of crab meat.
I add salt and pepper frugally, paprika more generously, and a
dash of powdered clove so temporal that the flavor in the
finished Newburg is only as though the mixture had been whisked
through a spice grove. I add Dora's golden cream. I do not know
the exact quantity. It must be generous, but the delicate crab
meat must never become deluged with any other element. The
mixture bubbles for a few moments. I stir in dry sherry, the
quantity again unestimable. Something must be left to genius. I
stir in well beaten eggs, perhaps an egg, perhaps two, for every
cup of flakes. The mixture must now no more than be turned over
on itself and removed in a great sweep from the fire. I stir in a
tablespoonful, or two, of the finest brandy, and turn the Newburg
into a piping hot covered serving dish. I serve it on toast
points and garnish superfluously with parsley, and a Chablis or
white Rhine wine is recommended as an accompaniment. Angels sing
softly in the distance.</p>

<p>We do not desecrate the dish by serving any other, neither
salad nor dessert. We just eat crab Newburg. My friends rise from
the table, wring my hand with deep feeling, and slip quietly and
reverently away. I sit alone and weep for the misery of a world
that does not have blue crabs and a Jersey cow.</p>

<p>I speak with some trepidation of my blackbird pie, for it
might have brought down on me Federal dishonor, or roughly
speaking, jail. I began the shooting of the blackbirds and the
making of the pies in a spirit of innocent experimentalism. I sat
in a blind on Orange Lake on my first duck hunt. Around and
beyond me the good shots were bringing down their ducks. I had
not touched a feather. Nearby, hundreds of red-winged blackbirds
were stirring in the tussocks. I thought of the four and twenty
blackbirds baked in a pie and wondered if these grain and seed
eating birds might not be the edible ones of the rhymed fable. I
slipped No. 10 shells into my shotgun, and two shots brought down
a dozen birds. I made the dozen very secretly into a pie. It was
utterly delicious. For the next few years, when game was scarce,
or I had not been to market for meats, I relied on blackbirds to
make a tasty dish. I dressed the birds whole, but skinned, dipped
them in flour and browned them in butter, along with tiny whole
onions and tiny whole carrots. I covered them with hot water,
seasoned them with salt, pepper, a bay leaf or two, sometimes a
little of the Greek herb originon, and simmered until tender. I
added small whole new potatoes, chopped parsley and sherry,
placed them in a baking dish and covered them with a thick rich
pastry crust, and finished the dish in the oven. The blackbirds
were exquisite morsels of sweet and tender dark meat. Then I
began to be ashamed of shooting the cheerful chirruping things
that were so ornamental in the marshes. I decided I would do no
more of it. And then I discovered that they were listed on my
hunting license, by a name I had not recognized, among the birds
protected by Federal game laws and forbidden to the hunter. I
wondered what I should have done if the game warden had walked in
on one of my blackbird pies. I decided that there would have been
nothing to do but follow in Fred Tompkins' ways. He and his wife,
the Old Hen, and I were dining at his house one day. She went to
the door and returned nervously.</p>

<p>"Honey," she said to him, "there's a carful of law at the
gate."</p>

<p>"Why, if it's the law," he said, "invite 'em in and give 'em a
snort."</p>

<p>It was in the Big Scrub that I had roasted limpkin. The
Ocklawaha River is one of the two or three remaining haunts of
the strange brown crane who cries before a rain. I lived above
the river with my friend Leonard and his mother Piety, and often
slipped down the high bluff to the swamp along the river, to see
what I might see. I walked there one summer day and beyond me saw
a slow, long-legged bird with a mottled breast and long bill,
feeding on crayfish. It could only be a limpkin, the old timers
had spoken of its flavor, and Piety's kitchen would welcome it. I
crept closer in the swamp, among the cypress knees, and shot with
my .22 rifle. The bird dropped in the water, and only then I
realized that it was out of reach. I believe in killing game only
for one's needs and it distresses me to leave dead or wounded
game unfound. I waded toward the floating limpkin, above my
ankles, above my knees, at last waist-deep. A moccasin swam in
spirals in front of me. I found myself at the edge of a deep
slough. I reached forward with the rifle and drew the limpkin in
to me. Leonard and his mother rejoiced, and we parboiled the bird
and stuffed it and roasted it in the wood range, and I have never
eaten a more delectable fowl. I shot another while I was there,
and then I heard of their vanishing history, and would not shoot
another.</p>

<p>Mistress Piety would have cooked anything I suggested. Leonard
caught a raccoon in a trap, and though I had heard that "'coon
has a foolish kind of taste," I knew that it was eaten and set to
work. I parboiled it, as I had done the limpkin, then roasted it,
and it was so inedible that one by one the three of us were
obliged to head for the open door. I found later that the raccoon
has a musk-sack that must be removed before cooking.</p>

<p>Leonard said, "We hadn't never been hard put to it enough to
try to put down one of them jessies, but we wouldn't leave you to
try it alone."</p>

<p>I am of a divided mind about 'possums. Zelma's mother had one
waiting for our supper when we came in one night from the census
taking. It was roasted with sage stuffing, with sweet potatoes
roasted around it, and it was more delicious than any roast pork.
Then I baked one myself at the Creek, and it was completely
inedible. I found, again too late, that 'possums are scavengers
and must be penned and fed clean food for a week or two before
they are fit to eat. It explained why Martha rejoiced whenever I
captured a 'possum alive on the road at night, but silently
buried it when my car had hit and killed it.</p>

<p>Bear meat is good according to the condition of the bear and
the manner in which it is cooked. A male in the mating season is
almost inedible, like a boar hog. If mast has been scarce and the
late fall and winter have offered poor forage, bear meat is lean
and inclined to stringiness in the early spring. But under proper
conditions, a Florida bear may be fat and sweet at the end of
winter. The Florida bear goes very late into hibernation, emerges
early and the hibernation is never absolute. If acorn mast and
palmetto berries have been plentiful and he has fed late, piling
on layer after layer of fat; if the winter is warm and feed still
abundant, he comes out often, lazily, feeds close to his den,
sleeps again, rouses to stuff in a few mouthfuls of feed, and
goes back to sleep. Under these already favorable conditions of
established avoirdupois, sleep, continued feeding and no ranging,
early spring may turn him out in plump condition.</p>

<p>The finest bear meat I have eaten was at a church meeting at
Eureka. One of the village inhabitants had shot a bear along the
Ocklawaha River a few days before and an enormous roast had been
hung in the smokehouse just long enough to be tendered and aged
in time for the church dinner. It had been cooked as a pot roast,
browned in its own fat, simmered half a day in an iron pot on a
wood range. It was served in cold slices and was the first dish
on the long loaded plank tables to melt away. The flavor was that
of the choicest prime beef, with an added rich gaminess. I gave
thought to a second slice, but so many little Eurekans were
holding up their plates for it that I retired.</p>

<p>I heard a mother say to a small overalled boy, "Now son, you
savor this good. This here's bear meat, and what with things
changin' outen the old ways, and the bears goin', you're like not
to never get to taste it again."</p>

<p>Leonard's mother cooked it equally well. She also sometimes
cut very thin slices from the rib steaks, dipped them in flour
and fried them in deep hot bear fat. They were crisp and brown
and tender. The steaks I ate came from a very large fat bear that
Leonard's bride noticed lumbering down the scrub road. She called
him casually to its despatching. The meat, some fried and put
down in its own fat, some smoked lightly, lasted the family for
many weeks. The golden liquid fat filled two lard tubs and
provided a sweet nutty cooking fat for the whole summer. The bear
was the one creature for which Bartram did not have a kind word.
Although he developed "gratitude and mercy" toward the
rattlesnake, and regretted the killing of a young wolf, he
protested in 1773 that there were "still far too many bears in
Florida." He would find them very nearly gone today.</p>

<p>My elderly friend Cal Long, a famous hunter, told me that
wild-cat liver was a tasty dish, especially in lieu of anything
better by the campfire.</p>

<p>But Leonard said, "I don't want anything to eat my old hound
won't eat. I tried him on a piece of wild-cat liver once, and he
spit it out and just looked at me."</p>

<p>But Cal had old-fashioned tastes in general, and had even
given up hope of curing his rheumatism, since panther oil was no
longer available. All his way of life in the last of his nearly
eighty years irked him. This was especially because a Federal
game refuge had been established in the scrub, taking in his
clearing. He was no longer allowed--he was no longer ostensibly
allowed--to kill deer on his own land. But I noticed that venison
continued a staple meat on his table.</p>

<p>"The law says I cain't shoot a buck in my own potato patch!"
he raged. "The law says I cain't kill me a wild turkey scratchin'
up my cowpeas. The law this, the law that! Why," he snorted, "I'm
too old a man to begin obeyin' the law!"</p>

<p>I have a glass jar of venison in my icebox, of Cal Long's
killing. After it is gone, I think I shall eat no more of it, for
I have lost stomach for the meat of animals that I once studied,
to use for an emotional purpose in a book. I have never killed a
deer, holding my shot several times in wonder at their beauty and
fluid grace of movement. Long ago Leonard and I hunted deer
together in the swamp below his clearing on the Ocklawaha. He put
me on a stand on a narrow island, to which the deer came,
sometimes to feed, sometimes to rest before crossing the river
when pursued.</p>

<p>I stood shielded behind a clump of ash trees, where I might
watch and cover the crossing. Leonard's Indian-soft steps faded
and I strained my hearing for other steps. There was no sound for
a long time but the wind in the cypresses and the rushing of
river current on both sides of the island. In the distance I
heard a light pounding, then running steps so rapid that the two
creatures were breaking cover in front of me before I understood
that they were deer. They hesitated on the bank for an instant
that was only a break in a musical rhythm, a change of beat, then
plunged smoothly into the swift arm of river between mainland and
island. They passed so close to me that I might have tossed the
pointed ash leaves on the beautiful tawny bodies. I do not know
whether they saw or scented me. The great liquid brown eyes
turned anxiously, for the fear of man, the great killer of all
killer animals, is always on them in the hunting season. They
emerged from the water, bounded up the bank of the island, lifted
their white scuts and were gone like ghosts of deer into the
cypresses. As they went, I remembered Piety's waiting cook-pot
and the empty smokehouse. I lifted my gun and fired
half-heartedly far behind the deer, afraid on the instant that by
an accident I might not have missed them. In a few minutes
Leonard crashed through the bushes and jumped to the island.</p>

<p>"I missed," I said, and did not tell my story.</p>

<p>He bent down to examine the tracks.</p>

<p>"Just as good you did, I reckon," he said. "They was an old
doe and a maiden doe."</p>

<p>He led the way back soberly.</p>

<p>"We'll cut us a swamp cabbage up the trail a ways," he said,
"so's not to go home to Ma empty-handed."</p>

<p>Many a hardened hunter has told me that he is done with his
deer killing. When a clean kill is made, he takes pleasure in the
sport, but when the fallen deer is yet alive when he comes up to
it, and he must cut its throat, he cannot face the big eyes
turned on him with a stricken wonder. Such use as Leonard and
Piety make of game is an ancient and honorable and necessary
thing. The meat is needed and none of it is wasted. It is eaten
gratefully. The sportsman often comes to feel that he might
better buy a roast of beef at the butcher's. Venison is seldom as
good as beef.</p>

<p>I am still torn on the matter of bird-shooting. I dread the
day when conscience shall triumph over palate. There is no more
delicious food than quail or dove, the one meat white, the other
dark. I dress them whole, and they must be picked, never skinned.
I stuff them with buttered crumbs and pecans, dip them in flour
and brown them in butter. I place them then in a casserole, pour
over them the browned butter to which a little hot water has been
added, add an eighth of a cup of sherry for every bird, cover and
bake slowly until meltingly tender. I prefer as accompaniments a
Chablis or even a Sauterne for quail, and Burgundy for doves. I
like to serve with them soft-cooked grits, small crisp biscuits,
wild grape or wild plum jelly, whole baby beets warmed in orange
juice and butter with grated orange peel, carrot souffl&eacute;,
a tomato aspic salad, and tangerine sherbet for a dessert. I make
the tangerine sherbet by any good orange sherbet recipe,
substituting tangerine juice for orange juice, and using more
lemon juice and less sugar syrup. I cannot recommend the dessert,
delicate as it is, unless one has one's own tangerine trees. It
takes two large water buckets of tangerines to make sherbet for
eight.</p>

<p>In the matter of cooking ducks, I am in violent opposition to
the pretendedly Epicurean school of raw bloody duck whisked
through a duck press. The advice to "run your duck through a very
hot oven" leaves me shuddering. I prefer my thoroughly done,
moist, crumbling duck to any dripping, rubbery slices, fit only
for the jaws of a dinosaur. When my flock of Mallards has an
unusually successful season, so that I am fairly over-run with
ducks, and the feed-bill equals that of four mules, I am
sometimes obliged to decimate their numbers. My friends hint the
year around that I have too many ducks. When I give in to them
and announce a duck dinner, I find myself unable to eat, and must
have a poached egg on the side. But on these sad occasions, I am
certain of the age of the ducks, and I roast the young ones
quickly. When I am uncertain, as one must be, with wild killed
ducks, I take no chances, and steam them until tender, then
proceed with the roasting, basting often with butter if the wild
ducks have little or no fat. The rest of the menu is: claret;
fried finger-strips of grits; sweet potato orange baskets; small
whole white onions, braised; hot sherried grapefruit; tiny hot
cornmeal muffins; a tossed salad of endive dressed with finely
chopped chives, marjoram, basil, thyme and French dressing made
with tarragon vinegar; for dessert, grape-juice ice cream.</p>

<p>To make the sweet potato orange baskets, I mash peeled boiled
sweet potatoes, add beaten eggs, butter, cream, salt, a few
spoonfuls of orange blossom honey and a little grated orange
peel. I cut oranges in half, scoop out the contents, serrate the
edges so that the half-shells look as though a large and accurate
fox had bitten them; fill the shells with the potato mixture, dot
with butter, and place in a hot oven to brown. A handle of orange
peel may be added, but this is only elegance and gets in the way.
The hot sherried grapefruit that I serve with the duck makes also
an excellent first course on a cold night, or a dessert when
something light is needed. I prepare grapefruit halves as for
breakfast serving, turning them upside down to drain off the
excess juice. I sprinkle the fleshy part with brown sugar,
powdered clove and dots of butter, and fill the centers with
sherry. I brown them in the oven or under the broiler and serve
them piping hot. The grape-juice ice cream is pleasantly acid
after the rich duck. To a pint of grape-juice I add the juice of
one lemon, half a cup to a cup of sugar, and a pint or so of
heavy cream, and freeze. This meal sounds simple and
well-balanced, but somehow it is deadly. I have very nearly
killed people with it. I keep hoping that it will teach them not
to hint for my ducks.</p>

<p>The pilau is almost a sacred Florida dish, and for making a
small amount of meat feed a large number, it has no equal. A
Florida church supper is unheard of without it. Bartram found the
dish here those many years ago, and called it "pillo," and once,
"pilloe." We pronounce the word purr-loo. Almost any meat, but
preferably chicken or fresh pork, is cut in pieces and simmered
in a generous amount of water until tender. When it falls from
the bones, as much rice is added as is needed for the number to
be fed, and cooked to a moist flakiness. The flavor of meat and
gravy permeates the last grain of rice. Fred Tompkins once cooked
a coot liver and gizzard pilau at the Creek. It was very good,
and the only time I have been able to down coot in any form. The
rest of the Creek considers coots almost as edible as ducks. I
have followed Martha's directions faithfully, soaking the coots
overnight in vinegar-water and parboiling with soda before
roasting, but they still taste rankly of the marsh mud on which
they have fed.</p>

<p>We are all in complete agreement on squirrel meat. Fried,
smother-fried with a rich gravy, or made into a pilau, we esteem
it highly. There are, however, strong differences of opinion on
the edibility of the head. I saw this disagreement flare up
violently at the doings at Anthony.</p>

<p>Word came that Fatty Blake, a snuff and tobacco salesman, and
Anthony's richest citizen--wealth at Anthony, as elsewhere, is
relative--was having a big doings on a certain Thursday night.
The world was invited. Fatty himself stopped at the village store
to verify the invitation. He was inviting two counties to his
doings, and all was free. There would be squirrel pilau and
Brunswick stew. Fatty couldn't likker folks, as he would like to
do, but if you brought your own 'shine and were quiet about it,
why, he'd meet you at the gate for a drink, and God bless
you.</p>

<p>"I got boys in the woods from can't-see to can't-see," he
said, "getting me squirrels for that pilau. I got a nigger coming
to stir that pot of rice all day long. And my wife, God bless
her, is walking the county, getting what she needs for Brunswick
stew, the kind her mammy made ahead of her in Brunswick,
Georgia."</p>

<p>Cars and wagons and lone horses and mules began coming in to
Anthony long before dark. They brought women in homemade silks
and in ginghams, men in mail-order store clothes with stiff
collars and men in the blue pin-checks of the day's work.
Children screamed and played all over the swept sand about
Fatty's two-story house. The wives of Anthony bustled up and down
a forty-foot pine-board table. Each had brought her contribution,
of potato salad made by stirring cut onion and hard-boiled eggs
into cold mashed potatoes, of soda biscuits and pepper relish, of
pound cake and blueberry pie. Back of the house a Negro stirred
rice in a forty-gallon iron kettle with a paddle as big as an
oar. It grew dark and the crowd was hungry.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock Mrs. Jim Butler played three solo hymns on
the Blakes' parlor organ, moved out to the front porch for the
occasion. Then she lifted her shrill soprano voice in the opening
strains of "I know Salvation's free," and the crowd joined in
with quavering pleasure. At seven-thirty the Methodist preacher
rose to his feet beside the organ. He lauded Fatty Blake as a
Christian citizen. He prayed. Here and there a devout old woman
cried "Amen!" And then the parson asked that any one so minded
contribute his mite to help Brother Blake defray the expense of
this great free feast.</p>

<p>"Will Brother Buxton pass the hat?"</p>

<p>The hat was passed, and as the pennies and nickels clinked
into it, Fatty Blake made his address of welcome.</p>

<p>"I've done brought all you folks together," he shouted, "in
the name of brotherly love. I want to tell you, all at one great
free table, to love one another.</p>

<p>"Don't just stick to your own church," he pleaded. "If you're
a Baptist, go to the Methodist church when the Methodists have
preaching Sunday. If you're a Methodist, go help the Baptists
when their preacher comes to town.</p>

<p>"Now I want to tell you this meal is free and I had no idea of
getting my money back, but as long as our good parson here has
mentioned it, I'll say just do what your pocket and your feelings
tell you to, and if you feel you want to do your share in this
big community feed, why, God bless you.</p>

<p>"Now, folks, we've all enjoyed the entertainment, and I know
you're going to enjoy the rations just as much. There's all you
can eat and eat your fill. Don't hold back for nobody. Get your
share of everything. I've had a nigger stirring the pilau since
sun-up and it smells the best of any pilau I've ever smelt. It's
got forty squirrels in it, folks, forty squirrels and a big fat
hen. And my wife herself made that Brunswick stew, just like she
learned it at her mother's knee in Brunswick, Georgia. Now go to
it, folks, but don't rush!"</p>

<p>The crowd packed tight around the table, weaving and milling.
The pilau and stew were passed around in paper dishes. The
passing hat reached a lean, venerable farmer just as he had
completed a tour of exploration through his pilau.</p>

<p>"No!" he shrilled, with the lustiness of an old man with a
grievance.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't goin' to give him nothin'! This here was
advertised as a free meal and 'tain't nothin' but a dogged
Georgia prayer-meetin'. Get a man here on promises and then go to
pickin' his pocket. This food ain't fitten to eat, dogged Georgia
rations, Brunswick stew and all. And he's done cooked the
squirrel heads in the pilau, and that suits a damned Georgia
Cracker but it don't suit me.</p>

want no squirrel eyes lookin' at me out o' my rations!"</p>

<h2><a name="c18">18. <i>Spring at the Creek</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Here in Florida the seasons move in and out like nuns in soft
clothing, making no rustle in their passing. It is common for me
at least to fall on a certain kind of sunny day into a sort of
amnesia. I think with a start, "What is the time of year? Where
was I yesterday? And is this May or October?"</p>

<p>Because time frightens me, and I seek, like a lonely child,
the maternal solace of timelessness, I plant only the evergreen
shrubs and have no more than can be helped of the deciduous trees
around me. All year the orange grove is luminous. The oleanders
glisten. The palm trees shed the cold as blandly as the rain.
Unless severe frost has struck them, the Turk's-cap and hibiscus
bear red lanterns day in, day out, to light the timid before the
dark face of time. Only the pecan trees scattered through the
grove shed their leaves in November and stand stripped and
shivering until April. Strangers ask in winter, "What are the
dead trees in the orange grove?" I bear with the sight of them
for the sake of the harvest. When in spring the first feathery
leaves appear and the gaunt grayness is misted with green, I draw
a secret breath of relief, as though a danger were now over.</p>

<p>Yesterday when I stood under the large pecan tree by the barn
gate, the amnesia came over me. I had not expected a crop this
year, for the trees bore heavily last season, and are almost
completely biennial in their bearing. But as I reached absently
to pull down a bough, I saw that slender green nuts were forming
at the growth-ends of all the branches. The sight was unexpected,
and I was suddenly lost in a wave of timelessness. I thought for
an instant that I was back in the May of a year ago. Then it
seemed to me that I had skipped this present season and had been
precipitated into the coming year. The pecan tree was bearing
again, and where was I in time and space? And the old comfort
came, in the recurrence, and on the heels of the comfort,
despair, that there was no end to seasons, but an end to me.</p>

<p>A knowledge brushed me as briefly as though a bird had flown
past me from the tree. Lives are only one with living. How dare
we, in our egos, claim catastrophe in the rise and fall of the
individual entity? There is only Life, and we are beads strung on
its strong and endless thread.</p>

<p>The bird was gone. I remembered that the rationalists call
this consciousness mysticism. I did not think that by any name it
was shameful. The season was May of this year. I withdrew into
the turtle shell of my mortality. It was good to know there would
be pecans, unexpectedly, this November. I turned away and left
them to their maturing.</p>

<p>There is a beauty of the strange and a beauty of the familiar.
The traveller to far places is enchanted because what he sees is
new. If he found himself obliged to live forever in some quaint
hamlet, the picturesqueness that intrigued him with its novelty
would be likely to become his prison. The test of beauty is
whether it can survive close knowledge. This is as true of
persons as of places. The dancer, dazzling behind the footlights,
may in ordinary living be so dull, so unkind, so fractious, that
her smooth limbs and lovely face are lost in the immediacy of her
spiritual unloveliness. On the other hand, a very plain woman or
an ugly man may receive a deep devotion, because the known
qualities of mind and spirit are beautiful, and this familiar
beauty lies like a soft veil over any physical inadequacies.</p>

<p>I wonder what spring would mean to one who was encountering
it, if such a thing were conceivable, for the first time. My
notion is that it would mean nothing. Spring is beautiful because
it is familiar. Its implications are stirring because we
understand them. We know the cold that precedes it and the hot
sun that will follow it. It is generally believed that the
northern spring is more portentous than the tropical or
sub-tropical spring, because the contrast between cold and
warmth, between frozen sterility and hot fertility is more
apparent. This is not true when, as in the sub-tropics at Cross
Creek, spring is so well known that its coming is as important as
a smile across a beloved face. A very clever poet, Wallace
Stevens, ended a poem with saying, "But there is no spring in
Florida." He did not know Florida. He came as a stranger, a
traveller, to Florida, and the lushness of spring was to him only
lushness. He could not differentiate among the shades of green,
which at Cross Creek tell us when to plant and when to fertilize
and when to cultivate. He did not know when the red-bird begins
to sing again, and when the cypress bursts from gray bareness
into a dress of soft needles and the swamp maple puts out young
passionate red leaves.</p>

<p>At the Creek, spring is as definite and as exciting as in
Greenland. We have not had snow behind us, but we have had an
ungrowing period, as have they, and life now stirs and sap rises
and the creatures mate and the snakes come out of their winter's
lethargy. Because it is familiar and beloved, we watch every
gradation. It is dear to us because knowledge of it is necessary
to recognize its variations. There is no one sign of spring, but
several spontaneous burstings. At the moment of the cypresses'
needled sprouting and the swamp maples' glory of color, there
bloom the yellow jessamine and the red-bud. If anything comes
first, it is the jessamine. Along the fence rows, through the
hammocks, slim dry vines are suddenly a mass of golden bloom, so
fragrant that the initiate all but swoons. Like many tropical
flowers, the jessamine is most potent in the night time. I have
been on Orange Lake by night and had the scent of the jessamine
come so strongly from the far shores that it seemed an immense
perfume flask had been spilled from the stars. There is a cousin
of the yellow jessamine, the night-blooming jasmine, whose odor
is so sweet and strong that invalids cannot endure it in their
rooms or outside their windows.</p>

<p>Martha says, "It really tears loose after nightfall."</p>

<p>The jessamine is at its height, spilling waterfalls of gold
from high in the tallest trees, when the major miracle occurs.
One evening there is the jessamine in the sunset, alone in a
world of arrested color. The next morning there is a tinge of
green across the gray Spanish moss, and infinitesimal rosy
blossoms may be discovered along its strands, the distant hammock
is emerald, and on the soft air floats a fragrance for which we
have hungered the whole year through. The first orange blossoms
have opened. For a month or six weeks we shall be giddy by day
with them and at night drown in a sea of perfume. When the orange
blossoms are almost done, the grapefruit blooms and then the
tangerines, and these have a sharp spiciness of odor, so that
after having lived with them for a few years, one knows
blindfolded which citrus fruit is flowering and what month it is.
For the seasons at the Creek are marked, not by the calendar, but
by fruits and flowers and birds.</p>

<p>When the oranges bloom, it is time for the spring fertilizing
and the first spring cultivating. After a warm winter, the
jessamine blooms in late January and the orange trees in early
February. After an average winter, the jessamine blooms in early
February and the oranges in the middle of the month. After a long
winter with protracted cold, as this year, the jessamine waits
wisely until the frost is over. While the orange trees are more
injudicious and come into bud at what should be the proper time,
regardless of temperature, they too understand that they have
thrust their small white noses into an unfriendly world, and hold
up the full blossoming until the atmosphere is propitious.</p>

<p>The wild iris is as stubborn as the orange bloom is impatient.
Norton and I make useless trips every spring to the River Styx,
to find the buds ready but tight-shut week after week. The iris
knows what it wants in the way of April weather and waits for
precisely the acceptable conjunction of rain and warmth. Then
acre on acre bursts open on the same sunny morning, and the swamp
bordering the Styx is blue from the edge of the narrow sand road
to the farthest rim of cypresses. We must wade knee-deep to
gather the flowers, going cautiously through the leaf-brown water
for fear of roots or sharp cypress knees or moccasins. The egrets
are nesting when the iris blooms and fly up from their feeding
like bursts of white spray as our splashing disturbs them. They
light close by their nests in the cypresses and wait, preening
the lacy tail feathers of the mating and nesting season, for us
to finish our swamp business. The wild iris does not have the
fragrance of the fleur-de-lis of cultivated gardens, but its
color is a more exquisite and a lighter blue. And where the
gardener's iris may be only politely looked at, the wild iris
grows in such a wanton profusion that our armfuls, taken home to
the house, leave no break in the blue sheet beside the Styx.</p>

<p>We say at the Creek, "When the first whippoorwill calls it's
time for the corn to be in the ground."</p>

<p>The first whippoorwill may call in late February or in March.
I cannot guarantee his accuracy as a weather prophet, but I have
never known frost to come after that first plaintive,
heart-tearing cry. If the corn is not already planted, we hurry
to get it in. Our Florida whippoorwill is not the same bird that
stirred me as a child on my father's Maryland farm. The bird here
is the chuck-will's-widow and the call is not so melodious as
that of the more northern bird. It is as though the northern call
were harshened and syncopated, like the modern swing versions of
Mozart and Bach. Martha told me that the bird is crying, "Chip
hell out of the red oak! Chip hell out of the red oak!" The
phonetics are accurate. Martha spoiled the romance of the
whippoorwill's call for me, for now I cannot hear it without
repeating her belligerent and unbeautiful words.</p>

<p>But there was a spring night, before I knew that the
whippoorwill was actually the chuck-will's widow and that it was
insisting, "Chip hell out of the red oak!" when the spell of the
cry brought me from my bed. There was a full moon and the scent
of orange blossoms was heavy across the night, and a whippoorwill
was calling, only a little distance away. I went out into the
grove and my dog went with me, and we played and danced in the
moonlight under the flowering orange trees. Old Jib came wobbling
to join us and the dog and cat and I romped together until nearly
dawn. The whippoorwill came closer and closer until he was
sitting within sight of us on the fence, as though he were
pleased to have dancers for his music. It is as well that no late
frog-hunter passed by while we were at our frolic, or it would
surely have been told as proved fact that those who live at the
Creek are fey.</p>

<p>The robins, who bring spring to the north, have for us here no
connection with the season. They come to my grove in vast flocks
to feed and wait for the mysterious signal that sends them on.
But they are tourists, interested in passing matters, and they
stop with us only long enough to rest and feed and go on again.
Before they reach their nesting places in the north they have
made half a dozen such stops of varying duration and it is
impossible to estimate their arrival in New York, for instance,
by the date of their dallying at the Creek. I do not know what
feed it is they find, but they go to the same grounds used by the
turtle doves and I suppose the same seed-pods appeal to both. The
robins darken the pecan trees across the road, they cover my
yard, not singing the song that I used to know, but emitting
meaningless chirps. Their breasts at this time are not ruddy.
They are restless, and feed with their usual bobbing run, then
for no reason all fly at once. On windy mornings I hear, not a
casual flying, but a storm of wings. They are here in such
numbers that I am sometimes tempted to try them out in a robin
pot-pie, but I recall my own days in the north and cannot
annihilate any symbol of spring for folk in a more unfortunate
clime.</p>

<p>Our bird-hunting season ends toward the end of February, when
mating begins, and the quail and doves have their mystic calendar
marked with the date as plainly as our own. During the hunting
season they are wise and wary. Within a few days after the guns
have stopped firing, the quail feed in plain sight along the
roadways and the doves, the wildest of all birds, I think, except
the wild turkey, fly into my yard. This spring one dove came
ahead of time and flew inside my gate before the season ended.
The laws of hospitality and refuge forbade my disturbing him and
he took the overflow from the red-birds' feed basket unmolested.
I am hypocrite enough in any case not to shoot at birds who live
on my place. A covey of quail lives the year around in my grove
and I think of them as co-inhabitants. The human ego is a fearful
thing and we consider those things, friends, relatives, stock,
that touch our lives, to be somehow different because they are
close to us.</p>

<p>The mating season is not at the Creek quite as markedly a
thing of spring as farther north. My wild Mallard ducks breed all
winter and calves and pigs may be born at any time. Yet there is
a resurgence of the life sap, no matter how subtle, for the
creatures and birds as well as for the trees. The red-birds sing
all through the winter and I have awakened to delirious duets on
a morning when icicles hung from the water-tower and the oranges
were frozen solid. The red-birds' song has to do with their
mating, for it is the males who proclaim in season the delights
of love and the glory of the world. Yet the first of the year's
two hatchings of young arrives in our spring.</p>

<p>In late February or early March I hear pitiful cries about the
feed basket in the crepe myrtle, and the two pairs of red-birds
who have shared my life at the Creek as long as I have been here,
are introducing their young to cracked corn and grains of wheat.
The young are almost as large as the parents at this time, and
while they can fly quite well and are entirely capable of picking
up the feed for themselves, they flutter with a false
helplessness, sit in the very middle of the feed basket, and
allow the devoted father and mother to pick up the grains and
drop them in their perfectly able maws. I once saw a mocking-bird
mother go into a rage at her offspring's insistence on a
prolonged adolescence. Food was at the young bird's feet, but he
cried lamentably and ruffled his feathers and opened his mouth
for the manna to be dropped into it. The mother patiently picked
up the feed and dropped it and picked it up again, to show her
child the manner in which it was done. He opened his bill the
wider. Suddenly she flew at him in a fury, pecked him several
times, and flew away. He must shift for himself. He looked over
his shoulder disconsolately, then went to work and fed himself
with complete efficiency.</p>

<p>My Mallards theoretically should show signs of restlessness in
the spring, even though they are not penned. All their kind are
flying north. Night and day the V-formations pass over the grove.
But my ducks are as enthusiastic about our mutual life as I, have
no intention of changing its security for the unknown, and the
wild instinct seems in them completely stultified. It is
altogether too easy to attribute human characteristics to
animals. It is perhaps logical, if unfortunate, for man to create
God in his own image, but it is taking advantage of the
creatures' dumbness to assign our complicated emotions to their
simpler natures. Nature writers who turn foxes into little men
and women are somehow embarrassing. Yet in the face of my own
prejudice, I am obliged to insist that my domesticated wild
Mallards possess to the highest degree of any creatures I know,
animal or human, an acutely conscious <i>joie de vivre.</i> A dog
knows when he is having a good time. But his fun derives from a
definite objective, a walk, a ride, a hunt, a swim. The Mallards
awaken with the first tinge of light, shake their wings, and give
voice to their delight as plainly as though they shouted, "Hah!
Another day of good living!"</p>

<p>It was when I began to understand their capacity for enjoyment
that I turned my first flock loose from their pen. A gift of a
dozen eggs from a Carolina marsh had been set under a hen. Eight
of the eggs hatched into golden ducklings, self-sufficient from
the first breath. I allowed them to wean themselves from the
puzzled foster mother as soon as they were ready, and put them to
live in a generous enclosure, screened overhead as well as on all
sides.</p>

<p>I was told by every one, "Once they are out of the pen, you
have seen the last of your ducks."</p>

<p>We watched the gate carefully, going in and out to feed them,
to change the water in the syrup kettle I had sunk in the ground
for a swimming pool. We pictured them slipping past us to escape
at the first opportunity. They grew, thrived and lived, a year
and a half, as wild as birds could possibly be. When any of us
entered the pen, they shrieked and huddled at the farthest
corner. They could not be starved into coming to any one to take
feed. They seemed to live in suspended animation--waiting. Yet I
began to be aware of the delight with which they greeted the day,
the conversations they had among themselves, the sudden bursts of
playfulness in which they flew back and forth in the pen. One day
I could not endure it any longer. I opened the pen door and went
away.</p>

<p>"Your freedom," I said over my shoulder, "with my compliments
and apologies."</p>

<p>I expected them to rise in a great sweep and take off for the
adjacent marsh. I hoped only that they would migrate out of reach
of the hunters' guns before the season should open. An hour later
I saw them investigating the barn. When the chickens were fed
that evening, the Mallards joined them. At sundown they walked in
single file into their pen. I heard them talking amiably all
night. In the morning they filed out again. They took possession
of the grove as of a rightful heritage. In the four years since
then they have never once gone out of sight of it. For sport,
they fly back and forth through the grove and sometimes over the
house. Their wings are unclipped, they are strong and able,
Orange Lake is within a few seconds' flight. Yet the grove holds
all they ask. Freedom, it would seem, can lie in the smallest
area. It is necessary only to know that there are no bars. I
rejoice in the day when I set them free, and watch them for hours
at a time, almost, sometimes, in envy of their patent excitement
in living.</p>

<p>Food is a constant adventure. They clamor for the morning
scattering of the scratch feed. Then, stuffed, they waddle about
in search of choice items for dessert; grasshoppers, small
insects and worms, and something they find, or perpetually hope
to find, under grass roots. When one comes on that rare delicacy,
a small green tree frog, there is a commotion and a chase of the
flock after the finder that seems more of a game than a threat,
for finders seem to be keepers, and I have never seen the prey
snatched away. The lucky duck stands and swallows his frog and
the others stand in a circle and admire his cleverness. They cock
their heads, their bright beady eyes shine in the sun. Then the
whole flock suddenly flies across the yard in a burst of
enthusiasm. Their landings always alarm me. I am forever
expecting them to break a leg. Accustomed in a wild state to
landing on water, they soar down on the hard sand with apparently
no attempt to soften the bump. Their expressions show a mild
surprise each time, as though the pitch forward, on landing, were
something on which they had not calculated. In the late morning
and again in mid-afternoon they take a siesta. They cluster in
the shade of an orange tree in the front yard, or under the
tangerine tree in the side yard where the old cat lies already in
the coolest spot, tuck their heads under their wings and drowse.
Then the game is on again, and there is a swim in the syrup
kettle, with a terrific splashing and a standing on heads after
the under-water growth that should be at the bottom of the kettle
if the place were a proper pond. At evening, they shriek again
for scratch feed. They eat quickly but sparingly, merely making
sure that the game chickens have not been given a superior feed
to theirs, then waddle single file into their pen where they eat
again at their leisure. They prefer to be shut up at night. It is
amazing to find so strong a home instinct in wild and migratory
birds. Most of them were born in the pen, and when the sun goes
down, the pen is where they choose to be. If there is a delay in
the farce of driving them in and closing the door, they stand
inside near the entrance and demand the service. Until dark they
make a pleased and pleasant clacking. Now and then in the night
they burst into an uproar and I know that some small animal
trespasser is going by. Sometimes the commotion, I know, comes
when one of the drakes is having a nocturnal amorous moment.</p>

<p>It is the ducks, the females, who have the loud voices. It is
an astonishing contrast to their sprightly gentleness. The
drakes, shameless and brutal and lusty fellows, are doomed to the
faintest of sibilant whispers. There must have been a prehistoric
mix-up in assigning voices to ducks and drakes. In the breeding
season, from late fall through winter and spring, until June or
July, the drakes infuriate me so that I swear I shall eat them
all. Their love life is merciless, public and continuous. The
chickens mate so casually, a mere duty to be done, that the
onlooker thinks nothing of it. The drakes are Rabelaisian, they
are Turks, they are Huns. The ducks go for months with pecked
heads and lamed legs. They must feed surreptitiously by night,
for it does not seem as though the drakes give them time by day.
In odd moments the drakes fight one another. There is always one
outcast drake among them whom they have evidently agreed shall
not have a chance to produce his pariah's progeny. Such a one
comes as close as a drake can to unhappiness, lean for lack of
love, his neck picked clean of feathers. He lives slyly and
shrewdly, appealing, I believe, to the ducks' maternal instinct,
for I sometimes see things made easy for him when the head men
are busy chasing a butterfly.</p>

<p>Yet during the months when Mars and Venus are rampant, the
drakes are so handsome that it is a joy to see them. They are
jet-black and purple, with doeskin-colored wing patches, and
iridescent as opals in the sunlight. I let the fall go by, and
the winter, furious at them and doting on them. Then the new
clutches are safely raised and join the parent flock and one day
in summer it is suddenly almost impossible to tell the drakes
from the hens. They have lost all their fine color, and with it,
their arrogance. They live decently and amiably, are thoroughly
charming and ingratiating, and I am glad that I spared them.</p>

<p>Raising the young each year is a difficult business. The first
season was good. The original eight became forty, and ate more
scratch feed than at the time I could afford. Visualizing the
same rate of increase each year, that winter I let my friends
devour half of them. Then lean times came for ducklings, for I
think word spread through the hammock that there were new
delicacies in the orange grove. Chicken snakes, rats, skunks and
'possums made nightly calls. The older ducks still choose to lay
their eggs and brood their nests inside the family pen, which is
reasonably safe, but the young matrons, who will not, I suppose,
listen to what their elders tell them, have a trick of stealing
their nests under my ornamental shrubbery and along the
fence-rows, where the first prowling varmint or snake cleans them
out.</p>

<p>The birth of a fresh clutch is a grand moment. From under the
dark patient wings of the mother pops a small fluffy yellow head
with a pair of black shoe buttons set in it. If the event takes
place in the pen, the other ducks announce it. The drakes are
displeased and suspicious. The childless ducks make a great
to-do, much upset that they themselves have nothing. We drive the
adults, male and female, from the pen, and shut the door against
them. They file around and around, raucous with interest. The
first duckling slips out and darts around like a wind-blown
shuttlecock. Another follows. Then, terrified, they rush back to
their mother and climb on her back to wait for what is now to
them the tedious business of the rest of the hatching. Sundown
usually sees the last out of the shell, and duck and ducklings
are moved to the safe small pen where they will live until the
young get their tail feathers. At this time they develop as well
the oil sack with which they protect themselves against a rain.
Before, they cannot survive a thorough drenching. Casualties,
too, were high in the big syrup kettle until I found what was
wrong. They could swim, of course, from the moment they broke the
shell. But they swam themselves literally to death, for if the
kettle was not filled to the brim, they could not climb out
again.</p>

<p>Now life is as safe as I can make it until they are ready to
shift for themselves. The last batch has been given its freedom.
I went to the small pen door and threw it open.</p>

<p>"Come out," I said, "and see the world."</p>

<p>Snow stood behind me.</p>

<p>"It ain't much of a world to come out to right now," he said,
"but I reckon a duck's one thing that won't know the
difference."</p>

<p>The blue-jays bring their young to the feed-basket and the
bird-bath for a week or two in the spring. Ordinarily the jays
are almost as sociable as the mocking-birds and like to live near
people and houses. They drive off other birds and many
bird-lovers have difficulty in keeping them away in order to have
the song-birds about. My blue-jays live most of the year in the
hammock. I believe they are kept away by one most belligerent
male red-bird, who has set up an arbitrary order of feeding for
all other birds who come to what he considers his own boarding
house. He stands guard while his lady feeds and if there are
young he feeds them tenderly. He drives off any other birds
fiercely until he and his family are replete and bathed. The
quarrelsome jays retreat before the small ruffled bunch of red
feathers, and I am constantly amazed at the potency of a
bluff.</p>

<p>He is more tolerant of the tiny West Indian ground doves who
nest in the orange trees, perhaps because of their size. He
allows them to bathe with him, but if one takes up the desirable
center of the bath, he drives it to one side. He is recognizable
among the other red-birds, being a trifle larger, quite the
reddest of them all, and with a crest that seems higher, perhaps
only because it is constantly erected, thanks to his choleric
nature. He likes to sing loudly from the pecan tree by the
kitchen, and continues his singing when I walk directly under the
tree. I call up to him to thank him, and he pauses, cocks his
head at me, flicks his tail, and breaks into a fresh tune. He is
a devoted husband and last summer I saw him make patient efforts
to induce his lady to share with him a sunflower. It grew by
accident outside the kitchen window and came early into seed. I
saw him come again and again, peck out one or two seeds, then fly
away. He had gone to tell his mate of the feast he had found. At
last he persuaded her to follow him. She sat in the tangerine
tree a few feet away and was plainly bored and unconvinced. He
perched on the sunflower, pecked and lifted his bill with a
recognizable delight. He chirped to her, and when she turned
indifferently to preening her feathers, he flew to her with a
sunflower seed in his beak and fed it to her lovingly. She
followed him then to the sunflower, took another seed, but still
was not impressed. She flew away and I never saw him make another
attempt to share the flower with her. He came every day and
finished it alone.</p>

<p>The little West Indian ground doves are enchanting. They are
of the softest gray, with ashes of roses breasts, rosy beaks and
tiny pink feet that make a lacy pattern in the sand. They walk
rapidly with a bobbing motion, and fly in small explosive bursts,
like a milkweed pod popping open. They are amorous, as doves
should be, and mate several times a year. I once saw a pair
consummate their union on the tip of a crepe myrtle bough, most
precariously, and other pairs have mated at the edge of the
bird-bath. The male makes a pretence of ferocity, and after
having crooned softly for hours to his mate, suddenly ruffles his
feathers and pursues her with what would pass for viciousness if
she were not so easily and happily caught. I think of them as
giving their throbbing call the year around, but I am sure it is
a concomitant of the mating, and since the breeding is so
frequent, it is only now and then that I realize I have not been
hearing the sweet sad cry from the roof-tree.</p>

<p>One spring in the mating season two pairs were fluttering in
the palm tree by my gate. The long grooved stems of the large
palm fronds leave the trunk at a downward sloping angle. I saw
first one dove and then another bob to the top of a stem and
slide down it, sailing off into the air at the tip of the frond
like ski-jumpers. A few minutes later either the same pair or the
other pair, I could not tell which, slid down the same palm stem
and across the frond. This could easily have been a coincidence
and an accident, yet it had every appearance of a blithe game, as
though the doves were honeymooners at their palm tree Coney
Island.</p>

<p>I have difficulty in distinguishing the cry of the ground dove
from that of the mourning, or turtle dove. It is only when both
varieties are calling that the difference is clear. The cry of
the ground dove is softer and sweeter. That of the larger
mourning dove is fuller and richer and infinitely more sad, a
lament rather than a croon. The cry of the mourning dove comes
also in their mating season in late February and early March, but
to the Negroes it is the cry of death and they shudder when they
hear it. Martha told me that the mourning dove is the Biblical
dove, the turtle dove whose cry is heard in the land, and the
dove liberated by Noah in search of signs of land. Noah, Martha
says, promised the dove to pay him if he would bring a tangible
portent. The dove believed him, flew far and wide, found land
emerging from the flood waters, plucked an olive branch with
great difficulty and flew back with it, exhausted, to Noah. The
patriarch refused to pay him.</p>

<p>And since then, Martha says, the words the sad dove cries are,
"No-ah, <i>pay</i> me! <i>Pay</i> me!"</p>

<p>I am familiar only with the lives of the birds who live close
around me at the Creek and come to the grove. There has been so
much to do, so many creatures to watch and study, that I do not
know the ways of the Louisiana heron, the great white heron, the
small white heron, or egret, the cranes and all the other birds
who fly over and are gone to their secret haunts. I see them
pass, I hear the calls of those that are articulate, such as the
great bittern and the curlew, but I know from books only a few
details of their living. When my own life shall not be so
crowded, when Cross Creek itself quiets down, if that is
possible, and things stop happening, I mean to learn more of
these other neighbors. I know that the eagles nest in spring, for
a vast ragged nest stood until a few years ago high in a cypress
across the Creek, and I saw the pair at the nest, and then
awkward young sitting on adjacent limbs, and have had the female
sweep low over me as I stood, damning with harsh scoldings my
busybody staring. The tree blew down in a great storm and the
pair moved several miles away, between the Creek and the village.
My friend Moe said that the ruined nest had stood across the
Creek for forty years, to his knowledge. These are the
bald-headed eagles, the true American eagle.</p>

<p>The egrets are coming back into their proper numbers, thanks
to Federal protection and to women's vanity taking another turn
than the wearing of their feathers. They nest and feed around
little lily-filled ponds all along the Creek road. The great
American heron is here in smaller numbers. This is a solitary
bird and he lives usually alone except in the mating season. One
year we had only one of the birds with us. He seemed to begin to
feel his loneliness and took to wandering from across the Creek
and coming to our gates. He made the rounds of each house and
bent his beautiful white head on its long neck to pick up the
crumbs we put out for him. He was so tame that one day he flew
into my yard and walked nobly and unafraid under the orange
trees. We all tried to approach him, but the only human he would
allow to come quite close was Sissie's little black boy. The
great white heron would take food from the black child's hand,
and the two stood looking at each other in a strange primitive
communion.</p>

<p>I wrote Doctor Gilbert Pearson of the Audubon Society that I
had heard a pair of whooping cranes on the Lochloosa side of my
grove. He wrote me that unfortunately that was impossible, as the
whooping crane was almost extinct and certainly would not now be
found in my section. The birds I had heard, whose harsh cries had
sounded like a rusty pump, were great American bitterns. But
later I did see a pair of whooping cranes in the Everglades, and
my hunting companion the Major, a trustworthy ornithologist, is
certain that he saw a pair fly over Orange Lake. The whooping
crane was once shot for food and very nearly annihilated, but he
too is coming back again. I wrote of their mysterious dance in a
book, and while the account came from hearsay, it was reliable,
the witnesses being two old men who had known the birds in their
youth.</p>

<p>An exotic visitor came several years in June to my grove, and
I was mad with excitement. I believed it to be an ivory-billed
woodpecker, considered probably extinct, or very nearly so. The
woodpecker was enormous. Swooping from trunk to trunk of the
orange trees, he appeared the size of a half-grown turkey. He was
brilliant in black and red and white, and gave a loud
clapper-like cry. I discovered that he was almost certain to be,
not the ivory-billed, but the large pileated woodpecker. There is
one distinguishing mark between the two, and for two Junes I have
had my Audubon bird book ready to open to the two portraits, to
identify definitely my visitor, but he has never come again. At
the Creek the pileated woodpecker is known as the Lord-God.</p>

<p>Of the small animals that frequent the Creek, the skunks,
'coons, 'possums and an occasional wild-cat, I also know too
little. I shall know them better some day. But the habits of the
domestic animals are there for all to see, and spring brings us
an ever-fresh crop of such things as biddies and calves. I keep
game chickens and the hens are half-wild and steal their nests.
They come in from their hidden settings in the grove or fly down
from the hayloft, proud and maternal, trailed by enormous
hatchings of fluffy yellow and black balls.</p>

<p>I keep cows through no love of having them about, but for
frank culinary purposes. A country kitchen has no excuse for
existence without pans of yellow milk, inch deep in cream, pounds
of fresh-churned butter and foaming buttermilk. But calves are
charming and their birth is a part of the spring quickening of
life. I remember the early April when Dora had her first baby. I
had no man on the place, but my friend Ivey had come out from the
village to give me a hand with some odd jobs. I had known Ivey as
a great dancer and the best caller for square dances in three
counties. He is tall and lean and kicks up his heels in the
figures like a young colt. He makes excuses to do work for me,
for he is enamored of the Creek and hopes some day to have his
own farm here. Meantime, the next best thing is pruning in my
grove, or setting out bougainvillea vines and hibiscus bushes. He
begs cuttings from his mother to plant at my place. He came to me
with big eyes from his work in a misty rain.</p>

<p>"Dora's just had her calf in the hammock," he said. "It's
going to rain hard in a little bit. Don't you think we ought to
get them in the barn?"</p>

<p>We went to the hammock among the blackberry vines in bloom and
found the new-born calf beside the mother. Dora lowed to us in
greeting. She licked the calf's small face, to call our attention
to its charm. The birth-nest was nearby and she had tried to draw
the wobbly calf for shelter from the rain under a patch of
sparkleberry bushes. She seemed to understand when Ivey picked up
the calf in his arms and she followed us lowing but without
anxiety. Ivey's young face was luminous. He carried the calf
tenderly and spoke reassuringly to the mother. At the barn he
pitched down fresh hay and made a good thick bed for both of
them. He fed and watered Dora and stroked the calf. His voice
trembled.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful experience," he whispered, "for all of
us."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the spring birthings also mean pigs. Hordes of
them are born to torment me. In a no-fence county, stock is free
to roam as it wills, and the landowner must fence against them if
he does not wish to be over-run. My fences are good, but smart
pigs are better, and I have always an assortment of Creek hogs
making free of my pasture. It is particularly easy for them to
come in when the pigs' owners slip in by night and cut my fences.
The owners reason, I suppose, that I have acorn and pine mast
going to waste, but do not take into account that while their
pigs would be welcome to feed on the mast, it is not desirable
from my point of view that they also root up all the grass in my
cows' pasture.</p>

<p>There are two sets of hogs in the pasture at the moment. One
set belongs to Mr. Sam Turner, who lives fourteen miles away, and
it does not seem likely that he would travel so far to cut my
fence. The other set belongs to a neighbor. Neither seems likely
to have appropriated my pasture. An alternative suggested itself
to me lately. I wished to go down to the lake edge and determine
for myself the fence cutting, reported by Little Will. Martha
dissuaded me. The lake was too high, the approach to the fence
was too boggy for me to attempt it. I should put on boots and
breeches, then. Martha drew a lurid picture of the pitfalls. The
suspicion came to me that perhaps Little Will had an interest in
the invading stock; that the fences were not cut at all; that if
they were cut, perhaps a third party with whom the Mickens family
might not be on good terms, had done it, and the Mickenses knew
that on my arraignment of my neighbor and Mr. Sam Turner, the
guilty party would come to light, yet the Mickenses would not
bear the onus of having accused him. It came to me, too, that we
have been peaceful at the Creek for an unnaturally long time. The
Mickenses love nothing better than for me to take the war-path,
and, tired of the quiet, may have cooked up the whole story for
the fun of seeing me start a fight.</p>

<p>Even when the neighbors' hogs are not inducted into my
pasture, they disturb me. Last year Bert Ergles turned a drove of
them loose at the Creek, on the strength of having rented one of
Joe Mackay's fields for raising squash. Bert's hogs developed a
passion for my front yard fence line. They dug nests under my
oleanders, they rooted under my spider lilies, they made a
shambles of my coral honeysuckle. I decided this time to settle
the matter legally. I bought all the hogs at above the market
price, sold them at a loss, and thought the matter ended. This
year, Bert has hogs on the road again. I feel a certain sympathy
for them. They must feed wherever they are turned loose to feed,
and if the pickings are poor, they must make the best of it. They
breed, produce young, and are lucky to survive. This spring I
looked out from the veranda and saw an unhappy sight. A lean sow
was being serviced by a boar. The young of her previous litter
seized the moment of her immobility to nurse. I spoke of it to
Norton, mentioning that the sow had a thoughtful aspect.</p>

<p>"Of course she was thoughtful," he said. "She was thinking,
'This is just a vicious circle.'"</p>

<p>With all the trees and fence-posts at the Creek to rub
against, the migrant hogs run squealing to use the rickety post
that holds my rural mail-box. They take turns, crowding and
pushing, and the post teeters precariously. I am the Miss Betsy
Trotwood of Cross Creek, and as the mail-box rocks and sways, I
cry, "Pigs! Pigs! Pigs!" My dog Pat leaps the cattle-gap to harry
them, Little Will comes running with his hoe, and sometimes
Martha comes with great dignity and waves her apron at them.</p>

<p>"Martha," I said, "why do they choose my mail-box post to rub
against? Why must they root under my oleanders and lilies? Why
are they so sure the rooting is better on the wrong side of the
fence?"</p>

<p>"Sugar," she said, "that is a hog."</p>

<p>The rambling range cows on the road are intrusive, too, but
only on occasions, and these are invariably in the spring, when
new grass excites them more intensely, I think, than their
mating. Love comes and goes, and a casual bull will appear at the
proper moment, but the first tender spring grass is a vital
matter. The cows, thin from the winter's poor forage, eye my
yard, bright green still with its winter rye, gather together
their clumsy bodies and sail over my fence. My own cattle have
given me quite as much trouble as those of the neighbors. I have
had a varying succession of cows, calves and heifers and all have
been troublesome. I did not help the situation when I accepted a
male Jersey calf from a friend who owns a dairy. The calf was
engaging when young, like all young things. His first solid food
after he was weaned was a mouthful of allamanda bloom, so of
course I named him Ferdinand. He came daily to the kitchen door
for a bit of brown sugar. He was great friends with Old Jib the
cat, and washed the cat's enraptured face with his rough tongue.
Then over-night, it seemed, the calf had disappeared and
Ferdinand was a very large bull of ferocious tendencies. He came
of breeding age and I told Little Will that I wished the two
cows, Dora and Lady, to be bred at intervals, so that I should
have milk and cream and butter through the year, and not all at
once in a useless superfluity. Will saw the wisdom of the
arrangement. When Dora and Lady came in season simultaneously,
and it was time for one to be bred and the other shut up, Little
Will was beyond wisdom.</p>

<p>Will and Dora and Lady had all chosen Saturday afternoon for
their respective flings. Little Will was gone and out of reach.
Ferdinand and his amours were at my doorstep. The first I knew of
it, Dora had coyly leaped the pasture fence and was eating
asparagus fern from in front of the veranda. I went on with my
work, meaning to drive her back a little later. I looked up from
the typewriter to see Ferdinand charging into the yard. I was
appalled by his size. I had not been close to him since he was a
yearling. He had then taken grass as usual from my fingers,
chewed it a moment, rolled his eye, pawed the earth, given a low
bellow, and made for me.</p>

<p>"He don't like womens no more," Little Will said. "Jes'
cow-womens."</p>

<p>I had left Ferdinand strictly alone, keeping up what I had
hoped were superficially friendly relations by speaking to him
cordially whenever I walked past his gate. He had not
reciprocated. Now he was a mammoth thing, peering at me from the
veranda steps a foot away. I recalled that a sportsman's magazine
had taken a poll on the most dangerous animals in the country,
and the Jersey bull was at the head of the list. I saw a cluster
of Creek children coming down the road with their buckets for
milk. I called to them that Ferdinand was loose in the yard and
to go home. Martha came from the back of the house to tell me
that she was afraid we need not look for Little Will back before
morning. I warned her to return to the tenant house through the
back of the grove. Ferdinand crashed through the blue plumbago
along the front of the house and chased Dora around the
bird-bath.</p>

<p>"Ferdinand so mannish," Martha said proudly.</p>

<p>He seemed only to be doing his duty by Dora. He was much more
interested in the coral honeysuckle and the orange blossoms. He
fed greedily. The honeysuckle vines would have no more bloom this
spring. Suddenly he took care of Dora and marched away, bored
both with domesticity and the honeysuckle, toward the barn. It
occurred to me that he was remembering his young days of being
fed there. It occurred to me too that if ever a bull was likely
to be in a quiet mood, it would be at this moment. It was
necessary that the cows be milked. Their calves were only two
months old, and the cows were in full milk, their bags bursting.
Lady saved me time by coming through the gap Ferdinand had made
in the fence, and joining the family. The two calves, Chrissy and
Cissy, galloped after her from the grove where they were allowed
to run free. I was tempted to let the calves do the milking, but
there were gallons more than they could drain. I opened the gate
of the milking lot and Ferdinand filed in haughtily, his harem
trailing behind him.</p>

<p>I dashed to the feed barrels in the barn and brought out two
brimming bucketfuls. Ferdinand took one as his mannish right and
I divided the other between Dora and Lady. I tried to drive
Chrissy and Cissy into their own stall, but they were excited by
the family gathering and would not be driven. I was working
against time and I dragged their trough into the lot and filled
it. They fed happily side by side, their small tails twitching.
By the time I had them settled, Ferdinand had finished his bucket
and was pawing a warning cloud of earth. I brought him another.
Dora and Lady had now finished theirs.</p>

<p>Martha and Idella came cautiously outside the lot and I
commissioned them to bring feed in relays and hand it over the
fence to me. I milked literally in circles. We milled about
together in the small lot, Ferdinand, Dora, Lady, the two calves,
the feed and I. I milked first on one cow and then the other,
according to the convenience and practicability of their
positions, especially in relation to Ferdinand. A quart was as
much as I could get at a time, when it was necessary to rush to
the fence for a bucket of feed. I made no pretense of stripping
them. I decided that if my getaway proved embarrassing, I should
fling the milk bucket over the fence and follow it. I heard a
groan behind me. Ferdinand, his great belly bulging, had dropped
to his knees to rest. I was able to make a dignified exit through
the gate. I looked back to see Dora and Lady licking Ferdinand's
face, consoling him for the head-of-the-household efforts that
had so exhausted him.</p>

<p>Martha made fierce African threats against the missing Will.
If only, I said, we did not have to go through the same thing
again in the morning. The next morning the red-birds sang, the
game cock crew and the Mallards quacked cheerfully in the bright
spring sunshine. There was no song in my heart and Martha
muttered direly. We walked cautiously toward the lot. It was
plain that Ferdinand was now past female handling.</p>

<p>Martha said, "Praise the Lord!"</p>

<p>I looked where she pointed.</p>

<p>Down the road came a figure. Little Will was coming home.</p>

<p>"Sugar," Martha said, "if that was our President comin' down
the Creek road, he couldn't look no better."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c19">19. <i>Summer</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Folk who have never known a tropical summer have never
luxuriated in indolence, while the world around them burst out of
its sheath in a mad exuberance of growth. It is at the Creek as
though Nature said to us, "You have toiled for me, now rest
quietly in the shade, and the sun and rain and I will do all that
is needed." The bees have slowed from their orgy in the orange
blossoms and the pale gold honey is ready for gathering. They
work leisurely, dipping into the long heavy sprays of the
palmetto bloom, stabbing carelessly the pink tarflowers, the
gallberries, the andromeda, and what may be left over of flowers
in the garden. They know there will be long months of sweetness
and there is no longer any hurry. Once I cut a spray of late
stock with a gold and black fellow so lazy in it that he allowed
himself to be brought into the house with the bouquet. The swarm
of wild bees in a dead sweet gum at the edge of the lakeside
hammock flies slowly back and forth, for their pantry is already
full. The crepe myrtle beside the bird-bath explodes into Roman
candles of bloom and showers of rosy blossoms fall hour after
hour into the water, so that the red-birds and doves and
mockingbirds emerge covered with flowers from their bathing. The
scarlet hibiscus and the yellow allamanda bloom side by side,
gaudy but not dissonant, and butterflies of the same colors
flutter in to drink from them. The yellow lotus blooms on
Micanopy marsh and a small black boy will wade out barelegged and
gather an armful for a dime. I have lain on my veranda and asked
no more of the summer day than to watch, one by one, the lotus
petals falling.</p>

<p>The humming-birds come in, to stand on their heads in the red
hibiscus cups, to sit like minute bright twigs on the tips of
orange boughs, to poise, motionless except for the vibrating
wings, outside the screen and stare at me. One day I selfishly
picked all the hibiscus blossoms and put them in a bowl on the
veranda table. A humming-bird tried to dart through the screen to
come at them. His needle-bill caught in the wire and I loosened
it gently. He flew away and perched on the fence and shook
himself and tried to adjust his mind to invisible barriers.
Martha calls them the June birds. The baby lizards are born from
the eggs under the steps and emerge violently, one inch of body
and one inch of tail, all youthful energy, not having learned
with their parents that there is no hurry, and all things come to
lizards who wait.</p>

<p>We have little advance news of summer. One day it is spring,
with the air cool and the buds still opening. The next, it is
summer, and the sun is very close to the earth, and the red-birds
lift their wings and open their bills to cool themselves. They
seem to discover newly the bird-bath and instead of taking a
casual wetting, splash themselves all over for minutes at a time.
They are angry when the water has not been changed and is too
warm, and fly back and forth across the yard, scolding human
thoughtlessness. When fresh cool water is put in the bath, the
word goes out, and a dozen are there, scattering the water for
yards around.</p>

<p>I leave the oranges unpicked on the trees in the yard around
the house, to have them for ornaments through the summer. They
are dead ripe and over-sweet and the woodpeckers come to them.
They drill through the golden rinds and feed briefly on the
nectar, then fly a few feet away to puncture a fresh orange. The
bees and wasps cluster at the neat small holes and in a day or
two these oranges drop to the ground. They fall with a heavy
thud, bursting open, and the game rooster runs to the feast and
calls his hens and the hens in turn cluck to their biddies.
Nothing is left but the rind and within a week it has been
absorbed into the soil. Nothing is wasted.</p>

<p>We do some work, for the ravens cannot be counted on to drop
food in our mouths. But even the Negroes, who spend the summer
hoeing and pruning, work as slowly and rhythmically as the bees,
pulling the hoe toward them with an even, easy motion, cutting
out the dead orange wood with long-spaced snips of the pruning
shears. They wear Prussian blue work shirts and the shirts are
the same color as the sky. In other seasons they may buy
ready-made cigarettes, but in the summer they roll their own, for
the rolling takes many minutes, and while they are doing it they
lean against the orange trees and rest themselves with long
breaths of the same cadence as the breathing of the fertile
earth. They take a long siesta at noon, and it would be a cruel
white man who would rise from his own to hurry them from where
they lie in the shade, hats over their eyes, immobile as only the
primitive can be.</p>

<p>The corn is rank, the cowpeas are knee-high, the peanuts are
forming small nodules under the earth, and only a light working
is needed for all of these, the mule moving in a dream down the
rows, the Negro behind him guiding the plow deep in the same
lethargy. At night there is singing in the Mickens house, for the
slow time is the time for song, and Little Will's guitar is
strummed softly, the sound as soft as the summer air. The
whippoorwills go mad, and in the moonlight, the mocking-bird, who
has been silent all day in the sun, tears his throat apart to
make a melody. One night he imitates the red-bird, another he
makes up a new tune all his own. Edward Bok imported English
nightingales for the bird sanctuary at Bok Tower. The caretaker
told me that the nightingales died, for lack of the proper food
or perhaps for homesickness, but meantime the mocking-birds had
learned their song. It was even lovelier, he said, than that of
the nightingales.</p>

<p>There is time in summer to lie idly on the veranda and observe
a thousand minute things that through the busier part of the year
have gone unnoticed. There is time to study such things as the
motion of birds and I found that I could identify various birds
at a great height or distance by their flight alone. The soaring
of the buzzard is unmistakable and the wheeling of an eagle is
almost identical. Yet when a bald-headed eagle is so high in the
sky that the distinguishing mark of the white head is invisible,
one who has watched both birds can identify them each from the
other. Something about the eagle's circling is more purposeful
than that of the buzzard. The great wings lie in a straighter
line on the air, without so much of uptilted curve. He is no more
graceful than the buzzard but the hallmark of the fighting
aristocrat is on the flight of one and that of the lazy scavenger
on the other.</p>

<p>Too far down the fence row of coral honeysuckle to distinguish
whether I am seeing a bird or a dragon-fly, the humming-bird
reveals himself by his swinging arcs. It is as though he were
suspended on an invisible wire and swung only to its limits. The
woodpeckers, too, seem to be motivated by puppets' strings and
drop jerkily a few feet down a tree-trunk, only to be jerked back
up again. When they fly, they open and close their wings and
propel themselves like a boy with one foot on a scooter.</p>

<p>The little ground doves fly as though uncertain of themselves,
like apprentice birds learning the business. They take off with a
whirring of tiny rose-lined wings, achieving the safety of the
crepe myrtle with a spasmodic effort. I perpetually expect them
to miss the bough they have aimed for and topple indignantly to
the ground, for they flutter nervously as they land. The large
turtle doves on the contrary fly with such speed and directness
that they seem like gray bullets shot from a long-range gun. They
are hurled across space and when they light in the pecan trees it
is as though the limbs had halted them abruptly and they are only
caught and tangled there. A covey of quail explodes like a pan of
popcorn popping and I can recognize the spasmic scattering far
across the grove.</p>

<p>The great blue heron often flies at great heights and labels
himself plainly with his slow flapping. The ibis, known at the
Creek as the curlew, flies almost as slowly but his head is
carried higher and the wing-beat is more frequent. It is a rare
sight to see a flock of perhaps twenty circling in the sky. I
suppose this community uncertainty is an indication of a mass
migration to new feeding or roosting grounds. I have seen a flock
wheel for hours in an endless circle over the grove, like a
merry-go-round that cannot be halted.</p>

<p>The most engaging of bird flights to my notion is that of the
red-birds. They seem to take life very lightly and in motion they
give an effect of haphazard gayety. They seem not to fly of their
own volition, but, scatterbrained, to be tossed from tree to tree
like wind-blown leaves.</p>

<p>When summer comes, our garden flowers are largely done for,
except the roses. These bloom themselves literally to death,
almost the year around, and we usually replace the bushes every
two years, having had more dozens of blooms from them than is
quite reasonable. The wild flowers burst open to fill the breach,
and if any house at the Creek has no bouquet, it is either
because the householder is too comfortably idle to go to the
roadside to gather it or has, merely, a preference for seeing it
in its natural state. The phlox grows maudlin everywhere, red and
pink and lavender and white and yellow, and the small darkies
carry handfuls for their own pleasure as they stroll by my gate.
One season I had an early spring bean crop in the sixteen-acre
field. It was heavily fertilized. When the wild phlox appeared a
few weeks later, it had drawn up the foreign nourishment avidly
and I had acres of phlox as large and fine as any cultivated
variety.</p>

<p>The stretch of flats between the Creek and the village is pink
all summer, first with gallberry and blueberry bloom, then
fetterbush and andromeda, and lastly the showy tarflower. The
individual tarflowers are shell-pink, much the shape of the large
marsh pink, and impregnated with a sticky substance that gives
them their name. The young Negro girls wear them for earrings,
pressing the mucilaginous calyxes against the dark lobes of their
ears.</p>

<p>The Cherokee bean puts up brilliant scarlet spikes from poor
soil. It is always a marvel to me that some of the handsomest
wild flowers grow profusely in the barest places. The magnificent
yellow-fringed orchis and the white-fringed orchis bloom in
August in damp flat-woods where even the scrub range cattle can
find no pasturage. The yellow false foxglove grows like a
cultivated plant in wild parts of the open scrub. The wild
allamanda is a cloth of gold in late July near the Creek fences,
where only myrtle and scrub oak have been before. With the summer
rains come the pink mallows in the ditches and meadow beauty is
riotous in all low wet places. In late August the red wood lily
flames across open pine woods and is as handsome as the new
exotic rubrum lily imported from Africa. The wild hibiscus, or
blazing star, lines the banks of streams and rivers.</p>

<p>Summer is established at the peak of its lushness when the bay
tree blooms. The blossom is a miniature magnolia, with the
fragrance of a rare perfume. A few sprays are immensely
ornamental in the house. There is a mile of bay trees, forming
what we call a bay-head, just before the Creek is reached from
the village. I drive or walk slowly past them, for they are flung
tangibly from out a dream.</p>

<p>May is the dividing line, when there is one, between spring
and summer. In June, in a normal year, the rains begin. With the
new moisture, the orange trees remember the spring again and put
out a second burst of blossoms that we call June bloom. If cold
has nipped the spring flowering, the June bloom is heavy, and
perhaps our only crop of fruit will come from this. The fruit of
June bloom is coarse-skinned and knotted, more like the wild
oranges. It matures late and seldom loses all its green of color,
and is never the best of citrus.</p>

<p>The rains last usually until mid-August. We wait for them
anxiously, for in the last weeks the elements seem stationary.
The sun seems to stand all day in one steady blazing. May is
sometimes the hottest month of the year. One day in June a cloud
passes over the sun in the late afternoon. The cloud spreads
until all the sky is gray. The air is so still that even the
restless Spanish moss hangs motionless. Although the sun is
hidden the atmosphere is stifling. Then an impalpable breath
stirs. The tallest palms in the east grove bend their heads, the
moss in the hammock lifts as though a silent hand moved through a
gray beard. There is a sibilant sound in the pecan trees, the
grayness thickens, and rain marches visibly across palms and
orange trees and comes in at the gate. Sometimes it is a gentle
shower, sometimes a rushing flood. After it has passed, the air
is as fresh and clean as April and the night will be cool for
sleeping. The sun strikes through the wetness, there is likely to
be a rainbow, and the palms are rosy in the evening light. The
Mallards are vociferous, waddling through the puddles.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is ominous before the rain. I recall a day last
summer, when Adrenna was low in her mind at her failure to find
us a man, and clouds darker than those in the sky rolled across
us. The day was sultry from its dawning. The sky was a sheet of
zinc, against which the sun beat hot and furious hands. The
seedling zinnias and marigolds drooped and finally lay bent
against the earth, sapped and exhausted. At three o'clock in the
afternoon the temperature on the veranda, with the dark slat
blinds drawn, was ninety-eight. The red-birds dabbled indolently
in the warm water of the bird-bath and did not sing. Pat the
pointer dug a futile hole under the guava bushes and lay on his
side, puzzled by his discomfort. Adrenna did not go to the tenant
house, but lingered.</p>

<p>She said, "I aimed to wash me out a few pieces, but seems like
my backbone is melted in the middle."</p>

<p>I said, "Try to rest. No one can work in heat like this."</p>

<p>She said, "'Tain't exactly the heat. It's something in the
air, suckin'."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'll have a rain and things will be better."</p>

<p>She burst out, "You know I been tryin' to make out by myself,
so's not to leave you. God knows I don't want to leave you."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"I been aimin' to tell you. They was tracks around my house
yestiddy. A woman's tracks, with sharp heels."</p>

<p>"They were your own tracks. I haven't been to your house in
weeks. No one has been there."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm feered of. But the tracks is there."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in things like that, Adrenna."</p>

<p>"No'm. I don't believe in such things, neither. But I wisht I
could find me a good root man, to find out is something buried
under my house."</p>

<p>"A cunjur bag?"</p>

<p>"Yessum. I been aimin' to tell you. Last night it cooled off
in the night and I got up and put a quilt over me. This morning
something had drug the quilt off me and dropped it in a heap by
the door."</p>

<p>"You threw it off yourself, in your sleep."</p>

<p>"Yessum. And for three nights now, something been runnin'
through the house at night. And I heered a pistol shot. I turned
up the lamp and when I turned it down again, the pistol shot in
the other corner."</p>

<p>"That was the tin roof crackling when it cooled off. If a
pistol had been shot, I'd have heard it."</p>

<p>"Maybe 'tasn't for your ears to hear."</p>

<p>"Adrenna, nothing like that can harm you."</p>

<p>"No'm, for I ain't et nothing from nobody's hand. But I wisht
I could find me a good root man. I burned sulphur around the
house night before last. But I must of left a gap."</p>

<p>In the west a white cloud rolled itself together and turned
gray. Thunder boomed across the lake. The sound was muffled, as
though the detonation came from under the water. Lightning
flickered like a tongue, then went, tasting the south.</p>

<p>I said, "You'd better milk early. I think we will have
rain."</p>

<p>"Yessum."</p>

<p>I heard her at the pasture gate, calling the cows. Glisson's
bull was bellowing by the lake edge. The cows were stubborn and
took a long time to come. The gray cloud spread as though it were
a great maw, feeding on the sky. It swallowed the last morsel of
blue in the north and the thunder crashed across the swamp. It
was the longest day in the year, but by five o'clock the world
was dark. I heard Adrenna go into the kitchen with the bucket of
evening's milk. On the veranda I walked up and down. Pat whined
at the door and I let him in. Lightning sizzled over the young
grove across the road. I had expected friends that afternoon but
they did not come, kept away perhaps by the ominous skies. City
folk are afraid of the country in a storm. And I, too, was
afraid. At first it annoyed me and I shrugged it off. The thunder
beat closer its invisible drums. I went back to the kitchen to
ask for an early supper. Adrenna sat crouched in a chair, her
arms folded over her face.</p>

<p>She said, "I ain't afeered. But I wisht I knowed is the
sperrits after me."</p>

<p>The spirits were after me, too. I returned to the veranda and
paced up and down, up and down. Adrenna brought my tray and
looked at me.</p>

<p>She said, "Oh, you sick. I kin tell by your face, you
sick."</p>

<p>I was ashamed, for if I failed her, there was no other bulwark
left.</p>

<p>I said, "I'm all right."</p>

<p>She cried out, "I know. You sick at heart. Don't I know. But
please don't cry, else I be in the same fix."</p>

<p>I said, "The rain will be here any moment. You'd better get to
your house before it comes."</p>

<p>I gave her Pat to take with her for company, for her need was
greater than mine. Suddenly the palms rattled their fronds, the
pecan trees bent before a nameless pressure, and the wind and
rain roared in. The rain fell in a flood. I thought of the mother
duck on her nest under the allamanda, where the eaves of the
veranda made only a partial shelter. Her clutch of blue-white
eggs was soft under the thick down of her breast, but her dark
head must be bowed under the force of the torrent. The rain
pounded on the shingled roof and poured in sluiceways at the
house corners. The thunder and lightning were the attacking
cavalry of the enemy. The rain fell for an hour. Then a cosmic
broom swept it away as swiftly as it had come, and there was the
sound only of spent water dripping from the eaves. The thunder
and lightning were routed, and the clouds that held them rolled
away into the north, like dark driven horses. Unbearable, heavy
hands released their pressure from my shoulders. I went out to
the clean washed road and walked a long way along it, and turned
to walk back home again in company with the sunset.</p>

<p>The sun itself was trivial. It sank humbly into a modest bed
of subdued gold. But in the north, the east, the south, cloud
piled on cloud, arrogant with color, luminous with lemon yellow,
with saffron and with rose. Three bands of opal blue lifted
suddenly from the sun. The west took over its own. The unseemly
magnificence of north and east and south faded. The sun at the
horizon came into its full glory and the west was copper, then
blood-red, blazing into an orgy of salmon and red and brass and a
soft blush-yellow the color of ripe guavas. Northeast and south
faded instantly to gray, timid at having usurped the flame of the
sunset. Then suddenly the west dimmed, as though a bonfire
charred and died. There was only a bar of copper. All the sky, to
every point of the compass, became a soft blue and the clouds
were white powder, so that in the end it was tenderness that
triumphed. I went home to sound, cool sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning the world was fresh and bland. The sun shone
benignly, without virulence. Pat romped with Old Jib and the
red-birds trilled from the feed basket. The mother duck came
quacking from her nest for a little corn. A light breeze ruffled
the allamanda.</p>

<p>I said to Adrenna, "What a lovely day!"</p>

<p>She said, "Sho be's fine. I got me a misery in my stomach, but
I feels a whole heap better in my mind. Don't you fret. Ain't no
sperrits goin' to scare me off into leavin' you."</p>

<p>The extraordinary becomes in summer the accepted. Snow and
Little Will kill casually the rattlesnakes in the path of the
mowing machine and only think to mention it if the snake is large
and fine and they inquire whether I shall want the skin. Foxes as
big as small dogs flicker along the fence by night. Raccoons stop
their frog-hunting in the ditches to lift their masked faces to
the car's headlights. An alligator lumbers across the road,
crossing from one lake to the other. A bull 'gator sounds his
vibrating roar from Orange Lake. The hoot owls quaver all night
and a rabbit squeals like a puppy as a varmint pounces on him in
the darkness.</p>

<p>The convict road gangs come through, clearing the weed-choked
ditches and cutting and trimming the right of way. Up the road I
hear the swishing of scythes and the swinging of lazy-boy weed
cutters, then a burst of song. I hear the Negroes sing "I want to
hear my mother--<i>swish-swish</i>--pray--<i>swish</i>--again,"
and they punctuate the song so rhythmically with the sweep of
their cutters that a set of light percussion instruments seems to
be playing with them along the highway. They work evenly and not
too rapidly and the white guards dawdle among and behind them.
The transport and water wagons follow the gang and in the last
wagon sits an enormous bloodhound. He is surrounded by Negroes
idle for the moment and one or two of them always have their arms
lovingly across his great neck. He is very much <i>en rapport</i>
with those whom he is supposed to track down if the occasion
should arise. I am certain they have a complete understanding and
that nothing would induce him to bring one of his good friends to
bay.</p>

<p>One summer day Fred Tompkins and I drove into the scrub and
our car sank hopelessly in hub-deep fine sand. We were not within
fifteen miles of any habitation. We sat a while and estimated our
chances of having a truck drive by. Behind us we heard in the
distance a tumult that resolved itself into a convict road gang
on its way to a new location. The cavalcade of men and mules and
machines came to a stop while the overseer studied our position.
He gave a sign and a swarm of gray-striped black men climbed down
and surrounded us.</p>

<p>"Boys," the overseer said in a quiet conversational tone, "I
want you to take hold of this car and lift Hell out of it."</p>

<p>It was a shocking thing somehow to sit in a large machine and
feel it lifted from the ground and moved forward by man power,
with men's backs and shoulders under it. It was too primitive to
be decent. Yet it was a natural thing. It is fitting in a pioneer
country that men who have offended society should be at the
service of society, which needs so many things done; roads built,
trees hewn, rivers bridged and travellers helped through
impassable trails. Organized labor protests such a use of the
offenders, as an encroachment on legitimate employment. But the
alternative is for men to languish sullen in their cells; and
surely, if we were not so stupid as economic organizers, there
would be work enough for all.</p>

<p>That afternoon we passed the gang at work on the grade. Each
man was driving a span of mules, standing on a small dirt cart or
on a sled that levelled the sand as it moved. The black men drove
like African emperors in chariots. Heads were high, long whips
cracked, and an ebony giant with a blue bandana knotted about his
head broke boastfully into thundering song. Three stations down
the grade another man picked up the irregular melody. The
seething mass of convicts chanted a spasmodic chorus. Harness
clanked, golden dust clouded up behind the scuffling feet of the
mules, black men and their beasts sweat in the heavy summer air.
Songs of love, songs of death, songs of the spirit's hope and the
spirit's despair, overlaid the labors of strong black men
"working for the County." Here and there a white man hobbled
along with chains about his ankles. These were the dangerous
characters, men who had tried to kill their guards or a fellow
convict. We shared our cigarettes, and the dangerous men were as
courteous in their acceptance as the others. So slight a weight
in the balance of character makes a man "good" or "bad."</p>

<p>That night we had supper at the convict camp; boiled beans,
white bacon, soda biscuits, turnip greens, chicory, and syrup to
pour over the biscuits for dessert. A convict named "'Possum"
waited on us. Small fires flickered here and there in the camp.
Lanterns swung under the gray hanging moss. Before we had
finished our supper, the camp was deep in sleep. The men had
finished the day's work and the day's song. None of it seemed
unnatural.</p>

<p>I remember the time I buried my gold, and so preposterous an
accident as came about could only have happened in the summer. In
the spring I knew that I should have the manuscript of a book
completed by August. I wanted to take it myself to New York to
consult over it with my editor. I had a hundred dollars with
which to make the trip. I knew that if I did not put the hundred
dollars in a place more difficult of access than a bank, August
would find it gone. I converted it into five twenty-dollar gold
pieces--this was before even the government began to bury
gold--and I went furtively along the fence toward the lakeside
hammock in search of a hiding place. Under a fence post seemed a
proper spot. I lined up one of the posts with a cedar tree, a
palm and a pecan tree and dug deep. I put the gold in a covered
jelly glass and the glass in a covered coffee tin. I filled in
the hole, patted down the earth, scattered grass over the top,
and went away as contented as a dog who has done an especially
good job with a choice bone.</p>

<p>The summer passed, the manuscript was finished, I was ready to
go. I was to be driven in the grove truck to the village to catch
my train. Somehow, things went wrong that morning, and I was busy
until dangerously late. I decided to bathe and dress, then make a
quick dash to dig up my buried treasure. The day was hot and
steaming. The sun beat down mercilessly and the sand gnats
swarmed and stung. I thrust my spade deep beside the fence post
that lined up with a cedar tree, a palm and a pecan. I dug
deeper. There was nothing there. I backed off and studied the
terrain. Five posts lined up with a cedar tree, a palm and a
pecan. I excavated all five in a frenzy. There was no coffee tin,
there was no jelly glass, there was no gold. I stood dripping and
frustrated in my best clothes. Then I began digging all over
again, three times as deep as I had remembered doing the burying.
Under a fence post that did not appear to line up with anything
at all, my spade struck the disintegrated coffee tin and the
jelly glass, full of water and tarnished gold pieces. I swung on
the train at the last possible instant and paid for my ticket
with money that to all appearances had been buried during the
Civil War, held tightly in a grimy paw. I was wet, dirty and
dishevelled, and neat passengers stared at me.</p>

<p>I longed to say haughtily, "My good people, you have no
conception of the difficulties I have encountered in being here
at all."</p>

<p>I remember, too, a summer when peace and war battled for
possession of the Creek and for all of Florida. The conflict was
grave for us. The enemy was the Mediterranean fruit fly. I
remember that I walked to the sixteen-acre field in search of
wild flowers and stopped at the edge to stare at the wild grape
vines in the hammock around the clearing. The wild grape is a
perfect host for the tropical devastator that had just invaded
its last unconquered continent by way of Florida. If anything
could ruin this peninsula appended to the United States, it
seemed that it would be the Mediterranean fruit fly, the insect
of the agricultural scientists' nightmares, a pest more
destructive to fruits and vegetables than the boll-weevil, the
Japanese beetle, the cotton moth and half a dozen others
combined. Florida has survived the West Indian hurricanes that
brush our coast. It has survived the madness of "the boom." It
has maintained against all enemies its beauty, and at such places
as the Creek, its privacy.</p>

<p>The orange industry has fought and defeated the white fly, the
citrus canker and the periodic freezes. For every abandoned
grove, frozen to the ground in 1895, there are a hundred new
ones, incredibly neat and geometrical. My own grove has survived
the freezes of early vintages, due to its sheltered location
between Orange Lake and Lochloosa. It is supposed to be among the
last to go when the mercury drops into the perilous twenties. My
acres are part of the Arredonda grant, a grant from the crown of
Spain to Don Fernandez de la Maza Arredonda and Son, and it is
said that any land that is part of an original Spanish grant is
good orange land. The Spaniards knew how to choose it, for soil
and protection, out of the unfamiliar hammock.</p>

<p>Indians, Seminoles or mound builders, Spaniards in search of
fabulous riches or still more fabulous youth, fugitives from
justice from the Carolinas, Georgia Crackers seeping slowly over
the border, Yankees with axes to grind, or seeking the sharp
blade of beauty--all the intruders have seen Florida's calamities
threaten them and come and go. Now a small gauzy fly imperilled
the life of the state, and with it, the agriculture of all the
southern states. Florida was a battleground, a Belgium, a Poland.
Four and a half of federal millions and the keenest brains in
modern entomology set in to do battle against the insidious
visitor come without passport from the infested tropics, none
knew how or when, save that the invasion was recent. Military
quarantine was thrown around the infested areas. There were Zones
1, 2 and 3, with corresponding stringency of regulation. In Zone
1, vegetation was stripped down to the unfruiting plants. My
place seemed safely in Zone 3, but we pulled up by the roots, and
burned, the top-of-the-market crop of bell peppers and of
eggplant, perfect fly hosts. I dared not juggle the safety of my
citrus crop and that of Old Boss against the mere amenity of a
summer's income.</p>

<p>Not a ripe orange, grapefruit or tangerine was left that
summer on the trees. The clean-up crew went through half a dozen
times. When we went swimming a few miles away in Cow Pen Pond, we
crossed from Zone 3 into Zone 2, and coming and going a military
guard stopped us at the boundary line. The car was inspected for
fruits and vegetables and thoroughly sprayed. Inspectors
net-worked the state in search of fresh infestations. Doctor
Newell of the University shut himself in his office in Orlando
and studied charts, reports and laboratory findings. Research
scientists worked over-time feverishly, cramming a year's
experimentation into a week, hoping to say, "Such and such will
control the Mediterranean fruit fly." If the fly could be starved
out during the summer, Florida would be safe again, and all the
south-eastern agriculture. But deep in the jungles, out of reach
over the fence lines, were hanging the wild grapes. They were
turning rosy in the summer sun. Wild grapes, the perfect host.
Wild grapes running riot in hundreds of miles of all but
impassable jungle.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Good God, with a bounty<br>
 Look down on Alachua County,<br>
 For the soil is so po' and so awful rooty, too,<br>
 I don't know what to God the po' folks gonna do."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>My friend Fred will not eat a meal, at table, in the woods, or
by the water, without pronouncing this grace. I suggested to Fred
that he amend his prayer, for it seemed for a time that only God
with a bounty could spare Alachua County from the fruit fly. If
the fly reached us, we faced ruin, with the actual menace for the
poorest, of starvation. In Zones 1 and 2, pitiful small crops
were torn up and destroyed. Gray-bearded backwoodsmen with
shotguns threatened Plant Board inspectors, but the necessary
destruction of fields of beans and eggplant and peppers went on;
peaches and citrus and guavas and figs continued to be stripped
from the bushes. The Plant Board was ruthless. But so is the fly.
Many small homes and farms in Zones 1 and 2 were deserted.
Negroes migrated north in search of work.</p>

<p>Doctor Berger of the Plant Board said, "Only a miracle can
save us. If the fly is not yet in the wild fruit--if it has not
reached the wild guavas, the grapes, the wild oranges, the
pawpaws and persimmons out in the jungle hammock lands, there is
a chance--a chance--that we can exterminate it. Otherwise--"</p>

<p>Only the bulletin of the Department of Agriculture, issued
long before on the Mediterranean Fruit Fly in Hawaii, could
picture coldly and dispassionately enough the devastation of that
"otherwise." I read the page-long list of host fruits and
vegetables whose ripe or ripening crop is totally destroyed
within a short space by this light-winged devourer, this
prodigious layer of larva-making eggs, and thought, "But there
are no other fruits and vegetables left!" The inexorable bulletin
summed it up:</p>

<p>"The fruit fly . . . is an insect pest of the first importance
in horticultural development. Practically every fruit crop of
value to man is subject to its attack. No effort . . . is too
great to combat it."</p>

<p>The horticultural development of Hawaii almost entirely ended
after 1910. Florida without agriculture! Without tomatoes, beans,
peppers, eggplant, peas, squash; without its golden-headed glory
of citrus! Georgia without its peaches! For Georgia across the
border quarantined against us and shivered with fear.</p>

<p>The war raged all summer. The next season proved that it was
won, for the fly was never seen again. The first bitter cold
night came in, blessedly cold, for now the incubation would be
halted. We shivered in the icy wind.</p>

<p>"Well," Zelma said, "a Mediterranean fruit fly'd be a fool to
lay an egg tonight."</p>

<p>It seems strange to us at the Creek that any one should think
the Florida summer oppressive as to temperature. Our battles are
the age-old ones against the vagaries of nature, but the season
itself is usually clement. The wind blows all summer from the
Atlantic on the east or the Gulf of Mexico on the west, cooling
itself across either of the great bodies of water, and moves
beneficently across the narrow Florida peninsula. The Florida
summer climate in general is the most delightful I have known. Of
the thirteen summers I have lived at the Creek, two have been
unbearable, two on the uncomfortable side, and the other nine
have been perfection. We look forward to summer, we swim, we
fish, and we fox hunt.</p>

<p>Fox hunting with us is not the elegant northern or English
matter of red-coated masters of fox hounds, expensive mounts and
the serious intent on bringing in the brush. We fox hunt as we do
everything else in the summer, leisurely and comfortably. We are
interested in the chase and in the fox hounds, in the beauty of
the night, and we hope always that the fox will get away so that
we may run him another night. For we fox hunt in Florida of
nights, and added to the delights of the hunt we have the
tropical moonlight.</p>

<p>My friend Nettie Martin introduced me to fox hunting. She is a
curly-headed person, so tiny that she must buy her boots and
breeches in the children's department, and so ardent a lover of
horses and hounds that although she owns neither, she has been an
officer of the state fox hunters' association. She has broken
countless bones, following the hounds on a behemoth of a
stallion, but she is on a horse again as soon as the cast is off.
When I reported seeing foxes near Big Hammock, she induced John
Clardy to bring out his hounds.</p>

<p>The summer moonlight was so bright that we could distinguish
the colors of the markings on the fox hounds. They arrived in a
cage in the back of a truck, their long tails waving for delight
in the nearness of the chase. Hounds are sad, soulful beasts,
their lives darkened by the fact that there is not a fox chase
every night. John let down the door of the cage and they trooped
out decorously, snuffing the earth and waiting patiently for the
"Hie away!" Nettie spoke to each by name; Big Belle, Flora, Sugar
Boy, Black Sam, and on down the line. They acknowledged her
greeting with a dignified eye and an extra swish of the tail. It
is not considered etiquette to make pets of sporting dogs, but
now and then one would brush her as though by accident and her
hand rested for an instant on a lean, loose-hided neck. John
examined the sand for fox tracks, found them and gave the dogs
the signal.</p>

<p>They were away like bullets, voiceless as ghost dogs in the
moonlight. They cut to the north, across scrub palmettos, and
silence followed on the rustling and the soft padding of big
feet. The hunters on horseback lit cigarettes, talked together,
then took the same direction as the dogs, leisurely. I did not
see how any one might hope to see or hear anything of the chase.
My own broken neck was too recent for me to relish the idea of
trotting through the dense growth, treacherous with gopher holes,
where a false step sends horse and rider pitching. I stayed with
the truck and with others cautious like myself. As time passed,
and only the hoot owls sounded, it seemed to me that if the night
were not so beautiful, fox hunting would be the most stupid of
all sports. Then in the distance an old hound gave tongue. I had
thought that talk of the hounds' "voices" and "music" was
nonsense. Old Belle's cry was a deep-toned bell ringing across
the palmettos. A younger dog with a high-pitched voice, known to
the adepts as a "fine" voice, sounded above the lower pitch, and
then the whole pack was in full cry. The harmony was like that of
a Negro choir, the basses deep and rich, the intermediate tones a
solid background, and the one high silver voice like that of a
Negro soprano soaring above the others. The hoot owls hushed in
wonder. The riders crashed back to the road.</p>

<p>Nettie called, "They're headed for the gallberry flats.
Follow."</p>

<p>The truck started and we were plowing across land I should
have considered impossible to cross in any car. But there were
cattle trails and here and there a dim old woods road and we
bounced along. Big Hammock lifted to the right and the sharp
scent of orange leaves came to us on the night air. We heard the
hounds and riders pass near us in the hammock. The hunt doubled
back, and we were abandoned, and the cries faded.</p>

<p>The hunter at the wheel of the truck said casually, "They'll
come back this way. We'll wait here."</p>

<p>It seemed to me then, and on subsequent hunts has still
seemed, a complete miracle that a man should know when and where
a fox would run, and the dogs after. But the great joy to the
hunters lies in this intimate knowledge, and in hearing the
hounds do the proper and clever thing, and in following the
voices of their favorites among the dogs. We waited a long time.
Very late in the night we heard the hounds come closer. The moon
was high overhead, the gallberry bloom was recognizably pink in
the brightness, and the sweetness of bay blossoms came to us from
the thicket. The hunter driver straightened from his
lounging.</p>

<p>"Here he comes," he said.</p>

<p>I had heard no sound of small sharp-pointed feet on the sand,
no rustling even among the harsh leaves of the gall-berries. But
a gray fox slipped past us, so close we might have touched his
back. He was going slowly and his brush was dragging. It seemed
to me that he was done for and I sickened at thought of the kill.
But the dogs were tired, too. They came through on the trail a
moment later, the riders followed, there was a great commotion at
the edge of a bay-head, shouts and then silence. Hounds and
riders came back to the truck.</p>

<p>"He treed," John said. "He's a good fox. We'll run him
again."</p>

<p>The hounds threw themselves on the ground to rest. This is the
time when a roaring camp-fire is built, allowed to die down to
coals, and coffee made and steaks broiled. The hunters smoke and
the bottle is passed and the camp food is nectar and ambrosia.
There is long heated talk of the performance of the hounds and
each man praises one and damns another, until all agree at last
that whatever the merits and voices of the rest, there is no
beating Old Belle. Toward dawn on this night a light fog settled
down over the hammock, the gallberry flats, the bay-heads and the
palmettos. The world was veiled with silver-gray and the moon
struck through it wanly. I went home to sleep. Now and then I
awakened to the music of the pack, for the true fox hunters were
back at the chase, and Old Belle had struck a fresh trail.</p>

<p>The fog of the night was one of our phenomena. We have fog at
two seasons, the heart of winter and the peak of summer. Both
come from the sharp night-cooling of the sun-warmed earth. The
humidity of Florida, surrounded on three sides by water, is
precipitated into fog by the shock of the quick cooling. Spring
and fall seldom produce fog, for the variance of temperature then
is slight. The fog is a combination of beauty and nightmare.
One's personal reaction depends on whether it has proved friendly
or inimical. Summer fog will always be a nightmare to me. Even in
maturity we are conditioned by our experiences, and one sharp
enough leaves an imprint, no less indelible for being understood.
I am not easily frightened, but I was truly afraid the night I
fell asleep at the wheel of my car when a bear hunt was over, and
I drove home afterward to Cross Creek in a summer fog.</p>

<p>Uncle Barney, whose tales I added to those of old Cal Long for
much of my hunting material in <i>The Yearling</i>, invited me to
join him and Hubert for a bear hunt. Hubert had brought us
together in the first place, and the wonderful old man and I were
fast friends. If his favorite name for me was "Old Ugly," he said
it with a twinkle and an affectionate undertone. An invitation to
a hunt with him was a command. The bear hunt was to be west of
the St. John's River and I was to meet the two men at the river
"just before day." I had a fifty-mile drive ahead of me from the
Creek, and figuring "day" in summer at five o'clock, I set my
alarm clock for three in the morning. I distrusted the alarm,
which had sometimes failed me, and did not sleep all night,
listening and waiting. I was up ahead of the alarm. I brewed a
cup of coffee, gathered my duffle and set out. The drive was dark
at first, then acquired luminosity as I became accustomed to the
stars. I drove up to the bridge at Astor a few minutes ahead of
Hubert's car. Uncle Barney came on foot across the bridge from
his house on the river.</p>

<p>We met other hunters from the neighborhood, with dogs, near
Juniper Creek at sunrise. The bear we were after had been making
depredations on nearby stock. We tracked and trailed all morning
through swamp and low hammock, and later I used the details for a
bear hunt in <i>The Yearling</i>. The trail disappeared across
Juniper Run and we gave it up. At least, the neighborhood hunters
gave it up. Uncle Barney did not give up so easily. After our
noon dinner, a baked ham from me, bread and may-haw jelly from
Marsh Harper, coffee from Hubert, cold baked sweet potatoes from
Uncle Barney, the Harpers took their dogs and went away.</p>

<p>Uncle Barney said, "That was a cold trail we were following on
that bear. We'll find us a fresh one."</p>

<p>He found the fresh trail, and I lamented years of
comparatively easy living, following him. He was seventy-six
years old, and he whipped me down. He understood my unvoiced
distress and gallantly assigned me to a futile stand while he and
Hubert went on. There was a twinkle in his old blue eyes when he
said, "Now, girl, don't let that bear trip over you while you're
asleep." I did not sleep, but I stretched out my aching booted
feet and hoped he would not return too soon. In late afternoon
the two men returned. Uncle Barney said, "I believe he'll head
back this way this evening." We climbed into Hubert's car and
drove back to Juniper Creek. Uncle Barney studied days-old
tracks.</p>

<p>"Now, girl," he said, "you go off into that bay-head to the
south and climb a tree and sit there and wait. You're likely to
have that black rascal come out snorting and puffing and feeding
right under your feet."</p>

<p>They left me and I pushed my way through dense undergrowth to
the bay-head. There was a half-fallen pine tree there, inclining
at an angle, and I climbed up it and took my stand some twenty
feet above the terrain. The perch was comfortable. The sun was
setting. Under me was a tight thicket. A light rain fell, like a
gauze veil between me and the sun. A red-bird and two bluebirds
flew to the bay tree beside me and preened their feathers among
the bay blossoms in the mist. I sat very still. The birds cocked
bright eyes at me and went on with their toilets. The thin shower
ended and a rainbow arched across the sky. The birds flew
leisurely a little distance away. The bay blossoms were nacre,
with diamond drops at their centers. I hoped the bear would not
come, not in fear, for he would be too easy a shot. I decided
that if he came I should shoot high over him and simply face
Uncle Barney with the news that I had missed. The last red and
orange faded from the sky, the rainbow and the birds were gone,
and when it was dark, Uncle Barney and Hubert called me from the
far road.</p>

<p>That night was moonlit and we drove all night through the
scrub. Night hunting is illegal, properly so.</p>

<p>Uncle Barney said, "I wouldn't hunt deer at night. But if one
was to attack me, I'd have to protect myself."</p>

<p>We saw no deer. We saw no bear. Hubert and Uncle Barney did
not know that I was passionately willing the creatures, "Don't
come!" We drove Uncle Barney home across the river, and Hubert
and I got into our separate cars. It was three o'clock in the
morning. I had been without sleep more than forty hours. All day
I had fought my way behind Uncle Barney through swamp and
hammock, bay-heads and oak thickets, through horse briers and
bull briers. With no special consciousness of fatigue, I suddenly
fell dead asleep behind the wheel of my car. I awoke with a jolt,
headed at a high speed for the ditch. I swung the car sharply,
bounded toward the opposite ditch, swung back again, and cleared
the four-foot ditch to the left so clean that there was never any
mark of the tires to show that I had crossed it. If I had not
quail-hunted with Fred Tompkins in his Ford across black-jack and
pine-woods, mowing down small trees, dodging gopher holes, I
think it would not have occurred to me to try to steer my way
through the forest in which I found myself. I dodged the larger
trees and crashed across the smaller. I dared not put on brakes.
I ripped past large pines and flattened down saplings. I came to
a stop across a ten-foot palmetto.</p>

<p>I climbed out to investigate the damage. The left side of my
car was crushed. The motor was still running, but the left front
fender was jammed in over the wheel so that I had no play and
could not move the car. I turned on my parking lights so that I
could find the car again and walked back to the highway. There
was no traffic at that hour of the morning. I had walked two
miles back toward the Ocklawaha River when a car passed and I
flagged it down with my flashlight. The driver took me back. My
car lights were ominous, deep in the woods. When we could find no
marks where the car had leaped the ditch, the stranger suspected
a trap and was reluctant to go in with me. When I pointed out the
first pine tree past which I had ripped my way, he knew I had
told the truth. I had an axe in my car and with it he cut down a
sapling to use as a prize-pole to lift the damaged fender a
little away from the wheel. Between us we freed the wheel enough
so that I could drive the car.</p>

<p>I was obliged to drive home to the Creek at no more than ten
miles an hour. After the shock it seemed to me that it would be
impossible ever to sleep again. Yet as I turned from the village
down the four-mile stretch to the Creek, the deadly fatigue
overtook me and it was all I could manage, talking to myself,
singing, to keep my eyes open. Then I met the fog. It was a
soporific enemy. It lay over the hollows like a ghostly trap. I
drowsed. I stirred. The fog lay no higher than the car, but it
was a morass. Again and again I dropped into exhaustion, and
roused out of it with a fearful rushing feeling. The fog was
about me and I was plunging blindly into it, and imaginary trees
closed in on me, and the road ended, and I was doomed, and I got
a grip on myself and there was still open road, smothered with
the fog. I minded especially the rushing feeling--a drowning man
would feel so. I reached Cross Creek and went to bed. And all
that night, and for weeks after, a road swam ahead of me and
suddenly ended, and the trees poured in on me, and I was damned
in the fog. I still dream sometimes of rushing to destruction
through the mist, and I think that for me summer fog will forever
be a nightmare.</p>

<p>I was struck, with Harper's bear dogs on the hunt, as with
John Clardy's fox hounds, by the sharp line drawn between house
dogs and work dogs. Florida hunters believe that any dog allowed
the run of the house cannot be made a good sporting or working
dog. I cannot agree. I make companions of my pointers and take
them with me in my car. It seems to me that my Mad Pat, for
instance, hunts with even greater enthusiasm and earnestness than
kennel dogs I have known, through his delight in sharing the hunt
with me and his desire to please me. Discipline of course must be
strict and business-like and must begin with the puppy. Because
of this, I did once a cruel thing to a work dog whose path
crossed mine.</p>

<p>The dog and I first met on a warm June evening. I was walking
east along the Creek road, a little later than usual. The sun had
set. I remember feeling lonely. I was a little uneasy, as well,
for the moccasins and rattlers cross the road in the twilight. A
ramshackle car came out from the lane that leads to Cow Hammock
and turned toward the village. A dog followed it. He ran with the
dejection of the forsaken. He was not noticed. A half-mile ahead
he stopped disconsolately and began to trot back toward home. I
saw that he was of a tawny yellow. He had something of the build
of the Belgian police dog. As he came closer, I became aware of
his mixed breeding. A black and alien smudge ran down his nose,
and his long tail was ignominiously curled, revealing the
mongrel. He trotted with a wolflike purpose.</p>

<p>I called to him with some uncertainty as to his nature. The
yellow dog stopped. He came to me. I held out my hand and he
snuffed it. I touched his rough coat. I pulled one ear. He rubbed
his nose briefly against me in a gesture of acceptance. A feeling
of friendliness passed over us in the dusk.</p>

<p>I said, "Come, boy," and he turned and walked with me.</p>

<p>It was good, after long months without a dog of my own, to
have him beside me. He left me in a few minutes and went ahead,
but the link between us was unbroken. Now and then he stopped and
looked back, to be sure that I was following. Once he came to me
to be touched; to be reassured that we were, truly, together.
Studying him, I saw that he was a working dog; the catch-dog, it
proved, of my new neighbor in Cow Hammock, who used him to round
up his vagrant hogs. The business dog has his own ear marks. He
is self-contained. He expects no luxuries of life, no
graciousness. He possesses usually a simple integrity. He does
his work faithfully and well and takes his pan of cornbread and
an occasional bone, not with gratitude, but with the dignity of
one who knows he has earned, that day, his keep. His gratitude is
reserved for the rare expression of friendliness such as I had
given him. That first night he ran well ahead of me and up his
home lane, not taking too much for granted the closeness of our
relation.</p>

<p>The next day I set out up the road in the late afternoon. I
passed the entrance to Cow Hammock.</p>

<p>I called, "Here, boy! Here!"</p>

<p>I expected no response and there was none. I was halfway to
Big Hammock when a clicking sound on the gravel road caught my
ear. The yellow catch-dog was running to overtake me as though
his life depended on it. I waited for him and he bounded about me
with the joy of the alien who comes at last to his own. I was as
glad as he. We walked that evening in a great content and that
time he did not turn up his lane until I passed it with him.
After that he waited for me with a faithful regularity. If I went
early, I might have to call. Invariably he heard and joined me as
soon as he could leave his business. If I went late, he was
waiting at the lane. A few strokings of his head and he was
satisfied. He went ahead, not far, looking back often over his
curled and shameful tail.</p>

<p>Sometimes we romped together. We enjoyed most the game with
the bull-bats. We stalked them together. They have a trick of
sitting bright-eyed in the road, waiting for the approach. At the
last instant they take off, circling to swoop low over their
pursuer's head. It is a good game of tag. The yellow dog beat me
at it. Often, a bull-bat too sure of himself all but lost his
tail feathers. When this happened, the catch-dog raced joyfully
around and around, or chased a quite imaginary rabbit.</p>

<p>One evening we loitered, for the approaching night was hot and
sultry. As we turned west again, the last red stain of sunset
faded from the sky and the road was dark. The catch-dog walked
slowly beside me. Suddenly he stiffened. He made a sound, half
growl, half moan, deep in his throat. Then he backed against me.
I became aware that he was pushing me with his strong
hindquarters, moving me away as deliberately as though he
possessed an arm with which to do so. I backed with him to the
far side of the road. On the gray gravel what had been a wide
shadow resolved itself into a large rattlesnake that slid now
into the grass. The catch-dog and I quivered, for the blood
curdles instinctively at such an encounter in the dark. We
hurried the rest of the way. Then and afterward we were joined by
the closeness of those who, together, have escaped a danger.</p>

<p>One night I heard him being beaten for having gone away when
he was wanted. Once he failed me, when an outlaw boar was being
cornered. I heard the shrill squealings of the hog and knew that
the catch-dog was at his work. He came later to my gate, as
though to show me that his failure to join me was not of his
intention. He did this sometimes, too, when circumstances kept me
from my walking. Otherwise he did not intrude on my life of
which, he recognized, he was not a part.</p>

<p>Some weeks after we began our jaunts together I was given the
high-bred pointer puppy for which I had been waiting. The puppy
was captivating. I devoted myself at once to his care and
training. I wanted to raise the handsome young fellow as a
companion, so that I was especially anxious to discipline him
firmly from the beginning. I ended my evening walks down the
highway, going about the grove instead. The puppy was not yet
broken to go to heel and I could not risk the distraction of the
catch-dog, a rabbit chaser, to disturb his training. Two or three
days later the yellow dog came to my gate, wagging his tail. I
ignored him and he went away.</p>

<p>A week later I took my young pointer on a leash. We passed the
entrance to Cow Hammock. Passing, the catch-dog must have scented
us, for some distance on he came after us on the gallop. He was
insane with joy. He jumped against me, he went taut proudly,
introducing himself to the puppy. He dropped his forelegs to the
ground and shook his head, inviting the new dog to play. The
puppy barked shrilly and tugged at the leash. Discipline was
hopeless. There was nothing for it but to drive the catch-dog
away. I made a menacing gesture. He looked at me unbelieving and
did not stir. I picked up a handful of light gravel and threw it
in his direction and went on, dragging the puppy behind me. The
catch-dog followed. He watched me with bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>I shouted with as much sternness as I could manage to bring
from a sick heart, "Get back!" and he stopped and made no further
effort to go with us. On the way home, we passed him, lying at
the Cow Hammock entrance, his head on his paws. He fluttered his
tail a little, as though in hope that I did not, could not, mean
my rejection of him. The pointer and I hurried by.</p>

<p>Now we pass as though we were strangers. I am ashamed to face
him, having used him in my loneliness, and then betrayed him. He
shows no signs of recognition. His tail curves over his back. He
trots with a high head, looking straight ahead. He is a work dog,
and he must be about his business.</p>

<h2><a name="c20">20. <i>Fall</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Somehow "autumn" does not seem properly used of Florida. There
is a connotation in the word of flaming color, of sharp change,
of hoar frost heavy on cornfields, of all of northern harvest.
The sub-tropical fall is so impalpable, so much a protraction of
summer, pendulous before the time of winter fruiting, that we
might almost say that we have no such season. As with spring, we
change our habits not so much in relation to a calendar month, as
according to the storms, which are only relatively equinoctial.
Our summer temperatures are seldom extreme, never reaching the
100's and above as elsewhere in the country. But when the summer
rains have ended, we sometimes have a temperature maintained in
the 80's for many weeks, and the steadiness, through August and
perhaps all of September and even into October, becomes wearing,
like the ancient torture of the dropping of water on the
head.</p>

<p>The sky is a glaring blue, too blue and cloudless, the
red-birds no longer sing, the rank summer vegetation turns sere,
and the sun goes down in a burning ball. The sand is powder and a
fine dust rises from it and coats the roadside bushes. In a
temperate climate, this would be a part of summer. Here, it means
summer's end. Even the sturdy zinnias curl and shrivel. The pecan
trees, water-loving, draw up within themselves and their pointed
leaves are crisp. At this time, flocks of diminutive drab birds
sift into the pecan trees, and cling there like dead leaves blown
by a dry wind. The palm fronds are without luster. The doves
mourn plaintively and the sound is tiresome.</p>

<p>The second week in September I gamble on the season and plant
most of my seed-beds. The broccoli will probably survive in any
case, but if the storms with their rain do not come soon, the
parsley and lettuce will never germinate, nor can I bring through
my seedling flowers, African daisy, gypsophilia, forget-me-not,
schizanthus, stock, larkspur, calendula and the rest, for my well
water is harsh and the delicate plants resent it. At the Creek we
all watch for signs of change. When the dog fennel blooms, we
count that it will be forty days until frost. When the curlews
wheel, high in the sky, we are despondent, for they are called
the dry-weather birds, and the circling flocks indicate that the
fall rains are a long time away. The golden rod is no help to us,
for it is not a fall flower here, but blooms in August or even in
July. We listen hopefully for the big bull alligator in Orange
Lake, prophesying change, and watch for the poor-Joe flying, for
the bird is the best of weather prophets. We eye the Spanish moss
for the direction of the wind, for as long as the wind is from
the east there will be no rain. One fall when the storms were
late and a long drought was holding up the fall planting of truck
crops, the village held a meeting to pray for rain.</p>

<p>One of the town patriarchs arose to say, "You-all jest as good
to pray for the heathen, or pray Jim Wilkins'll git sober, or ary
thing but rain. You know good and well hit ain't a-goin' to rain
until the wind changes."</p>

<p>The Negroes are depressed and pass the blues on to me, and I
begin to put stock in Martha's voodoo. She comes for long
mournful conferences and tells of the friend who vomited up a
snake, and the one whose husband was tolled away from her, and
had to be tolled back by getting some hairs from his head and
burying them with other items under the house. She tells me how
to make a cunjur bag, and how difficult it is to get all the
ingredients together. The principal one is the right bone from a
black cat. The cat must be black all over, without the faintest
trace of white. It must be boiled alive in an iron pot until the
meat falls from the bones. The bones must be thrown into a
running stream, and the bone that floats upstream is the one that
holds the magic. I spilled some potassium of permanganate
crystals and Martha threw up her hands in horror when she saw
them, and inquired if I were making fumble-dust. I came across
the word "fomb&eacute;" in the book on Haitian voodoo by the
Florida Negress, Zora Neale Hurston, and it seemed to me that the
Haitian "fomb&eacute;" must surely be Martha's fumble-dust.</p>

<p>I listen to Martha now, not over-riding her, when she refuses
to clean out the fireplaces on a Friday. Through the summer
guests have thrown matches and cigarettes untidily into the
fireplaces, but if Martha says that Friday is an unlucky day for
removing them, I agree, for a sense of ill luck hangs over
us.</p>

<p>"Us was maybe born to good luck," she says gloomily, "but bad
luck done overtakened us."</p>

<p>We are careful to throw onion peelings into the wood range,
and not to throw peanut hulls out of the door, to prevent the
quarrelling that could so easily arise in the tenseness. We do
not sweep anything out of the door after sunset, to avoid
catastrophe. Who is there to object? Who could be standing
outside the door after the sun goes down, to mind being swept on?
Yes, but who couldn't be? I thought I heard feet going down the
porch steps in the early morning.</p>

<p>Martha said, "That was the night-folks goin' away."</p>

<p>It is probably the night-folks who don't like to be swept on.
If I were a night-folk, I should hate it.</p>

<p>There is an unexpected treat of jellied chicken in the icebox.
It was made, with no need at the moment of jellied chicken, from
a fine fat hen. The hen in this evil time was foolish enough to
crow on the yard. Martha said we could not have it. Anathema to
men, and bad luck to boot, are a whistling woman and a crowing
hen. Every one in the tenant house goes down with malaria. The
doctor calls it malaria, but Martha knows better. When I built an
addition to the tenant house, so that Martha and Old Will could
move back here to live for the rest of their lives, I used new
lumber. If you add new wood to old, you may as well begin saving
up for medicine, for all in the house will be ill. I should have
remembered, for I paid for both my bathrooms, made of shiny new
pine against the old weathered house, with trips to the hospital.
Martha thinks that I learn very slowly.</p>

<p>Out in the grove hangs a hawk-repeller. It is the
spread-eagled body of the last hawk shot, strung between two
poles, with a gin bottle hung at its neck. It did not have to be
a gin bottle. It had to be a bottle, to catch the sun, and I
happened to have a gin bottle handy. As Gertrude Stein would say,
if it had to be a bottle it had to be a bottle and a bottle is a
bottle and a gin bottle is a bottle. The macabre affair sways and
glints in the sun and there has not been a hawk in sight since
Martha and I put it up. I could not say how much of a moral
lesson the hawks take from it. I doubt whether they associate
humans with gin and gin with sin. But the bottle does shine in
their eyes and they see a very dead fellow hawk and they think
the grove must be a good place to avoid. At any rate, with the
rains held up, it is no time for me to quibble.</p>

<p>At the back of the farmhouse a dead chicken snake hangs in the
crotch of a grapefruit tree. This is not, as might be supposed,
to keep away other chicken snakes. It is for the all-important
purpose, late in a dry September, of inducing rain. Very often,
it works. I should never dream in a dry time of burying a
freshly-killed snake. I hang it in the crotch of a tree and
usually it makes rain. It is possible that snakes, like turtles,
crawl ahead of a rain, and that it would have rained anyway.
Facts are ineffably simpler than explanations. Sometimes we have
a false shower in the morning, a few futile drops, and Martha
says, "A mornin' rain is like an old woman's dance--soon
over."</p>

<p>If a limb breaks from a tree, says Martha, and no wind is
stirring, it is a sign of death. This is plausible enough, for it
may mean that in the great battle between creation and
destruction there comes an instant when the forces of
disintegration are strong, and if they can work on a tree, why
may they not in the same moment strike at a life? Martha's
insistence that if a cow lows in the late hours of the night,
that morning you will hear of a death <i>somewhere</i>--if
somebody doesn't come to tell you, she says, you'll read of it in
the paper--is one of those generalized prophecies that cannot
fail of fulfillment, for I suppose there has never been a morning
paper without an obituary. Death does take an occasional holiday
in a small area, being no doubt busy elsewhere, and perhaps
Martha meant that in such an instance he would be at work in
one's own vicinity, for the Negro world of the body is a small
one. It is only their spiritual geography that reaches far, out
to the deep rivers and the spaces where the Lord watches the
sparrow's fall along with the courses of the stars, and a man,
black or white, must climb Jacob's ladder to the streets of
gold.</p>

<p>Martha and I went through an evil fall day together. I had
obeyed all her dicta, but a sense of the ominous still hung over
us. The morning was gray, with a treacherous promise of the
healing storm that never came. A false light came instead, and
faded, and the sky was metallic. I found a praying mantis on the
asparagus fern in front of the veranda and put it in a glass jar
with a few sprays of the fern. It was angry and restless. It
folded and unfolded its green praying hands, and opened and
closed its mandibles, more in curse than in prayer. I called
Martha to look at it, wondering if she had some special name for
it, and some age-old story. But she had never seen the insect
before, and recoiled from its spurious reverence. I stood at the
foot of the veranda steps as we talked. When I turned away to
come in the house again, I looked down and saw a cotton-mouth
moccasin lying not two inches from my heel prints in the sand. My
negligee must have brushed its coils. I hurried for my gun and
shot him. The head struck at me after the shot, and he died with
hate in his viper's eyes.</p>

<p>All morning a blue-tailed lizard ran in and out of a crack
along the veranda. He switched his tail, sleek and shining and
lacquered. A cockroach came out in the daylight, of a breed that
usually stirs only by night. The two bird dogs, ordinarily bent
on some mischief together, slept all day. Once or twice they
lifted their noses, were not pleased with something, and went
back to sleep again. I grew feverish in the afternoon and slept a
drugged sleep. I awakened and tried to work and could not. I
read, but the words had no meaning. At five in the afternoon Snow
came to milk the cows and feed the calves and ducks and chickens.
He hung the cottonmouth in the crotch of a tree. I fed the dogs.
They ate silently and curled up again. Snow went away. I bathed
and dressed.</p>

<p>Martha came to the house to tell me that Sissie had come from
her cabin by the Creek to say that a suspicious Negro had just
come and gone. He had demanded water at Sissie's in a belligerent
tone, had walked boldly about the cabin as though estimating the
belongings, had said that he would go back across the Creek
bridge, and had, instead, doubled back on his tracks and slipped
east along the Creek, back of my grove. I remembered that I had
read in the paper of a Negro murderer who had escaped and had
last been seen coming our way. I drove to the village to report
the matter to the deputy sheriff there. He promised to bring men
to the Creek for the search. I came home, and was restless and
uneasy, and set out to walk along the road. I called the dogs to
go with me, and usually exuberant, they let me go alone. The sun
must have set, for that is its unbroken habit, but there was only
a stain like old blood to make the sunset.</p>

<p>My feet dragged and it took me a long time to cover the return
distance to the grove. Lightning flashed but there was no
thunder. Dark overtook me before I reached home, seeming to close
in like an enemy. There was light enough to determine that the
tail of a snake extending into the road was that of a rattler. I
hurried by and a screech owl shrilled its wavering lament in the
hammock. I opened my gate and a small snake moved ahead of me. I
bent close, and I could see that it was the deadly coral snake. I
avoided it and when I returned with a gun it was gone.</p>

<p>The deputy sheriff came to report that he and his men had
searched all the Creek area back of my grove, but because the
earth was so dry, had found no footprints past the wetness of the
Creek itself. If the criminal came out, he said, he would
certainly try to cut back into the main road. He and his men
would wait all night halfway between the Creek and the village to
trap him. He went away. I knew that a desperate man would attack
a house for food, for money, and above all, for a gun. I brought
all my guns to the veranda, loaded a rifle and a shotgun, and
waited. I did not dare turn on a light, for then I should be at
the mercy of an invader.</p>

<p>I sat in the darkness and heard Martha and Old Will pounding
away at the tenant house. They were barricading the doors and I
could not blame them. Home was usually a safe and cozy place, but
now it was menaced. I sat taut, listening for sly footsteps at
the back of the farmhouse. There was no sound but the crickets.
They chirped cheerily, hoping, as I, for change. Discouragement
took them over and the chirpings ceased. No car passed, no horse
and rider, no lowing cow, no dog, no friendly frog hunter on his
way to the Creek. The stillness was almost unbearable. At last I
lit a candle. It burned steadily for a while, then wavered. There
was a rustling in the distance, as though invisible wings passed
over marsh and grove and hammock. The palm trees rustled their
fronds in the darkness. There came the cleanness, the relief, the
beneficence, of wind. It was near midnight, and I knew that if
the criminal had not now approached the house to take what he
needed, he would not come. I went to bed and slept soundly, and
the murmur of boughs stirring softened my sleep. In the morning
we heard that the fugitive had been seen walking in the other
direction. And on the heels of the wind came the storm. The
season had broken, summer was ended, and the healthy fall had
come.</p>

<p>Martha remembers a time long ago when the only warning of
hurricanes, other than natural portents plain to the wise, was
the whistle of the train four miles away at the village. In the
hurricane season the engineer gave an agreed signal in
announcement, and in winter another to tell of an impending
freeze. When the wind is right we can hear the passing of the
train itself, and the warning whistle must have come mournfully
and distinctly to the Creek. Hurricanes are not a serious menace
in the interior, but we get the fringes of the big coastal
storms. An ominous green light precedes them, and a great
stillness that may hold for twenty-four hours. The green deepens,
is infiltrated with a cosmic black ink, and the sky-writing has
its meaning plain. Then in the distance we hear a roaring, as
though the express passing through the village had left its
tracks and were headed for the Creek.</p>

<p>The sound, once heard, can never be forgotten and is always
recognizable for what it is. It means that the wind is rushing in
with such force and such volume, filling the atmospheric vacuum,
that the obstacles of trees tear and shred it in its coming. The
roar becomes a booming and the path of the wind is visible far
ahead. I have sat on the veranda with the moss on the pecan tree
that shades it hanging motionless, and across the grove seen the
palm trees flatten halfway to the ground. They toss their heads
like tethered lions, fighting to be free of the thing that rips
at their bodies and loosens their feet from the safe earth. The
fronds are stripped like paper from the trunks, and sail through
the air, stabbing into the ground, stem ends down. Live oaks and
tall pines crash in the hammock. The wind strikes the farmhouse a
physical blow. If any of the old hand-hewn cypress shingles are
loose in the lichened roof, this is when they go. The house
sighs, but does not rock nor rattle. It has stood through too
many storms to be disturbed by this one. Sometimes the wind comes
alone, and goes on its way, and leaves a still lower barometer
behind it. When it returns again it will have even greater force,
and this time the rain will accompany it. The hurricane rains fly
always at an acute angle, borne outward by the fierce pressure.
They give the appearance of a swinging curtain. Cows and pigs
caught up in it are swept along in a panic and must go in the
storm's chosen direction. Twice I have been overtaken in the
field and it seemed to me that I should never beat my way out of
the tidal wave. The great storms may last for three days and
these days and nights howl like all the mad dogs in the world
loose at once. There is not the coziness of being shut in away
from ordinary storms. Too gigantic a force is at large for any
sense of safety.</p>

<p>When the September storms are over we have some of our most
superb weather. The oranges take on color, the red-birds are
delirious, and in the morning and evening long shadows lie under
the citrus trees. The skies are the brightest of robin's-egg blue
and the air has a translucent quality, as though the storms had
washed it with a fine gold dust. The bear grass blooms and we
shall use the harsh strips of the leaves for hanging our fall
hams and bacons in the smoke-house. The deer tongue, or wild
vanilla, blooms in the flat-woods, and when we step on the
leaves, crushing them, the scent is spilled perfume on the
air.</p>

<p>If they are not planted already, we hurry to put in our fall
crops: beans, English peas, squash and cucumbers; our winter
crops of cabbage, lettuce, carrots, beets, broccoli, turnips,
collards, kohlrabi, cauliflower and celery. The hurry now for the
fall market crops is against the first frost. The beans are
delicate and must make before the cold has touched them. The
crops that have matured through the long summer are ready. Sweet
potatoes are dug and mounded for the winter's use, the vines fed
to the cows and the nubbins to the hogs. The fields of sugar cane
are gold-green, Chinese scarves waving across the tawny sand. It
is desirable for a light frost to touch the cane to sweeten it,
as persimmons and citrus must be touched, but a heavy frost ruins
it, so that the stalks sour where they stand.</p>

<p>The cane is scythed down, the bundles gathered like sheaves of
wheat, and drawn with mule and wagon to the grinding. I think the
cane mill will survive all mechanization on our remote Florida
farms and backwoods clearings, certainly as long as there is any
individualistic and agrarian society. Each family has a small
plot of sugar cane for its own use and several families use one
mill. A mule or horse walks around and around. A boy feeds the
cane stalks into the gears of the mill, and the cloudy sweet
juice bursts through a spout and into a barrel. We have
cane-grindings and syrup-boilings, festive occasions when the
children may run and shriek as they please and the old folks come
and renew their childhoods. There are experts among the syrup
boilers, and when these give a boiling, their followers flock to
them. And when the new cane syrup goes in bottles or tins to the
rural grocery stores roundabout, the proprietors announce to
their customers that they can now offer Martin's syrup. There is
a finer flavor to syrup that you have seen boiling and bubbling
in the great kettle, with the fatwood fire blazing under it, the
sweet smell of it cooking, the bees that come even at night to
guzzle at the edges, the skimmed heavy syrup seen poured into a
clean hewn cypress trough.</p>

<p>We have peanut boilings in the fall earlier than syrup
boilings, for the peanuts are good for boiling only before they
are mature. They are well washed and boiled in the hull in salted
water. The nuts are gelatinous, with all the peanut sweetness,
and quarts may be eaten without a trace of stomach ache. In
Georgia they call peanuts "goobers" and in Florida we call them
"pinders." Pinder-ripening time is the height of harvest, and the
hogs are turned in to the fields to root up the vines and grow
fat and marketable in a week or two on the rich oily kernels. The
doves and quail flock to the fields, for the greedy hogs chew the
peanuts carelessly, and walk from row to row with broken
fragments dropping from their snouts, precisely the right size
for the bills of birds.</p>

<p>One fall, one of my first at the Creek, I had two fine porkers
I had bought for fifty cents each in the wilds near the Ocklawaha
River. I heard that old man Butler, at Orange Lake Station, had
fifteen acres of pinders and wanted to fatten hogs on shares. My
shoats had outgrown the table scraps. I loaded them in the truck
and drove off to Butler's in the September twilight. The old man
came to the gate with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Now I'm powerful glad to have visitors," he said. "Come right
in, friend."</p>

<p>I had not come to visit, I said, but on the business of
fattening hams.</p>

<p>"Now, friend, you must be a stranger. How come you're in such
a hurry? Ham can wait. Pork always do be sweeter for a mite of
time. You like boiled pinders?"</p>

<p>I confessed to a passion for them.</p>

<p>"Then we'll go pull you some pinders to carry home to boil,
and I want you to come back for another visit and tell me they
was the best you ever sucked outen the hull. What's your name?
Never mind, I'll just call you Friend. Come on now. The moon is
high and we can see as good as day."</p>

<p>He was excited, intoxicated with something I could not place.
An elderly female figure emerged like a shadow from the
cedar-bordered path.</p>

<p>"You come to buy the farm?" she quavered. "You know anybody
wants to buy a farm?"</p>

<p>"The farm ain't for sale," old Butler said placidly. "Now
sugar-plum, me and my friend here aim to pull pinders. Go fetch
us a basin and come with us yonder to the field."</p>

<p>She followed obediently and sadly with an ample pan. The
moonlight flooded the peanut field. Hogs came behind us and
rooted in our wake, snuffling and grunting.</p>

<p>"Ain't this a fine farm?" Friend Butler demanded. "I was born
on this place."</p>

<p>The woman stripped peanuts from the vines mechanically.</p>

<p>"He just says that," she murmured mournfully. "It was some
place in the county, but the record's lost and he don't really
know."</p>

<p>I understood that there was war between these gentle veterans.
It was the age-old conflict between love of the soil and hate of
it.</p>

<p>"Ain't this peaceful, friend?" Butler asked. "Ain't it
beautiful? I lived in a blasted town for twenty years, and now
I'm back again, right on the place where I was born."</p>

<p>The woman did not address him or me directly, but spoke in the
manner of a Greek chorus, chanting dismally.</p>

<p>"He acts drunk all the time," she lamented to the moon. "Just
runs around plumb crazy, raising hogs and pinders and sweet
potatoes. Nobody to talk to, no place to go. No lights at night
to look at, nothing but the tormented moon and stars. I got ten
kittens, but they ain't real company. Run around near about as
bad as him. He talked me into trading good city lots for this. If
we could only sell and go back to town. But nobody in their right
mind would buy it."</p>

<p>Friend Butler waved his arms, dripping earth and peanuts from
the vines he held. He ignored the chorus, as befits a hero of
Greek drama.</p>

<p>"Now this is what I enjoy! Pullin' pinders in the moonlight,
with a friend to enjoy them with me."</p>

<p>He gave a vast sweep and the peanuts flew wide.</p>

<p>"Independent! That's it, independent!"</p>

<p>He must show me his four acres of orange trees, old time-worn
fellows as big as oaks. The moonlight filtered through the arched
rows. Friend Butler became speechless with ecstasy. He must give
me a drink of icy water from an ancient well with buckets and
windlass, and I must understand how sweet and rare it was. My
porkers must be ushered gravely into the Elysium of pinders, my
basinful of peanuts loaded in the truck. The unhappy quaverings
of the woman trailed after me as I drove away. I promised to stay
longer when I came next month for the fattened pigs.</p>

<p>I never saw my friend again, sending for my pigs when they
were ready. Last month I read in the local paper of his death. I
was immensely gratified to read that his address was still Orange
Lake Station.</p>

<h2><a name="c21">21. <i>Winter</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We have one fixed seasonal dividing line. While spring and
summer and fall merge silently one into the other, we announce
winter with the crackling of gun shot. On November 20 our hunting
season opens. The day comes close to being a state holiday. Men
who hunt at no other time go out "the first day of season." Even
Little Will begs off from his morning's work and goes to the
hammock for squirrels or to the Creek edge for ducks or coots. We
are excited and hilarious, and I think that a part of this is
because we are unconsciously returning to the pioneer aspect of
the state, when all men took a portion of their living from the
hunt. It is the marked end of one thing, too, and the beginning
of another, and something in men's minds likes a simple
demarcation. Our crops are harvested or reaching their maturity.
Ahead of us is the good season, when growth is slowed and a very
little hoeing keeps clean the farm fields, the groves and the
gardens. It is the tidy time. The lush exuberance of summer is
forgotten and the hurricanes of the fall. All is neat and
ordered.</p>

<p>My own flower and vegetable gardens are thriving, if they will
thrive at all, and my citrus crop will not be ready for picking
before Christmas. I do most of my writing in the summer, when
there are no interruptions, and I have hurried to finish such
work. I have a space of freedom and I am ready to go into the
woods and the fields with my friends. Fred Tompkins and I open
the hunting season together. He has long been my favorite hunting
and fishing companion. He brings to the sport a great gaiety of
spirit and an eye for all the beauty of the open. The hunt with
him is a comfortable affair and I love him for his frequent stops
to sit on a pine log and smoke a cigarette.</p>

<p>"No use to kill ourselves havin' a good time," he says.</p>

<p>My only grievance against Fred is that he has never been
entirely convinced that I am not a Yankee. I should not hold this
against him, for he judges Yankees, after more than fifty years
at it, as he would judge any one else. If they are good sports,
like to fish and hunt, and are always ready for a laugh, they
will do for friends. The first time he came to see me in my first
February here, he brought me a strange bouquet. It was of holly
berries and orange blossoms.</p>

<p>He said, "I studied what would please a Yankee lady, and I
figured it'd be new to her to have winter and summer all in one
bouquet."</p>

<p>I murmured, in the same breath with my thanks, words to the
effect that I did not consider myself a Yankee. He accepted the
thanks and passed lightly over my protests. I had arrived from
New York state, and I should have hard work of it proving any
contradictory antecedents. He tried me grievously in our early
friendship. It was late in my first spring at the Creek. An
affluent New York car drew up at my gate. A middle-aged man and
woman came to my door and greeted me warmly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tompkins sent us to you," they said. "He said just to
tell you that Fred sent us."</p>

<p>They were friends of Fred and that was good enough. I invited
them into the living room and we sat, attempting conversation. I
wondered why Fred had sent them and I offered a highball. They
refused stiffly.</p>

<p>The woman said, "You have very good fishing on Orange Lake,
Mr. Tompkins tells us."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Orange Lake is famous for its big-mouthed bass."</p>

<p>"We are fishing fanatics. We have fished all over Florida. You
fish, Mr. Tompkins says."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I'm not much good yet at casting, and I have no
outboard motor, but I go when any one will take me."</p>

<p>Brightly, "We have our outboard motor with us."</p>

<p>"How convenient!" I said.</p>

<p>Conversation languished. The woman looked at her husband and
he looked at her. At last she took the plunge.</p>

<p>"We're very anxious to fish in this part of Florida. Mr.
Tompkins said he was sure you would take us in."</p>

<p>"Take you in?"</p>

<p>"Yes. So that we can fish on Orange Lake. We'll be glad to pay
anything within reason."</p>

<p>"There must be some mistake. I don't run a boarding house. I
don't take people in."</p>

<p>The woman said desperately, "Mr. Tompkins said for us to offer
pay, but he was sure you would refuse it." She looked
despairingly at her husband. "He said that if you took a notion
to us, he was sure you would invite us to spend the month with
you."</p>

<p>I wondered if friendship in Florida meant that one offered
hospitality for a month to friends of a friend. It seemed too
much, even for the vaunted Southern hospitality. But if I was
cold now, and I was becoming colder every moment, these good
people, friends of my friend, would think that I had not taken a
notion to them. I fumbled for an excuse.</p>

<p>I said, "Ordinarily, of course, I should love to have you. But
we have a large crop of beans and are picking now and have extra
helpers and I have no room in the house, none at all. I'm so
sorry. Please tell our mutual friend Fred that I'm very
sorry."</p>

<p>"Oh, we won't see Mr. Tompkins again. We've never seen him
before. We just met him at the garage in Citra. We asked about
fishing and the garage man called Mr. Tompkins over and said he
could tell us more than any one else. Mr. Tompkins told us about
Orange Lake, and said he knew you would invite us to stay for the
month--if you liked us."</p>

<p>"I do like you, of course. I can see you're charming people.
But you understand about the lack of room. I guess Fred didn't
know about my not having any room."</p>

<p>They left, puzzled and reluctant. The first time I saw Fred I
questioned him.</p>

<p>"Why on earth did you send those perfect strangers out to me?
Why did you tell them I would take them in?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "they come through, Yankees and strangers. I
studied, how would I feel if I was living up in New York and
folks from Florida come through? I'd be so proud to have home
folks, I'd put 'em up for as long as they'd stay. So I figured,
you being a Yankee, and them being Yankees, it'd be a big treat
for you to have 'em visit you."</p>

<p>I said, "I came to Florida just to get away from Yankees."</p>

<p>Fred laughed heartily over my facetiousness and is entirely
convinced that I just did not take a notion to the strangers.
Fred is an amazing person. I do not know his age, but he was a
sergeant in the regular army in the Spanish war, so he is no lad.
Something about him is timeless, and when he was young he must
have looked much as he does now and will always look. His wife
says that he was handsome in his youth.</p>

<p>"He had them sparklin' brown eyes," she said to me, "and he
had a gold tooth, and he come to court me drivin' two black
horses drove tandem. I hadn't never see a gold tooth nor horses
drove tandem, and my heart turned to water in me."</p>

<p>Her heart is still water within her, but her devotion does not
prevent her from quarrelling steadily and hopelessly with him
over his habits. Because of her motherly and uneasy fluttering,
he calls her the Old Hen. My sympathies are of course with her,
for I know that the most ingratiating friend can be the most
exasperating husband.</p>

<p>"He's just different," I say to her. "You're a domestic fowl
and he's a wild fowl. You want him to stay home and he just
doesn't want to stay home."</p>

<p>"I know," she says, "but honey, wouldn't you think he'd want
to stay home nights once in a while? All he wants to do is prowl
and ramble. Just like a varmint. He's worst moonlight nights.
There's no keepin' him home after the moon comes up."</p>

<p>The Old Hen favors me with her friendship, and I think this is
because, whenever Fred and I hunt together, I try to bring her
home a fox-squirrel.</p>

<p>"The Old Hen's a slave to fox-squirrel," Fred says.</p>

<p>Our first-day-of-season hunt is a glorified combination
light-hearted search after deer, squirrel and quail. We set out
for the big scrub about four o'clock in the morning. Sometimes I
oversleep and we are a little late, leaving at five.</p>

<p>Fred says comfortably, "Maybe day'll hold off 'til we get
there."</p>

<p>We have always beaten the sunrise to the river. We cross the
hand ferry at Orange Springs in the grayness and the Ocklawaha
River boils darkly under us. We turn south on the narrow scrub
sand road and then west to the river bank at Ingram's field.
Fred's Ford goes unerringly through shoulder-high grasses, bumps
over gopher holes and comes like a homing pigeon to a cluster of
hickory trees at the edge of the rushing water. We leave the car,
leave the bird dog comfortably asleep in it, and go on foot along
the river trail in the darkness. The theory is that we will come
on a deer, and that day will break at that moment, so that our
shots will coincide with the technical instant of sunrise, at
which hunting legally begins. We have crowded day every time, and
only the fact that we have never seen a deer on these occasions
has kept us out of the hands of the law.</p>

<p>We know the river trail by heart, but each time it is as
though we moved silently into the dark core of a dream. There is
no sound but the rushing of the swift river current. Sometimes a
buck rabbit thumps or whistles, or a hoot owl cries through the
forest. It is an hour at which the small night creatures seem to
have finished their night's feeding and the day creatures have
not yet come from their sleep. Bamboo vines brush us as we go. We
can only distinguish one tree from another by the feel of the
bark as our hands touch it in passing. There is no greater
darkness than this high wood by night. The river bank steepens
and we turn up it, away from the river. The black curtain through
which we have been pushing thins to the gray velvet of dawn. The
trees at the top of the slope are spaced more widely. A dusty
pink glow seeps into the tops of the tall oaks and hickories and
magnolias. I learned here that what I had considered the fiction
of Cabell's mystic hour between daylight and sunrise is a magical
fact.</p>

<p>In this hour we abandon our deer hunting and find soft places
on the bank to sit and wait for squirrels. I have no compunction
here about killing them, for our breakfast depends on it. They
make themselves known a long way off. Where the river bank levels
off at the top into the broad stretch of thick low-growing scrub,
there is a swaying of scrub oak boughs, as though a sudden breeze
swept through them. There is a rustling, a scurrying, and as
though the rising sun released minute squeaking springs, a shrill
and rusty chattering. The squirrels are coming in to feed. The
gray bodies whisk up and down the hickory trunks. I hear Fred's
gun from his distant stand, and there is a great commotion for an
instant, until the squirrels decide the menace is remote. We
shoot no more than we shall need, and according to whether other
hunters are to join us for breakfast. The signal to meet comes
from Fred, who has gauged the number of our shots, and knows when
we have enough meat. He gives the bob-white call, and since I
cannot whistle in return, I work my way back toward his
calls.</p>

<p>We put our bag together and move back along the trail. The
scrub is a mass of green and gold, the jorees are calling in the
underbrush, and the swift river runs copper under the early sun.
At times, if the morning has been cold or windy, we have only a
squirrel or two, but cut into small pieces and simmered in the
Dutch oven they seem to multiply like the loaves and fishes and
there is always enough. We are famished, and the smother-fried
browned squirrel, the rich gravy made with river water, the bread
and camp coffee, are all we want of a feast under the shining
hickories. We eat leisurely and let the bird dog out to run and
we talk of where we shall hunt quail the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The dew is still heavy on the grasses and the quail have not
fed far from their night's bed. The scent is strong. The pines
cast long shadows and the air is sweet and cool. Some of my
hunting companions, such as the Major, seek out the most
inaccessible hunting grounds, but Fred and I avoid the swamps,
the bay-heads and too heavy a growth of palmettos.</p>

<p>"No use to kill us nor the dog neither," Fred says.</p>

<p>We hunt from the car, which the Major considered effete. The
custom antedates automobiles, going back to the days of the
hunting wagon. Then men piled their dogs, their camping supplies
and themselves into an open buckboard and set forth for the day
or the weekend or the week, independent and free. Hunting dogs
love to ride, especially in the company of humans. They hang over
the side of truck or wagon, or from the window of a car, their
long ears flapping in the breeze, their noses keen and lifted for
the great unrolling ribbon of smell.</p>

<p>Hunting from a car is no vicarious business. It means only
that great distances can be covered, moving from one good
territory to another without wasting hours in unlikely places.
Once in bird territory, Fred puts my Pat out. The dog works both
sides of the road, seldom ranging out of sight. A whistle and a
wave of the hand turn him in the desired direction. Fred drives
slowly, often in second gear, and when Pat's tail begins to
vibrate with a new tenseness, we leave the car and follow
wherever the scent may lead, for the dog is definitely on birds.
The point is a beautiful thing. Pat stands staunch and true, a
sturdy pattern in black and white, his nose on a line with his
back, one forepaw lifted daintily, his tail rigid, curving upward
a little at the end.</p>

<p>Fred takes Pat in the car at frequent intervals so that the
dog is always fresh. He gives him water from a shell box or finds
a clear pool in a sinkhole for him. We take with us a Dutch oven,
cooking fat, flour, bread and coffee. When the sun is high
overhead and the quail are nooning and dusting themselves in the
warm sand, we build a fire with fatwood chips and oak twigs,
dress what birds we have shot and fry them whole in deep sizzling
fat. We make strong coffee and stretch out our feet to rest them
while the birds brown and the coffee boils. We eat the birds in
our fingers and dip our slices of bread in the brown gravy in the
Dutch oven. Pat gets the bones and what is left over of bread and
gravy.</p>

<p>"Some folks say a dog can't smell good with gravy on his
nose," Fred says, "but a dog ain't goin' to leave no gravy on his
nose." He wipes the Dutch oven clean with the last slice of bread
and holds it for Pat. "I have a good time on a bird hunt and I
aim to have the dog have just as good a time as I do."</p>

<p>Game birds have an added flavor when you have shot them
yourself, or have at least been on the shoot. I am a poor shot,
and hypocritically have little true desire to do better. What
makes the sport is the magnificent country and the stirring
performance of good dogs. Good companions lift it into high
adventure, and while there are solitary souls who rove the fields
alone with dog and gun, it is one of the pastimes that I, who can
do with much solitude and like to walk alone, prefer to share.
But the birds I have downed would not make a respectable covey.
Some day I shall lay down my arms entirely.</p>

<p>I had a worse struggle over the kill with my Aunt Wilmer than
with my own conscience. Our line descends from Wesleyan Methodist
preachers and the flame burns fiercely, if fitfully, in Wilmer.
Fred and I took her with us on a quail hunt one winter when she
visited me, I dubiously, Fred full of mischief. At his most
conservative he drives with an utter disregard of the terrain.
Now, with a wide-eyed school teacher to terrify if possible, he
plowed with his Ford straight across the piney woods. We hit
gopher holes at forty-five miles an hour. The bird dog braced
himself stiff-legged on the back seat. We rushed at pine saplings
much larger than Fred usually attacked, sometimes hanging in
mid-air as the sapling resisted, then dropping over it like a
roller-coaster. When we left the car and the dog began to find
birds, I blundered along with my shooting as usual but Fred was
on his mettle. Every time he swung his gun to his shoulder, a
brown ball of feathers dropped to earth. Each time Wilmer ran
forward with a little wounded cry and retrieved the bird,
nestling it to her.</p>

<p>Fred said, "Now if you can keep your auntie here, we got no
use for a bird dog."</p>

<p>The dog was puzzled and a trifle resentful at having the
retrieving taken out of his control. He began going like an arrow
to the dead bird to get there ahead of Wilmer.</p>

<p>"The darlings," she murmured, stroking the bird feathers. "How
awful! This is awful!"</p>

<p>Left to myself, I, too, often feel that it is an unwarranted
slaughter, but Wilmer's moans made me perversely take the
opposite stand.</p>

<p>"It's really not so frightful to shoot them," I told her, "for
if a covey isn't shot into and broken up, it stays together and
the quail don't mate that year."</p>

<p>"That just proves," she said, "they're fine, moral birds."</p>

<p>I cannot testify as to their morality but I do know they have
a diabolical cleverness in outwitting the hunter. Any man who
comes home with enough quail for the table has earned his meal.
Four miles beyond the Creek there is a mystery covey on Guthrie's
land that always outwitted even the Major. There is good quail
shooting there, for we were the only hunters allowed on the land.
Each fall I swap pecans and oranges for the privilege of hunting
there. In consequence of not being much hunted, the quail are as
wild as hawks. Birds much hunted will hold for a dog's point.
Birds not hunted flush wild far ahead of the dogs. The Guthrie
terrain is ideal. Open black jack woods full of partridge peas
and sumac and myrtle berries join the cultivated fields of corn
and peanuts and chufas. The fields are bordered with blackberry
thickets where the quail love to "bunch up" for the night. The
woods dip to bay-head swamps where the birds are found in dry
weather or in the heat of the day. The shooting in the bay-heads
is difficult, but it was to the taste of the Major and his own
powerful dog Steve.</p>

<p>We usually had good luck until we fell foul of the mystery
covey. It fed from the road back to the bay-head and numbered at
least forty birds. After its first mad flushing and our first
desperate shots, at too great a distance, it disappeared into
thin air. The Major and I came on that covey again and again,
knowing about where we should find it at any given time of the
day. We never found it that day again. If it flew into the trees,
we were unable ever to see the small brown forms that cluster on
limbs like pine cones. If it flew farther, it was a greater
distance than any covey has been known to fly, for we made wide
arcs and circles with the indefatigable Steve and found no trace
of it. I spoke of it to old-timers who travel the River Styx road
past the Guthrie place. The enormous covey has been known to them
for years. Their theory is that one wise old cock has led it all
this time, a cock with some special technique for outwitting the
hunter.</p>

<p>The Major opened up for me the &aelig;sthetic delights of
duck-hunting. The sport pleased me particularly because, in the
great beauty of the surroundings, there was not a chance that I
should ever bring down one of the swift-flying birds. We met on
the north side of Orange Lake before dawn and crossed in a small
boat to an established duck blind. The lake was gray chiffon, the
horizon a gray velvet curtain. Sometimes, on rainy mornings,
there was no lifting of the soft mist. Only, in the distance, the
palms took shape, the reeds and saw-grass stood out like the
lines of an etching, and the water was a silver mirror for the
ducks and coots, flying low. On days when the sun rose visibly,
the gray was slowly infiltrated with lavender, then with pink,
until the sun lifted before us and sky and water blazed with
salmon and orange and red, and all the world of lake and shore
came to life. The red-winged blackbirds chattered from the
tussocks, the coots took off from the water like clumsy
seaplanes, the big-mouthed bass leaped and made great whirls and
spirals, the ducks gave their harsh vibrant call, white herons
winged over, and a fish-eagle screamed, high against the sky.
Then we settled quietly in the blind, each listening for the
other's "Mark!"</p>

<p>I loved the swift whir of the approaching ducks, the sharp
slicing of the air overhead. I lifted my hypocritical gun
obediently and fired, usually to hear, "Diana, damn it, the birds
almost took your hat off." It was good to be ravenous in early
midday, to open the lunch basket and eat the whole length of a
Cuban sandwich--eight inches long, four inches thick, stuffed
with layers of chicken and ham and roast pork and cheese and
chopped sweet pickle--and to digest such a preposterous affair as
easily as though it were baby food. A flight of ducks, of course,
always came over when one's mouth was full and one's hand was on
the beer bottle or the coffee cup instead of the shotgun. That
gave me a fine excuse and no alibi was necessary. Then the sun
was low and the egrets came in to roost and the ducks were arrows
against the sky. Home was good then, with supper of red wine and
biscuits and quail from yesterday's hunt, or a roast guinea, and
afterward, good talk by the blazing hearth-fire. These are the
things my mind holds dear of hunting.</p>

<p>Of my deer hunting I treasure, not a kill, but a hunt deep in
the Everglades, when Bob Chancey and I followed two great bucks
from dawn to dark, and never once saw the quarry. They were ghost
deer, with incredible large tracks running side by side, and they
led us through a dream world of gray cypresses and silent Spanish
moss and soft knee-deep watery sloughs. The trail once crossed a
circular pond and growing on all the cypresses around the pond
were orchids, and I stopped and let my companion and his dog go
far ahead of me while I stood and stared and could not believe
that I held orchids in my hands. In the evening I took up a lone
stand deep under a thicket of low growing young cypresses massed
with strange exotic flowering vines. Beside the thicket was a
clear pool and to this in the rosy sunset hundreds of egrets and
great white herons came to drink and roost in the trees around
it. They did not see nor hear me and I forgot that the great
phantom bucks might pass my way, and sat and drank my fill of
white birds and ferns and flowers and crystal pool.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once upon a time there was snow at Cross Creek. The Chamber of
Commerce would insist that this was not a factual item, but the
beginning of a fairy tale. Yet oddly, the conditions and the
temperature necessary to make snow, are much milder than those
prevailing when we have our occasional disastrous and quite
snowless freezes. The snow at the Creek came on a cloudy winter
evening when the temperature hung at the minutest fraction below
thirty-two degrees. It was a fine, dry, powdery snow, like a
wandering breath of the north. In its brief falling it sifted
through cracks and eaves and lay for a moment like spilled salt.
It was surprising that so nebulous a thing should make an
entrance anywhere.</p>

<p>"Snow's a searchin' thing," Martha said. "Snow be's like
sorrow. It searches people out."</p>

<p>Our periods of cold last for three days at the most, then
mildness follows, and even during the bad times the days
themselves are bright and sunny. My only concern through the
winter is for my young grove. The old section of the grove has
taken care of itself since before 1890 and can be trusted to
survive if grove anywhere survives. When I came to the Creek, a
pecan grove stood across the road from the farmhouse. It was lush
and handsome in the summer. It was not profitable, many of the
trees being seedlings, many bearing no crop at all. In winter,
being deciduous, it was a nightmare; row on row of gaunt gray
skeletons. It irked me in a tropical climate to stare day after
day at bony, leafless trees, as though there were no escape in
all the world from bleakness.</p>

<p>I cut down all but a few of the better trees and used them for
fire wood. After them stood a vacant field, fertile but unbred.
The lean times came to me, when my reserve money was gone and the
grove for two years had not paid its way. I did not know whether
the grove and I should be able to weather our difficulties. The
field across the road grew high in weeds and was sad for lack of
production. It depressed me to look out on those rich acres and
know that I was not able to feed them. When things looked the
most desperate, my Florida stories found a market. With my first
available money I planted the field to orange trees. I chose
Valencias, for they are our late orange, maturing in March and
April, and I longed to have the bright globes of fruit to look at
after the earlier citrus was harvested. But the field proved to
be what we call a cold-pocket, lying a little lower than I had
realized, and I have been obliged to nurse the young trees year
after year. The late maturity for which I chose the Valencias has
nearly been my undoing, for they must weather the most severe
cold, long after the other oranges have been safely picked.</p>

<p>I invariably put off all the orange picking as long as
possible. I have watched the fruit so long, from the first
blossoms in February, through the summer growth of the hard green
balls, through the sudden swelling on the fall rains, and, with
cool nights, the bright color showing. The oranges hang like
lighted lanterns through the winter. I use the excuse of waiting
for a better market, but I delay in fact only because I cannot
bear to see them cut and the globes of light extinguished.
Several times I have lost the entire crop in a freeze through my
dilatory fondness.</p>

<p>The picking is a colorful process. The Negro pickers arrive on
a truck like a cage of birds, huddled together in silence. They
hate the early morning cold and mist and cannot be sent up into
the trees until the sun is high enough to dry the dew. They build
fatwood fires near the barn and crouch close to them. Some have
brought their breakfast with them and some are already hungry for
their lunch. They open the paper sacks and the tin lard pails and
eat, and my chickens have learned to go to them for the crumbs.
They eye my dog suspiciously, for a lunch-stealing dog is a
catastrophe. They stretch their legs to the fire, and, warmed and
fed, the talk and laughter begin, as though a stream had emerged
from its winter coat of ice.</p>

<p>The foreman says, "All right, boys. Let's see who's the best
man with those ladders. Pick clean as you go. No stem ends. Pick
up all dropped fruit from the ground before you leave your tree.
Full boxes."</p>

<p>A flock of chattering monkeys is suddenly in the orange trees.
There are jests and jibes, the ladders rattle against the boughs,
and the sound of the metal orange clippers is like castanets. A
powerful young buck begins a song. He is derided and there are
calls for "Preacher." Preacher is a wizened little chimpanzee of
a Negro, his hands swift as the claws of a hawk among the
oranges. He is the best singer of them all. His notes roll out in
an old spiritual, low and rich and slowly spaced. One by one the
men join in. The orange clippers click in counterpoint against
the swell.</p>

<p>My trees are old and tall, and thirty-foot ladders must be
used to reach the tops. Only an experienced hand can manage one
alone. He runs to his tree with it, balancing it like a juggling
acrobat. The tall ladders rest precariously against the frail
topmost branches, but the pickers mount quickly and surely. They
are reminded of the need for climbing, the age-old set-backs, the
burden of their race and their hope. Sooner or later "Jacob's
Ladder" sounds mournfully from high in the tallest trees and a
great organ seems to roll its notes across the grove. It is the
favorite song of the orange pickers and they sing it with a sad
fervor.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jacob's ladder's steep an' ta-all--<br>
 <i>When Ah lay mah burden down!</i><br>
 If you boun' to climb,<br>
 You boun' to fa-all--<br>
 <i>When Ah lay mah burden down!</i><br>
 Burden down, burden down,<br>
 <i>When Ah lay mah burden down!</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Sometimes Preacher gives them a sermon, and they chant the
responses like a Mass. His strong old voice exhorts them from the
top of an orange tree and they cry out in answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord!"</p>

<p>"Preacher right!"</p>

<p>"Ain't it the truth!"</p>

<p>"Lord be praised!"</p>

<p>"Hallelujah!"</p>

<p>Sometimes they sing the songs of the jook-joints, the Saturday
night songs, but I have an idea that the day I hear "Shake that
thing" ribald from the orange trees, Preacher is not picking that
day. He can pick with the best of them, but his strength fails
him and he must take a day off now and then.</p>

<p>I acquired an undeserved reputation for ferocity among the
pickers. The market price on citrus one season was high, my fruit
was unpicked, and word of a freeze impending came in late on a
Saturday night. I sent six miles away to Citra early Sunday
morning, asking a picking crew to come at once, and offering
double the usual pay. The crew came back on my truck, still a
little tipsy from Saturday night. They set jovially to work. I
sat on the back porch oiling and cleaning my bird gun that had
had hard use all the week. Suddenly I became aware that a Sabbath
calm lay over the grove, but from the tenant house came sounds of
revelry. Black Kate was entertaining the pickers. I dashed toward
her quarters, shouting to make myself heard above the gay din. A
banjo tinkled, feet beat on the floor, and whoops of laughter lay
over Kate's lone female voice.</p>

<p>I called out for the crew to get out and pick oranges or to
get out altogether. The pickers did not emerge from the door one
by one and sheepishly, as I expected, but amazed me by popping
out of every window in the tenant house as though a cage of
blackbirds had been liberated. They galloped to their ladders and
several fearful souls made a dash for the woods. I looked down.
All unconsciously I was toting my gun and flourishing it as I
shouted. I had the report later that all records for picking were
broken that day. I find that I am still known to the pickers as
"the lady who jes' as soon shoot you as look at you."</p>

<p>Twenty boxes a day is a fair average for a picker, but the old
hands at it do much better, and in a picking contest this winter,
the champion picked more than forty boxes. Pickers are paid by
the box and can make much more than at the low hoeing wages.
There have been two seasons in which the pickers netted more per
box than I did. The orange season is the cash-money season for
most of us. The entire village works in season at the
orange-packing plant, washing, grading, wrapping and packing the
fruit. We pay up our accumulated summer bills and make down
payments on cars and radios and set aside money for spring seeds
and fertilizer.</p>

<p>Christmas is the height of the orange season. There will be
steady shipments for two months more, but in December the citrus
has come to full perfection and the oranges are burnished gold,
bursting with juice. Christmas is celebrated quietly at the
Creek. None of the holidays has the festival air of the north,
probably because here we are likely to take a holiday at any
moment the fancy strikes us, and live a more liberated life in
general. We have no need of the emotional outlet of specified
gala occasions. Thanksgiving is only a name. Banks and stores are
closed on the Fourth of July, but farm work is likely to go on as
usual. A very old black man came to his hoeing in my grove on one
Fourth. In late morning he shuffled to the door.</p>

<p>"Please, Missy, I notice de postman don't come this mornin'.
Could you tell me, please, be's this Thanksgivin'?"</p>

<p>I undertook to explain the significance of the Fourth of July.
In a moment the old Negro and I were beyond our depth. He had
heard of George Washington but believed him to be an
insignificant contemporary of Lincoln. He had never heard of
Europe nor England nor the Declaration of Independence. The
United States had no connection with Florida. The only wars he
had heard of were "the war jes' a while back" and "the Confed'rit
war." "Freedom" meant only one thing, the emancipation. He
himself had been born "the year after Freedom." I left him
feeling that the Fourth of July most certainly had something to
do with emancipation, and wondering vaguely if he should not go
home and sit respectfully on his stoop.</p>

<p>There is not much giving of Christmas gifts at the Creek. We
give presents to one another at any season according to what we
may have in abundance. At Christmas I make up boxes for the
Negroes, of frivolities along with needed sweaters and shirts and
dresses, candy, fruit cake and pecans, more for my pleasure than
theirs. They thank me for the unopened boxes, as a matter of
courtesy, and never, with equal politeness, refer to them again,
so that I never know whether I have truly pleased them or not. I
take boxes of candy and toys to any families of children, migrant
or permanent, at the Creek, and while again I never hear of them
afterward, I feel more certain of having given pleasure. I have
no gifts in return, but sometime during the year there will be a
present of wild grapes or blackberries, or a pair of quail, or an
especially large bass. One Christmas, Snow gave me a duck-hunt
for my present.</p>

<p>He said, "I studied and studied what I could give you that you
couldn't buy."</p>

<p>He repaired his outboard motor, borrowed small boats from his
frog-hunting friends, located the best duck flights on Orange
Lake, set up duck blinds, and on the chosen date, took out my
party. A millionaire could not have given a finer present.</p>

<p>Most Christmas days at the Creek have been warm enough to
serve Christmas dinner on the veranda. I feel a little cheated on
such occasions, for although half the world is warm at Christmas,
it is difficult not to think of snow and cold and reindeer and
coziness in connection with the day. I have a roaring fire on the
hearth no matter what the temperature, and growl a bit at the
bright sunshine and the hibiscus blossoms. The holly and the
mistletoe that are inseparable from the northern celebration grow
in abundance at the Creek, and the poorest families gather a few
sprays to hang over the mantel. The mistletoe is a parasite
(which the Spanish moss is not) and sucks the substance from my
pecan trees. It must be cut out once a year in any case and I
have no qualms at breaking immense boughs at Christmas time for
furbishing my house and for taking to town friends.</p>

<p>I can never snap off one of the brittle sprays without
thinking of Lum. Lum and Ida were my one attempt to have white
help on the place. There was resentment in the village at my
using Negro help. A good white man would have been more than
acceptable, but it was difficult to explain why I did not want a
white woman. It is impossible to make a servant of any southern
white, and I rejoice in the fact. But it is irksome enough for me
to do my writing on the veranda at the Creek, in the midst of the
commotion of grove and stock, with constant interruptions to give
advice about broken machinery and escaped cows. I have been
obliged to train myself to accept the disturbances as part of the
natural background. A white country woman would be much more of a
guest than a maid. My aloofness would never be understood if I
were reluctant to stop my writing to listen to her personal story
and to sit and visit with her when her own work was done. But I
was told in the village again and again that it was not fair to
the unemployed there to pay my comparatively high wages to
Negroes, when white men were hungry. They believed also that my
work was all idleness and ease. I tried to tell them that the
work was hard and steady, that there was little time for fishing
and for long siestas and days and weeks of the complete inertia
to which many of them were accustomed.</p>

<p>I think the village backed Lum for a show-down. He demanded
the job. He understood, he said, that I needed a woman in the
house as well as a man for the grove. He and Ida were the perfect
pair and they were coming, whether or no. I protested feebly that
Ida was not suitable for the making of a servant, the work too
hard--and I needed a servant.</p>

<p>"She waits on me for nothin'," Lum said. "Ain't a reason in
the world why she cain't wait on you for pay."</p>

<p>They descended on me against my protests. It worked out in
exactly opposite fashion from what I had expected. Ida was indeed
perfect. She was quiet and very sweet and learned as fast as I
could teach her. My habits of cooking were as strange to her as
though I had been Chinese, but if by gravy I meant a greaseless,
browned and floured affair, instead of a bowl of melted fat, that
was the gravy I should have. She was spick and span and I have
never lived more immaculately. And miracle of miracles, she had a
complete understanding, without my ever having to make mention of
it, that one engaged in what she called "composition" needed
peace and quiet for the job. In our few weeks together we became
deeply attached. We wept and embraced and vowed eternal
friendship when Lum tore us apart and took her away.</p>

<p>The job was an appalling blow to Lum. To keep up with the
routine winter work meant from eight to ten full hours a day. He
could not believe it.</p>

<p>"They ain't no time for a feller jest to set and rest and
think," he complained.</p>

<p>I said, "I tried to tell you that my job wasn't play."</p>

<p>The first real rift came over the mistletoe. Whatever man had
worked on the place before had brought me at Christmas acceptable
boughs without question. I told Lum that I was ready to decorate
the farmhouse for Christmas and wanted at least a dozen boughs of
mistletoe. He brought me a few small sprays totally without
berries.</p>

<p>I said, "These won't do. I want larger ones, and I want the
ones with berries. I know there are berries, because I can see
them."</p>

<p>"Sure there's berries. But they're high up in the trees."</p>

<p>"Then go higher and get them."</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, "I ain't no damn mockin' bird."</p>

<p>He was indeed no mocking bird. I think he fancied himself as a
bird of Paradise. I climbed into the pecan trees myself and broke
my mistletoe, thinking to shame the man, but he was unimpressed.
The final shock came to him when we fired the young grove on the
first freeze. The cold came shortly after Christmas. I rounded up
ten hands to help with the firing. Through the afternoon they
hauled fat pine from the high stack kept for the purpose, and
placed it in the grove, one fire to be laid in the center of each
square of four trees. Two four-foot logs of the rich resinous
pine are crossed in an X, a little kerosene poured on the center
for a quick start when the temperature drops to 28 degrees.</p>

<p>Night came and the temperature dropped steadily. The fatal 28
came at midnight and I gave the word for the lighting of the
fires. I put Lum in charge and Ida and I went at the business of
preparing food and drink to warm the men through the long bitter
night. The work is so cruel that it seems to me the least I can
do is take care of the men properly. We had pounds of hamburg,
baked beans, bread and butter, jams and relishes, sweet buns and
hot coffee, and the men came in relays of two through the night
to eat and warm themselves by the roaring wood range in the
kitchen. I had also several quarts of gin and whiskey, and I
suspect that this heating medium is the source of my success in
getting hands for firing. I turned over the liquor to Lum with
instructions to parcel it out through the night as the men needed
it. Authority and liquor went to Lum's head. He drank the lion's
share and toward morning, while the men shivered and went
without, Lum was overcome and returned to his bed to sleep in
drunken comfort. I was obliged to take over the direction of the
firing myself, while Ida fried hamburgers and held the fort in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>The cold was so severe, going down to 17 degrees, that we
depleted the wood pile. Through the next day, bright and sunny
but still icy cold, the helpers took turns at sleeping and
hauling more fat wood. We were in for another night of it. Lum
appeared groggily to milk the cows and feed the chickens, then
went back to bed. When the second night came and all the crew was
on hand for the work, Lum calmly announced that he would not be
with us. All of us save Lum had worked without sleep for
thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>"Hit's too much to ask of a feller," he said, "that's used to
his comfort."</p>

<p>I asked with what calm I could muster, "How can you expect to
keep a job where you won't do what has to be done in an
emergency?"</p>

<p>He answered with greater calm, which, unlike mine, was not
affected, "Oh, I ain't studyin' on keepin' it. I'm quittin'."</p>

<p>It would have been only a Pyrrhic victory for me to insist
that he was not quitting but was fired, so I let it pass.</p>

<p>I said, "Very well. But when you go back to the town, I want
you to tell everybody that comes to the post-office that the job
out here is a man's job."</p>

<p>"Don't you fret," he said amiably, "I'll tell 'em."</p>

<p>He must have painted a lurid picture of cold nights spent
without sleep and days spent gathering mistletoe at dizzy
heights. I have not since been asked for my work at the
Creek.</p>

<p>There is a healthy challenge in danger and a certain spiritual
sustenance comes from fighting it. For all the losses they have
cost me, I would not choose to have lived without knowing the
nights of firing on a freeze. Nowadays at the Creek we do not
have to depend on the wailing of the train whistle for a warning,
but have it over the radio. By two o'clock in the afternoon we
know for fact the approximate temperatures of the coming night.
Mature citrus fruit can stand 28 degrees for four hours, 26
degrees for two hours. The trees themselves, if in good
condition, can stand temperatures much lower. The grove itself
survived 15 degrees a few winters ago. Some affluent grove owners
use smudge pots of the California type, but most of us put our
faith in the old-fashioned fatwood fires. The smudge pots cost
about seven dollars each, even in large quantities, require from
one to two dollars' worth of crude oil a night, and rust to
pieces during the two and three year periods in which the cold is
not menacing. I am convinced as well that the smudge pots raise
the grove temperature by only two or three degrees, while our
pine blazes have raised them as much as six degrees. The smudge
pots lay a thick smoke, but good fat pine properly handled lays
enough of a protective blanket of smoke over the trees against
the settling cold.</p>

<p>If we have had warning enough, we place the wood in the
afternoon and are ready to touch the pine torches to it at the
crucial moment. The weather at such times is always as clear as a
bell. A damaging freeze is impossible under cloudy or windy
skies. The sun sets magnificently, fiery red, laying lingering
fingers across the shining orange trees as though reluctant to
withdraw its mercy. The air is so still that voices from far away
sound very close at hand, and the champing of the cows on their
hay in the lot is audible. It is too cold for the birds to sing
an evensong and they go to bed early and uneasily. The first
stars are visible while the west is still rosy. They are silver
against aquamarine. There is never at any moment complete
darkness. The stars take over the sun's work, but with a
dispassionate aloof coldness, like a frigid and beautiful
stepmother taking over a nursery where once walked warm and true
maternity. The earth itself stands like a child, awaiting the
injustice and the blow. We have bared our bosoms to the sun, and
trusted it, and it has gone and left us to the treachery of the
stars.</p>

<p>Yet, as there is mental depression on a low barometer, there
is an exhilaration on this high pressure that throws its icy
mantle around us. We hurry about in inadequate clothing and are
too engaged with fighting to feel the cold. We bring out
newspapers and old quilts and sheets and drape them over our
favorite shrubs. The poinsettias, as trusting as we, have reached
their full brilliant bloom by midwinter and stand with proud
heads to be struck down. There will be no saving them, even under
the sheets, if the night be bad. The avocados are too tall and
brittle to be weighted with covering. The hardy hybrid roses can
shift for themselves. The north is in their blood and their sap
exults secretly at the touch of cold. We shall have finer roses
than ever after the freeze. The plumbago can be saved and perhaps
the roots at least of the flame vine. The guavas will survive,
and the pomegranate, and the Amaryllis and spider lilies. I pull
Spanish moss from the pecan trees to cover the tender plants in
the garden. No matter what other help I may have, from wherever
she may be Martha comes to help me with this.</p>

<p>"I jes' so feered, Sugar," she says, "evvybody but me be so
busy they forget the garden."</p>

<p>We cap each plant with a mound of the soft moss. It will keep
safe and warm for as long as needed the delicate gerberas and
snapdragons and all the other flowers in bud or the first
blossoming. Martha likes to help too with the feeding of the
firing crew through the night.</p>

<p>"The mens tells me they looks forward to my coffee," she says.
"I makes it double strong and I doesn't stint 'em with the milk
and sugar. A night like this be's no time to be scarce with the
rations."</p>

<p>Sometimes we wait through most of the night for the
temperature to drop low enough to light the fires. Midnight may
tell the story. If the temperature has hovered around 32 until
that time, then suddenly begins to dip down, slowly but
inexorably, we are ready, and watch the thermometer as though the
life of a dying man were at stake. The poorest helper, recruited
from his clearing in the flatwoods, with not a single orange tree
of his own, knows that this is a matter of life and death for
something rich and fabulous and beautiful that he longs for as
his own, but will fight to save for a more fortunate other. If we
have 28 degrees just before daylight and it has not previously
dropped to this mark, we are inclined to risk it and to disband,
saving the precious fat pine for a worse night. Once I lost the
crop through this confidence in the passing by of the enemy. The
crew went home and I went to bed and between five and eight in
the morning the temperature dropped to 22 degrees and the fruit
was lost. If the fatal degree comes, it is usually about two
o'clock in the morning. Of late years Snow, like Martha, drops
whatever other work he may be doing, to supervise. He comes to me
with the word.</p>

<p>"Two o'clock and it's 28. Shall we turn the boys loose, or you
want to wait?"</p>

<p>"Turn them loose."</p>

<p>The pine splinter torches flicker in the night. The men have
been silent. Now they break into a chattering, like night birds
roused from the day's sleeping. Their voices are sharp across the
grove. The first fire blazes. There is rivalry to see who will
first light his assigned fires and have them burning and smoking
to cover his territory with the protective heat and smudge. There
has been a great tension, and now, with the grove a pattern of
blaze, it cracks. We are like soldiers, taut for the first
attack, and sighing deep with relief to have taken over the first
front with no casualties. It is important to have all the fires
going before the insidious cold has dropped again too
sharply.</p>

<p>I have seen no more beautiful thing in my life than my orange
grove by night, lighted by the fatwood fires. It is doubly
beautiful for the danger and the struggle, like a beloved friend
for whose life one battles, drinking in the well known features
that may be taken away forever. The fires make a geometric
pattern, spaced as regularly as the squares of trees. The pine
burns with a bright orange flame and the effect is of countless
bivouac fires across a low-wooded plain. The sky is sapphire
blue, spangled with stars. The smoke lifts from the fires
gray-white, melting into gray-blue, drifting like the veils of a
dancer under the open skies. Each orange tree is outlined with
light. The green leaves shine like jade. The round golden oranges
are each lit with a secret inner candle. My heart bursts with the
loveliness of the grove and of the night. If only, I think, I
could watch such beauty unencumbered by my fears. Then I know
that a part of the beauty is the fight to keep it, and that all
good things do not come too easily and must perpetually be fought
for. Our test is in our recognition of our love and our
willingness to do battle for it.</p>

<p>Sometimes the battle is hopeless. We burn all the pine, the
great pile accumulated through the summer and enough, I had
hoped, for four or five firings. One time it was all gone, and
the men and I exhausted, by five o'clock in the morning, and the
mercury was still falling. We could only stand and watch the
embers die down and the blue smoke fade to tattered wisps, see
day come in, gay and gaudy, and the temperature drop and drop,
until the sun that had failed us was high in the heavens, shining
over a tropical world solid with alien ice.</p>

<p>These mornings after a freeze are unbearably fine. The
red-birds take the sun at face value and sing as though they did
not know that the very corn in their guest basket were in danger
of never being replenished, for their host's sudden catastrophe
and poverty. The poinsettias flaunt their redness in the warmth,
unaware that they are frozen mausoleums of blossoms, and are
doomed within an hour to droop and shrivel on the stalks. The
orange leaves are rigid, for they too are frozen, and before the
day is done they will curl, then later turn yellow and wither and
fall untimely from the trees. Icicles drip from the water tower
and there will be no water in the pipes before midday. The
oranges themselves are balls of ice, and we make a game of eating
them while they are still sweet and frozen, and we offer one
another a dish of "orange sherbet." We are sick at heart. But we
are relaxed, too, and resigned. We have fought forces stronger
than we, and done our best, and lost, and now we may sleep.</p>

<p>There have been many winter battles at the Creek. Most of our
deaths come then, and our serious illnesses, as though the
lethargy of summer had kept us alive, but with the coming of the
enemy cold, we cannot resist any longer.</p>

<p>I remember the winter when Snow and I together saw old Joe to
his death. We live close to our animals at the Creek. When I was
poor, the death of a cow or mule, even of a brood-hen, came hard,
not only for the loss, but because we made our living together.
When my mule, old Joe, died in the lean days, I lost a
co-laborer.</p>

<p>He was an odd mule--not that all mules are not a little
peculiar. The unnatural mating of mare and donkey gives the
offspring a touch of the fey. Joe had a quizzical look in his
eyes, as though he were in on a joke. Mules in general live in a
sterile world of their own, apparently content to pull the plow
or harrow, to feed leisurely, and as emotional release to roll
gawkily on their backs, snorting at the good scratching of the
sand or the cooling touch of the pasture grass. Old Joe had fits
of loneliness and in his moods of sociability sought out any
company. A human being was preferred, but he had a weakness for
cows. I do not know how long it took him to attract the attention
of the Glisson milch cows that fed up and down the road, but he
made at last fast friends with a pair of young Jerseys. The
friendship was a false one, but like all illusions, was as
satisfying to Joe as a reality. The contact consisted of his
sticking his long nose over the fence of pen or pasture, and of
the two cows licking it in what he took for affection. He stood
with closed eyes and relaxed ears, drinking in the attention that
must last him so long a time. He could not know that the
delicious flavor of his salt brick was on his nose. His friends
were hypocrites.</p>

<p>When he fell ill, it seemed at first that his eccentricities
had for the moment got the better of him. We noticed that he
walked in circles. Perhaps his loneliness had touched his queer
mule's brain. Then as he paced the lot, he crashed into the side
of the barn. It was no ordinary blindness. It was a sightless
frenzy, born of pain. The neighbors came and stared and shook
their heads and went away. The blind staggers, they agreed. The
veterinarian identified the trouble as forage poisoning. It
seemed unfair that an old mule could not graze along the marsh
edge without meeting so strange an enemy. The poison is like the
rust on wheat or corn and grows sometimes on the marsh grass in
puffy black balls that give no warning to a creature. Its
substance is ergot, killer of human unborn. Purges may be tried
but there is seldom recovery.</p>

<p>Old Joe submitted to the drenching, his head tied high to an
orange bough. Then the circular walking continued, and the days
passed and the nights, and he would not eat nor drink, or could
not, and only walked around and around and around like something
charmed. We tethered him in the maiden cane until he wore the
rope through. He ran so wildly from us, crashing through the
orange grove when we pursued him, hurting himself so painfully,
that it seemed best to let him go his way. A second drenching had
only weakened him and there was nothing more to do, for witch
poisons are too much to cope with. The evening came when we knew
he would not know another, and somehow Snow and I wanted to keep
him company, knowing his spells of loneliness.</p>

<p>I remember the chilly loveliness of the night. The moon was
full in December and now and then the ripe pecans dropped sharply
in the stillness. We built a bonfire outside the fence to warm
us. Snow had not gone home for supper to his shack of the moment
and his friend Glenwood came to see about him. Glenwood squatted
beside us. It seemed entirely right and natural to him that we
should be seeing old Joe out. The mule walked his ceaseless
circle through the grove. He sensed our presence and now and then
plunged toward us as though for reassurance. Then Snow rose from
his heels by the fire and put out his hand to keep him from
crashing into the fence and spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Easy, Joe. Easy."</p>

<p>The mule stood a moment, wavering, then made his round again,
with death firm at the bridle.</p>

<p>I said, "I hate to keep you up late this way, Snow."</p>

<p>"That's plumb all right. He's likely to have a wild fit at the
end and hurt hisself. I reckon the dyin' itself won't hurt. I'd
hate to leave him alone. He's been mighty faithful."</p>

<p>Glenwood said, "Shore has been faithful."</p>

<p>Toward midnight I brought the boys ham and bread and coffee,
and the occasion in the bright cold moonlight was not at all a
sad one. All creatures must die and old Joe had had a good life,
as life goes for a mule, and not too hard a one, and now he had
companionship at the end. He came to the fence and whinnied and I
touched his nose. Then he broke into a gallop and when he was
done with that fine burst of living, he was done with it for
good.</p>

<p>"We done all we could," Snow said, and walked with Glenwood
home in the brightness.</p>

<p>In the early spring there was a circle marked in the maiden
cane where he had walked on his tether. There was a different
kind of grass that grew there. Even a mule, I thought, might
leave his mark a moment on the earth.</p>

<p>It was in a winter that Old Boss came very close to losing Old
Miss, and because of it, I knew him suddenly, not as the
patriarch of the Creek, venerable and invulnerable, of whom all
of us, black and white, stood in awe, but vulnerable, as we, to
those intimate, those personal things that make up life for human
beings. Old Miss was very ill, Martha told me, and I went down to
Old Boss' house to inquire of her. He came to the door in answer
to my question. His face wore its usual mask, kindly and
detached.</p>

<p>"She's not doing well," he said. "I'm afraid--I'll lose
her."</p>

<p>I put out my hand to touch him. The next moment he had reached
out his arms to me, and Old Boss was crying on my shoulder. I
held his small old body close to me and was astonished by its
frailty. He was not now the giver of laws, but a lonely little
old man weeping for his beloved. I knew in that instant how
fragile a defense are pride and authority against the common
enemies.</p>

<p>I thought, "How can any of us be cruel to one another? How are
wars possible, and hate, when we must all face such things? Death
is the enemy, and life itself is inimical, for all its bounty. We
must hold one another close against the cosmic perils."</p>

<p>For all our battles, winter at the Creek is the cozy time,
when fat pine fires crackle on all the hearths. I take my dog for
a walk up the road at sunset and the wind blows in our faces. I
turn back to walk westward home as the red sun drops behind
Orange Lake. The dusk comes quickly and we turn in at the gate
and shut the house door behind us and drop down in front of the
hearth fire in the living room. A fresh log of fatwood thrown on
the slow-burning bed of oak coals catches and blazes and roars up
the big chimney. The flames light the old white-walled room so
that there is no need even of candles, though one or two over the
bookshelves are always pleasant, for candlelight on books is one
of the lovely things of this world. The ruby-red velvet sleepy
hollow chair glows in the firelight. The dog groans for comfort
and turns his belly to the heat and stretches out his paws in the
ultimate luxury. Only a hunting dog or a cat can share man's love
of the open fire, and if I had a whole kennel full of dogs, on
winter nights I should let them all come in to enjoy mine with
me.</p>

<p>Sometimes the dog and I go together for our supper to the
old-fashioned kitchen where the wood range still glows and is
warm and the fire box blinks a red eye in the dusk. Because we
like the clean bare snugness of the room, and the bland heat of
the range, we often sit beside it when we have finished our bread
and Dora's rich milk, and converse together, wordlessly. We
drowse and nod and try to decide whether it would be more
pleasant to go back to the living-room fire or to go to bed. On
the bitter nights the dog is allowed to sleep inside by the fire,
and after his day's hunting he knows no greater delight or
security.</p>

<p>In the morning the red-birds sing in the crisp air and some
one, perhaps Martha, comes to my bedroom and lights a blazing
fire on the hearth for me, and when the room is warm I have my
tray of coffee, with cream as yellow as buttercups and so thick
it must be spooned into the cup, and I lie and watch the aromatic
wood burning and think, "What have I done to deserve such
munificence?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once I lost touch with the Creek. I had had hardships that
seemed to me more than one could bear alone. I loved the Creek, I
loved the grove, I loved the shabby farmhouse. Suddenly they were
nothing. The difficulties were greater than the compensations. I
talked morosely with my friend Dessie. I do not think she
understood my torment, for she is simple and direct and
completely adjusted to all living. She knew only that a friend
was in trouble.</p>

<p>She said, "We'll take one of those river trips we've talked
about. We'll take that eighteen-foot boat of yours with a couple
of outboard motors and put in at the head of the St. John's
River. We'll go down the river for several hundred miles."</p>

<p>I agreed, for the Creek was torture.</p>

<p>Men protested.</p>

<p>"Two women alone? The river runs through some of the wildest
country in Florida. You'll be lost in the false channels. No one
ever goes as far as the head of the river." Then, passionately,
betraying themselves, "It will be splendid. What if you do get
lost? Don't let any one talk you out of it."</p>

<p>The river was a blue smear through the marsh. The marsh was
tawny. It sprawled to the four points of the compass; flat;
interminable; meaningless.</p>

<p>I thought, "This is fantastic. I am about to deliver myself
over to a nightmare."</p>

<p>But life was a nightmare. The river was at least of my own
choosing.</p>

<p>The St. John's River flows from south to north and empties
into the Atlantic near the Florida-Georgia line. Its great mouth
is salt and tidal, and ocean-going vessels steam into it as far
as Jacksonville. It rises in a chain of small lakes near the
Florida east coast, south of Melbourne. The lakes are linked
together by stretches of marsh through which, in times of high
water, the indecisive course of the young river is discernible.
Two years of drought had shrunken the stream and dried the
marshes. The southernmost sources were overgrown with marsh
grass. Water hyacinths had filled the channels. The navigable
head of the St. John's proved to be near Fort Christmas, where
the highway crosses miles of wet prairie and cypress swamp
between Orlando and Indian River City.</p>

<p>There is a long high fill across the marsh, with a bridge over
the slight blue twisting that is the river. We drove car and
trailer down an embankment and unloaded the small boat in the
backwaters. The bank was of black muck, smelling of decay. It
sucked at our feet as we loaded our supplies. We took our places
in the boat and drifted slowly into mid-channel.</p>

<p>Water hyacinths began to pass us, moving with a faint anxiety
in their lifted leaves. The river was no more than a path through
high grass. We swung under the bridge and the boy at the wheel of
our car lifted his hand in parting and shot away. Something alive
and potent gripped the flat bottom of the boat. The hyacinths
moved more rapidly. The river widened to a few yards and rounded
a bend, suddenly decisive. Dess started the outboard motor. I
hunched myself together amidships and spread the U. S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey river chart on my knees and clicked open my
compass. I noticed disconsolately, "Lights, Beacons, Buoys and
Dangers Corrected for Information Received to Date of Issue."
There would be neither lights, beacons nor buoys for at least a
hundred miles. Bridge and highway disappeared, and there was no
longer any world but this incredible marsh, this unbelievable
amount of sky.</p>

<p>Half a mile beyond the bridge a fisherman's shack leaned over
the river. For sociability, we turned in by the low dock. The
fisherman and his wife squatted on their haunches and gave us
vague directions. We pointed to Bear Island on our chart.</p>

<p>He said, "You won't never see Bear Island. Where they got a
channel marked on your map it's plumb full o' hyacinths. Down the
river a ways you'll see a big ol' sugar-berry tree stickin' up in
the marsh. That's your mark. You keep to the left. The next mark
you'll get is a good ways down the river. You go left by a
pertickler tall piece o' grass."</p>

<p>The woman said, "You just got to keep tryin' for the main
channel. You'll get so you can tell."</p>

<p>The man said, "I ain't never been as far as you-all aim to go.
From what I hear, if you oncet get through Puzzle Lake, you got
right clare river."</p>

<p>The woman said, "You'll some kind of enjoy yourselves. The
river life's the finest kind of life. You couldn't get you no
better life than the river."</p>

<p>We pushed away from the dock.</p>

<p>The man said, "I'd be mighty well obliged if you'd send me a
postcard when you get where you're goin'. That-a-way I won't have
to keep on worryin' about you."</p>

<p>Dess cranked the motor and they waved after us. Dess began to
whistle, shrilly and tunelessly. She is an astonishing young
woman. She was born and raised in rural Florida and guns and
campfires and fishing-rods and creeks are corpuscular in her
blood. She lives a sophisticate's life among worldly people. At
the slightest excuse she steps out of civilization, naked and
relieved, as I should step out of a soiled chemise. She is ten
years my junior, but she calls me, with much tenderness, pitying
my incapabilities, "Young un."</p>

<p>"Young un," she called, "it's mighty fine to be
travelling."</p>

<p>I was prepared for marsh. It was startling to discover that
there was in sight literally nothing else. Far to the west,
almost out of sight to the east, in a dark line like cloud banks
was the distant swamp that edged this fluid prairie. We may have
taken the wrong channel for a mile or so, for we never saw the
sugar-berry tree; nothing but river grass, brittle and gold,
interspersed, where the ground was highest, with butter-yellow
flowers like tansy. By standing up in the boat I could see the
rest of the universe. And the universe was yellow marsh, with a
pitiless blue infinity over it, and we were lost at the
bottom.</p>

<p>At five o'clock in the afternoon the river dissolved without
warning into a two-mile spread of flat confusion. A mile of open
water lay ahead of us, neither lake nor river nor slough. We
advanced into the center. When we looked over our shoulders, the
marsh had closed in over the channel by which we had come. We
were in a labyrinth. The stretch of open water was merely the
fluid heart of a maze. Channels extended out of it in a hundred
directions--some shallow, obviously no outlets; others as broad
as the stream we had left behind us, and tempting. We tried four.
Each widened in a deceptive sweep. A circling of the shore-line
showed there was no channel. Each time we returned to the one
spot we could again identify--a point of marsh thrust into the
water like a swimming moccasin.</p>

<p>Dess said, "That map and compass don't amount to much."</p>

<p>That was my fault. I was totally unable to follow the chart. I
found later, too late for comfort, that my stupidity was not
entirely to blame, for, after the long drought, half the channels
charted no longer existed. The sun had become a prodigious red
disc dropping into a distant slough. Blue herons flew over us to
their night's quarters. Somewhere the river must continue neatly
out of this desolation. We came back once more to the point of
land. It was a foot or two out of water and a few square yards of
the black muck were comparatively dry. We beached the rowboat and
made camp.</p>

<p>There was no dry wood. We carried a bag of fat pine splinters
but it occurred to me desperately that I would save them. I laid
out a cold supper while Dess set up our two camp cots side by
side on the open ground. As the sun slid under the marsh to the
west, the full moon surged out of it to the east. The marsh was
silver and the water was steel, with ridges of rippled ebony
where ducks swam in the twilight. Mosquitoes sifted against us
like a drift of needles. We were exhausted. We propped our
mosquito bar over the cots on crossed oars, for there was no
bush, no tree, from which to hang it.</p>

<p>We did not undress, but climbed under the blankets. Three
people had had a hand in loading our cots and the wooden
end-pieces were missing. The canvas lay limp instead of taut, and
our feet hung over one end and our heads over the other, so that
we were disposed like corpses on inadequate stretchers. The
crossed oars slid slowly to the muck, the mosquito bar fluttered
down and mosquitoes were about us in a swarm. Dess reached under
her cot for her light rifle, propped it between us, and balanced
the mosquito bar accurately on the end of its barrel.</p>

<p>"You can get more good out of a .22 rifle than any other kind
of gun," she informed me earnestly.</p>

<p>I lay on my back in a torment of weariness, but there was no
rest. I had never lain in so naked a place, bared so flatly to
the sky. The moon swung high over us and there was no sleeping
for the brightness. Toward morning dewdrops collected over the
netting as though the moonlight had crystallized. I fell asleep
under a diamond curtain and wakened with warm full sunlight on my
face. Cranes and herons were wading the shore near me and Dess
was in the rowboat a few hundred yards away, casting for
bass.</p>

<p>Marsh and water glittered iridescent in the sun. The tropical
March air was fresh and wind-washed. I was suddenly excited. I
made campfire with fatwood splinters and cooked bacon and toast
and coffee. Their fragrance eddied across the water and I saw
Dess lift her nose and put down her rod and reel. She too was
excited.</p>

<p>"Young un," she called, "where's the channel?"</p>

<p>I pointed to the northeast and she nodded vehemently. It had
come to both of us like a revelation that the water hyacinths
were drifting faintly faster in that direction. From that instant
we were never very long lost. Forever after, where the river
sprawled in confusion, we might shut off the motor and study the
floating hyacinths until we caught, in one direction, a swifter
pulsing, as though we put our hands close and closer to the
river's heart. It was very simple. Like all simple facts, it was
necessary to discover it for oneself.</p>

<p>We had, in a moment, the feel of the river; a wisdom for its
vagaries. When the current took us away that morning, we gave
ourselves over to it. There was a tremendous exhilaration, an
abandoning of fear. The new channel was the correct one, as we
knew it should be. The river integrated itself again. The flat
golden banks closed in on both sides of us, securing a snug
safety. The strangeness of flowing water was gone, for it was all
there was of living.</p>

<p>In midmorning, solid land made its way here and there toward
us, and then in time withdrew. For a mile we had a low rolling
hill for company, with traces of ancient habitation at its peak:
a few yards of rotting fence, a crepe myrtle, an orange tree.</p>

<p>We passed a lone fisherman hauling his seine. His legs were
planted cranelike in the water. His long arms looped up folds of
the gray net with the rhythm of a man swinging a sickle. We told
him our origin and our destination. Because we were now a part of
the river he offered us a fish. His catch was meager and we
refused it. We passed cattle, wild on the marsh. They loomed
startlingly above us, their splotched black and brown and red and
white luminous against the blue sky, like cattle in Bonheur
pictures hung high above the eye-level.</p>

<p>The river dissolved into shallow pools and was interspersed
with small islands, palm-crowded and lonely. It was good to see
trees, lifting the eyes from so many miles of flatness. The pools
gathered themselves together and there was under us again a
river, confined between obvious banks. Sometimes the low-lying
land was dry for a great distance, specked with soapberry bushes,
and the wild cattle cropped a short grass that grew there.</p>

<p>We had Puzzle Lake and then Lake Harney, we knew, somewhere
ahead of us. We came out from a canal-like stretch of river into
a body of open water. Dess and I stiffened. She shut off the
motor.</p>

<p>Far away across the marsh there was a long white rolling as
though all the sheep in the world were being driven through
prehistoric dust clouds. The mad thought came to me that we had
embarked on the wrong river and had suddenly reached the ocean,
that the vast billowing in the distance was surf. But something
about the thing was familiar. That distant line was a fill, a
forty-foot sand embankment across the marsh between the St.
John's River and the east coast town of Mimms, and I had driven
its one-rut grade two weeks before. The marsh had been even more
desolate from the height of that untravelled, unfinished roadway.
The fill ended, I remembered, in a forty-foot drop to a decrepit
ferry that crossed the river. The billowing we now saw was loose
white sand moving along the embankment ahead of a high wind. I
ran my finger along the chart. There was no ferry mapped for the
far side of Puzzle Lake. A ferry was indicated, however, on the
far side of Lake Harney.</p>

<p>I said, "Dess, we've come through Puzzle Lake and didn't know
it. We've reached Lake Harney."</p>

<p>She did not question my surety. She spun the motor.</p>

<p>"All right, young un. Which way across?"</p>

<p>I compared chart and compass. I pointed. She headed the boat
as I directed. I split nautical points to keep our position
exactly. I took her across water so shoal we had to pole through
it; under overhanging banks and through dense stiff sedge, when
often a plainly better channel swung a few feet away in another
direction. The extreme low water, I called, had evidently dried
Lake Harney to this confused alternating of open lake and maze.
Dess whistled dubiously but asked no questions. We struck deep
water at last and were at the ferry I had indeed remembered. The
old ferryman peered from his hut and came down to meet us,
shading his eyes. He seemed to find us very strange indeed. Where
had we come from?</p>

<p>"We put in yesterday at Fort Christmas," I answered him, "and
I'm glad to say we've just finished navigating Lake Harney."</p>

<p>He stared in earnest.</p>

<p>"Lady," he said, "you haven't even reached Lake Harney. You've
just come through Puzzle Lake."</p>

<p>The ferry here simply was not charted, and the episode proves
anything one may wish it to prove. I felt contentedly that it
proved a harmony with the river so complete that not even the
mistaking of whole lakes could lose us. Others of more childish
faith were sure it proved the goodness of God in looking after
imbeciles. I know only that we were congratulated by fishermen
the entire length of the river on navigating Puzzle Lake
successfully.</p>

<p>"I brought our boat through Puzzle Lake," I told them with
simple dignity, "by the sternest use of chart and compass."</p>

<p>And it was only in Dess' more evil moments that she added,
"--in the firm belief that she was crossing Lake Harney."</p>

<p>Lake Harney itself was four miles long, unmistakably broad and
open. We crossed it in late afternoon with the westerly sun on
our left cheeks and a pleasant March wind ruffling the blue
water. Passing out of the lake we bought roe shad, fresh and
glistening from the seine. The current quickened. The hyacinths
plunged forward. The character of the river changed the instant
the lake was left behind. It was deep and swift, the color of
fine clear coffee that is poured with the sun against it. It was
mature. All its young torture was forgotten, and its wanderings
in the tawny marsh. The banks had changed. They were high. Tall
palms crowded great live oaks and small trees grew humbly in
their shadows. Toward sunset we swung under the western bank at
one of those spots a traveller recognizes instinctively as, for
the moment, home.</p>

<p>If I could have, to hold forever, one brief place and time of
beauty, I think I might choose the night on that high lonely bank
above the St. John's River. We found there a deserted cabin, gray
and smooth as only cypress weathers. There was no door for its
doorway, no panes or shutters for its windows, but the roof was
whole, with lichens thick across the shingles. Dess built me a
fire of red cedar. She sat on the sagging steps and whittled
endpieces for our cots, and I broiled shad and shad roe over
fragrant coals, and French-fried potatoes, and found I had the
ingredients for Tartar sauce.</p>

<p>Dess nailed a board between low rafters in the cabin from
which to hang the mosquito bar over our cots, and said, "Young
un, Christopher Columbus had nothing on us. He had a whole ocean
to fool around in, and a what-do-you-call-it:--a continent, to
come out on. Turn that boy loose in the St. John's marsh, and
he'd have been lost as a hound puppy."</p>

<p>We had hot baths out of a bucket that night, and sat on the
cabin steps in pajamas while the fire died down. Suddenly the
soft night turned silver. The moon was rising. We lay on our cots
a long time wakeful because of beauty. The moon shone through the
doorway and windows and the light was patterned with the shadows
of Spanish moss waving from the live oaks. There was a deserted
grove somewhere behind the cabin, and the incredible sweetness of
orange bloom drifted across us.</p>

<p>A mocking-bird sang from a palm tree at sunrise. We found by
daylight that the cabin sat among guava trees higher than the
roof. The yard was pink and white with periwinkles. Dess shot a
wild duck on the wing with the .22 and I roasted it in the Dutch
oven for breakfast. We lay all morning on the bank in the strong
sunlight, watching the mullet jumping in the river. At noon we
went reluctantly to the water's edge to load the boat and move
on. The boat was half filled with water and was resting with an
air of permanence on the river bottom.</p>

<p>My first thought was of pure delight that it was no longer
necessary to leave this place. But Dess was already stepping out
of her sailor trousers. I too removed superfluous clothing. We
bailed the boat and found two streams of water gushing in
steadily under bow and stern seats. We managed to drag the boat
on shore and turn it upside down. We found that the caulking had
worked loose out of two seams. Dess donated a shirt, and for two
hours with pocket knives we stuffed strips of cloth into
treacherous cracks. When we put the boat in the river again, the
caulking held.</p>

<p>I begged to stay another night, but Dess was restless. We
pushed on for the few hours left of daylight. The shore line
narrowed to thin strips of sand with tall twisted palms along
them. The clear brown river was glassy in the windless evening.
The palms were mirrored along both banks, so that when white
ibises flew over in a rosy sunset, the river might have been the
Nile.</p>

<p>We camped that night in comparative comfort under an upturned
tree root. The spot was not tempting from the water, but once we
were snugged down, it proved cavelike and cozy. A moccasin
slithered from under my feet at the edge of camp and went
harmlessly about his business. Dess cut down a young palmetto and
we had swamp cabbage for dinner. I cooked it with a piece of
white bacon and baked corn sticks in the Dutch oven to go with
it.</p>

<p>In the morning we watched the hyacinth drift closely to be
sure of taking the cut to Prairie Landing instead of wandering
into Lake Jessup. A highway crossed the river here and folk waved
down to us. In the cut a woman was running a catfish line. She
was gaunt and sun-tanned, ragged and dirty. She pulled in the
line, hand over hand, with a quick, desperate accuracy. She
lifted a shaggy head when we called "Howdy" and said "Hey," and
bent again to her line with a terrifying absorption. Something
about her shamed all soft, clean women.</p>

<p>We cut across the south end of Lake Monroe and found that it
was Sunday in the city of Sanford. We had reached the outpost of
large-vessel traffic on the St. John's, and we put-putted under
the bow of an incoming freight steamer. We had meant to bathe and
put on clean shirts and slacks that morning, but there had been
no landing place among the marshes. Dess strapped around her
waist the leather belt that held her bowie knife at one hip and
her revolver at the other, and felt better prepared for Sanford
than if we had been clean. She landed us neatly at the city dock,
in the lee of an immaculate pleasure yacht from Long Island
Sound. The owner, trim in double-breasted blue, came to the rail
and looked down at us. We had also intended to do a better job of
stowing. The bow end of our boat was piled untidily with our
supplies, our folded cots, our extra outboard motor and our
gasoline tins. Dess stood up in the stern and stretched and
shifted her armored belt.</p>

<p>She called up to the yacht owner, "Safe to come into this
town?"</p>

<p>"That depends on what you are coming for," he said, and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Not a thing but gasoline. Where's the nearest place a fellow
can fuel up?"</p>

<p>"All the filling stations near the docks are closed this
morning. But I'm having my yacht refuelled, and a station is
opening for me. How much do you need?"</p>

<p>Dess checked our tins with her eye.</p>

<p>"Five gallons is about right."</p>

<p>He smiled again.</p>

<p>"I'm sending my car to the station. If you will bring your
tins up, I'll be very happy to have my man take you along and
bring you back."</p>

<p>"Thanks, fellow," Dess said. "You're a white man."</p>

<p>There was a sound inside the yacht. There simmered up the
companionway a woman, magnificent in pink spectator sports
costume. The crew jumped almost to attention and escorted her
down the yacht's gangplank.</p>

<p>The woman snapped over her shoulders, "I must have the car at
once. I cannot be late to church for this nonsense."</p>

<p>Our white man turned rosy and made a comradely gesture to
us.</p>

<p>He leaned over and whispered, "The car will be back in just a
moment. If you don't mind waiting--. Please wait."</p>

<p>"O.K., fellow," Dess said.</p>

<p>The pink spectator sports swept into a limousine. In a few
minutes the car had returned. We were driven in style to a
filling station and our tins filled with gasoline. We bought the
New York Sunday papers. The yacht crew brought the tins down to
us and helped us re-stow our duffle. Dess outlined our trip
briefly to the owner. She cranked up and we were off again.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" called the yacht owner. "The very best of good
luck!"</p>

<p>He waved after us as far as we could see him, as though
reluctant to break a mystic thread. His face was wistful.</p>

<p>"The poor b--," Dess said pityingly and indignantly. "I'll bet
he'd give his silk shirt to go down the river with us instead of
with Pink Petticoats."</p>

<p>We used the gasoline and forgot to read the papers.</p>

<p>Out of Lake Monroe we began to see fishermen pulling seines
every few miles along the river. Here and there was a camp. Once
a palmetto thatching made a tip-tilted shelter and a startlingly
pretty girl in overalls looked out with a placid face. We passed
an old fisherman and a little girl in a boat. The child was
rowing. We encountered a tall lumber steamer in mid-stream. The
book of Pilot Rules on my lap provided that the boat in our
position should swing to starboard, passing to port, and should
give two short distinct blasts on the boat's whistle to signify
its intention. Two lusty blasts on my dog whistle brought no
answering blow from the steamer, but the cook, paring potatoes in
the open stern, waved to us as we angled to cross their wake.</p>

<p>We had "right clare river" now, the river life was indeed the
finest of lives, and there was no hurry left in the world. We put
up a golden-brown deep creek and fished all afternoon. A white
egret fished companionably with us a few yards away, and water
turkeys flapped their wings lazily from high cypresses. A water
moccasin arched his six feet of magnificent mottled hide between
a spider lily and a swamp laurel. The laurel was in full bloom
and the sunny creek was a wedge of fragrance. We found a white
sand bar and had a swim in water clear as amber.</p>

<p>Camp that night was on a pine bluff, very high and dry and
decent after the tree root and the moccasin. Storm threatened for
the first time and we stretched a tarpaulin between slash pines
to make a shelter. We were on the east bank. The moon and sun
rose behind us. In the morning we found that small animals had
dug holes all about us while we slept.</p>

<p>We pushed the motor that day. The river was deep and narrow.
The banks were dense swamp, black with undergrowth. A landing
would have been, for the most, impossible. We ate a cold lunch as
we travelled. Beyond Deland Landing we called at a houseboat
tethered to the bank. Its owner had been captain of the old Clyde
River Line, and he received our request for advice on crossing
Lake George with the old-school graciousness of large craft
meeting small. He took my compass well forward of the houseboat,
away from its metal stanchions, to chart our course across the
fourteen-mile lake the more precisely. I made the mental note
that perhaps I had better move the cast iron Dutch oven from
under my seat. He gave us a set of distance cards and a choice of
courses. The more sporting course was the main channel used by
large steamers. In a boat as small as ours we should be out of
sight of land for nearly an hour. The west channel never entirely
lost the land, but if it came on to blow, we would do best by
taking neither, and hugging the west shore. He bowed us
courteously on our way.</p>

<p>We planned to camp as close as possible that night to the
Volusia bar. We wanted to cross Lake George in the early morning
before the wind rose. Beyond the village of Astor the scrub
reared high against the west. Cypress swamp bordered the river.
There was scarcely a patch of ground large enough to step out on.
We pushed on to a cluster of fishing huts at the junction of lake
and river. Hyacinths moved here in vast green flexible sheets.
The huts were on stakes over the river and were not inviting.</p>

<p>Only one stood on enough ground to offer camping facilities.
We poled through the hyacinths and called from the rickety small
dock. A sullen-faced woman spoke curtly from the doorway. We
could see the interior of the shack. There were pallets on the
floor; a table; a chair or two. A dirty child peered from her
skirts. We were not wanted here, it was plain, but she was a
squatter, with no right to refuse us. Dess and I debated the
matter in low voices. The woman, the place, seemed to me
preferable to the dark swamp to which we must return. But the
wind was freshening from the west. Even now, hyacinths were
piling in behind us.</p>

<p>Dess said, "I'd rather sleep with a moccasin over each
shoulder than get caught in a hyacinth block."</p>

<p>We swung about to turn back up the river. As we pushed away,
the child dropped to the doorsill and began to pat his hands
together. He chanted with shrill delight, "They're going away!
They're going away!" I wondered what life had done to this woman
and this child, that, among a friendly fisher-folk, they should
know such fear and hate of strangers.</p>

<p>When the sun dropped behind the scrub, swamp and river were in
darkness. At twilight we had retraced several miles. When we
landed at the only promising opening, we found a comfortable
square of high ground. As we were making camp three fishermen
hailed us excitedly. Were we the women who had put in at Fort
Christmas nearly a week before? If so, they must know. Word had
been sent down the river from other fishermen to watch for us and
to report our safety. The three were camped across the river from
us. They had a trail cut into the swamp to a spot of sound dry
earth. Their campfire flickered sociably all night.</p>

<p>The course for the main channel was, simply, north by east.
But there was fog at daylight, and when the fog lifted a little
the wind came freshly from its week-long westerly quarter. Boats
twice our size had been in trouble on Lake George. Its squalls
were notably dangerous. It seemed needlessly heroic to deny
ourselves the comfort of the sight of land. We had no intention
of hugging the safe shore, so we compromised on the west channel.
We left the great channel markers behind and a gust of wind
twisted our stern. There was a half hour when the haze threatened
to obscure all visible shore lines. Then Drayton's Island lifted
ahead.</p>

<p>Midway, the wind was blowing the whitecaps off the waves, but
it was helpfully behind us. With both arms braced against the
steering handle of the motor, Dess kept the boat headed when
water that rolled like surf lifted our stern. The propeller
churned high out of the water. When it dropped again the boat
lunged and turned.</p>

<p>I called, "She's slueing badly!"</p>

<p>Dess shouted, "Young un, if you had this wind under your
stern, you'd slue, too!"</p>

<p>The distant shore seemed stationary. We passed the north point
of Drayton's Island, where the main channel joined the west, with
the lake boiling after us. At the first sheltered dock we stopped
to rest and an old Negro gave us fresh drinking water. We had
been some two and a half hours in crossing the lake.</p>

<p>The river resumed its broad quiet way as though it had left no
tumult behind it. It had the dignity of age, was not now in that
dark hurry to reach the sea. At Welaka one afternoon we left the
hyacinths swirling leisurely and turned up our home river, the
Ocklawaha. I thought in a panic, I shall never be happy on land
again. I was afraid once more of all the painful circumstances of
living.</p>

<p>But when the dry ground was under us, the world no longer
fluid, I found a forgotten loveliness in all the things that have
nothing to do with men. Beauty is pervasive, and fills, like
perfume, more than the object that contains it. Because I had
known intimately a river, the earth pulsed under me. The Creek
was home. Oleanders were sweet past bearing, and my own shabby
fields, weed-tangled, were newly dear. I knew, for a moment, that
the only nightmare is the masochistic human mind.</p>

<h2><a name="c23">23. <i>Who owns Cross Creek?</i></a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Thoreau went off to live in the woods alone, to find out what
the world was like. Now a man may learn a deal of the general
from studying the specific, whereas it is impossible to know the
specific by studying the general. For that reason, our
philosophers are usually the most unpractical of men, while very
simple folk may have a great deal of wisdom. A friend of mine
once entertained Einstein on her fishing yacht off Miami. She had
ordered the most elegant of lunches put up by the most elegant of
hotels. Einstein ate busily on his cold roast squab. He explored
the interior and pulled out its stuffing with a finger that had
measured the universe. The stuffing was a large French prune,
soaked in sherry and stuffed in turn with an almond. The great
man eyed it in horror and threw it overboard. He thought plainly
that the gizzard had not been removed. All his knowledge of light
and space had not fitted him to know that he would not, under any
circumstances, find an appended gizzard in a roast squab served
him on a yacht off Miami.</p>

<p>We at the Creek draw our conclusions about the world from our
intimate knowledge of one small portion of it.</p>

<p>Old Boss said, "The Creek doesn't amount to anything. The
people don't amount to anything. But if you're sick and have no
money, they'll cook for you and fetch it to you, and they'll
doctor you, and if you get past their doctoring, they'll send for
a doctor and pay his bill. And if you die, they'll take up a
collection and bury you. I figure it's just as close to Heaven
here as any other place."</p>

<p>Martha and Old Boss are the best of us, and we trail on down
through those of us doing the best we can with whatever we have
to work with, to those who make no effort at all, and these
lilies of the field are perhaps the most happily if the least
profitably adjusted to life of us all. I think we may have more
than the average share of tolerance and generosity. This is
because life has not been easy for any of us, and because we live
so close to one another's difficulties, in spite of our
individualistic detachment, that when one of us suffers, the rest
of us are outraged and wounded, too.</p>

<p>All of Cross Creek was disturbed when one of the women came
close to dying through having "thrown away," as Martha puts it,
an unborn child who had no right to enter the world under the
handicap of an already over-large family burdened with poverty.
Ordinarily Martha does not approve of such a "throwing away."</p>

<p>"I'se always taught my girls," she said, "to mind they manners
with the men. But I'se told 'em, too, does you do wrong, now
mind, does you, and you gets kotched--be lady enough to bring the
child into the world."</p>

<p>In this particular case, she understood its exigencies. I do
not know where or how Martha acquired her worldly wisdom, but she
knew the woman must have a "remedy" against similar future
catastrophes. She knew the best remedy recommended by the medical
profession and knew its cost.</p>

<p>"I'se talked to some o' the other ladies at the Creek," she
said, "an' times is so hard right now, cain't none of 'em
contribute. Hit takes three dollars, and I figured you might like
to know."</p>

<p>I gave her the three dollars to take to our neighbor, and the
offer of the grove truck to take her to the doctor as soon as she
was able. It is perhaps the strangest gift I have ever made.</p>

<p>We step on one another's toes at the Creek, inevitably, but
forgiveness follows quickly. Mr. Martin forgave my shooting of
his pig because I "talked so honest." We all forgave Henry his
shooting of Samson, because after all he was one of us, and we
loved the black rascal. Tom Glisson forgave me my injustice
against him. Our feud was violent.</p>

<p>One day my beautiful pointer dog, Mandy, struggled home from
her morning jaunt down the road and died within a few minutes in
convulsions. She had been killed by strychnine poison. I do not
know and perhaps shall never know who killed her, or whether the
matter was an unaccountable accident. At any rate, I laid the
blame on neighbor Tom, for it was reported to me soon after that
he had been heard to say he would not have a female dog at Cross
Creek. It seemed that backwoods morals were involved. The dog had
been in season and I had kept her shut up past the presumably
safe two weeks, then had set her loose. The backwoods is prudish,
and the mating of animals is not believed to be a salutary thing
for the young to observe. It seemed archaic to me to blame the
female and not the aggressive males.</p>

<p>I broke off relations with Tom and his friendly family,
forbade him to set foot on my land, even to drive out his cows,
refused to listen to his explanations, and made dire threats in
general. A year passed, a most unpleasant time, for all the Creek
was divided. It was necessary for the Glissons to pass my gate
with averted heads, and when we met in the village grocery store,
embarrassment took over the whole shabby building. At the end of
the year, my fences were found cut, and the hogs and cattle of
all the Creek were at large in my grove. I believe now that
vagrant hunters had taken the easiest way to get themselves and
their dogs across the property. At the time, nothing would do but
Tom was the culprit.</p>

<p>I sent a note to him: "Tom Glisson. I wish to see you. Hurry
up about it."</p>

<p>He came, and we laid the cards on the table. I stated my
grievances, and one by one he made a fool of me. He had indeed
said that he would not have a female dog at the Creek, but he had
meant, not that he would take a hand to prevent another from
having one, but that he himself would not choose to have one. He
reminded me of his own family's love of animals.</p>

<p>"I couldn't lift my hand against a dumb brute," he said, and
added, "nor, a speakin' one."</p>

<p>There was an unmistakable integrity in his facing of the
facts, going into each situation in detail. His blue eyes were
direct and clear. In a revelation, I knew the man's character.
Suddenly he burst into tears.</p>

<p>"That note you sent me. I'm as white as you are. You wrote
like I was a nigger."</p>

<p>I was sick with shame. I made my apologies, and I was in
tears, too. He wiped his away with the back of his calloused
hand.</p>

<p>"You abused me once, about the dog, and I forgive you
then."</p>

<p>He laid his big hands on my shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'll forgive you again."</p>

<p>We shook hands and agreed to a fresh start.</p>

<p>"All we got to do," he said, "is jest talk things over and
stick together."</p>

<p>I asked him then why another neighbor had insidiously tried to
lay on him the blame about my dog. He thought deeply.</p>

<p>"All I can figure is, he's jealous. He wanted to make trouble
for me. He ain't got anywhere in his life. You know how hard me
and my wife has worked. You know we want our young uns to get a
better chance in life than we've done had. We've got ahead a mite
by near about killin' ourselves, workin'. But some folks is
jealous of another stridin'."</p>

<p>Tom is one of my best friends today. It makes one very humble
to receive a forgiveness one does not deserve.</p>

<p>There was mutual forgiveness, too, in a passing triangle at
the Creek. Three people lived here for a brief time, a woman, her
sweetheart and her husband.</p>

<p>Tom told me, "Luke found the pair of 'em off in the flat woods
and he takened a notion to the woman. He washed her bottom and
put a clean shift on her and brought 'em both here, all
cozy-like."</p>

<p>The husband was much older than the woman and things seemed to
go smoothly for a while. Then one day he announced that he was
tired of fishing on the lake to make a living, while the newcomer
stayed in the house with his wife. He would either stay at home,
too, or the intruder could fish with him. The intruder meekly
fished with him. While both were absent, their suspicions grew
jointly. That strange community of men's reactions linked them
together. The sweetheart moved away and the husband moved
out.</p>

<p>Martha reported demurely, "Mr. Jackson done left he wife to
her devices. I seed him settin' out to move acrost the lake. Him
and his bed and his boat."</p>

<p>Soon after, the woman fell ill. Martha nursed her and we all
sent her supplies. The doctor reported there was no hope for her.
I suspect Martha of having a hand in the general reconciliation.
Sweetheart and husband came back to the woman and took turns at
taking care of her. The woman died and the two men went away
together, and the last I heard were farming and sharing, like
good bachelors, the housework.</p>

<p>I suppose there are a hundred other places where I might have
found what I found at Cross Creek. George Sand wrote, in "La Mare
au Diable":</p>

<p>"Nature possesses the secret of happiness, and no one has been
able to steal it from her. The happiest of men would be he who,
working intelligently and laboring with his hands, drawing
comfort and liberty from the exercise of his intelligent
strength, should have time to live through his heart and his
brain, to comprehend his own work and that of God. Happiness
would be wherever the mind, the heart and the arm should work
together beneath the eye of Providence, so that a holy harmony
should exist between the munificence of God and the rapture of
the human soul."</p>

<p>This holy harmony is the ideal, but it does not take into
account the dual nature of man and the dual nature of the
universe. All life is a balance, when it is not a battle, between
the forces of creation and the forces of destruction, between
love and hate, between life and death. Perhaps it is impossible
ever to say where one ends and the other begins, for even
creation and destruction are relative. This morning I crushed a
fuzzy black caterpillar. It was fulfilling its own destiny,
trying to complete its own life cycle. Its only sin was that it
was feeding on certain green leaves that I wished to look at. In
the brief instant after the crushing and before its death, did
its minute mind wonder why an unnamable catastrophe had overtaken
it? When a human life is snuffed out untimely, can there be
invisible forces whose wishes we offend? Can it be that one has
eaten green leaves? We should be so happy to cooperate with the
unvoiced demands if we were aware of them. The caterpillar would
be quite willing to nibble in an adjacent field, if the
completion of his life span could be so accomplished.</p>

<p>But in crushing the caterpillar, I have fed the ants. They are
hustling to the feast, already tunnelling the body. The ants
would applaud the treading of caterpillars. The death of a human
feeds, apparently, nothing. Or are there psychic things that are
nourished by our annihilation?</p>

<p>We know only that we are impelled to fight on the side of the
creative forces. We know only that a sense of well-being sweeps
over us when we have assisted life rather than destroyed it.
There is often an evil satisfaction in hate, satisfaction in
revenge, and satisfaction in killing. Yet when a wave of love
takes over a human being, love of another human being, love of
nature, love of all mankind, love of the universe, such an
exaltation takes him that he knows he has put his finger on the
pulse of the great secret and the great answer.</p>

<p>Here at Cross Creek we sense this, sometimes dimly, sometimes
strongly. Because we have adapted ourselves, with affection, to a
natural background that is congenial to us, we know that the
struggle is better done in love than in hate. We feel a great
pity for the industrial laborer who toils only for what it will
bring him in pay, and will not do his work unless his pay pleases
him. If we tillers of the soil sat down in a pet and refused to
turn our furrows because our crops had failed us, the world would
starve, for all its riches. We feel as great a pity for the
industrial capitalist who reckons living in terms of profit and
loss. Profit and loss are incidental to life, and surely there is
enough for us all. We know that work must be an intimate thing,
the thing one would choose to do if one had, as Tom said, "gold
buried in Georgia." We know above all that work must be
beloved.</p>

<p>We know that in our relations with one another, the
disagreements are unimportant and the union vital.</p>

<p>The question once arose, "Who owns Cross Creek?" It came to
expression when Mr. Marsh Turner was turning his hogs and cattle
loose on us and riding drunkenly across the Creek bridge to drive
them home. Tom Morrison, who does not own a blade of corn at the
Creek, but is yet part and parcel of it, became outraged by Mr.
Marsh Turner's arrogance. Tom stood with uplifted walking stick
at the bridge, a Creek Horatio, and turned Mr. Marsh Turner
back.</p>

<p>"Who do you think you are?" he demanded. "How come you figure
you can turn your stock loose on us, and then ride up and down,
whoopin' and hollerin'? You act like you own Cross Creek. You
don't. Old Boss owns Cross Creek, and Young Miss owns it, and old
Joe Mackay. Why, you don't own six feet of Cross Creek to be
buried in."</p>

<p>Soon after this noble gesture was reported to me by Martha, I
went across the Creek in April to gather early blackberries. I
had not crossed the bridge for some weeks and I looked forward to
seeing the magnolias in full bloom. The road is lined with
magnolia trees and is like a road passing through a superb park.
There were no magnolia blossoms. It seemed at first sight that
there were no magnolia trees. There were only tall, gray,
rose-lichened trunks from which the branches had been cut. The
pickers of magnolia leaves had passed through. These paid thieves
come and go mysteriously every second or third year. One week the
trees stand with broad outstretched branches, glossy of leaf, the
creamy buds ready for opening. The next, the boughs have been cut
close to the trunks, and it will be three years before there are
magnolia blossoms again. After long inquiry, I discovered the use
for the stripped leaves. They are used for making funeral
wreaths. The destruction seemed to me a symbol of private
intrusion on the right of all mankind to enjoy a universal
beauty. Surely the loveliness of the long miles of magnolia bloom
was more important to the living than the selling of the bronze,
waxy leaves for funerals of the dead.</p>

<p>I had a letter from a friend at this time, saying, "I am a
firm believer in property rights."</p>

<p>The statement disturbed me. What is "property" and who are the
legitimate owners? I looked out from my veranda, across the acres
of grove from which I had only recently been able to remove the
mortgage. The land was legally mine, and short of long tax
delinquency, nothing and nobody could take it from me. Yet if I
did not take care of the land lovingly, did not nourish and
cultivate it, it would revert to jungle. Was it mine to abuse or
to neglect? I did not think so.</p>

<p>I thought of the countless generations that had "owned" land.
Of what did that ownership consist? I thought of the great earth,
whirling in space. It was here ahead of men and could conceivably
be here after them. How should one man say that he "owned" any
piece or parcel of it? If he worked with it, labored to bring it
to fruition, it seemed to me that at most he held it in fief. The
individual man is transitory, but the pulse of life and of growth
goes on after he is gone, buried under a wreath of magnolia
leaves. No man should have proprietary rights over land who does
not use that land wisely and lovingly. Steinbeck raised the same
question in his <i>Grapes of Wrath.</i> Men who had cultivated
their land for generations were dispossessed because banks and
industrialists believed they could make a greater profit by
turning over the soil to mass, mechanized production. But what
will happen to that land when the industrialists themselves are
gone? The earth will survive bankers and any system of
government, capitalistic, fascist or bolshevist. The earth will
even survive anarchy.</p>

<p>I looked across my grove, hard fought for, hard maintained,
and I thought of other residents there. There are other
inhabitants who stir about with the same sense of possession as
my own. A covey of quail has lived for as long as I have owned
the place in a bramble thicket near the hammock. A pair of
blue-jays has raised its young, raucous-voiced and handsome, year
after year in the hickory trees. The same pair of red-birds mates
and nests in an orange tree behind my house and brings its
progeny twice a year to the feed basket in the crepe myrtle in
the front yard. The male sings with a <i>joie de vivre</i> no
greater than my own, but in a voice lovelier than mine, and the
female drops bits of corn into the mouths of her fledglings with
as much assurance as though she paid the taxes. A black snake has
lived under my bedroom as long as I have slept in it.</p>

<p>Who owns Cross Creek? The red-birds, I think, more than I, for
they will have their nests even in the face of delinquent
mortgages. And after I am dead, who am childless, the human
ownership of grove and field and hammock is hypothetical. But a
long line of red-birds and whippoorwills and blue-jays and ground
doves will descend from the present owners of nests in the orange
trees, and their claim will be less subject to dispute than that
of any human heirs. Houses are individual and can be owned, like
nests, and fought for. But what of the land? It seems to me that
the earth may be borrowed but not bought. It may be used, but not
owned. It gives itself in response to love and tending, offers
its seasonal flowering and fruiting. But we are tenants and not
possessors, lovers and not masters. Cross Creek belongs to the
wind and the rain, to the sun and the seasons, to the cosmic
secrecy of seed, and beyond all, to time.</p>
