<p>The road was heavy with mud. It was labour to move along it.
The old, wide way, forsaken and grown over with grass, used not
to be so bad. The farm traffic from Coney Grey must have cut it
up. The young man crossed carefully again to the strip of grass
on the other side.</p>

<p>It was a dreary, out-of-doors track, saved only by low
fragments of fence and occasional bushes from the desolation of
the large spaces of arable and of grassland on either side, where
only the unopposed wind and the great clouds mattered, where even
the little grasses bent to one another indifferent of any
traveller. The abandoned road used to seem clean and firm. Cyril
Mersham stopped to look round and to bring back old winters to
the scene, over the ribbed red land and the purple wood. The
surface of the field seemed suddenly to lift and break. Something
had startled the peewits, and the fallow flickered over with pink
gleams of birds white-breasting the sunset. Then the plovers
turned, and were gone in the dusk behind.</p>

<p>Darkness was issuing out of the earth, and clinging to the
trunks of the elms which rose like weird statues, lessening down
the wayside. Mersham laboured forwards, the earth sucking and
smacking at his feet. In front the Coney Grey farm was piled in
shadow on the road. He came near to it, and saw the turnips
heaped in a fabulous heap up the side of the barn, a buttress
that rose almost to the eaves, and stretched out towards the
cart-ruts in the road. Also, the pale breasts of the turnips got
the sunset, and they were innumerable orange glimmers piled in
the dusk. The two labourers who were pulping at the foot of the
mound stood shadow-like to watch as he passed, breathing the
sharp scent of turnips.</p>

<p>It was all very wonderful and glamorous here, in the old
places that had seemed so ordinary. Three-quarters of the scarlet
sun was settling among the branches of the elm in front, right
ahead where he would come soon. But when he arrived at the brow
where the hill swooped downwards, where the broad road ended
suddenly, the sun had vanished from the space before him, and the
evening star was white where the night urged up against the
retreating, rose-coloured billow of day. Mersham passed through
the stile and sat upon the remnant of the thorn tree on the brink
of the valley. All the wide space before him was full of a mist
of rose, nearly to his feet. The large ponds were hidden, the
farms, the fields, the far-off coal-mine, under the rosy
outpouring of twilight. Between him and the spaces of
Leicestershire and the hills of Derbyshire, between him and all
the South Country which he had fled, was the splendid rose-red
strand of sunset, and the white star keeping guard.</p>

<p>Here, on the lee-shore of day, was the only purple showing of
the woods and the great hedge below him; and the roof of the farm
below him, with a film of smoke rising up. Unreal, like a dream
which wastes a sleep with unrest, was the South and its hurrying
to and fro. Here, on the farther shore of the sunset, with the
flushed tide at his feet, and the large star flashing with
strange laughter, did he himself naked walk with lifted arms into
the quiet flood of life.</p>

<p>What was it he wanted, sought in the slowly-lapsing tide of
days? Two years he had been in the large city in the south. There
always his soul had moved among the faces that swayed on the
thousand currents in that node of tides, hovering and wheeling
and flying low over the faces of the multitude like a sea-gull
over the waters, stopping now and again, and taking a fragment of
life--a look, a contour, a movement--to feed upon. Of many
people, his friends, he had asked that they would kindle again
the smouldering embers of their experience; he had blown the low
fires gently with his breath, and had leaned his face towards
their glow, and had breathed in the words that rose like fumes
from the revived embers, till he was sick with the strong drug of
sufferings and ecstasies and sensations, and the dreams that
ensued. But most folk had choked out the fires of their fiercer
experience with rubble of sentimentality and stupid fear, and
rarely could he feel the hot destruction of Life fighting out its
way.</p>

<p>Surely, surely somebody could give him enough of the philtre
of life to stop the craving which tortured him hither and
thither, enough to satisfy for a while, to intoxicate him till he
could laugh the crystalline laughter of the star, and bathe in
the retreating flood of twilight like a naked boy in the surf,
clasping the waves and beating them and answering their wild
clawings with laughter sometimes, and sometimes gasps of
pain.</p>

<p>He rose and stretched himself. The mist was lying in the
valley like a flock of folded sheep; Orion had strode into the
sky, and the Twins were playing towards the West. He shivered,
stumbled down the path, and crossed the orchard, passing among
the dark trees as if among people he knew.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<p>II</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He came into the yard. It was exceedingly, painfully muddy. He
felt a disgust of his own feet, which were cold, and numbed, and
heavy.</p>

<p>The window of the house was uncurtained, and shone like a
yellow moon, with only a large leaf or two of ivy, and a cord of
honeysuckle hanging across it. There seemed a throng of figures
moving about the fire. Another light gleamed mysteriously among
the out-buildings. He heard a voice in the cow-shed, and the
impatient movement of a cow, and the rhythm of milk in the
bucket.</p>

<p>He hesitated in the darkness of the porch; then he entered
without knocking. A girl was opposite him, coming out of the
dairy doorway with a loaf of bread. She started, and they stood a
moment looking at each other across the room. They advanced to
each other; he took her hand, plunged overhead, as it were, for a
moment in her great brown eyes. Then he let her go, and looked
aside, saying some words of greeting. He had not kissed her; he
realised that when he heard her voice:</p>

<p>"When did you come?"</p>

<p>She was bent over the table, cutting bread-and-butter. What
was it in her bowed, submissive pose, in the dark, small head
with its black hair twining and hiding her face, that made him
wince and shrink and close over his soul that had been open like
a foolhardy flower to the night? Perhaps it was her very
submission, which trammelled him, throwing the responsibility of
her wholly on him, making him shrink from the burden of her.</p>

<p>Her brothers were home from the pit. They were two well-built
lads of twenty and twenty-one. The coal-dust over their faces was
like a mask, making them inscrutable, hiding any glow of
greeting, making them strangers. He could only see their eyes
wake with a sudden smile, which sank almost immediately, and they
turned aside. The mother was kneeling at a big brown stew-jar in
front of the open oven. She did not rise, but gave him her hand,
saying: "Cyril! How are you?" Her large dark eyes wavered and
left him. She continued with the spoon in the jar.</p>

<p>His disappointment rose as water suddenly heaves up the side
of a ship. A sense of dreariness revived, a feeling, too, of the
cold wet mud that he had struggled through.</p>

<p>These were the people who, a few months before, would look up
in one fine broad glow of welcome whenever he entered the door,
even if he came daily. Three years before, their lives would draw
together into one flame, and whole evenings long would flare with
magnificent mirth, and with play. They had known each other's
lightest and deepest feelings. Now, when he came back to them
after a long absence, they withdrew, turned aside. He sat down on
the sofa under the window, deeply chagrined. His heart closed
tight like a fir-cone, which had been open and full of naked
seeds when he came to them.</p>

<p>They asked him questions of the South. They were starved for
news, they said, in that God-forsaken hole.</p>

<p>"It is such a treat to hear a bit of news from outside," said
the mother.</p>

<p>News! He smiled, and talked, plucking for them the leaves from
off his tree: leaves of easy speech. He smiled, rather bitterly,
as he slowly reeled off his news, almost mechanically. Yet he
knew--and that was the irony of it--that they did not want his
"records"; they wanted the timorous buds of his hopes, and the
unknown fruits of his experience, full of the taste of tears and
what sunshine of gladness had gone to their ripening. But they
asked for his "news", and, because of some subtle perversity, he
gave them what they begged, not what they wanted, not what he
desired most sincerely to give them.</p>

<p>Gradually he exhausted his store of talk, that he had thought
was limitless. Muriel moved about all the time, laying the table
and listening, only looking now and again across the barren
garden of his talk into his windows. But he hardened his heart
and turned his head from her. The boys had stripped to their
waists, and had knelt on the hearth-rug and washed themselves in
a large tin bowl, the mother sponging and drying their backs. Now
they stood wiping themselves, the firelight bright and rosy on
their fine torsos, their heavy arms swelling and sinking with
life. They seemed to cherish the firelight on their bodies.
Benjamin, the younger, leaned his breast to the warmth, and threw
back his head, showing his teeth in a voluptuous little smile.
Mersham watched them, as he had watched the peewits and the
sunset.</p>

<p>Then they sat down to their dinners, and the room was dim with
the steam of food. Presently the father and the eldest brother
were in from the cow-sheds, and all assembled at table. The
conversation went haltingly; a little badinage on Mersham's part,
a few questions on politics from the father. Then there grew an
acute, fine feeling of discord. Mersham, particularly sensitive,
reacted. He became extremely attentive to the others at table,
and to his own manner of eating. He used English that was
exquisitely accurate, pronounced with the Southern accent, very
different from the heavily-sounded speech of the home folk. His
nicety contrasted the more with their rough, country habit. They
became shy and awkward, fumbling for something to say. The boys
ate their dinners hastily, shovelling up the mass as a man
shovels gravel. The eldest son clambered roughly with a great
hand at the plate of bread-and-butter. Mersham tried to shut his
eyes. He kept up all the time a brilliant tea-talk that they
failed to appreciate in that atmosphere. It was evident to him;
without forming the idea, he felt how irrevocably he was removing
them from him, though he had loved them. The irony of the
situation appealed to him, and added brightness and subtlety to
his wit. Muriel, who had studied him so thoroughly, confusedly
understood. She hung her head over her plate, and ate little. Now
and again she would look up at him, toying all the time with her
knife--though it was a family for ugly hands--and would address
him some barren question. He always answered the question, but he
invariably disregarded her look of earnestness, lapped in his
unbreakable armour of light irony. He acknowledged, however, her
power in the flicker of irritation that accompanied his reply.
She quickly hid her face again.</p>

<p>They did not linger at tea, as in the old days. The men rose,
with an "Ah well!" and went about their farm-work. One of the
lads lay sprawling for sleep on the sofa; the other lighted a
cigarette and sat with his arms on his knees, blinking into the
fire. Neither of them ever wore a coat in the house, and their
shirt-sleeves and their thick bare necks irritated the stranger
still further by accentuating his strangeness. The men came
tramping in and out to the boiler. The kitchen was full of
bustle, of the carrying of steaming water, and of draughts. It
seemed like a place out of doors. Mersham shrank up in his
corner, and pretended to read the <i>Daily News.</i> He was
ignored, like an owl sitting in the stalls of cattle.</p>

<p>"Go in the parlour, Cyril. Why don't you? It's comfortable
there."</p>

<p>Muriel turned to him with this reproach, this remonstrance,
almost chiding him. She was keenly aware of his discomfort, and
of his painful discord with his surroundings. He rose without a
word and obeyed her.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<p>III</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The parlour was a long, low room with red colourings. A bunch
of mistletoe hung from the beam, and thickly-berried holly was
over the pictures--over the little gilt-blazed water-colours that
he hated so much because he had done them in his 'teens, and
nothing is so hateful as the self one has left. He dropped in the
tapestried chair called the Countess, and thought of the changes
which this room had seen in him. There, by that hearth, they had
threshed the harvest of their youth's experience, gradually
burning the chaff of sentimentality and false romance that
covered the real grain of life. How infinitely far away, now,
seemed <i>Jane Eyre</i> and George Eliot. These had marked the
beginning. He smiled as he traced the graph onwards, plotting the
points with Carlyle and Ruskin, Schopenhauer and Darwin and
Huxley, Omar Khayyam, the Russians, Ibsen and Balzac; then Guy de
Maupassant and <i>Madame Bovary.</i> They had parted in the midst
of <i>Madame Bovary.</i> Since then had come only Nietzsche and
William James. They had not done so badly, he thought, during
those years which now he was apt to despise a little, because of
their dreadful strenuousness, and because of their later deadly,
unrelieved seriousness. He wanted her to come in and talk about
the old times. He crossed to the other side of the fire and lay
in the big horse-hair chair, which pricked the back of his head.
He looked about, and stuffed behind him the limp green cushions
that were always sweating down.</p>

<p>It was a week after Christmas. He guessed they had kept up the
holly and mistletoe for him. The two photographs of himself still
occupied the post of honour on the mantelpiece; but between them
was a stranger. He wondered who the fellow could be; good-looking
he seemed to be; but a bit of a clown beside the radiant, subtle
photos of himself. He smiled broadly at his own arrogance. Then
he remembered that Muriel and her people were leaving the farm
come Lady-day. Immediately, in valediction, he began to call up
the old days, when they had romped and played so boisterously,
dances, and wild charades, and all mad games. He was just telling
himself that those were the days, the days of unconscious,
ecstatic fun, and he was smiling at himself over his information,
when she entered.</p>

<p>She came in, hesitating. Seeing him sprawling in his old
abandonment, she closed the door softly. For a moment or two she
sat, her elbows on her knees, her chin in her hands, sucking her
little finger, and withdrawing it from her lips with a little
pop, looking all the while in the fire. She was waiting for him,
knowing all the time he would not begin. She was trying to feel
him, as it were. She wanted to assure herself of him after so
many months. She dared not look at him directly. Like all
brooding, constitutionally earnest souls, she gave herself away
unwisely, and was defenceless when she found herself pushed back,
rejected so often with contempt.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me you were coming?" she asked at
last.</p>

<p>"I wanted to have exactly one of the old tea-times, and
evenings."</p>

<p>"Ay!" she answered with hopeless bitterness. She was a
dreadful pessimist. People had handled her so brutally, and had
cheaply thrown away her most sacred intimacies.</p>

<p>He laughed, and looked at her kindly.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, if I'd thought about it I should have known this
was what to expect. It's my own fault."</p>

<p>"Nay," she answered, still bitterly; "it's not your fault.
It's ours. You bring us to a certain point, and when you go away,
we lose it all again, and receive you like creatures who have
never known you."</p>

<p>"Never mind," he said easily. "If it is so, it is! How are
you?"</p>

<p>She turned and looked full at him. She was very handsome;
heavily moulded, coloured richly. He looked back smiling into her
big, brown, serious eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm very well," she answered, with puzzled irony. "How
are you?"</p>

<p>"Me? You tell me. What do you think of me?"</p>

<p>"What do I think?" She laughed a little nervous laugh and
shook her head. "I don't know. Why--you look well--and very much
of a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Ah--and you are sorry?"</p>

<p>"No--No, I am not! No! Only you're different, you see."</p>

<p>"Ah, the pity! I shall never be as nice as I was at
twenty-one, shall I?" He glanced at his photo on the mantelpiece,
and smiled, gently chaffing her.</p>

<p>"Well--you're different--it isn't that you're not so nice, but
different. I always think you're like that, really."</p>

<p>She too glanced at the photo, which had been called the
portrait of an intellectual prig, but which was really that of a
sensitive, alert, exquisite boy. The subject of the portrait lay
smiling at her. Then it turned voluptuously, like a cat spread
out in the chair.</p>

<p>"And this is the last of it all--!"</p>

<p>She looked up at him, startled and pitiful.</p>

<p>"Of this phase, I mean," he continued, indicating with his
eyes the room, the surroundings. "Of Crossleigh Bank, I mean, and
this part of our lives."</p>

<p>"Ay!" she said, bowing her head, and putting into the
exclamation all her depth of sadness and regret. He laughed.</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad?" he asked.</p>

<p>She looked up, startled, a little shocked.</p>

<p>"Good-bye's a fine word," he explained. "It means you're going
to have a change, and a change is what you, of all people,
want."</p>

<p>Her expression altered as she listened.</p>

<p>"It's true," she said. "I do."</p>

<p>"So you ought to say to yourself, 'What a treat! I'm going to
say good-bye directly to the most painful phase of my life.' You
make up your mind it shall be the most painful, by refusing to be
hurt so much in the future. There you are! 'Men at most times are
masters of their fates,' etcetera."</p>

<p>She pondered his method of reasoning, and turned to him with a
little laughter that was full of pleading and yearning.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, lying, amiably smiling, "isn't that so?--and
aren't you glad?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" she nodded. "I am--very glad."</p>

<p>He twinkled playfully at her, and asked, in a soft voice:</p>

<p>"Then what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, a little breathlessly. "What do I?" She
looked at him with a rash challenge that pricked him.</p>

<p>"Nay," he said, evading her, "do you even ask me that?"</p>

<p>She veiled her eyes, and said, meekly in excuse:</p>

<p>"It's a long time since I asked you anything, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ay! I never thought of it. Whom have you asked in the
interim?"</p>

<p>"Whom have I asked?"--she arched her brows and laughed a
monosyllable of scorn.</p>

<p>"No one, of course!" he said, smiling. "The world asks
questions of you, you ask questions of me, and I go to some
oracle in the dark, don't I?"</p>

<p>She laughed with him.</p>

<p>"No!" he said, suddenly serious. "Supposing you must answer me
a big question--something I can never find out by myself?"</p>

<p>He lay out indolently in the chair and began smiling again.
She turned to look with intensity at him, her hair's fine foliage
all loose round her face, her dark eyes haunted with doubt, her
finger at her lips. A slight perplexity flickered over his
eyes.</p>

<p>"At any rate," he said, "you have something to give me."</p>

<p>She continued to look at him with dark, absorbing eyes. He
probed her with his regard. Then he seemed to withdraw, and his
pupils dilated with thought.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "life's no good but to live--and you can't
live your life by yourself. You must have a flint and a steel,
both, to make the spark fly. Supposing you be my flint, my white
flint, to spurt out red fire for me?"</p>

<p>"But how do you mean?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"You see," he continued, thinking aloud as usual:
"thought--that's not life. It's like washing and combing and
carding and weaving the fleece that the year of life has
produced. Now I think--we've carded and woven to the end of our
bundle--nearly. We've got to begin again--you and me--living
together, see? Not speculating and poetising together--see?"</p>

<p>She did not cease to gaze absorbedly at him.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she whispered, urging him on.</p>

<p>"You see--I'll come back to you--to you--" He waited for
her.</p>

<p>"But," she said huskily, "I don't understand."</p>

<p>He looked at her with aggressive frankness, putting aside all
her confusions.</p>

<p>"Fibber!" he said gently.</p>

<p>"But--" she turned in her chair from him--"but not
clearly."</p>

<p>He frowned slightly:</p>

<p>"Nay, you should be able by now to use the algebra of speech.
Must I count up on your fingers for you what I mean, unit by
unit, in bald arithmetic?"</p>

<p>"No--no!" she cried, justifying herself; "but how can I
understand--the change in you? You used to say--you
couldn't.--Quite opposite."</p>

<p>He lifted his head as if taking in her meaning.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I have changed. I forget. I suppose I must have
changed in myself. I'm older--I'm twenty-six. I used to shrink
from the thought of having to kiss you, didn't I?" He smiled very
brightly, and added, in a soft voice: "Well--I don't, now."</p>

<p>She flushed darkly and hid her face from him.</p>

<p>"Not," he continued, with slow, brutal candour--"not that I
know any more than I did then--what love is--as you know
it--but--I think you're beautiful--and we know each other so
well--as we know nobody else, don't we? And so we . . ."</p>

<p>His voice died away, and they sat in a tense silence,
listening to the noise outside, for the dog was barking loudly.
They heard a voice speaking and quieting him. Cyril Mersham
listened. He heard the clatter of the barn door latch, and a
slurring ring of a bicycle-bell brushing the wall.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked, unsuspecting.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and confessed with her eyes, guiltily,
beseeching. He understood immediately.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!--Him?" He looked at the photo on the mantelpiece.
She nodded with her usual despair, her finger between her lips
again. Mersham took some moments to adjust himself to the new
situation.</p>

<p>"Well!--so <i>he's</i> in my place! Why didn't you tell
me?"</p>

<p>"How could I?--he's not. Besides--you never would have a
place." She hid her face.</p>

<p>"No," he drawled, thinking deeply. "I wouldn't. It's my fault
altogether." Then he smiled, and said whimsically: "But I thought
you kept an old pair of my gloves in the chair beside you."</p>

<p>"So I did, so I did!" she justified herself again with extreme
bitterness, "till you asked me for them. You told me to--to take
another man--and I did as you told me--as usual."</p>

<p>"Did I tell you?--did I tell you? I suppose I must. I suppose
I am a fool. And do you like him?"</p>

<p>She laughed aloud, with scorn and bitterness.</p>

<p>"He's very good--and he's very fond of me."</p>

<p>"Naturally!" said Mersham, smiling and becoming ironical. "And
how firmly is he fixed?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>She was mortified, and would not answer him. The question for
him now was how much did this intruder count. He looked, and saw
she wore no ring--but perhaps she had taken it off for his
coming. He began diligently to calculate what attitude he might
take. He had looked for many women to wake his love, but he had
been always disappointed. So he had kept himself virtuous, and
waited. Now he would wait no longer. No woman and he could ever
understand each other so well as he and Muriel whom he had
fiercely educated into womanhood along with his own struggling
towards a manhood of independent outlook. They had breathed the
same air of thought, they had been beaten with the same storms of
doubt and disillusionment, they had expanded together in days of
pure poetry. They had grown so; spiritually, or rather
psychically, as he preferred to say, they were married; and now
he found himself thinking of the way she moved about the
house.</p>

<p>The outer door had opened and a man had entered the kitchen,
greeting the family cordially, and without any formality. He had
the throaty, penetrating voice of a tenor singer, and it came
distinctly over the vibrating rumble of the men's talking. He
spoke good, easy English. The boys asked him about the "iron-men"
and the electric haulage, and he answered them with rough
technicalities, so Mersham concluded he was a working electrician
in the mine. They continued to talk casually for some time,
though there was a false note of secondary interest in it all.
Then Benjamin came forward and broke the check, saying, with a
dash of braggart taunting:</p>

<p>"Muriel's in th' parlour, Tom, if you want her."</p>

<p>"Oh, is she? I saw a light in; I thought she might be." He
affected indifference, as if he were kept thus at every visit.
Then he added, with a touch of impatience, and of the
proprietor's interest: "What is she doing?"</p>

<p>"She's talking. Cyril Mersham's come from London."</p>

<p>"What!--is <i>he</i> here?"</p>

<p>Mersham sat listening, smiling. Muriel saw his eyelids lift.
She had run up her flag of challenge taut, but continually she
slackened towards him with tenderness. Now her flag flew out
bravely. She rose, and went to the door.</p>

<p>"Hello!" she said, greeting the stranger with a little song of
welcome in one word, such as girls use when they become aware of
the presence of their sweetheart.</p>

<p>"You've got a visitor, I hear," he answered.</p>

<p>"Yes. Come along, come in!"</p>

<p>She spoke softly, with much gentle caressing.</p>

<p>He was a handsome man, well set-up, rather shorter than
Mersham. The latter rose indolently, and held out his hand,
smiling curiously into the beautiful, generous blue eyes of the
other.</p>

<p>"Cyril--Mr. Vickers."</p>

<p>Tom Vickers crushed Mersham's hand, and answered his steady,
smiling regard with a warm expansion of feeling, then bent his
head, slightly confused.</p>

<p>"Sit here, will you?" said Mersham, languidly indicating the
armchair.</p>

<p>"No, no, thanks, I won't. I shall do here, thanks." Tom
Vickers took a chair and placed it in front of the fire. He was
confusedly charmed with Mersham's natural frankness and
courtesy.</p>

<p>"If I'm not intruding," he added, as he sat down.</p>

<p>"No, of course not!" said Muriel, in her wonderfully soft,
fond tones--the indulgent tone of a woman who will sacrifice
anything to love.</p>

<p>"Couldn't!" added Mersham lazily. "We're always a public
meeting, Muriel and I. Aren't we, Miel? We're discussing
affinities, that ancient topic. You'll do for an audience. We
agree so beastly well, we two. We always did. It's her fault.
Does she treat you so badly?"</p>

<p>The other was rather bewildered. Out of it all he dimly
gathered that he was suggested as the present lover of Muriel,
while Mersham referred to himself as the one discarded. So he
smiled, reassured.</p>

<p>"How--badly?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Agreeing with you on every point?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't say she does that," said Vickers, smiling, and
looking with little warm glances at her.</p>

<p>"Why, we never disagree, you know!" she remonstrated, in the
same deep indulgent tone.</p>

<p>"I see," Mersham said languidly, and yet keeping his wits
keenly to the point. "<i>You</i> agree with everything <i>she</i>
says. Lord, how interesting!"</p>

<p>Muriel arched her eyelids with a fine flare of intelligence
across at him, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Something like that," answered the other man, also
indulgently, as became a healthy male towards one who lay limply
in a chair and said clever nothings in a lazy drawl. Mersham
noted the fine limbs, the solid, large thighs, and the thick
wrists. He was classifying his rival among the men of handsome,
healthy animalism, and good intelligence, who are children in
simplicity, who can add two and two, but never xy and yx. His
contours, his movements, his repose were, strictly, lovable.
"But," said Mersham to himself, "if I were blind, or sorrowful,
or very tired, I should not want him. He is one of the men, as
George Moore says, whom his wife would hate after a few years for
the very way he walked across the floor. I can imagine him with a
family of children, a fine father. But unless he had a domestic
wife--"</p>

<p>Muriel had begun to make talk to him.</p>

<p>"Did you cycle?" she asked, in that irritating private tone so
common to lovers, a tone that makes a third person an
impertinence.</p>

<p>"Yes--I was rather late," he replied, in the same caressing
manner. The sense did not matter, the caress was everything.</p>

<p>"Didn't you find it very muddy?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did--but not any worse than yesterday."</p>

<p>Mersham sprawled his length in the chair, his eyelids almost
shut, his fine white hands hanging over the arms of the chair
like dead-white stoats from a bough. He was wondering how long
Muriel would endure to indulge her sweetheart thus. Soon she
began to talk second-hand to Mersham. They were speaking of Tom's
landlady.</p>

<p>"You don't care for her, do you?" she asked, laughing
insinuatingly, since the shadow of his dislike for other women
heightened the radiance of his affection for her.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say that I love her."</p>

<p>"How is it you always fall out with your landladies after six
months? You must be a wretch to live with."</p>

<p>"Nay, I don't know that I am. But they're all alike; they're
jam and cakes at first, but after a bit they're dry bread."</p>

<p>He spoke with solemnity, as if he uttered a universal truth.
Mersham's eyelids flickered now and again. Muriel turned to
him:</p>

<p>"Mr. Vickers doesn't like lodgings," she said.</p>

<p>Mersham understood that Vickers therefore wanted to marry her;
he also understood that as the pretendant tired of his
landladies, so his wife and he would probably weary one another.
He looked this intelligence at Muriel, and drawled:</p>

<p>"Doesn't he? Lodgings are ideal. A good lodger can always boss
the show, and have his own way. It's the time of his life."</p>

<p>"I don't think!" laughed Vickers.</p>

<p>"It's true," drawled Mersham torpidly, giving his words the
effect of droll irony. "You're evidently not a good lodger. You
only need to sympathise with a landlady--against her husband
generally--and she'll move heaven and earth for you."</p>

<p>"Ah!" laughed Muriel, glancing at Mersham. "Tom doesn't
believe in sympathising with women--especially married
women."</p>

<p>"I don't!" said Tom emphatically, "--it's dangerous."</p>

<p>"You leave it to the husband," said Mersham.</p>

<p>"I do that! I don't want 'em coming to me with their troubles.
I should never know the end."</p>

<p>"Wise of you. Poor woman! So you'll broach your barrel of
sympathy for your wife, eh, and for nobody else?"</p>

<p>"That's it. Isn't that right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite. Your wife will be a privileged person. Sort of
homebrewed beer to drink <i>ad infinitum?</i> Quite all right,
that!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing better," said Tom, laughing.</p>

<p>"Except a change," said Mersham. "Now, I'm like a cup of tea
to a woman."</p>

<p>Muriel laughed aloud at this preposterous cynicism, and
knitted her brows to bid him cease playing ball with bombs.</p>

<p>"A fresh cup each time. Women never weary of tea. Muriel, I
can see you having a rich time. Sort of long after-supper drowse
with a good husband."</p>

<p>"Very delightful!" said Muriel sarcastically.</p>

<p>"If she's got a good husband, what more can she want?" asked
Tom, keeping the tone of banter, but really serious and somewhat
resentful.</p>

<p>"A lodger--to make things interesting."</p>

<p>"Why," said Muriel, intervening, "do women like you so?"</p>

<p>Mersham looked up at her, quietly, smiling into her eyes. She
was really perplexed. She wanted to know what he put in the pan
to make the balance go down so heavily on his side. He had, as
usual, to answer her seriously and truthfully, so he said:
"Because I can make them believe that black is green or
purple--which it is, in reality." Then, smiling broadly as she
wakened again with admiration for him, he added: "But you're
trying to make me conceited, Miel--to stain my virgin
modesty."</p>

<p>Muriel glanced up at him with softness and understanding, and
laughed low. Tom gave a guffaw at the notion of Mersham's virgin
modesty. Muriel's brow wrinkled with irritation, and she turned
from her sweetheart to look in the fire.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<p>V</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mersham, all unconsciously, had now developed the situation to
the climax he desired. He was sure that Vickers would not count
seriously in Muriel's movement towards himself. So he turned
away, uninterested.</p>

<p>The talk drifted for some time, after which he suddenly
bethought himself:</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Vickers, will you sing for us? You do sing, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well--nothing to speak of," replied the other modestly,
wondering at Mersham's sudden change of interest. He looked at
Muriel.</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered him, indulging him now like a child.
"But--" she turned to Mersham--"but do you, really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Play some of the old songs. Do you play any
better?"</p>

<p>She began "Honour and Arms".</p>

<p>"No, not that!" cried Mersham. "Something quiet--'<i>Sois
triste et sois belle</i>'." He smiled gently at her,
suggestively. "Try '<i>Du</i> <i>bist wie eine Blume</i>' or
'<i>Pur dicesti</i>'."</p>

<p>Vickers sang well, though without much imagination. But the
songs they sang were the old songs that Mersham had taught Muriel
years before, and she played with one of his memories in her
heart. At the end of the first song, she turned and found him
looking at her, and they met again in the poetry of the past.</p>

<p>"Daffodils," he said softly, his eyes full of memories.</p>

<p>She dilated, quivered with emotion, in response. They had sat
on the rim of the hill, where the wild daffodils stood up to the
sky, and there he had taught her, singing line by line: "<i>Du
bist wie eine Blume</i>." He had no voice, but a very accurate
ear.</p>

<p>The evening wore on to ten o'clock. The lads came through the
room on their way to bed. The house was asleep save the father,
who sat alone in the kitchen, reading <i>The Octopus.</i> They
went in to supper.</p>

<p>Mersham had roused himself and was talking well. Muriel
stimulated him, always, and turned him to talk of art and
philosophy--abstract things that she loved, of which only he had
ever spoken to her, of which only he could speak, she believed,
with such beauty. He used quaint turns of speech, contradicted
himself waywardly, then said something sad and whimsical, all in
a wistful, irresponsible manner so that even the men leaned
indulgent and deferential to him.</p>

<p>"Life," he said, and he was always urging this on Muriel in
one form or another, "life is beautiful, so long as it is
consuming you. When it is rushing through you, destroying you,
life is glorious. It is best to roar away, like a fire with a
great draught, white-hot to the last bit. It's when you burn a
slow fire and save fuel that life's not worth having."</p>

<p>"You believe in a short life and a merry," said the
father.</p>

<p>"Needn't be either short or merry. Grief is part of the fire
of life--and suffering--they're the root of the flame of joy, as
they say. No! With life, we're like the man who was so anxious to
provide for his old age that he died at thirty from
inanition."</p>

<p>"That's what we're not likely to do," laughed Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. You live most intensely in human
contact--and that's what we shrink from, poor timid creatures,
from giving our souls to somebody to touch; for they, bungling
fools, will generally paw it with dirty hands."</p>

<p>Muriel looked at him with dark eyes of grateful understanding.
She herself had been much pawed, brutally, by her brothers. But,
then, she had been foolish in offering herself.</p>

<p>"And," concluded Mersham, "you are washed with the whitest
fire of life--when you take a woman you love--and
understand."</p>

<p>Perhaps Mersham did not know what he was doing. Yet his whole
talk lifted Muriel as in a net, like a sea-maiden out of the
waters, and placed her in his arms, to breathe his thin, rare
atmosphere. She looked at him, and was certain of his pure
earnestness, and believed implicitly he could not do wrong.</p>

<p>Vickers believed otherwise. He would have expressed his
opinion, whatever it might be, in an: "Oh, ay, he's got plenty to
say, and he'll keep on saying it--but, hang it all . . .!"</p>

<p>For Vickers was an old-fashioned, inarticulate lover; such as
has been found the brief joy and the unending disappointment of a
woman's life. At last he found he must go, as Mersham would not
precede him. Muriel did not kiss him good-bye, nor did she offer
to go out with him to his bicycle. He was angry at this, but more
angry with the girl than with the man. He felt that she was
fooling about, "showing off" before the stranger. Mersham was a
stranger to him, and so, in his idea, to Muriel. Both young men
went out of the house together, and down the rough brick track to
the barn. Mersham made whimsical little jokes: "I wish my feet
weren't so fastidious. They dither when they go in a soft spot
like a girl who's touched a toad. Hark at that poor old
wretch--she sounds as if she'd got whooping-cough."</p>

<p>"A cow is not coughing when she makes that row," said
Vickers.</p>

<p>"Pretending, is she?--to get some Owbridge's? Don't blame her.
I guess she's got chilblains, at any rate. Do cows have
chilblains, poor devils?"</p>

<p>Vickers laughed and felt he must take this man into his
protection. "Mind," he said, as they entered the barn, which was
very dark. "Mind your forehead against this beam." He put one
hand on the beam, and stretched out the other to feel for
Mersham. "Thanks," said the latter gratefully. He knew the
position of the beam to an inch, however dark the barn, but he
allowed Vickers to guide him past it. He rather enjoyed being
taken into Tom's protection.</p>

<p>Vickers carefully struck a match, bowing over the ruddy core
of light and illuminating himself like some beautiful lantern in
the midst of the high darkness of the barn. For some moments he
bent over his bicycle-lamp, trimming and adjusting the wick, and
his face, gathering all the light on its ruddy beauty, seemed
luminous and wonderful. Mersham could see the down on his cheeks
above the razor-line, and the full lips in shadow beneath the
moustache, and the brush of the eyebrows between the light.</p>

<p>"After all," said Mersham, "he's very beautiful; she's a fool
to give him up."</p>

<p>Tom shut the lamp with a snap, and carefully crushed the match
under his foot. Then he took the pump from the bicycle, and
crouched on his heels in the dimness, inflating the tyre. The
swift, unerring, untiring stroke of the pump, the light balance
and the fine elastic adjustment of the man's body to his
movements pleased Mersham.</p>

<p>"She could have," he was saying to himself, "some glorious
hours with this man--yet she'd rather have me, because I can make
her sad and set her wondering."</p>

<p>But to the man he was saying:</p>

<p>"You know, love isn't the twin-soul business. With you, for
instance, women are like apples on a tree. You can have one that
you can reach. Those that look best are overhead, but it's no
good bothering with them. So you stretch up, perhaps you pull
down a bough and just get your fingers round a good one. Then it
swings back and you feel wild and you say your heart's broken.
But there are plenty of apples as good for you no higher than
your chest."</p>

<p>Vickers smiled, and thought there was something in
it--generally; but for himself, it was nothing.</p>

<p>They went out of the barn to the yard gate. He watched the
young man swing over his saddle and vanish, calling
"Good-night."</p>

<p>"<i>Sic transit</i>," he murmured--meaning Tom Vickers, and
beautiful lustihood that is unconscious like a blossom.</p>

<p>Mersham went slowly in the house. Muriel was clearing away the
supper things, and laying the table again for the men's
breakfasts. But she was waiting for him as clearly as if she had
stood watching in the doorway. She looked up at him, and
instinctively he lifted his face towards her as if to kiss her.
They smiled, and she went on with her work.</p>

<p>The father rose, stretching his burly form, and yawning.
Mersham put on his overcoat.</p>

<p>"You will come a little way with me?" he said. She answered
him with her eyes. The father stood, large and silent, on the
hearth-rug. His sleepy, mazed disapproval had no more effect than
a little breeze which might blow against them. She smiled
brightly at her lover, like a child, as she pinned on her
hat.</p>

<p>It was very dark outside in the starlight. He groaned heavily,
and swore with extravagance as he went ankle-deep in mud.</p>

<p>"See, you should follow me. Come here," she commanded,
delighted to have him in charge.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand," he said, and they went hand-in-hand over
the rough places. The fields were open, and the night went up to
the magnificent stars. The wood was very dark, and wet; they
leaned forward and stepped stealthily, and gripped each other's
hands fast with a delightful sense of adventure. When they stood
and looked up a moment, they did not know how the stars were
scattered among the tree-tops till he found the three jewels of
Orion right in front.</p>

<p>There was a strangeness everywhere, as if all things had
ventured out alive to play in the night, as they do in
fairy-tales; the trees, the many stars, the dark spaces, and the
mysterious waters below uniting in some magnificent game.</p>

<p>They emerged from the wood on to the bare hillside. She came
down from the wood-fence into his arms, and he kissed her, and
they laughed low together. Then they went on across the wild
meadows where there was no path.</p>

<p>"Why don't you like him?" he asked playfully.</p>

<p>"Need you ask?" she said simply.</p>

<p>"Yes. Because he's heaps nicer than I am."</p>

<p>She laughed a full laugh of amusement.</p>

<p>"He is! Look! He's like summer, brown and full of warmth.
Think how splendid and fierce he'd be--"</p>

<p>"Why do you talk about him?" she said.</p>

<p>"Because I want you to know what you're losing--and you won't
till you see him in my terms. He is very desirable--I should
choose him in preference to me--for myself."</p>

<p>"Should you?" she laughed. "But," she added with soft
certainty, "you don't understand."</p>

<p>"No--I don't. I suppose it's love; your sort, which is beyond
me. I shall never be blindly in love, shall I?"</p>

<p>"I begin to think you never will," she answered, not very
sadly. "You won't be blindly anything."</p>

<p>"The voice of love!" he laughed; and then: "No, if you pull
your flowers to pieces, and find how they pollinate, and where
are the ovaries, you don't go in blind ecstasies over to them.
But they mean more to you; they are intimate, like friends of
your heart, not like wonderful, dazing fairies."</p>

<p>"Ay!" she assented, musing over it with the gladness of
understanding him. "And then?"</p>

<p>Softly, almost without words, she urged him to the point.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you think I'm a wonderful, magical person,
don't you?--and I'm not--I'm not as good, in the long run, as
your Tom, who thinks you are a wonderful, magical person."</p>

<p>She laughed and clung to him as they walked. He continued,
very carefully and gently: "Now, I don't imagine for a moment
that you are princessy or angelic or wonderful. You often make me
thundering mad because you're an ass . . ."</p>

<p>She laughed low with shame and humiliation.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless--I come from the south to you--because--well,
with you I can be just as I feel, conceited or idiotic, without
being afraid to be myself . . ." He broke off suddenly. "I don't
think I've tried to make myself out to you--any bigger or better
than I am?" he asked her wistfully.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, in beautiful, deep assurance. "No! That's
where it is. You have always been so honest. You are more honest
than anybody ever--" She did not finish, being deeply moved. He
was silent for some time, then he continued, as if he must see
the question to the end with her:</p>

<p>"But, you know--I do like you not to wear corsets. I like to
see you move inside your dress."</p>

<p>She laughed, half shame, half pleasure.</p>

<p>"I wondered if you'd notice," she said.</p>

<p>"I did--directly." There was a space of silence, after which
he resumed: "You see--we would marry tomorrow--but I can't keep
myself. I am in debt--"</p>

<p>She came close to him, and took his arm.</p>

<p>"--And what's the good of letting the years go, and the beauty
of one's youth--?"</p>

<p>"No," she admitted, very slowly and softly, shaking her
head.</p>

<p>"So--well!--you understand, don't you? And if you're
willing--you'll come to me, won't you?--just naturally, as you
used to come and go to church with me?--and it won't be--it won't
be me coaxing you--reluctant? Will it?"</p>

<p>They had halted in front of a stile which they would have to
climb. She turned to him in silence, and put up her face to him.
He took her in his arms, and kissed her, and felt the night mist
with which his moustache was drenched, and he bent his head and
rubbed his face on her shoulder, and then pressed his lips on her
neck. For a while they stood in silence, clasped together. Then
he heard her voice, muffled in his shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>"But--but, you know--it's much harder for the woman--it means
something so different for a woman."</p>

<p>"One can be wise," he answered, slowly and gently. "One need
not blunder into calamities."</p>

<p>She was silent for a time. Then she spoke again.</p>

<p>"Yes, but--if it should be--you see--I couldn't bear it."</p>

<p>He let her go, and they drew apart, and the embrace no longer
choked them from speaking. He recognised the woman defensive,
playing the coward against her own inclinations, and even against
her knowledge.</p>

<p>"If--if!" he exclaimed sharply, so that she shrank with a
little fear. "There need be no ifs--need there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied, reproachfully, very quietly.</p>

<p>"If I say so--" he said, angry with her mistrust. Then he
climbed the stile, and she followed.</p>

<p>"But you <i>do</i> know," he exclaimed. "I have given you
books--"</p>

<p>"Yes, but--"</p>

<p>"But what?" He was getting really angry.</p>

<p>"It's so different for a woman--you don't know."</p>

<p>He did not answer this. They stumbled together over the
mole-hills, under the oak trees.</p>

<p>"And look--how we should have to be--creeping together in the
dark--"</p>

<p>This stung him; at once, it was as if the glamour went out of
life. It was as if she had tipped over the fine vessel that held
the wine of his desire, and had emptied him of all his vitality.
He had played a difficult, deeply-moving part all night, and now
the lights suddenly switched out, and there was left only
weariness. He was silent, tired, very tired, bodily and
spiritually. They walked across the wide, dark meadow with sunken
heads. Suddenly she caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Don't be cold with me!" she cried.</p>

<p>He bent and kissed in acknowledgment the lips she offered him
for love.</p>

<p>"No," he said drearily; "no, it is not coldness--only--I have
lost hold--for to-night." He spoke with difficulty. It was hard
to find a word to say. They stood together, apart, under the old
thorn tree for some minutes, neither speaking. Then he climbed
the fence, and stood on the highway above the meadow.</p>

<p>At parting also he had not kissed her. He stood a moment and
looked at her. The water in a little brook under the hedge was
running, chuckling with extraordinary loudness: away on
Nethermere they heard the sad, haunting cry of the wild-fowl from
the North. The stars still twinkled intensely. He was too spent
to think of anything to say; she was too overcome with grief and
fear and a little resentment. He looked down at the pale blotch
of her face upturned from the low meadow beyond the fence. The
thorn boughs tangled above her, drooping behind her like the roof
of a hut. Beyond was the great width of the darkness. He felt
unable to gather his energy to say anything vital.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said. "I'm going back--on Saturday. But--you'll
write to me. Good-bye."</p>

<p>He turned to go. He saw her white uplifted face vanish, and
her dark form bend under the boughs of the tree, and go out into
the great darkness. She did not say good-bye.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s02">HER TURN</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>She was his second wife, and so there was between them that
truce which is never held between a man and his first woman.</p>

<p>He was one for the women, and as such, an exception among the
colliers. In spite of their prudery, the neighbour women liked
him; he was big, na&iuml;ve, and very courteous with them; he was
so, even to his second wife.</p>

<p>Being a large man of considerable strength and perfect health,
he earned good money in the pit. His natural courtesy saved him
from enemies, while his fresh interest in life made his presence
always agreeable. So he went his own way, had always plenty of
friends, always a good job down pit.</p>

<p>He gave his wife thirty-five shillings a week. He had two
grown-up sons at home, and they paid twelve shillings each. There
was only one child by the second marriage, so Radford considered
his wife did well.</p>

<p>Eighteen months ago, Bryan and Wentworth's men were out on
strike for eleven weeks. During that time, Mrs. Radford could
neither cajole nor entreat nor nag the ten shillings strike-pay
from her husband. So that when the second strike came on, she was
prepared for action.</p>

<p>Radford was going, quite inconspicuously, to the publican's
wife at the "Golden Horn". She is a large, easy-going lady of
forty, and her husband is sixty-three, moreover crippled with
rheumatism. She sits in the little bar-parlour of the wayside
public-house, knitting for dear life, and sipping a very moderate
glass of Scotch. When a decent man arrives at the three-foot
width of bar, she rises, serves him, surveys him over, and, if
she likes his looks, says:</p>

<p>"Won't you step inside, sir?"</p>

<p>If he steps inside, he will find not more than one or two men
present. The room is warm, quite small. The landlady knits. She
gives a few polite words to the stranger, then resumes her
conversation with the man who interests her most. She is
straight, highly-coloured, with indifferent brown eyes.</p>

<p>"What was that you asked me, Mr. Radford?"</p>

<p>"What is the difference between a donkey's tail and a
rainbow?" asked Radford, who had a consuming passion for
conundrums.</p>

<p>"All the difference in the world," replied the landlady.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what special difference?"</p>

<p>"I s'll have to give it up again. You'll think me a donkey's
head, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Not likely. But just you consider now, wheer . . ."</p>

<p>The conundrum was still under weigh, when a girl entered. She
was swarthy, a fine animal. After she had gone out:</p>

<p>"Do you know who that is?" asked the landlady.</p>

<p>"I can't say as I do," replied Radford.</p>

<p>"She's Frederick Pinnock's daughter, from Stony Ford. She's
courting our Willy."</p>

<p>"And a fine lass, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, fine enough, as far as that goes. What sort of a wife'll
she make him, think you?"</p>

<p>"You just let me consider a bit," said the man. He took out a
pocket-book and a pencil. The landlady continued to talk to the
other guests.</p>

<p>Radford was a big fellow, black-haired, with a brown
moustache, and darkish blue eyes. His voice, naturally deep, was
pitched in his throat, and had a peculiar, tenor quality, rather
husky, and disturbing. He modulated it a good deal as he spoke,
as men do who talk much with women. Always, there was a certain
indolence in his carriage.</p>

<p>"Our mester's lazy," his wife said. "There's many a bit of a
jab wants doin', but get him to do it if you can."</p>

<p>But she knew he was merely indifferent to the little jobs, and
not lazy.</p>

<p>He sat writing for about ten minutes, at the end of which
time, he read:</p>

<p>"I see a fine girl full of life.</p>

<p>I see her just ready for wedlock,</p>

<p>But there's jealousy between her eyebrows</p>

<p>And jealousy on her mouth.</p>

<p>I see trouble ahead.</p>

<p>Willy is delicate.</p>

<p>She would do him no good.</p>

<p>She would never see when he wasn't well,</p>

<p>She would only see what she wanted--"</p>

<p>So, in phrases, he got down his thoughts. He had to fumble for
expression, and therefore anything serious he wanted to say he
wrote in "poetry", as he called it.</p>

<p>Presently, the landlady rose, saying:</p>

<p>"Well, I s'll have to be looking after our mester. I s'll be
in again before we close."</p>

<p>Radford sat quite comfortably on. In a while, he too bade the
company good-night.</p>

<p>When he got home, at a quarter-past eleven, his sons were in
bed, and his wife sat awaiting him. She was a woman of medium
height, fat and sleek, a dumpling. Her black hair was parted
smooth, her narrow-opened eyes were sly and satirical, she had a
peculiar twang in her rather sleering voice.</p>

<p>"Our missis is a puss-puss," he said easily, of her. Her
extraordinarily smooth, sleek face was remarkable. She was very
healthy.</p>

<p>He never came in drunk. Having taken off his coat and his cap,
he sat down to supper in his shirt-sleeves. Do as he might, she
was fascinated by him. He had a strong neck, with the crisp hair
growing low. Let her be angry as she would yet she had a passion
for that neck of his, particularly when she saw the great vein
rib under the skin.</p>

<p>"I think, missis," he said, "I'd rather ha'e a smite o' cheese
than this meat."</p>

<p>"Well, can't you get it yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yi, surely I can," he said, and went out to the pantry.</p>

<p>"I think, if yer comin' in at this time of night, you can wait
on yourself," she justified herself.</p>

<p>She moved uneasily in her chair. There were several jam-tarts
alongside the cheese on the dish he brought.</p>

<p>"Yi, Missis, them tan-tafflins'll go down very nicely," he
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, will they! Then you'd better help to pay for them," she
said, amiably, but determined.</p>

<p>"Now what art after?"</p>

<p>"What am I after? Why, can't you think?" she said
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I'm not for thinkin', missis."</p>

<p>"No, I know you're not. But wheer's my money? You've been paid
the Union to-day. Wheer do I come in?"</p>

<p>"Tha's got money, an' tha mun use it."</p>

<p>"Thank yer. An' 'aven't you none, as well?"</p>

<p>"I hadna, not till we was paid, not a ha'p'ny."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself to say so."</p>

<p>"'Appen so."</p>

<p>"We'll go shares wi' th' Union money," she said. "That's
nothing but what's right."</p>

<p>"We shonna. Tha's got plenty o' money as tha can use."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," she said. "I will do."</p>

<p>She went to bed. It made her feel sharp that she could not get
at him.</p>

<p>The next day, she was just as usual. But at eleven o'clock she
took her purse and went up town. Trade was very slack. Men stood
about in gangs, men were playing marbles everywhere in the
streets. It was a sunny morning. Mrs. Radford went into the
furnisher-and-upholsterer's shop.</p>

<p>"There's a few things," she said to Mr. Allcock, "as I'm
wantin' for the house, and I might as well get them now, while
the men's at home, and can shift me the furniture."</p>

<p>She put her fat purse on to the counter with a click. The man
should know she was not wanting "strap". She bought linoleum for
the kitchen, a new wringer, a breakfast-service, a spring
mattress, and various other things, keeping a mere thirty
shillings, which she tied in a corner of her handkerchief. In her
purse was some loose silver.</p>

<p>Her husband was gardening in a desultory fashion when she got
back home. The daffodils were out. The colts in the field at the
end of the garden were tossing their velvety brown necks.</p>

<p>"Sithee here, missis," called Radford, from the shed which
stood halfway down the path. Two doves in a cage were cooing.</p>

<p>"What have you got?" asked the woman, as she approached. He
held out to her in his big, earthy hand a tortoise. The reptile
was very, very slowly issuing its head again to the warmth.</p>

<p>"He's wakkened up betimes," said Radford.</p>

<p>"He's like th' men, wakened up for a holiday," said the wife.
Radford scratched the little beast's scaly head.</p>

<p>"We pleased to see him out," he said.</p>

<p>They had just finished dinner, when a man knocked at the
door.</p>

<p>"From Allcock's!" he said.</p>

<p>The plump woman took up the clothes-basket containing the
crockery she had bought.</p>

<p>"Whativer hast got theer?" asked her husband.</p>

<p>"We've been wantin' some breakfast-cups for ages, so I went up
town an' got 'em this mornin'," she replied.</p>

<p>He watched her taking out the crockery.</p>

<p>"Hm!" he said. "Tha's been on th' spend, seemly."</p>

<p>Again there was a thud at the door. The man had put down a
roll of linoleum. Mr. Radford went to look at it.</p>

<p>"They come rolling in!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Who's grumbled more than you about the raggy oilcloth of this
kitchen?" said the insidious, cat-like voice of the wife.</p>

<p>"It's all right, it's all right," said Radford.</p>

<p>The carter came up the entry with another roll, which he
deposited with a grunt at the door.</p>

<p>"An' how much do you reckon this lot is?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're all paid for, don't worry," replied the wife.</p>

<p>"Shall yer gi'e me a hand, mester?" asked the carter.</p>

<p>Radford followed him down the entry, in his easy, slouching
way. His wife went after. His waistcoat was hanging loose over
his shirt. She watched his easy movement of well-being as she
followed him, and she laughed to herself.</p>

<p>The carter took hold of one end of the wire mattress, dragged
it forth.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a corker!" said Radford, as he received the
burden.</p>

<p>"Now the mangle!" said the carter.</p>

<p>"What dost reckon tha's been up to, missis?" asked the
husband.</p>

<p>"I said to myself last wash-day, if I had to turn that mangle
again, tha'd ha'e ter wash the clothes thyself."</p>

<p>Radford followed the carter down the entry again. In the
street, women were standing watching, and dozens of men were
lounging round the cart. One officiously helped with the
wringer.</p>

<p>"Gi'e him thrippence," said Mrs. Radford.</p>

<p>"Gi'e him thysen," replied her husband.</p>

<p>"I've no change under half a crown."</p>

<p>Radford tipped the carter, and returned indoors. He surveyed
the array of crockery, linoleum, mattress, mangle, and other
goods crowding the house and the yard.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a winder!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"We stood in need of 'em enough," she replied.</p>

<p>"I hope tha's got plenty more from wheer they came from," he
replied dangerously.</p>

<p>"That's just what I haven't." She opened her purse. "Two
half-crowns, that's every copper I've got i' th' world."</p>

<p>He stood very still as he looked.</p>

<p>"It's right," she said.</p>

<p>There was a certain smug sense of satisfaction about her. A
wave of anger came over him, blinding him. But he waited and
waited. Suddenly his arm leapt up, the fist clenched, and his
eyes blazed at her. She shrank away, pale and frightened. But he
dropped his fist to his side, turned, and went out, muttering. He
went down to the shed that stood in the middle of the garden.
There he picked up the tortoise, and stood with bent head,
rubbing its horny head.</p>

<p>She stood hesitating, watching him. Her heart was heavy, and
yet there was a curious, cat-like look of satisfaction round her
eyes. Then she went indoors and gazed at her new cups,
admiringly.</p>

<p>The next week he handed her his half-sovereign without a
word.</p>

<p>"You'll want some for yourself," she said, and she gave him a
shilling. He accepted it.</p>

<h1><a name="s03">LOVE AMONG THE HAYSTACKS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">I</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The two large fields lay on a hillside facing south. Being
newly cleared of hay, they were golden green, and they shone
almost blindingly in the sunlight. Across the hill, half-way up,
ran a high hedge, that flung its black shadow finely across the
molten glow of the sward. The stack was being built just above
the hedge. It was of great size, massive, but so silvery and
delicately bright in tone that it seemed not to have weight. It
rose dishevelled and radiant among the steady, golden-green glare
of the field. A little farther back was another, finished
stack.</p>

<p>The empty wagon was just passing through the gap in the hedge.
From the far-off corner of the bottom field, where the sward was
still striped grey with winrows, the loaded wagon launched
forward, to climb the hill to the stack. The white dots of the
hay-makers showed distinctly among the hay.</p>

<p>The two brothers were having a moment's rest, waiting for the
load to come up. They stood wiping their brows with their arms,
sighing from the heat and the labour of placing the last load.
The stack they rode was high, lifting them up above the
hedge-tops, and very broad, a great slightly-hollowed vessel into
which the sunlight poured, in which the hot, sweet scent of hay
was suffocating. Small and inefficacious the brothers looked,
half-submerged in the loose, great trough, lifted high up as if
on an altar reared to the sun.</p>

<p>Maurice, the younger brother, was a handsome young fellow of
twenty-one, careless and debonair, and full of vigour. His grey
eyes, as he taunted his brother, were bright and baffled with a
strong emotion. His swarthy face had the same peculiar smile,
expectant and glad and nervous, of a young man roused for the
first time in passion.</p>

<p>"Tha sees," he said, as he leaned on the pommel of his fork,
"tha thowt as tha'd done me one, didna ter?" He smiled as he
spoke, then fell again into his pleasant torment of musing.</p>

<p>"I thought nowt--tha knows so much," retorted Geoffrey, with
the touch of a sneer. His brother had the better of him. Geoffrey
was a very heavy, hulking fellow, a year older than Maurice. His
blue eyes were unsteady, they glanced away quickly; his mouth was
morbidly sensitive. One felt him wince away, through the whole of
his great body. His inflamed self-consciousness was a disease in
him.</p>

<p>"Ah but though, I know tha did," mocked Maurice. "Tha went
slinkin' off"--Geoffrey winced convulsively--"thinking as that
wor the last night as any of us'ud ha'e ter stop here, an' so
tha'd leave me to sleep out, though it wor thy turn--"</p>

<p>He smiled to himself, thinking of the result of Geoffrey's
ruse.</p>

<p>"I didna go slinkin' off neither," retorted Geoffrey, in his
heavy, clumsy manner, wincing at the phrase. "Didna my feyther
send me to fetch some coal--"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, oh yes--we know all about it. But tha sees what tha
missed, my lad."</p>

<p>Maurice, chuckling, threw himself on his back in the bed of
hay. There was absolutely nothing in his world, then, except the
shallow ramparts of the stack, and the blazing sky. He clenched
his fists tight, threw his arms across his face, and braced his
muscles again. He was evidently very much moved, so acutely that
it was hardly pleasant, though he still smiled. Geoffrey,
standing behind him, could just see his red mouth, with the young
moustache like black fur, curling back and showing the teeth in a
smile. The elder brother leaned his chin on the pommel of his
fork, looking out across the country.</p>

<p>Far away was the faint blue heap of Nottingham. Between, the
country lay under a haze of heat, with here and there a flag of
colliery smoke waving. But near at hand, at the foot of the hill,
across the deep-hedged high road, was only the silence of the old
church and the castle farm, among their trees. The large view
only made Geoffrey more sick. He looked away, to the wagons
crossing the field below him, the empty cart like a big insect
moving down hill, the load coming up, rocking like a ship, the
brown head of the horse ducking, the brown knees lifted and
planted strenuously. Geoffrey wished it would be quick.</p>

<p>"Tha didna think--"</p>

<p>Geoffrey started, coiled within himself, and looked down at
the handsome lips moving in speech below the brown arms of his
brother.</p>

<p>"Tha didna think 'er'd be thur wi' me--or tha wouldna ha' left
me to it," Maurice said, ending with a little laugh of excited
memory. Geoffrey flushed with hate, and had an impulse to set his
foot on that moving, taunting mouth, which was there below him.
There was silence for a time, then, in a peculiar tone of
delight, Maurice's voice came again, spelling out the words, as
it were:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"Ich bin klein, mein Herz ist rein,<br>
 Ist niemand d'rin als Christ allein."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Maurice chuckled, then, convulsed at a twinge of recollection,
keen as pain, he twisted over, pressed himself into the hay.</p>

<p>"Can thee say thy prayers in German?" came his muffled
voice.</p>

<p>"I non want," growled Geoffrey.</p>

<p>Maurice chuckled. His face was quite hidden, and in the dark
he was going over again his last night's experiences.</p>

<p>"What about kissing 'er under th' ear, Sonny," he said, in a
curious, uneasy tone. He writhed, still startled and inflamed by
his first contact with love.</p>

<p>Geoffrey's heart swelled within him, and things went dark. He
could not see the landscape.</p>

<p>"An' there's just a nice two-handful of her bosom," came the
low, provocative tones of Maurice, who seemed to be talking to
himself.</p>

<p>The two brothers were both fiercely shy of women, and until
this hay harvest, the whole feminine sex had been represented by
their mother and in presence of any other women they were dumb
louts. Moreover, brought up by a proud mother, a stranger in the
country, they held the common girls as beneath them, because
beneath their mother, who spoke pure English, and was very quiet.
Loud-mouthed and broad-tongued the common girls were. So these
two young men had grown up virgin but tormented.</p>

<p>Now again Maurice had the start of Geoffrey, and the elder
brother was deeply mortified. There was a danger of his sinking
into a morbid state, from sheer lack of living, lack of interest.
The foreign governess at the Vicarage, whose garden lay beside
the top field, had talked to the lads through the hedge, and had
fascinated them. There was a great elder bush, with its broad
creamy flowers crumbling on to the garden path, and into the
field. Geoffrey never smelled elder-flower without starting and
wincing, thinking of the strange foreign voice that had so
startled him as he mowed out with the scythe in the hedge bottom.
A baby had run through the gap, and the Fr&auml;ulein, calling in
German, had come brushing down the flowers in pursuit. She had
started so on seeing a man standing there in the shade, that for
a moment she could not move: and then she had blundered into the
rake which was lying by his side. Geoffrey, forgetting she was a
woman when he saw her pitch forward, had picked her up carefully,
asking: "Have you hurt you?"</p>

<p>Then she had broken into a laugh, and answered in German,
showing him her arms, and knitting her brows. She was nettled
rather badly.</p>

<p>"You want a dock leaf," he said. She frowned in a puzzled
fashion.</p>

<p>"A dock leaf?" she repeated. He had rubbed her arms with the
green leaf.</p>

<p>And now, she had taken to Maurice. She had seemed to prefer
himself at first. Now she had sat with Maurice in the moonlight,
and had let him kiss her. Geoffrey sullenly suffered, making no
fight.</p>

<p>Unconsciously, he was looking at the Vicarage garden. There
she was, in a golden-brown dress. He took off his hat, and held
up his right hand in greeting to her. She, a small, golden
figure, waved her hand negligently from among the potato rows. He
remained, arrested, in the same posture, his hat in his left
hand, his right arm upraised, thinking. He could tell by the
negligence of her greeting that she was waiting for Maurice. What
did she think of himself? Why wouldn't she have him?</p>

<p>Hearing the voice of the wagoner leading the load, Maurice
rose. Geoffrey still stood in the same way, but his face was
sullen, and his upraised hand was slack with brooding. Maurice
faced up-hill. His eyes lit up and he laughed. Geoffrey dropped
his own arm, watching.</p>

<p>"Lad!" chuckled Maurice. "I non knowed 'er wor there." He
waved his hand clumsily. In these matters Geoffrey did better.
The elder brother watched the girl. She ran to the end of the
path, behind the bushes, so that she was screened from the house.
Then she waved her handkerchief wildly. Maurice did not notice
the manoeuvre. There was the cry of a child. The girl's figure
vanished, reappeared holding up a white childish bundle, and came
down the path. There she put down her charge, sped up-hill to a
great ash-tree, climbed quickly to a large horizontal bar that
formed the fence there, and, standing poised, blew kisses with
both her hands, in a foreign fashion that excited the brothers.
Maurice laughed aloud, as he waved his red handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the danger?" shouted a mocking voice from below.
Maurice collapsed, blushing furiously.</p>

<p>"Nowt!" he called.</p>

<p>There was a hearty laugh from below.</p>

<p>The load rode up, sheered with a hiss against the stack, then
sank back again upon the scotches. The brothers ploughed across
the mass of hay, taking the forks. Presently a big, burly man,
red and glistening, climbed to the top of the load. Then he
turned round, scrutinized the hillside from under his shaggy
brows. He caught sight of the girl under the ash-tree.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's who it is," he laughed. "I thought it was some
such bird, but I couldn't see her."</p>

<p>The father laughed in a hearty, chaffing way, then began to
teem the load. Geoffrey, on the stack above, received his great
forkfuls, and swung them over to Maurice, who took them, placed
them, building the stack. In the intense sunlight, the three
worked in silence, knit together in a brief passion of work. The
father stirred slowly for a moment, getting the hay from under
his feet. Geoffrey waited, the blue tines of his fork glittering
in expectation: the mass rose, his fork swung beneath it, there
was a light clash of blades, then the hay was swept on to the
stack, caught by Maurice, who placed it judiciously. One after
another, the shoulders of the three men bowed and braced
themselves. All wore light blue, bleached shirts, that stuck
close to their backs. The father moved mechanically, his thick,
rounded shoulders bending and lifting dully: he worked
monotonously. Geoffrey flung away his strength. His massive
shoulders swept and flung the hay extravagantly.</p>

<p>"Dost want to knock me ower?" asked Maurice angrily. He had to
brace himself against the impact. The three men worked intensely,
as if some will urged them. Maurice was light and swift at the
work, but he had to use his judgement. Also, when he had to place
the hay along the far ends, he had some distance to carry it. So
he was too slow for Geoffrey. Ordinarily, the elder would have
placed the hay as far as possible where his brother wanted it.
Now, however, he pitched his forkfuls into the middle of the
stack. Maurice strode swiftly and handsomely across the bed, but
the work was too much for him. The other two men, clenched in
their receive and deliver, kept up a high pitch of labour.
Geoffrey still flung the hay at random. Maurice was perspiring
heavily with heat and exertion, and was getting worried. Now and
again, Geoffrey wiped his arm across his brow, mechanically, like
an animal. Then he glanced with satisfaction at Maurice's moiled
condition, and caught the next forkful.</p>

<p>"Wheer dost think thou'rt hollin' it, fool!" panted Maurice,
as his brother flung a forkful out of reach.</p>

<p>"Wheer I've a mind," answered Geoffrey.</p>

<p>Maurice toiled on, now very angry. He felt the sweat trickling
down his body: drops fell into his long black lashes, blinding
him, so that he had to stop and angrily dash his eyes clear. The
veins stood out in his swarthy neck. He felt he would burst, or
drop, if the work did not soon slacken off. He heard his father's
fork dully scrape the cart bottom.</p>

<p>"There, the last," the father panted. Geoffrey tossed the last
light lot at random, took off his hat, and, steaming in the
sunshine as he wiped himself, stood complacently watching Maurice
struggle with clearing the bed.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you've got your bottom corner a bit far out?"
came the father's voice from below. "You'd better be drawing in
now, hadn't you?"</p>

<p>"I thought you said next load," Maurice called, sulkily.</p>

<p>"Aye! All right. But isn't this bottom corner--?"</p>

<p>Maurice, impatient, took no notice.</p>

<p>Geoffrey strode over the stack, and stuck his fork in the
offending corner. "What--here?" he bawled in his great voice.</p>

<p>"Aye--isn't it a bit loose?" came the irritating voice.</p>

<p>Geoffrey pushed his fork in the jutting corner, and, leaning
his weight on the handle, shoved. He thought it shook. He thrust
again with all his power. The mass swayed.</p>

<p>"What art up to, tha fool!" cried Maurice, in a high
voice.</p>

<p>"Mind who tha'rt callin' a fool," said Geoffrey, and he
prepared to push again. Maurice sprang across, and elbowed his
brother aside. On the yielding, swaying bed of hay, Geoffrey lost
his foothold, and fell grovelling. Maurice tried the corner.</p>

<p>"It's solid enough," he shouted angrily.</p>

<p>"Aye--all right," came the conciliatory voice of the father;
"you do get a bit of rest now there's such a long way to cart
it," he added reflectively.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had got to his feet.</p>

<p>"Tha'll mind who tha'rt nudging, I can tell thee," he
threatened heavily; adding, as Maurice continued to work, "an'
tha non ca's him a fool again, dost hear?"</p>

<p>"Not till next time," sneered Maurice.</p>

<p>As he worked silently round the stack, he neared where his
brother stood like a sullen statue, leaning on his fork-handle,
looking out over the countryside. Maurice's heart quickened in
its beat. He worked forward, until a point of his fork caught in
the leather of Geoffrey's boot, and the metal rang sharply.</p>

<p>"Are ter going ta shift thysen?" asked Maurice threateningly.
There was no reply from the great block. Maurice lifted his upper
lip like a dog. Then he put out his elbow, and tried to push his
brother into the stack, clear of his way.</p>

<p>"Who are ter shovin'?" came the deep, dangerous voice.</p>

<p>"Tha&iuml;gh," replied Maurice, with a sneer, and straightway
the two brothers set themselves against each other, like opposing
bulls, Maurice trying his hardest to shift Geoffrey from his
footing, Geoffrey leaning all his weight in resistance. Maurice,
insecure in his footing, staggered a little, and Geoffrey's
weight followed him. He went slithering over the edge of the
stack.</p>

<p>Geoffrey turned white to the lips, and remained standing,
listening. He heard the fall. Then a flush of darkness came over
him, and he remained standing only because he was planted. He had
not strength to move. He could hear no sound from below, was only
faintly aware of a sharp shriek from a long way off. He listened
again. Then he filled with sudden panic.</p>

<p>"Feyther!" he roared, in his tremendous voice: "Feyther!
Feyther!"</p>

<p>The valley re-echoed with the sound. Small cattle on the
hill-side looked up. Men's figures came running from the bottom
field, and much nearer a woman's figure was racing across the
upper field. Geoffrey waited in terrible suspense.</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" he heard the strange, wild voice of the girl cry out.
"Ah-h!"--and then some foreign wailing speech. Then: "Ah-h! Are
you dea-ed!"</p>

<p>He stood sullenly erect on the stack, not daring to go down,
longing to hide in the hay, but too sullen to stoop out of sight.
He heard his eldest brother come up, panting:</p>

<p>"Whatever's amiss!" and then the labourer, and then his
father.</p>

<p>"Whatever have you been doing?" he heard his father ask, while
yet he had not come round the corner of the stack. And then, in a
low, bitter tone:</p>

<p>"Eh, he's done for! I'd no business to ha' put it all on that
stack."</p>

<p>There was a moment or two of silence, then the voice of Henry,
the eldest brother, said crisply:</p>

<p>"He's not dead--he's coming round."</p>

<p>Geoffrey heard, but was not glad. He had as lief Maurice were
dead. At least that would be final: better than meeting his
brother's charges, and of seeing his mother pass to the
sick-room. If Maurice was killed, he himself would not explain,
no, not a word, and they could hang him if they liked. If Maurice
were only hurt, then everybody would know, and Geoffrey could
never lift his face again. What added torture, to pass along,
everybody knowing. He wanted something that he could stand back
to, something definite, if it were only the knowledge that he had
killed his brother. He <i>must</i> have something firm to back up
to, or he would go mad. He was so lonely, he who above all needed
the support of sympathy.</p>

<p>"No, he's commin' to; I tell you he is," said the
labourer.</p>

<p>"He's not dea-ed, he's not dea-ed," came the passionate,
strange sing-song of the foreign girl. "He's not dead--no-o."</p>

<p>"He wants some brandy--look at the colour of his lips," said
the crisp, cold voice of Henry. "Can you fetch some?"</p>

<p>"Wha-at? Fetch?" Fr&auml;ulein did not understand.</p>

<p>"Brandy," said Henry, very distinct.</p>

<p>"Brrandy!" she re-echoed.</p>

<p>"You go, Bill," groaned the father.</p>

<p>"Aye, I'll go," replied Bill, and he ran across the field.</p>

<p>Maurice was not dead, nor going to die. This Geoffrey now
realized. He was glad after all that the extreme penalty was
revoked. But he hated to think of himself going on. He would
always shrink now. He had hoped and hoped for the time when he
would be careless, bold as Maurice, when he would not wince and
shrink. Now he would always be the same, coiling up in himself
like a tortoise with no shell.</p>

<p>"Ah-h! He's getting better!" came the wild voice of the
Fr&auml;ulein, and she began to cry, a strange sound, that
startled the men, made the animal bristle within them. Geoffrey
shuddered as he heard, between her sobbing, the impatient moaning
of his brother as the breath came back.</p>

<p>The labourer returned at a run, followed by the Vicar. After
the brandy, Maurice made more moaning, hiccuping noise. Geoffrey
listened in torture. He heard the Vicar asking for explanations.
All the united, anxious voices replied in brief phrases.</p>

<p>"It was that other," cried the Fr&auml;ulein. "He knocked him
over--Ha!"</p>

<p>She was shrill and vindictive.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said the father to the Vicar, in a quite
audible but private tone, speaking as if the Fr&auml;ulein did
not understand his English.</p>

<p>The Vicar addressed his children's governess in bad German.
She replied in a torrent which he would not confess was too much
for him. Maurice was making little moaning, sighing noises.</p>

<p>"Where's your pain, boy, eh?" the father asked,
pathetically.</p>

<p>"Leave him alone a bit," came the cool voice of Henry. "He's
winded, if no more."</p>

<p>"You'd better see that no bones are broken," said the anxious
Vicar.</p>

<p>"It wor a blessing as he should a dropped on that heap of hay
just there," said the labourer. "If he'd happened to ha' catched
hisself on this nog o' wood 'e wouldna ha' stood much
chance."</p>

<p>Geoffrey wondered when he would have courage to venture down.
He had wild notions of pitching himself head foremost from the
stack: if he could only extinguish himself, he would be safe.
Quite frantically, he longed not to be. The idea of going through
life thus coiled up within himself in morbid self-consciousness,
always lonely, surly, and a misery, was enough to make him cry
out. What would they all think when they knew he had knocked
Maurice off that high stack?</p>

<p>They were talking to Maurice down below. The lad had recovered
in great measure, and was able to answer faintly.</p>

<p>"Whatever was you doin'?" the father asked gently. "Was you
playing about with our Geoffrey?--Aye, and where is he?"</p>

<p>Geoffrey's heart stood still.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Henry, in a curious, ironic tone.</p>

<p>"Go an' have a look," pleaded the father, infinitely relieved
over one son, anxious now concerning the other. Geoffrey could
not bear that his eldest brother should climb up and question him
in his high-pitched drawl of curiosity. The culprit doggedly set
his feet on the ladder. His nailed boots slipped a rung.</p>

<p>"Mind yourself," shouted the overwrought father.</p>

<p>Geoffrey stood like a criminal at the foot of the ladder,
glancing furtively at the group. Maurice was lying, pale and
slightly convulsed, upon a heap of hay. The Fr&auml;ulein was
kneeling beside his head. The Vicar had the lad's shirt full open
down the breast, and was feeling for broken ribs. The father
kneeled on the other side, the labourer and Henry stood
aside.</p>

<p>"I can't find anything broken," said the Vicar, and he sounded
slightly disappointed.</p>

<p>"There's nowt broken to find," murmured Maurice, smiling.</p>

<p>The father started. "Eh?" he said. "Eh?" and he bent over the
invalid.</p>

<p>"I say it's not hurt me," repeated Maurice.</p>

<p>"What were you doing?" asked the cold, ironic voice of Henry.
Geoffrey turned his head away: he had not yet raised his
face.</p>

<p>"Nowt as I know on," he muttered in a surly tone.</p>

<p>"Why!" cried Fr&auml;ulein in a reproachful tone. "I see
him--knock him over!" She made a fierce gesture with her elbow.
Henry curled his long moustache sardonically.</p>

<p>"Nay lass, niver," smiled the wan Maurice. "He was fur enough
away from me when I slipped."</p>

<p>"Oh, ah!" cried the Fr&auml;ulein, not understanding.</p>

<p>"Yi," smiled Maurice indulgently.</p>

<p>"I think you're mistaken," said the father, rather
pathetically, smiling at the girl as if she were "wanting".</p>

<p>"Oh no," she cried. "I <i>see</i> him."</p>

<p>"Nay, lass," smiled Maurice quietly.</p>

<p>She was a Pole, named Paula Jablonowsky: young, only twenty
years old, swift and light as a wild cat, with a strange,
wild-cat way of grinning. Her hair was blonde and full of life,
all crisped into many tendrils with vitality, shaking round her
face. Her fine blue eyes were peculiarly lidded, and she seemed
to look piercingly, then languorously, like a wild cat. She had
somewhat Slavonic cheekbones, and was very much freckled. It was
evident that the Vicar, a pale, rather cold man, hated her.</p>

<p>Maurice lay pale and smiling in her lap, whilst she cleaved to
him like a mate. One felt instinctively that they were mated. She
was ready at any minute to fight with ferocity in his defence,
now he was hurt. Her looks at Geoffrey were full of fierceness.
She bowed over Maurice and caressed him with her foreign-sounding
English.</p>

<p>"You say what you lai-ike," she laughed, giving him lordship
over her.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better be going and looking what has become of
Margery?" asked the Vicar in tones of reprimand.</p>

<p>"She is with her mother--I heared her. I will go in a
whai-ile," smiled the girl, coolly.</p>

<p>"Do you feel as if you could stand?" asked the father, still
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Aye, in a bit," smiled Maurice.</p>

<p>"You want to get up?" caressed the girl, bowing over him, till
her face was not far from his.</p>

<p>"I'm in no hurry," he replied, smiling brilliantly.</p>

<p>This accident had given him quite a strange new ease, an
authority. He felt extraordinarily glad. New power had come to
him all at once.</p>

<p>"You in no hurry," she repeated, gathering his meaning. She
smiled tenderly: she was in his service.</p>

<p>"She leaves us in another month--Mrs Inwood could stand no
more of her," apologized the Vicar quietly to the father.</p>

<p>"Why, is she--?"</p>

<p>"Like a wild thing--disobedient, and insolent."</p>

<p>"Ha!"</p>

<p>The father sounded abstract.</p>

<p>"No more foreign governesses for me."</p>

<p>Maurice stirred, and looked up at the girl.</p>

<p>"You stand up?" she asked brightly. "You well?"</p>

<p>He laughed again, showing his teeth winsomely. She lifted his
head, sprung to her feet, her hands still holding his head, then
she took him under the armpits and had him on his feet before
anyone could help. He was much taller than she. He grasped her
strong shoulders heavily, leaned against her, and, feeling her
round, firm breast doubled up against his side, he smiled,
catching his breath.</p>

<p>"You see I'm all right," he gasped. "I was only winded."</p>

<p>"You all ra&iuml;ght?" she cried, in great glee.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am."</p>

<p>He walked a few steps after a moment.</p>

<p>"There's nowt ails me, Father," he laughed.</p>

<p>"Quite well, you?" she cried in a pleading tone. He laughed
outright, looked down at her, touching her cheek with his
fingers.</p>

<p>"That's it--if tha likes."</p>

<p>"If I lai-ike!" she repeated, radiant.</p>

<p>"She's going at the end of three weeks," said the Vicar
consolingly to the farmer.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">II</p>

<p> </p>

<p>While they were talking, they heard the far-off hooting of a
pit.</p>

<p>"There goes th' loose a'," said Henry, coldly. "We're
<i>not</i> going to get that corner up to-day."</p>

<p>The father looked round anxiously.</p>

<p>"Now, Maurice, are you sure you're all right?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm all right. Haven't I told you?"</p>

<p>"Then you sit down there, and in a bit you can be getting
dinner out. Henry, you go on the stack. Wheer's Jim? Oh, he's
minding the hosses. Bill, and you, Geoffrey, you can pick while
Jim loads."</p>

<p>Maurice sat down under the wych elm to recover. The
Fr&auml;ulein had fled back. He made up his mind to ask her to
marry him. He had got fifty pounds of his own, and his mother
would help him. For a long time he sat musing, thinking what he
would do. Then, from the float he fetched a big basket covered
with a cloth, and spread the dinner. There was an immense rabbit
pie, a dish of cold potatoes, much bread, a great piece of
cheese, and a solid rice pudding.</p>

<p>These two fields were four miles from the home farm. But they
had been in the hands of the Wookeys for several generations,
therefore the father kept them on, and everyone looked forward to
the hay harvest at Greasley: it was a kind of picnic. They
brought dinner and tea in the milk-float, which the father drove
over in the morning. The lads and the labourers cycled. Off and
on, the harvest lasted a fortnight. As the high road from
Alfreton to Nottingham ran at the foot of the fields, someone
usually slept in the hay under the shed to guard the tools. The
sons took it in turns. They did not care for it much, and were
for that reason anxious to finish the harvest on this day. But
work went slack and disjointed after Maurice's accident.</p>

<p>When the load was teemed, they gathered round the white cloth,
which was spread under a tree between the hedge and the stack,
and, sitting on the ground, ate their meal. Mrs Wookey sent
always a clean cloth, and knives and forks and plates for
everybody. Mr Wookey was always rather proud of this spread:
everything was so proper.</p>

<p>"There now," he said, sitting down jovially. "Doesn't this
look nice now--eh?"</p>

<p>They all sat round the white spread, in the shadow of the tree
and the stack, and looked out up the fields as they ate. From
their shady coolness, the gold sward seemed liquid, molten with
heat. The horse with the empty wagon wandered a few yards, then
stood feeding. Everything was still as a trance. Now and again,
the horse between the shafts of the load that stood propped
beside the stack, jingled his loose bit as he ate. The men ate
and drank in silence, the father reading the newspaper, Maurice
leaning back on a saddle, Henry reading the <i>Nation,</i> the
others eating busily.</p>

<p>Presently "Helloa! 'Er's 'ere again!" exclaimed Bill. All
looked up. Paula was coming across the field carrying a
plate.</p>

<p>"She's bringing something to tempt your appetite, Maurice,"
said the eldest brother ironically. Maurice was midway through a
large wedge of rabbit pie, and some cold potatoes.</p>

<p>"Aye, bless me if she's not," laughed the father. "Put that
away, Maurice, it's a shame to disappoint her."</p>

<p>Maurice looked round very shamefaced, not knowing what to do
with his plate.</p>

<p>"Give it over here," said Bill. "I'll polish him off."</p>

<p>"Bringing something for the invalid?" laughed the father to
the Fr&auml;ulein. "He's looking up nicely."</p>

<p>"I bring him some chicken, him!" She nodded her head at
Maurice childishly. He flushed and smiled.</p>

<p>"Tha doesna mean ter bust 'im," said Bill.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed aloud. The girl did not understand, so she
laughed also. Maurice ate his portion very sheepishly.</p>

<p>The father pitied his son's shyness.</p>

<p>"Come here and sit by me," he said. "Eh, Fr&auml;ulein! Is
that what they call you?"</p>

<p>"I sit by you, Father," she said innocently.</p>

<p>Henry threw his head back and laughed long and
noiselessly.</p>

<p>She settled near to the big, handsome man.</p>

<p>"My name," she said, "is Paula Jablonowsky."</p>

<p>"Is what?" said the father, and the other men went into roars
of laughter.</p>

<p>"Tell me again," said the father. "Your name--?"</p>

<p>"Paula."</p>

<p>"Paula? Oh--well, it's a rum sort of name, eh? His name--" he
nodded at his son.</p>

<p>"Maurice--I know." She pronounced it sweetly, then laughed
into the father's eyes. Maurice blushed to the roots of his
hair.</p>

<p>They questioned her concerning her history, and made out that
she came from Hanover, that her father was a shop-keeper, and
that she had run away from home because she did not like her
father. She had gone to Paris.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the father, now dubious. "And what did you do
there?"</p>

<p>"In school--in a young ladies' school."</p>

<p>"Did you like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh no--no la&iuml;fe--no life!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"When we go out--two and two--all together--no more. Ah, no
life, no life."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a winder!" exclaimed the father. "No life in
Paris! And have you found much life in England?"</p>

<p>"No--ah no. I don't like it." She made a grimace at the
Vicarage.</p>

<p>"How long have you been in England?"</p>

<p>"Chreestmas--so."</p>

<p>"And what will you do?"</p>

<p>"I will go to London, or to Paris. Ah, Paris!--Or get
married!" She laughed into the father's eyes.</p>

<p>The father laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Get married, eh? And who to?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I am going away."</p>

<p>"The country's too quiet for you?" asked the father.</p>

<p>"Too quiet--hm!" she nodded in assent.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't care for making butter and cheese?"</p>

<p>"Making butter--hm!" She turned to him with a glad, bright
gesture. "I like it."</p>

<p>"Oh," laughed the father. "You would, would you?"</p>

<p>She nodded vehemently, with glowing eyes.</p>

<p>"She'd like anything in the shape of a change," said Henry
judicially.</p>

<p>"I think she would," agreed the father. It did not occur to
them that she fully understood what they said. She looked at them
closely, then thought with bowed head.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" exclaimed Henry, the alert. A tramp was slouching
towards them through the gap. He was a very seedy, slinking
fellow, with a tang of horsey braggadocio about him. Small, thin,
and ferrety, with a week's red beard bristling on his pointed
chin, he came slouching forward.</p>

<p>"Have yer got a bit of a job goin'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A bit of a job," repeated the father. "Why, can't you see as
we've a'most done?"</p>

<p>"Aye--but I noticed you was a hand short, an' I thowt as
'appen you'd gie me half a day."</p>

<p>"What, are <i>you</i> any good in a hay close?" asked Henry,
with a sneer.</p>

<p>The man stood slouching against the haystack. All the others
were seated on the floor. He had an advantage.</p>

<p>"I could work aside any on yer," he bragged.</p>

<p>"Tha looks it," laughed Bill.</p>

<p>"And what's your regular trade?" asked the father.</p>

<p>"I'm a jockey by rights. But I did a bit o' dirty work for a
boss o' mine, an' I was landed. "<i>E</i> got the benefit,
<i>I</i> got kicked out. "<i>E</i> axed me--an' then 'e looked as
if 'e'd never seed me."</p>

<p>"Did he, though!" exclaimed the father sympathetically.</p>

<p>"'E did that!" asserted the man.</p>

<p>"But we've got nothing for you," said Henry coldly.</p>

<p>"What does the boss say?" asked the man, impudent.</p>

<p>"No, we've no work you can do," said the father. "You can have
a bit o' something to eat, if you like."</p>

<p>"I should be glad of it," said the man.</p>

<p>He was given the chunk of rabbit pie that remained. This he
ate greedily. There was something debased, parasitic, about him,
which disgusted Henry. The others regarded him as a
curiosity.</p>

<p>"That was nice and tasty," said the tramp, with gusto.</p>

<p>"Do you want a piece of bread 'n' cheese?" asked the
father.</p>

<p>"It'll help to fill up," was the reply.</p>

<p>The man ate this more slowly. The company was embarrassed by
his presence, and could not talk. All the men lit their pipes,
the meal over.</p>

<p>"So you dunna want any help?" said the tramp at last.</p>

<p>"No--we can manage what bit there is to do."</p>

<p>"You don't happen to have a fill of bacca to spare, do
you?"</p>

<p>The father gave him a good pinch.</p>

<p>"You're all right here," he said, looking round. They resented
this familiarity. However, he filled his clay pipe and smoked
with the rest.</p>

<p>As they were sitting silent, another figure came through the
gap in the hedge, and noiselessly approached. It was a woman. She
was rather small and finely made. Her face was small, very ruddy,
and comely, save for the look of bitterness and aloofness that it
wore. Her hair was drawn tightly back under a sailor hat. She
gave an impression of cleanness, of precision and directness.</p>

<p>"Have you got some work?" she asked of her man. She ignored
the rest. He tucked his tail between his legs.</p>

<p>"No, they haven't got no work for me. They've just gave me a
draw of bacca."</p>

<p>He was a mean crawl of a man.</p>

<p>"An' am I goin' to wait for you out there on the lane all
day?"</p>

<p>"You needn't if you don't like. You could go on."</p>

<p>"Well, are you coming?" she asked contemptuously. He rose to
his feet in a rickety fashion.</p>

<p>"You needn't be in such a mighty hurry," he said. "If you'd
wait a bit you might get summat."</p>

<p>She glanced for the first time over the men. She was quite
young, and would have been pretty, were she not so hard and
callous-looking.</p>

<p>"Have you had your dinner?" asked the father.</p>

<p>She looked at him with a kind of anger, and turned away. Her
face was so childish in its contours, contrasting strangely with
her expression.</p>

<p>"Are you coming?" she said to the man.</p>

<p>"He's had his tuck-in. Have a bit, if you want it," coaxed the
father.</p>

<p>"What have you had?" she flashed to the man.</p>

<p>"He's had all what was left o' th' rabbit pie," said Geoffrey,
in an indignant, mocking tone, "and a great hunk o' bread an'
cheese."</p>

<p>"Well, it was gave me," said the man.</p>

<p>The young woman looked at Geoffrey, and he at her. There was a
sort of kinship between them. Both were at odds with the world.
Geoffrey smiled satirically. She was too grave, too deeply
incensed even to smile.</p>

<p>"There's a cake here, though--you can have a bit o' that,"
said Maurice blithely.</p>

<p>She eyed him with scorn.</p>

<p>Again she looked at Geoffrey. He seemed to understand her. She
turned, and in silence departed. The man remained obstinately
sucking at his pipe. Everybody looked at him with hostility.</p>

<p>"We'll be getting to work," said Henry, rising, pulling off
his coat. Paula got to her feet. She was a little bit confused by
the presence of the tramp.</p>

<p>"I go," she said, smiling brilliantly. Maurice rose and
followed her sheepishly.</p>

<p>"A good grind, eh?" said the tramp, nodding after the
Fr&auml;ulein. The men only half-understood him, but they hated
him.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better be getting off?" said Henry.</p>

<p>The man rose obediently. He was all slouching, parasitic
insolence. Geoffrey loathed him, longed to exterminate him. He
was exactly the worst foe of the hyper-sensitive: insolence
without sensibility, preying on sensibility.</p>

<p>"Aren't you goin' to give me summat for her? It's nowt she's
had all day, to my knowin'. She'll 'appen eat it if I take it
'er--though she gets more than I've any knowledge of"--this with
a lewd wink of jealous spite. "And then tries to keep a tight
hand on me," he sneered, taking the bread and cheese, and
stuffing it in his pocket.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">III</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Geoffrey worked sullenly all the afternoon, and Maurice did
the horse-raking. It was exceedingly hot. So the day wore on, the
atmosphere thickened, and the sunlight grew blurred. Geoffrey was
picking with Bill--helping to load the wagons from the winrows.
He was sulky, though extraordinarily relieved: Maurice would not
tell. Since the quarrel neither brother had spoken to the other.
But their silence was entirely amicable, almost affectionate.
They had both been deeply moved, so much so that their ordinary
intercourse was interrupted: but underneath, each felt a strong
regard for the other. Maurice was peculiarly happy, his feeling
of affection swimming over everything. But Geoffrey was still
sullenly hostile to the most part of the world. He felt isolated.
The free and easy intercommunication between the other workers
left him distinctly alone. And he was a man who could not bear to
stand alone, he was too much afraid of the vast confusion of life
surrounding him, in which he was helpless. Geoffrey mistrusted
himself with everybody.</p>

<p>The work went on slowly. It was unbearably hot, and everyone
was disheartened.</p>

<p>"We s'll have getting-on-for another day of it," said the
father at tea-time, as they sat under the tree.</p>

<p>"Quite a day," said Henry.</p>

<p>"Somebody'll have to stop, then," said Geoffrey. "It 'ud
better be me."</p>

<p>"Nay, lad, I'll stop," said Maurice, and he hid his head in
confusion.</p>

<p>"Stop again to-night!" exclaimed the father. "I'd rather you
went home."</p>

<p>"Nay, I'm stoppin'," protested Maurice.</p>

<p>"He wants to do his courting," Henry enlightened them.</p>

<p>The father thought seriously about it.</p>

<p>"I don't know . . ." he mused, rather perturbed.</p>

<p>But Maurice stayed. Towards eight o'clock, after sundown, the
men mounted their bicycles, the father put the horse in the
float, and all departed. Maurice stood in the gap of the hedge
and watched them go, the cart rolling and swinging downhill, over
the grass stubble, the cyclists dipping swiftly like shadows in
front. All passed through the gate, there was a quick clatter of
hoofs on the roadway under the lime trees, and they were gone.
The young man was very much excited, almost afraid, at finding
himself alone.</p>

<p>Darkness was rising from the valley. Already, up the steep
hill the cart-lamps crept indecisively, and the cottage windows
were lit. Everything looked strange to Maurice, as if he had not
seen it before. Down the hedge a large lime-tree teemed with
scent that seemed almost like a voice speaking. It startled him.
He caught a breath of the over-sweet fragrance, then stood still,
listening expectantly.</p>

<p>Up hill, a horse whinneyed. It was the young mare. The heavy
horses went thundering across to the far hedge.</p>

<p>Maurice wondered what to do. He wandered round the deserted
stacks restlessly. Heat came in wafts, in thick strands. The
evening was a long time cooling. He thought he would go and wash
himself. There was a trough of pure water in the hedge bottom. It
was filled by a tiny spring that filtered over the brim of the
trough down the lush hedge bottom of the lower field. All round
the trough, in the upper field, the land was marshy, and there
the meadow-sweet stood like clots of mist, very sickly-smelling
in the twilight. The night did not darken, for the moon was in
the sky, so that as the tawny colour drew off the heavens they
remained pallid with a dimmed moon. The purple bell-flowers in
the hedge went black, the ragged robin turned its pink to a faded
white, the meadow-sweet gathered light as if it were
phosphorescent, and it made the air ache with scent.</p>

<p>Maurice kneeled on the slab of stone bathing his hands and
arms, then his face. The water was deliriously cool. He had still
an hour before Paula would come: she was not due till nine. So he
decided to take his bath at night instead of waiting till
morning. Was he not sticky, and was not Paula coming to talk to
him? He was delighted the thought had occurred to him. As he
soused his head in the trough, he wondered what the little
creatures that lived in the velvety silt at the bottom would
think of the taste of soap. Laughing to himself, he squeezed his
cloth into the water. He washed himself from head to foot,
standing in the fresh, forsaken corner of the field, where no one
could see him by daylight, so that now, in the veiled grey tinge
of moonlight, he was no more noticeable than the crowded flowers.
The night had on a new look: he never remembered to have seen the
lustrous grey sheen of it before, nor to have noticed how vital
the lights looked, like live folk inhabiting the silvery spaces.
And the tall trees, wrapped obscurely in their mantles, would not
have surprised him had they begun to move in converse. As he
dried himself, he discovered little wanderings in the air, felt
on his sides soft touches and caresses that were peculiarly
delicious: sometimes they startled him, and he laughed as if he
were not alone. The flowers, the meadow-sweet particularly,
haunted him. He reached to put his hand over their fleeciness.
They touched his thighs. Laughing, he gathered them and dusted
himself all over with their cream dust and fragrance. For a
moment he hesitated in wonder at himself: but the subtle glow in
the hoary and black night reassured him. Things never had looked
so personal and full of beauty, he had never known the wonder in
himself before.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he was waiting under the elder-bush, in a
state of high trepidation, but feeling that he was worthy, having
a sense of his own wonder. She was late. At a quarter-past nine
she came, flitting swiftly, in her own eager way.</p>

<p>"No, she would <i>not</i> go to sleep," said Paula, with a
world of wrath in her tone. He laughed bashfully. They wandered
out into the dim, hillside field.</p>

<p>"I have sat--in that bedroom--for an hour, for hours," she
cried indignantly. She took a deep breath: "Ah, breathe!" she
smiled.</p>

<p>She was very intense, and full of energy.</p>

<p>"I want"--she was clumsy with the language--"I want--I should
laike--to run--there!" She pointed across the field.</p>

<p>"Let's run, then," he said, curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>And in an instant she was gone. He raced after her. For all he
was so young and limber, he had difficulty in catching her. At
first he could scarcely see her, though he could hear the rustle
of her dress. She sped with astonishing fleetness. He overtook
her, caught her by the arm, and they stood panting, facing one
another with laughter.</p>

<p>"I could win," she asserted blithely.</p>

<p>"Tha couldna," he replied, with a peculiar, excited laugh.
They walked on, rather breathless. In front of them suddenly
appeared the dark shapes of the three feeding horses.</p>

<p>"We ride a horse?" she said.</p>

<p>"What, bareback?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You say?" She did not understand.</p>

<p>"With no saddle?"</p>

<p>"No saddle--yes--no saddle."</p>

<p>"Coop, lass!" he said to the mare, and in a minute he had her
by the forelock, and was leading her down to the stacks, where he
put a halter on her. She was a big, strong mare. Maurice seated
the Fr&auml;ulein, clambered himself in front of the girl, using
the wheel of the wagon as a mount, and together they trotted
uphill, she holding lightly round his waist. From the crest of
the hill they looked round.</p>

<p>The sky was darkening with an awning of cloud. On the left the
hill rose black and wooded, made cosy by a few lights from
cottages along the highway. The hill spread to the right, and
tufts of trees shut round. But in front was a great vista of
night, a sprinkle of cottage candles, a twinkling cluster of
lights, like an elfish fair in full swing, at the colliery, an
encampment of light at a village, a red flare on the sky far off,
above an iron-foundry, and in the farthest distance the dim
breathing of town lights. As they watched the night stretch far
out, her arms tightened round his waist, and he pressed his
elbows to his side, pressing her arms closer still. The horse
moved restlessly. They clung to each other.</p>

<p>"Tha doesna want to go right away?" he asked the girl behind
him.</p>

<p>"I stay with you," she answered softly, and he felt her
crouching close against him. He laughed curiously. He was afraid
to kiss her, though he was urged to do so. They remained still,
on the restless horse, watching the small lights lead deep into
the night, an infinite distance.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go," he said, in a tone half pleading.</p>

<p>She did not answer. The horse stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>"Let him run," cried Paula, "fast!"</p>

<p>She broke the spell, startled him into a little fury. He
kicked the mare, hit her, and away she plunged downhill. The girl
clung tightly to the young man. They were riding bareback down a
rough, steep hill. Maurice clung hard with hands and knees. Paula
held him fast round the waist, leaning her head on his shoulders,
and thrilling with excitement.</p>

<p>"We shall be off, we shall be off," he cried, laughing with
excitement; but she only crouched behind and pressed tight to
him. The mare tore across the field. Maurice expected every
moment to be flung on to the grass. He gripped with all the
strength of his knees. Paula tucked herself behind him, and often
wrenched him almost from his hold. Man and girl were taut with
effort.</p>

<p>At last the mare came to a standstill, blowing. Paula slid
off, and in an instant Maurice was beside her. They were both
highly excited. Before he knew what he was doing, he had her in
his arms, fast, and was kissing her, and laughing. They did not
move for some time. Then, in silence, they walked towards the
stacks.</p>

<p>It had grown quite dark, the night was thick with cloud. He
walked with his arm round Paula's waist, she with her arm round
him. They were near the stacks when Maurice felt a spot of
rain.</p>

<p>"It's going to rain," he said.</p>

<p>"Rain!" she echoed, as if it were trivial.</p>

<p>"I s'll have to put the stack-cloth on," he said gravely. She
did not understand.</p>

<p>When they got to the stacks, he went round to the shed, to
return staggering in the darkness under the burden of the immense
and heavy cloth. It had not been used once during the hay
harvest.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Paula, coming close to him
in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Cover the top of the stack with it," he replied. "Put it over
the stack, to keep the rain out."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried, "up there!" He dropped his burden. "Yes," he
answered.</p>

<p>Fumblingly he reared the long ladder up the side of the stack.
He could not see the top.</p>

<p>"I hope it's solid," he said, softly.</p>

<p>A few smart drops of rain sounded drumming on the cloth. They
seemed like another presence. It was very dark indeed between the
great buildings of hay. She looked up the black wall, and shrank
to him.</p>

<p>"You carry it up there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"I help you?" she said.</p>

<p>And she did. They opened the cloth. He clambered first up the
steep ladder, bearing the upper part, she followed closely,
carrying her full share. They mounted the shaky ladder in
silence, stealthily.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">IV</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As they climbed the stacks a light stopped at the gate on the
high road. It was Geoffrey, come to help his brother with the
cloth. Afraid of his own intrusion, he wheeled his bicycle
silently towards the shed. This was a corrugated iron erection,
on the opposite side of the hedge from the stacks. Geoffrey let
his light go in front of him, but there was no sign from the
lovers. He thought he saw a shadow slinking away. The light of
the bicycle lamp sheered yellowly across the dark, catching a
glint of raindrops, a mist of darkness, shadow of leaves and
strokes of long grass. Geoffrey entered the shed--no one was
there. He walked slowly and doggedly round to the stacks. He had
passed the wagon, when he heard something sheering down upon him.
Starting back under the wall of hay, he saw the long ladder
slither across the side of the stack, and fall with a bruising
ring.</p>

<p>"What wor that?" he heard Maurice, aloft, ask cautiously.</p>

<p>"Something fall," came the curious, almost pleased voice of
the Fr&auml;ulein.</p>

<p>"It wor niver th' ladder," said Maurice. He peered over the
side of the stack. He lay down, looking.</p>

<p>"It is an' a'!" he exclaimed. "We knocked it down with the
cloth, dragging it over."</p>

<p>"We fast up here?" she exclaimed with a thrill.</p>

<p>"We are that--without I shout and make 'em hear at the
Vicarage."</p>

<p>"Oh no," she said quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't want to," he replied, with a short laugh. There came
a swift clatter of raindrops on the cloth. Geoffrey crouched
under the wall of the other stack.</p>

<p>"Mind where you tread--here, let me straighten this end," said
Maurice, with a peculiar intimate tone--a command and an embrace.
"We s'll have to sit under it. At any rate, we shan't get
wet."</p>

<p>"Not get wet!" echoed the girl, pleased, but agitated.</p>

<p>Geoffrey heard the slide and rustle of the cloth over the top
of the stack, heard Maurice telling her to "Mind!"</p>

<p>"Mind!" she repeated. "Mind! you say 'Mind!'"</p>

<p>"Well, what if I do?" he laughed. "I don't want you to fall
over th' side, do I?" His tone was masterful, but he was not
quite sure of himself.</p>

<p>There was silence a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Maurice!" she said, plaintively.</p>

<p>"I'm here," he answered, tenderly, his voice shaky with
excitement that was near to distress. "There, I've done. Now
should we--we'll sit under this corner."</p>

<p>"Maurice!" she was rather pitiful.</p>

<p>"What? You'll be all right," he remonstrated, tenderly
indignant.</p>

<p>"I be all ra&iuml;ght," she repeated, "I be all ra&iuml;ght,
Maurice?"</p>

<p>"Tha knows tha will--I canna ca' thee Powla. Should I ca' thee
Minnie?"</p>

<p>It was the name of a dead sister.</p>

<p>"Minnie?" she exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>"Aye, should I?"</p>

<p>She answered in full-throated German. He laughed shakily.</p>

<p>"Come on--come on under. But do yer wish you was safe in th'
Vicarage? Should I shout for somebody?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't wish, no!" She was vehement.</p>

<p>"Art sure?" he insisted, almost indignantly.</p>

<p>"Sure--I quite sure." She laughed.</p>

<p>Geoffrey turned away at the last words. Then the rain beat
heavily. The lonely brother slouched miserably to the hut, where
the rain played a mad tattoo. He felt very miserable, and jealous
of Maurice.</p>

<p>His bicycle lamp, downcast, shone a yellow light on the stark
floor of the shed or hut with one wall open. It lit up the
trodden earth, the shafts of tools lying piled under the beam,
beside the dreary grey metal of the building. He took off the
lamp, shone it round the hut. There were piles of harness, tools,
a big sugar box, a deep bed of hay--then the beams across the
corrugated iron, all very dreary and stark. He shone the lamp
into the night: nothing but the furtive glitter of raindrops
through the mist of darkness, and black shapes hovering
round.</p>

<p>Geoffrey blew out the light and flung himself on to the hay.
He would put the ladder up for them in a while, when they would
be wanting it. Meanwhile he sat and gloated over Maurice's
felicity. He was imaginative, and now he had something concrete
to work upon. Nothing in the whole of life stirred him so
profoundly, and so utterly, as the thought of this woman. For
Paula was strange, foreign, different from the ordinary girls:
the rousing, feminine quality seemed in her concentrated,
brighter, more fascinating than in anyone he had known, so that
he felt most like a moth near a candle. He would have loved her
wildly--but Maurice had got her. His thoughts beat the same
course, round and round. What was it like when you kissed her,
when she held you tight round the waist, how did she feel towards
Maurice, did she love to touch him, was he fine and attractive to
her; what did she think of himself--she merely disregarded him,
as she would disregard a horse in a field; why should she do so,
why couldn't he make her regard himself, instead of Maurice: he
would never command a woman's regard like that, he always gave in
to her too soon; if only some woman would come and take him for
what he was worth, though he was such a stumbler and showed to
such disadvantage, ah, what a grand thing it would be; how he
would kiss her. Then round he went again in the same course,
brooding almost like a madman. Meanwhile the rain drummed deep on
the shed, then grew lighter and softer. There came the drip, drip
of the drops falling outside.</p>

<p>Geoffrey's heart leaped up his chest, and he clenched himself,
as a black shape crept round the post of the shed and, bowing,
entered silently. The young man's heart beat so heavily in
plunges, he could not get his breath to speak. It was shock,
rather than fear. The form felt towards him. He sprang up,
gripped it with his great hands, panting "Now, then!"</p>

<p>There was no resistance, only a little whimper of despair.</p>

<p>"Let me go," said a woman's voice.</p>

<p>"What are you after?" he asked, in deep, gruff tones.</p>

<p>"I thought 'e was 'ere," she wept despairingly, with little,
stubborn sobs.</p>

<p>"An' you've found what you didn't expect, have you?"</p>

<p>At the sound of his bullying she tried to get away from
him.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she said.</p>

<p>"Who did you expect to find here?" he asked, but more his
natural self.</p>

<p>"I expected my husband--him as you saw at dinner. Let me
go."</p>

<p>"Why, is it you?" exclaimed Geoffrey. "Has he left you?"</p>

<p>"Let me go," said the woman sullenly, trying to draw away. He
realized that her sleeve was very wet, her arm slender under his
grasp. Suddenly he grew ashamed of himself: he had no doubt hurt
her, gripping her so hard. He relaxed, but did not let her
go.</p>

<p>"An' are you searching round after that snipe as was here at
dinner?" he asked. She did not answer.</p>

<p>"Where did he leave you?"</p>

<p>"I left him--here. I've seen nothing of him since."</p>

<p>"I s'd think it's good riddance," he said. She did not answer.
He gave a short laugh, saying:</p>

<p>"I should ha' thought you wouldn't ha' wanted to clap eyes on
him again."</p>

<p>"He's my husband--an' he's not goin' to run off if I can stop
him."</p>

<p>Geoffrey was silent, not knowing what to say.</p>

<p>"Have you got a jacket on?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"What do you think? You've got hold of it."</p>

<p>"You're wet through, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be dry, comin' through that teemin' rain. But
'e's not here, so I'll go."</p>

<p>"I mean," he said humbly, "are you wet through?"</p>

<p>She did not answer. He felt her shiver.</p>

<p>"Are you cold?" he asked, in surprise and concern.</p>

<p>She did not answer. He did not know what to say.</p>

<p>"Stop a minute," he said, and he fumbled in his pocket for his
matches. He struck a light, holding it in the hollow of his
large, hard palm. He was a big man, and he looked anxious.
Shedding the light on her, he saw she was rather pale, and very
weary looking. Her old sailor hat was sodden and drooping with
rain. She wore a fawn-coloured jacket of smooth cloth. This
jacket was black-wet where the rain had beaten, her skirt hung
sodden, and dripped on to her boots. The match went out.</p>

<p>"Why, you're wet through!" he said.</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"Shall you stop in here while it gives over?" he asked. She
did not answer.</p>

<p>"'Cause if you will, you'd better take your things off, an'
have th' rug. There's a horse-rug in the box."</p>

<p>He waited, but she would not answer. So he lit his bicycle
lamp, and rummaged in the box, pulling out a large brown blanket,
striped with scarlet and yellow. She stood stock still. He shone
the light on her. She was very pale, and trembling fitfully.</p>

<p>"Are you that cold?" he asked in concern. "Take your jacket
off, and your hat, and put this right over you."</p>

<p>Mechanically, she undid the enormous fawn-coloured buttons,
and unpinned her hat. With her black hair drawn back from her
low, honest brow, she looked little more than a girl, like a girl
driven hard with womanhood by stress of life. She was small, and
natty, with neat little features. But she shivered
convulsively.</p>

<p>"Is something a-matter with you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I've walked to Bulwell and back," she quivered, "looking for
him--an' I've not touched a thing since this morning." She did
not weep--she was too dreary-hardened to cry. He looked at her in
dismay, his mouth half open: "Gormin", as Maurice would have
said.</p>

<p>"'Aven't you had nothing to eat?" he said.</p>

<p>Then he turned aside to the box. There, the bread remaining
was kept, and the great piece of cheese, and such things as sugar
and salt, with all table utensils: there was some butter.</p>

<p>She sat down drearily on the bed of hay. He cut her a piece of
bread and butter, and a piece of cheese. This she took, but ate
listlessly.</p>

<p>"I want a drink," she said.</p>

<p>"We 'aven't got no beer," he answered. "My father doesn't have
it."</p>

<p>"I want water," she said.</p>

<p>He took a can and plunged through the wet darkness, under the
great black hedge, down to the trough. As he came back he saw her
in the half-lit little cave sitting bunched together. The soaked
grass wet his feet--he thought of her. When he gave her a cup of
water, her hand touched his and he felt her fingers hot and
glossy. She trembled so she spilled the water.</p>

<p>"Do you feel badly?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I can't keep myself still--but it's only with being tired and
having nothing to eat."</p>

<p>He scratched his head contemplatively, waited while she ate
her piece of bread and butter. Then he offered her another
piece.</p>

<p>"I don't want it just now," she said.</p>

<p>"You'll have to eat summat," he said.</p>

<p>"I couldn't eat any more just now."</p>

<p>He put the piece down undecidedly on the box. Then there was
another long pause. He stood up with bent head. The bicycle, like
a restful animal, glittered behind him, turning towards the wall.
The woman sat hunched on the hay, shivering.</p>

<p>"Can't you get warm?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I shall by an' by--don't you bother. I'm taking your
seat--are you stopping here all night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll be goin' in a bit," she said.</p>

<p>"Nay, I non want you to go. I'm thinkin' how you could get
warm."</p>

<p>"Don't you bother about me," she remonstrated, almost
irritably.</p>

<p>"I just want to see as the stacks is all right. You take your
shoes an' stockin's an' all your wet things off: you can easy
wrap yourself all over in that rug, there's not so much of
you."</p>

<p>"It's raining--I s'll be all right--I s'll be going in a
minute."</p>

<p>"I've got to see as the stacks is safe. Take your wet things
off."</p>

<p>"Are you coming back?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I mightn't, not till morning."</p>

<p>"Well, I s'll be gone in ten minutes, then. I've no rights to
be here, an' I s'll not let anybody be turned out for me."</p>

<p>"You won't be turning me out."</p>

<p>"Whether or no, I shan't stop."</p>

<p>"Well, shall you if I come back?" he asked. She did not
answer.</p>

<p>He went. In a few moments, she blew the light out. The rain
was falling steadily, and the night was a black gulf. All was
intensely still. Geoffrey listened everywhere: no sound save the
rain. He stood between the stacks, but only heard the trickle of
water, and the light swish of rain. Everything was lost in
blackness. He imagined death was like that, many things dissolved
in silence and darkness, blotted out, but existing. In the dense
blackness he felt himself almost extinguished. He was afraid he
might not find things the same. Almost frantically, he stumbled,
feeling his way, till his hand touched the wet metal. He had been
looking for a gleam of light.</p>

<p>"Did you blow the lamp out?" he asked, fearful lest the
silence should answer him.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered humbly. He was glad to hear her voice.
Groping into the pitch-dark shed, he knocked against the box,
part of whose cover served as table. There was a clatter and a
fall.</p>

<p>"That's the lamp, an' the knife, an' the cup," he said. He
struck a match.</p>

<p>"Th' cup's not broke." He put it into the box.</p>

<p>"But th' oil's spilled out o' th' lamp. It always was a rotten
old thing." He hastily blew out his match, which was burning his
fingers. Then he struck another light.</p>

<p>"You don't want a lamp, you know you don't, and I s'll be
going directly, so you come an' lie down an' get your night's
rest. I'm not taking any of your place."</p>

<p>He looked at her by the light of another match. She was a
queer little bundle, all brown, with gaudy border folding in and
out, and her little face peering at him. As the match went out
she saw him beginning to smile.</p>

<p>"I can sit right at this end," she said. "You lie down."</p>

<p>He came and sat on the hay, at some distance from her. After a
spell of silence:</p>

<p>"Is he really your husband?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He is!" she answered grimly.</p>

<p>"Hm!" Then there was silence again.</p>

<p>After a while: "Are you warm now?"</p>

<p>"Why do you bother yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't bother myself--do you follow him because you like
him?" He put it very timidly. He wanted to know.</p>

<p>"I don't--I wish he was dead," this with bitter contempt. Then
doggedly; "But he's my husband."</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"By Gad!" he said.</p>

<p>Again, after a while: "Have you been married long?"</p>

<p>"Four years."</p>

<p>"Four years--why, how old are you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-three."</p>

<p>"Are you turned twenty-three?"</p>

<p>"Last May."</p>

<p>"Then you're four month older than me." He mused over it. They
were only two voices in the pitch-black night. It was eerie
silence again.</p>

<p>"And do you just tramp about?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He reckons he's looking for a job. But he doesn't like work
in any shape or form. He was a stableman when I married him, at
Greenhalgh's, the horse-dealers, at Chesterfield, where I was
housemaid. He left that job when the baby was only two month, and
I've been badgered about from pillar to post ever sin'. They say
a rolling stone gathers no moss . . ."</p>

<p>"An' where's the baby?"</p>

<p>"It died when it was ten month old."</p>

<p>Now the silence was clinched between them. It was quite a long
time before Geoffrey ventured to say sympathetically: "You
haven't much to look forward to."</p>

<p>"I've wished many a score time when I've started shiverin' an'
shakin' at nights, as I was taken bad for death. But we're not
that handy at dying."</p>

<p>He was silent. "But what ever shall you do?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"I s'll find him, if I drop by th' road."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked, wondering, looking her way, though he saw
nothing but solid darkness.</p>

<p>"Because I shall. He's not going to have it all his own
road."</p>

<p>"But why don't you leave him?"</p>

<p>"Because he's <i>not goin' to have it all his own
road."</i></p>

<p>She sounded very determined, even vindictive. He sat in
wonder, feeling uneasy, and vaguely miserable on her behalf. She
sat extraordinarily still. She seemed like a voice only, a
presence.</p>

<p>"Are you warm now?" he asked, half afraid.</p>

<p>"A bit warmer--but my feet!" She sounded pitiful.</p>

<p>"Let me warm them with my hands," he asked her. "I'm hot
enough."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she said, coldly.</p>

<p>Then, in the darkness, she felt she had wounded him. He was
writhing under her rebuff, for his offer had been pure
kindness.</p>

<p>"They're 'appen dirty," she said, half mocking.</p>

<p>"Well--mine is--an' I have a bath a'most every day," he
answered.</p>

<p>"I don't know when they'll get warm," she moaned to
herself.</p>

<p>"Well, then, put them in my hands."</p>

<p>She heard him faintly rattling the match-box, and then a
phosphorescent glare began to fume in his direction. Presently he
was holding two smoking, blue-green blotches of light towards her
feet. She was afraid. But her feet ached so, and the impulse
drove her on, so she placed her soles lightly on the two blotches
of smoke. His large hands clasped over her instep, warm and
hard.</p>

<p>"They're like ice!" he said, in deep concern.</p>

<p>He warmed her feet as best he could, putting them close
against him. Now and again convulsive tremors ran over her. She
felt his warm breath on the balls of her toes, that were bunched
up in his hands. Leaning forward, she touched his hair delicately
with her fingers. He thrilled. She fell to gently stroking his
hair, with timid, pleading finger-tips.</p>

<p>"Do they feel any better?" he asked, in a low voice, suddenly
lifting his face to her. This sent her hand sliding softly over
his face, and her finger-tips caught on his mouth. She drew
quickly away. He put his hand out to find hers, in his other palm
holding both her feet. His wandering hand met her face. He
touched it curiously. It was wet. He put his big fingers
cautiously on her eyes, into two little pools of tears.</p>

<p>"What's a matter?" he asked, in a low, choked voice.</p>

<p>She leaned down to him, and gripped him tightly round the
neck, pressing him to her bosom in a little frenzy of pain. Her
bitter disillusionment with life, her unalleviated shame and
degradation during the last four years, had driven her into
loneliness, and hardened her till a large part of her nature was
caked and sterile. Now she softened again, and her spring might
be beautiful. She had been in a fair way to make an ugly old
woman.</p>

<p>She clasped the head of Geoffrey to her breast, which heaved
and fell, and heaved again. He was bewildered, full of wonder. He
allowed the woman to do as she would with him. Her tears fell on
his hair, as she wept noiselessly; and he breathed deep as she
did. At last she let go her clasp. He put his arms round her.</p>

<p>"Come and let me warm you," he said, folding her up on his
knee, and lapping her with his heavy arms against himself. She
was small and <i>c&acirc;line.</i> He held her very warm and
close. Presently she stole her arms round him.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> big," she whispered.</p>

<p>He gripped her hard, started, put his mouth down wanderingly,
seeking her out. His lips met her temple. She slowly,
deliberately turned her mouth to his, and with opened lips, met
him in a kiss, his first love kiss.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">V</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was breaking cold dawn when Geoffrey woke. The woman was
still sleeping in his arms. Her face in sleep moved all his
tenderness: the tight shutting of her mouth, as if in resolution
to bear what was very hard to bear, contrasted so pitifully with
the small mould of her features. Geoffrey pressed her to his
bosom: having her, he felt he could bruise the lips of the
scornful, and pass on erect, unabateable. With her to complete
him, to form the core of him, he was firm and whole. Needing her
so much, he loved her fervently.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dawn came like death, one of those slow, livid
mornings that seem to come in a cold sweat. Slowly, and
painfully, the air began to whiten. Geoffrey saw it was not
raining. As he was watching the ghastly transformation outside,
he felt aware of something. He glanced down: she was open-eyed,
watching him; she had golden-brown, calm eyes, that immediately
smiled into his. He also smiled, bowed softly down and kissed
her. They did not speak for some time. Then:</p>

<p>"What's thy name?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Lydia," she said.</p>

<p>"Lydia!" he repeated, wonderingly. He felt rather shy.</p>

<p>"Mine's Geoffrey Wookey," he said.</p>

<p>She merely smiled at him.</p>

<p>They were silent for a considerable time. By morning light,
things look small. The huge trees of the evening were dwindling
to hoary, small, uncertain things, trespassing in the sick pallor
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>There was a dense mist, so that the light could scarcely
breathe. Everything seemed to quiver with cold and
sickliness.</p>

<p>"Have you often slept out?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Not so very," she answered.</p>

<p>"You won't go after <i>him</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I s'll have to," she replied, but she nestled in to Geoffrey.
He felt a sudden panic.</p>

<p>"You musn't," he exclaimed, and she saw he was afraid for
himself. She let it be, was silent.</p>

<p>"We couldn't get married?" he asked, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He brooded deeply over this. At length:</p>

<p>"Would you go to Canada with me?"</p>

<p>"We'll see what you think in two months' time," she replied
quietly, without bitterness.</p>

<p>"I s'll think the same," he protested, hurt.</p>

<p>She did not answer, only watched him steadily. She was there
for him to do as he liked with; but she would not injure his
fortunes; no, not to save his soul.</p>

<p>"Haven't you got no relations?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A married sister at Crick."</p>

<p>"On a farm?"</p>

<p>"No--married a farm labourer--but she's very comfortable. I'll
go there, if you want me to, just till I can get another place in
service."</p>

<p>He considered this.</p>

<p>"Could you get on a farm?" he asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"Greenhalgh's was a farm."</p>

<p>He saw the future brighten: she would be a help to him. She
agreed to go to her sister, and to get a place of service--until
Spring, he said, when they would sail for Canada. He waited for
her assent.</p>

<p>"You will come with me, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"When the time comes," she said.</p>

<p>Her want of faith made him bow his head: she had reason for
it.</p>

<p>"Shall you walk to Crick, or go from Langley Mill to
Ambergate? But it's only ten mile to walk. So we can go together
up Hunt's Hill--you'd have to go past our lane-end, then I could
easy nip down an' fetch you some money," he said, humbly.</p>

<p>"I've got half a sovereign by me--it's more than I s'll
want."</p>

<p>"Let's see it," he said.</p>

<p>After a while, fumbling under the blanket, she brought out the
piece of money. He felt she was independent of him. Brooding
rather bitterly, he told himself she'd forsake him. His anger
gave him courage to ask:</p>

<p>"Shall you go in service in your maiden name?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He was bitterly wrathful with her--full of resentment.</p>

<p>"I bet I s'll niver see you again," he said, with a short,
hard laugh. She put her arms round him, pressed him to her bosom,
while the tears rose to her eyes. He was reassured, but not
satisfied.</p>

<p>"Shall you write to me to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>"And can I write to you--who shall I write to?"</p>

<p>"Mrs Bredon."</p>

<p>"'Bredon'!" he repeated bitterly.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly uneasy.</p>

<p>The dawn had grown quite wan. He saw the hedges drooping wet
down the grey mist. Then he told her about Maurice.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>shouldn't</i>!" she said. "You should ha' put the
ladder up for them, you <i>should."</i></p>

<p>"Well--I don't care."</p>

<p>"Go and do it now--and I'll go."</p>

<p>"No, don't you. Stop an' see our Maurice, go on, stop an' see
him--then I s'll be able to tell him."</p>

<p>She consented in silence. He had her promise she would not go
before he returned. She adjusted her dress, found her way to the
trough, where she performed her toilet.</p>

<p>Geoffrey wandered round to the upper field. The stacks looked
wet in the mist, the hedge was drenched. Mist rose like steam
from the grass, and the near hills were veiled almost to a
shadow. In the valley, some peaks of black poplar showed fairly
definite, jutting up. He shivered with chill.</p>

<p>There was no sound from the stacks, and he could see nothing.
After all, he wondered, were they up there. But he reared the
ladder to the place whence it had been swept, then went down the
hedge to gather dry sticks. He was breaking off thin dead twigs
under a holly tree when he heard, on the perfectly still air:
"Well I'm dashed!"</p>

<p>He listened intently. Maurice was awake.</p>

<p>"Sithee here!" the lad's voice exclaimed. Then, after a while,
the foreign sound of the girl:</p>

<p>"What--oh, thair!"</p>

<p>"Aye, th' ladder's there, right enough."</p>

<p>"You said it had fall down."</p>

<p>"Well, I heard it drop--an' I couldna feel it nor see it."</p>

<p>"You said it had fall down--you lie, you liar."</p>

<p>"Nay, as true as I'm here--"</p>

<p>"You tell me lies--make me stay here--you tell me lies--" She
was passionately indignant.</p>

<p>"As true as I'm standing here--" he began.</p>

<p>"Lies!--lies!--lies!" she cried. "I don't believe you, never.
You <i>mean,</i> you <i>mean, mean, mean</i>!"</p>

<p>"A' ra&iuml;ght, then!" he was now incensed, in his turn.</p>

<p>"You are bad, mean, mean, mean."</p>

<p>"Are yer commin' down?" asked Maurice, coldly.</p>

<p>"No--I will not come with you--mean, to tell me lies."</p>

<p>"Are ter commin' down?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't want you."</p>

<p>"A' ra&iuml;ght, then!"</p>

<p>Geoffrey, peering through the holly tree, saw Maurice
negotiating the ladder. The top rung was below the brim of the
stack, and rested on the cloth, so it was dangerous to approach.
The Fr&auml;ulein watched him from the end of the stack, where
the cloth thrown back showed the light, dry hay. He slipped
slightly, she screamed. When he had got on to the ladder, he
pulled the cloth away, throwing it back, making it easy for her
to descend.</p>

<p>"Now are ter comin'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No!" she shook her head violently, in a pet.</p>

<p>Geoffrey felt slightly contemptuous of her. But Maurice
waited.</p>

<p>"Are ter comin'?" he called again.</p>

<p>"No," she flashed, like a wild cat.</p>

<p>"All right, then I'm going."</p>

<p>He descended. At the bottom, he stood holding the ladder.</p>

<p>"Come on, while I hold it steady," he said.</p>

<p>There was no reply. For some minutes he stood patiently with
his foot on the bottom rung of the ladder. He was pale, rather
washed-out in his appearance, and he drew himself together with
cold.</p>

<p>"Are ter commin', or aren't ter?" he asked at length. Still
there was no reply.</p>

<p>"Then stop up till tha'rt ready," he muttered, and he went
away. Round the other side of the stacks he met Geoffrey.</p>

<p>"What, are tha&iuml;gh here?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Bin here a' na&iuml;ght," replied Geoffrey. "I come to help
thee wi' th' cloth, but I found it on, an' th' ladder down, so I
thowt tha'd gone."</p>

<p>"Did ter put th' ladder up?"</p>

<p>"I did a bit sin."</p>

<p>Maurice brooded over this, Geoffrey struggled with himself to
get out his own news. At last he blurted:</p>

<p>"Tha knows that woman as wor here yis'day dinner--'er come
back, an' stopped i' th' shed a' night, out o' th' rain."</p>

<p>"Oh--ah!" said Maurice, his eye kindling, and a smile crossing
his pallor.</p>

<p>"An' I s'll gi'e her some breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh--ah!" repeated Maurice.</p>

<p>"It's th' man as is good-for-nowt, not her," protested
Geoffrey. Maurice did not feel in a position to cast stones.</p>

<p>"Tha pleases thysen," he said, "what ter does." He was very
quiet, unlike himself. He seemed bothered and anxious, as
Geoffrey had not seen him before.</p>

<p>"What's up wi' thee?" asked the elder brother, who in his own
heart was glad, and relieved.</p>

<p>"Nowt," was the reply.</p>

<p>They went together to the hut. The woman was folding the
blanket. She was fresh from washing, and looked very pretty. Her
hair, instead of being screwed tightly back, was coiled in a knot
low down, partly covering her ears. Before, she had deliberately
made herself plain-looking: now she was neat and pretty, with a
sweet, womanly gravity.</p>

<p>"Hello. I didn't think to find you here," said Maurice, very
awkwardly, smiling. She watched him gravely without reply. "But
it was better in shelter than outside, last night," he added.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"Shall you get a few more sticks?" Geoffrey asked him. It was
a new thing for Geoffrey to be leader. Maurice obeyed. He
wandered forth into the damp, raw morning. He did not go to the
stack, as he shrank from meeting Paula.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the hut, Geoffrey was making the fire. The
woman got out coffee from the box: Geoffrey set the tin to boil.
They were arranging breakfast when Paula appeared. She was
hatless. Bits of hay stuck in her hair, and she was
white-faced--altogether, she did not show to advantage.</p>

<p>"Ah--you!" she exclaimed, seeing Geoffrey.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he answered. "You're out early."</p>

<p>"Where's Maurice?"</p>

<p>"I dunno, he should be back directly."</p>

<p>Paula was silent.</p>

<p>"When have you come?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I come last night, but I could see nobody about. I got up
half an hour sin', an' put th' ladder up ready to take the
stack-cloth up."</p>

<p>Paula understood, and was silent. When Maurice returned with
the faggots, she was crouched warming her hands. She looked up at
him, but he kept his eyes averted from her. Geoffrey met the eyes
of Lydia, and smiled. Maurice put his hands to the fire.</p>

<p>"You cold?" asked Paula tenderly.</p>

<p>"A bit," he answered, quite friendly, but reserved. And all
the while the four sat round the fire, drinking their smoked
coffee, eating each a small piece of toasted bacon, Paula watched
eagerly for the eyes of Maurice, and he avoided her. He was
gentle, but would not give his eyes to her looks. And Geoffrey
smiled constantly to Lydia, who watched gravely.</p>

<p>The German girl succeeded in getting safely into the Vicarage,
her escapade unknown to anyone save the housemaid. Before a week
was out, she was openly engaged to Maurice, and when her month's
notice expired, she went to live at the farm.</p>

<p>Geoffrey and Lydia kept faith one with the other.</p>

<h1><a name="s04">MOTHER AND DAUGHTER</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Virginia Bodoin had a good job: she was head of a department
in a certain government office, held a responsible position, and
earned, to imitate Balzac and be precise about it, seven hundred
and fifty pounds a year. That is already something. Rachel
Bodoin, her mother, had an income of about six hundred a year, on
which she had lived in the capitals of Europe since the
effacement of a never very important husband.</p>

<p>Now, after some years of virtual separation and "freedom",
mother and daughter once more thought of settling down. They had
become, in course of time, more like a married couple than mother
and daughter. They knew one another very well indeed, and each
was a little "nervous" of the other. They had lived together and
parted several times. Virginia was now thirty, and she didn't
look like marrying. For four years she had been as good as
married to Henry Lubbock, a rather spoilt young man who was
musical. Then Henry let her down: for two reasons. He couldn't
stand her mother. Her mother couldn't stand him. And anybody whom
Mrs Bodoin could not stand she managed to sit on, disastrously.
So Henry had writhed horribly, feeling his mother-in-law sitting
on him tight, and Virginia, after all, in a helpless sort of
family loyalty, sitting alongside her mother. Virginia didn't
really want to sit on Henry. But when her mother egged her on,
she couldn't help it. For ultimately, her mother had power over
her; a strange <i>female</i> power, nothing to do with parental
authority. Virginia had long thrown parental authority to the
winds. But her mother had another, much subtler form of
domination, female and thrilling, so that when Rachel said: Let's
squash him! Virginia had to rush wickedly and gleefully to the
sport. And Henry knew quite well when he was being squashed. So
that was one of his reasons for going back on Vinny.--He called
her Vinny, to the superlative disgust of Mrs Bodoin, who always
corrected him: My daughter <i>Virginia--</i></p>

<p>The second reason was, again to be Balzacian, that Virginia
hadn't a sou of her own. Henry had a sorry two hundred and fifty.
Virginia, at the age of twenty-four, was already earning four
hundred and fifty. But she was earning them. Whereas Henry
managed to earn about twelve pounds per annum, by his precious
music. He had realized that he would find it hard to earn more.
So that marrying, except with a wife who could keep him, was
rather out of the question. Vinny would inherit her mother's
money. But then Mrs Bodoin had the health and muscular equipment
of the Sphinx. She would live forever, seeking whom she might
devour, and devouring him. Henry lived with Vinny for two years,
in the married sense of the words: and Vinny felt they
<i>were</i> married, minus a mere ceremony. But Vinny had her
mother always in the background; often as far back as Paris or
Biarritz, but still, within letter reach. And she never realized
the funny little grin that came on her own elvish face when her
mother, even in a letter, spread her skirts and calmly sat on
Henry. She never realized that in spirit she promptly and
mischievously sat on him too: she could no more have helped it
than the tide can help turning to the moon. And she did not dream
that he felt it, and was utterly mortified in his masculine
vanity. Women, very often, hypnotize one another, and then,
hypnotized, they proceed gently to wring the neck of the man they
think they are loving with all their hearts. Then they call it
utter perversity on his part, that he doesn't like having his
neck wrung. They think he is repudiating a heart-felt love. For
they are hypnotized. Women hypnotize one another, without knowing
it.</p>

<p>In the end, Henry backed out. He saw himself being simply
reduced to nothingness by two women, an old witch with muscles
like the Sphinx, and a young, spell-bound witch, lavish, elvish
and weak, who utterly spoilt him but who ate his marrow.</p>

<p>Rachel would write from Paris: My dear Virginia, as I had a
windfall in the way of an investment, I am sharing it with you.
You will find enclosed my cheque for twenty pounds. No doubt you
will be needing it to buy Henry a suit of clothes, since the
spring is apparently come, and the sunlight may be tempted to
show him up for what he is worth. I don't want my daughter going
around with what is presumably a street-corner musician, but
please pay the tailor's bill yourself, or you may have to do it
over again later.--Henry got a suit of clothes, but it was as
good as a shirt of Nessus, eating him away with subtle
poison.</p>

<p>So he backed out. He didn't jump out, or bolt, or carve his
way out at the sword's point. He sort of faded out, distributing
his departure over a year or more. He was fond of Vinny, and he
could hardly do without her, and he was sorry for her. But at
length he couldn't see her apart from her mother. She was a
young, weak, spendthrift witch, accomplice of her tough-clawed
witch of a mother.</p>

<p>Henry made other alliances, got a good hold on elsewhere, and
gradually extricated himself. He saved his life, but he had lost,
he felt, a good deal of his youth and marrow. He tended now to go
fat, a little puffy, somewhat insignificant. And he had been
handsome and striking-looking.</p>

<p>The two witches howled when he was lost to them. Poor Virginia
was really half crazy, she didn't know what to do with herself.
She had a violent recoil from her mother. Mrs Bodoin was filled
with furious contempt for her daughter: that she should let such
a hooked fish slip out of her hands! that she should allow such a
person to turn her down!--"I don't quite see my daughter seduced
and thrown over by a sponging individual such as Henry Lubbock,"
she wrote. "But if it has happened, I suppose it is somebody's
fault--"</p>

<p>There was a mutual recoil, which lasted nearly five years. But
the spell was not broken. Mrs Bodoin's mind never left her
daughter, and Virginia was ceaselessly aware of her mother,
somewhere in the universe. They wrote, and met at intervals, but
they kept apart in recoil.</p>

<p>The spell, however, was between them, and gradually it worked.
They felt more friendly. Mrs Bodoin came to London. She stayed in
the same quiet hotel with her daughter: Virginia had had two
rooms in an hotel for the past three years. And, at last, they
thought of taking an apartment together.</p>

<p>Virginia was now over thirty. She was still thin and odd and
elvish, with a very slight and piquant cast in one of her brown
eyes, and she still had her odd, twisted smile, and her slow,
rather deep-toned voice, that caressed a man like the stroking of
subtle finger-tips. Her hair was still a natural tangle of curls,
a bit dishevelled. She still dressed with a natural elegance
which tended to go wrong and a tiny bit sluttish. She still might
have a hole in her expensive and perfectly new stockings, and
still she might have to take off her shoes in the drawing-room,
if she came to tea, and sit there in her stockinged-feet. True,
she had elegant feet: she was altogether elegantly shaped. But it
wasn't that. It was neither coquetry nor vanity. It was simply
that, after having gone to a good shoemaker and paid five guineas
for a pair of perfectly simple and natural shoes, made to her
feet, the said shoes would hurt her excruciatingly, when she had
walked half a mile in them, and she would simply have to take
them off, even if she sat on the kerb to do it. It was a
fatality. There was a touch of the <i>gamin</i> in her very feet,
a certain sluttishness that wouldn't let them stay properly in
nice proper shoes. She practically always wore her mother's old
shoes.--Of course I go through life in mother's old shoes. If she
died and left me without a supply, I suppose I should have to go
in a bathchair, she would say, with her odd twisted little grin.
She was so elegant, and yet a slut. It was her charm, really.</p>

<p>Just the opposite of her mother. They could wear each other's
shoes and each other's clothes, which seemed remarkable, for Mrs
Bodoin seemed so much the bigger of the two. But Virginia's
shoulders were broad, if she was thin, she had a strong frame,
even when she looked a frail rag.</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin was one of those women of sixty or so, with a
terrible inward energy and a violent sort of vitality. But she
managed to hide it. She sat with perfect repose, and folded
hands. One thought: What a calm woman! Just as one may look at
the snowy summit of a quiescent volcano, in the evening light,
and think: What peace!</p>

<p>It was a strange <i>muscular</i> energy which possessed Mrs
Bodoin, as it possesses, curiously enough, many women over fifty,
and is usually distasteful in its manifestations. Perhaps it
accounts for the lassitude of the young.</p>

<p>But Mrs Bodoin recognized the bad taste in her energetic
coevals, so she cultivated repose. Her very way of pronouncing
the word, in two syllables: re-pose, making the second syllable
run on into the twilight, showed how much suppressed energy she
had. Faced with the problem of iron-grey hair and black eyebrows,
she was too clever to try dyeing herself back into youth. She
studied her face, her whole figure, and decided that it was
<i>positive.</i> There was no denying it. There was no wispiness,
no hollowness, no limp frail blossom-on-a-bending-stalk about
her. Her figure, though not stout, was full, strong, and
<i>cambr&eacute;.</i> Her face had an aristocratic arched nose,
aristocratic, who-the-devil-are-you grey eyes, and cheeks rather
long but also rather full. Nothing appealing or youthfully
skittish here.</p>

<p>Like an independent woman, she used her wits, and decided most
emphatically not to be either youthful or skittish or appealing.
She would keep her dignity, for she was fond of it. She was
positive. She liked to be positive. She was used to her
positivity. So she would just <i>be</i> positive.</p>

<p>She turned to the positive period; to the eighteenth century,
to Voltaire, to Ninon de l'Enclos and the Pompadour, to Madame la
Duchesse and Monsieur le Marquis. She decided that she was not
much in the line of la Pompadour or la Duchesse, but almost
exactly in the line of Monsieur le Marquis. And she was right.
With hair silvering to white, brushed back clean from her
positive brow and temples, cut short, but sticking out a little
behind, with her rather full, pink face and thin black eyebrows
plucked to two fine, superficial crescents, her arching nose and
her rather full insolent eyes she was perfectly
eighteenth-century, the early half. That she was Monsieur le
Marquis rather than Madame la Marquise made her really
modern.</p>

<p>Her appearance was perfect. She wore delicate combinations of
grey and pink, maybe with a darkening iron-grey touch, and her
jewels were of soft old coloured paste. Her bearing was a sort of
alert repose, very calm, but very assured. There was, to use a
vulgarism, no getting past her.</p>

<p>She had a couple of thousand pounds she could lay hands on.
Virginia, of course, was always in debt. But, after all, Virginia
was not to be sniffed at. She made seven hundred and fifty a
year.</p>

<p>Virginia was oddly clever, and not clever. She didn't
<i>really</i> know anything, because anything and everything was
interesting to her for the moment, and she picked it up at once.
She picked up languages with extraordinary ease, she was fluent
in a fortnight. This helped her enormously with her job. She
could prattle away with heads of industry, let them come from
where they liked. But she didn't <i>know</i> any language, not
even her own. She picked things up in her sleep, so to speak,
without knowing anything about them.</p>

<p>And this made her popular with men. With all her curious
facility, they didn't feel small in front of her, because she was
like an instrument. She had to be prompted. Some man had to set
her in motion, and then she worked, really cleverly. She could
collect the most valuable information. She was very useful. She
worked with men, spent most of her time with men, her friends
were practically all men. She didn't feel easy with women.</p>

<p>Yet she had no lover, nobody seemed eager to marry her, nobody
seemed eager to come close to her at all. Mrs Bodoin said: I'm
afraid Virginia is a one-man woman. I am a one-man woman. So was
my mother, and so was my grandmother. Virginia's father was the
only man in my life, the only one. And I'm afraid Virginia is the
same, tenacious. Unfortunately, the man was what he was, and her
life is just left there.</p>

<p>Henry had said, in the past, that Mrs Bodoin wasn't a one-man
woman, she was a no-man woman, and that if she could have had her
way, everything male would have been wiped off the face of the
earth, and only the female element left.</p>

<p>However, Mrs Bodoin thought that it was now time to make a
move. So she and Virginia took a quite handsome apartment in one
of the old Bloomsbury Squares, fitted it up and furnished it with
extreme care, and with some quite lovely things, got in a very
good man, an Austrian, to cook, and they set up married life
together, mother and daughter.</p>

<p>At first it was rather thrilling. The two reception-rooms,
looking down on the dirty old trees of the square garden, were of
splendid proportions, and each with three great windows coming
down low, almost to the level of the knees. The chimney-piece was
late eighteenth-century. Mrs Bodoin furnished the rooms with a
gentle suggestion of Louis Seize merged with Empire, without
keeping to any particular style. But she had, saved from her own
home, a really remarkable Aubusson carpet. It looked almost new,
as if it had been woven two years ago, and was startling, yet
somehow rather splendid, as it spread its rose-red borders and
wonderful florid array of silver-grey and gold-grey roses, lilies
and gorgeous swans and trumpeting volutes away over the floor.
Very aesthetic people found it rather loud, they preferred the
worn, dim yellowish Aubusson in the big bedroom. But Mrs Bodoin
loved her drawing-room carpet. It was positive, but it was not
vulgar. It had a certain grand air in its floridity. She felt it
gave her a proper footing. And it behaved very well with her
painted cabinets and grey-and-gold brocade chairs and big Chinese
vases, which she liked to fill with big flowers: single Chinese
peonies, big roses, great tulips, orange lilies. The dim room of
London, with all its atmospheric colour, would stand the big,
free, fisticuffing flowers.</p>

<p>Virginia, for the first time in her life, had the pleasure of
making a home. She was again entirely under her mother's spell,
and swept away, thrilled to her marrow. She had had no idea that
her mother had got such treasures as the carpets and painted
cabinets and brocade chairs up her sleeve: many of them the
d&eacute;bris of the Fitzpatrick home in Ireland, Mrs Bodoin
being a Fitzpatrick. Almost like a child, like a bride, Virginia
threw herself into the business of fixing up the rooms. "Of
course, Virginia, I consider this is <i>your</i> apartment," said
Mrs Bodoin. "I am nothing but your <i>dame de compagnie,</i> and
shall carry out your wishes entirely, if you will only express
them."</p>

<p>Of course Virginia expressed a few, but not many. She
introduced some wild pictures bought from impecunious artists
whom she patronized. Mrs Bodoin thought the pictures positive
about the wrong things, but as far as possible, she let them
stay: looking on them as the necessary element of modern
ugliness. But by that element of modern ugliness, wilfully so, it
was easy to see the things that Virginia had introduced into the
apartment.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing goes to the head like setting up house. You
can get drunk on it. You feel you are creating something.
Nowadays it is no longer the "home", the domestic nest. It is "my
rooms", or "my house", the great garment which reveals and
clothes "my personality". Mrs Bodoin, deliberately scheming for
Virginia, kept moderately cool over it, but even she was thrilled
to the marrow, and of an intensity and ferocity with the
decorators and furnishers, astonishing. But Virginia was just all
the time tipsy with it, as if she had touched some magic button
on the grey wall of life, and with an Open Sesame! her lovely and
coloured rooms had begun to assemble out of fairyland. It was far
more vivid and wonderful to her than if she had inherited a
duchy.</p>

<p>The mother and daughter, the mother in a sort of faded russet
crimson and the daughter in silver, began to entertain. They had,
of course, mostly men. It filled Mrs Bodoin with a sort of savage
impatience to entertain women. Besides, most of Virginia's
acquaintances were men. So there were dinners and well-arranged
evenings.</p>

<p>It went well, but something was missing. Mrs Bodoin wanted to
be gracious, so she held herself rather back. She stayed a little
distant, was calm, reposed, eighteenth-century, and determined to
be a foil to the clever and slightly-elvish Virginia. It was a
pose, and alas, it stopped something. She was very nice with the
men, no matter what her contempt of them. But the men were uneasy
with her: afraid.</p>

<p>What they all felt, all the men guests, was that <i>for
them,</i> nothing really happened. Everything that happened was
between mother and daughter. All the flow was between mother and
daughter. A subtle, hypnotic spell encompassed the two women, and
try as they might, the men were shut out. More than one young
man, a little dazzled, <i>began</i> to fall in love with
Virginia. But it was impossible. Not only was he shut out, he
was, in some way, annihilated. The spontaneity was killed in his
bosom. While the two women sat, brilliant and rather wonderful,
in magnetic connection at opposite ends of the table, like two
witches, a double Circe turning the men not into swine--the men
would have liked that well enough--but into lumps.</p>

<p>It was tragic. Because Mrs Bodoin wanted Virginia to fall in
love and marry. She really wanted it, and she attributed
Virginia's lack of forthcoming to the delinquent Henry. She never
realized the hypnotic spell, which of course encompassed her as
well as Virginia, and made men just an impossibility to both
women, mother and daughter alike.</p>

<p>At this time, Mrs Bodoin hid her humour. She had a really
marvellous faculty of humorous imitation. She could imitate the
Irish servants from her old home, or the American women who
called on her, or the modern lady-like young men, the asphodels,
as she called them: "Of course you know the asphodel is a kind of
onion! Oh yes, just an over-bred onion": who wanted, with their
murmuring voices and peeping under their brows, to make her feel
very small and very bourgeois. She could imitate them all with a
humour that was really touched with genius. But it was
devastating. It demolished the objects of her humour so
absolutely, smashed them to bits with a ruthless hammer, pounded
them to nothing so terribly, that it frightened people,
particularly men. It frightened men off.</p>

<p>So she hid it. She hid it. But there it was, up her sleeve,
her merciless, hammer-like humour, which just smashed its object
on the head and left him brained. She tried to disown it. She
tried to pretend, even to Virginia, that she had the gift no
more. But in vain; the hammer hidden up her sleeve hovered over
the head of every guest, and every guest felt his scalp creep,
and Virginia felt her inside creep with a little, mischievous,
slightly idiotic grin, as still another fool male was mystically
knocked on the head. It was a sort of uncanny sport.</p>

<p>No, the plan was not going to work: the plan of having
Virginia fall in love and marry. Of course the men <i>were</i>
such lumps, such <i>oeufs farcies.</i> There was one, at least,
that Mrs Bodoin had real hopes of. He was a healthy and normal
and very good-looking boy of good family, with no money, alas,
but clerking to the House of Lords and very hopeful, and not very
clever, but simply in love with Virginia's cleverness. He was
just the one Mrs Bodoin would have married for herself. True, he
was only twenty-six, to Virginia's thirty-one. But he had rowed
in the Oxford eight, and adored horses, talked horses adorably,
and was simply infatuated by Virginia's cleverness. To him
Virginia had the finest mind on earth. She was as wonderful as
Plato, but infinitely more attractive, because she was a woman,
and winsome with it. Imagine a winsome Plato with untidy curls
and the tiniest little brown-eyed squint and just a hint of
woman's pathetic need for a protector, and you may imagine
Adrian's feeling for Virginia. He adored her on his knees, but he
felt he could protect her.</p>

<p>"Of course he's just a very nice <i>boy</i>!" said Mrs Bodoin.
"He's a boy, and that's all you can say. And he always will be a
boy. But that's the very nicest kind of man, the only kind you
can live with: the eternal boy. Virginia, aren't you attracted to
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother! I think he's an awfully nice <i>boy</i>, as you
say," replied Virginia, in her rather slow, musical, whimsical
voice. But the mocking little curl in the intonation put the lid
on Adrian. Virginia was not marrying a nice <i>boy</i>! She could
be malicious too, against her mother's taste. And Mrs Bodoin let
escape her a faint gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>For she had been planning her own retreat, planning to give
Virginia the apartment outright, and half of her own income, if
she would marry Adrian. Yes, the mother was already scheming how
best she could live with dignity on three hundred a year, once
Virginia was happily married to that most attractive if slightly
brainless <i>boy</i>.</p>

<p>A year later, when Virginia was thirty-two, Adrian, who had
married a wealthy American girl and been transferred to a job in
the legation at Washington in the meantime, faithfully came to
see Virginia as soon as he was in London, faithfully kneeled at
her feet, faithfully thought her the most wonderful spiritual
being, and faithfully felt that she, Virginia, could have done
wonders with him, which wonders would now never be done, for he
had married in the meantime.</p>

<p>Virginia was looking haggard and worn. The scheme of a
<i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; deux</i> with her mother had not
succeeded. And now, work was telling on the younger woman. It is
true, she was amazingly facile. But facility wouldn't get her all
the way. She had to earn her money, and earn it hard. She had to
slog, and she had to concentrate. While she could work by quick
intuition and without much responsibility, work thrilled her. But
as soon as she had to get down to it, as they say, grip and slog
and concentrate, in a really responsible position, it wore her
out terribly. She had to do it all off her nerves. She hadn't the
same sort of fighting power as a man. Where a man can summon his
old Adam in him to fight through his work, a woman has to draw on
her nerves, and on her nerves alone. For the old Eve in her will
have nothing to do with such work. So that mental responsibility,
mental concentration, mental slogging wear out a woman terribly,
especially if she is head of a department, and not working
<i>for</i> somebody.</p>

<p>So poor Virginia was worn out. She was thin as a rail. Her
nerves were frayed to bits. And she could never forget her
beastly work. She would come home at teatime speechless and done
for. Her mother, tortured by the sight of her, longed to say: Has
anything gone wrong, Virginia? Have you had anything particularly
trying at the office today?--But she learned to hold her tongue,
and say nothing. The question would be the last straw to
Virginia's poor overwrought nerves, and there would be a little
scene which, despite Mrs Bodoin's calm and forbearance, offended
the elder woman to the quick. She had learned, by bitter
experience, to leave her child alone, as one would leave a frail
tube of vitriol alone. But of course, she could not keep her
<i>mind</i> off Virginia. That was impossible. And poor Virginia,
under the strain of work and the strain of her mother's awful
ceaseless mind, was at the very end of her strength and
resources.</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin had always disliked the fact of Virginia's doing a
job. But now she hated it. She hated the whole government office
with violent and virulent hate. Not only was it undignified for
Virginia to be tied up there, but it was turning her, Mrs
Bodoin's daughter, into a thin, nagging, fearsome old maid. Could
anything be more utterly English and humiliating to a well-born
Irishwoman?</p>

<p>After a long day attending to the apartment, skilfully darning
one of the brocade chairs, polishing the Venetian mirrors to her
satisfaction, selecting flowers, doing certain shopping and
housekeeping, attending perfectly to everything, then receiving
callers in the afternoon, with never-ending energy, Mrs Bodoin
would go up from the drawing-room after tea and write a few
letters, take her bath, dress with great care--she enjoyed
attending to her person--and come down to dinner as fresh as a
daisy, but far more energetic than that quiet flower. She was
ready now for a full evening.</p>

<p>She was conscious, with gnawing anxiety, of Virginia's
presence in the house, but she did not see her daughter till
dinner was announced. Virginia slipped in, and away to her room
unseen, never going into the drawing-room to tea. If Mrs Bodoin
heard her daughter's key in the latch, she quickly retired into
one of the rooms till Virginia was safely through. It was too
much for poor Virginia's nerves even to catch sight of anybody in
the house, when she came in from the office. Bad enough to hear
the murmur of visitors' voices behind the drawing-room door.</p>

<p>And Mrs Bodoin would wonder: How is she? How is she to-night?
I wonder what sort of a day she's had?--And this thought would
roam prowling through the house, to where Virginia was lying on
her back in her room. But the mother would have to consume her
anxiety till dinner-time. And then Virginia would appear, with
black lines under her eyes, thin, tense, a young woman out of an
office, the stigma upon her: badly dressed, a little acid in
humour, with an impaired digestion, not interested in anything,
blighted by her work. And Mrs Bodoin, humiliated at the very
sight of her, would control herself perfectly, say nothing but
the mere smooth nothings of casual speech, and sit in perfect
form presiding at a carefully-cooked dinner thought out entirely
to please Virginia. Then Virginia hardly noticed what she
ate.</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin was pining for an evening with life in it. But
Virginia would lie on the couch and put on the loudspeaker. Or
she would put a humorous record on the gramophone, and be amused,
and hear it again, and be amused, and hear it again, six times,
and six times be amused by a mildly funny record that Mrs Bodoin
now knew off by heart. "Why, Virginia, I could repeat that record
over to you, if you wished it, without your troubling to wind up
that gramophone."--And Virginia, after a pause in which she
seemed not to have heard what her mother said, would reply, "I'm
sure you could, mother". And that simple speech would convey such
volumes of contempt for all that Rachel Bodoin was or ever could
be or ever had been, contempt for her energy, her vitality, her
mind, her body, her very existence, that the elder woman would
curl. It seemed as if the ghost of Robert Bodoin spoke out of the
mouth of the daughter, in deadly venom.--Then Virginia would put
on the record for the seventh time.</p>

<p>During the second ghastly year, Mrs Bodoin realized that the
game was up. She was a beaten woman, a woman without object or
meaning any more. The hammer of her awful female humour, which
had knocked so many people on the head, all the people, in fact,
that she had come into contact with, had at last flown backwards
and hit herself on the head. For her daughter was her other self,
her <i>alter ego.</i> The secret and the meaning and the power of
Mrs Bodoin's whole life lay in the hammer, that hammer of her
living humour which knocked everything on the head. That had been
her lust and her passion, knocking everybody and everything
humorously on the head. She had felt inspired in it: it was a
sort of mission. And she had hoped to hand on the hammer to
Virginia, her clever, unsolid but still actual daughter,
Virginia. Virginia was the continuation of Rachel's own self.
Virginia was Rachel's <i>alter ego,</i> her other self.</p>

<p>But, alas, it was a half-truth. Virginia had had a father.
This fact, which had been utterly ignored by the mother, was
gradually brought home to her by the curious recoil of the
hammer. Virginia was her father's daughter. Could anything be
more unseemly, horrid, more perverse in the natural scheme of
things? For Robert Bodoin had been fully and deservedly knocked
on the head by Rachel's hammer. Could anything, then, be more
disgusting than that he should resurrect again in the person of
Mrs Bodoin's own daughter, her own <i>alter ego</i> Virginia, and
start hitting back with a little spiteful hammer that was David's
pebble against Goliath's battle-axe!</p>

<p>But the little pebble was mortal. Mrs Bodoin felt it sink into
her brow, her temple, and she was finished. The hammer fell
nerveless from her hand.</p>

<p>The two women were now mostly alone. Virginia was too tired to
have company in the evening. So there was the gramophone or
loudspeaker, or else silence. Both women had come to loathe the
apartment. Virginia felt it was the last grand act of bullying on
her mother's part, she felt bullied by the assertive Aubusson
carpet, by the beastly Venetian mirrors, by the big overcultured
flowers. She even felt bullied by the excellent food, and longed
again for a Soho restaurant and her two poky shabby rooms in the
hotel. She loathed the apartment: she loathed everything. But she
had not the energy to move. She had not the energy to do
anything. She crawled to her work, and for the rest, she lay
flat, gone.</p>

<p>It was Virginia's worn-out inertia that really finished Mrs
Bodoin. That was the pebble that broke the bone of her temple:
"To have to attend my daughter's funeral, and accept the sympathy
of all her fellow-clerks in her office, no, that is a final
humiliation which I must spare myself. No! If Virginia must be a
lady-clerk, she must be it henceforth on her own responsibility.
I will retire from her existence."</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin had tried hard to persuade Virginia to give up her
work and come and live with her. She had offered her half her
income. In vain. Virginia stuck to her office.</p>

<p>Very well! So be it!--The apartment was a fiasco, Mrs Bodoin
was longing, longing to tear it to pieces again. One last and
final blow of the hammer!--"Virginia, don't you think we'd better
get rid of this apartment, and live around as we used to? Don't
you think we'll do that?"--"But all the money you've put into it?
And the lease for ten years!" cried Virginia, in a kind of
inertia.--"Never mind! We had the pleasure of making it. And
we've had as much pleasure out of living in it as we shall ever
have. Now we'd better get rid of it--quickly--don't you
think?"</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin's arms were twitching to snatch the pictures off
the walls, roll up the Aubusson carpet, take the china out of the
ivory-inlaid cabinet there and then, at that very moment.</p>

<p>"Let us wait till Sunday before we decide," said Virginia.</p>

<p>"Till Sunday! Four days! As long as that? Haven't we already
decided in our own minds?" said Mrs Bodoin.</p>

<p>"We'll wait till Sunday, anyhow," said Virginia.</p>

<p>The next evening, the Armenian came to dinner. Virginia called
him Arnold, with the French pronunciation, Arnault. Mrs Bodoin,
who barely tolerated him, and could never get his name, which
seemed to have a lot of bouyoums in it, called him either the
Armenian, or the Rahat Lakoum, after the name of the sweetmeat,
or simply The Turkish Delight.</p>

<p>"Arnault is coming to dinner to-night, Mother."</p>

<p>"Really! The Turkish Delight is coming here to dinner? Shall I
provide anything special?"--Her voice sounded as if she would
suggest snails in aspic.</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>Virginia had seen a good deal of the Armenian at the office,
when she had to negotiate with him on behalf of the Board of
Trade. He was a man of about sixty, a merchant, had been a
millionaire, was ruined during the war, but was now coming on
again, and represented trade in Bulgaria. He wanted to negotiate
with the British Government, and the British Government sensibly
negotiated with him: at first through the medium of Virginia. Now
things were going satisfactorily between Monsieur Arnault, as
Virginia called him, and the Board of Trade, so that a sort of
friendship had followed the official relations.</p>

<p>The Turkish Delight was sixty, grey-haired and fat. He had
numerous grandchildren growing up in Bulgaria, but he was a
widower. He had a grey moustache cut like a brush, and glazed
brown eyes over which hung heavy lids with white lashes. His
manner was humble, but in his bearing there was a certain dogged
conceit. One notices the combination sometimes in Jews. He had
been very wealthy and kow-towed to, he had been ruined and
humiliated, terribly humiliated, and now, doggedly, he was rising
up again, his sons backing him, away in Bulgaria. One felt he was
not alone. He had his sons, his family, his tribe behind him,
away in the Near East.</p>

<p>He spoke bad English, but fairly fluent guttural French. He
did not speak much, but he sat. He sat, with his short, fat
thighs, as if for eternity, <i>there.</i> There was a strange
potency in his fat immobile sitting, as if his posterior were
connected with the very centre of the earth. And his brain,
spinning away at the one point in question, business, was very
agile. Business absorbed him. But not in a nervous, personal way.
Somehow the family, the tribe was always felt behind him. It was
business for the family, the tribe.</p>

<p>With the English he was humble, for the English like such
aliens to be humble, and he had had a long schooling from the
Turks. And he was always an outsider. Nobody would ever take any
notice of him in society. He would just be an outsider,
<i>sitting.</i></p>

<p>"I hope, Virginia, you won't ask that Turkish-carpet gentleman
when we have other people. <i>I</i> can bear it," said Mrs
Bodoin. "Some people might mind."</p>

<p>"Isn't it hard when you can't choose your own company in your
own house!" mocked Virginia.</p>

<p>"No! <i>I</i> don't care. I can meet anything; and I'm sure,
in the way of selling Turkish carpets, your acquaintance is very
good. But I don't suppose you look on him as a personal
friend--?"</p>

<p>"I do. I like him quite a lot."</p>

<p>"Well--! as you will. But consider your <i>other</i>
friends."</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin was really mortified this time. She looked on the
Armenian as one looks on the fat Levantine in a fez who tries to
sell one hideous tapestries at Port Said, or on the sea-front at
Nice, as being outside the class of human beings, and in the
class of insects. That he had been a millionaire, and might be a
millionaire again, only added venom to her feeling of disgust at
being forced into contact with such scum. She could not even
squash him, or annihilate him. In scum, there is nothing to
squash, for scum is only the unpleasant residue of that which was
never anything but squashed.</p>

<p>However, she was not quite just. True, he was fat, and he sat,
with short thighs, like a toad, as if seated for a toad's
eternity. His colour was of a dirty sort of paste, his black eyes
were glazed under heavy lids. And he never spoke until spoken to,
waiting in his toad's silence, like a slave.</p>

<p>But his thick, fine white hair, which stood up on his head
like a soft brush, was curiously virile. And his curious small
hands, of the same soft dull paste, had a peculiar, fat, soft
masculine breeding of their own. And his dull brown eye could
glint with the subtlety of serpents, under the white brush of
eyelash. He was tired, but he was not defeated. He had fought,
and won, and lost, and was fighting again, always at a
disadvantage. He belonged to a defeated race which accepts
defeat, but which gets its own back by cunning. He was the father
of sons, the head of a family, one of the heads of a defeated but
indestructible tribe. He was not alone, and so you could not lay
your finger on him. His whole consciousness was patriarchal and
tribal. And somehow, he was humble, but he was
indestructible.</p>

<p>At dinner he sat half-effaced, humble, yet with the conceit of
the humble. His manners were perfectly good, rather French.
Virginia chattered to him in French, and he replied with that
peculiar nonchalance of the boulevards, which was the only manner
he could command when speaking French. Mrs Bodoin understood, but
she was what one would call a heavy-footed linguist, so when she
said anything, it was intensely in English. And the Turkish
Delight replied in his clumsy English, hastily. It was not his
fault that French was being spoken. It was Virginia's.</p>

<p>He was very humble, conciliatory, with Mrs Bodoin. But he cast
at her sometimes that rapid glint of a reptilian glance as if to
say: Yes! I see you! You are a handsome figure. As an <i>objet de
vertu</i> you are almost perfect.--Thus his connoisseur's,
antique-dealer's eye would appraise her. But then his thick white
eyebrows would seem to add: But what, under holy Heaven, are you
as a woman? You are neither wife nor mother nor mistress, you
have no perfume of sex, you are more dreadful than a Turkish
soldier or an English official. No man on earth could embrace
you. You are a ghoul, you are a strange genie from the
underworld!--And he would secretly invoke the holy names, to
shield him.</p>

<p>Yet he was in love with Virginia. He saw, first and foremost,
the child in her, as if she were a lost child in the gutter, a
waif with a faint, fascinating cast in her brown eyes, waiting
till someone would pick her up. A fatherless waif! And he was
tribal father, father through all the ages.</p>

<p>Then, on the other hand, he knew her peculiar disinterested
cleverness in affairs. That, too, fascinated him: that odd,
almost second-sight cleverness about business, and entirely
impersonal, entirely in the air. It seemed to him very strange.
But it would be an immense help to him in his schemes. He did not
really understand the English. He was at sea with them. But with
her, he would have a clue to everything. For she was, finally,
quite a somebody among these English, these English
officials.</p>

<p>He was about sixty. His family was established, in the East,
his grandsons were growing up. It was necessary for him to live
in London, for some years. This girl would be useful. She had no
money, save what she would inherit from her mother. But he would
risk that: she would be an investment in his business. And then
the apartment. He liked the apartment extremely. He recognized
the <i>cachet,</i> and the lilies and swans of the Aubusson
carpet really did something to him. Virginia said to him: Mother
gave me the apartment.--So he looked on that as safe. And
finally, Virginia was almost a virgin, probably quite a virgin,
and, as far as the paternal oriental male like himself was
concerned, entirely virgin. He had a very small idea of the silly
puppy-sexuality of the English, so different from the prolonged
male voluptuousness of his own pleasures. And last of all, he was
physically lonely, getting old, and tired.</p>

<p>Virginia of course did not know why she liked being with
Arnault. Her cleverness was amazingly stupid when it came to
life, to living. She said he was "quaint". She said his
nonchalant French of the boulevards was "amusing". She found his
business cunning "intriguing", and the glint in his dark glazed
eyes, under the white, thick lashes, "sheiky". She saw him quite
often, had tea with him in his hotel, and motored with him one
day down to the sea.</p>

<p>When he took her hand in his own soft still hands, there was
something so caressing, so possessive in his touch, so strange
and positive in his leaning towards her, that though she trembled
with fear, she was helpless.--"But you are so thin, dear little
thin thing, you need repose, repose, for the blossom to open,
poor little blossom, to become a little fat!" he said in his
French.</p>

<p>She quivered, and was helpless. It certainly was quaint! He
was so strange and positive, he seemed to have all the power. The
moment he realized that she would succumb into his power, he took
full charge of the situation, he lost all his hesitation and his
humility. He did not want just to make love to her: he wanted to
marry her, for all his multifarious reasons. And he must make
himself master of her.</p>

<p>He put her hand to his lips, and seemed to draw her life to
his in kissing her thin hand. "The poor child is tired, she needs
repose, she needs to be caressed and cared for," he said in his
French. And he drew nearer to her.</p>

<p>She looked up in dread at his glinting, tired dark eyes under
the white lashes. But he used all his will, looking back at her
heavily and calculating that she must submit. And he brought his
body quite near to her, and put his hand softly on her face, and
made her lay her face against his breast, as he soothingly
stroked her arm with his other hand, "Dear little thing! dear
little thing! Arnault loves her so dearly! Arnault loves her!
Perhaps she will marry her Arnault. Dear little girl, Arnault
will put flowers in her life, and make her life perfumed with
sweetness and content."</p>

<p>She leaned against his breast and let him caress her. She gave
a fleeting, half poignant, half vindictive thought to her mother.
Then she felt in the air the sense of destiny, destiny. Oh so
nice, not to have to struggle. To give way to destiny.</p>

<p>"Will she marry her old Arnault? Eh? Will she marry him?" he
asked in a soothing, caressing voice, at the same time
compulsive.</p>

<p>She lifted her head and looked at him: the thick white brows,
the glinting, tired dark eyes. How queer and comic! How comic to
be in his power! And he was looking a little baffled.</p>

<p>"Shall I?" she said, with her mischievous twist of a grin.</p>

<p>"Mais oui!" he said, with all the sang froid of his old eyes.
"Mais oui! Je te contenterai, tu le verras."</p>

<p>"Tu me contenteras!" she said, with a flickering smile of real
amusement at his assurance. "Will you really content me?"</p>

<p>"But surely! I assure it you. And you will marry me?"</p>

<p>"You must tell mother," she said, and hid wickedly against his
waistcoat again, while the male pride triumphed in him.</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin had no idea that Virginia was intimate with the
Turkish Delight: she did not inquire into her daughter's
movements. During the famous dinner, she was calm and a little
aloof, but entirely self-possessed. When, after coffee, Virginia
left her alone with the Turkish Delight, she made no effort at
conversation, only glanced at the rather short, stout man in
correct dinner-jacket, and thought how his sort of fatness called
for a fez and the full muslin breeches of a bazaar merchant in
<i>The Thief of Baghdad.</i></p>

<p>"Do you really prefer to smoke a hookah?" she asked him, with
a slow drawl.</p>

<p>"What is a hookah, please?"</p>

<p>"One of those water-pipes. Don't you all smoke them, in the
East?"</p>

<p>He only looked mystified and humble, and silence resumed. She
little knew what was simmering inside his stillness.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, "I want to ask you something."</p>

<p>"You do? Then why not ask it?" came her slightly melancholy
drawl.</p>

<p>"Yes! It is this. I wish I may have the honour to marry your
daughter. She is willing."</p>

<p>There was a moment's blank pause. Then Mrs Bodoin leaned
towards him from her distance, with curious portentousness.</p>

<p>"What was that you said?" she asked. "Repeat it!"</p>

<p>"I wish I may have the honour to marry your daughter. She is
willing to take me."</p>

<p>His dark, glazed eyes looked at her, then glanced away again.
Still leaning forward, she gazed fixedly on him, as if
spellbound, turned to stone. She was wearing pink topaz
ornaments, but he judged they were paste, moderately good.</p>

<p>"Did I hear you say she is willing to take you?" came the
slow, melancholy, remote voice.</p>

<p>"Madame, I think so," he said, with a bow.</p>

<p>"I think we'll wait till she comes," she said, leaning
back.</p>

<p>There was silence. She stared at the ceiling. He looked
closely round the room, at the furniture, at the china in the
ivory-inlaid cabinet.</p>

<p>"I can settle five thousand pounds on Mademoiselle Virginia,
Madame," came his voice. "Am I correct to assume that she will
bring this apartment and its appointments into the marriage
settlement?"</p>

<p>Absolute silence. He might as well have been on the moon. But
he was a good sitter. He just sat until Virginia came in.</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin was still staring at the ceiling. The iron had
entered her soul finally and fully. Virginia glanced at her, but
said:</p>

<p>"Have a whisky-and-soda, Arnault?"</p>

<p>He rose and came towards the decanters, and stood beside her:
a rather squat, stout man with white head, silent with misgiving.
There was the fizz of the syphon: then they came to their
chairs.</p>

<p>"Arnault has spoken to you, Mother?" said Virginia.</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin sat up straight, and gazed at Virginia with big,
owlish eyes, haggard. Virginia was terrified, yet a little
thrilled. Her mother was beaten.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Virginia, that you are <i>willing</i> to marry
this--oriental gentleman?" asked Mrs Bodoin slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother, quite true," said Virginia, in her teasing soft
voice.</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin looked owlish and dazed.</p>

<p>"May I be excused from having any part in it, or from having
anything to do with your future <i>husband</i>--I mean having any
business to transact with him?" she asked dazedly, in her slow,
distinct voice.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" said Virginia, frightened, smiling
oddly.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then Mrs Bodoin, feeling old and haggard,
pulled herself together again.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that your future husband would like to
possess this apartment?" came her voice.</p>

<p>Virginia smiled quickly and crookedly. Arnault just sat,
planted on his posterior, and heard. She reposed on him.</p>

<p>"Well--perhaps!" said Virginia. "Perhaps he would like to know
that I possessed it." She looked at him.</p>

<p>Arnault nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"And do you <i>wish</i> to possess it?" came Mrs Bodoin's slow
voice. "If it your intention to <i>inhabit</i> it, with your
<i>husband</i>?" She put eternities into her long, stressed
words.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it is," said Virginia. "You know you <i>said</i>
the apartment was mine, Mother."</p>

<p>"Very well! It shall be so. I shall send my lawyer to
this--oriental gentleman, if you will leave written instructions
on my writing-table. May I ask when you think of
getting--<i>married</i>?"</p>

<p>"When do you think, Arnault?" said Virginia.</p>

<p>"Shall it be, in two weeks?" he said, sitting erect, with his
fists on his knees.</p>

<p>"In about a fortnight, Mother," said Virginia.</p>

<p>"I have heard! In two weeks! Very well! In two weeks
everything shall be at your disposal. And now, please excuse me."
She rose, made a slight general bow, and moved calmly and dimly
from the room. It was killing her, that she could not shriek
aloud and beat that Levantine out of the house. But she couldn't.
She had imposed the restraint on herself.</p>

<p>Arnault stood and looked with glistening eyes round the room.
It would be his. When his sons came to England, here he would
receive them.</p>

<p>He looked at Virginia. She too was white and haggard, now. And
she hung away from him, as if in resentment. She resented the
defeat of her mother. She was still capable of dismissing him for
ever, and going back to her mother.</p>

<p>"Your mother is a wonderful lady," he said, going to Virginia
and taking her hand. "But she has no husband to shelter her, she
is unfortunate. I am sorry she will be alone. I should be happy
if she would like to stay here with us."</p>

<p>The sly old fox knew what he was about.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's no hope of that," said Virginia, with a
return to her old irony.</p>

<p>She sat on the couch, and he caressed her softly and
paternally, and the very incongruity of it, there in her mother's
drawing-room, amused her. And because he saw that the things in
the drawing-room were handsome and valuable, and now they were
his, his blood flushed and he caressed the thin girl at his side
with passion, because she represented these valuable
surroundings, and brought them to his possession. And he said:
"And with me you will be very comfortable, very content, oh, I
shall make you content, not like Madame your mother. And you will
get fatter, and bloom like the rose. I shall make you bloom like
the rose. And shall we say next week, hein? Shall it be next
week, next Wednesday, that we marry? Wednesday is a good day.
Shall it be then?"</p>

<p>"Very well!" said Virginia, caressed again into a luxurious
sense of destiny, reposing on fate, having to make no effort, no
more effort, all her life.</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin moved into an hotel next day, and came into the
apartment to pack up and extricate herself and her immediate
personal belongings only when Virginia was necessarily absent.
She and her daughter communicated by letter, as far as was
necessary.</p>

<p>And in five days' time Mrs Bodoin was clear. All business that
could be settled was settled, all her trunks were removed. She
had five trunks, and that was all. Denuded and outcast, she would
depart to Paris, to live out the rest of her days.</p>

<p>The last day, she waited in the drawing-room till Virginia
should come home. She sat there in her hat and street things,
like a stranger.</p>

<p>"I just waited to say good-bye," she said. "I leave in the
morning for Paris. This is my address. I think everything is
settled; if not, let me know and I'll attend to it. Well,
good-bye!--and I hope you'll be <i>very happy</i>!"</p>

<p>She dragged out the last words sinisterly; which restored
Virginia, who was beginning to lose her head.</p>

<p>"Why, I think I may be," said Virginia, with the twist of a
smile.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Mrs Bodoin pointedly and grimly. "I
think the Armenian grandpapa knows very well what he's about.
You're just the harem type, after all." The words came slowly,
dropping, each with a plop! of deep contempt.</p>

<p>"I suppose I am! Rather fun!" said Virginia. "But I wonder
where I got it? Not from you, Mother--" she drawled
mischievously.</p>

<p>"I should say <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>"Perhaps daughters go by contraries, like dreams," mused
Virginia wickedly. "All the harem was left out of you, so perhaps
it all had to be put back into me."</p>

<p>Mrs Bodoin flashed a look at her.</p>

<p>"You have <i>all</i> my <i>pity</i>!" she said.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear. You have just a bit of mine."</p>

<p>"After all," she said, with a little laugh, "I can't see it
was so wonderful of you to hurry home to me, if you are so cross
when you do come."</p>

<p>"You would rather I stayed away?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>"You would rather I had stayed a day or two in Paris--or a
night or two."</p>

<p>She burst into a jeering "pouf!" of laughter.</p>

<p>"You!" she cried. "You and Parisian Nights' Entertainment!
What a fool you would look."</p>

<p>"Still," he said, "I could try."</p>

<p>"You <i>would</i>!" she mocked. "You would go dribbling up to
a woman. 'Please take me--my wife is so unkind to me!'"</p>

<p>He drank his tea in silence. They had been married a year.
They had married quickly, for love. And during the last three
months there had gone on almost continuously that battle between
them which so many married people fight, without knowing why. Now
it had begun again. He felt the physical sickness rising in him.
Somewhere down in his belly the big, feverish pulse began to
beat, where was the inflamed place caused by the conflict between
them.</p>

<p>She was a beautiful woman of about thirty, fair, luxuriant,
with proud shoulders and a face borne up by a fierce, native
vitality. Her green eyes had a curiously puzzled contraction just
now. She sat leaning on the table against the tea-tray, absorbed.
It was as if she battled with herself in him. Her green dress
reflected in the silver, against the red of the firelight.
Leaning abstractedly forward, she pulled some primroses from the
bowl, and threaded them at intervals in the plait which bound
round her head in the peasant fashion. So, with her little
starred fillet of flowers, there was something of the Gretchen
about her. But her eyes retained the curious half-smile.</p>

<p>Suddenly her face lowered gloomily. She sank her beautiful
arms, laying them on the table. Then she sat almost sullenly, as
if she would not give in. He was looking away out of the window.
With a quick movement she glanced down at her hands. She took off
her wedding-ring, reached to the bowl for a long flower-stalk,
and shook the ring glittering round and round upon it, regarding
the spinning gold, and spinning it as if she would spurn it. Yet
there was something about her of a fretful, naughty child as she
did so.</p>

<p>The man sat by the fire, tired, but tense. His body seemed so
utterly still because of the tension in which it was held. His
limbs, thin and vigorous, lay braced like a listening thing,
always vivid for action, yet held perfectly still. His face was
set and expressionless. The wife was all the time, in spite of
herself, conscious of him, as if the cheek that was turned
towards him had a sense which perceived him. They were both
rendered elemental, like impersonal forces, by the battle and the
suffering.</p>

<p>She rose and went to the window. Their flat was the fourth,
the top storey of a large house. Above the high-ridged, handsome
red roof opposite was an assembly of telegraph wires, a square,
squat framework, towards which hosts of wires sped from four
directions, arriving in darkly-stretched lines out of the white
sky. High up, at a great height, a seagull sailed. There was a
noise of traffic from the town beyond.</p>

<p>Then, from behind the ridge of the house-roof opposite a man
climbed up into the tower of wires, belted himself amid the
netted sky, and began to work, absorbedly. Another man,
half-hidden by the roof-ridge, stretched up to him with a wire.
The man in the sky reached down to receive it. The other, having
delivered, sank out of sight. The solitary man worked absorbedly.
Then he seemed drawn away from his task. He looked round almost
furtively, from his lonely height, the space pressing on him. His
eyes met those of the beautiful woman who stood in her
afternoon-gown, with flowers in her hair, at the window.</p>

<p>"I like you," she said, in her normal voice.</p>

<p>Her husband, in the room with her, looked round slowly and
asked:</p>

<p>"Whom do you like?"</p>

<p>Receiving no answer, he resumed his tense stillness.</p>

<p>She remained watching at the window, above the small, quiet
street of large houses. The man, suspended there in the sky,
looked across at her and she at him. The city was far below. Her
eyes and his met across the lofty space. Then, crouching together
again into his forgetfulness, he hid himself in his work. He
would not look again. Presently he climbed down, and the tower of
wires was empty against the sky.</p>

<p>The woman glanced at the little park at the end of the clear,
grey street. The diminished, dark-blue form of a soldier was seen
passing between the green stretches of grass, his spurs giving
the faintest glitter to his walk.</p>

<p>Then she turned hesitating from the window, as if drawn by her
husband. He was sitting still motionless, and detached from her,
hard; held absolutely away from her by his will. She wavered,
then went and crouched on the hearth-rug at his feet, laying her
head on his knee.</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid with me!" she pleaded, in a caressing,
languid, impersonal voice. He shut his teeth hard, and his lips
parted slightly with pain.</p>

<p>"You know you love me," she continued, in the same heavy,
sing-song way. He breathed hard, but kept still.</p>

<p>"Don't you?" she said, slowly, and she put her arms round his
waist, under his coat, drawing him to her. It was as if flames of
fire were running under his skin.</p>

<p>"I have never denied it," he said woodenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she pleaded, in the same heavy, toneless voice. "Yes.
You are always trying to deny it." She was rubbing her cheek
against his knee, softly. Then she gave a little laugh, and shook
her head. "But it's no good." She looked up at him. There was a
curious light in his eyes, of subtle victory. "It's no good, my
love, is it?"</p>

<p>His heart ran hot. He knew it was no good trying to deny he
loved her. But he saw her eyes, and his will remained set and
hard. She looked away into the fire.</p>

<p>"You hate it that you have to love me," she said, in a pensive
voice through which the triumph flickered faintly. "You hate it
that you love me--and it is petty and mean of you. You hate it
that you had to hurry back to me from Paris."</p>

<p>Her voice had become again quite impersonal, as if she were
talking to herself.</p>

<p>"At any rate," he said, "it is your triumph."</p>

<p>She gave a sudden, bitter-contemptuous laugh.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she said. "What is triumph to me, you fool! You can have
your triumph. I should be only too glad to give it you."</p>

<p>"And I to take it."</p>

<p>"Then take it," she cried, in hostility. "I offer it you often
enough."</p>

<p>"But you never mean to part with it."</p>

<p>"It is a lie. It is you, you, who are too paltry to take a
woman. How often do I fling myself at you--"</p>

<p>"Then don't--don't."</p>

<p>"Ha!--and if I don't--I get nothing out of you. Self! self!
that is all you are."</p>

<p>His face remained set and expressionless. She looked up at
him. Suddenly she drew him to her again, and hid her face against
him.</p>

<p>"Don't kick me off, Pietro, when I come to you," she
pleaded.</p>

<p>"You <i>don't</i> come to me," he answered stubbornly.</p>

<p>She lifted her head a few inches away from him and seemed to
listen, or to think.</p>

<p>"What do I do, then?" she asked, for the first time
quietly.</p>

<p>"You treat me as if I were a piece of cake, for you to eat
when you wanted."</p>

<p>She rose from him with a mocking cry of scorn, that yet had
something hollow in its sound.</p>

<p>"Treat you like a piece of cake, do I!" she cried. "I, who
have done all I have for you!"</p>

<p>There was a knock, and the maid entered with a telegram. He
tore it open.</p>

<p>"No answer," he said, and the maid softly closed the door.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is for you," he said, bitingly, rising and
handing her the slip of paper. She read it, laughed, then read it
again, aloud:</p>

<p>"'Meet me Marble Arch 7.30--theatre--Richard." Who is
Richard?" she asked, looking at her husband rather interested. He
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Nobody of mine," he said. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest notion," she said, flippantly.</p>

<p>"But," and his eyes went bullying, "you <i>must</i> know."</p>

<p>She suddenly became quiet, and jeering, took up his
challenge.</p>

<p>"Why must I know?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because it isn't for me, therefore it must be for you."</p>

<p>"And couldn't it be for anybody else?" she sneered.</p>

<p>"'Moest, 14 Merrilies Street,'" he read, decisively.</p>

<p>For a second she was puzzled into earnestness.</p>

<p>"Pah, you fool," she said, turning aside. "Think of your own
friends," and she flung the telegram away.</p>

<p>"It is not for me," he said, stiffly and finally.</p>

<p>"Then it is for the man in the moon--I should think <i>his</i>
name is Moest," she added, with a pouf of laughter against
him.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you know nothing about it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," she mocked, mouthing the words, and
sneering; "Yes, I do mean to say, poor little man."</p>

<p>He suddenly went hard with disgust.</p>

<p>"Then I simply don't believe you," he said coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh--don't you believe me!" she jeered, mocking the touch of
sententiousness in his voice. "What a calamity. The poor man
doesn't believe!"</p>

<p>"It couldn't possibly be any acquaintance of mine," he said
slowly.</p>

<p>"Then hold your tongue!" she cried harshly. "I've heard enough
of it."</p>

<p>He was silent, and soon she went out of the room. In a few
minutes he heard her in the drawing-room, improvising furiously.
It was a sound that maddened him: something yearning, yearning,
striving, and something perverse, that counteracted the yearning.
Her music was always working up towards a certain culmination,
but never reaching it, falling away in a jangle. How he hated it.
He lit a cigarette, and went across to the sideboard for a whisky
and soda. Then she began to sing. She had a good voice, but she
could not keep time. As a rule it made his heart warm with
tenderness for her, hearing her ramble through the songs in her
own fashion, making Brahms sound so different by altering his
time. But to-day he hated her for it. Why the devil couldn't she
submit to the natural laws of the stuff!</p>

<p>In about fifteen minutes she entered, laughing. She laughed as
she closed the door, and as she came to him where he sat.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "you silly thing, you silly thing! Aren't you
a stupid clown?"</p>

<p>She crouched between his knees and put her arms round him. She
was smiling into his face, her green eyes looking into his, were
bright and wide. But somewhere in them, as he looked back, was a
little twist that could not come loose to him, a little cast,
that was like an aversion from him, a strain of hate for him. The
hot waves of blood flushed over his body, and his heart seemed to
dissolve under her caresses. But at last, after many months, he
knew her well enough. He knew that curious little strain in her
eyes, which was waiting for him to submit to her, and then would
spurn him again. He resisted her while ever it was there.</p>

<p>"Why don't you let yourself love me?" she asked, pleading, but
a touch of mockery in her voice. His jaw set hard.</p>

<p>"Is it because you are afraid?"</p>

<p>He heard the slight sneer.</p>

<p>"Of what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Afraid to trust yourself?"</p>

<p>There was silence. It made him furious that she could sit
there caressing him and yet sneer at him.</p>

<p>"What <i>have</i> I done with myself?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Carefully saved yourself from giving all to me, for fear you
might lose something."</p>

<p>"Why should I lose anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>And they were both silent. She rose at last and went away from
him to get a cigarette. The silver box flashed red with firelight
in her hands. She struck a match, bungled, threw the stick aside,
lit another.</p>

<p>"What did you come running back for?" she asked, insolently,
talking with half-shut lips because of the cigarette. "I told you
I wanted peace. I've had none for a year. And for the last three
months you've done nothing but try to destroy me."</p>

<p>"You have not gone frail on it," he answered
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," she said, "I am ill inside me. I am sick of
you--sick. You make an eternal demand, and you give nothing back.
You leave one empty." She puffed the cigarette in feminine
fashion, then suddenly she struck her forehead with a wild
gesture. "I have a ghastly, empty feeling in my head," she said.
"I feel I simply <i>must</i> have rest--I must."</p>

<p>The rage went through his veins like flame.</p>

<p>"From your labours?" he asked, sarcastically, suppressing
himself.</p>

<p>"From you--from <i>you</i>?" she cried, thrusting forward her
head at him. "You, who use a woman's soul up, with your rotten
life. I suppose it is partly your health, and you can't help it,"
she added, more mildly. "But I simply can't stick it--I simply
can't, and that is all."</p>

<p>She shook her cigarette carelessly in the direction of the
fire. The ash fell on the beautiful Asiatic rug. She glanced at
it, but did not trouble. He sat, hard with rage.</p>

<p>"May I ask how I use you up, as you say?" he asked.</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, trying to get her feeling into words.
Then she shook her hand at him passionately, and took the
cigarette from her mouth.</p>

<p>"By--by following me about--by not leaving me <i>alone.</i>
You give me no peace--<i>I</i> don't know what you do, but it is
something ghastly."</p>

<p>Again the hard stroke of rage went down his mind.</p>

<p>"It is very vague," he said.</p>

<p>"I know," she cried. "I can't put it into words--but there it
is. You--you don't love. I pour myself out to you, and
then--there's nothing there--you simply aren't there."</p>

<p>He was silent for some time. His jaw set hard with fury and
hate.</p>

<p>"We have come to the incomprehensible," he said. "And now,
what about Richard?"</p>

<p>It had grown nearly dark in the room. She sat silent for a
moment. Then she took the cigarette from her mouth and looked at
it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to meet him," her voice, mocking, answered out of
the twilight.</p>

<p>His head went molten, and he could scarcely breathe.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" he asked, though he did not believe the affair to
be anything at all, even if there were a Richard.</p>

<p>"I'll introduce him to you when I know him a little better,"
she said. He waited.</p>

<p>"But who is he?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, I'll introduce him to you later."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Shall I come with you?"</p>

<p>"It would be like you," she answered, with a sneer.</p>

<p>The maid came in, softly, to draw the curtains and turn on the
light. The husband and wife sat silent.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, when the door was closed again, "you are
wanting a Richard for a rest?"</p>

<p>She took his sarcasm simply as a statement.</p>

<p>"I am," she said. "A simple, warm man who would love me
without all these reservation and difficulties. That is just what
I do want."</p>

<p>"Well, you have your own independence," he said.</p>

<p>"Ha," she laughed. "You needn't tell me that. It would take
more than you to rob me of my independence."</p>

<p>"I meant your own income," he answered quietly, while his
heart was plunging with bitterness and rage.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I will go and dress."</p>

<p>He remained without moving, in his chair. The pain of this was
almost too much. For some moments the great, inflamed pulse
struck through his body. It died gradually down, and he went
dull. He had not wanted to separate from her at this point of
their union; they would probably, if they parted in such a
crisis, never come together again. But if she insisted, well
then, it would have to be. He would go away for a month. He could
easily make business in Italy. And when he came back, they could
patch up some sort of domestic arrangement, as most other folk
had to do.</p>

<p>He felt full and heavy inside, and without the energy for
anything. The thought of having to pack and take a train to Milan
appalled him; it would mean such an effort of will. But it would
have to be done, and so he must do it. It was no use his waiting
at home. He might stay in town a night, at his brother-in-law's,
and go away the next day. It were better to give her a little
time to come to herself. She was really impulsive. And he did not
really want to go away from her.</p>

<p>He was still sitting thinking, when she came downstairs. She
was in costume and furs and toque. There was a radiant,
half-wistful, half-perverse look about her. She was a beautiful
woman, her bright, fair face set among the black furs.</p>

<p>"Will you give me some money?" she said. "There isn't
any."</p>

<p>He took two sovereigns, which she put in her little black
purse. She would go without a word of reconciliation. It made his
heart set hard again.</p>

<p>"You would like me to go away for a moment?" he said,
calmly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, stubbornly.</p>

<p>"All right, then, I will. I must stop in town for to-morrow,
but I will sleep at Edmund's."</p>

<p>"You could do that, couldn't you?" she said, accepting his
suggestion, a little bit hesitating.</p>

<p>"If you want me to."</p>

<p>"I'm so <i>tired</i>!" she lamented.</p>

<p>But there was exasperation and hate in the last word, too.</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered.</p>

<p>She finished buttoning her glove.</p>

<p>"You'll go, then?" she said suddenly, brightly, turning to
depart. "Good-bye."</p>

<p>He hated her for the flippant insult of her leave-taking.</p>

<p>"I shall be at Edmund's to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>"You will write to me from Italy, won't you?"</p>

<p>He would not answer the unnecessary question.</p>

<p>"Have you taken the dead primroses out of your hair?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I haven't," she said.</p>

<p>And she unpinned her hat.</p>

<p>"Richard <i>would</i> think me cracked," she said, picking out
the crumpled, creamy fragments. She strewed the withered flowers
carelessly on the table, set her hat straight.</p>

<p>"Do you <i>want</i> me to go?" he asked, again, rather
yearning.</p>

<p>She knitted her brows. It irked her to resist the appeal. Yet
she had in her breast a hard, repellent feeling for him. She had
loved him, too. She had loved him dearly. And--he had not seemed
to realise her. So that now she <i>did</i> want to be free of him
for a while. Yet the love, the passion she had had for him clung
about her. But she did want, first and primarily, to be free of
him again.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, half pleading.</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered.</p>

<p>She came across to him, and put her arms round his neck. Her
hatpin caught his head, but he moved, and she did not notice.</p>

<p>"You don't mind very much, do you, my love?" she said
caressingly.</p>

<p>"I mind all the world, and all I am," he said.</p>

<p>She rose from him, fretted, miserable, and yet determined.</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> have some rest," she repeated.</p>

<p>He knew that cry. She had had it, on occasions, for two months
now. He had cursed her, and refused either to go away or to let
her go. Now he knew it was no use.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Go and get it from Richard."</p>

<p>"Yes." She hesitated. "Good-bye," she called, and was
gone.</p>

<p>He heard her cab whirr away. He had no idea whither she was
gone--but probably to Madge, her friend.</p>

<p>He went upstairs to pack. Their bedroom made him suffer. She
used to say, at first, that she would give up anything rather
than her sleeping with him. And still they were always together.
A kind of blind helplessness drove them to one another, even
when, after he had taken her, they only felt more apart than
ever. It had seemed to her that he had been mechanical and barren
with her. She felt a horrible feeling of aversion from him,
inside her, even while physically she still desired him. His body
had always a kind of fascination for her. But had hers for him?
He seemed, often, just to have served her, or to have obeyed some
impersonal instinct for which she was the only outlet, in his
loving her. So at last she rose against him, to cast him off. He
seemed to follow her so, to draw her life into his. It made her
feel she would go mad. For he seemed to do it just blindly,
without having any notion of her herself. It was as if she were
sucked out of herself by some non-human force. As for him, he
seemed only like an instrument for his work, his business, not
like a person at all. Sometimes she thought he was a big
fountain-pen which was always sucking at her blood for ink.</p>

<p>He could not understand anything of this. He loved her--he
could not bear to be away from her. He tried to realise her and
to give her what she wanted. But he could not understand. He
could not understand her accusations against him. Physically, he
knew, she loved him, or had loved him, and was satisfied by him.
He also knew that she would have loved another man nearly as
well. And for the rest, he was only himself. He could not
understand what she said about his using her and giving her
nothing in return. Perhaps he did not think of her, as a separate
person from himself, sufficiently. But then he did not see, he
could not see that she had any real personal life, separate from
himself. He tried to think of her in every possible way, and to
give her what she wanted. But it was no good; she was never at
peace. And lately there had been growing a breach between them.
They had never come together without his realising it,
afterwards. Now he must submit, and go away.</p>

<p>And her quilted dressing-gown--it was a little bit torn, like
most of her things--and her pearl-backed mirror, with one of the
pieces of pearl missing--all her untidy, flimsy, lovable things
hurt him as he went about the bedroom, and made his heart go hard
with hate, in the midst of his love.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">II</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Instead of going to his brother-in-law's, he went to an hotel
for the night. It was not till he stood in the lift, with the
attendant at his side, that he began to realise that he was only
a mile or so away from his own home, and yet farther away than
any miles could make him. It was about nine o'clock. He hated his
bedroom. It was comfortable, and not ostentatious; its only fault
was the neutrality necessary to an hotel apartment. He looked
round. There was one semi-erotic Florentine picture of a lady
with cat's eyes, over the bed. It was not bad. The only other
ornament on the walls was the notice of hours and prices of meals
and rooms. The couch sat correctly before the correct little
table, on which the writing-sachet and ink-stand stood
mechanically. Down below, the quiet street was half illuminated,
the people passed sparsely, like stunted shadows. And of all
times of the night, it was a quarter-past nine. He thought he
would go to bed. Then he looked at the white-and-glazed doors
which shut him off from the bath. He would bath, to pass the time
away. In the bath-closet everything was so comfortable and white
and warm--too warm; the level, unvarying heat of the atmosphere,
from which there was no escape anywhere, seemed so hideously
hotel-like; this central-heating forced a unity into the great
building, making it more than ever like an enormous box with
incubating cells. He loathed it. But at any rate the bath-closet
was human, white and business-like and luxurious.</p>

<p>He was trying, with the voluptuous warm water, and the
exciting thrill of the shower-bath, to bring back the life into
his dazed body. Since she had begun to hate him, he had gradually
lost that physical pride and pleasure in his own physique which
the first months of married life had given him. His body had gone
meaningless to him again, almost as if it were not there. It had
wakened up, there had been the physical glow and satisfaction
about his movements of a creature which rejoices in itself; a
glow which comes on a man who loves and is loved passionately and
successfully. Now this was going again. All the life was
accumulating in his mental consciousness, and his body felt like
a piece of waste. He was not aware of this. It was instinct which
made him want to bathe. But that, too, was a failure. He went
under the shower-spray with his mind occupied by business, or
some care of affairs, taking the tingling water almost without
knowing it, stepping out mechanically, as a man going through a
barren routine. He was dry again, and looking out of the window,
without having experienced anything during the last hour.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that she did not know his address. He
scribbled a note and rang to have it posted.</p>

<p>As soon as he had turned out the light, and there was nothing
left for his mental consciousness to flourish amongst, it
dropped, and it was dark inside him as without. It was his blood,
and the elemental male in it, that now rose from him; unknown
instincts suffocated him, and he could not bear it, that he was
shut in this great, warm building. He wanted to be outside, with
space springing from him. But, again, the reasonable being in him
knew it was ridiculous, and he remained staring at the dark,
having the horrible sensation of a roof low down over him; whilst
that dark, unknown being, which lived below all his consciousness
in the eternal gloom of his blood, heaved and raged blindly
against him.</p>

<p>It was not his thoughts that represented him. They spun like
straws or the iridescence of oil on a dark stream. He thought of
her, sketchily, spending an evening of light amusement with the
symbolical Richard. That did not mean much to him. He did not
really speculate about Richard. He had the dark, powerful sense
of her, how she wanted to get away from him and from the deep,
underneath intimacy which had gradually come between them, back
to the easy, everyday life where one knows nothing of the
underneath, so that it takes its way apart from the
consciousness. She did not want to have the deeper part of
herself in direct contact with or under the influence of any
other intrinsic being. She wanted, in the deepest sense, to be
free of him. She could not bear the close, basic intimacy into
which she had been drawn. She wanted her life for herself. It was
true, her strongest desire had been previously to know the
contact through the whole of her being, down to the very bottom.
Now it troubled her. She wanted to disengage his roots. Above, in
the open, she would live. But she must live perfectly free of
herself, and not, at her source, be connected with anybody. She
was using this symbolical Richard as a spade to dig him away from
her. And he felt like a thing whose roots are all straining on
their hold, and whose elemental life, that blind source, surges
backwards and forwards darkly, in a chaos, like something which
is threatened with spilling out of its own vessel.</p>

<p>This tremendous swaying of the most elemental part of him
continued through the hours, accomplishing his being, whilst
superficially he thought of the journey, of the Italian he would
speak, how he had left his coat in the train, and the rascally
official interpreter had tried to give him twenty lire for a
sovereign--how the man in the hat-shop in the Strand had given
him the wrong change--of the new shape in hats, and the new
felt--and so on. Underneath it all, like the sea under a pleasure
pier, his elemental, physical soul was heaving in great waves
through his blood and his tissue, the sob, the silent lift, the
slightly-washing fall away again. So his blood, out of whose
darkness everything rose, being moved to its depth by her
revulsion, heaved and swung towards its own rest, surging blindly
to its own re-settling.</p>

<p>Without knowing it, he suffered that night almost more than he
had ever suffered during his life. But it was all below his
consciousness. It was his life itself at storm, not his mind and
his will engaged at all.</p>

<p>In the morning he got up, thin and quiet, without much
movement anywhere, only with some of the clearing afterstorm. His
body felt like a clean, empty shell. His mind was limpidly clear.
He went through the business of the toilet with a certain
accuracy, and at breakfast, in the restaurant, there was about
him that air of neutral correctness which makes men seem so
unreal.</p>

<p>At lunch, there was a telegram for him. It was like her to
telegraph.</p>

<p>"Come to tea, my dear love."</p>

<p>As he read it, there was a great heave of resistance in him.
But then he faltered. With his consciousness, he remembered how
impulsive and eager she was when she dashed off her telegram, and
he relaxed. It went without saying that he would go.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">III</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When he stood in the lift going up to his own flat, he was
almost blind with the hurt of it all. They had loved each other
so much in his first home. The parlour-maid opened to him, and he
smiled at her affectionately. In the golden-brown and
cream-coloured hall--Paula would have nothing heavy or sombre
about her--a bush of rose-coloured azaleas shone, and a little
tub of lilies twinkled na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>She did not come out to meet him.</p>

<p>"Tea is in the drawing-room," the maid said, and he went in
while she was hanging up his coat. It was a big room, with a
sense of space, and a spread of whity carpet almost the colour of
unpolished marble--and grey and pink border; of pink roses on big
white cushions, pretty Dresden china, and deep chintz-covered
chairs and sofas which looked as if they were used freely. It was
a room where one could roll in soft, fresh-comfort, a room which
had not much breakable in it, and which seemed, in the dusky
spring evening, fuller of light than the streets outside.</p>

<p>Paula rose, looking queenly and rather radiant, as she held
out her hand. A young man whom Peter scarcely noticed rose on the
other side of the hearth.</p>

<p>"I expected you an hour ago," she said, looking into her
husband's eyes. But though she looked at him, she did not see
him. And he sank his head.</p>

<p>"This is another Moest," she said, presenting the stranger.
"He knows Richard, too."</p>

<p>The young man, a German of about thirty, with a clean-shaven
&aelig;sthetic face, long black hair brushed back a little
wearily or bewildered from his brow, and inclined to fall in an
odd loose strand again, so that he nervously put it back with his
fine hand, looked at Moest and bowed. He had a finely-cut face,
but his dark-blue eyes were strained, as if he did not quite know
where he was. He sat down again, and his pleasant figure took a
self-conscious attitude, of a man whose business it was to say
things that should be listened to. He was not conceited or
affected--naturally sensitive and rather na&iuml;ve; but he could
only move in an atmosphere of literature and literary ideas; yet
he seemed to know there was something else, vaguely, and he felt
rather at a loss. He waited for the conversation to move his way,
as, inert, an insect waits for the sun to set it flying.</p>

<p>"Another Moest," Paula was pronouncing emphatically. "Actually
another Moest, of whom we have never heard, and under the same
roof with us."</p>

<p>The stranger laughed, his lips moving nervously over his
teeth.</p>

<p>"You are in this house?" Peter asked, surprised.</p>

<p>The young man shifted in his chair, dropped his head, looked
up again.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, meeting Moest's eyes as if he were somewhat
dazzled. "I am staying with the Lauriers, on the second
floor."</p>

<p>He spoke English slowly, with a quaint, musical quality in his
voice, and a certain rhythmic enunciation.</p>

<p>"I see; and the telegram was for you?" said the host.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the stranger, with a nervous little laugh.</p>

<p>"My husband," broke in Paula, evidently repeating to the
German what she had said before, for Peter's benefit this time,
"was quite convinced I had an <i>affaire</i>"--she pronounced it
in the French fashion--"with this terrible Richard."</p>

<p>The German gave his little laugh, and moved, painfully
self-conscious, in his chair.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, glancing at Moest.</p>

<p>"Did you spend a night of virtuous indignation?" Paula laughed
to her husband, "imagining my perfidy?"</p>

<p>"I did not," said her husband. "Were you at Madge's?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. Then, turning to her guest: "Who is Richard,
Mr. Moest?"</p>

<p>"Richard," began the German, word by word, "is my cousin." He
glanced quickly at Paula, to see if he were understood. She
rustled her skirts, and arranged herself comfortably, lying, or
almost squatting, on the sofa by the fire. "He lives in
Hampstead."</p>

<p>"And what is he like?" she asked, with eager interest.</p>

<p>The German gave his little laugh. Then he moved his fingers
across his brow, in his dazed fashion. Then he looked, with his
beautiful blue eyes, at his beautiful hostess.</p>

<p>"I--" He laughed again nervously. "He is a man whose
parts--are not very much--very well known to me. You see," he
broke forth, and it was evident he was now conversing to an
imaginary audience--"I cannot easily express myself in English.
I--I never have talked it. I shall speak, because I know nothing
of modern England, a kind of Renaissance English."</p>

<p>"How lovely!" cried Paula. "But if you would rather, speak
German. We shall understand sufficiently."</p>

<p>"I would rather hear some Renaissance English," said
Moest.</p>

<p>Paula was quite happy with the new stranger. She listened to
descriptions of Richard, shifting animatedly on her sofa. She
wore a new dress, of a rich red-tile colour, glossy and long and
soft, and she had threaded daisies, like buttons, in the braided
plait of her hair. Her husband hated her for these familiarities.
But she was beautiful too, and warm-hearted. Only, through all
her warmth and kindliness, lay, he said, at the bottom, an almost
feline selfishness, a coldness.</p>

<p>She was playing to the stranger--nay, she was not playing, she
was really occupied by him. The young man was the favourite
disciple of the most famous present-day German poet and
<i>Meister.</i> He himself was occupied in translating
Shakespeare. Having been always a poetic disciple, he had never
come into touch with life save through literature, and for him,
since he was a rather fine-hearted young man, with a human need
to live, this was a tragedy. Paula was not long in discovering
what ailed him, and she was eager to come to his rescue.</p>

<p>It pleased her, nevertheless, to have her husband sitting by,
watching her. She forgot to give tea to anyone. Moest and the
German both helped themselves, and the former attended also to
his wife's cup. He sat rather in the background, listening, and
waiting. She had made a fool of him with her talk to this
stranger of "Richard"; lightly and flippantly she had made a fool
of him. He minded, but was used to it. Now she had absorbed
herself in this dazed, starved, literature-bewildered young
German, who was, moreover, really lovable, evidently a gentleman.
And she was seeing in him her mission--"just as", said Moest
bitterly to himself, "she saw her mission in me, a year ago. She
is no woman. She's got a big heart for everybody, but it must be
like a common-room; she's got no private, sacred heart, except
perhaps for herself, where there's no room for a man in it."</p>

<p>At length the stranger rose to go, promising to come
again.</p>

<p>"Isn't he adorable?" cried Paula, as her husband returned to
the drawing-room. "I think he is simply adorable."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Moest.</p>

<p>"He called this morning to ask about the telegram. But, poor
devil, isn't it a shame what they've done to him?"</p>

<p>"What who have done to him?" her husband asked coldly,
jealous.</p>

<p>"Those literary creatures. They take a young fellow like that,
and stick him up among the literary gods, like a mantelpiece
ornament, and there he has to sit, being a minor ornament, while
all his youth is gone. It is criminal."</p>

<p>"He should get off the mantelpiece, then," said Moest.</p>

<p>But inside him his heart was black with rage against her. What
had she, after all, to do with this young man, when he himself
was being smashed up by her? He loathed her pity and her
kindliness, which was like a charitable institution. There was no
core to the woman. She was full of generosity and bigness and
kindness, but there was no heart in her, no security, no place
for one single man. He began to understand now sirens and
sphinxes and the other Greek fabulous female things. They had not
been created by fancy, but out of bitter necessity of the man's
human heart to express itself.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she laughed, half contemptuous. "Did <i>you</i> get off
your miserable, starved isolation by yourself?--you didn't. You
had to be fetched down, and I had to do it."</p>

<p>"Out of your usual charity," he said.</p>

<p>"But you can sneer at another man's difficulties," she
said.</p>

<p>"Your name ought to be Panacea, not Paula," he replied.</p>

<p>He felt furious and dead against her. He could even look at
her without the tenderness coming. And he was glad. He hated her.
She seemed unaware. Very well; let her be so.</p>

<p>"Oh, but he makes me so miserable, to see him!" she cried.
"Self-conscious, can't get into contact with anybody, living a
false literary life like a man who takes poetry as a drug.--One
<i>ought</i> to help him."</p>

<p>She was really earnest and distressed.</p>

<p>"Out of the frying-pan into the fire," he said.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be in the fire any day, than in a frying-pan," she
said, abstractedly, with a little shudder. She never troubled to
see the meaning of her husband's sarcasms.</p>

<p>They remained silent. The maid came in for the tray, and to
ask him if he would be in to dinner. He waited for his wife to
answer. She sat with her chin in her hands, brooding over the
young German, and did not hear. The rage flashed up in his heart.
He would have liked to smash her out of this false
absorption.</p>

<p>"No," he said to the maid. "I think not. Are you at home for
dinner, Paula?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>And he knew by her tone, easy and abstracted, that she
intended him to stay, too. But she did not trouble to say
anything.</p>

<p>At last, after some time, she asked:</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing--went to bed early," he replied.</p>

<p>"Did you sleep well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you."</p>

<p>And he recognised the ludicrous civilities of married people,
and he wanted to go. She was silent for a time. Then she asked,
and her voice had gone still and grave:</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask me what I did?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't care--you just went to somebody's for
dinner."</p>

<p>"Why don't you care what I do? Isn't it your place to
care?"</p>

<p>"About the things you do to spite me?--no!"</p>

<p>"Ha!" she mocked. "I did nothing to spite you. I was in deadly
earnest."</p>

<p>"Even with your Richard?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried. "There <i>might</i> have been a Richard.
What did you care!"</p>

<p>"In that case you'd have been a liar and worse, so why should
I care about you then?"</p>

<p>"You <i>don't</i> care about me," she said, sullenly.</p>

<p>"You say what you please," he answered.</p>

<p>She was silent for some time.</p>

<p>"And did you do absolutely nothing last night?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I had a bath and went to bed."</p>

<p>Then she pondered.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you don't care for me."</p>

<p>He did not trouble to answer. Softly, a little china clock
rang six.</p>

<p>"I shall go to Italy in the morning," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And," he said, slowly, forcing the words out, "I shall stay
at the Aquila Nera at Milan--you know my address."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>"I shall be away about a month. Meanwhile you can rest."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, in her throat, with a little contempt of him
and his stiffness. He, in spite of himself, was breathing
heavily. He knew that this parting was the real separation of
their souls, marked the point beyond which they could go no
farther, but accepted the marriage as a comparative failure. And
he had built all his life on his marriage. She accused him of not
loving her. He gripped the arms of his chair. Was there something
in it? Did he only want the attributes which went along with her,
the peace of heart which a man has in living to one woman, even
if the love between them be not complete; the singleness and
unity in his life that made it easy; the fixed establishment of
himself as a married man with a home; the feeling that he
belonged somewhere, that one woman existed--not was paid but
<i>existed</i>--really to take care of him; was it these things
he wanted, and not her? But he wanted her for these
purposes--her, and nobody else. But was that not enough for her?
Perhaps he wronged her--it was possible. What she said against
him was in earnest. And what she said in earnest he had to
believe, in the long run, since it was the utterance of her
being. He felt miserable and tired.</p>

<p>When he looked at her, across the gathering twilight of the
room, she was staring into the fire and biting her finger-nail,
restlessly, restlessly, without knowing. And all his limbs went
suddenly weak, as he realised that she suffered too, that
something was gnawing at her. Something in the look of her, the
crouching, dogged, wondering look made him faint with tenderness
for her.</p>

<p>"Don't bite your finger-nails," he said quietly, and,
obediently, she took her hand from her mouth. His heart was
beating quickly. He could feel the atmosphere of the room
changing. It had stood aloof, the room, like something placed
round him, like a great box. Now everything got softer, as if it
partook of the atmosphere, of which he partook himself, and they
were all one.</p>

<p>His mind reverted to her accusations, and his heart beat like
a caged thing against what he could not understand. She said he
did not love her. But he knew that in his way, he did. In his
way--but was his way wrong? His way was himself, he thought,
struggling. Was there something wrong, something missing in his
nature, that he could not love? He struggled, as if he were in a
mesh, and could not get out. He did not want to believe that he
was deficient in his nature. Wherein was he deficient? It was
nothing physical. She said he would not come out of himself, that
he was no good to her, because he could not get outside himself.
What did she mean? Not outside himself! It seemed like some
acrobatic feat, some slippery, contortionist trick. No, he could
not understand. His heart flashed hot with resentment. She did
nothing but find fault with him. What did she care about him,
really, when she could taunt him with not being able to take a
light woman when he was in Paris? Though his heart, forced to do
her justice, knew that for this she loved him, really.</p>

<p>But it was too complicated and difficult, and already, as they
sat thinking, it had gone wrong between them and things felt
twisted, horribly twisted, so that he could not breathe. He must
go. He could dine at the hotel and go to the theatre.</p>

<p>"Well," he said casually, "I must go. I think I shall go and
see The 'Black Sheep'."</p>

<p>She did not answer. Then she turned and looked at him with a
queer, half-bewildered, half-perverse smile that seemed conscious
of pain. Her eyes, shining rather dilated and triumphant, and yet
with something heavily yearning behind them, looked at him. He
could not understand, and, between her appeal and her defiant
triumph, he felt as if his chest was crushed so that he could not
breathe.</p>

<p>"My love," she said, in a little singing, abstract fashion,
her lips somehow sipping towards him, her eyes shining dilated;
and yet he felt as if he were not in it, himself.</p>

<p>His heart was a flame that prevented his breathing. He gripped
the chair like a man who is going to be put under torture.</p>

<p>"What?" he said, staring back at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, my love!" she said softly, with a little, intense laugh
on her face, that made him pant. And she slipped from her sofa
and came across to him quickly, and put her hand hesitating on
his hair. The blood struck like flame across his consciousness,
and the hurt was keen like joy, like the releasing of something
that hurts as the pressure is relaxed and the movement comes,
before the peace. Afraid, his fingers touched her hand, and she
sank swiftly between his knees, and put her face on his breast.
He held her head hard against his chest, and again and again the
flame went down his blood, as he felt her round, small, nut of a
head between his hands pressing into his chest where the hurt had
been bruised in so deep. His wrists quivered as he pressed her
head to him, as he felt the deadness going out of him; the real
life released, flowing into his body again. How hard he had shut
it off, against her, when she hated him. He was breathing heavily
with relief, blindly pressing her head against him. He believed
in her again.</p>

<p>She looked up, laughing, childish, inviting him with her lips.
He bent to kiss her, and as his eyes closed, he saw hers were
shut. The feeling of restoration was almost unbearable.</p>

<p>"Do you love me?" she whispered, in a little ecstasy.</p>

<p>He did not answer, except with the quick tightening of his
arms, clutching her a little closer against him. And he loved the
silkiness of her hair, and its natural scent. And it hurt him
that the daisies she had threaded in should begin to wither. He
resented their hurting her by their dying.</p>

<p>He had not understood. But the trouble had gone off. He was
quiet, and he watched her from out of his sensitive stillness, a
little bit dimly, unable to recover. She was loving to him,
protective, and bright, laughing like a glad child too.</p>

<p>"We must tell Maud I shall be in to dinner," he said.</p>

<p>That was like him--always aware of the practical side of the
case, and the appearances. She laughed a little bit ironically.
Why should she have to take her arm from round him, just to tell
Maud he would be in to dinner?</p>

<p>"I'll go," she said.</p>

<p>He drew the curtains and turned on the light in the big lamp
that stood in a corner. The room was dim, and palely warm. He
loved it dearly.</p>

<p>His wife, when she came back, as soon as she had closed the
door, lifted her arms to him in a little ecstasy, coming to him.
They clasped each other closer, body to body. And the intensity
of his feeling was so fierce, he felt himself going dim, fusing
into something soft and plastic between her hands. And this
connection with her was bigger than life or death. And at the
bottom of his heart was a sob.</p>

<p>She was gay and winsome at the dinner. Like lovers, they were
just deliciously waiting for the night to come up. But there
remained in him always the slightly broken feeling which the
night before had left.</p>

<p>"And you won't go to Italy," she said, as if it were an
understood thing.</p>

<p>She gave him the best things to eat, and was solicitous for
his welfare--which was not usual with her. It gave him deep, shy
pleasure. He remembered a verse she was often quoting as one she
loved. He did not know it for himself:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"On my breasts I warm thy foot-soles;<br>
 Wine I pour, and dress thy meats;<br>
 Humbly, when my lord disposes,<br>
 Lie with him on perfumed sheets."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>She said it to him sometimes, looking up at him from the
pillow. But it never seemed real to him. She might, in her sudden
passion, put his feet between her breasts. But he never felt like
a lord, never more pained and insignificant than at those times.
As a little girl, she must have subjected herself before her
dolls. And he was something like her lordliest plaything. He
liked that too. If only . . .</p>

<p>Then, seeing some frightened little way of looking at him
which she had, the pure pain came back. He loved her, and it
would never be peace between them; she would never belong to him,
as a wife. She would take him and reject him, like a mistress.
And perhaps for that reason he would love her all the more; it
might be so.</p>

<p>But then, he forgot. Whatever was or was not, now she loved
him. And whatever came after, this evening he was the lord. What
matter if he were deposed to-morrow, and she hated him!</p>

<p>Her eyes, wide and candid, were staring at him a little bit
wondering, a little bit forlorn. She knew he had not quite come
back. He held her close to him.</p>

<p>"My love," she murmured consolingly. "My love."</p>

<p>And she put her fingers through his hair, arranging it in
little, loose curves, playing with it and forgetting everything
else. He loved that dearly, to feel the light lift and
touch--touch of her finger-tips making his hair, as she said,
like an Apollo's. She lifted his face to see how he looked, and,
with a little laugh of love, kissed him. And he loved to be made
much of by her. But he had the dim, hurting sense that she would
not love him to-morrow, that it was only her great need to love
that exalted him to-night. He <i>knew</i> he was no king; he did
not feel a king, even when she was crowning and kissing him.</p>

<p>"Do you love me?" she asked, playfully whispering.</p>

<p>He held her fast and kissed her, while the blood hurt in his
heart-chambers.</p>

<p>"You know," he answered, with a struggle.</p>

<p>Later, when he lay holding her with a passion intense like
pain, the words blurted from him:</p>

<p>"Flesh of my flesh. Paula!--Will you--?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my love," she answered consolingly.</p>

<p>He bit his mouth with pain. For him it was almost an agony of
appeal.</p>

<p>"But, Paula--I mean it--flesh of my flesh--a wife?"</p>

<p>She tightened her arms round him without answering. And he
knew, and she knew, that she put him off like that.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">IV</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Two months later, she was writing to him in Italy: "Your idea
of your woman is that she is an expansion, no, a <i>rib</i> of
yourself, without any existence of her own. That I am a being by
myself is more than you can grasp. I wish I could absolutely
submerge myself in a man--and <i>so I do.</i> I <i>always</i>
loved you . . .</p>

<p>"You will say 'I was patient.' Do you call that patient,
hanging on for your needs, as you have done? The innermost life
you have <i>always</i> had of me, and you held yourself aloof
because you were afraid.</p>

<p>"The unpardonable thing was you told me you loved me.--Your
<i>feelings</i> have hated me these three months, which did not
prevent you from taking my love and every breath from
me.--Underneath you undermined me, in some subtle, corrupt way
that I did not see because I believed you, when you told me you
loved me . . .</p>

<p>"The insult of the way you took me these last three months I
shall never forgive you. I honestly <i>did</i> give myself, and
always in vain and rebuffed. The strain of it all has driven me
quite mad.</p>

<p>"You say I am a trag&eacute;dienne, but I don't do any of your
perverse undermining tricks. You are always luring one into the
open like a clever enemy, but you keep safely under cover all the
time.</p>

<p>"This practically means, for me, that life is over, my belief
in life--I hope it will recover, but it never could do so with
you . . ."</p>

<p>To which he answered: "If I kept under cover it is funny, for
there isn't any cover now.--And you can hope, pretty easily, for
your own recovery apart from me. For my side, without you, I am
done . . . But you lie to yourself. You <i>wouldn't</i> love
<i>me</i>, and you won't be able to love anybody else--except
yourself."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s06">RAWDON'S ROOF</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Rawdon was the sort of man who said, privately, to his men
friends, over a glass of wine after dinner: "No woman shall sleep
again under my roof!"</p>

<p>He said it with pride, rather vaunting, pursing his lips.
"Even my housekeeper goes home to sleep."</p>

<p>But the housekeeper was a gentle old thing of about sixty, so
it seemed a little fantastic. Moreover, the man had a wife, of
whom he was secretly rather proud, as a piece of fine property,
and with whom he kept up a very witty correspondence, epistolary,
and whom he treated with humorous gallantry when they
occasionally met for half an hour. Also he had a love affair
going on. At least, if it wasn't a love affair, what was it?
However!</p>

<p>"No, I've come to the determination that no woman shall ever
sleep under my roof again--not even a female cat!"</p>

<p>One looked at the roof, and wondered what it had done amiss.
Besides, it wasn't his roof. He only rented the house. What does
a man mean, anyhow, when he says "my roof"? <i>My</i> roof! The
only roof I am conscious of having, myself, is the top of my
head. However, he hardly can have meant that no woman should
sleep under the elegant dome of his skull. Though there's no
telling. You see the top of a sleek head through a window, and
you say: "By Jove, what a pretty girl's head!" And after all,
when the individual comes out, it's in trousers.</p>

<p>The point, however, is that Rawdon said so emphatically--no,
not emphatically, succinctly: "No woman shall ever again sleep
under my roof." It was a case of futurity. No doubt he had had
his ceilings whitewashed, and their memories put out. Or rather,
repainted, for it was a handsome wooden ceiling. Anyhow, if
ceilings have eyes, as walls have ears, then Rawdon had given his
ceilings a new outlook, with a new coat of paint, and all memory
of any woman's having slept under them--for after all, in decent
circumstances we sleep under ceilings, not under roofs--was wiped
out for ever.</p>

<p>"And will you neither sleep under any woman's roof?"</p>

<p>That pulled him up rather short. He was not prepared to sauce
his gander as he had sauced his goose. Even I could see the
thought flitting through his mind, that some of his pleasantest
holidays depended on the charm of his hostess. Even some of the
nicest hotels were run by women.</p>

<p>"Ah! Well! That's not quite the same thing, you know. When one
leaves one's own house one gives up the keys of circumstance, so
to speak. But, as far as possible, I make it a rule not to sleep
under a roof that is openly, and obviously, and obtrusively a
woman's roof!"</p>

<p>"Quite!" said I with a shudder. "So do I!"</p>

<p>Now I understood his mysterious love affair less than ever. He
was never known to speak of this love affair: he did not even
write about it to his wife. The lady--for she was a lady--lived
only five minutes' walk from Rawdon. She had a husband, but he
was in diplomatic service or something like that, which kept him
occupied in the sufficiently-far distance. Yes, far enough. And,
as a husband, he was a complete diplomat. A balance of power. If
he was entitled to occupy the wide field of the world, she, the
other and contrasting power, might concentrate and consolidate
her position at home.</p>

<p>She was a charming woman, too, and even a beautiful woman. She
had two charming children, long-legged, stalky,
clove-pink-half-opened sort of children. But really charming. And
she was a woman with a certain mystery. She never talked. She
never said anything about herself. Perhaps she suffered; perhaps
she was frightfully happy, and made <i>that</i> her cause for
silence. Perhaps she was wise enough even to be beautifully
silent about her happiness. Certainly she never mentioned her
sufferings, or even her trials: and certainly she must have a
fair handful of the latter, for Alec Drummond sometimes fled home
in the teeth of a gale of debts. He simply got through his own
money and through hers, and, third and fatal stride, through
other people's as well. Then something had to be done about it.
And Janet, dear soul, had to put her hat on and take journeys.
But she never said anything of it. At least, she did just hint
that Alec didn't <i>quite</i> make enough money to meet expenses.
But after all, we don't go about with our eyes shut, and Alec
Drummond, whatever else he did, didn't hide his prowess under a
bushel.</p>

<p>Rawdon and he were quite friendly, but really! None of them
ever talked. Drummond didn't talk, he just went off and behaved
in his own way. And though Rawdon would chat away till the small
hours, <i>he</i> never "talked". Not to his nearest male friend
did he ever mention Janet save as a very pleasant woman and his
neighbour: he admitted he adored her children. They often came to
see him.</p>

<p>And one felt about Rawdon, he was making a mystery of
something. And that was rather irritating. He went every day to
see Janet, and of course we saw him going: going or coming. How
can one help but see? But he always went in the morning, at about
eleven, and did not stay for lunch: or he went in the afternoon,
and came home to dinner. Apparently he was never there in the
evening. Poor Janet, she lived like a widow.</p>

<p>Very well, if Rawdon wanted to make it so blatantly obvious
that it was only platonic, purely platonic, why wasn't he
natural? Why didn't he say simply: "I'm very fond of Janet
Drummond, she is my very dear friend?" Why did he sort of curl up
at the very mention of her name, and curdle into silence: or else
say rather forcedly: "Yes, she is a charming woman. I see a good
deal of her, but chiefly for the children's sake. I'm devoted to
the children!" Then he would look at one in such a curious way,
as if he were hiding something. And after all, what was there to
hide? If he was the woman's friend, why not? It could be a
charming friendship. And if he were her lover, why, heaven bless
me, he ought to have been proud of it, and showed just a glint,
just an honest man's glint.</p>

<p>But no, never a glint of pride or pleasure in the relation
either way. Instead of that, this rather theatrical reserve.
Janet, it is true, was just as reserved. If she could, she
avoided mentioning his name. Yet one knew, sure as houses, she
felt something. One suspected her of being more in love with
Rawdon than ever she had been with Alec. And one felt that there
was a hush put upon it all. She had had a hush put upon her. By
whom? By both the men? Or by Rawdon only? Or by Drummond? Was it
for her husband's sake? Impossible! For her children's? But why!
Her children were devoted to Rawdon.</p>

<p>It had now become the custom for them to go to him three times
a week, for music. I don't mean he taught them the piano. Rawdon
was a very refined musical amateur. He had them sing, in their
delicate girlish voices, delicate little songs, and really he
succeeded wonderfully with them; he made them so true, which
children rarely are, musically, and so pure and effortless, like
little flamelets of sound. It really was rather beautiful, and
sweet of him. And he taught them <i>music</i>, the delicacy of
the feel of it. They had a regular teacher for the practice.</p>

<p>Even the little girls, in their young little ways, were in
love with Rawdon! So if their mother were in love too, in her
ripened womanhood, why not?</p>

<p>Poor Janet! She was so still, and so elusive: the hush upon
her! She was rather like a half-opened rose that somebody had
tied a string round, so that it couldn't open any more. But why?
Why? In her there was a real touch of mystery. One could never
<i>ask</i> her, because one knew her heart was too keenly
involved: or her pride.</p>

<p>Whereas there was, really, no mystery about Rawdon, refined
and handsome and subtle as he was. He <i>had</i> no mystery: at
least, to a man. What <i>he</i> wrapped himself up in was a
certain amount of mystification.</p>

<p>Who wouldn't be irritated to hear a fellow saying, when for
months and months he has been paying a daily visit to a lonely
and very attractive woman--nay, lately even a twice-daily visit,
even if always before sundown--to hear him say, pursing his lips
after a sip of his own very moderate port: "I've taken a vow that
no woman shall sleep under my roof again!"</p>

<p>I almost snapped out: "Oh, what the hell! And what about your
Janet?" But I remembered in time, it was not <i>my</i> affair,
and if he wanted to have his mystifications, let him have
them.</p>

<p>If he meant he wouldn't have his wife sleep under his roof
again, that one could understand. They were really very witty
with one another, he and she, but fatally and damnably
married.</p>

<p>Yet neither wanted a divorce. And neither put the slightest
claim to any control over the other's behaviour. He said: "Women
live on the moon, men on the earth." And she said: "I don't mind
in the least if he loves Janet Drummond, poor thing. It would be
a change for him, from loving himself. And a change for her, if
somebody loved her--"</p>

<p>Poor Janet! But he wouldn't have her sleep under his roof, no,
not for any money. And apparently he never slept under hers--if
she could be said to have one. So what the deuce?</p>

<p>Of course, if they were friends, just friends, all right! But
then in that case, why start talking about not having a woman
sleep under your roof? Pure mystification!</p>

<p>The cat never came out of the bag. But one evening I
distinctly heard it mewing inside its sack, and I even believe I
saw a claw through the canvas.</p>

<p>It was in November--everything much as usual--myself pricking
my ears to hear if the rain had stopped, and I could go home,
because I was just a little bored about "cornemuse" music. I had
been having dinner with Rawdon, and listening to him ever since
on his favourite topic: not, of course, women, and why they
shouldn't sleep under his roof, but fourteenth-century melody and
windbag accompaniment.</p>

<p>It was not late--not yet ten o'clock--but I was restless, and
wanted to go home. There was no longer any sound of rain. And
Rawdon was perhaps going to make a pause in his monologue.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a tap at the door, and Rawdon's man,
Hawken, edged in. Rawdon, who had been a major in some fantastic
capacity during the war, had brought Hawken back with him. This
fresh-faced man of about thirty-five appeared in the doorway with
an intensely blank and bewildered look on his face. He was really
an extraordinarily good actor.</p>

<p>"A lady, sir!" he said, with a look of utter blankness.</p>

<p>"A what?" snapped Rawdon.</p>

<p>"A lady!"--then with a most discreet drop in his voice: "Mrs.
Drummond, sir!" He looked modestly down at his feet.</p>

<p>Rawdon went deathly white, and his lips quivered.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Drummond! Where?"</p>

<p>Hawken lifted his eyes to his master in a fleeting glance.</p>

<p>"I showed her into the dining-room, there being no fire in the
drawing-room."</p>

<p>Rawdon got to his feet and took two or three agitated strides.
He could not make up his mind. At last he said, his lips working
with agitation:</p>

<p>"Bring her in here."</p>

<p>Then he turned with a theatrical gesture to me.</p>

<p>"What this is all about, I <i>don't</i> know," he said.</p>

<p>"Let me clear out," said I, making for the door.</p>

<p>He caught me by the arm.</p>

<p>"No, for God's sake! For God's sake, stop and see me
through!"</p>

<p>He gripped my arm till it really hurt, and his eyes were quite
wild. I did not know my Olympic Rawdon.</p>

<p>Hastily I backed away to the side of the fire--we were in
Rawdon's room, where the books and piano were--and Mrs. Drummond
appeared in the doorway. She was much paler than usual, being a
rather warm-coloured woman, and she glanced at me with big
reproachful eyes, as much as to say: You intruder! You
interloper! For my part, I could do nothing but stare. She wore a
black wrap, which I knew quite well, over her black
dinner-dress.</p>

<p>"Rawdon!" she said, turning to him and blotting out my
existence from her consciousness. Hawken softly closed the door,
and I could <i>feel</i> him standing on the threshold outside,
listening keen as a hawk.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Janet," said Rawdon, with a grimace of a sour
smile, which he could not get rid of once he had started it, so
that his face looked very odd indeed, like a mask which he was
unable either to fit on or take off. He had several conflicting
expressions all at once, and they had all stuck.</p>

<p>She let her wrap slip back on her shoulders, and knitted her
white fingers against her skirt, pressing down her arms, and
gazing at him with a terrible gaze. I began to creep to the
door.</p>

<p>Rawdon started after me.</p>

<p>"No, don't go! Don't go! I specially want you not to go," he
said in extreme agitation.</p>

<p>I looked at her. She was looking at him with a heavy, sombre
kind of stare. Me she absolutely ignored. Not for a second could
she forgive me for existing on the earth. I slunk back to my post
behind the leather armchair, as if hiding.</p>

<p>"Do sit down, Janet," he said to her again. "And have a smoke.
What will you drink?"</p>

<p>"Nothanks!" she said, as if it were one word slurred out.
"Nothanks."</p>

<p>And she proceeded again to fix him with that heavy, portentous
stare.</p>

<p>He offered her a cigarette, his hand trembling as he held out
the silver box.</p>

<p>"Nothanks!" she slurred out again, not even looking at the
box, but keeping him fixed with that dark and heavy stare.</p>

<p>He turned away, making a great delay lighting a cigarette,
with his back to her, to get out of the stream of that stare. He
carefully went for an ash-tray, and put it carefully within
reach--all the time trying not to be swept away on that stare.
And she stood with her fingers locked, her straight, plump,
handsome arms pressed downwards against her skirt, and she gazed
at him.</p>

<p>He leaned his elbow on the mantelpiece abstractedly for a
moment--then he started suddenly, and rang the bell. She turned
her eyes from him for a moment, to watch his middle finger
pressing the bell-button. Then there was a tension of waiting, an
interruption in the previous tension. We waited. Nobody came.
Rawdon rang again.</p>

<p>"That's very curious!" he murmured to himself. Hawken was
usually so prompt. Hawken, not being a woman, slept under the
roof, so there was no excuse for his not answering the bell. The
tension in the room had now changed quality, owing to this new
suspense. Poor Janet's sombre stare became gradually loosened, so
to speak. Attention was divided. Where was Hawken? Rawdon rang
the bell a third time, a long peal. And now Janet was no longer
the centre of suspense. Where was Hawken? The question loomed
large over every other.</p>

<p>"I'll just look in the kitchen," said I, making for the
door.</p>

<p>"No, no. I'll go," said Rawdon.</p>

<p>But I was in the passage--and Rawdon was on my heels. The
kitchen was very tidy and cheerful, but empty; only a bottle of
beer and two glasses stood on the table. To Rawdon the kitchen
was as strange a world as to me--he never entered the servants'
quarters. But to me it was curious that the bottle of beer was
empty, and both the glasses had been used. I knew Rawdon wouldn't
notice.</p>

<p>"That's very curious!" said Rawdon: meaning the absence of his
man.</p>

<p>At that moment we heard a step on the servants' stairs, and
Rawdon opened the door to reveal Hawken descending with an armful
of sheets and things.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Why!--" and a pause. "I was airing the clean laundry,
like--not to waste the fire last thing."</p>

<p>Hawken descended into the kitchen with a very flushed face and
very bright eyes and rather ruffled hair, and proceeded to spread
the linen on chairs before the fire.</p>

<p>"I hope I've not done wrong, sir," he said in his most winning
manner. "Was you ringing?"</p>

<p>"Three times! Leave that linen and bring a bottle of the
fizz."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir. You can't hear the bell from the front,
sir."</p>

<p>It was perfectly true. The house was small, but it had been
built for a very nervous author, and the servants' quarters were
shut off, padded from the rest of the house.</p>

<p>Rawdon said no more about the sheets and things, but he looked
more peaked than ever.</p>

<p>We went back to the music-room. Janet had gone to the hearth,
and stood with her hand on the mantel. She looked round at us,
baffled.</p>

<p>"We're having a bottle of fizz," said Rawdon. "Do let me take
your wrap."</p>

<p>"And where was Hawken?" she asked satirically.</p>

<p>"Oh, busy somewhere upstairs."</p>

<p>"He's a busy young man, that!" she said sardonically. And she
sat uncomfortably on the edge of the chair where I had been
sitting.</p>

<p>When Hawken came with the tray, she said:</p>

<p>"I'm not going to drink."</p>

<p>Rawdon appealed to me, so I took a glass. She looked
inquiringly at the flushed and bright-eyed Hawken, as if she
understood something.</p>

<p>The manservant left the room. We drank our wine, and the
awkwardness returned.</p>

<p>"Rawdon!" she said suddenly, as if she were firing a revolver
at him. "Alec came home to-night in a bigger mess than ever, and
wanted to make love to me to get it off his mind. I can't stand
it any more. I'm in love with you, and I simply can't stand Alec
getting too near to me. He's dangerous when he's crossed--and
when he's worked up. So I just came here. I didn't see what else
I could do."</p>

<p>She left off as suddenly as a machine-gun leaves off firing.
We were just dazed.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," Rawdon began, in a vague and neutral
tone. . . .</p>

<p>"I am, am I not?" she said eagerly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," he said. "I'll go round to the
hotel to-night, and you can stay here."</p>

<p>"Under the kindly protection of Hawken, you mean!" she said,
with quiet sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Why!--I could send Mrs. Betts, I suppose," he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Betts was his housekeeper.</p>

<p>"You couldn't stay and protect me yourself?" she said
quietly.</p>

<p>"I! I! Why, I've made a vow--haven't I, Joe?"--he turned to
me--"not to have any woman sleep under my roof again."--He got
the mixed sour smile on his face.</p>

<p>She looked up at the ceiling for a moment, then lapsed into
silence. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Sort of monastery, so to speak!"</p>

<p>And she rose and reached for her wrap, adding:</p>

<p>"I'd better go, then."</p>

<p>"Joe will see you home," he said.</p>

<p>She faced round on me.</p>

<p>"Do you mind <i>not</i> seeing me home, Mr. Bradley?" she
said, gazing at me.</p>

<p>"Not if you don't want me," said I.</p>

<p>"Hawken will drive you," said Rawdon.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he won't!" she said. "I'll walk. Good-night."</p>

<p>"I'll get my hat," stammered Rawdon, in an agony. "Wait! Wait!
The gate will be locked."</p>

<p>"It was open when I came," she said.</p>

<p>He rang for Hawken to unlock the iron doors at the end of the
short drive, whilst he himself huddled into a greatcoat and
scarf, fumbling for a flashlight.</p>

<p>"You won't go till I come back, will you?" he pleaded to me.
"I'd be awfully glad if you'd stay the night. The sheets
<i>will</i> be aired."</p>

<p>I had to promise--and he set off with an umbrella, in the
rain, at the same time asking Hawken to take a flashlight and go
in front. So that was how they went, in single file along the
path over the fields to Mrs. Drummond's house, Hawken in front,
with flashlight and umbrella, curving round to light up in front
of Mrs. Drummond, who, with umbrella only, walked isolated
between two lights, Rawdon shining his flashlight on her from the
rear from under his umbrella. I turned indoors.</p>

<p>So that was over! At least, for the moment!</p>

<p>I thought I would go upstairs and see how damp the bed in the
guest-chamber was before I actually stayed the night with Rawdon.
He never had guests--preferred to go away himself.</p>

<p>The guest-chamber was a good room across a passage and round a
corner from Rawdon's room--its door just opposite the padded
service-door. This latter service-door stood open, and a light
shone through. I went into the spare bedroom, switching on the
light.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the bed looked as if it had just been
left--the sheets tumbled, the pillows pressed. I put in my hands
under the bedclothes, and it was warm. Very curious!</p>

<p>As I stood looking round in mild wonder, I heard a voice call
softly: "Joe!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said I instinctively, and, though startled, strode at
once out of the room and through the servants' door, towards the
voice. Light shone from the open doorway of one of the servants'
rooms.</p>

<p>There was a muffled little shriek, and I was standing looking
into what was probably Hawken's bedroom, and seeing a soft and
pretty white leg and a pretty feminine posterior very thinly
dimmed in a rather short night-dress, just in the act of climbing
into a narrow little bed, and, then arrested, the owner of the
pretty posterior burying her face in the bed-clothes, to be
invisible, like the ostrich in the sand.</p>

<p>I discreetly withdrew, went downstairs and poured myself a
glass of wine. And very shortly Rawdon returned looking like
Hamlet in the last act.</p>

<p>He said nothing, neither did I. We sat and merely smoked. Only
as he was seeing me upstairs to bed, in the now immaculate
bedroom, he said pathetically:</p>

<p>"Why aren't women content to be what a man wants them to
be?"</p>

<p>"Why aren't they!" said I wearily.</p>

<p>"I thought I had made everything clear," he said.</p>

<p>"You start at the wrong end," said I.</p>

<p>And as I said it, the picture came into my mind of the pretty
feminine butt-end in Hawken's bedroom. Yes, Hawken made better
starts, wherever he ended.</p>

<p>When he brought me my cup of tea in the morning, he was very
soft and cat-like. I asked him what sort of day it was, and he
asked me if I'd had a good night, and was I comfortable.</p>

<p>"Very comfortable!" said I. "But I turned you out, I'm
afraid."</p>

<p>"Me, sir?" He turned on me a face of utter bewilderment.</p>

<p>But I looked him in the eye.</p>

<p>"Is your name Joe?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"You're right, sir."</p>

<p>"So is mine," said I. "However, I didn't see her face, so it's
all right. I suppose you <i>were</i> a bit tight, in that little
bed!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir!" and he flashed me a smile of amazing impudence,
and lowered his tone to utter confidence. "This is the best bed
in the house, this is." And he touched it softly.</p>

<p>"You've not tried them all, surely?"</p>

<p>A look of indignant horror on his face!</p>

<p>"No, sir, indeed I haven't."</p>

<p>That day, Rawdon left for London, on his way to Tunis, and
Hawken was to follow him. The roof of his house looked just the
same.</p>

<p>The Drummonds moved too--went away somewhere, and left a lot
of unsatisfied tradespeople behind.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="s07">STRIKE-PAY</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Strike-money is paid in the Primitive Methodist Chapel. The
crier was round quite early on Wednesday morning to say that
paying would begin at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>The Primitive Methodist Chapel is a big barn of a place,
built, designed, and paid for by the colliers themselves. But it
threatened to fall down from its first form, so that a
professional architect had to be hired at last to pull the place
together.</p>

<p>It stands in the Square. Forty years ago, when Bryan and
Wentworth opened their pits, they put up the "squares" of miners'
dwellings. They are two great quadrangles of houses, enclosing a
barren stretch of ground, littered with broken pots and rubbish,
which forms a square, a great, sloping, lumpy playground for the
children, a drying-ground for many women's washing.</p>

<p>Wednesday is still wash-day with some women. As the men
clustered round the Chapel, they heard the thud-thud-thud of many
pouches, women pounding away at the wash-tub with a wooden
pestle. In the Square the white clothes were waving in the wind
from a maze of clothes-lines, and here and there women were
pegging out, calling to the miners, or to the children who dodged
under the flapping sheets.</p>

<p>Ben Townsend, the Union agent, has a bad way of paying. He
takes the men in order of his round, and calls them by name. A
big, oratorical man with a grey beard, he sat at the table in the
Primitive school-room, calling name after name. The room was
crowded with colliers, and a great group pushed up outside. There
was much confusion. Ben dodged from the Scargill Street list to
the Queen Street. For this Queen Street men were not prepared.
They were not to the fore.</p>

<p>"Joseph Grooby--Joseph Grooby! Now, Joe, where are you?"</p>

<p>"Hold on a bit, Sorry!" cried Joe from outside. "I'm shovin'
up."</p>

<p>There was a great noise from the men.</p>

<p>"I'm takin' Queen Street. All you Queen Street men should be
ready. Here you are, Joe," said the Union agent loudly.</p>

<p>"Five children!" said Joe, counting the money
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"That's right, I think," came the mouthing voice. "Fifteen
shillings, is it not?"</p>

<p>"A bob a kid," said the collier.</p>

<p>"Thomas Sedgwick--How are you, Tom? Missis better?"</p>

<p>"Ay, 'er's shapin' nicely. Tha'rt hard at work to-day, Ben."
This was sarcasm on the idleness of a man who had given up the
pit to become a Union agent.</p>

<p>"Yes. I rose at four to fetch the money."</p>

<p>"Dunna hurt thysen," was the retort, and the men laughed.</p>

<p>"No--John Merfin!"</p>

<p>But the colliers, tired with waiting, excited by the strike
spirit, began to rag. Merfin was young and dandiacal. He was
choir-master at the Wesleyan Chapel.</p>

<p>"Does your collar cut, John?" asked a sarcastic voice out of
the crowd.</p>

<p>"Hymn Number Nine.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Diddle-diddle dumpling, my son John<br>
 Went to bed with his best suit on,'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>came the solemn announcement.</p>

<p>Mr. Merfin, his white cuffs down to his knuckles, picked up
his half-sovereign, and walked away loftily.</p>

<p>"Sam Coutts!" cried the paymaster.</p>

<p>"Now, lad, reckon it up," shouted the voice of the crowd,
delighted.</p>

<p>Mr. Coutts was a straight-backed ne'er-do-well. He looked at
his twelve shillings sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Another two-bob--he had twins a-Monday night--get thy money,
Sam, tha's earned it--tha's addled it, Sam; dunna go be-out it.
Let him ha' the two bob for 'is twins, mister," came the clamour
from the men around.</p>

<p>Sam Coutts stood grinning awkwardly.</p>

<p>"You should ha' given us notice, Sam," said the paymaster
suavely. "We can make it all right for you next week--"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, nay," shouted a voice. "Pay on delivery--the goods
is there right enough."</p>

<p>"Get thy money, Sam, tha's addled it," became the universal
cry, and the Union agent had to hand over another florin, to
prevent a disturbance. Sam Coutts grinned with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Good shot, Sam," the men exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Ephraim Wharmby," shouted the pay-man.</p>

<p>A lad came forward.</p>

<p>"Gi' him sixpence for what's on t'road," said a sly voice.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," replied Ben Townsend; "pay on delivery."</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter. The miners were in high
spirits.</p>

<p>In the town they stood about in gangs, talking and laughing.
Many sat on their heels in the market-place. In and out of the
public-houses they went, and on every bar the half-sovereigns
clicked.</p>

<p>"Comin' ter Nottingham wi' us, Ephraim?" said Sam Coutts to
the slender, pale young fellow of about twenty-two.</p>

<p>"I'm non walkin' that far of a gleamy day like this."</p>

<p>"He has na got the strength," said somebody, and a laugh went
up.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked another pertinent voice.</p>

<p>"He's a married man, mind yer," said Chris Smitheringale, "an'
it ta'es a bit o' keepin' up."</p>

<p>The youth was teased in this manner for some time.</p>

<p>"Come on ter Nottingham wi's; tha'll be safe for a bit," said
Coutts.</p>

<p>A gang set off, although it was only eleven o'clock. It was a
nine-mile walk. The road was crowded with colliers travelling on
foot to see the match between Notts and Aston Villa. In Ephraim's
gang were Sam Coutts, with his fine shoulders and his extra
florin, Chris Smitheringale, fat and smiling, and John Wharmby, a
remarkable man, tall, erect as a soldier, black-haired and proud;
he could play any musical instrument, he declared.</p>

<p>"I can play owt from a comb up'ards. If there's music to be
got outer a thing, I back I'll get it. No matter what shape or
form of instrument you set before me, it doesn't signify if I
nivir clapped eyes on it before, I's warrant I'll have a tune out
of it in five minutes."</p>

<p>He beguiled the first two miles so. It was true, he had caused
a sensation by introducing the mandoline into the townlet,
filling the hearts of his fellow-colliers with pride as he sat on
the platform in evening dress, a fine soldierly man, bowing his
black head, and scratching the mewing mandoline with hands that
had only to grasp the "instrument" to crush it entirely.</p>

<p>Chris stood a can round at the "White Bull" at Gilt Brook.
John Wharmby took his turn at Kimberley top.</p>

<p>"We wunna drink again," they decided, "till we're at Cinder
Hill. We'll non stop i' Nuttall."</p>

<p>They swung along the high-road under the budding trees. In
Nuttall churchyard the crocuses blazed with yellow at the brim of
the balanced, black yews. White and purple crocuses dipt up over
the graves, as if the churchyard were bursting out in tiny
tongues of flame.</p>

<p>"Sithee," said Ephraim, who was an ostler down pit, "sithee,
here comes the Colonel. Sithee at his 'osses how they pick their
toes up, the beauties!"</p>

<p>The Colonel drove past the men, who took no notice of him.</p>

<p>"Hast heard, Sorry," said Sam, "as they're com'n out i'
Germany, by the thousand, an' begun riotin'?"</p>

<p>"An' comin' out i' France simbitar," cried Chris.</p>

<p>The men all gave a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Sorry," shouted John Wharmby, much elated, "we oughtna ter go
back under a twenty per cent rise."</p>

<p>"We should get it," said Chris.</p>

<p>"An' easy! They can do nowt bi-out us, we'n on'y ter stop out
long enough."</p>

<p>"I'm willin'," said Sam, and there was a laugh. The colliers
looked at one another. A thrill went through them as if an
electric current passed.</p>

<p>"We'n on'y ter stick out, an' we s'll see who's gaffer."</p>

<p>"Us!" cried Sam. "Why, what can they do again' us, if we come
out all over th' world?"</p>

<p>"Nowt!" said John Wharmby. "Th' mesters is bobbin' about like
corks on a cassivoy a'ready." There was a large natural
reservoir, like a lake, near Bestwood, and this supplied the
simile.</p>

<p>Again there passed through the men that wave of elation,
quickening their pulses. They chuckled in their throats. Beyond
all consciousness was this sense of battle and triumph in the
hearts of the working-men at this juncture.</p>

<p>It was suddenly suggested at Nuttall that they should go over
the fields to Bulwell, and into Nottingham that way. They went
single file across the fallow, past the wood, and over the
railway, where now no trains were running. Two fields away was a
troop of pit ponies. Of all colours, but chiefly of red or brown,
they clustered thick in the field, scarcely moving, and the two
lines of trodden earth patches showed where fodder was placed
down the field.</p>

<p>"Theer's the pit 'osses," said Sam. "Let's run 'em."</p>

<p>"It's like a circus turned out. See them skewbawd 'uns--seven
skewbawd," said Ephraim.</p>

<p>The ponies were inert, unused to freedom. Occasionally one
walked round. But there they stood, two thick lines of ruddy
brown and piebald and white, across the trampled field. It was a
beautiful day, mild, pale blue, a "growing day", as the men said,
when there was the silence of swelling sap everywhere.</p>

<p>"Let's ha'e a ride," said Ephraim.</p>

<p>The younger men went up to the horses.</p>

<p>"Come on--co-oop, Taffy--co-oop, Ginger."</p>

<p>The horses tossed away. But having got over the excitement of
being above-ground, the animals were feeling dazed and rather
dreary. They missed the warmth and the life of the pit. They
looked as if life were a blank to them.</p>

<p>Ephraim and Sam caught a couple of steeds, on whose backs they
went careering round, driving the rest of the sluggish herd from
end to end of the field. The horses were good specimens, on the
whole, and in fine condition. But they were out of their
element.</p>

<p>Performing too clever a feat, Ephraim went rolling from his
mount. He was soon up again, chasing his horse. Again he was
thrown. Then the men proceeded on their way.</p>

<p>They were drawing near to miserable Bulwell, when Ephraim,
remembering his turn was coming to stand drinks, felt in his
pocket for his beloved half-sovereign, his strike-pay. It was not
there. Through all his pockets he went, his heart sinking like
lead.</p>

<p>"Sam," he said, "I believe I'n lost that ha'ef a
sovereign."</p>

<p>"Tha's got it somewheer about thee," said Chris.</p>

<p>They made him take off his coat and waistcoat. Chris examined
the coat, Sam the waistcoat, whilst Ephraim searched his
trousers.</p>

<p>"Well," said Chris, "I'n foraged this coat, an' it's non
theer."</p>

<p>"An' I'll back my life as th' on'y bit a metal on this
wa'scoat is the buttons," said Sam.</p>

<p>"An' it's non in my breeches," said Ephraim. He took off his
boots and his stockings. The half-sovereign was not there. He had
not another coin in his possession.</p>

<p>"Well," said Chris, "we mun go back an' look for it."</p>

<p>Back they went, four serious-hearted colliers, and searched
the field, but in vain.</p>

<p>"Well," said Chris, "we s'll ha'e ter share wi' thee, that's
a'."</p>

<p>"I'm willin'," said John Wharmby.</p>

<p>"An' me," said Sam.</p>

<p>"Two bob each," said Chris.</p>

<p>Ephraim, who was in the depths of despair, shamefully accepted
their six shillings.</p>

<p>In Bulwell they called in a small public-house, which had one
long room with a brick floor, scrubbed benches and scrubbed
tables. The central space was open. The place was full of
colliers, who were drinking. There was a great deal of drinking
during the strike, but not a vast amount drunk. Two men were
playing skittles, and the rest were betting. The seconds sat on
either side the skittle-board, holding caps of money, sixpences
and coppers, the wagers of the "backers".</p>

<p>Sam, Chris, and John Wharmby immediately put money on the man
who had their favour. In the end Sam declared himself willing to
play against the victor. He was the Bestwood champion. Chris and
John Wharmby backed him heavily, and even Ephraim the Unhappy
ventured sixpence.</p>

<p>In the end, Sam had won half a crown, with which he promptly
stood drinks and bread and cheese for his comrades. At half-past
one they set off again.</p>

<p>It was a good match between Notts and Villa--no goals at
half-time, two-none for Notts at the finish. The colliers were
hugely delighted, especially as Flint, the forward for Notts, who
was an Underwood man well known to the four comrades, did some
handsome work, putting the two goals through.</p>

<p>Ephraim determined to go home as soon as the match was over.
He knew John Wharmby would be playing the piano at the "Punch
Bowl", and Sam, who had a good tenor voice, singing, while Chris
cut in with witticisms, until evening. So he bade them farewell,
as he must get home. They, finding him somewhat of a damper on
their spirits, let him go.</p>

<p>He was the sadder for having witnessed an accident near the
football-ground. A navvy, working at some drainage, carting an
iron tip-tub of mud and emptying it, had got with his horse on to
the deep deposit of ooze which was crusted over. The crust had
broken, the man had gone under the horse, and it was some time
before the people had realised he had vanished. When they found
his feet sticking out, and hauled him forth, he was dead, stifled
dead in the mud. The horse was at length hauled out, after having
its neck nearly pulled from the socket.</p>

<p>Ephraim went home vaguely impressed with a sense of death, and
loss, and strife. Death was loss greater than his own, the strike
was a battle greater than that he would presently have to
fight.</p>

<p>He arrived home at seven o'clock, just when it had fallen
dark. He lived in Queen Street with his young wife, to whom he
had been married two months, and with his mother-in-law, a widow
of sixty-four. Maud was the last child remaining unmarried, the
last of eleven.</p>

<p>Ephraim went up the entry. The light was burning in the
kitchen. His mother-in-law was a big, erect woman, with wrinkled,
loose face, and cold blue eyes. His wife was also large, with
very vigorous fair hair, frizzy like unravelled rope. She had a
quiet way of stepping, a certain cat-like stealth, in spite of
her large build. She was five months pregnant.</p>

<p>"Might we ask wheer you've been to?" inquired Mrs. Marriott,
very erect, very dangerous. She was only polite when she was very
angry.</p>

<p>"I' bin ter th' match."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the mother-in-law. "And why couldn't we be
told as you thought of jaunting off?"</p>

<p>"I didna know mysen," he answered, sticking to his broad
Derbyshire.</p>

<p>"I suppose it popped into your mind, an' so you darted off,"
said the mother-in-law dangerously.</p>

<p>"I didna. It wor Chris Smitheringale who exed me."</p>

<p>"An' did you take much invitin'?"</p>

<p>"I didna want ter goo."</p>

<p>"But wasn't there enough man beside your jacket to say
no?"</p>

<p>He did not answer. Down at the bottom he hated her. But he
was, to use his own words, all messed up with having lost his
strike-pay and with knowing the man was dead. So he was more
helpless before his mother-in-law, whom he feared. His wife
neither looked at him nor spoke, but kept her head bowed. He knew
she was with her mother.</p>

<p>"Our Maud's been waitin' for some money, to get a few things,"
said the mother-in-law.</p>

<p>In silence, he put five-and-sixpence on the table.</p>

<p>"Take that up, Maud," said the mother.</p>

<p>Maud did so.</p>

<p>"You'll want it for us board, shan't you?" she asked,
furtively, of her mother.</p>

<p>"Might I ask if there's nothing you want to buy yourself,
first?"</p>

<p>"No, there's nothink I want," answered the daughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marriott took the silver and counted it.</p>

<p>"And do you," said the mother-in-law, towering upon the
shrinking son, but speaking slowly and statelily, "do you think
I'm going to keep you and your wife for five and sixpence a
week?"</p>

<p>"It's a' I've got," he answered sulkily.</p>

<p>"You've had a good jaunt, my sirs, if it's cost four and
sixpence. You've started your game early, haven't you?"</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"It's a nice thing! Here's our Maud an' me been sitting since
eleven o'clock this morning! Dinner waiting and cleared away, tea
waiting and washed up; then in he comes crawling with five and
sixpence. Five and sixpence for a man an' wife's board for a
week, if you please!"</p>

<p>Still he did not say anything.</p>

<p>"You must think something of yourself, Ephraim Wharmby!" said
his mother-in-law. "You must think something of yourself. You
suppose, do you, <i>I'm</i> going to keep you an' your wife,
while you make a holiday, off on the nines to Nottingham, drink
an' women."</p>

<p>"I've neither had drink nor women, as you know right well," he
said.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we know summat about you. For you're that close,
anybody'd think we was foreigners to you. You're a pretty little
jockey, aren't you? Oh, it's a gala time for you, the strike is.
That's all men strike for, indeed. They enjoy themselves, they do
that. Ripping and racing and drinking, from morn till night, my
sirs!"</p>

<p>"Is there on'y tea for me?" he asked, in a temper.</p>

<p>"Hark at him! Hark-ye! Should I ask you whose house you think
you're in? Kindly order me about, do. Oh, it makes him big, the
strike does. See him land home after being out on the spree for
hours, and give his orders, my sirs! Oh, strike sets the men up,
it does. Nothing have they to do but guzzle and gallivant to
Nottingham. Their wives'll keep them, oh yes. So long as they get
something to eat at home, what more do they want! What more
<i>should</i> they want, prithee? Nothing! Let the women and
children starve and scrape, but fill the man's belly, and let him
have his fling. My sirs, indeed, I think so! Let tradesmen
go--what do they matter! Let rent go. Let children get what they
can catch. Only the man will see <i>he's</i> all right. But not
here, though!"</p>

<p>"Are you goin' ter gi'e me ony bloody tea?"</p>

<p>His mother-in-law started up.</p>

<p>"If tha dares ter swear at me, I'll lay thee flat."</p>

<p>"Are yer--goin' ter--gi'e me--any blasted, rotten,
c&ograve;ssed, bl&ograve;ody t&egrave;a?" he bawled, in a fury,
accenting every other word deliberately.</p>

<p>"Maud!" said the mother-in-law, cold and stately, "If you gi'e
him any tea after that, you're a trollops." Whereupon she sailed
out to her other daughters.</p>

<p>Maud quietly got the tea ready.</p>

<p>"Shall y'ave your dinner warmed up?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>She attended to him. Not that she was really meek. But--he was
<i>her</i> man, not her mother's.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s08">THE BLUE MOCCASINS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The fashion in women changes nowadays even faster than women's
fashions. At twenty, Lina M'Leod was almost painfully modern. At
sixty almost obsolete!</p>

<p>She started off in life to be really independent. In that
remote day, forty years ago, when a woman said she was going to
be independent, it meant she was having no nonsense with men. She
was kicking over the masculine traces, and living her own life,
manless.</p>

<p>To-day, when a girl says she is going to be independent, it
means she is going to devote her attentions almost exclusively to
men; though not necessarily to "a man".</p>

<p>Miss M'Leod had an income from her mother. Therefore, at the
age of twenty, she turned her back on that image of tyranny, her
father, and went to Paris to study art. Art having been studied,
she turned her attention to the globe of earth. Being terribly
independent, she soon made Africa look small; she dallied
energetically with vast hinterlands of China; and she knew the
Rocky Mountains and the deserts of Arizona as if she had been
married to them. All this, to escape mere man.</p>

<p>It was in New Mexico she purchased the blue moccasins, blue
bead moccasins, from an Indian who was her guide and her
subordinate. In her independence she made use of men, of course,
but merely as servants, subordinates.</p>

<p>When the war broke out she came home. She was then forty-five,
and already going grey. Her brother, two years older than
herself, but a bachelor, went off to the war; she stayed at home
in the small family mansion in the country, and did what she
could. She was small and erect and brief in her speech, her face
was like pale ivory, her skin like a very delicate parchment, and
her eyes were very blue. There was no nonsense about her, though
she did paint pictures. She never even touched her delicately
parchment face with pigment. She was good enough as she was,
honest-to-God, and the country town had a tremendous respect for
her.</p>

<p>In her various activities she came pretty often into contact
with Percy Barlow, the clerk at the bank, He was only twenty-two
when she first set eyes on him in 1914, and she immediately liked
him. He was a stranger in the town, his father being a poor
country vicar in Yorkshire. But he was of the confiding sort. He
soon confided in Miss M'Leod, for whom he had a towering respect,
how he disliked his step-mother, how he feared his father, was
but as wax in the hands of that downright woman, and how, in
consequence, he was homeless. Wrath shone in his pleasant
features, but somehow it was an amusing wrath; at least to Miss
M'Leod.</p>

<p>He was distinctly a good-looking boy, with stiff dark hair and
odd, twinkling grey eyes under thick dark brows, and a rather
full mouth and a queer, deep voice that had a caressing touch of
hoarseness. It was his voice that somehow got behind Miss
M'Leod's reserve. Not that he had the faintest intention of so
doing. He looked up to her immensely: "She's miles above me."</p>

<p>When she watched him playing tennis, letting himself go a bit
too much, hitting too hard, running too fast, being too nice to
his partner, her heart yearned over him. The orphan in him! Why
should he go and be shot? She kept him at home as long as
possible, working with her at all kinds of war-work. He was so
absolutely willing to do everything she wanted: devoted to
her.</p>

<p>But at last the time came when he must go. He was now
twenty-four and she was forty-seven. He came to say good-bye, in
his awkward fashion. She suddenly turned away, leaned her
forehead against the wall, and burst into bitter tears. He was
frightened out of his wits. Before he knew what was happening he
had his arm in front of his face and was sobbing too.</p>

<p>She came to comfort him. "Don't cry, dear, don't! It will all
be all right,"</p>

<p>At last he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked at her
sheepishly. "It was you crying as did me in," he said. Her blue
eyes were brilliant with tears. She suddenly kissed him.</p>

<p>"You are such a dear!" she said wistfully. Then she added,
flushing suddenly vivid pink under her transparent parchment
skin: "It wouldn't be right for you to marry an old thing like
me, would it?"</p>

<p>He looked at her dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"No, I'm too old," she added hastily.</p>

<p>"Don't talk about old! You're not old!" he said hotly.</p>

<p>"At least I'm too old for <i>that</i>," she said sadly.</p>

<p>"Not as far as I'm concerned," he said. "You're younger than
me, in most ways, I'm hanged if you're not!"</p>

<p>"Are you hanged if I'm not?" she teased wistfully.</p>

<p>"I am," he said. "And if I thought you wanted me, I'd be jolly
proud if you married me. I would, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Would you?" she said, still teasing him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the next time he was home on leave she married
him, very quietly, but very definitely. He was a young
lieutenant. They stayed in her family home, Twybit Hall, for the
honeymoon. It was her house now, her brother being dead. And they
had a strangely happy month. She had made a strange discovery: a
man.</p>

<p>He went off to Gallipoli, and became a captain. He came home
in 1919, still green with malaria, but otherwise sound. She was
in her fiftieth year. And she was almost white-haired; long,
thick, white hair, done perfectly, and perfectly creamy,
colourless face, with very blue eyes.</p>

<p>He had been true to her, not being very forward with women.
But he was a bit startled by her white hair. However, he shut his
eyes to it, and loved her. And she, though frightened and
somewhat bewildered, was happy. But she was bewildered. It always
seemed awkward to her, that he should come wandering into her
room in his pyjamas when she was half dressed, and brushing her
hair. And he would sit there silent, watching her brush the long
swinging river of silver, of her white hair, the bare,
ivory-white, slender arm working with a strange mechanical
motion, sharp and forcible, brushing down the long silvery stream
of hair. He would sit as if mesmerised, just gazing. And she
would at last glance round sharply, and he would rise, saying
some little casual thing to her and smiling to her oddly with his
eyes. Then he would go out, his thin cotton pyjamas hitching up
over his hips, for he was a rather big-built fellow. And she
would feel dazed, as if she did not quite know her own self any
more. And the queer, ducking motion of his silently going out of
her door impressed her ominously, his curious cat head, his big
hips and limbs.</p>

<p>They were alone in the house, save for the servants. He had no
work. They lived modestly, for a good deal of her money had been
lost during the war. But she still painted pictures. Marriage had
only stimulated her to this. She painted canvases of flowers,
beautiful flowers that thrilled her soul. And he would sit, pipe
in fist, silent, and watch her. He had nothing to do. He just sat
and watched her small, neat figure and her concentrated movements
as she painted. Then he knocked out his pipe and filled it
again.</p>

<p>She said that at last she was perfectly happy. And he said
that he was perfectly happy. They were always together. He hardly
went out, save riding in the lanes. And practically nobody came
to the house.</p>

<p>But still, they were very silent with one another. The old
chatter had died out. And he did not read much. He just sat
still, and smoked, and was silent. It got on her nerves
sometimes, and she would think as she had thought in the past,
that the highest bliss a human being can experience is perhaps
the bliss of being quite alone, quite, quite alone.</p>

<p>His bank firm offered to make him manager of the local branch,
and, at her advice, he accepted. Now he went out of the house
every morning and came home every evening, which was much more
agreeable. The rector begged him to sing again in the church
choir: and again she advised him to accept. These were the old
grooves in which his bachelor life had run. He felt more like
himself.</p>

<p>He was popular: a nice, harmless fellow, everyone said of him.
Some of the men secretly pitied him. They made rather much of
him, took him home to luncheon, and let him loose with their
daughters. He was popular among the daughters too: naturally, for
if a girl expressed a wish, he would instinctively say: "What!
Would you like it? I'll get it for you." And if he were not in a
position to satisfy the desire, he would say: "I only wish I
could do it for you. I'd do it like a shot." All of which he
meant.</p>

<p>At the same time, though he got on so well with the maidens of
the town, there was no coming forward about him. He was, in some
way, not wakened up. Good-looking, and big, and serviceable, he
was inwardly remote, without self-confidence, almost without a
self at all.</p>

<p>The rector's daughter took upon herself to wake him up. She
was exactly as old as he was, a smallish, rather sharp-faced
young woman who had lost her husband in the war, and it had been
a grief to her. But she took the stoic attitude of the young:
You've got to live, so you may as well do it! She was a kindly
soul, in spite of her sharpness. And she had a very perky little
red-brown Pomeranian dog that she had bought in Florence in the
street, but which had turned out a handsome little fellow. Miss
M'Leod looked down a bit on Alice Howells and her pom, so Mrs.
Howells felt no special love for Miss M'Leod--"Mrs. Barlow, that
is!" she would add sharply. "For it's quite impossible to think
of her as anything but Miss M'Leod!"</p>

<p>Percy was really more at ease at the rectory, where the pom
yapped and Mrs. Howells changed her dress three or four times a
day, and looked it, than in the semi-cloisteral atmosphere of
Twybit Hall, where Miss M'Leod wore tweeds and a natural knitted
jumper, her skirts rather long, her hair done up pure silver, and
painted her wonderful flower pictures in the deepening silence of
the daytime. At evening she would go up to change, after he came
home. And though it thrilled her to have a man coming into her
room as he dressed, snapping his collar-stud, to tell her
something trivial as she stood bare-armed in her silk slip,
rapidly coiling up the rope of silver hair behind her head,
still, it worried her. When he was there, he couldn't keep away
from her. And he would watch her, watch her, watch her as if she
was the ultimate revelation. Sometimes it made her irritable. She
was so absolutely used to her own privacy. What was he looking
at? She never watched <i>him.</i> Rather she looked the other
way. His watching tried her nerves. She was turned fifty. And his
great silent body loomed almost dreadful.</p>

<p>He was quite happy playing tennis or croquet with Alice
Howells and the rest. Alice was choir-mistress, a bossy little
person outwardly, inwardly rather forlorn and affectionate, and
not very sure that life hadn't let her down for good. She was now
over thirty--and had no one but the pom and her father and the
parish--nothing in her really intimate life. But she was very
cheerful, busy, even gay, with her choir and school work, her
dancing, and flirting, and dressmaking.</p>

<p>She was intrigued by Percy Barlow. "How <i>can</i> a man be so
nice to <i>everybody</i>?" she asked him, a little exasperated.
"Well, why not?" he replied, with the odd smile of his eyes.
"It's not why he shouldn't, but how he manages to do it! How can
you have so much good-nature? I <i>have</i> to be catty to some
people, but you're nice to <i>everybody</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, am I!" he said ominously.</p>

<p>He was like a man in a dream, or in a cloud. He was quite a
good bank-manager, in fact very intelligent. Even in appearance,
his great charm was his beautifully-shaped head. He had plenty of
brains, really. But in his will, in his body, he was asleep. And
sometimes this lethargy, or coma, made him look haggard. And
sometimes it made his body seem inert and despicable,
meaningless.</p>

<p>Alice Howells longed to ask him about his wife. "<i>Do</i> you
love her? <i>Can</i> you really care for her?" But she daren't.
She daren't ask him one word about his wife. Another thing she
couldn't do, she couldn't persuade him to dance. Never, not once.
But in everything else he was pliable as wax.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barlow--Miss M'Leod--stayed out at Twybit all the time.
She did not even come in to church on Sunday. She had shaken off
church, among other things. And she watched Percy depart, and
felt just a little humiliated. He was going to sing in the choir!
Yes, marriage was also a humiliation to her. She had distinctly
married beneath her.</p>

<p>The years had gone by: she was now fifty-seven, Percy was
thirty-four. He was still, in many ways, a boy. But in his
curious silence, he was ageless. She managed him with perfect
ease. If she expressed a wish, he acquiesced at once. So now it
was agreed he should not come to her room any more. And he never
did. But sometimes she went to him in his room, and was winsome
in a pathetic, heart-breaking way.</p>

<p>She twisted him round her little finger, as the saying goes.
And yet secretly she was afraid of him. In the early years he had
displayed a clumsy but violent sort of passion, from which she
had shrunk away. She felt it had nothing to do with her. It was
just his indiscriminating desire for Woman, and for his own
satisfaction. Whereas she was not just unidentified Woman, to
give him his general satisfaction. So she had recoiled, and
withdrawn herself. She had put him off. She had regained the
absolute privacy of her room.</p>

<p>He was perfectly sweet about it. Yet she was uneasy with him
now. She was afraid of him; or rather, not of him, but of a
mysterious something in him. She was not a bit afraid of
<i>him</i>, oh no! And when she went to him now, to be nice to
him, in her pathetic winsomeness of an unused woman of
fifty-seven, she found him sweet-natured as ever, but really
indifferent. He saw her pathos and her winsomeness. In some way,
the mystery of her, her thick white hair, her vivid blue eyes,
her ladylike refinement still fascinated him. But his bodily
desire for her had gone, utterly gone. And secretly, she was
rather glad. But as he looked at her, looked at her, as he lay
there so silent, she was afraid, as if some finger were pointed
at her. Yet she knew, the moment she spoke to him, he would twist
his eyes to that good-natured and "kindly" smile of his.</p>

<p>It was in the late, dark months of this year that she missed
the blue moccasins. She had hung them on a nail in his room. Not
that he ever wore them: they were too small. Nor did she: they
were too big. Moccasins are male footwear, among the Indians, not
female. But they were of a lovely turquoise-blue colour, made all
of little turquoise beads, with little forked flames of
dead-white and dark-green. When, at the beginning of their
marriage, he had exclaimed over them, she had said: "Yes! Aren't
they a lovely colour! So blue!" And he had replied: "Not as blue
as your eyes, even then."</p>

<p>So, naturally, she had hung them up on the wall in his room,
and there they had stayed. Till, one November day, when there
were no flowers, and she was pining to paint a still-life with
something blue in it--oh, so blue, like delphiniums!--she had
gone to his room for the moccasins. And they were not there. And
though she hunted, she could not find them. Nor did the maids
know anything of them.</p>

<p>So she asked him: "Percy, do you know where those blue
moccasins are, which hung in your room?" There was a moment's
dead silence. Then he looked at her with his good-naturedly
twinkling eyes, and said: "No, <i>I</i> know nothing of them."
There was another dead pause. She did not believe him. But being
a perfect lady, she only said, as she turned away: "Well then,
how curious it is!" And there was another dead pause. Out of
which he asked her what she wanted them for, and she told him.
Whereon the matter lapsed.</p>

<p>It was November, and Percy was out in the evening fairly often
now. He was rehearsing for a "play" which was to be given in the
church schoolroom at Christmas. He had asked her about it. "Do
you think it's a bit <i>infra dig.,</i> if I play one of the
characters?" She had looked at him mildly, disguising her real
feeling. "If you don't feel <i>personally</i> humiliated," she
said, "then there's nothing else to consider." And he had
answered: "Oh, it doesn't upset <i>me</i> at all." So she mildly
said: "Then do it, by all means." Adding at the back of her mind:
If it amuses you, child!--but she thought, a change had indeed
come over the world, when the master of Twybit Hall, or even, for
that matter, the manager of the dignified Stubb's Bank, should
perform in public on a schoolroom stage in amateur theatricals.
And she kept calmly aloof, preferring not to know any details.
She had a world of her own.</p>

<p>When he had said to Alice Howells: "You don't think other
folk'll mind--clients of the bank and so forth--think it beneath
my dignity?" she had cried, looking up into his twinkling eyes:
"Oh, you don't have to keep <i>your</i> dignity on ice,
Percy--any more than I do mine."</p>

<p>The play was to be performed for the first time on Christmas
Eve: and after the play, there was the midnight service in
church. Percy therefore told his wife not to expect him home till
the small hours, at least. So he drove himself off in the
car.</p>

<p>As night fell, and rain, Miss M'Leod felt a little forlorn.
She was left out of everything. Life was slipping past her. It
was Christmas Eve, and she was more alone than she had ever been.
Percy only seemed to intensify her aloneness, leaving her in this
fashion.</p>

<p>She decided not to be left out. She would go to the play too.
It was past six o'clock, and she had worked herself into a highly
nervous state. Outside was darkness and rain: inside was silence,
forlornness. She went to the telephone and rang up the garage in
Shrewbury. It was with great difficulty she got them to promise
to send a car for her: Mr. Slater would have to fetch her himself
in the two-seater runabout: everything else was out.</p>

<p>She dressed nervously, in a dark-green dress with a few modest
jewels. Looking at herself in the mirror, she still thought
herself slim, young-looking and distinguished. She did not see
how old-fashioned she was, with her uncompromising erectness, her
glistening knob of silver hair sticking out behind, and her long
dress.</p>

<p>It was a three-mile drive in the rain, to the small country
town. She sat next to old Slater, who was used to driving horses
and was nervous and clumsy with a car, without saying a word. He
thankfully deposited her at the gate of St. Barnabas' School.</p>

<p>It was almost half-past-seven. The schoolroom was packed and
buzzing with excitement. "I'm afraid we haven't a seat left, Mrs.
Barlow!" said Jackson, one of the church sidesmen, who was
standing guard in the school porch, where people were still
fighting to get in. He faced her in consternation. She faced him
in consternation. "Well, I shall have to stay somewhere, till Mr.
Barlow can drive me home," she said. "Couldn't you put me a chair
somewhere?"</p>

<p>Worried and flustered, he went worrying and flustering the
other people in charge. The schoolroom was simply packed solid.
But Mr. Simmons, the leading grocer, gave up his chair in the
front row to Mrs. Barlow, whilst he sat in a chair right under
the stage, where he couldn't see a thing. But he could see Mrs.
Barlow seated between his wife and daughter, speaking a word or
two to them occasionally, and that was enough.</p>

<p>The lights went down: <i>The Shoes of Shagput</i> was about to
begin. The amateur curtains were drawn back, disclosing the
little amateur stage with a white amateur back-cloth daubed to
represent a Moorish courtyard. In stalked Percy, dressed as a
Moor, his face darkened. He looked quite handsome, his pale grey
eyes queer and startling in his dark face. But he was afraid of
the audience--he spoke away from them, stalking around clumsily.
After a certain amount of would-be funny dialogue, in tripped the
heroine, Alice Howells, of course. She was an Eastern houri, in
white gauze Turkish trousers, silver veil, and--the blue
moccasins. The whole stage was white, save for her blue
moccasins, Percy's dark-green sash, and a negro boy's red
fez.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Barlow saw the blue moccasins, a little bomb of rage
exploded in her. This, of all places! The blue moccasins that she
had bought in the western deserts! The blue moccasins that were
not so blue as her own eyes! <i>Her</i> blue moccasins! On the
feet of that creature, Mrs. Howells.</p>

<p>Alice Howells was not afraid of the audience. She looked full
at them, lifting her silver veil. And of course she saw Mrs.
Barlow, sitting there like the Ancient of Days in judgment, in
the front row. And a bomb of rage exploded in <i>her</i> breast
too.</p>

<p>In the play, Alice was the wife of the grey-bearded old
Caliph, but she captured the love of the young Ali, otherwise
Percy, and the whole business was the attempt of these two to
evade Caliph and negro-eunuchs and ancient crones, and get into
each other's arms. The blue shoes were very important: for while
the sweet Lelia wore them, the gallant Ali was to know there was
danger. But when she took them off, he might approach her.</p>

<p>It was all quite childish, and everybody loved it, and Miss
M'Leod might have been quite complacent about it all, had not
Alice Howells got her monkey up, so to speak. Alice with a lot of
make-up, looked boldly handsome. And suddenly bold she was, bold
as the devil. All these years the poor young widow had been
"good", slaving in the parish, and only even flirting just to
cheer things up, never going very far and knowing she could never
get anything out of it, but determined never to mope.</p>

<p>Now the sight of Miss M'Leod sitting there so erect, so coolly
"higher plane", and calmly superior, suddenly let loose a devil
in Alice Howells. All her limbs went suave and molten, as her
young sex, long pent up, flooded even to her finger-tips. Her
voice was strange, even to herself, with its long, plaintive
notes. She felt all her movements soft and fluid, she felt
herself like living liquid. And it was lovely. Underneath it all
was the sting of malice against Miss M'Leod, sitting there so
erect, with her great knob of white hair.</p>

<p>Alice's business, as the lovely Leila, was to be seductive to
the rather heavy Percy. And seductive she was. In two minutes,
she had him spellbound. He saw nothing of the audience. A faint,
fascinated grin came on to his face, as he acted up to the young
woman in the Turkish trousers. His rather full, hoarse voice
changed and became clear, with a new, naked clang in it. When the
two sang together, in the simple banal duets of the play, it was
with a most fascinating intimacy. And when, at the end of Act
One, the lovely Leila kicked off the blue moccasins, saying:
"Away, shoes of bondage, shoes of sorrow!" and danced a little
dance all alone, barefoot, in her Turkish trousers, in front of
her fascinated hero, his smile was so spellbound that everybody
else was spellbound too.</p>

<p>Miss M'Leod's indignation knew no bounds. When the blue
moccasins were kicked across the stage by the brazen Alice, with
the words: "Away, shoes of bondage, shoes of sorrow!" the elder
woman grew pink with fury, and it was all she could do not to
rise and snatch the moccasins from the stage, and bear them away.
She sat in speechless indignation during the brief curtain
between Act One and Act Two. Her moccasins! Her blue moccasins!
Of the sacred blue colour, the turquoise of heaven.</p>

<p>But there they were, in Act Two, on the feet of the bold
Alice. It was becoming too much. And the love-scenes between
Percy and the young woman were becoming nakedly shameful. Alice
grew worse and worse. She was worked up now, caught in her own
spell, and unconscious of everything save of him, and the sting
of that other woman, who presumed to own him. Own him? Ha-ha! For
he was fascinated. The queer smile on his face, the concentrated
gleam of his eyes, the queer way he leaned forward from his loins
towards her, the new, reckless, throaty twang in his voice--the
audience had before their eyes a man spellbound and lost in
passion.</p>

<p>Miss M'Leod sat in shame and torment, as if her chair was
red-hot. She too was fast losing her normal consciousness, in the
spell of rage. She was outraged. The second Act was working up to
its climax. The climax came. The lovely Leila kicked off the blue
shoes: "Away, shoes of bondage, away!" and flew barefoot to the
enraptured Ali, flinging herself into his arms. And if ever a man
was gone in sheer desire, it was Percy, as he pressed the woman's
lithe form against his body, and seemed unconsciously to envelop
her, unaware of everything else. While she, blissful in his
spell, but still aware of the audience and of the superior Miss
M'Leod, let herself be wrapped closer and closer.</p>

<p>Miss M'Leod rose to her feet and looked towards the door. But
the way out was packed, with people standing holding their breath
as the two on the stage remained wrapped in each other's arms,
and the three fiddles and the flute softly woke up. Miss M'Leod
could not bear it. She was on her feet, and beside herself. She
could not get out. She could not sit down again.</p>

<p>"Percy!" she said, in a low clear voice. "Will you hand me my
moccasins?"</p>

<p>He lifted his face like a man startled in a dream, lifted his
face from the shoulder of his Leila. His gold-grey eyes were like
softly-startled flames. He looked in sheer horrified wonder at
the little white-haired woman standing below.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he said, purely dazed</p>

<p>"Will you please hand me my moccasins!"--and she pointed to
where they lay on the stage.</p>

<p>Alice had stepped away from him, and was gazing at the risen
viper of the little elderly woman on the tip of the audience.
Then she watched him move across the stage, bending forward from
the loins in his queer mesmerised way, pick up the blue
moccasins, and stoop down to hand them over the edge of the stage
to his wife, who reached up for them.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Miss M'Leod, seating herself, with the blue
moccasins in her lap.</p>

<p>Alice recovered her composure, gave a sign to the little
orchestra, and began to sing at once, strong and assured, to sing
her part in the duet that closed the Act. She knew she could
command public opinion in her favour.</p>

<p>He too recovered at once, the little smile came back on his
face, he calmly forgot his wife again as he sang his share in the
duet. It was finished. The curtains were pulled to. There was
immense cheering. The curtains opened, and Alice and Percy bowed
to the audience, smiling both of them their peculiar secret
smile, while Miss M'Leod sat with the blue moccasins in her
lap.</p>

<p>The curtains were closed, it was the long interval. After a
few moments of hesitation, Mrs. Barlow rose with dignity,
gathered her wrap over her arm, and with the blue moccasins in
her hand, moved towards the door. Way was respectfully made for
her.</p>

<p>"I should like to speak to Mr. Barlow," she said to Jackson,
who had anxiously ushered her in, and now would anxiously usher
her out.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Barlow."</p>

<p>He led her round to the smaller class-room at the back, that
acted as dressing-room. The amateur actors were drinking
lemonade, and chattering freely. Mrs. Howells came forward, and
Jackson whispered the news to her. She turned to Percy.</p>

<p>"Percy, Mrs. Barlow wants to speak to you. Shall I come with
you?"</p>

<p>"Speak to me? Aye, come on with me."</p>

<p>The two followed the anxious Jackson into the other
half-lighted class-room, where Mrs. Barlow stood in her wrap,
holding the moccasins. She was very pale, and she watched the two
butter-muslin Turkish figures enter, as if they could not
possibly be real. She ignored Mrs. Howells entirely.</p>

<p>"Percy," she said, "I want you to drive me home."</p>

<p>"Drive you home!" he echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes, please!"</p>

<p>"Why--when?" he said, with vague bluntness.</p>

<p>"Now--if you don't mind--"</p>

<p>"What--in this get-up?" He looked at himself.</p>

<p>"I could wait while you changed."</p>

<p>There was a pause. He turned and looked at Alice Howells, and
Alice Howells looked at him. The two women saw each other out of
the corners of their eyes: but it was beneath notice. He turned
to his wife, his black face ludicrously blank, his eyebrows
cocked.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," he said, "it's rather awkward. I can hardly
hold up the third Act while I've taken you home and got back here
again, can I?"</p>

<p>"So you intend to play in the third Act?" she asked with cold
ferocity.</p>

<p>"Why, I must, mustn't I?" he said blankly.</p>

<p>"Do you <i>wish</i> to?" she said, in all her intensity.</p>

<p>"I do, naturally. I want to finish the thing up properly," he
replied, in the utter innocence of his head; about his heart he
knew nothing.</p>

<p>She turned sharply away.</p>

<p>"Very well!" she said. And she called to Jackson, who was
standing dejectedly near the door: "Mr Jackson, will you please
find some car or conveyance to take me home?"</p>

<p>"Aye! I say, Mr. Jackson," called Percy in his strong,
democratic voice, going forward to the man. "Ask Tom Lomas if
he'll do me a good turn and get my car out of the rectory garage,
to drive Mrs. Barlow home. Aye, ask Tom Lomas! And if not him,
ask Mr. Pilkington--Leonard. The key's there. You don't mind, do
you? I'm ever so much obliged--"</p>

<p>The three were left awkwardly alone again.</p>

<p>"I expect you've had enough with two acts," said Percy
soothingly to his wife. "These things aren't up to your mark. I
know it. They're only child's play. But, you see, they please the
people. We've got a packed house, haven't we?"</p>

<p>His wife had nothing to answer. He looked so ludicrous, with
his dark-brown face and butter-muslin bloomers. And his mind was
so ludicrously innocent. His body, however, was not so
ridiculously innocent as his mind, as she knew when he turned to
the other woman.</p>

<p>"You and I, we're more on the nonsense level, aren't we?" he
said, with the new, throaty clang of naked intimacy in his voice.
His wife shivered.</p>

<p>"Absolutely on the nonsense level," said Alice, with easy
assurance.</p>

<p>She looked into his eyes, then she looked at the blue
moccasins in the hand of the other woman. He gave a little start,
as if realising something for himself.</p>

<p>At that moment Tom Lomas looked in, saying heartily: "Right
you are, Percy! I'll have my car here in half a tick. I'm more
handy with it than yours."</p>

<p>"Thanks, old man! You're a Christian."</p>

<p>"Try to be--especially when you turn Turk! Well--" He
disappeared.</p>

<p>"I say, Lina," said Percy in his most amiable democratic way,
"would you mind leaving the moccasins for the next act? We s'll
be in a bit of a hole without them."</p>

<p>Miss M'Leod faced him and stared at him with the full blast of
her forget-me-not blue eyes, from her white face.</p>

<p>"Will you pardon me if I don't?" she said.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed. "Why? Why not? It's nothing but play, to
amuse the people. I can't see how it can hurt the
<i>moccasins.</i> I understand you don't quite like seeing me
make a fool of myself. But, anyhow, I'm a bit of a born fool.
What?"--and his blackened face laughed with a Turkish laugh. "Oh,
yes, you have to realise I rather enjoy playing the fool," he
resumed. "And, after all, it doesn't really hurt <i>you</i>, now
does it? Shan't you leave us those moccasins for the last
act?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, then at the moccasins in her hand. No, it
was useless to yield to so ludicrous a person. The vulgarity of
his wheedling, the commonness of the whole performance! It was
useless to yield even the moccasins. It would be treachery to
herself.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said. "But I'd so much rather they weren't
used for this kind of thing. I never intended them to be." She
stood with her face averted from the ridiculous couple.</p>

<p>He changed as if she had slapped his face. He sat down on top
of the low pupils' desk and gazed with glazed interest round the
class-room. Alice sat beside him, in her white gauze and her
bedizened face. They were like two rebuked sparrows on one twig,
he with his great, easy, intimate limbs, she so light and alert.
And as he sat he sank into an unconscious physical sympathy with
her. Miss M'Leod walked towards the door.</p>

<p>"You'll have to think of something as'll do instead," he
muttered to Alice in a low voice, meaning the blue moccasins. And
leaning down, he drew off one of the grey shoes she had on,
caressing her foot with the slip of his hand over its slim, bare
shape. She hastily put the bare foot behind her other, shod
foot.</p>

<p>Tom Lomas poked in his head, his overcoat collar turned up to
his ears.</p>

<p>"Car's here," he said.</p>

<p>"Right-o! Tom! I'll chalk it up to thee, lad!" said Percy with
heavy breeziness. Then, making a great effort with himself, he
rose heavily and went across to the door, to his wife, saying to
her, in the same stiff voice of false heartiness:</p>

<p>"You'll be as right as rain with Tom. You won't mind if I
don't come out? No! I'd better not show myself to the audience.
Well--I'm glad you came, if only for a while. Good-bye then! I'll
be home after the service--but I shan't disturb you. Good-bye!
Don't get wet now--" And his voice, falsely cheerful, stiff with
anger, ended in a clang of indignation.</p>

<p>Alice Howells sat on the infants' bench in silence. She was
ignored. And she was unhappy, uneasy, because of the scene.</p>

<p>Percy closed the door after his wife. Then he turned with a
looming slowness to Alice, and said in a hoarse whisper: "Think
o' that, now!"</p>

<p>She looked up at him anxiously. His face, in its dark pigment,
was transfigured with indignant anger. His yellow-grey eyes
blazed, and a great rush of anger seemed to be surging up
volcanic in him. For a second his eyes rested on her upturned,
troubled, dark-blue eyes, then glanced away, as if he didn't want
to look at her in his anger. Even so, she felt a touch of
tenderness in his glance.</p>

<p>"And that's all she's ever cared about--her own things and her
own way," he said, in the same hoarse whisper, hoarse with
suddenly-released rage. Alice Howells hung her head in
silence.</p>

<p>"Not another damned thing, but what's her own, her own--and
her own holy way--damned holy-holy-holy, all to herself." His
voice shook with hoarse, whispering rage, burst out at last.</p>

<p>Alice Howells looked up at him in distress.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say it!" she said. "I'm sure she's fond of
you."</p>

<p>"<i>Fond</i> of me! Fond of <i>me</i>!" he blazed, with a grin
of transcendent irony. "It makes her sick to look at me. I am a
hairy brute, I own it. Why, she's never once touched me to be
fond of me--never once--though she pretends sometimes. But a man
knows--" and he made a grimace of contempt. "He knows when a
woman's just stroking him, good doggie!--and when she's really a
bit woman-fond of him. That woman's never been real fond of
anybody or anything, all her life--she couldn't, for all her show
of kindness. She's limited to herself, that woman is; and I've
looked up to her as if she was God. More fool me! If God's not
good-natured and good-hearted, then what is He--?"</p>

<p>Alice sat with her head dropped, realising once more that men
aren't really fooled. She was upset, shaken by his rage, and
frightened, as if she too were guilty. He had sat down blankly
beside her. She glanced up at him.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" she said soothingly. "You'll like her again
to-morrow."</p>

<p>He looked down at her with a grin, a grey sort of grin. "Are
you going to stroke me 'good doggie!' as well?" he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, blank.</p>

<p>But he did not answer. Then after a while he resumed:
"Wouldn't even leave the moccasins! And she's hung them up in my
room, left them there for years--any man'd consider they were
his. And I did want this show to-night to be a success! What are
you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I've sent over for a pair of pale-blue satin bed-slippers of
mine--they'll do just as well," she replied.</p>

<p>"Aye! For all that, it's done me in."</p>

<p>"You'll get over it."</p>

<p>"Happen so! She's curdled my inside, for all that. I don't
know how I'm going to be civil to her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better stay at the rectory to-night," she said
softly.</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes. And in that look, he transferred his
allegiance.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> don't want to be drawn in, do you?" he asked, with
troubled tenderness.</p>

<p>But she only gazed with wide, darkened eyes into his eyes, so
she was like an open, dark doorway to him. His heart beat thick,
and the faint, breathless smile of passion came into his eyes
again.</p>

<p>"You'll have to go on, Mrs. Howells. We can't keep them
waiting any longer."</p>

<p>It was Jim Stokes, who was directing the show. They heard the
clapping and stamping of the impatient audience.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" cried Alice Howells, darting to the door.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="s09">THE MORTAL COIL</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">I</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She stood motionless in the middle of the room, something
tense in her reckless bearing. Her gown of reddish stuff fell
silkily about her feet; she looked tall and splendid in the
candlelight. Her dark-blond hair was gathered loosely in a fold
on top of her head, her young, blossom-fresh face was lifted.
From her throat to her feet she was clothed in the elegantly-made
dress of silky red stuff, the colour of red earth. She looked
complete and lovely, only love could make her such a strange,
complete blossom. Her cloak and hat were thrown across a table
just in front of her.</p>

<p>Quite alone, abstracted, she stood there arrested in a
conflict of emotions. Her hand, down against her skirt, worked
irritably, the ball of the thumb rubbing, rubbing across the tips
of the fingers. There was a slight tension between her lifted
brows.</p>

<p>About her the room glowed softly, reflecting the candlelight
from its whitewashed walls, and from the great, bowed,
whitewashed ceiling. It was a large attic, with two windows, and
the ceiling curving down on either side, so that both the far
walls were low. Against one, on one side, was a single bed,
opened for the night, the white over-bolster piled back. Not far
from this was the iron stove. Near the window closest to the bed
was a table with writing materials, and a handsome cactus-plant
with clear scarlet blossoms threw its bizarre shadow on the wall.
There was another table near the second window, and opposite was
the door on which hung a military cloak. Along the far wall, were
guns and fishing-tackle, and some clothes too, hung on pegs--all
men's clothes, all military. It was evidently the room of a man,
probably a young lieutenant.</p>

<p>The girl, in her pure red dress that fell about her feet, so
that she looked a woman, not a girl, at last broke from her
abstraction and went aimlessly to the writing-table. Her mouth
was closed down stubbornly, perhaps in anger, perhaps in pain.
She picked up a large seal made of agate, looked at the ingraven
coat of arms, then stood rubbing her finger across the cut-out
stone, time after time. At last she put the seal down, and looked
at the other things--a beautiful old beer-mug used as a
tobacco-jar, a silver box like an urn, old and of exquisite
shape, a bowl of sealing wax. She fingered the pieces of wax.
This, the dark-green, had sealed her last letter. Ah, well! She
carelessly turned over the blotting book, which again had his
arms stamped on the cover. Then she went away to the window.
There, in the window-recess, she stood and looked out. She opened
the casement and took a deep breath of the cold night air. Ah, it
was good! Far below was the street, a vague golden milky way
beneath her, its tiny black figures moving and crossing and
re-crossing with marionette, insect-like intentness. A small
horse-car rumbled along the lines, so belittled, it was an
absurdity. So much for the world! . . . he did not come.</p>

<p>She looked overhead. The stars were white and flashing, they
looked nearer than the street, more kin to her, more real. She
stood pressing her breast on her arms, her face lifted to the
stars, in the long, anguished suspense of waiting. Noises came up
small from the street, as from some insect-world. But the great
stars overhead struck white and invincible, infallible. Her heart
felt cold like the stars.</p>

<p>At last she started. There was a noisy knocking at the door,
and a female voice calling:</p>

<p>"Anybody there?"</p>

<p>"Come in," replied the girl.</p>

<p>She turned round, shrinking from this intrusion, unable to
bear it, after the flashing stars.</p>

<p>There entered a thin, handsome dark girl dressed in an
extravagantly-made gown of dark purple silk and dark blue velvet.
She was followed by a small swarthy, inconspicuous lieutenant in
pale-blue uniform.</p>

<p>"Ah <i>you</i>! . . . alone?" cried Teresa, the newcomer,
advancing into the room. "Where's the Fritz, then?"</p>

<p>The girl in red raised her shoulders in a shrug, and turned
her face aside, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Not here! You don't know where he is? Ach, the dummy, the
lout!" Teresa swung round on her companion.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she demanded.</p>

<p>He also lifted his shoulders in a shrug.</p>

<p>"He said he was coming in half an hour," the young lieutenant
replied.</p>

<p>"Ha!--half an hour! Looks like it! How long is that ago--two
hours?"</p>

<p>Again the young man only shrugged. He had beautiful black
eye-lashes, and steady eyes. He stood rather deprecatingly,
whilst his girl, golden like a young panther, hung over him.</p>

<p>"One knows where he is," said Teresa, going and sitting on the
opened bed. A dangerous contraction came between the brows of
Marta, the girl in red, at this act.</p>

<p>"Wine, Women and Cards!" said Teresa, in her loud voice. "But
they prefer the women on the cards.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>'My love he has four Queenies,<br>
 Four Queenies has my lo-o-ove,'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>she sang. Then she broke off, and turned to Podewils. "Was he
winning when you left him, Karl?"</p>

<p>Again the young baron raised his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Tant pis que mal,' he replied, cryptically.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>you</i>!" cried Teresa, "with your <i>tant pis que
mal</i>! Are <i>you</i> tant pis que mal?" She laughed her deep,
strange laugh. "Well," she added, "he'll be coming in with a
fortune for you, Marta--"</p>

<p>There was a vague, unhappy silence.</p>

<p>"I know his fortunes," said Marta.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Teresa, in sudden sober irony, "he's a horse-shoe
round your neck, is that young jockey.--But what are you going to
do, Matzen dearest? You're not going to wait for him any
longer?--Don't dream of it! The idea, waiting for that young
gentleman as if you were married to him!--Put your hat on,
dearest, and come along with us . . . Where are we going, Karl,
you pillar of salt?--Eh?--Geier's?--To Geier's, Marta, my dear.
Come, quick, up--you've been martyred enough, Marta, my
martyr--haw!--haw!!--put your hat on. Up--away!"</p>

<p>Teresa sprang up like an explosion, anxious to be off.</p>

<p>"No, I'll wait for him," said Marta, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Don't be such a fool!" cried Teresa, in her deep voice. "Wait
for him! <i>I'd</i> give him wait for him. Catch this little bird
waiting." She lifted her hand and blew a little puff across the
fingers. "Choo-fly!" she sang, as if a bird had just flown.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant stood silent with smiling dark eyes.
Teresa was quick, and golden as a panther.</p>

<p>"No, but really, Marta, you're not going to wait any
more--really! It's stupid for you to play Gretchen--your eyes are
much too green. Put your hat on, there's a darling."</p>

<p>"No," said Marta, her flower-like face strangely stubborn.
"I'll wait for him. He'll have to come some time."</p>

<p>There was a moment's uneasy pause.</p>

<p>"Well," said Teresa, holding her long shoulders for her cloak,
"so long as you don't wait as long as
Lenora-fuhr-ums-Morgenrot--! Adieu, my dear, God be with
you."</p>

<p>The young lieutenant bowed a solicitous bow, and the two went
out, leaving the girl in red once more alone.</p>

<p>She went to the writing table, and on a sheet of paper began
writing her name in stiff Gothic characters, time after time:</p>

<p>Marta Hohenest</p>

<p>Marta Hohenest</p>

<p>Marta Hohenest.</p>

<p>The vague sounds from the street below continued. The wind was
cold. She rose and shut the window. Then she sat down again.</p>

<p>At last the door opened, and a young officer entered. He was
buttoned up in a dark-blue great-coat, with large silver buttons
going down on either side of the breast. He entered quickly,
glancing over the room, at Marta, as she sat with her back to
him. She was marking with a pencil on paper. He closed the door.
Then with fine beautiful movements he divested himself of his
coat and went to hang it up. How well Marta knew the sound of his
movements, the quick light step! But she continued mechanically
making crosses on the paper, her head bent forward between the
candles, so that her hair made fine threads and mist of light,
very beautiful. He saw this, and it touched him. But he could not
afford to be touched any further.</p>

<p>"You have been waiting?" he said formally. The insulting
futile question! She made no sign, as if she had not heard. He
was absorbed in the tragedy of himself, and hardly heeded
her.</p>

<p>He was a slim, good-looking youth, clear-cut and delicate in
mould. His features now were pale, there was something evasive in
his dilated, vibrating eyes. He was barely conscious of the girl,
intoxicated with his own desperation, that held him mindless and
distant.</p>

<p>To her, the atmosphere of the room was almost unbreathable,
since he had come in. She felt terribly bound, walled up. She
rose with a sudden movement that tore his nerves. She looked to
him tall and bright and dangerous, as she faced round on him.</p>

<p>"Have you come back with a fortune?" she cried, in mockery,
her eyes full of dangerous light.</p>

<p>He was unfastening his belt, to change his tunic. She watched
him up and down, all the time. He could not answer, his lips
seemed dumb. Besides, silence was his strength.</p>

<p>"Have you come back with a fortune?" she repeated, in her
strong, clear voice of mockery.</p>

<p>"No," he said, suddenly turning. "Let it please you that--that
I've come back at all."</p>

<p>He spoke desperately, and tailed off into silence. He was a
man doomed. She looked at him: he was insignificant in his doom.
She turned in ridicule. And yet she was afraid; she loved
him.</p>

<p>He had stood long enough exposed, in his helplessness. With
difficulty he took a few steps, went and sat down at the
writing-table. He looked to her like a dog with its tail between
its legs.</p>

<p>He saw the paper, where her name was repeatedly written. She
must find great satisfaction in her own name, he thought vaguely.
Then he picked up the seal and kept twisting it round in his
fingers, doing some little trick. And continually the seal fell
on to the table with a sudden rattle that made Marta stiffen
cruelly. He was quite oblivious of her.</p>

<p>She stood watching as he sat bent forward in his stupefaction.
The fine cloth of his uniform showed the moulding of his back.
And something tortured her as she saw him, till she could hardly
bear it: the desire of his finely-shaped body, the stupefaction
and the abjectness of him now, his immersion in the tragedy of
himself, his being unaware of her. All her will seemed to grip
him, to bruise some manly nonchalance and attention out of
him.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're in a fury with me, for being late?" he said,
with impotent irony in his voice. Her fury over trifles, when he
was lost in calamity! How great was his real misery, how trivial
her small offendedness!</p>

<p>Something in his tone burned her, and made her soul go
cold.</p>

<p>"I'm not exactly pleased," she said coldly, turning away to a
window.</p>

<p>Still he sat bent over the table, twisting something with his
fingers. She glanced round on him. How nervy he was! He had
beautiful hands, and the big topaz signet-ring on his finger made
yellow lights. Ah, if only his hands were really dare-devil and
reckless! They always seemed so guilty, so cowardly.</p>

<p>"I'm done for now," he said suddenly, as if to himself,
tilting back his chair a little. In all his physical movement he
was so fine and poised, so sensitive! Oh, and it attracted her so
much!</p>

<p>"Why?" she said, carelessly.</p>

<p>An anger burned in him. She was so flippant. If he were going
to be shot, she would not be moved more than about half a pound
of sweets.</p>

<p>"Why!" he repeated laconically. "The same unimportant reason
as ever."</p>

<p>"Debts?" she cried, in contempt.</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>Her soul burned in anger.</p>

<p>"What have you done now?--lost more money?"</p>

<p>"Three thousand marks."</p>

<p>She was silent in deep wrath.</p>

<p>"More fool you!" she said. Then, in her anger, she was silent
for some minutes. "And so you're done for, for three thousand
marks?" she exclaimed, jeering at him. "You go pretty cheap."</p>

<p>"Three thousand--and the rest," he said, keeping up a manly
<i>sang froid</i>."</p>

<p>"And the rest!" she repeated in contempt. "And for three
thousand--and the rest, your life is over!"</p>

<p>"My career," he corrected her.</p>

<p>"Oh," she mocked, "only your career! I thought it was a matter
of life and death. Only your career? Oh, only that!"</p>

<p>His eyes grew furious under her mockery.</p>

<p>"My career <i>is</i> my life," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it!--You're not a <i>man</i> then, you are only a
career?"</p>

<p>"I am a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you! How amusing! How very amusing, to be a
gentleman, and not a man!--I suppose that's what it means, to be
a gentleman, to have no guts outside your career?"</p>

<p>"Outside my honour--none."</p>

<p>"And might I ask what <i>is</i> your honour?" She spoke in
extreme irony.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may ask," he replied coolly. "But if you don't know
without being told, I'm afraid I could never explain it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you couldn't! No, I believe you--you are incapable of
explaining it, it wouldn't bear explaining." There was a long,
tense pause. "So you've made too many debts, and you're afraid
they'll kick you out of the army, therefore your honour is gone,
is it?--And what then--what after that?"</p>

<p>She spoke in extreme irony. He winced again at her phrase
"kick you out of the army". But he tilted his chair back with
assumed nonchalance.</p>

<p>"I've made too many debts, and I <i>know</i> they'll kick me
out of the army," he repeated, thrusting the thorn right home to
the quick. "After that--I can shoot myself. Or I might even be a
waiter in a restaurant--or possibly a clerk, with twenty-five
shillings a week."</p>

<p>"Really!--All those alternatives!--Well, why not, why not be a
waiter in the Germania? It might be awfully jolly."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he repeated ironically. "Because it wouldn't become
me."</p>

<p>She looked at him, at his aristocratic fineness of physique,
his extreme physical sensitiveness. And all her German worship
for his old, proud family rose up in her. No, he could not be a
waiter in the Germania: she could not bear it. He was too refined
and beautiful a thing.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she cried suddenly. "It wouldn't come to that, either.
If they kick you out of the army, you'll find somebody to get
round--you're like a cat, you'll land on your feet."</p>

<p>But this was just what he was not. He was not like a cat. His
self-mistrust was too deep. Ultimately he had no belief in
himself, as a separate isolated being. He knew he was
sufficiently clever, an aristocrat, good-looking, the sensitive
superior of most men. The trouble was, that apart from the social
fabric he belonged to, he felt himself nothing, a cipher. He
bitterly envied the common working-men for a certain manly
aplomb, a grounded, almost stupid self-confidence he saw in them.
Himself--he could lead such men through the gates of hell--for
what did he care about danger or hurt to himself, whilst he was
leading? But--cut him off from all this, and what was he? A
palpitating rag of meaningless human life.</p>

<p>But she, coming from the people, could not fully understand.
And it was best to leave her in the dark. The free indomitable
self-sufficient being which a man must be in his relation to a
woman who loves him--this he could pretend. But he knew he was
not it. He knew that the world of man from which he took his
value was his mistress beyond any woman. He wished, secretly,
cravingly, almost cravenly, in his heart, it was not so. But so
it was.</p>

<p>Therefore, he heard her phrase "you're like a cat," with some
bitter envy.</p>

<p>"Whom shall I get round?--some woman, who will marry me?" he
said.</p>

<p>This was a way out. And it was almost the inevitable thing,
for him. But he felt it the last ruin of his manhood, even
he.</p>

<p>The speech hurt her mortally, worse than death. She would
rather he died, because then her own love would not turn to
ash.</p>

<p>"Get married, then, if you want to," she said, in a small
broken voice.</p>

<p>"Naturally," he said.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, a foretaste of barren
hopelessness.</p>

<p>"Why is it so terrible to you," she asked at length, "to come
out of the army and trust to your own resources? Other men are
strong enough."</p>

<p>"Other men are not me," he said.</p>

<p>Why would she torture him? She seemed to enjoy torturing him.
The thought of his expulsion from the army was an agony to him,
really worse than death. He saw himself in the despicable
civilian clothes, engaged in some menial occupation. And he could
not bear it. It was too heavy a cross.</p>

<p>Who was she to talk? She was herself, an actress, daughter of
a tradesman. He was himself. How should one of them speak for the
other? It was impossible. He loved her. He loved her far better
than men usually loved their mistresses. He really cared.--And he
was strangely proud of his love for her, as if it were a
distinction to him . . . But there was a limit to her
understanding. There was a point beyond which she had nothing to
do with him, and she had better leave him alone. Here in this
crisis, which was <i>his</i> crisis, his downfall, she should not
presume to talk, because she did not understand.--But she loved
to torture him, that was the truth.</p>

<p>"Why should it hurt you to work?" she reiterated.</p>

<p>He lifted his face, white and tortured, his grey eyes flaring
with fear and hate.</p>

<p>"Work!" he cried. "What do you think I am worth?--Twenty-five
shillings a week, if I am lucky."</p>

<p>His evident anguish penetrated her. She sat dumbfounded,
looking at him with wide eyes. He was white with misery and fear;
his hand, that lay loose on the table, was abandoned in nervous
ignominy. Her mind filled with wonder, and with deep, cold dread.
Did he really care so much? But did it <i>really</i> matter so
much to him? When he said he was worth twenty-five shillings a
week, he was like a man whose soul is pierced. He sat there,
annihilated. She looked for him, and he was nothing then. She
looked for the man, the free being that loved her. And he was
not, he was gone, this blank figure remained. Something with a
blanched face sat there in the chair, staring at nothing.</p>

<p>His amazement deepened with intolerable dread. It was as if
the world had fallen away into chaos. Nothing remained. She
seemed to grasp the air for foothold.</p>

<p>He sat staring in front of him, a dull numbness settled on his
brain. He was watching the flame of the candle. And, in his
detachment, he realized the flame was a swiftly travelling flood,
flowing swiftly from the source of the wick through a white surge
and on into the darkness above. It was like a fountain suddenly
foaming out, then running on dark and smooth. Could one dam the
flood? He took a piece of paper, and cut off the flame for a
second.</p>

<p>The girl in red started at the pulse of the light. She seemed
to come to, from some trance. She saw his face, clear now,
attentive, abstract, absolved. He was quite absolved from his
temporal self.</p>

<p>"It isn't true," she said, "is it? It's not so tragic,
really?--It's only your pride is hurt, your silly little pride?"
She was rather pleading.</p>

<p>He looked at her with clear steady eyes.</p>

<p>"My pride!" he said. "And isn't my pride <i>me</i>? What am I
without my pride?"</p>

<p>"You are <i>yourself</i>," she said. "If they take your
uniform off you, and turn you naked into the street, you are
still <i>yourself</i>."</p>

<p>His eyes grew hot. Then he cried:</p>

<p>"What does it mean, <i>myself</i>! It means I put on
ready-made civilian clothes and do some dirty drudging elsewhere:
that is what <i>myself</i> amounts to."</p>

<p>She knitted her brows.</p>

<p>"But what you are <i>to me--</i>that naked self which you are
to me--that is something, isn't it?--everything," she said.</p>

<p>"What is it, if it means nothing?" he said: "What is it, more
than a pound of chocolate <i>drag&eacute;es</i>?--It stands for
nothing--unless as you say, a petty clerkship, at twenty-five
shillings a week."</p>

<p>These were all wounds to her, very deep. She looked in wonder
for a few moments.</p>

<p>"And what does it stand for now?" she said. "A magnificent
second-lieutenant!"</p>

<p>He made a gesture of dismissal with his hand.</p>

<p>She looked at him from under lowered brows.</p>

<p>"And our love!" she said. "It means nothing to you, nothing at
all?"</p>

<p>"To me as a menial clerk, what does it mean? What does love
mean! Does it mean that a man shall be no more than a dirty rag
in the world?--What worth do you think I have in love, if in life
I am a wretched inky subordinate clerk?"</p>

<p>"What does it matter?"</p>

<p>"It matters everything."</p>

<p>There was silence for a time, then the anger flashed up in
her.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter to you what <i>I</i> feel, whether <i>I</i>
care or not," she cried, her voice rising. "They'll take his
little uniform with buttons off him, and he'll have to be a
common little civilian, so all he can do is to shoot himself!--It
doesn't matter that I'm there--"</p>

<p>He sat stubborn and silent. He thought her vulgar. And her
raving did not alter the situation in the least.</p>

<p>"Don't you see what value you put on <i>me</i>, you clever
little man?" she cried in fury. "I've loved you, loved you with
all my soul, for two years--and you've lied, and said you loved
me. And now, what do I get? He'll shoot himself, because his
tuppenny vanity is wounded.--Ah, <i>fool</i>--!"</p>

<p>He lifted his head and looked at her. His face was fixed and
superior.</p>

<p>"All of which," he said, "leaves the facts of the case quite
untouched!"</p>

<p>She hated his cool little speeches.</p>

<p>"Then shoot yourself," she cried, "and you'll be worth
<i>less</i> than twenty-five shillings a week!"</p>

<p>There was a fatal silence.</p>

<p>"<i>Then</i> there'll be no question of worth," he said.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she ejaculated in scorn.</p>

<p>She had finished. She had no more to say. At length, after
they had both sat motionless and silent, separate, for some time,
she rose and went across to her hat and cloak. He shrank in
apprehension. Now, he could not bear her to go. He shrank as if
he were being whipped. She put her hat on, roughly, then swung
her warm plaid cloak over her shoulders. Her hat was of black
glossy silk, with a sheeny heap of cocks-feathers, her plaid
cloak was dark green and blue, it swung open above her clear
harsh-red dress. How beautiful she was, like a fiery Madonna!</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, in her voice of mockery. "I'm going
now."</p>

<p>He sat motionless, as if loaded with fetters. She hesitated,
then moved towards the door.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a spring like a cat, he was confronting her,
his back to the door. His eyes were full and dilated, like a
cat's, his face seemed to gleam at her. She quivered, as some
subtle fluid ran through her nerves.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she said dumbly. "I've had enough." His eyes,
with a wide, dark electric pupil, like a cat's, only watched her
objectively. And again a wave of female submissiveness went over
her.</p>

<p>"I want to go," she pleaded. "You know it's no good.--You know
this is no good."</p>

<p>She stood humbly before him. A flexible little grin quivered
round his mouth.</p>

<p>"You know you don't want me," she persisted. "You know you
don't really want me.--You only do this to show your power over
me--which is a mean trick."</p>

<p>But he did not answer, only his eyes narrowed in a sensual,
cruel smile. She shrank, afraid, and yet she was fascinated.</p>

<p>"You won't go yet," he said.</p>

<p>She tried in vain to rouse her real opposition.</p>

<p>"I shall call out," she threatened. "I shall shame you before
people."</p>

<p>His eyes narrowed again in the smile of vindictive, mocking
indifference.</p>

<p>"Call then," he said.</p>

<p>And at the sound of his still, cat-like voice, an intoxication
ran over her veins.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i>," she said, looking defiantly into his eyes.
But the smile in the dark, full, dilated pupils made her waver
into submission again.</p>

<p>"Won't you let me go?" she pleaded sullenly.</p>

<p>Now the smile went openly over his face.</p>

<p>"Take your hat off," he said.</p>

<p>And with quick, light fingers he reached up and drew out the
pins of her hat, unfastened the clasp of her cloak, and laid her
things aside.</p>

<p>She sat down in a chair. Then she rose again, and went to the
window. In the street below, the tiny figures were moving just
the same. She opened the window, and leaned out, and wept.</p>

<p>He looked round at her in irritation as she stood in her long,
clear-red dress in the window-recess, leaning out. She was
exasperating.</p>

<p>"You will be cold," he said.</p>

<p>She paid no heed. He guessed, by some tension in her attitude,
that she was crying. It irritated him exceedingly, like a
madness. After a few minutes of suspense, he went across to her,
and took her by the arm. His hand was subtle, soft in its touch,
and yet rather cruel than gentle.</p>

<p>"Come away," he said. "Don't stand there in the air--come
away."</p>

<p>He drew her slowly away to the bed, she sat down, and he
beside her.</p>

<p>"What are you crying for?" he said in his strange, penetrating
voice, that had a vibration of exultancy in it. But her tears
only ran faster.</p>

<p>He kissed her face, that was soft, and fresh, and yet warm,
wet with tears. He kissed her again, and again, in pleasure of
the soft, wet saltness of her. She turned aside and wiped her
face with her handkerchief, and blew her nose. He was
disappointed--yet the way she blew her nose pleased him.</p>

<p>Suddenly she slid away to the floor, and hid her face in the
side of the bed, weeping and crying loudly:</p>

<p>"You don't love me--Oh, you don't love me--I thought you did,
and you let me go on thinking it--but you don't, no, you don't,
and I can't bear it.--Oh, I can't bear it."</p>

<p>He sat and listened to the strange, animal sound of her
crying. His eyes flickered with exultancy, his body seemed full
and surcharged with power. But his brows were knitted in tension.
He laid his hand softly on her head, softly touched her face,
which was buried against the bed.</p>

<p>She suddenly rubbed her face against the sheets, and looked up
once more.</p>

<p>"You've deceived me," she said, as she sat beside him.</p>

<p>"Have I? Then I've deceived myself." His body felt so charged
with male vigour, he was almost laughing in his strength.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said enigmatically, fatally. She seemed absorbed in
her thoughts. Then her face quivered again.</p>

<p>"And I loved you so much," she faltered, the tears rising.
There was a clangour of delight in his heart.</p>

<p>"I love <i>you</i>," he said softly, softly touching her,
softly kissing her, in a sort of subtle, restrained ecstasy.</p>

<p>She shook her head stubbornly. She tried to draw away. Then
she did break away, and turned to look at him, in fear and doubt.
The little, fascinating, fiendish lights were hovering in his
eyes like laughter.</p>

<p>"Don't hurt me so much," she faltered, in a last protest.</p>

<p>A faint smile came on his face. He took her face between his
hands and covered it with soft, blinding kisses, like a soft,
narcotic rain. He felt himself such an unbreakable fountain-head
of powerful blood. He was trembling finely in all his limbs, with
mastery.</p>

<p>When she lifted her face and opened her eyes, her face was
wet, and her greenish-golden eyes were shining, it was like
sudden sunshine in wet foliage. She smiled at him like a child of
knowledge, through the tears, and softly, infinitely softly he
dried her tears with his mouth and his soft young moustache.</p>

<p>"You'd never shoot yourself, because you're mine, aren't you!"
she said, knowing the fine quivering of his body, in mastery.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"Quite mine?" she said, her voice rising in ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Nobody else but mine--nothing at all--?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," he re-echoed.</p>

<p>"But me?" came her last words of ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>And she seemed to be released free into the infinite of
ecstasy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">II</p>

<p> </p>

<p>They slept in fulfilment through the long night. But then
strange dreams began to fill them both, strange dreams that were
neither waking nor sleeping;--only, in curious weariness, through
her dreams, she heard at last a continual low rapping. She awoke
with difficulty. The rapping began again--she started violently.
It was at the door--it would be the orderly rapping for
Friedeburg. Everything seemed wild and unearthly. She put her
hand on the shoulder of the sleeping man, and pulled him roughly,
waited a moment, then pushed him, almost violently, to awake him.
He woke with a sense of resentment at her violent handling. Then
he heard the knocking of the orderly. He gathered his senses.</p>

<p>"Yes, Heinrich!" he said.</p>

<p>Strange, the sound of a voice! It seemed a far-off tearing
sound. Then came the muffled voice of the servant.</p>

<p>"Half past four, Sir."</p>

<p>"Right!" said Friedeburg, and automatically he got up and made
a light. She was suddenly as wide awake as if it were daylight.
But it was a strange, false day, like a delirium. She saw him put
down the match, she saw him moving about, rapidly dressing. And
the movement in the room was a trouble to her. He himself was
vague and unreal, a thing seen but not comprehended. She watched
all the acts of his toilet, saw all the motions, but never saw
him. There was only a disturbance about her, which fretted her,
she was not aware of any presence. Her mind, in its strange,
hectic clarity, wanted to consider things in absolute detachment.
For instance, she wanted to consider the cactus plant. It was a
curious object with pure scarlet blossoms. Now, how did these
scarlet blossoms come to pass, upon that earthly-looking unliving
creature? Scarlet blossoms! How wonderful they were! What were
they, then, how could one lay hold on their being? Her mind
turned to him. Him, too, how could one lay hold on him, to have
him? Where was he, what was he? She seemed to grasp at the
air.</p>

<p>He was dipping his face in the cold water--the slight shock
was good for him. He felt as if someone had stolen away his being
in the night, he was moving about a light, quick shell, with all
his meaning absent. His body was quick and active, but all his
deep understanding, his soul was gone. He tried to rub it back
into his face. He was quite dim, as if his spirit had left his
body.</p>

<p>"Come and kiss me," sounded the voice from the bed. He went
over to her automatically. She put her arms around him and looked
into his face with her clear brilliant, grey-green eyes, as if
she too were looking for his soul.</p>

<p>"How are you?" came her meaningless words.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Kiss me."</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her.</p>

<p>And still her clear, rather frightening eyes seemed to be
searching for him inside himself. He was like a bird transfixed
by her pellucid, grey-green, wonderful eyes. She put her hands
into his soft, thick, fine hair, and gripped her hands full of
his hair. He wondered with fear at her sudden painful
clutching.</p>

<p>"I shall be late," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. And she let him go.</p>

<p>As he fastened his tunic he glanced out of the window. It was
still night: a night that must have lasted since eternity. There
was a moon in the sky. In the streets below the yellow
street-lamps burned small at intervals. This was the night of
eternity.</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door, and the orderly's voice.</p>

<p>"Coffee, Sir."</p>

<p>"Leave it there."</p>

<p>They heard the faint jingle of the tray as it was set down
outside.</p>

<p>Friedeburg sat down to put on his boots. Then, with a man's
solid tread, he went and took in the tray. He felt properly heavy
and secure now in his accoutrement. But he was always aware of
her two wonderful, clear, unfolded eyes, looking on his heart,
out of her uncanny silence.</p>

<p>There was a strong smell of coffee in the room.</p>

<p>"Have some coffee?" His eyes could not meet hers.</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>"Just a drop?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>Her voice sounded quite gay. She watched him dipping his bread
in the coffee and eating quickly, absently. He did not know what
he was doing, and yet the dipped bread and hot coffee gave him
pleasure. He gulped down the remainder of his drink, and rose to
his feet.</p>

<p>"I must go," he said.</p>

<p>There was a curious, poignant smile in her eyes. Her eyes drew
him to her. How beautiful she was, and dazzling, and frightening,
with this look of brilliant tenderness seeming to glitter from
her face. She drew his head down to her bosom, and held it fast
prisoner there, murmuring with tender, triumphant delight: "Dear!
Dear!"</p>

<p>At last she let him lift his head, and he looked into her
eyes, that seemed to concentrate in a dancing, golden point of
vision in which he felt himself perish.</p>

<p>"Dear!" she murmured. "You love me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said mechanically.</p>

<p>The golden point of vision seemed to leap to him from her
eyes, demanding something. He sat slackly, as if spellbound. Her
hand pushed him a little.</p>

<p>"Mustn't you go?" she said.</p>

<p>He rose. She watched him fastening the belt round his body,
that seemed soft under the fine clothes. He pulled on his
great-coat, and put on his peaked cap. He was again a young
officer.</p>

<p>But he had forgotten his watch. It lay on the table near the
bed. She watched him slinging it on his chain. He looked down at
her. How beautiful she was, with her luminous face and her fine,
stray hair! But he felt far away.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do for you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, thank you--I'll sleep," she replied, smiling. And the
strange golden spark danced on her eyes again, again he felt as
if his heart were gone, destroyed out of him. There was a fine
pathos too in her vivid, dangerous face.</p>

<p>He kissed her for the last time, saying:</p>

<p>"I'll blow the candles out, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my love--and I'll sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes--sleep as long as you like."</p>

<p>The golden spark of her eyes seemed to dance on him like a
destruction, she was beautiful, and pathetic. He touched her
tenderly with his finger-tips, then suddenly blew out the
candles, and walked across in the faint moonlight to the
door.</p>

<p>He was gone. She heard his boots click on the stone
stairs--she heard the far below tread of his feet on the
pavement. Then he was gone. She lay quite still, in a swoon of
deathly peace. She never wanted to move any more. It was
finished. She lay quite still, utterly, utterly abandoned.</p>

<p>But again she was disturbed. There was a little tap at the
door, then Teresa's voice saying, with a shuddering sound because
of the cold:</p>

<p>"Ugh!--I'm coming to you, Marta my dear. I can't stand being
left alone."</p>

<p>"I'll make a light," said Marta, sitting up and reaching for
the candle. "Lock the door, will you, Resie, and then nobody can
bother us."</p>

<p>She saw Teresa, loosely wrapped in her cloak, two thick ropes
of hair hanging untidily. Teresa looked voluptuously sleepy and
easy, like a cat running home to the warmth.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" she said, "it's cold!"</p>

<p>And she ran to the stove. Marta heard the chink of the little
shovel, a stirring of coals, then a clink of the iron door. Then
Teresa came running to the bed, with a shuddering little run, she
puffed out the light and slid in beside her friend.</p>

<p>"So cold!" she said, with a delicious shudder at the warmth.
Marta made place for her, and they settled down.</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad you're not them?" said Resie, with a little
shudder at the thought. "Ugh!--poor devils!"</p>

<p>"I am," said Marta.</p>

<p>"Ah, sleep--sleep, how lovely!" said Teresa, with deep
content. "Ah, it's so good!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marta.</p>

<p>"Good morning, good night, my dear," said Teresa, already
sleepily.</p>

<p>"Good night," responded Marta.</p>

<p>Her mind flickered a little. Then she sank unconsciously to
sleep. The room was silent.</p>

<p>Outside, the setting moon made peaked shadows of the
high-roofed houses; from twin towers that stood like two dark,
companion giants in the sky, the hour trembled out over the
sleeping town. But the footsteps of hastening officers and
cowering soldiers rang on the frozen pavements. Then a lantern
appeared in the distance, accompanied by the rattle of a bullock
wagon. By the light of the lantern on the wagon-pole could be
seen the delicately moving feet and the pale, swinging dewlaps of
the oxen. They drew slowly on, with a rattle of heavy wheels, the
banded heads of the slow beasts swung rhythmically.</p>

<p>Ah, this was life! How sweet, sweet each tiny incident was!
How sweet to Friedeburg, to give his orders ringingly on the
frosty air, to see his men like bears shambling and shuffling
into their places, with little dancing movements of uncouth
playfulness and resentment, because of the pure cold.</p>

<p>Sweet, sweet it was to be marching beside his men, sweet to
hear the great thresh-thresh of their heavy boots in the
unblemished silence, sweet to feel the immense mass of living
bodies co-ordinated into oneness near him, to catch the hot waft
of their closeness, their breathing. Friedeburg was like a man
condemned to die, catching at every impression as at an
inestimable treasure.</p>

<p>Sweet it was to pass through the gates of the town, the
scanty, loose suburb, into the open darkness and space of the
country. This was almost best of all. It was like emerging in the
open plains of eternal freedom.</p>

<p>They saw a dark figure hobbling along under the dark side of a
shed. As they passed, through the open door of the shed, in the
golden light were seen the low rafters, the pale, silken sides of
the cows, evanescent. And a woman with a red kerchief bound round
her head lifted her face from the flank of the beast she was
milking, to look at the soldiers threshing like multitudes of
heavy ghosts down the darkness. Some of the men called to her,
cheerfully, impudently. Ah, the miraculous beauty and sweetness
of the merest trifles like these!</p>

<p>They tramped on down a frozen, rutty road, under lines of bare
trees. Beautiful trees! Beautiful frozen ruts in the road! Ah,
even, in one of the ruts there was a silver of ice and of
moon-glimpse. He heard ice tinkle as a passing soldier purposely
put his toe in it. What a sweet noise!</p>

<p>But there was a vague uneasiness. He heard the men arguing as
to whether dawn were coming. There was the silver moon, still
riding on the high seas of the sky. A lovely thing she was, a
jewel! But was there any blemish of day? He shrank a little from
the rawness of the day to come. This night of morning was so rare
and free.</p>

<p>Yes, he was sure. He saw a colourless paleness on the horizon.
The earth began to look hard, like a great, concrete shadow. He
shrank into himself. Glancing at the ranks of his men, he could
see them like a company of rhythmic ghosts. The pallor was
actually reflected on their livid faces. This was the coming day.
It frightened him.</p>

<p>The dawn came. He saw the rosiness of it hang trembling with
light, above the east. Then a strange glamour of scarlet passed
over the land. At his feet, glints of ice flashed scarlet, even
the hands of the men were red as they swung, sinister, heavy,
reddened.</p>

<p>The sun surged up, her rim appeared, swimming with fire,
hesitating, surging up. Suddenly there were shadows from trees
and ruts, and grass was hoar and ice was gold against the ebony
shadow. The faces of the men were alight, kindled with life. Ah,
it was magical, it was all too marvellous! If only it were always
like this!</p>

<p>When they stopped at the inn for breakfast, at nine o'clock,
the smell of the inn went raw and ugly to his heart: beer and
yesterday's tobacco!</p>

<p>He went to the door to look at the men biting huge bites from
their hunks of grey bread, or cutting off pieces with their
clasp-knives. This made him still happy. Women were going to the
fountain for water, the soldiers were chaffing them coarsely. He
liked all this.</p>

<p>But the magic was going, inevitably, the crystal delight was
thawing to desolation in his heart, his heart was cold, cold mud.
Ah, it was awful. His face contracted, he almost wept with cold,
stark despair.</p>

<p>Still he had the work, the day's hard activity with the men.
Whilst this lasted, he could live. But when this was over, and he
had to face the horror of his own cold-thawing mud of despair:
ah, it was not to be thought of. Still, he was happy at work with
the men: the wild desolate place, the hard activity of mock
warfare. Would to God it were real: war, with the prize of
death!</p>

<p>By afternoon the sky had gone one dead, livid level of grey.
It seemed low down, and oppressive. He was tired, the men were
tired, and this let the heavy cold soak in to them like despair.
Life could not keep it out.</p>

<p>And now, when his heart was so heavy it could sink no more, he
must glance at his own situation again. He must remember what a
fool he was, his new debts like half thawed mud in his heart. He
knew, with the cold misery of hopelessness, that he would be
turned out of the army. What then?--what then but death? After
all, death was the solution for him. Let it be so.</p>

<p>They marched on and on, stumbling with fatigue under a great
leaden sky, over a frozen dead country. The men were silent with
weariness, the heavy motion of their marching was like an
oppression. Friedeburg was tired too, and deadened, as his face
was deadened by the cold air. He did not think any more; the
misery of his soul was like a frost inside him.</p>

<p>He heard someone say it was going to snow. But the words had
no meaning for him. He marched as a clock ticks, with the same
monotony, everything numb and cold-soddened.</p>

<p>They were drawing near to the town. In the gloom of the
afternoon he felt it ahead, as unbearable oppression on him. Ah
the hideous suburb! What was his life, how did it come to pass
that life was lived in a formless, hideous grey structure of
hell! What did it all mean? Pale, sulphur-yellow lights spotted
the livid air, and people, like soddened shadows, passed in front
of the shops that were lit up ghastly in the early twilight. Out
of the colourless space, crumbs of snow came and bounced
animatedly off the breast of his coat.</p>

<p>At length he turned away home, to his room, to change and get
warm and renewed, for he felt as cold-soddened as the grey, cold,
heavy bread which felt hostile in the mouths of the soldiers. His
life was to him like this dead, cold bread in his mouth.</p>

<p>As he neared his own house, the snow was peppering thinly
down. He became aware of some unusual stir about the house-door.
He looked--a strange, closed-in wagon, people, police. The sword
of Damocles that had hung over his heart, fell. O God, a new
shame, some new shame, some new torture! His body moved on. So it
would move on through misery upon misery, as is our fate. There
was no emergence, only this progress through misery unto misery,
till the end. Strange, that human life was so tenacious! Strange,
that men had made of life a long, slow process of torture to the
soul. Strange, that it was no other than this! Strange, that but
for man, this misery would not exist. For it was not God's
misery, but the misery of the world of man.</p>

<p>He saw two officials push something white and heavy into the
cart, shut the doors behind with a bang, turn the silver handle,
and run round to the front of the wagon. It moved off. But still
most of the people lingered. Friedeburg drifted near in that
inevitable motion which carries us through all our shame and
torture. He knew the people talked about him. He went up the
steps and into the square hall.</p>

<p>There stood a police-officer, with a note-book in his hand,
talking to Herr Kapell, the housemaster. As Friedeburg entered
through the swing door, the housemaster, whose brow was wrinkled
in anxiety and perturbation, made a gesture with his hand, as if
to point out a criminal.</p>

<p>"Ah!--the Herr Baron von Friedeburg!" he said, in
self-exculpation.</p>

<p>The police officer turned, saluted politely, and said, with
the polite, intolerable <i>suffisance</i> of officialdom:</p>

<p>"Good evening! Trouble here!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Friedeburg.</p>

<p>He was so frightened, his sensitive constitution was so
lacerated, that something broke in him, he was a subservient,
murmuring ruin.</p>

<p>"Two young ladies found dead in your room," said the
police-official, making an official statement. But under his cold
impartiality of officialdom, what obscene unction! Ah, what
obscene exposures now!</p>

<p>"Dead!" ejaculated Friedeburg, with the wide eyes of a child.
He became quite child-like, the official had him completely in
his power. He could torture him as much as he liked.</p>

<p>"Yes." He referred to his note-book. "Asphyxiated by fumes
from the stove."</p>

<p>Friedeburg could only stand wide-eyed and meaningless.</p>

<p>"Please--will you go upstairs?"</p>

<p>The police-official marshalled Friedburg in front of himself.
The youth slowly mounted the stairs, feeling as if transfixed
through the base of the spine, as if he would lose the use of his
legs. The official followed close on his heels.</p>

<p>They reached the bedroom. The policeman unlocked the door. The
housekeeper followed with a lamp. Then the official examination
began.</p>

<p>"A young lady slept here last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Name, please?"</p>

<p>"Marta Hohenest."</p>

<p>"H-o-h-e-n-e-s-t," spelled the official. "--And address?"</p>

<p>Friedeburg continued to answer. This was the end of him. The
quick of him was pierced and killed. The living dead answered the
living dead in obscene antiphony. Question and answer continued,
the note-book worked as the hand of the old dead wrote in it the
replies of the young who was dead.</p>

<p>The room was unchanged from the night before. There was her
heap of clothing, the lustrous, pure-red dress lying soft where
she had carelessly dropped it. Even, on the edge of the
chair-back, her crimson silk garters hung looped.</p>

<p>But do not look, do not see. It is the business of the dead to
bury their dead. Let the young dead bury their own dead, as the
old dead have buried theirs. How can the dead remember, they
being dead? Only the living can remember, and are at peace with
their living who have passed away.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s10">THE OLD ADAM</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The maid who opened the door was just developing into a
handsome womanhood. Therefore she seemed to have the insolent
pride of one newly come to an inheritance. She would be a
splendid woman to look at, having just enough of Jewish blood to
enrich her comeliness into beauty. At nineteen her fine grey eyes
looked challenge, and her warm complexion, her black hair looped
up slack, enforced the sensuous folding of her mouth.</p>

<p>She wore no cap nor apron, but a well-looking sleeved overall
such as even very ladies don.</p>

<p>The man she opened to was tall and thin, but graceful in his
energy. He wore white flannels, carried a tennis-racket. With a
light bow to the maid he stepped beside her on the threshold. He
was one of those who attract by their movement, whose movement is
watched unconsciously, as we watch the flight of a sea-bird
waving its wing leisurely. Instead of entering the house, the
young man stood beside the maid-servant and looked back into the
blackish evening. When in repose, he had the diffident, ironic
bearing so remarkable in the educated youth of to-day, the very
reverse of that traditional aggressiveness of youth.</p>

<p>"It is going to thunder, Kate," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it is," she replied, on an even footing.</p>

<p>The young man stood a moment looking at the trees across the
road, and on the oppressive twilight.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, "there's not a trace of colour in the
atmosphere, though it's sunset; all a dark, lustrous grey; and
those oaks kindle green like a low fire--see!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kate, rather awkwardly.</p>

<p>"A troublesome sort of evening; must be, because it's your
last with us."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, flushing and hardening.</p>

<p>There was another pause; then:</p>

<p>"Sorry you're going?" he asked, with a faint tang of
irony.</p>

<p>"In some ways," she replied, rather haughtily.</p>

<p>He laughed, as if he understood what was not said, then, with
an "Ah well!" he passed along the hall.</p>

<p>The maid stood for a few moments clenching her young fists,
clenching her very breast in revolt. Then she closed the
door.</p>

<p>Edward Severn went into the dining-room. It was eight o'clock,
very dark for a June evening; on the dusk-blue walls only the
gilt frames of the pictures glinted pale. The clock occupied the
room with its delicate ticking.</p>

<p>The door opened into a tiny conservatory that was lined with a
grapevine. Severn could hear, from the garden beyond, the high
prattling of a child. He went to the glass door.</p>

<p>Running down the grass by the flower-border was a little girl
of three, dressed in white. She was very bonny, very quick and
intent in her movements; she reminded him of a fieldmouse which
plays alone in the corn, for sheer joy. Severn lounged in the
doorway, watching her. Suddenly she perceived him. She started,
flashed into greeting, gave a little gay jump, and stood quite
still again, as if pleading.</p>

<p>"Mr. Severn," she cried, in wonderfully coaxing tones: "Come
and see this."</p>

<p>"What?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Com' and see it," she pleaded.</p>

<p>He laughed, knowing she only wanted to coax him into the
garden; and he went.</p>

<p>"Look," she said, spreading out her plump little arm.</p>

<p>"What?" he asked.</p>

<p>The baby was not going to admit that she had tricked him
thither for her amusement.</p>

<p>"All gone up to buds," she said, pointing to the closed
marigolds. Then "See!" she shrieked, flinging herself at his
legs, grasping the flannel of his trousers, and tugging at him
wildly. She was a wild little M&aelig;nad. She flew shrieking
like a revelling bird down the garden, glancing back to see if he
were coming. He had not the heart to desist, but went swiftly
after her. In the obscure garden, the two white figures darted
through the flowering plants, the baby, with her full silk
skirts, scudding like a ruffled bird, the man, lithe and fleet,
snatching her up and smothering his face in hers. And all the
time her piercing voice reechoed from his low calls of warning
and of triumph as he hunted her. Often she was really frightened
of him; then she clung fast round his neck, and he laughed and
mocked her in a low, stirring voice, whilst she protested.</p>

<p>The garden was large for a London suburb. It was shut in by a
high dark embankment, that rose above a row of black poplar
trees. And over the spires of the trees, high up, slid by the
golden-lighted trains, with the soft movement of caterpillars and
a hoarse, subtle noise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas stood in the dark doorway watching the night, the
trains, the flash and run of the two white figures.</p>

<p>"And now we must go in," she heard Severn say.</p>

<p>"No," cried the baby, wild and defiant as a bacchanal. She
clung to him like a wild-cat.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Where's your mother?"</p>

<p>"Give me a swing," demanded the child.</p>

<p>He caught her up. She strangled him hard with her young
arms.</p>

<p>"I said, where's your mother?" he persisted, half
smothered.</p>

<p>"She's op'tairs," shouted the child. "Give me a swing."</p>

<p>"I don't think she is," said Severn.</p>

<p>"She is. Give me a swing, a swi-i-ing!"</p>

<p>He bent forward, so that she hung from his neck like a great
pendant. Then he swung her, laughing low to himself while she
shrieked with fear. As she slipped he caught her to his
breast.</p>

<p>"Mary!" called Mrs. Thomas, in that low, songful tone of a
woman when her heart is roused and happy.</p>

<p>"Mary!" she called, long and sweet.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried the child quickly.</p>

<p>But Severn bore her off. Laughing, he bowed his head and
offered to the mother the baby who clung round his neck.</p>

<p>"Come along here," said Mrs. Thomas roguishly, clasping the
baby's waist with her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," cried the child, tucking her head into the young
man's neck.</p>

<p>"But it's bed-time," said the mother. She laughed as she drew
at the child to pull her loose from Severn. The baby clung
tighter, and laughed, feeling no determination in her mother's
grip. Severn bent his head to loosen the child's hold, bowed, and
swung the heavy baby on his neck. The child clung to him,
bubbling with laughter; the mother drew at her baby, laughing
low, while the man swung gracefully, giving little jerks of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Let Mr. Severn undress me," said the child, hugging close to
the young man, who had come to lodge with her parents when she
was scarce a month old.</p>

<p>"You're in high favour to-night," said the mother to Severn.
He laughed, and all three stood a moment watching the trains pass
and repass in the sky beyond the garden-end. Then they went
indoors, and Severn undressed the child.</p>

<p>She was a beautiful girl, a bacchanal with her wild, dull-gold
hair tossing about like a loose chaplet, her hazel eyes shining
daringly, her small, spaced teeth glistening in little passions
of laughter within her red, small mouth. The young man loved her.
She was such a little bright wave of wilfulness, so abandoned to
her impulses, so white and smooth as she lay at rest, so
startling as she flashed her naked limbs about. But she was
growing too old for a young man to undress.</p>

<p>She sat on his knee in her high-waisted night-gown, eating her
piece of bread-and-butter with savage little bites of resentment:
she did not want to go to bed. But Severn made her repeat a Pater
Noster. She lisped over the Latin, and Mrs. Thomas, listening,
flushed with pleasure; although she was a Protestant, and
although she deplored the unbelief of Severn, who had been a
Catholic.</p>

<p>The mother took the baby to carry her to bed. Mrs. Thomas was
thirty-four years old, full-bosomed and ripe. She had dark hair
that twined lightly round her low, white brow. She had a clear
complexion, and beautiful brows, and dark-blue eyes. The lower
part of her face was heavy.</p>

<p>"Kiss me," said Severn to the child.</p>

<p>He raised his face as he sat in the rocking-chair. The mother
stood beside, looking down at him, and holding the laughing rogue
of a baby against her breast. The man's face was uptilted, his
heavy brows set back from the laughing tenderness of his eyes,
which looked dark, because the pupil was dilated. He pursed up
his handsome mouth, his thick close-cut moustache roused.</p>

<p>He was a man who gave tenderness, but who did not ask for it.
All his own troubles he kept, laughingly, to himself. But his
eyes were very sad when quiet, and he was too quick to understand
sorrow, not to know it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas watched his fine mouth lifted for kissing. She
leaned forward, lowering the baby, and suddenly, by a quick
change in his eyes, she knew he was aware of her heavy woman's
breasts approaching down to him. The wild rogue of a baby bent
her face to his, and then, instead of kissing him, suddenly
licked his cheek with her wet, soft tongue. He started back in
aversion, and his eyes and his teeth flashed with a dangerous
laugh.</p>

<p>"No, no," he laughed, in low strangled tones. "No dog-lick, my
dear, oh no!"</p>

<p>The baby chuckled with glee, gave one wicked jerk of laughter,
that came out like a bubble escaping.</p>

<p>He put up his mouth again, and again his face was horizontal
below the face of the young mother. She looked down on him as if
by a kind of fascination.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, then," he said with thick throat.</p>

<p>The mother lowered the baby. She felt scarcely sure of her
balance. Again the child, when near to his face, darted out her
tongue to lick him. He swiftly averted his face, laughing in his
throat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas turned her face aside; she would see no more.</p>

<p>"Come then," she said to the child. "If you won't kiss Mr.
Severn nicely--"</p>

<p>The child laughed over the mother's shoulder like a squirrel
crouched there. She was carried to bed.</p>

<p>It was still not quite dark; the clouds had opened slightly.
The young man flung himself into an arm-chair, with a volume of
French verse. He read one lyric, then he lay still.</p>

<p>"What, all in the dark!" exclaimed Mrs. Thomas, coming in.
"And reading by <i>this</i> light." She rebuked him with timid
affectionateness. Then, glancing at his white-flannelled limbs
sprawled out in the gloom, she went to the door. There she turned
her back to him, looking out.</p>

<p>"Don't these flags smell strongly in the evening?" she said at
length.</p>

<p>He replied with a few lines of the French he had been
reading.</p>

<p>She did not understand. There was a peculiar silence.</p>

<p>"A peculiar, brutal, carnal scent, iris," he drawled at
length. "Isn't it?"</p>

<p>She laughed shortly, saying: "Eh, I don't know about
that."</p>

<p>"It is," he asserted calmly.</p>

<p>He rose from his chair, went to stand beside her at the
door.</p>

<p>There was a great sheaf of yellow iris near the window.
Farther off, in the last twilight, a gang of enormous poppies
balanced and flapped their gold-scarlet, which even the darkness
could not quite put out.</p>

<p>"We ought to be feeling very sad," she said after a while.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well--isn't it Kate's last night?" she said, slightly
mocking.</p>

<p>"She's a tartar, Kate," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's too rude, she is really! The way she criticises the
things you do, and her insolence--"</p>

<p>"The things <i>I</i> do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no; you can't do anything wrong. It's the things <i>I</i>
do." Mrs. Thomas sounded very much incensed.</p>

<p>"Poor Kate, she'll have to lower her key," said Severn.</p>

<p>"Indeed she will, and a good thing too."</p>

<p>There was silence again.</p>

<p>"It's lightning," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Where?" she asked, with a suddenness that surprised him. She
turned, met his eyes for a second. He sank his head, abashed.</p>

<p>"Over there in the north-east," he said, keeping his face from
her. She watched his hand rather than the sky.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said uninterestedly.</p>

<p>"The storm will wheel round, you'll see," he said.</p>

<p>"I hope it wheels the other way, then."</p>

<p>"Well, it won't. You don't like lightning, do you? You'd even
have to take refuge with Kate if I weren't here."</p>

<p>She laughed quietly at his irony.</p>

<p>"No," she said, quite bitterly. "Mr. Thomas is never in when
he's wanted."</p>

<p>"Well, as he won't be urgently required, we'll acquit him,
eh?"</p>

<p>At that moment a white flash fell across the blackness. They
looked at each other, laughing. The thunder came broken and
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I think we'll shut the door," said Mrs. Thomas, in normal,
sufficiently distant tones. A strong woman, she locked and bolted
the stiff fastenings easily. Severn pressed on the light. Mrs.
Thomas noticed the untidiness of the room. She rang, and
presently Kate appeared.</p>

<p>"Will you clear baby's things away?" she said, in the
contemptuous tone of a hostile woman. Without answering, and in
her superb, unhastening way, Kate began to gather up the small
garments. Both women were aware of the observant, white figure of
the man standing on the hearth. Severn balanced with a fine, easy
poise, and smiled to himself, exulting a little to see the two
women in this state of hostility. Kate moved about with bowed
defiant head. Severn watched her curiously; he could not
understand her. And she was leaving to-morrow. When she had gone
out of the room, he remained still standing, thinking. Something
in his lithe, vigorous balance, so alert, and white, and
independent, caused Mrs. Thomas to glance at him from her
sewing.</p>

<p>"I will let the blinds down," he said, becoming aware that he
was attracting attention.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she replied conventionally.</p>

<p>He let the lattice blinds down, then flung himself into his
chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas sat at the table, near him, sewing. She was a
good-looking woman, well made. She sat under the one light that
was turned on. The lamp-shade was of red silk lined with yellow.
She sat in the warm-gold light. There was established between the
two a peculiar silence, like suspense, almost painful to each of
them, yet which neither would break. Severn listened to the snap
of her needle, looked from the movement of her hand to the
window, where the lightning beat and fluttered through the
lattice. The thunder was as yet far off.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, "at the lightning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas started at the sound of his voice, and some of the
colour went from her face. She turned to the window.</p>

<p>There, between the cracks of the Venetian blinds, came the
white flare of lightning, then the dark. Several storms were in
the sky. Scarcely had one sudden glare fluttered and palpitated
out, than another covered the window with white. It dropped, and
another flew up, beat like a moth for a moment, then vanished.
Thunder met and overlapped; two battles were fought together in
the sky.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas went very pale. She tried not to look at the
window, yet, when she felt the lightning blench the lamplight,
she watched, and each time a flash leaped on the window, she
shuddered. Severn, all unconsciously, was smiling with roused
eyes.</p>

<p>"You don't like it?" he said, at last, gently.</p>

<p>"Not much," she answered, and he laughed.</p>

<p>"Yet all the storms are a fair way off," he said. "Not one
near enough to touch us."</p>

<p>"No, but," she replied, at last laying her hands in her lap,
and turning to him, "it makes me feel worked up. You don't know
how it makes me feel, as if I couldn't contain myself."</p>

<p>She made a helpless gesture with her hand. He was watching her
closely. She seemed to him pathetically helpless and bewildered;
she was eight years older than he. He smiled in a strange, alert
fashion, like a man who feels in jeopardy. She bent over her
work, stitching nervously. There was a silence in which neither
of them could breathe freely.</p>

<p>Presently a bigger flash than usual whitened through the
yellow lamplight. Both glanced at the window, then at each other.
For a moment it was a look of greeting; then his eyes dilated to
a smile, wide with recklessness. He felt her waver, lose her
composure, become incoherent. Seeing the faint helplessness of
coming tears, he felt his heart thud to a crisis. She had her
face at her sewing.</p>

<p>Severn sank in his chair, half suffocated by the beating of
his heart. Yet, time after time, as the flashes came, they looked
at each other, till in the end they both were panting, and
afraid, not of the lightning but of themselves and of each
other.</p>

<p>He was so much moved that he became conscious of his
perturbation. "What the deuce is up?" he asked himself,
wondering. At twenty-seven, he was quite chaste. Being highly
civilised, he prized women for their intuition, and because of
the delicacy with which he could transfer to them his thoughts
and feelings, without cumbrous argument. From this to a state of
passion he could only proceed by fine gradations, and such a
procedure he had never begun. Now he was startled, astonished,
perturbed, yet still scarcely conscious of his whereabouts. There
was a pain in his chest that made him pant, and an involuntary
tension in his arms, as if he must press someone to his breast.
But the idea that this someone was Mrs. Thomas would have shocked
him too much had he formed it. His passion had run on
subconsciously, till now it had come to such a pitch it must drag
his conscious soul into allegiance. This, however, would probably
never happen; he would not yield allegiance, and blind emotion,
in this direction, could not carry him alone.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock Mr. Thomas came in.</p>

<p>"I wonder you come home at all," Severn heard Mrs. Thomas say
as her husband stepped indoors.</p>

<p>"I left the office at half-past ten," the voice of Thomas
replied, disagreeably.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't try to tell me that old tale," the woman answered
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I didn't try anything at all, Gertie," he replied with
sarcasm. "Your question was answered."</p>

<p>Severn imagined him bowing with affected, magisterial dignity,
and he smiled. Mr. Thomas was something in the law.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas left her husband in the hall, came and sat down
again at table, where she and Severn had just finished supper,
both of them reading the while.</p>

<p>Thomas came in, flushed very red. He was of middle stature, a
thickly-built man of forty, good-looking. But he had grown
round-shouldered with thrusting forward his chin in order to look
the aggressive, strong-jawed man. He <i>had</i> a good jaw; but
his mouth was small and nervously pinched. His brown eyes were of
the emotional, affectionate sort, lacking pride or any
austerity.</p>

<p>He did not speak to Severn nor Severn to him. Although as a
rule the two men were very friendly, there came these times when,
for no reason whatever, they were sullenly hostile. Thomas sat
down heavily, and reached his bottle of beer. His hands were
thick, and in their movement rudimentary. Severn watched the
thick fingers grasp the drinking-glass as if it were a
treacherous enemy.</p>

<p>"Have you <i>had</i> supper, Gertie?" he asked, in tones that
sounded like an insult. He could not bear that these two should
sit reading as if he did not exist.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, looking up at him in impatient surprise.
"It's late enough." Then she buried herself again in her
book.</p>

<p>Severn ducked low and grinned. Thomas swallowed a mouthful of
beer.</p>

<p>"I wish you could answer my questions, Gertie, without
superfluous detail," he said nastily, thrusting out his chin at
her as if cross-examining.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said indifferently, not looking up. "Wasn't my
answer right, then?"</p>

<p>"Quite--I thank you," he answered, bowing with great sarcasm.
It was utterly lost on his wife.</p>

<p>"Hm-hm!" she murmured in abstraction, continuing to read.</p>

<p>Silence resumed. Severn was grinning to himself,
chuckling.</p>

<p>"I <i>had</i> a compliment paid me to-night, Gertie," said
Thomas, quite amicably, after a while. He still ignored
Severn.</p>

<p>"Hm-hm!" murmured his wife. This was a well-known beginning.
Thomas valiantly struggled on with his courtship of his wife,
swallowing his spleen.</p>

<p>"Councillor Jarndyce, in full committee--Are you listening,
Gertie?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, looking up for a moment.</p>

<p>"You know Councillor Jarndyce's style," Thomas continued, in
the tone of a man determined to be patient and affable: "--the
courteous Old English Gentleman--"</p>

<p>"Hm-hm!" replied Mrs. Thomas.</p>

<p>"He was speaking in reply to . . ." Thomas gave innumerable
wearisome details, which no one heeded.</p>

<p>"Then he bowed to me, then to the Chairman--'I am compelled to
say, Mr. Chairman, that we have <i>one</i> cause for
congratulation; we are inestimably fortunate in <i>one</i> member
of our staff; there is one point of which we can always be
sure--the point of <i>law</i>; and it is an important point, Mr.
Chairman.'</p>

<p>"He bowed to the Chairman, he bowed to me. And you should have
heard the applause all round that Council Chamber--that great,
horseshoe table, you don't know how impressive it is. And every
face turned to me, and all round the board: 'Hear--Hear!' You
don't know what respect I command in <i>business</i>, Mrs.
Thomas."</p>

<p>"Then let it suffice you," said Mrs. Thomas, calmly
indifferent.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas bit his bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>"The fat-head's had two drops of Scotch, so he's drawing on
his imagination," thought Severn chuckling deeply.</p>

<p>"I thought you said there was no meeting to-night," Mrs.
Thomas suddenly and innocently remarked after a while.</p>

<p>"There was a meeting, <i>in camera</i>," replied her husband,
drawing himself up with official dignity. His excessive and
wounded dignity convulsed Severn; the lie disgusted Mrs. Thomas
in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Presently Thomas, always courting his wife and insultingly
overlooking Severn, raised a point of politics, passed a lordly
opinion very offensive to the young man. Severn had risen,
stretched himself, and laid down his book. He was leaning on the
mantelpiece in an indifferent manner, as if he scarcely noticed
the two talkers. But hearing Thomas pronounce like a boor upon
the Woman's Bill, he roused himself, and coolly contradicted his
landlord. Mrs. Thomas shot a look of joy at the white-clad young
man who lounged so scornfully on the hearth. Thomas cracked his
knuckles one after another, and lowered his brown eyes, which
were full of hate. After a sufficient pause, for his timidity was
stronger than his impulse, he replied with a phrase that sounded
final. Severn flipped the sense out of it with a few words. In
the argument Severn, more cultured and far more nimble-witted
than his antagonist, who hauled up his answers with a lawyer's
show of invincibility, but who had not any fineness of
perception, merely spiked his opponent's pieces and smiled at
him. Also the young man enjoyed himself by looking down
scornfully, straight into the brown eyes of his senior all the
time, so that Thomas writhed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas, meantime, took her husband's side against women,
without reserve. Severn was angry; he was scornfully angry with
her. Mrs. Thomas glanced at him from time to time, a little
ecstasy lighting her fine blue eyes. The irony of her part was
delicious to her. If she had sided with Severn, that young man
would have pitied the forlorn man, and been gentle with him.</p>

<p>The battle of words had got quieter and more intense. Mrs.
Thomas made no move to check it. At last Severn was aware he and
Thomas were both getting overheated. Thomas had doubled and
dodged painfully, like a half-frenzied rabbit that will not
realise it is trapped. Finally his efforts had moved even his
opponent to pity. Mrs. Thomas was not pitiful. She scorned her
husband's dexterity of argument, when his intellectual dishonesty
was so evident to her. Severn uttered his last phrases, and would
say no more. Then Thomas cracked his knuckles one after the
other, turned aside, consumed with morbid humiliation, and there
was silence.</p>

<p>"I will go to bed," said Severn. He would have spoken some
conciliatory words to his landlord; he lingered with that
purpose; but he could not bring his throat to utter his
purpose.</p>

<p>"Oh, before you go, do you mind, Mr. Severn, helping Mr.
Thomas down with Kate's box? You may be gone before he's up in
the morning, and the cab comes at ten. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?" replied Severn.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Joe?" she asked her husband.</p>

<p>Thomas rose with the air of a man who represses himself and is
determined to be patient.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"On the top landing. I'll tell Kate, and then we shan't
frighten her. She has gone to bed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas was quite mistress of the situation; both men were
humble before her. She led the way, with a candle, to the third
floor. There on the little landing, outside the closed door,
stood a large tin trunk. The three were silent because of the
baby.</p>

<p>"Poor Kate," Severn thought. "It's a shame to kick her out
into the world, and all for nothing." He felt an impulse of hate
towards womankind.</p>

<p>"Shall I go first, Mr. Severn?" asked Thomas.</p>

<p>It was surprising how friendly the two men were, as soon as
they had something to do together, or when Mrs. Thomas was
absent. Then they were comrades, Thomas, the elder, the
thick-set, playing the protector's part, though always
deferential to the younger, whimsical man.</p>

<p>"I had better go first," said Thomas kindly. "And if you put
this round the handle, it won't cut your fingers."</p>

<p>He offered the young man a little flexible book from his
pocket. Severn had such small, fine hands that Thomas pitied
them.</p>

<p>Severn raised one end of the trunk. Leaning back, and flashing
a smile to Mrs. Thomas, who stood with the candle, he whispered:
"Kate's got a lot more impediments than I have."</p>

<p>"I know it's heavy," laughed Mrs. Thomas.</p>

<p>Thomas, waiting at the brink of the stairs, saw the young man
tilting his bare throat towards the smiling woman, and whispering
words which pleased her.</p>

<p>"At your pleasure, sir," he said in his most grating and
official tones.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Severn flung out scornfully.</p>

<p>The elder man retreated very cautiously, stiffly lowering
himself down one stair, looking anxiously behind.</p>

<p>"Are you holding the light for <i>me</i>, Gertie?" he snapped
sarcastically, when he had managed one stair. She lifted the
candle with a swoop. He was in a bustle and a funk, Severn,
always indifferent, smiled slightly, and lowered the box with
negligent ease of movement. As a matter of fact, three-quarters
of the heavy weight: pressed on Thomas. Mrs. Thomas watched the
two figures from above.</p>

<p>"If I slip now," thought Severn, as he noticed the anxious,
red face of his landlord, "I should squash him like a shrimp,"
and he laughed to himself.</p>

<p>"Don't come yet," he called softly to Mrs. Thomas, whom he
heard following. "If you slip, your husband's bottom-most under
the smash. 'Beware the fearful avalanche!'"</p>

<p>He laughed, and Mrs. Thomas gave a little chuckle. Thomas,
very red and flustered, glanced irritably back at them, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the staircase there was a twist in the
stairs. Severn was feeling particularly reckless. When he came to
the turn, he chuckled to himself, feeling his house-slippers
unsafe on the narrowed, triangular stairs. He loved a risk above
all things, and a subconscious instinct made the risk doubly
sweet when his rival was under the box. Though Severn would not
knowingly have hurt a hair of his landlord's head.</p>

<p>When Thomas was beginning to sweat with relief, being only one
step from the landing, Severn did slip, quite accidentally. The
great box crashed as if in pain, Severn glissaded down the
stairs. Thomas was flung backwards across the landing, and his
head went thud against the banister post. Severn, seeing no great
harm done, was struggling to his feet, laughing and saying: "I'm
awfully sorry--" when Thomas got up. The elder man was infuriated
like a bull. He saw the laughing face of Severn and he went mad.
His brown eyes flared.</p>

<p>"You ----, you did it on purpose!" he shouted, and straightway
he fetched the young man two heavy blows, upon the jaw and ear.
Thomas, a footballer and a boxer in his youth, had been brought
up among the roughs of Swansea; Severn in a religious college in
France. The young man had never been struck in the face before.
He instantly went white and mad with rage. Thomas stood on guard,
fists up. But on the small, lumbered landing there was no room
for fight. Moreover, Severn had no instinct of fisticuffs. With
open, stiff fingers, the young man sprang on his adversary. In
spite of the blow he received, but did not feel, he flung himself
again forward, and then, catching Thomas's collar, brought him
down with a crash. Instantly his exquisite hands were dug in the
other's thick throat, the linen collar having been torn open.
Thomas fought madly, with blind, brute strength. But the other
lay wrapped on him like a white steel, his rare intelligence
concentrated, not scattered; concentrated on strangling Thomas
swiftly. He pressed forward, forcing his landlord's head over the
edge of the next flight of stairs. Thomas, stout and
full-blooded, lost every trace of self-possession; he struggled
like an animal at slaughter. The blood came out of his nose over
his face; he made horrid choking sounds as he struggled.</p>

<p>Suddenly Severn felt his face turned between two hands. With a
shock of real agony, he met the eyes of Kate. She bent forward,
she captured his eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you think you're doing?" she cried in frenzy of
indignation. She leaned over him in her night-dress, her two
black plaits hanging perpendicular. He hid his face, and took his
hands away. As he kneeled to rise, he glanced up the stairs. Mrs.
Thomas stood against the banisters, motionless in a trance of
horror and remorse. He saw the remorse plainly. Severn turned
away his face, and was wild with shame. He saw his landlord
kneeling, his hands at his throat, choking, rattling, and
gasping. The young man's heart filled with remorse and grief. He
put his arms round the heavy man, and raised him, saying
tenderly:</p>

<p>"Let me help you up."</p>

<p>He had got Thomas up against the wall, when the choked man
began to slide down again in collapse, gasping all the time
pitifully.</p>

<p>"No, stand up; you're best standing up," commanded Severn
sharply, rearing his landlord up again. Thomas managed to obey,
stupidly. His nose still bled, he still held his throat and
gasped with a crowing sound. But his breathing was getting
deeper.</p>

<p>"Water, Kate--and sponge--cold," said Severn.</p>

<p>Kate was back in an instant. The young man bathed his
landlord's face and temples and throat. The bleeding ceased
directly, the stout man's breathing became a series of irregular,
jerky gasps, like a child that has been sobbing hard. At last he
took a long breath, and his breast settled into regular stroke,
with little fluttering interruptions. Still holding his hand to
his throat, he looked up with dazed, piteous brown eyes, mutely
wretched and appealing. He moved his tongue as if to try it, put
back his head a little, and moved the muscles of his throat. Then
he replaced his hands on the place that ached.</p>

<p>Severn was grief-stricken. He would willingly, at that moment,
have given his right hand for the man he had hurt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas, meanwhile, stood on the stairs, watching: for a
long time she dared not move, knowing she would sink down. She
watched. One of the crises of her life was passing. Full of
remorse, she passed over into the bitter land of repentance. She
must no longer allow herself to hope for anything for herself.
The rest of her life must be spent in self-abnegation: she must
seek for no sympathy, must ask for no grace in love, no grace and
harmony in living. Henceforward, as far as her own desires went,
she was dead. She took a fierce joy in the anguish of it.</p>

<p>"Do you feel better?" Severn asked of the sick man. Thomas
looked at the questioner with tragic brown eyes, in which was no
anger, only mute self-pity. He did not answer, but looked like a
wounded animal, very pitiable. Mrs. Thomas quickly repressed an
impulse of impatient scorn, replacing it with a numb, abstract
sense of duty, lofty and cold.</p>

<p>"Come," said Severn, full of pity, and gentle as a woman. "Let
me help you to bed."</p>

<p>Thomas, leaning heavily on the young man, whose white garments
were dabbed with blood and water, stumbled forlornly into his
room. There Severn unlaced his boots and got off the remnant of
his collar. At this point Mrs. Thomas came in. She had taken her
part; she was weeping also.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Severn," she said coldly. Severn, dismissed,
slunk out of the room. She went up to her husband, took his
pathetic head upon her bosom, and pressed it there. As Severn
went downstairs, he heard the few sobs of the husband, among the
quick sniffing of the wife's tears. And he saw Kate, who had
stood on the stairs to see all went well, climb up to her room
with cold, calm face.</p>

<p>He locked up the house, put everything in order. Then he
heated some water to bathe his face, which was swelling
painfully. Having finished his fomentations, he sat thinking
bitterly, with a good deal of shame.</p>

<p>As he sat, Mrs. Thomas came down for something. Her bearing
was cold and hostile. She glanced round to see all was safe.
Then:</p>

<p>"You will put out the light when you go to bed, Mr. Severn,"
she said, more formally than a landlady at the seaside would
speak. He was insulted: any ordinary being would turn off the
light on retiring. Moreover, almost every night it was he who
locked up the house, and came last to bed.</p>

<p>"I will, Mrs. Thomas," he answered. He bowed, his eyes
flickering with irony, because he knew his face was swollen.</p>

<p>She returned again after having reached the landing.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you wouldn't mind helping <i>me</i> down with the
box," she said, quietly and coldly. He did not reply, as he would
have done an hour before, that he certainly should not help her,
because it was a man's job, and she must not do it. Now, he rose,
bowed, and went upstairs with her. Taking the greater part of the
weight, he came quickly downstairs with the load.</p>

<p>"Thank you; it's very good of you. Good-night," said Mrs.
Thomas, and she retired.</p>

<p>In the morning Severn rose late. His face was considerably
swollen. He went in his dressing-gown across to Thomas's room.
The other man lay in bed, looking much the same as ever, but
mournful in aspect, though pleased within himself at being
coddled.</p>

<p>"How are you this morning?" Severn asked.</p>

<p>Thomas smiled, looked almost with tenderness up at his
friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right, thanks," he replied.</p>

<p>He looked at the other's swollen and bruised cheek, then
again, affectionately, into Severn's eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry"--with a glance of indication--"for that," he said
simply. Severn smiled with his eyes, in his own winsome
manner.</p>

<p>"I didn't know we were such essential brutes," he said. "I
thought I was so civilised . . ."</p>

<p>Again he smiled, with a wry, stiff mouth. Thomas gave a
deprecating little grunt of a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he said. "It shows a man's got some fight
in him."</p>

<p>He looked up in the other's face appealingly. Severn smiled,
with a touch of bitterness. The two men grasped hands.</p>

<p>To the end of their acquaintance, Severn and Thomas were close
friends, with a gentleness in their bearing, one towards the
other. On the other hand, Mrs. Thomas was only polite and formal
with Severn, treating him as if he were a stranger.</p>

<p>Kate, her fate disposed of by her "betters", passed out of
their three lives.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s11">THE OVERTONE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>His wife was talking to two other women. He lay on the lounge
pretending to read. The lamps shed a golden light, and, through
the open door, the night was lustrous, and a white moon went like
a woman, unashamed and naked across the sky. His wife, her dark
hair tinged with grey looped low on her white neck, fingered as
she talked the pearl that hung in a heavy, naked drop against the
bosom of her dress. She was still a beautiful woman, and one who
dressed like the night, for harmony. Her gown was of silk lace,
all in flakes, as if the fallen, pressed petals of black and
faded-red poppies were netted together with gossamer about her.
She was fifty-one, and he was fifty-two. It seemed impossible. He
felt his love cling round her like her dress, like a garment of
dead leaves. She was talking to a quiet woman about the suffrage.
The other girl, tall, rather aloof, sat listening in her chair,
with the posture of one who neither accepts nor rejects, but who
allows things to go on around her, and will know what she thinks
only when she must act. She seemed to be looking away into the
night. A scent of honeysuckle came through the open door. Then a
large grey moth blundered into the light.</p>

<p>It was very still, almost too silent, inside the room. Mrs.
Renshaw's quiet, musical voice continued:</p>

<p>"But think of a case like Mrs. Mann's now. She is a clever
woman. If she had slept in my cradle, and I in hers, she would
have looked a greater lady than I do at this minute. But she
married Mann, and she has seven children by him, and goes out
charring. Her children she can never leave. So she must stay with
a dirty, drunken brute like Mann. If she had an income of two
pounds a week, she could say to him: 'Sir, good-bye to you,' and
she would be well rid. But no, she is tied to him for ever."</p>

<p>They were discussing the State-endowment of mothers. She and
Mrs. Hankin were bitterly keen upon it. Elsa Laskell sat and
accepted their talk as she did the scent of the honeysuckle or
the blundering adventure of the moth round the silk: it came
burdened, not with the meaning of the words, but with the feeling
of the woman's heart as she spoke. Perhaps she heard a
nightingale in the park outside--perhaps she did. And then this
talk inside drifted also to the girl's heart, like a sort of
inarticulate music. Then she was vaguely aware of the man
sprawled in his homespun suit upon the lounge. He had not changed
for dinner: he was called unconventional.</p>

<p>She knew he was old enough to be her father, and yet he looked
young enough to be her lover. They all seemed young, the
beautiful hostess, too, but with a meaningless youth that cannot
ripen, like an unfertilised flower which lasts a long time. He
was a man she classed as a Dane--with fair, almost sandy hair,
blue eyes, long loose limbs, and a boyish activity. But he was
fifty-two--and he lay looking out on the night, with one of his
hands swollen from hanging so long inert, silent. The women bored
him.</p>

<p>Elsa Laskell sat in a sort of dreamy state, and the feelings
of her hostess, and the feeling of her host drifted like
iridesence upon the quick of her soul, among the white touch of
that moon out there, and the exotic heaviness of the honeysuckle,
and the strange flapping of the moth. So still, it was, behind
the murmur of talk: a silence of being. Of the third woman, Mrs
Hankin, the girl had no sensibility. But the night and the moon,
the moth, Will Renshaw and Edith Renshaw and herself were all in
full being, a harmony.</p>

<p>To him it was six months after his marriage, and the sky was
the same, and the honeysuckle in the air. He was living again his
crisis, as we all must, fretting and fretting against our
failure, till we have worn away the thread of our life. It was
six months after his marriage, and they were down at the little
bungalow on the bank of the Soar. They were comparatively poor,
though her father was rich, and his was well-to-do. And they were
alone in the little two-roomed bungalow that stood on its wild
bank over the river, among the honeysuckle bushes. He had cooked
the evening meal, they had eaten the omelette and drank the
coffee, and all was settling into stillness.</p>

<p>He sat outside, by the remnants of the fire, looking at the
country lying level and lustrous grey opposite him. Trees hung
like vapour in a perfect calm under the moonlight. And that was
the moon so perfectly naked and unfaltering, going her errand
simply through the night. And that was the river faintly
rustling. And there, down the darkness, he saw a flashing of
activity white betwixt black twigs. It was the water mingling and
thrilling with the moon. So! It made him quiver, and reminded him
of the starlit rush of a hare. There was vividness then in all
this lucid night, things flashing and quivering with being,
almost as the soul quivers in the darkness of the eye. He could
feel it. The night's great circle was the pupil of an eye, full
of the mystery, and the unknown fire of life, that does not burn
away, but flickers unquenchable.</p>

<p>So he rose, and went to look for his wife. She sat with her
dark head bent into the light of a reading lamp, in the little
hut. She wore a white dress, and he could see her shoulders'
softness and curve through the lawn. Yet she did not look up when
he moved. He stood in the doorway, knowing that she felt his
presence. Yet she gave no sign.</p>

<p>"Will you come out?" he asked.</p>

<p>She looked up at him as if to find out what he wanted, and she
was rather cold to him. But when he had repeated his request, she
had risen slowly to acquiesce, and a tiny shiver had passed down
her shoulders. So he unhung from its peg her beautiful Paisley
shawl, with its tempered colours that looked as if they had
faltered through the years and now were here in their essence,
and put it round her. They sat again outside the little hut,
under the moonlight. He held both her hands. They were heavy with
rings. But one ring was his wedding ring. He had married her, and
there was nothing more to own. He owned her, and the night was
the pupil of her eye, in which was everything. He kissed her
fingers, but she sat and made no sign. It was as he wished. He
kissed her fingers again.</p>

<p>Then a corncrake began to call in the meadow across the river,
a strange, dispassionate sound, that made him feel not quite
satisfied, not quite sure. It was not all achieved. The moon, in
her white and naked candour, was beyond him. He felt a little
numbness, as one who has gloves on. He could not feel that clear,
clean moon. There was something betwixt him and her, as if he had
gloves on. Yet he ached for the clear touch, skin to skin--even
of the moonlight. He wanted a further purity, a newer cleanness
and nakedness. The corncrake cried too. And he watched the moon,
and he watched her light on his hands. It was like a butterfly on
his glove, that he could see, but not feel. And he wanted to
unglove himself. Quite clear, quite, quite bare to the moon, the
touch of everything, he wanted to be. And after all, his wife was
everything--moon, vapour of trees, trickling water and drift of
perfume--it was all his wife. The moon glistened on her
finger-tips as he cherished them, and a flash came out of a
diamond, among the darkness. So, even here in the quiet harmony,
life was at a flash with itself.</p>

<p>"Come with me to the top of the red hill," he said to his wife
quietly.</p>

<p>"But why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Do come."</p>

<p>And dumbly she acquiesced, and her shawl hung gleaming above
the white flash of her skirt. He wanted to hold her hand, but she
was walking apart from him, in her long shawl. So he went to her
side, humbly. And he was humble, but he felt it was great. He had
looked into the whole of the night, as into the pupil of an eye.
And now, he would come perfectly clear out of all his
embarrassments of shame and darkness, clean as the moon who
walked naked across the night, so that the whole night was as an
effluence from her, the whole of it was hers, held in her
effluence of moonlight, which was her perfect nakedness, uniting
her to everything. Covering was barrier, like cloud across the
moon.</p>

<p>The red hill was steep, but there was a tiny path from the
bungalow, which he had worn himself. And in the effort of
climbing, he felt he was struggling nearer and nearer to himself.
Always he looked half round, where, just behind him, she
followed, in the lustrous obscurity of her shawl. Her steps came
with a little effort up the steep hill, and he loved her feet, he
wanted to kiss them as they strove upwards in the gloom. He put
aside the twigs and branches. There was a strong scent of
honeysuckle like a thick strand of gossamer over his mouth.</p>

<p>He knew a place on the ledge of the hill, on the lip of the
cliff, where the trees stood back and left a little
dancing-green, high up above the water, there in the midst of
miles of moonlit, lonely country. He parted the boughs, sure as a
fox that runs to its lair. And they stood together on this little
dancing-green presented towards the moon, with the red cliff
cumbered with bushes going down to the river below, and the haze
of moon-dust on the meadows, and the trees behind them, and only
the moon could look straight into the place he had chosen.</p>

<p>She stood always a little way behind him. He saw her face all
compounded of shadows and moonlight, and he dared not kiss her
yet.</p>

<p>"Will you," he said, "will you take off your things and love
me here?"</p>

<p>"I can't," she said.</p>

<p>He looked away to the moon. It was difficult to ask her again,
yet it meant so much to him. There was not a sound in the night.
He put his hand to his throat and began to unfasten his
collar.</p>

<p>"Take off all your things and love me," he pleaded.</p>

<p>For a moment she was silent.</p>

<p>"I can't," she said.</p>

<p>Mechanically, he had taken off his flannel collar and pushed
it into his pocket. Then he stood on the edge of the land,
looking down into all that gleam, as into the living pupil of an
eye. He was bareheaded to the moon. Not a breath of air ruffled
his bare throat. Still, in the dropping folds of her shawl, she
stood, a thing of dusk and moonlight, a little back. He ached
with the earnestness of his desire. All he wanted was to give
himself, clean and clear, into this night, this time. Of which
she was all, she was everything. He could go to her now, under
the white candour of the moon, without shame or shadow, but in
his completeness loving her completeness, without a stain,
without a shadow between them such as even a flower could cast.
For this he yearned as never in his life he could yearn more
deeply.</p>

<p>"Do take me," he said, gently parting the shawl on her breast.
But she held it close, and her voice went hard.</p>

<p>"No--I can't," she said.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I can't--let us go back."</p>

<p>He looked again over the countryside of dimness, saying in a
low tone, his back towards her:</p>

<p>"But I love you--and I want you so much--like that, here and
now. I'll never ask you anything again," he said quickly,
passionately, as he turned to her. "Do this for me," he said.
"I'll never trouble you for anything again. I promise."</p>

<p>"I can't," she said stubbornly, with some hopelessness in her
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Yes. You trust me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't want it. Not here--not now," she said.</p>

<p>"Do," he said. "Yes."</p>

<p>"You can have me in the bungalow. Why do you want me here?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"But I do. Have me, Edith. Have me now."</p>

<p>"No," she said, turning away. "I want to go down."</p>

<p>"And you won't?"</p>

<p>"No--I can't."</p>

<p>There was something like fear in her voice. They went down the
hill together. And he did not know how he hated her, as if she
had kept him out of the promised land that was justly his. He
thought he was too generous to bear her a grudge. So he had
always held himself deferential to her. And later that evening he
had loved her. But she had hated it, it had been really his hate
ravaging her. Why had he lied, calling it love? Ever since, it
had seemed the same, more or less. So that he had ceased to come
to her, gradually. For one night she had said: "I think a man's
body is ugly--all in parts with mechanical joints." And now he
had scarcely had her for some years. For she thought him an
ugliness. And there were no children.</p>

<p>Now that everything was essentially over for both of them,
they lived on the surface, and had good times. He drove to all
kinds of unexpected places in his motor-car, bathed where he
liked, said what he liked, and did what he liked. But nobody
minded very much his often aggressive unconventionality. It was
only fencing with the foils. There was no danger in his thrusts.
He was a castrated bear. So he prided himself on being a bear, on
being known as an uncouth bear.</p>

<p>It was not often he lay and let himself drift. But always when
he did, he held it against her that on the night when they
climbed the red bank, she refused to have him. There were perhaps
many things he might have held against her, but this was the only
one that remained: his real charge against her on the Judgment
Day. Why had she done it? It had been, he might almost say, a
holy desire on his part. It had been almost like taking off his
shoes before God. Yet she refused him, she who was his religion
to him. Perhaps she had been afraid, she who was so good--afraid
of the big righteousness of it--as if she could not trust herself
so near the Burning Bush, dared not go near for transfiguration,
afraid of herself.</p>

<p>It was a thought he could not bear. Rising softly, because she
was still talking, he went out into the night.</p>

<p>Elsa Laskell stirred uneasily in her chair. Mrs. Renshaw went
on talking like a somnambule, not because she really had anything
to say about the State-endowment of mothers, but because she had
a weight on her heart that she wanted to talk away. The girl
heard, and lifted her hand, and stirred her fingers uneasily in
the dark-purple porphyry bowl, where pink rose-leaves and
crimson, thrown this morning from the stem, lay gently
shrivelling. There came a slight acrid scent of new rose-petals.
And still the girl lifted her long white fingers among the red
and pink in the dark bowl, as if they stirred in blood.</p>

<p>And she felt the nights behind like a purple bowl into which
the woman's heart-beats were shed, like rose-leaves fallen and
left to wither and go brown. For Mrs. Renshaw had waited for him.
During happy days of stillness and blueness she had moved, while
the sunshine glancing through her blood made flowers in her
heart, like blossoms underground thrilling with expectancy,
lovely fragrant things that would have delight to appear. And all
day long she had gone secretly and quietly saying, saying:
"To-night--to-night they will blossom for him. To-night I shall
be a bed of blossom for him, all narcissi and fresh fragrant
things shaking for joy, when he comes with his deeper sunshine,
when he turns the darkness like mould, and brings them forth with
his sunshine for spade. Yea, there are two suns; him in the sky
and that other, warmer one whose beams are our radiant bodies. He
is a sun to me, shining full on my heart when he comes, and
everything stirs." But he had come like a bitter morning. He had
never bared the sun of himself to her--a sullen day he had been
on her heart, covered with cloud impenetrable. She had waited so
heavy anxious, with such a wealth of possibility. And he in his
blindness had never known. He could never let the real rays of
his love through the cloud of fear and mistrust. For once she had
denied him. And all her flowers had been shed inwards so that her
heart was like a heap of leaves, brown, withered, almost
scentless petals that had never given joy to anyone. And yet
again she had come to him pregnant with beauty and love, but he
had been afraid. When she lifted her eyes to him, he had looked
aside. The kisses she needed like warm raindrops he dared not
give, till she was parched and gone hard, and did not want them.
Then he gave kisses enough. But he never trusted himself. When
she was open and eager to him, he was afraid. When she was shut,
it was like playing at pride, to pull her petals apart, a game
that gave him pleasure.</p>

<p>So they had been mutually afraid of each other, but he most
often. Whenever she had needed him at some mystery of love, he
had overturned her censers and her sacraments, and made profane
love in her sacred place. Which was why, at last, she had hated
his body; but perhaps she had hated it at first, or feared it so
much that it was hate.</p>

<p>And he had said to her: "If <i>we</i> don't have children, you
might have them by another man--" which was surely one of the
cruellest things a woman ever heard from her husband. For so
little was she his, that he would give her a caller and not mind.
This was all the wife she was to him. He was a free and easy man,
and brought home to dinner any man who pleased him, from a beggar
upwards. And his wife was to be as public as his board.</p>

<p>Nay, to the very bowl of her heart, any man might put his lips
and he would not mind. And so, she sadly set down the bowl from
between her two hands of offering, and went always empty, and
aloof.</p>

<p>Yet they were married, they were good friends. It was said
they were the most friendly married couple in the county. And
this was it. And all the while, like a scent, the bitter psalm of
the woman filled the room.</p>

<p>"Like a garden in winter, I was full of bulbs and roots, I was
full of little flowers, all conceived inside me.</p>

<p>"And they were all shed away unborn, little abortions of
flowers.</p>

<p>"Every day I went like a bee gathering honey from the sky and
among the stars I rummaged for yellow honey, filling it in my
comb.</p>

<p>"Then I broke the comb, and put it to your lips. But you
turned your mouth aside and said: 'You have made my face unclean,
and smeared my mouth.'</p>

<p>"And week after week my body was a vineyard, my veins were
vines. And as the grapes, the purple drops grew full and sweet, I
crushed them in a bowl, I treasured the wine.</p>

<p>"Then when the bowl was full I came with joy to you. But you
in fear started away, and the bowl was thrown from my hands, and
broke in pieces at my feet.</p>

<p>"Many times, and many times, I said: 'The hour is striking,'
but he answered: 'Not yet.'</p>

<p>"Many times and many times he has heard the cock crow, and
gone out and wept, he knew not why.</p>

<p>"I was a garden and he ran in me as in the grass.</p>

<p>"I was a stream, and he threw his waste in me.</p>

<p>"I held the rainbow balanced on my outspread hands, and he
said: 'You open your hands and give me nothing.'</p>

<p>"What am I now but a bowl of withered leaves, but a
kaleidoscope of broken beauties, but an empty bee-hive, yea, a
rich garment rusted that no one has worn, a dumb singer, with the
voice of a nightingale yet making discord.</p>

<p>"And it was over with me, and my hour is gone. And soon like a
barren sea-shell on the strand, I shall be crushed underfoot to
dust.</p>

<p>"But meanwhile I sing to those that listen with their ear
against me, of the sea that gave me form and being, the
everlasting sea, and in my song is nothing but bitterness, for of
the fluid life of the sea I have no more, but I am to be dust,
that powdery stuff the sea knows not. I am to be dead, who was
born of life, silent who was made a mouth, formless who was all
of beauty. Yea, I was a seed that held the heavens lapped up in
bud, with a whirl of stars and a steady moon.</p>

<p>"And the seed is crushed that never sprouted, there is a
heaven lost, and stars and a moon that never came forth.</p>

<p>"I was a bud that never was discovered, and in my shut
chalice, skies and lake water and brooks lie crumbling, and stars
and the sun are smeared out, and birds are a little powdery dust,
and their singing is dry air, and I am a dark chalice."</p>

<p>And the girl, hearing the hostess talk, still talk, and yet
her voice like the sound of a sea-shell whispering hoarsely of
despair, rose and went out into the garden, timidly, beginning to
cry. For what should she do for herself?</p>

<p>Renshaw, leaning on the wicket that led to the paddock,
called:</p>

<p>"Come on, don't be alarmed--Pan is dead."</p>

<p>And then she bit back her tears. For when he said, "Pan is
dead," he meant Pan was dead in his own long, loose Dane's body.
Yet she was a nymph still, and if Pan were dead, she ought to
die. So with tears she went up to him.</p>

<p>"It's all right out here," he said. "By Jove, when you see a
night like this, how can you say that life's tragedy--or death
either, for that matter?"</p>

<p>"What is it then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, that's one too many--a joke, eh?"</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "one has no business to be
irreverent."</p>

<p>"Who?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You," she said, "and me, and all of us."</p>

<p>Then he leaned on the wicket, thinking till he laughed.</p>

<p>"Life's a real good thing," he said.</p>

<p>"But why protest it?" she answered.</p>

<p>And again he was silent.</p>

<p>"If the moon came nearer and nearer," she said, "and were a
naked woman, what would you do?"</p>

<p>"Fetch a wrap, probably," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes--you would do that," she answered.</p>

<p>"And if he were a man, ditto?" he teased.</p>

<p>"If a star came nearer and were a naked man, I should look at
him."</p>

<p>"That is surely very improper," he mocked, with still a tinge
of yearning.</p>

<p>"If he were a star come near--" she answered.</p>

<p>Again he was silent.</p>

<p>"You are a queer fish of a girl," he said.</p>

<p>They stood at the gate, facing the silver-grey paddock.
Presently their hostess came out, a long shawl hanging from her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"So you are here," she said. "Were you bored?"</p>

<p>"I was," he replied amiably. "But there, you know I always
am."</p>

<p>"And I forgot," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"What were you talking about?" asked Mrs. Renshaw, simply
curious. She was not afraid of her husband's running loose.</p>

<p>"We were just saying 'Pan is dead'," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather trite?" asked the hostess.</p>

<p>"Some of us miss him fearfully," said the girl.</p>

<p>"For what reason?" asked Mrs. Renshaw.</p>

<p>"Those of us who are nymphs--just lost nymphs among farm-lands
and suburbs. I wish Pan were alive."</p>

<p>"Did he die of old age?" mocked the hostess.</p>

<p>"Don't they say, when Christ was born, a voice was heard in
the air saying: 'Pan is dead.' I wish Christ needn't have killed
Pan."</p>

<p>"I wonder how He managed it," said Renshaw.</p>

<p>"By disapproving of him, I suppose," replied his wife. And her
retort cut herself, and gave her a sort of fakir pleasure.</p>

<p>"The men are all women now," she said, "since the fauns died
in a frost one night."</p>

<p>"A frost of disapproval," said the girl.</p>

<p>"A frost of fear," said Renshaw.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"Why was Christ afraid of Pan?" said the girl suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why was Pan so much afraid of Christ that he died?" asked
Mrs. Renshaw bitterly.</p>

<p>"And all his fauns in a frost one night," mocked Renshaw. Then
a light dawned on him. "Christ was woman and Pan was man," he
said. It gave him a real joy to say this bitterly, keenly--a
thrust into himself, and into his wife. "But the fauns and satyrs
are there--you have only to remove the surplices that all men
wear nowadays."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Mrs. Renshaw, "it is not true--the surplices have
grown into their limbs, like Hercules's garment."</p>

<p>"That his wife put on him," said Renshaw.</p>

<p>"Because she was afraid of him--not because she loved him,"
said the girl.</p>

<p>"She imagined that all her lonely wasted hours wove him a robe
of love," said Mrs. Renshaw. "It was to her horror she was
mistaken. You can't weave love out of waste."</p>

<p>"When I meet a man," said the girl, "I shall look down the
pupil of his eye, for a faun. And after a while it will come,
skipping--"</p>

<p>"Perhaps a satyr," said Mrs. Renshaw bitterly.</p>

<p>"No," said the girl, "because satyrs are old, and I have seen
some fearfully young men."</p>

<p>"Will is young even now--quite a boy," said his wife.</p>

<p>"Oh no!" cried the girl. "He says that neither life nor death
is a tragedy. Only somebody very old could say that."</p>

<p>There was a tension in the night. The man felt something give
way inside him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Edith," he said, with a quiet, bitter joy of cruelty, "I
am old."</p>

<p>The wife was frightened.</p>

<p>"You are always preposterous," she said quickly, crying inside
herself. She knew she herself had been never young.</p>

<p>"I shall look in the eyes of my man for the faun," the girl
continued in a sing-song, "and I shall find him. Then I shall
pretend to run away from him. And both our surplices, and all the
crucifix, will be outside the wood. Inside nymph and faun, Pan
and his satyrs--ah, yes: for Christ and the Cross is only for
day-time, and bargaining. Christ came to make us deal
honourably.</p>

<p>"But love is no deal, nor merchant's bargaining, and Christ
neither spoke of it nor forbade it. He was afraid of it. If once
His faun, the faun of the young Jesus had run free, seen one
white nymph's brief breast, He would not have been content to die
on a Cross--and then the men would have gone on cheating the
women in life's business, all the time. Christ made one bargain
in mankind's business--and He made it for the women's sake--I
suppose for His mother's, since He was fatherless. And Christ
made a bargain for me, and I shall avail myself of it. I won't be
cheated by my man. When between my still hands I weave silk out
of the air, like a cocoon, He shall not take it to pelt me with.
He shall draw it forth and weave it up. For I want to finger the
sunshine I have drawn through my body, stroke it, and have joy of
the fabric.</p>

<p>"And when I run wild on the hills, with Dionysus, and shall
come home like a bee that has rolled in floury crocuses, he must
see the wonder on me, and make bread of it.</p>

<p>"And when I say to him, 'It is harvest in my soul', he shall
look in my eyes and lower his nets where the shoal moves in a
throng in the dark, and lift out the living blue silver for me to
see, and know, and taste.</p>

<p>"All this, my faun in commerce, my faun at traffic with
me.</p>

<p>"And if he cheat me, he must take his chance.</p>

<p>"But I will not cheat him, in his hour, when he runs like a
faun after me. I shall flee, but only to be overtaken. I shall
flee, but never out of the wood to the crucifix. For that is to
deny I am a nymph; since how can a nymph cling at the crucifix?
Nay, the cross is the sign I have on my money, for honesty.</p>

<p>"In the morning, when we come out of the wood, I shall say to
him: 'Touch the cross, and prove you will deal fairly,' and if he
will not, I will set the dogs of anger and judgment on him, and
they shall chase him. But if, perchance, some night he contrive
to crawl back into the wood, beyond the crucifix, he will be faun
and I nymph, and I shall have no knowledge what happened outside,
in the realm of the crucifix. But in the morning, I shall say:
'Touch the cross, and prove you will deal fairly.' And being
renewed, he will touch the cross.</p>

<p>"Many a dead faun I have seen, like dead rabbits poisoned
lying about the paths, and many a dead nymph, like swans that
could not fly and the dogs destroyed.</p>

<p>"But I am a nymph and a woman, and Pan is for me, and Christ
is for me.</p>

<p>"For Christ I cover myself in my robe, and weep, and vow my
vow of honesty.</p>

<p>"For Pan I throw my coverings down and run headlong through
the leaves, because of the joy of running.</p>

<p>"And Pan will give me my children and joy, and Christ will
give me my pride.</p>

<p>"And Pan will give me my man, and Christ my husband.</p>

<p>"To Pan I am nymph, to Christ I am woman.</p>

<p>"And Pan is in the darkness, and Christ in the pale light.</p>

<p>"And night shall never be day, and day shall never be
night.</p>

<p>"But side by side they shall go, day and night, night and day,
for ever apart, for ever together.</p>

<p>"Pan and Christ, Christ and Pan.</p>

<p>"Both moving over me, so when in the sunshine I go in my robes
among my neighbours, I am a Christian. But when I run robeless
through the dark-scented woods alone, I am Pan's nymph.</p>

<p>"Now I must go, for I want to run away. Not run away from
myself, but to myself.</p>

<p>"For neither am I a lamp that stands in the way in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>"Now am I a sundial foolish at night.</p>

<p>"I am myself, running through light and shadow for ever, a
nymph and a Christian; I, not two things, but an apple with a
gold side and a red, a freckled deer, a stream that tinkles and a
pool where light is drowned; I, no fragment, no half-thing like
the day, but a blackbird with a white breast and underwings, a
peewit, a wild thing, beyond understanding."</p>

<p>"I wonder if we shall hear the nightingale to-night," said
Mrs. Renshaw.</p>

<p>"He's a gurgling fowl--I'd rather hear a linnet," said
Renshaw. "Come a drive with me to-morrow, Miss Laskell."</p>

<p>And the three went walking back to the house. And Elsa Laskell
was glad to get away from them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="s12">THE PRINCESS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>To her father, she was The Princess. To her Boston aunts and
uncles she was just <i>Dollie Urquhart, poor little
thing.</i></p>

<p>Colin Urquhart was just a bit mad. He was of an old Scottish
family, and he claimed royal blood. The blood of Scottish kings
flowed in his veins. On this point, his American relatives said,
he was just a bit "off". They could not bear any more to be told
<i>which</i> royal blood of Scotland blued his veins. The whole
thing was rather ridiculous, and a sore point. The only fact they
remembered was that it was not Stuart.</p>

<p>He was a handsome man, with a wide-open blue eye that seemed
sometimes to be looking at nothing, soft black hair brushed
rather low on his low, broad brow, and a very attractive body.
Add to this a most beautiful speaking voice, usually rather
hushed and diffident, but sometimes resonant and powerful like
bronze, and you have the sum of his charms. He looked like some
old Celtic hero. He looked as if he should have worn a greyish
kilt and a sporran, and shown his knees. His voice came direct
out of the hushed Ossianic past.</p>

<p>For the rest, he was one of those gentlemen of sufficient but
not excessive means who fifty years ago wandered vaguely about,
never arriving anywhere, never doing anything, and never
definitely being anything, yet well received in the good society
of more than one country.</p>

<p>He did not marry till he was nearly forty, and then it was a
wealthy Miss Prescott, from New England. Hannah Prescott at
twenty-two was fascinated by the man with the soft black hair not
yet touched by grey, and the wide, rather vague blue eyes. Many
women had been fascinated before her. But Colin Urquhart, by his
very vagueness, had avoided any decisive connection.</p>

<p>Mrs. Urquhart lived three years in the mist and glamour of her
husband's presence. And then it broke her. It was like living
with a fascinating spectre. About most things he was completely,
even ghostly oblivious. He was always charming, courteous,
perfectly gracious in that hushed, musical voice of his. But
absent. When all came to all, he just wasn't there. "Not all
there," as the vulgar say.</p>

<p>He was the father of the little girl she bore at the end of
the first year. But this did not substantiate him the more. His
very beauty and his haunting musical quality became dreadful to
her after the first few months. The strange echo: he was like a
living echo! His very flesh, when you touched it, did not seem
quite the flesh of a real man.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was that he was a little bit mad. She thought it
definitely the night her baby was born.</p>

<p>"Ah, so my little princess has come at last!" he said, in his
throaty, singing Celtic voice, like a glad chant, swaying
absorbed.</p>

<p>It was a tiny, frail baby, with wide, amazed blue eyes. They
christened it Mary Henrietta. She called the little thing <i>My
Dollie.</i> He called it always <i>My Princess.</i></p>

<p>It was useless to fly at him. He just opened his wide blue
eyes wider, and took a child-like, silent dignity there was no
getting past.</p>

<p>Hannah Prescott had never been robust. She had no great desire
to live. So when the baby was two years old she suddenly
died.</p>

<p>The Prescotts felt a deep but unadmitted resentment against
Colin Urquhart. They said he was selfish. Therefore they
discontinued Hannah's income, a month after her burial in
Florence, after they had urged the father to give the child over
to them, and he had courteously, musically, but quite finally
refused. He treated the Prescotts as if they were not of his
world, not realities to him: just casual phenomena, or
gramophones, talking-machines that had to be answered. He
answered them. But of their actual existence he was never once
aware.</p>

<p>They debated having him certified unsuitable to be guardian of
his own child. But that would have created a scandal. So they did
the simplest thing, after all--washed their hands of him. But
they wrote scrupulously to the child, and sent her modest
presents of money at Christmas, and on the anniversary of the
death of her mother.</p>

<p>To The Princess her Boston relatives were for many years just
a nominal reality. She lived with her father, and he travelled
continually, though in a modest way, living on his moderate
income. And never going to America. The child changed nurses all
the time. In Italy it was a contadina; in India she had an ayah;
in Germany she had a yellow-haired peasant girl.</p>

<p>Father and child were inseparable. He was not a recluse.
Wherever he went he was to be seen paying formal calls going out
to luncheon or to tea, rarely to dinner. And always with the
child. People called her Princess Urquhart, as if that were her
christened name.</p>

<p>She was a quick, dainty little thing with dark gold hair that
went a soft brown, and wide, slightly prominent blue eyes that
were at once so candid and so knowing. She was always grown up;
she never really grew up. Always strangely wise, and always
childish.</p>

<p>It was her father's fault.</p>

<p>"My little Princess must never take too much notice of people
and the things they say and do," he repeated to her. "People
don't know what they are doing and saying. They chatter-chatter,
and they hurt one another, and they hurt themselves very often,
till they cry. But don't take any notice, my little Princess.
Because it is all nothing. Inside everybody there is another
creature, a demon which doesn't care at all. You peel away all
the things they say and do and feel, as cook peels away the
outside of the onions. And in the middle of everybody there is a
green demon which you can't peel away. And this green demon never
changes, and it doesn't care at all about all the things that
happen to the outside leaves of the person, all the
chatter-chatter, and all the husbands and wives and children, and
troubles and fusses. You peel everything away from people, and
there is a green, upright demon in every man and woman; and this
demon is a man's real self, and a woman's real self. It doesn't
really care about anybody, it belongs to the demons and the
primitive fairies, who never care. But, even so, there are big
demons and mean demons, and splendid demonish fairies, and vulgar
ones. But there are no royal fairy women left. Only you, my
little Princess. You are the last of the royal race of the old
people; the last, my Princess. There are no others. You and I are
the last. When I am dead there will be only you. And that is why,
darling, you will never care for any of the people in the world
very much. Because their demons are all dwindled and vulgar. They
are not royal. Only you are royal, after me. Always remember
that. And always remember, it is a <i>great secret.</i> If you
tell people, they will try to kill you, because they will envy
you for being a Princess. It is our great secret, darling. I am a
prince, and you a princess, of the old, old blood. And we keep
our secret between us, all alone. And so, darling, you must treat
all people very politely, because <i>noblesse oblige.</i> But you
must never forget that you alone are the last of Princesses, and
that all other are less than you are, less noble, more vulgar.
Treat them politely and gently and kindly, darling. But you are
the Princess, and they are commoners. Never try to think of them
as if they were like you. They are not. You will find, always,
that they are lacking, lacking in the royal touch, which only you
have--"</p>

<p>The Princess learned her lesson early--the first lesson, of
absolute reticence, the impossibility of intimacy with any other
than her father; the second lesson, of na&iuml;ve, slightly
benevolent politeness. As a small child, something crystallised
in her character, making her clear and finished, and as
impervious as crystal.</p>

<p>"Dear child!" her hostesses said of her. "She is so quaint and
old-fashioned; such a lady, poor little mite!"</p>

<p>She was erect, and very dainty. Always small, nearly tiny in
physique, she seemed like a changeling beside her big, handsome,
slightly mad father. She dressed very simply, usually in blue or
delicate greys, with little collars of old Milan point, or very
finely-worked linen. She had exquisite little hands, that made
the piano sound like a spinet when she played. She was rather
given to wearing cloaks and capes, instead of coats, out of
doors, and little eighteenth-century sort of hats. Her complexion
was pure apple-blossom.</p>

<p>She looked as if she had stepped out of a picture. But no one,
to her dying day, ever knew exactly the strange picture her
father had framed her in and from which she never stepped.</p>

<p>Her grandfather and grandmother and her Aunt Maud demanded
twice to see her, once in Rome and once in Paris. Each time they
were charmed, piqued, and annoyed. She was so exquisite and such
a little virgin. At the same time so knowing and so oddly
assured. That odd, assured touch of condescension, and the inward
coldness, infuriated her American relations.</p>

<p>Only she really fascinated her grandfather. He was spellbound;
in a way, in love with the little faultless thing. His wife would
catch him brooding, musing over his grandchild, long months after
the meeting, and craving to see her again. He cherished to the
end the fond hope that she might come to live with him and her
grandmother.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much, grandfather. You are so very kind. But
Papa and I are such an old couple, you see, such a crochety old
couple, living in a world of our own."</p>

<p>Her father let her see the world--from the outside. And he let
her read. When she was in her teens she read Zola and Maupassant,
and with the eyes of Zola and Maupassant she looked on Paris. A
little later she read Tolstoi and Dostoevsky. The latter confused
her. The others, she seemed to understand with a very shrewd,
canny understanding, just as she understood the Decameron stories
as she read them in their old Italian, or the Nibelung poems.
Strange and <i>uncanny,</i> she seemed to understand things in a
cold light perfectly, with all the flush of fire absent. She was
something like a changeling, not quite human.</p>

<p>This earned her, also, strange antipathies. Cabmen and railway
porters, especially in Paris and Rome, would suddenly treat her
with brutal rudeness, when she was alone. They seemed to look on
her with sudden violent antipathy. They sensed in her curious
impertinence, an easy, sterile impertinence towards the things
<i>they</i> felt most. She was so assured, and her flower of
maidenhood was so scentless. She could look at a lusty, sensual
Roman cabman as if he were a sort of grotesque, to make her
smile. She knew all about him, in Zola. And the peculiar
condescension with which she would give him her order, as if she,
frail, beautiful thing, were the only reality, and he, coarse
monster, was a sort of Caliban floundering in the mud on the
margin of the pool of the perfect lotus, would suddenly enrage
the fellow, the real Mediterranean who prided himself on his
<i>beaut&eacute; male,</i> and to whom the phallic mystery was
still the only mystery. And he would turn a terrible face on her,
bully her in a brutal, coarse fashion--hideous. For to him she
had only the blasphemous impertinence of her own sterility.</p>

<p>Encounters like these made her tremble, and made her know she
must have support from the outside. The power of her spirit did
not extend to these low people, and they had all the physical
power. She realised an implacability of hatred in their turning
on her. But she did not lose her head. She quietly paid out money
and turned away.</p>

<p>Those were dangerous moments, though, and she learned to be
prepared for them. The Princess she was, and the fairy from the
North, and could never understand the volcanic phallic rage with
which coarse people could turn on her in a paroxysm of hatred.
They never turned on her father like that. And quite early she
decided it was the New England mother in her whom they hated.
Never for one minute could she see with the old Roman eyes, see
herself as sterility, the barren flower taking on airs and an
intolerable impertinence. This was what the Roman cabman saw in
her. And he longed to crush the barren blossom. Its sexless
beauty and its authority put him in a passion of brutal
revolt.</p>

<p>When she was nineteen her grandfather died, leaving her a
considerable fortune in the safe hands of responsible trustees.
They would deliver her her income, but only on condition that she
resided for six months in the year in the United States.</p>

<p>"Why should they make me conditions?" she said to her father.
"I refuse to be imprisoned six months in the year in the United
States. We will tell them to keep their money."</p>

<p>"Let us be wise, my little Princess, let us be wise. No, we
are almost poor, and we are never safe from rudeness. I cannot
allow anybody to be rude to me. I hate it, I hate it!" His eyes
flamed as he said it. "I could kill any man or woman who is rude
to me. But we are in exile in the world. We are powerless. If we
were really poor, we should be quite powerless, and then I should
die. No, my Princess. Let us take their money, then they will not
dare to be rude to us. Let us take it, as we put on clothes, to
cover ourselves from their aggressions."</p>

<p>There began a new phase, when the father and daughter spent
their summers on the Great Lakes or in California, or in the
South-West. The father was something of a poet, the daughter
something of a painter. He wrote poems about the lakes or the
redwood trees, and she made dainty drawings. He was physically a
strong man, and he loved the out-of-doors. He would go off with
her for days, paddling in a canoe and sleeping by a camp-fire.
Frail little Princess, she was always undaunted, always
undaunted. She would ride with him on horseback over the mountain
trails till she was so tired she was nothing but a bodiless
consciousness sitting astride her pony. But she never gave in.
And at night he folded her in her blanket on a bed of balsam pine
twigs, and she lay and looked at the stars unmurmuring. She was
fulfilling her r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>People said to her as the years passed, and she was a woman of
twenty-five, then a woman of thirty, and always the same virgin
dainty Princess, 'knowing' in a dispassionate way, like an old
woman, and utterly intact:</p>

<p>"Don't you ever think what you will do when your father is no
longer with you?"</p>

<p>She looked at her interlocutor with that cold, elfin
detachment of hers:</p>

<p>"No, I never think of it," she said.</p>

<p>She had a tiny, but exquisite little house in London, and
another small, perfect house in Connecticut, each with a faithful
housekeeper. Two homes, if she chose. And she knew many
interesting literary and artistic people. What more?</p>

<p>So the years passed imperceptibly. And she had that quality of
the sexless fairies, she did not change. At thirty-three she
looked twenty-three.</p>

<p>Her father, however, was ageing, and becoming more and more
queer. It was now her task to be his guardian in his private
madness. He spent the last three years of life in the house in
Connecticut. He was very much estranged, sometimes had fits of
violence which almost killed the little Princess. Physical
violence was horrible to her; it seemed to shatter her heart. But
she found a woman a few years younger than herself, well-educated
and sensitive, to be a sort of nurse-companion to the mad old
man. So the fact of madness was never openly admitted. Miss
Cummins, the companion, had a passionate loyalty to the Princess,
and a curious affection, tinged with love, for the handsome,
white-haired, courteous old man, who was never at all aware of
his fits of violence once they had passed.</p>

<p>The Princess was thirty-eight years old when her father died.
And quite unchanged. She was still tiny, and like a dignified,
scentless flower. Her soft brownish hair, almost the colour of
beaver fur, was bobbed, and fluffed softly round her
apple-blossom face, that was modelled with an arched nose like a
proud old Florentine portrait. In her voice, manner and bearing
she was exceedingly still, like a flower that has blossomed in a
shadowy place. And from her blue eyes looked out the Princess's
eternal laconic challenge, that grew almost sardonic as the years
passed. She was the Princess, and sardonically she looked out on
a princeless world.</p>

<p>She was relieved when her father died, and at the same time,
it was as if everything had evaporated around her. She had lived
in a sort of hot-house, in the aura of her father's madness.
Suddenly the hot-house had been removed from around her, and she
was in the raw, vast, vulgar open air.</p>

<p><i>Quoi faire?</i> What was she to do? She seemed faced with
absolute nothingness. Only she had Miss Cummins, who shared with
her the secret, and almost the passion for her father. In fact,
the Princess felt that her passion for her mad father had in some
curious way transferred itself largely to Charlotte Cummins
during the last years. And now Miss Cummins was the vessel that
held the passion for the dead man. She herself, the Princess, was
an empty vessel.</p>

<p>An empty vessel in the enormous warehouse of the world.</p>

<p><i>Quoi faire?</i> What was she to do? She felt that, since
she could not evaporate into nothingness, like alcohol from an
unstoppered bottle, she must <i>do</i> something. Never before in
her life had she felt the incumbency. Never, never had she felt
she must <i>do</i> anything. That was left to the vulgar.</p>

<p>Now her father was dead, she found herself on the
<i>fringe</i> of the vulgar crowd, sharing their necessity to
<i>do</i> something. It was a little humiliating. She felt
herself becoming vulgarised. At the same time she found herself
looking at men with a shrewder eye: an eye to marriage. Not that
she felt any sudden interest in men, or attraction towards them.
No. She was still neither interested nor attracted towards men
vitally. But <i>marriage</i>, that peculiar abstraction, had
imposed a sort of spell on her. She thought that <i>marriage</i>,
in the blank abstract, was the thing she ought to <i>do.</i> That
<i>marriage</i> implied a man she also knew. She knew all the
facts. But the man seemed a property of her own mind rather than
a thing in himself, another thing.</p>

<p>Her father died in the summer, the month after her
thirty-eighth birthday. When all was over, the obvious thing to
do, of course, was to travel. With Miss Cummins. The two women
knew each other intimately, but they were always Miss Urquhart
and Miss Cummins to one another, and a certain distance was
instinctively maintained. Miss Cummins, from Philadelphia, of
scholastic stock, and intelligent but untravelled, four years
younger than the Princess, felt herself immensely the junior of
her 'lady'. She had a sort of passionate veneration for the
Princess, who seemed to her ageless, timeless. She could not see
the rows of tiny, dainty, exquisite shoes in the Princess's
cupboard without feeling a stab at the heart, a stab of
tenderness and reverence, almost of awe.</p>

<p>Miss Cummins also was virginal, but with a look of puzzled
surprise in her brown eyes. Her skin was pale and clear, her
features well modelled, but there was a certain blankness in her
expression, where the Princess had an odd touch of Renaissance
grandeur. Miss Cummins's voice was also hushed almost to a
whisper; it was the inevitable effect of Colin Urquhart's room.
But the hushedness had a hoarse quality.</p>

<p>The Princess did not want to go to Europe. Her face seemed
turned west. Now her father was gone, she felt she would go west,
westwards, as if for ever. Following, no doubt, the March of
Empire, which is brought up rather short on the Pacific coast,
among swarms of wallowing bathers.</p>

<p>No, not the Pacific coast. She would stop short of that. The
South-West was less vulgar. She would go to New Mexico.</p>

<p>She and Miss Cummins arrived at the Rancho del Cerro Gordo
towards the end of August, when the crowd was beginning to drift
back east. The ranch lay by a stream on the desert some four
miles from the foot of the mountains, a mile away from the Indian
pueblo of San Cristobal. It was a ranch for the rich; the
Princess paid thirty dollars a day for herself and Miss Cummins.
But then she had a little cottage to herself, among the apple
trees of the orchard, with an excellent cook. She and Miss
Cummins, however, took dinner at evening in the large
guest-house. For the Princess still entertained the idea of
<i>marriage.</i></p>

<p>The guests at the Rancho del Cerro Gordo were of all sorts,
except the poor sort. They were practically all rich, and many
were romantic. Some were charming, others were vulgar, some were
movie people, quite quaint and not unattractive in their
vulgarity, and many were Jews. The Princess did not care for
Jews, though they were usually the most interesting to
<i>talk</i> to. So she talked a good deal with the Jews, and
painted with the artists, and rode with the young men from
college, and had altogether quite a good time. And yet she felt
something of a fish out of water, or a bird in the wrong forest.
And <i>marriage</i> remained still completely in the abstract. No
connecting it with any of these young men, even the nice
ones.</p>

<p>The Princess looked just twenty-five. The freshness of her
mouth, the hushed, delicate-complexioned virginity of her face
gave her not a day more. Only a certain laconic look in her eyes
was disconcerting. When she was <i>forced</i> to write her age,
she put twenty-eight, making the figure <i>two</i> rather badly,
so that it just avoided being a three.</p>

<p>Men hinted marriage at her. Especially boys from college
suggested it from a distance. But they all failed before the look
of sardonic ridicule in the Princess's eyes. It always seemed to
her rather preposterous, quite ridiculous, and a tiny bit
impertinent on their part.</p>

<p>The only man that intrigued her at all was one of the guides,
a man called Romero--Domingo Romero. It was he who had sold the
ranch itself to the Wilkiesons, ten years before, for two
thousand dollars. He had gone away, then reappeared at the old
place. For he was the son of the old Romero, the last of the
Spanish family that had owned miles of land around San Cristobal.
But the coming of the white man and the failure of the vast
flocks of sheep, and the fatal inertia which overcomes all men,
at last, on the desert near the mountains, had finished the
Romero family. The last descendants were just Mexican
peasants.</p>

<p>Domingo, the heir, had spent his two thousand dollars, and was
working for white people. He was now about thirty years old, a
tall, silent fellow, with a heavy closed mouth and black eyes
that looked across at one almost sullenly. From behind he was
handsome, with a strong, natural body, and the back of his neck
very dark and well-shapen, strong with life. But his dark face
was long and heavy, almost sinister, with that peculiar heavy
meaninglessness in it, characteristic of the Mexicans of his own
locality. They are strong, they seem healthy. They laugh and joke
with one another. But their physique and their natures seem
static, as if there were nowhere, nowhere at all for their
energies to go, and their faces, degenerating to misshapen
heaviness, seem to have no <i>raison</i> <i>d'&ecirc;tre,</i> no
radical meaning. Waiting either to die or to be aroused into
passion and hope. In some of the black eyes a queer, haunting
mystic quality, sombre and a bit gruesome, the
skull-and-cross-bones look of the Penitentes. They had found
their <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> in self-torture and
death-worship. Unable to wrest a <i>positive</i> significance for
themselves from the vast, beautiful, but vindictive landscape
they were born into, they turned on their own selves, and
worshipped death through self-torture. The mystic gloom of this
showed in their eyes.</p>

<p>But as a rule the dark eyes of the Mexicans were heavy and
half alive, sometimes hostile, sometimes kindly, often with the
fatal Indian glaze on them, or the fatal Indian glint.</p>

<p>Domingo Romero was <i>almost</i> a typical Mexican to look at,
with the typical heavy, dark, long face, clean-shaven, with an
almost brutally heavy mouth. His eyes were black and
Indian-looking. Only, at the centre of their hopelessness was a
spark of pride, or self-confidence, or dauntlessness. Just a
spark in the midst of the blackness of static despair.</p>

<p>But this spark was the difference between him and the mass of
men. It gave a certain alert sensitiveness to his bearing and a
certain beauty to his appearance. He wore a low-crowned black
hat, instead of the ponderous headgear of the usual Mexican, and
his clothes were thinnish and graceful. Silent, aloof, almost
imperceptible in the landscape, he was an admirable guide, with a
startling quick intelligence that anticipated difficulties about
to rise. He could cook, too, crouching over the camp-fire and
moving his lean deft brown hands. The only fault he had was that
he was not forthcoming, he wasn't chatty and cosy.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't send Romero with us," the Jews would say. "One
can't get any response from him."</p>

<p>Tourists come and go, but they rarely <i>see</i> anything,
inwardly. None of them ever saw the spark at the middle of
Romero's eye; they were not alive enough to see it.</p>

<p>The Princess caught it one day, when she had him for a guide.
She was fishing for trout in the canyon, Miss Cummins was reading
a book, the horses were tied under the trees, Romero was fixing a
proper fly on her line. He fixed the fly and handed her the line,
looking up at her. And at that moment she caught the spark in his
eye. And instantly she knew that he was a gentleman, that his
'demon', as her father would have said, was a fine demon. And
instantly her manner towards him changed.</p>

<p>He had perched her on a rock over a quiet pool, beyond the
cotton-wood trees. It was early September, and the canyon already
cool, but the leaves of the cottonwoods were still green. The
Princess stood on her rock, a small but perfectly-formed figure,
wearing a soft, close grey sweater and neatly-cut grey
riding-breeches, with tall black boots, her fluffy brown hair
straggling from under a little grey felt hat. A woman? Not quite.
A changeling of some sort, perched in outline there on the rock,
in the bristling wild canyon. She knew perfectly well how to
handle a line. Her father had made a fisherman of her.</p>

<p>Romero, in a black shirt and with loose black trousers pushed
into wide black riding-boots, was fishing a little farther down.
He had put his hat on a rock behind him; his dark head was bent a
little forward, watching the water. He had caught three trout.
From time to time he glanced up-stream at the Princess, perched
there so daintily. He saw she had caught nothing.</p>

<p>Soon he quietly drew in his line and came up to her. His keen
eye watched her line, watched her position. Then, quietly, he
suggested certain changes to her, putting his sensitive brown
hand before her. And he withdrew a little, and stood in silence,
leaning against a tree, watching her. He was helping her across
the distance. She knew it, and thrilled. And in a moment she had
a bite. In two minutes she landed a good trout. She looked round
at him quickly, her eyes sparkling, the colour heightened in her
cheeks. And as she met his eyes a smile of greeting went over his
dark face, very sudden, with an odd sweetness.</p>

<p>She knew he was helping her. And she felt in his presence a
subtle, insidious male <i>kindliness</i> she had never known
before waiting upon her. Her cheek flushed, and her blue eyes
darkened.</p>

<p>After this, she always looked for him, and for that curious
dark beam of a man's kindliness which he could give her, as it
were, from his chest, from his heart. It was something she had
never known before.</p>

<p>A vague, unspoken intimacy grew up between them. She liked his
voice, his appearance, his presence. His natural language was
Spanish; he spoke English like a foreign language, rather slow,
with a slight hesitation, but with a sad, plangent sonority
lingering over from his Spanish. There was a certain subtle
correctness in his appearance; he was always perfectly shaved;
his hair was thick and rather long on top, but always carefully
groomed behind. And his fine black cashmere shirt, his wide
leather belt, his well-cut, wide black trousers going into the
embroidered cowboy boots had a certain inextinguishable elegance.
He wore no silver rings or buckles. Only his boots were
embroidered and decorated at the top with an inlay of white
<i>su&egrave;de.</i> He seemed elegant, slender, yet he was very
strong.</p>

<p>And at the same time, curiously, he gave her the feeling that
death was not far from him. Perhaps he too was half in love with
death. However that may be, the sense she had that death was not
far from him made him 'possible' to her.</p>

<p>Small as she was, she was quite a good horsewoman. They gave
her at the ranch a sorrel mare, very lovely in colour, and
well-made, with a powerful broad neck and the hollow back that
betokens a swift runner. Tansy, she was called. Her only fault
was the usual mare's failing, she was inclined to be
hysterical.</p>

<p>So that every day the Princess set off with Miss Cummins and
Romero, on horseback, riding into the mountains. Once they went
camping for several days, with two more friends in the party.</p>

<p>"I think I like it better," the Princess said to Romero, "when
we three go alone."</p>

<p>And he gave her one of his quick, transfiguring smiles.</p>

<p>It was curious no white man had ever showed her this capacity
for subtle gentleness, this power to <i>help</i> her in silence
across a distance, if she were fishing without success, or tired
of her horse, or if Tansy suddenly got scared. It was as if
Romero could send her <i>from his heart</i> a dark beam of
succour and sustaining. She had never known this before, and it
was very thrilling.</p>

<p>Then the smile that suddenly creased his dark face, showing
the strong white teeth. It creased his face almost into a savage
grotesque. And at the same time there was in it something so
warm, such a dark flame of kindliness for her, she was elated
into her true Princess self.</p>

<p>Then that vivid, latent spark in his eye, which she had seen,
and which she knew he was aware she had seen. It made an
inter-recognition between them, silent and delicate. Here he was
delicate as a woman in this subtle inter-recognition.</p>

<p>And yet his presence only put to flight in her the
<i>id&eacute;e fixe</i> of 'marriage'. For some reason, in her
strange little brain, the idea of <i>marrying</i> him could not
enter. Not for any definite reason. He was in himself a
gentleman, and she had plenty of money for two. There was no
actual obstacle. Nor was she conventional.</p>

<p>No, now she came down to it, it was as if their two
'd&aelig;mons' could marry, were perhaps married. Only their two
<i>selves</i>, Miss Urquhart and Se&ntilde;or Domingo Romero,
were for some reason incompatible. There was a peculiar subtle
intimacy of inter-recognition between them. But she did not see
in the least how it would lead to marriage. Almost she could more
easily marry one of the nice boys from Harvard or Yale.</p>

<p>The time passed, and she let it pass. The end of September
came, with aspens going yellow on the mountain heights, and
oak-scrub going red. But as yet the cottonwoods in the valley and
canyons had not changed.</p>

<p>"When will you go away?" Romero asked her, looking at her
fixedly, with a blank black eye.</p>

<p>"By the end of October," she said. "I have promised to be in
Santa Barbara at the beginning of November."</p>

<p>He was hiding the spark in his eye from her. But she saw the
peculiar sullen thickening of his heavy mouth.</p>

<p>She had complained to him many times that one never saw any
wild animals, except chipmunks and squirrels, and perhaps a skunk
and a porcupine. Never a deer, or a bear, or a mountain lion.</p>

<p>"Are there no bigger animals in these mountains?" she asked,
dissatisfied.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "There are deer--I see their tracks. And I saw
the tracks of a bear."</p>

<p>"But why can one never see the animals themselves?" She looked
dissatisfied and wistful like a child.</p>

<p>"Why, it's pretty hard for you to see them. They won't let you
come close. You have to keep still, in a place where they come.
Or else you have to follow their tracks a long way."</p>

<p>"I can't bear to go away till I've seen them: a bear, or a
deer--"</p>

<p>The smile came suddenly on his face, indulgent.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want? Do you want to go up into the
mountains to some place, to wait till they come?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, looking up at him with a sudden na&iuml;ve
impulse of recklessness.</p>

<p>And immediately his face became sombre again, responsible.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with slight irony, a touch of mockery of her.
"You will have to find a house. It's very cold at night now. You
would have to stay all night in a house."</p>

<p>"And there are no houses up there?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "There is a little shack that belongs to
me, that a miner built a long time ago, looking for gold. You can
go there and stay one night, and maybe you see something. Maybe!
I don't know. Maybe nothing come."</p>

<p>"How much chance is there?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. Last time when I was there I see three
deer come down to drink at the water, and I shot two raccoons.
But maybe this time we don't see anything."</p>

<p>"Is there water there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a little round pond, you know, below the spruce
trees. And the water from the snow runs into it."</p>

<p>"Is it far away?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, pretty far. You see that ridge there"--and turning to
the mountains he lifted his arm in the gesture which is somehow
so moving, out in the West, pointing to the distance--"that ridge
where there are no trees, only rock"--his black eyes were
focussed on the distance, his face impassive, but as if in
pain--"you go round that ridge, and along, then you come down
through the spruce trees to where that cabin is. My father bought
that placer claim from a miner who was broke, but nobody ever
found any gold or anything, and nobody ever goes there. Too
lonesome!"</p>

<p>The Princess watched the massive, heavy-sitting, beautiful
bulk of the Rocky Mountains. It was early in October, and the
aspens were already losing their gold leaves; high up, the spruce
and pine seemed to be growing darker; the great flat patches of
oak scrub on the heights were red like gore.</p>

<p>"Can I go over there?" she asked, turning to him and meeting
the spark in his eye.</p>

<p>His face was heavy with responsibility.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "you can go. But there'll be snow over the
ridge, and it's awful cold, and awful lonesome."</p>

<p>"I should like to go," she said, persistent.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "You can go if you want to."</p>

<p>She doubted, though, if the Wilkiesons would let her go; at
least alone with Romero and Miss Cummins.</p>

<p>Yet an obstinacy characteristic of her nature, an obstinacy
tinged perhaps with madness, had taken hold of her. She wanted to
look over the mountains into their secret heart. She wanted to
descend to the cabin below the spruce trees, near the tarn of
bright green water. She wanted to see the wild animals move about
in their wild unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"Let us say to the Wilkiesons that we want to make the trip
round the Frijoles canyon," she said.</p>

<p>The trip round the Frijoles canyon was a usual thing. It would
not be strenuous, nor cold, nor lonely: they could sleep in the
log house that was called an hotel.</p>

<p>Romero looked at her quickly.</p>

<p>"If you want to say that," he replied, "you can tell Mrs.
Wilkieson. Only I know she'll be mad with me if I take you up in
the mountains to that place. And I've got to go there first with
a pack-horse, to take lots of blankets and some bread. Maybe Miss
Cummins can't stand it. Maybe not. It's a hard trip."</p>

<p>He was speaking, and thinking, in the heavy, disconnected
Mexican fashion.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" The Princess was suddenly very decisive and
stiff with authority. "I want to do it. I will arrange with Mrs.
Wilkieson. And we'll go on Saturday."</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"I've got to go up on Sunday with a pack-horse and blankets,"
he said. "Can't do it before."</p>

<p>"Very well!" she said, rather piqued. "Then we'll start on
Monday."</p>

<p>She hated being thwarted even the tiniest bit.</p>

<p>He knew that if he started with the pack on Sunday at dawn he
would not be back until late at night. But he consented that they
should start on Monday morning at seven. The obedient Miss
Cummins was told to prepare for the Frijoles trip. On Sunday
Romero had his day off. He had not put in an appearance when the
Princess retired on Sunday night, but on Monday morning, as she
was dressing, she saw him bringing in the three horses from the
corral. She was in high spirits.</p>

<p>The night had been cold. There was ice at the edges of the
irrigation ditch, and the chipmunks crawled into the sun and lay
with wide, dumb, anxious eyes, almost too numb to run.</p>

<p>"We may be away two or three days," said the Princess.</p>

<p>"Very well. We won't begin to be anxious about you before
Thursday, then," said Mrs. Wilkieson, who was young and capable:
from Chicago. "Anyway," she added, "Romero will see you through.
He's so trustworthy."</p>

<p>The sun was already on the desert as they set off towards the
mountains, making the greasewood and the sage pale as pale-grey
sands, luminous the great level around them. To the right glinted
the shadows of the adobe pueblo, flat and almost invisible on the
plain, earth of its earth. Behind lay the ranch and the tufts of
tall, plumy cottonwoods, whose summits were yellowing under the
perfect blue sky.</p>

<p>Autumn breaking into colour in the great spaces of the
South-West.</p>

<p>But the three trotted gently along the trail, towards the sun
that sparkled yellow just above the dark bulk of the ponderous
mountains. Side-slopes were already gleaming yellow, flaming with
a second light, under coldish blue of the pale sky. The front
slopes were in shadow, with submerged lustre of red oak scrub and
dull-gold aspens, blue-black pines and grey-blue rock. While the
canyon was full of a deep blueness.</p>

<p>They rode single file, Romero first, on a black horse. Himself
in black, made a flickering black spot in the delicate pallor of
the great landscape, where even pine trees at a distance take a
film of blue paler than their green. Romero rode on in silence
past the tufts of furry greasewood. The Princess came next, on
her sorrel mare. And Miss Cummins, who was not quite happy on
horseback, came last, in the pale dust that the others kicked up.
Sometimes her horse sneezed, and she started.</p>

<p>But on they went at a gentle trot. Romero never looked round.
He could hear the sound of the hoofs following, and that was all
he wanted.</p>

<p>For the rest, he held ahead. And the Princess, with that
black, unheeding figure always travelling away from her, felt
strangely helpless, withal elated.</p>

<p>They neared the pale, round foot-hills, dotted with the round
dark pi&ntilde;on and cedar shrubs. The horses clinked and
trotted among the stones. Occasionally a big round greasewood
held out fleecy tufts of flowers, pure gold. They wound into blue
shadow, then up a steep stony slope, with the world lying pallid
away behind and below. Then they dropped into the shadow of the
San Cristobal canyon.</p>

<p>The stream was running full and swift. Occasionally the horses
snatched at a tuft of grass. The trail narrowed and became rocky;
the rocks closed in; it was dark and cool as the horses climbed
and climbed upwards, and the tree trunks crowded in the shadowy,
silent tightness of the canyon. They were among cottonwood trees
that ran straight up and smooth and round to an extraordinary
height. Above, the tips were gold, and it was sun. But away
below, where the horses struggled up the rocks and wound among
the trunks, there was still blue shadow by the sound of waters
and an occasional grey festoon of old man's beard, and here and
there a pale, dripping crane's-bill flower among the tangle and
the d&eacute;bris of the virgin place. And again the chill
entered the Princess's heart as she realised what a tangle of
decay and despair lay in the virgin forests.</p>

<p>They scrambled downwards, splashed across stream, up rocks and
along the trail of the other side. Romero's black horse stopped,
looked down quizzically at the fallen trees, then stepped over
lightly. The Princess's sorrel followed, carefully. But Miss
Cummins's buckskin made a fuss, and had to be got round.</p>

<p>In the same silence, save for the clinking of the horses and
the splashing as the trail crossed stream, they worked their way
upwards in the tight, tangled shadow of the canyon. Sometimes,
crossing stream, the Princess would glance upwards, and then
always her heart caught in her breast. For high up, away in
heaven, the mountain heights shone yellow, dappled with dark
spruce firs, clear almost as speckled daffodils against the pale
turquoise blue lying high and serene above the dark-blue shadow
where the Princess was. And she would snatch at the blood-red
leaves of the oak as her horse crossed a more open slope, not
knowing what she felt.</p>

<p>They were getting fairly high, occasionally lifted above the
canyon itself, in the low groove below the speckled,
gold-sparkling heights which towered beyond. Then again they
dipped and crossed stream, the horses stepping gingerly across a
tangle of fallen, frail aspen stems, then suddenly floundering in
a mass of rocks. The black emerged ahead, his black tail waving.
The Princess let her mare find her own footing; then she too
emerged from the clatter. She rode on after the black. Then came
a great frantic rattle of the buckskin behind. The Princess was
aware of Romero's dark face looking round, with a strange,
demon-like watchfulness, before she herself looked round, to see
the buckskin scrambling rather lamely beyond the rocks, with one
of his pale buff knees already red with blood.</p>

<p>"He almost went down!" called Miss Cummins.</p>

<p>But Romero was already out of the saddle and hastening down
the path. He made quiet little noises to the buckskin, and began
examining the cut knee.</p>

<p>"Is he hurt?" cried Miss Cummins anxiously, and she climbed
hastily down.</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" she cried, as she saw the blood running
down the slender buff leg of the horse in a thin trickle. "Isn't
that <i>awful</i>?" She spoke in a stricken voice, and her face
was white.</p>

<p>Romero was still carefully feeling the knee of the buckskin.
Then he made him walk a few paces. And at last he stood up
straight and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not very bad!" he said. "Nothing broken."</p>

<p>Again he bent and worked at the knees. Then he looked up at
the Princess.</p>

<p>"He can go on," he said. "It's not bad."</p>

<p>The Princess looked down at the dark face in silence.</p>

<p>"What, go on right up here?" cried Miss Cummins. "How many
hours?"</p>

<p>"About five!" said Romero simply.</p>

<p>"Five hours!" cried Miss Cummins. "A horse with a lame knee!
And a steep mountain! Why-y!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's pretty steep up there," said Romero, pushing back
his hat and staring fixedly at the bleeding knee. The buckskin
stood in a stricken sort of dejection. "But I think he'll make it
all right," the man added.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Miss Cummins, her eyes bright with sudden passion
of unshed tears. "I wouldn't think of it. I wouldn't ride him up
there, not for any money."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't you?" asked Romero.</p>

<p>"It <i>hurts</i> him."</p>

<p>Romero bent down again to the horse's knee.</p>

<p>"Maybe it hurts him a little," he said. "But he can make it
all right, and his leg won't get stiff."</p>

<p>"What! Ride him five hours up the steep mountains?" cried Miss
Cummins. "I couldn't. I just couldn't do it. I'll lead him a
little way and see if he can go. But I <i>couldn't</i> ride him
again. I couldn't. Let me walk."</p>

<p>"But Miss Cummins, dear, if Romero says he'll be all right?"
said the Princess.</p>

<p>"I know it hurts him. Oh, I just couldn't bear it."</p>

<p>There was no doing anything with Miss Cummins. The thought of
a hurt animal always put her into a sort of hysterics.</p>

<p>They walked forward a little, leading the buckskin. He limped
rather badly. Miss Cummins sat on a rock.</p>

<p>"Why, it's agony to see him!" she cried. "It's
<i>cruel</i>!"</p>

<p>"He won't limp after a bit, if you take no notice of him,"
said Romero. "Now he plays up, and limps very much, because he
wants to make you see."</p>

<p>"I don't think there can be much playing up," said Miss
Cummins bitterly. "We can see how it must hurt him."</p>

<p>"It don't hurt much," said Romero.</p>

<p>But now Miss Cummins was silent with antipathy.</p>

<p>It was a deadlock. The party remained motionless on the trail,
the Princess in the saddle, Miss Cummins seated on a rock, Romero
standing black and remote near the drooping buckskin.</p>

<p>"Well!" said the man suddenly at last. "I guess we go back,
then."</p>

<p>And he looked up swiftly at his horse, which was cropping at
the mountain herbage and treading on the trailing reins.</p>

<p>"No!" cried the Princess. "Oh no!" Her voice rang with a great
wail of disappointment and anger. Then she checked herself.</p>

<p>Miss Cummins rose with energy.</p>

<p>"Let me lead the buckskin home," she said, with cold dignity,
"and you two go on."</p>

<p>This was received in silence. The Princess was looking down at
her with a sardonic, almost cruel gaze.</p>

<p>"We've only come about two hours," said Miss Cummins. "I don't
mind a bit leading him home. But I <i>couldn't</i> ride him. I
<i>couldn't</i> have him ridden with that knee."</p>

<p>This again was received in dead silence. Romero remained
impassive, almost inert.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the Princess. "You lead him home.
You'll be quite all right. Nothing can happen to you, possibly.
And say to them that we have gone on and shall be home
tomorrow--or the day after."</p>

<p>She spoke coldly and distinctly. For she could not bear to be
thwarted.</p>

<p>"Better all go back, and come again another day," said
Romero--non-committal.</p>

<p>"There will never <i>be</i> another day," cried the Princess.
"I want to go on."</p>

<p>She looked at him square in the eyes, and met the spark in his
eye.</p>

<p>He raised his shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>"If you want it," he said. "I'll go on with you. But Miss
Cummins can ride my horse to the end of the canyon, and I lead
the buckskin. Then I come back to you."</p>

<p>It was arranged so. Miss Cummins had her saddle put on
Romero's black horse, Romero took the buckskin's bridle, and they
started back. The Princess rode very slowly on, upwards, alone.
She was at first so angry with Miss Cummins that she was blind to
everything else. She just let her mare follow her own
inclinations.</p>

<p>The peculiar spell of anger carried the Princess on, almost
unconscious, for an hour or so. And by this time she was
beginning to climb pretty high. Her horse walked steadily all the
time. They emerged on a bare slope, and the trail wound through
frail aspen stems. Here a wind swept, and some of the aspens were
already bare. Others were fluttering their discs of pure, solid
yellow leaves, so <i>nearly</i> like petals, while the slope
ahead was one soft, glowing fleece of daffodil yellow; fleecy
like a golden foxskin, and yellow as daffodils alive in the wind
and the high mountain sun.</p>

<p>She paused and looked back. The near great slopes were mottled
with gold and the dark hue of spruce, like some unsinged eagle,
and the light lay gleaming upon them. Away through the gap of the
canyon she could see the pale blue of the egg-like desert, with
the crumpled dark crack of the Rio Grande Canyon. And far, far
off, the blue mountains like a fence of angels on the
horizon.</p>

<p>And she thought of her adventure. She was going on alone with
Romero. But then she was very sure of herself, and Romero was not
the kind of man to do anything to her against her will. This was
her first thought. And she just had a fixed desire to go over the
brim of the mountains, to look into the inner chaos of the
Rockies. And she wanted to go with Romero, because he had some
peculiar kinship with her; there was some peculiar link between
the two of them. Miss Cummins anyhow would have been only a
discordant note.</p>

<p>She rode on, and emerged at length in the lap of the summit.
Beyond her was a great concave of stone and stark, dead-grey
trees, where the mountain ended against the sky. But nearer was
the dense black, bristling spruce, and at her feet was the lap of
the summit, a flat little valley of sere grass and quiet-standing
yellow aspens, the stream trickling like a thread across.</p>

<p>It was a little valley or shell from which the stream was
gently poured into the lower rocks and trees of the canyon.
Around her was a fairy-like gentleness, the delicate sere grass,
the groves of delicate-stemmed aspens dropping their flakes of
bright yellow. And the delicate, quick little stream threading
through the wild, sere grass.</p>

<p>Here one might expect deer and fawns and wild things, as in a
little paradise. Here she was to wait for Romero, and they were
to have lunch.</p>

<p>She unfastened her saddle and pulled it to the ground with a
crash, letting her horse wander with a long rope. How beautiful
Tansy looked, sorrel, among the yellow leaves that lay like a
patina on the sere ground. The Princess herself wore a fleecy
sweater of a pale, sere buff, like the grass, and riding-breeches
of a pure orange-tawny colour. She felt quite in the picture.</p>

<p>From her saddle-pouches she took the packages of lunch, spread
a little cloth, and sat to wait for Romero. Then she made a
little fire. Then she ate a devilled egg. Then she ran after
Tansy, who was straying across-stream. Then she sat in the sun,
in the stillness near the aspens, and waited.</p>

<p>The sky was blue. Her little alp was soft and delicate as
fairy-land. But beyond and up jutted the great slopes, dark with
the pointed feathers of spruce, bristling with grey dead trees
among grey rock, or dappled with dark and gold. The beautiful,
but fierce, heavy cruel mountains, with their moments of
tenderness.</p>

<p>She saw Tansy start, and begin to run. Two ghost-like figures
on horseback emerged from the black of the spruce across the
stream. It was two Indians on horseback, swathed like seated
mummies in their pale-grey cotton blankets. Their guns jutted
beyond the saddles. They rode straight towards her, to her thread
of smoke.</p>

<p>As they came near, they unswathed themselves and greeted her,
looking at her curiously from their dark eyes. Their black hair
was somewhat untidy, the long rolled plaits on their shoulders
were soiled. They looked tired.</p>

<p>They got down from their horses near her little fire--a camp
was a camp--swathed their blankets round their hips, pulled the
saddles from their ponies and turned them loose, then sat down.
One was a young Indian whom she had met before, the other was an
older man.</p>

<p>"You all alone?" said the younger man.</p>

<p>"Romero will be here in a minute," she said, glancing back
along the trail.</p>

<p>"Ah, Romero! You with him? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Round the ridge," she said. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"We going down to Pueblo."</p>

<p>"Been out hunting? How long have you been out?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Been out five days." The young Indian gave a little
meaningless laugh.</p>

<p>"Got anything?"</p>

<p>"No. We see tracks of two deer--but not got nothing."</p>

<p>The Princess noticed a suspicious-looking bulk under one of
the saddles--surely a folded-up deer. But she said nothing.</p>

<p>"You must have been cold," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, very cold in the night. And hungry. Got nothing to eat
since yesterday. Eat it all up." And again he laughed his little
meaningless laugh. Under their dark skins, the two men looked
peaked and hungry. The Princess rummaged for food among the
saddle-bags. There was a lump of bacon--the regular
stand-back--and some bread. She gave them this, and they began
toasting slices of it on long sticks at the fire. Such was the
little camp Romero saw as he rode down the slope: the Princess in
her orange breeches, her head tied in a blue-and-brown silk
kerchief, sitting opposite the two dark-headed Indians across the
camp-fire, while one of the Indians was leaning forward toasting
bacon, his two plaits of braid-hair dangling as if wearily.</p>

<p>Romero rode up, his face expressionless. The Indians greeted
him in Spanish. He unsaddled his horse, took food from the bags,
and sat down at the camp to eat. The Princess went to the stream
for water, and to wash her hands.</p>

<p>"Got coffee?" asked the Indians.</p>

<p>"No coffee this outfit," said Romero.</p>

<p>They lingered an hour or more in the warm midday sun. Then
Romero saddled the horses. The Indians still squatted by the
fire. Romero and the Princess rode away, calling <i>Adios!</i> to
the Indians over the stream and into the dense spruce whence two
strange figures had emerged.</p>

<p>When they were alone, Romero turned and looked at her
curiously, in a way she could not understand, with such a hard
glint in his eyes. And for the first time she wondered if she was
rash.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't mind going alone with me," she said.</p>

<p>"If you want it," he replied.</p>

<p>They emerged at the foot of the great bare slope of rocky
summit, where dead spruce trees stood sparse and bristling like
bristles on a grey dead hog. Romero said the Mexicans, twenty
years back, had fired the mountains, to drive out the whites.
This grey concave slope of summit was corpse-like.</p>

<p>The trail was almost invisible. Romero watched for the trees
which the Forest Service had blazed. And they climbed the stark
corpse slope, among dead spruce, fallen and ash-grey, into the
wind. The wind came rushing from the west, up the funnel of the
canyon, from the desert. And there was the desert, like a vast
mirage tilting slowly upwards towards the west, immense and
pallid, away beyond the funnel of the canyon. The Princess could
hardly look.</p>

<p>For an hour their horses rushed the slope, hastening with a
great working of the haunches upwards, and halting to breathe,
scrambling again, and rowing their way up length by length, on
the livid, slanting wall. While the wind blew like some vast
machine.</p>

<p>After an hour they were working their way on the incline, no
longer forcing straight up. All was grey and dead around them;
the horses picked their way over the silver-grey corpses of the
spruce. But they were near the top, near the ridge.</p>

<p>Even the horses made a rush for the last bit. They had worked
round to a scrap of spruce forest near the very top. They hurried
in, out of the huge, monstrous, mechanical wind, that whistled
inhumanly and was palely cold. So, stepping through the dark
screen of trees, they emerged over the crest.</p>

<p>In front now was nothing but mountains, ponderous, massive,
down-sitting mountains, in a huge and intricate knot, empty of
life or soul. Under the bristling black feathers of spruce
near-by lay patches of white snow. The lifeless valleys were
concaves of rock and spruce, the rounded summits and the
hog-backed summits of grey rock crowded one behind the other like
some monstrous herd in arrest.</p>

<p>It frightened the Princess, it was <i>so</i> inhuman. She had
not thought it could be so inhuman, so, as it were, anti-life.
And yet now one of her desires was fulfilled. She had seen it,
the massive, gruesome, repellent core of the Rockies. She saw it
there beneath her eyes, in its gigantic, heavy gruesomeness.</p>

<p>And she wanted to go back. At this moment she wanted to turn
back. She had looked down into the intestinal knot of these
mountains. She was frightened. She wanted to go back.</p>

<p>But Romero was riding on, on the lee side of the spruce
forest, above the concaves of the inner mountains. He turned
round to her and pointed at the slope with a dark hand.</p>

<p>"Here a miner has been trying for gold," he said. It was a
grey scratched-out heap near a hole--like a great badger hole.
And it looked quite fresh.</p>

<p>"Quite lately?" said the Princess.</p>

<p>"No, long ago--twenty, thirty years." He had reined in his
horse and was looking at the mountains. "Look!" he said. "There
goes the Forest Service trail--along those ridges, on the top,
way over there till it comes to Lucytown, where is the Goverment
road. We go down there--no trail--see behind that mountain--you
see the top, no trees, and some grass?"</p>

<p>His arm was lifted, his brown hand pointing, his dark eyes
piercing into the distance, as he sat on his black horse twisting
round to her. Strange and ominous, only the demon of himself, he
seemed to her. She was dazed and a little sick, at that height,
and she could not see any more. Only she saw an eagle turning in
the air beyond, and the light from the west showed the pattern on
him underneath.</p>

<p>"Shall I ever be able to go so far?" asked the Princess
faintly, petulantly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes! All easy now. No more hard places."</p>

<p>They worked along the ridge, up and down, keeping on the lee
side, the inner side, in the dark shadow. It was cold. Then the
trail laddered up again, and they emerged on a narrow
ridge-track, with the mountain slipping away enormously on either
side. The Princess was afraid. For one moment she looked out, and
saw the desert, the desert ridges, more desert, more blue ridges,
shining pale and very vast, far below, vastly palely tilting to
the western horizon. It was ethereal and terrifying in its
gleaming, pale, half-burnished immensity, tilted at the west. She
could not bear it. To the left was the ponderous, involved mass
of mountains all kneeling heavily.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and let her consciousness evaporate away.
The mare followed the trail. So on and on, in the wind again.</p>

<p>They turned their backs to the wind, facing inwards to the
mountains. She thought they had left the trail; it was quite
invisible.</p>

<p>"No," he said, lifting his hand and pointing. "Don't you see
the blazed trees?"</p>

<p>And making an effort of consciousness, she was able to
perceive on a pale-grey dead spruce stem the old marks where an
axe had chipped a piece away. But with the height, the cold, the
wind, her brain was numb.</p>

<p>They turned again and began to descend; he told her they had
left the trail. The horses slithered in the loose stones, picking
their way downward. It was afternoon, the sun stood obtrusive and
gleaming in the lower heavens--about four o'clock. The horses
went steadily, slowly, but obstinately onwards. The air was
getting colder. They were in among the lumpish peaks and steep
concave valleys. She was barely conscious at all of Romero.</p>

<p>He dismounted and came to help her from her saddle. She
tottered, but would not betray her feebleness.</p>

<p>"We must slide down here," he said. "I can lead the
horses."</p>

<p>They were on a ridge, and facing a steep bare slope of pallid,
tawny mountain grass on which the western sun shone full. It was
steep and concave. The Princess felt she might start slipping,
and go down like a toboggan into the great hollow.</p>

<p>But she pulled herself together. Her eye blazed up again with
excitement and determination. A wind rushed past her; she could
hear the shriek of spruce trees far below. Bright spots came on
her cheeks as her hair blew across. She looked a wild, fairy-like
little thing.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I will take my horse."</p>

<p>"Then mind she doesn't slip down on top of you," said Romero.
And away he went, nimbly dropping down the pale, steep incline,
making from rock to rock, down the grass, and following any
little slanting groove. His horse hopped and slithered after him,
and sometimes stopped dead, with forefeet pressed back, refusing
to go farther. He, below his horse, looked up and pulled the
reins gently, and encouraged the creature. Then the horse once
more dropped his forefeet with a jerk, and the descent
continued.</p>

<p>The Princess set off in blind, reckless pursuit, tottering and
yet nimble. And Romero, looking constantly back to see how she
was faring, saw her fluttering down like some queer little bird,
her orange breeches twinkling like the legs of some duck, and her
head, tied in the blue and buff kerchief, bound round and round
like the head of some blue-topped bird. The sorrel mare rocked
and slipped behind her. But down came the Princess in a reckless
intensity, a tiny, vivid spot on the great hollow flank of the
tawny mountain. So tiny! Tiny as a frail bird's egg. It made
Romero's mind go blank with wonder.</p>

<p>But they had to get down, out of that cold and dragging wind.
The spruce trees stood below, where a tiny stream emerged in
stones. Away plunged Romero, zigzagging down. And away behind, up
the slope, fluttered the tiny, bright-coloured Princess, holding
the end of the long reins, and leading the lumbering,
four-footed, sliding mare.</p>

<p>At last they were down. Romero sat in the sun, below the wind,
beside some squaw-berry bushes. The Princess came near, the
colour flaming in her cheeks, her eyes dark blue, much darker
than the kerchief on her head, and glowing unnaturally.</p>

<p>"We make it," said Romero.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Princess, dropping the reins and subsiding on
to the grass, unable to speak, unable to think.</p>

<p>But, thank heaven, they were out of the wind and in the
sun.</p>

<p>In a few minutes her consciousness and her control began to
come back. She drank a little water. Romero was attending to the
saddles. Then they set off again, leading the horses still a
little farther down the tiny stream-bed. Then they could
mount.</p>

<p>They rode down a bank and into a valley grove dense with
aspens. Winding through the thin, crowding, pale-smooth stems,
the sun shone flickering beyond them, and the disc-like aspen
leaves, waving queer mechanical signals, seemed to be splashing
the gold light before her eyes. She rode on in a splashing dazzle
of gold.</p>

<p>Then they entered shadow and the dark, resinous spruce trees.
The fierce boughs always wanted to sweep her off her horse. She
had to twist and squirm past.</p>

<p>But there was a semblance of an old trail. And all at once
they emerged in the sun on the edge of the spruce grove, and
there was a little cabin, and the bottom of a small, naked valley
with grey rock and heaps of stones, and a round pool of intense
green water, dark green. The sun was just about to leave it.</p>

<p>Indeed, as she stood, the shadow came over the cabin and over
herself; they were in the lower gloom, a twilight. Above, the
heights still blazed.</p>

<p>It was a little hole of a cabin, near the spruce trees, with
an earthen floor and an unhinged door. There was a wooden
bed-bunk, three old sawn-off log-lengths to sit on as stools, and
a sort of fireplace; no room for anything else. The little hole
would hardly contain two people. The roof had gone--but Romero
had laid on thick spruce boughs.</p>

<p>The strange squalor of the primitive forest pervaded the
place, the squalor of animals and their droppings, the squalor of
the wild. The Princess knew the peculiar repulsiveness of it. She
was tired and faint.</p>

<p>Romero hastily got a handful of twigs, set a little fire going
in the stove grate, and went out to attend to the horses. The
Princess vaguely, mechanically, put sticks on the fire, in a sort
of stupor, watching the blaze, stupefied and fascinated. She
could not make much fire--it would set the whole cabin alight.
And smoke oozed out of the dilapidated mud-and-stone chimney.</p>

<p>When Romero came in with the saddle-pouches and saddles,
hanging the saddles on the wall, there sat the little Princess on
her stump of wood in front of the dilapidated fire-grate, warming
her tiny hands at the blaze, while her oranges breeches glowed
almost like another fire. She was in a sort of stupor.</p>

<p>"You have some whisky now, or some tea? Or wait for some
soup?" he asked.</p>

<p>She rose and looked at him with bright, dazed eyes, half
comprehending; the colour glowing hectic in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Some tea," she said, "with a little whisky in it. Where's the
kettle?"</p>

<p>"Wait," he said. "I'll bring the things."</p>

<p>She took her cloak from the back of her saddle, and followed
him into the open. It was a deep cup of shadow. But above the sky
was still shining, and the heights of the mountains were blazing
with aspen like fire blazing.</p>

<p>Their horses were cropping the grass among the stones. Romero
clambered up a heap of grey stones and began lifting away logs
and rocks, till he had opened the mouth of one of the miner's
little old workings. This was his cache. He brought out bundles
of blankets, pans for cooking, a little petrol camp-stove, an
axe, the regular camp outfit. He seemed so quick and energetic
and full of force. This quick force dismayed the Princess a
little.</p>

<p>She took a saucepan and went down the stones to the water. It
was very still and mysterious, and of a deep green colour, yet
pure, transparent as glass. How cold the place was! How
mysterious and fearful.</p>

<p>She crouched in her dark cloak by the water, rinsing the
saucepan, feeling the cold heavy above her, the shadow like a
vast weight upon her, bowing her down. The sun was leaving the
mountain-tops, departing, leaving her under profound shadow. Soon
it would crush her down completely.</p>

<p>Sparks? Or eyes looking at her across the water? She gazed,
hypnotised. And with her sharp eyes she made out in the dusk the
pale form of a bob-cat crouching by the water's edge, pale as the
stones among which it crouched, opposite. And it was watching her
with cold, electric eyes of strange intentness, a sort of cold,
icy wonder and fearlessness. She saw its <i>museau</i> pushed
forward, its tufted ears pricking intensely up. It was watching
her with cold, animal curiosity, something demonish and
conscienceless.</p>

<p>She made a swift movement, spilling her water. And in a flash
the creature was gone, leaping like a cat that is escaping; but
strange and soft in its motion, with its little bob-tail. Rather
fascinating. Yet that cold, intent, demonish watching! She
shivered with cold and fear. She knew well enough the dread and
repulsiveness of the wild.</p>

<p>Romero carried in the bundles of bedding and the camp outfit.
The windowless cabin was already dark inside. He lit a lantern,
and then went out again with the axe. She heard him chopping wood
as she fed sticks to the fire under her water. When he came in
with an armful of oak-scrub faggots, she had just thrown the tea
into the water.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said, "and drink tea."</p>

<p>He poured a little bootleg whisky into the enamel cups, and in
the silence the two sat on the log-ends, sipping the hot liquid
and coughing occasionally from the smoke.</p>

<p>"We burn these oak sticks," he said. "They don't make hardly
any smoke."</p>

<p>Curious and remote he was, saying nothing except what had to
be said. And she, for her part, was as remote from him. They
seemed far, far apart, worlds apart, now they were so near.</p>

<p>He unwrapped one bundle of bedding, and spread the blankets
and the sheepskin in the wooden bunk.</p>

<p>"You lie down and rest," he said, "and I make the supper."</p>

<p>She decided to do so. Wrapping her cloak round her, she lay
down in the bunk, turning her face to the wall. She could hear
him preparing supper over the little petrol stove. Soon she could
smell the soup he was heating; and soon she heard the hissing of
fried chicken in a pan.</p>

<p>"You eat your supper now?" he said.</p>

<p>With a jerky, despairing movement, she sat up in the bunk,
tossing back her hair. She felt cornered.</p>

<p>"Give it me here," she said.</p>

<p>He handed her first the cupful of soup. She sat among the
blankets, eating it slowly. She was hungry. Then he gave her an
enamel plate with pieces of fried chicken and currant jelly,
butter and bread. It was very good. As they ate the chicken he
made the coffee. She said never a word. A certain resentment
filled her. She was cornered.</p>

<p>When supper was over he washed the dishes, dried them, and put
everything away carefully, else there would have been no room to
move in the hole of a cabin. The oak-wood gave out a good bright
heat.</p>

<p>He stood for a few moments at a loss. Then he asked her:</p>

<p>"You want to go to bed soon?"</p>

<p>"Soon," she said. "Where are you going to sleep?"</p>

<p>"I make my bed here--" he pointed to the floor along the wall.
"Too cold out of doors."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I suppose it is."</p>

<p>She sat immobile, her cheeks hot, full of conflicting
thoughts. And she watched him while he folded the blankets on the
floor, a sheepskin underneath. Then she went out into night.</p>

<p>The stars were big. Mars sat on the edge of a mountain, for
all the world like the blazing eye of a crouching mountain lion.
But she herself was deep, deep below in a pit of shadow. In the
intense silence she seemed to hear the spruce forest crackling
with electricity and cold. Strange, foreign stars floated on that
unmoving water. The night was going to freeze. Over the hills
came the far sobbing-singing howling of the coyotes. She wondered
how the horses would be.</p>

<p>Shuddering a little, she turned to the cabin. Warm light
showed through its chinks. She pushed at the rickety, half-opened
door.</p>

<p>"What about the horses?" she said.</p>

<p>"My black, he won't go away. And your mare will stay with him.
You want to go to bed now?"</p>

<p>"I think I do."</p>

<p>"All right. I feed the horses some oats."</p>

<p>And he went out into the night.</p>

<p>He did not come back for some time. She was lying wrapped up
tight in the bunk.</p>

<p>He blew out the lantern, and sat down on his bedding to take
off his clothes. She lay with her back turned. And soon, in the
silence, she was asleep.</p>

<p>She dreamed it was snowing, and the snow was falling on her
through the roof, softly, softly, helplessly, and she was going
to be buried alive. She was growing colder and colder, the snow
was weighing down on her. The snow was going to absorb her.</p>

<p>She awoke with a sudden convulsion, like pain. She was really
very cold; perhaps the heavy blankets had numbed her. Her heart
seemed unable to beat, she felt she could not move.</p>

<p>With another convulsion she sat up. It was intensely dark.
There was not even a spark of fire, the light wood had burned
right away. She sat in thick oblivious darkness. Only through a
chink she could see a star.</p>

<p>What did she want? Oh, what did she want? She sat in bed and
rocked herself woefully. She could hear the steady breathing of
the sleeping man. She was shivering with cold; her heart seemed
as if it could not beat. She wanted warmth, protection, she
wanted to be taken away from herself. And at the same time,
perhaps more deeply than anything, she wanted to keep herself
intact, intact, untouched, that no one should have any power over
her, or rights to her. It was a wild necessity in her that no
one, particularly no man, should have any rights or power over
her, that no one and nothing should possess her.</p>

<p>Yet that other thing! And she was so cold, so shivering, and
her heart could not beat. Oh, would not someone help her heart to
beat?</p>

<p>She tried to speak, and could not. Then she cleared her
throat.</p>

<p>"Romero," she said strangely, "it is so cold."</p>

<p>Where did her voice come from, and whose voice was it, in the
dark?</p>

<p>She heard him at once sit up, and his voice, startled, with a
resonance that seemed to vibrate against her, saying:</p>

<p>"You want me to make you warm?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>As soon as he had lifted her in his arms, she wanted to scream
to him not to touch her. She stiffened herself. Yet she was
dumb.</p>

<p>And he was warm, but with a terrible animal warmth that seemed
to annihilate her. He panted like an animal with desire. And she
was given over to this thing.</p>

<p>She had never, never wanted to be given over to this. But she
had <i>willed</i> that it should happen to her. And according to
her will, she lay and let it happen. But she never wanted it. She
never wanted to be thus assailed and handled, and mauled. She
wanted to keep herself to herself.</p>

<p>However, she had willed it to happen, and it had happened. She
panted with relief when it was over.</p>

<p>Yet even now she had to lie within the hard, powerful clasp of
this other creature, this man. She dreaded to struggle to go
away. She dreaded almost too much the icy cold of that other
bunk.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go away from me?" asked his strange voice. Oh,
if it could only have been a thousand miles away from her! Yet
she had willed to have it thus close.</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>And she could feel a curious joy and pride surging up again in
him: at her expense. Because he had got her. She felt like a
victim there. And he was exulting in his power over her, his
possession, his pleasure.</p>

<p>When dawn came, he was fast asleep. She sat up suddenly.</p>

<p>"I want a fire," she said.</p>

<p>He opened his brown eyes wide, and smiled with a curious
tender luxuriousness.</p>

<p>"I want you to make a fire," she said.</p>

<p>He glanced at the chinks of light. His brown face hardened to
the day.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I'll make it."</p>

<p>She did her face while he dressed. She could not bear to look
at him. He was so suffused with pride and luxury. She hid her
face almost in despair. But feeling the cold blast of air as he
opened the door, she wriggled down into the warm place where he
had been. How soon the warmth ebbed, when he had gone!</p>

<p>He made a fire and went out, returning after a while with
water.</p>

<p>"You stay in bed till the sun comes," he said. "It very
cold."</p>

<p>"Hand me my cloak."</p>

<p>She wrapped the cloak fast round her, and sat up among the
blankets. The warmth was already spreading from the fire.</p>

<p>"I suppose we will start back as soon as we've had
breakfast?"</p>

<p>He was crouching at his camp-stove making scrambled eggs. He
looked up suddenly, transfixed, and his brown eyes, so soft and
luxuriously widened, looked straight at her.</p>

<p>"You want to?" he said.</p>

<p>"We'd better get back as soon as possible," she said, turning
aside from his eyes.</p>

<p>"You want to get away from me?" he asked, repeating the
question of the night in a sort of dread.</p>

<p>"I want to get away from here," she said decisively. And it
was true. She wanted supremely to get away, back to the world of
people.</p>

<p>He rose slowly to his feet, holding the aluminium
frying-pan.</p>

<p>"Don't you like last night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not really," she said. "Why? Do you?"</p>

<p>He put down the frying-pan and stood staring at the wall. She
could see she had given him a cruel blow. But she did not relent.
She was getting her own back. She wanted to regain possession of
all herself, and in some mysterious way she felt that he
possessed some part of her still.</p>

<p>He looked round at her slowly, his face greyish and heavy.</p>

<p>"You Americans," he said, "you always want to do a man
down."</p>

<p>"I am not American," she said. "I am British. And I don't want
to do any man down. I only want to go back now."</p>

<p>"And what will you say about me, down there?"</p>

<p>"That you were very kind to me, and very good."</p>

<p>He crouched down again, and went on turning the eggs. He gave
her her plate, and her coffee, and sat down to his own food.</p>

<p>But again he seemed not to be able to swallow. He looked up at
her.</p>

<p>"You don't like last night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not really," she said, though with some difficulty. "I don't
care for that kind of thing."</p>

<p>A blank sort of wonder spread over his face at these words,
followed immediately by a black look of anger, and then a stony,
sinister despair.</p>

<p>"You don't?" he said, looking her in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Not really," she replied, looking back with steady hostility
into his eyes.</p>

<p>Then a dark flame seemed to come from his face.</p>

<p>"I make you," he said, as if to himself.</p>

<p>He rose and reached her clothes, that hung on a peg: the fine
linen underwear, the orange breeches, the fleecy jumper, the
blue-and-bluff kerchief; then he took up her riding-boots and her
bead moccasins. Crushing everything in his arms, he opened the
door. Sitting up, she saw him stride down to the dark-green pool
in the frozen shadow of that deep cup of a valley. He tossed the
clothing and the boots out on the pool. Ice had formed. And on
the pure, dark green mirror, in the slaty shadow, the Princess
saw her things lying, the white linen, the orange breeches, the
black boots, the blue moccasins, a tangled heap of colour. Romero
picked up rocks and heaved them out at the ice, till the surface
broke and the fluttering clothing disappeared in the rattling
water, while the valley echoed and shouted again with the
sound.</p>

<p>She sat in despair among the blankets, hugging tight her
pale-blue cloak. Romero strode straight back to the cabin.</p>

<p>"Now you stay here with me," he said.</p>

<p>She was furious. Her blue eyes met his. They were like two
demons watching one another. In his face, beyond a sort of
unrelieved gloom, was a demonish desire for death.</p>

<p>He saw her looking round the cabin, scheming. He saw her eyes
on his rifle. He took the gun and went out with it. Returning, he
pulled out her saddle, carried it to the tarn, and threw it in.
Then he fetched his own saddle, and did the same.</p>

<p>"Now will you go away?" he said, looking at her with a
smile.</p>

<p>She debated within herself whether to coax him and wheedle
him. But she knew he was already beyond it. She sat among her
blankets in a frozen sort of despair, hard as hard ice with
anger.</p>

<p>He did the chores, and disappeared with the gun. She got up in
her blue pyjamas, huddled in her cloak, and stood in the doorway.
The dark-green pool was motionless again, the stony slopes were
pallid and frozen. Shadow still lay, like an after-death, deep in
this valley. Always in the distance she saw the horses feeding.
If she could catch one! The brilliant yellow sun was half-way
down the mountain. It was nine o'clock.</p>

<p>All day she was alone, and she was frightened. What she was
frightened of she didn't know. Perhaps the crackling in the dark
spruce wood. Perhaps just the savage, heartless wildness of the
mountains. But all day she sat in the sun in the doorway of the
cabin, watching, watching for hope. And all the time her bowels
were cramped with fear.</p>

<p>She saw a dark spot that probably was a bear, roving across
the pale grassy slope in the far distance, in the sun.</p>

<p>When, in the afternoon, she saw Romero approaching, with
silent suddenness, carrying his gun and a dead deer, the cramp in
her bowels relaxed, then became colder. She dreaded him with a
cold dread.</p>

<p>"There is deer-meat," he said, throwing the dead doe at her
feet.</p>

<p>"You don't want to go away from here," he said. "This is a
nice place."</p>

<p>She shrank into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Come into the sun," he said, following her. She looked up at
him with hostile, frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"Come into the sun," he repeated, taking her gently by the
arm, in a powerful grasp.</p>

<p>She knew it was useless to rebel. Quietly he led her out, and
seated himself in the doorway, holding her still by the arm.</p>

<p>"In the sun it is warm," he said. "Look, this is a nice place.
You are such a pretty white woman, why do you want to act mean to
me? Isn't this a nice place? Come! Come here! It is sure warm
here."</p>

<p>He drew her to him, and in spite of her stony resistance, he
took her cloak from her, holding her in her thin blue
pyjamas.</p>

<p>"You sure are a pretty little white woman, small and pretty,"
he said. "You sure won't act mean to me--you don't want to, I
know you don't."</p>

<p>She, stony and powerless, had to submit to him. The sun shone
on her white, delicate skin.</p>

<p>"I sure don't mind hell fire," he said. "After this."</p>

<p>A queer, luxurious good humour seemed to possess him again.
But though outwardly she was powerless, inwardly she resisted
him, absolutely and stonily.</p>

<p>When later he was leaving her again, she said to him
suddenly:</p>

<p>"You think you can conquer me this way. But you can't. You can
never conquer me."</p>

<p>He stood arrested, looking back at her, with many emotions
conflicting in his face--wonder, surprise, a touch of horror, and
an unconscious pain that crumpled his face till it was like a
mask. Then he went out without saying a word, hung the dead deer
on a bough, and started to flay it. While he was at this
butcher's work, the sun sank and cold night came on again.</p>

<p>"You see," he said to her as he crouched, cooking the supper,
"I ain't going to let you go. I reckon you called to me in the
night, and I've some right. If you want to fix it up right now
with me, and say you want to be with me, we'll fix it up now and
go down to the ranch to-morrow and get married or whatever you
want. But you've got to say you want to be with me. Else I shall
stay right here, till something happens."</p>

<p>She waited a while before she answered:</p>

<p>"I don't want to be with anybody against my will. I don't
dislike you; at least, I didn't, till you tried to put your will
over mine. I won't have anybody's will put over me. You can't
succeed. Nobody could. You can never get me under your will. And
you won't have long to try, because soon they will send someone
to look for me."</p>

<p>He pondered this last, and she regretted having said it. Then,
sombre, he bent to the cooking again.</p>

<p>He could not conquer her, however much he violated her.
Because her spirit was hard and flawless as a diamond. But he
could shatter her. This she knew. Much more, and she would be
shattered.</p>

<p>In a sombre, violent excess he tried to expend his desire for
her. And she was racked with an agony, and felt each time she
would die. Because, in some peculiar way, he had got hold of her,
some unrealised part of her which she never wished to realise.
Racked with a burning, tearing anguish, she felt that the thread
of her being would break, and she would die. The burning heat
that racked her inwardly.</p>

<p>If only, only she could be alone again, cool and intact! If
only she could recover herself again, cool and intact! Would she
ever, ever, ever be able to bear herself again?</p>

<p>Even now she did not hate him. It was beyond that. Like some
racking, hot doom. Personally he hardly existed.</p>

<p>The next day he would not let her have any fire, because of
attracting attention with the smoke. It was a grey day, and she
was cold. He stayed round, and heated soup on the petrol stove.
She lay motionless in the blankets.</p>

<p>And in the afternoon she pulled the clothes over her head and
broke into tears. She had never really cried in her life. He
dragged the blankets away and looked to see what was shaking her.
She sobbed in helpless hysterics. He covered her over again and
went outside, looking at the mountains, where clouds were
dragging and leaving a little snow. It was a violent, windy,
horrible day, the evil of winter rushing down.</p>

<p>She cried for hours. And after this a great silence came
between them. They were two people who had died. He did not touch
her any more. In the night she lay and shivered like a dying dog.
She felt that her very shivering would rupture something in her
body, and she would die.</p>

<p>At last she had to speak.</p>

<p>"Could you make a fire? I am so cold," she said, with
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>"Want to come over here?" came his voice.</p>

<p>"I would rather you made me a fire," she said, her teeth
knocking together and chopping the words in two.</p>

<p>He got up and kindled a fire. At last the warmth spread, and
she could sleep.</p>

<p>The next day was still chilly, with some wind. But the sun
shone. He went about in silence, with a dead-looking face. It was
now so dreary and so like death she wished he would do anything
rather than continue in this negation. If now he asked her to go
down with him to the world and marry him, she would do it. What
did it matter? Nothing mattered any more.</p>

<p>But he would not ask her. His desire was dead and heavy like
ice within him. He kept watch around the house.</p>

<p>On the fourth day as she sat huddled in the doorway in the
sun, hugged in a blanket, she saw two horsemen come over the
crest of the grassy slope--small figures. She gave a cry. He
looked up quickly and saw the figures. The men had dismounted.
They were looking for the trail.</p>

<p>"They are looking for me," she said.</p>

<p>"<i>Muy bien</i>," he answered in Spanish.</p>

<p>He went and fetched his gun, and sat with it across his
knees.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said. "Don't shoot!"</p>

<p>He looked across at her.</p>

<p>"Why?" he said. "You like staying with me?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "But don't shoot."</p>

<p>"I ain't going to Pen," he said.</p>

<p>"You won't have to go to Pen," she said. "Don't shoot!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to shoot," he muttered.</p>

<p>And straightaway he kneeled and took very careful aim. The
Princess sat on in an agony of helplessness and hopelessness.</p>

<p>The shot rang out. In an instant she saw one of the horses on
the pale grassy slope rear and go rolling down. The man had
dropped in the grass, and was invisible. The second man clambered
on his horse, and on that precipitous place went at a gallop in a
long swerve towards the nearest spruce tree cover. Bang! Bang!
went Romero's shots. But each time he missed, and the running
horse leaped like a kangaroo towards cover.</p>

<p>It was hidden. Romero now got behind a rock; tense silence, in
the brilliant sunshine. The Princess sat on the bunk inside the
cabin, crouching, paralysed. For hours, it seemed, Romero knelt
behind this rock, in his black shirt, bare-headed, watching. He
had a beautiful, alert figure. The Princess wondered why she did
not feel sorry for him. But her spirit was hard and cold, her
heart could not melt. Though now she would have called him to
her, with love.</p>

<p>But no, she did not love him. She would never love any man.
Never! It was fixed and sealed in her, almost vindictively.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was so startled she almost fell from the bunk. A
shot rang out quite close from behind the cabin. Romero leaped
straight into the air, his arms fell outstretched, turning as he
leaped. And even while he was in the air, a second shot rang out,
and he fell with a crash, squirming, his hands clutching the
earth towards the cabin door.</p>

<p>The Princess sat absolutely motionless, transfixed, staring at
the prostrate figure. In a few moments the figure of a man in the
Forest Service appeared close to the house; a young man in a
broad-brimmed Stetson hat, dark flannel shirt, and riding-boots,
carrying a gun. He strode over to the prostrate figure.</p>

<p>"Got you, Romero!" he said aloud. And he turned the dead man
over. There was already a little pool of blood where Romero's
breast had been.</p>

<p>"H'm!" said the Forest Service man. "Guess I got you nearer
than I thought."</p>

<p>And he squatted there, staring at the dead man.</p>

<p>The distant calling of his comrade aroused him. He stood
up.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Bill!" he shouted. "Yep! Got him! Yep! Done him in,
apparently."</p>

<p>The second man rode out of the forest on a grey horse. He had
a ruddy, kind face, and round brown eyes, dilated with
dismay.</p>

<p>"He's not passed out?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Looks like it," said the first young man coolly.</p>

<p>The second dismounted and bent over the body. Then he stood up
again, and nodded.</p>

<p>"Yea-a!" he said. "He's done in all right. It's him all right,
boy! It's Domingo Romero."</p>

<p>"Yep! I know it!" replied the other.</p>

<p>Then in perplexity he turned and looked into the cabin, where
the Princess squatted, staring with big owl eyes from her red
blanket.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he said, coming towards the hut. And he took his hat
off. Oh, the sense of ridicule she felt! Though he did not mean
any.</p>

<p>But she could not speak, no matter what she felt.</p>

<p>"What'd this man start firing for?" he asked.</p>

<p>She fumbled for words, with numb lips.</p>

<p>"He had gone out of his mind!" she said, with solemn,
stammering conviction.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! You mean to say he'd gone out of his mind? Whew!
That's pretty awful! That explains it then. H'm!"</p>

<p>He accepted the explanation without more ado.</p>

<p>With some difficulty they succeeded in getting the Princess
down to the ranch. But she, too, was not a little mad.</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure where I am," she said to Mrs. Wilkieson,
as she lay in bed. "Do you mind explaining?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilkieson explained tactfully.</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" said the Princess. "I remember. And I had an
accident in the mountains, didn't I? Didn't we meet a man who'd
gone mad, and who shot my horse from under me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you met a man who had gone out of his mind."</p>

<p>The real affair was hushed up. The Princess departed east in a
fortnight's time, in Miss Cummins's care. Apparently she had
recovered herself entirely. She was the Princess, and a virgin
intact.</p>

<p>But her bobbed hair was grey at the temples, and her eyes were
a little mad. She was slightly crazy.</p>

<p>"Since my accident in the mountains, when a man went mad and
shot my horse from under me, and my guide had to shoot him dead,
I have never felt quite myself."</p>

<p>So she put it.</p>

<p>Later, she married an elderly man, and seemed pleased.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s13">THE WITCH <i>A LA MODE</i></a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When Bernard Coutts alighted at East Croydon he knew he was
tempting Providence.</p>

<p>"I may just as well," he said to himself, "stay the night
here, where I am used to the place, as go to London. I can't get
to Connie's forlorn spot to-night, and I'm tired to death, so why
shouldn't I do what is easiest?"</p>

<p>He gave his luggage to a porter.</p>

<p>Again, as he faced the approaching tram-car: "I don't see why
I shouldn't go down to Purley. I shall just be in time for
tea."</p>

<p>Each of these concessions to his desires he made against his
conscience. But beneath his sense of shame his spirit
exulted.</p>

<p>It was an evening of March. In the dark hollow below Crown
Hill the buildings accumulated, bearing the black bulk of the
church tower up into the rolling and smoking sunset.</p>

<p>"I know it so well," he thought. "And love it," he confessed
secretly in his heart.</p>

<p>The car ran on familiarly. The young man listened for the
swish, watched for the striking of the blue splash overhead, at
the bracket. The sudden fervour of the spark, splashed out of the
mere wire, pleased him.</p>

<p>"Where does it come from?" he asked himself, and a spark
struck bright again. He smiled a little, roused.</p>

<p>The day was dying out. One by one the arc lamps fluttered or
leaped alight, the strand of copper overhead glistened against
the dark sky that now was deepening to the colour of monkshood.
The tram-car dipped as it ran, seeming to exult. As it came clear
of the houses, the young man, looking west, saw the evening star
advance, a bright thing approaching from a long way off, as if it
had been bathing in the surf of the daylight, and now was walking
shorewards to the night. He greeted the naked star with a bow of
the head, his heart surging as the car leaped.</p>

<p>"It seems to be greeting me across the sky--the star," he
said, amused by his own vanity.</p>

<p>Above the colouring of the afterglow the blade of the new moon
hung sharp and keen. Something recoiled in him.</p>

<p>"It is like a knife to be used at a sacrifice," he said to
himself. Then, secretly: "I wonder for whom?"</p>

<p>He refused to answer this question, but he had the sense of
Constance, his betrothed, waiting for him in the Vicarage in the
north. He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Soon the car was running full-tilt from the shadow to the fume
of yellow light at the terminus, where shop on shop and lamp
beyond lamp heaped golden fire on the floor of the blue night.
The car, like an eager dog, ran in home, sniffing with pleasure
the fume of lights.</p>

<p>Coutts flung away uphill. He had forgotten he was tired. From
the distance he could distinguish the house, by the broad white
cloth of alyssum flowers that hung down the garden walls. He ran
up the steep path to the door, smelling the hyacinths in the
dark, watching for the pale fluttering of daffodils and the
steadier show of white crocuses on the grassy banks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braithwaite herself opened the door to him.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed. "I expected you. I had your card
saying you would cross from Dieppe to-day. You wouldn't make up
your mind to come here, not till the last minute, would you?
No--that's what I expected. You know where to put your things; I
don't think we've altered anything in the last year."</p>

<p>Mrs. Braithwaite chattered on, laughing all the time. She was
a young widow, whose husband had been dead two years. Of medium
height, sanguine in complexion and temper, there was a rich oily
glisten in her skin and in her black hair, suggesting the flesh
of a nut. She was dressed for the evening in a long gown of soft,
mole-coloured satin.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm delighted you've come," she said at last,
lapsing into conventional politeness, and then, seeing his eyes,
she began to laugh at her attempt at formality.</p>

<p>She let Coutts into a small, very warm room that had a dark,
foreign sheen, owing to the black of the curtains and hangings
covered thick with glistening Indian embroidery, and to the
sleekness of some Indian ware. A rosy old gentleman, with
exquisite white hair and side-whiskers, got up shakily and
stretched out his hand. His cordial expression of welcome was
rendered strange by a puzzled, wondering look of old age, and by
a certain stiffness of his countenance, which now would only
render a few expressions. He wrung the newcomer's hand heartily,
his manner contrasting pathetically with his bowed and trembling
form.</p>

<p>"Oh, why--why, yes, it's Mr. Coutts! H'm--ay. Well, and how
are you--h'm? Sit down, sit down." The old man rose again,
bowing, waving the young man into a chair. "Ay! well, and how are
you? . . . What? Have some tea--come on, come along; here's the
tray. Laura, ring for fresh tea for Mr. Courts. But I will do
it." He suddenly remembered his old gallantry, forgot his age and
uncertainty. Fumbling, he rose to go to the bell-pull.</p>

<p>"It's done, Pater--the tea will be in a minute," said his
daughter in high, distinct tones. Mr. Cleveland sank with relief
into his chair.</p>

<p>"You know, I'm beginning to be troubled with rheumatism," he
explained in confidential tones. Mrs. Braithwaite glanced at the
young man and smiled. The old gentleman babbled and chattered. He
had no knowledge of his guest beyond the fact of his presence;
Coutts might have been any other young man, for all his host was
aware.</p>

<p>"You didn't tell us you were going away. Why didn't you?"
asked Laura, in her distinct tones, between laughing and
reproach. Coutts looked at her ironically, so that she fidgeted
with some crumbs on the cloth.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "Why do we do things?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. Why do we? Because we want to, I
suppose," and she ended again with a little run of laughter.
Things were so amusing, and she was so healthy.</p>

<p>"Why <i>do</i> we do things, Pater?" she suddenly asked in a
loud voice, glancing with a little chuckle of laughter at
Coutts.</p>

<p>"Ay--why do we do things? What things?" said the old man,
beginning to laugh with his daughter.</p>

<p>"Why, any of the things that we do."</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh!" The old man was illuminated, and delighted. "Well,
now, that's a difficult question. I remember, when I was a little
younger, we used to discuss Free Will--got very hot about it . .
." He laughed, and Laura laughed, then said, in a high voice:</p>

<p>"Oh! Free Will! We shall really think you're
<i>pass&eacute;</i>, if you revive that, Pater."</p>

<p>Mr. Cleveland looked puzzled for a moment. Then, as if
answering a conundrum, he repeated:</p>

<p>"Why do we do things? Now, why <i>do</i> we do things?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, in all good faith, "it's because we
can't help it--eh? What?"</p>

<p>Laura laughed. Coutts showed his teeth in a smile.</p>

<p>"That's what I think, Pater," she said loudly.</p>

<p>"And are you still engaged to your Constance?" she asked of
Coutts, with a touch of mockery this time. Coutts nodded.</p>

<p>"And how is she?" asked the widow.</p>

<p>"I believe she is very well--unless my delay has upset her,"
said Coutts, his tongue between his teeth. It hurt him to give
pain to his fianc&eacute;e, and yet he did it wilfully.</p>

<p>"Do you know, she always reminds me of a Bunbury--I call her
your Miss Bunbury," Laura laughed.</p>

<p>Coutts did not answer.</p>

<p>"We missed you <i>so</i> much when you first went away," Laura
began, reestablishing the proprieties.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. She began to laugh wickedly.</p>

<p>"On Friday evenings," she said, adding quickly: "Oh, and this
is Friday evening, and Winifred is coming just as she used
to--how long ago?--ten months?"</p>

<p>"Ten months," Coutts corroborated.</p>

<p>"Did you quarrel with Winifred?" she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Winifred never quarrels," he answered.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she does. Then why <i>did</i> you go away?
You are such a puzzle to me, you know--and I shall never rest
till I have had it out of you. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"I like it," he said, quietly, flashing a laugh at her.</p>

<p>She laughed, then settled herself in a dignified, serious
way.</p>

<p>"No, I can't make you out at all--nor can I Winifred. You
<i>are</i> a pair! But it's you who are the real wonder. When are
you going to be married?"</p>

<p>"I don't know--When I am sufficiently well off."</p>

<p>"I <i>asked</i> Winifred to come to-night," Laura confessed.
The eyes of the man and woman met.</p>

<p>"Why is she so ironic to me?--does she really like me?" Coutts
asked of himself. But Laura looked too bonny and jolly to be
fretted by love.</p>

<p>"And Winifred won't tell me a word," she said.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell," he replied.</p>

<p>Laura looked at him closely for a few moments. Then she rose
and left the room.</p>

<p>Presently there arrived a German lady with whom Coutts was
slightly acquainted. At about half-past seven came Winifred
Varley. Courts heard the courtly old gentleman welcoming her in
the hall, heard her low voice in answer. When she entered, and
saw him, he knew it was a shock to her, though she hid it as well
as she could. He suffered too. After hesitating for a second in
the doorway, she came forward, shook hands without speaking, only
looking at him with rather frightened blue eyes. She was of
medium height, sturdy in build. Her face was white and impassive,
without the least trace of a smile. She was a blonde of
twenty-eight, dressed in a white gown just short enough not to
touch the ground. Her throat was solid and strong, her arms heavy
and white and beautiful, her blue eyes heavy with unacknowledged
passion. When she had turned away from Coutts, she flushed
vividly. He could see the pink in her arms and throat, and he
flushed in answer.</p>

<p>"That blush would hurt her," he said to himself, wincing.</p>

<p>"I did not expect to see you," she said, with a reedy timbre
of voice, as if her throat were half-closed. It made his nerves
tingle.</p>

<p>"No--nor I you. At least . . ." He ended indefinitely.</p>

<p>"You have come down from Yorkshire?" she asked. Apparently she
was cold and self-possessed. Yorkshire meant the Rectory where
his fianc&eacute;e lived; he felt the sting of sarcasm.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "I am on my way there."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Unable to resolve the situation,
she turned abruptly to her hostess.</p>

<p>"Shall we play, then?"</p>

<p>They adjourned to the drawing-room. It was a large room
upholstered in dull yellow. The chimney-piece took Coutts'
attention. He knew it perfectly well, but this evening it had a
new, lustrous fascination. Over the mellow marble of the mantel
rose an immense mirror, very translucent and deep, like deep grey
water. Before this mirror, shining white as moons on a soft grey
sky, was a pair of statues in alabaster, two feet high. Both were
nude figures. They glistened under the side lamps, rose clean and
distinct from their pedestals. The Venus leaned slightly forward,
as if anticipating someone's coming. Her attitude of suspense
made the young man stiffen. He could see the clean suavity of her
shoulders and waist reflected white on the deep mirror. She
shone, catching, as she leaned forward, the glow of the lamp on
her lustrous marble loins.</p>

<p>Laura played Brahms; the delicate, winsome German lady played
Chopin; Winifred played on her violin a Grieg sonata, to Laura's
accompaniment. After having sung twice, Coutts listened to the
music. Unable to criticise, he listened till he was intoxicated.
Winifred, as she played, swayed slightly. He watched the strong
forward thrust of her neck, the powerful and angry striking of
her arm. He could see the outline of her figure; she wore no
corsets; and he found her of resolute independent build. Again he
glanced at the Venus bending in suspense. Winifred was blonde
with a solid whiteness, an isolated woman.</p>

<p>All the evening, little was said, save by Laura. Miss Syfurt
exclaimed continually: "Oh, that is fine! You play gra-and, Miss
Varley, don't you know. If I could play the violin--ah! the
violin!"</p>

<p>It was not later than ten o'clock when Winifred and Miss
Syfurt rose to go, the former to Croydon, the latter to
Ewell.</p>

<p>"We can go by car together to West Croydon," said the German
lady, gleefully, as if she were a child. She was a frail,
excitable little woman of forty, na&iuml;ve and innocent. She
gazed with bright brown eyes of admiration on Coutts.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am glad," he answered.</p>

<p>He took up Winifred's violin, and the three proceeded downhill
to the tram-terminus. There a car was on the point of departure.
They hurried forward. Miss Syfurt mounted the step. Coutts waited
for Winifred. The conductor called:</p>

<p>"Come along, please, if you're going."</p>

<p>"No," said Winifred. "I prefer to walk this stage."</p>

<p>"We can walk from West Croydon," said Coutts.</p>

<p>The conductor rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming?" cried the frail, excitable little lady,
from the footboard. "Aren't you coming?--Oh!"</p>

<p>"I walk from West Croydon every day; I prefer to walk here, in
the quiet," said Winifred.</p>

<p>"Aw! aren't you coming with me?" cried the little lady, quite
frightened. She stepped back, in supplication, towards the
footboard. The conductor impatiently buzzed the bell. The car
started forward, Miss Syfurt staggered, was caught by the
conductor.</p>

<p>"Aw!" she cried, holding her hand out to the two who stood on
the road, and breaking almost into tears of disappointment. As
the tram darted forward she clutched at her hat. In a moment she
was out of sight.</p>

<p>Coutts stood wounded to the quick by this pain given to the
frail, child-like lady.</p>

<p>"We may as well," said Winifred, "walk over the hill to 'The
Swan'." Her note had that intense reedy quality which always set
the man on edge; it was the note of her anger, or, more often, of
her tortured sense of discord. The two turned away, to climb the
hill again. He carried the violin; for a long time neither
spoke.</p>

<p>"Ah, how I hate her, how I hate her!" he repeated in his
heart. He winced repeatedly at the thought of Miss Syfurt's
little cry of supplication. He was in a position where he was not
himself, and he hated her for putting him there, forgetting that
it was he who had come, like a moth to the candle. For half a
mile he walked on, his head carried stiffly, his face set, his
heart twisted with painful emotion. And all the time, as she
plodded, head down, beside him, his blood beat with hate of her,
drawn to her, repelled by her.</p>

<p>At last, on the high-up, naked down, they came upon those
meaningless pavements that run through the grass, waiting for the
houses to line them. The two were thrust up into the night above
the little flowering of the lamps in the valley. In front was the
daze of light from London, rising midway to the zenith, just
fainter than the stars. Across the valley, on the blackness of
the opposite hill, little groups of lights like gnats seemed to
be floating in the darkness. Orion was heeled over the West.
Below, in a cleft in the night, the long, low garland of arc
lamps strung down the Brighton Road, where now and then the
golden tram-cars flew along the track, passing each other with a
faint, angry sound.</p>

<p>"It is a year last Monday since we came over here," said
Winifred, as they stopped to look about them.</p>

<p>"I remember--but I didn't know it was then," he said. There
was a touch of hardness in his voice. "I don't remember our
dates."</p>

<p>After a wait, she said in a very low, passionate tones:</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a beautiful night."</p>

<p>"The moon has set, and the evening star," he answered; "both
were out as I came down."</p>

<p>She glanced swiftly at him to see if this speech was a bit of
symbolism. He was looking across the valley with a set face. Very
slightly, by an inch or two, she nestled towards him.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, half-stubborn, half-pleading. "But the night
is a very fine one, for all that."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, unwillingly.</p>

<p>Thus, after months of separation, they dove-tailed into the
same love and hate.</p>

<p>"You are staying down here?" she asked at length, in a forced
voice. She never intruded a hair's-breadth on the most trifling
privacy; in which she was Laura's antithesis; so that this
question was almost an impertinence for her. He felt her
shrink.</p>

<p>"Till the morning--then Yorkshire," he said cruelly.</p>

<p>He hated it that she could not bear outspokenness.</p>

<p>At that moment a train across the valley threaded the opposite
darkness with its gold thread. The valley re-echoed with vague
threat. The two watched the express, like a gold-and-black snake,
curve and dive seawards into the night. He turned, saw her full,
fine face tilted up to him. It showed pale, distinct, and firm,
very near to him. He shut his eyes and shivered.</p>

<p>"I hate trains," he said, impulsively.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, with a curious, tender little smile that
caressed, as it were, his emotion towards her.</p>

<p>"I don't know; they pitch one about here and there . . ."</p>

<p>"I thought," she said, with faint irony, "that you preferred
change."</p>

<p>"I do like life. But now I should like to be nailed to
something, if it were only a cross."</p>

<p>She laughed sharply, and said, with keen sarcasm:</p>

<p>"Is it so difficult, then, to let yourself be nailed to a
cross? I thought the difficulty lay in getting free."</p>

<p>He ignored her sarcasm on his engagement.</p>

<p>"There is nothing now that matters," he said, adding quickly,
to forestall her: "Of course I'm wild when dinner's late, and so
on; but . . . apart from those things . . . nothing seems to
matter."</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"One goes on--remains in office, so to speak; and life's all
right--only, it doesn't seem to matter."</p>

<p>"This does sound like complaining of trouble because you've
got none," she laughed.</p>

<p>"Trouble . . ." he repeated. "No, I don't suppose I've got
any. Vexation, which most folk call trouble; but something I
really grieve about in my soul--no, nothing. I wish I had."</p>

<p>She laughed again sharply; but he perceived in her laughter a
little keen despair.</p>

<p>"I find a lucky pebble. I think, now I'll throw it over my
left shoulder, and wish. So I spit over my little finger, and
throw the white pebble behind me, and then, when I want to wish,
I'm done. I say to myself: 'Wish,' and myself says back: 'I don't
want anything.' I say again: 'Wish, you fool,' but I'm as dumb of
wishes as a newt. And then, because it rather frightens me, I say
in a hurry: 'A million of money.' Do <i>you</i> know what to wish
for when you see the new moon?"</p>

<p>She laughed quickly.</p>

<p>"I think so," she said. "But my wish varies."</p>

<p>"I wish mine did," he said, whimsically lugubrious.</p>

<p>She took his hand in a little impulse of love.</p>

<p>They walked hand in hand on the ridge of the down, bunches of
lights shining below, the big radiance of London advancing like a
wonder in front.</p>

<p>"You know . . ." he began, then stopped.</p>

<p>"I don't . . ." she ironically urged.</p>

<p>"Do you want to?" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes; one is never at peace with oneself till one
understands."</p>

<p>"Understands what?" he asked brutally. He knew she meant that
she wanted to understand the situation he and she were in.</p>

<p>"How to resolve the discord," she said, balking the issue. He
would have liked her to say: "What you want of me."</p>

<p>"Your foggy weather of symbolism, as usual," he said.</p>

<p>"The fog is not of symbols," she replied, in her metallic
voice of displeasure. "It may be symbols are candles in a
fog."</p>

<p>"I prefer my fog without candles. I'm the fog, eh? Then I'll
blow out your candle, and you'll see me better. Your candles of
speech, symbols and so forth, only lead you more wrong. I'm going
to wander blind, and go by instinct, like a moth that flies and
settles on the wooden box his mate is shut up in."</p>

<p>"Isn't it an <i>ignis fatuus</i> you are flying after, at that
rate?" she said.</p>

<p>"Maybe, for if I breathe outwards, in the positive movement
towards you, you move off. If I draw in a vacant sigh of
soulfulness, you flow nearly to my lips."</p>

<p>"This is a very interesting symbol," she said, with sharp
sarcasm.</p>

<p>He hated her, truly. She hated him. Yet they held hands fast
as they walked.</p>

<p>"We are just the same as we were a year ago," he laughed. But
he hated her, for all his laughter.</p>

<p>When, at the "Swan and Sugar-Loaf", they mounted the car, she
climbed to the top, in spite of the sharp night. They nestled
side by side, shoulders caressing, and all the time that they ran
under the round lamps neither spoke.</p>

<p>At the gate of a small house in a dark tree-lined street, both
waited a moment. From her garden leaned an almond tree whose
buds, early this year, glistened in the light of the street lamp,
with theatrical effect. He broke off a twig.</p>

<p>"I always remember this tree," he said; "how I used to feel
sorry for it when it was full out, and so lively, at midnight in
the lamplight. I thought it must be tired."</p>

<p>"Will you come in?" she asked tenderly.</p>

<p>"I did get a room in town," he answered, following her.</p>

<p>She opened the door with her latch-key, showing him, as usual,
into the drawing-room. Everything was just the same; cold in
colouring, warm in appointment; ivory-coloured walls, blond,
polished floor, with thick ivory-coloured rugs; three deep
arm-chairs in pale amber, with large cushions; a big black piano,
a violin-stand beside it; and the room very warm with a clear red
fire, the brass shining hot. Coutts, according to his habit, lit
the piano-candles and lowered the blinds.</p>

<p>"I say," he said; "this is a variation from your line!"</p>

<p>He pointed to a bowl of magnificent scarlet anemones that
stood on the piano.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, pausing in arranging her hair at the small
mirror.</p>

<p>"On the <i>piano</i>!" he admonished.</p>

<p>"Only while the table was in use," she smiled, glancing at the
litter of papers that covered her table.</p>

<p>"And then--<i>red</i> flowers!" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought they were such a fine piece of colour," she
replied.</p>

<p>"I would have wagered you would buy freesias," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" she smiled. He pleased her thus.</p>

<p>"Well--for their cream and gold and restrained, bruised
purple, and their scent. I can't believe you bought scentless
flowers!"</p>

<p>"What!" She went forward, bent over the flowers.</p>

<p>"I had not noticed," she said, smiling curiously, "that they
were scentless."</p>

<p>She touched the velvet black centres.</p>

<p>"Would you have bought them had you noticed?" he asked.</p>

<p>She thought for a moment, curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know . . . probably I should not."</p>

<p>"You would never buy scentless flowers," he averred. "Any more
than you'd love a man because he was handsome."</p>

<p>"I did not know," she smiled. She was pleased.</p>

<p>The housekeeper entered with a lamp, which she set on a
stand.</p>

<p>"You will illuminate me?" he said to Winifred. It was her
habit to talk to him by candle-light.</p>

<p>"I have thought about you--now I will look at you," she said
quietly, smiling.</p>

<p>"I see--To confirm your conclusions?" he asked.</p>

<p>Her eyes lifted quickly in acknowledgment of his guess.</p>

<p>"That is so," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then," he said, "I'll wash my hands."</p>

<p>He ran upstairs. The sense of freedom, of intimacy, was very
fascinating. As he washed, the little everyday action of twining
his hands in the lather set him suddenly considering his other
love. At her house he was always polite and formal; gentlemanly,
in short. With Connie he felt the old, manly superiority; he was
the knight, strong and tender, she was the beautiful maiden with
a touch of God on her brow. He kissed her, he softened and
selected his speech for her, he forbore from being the greater
part of himself. She was his betrothed, his wife, his queen, whom
he loved to idealise, and for whom he carefully modified himself.
She should rule him later on--that part of him which was hers.
But he loved her, too, with a pitying, tender love. He thought of
her tears upon her pillow in the northern Rectory, and he bit his
lip, held his breath under the strain of the situation. Vaguely
he knew she would bore him. And Winifred fascinated him. He and
she really played with fire. In her house, he was roused and
keen. But she was not, and never could be, frank. So he was not
frank, even to himself. Saying nothing, betraying nothing,
immediately they were together they began the same game. Each
shuddered, each defenceless and exposed, hated the other by
turns. Yet they came together again. Coutts felt a vague fear of
Winifred. She was intense and unnatural--and he became unnatural
and intense, beside her.</p>

<p>When he came downstairs she was fingering the piano from the
score of "Walk&uuml;re".</p>

<p>"First wash in England," he announced, looking at his hands.
She laughed swiftly. Impatient herself of the slightest soil, his
indifference to temporary grubbiness amused her.</p>

<p>He was a tall, bony man, with small hands and feet. His
features were rough and rather ugly, but his smile was taking.
She was always fascinated by the changes in him. His eyes,
particularly, seemed quite different at times; sometimes hard,
insolent, blue; sometimes dark, full of warmth and tenderness;
sometimes flaring like an animal's.</p>

<p>He sank wearily into a chair.</p>

<p>"My chair," he said, as if to himself.</p>

<p>She bowed her head. Of compact physique, uncorseted, her
figure bowed richly to the piano. He watched the shallow concave
between her shoulders, marvelling at its rich solidity. She let
one arm fall loose, he looked at the shadows in the dimples of
her elbow. Slowly smiling a look of brooding affection, of
acknowledgment upon him for a forgetful moment, she said:</p>

<p>"And what have you done lately?"</p>

<p>"Simply nothing," he replied quietly. "For all that these
months have been so full of variety, I think they will sink out
of my life; they will evaporate and leave no result; I shall
forget them."</p>

<p>Her blue eyes were dark and heavy upon him, watching. She did
not answer. He smiled faintly at her.</p>

<p>"And you?" he said, at length.</p>

<p>"With me it is different," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"You sit with your crystal," he laughed.</p>

<p>"While you tilt . . ." She hung on her ending.</p>

<p>He laughed, sighed, and they were quiet awhile.</p>

<p>"I've got such a skinful of heavy visions, they come sweating
through my dreams," he said.</p>

<p>"Whom have you read?" She smiled.</p>

<p>"Meredith. Very healthy," he laughed.</p>

<p>She laughed quickly at being caught.</p>

<p>"Now, have you found out all you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she cried with full throat.</p>

<p>"Well, finish, at any rate. I'm not diseased. How are
you?"</p>

<p>"But . . . but . . ." she stumbled on doggedly. "What
<i>do</i> you intend to do?"</p>

<p>He hardened the line of his mouth and eyes, only to retort
with immediate lightness:</p>

<p>"Just go on."</p>

<p>This was their battlefield: she could not understand how he
could marry: it seemed almost monstrous to her; she fought
against his marriage. She looked up at him, witch-like, from
under bent brows. Her eyes were dark blue and heavy. He shivered,
shrank with pain. She was so cruel to that other, common,
everyday part of him.</p>

<p>"I wonder you dare go on like it," she said.</p>

<p>"Why dare?" he replied. "What's the odds?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered, in deep, bitter displeasure.</p>

<p>"And I don't care," he said.</p>

<p>"But . . ." she continued, slowly, gravely pressing the point:
"You know what you intend to do."</p>

<p>"Marry--settle--be a good husband, good father, partner in the
business; get fat, be an amiable gentleman--Q.E.F."</p>

<p>"Very good," she said, deep and final.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"I did not congratulate you," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" His voice tailed off into sadness and self-mistrust.
Meanwhile she watched him heavily. He did not mind being
scrutinised: it flattered him.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, or may be, very good," she began; "but <i>why</i>
all this?--<i>why</i>?"</p>

<p>"And why not? And why?--Because I want to."</p>

<p>He could not leave it thus flippantly.</p>

<p>"You know, Winifred, we should only drive each other into
insanity, you and I: become abnormal."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "and even so, why the other?"</p>

<p>"My marriage?--I don't know. Instinct."</p>

<p>"One has so many instincts," she laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>That was a new idea to him.</p>

<p>She raised her arms, stretched them above her head, in a weary
gesture. They were fine, strong arms. They reminded Coutts of
Euripides' "Bacchae": white, round arms, long arms. The lifting
of her arms lifted her breasts. She dropped suddenly as if inert,
lolling her arms against the cushions.</p>

<p>"I really don't see why you should be," she said drearily,
though always with a touch of a sneer, "why we should always--be
fighting."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do," he replied. It was a deadlock which he
could not sustain.</p>

<p>"Besides," he laughed, "it's your fault."</p>

<p>"Am I <i>so</i> bad?" she sneered.</p>

<p>"Worse," he said.</p>

<p>"But"--she moved irritably--"is this to the point?"</p>

<p>"What point?" he answered; then, smiling: "You know you only
like a wild-goose chase."</p>

<p>"I do," she answered plaintively. "I miss you very much. You
snatch things from the Kobolds for me."</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said in a biting tone. "Exactly! That's what you
want me for. I am to be your crystal, your 'genius'. My length of
blood and bone you don't care a rap for. Ah, yes, you like me for
a crystal-glass, to see things in: to hold up to the light. I'm a
blessed Lady-of-Shalott looking-glass for you."</p>

<p>"You talk to <i>me</i>," she said, dashing his fervour, "of my
fog of symbols!"</p>

<p>"Ah, well, if so, 'tis your own asking."</p>

<p>"I did not know it." She looked at him coldly. She was
angry.</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>Again, they hated each other.</p>

<p>"The old ancients," he laughed, "gave the gods the suet and
intestines: at least, I believe so. They ate the rest. You
shouldn't be a goddess."</p>

<p>"I wonder, among your rectory acquaintances, you haven't
learned better manners," she answered in cold contempt. He closed
his eyes, lying back in his chair, his legs sprawled towards
her.</p>

<p>"I suppose we're civilised savages," he said sadly. All was
silent. At last, opening his eyes again, he said: "I shall have
to be going directly, Winifred; it is past eleven . . ." Then the
appeal in his voice changed to laughter. "Though I know I shall
be winding through all the <i>Addios</i> in 'Traviata' before you
can set me travelling." He smiled gently at her, then closed his
eyes once more, conscious of deep, but vague, suffering. She lay
in her chair, her face averted, rosily, towards the fire. Without
glancing at her he was aware of the white approach of her throat
towards her breast. He seemed to perceive her with another,
unknown sense that acted all over his body. She lay perfectly
still and warm in the fire-glow. He was dimly aware that he
suffered.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said at length; "if we were linked together we
should only destroy each other."</p>

<p>He started, hearing her admit, for the first time, this point
of which he was so sure.</p>

<p>"You should never <i>marry</i> anyone," he said.</p>

<p>"And you," she asked in irony, "must offer your head to
harness and be bridled and driven?"</p>

<p>"There's the makings of quite a good, respectable trotter in
me," he laughed. "Don't you see it's what I <i>want</i> to
be?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," she laughed in return.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>They were silent for a time. The white lamp burned steadily as
moonlight, the red fire like sunset; there was no stir or
flicker.</p>

<p>"And what of you?" he asked.</p>

<p>She crooned a faint, tired laugh.</p>

<p>"If you are jetsam, as you say you are," she answered, "I am
flotsam. I shall lie stranded."</p>

<p>"Nay," he pleaded. "When were you wrecked?"</p>

<p>She laughed quickly, with a sound like a tinkle of tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Winifred!" he cried despairingly.</p>

<p>She lifted her arms towards him, hiding her face between them,
looking up through the white closure with dark, uncanny eyes,
like an invocation. His breast lifted towards her uptilted arms.
He shuddered, shut his eyes, held himself rigid. He heard her
drop her arms heavily.</p>

<p>"I must go," he said in a dull voice.</p>

<p>The rapidly-chasing quivers that ran in tremors down the front
of his body and limbs made him stretch himself, stretch hard.</p>

<p>"Yes," she assented gravely; "you must go."</p>

<p>He turned to her. Again looking up darkly, from under her
lowered brows, she lifted her hands like small white orchids
towards him. Without knowing, he gripped her wrists with a grasp
that circled his blood-red nails with white rims.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said, looking down at her. She made a small,
moaning noise in her throat, lifting her face so that it came
open and near to him like a suddenly-risen flower, borne on a
strong white stalk. She seemed to extend, to fill the world, to
become atmosphere and all. He did not know what he was doing. He
was bending forward, his mouth on hers, her arms round his neck,
and his own hands, still fastened on to her wrists, almost
bursting the blood under his nails with the intensity of their
grip. They remained for a few moments thus, rigid. Then, weary of
the strain, she relaxed. She turned her face, offered him her
throat, white, hard, and rich, below the ear. Stooping still
lower, so that he quivered in every fibre at the strain, he laid
his mouth to the kiss. In the intense silence, he heard the deep,
dull pulsing of her blood, and a minute click of a spark within
the lamp.</p>

<p>Then he drew her from the chair up to him. She came, arms
always round his neck, till at last she lay along his breast as
he stood, feet planted wide, clasping her tight, his mouth on her
neck. She turned suddenly to meet his full, red mouth in a kiss.
He felt his moustache prick back into his lips. It was the first
kiss she had genuinely given. Dazed, he was conscious of the
throb of one great pulse, as if his whole body were a heart that
contracted in throbs. He felt, with an intolerable ache, as if
he, the heart, were setting the pulse in her, in the very night,
so that everything beat from the throb of his overstrained,
bursting body.</p>

<p>The hurt became so great it brought him out of the reeling
stage to distinct consciousness. She clipped her lips, drew them
away, leaving him her throat. Already she had had enough. He
opened his eyes as he bent with his mouth on her neck, and was
startled; there stood the objects of the room, stark; there,
close below his eyes, were the half-sunk lashes of the woman,
swooning on her unnatural ebb of passion. He saw her thus, knew
that she wanted no more of him than that kiss. And the heavy form
of this woman hung upon him. His whole body ached like a swollen
vein, with heavy intensity, while his heart grew dead with misery
and despair. This woman gave him anguish and a cutting-short like
death; to the other woman he was false. As he shivered with
suffering, he opened his eyes again, and caught sight of the pure
ivory of the lamp. His heart flashed with rage.</p>

<p>A sudden involuntary blow of his foot, and he sent the
lamp-stand spinning. The lamp leaped off, fell with a smash on
the fair, polished floor. Instantly a bluish hedge of flame
quivered, leaped up before them. She had lightened her hold round
his neck, and buried her face against his throat. The flame
veered at her, blue, with a yellow tongue that licked her dress
and her arm. Convulsive, she clutched him, almost strangled him,
though she made no sound.</p>

<p>He gathered her up and bore her heavily out of the room.
Slipping from her clasp, he brought his arms down her form,
crushing the starting blaze of her dress. His face was singed.
Staring at her, he could scarcely see her.</p>

<p>"I am not hurt," she cried. "But you?"</p>

<p>The housekeeper was coming; the flames were sinking and waving
up in the drawing-room. He broke away from Winifred, threw one of
the great woollen rugs on to the flame, then stood a moment
looking at the darkness.</p>

<p>Winifred caught at him as he passed her.</p>

<p>"No, no," he answered, as he fumbled for the latch. "I'm not
hurt. Clumsy fool I am--clumsy fool!"</p>

<p>In another instant he was gone, running with burning-red hands
held out blindly, down the street.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="s14">THINGS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>They were true idealists, from New England. But that is some
time ago: before the War. Several years before the War they met
and married; he a tall, keen-eyed young man from Connecticut, she
a smallish, demure, Puritan-looking young woman from
Massachusetts. They both had a little money. Not much, however.
Even added together it didn't make three thousand dollars a year.
Still--they were free. Free!</p>

<p>Ah!--freedom! To be free to live one's own life! To be
twenty-five and twenty-seven, a pair of true idealists with a
mutual love of beauty and an inclination towards "Indian
thought"--meaning, alas! Mrs Besant--and an income a little under
three thousand dollars a year! But what is money? All one wishes
to do is to live a full and beautiful life. In Europe, of course,
right at the fountain-head of tradition. It might possibly be
done in America: in New England, for example. But at forfeiture
of a certain amount of "beauty". True beauty takes a long time to
mature. The baroque is only half-beautiful, half-matured. No, the
real silver bloom, the real golden-sweet bouquet of beauty, had
its roots in the Renaissance, not in any later or shallower
period.</p>

<p>Therefore, the two idealists, who were married in New Haven,
sailed at once to Paris: Paris of the old days. They had a studio
apartment on the Boulevard Montparnasse, and they became real
Parisians, in the old, delightful sense, not in the modern,
vulgar. It was the shimmer of the pure impressionists, Monet and
his followers, the world seen in terms of pure light, light
broken and unbroken. How lovely! How lovely! how lovely the
nights, the river, the mornings in the old streets and by the
flower-stalls and the book-stalls, the afternoons up on
Montmartre or in the Tuileries, the evenings on the
boulevards!</p>

<p>They both painted, but not desperately. Art had not taken them
by the throat, and they did not take Art by the throat. They
painted: that's all. They knew people--nice people, if possible,
though one had to take them mixed. And they were happy.</p>

<p>Yet it seems as if human beings must set their claws in
<i>something.</i> To be "free", to be "living a full and
beautiful life", you must, alas! be attached to something. A
"full and beautiful life" means a tight attachment to
<i>something</i>--at least, it is so for all idealists--or else a
certain boredom supervenes; there is a certain waving of loose
ends upon the air, like the waving, yearning tendrils of the vine
that spread and rotate, seeking something to clutch, something up
which to climb towards the necessary sun. Finding nothing, the
vine can only trail, half-fulfilled, upon the ground. Such is
freedom--a clutching of the right pole. And human beings are all
vines. But especially the idealist. He is a vine, and he needs to
clutch and climb. And he despises the man who is a mere
<i>potato,</i> or turnip, or lump of wood.</p>

<p>Our idealists were frightfully happy, but they were all the
time reaching out for something to cotton on to. At first, Paris
was enough. They explored Paris <i>thoroughly.</i> And they
learned French till they almost felt like French people, they
could speak it so glibly.</p>

<p>Still, you know, you never talk French with your <i>soul.</i>
It can't be done. And though it's very thrilling, at first,
talking in French to clever Frenchmen--they seem <i>so</i> much
cleverer than oneself--still, in the long run, it is not
satisfying. The endlessly clever <i>materialism</i> of the French
leaves you cold, in the end, gives a sense of barrenness and
incompatibility with true New England depth. So our two idealists
felt.</p>

<p>They turned away from France--but ever so gently. France had
disappointed them. "We've loved it, and we've got a great deal
out of it. But after a while, a considerable while--several
years, in fact--Paris leaves one feeling disappointed. It hasn't
quite got what one wants."</p>

<p>"But Paris isn't France."</p>

<p>"No, perhaps not. France is quite different from Paris. And
France is lovely--quite lovely. But <i>to us</i>, though we love
it, it doesn't say a great deal."</p>

<p>So, when the War came, the idealists moved to Italy. And they
loved Italy. They found it beautiful, and more poignant than
France. It seemed much nearer to the New England conception of
beauty: something pure, and full of sympathy, without the
<i>materialism</i> and the <i>cynicism</i> of the French. The two
idealists seemed to breathe their own true air in Italy.</p>

<p>And in Italy, much more than in Paris, they felt they could
thrill to the teachings of the Buddha. They entered the swelling
stream of modern Buddhistic emotion, and they read the books, and
they practised meditation, and they deliberately set themselves
to eliminate from their own souls greed, pain, and sorrow. They
did not realise--yet--that Buddha's very eagerness to free
himself from pain and sorrow is in itself a sort of greed. No,
they dreamed of a perfect world, from which all greed, and nearly
all pain, and a great deal of sorrow, were eliminated.</p>

<p>But America entered the War, so the two idealists had to help.
They did hospital work. And though their experience made them
realise more than ever that greed, pain, and sorrow <i>should</i>
be eliminated from the world, nevertheless, the Buddhism, or the
theosophy, didn't emerge very triumphant from the long crisis.
Somehow, somewhere, in some part of themselves, they felt that
greed, pain and sorrow would never be eliminated, because most
people don't care about eliminating them, and never will care.
Our idealists were far too Western to think of abandoning all the
world to damnation while they saved their two selves. They were
far too unselfish to sit tight under a bho-tree and reach Nirvana
in a mere couple.</p>

<p>It was more than that, though. They simply hadn't enough
<i>Sitzfleisch</i> to squat under a bho-tree and get to Nirvana
by contemplating anything, least of all their own navel. If the
whole wide world was not going to be saved, they, personally,
were not so very keen on being saved just by themselves. No, it
would be so lonesome. They were New Englanders, so it must be all
or nothing. Greed, pain and sorrow must either be eliminated
<i>from all the world</i>,or else what was the use of eliminating
them from oneself? No use at all! One was just a victim.</p>

<p>And so--although they still <i>loved</i> "Indian thought", and
felt very tender about it: well, to go back to our metaphor, the
pole up which the green and anxious vines had clambered so far
now proved dry-rotten. It snapped, and the vines came slowly
subsiding to earth again. There was no crack and crash. The vines
held themselves up by their own foliage, for a while. But they
subsided. The beanstalk of "Indian thought" had given way before
Jack had climbed off the tip of it to a further world.</p>

<p>They subsided with a slow rustle back to earth again. But they
made no outcry. They were again "disappointed". But they never
admitted it. "Indian thought" had let them down. But they never
complained. Even to one another they never said a word. But they
were disappointed, faintly but deeply disillusioned, and they
both knew it. But the knowledge was tacit.</p>

<p>And they still had so much in their lives. They still had
Italy--dear Italy. And they still had freedom, the priceless
treasure. And they still had so much "beauty". About the fullness
of their lives they were not quite so sure. They had one little
boy, whom they loved as parents should love their children, but
whom they wisely refrained from fastening upon, to build their
lives on him. No, no, they must live their own lives! They still
had strength of mind to know that.</p>

<p>But they were now no longer so very young. Twenty-five and
twenty-seven had become thirty-five and thirty-seven. And though
they had had a very wonderful time in Europe, and though they
still loved Italy--dear Italy!--yet: they were disappointed. They
had got a lot out of it: oh, a very great deal indeed! Still, it
hadn't given them quite, not <i>quite,</i> what they had
expected; Europe was lovely, but it was dead. Living in Europe,
you were living on the past. And Europeans, with all their
superficial charm, were not <i>really</i> charming. They were
materialistic, they had no real <i>soul.</i> They just did not
understand the inner urge of the spirit, because the inner urge
was dead in them; they were all survivals. There, that was the
truth about Europeans: they were survivals, with no more getting
ahead in them.</p>

<p>It was another bean-pole, another vine-support crumbled under
the green life of the vine. And very bitter it was, this time.
For up the old tree-trunk of Europe the green vine had been
clambering silently for more than ten years, ten hugely important
years, the years of real living. The two idealists had
<i>lived</i> in Europe, lived on Europe and on European life and
European things as vines in an everlasting vineyard.</p>

<p>They had made their home here: a home such as you could never
make in America. Their watchword had been "beauty". They had
rented, the last four years, the second floor of an old Palazzo
on the Arno, and here they had all their "things". And they
derived a profound satisfaction from their apartment: the lofty,
silent, ancient rooms with windows on the river, with glistening,
dark-red floors, and the beautiful furniture that the idealists
had "picked up".</p>

<p>Yes, unknown to themselves, the lives of the idealists had
been running with a fierce swiftness horizontally, all the time.
They had become tense, fierce hunters of "things" for their home.
While their soul was climbing up to the sun of old European
culture or old Indian thought, their passions were running
horizontally, clutching at "things". Of course, they did not buy
the things for the things' sakes, but for the sake of "beauty".
They looked upon their home as a place entirely furnished by
loveliness, not by "things" at all. Valerie had some very lovely
curtains at the windows of the long <i>salotto,</i> looking on
the river: curtains of queer ancient material that looked like
finely knitted silk, most beautifully faded down from vermilion
and orange and gold and black, to a sheer soft glow. Valerie
hardly ever came into the <i>salotto</i> without mentally falling
on her knees before the curtains. "Chartres!" she said. "To me
they are Chartres!" And Melville never turned and looked at his
sixteenth-century Venetian book-case, with its two or three dozen
of choice books, without feeling his marrow stir in his bones.
The holy of holies!</p>

<p>The child silently, almost sinisterly, avoided any rude
contact with these ancient monuments of furniture, as if they had
been nests of sleeping cobras, or that "thing" most perilous to
the touch--the Ark of the Covenant. His childish awe was silent,
and cold, but final.</p>

<p>Still, a couple of New England idealists cannot live merely on
the bygone glory of their furniture. At least, one couple could
not. They got used to the marvellous Bologna cupboard, they got
used to the wonderful Venetian book-case, and the books, and the
Siena curtains and bronzes, and the lovely sofas and side-tables
and chairs they had "picked up" in Paris. Oh, they had been
picking things up since the first day they landed in Europe. And
they were still at it. It is the last interest Europe can offer
to an outsider: or to an insider either.</p>

<p>When people came, and were thrilled by the Melville interior,
then Valerie and Erasmus felt they had not lived in vain: that
they still were living. But in the long mornings, when Erasmus
was desultorily working at Renaissance Florentine literature, and
Valerie was attending to the apartment; and in the long hours
after lunch; and in the long, usually very cold and oppressive
evenings in the ancient palazzo: then the halo died from around
the furniture, and the things became things, lumps of matter that
just stood there or hung there, <i>ad infinitum,</i> and said
nothing; and Valerie and Erasmus almost hated them. The glow of
beauty, like every other glow, dies down unless it is fed. The
idealists still dearly loved their things. But they had got them.
And the sad fact is, things that glow vividly while you're
getting them go almost quite cold after a year or two. Unless, of
course, people envy you them very much, and the museums are
pining for them. And the Melvilles' "things", though very good,
were not quite as good as that.</p>

<p>So the glow gradually went out of everything, out of Europe,
out of Italy--"the Italians are <i>dears</i>"--even out of that
marvellous apartment on the Arno. "Why, if I had this apartment
I'd never, never even want to go out of doors! It's too lovely
and perfect." That was something, of course, to hear that.</p>

<p>And yet Valerie and Erasmus went out of doors; they even went
out to get away from its ancient, cold-floored, stone-heavy
silence and dead dignity. "We're living on the past, you know,
Dick," said Valerie to her husband. She called him Dick.</p>

<p>They were grimly hanging on. They did not like to give in.
They did not like to own up that they were through. For twelve
years, now, they had been "free" people, living a "full and
beautiful life". And America for twelve years had been their
anathema, the Sodom and Gomorrah of industrial materialism.</p>

<p>It wasn't easy to own that you were "through". They hated to
admit that they wanted to go back. But at last, reluctantly, they
decided to go, "for the boy's sake". "We can't <i>bear</i> to
leave Europe. But Peter is an American, so he had better look at
America while he's young." The Melvilles had an entirely English
accent and manner--almost--a little Italian and French here and
there.</p>

<p>They left Europe behind, but they took as much of it along
with them as possible. Several van-loads, as a matter of fact.
All those adorable and irreplaceable "things". And all arrived in
New York, idealists, child, and the huge bulk of Europe they had
lugged along.</p>

<p>Valerie had dreamed of a pleasant apartment, perhaps on
Riverside Drive, where it was not so expensive as east of Fifth
Avenue, and where all their wonderful things would look
marvellous. She and Erasmus house-hunted. But, alas! their income
was quite under three thousand dollars a year. They found--well,
everybody knows what they found. Two small rooms and a
kitchenette, and don't let us unpack a <i>thing</i>!</p>

<p>The chunk of Europe which they had bitten off went into a
warehouse, at fifty dollars a month. And they sat in two small
rooms and a kitchenette, and wondered why they'd done it.</p>

<p>Erasmus, of course, ought to get a job. This was what was
written on the wall, and what they both pretended not to see. But
it had been the strange, vague threat that the Statue of Liberty
had always held over them: "Thou shalt get a job!" Erasmus had
the tickets, as they say. A scholastic career was still possible
for him. He had taken his exams, brilliantly at Yale, and had
kept up his "researches" all the time he had been in Europe.</p>

<p>But both he and Valerie shuddered. A scholastic career! The
scholastic world! The <i>American</i> scholastic world! Shudder
upon shudder! Give up their freedom, their full and beautiful
life? Never! Never! Erasmus would be forty next birthday.</p>

<p>The "things" remained in warehouse. Valerie went to look at
them. It cost her a dollar an hour, and horrid pangs. The
"things", poor things, looked a bit shabby and wretched in that
warehouse.</p>

<p>However, New York was not all America. There was the great
clean West. So the Melvilles went West, with Peter, but without
the things. They tried living the simple life in the mountains.
But doing their own chores became almost a nightmare. "Things"
are all very well to look at, but it's awful handling them, even
when they're beautiful. To be the slave of hideous things, to
keep a stove going, cook meals, wash dishes, carry water, and
clean floors: pure horror of sordid anti-life!</p>

<p>In the cabin on the mountains Valerie dreamed of Florence, the
lost apartment; and her Bologna cupboard and Louis Quinze chairs,
above all, her "Chartres" curtains, stored in New York--and
costing fifty dollars a month.</p>

<p>A millionaire friend came to the rescue, offering them a
cottage on the Californian coast--California! Where the new soul
is to be born in man. With joy the idealists moved a little
farther west, catching at new vine-props of hope.</p>

<p>And finding them straws! The millionaire cottage was perfectly
equipped. It was perhaps as labour-savingly perfect as is
possible: electric heating and cooking, a
white-and-pearl-enamelled kitchen, nothing to make dirt except
the human being himself. In an hour or so the idealists had got
through their chores. They were "free"--free to hear the great
Pacific pounding the coast, and to feel a new soul filling their
bodies.</p>

<p>Alas! the Pacific pounded the coast with hideous brutality,
brute force itself! And the new soul, instead of sweetly stealing
into their bodies, seemed only meanly to gnaw the old soul out of
their bodies. To feel you are under the fist of the most blind
and crunching brute force: to feel that your cherished idealist's
soul is being gnawed out of you, and only irritation left in
place of it: well, it isn't good enough.</p>

<p>After about nine months the idealists departed from the
Californian west. It had been a great experience; they were glad
to have had it. But, in the long run, the West was not the place
for them, and they knew it. No, the people who wanted new souls
had better get them. They, Valerie and Erasmus Melville, would
like to develop the old soul a little further. Anyway, they had
not felt any influx of new soul on the Californian coast. On the
contrary.</p>

<p>So, with a slight hole in their material capital, they
returned to Massachusetts and paid a visit to Valerie's parents,
taking the boy along. The grandparents welcomed the child--poor
expatriated boy--and were rather cold to Valerie, but really cold
to Erasmus. Valerie's mother definitely said to Valerie one day
that Erasmus ought to take a job, so that Valerie could live
decently. Valerie haughtily reminded her mother of the beautiful
apartment on the Arno, and the "wonderful" things in store in New
York, and of the "marvellous and satisfying life" she and Erasmus
had led. Valerie's mother said that she didn't think her
daughter's life looked so very marvellous at present: homeless,
with a husband idle at the age of forty, a child to educate, and
a dwindling capital, looked the reverse of marvellous to
<i>her.</i> Let Erasmus take some post in one of the
universities.</p>

<p>"What post? What university?" interrupted Valerie.</p>

<p>"That could be found, considering your father's connections
and Erasmus's qualifications," replied Valerie's mother. "And you
could get all your valuable things out of store, and have a
really lovely home, which everybody in America would be proud to
visit. As it is, your furniture is eating up your income, and you
are living like rats in a hole, with nowhere to go to."</p>

<p>This was very true. Valerie was beginning to pine for a home,
with her "things". Of course, she could have sold her furniture
for a substantial sum. But nothing would have induced her to.
Whatever else passed away--religions, cultures, continents, and
hopes--Valerie would <i>never</i> part from the "things" which
she and Erasmus had collected with such passion. To these she was
nailed.</p>

<p>But she and Erasmus still would not give up that freedom, that
full and beautiful life they had so believed in. Erasmus cursed
America. He did not <i>want</i> to earn a living. He panted for
Europe.</p>

<p>Leaving the boy in charge of Valerie's parents, the two
idealists once more set off for Europe. In New York they paid two
dollars and looked for a brief, bitter hour at their "things".
They sailed "student class"--that is, third. Their income now was
less than two thousand dollars, instead of three. And they made
straight for Paris--cheap Paris.</p>

<p>They found Europe, this time, a complete failure. "We have
returned like dogs to our vomit," said Erasmus; "but the vomit
has staled in the meantime." He found he couldn't stand Europe.
It irritated every nerve in his body. He hated America, too. But
America at least was a darn sight better than this miserable,
dirt-eating continent; which was by no means cheap any more,
either.</p>

<p>Valerie, with her heart on her things--she had really burned
to get them out of that warehouse, where they had stood now for
three years, eating up two thousand dollars--wrote to her mother
she thought Erasmus would come back if he could get some suitable
work in America. Erasmus, in a state of frustration bordering on
rage and insanity, just went round Italy in a poverty-stricken
fashion, his coat-cuffs frayed, hating everything with intensity.
And when a post was found for him in Cleveland University, to
teach French, Italian, and Spanish literature, his eyes grew more
beady, and his long, queer face grew sharper and more rat-like
with utter baffled fury. He was forty, and the job was upon
him.</p>

<p>"I think you'd better accept, dear. You don't care for Europe
any longer. As you say, it's dead and finished. They offer us a
house on the College lot, and mother says there's room in it for
all our things. I think we'd better cable 'Accept'."</p>

<p>He glowered at her like a cornered rat. One almost expected to
see rat's whiskers twitching at the sides of the sharp nose.</p>

<p>"Shall I send the cablegram?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Send it!" he blurted.</p>

<p>And she went out and sent it.</p>

<p>He was a changed man, quieter, much less irritable. A load was
off him. He was inside the cage.</p>

<p>But when he looked at the furnaces of Cleveland, vast and like
the greatest of black forests, with red- and white-hot cascades
of gushing metal, and tiny gnomes of men, and terrific noises,
gigantic, he said to Valerie:</p>

<p>"Say what you like, Valerie, this is the biggest thing the
modern world has to show."</p>

<p>And when they were in their up-to-date little house on the
college lot of Cleveland University, and that woe-begone
d&eacute;bris of Europe--Bologna cupboard, Venice book-shelves,
Ravenna bishop's chair, Louis Quinze side-tables, "Chartres"
curtains, Siena bronze lamps--all were arrayed, and all looked
perfectly out of keeping, and therefore very impressive; and when
the idealists had had a bunch of gaping people in, and Erasmus
had showed off in his best European manner, but still quite
cordial and American, and Valerie had been most ladylike, but for
all that "we prefer America"; then Erasmus said, looking at her
with the queer sharp eyes of a rat:--</p>

<p>"Europe's the mayonnaise all right, but America supplies the
good old lobster--what?"</p>

<p>"Every time!" she said, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>And he peered at her. He was in the cage: but it was safe
inside. And she, evidently, was her real self at last. She had
got the goods. Yet round his nose was a queer, evil, scholastic
look, of pure scepticism. But he liked lobster.</p>
