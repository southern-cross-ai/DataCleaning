<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>West Australian
Orchids</b></font>
</p>

<p>Orchids are usually termed the aristocrats of plant life. The
presence of over 130 species in Western Australia adds considerable
interest to the study of her magnificent and world-famous
flora.</p>

<p>The order or family <i>Orchidaceae</i> was originally defined by
Haller in the 18th Century, its name being adapted from the root of
Orchis, a well-known genus in the temperate regions of the Northern
hemisphere. It belongs to the group of plants known as
monocotyledons, which have seeds generating in a single lobe, and
with few exceptions, parallel-veined leaves. The <i>Orchidaceae</i>
family is a very large one, represented in the world by over 400
genera and many thousands of species, especially abundant in the
Tropics, and rare in the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>West Australian orchids, which are practically all terrestrial,
cannot be compared to some found in Brazil, the Malay States,
India, and other tropical places, for size, vividness of colour,
and bizarre marking. But their delicate tints, dainty fragility of
form, the curious structure of many of the species, and their
methods of fertilisation, constitute beauty that endears them to
young and old, and characteristics that fascinate the botanist.</p>

<p>A tropical South American orchid (<i>Coryanthes, Hooker,</i>
four species) has the honour of being considered the most wonderful
flower in the world, It is an epiphyte (which means that it grows
attached to the trunk or branches of a tree without being
parasitical, or on a rock-face, but never in the ground) and has
pendulous flowers marvellously constructed for the purpose of
ensuring fertilisation by insects. Below a part composed of
succulent tissue very attractive to bees, is a bucket-like organ
kept full of a thin watery fluid that drips into it. The bees fight
for places to secure the succulent tissue, and every now and then
one falls, or gets pushed off, into the bucket. It can neither fly
nor climb out and is forced to squeeze through a sort of narrow'
overflow pipe. In so doing it passes the stigma, fertilising it, if
any pollen is borne, and then, passing the anther, is loaded with a
fresh supp1y of pollen to be carried to other flowers.</p>

<p><a name="page2" id="page2">Page 2</a>
</p>

<p><i>Stanhopea, Frost</i>, another tropical American epiphyte also
has flowers of wonderful construction and large size, some being
eight inches in diameter. In one species (<i>S. tigrina,
Bateman</i>) a certain part, the only escape from a bucket trap
covered with juicy hairs is so slippery that fertilisation is
effected by bees sliding down it on to the column. These and other
magnificent tropical orchids grown under cultivation in Europe, are
illustrated in colour in a French book entitled "Les Orchidees," by
E. de Puydt.</p>

<p><i>Pteroslylis</i>, an Australian genus well represented in
Western Australia, was specially mentioned by Darwin on account of
the curious construction of its flowers and interesting methods of
fertilisation, in his book, "The Fertilisation of Orchids."</p>

<p><b>NAMING AND CLASSIFICATION</b>
</p>

<p>Orchids, like all other classified plants, have two names. The
first, usually of Greek derivation, denotes the genus to which it
belongs, and the second, generally a Latin word, the species. In
some cases personal names commemorating distinguished botanists and
others have been used, but the names, when translated, usually
indicate some characteristic of genus or the species. "Why not
simple English names?" is a question often asked that can be best
explained, perhaps, by mentioning the fact that science knows no
nationality. A great deal of West Australian botanical collection,
research classification, has been done by foreign enthusiasts. It
is a good thing the custom exists of using a common dead language
such as Greek or Latin, for purposes of scientific nomenclature.
Otherwise, we should indeed have been saddled with some puzzles in
connection with the naming of our native flowers.</p>

<p>The name written immediately after an orchid or other classified
flower, is that of the botanist who originally named it. It will be
noticed that the majority of West Australian orchids owe their
titles to Robert Brown, the "grand old man of Australian botany.
Originally an army surgeon, he was appointed by Sir Joseph Banks to
accompany Flinders, as naturalist, on his voyage of discovery to
Australia in "Investigator." Robert Brown was subsequently Keeper
Botany at the British Museum, and is honoured as the greatest
systematic botanist of all time. Several genera and many species of
orchids were named by Professor John Lindley, a celebrated English
botanist, many years a deeply interested, worker on Australian
plants.</p>

<p><a name="page3" id="page3">Page 3</a>
</p>

<p>Other famous botanists responsible for the naming of numerous
species were George Bentham, author of "Flora Australiensis," a
comprehensive work on Australian plants; Baron Ferdinand von
Mueller, botanical explorer and writer, for many years Government
Botanist of Victoria; and R. D. Fitzgerald, who wrote and
illustrated in colour a priceless work on Australian orchids. Mr.
Fitzgerald died, unfortunately, before his task was finished. A
large number of his unpublished drawings are stored at the Mitchell
Library, Sydney, New South Wales. Apart from the beautiful
full-page plates, lucid descriptions and field notes of the
varieties dealt with in the two volumes of "Fitzgerald's Australian
Orchids," fascinating facts and theories concerning their
fertilisation are included.</p>

<p>Dr. R. S. Rogers, of Adelaide, South Australia, is the
present-day authority on Australian orchids. Besides describing
many new West Australian species, Dr. Rogers has contributed much
valuable information, based on personal knowledge of the living
plants, through the medium of various botanical publications,
dealing with other West Australian orchids, both well-known and
rarely collected.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edith Coleman, of Blackburn, Victoria, has made special
study of West Australian orchids, and enjoys the honour of being
the only woman to describe and name new orchid species in Western
Australia. Mrs. Coleman has contributed valuable addition to the
known facts concerning the pollination of various species. Mr. O.
H. Sargent, of Perth, also has specialised in orchid observation,
and defined and named many species.</p>

<p>The common names by which many orchids are known are extremely
interesting, but by no means satisfactory for identification
purposes. The same name is often applied to several species, and in
various places the same orchid is known by different names, which
is confusing. The correct botanical names of most West Australian
orchids are euphonious, and not too difficult for even children to
learn. Once the meanings are understood and the described
characteristics have been observed in the growing plants, the
terrors of the names vanish, and their usage becomes a matter of
course.</p>

<p><a name="page4" id="page4">Page 4</a>
</p>

<p>The following rules have been laid down for the correct spelling
of botanical names: Generic names should always begin with a
capital letter. A capital letter should be used for the name of a
species derived from the name of a person. The termination "ii" is
used with personal names (masculine) after all consonants except
"r," e.g., <i>Menziesii, Muelleri;</i> but not after vowels, e.g.,
<i>Purdiei.</i> The gender of an adjective species should agree
with that of the generic name.</p>

<p>No absolutely authoritative ruling can be quoted for the proper
pronunciation of the generic names of the various orchids, and it
is surprising how many different ways some of them can be, and are
pronounced. In hope of something definite in this respect being
adopted by West Australia orchid-lovers, the pronunciations
commonly used by botanist are indicated in this book.</p>

<p>Classification of West Australian orchids, so far as genus is
concerned, is not usually difficult. With a little practice correct
identification of the different species becomes easy if a book of
reference is available, although examination of specimens under a
lens is sometimes necessary. Pictures and detailed drawings are
helpful, but to "run out," as botanist term working from detailed
descriptions, is the most unsatisfactory way of arriving definitely
at right identification. With the aid of this book it should not be
beyond the power of any person or child of reasonable age,
sufficiently interested, to learn to run out both genus and species
of any West Australian orchid for themselves. The use of difficult
technical terms has been avoided as much as possible. A glossary,
however, is appended which explains the meaning of certain word
considered necessary for concise and clear description. Idea can be
obtained from the illustrations as to the genus of a specimen. If
that genus be turned up and the general description found to agree,
the details of the various species can be glanced through until one
is discovered that corresponds in shape and colour, size of leaf,
parts of flower, etc. To cormpare the descriptions of well-known
varieties with living specimens is good practice for learning to
deal with orchids not so well known.</p>

<p><a name="page5" id="page5">Page 5</a>
</p>

<p><b>STRUCTURE, FERTILISATION and REPRODUCTION</b>
</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of an orchid flower is the column,
composed of the united male and female generative organs, stamens
and pistil, and bearing upon it a small button-like projection
known as the rostellum, covered, like the stigma, with a sticky
glue like substance attractive to insects.</p>

<p>Orchids are fertilised by pollen-grains falling from the anther
on to the stigma, or being deposited upon it by pollen bearing
insects visiting the flower. Should the rostellum be touched by an
insect (or even for purposes of experiment with a pin) the pollen
masses are released from the anther at the top of the column. The
column often bears wing-like, semi-transparent appendages that
assist in the direction of insects to the rostellum.</p>

<p>At the base of the column is the ovary or seed capsule. The
perianth consists of three sepals, forming the outer row, and three
petals alternate with them, forming the inner row, all adherent to
the ovary. The sepals are usually darker outside than the petals. A
distinctive feature of an orchid flower is that the third petal or
labellum (commonly called the lip) is usually unlike the others,
and of strange and unexpected shape. In many cases the lip has a
part to play in assisting fertilisation by insects. Its appearance
attracts them. The rows of calli or glandular hairs upon it in some
species, guide crawling insects to the base of the column. When the
lip is fringed, insects often get entangled, and their struggles
for freedom generally result in pollen being deposited upon the
stigma. In some instances the lip springs forward at the lightest
touch, being provided with a hinge-like contrivance, so that
insects alighting on the lip are forced against the column and held
there.</p>

<p>Some orchids, owing to the arrangement of the generative parts,
are capable of self-pollination, but, the majority are dependent
upon insects for fertilisation, the pollen usually being carried
from other flowers. Those species that are selffertilised always
produce a far greater proportion of seed.</p>

<p>The seed-capsule of an orchid is three-celled, each cell
containing a great number of tiny seeds. The quantity produced is
counterbalanced by the fact that the seeds do not germinate freely,
and the enormous number of flowers on varieties dependent on
insects for reproduction, that bloom and wither without being
fertilised.</p>

<p>Although orchids seed freely when fertilised, the reproduction
of terrestrial species is largely carried on by multiplication of
the root tubers, and for this reason an orchid plant should never
be torn heedlessly from the ground. If the flower is carefully
picked from above, or even just below the lower leaf or leaves, no
damage is done and it will grow up again.</p>

<p><a name="page6" id="page6">Page 6</a>
</p>

<p><b>COLLECTION OF ORCHIDS</b>
</p>

<p>The study of orchids should appeal to any lover of Nature's
beauty and wonders, and is one to be encouraged. Orchid-hunting is
a delightful pastime entailing much healthful walking exercise, and
adding unending charm to bush excursions. The interest of the
beginner who has acquired some knowledge of species and habits,
rapidly becomes the enthusiasm of the keen collector. And there is
no doubt that the pursuit of Nature-study once cultivated by those
lucky bush-dwellers with opportunity at their door-step, does much
to relieve the monotony of country life.</p>

<p>"Live and let live," however, should be the motto of those
orchid-seekers who strive to pick every flower on sight-a practice
that can have but one result, the gradual but sure extermination of
even the commonest kinds. Most children, and grown-ups also, have
much to learn in this respect. Just a few carefully selected
specimens in a loose bunch are ever so much more effective than
hundreds of blooms tightly packed into a great mass than can
scarcely be held in the hand. Orchids picked in this wholesale
fashion usually are thrown away almost as soon as gathered or upon
reaching home, because of their pitiable crushed and wilted
condition, or the impossibility of using such quantities for
decorative purpose in any one house. Quality and- variety, not
quantity, should be the aim of the orchid-hunter, also the
opportunity of noting the characteristics of different species.</p>

<p>Children love orchids. They see quaint resemblances to something
or other in almost every familiar variety. Perhaps because West
Australian orchids mostly are plants of lowly stature, and the eyes
of children are nearer the ground than those of grown-ups, boys and
girls usually have what is known as "the orchid eye" exceedingly
well developed, and are wonderfully quick at noticing species often
unobserved by the casual passer-by.</p>

<p><a name="page7" id="page7">Page 7</a>
</p>

<p>A carefully prepared and properly classified orchid collection
is of great interest. The specimens should be pressed by placing
them carefully between sheets of blotting-paper as flat as possible
and applying pressure with a hot iron. They should then be neatly
mounted on a piece of stout white paper - not stuck on, but held in
position by several narrow strips of adhesive paper - and labelled
with the correct botanical name, colour, the common name or names
by which known, locality where found, and the date. The various
species should be grouped together under the headings of their
respective genera, and the whole collection kept either in folders
made of thick paper, or mounted on heavy paper and the sheets bound
together by fine cord run through punched holes on the loose-leaf
system, so that fresh specimens may be put away in their proper
places as collected.</p>

<p>Systematic botanists are often compelled to rely solely upon
dried specimens of plants from different lands for purposes of
study and description. Bentham's monumental work, "Flora
Australiensis" affords a striking example from a classification
point of view of what can be attained without personal knowledge of
the flora of a country in its natural state. But no one interested,
and fortunate enough to live within reach of the living and growing
plants, should be content with such acquaintance with orchids. The
observation of the growth and development of the various species
from week to week, and year to year, is a fascinating hobby, Notes
carefully kept with comparisons of various individual plants of the
same variety growing under different conditions may yield valuable
unrecorded information. It is in this way, for in stance, that one
becomes acquainted with the great change in the whole form of the
plant which such a common orchid a <i>Pterosty1is vittata</i>
undergoes during the first three year of its growth. Many of the
orchids in Western Australia such as this one which grows readily
from seed, are easily cultivated in boxes or pots and under such
conditions can be studied at frequent intervals without difficulty.
(See <a href="#lypfor"><i>Lyperanthus Forrestii</i></a> and
<a href="#cryova"><i>Cryptostylis ovata</i></a>.)</p>

<p><b>WEST AUSTRALIAN TYPES</b>
</p>

<p>West Australian orchids, excepting those of the northern
tropical area, are all terrestrial; that is, they growr in the
ground. In the northern regions of Western Australia epiphytical
and other tropical orchids have been found. Specimens in the
Government herbariums from the Kimberley district, include
<i>Eulophia venosa, Reichenbach fil; Cymbidium canaliculatum,
R.</i> <i>Brown; and Dendrobium dicuphum, F. von Mueller</i>. The
humid atmosphere of the tropical area of Western Australia is more
favourable to the growth, of epiphytes than the temperate regions
of the southern portion of the State, where in the summer the
rainfall is slight, and the moisture necessary for tree orchids
dries out of the bark surrounding the trunks of forest trees. With
the exception of one species of Gastrodia and perhaps the recently
discovered <i>Rhizanthella</i>, all West Australian orchids belong
to the tribe <i>Neottieae,</i> in which the anther is erect or bent
forward and persistent. Species of genera (including
<i>Gastrodia</i>) belonging to the <i>Arethuseae</i> tribe have the
anther lid-like, incumbent, and usually deciduous.</p>

<p><a name="page8" id="page8">Page 8</a>
</p>

<p><b>LOCALITIES, ETC.</b>
</p>

<p>In the following pages descriptions will be found of the
terrestrial orchids native to Western Australia. Localities, with
month of flowering, have in almost every instance, been appended to
each detailed description. But attempt has not been made to define
exactly either the range, situation or flowering period of the
various species, as most of them widely distributed and
indifferent, apparently, to any particular class of soil. The
places and times given, however, serve as a guide for the
collection of specially desired species The majority of West
Australian orchids thrive equally in forest glades, river beds or
swampy places, in the vicinity of flooded flats, sandy soil or on
granite mountain range or coastal limestone hills. Flowering times
vary according situation, sometimes extending over several
months.</p>

<p>Many orchids may be found upon the slopes of, or on flats
adjacent to the Darling Range. Some varieties are fairly plentiful
in and around Perth and suburbs on vacant virgin land, and in the
vicinity of the upper reaches of Swan and Canning rivers.</p>

<p>Some of the most showy and beautiful of West Australian orchids
belong to this genus, represented by many species, commonly called
"Sun Orchids," with variously coloured flowers, often sweetly
scented, in a terminal raceme. The flowers, unlike the usual orchid
type, have, sepals and petals nearly equal in length, with the lip
similar to and spreading with them. This striking characteristic
occurs among Australian orchids only in this genus. Many
interesting experiments and observations were made and recorded by
R. D. Fitzgerald in regard to the fertilisation of the various
species of <i>Thelymitra</i> (some of which are capable of
self-fertilisation while others are wholly dependent on insects) by
artificial pollination with the aid of a pin, and the use of a
bell-glass placed over a plant in the early stages of its
development, thus precluding the possibility of insect
fertilisation, and proving in many cases, the presence of the power
of self-fertilisation. Various species produced seed when crossed
artificially among themselves, and with the various forms of
<i>Diuris.</i> The column is erect, rather short, and very broadly
winged. Where the anther rises above the stigma, and the pollen
masses crumble readily and fall on the stigma, the flower is
usually capable of self-fertilisation. Some species fertilise
themselves in the bud, the flower afterwards expanding. Where the
pollen masses are not easily broken and come away readily at a
touch, but whole, from behind or below the stigma, insects are
necessary for fertilisation. The various species have a solitary
leaf, usually with a long sheath.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Thelymitra</i> is principally Australian, but
extends to New Zealand, New Caledonia and Java.</p>

<p><b>T. ixioides, Swartz; flowers like Ixia.</b><br>

reference in either of the original descriptions." (Transactions
Royal Society of S.A., Vol. LIV., 1930). Dr. Rogers adds that
Bentham retained only <i>T. variegata</i>, expressing doubt as to
the wisdom of uniting these species, a point to be settled only
after examination of a plentiful supply of material.<br></p>

<p>An Australian genus known as "Double-tails." The best known
species in Western Australia is commonly called "Donkey Orchid."
Other species of the genus can easily be identified by their
resemblance to it in type of flower. Typical characteristics of the
genus are the narrow leaves, few at or near the base of the stem,
with a few sheathing bracts higher up, the curiously shaped
flowers-one, two, or several-in a terminal raceme, the upper sepal
short and broad, the two lower sepals narrow and curved, the two
upper petals battle-dore shaped, with the lip deeply three-lobed,
and total dependance on insects for fertilisation. Fitzgerald
observed that from the compact nature of the pollen masses and the
readiness with which they may be moved by the slightest touch of
the rostellum, they must be most frequently fertilised by the
pollen from other flowers. He noticed an affinity in stigma,
rostellum and anther, to <i>Thelymitra ixioides,</i> and produced
seed by crossings between this species and <i>Diuris</i>. Many
botanists disagree with Bentham's arrangement of the genus, and
consider that he has grouped species in some instances that should
have been kept distinct.</p>

of the column. Fertilisation is performed by insects, which, by
touching the very small and sensitive rostellum, cause the pollen
either to fall and adhere to the stigma, or be carried by them to
aother flower. Like <i>Prasophyllum,</i> species are considered

<b>[praise-o-fill-um ]</b><br>
From <i>prasos,</i> a leek, and <i>phyilos,</i> a leaf; referring
to the leek-like leaves.</p>

<p>Species of this genus are commonly called "Leek Orchids.' The
genus is easily recognised by the sheathing leaf and spike of small
inverted flowers, but many of the species are difficult to
determine. The spikes of whitish flowers tinged or streaked with
green and purple, are not specially attractive to the flower
hunter, yet the beauty of a single bloom when beheld through a
magnifying-glass is amazing. The sepals and petals are narrow and
inconspicuous. The lip on the upper side of the flower is broad and
slightly waved at the edge, often bearing an inner plate The column
is very short.</p>

<p>The various species of <i>Prasophyllum</i> are wholly dependent
on insects for fertilisation, and there is a marked difference in
the number fertilised according to situation. Sometimes solitary
plants will not have a single flower fertilised, yet when growing
in groups, generally in a rushy flat-perhaps the haunt of some
particular insect - every flower on every plant will be fertilised.
Hybridisation of different species is common and no doubt
responsible for specimens that have been collected bearing flowers
on the same spike having characteristics of species so different as
to have been placed by Bentham in separate sections dividing those
with a rigid sessile lip from others having the lip on a short
claw.</p>

The following translation from the German of Schlecter's
description (Fedde, XVII., 1921, pp.81) has been kindly supplied by
Dr. R. S. Rogers: "This plant has been incorrectly identified with
<i>D. elastica, Lindley,</i> from which it certainly differs
specifically. The leaves are more roundly ovate, and not so
distinctly reniform or circular; the stem is generally shorter. The
lateral sepals and petals are not directed downwards, but curved
forwards and backwards so that they cross one another. The labellum
is furnished with warty growths to beyond the middle, and
particularly in the middle and along the margins; anteriorly it is
distinctly turned upwards with an emarginate apex; the posterior
extension of the labellum, which in <i>D. elastica</i> is
distinctly narrowed in the lower part, is in this species plainly
elongate. Likewise the margins of column are more conspicuously
widened than in <i>D. elastica</i></p>

<b>[terro-style-iss]</b><br>
From <i>pteros,</i> a wing, and <i>stylos,</i> a style.</p>

<p>The largest and one of the most interesting genera among
Australian orchids, The various species are commonly called
"Greenhoods" because of the shape and colour of the flower usually
greenish, tinged or streaked with red or brown. The main part of
the hood (known botanically as the galea) is formed of the upper
sepal and the two lateral petals, lightly attached. The two lower
sepals are joined to form a kind of forked door to the front of the
hood. The lip usually is irritable, small and tongue like, with a
spur at its base, and is placed inside the joined lower sepals. The
long column concealed within the hood is winged hence the name
<i>Pterostylis</i><b>.</b></p>

<p><a name="page32" id="page32">Page 32</a>
</p>

<p>The genus includes nearly sixty known species, of which over 40
are Australian, and most of these are endemic. It extends to New
Zealand, New Caledonia and New Guinea. Species of
<i>Pterostylis,</i> owing to the curious formation of the flowers
and what one might term their "habits," are of particular interest
to botanists and scientists. The genus is mentioned by Darwin in
his book on the fertilisation of orchids, as follows:-</p>

<p>"The flap of the labellum is irritable and hangs out below the
hood. If an insect lands on it, it instantly moves and imprisons
the visitor against the column, and the only mode of escape is by
squeezing past the stigma. After half an hour the lip goes down
again and is ready for another capture."</p>

<p>This peculiarity is known to most children, who love to touch a
sensitive lip and watch its lightning upward spring. <i>P.
vittata,</i> commonly called "Cockatoo Orchid," a species common in
Western Australia, is a favourite for such demonstrations.
Fitzgerald's observations upon the genus and individual species,
recorded in his work on Australian orchids, are intensely
interesting, as are also the published notes of Dr. R. S.
Rogers.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald formed the opinion that, in spite of Nature's
marvellous schemes to ensure fertilisation of the various species
of. <i>Pterostylis,</i> they are seldom reproduced naturally by
seeds, and that the fact of their being found so frequently in
groups pointed to reproduction by tubers or leading roots, which
may be swept out of the ground by heavy rain-storms, rooted up by
animals or ants, and washed or blown away, to vegetate elsewhere.
It has been found, however, that many varieties of
<i>Pterostyli</i>s can be cultivated from seed, as well as by
transplantation, quite easily, and healthy plants in various stages
of development may be found nourishing in the greenhouses of many
orchid lovers.</p>

<p>In Mr. O. H. Sargent, Western Australia has an orchid enthusiast
who is not only an accomplished botanist, but a keen student of
Nature. From him we learn that the flowers of some species of
<i>Pterostylis</i> contain sticky juices that attract and
intoxicate visiting insects, thus compelling them to remain within
the flower long enough either to effect fertilisation there, or
make sure of pollen being attached to body or wings to be carried
on subsequently to another flower.</p>

<p>Two species of the genus in <i>P. barbata</i> and <i>P.
turfosa,</i> the latter endemic to Western Australia and known as
the "Bird orchid," supply a most striking illustration of that
characteristic so often quoted as one by which an orchid may be
easily recognised<br>
-the difference of the third petal or "lip" to the other two and
the sepals. No contrast could be greater than the long and slender
thread-like protruberance bearded with bristling hairs, to the
solid structure of the rest of the flower.</p>

striped, the edge of galea and lower sepals tinged with red. Galea
upright, over 1 in. long, with a long point, and much contracted in
the middle, thus forming two openings or doorways to the interior
of the flower, the lower ostensibly for the entry of insects, and
the upper one for their departure only, entry there being prevented
by an arrangement consisting of a barricade formed by the crossing
of the upper angles of the column wings, further safeguarded by two
hairs that are automatically released from the point of the galea
when the flower is ready for fertilisation, and cross each other in
front of the opening. This device, however, does not hinder the
egress of an insect visitor. Lower part of galea linear, with
spreading lobes ending in long points. Lip thread-like, bearded
with long lateral hairs, and having a clavate point. This orchid

<p>A large genus of hairy plants, with several species in New
Zealand, and between 60 and 70 endemic to Australia, and chiefly)
represented in Western Australia. <i>Caldenia</i> species are
readily distinguished by the rows of calli or glandular hairs upon
the lip Leaf solitary, linear-lanceolate or oblong. Flowers
solitary or very few in a loose raceme, variously coloured. Dorsal
sepal usually erect or incurved over the column, while the lateral
petals and the other two sepals are somewhat flat and spreading.
The length and shape of the petals and sepals vary considerably in
the different species which are divided into easily defined
sections. Species with long tapering sepals and petals are known as
"Spider Orchids," and greatly admired for their dainty, fragile
loveliness. Nature has been kind to Western Australia, as in
addition to the number of beautiful species of <i>Caladenia</i> she
possesses, most of them have been distributed with a lavish
hand.</p>

<p>Botanists have differed regarding the classification of some
species of <i>Caladenia</i> and closely allied genera, which have
been placed in various lists claiming to be authoritative, under
different names. This is confusing to beginners and necessitates
endless explanation.</p>

<p>After Western Australia, Victoria is the Australian State most
favoured with <i>Caladenias,</i> having 20 species, which, with the
exception of five (including <i>Caladenia Patersonii,</i> found in
all the States), are different to West Australian varieties. New
Zealand has several species of <i>Caladenia,</i> New South Wales
has 17, Queensland 5, South Australia 18, and Tasmania 12, and the
genus is represented in New Caledonia and the Malay Archipelago.
The Australian species are all endemic, with the exception of <i>C.

<b>W.A. Widely distributed and common. September - October.</b></p>

<p>Orchid-hunters acquainted only with Eastern States specimens of
<i>Caladenia Pattersonii,</i> invariably are amazed at the
development of this Western Australian variety. Stems are
frequently over 2 ft. 6 in. high. The outstretched tentacles (often
dilated again towards the end) sometimes measure 12 in. across, and
some plants bear as many as five perfect blossoms. It has been
pointed out by Dr. Rogers that natural hybridism is responsible for
a great deal of confusion with filamentous <i>Caladenias,</i> These
often are linked by intermediate forms and pass imperfectly from
one into the other.</p>

<p>An Australian genus of five species. Usually hairy plants. Leaf
solitary, oblong or lanceolate. Flowers one or two. Sepals and
petals obtuse, nearly equal, spreading. This genus is closely
allied to Caladenia, differing in the absence of calli on the
surface of he lip, but having at its base calli-like appendages,
distinct and large in West Australian species. It is divided into
two sections, which might easily be considered distinct genera-one,
peculiar to the Eastern States only, having one bifid (or cleft)
appendage the base of the column; the other, endemic to Western
Australia, with two basal appendages to the column.</p>

<p>West Australian species are known as "Enamel" "Wax" or "China

surface of the flowers which are heavily spotted on the under
side.</p>

<p>Dwarf plants with a single heart-shaped leaf, frosted in
appearance below. Flowers large in proportion to size of plants,
solitary, somewhat trumpet-mouthed. The lip is curiously fringed
with bristle-like auricles or spurs which no doubt assist in
snaring insects, for fertilisation purposes, that may visit the
flower in search of honey. Fitzgerald has recorded that "the
various species are capable of self-fertilisation aided by insects,
but seed is seldom produced and the plants multiply by their roots
and bulbs apparently. Individual plants, though several inches
apart, are often united, but only one plant so joined is ever found
in flower, and the connection probably lasts only one season." The
genus is extensive, ranging from the Philippines, the Himalayas,
through the islands to Papua, Polynesia, New Zealand and Australia.
There are five Australian species.</p>

<b>W.A.: Big Brook. Albany District. June - August.</b></p>

<p>A specimen of <i>Corysanthes</i> was found in June, 1921, at Big
Brook, near Pemberton, in the "karri" country, growing on the trunk
of "Blackboy" (<i>Xanthorrhoea Preissii</i>). It puzzled the
finder, who thought it might be an epiphyte and sent it to Mr. W.
Catton Grasby for identification. The collection of
<i>Corysanthes</i> has been but seldom recorded in Western
Australia, and this "find" was considered of particular interest,
reproduction from seed being proved, undoubtedly, because of the
situation. <i>C. fimbriata, R. Brown, <b>and</b> C. pruinosa,
Cunningham</i> are doubtfully distinct species, and frequently grow
intermingled in the Eastern States, where they are found
occasionally growing in abundance on the trunks of tree ferns. They
flower in winter and early spring. A description of <i>C.
fimbriata, R. Brown,</i> is appended: Plant small, leaf round,
cordate, pointed. Flower reddish-purple, almost sessile. Dorsal
sepal erect, then incurved, gradually contracted to a claw, lamina
forming a hood over and beyond the lip. Lateral sepals colourless,
linear, connate at their bases with each other and with the petals.
Petals somewhat wider and shorter, colourless, often bidentate. Lip
large, sessile, deep crimson, lower half vertical against the
dorsal sepal, enclosing the column in a split tube; upper part
acutely recurved, expanding into an orifice with denticulate
margins and directed forward. Tube at base dilated at each side of
attachment into a wide auricle. Column short, not winged.</p>

<p>The orifice of the lip of <i>C. pruinosa</i> is not fimbriate,
or scarcely so, usually having entire incurved margins.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Cryptostylis, R.
Brown</b></font><b>[krypt-o-style-iss]</b><br>
From <i>cryptos</i>, concealed, and <i>stylos</i>, a column.</p>

<p>A genus closely allied to <i>Calochilus</i> but without the
fringed lip. Flowers reversed, apparently wholly depend on insects
for pollination. There are 18 known species of <i>Cryptostylis</i>
these are endemic to Australia. The others are found in Formosa,
Malay, Papua, Philippines, New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa.</p>

<p><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>Page 62</p>

<p>Interesting observations concerning the pollination of the genus
have been made by Mrs. Edith Coleman, Mr. O. H. Sargent and
Lt.-Colonel B. T. Goadby. In a paper contributed to "The Victorian
Naturalist" (Vol. XLIV., May, 1927), Mrs. Coleman described the
visits of Ichneumon-flies (<i>Lissopimpla semipunctata, Kirby,</i>)
to <i>Cryptostylis leptochila</i> (an Eastern States species). It
was definitely established that this insect visits this particular
orchid purposely, enters the flowers backwards instead of in the
usual manner of nectar-seeking wasps, and successfully effects
pollination. The following is a quotation from Mrs. Coleman's
paper:</p>

<p>"After backing into the stigma, the end of the wasp's body took
an inward falcate curve, and the base of the flower's labellum
appeared to be gripped by the claspers. This curve of the end,
brought the abdomen just in position for the upper-surface, at
about the second last ring, to rest on the flower's prominent
rostellum, with its dark-coloured disk. The insect quivered for a
moment, and then became motion-less. After a second or two, it
freed itself, with an apparent effort which shook the flower,
Resistance could be plainly felt when we withdrew the insect with
our fingers. In every instance, when we gave it time enough, the
effort was sufficient to release the pollinia, which, with the
viscid disc, were carried off by the insect on the tip of its
abdomen, never on any other part of the body. Owing, no doubt, to
this resistance, pollen was frequently deposited on the stigma of
the same flower, and more was probably carried to the stigma of the
next flowers visited. Some of the insects bore pollen before they
entered our flowers, while others took away more than they brought.
It took at least a second to complete the act, and if we disturbed
the wasp too soon, no pollen was abstracted."</p>

<p>In an article published in "The Journal of Botany," April, 1929,
Mrs. Coleman states:</p>

<p>"Only males visit the orchids, in circumstances that leave no
room for doubt that they are stimulated by sex-instincts, and enter
the flowers under the misapprehension that these are females of
their kind. . .The shape and colour of the labellum suggest the
body of the female wasp, the glistening glands corresponding with
the brilliant white spots on the abdomen of the insect. The narrow
sepals and petals probably suggest the antennae, ovipositor, and
guides. . .The female wasp has never been seen near the orchids,
yet one may expose a few spikes in a locality where they are not
known to occur, and in a few minutes they are visited by the male
insect. . . . Apart from the resemblance of the flowers to the
female wasps it is fairly certain that their perfume though almost
imperceptible to us, is conveyed to the male wasps over quite long
distances..The case is not so singular as was at first supposed,
for observation of several other Australian orchids points clearly
to similar partnerships."</p>

<p><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>Page 63</p>

<p>In an accompanying note, Colonel M. J. Godfrey Comments upon
Mrs. Coleman's observations, as follows:</p>

<p>". . .Dr. R. S. Rogers, the leading authority on the Australian
<i>Orchidaceae</i>, has never seen a hybrid in the genus
<i>Cryptostylis</i>. In this respect it resembles the North African
<i>Ophrys specu1um,</i> which is solely visited by <i>Dielis
ciliata</i> (Journ. Bot., 1925, p.34). The removal of the pollinia
on the end of the insect's abdomen is exactly parallel with the
case of <i>Ophrys fusca</i> and <i>O. lutea,</i> in which the
species of <i>Andrena</i> concerned assume the same reversed
position. Some doubt has been expressed as to whether the
resemblance of the lip of the flower to the female
<i>Lissopimpla</i> is sufficient to deceive the male. It seems to
be agreed that the vision of insects is very inferior to ours. But
so long as one or two salient points are suggested, exact
resemblance to the insect concerned is unnecessary. The metallic
blue centre of the lip and its fringe of red hair in <i>Ophrys
speculum</i> are quite enough to convince the male Dielis ciliata
that he sees the sheen of blue wings and the red-fringed abdomen of
his long-looked-for mate. The shadowy and indefinite markings on
the lip of <i>O.fusc</i>a and <i>O.lutea</i> (which only suggest an
insect to us when viewed from a distance) are quite enough to
persuade an <i>Anrena</i> that he has found what he wants. In her
second paper in the "Victorian Naturalist," 1928, p.334, Mrs.
Coleman says: 'A glance at the strange labellum . . . . with its
double row of dark glistening glands that gleam in the hot
sunshine. . . . is perhaps sufficient to justify the theory of an
attraction based on the resemblance of the flower to a female wasp.
Even to our eyes the likeness is apparent. To the inferior eyesight
of the insect the resemblance may be still more convincing.'
Further, in all the above cases, insects are attracted to the
flowers from a distance, showing that by the emission of scent or
of some other attractive agency, the flowers are able to convey
knowledge of their existence. That the appeal is not to the desire
for food, but to the strong sexual urge of the male, was
sufficiently evident in the case of certain species of
<i>Ophrys,</i> and is confirmed in a remarkable manner by Mrs.
Coleman's discovery that the sexual claspers of the male actually
became engaged with the base of the labellum, so that resistance
can be felt when the insect is pulled away."</p>

<p><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>Page 64</p>

<p>In another paper ("The Victorian Naturalist," Vol. XLVI July,
1929), Mrs. Coleman described similar pollination methods by the
same insects on <i>Cryptostylis subulata</i> and <i>C. erecta</i>.
It was found that a faded specimen of the only West Australia
species of <i>Cryptostylis</i> <i>(C. ovata)</i> held a very great
attraction for the ichneumons, which hovered about it, and made
many attempts to enter the limp, travel-worn bloom. Mrs. Coleman's
theory is that the absence of hybrids where different species are
found growing intermingled may be due to the fact that anther and
stigma in various species mature at different periods, and that
pollen from one species is incapable of fertilising another. ("The
Victorian Naturalist," April, 1930.) Further experiments, however,
are being made by Mrs. Coleman.</p>

<p>Observations made by Colonel Goadby and Mr. O. H. Sargent prove
that cultivated plants of <i>Cryptostylis ovata</i> are fertilised
by the same fly in similar fashion, as recorded by an article
entitled "Wildflower Nuptials," by Mr. Sargent in "The West
Australian" on December 14, 1929, and in a paper by Mrs. Coleman in
"The Victorian Naturalist," February, 1930.</p>

<p><b>W.A.: Corrigin, Shackleton, Goomaling. May - June.</b>
</p>

<p>The discovery of this orchid at Corrigin by Mr. John Trott when
cultivating virgin soil previously rolled and burned, aroused
interest among Australian orchidologists. Note by Dr. Rogers, to
whom specimens were forwarded for identification:</p>

<p>"A superficial examination of the single capitulum which first
reached me, suggested that it belonged to a member of the
<i>Glomerinae,</i> a group of orchids chiefly restricted to the
Malaysian and Papuasian areas. Further examination, how-ever,
showed that there were tribal differences, and that like so many
Australian orchids, the new plant was neottious in character. It
had indeed distinct affinities with the <i>Gastrodiineae,</i> a
subtribe in which it is now usual to include <i>Gastrodia, R. Br.,
Didymoplexis, Griff., Leucolena, Ridl.,</i> and <i>Auxopas,
Scltr.</i> The first two genera are represented in our own flora,
the others are respectively endemic to the Malay Peninsula and
Cameroons. Of these four, it is undoubtedly the most closely
related to <i>Gastrodia, R. Br</i>. From this, how-ever, it differs
in the remarkable inflorescence of numerous sessile flowers, united
by their ovaries and crowded together in a bracteate capitulum;
also in its unwinged column, and in its stigma which is situated on
the face of the column near the apex, and not at the base as in
<i>Gastrodia,</i> and likewise by its slenderly clawed, very
movable and exceedingly fleshy labellum. Some of these differences
appear to be of sufficient importance to warrant its exclusion from
the <i>Gastrodiinae</i>. I must therefore regard it as the type of
a new sub-tribe, belonging to the <i>Polychondreae.</i> The
records, as shown by the material available, indicate extreme
stress of environment followed by the most abject plant poverty and
degradation."</p>
