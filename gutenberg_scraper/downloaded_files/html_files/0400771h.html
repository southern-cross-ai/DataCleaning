<h4 id="intro">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>By the year 1642 the star of Spanish Admiralty had waned in the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The Dutch East India Company, clutching for trade and empire,
was ready to grasp the Spanish legacy of great voyages of
discovery.</p>

<p>The lure of the supposed great southern continent and all that
it might bring was a subject of serious discussion by the
Governor-General and Council in the Castle at Batavia.</p>

<p>Long sections of the west, north and southern coasts of
Australia were known. Indeed for nearly 25 years the west coast had
been a shore of disaster for the Company as ship after ship drove
onto its outlying reefs and islands.</p>

<p>In 1642 Governor General Anthony Van Diemen was ready to try
again, this time far south of the normal trade routes.</p>

<p>The commander he chose was Abel Jansz Tasman who, at the age of
39, had 10 years of service with the Company behind him.</p>

<p>His Journal of the voyage is a remarkable document. While
extracts relating to his coastings of Tasmania and New Zealand have
been frequently quoted by historians the full journal has not been
printed for nearly 70 years. It also puts the voyage into true
perspective as one of the great feats of Pacific exploration. For
Tasman's instructions were not only concerned with the discovery of
the supposed Terra Australis.</p>

<p>The Council of Batavia was just as anxious for proof of a
southern sea passage to Chile and the rediscovery of the Solomon
Islands, as well as further exploration of the New Guinea
coastline.</p>

<p>For those with a particular interest in navigation two points
should be kept in mind when following the Journal. Firstly Tasman's
longitudes are reckoned from Teneriffe which is approximately 16
1/2 degrees west of Greenwich. The miles quoted in the daily run of
the ships are Dutch miles, each approximately four times as great
as our present English land mile.</p>

<p>Of Tasman's 1644 voyage around the northern and north-west
Australian coastline only the sailing instructions printed
following the journal plus a chart have ever come to light. His
journal of that great voyage has been lost.</p>

<p>Soon after the 1644 voyage Tasman was made a member of the
Council of Justice at Batavia and elevated to the rank of
Commander.</p>

<p>He continued in the service of the Company until 1653 and we
have knowledge of him trading to Siam in 1647 and fighting against
the Spanish in the Philippines in 1648.</p>

<p>Tasman died in Batavia after his retirement and, while the year
is uncertain, there is evidence to indicate that it was probably
1659.</p>

<p>While his voyage of discovery established him as the greatest of
the early Dutch explorers and added to the knowledge of the
south-west Pacific and the Australian coastline, both were
commercial failures for the Dutch East India Company.</p>

<p>The fact that Tasman brought back no news of lands profitable
for trade or exploitation may well be responsible for the lack of
interest that the Dutch showed in Australia and the south-west
Pacific area from the mid-17th century onwards.</p>

<p>Not for another 125 years, with the first voyage of Captain
Cook, would the discoveries of Tasman be followed up. From that
point on the fruits of exploration went to the British people.</p>

<hr class="w30">

<h4 id="journal">TASMAN'S JOURNAL.</h4>

<p>Journal or Description drawn up by me, Abel Jansz Tasman, of a
voyage made from the town of Batavia in East India for the
discovery of the unknown South land in the year of our Lord 1642,
the 14th of August. May God Almighty vouchsafe His blessing on this
work.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This day August 14, A.D. 1642, we set sail from the roads of
Batavia with two ships, the Yacht Heemskerk and the Flute Zeehaan,
the wind being north-east with good weather. On the same day in the
evening the Zeehaan ran aground near the island of Rotterdam, but
got afloat again in the night without any notable damage, after
which we continued our voyage to the Straits of Sunda.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>Towards evening we went to Mr. Sweers, who was on board the
Yacht Bredam, from whom we understand that at Bantam point there
lay at anchor a galiot, newly arrived from the Netherlands; at
night we anchored off Anjer in 22 fathom, where we refitted our
ship which was disabled to such a degree that we could not possibly
have put to sea in her.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>The wind continuing east with a steady breeze, the current
running fast from Sunda Strait; at night we weighed anchor with the
wind blowing from the land, set sail and shaped our course so as to
pass between the Prince Islands and Cracatouw.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>In the morning we had the Prince Islands south-west and
Cracatouw north-west by north of us, the wind being south-east, our
course south-west by west; at noon we had the southernmost of the
Prince Islands east-south-east of us at 5 miles distance, ourselves
being in 6 degrees 20 minutes Southern Latitude and 124 degrees
Longitude; in the afternoon we drifted in a calm; in the said
afternoon it was resolved that from Sunda Strait we shall sail 200
miles to the south-west by west, as far as 14 degrees South
Latitude; from there to the west-south-west as far as 20 degrees
South Latitude, and from there due west as far as the island of
Mauritius.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>Latitude by estimation 6 degrees 48 minutes, longitude 123
degrees 20 minutes, the wind south-east with good weather, course
kept south-west by west as resolved on in council on the 17th,
sailed 13 miles; at night we had heavy rains with thunder and
lightning.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>At noon we found the latitude to be 8 degrees 38 minutes, the
longitude 120 degrees 35 minutes; we sailed 36 miles; course kept
by estimation south-west by west, but we find we are more to the
south; wind south-east by east, top-gallant gale; variation of the
compass 3 degrees north-westerly.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude observed 11 degrees 12 minutes, Longitude 116
degrees 42 minutes; wind south-east, top-gallant gale, course kept

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude observed 13 degrees 31 minutes, Longitude 114
degrees 40 minutes; wind south-east, top-gallant gale, course kept

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>At noon estimated Latitude 17 degrees 50 minutes, Longitude 100

glasses in the first watch we again had the wind south-south-east,
top-gallant gale, course kept west-south-west, sailed 28 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 30th.</p>

<p>At noon estimated Latitude 18 degrees 51 minutes, Longitude 97

<p>At noon estimated Latitude 19 degrees 55 minutes, Longitude 95
degrees 14 minutes; wind south-south-east, unsteady with drizzling
rain, course kept west-south-west, sailed 42 miles, shortly after
noon I compared notes with the skippers and steersmen, when we
found the average latitude to be 19 degrees 49 minutes and the do.
longitude 95 degrees 24 minutes; we continued to run
west-south-west until the evening and then west, being in the
longitude of the island of Mauritius.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of September.</p>

<p>At noon estimated Latitude 20 degrees 28 minutes, Longitude 92
degrees 19 minutes; wind south-east with a steady breeze and

degrees 13 minutes; wind easterly, light top-gallant gale, course
kept west-north-west, sailed 26 miles; variation 22 degrees 30
minutes; at night at the end of the first watch we saw land; we lay
a-trying with clewed sails all night.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>In the morning we saw that it was the island of Mauritius; we
steered for it and came to anchor before it at about 9 o'clock, we
being then in Latitude 20 degrees, Longitude 83 degrees 48 minutes.
When we saw the island of Mauritius we were by estimation still 50
miles east of it.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>We sent 6 sailors, three belonging to the Zeehaan and three to
our ship, together with one of our second mates, to the wood to
assist the huntsmen there in capturing game and bring the same down
to our ships. At noon we saw a ship outside the bay before the
entrance, which ship came to anchor near us about 4 hours later,
when we understood her to be the Arent, which had sailed from the
Texel on the 23rd of April last in company with the ships Salmander
and Zutphen, the Yacht Leuwerick and the galiot Visscher, the said
ships and yachts having parted company with her at the Zoute
islands in order to continue their voyage to Batavia. The said
Arent brought a quantity of provisions such as victuals and
ammunition of war, together with a number of soldiers and sailors
for the island of Mauritius. The officers of the said Yacht
reported to Commander Van der Stel that on the 27th ultimo they had
got to Diego Rodrigos, believing it to be Mauritius, seeing that it
is in the same longitude as the latter island; that there they had
found a French ship lying at anchor on the roadstead; that they
could not clearly make out whence this ship had come, owing to the
evasive answers they received from the crew, some saying they had
come from Diepen, others from the Red Sea, and that they were bound
for the Mascarinas or were going to call at Madagascar; that they
had sailed from Diego Rodrigos at the same time with the French
ship and had parted company with her on the 5th instant at noon;
that they were still in sight of her in the evening, at which time
they saw that she shaped her course west-south-west. On this report
the Commander aforesaid straightways despatched some men to the
north-west side of the island in order to ascertain whether the
Frenchman could have gone thither, the Commander presuming that the
Frenchman might have attempted to mislead our people to get an
opportunity of cutting some ebony wood there, which we were bound
to prevent him from doing.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>We were engaged nearly all day repairing our ropes and tackle;
considering that our rigging was old, weak and not much to be
depended on we added three more large ropes to the rigging on both
sides the main and foremast in order to steady the same; towards
evening we got 8 head of goats and one pig from shore.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>In the morning we sent to the Zeehaan four out of the 8 goats
received yesterday; also sent for one more sailor in her whom,
together with one of our own men, we despatched to shore to assist
the huntsmen and the men who went ashore on the 6th instant.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>We sent one of our carpenters together with 7 or 8 sailors from
our ship and from the Zeehaan to the wood in order to cut down
timber; in the afternoon we wrote an order to the officers of the
Zeehaan, enjoining them to serve out to each of their men no more
than half a mutchkin of arrack as his daily ration. Then Worshipful
Van der Stel informs us that he has got positive orders from the
Honourable Governor-General and Councillors of India not to serve
out more than one small glass of arrack to each of his men, and
this only to such as are cold, wet and dirty. In order to maintain
peace among the men and prevent discontent, ill-will and envy as
far as in us lies we have therefore deemed it best to serve out
only half a small glass of arrack to our men while we are lying in
this roadstead.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>We sent our Skipper Ide Tjercxz to bring on board of us the
Honourable Van der Stel with whom we discussed the question whether
it would not be needed for our ships, and advantageous to the
Company, before sailing from here to continue our destined voyage
to appoint a place of rendezvous, the rather as the Honourable
Governor-General and Councillors of India have expressly and
instantly enjoined and recommended the appointing of such a place
of rendezvous in our instructions; after due deliberation we
summoned on board of us all our skippers, first and second mates,
and informed them that we desired all persons present to give their
advice in writing what place were best to fix upon for a
rendezvous, in case we should get separated from each other by
rough weather, storms or other accidents (which we hope will be
spared us and God in his mercy advert) to the end that we may join
company again; and that, after being made acquainted with each
person's advice, we shall resolve upon such a line of action as
shall be serviceable to the Company and to the furtherance of our
voyage. In the evening we got from shore 8 goats and 2 hogs; our
carpenter Jan Joppen also returned on board, reporting that they
had cut down a number of trees for timber but that no more fitting
was to be had at that place.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>In the morning our skipper, together with the carpenter
aforesaid, went to the wood in the boat for the purpose of fetching
thence the timber, and took the same to the fortress of Frederik
Heyndrick, there to be sawn into boards of the most fitting
dimensions. In the afternoon we sent 4 goats and one hog to those
on board the Zeehaan.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>In the morning our boat went to the wood a second time, and
again took some logs to the fortress aforesaid. Towards the evening
we again received 12 goats, half of which we sent to the Zeehaan.
Our skipper reported that one of our sailors, Joris Claesen van
Bahuys by name, had badly hurt himself in handling a log that was
to be sawn ashore; on which we forthwith sent on shore our chief
and assistant barbers to examine the patient and give him the
requisite attendance.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>Nothing worth mentioning occurred today except that we sent a
bag of rice to our men in the wood and fished our main-yard.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>We again received from shore 4 goats and 2 hogs, of each of
which we sent half to the Zeehaan. In the evening the men
despatched by the Honourable Van der Stel on the 6th instant
returned, reporting that in none of the bays they had seen any sign
of the French ship.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>In the morning we sent ashore our chief boatswain and
boatswain's mate with a number of sailors and a quantity of cordage
in order to make ropes.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>The Yacht Cleyn Mauritius sailed from here in order to fetch
ebony from a spot about 10 miles to the eastward, to serve as cargo
for the Arent; having got near the entrance of the bay she cast
anchor because unable to beat out owing to strong wind. Towards
noon the Honourable Van der Stel and Tasman convened on board the
admiral the councils of the Fortress of Frederick Hendrik of the
ships Heemskerk and Zeehaan and of the Yacht Arent, and submitted
to the Council what was next resolved upon, as may be seen from
this day's resolution. Towards the evening our second mate Chryn
Hendricx, whom on the 6th instant we had dispatched to the huntsmen
in the wood, returned on board bringing 10 head of goats; this day
we ordered one of the second mates of the Zeehaan to go to the wood
in our second mate's stead.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>In the morning we sent our other second mate Carsten Jurriaens
to the wood with six sailors to cut firewood; towards the evening
we delivered 4 out of the 10 goats received yesterday to those on
board the Zeehaan. This day by order of Commander Van der Stel and
in pursuance of yesterday's resolution we took out of the Yacht
Arent for the behoof of our ship and the Zeehaan the goods
following, to wit:</p>

<ul>
<li>6 ropes both large and small.</li>

<li>1 roll canvas.</li>

<li>20 pulleys, both large and small.</li>

<li>1/2 skin for pump-leather.</li>

<li>6 small clew-lines.</li>

<li>1 kedge-anchor.</li>

<li>A parcel of flat-headed nails.</li>

<li>4 pieces of horn for mending the lanterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred worth mentioning except that we fished our
foremast at the back and got from shore 6 head of hogs, out of
which at nightfall we gave three to the quartermaster of the
Zeehaan.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>The carpenters caulked the ship on the outside, stopped all the
leaks they could find, and furthermore overhauled everything and
duly pitched the seams.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>I went shooting early in the morning in the west part of the
island of Mauritius in company with Mr. Van der Maerzen, subcargo
and second in command in the fortress of Fredrick Hendrick; we
returned on board towards noon with 13 wild birds. This day we had
a number of sawn boards brought from shore and a quantity of rope
made ashore.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>In the morning the Yacht Cleyn Mauritius got clear of the bay
and set sail for her destination to fetch ebony for the cargo of
the Arent; from the 16th instant when she left this roadstead she
had been unable to beat out owing to the strong east-south-east
trade-wind. This day we made a new main-top and fished the foremast
near the top-yard on both sides; in the evening we received from
shore 10 head of cattle to wit: 7 goats and 3 hogs.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>In the morning ourselves and Gerrit Jansz, Skipper in the
Zeehaan, together with a number of sailors with axes, went ashore
to the wood in order to procure fitting timber for top-yards,
anchor-stocks and mizzen-yards etc., for the purposes of our
further voyage; we returned towards evening bringing a piece of
round timber proper for fishing a top-yard, and also an
anchor-stock for ourselves and two ditto for the Zeehaan.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>We fetched from the wood 3 anchor-stocks and a round piece of
timber for a top-yard with a quantity of firewood, and got a
boatload of water from a watercourse east of the fortress of
Fredrick Henrick.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>We brought from shore a boatload of firewood and three ditto of
water. Towards the evening we received in the huntsmen's boat 5
goats and three hogs, of which the same evening we handed three
goats and one hog into the boat of the Zeehaan; during the night in
the second watch we got on board another boat with 7 casks of
water.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>In the morning at daybreak there was a light breeze blowing from
the land, at first from the north-north-east, afterwards somewhat
fresher from north-west by west and west-north-west, which was the
first land-breeze we had from the time we had come to anchor here.
This day two pinnaces of firewood and two boatloads of water were
fetched from shore; item our pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz and Mr.
Gilsemans made a surveying of the coast.</p>

<p>Item the 26th.</p>

<p>We convened the council of the Heemskerk and the flute Zeehaan
and resolved upon sailing from here on the 4th proximo, as may be
more detailedly seen from today's resolution.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>We sent our second mate Chryn Heyndrickse to the wood to cut
firewood.</p>

<p>Item the 28th.</p>

<p>We sent our pinnace and boat to the wood to get firewood.</p>

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>We still kept sending the pinnace and boat ashore for firewood;
this day the Yacht Cleyn Mauritius &nbsp;returned, bringing one of
the runaway Madagascar slaves.</p>

<p>Item the last.</p>

<p>We were still busy taking in firewood; towards the evening we
got ten goats.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of October.</p>

<p>We were still engaged in taking in firewood with our pinnace and
boat; towards the evening we got from shore 9 head of cattle, both
he-goats and she-goats.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>Still busy taking in firewood and refilling the water-casks
which were emptied day by day.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>Still kept the boat and pinnace at fetching water and firewood;
at dusk we received on board 7 head of cattle, to wit 2 hogs, 4
he-goats and one she-goat.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>This was the day we had fixed upon for putting to sea but owing
to contrary winds we were unable to stand out to sea, so that we
were forced to remain at anchor; we therefore despatched the
pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz and the first mate of the Zeehaan,
Heyndrick Pietersen, to take soundings in the eastern entrance,
whence we were to set sail, where they sounded barely 13 feet at
high-water at spring-tide.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>The contrary wind still continuing, we were unable to beat out
of the bay, and therefore sent our pinnace with the second mate
Carsten Jurriaensz to catch fish with the dragnet, who returning
brought a capital lot of fish for the whole of our crew.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>We warped the kedge-anchor to get out at the south-east entrance
and kedged a second time, but were compelled to give it up owing to
the strong contrary wind. Towards the evening we learnt that the
men sent out to seek the runaway Madagascar slaves had come back
without having seen any of them; this day we again got a capital
lot of fish for the whole crew.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>The wind blowing from the east we were still busy with the
kedge-anchor; in the evening we came to anchor under the islands in
front of the bay in sixty fathom muddy bottom; this bay is very
hard to get out of seeing that the south-east wind is continually
blowing here; whoever has no urgent business here had better keep
out of it.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>In the morning the weather rainy with a light land-breeze and
whirlwinds; we weighed our anchors but had to drop them again owing
to contrary winds; about 8 o'clock the wind turned to the
north-east by east, we weighed anchor and accordingly ran out to
sea south-eastward, for which God be praised and thanked; the
southern extremity of this island of Mauritius is in 20 degrees 12
minutes South Latitude and 78 degrees 47 minutes Longitude. We
shaped our course to the south-south-east, having the wind
north-east, a weak top-gallant gale; at noon we turned our course
to the south by east.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude observed 21 degrees 5 minutes, Longitude 78
degrees 47 minutes, course kept south, sailed 13 miles with good
weather and a light breeze, the wind south-east. This day we drew
up a resolution respecting the crew's meals as may be further seen
from the same; in the evening we had the island of Mauritius still
in sight.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude estimated 21 degrees 54 minutes, Longitude 78
degrees 11 minutes; course kept south-west by south, sailed 15
miles, the wind being south-east with a light top-gallant gale;
towards daybreak the sea began to run high from the south and we
found our mizzen-mast to be quite broken at the partner so that we
had to fish it on both sides.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude estimated 23 degrees 28 minutes, Longitude 77
degrees 51 minutes; the wind easterly with a light top-gallant
gale, course kept south by west, sailed 24 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude observed 25 degrees 18 minutes, Longitude 77
degrees 51 minutes; the wind northerly with a light top-gallant
gale with good weather, a clear sky and smooth water; course kept
south, sailed 28 miles; we again fished our mizzen-mast. Variation
23 degrees 30 minutes North-West.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude estimated 27 degrees 26 minutes, Longitude 77
degrees 51 minutes; course kept south, sailed 32 miles, the wind
from the north-west; in the morning rain and a top-gallant
gale.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude observed 29 degrees 20 minutes, Longitude 78
degrees 45 minutes; course kept south-south-east, sailed 29 miles,
the wind west and west-south-west with a top-gallant gale; at night
at the end of the first watch, the wind becoming south-south-east,
we turned to the west. Variation 23 degrees 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>The wind south-east and east-south-east with a dark sky and a
stiff breeze; at noon Latitude estimated 29 degrees 45 minutes,
Longitude 78 degrees 57 minutes; course kept south-south-east,
sailed 7 miles; towards the evening we got the wind east by south
with a drizzling rain.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>The wind south and south-south-east, at times south-east and
east-south-east with a top-gallant gale; at noon we were in 31
degrees 17 minutes South Latitude, and Longitude 78 degrees 13
minutes; course kept south-south-west, sailed 25 miles. Variation
25 degrees 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>A calm, the wind westerly; course kept south-south-east, sailed
9 miles; at noon Latitude observed 31 degrees 51 minutes, Longitude
78 degrees 26 minutes. Towards noon we got a light top-gallant
gale, wind as before. Variation 25 degrees 30 minutes
North-West.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>Good weather with a westerly wind and a top-gallant gale; at
noon Latitude observed 33 degrees 56 minutes; course kept south by
east, sailed 32 miles. Towards the evening the Zeehaan hove to
leeward, whereupon we forthwith made towards her, she calling out
to us that the wales to which her shroud-bolts are fixed had got
disjoined so that they had to be fished. Variation 24 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>About 9 o'clock we got the wind south-south-west with drizzling
rain and afterwards it fell a dead calm. At noon Latitude estimated
36 degrees 2 minutes, Longitude 80 degrees; course kept
south-south-east, sailed 34 miles, with a top-gallant gale; in the
afternoon the wind turned to the south-east and we tacked to the
west.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>Foggy weather with a drizzling rain. At noon Latitude estimated
36 degrees 29 minutes, Longitude 79 degrees 25 minutes; course kept
south-west with variable winds and the weather improving; sailed 10
miles; towards the evening the south-south-east wind fell almost to
a calm.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>Variable winds alternating with calms; at noon Latitude observed
36 degrees 22 minutes, Longitude 79 degrees 25 minutes, so that we
found we had drifted two miles to northward. Towards evening we got
a breeze from the north-west.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>Dark drizzly water with a westerly wind and a steady breeze; at
noon Latitude estimated 38 degrees 11 minutes, Longitude 78 degrees
57 minutes; course kept south by east, sailed 28 miles. Variation
24 degrees 40 minutes North-West.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind began to blow stiffly from the
west-south-west and south-west so that we had to take in our
topsail. At noon Latitude estimated 40 degrees 18 minutes,
Longitude 80 degrees 46 minutes, course kept south-east by south,
sailed 40 miles; in the afternoon we turned our course to the
south-east and had heavy showers of rain from time to time.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>In the morning we took in our bonnets, lowered our foresail down
to the stem, and ran on before the wind with our mainsail only; we
dared not try to the wind because of the strong gale blowing. This
gale was attended with hail and rain to such a degree that we
feared the ship would not live through it, but at noon the storm
somewhat abated so that we hauled to the wind; we could not see the
Zeehaan, for which reason we hauled to the wind to stay for her. At
noon Latitude estimated 40 degrees 42 minutes, Longitude 83 degrees
11 minutes; course kept east by south, sailed 30 miles; the wind
south-west and south with a violent storm; we kept a sharp lookout
for the Zeehaan but could not get sight of her.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>In the morning we sent a man to the masthead to look out for our
partner whom he saw astern, of which we were full glad; the weather
getting slightly better we again set our bonnets and drew up the
foresail. Towards noon the Zeehaan again joined us. At noon our
estimated latitude was 39 degrees 58 minutes and Longitude 84
degrees 11; course kept north-north-east, sailed or drifted 12
miles; at noon we shaped our course to the south-east, with a
south-west wind and a steady breeze.</p>

<p>Item the 26th.</p>

<p>Good weather, the wind south-west by west with a top-gallant
gale; at noon Latitude observed 41 degrees 34 minutes, Longitude 86
degrees 10 minutes; course kept south-east, sailed 32 miles; the
sea still kept running high from the south-south-east; we changed
our course to south-east by south and south-south-east; we spoke
the Zeehaan and understood that this day a man died on board of
her; as we were speaking the Zeehaan she broke her top-yard, which
was forthwith replaced by another which they kept in stock. This
day average Longitude 86 degrees 14 minutes, Latitude 41 degrees 40
minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>In the morning before early breakfast we saw a good deal of
rock-weed and manna-grass floating about; we therefore hoisted a
flag, upon which the officers of the Zeehaan came to board of us;
we convened the Council and submitted to their consideration the
instructions of the Honourable Governor-General and Councillors of
India in case we should see and observe land, shoals, sunken rocks,
etc. We then submitted to the council the question whether, now
that we observed these signs of land, it would not be best to keep
a man at the masthead constantly and make him look out for land,
shoals, sunken rocks and other dangers; also what sum had best be
fixed upon as a reward to be given to him who should first see
land, upon which the Council thought fit to keep a man on the
lookout constantly, and to give three pieces-of-eight and a can of
arrack to whoever shall first see and observe land, shoals, sunken
rocks, etc.; all of which may in extenso be seen from this day's
&nbsp;resolution. At noon our estimated latitude was 43 degrees,
and longitude 88 degrees 6 minutes; course kept south-east, sailed
30 miles, the wind being westerly with a top-gallant gale and a
drizzling rain. Variation 26 degrees 45 minutes. At night we lay
a-trying under reduced sail.</p>

<p>Item the 28th.</p>

<p>At daybreak we made sail again, turned our course
south-south-eastward, in dark foggy weather; we still saw seaweeds
floating about; at noon we estimated ourselves to be in Latitude 44
degrees 47 minutes South, and Longitude 89 degrees 7 minutes;
course kept south-south-east, sailed 29 miles, in a north-westerly
and westerly wind with a top-gallant gale; we also saw fragments of
trees floating about resembling the leaves of wild bananas; at
night we lay a-trying under reduced sail and dared not run on on
account of the fog; gradually however the sea began to get smooth;
we time after time fired a musket and now and then also a great
gun.</p>

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>In the morning we made sail again, held our course to the
south-south-east, spoke the officers of the Zeehaan, because we
thought it best to keep our course to eastward so long as the fog
should last. Having hailed the friends of the Zeehaan we called out
to them whether, seeing that in this fog and darkness it is hardly
possible to survey known shores, let alone to discover unknown
land, it would not be best and most advisable to shape our course
to eastward until the advent of clearer weather and a better
prospect; the which they deemed highly advisable; on which account
we convened the ship's council with the second mates, and informed
them of what the officers of the Zeehaan had said when we had
spoken them, together with their opinion and advice; after which we
asked all the persons assembled what they thought best to be done;
whereupon a unanimous resolution was come to which may in extenso
be gathered from this day's resolution and is fully accordant with
the opinion of the officers of the Zeehaan. At noon we directed our
course to eastward with a north-north-westerly wind and a
top-gallant gale; our estimated latitude being 45 degrees 47
minutes, and Longitude 89 degrees 44 minutes; course kept
south-south-east sailed 17 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 30th.</p>

<p>At daybreak we again made sail, shaped our course to eastward
with a clear sky and a top-gallant gale from the west. At noon
Latitude observed 45 degrees 43 minutes, Longitude 91 degrees 51
minutes; course kept east, sailed 22 miles. Variation 26 degrees 45
minutes.</p>

<p>Item the last.</p>

<p>Towards noon a drizzling rain came on with fog, while the wind
stiffened more and more, so that we took in our topsails; at noon
we also took in our main-sail and ran on before the wind with our
foresail, wind and sea running very high. At noon Latitude
estimated 47 degrees 4 minutes, Longitude 95 degrees 19 minutes;
course kept east-south-east, sailed 50 miles; we then had a storm
from the west and held our course to the east.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of November.</p>

<p>In the morning the weather having somewhat improved we made more
sail. At noon observed Latitude 46 degrees 9 minutes, Longitude 99
degrees 9 minutes; we were greatly surprised at finding ourselves
so far northward as we had estimated ourselves to be in 47 degrees,
and now found our latitude to be 46 degrees 9 minutes; course kept
east but if we make allowance for the error in our estimation our
course is east by north half a point more northerly, and we sailed
40 miles; in the afternoon the weather became foggy, the wind
turning to the north-west with a light breeze; we saw a great
quantity of rock-weed floating and shaped our course to the
south-east, seeing that we were so far to northward; at night we
lay a-trying under reduced sail. This day our master-gunner Eldert
Luytiens departed this life in the Lord.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>In the morning we made sail again, shaping our course to the
south-east; the wind north-west with a steady breeze; we sailed
with the main-sail set, the weather being very foggy; course kept
east-south-east, sailed 25 miles; estimated Latitude 46 degrees 47
minutes, Longitude 101 degrees 23 minutes; we saw still a good deal
of rock-weed floating about; at night we again lay a-trying with
clewed sails as we dared not run on on account of the fog.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>The wind being south-west with a strong breeze we again made
sail, held our course to south-eastward, and from time to time had
heavy squalls of hail and snow with very cold weather. At noon
Latitude observed 46 degrees 47 minutes, Longitude 103 degrees 58
minutes; course kept east by south, sailed 27 miles; between the
squalls we could keep a fair lookout so that we kept sailing during
the night; we again saw quantities of rock-weed floating about from
time to time, and found that we were driven to the north.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>Wind and weather as before our course still being south-east; at
noon we altered our course to eastward; Latitude estimated 48
degrees 25 minutes, Longitude 107 degrees 56 minutes; course kept
south-east by east, sailed 40 miles. In the afternoon we desired
our skipper and mates to give in their average longitude and
southern latitude which, after comparison with our own, we found to
average 107 degrees 25 minutes Longitude and 48 degrees 28 minutes
South Latitude. After this comparison of notes we convened the
ship's council with the second mates, and submitted to their
consideration what was subsequently unanimously resolved upon and
is found duly specified in today's resolution, to which for
briefness sake we refer. Towards evening we again saw various lots
of rock-weed floating about, and observed large numbers of tunnies
near and roundabout the ship; our boatswain's mate and one of the
sailors also saw a seal, from which we surmise that there may be
islands hereabouts, since these animals are not likely to go out
far to sea; on this account we did not venture to run on full sail,
but after supper held northward under reduced sail.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>In the morning we had rather foggy, hazy and dirty weather with
a dark grey sky; we made sail again and at first ran on east by
south, seeing that last night we had been driven so far northward.
At noon Latitude estimated 48 degrees 25 minutes, Longitude 110
degrees 55 minutes; course kept east and sailed 30 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>We had a storm from the west with hail and snow, and ran on
before the wind with our foresail barely halfway the mast; the sea
ran very high and our men begin to suffer badly from the severe
cold. At noon Latitude estimated 49 degrees 4 minutes, Longitude
114 degrees 56 minutes; course kept east by south, sailed 49 miles.
Variation 26 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>We received the notes following from our Pilot major.</p>

<p>Annotations drawn from the terrestrial globe and from the large
chart of the South Sea, and on the 7th of November A.D. 1642,
handed to the Honourable Commander Abel Jansz Tasman together with
our advice.</p>

<p>Imprimis:</p>

<p>The terrestrial globe shows us that the easternmost islands of
the Salomonis are in the longitude of fully 220 degrees, reckoning
said longitude from the meridian of the islands of Corvo and
Floris.</p>

<p>But they are in slightly short of 205 degrees, according to the
longitude which starts from the island of Teneriffe, and which is
most generally used at present; and on the globe they extend from 7
to 14 to 15 degrees Latitude south of the line equinoctial.</p>

<p>This being duly noted we shall follow the great chart of the
South Sea, using the longitude beginning from the Peak of
Teneriffe, which is generally used in our day.</p>

<p>First we have Batavia situated in Longitude 127 degrees 5
minutes. And the south-west point of Celebes 11 degrees 20 minutes.
More to eastward, so that we get for the longitude of the
south-west point of Celebes now from the south-west point of
Celebes to the easternmost islands of the Salomonis, where the
chart reads Hoorensche eylanden, we reckon 47 degrees 20 minutes.
So that we get for the longitude of the Hoorensche islands 185
degrees 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Now from the Hoorensche islands to the Cocos or Verraders
islands, discovered by Willem Schouten, we reckon still more to
eastward 8 degrees 15 minutes; so that for the longitude of Cocos
and Verraders islands we get 194 degrees.</p>

<p>Should one wish to consider the Hoorensche islands, situated in
Longitude 185 degrees 45 minutes, to be the easternmost of the
Salomonis, then the charts and globe would show a difference of
about 19 degrees; but if one should look upon the Cocos and
Verraders island, situated in 194 degrees Longitude and 17 1/2
degrees South Latitude, as the easternmost of the Salomonis
islands, then the difference between the charts and the globe would
amount to no more than 11 degrees, the globe placing the islands 11
degrees more eastward than the charts; now to avoid all mistakes we
think it best to disregard the indications to eastward, both of the
globe and of the charts.</p>

<p>Hence our advice is that we should stick to the 44th degree
South Latitude until we shall have passed the 150th degree of
Longitude, and then run north as far as the 40th degree South
Latitude, remaining there with an easterly course until we shall
have reached the 220th degree of Longitude, after which we should
take a northerly course so as to avail ourselves of the trade-wind
to reach the Salomonis islands and New Guinea by running from east
to west. We cannot but think that, if we find no land up to 150
degrees Longitude, we shall then be in an open sea again, unless we
should meet with islands; all which time and experience, being the
best of teachers, will no doubt bring to light.</p>

<p>Signed Francoys Jacobsz.</p>

<p>In the morning, the wind still westerly with hail and snow so
that we had to run on with a furled foresail as before, and as we
could not make any progress in this way, we deemed it best to alter
our course to northward upon which, with our ship's council
together with our second mates, seeing that we could not speak the
friends of the Zeehaan, much less get them on board of us, we
resolved first to our course north-eastward, running on to 45 or 44
degrees; having reached the 45th or 44th degree, to direct our
course due east until we shall have got to 150 degrees Longitude;
as will be found duly specified in today's resolution, to which we
beg to refer. At noon Latitude estimated 47 degrees 56 minutes,
Longitude 119 degrees 6 minutes; course kept east-north-east,
sailed 45 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>In the morning the weather was somewhat better so that we could
set our topsails. At noon Latitude estimated 46 degrees 26 minutes,
Longitude 121 degrees 19 minutes; course kept north-east, sailed 32
miles, with unsettled weather and a westerly wind, which is very
variable here. At night we ran on under reduced sail. Variation 25
degrees 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>The wind southerly with a grey sky and a top-gallant gale; at
noon Latitude estimated 44 degrees 19 minutes South, Longitude 124
degrees 20 minutes; course kept north-east, sailed 45 miles. At
noon the latitude observed was 44 degrees, which does not agree
with our estimation as given above. We still saw rock-weed floating
about the whole day. At noon we shaped our course east in
accordance with the resolution of the 7th instant. Towards evening
we dispatched to the officers of the Zeehaan the letter following,
together with the Annotations of Pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz, the
said papers being enclosed in a wooden canister-shot-case, duly
waxed and closely wrapped up in tarred canvas, which case we sent
adrift from the stern part of the poop; the letter duly reached its
destination and ran as follows:</p>

<p>To the officers of the Zeehaan.</p>

<p>We should have greatly liked to have had your advice on the 7th
instant but, time and opportunity being unpropitious, we resolved
with the members of our council and our second mates to shape our
course north-east as far as 44 degrees South Latitude, and then
keep a due east course as far as 150 degrees Longitude; should you
agree to this resolution then be pleased to hoist a flag at your
stern as a sign of approval that we may duly ratify the resolution.
We also request you to do your best to sail in during the night
until further orders and, if you should think it possible to come
alongside of us in the boat, be pleased to float a flag from the
foretop by way of signal, in which case we shall stay for you,
seeing that we are very desirous of communicating with you by word
of mouth. Farewell. Actum Heemskerk sailing in about 44 degrees
South Latitude, this day November 9, 1642.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>ABEL JANSZ TASMAN.</p>

<p>After reading the above, those of the Zeehaan hoisted the
Prince-flag in sign of approbation of our resolution.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>Good weather with a southerly wind and a top-gallant gale. At
noon Latitude estimated 44 degrees; Longitude 126 degrees 45
minutes; course kept east, sailed 26 miles. At noon Latitude
observed 43 degrees 20 minutes, the sea running very high from the
south-west, at times also from the south-east with heavy swells.
Variation 21 degrees 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>Good weather, the wind westerly with a light breeze. At noon
Latitude estimated 43 degrees 20 minutes, Longitude 127 degrees 45
minutes; course kept east, sailed 11 miles. We ran up the white
flag, upon which the officers of the Zeehaan came on board of us,
when we resolved in the plenary Council to run on in the parallel
of about 44 degrees South Latitude from our present longitude
(averaging 123 degrees 29 minutes) as far as 195 degrees Longitude,
being the meridian of the east side of New Guinea as delineated in
the chart, all which may in extenso be seen from this day's
resolution to which we beg leave to refer.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>Good weather and smooth water, the wind westerly with a light
top-gallant breeze. At noon Latitude observed 43 degrees 50
minutes, Longitude 129 degrees 17 minutes; course kept
east-south-east, sailed 18 miles. Variation 21 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>Dark, hazy, foggy weather with a steady breeze; we still see
rock-weed floating about every day. At noon Latitude estimated 44
degrees 16 minutes, Longitude 132 degrees 17 minutes; course kept
east by south, sailed 33 miles; wind north-west; at noon we turned
our course to eastward.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>Still dark, hazy, drizzling weather, the wind west-north-west
with a steady breeze. At noon Latitude estimated 44 degrees 16
minutes south, Longitude 136 degrees 22 minutes; course kept east
and sailed 44 miles; the sea still running high from the south-west
so that no mainland is yet to be surmised south of us.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>Good weather and a steady breeze from the west-north-west. At
noon Latitude observed 44 degrees 3 minutes, Longitude 140 degrees
31 minutes; course kept east slightly northerly, sailed 45 miles.
Variation decreasing 18 degrees 50 minutes North-West. We still saw
rock-weed floating about every day.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>In the morning it was very foggy but the weather cleared up
towards noon. Latitude observed 44 degrees 10 minutes, Longitude
144 degrees 42 minutes; course kept east, sailed 45 miles with a
steady breeze from the west; in the evening we took the sun's
azimuth. Variation 16 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>Good weather with a clear sky; we still saw a good deal of
rock-weed floating about every day; the sea still running from the
south-west. Though we observe rock-weed every day still it is not
likely there should be any great mainland to the southward on
account of the high seas that are still running from the south. At
noon Latitude observed 44 degrees 15 minutes, Longitude 147 degrees
3 minutes; course kept east, sailed 28 miles with a light
top-gallant breeze from the west; we estimated that we had already
passed the South land known up to the present, or so far as Pieter
Nuyts had run to eastward.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>The wind north-westerly and afterwards northerly with a fog and
drizzling rain, a top-gallant gale. At noon Latitude estimated 44
degrees 16 minutes South, Longitude 150 degrees 6 minutes; course
kept east, sailed 33 miles. This day we saw a number of whales; at
night during the dog-watch we lay a-trying under reduced sail.
Variation 12 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>Good weather with the wind from the north and afterwards from
the north-west, a top-gallant gale. At noon Latitude estimated 44
degrees 45 minutes, Longitude 153 degrees 34 minutes; course kept
east by south, sailed 38 miles. At noon Latitude observed 45
degrees 5 minutes so that we are farther to the south than I had
estimated; in the morning variation decreasing, 8 degrees
North-West. Towards evening there came on a storm from the north
and afterwards from the north-west, with hail and snow and very
cold weather, so that we had to tack to leeward with our
mainsail.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>The wind west-north-west with a storm of hail and rain; in the
morning we had to run on before the wind with a foresail halfway up
the mast. At noon Latitude estimated 44 degrees 43 minutes,
Longitude 155 degrees 58 minutes; course kept east, sailed 26
miles; Latitude observed 44 degrees 32 minutes; during the night we
lay a-trying with our mainsail set.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>In the morning the weather somewhat better, we again set our
topsails and slid out the bonnet of our foresail; turned our course
to east-north-east, the wind being westerly and afterwards
north-westerly with a top-gallant gale. At noon Latitude estimated
43 degrees 53 minutes, Longitude 158 degrees 12 minutes; at noon
Latitude observed 43 degrees 40 minutes; course kept
east-north-east, sailed 26 miles. Variation 4 degrees North-West,
the sea running very high, both from the north-west and south-west;
during the night we lay a-trying under reduced sail.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>At daybreak we made sail again, the wind being westerly with a
top-gallant gale; there was a heavy swell from the south-west so
that there is not likely to be any land to southward. At noon
Latitude estimated 42 degrees 58 minutes, Longitude 160 degrees 34
minutes; course kept east-north-east, sailed 28 miles; at noon
Latitude observed 42 degrees 49 minutes; we found that our
compasses were not so steady as they should be, and supposed that
possibly there might be mines of loadstone about here, our
compasses sometimes varying 8 points from one moment to another, so
that there would always seem to be some cause that kept the needle
in motion.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>Good weather with a south-westerly wind and a steady breeze; in
the morning we found our rudder broken at top in the tiller-hole;
we there hauled to windward under reduced sail and fitted a
cross-beam to either side. At noon Latitude observed 42 degrees 50
minutes, Longitude 162 degrees 51 minutes; course kept east, sailed
25 miles; we found the variation to the compass to be 1 degree
North-West, so that the decrease is a very abrupt one here; by
estimation the west side of New Guinea must be north of us.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>Good weather and a clear sky. At noon Latitude observed 42
degrees 25 minutes, Longitude 163 degrees 31 minutes; course kept
east by north, sailed 30 miles; the wind south-westerly and
afterwards from the south with a light top-gallant breeze. In the
afternoon about 4 o'clock we saw land bearing east by north of us
at about 10 miles distance from us by estimation; the land we
sighted was very high; towards evening we also saw, east-south-east
of us, three high mountains, and to the north-east two more
mountains, but less high than those to southward; we found that
here our compass pointed due north. In the evening in the first
glass after the watch had been set, we convened our ship's council
with the second mate's and represented to them whether it would not
be advisable to run farther out to sea; we also asked their advice
as to the time when it would be best to do so, upon which it was
unanimously resolved to run out to sea at the expiration of three
glasses, to keep doing so for the space of ten glasses, and after
this to make for the land again; all of which may in extenso be
seen from today's resolution to which we beg leave to refer. During
the night when three glasses had run out the wind turned to the
south-east; we held off from shore and sounded in 100 fathom, fine
white sandy bottom with small shells; we sounded once more and
found black coarse sand with pebbles; during the night we had a
south-east wind with a light breeze.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>In the morning we had a calm; we floated the white flag and
pendant from our stern, upon which the officers of the Zeehaan with
their steersmen came on board of us; we then convened the Ship's
council and resolved together upon what may in extenso be seen from
today's resolution to which we beg leave to refer. Towards noon the
wind turned to the south-east and afterwards to the
south-south-east and the south, upon which we made for the shore;
at about 5 o'clock in the evening we got near the coast; three
miles off shore we sounded in 60 fathom coral bottom; one mile off
the coast we had clean, fine, white sand; we found this coast to
bear south by east and north by west; it was a level coast, our
ship being 42 degrees 30 minutes South Latitude, and average
Longitude 163 degrees 50 minutes. We then put off from shore again,
the wind turning to the south-south-east with a top-gallant gale.
If you came from the west and find your needle to show 4 degrees
north-westerly variation you had better look out for land, seeing
that the variation is very abruptly decreasing here. If you should
happen to be overtaken by rough weather from the westward you had
best heave to and not run on. Near the coast here the needle points
due north. We took the average of our several longitudes and found
this land to be in 163 degrees 50 minutes Longitude.</p>

<p>This land being the first land we have met with in the South Sea
and not known to any European nation we have conferred on it the
name of Anthony Van Diemensland in honour of the Honourable
Governor-General, our illustrious master, who sent us to make this
discovery; the islands circumjacent, so far as known to us, we have
named after the Honourable Councillors of India, as may be seen
from the little chart which has been made of them.</p>

<p>Item the 26th.</p>

<p>We had the wind from eastward with a light breeze and hazy
weather so that we could see no land; according to our estimation
we were at 9 1/2 miles distance from shore. Towards noon we hoisted
the top-pendant upon which the Zeehaan forthwith came astern of us;
we called out to her men that we should like Mr. Gilsemans to come
on board of us, upon which the said Mr. Gilsemans straightways came
on board of us, to whom we imparted the reasons set forth in the
subjoined letter which we enjoined him to take with him on board
the Zeehaan, to be shown to Skipper Gerrit Jansz, who is to give
orders to her steersmen in accordance with its purport:</p>

<p>The officers of the Flute Zeehaan are hereby enjoined to set
down in their daily journals this land which we saw and came near
to yesterday in the longitude of 163 degrees 50 minutes, seeing
that we have found this to be its average longitude, and to lay
down the said longitude as an established point of departure for
their further reckonings; he who before this had got the longitude
of 160 degrees or more will henceforth have to take this land for
his starting-point; we make the arrangement in order to preclude
all errors as much as is at all possible. The officers of the
Zeehaan are requested to give orders in conformity to her steersmen
and to see them acted up to, because we opine this to be their
duty; any charts that should be drawn up of this part will have to
lay down this land in the average longitude of 163 degrees 50
minutes as hereinbefore stated.</p>

<p>Actum Heemskerk datum ut supra (signed)</p>

<p>ABEL JANSZ. TASMAN.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude estimated 43 degrees 36 minutes South,
Longitude 163 degrees 2 minutes; course kept south-south-west,
sailed 18 miles. We had 1/2 degree North-West variation; in the
evening the wind went round to the north-east, and we changed our
course to east-south-east.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>In the morning we again saw the coast, our course still being
east-south-east. At noon Latitude estimated 44 degrees 4 minutes
South, Longitude 164 degrees 2 minutes; course kept south-east by
east, sailed 13 miles; the weather was drizzly, foggy, hazy and
rainy, the wind north-east and north-north-east with a light
breeze; at night when 7 glasses of the first watch had run out we
began trying under reduced sail because we dared not run on owing
to thick darkness.</p>

<p>Item the 28th.</p>

<p>In the morning, the weather still being dark, foggy and rainy,
we again made sail, shaped our course to eastward and afterwards
north-east by north; we saw land north-east and north-north-east of
us and made straight for it; the coast here bears south-east by
east and north-west by west; as far as I can see the land here
falls off to eastward. At noon Latitude estimated 44 degrees 12
minutes, Longitude 165 degrees 2 minutes; course kept west by
south, sailed 11 miles with a north-westerly wind and a light
breeze. In the evening we got near the coast; here near the shore
there are a number of islets of which one in shape resembles a
lion; this islet lies out into the sea at about 3 miles distance
from the mainland; in the evening the wind turned to the east;
during the night we lay a-trying under reduced sail.</p>

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>In the morning we were still near the rock which is like a
lion's head; we had a westerly wind with a top-gallant gale; we
sailed along the coast which here bears east and west; towards noon
we passed two rocks of which the westernmost was like Pedra Branca
off the coast of China; the easternmost was like a tall, obtuse,
square tower, and is at about 4 miles distance from the mainland.
We passed between these rocks and the mainland; at noon Latitude
estimated 43 degrees 53 minutes, Longitude 166 degrees 3 minutes;
course kept east-north-east, sailed 12 miles; we were still running
along the coast. In the evening about 5 o'clock we came before a
bay which seemed likely to afford a good anchorage, upon which we
resolved with our ship's council to run into it, as may be seen
from today's resolution; we had nearly got into the bay when there
arose so strong a gale that we were obliged to take in sail and to
run out to sea again under reduced sail, seeing that it was
impossible to come to anchor in such a storm; in the evening we
resolved to stand out to sea during the night under reduced sail to
avoid being thrown on a lee-shore by the violence of the wind; all
which may in extenso be seen from the resolution aforesaid to which
for briefness sake we beg to refer.</p>

<p>Item the last.</p>

<p>At daybreak we again made for shore, the wind and the current
having driven us so far out to sea that we could barely see the
land; we did our utmost to get near it again and at noon had the
land north-west of us; we now turned the ship's head to westward
with a northerly wind which prevented us from getting close to the
land. At noon Latitude observed 43 degrees 41 minutes, Longitude
168 degrees 3 minutes; course kept east by north, sailed 20 miles
in a storm and with variable weather. The needle points due north
here. Shortly after noon we turned our course to westward with a
strong variable gale; we then turned to the north under reduced
sail.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of December.</p>

<p>In the morning, the weather having become somewhat better, we
set our topsails, the wind blowing from the west-south-west with a
top-gallant gale; we now made for the coast. At noon Latitude
observed 43 degrees 10 minutes, Longitude 167 degrees 55 minutes;
course kept north-north-west, sailed 8 miles, it having fallen a
calm; in the afternoon we hoisted the white flag upon which our
friends of the Zeehaan came on board of us, with whom we resolved
that it would be best and most expedient, wind and weather
permitting, to touch at the land the sooner the better, both to get
better acquainted with its condition and to attempt to procure
refreshments for our own behoof, all which may be more amply seen
from this day's resolution. We then got a breeze from eastward and
made for the coast to ascertain whether it would afford a fitting
anchorage; about one hour after sunset we dropped anchor in a good
harbour, in 22 fathom, white and grey fine sand, a naturally drying
bottom; for all which it behoves us to thank God Almighty with
grateful hearts.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>Early in the morning we sent our Pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz in
command of our pinnace, manned with 4 musketeers and 6 rowers, all
of them furnished with pikes and side-arms, together with the
cock-boat of the Zeehaan with one of her second mates and 6
musketeers in it, to a bay situated north-west of us at upwards of
a mile distance in order to ascertain what facilities (as regards
fresh water, refreshments, timber and the like) may be available
there. About three hours before nightfall the boats came back,
bringing various samples of vegetables which they had seen growing
there in great abundance, some of them in appearance not unlike a
certain plant growing at the Cape of Good Hope and fit to be used
as pot-herbs, and another species with long leaves and a brackish
taste, strongly resembling persil de mer or samphire. The
Pilot-major and the second mate of the Zeehaan made the following
report, to wit:</p>

<p>That they had rowed the space of upwards of a mile round the
said point, where they had found high but level land covered with
vegetation (not cultivated, but growing naturally by the will of
God) abundance of excellent timber, and a gently sloping
watercourse in a barren valley, the said water, though of good
quality, being difficult to procure because the watercourse was so
shallow that the water could be dipped with bowls only.</p>

<p>That they had heard certain human sounds and also sounds nearly
resembling the music of a trump or a small gong not far from them
though they had seen no one.</p>

<p>That they had seen two trees about 2 or 2 1/2 fathom in
thickness measuring from 60 to 65 feet from the ground to the
lowermost branches, which trees bore notches made with flint
implements, the bark having been removed for the purpose; these
notches, forming a kind of steps to enable persons to get up the
trees and rob the birds' nests in their tops, were fully 5 feet
apart so that our men concluded that the natives here must be of
very tall stature, or must be in possession of some sort of
artifice for getting up the said trees; in one of the trees these
notched steps were so fresh and new that they seemed to have been
cut less than four days ago.</p>

<p>That on the ground they had observed certain footprints of
animals, not unlike those of a tiger's claws; they also brought on
board certain specimens of animals excrements voided by quadrupeds,
so far as they could surmise and observe, together with a small
quantity of gum of a seemingly very fine quality which had exuded
from trees and bore some resemblance to gum-lac.</p>

<p>That round the eastern point of this bay they had sounded 13 or
14 feet at high water, there being about 3 feet at low tide.</p>

<p>That at the extremity of the said point they had seen large
numbers of gulls, wild ducks and geese, but had perceived none
farther inward though they had heard their cries; and had found no
fish except different kinds of mussels forming small clusters in
several places.&nbsp; That the land is pretty generally covered
with trees standing so far apart that they allow a passage
everywhere and a lookout to a great distance so that, when landing,
our men could always get sight of natives or wild beasts,
unhindered by dense shrubbery or underwood, which would prove a
great advantage in exploring the country.</p>

<p>That in the interior they had in several places observed
numerous trees which had deep holes burnt into them at the upper
end of the foot, while the earth had here and there been dug out
with the fist so as to form a fireplace, the surrounding soil
having become as hard as flint through the action of the fire.</p>

<p>A short time before we got sight of our boats returning to the
ships, we now and then saw clouds of dense smoke rising up from the
land, which was nearly west by north of us, and surmised this might
be a signal given by our men, because they were so long coming
back, for we had ordered them to return speedily, partly in order
to be made acquainted with what they had seen, and partly that we
might be able to send them to other points if they should find no
profit there, to the end that no precious time might be wasted.
When our men had come on board again we inquired of them whether
they had been there and made a fire, to which they returned a
negative answer, adding however that at various times and points in
the wood they also had seen clouds of smoke ascending. So there can
be no doubt there must be men here of extraordinary stature. This
day we had variable winds from the eastward, but for the greater
part of the day a stiff, steady breeze from the south-east.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>We went to the south-east side of this bay in the same boats as
yesterday with Supercargo Gilsemans and a number of musketeers, the
oarsmen furnished with pikes and side-arms; here we found water, it
is true, but the land is so low-lying that the fresh water was made
salt and brackish by the surf, while the soil is too rocky to allow
of wells being dug; we therefore returned on board and convened the
councils of our two ships with which we have resolved and
determined what is set forth in extenso in today's resolution, to
which for briefness sake we refer. In the afternoon we went to the
south-east side of this bay in the boats aforesaid, having with us
Pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz, Skipper Gerrit Jansz, Isack
Gilsemans, supercargo on board the Zeehaan, subcargo Abraham
Coomans, and our master carpenter Pieter Jacobsz; we carried with
us a pole with the Company's mark carved into it, and a Prince-flag
to be set up there, that those who shall come after us may become
aware that we have been here, and have taken possession of the said
land as our lawful property. When we had rowed about halfway with
our boats it began to blow very stiffly, and the sea ran so high
that the cock-boat of the Zeehaan, in which were seated the
Pilot-major and Mr. Gilsemans, was compelled to pull back to the
ships, while we ran on with our pinnace. When we had come close
inshore in a small inlet which bore west-south-west of the ships
the surf ran so high that we could not get near the shore without
running the risk of having our pinnace dashed to pieces. We then
ordered the carpenter aforesaid to swim to the shore alone with the
pole and the flag, and kept by the wind with our pinnace; we made
him plant the said pole with the flag at top into the earth, about
the centre of the bay near four tall trees easily recognisable and
standing in the form of a crescent, exactly before the one standing
lowest. This tree is burnt in just above the ground, and in reality
taller than the other three, but it seems to be shorter because it
stands lower on the sloping ground; at top, projecting from the
crown, it shows two long dry branches, so symmetrically set with
dry sprigs and twigs that they look like the large antlers of a
stag; by the side of these dry branches, slightly lower down, there
is another bough which is quite green and leaved all round, whose
twigs, owing to their regular proportion, wonderfully embellish the
said bough and make it look like the upper part of a larding-pin.
Our master carpenter, having in the sight of myself, Abel Jansz
Tasman, Skipper Gerrit Jansz, and Subcargo Abraham Coomans,
performed the work entrusted to him, we pulled with our pinnace as
near the shore as we ventured to do; the carpenter aforesaid
thereupon swam back to the pinnace through the surf. This work
having been duly executed we pulled back to the ships, leaving the
above-mentioned as a memorial for those who shall come after us,
and for the natives of this country, who did not show themselves,
though we suspect some of them were at no great distance and
closely watching our proceedings. We made no arrangements for
gathering vegetables since the high seas prevented our men from
getting ashore except by swimming, so that it was impossible to get
anything into the pinnace. During the whole of the day the wind
blew chiefly from the north; in the evening we took the sun's
azimuth and found 3 degrees north-easterly variation of the
compass; at sunset we got a strong gale from the north which by and
by rose to so violent a storm from the north-north-west that we
were compelled to get both our yards in and drop our small
bower-anchor.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>At dawn the storm abated, the weather became less rough and, the
land-wind blowing from the west by north, we hove our bower-anchor;
when we had weighed the said anchor and got it above the water we
found that both the flukes were broken off so far that we hauled
home nothing but the shank; we then weighed the other anchor also
and set sail forthwith in order to pass to north to landward of the
northernmost islands and seek a better watering-place. Here we lay
at anchor in 43 degrees South Latitude, Longitude 167 1/2 degrees;
in the forenoon the wind was westerly. At noon Latitude observed 42
degrees 40 minutes, Longitude 168 degrees, course kept north-east,
sailed 8 miles; in the afternoon the wind turned to the north-west;
we had very variable winds all day; in the evening the wind went
round to west-north-west again with a strong gale, then to west by
north and west-north-west again with a strong gale, then to west by
north and west-north-west once more; we then tacked to northward
and in the evening saw a round mountain bearing north-north-west of
us at about 8 miles distance; course kept to northward very close
to the wind. While sailing out of this bay and all through the day
we saw several columns of smoke ascend along the coast. Here it
would be meet to describe the trend of the coast and the islands
lying off it but we request to be excused for briefness sake and
beg leave to refer to the small chart drawn up of it which we have
appended.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>In the morning, the wind blowing from the north-west by west, we
kept our previous course; the high round mountain which we had seen
the day before now bore due west of us at 6 miles distance; at this
point the land fell off to the north-west so that we could no
longer steer near the coast here, seeing that the wind was almost
ahead. We therefore convened the council and the second mates, with
whom after due deliberation we resolved, and subsequently called
out to the officers of the Zeehaan that, pursuant to the resolution
of the 11th ultimo we should direct our course due east, and on the
said course run on to the full longitude of 195 degrees or the
Salomonis islands, all which will be found set forth in extenso in
this day's resolution. At noon Latitude estimated 41 degrees 34
minutes, Longitude 169 degrees, course kept north-east by north,
sailed 20 miles; we then shaped our course due east for the purpose
of making further discoveries and of avoiding the variable winds
between the trade-wind and the anti-trade-wind; the wind from the
north-west with a steady breeze; during the night the wind from the
west, a brisk steady breeze and good clear weather.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind from the south-west with a light breeze;
at noon we were in Latitude 41 degrees 15 minutes, Longitude 172
degrees 35 minutes; course kept east, sailed 40 miles; the weather
was quite calm and still all the afternoon, the sea running high
from all quarters but especially from the south-west; in the
evening when the watches were setting we got a steady breeze from
the east-north-east and north-east.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>The wind still continuing to blow from the north-east, the
breeze quite as fresh as during the night. At noon Latitude
estimated 42 degrees 13 minutes, Longitude 174 degrees 31 minutes;
course kept south-east by east, sailed 26 miles. Variation
increasing 5 degrees 45 minutes North-West.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>During the night we had a calm, the wind going round to the west
and north-west. At noon Latitude estimated 42 degrees 29 minutes,
Longitude 176 degrees 17 minutes; course kept east by south, sailed
20 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>We drifted in a calm so that by estimation we were carried 3
miles to the south-eastward. At noon Latitude observed 42 degrees
37 minutes, Longitude 176 degrees 29 minutes. Variation 5 degrees.
Towards evening we had a light breeze from the west-north-west.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>Occasional squalls of rain mixed with hail, the wind being
westerly with a top-gallant gale. At noon Latitude observed 42
degrees 45 minutes, Longitude 178 degrees 40 minutes; course kept
east, sailed 24 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>Good weather with a clear sky and a westerly wind with a
top-gallant gale. At noon Latitude observed 42 degrees 48 minutes,
Longitude 181 degrees 51 minutes; course kept east, sailed 38
miles. Variation increasing 7 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>Good weather, the wind blowing from the south-south-west and
south-west with a steady breeze. At noon Latitude observed 42
degrees 38 minutes, Longitude 185 degrees 17 minutes; course kept
east, sailed 38 miles. The heavy swells continuing from the
south-west, there is no mainland to be expected here to southward.
Variation 7 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>Latitude observed 42 degrees 10 minutes, Longitude 188 degrees
28 minutes; course kept east by north, sailed 36 miles in a
south-south-westerly wind with a top-gallant gale. Towards noon we
saw a large, high-lying land, bearing south-east of us at about 15
miles distance; we turned our course to the south-east, making
straight for this land, fired a gun and in the afternoon hoisted
the white flag, upon which the officers of the Zeehaan came on
board of us, with whom we resolved to touch at the said land as
quickly as at all possible, for such reasons as are more amply set
forth in this day's resolution. In the evening we deemed it best
and gave orders accordingly to our steersmen to stick to the
south-east course while the weather keeps quiet but, should the
breeze freshen, to steer due east in order to avoid running on
shore, and to preclude accidents as much as in us lies; since we
opine that the land should not be touched at from this side on
account of the high open sea running there in huge hollow waves and
heavy swells, unless there should happen to be safe land-locked
bays on this side. At the expiration of four glasses of the first
watch we shaped our course due east. Variation 7 degrees 30 minutes
North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>At noon Latitude observed 42 degrees 10 minutes, Longitude 189
degrees 3 minutes; course kept east, sailed 12 miles. We were about
2 miles off the coast, which showed as a very high double land, but
we could not see the summits of the mountains owing to thick
clouds. We shaped our course to northward along the coast, so near
to it that we could constantly see the surf break on the shore. In
the afternoon we took soundings at about 2 miles distance from the
coast in 55 fathom, a sticky sandy soil, after which it fell a
calm. Towards evening we saw a low-lying point north-east by north
of us, at about 3 miles distance; the greater part of the time we
were drifting in a calm towards the said point; in the middle of
the afternoon we took soundings in 45 fathom, a sticky sandy
bottom. The whole night we drifted in a calm, the sea running from
the west-north-west, so that we got near the land in 28 fathom,
good anchoring-ground, where, on account of the calm, and for fear
of drifting nearer to the shore, we ran out our kedge-anchor during
the day-watch, and we are now waiting for the land-wind.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>In the morning with a light breeze blowing from the land we
weighed anchor and did our best to run out to sea a little, our
course being north-west by north; we then had the northernmost
low-lying point of the day before, north-north-east and north-east
by north of us. This land consists of a high double mountain-range,
not lower than Ilha Formoza. At noon Latitude observed 41 degrees
40 minutes, Longitude 189 degrees 49 minutes; course kept
north-north-east, sailed 8 miles; the point we had seen the day
before now lay south-east of us, at 2 1/2 miles distance; northward
from this point extends a large rocky reef; on this reef,
projecting from the sea, there are a number of high steep cliffs
resembling steeples or sails; one mile west of this point we could
sound no bottom. As we still saw this high land extend to
north-north-east of us we from here held our course due north with
good, dry weather and smooth water. From the said low point with
the cliffs, the land makes a large curve to the north-east,
trending first due east, and afterwards due north again. The point
aforesaid is in Latitude 41 degrees 50 minutes south. The wind was
blowing from the west. It was easy to see here that in these parts
the land must be very desolate; we saw no human beings nor any
smoke rising; nor can the people here have any boats, since we did
not see any signs of them; in the evening we found 8 degrees
North-East variation of the compass.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>At six glasses before the day we took soundings in 60 fathom
anchoring-ground. The northernmost point we had in sight then bore
from us north-east by east, at three miles distance, and the
nearest land lay south-east of us at 1 1/2 miles distance. We
drifted in a calm, with good weather and smooth water; at noon
Latitude observed 40 degrees 58 minutes, average Longitude 189
degrees 54 minutes; course kept north-north-east, sailed 11 miles;
we drifted in a calm the whole afternoon; in the evening at sunset
we had 9 degrees 23 minutes increasing North-East variation; the
wind then went round to south-west with a freshening breeze; we
found the furthest point of the land that we could see to bear from
us east by north, the land falling off so abruptly there that we
did not doubt that this was the farthest extremity. We now convened
our council with the second mates, with whom we resolved to run
north-east and east-north-east till the end of the first watch, and
then to sail near the wind, wind and weather not changing, as may
in extenso be seen from this day's resolution. During the night in
the sixth glass it fell calm again so that we stuck to the
east-north-east course; although in the fifth glass of the
dog-watch, we had the point we had seen in the evening, south-east
of us, we could not sail higher than east-north-east slightly
easterly owing to the sharpness of the wind; in the first watch we
took soundings once, and a second time in the dog-watch, in 60
fathom, clean, grey sand. In the second glass of the day-watch we
got a breeze from the south-east, upon which we tacked for the
shore again.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>In the morning at sunrise we were about one mile from the shore;
in various places we saw smoke ascending from fires made by the
natives; the wind then being south and blowing from the land we
again tacked to eastward. At noon Latitude estimated 40 degrees 31
minutes, Longitude 190 degrees 47 minutes; course kept north-east
by east, sailed 12 miles; in the afternoon the wind being west we
held our course east by south along a low-lying shore with dunes in
good dry weather; we sounded in 30 fathom, black sand, so that by
night one had better approach this land aforesaid, sounding; we
then made for this sandy point until we got in 17 fathom, where we
cast anchor at sunset owing to a calm, when we had the northern
extremity of this dry sandspit west by north of us; also high land
extending to east by south; the point of the reef south-east of us;
here inside this point or narrow sandspit we saw a large open bay
upward of 3 or 4 miles wide; to eastward of this narrow sandspit
there is a sandbank upwards of a mile in length with 6, 7, 8 and 9
feet of water above it, and projecting east-south-east from the
said point. In the evening we had 9 degrees North-East
variation.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>In the morning we weighed anchor in calm weather; at noon
Latitude estimated 40 degrees 49 minutes, Longitude 191 degrees 41
minutes; course kept east-south-east, sailed 11 miles. In the
morning before weighing anchor, we had resolved with the Officers
of the Zeehaan that we should try to get ashore here and find a
good harbour; and that as we neared it we should send out the
pinnace to reconnoitre; all which may in extenso be seen from this
day's resolution. In the afternoon our skipper Ide Tiercxz and our
pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz, in the pinnace, and Supercargo
Gilsemans, with one of the second mates of the Zeehaan in the
latter's cock-boat, went on before to seek a fitting anchorage and
a good watering-place. At sunset when it fell a calm we dropped
anchor in 15 fathom, good anchoring-ground in the evening, about an
hour after sunset, we saw a number of lights on shore and four
boats close inshore, two of which came towards us, upon which our
own two boats returned on board; they reported that they had found
no less than 13 fathom water and that, when the sun sank behind the
high land, they were still about half a mile from shore. When our
men had been on board for the space of about one glass the men in
the two prows began to call out to us in the rough, hollow voice,
but we could not understand a word of what they said. We however
called out to them in answer, upon which they repeated their cries
several times, but came no nearer than a stone shot; they also blew
several times on an instrument of which the sound was like that of
a Moorish trumpet; we then ordered one of our sailors (who had some
knowledge of trumpet-blowing) to play them some tunes in answer.
Those on board the Zeehaan ordered their second mate (who had come
out to India as a trumpeter and had in the Mauritius been appointed
second mate by the council of that fortress and the ships) to do
the same; after this had been repeated several times on both sides,
and as it was getting more and more dark, those in the native prows
at last ceased and paddled off. For more security and to be on
guard against all accidents we ordered our men to keep double
watches as we are wont to do when out at sea, and to keep in
readiness all necessaries of war, such as muskets, pikes and
cutlasses. We cleaned the guns on the upper-orlop, and placed them
again, in order to prevent surprises, and be able to defend
ourselves if these people should happen to attempt anything against
us. Variation 9 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>Early in the morning a boat manned with 13 natives approached to
about a stone's cast from our ships; they called out several times
but we did not understand them, their speech not bearing any
resemblance to the vocabulary given us by the Honourable
Governor-General and Councillors of India, which is hardly to be
wondered at, seeing that it contains the language of the Salomonis
islands, etc. As far as we could observe these people were of
ordinary height; they had rough voices and strong bones, the colour
of their skin being brown and yellow; they wore tufts of black hair
right upon the top of their heads, tied fast in the manner of the
Japanese at the back of their heads, but somewhat longer and
thicker, and surmounted by a large, thick white feather. Their
boats consisted of two long narrow prows side by side, over which a
number of planks or other seats were placed in such a way that
those above can look through the water underneath the vessel: their
paddles are upwards of a fathom in length, narrow and pointed at
the end; with these vessels they could make considerable speed. For
clothing, as it seemed to us, some of them wore mats, others cotton
stuffs; almost all of them were naked from the shoulders to the
waist. We repeatedly made signs for them to come on board of us,
showing them white linen and some knives that formed part of our
cargo. They did not come nearer, however, but at last paddled back
to shore. In the meanwhile, at our summons sent the previous
evening, the officers of the Zeehaan came on board of us, upon
which we convened a council and resolved to go as near the shore as
we could, since there was good anchoring-ground here, and these
people apparently sought our friendship. Shortly after we had drawn
up this resolution we saw 7 more boats put off from the shore, one
of which (high and pointed in front, manned with 17 natives)
paddled round behind the Zeehaan while another, with 13 able-bodied
men in her, approached to within half a stone's throw of our ship;
the men in these two boats now and then called out to each other;
we held up and showed them as before white linens, etc., but they
remained where they were. The skipper of the Zeehaan now sent out
to them his quartermaster with her cock-boat with six paddlers in
it, with orders for the second mates that, if these people should
offer to come alongside the Zeehaan, they should not allow too many
of them on board of her, but use great caution and be well on their
guard. While the cock-boat of the Zeehaan was paddling on its way
to her those in the prow nearest to us called out to those who were
lying behind the Zeehaan and waved their paddles to them, but we
could not make out what they meant. Just as the cock-boat of the
Zeehaan had put off from board again those in the prow before us,
between the two ships, began to paddle so furiously towards it
that, when they were about halfway slightly nearer to our ship,
they struck the Zeehaan's cock-boat so violently alongside with the
stem of their prow that it got a violent lurch, upon which the
foremost man in this prow of villains with a long, blunt pike
thrust the quartermaster Cornelis Joppen in the neck several times
with so much force that the poor man fell overboard. Upon this the
other natives, with short thick clubs which we at first mistook for
heavy blunt parangs, and with their paddles, fell upon the men in
the cock-boat and overcame them by main force, in which fray three
of our men were killed and a fourth got mortally wounded through
the heavy blows. The quartermaster and two sailors swam to our
ship, whence we had sent our pinnace to pick them up, which they
got into alive. After this outrageous and detestable crime the
murderers sent the cock-boat adrift, having taken one of the dead
bodies into their prow and thrown another into the sea. Ourselves
and those on board the Zeehaan seeing this, diligently fired our
muskets and guns and, although we did not hit any of them, the two
prows made haste to the shore, where they were out of the reach of
shot. With our fore upper-deck and bow guns we now fired several
shots in the direction of their prows, but none of them took
effect. There upon our skipper Ide Tercxsen Holman, in command of
our pinnace well manned and armed, rowed towards the cock-boat of
the Zeehaan (which fortunately for us these accursed villains had
let adrift) and forthwith returned with it to our ships, having
found in it one of the men killed and one mortally wounded. We now
weighed anchor and set sail, since we could not hope to enter into
any friendly relations with these people, or to be able to get
water or refreshments here. Having weighed anchor and being under
sail, we saw 22 prows near the shore, of which eleven, swarming
with people, were making for our ships. We kept quiet until some of
the foremost were within reach of our guns, and then fired 1 or 2
shots from the gun-room with our pieces, without however doing them
any harm; those on board the Zeehaan also fired, and in the largest
prow hit a man who held a small white flag in his hand, and who
fell down. We also heard the canister-shot strike the prows inside
and outside, but could not make out what other damage it had done.
As soon as they had got this volley they paddled back to shore with
great speed, two of them hoisting a sort of tingang sails. They
remained lying near the shore without visiting us any further.
About noon skipper Gerrit Jansz and Mr. Gilsemans again came on
board of us; we also sent for their first mate and convened the
council, with whom we drew up the resolution following, to wit:
Seeing that the detestable deed of these natives against four men
of the Zeehaan's crew, perpetrated this morning, must teach us to
consider the inhabitants of this country as enemies; that therefore
it will be best to sail eastward along the coast, following the
trend of the land in order to ascertain whether there are any
fitting places where refreshments and water would be obtainable;
all of which will be found set forth in extenso in this day's
resolution. In this murderous spot (to which we have accordingly
given the name of Murderers' Bay) we lay at anchor on 40 degrees 50
minutes South Latitude, 191 degrees 30 minutes Longitude. From here
we shaped our course east-north-east. At noon Latitude estimated 40
degrees 57 minutes, Longitude 191 degrees 41 minutes; course kept
south, sailed 2 miles. In the afternoon we got the wind from the
west-north-west when, on the advice of our steersmen and with our
own approval, we turned our course north-east by north. During the
night we kept sailing as the weather was favourable, but about an
hour after midnight we sounded in 25 or 26 fathom, a hard, sandy
bottom. Soon after the wind went round to north-west, and we
sounded in 15 fathom; we forthwith tacked to await the day, turning
our course to westward, exactly contrary to the direction by which
we had entered. Variation 9 degrees 30 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>This is the second land which we have sailed along and
discovered. In honour of their High Mightinesses the States-General
we gave Staten Land, since we deemed it quite possible that this
land is part of the great Staten Land, though this is not certain.
This land seems to be a very fine country and we trust that this is
the mainland coast of the unknown South land. To this course we
have given the name of Abel Tasman passage, because he has been the
first to navigate it.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>In the morning we saw land lying here on all sides of us, so
that we must have sailed at least 30 miles into a bay. We had at
first thought that the land off which we had anchored was an
island, nothing doubting that we should here find a passage to the
open South Sea; but to our grievous disappointment it proved quite
otherwise. The wind now being westerly we henceforth did our best
by tacking to get out at the same passage through which we had come
in. At noon Latitude observed 40 degrees 51 minutes South,
Longitude 192 degrees 55 minutes; course kept east half a point
northerly, sailed 14 miles. In the afternoon it fell calm. The sea
ran very strong into this bay so that we would make no headway but
drifted back into it with the tide. At noon we tacked to northward
when we saw a round high islet west by south of us, at about 8
miles distance which we had passed the day before; the said island
lying about 6 miles east of the place where we had been at anchor
and in the same latitude. This bay into which we had sailed so far
by mistake showed us everywhere a fine good land: near the shore
the land was mainly low and barren, the inland being moderately
high. As you are approaching the land you have everywhere an
anchoring-ground gradually rising from 50 or 60 fathom to 15 fathom
when you are still fully 1 1/2 or 2 miles from shore. At three
o'clock in the afternoon we got a light breeze from the south-east
but as the sea was very rough we made little or no progress. During
the night we drifted in a calm; in the second watch, the wind being
westerly, we tacked to northward.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>During the night in the dog-watch we had a westerly wind with a
strong breeze; we steered to the north, hoping that the land which
we had had north-west of us the day before might fall away to
northward, but after the cook had dished we again ran against it
and found that it still extended to the north-west. We now tacked,
turning from the land again and, as it began to blow fresh, we ran
south-west over towards the south shore. At noon, Latitude observed
40 degrees 31 minutes, Longitude 192 degrees 55 minutes; course
kept north, sailed 5 miles. The weather was hazy so that we could
not see land. Halfway through the afternoon we again saw the south
coast; the island which the day before we had west of us at about 6
miles distance now lay south-west by south of us at about 4 miles
distance. We made for it, running on until the said island was
north-north-west of us, then dropped our anchor behind a number of
cliffs in 33 fathom, sandy ground mixed with shells. There are many
islands and cliffs all round here. We struck our sail-yards for it
was blowing a storm from the north-west and west-north-west.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>The wind north-west by north and blowing so hard that there was
no question of going under sail in order to make any progress; we
found it difficult enough for the anchor to hold. We therefore set
to refitting our ship. We are lying here in 40 degrees 50 minutes
South Latitude and Longitude 192 degrees 37 minutes; course held
south-west by south, sailed 6 miles. During the night we got the
wind so hard from the north-west that we had to strike our tops and
drop another anchor. The Zeehaan was almost forced from her anchor
and therefore hove out another anchor likewise.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>The weather still dark, hazy and drizzling; the wind north-west
and west-north-west with a storm so that to our great regret we
could not make any headway.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>Still rough, unsteady weather, the wind still north-west and
stormy; in the morning when there was a short calm we hoisted the
white flag and got the officers of the Zeehaan on board of us. We
then represented to them that since the tide was running from the
south-east there was likely to be a passage through, so that
perhaps it would be best, as soon as wind and weather should
permit, to investigate this point and see whether we could get
fresh water there; all of which may in extenso be seen from the
resolution drawn up concerning this matter.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>In the morning we reset our tops and sailyards, but out at sea
things looked still so gloomy that we did not venture to weigh our
anchor. Towards evening it fell a calm so that we took in part of
our cable. Item the 26th.</p>

<p>In the morning, two hours before day, we got the wind
east-north-east with a light breeze. We weighed anchor and set
sail, steered our course to northward, intending to sail northward
round this land; at daybreak it began to drizzle, the wind went
round to the south-east, and afterwards to the south as far as the
south-west, with a stiff breeze. We had soundings in 60 fathom, and
set our course by the wind to westward. At noon Latitude estimated
40 degrees 13 minutes, Longitude 192 degrees 7 minutes; course kept
north-north-west, sailed 20 miles. Variation 8 degrees 40 minutes.
During the night we lay to with small sail.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>In the morning at daybreak we made sail again, set our course to
northward, the wind being south-west with a steady breeze; at noon
Latitude observed 38 degrees 38 minutes, Longitude 190 degrees 15
minutes; course kept north-west, sailed 26 miles. At noon we shaped
our course north-east. During the night we lay to under small sail.
Variation 8 degrees 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 28th.</p>

<p>In the morning at daybreak we made sail again, set our course to
eastward in order to ascertain whether the land we had previously
seen in 40 degrees extends still further northward, or whether it
falls away to eastward. At noon we saw east by north of us a high
mountain which we at first took to be an island; but afterwards we
observed that it forms part of the mainland. We were then about 5
miles from shore and took soundings in 50 fathom, fine sand mixed
with clay. This high mountain is in 38 degrees South Latitude. So
far as I could observe this coast extends south and north. It fell
a calm, but when there came a light breeze from the
north-north-east we tacked to the north-west. At noon Latitude
estimated 38 degrees 2 minutes, Longitude 192 degrees 23 minutes;
course held north-east by east, sailed 16 miles. Towards the
evening the wind went round to north-east and north-east by east,
stiffening more and more, so that at the end of the first watch we
had to take in our topsails. Variation 8 degrees 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>In the morning at daybreak we took in our bonnets and had to
lower our foresail down to the stem. At noon Latitude estimated 37
degrees 17 minutes, Longitude 191 degrees 26 minutes; towards noon
we again set our foresail and then tacked to westward, course kept
north-west, sailed 16 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 30th.</p>

<p>In the morning, the weather having somewhat improved, we set our
topsails and slid out our bonnets. We had the Zeehaan to lee of us,
tacked and made towards her. We then had the wind west-north-west
with a top-gallant gale. At noon Latitude observed 37 degrees,
Longitude 191 degrees 55 minutes; course held north-east, sailed 7
miles. Towards evening we again saw the land bearing from us
north-east and north-north-east, on which account we steered north
and north-east. Variation 8 degrees 40 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the last.</p>

<p>At noon we tacked about to northward, the wind being
west-north-west with a light breeze. At noon Latitude observed 36
degrees 45 minutes, Longitude 191 degrees 46 minutes; course kept
north-west, sailed 7 miles. In the evening we were about 3 miles
from shore; at the expiration of 4 glasses in the first watch we
again tacked to the north; during the night we threw the lead in 80
fathom. This coast here extends south-east and north-west; the land
is high in some places and covered with dunes in others. Variation
8 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of January.</p>

<p>In the morning we drifted in a calm along the coast which here
still stretched north-west and south-east. The coast here is level
and even, without reefs or shoals. At noon we were in Latitude 36
degrees 12 minutes, Longitude 191 degrees 7 minutes; course kept
north-west, sailed 10 miles. About noon the wind came from the
south-south-east and south-east; we now shaped our course
west-north-west in order to keep off shore since there was a heavy
surf running. Variation 8 degrees 30 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>Calm weather. Halfway through the afternoon we got a breeze from
the east; we directed our course to the north-north-west; at the
end of the first watch, however, we turned our course to the
north-west so as not to come too near the shore and prevent
accidents, seeing that in the evening we had the land
north-north-west of us. At noon we were in Latitude 35 degrees 55
minutes, Longitude 190 degrees 47 minutes; course kept north-west
by west, sailed 7 miles. Variation 9 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>In the morning we saw the land east by north of us at about 6
miles distance and were surprised to find ourselves so far from
shore. At noon Latitude observed 35 degrees 20 minutes, Longitude
190 degrees 17 minutes, course held north-west by north, sailed 11
miles. At noon the wind went round to the south-south-east, upon
which we steered our course east-north-east to get near the shore
again. In the evening we saw land north and east-south-east of
us.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>In the morning we found ourselves near a cape, and had an island
north-west by north of us, upon which we hoisted the white flag for
the Officers of the Zeehaan to come on board of us, with whom we
resolved to touch at the island aforesaid to see if we could there
get fresh water, vegetables, etc. At noon Latitude observed 34
degrees 35 minutes, Longitude 191 degrees 9 minutes; course kept
north-east, sailed 15 miles, with the wind south-east. Towards noon
we drifted in a calm and found ourselves in the midst of a very
heavy current which drove us to the westward. There was besides a
heavy sea running from the north-east here, which gave us great
hopes of finding a passage here. This cape which we had
east-north-east of us is in 34 degrees 30 minutes South Latitude.
The land here falls away to eastward. In the evening we sent to the
Zeehaan the pilot-major with the secretary, as we were close to
this island and, so far as we could see, were afraid there would be
nothing there of what we were in want of; we therefore asked the
opinion of the officers of the Zeehaan whether it would not be best
to run on, if we should get a favourable wind during the night,
which the officers of the Zeehaan fully agreed with. Variation 8
degrees 40 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>In the morning we still drifted in a calm, but about 9 o'clock
we got a slight breeze from the south-east, whereupon with our
friends of the Zeehaan we deemed it expedient to steer our course
for the island before mentioned. About noon we sent to the said
island our pinnace with the pilot-major, together with the
cock-boat of the Zeehaan with Supercargo Gilsemans in it, in order
to find out whether there was any fresh water to be obtained there.
Towards the evening they returned on board and reported that,
having come near the land, they had paid close attention to
everything and had &nbsp;taken due precautions against sudden
surprises or assaults on the part of the natives; that they had
entered a safe but small bay, where they had found good fresh
water, coming in great plenty from a steep mountain, but that,
owing to the heavy surf on the shore, it was highly dangerous, nay
well-nigh impossible for us to get water there, that therefore they
pulled farther round the said island, trying to find some other
more convenient water-place elsewhere, that on the said land they
saw in several places on the highest hills from 30 to 35 persons,
men of tall stature, so far as they could see from a distance,
armed with sticks or clubs, who called out to them in a very loud,
rough voice, certain words which our men could not understand; that
these persons, in walking on, took enormous steps or strides. As
our men were rowing about some few in number now and then showed
themselves on the hill-tops, from which our men very credibly
concluded that these natives in this way generally keep in
readiness their assegais, boats and small arms, after their wonted
fashions; so that it may fairly be inferred that few, if any, more
persons inhabit the said island than those who showed themselves;
for in rowing round the island our men nowhere saw any dwellings or
cultivated land except just by the fresh water above referred to,
where higher up on both sides the running water they saw everywhere
square beds looking green and pleasant, but owing to the great
distance they could not discern what kind of vegetables they were.
It is quite possible that all these persons had their dwellings
near the said fresh water. In the bay aforesaid they also saw two
prows hauled on shore, one of them seaworthy, the other broken, but
they nowhere saw any other craft. Our men having returned on board
with the pinnace, we forthwith did our best to get near the shore,
and in the evening we anchored in 40 fathom, good bottom, at a
small swivel-gun-shot distance from the coast. We forthwith made
preparations for taking in water the next day. The said island is
in 34 degrees 25 minutes South Latitude and 190 degrees 40 minutes
average Longitude.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>Early in the morning we sent to the watering-place the two
boats, to wit ours and the cock-boat of the Zeehaan, each furnished
with two pederaroes, 6 musketeers, and the rowers with pikes and
side-arms, together with our pinnace with the pilot-major Francoys
Jacobsz and skipper Gerrit Jansz, with casks for getting fresh
water. While rowing towards the shore they saw, in various places
on the heights, a tall man standing with a long stick like a pike,
apparently watching our men. As they were rowing past he had called
out to them in a very loud voice; when they had got about halfway
to the watering-place, between a certain point and another large
high rock or small island, they found the current to run so
strongly against the wind that, with the empty boats, they had to
do their utmost to hold their own; for which reason the pilot-major
and Gerrit Jansz, skipper of the Zeehaan, agreed together to
abstain from exposing the small craft and the men to such great
peril, seeing that there was still a long voyage before them and
the men and the small craft were greatly wanted by the ships. They
therefore pulled back to the ships, the rather as a heavy surf was
rolling on the shore near the watering-place. The breeze
freshening, we could easily surmise that they had not been able to
land, and now made a sign to them from our ship with the furled
flag, and fired a gun to let them know that they were at liberty to
return, but they were already on their way back before we signalled
to them. The pilot-major, having come alongside our ship again with
the boats, reported that owing to the wind the attempt to land
there was too dangerous, seeing that the sea was everywhere near
the shore full of hard rocks without any sandy ground, so that they
would have greatly imperilled the men and run the risk of having
the water-casks injured or stove in; we forthwith summoned the
officers of the Zeehaan and the second mates on board of us, and
convened a council in which it was resolved to weigh anchor
directly and to run on an easterly course as far as 220 degrees
Longitude, in accordance with the preceding resolution; then to
shape our course to northward, or eventually due north, as far as
Latitude 17 degrees South, after which we shall hold our course due
west in order to run straight of the Cocos and Hoorense islands,
where we shall take in fresh water and refreshments; or if we
should meet with any other island before these we shall endeavour
to touch at them, in order to ascertain what can be obtained there;
all this being duly specified and set forth at length in this day's
resolution, to which for briefness sake we beg leave to refer.
About noon we set sail; at noon we had the island due south of us
at about 3 miles distance; in the evening at sunset it was
south-south-west of us at 6 or 7 miles distance, the island and the
rocks lying south-west and north-east of each other. During the
night it was pretty calm with an east-south-east wind, our course
being north-north-east, very close to the wind, while the tide was
running in from the north-east.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>Good weather, the wind blowing from east by south and
east-south-east with a topsail breeze; at noon Latitude observed 33
degrees 25 minutes, Longitude 191 degrees 9 minutes; course kept
north-east, sailed 16 miles. The sea is running very high from the
eastward, so that in the direction there is not likely to be any
mainland. Variation 8 degrees 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>During the night we had good weather, in the forenoon fog and
drizzling rain; during the whole of these twenty-four hours we had
the wind from south-east, with a top-gallant gale. At noon Latitude
observed 32 degrees 25 minutes, Longitude 192 degrees 20 minutes;
course kept north-east, sailed 21 miles. The great swells now come
from the south-east. This passage from Batavia to Chili is in
smooth water so that there is no objection to following it; we
shall hereafter describe this passage in a series of sailing
instructions, but at present must omit doing so for valid reasons.
Variation 9 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>We had variable easterly winds with a light breeze. At noon
Latitude estimated 34 degrees 4 minutes, Longitude 192 degrees 43
minutes; course kept north-east, sailed 7 miles; at night we
drifted in a calm.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>In the forenoon it continued calm with a light breeze from the
east; at noon Latitude observed 31 degrees 28 minutes, Longitude
192 degrees 43 minutes; course held north, sailed 9 miles; in the
afternoon the wind blew from the east-north-east with a light
top-gallant breeze, our course still being over to northward close
to the wind. In the evening at sunset the wind went round to north
by east so that we had to tack to eastward. Variation 10 degrees 20
minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>The wind still northerly with a light topsail breeze, seas
running from the east-south-east and from the south-west at the
same time against each other. At noon Latitude estimated 31 degrees
10 minutes south, Longitude 193 degrees 35 minutes; course kept
east-north-east, sailed 12 miles. In the afternoon the wind turning
to the north-north-west we changed our course to east-north-east;
in the evening the wind went round again to west-south-west with a
squall of rain, upon which we shaped our course north-eastward.
Variation 10 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>The wind west-south-west with a topsail breeze, seas still
running against each other, both from south-west and south-east. At
noon Latitude observed 30 degrees 5 minutes, Longitude 195 degrees
27 minutes; course kept north-east by east, sailed 29 miles;
towards evening the wind turned to the west. Variation 9 degrees 30
minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>Good weather with a clear sky and a westerly wind with a light
topsail breeze; at noon Latitude observed 29 degrees 10 minutes,
Longitude 196 degrees 32 minutes; course kept north-east, sailed 20
miles; the sea keeps running from the south-west and south-east; in
the evening 9 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>In the morning we had the wind from the south with a light
breeze, the sea still running high both from the south-west and
from the south-east as well. At noon Latitude observed 28 degrees
40 minutes, Longitude 197 degrees 5 minutes; course kept
north-east, sailed 10 miles; at noon the wind went round to the
south-east with a slackening breeze. Up to now we have had westerly
winds. Variation 8 degrees 30 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>Good weather, the sea running from the south-west is beginning
to smooth, so that the swells from the south-west have abated a
good deal, but the sea is still running strong from the south-east.
At noon Latitude estimated 27 degrees 43 minutes, Longitude 198
degrees 9 minutes; course kept north-east, sailed 20 miles; the
wind being south-south-east with a light topsail breeze. According
to my estimation we are now 105 miles east of the Salomonis islands
but only 62 miles according to the average of our longitude.
Variation 8 degrees 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>Good weather with a clear sky and the wind blowing from the
eastward; the sea still running in from all sides; we had a light
topsail breeze. At noon Latitude observed 26 degrees 29 minutes,
Longitude 199 degrees 32 minutes; course kept north-east, sailed 26
miles. In the evening the wind turned to the south-east.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>Good weather, with the wind from the south-east, and trade-wind
weather. At noon Latitude observed 25 degrees 20 minutes, Longitude
200 degrees 50 minutes; course kept north-east, sailed 25 miles in
smooth water. Variation 8 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>Good weather with a grey sky and trade-wind weather, the wind
blowing from the south with a light topsail breeze. At noon
Latitude estimated 24 degrees 18 minutes South, Longitude 201
degrees 45 minutes; course kept north-east and north-east by north,
sailed 20 miles with small showers now and then.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>Good weather; the wind south-east with a steady trade-wind and
smooth water. At noon Latitude observed 22 degrees 46 minutes,
Longitude 203 degrees 27 minutes; course kept north-east, sailed 33
miles. About two o'clock in the afternoon we saw land bearing from
us east by north, at about 8 miles distance. We held our course
towards it but could not make it owing to the sharpness of the
wind. This island bears a resemblance to two women's breasts when
it bears from you east by north at 6 miles distance, and is
situated in 22 degrees 35 minutes South Latitude and 204 degrees 15
minutes Longitude. It is not large, about 2 or 3 miles in
circumference, and to the view appears a high and barren island. We
should have greatly liked to sail close along it in order to
ascertain whether we should have any chance of getting fresh water
or refreshments there, but we could not get nearer to it on account
of the sharpness of the wind; we tacked close to the wind. Seeing
that in the great chart of the South Sea there are 4 islands
situated in this latitude, I am inclined to believe that this is
one of them. Variation 7 degrees 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>In the morning at sunrise we still saw the island which we had
seen the day before; it now lay south-south-west of us at about 6
miles distance; to this island we have given the name of Hooge
Pylstaerts island because there were so many pylstaerten
(tropic-birds) about it. We had a south-east and south-east by
south wind, with trade-wind weather and a topsail breeze. At noon
Latitude observed 21 degrees 50 minutes, Longitude 204 degrees 45
minutes; course kept north-east by east, sailed 24 miles. About one
o'clock in the afternoon we saw land, bearing from us east at about
8 miles distance; we steered our course for it, and at night lay to
with small sail. Variation 7 degrees 15 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>In the morning we had a calm; we had the southernmost island
east by south of us at about five miles distance; we shaped our
course for the northernmost island which is in 21 degrees 50
minutes South Latitude, Longitude 205 degrees 29 minutes, and
sailed to the north-west of the island where we dropped anchor in
25 fathom, coral bottom. The place where we came to anchor is in 21
degrees 20 minutes South Latitude and Longitude 205 degrees 29
minutes. These two islands are nearly south-east and north-west of
each other; we could see through between them, where there was a
passage about 1 1/2 mile in width. The one to the south-east was
the highest, the northernmost one being a low-lying island, much
like Holland. To the northernmost we gave the name of Amsterdam
because of the abundance of refreshments we got there, and the
southernmost we christened Middleburch. At noon a small prow with
three men in it put off from land and came near our ship; these men
were naked, of a brown colour and slightly above the ordinary
stature; two of them had long, thick hair on their heads, the third
wore his close cut; they had only their privities covered with a
curious small bit of cloth; their prow was a very narrow one,
covered in to a good distance in front and abaft; their paddles
were of ordinary length, with blades broad in the middle; they
called out to us several times, to which we responded in the same
way, but we could not understand each other. We showed them white
linen, throwing overboard a piece upwards of 1 1/2 fathom in
length, which they seeing paddled towards it, but as it had sunk to
a considerable depth under the water the foremost man in the prow
jumped out and dived for it. He remained under water for a very
long time, but at last reappeared with the linen and got into the
prow again, where he put it several times atop of his head, in sign
of gratitude. They then gradually approached us with their prow,
upon which we threw out to them a piece of wood to which we had
fastened two large nails; we then handed out to them a small
Chinese looking-glass with a string of Chinese beads, which they
drew up into their prow by means of a long stick, to which they
tied one of their fish-hooks with a small fishing-line, which they
handed up to us to show their gratitude. This fish-hook was made of
mother-of-pearl and shaped like a small anchovy. They repeatedly
put the string of beads and the looking-glass on their heads; the
middlemost man in the prow tied the nails round his neck, but as
the looking-glass was closed with a slide they could not see
themselves in it. We therefore handed down another to them which
they looked into, and laid on their heads. We now showed them an
old coconut and a fowl, and with aid of our vocabulary inquired
after water, hogs, etc.; they did not understand us nor we them,
but they constantly kept pointing to the shore. When we had made
them a present of the objects aforementioned, and had shown them
the coconut and the fowl, they at last paddled back to shore again
and made signs to us, as if they were going to fetch the like from
shore. At noon and in the afternoon we saw numbers of people
walking along the shore, some of them with small white flags which
we surmised to be signs of peace and amity. We therefore also
hoisted our white flag astern, upon which there came alongside our
ship a small prow with four persons in it; they were able-bodied
men, having their bodies painted black from the waist to the
thighs, their necks hung round with leaves; they carried a small
white flag and a cloth made of the bark of trees. They fastened the
said flag to the stem of our boat. The outriggers of their prow
were trimmed with shells and conches. From these presents and from
the embellishments of their prow, which seemed to be distinguished
above the others, we concluded that this prow had been sent off by
the king or chief of the country. We therefore presented these men
with a small Chinese looking-glass, a knife, a piece of dungaree,
and one or two nails. We filled a rummer of wine for them, from
which we first drank ourselves lest they should think we were going
to poison them or do them other harm; having taken the rummer they
poured out the wine and took the rummer on shore with them. Shortly
afterwards a great number of prows came alongside, some of them
with 5 or 6, others with 10 or 12 coconuts, all of which we
bartered against old nails; three or four coconuts against a double
middle-sized nail. Some of them came swimming from the land with
coconuts, all of which we bartered with them. After some time an
aged man came on board of us to whom all the others paid honour, so
that we concluded him to be one of their chiefs. We conducted him
to the cabin; he did us reverence by inclining his head down to our
feet; we paid our respects to him in return after our own fashion,
and showed him a cup with fresh water which he showed us by signs
to be obtainable on shore; we then presented him with a knife, a
small looking-glass, and a piece of dungaree. As they were leaving
the cabin one of the natives was caught in the act of stealing the
skipper's pistol and a pair of slippers. We took these articles
from him again without showing the least dissatisfaction. Many of
these people had the lower part of the body painted black down to
the knees, some had a mother-of-pearl shell hanging on the breast.
Towards evening about 20 prows came close to our ships, which all
stationed themselves side by side in regular order. Before coming
alongside they made a good deal of noise, crying out repeatedly
&quot;Woo, woo, woo,&quot; etc., upon which those in our ship sat
down. The said prows then came alongside, bringing a present from
the king, consisting of a fine large hog, a number of coconuts, and
some yams; the bearer of these presents being the same person who
brought us the small white flag and the cloth of bark. We presented
them in return with a common dish such as we use at meals, and a
piece of copper-wire; we also bartered a few coconuts, baccovos,
yams and a hog, etc., against nails and beads; about nightfall they
all left our ship except one who remained to sleep on board of the
Heemskerk.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>Early in the morning again a number of boats came alongside with
coconuts, yams, baccovos, bananas, hogs and fowls, all of which we
bartered with them; to wit, a young hog against a small fathom of
dungaree, a fowl against a nail or a string of beads; coconuts,
yams, bananas, etc., against old nails. Several women, both young
and old, also came on board of us, the oldest of them having the
little finger of both hands cut off, but not so the young women;
what this meant we could not ascertain. About 8 o'clock the old man
of the day before again came on board, bringing us 2 hogs in return
for which we presented him with a silver-mounted knife and 8 or 9
nails. We conducted him below and went all over the ship with him,
and caused one of our great guns to be fired, at which they were
greatly frightened and ran away in amazement, but when they saw
that no one was the worse for it they were soon set at ease again.
We presented this old man with a piece of figured satin, a hat and
a shirt, which we put on him. About noon 32 small and one large
ditto, furnished with sails, and like those delineated in Jacob la
Maire's journal No. came alongside. From these prows 18 strong men
and a few females stepped on board of our ship, bringing with them
as a present a few bark-mats and fruits such as coconuts, yams and
other roots which we had no knowledge of. We presented the leader
of these persons with a shirt, a pair of drawers, a small
looking-glass and a few beads; we put the shirt and the drawers on
him, in which he thought himself very gallantly attired. Among
these 18 persons there was a bony, corpulent man with a St. Thomas
arm, and a woman who had a small natural beard growing about the
mouth. We made the second mate of the Zeehaan come on board of us
with his trumpet, and one of her sailors with a violin, and from
time to time had them blow and play tunes together with our own
trumpeter and one of our sailors who could play the German flute,
at which music they were greatly astonished. Meanwhile we had a
number of water-casks lowered into our boat and the Zeehaan's
cock-boat that our men might together with these people go and see
whether there was any fresh water to be obtained here, as had been
determined in our resolution; we placed a first mate in command of
each of the boats while our skipper Ide Tjercxz and Supercargo
Gilsemans accompanied them in our pinnace, into which we also put
the old man and the leader of the natives who had last come on
board, these two undertaking to show the watering-place to our men.
We also put a number of musketeers into our pinnace, for though
these natives seem to be good-natured enough it is impossible to
know what they hide in their hearts, for which reason we armed our
people to be prepared for all accidents. When our boats had rowed a
considerable distance along the north-east side of this land they
were finally conducted to three small wells, from which water had
to be dipped up by means of a coconut-shell. This water was quite
unfit to be drunk, of a dirty greenish colour, and there was so
little of it that it would have been of little use even if it had
been good to drink. The people who had pointed out these wells to
our men now led them inland to a kind of pleasance and to an
elegant baleye or raised and roofed platform, where our men were
invited to sit down on handsome mats; but the natives brought them
nothing but two coconut-shells filled with water, one for their
chieftain and the other for our skipper. Towards the evening our
men returned on board with a live hog and reported that there was
no chance of getting water there. In the course of this day we
obtained by barter upwards of 40 hogs, giving in exchange for each
of them a double middle-sized nail and half a fathom of old canvas;
and besides about 70 fowls, for each of which we gave a double
middle-sized nail, etc., and a quantity of yams, coconuts and other
fruit in exchange for beads. In the evening one of the chiefs had a
roasted pig, some yams and other roots brought on board of us. The
natives here have no knowledge of tobacco or of smoking of any
kind; their women have the body covered from the waist to the knees
with mats made of the leaves of trees, the rest of the body being
naked; they wear their hair shorter than the men; the beards of the
latter are as a rule the length of three or four finger's breadths,
the hair on the upper lip being cut pretty short so that their
mustachios are no longer than about two straw's breadths. We saw no
arms worn by these people so that it was all peace and amity here.
The current is not strong here, the flood runs south-west and the
ebb north-east, which in our estimation makes it high-water with a
south-westerly moon; the rise and fall of the tide is about 7 or 8
feet.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>In the morning we went to the shore with Skipper Gerrit Jansz
and our two boats together with the pinnace for the purpose of
digging wells to obtain fresh water; when coming ashore we
forthwith went to the wells and made signs to the chief that the
wells would have to be made larger, upon which he directly ordered
his men to do this work for us. He then went with us to the baleye
or platform, and caused a mat to be spread on which we seated
ourselves. When we were seated he had refreshments brought in, such
as fresh milk and cream, fresh fish and various kinds of fruit, of
which there is great abundance here, and in every way showed us
respect and friendship. They then asked us where we had come from
and where were going, upon which we told them that we had been at
sea for a hundred days and upwards, at which they were greatly
astonished; we also told them that we had come there in search of
fresh water, hogs, fowls, etc., to which they answered that they
had plenty of them, as many as we wished.</p>

<p>We then got 8 casks filled with water, and they presented us
with four live hogs and a number of fowls, coconuts, bananas, etc.
In return we offered them one fathom of linen, 6 nails and six
strings of beads, for which they cordially thanked us. We then went
up to the white flag with the three chiefs, signifying to them that
we wished to leave the said flag near the platform in sign of peace
and amity, at which they expressed great satisfaction and put the
flag on their heads one after the other, thereby giving to
understand that they desired nothing but our friendship. They next
fastened the flag to the baleye as a sign that they had made a
covenant with us. As the bottom here is steep and abruptly falling
off our anchor lost its hold by the trade-wind in the afternoon, so
that we drifted out to sea without our being able to prevent it; we
did our best to haul our anchor on the bow but, as we had but few
men on board, we could not secure it before midnight. In the course
of this day we still got by barter a number of pigs and fowls, so
that in all we have got for the two ships a hundred head of hogs,
150 fowls and a reasonable quantity of coconuts, yams and other
fruit; we were compelled to stay on board the Zeehaan for the night
since we could not get on board our own ship.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>In the morning the Heemskerk had drifted fully 4 miles to
leeward of this island; the flute Zeehaan having weighed anchor, we
got near each other again on the forenoon so that we could get on
board our own ship. We then ordered the steersmen of the Zeehaan to
come on board of us, also whereupon we convened the council and
submitted to the consideration of all persons assembled the points
following: seeing that we have been forced to leave this island by
an accident and against our will, seeing that there is small chance
for us to come near it again except with great loss of time, seeing
that there is hardly any water worth mentioning to be obtained
there, whether it would not be best and most advisable to proceed
on our voyage in accordance with the proceeding resolution, and in
case we should meet with other islands to touch at the same, all
which was approved by the council as may be seen from the
resolution under this day's date. At the place where we had been at
anchor there were two islets, high but small, about 1 or 1 1/2
miles in circumference, bearing from us north by west at 7 or 8
miles distance. We now set our course north-eastward with a steady,
south-easterly trade-wind. At noon we had the two islets aforesaid
due east of us at 4 miles distance. These islets we estimated to
lie in 20 degrees 50 minutes South Latitude, Longitude 206 degrees
46 minutes. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon, east-north-east of us
at four or five miles distance, we again saw a low-lying island of
pretty large extent. We steered straight for it. Shortly afterwards
we saw east of us 3 small islets, likewise in the south-east 2
small islets, all of them low-lying; the farthest were at about 3
or 4 miles distance south-east of us. We now set our course due
east-north-east, towards the largest of them, and anchored in 12
fathom, shelly bottom, at a swivel-gunshot distance from shore on
the west side of the island; about an hour before sunset we had at
the western extremity a large high island north-west by north of us
at about 8 or 9 miles distance; and close to this, but more to
eastward and north-west of us, still another island, round and a
good deal higher still than the previous one, in height and size
resembling Cracatouw in Zunda straits, at the same distance from
us; furthermore from the north to the north-east by north we saw 7
more small islets at about 3 or 4 miles distance from us. All these
islands are surrounded by a steep, abruptly descending ground so
that it is impossible to approach them sounding; on which account
one has to anchor by sight, close inshore; almost all of them are
surrounded by coral reefs. Variation 7 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>Early in the morning several prows came alongside with coconuts,
yams, bananas, etc., to be bartered against nails of which their
very desirous. There seemed to be few people living in the said
island; some who seemed to be the most notable of them came on
board of us and were by us presented with small pieces of linen,
knives, small looking-glasses, etc. We then gave them to understand
by signs that we were in want of fresh water, upon which they
signified to us that this was to be obtained on shore in great
plenty. We therefore resolved to send ashore the pilot-major
Francoys Jacobsz and Skipper Gerrit Jansz with our pinnace together
with the two boats, taking with them one of these natives to point
out the watering-place to them. We handed into the pinnace a knife,
a small looking-glass and a little flag in token of peace, and
signified to them that we did not want to have their water without
reward or payment. About two hours before sunset our pinnace
returned with the Skipper and the pilot-major who reported that, on
landing, they had seen from 60 to 70 persons seated on the beach,
who, as they thought, formed the entire male population of the
island; they had no arms but seemed to be a kind and peaceable sort
of people; our men also saw many women and children; they conducted
our men into the interior by a good path. These people proved to be
exceedingly thievish for they stole whatever they could lay hands
on, men and women alike. Our men followed them about 2/3 of a mile
into the interior, where they came to a fresh inland piece of
water, fully 1/4 mile in circumference, and no less than 1 1/2 or 2
fathom above the level of the sea, but they did not know it was so
near the shore; as they were going along the said piece of water
they found it to be at the northern side of the island, at about a
musket-shot distance from the sea, where there was a good sandy bay
for landing with the boats, the water being conveniently smooth for
embarking the casks; out at sea before the said sandy bay there was
a coral reef on which the surf broke with great violence; and since
the said coral reef has an opening on the west side it will be
possible for our boats at low water to row along the shore and
inside the coral reef into the smooth water. But in order to get to
the sandy beach the water must first have risen about&nbsp; 1/2 or
2 feet higher. This bay was on the north side of the islet and, as
our ships were lying on the north-west side, they had to row
upwards of a mile along the shore. They were very glad to have
found this fresh water. About three hours after sunset our two
boats came alongside with filled water-casks, having been prevented
from coming earlier by the falling of the water, which here rises
and falls about 8 feet. In this fresh water aforesaid they had seen
numbers of wild ducks swimming, which were not all shy or afraid of
men. These natives brought on board several coconuts and gourds
full of water; also some fruit and hogs, but not many; they had
prows with sails, as well as smaller ones; their dress, appearance
and manners are like those of the inhabitants of the other island,
except that as a rule the men have shorter and thinner hair than
the others; the women are, comparatively speaking, just as strong
and able-bodied as the men. This island is in Latitude 20 degrees
15 minutes, average Longitude 206 degrees 19 minutes; we gave to it
the name of Rotterdam, seeing that here we got our casks filled
with water. Variation 6 degrees 20 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 26th.</p>

<p>This day we fetched for each of the ships two more boatloads of
water, each consisting of 10 or 11 casks, both great and small; we
also bartered still a good many coconuts, bananas and other fruit
against beads and old nails.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>We still kept taking in water and bartering refreshments; before
sunset we had again got on board two boatloads of water for each
ship.</p>

<p>Item the 28th.</p>

<p>In the morning at early dawn myself with Skipper Gerrit Jansz
again went to the watering-place with our two boats and the
pinnace. Our main purpose was to shoot wild ducks but we could not
get any. As we were engaged in putting off from shore with the
loaded boats one of the natives approached with the intention of
secretly carrying off a long pike, which he had actually snatched
from the boat and hid under water; but one of our men saw him, upon
which the thief, becoming aware of this, ran into the wood with the
pike as quickly as his legs would carry him. The other natives
seeing this ran after him with great speed, beckoning to our men to
remain where they were because they were going to bring him back.
They really did so, so that we had the pike returned to us. The
natives here are excessively licentious, wanton and thievishly
inclined, so that a man had need of Argus' hundred eyes to look
about him. In the evening before sunset we again had got on board
two boat-loads of water for each of the ships, so that up to now we
already have 26 hogsheads quite filled, only about 10 hogsheads and
casks being still empty; we also obtained by barter a considerable
quantity of coconuts, bananas, baccovos and other fruit, so that at
these islands we were well provided with refreshments and fresh
water for which God be thanked.</p>

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>We again sent ashore the pilot-major with our boats together
with the pinnace to fetch water, but in the afternoon the wind
began to blow so stiffly from the north that the men in the
Zeehaan's boat had to let 5 casks of water run out at the bung-hole
while rowing, and to throw the casks overboard; afterwards they had
to let go 4 more casks, so that they got on board without any fresh
water; our own boat managed to come alongside with 7 full casks,
and to bring the empty casks with her, but they had had plenty of
trouble in doing so.</p>

<p>Item the 30th.</p>

<p>We summoned our friends of the Zeehaan on board of us and,
having convened the council, we read out to them our instructions,
after which we requested every member of the council, if he should
know of anything to the advantage and profit of the Honourable
Company that might be unknown to ourselves, to inform us of the
same and to assist us with all needful zeal and diligence. We
likewise earnestly and kindly entreated each of the members
assembled to act in every respect in such fashion as he intends to
answer for on his return to Batavia before the Honourable
Governor-General and Councillors of India. We likewise resolved if
this wind should continue to set sail from here with our ships
tomorrow; but if it should go round to eastward we shall directly
make arrangements for getting all our casks filled with water; all
of which may be seen set forth in extenso in this day's resolution,
to which we beg leave to refer.</p>

<p>In this day's meeting of the council we also resolved upon the
articles following, which shall be read to our men and posted up on
the quarter-deck, that every man may comport himself
accordingly:</p>

<p>Seeing that on the 27th instant at night we have found that some
persons, even officers, do not properly stand their ordained
watches, the which in many cases might cause hurt and peril to our
ships and crews, in order to prevent such inconveniences and perils
for the future the plenary council of the ships Heemskerk and
Zeehaan has this day resolved and ordered that whoever shall, after
now, be found sleeping or neglecting to keep a proper lookout,
whether on watch or on the lookout, shall for the first offence be
flogged by the partners of his watch; for the second offence,
besides being flogged, he shall forfeit a month's pay; for the
third offence he shall be deprived of six months' pay, and for the
fourth offence he shall be deprived of his office and forfeit his
pay or, if the offender should be a sailor, be forced to serve
without pay.</p>

<p>According to the same articles all persons on board, none
excepted, are strictly forbidden to use or carry about their
persons any live matches, candles, or other lights of any sort,
unless such matches, candles etc. shall be wanted in the discharge
of office or for the requirements of the ship's service, and be
used with the knowledge of the ship's officers; all this on pain of
being put in irons for eight days in succession, and of forfeiting
a month's pay over and above this.</p>

<p>Likewise after the watches have been set no one shall be
permitted to make any noise whatever, but each person shall keep
watch over such places as have been assigned to his care by the
Commander, the skipper, the steersmen or the quartermasters; all
this on pain of summary punishment.</p>

<p>The men on watch shall, whether by day or by night, not allow
anyone to come on board except with the consent of the commander,
the skipper, or the supercargo, on pain of corporal punishment.</p>

<p>Given on board the Heemskerk, at anchor in Latitude 20 degrees
15 minutes, average Longitude 206 degrees 19 minutes, south of the
line equinoctial. This 30th day of January A.D. 1643.</p>

<p>Item the last.</p>

<p>In the morning we again set out the boats, together with our
pinnace, to fetch water, but as the weather began to darken and to
look variable. We made a signal for them to return, upon which they
came back at once. At noon we, that is to say myself, our skipper,
the pilot-major, the skipper and the supercargo of the Zeehaan and
the secretary, went on shore with the two boats and the pinnace for
the purpose of taking leave of the natives, since it was our
intention to depart from here. As soon as we had landed a great
multitude of people assembled. We asked two persons who seemed most
notable of them after the chief of this district. They conducted us
into the interior by narrow, cramped, dirty and miry paths (it
having rained very hard for one or two days without interruption).
We were first led to the south side of the island where a large
number of coconut-trees stood side by side in regular order. Thence
they went with us to the east side of the island where six large
prows were lying at anchor, each two of them being fastened
together by means of a floor of planks and carrying a mast. Here
were also one or two small houses ornamented a little above the
common, to wit, fenced all round with a bamboo enclosure. After
leaving this place we came to a lake or piece of brackish inland
water, about a mile in circumference. After staying here for some
time we again asked after the Aisy or Latouw (which in their speech
means king or chieftain). They then pointed to the far side of this
water and, as the sun was close to the horizon already, we returned
to our boats along a different path. Both in going and returning we
saw many enclosures or gardens with plots elegantly squared and
planted with all sorts of earth-fruit. In several places we saw
bananas and other fruit-trees, most of them growing so straight
that they were good to look at, on all sides emitting a most
agreeable and gratifying smell and fragrance. From which we
concluded that these people (who had the shape of men but inhuman
manners and customs) were by no means destitute of human
intelligence. About two hours before sunset we returned on board.
These islands are in their average longitude 185 miles more to
eastward than the Salomonis islands and, according to my
estimation, are situated 230 miles east of the easternmost
Salomonis islands. These natives know nothing of religion or the
service of God, nor have they either idols, other relics, or
priests. Still they are very superstitious for I have seen one of
these persons take up a watersnake which came floating by his prow,
lay it upon his head with great reverence, and then put it into the
water again. They will never kill any of the flies which are very
plentiful here and cause trouble enough, however many cover their
bodies. While we were at anchor here our chief mate happened to
kill a fly in the presence of one of the chieftains, who showed
himself greatly incensed at this. The people of this island have no
king or chief and are without any government. Still they have some
knowledge of evil and punish evil-doers, but not through the arm of
justice, all the non-culprits as a rule taking part in the
execution of the punishment. We have seen the proof of this at a
time when we were fetching water, and one of the natives had
carried off one of our pikes, with which he ran off into the wood.
We had seen him do it and signified to the others our anger. They
seeing this, ran after him and, having taken the pike from him
brought it back to us a great distance, and punished the thief or
evil-doer like this: they took an old coconut and battered his back
with it until the nut got cracked; we could not find out if this is
their usual practice or was on this occasion done for our sake
only.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of February.</p>

<p>Seeing that at present we find ourselves provided with plenty of
refreshments and that we have got nearly all our casks filled with
water, for which the Ruler of all things be fervently thanked and
praised, and that for some days past the wind has been continually
blowing from the north, which makes the coast near the
watering-place a lee-shore, so that we are unable to fill our
remaining casks, therefore we have deemed it advisable to continue
our voyage, for which reason early this morning we weighed anchor
and set sail to northward with a favourable breeze from the
east.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>At noon we had the southernmost of the high islands
south-south-east and the northernmost south-east by south of us at
about 6 or 7 miles distance. At noon Latitude observed 19 degrees
20 minutes, Longitude 205 degrees 55 minutes, course held from the
island north-north-west, sailed 15 miles. These high islands are
situated north-north-west slightly more to westward of the island
where we got water at 7 or 8 miles distance. Halfway the afternoon
we saw another island north-east by east of us at about 7 miles
distance, also pretty high; the wind blowing from the east with a
light breeze.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>In the morning we still saw the island which in the previous
evening we had north-east by east of us; we now had it
east-south-east of us at about 8 miles distance. At noon Latitude
observed 18 degrees 18 minutes, Longitude 205 degrees 55 minutes;
course held north, sailed 15 miles; the wind blowing from the
east-south-east and south-east with trade-wind weather, a clear sky
and smooth water.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>Good weather and a clear sky with smooth water; in the morning
we estimated ourselves to have passed the 17th degree, on which
account we turned our course to westward in accordance with the
resolution. At noon Latitude estimated 16 degrees 40 minutes,
Longitude 205 degrees 25 minutes; course kept north by west, sailed
25 miles; the wind being east-south-east and south-east with a
topsail breeze and trade-wind weather; towards the evening we had a
few squalls with thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>We continued to have trade-wind weather with the wind as before,
a topsail and smooth water. At noon Latitude observed 16 degrees 30
minutes, Longitude 203 degrees 12 minutes; course held west, sailed
32 miles; at noon we set our course west by south in order to reach
the 17th degree, and had a good lookout kept so as not to sail past
the Cocos or Verraders islands; during the night when three glasses
of the dog-watch had run out we saw land, upon which we immediately
hauled aboard our larboard tacks and ran southward till seven
glasses in the same watch were out, when we tacked to the north
again.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>In the morning we again saw land, to wit three small islets, on
all sides surrounded by shoals and reefs; we tacked about to the
south and saw a large reef to westward stretching as far as the
south, which we sincerely regretted; this land is fully 8 or 9
miles in length; straight ahead there were also breakers which we
were unable to pass. Seeing that we could clear neither the reef
straight ahead nor another which lay north of us we observed to
leeward a small space about two ship's lengths wide where there
were no breakers; for this we made since there was no other way of
escape; we passed between the rocks in 4 fathom, though not without
great anxiety; all about here there are reefs and 18 or 19 islands,
but the shoals which abound here and are very dangerous render it
impossible for ships to pass between them. These islands are in 17
1/2 degrees or thereabouts for we got no latitude. At noon we
estimated ourselves to be in 17 degrees 9 minutes South Latitude,
Longitude 201 degrees 35 minutes, course held west-south-west,
sailed 25 miles with a steady trade-wind from the east-south-east.
We should have greatly liked to have come to anchor near one of
these islands but could find no roadstead on account of the
numberless shoals and reefs that run out to sea from all these
islands. At noon we turned our course to northward in order if
possible to get clear of all these shoals in the daytime. Towards
the north too we saw numerous shoals everywhere, which it would be
difficult to pass through. At length however we found an opening
and sailed through between the reefs, but to our great regret had
to leave these isles because we found no ground for anchoring. In
the evening we saw three hills which we thought to be islands.
During 5 glasses of the first watch we again made for the land in
order to avoid the shoal ahead of us. The wind was blowing from the
east and we sailed with our mainsail set. When 5 glasses of the
first watch were out we tacked to northward and ran northward till
daybreak, when we saw the island which on the previous evening we
had seen north by west of us.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>We kept sailing to the north close to the wind with our mainsail
set, the wind being north-east with a strong gale and showers of
rain and a high sea running from the north. The Pilot-major thought
that the islands which we had been near to on the 6th instant are
the islands which in the large chart are found south-west of the
Hoornsche islands; for which reason he was of the opinion that we
ought to shape our course to northward close by the wind in order
to keep clear of the coast of New Guinea, since this is a lee-shore
and the season unfavourable so that it might prove impossible to
put off from shore again. In the morning we came close upon an
island, therefore tacked to the south until daybreak when we turned
to the north again, the wind blowing a storm from the north-east;
we therefore tacked to the north-west with small sail. At noon
Latitude estimated 16 degrees, Longitude 200 degrees 48 minutes;
course kept north-west by north, sailed 21 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>The wind kept blowing very strong from the north-east and
north-north-east with a great deal of rain. We still sailed close
to the wind with small sail. Having called the Pilot-major aft we
asked him whether he persisted in his opinion that these were the
islands he had mentioned the day before. He answered in the
affirmative and added that in his opinion we ought to steer
northward directly if the wind should allow of it. Owing to the
rough and stormy weather we could not get our friends of the
Zeehaan on board of us nor even speak them; upon which we convened
the council of the Heemskerk, together with the two second mates,
and submitted to their consideration the opinion given by the
Pilot-major; asking all of them to give us their own opinions in
writing that from these collective advices we might draw up a
resolution which we accordingly did in the afternoon. Wind and
weather as before; at noon we estimated ourselves to be in 15
degrees 29 minutes South Latitude, Longitude 199 degrees 31
minutes; course kept west-north-west, sailed 20 miles, in
accordance with the advices resolved upon this day.</p>

<p>We should have liked to have convened the councils of both
ships, but were prevented from so doing by the turbulence of the
weather with rain and wind; for which reason we summoned the
council of the ship Heemskerk, together with the two second mates,
and represented to them that for many days past we have had such
weather that at times we could hardly see to a distance of two or
three ship's lengths, and that on the 6th instant we had been
entangled between islands and shoals to such a degree that we could
only with difficulty get clear of the same. These islands are 18 or
20 in number so far as we could count them, though it is quite
possible that there are more since, owing to the darkness of the
weather, it was very difficult to count them. These islands are
situated full in the course of Jacob la Maire, but since in this
latitude he ran on for 430 miles due west and did not find any such
islands there we might conclude that these islands do not lie in
the line of the said course. But in the great chart of the South
Sea certain islands are marked which agree with these as regards
their latitude; but this would make a difference with our reckoning
of more than 200 miles, the said islands being marked in the chart
so many miles more to westward. Now during this long voyage we have
almost continually been sailing eastward and westward, often with
storms and tempests, for which reason the proverb which says that
guesswork often shoots wide of the mark may well be applicable to
us, and we be so far out in our reckoning.</p>

<p>For all these reasons it is our opinion that, wind and weather
permitting, we should from here run due north as far as the 4th
degree of Southern Latitude and then due west as far as the coast
of New Guinea, seeing that the weather we now have is such that one
might easily miss a known coast, let alone an unknown one; that
there is no good anchorage there, and a lee-shore besides, so that
we should run great risk of losing our ships and men alike, and
that we are in the bad season here, when the south-east trade-wind
and the northern monsoon meet each other, which cannot fail to
cause much rain and rough weather.</p>

<p>Given on board the ship Heemskerk this day the 8th of February,
A.D. 1643 in 15 degrees 29 minutes Southern Latitude and 199
degrees 31 minutes Longitude.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>ABEL JANSZ TASMAN.</p>

<p>This day the 8th of February A.D. 1643, our ships being in the
estimated latitude of 15 degrees 23 minutes, Longitude 198 degrees
4 minutes, the Honourable Commander Abel Jansz Tasman has enjoined
the council of the ship Heemskerk, each member to give his opinion
in writing respecting the course to be held from here, whether to
the west-north-west or more northerly, in order in the most
convenient way to make the coast of New Guinea or the islands
situated at the north-east point.</p>

<p>Therefore we, so far as regards ourselves, will give our opinion
as follows: in the first place it is now the bad season and the
period of rain in the Moluccas, and here we have every day rain and
strong north-east winds which cause the east side of New Guinea to
be a lee shore; also it is a rule all over the East Indies the
nearer a lee shore the worse weather. If one wants to make the
coast of New Guinea in the latitude of the Salomonis islands,
partly in accordance with the directions and instructions given,
though not constituting a positive command, this could not be done
without incurring the risk of being cast into a bay from which it
might be difficult or impossible to beat out again; and since the
east side of New Guinea is still unknown it is quite possible that
there may be plenty of small islands and shoals to eastward of the
said Land of New Guinea, such as we have already met with before
and, having no secure anchorage in such rough weather, in which it
is impossible to keep a proper lookout, we might happen to be cast
on the shore before we had become aware of the same.</p>

<p>For which reason we think that from here we should sail
northward as close to the wind as shall be found practicable as far
as 4 or 5 degrees South Latitude; the object of our advice being to
avoid all risks and prevent our being thrown on a lee-shore, seeing
that the coast falls away there, whence we could run to the west in
the first instance and next regulate ourselves by wind and
weather.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>FRANCOYS JACOBSZ.</p>

<p>Whereas on the 8th instant we are now having a good deal of
rough weather, both with rain and strong north winds, so that we
can hardly carry mainsails and cannot see to a quarter of a mile
distance, the Commander had convened the council of the Heemskerk,
together with the second mates, and desired each of them to give in
his opinion in writing; I therefore state as my opinion that we
ought to direct our course as far to northward as wind and weather
shall permit, nay even due north or north by east, as far as 2 or 3
degrees South Latitude, to avoid being cast on the lee-shore of New
Guinea; seeing that we are in the bad season here and it is quite
possible that we may have got farther to westward than our account
makes it, since on the 6th instant we came across 20 or 21 islands
lying in 17 degrees 10 minutes South Latitude, which were not seen
by Jacob la Maire.</p>

<p>This day the 8th of February 1643 on board the Yacht Heemskerk,
Latitude estimated 15 degrees 43 minutes, Longitude 199 degrees 7
minutes.</p>

<p>IDE TJERRXZ HOLMAN.</p>

<p>This day the 8th of February A.D. 1643. Whereas in my estimation
we are now in Latitude 15 degrees 47 minutes, Longitude 198 degrees
10 minutes, the weather having been stormy for several days past
and the Honourable Commander having desired each of us to give his
advice in writing regarding the course to be held and up to what
latitude; it would be my advice that we ought to steer on a
north-west course as far as 3 degrees of Latitude south of the
Equator and afterwards to westward.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>CARSTEN JURRIAENSZ.</p>

<p>To the Honourable Mr. Abel Jansz. Tasman.</p>

<p>It is my advice that from here, being the estimated southern
latitude of 15 degrees 44 minutes, and the longitude of 198 degrees
19 minutes, we should steer our course as far to northward as shall
be found practicable so as to avoid being cast on the land of New
Guinea, as far as the southern latitude of 6 or 7 degrees, since we
are now getting on for the bad season here when the winds are
blowing from the north-east and north-north-east, and there is much
rain and a difficult lookout to be expected and, if we should
happen to be thrown on a lee-shore with our ships, there would be
small chance of getting them off again, owing to want of sailing
wind, and we might easily fall into peril with our ships and
cargoes; therefore in my opinion it is better to stick to the
course aforesaid and, when we have got so far with the aid of God,
to direct our course to westward and try to make the land of New
Guinea, and afterwards to steer our course for the land of Gilolo.
Given thus on board the Yacht Heemskerk, A.D. 1643, the 8th of
February.</p>

<p>CHRYN HENDRECXZ DE RATTE.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>The wind blowing from the north with rain and a strong gale. We
kept sailing with our mainsail set, the sea being very rough and
running very high from the north and north-west. At noon Latitude
estimated 15 degrees 29 minutes, Longitude 198 degrees 8 minutes;
course held west, sailed 20 miles. In the evening we tacked about
to the east, hauled up our foresail, and in this way ran on close
to the wind with our mainsail and mizzen-sail set until the end of
the first watch; we then loosened our foresail again and tacked
about to westward. In the day-watch we set our great topsail but
before long had to take it in again.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>We still had variable weather with rain and wind, the sea
running from all directions, so that the water is very rough and we
are experiencing very unfavourable weather for discovering
anything, which is now quite impossible to all this dark, hazy,
drizzling weather. At noon Latitude estimated 15 degrees 19 minutes
South, Longitude 197 degrees 20 minutes; course held north-west by
north, sailed 12 miles. For the last five days past we have been
without seeing either sun, moon or stars. In the evening we lowered
the foresail down to the stem and lay to with mainsail and
mizzen-sail.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>The storm still raging from the north, and the sea still running
very high from all sides, with dark, foggy, drizzling, rainy
weather and a good deal of lightning. At noon Latitude estimated 15
degrees 5 minutes South Latitude, Longitude 196 degrees 6 minutes;
course held west by north, sailed and drifted 18 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>After breakfast it began to clear up to some extent, so that we
set our great topsail; the sun broke through the clouds, and it
seemed as if the weather was going to change; the sea is however
still running very high, mainly from the west-south-west. At noon
Latitude observed 15 degrees 3 minutes, Longitude 195 degrees 50
minutes; course held west, sailed 18 miles; halfway the afternoon
we again got the same rainy and stormy weather we had had before,
so that we had to take in our great topsail and to sail with two
mainsails without bonnets; the wind is mainly blowing from the
north and north-north-west and is exceedingly variable. In the
evening we steered to the east until midnight then tacked about to
the west; during the night we had a pouring rain, so that the water
seemed to come down in torrents, accompanied by thunder and
lightning.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>In the morning, the weather being somewhat better and the sea
having calmed down to some extent, we set our topsails but without
sliding out the bonnets. We continued to have occasional showers
and the wind still blew from the north; during the last twenty-four
hours we sailed and drifted 12 miles to west-south-west. At noon
Latitude estimated 15 degrees 21 minutes south, the Latitude
observed being 15 degrees 38 minutes, Longitude 194 degrees 4
minutes; the sea is becoming a good deal smoother; during the night
we lay to with small sail.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>The wind north-west and north-north-west with good weather,
though it was still thick, hazy and dark, so that it was difficult
to keep a lookout. We sent the pilot-major with the secretary to
the Zeehaan to require the opinions in writing of her officers. At
noon Latitude observed 16 degrees 20 minutes, Longitude 193 degrees
35 minutes; course held south-west, sailed 10 miles.</p>

<p>The following are the advices of our friends on board the
Zeehaan:</p>

<p>This day the 14th of February of the year 1643. Whereas the
Commander had this day sent the pilot-major and his secretary on
board of us to hear our advices as regards the shaping of our
courses, and secondly in what latitude it would be best to touch at
the land of New Guinea; my advice touching the point referred to is
that we had best touch at the land aforesaid in 4 or 5 degrees
South Latitude. The reason why I would advise to touch at this land
so far to northward is as follows: we have had very rough weather
for 6 or 7 days past and been in fear of getting into a bay or
being cast on a lee-shore; in the latitude aforesaid we should come
upon the land in a known latitude; and if we have touched at the
land in the said latitude it is likely we shall be able to get to
the south if the time at our disposal shall permit us to do so. It
is consequently my opinion that we should shape our course as far
to northward as possible until we got to the latitude aforesaid and
then steer due west until in the latitude aforesaid we come in
sight of New Guinea. At this time of writing we were by account in
Latitude 15 degrees 49 minutes south, Longitude 194 degrees 37
minutes.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>GERRIT JANSZ.</p>

<p>Advice or reasons why and for what cause we hold it most
expedient to navigate to the north.</p>

<p>Whereas Your Worship has been pleased to ask us to give in our
opinion or advice touching the question submitted to us in writing
yesterday, my judgment in this matter is as follows: since we are
at present in Latitude 15 degrees 55 minutes south, Longitude 194
degrees 24 minutes, and the weather here about this time of the
year would seem to be very variable, while in this region of the
world we are as it were at the mercy of winds blowing from all the
four quarters, and we do not know how near we have sailed to the
land of New Guinea, except what in this respect we can gather from
the terrestrial globe and the great chart of the South Sea, we
trust that the islands made by the Honourable Commander are the
Salomonis islands, seeing that in longitude and latitude we have
found them to agree with the indications in the chart of the
Portuguese; the said islands cannot have been seen by Schoutens and
therefore they may be the land of New Guinea which, according to
the Portuguese chart, we might also happen to fall in with.</p>

<p>For the reason above given it is therefore my opinion, regard
being had to the roughness of the weather and to the possibility
that we may be nearer to the said land than we suspect, to the fact
that we do not know its trend in this latitude and what bays,
inlets, bights, shoals and the like there may be in and about it,
to the risk that with these northerly winds we may by storm or
rough weather be cast and driven on a lee-shore, which would
grievously endanger both ship and cargo; it is therefore, I repeat,
my opinion that we ought to steer our course north-north-west to
the known part of New Guinea about as far as 4 or 5 degrees
Southern Latitude, and by so doing avoid all perils as much as
possible. Given on board the flute-ship the Zeehaan this 15th of
February, 1643.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>Your devoted servant,</p>

<p>J. GILSEMANS.</p>

<p>My advice is that we ought to make the land of New Guinea in 5
or 6 degrees South Latitude, seeing that for six days past we have
had exceedingly rough weather; that if we should be driven into a
bay we might get such weather that it would prove impossible for us
to beat out of it; I think that we ought to shape our course as far
to northward as the wind will allow us till we got to the latitude
aforesaid, and then steer westward in order to make the land of New
Guinea. We are at present in Latitude 16 degrees 3 minutes, and
Longitude 195 degrees 27 minutes on the 14th of February 1643.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>HENDRICK PIETERSZ.</p>

<p>This day the 14th of February, 1643. Whereas for 6 or 7 days
past we have now had north wind with dark, rough and dirty weather,
so that we may very well be nearer land than we suspect, and run
the risk of being driven into a bay from which with a northerly
wind and this unsettled weather it would be very difficult for us
to get out again, therefore my advice is that we should run on as
far as 5 or 6 degrees South Latitude, so as to make the coast of
New Guinea on the north side; and I further think that we should
shape our course as far northward as the wind will allow us until
we arrive at the said latitude, and then steer to westward in order
to touch at New Guinea. This day at noon we are in Latitude 15
degrees 57 minutes South, and Longitude 195 degrees 49 minutes.</p>

<p>Signed by me,</p>

<p>PIETER NANNINGHZ. DUYTS.</p>

<p>This day the 14th of the month of February, our ship being in 15
degrees 57 minutes South Latitude, and the middle longitude of 195
degrees 10 minutes, and the Honourable Commander desiring to be
informed of the reasons why we should set our course so far to
northward as we had fixed upon, I give it as my opinion that, since
we have now had a violent storm with rain and dark weather these 6
or 7 days past, and do not know whether we are still far from shore
or near it, and whether we may not again be driven into some bay or
be cast on shoals or reefs, as happened to us on the 6th instant,
we ought to attempt to make New Guinea in 5 or 6 degrees southern
latitude to the end that we may be able to get off shore on a
northerly course; it being further my advice that we should set our
course as high to northward as shall be found possible, in order to
reach that latitude aforesaid and then steer to westward until we
get to the land of New Guinea.</p>

<p>Signed by me,</p>

<p>CORNELIS YSBRANTSZ ROOLOL.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>Still dark, foggy weather with rain and the wind from the
north-west and west-north-west with a light breeze; we tacked this
way and that so that we made no progress, having the wind almost
flat against us. At noon Latitude estimated 16 degrees 30 minutes
South, Longitude 193 degrees 35 minutes; course held south, drifted
2 miles. Towards the evening we got a violent squall of rain from
south-west and set our course to northward. In the first watch it
fell a calm so that we drifted in a calm the whole of the
night.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>In the morning we kept drifting in a calm. During the last 24
hours we made no progress owing to the dead calm.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>We had a variable breeze alternating with dead calm so that
again we failed to make any progress. Towards the evening the wind
became south-west with rain, upon which we shaped our course to the
north; after a short time however it fell a calm again so that we
did not sail more than two miles to northward. Latitude estimated
16 degrees 22 minutes, Longitude 193 degrees 35 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>It continued calm until noon; we remained in the same latitude
and longitude as before; at noon we got a light breeze from the
south-east with occasional showers.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>The wind still south-east with rain. At noon Latitude observed
15 degrees 12 minutes, longitude 193 degrees 35 minutes; course
kept north, sailed 18 miles. We still had dark, rainy weather every
day, very unhealthy, and no chance of a lookout to discover
land.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>Still thick, dark, foggy, rainy weather with the sea running
from all directions, and variable winds, now a calm, now a breeze.
At noon Latitude observed 13 degrees 45 minutes, Longitude 193
degrees 35 minutes; course held north, sailed 21 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>The wind still variable from the west and north-west going up to
north; we set our course close by the wind to northward; the sea is
still very rough with copious rains. At noon Latitude estimated 13
degrees 21 minutes, Longitude 193 degrees 35 minutes; course held
north, sailed 6 miles; in the afternoon we ran to northward. During
the night we drifted in a calm for the space of 12 glasses, after
which we got a breeze from the north, when we tacked to
westward.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind was still northerly with a good deal of
rain, we still held our course to westward close by the wind, and
had very heavy swells from the north-west. The weather was dark,
drizzly, and foggy; now strong gales, now a sudden calm. At noon we
made out by account to be in Latitude 13 degrees 5 minutes South,
Longitude 192 degrees 57 minutes; course held west-north-west,
sailed 10 miles. In the afternoon the wind went round to the
north-east and east. Towards the evening the wind became
south-east, and then south, with much rain and a strong gale.
During the night we lay to with small sail; we also saw a number of
logs floating about.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>A westerly wind with a storm, thick, dark weather and much rain;
at times we could hardly see to a distance of two ship's lengths;
the sea was very rough, running from all sides. At noon Latitude
estimated 12 degrees 10 minutes, Longitude 192 degrees 57 minutes;
course held north, sailed 14 miles; during the night we sailed
northward close to the wind.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>In the morning we set our topsails. We had the wind from the
west-north-west and north-west with a stiff gale and frequent
showers, the sea being still very rough. At noon Latitude estimated
11 degrees 2 minutes, Longitude 192 degrees 28 minutes; course held
north-north-east, sailed 18 miles. In the afternoon we had to take
in our topsails and ran over to northward close to the wind; during
the night we lay to with one sail since we dared not sail on, there
being no lookout, from fear we might come upon land or shoals.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>In the morning we made sail again; when day broke we saw that
the Zeehaan had her mizzen-mast broken; we then hoisted our
foresail, hailed the Zeehaan, and asked her how she was getting on;
they replied that they could help themselves until the weather
should improve; her mizzen-mast is broken in such a way that she
can still carry a small mizzen-sail. The wind was still blowing
from the north-west and north-west by west with a storm, much rain,
and dark weather; we went over to northward close to the wind; at
noon Latitude estimated 10 degrees 31 minutes south, Longitude 193
degrees; course held north-east, sailed 11 miles; during the night
we again lay to with small sail.</p>

<p>Item the 26th.</p>

<p>The wind blowing pretty stiffly from the north-west, still with
a good deal of rain and dark weather. I cannot understand how it is
that such a steady westerly wind is blowing here so far into the
South Sea unless it should be that the western monsoon is
continually blowing over New Guinea and coming on stiffly, pressed
on a good way into the South Sea with the trade-wind blowing
lightly. For 21 days past now we have not had a single dry day. At
noon Latitude estimated 9 degrees 48 minutes south, Longitude 193
degrees 43 minutes; course held north-east, sailed 15 miles; during
the night we lay to with small sail.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>In the morning we made sail again, set our course over to
northward close to the wind with the wind blowing from the
north-west and north-north-west, and thick, dark, drizzly, rainy
weather, but the sea beginning to become smoother; at noon Latitude
estimated 9 degrees south, Longitude 194 degrees 32 minutes; course
held north-east, sailed 17 miles; at night when 6 glasses in the
first watch were out the wind went round to the north and we turned
our course to westward.</p>

<p>Item the last.</p>

<p>The wind still blowing from the north and north-north-west with
thick, foggy, drizzly, rainy weather, our course held westerly
still. At noon Latitude estimated 8 degrees 48 minutes south,
Longitude 194 degrees 2 minutes; course kept west-north-west,
sailed 8 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of March.</p>

<p>Good weather with smooth water and a northerly but variable
wind; we turned our course to westward. At noon Latitude observed 9
degrees 5 minutes, Longitude 193 degrees 21 minutes; course held
west-south-west, sailed 11 miles. In the evening we got a squall of
rain from the west and for the rest of the night drifted in a
calm.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>Towards daybreak we got a light breeze from the north and set
our course to westward. At noon Latitude observed 9 degrees 11
minutes, Longitude 192 degrees 46 minutes; held our course west
slightly southerly, east, west and west by south betweenwhiles,
sailed 12 miles, with variable winds and weather. Variation of the
compass 10 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>Wind and weather very unsettled, with much rain and very
variable winds, alternating between a dead calm and gales so strong
that we could hardly carry sail; we estimated that in the last 24
hours we had sailed 8 miles; course held west, Latitude estimated 9
degrees 11 minutes south, Longitude 192 degrees 14 minutes; in the
evening we had very much rain again and drifted in a calm.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>Wind and weather continued variable with much rain, the wind
keeping however between the south-west and north. We are in hopes
however that the weather will soon get better. At noon Latitude
estimated 8 degrees 55 minutes, Longitude 191 degrees 57 minutes;
course held north-north-west, sailed 5 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>Wind and weather still variable with heavy rains. This variable
weather has now lasted for a month past during which we have made
little progress and have continually been holding our courses
between the south-west and north but we hope things will soon mend.
At noon Latitude estimated 8 degrees 32 minutes south, Longitude
191 degrees 42 minutes; course held north-north-west, sailed 8
miles. Variation 10 degrees 30 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>Still variable winds with a good deal of rain, violent squalls
alternating with sudden calms; a man who should wish to describe
all these chops and changes of wind and weather might be kept doing
nothing else but write. At noon Latitude estimated 8 degrees 8
minutes south, Longitude 191 degrees 42 minutes; course held north,
sailed 6 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>Still thick, dark, drizzly, rainy weather with variable wind and
weather and a very rough sea; the wind continues keeping between
the west-south-west and north-west; we have the wind straight
ahead. At noon Latitude estimated 8 degrees 17 minutes south,
Longitude 191 degrees 1 minute; course kept west by south, sailed
12 miles. This day we saw a great many birds.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>Still thick, dark, drizzly, rainy weather with the wind as
before; we therefore kept tacking about with the starboard forward
in order to get as far to westward as possible; but we fear we
shall get no good wind before the close of the western monsoon; we
have heavy rains every day. At noon Latitude estimated 7 degrees 46
minutes south, Longitude 190 degrees 47 minutes; course held
north-north-west and west, sailed 9 miles. Towards the evening the
wind began to stiffen so that we had to take in our topsails and to
sail with mainsails.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>We kept sailing with our mainsails set with a storm from the
north-west and north-north-west and in thick, dark, foggy,
drizzling weather; we had a great deal of rain which is doing us a
great deal of harm bodily, and the sea is very rough. At noon
Latitude estimated 8 degrees 33 minutes south, Longitude 190
degrees 1 minute; course held south-west, sailed 16 miles; during
the night we lay to with small sail for the space of 16 glasses
because we dared not sail full speed.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>In the morning we again set our foresail and went over to
westward; we had the wind from the north-north-west with very
unsettled weather and heavy rains; we set our large topsail but had
to take it in again directly on account of bad weather. At noon
Latitude estimated 9 degrees south, Longitude 189 degrees 33
minutes; course held south-west, sailed and drifted 10 miles;
during the night we set our course to westward with small sail.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>Still dark, foggy, drizzly, rainy weather, with a northerly wind
but very unsteady; in the morning we had a north-north-east wind
and set our course close to the wind. At noon Latitude estimated 9
degrees 12 minutes south, Longitude 188 degrees 29 minutes; course
held west by south, sailed 17 miles. In the afternoon we saw that
those on board the Zeehaan brailed up their mainsail and took in
their foretopsail, upon which we forthwith let fall our foresail to
stay for her and inquire whether she had broken anything. When she
came near us we understood that her mainsail was torn to pieces and
that they were engaged in repairing it.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>Still unsettled weather; we had variable winds from the northern
quarter. At noon Latitude estimated 8 degrees 48 minutes south,
Longitude 187 degrees 29 minutes; course held west-north-west,
sailed 16 miles; after midnight we drifted in a calm.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>Still dark, thick weather; in the afternoon we drifted in a
calm, the sea still running very high from the north-west; at noon
Latitude estimated 8 degrees 48 minutes south, Longitude 186
degrees 48 minutes; course held west, sailed 10 miles. During the
night we got a light breeze from the south and turned our course to
the north-west.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>The wind from the south but almost a calm; good dry weather and
the sea still running from the north-west. We saw some boughs of
trees floating but did not sight any land. During the night the
wind went round to the south-east with a light breeze. At noon
Latitude observed 10 degrees 12 minutes, our estimation being 1 2/3
degree to northward than the latitude now got by observation. We
had not been able to observe the latitude for 12 days past owing to
the thick, dark, drizzly weather we had every day with heavy rains.
According to our estimation our longitude was 186 degrees 14
minutes; course held north-west, sailed 13 miles. Variation 8
degrees 45 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>Good weather, the sea beginning to go down but the surges are
still running against each other. The wind blew from the south-east
with the weather improving; course held north-west, sailed 12
miles. At noon Latitude observed 9 degrees 33 minutes, Longitude
185 degrees 40 minutes. Variation 8 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>Good, quiet weather with a bright sun which we have not had for
6 weeks past. At noon Latitude observed 8 degrees 46 minutes,
Longitude 184 degrees 51 minutes; course held north-west, sailed 17
miles. Variation 9 degrees.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>Good weather and smooth water, the wind easterly with a light
breeze. At noon Latitude observed 8 degrees 7 minutes, Longitude
184 degrees 11 minutes; course held north-west, sailed 14
miles.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>Good weather with an easterly wind and a light breeze with
smooth water; at noon Latitude observed 7 degrees 40 minutes,
Longitude 183 degrees 33 minutes; course held north-west, sailed 12
miles. Variation 9 degrees; in the afternoon the breeze began
somewhat to stiffen.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>Still good weather with a clear sky and a topsail breeze with
the wind from the east. The sea begins to run from the east and
north-east. At noon Latitude observed 6 degrees 25 minutes,
Longitude 182 degrees 27 minutes; course held north-west, sailed 23
miles.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>Good weather and smooth water with occasional squalls of rain
from the east and east-south-east, with a light topsail breeze; at
noon Latitude found 5 degrees 15 minutes, Longitude 181 degrees 16
minutes; course held north-west, sailed 25 miles. At noon we shaped
our course to westward. Variation 9 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>Still always good weather with a light breeze from the east and
north-east with occasional showers and smooth water; the swells
however are not running from the &nbsp;orth-east. At noon Latitude
observed 5 degrees 25 minutes, Longitude 180 degrees 20 minutes;
course kept west by south, sailed 14 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>The weather continuing good with smooth water and a weak
top-gallant breeze from the east and east-north-east trade-wind; at
noon Latitude estimated 5 degrees 2 minutes, Longitude 178 degrees
32 minutes; course held west, sailed 27 miles. At noon we saw land
straight ahead of us at about 4 miles distance; in order to run
north of it we set our course first west by north and then
west-north-west; towards evening we sailed close along the land
north-west. These islands are close upon thirty in number but very
small, the largest of them being not more than 2 miles in length;
the rest are all small fry, all of them being surrounded by a reef;
to north-west there runs off from this another reef on which there
are three coconut trees by which it is easily recognisable. These
are the islands which Le Maire has laid down in the chart; they are
at about 90 miles distance from the coast of New Guinea. In the
evening we still saw land north-north-west of us; we therefore
turned our course over to north-north-east close to the wind in
order to steer north of all shoals, brailed up our foresail, and in
this way drifted until daybreak.</p>

<p>To these isles we have given the name of Islands of Onthong
Faua, because of the great resemblance they bear to the latter;
they are also surrounded by reefs and appear as shown here when
they are south-west of you at 2 miles distance.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>At daybreak we made sail again, set our course to westward, and
then had the small islands we had passed the previous day south of
us at about 3 miles distance. The wind blew from the east and
north-east, with a dark grey sky and trade-wind weather. At noon
Latitude estimated 4 degrees 31 minutes South, Longitude 177
degrees 18 minutes; course held west-north-west, sailed 20 miles.
During the night at the end of the first watch we lay to and dared
not run on from fear we might come upon the island to which Le
Maire has given the name of Marcken.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>In the morning we made sail again, shaping our course to
westward. Towards noon we saw land right ahead of us; this land was
very low-lying and showed as two islands bearing south-west and
north-west from each other; the northernmost bears some resemblance
to the island of Marcken in the Zuyder Zee, as Jacob Le Maire says,
for which reason he gave to it the name of Marcken. At noon
Latitude observed 4 degrees 55 minutes, Longitude 175 degrees 30
minutes; course held west as far as we could estimate but we find
that there is a strong current setting to the south; we sailed 20
miles with a wind east and east-south-east, and trade-wind weather
with a light topsail breeze. In the evening we brought our course
round to north so as to run north of the island. During the night
we drifted in a calm and stood for the island aforesaid.</p>

<p>This island appears as here shown when it is west of you at 2
miles distance; this island has by Le Maire been named Marcken
because of the strong resemblance it shows with the said
island.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>In the day-watch we heard the surf break on the shore; it being
still quite calm we forthwith got out our pinnace and boat in order
to tow us clear of the reef or shoal; the current and the sea
however carried us some distance towards the reef. We found no
anchorage here which we greatly regretted. About 9 o'clock a prow
of the said island came alongside, containing 7 persons and about
20 coconuts; we exchanged a dozen of these for 3 strings of beads
and 4 double middle-sized nails; the said coconuts seemed to have
grown wild and were of poor quality. The people looked rough and
savage with blacker skins than those in the islands where we took
in refreshments; they were also less polite and went stark naked
except that they wore before their privities a small covering,
seemingly made of cotton, which was hardly large enough to conceal
from view their yard and testicles. Some of them had their hair cut
short, others wore it tied up like the villains of the Murderers
Bay. One of them wore two feathers right on the top of his head
just like horns; another wore a ring through his nose but we could
not find out what the ring was made of; their prow was sharply
pointed in front and behind like the wings of a seagull, but not
elegantly shaped and rather the worse for wear and tear; they
carried arrows and two bows and did not seem to set any store by
the beads and nails, nay utterly to despise the same. We then got
the wind from the south and fortunately got off the reef with the
aid of it. The prow then paddled off to shore again. We saw another
small prow approach us but it could not come near us in consequence
of a sudden gust of wind. We now set our course to northward in
order to get clear of the shoals and reefs. These islands are 15 or
16 in number, the largest of them being about a mile in length, and
the other looking like houses; they all lie together surrounded by
a reef. The said reef runs off from the islands to the north-west
side; at about a swivel-gun shot distance from the islands there
stands a group of trees, level with the water; two miles farther to
the north-west there is another small islet like Toppershoetje (a
small sailor's hat) the reef extends another half mile farther into
the sea so that the reef runs out to sea in a north-westerly
direction fully 3 miles from the islands. At noon Latitude
estimated 4 degrees 34 minutes South, Longitude 175 degrees 10
minutes; course held north-west, sailed 7 miles; about noon the
wind went round to north-west and then to northward; we turned our
course west, after which began to blow from the north-north-east
with a light breeze, upon which we set our course to the
north-west; during the night, the weather being quiet with a
northerly wind, we turned more to westward.</p>

<p>Item the 26th.</p>

<p>Good weather and smooth water with a north-easterly wind and a
light breeze. At noon Latitude observed 4 degrees 33 minutes,
Longitude 174 degrees 30 minutes; course held west, sailed 10
miles. We found that there was a strong current here setting
southward, on which account we turned our course north-westward
again. Variation 9 degrees 30 minutes North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>Wind and weather as before. At noon Latitude observed 4 degrees
1 minute, Longitude 173 degrees 36 minutes; course held north-west
by west, sailed 16 miles; at noon we shaped our course to westward
in order to run in sight of the islands lying eastward to the coast
of New Guinea, and thence to cross to the mainland coast, which
will thus become better known. Variation 9 degrees 30 minutes
North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 28th.</p>

<p>Still good weather, the wind blowing from the east with a light
breeze and smooth water. At noon Latitude observed 4 degrees 11
minutes, Longitude 172 degrees 32 minutes; course held west, sailed
16 miles; towards noon we saw land straight ahead and at noon we
were still at about 4 miles distance from it. This island is in 4
degrees 31 minutes South Latitude and 172 degrees 16 minutes
Longitude; it lies 46 miles to the west and west by north of the
islands which Jacob Le Maire had named Marcken. During the night we
drifted in a calm.</p>

<p>To these islands Le Maire has given the name of Green Islands
because they looked green and beautiful; they appear as shown here
when the easternmost is south and the westernmost south-west of you
at 2 miles distance.</p>

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>In the morning we found that the current was setting us towards
the islands. At noon Latitude observed 4 degrees 20 minutes,
Longitude 172 degrees 17 minutes. The whole of this day we drifted
in a calm so that in the last twenty-four hours we have drifted 5
miles to the south-west. Halfway the afternoon two small prows came
from shore alongside; they had two wings or outriggers, their
paddles being small and thick in the blade, poorly made as it
seemed to us; one of the prows had 6, the other 3 men in it. When
they were about 2 ship's lengths from us one of the six men who
were in the one prow broke one of his arrows in two, put one half
into his hair and held the other half in his hand, apparently
wishing thereby to show friendly feelings towards us; these men
were stark naked, their bodies quite black, with curly hair like
Caffres, but not so woolly as the hair of the latter, nor were
their noses quite as flat. Some wore white bracelets, seemingly of
bone, round their arms; others had their faces daubed with lime,
and wore on the forehead a piece of tree-bark about the breadth of
three fingers. They carried nothing but arrows, bows and calleweys
(javelins) we called out to them a few words from our vocabulary of
the language of New Guinea but the only word they seemed to
understand was Lamas, which means coconuts. They always kept
pointing to the land. We presented them with two strings of beads
and two large nails, together with an old napkin, in return for
which they gave us an old coconut which was all they had with them,
after which they paddled to shore again. Towards the evening it was
still calm with a very light breeze from the north-east; we drifted
quite close to the islands and had to get out the boats to keep us
off the shore by towing. At the close of the dog-watch we at length
got clear of these islands. There are two large islands and three
small ones, the latter lying on the west side. To these islands Le
Maire has given the name of the Green islands. West-north-west of
us we still saw a high island with 2 or 3 very small ones, and to
westward of us we besides saw some very high land which looked like
a mainland coast. But the truth of this only time can show.
Variation 9 degrees North-East.</p>

<p>Item the 30th.</p>

<p>Weather improving with a light breeze from the north-east; still
engaged in towing; we found that the current was setting us to the
southward. At noon Latitude observed 4 degrees 25 minutes,
Longitude 172 degrees; course held west, sailed or drifted 4 miles;
in the evening we had St. Jans island north-west of us at about 6
miles distance.</p>

<p>Item the last.</p>

<p>Still good and quiet weather, with an easterly wind and smooth
water. At noon Latitude observed 4 degrees 28 minutes, Longitude
171 degrees 42 minutes; course held west, sailed 6 miles; at noon
we hoisted the white flag and pendant, upon which our friends of
the Zeehaan came on board of us, with whom we resolved upon what is
in extenso set forth in this day's resolution.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of April, A.D. 1643.</p>

<p>We got the coast of New Guinea alongside in 4 degrees 30 minutes
South Latitude, at a point which the Spaniards call Cabo Santa
Maria. At noon Latitude observed 4 degrees 30 minutes, Longitude
171 degrees 2 minutes; course held west, sailed 10 miles. Variation
8 degrees 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>Still good, quiet weather, with a variable breeze. We did our
best to sail along the coast which here bears from Sint Jans island
north-west and south-east; north-west of this there is still
another high island, somewhat larger than St. Jans island from
which it is 10 miles distant; to this second island we have given
the name of Anthony Caens island. This is situated due north of
Cabo Santa Maria. At noon Latitude observed 4 degrees 9 minutes,
Longitude 170 degrees 41 minutes; course held north-west, sailed 10
miles; we then had Cabo Santa Maria south of us so that the cabo
aforesaid lies in longitude 170 degrees 41 minutes, according to
our estimation. In the evening we ran inshore in order to make
better progress with the land-wind. When four glasses in the first
watch were out we got the wind from shore with a light breeze and
shaped our course along the shore.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>In the morning there was still a light land-breeze, our course
still north-west along the coast. About 9 o'clock we saw a vessel
full of men coming from shore; the said vessel was curved at both
ends like the corre-corre of Tarnaten; she lay still a while beyond
the reach of our great guns and then returned to shore again. At
noon Latitude estimated 3 degrees 42 minutes South, Longitude 170
degrees 20 minutes; course held north-west, sailed 10 miles.
Towards evening the wind began to blow from the east-south-east
with a light breeze; we kept steering north-west along the coast.
This land seems to be very pleasant but the worst of it was that we
could get no anchorage here. During the night we had thunder and
lightning, with rain and variable breezes.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>We still kept sailing along the coast which here stretched
north-west by west and south-east by east. It is a beautiful coast
with many bays. We passed an island situated at 12 miles distance
from Anthony Caens island, the two bearing from each other
north-west and south-east. To this island we have given the name of
Gardenys island. At noon Latitude estimated 3 degrees 22 minutes,
Longitude 169 degrees 50 minutes; course held north-west by west,
sailed 9 miles; the wind still variable with light breezes and
calms; in the evening we got the land-wind, with rain, thunder and
lightning; we therefore did our best to sail along the shore.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>In the morning we still had the land-wind with a light breeze.
Towards noon we came upon another island at 10 miles distance from
Gardenys island, the two bearing from each other west-north-west
and east-south-east. Inshore of this island we saw some prows
lying, which we supposed to be engaged in fishing, for which reason
we have to this island given the name of Fishers island. Towards
noon we saw 6 prows ahead of us, three of which came paddling so
near our ship that we let 2 or three pieces of old canvas, 2
strings of beads and two old nails drift towards them; they did not
seem to care for the canvas, and the other things too hardly
excited their attention; but they kept pointing to their heads,
from which we concluded that they wanted turbans. These people
seemed to be very shy, and by their gestures afraid of shot; they
did not come near enough for us to discern whether they were armed.
They were very black and stark naked, having only their privities
covered with a few green leaves. Some of them had black hair,
others hair of another colour. Their prows had outriggers and each
of them carried 3 or 4 persons, but owing to the distance we could
not discern any other details. When they had thus been pottering a
long while near about the ships, and at times called out to us, to
which we replied in the same way, though we did not understand each
other, they paddled back to shore. At noon Latitude estimated 3
degrees, Longitude 169 degrees 17 minutes; course held
west-north-west, sailed 10 miles; in the afternoon we had the wind
north-west with a light breeze.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>In the morning it was calm. Halfway the forenoon we again saw 8
or 9 prows come from the said island, three of which paddled to the
Zeehaan and 5 to our ship. Some of them contained 3, others 4, and
some few 5 persons. When they were about two stones cast from us
they left off paddling and called out to us; we could not
understand them but made signs for them to come nearer, upon which
they paddled round in front of our ship, and kept loitering ahead
of us a long time without coming alongside. At length one of our
quartermasters took off his belt and held it up to them from afar.
Upon this one of these prows came alongside our ship; we gave them
a string of beads and our quartermaster also handed his belt out to
them, for &nbsp;which all we got in return was a piece of the pith
of a sago-tree, which was the only commodity they had with them.
Meanwhile the other prows, seeing that their comrades received no
hurt, also came paddling alongside. None of these prows contained
any arms or anything with which they could have done us harm. We at
first suspected they might be villains who were intent on mischief
and in search of booty since they affected such timidity. Had our
suspicions proved true they would have been warmly received, for
which we had made all due preparations, although the cook was not
ready yet with the morning meal. We called out to them the words
Anieuw, Oufi, Pouacka, etc. (meaning coconuts, yams, hogs, etc.)
which they seemed to understand, for they pointed to the shore as
if they wanted to say: they are there. Then they paddled to shore
with great quickness and regularity but, since the breeze began to
freshen, we did not see them again. These natives are dark brown,
nay almost as black as the blackest Caffre; they have hair of
various colours, owing to the lime with which they powder it; their
faces are smeared with red paint except their foreheads. Some of
them wore a thick bone through the lower part of the nose, about
half the thickness of a little finger. For the rest they wore
nothing on their bodies except some green leaves covering their
privities. Their prows were new, trimly made up, and adorned with
wood-carving in front and behind, with one outrigger each; their
paddles were not long or broad, and pointed at the end, etc. At
noon the wind went round to south-east with a fair breeze; we
shaped our course west by north along the coast; Latitude observed
2 degrees 53 minutes, Longitude 168 degrees 59 minutes; course held
west-north-west, sailed 5 miles; in the afternoon we made good
progress. During the night there was land-wind with a light
breeze.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>In the morning we continued drifting in a calm. In the forenoon
there came again 20 prows hovering near and about the ships but,
like those of the previous day, they kept out of reach of gun-shot.
We repeatedly made signs to them upon which they at length made
bold to paddle alongside of us. They had nothing in their prows
except in one of them three coconuts, of which we got one in
exchange for a string of beads. We thought we should have got all
three of them for it, but they absolutely refused to part with the
other two. Another man had a shark (which in their tongue they
called Ilacxz) which we also bartered against three strings of
beads; a third again had a dorado or dolphin, which one of our
sailors exchanged for an old cap. Some of them had a number of
small fishes which they threw to our men, but they proved not worth
eating. Finally three or four of these people came on board of our
ship, looked about them in great amazement, and walked about the
ship as if they were intoxicated; a curious circumstance truly, for
in their small prows they paddled about for miles out to sea
without any signs of sea-sickness, but in a large ship like ours
they seem to get intoxicated by the motion caused of the swell of
the sea. They had no arms with them, or anything which they could
have hurt us. They seemed to subsist by fishing for some of them
carried wooden eel-spears. After they had been on board for a while
they left together and paddled back to shore with a good deal of
bustle and with loud shouts. We remained lying there during the
afternoon or drifted in a calm. Farther to westward the land begins
to be very low, but the coast stretched west by north and
west-north-west as far as we could see. At noon Latitude estimated
2 degrees 35 minutes, Longitude 168 degrees 25 minutes; course held
west by north, sailed 9 miles. In the afternoon we still saw high
land west by north and west of the cape aforesaid; this land we
estimated to be fully 10 miles from us. We drifted in a calm but,
soon getting a light breeze from the eastward, we endeavoured to
get near the highland to westward. The current setting along this
coast is steadily in our favour so that every day we made more
progress to westward than we apparently proceeded over the water.
In the course of the night we passed a large bay or inlet.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>In the morning, reaching the west side of the bay, we came upon
four small low-lying islets along which we held our course; when we
were past these islets we again came upon 3 small islets lying
together west of the others which we had passed at noon. At noon
Latitude estimated 2 degrees 26 minutes, Longitude 167 degrees 39
minutes, the wind blowing from the east-south-east but variable;
course held west by north, sailed 12 miles. Variation 10 degrees
North-East. South-west by west of us we had a low-lying cape, north
of which there were two low islets. From this point the land begins
gradually to fall away to southward. About 6 o'clock in the evening
we had these two islets south by west of us and the nearest land we
saw, being level and low-lying, lay south-west by south of us at
about 4 miles distance. We all the time held our course along the
coast.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>In the morning at sunrise we drifted in a calm; the point of the
southernmost land we saw lay south-east by east of us at about 2
1/2 miles distance where the coast falls off very abruptly. We then
had another low-lying small islet south-south-west of us at about 2
miles distance. We did our best to sail close along the said point
but were prevented from so doing owing to the calm. At noon
Latitude observed 2 degrees 33 minutes, Longitude 167 degrees 4
minutes; course held west-south-west, sailed 7 miles. Variation 10
degrees. In the afternoon we steered for the point as before.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>During the last twenty-four hours we made pretty good progress
to southward. Owing to the calm and for other reasons we
endeavoured to get to southward as quickly as possible, partly to
explore the coasts and partly to find a passage southward. At noon
we found the southernmost point to bear from us east-north-east and
the northernmost ditto north-north-east. At noon Latitude observed
3 degrees 2 minutes, Longitude 167 degrees 4 minutes; course held
south, sailed 12 miles. In the afternoon we kept steering south;
towards evening the wind went round to north-north-west. In order
to get near to the land again we shaped our course east-south-east
and south-east, at times rough, light variable winds with rain
greatly troubling us. After midnight we again drifted in a calm in
smooth water.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>At noon we drifted in a calm without being able to take the
latitude. We still saw the land stretching north-east of us, to wit
the most easterly point, the most westerly point bearing from us
north-north-east and north by east. At noon Latitude estimated 3
degrees 28 minutes, Longitude 166 degrees 51 minutes; course kept
south-west by west, half a point westerly, sailed 7 miles. In the
second watch we had a light breeze from the east-north-east; we
turned our course over to south-east close by the wind but
afterwards it fell a calm again.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>Three glasses in the day-watch having run out we felt so violent
a shock of earthquake that none of our men, however sound asleep,
remained in his hammock, but all came running on deck in amazement,
thinking the ship had struck on a rock. The feeling was as if the
keel were dragging over coral rock but when we cast the lead we got
no bottom. After this there were repeated slight shocks of
earthquake, but none so strong as the first; at first with calm
weather but shortly afterwards with heavy rains; the wind variable
and sometimes a calm. We endeavoured to get as far to southward as
possible. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon the wind was west with a
light breeze. At noon Latitude observed 3 degrees 45 minutes,
Longitude 167 degrees 1 minute; course held south-south-east,
sailed 6 miles. Afterwards we turned our course due south-east and
then saw a small, round, low-lying islet south by west of us at 4
1/2 or 5 miles distance. During the night heavy rains with variable
weather.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind came from the north-east with a light
breeze; we saw high land with several mountains and low-lying land
between them from the south-west by west to the east-south-east. As
far as we could make out we were in a large bay. We kept doing our
best to get southward. At noon Latitude estimated 4 degrees 22
minutes, Longitude 167 degrees 18 minutes; course held
south-south-east, sailed 10 miles. In the afternoon we drifted in a
calm without being able to take soundings; the water here is as
smooth as in a river without any motion, which made us the more
believe we were in a large bay; but what the truth is we shall
learn in time. During the night we had variable winds with now and
then a calm. In the evening we had some mountains and hills
south-south-west of us, towards which we shaped our course as much
as possible.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>In the morning we saw land from the east-north-east to the
south-south-west and afterwards in the west-south-west. We hoped
(although in vain) to find a passage between the two, but when we
came nearer we found that it was a bay, and that the land all
joined to westward. Therefore with a north-north-west wind we
shaped our course west by south as high as we could sail, and about
3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon came upon a reef which we judged to
be usually level with the water, and which with the present
sea-wind we could hardly sail clear of, the said reef lying 2 miles
from shore as near as we could estimate. At noon Latitude observed
5 degrees 27 minutes, Longitude 166 degrees 57 minutes; course held
south-south-west, sailed 15 miles. Variation 9 degrees 15 minutes
North-East. Towards evening we got a light breeze from the
north-north-east. During the night we again drifted in a calm.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>We continued to have variable winds and calms so that we made
little progress. At noon Latitude estimated 5 degrees 18 minutes,
Longitude 166 degrees 36 minutes; course held west-north-west,
sailed 6 miles. Variation 9 degrees North-East. In the evening the
high island was due north-west of us at 6 miles distance.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>We kept drifting in a calm and had the most westerly land we saw
west by south and west-south-west of us. The land here from the one
point to the other begins to extend mainly west by north, and shows
from time to time high mountains with some pleasant, large, deep
valleys. In the evening the high island was north-west by north of
us at 2 1/2 or 3 miles distance. At noon Latitude estimated 5
degrees 5 minutes, Longitude 166 degrees 27 minutes; course held
north-west, sailed 4 miles. Through the whole night we had calm
weather.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>In the morning we still drifted in a calm; about three hours
before noon we had the high island north-east of us at 3 miles
distance. We then got a light breeze from the south-east, upon
which we set our course due west. We now had the two islands
opposite each other. At noon Latitude observed 5 degrees 8 minutes,
Longitude 166 degrees; course held west, half a point northerly,
sailed 8 miles. Variation 8 degrees 45 minutes North-East. In the
afternoon we again drifted in a calm; in the evening at sunset the
high island was east by north of us at 6 or 7 miles distance, and
the western extremity of a high range of mountains in New Guinea
south-west by south of us at 6 or 7 miles distance. During the
night it was calm again.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>In the morning at sunrise the high mountain aforesaid was south
by west of us at 6 or 7 miles distance. In the forenoon we got a
light breeze from the south-west, upon which we turned our course
over to westward, as close to the wind as possible, in smooth
water. At noon Latitude observed 5 degrees, Longitude 165 degrees
37 minutes; course held west by north and west-north-west, sailed 5
miles with variable winds and a calm now and then. At noon the high
mountain was south of us; at about four o'clock in the afternoon it
was south by east of us so that since noon we had drifted about 2
miles to westward. We next saw where the land extended to westward,
another high mountain south-west by south of us. The wind being
south-south-west, then but very light, we turned our course over to
westward close by the wind; at night we had a fair breeze from the
south-east but already at the end of the second watch it fell calm
again.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>In the forenoon we had a light breeze from the south, our course
being west-south-west. At noon Latitude observed 5 degrees 9
minutes, Longitude 164 degrees 50 minutes; course held west by
south, sailed 12 miles. Variation 9 degrees North-East. At noon we
had a round high islet, situated three miles off the mainland coast
of New Guinea, due south of us at 2 1/2 miles distance. We set our
course west-south-west, after which west by north of us we also saw
land, which was supposed to be islands since we found the mainland
coast of New Guinea to extend due west only. In the afternoon, the
wind being south-east, we still stuck to our west-south-west
course. At two o'clock in the afternoon we came upon a rocky reef
which was only a fathom under water; from the masthead we saw,
northward of the reef aforesaid, several more small reefs, between
which the sea seemed to be deep; we ran round south of them and saw
more reefs still, south of us. We accordingly passed between the
two groups of reefs, and in quiet weather set our course
west-south-west. We had the round high island which at noon was
south of us, south-east of us now at a distance of about four
miles, so that this reef aforesaid is north-west by west of the
high round island at 4 miles distance. This reef is in 5 degrees 10
or 12 minutes South Latitude. The most northerly point of the
mountains, which we had up to now taken to be islands, was
west-north-west of us at about 7 miles distance, which indications
will be sufficient to recognise these shoals by in future. In the
evening the southern point of a high island was west by north of us
at about 5 1/2 or 6 miles distance; we set our course as much due
west as we could, with light variable winds.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>At noon we had the most southerly point of the island north-west
by west of us at 2 or 2 1/2 miles distance; in the evening the
centre of the island was north-east of us at 1 1/2 miles distance,
and the south point of another and higher island west-north-west of
us at 6 or 7 miles distance. We set our course west by north. At
noon Latitude observed 5 degrees 4 minutes, Longitude 164 degrees
27 minutes; course held west by north, sailed 6 miles with variable
winds and an occasional calm. Variation 8 degrees 30 minutes. In
the evening we again drifted in a calm, but shortly after the wind
became east with a fair breeze. At night at the setting of the
second watch we came close to the island and saw a large flame
issue steadily from the top of the mountain. This is the volcano
which Willem Schouten refers to in his journal. In order to pass
between the mainland of New Guinea and this island we drifted the
night without sails set, and thus waited for the day. While
drifting we constantly heard the heavy ripple of the current which
carried us to westward, which was greatly in our favour. On the
same island we saw many fires close to the water, and also halfway
up the high mountains, so we concluded it to be a thickly peopled
country; it lies in the latitude of ---- degrees ----&nbsp;
minutes. As we were here sailing along the coast of New Guinea we
had frequent calms and constantly saw pieces of wood floating
about, the size of small trees, also bamboos and other lumber from
shore, coming down the rivers, which made us conclude that there
must be many rivers, and that it must be a fine country. We held
our course north-west along the coast.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>In the morning the centre of the island was east of us at 3
miles distance, the south-east point being east-south-east and
south-east by east, the northern point north-east by east of us;
the nearest land on the mainland coast was south-west of us at 1
1/2 or 1 3/4 miles distance. We then saw one more island north-west
of us at about 8 miles distance, which Willem Schouten had named
the high islands, and that justly since it is very high. At noon
Latitude observed 4 degrees 30 minutes, Longitude 163 degrees 13
minutes; course held west by north, sailed 20 miles with a variable
wind. In the evening at sunset the wind became east with a light
breeze. We had sailed to the north-west since noon, and now shaped
our course north-west by west with a fair breeze, and afterwards
west-north-west, so that in the evening the centre of the island
was due north-west of us at 4 miles distance. At the close the 6th
glass in the first watch, as we were in the narrowest part of the
passage between the mainland and the island, we found that at this
point of the mainland of New Guinea there begins a low-lying coast
which then trends west-north-west and north-west by west.
Accordingly at the end of the first watch we took in all sails and
let the ship drift with only the mizzen-sail set in order to await
the day and avoid all perils; but since the current was setting
here to the west we made more progress as measured by the land we
passed than was apparent from our advance over the water. The
mountain burnt with a steady flame issuing straight from the
top.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>In the morning in the day-watch we again made sail and set our
course to west-north-west. At sunrise we got into very
pale-coloured water and at first thought we had come upon a shoal,
for which reason we forthwith turned our course to the north. At
this time we had the high burning mountain east-south-east and
south-east by east of us at 7 miles distance. At night the flames
were very violent. We had another high but small island
north-north-east of us at 4 or 5 miles distance; the most westerly
point of the mainland we saw being west-north-west of us at 4 miles
distance, and a large river south-south-west of us at 2 miles
distance. The north-north-west course lies between two high islets
situated close together. Westward of these we saw still more land,
to wit, three more islands. The mainland coast here extends chiefly
to west-north-west. We took soundings here but found no bottom
although we had sailed one mile from the low-lying land. We again
set our course west-north-west along the coast, and this day passed
six small islets, all of which we left on our starboard. At noon
Latitude observed 3 degrees 39 minutes, Longitude 161 degrees 38
minutes, the wind being east and east-south-east, also at times
east-north-east but variable; course held west-north-west, half a
point northerly; sailed 27 miles. In the afternoon we got a fair
breeze from the east-north-east; course held as before. We found
here a low-lying land full of rivers, and saw many trunks of trees
and other wood, together with a great quantity of green brushwod,
come floating from the rivers with a flow of whitish sandy water.
This low land forms a cape here, and when you have passed this
point the land trends away to westward, so that a large bay is
formed here, the two points however bearing from each other
west-north-west. In the evening the eastern extremity of the most
westerly island of the six was north-east by north of us at 1 1/2
miles distance. We had at that time another high island alongside
west by north of us at 5 miles distance; we set our course
west-north-west and north-west by west. At the end of the first
watch we had the centre of the island south-west of us at one mile
distance; we then set our course west-north-west with an easterly
wind; at midnight a heavy shower of rain.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind continued easterly; we kept our course
west-north-west as before. In the forenoon we passed so much wood,
pieces of tree-trunks, bamboo and other brushwood that it seemed as
if we were sailing in a river, from all which we concluded that
there must be a great river hereabouts and, since the current set
us from the land, we shaped our course to westward and afterward
west by south in order to get the coast alongside again. At noon
Latitude estimated 3 degrees 1 minute, Longitude 160 degrees 3
minutes, the wind blowing from the east, course held
west-north-west, sailed 26 miles. At two o'clock in the afternoon
we again came near the mainland coast; in the evening we again set
our course west-north-west, straight along the coast. In the
afternoon a prow came to the Zeehaan from the mainland.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>In the morning course and wind as before, with a fair breeze; at
noon we took no latitude, though the weather was good; we estimated
ourselves to be in Latitude 2 degrees 22 minutes South, Longitude
158 degrees 36 minutes, the wind east; course held west-north-west,
sailed 26 miles. Variation 8 degrees North-East. In the afternoon
we had rain, but at night at the end of the second watch we saw
straight ahead low land with fires; we lay to with one sail close
to the wind in order to await the day and drifted. During the night
Latitude observed 2 degrees 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>In the morning at daybreak we again made sail, and with an
easterly wind shaped our course to westward towards the land we had
seen during the night with the fires on the said land. We found it
to consist of three low-lying islets, lying near to the mainland
coast, about 5 miles to the eastward of the island of Moa, which we
got sight of shortly afterwards. We then steered for the said
island of Moa and made for the roadstead on the west side of the
island, casting anchor in 12 fathom, good, grey, sandy bottom. This
day we had much rain, the sea running fast from the north-west.
When we had cast anchor a large number of small prows came swarming
near and about our ships, loitering a long while before venturing
to come alongside. We therefore tied a number of beads to pieces of
firewood, which we threw out to them, on which almost all of them
came on board of us, bringing with them no more than three
coconuts. Making use of Jacob Le Maire's Vocabulary we gave them to
understand that we wanted hogs, fowls, coconuts, bananas, and other
refreshments, upon which they paddled to shore to fetch them, and
returned towards noon, bringing with them, some four, others 5 or 6
coconuts, with a lot of unripe bananas, all of which we obtained of
them by barter, 5 or 6 for an old nail or a string of beads, and 12
or 14 coconuts for a knife; they also brought us some fish both
smoked and fresh. At noon Latitude observed 2 degrees 11 minutes,
Longitude 156 degrees 47 minutes; the wind east, course held west
by north, sailed 28 miles. In the evening when all the prows had
left us we sent our pinnace to fetch our friends of the Zeehaan on
board of us, with whom we resolved upon what is in extenso set
forth in this day's resolution to which we beg leave to refer.</p>

<p>Item the 26th.</p>

<p>Early in the morning again a large number of prows with coconuts
and unripe bananas came alongside. It seemed that the natives here
had nothing else to dispose of. This day we obtained by barter so
many coconuts that each of the men of our crew got five of them,
but the natives brought little else than coconuts and unripe
bananas, together with some fish, both fresh and smoked, all of
which commodities we obtained of them by barter. This day we had 2
low-lying islets west of us. About 4 o'clock in the afternoon we
sighted the island of Arymoa, north-west by west of us at 8 or 9
miles distance according to our estimation. As we were lying off
the island here we found the wind to blow north-east from the sea
by day, and south-east from the land by night; we also found the
current to set here steadily to westward at such a rate that in a
calm we should be sure to drift 4, 5 or 6 miles in twenty-four
hours. The prows of the natives here are very narrow, about a foot
in breadth.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind was south-west. Latitude observed here 2
degrees 10 minutes, Longitude 156 degrees 47 minutes. This day
there came again a large number of prows alongside our ships, some
of them from other islands in the neighbourhood and others from the
mainland, bringing nothing but coconuts, unripe bananas and some
fresh and smoked fish, almost all of which we obtained by barter.
Among the said prows there were two large ones with 18 or 20 men in
each of them, all of them armed with bows and arrows, and also with
javelins and harpoons. These natives were almost quite black and
went naked, having only a small covering to hide their privities
from view. They could all of them exactly imitate whatever words
they heard our men pronounce, a sure sign that their language is
copious and difficult to pronounce, which we also infer from their
using the letter R in so many of their words, some of them even
containing as many as three R's. This day we got so many coconuts
that we served out 6 coconuts and some bananas to each of our men.
In the evening we again summoned our friends of the Zeehaan on
board of us, and represented to them that we had come to the
conclusion that we were lying not before Moa, but before Jamna, and
asked them whether they did not think it best for us to weigh
anchor tomorrow before daybreak and run for Moa, where we are
likely to get more refreshments than here, which was assented to by
the council, as may be seen from today's resolution.</p>

<p>Item the 28th.</p>

<p>In the morning at 4 glasses in the day-watch we weighed anchor
and sailed with small sail to the island of Moa, where we dropped
anchor at about noon in 10 fathom, stiff ground. As soon as we had
dropped anchor numerous prows with coconuts and bananas came
alongside. At noon Latitude estimated 2 degrees 5 minutes,
Longitude 156 degrees 28 minutes; course held west by north, sailed
5 miles. In the afternoon at the end of 6 glasses there came a
large prow from the mainland with 19 men in her, bringing a number
of coconuts, which those on board the Zeehaan obtained by barter.
This day we got so many coconuts by exchange that we served out 6
of them to each of our men.</p>

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>In the morning again a large number of small prows came
alongside with coconuts, unripe bananas, etc., which we all
obtained by giving in exchange old nails, beads and knives, so that
this day we served out 4 coconuts to each of our men. Towards the
evening a large number of prows came alongside among them one with
11 persons in her, bringing with them a large quantity of coconuts
which we all obtained of them by barter. Towards the evening we
summoned on board of us our friends of the Zeehaan with whom we
resolved to weigh anchor and proceed on our voyage as soon as wind
and tide should serve.</p>

<p>Item the last.</p>

<p>In the morning a strong wind was blowing from the
west-north-west, and the sea running very high, so that during all
this day we could do nothing to give effect to our resolution of
the previous day, to set sail from Moa and continue our voyage, but
were compelled to remain at anchor. This day we again obtained by
barter a number of coconuts, as many as the natives brought to our
ships.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of May.</p>

<p>As the wind still continued west-north-west we had to remain at
anchor, since we had the current against us, so that we should have
done no good by trying to tack; this day we got some more
coconuts.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>We still remained at anchor because the west-north-west wind
kept blowing with a stiff, steady breeze, and the current was
setting steadily to eastward. We had rain now and then but most of
the time dry weather. In the forenoon we got still a large number
of coconuts, but in the afternoon no more prows came alongside
owing to the stiff breeze. During the night we had pretty good
weather and always west wind.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>In the morning several prows again came alongside. Our men being
engaged in washing the deck, one of our sailors standing on the
wales to hand up the bucket, was shot at with an arrow and hit in
the thick part of the leg above the thigh; we immediately made some
of our men fire among the prows with muskets, so that one of the
natives was hit in the arm. Shortly after we weighed anchor, ran
inwards to the spot where Jacob Le Maire had formerly been at
anchor with the ship Eendracht, and dropped our anchor from the
bows between the two islands in smooth water. The natives on shore,
seeing that we came sailing inwards with both ships, waved with
branches and seemed full of fear that we might come with hostile
intentions. They immediately sent on board of us the man who had
been discharging arrows against our ship to make his peace with us
which was done. Then the other natives again came on board as
before, but they did not venture to demand as much for their
commodities as before, and were content to take what we offered
them. This day we again got a few prows alongside with coconuts,
which we all obtained of them by barter, so that we could serve out
9 coconuts to each of our men.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind kept always blowing from the
west-north-west, so that we were forced to remain here; this day
again numerous prows came alongside with coconuts, which we all
obtained of them by exchange, so that we could serve out 7 coconuts
to each of our men.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>The west-north-west wind still continuing in the morning we
remained lying at anchor. This day we got only a few coconuts on
board, all of them very young ones, so that it would seem that most
of the coconuts of this island had already been gathered.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>About 8 o'clock in the morning there sprung up a light
land-breeze, so that we weighed our anchors and set sail in order
to continue our voyage. We were already under sail when some more
prows with coconuts came alongside. From these islands, both Hamna
and Moa, we have got 6000 coconuts for the two ships, and about 100
bunches of bananas, all which we obtained by barter for beads, old
rusty nails, and pieces of iron hoops, which we ground on one side,
and to which we fitted wooden handles so as to resemble knives, for
which they were very eager. When we had got to a quarter of a mile
distance outside the bay it fell calm so that we had to drop anchor
in 9 fathom, stiff ground.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind went about slightly to landward but
inclining to a calm; we continued trying to get a little more off
the land. In the forenoon the wind was west by south with a fair
breeze, course held north-north-west. In the afternoon the wind
became north-north-west, on which we tacked about, steering west by
south. In the evening at the setting of the first watch of the
island Arymoa was north-west of us at about 3 miles distance; we
then turned our course over to northward again and kept our course
north by west without making much progress, since the sea ran very
strong from the north-west. During the night the wind was
west-south-west.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>In the morning at sunrise we had the largest island of Arymoa
due south-west of us at about 3 miles distance; the wind continued
west by south and west-south-west; course still held
north-north-west. In the afternoon we had good weather. Latitude
observed 1 degree 30 minutes, Longitude 156 degrees 22 minutes;
course held north by west, sailed 8 3/4 miles. Variation 8 degrees
North-East. We had the most north-westerly point of the island of
Arymoa south-west and south-west by south of us at 5 or 6 miles
distance. We then turned our course over to south-west with a
west-north-west wind and a light breeze. In the evening at sunset
we had the western point of the island of Arymoa south-west by
south of us at about 3 1/2 miles distance in calm weather with the
wind west-north-west; we still tacked to south-west. During the
first and second watch of the night we drifted in a calm, the sea
still running from the west-north-west. At the end of the second
watch we got a light breeze from the south-east upon which we set
our course due west.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind was south by east inclining to a calm.
At sunrise we had the island of Arymoa south by east of us at about
3 or 4 miles distance; we still continued to steer west. At noon we
got a light breeze from the north. The island of Arymoa then lay
south-east by east of us at 3 or 4 miles distance, our course being
always west. At noon Latitude observed 1 degree 35 minutes,
Longitude 155 degrees 25 minutes; course held west by south, sailed
7 miles. Variation 7 degrees 30 minutes. In the afternoon the wind
became north-north-west with good weather. In the evening at sunset
the north side of Arymoa lay east by south of us at 7 miles
distance. We took soundings here in 67 fathom, at about 3 miles
distance from the mainland, which was very low-lying here. The wind
being north-west we made for the coast and got into gradually
shallowing water, 50, 40, 30 and 35, all good bottom; when 6
glasses in the first watch were out we sounded in 24 fathom, upon
which we tacked about, since the wind at times was blowing more
from shore, so that when about midnight the wind had gone round to
south-west we set our course north-west along the coast.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind was south, our course remaining as
before. We continually sailed here in thick muddy water of green
colour, along a low coast which, by reason of this discharge of
water, we supposed to be full of rivers, but we remained so far
from shore that we could not well discern any rivers. Before noon
having set our course north-west we found that the current caused
by the discharge of the rivers was steadily setting us off the
land. At noon Latitude observed 1 degree 17 minutes, Longitude 155
degrees 12 minutes; course held west-north-west, sailed 12 miles
with variable winds. In the afternoon the wind abated and in the
evening in the first watch we drifted in a calm; in the second
watch the wind was variable.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>At noon the wind came from the south-east with a light breeze.
We turned our course west by south in order to get the land
alongside again since we did not see any. At noon Latitude observed
1 degree 3 minutes, Longitude 154 degrees 28 minutes; course held
west, sailed 12 miles. Variation 6 degrees 50 minutes North-East.
In the evening with a south-south-east wind we set our course due
west. All through the night we had a fair breeze with occasional
calms. It seems however that the wind is getting to some extent
influenced by the eastern monsoon. This day we had smooth water;
the clouds which for some time past had been driving from the
north-west were now at a standstill. We passed some low-lying land
here.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind was east by north, our course being
west. We again saw land, lying west by south of us, and set our
course straight for it, when we found it to be Willem Schoutens
island. At noon we had the northern point of it due west of us at
about 6 miles distance in good weather. At noon Latitude observed
54 degrees, Longitude 153 degrees 17 minutes, with an
east-south-east wind; course held west, sailed 18 miles. We
continued sailing along it. About an hour before sunset 6 prows put
off from Schoutens island to have a look at us, each prow
containing 20, 24, or 25 men, but they were too shy to come
alongside; these prows were about the length of the vessels of the
Moluccas, but not so broad; the men were very expert paddlers, and
seemed to be quick and intelligent; this land, about 18 or 19 miles
in length, seems to be fairly well populated. In the evening at
sunset we had the northern point of Willem Schoutens island
west-south-west of us at about 1 1/2 miles distance, so that we
constantly saw the surf break on the shore. This day in the evening
a heavy slow swell rose, coming from the north; what it means we
shall learn in time. The wind still blowing from the east with a
light breeze. In the evening we set our course west towards the
most westerly point so that we sailed along the coast all
night.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>In the morning we were at about 2 miles distance from the
western point of Willem Schoutens island, which was almost due
south-west by south of us; another islet, lying north-west by north
of the point just mentioned at about 3 or 4 miles distance, bore
from us north-west. We kept sailing westward along the coast until
the said point was east of us, and then, in order to get the
mainland coast alongside again, we set our course west-south-west.
In the afternoon we got the wind from the south with a fair breeze.
At noon Latitude estimated 54 minutes, Longitude 152 degrees 6
minutes; course held west, sailed 18 miles with an east wind.
Variation 6 degrees 30 minutes North-East. In the afternoon the
wind turned to the south-east with rainy weather. We then sighted
land again, south-south-west of us; it was a low-lying coast,
forming part of the mainland of New Guinea. From here we set our
course due west; during the night we had a fair breeze.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>In the morning we were again close to the mainland coast of New
Guinea. Here the interior was very high like Il do Fermoza; but the
foreland was almost everywhere low or level. We kept sailing to
westward along the coast towards the cape of Good Hope. At noon
Latitude observed 48 minutes, Longitude 150 degrees 31 minutes;
course held west, sailed 24 miles with an east wind. In the
afternoon there was a light breeze; in the evening it fell a calm;
we saw the Cape of Good Hope west and west by south of us at about
6 miles distance. Eastward of the cape of Good Hope the land begins
to be very high until quite close to the shore, without having any
low foreland; the land is somewhat higher than the island of
Fermoza. We continued on our west by north course to the cape of
Hope, the sea now running from the north-east. During the night we
had dark weather with a drizzling rain, the wind being very
variable; afterwards we drifted in a calm.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>At noon we had the cape of Good Hope south of us at 3 miles
distance; Latitude estimated 41 minutes, Longitude 149 degrees 53
minutes; course held west by north, sailed 12 miles. Variation 6
degrees North-East; the wind variable. In the afternoon the wind
was east-north-east with calm weather. We set our course to
westward to the west side of the bay which Willem Schoutens had
sailed into, but had to return from. During the night we drifted in
a calm and made little progress.</p>

<p>Item the 16th.</p>

<p>In the morning we were still drifting in a calm, and saw the
western point of the land at the west side of the bay aforesaid;
this western point lay west of us at about 7 miles distance. At
noon it was calm and we had the western point of the bay
south-south-west of us; we set our course west by north. At noon
Latitude observed 16 minutes, Longitude 149 degrees 9 minutes;
course held west-north-west, sailed 12 miles. Variation 5 degrees
50 minutes; the weather calm; in the afternoon it was calm too, but
since the current was carrying us to westward our progress was
greater as measured by the land we passed than by our advance over
the water. This day we saw several small islands near the western
point; we steered our course towards them west by south. In the
evening at sunset the westernmost point of the mainland we saw bore
from us west slightly southerly, at 3 or 4 miles distance, and a
small islet lying off the said point, west slightly northerly, at 3
or 4 miles distance. Between the mainland and New Guinea and the
island last mentioned we saw the open sea due west of us. We
drifted in a calm; at midnight the land-breeze sprung up and we set
our course west by north in order to run outside the said islet;
during the night we had variable winds alternating with calms.</p>

<p>Item the 17th.</p>

<p>Early in the morning we were close under this island aforesaid
at about one mile distance; we then came upon a shoal and, when
sailing over it, we sounded in the shallowest part 9 fathom, rocky
bottom. When we were past the shoal just mentioned we got deeper
water again; but shortly after, when we had the island south by
east of us, we could see the bottom, the sea being only 7 fathom
deep here, bottom as before; this shoal runs off to north-west from
the land aforesaid. We kept holding our course west by south, and
saw still more islands ahead, west of us 5 or 6 of them. At noon
the island we had passed bore from us east at about 3 miles
distance. During these twenty-four hours we had advanced 9 miles on
a west slightly southerly course. Latitude estimated 20 minutes
south of the equator, Longitude 148 degrees 34 minutes; course held
west one third of a point southerly, sailed 9 miles. In the evening
at sunset there lay west-north-west and north-west by west of us 7
or 8 small islands in a row, bearing from each other west by north
and east by south. We then passed a number of rocks all overgrown
with brushwood; these we left on our starboard, and four more small
islands to larboard, the latter lying near the mainland coast. The
coast of New Guinea here is full of small bays and projecting
points; but there is almost everywhere deep water so that we run on
a mile only from shore; about 4 glasses in the first watch, off a
pretty large bay, we were about 2/3 mile from shore. We took
soundings here in forty fathom, sandy bottom, where we forthwith
anchored. Here we had a large island west by south of us at about 6
miles distance where in the evening we had seen a passage through
between the mainland coast and the said island.</p>

<p>Item the 18th.</p>

<p>Early in the morning with the landwind we weighed anchor and set
sail for the narrows between the mainland coast and the islands in
order to pass through. Shortly afterward we drifted in a calm;
about noon a light breeze from the west and the current were
against us, so that we were carried back, and at length came to
anchor in 16 fathom between an island and a rock which lay level
with the water, the bottom being small coral. At noon Latitude
estimated 26 minutes, Longitude (not recorded) sailed 6 miles. As
we lay here the current began to run much stronger in the
afternoon; we are here in 26 minutes South Latitude; variation 5
1/2 degrees North-East. About four o'clock in the afternoon the
current began to change, the ebb-tide running here to west and the
flood to east, so that a west-south-west moon makes high-water
here; but since we cannot be far from the western extremity of New
Guinea, as the coast begins to trend southward here, it is quite
possible that the two tides meet here at the extremity of New
Guinea, since before we had the flood from the east everywhere
along the coast of New Guinea. As there was no moon we remained at
anchor during the night for safety. This afternoon several prows
came close to our ship; the men in them said they were Ternatans
and spoke the language of Ternate, spoke with them a long time, and
with kind words tried to get them on board of us, but they
pretended to be timid and afraid; from which we concluded that
these men must have been Tydorese. They returned to the shore with
their prows, the wind being west with good weather. During the
night we had a violent current to westward and frequent whirling
currents so that, our anchor quitting its hold, we had to pay out
more cable. For the rest it was calm all through the night.</p>

<p>Item the 19th.</p>

<p>In the morning the current again began to westward; we weighed
anchor and went under sail, the wind being south by west with good
weather; we set our course south-east by east over to landward,
with good dry weather. In the passage we generally sounded from 25
to 45 and 50 fathom. At this point there was a good deal of
&nbsp;roken land as may be seen in our chart of the same. At noon
Latitude observed 35 minutes, Longitude (not recorded); course held
west-south-west, sailed 7 miles, the wind being south by west and
variable; we tacked about to landward since the wind became south
with occasional calms. In the forenoon, the current setting from
the south-south-west, we anchored in 35 fathom, good sandy bottom.
In the afternoon it fell a dead calm. During the night we had
variable currents.</p>

<p>Item the 20th.</p>

<p>In the morning the current ran slightly to south-west and was
variable, the wind blowing from the south-east with a light breeze.
We did our best to tack to the south and pass through between the
islands. But a contrary wind and calms prevented us from making any
considerable progress. We sailed here over a shoal where we sounded
5 fathom, sandy bottom mixed with shingle, but soon afterwards 25,
30, and 40 fathom, same bottom. In the forenoon the wind blew from
the south so that we went over to eastward; shortly after noon, the
wind being south-south-west, we again came upon the shoal aforesaid
and, as the current was setting strong to the north-east, we cast
anchor in 5 fathom. At this point here the current runs very
strangely, so that in my opinion no certain information can be
given concerning it. Who comes here immediately see it, and must
shape his course accordingly. This point aforesaid of New Guinea
mainly consists of broken land which would take more time in
mapping out than we think necessary to bestow on it. We are
satisfied with having discovered a good passage through, which in
future may be of great use to the Company's ships coming from Peru
or Chili at the time of the eastern monsoon. During the night the
wind was southerly with a strong current setting to the south-west
and we remained at anchor.</p>

<p>Item the 21st.</p>

<p>In the morning before daybreak, with the current setting to the
south-west and the wind blowing from the south-east, we weighed
anchor and went under sail with a steady gale and our course set to
the south-west. In the forenoon the wind went about to south by
east so that we made no progress by tacking. About noon we
therefore cast anchor under a small island in 25 fathom, pretty
good bottom, in Latitude 38 minutes South, Longitude (not recorded)
course held south, sailed one mile with a south by east wind; it
being our intention, with the first favourable wind and current
that should offer on the coast of New Guinea or near it, to steer
our course for the south until we shall have passed the latitude of
Cape Wedda in the island of Gilolo, from where we can cross as far
north as possible. We sailed close to shore here in order to get
some firewood, of which there was great plenty here. When arrived
on the said island we certainly observed signs of men but did not
see any natives. It would seem that the only persons landing on
this island are fishermen who dry their fish here at certain
seasons of the year and then carry the same to other places to be
sold there. Near this islet and round the whole point along and
between the islands there are everywhere currents as strong (as the
old saw has it) as the tide before Flushing pier-head. In these
parts the flood runs northward and the ebb southward, but almost
everywhere here the tides follow the direction of the coast, of the
islands and passages, narrows and straits. In the evening at the
end of the first watch, the wind being south-south-east, we set
sail, endeavouring by tacking to run to the south with a steady
breeze.</p>

<p>Item the 22nd.</p>

<p>In the morning, the wind continuing southerly, we kept
endeavouring to run to the south as before, but about noon were
again forced to come to anchor in 35 fathom, sandy bottom, near a
small island about 2 miles south-east by east of the island where
we had previously been at anchor, so that in these twenty-four
hours we advanced no more than 2 miles south-east by east. At noon
Latitude observed 40 minutes, Longitude (not recorded) course held
south-east by east, sailed 12 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 23rd.</p>

<p>In the morning, the wind being south-east but inclining to a
calm, we set sail and endeavoured to run to the south. In the
forenoon the wind was variable so that at noon we had progressed
about 4 miles to the south by east. At noon Latitude estimated 55
minutes, Longitude (not recorded) course held south by east, sailed
4 miles, with variable winds. Variation 4 degrees 30 minutes. Here
we again came close under a number of islands but at first found no
anchorage. The coast of New Guinea in these parts is continually
running in and out, with so many windings and so many large and
small islands that there is no counting them. During the greater
part of the night we drifted in a calm; in the evening we had had
soundings in 50 fathom.</p>

<p>Item the 24th.</p>

<p>In the morning we drifted in a calm as before; in the forenoon,
the wind blowing from the south by east, we did our best by tacking
to run to the south, but we made little progress. At noon Latitude
observed 1 degree 6 minutes, Longitude (not recorded) course held
south-west by west, sailed 3 miles, the wind being south inclining
to a calm. We convened the council with the second mates of the
ships Heemskerk and Zeehaan, in which meeting it was resolved and
determined that we should shape our course above the point of Wedde
and towards Ceram, and further navigate to Batavia, seeing that at
this season of the year there is no other course possible owing to
contrary winds and counter-currents; all which is in extenso set
forth in the resolution this day drawn up touching this matter. In
the course of the night we came close to a small islet which we
could not weather, so that we were obliged to anchor there for some
time in 11 fathom, coarse sandy bottom; as we were lying at anchor
we found that the current was setting pretty strong to
westward.</p>

<p>Item the 25th.</p>

<p>In the morning, the wind being east-south-east, we weighed
anchor and set sail; we passed through between the two islets. This
day we had many variable winds alternating with calms and rains; we
kept doing our best to run to the south. At noon Latitude observed
1 degree 15 minutes, Longitude (not recorded) course held
south-west by west, sailed 4 miles with variable winds. During the
night we set our course due south by west and passed a large island
to larboard of us.</p>

<p>Item the 26th.</p>

<p>At noon we took no latitude. Latitude estimated 1 degree 38
minutes, Longitude (not recorded) course held south by west, sailed
11 miles with variable winds. South-east of us we again saw a large
island about 8 miles in length. It extended mainly east-north-east
and west-south-west with many small islands lying off it on the
north-west side. We then set our course south-south-west to run to
westward of all these small islands. In the evening before sunset
we still saw 2 high islets north-west by west of us at about 7 or 8
miles distance, for which we set our course. We then saw
south-south-west of us the whole extent of the coast of Ceram; we
steered straight for it in good calm weather, the wind then being
north-west. During the first and second quarter of the night we
drifted in a calm; in the day-watch we got the wind from the north
with rain.</p>

<p>Item the 27th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind was chiefly west; the point of the large
island which we had passed the previous evening now bore from us
north-east by north at about 5 miles distance; the wind being
westerly with good calm weather we turned our course over to
southward close by the wind towards the coast of Ceram, from which
at noon we were still 5 miles distant, to wit from the centre of
Ceram. At noon Latitude observed 2 degrees 40 minutes, Longitude
(not recorded) course held south-south-west, sailed 11 miles with
variable winds alternating with calms. At sunset we were still 2 or
2 1/2 miles off the land; the wind continuing westerly, we
endeavoured to run westward, northward of Ceram. During the night
we advanced about 5 or 6 miles with variable winds; in the
day-watch it was mostly calm.</p>

<p>Item the 28th.</p>

<p>In the morning variable winds with rain, thunder and lightning.
Since the landwind was partly blowing from the south we tacked
about to westward. We were now right off the small islands which
lie, 6 together, close to the coast of Ceram, and had the middle of
the said coast south-south-west of us at about 3 miles distance. At
noon the westernmost of the said small islands were
south-south-east of us at about 3 or 2 1/2 miles distance. Today in
the forenoon we had had rain. At noon Latitude estimated 2 degrees
48 minutes South, middle longitude 146 degrees 15 minutes; course
held west by south, sailed 10 miles; in the afternoon we had dry
weather, the wind being south-south-east with a light variable
breeze.</p>

<p>Item the 29th.</p>

<p>At noon we had the island of Boona west-south-west of us at
about 5 miles distance; we set our course close along the coast
with the intention of running southward through the straits of
Nassouw; at noon Latitude estimated 2 degrees 52 minutes South,
Longitude 145 degrees 15 minutes; course held west a quarter of a
point southerly, sailed 15 miles with the wind southerly but
variable. In the afternoon it was calm, and then the wind went
round to westward of the south with a fair breeze, so that in the
night we were forced to run northward of Boona; during the night
the wind blew from the south; we set our course for the island of
Boure as close to the wind as possible.</p>

<p>Item the 30th.</p>

<p>In the morning we were close under the mainland coast of Boure,
along the north side of which we sailed with good weather and a
fair breeze from the south. At noon we had the north-western point
of Boure, known by the name of Tannewary, south by east of us at 1
1/2 miles distance. At noon Latitude estimated 3 degrees 8 minutes
South, Longitude 143 degrees 52 minutes; course held west by south,
sailed 21 miles; in the afternoon we drifted in a calm under wind
going round to westward; we tacked about to the south in order to
be near the land in the evening as we expected the landwind; during
the night we got a light land-breeze; course held west by south
along the land.</p>

<p>Item the 31st.</p>

<p>In the forenoon we had variable winds alternating with calms. At
noon we had the western point of Boure, known by the name of
Tamahoo, south of us about 3 miles distance. About one o'clock in
the afternoon, the wind becoming south with a steady breeze, we set
our course over to westward. At noon Latitude estimated 3 degrees
15 minutes, Longitude 147 degrees 17 minutes; course held west by
south. Towards evening the wind went round to the south-east; we
shaped our course to south-west with a steady breeze and good dry
weather. During the night, at the end of the first watch, the wind
became east-south-east and we set our course south-west by west for
the entrance of the strait of Botton, because we intended to pursue
our course through the said strait and then to the
Booqueroenis.</p>

<p>Item the 1st of June.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind kept blowing from the east-south-east
with good dry weather and a fair breeze; we set our course
west-south-west for the northern point of the island of Botton. At
noon Latitude observed 4 degrees 13 minutes, Longitude 141 degrees
5 minutes; course held south-west by west, sailed 26 miles with an
east-south-east wind. In the afternoon we sighted the strait of
Botton. We sailed in the strait in the evening and during the night
with variable winds alternating with calms, and endeavoured to
continue our voyage through the strait to the south.</p>

<p>Item the 2nd.</p>

<p>In the morning at sunrise we had advanced into the strait a
distance of about 3 miles. In the afternoon we drifted in a calm,
the current being against us. We cast anchor close to the coast of
Boutton in 26 fathom, stiff ground; here we found two junks at
anchor, of which the Supercargo forthwith came on board of us and
showed us their passports which they had obtained from the
Honourable Governor Gerrit Demmer, with which passports they were
going to Byma to return afterwards to Amboyna or to Batavia. The
names of the Anachgoddes of the junks were Mouna and Jurregan
Wanga, besides there was still a free black, Hendrick Jansz of
Solor, ensign of the Green Beggars. From them we learned that the
Honourable Anthony Caen had arrived at Amboyna with a number of
vessels with destination for Ternate. They also told us that the
ship Hollandia was reported to have been lost on her way from
Batavia to Amboyna, but whether this is true we shall learn in
time. At noon Latitude estimated 4 degrees 32 minutes, Longitude
141 degrees 3 minutes; course held west-south-west, sailed 13 miles
with variable winds. During the night when 4 glasses in the first
watch had run out and the current began to set southwards we set
sail; all through the night the wind was very variable but chiefly
south; we did what we could by tacking.</p>

<p>Item the 3rd.</p>

<p>We kept tacking as before, the wind being southerly. At noon we
were full in the first narrows, with the wind northerly but with
frequent calms. At noon Latitude estimated 4 degrees 54 minutes
South, Longitude 140 degrees 59 minutes; course kept south by west,
sailed 6 miles. In the afternoon we had heavy rains; shortly before
the evening we anchored in a calm one mile past the first narrows
in 30 fathom, good stiff ground, the current setting to northward.
About midnight with still water we weighed anchor and set sail but
there was hardly any breeze, so that we made little progress.</p>

<p>Item the 4th.</p>

<p>In the morning we still drifted in a calm. At noon Latitude
estimated 5 degrees 10 minutes South, Longitude 140 degrees 56
minutes; course kept south by west, sailed 4 miles with variable
winds. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon we got the wind from the
south-east and set our course south-south-west straight for the
narrows lying close to Boutton; this is the narrowest part of the
strait of Boutton, where we cast anchor after midnight close to the
island in 12 fathom, stiff ground.</p>

<p>Item the 5th.</p>

<p>Early in the morning we weighed anchor in a calm but, as the
ebb-tide had nearly run out, two hours before noon we anchored in
the middle of the narrows with our kedge-anchor in 45 fathom, hard
bottom. At noon Latitude estimated 5 degrees 5 minutes South,
Longitude 140 degrees 52 minutes; course kept south by west, sailed
3 1/2 miles with variable winds and rain. In the afternoon at early
ebbtide and in a calm, being engaged in weighing our kedge-anchor,
we found that it had got under a rock and were forced to let it go,
continuing our voyage to Boutton, so as in the evening to get clear
of the straits south of Boutton, with a south wind alternating with
calms. In the evening after the setting of the first watch the
steward's mate Jan Pietersz of Meldrop, whom we had put on board
the flute-ship until such time as we should arrive at Batavia, on
account of certain charges that had been brought against him, and
of misdemeanours of which he was suspected, let himself overboard
into the sea by means of rope and swam to shore at Botton. During
the night the wind was northerly with a light breeze; course held
west-south-west.</p>

<p>Item the 6th.</p>

<p>In the morning the middle of the island of Camboona was
north-west of us at about 2 1/2 miles distance; the wind being
easterly and our course held west by south. At noon we had the
western point of Camboona north by west of us at 3 miles distance.
At noon Latitude estimated 5 degrees 43 minutes, Longitude 140
degrees 11 minutes; course held west-south-west, sailed 11 miles.
In the afternoon we had a steady breeze from the east by south.
During the night at the end of the second watch we passed the islet
known as the Booquernoenis in good, clear, dry weather.</p>

<p>Item the 7th.</p>

<p>At noon we had the western point of the high land of Turatte
north-north-east of us at about 3 miles distance; course held
west-north-west along the coast in dry weather and with a steady
east wind. At noon Latitude estimated 6 degrees South, Longitude
138 degrees 1 minute; course held west half a point southerly, the
wind being east with a steady breeze. In the evening at sunset we
set our course west by south, straight for the great shoal which we
passed over at midnight in 13 fathom, rocky bottom.</p>

<p>Item the 8th.</p>

<p>In the morning we had a steady south-east wind. About 3 hours
before noon we passed over a large rocky reef, sounding 6 fathom in
the shallowest part. We quite distinctly saw the bottom which was
strewn with large stones. At noon Latitude observed 6 degrees 2
minutes, Longitude 135 degrees 21 minutes; course held west, sailed
40 miles with a south-east wind; afterwards we set our course west
by south in good weather.</p>

<p>Item the 9th.</p>

<p>South-east monsoon with good, dry weather. At noon the island of
Maduere was by estimation at 8 miles distance, south-south-west of
us. At noon Latitude observed 6 degrees 15 minutes; course held
west by south, sailed 26 miles; Longitude 133 degrees 49
minutes.</p>

<p>Item the 10th.</p>

<p>Good dry weather; we took soundings in 35 fathom. At noon
Latitude observed 6 degrees 26 minutes, Longitude 132 degrees 29
minutes; course held west by south, sailed 20 miles; in the evening
we had the western extremity of the island of Lubock north by west
of us at 4 miles distance.</p>

<p>Item the 11th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind kept blowing from the south-east; we saw
the line of the coast of Java, near Lubuan; at noon it fell a calm;
Latitude estimated 6 degrees 26 minutes, Longitude 131 degrees 23
minutes; course held west, sailed 16 1/2 miles. We had here both
sea and landwind; a light mild breeze; in the afternoon the wind
became south with a fair breeze. We set our course west; in the
evening the mountain of Lubuan was due south of us; then we also
saw the high mountain of Japare, and the islet of Mandelycke, which
bore from us due west by south, at about 6 miles distance.</p>

<p>Item the 12th.</p>

<p>In the morning we drifted in a calm; towards noon the sea-wind
sprang up from the north-east; course held west by south. At noon
we had the islet of Mandelycke east by south of us at 4 miles
distance, and the central land of Crymon Java north-north-west of
us at 6 miles distance. At noon Latitude observed 6 degrees 27
minutes, Longitude 130 degrees 33 minutes; course held west by
south half a point westerly, sailed 12 miles with land and
sea-wind. In the afternoon, the wind becoming north-east with a
fair breeze, we set our course west by north. In the evening at
sunset the island of Crymon Java lay north-east by north
north-north-east of us; we continued sailing on a west by north
course as before.</p>

<p>Item the 13th.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind was south-east; at noon we had the
mountain of Cerebon south-east by south of us, and the Boomtjes
island west of us at 10 miles distance by estimation; course held
as before in calm weather. At noon Latitude observed 6 degrees,
Longitude 129 degrees 3 minutes; course held west by north, sailed
23 miles with land and sea-wind. We then shaped our course west by
south in order to make Poulo Rakit and the coast of Java; in the
evening at sunset we had Poulo Rakit west by north of us at about 5
miles distance, the wind being east-south-east with calm weather,
the mountain of Cerabon bearing from us south by west. During the
night we kept sailing along the coast with the landwind in 20 or 21
fathom, stiff ground.</p>

<p>Item the 14th.</p>

<p>In the morning we passed the point with the grove of trees; we
had the landwind with a fair breeze and thus sailed along the land
in depths of from 18 to 15 fathom, until we got near the shallows
of the Schadelycken Hoek. At noon Latitude estimated 6 degrees 3
minutes South, Longitude 127 degrees 59 minutes; course held west,
sailed 21 miles. At noon we came upon the shallows of the
Schadelycken Hoek which we rounded sounding in 7 or 8 fathom. At
the end of the shoal we saw an English ship lying with flags from
her main and mizzen-tops; on our approach she weighed anchor and
sailed eastward, but for what port we do not know. In the evening
at sunset we had the point of Carauan south-west of us at about 4
miles distance. We set our course along the coast, having the wind
still along shore; during the night we passed through between the
islands of Leyden and Enckhuyzen; when we had advanced a quarter of
a mile between these islands we dropped anchor in 11 fathom, stiff
ground; Latitude estimated 6 degrees 12 minutes, Longitude 127
degrees 18 minutes; course held west by north and west-north-west,
sailed 11 miles.</p>

<p>Item the 15th.</p>

<p>In the morning at daybreak I went to Batavia in the pinnace. God
be praised and thanked for this happy voyage.</p>

<h4 id="instr">INSTRUCTIONS TO TASMAN FOR HIS VOYAGE OF 1644.</h4>

<p>EXTRACT FROM THE BOOK OF DESPATCHES FROM BATAVIA; COMMENCING
JANUARY THE 15TH, 1644, AND ENDING NOVEMBER THE 29TH FOLLOWING.</p>

<p>Instructions for the commodore, Captain Abel Jansz Tasman, the
skipper chief-pilot, Franz Jacobsz Visser, and the counsel of the
yachts Limmen and Zeemeuw, and the tender de Brak, destined for a
nearer discovery of New Guinea and the unknown coasts of the
discovered east and south lands, together with the channels and the
islands supposed to be situated between and near them.</p>

<p>The several successive administrations of India, in order to
enlarge and extend the trade of the Dutch East India company, have
zealously endeavoured to make an early discovery of the great land
of New Guinea and other unknown east and southerly countries, as
you know by several discourses, and maps, journals, and papers
communicated to you. But hitherto with little success, although
several voyages have been undertaken.</p>

<p>1st. By order of the president, John Williamson Verschoor, who
at that time directed the company's trade at Bantam, which was in
the year 1606, with the yacht the Duyfken, who in their passage
sailed by the islands Key and Aroum, and discovered the south and
west coast of New Guinea for about 220 miles (880) from 5 to 13 3/4
degrees south latitude: and found this extensive country, for the
greater part desert, but in some places inhabited by wild, cruel
black savages, by whom some of the crew were murdered; for which
reason they could not learn anything of the land or waters, as had
been desired of them, and by want of provisions and other
necessaries they were obliged to leave the discovery unfinished:
the furthest point of the land was called in their map Cape
Keer-Weer, situated in 13 3/4 degrees South.</p>

<p>The second voyage was undertaken with a yacht in the year 1617
by order of the Fiscal D'Edel, with little success, of which
adventures and discoveries, through the loss of their journals and
remarks, nothing certain is to be found.</p>

<p>From this time the further discoveries of the unknown east and
south countries were postponed until the year 1623 on account of
there being no ships to spare; but in the interim, in the year
1619, a ship named the Arms of Amsterdam, destined to Banda, drove
past that place and touched at the south coast of New Guinea, where
some of the crew were murdered by the savage inhabitants, wherefore
they acquired no certain knowledge of the country.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, in the years 1616, 1618, 1619 and 1622, the
west coast of this great unknown south land from 35 to 22 degrees
South Latitude was discovered by outward-bound ships, and among
them by the ship Eendraght; for the nearer discovery of which the
governor-general, Jan Pietersz Coen (of worthy memory) in
September, 1622, despatched the yachts De Haring and Harewind; but
this voyage was rendered abortive by meeting the ship Mauritius,
and searching after the ship Rotterdam.</p>

<p>In consequence of which, by order of His excellency, the third
voyage was undertaken in the month of January 1623, with the yachts
Pera and Arnhem out of Amboina, under the command of Jan Carstens;
with order to make a nearer friendship with the inhabitants of the
islands Key, Aroum, and Tenimber, and better to discover New Guinea
and the south lands, when an alliance was made with the said
islands and south coast of New Guinea nearer discovered. The
skipper, with eight of the crew of the yacht Arnhem, was
treacherously murdered by the inhabitants; and after a discovery of
the great islands Arnhem and the Spult (by an untimely Separation)
this yacht, with very little success, came back to Amboina.
&nbsp;But the yacht Pera, persisting in the voyage, sailed along
the south coast of New Guinea to a flat cove on this coast,
situated in 10 degrees south latitude, and ran along the west coast
of this land to Cape Keer-Weer, from thence discovered the coast
farther southward as far as 17 degrees South to Staten River (from
this place what more of the land could be discerned seemed to
stretch westward) and from thence returned to Amboina.</p>

<p>In this discovery were found everywhere shallow water and barren
coast; islands altogether thinly peopled by divers cruel, poor, and
brutal nations, and of very little use to the Company. Countries
may be seen on the maps which were made of them.</p>

<p>Through the little success of this third voyage, but mostly
because no ships could be spared, the discovery was again omitted
until 1636, but in the interim, in the year 1627, the south coast
of the great south land was accidentally discovered by the ship
Gulde Zeepard, outward bound from Fatherland, for the space of 250
miles (1000) and again accidentally in the year following, 1628, on
the north side in the latitude of 21 degrees South, by the ship
Vianen, homeward bound from India when they coasted about 50 miles
(200) without gaining any particular knowledge of this great
country, only observing a foul and barren shore, green fields and
very wild, black, barbarous inhabitants; all which, by the loss of
the ship Batavia and the cruelties and miseries which followed from
that, if fully proved, and was experienced by the crew of the yacht
Sardam, in their course along this coast.</p>

<p>At last the fourth voyage was undertaken (in our government) in
the month of April 1636 from Banda with the yachts Clyn, Amsterdam
and Wesel, under the command of Gerrit Tomasz Pool for the
discovery of the east and south lands; when they first discovered
the coast of New Guinea in 3 1/2 degrees south latitude, and
coasted about sixty miles (240) to the eastward to 5 degrees South,
when the commodore Pool, with three of the crew (by the barbarous
inhabitants) was murdered at the same place where the skipper of
that yacht Arnhem was killed in the year 1623.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding which the voyage was assiduously continued under
the supercargo Pieter Pietersz and, the islands Key and Arnoum
visited by very strong easterly winds, they could not reach the
west coast to New Guinea but, shaping their course very near south,
described the coast of Arnhem or Van Diemen's Land in 11 degrees
south latitude, and sailed along the coast for 30 miles (120)
without seeing any people, but many signs of smoke; when, turning
towards the north, they visited the unknown islands of Timor Laut
and the known islands of Tenimber, Kauwer, etc., but without ever
being able to converse with the inhabitants who were a very timid
people when, after three months cruising, they returned in July to
Banda, without (in this voyage) having done or discovered anything
of consequence; which may be seen by the journals and maps.</p>

<p>After the little success in these voyages nothing further was
attempted on discovery to the eastward, but last year (under your
direction) the discovery of the remaining unknown south lands was
assiduously reattempted; and in that remarkable voyage was that
great unknown Staten and Van Diemen's Land discovered from 35 to 43
degrees south latitude, and at the same time the (so long wished
for) passage to the South Sea, but it is unnecessary to relate more
here as you are perfectly acquainted with all particulars.</p>

<p>But to obtain a thorough knowledge of these extensive countries,
the discovery whereof has been begun (in consequence of the
intention of the Company and the recommendation of our masters) now
only remains for the future to discover whether New Guinea is one
continent with that great south land, or separated by channels and
islands lying between them; and also whether that New Van Diemen's
Land is the same continent with these two great countries or with
one of them or, if separated from them, what islands may be
dispersed between New Guinea and the unknown south land when, after
more experience and knowledge of all the said known and unknown
countries, we shall be better enabled for further undertakings.</p>

<p>After considering all that is above related and, by our estimate
of the present strength of the Company's naval forces, it is found
that, without prejudice to the ordinary trading and warlike
expeditions, two or three yachts could be spared, it is therefore
resolved in the Council of India to equip the yachts Limmen, the
Zeemeuw, and the Brak for the further discovery of the east and
south lands to furnish them well with all necessaries, and commit
them to your conduct, in confidence that you will with courage,
vigilance, prudence, good order, and the requisite perseverance,
skilfully direct this important voyage in such a manner as to be
capable to give an account on your return fully to our
contentment.</p>

<p>1st. You shall early tomorrow morning, after mustering your men,
proceed to sea in company and steer a course to Macassar, Amboina,
and Banda, as the service of the Company shall require, and by
separate instructions you are commanded, by which you are entirely
to regulate your voyage to the above places.</p>

<p>On your arrival at Amboina and Banda you shall plentifully stock
your yachts with water, fuel, and all other necessaries; in the
time you are there the crews are to be supplied with all sorts of
fresh provisions, and well provided for the voyage, for which
purpose this shall be an order to the vice-governors Gerrit Demmer
and Cornelis Witzen, to whom you have to communicate your
instructions and demand in writing the further knowledge they may
have of the countries situated to the east of Banda; and
particularly the journal of the commodore Carstens, which we think
may still be found there, and be of some service to you on the
voyage.</p>

<p>But by this we by no means intend you shall spend time
unprofitably, but despatch everything so assiduously that you may
leave Banda in the latter end of February, when the west monsoon
had set in, fixing, with the advice of the council, instructions
for the signals at the beginning of your voyage, in which
particularly is to be inserted by what method the yachts may join,
in case (which God prevent) they by storm or other accidents were
separated, upon which the good success of the intended voyage
chiefly depends.</p>

<p>After fulfilling your orders at Amboina and Banda you shall (as
is mentioned) in the latter end of February (or sooner if possible)
undertake in the name of God the voyage you are ordered upon, and
steer your course eastward between and in view of the islands
Tenimber, Key, and Aroum, to the point True or False Cape situated
in 8 degrees on the south of New Guinea; from which place you are
to continue eastward along the coast till 9 degrees south latitude,
crossing prudently the cove at that place looking about the high
island or Spelut's River with the yachts for a harbour, and to
inspect into the state of the country; dispatching the tender Brak
for two or three days into the cove in order to discover whether
within the great inlet there is not to be found an entrance into
the South Sea which soon may be determined by the current of the
streams. From this place you are to coast along the west coast of
New Guinea to the farthest discoveries in 170 degrees South
latitude, following this coast farther as it may run west of
southward.</p>

<p>But it is to be feared you will meet in these parts with
South-East trade-winds, by which it will be difficult to keep the
coast on board, if stretching to the South-East, but
notwithstanding this endeavour by all means to proceed, by reason
that we may be sure whether this land is divided from the great
known south continent or not, which by the great and slow swell
from the South-East may well be perceived; in which case you shall
try (if possible) to run so far to the South-East as the New Van
Diemen's Land, and from thence to the islands of St. Peter and St.
Francois, to learn the situation of these to the northward, and at
the same time to be assured (which is much wished for) a passage to
the South Sea between them and the known south land, which found
(as we presume and hope) you ought, returning through the
discovered passage, to steer along the east coast of the known
south land according to its trending, following its direction to
the westward to De Wit's Land and William's River in 22 degrees
south latitude, when the known south land would be entirely
circumnavigated and discovered to be the largest island of the
globe.</p>

<p>But if (as we presume) the land of New Guinea is joined to the
south land and in consequence is one continent, you will be enabled
by the South-East trade-wind to run along the north coast from 17
to 22 degrees South, and this entirely to discover this land from
whence (if wind and weather by any means will permit) you shall
steer along the land of De Eendragt to Houtman's Abrolhos, and come
to an anchor at a fit place thereabout; and endeavour to find a
chest containing eight thousand rix dollars that remained in the
wreck of the ship Batavia, a brass half cartow having fallen on
that chest when it foundered at that place in the year 1629, and
which the crew of the yacht Sardam dragged for in vain. At the same
time you shall (if possible) recover that piece, by this you will
render service to the Company, for which reason be not negligent in
the discharge of your duty.</p>

<p>Likewise inquire at the continent thereabout after two Dutchmen
who, having forfeited their lives, were put on shore by the
commodore Francois Pelsart, if still alive, in which case you may
make your inquiries of them about the situation of these countries,
and if they entreat you to that purpose give them passage hither;
on this occasion you ought to search for a good water and
refreshing place about the 26 or 28 degrees South latitude, which
would be a desirable thing for the outwardbound ships.</p>

<p>But if the late time of the year and the appearance of storms
will not permit you to reach Houtman's Shoal which, after
experience, we leave to yours and the council's own judgment,
consider how you have to sail again from William's River to the
east, along the coast of the south land and from De Wit's Land, by
the help of the South-East trade-wind, to run across very near
eastward to complete the discovery of Arnhem's and Van Diemen's
Lands; and to ascertain perfectly whether these lands are not one
and the same island, and what these places produce; likewise what
other islands besides Baly, Sumbava, and Timor may be situated
about the south land.</p>

<p>After all this (by the help of God) shall be fortunately
transacted, which we hope can be done before the end of the month
of June (having either reached Houtman's Abrolhos or Van Diemen's
Land) you have to steer your course to the south coast of Java, and
along the coast through the Strait of Sunda to return to Batavia:
at which place we shall expect you in July following attended with
good success.</p>

<p>Of all the lands, countries, islands, capes, points or coves,
inlets, bays, rivers, shoals, reefs, sands, cliffs, rocks, etc.,
which you meet with and pass in this discovery, as well upon the
coast of New Guinea and the south land, as in the Indian Ocean and
inland seas, you are to make accurate maps and circumstantial
descriptions and to draw perfectly the views and from, for which
purpose a draughtsman is to go along with you.</p>

<p>Be particularly careful about longitude and latitude, in what
direction and at what distances all coasts, islands, capes, points,
bays and rivers are situated from one and the other, and what are
the marks by which they may be known, as mountains, hills, trees,
or buildings to be seen thereupon.</p>

<p>Take a thorough survey of the depth of the water near the shore
and of the sunken rocks, the rapid current of the rivers at the
points, how and by what marks they are to be avoided, and if the
bottom is hard, soft, sharp, flat, sloping, or steep, and if they
may be approached or not, by the soundings; upon what marks the
best anchoring places in harbours and bays are to be found, how the
inlets and rivers are to be entered, what winds usually blow in the
different parts; the course of the streams, whether ebb and flood
are regulated by the moon or wind; what alterations of monsoon,
rains or dry weather you experience; and observed farther
diligently to remark and note down (which is the duty of all able
pilots) whatever may be of service in future voyages to the
discovered countries.</p>

<p>The time of the year will doubtless not permit, by the
shortening of the days, to lose any time, but carefully and
diligently to proceed; for the above reason it is consequence to
discover as much and in as short a time as possible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless to discover in a proper manner the coasts of the
east, and south land, it will be necessary in good time now and
then to anchor in proper places, always looking for and choosing
such bays and harbours as with the least danger may be entered and
left, where you may lie in safety, and which by accidental winds or
for other reasons you may soon quit.</p>

<p>But be particularly careful, circumspect and prudent in landing
with small craft, because (as above-mentioned) at several times New
Guinea has been found to be inhabited by cruel wild savages and, as
it is uncertain what sort of people the inhabitants of the south
lands are, it may ratherbe presumed that they are also wild and
barbarous savages than a civilised people, for which reason you
ought always to be upon your guard and well armed; because in all
countries of the globe experience has taught us no savages are to
be trusted, by reason they always suppose people who appear so
unexpectedly and strangely to them are only come to invade their
country; all which is proved in the discovery of America and the
Indies, by the surprise and murdering many careless and unwary
discoverers, many times to the ruin of their voyages.</p>

<p>When you meet and converse with any of these savages behave well
and friendly to them; do not take notice of little affronts or
thefts which they practice upon you, because resentment might
create disgust; but try by all means to engage their affection to
you, the better to learn from them the state of their country,
particularly if any thing for the service of the company may be
done there.</p>

<p>You are also to inquire as much as time will permit into the
productions of their country, the fruits and animals, the
buildings, the shape and faces of the people, their clothing, arms,
morals, manners, food, trade, religion, government, war, and
everything worthy of remark; particularly whether they are
peaceable or malicious.</p>

<p>You are to show the samples of the goods which you carry along
with you, to inquire what materials and goods they possess, and
what is wanted of ours; all which you are closely to observe, well
to annotate, and correctly to describe; for which reason you are to
keep a very circumstantial journal wherein all particulars may be
perfectly inserted, by which upon your return you may give a
satisfactory report to us.</p>

<p>If any country be discovered peopled by a civilised nation (as
apparently will not be the case) you may depend more upon them than
upon the wild savages; try to converse with their governors and
subjects, and to establish an acquaintance; inform them you come
there to trade, show them the goods in proper order; for this
purpose laden on board both the yachts and the tender, amounting to
the sum of 2809 guilders, 17 stivers, and three penningen, of all
which the junior merchants have to keep books in proper order, by
which they (when called upon) may be enabled to give a satisfactory
account.</p>

<p>Showing the samples and goods, you and the junior merchants are
carefully to remark what good the strange nations most esteem and
to which they are most inclined; likewise inquire what merchants
and goods they possess, particularly after gold and silver, and
whether these metals are held in great esteem; to keep them
ignorant of the precious value seem not greedily after it; if they
offer to barter for your goods seem not to convert these minerals,
but show them copper, tutenag (zinc) pewter and lead, as if these
were of more value to us. If you find them inclined to trade keep
the goods which they seem most greedy after at so high a value that
none may be sold nor bartered without great profit, likewise take
nothing but what you are convinced will turn out profitable to the
Company, which in trading you will learn. It will be particularly
necessary to bring samples of the most rare things to be found
there, and of all the rest exact account, to see what return from
thence can be made, and for the future may be serviceable.</p>

<p>You are prudently to prevent all insolences and maltreatment of
the ship's crew against the discovered nations, and to take care by
no means to insult them in their houses, gardens, ships,
possessions, nor women, etc. Likewise not to carry away any
inhabitant against their will, but if a few voluntarily should be
inclined to go along with you then you are permitted to bring them
to this place.</p>

<p>We have here expressed in general our intentions respecting a
voyage you are to undertake but, as upon all that may occur no
precise orders can be given, we leave the rest to your zeal,
vigilance and good conduct, likewise to the council's prudent
dispositions, in a full hope and confidence you will in this
expedition be so vigilant as to succeed to the service of the
Company, when we will not be backward to recompense your endeavours
as you may merit; for if in this voyage are discovered any
countries, islands or passages profitable to the Company we promise
you by this to reward the conductors and well-behaving ships' crew
with such premiums as we shall find their good service to have
merited, upon which you all may depend. Likewise you are to fix a
competent premium to those who first shall perceive an unknown
country, island, shoal, rock, or dangerous foul ground, in order to
avoid as much as possible all misfortunes.</p>

<p>To prevent any other European nation from reaping (perhaps) the
fruits of our labour and expenses in these discoveries you are
everywhere to take possession, in the name and by the orders of the
Dutch East India Company, of the countries and islands you may
arrive at not inhabited by savages; to put up some signs, for
instance, plant trees, sow some fruit trees, erect a stone or post,
and to cut or carve in them the arms of the Netherlands or of the
Company, and in what year and at what time such a land was
discovered and taken in possession, declaring further in intention
by the first opportunity to send people thither from hence, and to
establish a colony to secure the property near to us.</p>

<p>But if it happens (which is not unlikely) that you discover some
countries or islands that may have a polished government you are to
endeavour with its chiefs or governors (in the name as above) to
make contract upon the most advantageous terms you possibly can
obtain, including a resignation (if they are inclined to do such)
or permission to frequent the place exclusive of all other nations;
or other advantages for the Company; all which you must note down
circumstantially in your journals, expressing the names and
qualities of those whom you shall have treated, to serve the
Company when it may be wanted.</p>

<p>In order this dangerous voyage, according to these instructions
and our good intentions, may be well regulated and finished, good
order kept among the crew, right and justice administered
conformable to the general articles; and everything (which upon so
dangerous and long a voyage may happen to be required) be done and
transacted to the greatest service of the Company; we appoint by
this the Honourable Abel Jansz Tasman commodore of the three yachts
and the crew which sail with them; we authorise him to hoist the
pendant on board the yacht Limmen, to assemble the council, and
whereof he is to be constantly president: command in consequence
the officers, soldiers and sailors (nobody excepted) appointed upon
the yachts Limmen, De Zeemeuw, and De Brak, to acknowledge and obey
him as their chief and commander; to support him by good advice and
assiduity, to the forwarding of the voyage and the ordered
discovery of the unknown countries, as is the duty of vigilant and
faithful servants, in such a manner as, upon return, everyone may
be able to answer.</p>

<p>The council of the three yachts shall consist of the following
persons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The commodore: Abel Jansz Tasman Constantly President.</li>

<li>The skipper chief pilot Francois Jacobs, of the Limmen.</li>

<li>The skipper Dirk Cornelisz Haan, of the Zeemeuw.</li>

<li>Supercargo Isaac Gissmans of the Zeemeuw.</li>

<li>The skipper Jasper Jansz Koops of the Brak.</li>

<li>Cryn Henderiskz, First mate of the Limmen.</li>

<li>Carsten Jurjansz, First mate of the Zeemeuw.</li>

<li>Cornelis Robol, First mate of the Brak.</li>

<li>The junior merchant Anthony Blauw, as councillor or
secretary.</li>
</ul>

<p>By this council shall all occurring business towards forwarding
the voyage, fulfilling our orders, and administering of justice, be
concluded upon and transacted: if it so happen there is an equal
number of votes the commodore is to have two votes; but in cases of
navigation and discovery of countries the second mates shall also
assist with advising votes, all which the commodore shall collect,
and determine by the majority of the concluding votes, taking care
to have all resolutions instantly truly registered and strictly
complied with the service of the Company.</p>

<p>In the council of each particular yacht the junior merchant or
bookkeeper and high boatswains shall be called as directed in the
orders of our masters.</p>

<p>If the commodore Tasman (which God forbid) should decease such a
person shall succeed him as in our sealed act is nominated, which
in every respect conformable to this instruction in manner his
predecessor commanded, and (as is right) he shall be obeyed.</p>

<p>The yachts are manned with 111 persons, and amongst them one
officer and 16 soldiers. Namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Limmen: 45 sailors, 11 soldiers; in all 56 persons.</li>

<li>In the Zeemeuw: 35 sailors, 6 soldiers; in all 41 persons.</li>

<li>In the Brak: 14 sailors, 0 soldiers; in all 14 persons.</li>

<li>94 sailors, 17 soldiers: total 111 persons.</li>
</ul>

<p>All well provided with all necessary ammunition, tools, and
utensils, and for eight months plentifully victualled. Manage
everything well and orderly, take notice you see the ordinary
portion of two meat and two pork days, and a quarter of vinegar, a
half quarter of sweet oil per week, and a half quarter of arrack
per day regularly distributed. Each yacht carries a leaguer and 120
quarts of strong arrack (the Brak is provided from the Zeemeuw)
which must be carefully distributed in the cold climate for the
health of the people. Notwithstanding you are plentifully stocked
with waterbuts manage particularly fresh water and fuel to prevent
wanting it; as you would then be obliged to search after it, to the
retarding of your voyage, or return without success, to your shame
and the great detriment of the Company, which has been at great
expense in equipping these yachts; and for these reasons, by
industry and prudence, ought to be prevented from suffering.</p>

<p>We give then no further instruction and leave to your and the
council's good conduct and advice what you will have more to do
upon this voyage; only recommending seriously in all emergencies to
use such prudence as may keep the Company's valuable ships and
people out of all dangers as much as can be done. For the better to
answer this purpose we do not approve the commodore much to leave
shipboard, but to stay in the yacht, unless (with advice of the
council) the Company's service may require the contrary in order to
avoid the object being neglected by any unforeseen misfortune in
this important voyage.</p>

<p>To conclude this instruction we wish you the protection and
blessings of Omnipotence, which we pray to inspire you with manly
courage for the intended discoveries, and after finishing to return
in safety, to the expanding of His glory, reputation to the mother
country, the service of the Company, our contentment, and to your
own everlasting honour.</p>

<p>Out of the castle, Batavia, this 29th day of January, 1644,
signed,</p>

<p>ANTONIO VAN DIEMEN, CORNELIS VAN DER LYN, JOAN MAATSUIKER,
JUSTUS SCHOUTEN, AND SALOMON SWEERS.</p>

<hr class="w30">

<p>South land seal-up Commission for the Successor of the Commodore
Abel Jansz Tasman, in case of his Decease.</p>

<p>In consideration of the uncertainty of life in the human race,
and the disorders which many times arise from the loss of those in
command, and to prevent as much as possible all evil, we have found
good to order, as we do by this: that if the skipper, commodore
Abel Jansz Tasman, upon this voyage of discovery should decease
(which God forbid) the skipper of the yacht the Zeemeuw, Dirk
Cornelisz Haan, shall succeed in his place, shall be acknowledged
and obeyed as chief, and receive and follow this our instruction
given to Tasman as given to himself.</p>

<p>In this case, for the service of the Company, is this our
meaning and desire.</p>

<p>Out of the castle, Batavia, day and date as above.</p>
