<h1>I</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>One of the stewards of the big Atlantic liner pushed his way
among the passengers to a young lady who was leaning alone
against the taffrail. "Mrs. Vance Weston?"</p>

<p>The lady had been lost in the effort to absorb, with drawn-up
unseeing eyes, a final pyramidal vision of the New York she was
leaving--a place already so unreal to her that her short-sighted
gaze was unable to register even vaguely its towering signals of
farewell. She turned back.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vance Weston?"</p>

<p>"No--" she began; then, correcting herself with a
half-embarrassed smile: "Yes."</p>

<p>Stupid--incredibly! But it was the first time the name had
been given to her. And it was not true; she was not yet Mrs.
Vance Weston, but Halo Tarrant, the still undivorced wife of
Lewis Tarrant. She did not know when she would be free, and some
absurd old leaven of Lorburn Puritanism (on her mother's side she
was a Lorburn of Paul's Landing) made her dislike to masquerade
under a name to which she had no right. Yet before her own
conscience and her lover's she was already irrevocably what she
called herself: his wife; supposing one could apply the term
irrevocable to any tie in modern life without provoking Olympian
laughter. She herself would once have been the first to share in
that laughter; but she had to think of her own situation as
binding her irrevocably, or else to assume that life, in its
deepest essence, was as brittle as the glass globe which the
monkeys shatter in the bitter scene of Faust's visit to the
witch. If she were not Vance Weston's for always the future was
already a handful of splinters.</p>

<p>The steward, handing her a telegram, and a letter inscribed
"urgent," had hurried away on his distribution of correspondence.
On the envelope of the letter she read the name of her lawyer;
and as he was not given to superfluous writing, and as telegrams
were too frequent to be of consequence, she opened the letter
first. "Dear Mrs. Tarrant," she read, "I am sending this by hand
to the steamer in the hope of reaching you in time to persuade
you not to sail. I have just heard, from a safe source, that your
husband knows of your plans, and is not disposed to consent to
your divorcing him if you persist in leaving the country in the
circumstances of which you have advised me." (She smiled at this
draping of the facts.) "Indeed, I suspect he may refuse to take
divorce proceedings himself, simply in order to prevent your
re-marrying. I should have tried to see you at once if I were not
leaving for Albany on professional business; but I earnestly beg
you, if my messenger reaches you before you are actually off ..."</p>

<p>Halo Tarrant lifted her eyes from the letter. No; she was not
actually off. The decks were still in the final confusion of
goodbyes; friends and relatives were lingering among the
passengers till the landing gong should hurry them ashore. There
was time to dash down to her cabin, collect her possessions, and
descend the gangplank with the other visitors, leaving a note of
explanation for the companion she was abandoning. For his sake as
well as her own, ought she not to do it? What she knew of her
husband made her ready enough to believe that a headlong impulse
of reprisals might make him sacrifice his fixed purpose, his hope
of happiness, a future deliberately willed and designed by
himself, to the satisfaction of hurting and humiliating her. He
was almost capable of wishing that she <i>would</i> go away with
Vance Weston; the mere pleasure of thwarting her would be keen
enough to repay him. He was a man who grew fat on resentment as
others did on happiness...For an instant her old life rose
before her. This was the man she had lived with for ten years; he
had always been what he was now, and she had always known it. The
thought frightened her even now--she had to admit that he could
still frighten her. But the admission stiffened her will. Did he
really imagine that any threat of his could still affect her?
That she would give up a year, perhaps two years, of happiness,
of life--life at last!--and sit in conventual solitude till the
divorce, conducted with old-fashioned discretion and
deliberation, permitted him to posture before his little world as
the husband who has chivalrously "allowed" an unworthy but
unblamed wife to gain her liberty? How quaint and out-of-date it
all sounded! What did she care if she divorced him or he divorced
her--what, even, if he chose to wreak his malice on her by
preventing any recourse to divorce? Her life had struck root in
the soul-depths, while his uneasily fluttered on the surface; and
that put her beyond all reach of malice. She read the letter
twice over, slowly; then with a smiling deliberation she tore it
up, and sent the fragments over the taffrail.</p>

<p>As she did so, she felt a faint vibration through the immense
bulk to which her fate was committed. It was too late now--really
too late. The gong had sounded; the steamer was moving. For
better or worse, she had chosen; and she was glad she had done so
deliberately.</p>

<p>"We're off!" she heard at her side, in a voice of passionate
excitement. She turned and laid her hand on Vance Weston's; their
eyes met, laughing. "Now at last you'll have your fill of the
sea," she said.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Only a week..."</p>

<p>"Ten days to Gibraltar."</p>

<p>"What's that you've got?"</p>

<p>With a little start she looked down at her hand. "Oh, only a
telegram. The steward brought it. I forgot..."</p>

<p>"Forgot what?"</p>

<p>"Everything that has to do with that dead world." She made a
gesture of dismissal toward the dwindling cliffs of masonry. "The
steward called me Mrs. Vance Weston," she added, smiling.</p>

<p>He responded to her smile. "Well, you'll have to get used to
that."</p>

<p>They both laughed again, for the mere joy of sipping their
laughter out of the one cup; then she said: "I suppose I ought to
open it..."</p>

<p>"Oh, why? Now we're off, why not drop it into the sea as a
tribute to old Liberty over there? We owe her a tribute, don't
we?" he said; and she thought, with a little thrill of feminine
submission: "How strong and decided he seems! He tells me what to
do--he takes everything for granted. I'm the weak inexperienced
one, after all." She ran her finger carelessly under the flap of
the telegram.</p>

<p>Now that they were off, as he said, it did not much matter
whether she opened her telegrams or threw them to the waves. What
possibility was there in her adventure that she had not already
foreseen, agonized over and finally put out of mind as inevitable
or irrelevant? With that last letter she had tossed her past
overboard. Smiling, brooding, still thinking only of himself and
her, enclosed in the impenetrable world of their love, she opened
the telegram under their joint gaze.</p>

<p>They read: "Happiness is a work of art. Handle with care." The
message was unsigned, but no signature was necessary. "Poor old
Frenny!" Her first impulse was to smile at the idea that any one,
and most of all an embittered old bachelor like her friend George
Frenside, should think it possible to advise her as to the nature
or management of happiness. Her eyes met Vance's, and she saw
that they were grave.</p>

<p>"I suppose he remembered something in his own life," Vance
said.</p>

<p>"I suppose so." It made her shiver a little to think that some
day she too might be remembering--<i>this.</i> At the moment,
happiness seemed to have nothing to do with memory, to be an
isolating medium dividing her from the past as completely, as
arbitrarily, as this huge ship had detached her little world of
passengers from the shores of earth. Suddenly Halo recalled
having said to Frenside, in the course of one of their endless
speculative talks: "Being contented is so jolly that I sometimes
think I couldn't have stood being happy"; and his grim answer:
"It's a destructive experience."</p>

<p>Poor Frenside! Poor herself! For she had not known then what
happiness was, any more (she supposed) than he did. Destructive?
When the mounting flood of life was rumouring in her ears like
the sea? As well call spring destructive, or birth, or any of the
processes of renewal that forever mantle the ancient earth with
promise.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it feels like to remember," she said obscurely.
Vance's smile met hers. "How extraordinary!" she thought.
"Nothing that I say to him will need explaining..." It gave
her a miraculous winged sense, as though she were free of the
bonds of gravitation. "Oh, Vance, this--it's like flying!" He
nodded, and they stood silent, watching the silvery agitation of
the waters as the flank of the steamer divided them. Up and down
the deck people were scattering, disappearing. Rows of empty
deck-chairs stood behind the lovers. The passengers had gone to
look up their cabins, hunt for missing luggage, claim letters,
parcels, seats in the dining-saloon. Vance Weston and Halo
Tarrant seemed to have the ship to themselves.</p>

<p>It was a day of early September. Wind-clouds, shifting about
in the upper sky, tinged the unsteady glittering water with tones
of silver, lead and rust-colour, hollowed to depths of sullen
green as the steamer pressed forward to the open. The lovers were
no longer gazing back on the fading pinnacles of New York; hand
clasped over hand, they looked out to where the sea spread before
them in limitless freedom.</p>

<p>They had chosen a slow steamer, on an unfashionable line,
partly from economy, partly because of Halo's wish to avoid
acquaintances; and their choice had been rewarded. They knew no
one on board. Halo Tarrant, in the disturbed and crowded days
before her departure, had looked forward with impatience to the
quiet of a long sea-voyage. Her life, of late, had been so full
of unprofitable agitation that she yearned to set her soul's
house in order. Before entering on a new existence she wanted to
find herself again, to situate herself in the new environment
into which she had been so strangely flung. A few months ago she
had been living under the roof of Lewis Tarrant, bound to him by
ties the more unbreakable because they did not concern her
private feelings. She had regarded it as her fate to be a good
wife and a devoted companion to her husband for the rest of their
joint lives; it had never occurred to her that he would wish a
change. But she had left out of account the uneasy vanity which
exacted more, always more, which would not be put off with
anything less than her whole self, her complete belief, the
uncritical surrender of her will and judgment. When her husband
found she was not giving him this (or only feigning to give it)
he sought satisfaction elsewhere. If his wife did not believe in
him, his attitude implied, other women did--women whom this act
of faith endued with all the qualities he had hoped to find in
Halo. To be "understood", for Lewis Tarrant, was an active, a
perpetually functioning state. The persons nearest him must
devote all their days and nights, thoughts, impulses,
inclinations, to the arduous business of understanding him. Halo
began to see that as her powers of self-dedication decreased her
importance to her husband decreased with them. She became first
less necessary, then (in consequence) less interesting, finally
almost an incumbrance. The discovery surprised her. She had once
thought that Tarrant, even if he ceased to love her, would
continue to need her. She saw now that this belief was inspired
by the resolve to make the best of their association, to keep it
going at all costs. When she found she had been replaced by more
ardent incense-burners the discovery frightened her. She felt a
great emptiness about her, saw herself freezing into old age
unsustained by self-imposed duties. For she could not leave her
husband--she regarded herself as bound by the old debt on which
their marriage had been based. Tarrant had rescued her parents
from bankruptcy, had secured their improvident old age against
material cares. That deed once done would never be undone; she
knew he would go on supporting them; his very vanity compelled
him to persist in being generous when he had once decreed that he
ought to be. He never gave up an attitude once adopted as a part
of his picture of himself.</p>

<p>But then--what of her? She tried not to think of her
loneliness; but there it was, perpetually confronting her. She
was unwanted, yet she could not go. She had to patch together the
fragments of the wrecked situation, and try to use them as a
shelter.</p>

<p>And then, what would have seemed likely enough had it not been
the key to her difficulty, had after all come to pass. An infirm
old cousin died, and her will made Halo Tarrant a free woman. At
first she did not measure the extent of her freedom. She thought
only: "Now I can provide for my people; they need not depend on
Lewis--" but it had not yet dawned on her that her liberation
might come too. She still believed that Tarrant's determination
to keep whatever had once belonged to him would be stronger than
any other feeling. "He'll take the other woman--but he'll want to
keep me," she reasoned; and began to wonder how she could avoid
making her plea for freedom seem to coincide with her material
release. To appear to think that her debt could be thus cancelled
was to turn their whole past into a matter of business--and it
had begun by being something else. She could not have married
anybody who happened to have paid her parents' debts; that
Tarrant had done so seemed at the time merely an added cause for
admiration, a justification of her faith in him. She knew now
that from the beginning her faith had needed such support...
And then, before she could ask for her freedom, he had
anticipated her by asking for his; and, so abruptly that she was
still bewildered by the suddenness of the change, she found
herself a new woman in a new world...</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>All this she had meant to think over, setting her past in
order before she put it away from her and took up the threads of
the future. But suddenly she found herself confronted by a new
fact which reduced past and future to shadows. For the first time
in her life she was living in the present. Hitherto, as she now
saw, her real existence, her whole inner life, had been either
plunged in the wonders that art, poetry, history, had built into
her dreams, or else reaching forward to a future she longed for
yet dreaded. She had thought she could perhaps not bear to be
happy; and now she was happy, and all the rest was nothing. She
was like someone stepping into hot sunlight from a darkened room;
she blinked, and saw no details. And to look at the future was
like staring into the sun. She was blinded, and her eyes turned
to the steady golden noon about her. Ah, perhaps it was
true--perhaps she did not know how to bear happiness. It took her
by the inmost fibres, burned through her like a fever, was going
to give her no rest, no peace, no time to steady and tame it in
her dancing soul.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c02">II</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo had said: "Now you'll have your fill of the sea--" and
Vance Weston had smiled at the idea that ten days could be enough
of infinitude. Hitherto his horizon had been bounded by the
prairies of the Middle West or walled in between the cliffs of
the Hudson or the skyscrapers of New York. Twice only had he
drunk of that magic, in two brief glimpses which had seemed to
pour the ocean through his veins. If a lover can separate the
joys of love from its setting, he felt a separate delight in
knowing that his first days and nights with Halo were to be spent
at sea.</p>

<p>When his wife's death, and Halo Tarrant's decision to leave
her husband, had brought the two together a few months
previously, Vance had seen no reason for not seizing at once on
their predestined happiness. But Halo felt differently. When she
went to him with the news of her freedom she supposed him to be
separated from his wife, and thought that he and she might resume
their fraternal intimacy without offense to Laura Lou. Then, when
she had run him to earth in a shabby outskirt of New York, she
had discovered that he also was free, freed not by the law but by
the fact that his young wife had just died in the tumble-down
bungalow where Halo had found him. There she learned that there
had been no lasting quarrel between Vance and Laura Lou, and that
they had never separated. Expecting to find a deserted husband
she had encountered a mourning widower, and had been paralyzed by
the thought of declaring her love under the roof where Vance's
vigil by his wife's death-bed was barely ended. Vance had hardly
perceived the barrier that she felt between them. He lived in a
simpler moral atmosphere, and was quicker at distinguishing the
transient from the fundamental in human relations; but he would
have felt less tenderly toward Halo if she had not been aware of
that silent presence.</p>

<p>"But she's there, dearest--can't you feel it? Don't you see
her little face, so pleading and puzzled...as it was that day
when she was angry with me for going to see her, and turned me
out of her room--do you remember? Oh, Vance, it was all for love
of you--don't I <i>know?</i> I understood it even then; I loved
her for it. I used to envy her for having somebody to worship.
And now I see her, I feel her near us, and I know we must give
her time, time to understand, time to consent, to learn not to
hate me, as she would hate me at this minute if you and I were to
forget her."</p>

<p>Vance had never before thought of the past in that way; but as
he listened Halo's way became his, and her evocation of Laura
Lou, instead of paining or irritating him, seemed like saying a
prayer on a lonely grave. Such feelings, instinctive in Halo,
were familiar to Vance through the pity for failure, pity for
incomprehension, which glowed in his grandmother's warm blood.
New York and Euphoria called things by different names, and
feelings which in the older society had become conventionalized
seemed to require formulating and ticketing in the younger; but
the same fibres stirred to the same touch.</p>

<p>Vance and Halo, that spring evening, had parted after a long
talk. Halo had gone to join her parents at Eaglewood, their
country place above Paul's Landing; Vance had returned to his
family at Euphoria, with the idea of settling down there for a
year of writing, away from all the disturbances, material and
moral, which had so long hampered his work. By the end of the
year Halo would have obtained her divorce, his book (he was sure)
would be finished, and a new life could begin for both. Vance
meant to go on with the unfinished novel, "Magic," which had been
so strangely stimulated by his wife's illness, so violently
interrupted by her death. That sad fragment of his life was over,
his heart was free to feed on its new hopes, and he felt that it
would be easy, after a few weeks of rest, to return to his
work.</p>

<p>They had all been very kind at Euphoria. His father's business
was recovering, though his spirits were not. A younger and more
unscrupulous school of realtors had robbed Mr. Weston of his
former prominence. Though he retained its faint reflection among
his contemporaries he was a back number to the younger men, and
he knew it, and brooded over the thought that if things had gone
differently Vance might have been one of his successful
supplanters. Lorin Weston would have liked to be outwitted in
business by his own son. "I used to think you'd be a smarter
fellow than I ever was," he said wistfully. "And anyway, if you'd
come back and taken that job they offered you on the 'Free
Speaker' you could have given me enough backing to prevent the
Crampton deal going through without me. I was a pioneer of
Crampton, and everybody in Euphoria knows it. But those fellows
squared the 'Free Speaker' and so their deal with the Shunts
motor people went through without me. And it's not much more'n
three years ago that I sold that house your grandmother used to
live in for less than what Harrison Delaney got the year after by
the square yard for that rookery of his down the lane--you
remember?" Vance remembered.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," interrupted Mrs. Weston, in the nervous tone of
one who knows what is coming, and has heard it too often,
"there's no use your going over that old Delaney deal again. I
guess everybody has a chance once in their lives--and anyhow,
Harrison Delaney's waited long enough for his."</p>

<p>"Well, he <i>did</i> wait, and I couldn't afford to. He smelt
out somehow that Shunts Amalgamated were buying up everything
they could lay their hands on down Crampton way; and he pocketed
his million--yes, sir, one million--and sent for that girl of
his, who was on some job over at Dakin, and the story is they've
gone over to Europe to blow it in--gay Paree!" Mr. Weston jeered
a little mournfully. "Well, son, I always kinder hoped when you'd
worked the literature out of your system you'd come back and
carry on the old job with me; and if you had I guess we'd be
running Crampton today instead of the Shuntses."</p>

<p>However, the Euphoria boom was not confined to Crampton, and
Mr. Weston's improved situation enabled him to pay Vance's debts
(though the total startled him), and even to promise his son a
small allowance till the latter could get on his feet and produce
that surest evidence of achievement, a best-seller. "And he will
too, Vanny will; just you folks reserve your seats and wait," his
grandmother Scrimser exulted, her old blue eyes sparkling like
flowers through her tears.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess father'll be prouder of that than what he would
of a real-estate deal," Mae, the cultured daughter, remarked
sententiously.</p>

<p>"I will, the day he gets up to Harrison Delaney's figure," Mr.
Weston grumbled; but he circulated Mrs. Scrimser's prophecy among
his cronies, and Vance's fame spread about through Euphoria. The
women of the family (his grandmother not excepted) took even more
pride in the prospect of his marrying into one of the "regular
Fifth Avenue families." "Well, if they wouldn't listen to me I
guess they'll all be listening to <i>you</i> some day soon," Mrs.
Scrimser said, humorously alluding to an unsuccessful attempt she
had once made to evangelize fashionable New York. They all
gloated over a snap-shot of Halo which Vance had brought with
him, and his mother longed to give it to the "Free Speaker" for
publication, and to see Vance, on both literary and social
grounds, interviewed, head-lined and banqueted. But they were
impressed, if disappointed, by his resolve to defend his privacy.
He had come back home to work, they explained for him; one of the
big New York publishers was waiting for his new book, and showing
signs of impatience; and the house in Mapledale Avenue was
converted into a sanctuary where the family seer might vaticinate
undisturbed.</p>

<p>Never before in Vance's troubled life had he worked with an
easy mind. He had written the first chapters of "Magic" in an
agony of anxiety. Fears for his wife's health, despair of his own
future, regrets for his past mistakes, had made his mind a
battle-ground during the months before Laura Lou's death. Yet
through that choking anguish the fount of inspiration had forced
its way; and now that he sat secure under the Mapledale Avenue
roof, heart and mind at peace, the past at rest, the future
radiant, the fount was dry. Before he had been at home a week he
was starving for Halo, and stifling in the unchanged atmosphere
of Euphoria. He saw now that the stimulus he needed was not rest
but happiness. He had meant to send Halo what he wrote, chapter
by chapter; but he could not write. What he needed was not her
critical aid but her nearness. His apprentice days were over; he
knew what he was trying to do better than any one could tell him,
even Halo; what he craved was the one medium in which his
imagination could expand, and that was Halo herself.</p>

<p>For two or three months he struggled on without result; then,
after a last night spent in desperate contemplation of the blank
sheets on his desk, he threw his manuscript into his suit-case
and went down to announce his departure to the family. He
travelled from Euphoria to Paul's Landing as quickly as changes
of train permitted; and two days later rang the door-bell of
Eaglewood, and said to the Spears' old chauffeur, Jacob, who
appeared at the door in the guise of the family butler: "Hullo,
Jake; remember me--Vance Weston? Yes; I've just arrived from out
west; and I've got to see Mrs. Tarrant right off..."</p>

<p>That had happened in August; now, barely three weeks later,
Halo sat at his side in a corner of the liner's deck, and the
night-sea encircled them, boundless and inscrutable as their
vision of the future. There was no moon, but the diffused
starlight gave a faint uniform lustre to the moving obscurity.
The sea, throbbing and hissing in phosphorescent whirls about the
steamer's keel, subsided to vast ebony undulations as it
stretched away to the sky. The breeze blew against the lovers'
faces purified of all earthly scents, as if it had circled
forever over that dematerialized waste. Vance sat with his arm
about Halo, brooding over the mystery of the waters and his own
curious inability to feel their vastness as he had once felt it
from a lonely beach on Long Island. It was as if the sea shrank
when no land was visible--as if the absence of the familiar shore
made it too remote, too abstract, to reach his imagination. He
had a feeling that perhaps he would never be able to assimilate
perfection or completeness.</p>

<p>"It's funny," he said; and when Halo wanted to know what was,
he rejoined: "Well, when people tell me a story, and say: 'Here's
something you ought to make a good thing out of, if what they
tell me is too perfect, too finished--if they don't break off
before the end--I can't do anything with it. Snatches,
glimpses--the seeds of things--that's what story-tellers want. I
suppose that's why the Atlantic's too big for me. A creek's got
more of the sea in it, for people who want to turn it into
poetry."</p>

<p>She pressed closer to him. "That's exactly the theme of
'Magic', isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented; and sat silent. "Do you know, there's
another thing that's funny--"</p>

<p>"What else is?"</p>

<p>"Well, I used to think your eyes were gray."</p>

<p>"Aren't they?"</p>

<p>"They're all mixed with brown, like autumn leaves on a gray
stream."</p>

<p>"Vance, wouldn't it be awful if you found out that everything
about me was different from what you used to think?"</p>

<p>"Well, everything is--I mean, there are all sorts of lights
and shades and contradictions and complications."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall be like your subjects. If you get to know me
too well you won't be able to do anything with me. I suppose
that's why artists often feel they oughtn't to marry."</p>

<p>"What they generally feel is that they oughtn't to stay
married," he corrected.</p>

<p>"Well--it's not too late!" she challenged him.</p>

<p>"Oh, but they've got to marry first; artists have. Or some
sort of equivalent."</p>

<p>"You acknowledge that you're all carnivora?"</p>

<p>He turned and drew her head to his cheek in the dimness. "I
said perfection was what I hadn't any use for." Their laughter
mixed with their long kiss; then she loosed herself from his arms
and stood up.</p>

<p>"Come, Vance, let's go and look at the past for a minute."</p>

<p>"What's the past?"</p>

<p>She drew him along the deck, from which the last of the
passengers were descending to the light and sociability below;
they retraced the ship's length till they reached a point at the
stern from which they could see the receding miles of star-strown
ocean. "Look how we're leaving it behind and how it's racing
after us," Halo said. "I suppose there's a symbol in that. All
the things we've done and thought and struggled for, or tried to
escape from, leagued together and tearing after us. Doesn't it
make you feel a little breathless? I wonder what we should do if
they caught up with us."</p>

<p>Vance leaned on the rail, his arm through hers. The immensity
of the night was rushing after them. On those pursuing waves he
saw the outstretched arms of his youth, his parents, his
grandmother, Floss Delaney, Mrs. Pulsifer, the girls who had
flitted across his path, and the little white vision of Laura Lou
springing like spray from wave to wave. He pictured a man
suddenly falling over the ship's side, and seized and torn to
pieces by the pack of his memories--then he felt the current of
Halo's blood beating in his, and thought: "For a little while
longer we shall outrace them."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c03">III</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The monumental Spanish sky was full of cloud-architecture.
Long azure perspectives between colonnades and towers stretched
away majestically above an empty earth. The real Spain seemed to
be overhead, heavy with history; as if all the pictures, statues,
ecclesiastical splendours that Vance and Halo had come to see
were stored in the air-palaces along those radiant avenues. The
clouds peopled even the earth with their shadow-masses, creating
here a spectral lake in the dry landscape, there a flock of
cattle, or a hamlet on a hill which paled and vanished as the
travellers approached. All that Vance had ever read about mirages
and desert semblances rose in his mind as the motor-coach rolled
and swayed across the barren land.</p>

<p>The names of the few villages that they passed meant nothing
to him. The famous towns and cities of Spain already sang in his
imagination; but there were none on this road, and the clusters
of humble houses on bare slopes could not distract his attention
from that celestial architecture. At first he had been oppressed
by the emptiness of the landscape, its lack of any relation to
the labours and joys of men. Stretching away on all sides to the
horizon, the <i>tierras despobladas</i> seemed to lie under a
mysterious blight. But gradually he ceased to feel their gloom.
Under a sky so packed with prodigies it began to seem natural
that people should turn their minds and their interests away from
the earth. On the steamer he had read a little about the Spanish
mystics, in one of the books that Halo had brought; and now he
thought: "No wonder everything on earth seemed irrelevant, with
all those New Jerusalems building and re-building themselves
overhead."</p>

<p>As the sun declined, cloud ramparts and towers grew more
massive, nearer the earth, till their lowest degrees rested like
marble stairways on the hills. "Those are the ladders that
Jacob's angels went up and down," Vance mused; then the gold
paled to ashes, and the sky-palaces were absorbed into the dusk.
The motor-coach crossed a bridge and drove into a brown city,
through narrow streets already full of lights. At a corner Halo
asked the conductor to stop, and entrusted their bags to him.
"Come," she said; and Vance followed her across a wide court
where daylight still lingered faintly under old twisted trees.
She pushed open a door in a cliff-like wall, and they entered
into what seemed total darkness to eyes still blinking with
Spanish sunshine. Vance stood still, waiting for his sight to
return. It came little by little, helped by the twinkle of two or
three specks of flame, immeasurably far off, like ships' lights
in mid-ocean; till gradually he discerned through the obscurity
forms of columns and arches linked with one another in long
radiating perspectives. "The place is as big as that sky out
there," he murmured.</p>

<p>He and Halo moved forward. First one colonnade, low-vaulted
and endless, drew them on; then another. They were caught in a
dim network of architectural forms, perpetually repeated
abstractions of the relation between arch and shaft. The
similarity of what surrounded them was so confusing that they
could not be sure if they had passed from one colonnade to
another, or if the whole system were revolving with them around
some planetary centre still invisible. Vance felt as if he had
dropped over the brim of things into the mysterious world where
straight lines loop themselves into curves. He thought: "It's
like the feel of poetry, just as it's beginning to be born in
you"--that fugitive moment before words restrict the vision. But
he gave up the struggle for definitions.</p>

<p>The obscure central bulk about which those perpetual aisles
revolved gradually took shape as sculptured walls rising high
overhead. In the walls were arched openings; lights reflected in
polished marble glimmered through the foliation of wrought-iron
gates. Vance was as excited and exhausted as if he had raced for
miles over the uneven flagging. Suddenly he felt the desire to
lift his arms and push back the overwhelming spectacle till he
had the strength to receive it. He caught Halo's arm. "Come
away," he said hoarsely. Through the dimness he saw her look of
surprise and disappointment. She was used to these things, could
bear them. He couldn't--and he didn't know how to tell her. He
slipped his arm through hers, pulling her after him.</p>

<p>"But wait, dearest, do wait. This is the choir, the
high-altar, the Christian cathedral built inside...It's so
beautiful at this hour...Don't you want...?"</p>

<p>He repeated irritably: "Come away. I'm tired," knowing all the
while how he was disappointing her. He felt her arm nervously
pressed against his.</p>

<p>"Of course, dear. But what could have tired you? The hot sun,
perhaps...Oh, where's the door?" She took a few uncertain
steps. "There's only one left open. The sacristan saw us come in,
and is waiting outside. All the doors are locked at sunset; but
he's watching for us at the one we came in by. The thing is to
find it."</p>

<p>They began to walk down one of the aisles. Farther and farther
away in the heart of the shadows they left the great choir and
altar; yet they seemed to get no nearer to the door. Halo stood
still again. "No--this way," she said, with the abruptness of
doubt. "We're going in the wrong direction." Vance remembered a
passage in the Second Faust which had always haunted him: the
scene where Faust descends to the Mothers. "He must have wound
round and round like this," he thought. They had turned and were
walking down another low-vaulted vista toward a glow-worm light
at its end. This led them to a door bolted and barred on the
inner side, and evidently long unopened. "It's not that." They
turned again and walked in the deepening darkness down another
colonnade. Vance thought of the Cretan labyrinth, of Odysseus
evoking the mighty dead, of all the subterranean mysteries on
whose outer crust man loves and fights and dies. The blood was
beating in his ears. He began to wish that they might never find
the right door, but go on turning about forever at the dark heart
of things. They walked and walked. After a while Halo asked: "Are
you really tired?" like Eurydice timidly guiding Orpheus back to
daylight.</p>

<p>"No; I'm not tired any longer."</p>

<p>"We'll soon be out," she cheered him; and he thought: "How
funny that she doesn't know what I'm feeling!" He longed to sit
down at the foot of one of the glimmering shafts and let the
immensity and the mystery sweep over him like the sea. "If only
she doesn't tell me any more about it," he thought, dreading
architectural and historical explanations. But she slipped her
hand in his, and the touch melted into his mood.</p>

<p>At last they found the right door, and a key ground in
response to Halo's knock. Vance felt like a disembodied spirit
coming back to earth. "I'd like to go and haunt somebody," he
murmured. It was night outside, but a transparent southern night,
not like the thick darkness in the cathedral. The court with the
old twisted orange-trees was dim; but in the streets beyond there
were lights and shrill human noises, the smell of frying food and
the scent of jasmine. When they got back to the hotel and were
shown to their room, Vance said abruptly: "You go down to dinner
alone. I don't want anything to eat. I'd rather stay here..."</p>

<p>"You don't feel ill?" she asked; but he reassured her. "I'm
only overfed with the day..." She tidied her hair and dress,
and went down. It was exquisite to be with a woman who didn't
persist and nag. He flung himself on the bed, his nerves
tranquillized, and watched the stars come out through a tree
under the window. Those branches recalled others, crooked and
half-bare, outside of the window of the suburban bungalow where
he had nursed his wife in her last illness. They were
apple-branches; and he remembered how one day--a day of moral
misery but acute spiritual excitement--he had seen the subject of
his new book hanging on that tree like fruit. "Magic"--the story
he had meant to write as soon as he was free. And he had been
free for nearly a year, and had not added a line to it. But now
everything would be different. With Halo at his side, and the
world opening about him like the multiple vistas of that strange
cathedral, his imagination would have room to range in. He shut
his eyes and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The opening of the door made him start up, and he tumbled off
the bed as Halo entered. "It took forever to get anything to eat.
Did you wonder what had become of me?"</p>

<p>"No. I must have been asleep. But I'm as hungry as a cannibal.
Can't we go out somewhere and get supper?" He felt happy,
renewed, and as famished as a boy who has been sent to bed
dinnerless.</p>

<p>The streets hummed with nocturnal chatter. Gusts of scent blew
over secret garden-walls; and in the narrower thoroughfares of
the old town they caught, through open arch-ways, glimpses of
white courts with hanging lanterns, and plants about fountains,
and gossiping people grouped in willow armchairs. Halo's Spanish
was fluent enough to make her at ease in the scene, and she found
a little restaurant smelling of olive-oil and garlic, where
diners still lingered, and a saffron mound of rice and fish was
set before Vance. He revelled in the high-seasoned diet, the
thick sunny wine, the familiarity and noise of the friendly
place, the contrast between the solitude of the cathedral and the
crowded common life at its doors. He longed to wander from street
to street, listening to the overlapping gramophones, the snatches
of hoarse song, excited talk from door-step to door-step, the
wail of muleteers driving their beasts to the stable, the whine
of beggars on the steps of churches. It was strange and delicious
to be sitting there at ease with this young woman who knew what
everybody was saying, could talk to them, laugh with them, ask
the way, bandy jokes, and give him the sense of being at home in
it all.</p>

<p>After a while they got up and walked on. "Do you want to see
some dancing? I daresay we could find a place," Halo suggested,
as they caught a rattle of castanets from a packed
<i>caf&eacute;.</i> But Vance wanted to stay in the streets. He
liked to wander under the night-blue sky, and to speculate on
what was going on behind the white walls of the houses, and the
gates that were beginning to be shut on the darkened patios. They
strayed down one street after another, through little squares
shadowed with trees, to the market quarter around the cathedral,
where, at the base of those mute walls, the shrieking of
gramophones contended with the smell of fish and garlic. Then
they turned the flank of the cathedral, and followed an
unfrequented lane descending between convent-like buildings to
the river. All was hushed and dim. They went out to the middle of
the fortified bridge, and leaning on the parapet looked from the
sluggish waters below to the mountain-like mass of the great
church.</p>

<p>Vance gave a chuckle of satiety. "I don't believe I could bear
it if there was a moon!"</p>

<p>Halo had not spoken for a long while. "That's what I used to
feel about happiness," she said.</p>

<p>"That you couldn't bear it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well--and now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, now...you'll have to teach me..."</p>

<p>"Me? I never knew what it was, either...not this kind..."</p>

<p>"Is there any other?"</p>

<p>He pressed her close. "If there is, I've got no use for
it."</p>

<p>They stood listening to the sound of the lazy river. The
darkness drooped over them, low and burning as the curtains of an
Olympian couch; and Vance, holding his love, thought how little
meaning the scene would have had without her. He had seen it all
before, after all--in inklings, in scattered visions; at the
movies, at the opera, in the histories and travels he'd read; in
"Gil Blas" and Gautier and "The Bible in Spain"; in sham Spanish
caf&eacute;s and cabarets; who was going to tell him anything new
about Spain? The newness, the marvel, was in his arms, under his
lips--this girl who was his other brain, his soul and his flesh.
He longed to tell her so, in words such as no other woman had
heard; but the poverty of all words came over him. "See here,
let's go home to bed." They linked arms, and went back up the
hill to the hotel. It was so late that even a Spanish porter was
hard to rouse--but at length they climbed the stairs and stole
into their room. Through the window the smell of frying oil and
jasmine flowers blew in on them; and Vance wondered if in all his
life any other smell would be so mingled for him with the taste
of Halo's lips and eyelids.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c04">IV</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The next morning Vance announced that he meant to spend at
least a month at Cordova. He said "<i>I</i> mean," as naturally
as if the decision concerned only himself, and he would not for
the world have restricted his companion's liberty. But this was
not a surprise to Halo. She knew the irresistible force which
drove him in pursuit of the food his imagination required. It was
not that he was forgetful of her, but that, now they were
together, his heart was satisfied, while the hunger of his mind
was perpetual and insatiable.</p>

<p>In spite of herself she was slightly disconcerted by his
taking their plan of travel into his own hands. She, who had
worked it out so carefully, considering the season, the probable
weather, the number of days to be given to each place, saw that
all this meant nothing to him and reflected with a pang that she
had outgrown the age of impulse. It was seldom nowadays that she
remembered this difference between them. At first she had been
continually conscious that he was the younger, and this had kept
her from acknowledging to herself that she was in love with him.
Even afterward there were times when he had seemed a boy to her;
but now that they were lovers she felt in him a man's authority.
But in practical matters she was conscious of her greater
experience, and half-vexed at his not perceiving it.</p>

<p>"But, darling, you haven't seen Seville yet--or Murcia or
Granada. And we ought to go up to Ronda before the weather turns
cold. You've no conception of the wonders..."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a whimsical smile. "That's why..."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It takes me such a darned long time to deal with wonders. I'm
slow, I suppose. I don't care for more than one course at a
meal."</p>

<p>She shrugged a little impatiently. "Oh, don't use your
gastronomic preferences as an argument, dearest!"</p>

<p>"You mean they're too crude?"</p>

<p>"No; but they contradict your other theory. The theory that
artists need only a mouthful of each dish."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn artists! I just want to please Vance Weston," he
rejoined imperturbably, his arm about her shoulder. She laughed,
and kissed him; but inwardly she thought: "I must just adapt
myself; I must learn to keep step."</p>

<p>After all, wasn't it what she had wanted to marry him for? The
absorbing interest of seeing his gift unfold under her care had
been so interwoven with her love that she could not separate
them. But she liked to think that she loved him because she
believed in his genius, not that (as a simpler woman might) she
believed in his genius because she loved him. Yet here she was,
on the point of letting her petty habits of routine and order
interfere with his inspiration! What did it matter if they spent
the rest of the autumn at Cordova--or the rest of the year? "You
feel as if you could write here?" she suggested, remembering how
once before his art had flowered under her influence; and he
smiled back at her: "Just at this minute I feel as if I couldn't
write anywhere else." But they agreed that work would be
impossible in their one noisy room at the hotel, and Halo set out
to find quieter and roomier quarters. In her young days, before
her marriage to Tarrant had immersed the family in luxury, Mr.
and Mrs. Spear had taught their children that to combine
picturesqueness with economy was one of the pleasures of travel.
Scornful of the tourist who rated plumbing above local colour,
and had to content himself with what could be asked for in
English, the Spears, polylingual and ingratiating, gloried in the
art of securing "amusing" lodgings at famine prices. The gifts
developed in those nomad years came to Halo's aid, and before
night she had driven a masterly bargain with the owner of the
very quarters she wanted. The rooms were bare but clean, and so
high above the town that they commanded the jumble of roofs and
towers descending to the bridge, and a glimpse of the brown hills
beyond. Vance was enchanted, and the unpacking and settling down
turned the lovers into happy children. Though Vance lacked Halo's
skill in driving nails and mending broken furniture he shared her
love of order, and his good will and stronger muscles lightened
her task. Before long his room was ready, and at a carefully
consolidated table on which Halo had laid a fresh sheet of
blotting paper and a stack of "author's pads" of a blue that was
supposed to be good for the eyes, he sat down to his novel.</p>

<p>"Nobody ever fixed me up like this before," he said with a
contented laugh. She remembered the comfortless house in which
she had found him after Laura Lou's death, and wondered what
happiness could equal that of a woman permitted to serve the
genius while she adored the man.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's going to be as good a place for work as the
Willows?" She coloured at her allusion to the old house on the
Hudson, where she had spent so many hours with Vance while he was
writing "Instead"--the novel the critics had acclaimed, and his
publishers had resented his not consenting to repeat. All through
one fervid summer the two had met there, unknown to Vance's wife
and to Halo's husband. At that time she had imagined that she and
Vance were only friends; yet, though she had ceased to meet him
when his sudden outburst of passion broke down the feint, she
could not recall their stolen hours without compunction. But
there was none in Vance's eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm going to work a thousand per cent better here, because at
the Willows I was always in a fever for you, and you kept getting
in between me and my book."</p>

<p>"What a nuisance I must have been!" she murmured
hypocritically; and added, half laughing, half in earnest: "And
now--I suppose you already take me for granted?"</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and she saw in his the inward look which
sometimes made him appear so much older than his age. "Oh, my
soul--mayn't I?" he said; and: "Vance," she cried out, "what I
want is just to be like the air you breathe..."</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette, and leaned back, comfortably surveying the
blue pages. "That's only the beginning of all the things you're
going to be," he declared. He held out the bundle of cigarettes,
and she bent to light one from his, and stole to the door,
pausing to say: "Now I'm going to leave you to your work."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>She went to her own room to finish her unpacking; then she sat
down in the window, and let the waves of bliss flow over her.
More than once since she had left New York she had tried to look
into the future and picture her probable destiny; but while her
life held this burning core of passion she could fix her thoughts
on nothing else. She had been too starved and cold before; now
she could only steep herself in the glow.</p>

<p>No one would understand, she knew; least of all her own
family. Mr. and Mrs. Spear had always regarded themselves as free
spirits, and were certainly burdened with fewer social prejudices
than most of their friends and relations. Mrs. Spear had
specialized in receiving "odd" people at a time when New York was
still shy of them. She had welcomed at her house foreign
celebrities travelling with ladies unprovided with a marriage
certificate, and had been equally hospitable to certain
compatriots who had broken their marriage tie when such breaks
were a cause of scandal. But though she sympathized with
"self-expression", and the mystical duty to "live one's life",
and had championed the first adventurers in the new morality, she
had never expected any one belonging to her to join that band of
heroes. She was a Lorburn of Paul's Landing, and people of
pre-Revolutionary stock, however emancipated their sympathies,
conformed to tradition in their conduct. Mrs. Spear had herself
conformed. Her marriage had been a defiance, since she had
married out of her own set, or her own class, as her family would
have put it; but it was a defiance sanctioned by church and law,
and she had never dreamed of her daughter's taking liberties with
those institutions. Grieved as she was at Halo's leaving her
husband, Mrs. Spear had accepted it as inevitable, and had bowed,
after another struggle, to the further inevitability of her
daughter's re-marriage; but she had been genuinely shocked, and
deeply hurt, by Halo's decision to go away with her lover before
her divorce. Mrs. Spear had not been violent and denunciatory,
like her husband, whose resentment was doubled by the fact that
he could not air it in the newspapers. Mrs. Spear knew that the
day was past when parents, especially parents who have coquetted
with Bohemia, can call down curses on a dishonoured daughter. But
she did feel that Halo was dishonouring herself, and that every
influence should be used to save her. If the break with Tarrant
was unavoidable, why could not her daughter wait until he had
taken the necessary steps? "Lewis is always a gentleman. You must
admit that. You can count on his assuming all the blame," Mrs.
Spear had pleaded, her beautiful eyes full of persuasion and
perplexity.</p>

<p>"But, mother, supposing I'd rather share the blame--why
shouldn't I take the necessary steps for <i>that?"</i> Halo
rejoined, trying to evade her mother's entreaties. Mrs. Spear
merely replied: "Don't talk like your brother, please"--for Lorry
Spear was noted for his habit of dealing with serious questions
flippantly; and Halo, conscious of the ineffectualness of any
argument, could only repeat: "Mother, I must go with him--I must.
He needs me"--though she knew that to her mother such a plea was
worse than flippancy.</p>

<p>"If he really needs you, dear, he'll have the strength of
character to wait for you for a year. If he hasn't--" Mrs. Spear
left the ominous conclusion unspoken.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, mother darling, it's not that...I suppose you're
thinking of other women..." Halo felt herself burning inwardly
at the suggestion.</p>

<p>"It's not an unusual weakness--with artists especially," Mrs.
Spear drily interposed.</p>

<p>"No," Halo conceded; "I suppose we shouldn't have much art
without it...But what I mean is so different...He needs
me for his work...I can help him, I know I can..."</p>

<p>"Of course he'll make you think so--oh, it's all so unlike
you, darling!" cried poor Mrs. Spear, feeling herself as short of
arguments as her daughter.</p>

<p>"No, it's like me," Halo exclaimed passionately, "only I've
never really been myself before. Don't grudge me the chance." She
bent over, trying to kiss away her mother's tears; and on this
unsatisfactory conclusion they had parted.</p>

<p>At first Halo's view had differed little from Mrs. Spear's. To
wait till she was divorced, and go to Vance Weston as his wife,
had seemed the natural, the obvious arrangement. But when Vance
came back from Euphoria, ill-looking, unsettled, unable to work,
and pleading not to have his happiness postponed, she had given
way at once. She herself hardly knew whether passion or pity had
prevailed; but she felt, as she had said to her mother, that this
was her first chance to be her real self, and that no argument,
no appeal to social expediency or to loftier motives, should
deprive her of it. Words like dignity and self-respect seemed to
belong to an obsolete language. Her dignity, her self-respect!
What had become of them when she had endured to live with a
husband she despised? Yet she had remained with him for reasons
much less potent than those which called her to her lover. Was
she really the same woman who, on the steamer a few weeks
earlier, had hesitated over her lawyer's warning letter, and
asked herself whether she ought not to turn back? Now it was her
past that she was ashamed of, not her present; there were lyric
moments when her flight with Vance seemed like an expiation.</p>

<p>These phases of the struggle were over; she regarded them as
indifferently as if they had belonged to some other woman's
story. It was sweet to her now to know that she had gone to Vance
without hesitating. "In such a heaven as ours there's no marrying
or giving in marriage," she thought, as she sat there nursing her
happiness; and awed by the perfectness of her well-being she hid
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"What quiet there is in deep happiness," she mused. "How
little I ever imagined this lull in the middle of the whirlpool!"
But the stars still danced about her, and when she tried to
disentangle her mind from their golden whirl she felt a
lassitude, a reluctance she could not explain. "All that matters
is that he's sitting there next door, tranquil, happy, at work
again--and that it's my doing," she thought. She longed to open
his door and steal in, as she used to at the Willows, when he
would break off every now and then to read aloud what he had
written. But she remembered what he had said of her "getting in
between him and his book," and she went back to her seat,
reflecting that their moments together were no longer numbered,
and that her present task was to defend his privacy, not to
invade it.</p>

<p>The room was very still. The afternoon light, slowly veering,
left in shadow first one group of roofs and towers, then another;
the cloud-masses faded into twilight. At length Halo got up.
Their lodging was without electric light, and she was sure Vance
would not know how to light the oil-lamp she had put on his
table. She was glad of the excuse for joining him...</p>

<p>"Vance," she said, opening the door. No one answered, and she
saw that the room was empty. The door which led to the landing
was ajar--he had evidently gone out. Probably he had felt tired
after his hours of writing, and had wandered away without
thinking of telling her. She lit the lamp and looked about her.
Cigarette ends strewed the floor, and the blue writing pad on the
desk, immaculate, untouched, looked up at her ironically. He had
not written a line...</p>

<p>She stood struggling with a sense of disappointment. He had
seemed so sure that he wanted to go on with his work--that this
was the very place where it would come to him without an effort!
Well, what of that? Did she still imagine that an artist, a
creator, could always know in advance exactly in what conditions
and at what hour the sacred impulse would come?</p>

<p>She went back for her hat and coat, and descended the dark
narrow stairs. Slowly she sauntered through the streets that led
to the cathedral, peering with shortsighted eyes to right and
left in the hope of meeting him. Lamps had begun to twinkle in
the houses. Before long the sacristan would pass on his rounds
and close the cathedral doors. Halo thought: "He's surely in
there; I must find him before the place is locked up." She pushed
back the leather curtain and went in.</p>

<p>At first the darkness confused her. Each figure straying among
the shadows seemed to have Vance's outline; but as she drew
nearer she found herself mistaken. From aisle to aisle, from
Christian altar to Moorish <i>mihrab,</i> she explored the
baffling distances; but Vance was not there. She returned to the
outer world, and began to walk back through the modern quarter;
and suddenly, in front of a glittering caf&eacute;, she found him
installed at a table. He greeted her with a smile, and said:
"What will you have? I had to take a vermouth because it was all
I knew how to ask for."</p>

<p>"I've been hunting all over for you--" she began; then broke
off, annoyed by the maternal note in her voice. "I thought you
might want a Spanish drink, and an interpreter to order it," she
added laughing.</p>

<p>"No. I got on all right. I've been all up and down the place;
then I sat down here to watch the crowd." He waited while she
ordered a cup of coffee, and went on: "I couldn't write a line
after all."</p>

<p>"What you need is to take a good holiday first, and not bother
about your book."</p>

<p>His remote and happy smile enveloped her. "I'm not bothering
about anything on God's earth." He was looking at her curiously.
"Do you know, you've got just the shape of the head of one of
those statues of the Virgin they carry in the processions--you
remember: the one they showed us yesterday in that chapel? A
little face, long, and narrowing down softly to the chin--like a
fruit or a violin; the way yours does...God, I wish I could
draw! I believe I might have..." He leaned across and twisted
his fingers through hers. "What's the use of sight-seeing,
anyhow, when I've got you to look at?"</p>

<p>The blood rose to Halo's face. She felt a sudden shyness when
he looked at her with those eyes full of secret visions. How long
would it be before he had gone her round, and needed new food for
his dream? She thought: "Shall I have to content myself with
being a peg to hang a book on?" and found an anxious joy in the
idea.</p>

<p>When she had finished her coffee Vance pushed back the table.
"Come--let's go down to the bridge and listen to the river in the
dark...I don't believe I'll ever write a line again; not in
this place anyway," he declared serenely.</p>

<p> </p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo wondered at her own folly in imagining that Vance, with a
whole new world pressing on his imagination, would be able to
take up the thread of his work with the composure of a seasoned
writer. Life with him was teaching her more about the creative
processes. She saw that Vance himself had not yet taken his own
measure, or calculated the pressure of new sensations and
emotions on his inventive faculty. His impulse was either to try
to incorporate every fresh suggestion, visual or imaginative,
into the fabric of his work, or to build a new story with it; but
when the impressions were too abundant and powerful they benumbed
him.</p>

<p>For the moment he appeared to have lost even the desire to
store up his sensations. What he wanted was to study Spanish
history and art, to learn the language, to let the fiery panorama
roll past his idle imagination. If he had known how to paint, he
told Halo, that might have been an outlet. It was a pity, he
thought, he hadn't gone in for painting instead of
writing--painting, or perhaps sculpture. Some palpable
flesh-and-blood rendering of life, rather than the gray
disintegration of words. He recalled the hours he had spent in
New York, on the broken-hinged divan in the studio of the young
woman sculptor, Rebecca Stram, watching her mauling her clay...
"I tell you what it is: words are the last refuge of the
impotent. Writing is inexcusable in anybody who isn't blind or
paralyzed. It's an infirmity, a palsy--that's what it is. The
fellows who 'grab' life, as Goethe called it, are the conquerors
who turn it into form and colour...Damn words; they're just
the pots and pans of life, the pails and scrubbing-brushes. I
wish I didn't have to think in words...I sometimes feel as if
I had them in my veins instead of blood. Sometimes I even wish I
didn't have you to talk to, so that I could get away from words
forever...Why don't you tell me just to hold my tongue, and
live?"</p>

<p>This was one mood; but in others he declared that in yielding
to it he had blasphemed against the Holy Ghost. "The tongue of
fire descends on a man in one form or another, no knowing which;
all a fellow can do is to catch the flame and nurse it, whatever
it happens to produce...The other day I was haranguing you
about the difference between plastic expression and interpreting
things in words. Utter rubbish, of course. Why the deuce didn't
you tell me so? The difference is in the mind, not in the
material or the tool. If words are a man's tools he's got to
paint or model with <i>them...</i> or compose symphonies with
<i>them...</i> that's all. Look here, Halo--any idea what I've
done with vol. three of Prescott? No--? I had it with me
yesterday when we went out to Medina Zahara, didn't I? And my
Spanish grammar too! Lord, did I go and leave them both out
there, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>Halo sighed, and thought that as for the Prescott it didn't
really matter. She had brought with her all the latest and most
erudite works on Christians and Moors in the peninsula; but after
a glance at Dozy, and a little half-hearted plodding in Hume, he
had disappointed her by rejecting all her authors for Prescott
and Washington Irving. "But, Vance, dear, they were so
undocumented. Prescott was wonderful for his day, of course; but
so much that we know now was not available then. And as for
Washington Irving..." Vance laughed, and turned over on his
face in the grass where he and Halo were sitting, on the sunburnt
downs above Cordova. "Well, they just roll over me like waves,"
he said, leaning his chin on his locked hands and gazing down at
the ancient city. He lay there in silence, his brows wrinkled
against the glare, with now and then a faint tremor of the
nostrils, like the twitching of a sensitive animal's. Once he
stretched out a hand, stroking the short grass and plucking at a
clump of dwarf herbs that he crushed against his face. "Smells
like sun and incense--as if it was the breath of the old place."
He held out the tuft to Halo. It was hot and aromatic, full of
the flame of a parched earth and the vibration of bees. "It's
like my happiness," she thought. She lay there in an idle
ecstasy. Overhead a great bird of prey circled against the blue;
and Halo remembered how she had once thought of happiness as
something bright-winged, untameable, with radiant alien eyes. Now
the wings were folded and the strange guest lay asleep in her
heart. She was no more afraid of it than a young mother is of her
child; only perpetually conscious of it, watching it with wakeful
eyes, as the mother watches while her child sleeps. And she
thought: "If I could get quite used to it perhaps it would get
used to me too, and never stir. If only I could learn to stop
watching it."</p>

<p>Vance raised himself on his elbow. "See here," he broke out,
"what I really want is to write poetry. From the very first I've
always felt inside of myself that for me it was that or nothing.
All the rest is just pot-boiling. Using words to tell stories
with is like paving the kitchen-floor with diamonds. God! Words
are too beautiful to be walked over in that way, with muddy feet,
like the hall oil-cloth. Supposing Keats had used <i>his</i>
words to write best-sellers with? Don't it strike you like
turning a Knights of Pythias picnic loose down there in the
cathedral? Words ought to be received at the door of the mind
with lighted torches and incense and things--like one of the big
church ceremonies you described to me. See here, Halo--when did
you say they danced before the altar of the cathedral at Seville?
I wish I could get that into poetry..."</p>

<p>The bright confusion of his mind sometimes charmed and
sometimes frightened her. She was so much afraid of laying clumsy
hands on his capricious impulses that she felt herself sinking
into the character of the blindly admiring wife. Yet that had not
been her dream, or his. She remembered how her frank criticism
had guided and stimulated him while he was writing "Instead", and
she did not quite know why she had become so uncertain and shy in
talking with him of his literary plans, so fearful of
discouraging or misdirecting him. Sometimes she asked herself if
it would not have been better if they had stayed in America, in
some out-of-the-way place where this tremendous vision of a new
world would not have thrust itself between him and his work. Yet
she felt it must be a weak talent that could not bear the shock
of wonder and the hardening processes of experience. Presently
the mass of new impressions would be sorted out and dominated by
his indefatigable mind, and become a part of its material--and
meanwhile, what mattered but that he and she were together, with
these waves of beauty breaking over them? All she had to do was
to hold her breath and wait. She slipped her hand in his. "Do you
remember when you read me your first poetry, that morning up on
Thundertop?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A few days later Vance came in from one of his dreaming
rambles about Cordova, and said, with illuminated eyes: "I've met
a man who says we're fools not to go straight off to
Granada."</p>

<p>Halo could not repress a feint movement of impatience. It was
a little exasperating to have this information imparted as a
novelty. Vance seemed to have no recollection of her having told
him repeatedly that they ought to get to Granada before the rainy
weather began.</p>

<p>"A man? What sort of a man?"</p>

<p>"He said his name was Alders," said Vance, as if that settled
everything.</p>

<p>Halo made a hasty mental calculation of the probable cost of
cancelling the lease of their lodgings, which they had had to
take for the rest of the season. The landlady would certainly be
nasty; but Halo had fought such battles before, and instantly
began sharpening her mental weapons. "Well, all right. Do you
want me to get ready?"</p>

<p>"He says we ought to," Vance repeated serenely.</p>

<p>For the next two or three days he vanished frequently to
rejoin his new friend. Halo gathered that Alders was a wandering
American who wrote--at least he was planning a book on Saint
Theresa. "For the present he's just letting Spain soak into him,"
Vance explained. He did not offer to produce Alders for Halo's
inspection, and she did not suggest that he should. She was
beginning to realize that in throwing in her lot with Vance's she
had entered into an unknown country--as unknown to her as Spain
was to him, and with far fewer landmarks to guide her. When Lewis
Tarrant made a new acquaintance, and imparted the fact to his
wife, his words at once situated the person in question, socially
and intellectually. But Vance could not situate anybody. He could
only say that he liked a fellow, or didn't like him. He seemed to
think that in some mysterious way the impressions he could not
sum up in words would be telepathically communicated to Halo; but
this was impossible, for they had no common ground of reference.
Halo tried to bridge the gulf by declaring cheerfully: "Well, I'm
sure I'll like him if you do," but Vance answered, with a sort of
school-boy vagueness: "Oh, I dunno that I like him as much as all
that," making no allusion to Halo's possible opinion of Alders.
He seemed to regard Alders as exclusively his own, as a child
might a new toy.</p>

<p>A few more days passed; then Vance suddenly announced that he
thought it would be fun to go over to Granada in the touring car
that was starting the next morning. Could Halo be ready, did she
think? After another mental readjustment she said, yes, of
course, if he'd be home in the afternoon in time to pack his
things; to which he cheerfully agreed.</p>

<p>At the tourist agency Vance surprised her by engaging three
seats. Alders, he said, was going to Granada too, and had asked
to have his ticket taken for him. An exclamation of annoyance was
on Halo's tongue; but she repressed it, and bought the
ticket.</p>

<p>The next morning, when they arrived at the square from which
the car started, Vance said: "Here's Alders," and a nondescript
young man in a shabby gray suit came forward. He greeted Halo
with an awkward bow, and started to climb to Vance's side; but at
the last moment he bent over to say something to the conductor,
as the result of which he was transferred to a seat several rows
behind them, and a girl with large horn spectacles and a portable
gramophone was pushed into his place. Vance laughed. "You scared
him--he's as shy as a hawk." He seemed content to know that his
new friend was making the journey with them, and bound for the
same destination.</p>

<p>At Granada they went for a night to an hotel in the town, and
the next morning Vance proposed that they should look for rooms
in one of the English <i>pensions</i> on the Alhambra hill.
Alders, who knew the place well, had given him several addresses;
and though Halo was beginning to resent Alders's occult
participation in their affairs, she agreed to the suggestion. But
half way up the hill Vance deserted her, captivated by the
carolling of fountains under the elms, and the shadowy invitation
of the great Moorish archway. "See here, Halo--this beats
everything. Do you mind if I wait for you here while you look for
rooms? I shouldn't be any good anyway," he said persuasively; and
Halo, admitting the fact, went on alone.</p>

<p>On the hillside below the hotels she wandered about,
consulting Alders's list, till a dusty stony lane ended
unexpectedly at a gate inscribed: "English Pension. View.
Afternoon Tea"; and in a tumble-down house among oranges and
pomegranates she was shown two rooms high up on a roof-terrace.
The rooms were comfortless, and not too clean; but the terrace
overhung the fairest landscape on earth. Halo concluded her
bargain and hurried back rejoicing to the Alhambra. She was
impatient to lead Vance up to this magical proscenium, and hear
his cry at first sight of the snow peaks and green plain. She
found him curled up in a coign of the wall above the city. He
seemed to have forgotten the errand on which she had left him,
and protested at being obliged to leave his warm corner. "What's
the use of finding such a place if you come and root me out of
it?" "I've found something even better--come and see!" she
exulted; and reluctantly he let her lead him out of the Alhambra
and up the hill. But when she introduced him to the terrace he
cried out: "Say, are we really going to live here? Why the devil
did you let me waste all that time at Cordova? Alders <i>told
me</i>--"</p>

<p>Halo laughed ironically. "I told you long before Alders. Only
you're so used to the sound of my voice that I don't believe you
hear it any longer."</p>

<p>He was looking at her with beauty-drunk eyes. "Maybe I don't,"
he agreed contentedly, turning back to lean over the parapet.
Halo could not help being a little vexed that they should owe the
discovery of this vantage-ground to Alders. She might easily have
found it herself--but it was in pursuance of his indications that
she had turned down that uninviting lane. She wished she were
able to feel more grateful.</p>

<p>Alders came up to see if they were satisfied. He himself
lodged, mysteriously, somewhere below in the town; but he was
always on the Alhambra hill. That first day they asked him to
tea, in one of the little tearooms near the Alhambra, and
afterward he walked up with them to the Generalife. His shyness
in Halo's presence persisted--or at any rate, his reserve. For
she was never, then or afterward, sure if he were shy or merely
indifferent, any more than she could decide if he were young or
old. She could barely remember, when he was out of sight, what he
looked like. There was something shadowy and indefinite about his
whole person. His dullish sandy hair merged into the colour of
his skin, his thin lips were of the same tint as his small
unkempt moustache. She had seen straw-coloured and sand-coloured
people, but never any whom protective mimicry had provided with
so complete a neutrality. His manner was neutral too, if anything
could be called a manner which seemed rather a resigned endurance
of human intercourse. Judging from Mr. Alders's attitude one
would have supposed that his one aim was to avoid his fellow
beings; but Halo presently discovered that this shrinking
exterior concealed a ravenous sociability.</p>

<p>She recognized in him the roving American with a thin glaze of
culture over an unlettered origin, and a taste for developing in
conversation theories picked up in random reading, or evolved
from an imperfect understanding of art and history. He told them
that among his friends (he implied that they were few but
illustrious) he was known as "The Scholar Gypsy"--adding that the
name (taken, he smilingly explained, from a poem by Matthew
Arnold) had been conferred on him because of his nomadic habits;
perhaps also, he concluded, of his scholarly tastes. He made
these boasts with such disarming modesty that Halo could not
resent them, though she failed to understand the impression they
produced on Vance. But gradually she discovered that under his
literary veneer Alders possessed a miscellaneous accumulation of
facts and anecdotes about places and people. His mind was like
the inside of one of the humble curiosity-shops on the way up to
the Alhambra, where nothing was worth more than a few pesetas;
but these odds and ends of cosmopolitan experience amused Vance,
and excited his imagination, though Halo noticed that he was less
impressed by them than by Alders's views on Croce or Spengler, or
the origin of religious mysticism in Western Europe. Vance's
ravenous desire to learn more and more--to learn, all at once,
everything that could be known on every subject--was stimulated
by his new friend's allusions and references, and Halo saw that
he ascribed her own lukewarm share in their talks to feminine
inferiority. "Of course general ideas always bore women to
death," he said in a tone of apology, as they climbed to their
pension after a long afternoon with Alders at the Alcobazar. "But
you see I was pretty well starved for talk out at Euphoria--and
in New York too. God! When I think of the raw lumps of ignorance
those fellows used to feed me, at the Cocoanut Tree and at
Rebecca Stram's...I tell you what, Halo, going round with a
man like Alders, who's got art and philosophy at his fingers'
ends--"</p>

<p>She was on the point of interrupting: "Yes, but only there--"
but she saw Vance's glowing face, and understood that he was
getting from his new friend something which a scholar like George
Frenside might not have been able to give him. There was
excitement in the very confusion of Alders's references, and
reassurance in their audacity. Vance seemed to feel that he too
might become a scholar after a few more talks with Alders, and
that the wisdom of the ages might emerge from a breathless
perusal of Samuel Butler and Havelock Ellis.</p>

<p>It was hard on Halo to have it thought that such flights were
beyond her; but she told herself again that at this stage her
business was to hold her breath and watch. Though she resented
Alders's incursion into their lives she was relieved that Vance
did not expect her to share in his confabulations with his new
friend; and she came to see how natural it was that to a youth
who had lacked all artistic and intellectual training the other's
shallow culture should seem so deep. The clever young writers he
had known in New York had read only each other and "Ulysses";
here was a man full of the curious lore of the past, who could at
any rate put the Cocoanut Tree clan in their true
perspective.</p>

<p>This hunger and thirst of Vance's was all the more touching to
Halo because she knew that his eagerness to learn everything at
once was due not to superficiality but to the sense of time lost
and of precious secrets kept from him. "If only I'd had Alders's
advantages!" he burst out one evening, in passionate
retrospection; and she could not help answering: "It was funny,
though, his thinking you'd never heard of Matthew Arnold."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't believe those Cocoanut Tree fellows have; or if
they have, they've thrown him overboard without reading him. They
haven't got time to embalm dead bodies, they say--leave that to
the morticians. And there they sit and talk endlessly all day
long about nothing! Look here, Halo--I sometimes think I was
meant to be a student and not a writer; a 'grammarian', like the
fellow in the Browning poem. Alders was telling me last night how
many years the Jesuit novitiate lasts--he thought at one time of
being a Jesuit. Well, I tell you what, it gave me a big idea of
those old fellows who weren't afraid of being left behind...
weren't always trying to catch up...catch up with
<i>what?</i> Why; just with other fellows who were trying to
catch up. Did you ever think of the beauty of not giving a damn
if you were left behind?"</p>

<p>Yes; in those ways Alders was good for him. His talk was a
blurred window; but through it the boy caught glimpses of the
summits. Halo could have given him a clearer sight of them; but
she recognized that the distance was yet too great between her
traditional culture and Vance's untutored curiosities. This
dawdling Autolycus, with his bag of bright-coloured scraps, might
serve as a guide where she was useless.</p>

<p>Luckily there were days when Alders was off on his own
mysterious affairs, and Halo had her lover to herself. Then life
burned with beauty, and every hour was full of magic. Vance's
successive declarations that he meant to write poetry, to take up
painting, to immure himself in a scholar's cell, no longer
frightened her. It was enchanting to watch the tumult of his
mind, sun-flecked, storm-shadowed, subsiding in moonlit calm or
leaping sky-ward in sun and gale. This journey was a time of
preparation from which his imagination would come forth richer
and more vigorous. Occasionally she wished his idleness were not
so total, for she was afraid the lost habit of work might be hard
to recover; but when she hinted this, he rejoined that she didn't
understand the way the creative mind was made. "There's Alders,
now--I suppose you might think he was loafing...Well, he's
<i>amassing.</i> A very different thing. He told me he might very
likely lie fallow another year before he wrote the first line of
his book about the influence of Byzantine art on El Greco."</p>

<p>"On <i>what?</i> I thought he was collecting material for a
life of St. Theresa."</p>

<p>Vance frowned impatiently. "Yes; he was. But he's put that
aside, because he felt he ought to go into sixteenth century art
in Spain before he tackles mysticism. He says you can approach
spiritual phenomena only from the outside; the way they manifest
themselves in art and architecture and the whole social
structure...If you don't get that into your system first..."</p>

<p>Halo made no answer, and Vance continued, still in a slightly
irritated tone: "I don't suppose you want me to be like those
fellows that are sent to Europe for a year on a college
scholarship, and are expected by the Faculty to come back with a
masterpiece? I've heard you on the subject of those masterpieces.
And a novel isn't a thesis anyhow--it's a live thing that's got
to be carried inside of you before it can be born. I suppose I'm
a trial to you sometimes," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Only when you imagine that I don't understand." But he
protested that he never did; and side by side on their high-hung
terrace they watched the full moon push up above the Sierra.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Their rooms were not easy to warm, and the October winds began
to rattle the windows; but Halo and Vance were loth to leave, and
they always managed to find a warm corner in the courts of the
Alhambra, or sheltered by the ilexes of the Generalife, where
Vance could "lizard" in the sun, and turn over his dreams like
bright-coloured shells and pebbles. He had begun again to discuss
his literary plans with Halo; but he only toyed with them as
distant possibilities. He still seemed to regard his genius as a
beautiful capricious animal, to be fed and exercised when it
chose, and by him alone; and she forbore to remind him of the
days when her nearness had seemed necessary to inspire his work,
and her advice to shape it. She told herself that in becoming his
mistress she had chosen another field of influence, that to be
loved by him, to feel his passionate need of her, was a rapture
above the joys of comradeship; but in her heart she had dreamed
of uniting the two. She was learning now that the ways of nature
were slower and more devious than her sentimental logic had
foreseen; and she tried to lose herself in the rich reality of
her love.</p>

<p>Now and then they spoke of leaving Granada; but the talk did
not reach any practical conclusion. Their plans offered to Vance
as many alluring alternatives as his literary future, and what he
liked best was to lie stretched out on the warm red wall of the
Alhambra and dream of being elsewhere.</p>

<p>Alders, by his own account, had many friends in Granada--he
talked especially of an old Marquesa who lived in a palace behind
the cathedral, with a statue of a captive Moor over the door. The
old Marquesa, Alders said, was an authentic descendant of
Bobadilla's, a wonderful woman in whose veins flowed the purest
blood of Castilian and Moorish chivalry. One met at her house the
oddest and most interesting specimens of the old Andalusian
aristocracy. Regular pal&aelig;oliths, they were; it would be a
wonderful chance for Weston to document himself in such a
prehistoric <i>milieu,</i> especially as he was thinking of
laying the scene of his next novel in Spain..."Oh, are you?"
Halo interrupted, glancing eagerly at Vance, who said, well, he'd
had an idea lately that something amusing might be done with a
young American in the wine business, sent to study the trade at a
Spanish port in the eighteen thirties, say...</p>

<p>Alders declared that the possibilities of such a subject were
immense, and he proposed that he and Vance should go to the
Marquesa's that very evening; the lady, it appeared, still kept
up the picturesque custom of the nightly <i>tertulia,</i> an
informal reception at which people came and went as they pleased
till daylight. Alders explained this to Halo in his shy halting
way, and though she doubted the antiquity of the Marquesa's
lineage, and even its authenticity, she assumed that Alders
na&iuml;vely believed in them, and wondered how, without
offending him, she could decline to be of the party. But he
continued, more and more hesitatingly: "You don't mind, do you,
Mrs. Weston, if I carry off Weston this once? It's all in the
interest of his work...an exceptional opportunity..." Halo
disliked being asked by a man like Alders if she "minded"
anything that Vance chose to do; and her laugh perhaps betrayed
her irritation. "I'm sure it will amuse you--you'd better go,"
she said to Vance, as if it were he who had made the suggestion.
There were times when she could not help treating Alders as if
she had not noticed that he was there.</p>

<p>The next morning she gathered from Vance that the Marquesa was
in fact a rather splendid figure, in a vast mouldy palace with
"huge things hanging on the walls--you know--," and a lot of
people coming and going, men and women, eating ices and talking a
great deal. His vague description gave Halo the impression that
he had been among people of the world, and she was annoyed, in
spite of herself, that Vance should have figured as the hanger-on
of Alders.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've had a glimpse of Spanish society; but it's
rather odd that your friend didn't think of asking me to go with
you." The words really reflected her dislike of Alders rather
than any resentment at not being included in the party; but when
they were spoken she felt how petty they sounded. "Of course,"
she added quickly, "I didn't want to go--that sort of thing bores
me to tears; I merely meant that if Alders had known a little
more about the ordinary social rules he would have felt he ought
at least..." She stopped, silenced by the colour that rose to
Vance's forehead.</p>

<p>"Vance--" she exclaimed, in sudden anger, "do you mean it was
because...Does Alders know that we're not married?"</p>

<p>Vance looked at her in surprise. "Why, of course he knows. I
told him the very first thing how splendid you'd been...
coming to me straight off, like that...he thought it was
great of you..."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't please! I mean, I don't need Alders's approval--."
She could hardly tell why she was so indignant; had she been
asked point-blank if she were Vance Weston's wife she would
certainly have denied it, and have said that she called herself
so only for the convenience of travel. But this concerned only
herself and Vance, and the discovery that he had been talking her
over with a stranger picked up at a caf&eacute; was intolerable
to her. Alders, of course, had cross-questioned Vance to satisfy
his insatiable craving for gossip; but how could Vance have
fallen into such a trap?</p>

<p>"Why, you don't mind, do you? I thought you'd have despised me
for pretending," Vance began; but without heeding him she
interrupted: "That was the reason, then! He proposed to you to go
with him alone because he knew you were travelling with your
mistress, and he couldn't have asked his Marquesa to receive me?
Was that it?"</p>

<p>Vance reddened again. "He said how funny and fossilized that
kind of people were...but I never thought you'd care; you
always seem to hate seeing new people."</p>

<p>"Of course I don't care; and of course I hate seeing people I
don't know anything about..."</p>

<p>"Well, then that's all right," said Vance.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you call all right. Most men would resent
such a slight--"</p>

<p>"What slight?"</p>

<p>She saw that his perplexity was genuine, but that made it none
the less irritating. There were moments when Vance's moral
simplicity was more trying than the conventionalities she had
fled from.</p>

<p>"Can't you see--?" she began; and then broke off. "I sometimes
think you keep all your psychology for your books!" she exclaimed
impatiently.</p>

<p>"You mean there are times when you think I don't understand
you?"</p>

<p>"You certainly don't at this moment. I won't speak of the good
taste of discussing our private affairs with a stranger--but that
you shouldn't see that any slight to a woman in my situation..."</p>

<p>"What about your situation?" he interrupted. "I thought you
chose it--freely."</p>

<p>"When I did, I imagined you would know how to spare me its
disadvantages!"</p>

<p>He stood silent, looking down at the rough tiles of their
bedroom floor. Halo was trembling with the echo of her own words.
The consciousness that their meaning was not the same to him made
her feel angry and helpless. An impenetrable wall seemed to have
risen between them.</p>

<p>"You mean that you hate our not being married?" he brought
out, as if the idea were new to him.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do, when you put me in a position that makes it
hateful."</p>

<p>"Like that old woman last night not wanting to receive you? It
never occurred to me you'd want her to."</p>

<p>"Or that you ought not to have gone yourself, if she didn't
want me?" His eyes were again full of surprise. Halo laughed
nervously.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," he went on. "I thought you didn't care a
straw about that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't if I felt you knew how to protect me."</p>

<p>She saw from his expression that her meaning was still
unintelligible to him, and that he was struggling to piece her
words together.</p>

<p>"What is there to protect you from?"</p>

<p>"Vance--if you can't understand!" She paused, her heart in a
tumult. "How does your mother feel about the way we're living
together?" she broke out abruptly.</p>

<p>A shade of embarrassment stole over his face. "How on earth do
I know?"</p>

<p>"Of course you know! She hates it--and me, probably. I daresay
she wouldn't receive me if I went to Euphoria with you. And my
mother hates it quite as much. My going away with you like this
made her terribly unhappy. And yet you say you don't
understand--!"</p>

<p>"Oh, see here, Halo--if that's what you mean! Of course I know
how my mother feels about marriage in general. It's all nonsense
about her not receiving you; but I daresay she's unhappy about
our being together in this way. The marriage ceremony is a kind
of fetish to her. And I suppose your mother feels the same. But I
never thought you would. I thought that for you our being
together like this--so close and yet so free--was more than any
marriage. I never dreamed you didn't look at it as I do. I
thought you'd always felt differently from the people around you
about the big things of life."</p>

<p>Halo was silent. She was bewildered by his incomprehension,
yet moved by his evident sincerity. "You're terribly logical--and
I suppose life isn't," she said at length, forcing a smile.</p>

<p>Vance stood before her, his gaze again bent on the floor. She
saw that he felt the distance between them, and was wondering how
to bridge it over. "I guess you worry about a lot of things that
I haven't yet learned to take into account. What do you think we
ought to do?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>The blood seemed to stop in her veins. She looked at him
helplessly. "To do--to do?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," he interrupted, "the real trouble is that you
don't like Alders."</p>

<p>This flash of insight startled her. She was beginning to see
that though the conventional rules of life still perplexed him,
and perhaps always would, he was disconcertingly close to its
realities.</p>

<p>"If you don't want me to go around with Alders, I won't, of
course. He said the other day he thought maybe you didn't want me
to."</p>

<p>The mention of Alders renewed her irritation.</p>

<p>"How can you think I want to interfere with you in any way?
What I can't understand is your lowering yourself to talk me over
with a stranger."</p>

<p>There was another silence, and she began to tremble inwardly.
To discuss things with him was like arguing with some one who did
not use the same speech.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm the stranger here, Halo. I can't understand your
supposing that I'd speak of you to anybody in a way that could
lower either you or me. I don't yet know what's made you
angry."</p>

<p>"Angry? I'm not angry! I can't bear to have you speak of me as
if I were a silly woman with a grievance."</p>

<p>"I suppose everything I say is bound to sound to you like
that, as long as I don't understand what the grievance is."</p>

<p>"When a man says he doesn't understand a woman it's because he
won't take the trouble."</p>

<p>"Or feels it's useless."</p>

<p>"Is that what you feel?"</p>

<p>"Well--maybe I will, soon."</p>

<p>"No. Don't be afraid! I shan't be here then--"</p>

<p>She heard the echo of her own words, and broke off dismayed. A
longing overcame her to be taken into his arms and soothed like a
foolish child. Of course that would come in a moment. She felt
her whole body drawing her to him; but though she waited he did
not move or speak. He seemed remote, out of hearing, behind the
barrier that divided them. She thought: "He's been through scenes
like this with Laura Lou, and he's sick of them...He thought
that with me everything was going to be different..."</p>

<p>At length Vance said slowly: "You must do whatever you want."
She did not speak, and he added: "I guess I'll go out for a
walk." His voice sounded cold, almost indifferent. How could she
have imagined he was waiting to snatch her to his breast? He was
simply counting the minutes till their senseless discussion was
over, and he could make his escape. His inflexible honesty was
deadly--she felt herself powerless against it, and could think of
nothing to say. He took up his hat and went out, carrying her
happiness with him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c07">VII</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo sat alone among the ruins. It was one of the moments when
life seems to turn and mock one's magnanimity. When she had torn
up her lawyer's letter, and cast in her lot with Vance's, she
fancied she was tearing up all the petty restrictions of her
past. In her new existence the meaner prejudices would no longer
reach her. All the qualities in her which could serve the man she
loved--her greater experience, her knowledge of the world, her
familiarity with Vance's character, her faith in his
genius--seemed to justify her decision. It was to be her
privilege to give him what he had always lacked: intellectual
companionship and spiritual sympathy. And now, for a whim, for
nothing, she had risked her hard-won happiness and dropped to the
level of any nagging woman--all because he had unwittingly
offended the very prejudices from which she imagined he had
delivered her!</p>

<p>The worst of it was that she was no untaught girl among the
first pitfalls of passion. Psyche turning her lamp on the secret
face of love was a novice; Halo Tarrant knew the ways of men, yet
at the first occasion she had repeated Psyche's blunder. She had
found out now how little importance Vance attached to the idea of
marriage--and she had shown him the social value it had for her.
Everything that she had meant to leave undefined and fluid in
their relation her own act had forced him to define and
crystallize, and thereby she had turned the lamp on her own face.
Yet she could not help feeling as she had felt. Her relations
with the men she had grown up among had been regulated by a code
of which Vance did not know the first word, and she now saw how
such tacit observances may be inwoven with the closest human
intimacies.</p>

<p>"Laura Lou couldn't understand a word of what he wrote or
thought; but in my place she would have known at once that in
discussing her situation with a stranger he was only proving his
admiration for her." And she recalled a whimsical axiom of George
Frenside's: "No passion can survive a woman's seeing her lover
hold his fork in the wrong way."</p>

<p>The absurdity of it shook her out of her depression. Yes, a
real passion could; she meant to prove it! She would show Vance
that she understood his heart as well as his brain. She would
propose to him to have Alders to dine that very evening, she
would even suggest Vance's going off on a trip with his new
friend if he wanted to. She would prove to him that her only
happiness was in knowing that he was happy. Already she marvelled
that anything else had seemed of the least moment...</p>

<p>The hours went by, and she sat alone in the dreary pension
room. Rain-clouds hung low on the Sierra; summer seemed to have
passed with the passing of her unclouded hours. She recalled
Vance's impulsiveness, his moody fits. What if he had taken the
train and gone off, heaven knew where, away from her tears and
her reproaches? He would come back, of course; in her heart she
was sure of him; but meanwhile what irreparable thoughts might he
not be thinking?</p>

<p>She went down alone to lunch; then she rambled out aimlessly,
hoping to run across him in some corner of the Alhambra hill. But
a bleak wind blew over the ramparts, shaking the leaves from the
elms, and she returned, chilled and discouraged, without having
found him. She thought to herself: "I ought to have gone with him
when he went out. I ought not to have let him carry away that
distorted image of me...I ought to have done something, said
something, that would have blotted it out before his eyes had
grown used to it...And I stood there, and couldn't think of
anything!"</p>

<p>She recalled her differences with Lewis Tarrant, the
low-pitched quiet conflicts from which she always emerged more
worn than after a noisy quarrel. No doubt Vance was feeling at
this moment as she used to feel after those arid arguments. He
would never say of her again that she was like the air he
breathed! She sat down and rested her tired head on her arms.</p>

<p>She was still sitting there when the door opened and he came
in. At the turn of the door-handle she knew he was there, and
sprang up. "Vance--!" She stood looking at him, filling her eyes
with his face as if he had come back from the dead.</p>

<p>He gave a shy laugh, and one hand fumbled in his pocket. "You
liked this the other day--." He pulled out a little packet.
"Here." He pushed it into her hand. She was touched by the
boyishness of the gesture; but instantly she thought: "He used to
make up his quarrels with Laura Lou by bringing her presents..." and his impulse seemed to lose its spontaneity.</p>

<p>"But, Vance, I didn't want a present--." Seeing his look of
disappointment she regretted the words. "Oh, but this is lovely,"
she hurried on, slipping through her fingers an old peasant
necklace of garnets and enamelled gold. She remembered having
admired it one day in an antiquary's shop. "I didn't even know
you knew I'd seen it," she said, her voice shaken by the
returning rush of happiness.</p>

<p>"I didn't. Alders told me; he notices those things more than I
do," said Vance with simplicity.</p>

<p>Halo's heart dropped. She looked at the necklace with
disenchanted eyes. Then she thought: "If he tells me the truth
it's because he still loves me, and doesn't feel that he has to
pretend"; and she slipped the trinket about her neck. Vance
looked at her earnestly. "You really like it?"</p>

<p>"I love it--but you've been very extravagant, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>He laughed and shook his head. "Call it a wedding
present."</p>

<p>Halo echoed the laugh. "A wedding present? Oh, please not,
darling; because I want to wear it at once!"</p>

<p>"Well, you won't have to wait long, will you? Can't we get
married pretty soon now?" Vance looked at her shyly, as though
making the offer to a young girl he secretly worshipped, but was
afraid of frightening by a too impulsive word.</p>

<p>Halo saw that he was trying to reassure her, to convince her
of his love; he had trembled for their future as she had. For a
moment she found no words; then they came, quick and passionate.
"No, no! Don't let's talk of that now. It won't be soon, at any
rate; my divorce, I mean; probably not for a long time--I don't
care if I never get it. Nothing can be as perfect as this. If
there's any way of being happier, I don't want to know it--it
would frighten me! In heaven there's no marrying or giving in
marriage. Let's stay in heaven as long as we can." She went up to
him and found the safety of his arms.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Their second honeymoon had the factitious fervour which marks
such reconstructions. Halo had grown afraid to take her happiness
for granted, and afraid lest Vance should detect her fears. The
simplest words they exchanged seemed to connote a background of
artifice. There were times when the effort to be careless and
buoyant made her feel old and wary; others when the perfection of
the present filled her with a new dread of the future. There was
hardly an hour when she could yield without afterthought to the
natural joy she had known during her first weeks with her
lover.</p>

<p>She had hesitated for a long time before answering the letter
her lawyer had sent to the steamer; now she wrote briefly,
thanking him for his advice, but saying that the affair must take
its course. For her part she would not attempt to interfere. She
was travelling abroad with Vance Weston, as her husband could
easily assure himself, and he was at liberty to divorce her if he
preferred a scandal, and was unwilling to let her have her
liberty without it. To her mother, from whom she had received
several letters full of distressful entreaties, she wrote in the
same strain. "Dearest, dearest, do try to understand me, and be
patient with me if you can't. I love Vance, I believe in his
genius, I went to him because he was lonely and unhappy and
needed me, and I mean to stay with him as long as he wants me. If
Lewis won't let me have my divorce on the terms we had agreed on
he can easily get all the evidence he needs and take proceedings
against me. But if he would rather forego his freedom than give
me mine, even on those conditions, his decision can make no
difference to me, for I shall be proud to live with Vance as his
mistress. Nothing that Lewis does can really hurt me, and it
seems a pity he should sacrifice his own happiness when he is so
powerless to interfere with mine."</p>

<p>The words, as she re-read them, sounded rather theatrical, and
she would have preferred to avoid such a declaration of
independence; but it had the advantage of defining her situation,
and cutting off her retreat. She would have liked to show the two
letters to Vance, but she refrained lest he should think she was
trying to remind him of what she had given up for him. Such a
reminder might seem like a claim, and in her heart she was afraid
to make it; yet an instant later she thought: "Whatever happens,
I must keep him now," and seeing in a flash the desert distances
of life without him she forgot her magnanimous resolve to respect
his freedom.</p>

<p>To Vance, it was obvious, the whole episode had been less
important. He had never even asked her how she knew she would not
be able to obtain her freedom immediately; the question of
divorce and marriage seemed to have dropped out of his mind. "He
takes what I say so literally," she reflected, "that I daresay he
thinks I really don't care about it"; yet the possibility that he
might think so was a surprise to her. But no doubt he had had
many lovers' quarrels with Laura Lou, perhaps with other women of
her type, and was used to pacifying them with a kiss and a
present. Probably he regarded such incidents as inevitable
interruptions to his work, and had learned to dismiss them from
his mind as soon as they were over...Ah, if only he were
working now! If she could have seen any returning impulse of
activity, any trace of that impatience to express himself which
had been his torment and rapture when she had first known him,
how eagerly she would have banished her anxieties, how jealously
she would have defended his privacy! The hours he spent away from
her were not spent in solitary toil, but in dreaming and
dawdling, or in long discursive sessions with Alders at
restaurants and caf&eacute;s. She made a fresh effort to conceal
her dislike of Alders, and he sometimes came up to the pension to
dine, and went with them afterward to the tawdry dances in the
gypsy quarter, or to concerts of local music in the caf&eacute;s.
But Alders was never wholly at his ease with her, and was
therefore less entertaining to Vance than when the two were
alone. "He gets all wooden when you're around. I guess he's
woman-shy. I can see he doesn't amuse you," Vance commented
unconcernedly. Halo understood the reason; she saw that Alders
knew she had taken his measure, and that he ascribed her lack of
cordiality to his not being exactly in her class. To Alders, the
victim of unsatisfied social cravings, she was the fashionable
woman in whose company he was not at ease; whereas Vance, for
whom social distinctions did not exist, felt no constraint in her
presence because to him she was as different from every one else
as a nymph or an angel. And after two or three evenings of heat
and noise and bad tobacco in the sham underworld of gypsies and
guitarists she let Vance rejoin his friend without her.</p>

<p>There was no physical jealousy in the irritation which his
absences caused her. As a woman she was still sure of her hold;
as a comrade and guide she felt herself superseded. When he began
to work again he might still need her as audience and critic; but
meanwhile his restless mind was always straying from her. He had
begun to learn Spanish, and this was the only task he had
persisted in. His insatiable intellectual curiosity made him
chafe at the obstacle of a strange language; and tramping the
streets with Alders was a quicker method of learning than
reciting conjugations to a snuffy professor. Meanwhile, with the
beginning of the autumn rains, their rooms had become too cold
and damp, and they began to look about for others. But one
morning Vance abruptly announced that he wanted to go for a
couple of months to some sea-port in the south--say Malaga or
Cadiz--where he could settle down to his new book in the proper
environment.</p>

<p>"Your new book?" Halo echoed, eagerly.</p>

<p>Yes, he said; he was beginning to want to get to work again.
And he ought to know something about life in a Spanish trading
port if he was to situate his story there, oughtn't he--the story
of the young American sent over from Boston or Salem in the
eighteen thirties, to learn the wine business in Spain: the
subject Alders had first suggested. He'd been thinking it over a
good deal lately, and gradually it had taken hold of him. He
liked the idea of a heroine who could be called <i>Pilar</i>--she
was to look like that little Virgin with the pear-shaped face
that they'd seen at Cordova. Well--hadn't Halo anything to say to
the idea? he broke off, as she continued to listen in
silence.</p>

<p>"I thought you meant to go on with 'Magic'," she said at
length.</p>

<p>"Well, so I did--but now I don't. I don't suppose it's any use
trying to make you see..."</p>

<p>"I think I see. It's perfectly natural that new scenes should
suggest new subjects."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a smile of relief. "I'm glad you feel
that--"</p>

<p>"Only you said you'd never do another story like 'Instead'--a
'costume piece', I mean. I thought you were determined not to go
back to that, but always to do contemporary subjects."</p>

<p>"Oh, these 'neverses' and 'alwayses'! Who was the gent who
talked about some word or other not being in the lexicon of
youth? I'm sure the lexicon of art has no hard-and-fast words in
it like always and never. I do what I'm moved to do; any artist,
even the greatest of 'em, will tell you it's all he <i>can</i>
do. It's the eternal limitation...See here, Halo, I didn't
mean to bother you again with this kind of talk. Nobody but a
writer can understand--but you must trust me to know what I'm
after; what I'm driven after, as it were."</p>

<p>She recognized the Alders vocabulary, and said with a slight
shrug: "What I do understand is that it will do you good to get
to work again."</p>

<p>Instantly his eyes darkened. "Ah, that's it! You're
disappointed in me--you think I've just been losing my time all
these months?"</p>

<p>"We shall be able to judge of that better when you begin to
write again," she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"All right, then. What do you say to Cadiz? The climate's
better there, isn't it? Or I might call her Concepcion,
perhaps--that's even funnier, if she's to be married to a Puritan
from Salem. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>Halo hesitated. She had meant, when they left Granada, to
propose that they should go to Florence or Rome for the winter.
She felt that Vance needed the stimulus of a cultivated society;
she would have suggested Paris if their situation had not made it
embarrassing for her to settle down in a city where, at every
turn, she was sure to run across friends and acquaintances. Until
the matter of the divorce was settled in one way or another she
preferred to avoid such encounters. But now she decided that she
must let him have his way, lest he should feel that, at the very
moment when his writing mood returned, she had needlessly
interfered with it. "By all means, let's try Cadiz," she
agreed.</p>

<p>"But you don't believe in my idea for the new novel?"</p>

<p>"I believe in your trying it out, at any rate."</p>

<p>"You're a great girl, Halo," he said joyously. "I love the way
you look when you hate a thing, and think you can persuade people
that you like it."</p>

<p>It was on the tip of her tongue to answer: "I suppose you mean
the way I look at Alders--" but she refrained, and merely said
with a laugh: "It's the first principle of every woman's job."
Inwardly, she was wondering what had made Vance suddenly decide
to go to Cadiz. She felt sure that Alders had suggested the
change, and that he had his own reasons for wishing to exchange
Granada for the south. But the next day Vance asked her if she
would mind if Alders came up to say goodbye. She minded so little
that she had to bear in mind Vance's remark on her inability to
conceal her feelings. "Goodbye? Oh, Alders is off too, is he?
Yes, of course I'll see him." But she still felt that, unless
Alders had found some one else to prey on conversationally, this
leave-taking was probably only a feint.</p>

<p>Alders appeared punctually, and overcame his shyness
sufficiently to thank her for her kindness, and mumble something
about its being a privilege he would never forget. She was on the
point of asking him if he would not be turning up later at Cadiz;
but she refrained lest he should act on the suggestion, and
merely remarked that she supposed he thought the time for leaving
Spain had come.</p>

<p>"No, not leaving Spain; I don't expect to do that for some
time. Only leaving Granada." With increased timidity he explained
that he was joining a big shooting party in Estremadura--rather a
romantic sort of affair, as they were to stay in a fortified
castle among the mountains, a place belonging to the old
Marquesa. Her sons had organized the party in honour of a young
cousin from Palermo who had come to Spain for the first time, to
visit the Marquesa; and as he didn't know a word of Spanish, and
as Alders spoke Italian, the latter had been invited to join the
expedition--"in the character of interpreter," Alders added, with
a fresh access of modesty which manifestly invited
contradiction.</p>

<p>"The poor young man--what a blessing for him to find somebody
he can talk to!" Halo said cordially; and Vance added: "And
somebody who knows the country inside out, like Alders."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's very much on the spot; he'll make his own
discoveries. But it will be amusing to do what I can. As a
collector of human antiquities, these great heraldic names always
appeal to me." Alders addressed himself to Halo: "I once planned
out a book on the relation between heraldry and religious
symbolism. Take the Babylonian Fish God, for instance, who
figures in the Zodiac, and then in the Roman catacombs as the
sacred emblem of the Christ...and finally as the <i>armes
parlantes</i> of some great medi&aelig;val family. I am sure you
will recall which, Mrs. Weston? The idea is not without interest...But
you've so many friends in European society," Alders broke
off. "Very likely you know the Marquesa's cousin. It's a great
name in Calabria...there's a cousinship with the Spanish
Bourbons." He waited long enough to enjoy the taste of his own
words, and to let Halo enquire the name. "The Duke of
Spartivento," he replied devoutly.</p>

<p>After Alders had taken his leave, Vance sat indolently
swinging his legs in the window-seat, while Halo returned to the
task of sorting their books and gathering up the odds and ends
which had accumulated in their little sitting-room. They had
engaged places in the motor-coach for Cadiz, and both were full
of the happy excitement of departure.</p>

<p>"What was that he called his new friend?" Vance mused. "It
sounded like a thunderclap."</p>

<p>"Spartivento."</p>

<p>"Well, that's some name. What does it mean? Windjammer, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"More like wind-divider, I should say. It's the name of a big
promontory off the coast of Southern Italy or Sicily. Calabria,
probably, as the family come from there."</p>

<p>"Why, are there real people called that? I had an idea Alders
had made it all up. He gets word-drunk, sometimes."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Not this time. It's really one of the titles of an
old Italian family. I've often heard of them."</p>

<p>Vance lapsed into a marvelling silence until Halo, looking up
from her work, abruptly accused him of having spirited away
Ford's "Gatherings in Spain". But he merely declared that he knew
where the book was, and stood staring at her with visionary eyes.
"What a name! What a name! It sounds like that poem of
Christopher Smart's, with every line beginning 'Glorious'. I
should hate to have to live up to it, though, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Halo, absorbed in her task, replied absently that very likely
the owner didn't; and Vance continued to murmur:
"Spartivento--Spartivento: the wind-divider. Dividing the winds.
Why, that's what genius ought to do, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Genius," Halo replied gaily, "ought first of all to find me
'Gatherings in Spain'."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On a day of the following September Vance Weston was walking
down the Boulevard Montparnasse.</p>

<p>He seemed to himself a totally different being from the young
ignoramus who had left New York with Halo Tarrant a year
previously. To begin with, he was the author of a second
successful novel. "The Puritan in Spain", dashed off in a rush of
inspiration during the previous autumn and winter, had come out
in the spring, and attained immediate popularity. It was a vivid
tale, sultry and savage as the Spanish landscape--so one reviewer
said. Another compared it with "Carmen", to
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's disadvantage; and a third declared that
it combined the psychological insight of Tchekov with the sombre
fatalism of Emily Bront&euml;.</p>

<p>Vance did not wholly share these views. The thing had come too
easily; he knew it had not been fetched up out of the depths.
When he was among friends and admirers, with the warm breeze of
adulation blowing through him, he remembered that greater
geniuses had suffered from the same dissatisfaction, and his
disbelief in his book grew more intermittent. But when he was
alone he recalled the passionate groping conviction with which he
had written "Instead", and the beginning of the unfinished novel,
"Magic", and the feeling returned that those two books had been
made out of his inmost substance, while the new one sprang from
its surface. "The Puritan in Spain" was better written and more
adroitly composed than its predecessors; there were
scenes--little Pilar's death, or young Ralston's return to
Salem--that Vance could not re-read without a certain pleasure.
These scenes had assuredly been written with the same conviction
as those in the earlier books; yet now he felt only their
superior craft. One half of him was proud of the book, and
believed all that his readers said in praise of it; but the other
half winced at their praise. "What's the use of doing anything
really big? If ever I do, nobody'll read it...Well, and what
if they don't? Who am I writing for, anyhow? Only the Mothers!"
he thought savagely.</p>

<p>He swung along down the Boulevard Montparnasse and the
Boulevard Raspail to the Seine. The sight of moving waters always
arrested him, and he leaned on the parapet and watched the breeze
crisp the river. The sun-flecks on the water mimicked the
yellowing leaves of the trees along the banks, and streets and
river were dappled with the same gold. Vance felt young and
happy, and full of power. "Wait till I get my teeth into the
next--" he thought, his joyous eyes on the river, the boats, the
bridges, the gray palaces seen through fading trees. He would
have liked to spend the rest of his life in that setting of
foliage and buildings; yet he was beginning to feel that he would
never get to work while he remained in Paris. "The Puritan in
Spain" had been written in three months at Cadiz, in solitude and
monotony--for the life there, alone with Halo, had been
desperately monotonous. They knew no one; his friend Alders had
vanished, and Vance had made no new acquaintances. He had
imagined that once he was at work Halo's presence would be the
only stimulus he needed; and no doubt it was, since the book had
been written. But he had not felt her imagination flaming through
him as it had when they used to meet at the Willows. The
dampening effect of habit seemed to have extinguished that flame.
She listened intelligently, but she no longer collaborated; and
now that the book was done he knew she did not care for it.
Perhaps that was the real source of his dissatisfaction; he told
himself irritably that he was still too subject to her
judgments.</p>

<p>During their first months together he and she had lived in a
deep spiritual isolation; at times they seemed too close to each
other, seemed to be pressing on each other, pinning down each
other's souls. With the first intrusion from the outside, with
the appearance of his queer friend Alders, from being too near
they had suddenly become too far apart, at times almost out of
sight; and since Alders had left them, and they had gone to
Cadiz, there had been something strained and self-conscious in
their relation, delicious though certain moments were.</p>

<p>His book finished, Vance was in a fever to get away, not only
from Cadiz but from Spain; and Halo, after suggesting that they
should end the winter in Italy, agreed that Paris might be best.
She seemed to understand that after their months of solitude he
needed the stimulus of a great city, the contact with conflicting
views and ideas. He did not have to tell her--one never had to
explain things to her. At first she had hesitated when he
mentioned Paris, and he remembered her outbreak of resentment at
not being invited to the old Marquesa's, and was reminded that
she was sensitive about meeting strangers to whom her situation
had to be explained; but when he asked her if she would rather go
to some quiet place where they needn't bother with people she
said she didn't see why they should have to do with people who
bothered them. Now that the book was done, she added, he ought to
go about again, and see something of the literary world; and so
they decided on Paris.</p>

<p>Halo, almost at once, found a little flat with a studio, in a
shabby friendly house near the Luxembourg; and her brother Lorry
Spear, who had been living for some years in Paris, helped the
pair to settle down, and introduced them to his friends. Vance
had last seen Lorry Spear on the day when the latter had borrowed
ten dollars of him. Lorry had never returned the ten dollars, and
had figured mysteriously in a far more painful episode. Some
valuable books had disappeared from the library of the Willows,
which then belonged to old Mr. Tom Lorburn, Mrs. Spear's cousin,
and Mr. Lorburn had suspected Vance of stealing and selling them.
They had eventually been found at a second-hand bookseller's, and
brought back (it was whispered) by Lewis Tarrant; and no more was
said, or suggested, as to Vance's connection with the incident.
But Vance knew, and so did Halo, that Lorry Spear had been the
last person in the library of the Willows before the books
vanished, and that he had been there alone.</p>

<p>This had left an unpleasant taste in Vance's mouth; but he had
travelled too far from the raw boy of those days to be much
affected by what concerned him; and like everything which did not
strike to the quick, the affair had faded from his mind. Moreover
he knew that Halo was fond of her brother, though aware of his
weaknesses, and that she was glad to be near him again.</p>

<p>Life in Paris had roused in Vance a thousand new curiosities
and activities. So far he had chiefly frequented the young men
and women who met at the literary caf&eacute;s of Montparnasse,
and at the studios of the painters and decorators of the same
group. In this world Lorry Spear was an important figure. He had
made a successful start as a theatrical designer (also, it was
rumoured, with Tarrant's aid) and his big studio in the painters'
quarter off the Boulevard Raspail was the centre of an advanced
group of artists and writers. A young woman with violently red
hair and sharp cheek-bones presided over it when she could spare
the time from a mysterious bookshop in the Latin Quarter, which
she and a girl friend managed. The red-haired young lady, whose
real name was Violet Southernwood, had been re-christened Jane
Meggs when she threw in her lot with Lorry, who declared himself
unable to endure the sound of so nauseatingly pretty a name. "A
flower and a tree--southernwood's a shrub, isn't it? Well,
anyway, I don't want anybody around here who smells of nature to
that extent. And I should have had to call myself Mossy Stone,
which would--what? Oh, well, Jane don't mind a joke, do you, my
own?"</p>

<p>Miss Meggs said what nauseated <i>her</i> was having to
associate with anybody who got his jokes out of Wordsworth; but
Lorry replied that Wordsworth was the author of some of the most
virulently hideous lines in English poetry, and would soon be
recognized as the Laureate of the new school of the
Ugly-for-the-Ugly--"which is all ye need to know," he ended,
while Miss Meggs groaned: "Lord--and he's read Keats too!"</p>

<p>Such pleasantries were too reminiscent of the Cocoanut Tree,
and Rebecca Stram's studio, where Vance had picked up his first
smattering of the new culture, and he preferred Alders's
second-rate learning to this wholesale rejection of the past. But
the group contained other elements. Among the young men, would-be
writers and painters, who laughed at Lorry's oracles, and idled
away the hours capping each other's paradoxes, there were a few,
French or English, who had joined the circle out of curiosity,
and the exuberance of youth, but had already taken its measure.
With two or three of them Vance and Halo had at once made
friends, and founded a little circle of their own. These young
men all professed the philosophic nihilism which was the creed of
their group; but they were scholarly, analytical, intellectually
curious and the cheap fireworks of Lorry's followers no longer
satisfied them. What interested Vance, however, was less the
nature of their views than the temper of their minds. He felt in
all of them the fine edge of a trained intelligence--the quality
he had always groped for without knowing what to call it or how
to acquire it. Now, wherever he went, he seemed to meet it; as
though it were as much a part of Paris as the stately
architecture, the beauty of streets and river, and the sense of
that other accumulated beauty stored behind museum walls. All
through this great visual symphony he felt the fine vibrations of
intelligence, the activity of high-strung minds. The young men
who sat the night through talking with him were but obscure
participants in this vast orchestration; but its rumour was
always behind their talk. At first the life satisfied all Vance's
needs. To look and listen and question was as stimulating as
creation. Then, as always happened, he began to feel the need of
setting his mind to work on the new material he had amassed, away
from the excitement of discussion. This rhythmic recurrence of
moods seemed to be a law of his nature, but he did not know how
to formulate it to himself, still less to make it clear to Halo.
It seemed hopeless to try to explain his sudden impulses of
flight from everything that was delighting his imagination and
expanding his mind. As he leaned on the parapet in the September
sunshine he was thinking of this, not irritably or even
impatiently, but with a sort of philosophic detachment. Communion
with Halo had once been the completion of his dreams; now, when
his thoughts took flight, she was the obstacle that arrested
them. When he thought of her he felt almost as hopeless of
explaining himself as he had with Laura Lou. She, who was alive
and vibrating at so many points, failed to feel the rhythm of his
inner life. Everything on the surface of his intelligence she
instantly caught up and flashed back; he could laugh and talk
with her by the hour in the freedom of perfect understanding. But
of the forces stored in him during his solitary wanderings, and
his talks with this group of young men, she guessed nothing,
perceived nothing; and to this he had made up his mind without
any feeling of loneliness or resentment. He was beginning to
discover that he no longer needed a companion in these
explorations of the depths; what he most wanted then was to be
alone.</p>

<p>Now and then he and Halo went off for a weekend, to see some
of the wonderful places she had told him about. The first time
Vance was alight with fervour and curiosity. They had chosen
Senlis, and loitered all day around its ramparts, in its ancient
streets, and on the wall overlooking the mossy golden flanks of
the cathedral tower. Then they went down into the square before
the west front of the cathedral, and stood gazing at the death of
the Virgin over the west portal, and at the saints and prophets
poised among the delicate grasses and lichens of the cornice.
Vance was in the state of receptiveness into which great
impressions steal like angels. If he had been alone, and had not
had to tell Halo how beautiful he thought it, his well-being
would have been complete.</p>

<p>The experiment was so successful that Halo was eager to repeat
it; and soon afterward they went to Chartres. She had decided
that they must spend the night there, so that Vance should see
the cathedral in all its aspects, at dusk, at sunrise, under the
stars, and when noonday jewelled its windows; she gave him the
impression that they were going on a kind of spiritual honeymoon.
It was unlucky that the day before he had been seized by the
desire to plan a new book, and was in that state of inward
brooding when the visible world becomes a blank; but Chartres was
Chartres, the treasury of visions and emotions, the fountain of
poetry and dreams...He only wished he hadn't read and heard so
much about it...</p>

<p>And then, when at last he was face to face with the cathedral,
he couldn't see it. He stood there, a little lump of humanity,
confronting a great lump of masonry; that was as far as he could
get. All the overwhelmingness left him standing in front of it,
open-eyed and utterly insensible. Halo led him from one
fa&ccedil;ade to the other, and at each halt he felt her watching
him in tender expectancy. At last they went in, and walked slowly
about that vast luminous world--and still he felt nothing, saw
nothing. A band of trippers dragged by, deaf and vacant-eyed, a
guide buzzing about them with dates and statistics. Halo gave
them a contemptuous glance; but Vance thought: "They feel the way
I do." Halo was elaborately tactful; she waited; she kept silent;
she left him to his emotions; but no emotions came. He almost
wished she would scream out: "Well, aren't you going to say
<i>something</i>?"--and he thought despairingly: "When will it be
over?"</p>

<p>They went to a little tea-shop and had tea (thank God!), and
came back and saw twilight fall on towers and buttresses, and
dusk deepen to night under the sculpture of the porches. They
dined, and came back to see the blueish-gray mass shimmering
gigantic under the stars. Then they wandered through the streets
and stopped at a caf&eacute; for a glass of vermouth. Vance felt
that he would soon have to say something, and he would have given
the world to slip away before Halo spoke. "Well, dearest--?"</p>

<p>He emptied his glass, and stared sullenly into it. "Well, I
just don't see it."</p>

<p>"Don't <i>see</i> it?"</p>

<p>"Not a glimmer; not of what you expect me to...It's not my
size, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not your size?" Halo echoed, in the tone of one who has
fitted Chartres into her cosmogony without an effort.</p>

<p>Vance felt the inadequacy of words. "I don't <i>see</i> it, I
tell you. I don't care for it. There's too much of it; yet there
isn't anything in it--not for me."</p>

<p>Halo stood up and slipped her arm in his. "You're simply
overwhelmed by it--as you were that first evening at Cordova. I
was like that when I came here the first time; but tomorrow..."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I don't want to wait till tomorrow. I want to go home
now. Can't we--isn't there a night train? There's sure to be one..."</p>

<p>He would have liked to tell her that his mind was full of his
new book, passionately grappling with its subject. If he had, she
would have been full of sympathy and understanding; but he did
not want sympathy and understanding. He felt sulky and baffled,
and wanted to remain so. The masculine longing to be left alone
was upper most; he wanted to hate Chartres without having to give
any reason.</p>

<p>"It's not my size," he repeated obstinately.</p>

<p>He saw the immensity of her disappointment. "I know--I'm a
Yahoo. But let's go home," he pleaded. They caught a train, and
got back to Paris, tired and heavy-eyed, at daylight; and for
some time Halo proposed no more week-ends.</p>

<p>But one afternoon, a month later, he went off with two of the
young men he had met at Lorry Spear's--a young English painter
named Arthur Tolby, and Savignac, a French literary critic. They
were not in pursuit of sights; both his companions knew the
environs of Paris well enough to take them for granted. But they
knew of an inn, fifty miles away, where the food was good enough
to satisfy the Frenchman, and there was a chance of trout-fishing
for Vance and Tolby. They started in Tolby's rattling motor,
hours later than the time appointed, and toward sunset came to a
town of which Vance was too lazy to ask the name. As they reached
it, a sudden thunderstorm rolled up and burst above them. The sky
was black, the roads became riverbeds. They decided to wait till
the worst of the deluge was over, and Tolby took his car to a
garage for a little tinkering. The young men dropped Vance under
the porch of a church, and he went in to get shelter. His
thoughts were all tangled up in his new novel--a big unwieldy
subject full of difficulty and fascination. When he entered the
church in this unknown town his eyes were closed to the outer
world; he simply wanted to take refuge from the weather. The
church was empty, immense, and dark as night. There was a cluster
of candles before a distant shrine, but the nave and aisles were
unlit, and the thunder-cloud hung its pall before the windows.
Vance sat down, and was listening absently to the roar of the
storm when a flash illuminated the walls of glass, and celestial
fields of azure and rose suddenly embowered him. In another
instant all was dark, as if obliterated by the thunder following
the flash; then the incandescence began again--a flowering of
magical sky-gardens in which every heavenly hue blossomed against
a blue as dazzling as sunlight; and after each flowering came
extinction.</p>

<p>Vance sat among these bursts of glory and passages of darkness
as if alternate cantos of the Paradiso and the Inferno were
whirling through him. At length his friends came, they scrambled
into the motor, and he left the vision behind. To his companions
he said no word of it; he did not even ask the name of the town.
They reached their destination late, and sat half the night in
the inn garden, watching the moon on a placid river, and talking
about the new experiments in painting and literature, about
Eddington and Whitehead, Pure Poetry and Thomism, and the best
trout-flies for the stream they were to fish...</p>

<p>These memories flowed through Vance's mind as he sat on the
parapet looking across the Seine. His months in Paris had been
rich in experience; if his receptivity sometimes failed him when
Halo had most counted on it, he had secreted treasures
unsuspected by her, such as the sights and sounds of the river,
or that fragment of heaven torn from the storm in the unknown
church. Surcharged and happy, he got up and strolled on.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c09">IX</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo Tarrant, when she and Vance decided to come to Paris, had
looked forward to the adventure with dread. Free love, she found,
was not the simple experiment she had imagined. The coast of
Bohemia might be pleasant to land on for a picnic, yet the
interior of the country prove disappointing. She had fancied that
in the tolerant air of her brother's studio she would shake off
this feeling. She knew it was not based on moral scruples
(morally speaking the business was still a labyrinth to her) but
on a sort of inherited dislike of being unclassified, and out of
the social picture. The social picture, as understood in the
Lorburn tradition, had never existed for Lorry; or so he had led
his sister to suppose. It had probably never occurred to him to
marry Miss Jane Meggs, or to Miss Meggs to expect or wish that he
should. Almost all the young men of the group stood in the same
unfettered relation to one or more young women; and the few
married couples among them tried to excuse their inferior state
by the show of a larger liberty.</p>

<p>Among such people, Halo told herself, she would certainly lose
the last of her old prejudices. After the cramping hypocrisy of
her life with Lewis Tarrant it would be refreshing to be among
people who laughed at the idea that there could be any valid tie
between young men and women except that of a passing attraction.
But from the first she had felt herself an outsider in this world
which was to set her free. She liked some of the people she met
at her brother's, she was amused and interested by nearly all of
them, and she tried to cultivate a friendly tolerance toward the
few she found least sympathetic. But she had dropped out of her
own picture without yet fitting into this one. Just as she
imagined herself to be growing happy and at home among those
harum-scarum people with their hysterical good-nature and their
verbal enormities, she became suddenly aware that her real self
was still ruled by other ideas, and that her new companions all
knew it. Beauty, order and reasonableness grew more and more dear
to her in the noisy anarchy of Lorry's circle, and the audacities
she risked, instead of making her new friends feel that she was
one of them, only caused them a vague embarrassment. She had
wanted Bohemianism on her own terms, as a momentary contrast to
convention; and finding its laws no less irksome than the others,
she bore them less philosophically because she did not believe in
them.</p>

<p>The delay about her divorce did not trouble her greatly. In
that easy-going world such matters seemed irrelevant, and she
smiled to think how bitterly she had resented Vance's going
without her to the party at Granada. Since then she had put away
childish things, and whether she and Vance married, or remained
as they were, seemed of no consequence compared to the one vital
point: would he weary of her, or would she be able to hold him?
Sometimes she thought that if they could be married before he
grew tired, their marriage might consolidate the bond. But in
Lorry's world it would have occurred to no one that marriage was
in itself more permanent than a casual love-affair; the new
generation argued that it was easier to separate if you were
married, since divorce formalities were easier than a sentimental
break.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she clung to the thought of marriage; and soon
after their arrival in Paris she wrote to ask her lawyer the
reason of the delay, and to repeat that, if Tarrant would not let
her divorce him, she hoped he would take proceedings against her
at once. The answer was not what she had expected. The lawyer
wrote that Tarrant no longer wished for a divorce. He not only
refused to take proceedings, but declined on any terms to set
Halo free. No reasons were given; but the lawyer was satisfied
that, for the present, any appeal against this decision would
only harden Tarrant's resolve. He advised Halo to wait, in the
hope that her husband's mood might change; and her knowledge of
Tarrant made her accept the advice.</p>

<p>From Frenside and her mother she learned soon afterward that
Tarrant's projected marriage with Mrs. Pulsifer was off, and she
suspected that this wound to his vanity had been the cause of his
sudden opposition.</p>

<p>This new obstacle was a blow to her; but she did not speak of
it to Vance. She had resolved not to make any allusion to their
marriage unless he raised the question; and since their talk at
Granada, when he had asked her about the delay in her divorce, he
seemed to have dismissed the matter from his mind. Probably it
made no difference to him if they were married or not; perhaps,
even, it was a relief to feel that the tie between them depended
only on their pleasure. Whatever happened, she could not tell
Vance about that letter...</p>

<p>There were moments when such questions weighed little in the
balance of her daily joys; but these joys became more necessary
because of what they had to replace. She had to love Vance more
passionately, and to believe in his genius more fervently and
continuously, because she had staked so much on her love and her
faith. Vance as a lover still filled her life with radiance, and
her tenderness grew with the sense of his eager longing to make
her happy; but it was in the region of thought and imagination
that she had dreamed of a lasting hold over him, and it was in
this region that she found herself least wanted.</p>

<p>She did not begrudge the hours he spent with his new friends.
Men with quick discerning minds, like Arthur Tolby and young
Savignac, interested her as much as they did Vance, and she was
proud of their appreciation of her lover. They would never have
encouraged him, as Alders had, to repeat himself by writing an
other novel like "Instead"--a "costume piece" which drew its
chief effects from a tricky use of local colour. Savignac had
told her privately what he thought of the book; it was ever so
pretty--ever so clever--but what business had a man of Weston's
quality to be doing novels like ladies' fancy-work, or an
expensive perfume? He ought to be tackling new difficulties, not
warming up old successes. Yes; Halo knew it all; she did not need
to have it pointed out, and there was a sting in the fact that
this clever young man thought that her affections blinded her, or
that her literary standards were less exacting than his. She had
always known that Alder's cheap enthusiasms were misleading
Vance; but her hints had been wasted. And now, after an evening
with his new friends, he could come back and say, quite
unconsciously: "Of course I know 'The Puritan' is just pretty
wall-paper--something pasted over the rough stuff of reality.
Tolby called it that yesterday. Not an ounce of flesh-and-blood
in it, not a breath of real air. Don't I know? Why didn't you
have the nerve to tell me so? A fellow gets balled up in his
subject, and doesn't see which way he's going. You might have
told me that I was just re-writing 'Instead' in a new
setting."</p>

<p>A year ago she could hardly have refrained from saying: "But,
darling, I did tell you, and you wouldn't listen!" She was too
wise for that now, and she merely replied: "I'm so glad you've
had these talks with Savignac and Tolby. A fresh eye is always
such a help--"</p>

<p>"Oh, I oughtn't to need any eye but my own," Vance grumbled
jealously: and she went away smiling to put on her newest hat for
an out-of-door dinner in the Bois. "The next book--the next
book," she thought, "will show them all what he really is." There
were times when she caught herself praying for that next book as
lonely wives pray for a child...</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>All this passed through her mind as she sat one afternoon in
her brother's studio, encumbered with half-finished
stage-settings and models of famous theatres, and waited for him
to come in. She envied Lorry the place he had made for himself in
the busy experimental world of the arts. From an idle and
troublesome youth he had turned into a hard-working man, absorbed
in his task, confident of his powers, and preoccupied only by the
eternal problem of getting money enough to execute his costly
schemes. The last of these, she knew, was a great musical
spectacle, to be expressed entirely in terms of modern
industrialism, with racing motors, aeroplanes and sub-marines as
the protagonists, prodigies of electric lighting, and stage
effects of unprecedented complication. For the present there was
little hope of carrying out this apocalyptic plan, and only the
providential appearance of a rich American with a craving to be
&aelig;sthetically up-to-date could make the dream come true.
Lorry, deserting his impecunious friends of Montparnasse, had
taken to haunting fashionable hotels and millionaire nightclubs;
but hitherto his possible patrons had shied away from his scheme,
and as Halo sat waiting she noticed that the stage-settings and
models for "Factories," which filled the working-table in the
middle of the room, were already gray with dust.</p>

<p>Waiting for Lorry was always an uncertain affair, but Halo
seldom had any engagements, and her unoccupied hours weighed on
her less heavily away from home. If any one had told her, a year
ago, that a young woman living with her lover in Paris could be
lonely, and find the time long, she would have smiled at the idea
as Vance did at her hints about his work; but now she had given
up trying to conceal the truth from herself. Before long,
perhaps, Vance would want to begin to write again, and then she
would be happy; but meanwhile even love and Paris were not
enough.</p>

<p>At last the door opened, and she heard Lorry's step. Luckily
he was alone, and they would be able to have a talk before the
afternoon crowd turned up. He came in whistling a negro
spiritual, said: "Hullo, child--you there?" and walked with an
absent eye toward the model of the last scene of "Factories". He
stood before it for a long time, passing from spirituals to the
latest <i>Revue</i> catch, and screwing up his eyes in
meditation. As his sister watched him she thought how changed he
was since he had found the job he was meant for. He would always
be unreliable about money, careless as to other people's
feelings, sweetly frivolous, gaily unfeeling; but where his work
was concerned he was a rock. He had found the right ballast for
his flighty nature, and would no doubt have said that the rest
didn't matter. Halo looked at him with envy.</p>

<p>"Lorry," she said, "can't you find me a job?"</p>

<p>He swung around and scrutinized her with those handsome ironic
eyes which were a shade too near together for security.</p>

<p>"A job? Why, I thought you had one! I thought you'd chucked
everything else for it."</p>

<p>She was on the point of answering, with a touch of bitterness:
"I thought so too--" but she checked herself.</p>

<p>"Don't be a goose! What I want is some sort of occupation
while Vance is working. I've never learnt to be lazy, and I feel
at a loose end, with all the rest of you absorbed in your village
industries. Why can't I have one too? Won't Jane take me on as an
apprentice in her book-shop?"</p>

<p>Lorry Spear pulled his hands out of his pockets and ceased his
whistling. "It's you who are the goose, my dear," he said. "When
are you going to get married?"</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise. It was the last question she
had expected; but she rejoined with a laugh: "Is that your idea
of an occupation?"</p>

<p>"For you, yes. A good deal more in your line than selling
censored books in Jane's back shop."</p>

<p>Halo coloured a little. "I didn't know you were so particular
about either literature or morals."</p>

<p>Lorry's face took on an expression of irritated severity.
"Hang it, I'm particular about everything--from my own point of
view. I like things to be in the pattern. Old Jane's in my
pattern--so are her books. Naturally a man feels differently
about his sister."</p>

<p>Halo was silent, and he continued, in his light sharp voice:
"I should have thought that as a mere matter of taste a woman
like you wouldn't want to be mixed up with the rabble that come
here. It's all right for a fugue--I'm all for a night off now and
then; but I don't suppose you're going to settle down among them,
as one of them, are you? Has it never occurred to you that it
leaves a bad taste in a man's mouth to have to introduce his
sister to the kind of women who come here? 'His sister? Who is
she? Oh, just one of us'. You can't hear them snicker; but I can.
If I haven't spoken till now it's because I expected, any day, to
hear that you and Weston were to be married."</p>

<p>Halo sat looking at her brother with growing astonishment. He
was aflame with one of the brief fits of self-righteousness which
used to seize him when he tried to borrow money, or to justify
some kind of doubtful transaction; but she wondered why he had
chosen her as a pretext.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; of course not," he pursued indignantly. "My feelings
are the last thing you ever think of--how a man likes it when he
knows the fellows he sees are saying behind his back: 'His
sister? Oh, anybody can have her the day her novelist chucks
her.' Look here, Halo, I've made myself a situation I'm proud of,
and here you come along and behave as if you wanted to do me all
the harm you can--as if you'd gone out of your way to offend our
family pride and ridicule our traditions! Of course if Weston had
any sense of what he owes you--"</p>

<p>Halo interrupted him with a laugh. "Really, Lorry, I suppose I
oughtn't to let you go on. But all those obsolete words sound so
funny in this atmosphere that I can't take them seriously; and I
don't believe you expect me to. I don't know that it's any of
your business to ask why I don't marry Vance--it's not a question
I expected to hear under this roof. As a matter of fact, I
suppose we shall marry when Lewis makes up his mind to let me
have my divorce; but such matters seem so secondary to any one as
blissfully happy as I am--"</p>

<p>Her brother gave an ironic shrug. "<i>You</i> blissfully
happy? Bless your heart--just go over and look at yourself in the
glass! You're better looking than ever, but your cheek-bones are
coming through your skin and your eyes look as if you'd tried to
rub out the circles under them with a dirty India rubber. And
then you talk to me about being happy!"</p>

<p>Halo shrank at the challenge, but met it with a laugh. "I
thought you liked ravaged beauties--I've been living on lemon
juice and raw carrots on purpose. But if you want to see me led
to the altar by my seducer you'd better persuade Lewis to let me
divorce him, or to get a divorce from me, if he prefers. When he
does, I daresay Vance and I will marry."</p>

<p>Lorry stood before her in an attitude of contemplation; at
last he said: "Look here, Halo--I hold no brief for Lewis, though
he did me a good turn once. But if a man agrees to let his wife
divorce him, I can understand his feeling that she might wait to
join her lover till she's got her decree."</p>

<p>"No doubt the principle is a good one. But in my case only one
thing counted. Vance wanted me; I had to go to him."</p>

<p>Lorry gave an impatient shrug. "That's so Ibsenish. Talk of
obsolete words! Your whole vocabulary is made up of them. What
was there to prevent your seeing your young friend on the quiet?"
He laid a half-friendly, half-rebuking hand on her shoulder. "My
poor old girl, when a lady's such a lady, all the night-life and
the adultery won't wipe out the damned spot...I'm sorry; but
you offend me &aelig;sthetically; you really do; and that's the
worst sin in my decalogue."</p>

<p>"What a picture, Lorry! It would be funny if you turned out to
be the most conventional member of our family."</p>

<p>"I'm the most everything of our family, my dear; haven't you
found that out? I push things to their logical conclusions, while
the rest of you live in a perpetual blur. That, I may add, is why
I don't marry and found a family."</p>

<p>"And why you enjoin me to?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. It's the safest way, for people who can't see
around the next corner. And you're one of them."</p>

<p>Halo sat staring down at the rough cement of the studio floor.
She felt suddenly weary of the effort of bandying chaff with her
brother. Weary of that, and of everything else. What he said had
taken the strength out of her. It was not the first time that she
had been struck by Lorry's penetration. No one could see more
clearly into human motives, or drive his argument home more
forcibly when it was worth his while. For some reason which
escaped her, it was worth his while now; but that did not arrest
her attention, for her mind was riveted on the image of herself
which his words evoked. She had no need to look in the glass; in
his description her secret anxieties were revealed to her,
feature by feature. It was true that she would never be at home
among these people whose way of living was not the result of
passion but of the mere quest for novelty. Contact with the
clever mocking young women who, like herself, were living with
their lovers, seemed to belittle her relation to Vance. When
everything which was sacred to her in that relation would have
appeared to them incomprehensible or ridiculous, how could she
ever imagine herself one of them? She had always felt a latent
repulsion for them: for the capable free-spoken Jane, with her
thriving trade in forbidden books and obscene drawings, for her
friend and business partner, Kate Brennan, whose conversation
echoed and parodied Jane's, and for all the other women of the
group, with their artistic and literary jargon, picked up from
the brilliant young men whose lives they shared, and their noisy
ostentation of emotions they seldom felt, and sins they probably
did not always commit. Halo stood up and looked about her, at the
stacked-up stage-settings, the dusty electrical and photographic
apparatuses, the hideous sub-human faces grimacing from futurist
canvases, the huge plaster group of two women evilly contorting
themselves against a background of theatrical posters. It had all
seemed so free and jolly and clever--and Lorry's words had
crumbled the whole show to dust.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm off," she said. "If Vance comes, tell him not to
wait for me."</p>

<p>Lorry seemed to feel a touch of compunction. "Oh, look here,
old girl--" he glanced at his watch a little nervously--"don't go
till I've built you up with a cocktail."</p>

<p>She shook her head with a smile. "I'm beyond cocktails. It's
this stuffy weather--I feel so lifeless. I'm going home to lie
down."</p>

<p>She detected a tinge of relief in his eyes as he followed her
toward the door. "So long, then, my dear. If Weston turns up I'll
send him back to smooth your pillow." He laid his hand on hers.
"See here, Halo; why don't you go home--really?" His eyes looked
into hers simply and kindly, as they used to when he and she were
children. She pressed his hand and went out without
answering.</p>

<p>The studio was at the back of an untidy walled enclosure,
encumbered with the materials of an adjoining carpenter's shop.
As Halo emerged into the street a glittering motor drove up and
stopped. The chauffeur, after a glance of doubt and disapproval,
jumped down to open the door, and there descended a heavily built
lady dressed with sober opulence. It was clearly unusual for her
to set foot to the ground in such a quarter, for she looked as
dubious and disapproving as the chauffeur. As she surveyed with
lifted nose and eye-glass the unpromising front of the
carpenter's shop, the rifts in the pavement, and the general
untidiness of the half built-up street, Halo thought: "New
York--and Park Avenue!" An instant later she identified the lady.
"Mrs. Glaisher! How fat she's grown. They all do, when they own
opera boxes and Rollses." She remembered Mrs. Glaisher as one of
the chief ornaments of the old expensive New York group which her
parents had belonged to and broken away from. Mrs. Glaisher was a
necessary evil. Once in the winter one had to hear Tristan or the
Rosenkavalier from her opera box, and once to dine off gold plate
in her Gothic refectory. But for the rest of the year she was the
object of proverbial pleasantry among the clever people who met
at Mrs. Spear's. What on earth could she be doing here now? Why,
probably looking for Lorry! The thought interested Halo, but did
not surprise her; she knew that Mrs. Glaisher was always panting
and puffing after what she called "the latest thing". Perhaps she
had just discovered Lorry; perhaps--very possibly--it was she on
whom he was counting to finance the costly stage-setting of
"Factories". The idea was so amusing that Halo forgot her own
troubles, and decided that she would guide Mrs. Glaisher to the
studio for the pleasure of hearing what she and Lorry had to say
to each other. Halo had a high idea of Lorry's verbal arts, and
he would need them all to bridge the distance between Mrs.
Glaisher's extremest mental effort and the most elementary
explanation of "Factories".</p>

<p>Mrs. Glaisher still wavered, as if seeking guidance.
Simultaneously, the two women moved a few steps toward each
other; then Mrs. Glaisher, pausing, appeared to absorb Halo's
presence into her eye-glasses, to turn it over and reject it.
After one deadly glance of recognition she averted her gaze, and
walked on as if there were no one in her path, and Halo, from the
street, was left to contemplate her broad and disapproving back.
She had been cut, distinctly and definitely cut, by Mrs.
Glaisher.</p>

<p>The idea was so new that she burst into a laugh. She caught an
expression of surprise on the chauffeur's disdainful face, and
then--could it be?--a fleeting but unconcealable grin. Mrs.
Glaisher's chauffeur was joining her in her laugh at Mrs.
Glaisher.</p>

<p>"But it's all New York that has cut me!" she chuckled to
herself; for she knew that every act and attitude of Mrs.
Glaisher's was the outcome of a prolonged and conscientious study
of what her particular world approved and disapproved of. The
idea of being excluded, ruled out, literally thought out of
existence, by all those towering sky-scrapers to whose shelter
the statue of Liberty so falsely invites the proscribed and the
persecuted, filled Halo with uncontrollable mirth, and she sped
homeward cheerfully humming: "I've been cut by Mrs.
Glaisher--Mrs. Glaisher--Mrs. Glaisher..."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c10">X</a></h1>

<p> </p>

<p>As she unlocked her door Halo heard animated talk in the
studio. The voices were Savignac's and Tolby's; they were
speaking with great vivacity, as if the subject under discussion
provoked curiosity and amusement. Still humming to herself: "I've
been cut by Mrs. Glaisher--Mrs. Glaisher--" Halo thought: "How I
shall make Vance laugh over it!" and she tried to catch his voice
among the others. But if he were there he was doubtless listening
in silence, stretched out on the brown Bokhara of the divan, his
arms folded under his head, and watching between half-shut lids
his cigarette smoke spiral upward. "Shall I tell him before the
others?" she thought, with an impulse of bravado.</p>

<p>"Well--!" she cried out gaily from the threshold. Only Tolby
and Savignac were there; as she turned the door-handle they
ceased talking and her "Well!" rang out in the silence. Savignac
rose, and Tolby, who was bending over the fire, continued to poke
it. "They were talking of me!" she thought, and Lorry's phrase
flashed through her mind: "The fellows are saying to themselves:
'His sister? Oh, anybody can have her the day her novelist chucks
her'."</p>

<p>That was what these young men, whom she liked, and who were
sitting over her fire waiting for her to come in, were probably
saying. If not, why should they stop talking so suddenly, and
lift such embarrassed faces? It had been very comic to be cut by
Mrs. Glaisher; it seemed to put things in their right
perspective, and rid Halo of her last scruples. But the idea that
her lover's friends had fallen silent on her entrance because
they had been caught discussing her situation did not strike her
as comic, and she felt a sudden childish ache to be back in the
accustomed frame-work of her life.</p>

<p>She came in and shook hands with the young men. "What have you
done with Vance?" she asked lightly.</p>

<p>Tolby gave a laugh. "Why, we were talking about him--if that's
what you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh--about <i>Vance</i>?" In her relief she could not help
stressing the name. "Is that why you both look so guilty?"</p>

<p>Tolby laughed again, and Savignac rejoined: "Yes, it is. But
for my part I'm going to confess. I don't like his book--at least
not as much as I want to."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you don't. And Tolby doesn't either. But he had
the courage to tell me so." Inwardly Halo was thinking: "What an
idiot I am! As if these young fellows cared whether Vance and I
are married or not! They know we love each other, and for them
that's all that counts. These are the kind of people I want to
live among." She sat down by the fire, and said: "One of you
might find the cocktail shaker. I'm too lazy."</p>

<p>Tolby made the necessary effort, and while they sipped, and
lit their cigarettes, Halo continued gaily: "But, you know, Vance
doesn't really care for the Spanish novel himself. Has he shown
you 'Magic', the one he began two years ago?"</p>

<p>"No," Tolby rejoined. "He said it was no use showing it
because it was definitely discarded; but last night at Savignac's
he read us an outline of this big new thing he's planning. Derek
Fane, of the 'Amplifier', was there, and Weston wanted his
opinion. That's the book we were talking about."</p>

<p>"Oh--" Halo murmured. There was a big new book, then; and
Vance hadn't yet seen fit to speak to her about it, much less to
read her the outline with which the young English critic had been
favoured. Why did he no longer talk to her about his work? The
idea that it must be her fault made her spirits droop again; but
she thought: "I mustn't let them see that I haven't heard of it."
She leaned back and puffed at her cigarette. "Well--how does it
strike you?"</p>

<p>Tolby gave a shrug. "Not my job--I'm no critic."</p>

<p>Halo laughed. "Savignac can't get out of it on that
pretext."</p>

<p>"No," Savignac admitted. "But I can say that I'm a critic only
within certain limits."</p>

<p>"Is this out of your limits?"</p>

<p>"It's out of my scale. Too big--"</p>

<p>"For human nature's daily food," Tolby interpolated. "That's
my trouble. I think the proper measure of mankind is man."</p>

<p>"Well--?"</p>

<p>"Well--did you ever read Maeterlinck on the Bee--or, rather, I
should say, on THE BEE? Rather before your day, but--you have?
Well, then you'll understand. When I began to read that book I
had imagined the bee was a small animal--insect, in fact;
something to be spoken of in a whisper, written of in airy
monosyllables--an idea justified by the dimensions of the hives
in which, I'm assured by competent authorities, a whole swarm can
be comfortably lodged, and carry on their complicated civic and
domestic affairs...Well, as I read Maeterlinck, the bee grew
and grew--like Alice after eating the cake. With each
adjective--and they rained like hailstones--that bee grew bigger.
Maeterlinck, in his admiration for the creature's mental
capacity, had endowed it with a giant's physical proportions. The
least epithet he applied to it would have fitted a Roman
emperor--or an elephant. That's what the creature became: a
winged elephant. That bee was afflicted with giantism, as they
say in French. You didn't know that giantism was a glandular
disease? Certainly! And Maeterlinck didn't give his thyroid
<i>piq&ucirc;res</i> in time--he let the creature swell and swell
till it turned into an earth-shaking megatherium among whose legs
rogue elephants could have romped..." Tolby laughed, refilled
his pipe, and stretched his contented ankles to the fire. "That's
what I told Weston, in my untutored language."</p>

<p>Halo echoed his laugh; then she said tentatively: "But I don't
quite see how I'm to apply your analogy." She was trying to
conceal from them that Vance had never breathed a word to her of
the new book.</p>

<p>Tolby raised himself on an elbow. "Savignac's the man to give
you the reasons; it's his trade. But he won't; he's too polite.
I'm just a blundering brute of a painter, who can't explain
himself in anything but pigments. And I don't know why I don't
like Goliaths, except that they've always proved so much less
paintable than the Davids."</p>

<p>"But is it the subject you think too big? Or the
characters?"</p>

<p>Savignac plunged in. "It's the scale of the pattern. It's all
part of a pattern, subject and characters. It's to be an attempt
to deal microscopically, with the infinitely little of human
experience, incalculably magnified, like those horrid close-ups
of fever microbes, when you don't know whether you're looking at
a streptococcus or the villain of a Chinese drama. Till I can
find a reason why the meanest physical reflexes should have an
&aelig;sthetic value equal to the windows of Chartres, or the
final scenes of Faust, I shall refuse to believe that they may be
legitimately treated as if they had."</p>

<p>"I should refuse even if I found the reason--but then I'm a
mere empirical Briton," Tolby rejoined.</p>

<p>Halo sat silent, trying to piece together these comments. She
began to guess why Vance had not talked to her of the book. He
had evidently caught the literary infection of Jane Meggs's back
shop, and was trying to do a masterpiece according to the new
recipe; and he had guessed that Halo would warn him against the
danger of sacrificing his individuality to a fashion or a school.
Vance was curiously wary about guarding the secrets of his work
from premature exposure; but hitherto he had seemed to feel that
with her they ran no risk. Now, instinctively, he had anticipated
her disapproval; and in a certain way it proved her power over
him.</p>

<p>For a while she reflected; then she said: "But if Vance's
elephants are winged, like Maeterlinck's, and use their wings,
won't that justify his subject and his scale?"</p>

<p>Savignac nodded. "Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose all we can do is to wait and see."</p>

<p>"Manifestly. And in the meantime all we can do is to wait for
Vance," Tolby interrupted. "He told us to be here by six--we were
to hear the first chapters. And it's nearly eight now. Have you
any idea where he is?"</p>

<p>"Not the least." Halo got up, lit a lamp, drew the heavy linen
curtains. The studio, as she shut out the dusk, grew smaller and
more intimate. Tolby threw another log on the hearth, and the
rising flame reminded her of the New York winter evenings when
she and Vance had sat over the library fire, wandering from book
to book, from vision to vision. "We were nearer to each other
then," she thought.</p>

<p>Half-past eight struck, and the two young men said they would
go off to dine, and drop in afterward to see if Vance had turned
up. They tried to persuade Halo to accompany them to the
restaurant which the group frequented; but she said she would
wait, and join them later with Vance. She drew a breath of relief
when they left; she wanted to sit down quietly and think over
what they had said of this new book.</p>

<p>The first chapters were finished, apparently, since Vance had
convoked his friends to hear them read. She knew where he kept
his papers when he was working; it would have been easy to open a
drawer in the old cabinet against the wall and rummage for the
manuscript. She longed to see it, to assure herself that Vance's
treatment of his subject would justify itself--that she would
discover in it a promise which Savignac and Tolby had missed.
Their literary judgment, to which she had attached so much
importance, suddenly seemed open to question. After all, they
were both very young, they belonged to a little clan like the
others, a number of indirect causes might unconsciously affect
their opinion. "Perhaps he's doing something that's beyond their
measure," she thought, fastening on the idea with immediate
conviction. But much as she desired to confirm it by reading the
manuscript she could not bring herself to open the drawer where
she was sure it lay. It was the first time that Vance had not
taken her into his confidence; and whatever his reasons were, she
meant to respect them. If there had been a letter from a woman in
that drawer, she reflected, it would have been almost easier to
resist looking at it. The relation between herself and Vance had
hitherto been so complete that her imagination was lazy about
picturing its disturbance. She could not think of him as desiring
another woman; but she suffered acutely from the fact that, for
the first time, he had not sought her intellectual
collaboration.</p>

<p>It was the maid's evening out, and there was no food in the
house; but Halo did not feel hungry. She thought: "When he turns
up, we'll go out and have supper, as we did that first night at
Cordova, when he couldn't eat for the beauty of it." That was
only a few months ago; but she was beginning to discover the
arbitrariness of time-measures in the sentimental world. The
memory seemed to come out of another life.</p>

<p>She stretched herself on the divan, and took up a book to
which she gave only the surface of her thoughts. Nine struck,
then half-past; almost immediately afterward, it was ten o'clock.
She was beginning to think of street accidents and other
disquieting possibilities when, toward eleven, the bell rang, and
she jumped to her feet. Vance always carried his latchkey; but he
might have mislaid or lost it. She ran to the door and opened it
on a messenger with a telegram. She fumbled for a franc, and tore
open the message under the faint gaslight of the landing. It was
dated Paris, and ran: "Off for a day or two to think over book
all right love Vance."</p>

<p>Nothing more; no explanation; no excuses; no specifying of
place or date. The baldest and vaguest statement of fact--and no
more...</p>

<p>Familiar voices rose from below, and she caught sight of
Tolby's faded Homburg hat at the turn of the stair. "No," she
called down to it, "he's not here, he's not come back; but it's
all right. I've just had a wire. He had to dash off to see
somebody...a publisher, yes, a publisher--in London...Oh,
no, thanks; really not; I'm too sleepy for supper. When I'm alone
I don't keep Montmartre hours...Thank you, my dears, thank
you...No--don't come up!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo carried the telegram back into the studio and sat down to
re-read it. The words stared at her with secretive faces that
yielded no hint of the truth. But why had she so spontaneously
fibbed about the message to those young men? In the easy world of
Montparnasse everybody came and went without making excuses or
giving reasons; only the old instinct of order and propriety,
reasserting itself in her, had made her invent that silly story
about a London publisher. Lorry was right; she evidently was not
cut out to be a poet's love! She smiled defiantly, whispered to
herself: "We'll see--" and immediately felt it incumbent, in her
new character, to develop a healthy hunger and thirst. In the
pantry she found cheese and stale biscuits, which she consumed
with the help of a cocktail; then she said: "Now I'll go to bed,
like a sensible woman--" and, instead, lit a cigarette and threw
herself again on the divan.</p>

<p>The room had grown very still. The friendly fire burned itself
out, and she was too lazy to get up and light it. Suddenly it
occurred to her that everything she had done for the last
year--from choosing her hats and dresses to replenishing the
fire, getting the right lamp shades, the right <i>menu</i> for
dinner, the right flowers for the brown jar on Vance's
table--everything had been done not for herself but for Vance.
She had no longer cared to make her life comely for its own sake;
she thought of it only in relation to her love for Vance. She
understood how a young woman full of the pride of self-adornment
might turn into a slattern if her lover left her...She must
suggest that to Vance for a story...</p>

<p>But now she saw what must have happened. Alders, she was sure,
had turned up again and persuaded Vance to go on a trip with him.
Poor Alders knew well enough that he bored her, that she secretly
disliked him; he would prefer to pour his second-rate eloquence
into Vance's uncritical ear. No doubt he and Vance had gone to
stay with some of Alders's pseudo-fashionable friends; and Vance,
aware of the faint smile with which Halo would greet such a
project, had preferred to go without telling her...Well,
probably she deserved it; she had always been too critical, had
made her likes and dislikes too evident. As if they mattered, or
anything did, except that she should go on serving and inspiring
this child of genius with whom a whim of the gods had entrusted
her...</p>

<p>Yet was it likely that Vance would have gone off on a trip
with Alders? The friends he had made in Paris, the comrades of
these last stimulating months, had relegated Alders to an obscure
corner of the background. Vance hardly ever spoke of Alders
nowadays--the only time Halo could remember his mentioning the
name, he had said: "Poor old Alders," with a shrug of
comprehension. "I wonder what's become of Alders's duke--you
remember, the one with the name like the clanging of shields?"
No; it was not likely that he had gone away with Alders.</p>

<p>If Tolby and Savignac had not been spending that very evening
with her at Vance's invitation, and in the expectation of hearing
the first pages of his new novel, Halo would have concluded that
the three friends had improvised another trip together. Tolby and
Savignac were Vance's closest friends nowadays; their
companionship had become such an intellectual necessity to him
that Halo would have been neither surprised nor resentful if he
had gone with them without including her in the party. But Vance
had invited his friends to his house, and had obviously meant to
be there to receive them; it was after he had made the
arrangement that something had occurred, something mysterious,
inexplicable, which had caused him to change his plans too
hurriedly to give Halo any clearer explanation than this cryptic
telegram. It was not Alders who had worked that change.</p>

<p>Halo started up in sudden alarm. Supposing it were not Vance
who had sent the telegram? Memories of mysterious abductions, of
forged messages from victims already dead, rushed through her
agitated mind. There was no telephone in the flat, or even in the
<i>concierge's</i> lodge below; the old-fashioned building, like
most of its kind, was without such conveniences. She would have
to go to the nearest police-station, and say--say what? That her
husband had not come home for dinner, but that she had had a
telegram from him telling her that he was all right, and would be
back in two or three days. No--that was scarcely worth carrying
to the police. She decided to wait.</p>

<p>Her glance, wandering about the studio, fell again on the old
walnut cabinet in which she was sure that Vance had put the
manuscript; and suddenly she decided to get it out and read it.
She felt that she had the right to do so. If he had withdrawn his
confidence from her she must find out about him in other
ways...She took up the lamp and carried it across to the cabinet. She
noticed that her hand was trembling. "One would think I was a
jealous woman expecting to find a love-letter," she smiled to
herself--and felt the smile harden on her lips.</p>

<p>What a fool she had been! Why shouldn't there be love-letters
in that drawer? How was it that never, till that moment, the most
probable reason for Vance's gradual detachment had occurred to
her? Intellectual companionship? Spiritual union? Rubbish! A
young man with a fiery imagination wanted a new woman--a
succession of new women--for his flame to feed on. The lives of
the poets and artists all proved it--showed how the flame
devoured one lovely victim after another, how many had to be
heaped on the pyre of genius! If Vance had ceased to talk to her
about his work it was because he was talking about it to some
other woman. Since the beginning of the world there had been no
other clue to the withdrawal of one lover from another. All
Halo's intellectual subtleties shrivelled up in the glare of this
truth.</p>

<p>She set the lamp down and stood studying the carved doors
behind which the answer to the riddle perhaps lay. She no longer
thought of the novel--what she saw, through those worm-eaten
panels, was a packet of letters in a woman's writing. Was the
writing known or unknown to her? Even that she could not guess.
Her imagination, racing backward over the last weeks and months,
scrutinized one after another the feminine faces in their group,
trying to recall some significant glance or word of Vance's. But
though these young women obviously interested and amused him, he
seemed to treat them all with an odd detachment, and she could
not remember his having shown a preference for one above the
others. But how did she know that in the course of his Parisian
wanderings he had not come across some one she had never seen or
even heard of? The chance propinquity of a caf&eacute; or a
cinema might have sufficed to undo her life, and put this burning
anguish in her heart--this pain so new that she pressed her hands
to her breast and whispered: "Oh, God, dear God--only not
<i>that!</i> Oh, God, don't let it be that!"</p>

<p>It seemed too cruel for endurance that all the treasures of
her love for Vance, and the passionate year which had been its
flowering, should be at the mercy of some unknown woman's laugh,
of the way her eyelashes grew, or her shoulder sloped as the
dress drooped from it...</p>

<p>"But how do I know it's an unknown woman?" She remembered how
long she and Vance had loved each other without its being
suspected; she recalled all the devices and prevarications that
had shielded their growing passion, and had seemed so natural and
necessary. He might have been carrying on an intrigue for weeks
with some woman they were meeting constantly at caf&eacute;s, at
dances, at Lorry's...She broke off, as if her brother's name
had brought enlightenment. At Lorry's--but of course! What else
was the meaning of Lorry's unaccountable diatribe against the
women who came to his studio? He had told Halo they were not fit
to associate with her; and she had laughed, and wondered what
could be the cause of this new prudery. Now she saw how the bits
of the puzzle fitted into each other, and smiled at her own
dulness. What he had obviously been trying to do was to warn her
of Vance's peril. Perhaps he was jealous of Vance; perhaps Jane
Meggs had been too kind to him. The power of such women was so
insidious that though Lorry despised Jane, and laughed at her, he
could not do without her, and he had probably meant Halo to take
the warning and pass it on to Vance.</p>

<p>Then again--what was it that Tolby and Savignac had hinted
about the new book? Why, that it belonged to the type of
literature in which Jane Meggs specialized. Not the kind she kept
in her back shop; they could hardly have meant that; but that
Vance had been too much influenced by the stream-of-consciousness
school which Jane's group proclaimed to a bewildered public to be
the one model for modern fiction.</p>

<p>Jane Meggs! How a woman of that sort would know how to flatter
Vance, astonish his inexperience, amuse him by her literary
jargon, fascinate him by her moral perversity. Even the ugliness
which Jane flaunted as though it were <i>her</i> kind of beauty,
the kind she wanted and had deliberately chosen, might have a
coarse fascination for him. Perhaps at this very minute he was
with her, in the little flat to which she boasted that even Lorry
had never been admitted...</p>

<p>Halo turned from the cabinet. She no longer wanted to open its
hidden drawers. How should she bear the sight of the truth, when
the imaging of it was so intolerable?</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c11">XI</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Vance, when he left the quay, had meant to turn homeward. He
liked strolling at twilight through the Luxembourg quarter, where
great doorways opened on courtyards with mouldering plaster
statues, where the tall garden walls were looped with bunches of
blueish ivy, and every yard of the way, behind those secretive
walls, a story hung like fruit for him to gather. But he found it
harder than ever to leave the Seine. Each moment, as night fell,
and the lights came out, the face of the river grew more changing
and mysterious. Where the current turned under the slopes of
Passy a prodigal sunset flooded the brown waves with crimson and
mulberry; at the point where he stood the dusky waters were
already sprinkled with fluctuating lights from barges and
steamboats; but toward the Louvre and Notre-Dame all was in the
uncertainty of night.</p>

<p>Tolby and Savignac were to come that afternoon to hear him
read the first chapters of his new novel: "Colossus". After
pouring out to them, the night before, his large confused vision
of the book, Vance had suggested their hearing what he had
already written; but he regretted it now, for in the discussion
which had followed they had raised so many questions that he
would have preferred not to show the first pages till he had
worked over them a little longer. Besides, in the excitement of
talking over his project, he had forgotten that if they came for
the promised reading Halo would find out for the first time that
he was at work on a new novel. Vance had not meant to keep his
plan a secret from her; in such matters his action was always
instinctive. His impulse was simply to talk over what he was
doing with whichever listener was most likely to stimulate the
dim creative process; and that listener was no longer Halo. Vance
was sure that he loved her as much as ever, was as happy as ever
in her company; it was not his fault or hers if the deep workings
of his imagination were no longer roused by her presence.</p>

<p>This did not greatly trouble him; he took his stimulus where
he found it, as a bee goes to the right flower. But since Halo's
outburst at Granada, when he had gone to the old Marquesa's
without her, he had felt in her a jealous vigilance which was
perhaps what checked his confidences. She seemed to resent
whatever excluded her from his pursuits; but though it troubled
him to hurt her he could not give up the right to live his inner
life in his own way, and the conflict disquieted and irritated
him. Of late he had forgotten such minor problems. When he was
planning a new book the turmoil of his mind was always enclosed
in a great natural peace, and during those weeks of mysterious
brooding he had not once thought of what Halo would think or say;
but now he felt she would be hurt at his having told Tolby and
Savignac of the new book before she knew of it.</p>

<p>His first idea was to get hold of his friends and put off the
reading; but a glance at his watch showed that they must already
be at the studio awaiting him. The worst of it was that they had
probably told Halo what they had come for..."Oh, hell," Vance
groaned. He stood still on the crowded pavement, thinking
impatiently: "If only I could cut it all--." Well, why shouldn't
he? This book possessed him. What he wanted above everything was
to be alone with it, and away from everybody for a day or two,
till he could clear his mind and get the whole thing back into
its right perspective--just to lie somewhere on a grass-bank in
the sun, and think and think.</p>

<p>He looked up and down the quays, and then turned and signed to
a taxi. "Gare de Lyon!" he called out. He felt suddenly hungry,
and remembered that somebody had said you could get a first-rate
meal at the Gare de Lyon. Dining at a great terminus, in the rush
of arrivals and departures, would give him the illusion of
escape; and the quarter was so remote that by the time he got
home his friends would probably have left, and Halo have gone to
bed...and the explanation could be deferred till the next
day.</p>

<p>In the station restaurant a crowd of people were eating
automatically in a cold glare of light. He had meant to order a
good dinner, and then wander aimlessly about the streets, as he
liked to do at night when ideas were churning in him. But the
sight of all those travellers with their hand-luggage stacked at
their feet, and something fixed and distant in their eyes,
increased his desire to escape, and again he thought: "Why not?"
He snatched a sandwich from the buffet, and hurried to the
telegraph office to send a message to Halo; then, his conscience
eased, he began to stroll from one platform to another,
consulting the signboards with the names of the places for which
the trains were leaving...Dijon...Lyons...Avignon...
Marseilles...Ventimiglia...every name woke in him a
different sonority, the deeper in proportion to the mystery.
Lyons, Marseilles--the great cities--called up miles of streets
lined with closely packed houses, and in every house innumerable
rooms full of people, all strange and remote from him, yet all
moved by the common springs of hunger, lust, ambition...That
vision of miles and miles of unknown humanity packed together in
stifling propinquity, each nucleus revolving about its own tiny
orbit, with passions as intractable as those that govern heroes
and overthrow kingdoms, always seized him when he entered a new
city. But other names--Avignon, Ventimiglia, Spezia--sang with
sweeter cadences, made him yearn for their mysterious cliffs and
inlets (he pictured them all as encircled by summer seas). His
geography was as vague as that of a mediaeval mapmaker; but he
was sure those places must be at least as far off as Cadiz or
Cordova, and he turned reluctantly from the enchanted
platform.</p>

<p>On a signboard farther on he saw a familiar name:
Fontainebleau. Though it was so near he had never been there; but
he knew there was a forest there, and he felt that nothing would
so fit in with his mood as to wander endlessly and alone under
trees. He saw that a train was starting in ten minutes; he bought
his ticket and got in.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A man in the compartment, who said he was an American painter,
told Vance of an inn on the edge of the forest where he would be
away from everybody--especially from the painters, his adviser
ironically added. He himself was going on to Sens, where they
didn't bother you much as yet...Vance got out at
Fontainebleau, woke up the keeper of the inn, and slept in a hard
little bed the dreamless sleep of the runaway schoolboy.</p>

<p>The next morning he was up early, and as soon as he could coax
a cup of coffee from the landlady he started off into the forest.
He did not know till then that he had never before seen a forest.
In America he had seen endless acres of trees; but they were
saplings, the growth of yesterday. Here at last was an ancient
forest, a forest with great isolated trees, their branches heavy
with memory, gazing in meditative majesty down glades through
which legendary cavalcades came riding. For miles he walked on
under immense low-spreading beeches; then a trail through the
bracken led him out on a white sandy clearing full of fantastic
rocks, where birch-trees quivered delicately above cushions of
purplish heather. Still farther, in another region, he came on
hollows of turf brooded over by ancient oaks, on pools from which
waterbirds started up crying, and grass-drives narrowing away to
blue-brown distances like the background of tapestries. The
forest seemed endless; it enclosed him on every side. He could
not imagine anything beyond it. In its all-embracing calm his
nervous perturbations ceased. Face to face with this majesty of
nature, this great solitude which had stood there, never
expecting him yet always awaiting him, he felt the same deep
union with earth that once or twice in his life he had known by
the seashore.</p>

<p>After a while he grew tired of walking, and lay down to ponder
on his book. In that immemorial quiet the voice of his thoughts
came to him clear of the other voices entangling it. He had tried
to explain the book to his two friends, and he knew he had
failed, perhaps because he could not detach his own ideas from
the dense thicket of ideas which flourished in the air of Paris.
Or perhaps his friends' minds were too well-ordered and logical
to tolerate the amorphous mass he had tried to force into them.
"Colossus"--he had pitched on the title as expressing that
unwieldy bulk.</p>

<p>The endless talks about the arts of expression which went on
in the circle presided over by Lorry and Jane Meggs had roused in
Vance a new tendency to self-analysis. Especially when they
discussed the writing of fiction--one of their most frequent
themes--he felt that he had been practising blindly, almost
automatically, what these brilliant and intensely aware young
people regarded as the most self-conscious of arts. Their
superior cultivation made it impossible to brush aside their
theories and pronouncements as he had the outpourings of the
young men in Rebecca Stram's studio; he felt compelled to listen
and to examine their arguments, fallacious as some of them
seemed.</p>

<p>When they said that fiction, as the art of narrative and the
portrayal of social groups, had reached its climax, and could
produce no more (citing Raphael and Ingres as analogous instances
in painting)--that unless the arts were renewed they were doomed,
and that in fiction the only hope of renewal was in the
exploration of the subliminal, his robust instinct told him that
the surface of life was rich enough to feed the creator's
imagination. But though he resisted the new theories they lamed
his creative impulse, and he began to look back with contempt on
what he had already done. The very popularity of "The Puritan in
Spain" confirmed his dissatisfaction. A book that pleased the
public was pretty sure not to have been worth writing. He
remembered Frenside's saying that "Instead" was a pretty fancy,
but not to be repeated, and he knew that "The Puritan" was simply
a skilful variation on "Instead". Evidently he was on the wrong
tack, and his clever new friends must be right...</p>

<p>But what was the alternative they proposed? A microscopic
analysis of the minute in man, as if the highest imaginative art
consisted in decomposing him into his constituent atoms. And at
that Vance instantly rebelled. The new technique might be right,
but their application of it substituted pathology for invention.
Man was man by virtue of the integration of his atoms, not of
their dispersal. It was not when you had taken him apart that you
could realize him, but when you had built him up. The fishers in
the turbid stream-of-consciousness had reduced their fictitious
characters to a bundle of loosely tied instincts and habits,
borne along blindly on the current of existence. Why not reverse
the process, reduce the universe to its component dust, and set
man whole and dominant above the ruins? What landmarks were there
in the wilderness of history but the great men rising here and
there above the herd? And was not even the average man great, if
you pictured him as pitted against a hostile universe, and
surviving, and binding it to his uses? It was that average man
whom Vance wanted to depict in his weakness and his power.
"Colossus"--the name was not wholly ironic; it symbolized the new
vision, the great firm outline, that he wanted to project against
the petty chaos of Jane Meggs's world. Only, how was it to be
done?</p>

<p>He tried to carry over his gray theory into the golden world
of creation; but the scents and sounds of the forest made him
drowsy, and he lay on a warm slope, gazing upward, and letting
the long drifts of blue sky and snowy cumulus filter between his
eyelids.</p>

<p>Presently he grew hungry, and remembered that before starting
he had stuffed his pockets with sandwiches and a flask of wine.
He made his meal, and continued to lie on the grass-bank, smoking
and dozing, and murmuring over snatches of sylvan poetry, from
Faust's Walpurgis ride to the branch-charmed oaks of
Hyperion.</p>

<p>At last he got up, shook the tufts of grass from his coat, and
wandered on. The afternoon was perfect. The sun poured down from
a sky banked with still clouds, and the air smelt of fading
bracken and beech-leaves, and the spice of heather bloom. Why
couldn't he always live near a forest, have this populous
solitude at his door? What were cities and societies for but to
sterilize the imagination? People were of no use to him, even the
cleverest, when it came to his work--what he needed was this
tireless renewal of earth's functions, the way of a forest with
the soul...</p>

<p>He pulled off his coat and swung along in his shirtsleeves,
glowing with the afternoon warmth of the woods. It seemed
impossible that outside of those enchanted bounds winds blew,
rain fell, and the earth plunged on toward a decaying year. He
thought of purple grapes on hot trellises, of the amber fires of
Poussin's "Poet and the Muse", of Keats's mists and mellow
fruitfulness, and the blue lightning-lit windows in the nameless
church. He had lost all sense of direction, and did not know
whether he was near the edge of the forest, or far from it, when
suddenly he came on an open space flooded with sun, and a bank
where a girl lay asleep. At least he supposed she was asleep,
from the relaxed lines of her body; but he could not be sure, for
she had opened her sunshade and planted it slantwise in the
ground, so that its dome roofed her in, and hid her face.</p>

<p>Vance stood and looked at her. She was as sunlit and
mysterious as his mood. A dress of some thin stuff modelled the
long curves of her body; her ankles were crossed, and the slim
arched feet, in sandal-like shoes, looked as if feathers might
grow from them when she stirred. But she lay still, apparently
unaware of him and of all the world.</p>

<p>He gazed at the picture in a mood of soft excitement. He
wanted to lift the sunshade and surprise the wonder in her eyes.
But would she be surprised? No; only a little amused, he thought.
Dryads must be used to such encounters, and she would simply fit
him into her dreams, and put her arms around his neck and her
lips to his.</p>

<p>Perhaps every man had his Endymion-hour--only what if Diana,
instead of vanishing in a silver mist, should say: "Let's go off
together," and give Endymion her address? No...she must
remain a part of his dream, a flicker of light among the leaves...</p>

<p>He turned away, still in the nymph's toils. As he walked on he
saw coming toward him a stoutish common-looking young man with a
straw hat tilted back on his head, and a self-satisfied smile on
a coarse lip. He wore a new suit of clothes and walked jauntily,
swinging his stick and glancing ahead as if in pleasant
expectation--an ordinary, not unkindly-looking youth, evidently
satisfied with himself and what awaited him. Was he on his way to
meet the roadside dryad? Had she fallen asleep as she lay in the
sun and waited? Vance was annoyed by the thought; in looking at
the man's face he seemed to have seen the girl's, and the world
of earthly things re-entered the forest. He did not scorn those
earthly things; a common good-natured man kissing a flushed girl
under a tavern arbour was a pleasant enough sight. But he wanted
something rarer in his memory of the forest, and he turned
indifferently from the meeting of Diana and Endymion.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c12">XII</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He got back late to the inn, and after dining went to bed, and
to sleep--the sleep of a young body replete with exercise, and a
mind heavy with visions. But in the middle of the night, he sat
up suddenly awake. The moon streamed across his bed and fringed
with a blueish halo the chair and table between himself and the
window. "Diana after all!" he thought, his brain starting into
throbbing activity. He seemed to be in the forest road again,
watching the sleeping girl; and he asked himself how he could
have left her and gone on. There she had lain, mysterious goddess
of the cross-roads, one of the wandering divinities a man meets
when he is young, and never afterward; yet he had turned from
her, afraid of disenchantment. What cowardice--what lack of
imagination! Because he had seen a common-looking man coming
toward her, and had concluded that she must be like him, he had
run away from the magic of the unknown, the possibilities that
lie in the folded hour. And now it was too late, and he would
never see her again, or recapture his vanished mood...</p>

<p>It was not the fear of hurting Halo which had held him back.
At the moment he had not even thought of her. But now he suddenly
saw that, should he ever drift into a casual love-affair, she
would probably suffer far more than poor Laura Lou with all her
uncontrollable fits of suspicion and resentment. The idea was new
to him; he had always pictured Halo as living above such
turmoils, in the calm upper sphere of reason. But now he
understood that her very calmness probably intensified her
underlying emotions. There swept back upon him the physical and
mental torture of his jealousy of Floss Delaney, the girl who had
taught him the extremes of joy and pain, and he was oppressed by
the thought that he might have made Halo suffer in the same
way.</p>

<p>He wondered now how he, who vibrated to every pang of the
beings he created, could have been so unperceiving and unfeeling.
His imagination had matured, but in life he had remained a
blundering boy. He had left Paris abruptly, without warning or
excuse, he had not even followed up his vague telegram by a
letter of explanation. But how explain, when the explanation
would have been: "Darling, I love you, but I want to get away
from you"?--After all, he mused, they were both free, and Halo
knew that there are times when a man needs his liberty...But
what if "liberty", in such cases, means the license to do what
would cause suffering if found out? License to wound, and escape
the consequences? He lay on his bed, and stared into the future.
How did two people who had once filled each other's universe
manage to hold together as the tide receded? Why, by the
world-old compulsion of marriage, he supposed. Marriage was a
trick, a sham, if you looked at it in one way; but it was the
only means man had yet devised for defending himself from his own
frivolity.</p>

<p>He was struck by something august and mysterious in the fact
of poor humanity's building up this barrier against itself. To
the Catholic church marriage was a divine institution; but it
seemed to him infinitely more impressive as an emanation of the
will of man...He fell asleep muttering: "That's it...we
must be married...must be married at once..." and when he
woke, Diana and the moon were gone, and the autumn rain clouded
his window.</p>

<p>He woke in a mood of quiet. It was almost always so: after a
phase of agitation and uncertainty, in which he seemed to have
frittered away his powers in the useless effort to reconcile life
and art, at the moment when he felt his creative faculty slipping
away from him forever, there it stood at his side, as though in
mockery of his self-distrust. So it had been when Laura Lou was
dying, so no doubt it would be whenever life and art fought out
their battle in him. He dressed and called for his coffee; then
he sat down to write.</p>

<p>That girl in the forest! He knew now why she had been put
there. To make his first chapter out of--glorious destiny! He
laughed, lit a cigarette, and wrote on. Oh, the freedom, the
quiet, the blessed awayness from all things! One by one the pages
fell from table to floor, noiseless and regular as the fall of
leaves in the forest. His isolation seemed invulnerable. Even the
rain on his window was in the conspiracy, and hung its veil
between his too-eager eyes and the solicitations of the outer
world, shutting him into a magic-making solitude...</p>

<p>The day passed in that other-dimensional world of the
imagination. His pen drove on and on. The very fact that Halo was
not there to pick up the pages, and transfer them to the cool
mould of her Remington, gave a glorious freedom to his periods.
There they lay on the floor, untrammelled and unwatched as
himself. He recalled the old days of his poverty and obscurity in
New York, when he had sat alone in his fireless boarding-house
room, pouring out prose and poetry till his brain reeled with
hunger and fatigue; and he knew now that those hours had been the
needful prelude to whatever he had accomplished since. "You have
to go plumb down to the Mothers to fish up the real thing," he
thought exultantly.</p>

<p>Night came, and he turned on the weak electric light and
continued to write. To his strong young eyes the page was as
clear as by day. But at last the pen slipped from his hand, and
sleep overcame him.</p>

<p>When he woke he felt chilly and hungry, his wrist was stiff,
his eyes and forehead ached. The scribbled-over sheets lay at his
feet in a heap--dead leaves indeed! He had come back to reality,
and the world where he had spent those fervid hours had vanished
in mist. He thought of Halo, of Paris, of all the interwoven
threads of his life; he felt weak and puzzled as a child. "I must
get back," he said to himself; and he gathered up his papers.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was late when he reached Paris; but he took his way home on
foot through the drizzle, down the Boulevard Sebastopol to the
Seine, and through the old streets of the left bank to the
Luxembourg. He was trying to put off his home-coming; not because
he was troubled by the excuses and explanations he might have to
offer, but because he dreaded the moment when the last frail
shreds of his dream should detach themselves. After one of these
plunges into the depths he always rose to the surface sore and
bewildered; it was a relief to know that at that hour Halo would
probably be in bed and asleep, and explanations could be deferred
till the morrow. "Unless," he reflected, "she's out--at the
theatre, perhaps--or dancing." It was the first time since they
had been together that he had pictured Halo as having a life of
her own, a personality of her own, plans, arrangements, perhaps
interests and sympathies unknown to him. "Funny..." he
reflected..."when I go away anywhere I always shut up the
idea of her in a box, as if she were a toy; or turn her to the
wall, like an unfinished picture..." And he recalled the
distant days in New York, when he saw her so seldom, and when, in
their long hours of separation, his feverish imagination followed
her through every moment of her life, stored up every allusion to
her friends, her engagements, hunted out the addresses of the
people she had said she was lunching or dining with, and tried to
picture the houses in which she was being entertained, what she
was saying to the persons about her, and how her voice sounded
when it was not to him that she was speaking...</p>

<p>He found his latchkey, and entered the narrow hall. The door
leading to the studio was half-open. Through it he saw the lamp
on his desk, a cluster of red dahlias in the brown jar, and a
table near the fire with wineglasses, chafing-dish and a bottle
of white wine. Such an intimate welcome emanated from the scene
that he drew back with the shyness of an intruder. She was out;
he had been right; but before starting she had prepared this
little supper for her return. Supper for two; probably for Tolby
and herself. She had always liked Tolby--the young Englishman was
more like the type of man she had been used to in her own circle
of friends. He had Tarrant's social ease, the cool bantering
manner which Vance had long since despaired of acquiring. Yes;
she was probably with Tolby...The thought was curiously
distasteful.</p>

<p>A door opened, and from the bedroom Halo came out. She had
flung a crimson silk dressing-gown over her shoulders, and her
dark hair fell about her temples in soft disordered curls. She
looked sleepy, happy and unsurprised. "I thought you'd be back
tonight." She put her arm about his neck, and he plunged with all
his senses into the familiar atmosphere of her perfume, her
powder, the mossy softness of her hair. "I knew you'd be as
hungry as a wolf," she laughed, drawing him to the table by the
fire. "Do you remember that night at Cordova? Come and see if
I've provided the right things."</p>

<p>He looked about him with a low satisfied laugh. "It's good to
get back," he said, laying a kiss on her bare nape as she stooped
above the chafing-dish. She turned her face, and he saw that it
was all his, from trembling lashes to parted lips. "Well, how did
the work go?" she asked, putting him aside while she bent to
break the eggs into the dish; and he answered: "Oh, great--but
the best of going away is the coming back..."</p>

<p>"Look! Fresh mushrooms!" she cried, uncovering another dish;
and as the warm savour of the cooking filled the air he threw
himself back into his armchair, folding his arms luxuriously
behind his head and said, half-laughing, half-seriously: "Do you
know I could have sworn I saw you yesterday in the forest, asleep
under a white umbrella? But your face was hidden, so I couldn't
be sure."</p>

<p>"And you didn't look?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't look."</p>

<p>She tossed him the corkscrew, scooped the smoking mess of eggs
and mushrooms into their two plates, and said laughingly:
"Come."</p>

<p>He uncorked the Chablis, drew his chair up, and fell joyfully
upon the feast. How she knew how to take a man, to ease off
difficult moments, what to take for granted, what to leave
unsaid! What he had told her was true; a home-coming like this
was even better than the going away. A bright hearth, good food,
good wine; the sense of ease, of lifted burdens, and a great
inner exhilaration at the thought of work to come--this was how
love repaid him for his escapade. He looked at Halo, and
surprised her eyes fixed on his; and suddenly he felt that at the
very heart of their intimacy the old problem lurked, and that
never, even in their moments of closest union, would they really
understand each other. But the sensation barely brushed his soul.
The next moment it was expanding in the glow of fire and wine,
and Halo's eyes shone with the old confiding tenderness. He
filled his glass and began to talk to her about the new book.</p>

<p>How easy it was now to pour out what he had so jealously
guarded before! The fruit was ripe, and it was sweet to heap it
at her feet as she sat listening in the old way, her lids
lowered, her chin propped in her hand. Nothing escaped her--she
listened with every faculty, as she used to in the long summer
days at the Willows. She said little, put few questions; but when
she spoke it was always to single out what he knew was good, or
touch interrogatively on some point still doubtful. The night was
nearly over when he gathered up his pages. "Lord--what an hour!
I've tired you out; and I've never even asked what you've been up
to while I was away." With sudden compunction he put his arm
about her.</p>

<p>"What I've been up to? Accepting dinner invitations for you,
for one thing! You won't mind? Lorry wants you to dine at the
studio tomorrow: a big blowout for Mrs. Glaisher, who has
developed a sudden interest in theatrical art and may
possibly--he thinks probably--help him to produce his ballet. You
know how hard he's been trying for it."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Glaisher? Who on earth's Mrs. Glaisher?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you remember? One of the principal characters in
your next-but-one-novel: 'Park Avenue'. She's waiting to sit to
you: a Museum specimen of the old New York millionairess. If only
she would subsidize 'Factories' Lorry's future would be
assured--or so he thinks. And he implores you on his knees to
come and help him out. Mrs. Glaisher's very particular; she's
named her guests, and the author of 'The Puritan in Spain' was
first on the list. I'm sorry for you, darling--but you've got to
go."</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks," Vance growled. "I don't believe she ever heard
of me."</p>

<p>"How little you know of the world you're trying to write
about! Mrs. Glaisher has found out that it's the thing for the
rich to patronize the arts, and she means to eclipse Mrs.
Pulsifer. Suppose she should found a prize for the longest novel
ever written--just at the moment when 'Colossus' appears?" She
put her arms about Vance's neck and laughed up at him. "You'll
go, dear--just for Lorry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right; but don't let's think of boring things now."
He brushed her hair from her forehead, and looked deeply into her
eyes; then, when she slipped away, he sank into his chair and
abandoned himself to the joy of re-reading the words freshly
illuminated by her praise.</p>

<p>When he pulled himself out of his brooding, and went to bed,
Halo was asleep. He had carried in the lamp from the studio, and
stood shading it with his hand while he looked down on her.
Usually, when she slept, her features regained their girlish
clearness; and she was once more the Halo Spear who had lit up
the dark old library at the Willows; but now youth and laughter
were gone, her face was worn and guarded. "This is the real
Halo," he thought; and he knew it was the effort to hide her
anxiety behind a laughing welcome which had left those furrows
between her eyes.</p>

<p>"If only," he mused in a burst of contrition, "I could
remember beforehand not to make her unhappy..."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>From the moment of entering Lorry Spear's studio Mrs. Glaisher
dominated it. Vance was not the only guest conscious of her
prepotency. She was one of the powerful social engines he had
caught a glimpse of in the brief months of his literary success
in New York, three years earlier; but at that moment his life had
been so packed with anxieties and emotions that he could hardly
take separate note of the figures whirling past him.</p>

<p>The only woman he had known who vied in wealth and worldly
importance with Mrs. Glaisher was the lady who had invited him to
her huge museum-like house, shown him her pictures and
tapestries, and failed, at the last moment, to give him the
short-story prize on which all his hopes depended. But Mrs.
Pulsifer was a shadowy figure compared with Mrs. Glaisher, a mere
bundle of uncertainties and inhibitions. Mrs. Glaisher was of
more robust material. She was as massive as her furniture and as
inexhaustible as her bank-account. Mrs. Pulsifer's scruples and
contradictions would have been unintelligible to a woman who, for
forty years, had hewed her way toward a goal she had never even
faintly made out.</p>

<p>After a long life devoted to the standardized entertaining of
the wealthy, Mrs. Glaisher had suddenly discovered that Grand
Opera, <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras,</i> terrapin and
Rolls-Royces were no longer the crowning attributes of her class;
and undismayed and unperplexed she had begun to buy Picassos and
Modiglianis, to invite her friends to hear Stravinsky and Darius
Milhaud, to patronize exotic dancers, and labour privately (it
was the hardest part of her task) over the pages of
"Ulysses".</p>

<p>As Vance watched her arrival he guessed in how many strange
places that unblenching satin slipper had been set, and read, in
the fixity of her smile, and the steady gaze of her small
inquisitive eyes, her resolve to meet without wavering any shock
that might await her. He thought of Halo's suggestion for his
next novel, and was amused at the idea of depicting this
determined woman who, during an indefatigable life-time, had seen
almost everything and understood nothing.</p>

<p>Lorry's studio had been hastily tidied up, as Jane Meggs and
her friend understood the job; but Vance saw Mrs. Glaisher's
recoil from the dusty floor and blotched walls, and the intensity
of her resolve to behave as if Mimi Pinson's garret were her
normal dwelling. Electric lamps dangling in uncertain garlands
lit up a dinner-table contrived out of drawing-boards and
trestles, and the end of the room was masked by a tall
clothes'-horse hung with a Cubist rug, from behind which peeped
the competent face of the <i>restaurateur</i> charged with the
material side of the entertainment; for Lorry had seen to it
that, whatever else lacked, wine and food should be up to the
Park Avenue standard.</p>

<p>With Mrs. Glaisher was a small sharp-elbowed lady, whose
lavishly exposed anatomy showed the most expensive Lido glaze.
Her quick movements and perpetual sidelong observance of her
friend reminded Vance of a very intelligent little dog watching,
without interfering with, the advance of a determined blind man.
"Oh, don't you know? That's Lady Pevensey--the one they all call
'Imp'," Jane Meggs explained to Vance as Lorry led him toward
Mrs. Glaisher. The others all seemed to know Lady Pevensey, and
she distributed handshakes, "darlings", and "I haven't seen you
in several ages", with such impartial intimateness that Vance was
surprised when Savignac, to whom she had just cried out:
"<i>Tiens, mon vieux, comme tu es en beaut&eacute; ce soir!"</i>
enquired in a whisper who she was.</p>

<p>The party consisted of Lorry's trump cards--the new composer,
Andros Nevsky, who, as soon as he could be persuaded to buckle
down to writing the music of "Factories", was to reduce
Stravinsky and "The Six" to back numbers; the poet, Yves
Tourment, who, after an adolescence of over twenty years, still
hung on the verge of success; Sady Lenz, the Berlin ballerina,
who was to create the chief part in Lorry's spectacle; Hedstrom,
the new Norse novelist, and Brank Heff, the coming American
sculptor, whom the knowing were selling their Mestrovics to
collect; and, to put a little fluency and sparkle into this knot
of international celebrities, such easy comrades and good talkers
as Tolby, Savignac, and others of their group.</p>

<p>Vance was so much amused and interested that he had forgotten
his own part in the show, and was surprised when Lorry called him
up to be introduced to Mrs. Glaisher, and he heard that lady
declare: "I told Mr. Spear I wouldn't dine with him unless he
invited you, not even to meet all the other celebrities in
Paris."</p>

<p>"Ah, no: Nosie's so headstrong we couldn't do anything with
her," Lady Pevensey intervened, startling Vance by putting her
arm through his, and almost as much by revealing that Mrs.
Glaisher was known to her intimates as "Nosie". "Nosie's been
simply screaming to everybody: 'I <i>must</i> have the man who
wrote "The Puritan"', and when Lorry found you'd disappeared
without leaving an address Nosie couldn't be pacified till she
heard that you'd turned up. Lorry, darling, you've put Vance next
to her at table, haven't you? Oh, Jane, love, tell him he
<i>must!</i> I know she idolizes Nevsky, and she's been dying for
years to meet darling Yves--but she won't be able to speak a word
of French to them, much less Norwegian to Hedstrom," (this in a
tragic whisper to Lorry) "so for God's sake pacify the Polar
Lions somehow, and let Nosie have her Puritan."</p>

<p>But with foreigners as his guests Lorry protested that he
could hardly seat his young compatriot next to the chief guest of
the evening, and Vance was put opposite to Mrs. Glaisher, who sat
between Lorry and the silent and bewildered Norse novelist. Vance
was amused to see that Lorry had chosen the most inarticulate man
in the room as Mrs. Glaisher's neighbour. In this way he kept her
to himself, while Lady Pevensey, on his right, was fully engaged
between Yves Tourment and Savignac's sallies from across the
table.</p>

<p>Lorry had done his job well. The food was excellent, the
champagne irreproachable; he had dressed up in the gay rags of
Bohemia an entertainment based on the most solid gastronomic
traditions, and Mrs. Glaisher, eating truffled <i>poularde</i>
and <i>langouste &agrave; l'Am&eacute;ricaine,</i> was convinced
that she was sharing the daily fare of a band of impecunious
artists.</p>

<p>Down the table, Nevsky, in fluent Russian French, was
expounding to Jane Meggs his theory of the effect of the new
music on glandular secretions in both sexes, and Brank Heff, the
American sculptor, stimulated by numerous preliminary cocktails,
broke his usual heavy silence to discuss with Fr&auml;ulein Sady
Lenz her merits as a possible subject for his chisel. "What I
want is a woman with big biceps and limp breasts. I guess you'd
do first rate...How about your calves, though? They as ugly as
your arms? I guess you haven't danced enough yet to develop the
particular deformity I'm after..."</p>

<p>When the conversation flagged Jane Meggs started it up again
with a bilingual scream; and above the polyglot confusion rose
Lorry's masterful voice, proclaiming to Mrs. Glaisher: "What we
want is to break the old moulds, to demolish the old landmarks...When
Cl&eacute;menceau pulled down the Colonne Vend&ocirc;me
the fools thought he was doing it for political reasons...the
Commune, or some such drivel. Pure rot, of course! He was merely
obeying the old human instinct of destruction...the artist's
instinct: destroying to renew. Why, didn't Christ Himself say: 'I
will make all things new'? Quite so--and so would I, if I could
afford to buy an axe. Just picture to yourself the lack of
imagination there is in putting up with the old things--things
made to please somebody else, long before we were born, to please
people who would have bored us to death if we'd known them. Who
ever consulted you and me when the Pyramids were built--or
Versailles? Why should we be saddled with all that old dead
masonry? Ruins are what we want--more ruins! Look what an asset
ruins are to the steamship companies and the tourist agencies.
The more ruins we provide them with the bigger their dividends
will be. And so with the other arts--isn't every antiquary simply
running a Cook's tour through the dead d&eacute;bris of the past?
The more old houses and furniture and pictures we scrap, the more
valuable what's left will be, and the happier we'll make the
collectors...If only the lucky people who have the means to
pull down and build up again had the imagination to do it..."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it: we <i>must</i> have imagination," Mrs.
Glaisher announced in the same decisive tone in which, thirty
years ago, she might have declared: "We <i>must</i> have central
heating."</p>

<p>"If you say so, dear lady, we shall have it--we shall have it
already!" cried Lorry in an inspired tone, lifting his champagne
glass to Mrs. Glaisher's; while Yves Tourment shrilled in his
piercing falsetto: "<i>Vive Saint H&eacute;rode, roi des
iconoclastes!"</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Glaisher, who had paled a little at her host's Scriptural
allusion, recovered when she saw that the words were not meant to
deride but to justify; and at Yves Tourment's apostrophe she
exclaimed, with beaming incomprehension: "Who's that whose health
they're drinking? I don't want to be left out of anything."</p>

<p>Presently the improvised dinner-table was cleared and
demolished, and the guests scattered about the studio, at the
farther end of which a stage had been prepared for Fr&auml;ulein
Lenz. Mrs. Glaisher, slightly flushed by her libations to the
iconoclasts, and emboldened by her evident success with the
lights of Montparnasse, stood smilingly expectant while Lorry and
Lady Pevensey brought up the notabilities of the party; but
linguistic obstacles on both sides restricted the exchange of
remarks, and Vance, who had stood watching, and wishing Halo were
there to share his amusement, soon found it his turn to be
summoned.</p>

<p>"You're the person she's really come for, you know; do tell
her everything you can think of," Lady Pevensey prompted him:
"about how you write, I mean, and what the publishers pay
you--she's particularly keen about that--and whether you're
having an exciting love-affair with anybody; she adores a dash of
heart-interest," she added, as she pushed Vance toward the divan
on which Mrs. Glaisher throned.</p>

<p>Vance remembered a far-off party at the Tarrants', the first
he had ever been to, and how Halo had dragged him from the
book-shelf where he had run to earth his newly-discovered Russian
novelists, and carried him off to be introduced to Mrs. Pulsifer.
That evening had been a mere bright blur, to which he was
astonished to find himself contributing part of the dazzle;
whereas now he looked on without bewilderment or undue elation.
But he did think it a pity that Halo, on the pretext of a
headache (though really, she owned, because such occasions bored
her) had obstinately refused to accompany him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Glaisher's greeting betrayed not only her satisfaction at
capturing a rising novelist but the relief of being able to talk
English, and of knowing his name and the title of one of his
books. She began at once to tell him that on the whole her
favourite among his novels was "Instead", because of its
beautiful idealism. She owned, however, that "The Puritan in
Spain" was a more powerful work, though there were some rather
unpleasant passages in it; but she supposed that couldn't be
avoided if the author wanted to describe life as it really was.
She understood that novelists always had to experience personally
the...the sensations they described, and she wanted to know
if his heroine was somebody he'd really known, and if he'd been
through all those love scenes with her. It was ever so much more
exciting to know that the characters in a novel were taken from
real people, and that the things described had actually happened;
even, Mrs. Glaisher added, wrinkling up her innocent eyes, if
they were such naughty things as Mr. Weston wrote about.</p>

<p>Vance's friends had accustomed him to subtler praise, and he
only stared and laughed; but seeing Mrs. Glaisher's bewilderment
he said: "Well, I suppose we do mix up experience and imagination
without always knowing which is which."</p>

<p>Mrs. Glaisher gave him a coy glance. "You won't tell me, then?
You mean to leave us all guessing? What's the use of making a
mystery, as long as you're a free man? I know all about you; do
you suppose I'd be half as interested in your books if I didn't?
I know the kind of life you young men lead; and your ideas about
love, and the rest of it. We society women are not quite such
simpletons as you think. We go around and see--that's what makes
it so exciting to meet you. I know all about your adventures in
Spain...or at least just enough to make me want to hear more..."</p>

<p>Vance reddened uncomfortably. What did she know, what was she
trying to insinuate? Her stupidity was so prodigious that it
struck him that it might be feigned...but a second glance at
her candid countenance reassured him. "I've had plenty of castles
in Spain, but no adventures there," he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Glaisher shook her head incredulously. "When anybody's as
much in the lime-light as you it's no use thinking you can fool
people...But I see the dancing's beginning...I'm coming!"
she signalled to her host, advancing to the armchair he had
pushed forward for her. Half-way she turned back to Vance. "I do
delight in these Bohemian parties, don't you? Won't you give me
one some day? Not a big affair, like this; but Imp and I would
love it if you'd let us pop in to tea alone, and see how a famous
novelist lives when he's at home."</p>

<p>Vance hesitated. Halo always gave him to understand that she
was weary of the world she had grown up in, and particularly of
the New York in which she had figured as Mrs. Lewis Tarrant; but
he had promised her to help out Lorry's party, and he knew the
success of "Factories" might depend on Mrs. Glaisher's enjoyment
of her evening. No doubt Halo would be willing to offer a cup of
tea in such a case; she might even reproach Vance if he made her
miss the chance of doing her brother a good turn.</p>

<p>"I'm sure Mrs. Weston will be very glad...she'll send you
a note," he stammered, embarrassed by the memory of his former
blunders, and of the pain they had caused her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Glaisher swept his face with an astonished eyeglass.
"Mrs. Weston? Really--? I'd no idea...I supposed you were
living alone..."</p>

<p>"No," said Vance curtly.</p>

<p>"Do excuse me. I'm too sorry. I was told you were a
widower...But perhaps you've remarried lately?"</p>

<p>What was the answer to that, Vance wondered, tingling with the
memory of Halo's reproaches. "I supposed of course Spear must
have told you...I'm to be married to his sister...She and I
..." he stopped, his ideas forsaking him under Mrs. Glaisher's
frigid gaze.</p>

<p>"His sister? But he has only one, and she's married already.
Her name is Mrs. Lewis Tarrant. Her husband is in Paris. He's an
old friend of mine; he came to see me only yesterday. Poor
fellow--in spite of all he's been through I understand he has a
horror of divorce...and I don't suppose," Mrs. Glaisher
concluded, rising from the divan with a pinched smile, "that even
in your set a woman can be engaged to one man while she's still
married to another...But please forget my suggestion...
<i>Such</i> a pity, young man, with your talent," Mrs. Glaisher
sighed, as she turned to enthrone herself in the armchair facing
the stage.</p>

<p>Jane Meggs, Lady Pevensey and Kate Brennan grouped themselves
about her, and the rest of the guests crouched on cushions or
squatted cross-legged on the floor. Nevsky, at the piano,
preluded with a flourish of discords, and Sady Lenz suddenly
leapt from behind parted curtains in apparel scant enough to
enlighten the American sculptor as to her plastic possibilities.
Vance heard Mrs. Glaisher give a little gasp; then he turned and
slipped toward the door. As he reached it Lorry Spear's hand fell
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Vance. Not going? What's up? This dancing's rather worth
while; and Mrs. Glaisher wanted me to arrange a little party with
you somewhere next week--I could lend you this place, if you
like."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Mrs. Glaisher has already invited herself to our
quarters; but she backed out when she found she might meet
Halo."</p>

<p>Lorry's brows darkened; then he gave a careless laugh. "Oh,
well, what of that? You know the kind of fool she is. The sort
that runs after <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;e</i> women in foreign
countries, and are scared blue when they meet somebody from home
who doesn't fit into the conventions. Why did you tell her about
Halo?"</p>

<p>Vance stood with his hands in his pockets, staring down at the
dusty studio floor. He raised his head and looked into Lorry's
handsome restless eyes. "You asked Halo to send me here tonight,
didn't you--to help you to amuse Mrs. Glaisher?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. You don't seem to realize that you're one of
our biggest cards. I'm awfully grateful to you--"</p>

<p>"And you told Halo you'd rather she didn't come?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no; I didn't have to. Halo knows how women like Mrs.
Glaisher behave. I'd have been sorry to expose her to it. Not
that she cares--she wouldn't have chucked everything for you if
she had. But see here, Vance, you can't go back on me like this.
For the Lord's sake see me through. Halo promised you would. And
Imp Pevensey wants to talk to you about going to London next
spring and getting launched among the highbrows. You need a
London boom for your books, my dear boy. Damn--what's wrong with
the lights? That fool Heff swore to me he knew how to manage
them..."</p>

<p>Lorry dashed back toward the stage, where Fr&auml;ulein Lenz's
posturing had been swallowed up in darkness. Vance continued to
stand motionless, his mind a turmoil. At length the lights blazed
up, and under cover of the applause at Fr&auml;ulein Lenz's
re-embodiment he made his way out.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c14">XIV</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In the courtyard he stood and looked about him. A cold drizzle
was falling, but he hardly noticed it. His resentment had
dropped. It was no use being angry with Lorry, who took his
advantage where he found it, and thought no harm. What was really
wrong was the situation between Vance and Halo--the ambiguity of
a tie which, apparently, he could neither deny nor affirm without
offending her. What else, for instance, could he have said to
Mrs. Glaisher? How could he have pretended that he was living
alone without seeming to deny his relation with Halo? Yet, by not
doing so, he had subjected her--and himself--to a worse
humiliation.</p>

<p>Such questions would not have arisen if she had obtained her
divorce at once, as they had expected when they left America. But
the months had passed, and Vance (as he now became aware) had
hardly given the matter another thought, had in fact been
reminded of it only at the moment of the scene provoked by his
going alone to the old Marquesa's. He had asked Halo then if they
could not marry soon; she had turned the question with a laugh,
and he had carelessly dismissed it from his mind.</p>

<p>Since then he could not remember having thought of it again
till the night before, in his midnight musings at Fontainebleau.
He had always considered himself as much pledged to Halo as if
the law had bound them, and would have had a short answer for any
one who hinted the contrary; and the question of marriage or
non-marriage had seemed subsidiary. In Lorry Spear's group, and
that of the writers and artists who came to Vance's studio, such
questions were seldom raised, since the social rules they implied
hardly affected the lives of these young people. But now Vance
saw, as he had for a brief instant at Granada, and again at
Fontainebleau, that Halo would never really think and feel as
these people did. She had sacrificed with a light heart her
standing among her own kind; but something deeper than her
prejudices or her convictions, something she could sacrifice to
no one because it was closer to her than reason or passion, made
it impossible for her to feel at ease in the new life she had
chosen. Only yesterday Vance had imagined that jealousy might be
the cause of her disquietude; now he saw it was something far
harder to dispel. Whatever he might do to persuade her of his
devotion, to convince her that no other woman had come between
them, her loneliness would subsist; in their happiest and most
confiding moments it would be there, she would be conscious,
between herself and him, of a void the wider because she knew he
could not measure it.</p>

<p>A word of Mrs. Glaisher's had enlightened him. She had said
that Tarrant (whom she evidently knew well) had a horror of
divorce; and she had doubtless heard this from him recently,
since she had mentioned that he was in Paris, and had been with
her the day before. Tarrant unwilling to divorce--this, then,
must be one of the sources of Halo's preoccupation! Vance
wondered why she had kept it from him; perhaps, poor child,
because she had feared he might feel himself less bound to her if
he knew there was no prospect of their marrying. But that was not
like Halo. More probably she had kept her secret because she was
resolved to let nothing cloud their happiness. It would be like
her to want him to know only the joys of her love, without its
burdens.</p>

<p>Vance had been astonished to hear from Mrs. Glaisher that
Tarrant was in Paris. The situation was full of perplexity. Halo
had often told him that she would never have asked her husband to
set her free, that it was he who had begged her to divorce him,
presumably that he might marry Mrs. Pulsifer. She had never
alluded to any alteration in Tarrant's view; she had never once
referred to the question. No doubt she knew of the change; her
lawyers must surely have advised her of it; and if she had
concealed the fact from Vance it was probably because she knew
its cause, and was herself in some way connected with it. At the
idea the blood rushed to Vance's forehead. Was it not likely that
this man, who was still Halo's husband, had come to Paris
purposely to see her, to try to persuade her to go back to him?
Moody and unstable as he was, he might well have wearied of the
idea of marrying another woman, and begun to pine for Halo, once
he knew he had lost her.</p>

<p>For a moment Vance's heart sank; then he reflected that Mrs.
Glaisher's statement might have been based on the merest hearsay.
Why should Tarrant have confided his views to her? The delay in
the divorce might have been caused by a mere legal technicality,
some point in dispute between opposing lawyers. And to attach any
particular significance to Tarrant's arrival in Paris was absurd.
He belonged to the type of Europeanized American who is equally
at home on both sides of the Atlantic and accustomed to come and
go continually, for pleasure, for business, or simply from the
force of habit.</p>

<p>Vance wandered down Lorry's street and turned into the
Boulevard Raspail. The more he considered the question the less
probable he thought it that Tarrant's presence in Paris had to do
with his divorce. Tarrant never intervened personally when he
could get any one to replace him; whatever his purpose was, he
would probably not wish to meet Halo....But what had he come
for? Vance was seized with a sudden determination to find out.
The time had come when Halo's situation and his own must be
settled, and Tarrant held the key to it.</p>

<p>He walked on through the rain, musing on these problems, and
wishing he could meet Tarrant at once--this very night, before
going home and seeing Halo. If only he had asked Mrs. Glaisher
where Tarrant was staying! It would be easy enough to find out
the next day; but Vance's blood was beating too violently for
delay. He wanted to bring Halo some definite word as to her
divorce; and he determined to try to run Tarrant down at once and
plead with him to release her, if it were really true that he was
no longer disposed to.</p>

<p>As he walked on, wondering where he was likely to come across
Tarrant, Vance recalled Halo's pointing out the hotel where she
and her husband had always stayed in Paris. It was one of the
quiet but discreetly fashionable houses patronized by people who
hate the promiscuity of "Palaces" but cannot do without their
comforts. The hotel, Vance remembered, was not far from the
Boulevard Raspail, and he decided to go there and enquire. He
knew Tarrant's tendency to slip into a rut and shrink from new
contacts, and thought it likely that the hotel people might know
of his whereabouts even if he were not under their roof.</p>

<p>The drizzle had turned to a heavy rain, and when he reached
the street he was in search of the fa&ccedil;ade of the hotel was
reflected from afar in the wet pavement. But within a few yards
of the door Vance paused. Even if Tarrant were staying there, and
were actually there at the moment (it was long past midnight), he
would most probably refuse to receive a visitor. And should Vance
leave a note asking for an appointment, if answered at all, it
would certainly be answered by a refusal. He had worked long
enough under Tarrant in the office of the "New Hour" to be
familiar with his chief's tactics. It was Tarrant's instinct to
retreat from the unknown, the unexpected, to place the first
available buffer between himself and any incident likely to
unsettle his nerves or alter his plans; and if Vance should ask
to be received, the obvious buffer would be his lawyers.</p>

<p>Vance stood irresolute. How on earth was he to get at the man?
If he waited till chance brought them together he knew the
other's adroitness would find a way out. He would cut the scene
short and turn on his heel....The uselessness of any attempt
to reach him seemed so obvious that Vance turned and walked back
toward the Boulevard. He had almost reached it when a taxi
passed, approaching from the opposite direction. As it came
abreast of him a lamp flashed into it, and he saw Tarrant inside.
Vance turned and raced back toward the hotel. The taxi stopped at
the door and Tarrant got out and opened his umbrella before he
began to hunt for his fare. He was in evening dress, and as
perfectly appointed as usual, but in the rainy light he looked
paler and older. Vance hung back till the carefully counted fare
was in the chauffeur's hand; then he went toward the door.</p>

<p>"Tarrant!" he said, "I--I want to speak to you...I
must."</p>

<p>Tarrant turned under his umbrella, and surveyed him with
astonishment. "I don't--" he began; then Vance saw the colour
rush to his pale face. <i>"You?"</i> he said. "I've nothing to
say to you." He started to enter the hotel.</p>

<p>Vance stepped in front of him. "You must let me see you--now,
at once. Do you suppose I'd ask it if it wasn't necessary? Please
listen to me, Tarrant--"</p>

<p>Tarrant paused a moment. Under the umbrella Vance could hardly
see his face, but he caught a repressed tremor in his voice. "You
can write. You can write to my lawyers," he said.</p>

<p>"No! Not to you, and not to your lawyers. You'd turn me down
every time. I've only two words to say, but I'm going to say them
now. I'll say them out here in the street if you don't want me to
come in."</p>

<p>The rain by this time was falling heavily. Vance had no
umbrella, and his thin overcoat was already drenched. Tarrant
looked down nervously at his own glossy evening shoes. "It's
impossible," he said.</p>

<p>"What's impossible? You can't refuse me--"</p>

<p>He saw Tarrant glance toward the illuminated doors of the
hotel, and meet the eyes of the night porter, whose dingy face
peered out at them with furtive curiosity.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you come here at this hour to make a scene
in the street..." Tarrant grumbled over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I won't make it in the street if you'll let me come in. I
don't want to make a scene anyhow. I only want a few minutes'
talk with you; I've got to have it, so we may as well get it
over."</p>

<p>Tarrant looked again at his feet, which were splashed with
mud. "I can't stay out here in this deluge," he began. "If you
insist, you'd better come in; but your forcing yourself on me is
useless...and intolerable..."</p>

<p>He walked up the steps, and Vance followed. The revolving
doors swung open and the two men entered the warm brightly lit
lounge. A few people, evidently just back from the theatre, sat
at little tables, absorbing drinks from tall glasses. Tarrant
turned to the porter. "Is there anybody in the reading-room?" The
porter glanced in, and came back to say that there was a
gentleman there writing letters.</p>

<p>Tarrant seemed to hesitate; then he turned and walked toward
the lift. Vance followed. Tarrant did not look back at him or
speak to him. They entered the lift and stood side by side in
silence while it slowly ascended; when it stopped they got out,
and, still in silence, walked down the dim corridor to a door
which Tarrant unlocked. He turned an electric switch and lit up a
small sitting-room with pale walls and brocaded curtains. Vance
entered after him and shut the door.</p>

<p>Tarrant put down his umbrella. He stood for a moment with his
back to Vance, staring down at the empty hearth. Then he turned
and said: "Well?"</p>

<p>His thin high-nosed face with the sharply cut nostrils was
drawn with distress, and the furrows in his forehead had
deepened; but his gray eyes were now quiet and unwavering. Vance
knew that he had gone through the inevitable struggle with his
impulse of evasion and flight, and that, finding escape
impossible, he had mastered his nerves, and was prepared to play
his part fittingly. Vance felt a secret admiration for the man
whose worldly training had given him this discipline; he knew
what mental and physical distress Tarrant underwent after such an
effort of the will. "Poor devil," he thought..."we're all
poor devils..."</p>

<p>"Well?" Tarrant repeated.</p>

<p>"Well--I want to speak to you about Halo. I want you to tell
me what you intend to do."</p>

<p>Tarrant's face darkened; but in a moment he recovered his
expression of rather disdainful indifference. He took off his hat
and overcoat, and laid them carefully on a table in the corner of
the room; then he turned toward the fireplace and threw himself
down in an armchair. "You'd better sit down," he said, glancing
coldly toward the chair facing him.</p>

<p>Vance paid no heed; not that he resented the invitation, but
because, in his state of acute inner tension, he was hardly aware
that it was addressed to him. Tarrant waited for a moment; then,
as his visitor did not move: "I supposed," he said, "it was for
something of this sort that you'd come, and I can only say again
that it's no use. I should have thought you'd have understood
that what you have to say had better be said to my lawyers."</p>

<p>Vance flushed. "I suppose you think you're bound to answer in
this way; but what use is that either? I've got nothing to say to
your lawyers--or to hear from them. I'm not here to make a row or
a scene. I only want to put you a straight question. I've heard
you've changed your mind about letting Halo divorce you, and I
want to know if it's true. Is it?"</p>

<p>Tarrant sat with his long, delicately-jointed fingers twisted
about the arms of his chair. After a moment he turned slightly,
reached out toward a table near by, and took up a packet of
cigarettes. He drew out a gold-mounted lighter, lit a cigarette,
puffed at it once or twice, and rested his head thoughtfully
against the back of the chair. Vance stood leaning against the
wall, watching every movement of Tarrant's with a sort of
fascinated admiration. He knew that each of those quiet and
seemingly careless gestures was the mask of an inner agitation,
and envied the schooling which had put Tarrant in command of such
a perfectly disciplined set of motions.</p>

<p>At length Tarrant spoke. "When my wife left my house to join
you she must have known that her doing so would make me change my
mind about letting her divorce me."</p>

<p>Vance gave an impatient shrug. It was the tone he had heard so
often at the office, when Tarrant was trying to shake off an
importunate visitor. But he reflected that it was only a
protective disguise assumed to hide the moral disarray of the
real man--as his lighting a cigarette had been done to occupy his
hands, lest Vance should notice their nervous twining about the
chair-arms. And again Vance was filled with a queer pity for his
antagonist.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that, as she's put herself in what's called
the wrong, you're going to refuse to let her get a divorce
against you? Well, it's your technical right, of course. But
there's nothing to prevent your getting a divorce against
<i>her;</i> there'll be no difficulty--" Vance broke off, but
Tarrant made no answer. He sat in the same attitude of resigned
attention, his gaze engrossed with the cigarette-smoke curling up
from his lips. "That's what I came here to ask you; do you mean
to divorce her?" Vance continued.</p>

<p>Tarrant bent forward to shake the ashes of his cigarette onto
the hearth. "Is this--" he began, and then broke off. "Are you
here at--at her request?"</p>

<p>"No. She had no idea I was coming."</p>

<p>"But you think she wished you to?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary--she would probably have done all she could
to stop me. That's why I didn't tell her."</p>

<p>During this interrogatory Tarrant's profile was turned toward
Vance, and the latter noticed that the edge of his thinly cut
nostril was white and drawn up, like that of a man in pain.
"After all, I suppose he did love her once," Vance thought.</p>

<p>Tarrant straightened himself, and moved about so that he faced
Vance. "You might have spared me this intrusion. I can't see what
good you thought it would do. My wife knows I've given up all
idea of divorcing her."</p>

<p>"Or letting her divorce you?"</p>

<p>Tarrant gave a barely audible laugh.</p>

<p>Vance stood silent, still leaning against the wall. The
wetness of his overcoat began to penetrate to his skin, and he
shivered slightly, and pulled the overcoat off. As he did so he
saw Tarrant's colour rise.</p>

<p>"I really don't see," Tarrant said, as though answering
Vance's unconscious gesture in removing his coat, "what can be
gained by any more talk. I've told you what you wanted to
know."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head. "No; it's not enough. You say you don't
want to get a divorce. But I don't suppose you've forgotten that
not much more than a year ago it was you who asked your wife to
set you free? It was then that she left you; not till then."</p>

<p>Tarrant stood up, and took a few steps across the room and
back. His eyes fell on Vance's wet overcoat, and on the
shoulder-blades to which his dress-coat damply clung. "You're wet
through," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Never mind that. I want to talk this thing out with you. You
admit that when Halo left you it was because you asked her to;
because you wanted to be free. And now you turn round and say you
don't want to be free any longer, and therefore won't let her be
either. Isn't that it?"</p>

<p>Tarrant went to a small upright cabinet between the windows.
He took from it a bottle of brandy and a glass, and pouring water
into the glass added some brandy and drank it down. "I'm subject
to chills; my feet are very wet." He turned to Vance with a cold
smile. "I'm not as young as you are..." The restless colour
rose to his face again and he added, with a hesitating gesture
toward the bottle: "Will you--?"</p>

<p>Vance made a sign of refusal, and Tarrant, as though
regretting his suggestion, drew his lips together, and stood
upright, his hands thrust into his pockets.</p>

<p>"And now you say you don't want to be free, and won't let her
be," Vance persisted. "Is that so, or isn't it?"</p>

<p>Tarrant cleared his throat. "It is so--as far as the external
facts go. As to my private motives...you'll excuse my keeping
them to myself..."</p>

<p>Vance uttered a despairing sigh. Again and again in his short
life he had come upon this curious human inability, in moments of
the deepest stress, to shake off the conventional attitude and
the accepted phrase. The man opposite him, whose distress he
recognized and could not help pitying, seemed to be struggling in
vain to express his real self, in its helpless vanity,
humiliation and self-deception. The studied attitude of composure
which gave him a superficial advantage over an untutored
antagonist was really only another bondage. When a man had
disciplined himself out of all impulsiveness he stood powerless
on the brink of the deeper feelings. If only, Vance thought, he
could help Tarrant to break through those bonds! There must be a
word that would work this miracle, if he could find it. Above
all, he reminded himself, he must try not to be angry or
impatient.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he began, "you feel you've got a right to talk
like that. From the point of view of society, or civilized
behavior, or whatever you call it, you may be right. But what's
the use of it? I'm not trying to offend you, or to butt in where
I don't belong. Your wife has left you; she's under my care; how
can you blame me for wanting to make things easier for her? When
she came to me she thought you wanted to marry another woman...
."</p>

<p>"If I did," Tarrant broke in, "it may have been because she
had made my home...no longer what it should have been..."</p>

<p>Vance felt a new wave of discouragement. There they were, back
again in the old verbal entanglements. "I wonder how many
people--husbands or wives either--make their homes what they
should have been? It doesn't seem as if they often pulled it off.
But I don't pretend it's my business to come here and talk to you
about your wife..."</p>

<p>"Ah, you admit that?" Tarrant sneered.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'm here to talk to you about the woman I want to
take for a wife myself. There's a big gap between the two.
Whoever made the gap, or whatever made it, what does it matter
now?" He paused a moment to control his voice, and then added:
"See here, Tarrant, it's hell to see a woman suffering because
you can't give her the place in your life that she ought to
have...That's what I came here to tell you..."</p>

<p>Tarrant walked away again, and then came back to the hearth.
He raised his elbow against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"In my opinion she ought to suffer," he said.</p>

<p>"Why--because you do?" Tarrant was silent, and Vance pressed
on: "There's such a lot of suffering everywhere; what's the use
of adding to it? For God's sake, can't we both put aside the
personal question and tackle this as if it was just any ordinary
human predicament? The happiest people, somehow, aren't any too
happy...and I can't see that making them more miserable ever
made things pleasanter for the other party...at least not
beyond the minute when he's doing it."</p>

<p>Tarrant's face had whitened. He did not immediately reply; but
at last he said, in a tone of elaborate politeness: "I suppose I
ought to be very much obliged to you for your advice--though I
didn't ask for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. You can turn what I say into a sermon, and try
to laugh me out of it, if you choose. Only I don't see the use of
that either."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Tarrant. "Neither do I see the use of your
forcing yourself in on me."</p>

<p>"But, my God, all the use in the world--if only I can make you
understand! Can't you see the misery it is not to be able to give
Halo the standing and the name she's got a right to? That woman
tonight--that Mrs. Glaisher--insulted her. How can I stand by and
see her treated as if she wasn't fit to be touched by the very
people who used to grovel to get asked to her house?"</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> house," Tarrant interrupted ironically.</p>

<p>Vance's hopes sank. Up to that moment it had seemed to him
that he might yet find a crack in the surface of the other's icy
pride; now he had exhausted his last argument and knew that he
had made no impression. "That's all you've got to say to me?"</p>

<p>Tarrant remained silent; Vance saw his lips twitch with the
effort to control his temper. "I've never had anything to say to
you," he replied.</p>

<p>Vance continued to lean against the door-jamb. The growing
distress in Tarrant's face seemed to belie the bravado of his
words. He knew all the accepted formulas; but as he recited them
Vance saw that they no longer corresponded with what he was
feeling--with the agony of envy, jealousy and resentment battling
together in his soul. And Vance, who knew exactly what he himself
wanted to say, did not know how to say it because he was ignorant
of the language in which men of Tarrant's world have been
schooled to disguise their thoughts. Here they stood, he
reflected, two poor devils caught in the coil of human
incomprehension; but the fact that he felt the pity of it, and
that Tarrant did not, gave him an advantage over the other. From
the moment when Vance understood this he became sure of himself,
and unperturbed. "God," he thought, "when I go away and leave him
how cold he'll feel inside of himself!"</p>

<p>He moved impulsively toward Tarrant. "See here, I daresay I
don't know how to put things the right way...the way you're
used to...But don't let that count against me. Don't think of
you and me; think only of Halo. If there's anything I can do to
persuade you to give her her freedom, tell me, and I'll try to do
it. I suppose I haven't got what people in your crowd call pride;
anyhow, the kind I have got don't count at a time like this. If
there's anything I can say or do--short of giving her up--that
would make you change your feelings about her, I'll do it now,
this very minute. God, Tarrant--don't let me go away feeling I've
done no good! Why should people go on hating each other because
once in their lives their wants and wishes may have crossed? If
you send me away now it isn't me you'll hate afterward--it's
yourself."</p>

<p>Tarrant had moved to the farther end of the hearth. As if to
give a motive to his withdrawal he took the packet of cigarettes
from the mantel and lit another. "I really haven't anything more
to say," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Except that you won't divorce."</p>

<p>"Certainly I won't divorce."</p>

<p>"Not on any condition?"</p>

<p>"Not on any condition."</p>

<p>Vance stood in the middle of the room and looked at him. "I
can remember when I used to think he was a great fellow," he
thought.</p>

<p>He turned away and picked up his drenched overcoat. It had
left a dark pool of moisture on the light damask of the chair he
had thrown it on, and the velvet pile of the carpet beneath.
Tarrant looked gray and ghastly, standing alone between the
illuminated wall-brackets of that frivolous room.</p>

<p>"Ah--you poor man," Vance thought, as he turned and left
him.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c15">XV</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo, after Vance's return from Fontainebleau, felt the
reaction that follows on a period of inward distress. When she
recalled the desperate paths her imagination had travelled she
shivered; but looking back at them from safety made the future
seem more radiant.</p>

<p>How unworthy, she thought, for the lover and comrade of an
artist to yield to such fears--and a comrade was what she most
wanted to be. Women who cast in their lot with great men, with
geniuses, even with the brilliant dreamers whose dreams never
take shape, should be armed against emotional storms and terrors.
Over and over again she told herself that her joys were worth the
pain, that the pain was part of the rapture; but such theories
shrivelled to nothing in the terror that had threatened her very
life. If she were going to lose her lover--if she had already
lost him--she could only tremble and suffer like other women.
Everybody was reduced to the same abject level by the big
primitive passions, love and jealousy and hunger; the delicate
distinctions and differences with which security adorned them
vanished in the storm of their approach.</p>

<p>Then Vance came back; and as soon as he appeared her fear was
lifted. He had not been with another woman; he had gone off to
think over his book. Her first look in his eyes convinced her
that he had not deceived her; and instantly she swore to herself
that never again, by word or glance, would she betray resentment
or curiosity concerning his comings and goings. Whenever he
wanted to get away she would accept his disappearance without
surprise. Her yoke should be so light, her nearness so pleasant,
that when he came back it should never be because he felt obliged
to, but because he was happier with her than elsewhere. New
strength and cunning seemed to grow in her as she held him in her
arms that night.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The morning after Lorry's banquet Vance went out early; he had
already left the house when Halo woke. She was not sorry to be
alone; she had not yet finished typing the manuscript he had
brought back from Fontainebleau, and as soon as she had dressed,
and given the <i>bonne</i> the orders for the day, she returned
to her task. The hours passed in a flash, and she was still
trying to unravel the tangled manuscript when she heard his
latchkey.</p>

<p>"What--lunch already?" she exclaimed, without lifting her
head. He made no answer, and when she stopped typing and looked
up at him she was startled by the change in his face.</p>

<p>"Why, Vance, how tired you look--aren't you well?" she
exclaimed. And instantly the little serpent of jealousy reared
its sharp head again in her breast. Through her sleep, in the
small hours, she had heard Vance unlock the door, coming back
from Lorry's feast, as she supposed; but after all, how did she
know? It was nearly daylight when the sound of his latchkey had
waked her. What more likely than that one of the women at Lorry's
had taken him home with her after the party? Would there never
again be any peace for her heart, Halo wondered?</p>

<p>Vance stood silently looking down on her. At length he came up
and laid his arm over her shoulder. "Look here, Halo--" he said
in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she questioned, her own voice sounding to her as odd
and uncertain as his. "<i>Now</i>--!" she thought with a tremor
of apprehension...</p>

<p>Vance continued to look at her. "I know why you sent me alone
to Lorry's last night. It was because you knew those New York
women would be rude to you. Wasn't that it?"</p>

<p>She returned his look in surprise; then the weight slipped
from her heart, and she almost laughed. "Why, darling, how
absurd! I've always hated big dinners...and I'm so fed up
with that crowd at Lorry's."</p>

<p>"Yes; so am I."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you can't blame me for not going."</p>

<p>"I blame you for not telling me why you wouldn't go. Lorry
told me. He said Mrs. Glaisher didn't want to meet you because
you've left your husband and are living with me."</p>

<p>Halo drew back from his arm to smile up at him. "Why, you
ridiculous boy! I daresay he's right. Mrs. Glaisher cut me the
other day when I met her at Lorry's door. Oh, deliberately--it
was such a funny sensation! It amused me so much that I meant to
tell you; but I forgot all about it."</p>

<p>"It doesn't amuse me," said Vance with lowering forehead. "Do
you suppose I want to associate with people who think you're not
good enough for them? She asked if she could come here to tea
with some of her precious friends, and when I told her you were
with me she had the impudence to say she hadn't known, and of
course in that case she couldn't come. Before I left I told Lorry
what I thought about his asking me without you."</p>

<p>Halo was still laughing and looking up into his eyes. "But,
Vanny, it was I who urged Lorry to ask you, because he said the
Glaisher and Lady Pevensey were dying to meet the author of 'The
Puritan in Spain'; and I thought if he got you to come it might
induce Mrs. Glaisher to help him with his ballet."</p>

<p>"I don't care a damn about Lorry's ballet--"</p>

<p>"Well, I do; and I'm very sorry you didn't invite Mrs.
Glaisher here. Think what fun for me to hide behind the curtains,
and hear what fashionable ladies say to a rising novelist! I
begin to think you've lost your sense of humour..."</p>

<p>But she saw that such pleasantries only perplexed him. For a
long while he had not understood her sensitiveness about her
position; but now that some one had taken advantage of it to
slight her he was ablaze with resentment. She put her hand over
his. "Vance--as if anything mattered but you and me!"</p>

<p>"Everything matters to me that's about you. I should think
you'd see how I feel." He walked up and down the room with
agitated steps. "I don't understand your being so offended about
that old woman in Granada whom you'd never seen; and now, when
your own brother, and people you used to know, behave as if it
was a disgrace to meet you, you just sit and laugh."</p>

<p>Her eyes followed him tenderly. "But don't you see that it's
simply because being with you has made everything else seem of no
consequence?"</p>

<p>He came back and sat down by her, his brow still gloomy.
"That's it...that's why it makes my blood boil to think that
when people treat you like that I have to sit by and hold my
tongue. I thought of course we should have been married by this
time. And I want you to know I've done all I could."</p>

<p>Halo felt a tremor of joy rush through her. "But I know,
darling...of course I know..."</p>

<p>"I went to see Tarrant last night--" Vance continued.</p>

<p>She interrupted him with an exclamation of astonishment.
"Lewis? Do you mean to say Lewis is in Paris?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought perhaps you knew. That Glaisher woman told me.
And she said he'd never let you have a divorce; he didn't approve
of divorce, she said. I didn't believe her, because you'd always
told me he wanted to get married himself, and I thought she just
said it to spite me. But I was bound I'd get at the truth, and so
I hunted him down at his hotel last night, and made him listen to
me."</p>

<p>"Last night? You mean to say you were with Lewis last
night?"</p>

<p>He nodded silently, and the unexpectedness of the announcement
struck Halo silent also. She had not heard that Lewis Tarrant was
in Paris, or indeed in Europe; and the shock of learning that he
was in the same place as herself, and that only a few hours
earlier, all unsuspected by her, her husband and her lover had
been talking her over, silenced every other emotion. The vision
of that scene--which, a moment ago, would have appeared too
improbable to call up any definite picture--seized painfully on
her imagination. It seemed to her that she was gazing at herself
stripped and exposed, between these two men who were disputing
for her possession.</p>

<p>"See here, Halo--you're not angry with me, are you? I couldn't
help trying to see him," she heard Vance pleading; and dropping
the hands she had raised to her face she turned to him.</p>

<p>"Vanny! Angry? How could I be? Only I don't see...what in
the world made you think..."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I did think. I felt I had to see him." Her
eyes filled, and he hurried on nervously: "Yes, but it was no
good. I suppose I ought to have known it wouldn't be. He and I
never could talk to each other long without one of us getting
mad, or both."</p>

<p>She looked up in alarm. "You don't mean to say you had a
quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; that isn't his way. We just kept on getting politer
and politer."</p>

<p>"Ah--" she breathed, and covered her eyes again. If only the
pressure of her hands could blot out the vision he called up, the
vision of Tarrant rigid and sneering, of Vance bewildered,
passionate and helpless! She thought: "My darling--he's wrecked
my last chance of freedom...and how I love him for it!"</p>

<p>But in a moment she recovered her self-control. "You must tell
me just what happened, dear." She drew him down to the chair
beside her, and quietly, her hand in his, listened to what he
told her, weighing every phrase, every syllable, the meaning of
which she knew he had only half-guessed, while to her it lay bare
to the roots. She had seen at once that any influence she might
still have had over Tarrant must have been forfeited by Vance's
rash intervention. Tarrant would never believe that she had not
known of it, and his disgust at a proceeding so tactless and
indelicate would be aggravated by the idea that she had connived
at it, perhaps even prompted it. She could hear him say, with the
lift of the nostril that marked his strongest disapproval:
"Things aren't done in that way between civilized people." It was
his final form of condemnation.</p>

<p>She knew that Tarrant never forgave any one who wounded his
vanity and tortured his nerves by forcing from him a definite
statement on a question he was tacitly determined to ignore, and
when Vance ended she sat silent, overcome by the probable
consequences of his blunder. But she felt that he might
misinterpret her silence, and she faltered out: "I suppose of
course he thought I'd sent you."</p>

<p>"Well, he did at first; but I told him you didn't know
anything about my coming."</p>

<p>She gave a nervous laugh. "Naturally he didn't believe
that."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he believe it?"</p>

<p>Her impulse was to say: "Because he wanted a better reason for
hating me--" but she suppressed the retort. "When he's angry he
never listens to what any one says," she answered vaguely.</p>

<p>"But why is he so angry? He wouldn't answer me when I asked
him that."</p>

<p>"You asked him--?"</p>

<p>"I reminded him that it was he who originally wanted you to
divorce him."</p>

<p>"Ah--but there's nothing he hates so much as to be reminded of
things he's finished with!"</p>

<p>Vance, who had stood looking down on her with gathering
perplexity, turned away, and began to wander up and down the
room. "I see you think I've made a colossal blunder," he said at
length. She could not think of anything to say, and he went on:
"I ought to have consulted you first, I suppose."</p>

<p>She took his hand. "If you had I certainly wouldn't have let
you expose yourself to anything so painful."</p>

<p>"And so useless? I know what you're thinking. There might have
been a chance of his coming round if I'd let things alone...
and now there's none. That's it, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. For the present, at any rate. But what does it
matter? Do you mind, dearest--our not being married?" she asked
suddenly, laying her hands beseechingly on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes; I hate it--I hate it every minute!" he burst out. "At
first I didn't see what it meant for you--it was enough for me
that you and I were together. But now I wouldn't for the world
have you go through again what you've had to endure this last
year."</p>

<p>She drew back, wrinkling up her eyes in the way she knew he
liked, and smiling up into his face. "How do you know, dearest,
that all I've endured hasn't been a part of our happiness?"</p>

<p>"Not mine--not mine!" he exclaimed impatiently. "It's poisoned
everything for me; and last night that woman made me wild. That's
why I couldn't wait another minute. And now I see my doing what I
did was all a monstrous mistake." He turned away and resumed his
agitated pacing of the room. She wondered if he still had
something on his mind, and what it could be; but after the shock
of what he had told her she had no heart to question him further.
After all, she knew the worst now, and must try to come to terms
with that first...</p>

<p>Presently he came and sat down beside her. "Halo--there's one
thing I've got to ask you. You'll hate it, maybe; but I want you
to give me a straight answer. Tarrant says you've known all along
about his having refused to get a divorce. Is that so?"</p>

<p>She made a sign of assent, and he went on: "Then--then; this
is what I want you to tell me. Hasn't he refused because he's
trying to get you back?"</p>

<p>She gave a start of surprise, and the blood rushed to her
forehead. "Why, Vance, what an idea! You must be crazy..."</p>

<p>"Why not? I thought of it the minute I'd left him. The man was
in agony; I could see that. He couldn't have hated me so if he
hadn't still been in love with you."</p>

<p>"But, darling, I swear to you--"</p>

<p>He gave a shrug. "Oh, I daresay he hasn't said anything yet.
He's feeling his way...trying to think of some dodge that'll
save his face...But I'm sure of it, Halo, I'm sure of it!"</p>

<p>She smiled at his boyish violence. "Well--and what of it?"</p>

<p>"What of it? Nothing, of course. Unless--Look here, Halo,
we've been together over a year now. When we went away I thought
we'd be married in a few months; I wouldn't have dared to urge
you to come if I hadn't been sure of it. And now there seems no
hope of your being free; and I see what a bad turn I did you,
persuading you to go off before things were settled. It's too
late to mend that; the harm's done. But what I want to say is
this--"</p>

<p>Halo sprang up, a new apprehension catching at her heart. "Yes
...yes...you want to say...?"</p>

<p>"I want to say that you're free...free as air..."</p>

<p>She gave him a long look, and then broke into a little laugh.
"Free to go back to Lewis if he'll have me? Is that what you
mean? I'm much obliged to you!"</p>

<p>His head drooped, and he looked away from her. "I mean, of
course, free to do what you like."</p>

<p>There was a silence, during which neither looked at the
other.</p>

<p>"If it comes to that, we're both free," Halo said at last, in
a low voice. Vance was still silent, and she repeated
insistently: "We're both free. Is that what you're trying to tell
me? I've always understood it, I assure you!" The words were
hardly spoken when she saw how they betrayed the dread she had
determined to hide from him; but already she was being swept away
on its current. "Ah, you make me too unhappy--too unhappy!" she
burst out, and suddenly her hard anguish was loosened, and she
fell with long sobs on his breast. "Vanny, Vanny...I've never
loved you as I do now!" she heard herself crying; and felt far
off, through the streaming flood of her fears, his hand quietly
pushing back her hair.</p>

<h1>XVI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>From the balcony of the little pink house Vance Weston looked
out over a shabby garden and a barrier of palms to a bay between
plum-blue headlands.</p>

<p>On this particular day the bay palpitated with glittering
cubes of purple and azure that the waves tossed back and forth
like mermaids playing with their jewels. To Vance these games of
wind and water were a ceaseless joy. He was always leaving his
work to watch the waves race in from the open sea, dodge past the
guardian promontories, and fall crying on the beach below his
balcony--those unquiet waves, perpetually escaping from
something; cloud-shadows and sun-javelins, the silver bullets of
the rain, the steady drive of the west wind's flails. There were
other days, very different, when they were not in flight, but
like immense grazing flocks moved backward and forward over their
smooth pastures to a languid secret rhythm; when a luminous
indistinctness falsified the distances, and the wild bay became a
placid land-locked sheet of water. Divine days too; but not as
inspiriting as those of flight and pursuit, or as exciting as
those when the storm caught the frightened waves and turned their
hollows livid as the olive trees along the shore.</p>

<p>Vance laid down his pen and went out on the balcony. Coming up
the path of the adjoining Pension Britannique, between untrimmed
tea-roses and tough-leaved yuccas, was the perpendicular form of
the eldest Miss Plummet. Her hand, cased in a black glove worn
blue at the seams, clutched a string bag, through the interstices
of which were visible some books from the English Chapel library,
a bottle from the chemist's, a handful of mandarins and a tiny
bunch of faded anemones. Miss Plummet was almost as fascinating
to Vance as the sea and the headlands. She represented, in all
its angular purity, a vision as new and exotic: the English
maiden lady whose life is spent in continental pensions kept by
English landladies, and especially recommended by the local
English chaplain. The type was familiar to Halo, so much of whose
girlhood had been lived in continental pensions; but to Vance it
was more novel and exciting than anything that Montparnasse could
offer. "She's got an outline, an edge; she's representative. And
what she represents is so colossal," he would explain to Halo,
pressing her for further elucidations about the kind of life that
Miss Plummet's family probably led at home, the kind of house she
came out of, her background, her conception of the universe.</p>

<p>The passing of Miss Plummet always told Vance what time it
was. Precisely at three every afternoon she returned from her
shopping in the one narrow street of Oubli-sur-Mer, the little
Mediterranean town curving its front of blotched pink-and-yellow
houses along the harbour crammed with fishing-boats and guarded
by a miniature jetty. Oubli-sur-Mer (Halo had explained, when she
proposed to him that they should go there for the winter) was a
queer survival: a pocket past which, since the war, fashion and
money, jazz and cinemas, had swept eastward, leaving stranded in
this dent of the coast, hemmed in by rusty pine-clad hills, the
remnant of an old-fashioned English colony. The colonists were
annually fewer, a dying race; but though the group had dwindled
it held the more jealously to its habits and traditions, its
English chaplain, English doctor, chemist, parish library, its
sacred horror of "French ways", and inability to understand the
humour of "what French people call funny".</p>

<p>But Vance never could give the proper amount of attention to
Miss Plummet, for almost immediately after she had vanished into
the interior of the Pension Britannique there always emerged from
it Mrs. Dorman, the chaplain's wife. Mrs. Dorman was spreading
where Miss Plummet was vertical, ambling where the other was
brisk. She belonged to the generation which had known the south
of France to possess a warm winter climate, and her large mild
face looked forth astonished under a spreading straw hat wreathed
with a discouraged dust-coloured feather, while she grasped a
sun-umbrella in one hand and with the other tightened her fur
tippet. Vance called her the regional divinity because her dual
precautions against the weather so aptly symbolized the extremes
of temperature experienced at Oubli-sur-Mer in passing from sun
to shade.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the winter climate of the Riviera is not what it
used to be; in old times we never <i>dreamed</i> of covering up
the Bougainvilleas," Mrs. Dorman would invariably proclaim to new
arrivals at the pension, to the distress of her landlady, Madame
Fleuret, who was the widow of a French Protestant <i>pasteur,</i>
but herself unassailably English. "If only," Madame Fleuret
privately complained, "she'd leave the new people alone till
they've settled down, and made up their minds to have their
letters sent here"--a view in which the Reverend Mr. Dorman
heartily concurred. "But you know, dear Madame Fleuret, the
Bishop <i>did</i> agree with me," Mrs. Dorman would gently
protest, thereby recalling to Madame Fleuret's irritated memory
the disastrous visit of the Bishop of Drearbury. His lordship,
having been ordered south by his physicians for a rest, and
having singled out the Pension Britannique after protracted
correspondence with Lady Dayes-Dawes, had arrived on a
<i>mistral</i> day, when the olive trees were turned inside out,
the gale screaming down the chimneys, and the fire smoking
furiously in what Madame Fleuret had lately been trained to call
the "lounge"; and it was at that disastrous moment that Mrs.
Dorman had put her stereotyped question: "We do so hope you're
going to like the Riviera?" to which the Bishop, whom Mr. Dorman
had just brought back from a good long walk in the teeth of the
gale, had hissed out: "I'm afraid I don't like your foliage."
("If at least," Madame Fleuret said afterward confidentially to
the other ladies, "Mrs. Dorman would give them time to get used
to the olives! It took me <i>years,</i> I know; and there's no
use trying to hurry people.")</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorman, Vance knew, was on her way to sit with Mrs.
Churley, the wife of the retired Indian cavalry officer who lived
up the hill. Colonel Churley, a long melancholy mahogany-coloured
man with a drooping white moustache, and white rings under his
pale blue eyes, walked past the pink house every morning to fetch
his letters from the post office, and every afternoon to take a
long tramp by himself along the shore or among the hills. He
walked slowly, his arms clasped behind his back, his walking
stick dragging through the dust, and looked neither to right nor
left, but kept his stern eyes, under projecting shaggy brows,
fixed steadily ahead of him, as if to avoid being accosted by
acquaintances. Only when he met the Reverend Mr. Dorman, the
short round chaplain, whose face was as rubicund as the other's
was dark, did Colonel Churley stop for a few words before
resuming his mournful tramp. Mrs. Churley, crippled with
rheumatism and half blind, lay all day on her sofa at Les
Mimosas, the dismal-looking house up the hill, and Mrs. Dorman
and Miss Plummet took turns to sit with her during her husband's
solitary rambles. Halo had offered to share their task, but Mrs.
Dorman had explained, with some embarrassment, that the Churleys
were very shy and unsociable, and perhaps it would be
best...though Mrs. Weston was so very kind...and she would of
course give the message...but Mrs. Weston mustn't think it
odd...even dear Lady Dayes-Dawes had never been allowed to call...</p>

<p>There was a Churley son, it appeared, a youth also said to be
invalidish and unsociable; Vance had not yet seen him, but at
times he was haunted by the thought that a young fellow, perhaps
younger than himself, lived in that dreary house up the lane, in
a place as lacking in youthful life as Oubli-sur-Mer. Mrs. Dorman
had told Halo that young Churley was said to be "literary," and
the ladies of the Pension Britannique shook their heads when he
was mentioned, as if small good was to be hoped of any one with
such tendencies. The ladies had been shy of Vance too when they
learned he was an author; but Halo had had the happy thought of
giving the parish library a copy of "Instead", his romantic early
novel, and Miss Pamela Plummet, the invalid, who ranked as the
leading literary critic of Oubli-sur-Mer, had pronounced it very
pretty; after which, reassured, the Pension Britannique had taken
"Mr. and Mrs. Weston" to its bosom.</p>

<p>The pension had made the acquaintance of the newcomers through
the accident of their sudden arrival. Halo and Vance, after the
latter's encounter with Lewis Tarrant, had both felt the desire
to get away from Paris; and Halo, with her usual promptness, had
remembered the obsolete charms of Oubli-sur-Mer, got hold of some
one who knew a house-agent there, and secured the little pink
house after one glance at its fly-blown photograph. A week later
they had packed up and evacuated the Paris flat; but their
arrival in the south had been too precipitate for Halo to engage
servants in advance. The restaurants on the quay were too far
off, and the nearness of the Pension Britannique prompted her to
seek its hospitality. It was against Madame Fleuret's principles
to receive boarders from outside; she was opposed to transients
of any kind. Her established clients, she explained, did not like
to be brought in contact with strangers, people you couldn't tell
anything about, and who might turn out to be "foreigners", or
even "peculiar". But Halo's persuasiveness, and the good looks
and good humour of the young couple, had broken down her rule,
and for a week Vance and Halo had been suffered to lunch and dine
at the pension. It was then that Vance had laid in his store of
impressions; had listened, fascinated, to the literary judgments
of the invalid Miss Plummet on "The First Violin" and "Ships that
Pass in the Night" (her favourite works of fiction); had gazed
spell-bound on the mushroom hats and jet-beaded mantle of old
Lady Dayes-Dawes, the baronet's widow, who knew more knitting and
crochet stitches than any one else at Oubli, and whose first
cousin was a Colonial Governor; had hung delighted on the
conversation of the Honourable Ginevra Hipsley, who kept white
mice on whose sensibilities she experimented by means of
folk-songs accompanied by the accordion, and about whom she wrote
emotional letters to "Nature" and the "Spectator"; had followed
the Reverend Mr. Dorman's discreet attempts to ascertain if "Mr.
and Mrs. Weston" belonged to the American branch of the Church of
England (as their distinguished appearance made him hope) and
would therefore be disposed to assist in the maintenance of the
Bougainvillea-draped chapel in which he officiated, or whether
they were members of one of the innumerable sects which so
deplorably diversify the religious life of the States; and had
gathered various items of information about the melancholy
Churley family and the other British residents of
Oubli-sur-Mer.</p>

<p>It was a little world seemingly given over to illness, poverty
and middle-age; and the contrast between the faded faces and
vanished hopes of its inhabitants and the boisterous setting of
sun and gale that framed their declining days would have been
depressing if Vance had not felt in them a deep-down solidarity
of tastes and principles. It was enough that they all read the
"Times", and did not like vegetables cooked in the French way; in
the rootless drifting world into which Vance had been born he had
never (even among Halo's friends and family) come across such a
solid coral-isle of convictions. This little handful of people,
elderly, disappointed and poor, forced by bad health or lack of
means to live away from their country, drifting from pension to
pension, or from one hired villa to another, with interests
limited to the frugal and the trivial, yet managed by sheer
community of sentiment to fit into the pattern of something big
and immemorial. The sense of the past awakened in Vance by his
first sight of the Willows, that queer old house on the Hudson
which embodied a past so recent, now stirred in him more deeply
at the sight of these detached and drifting fragments of so great
a whole. It was odd, he thought, looking back: he hadn't felt
Chartres, yet he felt Miss Plummet and Colonel Churley. Perhaps
even Halo wouldn't have understood how it was that, seen from
Euphoria, these human monuments seemed the more venerable.</p>

<p>Vance stood on the balcony and lit a cigarette. Behind him was
his writing-table, scattered with the loose sheets of "Colossus";
before him, the joyous temptation of sun and sea. In the next
room he heard the diligent click of Halo's Remington, re-copying
the third version of Chapter VII. The work wasn't going as well
as he had hoped; he thought enviously of the pace at which he had
reeled off "The Puritan in Spain" the previous winter at Cadiz.
What he was at now, of course, was a different matter; no glib
tale, but a sort of compendium of all that life had given
him--and received from him. He was attempting to transcribe the
sum total of his experience, to do a human soul, his soul, in the
round. At times, when his inspiration flagged, he told himself
ironically that it looked as though he hadn't had enough
experience to fill many pages. Yet there were days when a grain
of mustard-seed, like an Indian conjuror's tree, would suddenly
shoot up and scale the sky. He stood on the balcony, thinking
restlessly of the sound of the wind in the pines along the shore,
of the smell of lavender and sage on the hot slopes behind the
town, and watching for the figure of Colonel Churley, gloomily
silhouetted against the dazzling bay. If Miss Plummet were a
moment late Vance could always put his watch right by Colonel
Churley.</p>

<p>"Ready for the next!" Halo called.</p>

<p>"Yes. All right..." Ah, there the Colonel was, dragging his
stick along behind him, punctual and desolate as a winter night.
In another moment he would probably meet Mr. Dorman, and Vance
would watch their two faces, one blankly melancholy, the other
a-twitter with animation. But today Mr. Dorman was not visible,
and Colonel Churley strode on, aiming for the hills. Vance
shivered and turned indoors.</p>

<p>"All right. Only I'm afraid there's nothing more coming," he
said.</p>

<p>As Halo looked up he saw a shade of disappointment cross her
face and transform itself into a smile. "Another holiday?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it. I believe it's the sea," he said with a
shrug.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better go out and spend the rest of the day with
it."</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway, irresolute. "Come along?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I will. I want to go over the first chapters
again."</p>

<p>"What a life for you!"</p>

<p>She laughed. "Do I look as if I minded?"</p>

<p>"No. That's what's so trying about you..."</p>

<p>They laughed together, and Vance swung joyously down the
stairs.</p>

<p>The little house was full of a friendly shabby gaiety. Halo
always managed to give that air to their improvised habitations.
On the ground floor, where the kitchen and dining-room were, she
had hidden the dingy papering of the hall under a gay striped
cotton, and had herself repainted and cushioned the tumbledown
chairs in the verandah. Vance's craving for order and harmony was
always subtly gratified by this exercise of her skill. He
recalled with a shudder the chronic disorder in which he had
struggled through the weary years of his marriage, the untidy
lair into which poor Laura Lou converted every room she lived in,
the litter of unmended garments, half-empty medicine bottles and
leaking hot-water bags that accumulated about her as
lavender-scented linen, fresh window-curtains, flowers and books
did about Halo--poor Laura Lou, who could never touch a fire
without making it smoke, while Halo's clever hands could coax a
flame from the sulkiest log.</p>

<p>Vance, thinking of all this, and of the golden freedom
awaiting him outside, recalled another day as bright and
beckoning, when he had fled from the squalid Westchester
bungalow, and the monotony of Laura Lou's companionship, to
wander in the woods and dream of a book he was never to write. He
thought of the incredible change in his fortunes since then, of
the love and understanding and success which had come to him
together, and wondered why mercies of which he was so exquisitely
aware had never yet stifled his old aching interrogation of life.
He was glad to be at Oubli-sur-Mer, away from the incessant
stimulus of Paris, in the country quiet which seemed a necessity
to his creative mood. The queer little community, so
self-contained and shut off from his own agitated world, gave him
the sense of aloofness which his spirit needed; yet somehow--as
so often before--the fulness of the opportunity seemed to oppress
him, his work lagged under the very lack of obstacles.</p>

<p>He picked up his stick and cap, and was just emerging from the
verandah when a young man who walked with a slight limp pushed
open the garden gate. The visitor, a stranger to Vance, came
toward him with an air of rather jaunty self-confidence. He had a
narrow dusky face, with an unexpected crop of reddish hair
streaked with amber tumbling over a broad forehead, and dark eyes
with the look of piercing wistfulness that sometimes betrays
spinal infirmity. A brilliant crimson tie, and a loudly
patterned, but faded pull-over above a pair of baggy flannel
trousers, completed his studied make-up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weston? Would you give me an interview? I don't mean for
a newspaper," the young man began abruptly, in a cultivated but
slightly strident voice. "I've been asked to do an article for
the 'Windmill', and I'd be awfully glad if you'd let me talk with
you for a few minutes."</p>

<p>Vance stood still in the path considering his visitor. He was
not particularly interested in the idea of being interviewed or
reviewed. From the outset of his literary career he had been
unusually indifferent to the notoriety attained by personal
intervention. He remembered the shock he had received, when he
was reviewing for Lewis Tarrant on the "New Hour", on discovering
the insatiable greed for publicity of such successful novelists
as Gratz Blemer. It was not that Vance was indifferent to
success, but because its achievement seemed to him so entirely
independent of self-advertising. Halo abounded in this view,
partly (he suspected) from disgust at what she had seen of the
inner workings of the "New Hour", partly from an inborn disdain
of any sort of cheap popularity. She wanted him to be the
greatest novelist who had ever lived, and was still (Vance felt
sure) gloriously certain of his eventually reaching that
pinnacle; but she cared not a rush for the fame cooked up in
editorial kitchens. As for Vance, though he had to the full the
artist's quivering sensitiveness to praise, and anguished
shrinking from adverse criticism, he felt neither praise or blame
unless it implied recognition of what he had been striving for.
Random approbation had never, even in the early days, perceptibly
raised his pulse; and his first taste of popularity had only made
him more fastidious.</p>

<p>But the young man in the faded pull-over interested him for
other reasons. That eager dark face, with its strange shock of
bright hair tossed back from a too prominent forehead, was full
of intellectual excitement.</p>

<p>"I hate interviews--don't see any sense in them," Vance began,
but in a tone so friendly that his visitor rejoined with a laugh:
"Oh, you're thinking of the heart-to-heart kind, probably. With a
snap-shot of yourself looking at the first crocus in your garden;
or smoking a pipe, with your arm round a Great Dane."</p>

<p>"Well..." Vance acknowledged. "Transposed into 'Windmill'
terms..."</p>

<p>"Yes; I know. But that's not my line. Honest to God, it isn't,
as you say in the States." The young man looked at Vance with a
whimsical smile. "I wish it were--for my bank-account. The human
touch is worth its weight in gold, and outlives all the fashions.
But all I care about is ideas; or else the world in which they
are completely non-existent. And I prefer the latter, only it's
too expensive for me." He paused, and then added: "My name's
Christopher Churley, by the way."</p>

<p>"Oh--you live up the hill, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you call it living. I say, can I have my talk now?
The 'Windmill' people are rather in a hurry. But of course if
it's not convenient--"</p>

<p>Vance was looking at him with compassionate interest. This was
the sombre Colonel's son. The sombreness was there--Vance
perceived it instantly, under a surface play of chaff and
self-derision that was sadder than the father's open gloom; but
the youth's look of flaming intelligence had no counterpart in
the Colonel's heavy stare.</p>

<p>"I was going for a tramp. But if you'd rather come in now and
have a talk--"</p>

<p>"Thanks a lot. You'll let me, then?" Chris Churley's eyes were
illuminated. "But I don't mind walking, you know; not if I can
take it easy, on account of my limp; and if you'll let me take
the landscape for granted."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can, can you? Take all this for granted?" Vance
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes. Rather a pity, I suppose. I daresay there are lots of
poor devils looking at cats on a tin roof through a fog who'd
expand in this Virgilian setting. But I can't. Give me the tin
roof and the cats, if they're in a metropolis. Though what I
really prefer is artifice and luxury. I revel in a beautiful
landscape transformed by the very rich; not just the raw
material, like this..." He waved a contemptuous hand toward the
bright sea and fretted coast-line. "What I care about, you see,
is the landscape of the mind; the intellectual Alps. Or else
cocottes and oil kings round a baccarat table."</p>

<p>"Well, you've a wide range," said Vance, somewhat
distressingly reminded of the stale paradoxes dear to Rebecca
Stram's familiars and the satellites of Lorry's studio.</p>

<p>Young Churley flushed up, and Vance saw his eyes darken as if
in physical pain. "I suppose this sort of talk bores you. I
daresay you've had everything..."</p>

<p>"Oh, have I? Look here," said Vance good-naturedly, "come
upstairs, and we'll talk shop as much as you like, since Oubli
doesn't provide the other alternatives." He pulled out his
cigarettes, and offered them to young Churley. Decidedly the
sight of the Colonel had not prepared him for the Colonel's
son.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c17">XVII</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>On the threshold of the low-ceilinged study, with its rough
yellow-washed walls, Chris Churley stopped to glance curiously
about at the books and papers; the blossoming almond-branch in a
big jar, the old brown Bokhara with the help of which Halo had
contrived a divan piled with brown cushions. "I say--this is
jolly!"</p>

<p>"Not much luxury," Vance grinned, always gratified at the
admiration provoked by Halo's upholstery.</p>

<p>The other shrugged. "I wish you could see Les Mimosas--no, I
don't," he corrected himself hastily; and immediately drew from
his pocket a letter which he handed to Vance. It was in a girl's
hand, dated from London, under the letter-head: "Z&eacute;lide
Spring, Literary Agent and Adviser." It ran: "Darling Chris, the
'Windmill' people have just rung up to say they hear Vance
Weston, who wrote 'The Puritan in Spain,' is at Oubli, and they'd
like an article about him if you can get it done in time for the
next number. Some one has failed them, and they want to shove
this in at once. Of course that means doing it in a rush. Now,
Chris, please, you simply <i>must,</i> or I'll never speak to you
again--" and then: "P.S. You must see him, of course, and get him
to talk to you about his books. How frightfully exciting for you!
Get me an autograph, darling."</p>

<p>Vance laughed as he returned the letter. "This means, I
suppose, that you don't like doing things in a rush."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you?"</i> said young Churley, looking enviously at the
divan. "The very word makes me want to go and stretch out over
there."</p>

<p>"Well, do," said Vance, tossing a fresh packet of cigarettes
in the direction of the divan.</p>

<p>"Honestly? You don't mind? Sprawling here while you're sitting
in a chair makes me feel like a vamp in a talkie. But then that's
the way I really like to feel--luxurious and vicious," Churley
confessed, shaking up the cushions before he plunged his glowing
head into them. "Match? Oh, thanks! Now, then--I suppose I ought
to begin by asking you about 'The Puritan in Spain'."</p>

<p>"No, don't," said Vance, lighting a cigarette, and dropping
into the chair by his writing-table. He was beginning to be
interested and stirred by this vivid youth, who set his ideas
tumbling about excitedly, as Savignac had in the early days in
Paris. Sometimes he felt that he needed a sort of padded cell of
isolation to work in, and then again, when a beam of
understanding flashed through his shuttered solitude, a million
sparks of stimulation rushed in with it.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I've got to! You said I might," Churley
protested.</p>

<p>"I didn't say I'd answer. Not about 'The Puritan',
anyhow."</p>

<p>Young Churley, with a glance of curiosity, raised himself on
his elbow. "No? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I hate it," said Vance carelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, good! I mean--well, hang it, now I've seen you, I begin
to wonder..."</p>

<p>"Why I did it? Yes...If I only knew--! What's that thing in
Tennyson, about 'little flower in the crannied wall', if I knew
what put you there, I'd know all there is to know; or something
of that sort. Well, I was in Spain, and the subject caught me.
What I call one of the siren-subjects...I never stir now
without cotton in my ears."</p>

<p>Churley laughed. "Righto! Glad I don't have to ask you solemn
questions about the book. I'm in rather a difficulty about you
American novelists. Your opportunity's so immense, and...
well, you always seem to write either about princesses in Tuscan
villas, or about gaunt young men with a ten-word vocabulary who
spend their lives sweating and hauling wood. Haven't you got any
subject between the two? There's really nothing as limited as the
primitive passions--except perhaps those of the princesses. I
believe the novelist's richest stuff is in the middle class,
because it lies where its name says, exactly in the middle, and
reaches out so excitingly and unexpectedly in both directions.
But I suppose you haven't a middle class in America, though you
do sometimes have princesses--"</p>

<p>"I rather think we've got a middle class too. But no one wants
to admit belonging to it, because we all do. It's not so
picturesque--"</p>

<p>"Just so! There's its immense plastic advantage. Absolute
safety from picturesqueness--you don't even have to be on your
guard against it. Why don't you write a novel about the middle
class, and call it 'Meridian'?" cried young Churley, with an
inspired wave of his hand, which closed on the packet of
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Because I'm writing one about all mankind called:
'Colossus'."</p>

<p>"You're not? I say...where have those matches gone?
Thanks. But that <i>is</i> a subject! Does it bore you to talk
about your things while they're on the stocks?"</p>

<p>"N--no," said Vance, hesitatingly. All at once he felt the
liberating thrill of the question. Of course it wouldn't bore him
to talk about "Colossus" to anybody with those eager eyes and
that lightning up-take. Here was a fellow with whom you could
argue and theorize by the hour, and so develop the muscles of
your ideas. It was queer he should ever have imagined he could
grind out a big book in a smiling desert like Oubli-sur-Mer. But
the desert animated by one responsive intelligence became exactly
what his mood required. And he began to talk...</p>

<p>Churley listened avidly, his head thrown back, his eyes fixed,
through the curl of incessant cigarettes, on the luminous glitter
beyond the windows. As Vance talked on he was aware, in his
listener, of a curious mental immaturity combined with flashes of
precocious insight. Compared with his friend Savignac, in whose
disciplined intelligence there were so few gaps and
irregularities, this youth's impatient brain was as uncertain as
the sea; but it had the sea's bright sallies and sudden
irresistible onslaughts. Arguing with him about "Colossus"
reminded Vance of the hour he had spent in the unknown church
during a thunderstorm, when the obscurity was torn by flashes
that never lasted long enough for him to do more than guess at
what they lit up.</p>

<p>Chris Churley was probably not more than three or four years
younger than himself; yet a world seemed to divide them. Churley
still lived on the popular catchwords of which Vance had already
wearied; yet he appeared to have discarded many of the ideas
which were the very substance of Vance's mind.</p>

<p>They talked on and on, till the radiance faded into dusk and
Halo came with a lamp and the suggestion of tea or cocktails.
Churley, in her presence, was as easy and natural as with Vance.
"I've come to make an article out of Mr. Weston for the
'Windmill'," he explained, smiling; "it's a tremendous chance for
me," and Vance saw that Halo felt, as he had, the happy
simplicity of the youth's manner. In the last few months he had
grown more observant of Halo's changes of expression, and quicker
in divining her response to the persons they were thrown with.
She was going to like Chris Churley, Vance thought, listening to
her friendly questions, and to their easy interchange of talk.
The mere fact that the newcomer was going to write an article
about Vance in a review of such standing as the "Windmill" was a
sufficient recommendation to Halo; but, apart from that, Vance
saw that she and Churley talked the same language, and would
always be at ease with each other.</p>

<p>"I was wondering whether you were going to take to that chap
or not," he said, when Churley, roused to the lateness of the
hour, had sprung up exclaiming that he must hurry home and get to
work. "I'll bring the article in a couple of days if I may," he
called back from the threshold. "It's my chance, you know; if
this thing suits them I hope they'll take me on regularly; and
it's just conceivable that in time that might mean: London!" He
pronounced the word with a mystical stress that lit up his whole
face.</p>

<p>"Of course I take to him," Halo responded to Vance's question.
"Poor boy! What life at Les Mimosas must be! I could see how he
shied away from questions, about his family...I suppose
they're miserably poor, and gloomy and ill. We must have him here
as much as possible; you must do all you can to help him with the
article."</p>

<p>Young Churley reappeared punctually in two days; but he did
not bring the article. It had taken, he explained, more thinking
over than he had foreseen. And, if Weston didn't mind, there were
just a few more questions he'd like to put.</p>

<p>This was the prelude to another long and exhilarating talk.
The actual questions were not, as far as Vance could recall, ever
put, either then or later; but the big psychological panorama
which he was attempting in "Colossus" was the point of departure
for an absorbing discussion of the novelist's opportunities and
limitations. Young Churley seemed to have read everything, and
thought about most things, without ever reaching any intellectual
conclusions; the elasticity of his judgments was as startling to
Vance as his uncanny quickness of apprehension. Good talk was
doubtless a rare luxury to him, and he was evidently determined
to make the most of his opportunity. Day after day he returned to
the pink villa, at first apologetically, soon as a matter of
course; and while he lolled on the brown divan, or lay
outstretched on the sand of one of the rocky coves along the bay,
every allusion that Vance made, every point on which he touched,
started a new hare for young Churley's joyful pursuit. At one
moment he seemed full of interest in Vance's idea of celebrating
the splendour and misery of the average man, and produced a great
Pascalian aphorism for his title-page; but the next he was
declaring that the only two things in the world he really loathed
were Oubli-sur-Mer and the Categorical Imperative, and urging
Vance to write a novel about a wealthy, healthy and perfectly
happy young man who murders his best friend simply to show he is
above middle-class prejudices.</p>

<p>Halo, as her way was with Vance's friends, came and went about
her daily occupations, sometimes joining the two on their
picnics, sometimes finding a pretext for remaining at home. Young
Churley continued to amuse and stimulate her, and she often urged
him to come to dine, and sat late with the young men over the
fire of olive-wood; but Vance noticed that she seemed
increasingly anxious, as the months passed, to make him feel that
he was free to come and go without consulting her, or seeking her
company. Even where his work was concerned she had relaxed her
jealous vigilance. She no longer asked how the book was getting
on, or playfully clamoured for fresh copy; she waited till he
brought her his manuscript, betraying neither impatience nor
disappointment if the intervals of waiting were protracted. At
times her exquisite detachment almost made it seem as if she were
quietly preparing for a friendly parting; once or twice, with a
start of fear, he wondered if, as he had once imagined, her
husband were not trying to persuade her to come back; but
whenever she and Vance were alone together she was so entirely
her old self, so simply and naturally the friend and lover of
always, that the possibility became inconceivable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the days passed, and no more was said of Churley's
article. Vance himself, in the rapid growth of his new
friendship, had already lost sight of its first occasion; it was
Halo who, a fortnight or so after the youth's first appearance,
said one night, as he took leave: "Aren't we to be allowed to see
the article, after all?"</p>

<p>"The article--the article?" Churley's brilliant eyes met hers
in genuine perplexity. "Oh, that 'Windmill' thing? Glad you
reminded me! It ought to have been done long ago, oughtn't it?"
he added, in a tone of disarming confidence.</p>

<p>"Well, you told us it might be a chance--an opening; that if
you could secure a regular job with the 'Windmill' you might be
able to get away."</p>

<p>"Oh--if I could! If I only could! You're perfectly right; I
<i>did</i> say so. I was all on fire to do the article..." He
hesitated, wrinkling his brows, his eyes still wistfully on hers.
"But the fact is--I wonder if you'll understand?--I'm in a
frightful dilemma. I can't write here; and I can't make enough
money to get away unless I do write. Can you suggest a way out, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>Halo laughed. "The only one, I should say, is that you should
want to get away badly enough to force yourself to write, whether
you want to or not."</p>

<p>His eyes widened. "Oh, you really think one can force one's
self to write? That's interesting. Do you think so too, Weston?"
he asked, turning toward Vance a smile of elfin malice.</p>

<p>Vance reddened. Halo's answer seemed to him inconceivably
stupid. If only outsiders wouldn't give advice to fellows who
were trying to do things! But probably you could never cure a
woman of that. All his sympathy, at the moment, was with Churley...</p>

<p>"That remark of Halo's was meant for me," he said, laughing.
"But I suppose if you were to shut yourself up and set your teeth
...that is, if you still feel you want to do the article," he
added, remembering that Churley might affect inertia as a pretext
for dropping a subject he was tired of. The other seemed to guess
his idea.</p>

<p>"Want to do it? I've got it all blazing away in my head at
this very minute! I never wanted to do a thing more. But when I
look out at this empty grimacing sea...or think of Miss
Pamela Plummet reading 'Ships That Pass In The Night' for the
hundredth time, or Mrs. Dorman picking up knitting stitches for
Lady Dayes-Dawes--for heaven's sake, Weston, how can a fellow do
anything in this place but lie on his back and curse his God?" He
looked from one to the other with a comic plaintiveness. "But
there; you think me a poor thing, both of you. And so I
am--pitiable. Only, hang it all, even the worm can turn--can turn
out an article! And so can I. You'll see. Now that I think of it,
I had a desperate wire from Z&eacute;lide this morning. The
'Windmill' people say they <i>must</i> have something about you,
and they offer to give me till the end of this week if I'll
produce it. When <i>is</i> the end of this week? I had an idea
today was already the beginning of next...but that's just a
dastardly pretext for not doing the article...By Jove, I'll go
home and start tonight--and finish it too! Or at least, I'll do
it this morning, because it's already morning. I say, Weston, can
I drop in with it tomorrow after dinner?"</p>

<p>Churley did not drop in that evening, nor for the two days
following. "He's really buckled down to it," Halo hopefully
prophesied; but on the third day he reappeared, and said he had
started writing the article and then torn up the beastly thing
because it read so precisely like what every other literary
critic had already said about every other novelist. "If only
there was a new language perhaps we'd have new thoughts; if there
was a new alphabet, even! When I try to harness together those
poor broken-winded spavined twenty-six letters, and think of the
millions and millions of ways they've already been combined into
platitudes, my courage fails me, and I haven't the heart to
thrash them onto their shaky old legs again. Why on earth don't
you inventive fellows begin by inventing a new language?"</p>

<p>Vance shrugged. "I guess there'd be people turning out
platitudes in it the very first week."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what comes next. You're going to tell me that all
the big geniuses have managed to express themselves in new ways
with the old material. But, after all, history does show that
every now and then culture has reached a dead level of
stagnation, and then..."</p>

<p>"Well, go home now, and write that down!" Vance laughingly
proposed; but Churley laughed too, and said he wasn't in the mood
for writing, and if they were going on a picnic, as Mrs. Weston
had suggested, was there any objection to his going with
them?</p>

<p>Late that night Vance, as he often did at that hour, sat on
his balcony looking out over the darkening waters. He liked these
southern nights without a moon, when the winter constellations
ruled in a dark blue heaven and rained their strong radiance on
the sea. His inspiration, which had begun to flag before Chris
Churley's appearance, now flowed with a strong regular beat. The
poor boy's talk had done for Vance what Vance's society had
failed to do for him. Vance knew that his creative faculty had
grown strong enough to draw stimulus from contradiction instead
of being disturbed by it. To the purely analytical intelligence
such questions as their talks had raised might be unsettling and
sterilizing; but, as always in the full tide of invention, he
felt himself possessed by a brooding spirit of understanding,
some mystic reassurance which sea and sky and the life of men
transmitted from sources deeper than the reason. He had never
been able to formulate it, but he had caught, in the pages of all
the great creative writers, hints of that mysterious subjection
and communion, impossible to define, but clear to the initiated
as the sign exchanged between members of some secret brotherhood.
Ah, they were the happy people--the only happy people,
perhaps--these through whom the human turmoil swept not to ravage
but to fertilize. He leaned on the balcony, looking out at the
sea, and pondered on his task, and blessed it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A few days later, after one of the unproductive mornings which
often followed on his stretches of feverish work, Vance said to
Halo: "When you said that the other day to Churley about a man's
forcing himself to write, I suppose you were thinking of me, and
the endless time I'm taking to do this book."</p>

<p>There had been a day when Halo would have protested, and he
would have been sorry that he had spoken; but a new Halo, with
steadier nerves and smoother temper, had replaced the pleasing
anxious spirit of last year, and she only rejoined, with a glance
of good-natured surprise: "Why, Vance, how absurd! With a book on
the scale of this one you're bound to take a long time to get to
the top of the hill."</p>

<p>That was sensible enough; but Vance was in the mood to feel
that a sensible answer could only be a transparent attempt to
humour him. "Oh, well--climbing's not bad exercise. But what you
said has frightened away poor Churley..."</p>

<p>"Frightened him--why?"</p>

<p>"Writers don't much care to be told by outsiders to buckle
down to their work. They generally get enough of that sort of
advice in their own families."</p>

<p>"Oh, poor boy! I'm sorry! But how could he have minded? He's
always joking about his own laziness."</p>

<p>"That's different," Vance retorted; and Halo, without
appearing to notice his tone, suggested that he should go and
hunt up his young friend. "Perhaps he may have stayed away
because he's ill; he looks spectral at times. I'm sure it would
please him if you looked him up."</p>

<p>Churley had never suggested his friend's coming to see him,
and Vance thought he might interpret an unsought visit as an
attempt to remind him of the article he perhaps no longer wished
to write. To a youth so acutely self-conscious it would seem
natural that an author should attach great importance to being
reviewed by him. But the possibility that he might be lying ill
in that dreary house made Vance decide to follow Halo's advice.
As he mounted the hill, the house, rising above him in its
neglected garden with windows shuttered against the sun, seemed
to take the warmth out of the air, and he felt half inclined to
turn back. While he stood there the blistered front door was
jerked open and Colonel Churley came out. The Colonel looked at
him with astonishment, and said: "Oh--" in a voice as sombre as
his countenance, but somehow less forbidding; and on Vance's
asking for his son, replied unexpectedly: "Ah--you're a friend of
his, are you?"</p>

<p>Vance hesitated. "Well, a literary friend...yes...We
both write, sir..."</p>

<p>The Colonel considered him thoughtfully. "Ah--you write?
Indeed? I wish you'd persuade my son to do as much. But I've no
idea where he is at present; none whatever. I seldom have any
idea where he is," the Colonel concluded, in a voice more
sorrowful than angered; and he lifted his hat with a gesture
which implied that he expected Vance to precede him to the gate.
If Chris were within his father evidently did not mean the
visitor to know it. He did not even ask Vance's name. At the gate
he turned with another bow, and strode away through the
olives.</p>

<p>That evening Chris Churley reappeared. He looked drawn and
colourless, and flinging himself down on the divan plunged his
hand into Vance's box of cigarettes. For a while they talked of a
new book that Vance had lent him (and which he had promised to
return, and hadn't); then, when Halo left the room for a moment,
he said abruptly: "I suppose it was you who looked me up this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Yes. I met your father at the door. He said he didn't know
where you were."</p>

<p>"And you told him you were a literary pal?" Churley laughed.
"He didn't for a minute believe that. He thought you were one of
my waster friends come to carry me off on a spree. My father and
mother always think that, when anybody they don't know comes to
see me."</p>

<p>"Wasters? I shouldn't think there were many in this place,"
said Vance, smiling.</p>

<p>"<i>They</i> do. They think they're everywhere where I am. My
mother's convinced there's a private gambling hell in one of the
houses on the quay. I daresay there is--and a filthy hole it must
be. What my family can't understand is that riotous living,
unless it's on the grand scale, appeals to me no more than
getting drunk on cheap wine at a <i>bistro.</i> What I want to
make me go astray is marble halls and millions; and Oubli is
fairly safe from both." He sat up and clutched his tossed red
hair in his brown hands. "Oh, God, Weston, if I could get away!
If only I could get away!"</p>

<p>Vance was moved at the cry. Well, why couldn't he get away?
And where would he go, and what would he do, if he could?</p>

<p>"Go? Straight to London, by God!" Churley swung around on the
divan, his eyes dark with excitement under his flaming hair.
"London, of course. If I could have a month there, with nobody to
nag me, or ask me when I was going to get to work again (I know
what my father told you--I know); if I could have a fortnight,
even, I could write that article about you, and a couple of
others that have occurred to me during our talks; and with those
articles I'd go to the 'Windmill', and from what Z&eacute;lide
says I'm practically certain they'd take me on permanently. But
what am I to do, without a penny in my pocket? That's what my
people can't be got to see. You must have found, haven't you,
that there are places where a man can work, and places where he
can't, though nobody but an artist can understand, and other
people imagine you can say to a writer: 'Well, how is it you
haven't turned out your thousand words this morning?' as they'd
say to a child in the nursery: 'Now, then, down with that
cod-liver oil, or I'll know why'."</p>

<p>The appeal reminded Vance of his own ineffectual efforts, the
hours of agonizing inability to express what was in him, and the
intervals when even the craving for expression failed because
there was only emptiness within. Remembering his good fortune,
the difficulties surmounted, the distinction achieved, the
tenderness and understanding that had silently fostered his
talent, he felt ashamed of the contrast between his fate and
Churley's.</p>

<p>"Oh, see here; things may not be as bad as you think; we'll
see what can be done..." he began, laying his hand on the
other's shoulder; and at the terrible light in Churley's eyes
Vance understood that he was already pledged to help the flight
to London.</p>

<p>He had been rather afraid of Halo's disapproval when she
learned what he had done. His earnings from "The Puritan in
Spain" had not been large, for the book had been more fashionable
than popular; and Halo's means were cramped by the necessity of
helping her parents. Mr. and Mrs. Spear had always been a costly
luxury, and Vance suspected that Lorry had taken advantage of his
sister's being in Paris to extract from her a share of the
spoils. But Halo was full of sympathy for poor Churley. "Of
course you couldn't do anything else. I daresay he's right in
saying he can do you better when he gets you in some sort of
perspective." (This had been Churley's explanation to Halo, when
she had returned to the study and found the two young men
discussing Chris's departure.) "A 'close-up' must be horribly
difficult, unless you're a Boswell; and I don't believe poor
Chris will ever be anybody's Boswell but his own. Anyhow, I can
see that his only chance is to get into another atmosphere. It's
just like you, dear, to understand..."</p>

<p>The loan, they agreed, could not be less than twenty pounds;
with the trip to London deducted that would barely leave him a
carefree month. After he had gone Vance said to Halo: "I wish I'd
told him straight off that I wanted to give him that money. There
are times when it paralyzes a man to know that the money he's
sweating to earn has got to be passed straight over to somebody
else." He was thinking of his own early struggles, and of what it
would have meant, at the moment of Laura Lou's illness, to have a
friend guess his distress and help him out. Churley had already
started--he had caught the first train the morning after his
appeal to Vance; but Vance and Halo decided that as soon as he
sent them his London address Vance should write that he wished
the money to be regarded as a gift.</p>

<p>It was a surprise that the days passed without further news.
After Chris's jubilant farewells Halo had expected a post-card
from Toulon or Marseilles; but Vance, better acquainted with
young men's ways, pointed out that Chris's chief difficulty
seemed to be an inability to use his pen. "He'll send his address
in time; but he may not even do that till he's finished the
article. I think he felt rather uncomfortable at having talked so
much about it, and then not having put a line on paper. Poor
devil--I owe him more than he does me, for our talks seem to have
given me a fresh start."</p>

<p>And so it proved. Churley had stirred up many ideas in the
course of their long debates, and Vance's acceleration of energy
rushed at once into the channels of his work. The weeks passed
rapidly between ardent hours of writing and long loiterings on
hill and shore. When Vance's brain was in full activity his hours
of idleness acquired a new quality. It was as though he looked at
everything through the powerful lens of his creative energy, so
that the least detail of the landscape, the faintest fugitive
play of cloud and sun, sufficed to enrich his dream.</p>

<p>With the end of January the southern spring began; clouds of
translucent almond-bloom on rough red terraces, blue patches of
borage in stony fields, the celandine shining in wet leafy
hollows, blackthorn and tamarisk along the lanes; and a few weeks
later, among the hills and above the sea, under the olives and
through the vines, the miraculous snowfall of the daffodils.</p>

<p>Vance and Halo went off daily, staff in hand, prolonging their
wanderings more and more, exploring secret valleys, mounting to
granite mountain-crests or wading and scrambling along miles of
red rock and amber sand, with a peacock sea glittering through
the pine-trunks when they climbed or, when they dropped down to
it, lapping their feet with silver. Sometimes, when they had
planned a long excursion, Vance was up before sunrise, and got in
two or three hours of writing before they started; and when they
came back, at sunset or under a cool wintry moon, it was good to
lie on the divan, fagged and happy, and dream of tomorrow's
work.</p>

<p>The day came when Vance, looking back, understood that at that
moment the Furies had slept, and life given him all it could.
Even at the time he felt a singular peace and plenitude. His work
was going well; his heart was quiet, and the sameness of his days
seemed their most exquisite quality. One evening in particular
when, looking up, he had seen Halo bending over to stir the fire,
her dark head outlined against the flame, he had felt in his
breast a new emotion, clear as that flame, as if out of their
loving and quarrelling, the uneasy blazing and smouldering of
their passion, something winged and immortal had sprung, and
brooded over them.</p>

<p>He gave a chuckle of contentment, and Halo's smile questioned
him. "What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Perhaps the peace that passeth
understanding...Poor Churley," he added, "I was just thinking
of the way he has of using up things after one look at them. As
if beauty weren't eternally different every morning."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is to him, in London," Halo mused; then their
talk, veering from Churley, wandered back to the day's excursion,
and to their plans for the morrow.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Since they had left Paris neither Halo nor Vance had reverted
to the subject of the latter's talk with Lewis Tarrant. Vance
shrank from touching again on the question of the divorce, and if
Halo had any news to impart she seemed reluctant to communicate
it. The quiet weeks at Oubli had been a sort of truce of God, a
magic interval of peace which neither ventured to disturb. But
one day, not long after their happy evening by the fire, Halo,
who sat going over the letters they had found on their return
from a long tramp, uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"What's up?" Vance questioned; and she went over to his desk
and laid before him a cutting from a New York paper. Vance read:
"Prize-giving Millionairess Announces Marriage to Gratz Blemer.
Mrs. Pulsifer Privately Weds Novelist Who Won Her Ten Thousand
Dollar Best-Novel Prize"; and beneath this headline: "Society and
literary circles were electrified last night by the announcement
that Mrs. Pulsifer, the wealthy New York fashion-leader and giver
of numerous literary prizes, was privately married two months ago
at Pinehurst, N.C., to Gratz Blemer, the novelist, famous as the
author of 'This Globe', and whose last novel, 'The Rush Hour',
was awarded a few months ago the new Pulsifer Best-Novel prize,
recently founded by the bride. Mr. and Mrs. Blemer are spending
their honeymoon on the bride's steam-yacht in the
Mediterranean."</p>

<p>Halo and Vance looked at each other in silence; then Halo said
with a faint smile: "That accounts for a great deal."</p>

<p>Vance nodded. He tried to smile too; but the brief paragraph
had called up a vision of his midnight talk with Tarrant. He felt
as if the world with its treacheries, shocks and torments had
once again broken into the charmed circle of their lives; and
looking up at Halo he saw the same distress in her eyes. "Well,
we needn't bother; it's all outside of us, anyhow," he said
defiantly; and she bent over to lay a kiss on his forehead.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The next day it rained. Vance, who had given himself a week's
idleness, sat down before "Colossus", and Halo with equal heroism
descended to the verandah to clean the oil lamps. She was deep in
her task when Mrs. Dorman came up the path, sheltering her
bedraggled straw hat under a dripping umbrella.</p>

<p>It was long since any one from the Pension Britannique had
called at the pink house; Halo concluded that the chaplain's wife
had come to ask for a contribution to the church bazaar, or a
subscription to renew the matting in the porch, and hurriedly
calculated what could be spared from their month's income,
already somewhat depleted by the gift to Chris Churley.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorman, when she had disposed of her umbrella, and been
led indoors, did not immediately disclose the object of her
visit. She hoped they were not in for a rainy spring, she said;
but she had warned the new arrivals at Madame Fleuret's that,
after the fine weather they'd had all winter, they must expect a
change. "I saw dear Madame Fleuret making signs to me to stop,"
Mrs. Dorman continued complacently, "but Major Masterman, who was
thinking of hiring a motor-cycle by the month, said he was
thankful I'd warned him, and very likely if the bad weather
continued he and Mrs. Masterman would dash over to the Balearics
instead of staying on at the pension; and they telegraphed to
some friends for whom they'd asked Madame Fleuret to reserve
rooms that they'd better go elsewhere. So it was really a
kindness to tell them, wasn't it?...But, dear Mrs. Weston,
what I've come for is to bring you a message...a private
message..." Mrs. Dorman continued, her cheeks filling out and
growing pink, as they did when she had anything painful to
impart. "It's just this: you were kind enough, some weeks since,
to offer to call on Mrs. Churley. At the time she couldn't see
any one; but she's asked me to say that she'd be so glad if you'd
come up this afternoon...at once, if you could, as the
Colonel is rather opposed to her receiving visits, and she'd like
to be sure of his not getting back from his walk while you're
there. And she begs you, please, not to mention that I've asked
you..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorman's lowered voice and roseate flush gave her words
an ominous air; and Halo at once thought: "Chris!" Her first
impulse was to ask the reason of the summons; but respect for
Mrs. Churley's reserve, whatever it might conceal, made her
answer: "Very well; I'll wash the oil off and come."</p>

<p>As she and Mrs. Dorman climbed the hill, Mrs. Dorman remarked
that the mason had told her the roof of Les Mimosas was certain
to fall in the next time there were heavy rains, and that when
she had notified Colonel Churley he had said those fellows were
always after a job; but thereafter she relapsed into silence, as
though the first glimpse of that barricaded house-front had
checked even her loquacity.</p>

<p>In the vestibule the heavy smell of an unaired house met the
two women. A crumpled dishcloth trailed on the stairs, and in a
corner stood a broken-handled basket full of rusty garden tools
festooned with cobwebs. It must have been years since they had
been used, Halo reflected, remembering the untended garden. Mrs.
Dorman, who had tiptoed up ahead, leaned over and signed to her
to follow. A door opened, letting out a sickly waft of ether, and
Halo found herself pushed into a darkened room, and heard Mrs.
Dorman whisper: "There she is. Mind the footstool. I'll slip down
and mount guard in case he should come back."</p>

<p>Halo paused, trying to make her way among the uncertain shapes
of the furniture; then a shawled figure raised itself from a
lounge, and a woman's voice exclaimed: "Mrs. Weston, what do you
know of my son?"</p>

<p>Halo's eyes were growing used to the dimness and she saw a
small muffled-up body, and a hollow-cheeked face with tossed
white hair and burning eyes like Chris's. "She must have been
very beautiful--oh, poor thing!" Halo thought; and the thin
plaintive voice went on: "Do sit down. There's a chair there,
isn't there? Please clear off anything that's on it. I'm nearly
blind--and so unused to visitors. And the only thing I can think
of is my boy."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry. We've been wondering why there's no news of
him," said Halo, taking the chair.</p>

<p>"Then you've heard nothing either?" Mrs. Churley, propped up
among her cushions, gazed with a sort of spectral timidity at her
visitor; as though, Halo thought, she were a ghost who feared to
look at the living.</p>

<p>"No; nothing since he left for London."</p>

<p>"For London?" Mrs. Churley echoed, stressing the word. "Ah, he
told you London too?"</p>

<p>Halo, surprised, said yes; and Mrs. Churley went on: "My poor
boy...it was the only way to get his father to let him go."
She lowered her voice to a whisper. "He told us he'd been offered
a permanent position on a well-known review--the 'Windmill', I
think they call it--and that the editor wanted him at once, and
had sent him an advance of five pounds. It was a great
opportunity--and of course his father had to let him go."</p>

<p>"Of course--" Halo murmured.</p>

<p>"And so I said nothing," the mother continued in her
distressful whisper, "though I was sure editors don't often send
advances to beginners; for I suspected that your husband had been
generous enough...to...you understand..."</p>

<p>"Yes..."</p>

<p>"And I was so grateful, and so happy at my boy's having a job,
because I hoped--my husband and I hoped--that it would make him
settle down. You <i>do</i> think he has talent?"</p>

<p>"I think he's full of talent; we both do. Though as it happens
we've never actually seen anything he's written..."</p>

<p>"Ah--" Mrs. Churley interjected in a stricken murmur, sinking
back against the cushions.</p>

<p>"Only now, I'm sure--with such an opening, and the discipline
of an editorial office...You'll see..." Halo went on
reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's what we thought. We felt so hopeful; I've never
before seen my husband hopeful."</p>

<p>"Well, you must go on hoping. You'll hear from Chris as soon
as he's settled."</p>

<p>Mrs. Churley again raised herself on her elbow, her face
twisted with pain by the effort. "Mrs. Weston," she brought out,
"my son hasn't gone to London." She paused, watching Halo with
startled dilated eyes. "I've just heard, from a friend who saw
him the other day, that he's at Nice!" The words fell into the
silence of the muffled room as if every one rang out the knell of
a hope. "At Nice, Mrs. Weston--<i>Nice!"</i></p>

<p>It was an anti-climax, certainly; and Halo, after a first
start of surprise, could not repress a smile.</p>

<p>"But are you sure? Was your friend sure, I mean? Did he
actually speak to your son?"</p>

<p>"He didn't speak to him; but he saw him going into a
night-club with a party of dreadfully fast-looking people." Mrs.
Churley clasped her emaciated hands. "Mrs. Weston, I'm speaking
in the deepest confidence. My husband would be very angry if he
knew. He's convinced that Chris is in London, and if he were to
find out that we've been deceived again I dread to think what
would happen. My husband has never understood that people may be
unable to resist temptation--he says: why should they let
themselves be tempted? The artist's nature is incomprehensible to
him..." She leaned forward, and caught Halo's wrist. "It was
from me that my poor boy inherited that curse. I used to write
poetry--but my husband thought it unsuitable in an officer's
wife...Oh, if you knew how we'd struggled and fought to keep
Chris out of temptation...When my husband was retired we came
to Oubli, in the hope that here our boy would be safe. He has a
real love of literature; he's always wanted to write. But
something invariably seems to prevent him...the least little
thing puts him off. We hoped he would choose a steadier
profession; but when we saw that was useless we decided to come
here, where there are so few distractions..."</p>

<p>"But don't you think that may be the reason?" Halo interposed.
"Young men need distractions--they're part of the artist's
training."</p>

<p>"Part of his training? Oh, Mrs. Weston! Forgive my asking: are
those your husband's ideas?"</p>

<p>Halo smiled. "His idea is that the sooner Chris settles down
to work the better."</p>

<p>"Ah, just so--just so! You're sure Mr. Weston didn't intend
him to use the money to go to Nice?"</p>

<p>In spite of her pity for the unhappy mother Halo felt a
growing impatience. "If you wish to know the truth, we did give
your son a--a small sum, but on the understanding that he was
going to London to secure the job he had been promised."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor Chris--my poor Chris! And now what is to become
of him? For years I've been dreading lest he should get money and
escape from us again. It happened once before." Mrs. Churley hid
her face in her hands, and broke into stifled sobbing.</p>

<p>Halo knelt down by the lounge. "Mrs. Churley, please don't be
so distressed. After all, we must all follow our bent...
artists especially...It may be best in the end for Chris to
work out his own salvation..."</p>

<p>"Salvation? Among those dreadful people? And weak as he
is--and with no health? When I think it was I who laid on him the
curse of the artist's nature! Oh, promise me that Mr. Weston will
help to find him, and bring him back before his father
knows."</p>

<p>"What is it his father's not to know?" came a tremulous bass
voice, and Colonel Churley stepped into the room, with Mrs.
Dorman wailing in the rear: "But, dear Colonel Churley, do wait!
I assure you it may not be as bad as we fear!"</p>

<p>Halo discerned in the Colonel's frowning countenance the same
quiver of distress as in his voice. "He minds it even more than
she does," she thought, looking from the threatening jut of his
white eyebrows to the troubled blue of his eyes. "This is an
unexpected honour--my wife is able to see so few people." The
Colonel bowed stiffly to Halo with a questioning side-glance at
Mrs. Churley, whose eyes were anxiously fixed on him. "Mrs.
Weston has been so kind. I wanted to thank her..." Her voice
faded into silence.</p>

<p>"And knowing that visitors are too fatiguing for you, you took
advantage of my absence to do so," the Colonel interposed,
lifting his lean brown forefinger in an attempt at
playfulness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Colonel Churley, really...there's been no bad news as
yet," Mrs. Dorman protested.</p>

<p>The Colonel turned with a frightened frown; his purplish lips
trembled. "No bad news? Has there been any news? Has Mrs. Weston
brought us news of my son?"</p>

<p>"No, no...it was only my idea that dear Mrs. Churley
should ask her if she and Mr. Weston hadn't heard anything," Mrs.
Dorman faltered, her round face red with fright.</p>

<p>The Colonel again bowed. "Most kind--most thoughtful. I'm
extremely obliged to all our friends for their interest. Mrs.
Weston may not know that Chris has gone to London to take up an
editorial position; in the rush of his new duties he has delayed
to write." He addressed himself to Halo with an apologetic smile.
"My wife is an invalid; I'm afraid the time sometimes hangs
heavily on her, in spite of the kindness you ladies show
her--especially so when her son's away. She doesn't realize that
young men are often bad correspondents; and knowing that you and
Mr. Weston were kind enough to receive Chris, she fancied you
might have heard from him."</p>

<p>"No," said Halo, "we've heard nothing."</p>

<p>"There, my dear," pursued the Colonel, "you see we've not been
less favoured than others. The boy will write when he has time."
Mrs. Churley's weeping had subsided into a little clucking
murmur. The Colonel turned to Halo.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you should have come when my wife is more than
usually unequal to receiving company." He stood looking almost
plaintively at Halo, who thought:</p>

<p>"What he hates most of all is my seeing this untidy neglected
house, and that poor creature in her misery." She understood, and
wishing Mrs. Churley goodbye turned toward the door. Colonel
Churley opened it with a shaking hand, and Halo and Mrs. Dorman
went from the room and down the stairs. Following them as they
descended came the low clucking sound of Mrs. Churley's
weeping.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c20">XX</a></h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo had been so moved by the sight of the ailing woman and
the angry ineffectual old man, left alone in that dismal house to
heap each other with recriminations, that she communicated her
emotion to Vance; and when he proposed going to look for Chris
she welcomed the suggestion. "The boy haunts me. To do anything
so dishonest he must be in a bad way; and I feel as if we ought
to do what we can."</p>

<p>"Oh, he never meant to be dishonest. When he got to Toulon he
probably saw a train starting for Nice, and was tempted by the
idea of a night's fun."</p>

<p>"A night's fun! But it's a month since he went away, and it
was only a day or two ago that Mrs. Churley's friend saw
him."</p>

<p>"Well, it's pretty smart of him to have made the money last as
long as that," Vance rejoined with a laugh; but in reality he too
felt a vague pang at the thought of the irresponsible boy caught
in that sordid whirlpool.</p>

<p>In the train his reflexions grew less emotional. It was
obviously none of his business to find and reclaim Chris, even
supposing the latter had deliberately deceived them, and used
Vance's money to offer himself a few weeks' amusement; but there
was something so droll in this act of defiance that Vance, in
spite of his pity for the parents, was amused at the idea of
being confronted with the son.</p>

<p>He was also acutely interested in the prospect of seeing for
the first time the pleasure-seeking end of the Riviera. The
contrast between Oubli-sur-Mer and the succession of white cities
reflected in azure waters emphasized the narrowness and monotony
of the life he had been leading. Slipping past towering palace
hotels, and villas girt with lawns and pergolas, he recalled the
mouldy blistered fronts of the pink house and the Pension
Britannique; when, at the stations, flower-girls thrust up great
sheaves of freesias and carnations, he saw the handful of wizened
anemones bargained for by Miss Plummet at the market, and brought
home to her invalid sister; and the motors pouring along wide
dustless roads to inviting distances evoked the lurching omnibus
crowded with garlicky peasants which, through clouds of
suffocating dust, carried Oubli-sur-Mer to Toulon or Marseilles.
A few hours earlier the quiet of Oubli had seemed a spiritual
necessity; but already the new scenes were working their old
spell.</p>

<p>These alternations of mood, which he had once ascribed to
instability of aim, no longer troubled him. He knew now that they
were only the play of the world of images on his creative
faculty, and that his fundamental self remained unchanged under
such shifting impulses. By the time the train reached Nice he was
so lost in the visionary architecture of his inner world that the
other had become invisible. He gazed at the big station packed
with gaily dressed people and busy flower-sellers without
remembering that it was there he should have got out; and now the
guard was crying "Monte Carlo", and above the station glittered
the minarets and palms of the Casino.</p>

<p>"Well--why not?" Vance thought. Chris was as likely to be at
Monte Carlo as at Nice; it was not probable that he would
restrict his pleasure-seeking to one spot. Vance picked up his
suit-case and jumped out...</p>

<p>Past sloping turf, palms imprisoned in bright blue or glaring
magenta cinerarias, borders of hyacinths and banks of glossy
shrubs, he climbed gaily to the polychrome confusion of the
Casino. Stretching up from it to a stern mountain-background were
villas and restaurants, and caf&eacute;-terraces where brightly
dressed people sipped cocktails under orange-and-white umbrellas.
Nearer by were tall hotels with awninged and flowered balconies;
rows of taxis and private motors between the lawns and
flower-beds before the Casino; young men in tennis flannels and
young women in brilliant sports-suits, and strollers lounging
along the balustraded walks. Among half-tropical trees a band
played a gipsy tune of de Falla's, and children with lovely
flying hair raced ahead of nurses in long blue veils, who
gossiped on the benches or languidly pursued their charges.</p>

<p>Halo would have called it a super-railway poster. She always
spoke scornfully of the place, resenting such profanation of the
gray mountain giants above it. In certain moods Vance might have
agreed; but today the novelty and brightness struck his fancy,
and the trimness of lawns, flowers, houses, satisfied his need of
order and harmony. Everything wore the fairy glitter of a
travelling circus to a small child in a country town, and the
people who passed him looked as unreal, as privileged and
condescending, as the spangled athletes of his infancy. He sat
down on a bench and watched them.</p>

<p>The passing faces were not all young or beautiful; the greater
number were elderly, many ugly, some painful or even repulsive;
but almost all wore the same hard glaze of prosperity. Vance
tried to conjecture what the inner lives of such people could be;
he pictured them ordering rare delicacies in restaurants, buying
costly cigars and jewels in glittering shops, stepping in and out
of deeply-cushioned motors, ogling young women or painted youths,
as sex and inclination prompted. "Chris's ideal," he murmured. He
decided to take a look at the gambling-rooms; but it was
luncheon-time, and people were coming out of the Casino,
descending the steps to their motors or the near-by restaurants.
As he stood there he suddenly caught sight of Lorry Spear; and at
the same instant Lorry recognized him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Vance--you? Halo here? I suppose she's a peg above all
this. Sent you off on your own, has she? Very white of her. Not
staying here, though? Of course not; nobody does. I'm over from
Cannes with a party, to lunch on the Gratz Blemers' yacht--the
biggest of her kind, I believe. You knew Blemer had carried off
Jet Pulsifer under Tarrant's very nose? Sharp fellow, Blemer...they
were secretly married two or three months ago. That
accounts for Tarrant's turning down the divorce, I suppose,"
Lorry rattled on, his handsome uncertain eyes rambling from
Vance's face to search the passing throng. "I say, though--why
not come off to the yacht with us? When I say 'us,' I mean Mrs.
Glaisher and Imp Pevensey, with whom I'm staying at Cannes. Mrs.
Glaisher has taken a villa there, and we're working over the
final arrangements for 'Factories'; at least I hope we are,"
Lorry added with a dubious grin. "With the super-rich you never
can tell; at the last minute they're so darned scared of being
done. But if Imp Pevensey can get Mrs. Blemer to take an interest
she's sure that'll excite Mrs. Glaisher, and make her take the
final step. Almost all their philanthropy's based on rivalry...
Well, so much the better for us...See here, my boy, come
along; they'll jump at the chance of seeing you...Ah, there's
the very young woman I'm on the look out for!" he exclaimed,
darting toward a motor which had stopped before an hotel facing
the Casino.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how Lorry fitted into the scene. In
Montparnasse he had been keen, restless, careless in dress and
manner; here he wore the same glossy veneer as all the rest. The
very cut of his hair and his clothes had been adapted to his
setting, and as he slipped through the crowd about the hotel
Vance was struck by his resemblance to the other young men
strolling in and out of its portals.</p>

<p>He had been amused by Lorry's invitation. He had no intention
of joining Mrs. Glaisher's party, but that Lorry should propose
it after what had passed between them was too characteristic to
surprise him. Lorry had obviously forgotten the Glaisher episode,
though it had occurred under his own roof; on seeing Vance he had
remembered only that the latter was a good fellow whose passing
celebrity had once been useful to him, and might be again. As
Vance waited on the curb he thought how jolly it would be to go
and lunch at one of those little terrace-restaurants over the sea
that he had marked down from the train. After that he would
return to Nice, and devise a way of running down Chris.</p>

<p>"Look here, Vance; you will come?" Lorry, rejoining him,
grasped his arm with a persuasive hand. "No? It's a pity--the
yacht's a wonder. Not to speak of Blemer and Jet! As a novelist
you oughtn't to miss them...Well, so long...Oh, by the way;
won't you dine at Cannes tonight instead? At Mrs.
Glaisher's--Villa Mirifique. I've just been arranging with that
young woman over there to meet us here on our way back from the
yacht. She's coming over to spend a day or two with Mrs.
Glaisher, and I'm sure she'd be delighted to drive you to Cannes.
Come along and I'll introduce you." Lorry, as he spoke, swept
Vance across to the hotel door, where a young lady who stood with
her back to them was giving an order to her chauffeur. The motor
drove off, and she turned and faced them.</p>

<p>"Floss," Lorry cried, "here's a friend of mine, a celebrated
novelist, who wants a lift to Mrs. Glaisher's this evening. Of
course you've heard of Vance Weston--and read 'The Puritan in
Spain'?"</p>

<p>The girl, who had been looking at Lorry, turned
interrogatively to Vance. Her movements had a cool deliberateness
which seemed to single her out from the empty agitation around
her. She lifted her dusky eyelids, and for a few seconds she and
Vance looked at each other without speaking; then: "Why, old
Van!" she said, in a warm voice flattened by the Middle Western
drawl.</p>

<p>Vance stood staring. As through a mist of wine he saw this
woman, become a stranger to his eyes yet so familiar to his
blood. She was very dark; yes, he remembered; a warm dusky
pallor, like the sound of her voice; glints of red under her
skin, and in the gloom of her hair. She rarely smiled--he
remembered that too--when she did it was like a fruit opening to
the sun. His veins kept the feeling of that sultriness...</p>

<p>"Hullo! Old friends, are you? First-rate! Monte Carlo's the
place where nobody ever comes any more, yet where you meet
everybody you know. All right--coming!" Lorry cried,
gesticulating to a group on the other side of the square. "So
long--Villa Mirifique; bring him along, Floss."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll bring him," said the girl in her indifferent drawl;
and Lorry vanished.</p>

<p>Vance continued to look at Floss Delaney. It was not till
afterward that he noticed the quiet elegance of her dress, or
remembered that he had seen her getting out of a private motor
and giving an order to the chauffeur. He knew that late in life
the shiftless Harrison Delaney of Euphoria had stumbled into
wealth as accidentally, almost, as, years before, he had sunk
into poverty. When Vance had gone home after Laura Lou's death
Euphoria was still ringing with the adventure; Vance remembered
the bitterness with which his father, the shrewd indefatigable
little man who had failed to secure the fortune so often in his
grasp, spoke of the idle Delaney's rise. "A loafer like
that--it's enough to cure a man of ever wanting to do an honest
day's work," Lorin Weston had growled. It all came back to Vance
afterward; at the moment he was half-dazed by the encounter with
this girl who had been the vehicle of his sharpest ecstasy and
his blackest anguish. A vehicle; that was what she'd been; all
she'd ever been. "The archway to the infinite"--who was it who
had called woman that? It was true of a boy's first love. In the
days when Floss Delaney had so enraptured and tortured him she
had never had any real identity to his untaught heart and senses;
she had been simply undifferentiated woman; now for the first
time he saw her as an individual, and perceived her peculiar
loveliness. He gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I was thinking I'd nearly shot myself on your account once.
Funny, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'nearly'--that's not much! If you do it again you must
aim better," she said coolly; but he caught the glitter of
pleasure in her eyes. "Old Van--only to think of coming across
you here!" She slipped her hand through his arm, and they walked
across the square and sat down on a bench under overhanging
shrubs. "So you're a celebrity," she said, her full upper lip
lifting in a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, so are you, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Because father's made all that money?" She looked at him
doubtfully. "It's very pleasant," she said, with a defiant tilt
of her chin.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do with it all?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Just go round, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Where's your father? Is he here with you?"</p>

<p>Yes, she told him; she was travelling with her father; they
were staying at the hotel to which Vance had just seen her
driving up. They had been going around Europe for over a year
now: Rome, Paris, Egypt, St. Moritz--all the places they thought
might amuse them. But her father wasn't easy to amuse. He was as
lazy as ever; he didn't so much mind travelling, provided they
went to places where he could have a game of cards; but he didn't
care to go round with new people. She would have preferred to be
at Cannes, where most of her friends were, and everything was
ever so much smarter; but her father had found at Monte Carlo
some old cronies whom he had met the winter before at Luxor, and
he liked to be with them, or else to play baccarat at the Casino.
That day he had gone over to Nice with some of his crowd; she
didn't believe they'd be back till morning. He'd be so surprised
to see Vance when he got back. "He's read your books," she added,
almost ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>"That means you haven't?"</p>

<p>"Well--I will now." She glanced about her, and then down at
the little jewelled watch on her wrist. "I'm on my own today.
Can't you take me off somewhere to lunch?"</p>

<p>Vance sprang up joyfully. He felt ravenous for food, and as
happy as a schoolboy on a holiday. He thought of the
terrace-restaurants he had seen from the train, and wondered if
they would be grand enough for her. "Let's go somewhere right
over the sea," he suggested, trying to describe the kind of place
he meant. "Not swell, you know--not a crowd. Just a little
terrace with a few tables." Yes, that was exactly what she
wanted; away from the noise, and those awful bands--she knew the
very place. It wasn't far off; a little way down the road toward
Cap Martin; but she was too hungry to walk. They took a taxi.</p>

<p>The scene suited her indolent beauty. She was made for the
sunlit luxury to which she affected such indifference. At Oubli
she would have been a false note; here she seemed to justify the
general futility by the way it became her. As he looked at her,
the memory of the Floss Delaney of his boyhood came back to him,
struggling through the ripened and polished exterior of the girl
at his side. After all her face had not changed; it had the same
midsummer afternoon look, as though her penthouse hair were the
shade of a forest, her eyes its secret pools. A still windless
face, suggesting the note of stock-doves, the hum of summer
insects. Vance had always remembered it so. She hardly ever
smiled; and when she laughed, her laugh was a faint throat note
that did not affect the repose of her features. But her body had
grown slenderer yet rounder. Before it had been slightly heavy,
its movements slow and awkward; now it was as light as a feather.
Halo had fine lines, but was too thin, the bones in her neck were
too visible; this girl, who must have been about the same age,
and had the same Diana-like curve from shoulder to hip, was more
rounded, and her hands were smaller and plumper than Halo's,
though not so subtle and expressive.</p>

<p>Vance was glad that he could take note of all this, could even
calmly compare Floss Delaney's appearance with that of the woman
he loved; it proved his emotional detachment, and made him feel
safe and at his ease.</p>

<p>They sat under a gay awning, before a red-and-white
table-cloth, and ate Proven&ccedil;al dishes, and drank a fresh
native wine. Floss, wrinkling her brows against the sun, stole
curious glances at him. "You've changed a lot; you've grown
handsome," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>He laughed, and flushed to the roots of his hair; but she went
on: "I heard you were married; are you?"</p>

<p>He wished she had not put the question; yet a moment later he
was glad she had. It was best that everything should be clear
between them.</p>

<p>"No; I'm not married--yet. But I expect to be. To Lorry
Spear's sister."</p>

<p>"Oh," she murmured, with ironic eye-brows. "She's heard about
Halo and me," he thought; and cursed Mrs. Glaisher.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I'll be married too some day," she went on,
her attention wandering back to herself, as it always did after a
moment; and he felt an abrupt shock of jealousy.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've got lots of fellows after you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Anyhow, I'm not going to make up my mind
yet; I like my freedom." She stressed the word voluptuously,
bending her lips to her glass of pale yellow wine, and as he
watched her he broke out, from some unconscious depth of himself:
"God--how you made me suffer!"</p>

<p>She looked at him with a sort of amused curiosity. "You're
thinking of Euphoria?" He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was a bad girl, I know--but you were a bad boy; and
silly." Her eyes lingered on him. "I used to love to kiss you.
Didn't you love it? But you didn't understand--"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"A girl like me had to look out for herself. There was nobody
to do it for me. But let's talk about what we are <i>now;</i>
what's the use of going back? This is ever so much more fun.
Don't you like being famous?" She leaned across and laid her
brown hand on his. He looked at the polished red nails, and
remembered her blunt dirty finger-tips, the day he had picked her
up in the road after her bicycle accident. Even then, he thought,
she used to spend every cent she could get on paint and perfume.
He smiled at himself and her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the coffee he proposed their going back to the Casino to
gamble; but she refused. "Father gambles; that's enough for one
family. I mean to keep what I've got," she said; and in her
hardening eyes and narrowed lips he detected the reflection of
the lean years at Crampton, and at Dakin, where she had gone (so
his family had told him) as saleswoman in a dry-goods' shop.
Those days had once been a tormenting mystery; but now he only
pitied her for the background of dark memories overshadowing her
brilliant present.</p>

<p>He had told her he would not go with her to Mrs. Glaisher's,
and had been secretly gratified by her pout of disappointment. "I
think you might."</p>

<p>"No; I don't like those people. And anyway, I've got to stop
off at Nice tonight."</p>

<p>Her eyes grew curious. "I wonder what you've got to do at
Nice?"</p>

<p>Half-laughing, he confessed his reason, telling her what he
could of Chris Churley's story without betraying the secret of
the boy's escapade. "His family are worried; they don't know
where he is. The other day some friend of theirs said he'd seen
him at Nice, in a nightclub; so they asked me if I'd hunt him
up."</p>

<p>"Well, that's funny--"</p>

<p>"I know; but they're poor, and sick--at least his mother's
sick--and he's all they've got."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can find him, rummaging round Nice
without an address."</p>

<p>"Neither do I; but I'll have to try."</p>

<p>She sat with lowered lids, meditating. "Tell me again what his
name is."</p>

<p>"Chris Churley."</p>

<p>"That's it. I heard Alders talking about him yesterday."</p>

<p>"Alders?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Glaisher's secretary. He always knows about
everybody."</p>

<p>"A little man who looks like a freckle?"</p>

<p>"Well--I guess so," she said hesitatingly, as if analogies
were unfamiliar to her.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, Alders is sure to be Mrs. Glaisher's
secretary. It's absolutely predestined. You're certain you heard
him mention Chris Churley?"</p>

<p>She still hesitated, and he recalled that she had never had a
good memory for anything that did not directly concern herself,
or hold out some possible advantage. "Well, it was something like
Churley. But I hear so many names. Is he a newspaper man? There
was some fellow I heard Alders talking about, who wanted to get
introduced to Gratz Blemer, and write about him; Alders was going
to fix it up." Vance laughed, and she added: "Do you think that's
it?"</p>

<p>"Sounds like it," he said, picturing to himself the
bewilderment of Blemer, who was used to "straight" interviewing,
under the cross-fire of Chris's literary confidences.</p>

<p>They strolled back toward Monte Carlo. The distance was not
great, and Miss Delaney had declared that she would like to walk;
but she hailed the first taxi. "I guess I'm through with
walking--as long as there's money enough left to go on wheels,"
she said; and Vance thought of her struggling four times a day on
her bicycle through the frozen ruts or the bottomless mud between
Euphoria and Crampton. He understood why the aspirations of the
newly rich were so often what Halo would have called vulgar.</p>

<p>He was still resolved not to go to Mrs. Glaisher's, but he
finally agreed to join Miss Delaney at her hotel, and motor with
her as far as Nice; and she promised to telephone him if Alders
knew where Chris Churley was to be found.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Vance went to the gambling rooms, risked a small sum, and
carried away enough to pay for his outing. He was too much
engrossed in the thought of Floss Delaney to lose his head over
the game; but before leaving he made the round of the rooms, and
assured himself that, for the moment, Chris was not in them.</p>

<p>When he came out he remembered that on arriving he had left
his suit-case at the station. Oh, well, he thought, Floss was
sure not to be on time; he could easily run down the hill and be
back before she was ready to start. But when he returned to the
hotel the hall porter, after an inspection of the lounge, and a
consultation with the concierge, announced that Miss Delaney had
gone.</p>

<p>Vance felt a moment of vexation. It was only half-past seven.
Had she left no message? Not as far as the porter knew. Vance
repeated the enquiry at the desk. He thought he detected a faint
smile on the face of the gold-braided functionaries. How many
times a day must that question be put to them! "Oh, well--." He
was relieved to find that after all he didn't much care, though a
twinge of vanity shot through his affected indifference.</p>

<p>On the threshold he was detained by a page-boy with a
visiting-card. "The concierge thinks perhaps this is for
you."</p>

<p>On the back of the card, in an untidily pencilled scrawl,
Vance read: "Tell him to come after us." He guessed this cryptic
scribble to be Floss's way of ordering the concierge to send him
in pursuit of her; but, as he had declined to go, the message had
no particular point. He laughed, and absently turned the card
over. On the back was engraved: <i>Duca di Spartivento.</i></p>

<p>"Is it meant for you, sir?" the page asked; and Vance, with a
shrug, pocketed the card and went out.</p>

<p>The Duke of Spartivento! What faint memory-waves did those
sonorous syllables set rippling? Granada--Alders? But of course!
This trumpet of a name was that of the young Italian cousin--or
nephew?--of the old Marquesa to whose <i>tertulia</i> Vance had
gone with Alders. He remembered that the latter, the day he had
come to bid Halo and Vance goodbye, had spoken with his
deprecating smirk of being about to join his Spanish friends for
a shooting party in their cousin's honour, at the Marquesa's
castle in Estremadura...it was then that the splendid name
had shot before him up like a rocket. "Or like a line from the
'Song to David'," he remembered thinking.</p>

<p>Floss's having written her message on the back of that
particular card seemed part of the fairy-tale enveloping him.
Since his meeting with her, and their hour in the little
restaurant, nothing that could happen seemed impossible, or even
unlikely. Amusement conquered his vexation...it was all part
of the fairy-tale. In the darkness already sparkling with lights,
he stood wondering whether he should take the next train to Nice,
or treat himself to a taxi out of his winnings. He decided on the
taxi.</p>

<p>He was about to hail one when he felt another touch on his
arm, and saw at his side a chauffeur in dark livery. "Are you the
gentleman--?" Vance stared, and the chauffeur continued in fluent
English: "Going to Cannes with Miss Delaney, sir? That's right.
Here's her car. She's gone on with the others; but she told me to
wait and bring you." He had his hand on the shining panel of the
motor from which Vance had seen Floss descend that morning; and
Vance obediently got in. Let the fairy-tale go on as long as it
would. When he got to Nice he'd tell the fellow to drop him at
some quiet hotel...</p>

<p>He had no notion which way they were going. From the train he
had seen the road only in uncertain glimpses, climbing between
garden walls or dropping to the sea; and now darkness made the
scene strange. They ascended between illuminated houses; then the
streets ceased, and he found himself high up, flashing past dark
wooded heights and looking across a sea of verdure to the other
sea below, its shore thrust forth in black headlands or ravelled
into long sinuous inlets. The moon had not risen, but the evening
star hung in the sky like a lesser moon, and the early
constellations pushed upward, deepening the night. But only for a
moment; almost at once they paled and vanished in the spreading
of artificial lights that festooned the coast, crested the
headlands, flowed in golden streamers across bays and harbours,
and flashed and revolved from unseen lighthouses, binding the
prone landscape in a net of fire.</p>

<p>Overhead rose a continuous cliff, wooded and sombre; below a
continuous city sparkled and twisted. Vance hung over the scene
entranced. He had no thought of places or distances; as the motor
climbed, descended and rose again, he felt like a bird floating
above the earth, like an errant Perseus swooping down to free
this dark Andromeda from her jewelled chains. Visions and images
pressed on him. They mingled with the actual scene, so that what
his eyes saw, and what his fancy made of it, flowed into one
miracle of night and fire. And now the motor had dropped to the
shore again, and the sea, dim and unbound, swayed away into
blackness. Vance longed to jump out and dash over the sands into
that moving obscurity; but he felt that the incessant shifting of
the scene was the very source of its magic, and leaned back
satisfied.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was aware that the motor was manoeuvring at a
sharp turn. They were out in the country again, or in a leafy
suburb, with gate-ways and house-fronts seen through foliage.
"See here--what about Nice?" he called to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Nice?" the latter echoed, busy with his backing; "this is the
way up to Mrs. Glaisher's. Damned bad corner--"</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's all a mistake. I meant to get out at Nice. Can't
you take me back there?"</p>

<p>"Back to Nice? You never said anything about Nice, sir." The
chauffeur turned his head reproachfully. "What time do you
suppose it is? Nearly half-past nine; and I haven't had no dinner
yet. Have <i>you?"</i> His tone was respectful but aggrieved.
"It's here Miss Delaney said I was to bring you..." The motor
rolled between illuminated gate-posts and along a drive to a
white-pillared portico. "This way," said a footman, who seemed to
have been waiting for Vance from the beginning of time; and Vance
followed his suit-case up a broad flight of marble steps. It was
true--he had forgotten to tell the chauffeur that he wanted to
get out at Nice.</p>

<p>In a hall paved with coloured marbles he saw, redoubled in
tall mirrors, a tired parched-looking self in faded flannel suit
and shabby hat. Other footmen appeared, eyeing him expectantly
yet uncertainly; had it depended on them, their look implied, he
would never have been included in the party. Then a familiar
falsetto exclaimed: "Here he is! D'you remember Alders? My dear
fellow, how are you? Mrs. Glaisher's in the loggia with the
others. Never mind about not being dressed..." It was the same
old Alders, more brushed-up and sleek in his new evening clothes,
but still timid yet familiar, putting Vance at his ease, gently
steering him in the way he should go. Vance smilingly
submitted.</p>

<p>The loggia was a sort of open-air dining-room. Arcaded bays of
plate-glass looked out over a dim garden. In the diffused
candle-glow Vance saw, at a long table, Mrs. Glaisher, Lady
Pevensey, Lorry, and a dozen others: young women with shining
shoulder-blades in soft-coloured dresses, men in evening clothes
with bald or glossily-brushed heads. He recalled the evening
parties to which the Tarrants used to take him, when he was
planning a novel called "Loot", and absorbed in the faces and
fashions of successful worldlings. But here the background
supplied the element of poetry for lack of which the theme had
ceased to interest him. The same trivial, over-dressed and
over-fed people acquired a sort of Titianesque value from the
sheer loveliness of their setting; grouped about the table with
its fruit and flowers, framed in the pink marble shafts of the
loggia, above gardens sloping away to the illuminated curve of
the shore, they became as pictorial as their background, and
Vance's first thought was: "If they only knew enough not to
speak!"</p>

<p>But a plaintive lady in pearls was just declaring: "What I
always say is: If you're going to buy a Rolls-Royce, buy
<i>two</i>...it pays in the end"; and a flushed bald
gentleman across the table affirmed emphatically: "We've run down
a little place <i>at last</i> where you can really count on the
caviar..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Glaisher, from the head of the table, shed an untroubled
welcome on Vance. She too had clearly forgotten that anything had
clouded their previous meeting. "Mr. Weston! This is too
delightful." She held out a fat hand corseted with rings. "No,
no, of course you mustn't dress...Sit down just as you
are--this is pot-luck with a friend or two...Imp, where's Mr.
Weston to sit? Floss, darling, can you make room for him?"</p>

<p>He sat down beside her, dizzy and excited. "I didn't know you
when I first came in," he said. He had never before seen her in
evening dress. For a moment she had been merged in the soft
glitter of the other young women; but now they were all shadowy
beside her, she alone seemed like some warm living substance in a
swaying dream. "I never meant to come," he mumbled,
half-laughing. His throat was dry with excitement; he emptied the
glass of champagne beside his plate. "It was all your chauffeur's
mistake."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you think it was a mistake," she said, with a
little lift of her chin; and he laughed back: "Oh, but I didn't
say it was <i>mine!"</i></p>

<p>Alders beamed over at them in his oblique and furtive way.
Vance felt that Alders regarded him as his property, and the idea
added to the humour of the situation. But in Floss Delaney's
nearness nothing else seemed real or important, and while he ate
and drank, and now and then touched her hand, or drew into his
eyes the curve of her round throat as she tilted back her head,
the chatter about them grew vague as the buzz of insects--as
though the other guests had been great heavy bees gathering to
loot the piled-up fruit and flowers.</p>

<p>Now and then a fragment of talk detached itself; Lorry
haranguing about the future of the ballet, or Lady Pevensey
shrilling out: "Duke, we won't let you carry off Miss Delaney on
the Blemers' yacht unless you'll promise to land her in London
next June. We've got to show her London, you know."</p>

<p>Vance did not know who the Duke was. The dark lean young man
on Mrs. Glaisher's right (of whom Vance was just becoming faintly
aware) gave a dry chuckle, and a large pale man opposite said,
rather self-consciously: "What London wants is to be shown Miss
Delaney." Vance concluded that this gentleman was the Duke, and
wished he had looked more like one of the family portraits at the
Marquesa's.</p>

<p>Miss Delaney seemed to think a faint laugh a sufficient answer
to these comments. Her inarticulateness, which used to make her
seem sullen, had acquired an aesthetic grace. It suited her small
imperial head, the low brow, the heavily-modelled lids and mouth;
and her silence suggested not lack of ease but such
self-confidence that effort was unnecessary.</p>

<p>"It's funny--you're just the way you used to be, yet being so
makes you so different," he said, with small hope of her
understanding; but she replied with a murmur of amusement: "I
don't believe anybody really changes."</p>

<p>"You might have waited for me this evening."</p>

<p>"You said nothing would induce you to come."</p>

<p>He laughed: "I guess you had me abducted, didn't you?" and she
rejoined serenely: "No; I knew I didn't have to."</p>

<p>"Oh, look--" he exclaimed, laying his hand on her warm brown
arm.</p>

<p>Slowly the full moon was lifting her silver round above the
trees. With her rising a subtle alteration transformed the
landscape. The lights along the shore waned and grew blurred, and
the indistinct foreground of the garden began to detach itself in
sculptural masses: wide-branching trees built up like heavy
marble candelabra, alabaster turf edged with silver balustrades,
a jewelled setting of precious metals that framed the moving
silver of the sea.</p>

<p>The talk about the table was struck silent as Mrs. Glaisher's
guests stared at the miracle; but presently some one broke out:
"By Jove, but tonight's the F&ecirc;te of the Fireworks at the
Casino; who's going down to see it?"</p>

<p>There was stir among the company, like the replete diner's
uneasy effort not to miss the culminating dish; then Lorry Spear
broke in with a laugh: "Going down to the Casino to see
fireworks? I should have thought this terrace was the best
proscenium we could find."</p>

<p>The others joined in the laugh, and the diners, when wraps had
been brought, wandered out onto the terrace. The night was mild
and windless; the younger women, rejecting the suggestion of fur
cloaks, stood about in luminous groups of mother-of-pearl. Vance
had followed Floss Delaney, but two or three other men joined
her, and he drew back, content to watch her as she leaned on the
balustrade of the terrace, a gauze scarf silvering her shoulders,
her arms shining through it like pale amber. The beauty of the
night purged his mind of the troubled thoughts his meeting with
her had stirred, and he felt her presence only as part of the
general harmony.</p>

<p>A long "Oh-h" broke from the watchers. Far below the villa sea
and horizon became suddenly incandescent; then a dawn-like
radiance effaced the fires, and when that vanished every corner
of the night was arched with streamers and rainbows of flashing
colour. Through them, as they shot up and crossed each other in
celestial trellisings, the moon looked down in wonder. Now she
seemed a silver fish caught in a golden net, now a great orange
on a tree full of blossoms, or a bird of Paradise in a cage of
sapphires and rubies--yet so aloof, so serenely remote, that she
seemed to smile down goddess-like at the tangle of earthly
lights, as though she were saying: "Are those multi-coloured
sparks really what the people on that little planet think the
stars are like? Funny earth-children, amusing themselves down
there with a toy-sky while up here we gods of the night are
fulfilling our round unnoticed." Yet while she mused, he saw that
she too changed colour with the change of lights, turning now
blush-red, now gold, now pearl, like a goddess who reddens and
pales because Actaeon has looked at her...Somehow that
wondering moon, going her cool way alone, yet blushing and
faltering in the tangle of earth-lights, suddenly reminded him of
Halo.</p>

<p>"It's getting as cold as Greenland out here," one of the women
exclaimed. "What's the matter with indoors and bridge?"</p>

<p>The guests trailed back, chattering and laughing, and through
the windows Vance saw the footmen opening the card-tables and
laying out the cards. He was about to follow when the thin dark
young man who had sat at Mrs. Glaisher's right strolled up,
holding out a cigar-case in a lean family-portrait-like hand.
"Have one?" Vance's acceptance called to the other's narrow
vertical face a smile lit up by perfect teeth: one would have
supposed that in taking a cigar Vance had done him a quite
exceptional favour. The smile persisted. "You make a good deal of
money out of your books, I presume?" the young man continued,
speaking English with a foreign accent to which a marked nasal
twang was oddly super-added. The question jolted Vance out of his
dream, and before he could answer the other continued earnestly:
"Pardon <i>me</i> if I ask. Of course I know of your celebrity;
your sales must be colossal--not? But very often you successful
brilliant artists don't know how to invest your earnings. If that
is your case I should be most happy to offer you expert advice.
There are a number of opportunities on the market today for any
one who's got the nerve to get in on the ground floor..."</p>

<p>"Duke--Duke! We're waiting for you to make up Mrs. Glaisher's
table," Imp Pevensey's voice shrilled out across the terrace.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell--" remarked the dark young man, in an untroubled
voice; adding, as he drew a card from his pocket: "If you require
advice I guess we can fix you up as good as anybody. What my firm
is after is to cater to the <i>&eacute;lite,</i> social and
artistic. So long!" He pressed the card in Vance's hand, and the
latter read on it, wondering:</p>

<p> </p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When Vance came down the next morning none of Mrs. Glaisher's
other guests were visible. Even Alders, no doubt engrossed in
secretarial business, did not show himself; but the night before,
when Vance had questioned him about Chris Churley, he had said
instantly: "Ah, you know Chris? So much the better. I was going
to ask if you wouldn't give him an interview--for an article in
the 'Windmill', you know."</p>

<p>Vance laughed. "Yes, I do know; and I gave him the interview a
good many weeks ago."</p>

<p>Alders wrinkled his brows deprecatingly. "Ah--there it is! No
results, I suppose? A genius--certainly a touch of genius, eh?
But can't be pinned down. He begged me to get him a chance to see
Gratz Blemer, and though Blemer's shy of publicity at present (or
<i>she</i> is, rather) I did persuade them that 'The Rush Hour'
ought to be written about in the 'Windmill', and Chris spent an
afternoon on the yacht--enjoying it immensely, by the way; but as
for the article, nothing came of it. Blemer keeps on asking me
when he's to see the copy; and what can I answer, when I can't
even get hold of Churley?"</p>

<p>"Ah--you can't get hold of him?"</p>

<p>"Vanished--like an absconding cashier. Some fellow saw him
playing in the baccarat room at Monte Carlo; but I've looked in
two or three times without finding him. And of course I don't
know his address. I daresay, though, he'll bob up when he hears
you're here."</p>

<p>Vance had good reasons for not thinking so; but there seemed
nothing to do but to prosecute his search at Monte Carlo, since
it was there that Chris had last been seen. A confidential
enquiry at the police-station might possibly give some result;
but in a big city like Nice the boy would be harder to trace.</p>

<p>Vance was still dizzy with the translation from Oubli-sur-Mer
to the Villa Mirifique. Floss Delaney, unreal as the setting in
which he had found her, seemed the crowning improbability of the
adventure. But the villa, at any rate, was substantial. The
morning sun, robbing it of its magic, merely turned it into an
expensive-looking house from which splendour and poetry had fled.
As he paced the terrace above the over-ornamented gardens Vance
asked himself if he should have the same disillusionment when he
saw Miss Delaney again. On the very spot where he now paused to
light his cigarette he had stood beside her the night before
while the moon turned her bare arms to amber. He had promised to
meet her, with the rest of the party, that evening at Monte
Carlo; they were to dine, he didn't remember where, with the fat
pale man he had taken for the Duke of Spartivento, and who turned
out to be somebody infinitely more important, an oil or railway
king, Alders explained.</p>

<p>Vance had had only a short exchange of words with Alders when
the party broke up, for the secretary had to hurry away to
arrange for the morrow. Alders had undergone a curious
transformation. In spite of all that the best tailoring could do
he was as mothlike and furtive as ever; but under his apologetic
manner Vance felt a new assurance, perhaps founded on financial
security. Alders's literary earnings, he explained to Vance (who
wondered by what they were produced), had become too precarious;
in these uncertain times his publishers would give him no promise
regarding the big book he had long been planning (Vance would
remember?) on Ignatius Loyola...no, on El Greco; and his own
small income having unfortunately diminished, he had accepted the
post of secretary to Mrs. Glaisher rather than become a burden on
his friends. He added that his wide range of acquaintances
enabled him to be of some service to his employer, who, like the
illustrious women of the Renaissance ("there's something of the
Sforzas about her, I always think,") wanted to know every one
eminent in rank or talent, and had shown herself very
appreciative of his guidance. "Of course," Alders explained, in
the same tone of timid fastidiousness in which Vance had heard
him dilate on the Valencian primitives, or the capitals of Santo
Domingo de Silos--"of course it's easy, even for women of Mrs.
Glaisher's discernment, to be taken in by the flashy adventurers
who are always trying to force their way into rich people's
houses; and I do my best to protect her. As you see, the set she
has about her would be distinguished anywhere...Sir Felix
Oster (the stout pale man on her left at dinner; a Napoleonic
head, I often say)--Sir Felix very seldom troubles himself to go
to other people's houses. We're all dining with him tonight, at
the new restaurant up at La Turbie; and as for my old friend, the
Duke of Spartivento--he was tremendously excited at meeting you,
my dear Weston--told me he'd heard all about your books; well, in
the Duke's case," Alders summed up with his faint sketch of a
smile, "I begin to think that in introducing him here I may have
done him an even bigger service than I have his hostess." Alders
laid his hands together with the devotional gesture Vance had
seen him make in the presence of works of art. "An Italian Duke
and a grandee of Spain...all I can say is, the prize is
worthy of the effort."</p>

<p>At Alders's words a pang shot through Vance. What was the
prize, and whose was to be the effort? Instantly he imagined that
he had seen Alders's Duke watching Floss Delaney between his
narrowed lids. And what was it that Lady Pevensey had said about
the Duke's carrying Floss off for a cruise with the Gratz
Blemers? A wave of jealousy buzzed in Vance's ears. Jealousy
could outlive love, then, cling to it like a beast of prey to a
carcase for which it no longer hungered? He had never loved
Floss, in the sense in which he now understood loving; and he
imagined that his fugitive passion had long since turned to
loathing. Yet that night, while he tossed between the scented
sheets of Mrs. Glaisher's guest-room, he could not shake off the
torment. Floss Delaney--she was less than nothing to him! But the
idea that other men coveted her made his flesh burn though his
heart was cold...Why subject himself to further misery? What
had he and she to do with each other? If he had not pledged
himself to find Chris Churley he would have jumped into the first
train for Oubli. Instead, when he had taken leave of Floss he had
agreed to dine the next night with Alders's railway king in order
to have another chance of meeting her. In the morning light,
after coffee, and a stroll on Mrs. Glaisher's terrace, the
situation seemed less lurid. He decided that if he spent the day
hunting for Chris he had the right to an amusing evening, and
that there was no reason why Floss's presence should prevent his
taking it. She was only one pretty woman among the many at Mrs.
Glaisher's; it was long since he had been among the
flower-maidens, and now that the chance had come why should he
fly from them?</p>

<p>He took the first train to Nice and went to the
Pr&eacute;fecture de Police. Chris's name was unknown there, but
Vance's description was noted down, and the sergeant said that
they might have some information the next day. Vance continued
his journey to Monte Carlo, where he made the same enquiries;
then he decided that, the lunch hour being at hand, his best
chance of finding Chris was to look for him in the fashionable
restaurants. If he had carried away any winnings he was pretty
sure to be spending them where caviar and new asparagus were to
be had; if not, to be enjoying these delicacies at the expense of
others. Vance went first to the restaurant which Floss had
pointed out as the most sought after.</p>

<p>It was so full that the guests, overflowing onto the terrace,
sat wedged under bright awnings and umbrellas; but Vance scanned
the crowd in vain for a dark face with a mop of orange-coloured
hair. He was about to seek out a more modest ordinary for himself
when an elderly gentleman in smartly-cut homespun and a carefully
assorted tie began to wave the <i>carte du jour</i> in his
direction.</p>

<p>This gentleman, before whom head-waiter and <i>sommelier</i>
were obsequiously drawn up, had a sallow complexion, weak
handsome features and tremulous lids above eyes of the same gray
as his thinnish hair and moustache. He might have been a
long-since-retired American diplomatist, or the gentlemanly man
in a bank who explains to flustered ladies why they mustn't draw
a cheque when there's nothing to draw against. He looked either
part to perfection, and Vance was wavering between the two when
he heard himself hailed in a slow southern drawl. "Why, for the
Lord's sake, if it isn't young Weston! Come right over here, my
son, and let's open a bottle of wine to celebrate our escape from
Crampton!"</p>

<p>It was Harrison Delaney, looking up at him with the same slow
ironic twinkle that was like the reflection of his voice. Vance
saw him lounging in the dreary room of the little house at
Crampton, between his whisky-bottle, his dog-eared copy of Pope,
and the ledger which lack of use had kept immaculate. As a
real-estate agent Delaney had been Euphoria's most famous
failure. Lorin Weston used to say that if there hadn't been any
other way for him to lose his money he'd have dug a hole in the
ground and buried it--that is, if he'd ever had the guts to dig.
By the time Vance was meeting Floss down the lane her father had
long since abandoned the struggle, and Euphoria remembered him
only when there was a distinguished stranger to be received or an
oration to be delivered. Then, shaved, pomaded and tall-hatted
for the occasion, Delaney was drawn from his obscurity by a
community dimly conscious that, freely as it applied the title,
he was in reality its only gentleman. After all, a man who quoted
Pope and Horace the way Lorin Weston quoted prices on the Stock
Exchange did give his home town a sort of proprietary
satisfaction; and when a fortune suddenly fell into Delaney's lap
the people who were not envious of him said: "Well, he'll know
how to spend it anyhow."</p>

<p>Apparently he did; at any rate in a way to impress some of the
most eminent head-waiters in Europe. In the act of discussing the
relative merits of <i>oeufs aux truffes blanches</i> and
<i>demoiselles de Caen</i> he paused and waved Vance to the seat
facing him. "Here, waiter--where's that wine card? You choose for
yourself, young fellow. My palate's too burnt out by whisky to be
much good in selecting Bordeaux or Burgundies. But champagne,
now--what, no champagne? Well, this fellow here recommends a
white Musigny--what'd you say the year was, waiter?"</p>

<p>These details being settled in a leisurely and emphatic style,
Mr. Delaney leaned back and scrutinized Vance thoughtfully over
his cocktail. The impression Vance received was of a man who had
merely transposed the terms of his inactivity. He had leaned back
in just the same way in his rocking-chair at Crampton, or among
his cronies at the Elkington House or Mandel's grocery, the thumb
of one long distinguished-looking hand thrust into the armhole of
his waistcoat, and a cigar meditatively twirled in the other. The
only difference was that the hands were now carefully manicured,
that the waistcoat was cut by a master, the cigar heavily belted
with gold. Mr. Delaney looked out on the world with the same
ironic and disenchanted eye. He told Vance he was having a good
time, but not as good a time as he'd expected. Now that they had
plenty of money Floss would insist on dragging him around from
one country to another, though he guessed she found all the
places they'd been to were pretty much the same when you got
there; he was sure he did. He guessed nowadays you could see all
there was to see in the world if you just took a season ticket at
the nearest movie-show. The only difference he could make out
between all the places he'd seen was the way the barman mixed the
cocktails--and the way some of 'em did it made you think they'd
never tasted anything stronger than their mother's milk.</p>

<p>Florence (Mr. Delaney continued) seemed to think you ought to
go round and see the real places. When she got to them he didn't
believe she got much of a kick out of it; not unless there were a
lot of fellows for her to dance with; but after the bad time
she'd had when she was growing up he felt he owed it to her to
let her have her way. As for him, when their tour was over he was
going home to buy back one of the old Delaney farms near
Richmond, and settle down there. The kind of life he wanted to
lead was just what his father and grandfather had led before him:
breed a few trotting-horses, and have a little shooting behind a
couple of good dogs. He guessed that was as far as he'd ever got
in the way of ambition...</p>

<p>Vance listened curiously. This man, who had been so familiar a
part of his early memories, now detached himself as an alien
being, never really identified with Euphoria, and nursing an
indolent contempt for place and people even when these most
righteously looked down on him. "Funny--I never could get any
kick out of all that moral urge," he said with a reminiscent
smile.</p>

<p>Vance laughed, and Delaney, his tongue loosened by the
Burgundy he affected not to appreciate, went on more
confidentially: "Fact is, I see now that I enjoy money as much as
any of your model citizens; the only difference is that I never
thought it worth sweating for. Floss, now--well, she wouldn't
agree. She says money's her god, and I guess it is...She says
it's the only thing that'll get her what she wants; and what she
wants is the earth, or pretty near. Anything that stands out,
that sticks up so that you can see it from way off--brains or
titles or celebrity. I guess there's nothing on God's earth as
undemocratic as a good-looking American girl." Mr. Delaney paused
to go through the agreeable operation of cutting and lighting a
fresh Corona. "Sometimes I feel like saying to all these grandees
she's got round her: You think she's all impulse, do you? Got to
get things the very minute she wants 'em? Well...you wait and
see her stow away those impulses if they interfere with any of
her plans. Sometimes, you know, Weston, I think the inside of my
daughter is a combination of a ticker and a refrigerator. Of
course I don't say this for her old friends...but when I see
these Counts and Marquises getting worked up about her, well, I
have to lean back and laugh."</p>

<p>He did lean back and laugh, fixing his watery eyes on Vance.
Floss, it appeared, the very day he'd made his unexpected
turn-over, had taken command of it--and of him. Why, Vance
wouldn't believe it maybe, but she'd invested and re-invested
that money so that the capital had already doubled. And when she
brought him the result of the first year's earnings she made him
buy an annuity for himself, and draw up a deed turning over all
the rest to her. Well, perhaps he'd been a little rash...but,
as Vance knew, a quiet life was all he'd ever asked for. And
Floss was a good daughter--a devoted daughter--if only you let
her have her way. She'd try to break him of his bad
habits--whisky and poker--and when she found she couldn't she
just read the riot act, and before he knew it he'd signed the
papers, and now they were on the best of terms, and she was glad
enough to have him around with her. "Says it looks
better--besides, you know, damn it, the child's fond of me," Mr.
Delaney concluded emotionally.</p>

<p>Vance listened under a painful fascination. He could not
reconcile Mr. Delaney's picture--or, rather, perhaps, he did not
want to--with the capricious girl, cynical yet passionate, who
had set him aflame in a past already so remote. But he reflected
that Delaney's was probably a one-sided version. Floss, aware of
her father's failings, had naturally wanted to put their suddenly
acquired wealth out of his reach, and Delaney, for all his
affected indifference, doubtless resented her domination. But
Vance could not talk of her with her father. Too many memories
stirred in him; and when he had finished his coffee he got up and
took his leave. His host seemed surprised and disappointed. "Off
already? Why, what's your hurry?" he said plaintively. "I never
know how to get through these blamed everlasting days. Nothing
doing in the baccarat rooms before five." But happily two
middle-aged gentlemen with expensive clothes and red
innocent-looking faces came up and hailed him, and Mr. Delaney,
explaining that they were two fellows from Buffalo that he'd made
friends with in Egypt, moved on with them contentedly to the
nearest bar.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Vance had promised Floss to be at her hotel at eight. She had
told him she would stop there to pick him up on her way from
Cannes to Sir Felix Oster's dinner at La Turbie. "Unless," she
mocked, "you'd rather go with Mrs. Glaisher?"</p>

<p>"Well, I would, unless you'll promise to have nobody else with
you." As he spoke, the blood rushed to his temples, and he
thought: "You fool--what did you say that for?" But she returned,
in her cool unsmiling way: "Come and see," and at the challenge
his blood hummed. After all, if she didn't turn up, or if she had
some of the other men with her, he would just turn on his heel
and go off and dine by himself. This decision made him feel
extraordinarily resolute and self-confident.</p>

<p>His self-confidence waned during the unavailing search for
Chris. He had decided, in any case, to return to Oubli the next
morning, leaving the quest to the police; and to fortify his
resolve had telegraphed the hour of his arrival to Halo. But
meanwhile the sense of depending on Floss Delaney's whim made the
time weigh on him as heavily as it did on her father, and long
before eight he was in the lounge of her hotel.</p>

<p>The hour came and passed; but twenty minutes later her motor
drove up, and Vance saw that she was alone. He was astonished at
his own excitement as he plunged down the steps to meet her. He
saw her lean forward to wave to him, the porter opened the door,
he was at her side, and they were driving away. "It won't last
ten minutes," the pulses in his temples kept dinning into his
brain. He had found out where La Turbie was, had looked up at the
new restaurant from the Casino square. On its towering cliff it
glittered close above them like a giant light-house--a few turns
of the wheels, and the motor would be there. And the next morning
he would be on his way back to Oubli--what a trifle to have made
all this fuss about!</p>

<p>"Well--am I a good girl?" his companion said, touching his arm
as the motor began to work its way through the crowd about the
Casino.</p>

<p>"When you asked me to go with you I didn't know the place
we're going to was just up that hill," he growled. "We'll be
there before we can turn round."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help that, can I?"</p>

<p>"If there'd been a longer way to go you'd have taken one of
the other fellows...Why didn't you wait last night, and drive
me to Mrs. Glaisher's, as you said you would?"</p>

<p>"Why, I wanted to--honest I did. But Spartivento said I'd
promised to try out his new Bugatti racer with him."</p>

<p>"Promising don't cost you much--never did. You'd promised
me."</p>

<p>"I'll promise now to go off with you tomorrow for the whole
afternoon--just you and me: we'll go wherever you like. Will that
satisfy you?"</p>

<p>He laughed impatiently. "It won't make any difference one way
or the other. I've got to go home tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"Oh,--<i>home,"</i> she mimicked, with an undefinable accent
in which irony seemed blent with a just perceptible
resentment.</p>

<p>"Yes; home," he repeated with insistence.</p>

<p>She gave a low laugh. "Why, Van, your voice sounds just the
way it did the days I was late, when we used to meet down by the
river. But I guess you're so celebrated now you don't
remember."</p>

<p>"So celebrated--!" He felt a lump in his throat. She ought not
to have reminded him of those meetings--she ought not to...</p>

<p>"Well, you are celebrated, aren't you? Everybody's talking
about you. I don't know why you should remember me; but I want
you to." She leaned nearer, her hand on his. "Van, don't be
cross. I was the first, wasn't I? Say you remember."</p>

<p>"I remember well enough the day I saw you down there
with--somebody else," he said in a choking voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Van--" She swung suddenly round on him. "All I remember
is the days I was there with you. Those first days...how hot
it was that summer...and there was a weed or grass that smelt
so good...Van, say you remember!" Her bare arms were about
him, her lips on his. The old glory flooded him, and everything
was full of bells chiming, and stars dancing through wind-swayed
trees. "Tomorrow," she said against his lips.</p>

<p> </p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The illuminated room, the many faces, whirled about Vance.
Ahead of him Floss Delaney's brown shoulders flashed like the
dryad's in the Fontainebleau woods; he heard familiar voices, saw
Mrs. Glaisher armoured in diamonds, Lady Pevensey's dry sparkle
("She looks like a cocktail," the novelist in him noted), and the
dull enigma of Sir Felix Oster's full-moon countenance.</p>

<p>"We thought you two were lost," Mrs. Glaisher simpered; and
Alders, fluttering up, whispered: "He's here, you know...such
luck! I do hope you'll persuade him to do that Blemer article
before they leave..."</p>

<p>And there was Chris.</p>

<p>Clearly he had not expected to meet Vance. He turned pale
under his sallowness, then flushed to the roots of his
orange-tawny hair. But his disturbance was only skin-deep; his
eye remained cool, his smile undaunted. This was a new Chris, the
man-of-the-world twin of the unhappy changeling of Oubli: evening
clothes, sleeked hair, the lustre of his linen, transformed him
into the ornamental frequenter of fashionable entertainments. "We
always try to secure an author or two: Mr. Churley's one of the
new literary critics, isn't he--on the 'Owl', or the 'Windmill',
or something?" Lady Pevensey threw off, catching Vance's signal
to Chris.</p>

<p>"Well--so you're here?" said Vance, laughing; and the other
responded glibly: "Such luck! When I heard you were coming
tonight I chucked another engagement..." ("Liar!" thought
Vance, more amused than indignant). "Fact is, you're the very man
I want to get hold of," Chris continued on a tidal rush of
assurance. "You know Blemer, I suppose? Just as I was starting
for London the 'Windmill' wired me that he was at Cannes, and
told me to try to pick up an interview before I left the Riviera.
Lucky job, getting the wire just as I was shaking the dust of
Oubli from my feet," he grinned complacently. "But now that I've
seen Blemer I--well, frankly, you might just as well ask a fellow
to write an article about a fountain-pen. That's all Blemer
appears to be: his own fountain-pen. Where's the man behind it?
Haven't an idea! Have you? Alders says you know him, and it's a
God-send my running across you, for I was just going to chuck the
whole thing and start for London. If you'll let me go home with
you tonight we might talk Blemer over, and I could get an inkling
of what to say about him."</p>

<p>Vance was tempted to retort: "Have you got an inkling from
Blemer of what to say about me?"--but the party was moving toward
the lamp-hung loggia where the tables were set. "All right--come
in tonight." He turned to follow his host, and Churley was
absorbed in the group about another table.</p>

<p>Vance was with Lady Pevensey, and a pretty young woman on his
right was soon deluging him with literary raptures. He had to
listen again to all the old questions: were his novels inspired
by things that had really happened, or did they just "come to
him"? And his characters--would he mind telling her who the
people really were? Of course she knew novelists always pretended
they invented their characters--but wouldn't he be a darling, and
just whisper to her some of the real names of the people in his
books? And the love-scenes--she did so long to know how far the
novelist had to <i>live</i> his love-scenes; in "The Puritan in
Spain", for instance, there was that marvellous chapter in
Valencia--oh, yes, she knew some people called it morbid, but she
just adored it--where, after being with the dancer all night, the
hero comes out into the street at daylight, just as the funeral
of the woman who'd really loved him is passing...Had anything
as tremendous as that actually happened in his own life? Because
she'd heard people say that a novelist couldn't describe such
things unless...</p>

<p>Across the lights and flowers Vance caught sight of Floss. She
was at Sir Felix's table with Mrs. Glaisher. Next to her sat the
Duke of Spartivento; her lids were lowered as he spoke to her.
She wore a dress of some thin silver tissue, against which her
arms and shoulders looked like sun-warmed marble. There was a
bowl of silver-white gardenias in the middle of the table, and
her neighbour reached over to it and drew out a cluster which she
fastened on her breast. At another table Chris, flushed and
handsome, was discoursing to Alders about the art of
interviewing. As Sir Felix's Pommery circulated the spirits of
the guests bubbled up with it, and talk and laughter drowned the
pulsations of the harp and violin in the balcony. Outside,
modelled by the rising moon, the couchant landscape stretched its
Sphinx-like paws upon the sea.</p>

<p>Vance was seized by the longing to be alone with
Floss--chatter silenced, lights extinguished, only he and she
lifted above the world on a moon-washed height. But the dinner
went on: more truffles, more champagne, more noise; and when it
was over, and the party trailed out onto the terrace, as they had
the night before at Mrs. Glaisher's, some one exclaimed: "Oh, but
there are no fireworks tonight, are there? Don't let's stay out
here in the cold for nothing..."</p>

<p>Floss was one of the first to re-enter the illuminated room.
Bridge-tables were being set out where the party had feasted, and
part of the floor had been cleared for dancing. Two cabaret
professionals were already weaving their arabesques in the centre
of the spectators, and others awaited their turn in the
background. Vance went up to Floss, who stood watching the
dancers.</p>

<p>"Don't you hate this? Aren't you fed up with it? Why won't you
come away with me now?"</p>

<p>She turned with slightly-lifted brows. "Why, aren't we all
going away presently? There's a cabaret down at Monte, something
fearfully exciting, with the new Bali dancers. You must come
along, of course..."</p>

<p>"That's not what I mean. Come off with me now, up here on the
mountain. It's heaven out there with the moon--" Sir Felix was
advancing toward them with a dapper gentleman wearing a single
eye-glass. "Miss Delaney, may I introduce the Marquis
d'Apremont?" "Well, give me one of those gardenias then," Vance
persisted boyishly as she turned with a smile to the newcomer.
She shrugged her brown shoulders, and he walked away and wandered
out alone onto the terrace. What was he doing in that rubbishy
crowd, and why didn't he dash down the mountain and take the
first train to Oubli? What a fool he had been to imagine that
Floss would leave in the middle of a party to go out with him
alone into the wilderness! The night air was sharp at that
height, and he re-entered the restaurant, determined to leave as
soon as he had had a final word with Chris. But Chris was dancing
with the pretty woman who was interested in novelists, and Mrs.
Glaisher executing a slow fox-trot under the accomplished
guidance of the Duke of Spartivento. Vance leaned in the doorway
and watched the revolving couples. Floss was not dancing; she sat
in a corner, a group of men about her; from where Vance stood he
noticed that she spoke little, smiled even more rarely, but sat
there, composed, almost indifferent, while the faces about her
shone with curiosity and admiration. And he had been fatuous
enough to think that she would exchange that homage for a
moonlight ramble with an obscure scribbler!</p>

<p>When the party began to break up he roused himself to look for
Chris. "You'll come down to my hotel now?" he suggested; but
Chris gave a deprecating gesture. "Straight away? Awfully sorry;
but Mrs. Glaisher's taking us on to the cabaret. You're not
coming? I say, that's too bad. What's your hotel? Do you mind if
I drop in on you tonight rather latish? If you're turned in I
won't disturb you--"</p>

<p>"I shan't have turned in; come up, no matter how late it is,"
Vance insisted; and the other rejoined with his bright
plausibility: "Thanks a lot! It'll be the greatest help; somehow
or other I've got to grind out that article...There's Mrs.
Glaisher wig-wagging at us. Who's driving you down? Miss
Delaney?"</p>

<p>But Vance, plunging out through the swinging doors, strode
away alone. At the stream of motors flowed by in the moonlight he
recognized Floss Delaney's, and for a mad moment thought she had
seen him and was signing to her chauffeur to stop; but she was
only lifting her little mirror with one hand while with the other
she retouched her lips. In the shadow he caught the gleam of a
shirt-front, the outline of a man's head; then the motor swept
on.</p>

<p>Vance waited in vain for Chris Churley. He left his door
unlocked, and sat in the darkness smoking and listening; but
Chris's was not among the footsteps passing down the hotel
corridor in the small hours, and toward daylight Vance undressed
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>He woke late and gloomily. The sun, pouring in at his
unshuttered window, roused him to a violent contact with reality.
What had he hoped and imagined the night before? A feverish
escapade with this girl who had sent through him the same shock
as when he had first known her? Only a few hours ago her lips had
been on his, her arms about him, her whole body breathing
promises; an hour or two later she had turned from him with a
shrug, without even an allusion to her own proposal that they
should spend the next afternoon together. She would never think
of that promise again; she had not even told him where they were
to meet, had seen him go without a word of reminder. Once she was
back at the Villa Mirifique, and caught up in the old round of
pleasure, he would pass out of her life as he had before.</p>

<p>But while reason argued thus, the thought that his real self
was pursuing was simply: "Who was the man she drove back with her
from La Turbie?" At one moment that question was gnawing him, at
another he was saying to himself: "Well, what of it, and what
business is it of mine? There's no novelty in finding out again
what she is--I knew it well enough before. And supposing I'd been
the man she went off with, should I have felt any differently
about her?" The residue of it all was a sick disgust, a revolt
from life such as he had felt when he had seen her down by the
river with his grandfather. She seemed to distil a poison such as
no other woman secreted; his veins were so heavy with it that he
felt like a man recovering from a long illness. "Oh, well, I must
get up and get home," he thought, and dragged himself unwillingly
out of bed.</p>

<p>It was not till then that he remembered Chris--Chris, who had
not come the night before, whose address, like a fool, he had
forgotten to take, and who had doubtless given him the slip
again. He dressed in a cold rage against himself, against the
world and against Chris--and was just turning to leave his room
when the culprit entered.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c24">XXIV</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He was not the brilliant Chris of the previous night, but a
down-cast being whose pale face and heavy eyes seemed to reflect
Vance's own distress. He held out his hand in silence, and Vance
asked if he had breakfasted.</p>

<p>Chris grimaced a refusal. "But a brandy-and-soda? Thanks.
Shall I telephone the order?"</p>

<p>He did so without waiting for the answer; then he threw
himself into the one armchair in the room, lit a cigarette, and
looked absently about him, as though hardly conscious of Vance's
presence. "Not a bad place you've got here." He puffed at his
cigarette, and added suddenly: "Funny chap, that Duke of
Spartivento. Who do you suppose he's out to marry?"</p>

<p>"I don't know--nor much care," Vance replied, with a quick
twinge of apprehension.</p>

<p>"Well--Mrs. Glaisher! Didn't you see him dancing with her last
night? I suppose he noticed I was rather chummy with Alders, and
might be likely to know something about the lady's affairs; so he
got me off into a corner to ask about her investments--of course
on the pretext that he represents a stock-broking firm.
Up-to-date fellow, the Duke. Naturally I told him I knew all
about it; you ought to have seen his eyes as I piled up the
millions! I wouldn't have missed it for a good deal." Chris's own
eyes brightened with the appearance of the brandy-and-soda, and
he reached out to pour himself a stiff draught.</p>

<p>Vance watched him impatiently. At the moment the boy inspired
him only with contempt. "Well, suppose we get down to business
now," he suggested, as Chris leaned back in silent enjoyment of
his drink.</p>

<p>The word seemed to strike a tender nerve. The blood flooded up
under Chris's sallow skin, as it had the night before when he
caught sight of Vance. "Business--?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell me you wanted me to help you with your
article on Blemer?"</p>

<p>"Oh--<i>that?"</i> Vance caught his look of relief. "Why, yes,
of course...Blemer..." With pleasurable deliberation Chris
helped himself to another brandy-and-soda. "I haven't written the
first line of that article on Blemer."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Nor of the article on you--"</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No--no--no! Damn it, Weston, I suppose you knew from the
beginning that I never would." Chris jumped up and began to move
uneasily about the room. He halted before Vance. "And it was all
a yarn, you know, what I told you last night about the 'Windmill'
having wired me to come here and interview Blemer. The purest
kind of a lie. Much the 'Windmill' cares! They washed their hands
of me long ago. I daresay you guessed that too. You knew I'd
taken the money you lent me to go to London with, and come here
to blow it in--didn't you?"</p>

<p>Vance was silent, and Chris rushed on with twitching lips: "I
daresay you heard of my being here from Alders or somebody, and
came to look me up and see how I'd invested your loan, eh?" He
gave a laugh. "Well, the last penny of it went up the spout last
night."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a loan," said Vance.</p>

<p>Chris broke off with a stare. "It wasn't--?"</p>

<p>"I hate loans--to myself or others. The day after you told me
you wanted to go to London I looked you up to tell you so. You'd
already gone, and I didn't know where to write; but the money was
a present, so there's an end of it. It's your own look-out how
you spent it; you don't even owe me an explanation."</p>

<p>Chris received this in silence. He had grown very pale, and
his lower lip trembled. "I say, Weston--." He turned away and
throwing himself down sideways in the armchair buried his face in
his crossed arms. "Oh, God, oh, God!" It was such an explosion of
misery as had burst from him when he had confessed to Vance his
desperate desire to get away from Oubli. Vance's contempt gave
way to pity; but he hardly knew how to put it into words without
touching on a live nerve. Chris looked up again. "Well, I don't
suppose you're much surprised, are you? I daresay you knew from
the first that I wasn't serious about the 'Windmill'."</p>

<p>"No; I didn't. And I still believe you meant to go to
London."</p>

<p>"You do?" The mockery in Chris's eyes vanished in a look of
boyish compunction. "Well, you're right; I did. But just as I was
getting my ticket there was a fellow next to me taking his for
Nice. And the sun was shining...and I hate fog and cold...
they shrivel me up...Oh, Weston, what am I to do? I can't
write--I <i>can't.</i> I can only dream of it. I knew I'd never
earn enough in London to pay back your twenty pounds, and that
with any kind of luck I might give myself a month's holiday here
and settle my debt besides. So I came...and I did make money
enough, or nearly; only like a fool I blew in part of it the day
before yesterday. And last night I went back to try and recoup,
and come to you with the cash in my pocket; and I struck my first
run of bad luck, and got cleaned out." He gave another of his
shrill laughs, stood up and limped across to the mirror over the
mantel. "Pretty sight I am...I look like an old print of 'The
Gamester'. By God, I wish I was an old print--I might sell myself
for a pound or two!" He turned toward Vance. "The fact is, I was
meant to be a moment's ornament, and you all insist on my being a
permanent institution," he said with a whimsical grin.</p>

<p>"Well, you've ornamented several moments by this time," said
Vance. "The best thing you can do now is to pack up and come back
with me."</p>

<p>"Back--to Oubli?"</p>

<p>"Of course. All that rot about not writing--why, nobody can
write who doesn't set his teeth and dig himself in. Your mistake
was ever imagining it was fun. Come along; you'll write fast
enough when you have to."</p>

<p>Chris stood twirling a cigarette between his fingers. His
hands shook like an old man's. "I say, Weston--you've been
awfully decent. And I wonder if you won't understand--if you
won't help me out this once...Not a big loan; just a few
pounds. It'll be the last time...After that I'll go
back."</p>

<p>"You'll come back now. Your mother's out of her senses
worrying about you; it's not fair to keep her in suspense."</p>

<p>Chris dropped down into the chair again, limp and
expressionless as a marionette with broken wires. "Look here,"
Vance began--but the other interrupted him. He knew all that
Vance was going to say, he declared; hadn't he said it to himself
a thousand times? But he was sick of pretending that he ought to
buckle down to work, that he oughtn't to borrow money, that he
ought to be kind to his parents, and not worry them out of their
senses. What was the good of it all, when he didn't happen to be
made that way? Talk of ineffectual angels--there were ineffectual
devils too, and he was one of them. Didn't Vance suppose he knew
what he was made for--to talk well, and make people laugh, and
get asked out where there was jazz and fun and cards? Some
millionaire's hanger-on--that was what he was meant to be; and
yet he wasn't either, because he couldn't stand being ordered
about, or pretend to be amused by stupid people, or dazzled by
vulgar asses, or any of the things you were expected to do in
return for your keep. In his heart of hearts he'd rather slave in
an editor's office than nigger for rich morons as poor Alders
did--an educated fellow, not half stupid, but who didn't know how
else to earn his living. For his part, he'd rather give himself a
hypo and be done with it...</p>

<p>"You might try slaving in an editor's office before you plump
for the hypo," Vance answered. His compassion was cooling off.
The perpetual spring of energy bubbling up in him made such
weakness and self-pity almost incomprehensible. He could
understand the rich morons getting themselves privately
electrocuted, he said; after a day or two in their company he
always wondered why they didn't. But to a man like Chris, with
eyes and a brain, the mere everyday spectacle of life ought to...</p>

<p>"The wind on the heath?" Chris interpolated drily.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, damn it--the wind..." But the argument died on
Vance's lips. Life wasn't like that to Chris's decomposing
intelligence. His eyes and his brain seemed to drain the beauty
out of daily things; there was the bitter core of the enigma.</p>

<p>Vance laid his hand on the boy's shoulder. "Listen, old man;
your people are awfully unhappy. Come home; we'll see what can be
done afterward."</p>

<p>Chris looked up with heavy eyes. "Now--today?"</p>

<p>"By the next train. I can't think why you're not fed up with
this sort of thing. I am."</p>

<p>Chris sat staring down at his idle trembling hands. "You're a
brick, Weston--"</p>

<p>"Oh, stow all that. Where's your hotel? Go along and pack up,
and I'll call for you in half an hour." But suddenly Vance
reflected: "If I let him go, ten to one I'll never find him
again.--Look here," he said, "just wait till I pitch my things
into my bag and we'll go together. It won't take me ten
minutes."</p>

<p>Chris sank more deeply into the armchair. A look of utter
weariness stole over him. "Oh, all right--what's the odds?" His
eyes followed Vance listlessly till the lids closed and he leaned
back in a sort of doze. Vance, moving about noiselessly,
collected his belongings and jammed them into his suit-case. He
was consumed with the longing to get away--as much on his own
account as on Chris's. The glare of the sun, the sparkle of
flowers and foliage outside his window, the strains of Puccini
coming up from the Casino Gardens, all the expensiveness and
artificiality of the place, made him think longingly of Oubli, of
the fishermen mending their nets on the beach, the shabby houses,
the peasants ploughing and pruning. "Real people in a real
place," he mused; and his heart warmed as he thought of Halo
waiting at the station at Toulon, and their all jogging home in
the old omnibus over the rough dusty roads...</p>

<p>As the porter came in to take the things down Chris roused
himself. "Look here, Weston--I know what a worm I am. But I'm
afraid there's something owing at my hotel. If you'd lend me
enough to go on with, and I could stay another day, I might come
out ahead after all."</p>

<p>"Come along. I'll settle with the hotel," Vance retorted,
nervously wondering if his own funds would hold out. He slipped
his arm through Chris's, and the latter let himself be led to the
lift, and out of the hotel. As they emerged into the street a
hotel porter came up to Vance with a letter. "Mr. Weston?"</p>

<p>Vance recognized the untidy scrawl in which Floss Delaney had
written her message on the back of the Duke of Spartivento's
card. "Wait a minute," he said unsteadily. He turned back into
the hotel and opened the envelope. There was nothing inside but a
bruised discoloured gardenia. He stared at the livid flower; then
he pushed it into his pocket, and went out to rejoin Chris. It
meant goodbye, no doubt...</p>

<p>He paid Chris's bill, which was more moderate than he had
expected, helped the youth with his packing, and led him firmly
to a waiting taxi. "The station!" he ordered.</p>

<p>Chris sat passive. Vance tried to think of something to say,
but his own brain was in a whirl...That flower--why the devil
had she sent it? It must mean something, convey some kind of
message. She was always lazy about writing; hardly capable of
turning more than a bald phrase or two...shaky about her
spelling too, probably. But, after all, why should she have
written? She had made an engagement--a positive engagement--with
him for that afternoon: it had been made at her own suggestion,
she had sealed it with a kiss. What perversity of self-torture
made him suppose that she would forget it? She had even
remembered his asking her for the flower she was wearing--and
here it was, to remind him of her promise. The flower didn't mean
"goodbye"--if it meant anything it meant "remember"...</p>

<p>But how could he keep the engagement? And did he even want to
now? The vision of Halo at the Toulon station had quickened other
impulses--at least until the faded gardenia stifled them.
Something within him whispered, half hypocritically, half
cynically: "I must see this thing through first."</p>

<p>At the station Chris again hung back. "Look here, Weston...
just till tomorrow..."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow and tomorrow! Come, get out, old man..." In
dragging Chris along the platform he seemed to be dragging
himself too. The train rolled into the station. They followed the
porter.</p>

<p>The train was crowded. Vance pushed Chris and his bag into a
compartment; but there was no other vacant seat. "Never
mind--I'll run along and jump in wherever I can." But as he spoke
he felt another resolution forming in him. "If I can't find a
place," he called out, his hand on Chris's door, "I'll take a
later train. Let Halo know, will you? I'll taxi over from
Toulon." He waved his hand and feigned a dash down the platform.
But the train was moving; he was left behind. After all, he had
done his duty in shipping Chris off.</p>

<p>He left his suit-case at the station and went back to the
hotel where Floss had been staying with her father. From her
having sent him the gardenia he inferred that her visit to Mrs.
Glaisher was over and that she had returned to Monte Carlo and
was awaiting an answer to her message.</p>

<p>The concierge told him she was expected back, but had not yet
arrived. Vance's spirits rose. He wrote her name on an envelope,
scribbled on a sheet of paper: "Where--and when?" and added the
address of his own hotel. Then he went back there to lunch. But
he was too much excited to eat, and leaving the restaurant he
paced up and down the narrow lounge, smoking and watching the
door. An answer was sure to come soon; she had not sent that
flower for nothing...</p>

<p>The minutes and the half-hours passed. It was three o'clock
now; then in a flash it was half-past. The hours of his precious
afternoon were being blown by him like the petals of a flower
dropping before it can be gathered. Unable to endure the suspense
he hurried out and walked back to Floss's hotel. He saw her motor
at the door. The interior was piled up with bags, and at first he
thought she must have just arrived from Cannes; then he saw a man
in shirt-sleeves lifting a motor-trunk into the trunk-carrier. He
went up to the chauffeur. "Is Miss Delaney here?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur said he supposed so. She hadn't come down yet;
but they were starting in a minute for the harbour.</p>

<p>"The harbour?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; for the yacht. I believe Miss Delaney's going on a
cruise."</p>

<p>Vance did not wait to hear the end. He pushed past the
porters, and as he re-entered the hotel the door of the lift
opened and Floss stepped out. She carried a little bag of scarlet
morocco with polished steel mountings and had a fur-collared coat
hung over her arm. Behind her was a young woman carrying more
wraps. Vance went toward the lift and Floss stopped and looked at
him with lifted brows and a faint smile. "Why, Van--"</p>

<p>"Am I late?" he began quickly.</p>

<p>She continued to gaze at him, not embarrassed but merely in
gentle surprise. "Late--for what?"</p>

<p>"For our engagement. I came before, but you weren't here. Are
you coming with me now?"</p>

<p>Her lovely eyebrows still questioned him. "But, Van, I
don't--"</p>

<p>He broke in with a bitter laugh. "Are you trying to tell me
you've forgotten?"</p>

<p>"What I <i>had</i> forgotten was that this is the day I start
for a cruise with the Blemers. I can never remember the day of
the week. We're going to Sicily," she explained gently.</p>

<p>"No!" he burst out.</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>?"</p>

<p>"I say no. Last night you swore to me--"</p>

<p>She turned and threw her cloak over the maid's arm. "Put that
into the car. And my bag." The girl disappeared, and Floss laid
her hand on Vance's arm. "Come." He followed her into the empty
writing-room behind the lounge. Between two of the little
mahogany writing-desks with green-shaded lamps she paused and
stood smiling up at him. "Darling--it's such a stupid
mistake."</p>

<p>"What's a mistake?"</p>

<p>"About the date. I'm sorry. I thought the Blemers weren't
starting till tomorrow. Honestly I did."</p>

<p>"Well--can't you follow them tomorrow, if you're so bent on
going with them? You owe me this one day."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Charter a yacht and give chase? That's an idea!
But I'm afraid I couldn't find anything fast enough to catch up
with them."</p>

<p>"Why need you go with them at all? You swore to me--"</p>

<p>Her lids drooped, and her lips also, dangerously. "Yes; I
know. But please don't be a bore, Vance."</p>

<p>"A bore--?" He felt his heart stand still. Her face was as
smooth as marble. "Why did you send me that flower, then?"</p>

<p>"That flower? Why--for goodbye..." She held out her hand
with a smile. "Not for long, though...You'll be in London next
summer? Father and I are going there in June.--Yes;
<i>coming!"</i> she called out in a gay voice, signalling to some
one in the door behind him.</p>

<p>Fierce impulses raged in him; he wanted to pinion her by the
arms, to hold her fast. He caught at her wrist; but she laughed
and shook herself free. "So long, dear.--Com<i>ing</i>!" she
cried in the same gay voice as she swept past him into the
hall.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XXV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It had been raining steadily for the three days since Vance's
return to Oubli. A soft regular rain; it came down on the roof of
the Anglican chapel with a rapping like the rattle of palm-fronds
in an African oasis. Why had that occurred to him? He had never
been to Africa, never seen an oasis; but he had heard some one
say: "In the dry season the rattle of palms in the wind sounds
just like rain. God, it gets up a fellow's thirst!" Like drift on
a swollen river, all sorts of unrelated thoughts and images
jostled each other in his brain. He could not clear his mind of
them, or fix it, for more than a moment or two, on the sombre
words that Mr. Dorman, distant and surpliced, was speaking from
the chancel.</p>

<p>"Thou makest his beauty to consume away, like as it were a
moth fretting a garment...</p>

<p>"As soon as Thou scatterest them they are even as sheep...
For when Thou art angry all our days are gone...O spare me a
little that I may recover my strength, before I go hence and be
no more seen..."</p>

<p>Ah, cruel implacable God of Israel, Who, among all the
generations of men, sufferest so few to recover their strength
before they go! What mockery to apply to this poor broken boy the
stupendous words that shake the bones of the saints!</p>

<p>There he lay, under the pall and the wreaths, "turned to
destruction", as Mr. Dorman told them--voluntarily turned to it,
as Vance secretly believed. The shabby wreath of anemones and
stocks was, of course, Miss Plummet's. Lady Dayes-Dawes had sent
arums. There was a hideous cushion of white immortelles with
"Chris" on it in yellow--how he would have laughed at it! Halo
had managed to find violets, heaps and heaps of them, though they
were nearly over--with a spray of cherry-blossom, the first of
the year. Ah, implacable God of Israel! But now--listen:</p>

<p>"It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption; it is
sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory..." What martial music
the Prayer-book made out of the old cry of human mourning! This
sorrow sown in dishonour, was it indeed to be raised in glory? A
sob from one of the black-muffled figures in front seemed to ask
the same question. Then silence again; the rattle of rain; and
"Lead, Kindly Light" from the volunteer choir, with Miss Plummet,
in tears, at the harmonium.</p>

<p>When they came out the rain had stopped. The coffin was lifted
into the old weak-springed hearse, with its moth-eaten tufts of
black feathers all bent one way. (How he would have laughed at
the feathers too!) The procession straggled off. Oubli could not
provide enough mourning coaches, and its two wheezy Fords closed
the line, noisily resisting their drivers' attempts to keep them
in step with the heavy black horses. In the English corner of the
hard bare cemetery cypresses and laurestinus had been planted,
green things trained over the graves. But to get there the
mourners had to walk two by two (Mrs. Churley's weak swollen feet
setting the uncertain pace) through arid rows of French graves
with wreaths of wire and painted tin-foil, and china saints under
glass bells. Vance remembered Chris's saying that French funeral
wreaths always reminded him of the once-for-all thoughts that the
living think of the dead: rigid indestructible opinions that
there is never any need to renew.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God to take out of this
world the soul of our deceased brother--" Mr. Dorman was saying
across the yawning grave.</p>

<p>"Out of the world"; with all its laughing and crying and vain
tumult..."The wind on the heath, brother--" How Chris had
shrugged away Vance's facile admonitions! Wind on the heath, wind
in the palms, all the multiple murmurs of life--Chris Churley's
ears were forever closed to them.</p>

<p>Yes; he had been Vance's brother; and how had Vance dealt with
him? "What hast thou done with this thy brother?" Why, deserted
him at the last moment, shoved him into the train and left him
alone with his self-derision, his bitter consciousness of
futility and failure. Vance knew well enough what it felt like to
be alone in such a mood, without friends, without hope, without
future; he had been through it all in the early days in New York.
Yet he had not given it a thought when he shoved Chris into the
train and dashed away on his own crazy errand. What had he done
with his brother?</p>

<p>"Ashes to ashes--dust to dust--" As Chris was today, so would
he be in his turn, nailed up with his withered dreams...</p>

<p>The earth fell on the coffin; somebody piled the wreaths on
the mound. The sun came out, as if curious to see what this
little group of bowed-down people were about; and in the dazzle
of the indifferent day they crawled back to the carriages.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the taxi Halo burst into tears. Vance put his arm about
her. She seldom wept, and her grief moved him, and made him feel
ashamed of his own dry eyes. But though his soul was heavy he
could get no relief. Halo wiped away her tears and looked up at
him. "You still think it wasn't an accident?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it wasn't."</p>

<p>"But they said he didn't see the other train coming when he
got out. The people in the other train said so."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All the same, you think--?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what does it matter?" Vance groaned.</p>

<p>"I'm glad Mr. Dorman was convinced it was an accident.
Otherwise there couldn't have been a proper funeral..."</p>

<p>"I know..."</p>

<p>"It would have killed Mrs. Churley if he'd refused."</p>

<p>"Sorrow don't kill people. It seems to give them a sort of
kick. Look how she walked all the way to the grave and back."</p>

<p>Silence again; she pressed his hand tight. "Promise me,
dearest, you won't go on thinking yourself to blame."</p>

<p>Vance laughed drearily. "People have got to think what they
can. I ought to have come back with him..."</p>

<p>"What folly! You put him in the train."</p>

<p>"I ought to have come back," Vance repeated, as if to himself.
The taxi stopped before the pink house and they got out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At first Mrs. Churley had refused to see Vance; but two or
three days after the funeral she deputed Mrs. Dorman to ask him
to come up to the villa. Halo wanted to go instead; she seemed to
dread the meeting between Vance and the Churleys. Vance, she
argued, was still suffering from the shock of the dreadful news;
he had told her what little there was to tell. Why not let Mrs.
Dorman explain this to the Churleys, and suggest that Halo should
go to them instead?</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorman pursed up her lips, and her cheeks reddened, as
they did when she saw a chance of imparting unpleasant news. "It
was Mr. Weston that Mrs. Churley asked for."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll go," Vance roused himself to answer.</p>

<p>When he came back from the Churleys' he went upstairs to the
study and threw himself down on the old divan where Chris had so
often sprawled during the long evenings full of laughter and
discussion. Vance, on his way back from Monte Carlo, had thought
longingly of that room; his old life seemed to hold out healing
arms to him. Then, on his threshold, he had heard the stupefying
news of Chris Churley's death--the accident which had flung him
under the wheels of an incoming express as he was getting out of
his own train at Toulon; and from that moment Oubli and
everything about it had become as hateful to Vance as the scenes
from which he had just fled.</p>

<p>He lay with his eyes shut, reliving the hours since his
return, and feeling as if he too had been flung out of the
security and peace of his life and crushed under the sudden
wheels of disaster. In the next room Halo was moving about. She
would not come in and torment him with questions, as another
woman might; she would merely let him know by an occasional sound
or movement--the pushing back of a chair, the click of the
Remington--that she wanted him to be aware of her nearness, and
of the silent participation it implied.</p>

<p>The Remington...If only he could have got back to work! In
the first horror of seeing Floss Delaney down by the river with
his grandfather his anguish, he remembered, had crystallized
itself in words; the shock had forced his first story out of him.
And all through the dark weeks before Laura Lou's death he had
known the same mysterious heightening of creative power: as if
his talent were an ogre, and lived on human suffering. But now he
felt only an inner deadness; he seemed faced by a blank wall
against which he might dash his brains out. Everything was stale
and withered, without and within; he could almost taste the
corruption--the same, no doubt, that Chris had tasted...</p>

<p>He got up and wandered into Halo's room. She turned as he
entered, feigning surprise. "Back already?--Well?"</p>

<p>Vance stood beside her, drumming on the lid of the typewriter.
"She knows--"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Churley? Knows what?"</p>

<p>"That it wasn't an accident."</p>

<p>"Vance! Did she tell you--?"</p>

<p>"No. He was there. But she didn't have to--"</p>

<p>Halo put out her hand and imprisoned his restless fingers.
"Dear, aren't you just imagining--?"</p>

<p>"God! I don't have to imagine--"</p>

<p>"Tell me just what she said."</p>

<p>"She said she couldn't bear to have me there. It didn't last
five minutes."</p>

<p>"Poor, poor woman!"</p>

<p>"I could see she hated the very sight of me. She thinks I
killed him."</p>

<p>"But what folly--when it was you who gave him his best
chance!"</p>

<p>"Did I? Perhaps they're right and we were wrong. Anyhow I
ought to have come back with him."</p>

<p>"But surely you told them you couldn't find a place in the
train?"</p>

<p>"Yes--I told them."</p>

<p>"Well, dear?" She lifted her grave eyes to his, and he
thought: "If I told her the truth, would it make any difference?"
For he knew well enough that what he was suffering from was not
so much the shock of poor Chris's suicide as the dark turmoil in
his own heart. It was his vanity that was aching, and his pride;
in a sudden craving for self-abasement he longed to cry out his
miserable secret.</p>

<p>"I wish you could get back to work," Halo said.</p>

<p>He made a derisive gesture. "Get back to work--that was what I
used to tell Chris. I see now there wasn't much point in it." He
turned away and threw himself again on the divan. What was the
use of making some one else unhappy? His misery was his own; he
had no right to ask any one to share it--least of all this woman
who loved him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The days dragged by. Vance, in spite of his curt retort to
Halo, did try to take up his writing; but he could not. His
imagination was dormant, his fingers seemed almost literally
benumbed. The weather remained unsettled; day after day raw gales
swept the sullen skies and rain burst from them with fitful
violence. Every spring, the peasants told him, it stormed at
Oubli in cherry-blossom time; and if the rain persisted it
destroyed the fruit crop, and if it ceased the drought spoilt the
early peas.</p>

<p>Vance resumed his long daily tramps. Halo had caught cold at
the funeral, and in spite of her disregard for wind and weather
he would not let her go with him. In truth he was glad to be
alone. Some spring in him was broken; he felt like a man driving
a motor with a disabled steering-gear. When he was with Halo he
lived in dread of not being able to keep himself from some
foolish burst of self-betrayal. When she said: "You mustn't let
Chris's death make you so unhappy," he had to fight his impulse
to burst out: "It's not Chris who's torturing me." He hardly knew
the exact source of his pain. Since he had returned to Oubli, and
slipped back into the old familiar life with Halo, everything
about the interlude of Cannes and Monte Carlo had become as
unreal as the scenery of a stage-setting. He seemed to have been
moving in a world of flippant spectres; only Floss Delaney kept
her mordant reality. And the strange thing was that, from the
very moment of their meeting, she had produced no illusions in
him, excited no surprise. She had appeared, in that opulent
environment, neither rarer nor lovelier than when, as a raw boy,
he had worshipped and loathed her in the maple-grove at Crampton.
It was true that she had not changed; perhaps, as she had said,
no one <i>does</i> change; and for that very reason the common
unimaginative girl who had captivated the untried boy exercised
the same spell over the young man from whom a world of experience
divided her. That was the dangerpoint. No alteration of setting
or of ideas--not even the profound shock of Chris Churley's
suicide--could shake him out of his unwilling subjection. It was
because he saw her as she was, and was still drawn to her, that
his plight was hopeless. Whenever he shut his eyes there was her
bare arm, like amber in the moonlight; the touch of it burned in
him. It was useless to tell himself that now that he knew the
world he could place her without difficulty, could class her as
the trivial beauty whom any intelligent man would weary of in a
week. Intelligence had nothing to do with it. You might as well
say that an intelligent man would weary in a week of the scent of
a certain flower, when there are flower-scents that all through
life work the same magic. Vance knew there were selves under
selves in him, and that one of the undermost belonged to Floss
Delaney.</p>

<p>Again and again he was tempted to confess himself to Halo; to
do so might break the spell and tranquillize him. And perhaps it
would not be so difficult. When his story, "One Day", had been
discovered and published by Lewis Tarrant, and Vance, in an hour
of expansion, had told Halo that he had written it to rid himself
of his first sorrow, he had described Floss to her, and she had
shuddered and sympathized. He would only have to say: "You
remember that girl at Euphoria that I told you about?" to have
her sympathy spring up. Ah--but would it? That other tale, when
he had told it, already belonged to a distant past; neither he
nor Halo could have dreamed that Floss Delaney would ever
reappear in their lives. Now it was different. Intelligent though
Halo was, could he hope to make her understand that a man may
love one woman with all his soul while he is perishing for the
nearness of another? Some day he might put that story in a novel;
fitfully, even now, the idea came to him, he felt its richness
and complexity--but only for a moment. The next he was back in
the dark coil of his misery; and he knew that the impulse to
confess himself was due not to any belief that confession would
break the spell, but only to his monstrous craving to talk of
Floss to any one, to every one, even to the woman he might wound
to the heart in naming her. He thought: "I've hurt her so often
without meaning to. At least I can keep myself from doing it with
my eyes open."</p>

<p>Since Vance's visit no sign had come from the Churleys. He
suspected that Halo resented their silence, resented the poor
mother's harsh dismissal of Vance after she had sent for him. It
was cruel, certainly, for they knew that Vance had tried to
befriend Chris, that Vance's comradeship had been the one
brightness in the boy's last months. But perhaps that was what
they resented, though Halo refused to admit it. "They can't be so
wickedly unjust--." But that was precisely what great sorrow made
of people--didn't Vance know? Perhaps it even comforted them, the
poor creatures, to have some one against whom they could cherish
a bitter resentment. Well, let them--!</p>

<p>One day, coming in from a solitary ramble, he found a letter
awaiting him. He broke the seal and read: "Dear Mr. Weston, I
have only just learned that my son's visit to Monte Carlo was
brought about by your having lent him twenty pounds. Pray excuse
my involuntary delay in sending you the enclosed cheque, which I
beg you to accept with my thanks. Yours very truly, Augustine
Churley."</p>

<p>Vance uttered an angry exclamation. Halo, who was sorting the
papers on his desk, looked up. "Oh, Vance--it's Colonel Churley?"
He tossed the letter over to her.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a loan--and Chris knew it!" Vance fumed. It seemed
as though these people had divined how he hated himself for
having left Chris, and were seizing on every pretext to increase
his misery.</p>

<p>"But how did they know the amount? Chris must have told
them--or have left a letter."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't take it," said Vance nervously. "They'll end by
poisoning my memory of him. I daresay they think my giving him
that money was the cause of his death."</p>

<p>Halo reflected. "No; you can't take it. Give it to me; I'll go
and see Mrs. Churley."</p>

<p>"She won't see you."</p>

<p>"I think she will. Mrs. Dorman will arrange for me to go when
her husband's out. She couldn't talk to you the other day because
he was there. But you'll see--"</p>

<p>Vance drew a breath of relief. He was so used to Halo's
smoothing out the asperities of life that he felt almost as
certain as she did of her ability to cope with Mrs. Churley. And
at least the question of the money would be effaced from his
mind.</p>

<p>The next day he did not get back till late from his walk. As
he mounted the stairs he caught Halo's voice: she was speaking
excitedly, in a tone of irritation unusual to her. The study door
was ajar, and he heard Mrs. Dorman replying, in the conciliatory
voice in which she communicated anything likely to give pain:
"I'm so sorry, Mrs.--Mrs.--. You must really tell me, you know,
what I ought to call you," she interrupted herself with a faint
cough.</p>

<p>Vance strode in. Halo was standing, her head high, her face
pale; Mrs. Dorman confronted her with excited spots of red on her
round innocent-looking cheeks. "You mustn't really take it so
hard," she was protesting.</p>

<p>Halo turned to Vance. Her lips were as pale as her face, and
her arm trembled slightly as she rested it on the desk; but her
voice was quiet. "Mrs. Dorman tells me that Mrs. Churley would
rather not see me."</p>

<p>Vance guessed instantly what had happened. Ireful words sprang
to his lips; but Halo's glance checked him. How right she
was--always! It would have been a pity to gratify Mrs. Dorman by
any sign of discomfiture. "Since Mrs. Churley doesn't want to
receive either of us," he rejoined, in a voice as quiet as
Halo's, "I don't see that there's anything more to be said."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorman looked undefinably disappointed. "But I didn't
mean that, Mrs. Weston. On the contrary. Mrs. Churley's very
sorry she was so overcome when you came the other day; she'd be
glad to see you again. The message I brought was for Mrs...
Mrs..."</p>

<p>"My name's Weston," Vance interrupted.</p>

<p>"Exactly." Mrs. Dorman's face grew rounder and rosier. "And at
first we all supposed...naturally..."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dorman," Halo intervened, "has just told me that Mrs.
Churley's reason for not wishing to see me is that she's heard we
were not married."</p>

<p>"I told her I'd always understood that in the States you
attach comparatively little importance to being married...
that perhaps we oughtn't to judge you by our standards. But
naturally that's not the general feeling in England; at least not
among Church people--and Mrs. Churley was dreadfully upset. You
know she always dreaded any...any demoralizing influence on
that poor boy; and I'm afraid she's taken it into her head that
his friendship with Mrs.--Mrs.--"</p>

<p>The red rushed to Vance's forehead. "This lady's name is Mrs.
Tarrant; but it will be Weston soon. Please say to Mrs.
Churley--"</p>

<p>Halo laid her hand on his arm. "No, dear; there's nothing more
to say. Except that we both loved Chris, and that we feel for his
mother with all our hearts."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorman stared with the bewildered look of one who has
lost her cue. "But you will come to see her, Mr. Weston?"</p>

<p>"There'd be no object in it. Mrs. Tarrant has told you all we
have to say."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorman uttered a baffled sigh. "It's so very sad," she
murmured. She gathered up her boa, and Vance opened the door and
silently saw her down the stairs.</p>

<p>"It all falls on you--always!" he broke out indignantly as he
returned to Halo.</p>

<p>She surprised him by a gesture of appeal. "That poor
mother--oh, Vance, don't be angry with her! If only there was
anything we could do! I feel as if you and I were the real
debtors--everybody's debtors; as if, to be as happy as we are, we
must have stolen too many other people's happiness. Darling, do
you suppose we have?" she burst out, her arms stretched to
him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The days passed heavily. Vance and Halo held no further
communication with the Pension Britannique. Vance returned the
cheque to Colonel Churley, with a note saying that the twenty
pounds had been a gift to Chris, and that Chris was aware of it;
and the following week a copy of Mr. Dorman's parish bulletin was
left at the pink villa, with an underscored paragraph announcing
that Colonel Churley, in memory of his son, had given twenty
pounds to the Church library (Purchasing Committee: the Chaplain,
Lady Dayes-Dawes, Miss Plummet.) Vance was diverted at the
thought of the works which would be acquired with this fund; he
amused himself and Halo by drawing up a probable list, and they
smiled over the brilliant additions that Chris would have made to
it.</p>

<p>But Vance was still full of disquietude. Everything in his
life seemed to have gone wrong, to have come to grief. He asked
Halo, the day after Mrs. Dorman's visit, if she would not like to
leave Oubli; but she said with a smile that she didn't see why
they should alter their plans to suit the Pension Britannique.
They had taken the villa for a year, and she wanted him to have a
taste of the summer life, the boating and bathing, the long hot
days on the sands. "There'll be nobody to be scandalized
then--the Pension Britannique closes in summer. If you suppose I
mind what those poor women say," she added carelessly; and he
understood that nothing could be more distasteful to her than to
seem aware that she was the subject of gossip and criticism.</p>

<p>Vance himself had no feelings of the sort. He resented
furiously any slight to Halo, but saw no reason for appearing to
ignore such slights. He supposed it was what he called the
"Tarrant pride" in her; the attitude of all her clan; the same
which had helped Tarrant to stiffen himself against the moral
torture of his talk with Vance, and affect indifference when
every nerve was writhing. It all seemed an obsolete superstition,
as dead as duelling; yet there were moments when Vance admired
the stoicism. He could think of girls--straight, loyal, decent
girls--who, if they loved a man, and lived with him, would have
gloried in the fact, and laughed at social slights and
strictures. But Halo suffered acutely from every slight and
stricture, yet bore herself with the gayest indifference. "All
those old institutions--I suppose there was something in them, a
sort of scaffolding, an armour," he thought. He felt how often
his own undisciplined impulses needed the support of some
principle that would not have to be thought out each time.</p>

<p>But if Halo did not want to leave Oubli, he did; and she was
not long in divining it. There was no longer any question of his
working; the manuscript lay untouched. If he were ever to finish
"Colossus" he must get away--get away at once. When he had
lectured Chris on the evils of idleness he had little imagined
that within a few weeks he would be exemplifying them. "I told
him he'd be able to work fast enough if he had to--such rot! Look
at me now!" he said bitterly.</p>

<p>"But it's just because of Chris that you can't work. You're
still suffering too much."</p>

<p>"A good many books have been made out of suffering."</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but not out of tattered nerves. You've got to get
away." He was silent. "Why not go to London?" she suggested
suddenly. "It's time you saw your publishers about 'Colossus'. Go
now; it's just what you need. You could stay with Tolby, who's so
often invited you."</p>

<p>Vance felt a rush of life in his veins. London--London! He
remembered the look in Chris Churley's eyes when he had heard the
magic suggestion. "I wonder if my eyes look like that to Halo,"
Vance thought with a twinge of compunction; but the twinge was
fleeting. London, Madrid, Constantinople--it hardly mattered
which. Freedom was what they all meant--change and freedom! And
how good to see old Tolby again, and drop back into the current
of their endless talks. Everything connected with the idea of
departure seemed suddenly easy and inviting.</p>

<p>"You'd really rather stay here?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"I'd rather," she smiled.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the train, on the boat, and now in Tolby's snug smoky
quarters, Vance felt the same glow of liberation. With his first
step on English soil had come the sense of being at home and at
ease. The feeling of sureness and authority underlying the
careless confidence with which life was conducted, soothed his
nerves, and put him quietly yet not unironically in his place--a
strangely small one, he perceived, yet roomy and comfortable as
one of Tolby's armchairs.</p>

<p>Tolby lived off the King's Road, on top of a house divided
into old-fashioned flats. Attached to his studio were two
bedrooms, a kitchenette and a slit of a bathroom, with a geyser
which had to be managed like a neurasthenic woman. "When you get
to know her it'll be all right; she'll get tired of trying on her
tricks. She's always a bit nervous at first," Tolby explained. No
one else in the flat was nervous. From the kitchen, at stated
intervals, a broad calm woman (who removed a black bonnet with
strings when she entered the flat), appeared with crisp bacon,
kippered herring, cold beef and large placid puddings. To Vance
the diet was ambrosial. He delighted also in the tidiness of the
studio, where everything was shabby and paintless, but neat and
orderly, with a handful of spring flowers on the breakfast table,
a pleasant fire in the grate, and a general seemliness that
reminded him of Halo. "You must be glad to get back to this from
Montparnasse," he said with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes; when I've had enough talk."</p>

<p>"Isn't there any talk in London?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but it's not a sport or a career. It's done in
corners--furtively."</p>

<p>"At any rate," Vance thought, "I'm not likely to hear any of
that drivel that poor Chris ran after."</p>

<p>Little by little the social immensities of London began to
dawn on him, its groups within groups, each, in spite of all the
broad-casting and modern fluidity, so walled in by silence and
indifference, and he became more and more sure that there was no
risk of any communication between Tolby's group and Sir Felix
Oster's. Among the young painters and writers who came to the
studio he found himself already known, but not what Floss Delaney
would have called celebrated. These young people had read his
books, and were interested in them but not overwhelmed. The
discovery roused his slumbering energy, and he said to himself in
a burst of creative enthusiasm: "They're dead right about what
I've done so far; but wait till they see 'Colossus'--I'll show
them!"</p>

<p>His first days were spent in wandering about the streets,
alert yet dreaming, letting the panorama of churches, museums,
galleries, stream through his attentive senses. Tolby, himself
hard at work, seldom joined him till the evening, and then they
either supped (since dining, in Tolby's group, was out of
fashion) with other pleasant busy people, chiefly writers or
painters, or went to hear old music or to see new dancing. But by
the end of the first week the desire to write had once more
mastered Vance, and he shut himself up at his desk for long hours
of the day.</p>

<p>On Saturdays he and his host went off on their bicycles to
some quiet leafy place where there was an inn with a garden full
of lilacs and tulips, or else they stayed with friends of Tolby's
in low-studded village cottages transformed into bungalows, with
black cross-beams and windows latticed with roses. But as Vance
grew more absorbed in his work even such outings became
disturbing, and he asked to be left behind when Tolby went away
for the next week-end.</p>

<p>Tolby took this as a matter of course (the blessed way they
had in England of taking things like that!), and the following
Saturday Vance, after his friend's departure, turned with a grin
of joy to his work.</p>

<p>Toward evening the opening of the door broke in on a happy
cadence. The placid woman who purveyed the kippered herrings
pronounced: "Mr. Fane", and Vance's memory added: "Of the
'Amplifier'." It was in fact Derek Fane, the young critic whom
Vance had met at Savignac's the previous autumn, and to whom he
had given a verbal outline of "Colossus". The book had undergone
such changes that Vance was glad to see Fane again, and allowed
the talk to be led to his work with more affability than he
usually showed to interviewers. He knew his publishers were
anxious that the "Amplifier" should make the most of his visit to
London, and a talk with a critic like Derek Fane would be very
different from the "third degree" applied by newspaper reporters.
Fane was one of the quietest men Vance had ever met, even in
England. Everything about him was muffled and pianissimo; he did
his interviewing by listening. Vance could hardly recall his
having put a question; but his silence was not only benevolent
but acute. After Vance's summing-up of the new "Colossus" he
merely said: "It sounds as if you'd pulled it into shape"; but
the remark carried such conviction that a glow of encouragement
rushed through Vance.</p>

<p>The next morning the "Amplifier" had a brilliant survey of
Vance's past work, and a discerning account of his projected
book, inserted into a picturesque impression of the King's Road
studio. Henceforth all literary and fashionable London, if it
cared to know, would be aware of Vance's presence.</p>

<p>The first result was a shower of invitations; one from Lady
Pevensey headed the list. She besought Vance to climb to her
little flat on the roof of a new West End sky-scraper for the
most informal of after-theatre suppers. He would find just the
people he liked, and must of course bring his friend Mr. Tolby,
whose pictures everybody was beginning to talk about. Tolby urged
Vance to accept. "It's one of the penalties of your profession;
you must go and film the animals in their native habitat. I can
sit still and wait till they come to be painted--but it's your
job to snap them at their games."</p>

<p>Vance hardly needed urging. It was not so much the novelty of
the scene that attracted him as its atmosphere. Being in England
felt like coming back to something known in a happier state, and,
as the hymn said, "lost awhile". There was nothing like it in his
conscious experience, yet it seemed nearer to him than his actual
life. He discovered that the sense of security and solidarity
emanating from the group of dowdy exiles at Oubli was the very
air of England. Wherever he went it looked out of calm eyes and
sounded in calm voices. Ah, those calm voices, their rich
organ-tones, their still depths of sound! Vance never tired of
them. Halo's way of speaking, and that of her group, was a thin
reminder of those rich notes; but how staccato and metallic
compared with the brooding English intonations! "It's the way
your voices handle the words," Vance explained, struggling for a
definition. "The way a collector touches gems or ivories, not
fussily or mincingly, but surely and softly. Or the way a girl in
a poultry-yard picks up downy chickens." Tolby laughed and said
he liked the last analogy best.</p>

<p>The next day a voice with a different cadence broke in on his
toil. "I'm Margot Crash," it shrilled, and Vance found himself
confronting a slender young lady with a face adorned by
movie-star teeth and eyelashes. Miss Crash's job, though
brilliant, was probably less lucrative than if she had used her
gifts on the screen: she represented in London the literary page
of the Des Moines "Daily Ubiquity". Vance started up to protest
at the intrusion; but the teeth and eyelashes mollified him, and
in another moment their owner, snugly ensconced in Tolby's
deepest armchair, was confessing that she was a beginner, and
desperately in earnest about her job. "If I can get a good
write-up off of you I'm made forever," she declared; "but I'm so
scared I guess you'll have to do it for me. I'm too crazy about
your novels to know how to talk about them to their author."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Vance, "the ones I've already written are
still measurable by human instruments."</p>

<p>She lifted her long lashes with a vague laugh. "Well, what I
want is to find out all about them--how you write them, I mean,
and how you began writing anyhow. What made you think of it? Did
you take a course?"</p>

<p>"A course--?"</p>

<p>"Why, I mean at college. Or did the idea just come to you? Did
you educate yourself to be a writer? Did you begin by studying
your contemporaries? That's the way they make you do in some
courses."</p>

<p>"No; I believe I began with Mother Goose."</p>

<p>Her lovely stare widened; allusiveness was evidently as
unintelligible to her as irony. "Oh, do you mean you started by
writing children's books?" She drew out a little note-book in
which Vance could almost see her inscribing: "Began by writing
for children." "Like the Pollyannas, for instance?" she helped
him out enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Well--something."</p>

<p>She clapped it down. "But what I want to know is--how did you
learn to write for adults? Did you pick one of your
contemporaries and work out your style on his, or did you take
one of the longer courses--the ones that go way back to the
classics?"</p>

<p>"It depends on what you call the classics."</p>

<p>That puzzled her again, and provoked a lovely frown.
"Well--Galsworthy, I suppose," she triumphed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; not as far back as that." Her face fell, but she
wrote on ardently till he signified to her, as humanely as
possible, that there was really no more to tell, and that he must
get back to his work.</p>

<p>"Oh--your <i>Work!"</i> she breathed, in awed acquiescence;
and then, putting out her hand: "You see, I'm trying to write
novels myself, and it just means everything to me to find out
from somebody up at the top what you have to do to get there. But
I don't believe I'll ever have time to go way back to those old
classics," she sighed.</p>

<p>The next day the London edition of the Des Moines "Daily
Ubiquity" brought out a heavily head-lined article on the
celebrated young American novelist who was visiting London for
the first time, and who had acquired mastery in his art by
writing children's stories and taking a college course in adult
fiction. Well, why not?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>To any one not chained by association to the old low-fronted
London there was magic in looking down from Lady Pevensey's
sky-terrace over the lawns of the Green Park and the distant
architectural masses discerned through shadowy foliage. In the
transparent summer night Vance leaned there, lost in the unreal
beauty, and recalling another night-piece, under a white
moon-washed sky, when the Mediterranean lay at his feet, and
Floss Delaney's bare arm burned into his.</p>

<p>The momentary disappointment over, he had been glad that Floss
was not among Lady Pevensey's guests. At first, among those white
shoulders and small luminous heads, he had imagined he felt her
presence; but he was mistaken. Tonight he was in another of Lady
Pevensey's many sets, and apparently it had not occurred to his
hostess that she might have given him pleasure by inviting Floss.
Did she even remember that the two had met at Cannes? Vance was
beginning to learn that in this rushing oblivious world one must
jump onto the train in motion, and look about at the passengers
afterward. As soon as he entered Lady Pevensey's drawing-room he
found himself surrounded, as in old days at the Tarrants', by
charming people who made much of him. Then he had imagined that
they were throwing open the door of their lives to him; now he
knew they were simply adding a new name to their lists. They
marked him down as the entomologist does a rare butterfly, and he
found the process not unpleasant, for he was experienced enough
to enjoy watching them while they were observing him, and he
liked the atmosphere of soft-voiced cordiality and disarming
simplicity in which the chase went on. He recalled with a smile
the days when he had supposed that people in society wanted to
hear the answer to their questions, or to listen to the end of a
sentence. He had learned that they were really indifferent to
every one and everything outside of their own circle; but he did
not care. They were a part of the new picture he was studying,
and he wanted them to be as characteristic and self-sufficing as
his conception of them, just as they wanted him to be the young
genius with rumpled hair who says unexpected things and forgets
to note down his engagements.</p>

<p>"But of course you know Octavius, don't you, Vance?" It was
Lady Pevensey's voice, rousing him from his nocturnal vision to
introduce a small quiet man with a bulging brow, who looked at
him, through the bow-windows of immense horn-rimmed spectacles,
with the expression of an anxious child.</p>

<p>Vance, lost in the tangle of Christian names which were the
only sign-posts of Lady Pevensey's London, tried to make his
smile speak for him. "By name at least--" Lady Pevensey added,
throwing him a lifebelt as she drifted off to other rescues.</p>

<p>"It's the only way of knowing each other that we have time for
nowadays--knowing each other's Christian names," said the little
man rather sadly, aligning his elbows next to Vance's on the
parapet. "I know you write books, though," he added benevolently.
"Novels, are they--or popular expositions of the Atom? It's no
use telling me, for I shouldn't remember. There's no time for
that either--for remembering what other people write. Much less
for reading their books. And if one does, it isn't always easy to
tell if they're novels or biochemistry. So I stick to my own--my
own writing. I'm buried in that up to the chin; buried alive, I
trust. But even that one can't be sure of. It may be that already
I'm just a rosy corpse preserved in a glacier." He glanced
tentatively at Vance, as if hoping for a protest, but Vance was
silenced by the impossibility of recalling any one named Octavius
who had written a book. He hedged.</p>

<p>"Why should you call your books a glacier?" he said
politely.</p>

<p>The other winced. "Not my <i>books;</i> my Book. One's enough,
in all conscience. Even with the irreproachable life I lead, and
only one slice of grilled meat three times a week--all the rest
vegetarian--one is always at the mercy of accidents, culinary or
other; and I need a clear stretch of twenty years ahead of me."
Again he fixed Vance solemnly. "The day I'm assured of that I'll
sit down and finish my book. Meanwhile I hope we shall meet
again. Tell Imp to bring you to Charlie's--I'm nearly always
there after midnight." He nodded and was lost in the throng.</p>

<p>A young lady with a small enamelled face and restless eyes
came up to Vance. "Was Octavius <i>wonderful?</i> We're longing
to know," she said breathlessly, indicating a group of young men
and damsels in her wake. One of the latter interrupted: "He's
never as good anywhere as he is at Charlie's," but the young lady
said curtly: "Not to <i>you</i> perhaps, darling; but he's sure
to have been wonderful to Mr. Weston--" at which her young
followers looked properly awed.</p>

<p>Vance turned on them with a burst of candour. "How can I tell
if he was wonderful, when I don't know who he is? It all depends
on that, doesn't it?" The others looked their astonishment and
incredulity, and the leading lady exclaimed indignantly: "But
didn't that idiot tell you you were talking to Octavius?"</p>

<p>To confess that this meant nothing to him, Vance perceived,
would lower him irretrievably in the estimation of these ardent
young people; and he was struggling for a subterfuge when the
group was joined by a tall bronzed young man whose face was
disturbingly familiar.</p>

<p>"Remember me, Mr. Weston? Spartivento. Yes: with Rosenzweig
and Blemp. We met, I think, at Mrs. Glaisher's." The Duke turned
his Theocritan eyes on the young lady who had challenged Vance.
"See here, I guess you folks don't know that in the U.S. people
call each other by all the names they've got. I presume Mr.
Weston's heard of Octavius Alistair Brant--isn't it?" He shone
softly on his interlocutor, and then turned back to Vance. "Mrs.
Glaisher is demanding to see you; she asked me to remind you that
she is one of your most admirative readers. She has taken
Lanchester House for the season. You will call up, and give her
the pleasure to dine? So long,--happy to meet you; I am going-gon
with Lady Cynthia," said the Duke with his perfect smile,
eclipsing himself before Vance could detain him.</p>

<p>The encounter woke such echoes that for the moment the
identity of Octavius Alistair Brant became a minor matter, and it
was not till the next day that Vance, reporting on the party to
Tolby, found himself obliged to confess that he still failed to
associate Mr. Brant's name with any achievement known to
fame.</p>

<p>Tolby seemed amused. "Yes. How village-pump we all are, after
all! Brant's a little god; but his reign is circumscribed. It
extends from Bloomsbury to Chelsea. He's writing a big book about
some thing or other--I can't remember what. But everybody agrees
it's going to be cataclysmic--there'll be nothing left standing
but Octavius. You know his Prime Minister, Charlie Tarlton? Oh,
well, he's worth while--they both are. Get Lady Pevensey to take
you to one of Charlie's evenings."</p>

<p>Vance was only half listening. Mrs. Glaisher had a house in
London! She wanted him to call her up! If only he had had the
courage to ask the Duke if Floss Delaney were with her. But he
had not been able to bring himself to put the question. And even
now, as he sat looking at Tolby's telephone, he could not make
the decisive gesture. "If she's here we're sure to meet," he
thought; and he got up and went back to his work. But it was one
thing to seat himself at his desk, and another to battle against
the stream of associations pouring in on him. Write? What did he
care about writing? The sound of any name connected with Floss
Delaney's set all his wires humming. He got up again uneasily and
strolled back into the studio, where Tolby sat at his canvas, in
happy unconsciousness of all else. Vance stood and watched
him.</p>

<p>"How do you manage to shut out life when you want to work?" he
questioned.</p>

<p>Tolby glanced up at him, "Life--work? Where's the antithesis?"
He touched his canvas with the brush. "This <i>is</i> Life; the
rest's simply hygienics," he said carelessly. Vance returned to
his desk and continued to stare at the blank page. What a cursed
tangle of impulses he was! Would he ever achieve the true
artist's faculty of self-isolation? "Not until I learn to care
less about everything," he thought despondently.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The next night, at the Honourable Charles Tarlton's little
dove-gray house in Westminster, where everybody sat on the floor,
and people came and went in a casual yet intimate way, without
giving their large rosy host any particular attention, or
receiving any from him, Vance had to acknowledge how good
Octavius was.</p>

<p>His predominance over the rest of the company made itself felt
in the quietest yet most unmistakeable way. He was the only
person who did not sit on the floor. His legs were too short, he
explained; when he got up it was mortifying to see that people
expected him to go ever so much farther. He was provided with a
horrible sculptured armchair, which had been known to his host's
grandparents as "the Abbotsford", and from this throne Octavius
poured out his wisdom on the disciples at his feet. Vance thought
with a pang of Chris Churley. His talk, as it matured, would
probably have been almost as good. And so, perhaps, would his
unwritten book. The chief difference was that Octavius had known
how to come to an agreement with life; also that he philosophized
on barley-water, and had the minimum of material needs. Thus he
had been able to adjust himself comfortably to failure, and make
himself a warm nest in it, like a mouse in a cupboard.</p>

<p>But it was not as a failure that his disciples thought of him;
nor even, in the first instance, as a brilliant talker. As Tolby
had said, talk was not a career in England, and Octavius Brant
had to be something besides, and preferably an author. The big
book was his pretext and his justification, and the excuse of his
audience for hanging on his words. Nobody seemed quite clear as
to what it was to be, and Vance discovered that while there were
those who resented being asked if it were a novel, others,
perhaps the more sophisticated, retorted to his question: "Why,
yes, a novel, of course! It's the only formula that's still
malleable--" in which he recognized a dictum of Octavius's. In
fact, according to Charlie Tarlton, if the book didn't at first
seem like a novel, that would simply mean that Octavius had
renewed the formula; that in future what <i>he</i> chose to call
a novel would <i>be</i> a novel, whether you liked it or not.
Charlie Tarlton did not speak often; in Octavius's presence he
was just rosily silent, dispensing cocktails and cigarettes; but
when the great man was late in arriving--and his hours were
incalculable--Charlie, to keep the disciples in a good humour,
would sometimes drop an oracle on the subject of his work.</p>

<p>"You've read it, then?" Vance one evening blundered into
asking; and the elect looked grieved, and Mr. Tarlton slightly
irritated. "Read it? Read it? What exactly does reading a book
consist in? Reading the original manuscript--Octavius writes out
every word with his own hand--or the typescript copy, or the
proofs, or the published book? Every one of these versions is a
different thing, has its own impact, produces its specific set of
reactions. But what I've read is better than any of them--the
author's brain. There's where you get the quintessential stuff.
As Octavius says, it's the butterfly before the colours are
brushed off." Mr. Tarlton leaned back satisfied, resting
comfortable elbows on his cushiony knees.</p>

<p>"Well--exactly!" murmured a devout disciple, with a glance of
reproof at Vance.</p>

<p>"Exactly what?" questioned Octavius, entering in his hat and
overcoat, and removing his scarf with a leisurely hand. Charlie's
rosy face became tomato-coloured and he scrambled uneasily to his
feet.</p>

<p>"He was saying that the quintessence of your book is in your
brain," exclaimed another imprudent devotee. Octavius's small
face withered, and he looked more than ever like an anxious
child. His glance swept over Charlie, searing him like flame. "Is
that by way of apology for the book's not being finished?" he
exclaimed, his voice rising to a high falsetto. "If so, I can
only say that I prefer to do my own apologizing--when I find it
necessary."</p>

<p>A pall of silence fell on the fervent group; Charlie
stammered: "I didn't mean anything of the sort," and Vance,
squatting on a cushion at the great man's feet, ventured boldly:
"You know you haven't yet told me exactly what it's about."</p>

<p>Octavius's countenance softened. There was nothing he liked
better than toying with his theme before a newcomer. "Ah, rash
youth," he murmured, dropping into his armchair, and leaning his
little head back among the knobby heraldic ornaments.
"Rash--rash!" His eyes glittered behind their sheltering panes,
and his short-fingered hands caressed each other softly, as if
his hearer's hand lay between them. But suddenly he shook his
head. "No--no; I won't yield to the temptation. The lovely
creature is there, swimming to and fro in the deepest deeps of my
consciousness, shimmering like a chamaeleon, unfolding like a
flower. How can you expect me to drag it up brutally into the
air, to throw it at your feet, limp and discoloured, and say:
'This is my book!' when it wouldn't be, when I should be the
first to disown it? My dear fellow--" he leaned forward, and laid
his little hand on Vance's shoulder. "My dear fellow,
<i>wait</i>. It's worth it."</p>

<p>Vance looked up at him with renewed interest. "In a way," he
thought, "he's right. His book is written and I daresay it's as
good as he thinks. It's the agony of exteriorizing that he dodges
away from. And meanwhile his creation lives on inside of him, and
is nourished by him and grows more and more beautiful." At the
thought he felt the stealing temptation to dream his own books
instead of writing them. What a row of masterpieces they would
be! They die in the process of being written, he mused. And he
thought what his life might have been if he could have drifted
from one fancy to another, letting each scatter its
dolphin-colours unseen as another replaced it. "If I'd called up
Mrs. Glaisher the other day, for instance--" and suddenly he was
seized with a terrible fear. Supposing Floss Delaney had already
left England? Supposing she had been there, within reach of him,
the night he had seen the Duke of Spartivento at Lady Pevensey's,
and had now vanished again, heaven knew whither? But surely if
she had been in London she would have heard of his being there,
would have telephoned him, or written. His world turned ashen at
the thought. What was he doing in this atmosphere of literary
humbug, among the satellites of a poor fatuous dreamer? Life,
real life, was a million miles away from these ephemeral
word-spinners...The scene crumbled as if a sorcerer's wand had
touched it. And then, just as he was getting to his feet, there
was a stir on the landing outside, and the sound of a small high
voice saying ingratiatingly to a parlour-maid who seemed doubtful
of the speaker's credentials: "Mr. Alders--if you'll please
simply say it's <i>Mr. Alders</i>--"</p>

<p>"Oh, Alders," murmured Charlie Tarlton, with an explanatory
hand-wave to his guests. "Who was it he'd promised to bring,
Octavius?" The question was answered by the parlour-maid's
throwing open the door. On the threshold stood Alders, more
dust-coloured and negative than ever, and behind him, like a
beacon in the night, Floss Delaney. She moved forward with her
light unhurried step and looked about her composedly, as if never
doubting that it was she whom Mr. Tarlton's guests had assembled
to behold.</p>

<p>"This is Floss Delaney," some one said, leading her up to
Octavius. For a moment the little man's face took on the drowned
look of the superseded; then pleasure lit it up, and holding out
his hand he murmured: "Flos florum--I don't know how to say it in
this week's American slang."</p>

<p>Miss Delaney scrutinized him with the cautious friendliness of
a visitor at the Zoo caressing an unknown animal. She laid her
hand on his arm, as if he and she were facing an expectant
camera, and looked about at the assembled company. "Isn't he
<i>gor</i>geous?" she said in her deep drawl.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c28">XXVIII</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Lady Guy Plunder said that if you wanted to hear Octavius talk
you went to Charlie's; but if you wanted to talk yourself you
came, sooner or later, to her.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of truth in it. Her little house in
Mayfair--even smaller than Charlie's, and mouse-coloured instead
of dove--was packed to the doorstep for her cocktail suppers.
Lady Guy (one of the rich Blessoms of Birmingham) had started her
married career in a big house with tessellated floors and
caryatid mantelpieces; but when taxes and overproduction had
contracted the Blessom millions she had moved light-heartedly
into the compactest habitation to be found, and Lord Guy had
abandoned lawn-tennis championships for a job in the city.</p>

<p>Lady Guy, Vance had learned, headed one of the numerous groups
within groups that made London such a labyrinthine adventure.
Lady Pevensey commanded the big omnivorous throng of the rich,
the idle and nomadic. Her name was known round the world to the
echoes of palace-hotels, and was a sure key to sensational
first-nights, theatrical or pugilistic. She was the woman who
could always get you a seat for a coronation, a prizefight, a
murder trial or a show proscribed by the censorship; who juggled
with movie-stars, millionaires and musicians, and to whom all
were interchangeable values in the social market. Lady Guy said
that Imp had a social ticker, and could quote prices in
celebrities at any hour. That she could float them and boost them
there was no denying; but could she also manufacture them? No; it
took Charlie and Lady Guy to do that, and at times the rivalry
was hot between them. Lady Guy, a small woman with quick eyes and
a tranquil manner, had, it was true, failed to capture Octavius,
who was admittedly the biggest haul of post-war London. Charlie
said it was because her atmosphere was too restless; she retorted
that she wasn't going to be stagnant to oblige anybody. But the
two remained on fairly good terms, Charlie because he needed Lady
Guy's finds to entertain Octavius, and Lady Guy because she did
not despair of luring Octavius away from him.</p>

<p>It was at Charlie's that she had discovered Vance, and
immediately she had guessed his value. To the people in Imp
Pevensey's set he was merely the clever new American novelist who
had written "The Puritan in Spain", which was modern enough to
make one feel in the movement, yet full of lovely scenery and
rather sticky love-making. But that would not do for Lady Guy.
She found out about "Colossus" from Derek Fane, and instantly,
whenever Vance was mentioned, the Plunder set said: "Oh, 'The
Puritan in Spain'? Y-yes--that belongs to his pretty-pretty
period. But of course you know about 'Colossus'? Hasn't Gwen
Plunder asked you for next Friday? He's promised to read us some
fragments..." and Vance was immediately known as the author of
"Colossus", that unfinished masterpiece of which the elect were
already cognizant, and which was perhaps to surpass Octavius's
gigantic creation, and probably to appear before it.</p>

<p>That this was clever of Gwen even her detractors had to admit.
If she should succeed in deflating Octavius he might have to
become one of her habitu&eacute;s, if only in order to be
reinflated. And meanwhile there was Vance at her disposal, young,
good-looking, fresh, a novelty to the London palate--while
Octavius was already a staple diet. Instantly Vance became the
most sought-after figure in literary and artistic London, and
certain disdainful personages who had affected indifference to
Lady Guy's previous celebrities now overwhelmed her with
attentions and invitations, all of which she smilingly accepted
without committing herself with regard to the Friday reading.</p>

<p>Lady Pevensey used her artists and writers as bait for
millionaires, and her millionaires (and especially their females)
as baits for Bohemia. If a budding society novelist wanted to
know what sort of gowns and jewels were being worn at small
dinners that year, or what young Lord Easterbridge and the Duke
of Branksome really talked about when they were with their own
little crowd, Lady Pevensey instantly arranged a meeting between
best-sellers and best-dressers. For her parties women put on
their emeralds, and the budding novelist had to come in a white
tie. Lady Guy's policy was the reverse. The first inducement she
offered you was that you needn't dress; in fact she besought you
not to. There were few idlers at her parties, and people were
urged to drop in "just as they were". The men could wear city
clothes, or sweaters and plus-fours, the women come straight from
their studios, old-furniture shops, manicuring establishments,
dress-makers' <i>salons</i> or typists' desks. She had thus
captured some of Bloomsbury's wildest birds, and maddened the
wearers of tiaras with the unappeased longing to be invited.</p>

<p>Vance, as he took off his overcoat, and straightened the dark
brown tie which had been carefully chosen to set off his gray
striped flannel, examined his reflection curiously in the glass
at the foot of Lady Guy's stairs. His selves, as he had long
since discovered, were innumerable, and there were times when
each in turn had something interesting to say to him. But at the
moment only two were audible: the ironic spectator who stood
aside and chuckled, and the hero of the evening, whose breast was
bursting with triumph. Lady Guy had run over, carelessly, the
names of some of the people who had asked to be asked; among them
were a few for whose approbation and understanding Vance would
have given every facile success he had ever enjoyed. And they
were awaiting him now, they wanted to hear what he had to tell
them, they believed in him and in his future. The ironic
spectator shrank into the background as the laughing hero,
besieged by smiles and invitations, sprang upstairs to greet his
hostess.</p>

<p>With the unfolding of the manuscript both these light puppets
were brushed aside, and Vance was the instrument to which the
goddess laid her lips. He forgot where he was, who was listening,
what judgment this or that oracle was preparing to pronounce on
him, and remembered only that each syllable he spoke had been fed
with his life, and was a part of him. At first he was aware of
reading too fast, of slurring his words in the way that Halo
reproved; then his voice freed itself and spread wings, and he
seemed to hang above his creation, and to see that it was
good.</p>

<p>For the most part he was listened to in silence, but he
thought he felt a subtle current of understanding flowing between
him and his audience, and now and then it escaped in a murmur of
approbation that was like wind in his sails. Thus urged, he sped
on. The pages seemed to take life, his figures arose and walked,
and he felt that dizzy sense of power which eternally divides the
creator from the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>As he laid his manuscript down Lady Guy's guests gathered
around him. Every one had something to say, and at once he
divined that for all of them the important thing was not what he
had written but the epithets they had found to apply to it. The
disenchantment was immediate. "It's the same everywhere," he
thought, recalling the literary evenings at the Tarrants', where
the flower of New York culture had praised him for the wrong
reasons. He had learned then how short a way into an artist's
motives the discernment of the cleverest ever penetrated. How his
visions had dwindled under their touch--how he had hated them for
admiring him for the wrong reasons, and despised himself for
imagining that their admiration was worth having!</p>

<p>Now it was just the same. These brilliant sophisticated
people, who had seemed so stimulating and discriminating when
they talked of other people's books--how wide of the mark they
went in dealing with his! He felt ashamed of his dissatisfaction,
which resembled a voracious appetite for praise, though it was
only a timid craving for such flashes of insight as Frenside and
Tolby had once and again shed on his work. One or two men--not
more; and not one woman. Not even Halo, he thought ungratefully...</p>

<p>Awkwardly he gathered up his pages. The cessation of the
reading restored him to self-consciousness, and he wished he
could have escaped at once, like an actor slipping behind the
wings. But his audience was clustering about him, showering
compliments, putting foolish questions, increasing his longing to
be back among the inarticulate and the unself-conscious. And
suddenly, as he stood there, accepting invitations and stammering
thanks, the door opened and Floss Delaney came in.</p>

<p>He had met her only once since their chance encounter at
Charlie Tarlton's. She had urged him, then, to come and see her,
and had named the day and hour; but when he presented himself at
the hotel where she and her father were staying he found her
absent-minded and indifferent, distracted by telephone-calls, by
notes to be answered, and dress-makers to be interviewed, and
abandoning him to the society of her father and Alders. He swore
then that it should be the end, and assured himself that he was
thankful to have had his lesson. But when Floss appeared in Lady
Guy's drawing-room he felt a difference in her before which all
his resolutions crumbled; for he knew at once that she had come
for him, and him only.</p>

<p>She glanced about her in the cool critical way which always
made it seem as if any entertainment at which she appeared had
been planned in her honour; and to Lady Guy's expression of
regret that she should have missed the reading, she replied
lightly: "Oh, I'm glad it's over. I never was much on books."</p>

<p>Her hostess gave a slightly acid laugh. "That's why I hadn't
meant to invite you, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know; but it's the reason why I wanted to come. I mean,
your not wanting me," said Miss Delaney, with her grave
explicitness. "I always like to see what's going on. Besides,"
she added, "I've known Vance a good while longer than any of you
people, and it would have been no use pretending to him that I
understood a word of what he was reading." She went toward him,
and held out her hand. "You'll have to make the best of it,
Vanny. I came to see you and not your book."</p>

<p>It was as if the crowded room had been magically emptied, and
she and Vance were alone. He looked at her with enchanted eyes.
Who else in the world would have known exactly what he longed to
have said to him at that particular moment? Ah, this was what
women were for--to feel the way to one's heart just when the
Preacher's vanity weighed on it most heavily!</p>

<p>Lady Guy's guests were pouring down the stairs to the
dining-room; as Floss turned to follow she threw a smile at Vance
and caught his hand. "We'll go down together. I'm ravenous,
aren't you? Get me something to eat as quick as you can,
darling."</p>

<p>Vance had never seen her so radiant, so sure of herself. Her
very quietness testified to her added sense of power. Her dark
hair, parted in a new fashion, clasped her low forehead in dense
folds which a thread of diamonds held in place, and she wore
something light and shining, that seemed an accident of her own
effulgence. In the crowded little dining-room the mere force of
that inner shining--he didn't know how else to describe it--drew
the men from the other women, who were so much quicker and
cleverer, and knew so much what to say. Vance found himself
speedily separated from her by eager competitors; but he had no
feeling of unrest. For this one evening he knew she belonged to
him, she was not going to forget him or desert him.</p>

<p>And when the party broke up he found himself again at her
side, found that, as a matter of course, he had her cloak on his
arm, and was following her out into the thin summer night. He got
into the motor beside her, and the chauffeur looked back for
orders.</p>

<p>"Oh, how hot it was in there! I'm suffocating, aren't you?"
She lowered the front window. "We'll drive straight down to
Brambles," she commanded, and the chauffeur nodded, apparently
unsurprised. They sped away.</p>

<p>"Brambles? Where's that?" Vance asked, not in the least caring
to know, but merely wanting to fit the new name into his
dream.</p>

<p>"It's a little place father's hired for week-ends; somewhere
under Hindhead, I think they call it. You go over the top of
everything. Don't you think it would be lovely to see the sunrise
from the top of a big hill? I believe we can make it; there's not
much traffic at this hour. I'm dead sick of crowds, aren't you?"
Her head sank back against the cushioned seat. "I wasn't going to
have all those people think you and I'd never done anything
together but talk high-brow!" she exclaimed, with her low
unexpected laugh. She turned and kissed him, and then shook him
off to light a cigarette. "Don't bother me--I just want to doze
and dream."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They flew on through empty streets, through lamplit suburbs
and dark bosky lanes. They sped under park walls overhung with
heavy midsummer foliage, past gates with guardian lodges just
glimmering into sight, through villages asleep about their
duck-ponds, their shaded commons and sturdy church-towers. The
road wound and wound, then rose and breasted a wide stretch of
open heath, soaring, soaring. Vance's heart rose with it,
swinging upward to the light. He sat still, clasping her to him.
She had fallen asleep, and her little head lay on his shoulder.
As they reached the summit of the ridge the chauffeur lowered his
speed, but without stopping, and slowly they glided along above
shadowy sweeping distances, vales studded with scattered trees,
villages and towns with a spire or tower starting up into the
light from the gray crouching roofs.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, look!" Vance cried out, as far away to the east the
day woke in fire through trails of Channel mist.</p>

<p>Floss opened her eyes reluctantly. "I'm cold." She shivered
and drew her cloak about her. "We must be nearly there," she said
contentedly, and her head fell back on Vance's shoulder. She had
seen nothing, felt nothing, of the beauty and mystery of the
dawn. There flashed through him the memory of another sunrise,
seen from Thundertop at Halo's side, when he and she were girl
and youth, and their hearts held the same ecstasy. All that was
over--such ecstasies are seldom shared, and he had grown used to
tasting his sunrises and his poetry alone. But he felt the beat
of life in his arms, and told himself that thus only can a man
reach out of his solitude and be warm.</p>

<p>And now they were winding down again into the blue night of
the lanes. The motor turned in at a gate and drew up before a low
house among dewy flowerbeds. There was a scent of old-fashioned
roses; a lily-pool slept under a gray wall. Everything had the
gliding smoothness and unreality of a dream.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there'll be anybody up to let us in? I
telephoned; at least I think I did; but I don't believe they
expected us before daylight. Oh, boy, aren't the roses just too
heavenly? And what's that blue stuff that smells so sweet?"
Floss, suddenly awake, sprang out of the motor and darted across
the wet grass to a long pool edged with lavender. She knelt and
plunged her bare arms among the sleeping water-lilies. "I want to
wash off London, don't you? But I guess a hot bath would do it
better." She jumped up again and caught him by the hand. "Come
along; we'll come out again by and by, and pick millions and
millions of roses..."</p>

<p>A rumpled but respectful housemaid stood at the door. Another
was hurriedly lighting a fire in the chimney of the low-raftered
hall; and Floss stood on the hearth, laughing and drying her wet
arms.</p>

<p>"We didn't expect you, Miss, not till luncheon," the housemaid
said; and Floss retorted gaily: "Oh, you'll have to get used to
that. My watch never keeps the same time as other people's. I
suppose we can have some coffee or something? And then I want to
go to bed and sleep for hours--" She stretched her arms above her
head with a happy yawn.</p>

<p>Coffee and toast, bacon and jam, invited them to a table near
the fire, and they feasted there in the early sunshine streaming
through low windows hung with roses.</p>

<p>Floss, it appeared, had meant to come off alone for two days.
She was exhausted by London hours and the London rush, she wanted
to get away by herself and think; she was like that sometimes,
she explained. And then, seeing Vance again at Lady Guy's, she
had said to herself how much jollier it would be to have him come
with her--"and just for once pretend it's old times. Shall we,
Vanny?" She leaned to him with one of her swift caressing
touches, and he sprang up and bent over her, covering her neck
and shoulders with impatient kisses. But she pushed him back.
"Darling--I'm fagged out and simply dead with sleep. I'm going up
to my room to bathe and go to bed. They'll give you a bed
somewhere; and I daresay they can find some things of father's
for you. Come down at one and we'll have lunch; and then there'll
be the whole heavenly afternoon...the English afternoons are
as long as whole days, aren't they?" She slipped through his
arms, and ran singing up the stairs. The appearance of the
housemaid on the upper landing prevented pursuit, and Vance,
heavy with well-being, eager yet content, stood waiting before
the fire. As she said, the English afternoons were as long as
days--and it was hardly an hour after sunrise. He followed the
housemaid sleepily to the room assigned to him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yes, that afternoon of late July was as long as a whole day;
but to Vance it passed in a flash. She trailed down late for
lunch, in a pale yellow cotton, a sun-hat on her arm, the heels
of her red sandals clicking on the smooth oak stairs. They
lunched in a thatched porch, its oak posts hung with clematis;
and after coffee and cigarettes wandered out to explore the
garden. It was full of bright midsummer flowers against dark
hedges, of clumps and cones of shining holly. From an upper slope
overhung by ancient Scotch firs they caught, between hills, a
glimpse of the wide dappled country stretching southward. Then
they came down again, and strolled along a lane to the village,
with its low houses hunched about a duck-pond, and its
square-towered church of slaty stone. The gardens before the
houses were brimming with flowers, farm-horses waded in the pond,
geese waddled in a regimental line across the common. All else
slept in the peace of afternoon.</p>

<p>They came back and sat on a bench under an old mulberry tree,
the long lily-pool before them. The air was full of the noise of
midsummer insects. "Summer afternoon--summer afternoon," Vance
murmured, the words humming in his ears like insect-music.</p>

<p>"Darling, you mustn't--they can see us perfectly from the
windows," Floss exclaimed, slipping from his embrace.</p>

<p>"Let's go where they can't, then," he muttered, trying to draw
her to her feet.</p>

<p>"No; not yet. It's so lovely here. Tonight--" she laid her
hand on his arm. "By and by we'll go in and have tea in the
porch. They have such lovely things for tea in England."</p>

<p>He looked at her without knowing what she said; now she
wavered in the summer light like an apparition, now her nearness
burned into his flesh.</p>

<p>She talked on ramblingly, in her level drawl, always about
herself, telling him of her London experiences, her future plans,
the difficulty she had in managing her father. "He's getting
fidgety--he wants to go home. He says he's fed up with swell
society. I guess he's told you about that old family place down
south he wants to buy back. Sounds nice from here, don't it--an
old family place! You'd think it was Windsor Castle. But I know
what it would mean when he got there. A tumble-down house, and
trotting-horses, and cards and racing, and everybody borrowing
from him and swindling him, and the boys dropping in at all hours
for drinks. And this is no time to sell out stocks, anyway...
I'd have to go back and look after him."</p>

<p>She leaned her head against her crossed arms, and Vance's eyes
followed the smooth amber of the underarms detaching themselves
in an amphora-curve from her light sleeveless dress. "I'd rather
get married at once than do that," she grumbled.</p>

<p>But when he asked her, with a forced laugh, whom she thought
of marrying, she said she hadn't made up her mind yet which of
the royal princes she'd settle on; but she'd be sure to let Vance
know in time for him to choose a handsome wedding-present. "For
you're certain to make a fortune out of your books after your
London success, aren't you, Vanny? How much do you expect to make
out of this new book? Forty thousand? They say Kipling gets
fifty. Who looks after your money for you, darling?"</p>

<p>Tea was brought out to them under the mulberry, and she fell
into ecstasies over the thick yellow cream, the buttered scones,
the pyramid of late raspberries with a purple bloom on them.
"Didn't I tell you it would be wicked to miss anything so
heavenly?" She held one of the raspberries against her neck.
"Wouldn't they make a lovely necklace--like dark coral?" She
laughed at the crimson stain on her skin. But as Vance was
bending over to kiss it away the parlour-maid advanced, a
black-coated figure halting discreetly in her wake.</p>

<p>"The Vicar, please, Miss."</p>

<p>"The Vicar? Mercy, what's a Vicar?" Floss whispered hastily.
"Oh, the minister of that church in the village, I suppose." She
rose with sudden cordiality. "How lovely of you to call! Yes--I'm
Miss Delaney. My father's taken this place for the summer. This
is my cousin, Vance Weston--the famous American novelist. I guess
you know him by name, anyhow. They're wild about his books in
London." As she called Vance her cousin she slid a glance at him
under her lashes.</p>

<p>The Vicar, an elderly man with a long purplish face and shy
eyes, melted under her affability, and sat down on the edge of a
garden chair. He looked timidly at Vance, and then away from him,
as if famous novelists were too far out of his range to be
communicated with. Then he remarked to Miss Delaney that the day
was warm. She replied that he wouldn't think that if he'd been
reared in Euphoria; and as this statement visibly deepened his
perplexity she explained that it was the name of the town where
she and her cousin had been brought up. She liked the English
climate better, she added, because when you did get a hot day it
stood right out from the others, and you felt it must have cost a
lot of money to make.</p>

<p>The conversation rambled on slumberously till the Vicar, with
some circumlocution, put in a modest plea for his parochial
organizations. Would Miss Delaney perhaps take an interest in
them? The tenants of Brambles had usually allowed him to hold the
annual parish festival in the gardens. To Vance's surprise Floss
listened with edifying attention, sitting in one of her quiet
sculptural attitudes while the parochial plans were haltingly and
laboriously set forth. It almost seemed to Vance that she was
prolonging the conversation with the malicious intent of
defrauding him of what was left of the day, and he got up and
walked away, hoping the Vicar might take the hint and follow. But
from the farther end of the orchard the intruder could be seen
settling himself with deliberation before a dish of fresh scones,
and another towering pile of raspberries, and Vance, exasperated,
wandered out of the gate and down the lane.</p>

<p>When he returned the garden was empty, and he went into the
low-ceilinged hall, where the light was beginning to fade, though
the day was still so bright outside. From the armchair in which
she lolled Floss stretched out her hand.</p>

<p>"Darling, why did you run away? Didn't you think the Vicar was
lovely? He told me all about School Treats and Mothers'
Meetings." She drew Vance down and wound her arms around his
neck. "I guess the girls are at supper now, and you can kiss me,"
she whispered, laughing.</p>

<p>He knelt beside her, pressing her fast, and throbbing with her
heart-beats. With other women--even with his poor little
wife--golden strands of emotion had veined the sombre glow; but
to hold Floss Delaney was to plunge into a dark night, a hurrying
river. It was as if her blood and his were the tide sweeping them
away. Everything else was drowned in that wild current.</p>

<p>She freed herself and leaned back. "Why, Vanny, what a baby
you are! It's like old times. Do you remember, down by the river?
Do you like me better than any of those girls you've been going
with up in London?"</p>

<p>"She's mine--I must keep her!" was his only thought. But
suddenly the telephone shrilled through their absorption, and
Floss started to her feet. Vance tightened his hold. "Don't
go...don't go...What does it matter? Let the thing be damned,
can't you?"</p>

<p>She shook him off. "No, don't stop me. I must see what it is."
In an instant everything about her was changed: she looked alert
and hard, her lips narrowed to a thin line. "I'm expecting a
message," she threw back, hurrying across the hall to the passage
where the telephone hung.</p>

<p>Vance sank into the chair she had left; his head felt the
warmth where hers had rested. He smiled at her veering moods. At
that moment nothing that she said or did could break the spell;
and they still had the end of the long afternoon, and then the
night, before them.</p>

<p>Through the door into the passage he caught snatches of
question and ejaculation. "Yes--yes: Floss Delaney. Yes; I'm
listening....Oh...why, yes....She did? She <i>is? ...</i>Oh,
gracious!...You're <i>sure?...</i> Yes...Yes....I hear..." The
door swung shut, and only the
indistinct ups and downs of her voice came to him. He was not
trying to listen; what she was saying did not interest him. His
ears were full of their own music. "In a minute," he thought,
"she'll be back..." His eyes closed on the vision.</p>

<p>"Well!" she exclaimed, suddenly standing before him. "Vance,
are you asleep? Well, what on earth do you think--?" She dropped
down on a stool before the hearth, and burst into a queer
exultant laugh. Her eyes shone in the twilight like jewels.
"Well, I know somebody who's down and out--and serve him right
too!" Her laughter continued, in short irregular bursts, as if it
were an exercise she was not used to. "Spartivento! Our darling
Duke's got left! Why, yes...didn't you know he thought he was
going to marry Mrs. Glaisher? I supposed Alders had told you. I
thought everybody knew. He made a big enough fool of
himself--going round asking everybody about her investments. I
warned him she'd be sure to hear about it, but he only said:
'Well, what if she did?' Those Italians, even if they're the
biggest swells in their own country, don't understand our ideas
of delicacy...Well, and what do you suppose? Alders telephones
that she's announced her engagement to the Grand Duke Basil! I
had a bet with Spartivento--I told him I knew he wouldn't pull it
off. I guess I'm a hundred dollars to the good on this; or would
be, if he had the money to pay me--poor old Spart!"</p>

<p>She threw back her head, and in a leap of firelight Vance saw
the laugh issuing from her throat like stamens from a ruby
flower. He felt revolted and fascinated. She was like some one
starting up out of a lethargy; he had never seen her so vivid, so
passionate. What could this sordid story of Mrs. Glaisher and
Spartivento matter to her? He sprang up and pulled her to her
feet. "What do I care about those rubbishy people? Are you trying
to tell me you're in love with the man yourself, and that you
thought you'd lost him?" he burst out, pressing her wrists
angrily. He knew his anger was ridiculous, yet he could not
master it.</p>

<p>"Vance--let me go, Vance! You hurt--let me go!" She twisted
furiously in his hold. "Me in love with Sparti? Well, you think
of good ones! Much obliged!" He dropped her hands, and instantly
she came up and laid her head on his breast. "You're a nice boy,
you are, when a girl's carried you off with her like this, to
accuse her of being in love with another fellow. Have I acted as
if I was?" She lifted her heavy lids and gave him a long look. He
put his arms about her, trembling with joy. "Then,
darling--come."</p>

<p>"Yes--yes." She leaned on him a moment; then she drew back
softly. "We can't behave exactly as if there was nobody but us in
the house, can we? They'll be bringing in dinner soon, and I want
to go to my room first, and have a rest. I'm beginning to feel
that we started our elopement somewhere about three A.M.--aren't
you?" She rested her warm sleepy gaze on his. "He was cross with
me, was he, because he thought I wanted mother Glaisher's
leavings? Looks that way, don't it? Why, I guess I could have
bought her Grand Duke for myself easily enough if I'd wanted to!
What I <i>do</i> want, the worst way, is a hot bath, and a good
sleep before dinner." She slipped out of his arms, and paused
half way up the stairs to wave back at him. "So long,
darling!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Well--if she chose to play her old game, let her. Vance smiled
with the security of the happy lover. Even her childish
excitement over the Glaisher-Spartivento episode amused him. It
was a mind in which everything was exactly on the same level of
importance. Hadn't he discovered that long ago? One didn't ask
for intelligence or sensibility in women of her sort. He felt
light, detached, pleased with his own objectivity. What danger
was there in wasting a few hours over her when his judgment
remained so unaffected?</p>

<p>He strolled out into the garden. The lengthening shadows
seemed to have brought out new scents in the still air. He looked
back and saw a curtain sway out from an upper window--hers no
doubt. His heart stirred; the warmth of her beauty seemed to
envelop him.</p>

<p>He went out of the gate, and roamed through a network of
hushed lanes. The softness of the air entered into his veins. He
met a farm-wagon driving homeward with its load; the hot flanks
of the big slow-footed horses brushed him as they passed. Farther
on, he heard the soft padding of a flock of sheep, and scrambled
up in the bracken to let them pass. Mounting upward he reached a
stretch of open moor, where the clear daylight hung as if
perpetually suspended, and threw himself down in the rough
heather.</p>

<p>As he lay there his mind wandered back over the day. From that
height it seemed to lie spread out before him, clear yet distant,
as if its incidents had befallen some one else. Queer that the
girl's power over him could co-exist with such lucidity! An hour
or two ago everything had been blurred in his brain; now each
fantastic episode detached itself, standing out in beauty or
absurdity. The absurdity, of course, was provided by Floss's
excitement at the report of Mrs. Glaisher's betrothal.
Humiliating as the admission was, Vance had to own that the news
had instantly put him out of her mind. And why, unless, as he had
jokingly suggested, it gave her the hope of capturing
Spartivento? He had joked at the moment; but as the scene came
back to him he winced. Yet why was he suddenly measuring poor
Floss by standards he had never before thought of applying to
her? He had always known that money, flattery and excitement were
all she cared for; to make her forget them for a moment was
probably the most he could hope. Luckily, he reflected, he was
still clear-sighted enough not to sentimentalize the
situation.</p>

<p>He sprang up with a laugh. "Well, it's up to me now. If I
can't get her away from the other fellow I'm no good!" He began
to scramble down the hillside in the gathering darkness as if he
had been racing his rival back to Floss's feet.</p>

<p>When he got down into the shade of the lanes, he was
bewildered by the sign-posts with names of unknown villages, and
taking a wrong turning, wasted half an hour in getting back to
the point he had missed. Under the thick branches the velvet dusk
was beginning to gather, altering the look of things; but as soon
as he was on the right trail again he began to run, and before
long he saw the first roofs of the village, and beyond them the
trees of Brambles. He pushed open the white gate. The low windows
still stood open; their welcome streamed out across the lawn.
Vance ran toward them like a breathless schoolboy. She might
belong to Spartivento tomorrow, but tonight she was his. He gave
a happy laugh.</p>

<p>At the door he met the parlour-maid who had received them that
morning. With her black dress and afternoon cap she seemed to
have regained her professional superiority, and he fancied she
looked at him coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, sir?" She seemed surprised. "Miss Delaney
thought you'd taken the train back."</p>

<p>Vance returned her look blankly. "The train--?"</p>

<p>"But she said, if not," the parlour-maid continued with
manifest disapproval, "we was to serve dinner for you just as if
she'd been here."</p>

<p>Vance continued to stare at her. At first her words conveyed
no meaning to him; then his heart gave a dizzy drop. "What's the
matter? Isn't she coming down? Is she--I suppose she's too
tired?"</p>

<p>The parlour-maid stared in her turn. She did so with an icy
respectfulness. "Down to dinner, sir? Miss Delaney left for
London an hour ago."</p>

<p>Vance stood motionless. The dizziness seemed to have got into
his throat: it was so dry that he could hardly speak. He
repeated: "London?"</p>

<p>The parlour-maid pursed up her lips and drew aside to let him
enter. "You'll dine here, then, sir?"</p>

<p>"Left--but why did she leave? What's happened?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say, sir. I was to give you this if you came
back." She took a note from the table, and Vance carried it to
the light and tore it open.</p>

<p>"Don't be cross, Vanny. I've had a hurry call back to London
and couldn't wait for you to come in. Didn't we have a lovely
day? The girl will tell you about the trains. Love and goodbye.
Floss.</p>

<p>"<i>P.S.</i> No use trying to see me. I'm not going to be in
town for some days."</p>

<p>He read the note over slowly. Then he crumpled it up and stood
looking straight ahead of him. He thought: "Well, I must go and
pack up my things"; then he remembered that he had come down only
that morning, and had brought nothing with him. That gave him a
fugitive sense of relief.</p>

<p>"Which way is the station?"</p>

<p>The maid explained that it was about a mile beyond the
village, and that you took the first turn to the left. "But
there's no train now till eleven."</p>

<p>He had already turned away and was walking down the drive. He
swung along, the gravel crunching under his feet in the silence.
Now he had passed the pool, then skirted the deep shadows of the
holly-garden; now the gate glimmered white before him. He went
out of it and turned toward the village. It was nearly a mile
away, and the dusky lane that led to it was deserted. A little
owl called wistfully in the twilight. He walked on to the
village, across the common, past the duck-pond and out onto the
road that led to the station. That road too was deserted.</p>

<p>Vance walked along at a good pace until he reached the last
turn before the station; then he sat down under the hedgerow and
began to cry.</p>

<h1><a name="c30">XXX</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo Tarrant was at work in the garden of the pink house. The
seeds she had sown in the spring--phlox, zinnia, larkspur,
poppy--contended in a bonfire of bloom. As she knelt over it,
weeding, snipping and staking, her shoulder-blades ached and the
afternoon sun burnt through her broad hat-brim and lay like
burning lead on the nape of her neck.</p>

<p>She liked the muscular fatigue and the slight dizziness caused
by the sun; liked, at the end of each long silent day, to stagger
back into the empty house so stupefied by heat and labour that
she hardly knew where she was, and sleep came down on her like a
fit of drunkenness. In that way the days and the weeks passed,
and the calendar had almost ceased to exist--except when she
started up at the postman's ring. She supposed she would never be
able to cure herself of that start, or of knowing instinctively
when letters were due, though she was so careful to leave her
wrist-watch in her drawer upstairs.</p>

<p>She had heard from Vance only twice since he had left--a
telegram on arriving ("Everything fine quartered with Tolby"),
and about a week later a short word, in which he apologized for
haste and brevity, explaining that his head was surging with new
ideas, that he had settled down at Tolby's to a long spell of
work, and that she mustn't mind if he didn't write often. She
didn't mind at all--at first. She was too thankful to know that
he had got back into the creative mood; there could be no better
proof that he was rid of morbid memories of Chris Churley. But
gradually, as the days passed, and the silence closed in on her,
she felt herself too cruelly shut out from his adventures and
experiences. Not a word of how the work was going, no
acknowledgement of her letters and telegrams (all so studiously
cheerful and comrade-like), no hint of regret at her not being
with him, no briefest allusion to Oubli--or to herself! He had
shed all that, had entered on another phase. Was it just the
intoxication of the return to creative activity, of contact with
new people, tapping fresh sources of admiration (there were times
when he liked that more than he was willing to acknowledge), or
was it--was it a new woman?</p>

<p>She remembered her agony of jealousy in Paris, when he had
vanished so unaccountably for three or four days, and had then
reappeared with a stack of manuscript. She was not going to let
herself suffer such torture again. It had been unwarranted then,
and would probably prove to be so now. From time to time he
needed a change of place and people to set the creative engine
going: was she still narrow-minded enough to grudge it him?</p>

<p>No; only the days were so long, and in his place she would
have found it so easy to write a short letter now and then...
Well, men were different. She couldn't help jumping each time she
heard the postman's step; but she had forced herself not to count
the days since the one letter had come, and really, thanks to
hard work and stupefying sun, she now no longer remembered
whether it was days or weeks since she had heard from him.</p>

<p>She paused in her work, and looked attentively at one of the
flowers. How exquisitely imagined, how subtly wrought! What
patient and elaborate artifice had gone to the inventing of its
transient loveliness! Not so long ago she had scattered seed in
little boxes, and later, dibble in hand, had moved each tiny
plant to its own place. Other seeds she had sown in the beds, in
even furrows, and watched the plants sprout through the light
soil. Between them now, under their spreading foliage, the brown
leaves of the spring bulbs were decaying and turning into mould.
Season followed season in blossom and decline; the fresh leaf
drooped and fell, the young face of the flower withered and grew
old, the endless function unrolled its cruel symbolism unheeded
by those it might have warned.</p>

<p>"If only it wasn't for the caterpillars!" Halo groaned,
lifting a riddled leaf against the light. She knew well enough
what the caterpillars symbolized too: the mean cares, the gnawing
anxieties, that crawl over the fair face of life. She stood up
and stamped vindictively on a writhing green body. And then there
were the seeds that failed--and the young shoots the slugs
devoured...To the general rhythm of rise and fall the heart
might have adapted itself; but the accidental ravages,
snail-tracks, caterpillar slime, the disenchantment and
failure..."I suppose I've been too long alone," she mused,
suddenly sick of her work and her thoughts.</p>

<p>Her solitude was self-imposed; for though the Pension
Britannique and the little cluster of villas belonging to the
pre-war colony were, as usual, closed for the summer, life was
active on the farther side of the town, where the long sand
beach, once so lonely, had begun to be fringed with tin-roofed
"dancings", cheap restaurants and mushroom bungalows. Halo could
once have found plenty of entertainment among the literary and
artistic Bohemians who were already populating this new
settlement. If Vance had been there it would have amused her to
swim and drink cocktails, to sun-bathe and discuss life and the
arts with these boisterous friendly people who flashed by her in
rattling Citro&euml;ns or strowed the sands with naked
silhouettes. But by herself it was different. Paris had cured her
of artistic Bohemia, and as soon as she was alone she felt how
deeply rooted in her were the old instincts of order and
continuity. In Vance too they existed--had they not first drawn
him to her out of the sordid confusion of his life with Laura
Lou? But he was young (she had long since discarded the epithet
in thinking of herself), he was impressionable and inexperienced,
above all he had the artist's inexhaustible appetite for
"material". What more natural than that he should still crave
what for her had lost its savour? "If you wanted to do the same
thing every day at the same hour for the rest of your life," she
told herself, "you ought to have married a teller in a bank, or a
statistician who had to live within a five minutes' walk of the
British Museum, and not a live-wire novelist." But the argument,
from frequent reiteration, had lost its force. "We are what we
are," she thought, "and that's the end of it. At least I suppose
this time it's the end..."</p>

<p>She heard a step in the path, and her heart gave a jump. It
was not the postman's hour; she needed no watch to tell her that.
But it might be a telegram, or a registered letter--if he had
something extra-important to tell her--or it might even...</p>

<p>She turned quickly, and the garden-scissors dropped from her
hand. It was over two years since she had seen that short thick
figure, always in a dark "business suit" of the same citified
cut, and the blunt Socratic face with its shrewd sceptical eyes
guarded by old-fashioned American <i>pince-nez.</i> Over two
years? A life-time! George Frenside came to her out of a dead
world.</p>

<p>"Frenny--oh, Frenny!" She ran to him with outstretched arms.
The sense of her loneliness rushed over her; the words choked in
her throat. Her work-roughened hands sank into her friend's, and
they stood and looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Well, it looks to me like the same old Halo," said Frenside
with his short laugh; and she slipped her hand through his arm
and drew him up the path to the house.</p>

<p>She was too surprised and excited to ask him whence or how he
had come. It was only afterward that she remembered, vaguely, his
alluding to an unexpected holiday in Europe, and to his having
been unable to notify her in advance because his plans depended
on those of a friend with whom he was making a dash to the
Mediterranean. "So I just jumped over from Marseilles on the
chance of finding you," she remembered his ending. She did not
ask his friend's name; her mind could not fix itself on what he
was telling her. She felt only the comforting warmth of his
nearness, the nearness of an old friend whose memories were so
interwoven with hers that his voice and smile and turns of phrase
started up countless fragments of experience, scenes of her
nursery days, of her girlhood with its fervours and impatiences,
and the cold gray years of marriage. Through all those phases his
shrewd eyes had followed her; he was the one being who had
understood her revolts and her submissions, her vain sacrifices
and her final clutch at happiness. To see him sitting there in
the half-darkened room, his head slanted back against the shabby
armchair, his short legs stretched out before him, his
everlasting cigar between his lips, was to become again the Halo
of Eaglewood and New York, and to measure the distance between
that eager ghost and her new self. "I wonder which is the
ghostliest," she thought, as she bent over to mix a lemon-squash
for her friend.</p>

<p>He was waiting for her to speak, to give an account of
herself; but how could she? She had not put her spiritual house
in order, she hardly knew what she was feeling or whither she was
drifting. Solitude had woven its magic passes about her, pouring
a blessed numbness into her veins. And now, at this sudden
contact with the past, every nerve awoke.</p>

<p>"So you've liked it pretty well down here?" Frenside asked,
looking up at her as he took the glass.</p>

<p>She rallied her scattered wits. "Oh, immensely. You see, I was
here in old times with father and mother, and always wanted to
come back. And we had the luck to find this darling little
house--don't you think it's a darling? Did you notice the big
mulberry at the door, and the flagging around it? That was the
old threshing-floor. They used to make oil here too. Wouldn't you
like to come down and see the old oil-press in the cellar?" She
chattered on, smothering him in trivialities, yet knowing all the
while that he would presently emerge from them as alert as ever,
and as determined to have her tell him whatever he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"Thanks. But I'm too well off here. I don't think I'll go down
and see the oil-press. I really came to see you."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>me?"</i> She laughed. "There's not much novelty about
me."</p>

<p>"I didn't come to see a new Halo. I came to find out if the
old one survived."</p>

<p>"Survived what?" she said captiously.</p>

<p>"Why, the storm and stress."</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh. "Dear Frenny, you're incorrigibly
romantic! Being happy is much simpler than people think."</p>

<p>"Well, most of us have to take it on hearsay, so it's
excusable if we're misinformed. You might give a poor devil some
lights on the subject."</p>

<p>She laughed again, but found no answer. Under the banter she
felt his thoughts searching hers, and she was frightened, and for
the first time in her life wanted to shut him out, and could not.
To break the silence she said: "But at least you'll stay till
tomorrow, won't you? I can make you very comfortable in Vance's
room."</p>

<p>"I wish I could, my dear; but I've got to get back to
Marseilles. We're off tomorrow."</p>

<p>There was another silence. Then he went on: "You said:
'Vance's room'. He's away, then?"</p>

<p>Suddenly she became fluent. "Oh, yes; I forgot to tell you;
he's in London. I packed him off to see his publishers and talk
to people about his new book. He's got a big thing under way;
you'll like it better than 'The Puritan in Spain'. I know without
asking that you didn't care much about that. It had a good deal
of success...but that's no reason...This new book is going
to be--well, rather immense in its way: a sort of primitive
torso. A fragment of experience dug up out of the sub-conscious..."
She felt that she was talking into the void, and stopped.
"But it's no use telling you, when you have to take it all on
faith."</p>

<p>"But you believe in it yourself?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do!" she cried with angry fervour.</p>

<p>Frenside seemed not to notice the energy of her reply. The
worst thing about talking with him was that he never did notice
the screens you hung up in front of things.</p>

<p>"Has he been away long?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; only a few weeks. I can't remember just how long...
It's too hot here to remember dates...He'll be so sorry when
he hears he's missed you."</p>

<p>"And you haven't felt lonely down here all by yourself?"</p>

<p>She paused a moment; then she said quietly: "I stopped being
lonely two years ago."</p>

<p>"I see." It was the first time he had taken any notice of her
answers. For a while he was silent, busy with the relighting of
his cigar. After a while he said: "Why didn't you go to London
with him? You could have helped him to find his way about."</p>

<p>"He doesn't need to have any one find his way about for him.
And I hate that sort of life."</p>

<p>"Seeing intelligent people, and breathing in ideas? You didn't
use to." He threw his cigar impatiently onto the hearth. He was
visibly embarrassed and irresolute. "Look here, child; you and I
used to say things straight out, no matter how unpalatable they
were, and this fencing's a waste of time. I wish to God you and
Weston were married; that's what I came to tell you."</p>

<p>The blood rushed to her forehead; she hoped that in the shaded
light he would not notice it. "It's so dear of you, Frenny. But
you know as well as anybody why we're not."</p>

<p>"I know Tarrant has blundered. Weston went to see him; and I'm
afraid that didn't help."</p>

<p>She lifted her head quickly. "It ought to have!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, in an ideal world. It was a fine gesture. But you
must take into account men's passions and weaknesses."</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment; then she said wearily: "If you
knew how little it all seems to matter now."</p>

<p>"It ought to matter, child. At least if I understand the case.
You ought to be Weston's wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, Frenny, don't go on!" She started to her feet, the need
of avowal overmastering her. The frozen depths were broken up;
she must lay her troubled heart in a friend's hands. "You
see--it's not as simple as I said. Being happy, I mean. That was
bluff." She gave a faint laugh. "I used to think marrying him
would be the solution. I used to think: if only Lewis would set
me free! But now I don't know--I don't seem to care. I suppose
it's too late; or perhaps it never would have made any
difference. Perhaps I wasn't meant for storm and stress, though I
was so sure they were my element!" She sat down on the arm of his
chair and hid her face, while her old friend's arm embraced
her.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the only thing that's too late in this
business," Frenside began abruptly. "It's your marriage. We most
of us need a frame-work, a support--the maddest lovers do.
Marriage may be too tight a fit--may dislocate and deform. But it
shapes life too; prevents growing lopsided, or drifting. I know
you've both felt that, I know it's not your fault if you're still
at loose ends. I've done my best--"</p>

<p>She bent down and pressed her lips on his frowning forehead.
"Frenny, my darling friend--don't go on."</p>

<p>"How can I help it? I know it hurts; but let's have the
bandage off--do!"</p>

<p>She sprang up. "If you mean talking of ways and means,
planning to coax Lewis--I forbid you! I forbid you to say a word
to any one!"</p>

<p>Frenside took off his glasses, rubbed them, put them on again,
and examined her anxiously. "Take care, Halo! Don't defy
opportunity. She's a resentful jade."</p>

<p>"What opportunity?"</p>

<p>"The fact of Tarrant's realizing he's been in the wrong, and
wanting to make amends--as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Halo gave a short laugh. This was so like life that she
somehow felt she had always been expecting it. "I suppose you're
his ambassador?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose so--with the proviso of being disavowed if I
don't succeed."</p>

<p>She threw back her head and closed her eyes as the
possibilities he suggested went rushing through her.</p>

<p>Then she looked at him through eyes screwed up with amusement.
"How you must have hated the job!"</p>

<p>"Not for you."</p>

<p>"Good old Frenny! Isn't it enough that I'm endlessly
grateful?"</p>

<p>"No, it's not."</p>

<p>"Well, then--" She paused. "Fren, you remember that old story
we used to like, of Firdusi and the gifts from the Sultan? They
were magnificent when they finally came; but he was dead."</p>

<p>Frenside nodded. He took off his glasses, and wiped them
again. "Yes; but it's not really a good allegory, because we
never <i>do</i> know when we're dead. I thought I was, years ago;
and here I am aching all over again with your aches."</p>

<p>"Oh, my aches are not bad enough for that. Only, it's no use
your pleading my cause with Lewis now."</p>

<p>"I'm not here for that. I'm here to plead Tarrant's cause with
you. He regrets his attitude; he's honestly sorry to have created
such a situation for you. That's what I'm here to say."</p>

<p>She threw herself down on the divan, and sat for a while with
her face hidden. She no longer wanted to conceal anything from
Frenside, but she did not quite know how to put her feeling into
words. "Even if he were to give me my freedom tomorrow I
shouldn't tell Vance," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Not tell him--for God's sake, why?"</p>

<p>"Because the only thing I care for is <i>his</i> freedom. I
want him to feel as free as air."</p>

<p>"H'm--free as air. The untrammelled artist. Well, I don't
believe it's the ideal state for the artist, any more than it is
for the retail grocer. We all of us seem to need chains--and
wings."</p>

<p>She laughed. "All right--only in Vance's case I'd rather be
the wing-giver."</p>

<p>"How do you know you're not chaining him up all the tighter?
The defenceless woman, and all that. If you were his wife, you
and he'd be on a level."</p>

<p>"The defenceless woman? Bless you, he never thinks of me as
that! He thinks only of his work--and his genius."</p>

<p>"Well, you wanted him to, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. And I want it still--with all my soul!"</p>

<p>"Then settle your own situation first. Let me tell Tarrant
you'll bring proceedings at once. I can almost promise he won't
make any difficulty."</p>

<p>She mused again, something deep down in her still resisting
this belated charity from either husband or lover. "It would be
such a mockery..."</p>

<p>"What would be?"</p>

<p>"The whole business. If I had my divorce my people would
expect me to marry Vance. And I can't--I can't. If there were a
divorce I couldn't prevent his hearing of it, and if he did he'd
feel he ought to marry me--and that might ruin his life, and ruin
mine too." She forced a faint smile. "If being happy is simple,
being happy with an artist isn't. It's been a beautiful
adventure, but, to adopt your bold metaphor, I want it to end
before the wings turn into chains."</p>

<p>She stood up, and Frenside also got to his feet. They stood
and looked at each other like people signalling out of hearing
across a hurrying river. At length Frenside spoke. "There's one
thing more. You say Weston doesn't worry about your
situation--doesn't think of it at all. Yet he did his best to get
Tarrant to yield about the divorce."</p>

<p>She returned to the present with a start. Was it possible, she
thought, that Vance had done that? It sent a flush of triumph
through her--yet how far away and improbable it all seemed!</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. He did it because some one had spoken to him rudely
about me. But he forgot all about it when I pretended I didn't
care."</p>

<p>"Ah--you pretended?"</p>

<p>She shrugged. "What's loving but pretending?"</p>

<p>Frenside stood looking at her with angry compassionate eyes.
"My poor girl--if it's come to that, why not crown the affair by
the biggest pretense of all? Let Weston think you want to be
free. He won't make any difficulty, will he?"</p>

<p>Halo stood silent, her head sunk, her eyes fixed on the
ground. This cruel surgeon of a Frenside--how straight he had
probed to the central pain!</p>

<p>"Let him think I want to leave him?"</p>

<p>"It's the logical conclusion, isn't it? The one towering
generosity that will justify the rest?"</p>

<p>She stood before him motionless. He was speaking to her with
her own inward voice, but she could not bear the words when
another spoke them. "He may be back now--any day," she brought
out.</p>

<p>"And then you'll begin the patching-up business all over
again?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>Frenside was silent. The travelling-clock on Vance's desk
ticked with sudden sonority, and she thought: "For how many weeks
now have I wound it up for him every Saturday?"</p>

<p>Frenside seemed to hear it also. He pulled out his watch. "By
Jove, I've got to be off. My taxi's waiting down by the hotel.
I've just got time to make my train."</p>

<p>She stood rooted to the ground, feeling that with the least
word or movement her great loneliness would break in tears. He
held out his hand. "I hate to leave you here, child."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Fren. But I've got to stay."</p>

<p>He turned away, and she listened to his short steps rapping
their way down the stairs and along the path to the gate.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Frenside had left her Halo tried to collect her thoughts;
but his visit had shaken her too deeply. He had roused her out of
her self-imposed torpor into a state of hyper-acute sensibility,
and detaching her from the plight in which she was entangled had
compelled her to view it objectively. What was her present
relation to Vance--what was their future together likely to be?
They had never quarrelled since the day at Granada when she had
reproached him for having gone to the party from which the old
Marquesa had excluded her. A mere honeymoon flurry; and since
then there had been unbroken outward harmony between them. Yet
how far they were from each other--much farther than the couples
who quarrelled and kissed again once a week, and to whom
quarrelling and kissing were all in the day's work. It was her
fault, no doubt. She had wanted the absolute--and life had handed
her one of its usual shabby compromises, and she had not known
what to do with it.</p>

<p>She shivered at the recollection of Frenside's advice.
Perhaps, as he said, true magnanimity would consist in leaving
Vance; but she had not strength for it, and the only alternative
was the patching-up business, as he called it. The patching-up
would have to begin all over again, and this time with little
faith, on her part, in the durability of the repairs. Was it not
unfair to Vance, and deteriorating to herself, to cling to a
relation that had grown less real than the emptiest marriage? Ah,
marriage--she understood now! The maddest of us need a
frame-work; perhaps the maddest most of all...Well, what of
it? Vance would marry her as soon as she was free; and an hour
ago she had received Tarrant's offer to release her!</p>

<p>At the thought all her doubts and scruples seemed like so much
morbid hair-splitting. Why should she and Vance not marry and
take their chance with other ordinary people? They might have a
child, and then there would be something about which to build the
frame-work. They would become a nucleus, their contradictory
cravings would meet in a common purpose, their being together and
belonging to each other would acquire a natural meaning. Her
heart swelled with the emotion she had suppressed during her talk
with Frenside--the healing tears ran over.</p>

<p>She sat down and wrote out a telegram to Vance. Then she tore
it up, and wrote another: this time to Tolby. Vance had not
answered any of her previous letters and telegrams, he might not
answer this one; it was safer to apply to his friend. "Fear have
lost a letter from Vance. If no longer with you please send me
his present address." She winced at the pretense of the lost
letter; but what did it matter? Her one object was to have
news.</p>

<p>She carried her telegram to the post office, and as she walked
along the glaring sea-front, past the sun-bathers sprawling on
the sand, and the light boats skimming before the breeze that
always sprang up toward sunset, the familiar scene grew suddenly
gay and inviting. How natural that these young people should be
enjoying it all! She felt young again herself, her heart beat in
tune with theirs. As long as one was alert and sound, and could
show a fresh face to one's glass, the world was a holiday place
after all. Tomorrow she was sure to hear from Vance...</p>

<p>The morrow, however, brought only a note from Frenside,
despatched from the station at Marseilles. Apparently, during his
visit, he had told her all his plans, though she had remembered
nothing of the first part of their talk except that he had given
her good news of her parents, and had said something about a trip
to Corsica or Sicily--she didn't know which. What an unnatural
monster she must have become, to have ears and memory only for
her own concerns! She had been brooding over them too long
alone.</p>

<p>Frenside gave an address at Palermo, and added that he would
be returning in a month to Paris, where, if she wished to write,
she could do so in care of his bankers. She hastily noted both
addresses, and wondered sadly if she would ever see him again.
Suddenly it occurred to her that he was probably travelling with
Tarrant, and that the latter might have been at Marseilles
awaiting her answer, or even--who knows?--at the hotel at Oubli.
She flushed up at the thought; but it was soon crowded out by
anxious speculations as to Tolby's reply. That evening seemed the
longest and loneliest she had spent since Vance had gone...</p>

<p>The next morning Tolby's telegram came. It read: "Vance left
England a fortnight ago. Gave me no address. Sorry." She sat and
puzzled over it till her eyes ached, as if it had been a cipher
of which she had forgotten the key. "Left England--left England:
no address." He had vanished into space again, and this time for
how long? Had it never occurred to him that in his absence
something might happen to her: that she might fall ill, or be
suddenly called home by illness in her family, or, for one reason
or another, need his presence--or at least require to communicate
with him?</p>

<p>Idle questions! The truth was that he had simply forgotten
her. But it is almost unbearable to be forgotten. The victim
invents a thousand pretexts rather than admit that one fact. Halo
smiled at her own credulity. The night Vance had gone off to
Fontainebleau without telling her that he was leaving she had
imagined that he might have had an accident, had thought of
applying to the police to have him traced. Luckily common-sense
had prevailed on that occasion, and she meant that it should on
this. She would simply wait and see. But meanwhile Frenside's
counsel returned to her. This man whom she could no longer make
happy, who needed her so little that he could disappear for weeks
without giving her a sign--how much longer was she going to
burden him with her unwanted devotion? Had they not reached the
hour for a magnanimous farewell?</p>

<p>She turned the problem over and over, too agitated to examine
it, too possessed by it to think of anything else. She tried to
rehearse the farewell scene (or the farewell letter--since there
was no knowing when he would come back); she tried to visualize
her solitary return to America, her meeting with her parents, the
painful effort of adapting herself to the new lonely life before
her: a woman without a lover, without a husband, without a child.
But her imagination shrank from the picture, and she lay all day
on the divan in Vance's study, her mind a formless darkness.</p>

<p>Toward evening came the postman's ring, and she dashed out
before the <i>bonne</i> could extricate herself from her
saucepans. Letters? Yes, there were letters. Several for Vance,
as usual: from publishers, from news agencies, from his tailor,
his dentist. But none for her from Vance. She took the letters up
to the study and added them to the pile already awaiting him. He
had asked her to forward only his personal correspondence and
that was small: most of the letters were obviously concerned with
his work, and these lay in orderly stacks on his desk. Many of
the envelopes bore the names of newspaper-cutting agencies. Vance
subscribed to none, but for that very reason they bombarded him
with appeals and tempted him with specimen paragraphs. She could
never bear to be long idle, and it occurred to her to go through
these envelopes, and select any cuttings that might interest him,
though she knew he would probably pitch them all in the
scrap-basket without a glance.</p>

<p>She went through them one by one, and gradually they built up
a picture of his London life: a much more worldly one than she
had imagined. While she had thought of him as chained to
"Colossus" he had been ranging from Mayfair to Bloomsbury,
spending his week-ends at fashionable country-houses, and even
condescending to let himself be interviewed. She smiled at the
change in him. The Vance she thought she knew would have loathed
such publicity...</p>

<p>She was more familiar than he with the intricate pattern of
social London, and it began to amuse her to trace his ascent from
the small chafing-dish parties with Tolby's painters and
art-critics to Lady Pevensey's gilded promiscuities, the
gathering of the elect at Charlie Tarlton's, and the final
apotheosis of the reading at Lady Guy Plunder's. Halo knew all
about Lady Guy Plunder and her rivalry with Charlie Tarlton. She
thought how happy Vance's publishers would be at the battle the
two were waging over the new celebrity. How funny to think of
Vance as a fashionable novelist! He had read fragments of
"Colossus" at Lady Guy's; the party had apparently been given for
that purpose. Halo found an account of it in one of the "society"
papers, ran over the list of names, all well-known, many
distinguished, and lit on the closing paragraph: "Among Mr.
Weston's most enthusiastic hearers on this very exclusive and
privileged occasion was his lovely compatriot Miss Floss Delaney,
whose father, Colonel Harrison Delaney of Virginia, has lately
bought back the old Delaney estate, 'Court Pride', on the James
River. Miss Delaney, who was a childhood friend of the brilliant
novelist's, had the luck to carry him off after the party to
Brambles, the enchanting little place in Surrey which Colonel
Delaney, who is said to lavish millions on his only child, has
hired for her for the summer. Many were the rival hostesses who
envied her for capturing the author of 'Colossus' for a
week-end."</p>

<p>She laid the paper down. Suddenly, among the other names,
familiar but indifferent, this one glared out at her. Floss
Delaney--? Halo blinked and tried to see the syllables more
clearly. Her mind ran back over the rambling distances of Vance's
early recollections. He had poured them out so profusely during
the first days of their friendship in New York, when talking with
her was his one refuge from loneliness, that she did not
immediately connect any definite association with this particular
name. Then, abruptly, a memory woke. Floss Delaney: it was the
name of the girl he had been infatuated with as a boy, the girl
he had surprised one day with his disreputable old grandfather,
at the spot where his own trysts with her had been held. This
girl...this vile creature who had given him his first bitter
insight into life...How his voice had choked as he stammered
out the shabby tale! Yes; it must be the same. It was difficult
to account for her sudden transformation into a fashionable
London figure; but Halo remembered that the girl's father was
said to have come of a good southern family, and she also
recalled that Vance, returning from Euphoria just before he and
she had left for Europe, had brought back the fairy-tale of the
Delaneys' sudden rise to wealth. Halo had been too much absorbed
in her own happiness to pay much heed at the time; but gradually
the story came back to her, even to Lorin Weston's resentful
comment on it: "And now the Delaneys have gone to Europe to blow
it all in Gay Paree!"</p>

<p>Yes; it all fitted into the pattern. Floss Delaney--Vance's
"childhood friend"! The idea was revolting. While Halo was
wearing out her soul for him he was spending his days in such
company! She felt as if she were puzzling over the actions of a
stranger. The Vance she loved would have recoiled with disgust
from such an encounter. It was bitter to think that these were
the companions he had chosen, the people who had been sharing his
pleasures, listening to his talk, perhaps receiving his
confidences and laughing at his inflammable enthusiasms, while
she, who had given him her life, sat alone, forgotten, as utterly
cut off from him as if she had never had any share in his
existence.</p>

<p>The crowning pretense! Yes: Frenside was right; it was time to
make it. She got up, and went into her own room. She would pack
her things and go--it was so easy: perhaps easier than she had
imagined. Why not begin at once? She would wind up everything
decently: pay off the servant, put the house in order, leave the
key with the agent--the old instinct of order reasserted itself
even at such a moment--and then pile her bags into a taxi, and
drive to the station. It was all perfectly easy...</p>

<p>She stood looking about, wondering how to begin. Her mind was
too tired--she couldn't think. After all it might be simpler to
write. She would certainly have to leave a letter; she would not
appear to retaliate by walking off without a word. And it might
be less difficult to take the final step after she had put her
reasons on paper...</p>

<p>She went back to Vance's desk and sat with her pen suspended
over a sheet of paper. Tell Vance that she was leaving him? It
was unthinkable! It would be easier to go away than to explain
her going. She would pack, and take the train to Paris, and just
before sailing she would leave a letter at his bank. She must get
away before her courage failed her...She crossed the room to
the bookshelves where Vance's few works were ranged, and drew out
the volume of short stories containing the tale he had written
after the discovery of Floss Delaney's betrayal. "One Day"--Halo
remembered the evening when Tarrant had brought it home, and she
had read it in a rush, her heart beating at the thought that
Lewis had discovered a new genius. Now the crudeness and
awkwardness of the story struck her; but she was mastered again
by the power of the presentation. Yes--it must have happened
exactly in that way. And how he must have suffered! There were
phrases like the cries of a trapped animal...She shut her
eyes, unable to read on. He had suffered thus agonizingly--as she
was suffering now--but by pouring his suffering into a story he
had been able to cleanse his soul of it. Ah, happy artists! No
wonder they were careless of other people's wounds, when they
were born with the power to heal their own so easily...</p>

<p>She must have fallen asleep. The room was dark when she awoke,
roused by a sound in the still house. The book fell to the floor
and she sat upright, brushing back the hair from her
forehead.</p>

<p>A ray of light was advancing up the stairway; behind it she
heard the <i>bonne</i> clumping up, lamp in hand.</p>

<p>"Monsieur wants to know if Madame will have dinner
out-of-doors--there's a moon..."</p>

<p>"Monsieur?" Halo stared confusedly at the woman, whose coarse
good-natured features were grotesquely foreshortened by the
upward slant of the light. To Halo the goblin figure seemed a
part of her dream. What was it saying to her? Monsieur--?</p>

<p>"Monsieur got back an hour ago. When I told him that Madame
seemed very tired and had fallen asleep he said not to disturb
her, and he'd go first for a swim. But he'll be back now, hungry
for his dinner, so I had to wake Madame...There's not much in
the house, but I think I can manage a <i>souffl&eacute;.</i>
Shall I carry the table out into the garden--yes?"</p>

<p>She put the lamp on the desk and clumped down again to her
kitchen. Halo continued to sit on the edge of the divan, only
half wakened out of her exhausting sleep. She got to her feet at
last, looking about her vaguely. Then she lifted the lamp and
carried it into her bedroom. She put it down on a corner of her
dressing-table, and peered at her reflection in the glass. Her
face was almost as grotesquely illuminated as the servant's; her
eyes looked swollen with sleep, her cheeks drawn and sallow. "I'm
an old woman," she thought. "How can he ever care for me
again?"</p>

<p>She heard a familiar call from the garden.
"Halo--Ha<i>lo!"</i> and jumped up, quivering, one happy
heart-beat from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Oh, Vanny! Coming!"</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c32">XXXII</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Vance stood in the little study and looked about him. He had
been gone only a few weeks, yet he felt like a grown man
revisiting the house he has lived in as a child, and finding that
the rooms he thought he had remembered so vividly are unfamiliar,
and different from his recollection. He looked at Halo, and she
too seemed strange. Had she always been so pale, with such
shadows in the hollows of her lids? At the corners of her mouth
there were little lines he had never before noticed.</p>

<p>"You haven't been ill, have you?" he asked with sudden
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Ill? No. Do I look so? I suppose the heat's been rather
wearing...But I loved it," she added, as though to quiet his
fears.</p>

<p>"But Sidonie said you'd been lying down all day, and that you
don't eat anything."</p>

<p>"What nonsense! She's bored because you haven't been here to
devour her <i>bouillabaisse</i> and sea-urchins."</p>

<p>Vance continued to scrutinize her. "I oughtn't to have left
you so long alone," he said, as if he were speaking to
himself.</p>

<p>"Why, Van, how absurd! You needed the change--and I wanted to
stay. Now tell me all about 'Colossus'."</p>

<p>It was curious, how strange their voices sounded; his own no
less then hers. He seemed to be moving in a mist of strangeness,
through which he barely discerned her, remote and ghostly, though
his arm was about her and her shoulder against his. "This
closeness," he thought desperately, "I suppose it's the only real
distance..."</p>

<p>She drew him toward the stairs. "Come, darling, let's go down.
Sidonie has put the table outside, under the old mulberry."</p>

<p>"Under the mulberry?" At the word he was again in the garden
at Brambles, assailed by the rush of images against which he had
been battling for three desperate weeks. He felt tired, bruised,
inarticulate. Would he ever again learn to fit into this
forgotten life?</p>

<p>"Yes, come; it'll be terribly jolly," he agreed, his arm in
hers.</p>

<p>She leaned close, her face lifted, wrinkling her eyes in the
way he liked. "Oh, Van, you <i>are</i> glad to be back?"</p>

<p>"Glad? You old darling!" They went down into the garden
together.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>During his miserable wanderings since he had left England he
had imagined that the healing springs would flow as soon as he
got back to the pink house. There were days when the longing to
be there, when the blind animal craving for Halo's nearness, was
so strong that only a vague sense of shame and unworthiness kept
him away. He had wanted, in some dim way, to suffer more before
he brought his sufferings to be comforted. And now he and she
were sitting together under the mulberry in the moonlight, the
lights of the little house blinking out at them, the old whisper
of the sea in their ears, and he was not really there, and the
woman opposite to him was as strange and far away as the
scene.</p>

<p>The mere fact that she was so patient with him, didn't nag,
didn't question, didn't taunt, somehow added to the sense of her
remoteness. Did that curious tolerance make her less woman, less
warm to the touch? He had been bracing himself for a struggle,
holding himself on the defensive, dreaming of reproaches that
should end in tears and kisses; and her quiet unquestioning
tenderness was like a barrier. "I shall be better when I get back
to work," he thought.</p>

<p>After dinner they sat on in the garden, under the great warm
moon, and fragments of talk floated between them on a dividing
sea of silence. At length she asked him if he wasn't tired, and
he said he was, and got up to help her carry the table in under
the glazed porch. Sidonie had gone to bed, and Halo stayed below
to clear away the dishes while Vance went up to the study. When
he re-entered it alone the room seemed more familiar, the sense
of constraint and strangeness fell away. How orderly and
welcoming it all looked--the flowers in the brown jar, the quiet
circle of lamplight on the letters and papers neatly sorted for
his inspection, his old armchair, and the divan where Chris
Churley used to sprawl...</p>

<p>Vance began to turn over his correspondence. He was not in the
mood for letters, but his glance lingered on a bunch of
newspaper-cuttings held together by a clip. Evidently Halo had
sorted them, and kept those that she thought might interest him.
This proof of her care gave him a soothing sense of warmth and
ease. He didn't give a fig for newspaper cuttings, but he liked
the thought that she had prepared them for him.</p>

<p>He detached the clip and his eyes ran over the articles. He
was still looking at them when she came upstairs, and bent above
his shoulder. He looked up at her. "You picked these out for
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I know you don't care for them as a rule, but I thought
these few might amuse you."</p>

<p>He continued to look at her. "They were about the only news
you had of me, weren't they? I ought to have written oftener--I
meant to."</p>

<p>"What does it matter, now you're back?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's the great thing, isn't it?" He laughed, and
pressed her hand against his cheek.</p>

<p>"Don't sit up too late, Van. You look awfully tired."</p>

<p>"No. I'll just go through the rest." Her hand slipped from his
shoulder, and he heard her cross the floor and go into her own
room. The sound of her moving about there, as she prepared for
the night, was pleasant to him, like the purr of a fire on the
hearth, the blink of a light through a familiar window. He turned
back to the articles, and read on, unwilling to admit that they
interested him more than he had suspected. Formerly, when life
and his work were in harmony, he had been indifferent to this
kind of publicity, contemptuous of it; but now it helped to
restore his shaken self-confidence. After all, when people talk
about a fellow as these papers did he's not exactly a nonentity,
is he?</p>

<p>He read on to the last cutting. It was the account of his
evening at Lady Guy Plunder's. The report was cleverly done, and
it amused and excited him to reconstitute the scene. Halo had
read the notice too, he reflected, and no doubt her pride in him
had been flattered. He glowed secretly with the reflection of
that pride. And then he came to the last paragraph, that which
recounted his departure for Brambles. Who could have given that
information, he wondered? Why, Alders, of course--it was Alders
who had telephoned to Floss.</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Vance's temples. He concluded instantly
that Halo must have read this article, must have seen his name
coupled with that of the girl of whom he had spoken with such
scorn and self-loathing...He felt mortified at what her
judgment of him must be, and resentful, almost, that she should
have exposed him to divining it. Had she put that particular
cutting there on purpose? No doubt it was to attract his notice
that she had filed it under the others, let them lead him up to
it unsuspectingly. He felt a rush of anger at the idea that she
knew his weaknesses and was concealing her real thoughts about
him. He wasn't going to be pitied by anybody, least of all by
her...</p>

<p>Hitherto he had never found either consolation or excitement
in drink. He had seen too much drunkenness all his life to be
shocked, or even actively disgusted, by the sight of it in
others; but he felt a cold contempt for the fools who could blur
their minds and besot their bodies when life was so short, and
every minute of it so packed with marvels. The sheer waste of
drunkenness was what revolted him. But now he felt a sudden
longing to blot out at a stroke all the tormenting memories of
the last weeks, and the exasperating sense of his own weakness.
"It's all a failure--everything I touch is a failure," he
thought. He went to the cupboard in which Halo kept the bottles
of spirits, and cocktail ingredients, and poured himself out a
stiff measure of gin-and-soda. He drank it down, and felt better.
He filled another glass, and drank that too; then he threw
himself onto the divan, heavy with fatigue and sleep. But in
another moment he was sitting up again, his brain tingling with
excitement. Halo had ceased to move about in her room; the house
had become intensely silent, and the silence frightened him. He
felt the same awful loneliness as when, after Laura Lou's death,
he had sat in the tumbledown bungalow while she lay on the other
side of the closed door. He began to tremble at the memory. If
Halo were dead! If he were to open that door and go in, and find
her on the bed white and waxen, like Laura Lou. He started up,
and went to her door and opened it. She was in bed; over the
chair beside her hung her old red silk dressing-gown, the one she
had thrown over her when she had met him on the night of his
return from Fontainebleau. The hair lay loose on her forehead, as
it had then, and she sat propped against her pillows, a candle
faintly lighting her pale face.</p>

<p>"Not asleep?" he said in a sheepish voice, sitting down by her
and furtively stroking the folds of the dressing gown.</p>

<p>"No; it's too hot." She looked at him. "Aren't you going to
bed?"</p>

<p>He got up restlessly, and wandered to the window. "This
light'll bring in mosquitoes."</p>

<p>She blew out the candle and he came back and knelt down beside
her. "Halo, I'm a damned fool--a damned worthless fool." He hid
his face against the sheet, and felt her hand in his hair. He
melted at the reassurance of her touch, the feeling that it was
drawing him out of himself and back into the old warm shelter of
habit.</p>

<p>"I'd have come back sooner--only I wasn't fit to," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"Silly Van!"</p>

<p>"But now I want to get back; take up our old life. It's not
too late, is it? Some time I'll tell you--don't ask me to now,
will you? Just say if it's possible still--if you're not done
with me...If you are, tell me that too--straight out. I can't
sleep till I know if it's really you here, or only a ghost of
you, who's sorry for me. I don't want that either...I'd rather
get out now, and go on..." He hardly knew what he was saying;
the words tumbled out as they could.</p>

<p>He felt her lean over and lay her arm on his neck. She did not
attempt to draw him to her; her arm trembled a little as it
touched him. "I'm here," she said, so low that he hardly heard.
He buried his head against her, and was still.</p>

<p>The days that followed passed quietly. Halo was nervously
conscious of every word and look of Vance's, yet determined that
he should not see she was watching him. After his outburst of
remorse and tenderness on the night of his return he seemed to
have slipped back into his usual attitude toward her, except that
she was aware of something shy and dependent in him, something
that besought her compassion yet would have resented her showing
it. The thing to do, she told herself again and again, was just
to be natural, to behave as if nothing were changed; and
gradually she felt that he was becoming used to her, and to the
life out of which some mysterious influence had abruptly wrenched
him.</p>

<p>She refrained from questioning him about his weeks in England,
and he never spoke of them except, now and then, to allude to an
encounter with some critic or writer whom she knew he had wished
to meet. To the social side of the adventure he never referred;
nor did he mention the interval which had elapsed between his
taking leave of Tolby and his reappearance at Oubli.</p>

<p>Tolby thought he had left England--or said so. But did he
know? Perhaps Vance had simply vanished from Tolby's ken without
revealing his plans. Why should he have been so secretive about
them unless he had wished to conceal his whereabouts, and what
motive for concealment could he have had except that he had gone
away with some woman? The riddle continued to revolve in Halo's
brain, but she tried to ignore it; and as the days slipped by,
and she saw Vance gradually settling down into his old habits of
work, the whole matter seemed less important. Whatever had
happened, it was probably over; he had passed through a phase,
and come back to her--and that was all that mattered.</p>

<p>The summer was coming to an end; the tumultuous sun-bathers
were vanishing from bungalows and restaurants, scattering with
their wireless sets and shrieking motors to all the points of the
compass, and leaving Oubli to the quietness of autumn. Already
the great arched avenues of planes had turned into golden
tunnels, the kindled vineyards were flushing to flame and embers,
the figs purpling through their fanlike foliage. The pink house
was almost the only one that had not barred its shutters for the
dead interval between the seasons. When Halo and Vance went down
to bathe they had the bay almost to themselves; in their rambles
through the olive terraces and among the pine-woods they met no
more "hikers", and the cry of Ford and Citro&euml;n grew remoter
through the sylvan hush.</p>

<p>Vance was more silent than of old; but though he had no
explosions of enthusiasm he seemed as sensitive as ever to the
beauty about him. To Halo he was like some one recovering from a
long illness, and yielding gradually to the returning spell of
life; there were moments when she could hardly help lowering her
voice and treading as if in a sick-room--yet she knew nothing
would irritate him more than any sign of exaggerated sympathy.
"Be natural, be natural," she kept repeating to herself,
wondering if there were any lesson in the world as hard to
learn.</p>

<p>Sooner than she could have hoped he returned to his work;
there were days when he threw himself into it with such sombre
ardour that she feared for his health and urged him not to write
for too many hours at a stretch. But he received the suggestion
irritably, and she saw that she must adapt herself to these days
and nights of furious labour, which alternated with others of
heavy lassitude. After a while she noticed that he had begun to
drink to make up for the exhaustion following on his long bouts
of writing. The discovery was a shock, and half-jokingly she
tried to hint her surprise. In former times, she knew, Vance
would have been humiliated by any allusion to such a weakness;
but he received her hints with a sort of bantering indifference.
"I know--you women think God created the universe on lemonade and
lettuce sandwiches. Well, maybe He did; but I can't. Don't be
frightened--you haven't acquired an habitual drunkard. But I've
got to get this book off my chest somehow, and I can't do it
without being bucked up now and then. I wish you'd tell Sidonie
to make me a good thermos-ful of black coffee every night, will
you? She can leave it on my desk when she goes to bed."</p>

<p>Hitherto he had not spoken of the progress of his book; but
Halo was used to that now. Since the old days at the Willows he
had never really taken her into his confidence while his work was
in hand. Even when he was writing "The Puritan in Spain", in the
solitude of their long <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> at
Cadiz, he had used her as an ear to listen, not as an
intelligence to criticize. And since he had been in England he
had taken to doing his own typing, so that even her services on
the Remington were no longer required, and his book was a secret
garden into which he shut himself away from her as he might have
done into a clandestine love-affair. But one afternoon, as they
lay under the olives on the hillside, he turned to her with a
half-shy half-whimsical smile. "See here; I'm beginning to wonder
whether you're going to take to 'Colossus'."</p>

<p>She smiled back at him. "So am I!"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it's about time we tried it out. I want to
know how it strikes you."</p>

<p>She tried to repress her eagerness, to look friendly yet not
too flattered. "I want to know too, dear--whenever you feel like
it." As they scrambled down the hill through the golden twilight
she seemed to be carried on wings. "He's come back to me--he's
come back to me!" she exulted, as if this need of her
intellectual help were a surer token of his return to her than
any revival of passion.</p>

<p>The book had advanced much farther than she had expected. In
spite of the social distractions of London, Vance had got on with
his writing more rapidly there than during the quiet months at
Oubli, and as Halo looked at the heaped-up pages she asked
herself whether a change of scene--figurative as well as
actual--might not be increasingly necessary to him, and at more
frequent intervals. On the night of his return he had confessed
to her that he had been a fool, that he would have come back
sooner if he had not been ashamed of his folly; but perhaps the
experience he had in mind, whatever it was, had roused his
intellectual activity and fed the creative fires. It was all
mysterious and unintelligible to Halo, whose own happiness was so
dependent on stability and understanding; but her intelligence
could divine what perplexed her heart. At any rate, she thought
with secret triumph, he hasn't found any one to replace me as a
listener.</p>

<p>That very evening he began to read the book aloud. They had
meant to take the chapters in instalments; Halo had stipulated
for time to reflect, and to get the work into its proper
perspective. But when Vance was in the mood for reading aloud the
excitement of getting a new view of what he had written always
swept him on from page to page, and the joy of listening, and the
sense that for the first time since the writing of "Instead" he
needed her not only as audience but as critic, kept Halo from
interrupting him. By the time he had finished they were both
exhausted, Vance almost voiceless, and Halo in a state of nervous
agitation that made it difficult for her to speak, though she
knew he was impatient for what she had to say. He waited a
moment; then he gave an uneasy laugh. "Well--?"</p>

<p>"Van--" she began; but she broke off, embarrassed.</p>

<p>He was gathering the pages together with affected
indifference. "No reaction--that about it?"</p>

<p>"No; oh, no! Only--you remember that time I took you to
Chartres?" She smiled, but there was no answering light in his
face. He was looking down sullenly at the manuscript.</p>

<p>"I remember I was as dead as a mummy. Couldn't see or feel
anything. I suppose you're in the same state now?" he suggested
ironically.</p>

<p>"Nonsense; you weren't dead, you were stunned, bewildered. And
so am I--just at first. I want more time--I want to re-read it
quietly."</p>

<p>"Oh, the critic who asks for a reprieve has already formed his
opinion." He laughed again. "Come--out with it! What's wrong with
the book? I don't know why you take me for such a thin-skinned
idiot that I can't bear to be told."</p>

<p>She saw that his lips were twitching, and suddenly suspected
that he himself was not wholly satisfied with what he had
written, and had feared in advance that she might share his
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd let me sleep over it," she urged
good-humouredly. "I really don't know yet what I think."</p>

<p>"You mean you don't know how to sugar-coat it," he
interrupted. "Well, don't try! Just say straight out how the book
strikes you. Remember that an artist is never much affected by
amateur judgments, anyway."</p>

<p>She flushed up at the sneer. "In that case, mine can surely
wait."</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't have to! I know already what you think. You
don't understand what I'm after, and so you assume that I've
muddled it. That's about it, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The taunt was too great a strain on her patience. If he had to
be praised at all costs she felt that he was lost; he must be
shaken out of this lethargy of self-appreciation. "Isn't it
rather too easy to conclude that if your critics are not
altogether pleased it's because they're incapable of
understanding you?"</p>

<p>He swung round with an ironic smile. "Which simply means that
you're not al-to-gether pleased yourself?" he mimicked her.</p>

<p>"No; I'm not. But I don't think the reason you suggest is the
right one."</p>

<p>"Naturally!" He caught himself up, and went on more quietly:
"Well, then, what <i>is</i> the reason?"</p>

<p>Halo's heart was beating apprehensively. Why was she thus
deliberately risking their newly-recovered understanding? Was it
worth while to put his literary achievement above her private
happiness--and perhaps his? She was not sure; but she had to
speak as her mind moved her. "I'll tell you as well as I can. I'm
a little bewildered still; but I have an idea you haven't found
yourself--expressed your real self, I mean--in this book as you
did in the others. You're not...not quite as free from other
influences...echoes..." As the words formed themselves she
knew they were the most fatal to the artist's self-love, the
hardest for wounded vanity to recover from. But if she spoke at
all she must speak as truth dictated; she could not tamper with
her intellectual integrity, or with his.</p>

<p>Vance had dropped back into his chair. "Echoes!" he said with
a curt laugh. "That's all you see--all you hear, rather? What
sort of echoes?"</p>

<p>"Of books you've been reading, I suppose; or the ideas of the
people you've been talking to. I can't speak more definitely,
because I've been with you so little lately, and it's so long
since you've talked to me of your work. But I feel that you may
have let yourself be too much guided, directed--drawn away from
your own immediate vision."</p>

<p>"In other words, if I'd submitted the book to you page by page
I should have been more likely to preserve what you call my
immediate vision? Is that it?"</p>

<p>The outbreak was so childish that it restored her balance, and
she smiled. "I can't tell about that, of course; but if you think
such a consideration would really affect my opinion, I wonder at
your ever caring to hear it."</p>

<p>Vance gave a shrug. "My dear child--shall I give you the cold
truth, as you've given it to me? It's simply this: that the
artist asks other people's opinions to please <i>them</i> and not
to help himself. There's only one critic who can help us--that's
life! As for the rest, it's all bunk..." He pushed the pages
into their folder, and got up, stretching his arms above his
head. "You're right, anyhow, about our both being too dog-tired
to keep up the discussion now. It was brutal of me to put you
through the third degree at two in the morning..."</p>

<p>Halo's heart sank. She did not resent his tone; she knew he
was overwrought, and was talking with his nerves and not with his
intelligence; but again she was frightened by the idea that her
over-scrupulous sincerity might check his impulse to turn to her
for advice and sympathy. "And after all," she reflected, "it's
only sympathy that matters. He's right, in a sense, when he says
it's about the only thing an artist requires of his friends. As
for the work itself, self-criticism is all that counts." She
looked at him gaily.</p>

<p>"It's not two in the morning yet; but I <i>am</i> tired, and
so are you. I wish you hadn't made me feel that I can't help you.
If only by listening, by giving you my whole mind, I believe I
can; but you'll be able to tell better tomorrow. At any rate, you
must give me the chance to explain a little more clearly what I
feel."</p>

<p>He looked embarrassed, and half-ashamed of his outburst. "Of
course, child. We'll talk it all over when our heads are a little
clearer. Now I believe I'll go to bed." He went up to the
cupboard and poured himself out a glass of whisky. As he emptied
it he turned to her with a laugh and a toss of his head above the
tilted glass. "Here's to my next book--a best-seller, to be
written under your guidance." He tapped her on the shoulder and
turned her face toward his for a kiss.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c33">XXXIII</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>One day he said to her: "Well, the book's finished." He spoke
in a low apprehensive voice, as if he had been putting off the
announcement as long as possible, and now that it was made, did
not know what to say next.</p>

<p>Since the night, weeks before, when Halo had ventured her
criticism he had never again proposed to show her what he was
doing, never even asked her to take his dictation or to copy out
his manuscript; he had definitely excluded the subject of
"Colossus" from their talks. The intellectual divorce between
them was increasingly bitter to Halo. That the veil of passion
must wear through was life's unescapable lesson; but if no deeper
understanding underlay it, what was left? Had not Frenside's
advice been the only answer? In the joy of Vance's return, and
the peaceful communion of their first days, when the mere fact of
being together seemed to settle every doubt and lay every ghost,
it had been easy to smile at her old friend's suggestion, and to
reflect how little any one could know of lovers' hearts except
the lovers. But now she understood on what unstable ground she
had rebuilt her happiness, and trembled.</p>

<p>Vance stood in the window looking out over the bay. The palms
were wrestling in dishevelled fury with the first autumn gale;
rain striped the panes, and beyond the headlands a welter of
green waters stretched away to the low pall of clouds. Halo saw
him give a discouraged shrug. "Good Lord--Miss Plummet!"</p>

<p>The Pension Britannique had reopened its shutters the previous
week, and after a prelude of carpet-shaking and tile-scrubbing
Madame Fleuret's lodgers were taking possession of their old
quarters. The Anglican chapel was to resume its offices on the
following Sunday; already Halo had encountered Mrs. Dorman,
cordial though embarrassed, and eager to tell her that after the
first rains a bad leak had shown itself in Lady Dayes-Dawes's
room, and that the mason was afraid they would have to rebuild
the chimney of the lounge.</p>

<p>Halo stood by Vance watching Miss Plummet swept homeward by
the south-easterly blast, her umbrella bellying like a black
sail. After she had passed there was an interval during which the
promenade remained empty, like a stage-setting before the leading
actor's entrance; then, punctually as of old, Colonel Churley
stalked into view, his mackintosh flapping, his stick dragging in
the mud, his head thrust out angrily to meet the gale. Vance
followed his struggling figure with fascinated eyes. "I suppose
they all think they're alive!" he groaned.</p>

<p>Halo laid her arm on his shoulder. She knew what thoughts the
sight of Colonel Churley had stirred in him. "Why should we stay
here any longer?" she said.</p>

<p>Vance drummed on the pane without answering. His eyes still
followed the bent figure lessening between the palm-trunks.</p>

<p>"Now that your book's finished--"</p>

<p>"Oh, my book! I don't believe it is a book--just a big dump of
words. And not mine, anyhow; you've made that clear enough!" He
gave an irritated laugh.</p>

<p>"I have? But you only let me hear a few chapters."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And on those you gave me your judgment of the
finished book. Without a moment's hesitation. Look here, child,"
he added abruptly, "don't think I was surprised, or that I
minded. Not in the least. It's the sign of the amateur critic
that he must always conclude, never leave an opinion in
solution."</p>

<p>Halo's arm dropped from his shoulder. "Then it can't much
matter to the author what the conclusion is."</p>

<p>Vance stood uneasily shifting from one foot to the other, his
eyes bent to the ground. "If only it didn't matter! The devil of
it is that when a book's growing the merest stupidest hint may
deflect its growth, deform it...The artist loses confidence,
ceases to visualize...Oh, what's the use of trying to
explain?"</p>

<p>"Don't try, dear. You're too tired, for one thing."</p>

<p>"Tired--tired? When a man's at the end of his tether a woman
always thinks he's tired. Why don't you suggest a bottle of
tonic?"</p>

<p>"If you're at the end of your tether it would be more to the
point to suggest new pastures. Why shouldn't we try some other
place?"</p>

<p>He moved away and began his restless pacing; then he came back
and paused before her. "It's the landscape of the soul I'm fed up
with," he broke out.</p>

<p>She stood silent. The landscape of the soul! But that must
mean his nearest surroundings--must mean herself, she supposed.
She tried to steady the smile on her trembling lips. "I wish
you'd let me help you as I used to," she began. "But if I'm of no
use to you in your work, and only in the way at other times,
perhaps..." She felt a blur in her eyes, and hurried on.
"Perhaps the real change you need--" and now she achieved a
little laugh--"is not a new place but a new woman."</p>

<p>The words dropped into a profound silence. Was he never going
to speak, to deny, to protest at the monstrousness of her
suggestion? He stood in the window, looking out into the rain,
for a time that seemed to her interminable; and when he turned
back his face was expressionless, closed. She felt as if a door
had been shut against her. She essayed her little laugh again.
"Is that it? Don't be afraid to tell me!"</p>

<p>"That?" He looked at her vaguely. "Oh--another woman?" He
stopped, and then began, in a hard embarrassed voice: "I suppose
you put that newspaper cutting on my desk on purpose the night I
came back? You wanted me to understand that you knew?"</p>

<p>She returned his look in genuine bewilderment. The weeks since
his return had been crowded with so many emotions and agitations
that for the moment she had forgotten the paragraph in which
Floss Delaney figured. Suddenly the memory rushed back on her,
and she stood speechless. It was that, then--her first instinct
had been right, had led her straight to his secret! She stiffened
herself, trying to thrust back the intolerable truth. "What
cutting? You mean--about that girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, Vance...you don't...you don't mean that it's for
her...?" There was another silence. "You mean that when you
left London it was to go away with her?"</p>

<p>He gave an angry laugh. "It was to go away <i>from</i> her--as
far as I could go! Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>Halo's eyes clung to his labouring face. Did she
understand--dared she? She spoke very low. "To get away from her
...because you realized...? Because it was all over--like
a bad dream? Is that it?"</p>

<p>"A bad dream, yes; but not over. I'd rather you knew
everything now...I didn't run away from her..."</p>

<p>"Then--?"</p>

<p>"She kicked me out. Can't you see? Do I have to put everything
in words of one syllable?"</p>

<p>Halo looked away from him. "No; you don't have to." Suddenly
her contracted heart seemed to expand a very little. "Then those
weeks after you left London--when Tolby said he didn't know what
had become of you--she wasn't with you all that time?"</p>

<p>"Merciful heaven--she? No!"</p>

<p>"Then where were you, Vance?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in hell. I believe they call it Belgium."</p>

<p>"All alone there, all that time?" she cried pityingly. He
mistook her intonation.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that as fast as one woman throws me over I
hook on to another--like a sort of limpet?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of another woman. I hoped you'd had one of
your friends with you."</p>

<p>"A man's got no friends when he's going through a thing like
that..." He stopped, and then a rush of words broke from him.
"You don't know--how should you? She threw me out; and I trailed
back after her to London; and she threw me out again. That time I
had my lesson."</p>

<p>He dropped into his armchair and leaned back, looking up at
the ceiling. She thought how young his face looked in spite of
its drawn misery, and said to herself: "He'll get over it and I
shan't. He'll use it up in a story, and it will go on living in
me and feeding on me." Aloud she said: "I'm very sorry for you,
Vance. I shouldn't have thought--"</p>

<p>"No! I understand. You'd have thought it would be any other
woman--only not that one. Well, it's the other way round. I'm
pitiably constant." He continued to lean back, his arms crossed
behind his head. He no longer looked at her, seemed hardly to
know she was there; yet every word he spoke cut like a blade
sharpened to wound her. She leaned against the desk, her arms
stretched behind her for support. She felt a kind of inner
rigidity that almost seemed like strength. While it lasted, she
thought, she must speak. "If you feel like that you must marry
her. You're free, dear--you know that."</p>

<p>He started up with a choking sound in his throat. "Marry her?
She's going to marry somebody else." He buried his face in his
hands and sat a long while without speaking. He was not weeping;
his shoulders did not stir; he just sat there in dark communion
with his grief. Halo did not move either till she felt a
stiffness in the muscles of her arms; then she turned from the
desk and stood looking out of the window at the storm-darkened
world. As she stood there Colonel Churley went by, driven back by
the storm from his solitary tramp. How she had pitied him last
winter, when she and Vance, from the safe shelter of their love,
had looked out on his lonely figure!</p>

<p>Night was falling; soon the lamp-lighter would come along and
the gas-lamps along the promenade flicker into life. They said
the streets would be lit by electricity next year. Their landlord
had even spoken of putting in an electric cooker...That
reminded Halo that if they meant to leave Oubli she ought to
write at once and give notice. You sent your landlord a
registered letter, and then he couldn't say that he hadn't been
notified, because there was his signature.</p>

<p>She turned back into the room, which was already dark, groped
for matches, and lit the two candles in the brass candlesticks on
the chimney. The fibres of her heart were wound about every
object in that homely friendly room. How many evenings she and
Vance had sat there, between fire and candles, joking and
planning! One flesh--they had been one flesh. And now they were
to be divided. She felt like some one facing a surgical
operation: the kind of which the surgeons say to the family:
"There <i>have</i> been cases in which it has proved successful;
and if it's not done we refuse to answer for the
consequences."</p>

<p>She tried to picture what her future would be--what she
herself would be--if the operation were to be successful. Perhaps
in the end she would marry somebody else, have children, live on
as a totally different being, preoccupied about ordering another
man's dinner and bringing up his family, though the same face
continued to look back at her from her mirror. How odd if in
years to come she should meet Vance somewhere--in the street, in
a train--and they should not recognize each other, and some one,
perhaps her husband, should say afterward: "You didn't know? Why,
that's the man who wrote 'Colossus'. I thought you used to know
him. That handsome common-looking woman was his wife."</p>

<p>Vance stood up, shook himself and passed his hand over his
forehead. "I think I'll go out."</p>

<p>Halo moved toward him. She must make use of her factitious
energy before it flickered out. "Vance--just a minute. I want to
tell you..."</p>

<p>He stopped unwillingly. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"You're free as air. You understand that, don't you?"</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes and looked at her heavily. "You mean--you
want to make an end?"</p>

<p>Her voice was hardly audible, even to her own ears. "Hadn't we
better?"</p>

<p>He still looked at her in a wounded suffering way. "All right,
then; I understand."</p>

<p>"Vance--it's better, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's all I'm worth."</p>

<p>She went closer to him. "Oh, not that--don't say that! I only
want you to feel that if there's any hope...any happiness for
you...elsewhere...I want you..." Her voice grew
suddenly louder, and then broke into a sob. The tide of her tears
rushed over her. She dropped down on the divan and wept as if she
were weeping away all the accumulated agony of the last weeks.
How brief a way her strength had carried her! She fought back her
tears, straightened herself, and lifted her face to his. "This is
nothing--just nervousness. I suppose I've been alone too long..."</p>

<p>He knelt down at her side, and she felt his arms about her.
Their treacherous warmth melted her resistance away. "Oh, Van...my
Van..." while he held her thus, could any other woman
come between them?</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c34">BOOK V</a></h1>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XXXIV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>From the window of every English bookshop in Paris "Colossus"
stared at Halo. The book had appeared a few weeks after its last
pages were written, the chapters having been set up as they were
finished, in order to hasten publication. Otherwise the winter
sales would be missed, and "Colossus" was obviously not a work
for the summer holidays. Halo suspected that the publishers,
while proud to associate their name with it, were not sanguine as
to pecuniary results. "Colossus" had most of the faults
disquieting to the book-seller; it was much too long, nothing
particular happened in it, and few people even pretended to know
what it was about.</p>

<p>No reviews had as yet appeared when Halo saw the first copies
in the rue de Rivoli windows, where they must have flowered over
night. She stood hesitatingly outside the shop; there had come to
be something slow and hesitating in her slightest decisions, in
her movements even. She found it more and more difficult to make
up her mind even about trifles--more so about trifles than about
the big decisive acts. The spring of enthusiasm that used to give
a momentary importance to the least event seemed to have run dry
in her.</p>

<p>She went in and asked for a magazine. While it was being
brought she glanced at the copies of "Colossus" conspicuously
aligned on the New Book counter, and asked the clerk how it was
going.</p>

<p>"We've sold a good many already. Anything by the author of
'The Puritan in Spain', you understand...Can I do up a copy
for you?"</p>

<p>It was the answer she had expected. The book would benefit for
a while by its predecessor's popularity; but when that
flagged--what? She paid for the magazine she had asked for, and
went out.</p>

<p>It was a cold day of early winter, and Paris, once like home
to her, seemed empty and unfriendly. She had seen no one since
her arrival. Lorry, she had learned at his studio, was away. Both
Mrs. Glaisher and Mrs. Blemer had failed in the end to regard
"Factories" as a profitable venture, and he was negotiating for
its production with a Berlin impresario. Halo had not the heart
to look up Savignac--again her stealing inertia held her back;
and Tolby, whom she would have been glad to see, was still in
London. Paris had been a feverish desert to her before; now it
was a freezing one.</p>

<p>She walked back through the Tuileries gardens, and across the
Seine to the quiet hotel on the left bank where she was staying.
She had lingered on alone in Paris for a week or ten days--ever
since she had come there to see Vance off, when he had hurriedly
sailed for New York--and she had a queer feeling that there was
no use in trying to make any further plans, that any change, any
new decision, must be imposed on her from the outside. It was as
though her central spring were broken...yet, in a way, she
knew that her future had already been settled for her.</p>

<p>At her hotel she asked the porter if there were any letters.
She was sure he would say no; of course there would be none; and
when, after a hunt through the pigeon-holes behind his desk, he
handed her an envelope, she felt suddenly dizzy, and had to sit
down on the nearest chair and leave the letter unopened. How
strange, how incredible, to see herself addressed as "Mrs.
Tarrant" in her husband's writing! It reminded her that in spite
of all that had happened she was still Mrs. Tarrant, still his
wife--and it was by his own choice that it was so. That was the
strangest part of it, the part she could not yet understand.</p>

<p>She had learned of Tarrant's presence in Paris by seeing his
name among the hotel arrivals in a daily paper. That was two days
ago; and after twenty-four hours of incoherent thinking she had
abruptly decided to move to another hotel, and register there
under her real name--her husband's. That night she had written to
him. That night; and here, the very next morning, was his answer!
One might almost have supposed that he had been waiting for some
sign from her...She sat with her cold hands folded over the
letter till her strength returned; when she could trust herself
to her feet she rose and went up to her room.</p>

<p>The variableness of Tarrant's moods had made her fear that he
might reply harshly, or perhaps not at all. Even now she thought
it likely that, if he should agree to see her, he would propose
their meeting at his lawyer's; and that would paralyze her,
deprive her of all power to plead her cause. Over three months
had passed since he had sent Frenside to her on that unsuccessful
mission; and as she looked back on her own attitude at the time
it seemed hard and ungrateful. In her self-absorption she had
forgotten to send Tarrant a word of thanks, a conciliatory
message; and she knew the importance he attached to such
observances. For her sake he had humbled his pride, and she had
seemed unaware of it. With his sensitiveness to rebuffs, and the
uncertainty of his impulses, what chance was there of finding him
in the same frame of mind as when he had made his advance and she
had rejected it? He had a horror of reopening any discussion
which he regarded as closed; might he not justly say that the
message she had sent through Frenside had been final? She looked
at the unopened envelope and wondered at her courage--or her
folly--in writing to him.</p>

<p>At length she opened the letter, and read the few words
within. In the extremity of her relief she felt weak again, and
had to sit down and cover her face. There was no mention of
lawyers; there was nothing curt or vindictive in the tone of the
letter. Tarrant simply said that he would be glad to see her that
afternoon at his hotel. The sheet trembled in her hand, and she
found herself suddenly weeping.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The porter said that Mr. Tarrant was expecting her, and the
lift carried her up to a velvet-carpeted corridor. It was the
hotel where he and she had stayed whenever they were in Paris
together; the narrow white-panelled corridor was exactly like the
one leading to the rooms they usually had. At its end she was
shown into a stiffly furnished white and gray sitting-room, and
Tarrant stood up from the table at which he had been pretending
to write. He was extremely pale, and catching her own reflection
in the mirror behind him, she thought: "We look like two ghosts
meeting..."</p>

<p>She said: "Lewis," and held her hand out shyly. He touched it
with his cold fingers, and stammered: "You'll have tea?" as
though he had meant to say something more suitable, and had
forgotten what it was.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and he pushed an armchair forward. "Sit
down." She sat down, and for a few moments he stood irresolutely
before her; then he pulled up a chair for himself and reached out
for the cigarettes on the table. "You don't mind?" She shook her
head again.</p>

<p>Suddenly it came over her that this was perhaps the very room
in which, on that unhappy night, Vance had so imprudently pleaded
for her release; and the thought deepened her discouragement. But
she must conquer these tremors and find herself again.</p>

<p>"Thank you for letting me come," she said at length. "I ought
to have thanked you before."</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows with the ironic movement habitual to
him when he wanted to ward off emotional appeals. "Oh,
why--?"</p>

<p>"Because you sent Frenny to me with that offer. And I didn't
thank you properly."</p>

<p>The blood rose under his sensitive skin. "Oh, that, really...I
understood that you...that at the time you were undecided
about your own future..."</p>

<p>"Yes; I was. But I want to tell you that I was very grateful,
though I may not have seemed so; and that now--now I accept."</p>

<p>Tarrant was silent. He had regained control of his features,
but Halo could measure the intensity of the effort, and the
inward perturbation it denoted. After all, he and she had the
same emotional reactions, though his range was so much more
limited; in moments of stress she could read his mind and his
heart as she had never been able to read Vance's. The thought
cast back a derisive light on her youthful illusions.</p>

<p>After the first months of burning intimacy with Vance, and the
harrowing extremes of their subsequent life, Tarrant had become a
mere shadow to her, and she had not foreseen that his presence
would rouse such searching memories. But she was one of the women
on whom successive experiences stamp themselves without effacing
each other; and suddenly, in all her veins and nerves, she felt
that this cold embarrassed man, having once been a part of her
life, could never quite cease to be so. No wonder she had never
been able to adapt herself to the amorous code of Lorry's group!
She sat waiting, her heart weighed down with memories, while
Tarrant considered her last words.</p>

<p>"You accept--?" he repeated at length.</p>

<p>"I--yes. The divorce, I mean...I understand that you..."</p>

<p>"You've decided that you want a divorce?" She nodded.</p>

<p>He sat with bent head, his unlit cigarette between his
fingers. "You're quite certain...now...that this is
really what you wish?"</p>

<p>"I--oh, yes, yes," she stammered.</p>

<p>Tarrant continued in contemplation of her words, and she began
to fear that, after all, he might have let her come only for the
bitter pleasure of refusing what she asked. She had nearly cried
out, appealed to him to shorten her suspense; but she controlled
herself and waited. He got up, and stood before her.</p>

<p>"I ask the question because--if Frenside gave me a correct
account of your talk--you took the opposite view at that time:
you didn't want to take proceedings because you thought that if
you did so Weston might feel obliged to marry you." He brought
out the words with difficulty; she felt sorry for the effort it
was costing him to get through this scene, which she might have
spared him if she had accepted Frenside's intervention. "Are you
positively sure now?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You wish to divorce me in order to marry your lover?"</p>

<p>"Lewis--!"</p>

<p>He smiled faintly. "You object to the word?"</p>

<p>"No; but it seems so useless to go into all this again."</p>

<p>He took no notice, but pursued, in the same level voice: "You
and Weston have come together again, and wish to marry? Is that
it?"</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes, and paused a moment before answering. "I
am not sure--that we shall ever marry. I want my freedom."</p>

<p>"Freedom? Freedom to live without a name, or any one to look
after you? What sort of a life do you propose to lead if you
don't marry him? Have you thought of that?"</p>

<p>She hesitated again. She might have resented his questioning;
but his tone, though cold, was not unkind. And she knew him so
well that she could detect the latent sympathy behind those
measured phrases.</p>

<p>"I haven't thought of the future yet. I only know it seems
best that I should take back my own name."</p>

<p>"If you're not to take his--is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure...about anything. But I want to be
free."</p>

<p>He went and leaned against the mantelshelf, looking down on
her with dubious eyes. "The situation, then, is much the same as
when you saw Frenside; it's only your own attitude that has
changed?"</p>

<p>"Well...yes...I suppose so..."</p>

<p>There was a silence which she measured by the nervous knocking
of her heart. At that moment her knowledge of her husband seemed
of no avail. She could not guess what his secret motive was; but
she felt dimly that something deep within him had been renewed
and transformed, and that it was an unknown Tarrant who
confronted her. He twisted the cigarette incessantly between his
fingers. "I heard you'd been unhappy--" he began abruptly.</p>

<p>She flushed and lifted her head. "No!"</p>

<p>He smiled again. "You wouldn't admit it, I suppose. At any
rate, you're alone--at present. Don't you think that--in the
circumstances--my name is at least a sort of protection?"</p>

<p>The question surprised her so much that she could find no
words to reply; and he hurried on, as if anxious to take
advantage of her silence: "I've no doubt my attitude, all along,
has been misrepresented to you. Perhaps it was partly my own
fault. I'm not good at explaining--especially things that touch
me closely. But for a long time now I've felt that some day you
might be glad to have kept my name...It was my chief reason
for not agreeing to a divorce..." He spoke in the low
indifferent tone which always concealed his moments of deepest
perturbation. "You never thought of that, I suppose?" he ended,
as if reproachfully.</p>

<p>"No--I hadn't."</p>

<p>"H'm," he muttered with a dry laugh. "Well, it doesn't matter.
My pride sometimes gets in my way...particularly when I think
I haven't been fairly treated. But that's all over. I want to
help you..."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lewis, thank you."</p>

<p>"No matter about that. The thing is--look here, can't we talk
together openly?"</p>

<p>She felt her colour rise again; and again her knowledge of him
gave her no clue to what might be coming. "Certainly--it will be
much better."</p>

<p>"Well, then--." He broke off, as if the attempt were more
difficult than he had foreseen. Suddenly he resumed: "If you and
Weston have parted, as I understand you have..." In the
interval that followed she felt that he was waiting for her to
confirm or deny the assertion.</p>

<p>"He went to America ten days ago--to his own people. He felt
that he ought to go and see them. Beyond that we've made no
plans..."</p>

<p>"You mean that there's no understanding between you as to his
coming back--or as to your future relations?"</p>

<p>"I don't wish that there should be! He's free--perfectly free.
That's our only understanding," she exclaimed hastily.</p>

<p>"Well--that's what I wanted to be sure of. If it's that way,
I'm ready to wipe out the past...let it be as if nothing had
happened. It's nobody's business but yours and mine, anyhow...
You understand? I'm ready to take you back."</p>

<p>She sat looking up at him without finding any words; but the
weight in her breast lifted a little--she felt less lonely.
"Thank you, Lewis...thank you..." she managed to say.</p>

<p>His lips narrowed; evidently it was not the response he had
expected. But he went on: "Of course, at first...I can
understand...You might feel that you couldn't come back at
once, take up our life where it broke off--at any rate not in the
old surroundings. I've thought of that; I shouldn't ask it. I
should be ready to travel, if you preferred. For a year--for
longer even. The world's pretty big. We could go to India...
or to East Africa. As far as you like. Explore things...I
don't care what. By the time we got back people would have
forgotten." He straightened himself, as though the last words had
slipped out of a furtive fold of his thoughts. "Not that that
matters. If <i>I</i> choose, nobody else has a word to say. And
nobody will! I--I've missed you, Halo. I ask you to come
back."</p>

<p>She stood silent, oppressed. On Tarrant's lips, she knew, such
an appeal meant complete surrender. If he owned that he had
missed her--<i>how</i> he must have missed her! Under all her
cares and perplexities she felt a little quiver of feminine
triumph, and it trembled in her voice as she answered. "Thank
you, Lewis...for saying that...I wish things could have
been different. Please believe that I do."</p>

<p>She caught the gleam of hope in his eyes. "Well, then--let it
be as if they had been different. Won't you?"</p>

<p>The talk had led them so far from the real object of her visit
that she began to fear for the result. If Tarrant, in refusing to
divorce her, had really had in mind the hope of her return, what
chance was there now of his yielding? It had never been in his
nature to give without taking. She felt bewildered and at a
loss.</p>

<p>"Can things ever be as if they'd never been? Life would be too
easy!" she said timidly.</p>

<p>His face darkened and the nervous frown gathered between his
eyes. "Is that your answer?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be."</p>

<p>"Must be? Not unless you still expect to marry Weston. Is that
it? You owe the truth to me."</p>

<p>She saw instantly that if she said yes her doing so might
provoke a refusal to divorce her; and that if she said no he
would go on insisting, and her final rejection of his offer would
be all the more mortifying to him. She reflected wearily that the
Tarrant she knew was already coming to the surface.</p>

<p>"I've told you the truth; I don't know any more than you do
what my future will be. I'm bound to no one...But if I agreed
to what you suggest, how could we avoid unhappiness? You would
always remember...and the differences in our characters
probably haven't grown less..." She went toward him with
outstretched hands. "Lewis--please! Let me have my freedom, and
let us say goodbye as friends."</p>

<p>Without noticing her gesture he continued to look at her
somberly. "How easily you settle my future for me! Your character
at any rate hasn't changed. Here I've waited for you--waited and
waited for this hour; for I was sure from the first that your
crazy experiment wouldn't last. And now you tell me it's over,
and that your future's not pledged to anybody else--which means
that you're alone in the world, a woman deserted by her lover
(you know as well as I do that that's what people will say). And
yet you continue to let your pride stand between us...or if
it isn't pride, what is it? Some idea that things can't be as
they were before? Well, perhaps they can't--entirely. Perhaps we
can neither of us forget...But if I assure you of my
friendship...my devotion...God, Halo, what I'm proposing
shows how I feel...there's no use talking..."</p>

<p>She caught the cry under his pondered syllables, and saw that
he was struggling with emotions deeper than he had ever known.
The sight woke her pity, and she thought: "Am I worth anything
better than this? Shall I ever be wanted in this way again?"</p>

<p>"Lewis, if you knew how sorry I am! I <i>am</i> grateful--I do
feel your generosity. It's true that I'm alone, and that the
future's rather blank. But all that can't be helped; nothing can
change it now. You must give me my freedom."</p>

<p>"What I feel is nothing to you, then?"</p>

<p>"No. It's a great deal." She looked at him gravely. "It's
because I might end by being tempted that I mustn't listen to
you; that you must let me go."</p>

<p>"Let you go--when you've confessed that you're tempted?
Listen, Halo. You see now how right I was to refuse to divorce
you; to wait; to believe that you'd come back. Now that you're
here, how can you ask me to give you up?"</p>

<p>She stood motionless, her heart trembling with the weight of
his pleading. His words piled themselves up on her like lead.
"How can you, Halo?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Because I'm going to have a child," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh--" he exclaimed. He drew back, and lifted his hands to his
face. Then he turned from her and walked up to the mantelpiece.
He must have caught sight of his own disordered features in the
mirror, for he moved away, and stood in the middle of the room,
livid and silent.</p>

<p>Halo could think of nothing to say. He forced a little laugh.
"I see. And you want a divorce at once, because now you think
he'll have to marry you?"</p>

<p>"I have never thought anything of the sort. I don't want him
to marry me--I don't want him to know what I've told you...I
want to be free and to shift for myself...that's all."</p>

<p>He looked down with knotted brows. "Then this divorce
business--what's your object? If what you tell me is true, I
don't see what you want--or why you should care about a divorce,
one way or the other."</p>

<p>She flushed. "I've no right to give your name to another man's
child. Isn't that reason enough? Can't you understand that a
woman should want to be free, and alone with her child?" she
burst out passionately.</p>

<p>She saw the reflection of her flush in his face. When the
blood rose under his fair skin it burned him to the temples, and
then ebbed at once, leaving him ash-coloured. He moved about the
room vaguely, and then came back to her.</p>

<p>"I had no idea--"</p>

<p>"No; of course. But now you must see..."</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes to hers. "There are women who wouldn't have
been so honest--"</p>

<p>"Are there? I don't know. Please think of what I've asked you,
Lewis."</p>

<p>She saw that he was no longer listening to what she said. All
his faculties were manifestly concentrated on some sudden purpose
that was struggling to impose itself on his will. He spoke again.
"Some women, if only for their child's sake--"</p>

<p>"Would lie? Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well--isn't it perhaps your duty? I mean, to think first of
your child's future? Consider what I've said from that point of
view if you can..."</p>

<p>She returned his gaze with a frightened stare. What was he
hinting at, trying to offer her? Her heart shrank from the
possibility, and then suddenly melted. Lewis--poor Lewis! What
were these depths she had never guessed in him? Had she after all
known him so little? Her eyes filled, and she stood silent.</p>

<p>"Halo--you see, don't you? I...I want you to realize...
to think of it in that way. You'll need help more than ever now.
Halo, why don't you answer? I'd be good to the child," he said
brokenly.</p>

<p>She went up to him and took his hand. It was cold and shook in
her touch. "Thank you for that--most of all. It can't be as you
wish; but I'll never forget. Words are stupid--I don't know what
to say."</p>

<p>"To say--to say? There's nothing to say. The child...the
child would be mine, you understand."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I understand. And I shall always feel
that you're my best friend. But I can't go back to you and be
your wife. You'd be the first to regret it if I did. Don't think
me hard or ungrateful. Only let me go my way."</p>

<p>He turned and rested his elbows on the mantelpiece, and his
head on his clasped hands. She saw that he was struggling to
recover his composure before he spoke again. "Ah, your
pride--your pride!" he broke out bitterly. She was silent, and he
turned back to her with a burst of vehemence. "I suppose, though
you won't acknowledge it even to yourself, you really hope Weston
will come back and marry you when he hears of this?"</p>

<p>"If he hears of it he will certainly offer to marry me. But
for that very reason I don't want him to know--not at present. I
don't want him to feel under any sort of obligation..."</p>

<p>"Has he made you as unhappy as that?"</p>

<p>"Don't we all make each other unhappy, sooner or later--often
without knowing it? I sometimes think I've got beyond happiness
or unhappiness--I don't feel as if I were made for them any more.
I have nothing to complain of--or to regret. But I want to be
alone; to go my own way, without depending on anybody. I want to
be Halo Spear again--that's all."</p>

<p>Tarrant listened with bent head. She saw that he was
bewildered at the depth of his own failure. He had been
prepared--perhaps--to regret his offer; but not to have it
refused. It had never occurred to him that such an extreme of
magnanimity could defeat itself. "Is that really all--all you've
got to say?"</p>

<p>"Since I can't say what you wish, Lewis--what else is
there?"</p>

<p>His white lips twitched. "No; you're right. I suppose there's
nothing." He had grown guarded and noncommittal again; she saw
that to press her point at that moment was impossible. She held
out her hand.</p>

<p>"It's goodbye, then. But as friends--as true friends,
Lewis?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as friends," he echoed rigidly.</p>

<p>He did not seem to notice her extended hand. She saw that he
hardly knew where he was, or what he was doing; but some old
instinct of conformity made him precede her to the door, open it
for her, walk silently at her side down the passage to the
lift.</p>

<p>"I'd rather walk downstairs," she said; but he insisted
gravely: "It's four flights. You'd better wait. In a moment; it
will be here in a moment."</p>

<p>They stood by each other in silence, miles of distance already
between them, while they waited for the preliminary rattle and
rumble from below; then the mirror-lined box shot up, opened its
door, and took her in.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c35">XXXV</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Euphoria "Free Speaker" had expended its biggest
head-lines on the illustrious novelist's return, and Vance, the
morning after his arrival, woke to find himself besieged by
reporters, autograph-collectors, photographers, prominent
citizens and organizers of lecture-tours.</p>

<p>He had forgotten how blinding and deafening America's greeting
to the successful can be, and his first impulse was to fly or to
lie concealed; but he saw that his parents not only took the
besieging of the house for granted, but would have felt there was
something lacking in their son's achievement had it not called
forth this tribute. Even Grandma Scrimser--now rooted to her
armchair by some paralyzing form of rheumatism--shone on him
tenderly and murmured "The college'll have to give him an
honorary degree now," as he jumped up to receive the fiftieth
interviewer, or to answer the hundredth telephone call.</p>

<p>"You remember, darling, that summer way back, when we sat one
day on the porch at Crampton, and you told me you'd had a
revelation of God--a God of your own was the way you put it? A
sort of something in you that stretched out and out, and upward
and upward, and took in all time and all space? I remember it so
well, although my words are not as beautiful as yours. At the
time I was sure it meant you had a call to the ministry. But now,
sitting here and reading in the papers what all the big folks say
about your books, I've begun to wonder if it wasn't your Genius
speaking in you, and maybe spreading its wings to carry you up by
another way to the One God--who is Jesus?" Her great blue eyes,
paler but still so beautiful, filled with the easy tears of the
old as she drew Vance down to her. And after that she advised him
earnestly not to refuse to address his fellow-citizens from the
platform of the new Auditorium Theatre. "They've got a right to
see you and hear you, Vanny; they expect it. It's something you
privileged people owe to the rest of the world. And besides, it's
good business; nothing'll make your books sell better than folks
being able to see what you look like, and go home and say: 'Vance
Weston? Why, sure I know him. I heard him lecture the other day
out at Euphoria. Of course I'm going to buy his new book'. It's
the human touch you see, darling."</p>

<p>The human touch, artfully combined with a regard for the main
chance, still ruled in Mrs. Scrimser's world, and her fading blue
eyes shone with the same blend of other-worldliness and business
astuteness as when she had started on her own successful career
as preacher and reformer. All the family had been brought up in
the same school, without even suspecting that there might be
another; and they ascribed Vance's reluctance to be made a show
of to ill-health and private anxieties.</p>

<p>"It's all that woman's doing. He's worn to a bone, and I can
hardly get him to touch his food," Mrs. Weston grumbled to her
mother; and Vance, chancing to overhear her, knew that the woman
in question was Halo. He understood that his life with Halo was
something to be accounted for and explained away, and that the
pride the family had felt in his prospective marriage ("a Park
Avenue affair", as Mrs. Weston had boasted) increased the
mortification of having to own that it had not taken place. "Some
fuss about a divorce--don't they <i>have</i> divorce in the
Eastern States, anyhow?" she enquired sardonically, as if no lack
of initiative would surprise her in the original Thirteen. The
explanation was certainly unsatisfactory; and sooner than have it
supposed that Vance might have been thrown over, she let slip
that he and the young woman were living together--"society queen
and all the rest of it. Of course she won't let him go..." That
had not been quite satisfactory either. It had arrayed against
him the weightiest section of Mapledale Avenue, and excited in
the other, and more youthful, half, an unwholesome curiosity as
to his private affairs, stimulated by the conviction that the
family were "keeping back" something discreditable, and perhaps
unmentionable; since it was obvious that two people who wanted to
live together had only to legalize their caprice by a trip to
Reno.</p>

<p>All this Vance had learned from his sister Mae during a
midnight talk the day after his arrival. His eldest sister,
Pearl, who was small and plain, and had inherited her mother's
sturdy common-sense, had married well and gone to live at Dakin;
but Mae, who was half-pretty and half-artistic and half-educated,
and had thought herself half engaged to two or three young men
who had not shared her view, had remained at home and grown
disillusioned and censorious. She did not understand Vance any
better than the rest of the family, and he knew it; but the
spirit of opposition caused her to admire in him whatever the
others disapproved of, and for want of an intelligent ear he had
to turn to a merely sympathetic one.</p>

<p>"The Auditorium's sold out already for your reading; and I
know they're crazy to invite you to the Saturday night
dinner-dance at the new Country Club. But some of the old cats
want to know what this is about your living abroad with a married
woman--that Mrs. Dayton Alsop, who was divorced twice before she
caught old Alsop, is one of the worst ones, I guess." Vance
laughed, and said he didn't give a damn for dinner-dances at the
Country Club, and Mae, with sudden bitterness, rejoined: "I
suppose there's nothing out here you do give a damn for, as far
as society goes. But of course if you don't go they'll say it's
because they wouldn't ask you..."</p>

<p>The next day his grandmother seized the opportunity of Mrs.
Weston's morning marketing to ask Vance to come to her room for a
talk; and after the exchange of reminiscences, always so dear to
the old, she put a gentle question about his marriage. He told
her that he didn't believe he was going to get married, and
seeing the pain in those eyes he could never look at with
indifference, he added: "It's all my fault; but you mustn't let
it fret you, because Halo, who's awfully generous, understands
perfectly, and agrees that the experiment has probably lasted
long enough. So that's all there is to it."</p>

<p>"All?" She returned his look anxiously. "It seems to me just a
beginning. A bad beginning, if you like; but so many are. That
don't mean much. I understood the trouble was she couldn't get
her divorce--the husband wouldn't let her. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I suppose she'd have ended by going out to Reno,
though the crowd she was brought up in hate that kind of thing
worse than poison."</p>

<p>"Hate it--why?" Mrs. Scrimser looked surprised. "Isn't it
better than going against God's commandments?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe. But they think out there in New York--Halo's
kind do--that when one of the parties has put himself or herself
in the wrong, they've got no right to lie about it in court, and
Halo would have loathed getting a divorce on the pretext that her
husband had deserted her, when the truth was she'd left him
because she wanted to come and live with me."</p>

<p>This visibly increased Mrs. Scrimser's perplexity, but Vance
saw that her native sense of fairness made her wish to understand
his side of the case.</p>

<p>"Well, I always say it's a pity the young people don't bear
with each other a little longer. I don't think they ought to rush
out and get a divorce the way you'd buy a package of salts of
lemon. It ain't such a universal cure either...But as long as
you and she had decided you couldn't get along without each
other--"</p>

<p>"But now we see we can, so it don't matter," Vance
interrupted. His grandmother gave an incredulous laugh.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child--how can you tell, when you haven't been
married? All the rest's child-play, jokes; the only test is
getting married. It's the daily wear and tear, and the
knowing-it's-got-to-be-made-to-do, that keeps people together;
not making eyes at each other by the moonlight. And when there's
a child to be worried over, and looked after, and sat up nights
with, and money put by for it--oh, then..." Mrs. Scrimser
leaned back with closed eyes and a reminiscent smile. "I'd almost
say it's the worries that make married folks sacred to each
other--and what do you two know of all that?"</p>

<p>Vance's eyes filled. He had a vision of the day when Laura
Lou's mother had entreated him to set her daughter free, when
release had shone before him like a sunrise, and he had turned
from it--why? Perhaps because, as Mrs. Scrimser said, worries
made married folks sacred to each other. He hadn't known then--he
didn't now. He merely felt that, in Laura Lou's case, the
irritating friction of familiarity had made separation
unthinkable, while in regard to himself and Halo, their perpetual
mutual insistence on not being a burden to each other, on
scrupulously respecting each other's freedom, had somehow worn
the tie thin instead of strengthening it. This was certainly the
case as far as he was concerned, and Halo appeared to share his
view. Splendid and generous as she had been when he had come to
her with his unhappy confession, their last weeks at Oubli seemed
to have made it as clear to her as to him that their experiment
had reached its term. It was she who had insisted on his going to
America to see his family and his publishers; she who had
expressly stipulated that they should separate as old friends,
but without any project of reunion. But it was useless to try to
explain this to his grandmother, whose experience had been drawn
from conditions so much more primitive that Halo's fine shades of
sentiment would have been unintelligible to her.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Scrimser laid her hand on his. "Honour bright,
Van--is it another woman?"</p>

<p>He flushed under her gaze. "It's a whole complex of
things--it's me as the Lord made me, I suppose: a bunch of
ill-assorted odds and ends. I couldn't make any woman happy--so
what's the use of worrying about it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Scrimser put her old withered hands on his shoulders and
pushed him back far enough to scrutinize his face. "You young
fool, you--as if being happy was the whole story! It's only the
preface: any woman worth her salt'll tell you that."</p>

<p>He bent over and kissed her. "The trouble is, Gran, I'm not
worth any woman's salt."</p>

<p>She shook her head impatiently. "Don't you go running yourself
down, either. It's the quickest shortcut to losing your
self-respect. And all your fine writing won't help you if you
haven't got that." She stretched out her hand for her spectacles,
and took up the last number of "Zion's Spotlight". "I guess
there'll be an article about you in here next week. They're sure
to send somebody over to hear your talk at the Auditorium," she
called after him proudly as he left the room.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Vance walked slowly down Mapledale Avenue, and through the
centre of the town to the Elkington House. The aspect of Euphoria
had changed almost as much as his father's boasts has led him to
expect. The fabulous development of the Shunts motor industry,
and the consequent growth of the manufacturing suburb at
Crampton, had revived real estate speculation, and the creation
of the new Country Club on the heights across the river was
rapidly turning the surrounding district into a millionaire
suburb. The fashionable, headed by the Shuntses, were already
selling their Mapledale Avenue houses to buy land on the heights;
and a corresponding spread of luxury showed itself in the
development of the shopping district, the erection of the new
Auditorium Theatre, and the cosmopolitan look of cinemas,
garages, and florists' and jewellers' windows. Even the mouldy
old Elkington House had responded by turning part of its ground
floor into a plate-glass-fronted lobby with theatre agency,
tobacconist and newspaper stall. Vance paused to study the
renovated fa&ccedil;ade of the hotel; then he walked up the steps
and passed through the revolving doors. On the threshold a sudden
recoil checked him. Memory had evoked the night when, hurriedly
summoned from the office of the "Free Speaker", he had found
Grandpa Scrimser collapsed under the glaring electrolier of the
old bar, his legs dangling like a marionette's, his conquering
curls flat on his damp forehead. Vance heard the rattle of the
ambulance down the street, and saw the men carrying Grandpa's
limp body across the lobby to the door--and it was hateful to him
that, at this moment, the scene should return with such cruel
precision. It was as if, all those years, Grandpa had kept that
shaft up his ghostly sleeve.</p>

<p>Vance turned to the reception clerk. "Miss Delaney?" he asked,
his voice sounding thick in his throat.</p>

<p>The clerk took the proper time to consider. He was showy but
callow, and a newcomer since Vance's last visit to Euphoria. "I
guess you're Mr. Weston, the novelist?" he queried, his
excitement overcoming his professional dignity. "Why, yes, Miss
Delaney said she was expecting you. Will you step right into the
reception room? You won't be disturbed there. But perhaps first
you'll do me a great favour--? Fact is, I'm a member of the
Mapledale Avenue Autograph Club, and your signature in this
little book..."</p>

<p>Vance's hand shook so that he could hardly form the letters of
his name. He followed the grateful clerk, who insisted on
conducting him in person to a heavily-gilded reception room with
three layers of window curtains and a sultry smell of hot
radiators. "Why, this is where the old bar was!" Vance exclaimed
involuntarily. The reception clerk raised his eyebrows in
surprise. "That must have been a good while ago," he said
disdainfully, as if the new Elkington did not care to be reminded
of the old; and Vance echoed: "Yes--a good while."</p>

<p>He stood absently contemplating the richly-bound volumes of
hotel and railway advertisements on the alabaster centre-table,
the blood so loud in his ears that he did not hear a step behind
him. "Why, Van!" Floss Delaney's voice sounded, and he turned
with a start. "Is it really you?" he stammered, looking at her
like a man in a trance.</p>

<p>"Of course it's me. Do I look like somebody else?"</p>

<p>"No...I only meant...I didn't ever expect to see you
again." He paused, and she stood listening with her faint smile
while his eyes felt their way slowly over her face.</p>

<p>"But didn't you get my note?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I got it. I only landed last week. I meant to stay in
New York and see about my new book--the one that's just out. And
then I saw in the New York papers that you were out here; and so
I came."</p>

<p>She took this halting avowal as if it were her due, but
remained silent, not averted or inattentive but simply waiting,
as her way was, to see what he would say next. He paused too,
finding no words to utter what was struggling in him. "The paper
I saw said you'd come out on business."</p>

<p>Her face took on the eager look it had worn at Brambles when
Alders had called her to the telephone. "Yes, I have. There's a
big deal going on in that new Country Club district; I guess
you've heard about it from your father. I got wind of it last
summer--just after that time you were down in the country with
me, it must have been--and I cabled right home, and bought up all
the land I could. And now I've had two or three big offers, and I
thought I'd better come and look over the ground myself. I've got
the Shunts interests against me; they're trying to buy all the
land that's left, and I stand to make a good thing out of it if I
keep my nerve," she ended, a lovely smile animating her tranquil
lips.</p>

<p>Vance looked at her perplexedly. When he had lit on that
paragraph the day after landing, the idea of seeing her again
swept away every other consideration, and he had thrown over his
New York engagements and hurried out to Euphoria lest he should
get there too late to find her. But on his arrival a note
reassured him; she had gone to Dakin for two or three days with
her lawyer, on some real-estate business, but would soon be back
at the Elkington, where she asked him to call. And there she
stood in her calm beauty, actually smiling about that day at
Brambles, as if to her it were a mere happy midsummer memory, and
she assumed it to be no more to him! Probably the assumption was
genuine; she had forgotten the end of that day, forgotten his
desperate attempts to see her and plead with her in London--as
she had no doubt forgotten the remoter and crueller memories
roused by seeing her again at Euphoria. It was perhaps the
contrast between her statue-like calm and his own inward turmoil
that drew him back to her. There was something exasperating and
yet mysteriously stimulating in the thought that she recalled the
day when she had deserted him at Brambles only because it was
that on which she had first heard of a promising real-estate
deal.</p>

<p>"Do you know what this room is?" he exclaimed with sudden
bitterness. "It's the old bar of the hotel."</p>

<p>She lifted her delicately curved eyebrows. "Oh, is it--? What
of it?" her look seemed to add.</p>

<p>"Yes; and the last time I was here it was in the middle of the
night, when they rang me up at the 'Free Speaker' to say that my
grandfather'd had a stroke. There's where the sofa stood where I
saw him lying." He pointed to a divan of stamped velvet under an
ornate wall-clock.</p>

<p>Her glance followed his. "I don't believe it's the same
sofa--they seem to have done the whole place up," she said
indifferently; and Vance saw from her cloudy brow that she was
annoyed with him for bringing up such memories. "I hate to hear
about people dying," she confessed with a slight laugh; "let's
talk about you, shall we?" But he knew it was herself and her own
affairs that she wanted to discourse upon; and merely to hear her
voice again, and watch the faint curve of her lips as she spoke,
was so necessary to him that he stammered: "No--tell me first
what you've been doing. That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>She gave a little murmur of pleasure and dropped down on the
divan under the clock. Probably she had already forgotten that it
was there that Vance had seen his grandfather lying, as she had
also forgotten, long since, that for her anything painful was
associated with the old man's name. A soft glow of excitement
suffused her. "Well, I have got heaps to tell you--oceans! Why do
you stand off there? Here; come and sit by me...So much seems
to have happened lately, don't it? So you've got a new book
coming out?" She made way for him on the divan, and shrinking a
little at his own thoughts he sat down at her side, her arm
brushing his. "And if I can get ahead of the Shuntses, and pull
this off...See here, Van," she interrupted herself, with a
glance at the jewelled dial at her wrist, "I'm afraid I can't let
you stay much longer now; young Honor&eacute; Shunts, the son of
the one who's trying to buy up the heights, has asked me to run
out with him to the Country Club presently, and of course it's
very important for me to be on good terms with that crowd just
now. You see that, don't you?"</p>

<p>The dizzy drop of his disappointment left Vance silent. "Now,
at once? You're sacking me already?"</p>

<p>"Only for a little while, dear. Everything depends on this
deal. If I can get young Shunts so I can do what I want with him..."
She smiled down mystically on her folded hands.</p>

<p>"Get him to think you're going to marry him, you mean? I
thought you were engaged to Spartivento when I saw you in
London?"</p>

<p>She gathered her brows in the effort to explore those remote
recesses of the past. "Was I, darling? Being engaged don't count
much, anyhow--does it? What I've got to do first is to get this
deal through. Then we'll see. But I'm not going to think about
marrying anybody till then." She looked at her watch again.
"There's somebody coming round from the bank too, with some
papers for me to sign...But couldn't we dine together
somewhere, darling? Isn't there some place where there's a
cabaret, and we could have a good long talk afterward? I'm off to
New York tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow? And of course every minute's filled up with
business till then--" he interrupted bitterly.</p>

<p>"Well, business is what I came for. Anyhow, why can't we dine
together tonight?"</p>

<p>"Because it's just the one night I can't. I'm engaged to give
a lecture at the Auditorium, with readings from my book." Black
gloom filled him as he spoke; but her eyes brightened with
interest. "You are? Why, Van, how splendid! Why didn't you tell
me so before? I've never been inside the Auditorium, have you?
They say it seats two thousand people. Do you think you'll be
able to fill it? But of course you will! Look at the way the
smart set rushed after you in London. And they told me over there
that this new book was going to be a bigger seller than anything
you've done yet. Oh, Van, don't it feel <i>great</i> to come back
here and have everybody crowding round because you're so famous?
Do you suppose there's a seat left--do you think you can get one
for me, darling? Let's go out and ask the ticket-agent right
off--" She was on her feet, alive and radiant as when they had
driven up to Brambles and she had sprung out to plunge her arms
into the lily-pool.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can get you a ticket all right. I'll get you a box if
you like. But you hate readings--why on earth should you want to
come? Besides, what does all that matter? If you're going away
tomorrow, how can I see you again--and when?"</p>

<p>He remembered her talent for eluding her engagements, and was
fiercely resolved to hold her fast to this one. He had something
to say to her--something that he now felt must be said at any
cost, and without delay. After that--. "You must tell me now,
before I go, how I can see you," he insisted.</p>

<p>She drooped her lids a little, and smiled up under them. "Why,
I guess we can manage somehow. Can't you bring me back after the
reading? That would be lovely...I'll wait for you in the lobby
at the Auditorium. I've got my own sitting-room here, and I think
I can fix it up with the reception clerk to have some supper sent
up. He was fearfully excited when I told him who you were." She
looked at him gaily, putting her hands on his shoulders. "I guess
I owe you that after Brambles--don't I, Van?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When he got back to the house, his brain reeling with joy, Mae
pounced out at him with a large silver-gray envelope crested with
gold.</p>

<p>"There! You say you won't fill the Auditorium! And I told you
myself that Mrs. Dayton Alsop was dead against you on account
of--well, the things we talked about the other night. And here's
what it is to be a celebrity! She's invited you to a supper-party
after the reading--she's invited us all. Mother says she won't
go; she's got no clothes, to begin with. And I guess father
won't, if she don't. But I've got my black lace with paillettes.
You won't be ashamed to be seen with me in that, will you, Van? I
never thought I'd see the inside of the Alsop house--did you?"
Her sallow worried face was rejuvenated by excitement and
coquetry.</p>

<p>Vance stood gloomily examining the envelope.
"Supper--tonight?" He thrust the invitation back into her hand.
"Sorry--I can't go. I've got another engagement. You'll have to
coax father to take you."</p>

<p>Mae grew haggard again. "Vance! Another engagement--tonight?
You can't have! Why, the supper's given for you; don't you
understand? Mrs. Dayton Alsop--"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn Mrs. Dayton Alsop!"</p>

<p>His sister's eyes filled. "I think you're crazy, perfectly
crazy...the supper's <i>given for you,"</i> she repeated
plaintively.</p>

<p>"I've told you I'm sorry. I was never told anything about this
supper...I've got another engagement."</p>

<p>Mae looked at him with searching insistence. "You can't have
an engagement with anybody that matters as much as Mrs. Dayton
Alsop. Everybody'll say--"</p>

<p>He burst into an irritated laugh. "Let 'em say what they like!
My engagement happens to matter to me more than a thousand Mrs.
Alsops."</p>

<p>"You say that just to show how you despise us all!" his sister
reproached him.</p>

<p>"Put it on any ground you please. The plain fact is that an
engagement's an engagement. Write and tell her so, will you? Tell
her I'm awfully sorry, but her invitation came too late."</p>

<p>"But she explains that in her letter. She got the party up at
the last minute because she wasn't sure if she could get the
right band. She wanted to make sure of the Dakin Blackbirds. She
always wants the best of everything at her parties...You'll
have to write to her yourself, Vance."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well." He flung away and went up to his room. He
knew that to refuse this invitation would be not only a
discourtesy to Euphoria's ruling hostess but a bitter blow to the
family pride. How could he account to them for his mysterious
midnight engagement? An evasion which would have passed unnoticed
in a big city would be set all Euphoria buzzing. Everybody in the
place would know that no other party was being given that
evening; it would be assumed at once that he was going off on a
drinking bout with some low associates, and the slight to his
hostess and his family would be all the greater. But at that
moment he could not conceive of any inducement or obligation that
could have kept him from meeting Floss after the reading, and
going back to the hotel with her. It was not only his
irresistible longing for her that impelled him. He wanted
something decisive, final, to come out of this encounter. He had
reached a point in his bewildered course when the need to take a
definite step, to see his future shape itself before him in
whatever sense, was almost as strong as his craving for her
nearness. A phrase of his grandmother's: "Nothing counts but
marriage" returned unexpectedly to his mind, and he thought: "It
ought to have been Halo--but that's not to be. And anyhow I'm not
fit for her." With Floss Delaney it would be different. Certain
obscure fibres in both their natures seemed inextricably
entangled. There was a dumb subterranean power in her that
corresponded with his own sense of the forces by which his
inventive faculty was fed. He did not think this out clearly; he
merely felt that something final, irrevocable, must come out of
their meeting that night. He took up his pen, and began: "My dear
Mrs. Alsop--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Three days later, in the New York train, Vance sat trying to
piece together the fragments of his adventure. Everything about
it was still so confused and out of focus that he could only put
his recollections together in broken bits, brooding over each,
and waiting for the missing ones to fit themselves in little by
little, and make a picture.</p>

<p>The theatre: gigantic, opening before him light and glaring as
the Mouth of Hell in a medi&aelig;val fresco he and Halo had seen
in a church somewhere...Rows and rows of faces, all suddenly
individual and familiar, centered on him in their intense
avidity, as if his name were written in huge letters over each of
them...Then, as he settled his papers on the little table in
front of him--in the hush following the endless rounds of
applause which pulled his head forward at rhythmic intervals,
like an invisible wire jerking a marionette--the sudden stir in a
stage box, Mrs. Alsop's box (that heavy over-blown figure was
hers, he supposed, and at her side, slim and amber-warm, Floss
standing up, looking calmly about the house while her dusky furs
slipped from her...)</p>

<p>Yes, it was God's own luck, he saw it now, that before he
could get that cursed letter to Mrs. Alsop written Floss had
summoned him to the telephone (ah, Mae's face as she brought the
message!) to announce peremptorily that she couldn't meet him in
the lobby after the theatre because Mrs. Alsop had invited her to
the party, and she was to go to the theatre in Mrs. Alsop's box,
and young Honor&eacute; Shunts was going with them...and oh,
<i>please,</i> Vance wasn't to make a fuss, and the party
wouldn't last all night, would it, and afterward what was to
prevent--? And wouldn't he be very very sweet, and give her just
one look--the very last--before he began his lecture?...Well,
no, the party wouldn't last all night, he supposed...</p>

<p>And now he was speaking: "Ladies and gentlemen, if anybody had
told me in the old days--" God! What a flat beginning! He didn't
pretend to be a professional speaker...But at last the
preliminaries were over, and he found himself in the middle of
"Colossus." First he read them the fragment about the buried
torso in the desert--the episode which symbolized all that was to
follow...How attentive they were, how hushed! As usual, the
wings of his imagination lifted him above mortal contingencies,
and his voice soared over the outspread silence. But gradually he
began to be conscious of the dense nonconductive quality of that
silence, of the fact that not a word he said traversed its
impenetrable medium. The men were fidgeting in their seats like
children in church; the women were openly consulting their
pocket-mirrors. A programme dropped from the gallery, and every
head was turned to see it fall. Vance could hear his voice
flagging and groping as he hurried on from fragment to
fragment...Which was it now? Ah: the descent to the Mothers, the crux,
the centre of the book. He had put the whole of himself into that
scene--and his self had come out of Euphoria, been conceived and
fashioned there, made of the summer heat on endless wheat-fields,
the frozen winter skies, the bell of the Roman Catholic church
ringing through the stillness, on nights when he couldn't sleep,
after the last trolley-rattle had died out; the plants budding
along the ditches on the way to Crampton, the fiery shade of the
elm-grove down by the river...he had been made out of all
this, had come out of all this, and there, in rows before him,
sat his native protoplasm, and wriggled in its seats, and
twitched at its collar-buttons, and didn't understand him...
And at last it was over, and the theatre rang and rang with the
grateful applause of the released...</p>

<p>And at Mrs. Alsop's, with champagne sparkling and the right
band banging, and flowers and pretty women and white
shirt-fronts, how quickly the boredom was forgotten, the flagging
ardour rekindled, how proud they all were of their home-made
genius, how they admired him and were going to swagger about
him--how the President of the College hinted playfully at an
Honorary Degree, and the pretty women palpitated, and the members
of the Culture Club joked about the bewilderment of the
Philistines: "You've given them something to take home and think
about this time!" And after that everything melted again into a
golden blur of heat and wine and crowding, out of which Floss
Delaney detached herself, firm and vivid, and while Mrs. Alsop's
guests scattered in a sudden snow-fall, and the Dakin Blackbirds
scuttled away with raised coat-collars under the leafless elms,
Vance had found himself in a motor at her side, twisting down the
new road from the heights, crossing the bridge, gliding through
the snow-white streets to the hotel, and descending there at a
mysterious side-door. ("I gave the reception clerk my ticket for
the lecture--and here's his private key," she said with a little
laugh.)</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He had meant to stay at Euphoria for a week or two longer. He
knew the bitter disappointment that his hurried departure was
causing his family, and especially his grandmother and Mae, one
of whom had dreamed of further ovations for the genius, the other
of opportunities to be invited to the new houses on the heights.
But he could not put off seeing Floss again, could not leave the
tormenting ecstasy of their last hours together without a sequel.
Everything drew him on to a dark future shot with wild lightnings
of hope.</p>

<p>Floss had not realized till then what a public figure he was.
The way people had crowded around him at Mrs. Alsop's seemed to
have struck her even more than his popularity in London. She
admitted it herself. "It does feel funny, don't it, Van--you and
I being in the spotlight out here at Euphoria? In Europe it's
different--don't you suppose I know that not one of the big
people over there care a hoot where we come from as long as we
amuse them? If we'd served a term they wouldn't care...But out
here in Euphoria, where they know us inside out, and yet have got
to kotow to us, and get up parties for us, and everybody fighting
to be introduced, and people who've only been here since the boom
pretending they played with us when we were children...Yes, I
guess that 'dough-face', as you call him, who was following me
round everywhere, <i>was</i> young Shunts. Looks as if I'd got
him running, don't it? But he's not half as crazy about me as the
President of the College--did you notice? Oh, Van, I'd love to
make them all feel that way in New York, wouldn't you? And I
guess it would be a lot easier than at Euphoria."</p>

<p>Yes; New York was what she wanted now. And she was sure of it
if only she could pull off her deal, and force the Shuntses to
buy her out at a big figure. If she could get round that young
Shunts, who knew what might happen? At daylight, when they
parted, she made Vance promise with her last kiss to come to New
York as soon as he could. She said she didn't dare try her luck
there without an old friend to back her up; and in a flash of joy
and irony he understood that she was already calculating on the
social value of his young celebrity, on the fact that he could
probably "place" her in New York, get her more quickly into the
inaccessible houses that were the only ones she cared about. "You
will, darling, darling?"...And now he was on his way to keep
his promise.</p>

<p>He remembered thinking, before the reading, that when he met
Floss again that night, something final, irrevocable, must come
of it. He meant to make her understand that this was no mere
lovers' tryst without a morrow, but a turning-point in his life,
a meeting on which his whole future depended. It was as if he
could justify his break with Halo only by creating for himself a
new tie, more binding, more unescapable. He would have felt
ashamed to admit that anything but the need to stabilize his
life, to be in harmony again with himself and his work, could
have forced him to such a step. Halo had seen that, he was sure;
she had understood it. If he was to follow his calling he must be
protected from the sterile agitation of these last years.
Marriage and a home; normal conditions; that was what he craved
and needed. And Floss Delaney seemed to personify the strong
emotional stimulant on which his intellectual life must feed.
Intellectual comradeship between lovers was unattainable; that
was not the service women could render to men. But the old
mysterious bond of blood which seemed to exist between certain
human beings, which youth sought for blindly, and maturity
continued restlessly to crave--that must be the secret soil in
which alone the artist's faculty could ripen. He saw it all now,
looked on it with the wide-open eyes of passion and
disillusionment. A few years ago he would have plunged into the
adventure blindly, craving only the repetition of its dark
raptures. But now it seemed to him that while his senses flamed
his intelligence remained cool. He knew that Floss would always
be what she was--he could no more influence or shape her than he
could bend or shape a marble statue. But he needed her, and
perhaps she needed him, though for reasons so different; and out
of that double need there might come a union so deep-rooted and
instinctive that neither, having once known it, could do without
it. Perhaps that was what his grandmother had in mind when she
said marriage made people sacred to each other. If, after a
life-time with Grandpa Scrimser, she could still believe in the
sanctifying influence of wedlock, then the real unbreakable tie
between bodies and soul must have its origin in depths of which
the average man and woman were hardly conscious, but which the
poet groped for and fed on with all his hungry tentacles.</p>

<p>All this he had meant to make Floss understand--not in the
poet's speech, which would mean nothing to her, but in the plain
words of his passion. He must make her see that they belonged to
each other, that they were necessary to each other, that their
future meetings could not be left to depend on chance or whim. He
meant to plead with her, reason with her, dominate her with the
full strength of his will...And all that had come of it was
that, as her arms slipped from his shoulders, and her last kiss
from his lips, he had promised to follow her to New York.</p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>During the two months since Vance's return to New York
"Colossus" had taken the high seas of publicity, and was now off
full sail on its adventurous voyage. Where would the great craft
land? It had been reviewed from one end of the continent to the
other, and from across the seas other reviews were pouring in.
The first notices, as usual in such cases, were made largely out
of left-over impressions of "The Puritan in Spain"; but a few, in
the literary supplements of the big papers, and in the high-brow
reviews, were serious though somewhat bewildered attempts to
analyze the new book and relate it to the author's previous work,
and in two or three of these articles Vance caught a hint of the
doubt which had so wounded him on Halo's lips. Was this novel,
the critics asked--in spite of the many striking and admirable
qualities they recognized in it--really as original, as personal
as, in their smaller way, its two predecessors had been?
"Instead" and "The Puritan in Spain", those delicate studies of a
vanished society, had an individual note that the more ambitious
"Colossus" lacked...And the author's two striking short
stories--"One Day" and "Unclaimed"--showed that his touch could
be vigorous as well as tender, that his rendering of the present
was as acute and realistic as his evocations of the past were
suffused with poetry...Of this rare combination of qualities
what use had he made in "Colossus"? On this query the critics
hung their reserves and their regrets. The author's notable
beginnings had led them to hope that at last a born novelist had
arisen among the self-conscious little essayists who were trying
to substitute the cold processes of the laboratory for the
lightning art of creation. (The turn of this made Vance wonder if
Frenside had not come back to fiction reviewing.)</p>

<p>It was a pity, they said, that so original a writer had been
influenced by the fashion of the hour (had he then, he wondered,
flushing?) at the very moment when the public, not only the big
uncritical public but the acute and cultivated minority, were
rebelling against these laborious substitutes for the art of
fiction, and turning with recovered appetite to the exquisite
freshness and spontaneity of such books as David Dorr's "Heavenly
Archer", the undoubted triumph of the year. (David Dorr? A new
name to Vance. He sent out instantly for "Heavenly Archer",
rushed through it, and flung it from him with a groan.)</p>

<p>Some books fail slowly, imperceptibly, as though an insidious
disease had undermined them; others plunge from the heights with
a crash, and thus it was with "Colossus ". Halo had been
right--slowly he was beginning to see it. "Colossus" was not his
own book, brain of his brain, flesh of his flesh, as it had
seemed while he was at work on it, but a kind of hybrid monster
made out of the crossing of his own imaginings with those imposed
on him by the literary fashions and influences of the day. He
could have borne the bitterness of this discovery, borne the
adverse criticisms and the uncomfortable evidence of sales
steadily diminishing, as the book, instead of gathering momentum,
flagged and wallowed in the general incomprehension. All that
would have meant nothing but for two facts; first that in his
secret self he had to admit the justice of the more enlightened
strictures, to recognize that his masterpiece, in the making, had
turned into a heavy lifeless production, had literally died on
his hands; and secondly that its failure must inevitably affect
his relations with Floss Delaney. He had always known that she
would measure his achievement only by the material and social
advantages it brought her, and that she wanted only the
successful about her. And he was discovering how soon the green
mould of failure spreads over the bright surface of popularity,
how eagerly the public turns from an idol to which it has to look
up to one exactly on its level. ("'Heavenly Archer'--oh, God!" he
groaned, and kicked the pitiful thing across the floor.)</p>

<p>Had he gone back to his old New York world--to Rebecca Stram's
studio and the cheap restaurants where the young and rebellious
gathered--he might have had a different idea of the impression
produced by his book. These young men, though they had enjoyed
his early ardours and curiosities, had received his first novels
with a shrug; but "Colossus" appealed to them by its very
defects. Like most artistic coteries they preferred a poor work
executed according to their own formula to a good one achieved
without it; and they would probably have championed Vance and his
book against the world if he had shown himself among them. But
there was no hope of meeting Floss Delaney at Rebecca Stram's or
the Cocoanut Tree, and Vance cared only to be where she was, and
among the people she frequented. His return to the New York he
had known when he was on "The Hour" was less of a personal
triumph than he had hoped. In certain houses where he knew that
Floss particularly wanted to be invited he was less known as the
brilliant author of "The Puritan in Spain" than as the obscure
young man with whom Halo Tarrant had run away, to the scandal of
her set; and in groups of more recent growth, where scandals
counted little, celebrity was a shifting attribute, and his
sceptre had already passed to David Dorr.</p>

<p>David Dorr was a charming young man with smooth fair hair and
gentle manners. He told Vance with becoming modesty what an
inspiration the latter's lovely story "Instead" had been to him,
and asked if he mightn't say that he hoped Vance would some day
return to that earlier vein; and none of the strictures on
"Colossus" made Vance half as miserable as this condescending
tribute. "If any of my books are the kind of stuff that fellow
admires--" he groaned inwardly, while he watched Dorr surrounded
by enraptured ladies, and imagined him saying in his offensively
gentle voice: "Oh, but you know you're not fair to Weston--really
not. That first book of his--what was it called?--really did have
something in it..."</p>

<p>But there were moments when the mere fact of being in the same
room with Floss, of watching her enjoyment and the admiration she
excited, was enough to satisfy him. Mrs. Glaisher had reappeared
in New York as a Russian Grand Duchess, with Spartivento and the
assiduous Alders in her train, and Floss, under the grandducal
wing, was beginning to climb the glittering heights of the New
York world, though certain old-fashioned doors were still closed
to her. "I told you it'd be harder to get on here than in London.
They always begin by wanting to know who you are," she complained
one day to Vance. "I guess I'm as good as any of them; but the
only way to make them believe it is to have something, or to be
somebody, that they've got a use for. And I mean to pull that off
too; but it takes time." She had these flashes of dry philosophy,
which reminded Vance of her father's definition of her character.
Mr. Delaney was not in New York with his daughter. He had been
prudently shipped off to Virginia to negotiate for the
re-purchase of one of the Delaney farms. "It'll keep him busy,"
Floss explained--"and out of the way," her tone implied, though
she did not say it. But she added reflectively: "I've told him
I'll buy the place for him if he can get it for a reasonable
price. He'll want somewhere to go when I'm married."</p>

<p>Vance forced a laugh. "When are we going to be married?" he
wanted to ask; but he had just enough sense left to know that the
moment for putting that question had not come. "Have you decided
on the man?" he asked, his heart giving a thump.</p>

<p>She frowned, and shook her head. "Business first. Do you
suppose I'm going to risk having to hang round some day and whine
for alimony? Not me. I've told you already I'll never marry till
I'm independent of everybody. Then I'll begin to think about it."
She looked at him meditatively. "I wish your new novel wasn't so
dreadfully long," she began. "I've tried to read it but I can't.
The Grand Duchess told me people thought it was such a pity you
hadn't done something more like your first books--why didn't you?
As long as you'd found out what people wanted, what was the use
of switching off on something different? You needn't think it's
only because I'm not literary...Gratz Blemer said the other
night he couldn't think what had struck you. He says you could
have been a best-seller as easy as not if you'd only kept on
doing things like 'The Puritan in Spain'. He doesn't think that
Dorr boy's book is in it with your earlier things."</p>

<p>"Oh, doesn't he? That's something to be thankful for," Vance
retorted mockingly.</p>

<p>The renewal of his acquaintance with Gratz Blemer had also
been a disappointment. Vance had always respected Blemer's robust
and patient realism, and his gift of animating and
differentiating the characters of his densely populated works;
Vance recalled the shock he had received when he had first met
the novelist at the Tarrants', and heard him speak of his books
as if they were mere business enterprises. Now, Vance thought,
his greater literary experience might enable him to learn more
from the older man, and to make allowances for his frank
materialism. No one could do work of that quality without some
secret standard of excellence; perhaps Blemer was so sick of
undiscriminating gush that he talked as he did to protect himself
from silly women and sillier disciples, and it would be
interesting to break through his banter and get a glimpse of his
real convictions.</p>

<p>Vance had seen Blemer one night at the Opera, at the back of
his wife's box, and had been struck by the change in his
appearance. He had always been thick-set, but now he was fat and
almost flabby; he hated music (Vance remembered), and sat with
his head against the wall of the box, his eyes closed, his heavy
mouth half open. They met a few nights afterward in a house where
the host was old-fashioned enough to take the men into a
smoking-room after dinner; and here Blemer, of his own accord,
came and sat down by Vance. "Well," he said heavily, "so you've
got a book out."</p>

<p>Vance reddened. "I'm afraid it's no good," he began
nervously.</p>

<p>"Why--isn't it selling?" Blemer asked. Without waiting for an
answer he continued in a querulous tone: "I wish to God I'd
brought my own cigars. I ought to have remembered the kind of
thing they give you in this house." He waved a fat contemptuous
hand toward the gold-belted rows in their shining inlaid cabinet.
"The main thing is to get square with the reviewers first," he
continued wearily. "And generally by the time a fellow's enough
authority to do that, he doesn't give a damn what they say."</p>

<p>"I don't think I've ever cared," Vance flashed out.</p>

<p>Blemer drew his thick lids together. "You don't think they
affect sales, one way or the other? Well, that's one view--"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that. I only care for what I myself think of my
work." As he spoke, Vance believed this to be true. But Blemer's
attention had already wandered back to himself. "I wish I could
get away somewhere. I hate this New York business--dinners and
dinners--a season that lasts five months! I'd like to go up the
Nile--clear away to Abyssinia. Or winter sports--ever tried 'em?
Of course the Engadine's the only place...Write better there?"
he interrupted himself, replying to a question of Vance's. He
gave a little grumbling laugh. "Why, I can't write anywhere any
more. Not a page or a line. That's the trouble with me." He
laughed again. "Not that it matters much, as far as the shekels
go. I guess my old age is provided for...Only--God, the days
are long! Well, I suppose they're waiting for us to begin
bridge." He got up with a nod to Vance. "I wish I was young
enough to read your book--but I hear it's eight hundred pages,"
he said as he lumbered back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As the weeks passed Vance became aware that he was no nearer
the object for which he had come to New York. He continued to
meet Floss Delaney frequently, and in public she seemed as glad
as ever to see him. But on the rare occasions when he contrived
to be alone with her she was often absent-minded, and sometimes
impatient of his attempts at tenderness. After all, she
explained, he was the only old friend she had in New York, and it
did seem hard if she couldn't be natural with him, and not bother
about how she looked or what she said. This gave him a momentary
sense of advantage, and made him try to be calm and reasonable;
but he knew he was only one in the throng of young men about her,
and not even among the most favoured. At first she had made great
play of the fact that he and she came from the same place, and
had romped together as children (a vision of their early intimacy
that he was himself beginning to believe); but she presumably
found this boast less effective than she had hoped, for though
she continued to treat him with sisterly freedom he saw that she
was on the verge of being bored by his importunities, and in his
dread of a rebuff he joined in her laugh against himself.</p>

<p>For a time she talked incessantly about the Euphoria deal, and
boasted of her determination to outwit the Shuntses and make them
buy her out at her own price. Though Vance had grown up in an
atmosphere of real-estate deals the terminology of business was
always confusing to him, but he saw that she was trying to gain
her end by captivating young Shunts; they were even reported to
be engaged, though the fact was kept secret owing to the
opposition of the young man's family. But Vance bore with this
too, knowing that, even if the rumour were true, she was not
likely to regard a secret engagement as binding, and trying to
believe that in the long run he was sure to cut out so poor a
creature as young Shunts. Of late she had ceased to speak about
Euphoria, and had even (judging from the youth's lovelorn
countenance) lost interest in Shunts; and this strengthened
Vance's hope. She had said she would never marry till she had
secured her independence; but once that was done, why should she
not marry him sooner than one of the other men who were hanging
about her?</p>

<p>He had always instinctively avoided the street in which the
Tarrants used to live. He did not know if Tarrant still occupied
the same flat, or even if he were in New York. He seemed to have
vanished from the worldly circles which Vance frequented, and the
latter had not even heard his name mentioned. "The Hour", he
knew, had changed hands, and under a more efficient management
had kept just a touch of "highbrow", skilfully combined with a
popular appeal to cinema and sartorial interests. All this part
of Vance's life had fallen in ruins, and he wished he had not
been so haunted by the fear of stumbling upon them; but his
visual associations were so acute that he had to go out of his
way to avoid the sight of that tall fa&ccedil;ade with the
swinging glass doors and panelled stone vestibule that used to be
the way to bliss. One night, however, returning from a dinner
where Floss had promised to meet him, and had failed to come, he
was driven along on such a tide of resentment and bitterness
that, without knowing where he was, he turned a corner and found
himself before the Tarrant door. He was on the farther side of
the street, and looking up he saw a light in the high window of
the library. It gave him a sharp twist, and he was standing
motionless, without strength to turn away, when the doors swung
open and George Frenside's short clumsy figure issued from
between the plate-glass valves. Frenside paused, as if looking
for a taxi; then he crossed to Vance's side of the street, and
the two men suddenly faced each other under a lamp. Vance noticed
Frenside's start of surprise, and the backward jerk of his lame
body; but a moment later he held out his hand. "Ah, Weston--I
heard you were in New York."</p>

<p>Vance looked at him hesitatingly. "I'm going home soon--to my
own home, at Euphoria," he explained. "I've got to be alone and
write," he added, without knowing why.</p>

<p>He saw the ironic lift of Frenside's shaggy brows. "Already?
You've brought out a magnum opus just lately, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But it's not what I wanted it to be."</p>

<p>"No," said Frenside bluntly. "I didn't suppose it was."</p>

<p>"So he's read it!" Vance thought, with a sudden flush of
excitement; but Frenside's tone did not encourage further
discussion. Both men stood silent, as if oppressed by each
other's presence; but just as Frenside was turning away with a
gesture of farewell, Vance brought out precipitately: "I suppose
you see Halo's people. Can you tell me how she is?"</p>

<p>Frenside's face seemed to grow harsher and more guarded.
"Quite well, I believe."</p>

<p>"She...I haven't heard lately...She's not here...is
she?"</p>

<p>"In New York? Not that I'm aware of." Frenside hesitated and
then said hurriedly: "If there's any message--"</p>

<p>Vance felt the blood rush to his forehead and then ebb. His
heart shook against his breast. "Thank you...yes...I'll
ask you..."</p>

<p>The two men nodded to each other and separated.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Vance walked away with his thoughts in a turmoil. The meeting
with Frenside had stirred up deep layers of sleeping
associations. It was only three months since he had said goodbye
to Halo in Paris, but the violent emotional life he had plunged
into after their parting made those days seem infinitely distant.
Gradually, almost unconsciously, his memories of Halo had taken
on the mournful serenity of death; they lay in the depths of his
consciousness, with closed lips and folded hands, as though to
say that they would never trouble him again. But his few words
with Frenside, and the mere speaking of Halo's name to some one
who had perhaps been with her or heard from her lately, disturbed
the calm of these memories, and brought Halo back to him as a
living suffering creature. Yes--suffering, he knew; and by his
fault. For months he had been trying to shut his eyes and ears to
that fact, as sometimes, in camp as a boy, when he heard a
trapped animal crying at night far off in the woods, he would
bury his head under the blankets and try to think the wail had
ceased because he had closed his ears against it...Ah, well,
no use going back to all that now. It was over and done, and he
must hide his head again, and try to make himself believe the
sound had ceased because he did not want to hear it...</p>

<p>Why had Floss not come to the dinner? His hostess, visibly
annoyed, said she had called up at the last moment, excusing
herself on the plea of a cold; but Vance suspected her of having
found something more amusing to do--where, and with whom? The
serpent-doubts reared their heads again, hissing in his ears;
even if he had tried to listen for that other faint cry they
would have drowned it. A cold? He didn't believe it for a
minute...But it would be a pretext for calling at her hotel to ask.
The hour was not late, and he would go straight to her
sitting-room, without sending his name up first. Very likely she
would not be there; almost certainly not. But he would leave a
note for her and then go away...It seemed to him that even if
she were out (as he was certain she would be) it would quiet him
to sit in her room for a little while, among the things that
belonged to her and had her scent.</p>

<p>The lift shot him up, and in answer to his knock he was
surprised to hear her voice call out: "Come in." She lay curled
up on a lounge, in a soft velvet wrapper, her hair tossed back,
her feet, in gossamer stockings and heelless sandals, peeping out
under a Spanish shawl. The room looked untidy yet unlived in: her
fur cloak, a withered cluster of orchids pinned to it, had been
flung across the piano beside an unwatered and half-dead azalea
from which the donor's card still dangled; and on a gilt table
stood an open box of biscuits, some dried-up sandwiches and an
empty cup. Perhaps it was the fact that he had been thinking of
Halo that made the scene seem so squalid in its luxury. Floss had
none of Halo Tarrant's gift for making a room seem a part of
herself--unless indeed this cold disorder did reflect something
akin to itself in her own character.</p>

<p>She smiled up at Vance through rings of smoke; but she seemed
too lost in her musings to be either surprised, or otherwise
affected, by his appearance. "Hullo, Van," she greeted him in a
happy purr.</p>

<p>"All that smoke's not the best thing for your throat, is it?"
he said, bending over her; and she answered: "Throat? What's the
matter with my throat?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stratton said you'd telephoned you couldn't dine with
her because you had a cold--"</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure--it was the Stratton dinner tonight." She gave
a little laugh. "How was it? Who was there? Did I miss
anything?"</p>

<p>"What were you doing instead?" he retorted; and she pointed
toward an armchair at her elbow. "Oh, boy--sit down and I'll tell
you." She tossed away her cigarette, and crossing her arms behind
her, sank her head into the nest they made, and lay brooding, a
faint tremor on lips and eyelids. Vance looked at her as if he
were looking for the first time; there was a veiled radiance in
her face which he had seen in it only once or twice, in moments
of passionate surrender. "Van," she said slowly, as though the
words were so sweet that she could hardly part with them, "Van,
I've pulled it off. The cheque's locked up in my bank. The
Shuntses have bought me out at my own price--I knew they would. I
didn't knock off a single dollar." She laughed again and waited,
as if for the approval which was her due.</p>

<p>Vance stood looking at her, his heart in a tumult. If she were
free, if she were independent, as she called it, perhaps his
moment had come! He moved forward to snatch her to him, to
entreat, reason, smother her replies against his heart--but
something checked him, warned him it was not yet the moment. She
wanted to go on talking about herself and her triumph, and if he
thwarted her with his clumsy declaration his last chance might be
lost.</p>

<p>He dropped back into the armchair. "Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>The smile lingered softly on her lips. "Oh, darling, what a
fight it's been! I'm half dead with it. That poor boy's only just
left. I did feel sorry for him--I couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"What poor boy?" Van echoed, his tongue feeling dry in his
throat. But he knew the answer before she made it.</p>

<p>"Why, Honor&eacute; Shunts, of course. That's why I had to
throw over the Stratton dinner. I had to go out and dine with
him--and then he came back here. He wouldn't listen to reason;
but he had to. I never saw anybody cry so. I told him I couldn't
stand it--it was unmanly of him, don't you think it was? And I
couldn't keep his letters, could I, when the family were so set
on getting them away from me? I thought I'd never make him
understand...But now I guess I can take a holiday." She sank
more deeply into her cushions, her lids drooping, her lips
slightly parted, as though with the first breathings of sleep.
"I'm dead tired, dead..."</p>

<p>Vance sat with his eyes fixed on her. Every word she spoke
burned itself slowly into his consciousness. He wanted to cry
out, to question her--to fling his indignation and horror into
her face. It was all as clear as day. She had held the socially
ambitious Shuntses through the boy's letters; she had forced them
to buy up her land at her own price through their dread lest the
heir to their millions should marry her. By this simple expedient
she had attained fortune and liberty at a stroke--there had been
nothing difficult about it but the boy's crying. She had thought
that unmanly; an obvious warning to Vance not to repeat the same
mistake. Floss always liked the people about her to be cheerful;
he knew that. And after all perhaps she was right. Was a poor
half-wit like young Shunts worth wasting a pang over? Yes; but
the boy had cried--that was the worst of it. Vance seemed to feel
those tears in his own throat; it was so thick with them that he
could hardly bring out his next question. "Didn't you hate the
job--seeing that poor devil all broken up, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Of course I hated it. I've told you I did. It was horrid of
him, not being willing to see how I was placed. But he's just a
spoilt baby, and I told him so."</p>

<p>"Ah--you told him so." He stood looking down on her, remarking
for the first time that her cheek-bones were a little too high,
that they gave her a drawn and grimacing look he had never before
noticed. He thought: "This is the way she talked about me to the
fellow who kept her at Dakin." For he no longer believed in the
legend of her having gone to Dakin to get a job in a dry-goods
store. He felt his strength go from him, and Honor&eacute;
Shunts's tears under his lids. She was not really like that--he
couldn't endure the thought that she was like that. She must
instantly say something, do something to disprove it, to drag him
up out of the black nightmare of his contempt for her.</p>

<p>He flung himself down beside the lounge. "Floss, you're
joking, aren't you, about those letters?"</p>

<p>"What do you call joking? As long as the family wanted them
back, what was I to do with them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, God--not that. Not that! You must see...I suppose I
haven't understood...You can't mean you've used his letters
that way...not that?"</p>

<p>She lay looking up at him, half-amused, half-ironic; but as
she saw the change in his face her own grew suddenly blank and
cold. "I don't know what you mean by using them. It wasn't my
fault if he wrote them; you wouldn't have had me keep them, would
you, when his people wanted them so badly? I did my duty, that's
all. It isn't always a pleasant job--and you men don't generally
make it easier for us."</p>

<p>He hardly distinguished the words; her voice poured over him
like an icy flood. It seemed as if he and she were drowning in it
together. "Dearest, you're not like that, you're not like that,
say you're not like that," he besought her blindly.</p>

<p>She gave a slight laugh and drew back from his imploring arms.
"I'm dead tired; I've told you so before. I like people who can
take a hint; don't you, darling?" She sat up and stretched out
her hand for a cigarette. "Look here--you needn't look so cross,"
she said. "I'm not throwing you out for good. You can come back
tomorrow, if you'll try to treat me a little more politely. But
I'm rather fed up with scenes just now, and I'm going to tumble
straight into bed. So long, dear."</p>

<p>She reached for her cigarette-lighter and he heard its dry
snap as he got to his feet and turned away from her.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c38">XXXVIII</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>On the table in his room, when he re-entered it that night, he
saw a telegram; but he left it lying. Whoever it was from,
whatever it contained, could hardly matter at that moment. He
dropped into a chair and sat staring ahead of him down a long
tunnel of darkness. Nothing mattered--nothing would ever again
matter. He felt like a man who has tried to hang himself because
life was too hideous to be faced, and has been cut down by
benevolent hands--and left to face it. He thought of the day when
he had staggered into his parents' room at Euphoria to find his
father's revolver and make an end--and the revolver had not been
there, and he had been thrown back on life as he was thrown back
on it now. He felt again the weakness of his legs, the blur in
his sick brain, as he staggered down the passage from one room to
the other, groped about among the familiar furniture like a thief
in a strange house, found the drawer empty, and crawled back
again to his own room. It was dreadful, the way old memories of
pain fed their parasitic growth on new ones, and dead agonies
woke and grew rosy when the Furies called...</p>

<p>The winter daylight came in at the window before he thought of
the telegram again. Then something struck him about the way it
lay there, alone, insistent, in the smoky dawn, and he reached
out and tore it open. The message was from his sister Mae and
read: "Grandma has pneumonia wants you badly come as soon as you
can."</p>

<p>In the train that was hurrying him homeward it occurred to him
for the first time that the telegram might have been from Halo.
He wondered why that possibility had never presented itself to
his mind before; but in the moral wreckage of the last hours he
had not seen her struggling and sinking. She seemed to be hidden
away in some safe shelter, like the Homeric people when a cloud
hides them from mortal peril. But now the thought of her stole
back, he felt her presence in his distracted soul. He seemed to
lie watching her between closed lids, as a man on a sick bed
watches the gliding movements of his nurse, and weaves them into
the play of light on the ceiling...</p>

<p>At the door of the Mapledale Avenue house, where Mae and his
father met him, some one said: "She's conscious...she'll know
you..." and some one added: "You'd better come into the
dining-room and have some coffee first--or did you get it on the
train?"</p>

<p>On the landing upstairs he met his mother. Mrs. Weston was a
desiccated frightened figure. They were not used to death at the
Westons', it did not seem to belong to the general plan of life
at Euphoria, it had no language, no ritual, no softening
conventions to envelop it. Mrs. Weston's grief was dry and
stammering. "The minister's been with her, but he's gone away.
She says she won't see anybody now but you," she whispered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scrimser's room was full of crisp winter sunlight and its
brightness lay across her bed. She sat up against her smooth
pillows, small but sublime. All her great billowing expanse of
flesh seemed to have contracted and solidified, as though
everything about her that had roamed and reached out was gathered
close for the narrow passage. She was probably the only person in
the house who knew anything about death, and Vance felt that she
had already come to an understanding with it. He knelt down and
pressed his face against the bed. "Van," she said, "my little
boy..." Her fingers wandered feebly through his hair. He
remembered that only two nights before he had been kneeling in
the same way, his arms stretched out to snatch at another life
that was slipping from him, not into death but into something
darker and more final; and that other scene lost its tragic
significance, became merely pitiful and trivial. He put away the
memory, pressing his lips to the wise old hands, trying to
exclude from his mind everything but what his grandmother had
been, and still was to him. For a long time they held each other
in silence; then she spoke softly. "I've been with you so often
lately. At Crampton, on the porch..."</p>

<p>Yes; to him too those hours were still living. In some ways
she had been nearer to him than any one else, though he knew it
only as their souls met for goodbye. He buried his face in those
tender searching hands, feeling the warm current of old memories
pass from her body to his, as if it were she who, in some
mystical blood-transfusion, was calling him back to life. A door
opened, and some one looked in and stole away. The clock ticked
quietly. She lay still. "Van," she said after a while, in a
weaker voice. He lifted his head. "There's something I wanted to
say to you. Stoop over, darling." He stood up and bent down so
that his ear was close to her lips. "Maybe we haven't made enough
of pain--been too afraid of it. Don't be afraid of it," she
whispered.</p>

<p>Apparently it was her final message, for after that she lay
back, quiet and smiling, and though he knew she was conscious of
his presence the only sign she gave him was, now and then, the
hardly audible murmur of his name. Gradually he became aware that
even he was growing remote to her. She began to move in the bed
uneasily, with the automatic agitation of the dying, and he rose
to call his mother. He noticed then that his aunt Sadie Toler had
crept in, and was sitting, a dishevelled stricken figure, in a
corner waiting. She came to her mother.</p>

<p>When Vance returned to his grandmother's room, twilight had
fallen and the room was quieter than ever. But now a short
convulsive breathing seemed struggling to keep time with the tick
of the clock. Some one whispered: "Oxygen"; some one else stole
out and came back with a heavy bag. The doctor came, and Vance
wandered out of the room again. He joined his father, and the two
men sat, aimless and vacant-minded, in Mrs. Weston's bedroom
across the passage. Mr. Weston said with a nervous laugh: "That
was a big turnover those Delaneys made the other day--" but Vance
was silent. His father drummed on the table, stealthily drew a
cigar from his pocket, fixed on it a look of longing, and put it
back. "You'd better go and lie down on the bed and try and have a
nap," he suggested to his son. To cut short the talk Vance
obeyed, and almost immediately fell into a black pit of sleep. He
seemed to have lain plunged in it for hours when he was roused by
steps in the room and the flash of electric light in his eyes.
Mae stood before him. "Do you want to see her?"</p>

<p>"See her? Has she asked for me--?" But before the phrase was
ended he understood, and as he stumbled to his feet he remembered
the agony it had been to go into Laura Lou's room after she was
dead, and look down on the smooth empty shell which some clever
craftsman seemed to have made and put there in her place. "No,
no!" he cried, and threw himself back on the bed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Vance sat in the Mapledale Avenue dining-room the day after
his grandmother's funeral. For a while he had been separated from
her by the long-drawn horror of the burial service, with its
throng of mourners gathered from every field of her beneficence,
the white-haired orators pressing on the <i>vox humana,</i> the
bright eye-glassed women stressing uplift and service, and the
wrong it would do their leader's memory to think of her as dead
and not passed over, the readings from Isaiah and James Whitcomb
Riley, intermingled by a practised hand.</p>

<p>Now the house was silent and deserted, and she could come to
him again. The strange people who assemble at the call of death
had vanished, the neighbours had called and gone away, the women
were upstairs, busy with their mourning, and Lorin Weston had
gone back to the office. He had wanted Vance to go with him, had
suggested their running over in the Ford to see the land the
Shuntses had just bought from Floss Delaney; he had evidently
been a little hurt at his son's declining to accompany him.</p>

<p>After Mr. Weston had left the house Vance sat alone and stared
into his future. He could not stay another day at Euphoria; too
many memories, bitter or sorrowful, started up from every corner
of that featureless place. But where should he go, how deal with
the days to come? All thought of returning to New York had
vanished. Those hours in his grandmother's room seemed to have
washed his soul of its evil accretions. He felt no heroic
inspiration to take up life again, but only a boundless need to
deal with himself, cut a way through the jungle of his
conflicting purposes, work out some sort of plan from the dark
muddle of things. "Pain--perhaps we haven't made enough of it."
Those last words of his grandmother's might turn out to be the
clue to his labyrinth. He didn't want to expiate--didn't as yet
much believe in the possibility or the usefulness of it; he
wanted first of all to measure himself with his pain, to wrestle
alone with the dark angel and see how he came out of that
conflict.</p>

<p>It was Mae who came to his rescue. He told her he wanted to
get away from everything and everybody, and try to do some
work--though at the moment he didn't believe he would ever write
another line. Mae was impressed, as he intended she should be, by
the urgent call of his genius, and immediately exclaimed: "That
Camp of Hope up at Lake Belair always has somebody to look after
it in winter. I guess they'd take you in up there."</p>

<p>The solitude of the northern woods in winter! A wild longing
to be there at once possessed him. But he wanted to make sure
that there were no hotels near by, no winter sports, nothing but
stark woods and frozen waters. Mae knew the man who lived there,
and could reassure him. He was a poor fellow who, having
developed tuberculosis, had had to give up his career as a
school-teacher and accept this care-taker's job for the sake of
the air and the out-door life. He had been cured, and might have
gone back to his work; but he had turned into a sort of hermit,
and would only take a summer class in natural history at the
camp, returning to his frozen solitude in winter. Mae proposed to
telegraph to find out if he would receive Vance as a boarder, or
make some other arrangement for him, and Vance accepted.</p>

<p>Two days later he was on his way to Lake Belair. After a day's
journey the train left him at dusk at a wayside station, and as
he got out the icy air caught him by the throat and then suddenly
swung him up on wings. He heard sleigh-bells approaching in the
dark, and a few minutes later the cutter was gliding off with him
into the unknown.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c39">XXXIX</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The ex-schoolmaster, Aaron Brail, a thin slow man of halting
speech, seemed neither surprised nor unduly interested by Vance's
coming. He explained that he sometimes took a boarder in winter
to replenish his scanty funds, and said he hoped Vance wouldn't
be dissatisfied with the food, which was supplied by the wife of
one of the lumbermen from the near-by camp. Vance was given a
small bare room with a window looking out on vastnesses of snow
and hemlock forest, and Brail and he seldom met except at meals,
and when they smoked their pipes after supper about the
living-room stove. There was a rough book-shelf against the wall,
with a row of third-rate books on various subjects, chiefly
religion and natural history. Brail was a half-educated
naturalist, and spent his evenings making laborious excerpts from
the books he was reading. He was too shortsighted to be a good
field-observer, and his memory was so uncertain that when he was
not mislaying the notes he had made the night before he was
hunting for the spectacles without which he could not re-read
them. But though he was not interesting the solitude of his life
in that austere setting of hills and forests had given him a kind
of primitive dignity, and his company was not uncongenial.</p>

<p>Every morning early Vance started off on a tramp of
exploration with one of the lumbermen, but he soon dispensed with
his guide, and spent the white-and-gold hours in long lonely
rambles. Sometimes he would pick up a meal in a lumberman's
house, but oftener he carried his provisions with him and ate
them on a warm ledge in the sun. The hours flowed by with the
steady beat of the sea--there were days when he almost imagined
himself lying again on the winter sands and watching the
shoreward march of the waves, as he had done during his honeymoon
with Laura Lou. His mind travelled back to his first adventures
and discoveries, which already seemed so remote; he felt like a
very old man whose memory, blurring the intervening years,
illuminates the smallest incidents of youth. Sometimes he came
home so drunk with sunlight and cold that sleep struck him down
in the doorway, and he would throw himself on his hard bed and
not wake till Brail called him to supper.</p>

<p>At first he paid for these bouts of sleep by lying awake all
night, his brain whirling and buzzing like a gigantic loom. It
was as though he were watching some obscure creative process, the
whirl and buzz of the cosmic wheels. The fatigue was maddening,
and when sleep finally came there was no rest in his brief
unconsciousness. Two women peopled these agitated vigils; the one
that his soul rejected and his body yearned for, the other who
had once seemed the answer to all he asked of life, but had now
faded to a reproach and a torment. The whole question of woman
was the agelong obstacle to peace of spirit and fruitfulness of
mind; to get altogether away from it, contrive a sane and
productive life without it, became the obsession of his sleepless
midnights. All he wanted was to be himself, solely and totally
himself, not tangled up in the old deadly nets of passion and
emotion.</p>

<p>But solitude and hard exercise gradually worked their spell.
His phases of excited insomnia gave place to a quiet wakefulness,
and he would lie and watch the night skies wheel past his
unshuttered window, and recover again his old sense of the
rhythmic beat of the universe. The feeling brought a kind of
wintry quietude, a laying on of heavenly hands, and he would fall
asleep like a child who knows that his nurse is near.</p>

<p>On stormy days he lingered in the lumbermen's huts, talking
with them and their families, and he felt refreshed by the
contact with their simple monotonous lives. But they lived
unconsciously in those cosmic hands in which he felt himself
cradled, and as vigour of mind and body returned he began to
crave for a conscious intelligence, an intelligence not
complicated or sophisticated but moulded on the large quiet lines
of the landscape. He tried to think that Brail might satisfy this
need; but Brail was not so much uncommunicative as lacking in
anything to communicate. He was not hostile to Vance, he seemed
even, as the weeks passed, to find a mild pleasure in their
evening talks. But he had a small slack mind, to which his
rudimentary studies as a naturalist had given no precision; and
Vance suspected that his flight to the woods had been not toward
something but away from something. It was the same with Vance
himself: but as his nerves grew steadier he understood that he
would never be able to rest long in evasion or refusal, that
something precise and productive must come out of each step in
his life. He began to think of himself less as a small
unsatisfied individual than as an instrument in some mighty hand;
and one day he was seized by the desire to put this rush of
returning energy into words. On starting for the woods he had
snatched up a few old books left at Euphoria since his college
days--an Odyssey and a Greek grammar among them--and during his
sleepless nights he had laboured over the grammar and refreshed
his spirit with glimpses of the sunlit Homeric world, which was
spacious and simple like the scenes about him. But with the
revival of the desire to write his studies slackened, and the
books lay untouched, with two others which Mae had taken from the
shelf by his grandmother's bed, and handed to him as he was
leaving. These he had not even looked into--the mood for books
had passed. He must write, write, write. But to his dismay he
found he had brought no paper with him. This would have been a
small misfortune at a season when the general store was open and
the mails came regularly; but a succession of snowstorms had
interrupted the postal service from the nearest point on the
railway, and nobody at the camp had any paper. Even Brail could
produce only a few sheets of letter-paper, and this absurd
obstacle aggravated Vance's fury to begin. At length he coaxed
some torn sheets of packing paper from one of the lumbermen's
wives, and set himself to work. The fact of having only these
coarse crumpled pages at his disposal seemed to stimulate his
imagination, and in those first days he felt nearer than ever
before to the hidden sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>The return to work steadied his nerves, and his tramps over
the frozen hills carried him back into that world of ecstasy from
which he had been so long shut out. He had written "Colossus" in
a fever, but his new book was shaping itself in a mood of deep
spiritual ardour such as his restless intelligence had never
before attained, and these weeks outside of time gave him his
first understanding of the magic power of continuity.</p>

<p>Now that his energies were all engaged he could let his
thoughts return to his grandmother's death. At first that misery,
so meaningless in its suddenness, had been unendurable; but now
he could think about her calmly, recognizing that her course was
run and that she would not have wished to outlive herself. In her
way she had been happy, in spite of ups and downs of fortune, in
spite of Grandpa Scrimser, and of blows (not infrequent, he
suspected) to her pride as an orator and evangelist. She was too
intelligent not to be aware of her own ignorance, too impulsive
to remember it for long; but he felt that all these
contradictions were somehow merged in a deep central peace. Vance
had always ascribed this to the optimism he found so irritating
in her; but her last word had been a warning against optimism.
"Maybe we haven't made enough of pain--" that had been her final
discovery, and it completed his image of her.</p>

<p>One evening, as he brooded over these memories, feeling the
warmth of her soul in his, he remembered the two books that Mae
had brought him as he was leaving Euphoria. They stood on his
table with the others, and he took them up and glanced at them.
One was a thumbed anthology of "Daily Pearls", collected by the
editor of "Zion's Spotlight"; the kind of book from which pressed
pansies and scraps of pious verse drop in a shower when they are
opened. The other volume had obviously been less often consulted.
Vance opened it and slowly turned the pages. In a few minutes
they had possession of him, and he read on deep into the night,
read till his oil-lamp had sputtered out and his candle followed
it; and when sunrise came he was sitting up in bed in his old
leather coat, still reading. "The Confessions of Saint
Augustine"--though the title was familiar the book had never come
his way, and he had only a vague idea of its date and origin. But
before he had read a dozen pages he saw that it was one of the
timeless books with which chronology is unconcerned. Who was this
man who reached out across the centuries to speak to him as never
man had spoken before? He felt his whole life summed up in each
of these piercing phrases. "Come, Lord, and work: arouse us and
incite; kindle us, sweep us onward; teach us to love and to run...</p>

<p>"I said: 'Give me chastity and self-control--<i>but not just
yet</i>...' I was shaken with a gust of indignation because I
could not enter into Thy Will, yet all my bones were crying out
that this was the way, and no ship is needed for that way, nor
chariot, no, nor feet; for it is not as far from me as from the
house to the spot where we are seated...</p>

<p>"And Thou didst beat back my weak sight, dazzling me with Thy
splendour, and I perceived that I was far from Thee, in the land
of unlikeness, and I heard Thy voice crying to me: 'I am the Food
of the full-grown. Become a man and thou shalt feed on Me'."</p>

<p>The food of the full-grown--of the full-grown! That was the
key to his grandmother's last words. "Become a man and thou shalt
feed on Me" was the message of experience to the soul; and what
was youth but the Land of Unlikeness?</p>

<p>Night after night he returned to those inexhaustible pages,
again and again after that first passionate encounter he re-read
them slowly, broodingly, weighing them phrase by phrase in the
light of his brief experience, feeling his soul expand to receive
them, and carrying away each day some fragment of concentrated
spiritual food to nourish him in his lonely rambles.</p>

<p>The thaw came early, with rainy winds and intervals of frost;
and on one of his excursions Vance was caught in a storm of
sleet, lost his way when night fell, and got back to camp
exhausted and shivering. That night he flamed in fever and shook
with coughing, and the doctor who came over from the nearest town
muttered in a corner with Brail, who looked frightened and
bewildered. Vance was aware that he must be seriously ill, and
that Brail would have liked him to be taken away; but it was
evidently thought unadvisable to move him, and he felt weakly
thankful when he understood that he was to be left where he was.
Brail and the lumberman's wife nursed him to the best of their
ability, but the woman was ignorant and clumsy, and Brail in a
state of chronic bewilderment, always mislaying his spectacles,
and totally unable to remember any instructions the doctor had
neglected to write down. In spite of all this Vance gradually
worked his way back to health, and the weeks wore on slowly but
not unhappily till a day came when he got to his feet again and
shambled a little way along the wet path in the mild spring
sun.</p>

<p>After that the time passed pleasantly enough. The subdued
ecstasy of convalescence was in his veins, and he looked out with
eyes cleansed by solitude on a new world in which everything was
beautiful and important, and seemed to have been created for his
special use. His physical suffering and helplessness seemed to
have matured his mind, and detached it from the things of the
past like a ripe fruit from the tree. Saint Augustine's words
came back to him: "Become a man and thou shalt feed on Me"; and
he felt that at last he was ready to taste of the food of the
full-grown, however bitter to the lips it might be.</p>

<p>He had thought vaguely of staying on at Belair till the Camp
of Hope reopened, and then of hiring a bungalow higher up in the
hills and settling down to his new book. He had not yet worked
out any plan beyond that, though a plan there must be if he were
to regain a hold on himself. He wanted first to secure a few
months of quiet for his book, and to watch the advance of spring,
and the sudden blazing up of summer, in that powerful untamed
landscape; but he saw that to recover his bodily strength he must
get away to better care and more food. It was queer how even a
touch of pneumonia did you in--his legs still rambled away from
him like a baby's when he attempted his daily walk...</p>

<p>His family did not know of his illness; he had sworn Brail to
secrecy on the first day, and the timid creature had obeyed, no
doubt privately relieved at not having to provide for other
visitors. Vance had been touched by Brail's awkward devotion
during his illness. He had found out that Brail had tramped
twenty miles through the snow to get the doctor, and that his
reluctance to keep Vance at the camp was due merely to the fear
of not being able to give him proper care. The men had grown to
feel more at ease with each other, and one day Brail, in a burst
of confidence, confessed to Vance that his great desire had been
to enter the ministry, but that he had been discouraged by the
difficulties of theological study. He had been unable, after
repeated attempts, to pass his examination, and his failure had
been a lasting mortification. "I never could seem to take to any
other profession, not even zoology," he said mournfully, wiping
the mist from his spectacles.</p>

<p>"Was that what made you decide to stay up here?" Vance
questioned idly; and to his surprise he saw the blood rise under
the other's sallow skin.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Brail hastily, turning away to fumble for his
spectacle-case.</p>

<p>Vance lay back in his chair and looked up at the low
smoke-blackened ceiling. There was a long silence, and his mind
had wandered away to other matters when he became aware that
Brail was still standing before him, his hands in his pockets,
his narrow forehead anxiously wrinkled, "I've been wanting to
tell you for some time," said Brail, through a cough of
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Tell me what?"</p>

<p>Brail bowed his head and spoke low. "It was a woman," he said.
"I met her when I was observing animals at a circus. She was a
lion-tamer," he added with another cough.</p>

<p>Vance stared up at him, convulsed with sudden laughter; but he
saw the other's tortured face, and mastered his muscles in time.
"Well--isn't that what they all are?" he said.</p>

<p>Brail stared back, blinking down through his spectacles.
"Er--lion-tamers? Ah, yes--I see!" he exclaimed, his cautious
wrinkled smile suddenly responding to the pleasantry. "But I
meant it literally," he jerked out, and turned in haste from the
room. Vance, lying back, saw him pass in front of the window and
walk away with mournful strides through the mud. "The food of the
full-grown," he murmured to himself as Brail disappeared among
the hemlocks.</p>

<p>Yes, it was time to eat of that food; time to grow up; time to
fly from his shielded solitude and go down again among the
lion-tamers. He was glad that his possessions were already
packed, and that he was to leave the next morning; but when the
cutter stood at the door, and his bags were stowed under the
seat, he turned to Brail with a final pang of reluctance. "Well,
goodbye. You may see me back yet."</p>

<p>Brail blinked and shook his head. "You'll think so, maybe; but
you won't come," he answered, and stood watching Vance drive
away.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The first night in Chicago nearly made Brail's prophecy come
true. Vance had gone there straight from the camp. Now that his
grandmother was dead he could not face the idea of returning to
Euphoria; and he meant to stay a few days in Chicago and try to
think out some plan for the next months. But the sudden
transition from the winter silence of the hills to the tumult of
the streets was more than his shaken nerves could bear. These
millions of little people rushing about their business and
pleasure in an endless uproar of their own making were like
strange insects driven by unintelligible instincts; and he was
too tired to be interested in observing them. Ah, how tired he
was--how unutterably tired! All the factitious energy accumulated
during his last days at Belair had been lost in the descent to
the heavy atmosphere of the city. He felt will-less and adrift,
and the food of the full-grown seemed too strong a fare for
him.</p>

<p>The next morning he got as far as the telegraph office in the
lobby of the hotel. He inscribed Brail's name on a telegraph
blank, and was about to write under it: "Can I come back?" when
he was checked by a vision of the poor man shambling off alone
down the muddy path to the camp, spectrally followed by the
limping figure of Chris Churley. There went the two deniers, the
two fugitives--poor Chris, poor Brail! No--that was not the
solution to Vance's difficulty; it lay somewhere ahead of him, in
the crowd and the struggle. At present he couldn't see just
where; but a weak longing overcame him to be again among familiar
faces and in scenes associated with his past. It occurred to him
that he might have gone back to Laura Lou's mother if she had
still lived at Paul's Landing, in the tumble-down house above the
Hudson where he had been so happy and so miserable; but doubtless
she was still in California with her son, who had gone out there
to work as a nurseryman. Vance went up to his room and lay down
on the bed. He felt too weary to think, or to want anything, or
to make any fresh resolves, since he knew they would be broken...The
next morning he took a ticket for Paul's Landing.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c40">XL</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When the train left him at Paul's Landing Vance knew that what
had taken him there was not the wish to see the cottage where he
had lived with Laura Lou. That past was buried under the dead
leaves of too many seasons. What he craved for, with a sort of
tremulous convalescent hunger, was a sight of the Willows, the
old house where his real life had begun.</p>

<p>It was less than three years since he had come to Paul's
Landing to implore Halo Tarrant to go away with him, instead of
waiting to obtain her divorce; but on that feverish day he had
not given the Willows a thought, and his last sight of the
fantastic old house and the abandoned garden, though not remote
in years, seemed to belong to his embryonic stage.</p>

<p>The day was soft, the air full of spring scents and the
shimmer of sun through wrinkled leaves. Vance got into the tram
which passed by the lane leading to the Willows. The mean
outskirts of the town were meaner than ever; new cottages had
been built, but the old ones had not been repainted. The suburb,
evidently uncertain of its future, awaited in slatternly
unconcern the coming of the land-speculator or of the municipal
park-designer. But in the lane that climbed to the Willows Vance
felt his boy's heart wake in him. From the ruts underfoot to the
elm boughs overhead, nothing around him was changed; and when he
reached the gate and gazed across the lawn to the house, its
inconsequent turrets and gables showed uncertainly through the
same veil of weeping willows.</p>

<p>So completely was he drawn back into the past that he felt in
his pocket for the key he used to take from his mother-in-law's
drawer when he stole up the lane to meet Halo Spear--and later to
meet Halo Tarrant. The key was not there, but as he leaned on the
gate in the attitude of the sentimental wanderer he felt it yield
to his pressure, and walked in.</p>

<p>Every fibre of his past was interwoven with that scene. Long
before he had flown there to his first meetings with Halo, he and
Laura Lou and her brother had ranged through the decaying garden
and waked the echoes of Miss Emily Lorburn's strange old
dwelling. In the arbour at the back of the house Vance had put a
first kiss on Laura Lou's fluttering eyelids; on the doorstep he
had sat and waited through a long afternoon for Halo Spear, who
had promised to meet him and forgotten her promise; among the
musty book-shelves of the library, and under the sad painted gaze
of Miss Emily Lorburn, he had first travelled in the realms of
gold, with Halo guiding him.</p>

<p>In that setting she came suddenly back to him, poised for
flight as he had first known her; then, after her marriage, under
a shadow of disquietude torn by laughter and irony, but never
dispelled till he took her in his arms on the night of their
flight. Thus detached from the uncertainties and irritations of
their life together, her renovated image leaned to him from that
enchanted world where they had first met. The memory caught him
about the heart, and if she had come to him across the lawn at
that moment all his scruples and resolves might have been swept
away in a flood of tenderness. But he was determined not to
abandon himself to such dreams. His future, wherever it led, was
to be ruled by realities, not illusions. He had thought he loved
her, and he had failed her; she had accepted the fact, and faced
it with her usual ironic courage; and the one service his
unstable heart could do her now was to leave her in peace and go
his way.</p>

<p>He stood for a long time on the lawn, remembering how, when he
had first come there, fresh from the mediocrity and uniformity of
Euphoria, the house had seemed as vast as a Roman villa and as
venerable as a feudal castle. Through its modest doorway he had
entered into a legendary past; its shingled tower was Sister
Anne's outlook, its bracketed balconies overhung the perilous
foam on which his imagination had voyaged ever since. The old
house had been his fairy godmother, and it was only now, as he
looked at it again, that he understood.</p>

<p>He went up to the door, studying the shuttered windows,
looking for signs of change, catching at each stray tendril of
association. Of change he saw little; the family had always kept
the house in decent repair, and its be-gabled front and bracketed
balconies looked hardly more blistered and weather-streaked than
when he had first seen them. Last year's dead geraniums still
dangled from the fluted iron vases flanking the door; and from
the fretwork of the porch a honeysuckle hung.</p>

<p>On the other side of the house, where the library looked out
over a sloping lawn, the verandah was still clutched and
enveloped in the huge twining arms of the ancient wistaria. It
was already heavy with budding clusters, and Vance closed his
eyes and called up the June day when from roof to cellar it had
poured in a cataract of silvery lilac. He noticed that the
library windows were open, as they used to be on cleaning days;
and his heart beat fast as he mounted the verandah steps and
looked in. But the room was empty, the books stood undisturbed.
He remarked only one change: a sheet had been hung over Miss
Lorburn's portrait, and her sad eyes no longer looked down on
him. The covering of the picture suggested that there might be
cleaners or painters at work; but all the other windows were
barred, and he heard no sounds within, and saw no one about.</p>

<p>He turned and looked across the lawn at the broken-down arbour
where he and Laura Lou had sat. His thoughts went out to it in an
act of piety, as though its broken trellis were arched above her
grave. But he no longer recognized himself in the boy who had sat
there on that June morning and caressed her frightened eyelids.
His real life had long been elsewhere, and the thought of her
stirred only a shadowy tenderness. He went a little way down the
lawn and then turned back.</p>

<p>The house, at that distance, looked more than ever like the
steel engraving in the old book on landscape-gardening which he
and Halo had once laughed over--but oddly shrunken and small, as
though from a full-page picture it had dwindled to the ornamental
tailpiece of a chapter. And that, after all, was what it was, he
mused; though he was still in the twenties the picture of the
Willows seemed to close the chapter of his youth...He walked
back to the gate, and went out.</p>

<p>In the lane a man was repairing the palings. He looked at
Vance, and the latter asked him if any one was living at the
Willows. The man said there was generally a caretaker there, but
he believed the place had just been sold, and the new people were
moving in. A pang went through Vance; he remembered how often he
and Halo, in their European wanderings, had talked of coming back
some day to live at the Willows. An idle fancy then; but now it
had the poignancy of an unfulfilled dream. Where were the people
from? he asked. The man said he was new to the place, and didn't
know; but he'd heard they were from New York, and the carpenter
who employed him had been told to start work that week. He
guessed the old place needed a good deal done to it to make folks
comfortable there.</p>

<p>Vance walked slowly back to the town. He had meant to take an
afternoon train to New York; but he felt weak and tired, and the
idea of big cities frightened him--perhaps also the possibility
that in that particular one he might run across Floss Delaney.
When he left Belair he had felt equipped to meet not only old
memories but the people who embodied them; now a singular
lassitude possessed him, and he thought enviously of Brail's
figure retreating alone into the depths of the hemlock forest. He
left his luggage at the dingy hotel opposite the station, and
went out again.</p>

<p>He wandered through the town in the direction of the road that
led up to Eaglewood, the old house above the Hudson where Halo
Spear had lived before her marriage. A myriad arms seemed to draw
him along that steep ascent; but half way up he turned, and began
to walk resolutely back to the town. It came over him that he was
seeking the solace of these old memories as a frightened child
runs to hide its face in its nurse's lap; and in a rush of
self-contempt he strode down the hill to the station. What he
wanted was to regain his strength and then face life afresh, not
to go whining back to a past from which he had cut himself off by
his own choice.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c41">XLI</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Halo Tarrant sat on the verandah at Eaglewood, pencil and
note-block in hand. She murmured over: "Six enamelled pails,
eight ditto hot-water jugs, a set of aluminium saucepans, ten
coal-scuttles...I suppose some day I may be able to afford
central heating...Oh, Frenny, if you knew how those
coal-scuttles bore me!"</p>

<p>She dropped the note-block to the floor, and leaned back, her
eyes fixed on the great sweep of the river shining far below
through the woodlands. "If I hadn't had cousin Emily's
linen-closet I should never have the courage to begin..." The
words sounded slightly plaintive, but a smile interrupted them.
"Isn't it providential, Frenny, that the poor lady's disappointed
love affair should have provided me with those dozens and dozens
of unused napery? I'm sure napery was what she called it, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>Frenside, who had come up to Eaglewood to be with Halo for the
week-end, gave an ironic grunt, and murmured: "Your sentiments
are as inhuman as they are natural. But how do you know she had a
love affair?"</p>

<p>Halo lifted her eyebrows in surprise. "Why, Vance"--she began,
and then broke off, not because she was reluctant to pronounce
his name, but because she realized that in her thoughts the
romance he had woven about Emily Lorburn had gradually
substituted itself for the reality. "Vance always said she had,"
she declared, still smiling. She had made it a rule from the
first to speak of him, simply and naturally, when the occasion
required; at first it had cost her an effort, but now she could
name him without pain, almost with a melancholy pleasure--as if
he were dead, she sometimes mused. In truth there was a sense in
which all her past had died, leaving in her the seed of a new
vitality--the life of her child. During the long slow months
since she had parted from Vance in Paris this detachment and
reassurance had grown in her with the child's growth; a kind of
calm animal beatitude of which she was at first ashamed and then
glad, as she understood that this was the season allotted to her
by nature for rest and renewal.</p>

<p>Her inward tranquillity had not come to her suddenly. The
first weeks after Vance had gone to America had been a dark blur
of pain. She had played her part valiantly, affected to accept
their separation as natural, and perhaps only temporary, yet
rejected any definite suggestion of a future reunion. The future
was to take care of itself; for the moment they both needed a
change...She got through the parting on this note; and then
blackness closed in on her.</p>

<p>After her visit to Tarrant her existence for a time had no
distinguishable features. She thought the dead in their graves
must be as she was. But out of that annihilation slowly a new
life had emerged, her own interwoven with her child's. The
numbness gradually became quietude, the quietude a kind of sober
joy, till she could now look back on that first phase of anguish
as mystics do on the dark passages of their spiritual initiation.
When she decided to return to America and establish herself at
the Willows she had reached a degree of composure which made it
almost easy to speak of the past, and even to let her mind dwell
on it.</p>

<p>The decision to live at the Willows had been her final step
toward recovery. The thought of the old place drew her back with
a thousand threads of association; and the mere fact that the
house was her own, the only place on earth that she could dispose
of as she chose, made her wish that her child should be born
there. But for a long time after her return she had postponed her
decision. At first she wondered whether she could face life alone
in that mournful old house; then whether her presence there might
not be an actual embarrassment to her parents. She had been
prepared for her family's opposition to the plan, but hardly for
their dismay at her return to America. To be reunited to their
darling after such a long separation was a joy indeed; but it was
really incredible that Halo should not have understood how much
simpler it would have been to...to get through the
unfortunate business that lay ahead of her before returning to
New York...Her mother would of course have gone to Europe to
join her...</p>

<p>"But I want my child to be born at the Willows," Halo quietly
interposed.</p>

<p>"But at the Willows you can't keep it a secret, you can't
possibly keep people from talking--"</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh, and bent to kiss Mrs. Spear's
anguished forehead. "But I <i>want</i> people to talk about my
baby; the people I'm fond of, I mean. And what do I care for the
others? He's going to be the most wonderful baby in the
world--you don't suppose I'm going to make a mystery of him, do
you?"</p>

<p>Slowly her parents understood that nothing could alter her
attitude, and they accepted the situation, Mrs. Spear secretly
excited at the idea that the defiance she had always longed to
fling at society was actually being flung by her own daughter,
Mr. Spear incurably depressed, but silenced by the fact that here
at last was a grievance he could not ventilate in the newspapers.
Gradually Halo's quiet ascendancy asserted itself over both, and
before she had been at home for many weeks they had fitted into
their lives the new fact that she meant to follow her own way,
neither defiantly nor apologetically, but as if it were of more
concern to herself than it could possibly be to others. Still,
she understood that her parents would be happier if she went to
Eaglewood as soon as possible, and after staying with them for a
short time in New York she had opened the house and settled
herself there with two servants; and with the approach of summer
the desire to be installed at the Willows before her child was
born overcame her hesitation, and she began to confer with
painters and contractors, and to draw up her housekeeping lists.
The renewed contact with practical questions seemed to dispel her
last uncertainties, to make her feel that she had a plan of life
again, and was in the salutary hold of habit; and the days which
had dragged by so heavily began to move at a more normal pace. It
was curious, she thought, how far pots and pans could go toward
filling an empty heart; and she remembered how she had vaguely
resented Vance's faculty for escaping from anxiety and
unhappiness by plunging into his work. House-making and
housekeeping were her escape, she supposed: she must build up a
home for her son...</p>

<p>Two or three times her mother had come to spend a day with
her, and now and then Frenside turned up for a week-end; but at
other times she remained by herself, increasingly busy with her
child's affairs and her own, letting her mind wander among the
crowding memories of her own childhood, and watching the slow
changes of the familiar landscape from spring to summer. There
were moments when she wondered if, after her baby was born, she
would lapse from her state of ruminating calm, and become again
the passionate anxious Halo of old; but it was idle to think of
that now, and she put the question quietly from her.</p>

<p>Frenside had not immediately taken up her allusion to Vance;
she noticed that it still embarrassed him to speak to her on the
subject. But after a moment he said: "I've been wanting for some
time to tell you--"</p>

<p>Her heart gave a start at the preamble. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Speaking of Weston--I don't believe I ever mentioned that I
ran across him in New York three or four months ago, did I?"</p>

<p>It was the first time that any one had spoken to her of having
seen Vance since he and she had said goodbye in Paris, and the
careful structure of her composure trembled on its base and gave
way. "No; you didn't."...Her voice failed her.</p>

<p>"Well, there wasn't much point in it--I mean in telling you.
He wanted to know how you were; he said he might ask me to take
you a message--but he never has. So I waited."</p>

<p>Halo's heart dilated and then sank back to its usual frozen
quiet. "He never has." She wondered why Frenside had told her,
then?</p>

<p>"Only," Frenside pursued, "I've been wondering, now that your
divorce proceedings are well under way, and everything's clear on
that score, whether I oughtn't--"</p>

<p>Halo reflected for a moment. "Do you know where he is?"</p>

<p>"Not a notion; I've never laid eyes on him since; but I
suppose a letter to his publisher would be forwarded."</p>

<p>She made no answer to this, and he went on: "The fact is, I
said nothing at the time because the rumour was that he was in
pursuit of that meteoric young woman--what's her name? The girl
who was married the other day to the Duke of Spartivento. People
seemed to think Weston meant to marry her."</p>

<p>"Yes; I know." She drew a deep breath. "And now that she's
married, you think--?"</p>

<p>"I think Weston ought to know how things stand with you."</p>

<p>There was another silence; Halo could not bring any order into
her agitation. But at last she said slowly: "What does it matter?
I've thought all that out. If it's not Floss Delaney it will be
some other woman..."</p>

<p>"<i>Dichterliebe,</i> eh? Well, you're probably right. Most
artists are incurably polygamous. When they're not it's because
they die young--and their books generally do too. But I don't
know that their loving so lavishly matters as much in itself as
in what it makes of them; what sort of stuff they turn it into. I
don't pretend to know yet what Weston's going to turn into. After
all, you can't squeeze the whole of any human being into an
epigram. But Weston went to see Tarrant, and said some things to
him that came out of his very soul; and it's not easy to say
things that come out of the soul to Tarrant."</p>

<p>The blood rose to Halo's face, and she bent to pick up her
papers and pencil. She had disciplined herself to hear Vance
blamed and disparaged, but to hear him spoken of with sympathy
and understanding sent a sudden anguish through her. She tried to
answer but could not, and sat fluttering her list between her
fingers, and murmuring over to herself: "A set of aluminium
saucepans--ten coal-scuttles--"</p>

<p>Frenside stood up from his chair; the sun had veered round,
leaving the verandah in shade, and the evening air was chilly.
"My dear, you're very young to cut your life in two like this.
Won't you let me try to see him?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Don't think I'm ungrateful. But don't ask
me again, please; it's useless."</p>

<p>Frenside shrugged, and turned away. "Let's go in, then; it's
getting cold."</p>

<p>She made no answer, and he left her sitting there and walked
into the drawing-room, where a wood-fire was smouldering. She
meant to follow him in a moment, but first she must let the
troubled waves subside. It was too soon, after all, to talk of
Vance even with so old a friend...</p>

<p>Presently she felt quieter, and got up to follow Frenside. But
first she opened the French window into the hall, in order to
hang her cloak on its usual peg under the stairs. As she crossed
the hall she noticed that the front door was open. She went
forward to shut it; but when she approached she saw that a man
was standing on the steps, his back to the door. He must have
heard her footfall on the oak floor, for he turned abruptly, and
in the failing light she recognized Vance. She gave a little cry,
and they stood and looked at each other. "Halo--" he began in a
dazed voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Van! Where did you come from? How tired you look! But
you've been ill--you must have been very ill! What's been the
matter?" She swept forward on a great rush of pity, but he drew
back, passing a slow bewildered hand over his forehead. "No--I'm
all right...I'm all right again..."</p>

<p>The change in his appearance frightened her, almost made her
feel as if she were speaking to a stranger. He had grown so thin
that he seemed taller, and his face was changed too. All its
boyishness was gone; it was drawn and stern, like that of a man
who has been through some inward ordeal which makes everything
else remote. She felt that she was a part of that remoteness, and
the feeling made her speak to him almost shyly. "Van--why do you
stand there? Don't you mean to come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll come in." His voice was low and automatic; he spoke
as if he were reciting a lesson. "I didn't intend to come here
now," he added, as if it were an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Not now?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, and took a few steps into the hall. "No. I
really came back just to look at the Willows. And then they told
me down at the station that you were here."</p>

<p>"At the Willows? You've been there now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I had to...They said you'd sold it, and the
contractors were going to begin work; I came just in time. I
suppose some instinct told me."</p>

<p>"Sold it? I'm going to live there myself!" she exclaimed, her
voice trembling with the announcement.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a kind of slow surprise. "You--at the
Willows? I hadn't thought of that..."</p>

<p>"We used to think of it--don't you remember?"</p>

<p>He gave an uneasy laugh. "I can't always separate what we've
talked of from what I've imagined."</p>

<p>"That's because you've been ill, Van--"</p>

<p>"Yes; I've been ill." He stood looking about the hall with
timid unfamilar eyes. "Is there any place where I can talk to you
alone?"</p>

<p>Halo opened the door of her father's study, and led him in,
closing the door after her. Vance still looked about him with
that odd estranged look which frightened her more than his
thinness and his pallour. She felt almost as if he did not see
her. But after a moment his eyes turned back to hers. "You see, I
wanted to tell you why I'm not coming back--"</p>

<p>Her heart gave a frightened plunge. "Not--you're not coming
back?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No; not now. Not for a long time, perhaps.
You see, it's this way; I swore to myself when I was up in the
woods that I must pull myself together first, make something out
of myself, be worth something...You understand, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Halo stood looking at him with troubled eyes. "Up in the
woods, dear? Where were you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, up at Belair. It's in Wisconsin. I went there after my
grandmother died. She died last winter--you didn't know? After
that there were things I had to fight out alone. I was getting
hold of myself, I really was--and then I was knocked out, and had
pneumonia, or something..."</p>

<p>"Vance, I knew you'd been terribly ill!"</p>

<p>"I'm all right now--I'm as right as ever. Only I've got no
will and no purpose. That's what I wanted you to understand. I
wanted to come back some day, though I didn't know whether you'd
ever have me. But I didn't mean to come till afterward, not till
I was fit to know my own mind, and stick to my purpose, and be of
some use to you. And all that's gone...blown away like ashes...I'm
burnt out; I'm just cinders..."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Halo's scruples were borne down by a fresh wave
of solicitude. To see him so powerless and broken made her feel
strong, confident, sure of herself. Whatever might come later,
for the moment the way was clear. "But the very time to come
back, dear, was when you needed me. We can let afterward take
care on itself."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head, his anxious eyes still fixed on her.
"No. It's not the time; I've got to make good first. Maybe it's
my pride--I don't know. Anyway, I wanted to explain to you and
then go off again. You understand?"</p>

<p>Her hopes sank under a return of perplexity. Did she
understand--would she ever? She returned his look with a faint
smile. "Did you really come all the way to Paul's Landing just to
tell me that you were going away again?"</p>

<p>He flushed feverishly under his drawn pallour. "No; I came
because I couldn't help myself. I've been down in hell, and I
wanted to see the stars again. That's all."</p>

<p>"All?" She tried to keep the smile on her twitching lips. "One
glimpse is enough, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No; it's not enough. But it's more than I've got a right to."
He straightened his shoulders abruptly. "Till I'm sure of myself,
anyhow."</p>

<p>Halo hesitated. The unseen barrier between them seemed as
impenetrable as ever; she felt that she might wound her hands,
and waste her strength against it, in vain. There might be
subterfuges, tricks--appeals to his emotion by the display of
hers. But that had never been her way; her pride met his with an
equal shock. If that was his view of their relation, he had a
right to it. But she was resolved first to make sure that the
reason he gave was the true one.</p>

<p>"Van," she said, "when you say you're not sure of yourself,
are you thinking of Floss Delaney? I've got a right to ask you
that, you know."</p>

<p>A painful contraction passed over his face, and she wondered
if she had not committed a folly in touching on the wound. But
she was not good at subterfuges, and it seemed more loyal to
repay his frankness by her own. "Floss Delaney...?" He
repeated the name slowly and half-wonderingly, as if asking
himself what it signified to him at that moment.</p>

<p>"If there'd been any likelihood of your marrying her," Halo
hurried on, "I should have been the first to stand aside--you
know it was on that account that I suggested our parting...But
now that she's married..."</p>

<p>She saw Vance turn pale, and stretch out his hand to the back
of the armchair against which he was leaning. "Ah, she's
married--? Up in the woods I hardly ever saw the papers...I
didn't know..." He stood looking down at the floor for a moment
or two; then he raised his head with a nervous laugh. "She's put
through that deal too, has she? Spartivento, I suppose...Well,
it's nothing to me...I'd said goodbye to her long before."</p>

<p>A great weight was lifted from Halo's heart; but in another
moment it descended on her again, this time with a more
intolerable oppression. She looked into his face, and said to
herself that there are farewells which are powerless to separate.
"A real goodbye, Vance? Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"God, yes. All that's ashes...Only, you see, she took
something with her; my belief in things, my old reasons for
living and working. It's as if my mainspring was broken. I've got
to get it mended first." Suddenly he moved toward her with a
gesture of passionate entreaty. "Don't you see,
Halo--<i>can't</i> you see? I can't come back to you just because
I'm at the end of everything. To any other woman--not to you. But
I wasn't strong enough to go away without telling you; the only
strength left to me is the strength not to pretend, or to invent
lying reasons. And that's not much."</p>

<p>She continued to look at him with something of his own
timidity. "It might be enough--" she began, as if a voice within
her had spoken without her will.</p>

<p>He shook his head, but she hurried on: "If you say no, it must
be because I'm less to you than any other woman, and not
more."</p>

<p>He said slowly: "It's not being more or less; you're
different. I read something up there in the woods about God...
or experience...it's the same thing...being the food of
the full-grown. That seemed to explain a lot to me. I'm not fit
for you yet, Halo; I'm only just learning how to walk..."</p>

<p>She leaned against the mantelpiece, fighting down the old
tremors in her breast; at length she gave a little laugh. "But
then I shall have two children to take care of instead of
one!"</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to her, and she moved across the room and
stood before him. With a kind of tranquil gravity she lifted up
her arms in the ancient attitude of prayer.</p>

<p>For a moment his brow kept its deep furrows of bewilderment;
then he gave a start and went up to her with illuminated
eyes.</p>

<p>"You see we belong to each other after all," she said; but as
her arms sank about his neck he bent his head and put his lips to
a fold of her loose dress.</p>
