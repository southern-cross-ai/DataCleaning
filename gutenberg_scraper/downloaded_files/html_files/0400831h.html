<p><i>A bedroom shared by</i> GRAINGER <i>and</i> BRENTNALL <i>in
the cottage of</i> MRS PLUM. <i>Both men are dressing.</i>
GRAINGER <i>goes to the door and calls to</i> MRS PLUM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>GRAINGER: Bring me some collars up.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And what are you going to do?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: God knows.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: How much money have you got?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Four damn quid.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Hm!--You're well off, considering. But what
<i>do</i> you think of doing?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I don't know.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Where do you think of going Saturday?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Hell.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Too expensive, my boy--four quid won't carry you
there.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Oh chuck it, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What the Hanover's the good of chucking it? You're
not a blooming cock robin, to take no thought for the morrow.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> MRS PLUM <i>with the collars.</i></p>

<p>MRS PLUM: Gee, I'm sorry I forgot 'em, Dr Grainger. I'm ever
so sorry.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Don't fret yourself about that, Mrs Plum. You're all
right, you are.</p>

<p>MRS PLUM: Gee, but I can't get it out of my head, that there
what you've just told me.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You want to sneeze hard, Mrs Plum. That'll shift
it.</p>

<p>MRS PLUM (<i>laughing</i>): Hee-hee--hark you there now. And
have you got rid of it off your mind, Dr Grainger?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: My head's as clear as a bell o' brass, Mrs Plum.
Nothing ails me.</p>

<p>MRS PLUM: My word, it doesn't. My word, but you're looking
well, you're a sight better than when you come. Isn't he, Mr
Brentnall?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: He's too healthy for anything, Mrs Plum--he's so
healthy, he'd walk slap into a brick wall, and never know he'd
hurt himself.</p>

<p>MRS PLUM: Gee--I don't know. But that there as you told me, Dr
Grainger--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Here, you go and see if that's Jack Magneer, and if
it is, let him come up.</p>

<p>MRS PLUM: You're a caution, you are that, Dr Grainger.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> MRS PLUM.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: The girl is gone on you, the kid is yours. You are
a married man, and you mean to abide by your family?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What the devil else is there to do?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Very well. Have you bothered about another job?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No--I did when I was in Wolverhampton. Look what a
fiendish business it is, offering yourself and being refused like
a dog.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: So you've taken no steps.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And you've absolutely no idea what you're going to
do on Saturday, when you've finished here?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And yet you mean to stick by your wife and kid?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What else can I do?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Well, you're a beauty! You're just skulking, like a
frightened rabbit.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Am I, begad?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Are you fond of the kid?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I shouldn't like anything to happen to it.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Neither should I. But the feelings of your breast
towards it--?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well, I'm a lot <i>fonder</i> of that youngster at
my digs in Wolverhampton--you know--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Then you feel no paternal emotion?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No. Don't talk rot.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: How often have you been over to see your wife?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Once.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Once since you were married?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Yes.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And that when the baby was first born?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Yes.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And you're living--which, a recluse, or a gay
bachelor?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You can imagine me a recluse.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You're a blossom, Georgie, you're a jewel of a
muddler.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: How could I help it! I was careful enough with the
girl--I never thought, to tell you the truth, that--here's
Jack!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: That what?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Shut up. Jack's a fine fellow.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Needs to be, to match you.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Now Bill Brentnall, none of your sark.</p>

<p>JACK'S VOICE: How long are you going to be?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: How-do Jack! Shan't be a sec. Come up.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> JACK MAGNEER--<i>aged 33</i>--<i>very big, a
farmer, something of a gentleman, wears leggings and breeches,
and a black bow tie.</i></p>

<p>JACK: Seem to be donning yourselves up--how are you?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Mr Magneer--Mr Brentnall: Jack--Billy.</p>

<p>JACK: Yis, quite so. How are you, Billy?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I'm very well. You're Miss Magneer's brother?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Sally's.</p>

<p>JACK: Yis, I am, and what of it?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Oh--only you are lucky.</p>

<p>GRAINGER <i>whistles gaily.</i></p>

<p>JACK: What you whistling for, George lad? Aren't I lucky?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I wish Sally was <i>my</i> sister, Jack.</p>

<p>JACK: Yis, you do, an' so do I, George lad--then me an' you'd
be brothers.--Oh, my good God, are you going to be all night
titivating yourselves up?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Jack's in a hurry.</p>

<p>JACK: No I'm not, but damn it all--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Alright Jacko, alright. I know she's a very nice
girl--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Where are you taking me?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: To see some real fine girls.</p>

<p>JACK: Not so much fine girls, Billy--some damn <i>nice</i>
girls, <i>nice</i> girls, mind you.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Quite right, Jacko. (<i>Seriously.</i>) No, but they
are, Billy, real nice girls. Three sisters, orphans.</p>

<p>JACK: An' the oldest of them will happen to be Mrs
Grainger--eh, what?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Liar!</p>

<p>JACK: You see Billy, it's like this. I'm glad you've come,
because it levels us up. I believe you're a nice chap. Don't you
take me wrong. I mean you're not one of these damn sods as can
see nowt in a girl but--you know.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Yes.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Yes, Billy knows. Most moral young man.</p>

<p>JACK: Fooling apart, George, aren't they nice girls?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: <i>Really</i> nice girls, they are.</p>

<p>JACK: But you see, there's three of 'em--an' we've never been
but two of us--d'you twig?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I twig.</p>

<p>JACK: But no fooling, mind you.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Thanks for your caution, Mr Magneer.</p>

<p>JACK: Oh no, no. Nothing of the sort: only they <i>are</i>
nice girls--you see what I mean--oh no, Billy--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: And three of 'em.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And the odd one falls to me. Thanks, I was born to
oblige.</p>

<p>JACK: Now Billy, no. I want you t'have a good time. You see
what I mean. I'm willing to step aside. You're here only for a
bit--I'm always here. So I want you--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: "I want all of you t'have a good time."</p>

<p>JACK: Yis, I do. I do that, George.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: That's always Jacko's cry--"I want you t'have it
your own road. I'm willing any road. I want you t'have a good
time." Self-effacing chap is Jack.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Do I put on a dinner jacket?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Good God, no--have you brought one?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Well--I might have to dine at some people's down
towards Ashbourne.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>A long, low dining-room</i>--<i>table laid for
supper</i>--<i>bowls of crimson and white flowers, a large
lamp</i>--<i>an old-fashioned room, furnished with taste.</i></p>

<p><i>The oldest</i> MISS CALLADINE--<i>aged 32, tall,
slim, pale, dressed in black, wearing Parma violets, looks
ladylike, but rather yearning. She walks about restlessly.
Enter</i> DR GRAINGER.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>ANNIE: Aren't you late?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: A little--waiting for my friend. He's gone round to
"The George" with Jack--some arrangement about farm stock. (<i>He
takes both her hands, which she offers him yearningly, and, after
glancing round, kisses her hastily, as if unwillingly.</i>)
Where's Emily?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Emily and Ada are both entertaining Mrs Wesson in the
drawing-room. I hope they'll get rid of her before Jack comes.
I'm afraid we are being talked about. I'm afraid I'm not doing my
duty by the girls.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What do you mean?</p>

<p>ANNIE: You are here so often.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I'm going away directly, so you'll be safe after
Saturday.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Really going away on Saturday--really--really. (<i>Puts
her hands on his shoulders.</i>)</p>

<p>GRAINGER: That's right.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Then people will talk more than ever. I shall be
considered loose: and what's to become of the girls--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: <i>You</i> considered loose--oh C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p>ANNIE: Where are you going?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Don't know.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Why won't you tell me?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Because I don't know. I am waiting for a letter--it
will come to-morrow. Either I shall be going to Scotland, or down
to London--one or the other, but I don't know which.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Scotland or London!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I hope it's London.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Why do you?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well--more life, for one thing.</p>

<p>ANNIE: And is it "life" you want? That sort of life?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Not that sort, exactly--but--oh, by the way, I told
you I was bringing my friend--</p>

<p>ANNIE: Mr Brentnall--yes.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well, don't be surprised if I seem rather different
tonight, will you? Billy's very circumspect, <i>very</i>
circumspect--nice, mind you, but <i>good.</i></p>

<p>ANNIE: I see.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You'll like him though.</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>bitingly</i>): In spite of his goodness.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Yes, I know you like "life" better than
"goodness"--don't you now?</p>

<p><i>He puts his hand under her chin.</i></p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>drawing away</i>): You seem to know a great deal
about me.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I know what you want.</p>

<p>ANNIE: What?</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>glancing round to see if he is
safe</i>--<i>taking her in his arms, pressing her close, kissing
her. She submits because she can scarcely help
herself</i>--<i>there is a sound of feet and voices</i>--<i>he
hastily releases her</i>): That!</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>struggling with herself</i>): Indeed no, Dr
Grainger.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: That's the ticket--keep it up, Annie.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> EMILY <i>and</i> ADA CALLADINE--EMILY,
<i>aged 27, quiet, self-possessed, dressed all in
black</i>--ADA, <i>aged 23</i>--<i>rather plump, handsome,
charmingly young and wicked-looking</i>--<i>dressed in black and
purple, with a crimson flower.</i></p>

<p>ANNIE: Has Mrs Wesson gone?</p>

<p>ADA: Not before she heard a man's voice--I told her you were
engaged.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You what?</p>

<p>ADA (<i>bursting with laughter</i>): I told her Annie was
engaged.</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>severely</i>): With a caller, you mean, Ada?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>ADA: Yes--oh yes--oh how <i>funny!</i></p>

<p>GRAINGER: Not funny at all--Jack's doing some business round
at "The George", Emily.</p>

<p>EMILY: Is he?</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>discomfited</i>): I think I'll go and hurry them
up.</p>

<p>ADA: Do!</p>

<p>ANNIE: You think it is quite safe to bring your <i>good</i>
friend here?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Oh, quite safe, Annie--don't be alarmed. Ta-ta!</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> GRAINGER. <i>He is heard running down the
stairs.</i></p>

<p>ANNIE: I don't think Dr Grainger improves on acquaintance.</p>

<p>ADA: <i>We've</i> never got any further with him, so <i>we</i>
can't say.</p>

<p>EMILY: Why do you think so, Annie?</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>rather haughtily</i>): You would not guess what he
said to me.</p>

<p>ADA: I think you've given him rather a long rope.</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>with dignity</i>): If I have, he's hit me across the
face with it.</p>

<p>EMILY: What did he say, Annie?</p>

<p>ANNIE: He is bringing a friend--a school and college
friend--in a bank in London now--rather genteel, I believe. Well,
Dr Grainger said to me this evening: "You know my friend is
<i>very</i> circumspect, <i>very</i> circumspect, so you won't be
surprised if my behaviour is rather different this evening."</p>

<p>ADA: Oh indeed!</p>

<p>EMILY: You should have kept him more in his place, Annie.</p>

<p>ANNIE: I should, but I thought he was a gentleman. I don't
know <i>how</i> we're going to receive them this evening.</p>

<p>EMILY: We need simply take no notice of him, and be just
polite.</p>

<p>ANNIE: But we don't know what he may have told his friend
about us.</p>

<p>EMILY: I never cared for him.</p>

<p>ADA: Oh, what ripping fun!</p>

<p>ANNIE: Ada, be careful what you do and say.</p>

<p>ADA: It's not I who've put my foot in it. It is you if
anyone.</p>

<p>ANNIE: I have been too free, perhaps; but you cannot say I
have put my foot in it. I wish I had never admitted Dr Grainger
at all--but he came with Jack--</p>

<p>EMILY: We shall go through alright with it. Simply despise Dr
Grainger.</p>

<p>ANNIE: He is despicable.</p>

<p>ADA: He is here.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Emily, will you go downstairs and receive them? ADA,
you stay here.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> EMILY--<i>voices downstairs.</i></p>

<p>ADA: They are all three here--I must go also.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> ADA.</p>

<p>ANNIE CALLADINE <i>straightens her hair before the mirror,
rubs out her wrinkles, puts her flowers nicely, and seats herself
with much composure. Enter</i> GRAINGER <i>and</i> BRENTNALL,
<i>followed by</i> ADA CALLADINE.</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>stiffly</i>): Miss Annie Calladine--Mr
Brentnall.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What a nice smell of flowers.</p>

<p>ANNIE: It is the mezereon that Mr Magneer brought.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Did Mr Magneer bring flowers? I shouldn't have
thought the idea could occur to him.</p>

<p>ANNIE: He always brings flowers from the <i>garden.</i> It
would never occur to him to buy them for us.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I see--how nice of him.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: All country fellows cart handfuls of flowers that
they've got out of their own gardens, to their girls.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Nevertheless, Mr Magneer does it nicely.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> MAGNEER <i>and</i> EMILY.</p>

<p>JACK: Now we seem as if we're going to be alright. What do you
say, George?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I say the same.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Do take a seat, all of you. Jack, you love the
couch--</p>

<p>JACK: It's a very nice couch, this is. (<i>Sits down.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I should think it would be the easiest thing in
life to write a poem about a couch. I wonder if the woman was
giving Cowper a gentle hint--</p>

<p>ADA (<i>shrieking with laughter</i>): Yes--yes--yes!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I never see a couch but my heart moves to poetry.
The very buttons must be full of echoes--</p>

<p>JACK (<i>bending his ear</i>): Can't hear 'em, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Will none of you tune his ear?</p>

<p>ADA: Yes--yes!</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>seating herself quietly beside</i> JACK): What is it
you are listening for, Jack?</p>

<p>JACK (<i>awkwardly</i>): I've no idea.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Where will you sit, Mr Brentnall? Do choose a
comfortable chair.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>seating himself beside her</i>): Thanks very
much.</p>

<p>JACK: Nay--nay--nay, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>rising suddenly</i>): Er--there's a broken
spring in that chair, Miss Calladine. (<i>He crosses the
hearth.</i>)</p>

<p>ANNIE: I'm so sorry--have a cushion--do!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Will you allow me to sit here?</p>

<p>ADA: Let me give you some supper.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Shall I administer the drinks?</p>

<p>GRAINGER <i>gives the women burgundy, the men whisky and
soda.</i> ADA CALLADINE <i>hands round food.</i> GRAINGER
<i>seats himself reluctantly beside</i> ANNIE CALLADINE--ADA
CALLADINE <i>takes a low chair next to</i> BRENTNALL.</p>

<p>JACK: Now we are alright--at least I hope so.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>to</i> ADA): You are quite alright?</p>

<p>ADA (<i>laughing</i>): As far as I know.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>to</i> EMILY): I can see you are perfectly at
home. (EMILY <i>bows quietly, with a smile.</i>) And you, Miss
Calladine?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Thank you!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Gentlemen--the ladies!</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>ironically</i>): God bless 'em.</p>

<p>JACK: Amen! (<i>They drink.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA: Ladies--the gentlemen!</p>

<p>ANNIE: God help them.</p>

<p>EMILY: Amen! (<i>They drink.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Wherein must the Lord help us, Miss Calladine?</p>

<p>ANNIE: To run away, Mr Brentnall.</p>

<p>EMILY: Annie!</p>

<p>ADA: To come to the scratch, you mean.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Ha! Gentlemen--to marriage!</p>

<p>JACK: I don't think!</p>

<p>ANNIE: What is <i>your</i> comment, Dr Grainger?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Mine!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Dr Grainger is a confirmed misogynist.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Shut up, you fool.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Oh--we've not heard so before.</p>

<p>JACK: D'you mean George doesn't believe in marriage? Nay,
you're wrong there. When th' time comes--</p>

<p>ANNIE: When <i>does</i> the time come for a man to marry,
Jack?</p>

<p>JACK: When he can't help it, I s'd think.
(<i>Silence.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You're very quiet, George.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Don't you be a fool.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Your humour is not very complimentary this evening, Dr
Grainger.</p>

<p>JACK: There's perhaps too many of us in th' room, eh?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Not too many for me, Jack.</p>

<p>ADA (<i>bursting into laughter</i>): Do be complimentary,
somebody, if only to cheer us up.</p>

<p>JACK (<i>putting his arm round</i> EMILY'S <i>waist</i>): Yis,
I will.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>putting his arm round</i> ADA'S <i>neck</i>):
May I kiss you, Ada?</p>

<p>ADA (<i>laughing</i>): How (<i>laughs</i>)--how awfully nice
(<i>laughs heartily</i>) of you. (BRENTNALL <i>kisses
her.</i>)</p>

<p>JACK: Oh my God, now we're coming on. (<i>He kisses</i> EMILY
<i>furtively.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Mind your own business.</p>

<p><i>Seizes a newspaper, and screens it before him and</i>
ADA--<i>they put their heads together.</i></p>

<p>JACK: I call that comin' on--eh what?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>to</i> ADA--<i>behind the newspaper</i>): Well,
I'll be damned!</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>loudly and sarcastically</i>): Do you like the
flavour, Mr Brentnall?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>from behind the paper</i>): Excellent! (<i>Sotto
voce.</i>)You are awfully jolly.</p>

<p>JACK (<i>bouncing with surprise</i>): Well strike me
lucky!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>throwing him another newspaper</i>): Here you
are then!</p>

<p>JACK: Good God! (<i>He spreads the paper before him and</i>
EMILY.)</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You damn fool, Billy Brentnall.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Dog in the manger. (<i>Softly to</i> ADA.) Do you
think I'm a fool? No, you like me.</p>

<p>JACK (<i>from behind his paper</i>): How're you going on,
Billy?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Fine. How're you going on, George?</p>

<p><i>The four peep over their newspapers at</i> GRAINGER
<i>and</i> ANNIE.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Temperature down at freezing point over there?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I'll have it out of you for this, William.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Why, what has Mr Brentnall done amiss, Dr Grainger?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>from behind his paper</i>): Oh, it's not I. It's
George's sins finding him out. Be sure your sins will find you
out.</p>

<p>ADA (<i>softly</i>): You're not a bit what I thought you would
be.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>softly</i>): Worse or better?</p>

<p>ADA (<i>laughing</i>): Oh--better.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What did you think I should be?</p>

<p>ADA: Circumspect.</p>

<p>GRAINGER <i>sends a cushion smashing through their
paper.</i></p>

<p>JACK: What the devil's up, George?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Oh, it annoys him to see other people enjoying
themselves when he can't.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>spreading the paper for screen</i>): The nail on
the head, Miss--may I say Annie?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Yes, Mr Brentnall.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I wish I were two men, Annie.</p>

<p>GRAINGER <i>sends the cushion again smashing through the
newspaper.</i></p>

<p>JACK: God help thee George, do settle down.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>spreading the paper again</i>): It's high time
he did--settle down, Georgie--it's good advice.</p>

<p>ADA (<i>softly</i>): What makes him so cross to-night?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>softly</i>): Don't know--unless he's shy.</p>

<p>ADA (<i>bursting with laughter</i>): Shy!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Why, isn't he?</p>

<p>ADA: You should see the way he carries on--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: With you?</p>

<p>ADA: Annie.</p>

<p><i>The cushion crashes through the paper.</i></p>

<p>JACK: Damn thee George, take Annie downstairs a minute, if tha
can't bide still.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: That fool there--!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>restoring the fragments of
paper</i>--<i>softly</i>--to ADA): You know there's a secret
about Dr Grainger.</p>

<p>ADA: Oh! (<i>Laughs.</i>) Do tell me.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Billy Brentnall!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I hear you calling me.</p>

<p>ADA: Do tell me the secret.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Kiss me then. (<i>They kiss--she
laughs.</i>) You are awfully jolly. (<i>Kisses her under the
ear.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA (<i>shaking with laughter</i>): Don't, don't, oh
don't!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Does my moustache tickle you? Sorry.</p>

<p>JACK: Nation seize me, did ever you hear?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Such a fool? I'll bet you never did.</p>

<p>ADA: Tell me that secret.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: George has got another girl.</p>

<p>ADA: Who? Where?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Oh, cheese it, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Sally Magneer.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Damn you.</p>

<p>ADA: No!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Fact! She told me herself.</p>

<p>JACK: What's that, George?</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>to</i> BRENTNALL): Liar!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: It's the truth--mine's pistols.</p>

<p>JACK: You're a devil, George, you're a devil.</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>bitterly</i>): I am that!</p>

<p>EMILY: And what is Mr Brentnall?</p>

<p>JACK (<i>shaking his head</i>): Nay, I'm not going to say.
(<i>He rises heavily, draws</i> EMILY <i>after him, and goes out
of the room.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>rising</i>): Well, this newspaper's no more
good.</p>

<p>ADA: There's a fire in the drawing-room--and real screens
there.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And Jack <i>does</i> occupy <i>himself.</i> Right
you are.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Chuck it, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: None o' that.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Well, I'll go to--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I've no doubt.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Dr Grainger is afraid of being left alone: he must have
someone to protect him.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What from?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Presumably from me. (<i>To</i> GRAINGER.) Will you go
down with Ada to the drawing-room? Ada, do you mind?</p>

<p>ADA: Not at all. (<i>Exit</i> ADA.)</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>bitterly</i>): Very nice of you, Annie, very nice
of you. (<i>Exit</i> GRAINGER.)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL <i>and</i> ANNIE <i>seat themselves.</i></p>

<p>ANNIE: What do you think of all this, Mr Brentnall?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Why, it's a mere lark. Jack is really courting
Emily, and Ada is sheer mischief, and I'm quite decent,
really.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Are you really?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Judge from your own instinct.</p>

<p>ANNIE: I think you are--and is Dr Grainger?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What do you think?</p>

<p>ANNIE: There is something not nice about him.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Has he been courting you?</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>drawing herself up</i>): Well--!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You see, it's a pity--</p>

<p>ANNIE: What is a pity?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Why--shall I say just what I think--?</p>

<p>ANNIE: I want you to.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Well then--it's a pity that girls like you--you are
over thirty?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Yes.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: It's a pity that so many of the best women let
their youth slip by, because they don't find a man good
enough--and then, when dissatisfaction becomes a torture--later
on--you are dissatisfied with life, you <i>do</i> lack something
big.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Yes.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: When it comes to that stage, the want of a man is a
torture to you. And since the common men make the advances--</p>

<p>ANNIE: Yes!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>putting his arm round her and kissing her</i>):
You are either driven to a kind of degradation, or you go nearly,
slightly mad from want--</p>

<p>ANNIE: Yes!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>kissing her</i>): If you want love from men like
Grainger, take it for what it's worth--because we're made so that
either we must have love, or starve and go slightly mad.</p>

<p>ANNIE: But I don't want that kind of love.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: But do be honest with yourself. Don't cause a split
between your conscious self and your unconscious--that is
insanity. You <i>do</i> want love, almost any sort. Make up your
mind what you'll accept, or what you won't, but keep your ideal
intact. Whatever men you take, keep the idea of man intact: let
your soul wait whether your body does or not. But don't drag the
first down to the second. Do you understand?</p>

<p>ANNIE: I could love you.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: But I am going away in a day or two, and most
probably shall not be here again--and I am engaged. You see, so
many women are too good for the men, that for every decent man,
there are thirty decent women. And you decent women go and waste
and wither away. Do think it out square, and make the best of it.
Virginity and all that is no good to you.</p>

<p>ANNIE: And what would you advise?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Know men, and have men, if you must. But keep your
soul virgin, wait and believe in the <i>good</i> man you may
never have.</p>

<p>ANNIE: It is not very--what made Dr Grainger so queer
to-night?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Because he's married.</p>

<p>ANNIE: I <i>felt</i> it--to whom?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: A girl in Wolverhampton--married last January, a
son in March, now it's June.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Oh, the liar!--And what sort of girl?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Decent, I believe.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Does she love him?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Yes.</p>

<p>ANNIE: The brute--the--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: He doesn't love her, you see--</p>

<p>ANNIE: It makes it no better--and she doesn't know how
he's--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Of course not.</p>

<p>ANNIE: I wonder if I know her--what's her name?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Marson--her people are tailors in Broad Street.</p>

<p>ANNIE: No, I don't know her!--But to think--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Don't be too ready to blame.</p>

<p>ANNIE: You men are all alike.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Not true--who is coming?</p>

<p>ANNIE: I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> SALLY MAGNEER--<i>a very big, strapping farmer's
daughter, evidently moderately well off.</i></p>

<p>SALLY: Good evening--Jack here?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Good evening. Yes, I believe he's in the drawing-room
with Dr Grainger.</p>

<p>SALLY: That's how you arrange it, is it? (<i>To</i>
BRENTNALL.) Nice, isn't it?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Very nice.</p>

<p>SALLY: Who else is in the drawing-room?</p>

<p>ANNIE: My sisters. I believe they're having some music.</p>

<p>SALLY: They don't make much noise over it, anyway. Can I go
and see?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Certainly.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL <i>opens the door for her, and whistles quickly a
private call</i>--<i>repeats it.</i> GRAINGER'S <i>whistle is
heard in answer.</i></p>

<p>SALLY: Alright, I won't drop in on you too sudden.
(<i>Exit</i> SALLY.)</p>

<p>ANNIE: What impertinence!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>laughing</i>): She's made a dead set at
Grainger. If he weren't married, she'd get him.</p>

<p>ANNIE: How disgusting!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Maybe--but a woman who determines soon enough to
get married, succeeds. Delay is fatal--and marriage is beastly,
on most occasions.</p>

<p>ANNIE: I will go to the drawing-room. Will you excuse me?
(<i>Exit</i> ANNIE. BRENTNALL <i>pours himself a drink. Enter</i>
GRAINGER.)</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What the hell have you been up to?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What the hell have you been up to?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What have you been stuffing into Annie?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What have you been stuffing into Ada?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Nothing, you devil.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Nothing, you devil.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What's Sally after?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: She ought to be shot.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: So ought you.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> JACK.</p>

<p>JACK: What the hell's up to-night?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: My tail, and George's dander, and your--but what's
Miss Magneer after?</p>

<p>JACK: That's what I want to know. You know George here, he's a
devil. He's been on wi' some little game with our Sally.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You sweet liar, Jack.</p>

<p>JACK: Now George, what is it?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Nothing, Jack. Sally's taken a fancy to me, an'
gives me no chance. Can't you see for yourself?</p>

<p>JACK: I can, George--an' tha shanner be pestered.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: There's Charlie Greenhalgh won't speak to me
now--thinks I'm running him off. <i>I've</i> no desire to run
Charlie off.</p>

<p>JACK: Sally's as good as you, George.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Maybe, and a thousand times better. But that doesn't
say as I want to marry her.</p>

<p>JACK: No, George, no, that is so, lad.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> SALLY <i>and the other ladies.</i></p>

<p>SALLY: How would you arrange six folks in three chairs--?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Couldn't do it.</p>

<p>SALLY: I don't think! What's your opinion, Ada?</p>

<p>ADA: Why am I asked for my opinion? I've never sat in a chair
with Dr Grainger.</p>

<p>SALLY: Where have you sat then?</p>

<p>ADA: I may have sat on his knee while he sat in the chair.</p>

<p>SALLY: Here, young man, explain yourself.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well, I'll be damned!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Sooner or later.</p>

<p>JACK: Now look here, our Sally, we're havin' none o' this.
Charlie Greenhalgh is your man; you stick to him, and leave other
young fellows alone.</p>

<p>SALLY: Oh you <i>are</i> good, Jack! And what about the girl
<i>you</i> took to Blackpool?</p>

<p>JACK: Say no more, Sally, now say no more.</p>

<p>SALLY: No, I won't. Do you want me to drive you up to Selson,
because th' cart's at the door?</p>

<p>JACK: No, we'll walk up.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I dunno, Jack. It's getting late, and I believe
Billy's tired. He's a convalescent, you know.</p>

<p>JACK: Never thought of it, lad. Sorry--sorry.</p>

<p><i>They bid good night. Exeunt</i> SALLY <i>and</i> GRAINGER,
EMILY, JACK, <i>and</i> ADA.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Isn't he a thing!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: He's not bad--<i>do</i> be honest.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Oh <i>but!</i></p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Remember what I say--don't starve yourself, and
don't degrade the idea of men.</p>

<p>ANNIE: And shall I never see you again?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: If I can, I will come again.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Good-bye.</p>

<p><i>He kisses her rather sorrowfully, and departs.</i> ANNIE
CALLADINE <i>closes the door</i>--<i>drinks the last drain
from his glass</i>--<i>weeps</i>--<i>dries her eyes as the
girls come upstairs. There is a calling of good-bye from
outside.</i></p>

<p>ADA: What's amiss?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Plenty.</p>

<p>EMILY: What?</p>

<p>ANNIE: Dr Grainger is only married and got a child.</p>

<p>ADA and EMILY: No--where--is his wife living?</p>

<p>ANNIE: His wife is at her home, in Wolverhampton--Broad
Street.</p>

<p>ADA: I'll write to her--I will--I will.</p>

<p>ANNIE: No, Ada--no.</p>

<p>ADA: I will--I will--I will: "Dear Mrs George Grainger, come
and look after your husband. He is running the rig out here, and
if you don't come quick--"</p>

<p><i>She has flung her writing case on to the table, and sits
down to write. Vain cries of "Ada," "Ada," from</i> ANNIE
CALLADINE.</p>

EMILY CALLADINE, ADA CALLADINE. MR MAGNEER, <i>farmer, not fat,
but well looking</i>: <i>grey hair, black moustache; at present
rather maudlin.</i> JACK MAGNEER, <i>still in riding breeches and
leggings.</i> GRAINGER <i>and</i> BRENTNALL, <i>both in tennis
flannels.</i> JACK <i>and</i> EMILY <i>sit together on a large

</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: An' so you really goin' ter leave us, Dr
Grainger.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: That is so, Mr Magneer.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: An' when might you be goin'?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Saturday.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: To-morrow! My word, that's sharp. Well, I know
<i>one</i> as'll be sorry you goin'.</p>

<p>SALLY: Shut up, Father. (<i>She giggles, and twists her
handkerchief to</i> GRAINGER.) We s'll be seeing you again,
though?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well, I really can't say--I'm going to London.</p>

<p>SALLY: London! Whatever are you going there for?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Set up a wife and family.</p>

<p>SALLY: What, all at once?--Give us a chance.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Not a ghost of a chance, Sally.</p>

<p>ADA CALLADINE <i>laughs uncontrollably.</i></p>

<p>GRAINGER: Got a joke over there?</p>

<p>ADA (<i>laughing</i>): Yes--yes--yes!</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>jumping up</i>): Just look at your glass!
(<i>Takes</i> GRAINGER'S <i>tumbler and proceeds to mix him
rum.</i>) Why ever didn't you speak?</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Yes, you must shout up when you're emp'y.</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>to</i> GRAINGER): Like it sweet?</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>ironically</i>): Not too much.</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>taking the glass and standing in front of him</i>):
How's this for you?</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>sipping</i>): Quite alright, thank you,
Sally.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER (<i>laughing</i>): "Quite alright," hark ye! It's
"quite alright." (<i>He gives a great wink at</i> BRENTNALL.
SALLY <i>begins to giggle.</i>)</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>lugubriously</i>): Sally's got 'em again.</p>

<p>JACK: Sit you down, Sally, an' don't look so long o' th'
leg.</p>

<p>SALLY <i>giggles half hysterically, and sinks beside</i>
GRAINGER, <i>who edges away. She leans towards him</i>--<i>laughs
uncontrollably.</i></p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Now we're comin' on. What yer doin' at 'er,
Doctor?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Begad, I'm doing nothing, Mr Magneer. I dunno what's
got her.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER (<i>laughs</i>): He dunno, doesn't know what's got
her. (<i>To</i> BRENTNALL.) We don't, do we?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Not a bit.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I'll have a drop more water. (<i>Rises and goes to
table.</i>)</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Come Sally, my lass, come.</p>

<p>SALLY <i>dries her eyes, still giggles, rises.</i> GRAINGER
<i>hastily takes an odd chair at the table. She stands beside
him.</i></p>

<p>JACK: Are ter goin' ter sit thysen down, Sally?</p>

<p>SALLY: Am I hurtin' <i>you</i> by standin'?</p>

<p>JACK: Yis, you are.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Fill me up, Sally, there's a dear. (SALLY <i>takes
his glass.</i>)</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Sally Magneer, there's a dear.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Isn't Charlie coming?</p>

<p>SALLY: No, did you want him?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No--but I thought <i>you</i> did.</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>beginning to giggle</i>): Did you? You happen
thought wrong.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Poor Charlie.</p>

<p>SALLY: What do you know about him?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Now Sally! It's best to be on with the new love
before you're off with the old.</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>giggling</i>): I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p>JACK: Art thou going to sit down?</p>

<p>SALLY: Yes. (<i>Retires discomfited to the couch.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>rising</i>): I'll get a light.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Matches?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>going to fire</i>): Never mind. (<i>Lights his
cigarette with a spill.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA (<i>laughing</i>): Good-bye, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>blowing her kisses</i>): Farewell, farewell.
(<i>Sinks on the couch beside</i> SALLY.)</p>

<p>SALLY: What have you come for?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Won't you have me, Sally?</p>

<p>SALLY: I don't know.</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>shuffling the cards</i>): A hand of crib, Mr
Magneer?</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: I don't mind if I do. Fill up.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>taking</i> SALLY'S <i>hand</i>): Hurt your
finger?</p>

<p>SALLY: My thumb.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Shame! What did you do?</p>

<p>SALLY: Chopped it.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: How rotten. Is it getting better?</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: There's a bit o' proud flesh in it.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Your crib, Mr Magneer.</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>unwinding the bandage</i>): Yes, it's going on
alright now.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>examining it closely</i>): Yes, that's healing
right enough, but a nasty gash! What did Charlie say to it?</p>

<p>SALLY: Charlie!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Yes, Charlie. He's your fellow, isn't he?</p>

<p>SALLY: I don't know so much about that.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I heard you were as good as engaged.</p>

<p>SALLY: Oh, did you--who's been telling you?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Mrs Plum.</p>

<p>SALLY: She knows so much, you see.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Let me wrap it up for you. (<i>Bandages her
thumb.</i>) But isn't it right?</p>

<p>SALLY: Not as <i>I</i> know of.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>SALLY: Who are you sorry for?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Charlie, of course, poor devil.</p>

<p>SALLY: You needn't be sorry for him. Take your sorrow where
your love lies.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Then I s'll have to be sorry for you, Sally.</p>

<p>SALLY: I <i>don't</i> think.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>putting his arm round her waist</i>): I'm sorry
you've got a bad finger, Sally.</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>beginning to giggle</i>): Are you?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You don't mind that I'm not Dr Grainger, do you,
Sally?</p>

<p>SALLY: What do you mean?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You'd as leave have me as Dr Grainger?</p>

<p>SALLY: Yes, if you like.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>kissing her</i>): That's right. (<i>She
giggles.</i>)</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Whey! Whey--up! Sally, thou scawdrag!</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>giggling hysterically</i>): What am I a scawdrag
for?</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Hark ye, hark ye! Jack, art takin' notice over
there?</p>

<p>JACK: Billy's alright, Dad.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Billy? By gosh! Billy!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Turn, Mr Magneer.</p>

<p>ADA (<i>pegging</i>): Two for his knobs.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You'd as leave have me as Dr Grainger? (<i>Kisses
her under the ear.</i>)</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>with suppressed shrieks</i>): Oh, oh, don't
tickle!</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>turning around</i>--<i>with contempt</i>): She'll
never stop, Billy, she's got gigglemania.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Giggolo--what? That's a good 'un!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Yes, she will stop--take me seriously, Sally,
do!</p>

<p>(<i>Squeezes her--</i>SALLY <i>giggles wildly. Her head
rolls.</i>)</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Hark at that--take him seriously!</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>exhausted</i>): Don't! Don't! Oh don't!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Sally, my dear, you are too discouraging for
anything. Sit with me nicely.</p>

<p>SALLY: Oh! (<i>Lays her head on his shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Now we're coming on. (<i>Kisses her.</i>) You've
not chipped with Charlie, have you?</p>

<p>SALLY: What d'you want to know for?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Sally, my darling.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Gosh, it's come to "darling"--"darling Sally"!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You haven't, have you?</p>

<p>SALLY: No.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Why hasn't he come to-night?</p>

<p>SALLY: Because he wasn't asked.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Has he cooled off lately?</p>

<p>SALLY: I don't care whether he has or not.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Neither do I. (<i>Kisses her under the ear. She
squeals.</i>)</p>

<p>JACK: God love you, Sally!</p>

<p>ADA: Don't play cribbage any more, Mr Magneer. Do play the
comb-band.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER (<i>throwing away his cards</i>): No, I won't play
any more. Fill up an' let's have a dance.</p>

<p>ADA: Yes, yes, yes!</p>

<p><i>The men drink</i>--SALLY <i>and</i> GRAINGER <i>push aside
the table.</i></p>

<p>GRAINGER: Comb-band, Mr Magneer?</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER (<i>wrapping the comb in tissue paper</i>): That's
the very item. (<i>He staggers slightly</i>--<i>all the men are
affected by drink.</i>)</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>to</i> GRAINGER): You're going to have one with
me?</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>awkwardly</i>): Er--I'd promised Ada.</p>

<p>ADA: That doesn't matter. Mr Brentnall will dance with me.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER (<i>sounding the comb</i>): Now then, are you
ready? Sally's the belle of the ball, and you, Doctor, it's your
party--so lead off.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Polka--plain polka.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: We shan't have breath to speak a word.</p>

<p>SALLY: Oh my goodness!</p>

<p><i>The comb-band buzzes away</i>--<i>they start to dance in a
prancing fashion.</i></p>

<p>SALLY: You're not going to leave me?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I s'll have to.</p>

<p>SALLY: But you can't.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Why not?</p>

<p>SALLY: You can't leave me now.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: But I've got to go to London--</p>

<p>JACK: Do you reckon you're really fond of me?</p>

<p>EMILY: I know I am--I don't reckon.</p>

<p>JACK: Not so very good--</p>

<p>EMILY: Why not?</p>

<p>JACK: Do you reckon you've been nice to me all this while?</p>

<p>EMILY: All what while?</p>

<p>JACK: While I've been coming to see you.</p>

<p>EMILY: And have you been very nice to me, Jack?</p>

<p>JACK: Well, haven't I?</p>

<p>EMILY: No, Jack, you haven't.</p>

<p>JACK: What do you mean?</p>

<p>ADA: I posted her the letter yesterday.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Why, did you know the address?</p>

<p>ADA: Yes, you told Annie.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Did I? Oh Lord, you little imp.</p>

<p>ADA: It's our turn now.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Whose turn?</p>

<p>ADA: The women's.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Don't be a vixen--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well, you won't say anything, will you? You see how
I'm fixed.</p>

<p>SALLY: I don't know.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I'll see you to-morrow--keep it back till then.</p>

<p>SALLY: You'll see me to-morrow?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Yes--</p>

<p>JACK: You think I ought to get engaged to you?</p>

<p>EMILY: Or else you ought never to have come as you have--you
had the option.</p>

<p>JACK: I dunna want to get married, somehow, Emily.</p>

<p>EMILY: Is that final, Jack?</p>

<p>JACK: What do <i>you</i> say?</p>

<p>EMILY: You leave me nothing to say.</p>

<p>JACK: Good God, Emily, I'm not a brute.</p>

<p>EMILY: I've heard you say so often, Jack. But you don't think
it's been very happy for me--our--our friendship?</p>

<p>JACK: Good God, Emily--have I been--?</p>

<p>EMILY: Afraid of me, Jack. It's rather humiliating.</p>

<p>JACK: You can have me if you like--I'm not good enough--</p>

<p>EMILY: You know I consider you good enough.</p>

<p>JACK: Yis--I know you do.</p>

<p>EMILY: Men lack honour nowadays.</p>

<p>JACK: Good God!</p>

<p><i>They dance</i>--SALLY <i>suddenly drops exhausted on a
couch</i>--GRAINGER <i>moves to the other side of the room.
JACK</i> MAGNEER <i>flings off his coat.</i></p>

<p>JACK: By the Lord, it's hot work! Take your coat off,
George.</p>

<p>GRAINGER <i>and</i> BRENTNALL <i>take off their coats.</i></p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: My word, you went well. Have a drink.</p>

<p>SALLY: Is th' door open? Set the back door open, Jack.</p>

<p><i>He goes out and returns.</i></p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Have the next with me, Sally.</p>

<p>SALLY: I will if you like.</p>

<p>ADA: What shall it be?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Waltz Valeta.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Try a tune, Mr Magneer.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER, <i>having repapered his comb, tries a tune.</i>
GRAINGER <i>instructs him. They start</i> off, SALLY <i>with</i>
BRENTNALL, GRAINGER <i>with</i> ADA CALLADINE.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Why would you rather dance with Dr Grainger?</p>

<p>SALLY: I wouldn't.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Yes, you would. Don't forget the two shuffle
steps--one--two!</p>

<p>SALLY: I've never done that before.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Something I've taught you then. But why would you
rather dance with Grainger?</p>

<p>SALLY: I <i>wouldn't.</i></p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You <i>would.</i></p>

<p>SALLY: I <i>wouldn't.</i></p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You <i>would.</i> You're in love with him.</p>

<p>SALLY: Me! That I never am!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You are!</p>

<p>SALLY: Well, I never did!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And you're a fool to be in love with him.</p>

<p>SALLY: Why?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: For the best of all reasons.</p>

<p>SALLY: What's that?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Because he's married.</p>

<p>SALLY: He's not!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: He is--and has got a son.</p>

<p>SALLY: Where?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: In Wolverhampton, where he came from.</p>

<p>SALLY: Oh, let's sit down.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: No, you must dance with me. Don't you like to dance
with me? It's too bad, Sally.</p>

<p>SALLY: I'm getting dizzy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You can't, not in Valeta. Besides, we'll walk the
waltz steps. (<i>He puts his arm around her.</i>)</p>

<p>SALLY: It's not right about Dr Grainger, is it?</p>

<p>A LADY <i>in motor cloak and wrap appears in the doorway. The
men, slightly tipsy, bend talking to their partners, who are
engrossed. No one notices the newcomer.</i></p>

<p>BRENTNALL: It is, on my honour. You believe me, Sally?</p>

<p><i>She looks him earnestly in the face, as they dance the
forward step. When they come together for the waltz, he kisses
her.</i></p>

<p>You believe me?</p>

<p>SALLY (<i>almost in tears</i>): Yes.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: It is true. Poor Sally. (<i>Kisses her again. They
begin to laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>JACK: Alright, I niver looked at it in that light.</p>

<p>EMILY: I know you didn't.</p>

<p>JACK: We'll count as we're engaged from now, then?</p>

<p>EMILY: What will your father say?</p>

<p>JACK: He'll be just fussy.</p>

<p>EMILY: I want him to know--I am so fond of him.</p>

<p>ADA: Oh!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What?</p>

<p><i>They break apart.</i> JACK <i>and</i> BRENTNALL <i>keep on
dancing, the latter kissing</i> SALLY. GRAINGER <i>goes
unsteadily to the doorway.</i></p>

<p>THE LADY: I called to see Mr Brentnall--but don't disturb him,
he looks so happy.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Does--does he know you?</p>

<p>THE LADY: A little. (<i>She laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Billy! Billy!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>looking up</i>): What now? (<i>Sees the
lady.</i>) No!</p>

<p><i>He leaves</i> SALLY--<i>she sways, he catches her again,
takes her to a seat, draws his fingers across her cheek
caressingly, and goes to the doorway, reeling slightly.</i></p>

<p>Quite giddy, don't you know! Space is so small.</p>

<p>THE LADY: Not much room for you to spread out, was there?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Was I hugging Sally?</p>

<p>THE LADY: Sally! How lovely, how perfectly lovely!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Did I kiss her?</p>

<p>THE LADY: "Did I kiss her?" No, no, you poor dear, you didn't
kiss her.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You mean I am drunk.</p>

<p>THE LADY: Are you drunk? No!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I am slightly tipsy, more with dancing than drink.
Shall I come away?</p>

<p>THE LADY: Shall he come away--oh, you dear! Why should I
decide for you?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Are you cross?</p>

<p>THE LADY: Not in the least. Go and kiss Sally if you will.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Poor Sally--I don't want to kiss her now.</p>

<p>THE LADY: How perfectly lovely! Do introduce me.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Mr Magneer, Sally Magneer, Emily Calladine, Ada
Calladine, Jack Magneer, Dr Grainger--all of you, Elsa Smith.</p>

<p>ELSA: How awfully nice! Can I come in?</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER (<i>springing up and bowing tipsily</i>): Make
yourself at 'ome, you're very welcome, Miss, you're very
welcome.</p>

<p>ELSA: Thank you so much! I should love to dance. I've got two
friends in the motor car. May I fetch them?</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Anybody you like, they're <i>all</i> welcome here,
and there's plenty to drink for all.</p>

<p>ELSA: So nice!</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> ELSA.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Who the devil--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: My betrothed, my fianc&eacute;e, my girl.</p>

<p>CHORUS OF WOMEN: You don't mean it!</p>

<p>SALLY: Well! Men--!</p>

<p>ADA: <i>Men?</i></p>

<p>EMILY: <i>Men!</i></p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Ooh--you're done this time, Billy!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well, you devil, Billy Brentnall!</p>

<p>JACK: It's a corker, Billy, it's a winder.</p>

<p>EMILY: Are <i>you</i> any better, Jack?</p>

<p>JACK (<i>fiercely</i>): Look here, Dad. I'm engaged to Emily
here, fair and square.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Come here, Em'ler my ducky, come hither. (EMILY
<i>goes very reluctantly. He kisses her.</i>) I like thee,
Em'ler, I like thee. (<i>Kisses her again.</i>)</p>

<p>JACK: Cheese it, Dad.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: It's a winder, it is an' all.--An' aren't
<i>you</i> goin' to be engaged an' all, Dr Grainger?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Not this time.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Hm! 'Appen you are engaged!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No, I'm not.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Come then, come then, come then.</p>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> ELSA SMITH, <i>with a lady and
gentleman.</i></p>

<p>ELSA: All of you--Gladys and Tom. Gladys--That's Will--</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Ay, ay, Billy! Billy! (<i>It amuses him
highly.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>bowing</i>): I was to come to dinner to-night, I
clean forgot. Don't be angry.</p>

<p>TOM: Cheek, if no more.</p>

<p>ELSA: Oh, you don't know Will, you don't.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: An <i>you</i> don't know Billy, Miss, it strikes
me. (<i>Laughter</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Leave me alone--I say, Elsa, Jack (<i>pointing</i>)
has just got engaged to Emily.</p>

<p>ELSA: How perfectly charming. I love it all so much.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What?</p>

<p>ELSA: You--this.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Take your cloak off.</p>

<p><i>Helps her. She is a handsome woman, large, blonde, about
30</i>--<i>dressed for dinner. Tom and Gladys
disrobe</i>--<i>they are in dinner dress also.</i></p>

<p>TOM (<i>cynically</i>): I suppose these are adventures.</p>

<p>GLADYS: Don't be a fool, Tom.</p>

<p>ELSA: This is fun.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Will you dance with me, Elsa?</p>

<p>ELSA: No, I won't.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Angry with me?</p>

<p>ELSA: No. I can dance with you any day.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: May I have the pleasure?</p>

<p>ELSA: No--forgive me (<i>very kindly</i>)--but I do want to
dance with Jack. (<i>To</i> EMILY.) May I?</p>

<p>EMILY: Certainly. (JACK <i>pulls a face.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA: He doesn't want me--but I won't let him off--no.</p>

<p>JACK: I'm shy, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>ELSA: How lovely!</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER (<i>to</i> GLADYS): Now Miss, you choose.</p>

<p>GLADYS: Will, you must dance with me.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>going to her side</i>): <i>You</i> are shy.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Now Ada, your turn to pick.</p>

<p>ADA <i>looks wickedly at</i> TOM--<i>he bows.</i></p>

<p>TOM: Thank you.</p>

<p>ADA: Are you shy? (<i>She</i> <i>laughs wickedly.</i>)</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Now for Dr Grainger. (<i>He holds his fists to</i>
EMILY.) Which of 'em? (EMILY <i>touches the right fist.</i>)
Wrong! (<i>Showing a coin in his left.</i>) Sally gets him.</p>

<p>SALLY: Sally doesn't.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Come on, Sally.</p>

<p>MR MAGNEER: Now then, what is it?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Waltz.</p>

<p><i>The comb begins to buzz</i>--<i>the partners set off
dancing</i>--MR MAGNEER <i>breaks the time</i>--<i>they
laugh</i>--<i>he beckons</i> EMILY, <i>holds the comb in one
hand, her with the other, and dances prancingly, buzzing
breathlessly.</i></p>

<h1><a name="a04">ACT IV</a></h1>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The bedroom in the cottage, same as Act I. It is nine
o'clock in the morning.</i> GRAINGER <i>and</i> BRENTNALL <i>are
in bed.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>GRAINGER: Billy! (<i>No answer.</i>) You mean to say you're at
it yet? (<i>No</i> <i>answer.</i>) Well, I'll be damned; you're a
better sleeper even than a liar. (<i>No</i> <i>answer.</i>) Oh
strike! (<i>Shies a pillow at</i> BRENTNALL.)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What the--!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I should say so.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Dog in the manger! Go to sleep. I loathe the small
hours. Oh-h! (<i>Yawns.</i>)</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Small hours, begad! It's past nine o'clock.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>half asleep</i>): Early, frostily early.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You mean to say--! (<i>He shies the bolster,
viciously.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Don't, George! (<i>Sleeps.</i>)</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Devil! (<i>Shies slippers, one after the
other.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>sitting up suddenly</i>--<i>furious</i>): Go to
blazes! (<i>Lies down again.</i>)</p>

<p>GRAINGER: If you go to sleep again, Billy B., I'll empty the
water bottle over you--I will.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: <i>I'm</i> not asleep.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Billy!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Did you square Sally?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Eh?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No, look here, Billy--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>stretching his arms</i>): Georgie, you ought to
be dead.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I've no doubt. Billy Brentnall!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Did you square Sally?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Sally--Sally--Sally--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Chuck it, fool.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I don't know.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What d'you mean?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I told her you were a married man with a family,
and begad, you look it--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: That's not the point.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I apologize. I say to Sally: "He's a married man."
Sally says to me: "He's not." I say: "He is." Sally says: "I'm
dizzy." I say: "You might well be."</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Chuck it, do chuck it.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: It's the solemn fact. And our confab ended
there.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: It did!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: It did.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Hm!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You're going to London to my rooms, aren't you?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You say so.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Very well then--there's an end of Sally.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Why?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: She said she was coming round here.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: When?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: This morning.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Then don't get up till this afternoon, and then
belt for the station.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I've not settled up at the Surgery.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Thou bungler--has Sally really got a case against
you?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: She's got a case against <i>some</i> man or other,
and she'd prefer it to be me.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: But she must see <i>you're</i> quite a cold egg.
And has Charlie Greenhalgh really cried off?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No--at least--poor old Charlie's in a bit of a
mess.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: How?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: He was secretary to the football club--and he
falsified the balance sheet, and failed to produce about fifteen
quid.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: <i>He's</i> not in a very rosy condition for
marriage. However, old Magneer's not short of money?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: He isn't, begad!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Alright--let him work the oracle. Sally's no
fool--and she'll be just as well, married to Charlie. You say his
farm is going to the dogs. Alright, she'll shoo the dogs off.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Very nice.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I think so.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Who's that?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Dunno--get under the bed-clothes.</p>

<p><i>Sound of footsteps</i>--<i>enter</i> JACK MAGNEER.</p>

<p>JACK: Letting the day get well aired?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I don't believe in running risks through the chill,
damp air of early morning.</p>

<p>JACK: I s'd think you don't.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Take a seat.</p>

<p>JACK: So you're going to-day, George?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I am, Jack--and sorry to leave you.</p>

<p>JACK: What's this our Sally's been telling me?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Couldn't say, Jack.</p>

<p>JACK: As you're married--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And got a kid, quite right.</p>

<p>JACK: <i>Is</i> it, George?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I believe so.</p>

<p>JACK: Hm! (<i>A pause.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Well, Jack, say he has your sympathy.</p>

<p>JACK: Yis--yis--he has. But I'm not so sure--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Eh Jack, it's a hole we might any of us slip
into.</p>

<p>JACK: Seemingly. But why didn't you tell me, George?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Don't, Jack. Don't you see, I could give the whole
of that recitation. "We've been good friends, George, and you'd
no need to keep me in the dark like that. It's a false position
for me, as well as for you, etc., etc." That's what you want to
say?</p>

<p>JACK: Yis--and besides--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Well, look here, Jack, you might have done it
yourself. George was let in down at Wolverhampton--kicked out of
the town because he owned up and married the girl--hadn't either
a penny or a job--girl has a good home. Would <i>you</i> have
wanted to tell the whole story to these prating fools round
here?</p>

<p>JACK: No, I can't say as I should. But then--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Then what?</p>

<p>JACK: There's our Sally, and there's Annie--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: What about 'em?</p>

<p>JACK: He's courted 'em both--they're both up to the eyes in
love with him--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Not Annie. On the quiet, she's rather gone on
<i>me.</i> I showed George up in his true light to her.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Rotter--rotter!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And I stepped into the limelight, and the trick was
done.</p>

<p>JACK: You're a devil, Billy.--But look here, George, our
Sally--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Yes--</p>

<p>JACK: She's--she's gone a long way--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>quietly</i>): How do you mean, Jack?</p>

<p>JACK: Well, she's given up Charlie Greenhalgh--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Not quite. And you know, Jack, she really loves
Charlie, at the bottom. There's something fascinating about
George.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Damn your eyes, shut up, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: There's something fascinating about George. He
can't help it. The women melt like wax before him. They're all
over him. It's not his beauty, it's his manliness. He can't help
it.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I s'll smash you, Billy Brentnall, if you don't shut
up.</p>

<p>JACK: Yis, there's something in it, George.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: There <i>is,</i> Jack. Well, he can't help himself,
so you've got to help him. It's no good hitting him when he's
down.</p>

<p>JACK: <i>I'm</i> not hitting him.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And what you've got to do, you've got to get
Charlie Greenhalgh and your Sally together again.</p>

<p>JACK: Me!--It's nowt to do with me.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Yes, it has. Charlie's not been up to your place
lately, has he?</p>

<p>JACK: No.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And do you know why?</p>

<p>JACK: Yis.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: It's not so much because of George. Have you heard
he's fifteen quid out with the football club.</p>

<p>JACK: I've heard a whisper.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Well, you help him, Jack, for Sally's sake. She
loves him, Jack, she does. And if she married him quick, she'll
pull him through, for she seems to have a business head on her,
and a farming head.</p>

<p>JACK: She has that.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Well, you'll do what you can for poor old Charlie,
won't you?</p>

<p>JACK: I will, Billy. And what time are you going?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: 2.50 train.</p>

<p>JACK: Well--me and you's been good pals, George. I must say
I'd ha' done anything for you--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I know you would, Jack.</p>

<p>JACK: Yis, an' I would--an' I would.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I'm going up to Blythe Hall against Ashbourne for a
day or two, Jack. Shall you come up for tennis?</p>

<p>JACK: I hardly think so--we s'll be busy just now.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Sunday afternoon--yes you will.</p>

<p>JACK: Good-bye, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Au revoir, Jack.</p>

<p>JACK: Well--good-bye, George--lad. We've not done amiss while
you've been here. I s'll miss thee.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You've been alright to me, Jack.</p>

<p>JACK: Yis--I try to do what I can for folks.</p>

<p>Exit JACK.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: The atmosphere clears, George.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Oh damn you, shut up.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: "Oh, what a sin is base ingratitude!"</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What did you tell Annie about me?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I said you were quite manly, and couldn't help
yourself; all the virtues of good nature and so on, but a bit of
a libidinous goat.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Thank you--very nice of you.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Add to this that you won't face a situation, but
always funk it, and you understand why Annie suddenly transferred
her affections to me. For I showed myself, by contrast, a paragon
of all virtues.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You would.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I did.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I shan't go to London to your rooms.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Now George, my dear chap----</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I shall not, Billy.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Then where will you go?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Hell!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: My dear, dear fellow, you've neither the cash nor
the ability.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well, you're a--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Shall we get up?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I will, whether you will or not. (<i>Sits on the
side of the bed whistling "On the Banks of Allan Water".
Footsteps on the stairs</i>--<i>enter</i> GRAINGER'S <i>wife,</i>
ETHEL--<i>rather thin, with a light costume.</i>)</p>

<p>ETHEL: George! (<i>She goes forward and kisses him, not
noticing</i> BRENTNALL.) George! (<i>Sinks her head on his
shoulder.</i>) George!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Ethel--well I'm blessed! (<i>Kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>drawing away</i>): I had to come.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Yes.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Are you angry?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Me angry! What should I be angry for?</p>

<p>ETHEL: I thought you might be.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What made you come?</p>

<p>ETHEL: I heard you were going away--and your letters seemed so
constrained. Are you--?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What?</p>

<p>ETHEL: Going away?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I s'll have to--this job's done.</p>

<p>ETHEL: You never told me.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What was the good?</p>

<p>ETHEL: Where are you going?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Dunno--I don't know in the least.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Oh George, you must come home. Mother says you
must.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Hm!</p>

<p>ETHEL: Won't you?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I'd rather not.</p>

<p>ETHEL: What will you do, then?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I may--I shall probably get a job in London.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Oh George, don't, don't go to London.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What else can I do?</p>

<p>ETHEL: Come home to Mother with me.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I'll be damned if I will.</p>

<p>ETHEL: No, you never will do anything I ask you.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I shan't do that.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Don't you want to be with me?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: If I want ever so badly, I can't, with no money.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Then how are you going to live alone, with no
money?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I can manage for myself.</p>

<p>ETHEL: I know what you want, you want to run away. It is mean,
mean of you.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What's the good of my coming to <i>your</i> place,
there, where they kicked me out?</p>

<p>ETHEL: And what if you've nowhere else to go? And what are you
going to do in London?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Look for a job.</p>

<p>ETHEL: And what when you've got one?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Save up to get some things together.</p>

<p>ETHEL: How much have you saved here?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Not a fat lot--but I <i>have</i> saved.</p>

<p>ETHEL: How much?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Some--at any rate.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Have you been miserable? I know you like plenty of
life. Has it made you miserable to be tied up?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Not miserable--but it's been a bit of a devil.</p>

<p>ETHEL: We ought to live together.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: On what?</p>

<p>ETHEL: On what we can get.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No, thank you.</p>

<p>ETHEL: We might as well not be married. I believe you hate me
for having married you. Do you--do you?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Now Ethel, drop it. Don't get excited. You know I
don't feel anything of the sort.</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>weeping</i>): But you don't love me.</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>tenderly</i>): Why, I do, Ethel, I do.</p>

<p>ETHEL: I love you, George, I love you.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Poor old Ethel--and I love you. And whoever says I
don't, is a liar.</p>

<p>ETHEL: You've been true to me, George?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What do you mean?</p>

<p>ETHEL: Have you been true to me?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: No, he hasn't.</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>fiercely</i>): Now Billy!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I am your husband's old friend, Brentnall, and
<i>your</i> friend, Mrs Grainger. (<i>Gets out of bed, shakes
hands with</i> ETHEL.)</p>

<p>ETHEL: I didn't know you were there.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Never mind. (<i>Puts on a dressing-gown.</i>)</p>

<p>ETHEL: Do you say George hasn't been true to me?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I do. Do you really love him?</p>

<p>ETHEL: He is my husband.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You do love him, I can see. Then, look here,
<i>keep</i> him. You can do it, I should think. <i>Keep</i> him.
And you, George, be decent.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Be decent yourself.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I am. (<i>Lights a cigarette.</i>) You don't mind
if I smoke?</p>

<p>ETHEL: No. George, oh George! It's not true what he says, is
it?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No!</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>weeping</i>): I couldn't bear it. (<i>Embracing
him.</i>) I couldn't bear it.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>aside</i>): That's the ticket.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Never mind, little girl--never mind.</p>

<p>ETHEL: You won't leave me again?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>aside</i>): Good shot!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What can I do?</p>

<p>ETHEL: I've got seventy pounds, George, I've got seventy
pounds.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I don't want <i>your money,</i> Ethel.</p>

<p>ETHEL: You don't mind making a fool of me, and neglecting me,
but you won't have my money.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Now Ethel--</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>flashing</i>): Isn't it so?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No, Ethel.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Then we'll live together on seventy pounds, till you
get a job?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: But you see--</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>turning, flashing, to</i> BRENTNALL): <i>Has</i> he
been living straight--<i>do</i> they know here he's married?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I've told a few of them.</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>turning slowly to</i> GRAINGER): Now then--</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You can do what the hell you like.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Then I shall live with you, from this minute
onwards.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Knocked out, George!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Curse you, Brentnall.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You are a rotter, my dear fellow.</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>weeping</i>): There's baby crying.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> ETHEL, <i>weeping. BRENTNALL</i> <i>smokes a
cigarette</i>--GRAINGER <i>fumes.</i></p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>throwing him a dressing-gown</i>): You'd better
clothe yourself--you'll feel stronger.</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>getting into the dressing-gown</i>): What d'you
reckon you're up to?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: <i>Don't</i> be a fool, George, <i>don't</i> be a
swine. <i>If</i> you're going to clear out, stand up and say so
honourably! Say you'll not abide by your marriage. You <i>can</i>
do that, with decency.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: How the devil can I?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: <i>Will</i> you?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: No, damn it, how can I? I'm not a--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Very well then, you won't clear out, you won't
renounce your marriage. Very well then, go and live with the
girl, and be decent. Have a cigarette! (GRAINGER <i>takes a
cigarette.</i>)</p>

<p>GRAINGER: It's a cursed rotten hole--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Then for the Lord's sake, make it as comfortable as
possible, if you're going to stop in it.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Hark!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Sally!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: It is, begad!</p>

<p>ETHEL <i>appears.</i></p>

<p>ETHEL: There's a woman enquiring for you.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What for--what does she want?</p>

<p>ETHEL: She wants you.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Hm! Is it Sally? She's been running after me ever
since I've been here, bless her.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Let's have her up. (<i>Calling.</i>) Do come
upstairs, Miss Magneer. It's quite decent.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: It's a bit thick, Billy.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> SALLY.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>to</i> SALLY): Excuse our appearance, won't you?
How do you do? (<i>Shakes hands.</i>)</p>

<p>SALLY: How do you do?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Have you been introduced to Mrs Grainger? Mrs
Doctor Grainger--Miss Magneer.</p>

<p>SALLY: I've been given to understand this is Mrs Doctor
Grainger--and that the baby downstairs--</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Is Master Jimmy Grainger. Quite so.</p>

<p>SALLY: I think it <i>is</i> quite so. It's happened quite so,
but it's not quite the thing.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Don't let us quarrel, Sally. Don't be quarrelling
with us the last half-hour we shall be here.</p>

<p>SALLY: Perhaps not. But what was he masquerading round as not
married for, if he had a wife and a child?</p>

<p>ETHEL: You see, Miss Magneer, the fact that Dr Grainger chose
to keep his marriage a secret wouldn't have hurt <i>you,</i>
unless you'd rushed in to be hurt.</p>

<p>SALLY: Yes--meaning to say as I ran after him. (<i>To</i>
GRAINGER.) Eh?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Well--what else can you call it, Sally?</p>

<p>SALLY: And who wanted me to walk down the fields with him, the
first time he saw me?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I must say I think you wanted me quite as much, if
not more, than I wanted you, Sally.</p>

<p>SALLY: Oh, did I?</p>

<p>ETHEL: I have no doubt of it.</p>

<p>SALLY: And did every single girl you met want you then, Dr
Grainger?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I never said so nor meant so.</p>

<p>SALLY: The one downstairs, for instance.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Who d'you mean?</p>

<p>SALLY: Annie Calladine.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: What's she doing here?</p>

<p>ETHEL: She met me at the station. I left her holding baby.</p>

<p>SALLY: Let <i>her</i> come up, and say <i>her</i> share. No,
you daren't and you know it.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Daren't I? I say, Annie--Annie!</p>

<p>ANNIE'S VOICE: Yes!</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Would you mind coming upstairs a minute?</p>

<p>SALLY: Now you s'll hear <i>her</i> side, as well.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> ANNIE.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: You will excuse us--we were not expecting
callers.</p>

<p>ANNIE: How do you do?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Annie, Sally wants you to say everything you can
against me, in Ethel's hearing.</p>

<p>ANNIE: I don't wish to say everything I can against you, Dr
Grainger. But I do wish to say this, that you are a danger to
every unmarried girl, when you go about as you <i>have</i> gone,
here. And Mrs Grainger had better look after you very closely, if
she means to keep you.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Thank you, Annie, very nice.</p>

<p>ANNIE: Almost as nice as you have been to me.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I'm not aware that I've done you much damage.</p>

<p>ANNIE: If you haven't, it's not your fault.</p>

<p>ETHEL <i>flings herself suddenly on the bed, weeping
wildly.</i></p>

<p>SALLY: I'm thankful I'm not his wife.</p>

<p>ANNIE: And I am more than thankful.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Don't cry, Mrs Grainger. George is alright,
really.</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>fiercely</i>): He is <i>not,</i> Mr Brentnall.</p>

<p>SALLY: Neither is he.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Nay, don't cry, Mrs Grainger.</p>

<p>ELSA SMITH'S VOICE, <i>calling in a jolly singsong</i>:
<i>"Knabe, Knabe, wo bist du?"</i></p>

<p>BRENTNALL: <i>Gott sei dank, du bist gekommen. Komm
hinauf.</i></p>

<p>ELSA SMITH'S VOICE: <i>Ja!</i> (<i>Runs
upstairs</i>--<i>enter, chattering in German.</i>) Oh!</p>

<p>BRENTNALL (<i>shaking hands</i>): Frightful muddle! Miss Annie
Calladine--Mrs Grainger's awfully cut up because George has been
flirting round.</p>

<p>ELSA: With you, Miss Magneer--and Miss Calladine?</p>

<p>SALLY: Not to mention the rest.</p>

<p>ELSA: Oh--oh! I'm sorry. But don't cry, Mrs Grainger, please.
He's not a villain if he makes love to the other girls, surely.
Perhaps it's not <i>nice.</i> But it was under trying
circumstances.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: That's what I say.</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes, yes. You're just as bad yourself. <i>I</i> know
you.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Nay Elsa, I'm not the same.</p>

<p>ELSA: Oh, oh--now <i>don't</i> try to duck your head in the
whitewash pail with me, no. I won't have it. Don't cry, Mrs
Grainger, don't cry. He loves you, I'm sure he does, even if he
makes love to the others. (<i>To</i> GRAINGER.) Don't you? (<i>No
reply.</i>) Now you are sulking just like a great baby. And then
that's your <i>little</i> baby downstairs? Ah, the dear!
(<i>Sobbing from</i> ETHEL.) Never mind, never mind, cry out your
cry, then let me talk to you.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Come by motor-car?</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes, Will Hobson drove me.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Ha!</p>

<p>ELSA: I like him, so you needn't say "Ha!"</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Ha!</p>

<p>ELSA (<i>laughing</i>--<i>putting her hand on his
shoulder</i>): Not had breakfast, and smoking, and talking to
ladies. Aren't you ashamed, sir?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I've nothing to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>ELSA (<i>laughing</i>): No, no; hear him. (<i>Kisses him.</i>)
You are a dear, but a dreadful liar.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Nay, I'll be damned--I beg your pardon.</p>

<p>ELSA: No, you <i>never</i> use bad language, do you?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Not in the presence of ladies.</p>

<p>ELSA: Well, now listen, I prefer to have you as you are with
<i>men.</i> If you swear when you are with men, I prefer you to
swear when you are with me. Will you promise me you will?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: It wouldn't be a hard promise to keep.</p>

<p>ELSA: Promise me you won't have one philosophy when you are
with men, in your smoke-room, and another when you are with me,
in the drawing-room. Promise me you will be faithful to your
philosophy that you have with other men, even before me,
always.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Ha! Not so easy.</p>

<p>ELSA: Promise me. I want the real you, not your fiction.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I promise to do my best.</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes, and I trust you, you are so decent.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Nay, Elsa--</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes you are. Oh I see your faults, I do. But you are
decent. (<i>To</i> ETHEL, <i>who has stopped crying, but who
still lies on the bed.</i>)  Don't be <i>too</i> cross with Dr
Grainger, will you, Mrs Grainger? It's not <i>very</i> dreadful.
Perhaps Miss Magneer loved him a little--</p>

<p>SALLY: That I never did--</p>

<p>ELSA (<i>laughing</i>): Yes, you did. And (<i>to</i> ANNIE)
you were inclined to love him?</p>

<p>ANNIE: That is the worst part of it.</p>

<p>ELSA: Well, I, who am a woman, when I see other women who are
sweet or handsome or charming, I look at them and think: "Well,
how can a man help loving them, to some extent? Even if he loves
<i>me,</i> if I am not there, how can he help loving them?"</p>

<p>ANNIE: But not a married man.</p>

<p>ELSA: I think a man ought to be fair. He ought to offer his
love for just what it is--the love of a man married to another
woman--and so on. And, if there is any strain, he ought to tell
his wife--"I love this other woman."</p>

<p>SALLY: It's worse than Mormons.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: But better than subterfuge, bestiality, or
starvation and sterility.</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes, yes. If only men were decent enough.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: And women.</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes. Don't fret, Mrs Grainger. By loving these two
women, Dr Grainger has not lost any of his love for you. I would
stay with him.</p>

<p>SALLY: He certainly never loved me--except for what he could
get.</p>

<p>ELSA: Ha-ha! (<i>Very</i> <i>quaint and very earnest.</i>)
That is rather dreadful. But yes, he must have loved
you--something in you.</p>

<p>SALLY: It <i>was</i> something.</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes, I see what you mean--but I don't think you're quite
right. No, it's <i>not quite</i> so brutal.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Shall I walk across to you after lunch?</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes, do that.</p>

<p>ANNIE: I think I will go. Good-bye, Dr Grainger. (<i>Shakes
hands.</i>) Good-bye, Sally. Good-bye, Mr Brentnall.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Good-bye, Annie. Remember what I told you, and
decide for the best. <i>Don't</i> be afraid. (<i>Kisses
her.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA: Yes. I think, with a little love, we can help each other
so much.</p>

<p>ANNIE (<i>to</i> ELSA): Good-bye. (<i>Crossing and putting her
arms round</i> ETHEL.) He isn't bad, dear. You must bring out the
best in him. The baby is a <i>dear.</i> And you'll write to
me.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> ANNIE.</p>

<p>SALLY: Well, good-bye all. And if I were your wife, Dr
Grainger, I'd keep the bit between your teeth.</p>

<p>ELSA: No, no. No one should be driven like a horse between the
shafts. Each should live his own life; you are there to
<i>help</i> your husband, not to drive him.</p>

<p>SALLY: And to watch he doesn't help himself too often. Well,
goodbye. Shall we be seeing you again, Mr Brentnall?</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: Next week.</p>

<p>SALLY: Right--<i>do</i> come. Good-bye.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> SALLY.</p>

<p>ELSA (<i>crossing to</i> ETHEL): Good-bye. Don't make sorrow
and trouble in the world; try to make happiness. I think Satan is
in hard judgment, even more than is sin. Try to exonerate.</p>

<p>ETHEL: It's such a shock.</p>

<p>ELSA (<i>kissing her</i>): Ah yes, it is cruel. But don't let
your own suffering blind you, try not to. Good-bye. (<i>Kisses
her.</i>) Good-bye, Dr Grainger. (<i>Shakes hands.</i>)</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I will see you downstairs--by the way, Grainger and
Mrs Grainger are going to stay in my rooms.</p>

<p>ELSA: How perfectly delightful! Then I shall see you in
London. How lovely! Good-bye.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: I suppose I'm respectable enough to see you
downstairs.</p>

<p><i>Exeunt</i> ELSA <i>and</i> BRENTNALL. GRAINGER <i>and his
wife sit silent a while. They are afraid of each other.</i></p>

<p>GRAINGER: Will you go to London to Billy's rooms?</p>

<p>ETHEL: Does he want us to?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I suppose so.</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p>GRAINGER: Will you?</p>

<p>ETHEL: Do you want me to?</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You please yourself. I'm not coming to
Wolverhampton.</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>trying not to cry</i>): Well, we'll go to
London.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: It's a damned mess.</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>crying</i>): You'd better do just as you like, then,
and I'll go home.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: I didn't mean that.</p>

<p>ETHEL (<i>crying</i>): I'll go home.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Don't begin again, Ethel.</p>

<p>ETHEL: You hate the thought of being married to me. So you can
be free of me.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: And what about the baby? Don't talk rot, Ethel.
(<i>Puts his arm round her.</i>)</p>

<p>ETHEL: You don't care for that, either.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Don't I--you don't know. They all make me look as
black as I can--</p>

<p>ETHEL: Well, I don't know.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Yes they do--and they always have done. I never have
had anybody to stick up for me. (<i>Weeps a few tears.</i>) I've
had a rotten time, a rotten time.</p>

<p>ETHEL: And so have I.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: You don't know what it is to be a man.</p>

<p>ETHEL: I know what it is to be your wife.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Are you going to sling it in my teeth for ever?</p>

<p>ETHEL: No, I'm not. But what did you marry me for?
(<i>Cries.</i>)</p>

<p>GRAINGER (<i>embracing her</i>): You're the only girl I could
have married, Ethel. I've been a rotter to you, I have.</p>

<p>ETHEL: Never mind, we <i>shall</i> get on together, we shall.
Mind, somebody is coming.</p>

<p><i>A knock</i>--<i>enter</i> MRS PLUM <i>with the
baby.</i></p>

<p>MRS PLUM: He wants you, the precious little lad, he does. Oh
Dr Grainger, let me see you hold him! (<i>Gives the baby to</i>
GRAINGER.)</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> BRENTNALL.</p>

<p>BRENTNALL: That's the way, George.</p>

<p>GRAINGER: Shut up, fool.</p>
