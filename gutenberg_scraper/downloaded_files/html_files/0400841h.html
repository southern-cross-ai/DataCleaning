Etext prepared by "Teary Eyes" Anderson

Production Notes:

I've tried to keep the etext and html version of this book as close to the
book as possible, all words are, as they appear in the book, I've used the
hand written version as the model, and only added or changed the punctuation
to help it fit the etext, html and so it can easily be made into a a voice
speech program like MS Ereader, a free converter for such a program can be
found at
http://www.overdrive.com/readerworks/downloads/default.asp?Download=RWSTAN
and a player can be found at the Microsoft page
http://www.microsoft.com/reader/downloads/pc.asp you need both the setup and
the text speech programs to listen to the book on your computer.

My friend has a room mate that is blind and I feel the blind people of the
world should also be able to enjoy these books.

The next etext project I've been working on is the
Short Stories of H.G. Wells, text for it is complete but I still need to
spell check it and make it more text speach friendly, so it dosen't say
"exclamation point" when theres a '!' Hopefuly that'll be avalible soon,
this is my first etext and that will be my second. Then hopefully Jules
Verne novels and possibly even some Bram Stoker, I can make into etexts.
Hope you enjoy!!

<h1>The Adventures of Tommy</h1>
<br>
Written and illustrated by H.G. Wells<br>
Telling all about the Proud Rich Man and about the Present he gave
to Tommy.</center>

<center>There was once a very rich proud man. He was so rich &amp;
proud that he wore diamonds for buttons &amp; two gold watches
jewelled in every hole, and rings--four or five on each finger,
&amp; gold lace round his clothes-- he was so rich &amp;
proud.</center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<center>gave him some nasty medicine &amp; made him all right
again.</center></td>

&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<center>Now the rich man was very grateful to Tommy for having
saved his life, and wanted to give him a thousand pounds (£ 1000)
he had in his pocket. But Tommy had been told never to take money
from strangers, and refused this. "Oh," said the rich man, "I must
give you something."</center>

<center><img src="0400841h-images/0400841h-11.jpg" alt="11">
</center>

<center>"A good deed is it's own reward." said Tommy.</center>
<br>

<table border="0" width="100%" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<center>They talked a long time, and at last Tommy said that if the
rich man really wanted to make him a present he could get him a pet
animal to have for his very own. And with that the rich man went
away.</center>
</td>

</td>

<br>

<center>But when the rich man went to the animal shop he was much
too proud to buy Tommy a kitten, or a dog, or a rabbit, or white
mice, or a lamb, or pony, or a pigeon, or a parrot, or a porcupine,
or a gollifer, or a woggle, or any ordinary pet animal like
that.</center>
<img src="0400841h-images/0400841h-13.jpg" alt="13"><br>
<br>

<table border="0" width="100%" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<center>He wanted something larger and more expensive. He went to
one shop after another. One shop was full of monkeys and another of
guinea-pigs, but no! They were not magnificent enough. At one shop
was a tiger, but he did not buy that because he doubted if Tommy's
mother would like him to have such a pet--<br>
mothers are sometimes so particular.</center>
</td>
<td><img src="0400841h-images/0400841h-14.jpg" alt="14">

&nbsp;<br>

<center>And it was only after hunting all day in all the animal
shops of London that he found at last just the very thing he
wanted.</center>
<img src="0400841h-images/0400841h-15.jpg" alt="15">
<center>"Pack it carefully," he said, "and send it per South
Eastern Railway carriage paid-- to New Romney, to Master Tommy
Bates (this was not his real name), enclose my card and send the
bill in to me. And before you send him off, take him round to the
place where they paint letters on people's trunks and have a nice
large T B painted on both sides of him."</center>
<br>

<center>All of which they did accordingly.</center>

(you see they have done his trunk and tail &amp; feet with
straw)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<center>They packed the elephant very carefully and sent him off by
South Eastern Express delivery as the rich man had ordered. And in
less than a month a train brought him into New Romney safe and
sound; so swift &amp; perfect has the railway traffic of our
country districts become.</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;

<table border="0" width="100%" summary="">

<center>And the proud man got some new feathers for his hat and
thought no more of the matter.</center>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<img src="0400841h-images/0400841h-18.jpg" alt="18">
<center>You may judge how surprised Tommy and his father were when
a railway porter brought along this beautiful present.</center>
<br>

<center>Tommy was delighted and while father signed the porter's
book, he unpacked the elephant's trunk and gave it some suger &amp;
ran for a ladder so that he might climb up &amp; pat it.</center>
<img src="0400841h-images/0400841h-19.jpg" alt="19">
<center>And he decided, at once that he would call this new pet
Augustus, after the Roman emperor of that name.</center>
<br>

<center>And all that Tommy did with Augustus and all that Augustus
did with Tommy will perhaps be written someday in another
book.</center>
