  <h2><a name="pref"
     id="pref">PREFACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There is a passage in that charming book <i>The Bridge of
  San Luis Rey</i> which runs as follows: "She was one of these persons who
  have allowed their lives to be gnawed away because they have fallen in love
  with an idea several centuries before its appointed appearance in the history
  of Civilization. She hurled herself against the obstinacy of her time." We
  who believe in the psychic revelation, and who appreciate that a perception
  of these things is of the utmost importance, certainly have hurled ourselves
  against the obstinacy of our time. Possibly we have allowed some of our lives
  to be gnawed away in what, for the moment, seemed a vain and thankless quest.
  Only the future can show whether the sacrifice was worth it. Personally I
  think that it was. Among the various chords which are struck in this little
  book there may be some to which the mind of the reader will respond, and
  which may entice him also in the search for the Holy Grail.</p>

  <br>

  <h3>PART I</h3>

  <p class="first">Who was the greatest medium-baiter of modern times?
  Undoubtedly Houdini. Who was the greatest physical medium of modern times?
  There are some who would be inclined to give the same answer. I do not see
  how it can ever now be finally and definitely proved, but circumstantial
  evidence may be very strong, as Thoreau said when he found a trout in the
  milk jug. I foresee that the subject will be debated for many years to come,
  so perhaps my opinion, since I knew him well, and always entertained this
  possibility in my mind, may be of interest. If others add their experience in
  order to support or disprove my own surmises, then some result may eventually
  be obtained.</p>

  <p>I will first give some of my own personal impressions of Houdini. I will
  then dwell on some phases of his career which show his singular character,
  and I will then endeavour to give the argument as to the source of his unique
  powers.</p>

  <p>Let me say, in the first instance, that in a long life which has touched
  every side of humanity, Houdini is far and away the most curious and
  intriguing character whom I have ever encountered. I have met better men, and
  I have certainly met very many worse ones, but I have never met a man who had
  such strange contrasts in his nature, and whose actions and motives it was
  more difficult to foresee or to reconcile.</p>

  <p>I will first, as is only proper, dwell upon the great good which lay in
  his nature. He had the essential masculine quality of courage to a supreme
  degree. Nobody has ever done, and nobody in all human probability will ever
  do, such reckless feats of daring. His whole life was one long succession of
  them, and when I say that amongst them was the leaping from one aeroplane to
  another, with handcuffed hands at the height of three thousand feet, one can
  form an idea of the extraordinary lengths that he would go. In this, however,
  as in much more that concerned him, there was a certain psychic element which
  he was ready to admit freely. He told me that a voice which was independent
  of his own reason or judgment told him what to do and how to do it. So long
  as he obeyed the voice he was assured of safety. "It all comes as easy as
  stepping off a log," said he to me, "but I have to wait for the voice. You
  stand there before a jump, swallowing the yellow stuff that every man has in
  him. Then at last you hear the voice and you jump. Once I jumped on my own
  and I nearly broke my neck." This was the nearest admission that I ever had
  from him that I was right in thinking that there was a psychic element which
  was essential to every one of his feats.</p>

  <p>Apart from his amazing courage, he was remarkable for his cheery urbanity
  in every-day life. One could not wish a better companion so long as one was
  with him, though he might do and say the most unexpected things when one was
  absent. He was, like most Jews, estimable in his family relationships. His
  love for his dead mother seemed to be the ruling passion of his life, which
  he expressed on all sorts of public occasions in a way which was, I am sure,
  sincere, but is strange to our colder Western blood. There were many things
  in Houdini which were as Oriental as there were in our own Disraeli. He was
  devoted also to his wife, and with good reason, for she was as devoted to
  him, but again his intimacy showed itself in unconventional ways. When in his
  examination before the Senatorial Committee he was hard-pressed by some
  defender of Spiritualism who impugned his motives in his violent and
  vindictive campaign against mediums, his answer was to turn to his wife and
  to say, "I have always been a good boy, have I not?"</p>

  <p>Another favourable side of his character was his charity. I have heard,
  and am quite prepared to believe, that he was the last refuge of the
  down-and- outer, especially if he belonged to his own profession of showman.
  This charity extended even beyond the grave, and if he heard of any old
  magician whose tombstone needed repair he took it upon himself at once to set
  the matter right. Willie Davenport in Australia, Bosco in Germany, and many
  others of his profession were the objects of these pious offices. Whatever he
  did was done upon a large scale. He had many pensioners whom he did not know
  by sight. One man embraced him in the street, and upon Houdini angrily
  demanding who the devil he was, he answered, "Why, I am the man whose rent
  you have paid for the last ten years." He was devoted to children, though he
  had none of his own. He was never too busy to give a special free performance
  for the youngsters. At Edinburgh he was so shocked at the bare feet of the
  kiddies that he had them all into the theatre, and fitted them then and there
  with five hundred pairs of boots. He was the greatest publicity agent that
  ever lived, so that it is not ill-natured to surmise that the local papers
  had been advised beforehand, and that the advertisement was well worth it.
  There were other occasions, however, when his charity was less ostentatious.
  Animals too were loved by him, and he had a peculiar talent for taming them
  and teaching them tricks. All these ingredients in one impulsive personality
  surely make up a very lovable man. It is true that his generosity was
  curiously mixed with frugality, so that even while he was giving away his
  earnings at a rate which alarmed his wife, he would put an indignant comment
  in his diary because he had been charged two shillings for the pressing of
  his clothes.</p>

  <p>So much for his virtues&mdash;and most of us would be very glad to have as
  goodly a list. But all he did was extreme, and there was something to be
  placed in the other scale.</p>

  <p>A prevailing feature of his character was a vanity which was so obvious
  and childish that it became more amusing than offensive. I can remember, for
  example, that when he introduced his brother to me, he did it by saying,
  "This is the brother of the great Houdini." This without any twinkle of
  humour and in a perfectly natural manner.</p>

  <p>This enormous vanity was combined with a passion for publicity which knew
  no bounds, and which must at all costs be gratified. There was no
  consideration of any sort which would restrain him if he saw his way to an
  advertisement. Even when he laid flowers upon the graves of the dead it was
  in the prearranged presence of the local photographers.</p>

  <p>It was this desire to play a constant public part which had a great deal
  to do with his furious campaign against Spiritualism. He knew that the public
  took a keen interest in the matter, and that there was unlimited publicity to
  be had from it. He perpetually offered large sums to any medium who would do
  this or that, knowing well that even in the unlikely event of the thing being
  done he could always raise some objection and get out of it. Sometimes his
  tactics were too obvious to be artistic. In Boston he arrived by
  prearrangement before a great crowd at the City Hall and walked solemnly up
  the steps with ten thousand dollars' worth of stock in his hand, which
  represented one of his perennial stakes against phenomena. This was in
  connection with his engagement on a tour of the music-halls. His favourite
  argument, and that of many of his fellow-conjurers, was this flourishing of
  dollar-wads. It is obviously absurd, since the money will only be paid if you
  satisfy the challenger, and since the challenger has to pay the money he
  naturally never will be satisfied. The classical instance is that of the
  <i>Scientific American</i> magazine, which offered a large sum for any
  well-attested psychic phenomenon, but on being confronted with the Crandon
  phenomena, which are perhaps the best attested in the whole annals of
  psychical research, found reasons for withholding the money. I remember that
  when I arrived in New York, Houdini offered some huge sum that he could do
  anything which I had ever seen a medium do. I at once accepted his challenge,
  and proposed as a test that he should materialize the face of my mother in
  such a way that others besides myself who had known her in life could
  recognize it. I heard no more of the matter after that, and yet in England a
  medium had actually done this. I would have brought my witnesses across the
  Atlantic had the test been accepted.</p>

  <p>I am quite prepared to think that Houdini's campaign against mediums did
  temporary good so far as false mediums goes, but it was so indiscriminate and
  accompanied by so much which was intolerant and offensive that it turned away
  the sympathy and help which Spiritualists, who are anxious for the
  cleanliness of their own movement, would gladly have given him. The unmasking
  of false mediums is our urgent duty, but when we are told that, in spite of
  our own evidence and that of three generations of mankind, there are no real
  ones we lose interest, for we know that we are speaking to an ignorant man.
  At the same time, the States, and in a lesser degree our own people, do need
  stern supervision. I admit that I underrated the corruption in the States.
  What first brought it home to me was that my friend Mrs. Crandon told me that
  she had received price lists from some firm which manufactures fraudulent
  instruments for performing tricks. If such a firm can make a living, there
  must be some villainy about, and a more judicious Houdini might well find a
  useful field of activity. It is these hyenas who retard our progress. I have
  myself had a hand in exposing more than one of them.</p>

  <p>There was a particular Hall in Boston which Houdini used for his tirades
  against the spirits. Some weeks after his campaign a curious and disagreeable
  phenomenon broke out there. Showers of gravel or of small pebbles fell
  continually among the audience, and several people suffered minor injuries. A
  police watch was kept up for some time, and eventually it was shown that a
  staid employee, whose record was an excellent one, was in the habit, without
  rhyme or reason, of stealing up to the gallery and throwing these missiles
  down into the stalls. When tried for the offence he could only say that a
  senseless but overpowering impulse caused him to do it. Many psychic students
  would be prepared to consider that the incident would bear the interpretation
  of a poltergeist on the one side and an obsession on the other.</p>

  <p>There was another incident at Boston of a very much more serious kind, and
  one which bears out my assertion that where there was an advertisement to be
  gained Houdini was a dangerous man. The remarkable psychic powers of Mrs.
  Crandon, the famous "Margery," were at that time under examination by the
  committee of the <i>Scientific American</i>. Various members of this
  committee had sat many times with the Crandons, and some of them had been
  completely converted to the psychic explanation, while others, though unable
  to give any rational explanation of the phenomena, were in different stages
  of dissent. It would obviously be an enormous feather in Houdini's cap if he
  could appear on the scene and at once solve the mystery. What a glorious
  position to be in! Houdini laid his plans and was so sure of success that
  before going to Boston he wrote a letter, which I saw, to a mutual friend in
  London, announcing that he was about to expose her. He would have done it,
  too, had it not been for an interposition which was miraculous. I think well
  enough of Houdini to hope that he would have held his hand if he could have
  realized the ruin and disgrace which his success would have brought upon his
  victims. As it was, the thought of the tremendous advertisement swallowed up
  his scruples. All America was watching, and he could not resist the
  temptation.</p>

  <p>He had become familiar in advance with the procedure of the Crandon
  circle, and with the types of phenomena. It was easy for him to lay his
  plans. What he failed to take into account was that the presiding spirit,
  Walter, the dead brother of Mrs. Crandon, was a very real and live entity,
  who was by no means inclined to allow his innocent sister to be made the
  laughingstock of the continent. It was the unseen Walter who checkmated the
  carefully-laid plans of the magician. The account of what occurred I take
  from the notes which were taken by the circle at the time. The first
  phenomenon to be tested was the ringing of an electric bell which could only
  be done by pressing down a flap of wood, well out of the reach of the medium.
  The room was darkened, but the bell did not ring. Suddenly the angry voice of
  Walter was heard.</p>

  <p>"You have put something to stop the bell ringing, Houdini, you&mdash;" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>Walter has a wealth of strong language and makes no pretence at all to be
  a very elevated being. They all have their use over there. On this occasion,
  at least, the use was evident, for when the light was turned up, there was
  the rubber from the end of a pencil stuck into the angle of the flap in such
  a way as to make it impossible that it could descend and press the bell. Of
  course, Houdini professed complete ignorance as to how it got there, but who
  else had the deft touch to do such a thing in the dark, and why was it only
  in his presence that such a thing occurred? It is clear that if he could say
  afterwards, when he had quietly removed the rubber, that his arrival had made
  all further trickery impossible, he would have scored the first trick in the
  game.</p>

  <p>He should have taken warning and realized that he was up against powers
  which were too strong for him, and which might prove dangerous if provoked
  too far. But the letters he had written and boasts he had made cut off his
  retreat. The second night landed him in a very much worse mess than the first
  one. He had brought with him an absurd box which was secured in front by no
  fewer than eight padlocks. One would have thought that it was a gorilla
  rather than a particularly gentle lady who was about to be confined within.
  The forces behind Margery showed what they thought of this contraption by
  bursting the whole front open the moment Margery was fastened into it. This
  very unexpected development Houdini endeavoured to explain away, but he found
  it difficult to give a reason why, if the box was so vulnerable, it was worth
  while to bring it with so much pomp and ceremony, with eight padlocks and
  many other gadgets, all the way from New York to Boston.</p>

  <p>However, much worse was to come. The lady was put into the reconstituted
  box, her arms protruding through holes on each side Houdini was observed
  without any apparent reason to pass his hand along the lady's arm, and so
  into the box. Presently, after some experiments, the lady's arms were placed
  inside and the attempt was to be made to ring the bell-box while only her
  head projected. Suddenly the terrible Walter intervened.</p>

  <p>"Houdini, you&mdash; blackguard!" he thundered. "You have put a rule into
  the cabinet. You&mdash;! Remember, Houdini, you won't live for ever. Some day
  you've got to die."</p>

  <p>The lights were turned on, and, shocking to relate, a two-foot folding
  rule was found lying in the box. It was a most deadly trick, for, of course,
  if the bell had rung Houdini would have demanded a search of the cabinet, the
  rule would have been found, it would, if held between the teeth, have enabled
  the medium to have reached and pressed down the flap of the bell-box, and all
  America would have resounded next day with the astuteness of Houdini and the
  proven villainy of the Crandons. I do not think that even the friends of the
  latter could have got over the patent facts. It was the most dangerous moment
  of their career, and only Walter saved them from ruin.</p>

  <p>For the moment Houdini was completely overcome, and cowered, as well he
  might, before the wrath of the unseen. His offence was so obvious that no
  better excuse occurred to him, when he had rallied his senses, than that the
  rule had been left there by accident by some subordinate. When one considers,
  however, that no other tool upon earth, neither a hammer, a chisel, nor a
  wrench, but only a folding two-foot rule, could have sustained the charge,
  one realizes how hopeless was his position. But one of Houdini's
  characteristics was that nothing in this world or the next could permanently
  abash him. He could not suggest that they were guilty considering that the
  Crandons had actually asked to have the cabinet examined after she had
  entered, and Houdini had refused. Yet, incredible as it may seem, he had his
  advertisement after all, for he flooded America with a pamphlet to say that
  he had shown that the Crandons were frauds, and that he had in some
  unspecified way exposed them. Since the cabinet had become a delicate subject
  his chief accusation was that Mrs. Crandon had in some way rung the bell-box
  by stretching out her foot. He must have known, though his complaisant
  audiences did not, that the bell-box was continually rung while some sitter
  was permitted to hold it in his hands, and even to rise and to walk about
  with it.</p>

  <p>Speaking with a full knowledge, I say that this Boston incident was never
  an exposure of Margery, but it was a very real exposure of Houdini, and is a
  most serious blot upon his career.</p>

  <p>To account for the phenomena he was prepared to assert that not only the
  doctor, but that even members of the committee were in senseless
  collaboration with the medium. The amazing part of the business was that
  other members of the committee seemed to have been overawed by the masterful
  conjurer, and even changed their very capable secretary, Mr. Malcolm Bird, at
  his behest. Mr. Bird, it may be remarked, with a far better brain than
  Houdini, and with a record of some fifty s&eacute;ances, had by this time
  been entirely convinced of the truth of the phenomena.</p>

  <p>It may seem unkind that I should dwell upon these matters now that Houdini
  has gone to his account, but what I am writing now I also published during
  his lifetime. I deal gently with the matter, but I have to remember that its
  importance far transcends any worldly consideration, and that the honour of
  the Crandons is still impugned in many minds by the false charges which were
  not only circulated in print, but were shouted by Houdini from the platforms
  of a score of music-halls with a violence which browbeat and overbore every
  protest from the friends of truth. Houdini did not yet realize the gravity of
  his own actions, or the consequences which they entailed. The Crandons are
  themselves the most patient and forgiving people in the world, treating the
  most irritating opposition with a good-humoured and amused tolerance. But
  there are other forces which are beyond human control, and from that day the
  shadow lay heavy upon Houdini. His anti-Spiritualist agitation became more
  and more unreasoning until it bordered upon a mania which could only be
  explained in some quarters by supposing that he was in the pay of certain
  clerical fanatics, an accusation which I do not believe. It is true that in
  order to preserve some show of reason he proclaimed that he wished only to
  attack dishonest mediums, but as in the same breath he would assert that
  there were no honest ones, his moderation was more apparent than real. If he
  had consulted the reports of the National Association of American
  Spiritualists he would have found that this representative body was far more
  efficient in exposing those swindlers than he had ever been, for they had the
  necessary experience by which the true can be separated from the false.</p>

  <p>I suppose that at that time Houdini was, from an insurance point of view,
  so far as bodily health goes, the best life of his age in America. He was in
  constant training, and he used neither alcohol nor tobacco. Yet all over the
  land warnings of danger arose. He alluded in public to the matter again and
  again. In my own home circle I had the message some months before his death,
  "Houdini is doomed, doomed, doomed!" So seriously did I take this warning
  that I would have written to him had I the least hope that my words could
  have any effect. I knew, however, by previous experience, that he always
  published my letters, even the most private of them, and that it would only
  give him a fresh pretext for ridiculing that which I regard as a sacred
  cause.</p>

  <p>But as the months passed and fresh warnings came from independent sources,
  both I and, as I believe, the Crandons, became seriously alarmed for his
  safety. He was, on one side of his character, so fine a fellow that even
  those who were attacked in this monstrous way were unwilling that real harm
  should befall him. But he continued to rave, and the shadow continued to
  thicken. I have an American friend who writes in the press under the name of
  Samri Frikell. He is really Fulton Oursler, the distinguished novelist, whose
  <i>Step-child of the Moon</i> is, in my judgment, one of the best of recent
  romances. Oursler was an intimate friend of Houdini, and he has allowed me to
  quote some of his experiences.</p>

  <p>"You know him as well as I do," writes Oursler. "You knew the immense
  vanity of the man. You know that he loved to be important. My experience with
  him for the last three months of his life was most peculiar. He would call me
  on the telephone at seven o'clock in the morning and he would be in a
  quarrelsome mood. He would talk for an hour telling me how important he was
  and what a great career he was making. In his voice was a hysterical, almost
  feminine, note of rebellion, as if his hands were beating against an
  immutable destiny.</p>

  <p>"In all these cases Houdini portrayed to me a clear sense of impending
  doom. This is not an impression which I have received subsequent to his
  death. But I commented upon it at the time. I believe that Houdini sensed the
  coming of his death, but did not know that it meant death. He didn't know
  what it meant, but he hated it and his soul screamed out in indignation."</p>

  <p>Some time later he telephoned to the same friend in a way which showed
  that his surmise had become more definite. "I am marked for death," said he.
  "I mean that they are predicting my death in spirit circles all over the
  country." At that time he was starting in perfect health upon that tour of
  the Vaudevilles which was destined to be the last of his career. Within a few
  weeks he was dead.</p>

  <p>The details of that death were in many ways most singular. On October 11th
  he had a painful but, as everyone thought, an unimportant accident, when
  during his performance his ankle sustained an injury. The incident was
  treated quite lightly by the Press, but was regarded more seriously by those
  who had other sources of information. On October 13th, two days after the
  accident, the gentleman already quoted had a letter from a medium, Mrs.
  Wood.</p>

  <p>"Three years ago," said this ill-omened epistle, "the spirit of Dr. Hyslop
  said, 'The waters are black for Houdini', and he foretold that disaster would
  befall him while performing before an audience in a theatre. Dr. Hyslop now
  says that the injury is more serious than has been reported, and that
  Houdini's days as a magician are over."</p>

  <p>The sad prophecy proved to be only too true, though the injured leg was
  only the prelude of worse disaster. It seemed indeed to be a sign that the
  protective mantle which had been around him had for some reason been
  withdrawn. The ankle continued to pain him, though he managed for some weeks
  to give his accustomed show. At Montreal a member of the audience rose to
  protest against the violence with which he raved against Spiritualism, and
  very particularly against me. Such personal attacks were not to be taken too
  seriously, for it was part of his perfervid nature that anyone who had
  experiences which differed from his own was either a dupe or a scoundrel. He
  bore up with great bravery against the pain from which he must have
  continually suffered, but in less than a fortnight, while on the stage at
  Detroit, he completely collapsed, and was carried to that hospital from which
  he never emerged alive.</p>

  <p>There were some remarkable points about his death. It seems that upon
  Friday, October 22nd, he was lying in his dressing-room, reading his letters.
  It was about five in the afternoon. He had lectured at McGill University a
  few days before, and with his usual affability he allowed some of the
  students to come in and see him. What followed may be taken verbatim from the
  report of one of these young men.</p>

  <p>"'Houdini,' he says, 'was facing us and lying down on a couch at the time
  reading some mail, his right side nearest us.' This first-year student
  engaged Houdini more or less continually in a conversation whilst my friend
  Mr. Smilovitch continued to sketch Houdini. This student was the first to
  raise the question of Houdini's strength. My friend and I were not so much
  interested in his strength as we were in his mental acuteness, his skill, his
  beliefs and his personal experiences. Houdini stated that he had
  extraordinary muscles in his forearms, in his shoulders and in his back, and
  he asked all of us present to feel them, which we did.</p>

  <p>"The first-year McGill student asked Houdini whether it was true that
  punches in the stomach did not hurt him. Houdini remarked rather
  unenthusiastically that his stomach could resist much, although he did not
  speak of it in superlative terms. Thereupon he gave Houdini some very hammer-
  like blows below the belt, first securing Houdini's permission to strike him.
  Houdini was reclining at the time with his right side nearest Whitehead, and
  the said student was more or less bending over him. These blows fell on that
  part of the stomach to the right of the navel, and were struck on the side
  nearest us, which was in fact Houdini's right side; I do not remember exactly
  how many blows were struck. I am certain, however, of at least four very hard
  and severe body blows, because at the end of the second or third blow I
  verbally protested against this sudden onslaught on the part of this
  first-year student, using the words, 'Hey there. You must be crazy, what are
  you doing?' or words to that effect, but Whitehead continued striking Houdini
  with all his strength.</p>

  <p>"Houdini stopped him suddenly in the midst of a punch, with a gesture that
  he had had enough. At the time Whitehead was striking Houdini, the latter
  looked as though he was in extreme pain and winced as each blow was
  struck.</p>

  <p>"Houdini immediately after stated that he had had no opportunity to
  prepare himself against the blows, as he did not think that Whitehead would
  strike him as suddenly as he did and with such force, and that he would have
  been in a better position to prepare for the blows if he had arisen from his
  couch for this purpose, but the injury to his foot prevented him from getting
  about rapidly."</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that the immediate cause of the death was ruptured
  appendix, and it was certified as traumatic appendicitis by all three doctors
  who attended him. It is, however, a very rare complaint, one of the doctors
  asserting that he had never seen a case before. When one considers how often
  boxers are struck violent blows in this region, one can understand that it is
  not usually so vulnerable. From the time that he reached hospital he seems to
  have known that he was doomed.</p>

  <p>Even after death strange things continued to happen which seem to be
  beyond the range of chance or coincidence. Some little time before Houdini
  had ordered a very ornate coffin, which he proposed to use in some
  sensational act. He paid no less than two thousand five hundred dollars for
  it. The idea was, I believe, to have a glass face to it and to exhibit the
  magician within it after it was hermetically sealed up, for he had shown in a
  previous experiment an inexplicable capacity for living without air. He
  carried this coffin about with him in one of the very numerous crates in
  which all his apparatus was packed. After his death all his goods were, I am
  told, sent on to New York. It was found, however, that by some blunder one
  box had been left behind. On examination this was found to contain the show
  coffin, which was accordingly used for his burial. At that burial some
  curious and suggestive words were used by the presiding rabbi, Barnard
  Drachman. He said: "Houdini possessed a wondrous power that he never
  Understood, and which he never revealed to anyone in life." Such an
  expression coming at so solemn a moment from one who may have been in a
  special position to know must show that my speculations are not extravagant
  or fantastic when I deal with the real source of those powers. The rabbi's
  speech is to be taken with Houdini's own remark, when he said to my wife:
  "There are some of my feats which my own wife does not know the secret of." A
  famous Chinese conjurer who saw him perform said, "This is not a trick, it is
  a gift." He frequently said that his work would die with him, and he has left
  no legacy of it so far as can be seen, though it would clearly be a very
  valuable asset. What can cover all these facts, save that there was some
  element in his power which was peculiar to himself, and that could only point
  to a psychic element&mdash;in a word, that he was a medium?</p>

  <p>In the remarkable ceremony performed beside his coffin by his brother-
  magicians, the spokesman broke a symbolic wand and said: "The wand is broken.
  God touched him with a wondrous gift, and our brother used it. Now the wand
  is broken." It may indeed have been not mere trickery but a God-given gift
  which raised Houdini to such a height. And why should he not use it, if it
  were indeed the gift of God? I see no reason why the medium, like other
  God-endowed men&mdash;the painter, the poet, or the romancer&mdash;should not
  earn money and renown by his gift. Let him hesitate, however, before he makes
  rash attacks upon those who are using the same gift, and for higher ends.</p>

  <p>Other curious points, which may possibly come within the range of
  coincidence, are connected with the death of Houdini. For example, there was
  a Mr. Gysel, who had shared in Houdini's views as to Spiritualism. He wrote
  thus to my friend:</p>

  <p>"MR. FRIKELL,&mdash;"Something happened to me in my room on Sunday night,
  October 24th, 1926, 10.58: Houdini had given me a picture of himself which I
  had framed and hung on the wall. At the above time and date the picture fell
  to the ground, breaking the glass. I now know that Houdini will die. Maybe
  there is something in these psychic phenomena after all."</p>

  <p>To this Mr. "Frikell" adds:</p>

  <p>"As I think back on my own experience I am inclined to agree maybe there
  is indeed something to the psychic phenomena after all."</p>

  <p>His admission is the more noteworthy as I remember the day when he was a
  strong and intelligent opponent.</p>

  <p>I will now turn to a consideration of the nature of Houdini's powers, and
  in order to appreciate the argument one has to consider the nature of some of
  the feats which he did actually perform. A list of these would make a
  considerable pamphlet, but a few typical ones may be selected. A general
  outline of his life, too, may not be out of place.</p>

  <p>Houdini's real name was Eric Weiss, and he was born in 1874, in the State
  of Wisconsin, in one of those small towns which seem to be the real centres
  of American originality. He was the seventh son of a Jewish rabbi, and he has
  left it on record that his mother did not even know the English language. He
  has also left it on record that in his early youth he had some connection
  with mediumship, though of a most doubtful variety. He has not scrupled to
  confess that he eked out any powers he may have had by the expedient of
  reading the names upon the graves in the local cemeteries. It was a good deal
  later than this that he first met a true medium in the shape of Ira
  Davenport, the only survivor of the famous brothers whose powers amazed all
  England in the 'sixties, and who, in spite of all the interested claims of
  Maskelyne and other conjurers, were never exposed, nor even adequately
  imitated. I have before me as I write a letter from Houdini himself, in which
  he tells me:</p>

  <p>"I was an intimate friend of Ira Erastus Davenport. I can make the
  positive assertion that the Davenport Brothers never were exposed. I know
  more about the Davenports than anyone living."</p>

  <p>He then adds the very curious and notable sentence:</p>

  <p>"I know for a fact that it was not necessary for them to remove their
  bonds in order to obtain manifestations."</p>

  <p>When one considers that these bonds were often handcuffs or twisted copper
  wire, and that the manifestations occurred in many cases within a few seconds
  of the closing of the cabinet, this admission by one, who claims that he
  knows, is of very great importance. We will return to this later, after we
  have enumerated a few of his results.</p>

  <p>He could, and continually did, walk straight out of any prison cell in
  which he might be confined. They placed him at Washington in the cell in
  which Guiteau, the murderer of Garfield, had been locked, but he readily
  emerged. In the letter from which I have already quoted, he says to me:</p>

  <p>"I pledge my word of honour that I was never given any assistance, nor was
  in collusion with anyone."</p>

  <p>This was clearly the case, for he performed the feat many times in
  different places, and was always searched to prove that he had no tools in
  his possession. Sometimes the grinning warders had hardly got out of the
  passage before their prisoner was at their heels. It takes some credulity, I
  think, to say that this was, in the ordinary sense of the word, a trick.</p>

  <p>Handcuffs might have been made of jelly, so easily did his limbs pass
  through them. He was heavily manacled at Scotland Yard, and placed behind a
  screen from over which a shower of manacles began to fall until he stepped
  out a free man. These things he could do in an instant. When I was lecturing
  at the Carnegie Hall in New York, my wife and Houdini walked down some side
  corridor after the lecture in order to rejoin me. They came to a padlocked
  door, and my wife was about to turn back. To her amazement, her companion put
  out his hand and picked off the locked padlock as one picks a plum from a
  tree. Was that a trick, or are all these talks about sleight of hand what
  Houdini himself would call "bunk" or "hokum"?</p>

  <p>When Houdini was in Holland, he got the local basketmakers to weave a
  basket round him. Out of this he emerged. He was shut up later in a sealed
  paper bag and came out, leaving it intact. A block of ice was frozen round
  his body and he burst his way out. One who has attempted to bring his feats
  within the range of normal explanations tells us that he did this by
  "depressing his periphery as a prelude to dynamic expansion"&mdash;whatever
  that may mean. He was also buried six feet deep in California and emerged
  unhurt, though we are not told by what dynamic expansion the feat was
  achieved.</p>

  <p>In Leeds he was coopered up in a cask by the brewers, but he was soon out.
  At Krupps' he defied the whole management, who constructed a special set of
  fetters for his behoof. They had no better luck than the others. He was put
  into the Siberian convict van at Moscow, but walked straight out of it. On
  December 2nd, 1906, he leaped from the Old Belle Isle Bridge at Detroit
  heavily handcuffed, and released himself under icy water, which would
  paralyse any man's limbs, On August 26th, 1907, he was thrown into San
  Francisco Bay with his hands tied behind his back and seventy-five pounds of
  ball and chain attached to his body. He was none the worse. He escaped from a
  padlocked United States mail-bag, as many a parcel has done before him.
  Finally, he was manacled, tied up in a box, and dropped into the East River
  at New York, but lived to tell the tale.</p>

  <p>Whatever may have been the true source of Houdini's powers&mdash;and I am
  not prepared to be dogmatic upon the point&mdash;I am very sure that the
  explanations of his fellow-conjurers do not always meet the case. Thus we
  have Mr. Harry Kellock, to whose book I am indebted for much supplementary
  information, talking persuasively about the magician's skill with a
  pick-lock. He had told reporters that his method was to have a small
  instrument which was concealed by surgeon's plaster upon the sole of his
  foot. This would certainly seem to be very useful when he was lowered in a
  coffin to the bottom of the sea!</p>

  <p>Of course, I am aware that Houdini really was a very skilful conjurer. All
  that could be known in that direction he knew. Thus he confused the public
  mind by mixing up things which were dimly within their comprehension with
  things which were beyond anyone's comprehension. I am aware also that there
  is a box trick, and that there is a normal handcuff and bag trick. But these
  are not in the same class with Houdini's work. I will believe they are when I
  see one of these other gentlemen thrown in a box off London Bridge. One poor
  man in America actually believed these explanations, and on the strength of
  them jumped in a weighted packing-case into a river in the Middle West; and
  one did so in Germany. They are there yet!</p>

  <p>To show the difference between Houdini's methods and those by which the
  box trick is done by other conjurers, I will give a description of the latter
  by one who has all normal tricks at his finger-ends. He says:</p>

  <p>"While the air-holes are there for ventilation they are there for another
  purpose, and that is that the man inside may get a catch or grip of that
  particular board. The first thing that is done by the man inside is to put
  his back up against the side next the audience and with his feet force off
  the board with the air-holes in it. After freeing this board, with a bit of
  string he lowers this board to the floor. If any obstruction comes in the way
  in the shape of a nail which he cannot force with his concealed lever and
  hammer, he cuts the nail with a fine saw. Thus his escape. The ropes are only
  a blind, as quite sufficient room can be got to get out between ropes. The
  procedure to close up again is simple. The iron nails are placed back upon
  the holes from which they were forced and squeezed in and knocked with a
  leather-covered hammer."</p>

  <p>Such is the usual technique as described by an expert. Does anyone believe
  that all this could be done as I have seen Houdini do it in a little over a
  minute, or could one imagine it being carried out at the bottom of a river? I
  contend that Houdini's performance was on an utterly different plane, and
  that it is an outrage against common sense to think otherwise.</p>

  <p>I will now take a single case of Houdini's powers, and of the sort of
  thing that he would say, in order to show the reader what he is up against if
  he means to maintain that these tricks had no abnormal element. The
  description is by my friend, Captain Bartlett, himself a man of many
  accomplishments, psychic and otherwise. In the course of their conversation
  he said to his guest:</p>

  <p>"'How about your box trick?'</p>

  <p>"Instantly his expression changed. The sparkle left his eyes and his face
  looked drawn and haggard. 'I cannot tell you,' he said, in a low, tense
  voice. 'I don't know myself, and, what is more, I have always a dread lest I
  should fail, and then I would not live. I have promised Mrs. Houdini to give
  up the box trick at the end of the season, for she makes herself ill with
  anxiety, and for myself I shall be relieved too.'</p>

  <p>"He stooped to stroke our cats, and to our amazement they fled from the
  room with their tails in the air, and for some minutes they dashed wildly up
  and down stairs, scattering the mats in all directions.</p>

  <p>"After this we had an earnest talk on psychic phenomena, and he told me of
  strange happenings to himself, especially at the grave of his mother, to whom
  he was deeply attached.</p>

  <p>"The trunk-makers of Bristol had made a challenge box from which he was
  billed to escape that evening. He begged me to be with him, explaining that
  he liked the support of a sensitive, more especially as he was feeling
  anxious.</p>

  <p>"I willingly agreed, the more especially as he allowed me to bring a very
  observant friend, a civil engineer of repute.</p>

  <p>"The box was made of inch planking, tongued and grooved, with double
  thickness at the ends. It was nailed herring-bone fashion, three-inch nails,
  three inches apart. Several auger holes were made at one end to admit air,
  and the whole thing was carefully and solidly finished. It was, as I have
  said, a challenge box, yet we thoroughly overhauled it and were satisfied
  that it contained no tricks.</p>

  <p>"Houdini lay down in it, while the challengers climbed to the platform and
  nailed down the heavy top again, using three-inch nails as before. The box
  was then tightly roped, three men pulling on the cords. Meanwhile, Houdini
  inside the box called out that it was very hot, and, putting a finger through
  an air-hole, waggled it furiously.</p>

  <p>"The box was then enclosed by a tent consisting of brass rods covered by a
  silken canopy.</p>

  <p>"In ninety-five seconds Houdini was standing before his audience,
  breathless, and with his shirt in tatters. The box-makers, after careful
  examination, in which we joined, declared that both box and roping were
  intact.</p>

  <p>"Now, was Houdini's statement that he never knew how he got out of the box
  a mere blind, or did he employ supernormal forces and dematerialize? If I put
  a beetle in a bottle, hermetically sealed, and that beetle makes its escape,
  I, being only an ordinary human, and not a magician, can only conclude that
  either the beetle has broken the laws of matter, or that it possesses secrets
  that I should call supernormal."</p>

  <p>I would also ask the reader to consider the following account by the late
  Mr. Hewat Mackenzie, one of the most experienced psychical researchers in the
  world. In his book, <i>Spirit Intercourse</i> (p. 86), he says:</p>

  <p>"A small iron tank filled with water was deposited on the stage, and in it
  Houdini was placed, the water completely covering his body. Over this was
  placed an iron lid with three hasps and staples, and these were securely
  locked. The body was then completely dematerialized within this tank in one
  and a half minutes, while the author stood immediately over it. Without
  disturbing any of the locks Houdini was transferred from the tank direct to
  the back of the stage front, dripping with water and attired in the blue
  jersey-suit in which he entered the tank. From the time that he entered it to
  the time that he came to the front only one and a half minutes had
  elapsed.</p>

  <p>"While the author stood near the tank during the dematerialization process
  a great loss of physical energy was felt by him, such as is usually felt by
  sitters in materializing s&eacute;ances who have a good stock of vital
  energy, as in such phenomena a large amount of energy is required... This
  startling manifestation of one of Nature's profoundest miracles was probably
  regarded by most of the audience as a very clever trick."</p>

  <p>In other words, in Mr. Mackenzie's opinion the audience was successfully
  bluffed by the commercialization of psychic power. It is remarkable and most
  suggestive that in this case, as in the Bristol one already given, Houdini
  was anxious that some psychic from whom he could draw strength should stand
  near him.</p>

  <p>Can any reasonable man read such an account as this and then dismiss the
  possibility which I suggest as fantastic? It seems to me that the fantasy
  lies in refusing its serious consideration.</p>

  <p>A point which is worth considering is, that even if we grant that enormous
  practice and natural advantages might conceivably give a man a facility in
  one direction which might appear preternatural, these feats of Houdini cover
  a larger range than could be accounted for by any one aptitude. This
  consideration becomes stronger still when one sees that his powers really
  covered the whole field of what we usually associate with physical mediumship
  in its strongest form, and can be covered so far as I can see by no other
  explanation whatever.</p>

  <p>His friend Mr. Bernard Ernst, a well-known and very level-headed lawyer of
  New York, told me that on one occasion upon the veranda of his own country
  house at Long Island, Houdini proposed a s&eacute;ance. When hands were laid
  upon the table it began to rise up in the air. As Mrs. Houdini was present,
  Ernst took it for granted at first that the hands or feet were used to
  produce the effect. On examination, however, in good light he found that this
  was not so, and that there were no steel rods up the sleeve, which is a
  fraudulent method occasionally used. The feat appeared to him&mdash;and he is
  himself an experienced conjurer&mdash;to be clearly preternatural. Houdini
  himself rebuked a tendency towards levity upon the part of the company, and
  treated the matter with great gravity.</p>

  <p>Now let us take the case of the s&eacute;ance which he gave to President
  Roosevelt&mdash;a bogus s&eacute;ance according to Houdini. It was on board
  the <i>Imperator</i> in June 1920. It followed the lines of the usual slate
  phenomenon as practised by many mediums, honest and otherwise. The written
  question, folded and sealed, is placed between the folding slates, and the
  answer is found upon one side of the slate when they are opened. Roosevelt
  wrote the question, "Where was I last Christmas?" folded, sealed in an
  envelope, and placed it between the slates with his own hand. When the slates
  were opened a map of the South American journey of Roosevelt was found to be
  drawn, with the legend "Near the Andes." The President was naturally greatly
  amazed and Houdini refused to give any explanation, though had it been a mere
  trick and there was no reason for secrecy, it would have been most natural
  that he should have explained it to so important a person, in order to show
  how easily fraudulent mediums can operate.</p>

  <p>Long afterwards he did give an explanation, which is so incredible that I
  would take it as an extreme example of that contempt which Houdini had for
  the public intelligence, taking it for granted that they would swallow
  without question anything which he might put before them. To condense a long
  story which the curious may find on pages 244-6 of Kellock's very readable
  book, the "explanation" ran thus:</p>

  <p>He knew that the President would be aboard and he received advance
  information about the South American travels from friends on the <i>Daily
  Telegraph,</i> which he made note of in case there should be a s&eacute;ance
  on board. So far we are on understandable ground. He suggested that such a
  s&eacute;ance should be held, and had the slates prepared. This also we may
  pass. He then asked for written questions from the passengers, and himself
  wrote several, "Where did I spend last Christmas?" which he placed upon the
  top of the pile. We are still on more or less solid ground, presuming that
  the passengers were so dense as not to see the change of slates from the one
  which they examined to the prepared one. But now comes the fatal link in the
  chain. He claims that, "no telepathy or thought-transference being involved,"
  the President <i>by pure chance</i> asked the very question for which these
  elaborate preparations had been made. People will believe this, and yet
  accuse Spiritualists of credulity. Can anyone who has the least conception of
  what is probable or possible accept such an explanation? It is only in
  psychic and preternatural (not supernatural) regions that such things really
  do become commonplace.</p>

  <p>Again, a friend reports:</p>

  <p>"One day a sceptic called upon him. Houdini read the man's hand,
  prognosticated his future, and pronounced his past from a mere reading of his
  face, having only been told the day of his birth. This was done with an
  accuracy and vividness which astonished the subject."</p>

  <p>This sounds like possible clairvoyance, but is hardly in the repertoire of
  the conjurer.</p>

  <p>There were many indications that Houdini possessed that psychic
  sensibility which is the groundwork of mediumship, though it really
  indicates, in my opinion, an unusual degree of soul power in the subject
  itself, without necessarily implying any outside assistance. All
  thought-reading seems to come under this category. On one occasion Pulitzer,
  the famous proprietor of the <i>New York World</i>, had been interested in
  the telepathic results obtained by Professor Gilbert Murray in England.
  Houdini dashed in, in his usual impetuous fashion, and claimed that he could
  duplicate them. A committee assembled in his own house, and put him to the
  test, they sitting on the ground floor, and he being locked up in a room at
  the top of the house, with the door guarded. Out of four tests he got three
  more or less correctly. When asked for an explanation he refused to answer,
  save to say that it was "scientific trickery." As usual he took it for
  granted that the Press and public would readily accept his explanation, and
  experience showed that he was right.</p>

  <p>If once the mind is adjusted to the false assumption that psychic powers
  do not exist, then all reasoning power seems to become atrophied, as is the
  case in all bigoted religions. As an example it was said, and is said, again
  and again, "How absurd for Doyle to attribute possible psychic powers to a
  man who himself denies them!" Is it not perfectly evident that if he did not
  deny them his occupation would have been gone for ever? What would his
  brother- magicians have to say to a man who admitted that half his tricks
  were done by what they would regard as illicit powers? It would be "exit
  Houdini."</p>

  <p>Now, having considered some of Houdini's inexplicable powers, let us turn
  to his direct relations with Spiritualism.</p><br>

  <h3>PART II</h3>

  <p class="first">In public, as is notorious, he posed as the uncompromising
  foe of Spiritualism. It is useless to pretend that it was only the fake
  medium that he was after. We are all out after that scoundrel, and ready to
  accept any honest help in our search for him. Houdini wrote in the
  <i>Christian Register</i> of July, 1925:</p>

  <p>"Tell the people that all I am trying to do is to save them from being
  tricked in their grief and sorrows, and to persuade them to leave
  Spiritualism alone and take up some genuine religion."</p>

  <p>Thus his attack was a general one upon the whole cult.</p>

  <p>But this was not in the least his attitude in private. I suppose that
  there are few leaders of the movement, and few known mediums, who have not
  letters of his taking the tone that he was a sympathetic inquirer who needed
  but a little more to be convinced. His curious mentality caused him to ignore
  absolutely the experiences of anyone else, but he seemed to be enormously
  impressed if anything from an outside source came in his own direction. On
  one occasion he showed me a photograph which he had taken in California. "I
  believe it to be the only genuine spirit photograph ever taken!" he cried. To
  my mind, it was a very doubtful one, and one which no sane Spiritualist would
  have passed for a moment. But, in any case, if his was, as he claimed,
  genuine, why should he put down all others to fraud? He had another which he
  showed me with some disgust, but which seemed to me to be capable of a real
  psychic explanation, however unlikely. The sensitive film had been torn
  lengthways right down the plate, just as a sharp nail would have done. He
  assured me that he had put it into the carrier quite intact. It might, of
  course, have been some singular accident, or it might conceivably have been a
  sign of the same sort of disapproval, which was a possible explanation of the
  gravel-throwing in the music-hall of Boston.</p>

  <p>His experience with decent mediums was exceedingly limited. He sat several
  times with Eva during the abortive investigation by the London Psychical
  Research Society. He wrote to me at the time, saying: "I found it highly
  interesting." There was no question of any exposure, and he admitted that he
  saw ectoplasm both come and go without being able to explain it. I believe
  that he once&mdash;and only once&mdash;sat with that great voice medium, Mrs.
  Wriedt, on which occasion nothing at all occurred, as will happen with all
  honest mediums, but does not happen with conjurers. There was certainly no
  talk of any exposure. He never sat with Miss Besinnet, nor with Mrs. Pruden,
  nor with Jonson of Pasadena, nor with Hope, nor with Mrs. Deane, nor with
  Evan Powell, nor Phoenix, nor Sloane. He claimed to have exposed P.L.O.
  Keeler, a medium whom I have heard quoted, but of whom I have no personal
  experience. Speaking generally, it may be said that his practical experience,
  save with a class of people whom a decent Spiritualist would neither use nor
  recommend, was very limited. His theoretical knowledge of the subject was
  also limited, for though he possessed an excellent library, it was, when I
  inspected it, neither catalogued nor arranged. I am told that his library was
  eventually put upon a more satisfactory basis, but I speak of it as I saw it.
  His book, <i>A Magician among the Spirits</i>, is full of errors of fact, and
  never for a moment did he show any appreciation of the higher religious
  claims of the movement.</p>

  <p>In spite of this very limited basis, he gave the public the impression
  that his knowledge was profound. To one reporter he said that he had attended
  ten thousand s&eacute;ances. I pointed out at the time that this would mean
  one a day for thirty years. His accusations against Spiritualists were
  equally wild. A man, named Frank Macdowell, committed a peculiarly atrocious
  murder at Clearwater in Florida. Houdini broadcast the fact that it was due
  to spirit teaching. Fortunately, a resolute Spiritualist, Mr. Elliot Hammond,
  went into the matter, and showed clearly that the murderer gave his complete
  disbelief in life after death to have been at the root of his actions.
  Spiritualism would have saved him.</p>

  <p>I repeat that Houdini's attitude in private was quite different (to) what
  it was in public. At one time we had him really converted without the
  slightest intention of causing such a result. It was at Atlantic City, in
  1922. He had spoken in a touching manner of his mother, so my wife, who has
  the great gift of inspired writing&mdash;that is, of writing which appears to
  be quite disconnected from her own mentality&mdash;tried if she could get any
  message for him. It was done at my suggestion, and I well remember that my
  wife needed much persuasion. We had no sooner assembled in our quiet
  sitting-room than the power came, and the medium began to write with
  breathless and extraordinary speed, covering sheet after sheet, which I tore
  off and threw across to Houdini at the other side of the table. We gathered
  that it was a moving and impassioned message to her son from the dead mother.
  He asked a mental question of his mother without speech, and the medium's
  hand instantly wrote what he admitted to be an answer. Houdini was deeply
  moved, and there is no question that at the time he entirely accepted it.</p>

  <p>When we met him two days later in New York, he said to us: "I have been
  walking on air ever since." I published the incident in my <i>American
  Adventure,</i> so that he had to explain it away to fit it into his anti-
  Spiritualistic campaign. The line of criticism which he took was that it
  could not have been from his mother, since a cross was put upon the top of
  the paper, and she was a Jewess. If he had cared to inquire we could have
  shown him that the medium <i>always</i> puts a cross on the top of her paper,
  as being a holy symbol. We consider that such exercises are, in the highest
  degree, religious. That is a complete answer to the objection.</p>

  <p>His second criticism was that the letter was in English. This was
  plausible, but shows an ignorance of psychic methods. If a medium were in
  complete trance, it might well be possible to get an unknown tongue through
  her. Such cases are not very rare; but when the medium is not in trance, but
  writing by inspiration, it is the flood of thought and of emotion which
  strikes her, and has to be translated by her in her own vocabulary as best
  she can. As an illustration, I have notes of a case where two mediums in the
  same room both got an inspired message at the same moment. They each wrote
  down the same sense, but the wording was quite different. Thus the second
  criticism falls to the ground. In any case, one would imagine that he would
  have nothing but respect and gratitude for one who tried to help him, with no
  conceivable advantage to herself. No sign of this appears. It is the same
  queer mental twist which caused him first to take the name of the great
  Frenchman, and then to write a whole book, <i>The Unmasking of Houdin</i>, to
  prove that he was a fraud.</p>

  <p>But there was another very curious and suggestive incident in connection
  with that sitting at Atlantic City. As Houdini, much moved, rose from the
  table, he took up the pencil, and, bending to the papers, he said: "I wonder
  if I could do anything at this!" The pencil moved and he wrote one word. Then
  he looked up at me and I was amazed, for I saw in his eyes that look,
  impossible to imitate, which comes to the medium who is under influence. The
  eyes look at you, and yet you feel that they are not focused upon you. Then I
  took up the paper. He had written upon it the one word, "Powell." My friend,
  Ellis Powell, had just died in England, so the name had a meaning. "Why,
  Houdini," I cried, "Saul is among the prophets! You are a medium." Houdini
  had a poker-face and gave nothing away as a rule, but he seemed to me to be
  disconcerted by my remark. He muttered something about knowing a man called
  "Powell" down in Texas, though he failed to invent any reason why that
  particular man should come back at that particular moment. Then, gathering up
  the papers, he hurried from the room. It is probable that at that moment I
  had surprised the master secret of his life&mdash;a secret which even those
  who were nearest to him had never quite understood. Each fact alone may be
  capable of explanation, but when a dozen facts all point in the same
  direction, then surely there is a case to answer.</p>

  <p>I have said that the Houdini mentality was the most obscure that I have
  ever known. Consider this manifestation of it. My wife and I were, as I have
  shown, endeavouring to help him, with no possible motive save to give him
  such consolation as we could, since he was always saying that he wished to
  get in touch with his mother. Such consolation has often been given to
  others. Even if we suppose, for argument's sake, that we were mistaken in our
  views, we were, as he often admits, in dead earnest. Then, as we rose, he
  wrote down the name Powell, which meant much to me. If it was not written
  under psychic influence, why should he write anything at all, since no one
  asked him to do so? He saw the difficulty when he had to explain it away, so
  in his book he says that it was a "deliberate mystification" upon his part,
  and that he wrote it entirely of his own volition. Thus by his own showing,
  while we were honest with him, he was playing what I will charitably describe
  as a practical joke upon us. Is it any wonder that we look back at the
  incident with some bitterness? He does not attempt to explain how it was that
  out of all his friends the name that he wrote was the very one which might
  well have wished to come through to me. There is a limit to coincidence.</p>

  <p>It is a curious fact that neither my wife nor I knew what was in the
  mother's letter until I read it in his book. It was written so swiftly that
  the medium, in her half-unconscious state, could at best only have a very
  vague idea of its purport, while I never even glanced at it. Now that I read
  it, it seems to me to be a very beautiful letter, full of love and of
  longing. As I have explained, the thoughts are given and are largely
  translated by the medium. Therefore, there are some sentences in which I can
  recognize my wife's style of expression, but the greater part of it is far
  more fervid&mdash;one might almost say more Oriental&mdash;than anything I
  have known my wife do. Here is a short extract:</p>

  <p>"Oh, my darling, my darling, thank God at last I am through. I've tried,
  oh, so often. Now I am happy. Of course, I want to talk to my boy, my own
  beloved boy... My only shadow has been that my beloved one has not known how
  often I have been with him all the while... I want him only to know that
  &mdash;that&mdash;I have bridged the gulf&mdash;that is what I wanted
  &mdash;oh, so much. Now I can rest in peace."</p>

  <p>It was a long and very moving message and bore every internal sign of
  being genuine. There is no question at all in my mind that Houdini was
  greatly shaken at the time and for some days afterwards. His objections were
  all afterthoughts in order to save the situation.</p>

  <p>In the account of the matter which Houdini gave, he lays stress upon the
  fact that Mrs. Houdini had spoken to my wife the night before as to Houdini's
  affairs, with many details as to his habits when with his mother. Now if the
  message had really come from my wife's subconscious self I think it is
  certain that some of this information would have come through. I have known
  this to happen in the case of perfectly honest mediums and for this reason it
  is better never to tell a medium anything at all before a s&eacute;ance. A
  blank slate is the best to write upon. In the long message, however, which my
  wife gave there was no trace at all of the knowledge which she had normally
  gained, and which could have been used so effectively if anyone had been so
  wicked as to play a trick. This is, I think, a very clear sign that the
  message was not subconscious but did really come from the source it claimed.
  Houdini's objection that the mother made no mention of the fact that it was
  her own birthday has no relevancy. What are birthdays on the other side? It
  is the death day which is the real birthday. In her rush of joy and emotion
  why should she pause to mention such a fact? The method in which Houdini
  tried to explain away, minimize and contort our attempt at consolation, which
  was given entirely at his own urgent request and against my wife's desire,
  has left a deplorable shadow in my mind which made some alteration in my
  feelings towards him. Conscious as I was of his many excellent and wonderful
  qualities, such incidents took the edge off my sympathies, and put a strain
  upon our friendship.</p>

  <p>When my friend, the late Miss Scatcherd, was in New York, some years ago,
  she saw a good deal of Houdini, and got, I fancy, as nearly into his complete
  confidence as anyone could do. To her, as to me, he showed no animosity to
  psychic things, but, on the contrary, he was eager to show her the one and
  only true medium whom he had discovered in America. Miss Scatcherd was not, I
  gather, much impressed by his find, having known many better ones. She did
  not fail, however, to point out to him that in admitting the one medium he
  had really given away his whole case, and agreed that the Spiritualists had a
  solid foundation for their cult. She then accused him of being a powerful
  medium himself, for she was a strong sensitive, and all her psychic powers
  told her that he was the same. She also scolded him in her charming,
  good-natured way for having behaved shamefully in the "Margery" case, which
  he did not deny. The climax came, however, when, far out on the Atlantic, she
  received the following wireless message:</p>

  <p>"From a sensitive to a sensitive. Wishing you a pleasant voyage. &mdash;
  Houdini."</p>

  <p>A sensitive is a medium, and what is the logic of denouncing all mediums
  as frauds from the public platforms, and at the same time declaring in a
  telegram that you are one yourself?</p>

  <p>Let us now follow a fresh line of thought. There can be no question at
  all, to anyone who has really weighed the facts, that Ira Davenport was a
  true medium. Apart from the evidence of thousands of witnesses, it is
  self-evident that he could at any time, by announcing himself and his brother
  as conjurers, and doing his unique performances as tricks, have won fame and
  fortune. This would seem a dreadful thing to do from the point of view of a
  good Spiritualist, and the Davenports went to the last possible limit by
  leaving the source of their powers to the audience to determine. Houdini has
  endeavoured to take advantage of this and to make out that Ira admitted in
  his old age that his feats were tricks. To clear away such an idea, I append
  the following letter, written by Ira in 1868 to <i>The Banner of
  Light:</i></p>

  <p>"It is singular that any individual, sceptic or Spiritualist, could
  believe such statements after fourteen years of the most bitter persecution,
  culminating in the riots of Liverpool, Huddersfield, and Leeds, where our
  lives were placed in imminent peril by the fury of brutal mobs, our property
  destroyed, all because we would not renounce Spiritualism and declare
  ourselves jugglers when threatened by the mob and urged to do so. In
  conclusion, we denounce all such statements as base falsehoods."</p>

  <p>We happen to be particularly well informed about the Davenports, for,
  apart from long statements from many well-known people who examined them,
  there are three books by people who knew them well, and who could not
  possibly have been deceived had they been swindlers. The smaller book, by
  Orrin Abbott, covers the early days, and the author tells how he was intimate
  with the brothers when they were little boys, and how at that time he had
  every opportunity of observing and testing their wonderful powers. These
  seem, as is often the case with mediums, to have been stronger in childhood
  than in later life, the power of levitation being one which Abbott witnessed,
  but which is not recorded of them elsewhere. The second and fullest is Dr.
  Nicol's biography, while the third and most valuable is found in the
  <i>Supramundane Facts</i> of the Rev. J.B. Ferguson. Ferguson was a man of
  very high character, with a notable record behind him, and he travelled with
  the Davenports during their tour in England. He was with them at all hours of
  the day and night, and he has left it on record that their experiences when
  in private were quite as wonderful as anything that the public ever saw. It
  is notable that these well- attested feats included not only the instant
  freedom from ropes, however carefully fastened and sealed by the spectators,
  but also, on occasion, the freedom from handcuffs or twisted wire, and the
  power of opening locked doors. In a word, the Davenport powers were the
  Houdini powers, save that the latter had physical strength and agility which
  may have helped him to extend them.</p>

  <p>My argument now begins to emerge. If it be true that the Davenports were
  real mediums (and let the inquirer really read their record before he denies
  it),[Footnote: It will be found epitomized in my <i>History of
  Spiritualism</i> (Cassell)] and if Houdini produced exactly similar results,
  which have in each case been inexplicable to their contemporaries, then is it
  conceivable that they were produced in entirely different ways? If Ira
  Davenport was a medium, then there is a strong prim&acirc; facie case that
  Houdini was a medium too. Now we come upon some explanation of the cryptic
  saying of the rabbi by the graveside: "He possessed a wondrous power that he
  never understood, and which he never revealed to anyone in life." What could
  that power be, save what we have called the power of the medium?</p>

  <p>A singular incident is narrated by Mrs. Houdini and is incorporated in Mr.
  Kellock's biography. Shortly after his marriage, Houdini took his girl wife
  and his brother to a lonely place, where he halted them upon a bridge at
  midnight. When the hour came he made them both raise their hands in the air
  and said to them, "Beatrice, Dash, raise your hands to heaven and swear that
  both of you will be true to me. Never betray me in any way, so help you God!"
  I would not put too much stress upon this incident. It may have been the
  considered act of one who already had some strange and secret knowledge which
  he foresaw might be used in the future and might be surprised by those around
  him.</p>

  <p>I would not, in probing this difficult problem, pass too lightly over the
  considered words of the rabbi, that he had a wondrous power and did not
  himself understand it. This phrase fits very exactly into what has been
  stated to me by those who were nearest to him in life. "If it was so, he did
  not know it," they have answered when I hinted at my conclusions. It seems
  hard to comprehend, and yet there may be something in this view. He was not a
  clear thinker, and he had no logical process in his mind. That surely is
  evident when in the same breath he denies all mediumship and claims to have
  discovered the greatest medium in America; or when he scoffs at spirit
  pictures but brings me a very indifferent one which he had taken himself.
  Imagine that such a man finds himself one minute inside a box; there is an
  interval of semi-trance during which his mind is filled with a vague feeling
  of confused effort, and then he finds himself outside the box. There is no
  obvious intervention of spirits, or of any outside force, but it just happens
  so. He has the same power in emerging from fetters, but he has no sort of
  philosophy by which he can explain such things. If we could imagine such a
  very strange and unlikely state of things as that, it would, at least, have
  the merit that it would give some sort of honest and rational explanation of
  a good deal which at present is dark. It is no unusual thing for a medium to
  fail to understand his own results, but it would certainly seem almost
  incredible that anyone could have such results for many years and never
  correlate them with the experience of others. I, as his former friend, would
  welcome such an explanation if it could be sustained.</p>

  <p>But how does the good rabbi know that he did not understand it? Only one
  man could say with authority, but he has passed away with closed lips,
  leaving, however, many signs behind for those who have the wit to follow
  them. There is one thing certain, and that is that the fate of the Davenports
  must have been a perpetual warning to Houdirii. They had been ruined and
  hunted off the stage because it was thought that their claim was psychic. If
  his powers were to be drawn from that source, and if he were to avoid a
  similar fate, then his first and fundamental law must be that it be
  camouflaged in every possible way, and that no one at all should know his
  secret. If this be granted, a great many disconnected points become at once a
  connected whole. We see what he meant when he said that his own wife did not
  know how he produced his effects. We understand the voice of which he spoke.
  We comprehend dimly the unknown power of the rabbi. We can even imagine that
  a campaign against mediums, fortified by the knowledge that false mediums do
  exist, would be an excellent smoke-screen, though probably he had never
  thought out what view the unseen powers might take of suctfa transaction, any
  more than he calculated upon the interposition of Walter in the case of the
  conspiracy against the Crandons. I cannot say that all this is certain. I can
  only say that it covers the facts as I know them.</p>

  <p>Of course, I know that he had a trick-box. I know also who constructed it,
  and the large amount that he paid for it. When I know also that he could do
  his escapes equally well in any local box, I am not inclined to attach much
  importance to the matter. He was a very astute man, and what he did he would
  do thoroughly, but he became too careless in his methods as he found he could
  do them with impunity.</p>

  <p>Houdini is curiously contradictory in his account of the methods of
  Davenport. In his book <i>A Magician among the Spirits</i>, he says:</p>

  <p>"Their method of releasing themselves was simple. When one extended his
  feet the other drew his in, thus securing slack enough in the wrist rope to
  permit working their hands out of the loops. The second brother was released
  by reversing the action,"</p>

  <p>But, as I have shown, in a letter to me he said:</p>

  <p>"I know for a positive fact that it was not essential for them to release
  the bonds in order to obtain manifestations."</p>

  <p>So the previous explanation would seem to have been a fake in order to
  conceal the real one.</p>

  <p>In another letter he says:</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot say that all of their work was accomplished by
  spirits."</p>

  <p>The "all" is suggestive. I would be the last to suggest that all of
  Davenport's or indeed that all of Houdini's work could be due to spirits. For
  that matter, we have to remember that we are ourselves spirits here and now,
  and that a man may very well be producing psychic effects without going
  beyond his own organism. It is in this sense that I suspect the Houdini
  results as being psychic, and I do not at all insist upon the interposition
  of outside forces.. The two things are not far apart, however, and very
  easily slide into each other. There is, I hold, the medium's use of his own
  power, there is a vague borderland, and there is a wide world beyond where
  his power is used by forces outside himself. I am convinced, for example,
  that raps may be produced voluntarily by a medium by a psychic effort, and I
  am equally convinced that at another stage these same raps may be used for
  purposes quite beyond his knowledge or control.</p>

  <p>Is it possible for a man to be a very powerful medium all his life, to use
  that power continually, and yet never to realize that the gifts he is using
  are those which the world calls mediumship? If that be indeed possible, then
  we have a solution of the Houdini enigma. One who knew him well and worked
  with him often wrote to me as follows:</p>

  <p>"Often he would get a difficult lock. I would stand by the cabinet and
  hear him say: 'This is beyond me.' After many minutes, when the audience
  became restless, I would say, 'If there is anything in this belief in
  Spiritism why don't you call on them to assist you?' And before many minutes
  had passed Houdini had mastered the lock. He never attributed this to psychic
  help. He just knew that that particular instrument was the one to open that
  lock, and so he did all his tricks."</p>

  <p>It is only fair to state, however, that this correspondent, who was in a
  good position to know, would not admit the mediumship. And yet if "that
  particular instrument" was, as stated, an appeal to spirits, it seems
  difficult to claim that the result was natural.</p>

  <p>I would not limit my hypothesis to the idea that it was only when he met
  the Davenports that he first developed these strange powers. He seems only to
  have met Ira in 1909, and he had certainly done many marvellous feats himself
  before then. But the history and object-lesson of the Davenports must have
  been well known to him, and have shown him what to avoid.</p>

  <p>In putting forward such a view as I have here expressed it is natural that
  a critic should demand that I should show that similar results to those of
  Houdini have actually been produced by psychic power. Of this there can be no
  possible doubt upon the part of anyone who has studied the subject. I have
  already mentioned the case of the Davenports who were so badly treated by the
  English mob, and so maligned by Maskelyne and other English conjurers who
  produced a feeble imitation of their results and called it an exposure. They
  freed themselves with the greatest ease from metal bands as well as from the
  tightest ligatures. Such results can only be obtained by the passage of
  matter through matter&mdash;of the wrist for example through the metal
  &mdash;and though such a thing may seem inconceivable to the prosaic
  scientist of to-day, he would have pronounced wireless or flying to be
  equally impossible a generation or so in the past. We seem to need no spirit
  intervention here, but to be within the region of the latent powers of the
  human organism in peculiarly constituted individuals. There is, I believe, a
  constructive and a destructive power in thought alone which is akin to that
  "faith which moves mountains." What sort of a vibration it can be which is
  shot out from the human brain and separates for a moment the molecules of
  that solid object towards which it is directed I do not know, but the results
  are clear and perhaps in the near future the cause may become equally so.
  From personal observation I have assured myself that mediums in sealed bonds
  can cast those bonds, walk about the room, and be found later with the sealed
  bonds as before. If they could get out by a trick I see no way in which they
  could get back. I am forced, therefore, to predicate the existence of such a
  dematerializing and reconstructing force, which would amply cover most of the
  phenomena both of the Davenports and of Houdini. Such a force was
  demonstrated also in the experiments which were made with Slade by
  Z&ouml;llner and three other German professors, and described by him in his
  <i>Transcendental Physics</i>. In this book many instances, closely observed,
  of the passage of matter through matter were recorded, accompanied by the
  interesting observation that the phenomenon was accompanied often by heat and
  a strong smell of burning.[Footnote: <i>Transcendental Physics</i>, by Prof.
  Z&ouml;llner (English translation) p.113 ] Bellachini, the Court conjurer,
  deposed that the results he saw were out of the region of conjuring
  altogether.[Footnote: <i>Vide</i> appendix of the above book.] But suppose
  that Slade had gone round the world doing such things and allowing people to
  believe that they were tricks, while confusing the public by mixing them up
  with real tricks, would not his position have been very close to that of
  Houdini? We come, however, upon a more advanced class of phenomenon when we
  consider the case of the passage of a human body through a solid obstacle and
  its reassembly on the other side. If I can show that such cases have upon
  most unquestionable evidence occurred then I shall have got a possible line
  upon Houdini's performance. In the April number of <i>Psychic Science</i>
  there is the report by an American lady, Mrs. Hack, of the phenomena at a
  circle sitting in the Castle Millesimo, which is near Genoa. Mrs. Hack was
  herself present, as were the well-known Professor Bozzano, and other
  first-class witnesses. The Marquis Centurione Scotto, the owner of the
  castle, was one of the company. Suddenly in the midst of the proceedings he
  vanished from his chair. His friends were horrified. They searched the room
  and the castle, but he was gone. Finally, after hours of agitation he was
  found in a deep trance in an outhouse, which was separated by several locked
  doors from the main building. He was led back; and had no recollection how he
  had got there. Such in a few words is the gist of a case which was closely
  observed and fully reported. In it a human body is passed through several
  solid obstacles and reassembled on the other side. How does this differ from
  the passage of Houdini's body through wooden planks, brick walls, paper bags,
  glass tanks, or whatever else was used to confine him?[Footnote: These
  remarkable experiences are more fully described in Mrs. Hack's <i>Modern
  Psychic Mysteries</i> (Rider). ]</p>

  <p>In Mr. Campbell Holms' book, <i>The Facts of Psychic Science</i>, which
  is, and will be always, a most exact and valuable book of reference, there
  are a number of cases given where people have been transported through solid
  objects. Inexperienced and foolish people may jeer, but they will find it
  easier to do so than to refute the evidence. For example, upon June 3rd,
  1871, Mrs. Guppy was floated from her own house in Highbury, and appeared
  upon the table of a room at 61 Lambs Conduit Street, where a s&eacute;ance
  was being held behind locked doors. A document was signed by the eleven
  sitters to testify to the fact and they had no possible object in perjuring
  themselves about the matter. Mrs. Guppy said that the last thing she could
  remember was sitting with her friend Miss Neyland. That lady deposed that
  Mrs. Guppy had suddenly vanished from her sight. Four of the sitters
  accompanied Mrs. Guppy home and heard what her friend had to say. It is
  difficult to find any flaw in such evidence and it would certainly have been
  conclusive in a court of law had it been a criminal case. But surely such a
  transposition is more remarkable than any of Houdini's, and had she done
  similar things in public her reputation would have been similar to his
  own.</p>

  <p>In another case, that of Mr. Henderson, a photographer, quoted by Mr.
  Campbell Holms and described in the <i>Spiritual Magazine</i> of 1874 (p.
  22), no less than ten persons saw him vanish from a room, while nine others
  deposed to his arrival almost instantaneously at a point more than a mile
  distant. The idea that these nineteen witnesses can be disregarded is surely
  an impossible one, and yet here again we have evidence of the possibility by
  psychic means of passing a human body through solid obstacles by a process of
  dematerialisation and reassembly. I could quote a number of other cases, but
  the sum of it all is that Houdini's exploits, which are inexplicable in any
  other way, come into line at once if we compare them with other well-attested
  examples of psychic power. When one adds this evidence to the various other
  indications of similar powers which I have assembled here, the case seems to
  me to be greatly strengthened.</p>

  <p>That Houdini's performances were on a different level from those of other
  magicians is shown by the fact that men who took a pride in fathoming such
  problems, and who were usually successful, were utterly foiled in their
  attempts to explain them in any reasonable way. Thus Mr. H. L. Adam, an
  English journalist who is an expert in such matters, writes to me that he
  could understand much that was done by Maskelyne and others, but</p>

  <p>"I have never been able to discover anything about Houdini's tricks. Why?
  I have stood quite near him on the stage during the performances of many of
  his tricks, but it was like looking at a brick wall, so impenetrable were
  they. I remember on one occasion, while Houdini was waiting at the side of
  the stage ready for his 'turn,' he sat in a chair, threw his head back,
  closed his eyes, and appeared plunged in the profoundest meditations. A few
  moments before he had been talking confidentially to me. After the lapse of
  perhaps ten minutes, he 'came to' and continued his conversation with me as
  though nothing had intervened."</p>

  <p>"Houdini once suggested to me that he should, by way of advertisement,
  profess to 'give away' his handcuff trick, which I was to publish. But it
  struck me that the volunteered so-called explanation, which included a hidden
  key, was too feeble to be convincing, and it was never developed. This was
  the nearest approach he ever came to discussing any of his secrets with
  me."</p>

  <p>Here again in that trance-like condition before a performance we seem to
  get a glimpse of some psychic influence.</p>

  <p>Houdini continually admitted that there were psychic things which he could
  not understand. I would say in parenthesis that one may be a strong medium
  oneself and yet have very small understanding of other people's phenomena.
  That was conspicuous in the case of D. D. Home. Here is a Houdini story told
  by Don Ryan[Footnote: <i>New York American</i>, February 11th, 1928.]:</p>

  <p>"Houdini had gone in a spiritualist church in Los Angeles, taking a
  camera-man, who carried a camera concealed. They made themselves
  inconspicuous till the witching hour at which the ghost was accustomed to
  walk. The hour came and with it the spirit. The leader of the group was
  holding conversation with the invisible spirit when the camera was trained on
  the spot without the knowledge of anybody save Houdini and his
  photographer.</p>

  <p>"The developed plate which Houdini showed me revealed a well-defined
  transparent human figure draped in white.</p>

  <p>"'I can't explain it and I don't know what to think of it,' said Houdini
  that day, and I could see that the thing had made a decided impression on
  him.</p>

  <p>"'It's no more astonishing than your staying under water for an hour and a
  half in a lead-lined coffin,' I told him.</p>

  <p>"'Ah,' replied Houdini,' but I know how that is done.'"</p>

  <p>The attempts upon the part of his brother-magicians to give some sort of
  explanation of Houdini's feats only serve to deepen the mystery. Mr. Howard
  Thurston, for whose opinion I have respect, for he seemed to me to be the
  only American conjurer who had some real accurate knowledge of psychic
  matters, says that his feats all come within the power of advanced conjuring.
  I know that feats with the same name do so, but I venture to express the
  opinion that such feats as Houdini did have never been explained and are in
  an altogether different class. So too, Mr. Will Goldston, who is well known
  and respected as an authority on conjuring, has actually described in a book
  how they are done. Here again he seems to me to be describing the accepted
  method, which by no means covers Houdini's results. To show the inadequacy of
  Mr. Goldston's "explanations"[Footnote: <i>Sunday Express</i>, November 7th,
  1926. ] he says in talking of the escape under water, "Without giving away
  his secrets I may say that he was always practically out of the box before it
  reached the water." Considering that the screwed and corded box was in full
  sight of hundreds of spectators as it sank beneath the waves, it is difficult
  to accept such a solution as this. I admit that I am at a disadvantage when
  opposed to the technical knowledge of such men as Goldston and Thurston, but
  on the other hand I have my own technical and expert knowledge of psychic
  possibilities, and I put up a case for consideration and discussion.</p>

  <p>He had, as already stated, a sitting with the medium Eva, and under the
  stringent and very deterrent conditions imposed by the London Psychical
  Research Society, which will be found described in their unsatisfactory and
  self-contradictory report, he did seem to have made acquaintance with
  ectoplasm in its very humblest form. He says in a letter to me written the
  next morning (June 22nd, 1920):</p>

  <p>"They made Eva drink a cup of coffee and eat some cake (I presume to fill
  her up with some food-stuff), and after she had been sewn into the tights,
  and a net over her face, she manifested.</p>

  <p>1. "Some froth-like substance, inside of net, 'twas long, about five
  inches, she said it was elevated, but none of us four watchers saw it
  'elevate.'</p>

  <p>2. "A white plaster-looking affair over her right eye.</p>

  <p>3. "Something that looked like a small face, say four inches in
  circumference. Was terra-cotta coloured, and Dingwall, who held her hands,
  had the best look at the 'object.'</p>

  <p>4. "Some substance, froth-like, exuding from her nose, and Baggeley and
  Fielding say it protrudes from her nose, but Dingwall and I are positive that
  it was inside of net and was not extending from her nose, as I had the best
  view from two different places I deliberately took advantage to see just what
  it was.</p>

  <p>5. "Medium asked permission to remove something in her mouth, show her
  hands empty, and took out what appeared to be a rubberish substance, which
  she disengaged, showed us plainly, we held the electric torch, all saw it
  plainly, when presto! it vanished. It was a surprise effect indeed! The
  s&eacute;ance started at 7.30 and lasted past midnight.</p>

  <p>"We went over the notes, and no doubt you will get a full report. I found
  it highly interesting."</p>

  <p>It will be found from these extracts that when faced with facts his
  attitude was very different from what his public utterances would lead one to
  expect.</p>

  <p>Be his mystery what it may, Houdini was one of the most remarkable men of
  whom we have any record, and he will live in history with such personalities
  as Cagliostro, the Chevalier D'Eon, and other strange characters. He had many
  outstanding qualities, and the world is the poorer for his loss. As matters
  stand, no one can say positively and finally that his powers were abnormal,
  but the reader will, I hope, agree with me that there is a case to be
  answered.</p><br>

     id="chap2">THE SHADOWS ON THE SCREEN</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, May 1920<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">There is nothing more wonderful, more incredible, and at the
  same time, as it seems to me, more certain, than that past events may leave a
  record upon our surroundings which is capable of making itself felt, heard,
  or seen for a long time afterwards. I have put the impressions in the order
  of their frequency, for it is more common to feel the past than to hear it
  and more common to hear it than to see it. Houses which are haunted by vague
  noises are more common than those which possess apparitions, and families
  have been persecuted for years by poltergeists who have never once caught a
  glimpse of their tormentors.</p>

  <p>A sensitive mind is easily affected in any place where there has been
  recent trouble. A lady of my acquaintance called recently upon the matron of
  a hospital and found that she was not in her room. "Mrs. Dodson has gone
  out," said the nurse. "Has she had bad news?" "Yes, she has just had a wire
  that her husband is very ill." How did my friend know that there had been bad
  news? She felt it by a sinking of her own heart as she entered the room,
  before the nurse had arrived. "Telepathy!" says the parrot. Well, if
  telepathy can be stretched to mean that a thought or emotion can not only be
  flashed from brain to brain, but that it can remain stationary for an hour
  and then impress itself upon any sensitive who approached it, then I will not
  quarrel with the word. But if for an hour why not for a year, and if for a
  year why not for a century? There is a record on the etheric screen so that
  it may retain indefinitely some intimate and lasting change which marks and
  can even faintly reproduce the emotion which a human being has endured within
  it.</p>

  <p>I had a friend who lived in a century-old house. His wife, who was
  sensitive, was continually aware of a distinct push when she came down the
  stairs, always occurring upon the same step. Afterwards it was discovered
  that an old lady who had formerly lived in the house received a playful push
  from some frolicsome child, and lost her balance, falling down the stairs. It
  is not necessary to believe that some hobgoblin lingered upon that stair
  continually repeating the fatal action. The probable explanation seems to be
  that the startled mind of the old woman as she felt herself falling left some
  permanent effect behind it which could still be discerned in this strange
  fashion.</p>

  <p>But on what could an impression be left? An impression of such a nature
  becomes a material thing and implies a material nexus, however subtle. So far
  as we know there are only two things there, the air and the ether. The air is
  a mobile thing and could not carry a permanent impression. But is the ether a
  mobile thing? It is pictured as a most delicate medium with vibrating
  currents flowing in it, but it seems to me that a most tenuous jelly with
  quivers and thrills would be a closer analogy. We could conceive the whole
  material universe embedded in and interpenetrated by this subtle material,
  which would not necessarily change its position since it is too fine for wind
  or any coarser material to influence it. I feel that I am rushing in where
  even Lodges fear to tread, but if it should prove to be as I suggest then we
  should have that permanent screen on which shadows are thrown. The block of
  ether upon the stairs is the same that it always was, and so conveys the
  impression from the past.</p>

  <p>Invisible air records of this sort would explain many things which are now
  inexplicable. Men of strong nerve have been known to be terrified in certain
  localities without being able to give any reason. Some horror of the past,
  unseen by their eyes, may still have impressed their senses. One does not
  need to be very psychic to get the same result upon an old battlefield. I am
  by no means psychic myself, and yet I am conscious, quite apart from
  imagination, of a curious effect, almost a darkening of the landscape with a
  marked sense of heaviness, when I am on an old battlefield. I have been
  particularly conscious of it on the scenes of Hastings and Culloden, two
  fights where great causes were finally destroyed and where extreme bitterness
  may well have filled the hearts of the conquered. The shadow still remains. A
  more familiar example of the same faculty is the gloom which gathers over the
  mind of even an average person upon entering certain houses. The most rabid
  agitator need not envy our nobility their stately old castles, for it is
  happier to spend one's life in the simplest cottage, uncontaminated by
  psychic disturbance, than to live in the grandest mansion which still
  preserves the gloomy taints that hang about rooms once perhaps the scene of
  cruelty or other vices.</p>

  <p>If a sensitive is able to feel some record of a past event, then there is
  evidence that by an extension of this process one who is still more sensitive
  would actually see the person who left the impression. That it is the actual
  person in spirit is in most cases utterly incredible to me. That the victim
  of some century-old villainy should still in her ancient garments frequent in
  person the scene of her former martyrdom is, indeed, hard to believe. It is
  more credible, little as we understand the details, that some thought-form is
  shed and remains visible, at the spot where great mental agony has been
  endured. "How" and "why" are questions which will be solved by our
  descendants. If we could conceive that we have form within form like the
  skins of an onion, that the outer skin should peel off under the influence of
  emotion and continue a mechanical existence at that spot while the rest of
  the organism passed on and never even missed it, such a supposition, farcical
  as it appears, would match the recorded facts better than anything else I
  know. Each fresh discarded skin of the onion would be a fresh thought-form,
  and our track through life would be marked in its more emotional crises by a
  long trail of such forms. Grotesque as the idea may seem, I can confidently
  say that the true explanation when it arrives will prove to be not less
  so.</p>

  <p>Let us now take some definite examples where this thought-form of the past
  has manifested itself. I do not know a better case than that which is
  recorded by the late Miss Goodrich-Freer, a lady who combined a steady nerve
  and cool judgment with a temperament which was conservative to the point of
  incredulity. She slept in a room in Hampton Court Palace which had a record
  of haunting, and she tells us very clearly what occurred. No unprejudiced
  person could possibly read the original narrative without being absolutely
  convinced that the facts were even as stated.</p>

  <p>It was a small bedroom without curtains, with one door close by the bed.
  It is characteristic of the lady that she spent her vigil&mdash;she had come
  in the hope of seeing the apparition&mdash;by reading Lord Farrer's article,
  "Shall we degrade our standard of value?" In spite of the reading, or
  possibly on account of it, she fell asleep, and was awakened some hours later
  by sounds of movement. It was quite dark, and some detaining force seemed to
  prevent her from reaching for the matches. A question received no reply.
  Suddenly there appeared a soft point of light in the gloom, which glowed and
  spread, until it became the figure of a tall, slight woman, moving slowly
  across the room. She stopped at the farther side and the observer was able to
  get a clear view of her profile. "Her face was insipidly pretty, that of a
  woman from thirty to thirty-five years of age, her figure slight, her dress
  of a dark soft material, having a full skirt and broad sash or waistband tied
  high up, a crossed or draped kerchief over the shoulders, sleeves which I
  noticed fitted very tight below the elbow, and hair which was dressed so as
  not to lie flat on the head." A second question addressed to this figure
  produced no effect. She raised her thin white hands, sank upon her knees,
  buried her face in the palms, and appeared to pray. Then the light went out
  and the scene was over. The impression left upon the observer's mind by the
  action and attitude was that of reproach, and yet of gentle resignation. Her
  own nerves were so entirely unaffected by the incident that she has left it
  on record that she spent part of the remainder of the night in reading Myers'
  <i>Drift of Psychical Research</i>. Such an experience, and it is one of a
  very numerous class, can hardly be explained rationally upon any spiritual or
  upon any physical basis. Granting the fact, and there is no sane alternative
  but to grant it, we cannot conceive that this unfortunate woman has really
  for a century or more occupied herself in walking across a room in which some
  great trouble may have befallen her in her earth-life. From her appearance
  one would judge that she was more sinned against than sinning. Why, then,
  should any just dispensation condemn her to so strange, monotonous, and
  useless a fate? If we can conceive, however, that it is some shadow of
  herself which was detached in old days of trouble, and still lingers, then
  certainly the matter becomes more clear, if she herself is happy elsewhere.
  Such a shadow, like most psychic phenomena, might well seem luminous to one
  who, like Miss Goodrich-Freer, had herself some clairvoyant gifts. If you
  ask, however, why such a thought-form should only come at certain hours, I am
  compelled to answer that I do not know.</p>

  <p>A similar first-hand example may be drawn from Mrs. Tweedale's book,
  <i>Ghosts I Have Seen</i>, which, under its popular title, contains a most
  extraordinary record of actual first-hand psychic experiences. Mrs. Tweedale
  is an admirable witness, for she, like Miss Goodrich-Freer, is herself
  clairvoyante, and yet retains a very sane and critical judgment, while her
  personal reputation and position give us every confidence in her statements.
  Materialists will never fairly face the obvious alternative that such first-
  hand accounts either mean that a person of honour has suddenly burst into a
  perfect orgy of objectless lying, or else that the statements are true. When
  a clairvoyante can clearly describe her own experiences the book becomes of
  great value, and I would only name Turvey's <i>Beginnings of Seership</i>
  among the more recent works as equalling Mrs. Tweedale's in personal
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>The writer at one time lived in an old house in the West End of London. It
  was a winter night, and she was lying half asleep when she heard a sound as
  of the crackling of parchment, and opening her eyes she saw a man seated in a
  chair in front of the fire. He was dressed in a uniform reminiscent of
  Nelson's days, with brass buttons, wore powdered hair with a black bow, and
  was staring rigidly into the glow, while he held crumpled up in his right
  hand some sort of document. He was a stately and handsome figure. For some
  hours he sat there, the fire gleaming, when it spurted up, upon the buckles
  and buttons of his dress. Finally, in the small hours of the morning he
  vanished gradually away. Several times later the lady saw the same
  apparition, and it might well be argued that it was constantly there, but
  that its perception depended upon the condition of the clairvoyante. Finally
  some religious exorcism was performed in the room and the vision was not seen
  again.</p>

  <p>This case clearly fits itself into the hypothesis advanced here, of a
  form-picture being thrown out at a time of emotion. The parchment document
  suggests a will or some other paper of importance which the officer has
  prepared or received, but which in either case may have caused him so much
  mental stress as he brooded over it in front of the fire that he threw this
  permanent record upon the screen of time. The accompaniment of appropriate
  sound is very general in such cases. Difficult as my hypothesis may seem, we
  have to remember that the only conceivable other explanations would be either
  that the man's self was there in front of the fire after a century of spirit-
  life, or that his thoughts in the spirit-world concerning an episode in his
  earth-life were so constant and vivid that they conjured up a picture in the
  room. The latter explanation might be accepted for a single episode, but when
  it is a constant matter, and when one remembers how many other reminiscences
  of earth-life such a man must have had, it is difficult to consider it
  seriously.</p>

  <p>An experience which comes under the same heading is narrated by Lady Reay
  in the same enthralling volume. She was sleeping in an ancient dwelling with
  a somewhat sinister reputation, so we may admit that her mind was prepared to
  see a ghost. The actual form of the phantom was so definite, and so exactly
  similar to that seen by independent witnesses at different times in the same
  room, that it could hardly be a figment of the brain. She was awakened by
  moaning. The room was in total darkness, but at one side was a circle of
  light, like that thrown by a magic lantern. This seems to be the psychic
  illumination, as seen by Miss Goodrich-Freer in the case already quoted.
  Several clairvoyants who habitually see it describe it as being of a metallic
  yellow. In this circle of radiance was seen a woman dressed as in the Tudor
  period, walking round the apartment, throwing herself occasionally against
  the wall, like a desperate bird in a cage, and moaning terribly. There was no
  record, so far as I know, as to who this unhappy lady may have been, but she
  was seen independently before Lady Reay saw her, but without Lady Reay's
  knowledge, by Captain Eric Streatfield when he was a little boy. I do not
  understand how one can disregard such testimony as this. Such incredulity may
  be described as scientific caution, but to those who are really aware of the
  weight of evidence now existing, it must appear mere obstinacy and
  obtuseness. When one thinks of the importance of psychic knowledge, and
  compares it with that of the bending of the light from the Hyades as it
  passes the sun, one can but marvel at the want of proportion which exalts the
  physical while it neglects the spiritual.</p>

  <p>An adventure which occurred to a friend of mine seems to come under this
  heading. His family had rented an old country house in which Nell Gwynne had
  been kept when she was the mistress of Charles II. One evening, as he
  descended the stairs, he saw cross the hall a figure which was very like a
  family nurse, whom we will call "Nannie." He cried out "Nannie!" in surprise
  and followed her, but could find no trace. Inquiry proved that the servant
  was not in the house or in the neighbourhood. My friend amused himself by
  fitting up the house with as many old prints of Nell Gwynne as he could
  collect. One day his sister visited him, and after inspecting these pictures
  she exclaimed: "Have you ever observed how like Nell Gwynne is to our
  Nannie?" There is, of course, a chance of coincidence here, but at least
  there is a strong suggestion that poor Nell, wearied and miserable, with her
  heart aching for the bustle of town, cast off some thought-form as a
  permanent record of her emotion.</p>

  <p>In all these cases there has been only one figure thrown upon the screen,
  but the matter becomes more complex when there is a group. This group
  consists in many cases of the wronger and the wronged, but as each may have
  been at the same pitch of emotion at the time of the deed, the theory of
  thought-forms being shed at such a time is not invalidated&mdash;and is, at
  any rate, more reasonable than to imagine that the guilty murderer and the
  innocent victim are involved in one common fate, which consists of an endless
  repetition of the tragedy which they once enacted. Such an idea seems to me a
  monstrous and unthinkable one.</p>

  <p>I would choose as a good example of the composite thought-form one which
  was recorded some years ago in the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>, which I have
  every reason to believe is founded on fact, though the name given, Grace
  Dundas, is a pseudonym, and the events occurred twenty years ago. In this
  very dramatic case a lady with her children occupied a lonely house upon the
  Cornish coast, and was much disturbed by a ghostly visitor who passed with a
  heavy tread up the stairs at a certain hour of the night, disappearing into a
  panel in the landing. The lady had the courage to lie in wait for him, and
  perceived him to be a small, aged man in a shabby tweed suit, carrying his
  boots in his hand. He emitted "a sort of yellow luminous light." This
  creature ascended at 1 a.m., and emerged again at 4.30, descending the stair
  with the same audible tread. The lady kept the matter to herself, but a nurse
  who was brought to tend one of the children came screaming in the middle of
  the night to say that there was "a dreadful old man" in the house. She had
  descended to the dining-room to get some water for her patient, and had seen
  him seated in a chair and taking off his boots. He was seen by his own light,
  for she had not had time to strike a match. The lady's brother and her
  husband both corroborated the phenomena, and the latter went very thoroughly
  into the matter. He found that under the house was a cellar which opened into
  a cave, up which the water came at full tide. It was an ideal situation for a
  smuggler. That night the husband and wife kept watch in the cellar, where
  they saw a very terrible spectacle. In a light resembling that of the moon
  they were aware of two elderly men engaged in a terrific struggle. One got
  the other down and killed him, bundling the body through the door into the
  cave beyond. He then buried the knife with which the deed was done, though
  curiously enough this detail was only observed by the husband, who actually
  unearthed a knife afterwards at the spot. Both witnesses then saw the
  murderer pass them, and they followed him into the dining-room, where he
  drank some brandy, though this action was seen by the wife and not the
  husband. He then took off his boots, exactly as the nurse had already
  described. With his boots in his hand he ascended the stairs and passed
  through the panel as he had done so often before, the inference being that on
  each previous occasion the scene in the cellar had preceded his advent.</p>

  <p>Inquiry now showed that many years ago the house had been inhabited by two
  brothers who amassed considerable wealth by smuggling. They had hoarded their
  money in partnership, but one of them finally announced his intention of
  getting married, which involved his drawing his share of the treasure. Soon
  afterwards this brother disappeared, and it was rumoured that he had gone to
  sea upon a long voyage. So far as I remember, for I write with only notes of
  the episode before me, the other brother went mad, and the affair was never
  cleared up in his lifetime. It should be added that the panel into which the
  vision disappeared concealed a large cupboard, which might well have been the
  treasure-house of the establishment. The graphic touch of the boots carried
  in the hand suggests that there was some housekeeper or other resident who
  might be disturbed by the sound of the murderer's footsteps.</p>

  <p>In this case one can certainly imagine that in so fratricidal a strife
  there would be a peculiar intensity of emotion on the part of both the
  actors, which would leave a marked record if anything could do so. That the
  record was indeed very marked is shown by the fact that the sight was not
  reserved for people with psychic qualities, like the first two instances here
  recorded, but that everyone, the husband, the wife, and the nurse all saw the
  apparition, which must therefore have been particularly solid even after the
  lapse of so many years. It might, I think, be put forward as a hypothesis
  supplementary to that of thought-forms thrown off in times of crisis, that
  the permanency and solidity of the form depend upon the extremity of the
  emotion.</p>

  <p>A second illustration may be drawn from Mrs. Tweedale's reminiscences. I
  am taking my cases from a limited number of books, for the sake of
  convenience in reference, but they are typical of very many others. The most
  absurd of the many absurd charges against Spiritualism is that it has no
  literature. It has actually a literature with which no other religion could
  attempt to compare, and it may safely be said that if an assiduous reader
  were to devour nothing else for fifty years he would be very far from having
  got to the end of it. Its quality is not on a par with its quantity, but even
  there I would undertake to name fifty books on the scientific and religious
  sides of Spiritualism which would outweigh in interest, dignity, and
  brain-power an equal list from any other philosophy. Yet the public is kept
  absolutely ignorant of the greater part of these remarkable works, many of
  which will one day be world-famous. The people who acted and wrote in the
  Apostolic epoch of the Christian Church little thought how their actions
  would appear two thousand years later, and certainly the supercilious
  philosophers and scandalized high priests would have been much astounded to
  know of the changed values which time has created.</p>

  <p>To return, however, to the further illustration, it concerns the doings in
  a shooting-lodge in Argyllshire, inhabited in 1901 by Major and Mrs. Stewart,
  the latter being the sister of Mrs. Tweedale. The starting-point of this
  haunting had been a situation which would form a grim theme for a novelist.
  An elderly farmer, who was a widower with a grown-up son, married a young
  girl. His son soon learned to love his stepmother, and the love may have been
  passionately returned. The result was a struggle in which the son was killed
  by the father. It is not to be wondered at that so horrible an event should
  leave a great psychic disturbance behind it, and the lodge was found to be a
  storm-centre of the unknown forces. The phenomena, which seem to have
  occurred every night, took the form of loud thuds and crashes, especially in
  a certain room upon the upper floor, which had probably been a bedroom.
  Footsteps resounded down the stairs, and upon one occasion the whole terrible
  fight was enacted in the passage, with all the blows and curses of the
  infuriated men. The tragedy may well have commenced upstairs, the guilty son
  have fled to the door, and been overtaken by his father in the hall below.
  The impressions seem to have been entirely auditory, though a clairvoyant
  would no doubt have seen the scene even as it occurred. This case closely
  resembles the last, in that the most furious human passions must have been
  aroused, so that every condition existed for a permanent psychic record. It
  should be added that in this latter instance four Pomeranian dogs in the
  house were reduced to abject terror, showing that there was no hallucination
  upon the part of the human observers.</p>

  <p>In discussing reasons for these and similar phenomena we must not make the
  mistake of supposing that one single explanation can cover all the range of
  the facts. To do so would be to court disaster, for someone could at once
  produce a case which could not be so covered. These instances which have been
  quoted have all sprung from scenes of emotion, and all represent, as I
  venture to suggest, mere shadow-forms detached from the real personality.
  There is another class of case, however, which produces much the same result,
  since haunting forms are seen, but which differs utterly: in its nature, in
  that the forms appear to be the actual materialized spirits of the dead held
  fast by their thoughts and desires to some spot which they have loved upon
  earth. Such a bondage would probably seem by no means unpleasant to them, and
  might only mean that in the interval of such duties as they might find
  awaiting them in a new life they loved to return to the old happy scene of
  their earth-memories. Thus, Brother John, in <i>The Gate of Remembrance</i>,
  was an entirely good and happy spirit, and no doubt had his duties elsewhere,
  yet his great love for Glastonbury Abbey brought him down whenever the
  interests of the old ruins demanded it. All accounts of the wandering of dead
  misers and others round the scene of their earthly ambitions would probably
  come in a lower and less happy degree under the same head. One excellent and
  typical example of what I mean was the case of the old Kent manor-house as
  detailed by Mr. Dale Owen.</p>

  <p>The narrative concerns Ramhurst Manor House, near Leigh, in Kent, and was
  compiled in 1857. The house was inhabited by the family of a British general,
  who were much disturbed by noises at night and other happenings. A
  clairvoyante young lady, who came as a visitor, was able to give them some
  information, her experience bearing out the rule already stated, that psychic
  hearing is easier and more common than psychic sight. She could see where the
  others could only hear. The ghosts who presented themselves were an elderly
  couple, dressed as in a bygone age, who actually stood upon the threshold to
  welcome her. After meeting them several times they spoke to her, and this
  marks a difference from all the shadow-forms already described, none of which
  show any sign of individual thought and speech. These old people explained
  that they had once lived in the Manor House, and that their name on earth was
  Children. They declared that they had idolized their property, that its
  improvement was the centre of their thoughts, and that they were now grieved
  to see that it had passed away to strangers. It was a case where total
  absorption in an earthly thing, however innocent, had become a fatal bar to
  spiritual advancement&mdash;a danger against which we must all earnestly
  guard. Their voices as they spoke seemed normal to the young lady, while the
  point lace upon the beautifully-brocaded dress was imprinted in her memory.
  The living lady of the house was able soon afterwards to confirm the
  statement of her clairvoyante friend, for she also saw the female vision with
  the name, "Dame Children," written above her in letters of phosphoric fire,
  together with a statement that she was "earth-bound." For some time diligent
  inquiry could not find any trace of a family of this unusual name having ever
  occupied the house, but finally a very old woman was found who in her youth
  had met an aged man who said that in his boyhood he had helped in the kennels
  of the Children family. Mr. Dale Owen was so interested in the case that he
  personally investigated it and cross- examined all the witnesses. On asking
  the young lady whether the ghost had said anything else of an evidential
  nature, she remembered that Richard was given as the name of the man, and
  that the date 1753 was associated with his death. Following up his
  researches, Mr. Dale Owen discovered some account of the Manor House, which
  concluded with the words: "Richard Children, Esqre., resided here and died
  possessed of it in 1753, aged eighty-three years. He was succeeded in it by
  ... George Children who is the present possessor."</p>

  <p>This narrative must carry conviction with it to any reasonable mind,
  though I must refer the reader to Dale Owen's <i>Footfalls</i> for the
  smaller details which mean so much. It suggests that the whole range of
  hauntings of this nature spring from undue preoccupation and want of
  spiritual effort. One such case seems to carry more warning than all the
  sermons that ever were spoken. At the same time, Providence is not cruel,
  and, as I have said, the bondage which is formed by earth-thoughts need not
  really be an unhappy one to those who are held by it.</p>

  <p>When separated into the mere shadows or thought-forms on one side, and
  actual earth-bound spirits on the other, it is not difficult to analyse and
  understand a large proportion of preternatural happenings. The division is
  admittedly a temporary hypothesis, but it serves to keep some sort of order
  in a subject which has until recently been a mad chaos of inexplicable
  effects without rational cause. Cases will still obtrude themselves, however,
  which disturb the tidiness of the most well-ordered theories, and I do not
  know a more baffling one than that which is treated by two English
  school-mistresses, and admirably described in their little book called <i>An
  Adventure</i>.</p>

  <p>This adventure, shortly told, consisted in the fact that during a visit to
  Paris they entered the gardens of Versailles in order to see the Grand
  Trianon, and that while in those gardens they had a most extraordinary
  experience, which in the case of one of the ladies was repeated with
  variations upon the occasion of a second visit. They suddenly appeared to be
  in the gardens as they were a century before, at the time of the French
  Revolution, and to see, and in some cases actually speak with, gardeners,
  messengers, and others who were there in the days of Marie Antoinette. So
  natural was it all, beginning and ending with normal life, that the ladies
  hardly understood what had happened to them until they began to compare
  notes, and realized that some of the buildings and garden arrangements which
  they had seen had not existed within the memory of man. Both ladies carried
  away a clear remembrance of dignified officials in grey-green coats and small
  three-cornered hats, of an intensely still landscape, of trees that looked
  like tapestry, of cloaked, large-hatted figures, of a running messenger who
  shouted instructions to them, of a long-waisted, full-skirted lady with a
  pale-green fichu, of a jaunty young footman, and other quite definite details
  &mdash;all this at four o'clock of a summer afternoon. A second visit by one
  lady alone, some four months later, produced similar effects, differing in
  detail but not in general character from the first.</p>

  <p>Such an experience is so very unlike the vast majority of psychic cases
  that one is inclined to push it aside. If one cannot get a document into a
  pigeon-hole, one is too ready with a waste-paper basket, and it is this human
  tendency which has retarded our advance in this new science. Anyone who
  carefully reads the narrative of these ladies, and notices the points of
  resemblance and also the very interesting points of divergence in their
  stories, cannot fail to take them seriously. It was not imagination or
  suggestion or, so far as one can judge, hallucination. But what it was, and
  why by some strange psychic refraction this mirage of the past should be
  thrown down upon the present, is an insoluble problem. It must at least teach
  us that, however much our tiny brains may endeavour to comprehend and
  classify these extraordinary phenomena, there still remain so many unknown
  causes and unexplained conditions that for many a long year to come our best
  efforts can only be regarded as well-meant approximations to the
  truth.</p><br>

     id="chap3">NOTES FROM A STRANGE MAIL BAG</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, June 1928<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">For many years I have been the recipient of as strange a
  shower of letters as one could imagine. They come from all sorts of folk who
  have had all sorts of psychic experiences. They demand sympathy, advice and
  explanation. The former I can give, but the latter are not always so easy.
  The handling of this correspondence has added a burden to my already
  over-weighted days, but it is not work which I can hand to a delegate, since
  very often fine points of knowledge are involved, and the letters are
  exceedingly confidential and personal. I am glad to think that I have left
  few unanswered, but it has been at the expense of much energy and time which
  might, perhaps, have been better employed in some more general fashion. And
  yet some good end might be attained if I could use them discreetly in order
  to ventilate in public the various matters discussed.</p>

  <p>If the reader likes to treat the cases as instances of delusion or of
  peculiar mental aberration that is for his own judgment to decide. I only put
  forward the letters as being very real facts to those who wrote them. The
  rest is a matter of individual opinion. From my cabinet of tabulated drawers
  I take down the one which is labelled "Dreams," and I pick a few of the
  contents almost at haphazard.</p>

  <p>Here is a very vivid letter from a lady who is herself a musical composer.
  She dreamed that she was in the presence of a great celestial choir. Her
  account is an arresting one, and none can doubt that some tremendous impact
  had been made upon her mind.</p>

  <p>"The orchestra was of vast size&mdash;something like the seating capacity
  of the Albert Hall. The conductor and the singers were on my right, but after
  they started playing I realized that they were all round me, and there was a
  great bank of strings on my left. They were playing what seemed like the end
  of a classical symphony and the speed they took it at far exceeded any tempo
  I've heard here. It was like a sea of bows flashing up and down. As I watched
  them a curious thing happened. It seemed as if the senses of sight and sound
  merged into one faculty, and that I could <i>see</i> the vibrations from
  those violins. You remember the spray mist which hangs over Niagara Falls.
  Just such a shimmering haze seemed to float above the players. The other
  thing that struck me was the ideal beauty of the ensemble. That mighty host
  of players were like one thought and action. It so far exceeded anything I
  have heard here as to be almost overpowering. My own sense of perfection
  could hardly stretch to it. It was marvellous. Of course, my thoughts are
  continually on music and rehearsals, so that itself would not convey much,
  but this idea of seeing sound vibrations had never entered my conscious
  thoughts, and that is the most vivid impression of the dream."</p>

  <p>Though the lady did not know it, the idea of the close connexion between
  colour and sound is one which has frequently come to us in what purported to
  be descriptions of life in the Beyond. I could very readily find a dozen
  illustrations of the fact among those posthumous accounts which profess to
  describe the experiences which await us. The general idea of concerted music
  is also very familiar. "I play in an orchestra and I enjoy it so much." Such
  was a message which I received myself recently from a friend who was fond of
  music. Lester Coltman the Guardsman, in what is asserted to be his
  after-death experience, says:</p>

  <p>"Orchestration is my great hobby here," and adds: "For some time after I
  passed over I was undecided as to whether music or science should be my work.
  After much serious thought, I determined that music should be my hobby and my
  more earnest intent should be directed upon science in every form."</p>

  <p>It may be said generally that the evidence of psychic research agrees with
  the vague Christian tradition that music plays a large part in the higher
  spheres.</p>

  <p>The next letter which I pick up deals with a very much less elevated
  impression. This is an American writing from San Jos&eacute;, California, who
  dreams names.</p>

  <p>"If I can identify the name with some race-horse, I have found that the
  horse has, nine times out of ten, won the race. I am not interested in horse-
  racing, and have not been on a track for twenty years."</p>

  <p>The next letter is also about horse-racing, from a retired Captain in
  Ireland. In his case he claims to get a picture, not a name. He is not a
  betting man and makes no use of his information, which is just as well for
  the bookies. Going over his results, I find that he seldom got a winner, but
  that his horses were invariably placed. It was a curious dumb-crambo system
  of conveying names, when supplied by vision, but occasionally they came in an
  audible voice at the moment of waking from sleep. What are we to make of such
  an experience? Is it imagination followed by coincidence? Or is it of some
  humble psychic origin? We have to place on the other side the many cases
  where such dreams have betrayed us. Only last year I had the experience of
  backing the dream of a friend for the Derby, and being five pounds poorer as
  a consequence.</p>

  <p>The next letter takes us back into the black days of the War. It is from
  an English lady living in Finland. Her younger brother was killed at the
  front in one of the final battles in a dawn attack. At that hour the lady
  went through his whole experience, visualized the battlefield, heard the
  guns, and saw an elderly and moustached German who threw something &mdash;
  presumably a bomb&mdash;which struck her down. Some nights later she had a
  second equally vivid dream in which a radiant spirit led her along a
  poplar-lined French road and halted at last at the spot where the dead body
  of her brother was lying. She declares that she had every reason at the time
  to think that her brother was at a depot and not in the firing-line. It was
  after the Armistice that official news was given of his death. This is one of
  a class of cases which has been so common that no reasonable man can deny
  them. To explain them is another matter, for even if one accepts the full
  faith of Spiritualism there is a good deal which is inexplicable.</p>

  <p>The next item is from the West of America. The writer has three times
  during ten years had an extraordinary and very vivid dream which has always
  been the same. He was in each case commanding the bodyguard of an Oriental
  Sultan and had to defend a palace attacked by rebels. On each occasion he was
  killed and found himself after death looking down upon a litter of dead
  bodies. The country in which these incidents occurred gradually revealed
  itself to him as being Oman upon the east coast of Arabia, and the dreamer
  actually opened a correspondence with the Sultan of Muscat, a letter from
  whom he enclosed to me as a proof of good faith. The Sultan took a lively
  interest in the matter and was anxious that the dreamer should visit him, but
  the coming of the War intervened. The American protests that he is still
  planning to go to Muscat, though one would have thought that it is the one
  place which he would have carefully avoided. No sequel has yet been reported,
  though the letter is two years old.</p>

  <p>I pick up a letter now which is of a most interesting type. It is from a
  lady in Chicago. She lay at the point of death with a temperature of 105 .
  She was insensible but dreaming vividly. She seemed to hear music of
  unearthly beauty, and to be surrounded by the faces of many loved ones who
  had passed on. The only sensation was one of delicious languor.</p>

  <p>"It was the most vivid and beautiful dream I ever experienced. When I came
  to myself I thought that if death was like that I should not mind going at
  any time. Is it then possible for the soul to leave the body for a short
  while and then to return again?"</p>

  <p>My answer was that I had numerous similar cases which seemed to show that
  it <i>was</i> possible, and that such knowledge did indeed remove all fear of
  death.</p>

  <p>The next letter is also from an American lady and is not very dissimilar
  in its subject. It was not the weakness of disease but it was the emotion
  produced by music which, in her case, seems to have effected a temporary
  dissociation between soul and body. The opera was "Manon Lescaut" and Caruso
  the singer.</p>

  <p>"At the grand climax," she writes, "I seemed to float away upward, quite
  overwhelmed. After the curtain fell I was still away. The live part of me had
  separated from my body and it was with the greatest difficulty that I forced
  myself together. With a look of consternation the lady next me observed my
  condition."</p>

  <p>Reduced to common speech all this simply means that the lady was on the
  point of fainting, and yet it may make us ask ourselves what we mean exactly
  when we use the phrase.</p>

  <p>The dream which duplicates an actual occurrence is hard to explain, but an
  even tougher problem is presented by the prophetic dream which gives a
  picture of the future. My next letter is from a man in Liverpool who found
  himself in his sleep standing by a railway station and looking up a sloping
  road with another road at right angles at the top. There was a bridge above
  him, and over the bridge came a tramcar on which was painted some strange
  place names of which he had never heard. Some months later he visited Wrexham
  for the first time and there he found the station, the road, the slope, the
  bridge and the tram, which had Welsh names on the outside. Nothing arose from
  the incident, and there seemed no possible reason why it should have been
  shot into the sleeper's mind months beforehand. In the case of this and
  similar incidents which are both trivial and psychic, one can only suppose
  that an attempt is made&mdash;we cannot say by whom&mdash;to awaken the
  interest of the recipient in spiritual matters by showing him things which
  are outside the ken of material science. It certainly has such an effect, for
  the man who has had such an experience is far more open afterwards to psychic
  knowledge. An alternative explanation would be that in one of those nocturnal
  rambles which our souls or etheric bodies do seem to take, the dreamer had
  visited Wrexham&mdash;possibly drawn by the fact that he had relatives living
  there&mdash;and that he chanced to carry back some memory of its appearance.
  The tram might well be running in the early morning.</p>

  <p>A second experience by the same gentleman rather supports the latter
  explanation. He dreamed that he saw a lady friend working at some pink
  material. On inquiry she said, "Yes, I stayed up late last night making a
  cr&ecirc;pe de Chine blouse of pink stuff, which I particularly wished to
  finish." Since she was late it is probable that his dream saw that which was
  actually occurring at the moment, and that it was an instance of what has
  been called "travelling clairvoyance" where the etheric body brings back
  information&mdash;surprisingly trivial information at times&mdash;to the
  unconscious material brain.</p>

  <p>The next item is less complex. It comes from Battersea. A Mrs. Arbuthnot
  dreamed that her life was threatened by a friend whom we will call Mrs.
  Burton. When she told the dream she was not aware that Mrs. Burton had at
  that time a maniacal attack in which she imagined she had some deadly
  grievance against her friend. This would appear to be a clear case of
  telepathy. I may add that telepathy, which is constantly given as an
  explanation of other psychic happenings, is, in my opinion, among the less
  common phenomena, and is by no means so clearly established as some of the
  physical manifestations.</p>

  <p>To return to prophetic dreams: they are occasionally of a very helpful
  character, as the next example will show. The writer is a Manchester man
  fresh from Cambridge. During a visit to Switzerland he dreamed that he was in
  a tropical land, sandy, with a shimmering heat and an intensely blue sky.
  Suddenly, a huge man appeared before him holding a triangular dagger of
  peculiar shape, with which he made the motion of striking. He then vanished.
  Next day the youth explored a disused tunnel.</p>

  <p>"I went in and found magnificent icicles hanging from the roof. All at
  once I saw one very large one. It was triangular and came to a sharp point. I
  thought of my dream, and recognized the triangular dagger. I stopped, and at
  that moment the whole thing fell with a crash. It must have weighed at least
  two hundred pounds and would perhaps have killed me."</p>

  <p>What are we to make of this? Is it not beyond coincidence? And how are we
  to explain the tropical scene? I would only suggest&mdash;but with all
  reserve&mdash;that many of us believe that we have guides or guardian angels.
  These guides would appear to be often drawn from the Oriental races.
  Supposing that this youth's guide was an Egyptian he might, in warning his
  pupil, have brought back with him some impression of his native land. The
  student remarked that the dagger was of a shape which was once used in
  Ancient Egypt. Such an explanation may stand until a better one is found.</p>

  <p>A number of these dreams are concerned with objects which have been lost
  and found again by revelation. There is always the consideration that such
  finds may have been the result of some subconscious train of thought, as
  occurs so often in our everyday experience, when the solution of some problem
  wells suddenly up from the unknown depths of our mentality. But in some cases
  this would seem to be impossible. Here, for example, is a letter from Bath.
  The writer was a solicitor in a South African city. He had a client to whose
  father in early days a grant of land had been made on the outskirts of the
  city. At the time it was of no value, but as the city spread it became so,
  but very many years had passed and the grant was lost. One night the client
  dreamed where it was. Next day, accompanied by a resident who knew the town
  well, he walked to the place of his dream, identified a certain cottage, had
  his knock answered by a lady whom he had seen in his sleep, walked through to
  an outhouse, opened an old box and plucked out the grant which had been
  stuffed into an envelope tacked to the inside of the lid. It is sad to relate
  that after all this trouble the grant was not admitted by the new generation
  of officials. But the story told as it is by the solicitor concerned, seems
  to be incontrovertible. What are we to make of it? Here, again, we seem to be
  balanced between the possibilities of the wandering soul and those of
  external intelligence. In any case, such incidents deserve our best
  consideration, and our men of Science may well turn their minds from the
  insects and the stones in order to unravel problems so intimately related to
  our own nature and fate.</p>

  <p>The next letter happens to be from the same quarter and on a similar
  subject. It tells the tale of a <i>Muizenberg</i> lady who lost her box and
  had successive dreams of it for several months during its various and devious
  wanderings, until she at last saw it in her sleep reposing upon the shelf of
  the lost property office, whence she duly reclaimed it next morning. When one
  reads such an account one feels a certain sense of injury as we survey our
  own losses, and we wonder why we also should not all have such help. Here we
  must admit that we are on the edge of the unknown. The wireless message comes
  sharp and clear when we tune in to the exact vibration. A fraction above or
  below and it is gone. Here, too, there may be unconscious tuning-in of the
  receiver. But what is the transmitter? That is the next great problem which
  faces humanity.</p>

  <p>It is clear that to find the right receiver is difficult, otherwise
  messages would not be sent in so indirect a fashion. The next example
  illustrates what I mean. A London lady gets a message, or rather a vision,
  which assures her that an unknown woman, who is embracing two children, is
  about to "go on her last journey&mdash;her last, long, strange journey." The
  actual message and the name, Mrs. Lorimer, came audibly. On inquiry the
  dreamer found that there was such a woman, that she had two children, and
  subsequently that she died. We may well deduce that if the receptive power
  were a common one the message would certainly have been given more directly
  and not in a way which was so distant that it might well have miscarried.</p>

  <p>I have spoken of the night travels of the etheric body. I come now to a
  very remarkable example of it&mdash;unique, so far as I know, because the
  return to the material body was slow and clearly remembered. The gentleman
  who writes to me&mdash;a Manchester man&mdash;fell asleep before his fire. He
  woke up still seated in a chair in the early morning and glanced at the
  clock. It marked 12.15 but&mdash;it was not <i>his</i> clock.</p>

  <p>With amazed eyes he looked along the mantelpiece. Everything was strange.
  There were two big bronzes of equestrian figures. The mantelpiece itself was
  of heavy red marble. The fire-irons were of massive brass. He was so
  petrified that it was a long time before he could bring himself to look
  round. When at last he cautiously turned his head he found himself in a very
  large room lined with books. There was a reading-lamp on a long central
  table, and a man was seated at it. My correspondent was filled with the idea
  that he had wandered into some stranger's house, so with an effort he rose
  and addressed the man at the table. Getting no answer he touched him. As the
  man took no notice and remained very still the writer was speculating whether
  he was dead, when he suddenly turned the page and went on reading. At this
  instant the walls of the room seemed to whirl round and my correspondent
  found himself in his own chair, facing his own clock, and with the time
  registered as 12.25. He winds up his narrative with the words, "I give you my
  most solemn word of honour that I have told you what I consider to be the
  truth."</p>

  <p>Accepting this final statement we have to find a rational explanation. The
  most rational surely is that the process of travelling clairvoyance and the
  return from the dream journey were done slowly and consciously, instead of
  coming in a flash. Had the latter been the case the dreamer would simply have
  had a vague recollection of some large room with books in it, and it would in
  no way have differed from a normal dream impression. But, for some reason,
  the process was carried out slowly and in stages. The etheric body came to
  conscious life&mdash;a life which could be registered on the material brain
  &mdash;while making itself very comfortable in front of the fire of what
  would appear to have been a Club library with one belated member therein. The
  insubstantial etheric body was unable to impress the material senses of the
  reader, but it is possible that if the latter had looked up from his book he
  might have had a wonderful ghost story to tell for the rest of his life. Then
  came the belated return, when, like a homing pigeon, the wandering soul
  shoots swiftly and unerringly back to its body. Should it lose its way, then
  one more mortal has died in his sleep.</p>

  <p>There is some evidence that it is more easy for these dream messages to be
  conveyed to us by pictures and symbols than by words, though sometimes the
  picture comes first and then the explanatory message. At the time, early in
  the War, when there was alarm about the fate of Maurice Hewlett's son, a lady
  in Scotland had a clear vision of a man being rescued from a seaplane, and an
  audible message came, "That is Maurice Hewlett's son. He is rescued." This
  was put on record at the time; a fact which I have tested, for I have before
  me a document.</p>

  <p>"We, the undersigned, declare that the account of this dream was given to
  us, as written, <i>before</i> the announcement of the rescue appeared."</p>

  <p>This is signed by two witnesses. One could hardly wish for a clearer case
  than this, but it may have been the travelling soul of the dreamer which
  carried back both the picture and the message. Again, I have an account from
  a French lady whose husband managed the household affairs in an
  unsatisfactory way. She saw her dead father, who handed her a large key. This
  key opened a door which led to a room which was exceedingly untidy, but
  became all right again when the lady entered. She took the dream to mean that
  she was to be mistress in her own house, and acted accordingly, with the best
  results. Here the appearance of the father certainly gives an other-world
  flavour to the transaction.</p>

  <p>Such dreams are useful, but occasionally I read of one which is so useless
  that one is hard put to it when one tries to weave it into any philosophy.
  Thus one correspondent dreamed that a child was born to him, which was so
  discoloured in the body that it would appear to have been scorched. A
  policeman was mixed up with the dream. Next morning a policeman entered his
  shop with a summons to a jury for an inquest. The case proved to be that of a
  poor tramp who had been badly scorched by his straw bed taking fire. Such an
  incident is not entirely beyond coincidence, and in no case does it seem to
  have served any purpose.</p>

  <p>Sometimes one can see no object in the communication, and yet the psychic
  evidence is very strong and is calculated to turn the mind of the recipient
  to spiritual interpretations of life. Thus in the case of a Mrs. Lofty, she
  writes to say that she lost her son, Grantham Lofty, in a flying mishap.</p>

  <p>"One day I felt like ending everything, when it was suggested to me in the
  most clear way that I should think of my dream."</p>

  <p>It seems that two years before the lady and a friend had both dreamed the
  same dream on the same night. The dream included a message that James Lofty
  was dying or dead in No. 7 Ward.</p>

  <p>"I wrote out the dream at once and sent it to my sister."</p>

  <p>Immediately after the tragedy occurred, two years after the dream, the
  lady visited Haslar Hospital, and found that the ward in which her son died
  was No. 7, and that by some error his name on the hospital books had been
  entered as James. This certainly is a complex and remarkable case, but it
  seems to have assured the mother of his continued existence and consoled her
  in the hour of need.</p>

  <p>One very common dream impression which may well be connected with those
  soul wanderings which come, in my opinion, well within the category of things
  proven, is the feeling of flying. It often occurs to dreamers, but more to
  some than to others in proportion as their switch-off is absolute or partial.
  Thus a dreamer writes from South Carolina.</p>

  <p>"One dream comes to me over and over again. At least one thousand times I
  have dreamed that I was exercising a power of transporting my body through
  the air in defiance of gravitation. Usually I just lift my feet from the
  ground and will myself to float in the desired direction without any physical
  effort. At other times, when I wish to reach a higher level, I work my arms
  as if they were wings. I seem in my dreams to call the attention of ordinary
  mortals to what I am doing, but if they possess the power to see it they
  never make any comment on it."</p>

  <p>They would, of course, no more see it than the man in the Club library saw
  the etheric body which touched him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>Several of these letters&mdash;and perhaps the most important &mdash;
  allude to the perceptions which the dreamers carry back of some wonderful
  land which some of us think is actually the etheric world, suited for etheric
  life, and which others may try to explain as a glimpse of our own tropics, or
  as some imaginative scene which has no actual existence. It is as real to the
  dreamer, as was that clock in the Club library upon which the sleeper read
  the time, and equally real seem those figures with whom they hold
  converse.</p>

  <p>Here is the sort of thing from a correspondent:</p>

  <p>"I have twice in sleep crossed over into the spirit world. The radiance
  and wonderful beauty of the country was what struck me more than anything. I
  felt, above all, that this was a land of extraordinary happiness. On the
  first occasion I met and spoke with my brother. On the second I saw no one,
  but was deeply impressed by the beauty of the lake and hills among which I
  found myself. The colours were indeed different from those on earth. They had
  an exceeding glory."</p>

  <p>This matches very closely a large number of other descriptions. I am aware
  of all the difficulties connected with such a view of the Beyond. We are
  faced with the obvious reflection that hills and valleys are the result of
  geological action, of rain and age-long denudation, so that their existence,
  from our point of view, would seem to imply similar actions in their
  formation. It is a legitimate and cogent objection. And yet, the positive
  agreement of a great number of witnesses cannot be easily set aside. Some
  have thought that this old earth may have its own etheric body, even as its
  inhabitants have. Certainly, if we are to cut out all effects of earthly
  elemental action, heaven would become a flat and waterless expanse, which
  would seem more logical than attractive.</p>

  <p>In discussing dream appearances of the other spheres, I may perhaps be
  permitted to give an experience of my own&mdash;though I may quote with all
  reverence, "Whether in the body or out of it, I know not." I had been told at
  a s&eacute;ance that I should visit in my sleep some other sphere, upon which
  I earnestly begged that I might carry back the memory. There followed an
  eventful night, some of which is quite as clear to me as any adventure I have
  had upon the earth's surface.</p>

  <p>My first impression was that of a row of rather dilapidated stone villas,
  such as one would see in the suburbs of Edinburgh. They looked well in front
  but were only half-finished within, though I observed pictures upon the walls
  &mdash;frescoes rather, since they seemed to be part of the wall. There was
  waste ground around, untidy and weed-covered. I saw no dwellers in these
  uncomfortable buildings, but I was aware all through that I had a companion
  at my side, whose face I never saw. This invisibility did not seem to worry
  me at the time, and I made no attempt to get past it.</p>

  <p>Then, with no consciousness of an intervening journey, I was in another
  place. It was a large hall or assembly place. Once again there were coloured
  frescoes on the wall, but I carried away no impression of the subjects. There
  were pillars and an ornamental ceiling. Close to me was standing a man
  dressed in Elizabethan dress. He had a plum-coloured doublet and trunk hose.
  We eyed each other and I was so completely myself that I smiled and said,
  "Well, if you fellows are going to dress like that we poor moderns have no
  chance." He made no answer, and his face was quite unresponsive. I could
  recognize the man now if I saw him, ruddy-faced, about thirty-five years of
  age, short, crisp, black hair and a black moustache, well-built and vigorous.
  He was sullen and sinister in his expression. I was conscious of someone else
  approaching with a black Spanish cloak. Then it all disappeared.</p>

  <p>I was now in a vehicle of some sort&mdash;I have no impression of a horse,
  but I was more conscious than before of my companion. There was a vague
  feeling of hurry&mdash;we had to be at a certain place by a certain time. The
  road was broad and curving, with a hill-side upon the left with some ancient
  ruins built right into it. At the top of the hill we stopped. A wonderful
  panorama of a city lay before me. It was built upon low hills and it
  undulated away to the horizon. The sky and atmosphere were grey, but not more
  so than London on a winter day. I have never seen so great a city. High
  buildings and towers stretched as far as I could see, but I saw no spires.
  Then all faded away, and I awoke.</p>

  <p>It was a very intense experience and I give the explanation which I
  received next day from psychic sources for what the reader may think it is
  worth. It came in reply to questions.</p>

  <p>"It was a probationary city. Those pictures were instructive to people in
  that stage. You did not see your guide because it would have taken from the
  power. The power was running low, so we had to hurry in the end. You were
  taken to a grey city because that side of spirit life has always excited your
  sympathy and curiosity."</p>

  <p>Such was my most vivid nocturnal experience.</p>

  <p>Dreaming true is the only psychic power which I have hitherto developed
  outside healing. Before we went to Australia I got the name "Naldern"
  imprinted on my mind in sleep and wrote it down on waking. We sailed in the
  "Naldera," though we had intended another ship and had never consciously
  heard of the former. Again, I have put it on record before the event how I
  dreamed that the Piave would be the turning-point of the War, many months
  before the Italians were driven back sixty miles to that position, where they
  won their decisive victory. In literature I have had little help from dreams.
  Once I woke with a line ringing in my head. It was, "She walked alone on the
  Hills of Fate." I wrote a poem called "Victrix" round it, and it marks my
  highest point, perhaps, on the foothills of Parnassus.</p>

  <p>I may conclude these notes by stating my opinion as to the exact nature of
  dreams, as I have already done in my <i>New Revelation</i>. There seem to me
  to be two forms, and only two: one, the experiences of the released spirit,
  and the other, the confused action of the lower faculties which remain in the
  body when the spirit is absent. The former is rare and beautiful, but the
  memory of it fails us. The latter is common and varied, but usually fantastic
  or ignoble. By noting what is absent in the lower dreams one can tell what
  the missing qualities are, and so judge what part of us goes to make up the
  spirit. Thus in these dreams humour is wanting, since we see things which
  strike us afterwards as ludicrous, and are not amused. The sense of
  proportion and of judgment are all gone. In short, the higher is palpably
  gone, and the lower, the sense of fear, of sensual impression, of
  self-preservation, are functioning all the more vividly because they are
  relieved from the higher control.</p><br>

  <p class="first">If anyone craves for adventure, he will find it in psychic
  work. I have myself encountered many incidents in actual fact which I could
  hardly beat if I gave free play to my imagination.</p>

  <p>Some mention of Dr. and Mrs. Wickland of Los Angeles have occasionally
  found their way into the Press. He is a deep student of psychic phenomena
  believing, as I do myself, that a great deal of mania and crime is due to
  direct obsession, and that a recognition of the fact would be the first
  necessary step for dealing with it.</p>

  <p>She is a medium who is very sensitive to spirit presences, and is ready,
  with great bravery, to allow them to control her so long as she thinks a good
  purpose can be served. She is, in my opinion, one of the heroines of the
  world. Such were the couple, gentle, elderly folk, who drove out with us to
  see something of rural Sussex.</p>

  <p>I took them to the old moated grange of Groombridge, which is mentioned by
  Evelyn in his Diary. As we stood looking at the lichened brick walls, a door
  which gave upon the deep moat opened and a woman looked out. Then it closed
  again. We passed on, and I thought no more of the matter.</p>

  <p>As we walked through the meadow which led to the high road Mrs. Wickland
  kept glancing back. Presently she said:</p>

  <p>"There is such a strange old man walking beside us."</p>

  <p>"What is he like?"</p>

  <p>"He is old. His face is sunk forward. His back is hunched. He is earth-
  bound."</p>

  <p>"How is he dressed?"</p>

  <p>"He has knee-breeches, a striped vest, and quite a short coat."</p>

  <p>"Whence did he come?"</p>

  <p>"He came through that door that opened."</p>

  <p>"Then how did he cross the moat?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, and I don't know what he wants, but he is at our
  heels."</p>

  <p>I took my guests to the old Crown Inn in the village, where we had tea.
  Mrs. Wickland kept glancing at a chair in the corner beside her.</p>

  <p>"He is there." Presently she began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"I did not in the least want that second cup of tea, and the extra slice,"
  she said, "but he was close to me, and would have taken possession and helped
  himself if I had not done so."</p>

  <p>We had driven home, and were seated among the roses on my veranda, the
  Wicklands, my wife, and myself. We were talking of other things when the Seer
  suddenly gave a start.</p>

  <p>"He's here."</p>

  <p>Then came the amazing moment. Before our eyes she changed in an instant
  into a heavy-faced, sullen old man, with bent back and loose, senile lips.
  The whole expression was utterly different. She choked and spluttered in an
  effort to express the thoughts of the control.</p>

  <p>Dr. Wickland, with the quiet assurance of long practice, massaged the
  throat.</p>

  <p>"All right, friend, give yourself time."</p>

  <p>The new-comer shook off his hand angrily.</p>

  <p>"Leave me alone. What do you want to touch me for?" he croaked.</p>

  <p>From that time the dialogue was as follows, sometimes one and sometimes
  another asking the questions, and with ocasional gaspings and chokings as
  interruption.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am from Groombridge. My name? Well, I don't feel clear in my mind. Yes,
  yes, I remember. It is David. And Fletcher. That is it, David Fletcher. Yes,
  I have been in service there. Horses. Yes, it was the horses I looked to.
  What year is it? I don't know. My mind ain't clear. Is it 1808 or is it 1809?
  What d'ye say, 1927? Well, well, that's a good 'un."</p>

  <p>"Dead, why, I am here talkin' to you. How can I be dead? I'd be with God
  if I was dead." (Suddenly started.) "Look at my hand? Why there are rings on
  it. They look like my lady's rings. No, I don't know how they came to be
  there."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand a lot of things. I don't know who them folk are in the
  house. They have no call to be there. Me and the others try to put them out."
  ("The others," Dr. Wickland explained, "were probably other earth-bound
  spirits in the old house.")</p>

  <p>"Yes, master was a good master, but he died, and the others came in. The
  house was sold. We wasn't well treated after that. What could I do? No, I
  couldn't go away. Where was I to go out in the wide world, and me with a hump
  on my back? I belonged to the house. I had to do the best I could."</p>

  <p>"What have I done? I don't rightly understand it. I've slept always in the
  same old corner. It seems a long, long time."</p>

  <p>"Now tell us, David, don't you remember being very ill?"</p>

  <p>"Me ill? No, I was never ill. But I'll tell you what happened. He pushed
  me into the water."</p>

  <p>"Into the moat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, into the water."</p>

  <p>"Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"It was Sam." (Many chuckles.) "But I held on to him, I did. He came in
  the water, too." (Dr. Wickland remarked that the man was probably drowned on
  that occasion.)</p>

  <p>"Is there no one who loved you among the dead? Was your mother dead?"</p>

  <p>"Mother was dead. No one ever loved me, except mother. She loved me,
  mother did. No one could love me, because I looked queer. They laughed." (He
  burst into noisy sobbing.) "Mother loved me. Nobody else. They said it wasn't
  right that I wait upon the ladies, and me with a hump."</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, David; we will soon get the hump off you. How came you to
  follow us?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I think I was told. Then I got bread and tea. I have not
  had tea since I can remember. I would like more. I am always hungry. But what
  was that wagon? That was the devil's wagon, I think. I got in, but it went
  that fast that I was afeared to get out again." (This was my motor.)</p>

  <p>"It's as well for you that you did not, for we are going to do you good,
  David. First of all you have got to realize that you are dead. You were
  drowned that time you fell into the moat."</p>

  <p>"Well I never. That's a queer idea."</p>

  <p>"Now understand this." (It is Dr. Wickland, who is talking in cool,
  gentle, assured tones.) "You can do anything now by the power of thought, if
  you know how to use it. This hump of yours. Take it off. Take it off, I say.
  Your back is as straight as mine." (The bent figure began to straighten up
  and to sit erect in the chair. Suddenly both hands were thrown forward.)</p>

  <p>"Mother, mother." (His face had become younger, more intelligent and was
  shining with ecstacy.) "I see her and it's mother, but she looks younger than
  I can remember."</p>

  <p>"She will take charge of you now. You have been brought here by higher
  powers for a purpose&mdash;to save you. Do you want to go back to the old
  house?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, I want to go to mother. Oh you good kind people"&mdash;the rest
  was just incoherent gratitude.</p>

  <p>And so it was that the earth-bound ostler found his mother at last among
  the rambler roses of my balcony. Have I not said truly that the actual
  experiences of the Spiritualist, of which this is one in a hundred, are
  stranger far than what I should dare to invent?</p>

  <p>Is it all a fairy-tale? How about the change in the medium? How about the
  ostler's dress so accurately described? How about the cases where the actual
  names and addresses have been verified by the Wicklands?</p>

  <p>It is not a fairy-tale, but it is a new realm of knowledge which the human
  race has now to explore and to conquer.</p><br>

     id="chap5">THE LAW OF THE GHOST</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, December 1919<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">It is safe to say that for some centuries to come the human
  race will be very actively engaged in defining the laws which regulate
  psychic affairs, and it is fortunately a line of study which has the peculiar
  advantage to those who indulge in it that they can pursue it just as well,
  and probably better, from the other side of the veil. At present there is
  work lying to hand for a hundred investigators. The innumerable records which
  exist in various forms, and which are scattered throughout papers, magazines,
  reports of learned societies, family traditions, etc., are like masses of ore
  which have been extracted from the ground but are still lying in dumps
  waiting to be separated into precious ingots on the one side and slag-heap on
  the other. They have to be examined, collected into classes, reviewed in the
  light of our ever- increasing psychic knowledge, and an endeavour made to
  find underlying principles running through this vague collection of matter,
  so that at last we may touch solid ground by getting hold of some elementary
  laws. The first thing is that we should have authentic cases so that the
  foundation of our reasoning may be sound. The second is to compare these
  authentic cases together and see what common characteristics they possess,
  shirking nothing and following the facts wherever they lead without any
  preliminary prejudice. This is, of course, the true scientific fashion, but
  it is unfortunately one which has been neglected by most scientific men in
  approaching this new subject which would not fit in with their preconceived
  ideas. Let us hunt among these fascinating problems for shards and splinters
  out of which a noble mosaic will one day be constructed, and let us see
  whether here and there we may not find two or three pieces which fit
  together, and give some idea of a permanent pattern, even though it be a
  fantastic one. I will begin by telling three stories which seem to be
  absolutely authentic, and then we shall endeavour to trace some underlying
  connection.</p>

  <p>For full particulars of the first case the reader is referred to <i>West
  Indian Tales</i>, by Algernon Aspinall, with the explanation that the word
  "Tales" is not used in the sense of inventions, and that the facts are
  authentic, as is proved by numerous references in the narrative. These facts
  relate to the singular series of events which happened in connection with the
  vault at Christ-church, near the village of Oistin, on the south coast of
  Barbados. In the old slave days when rum and sugar were the foundations of
  many a goodly fortune, things were done on a large scale in the West Indies,
  and this burial vault was a very fine one. It was made of great blocks of
  coral and cement, partly sunk into the earth, for the graveyard was on an
  exposed hill, and terrific storms sweep over these latitudes. The entrance
  was covered by a huge slab of marble. Within, the dimensions of the vault
  were twelve feet by six and a half. So Cyclopean was the masonry and so
  remote the site that one would imagine an inmate was almost as secure as a
  king of Egypt in the heart of his pyramid. A contractor and a gang of skilled
  workmen would be needed to effect an entrance into so solid a construction.
  Little did those who erected it imagine that the whole island would be
  convulsed by the repeated proofs of its insecurity.</p>

  <p>In July, 1807, a Mrs. Goddard was buried therein, and her coffin was found
  undisturbed in February, 1808, when a child named Mary Chase was laid in a
  leaden casket beside her. For four years the vault was closed, but in July,
  1812, it was opened to admit a Miss Dorcas Chase. The horrified workmen found
  the coffin of the infant standing on its head in a corner. It was supposed
  that some mischievous and sacrilegious wretch had been guilty of a senseless
  outrage, so after the coffin was rearranged the great marble slab was once
  again placed in position, to be opened next month when a Mr. Chase joined the
  family group within. During the month there seems to have been no
  disturbance.</p>

  <p>In September, 1816, four years having again elapsed, the vault was opened
  once more to admit an infant, Samuel Arnes Once again all was in horrible
  confusion, and the coffins littered across one another. The affair was now
  becoming a scandal and the talk of the whole settlement, the whites putting
  it down to vandalism and the negroes to ghosts. Once again the vault was
  closed, and once again, two months later, it was opened to admit Samuel
  Brewster. Crowds followed the coffin and gathered round the vault when the
  great slab was pushed aside. In the short interval everything had again been
  disarranged, the coffins being abominably mishandled. Mrs. Goddard's coffin,
  which seems to have been of wood, was broken, but this may have been natural
  decay. The leaden coffins were scattered at all angles. Once again they were
  reverently collected, the wooden coffin was tied up, and the vault
  secured.</p>

  <p>Three years later, on July 7th, 1819, Miss Clarke was to be buried in the
  vault. So great was the public excitement that the governor, Lord Combermere,
  of Peninsula fame, attended the ceremony with his staff and aides-de-camp.
  Things were as bad as ever. The wooden coffin was intact, but the others were
  scattered in all directions. Lord Combermere was so interested that he had
  the whole structure searched and sounded, but there was no hidden approach or
  underground passage. It was an insoluble mystery. The coffins were rearranged
  and the floor carefully sanded so that footsteps would be revealed. The door
  was cemented up, which seems to have been done on each occasion, but this
  time the Governor affixed his own particular seal. The British Government had
  officially entered the lists against the powers of darkness.</p>

  <p>It is humiliating to add that the powers of darkness seemed not in the
  least abashed either by the Governor or by the Empire which he represented.
  Next year, in April 1820, it was determined that an official inspection
  should be made without waiting for a fresh interment. Lord Combermere with a
  formidable official party and a strong ally in the Rev. T. Orderson, rector
  of the parish, repaired to the vault, where the seals were found intact and
  all in apparent order.</p>

  <p>The cement was then broken and the slab removed by the exertions of ten
  negroes, who had the utmost difficulty in forcing an entrance. On exposing
  the interior it was found to the horror and amazement of the party that the
  difficulty in opening the vault had been caused by the fact that a leaden
  coffin within, so heavy that several men could hardly move it, had been
  jammed upside down against the slab. There was great confusion within but no
  marks upon the sand which covered the floor. So horrified was everyone by
  this final test that the bodies were now removed, and buried elsewhere. The
  empty vault remains, and is likely for many centuries to remain, as a refuge
  for snakes or centipedes, upon the lonely headland which overlooks the
  Atlantic.</p>

  <p>What is one to make of such a story as that? The facts seem to be beyond
  question. Are there any points which are particularly to be noted from a
  psychic point of view, in the hope that the germs of law may lie within? One
  is that the antipathy of those unseen forces was aroused apparently by the
  <i>leaden</i> coffins. When the wooden coffin was alone it was not molested.
  Its decay seems to have been natural, and when it was tied up it was not
  again disturbed. If it ever received any injury it may well have been from
  the weight of the ponderous leaden coffins which were dashed about around it.
  That is one possible point. A second and more important one is that all
  psychic phenomena seem to show that the disembodied have no power of their
  own, but that it is always derived from the emanations of the living, which
  we call animal magnetism or other names. Now this vault with its absolutely
  air-tight walls was particularly adapted for holding in such
  forces&mdash;being an exaggerated form of that cabinet which is used for that
  very purpose by a genuine medium. If the walls of cloth of a cabinet can
  contain these emanations and condense them, how much more the solid walls of
  this vault. To bring in these weighty leaden coffins the space must have been
  crowded with over-heated negroes, and when the slab was at once hermetically
  sealed, these effluvia were enclosed and remained behind, furnishing a
  possible source of that material power which is needful for material effects.
  These are two points worth noting before we pass on to see if any other such
  cases may fall into line with this one.</p>

  <p>We have not far to seek, for one is quoted in the very book under
  discussion, with a reference to the <i>European Magazine</i> for September,
  1815, under the heading "The Curious vault at Stanton in Suffolk." In the
  magazine account it says:</p>

  <p>On opening the vault some years since, several leaden coffins with wooden
  cases that had been fixed on biers, were found displaced to the great
  astonishment of many. The coffins were placed as before, when some time ago,
  another of the family dying, they were a second time found displaced. Two
  years after they were found not only all off the biers, but one coffin as
  heavy as to require eight men to raise it was found on the fourth step that
  leads into the vault.</p>

  <p>There unhappily the information ends. It tallies very closely with the
  West Indian case so far as it goes, but is far weaker as regards the evidence
  and the details. I have made inquiry from the present vicar of the parish but
  have been unable to improve either the one or the other. The statement that
  the phenomenon occurred twice and the precise information as to the situation
  of the coffin upon the fourth step of the stairs, seem to remove the story
  from vague rumour and to show that it was based upon some actual fact.</p>

  <p>The next case, however, is fuller and more circumstantial. It comes from
  the Livonian village of Ahrensburg in the Baltic, and remote as the scene is,
  the evidence is well attested.</p>

  <p>There is a considerable cemetery in the village, which is dotted with
  small private chapels, each of them with a family burial vault beneath it.
  The finest of these belonged to a family named Buxhoewden which faced the
  public high road, and contained certain posts to which the horses of the
  farmers used to be haltered when the owners were occupied in the town. The
  first signs of anything peculiar lay in the behaviour of these creatures,
  which showed such symptoms of terror that they attracted the notice of
  passers-by. They were covered with sweat, trembled all over, and in three
  cases actually died from the violence of their emotion. At the same time
  certain loud but vague sounds were heard to come either from the chapel or
  from the vault beneath it. These portents were in the early summer of the
  year 1844.</p>

  <p>In July a member of the Buxhoewden family died, and the hearse horses on
  approaching the cemetery showed the same signs of terror as the others. The
  service in the chapel was interrupted by hollow groans, which may have been
  imagined by a congregation who were already predisposed to alarm. What was
  not imagination, however, was the fact that those who afterwards descended
  into the vault found the coffins there, which had been in rows, cast into a
  confused heap upon the wooden floor. These coffins seem to have been of
  massive oak, very strongly and heavily made. This might have been the work of
  some enemy to the family, but the doors of the vault had been secured and the
  locks were intact. There was always the possibility of false keys, however,
  so the coffins were replaced in their order, and the place very carefully
  secured.</p>

  <p>As the agitation of the horses and the general unrest of the community
  still continued the chief man of the district, Baron de Guldenstubbe, took up
  the matter officially, and so the Russian Government found itself involved in
  the same one-sided contention from which the Governor of Barbados had gained
  so little satisfaction. With two of his family he made a preliminary
  examination, and then finding the coffins once again in confusion, he formed
  a committee of investigation consisting of himself, the local bishop, the
  Burgermeister, a physician named Luce and four representative citizens.</p>

  <p>On entering the vault they again found that the enemy had been at work and
  that the contents were scattered in all directions. Only three coffins, those
  of a very saintly grandmother and of two little children, were undisturbed.
  Attempted robbery was suggested as an explanation, which was the more
  plausible as an adjoining vault had once been entered, and some gold fringe
  taken from the coffins. But nothing was now missing nor was there any means
  of entrance. The committee pursued its research with great care, even to the
  point of opening some coffins to see if rings and trinkets buried with the
  owners were still within. It was found that this was so. Workmen were then
  called in to examine the floor and walls, but no secret entrance could be
  discovered.</p>

  <p>Everything was now closed up once more and the disconsolate committee
  withdrew, after placing heavy seals upon the door. Before leaving the vault
  fine ashes were scattered all over the wooden floor, and also over the steps
  leading down, and the pavement of the chapel. Finally guards were set for
  three days and nights. It must be admitted that they did things thoroughly in
  the village of Ahrensburg. At the end of that time the Commission returned in
  full state with the whole population lining the churchyard rails, eager to
  hear the result.</p>

  <p>The seals were unbroken, the door unopened, but the interior of the vault
  was in the usual state of chaos. No sign at any point was found upon the
  ashes and no human feet had entered, but great forces had none the less been
  at work. The secret powers, reinforced rather than abashed by the recent
  visit of the Commission, had wrought far greater mischief than before. All
  the coffins were scattered, save the same three which had been exempt before.
  Some of the heaviest had been placed upside-down so that the corpse was on
  its head, and in one instance the lid had burst and the right arm of the
  inmate, who was a man who had died by his own hand, was protruding and
  pointing towards the ceiling. Such was the fearsome spectacle which greeted
  the Commission. They were duly noted in a detailed report and are still to be
  consulted among the official records of the Island of Oesel, with the names
  of the witnesses attached. It is also on record that the effect upon the mind
  of Dr. Luce, who was a man of considerable attainments and a Voltairian in
  religion, was a complete change of mental outlook, and that revulsion from
  materialism which any actual contact with the spiritual world, even in its
  crudest forms, must logically produce.</p>

  <p>The result of these gruesome phenomena was that the coffins were removed
  from the vault and were buried in earth, after which complete tranquillity
  seems to have descended upon the little village. Not only were there no
  disturbances to vex the population, but the horses were observed to occupy
  their old stance without any symptoms of terror. Nothing was left of the
  whole incident save a memory, but it was a memory which should not be allowed
  to die, for the facts are really as well attested as facts could be. Apart
  from the official record, Mr. Dale Owen, who was American minister to Naples
  and a man of great intelligence, met Miss de Guldenstubbe and her brother in
  1859 and took their personal recollections of the whole matter. It is from
  his work that I have taken the details.</p>

  <p>No doubt many other such cases could be recorded, but here at least are
  three which appear to be authentic and which reproduce the same
  characteristics. If relics of some strange animal were found in three
  different localities, the first conclusion among men of science would be that
  such an animal did exist, and was henceforth to be included among the
  creatures of earth. The next proceeding would be to compare the relics and to
  endeavour to reconstruct some image of the new-comer. In the same way these
  three cases may be said to fairly establish the fact of these curious
  phenomena which involve the desecration of graves&mdash;a fact which, however
  gruesome, does at least strike at the very roots of that material view of
  life which has been so fashionable. When we come to compare the cases,
  however, and to deduce the underlying laws, the psychic student can at best
  only point to a few possible indications which may be of value.</p>

  <p>It has already been stated that one or more living people in a confined
  space which is afterwards closed up may leave behind them something human and
  yet invisible, which is sufficiently subtle to be used by forces from the
  other side as a basis for material phenomena. All movements of solid objects,
  touched or untouched, in the presence of a medium are to be explained in this
  fashion, and the force may be expected to be stronger when confined within a
  limited space. In the case of the Cheriton dug-out, which occupied public
  attention a couple of years ago, the worker and the boy were busy in a narrow
  excavation. One or other was mediumistic&mdash;that is to say, emitted to an
  unusual extent this emanation&mdash;with the result that the phenomena
  occurred in the same way, though with less force, when both of them had left
  the work for their luncheon, as Mr. Jaques, the owner of the property, was
  able to testify. Let us suppose that in the case of each of these three
  vaults there was an accumulation of this mysterious, but very certain, power
  left behind by the coffin-bearers, and possibly reinforced by the committees
  of inquiry, who would have been very amazed had they been told that they
  were, in all probability, themselves contributing to the phenomena. There, I
  think, you have the physical basis which is necessary for every spiritual
  manifestation, for it cannot too often or too clearly be insisted upon that
  spirits are not omnipotent and irresponsible forces, but that they are under
  a rule of law no less strict than our own. One of these laws is that a
  physical basis is needed for every physical manifestation. We may find in the
  future some non-human basis, for it is conceivable that some subtle chemical
  action could be established which would generate this magnetic force just as
  zinc and acid generate the kindred mystery of electricity. But a physical
  basis there must be. No ghost was ever self-supporting. He can exist without
  our help, but he cannot manifest to human eyes without drawing his material
  from human (or possibly animal) sources. That, as it seems, to me, is one of
  the basic laws of the new world of science.</p>

  <p>There is some evidence, which could be cited in full if it did not lead us
  down a lengthy side street, that when a life has been cut short before it has
  reached its God-appointed term, whether the cause be murder or suicide (of
  accident I speak with less confidence), there remains a store of unused
  vitality which may, where the circumstances are favourable, work itself off
  in capricious and irregular ways. This is, I admit, a provisional theory, but
  it has been forced upon my mind by many considerations. Such a theory would
  go some way to explain, or at least to throw some dim light upon, the
  disturbances which from all past time have been associated with scenes of
  violence and murder. If it could be conceived that the unseen part of a man
  is divisible into the higher, which passes on as spirit, and the lower which
  represents animal functions and mere unused vitality, then it is this latter
  which has not been normally worked off in a life prematurely ended, and which
  may express itself in strange semi-intelligent fashion afterwards. In dreams
  one is conscious of some such division, where the higher functions
  occasionally bring us back touches of the most spiritual; while the lower
  functions, deprived for the time of judgment, humour and all the spirit
  qualities, evolve a capricious and grotesque life of their own, which has
  neither reason nor sense of proportion and yet seems very real to us in our
  slumbers. It is not a subject upon which one could be dogmatic, but the days
  are passing when all such cases can be disposed of by being brushed aside and
  ignored as senseless superstition. Some sort of framework must be formed into
  which they can be fitted, and with fuller knowledge the fit will be
  closer.</p>

  <p>Finally the question arises: What was the object of such phenomena? We see
  that the result in at least two cases out of three was that the dead were
  buried elsewhere. Apparently for some reason the earth burial may have been
  desired instead of the seclusion of the vault. It would certainly hasten the
  absolute decomposition of the body, if that should be good from the point of
  view of the other world. This seems a farfetched supposition and one very
  much at variance with the belief of those numerous nations who have practised
  the art of embalming and corpse-preservation, but if this was not the object
  of the disturbance it must be admitted that it is difficult to see what other
  result was attained, save a very compelling proof of unseen intelligences and
  powers. If a speedy decomposition was the object aimed at, then the leaden
  and heavy oak coffins would check the process, which would be swifter in the
  more fragile wooden ones. This might conceivably explain the particular
  violence which seems to have been used towards the more permanent materials.
  Perhaps, however, we lose time in searching for rational explanations, since
  there is ample evidence that there can be rowdiness and hooliganism beyond
  the veil as well as here.</p>

  <p>One remark should be made before passing on to another form of ghostly
  manifestation. It has been said that the basis for physical results lies in
  the human organism. It is not meant, however, that there is any relation
  between the small amount often taken from the medium and the great physical
  results obtained. It is clear that the unseen forces can get great power from
  a limited supply of this subtle material. In the case carefully observed and
  noted by Professor Z&ouml;llner of Leipzig, a beam of wood which two horses
  could not have dragged apart was shattered into pieces in the presence of
  Slade. A friend of mine who was present at a meeting of the Goligher circle
  saw a table ascend in the air and remain there, although four strong men did
  all they could to drag it down. It is true that in a sitting of this sort the
  medium, Miss Goligher, frequently registered a loss of weight amounting to a
  stone in a s&eacute;ance upon the weighing-dial which Dr. Crawford had
  erected, but it is clear that the force exerted by the unseen powers was very
  much greater than this and was due to their own manipulation of the material
  which her organism had provided. In some of the sittings of D.D. Home, the
  force was so great that the whole building used to shake as if a heavy train
  were passing below it.</p>

  <p>And here comes one of the mysteries which bear directly upon that
  definition of spirit law which is so desirable. In spite of the possibility
  of using vast power there is a clear, and so far as credible records go, an
  unbroken ordinance that a ghost may not for its own personal ends destroy
  anything or injure anyone. This may seem in contradiction to the broken
  coffins, but that may not have been for personal ends, but an accident due to
  the falling about of the heavy weights. Here is an authentic case in
  illustration:</p>

  <p>A great friend of mine, a Roman Catholic priest, whose word could not be
  doubted by anyone who knew him, was sent for a rest cure to a lonely house
  upon the coast which was frequently used by other priests for the same
  purpose. Save for an old crone and one or two charitable visitors, he was
  absolutely alone. After a few days he became conscious of strange noises in
  the house, which at last reached such a point that, to quote his own
  description, "it sounded at night as if there were a steam-engine snorting
  and clanking in the room below." Nothing was visible, but the sounds were
  incessant and were heard by two visitors as clearly as by the inmate. The
  priest is himself open more than most men to psychic impressions, and upon
  that night he had a dream or vision which was so absolutely clear that he
  determined to act upon it. He descended in the morning and asked the old
  woman whether there was not an unused room in the basement. She answered that
  there was. He entered it and found that he had already seen it in his dream
  &mdash;a small dusty, cobwebbed place with some old books of theology heaped
  in the corners. He walked at once to one of these heaps, picked up a book as
  in his dream, opened it, took out a sheet of written paper, glanced at it to
  make sure that it was really as revealed and then carried it into the
  kitchen, where he stuffed it between the bars of the grate. The paper was a
  written preparation for confession, made out by some over- conscientious or
  over-methodical inmate of the house, who had noted down a good many more
  things than were desirable for public perusal. Presumably he had died shortly
  afterwards and had been worried by the recollection of this document, which
  he then took these means to have destroyed. There were no further
  disturbances of any sort within the house.</p>

  <p>Now here is a story which is undoubtedly true and which cannot be met by
  any of the ingenious explanations of the honest but sceptical Researcher. If
  the subconscious knowledge of my friend could have told him that the paper
  was there, it certainly could not have caused the noises which alarmed him.
  It has to be examined as a fact, as the zoologist already quoted would
  examine the skin of his rare animal. The unhappy spirit could apparently draw
  power either from the old housekeeper or, as is more likely, from the young
  and psychic priest, to shake the very house with vibrations, and yet with all
  this power he could not destroy a frail sheet of paper, but had to bring its
  destruction about in this indirect fashion. This seems to be a solid and
  noteworthy conclusion. All authentic tales where spirits linger, earth-bound
  because they appear to be worried over earthly things, concealed treasure,
  lost documents, or other such matters, come into this category, and the
  question which one naturally asks, "Why can't they set the matter right for
  themselves?" is answered by, "They have not the power. It is against the
  law."</p>

  <p>I believe that all these varied experiences have been sent to us not to
  amuse us by tales to be told and then forgotten, but as the essential warp
  and woof of a new spiritual garment which is to be woven for the modern world
  We live in an age which has long demanded a sign, yet when the sign was sent
  it was blind to it. I cannot understand the frame of mind of those who view
  proofs of survival which appear in the Bible as of most vital importance, and
  yet close their mind to the same thing when they reappear before our very
  eyes. I believe most of the evidence in the sacred books, where it is not
  perverted by mistranslation, interposition or forgery, to be perfectly good
  evidence, but no honest mind could say that judged by human standards of
  credibility it could, for an instant, compare in its demonstration of the
  fate which awaits the soul, with the psychic revelations of recent years. In
  the latter case the witnesses are thousands in number, are men of the highest
  credibility, and have placed in many cases their personal experiences upon
  record so that any objection can be lodged. Modern Britain does not disprove
  but confirms ancient Judea. We are in a more scientific age, however, and we
  wish to know the how and the why. Such inquiries are no longer, with so great
  a wealth of material, beyond the scope of our brains. In this article I have
  endeavoured to indicate two well-marked laws: the one that it is the effluvia
  of the human organism which furnish the basis of physical manifestations from
  the unseen; the other, that there is a strict limitation of psychic power
  which does not prevent noise and subsequent disturbance, but does stand in
  the way of destruction or personal violence.</p>

  <p>This power of producing noise and commotion may, it is true, cause such
  great misery to those who endure it that it may amount to mental torture.
  There is the well-known case of Miss Clavion, the famous French actress, who
  refused the advances of a young Breton suitor. The man died two years later
  with menaces against Miss Clavion upon his lips. He was as good as his word
  and proved the wisdom of her rejection by the unmanly persecution to which he
  subjected her after his death. This took the form of loud cries, which
  frequently broke out when she was in the company of others, and were so
  terrible that some of the hearers fainted. In the later stages of her
  persecution these cries gave place to the sound of a musket going off, which
  occurred once a day through a particular window of her house. On ninety days
  running this phenomenon occurred, and was most fully investigated as the
  cries had also been, by the Parisian police, who placed spies in the street
  and sought constantly but in vain for any normal explanation. Finally, after
  two years the persecution stopped, the time having been foretold by the dead
  man, who declared that he would upset her life for the same period as she had
  upset his. He had certainly done so, but like all revenge, it was probably a
  two- edged knife which cut him more deeply than his victim.</p>

  <p>A more justifiable persecution, but one which also amounted to torture, is
  detailed by Mrs. Carter Hall, the authoress, as having come within her
  personal observation in her youth. In this case a young officer had inflicted
  the greatest of all injuries upon a beautiful young woman, who afterwards
  died. The resulting persecution may have come not from her gentle spirit, but
  from that of someone who loved her and desired to avenge her, but it was of
  the most atrocious character. Particulars will be found in Mr. Dale Owen's
  <i>Footfalls</i>&mdash;a book so accurate in its cases and so wise in its
  deductions that it should be a classic upon this subject. The unfortunate
  officer was attended wherever he went by such noises and disturbances that at
  last no landlady would let rooms to him, and he was hunted from house to
  house, a miserable and despairing man, alternately praying for relief and
  cursing at his unseen enemy. No dog would stay with him, and even his
  relatives were scared at his company, so that he had to leave his home for
  fear of driving his mother and sister into an asylum. "It is hard to be so
  punished," he said to Mrs. Carter Hall, "but perhaps I have deserved it."
  Possibly this admission may have proved to be the dawn of better
  days.</p><br>

  WRITINGS OF KNOWN AUTHORS</a></h2>

  <h3>OSCAR WILDE&mdash;JACK LONDON &mdash;<br>

  <h3>No magazine publication located<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">From time to time communications have come through mediums
  which are alleged to emanate from men who have been famous in literature.
  These have been set aside by the ordinary critic, who starts with the
  assumption that the thing is in a general sense absurd, and therefore applies
  the same judgment with little or no examination to the particular case. Those
  of us, however, who have found that many psychic claims have actually been
  made good, may be inclined to look a little more closely into these
  compositions, and judge how far, from internal evidence, the alleged
  authorship is possible or absurd. I venture to say that an impartial critic
  who approached the subject from this angle will be rather surprised at the
  result.</p>

  <p>Let us predicate on the first instance that if the Spiritualist hypothesis
  is true, and if things are carried out exactly as they say, then one would
  expect the posthumous work to be inferior to that of the living man. In the
  first place, he is filtering it through another brain which may often
  misinterpret or misunderstand. Even a typewriter under my own control, causes
  me, I find, to lose something of my sureness of touch, and how much more
  would it be if it were an unstable human machine which I was endeavouring to
  operate. In the second place, the writer has entered upon a new life with a
  new set of experiences, and with the tremendous episode of physical
  dissolution between him and the thoughts of earth. This also may well show
  itself in his style and diction. The most that we can hope for is something
  which is strongly reminiscent of the deceased writer. This, of course, might
  be produced by parody, and we have to ask ourselves how far such a parody is
  likely or even possible in the case of the particular medium. If that medium
  has never shown signs of the rare power of parody, if he has had no previous
  literary experience, and if there are other internal evidences of the
  author's identity, then the case becomes a stronger one. In no event could
  the judgment be absolutely final, but if several instances can be adduced,
  each of which is cogent, then the collective effect would tend to greatly
  strengthen the psychic proof of identity.</p>

  <p>I would first take the alleged messages of Oscar Wilde, which are
  certainly very arresting. Wilde's style was so marked, and at its best so
  remarkably beautiful, that I have never seen any admitted parody which was
  adequate. Yet there have been several communications alleged to be from the
  other side which do reproduce those peculiarities in a very marked form. One
  of these was a play which came through the hand of Mrs. Hester Dowden, and
  which exhibited both the strength and the weakness of Wilde. Another is to be
  found in that remarkable narrative, "Both Sides of the Door," where Wilde was
  alleged to have interfered, in order to save a family who were suffering from
  a peculiar psychic persecution. Wilde had a particularly fine eye for colour,
  and a very happy knack of hitting off a tint by an allusion to some natural
  object. I think that all the "honey-coloured" moons which have floated over
  recent literature had their origin in one of Wilde's adjectives. In this
  particular little book Wilde spoke of the Arctic seas as "an ocean of foaming
  jade." That struck me as a particularly characteristic phrase.</p>

  <p>In the present essay, however, we will concentrate our attention upon the
  volume which has been published by Werner Laurie under the title of
  <i>Psychic Messages from Oscar Wilde</i>. These also came through the hand of
  Mrs. Dowden (or Mrs. Travers Smith) and they are dignified by a preface from
  the father of Psychic Research, Sir William Barrett, who makes the general
  assertion concerning the script, "It does afford strong prim&acirc; facie
  evidence of survival after the dissolution of body and brain."</p>

  <p>The messages, it should be explained, came partly by automatic writing,
  while in a normal state, and partly by the ouija board. Mrs. Dowden was
  associated with Mr. Soal in the experiments, she sometimes working alone, and
  sometimes with his hands upon the ouija board. Here are some of the messages
  which seem to me to be most characteristic of Wilde's personality and
  literary style.</p>

  <p>"In eternal twilight I move, but I know that in the world there is day and
  night, seedtime and harvest, and red sunset must follow apple-green dawn.
  Every year spring throws her green veil over the world and anon the red
  autumn glory comes to mock the yellow moon. Already the may is creeping like
  a white mist over land and hedgerow, and year after year the hawthorn bears
  blood-red fruit after the death of its may."</p>

  <p>This is not merely adequate Wilde. It is exquisite Wilde. It is so
  beautiful that it might be chosen for special inclusion in any anthology of
  his writings. The adjective "apple-green" for dawn, and the picture of the
  may "creeping like a white mist" are two high lights in a brilliant passage.
  Again as in the "foaming jade" we have the quick response to colour. It is
  not too much to say that the posthumous Wilde in such passages as this is
  Wilde with an added sparkle.</p>

  <p>In the script we find that after this passage Wilde was subjected to a
  long <i>questionnaire</i>, which he answered with great precision. When asked
  why he came, he answered:</p>

  <p>"To let the world know that Oscar Wilde is not dead. His thoughts live on
  in the hearts of all those who in a gross age can hear the flute voice of
  beauty calling on the hills, or mark where her white feet brush the dew from
  the cowslips in the morning. Now the mere memory of the beauty of the world
  is an exquisite pain. I was always one of those for whom the visible world
  existed. I worshipped at the shrine of things seen. There was not a blood
  stripe on a tulip or a curve on a shell, or a tone on the sea, but had for me
  its meaning and its mystery, and its appeal to the imagination. Others might
  sip the pale lees of the cup of thought, but for me the red wine of
  life."</p>

  <p>This also is beautiful and rare literary work. If an artist can tell a
  Rubens by its colouring or a sculptor can assign an ancient statue to
  Phidias, then I claim that a man with an adequate sense of the rhythm of good
  prose can ascribe these fine extracts to Wilde and to no one else. His
  hallmark is stamped upon them for all the world to see, and when it ceases to
  turn away its head it will see it clearly enough. Immersed in trivialities,
  it seems to have no leisure at present for the great questions of life and of
  death.</p>

  <p>These two beautiful passages and several others almost as fine, came in a
  single sitting on June 8th, 1923, and were produced by Mr. Soal writing,
  while Mrs. Dowden laid her hand upon his. In many forms of mediumship it is
  to be observed that the blending of two human atmospheres produces finer
  results than either alone can get.</p>

  <p>The cynical humour of Wilde, and a certain mental arrogance which was
  characteristic, breaks out in these passages.</p>

  <p>"Being dead is the most boring experience in life. That is if one excepts
  being married, or dining with a schoolmaster."</p>

  <p>Again being dissatisfied with one of his own images he writes, "Stop!
  Stop! This image is insufferable. You write like a successful grocer who,
  from selling pork, has taken to writing poetry."</p>

  <p>When someone alluded to an occasion when Whistler had scored off him, he
  wrote, "With James vulgarity always begins at home."</p>

  <p>Again</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to burden you with details of my life, which was like a
  candle that had guttered at the end. I rather wish to make you believe that I
  was the medium through which beauty filtered, and was distilled like the
  essence of a rose."</p>

  <p>His literary criticism was acid and unjust, but witty.</p>

  <p>"I knew Yeats well&mdash;a fantastical mind, but so full of inflated joy
  in himself that his little cruse of poetry was erupted early in his career
  &mdash;a little drop of beauty which was spread only with infinite pains over
  the span of many years."</p>

  <p>Now and again there are passages of intense interest to an instructed
  Spiritualist which give a glimpse of the exact sphere upon which Wilde is
  moving, and the reasons which retard his progress and subject him to those
  limitations which draw from him the constant exclamation of "Pity Oscar
  Wilde!" His pictures of earth are a reminiscence, and his witty cynical
  chatter is a mere screen. The real bitterness of his experience, a bitterness
  which might I think have been assuaged by some sympathy and instruction from
  this side, flashes out in occasional passages which vibrate with his
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"I am a wanderer. Over the whole world I have wandered, looking for eyes
  by which I may see. At times it is given to me to pierce this strange veil of
  darkness, and through eyes from which my secret must be for ever hidden, gaze
  once more on the gracious day."</p>

  <p>This would mean in our language that from time to time he has been able to
  take control of a medium, and so get into touch with physical things once
  more. His troubles come from the desire to struggle down rather than up. He
  has found strangely assorted mediums.</p>

  <p>"I have found sight in the most curious places. Through the eyes out of
  the dusky face of a Tamil girl I have looked on the tea fields of Ceylon, and
  through the eyes of a wandering Kurd I have seen Ararat... Once on a pleasure
  steamer on its way to St. Cloud I saw the green waters of the Seine and the
  lights of Paris through the vision of a little girl, who clung wondering to
  her mother and wondered why."</p>

  <p>What rational explanation can be given for such messages save the
  Spiritualistic one? They are there. Whence come they? Are they the
  unconscious cerebration of Mr. Soal? But many of them have come when that
  gentleman was not present, so this explanation is ruled out. Are they then an
  emanation of Mrs. Dowden? But they have come in full strength and beauty when
  her hands have not been on the ouija board, but have simply touched those of
  Mr. Soal. What then is the alternative explanation? I confess that I can see
  none. Can anyone contend that both Mr. Soal and Mrs. Dowden have a hidden
  strand in their own personality which enables them on occasion to write like
  a great deceased writer, and at the same time a want of conscience which
  permits that subconscious strand to actually claim that it <i>is</i> the
  deceased author? Such an explanation would seem infinitely more unlikely than
  any transcendental one can do.</p>

  <p>The case might be made fairly convincing on the question of style alone.
  But there is much more in it than that. The actual writing, which was done at
  a speed which forbids conscious imitation, is often the handwriting of Wilde,
  and reproduces certain curious little tricks of spacing which were usual with
  him in life. He alludes freely to all sorts of episodes, many of them little
  known, which have been shown to be actual facts. He gives criticisms of
  authors with a sure, but rather unkind touch, where the medium has little or
  no acquaintance with the writings criticized. He alludes to people whom he
  has known in life with the utmost facility. In the case of one, Mrs. Chan
  Toon, the name was so unlikely that it seemed to me that there must be some
  mistake. As if to resolve my doubts a letter reached me presently from the
  very lady herself.</p>

  <p>To sum up, I do not think that any person who approached this problem with
  an open mind can doubt that the case for Wilde's survival and communication
  is an overpoweringly strong one.</p>

  <p>We now turn to a second case, that of Jack London. Here again we are
  dealing with an author who had such a marked individuality, and such a strong
  explosive method of expression that any imitation should be readily detected.
  The collector of the evidence is Edward Payne, who died soon after his task
  was completed. He was a man of considerable attainments, a close friend of
  London's in his lifetime, and not a Spiritualist, so we have the material for
  a very instructed and unprejudiced opinion. The messages came to him through
  a lady who has a public career, and therefore desires to remain anonymous.
  Mr. Payne answers for her bona fides, and assures us she was not a
  professional medium, that she was a woman of considerable culture, and that
  she was a convinced materialist, so that no strand of her own nature, so far
  as can be traced, is concerned in producing messages which are in their very
  nature the strongest indictment of materialism that could be framed.</p>

  <p>The messages assume two forms, the one quite unconvincing, the other most
  powerful. The former is an attempt at a work of fiction which was an utter
  failure. The fact that London could not get his story of worldly life across,
  and yet was most convincing in discussing his own actual condition, is to be
  understood readily. It is clear that he was attempting the most difficult of
  all forms of communication, a long, connected narrative with characters and
  plot, under indirect conditions to which no living author could submit.</p>

  <p>If London had relied upon his transmitted fiction alone he would have been
  deservedly set down as an impostor. But when he comes to draw not others, but
  himself, he is much more convincing. Apparently he was much worried after
  death by finding everything entirely different from anything he had expected,
  though if he and other materialists would deign to listen to the poor
  despised Spiritualists they would save themselves all such shocks, the
  effects of which endure often for many years.</p>

  <p>Instead of loss of personality he found himself, like Wilde, in a mist or
  haze&mdash;a reflection of his own perplexed mind&mdash;with a body and mind
  as before, the perceptions being more acute than on earth. He quickly was
  forced to realize that all his teaching had been utterly wrong, that he had
  done harm by it, and that his immediate task was to get back if he could, and
  set the matter right. This getting back is no easy task. The right vibration
  has to be found, and it is far to seek. But London was not a man to be
  repulsed. He found his vibration and he delivered his message. Here are some
  of the communications which seem to me to bear the stamp of the man on every
  line of them.</p>

  <p>"I am going to try. Trying is the life of me. Ask Aunt Netta if it is Jack
  who speaks that."</p>

  <p>"Here I am alive, feeling myself to be myself, yet nothing I say or write
  can identify me to those who know me best."</p>

  <p>"Death has taught me what earth held from me. My spirit is plunging
  forward with more vigour than wisdom, as in my earth days. But I know now the
  way and the life. Oh, I have much, much, that I must undo."</p>

  <p>He sends a long, connected communication which is an essay in itself,
  headed "What Life means to me now." In it he says, "I am a soul&mdash;a
  living Soul. I followed the lost trail of materialism, and sickened in the
  foul mists of error." The whole composition, which is too long for quotation,
  is most powerful, and might serve as a warning from the grave, to those
  millions who so heedlessly tread the very path which led London to his
  misery.</p>

  <p>"My soul, though I knew it not, was dyspeptic with the materialistic
  fodder I crammed into it... Death caught me unawares. He snapped me up when
  my face was not turned his way. I almost regret this. I believe it made my
  transition the harder.</p>

  <p>"I awoke. Dreaming? I was sure of it. I dreamed on and on. I dreamed
  myself into eternity. I am vague. I was vague to myself. My powers returned.
  I could think. I hailed my old brain like a returned friend. I fumbled and
  groped. My earth blindness was on me. It hazed me about. I fought my way
  through it. I had no goal. I had passed the only goal I had ever admitted. I
  was on the other side of it. I struggle to seize the correct term. I try
  vainly to translate the experience into terms of earth which has no utterance
  for it.</p>

  <p>"I died. I am looking at death from the other side&mdash;the tame friendly
  side of him. And Life is indestructible... I see man face his destiny as I
  saw him on earth. I see him fall. I see him rise again and go on. He fights
  his way and when his place is ready here he comes. There are no catastrophes.
  All is in order.</p>

  <p>"I am a stranger to this tongue. I am but learning to speak. What faculty
  I possessed on earth is disrupted by a condition it was never trained to
  meet. I shall strive to re-establish it and then I shall speak, and, friends
  of earth, you shall recognize my voice."</p>

  <p>These short strong pregnant sentences are Jack London at his best. As in
  the case of Wilde, his posthumous work will bear comparison with anything he
  has done in life.</p>

  <p>He has a horror of his old point of view.</p>

  <p>"That which was my truth of yesterday, which I hugged to me as the
  quintessence of my distilled thought, becomes a volatile poison to me here
  and I must ... distil a new thought out of the fires of my previous
  experience, and by this thought shall I rise. Renaissance of soul is a labour
  shot with pains of remembrance, held by fetters of past error which are burst
  with a sweated toil while the heart strains with its propulsion ... I feel
  that I have got right with God&mdash;I am no longer worshipping myself."</p>

  <p>When asked what specific work he was doing, he answered, "I have to direct
  those lost or bewildered, as I was when I came. I labour to show them the way
  I would not take."</p>

  <p>These last words seem to me to mark the beginning of Jack London's
  regeneration. He understands that his work is impersonal, unselfish and
  humble. Before that he had wished to reassert himself on the old earth terms,
  and the realization that he could not do so was a bitter one. He kicked hard
  against the pricks.</p>

  <p>"God! I am annihilated!" he cried; "my earth life is stamped out, blotted
  from time by this passage. I can't puzzle it out. My hand fumbles. Did Death
  rob me as I passed through his clutch. Did he steal the face of me that those
  who knew me see me strange, feeble, pitiful. Who or what has cut the tap-root
  of my power? I am befogged."</p>

  <p>The child still cried for its toys and refused to understand that it had
  left the nursery. But it cries in a voice that is familiar. The man himself
  never spoke in such a vital strain as does his ghost. He ends at last on the
  note that he is not to look back and that the future only should concern him.
  "The messages" he said, "come from Jack London, the damned soul, struggling
  out of his own hell of materialization." But there was light ahead. He had
  but to persevere. "I am a soldier of the eternal march." Who but Jack London
  would have written those words? He winds up, "What is more important than to
  let the world know I am busy undoing what mischief I did." Alas, Jack, the
  world is too busy with its games and its pleasures, too immersed in its
  wooden creeds and its petrified religions, to give ear to what you have
  learned. They, like you, will only realize when it is too late.</p>

  <p>It may be gathered from the above that I accept Jack London's return as
  being a genuine one. I can see no other possible conclusion. The message is
  there, and it is easier to account for it by the return of London's
  activities to this sphere, than to torture the theory of multiple personality
  or subconscious activity, until it is twisted to cover a case which is so
  much beyond its limits.</p>

  <p>There is one other writer who has claimed that he has been able to get
  messages back to us. This is Lord Northcliffe&mdash;or Alfred Harmsworth, as
  the alleged spirit prefers to be called. In life Harmsworth had no
  distinctive style, but only the pen of the ready writer, so that it is far
  more difficult to identify him than in such marked cases as Wilde or London.
  But if he had not style he had character, and this of a very forcible and
  individual kind. Judged from that angle his return is convincing, though I
  would not say that it is so conclusive as in the case of the two men of
  letters. The great journalist claims to have come through many times, and I
  have myself had experiences in that direction which cannot possibly be
  explained away. Hannen Swaffer has given his own account of the matter in his
  forcible narrative "Northcliffe's Return." For the purpose of this essay,
  however, I will confine myself to a single long article, said to be dictated
  by Northcliffe, and coming through the hand of a lady living in a small town
  in New Zealand, and quite ignorant of her control's character, or of his
  methods of thought and expression.</p>

  <p>He also, like the others, most bitterly regrets the want of true guidance
  which he had found in his lifetime, and the absorption in material things
  which stunted his spiritual development. At the same time it is easy to see
  that the spirit which is struggling for expression is really, as I should
  judge, upon a higher plane than either of those which have been already
  discussed. Service is his one ideal and that is the sign of progression. He
  speaks of his powers humbly enough.</p>

  <p>"I would probably not have risen above the rank of private yet had it not
  been for some executive ability. For the will power and the dynamic force
  necessary to achieve success in my old line of endeavour has helped me
  considerably here."</p>

  <p>His review of his own earth life is interesting and instructive:</p>

  <p>"I had a tremendous lot of power in public affairs, and I now see to how
  much better use I might have put that power. But I could only act according
  to my light at the time, and as that light was very dim indeed, on matters
  pertaining to the more real and lasting things of life, I made many mistakes.
  We do not suffer for our mistakes, except in witnessing the results of past
  actions, which is suffering enough in many cases, God knows! What I mean is,
  that this suffering is self-inflicted, and the only escape from it is in
  honest toil to try and right some of the wrong we have unwittingly done in
  the past. In this way only can we wipe the slate clean and start life afresh
  on a higher level."</p>

  <p>Now and again he breaks out into that impetuous and loud-spoken anger
  which was one of his earth characteristics. Here is an example when he talks
  of our present misleaders of public opinion:</p>

  <p>"The colossal ignorance and arrogant pride of so many of those whose
  privilege it is to help to form public opinion is my especial bugbear at
  present. If they would not be so smug and self-satisfied about it I could
  bear it better. But, as things are, I often long to prick the highly-inflated
  bubble of their unholy conceit with one of my sharp, old-time, vigorous
  denunciations of humbug."</p>

  <p>And again he has a word to say to those who imagine that to commune with
  those who are gone can in any way be harmful or disagreeable to those who
  come to us.</p>

  <p>"Poor silly, deluded folks! If they only knew what I, and millions like me
  know of the heart-hunger for those left behind, which exists over here, they
  would open their minds and hearts, and make their dear ones as welcome in
  their lives and concerns as they were before death overtook them. They could
  do it easily, too, if they would only allow themselves to be properly
  instructed in these matters of great moment to all concerned, by those who
  know, instead of being content to listen to those shrill, oft-repeated,
  parrot cries of religious humbugs, who tell of the sin and danger of
  tampering with these things, whilst knowing nothing whatever of the help and
  consolation such intercourse can bring to loving, suffering beings on both
  sides of the veil."</p>

  <p>Can anyone imagine that these forceful words, which can be matched in
  unpublished communications from the same source in England, could have really
  come from the mind of the lady in far New Zealand.</p>

  <p>In theoriginal form of this essay, which appeared in the <i>Fortnightly
  Review</i>, I devoted some space to considering a continuation of Edwin
  Drood, which professed to come from Charles Dickens through the hand of one
  James who was foreman in a printing office in Brattleborough, Vermont. No one
  who reads it can deny that it is an excellent imitation of the great author's
  style, but the most unconvincing part was the narrative itself, which was
  clumsy and improbable. My conclusion was "that the actual inspiration of
  Dickens is far from being absolutely established." I added, however, "No one
  with any critical faculty would say that the result was an entirely unworthy
  one, though if written by the living Dickens it would certainly not have
  improved his reputation. It reads," I added, "like Dickens gone flat."</p>

  <p>There was an extraordinarily interesting sequel to this. Shortly after I
  had written as above I had a sitting with Florizel von Reuter the celebrated
  violin virtuoso, and his mother. Their (or rather her) mediumship is of a
  most convincing nature, as its technique is in itself of abnormal power. She
  sits with her eyes tightly bandaged, and her hand upon a small pointer which
  darts very rapidly at the letters of the alphabet, while her son writes down
  the result. There is no question at all about the bandage being adequate, and
  she does not turn her face down to the board. The letters too, are so close
  together that she could not learn to touch them with accuracy. Yet the
  messages come through with extreme speed. Whatever their value there is no
  question that they come in preternatural fashion.</p>

  <p>Imagine us there, seated, these two at the centre table, my wife and I in
  the corner of our cottage room. Dickens and Drood had been in my mind, but
  our visitors had no means of knowing that. Florizel von Reuter had never read
  <i>Edwin Drood</i>. His mother had read it years ago but had a very vague
  memory as to the book. Suddenly the pointer begins to dart furiously and
  Florizel reads off each sentence as he notes it down Some of them, I may add,
  came in looking-glass writing and had to be read backwards. The first was,
  "Boz is buzzing about." Boz, of course, was the nom-de-plume of Dickens, so I
  asked if it was he. He eagerly declared that it was. After a short
  interchange of dialogue I said, "Will you answer some questions?"</p>

  <p>"I hope I know enough," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"Was that American who finished <i>Edwin Drood</i> inspired?"</p>

  <p>"Not by me," was the instantaneous and decided answer.</p>

  <p>Now von Reuter knew nothing of this matter, and my own opinion was, at the
  utmost, neutral, so that this positive answer reflected none of our own
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>Then came a further message.</p>

  <p>"Wilkie C. did" [or would have done] "better."</p>

  <p>There was, I believe, some talk after Dickens' death of Wilkie Collins
  finishing the book. So far as I know he did nothing in the matter. The von
  Reuters knew nothing of this.</p>

  <p>"Was Edwin Drood dead?"</p>

  <p>"No, he was not."</p>

  <p>That was certainly my own opinion so I make a present of it to the
  telepathist.</p>

  <p>Then after a pause, the message went on:</p>

  <p>"I was sorry to go across before I got him out of his trouble. The poor
  chap has had a hard time. I don't know which is better, to solve the mystery
  in your note-book or let it remain a mystery for ever. If you make good with
  Conrad I will put you on to Edwin."</p>

  <p>"I shall be honoured, Mr. Dickens."</p>

  <p>"Charles, if you please. We like friends to be friends." The reader will
  smile at this. So did I. But facts are facts and I am giving them. I
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Have you a clear recollection of the plot?"</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"Who was Datchery?"</p>

  <p>"What about the fourth dimension? I prefer to write it all out through
  you."</p>

  <p>What the fourth dimension has to do with it I cannot imagine. I think it
  was meant as chaff, since the fourth dimension is what no one can
  understand.</p>

  <p>Now comes the important sentence:</p>

  <p>"Edwin is alive and Chris is hiding him."</p>

  <p>This seems to me to be exceedingly important, both from a literary and
  from a psychic point of view. Some of the best brains in the world have
  occupied themselves over the problem as to whether Drood was dead, and if not
  where he could be. Numerous solutions have been suggested, but though I am
  fairly well posted in the matter this is an entirely new one. Chris is the
  Rev. Crisparkle, who in the novel is a kindly and energetic, muscular
  Christian. Certainly if he played the part indicated it is well concealed.
  But then it was the author's duty to conceal it well. There are several
  subtle touches which might point to the truth of it. On re-reading the
  fragment with this idea in my mind I can say with certainty that up to a
  point Crisparkle certainly knew nothing about it. He has a soliloquy to that
  effect, and whatever means are legitimate by which an author may mislead a
  reader, a false soliloquy is not among them. But after that point in the
  story there is no reason why Crisparkle may not have surprised Drood's
  secret, and helped him. There was a huge cupboard in Crisparkle's room which
  is described with a detail which seems unnecessary and exaggerated if nothing
  is to come from it. There again the artist drew his frontispiece under
  Dickens' very particular direction, and it contains small vignettes of
  various scenes. There is one which shows Drood standing in a sort of vault,
  and someone who has some indications of clerical garb coming in to him with a
  lantern. Is this not Crisparkle and is it not some corroboration of the
  spirit message?</p>

  <p>We got no more messages at that time. Let us for a moment, however,
  consider the case. Is it not clear evidence of an intelligence outside
  ourselves? I do not insist upon Charles Dickens. If anyone says to me, "How
  can you prove that it was not an Impersonation?" I would admit frankly that I
  cannot prove it. There is none of that corroboration from style which I get
  in the case of Wilde and of London. I put it on the broader basis, "Was it
  not an Intelligence apart from ourselves?" Whence came an ingenious solution
  of a mystery which involved a character of which neither of the von Reuters
  knew anything with a solution entirely new to me. I claim that it was a most
  evidential case of Intelligence outside our own physical bodies.</p>

  <p>I may add that on the same evening we had a number of messages in Arabic
  which none of us could understand. When, however, I sent them to my friend,
  Major Marriott, who is a competent Arabic scholar, they proved to be quite
  correct. This reinforces the argument that the Dickens' messages were quite
  apart from ourselves.</p>

  <p>Before I close my comments upon "dead" authors I might mention two other
  points of contact which had in each case some evidential value. Both were
  effected through the von Reuters&mdash;once in my presence and once in my
  absence. In the former case the message, delivered as before by the
  blindfolded lady, purported to be from Joseph Conrad, whom I had not known in
  life. He said that he had left a book unfinished, that it dealt with the
  Napoleonic era, and that he would be glad if I would finish it for him, since
  he knew that I had worked on that epoch. Neither I nor the von Reuters had
  any idea that such a book existed. We found on inquiry, however, that it was
  indeed so, and that the book had actually been published a year or two before
  in its incomplete form. This, of course, lessens the value of the evidence
  from a psychic research point of view, since we might have heard of the book
  and forgotten about it, but the fact remains that none of us had any
  recollection of it.</p>

  <p>On another occasion when I was not present the name "Jerome" came through.
  On being asked whether it was a Christian or a surname the characteristic
  answer came:</p>

  <p>"It is my alpha and omega."</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to Sir Arthur," came next.</p>

  <p>"Did you know him in life?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, yes" (very excitedly).</p>

  <p>"Would you like to write with my son's hand?" He assented eagerly.</p>

  <p>Florizel von Reuter, who had the gift of automatic writing, then took the
  pencil. A message came through that Jerome and I had been good friends, but
  had disagreed upon the subject of Occultism. The message concluded, "Tell him
  from me that I know now that he was right and I was wrong. We never know our
  greatest mistakes at the time we make them. Make it clear to him that I am
  not dead."</p>

  <p>In von Renter's account of this incident in his remarkable book,
  <i>Psychical Experiences of a Musician,</i> he says:</p>

  <p>"I should like to impress upon the reader that neither my mother nor I had
  the least idea whether Doyle and Jerome had been even superficially
  acquainted, let alone knowing anything of Jerome's views upon occult
  matters."</p>

  <p>The latter cases are certainly not so convincing as the earlier ones, but
  if you take all the evidence together it adds, I think, a new and little
  explored region to psychic research.</p><br>

     id="chap7">SOME CURIOUS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES</a></h2>

  <h3>No magazine publication located<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">My experiences with mediums, good, bad and indifferent, are
  probably as wide as those of any living man. At one time or another I have
  experimented with Jonson of Los Angeles, whom I look upon as the best
  materializing medium whom I have known, with Inez Wagner of the same city, a
  wonderful voice medium, with Mrs. Wickland and with Miss Besinnet of Toledo,
  who is also of the first psychic quality. I have sat also in America with Mr.
  John Ticknor, a gifted amateur; with Mrs. Chenoweth, the famous clairvoyante;
  with Mrs. Wriedt of Detroit and Valiantine, wonderful direct voice exponents;
  with "Margery" Crandon, the world-famous amateur; with Miss Ridley of
  Philadelphia; Mrs. Pruden of Cincinnati; Mrs. Rose Miller of Washington; Mrs.
  Hazel of Winnipeg; the Hamilton circle in the same city, and many others. In
  Australasia I experimented with Bailey, the apport medium; Mrs. Susanna
  Harris; Mrs. Roberts of Dunedin, and several more. In South Africa with Mrs.
  Kimpton, and half a dozen more. In Paris with "Eva" and with Madame Briffaud.
  In Denmark with Einar Nielson. In Sweden with the remarkable daughter of
  Judge Dahl.</p>

  <p>At home there are few mediums of the last twenty years whom I have not
  sampled, including Husk and Craddock of the older generation, and Evan Powell
  (at his best at the top of the list), Mrs. Roberts, Mrs. Garrett, Mrs.
  Barkel, Mrs. Brittain (all four splendid clairvoyantes), Mrs. Roberts Johnson
  and Mrs. Cooper (both of them overworked voice mediums), and a great many
  others of lesser note.</p>

  <p>I have worked also many times with Hope of Crewe, who in his own line is
  the greatest medium of all time, and with Mrs. Deane, both of them exponents
  of psychic photography. These are some of the mediums whose gifts I have
  explored, and in many cases I have sat as often as a dozen times. Hence, if I
  have formed conclusions they have been based upon wide experiences. I have
  always taken copious notes of my cases. Fraud I have discovered, and helped
  to expose in several cases, but on the whole I should not put it at more than
  ten per cent&mdash;if as much&mdash;of the whole.</p>

  <p>With so much practical work behind me the reader can imagine my feelings
  when in a public debate upon the subject with Dr. Haldane of Cambridge my
  distinguished opponent said, "I once knew a medium." In my reply I asked him
  what he would think of me if I contradicted him upon some point of chemistry,
  and said, "I have once been in a laboratory."</p>

  <p>Apart from the ordinary phenomena of the s&eacute;ance room, my life has
  not given me much direct psychic experience. I have, so far as I know, no
  spiritual gifts myself and none of that psychic atmosphere which gives a
  tinge of romance to so many lives. There have, however, been occasions when
  without the aid of a medium I have been sensitive to the unknown.</p>

  <p>One instance occurred some years ago. It was in my bedroom at Crowborough.
  I wakened in the night with the clear consciousness that there was someone in
  the room, and that the presence was not of this world. I was lying with my
  back to the room, acutely awake, but utterly unable to move. It was
  physically impossible for me to turn my body and face this visitor. I heard
  measured steps across the room. I was conscious (without seeing it) that
  someone was bending over me, and then I heard a voice saying in a loud
  whisper, "Doyle, I come to tell you that I am sorry." A minute later my
  disability disappeared, and I was able to turn, but all was black darkness
  and perfectly still. My wife had not awakened, and knew nothing of what had
  passed.</p>

  <p>It was no dream, I was perfectly conscious all the time. My visitor gave
  no name, but I felt that it was a certain individual to whom I had tried to
  give psychic consolation when he was bereaved. He rejected my advances with
  some contempt and died himself shortly afterwards. It may well be that he
  wished to express regret. As to my own paralysis it came, I have no doubt,
  from the fact that the power for the manifestation had been drawn out of ME.
  When spirit manifests upon the physical plane it has to draw its matter from
  a material source, and I was the obvious one. It is the one occasion upon
  which I have been used as a physical medium, and I am content that it should
  be the last.</p>

  <p>I had a second interesting experience some years ago. There was a church
  in the neighbourhood which had the reputation of being haunted. There are
  reasons why it would be wrong for me to indicate it more precisely. The party
  consisted of my wife and myself, my two sons, my daughter, a friend, and a
  young London lady who is among our rising poets. It was ten o'clock when we
  presented ourselves at the door of the church, where we were met by an
  elderly villager. Swinging a lantern he led the way to the choir end, where
  we all seated ourselves in the stalls which the ancient monks once occupied.
  My own very angular throne was that which had been used by many priors, in
  far-off days when the old church was one of the shrines of England. Opposite
  me, and dimly lit by the lantern, was the altar, and behind it a blank wall
  unbroken by any window, but reflecting strange ghostly shadows and
  illuminations through the high clerestory windows on either side. When the
  lantern was extinguished and we sat in the darkness watching these strange
  shifting lights coming and going, the impression was quite ghostly enough,
  though I have no doubt at all that there was a physical cause, due to some
  reflection of passing lights in the distance. It was, however, sufficiently
  weird.</p>

  <p>For two hours I had sat in the dark upon my hard seat, and wondered
  whether cushions were vouchsafed to the priors of old. The lights still came
  and went behind the altar, but they only flickered over the top of the high
  expanse which faced us, and all below was very black. And then suddenly,
  quite suddenly, there came that which no scepticism could explain away. It
  may have been forty feet from where I sat to the altar, and midway between,
  or roughly twenty feet from me, there was a dull haze of light, a sort of
  phosphorescent cloud, a foot or so across, and about a man's height from the
  ground. We had been rustling and whispering, but the sudden utter silence
  showed me that my companions were as tense as I was. The light glimmered
  down, and hardened into a definite shape&mdash;or I should say shapes
  &mdash;since there were two of them. They were two perfectly clear-cut
  figures in black and white, with a dim luminosity of their own. The colouring
  and arrangement gave me a general idea of cassocks and surplices. Whether
  they were facing the altar or facing each other, was more than I could say,
  but they were not misty figures, but solid objective shapes. For two or three
  minutes we all gazed at this amazing spectacle. Then my wife said loudly,
  "Friends, is there anything which we can do to help you?" In an instant they
  were gone, and we were peering into unbroken darkness with the lights still
  flickering above.</p>

  <p>Personally, I saw no more, but those of our party who sat upon the right,
  said that they could afterwards see a similar figure, but somewhat taller
  &mdash;a man alone&mdash;who stood on the left of the altar. For my own part
  nothing more occurred, and when midnight tolled forth above our heads, I
  thought it was time to make for the waiting motor.</p>

  <p>Such was our experience. There was no possible room for error.
  Unquestionably we all saw these figures, and equally unquestionably the
  figures were not of this world. I was full of curiosity to know more of the
  matter, and presently my desire was gratified, for there came into my Psychic
  Bookshop a gentleman, Mr. Munro, who had had a similar experience some years
  before in the same place. He was possessed, however, of the great gift of
  clairvoyance, and his adventure was by day light, so that it was far more
  definite. He was going round the old church when he was suddenly aware of an
  ancient monk who was walking by his side, and he knew by his own sensations
  that it was a clairvoyant vision. The man was middle sized, with a keen,
  aristocratic, hawk- like face. So clear was he that Mr. Munro remembered how
  the sunlight shone upon the arched bone of his prominent nose. He walked for
  some time beside Mr. Munro, and he then vanished. What is noticeable is that
  he was wearing a gown of a peculiar tint of yellow. Some little time
  afterwards my informant was present at Bernard Shaw's noble play of "Saint
  Joan." In one act an English monk appears upon the stage. My friend instantly
  said to his wife, "That is the dress. That is what the dead man wore." Mrs.
  Munro, who was in the shop at the time, confirmed this. I may say that they
  had broached the subject before I had told them of our own experience in the
  old church.</p>

  <p>Then again there came yet another light upon the matter. It was, strange
  to say, in an Australian paper which was sent to me. It gave an account of
  the old church, and of the ghosts which haunt it. The chief spirit, the one
  with the masterful face, was, according to this narrative, the head of the
  community in the time of Henry the Eighth. He had hid some of the treasures
  of the church to prevent their spoliation, and his spirit was still
  earth-bound on account of his solicitude over these buried relics. His name
  was given, and it was stated that he had shown himself to many visitors. If
  this account be indeed true, then I should think that the spot in front of
  the altar, where we saw first the light, and then the two draped figures,
  might very possibly be worth the attention of the explorer.</p>

  <p>I joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1893 or 1894 and must now
  be one of the oldest members. Shortly afterwards I was asked to form one of a
  small party to inspect a house at Charmouth. It was said to be haunted.</p>

  <p>Dr. Scott of Norwood and Mr. Podmore, a determined and very unreasonable
  opponent of spiritualism, were my companions. The evidence in the case was so
  voluminous that it took us the whole of our railway journey to master it. It
  consisted mainly of a record of senseless noises which made the place hardly
  habitable for the unfortunate family who had it on a lease and could not
  afford to abandon it.</p>

  <p>They proved to be charming people. An elderly mother, a grown-up son and a
  married daughter.</p>

  <p>The house was a rambling place, a couple of centuries old. We sat up for
  two nights. On the first nothing occurred. On the second Dr. Scott left us,
  and I sat alone with Mr. Podmore and the young man. We had, of course, taken
  every precaution to checkmate fraud, put worsted thread across the stairs,
  and so on.</p>

  <p>We had just begun to think that the second night would be as blank as the
  first and the ladies had already gone to bed when a fearsome noise broke out.
  It was like someone whacking a table with a heavy stick. The door of the
  sitting-room was open and the noise reverberated down the passage.</p>

  <p>We rushed into the kitchen from which the sound appeared to come, but
  there was nothing to be seen there, and the threads on the stair were
  unbroken. The others returned to the sitting-room, but I remained waiting in
  the dark in the hope that the noise would break out once more. There was,
  however, no return and we were never able to cast a light upon the mystery.
  We could only say that what we had heard corroborated, up to a point, what we
  had read in the account of the disturbances.</p>

  <p>There was, however, a curious sequel. Within a year or so the house was
  burnt down, which may or may not have had a connection with the mischievous
  sprite who appeared to haunt it. A suggestive thing, however, was that the
  skeleton of a child about ten years old was dug up in the garden. This I had
  from relatives of the family who were so plagued.</p>

  <p>Some people think that a young life cut short in an unnatural fashion may
  leave, as it were, a store of unused vitality which may be put to strange
  uses.</p>

  <p>I was never asked by the Society for a report of this case, but Podmore
  sent one in, ascribing the noises to the young man, though as a matter of
  fact, he was actually sitting with us in the parlour when the trouble began.
  Therefore, the explanation given by Podmore was absolutely impossible. I
  think that if we desire truth we should not only be critical of all psychic
  assertions, but equally so of all so-called exposures in this subject. I am
  sorry to say that in some cases the exposure means downright fraud upon the
  part of the critic.</p>

  <p>One other curious experience comes back to my memory. Shortly after the
  War I had a letter from the widow of a distinguished soldier living at Alton,
  Hampshire, in which she stated that her life was made miserable by a noisy
  haunting of her house, which frightened the children and drove away the
  servants.</p>

  <p>I visited her, however, to see what I could do. She had taken it as a
  furnished house with a lease of some years, and it was impossible for her to
  leave it.</p>

  <p>I found that the lady was, herself, very psychic, and had the power of
  automatic writing. Through this it was that she received the name of the
  entity which haunted the house and she assured me that on making inquiries
  she found, after some time, that a person of that name had actually inhabited
  the house some sixty years before. On asking him why his spirit should be so
  restless she received the answer that some papers about which he was anxious
  were concealed in the rafters of the box-room.</p>

  <p>This message had actually just come through and the box-room had not yet
  been explored. It was a terrible place, thick with dust and piled with all
  kinds of lumber, and for an hour or more, in my shirt and trousers, I crawled
  about under the rafters looking for these papers. I observed, however, that
  at some period, a bell wire had been passed along there, and it was clear to
  me that the men who fixed the wire would certainly have come upon any
  concealed packet. I therefore, made my way back to the sitting-room in a
  shocking state of dust and perspiration and then and there the lady and I
  held a table-sitting in which I addressed the unseen entity and explained to
  him that the papers, if they had ever been there, were certainly gone.</p>

  <p>I remonstrated with him for the trouble which he had given to the
  household and I begged him to think no more of his worldly affairs, but to
  attune his mind to the higher life. When I asked him if he would do so the
  table spelt D.V.</p>

  <p>I am conscious that this is very vague and open to criticism, but the
  direct sequel of it all was that from that day onwards the trouble entirely
  ceased, and the lady was able to write and to assure me that the atmosphere
  of her house had changed to one of deep peace.</p>

  <p>Thus my visit to Alton was not entirely in vain.</p><br>
  <br>

  <h3>No magazine publication located<br>

  <br>

  <p>I propose in this essay to discuss the evidence for the existence of
  elemental forms of life, invisible to the normal eye, which inhabit the same
  planet as ourselves.* It seems to me that our knowledge of the ether
  vibrations which govern wireless are a great help to us in this connection,
  and that we can readily understand now what would have been incomprehensible,
  because there was no existing analogy, a few years ago. Let us suppose that
  the London centre was the only one known, and that we were in touch with it
  through our own receiving apparatus. That represents our reaction to the
  material world and normally we know of no other, just as the wireless
  recipient would know only London. But we find that by a very small change of
  vibration or wave-length we get Paris, Berlin, or Constantinople, and London
  has vanished. Now if we apply that to psychic vibrations the analogy seems to
  me very close. As Paracelsus said, "Ut infra, ita supra" (As it is below so
  it is above). A uniformity runs through the scheme of creation. The
  clairvoyant whose various powers of receptivity enable him to contact
  different types of extra-corporeal creatures, corresponds to the man who can
  switch from one centre to another, and he has the same difficulty in getting
  his results accepted as the owner of a wave- adjustment set would have if all
  the normal world was confined to one vibration.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* An expansion of this general argument is to be found
  in <i>The Coming of the Fairies</i>, Psychic Press, 2 Victoria Street, W.
  ]</p>

  <p>To vary the simile, we are accustomed to the idea of amphibious creatures
  who may dwell unseen and unknown in the depths of the waters, and then some
  day be spied sunning themselves upon a sandbank, whence they slip into the
  unseen once more. If such appearances were rare, and if it should so happen
  that some saw them more clearly than others, then a very pretty controversy
  would arise, for the sceptics would say with every show of reason, "Our
  experience is that only land creatures live on the land, and we utterly
  refuse to believe in things which slip in and out of the water; if you will
  demonstrate them to us we will begin to consider the question." Faced by so
  reasonable an opposition the others could only mutter that they had seen them
  with their eyes, but that they could not command their movements. The
  sceptics would hold the field.</p>

  <p>Something of the sort may exist in our psychic arrangements. One can well
  imagine that there is a dividing line, like the water edge, this line
  depending upon what we vaguely call a higher rate of vibrations. Taking the
  vibration theory as a working hypothesis, one could conceive that by raising
  or lowering them, creatures could move from one side to the other of this
  line of material visibility, as the tortoise moves from the water to the
  land, returning for refuge to invisibility as the reptile scuttles back to
  the surf. This, of course, is supposition, but intelligent supposition based
  on the available evidence is the pioneer of science, and it may be that the
  actual solution will be found in this direction. I am alluding, now, not to
  spirit return, where eighty years of close observation have given us some
  sort of certain and definite laws, but rather of those fairy and phantom
  phenomena which have been endorsed by so many ages, and even in these
  material days seem to break into some lives in the most unexpected fashion.
  Victorian science would have left the world hard and clean and bare, like a
  landscape in the moon, but this science is in truth but a little light in the
  darkness, and outside that limited circle of definite knowledge we see the
  loom and shadow of gigantic and fantastic possibilities around us, throwing
  themselves continually across our consciousness in such ways that it is
  difficult to ignore them.</p>

  <p>There is much curious evidence of varying value concerning these
  borderland forms, which come or go either in fact or imagination&mdash;the
  latter most frequently no doubt. And yet there remains a residue which by all
  human standards should point to occasional facts. I pass in this essay the
  age- long tradition which is so universal and consistent, and come down to
  some modern instances which make one feel that this world is very much more
  complex than we had imagined, and that there may be upon its surface some
  very strange neighbours who will open up inconceivable lines of science for
  our posterity, especially if it should be made easier for them, by sympathy
  or other help, to emerge from the deep and manifest upon the margin.</p>

  <p>Taking a large number of cases of fairy lore which lie before me, there
  are two points which are common to nearly all of them. One is that children
  claim to see these creatures far more frequently than adults. This may
  possibly come from greater sensitiveness of apprehension, or it may depend
  upon these little entities having less fear of molestation from the children.
  The other is that more cases are recorded in which they have been seen in the
  still shimmering hours of a very hot day than at any other time. "The action
  of the sun upon the brain," the sceptic says. Possibly&mdash;and also
  possibly not. If it were a question of raising the slower vibrations of our
  surroundings one could imagine that still heat would be the very condition
  which might favour such a change. What is the mirage of the desert? What is
  that scene of hills and lakes which a whole caravan can see while it faces in
  a direction where for a thousand miles of desert there is neither hill nor
  lake, nor any cloud or moisture to produce refraction? I can ask the question
  but I do not venture to give an answer. It is clearly a phenomenon which is
  not to be confused with the erect or often inverted image which is seen in a
  land of clouds and of moisture.</p>

  <p>There are many people who have a recollection of these experiences of
  their youth and try afterwards to explain them away on material grounds which
  do not seem adequate or reasonable. Thus in his excellent book on Folklore
  the Rev. S. Baring-Gould gives us a personal experience which illustrates
  several of the points already mentioned.</p>

  <p>"In the year 1838," he says, "when I was a small boy, four years old, we
  were driving to Montpelier on a hot summer day over the long straight road
  that traverses a pebble and rubble-strewn plain on which grows nothing save a
  few aromatic herbs. I was sitting on the box with my father when to my great
  surprise I saw legions of dwarfs of about two feet high running along beside
  the horses&mdash;some sat laughing on the pole, some were scrambling up the
  harness to get on the backs of the horses. I remarked to my father what I
  saw, when he abruptly stopped the carriage and put me inside beside my
  mother, where, the conveyance being closed, I was out of the sun. The effect
  was that little by little the host of imps diminished in numbers till they
  disappeared altogether."</p>

  <p>Here certainly the advocates of sunstroke have a strong though by no means
  a final case. Mr. Baring-Gould's next illustration is a stronger one.</p>

  <p>"When my wife was a girl of fifteen," he says, "she was walking down a
  lane in Yorkshire between green hedges, when she saw seated in one of the
  privet hedges a little green man, perfectly well made, who looked at her with
  his beady, black eyes. He was about a foot or fifteen inches high. She was so
  frightened that she ran home. She remembers that it was a summer day."</p>

  <p>A girl of fifteen is old enough to be a good witness, and her fright and
  the clear detail of her memory point to a real experience. Again we have the
  suggestion of a hot day.</p>

  <p>Baring-Gould has yet a third case.</p>

  <p>"One day a son of mine," he says, "was sent into the garden to pick pea-
  pods for the cook to shell for dinner. Presently he rushed into the house as
  white as chalk to say that while he was thus engaged, and standing between
  the rows of peas, he saw a little man wearing a red cap, a green jacket,
  brown knee- breeches, whose face was old and wan, and who had a grey beard
  and eyes as black and hard as sloes. He stared so intently at the boy that
  the latter took to his heels."</p>

  <p>Here again the pea-pods show that it was summer and probably in the heat
  of the day. Once again the detail is very exact and corresponds closely, as I
  shall presently show, to some independent accounts. Mr. Baring-Gould is
  inclined to put all these down to the heat conjuring up the familiar pictures
  of fairy-books, but some further evidence may cause the reader to doubt this
  explanation.</p>

  <p>Let us compare with these stories the very direct evidence of Mrs. Violet
  Tweedale, whose courage in making public the result of her own remarkable
  psychic faculties should meet with recognition from every student of the
  subject. Our descendants will hardly realize the difficulty which now exists
  of getting first-hand evidence with names attached, for they will have
  outgrown the state when the cry of "fake" and "fraud" and "dupe" is raised at
  once against any observer, however honourable and moderate, by people who
  know little or nothing of the subject. Mrs. Tweedale says:</p>

  <p>"I had a wonderful little experience some five years ago which proved to
  me the existence of fairies. One summer afternoon I was walking alone along
  the avenue of Lupton House, Devonshire. It was an absolutely still day
  &mdash;not a leaf moving, and all nature seemed to sleep in the hot sunshine.
  A few yards in front of me my eye was attracted by the violent movements of a
  single long, blade-like leaf of a wild iris. This leaf was swinging and
  bending energetically while the rest of the plant was motionless. Expecting
  to see a field mouse astride it I stepped very softly up to it. What was my
  delight to see a tiny green man. He was about five inches long and was
  swinging back downwards. His tiny green feet which appeared to be
  green-booted were crossed over the leaf and his hands, raised behind his
  head, also held the blade. I had a vision of a merry little face and
  something red in the form of a cap on the head. For a full minute he remained
  in view, swinging on the leaf. Then he vanished. Since then I have several
  times seen a single leaf moving violently while the rest of the plant
  remained motionless, but I have never again been able to see the cause of the
  movement."</p>

  <p>Here the dress of the fairy, green jacket and red cap, is exactly the same
  as was described independently by Baring-Gould's son, and again we have the
  elements of heat and stillness. It may be fairly answered that many artists
  have drawn the fairies in such a dress, and that the colours may in this way
  have been impressed upon the minds of both observers. In the bending iris we
  have something objective, however, which cannot easily be explained away as a
  cerebral hallucination, and the whole incident seems to me an impressive
  piece of evidence.</p>

  <p>A lady with whom I have corresponded, who is engaged in organizing work of
  the most responsible kind, has had an experience which resembles that of Mrs.
  Tweedale.</p>

  <p>"My only sight of a fairy," she says, "was in a large wood in West Sussex
  about nine years ago. He was a little creature about half a foot high dressed
  in leaves. The remarkable thing about his face was that no soul looked
  through his eyes. He was playing about in long grass and flowers in an open
  space."</p>

  <p>Once again summer is indicated. The length and colour of the creature
  correspond with Mrs. Tweedale's account, while the lack of soul in the eyes
  may be compared with the "hard" eyes described by young Baring-Gould.</p>

  <p>One of the most gifted clairvoyants in England was the late Mr. Turvey of
  Bournemouth, whose book, <i>The Beginnings of Seership</i>, should be in the
  library of every student. Mr. Lonsdale of Bournemouth is also a well-known
  sensitive. The latter has given me the following account of an incident which
  he observed some years ago in the presence of Mr. Turvey.</p>

  <p>"I was sitting," says Mr. Lonsdale, "in his company in his garden at
  Branksome Park. We sat in a hut which had an open front looking on to the
  lawn. We had been perfectly quiet for some time, neither talking nor moving,
  as was often our habit. Suddenly I was conscious of a movement on the edge of
  the lawn, which on that side went up to a grove of pine trees. Looking
  closely I saw several little figures dressed in brown peering through the
  bushes. They remained quiet for a few minutes, and then disappeared. In a few
  seconds a dozen or more small people about two feet in height, in bright
  clothes and with radiant faces, ran on to the lawn, dancing hither and
  thither. I glanced at Turvey to see if he saw anything and whispered, 'Do you
  see them?' He nodded. These fairies played about, gradually approaching the
  hut. One little fellow, bolder than the others, came to a croquet hoop close
  to the hut, and using the hoop as a horizontal bar, turned round and round
  it, much to our amusement. Some of the others watched him, while others
  danced about, not in any set dance, but seemingly moving in sheer joy. This
  continued for four or five minutes, when suddenly, evidently in response to
  some signal or warning from those dressed in brown, who had remained at the
  edge of the wood, they all ran into the wood. Just then a maid appeared
  coming from the house with tea. Never was tea so unwelcome, as evidently its
  appearance was the cause of the disappearance of our little visitors."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lonsdale adds, "I have seen fairies several times in the New Forest,
  but never so clearly as this." Here also the scene is laid in the heat of a
  summer day, and the division of the fairies into two different sorts is
  remarkably borne out by the general descriptions.</p>

  <p>Knowing Mr. Lonsdale as I do to be a responsible, well-balanced, and
  honourable man, I find such evidence as this very hard to put to one side.
  Here, at least, the sun-stroke hypothesis is negatived since both men sat in
  the shade of the hut and each corroborated the observation of the other. On
  the other hand, each of the men, like Mrs. Tweedale, was supernormal in
  psychic development, so that it might well happen that the maid, for example,
  would not have seen the fairies even if she had arrived earlier upon the
  scene.</p>

  <p>I know a gentleman belonging to one of the learned professions whose
  career would not be helped if this article were to connect him with fairy
  lore. As a matter of fact, in spite of his solemn avocations and his
  practical and virile character, he seems to be endowed with that faculty
  &mdash;let us call it the appreciation of higher vibrations, which opens up
  so wonderful a door to its possessor. He claims, or rather he admits &mdash;
  for he is reticent upon the subject&mdash;that he has carried this power of
  perception on from childhood, and his surprise is not so much at what he
  sees, as at the failure of others to see the same thing. To show that it is
  not subjective he tells the story that on one occasion while traversing a
  field he saw a little creature which beckoned eagerly that he should follow.
  He did so, and presently saw his guide pointing with an air of importance to
  the ground. There, between the furrows lay a flint arrowhead, which he
  carried home with him as a souvenir of the adventure.</p>

  <p>This gentleman is further distinguished by having that power of attracting
  animals, even wild animals, which some people have, and it may be that this
  sympathy is the same quality which helps him in getting into touch with
  fairies. His account of the latter is extraordinarily interesting.</p>

  <p>"I should describe them as being between two and three feet in height,"
  says he, "and dressed in brown clothes. The nearest approach I can get to
  them is to say that they are 'spiritual monkeys.' Their general instinct is
  to avoid mankind, but they are capable individually of becoming extremely
  fond of humans&mdash;or of <i>a</i> human. They are just Peter Pans, children
  who have never grown up. Speaking generally I should imagine that anyone who
  has had any truck with the fairies must have obeyed the scriptural injunction
  to 'become as a little child '&mdash;i.e. he or she must be either a Buddha
  or simple."</p>

  <p>Another friend of mine who claimed to have the power of seeing fairies is
  the late Tom Tyrrell, the famous medium, whose clairvoyance and general
  psychic gifts were of the strongest character. I cannot easily forget how one
  evening in a Yorkshire hotel a storm of raps, sounding very much as if
  someone was cracking their finger and thumb, broke out around his head, and
  how with his coffee-cup in one hand, he flapped vigorously with the other to
  warn off his inopportune visitors. In answer to my question about fairies, he
  says:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do see these little pixies or fairies. I have seen them scores of
  times. But only in the woods and when I do a little fasting. They are a very
  real presence to me. What are they? I cannot say. I can never get nearer to
  the beggars than four or five yards. They seem afraid of me, and they scamper
  off up the trees like squirrels. I dare say if I were to go in the woods
  oftener I would perhaps gain their confidence more. They are certainly like
  human beings only very small, say about twelve or fifteen inches high. I have
  noticed they are brown in colour, with fairly large heads and standing up
  ears, out of proportion to the size of their bodies, and bandy legs. I am
  speaking of what I see. I have never come across any other clairvoyant who
  has seen them, though I have read that many do so. Probably they have
  something to do with Nature processes. The males have very short hair, and
  the females rather long, straight hair."</p>

  <p>The idea that these little creatures are occupied in consciously
  furthering Nature's projects&mdash;very much, I suppose, as the bee carries
  pollen&mdash;is repeated by the learned Dr. Vanstone, who combines great
  knowledge of theory with some considerable experience, though a high
  development of intellect, is, in spite of Swedenborg's example, a bar to
  psychic perception. This would show, if it is correct, that we may have to
  return to the classical conceptions of something in the nature of naiads and
  fauns and spirits of the trees and groves. Dr. Vanstone, whose experiences
  are on the borderland between what is objective and what is sensed without
  being actually seen, writes to me:</p>

  <p>"I have been distinctly aware of minute intelligent beings in connection
  with the evolution of plant forces, particularly in certain localities, for
  instance in Ecclesbourne Glen. Pond life yields to me the largest and best
  sense of fairy life, and not the floral world. I may be only clothing my
  subjective consciousness with unreal objective imaginations, but they are
  real to me as sentient intelligent beings, able to communicate with us in
  varying distinctness. I am inclined to think that elemental beings are
  engaged, like factory hands, in facilitating the operation of Nature's
  laws."</p>

  <p>Another gentleman who claims to have this most remarkable gift is Mr. Tom
  Charman, in the New Forest, who hunts for fairies as an entomologist would
  for butterflies. In answer to my inquiries he tells me that the power of
  vision came to him in childhood, but left him for many years, varying in
  proportion with his own nearness to nature. According to this seer the
  creatures are of many sizes, varying from a few inches to several feet. They
  are male, female, and children. He has not heard them utter sounds but
  believes that they do so of finer quality than we can hear. They are visible
  by night as well as by day, and show small lights about the same size as
  glowworms. They dress in all sorts of ways. Such is Mr. Charman's
  account.</p>

  <p>It is easy, of course, for us who only respond to the more material
  vibrations, to declare that all these seers are self-deluded or are the
  victims of some mental twist. It is difficult for them to defend themselves
  from such a charge. It is, however, to be urged upon the other side that
  these numerous testimonies come from people who are very solid, practical and
  successful in the affairs of life. One is a distinguished writer, another an
  ophthalmic authority, a third a successful professional man, a fourth a lady
  engaged on public service, and so on. To wave aside the evidence of such
  people on the ground that it does not correspond with our own experience, is
  an act of mental arrogance which no wise man will commit.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to compare these various contemporary first-hand
  accounts of the impressions which all these witnesses have received. I have
  already pointed out that the higher vibration which we associate with hot
  sunshine, and which we actually seem to see in the shimmer of noontide, is
  associated with many of the episodes. Apart from this is must be admitted
  that the evidence is on the whole irregular. We have creatures described
  which range from five inches to two and a half feet An advocate of the
  fairies might say that since the tradition has always been that they
  procreate as human beings do, we are dealing with them in every stage of
  growth, which accounts for the varying size. It seems to me, however, that a
  better case could be made out if it were pleaded that there have always been
  many different races of fairyland, and that samples of these races may
  greatly differ from each other, and may inhabit varying spots, so that an
  observer like Mr. Tyrrell for example, may always have seen woodland elves
  which bear no resemblance to gnomes or goblins. The monkey-like brown-clad
  creatures of my professional friend, which were over two feet high, compare
  very closely with the creatures which little Baring- Gould saw climbing on to
  the horses. In both cases these taller fairies were reported from flat
  plain-like locations, while the little old man type varies completely from
  the dancing little feminine elf so beloved by Shakespeare. In the experience
  of Mr. Turvey and Mr. Lonsdale two different types engaged in different tasks
  were actually seen at the same moment, the one being bright- coloured dancing
  elves, while the other were the brown-coloured attendants who guarded over
  them.</p>

  <p>The claim that the fairy rings so often seen in meadow or marshland are
  caused by the beat of fairy feet is certainly untenable, as they
  unquestionably come from fungi such as <i>agaricus gambosus</i> or
  <i>marasmius oveades</i> which grow from a centre, continually deserting the
  exhausted ground and spreading to that which is fresh. In this way a complete
  circle is formed which may be quite small or may be of twelve-foot diameter.
  These circles appear just as often in woods from the same cause but are
  smothered over by the decayed leaves among which the fungi grow. But though
  the fairies most certainly do not produce the rings it might be asserted, and
  could not be denied, that the rings once formed, whatever their cause, would
  offer a very charming course for a circular ring-a-ring dance. Certainly from
  all time these circles have been associated with the gambols of the little
  people.</p>

  <p>After these modern instances one is inclined to read with a little more
  gravity the accounts which our ancestors gave of these creatures, for however
  fanciful in parts it still may have had some core of truth. I say "our
  ancestors," but as a matter of fact there are shepherds on the South Downs to
  this day who will throw a bit of their bread and cheese over their shoulders
  at dinner-time for the little folk to consume. All over the United Kingdom,
  and especially in Wales and in Ireland, the belief is largely held among
  those folk who are nearest to nature. First of all it was always supposed
  that they lived within the earth. This was natural enough since a sudden
  disappearance of a solid body could only be understood in that way. On the
  whole their description was not grotesque, and fits easily into its place
  amid the examples already given.</p>

  <p>One of the best of the ancient accounts is that of the Rev. R. Kirk who
  occupied a parish at Monteith on the edge of the Highlands, and wrote a
  pamphlet called <i>The Secret Commonwealth</i> about the year 1680. He had
  very clear and definite ideas about these little creatures, and he was by no
  means a visionary but a man of considerable parts, who was chosen afterwards
  to translate the Bible into Erse. His information about fairies tallies very
  well with that already quoted. He slips up in imagining that flint arrowheads
  are indeed "fairy-bolts," but otherwise his contentions agree very well with
  our modern instances. They have tribes and orders, according to this Scotch
  clergyman. They eat. They converse in a thin whistling sort of language. They
  have children, deaths and burials. They are fond of frolic-dancing. They have
  a regular state and polity with rulers, laws, quarrels and even battles. They
  are irresponsible creatures, not hostile to the human race unless they have
  reason to be angry, but even inclined to be helpful, since some of them, the
  Brownies, are by universal tradition, ready to aid in the household work if
  the family has known how to engage their affection.</p>

  <p>An exactly similar account comes from Ireland, though the little folk seem
  to have imbibed the spirit of the island to the extent of being more
  mercurial and irascible. There are many cases on record where they are
  claimed to have shown their power and to have taken revenge for some slight.
  In the <i>Larne Reporter</i> of March 31,1866, as quoted in <i>True Irish
  Ghost Stories</i>, there is an account of how a stone which the fairies
  claimed having been built into a house, the inhabitants were bombarded with
  stones by invisible assailants by day and night, the missiles hurting no one
  but causing great annoyance. These stories of stone-throwing are so common,
  and present such similar well-attested features in cases coming from every
  part of the world, that they may be accepted as a recognized preternatural
  phenomenon, whether it be the fairies or some other form of mischievous
  psychic force which cause the bombardment. The volume already quoted gives
  another remarkable case where a farmer having built a house upon what was
  really a fairy right of way between two "raths" or fairy mounds, was exposed
  to such persecution by noises and other disturbances that his family was at
  last driven out and had to take refuge in the smaller house which they had
  previously occupied. This story is narrated by a correspondent from Wexford,
  who says that he examined the facts himself, examined the deserted house,
  cross-examined the owner and satisfied himself that there were two raths in
  the vicinity and that the house was in a dead-line between them.</p>

  <p>I have particulars of a case in West Sussex which is analogous, and which
  I have been able to trace to the very lady to whom it happened. This lady
  desired to make a rock garden, and for this purpose got some large boulders
  from a field hard by, which had always been known as the pixie stones and
  built them into her new rockery. One summer evening this lady saw a tiny grey
  woman sitting on one of the boulders. The little creature slipped away when
  she knew that she had been observed. Several times she appeared upon the
  stones. Later the people in the village asked if the stones might be moved
  back to the field, "as," they said, "they are the pixie stones and if they
  are moved from their place misfortune will happen in the village." The stones
  were restored.</p>

  <p>But supposing that they actually do exist what <i>are</i> these creatures?
  That is a subject upon which we can only speculate with more or less
  plausibility. Mr. David Gow, Editor of <i>Light</i> and a considerable
  authority upon psychic matters, had first formed the opinion that they were
  simply ordinary human spirits seen, as it were, at the wrong end of a
  clairvoyant telescope, and therefore very minute. A study of the detailed
  accounts of their varied experience caused him to alter his view and to
  conclude that they are really life forms which have developed along some
  separate line of evolution, and which for some morphological reason have
  assumed human shape in the strange way in which Nature reproduces her types
  like the figures on the mandrake root, or the frost ferns upon the
  window.</p>

  <p>In a remarkable book, <i>A Wanderer in the Spirit Lands,</i> published in
  1896, the author, Mr. Farnese, under inspiration, gives an account of many
  mysteries including that of fairies. What he says fits in very clearly with
  the facts that have been put forward, and goes beyond them. He says, speaking
  of elementals,</p>

  <p>"Some are in appearance like the gnomes and elves who are said to inhabit
  mountain caverns. Such, too, are the fairies whom men have seen in lonely and
  secluded places. Some of these beings are of a very low order of life, almost
  like the higher order of plants, save that they possess independent motion.
  Others are very lively and full of grotesque unmeaning tricks... As nations
  advance these lower forms of life die out from the astral plane of that
  earth's sphere and succeeding generations begin at first to doubt and then to
  deny that they ever had any existence."</p>

  <p>This is one plausible way of explaining the disappearance of the faun, the
  dryad, the naiad, and all the creatures which are alluded to with such
  familiarity in the classics of Greece and Rome.</p>

  <p>All these evidences as to fairies sink into insignificance compared with
  the actual photographs which I have published in my <i>Coming of the
  Fairies.</i> These, in the enlarged edition, cover cases from Yorkshire,
  Devonshire, Canada and Germany, and show varying sizes as already described.
  Since its publication I have had an excellent one from Sweden. They are not
  all supported by the same degree of evidence, but each case is strong and all
  the cases taken together seem to me to be final, unless we are to reconsider
  altogether our views as to the nature and power of thought-forms. No
  criticism has for a moment shaken the truth of the original Cottingley
  pictures. All fresh evidence has tended to confirm it. I refer readers to the
  book for the full detail, and for the pictures themselves.</p>

  <p>Some final paragraphs may be devoted to other forms of elemental life for
  which there is some evidence, though I admit that it is on a very different
  level from that which sustains the fairies. In Mrs. Tweedale's <i>Ghosts I
  have seen</i>, a book which is far more thrilling than any sensational novel,
  and which can only be matched by the companion volume, <i>Phantoms of the
  Dawn</i>, will be found several descriptions of fauns, satyrs, and even in
  one case of a troop of centaurs, which are picturesque and arresting, if not
  entirely convincing. I know Mrs. Tweedale personally&mdash;she is the
  daughter of one of the famous Chambers brothers of Edinburgh, and I am aware
  that she is the last woman in the world to exaggerate or trifle with truth.
  The more remarkable of these elemental stories, however, are given
  second-hand, so that she cannot be responsible.</p>

  <p>There is one curious case which fits into the idea of a satyr-like
  creature who had by some mischance wandered out of his own vibration and got
  entangled in matter. I do not venture to say that this is the actual
  explanation, but I do maintain that the facts appear to be well-attested and
  that I know no other solution which would fully cover them. They are to be
  found in a book called <i>Oddities</i> published some years ago. It is there
  shown that on a certain year in the middle of last century, after a slight
  snow- shower, footprints of cleft goat-like feet which were most carefully
  observed, measured, and even photographed, were found over a hundred miles of
  ground in Devonshire. These footsteps had apparently all been made in the one
  night, and extended right across country over all obstacles, including the
  Teignmouth estuary, where the marks vanished at one side and re-appeared at
  the other. They were&mdash;I quote from memory &mdash;about two inches by one
  in size. If the facts are correctly given, then an elaborate practical joke
  carried out by a number of people acting in collusion would be the only
  alternative to the preternatural one, which I have ventured not to maintain
  but to suggest as a remote possibility. The case attracted much attention at
  the time and tracings of the prints are to be found in an old number of the
  <i>Illustrated London News</i>.</p>

  <p>One may well ask what connection have fairies and elementals with the
  essays upon the fate of the human soul which have formed most of this series?
  The connection is slight and indirect, consisting only in the fact that
  anything which widens our conceptions of the possible, and shakes us out of
  our time-rutted lines of thought, helps us to regain our elasticity of mind
  and thus to be more open to new philosophies. The fairy question is
  infinitely small and unimportant compared to the question of our own fate and
  that of the whole human race. The evidence also is very much less impressive
  though, as I trust I have shown, it is not entirely negligible. These
  creatures are in any case remote from us and their existence is of little
  more real importance than that of strange animals or plants. At the same time
  the perennial mystery, why so many "flowers are born to blush unseen" and why
  Nature should be so lavish with gifts which human beings cannot use, would be
  solved if we understood that there were other orders of being which used the
  same earth and shared its blessings. It is at the lowest an interesting
  speculation which gives an added charm to the silence of the woods and the
  wildness of the moorland.</p><br>

  <p class="first">When one finds that a philsophy is obscure, and when one
  fails after an earnest effort to get it clear, one may usually conclude that
  the teacher is also obscure and that the subject has not been clearly thought
  out. For some time I have endeavoured to get an understanding of Thomas Lake
  Harris, a mystic about whom there has been the utmost difference of opinion
  ranging from the Messianic to the diabolical. In my search for truth I have
  read much that he has written and I have carefully perused his <i>Life and
  World Work</i>, by a devoted follower, Mr. Arthur Cuthbert, who claims to
  have shared some of the same psychic experiences. I have also studied
  <i>Sympneumata</i>, written by Mrs. Laurence Oliphant and edited by her
  famous husband. Instead of clearing up obscurities this leaves them more
  obscure than ever. One earnestly wishes that the husband had expounded the
  matter, since he could write English, instead of the wife with her
  interminable and involved sentences which average about two to a page.
  Finally I read the picture of Harris taken by the novelist, Mrs. Oliphant,
  who was Laurence's aunt, and who takes a very severe view of the American
  prophet. At the end of it all I find myself in the same perplexity as ever,
  and have no sure idea whether I am dealing with a megalomaniac ranter endowed
  with considerable worldly cunning, or with one who really had a breath of the
  divine afflatus&mdash;whether in fact his philosophy was a cloud of words or
  whether he had an authentic message.</p>

  <p>I am consoled in my indecision, and reassured as to my own judgment when I
  clearly see that the astute Laurence Oliphant, after twelve years of most
  intimate association, cannot answer for the real character of his associate.
  His famous pen-drawing of him in <i>Masollam</i> pictures a dual personality
  with two voices and two ranges of vision, and it ends with the words, "He
  might be the best or the worst of men." A short sketch of my impressions of
  this curious man and of his doctrines may be of interest to readers.</p>

  <p>Harris was born in Fenny Stratford in Buckinghamshire in 1823, and was
  five years old when his parents emigrated to the United States, settling in
  Utica in the north of the State of New York. This region seems to have been
  to an extraordinary degree the centre of new religions or pseudo-religious
  impulses from that time onwards. Spiritualism, Mormonism, and, as I believe,
  Christian Science all had their original springs in this geographical centre.
  Harris, who was independent of each of these movements, was destined to make
  a very definite contribution of his own to the general spiritual urge and
  outreach which was characteristic of the time and place.</p>

  <p>His people were narrow Calvinistic Baptists, and at an early age Harris
  rebelled against their sour doctrines and accepted the wider and more
  charitable teaching of the Universalists. An officer has told me how upon his
  inquiring into the religion of a recruit the Sergeant answered, "'E calls
  'imself a Christadelphian, but to my mind 'e's little better than a 'eathen."
  Probably this was the view taken of the Universalists in those days of dogma.
  It was the nature of Harris to reject all dogmas, until he came to put
  forward some of his own. He was twenty years of age when he changed his
  religion, and he has left it on record that his dead mother appeared to him
  at that time and said, "My dear child, my poor child, you must all remember
  that God is the father of all men and that all mankind are your
  brothers."</p>

  <p>He seems to have been a most eloquent preacher and soon won a considerable
  name, but the rather vague tenets of his new creed made him crave for
  something in the nature of concrete proof. Some chance of this was offered at
  this period by the use of Spiritualism, and in order to get clearer views
  upon the subject Harris paid a visit to Andrew Jackson Davis, who after some
  experiences as a hypnotic subject had finally become an inspired medium. The
  meeting and intercourse of these two men was certainly a notable event, for
  in their different ways they were both remarkable characters, and each has a
  niche of his own in religious history. Harris was twenty-four at the time and
  Davis twenty, two most singular youths. Davis converted Harris to the idea of
  spirit intercourse and for some years Harris was an enthusiastic preacher and
  leader. Davis, however, had some peculiar amatory adventures, depicted in his
  <i>Magic Staff</i>, and Harris, who professed a deeper regard for the
  marriage vow, was disillusioned and turned as violent an opponent as he had
  been a friend of the Spiritualistic movement. His attitude seems to have been
  supremely illogical, for the ill-doings, granting that they exist, of any
  member of a philosophy cannot alter the facts upon which the philosophy is
  founded. It would be as reasonable for an inquirer to discard Christianity in
  order to show disapproval of Judas. The fact remains, however, that Harris
  was seen no more on Spiritualistic platforms and that his voice was raised
  against all that he had supported. To anyone who is acquainted with the true
  tenets of this cult it must be obvious that he had never grasped their
  meaning and seemed to consider that an artificial hypnotism was essential to
  mediumship. His objections are mostly founded upon the supposition that one
  comes in contact with evil spirits. One may find plenty of evil spirits in
  the flesh, but one chooses one's company and one finds that it is not
  difficult to come into contact with the higher ones as well. This great fact
  Harris ignored and from that moment his life took a turn of its own, and he
  lost touch with any philosophy which is capable of clear expression, though
  it influenced strongly a small circle of followers.</p>

  <p>He still ministered to a considerable church in New York, the congregation
  of which, including Horace Greeley, must have been sorely exercised in
  endeavouring to keep pace with, or to understand, the spiritual gyrations of
  their pastor. It was called the Independent Christian Church and was still on
  universalist lines. He narrates that addresses which he delivered there came
  to him by what Spiritualists now call automatic writing, and that the purpose
  and ultimate effect of them was the redemption of destitute children &mdash;
  an admission which one would have supposed must modify his condemnation of
  spirit intercourse. At this period he was one of those who founded a colony
  called the Mountain Cave Association, which was dissolved after a short and
  not too honourable existence. It was this first experiment in communal life
  which no doubt suggested the larger developments to come.</p>

  <p>It was at this time, about 1850, that Harris received according to his own
  account a direct revelation from a majestic angel man who turned his thoughts
  into a special channel. This tale of the direct apparition occurs in
  Swedenborg's first vision, in Smith's revelation of Mormonism, and in Davis's
  account of his experience in the hills near Poughkeepsie. Considering the
  recent close association with the latter seer, it is not entirely impossible
  that Harris's vision may have been subconsciously suggested by what he had
  heard of the apparition seen by Davis. The first fruits of the new departure
  were a long poem of 6,000 lines which was completed in the extraordinary time
  of twenty-seven working hours, scattered over fourteen days. It may be said
  once for all that Harris in this and many subsequent poems, which were so
  copious that it is doubtful if any writer has ever composed so much, showed
  himself to be a true poet of a high order. Lawrence Oliphant put him at the
  very top, and without being able to go so far as that, I should say that he
  stood very high. There are times when in his strong simplicity of phrase he
  reminds one of Blake, and there are times when his high spirituality touches
  the edge of Shelley. As an example of the former I would take:</p>

  <p>"Nine months I lay in a Lady's womb, She folded me all in her laughing
  bloom, She hallowed me while I filled and fed From the nectar-wells of her
  mother-head."</p>

  <p>As to the latter almost any page from his longer poems would illustrate my
  meaning.</p>

  <p>Lyrical speech seems to have been his natural expression, which accounts
  for a certain rhythm and majesty in his addresses. A lady who knew him at
  that period wrote of him:</p>

  <p>"When in Utica he would come to my sitting-room of an evening and sitting
  down on a rather high chair&mdash;one which allowed him to swing his feet
  rhythmically, he would compose poetry by the mile&mdash;exquisite thoughts,
  exquisitely worded. My memories of those quiet hours are very beautiful.
  There was nothing impressive about his person then; he was too thin, really
  lank, but his eyes were very full of thought and his voice had a rare charm.
  His poetic utterances were to me like views of sunset and sunrise, which we
  enjoy internally but which we cannot remember."</p>

  <p>This last sentence seems to me to be very good criticism, well observed
  and clearly expressed. The reason seems to be that it is all too
  transcendental and ethereal. When Tennyson discusses the deeper things of
  life there are constant touches which bring one back to human experience.
  Harris is off the ground all the time. There is no anchor by which one may
  attach him to the current life of man. Hence one reads, as the lady says,
  with admiration for the limpid verse and the lofty thought, and yet at the
  end there is little which has remained as part of one's own mental
  storehouse.</p>

  <p>And now the time had come when Harris had to strike out a path of his own
  into the unknown, and a very vague and difficult path it is for anyone else
  to indicate&mdash;far less to follow. There is an objective side to it and
  there is a theoretical or dogmatic side. The objective side of this system
  lay in the assertion that by some system of breathing certain psychic results
  may be obtained, and the mind elucidated as to things divine. It is to be
  presupposed that such exercises of the diaphragm or solar plexus&mdash;for
  those are indicated as being physically involved&mdash;are concomitant with
  mental and spiritual efforts, otherwise the matter would be no more a sign of
  progress than results to be obtained by standing upon one's head. On the
  other hand, one would suppose that if the mental and spiritual effort had
  been made the advance would be automatic and independent of physical
  exertions. However, the theory is as I have stated, and there are found other
  witnesses, such as Mr. Cuthbert, who assert that they have themselves gone
  through the early stages of illumination as produced in this fashion. There
  are said to be seven stages in this advance by breath, each of them to be
  obtained by long and apparently painful effort. No one save Harris himself
  had ever attained the seventh, though all his followers, including his
  successive wives, three in number, were on various rungs of the ladder. The
  fact that Harris himself was supposed to have passed through the whole seven
  degrees was the basis for claims which must startle if not convince the
  general public, since it was seriously stated that the Christ was the only
  person who had ever done so much. The process, however, seems to have escaped
  the notice of the apostles, since it is mentioned in no gospel, and Paul, who
  gave so full a list of the spiritual gifts, has said nothing on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>At the same time it is not to be denied that there is a considerable body
  of evidence that by a certain control of the breath some exalted mental
  condition can be obtained. In Swedenborg's case the more shallow his
  breathing the more spiritual his frame of mind. Cataleptics appear not to
  breathe at all, and are from time to time buried alive in consequence, but
  the condition seems to go with remarkable enfranchisement of the spirit. The
  Hindoos have reduced it to a system and claim similar results. I can remember
  in Canterbury, New Zealand, meeting some people who practised it, and who
  assured me that it was not without danger, as the excursion of the soul
  leaves an empty house behind, which may attract a parasitic tenant. However
  that may be, Harris's general claim meets with some support, though I know no
  proof that any high spirituality is necessarily associated with what would
  rather seem to be a curious physiological experiment. This breathing
  phenomenon is, so far as I know, the only objective part of Harris's
  philosophy.</p>

  <p>We come, therefore, to its dogmatic side, which consists in the assertion
  of the dual sex in every-one, including the Creator. Bi-une is the word which
  covers the philosophy. So far is it pushed that even a name is given to this
  second personality, so that the Lady Jessa is associated with the Lord Jesus,
  and Harris himself is closely intertwined with the Lady Lily to the not
  unnatural confusion of his earthly wives. So high is the Lady Lily that the
  whole celestial region after death is named Lilistan. This dual internal
  mating is supposed to do away with the coarser processes of nature and to
  free mankind from the lustful morass in which he is accused of wallowing, but
  as Harris had not only wives but also children, it would appear that the
  higher path was not all-sufficing.</p>

  <p>In that most incomprehensible book <i>Sympneumata</i>, which might well be
  translated into English, there is a disquisition upon the bi-une gods of old,
  in which Isis and Osiris, Hathor and Ra, Bel and Bilit, with many others are
  duly paired. Considering the practical results of these old systems one would
  think that their teachings are rather to be avoided than followed. What is to
  be gained, or how would human life be elevated by our following
  hermaphroditic divinities? So far as the case is applicable to human beings
  it has, of course, that amount of obvious truth that a man does reproduce
  many of the qualities of his mother, and a girl may do the same by the
  father, and so each sex may manifest its presence in the composite result.
  There are also anatomical facts which correspond with the psychological
  unison. But when this is said one cannot see that much remains. The
  discussion of sex in connection with the Deity seems incongruous and
  repulsive, nor does Harris ever give any clear reason why such strange dogmas
  should be given to a world which is already sick of unproved assertions and
  struggling hard to escape from wild faiths into a region of concrete proof.
  Had Harris ever really understood Spiritualism he would have realized that
  this concrete proof for which the whole intellect of the human race is
  yearning, may well be found in that direction.</p>

  <p>There were some other peculiar beliefs in the Harris cosmogony. One was
  that the planets were inhabited by spirits, some superior and some inferior
  to those upon earth. There was a reaction between these beings and ourselves.
  Another was that fairies, or as he preferred to call them, fays, played a
  very important part in the development of man's spirit. That such creatures
  exist and that they play some lowly part in nature is held by many and is
  supported by evidence which will bear examination, but for the ambitious
  spiritual role here assigned to them there is no evidence at all, unless we
  extend the term "fay" to include those higher entities or angels who may
  reasonably be supposed to have some guiding influence in our lives.</p>

  <p>Apart from obscure doctrines there was one side of the Harris system with
  which many of us would cordially agree. It was that we would do well to get
  back to the simple life. He founded successive communities for this alleged
  purpose, and the system adopted was called "The Use." The first colony was
  assembled in a farm-house at Wassiac in 1861. In 1863 it moved to America,
  where it centred round a mill and a bank. In the latter institution Mr.
  Harris, the president, is depicted as spending much of his time. "Here the
  people come on business together and others would sit down and smoke and talk
  over their affairs and general politics, while the President himself would be
  frequently occupying one of the chairs in the midst of them and entering into
  full sympathy with them in a perfectly natural, ordinary, neighbourly
  fashion." It is a pleasant picture which Mr. Cuthbert draws, but somehow one
  wishes it was not a bank.</p>

  <p>Just about this time a most amazing thing happened. The prophet had gone
  with his wife to England for the purpose of securing the publication of some
  of his works. While there he gave some lectures or sermons at the Steinway
  Hall. His ornate and rather inflated style of eloquence, which like his
  poetry is limpid and vaguely beautiful, attracted audiences, among whom was
  Lady Oliphant, the mother of the famous writer and diplomatist, one of the
  most rising men in England.</p>

  <p>She brought her son to hear the further lectures, and the views of the
  prophet struck some sympathetic mystic chord in their own bosoms. The idea of
  the simple community life with its dreamy religious background appealed
  strongly to natures which were weary of the empty ways of fashion and
  unsatisfied by the unreasonable dogmas of the churches. They liquidated their
  business affairs, left their homes and threw in their lot with the American
  community. This access of fresh strength and money enabled the colonists to
  move to Brocton near Buffalo, where some large farms were taken and the whole
  project took on a more ambitious aspect.</p>

  <p>Those who wish to see a critical and adverse view of the matter will find
  it in Mrs. Oliphant's life of her famous nephew. One can well understand that
  it was galling to the pride of a grand old Scottish family that their finest
  product should come under the complete sway of what seemed to them to be a
  very dubious American adventurer. How complete that sway was may be judged
  from the fact that the next ten or twelve years of Laurence Oliphant's life
  were spent in menial agricultural tasks, which included the selling of
  strawberries at the railway station to the passengers in the trains. There
  is, we must admit, something of beauty and of sanctity in this utilitarian
  age, that a man should humble himself for spiritual ends, and yet when one
  considers the exceptional gifts with which this particular man had been
  endowed, one doubts whether anything could excuse the diversion of his
  energies into a channel so useless to the world. Such was the complete
  subservience of the young Scot that he had with difficulty to get leave of
  absence from Brocton in order to act as war correspondent in the
  Franco-German war. Even more incredible, he had to ask leave to marry, and
  after the marriage was separated for a long time from his wife by orders of
  the autocratic prophet. It is amazing how any man of spirit could submit to
  such a position, and no adequate explanation of it has ever been given. It
  would seem that Harris held a fairly substantial hostage for Oliphant's
  behaviour in the fact that a large part of the latter's fortune was locked up
  in the Brocton property, which, however, was not held in the name of Harris
  but in that of the community at large. Oliphant was not the only person of
  distinction in the little company, for there were several Japanese who had
  come presumably on his recommendation, as he had made many friends in that
  nation during his diplomatic visit to their country. One of these Japanese
  afterwards became Ambassador at London and a second Ambassador at Paris, so
  that either the personality or the teaching of Harris must have had some very
  real attraction for intelligent followers.</p>

  <p>The prophet, in spite of his seven stages of breathing and the agonies of
  spirit or of body which those stages represented, seems to have had a very
  human side in his complex personality. He enjoyed the good things of life,
  including a cigar and a glass of wine, while the heartiness of his laughter
  was proverbial. He had an excellent head for commercial affairs and he built
  a second bank, an hotel, a general store, a railway restaurant, and many
  other amenities in connection with his colony. Finally, finding a larger and
  more profitable field available, he started a considerable vineyard at
  Fountain Grove in the extreme south of California, which no doubt still
  produces the raisins by which so many private stills mitigate the austerities
  of Prohibition. One would have a fuller sympathy with these activities if
  they were not mixed up with strange religious jargon, so that it was actually
  claimed that the wine from the vineyards contained within it "a
  divine-natural vital substance."</p>

  <p>In the midst of his worldly work Harris found time to write a great deal
  both of verse and of prose. Of the former I have already given my opinion. I
  cannot speak so favourably of the prose. Mr. Cuthbert in his <i>Life and
  Work</i> devotes some seventy pages to quotations from what he calls "this
  great book," which was afterwards published as <i>The New Republic</i> and
  <i>God's Breath in Man</i>. There may be an esoteric meaning to it all which
  gives it a special value to his followers, but on the face of it to an
  ordinary critic it would appear to be turgid stuff with no trace of
  greatness, and with a considerable tendency to both blasphemy and obscenity.
  I will confess that I am influenced in my judgment of Harris by this work,
  and that after reading it I cannot doubt that the man who wrote it had at
  that time an utterly unbalanced mind, and that as a guide he could only lead
  one to disaster. The man's life was many-sided, however, and, as I have tried
  to show, there were other aspects of it and other literary productions which
  were less open to criticism.</p>

  <p>The Laurence Oliphant episode came to an end after some twelve years of
  subjection. There is no record how the rift began, but both the writer and
  his mother had gradually become disillusioned. It can hardly be imagined that
  such writings as those alluded to above could fail to repel educated and
  sensitive minds. They may have found the worldly and successful prophet a
  very different person to the spiritual enthusiast who had originally led them
  into the wilderness. The parting was by no means friendly. Oliphant took
  legal processes in order to recover some portion of his property, while
  Harris in return tried to put Oliphant into a lunatic asylum. Eventually some
  part of the money was recovered, and Oliphant moved away on his curious
  orbit, winding up at El Harja in Syria, where he spent his latter years. The
  fact that he allowed his wife to publish <i>Sympneumata</i> and that the book
  is adorned by many scraps of verse which, though unacknowledged by the
  authoress, are clearly from the pen of Harris, show that in some respects his
  views about the prophet had not been changed.</p>

  <p>There is little more to record of Harris, who dwelt for the most part on
  his Californian estate, save that in his seventieth year he announced that he
  had passed his final stage of breathing, and had thus reached what was
  claimed to be a unique position among mankind. He announced the event in the
  <i>Sonoma Democrat</i>, and his statement is more definite than most of the
  cloud of words which obscure the subject. He wrote:</p>

  <p>"For the last two or three years I have been secluded most of the time in
  my mountain retreat, working to the final solutions of the problems that
  opened in my discoveries of forty years ago. The final problem that faced me
  during these years was ... how, without passing through physical disease,
  shall man practically embody and realize the resurrection... The alternative
  was success or dissolution. Success came as suddenly and pleasantly as when a
  deep-laden, storm-tossed ship glides over the harbour-bar from the raging
  outside sea and swings at ease in a landlocked haven. I have passed through
  December. I am in May-time... No more an old man of over seventy but now
  renewed in more than the physical and mental powers of the early prime, my
  retirement is at an end... I leave the disposition of my honour to the slow
  but finally just unveilings of coming time. Each hour of my days must be
  devoted to labour of necessity and beneficence."</p>

  <p>These brave words should have been the cry of the centenarian. It was not
  destined to be. It was not, however, until he had reached the ripe but not
  extraordinary age of eighty-three that Thomas Lake Harris took leave of his
  Californian vineyard and journeyed on to Lilistan or whatever other sphere of
  the coming world he had earned by his strange mixed career. He has certainly
  left behind him one of the most curious personal and religious problems with
  which I am acquainted.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">A LONDON GHOST</a></h2>

  <h3>No magazine publication located<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">For some days the papers had contained accounts of a haunted
  house within a few hundred yards of Piccadilly Circus, which had aroused the
  interest of the public.</p>

  <p>The allegations, founded on the actual experiences of residents, were,
  that in the lower room of this building there was a perceptible and evil
  psychic atmosphere, that raps were heard, that a luminous ray was seen on the
  stair, and that a figure of an elderly man with an evil face had several
  times been seen by a young woman who was employed professionally on the
  premises.</p>

  <p>It was to test this matter that a few of us assembled on the night of May
  28th, 1924, reaching the house at eleven o'clock. It was in the theatre
  neighbourhood, and it was a curious change from the streets, which were
  crowded with the returning pleasure-seekers, to the absolute silence of the
  sinister old house which stands in a by-street.</p>

  <p>Our party consisted of the young woman already quoted, whom I will call
  the clairvoyante, the secretary of the business, a young Dutch artist who
  claimed also to have psychic vision, Mr. Horace Leaf, who is a strong medium,
  a Wimpole Street physician, the Rev. Vale Owen, and myself.</p>

  <p>As I had organized the expedition I took it on myself to guard the party
  against practical jokers. All doors were locked and a piece of twine was tied
  across the only staircase which led down to the lower room.</p>

  <p>In this lower room we assembled, and at 11.30, having grouped ourselves
  round a table so that we might be in a position to obtain table messages, we
  turned out the lights. No sound at all reached us from the street, and we sat
  quietly awaiting events, chatting occasionally among ourselves, as experience
  has shown that sound vibrations are helpful in psychic phenomena.</p>

  <p>At first the darkness had seemed absolute. Gradually, however, we were
  able to discern a dim light on the stair. It had a spectral effect, but we
  were all in agreement that it was caused by a reflection from the glass roof
  of the building, and that it was our own vision, growing gradually used to
  the conditions, which had caused it to develop.</p>

  <p>We were not aware of any particular psychic atmosphere. There were a few
  distant taps, or cracks, but not more than is usual in an old house in the
  silence of the night-time.</p>

  <p>Our hands were all on the table, which occasionally thrilled and shook,
  but gave no pronounced movement. We had begun to think that our results might
  be entirely negative when the clairvoyante on my left whispered in an
  agitated voice:</p>

  <p>"I see him. He is there. He is standing on the stair looking down at
  us."</p>

  <p>"An elderly man, bearded, with rather slit eyes and a cunning expression,"
  was her description of the apparition. It was corroborated by the Dutchman. I
  could see the faint luminosity which marked the line of the stairs, but
  nothing more.</p>

  <p>I do not, however, possess any psychic perceptions. The two seers reported
  that the man had descended a little, and the clairvoyante showed signs of
  considerable emotion.</p>

  <p>We spoke, begging the unseen figure to approach us and to tell us how we
  could assist it. A moment later the two seers agreed that it was no longer on
  the stair.</p>

  <p>In a minute the table began to move. It rose and fell in a steady rhythm.
  My experience of table-sittings, which is a large one, has shown me that
  undeveloped spirits always make violent and irregular&mdash;often circular
  &mdash;movements, and that steady movement is a sign of a deliberate,
  thoughtful control.</p>

  <p>We were reassured, therefore, as regards the nature of our invisible
  visitant. Having explained the code, the dialogue between us ran thus, the
  answers coming clear-cut and swift.</p>

  <p>"Are you a spirit?"&mdash;"Yes"</p>

  <p>"A man?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Are you the spirit who has haunted this room?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Have you a reason for haunting it?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Is it money that troubles you?"&mdash;"No."</p>

  <p>"Papers?"&mdash;"No."</p>

  <p>"Remorse for deeds done?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>I then explained to the spirit the conditions under which he lived, and
  the need to turn his thoughts away from worldly matters, which retarded
  spiritual progress. I begged him to cease to annoy innocent people, and I
  told him that he could only work out his own salvation by adapting his mind
  to the new conditions, by being unselfish, and by striving for higher
  things.</p>

  <p>I said that we would pray for him, and Mr. Vale Owen, there and then,
  offered up a beautiful prayer that this, our unhappy brother, might be eased
  and helped. I then asked if he had heard and understood.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

  <p>Had it affected his attitude of mind? Some hesitation, and then "No."
  Clearly he was a man of resolute character, not easily to be influenced.</p>

  <p>I then said that we would take any message from him, and would like first
  of all to know his earth name. With that object I gave him the alphabet
  slowly, asking him to move the table sharply on the right letter. The
  following letters came out: L-E-N-A-N.</p>

  <p>"Is that right?" I asked.&mdash;"No," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Is L E N right?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Should the next letter be I?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Is Lenin the name?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Are you Lenin the Russian leader?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>All our company protested that this man's name was not in the minds of
  anyone. Certainly it was, up to the last moment, unexpected by me.</p>

  <p>"Could you spell something in Russian?" was the next question. &mdash;
  "Yes," was the answer.</p>

  <p>Some lingual tests were then given, but I found it hard to follow them,
  for spelling out with the alphabet is hard work even in one's own tongue. The
  Dutch artist addressed the Intelligence in several languages, and received
  correct "Yes" or "No" answers, which showed comprehension.</p>

  <p>"Have you a message for us?" I then asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Then I will give you the alphabet."</p>

  <p>It was slow work, but this was the queer sentence which finally was
  hammered out:</p>

  <p>"Artists must rouse selfish nations."</p>

  <p>I thought that by "artists" he was using a short cut to express the idea
  of all men of intelligence and imagination.</p>

  <p>We asked if this was the whole message, and were told that it was not. As
  the alphabet procedure was so slow and clumsy, Mr. Horace Leaf suggested that
  we should put the table aside, sit in a circle, and invite the spirit to
  control one or other of us.</p>

  <p>Both Mr. Leaf and the artist volunteered to be the subjects of the
  experiment. We rearranged ourselves, therefore, and sang "Lead, kindly
  light," for the sake of harmony and vibration.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in the pitch darkness, a strange voice broke in on a low, level,
  clear tone. It was Mr. Leaf's own personal guide.</p>

  <p>"There is a spirit here who wishes to speak. He is a strong spirit. No, I
  would not say that he is an evil spirit. His aura is not evil. Yes, he is
  foreign. I could not say more than that." The voice died away once more.</p>

  <p>Presently we heard gasps and short cries of pain. The spirit was
  endeavouring to possess Mr. Leaf. It was clearly ignorant of psychic things,
  and did not know how to set about it. What it really did was to produce
  violent muscular contractions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Owen on one side and the doctor on the other had all they could do to
  hold his twisting, convulsed arms. Then, with a long sigh, he came back to
  consciousness. The attempt had been a failure&mdash;and a painful one.</p>

  <p>We were at a loss now how to proceed, and the table was reintroduced while
  the Dutchman took my place as questioner. "The spirit is laughing," said the
  clairvoyante. She had on other occasions observed this sneering laugh.</p>

  <p>There is something slightly evidential here, for she had no recollection
  of Lenin's face as it was in life, but it may be recalled that he had a
  perpetual set contraction of his lips which gave the impression of a broad
  smile, which was belied by his serious eyes.</p>

  <p>From our new attempts we gathered that the rest of the message was an
  expression of the desire that Russia and Britain should be friends, with the
  warning that unless they could come to terms they would drift into war, in
  which Russia would be very strong.</p>

  <p>Such was the whole message. Immediately it was given the table turned
  dead, and we could obtain no further sign of intelligence. The clairvoyante
  reported the figure as sitting on the stairs for a time and then passing
  on.</p>

  <p>So ended our curious experience in the old house in mid-London. It cannot
  be said that there was anything objective to which the senses of all of us
  could testify. On the other hand, it is certain that we were all in earnest,
  that there was no pressure on the table, that the messages were clear, and
  that the whole course of events was consistent.</p>

  <p>In answer to a question the Intelligence said that he had lived in London
  and that he had known these premises, though he had never actually lodged
  there. It may be added that it is a place frequented by foreign artists, with
  Russians among them, and that Lenin during his stay in London might well have
  been there.</p>

  <p>Mr. Vale Owen's feeling was that the visitor took it for granted that we
  were artists also, and that in his message "artists" is in the vocative. If
  he were mistaken about our vocation it would prove that he was indeed
  external to ourselves. It was an appeal to us to rouse nations out of their
  selfishness&mdash;an appeal which could hardly come from an evil spirit.</p>

  <p>I am not sure of the doctor's conclusions, but I am convinced that
  everyone else in the company was convinced that we were in touch with a real
  entity, with a real message, and it is our hope that, the message being
  delivered, the ghost of mid-London will be heard of no more.</p>

  <p>Deception from the other side is an alternative and possible hypothesis,
  but we were all impressed by the extreme earnestness of this intelligence,
  and equally earnest were our own invocations to his honesty.</p><br>

  <h3>First published as "The Absolute Proof" in The Strand Magazine,  November 1920, with a different last paragraph<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">In his recent work, <i>Life After Death</i>, the late
  Professor Hyslop, who was formerly Professor of Logic at Columbia University
  and became the chief American authority upon matters psychic, has a sentence
  which sounds rather intolerant. It runs: "Any man who does not accept the
  existence of discarnate spirits and the proof of it is either ignorant or a
  moral coward." The words are literally true, and yet what removes the sting
  is that there is really no great reproach up to now in being ignorant. Much
  of the information is very recent and is contained in works which have not
  been translated and which are expensive and difficult to get. It is true that
  we have Crawford's splendid work at Belfast and Crookes's researches of fifty
  years ago, but both of these needed the corroboration and elucidation of the
  continental observers to bring out their full meaning. I will try in this
  article to show any man who is capable of adapting his mind to fresh facts
  that this tremendous issue is no longer a fair subject for debate, but has
  been definitely settled up to a certain point&mdash;a point which gives us a
  solid basis for the researches of the future. All recent discoveries, whether
  they be of aviation, wireless telegraphy, or other material novelties, are
  insignificant beside a development which shows us a new form of matter, with
  unheard-off properties, lying latent in all probability within each of us. By
  a strange paradox the searchers after spirit have come to know more about
  matter, and its extraordinary possibilities, than any materialist has
  learned.</p>

  <p>It should first be stated that the development of psychic phenomena was a
  gradual one, and that it was some years after the Hydesville outbreak before
  actual materializations of spirit were reported. During the 'sixties and
  'seventies they became more common, lending themselves greatly to fraud, as
  people had little critical knowledge as yet and darkness was a physical
  necessity for their production. Apart from the frauds, however,
  discriminating observers were aware that there was a large residuum of cases
  which were undoubtedly genuine. In examining and reporting these cases the
  witnesses averred that certain people, whom they called "materializing
  mediums," had the strange physical gift that they could put forth from their
  bodies a viscous, gelatinous substance which appeared to differ from every
  known form of matter in that it could solidify and be used for material
  purposes, and yet could be re-absorbed, leaving absolutely no trace even upon
  the clothes which it had traversed in leaving the body. This substance was
  actually touched by some enterprising investigators, who reported that it was
  elastic and appeared to be sensitive, as though it was really an organic
  extrusion from the medium's body. These views were naturally much ridiculed
  by scientific men, who disposed of them easily upon anatomical and also on
  general physical grounds. Later investigation has, however, shown, as I hope
  to demonstrate in this article, that in this as in others matters the early
  Spiritualists were the pioneers of truth, and that they had come upon the
  most singular manifestation of matter with which we have any acquaintance
  &mdash;a form which might almost be called a half-way house to Spirit.</p>

  <p>Mme. Alexandre-Bisson, a French lady with a scientific bent, set herself
  in the year 1909 to study this phenomenon, having as her subject a woman
  named Eva, who had the power of forming this substance, which Charles Richet,
  the great French physiologist, has named ectoplasm. She had as collaborator a
  German doctor, Schrenck-Notzing, who afterwards collected the notes of the
  sittings and had them published in French with Mme. Bisson's name appended,
  under the title <i>Les Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes dits de Materialization</i>.
  A single sentence from the preface gives the gist of the book. He says:</p>

  <p>"We have very often been able to establish that, by an unknown biological
  process, there comes from the body of the medium a material, at first semi-
  fluid, which possesses some of the properties of a living substance, notably
  that of the power of change, of movement, and of the assumption of definite
  forms."</p>

  <p>He adds: "One might doubt the truth of these facts if they had not been
  verified hundreds of times in the course of laborious tests under varied and
  very strict conditions." Could there be a more complete vindication of those
  early Spiritualists who for two generations bore with patience the ridicule
  of the world? Schrenck-Notzing ends his dignified preface by exhorting his
  fellow- worker to take heart.</p>

  <p>"Do not allow yourself to be discouraged in your efforts to open a new
  domain for science, either by foolish attacks, by cowardly calumnies, by the
  misrepresentation of facts, by the violence of the malevolent, or by any
  other sort of intimidation. Advance always along the path that you have
  opened, thinking of the words of Faraday, 'Nothing is too amazing to be
  true'."</p>

  <p>The methods of these wonderful experiments were as follows: All
  conceivable precautions were taken against fraud. Eva, the medium, seems, so
  far as one can trace her career, to have been no worse if she was no better
  than her fellows. A fierce controversy had raged round a previous series of
  experiments with her conducted in 1906 in Algiers, but Charles Richet and
  other observers who were present nad found no flaw in them. However, nothing
  was left to chance. The key of the s&eacute;ance room was kept in Mme.
  Bisson's own pocket. Eva was compelled to change into a special dress when in
  that room, undressing again when she emerged. She submitted to physical
  examinations at the hands of doctors. The illumination of the room was
  gradually increased until six strong, red, electric lamps were at work
  &mdash;red being, as in photography, the one bearable colour. Most important
  of all, a number of cameras, eight in the last period, were directed upon the
  medium from all angles, and these were operated by flashlight without
  warning, so that no motion upon her part could be unobserved. Altogether two
  hundred and one photographs were taken and reprinted in the book. The
  sittings lasted with intervals for four years, and were witnessed not only by
  Mme. Bisson and the German doctor, but by a number of scientific observers
  whose names are given.</p>

  <p>The results are, in my opinion, among the most notable of any
  investigation which has ever been recorded. It was testified by witnesses,
  and shown by the photographs, that there oozed from the medium's mucous
  membranes, and occasionally from her skin, this extraordinary gelatinous
  material. The pictures are strange and repulsive, but many of Nature's
  processes seem so in our eyes. You can see this streaky, viscous stuff
  hanging like icicles from the chin, dripping down on to the body and forming
  a white apron, or projecting in shapeless lumps from the orifices of the
  face. When touched, or when undue light came upon it, it writhed back into
  the body as swiftly and stealthily as the tentacles of a hidden octopus. If
  seized and pinched, the medium cried aloud. It would protrude through clothes
  and vanish again, leaving hardly any trace upon them. With the assent of the
  medium, a small piece was amputated. It dissolved in the box in which it was
  placed as snow would have done, leaving moisture and some large cells which
  might have come from a fungus. The microscope also disclosed epithelial cells
  from the mucous membrane in which the stuff seemed to originate. It should be
  explained that the usual Spiritualistic habit of putting the medium into a
  confined space formed by curtains was followed. This is called the cabinet.
  She sat therein upon a chair, but her hands always protruded, as an
  additional safeguard against fraud. The object of the cabinet is that some
  condensation of material, which we can best describe perhaps as a heavy
  vapour, is necessary before you get the ectoplasm. The methods call for
  clearer scientific definition, but in practice it is found that anything
  which will make an enclosed space and conserve force is of great importance.
  Those curious, curving draperies which are seen round spirit photographs are
  the means which the control upon the other side adopts for this end, and I
  have often observed that the spirit lights at a s&eacute;ance are hooded and
  flanked by some fine, filmy material for the same reason.</p>

  <p>The production of this strange ectoplasm is enough in itself to make such
  experiments revolutionary and epoch-making, but what follows is far stranger,
  and will answer the question in every reader's mind, "What has all this to do
  with spirits?" You must know, then, utterly incredible as it may appear, that
  this substance, after forming, begins in the case of some mediums, Eva being
  one, to curdle into definite shapes, and those shapes are human limbs and
  human faces, seen at first in two dimensions upon the flat, and then moulding
  themselves at the edges until they become detached and complete. Very many of
  the photographs exhibit these strange phantoms, which are often much smaller
  than life. Some of these faces may represent thought-forms from the brain of
  Eva taking visible form, and some rough resemblance has been traced between
  some of them and pictures which she may have seen and stored in the memory.
  One, for example, looks like an extremely rakish President Wilson with a
  moustache, while another resembles a ferocious rendering of M.
  Poincar&eacute;. One of them shows the word "Miroir" printed over the head of
  the medium, which some critics have claimed as showing that she had smuggled
  in the journal of that name, though what the object of such a proceeding
  could be has not been explained. Her own explanation was that the controlling
  forces had in some way, possibly by apport, brought in the word in order to
  convey the idea that these faces and figures are not their real selves, but
  their selves as seen in a mirror.</p>

  <p>Even now the reader may see no obvious connection with Spiritualism, but
  the next stage takes us all the way. When Eva is at her best, and it occurs
  only at long intervals and at some cost to her own health, there forms a
  complete figure; this figure is moulded to resemble some deceased person, the
  cord which binds it to the medium is loosened, a personality which either is
  or pretends to be that of the dead takes possession of it, and the breath of
  life is breathed into the image so that it moves and talks and expresses the
  emotions of the spirit within. The last word of the Bisson record is: "Since
  these s&eacute;ances and on numerous occasions the entire phantom has shown
  itself, it has come out of the cabinet, has begun to speak, and has reached
  Mme. Bisson, whom it has embraced on the cheek. The sound of the kiss was
  audible." Was there ever a stranger finale of a scientific investigation? It
  may serve to illustrate how impossible it is for even the cleverest of
  materialists to find any explanation of such facts which are consistent with
  his theories, that the only one which Mr. Joseph MacCabe, in his public
  debate with me, could put forward was that it was a case of the regurgitation
  of food! He seemed to me unaware that a close-meshed veil was worn over the
  medium's face in some of the experiments without in the least hampering the
  flow of the ectoplasm.</p>

  <p>These results, though checked in all possible ways, were none the less so
  amazing that the inquirer had a right to suspend judgment until they are
  confirmed. But this has been fully done. Dr. Schrenck-Notzing returned to
  Munich and there he was fortunate enough to find another medium, a Polish
  lady, who possessed the faculty of materialization. With her he conducted a
  series of experiments which he has recorded in his book, <i>Materialization-
  ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne.</i> Working with Stanislawa, the Polish medium, and
  adopting the same strict methods as with Eva, he produced exactly the same
  results. His hook overlaps that of Mme. Bisson, since he gives an account of
  the Paris experiments, but the most important part is the corroboration
  furnished by his check experiments in the summer of 1912 in Munich. The
  various photographs of the ectoplasm so far as they go are hardly to be
  distinguished from those already taken, so that any theory of elaborate fraud
  upon the part of Eva postulates the same fraud on the part of Stanislawa.
  Many German observers checked the sittings. In his thorough Teutonic fashion
  Schrenck- Notzing goes deeper into the matter than Mme. Bisson. He obtained
  hair from one of the materialized forms and compared it microscopically with
  hair from Eva (this incident occurred in the French series), showing by
  several tests that it could not be from the same person. He gave also the
  chemical result of an examination of a small portion of ectoplasm, which
  burned to an ash, leaving a smell as of horn. Chloride of soda (common salt)
  and phosphate of calcium were amongst the constituents. Finally, he actually
  obtained a cinematograph record of the ectoplasm pouring from the mouth of
  the medium. Part of this is reproduced in his book.</p>

  <p>It should be explained that though the medium was in a trance during these
  experiments she was by no means inanimate. A separate personality seemed to
  possess her, which might be explained as one of her own secondary
  individualities, or as an actual obsession from outside. This personality was
  in the habit of alluding with some severity to the medium, telling Mme.
  Bisson that she needed discipline and had to be kept up to her work.
  Occasionally this person showed signs of clairvoyance, explaining correctly,
  for example, what was amiss with an electric fitting when it failed to work.
  A running accompaniment of groans and protests from Eva's body seems to have
  been a mere animal outcry apart from intelligence. One observation of the
  German scientist is worth noting, as it suggests that great injustice may
  have been done in the past. He is commenting upon a case where Eva was
  entirely covered by a fantastic helmeted garment of ectoplasm and stood up
  from her chair. He says:</p>

  <p>"This case is interesting because it throws a light upon the state of so-
  called transfiguration, which in the sense used by the Spiritualists means
  that a medium plays the part of the spirit, since he is clad with
  materialized stuff and seeks to imitate the character of the person
  concerned. This transition stage is to be found in the career of nearly all
  materialization mediums. Literature records a number of exposures of such
  mediums acting the part of spirits, like the medium Bastian before Grown
  Prince Rudolph, Crookes's medium Miss Cook, Mme. Esperance, and others. In
  all these cases people seized the medium, but the stuff used for the disguise
  vanished instantly and could not afterwards be traced."</p>

  <p>Spiritualists have been slow in advancing this plea, lest it seem to
  exonerate real fraud, but this conclusion from a man of science in an
  independent position should be set on record lest indiscriminate disgrace
  should fall upon the human hyena with his material muslin and the true medium
  in trance clad in ectoplasmic drapery.</p>

  <p>These separate results of the German and the French investigators would
  seem final to any reasonable mind, but they are corroborated once again by
  the shorter research of the late Dr. Geley, of Paris, who held a series of
  sittings with Eva, summoning a hundred men of science to witness one or other
  of them. So strict were his tests that he winds up his account in
  <i>Physiologie Supernormale</i> with the words: "I will not merely say that
  there is no fraud, I will say that there has not been the possibility of
  fraud." Again he walked the old path and found the same results, save that
  the phantasms in his experiments took the form of female faces, sometimes
  beautiful and, as he assures me, unknown to him. They may be thought-forms
  from Eva, for in none of his recorded results did he get an absolute living
  entity. There was enough, however, to cause Dr. Geley to say: "What we have
  seen kills materialism. There is no longer any room for it in the world." By
  this he means, of course, the old-fashioned materialism of Victorian days, by
  which thought was a result of matter. All the new evidence points to matter
  being the result of thought. It is only when you ask, "Whose thought?" that
  you get upon debatable ground. "They had great beauty and a remarkable
  appearance of life," says Dr. Geley, though they came as miniatures as well
  as full size.</p>

  <p>Once again, then, Mme. Bisson is corroborated, and we have three separate
  investigators and two separate mediums giving identical results. Is it not a
  perfect insanity of incredulity to wave these things aside because they will
  not fit into our present philosophies? Surely it is evident that the time has
  come when the philosophies must be expanded to receive them.</p>

  <p>Now, having thoroughly got it into our heads that it is possible for a
  person to evolve very singular stuff with a tendency to form human frames
  which seem for a time to be tenanted by independent intelligence, let us hark
  back and apply the knowledge to cases which were proved but not understood
  before these wonderful experiments. At once the instance of Crookes and
  Florrie Cook in 1873 springs to the front. In this classic case, as is well
  known, the celebrated chemist for three years experimented with this young
  medium, who put herself at his disposal in order to clear herself of a charge
  of personation made against her. It may well have been an example of
  transfiguration, as may some other alleged cases which were said to have
  occurred in later years when she was Mrs. Corner. Crookes exonerated her
  completely as the result of his research. She was shut up in the dark time
  and again in his small study. Then, after an hour or so, there would emerge
  into the adjoining laboratory an entirely different woman, who moved, spoke,
  and gave her name as Katie King, saying that she was a spirit who had lived
  in the reign of Charles II, and was now permitted for a brief visit to
  inhabit the body moulded from Miss Cook, who could be heard, and on certain
  occasions seen, in the adjoining room. Naturally the obvious criticism was
  made that this <i>was</i> Miss Cook masquerading as a phantom, but the first
  objection to such a theory was that it makes Professor Crookes out to be
  either a lunatic or a deliberate liar. No one but a lunatic could be so
  deceived, and no one but a liar could declare that the new-comer was four and
  a half inches taller than the medium, had beautiful brown hair, a long tress
  of which was traced up to the scalp and then severed (Miss Cook was a
  brunette), and finally that the pulse rate of the two women was entirely
  different. The whole course of Crookes's life proved that he was neither liar
  nor lunatic, and so a reasonable man could only believe that this prodigy
  corroborated by forty photographs was true, but totally unrelated to any
  other facts of the universe.</p>

  <p>But now the matter appears otherwise. Thanks to the recent researchers, we
  are in a position to enter that darkened room and to reconstruct what is
  happening to Florrie Cook. She lies with an occasional animal moan upon the
  sofa. From her there drains the vital ectoplasm, forming a cloud of viscous
  substance, a pattern, and finally a form. The form disengages, the cord
  breaks, and Katie King, infusing her spirit into this reconstruction of what
  was probably a simulacrum of her earthly body, walks forth to spend her
  strange brief hour upon earth, conversing with Professor Crookes, playing
  with his children, telling them stories of older days, and finally, with the
  words, "My mission is finished," leaving them for ever. Her mission was to
  prove the survival of the spirit to an incredulous generation, and it would
  indeed have been accomplished had it depended upon the bravery of her
  witness, and not upon the dense stupidity, prejudice and materialism of the
  scientific, religious, and journalistic world in which he lived. Now after
  many days we are slowly understanding the message.</p>

  <p>So much for the Crookes episode, and the light which has now been thrown
  upon it. But there is another famous series of investigations which are also
  confirmed and illuminated by this new knowledge. These are the very
  remarkable experiments made by Dr. Crawford, of Belfast, upon the medium Miss
  Goligher, and described in two successive books, <i>The Reality of Psychic
  Phenomena</i> and <i>Experiments in Psychic Science</i>. Miss Goligher, as
  her portrait indicates, is'a young lady of character and education, sprung
  from a decent Belfast family&mdash;a fact which has not prevented our
  opponents, in their desperate plight for an explanation, from endeavouring
  without a shred of evidence to depict her as a systematic fraud. It is a
  deplorable thing that people with this rare power, who submit themselves
  unpaid for the research of scientific men, should be assailed in this
  fashion, for it frightens others away, and makes the whole investigation more
  difficult.</p>

  <p>The main lesson, as it seems to me, to be drawn from the Crawford
  experiments is that the ectoplasm is a substance which can be used for many
  purposes by the force which lies behind it. In the former cases it was used
  to build up moulds of the human figure. In the Belfast experiments this same
  ectoplasm was used for the making of rods or columns of power, which
  protruded from the body of the unconscious girl, and produced results such as
  raps, or the movement of objects, at a distance from her. Such a rod of power
  might be applied, with a sucker attachment, under a table and lift it up,
  causing the weight of the table to be added to that of the medium, exactly as
  if she had produced the effect by a steel bar working as a cantilever and
  attached to her body. Or it might be placed above the table and hold it down,
  a loss of weight of thirty, forty, or even fifty pounds being registered upon
  the weighing chair on which Miss Goligher sat. The medium became a mere
  residuum, with a third and more of her own substance outside herself, the
  difference showing itself rather in a refining of the whole body than in a
  visible loss of substance. One can well believe that under such abnormal
  circumstances any rough disturbance of the conditions which caused the
  external third to fly back with unnatural speed to the body would cause
  physical suffering. I have known a medium have a broad weal from breast to
  armpit through the sudden elastic recoil of the ectoplasm. Is it a wonder,
  then, that Spiritualists object to the type of researcher who suddenly
  flashes a powerful electric torch in the middle of a s&eacute;ance? When this
  matter is more clearly understood our descendants will, I think, be appalled
  as well as amused by some of the incidents which have been the outcome of our
  ignorance.</p>

  <p>Dr. Crawford's experiments have been an explanation and a justification of
  the ordinary phenomena of the dark s&eacute;ance. No philosophical
  unprejudiced mind could have failed to see that results which are always of
  the same type, whether the conditions be produced in Iceland or in Java, must
  have fixed laws underlying them. Our critics have continually bemused
  themselves by considering individual cases and failing to take a broad view
  of the cumulative evidence. Dr. Crawford makes every detail plain. He has
  even, by staining with moist carmine a cloth in front of the medium, got
  crimson marks at a distance showing that the column of force as it pushed
  forward was solid enough to carry some of the staining agent with it. This is
  a particularly fine and convincing experiment.</p>

  <p>This is but a very brief indication of the general line taken by this
  remarkable research. Once again a sceptic may say, But this is physical power
  of some unknown type and not an intelligence apart from the sitters. A fuller
  knowledge, however, shows that at every stage there was a controlling
  intelligence, advising, directing, and showing its wishes by a code of
  signals. Whose intelligence was it? "I am quite satisfied in my own mind that
  the operators are discarnate human beings," says Dr. Crawford in his very
  latest work, with all the results before him. I do not see how anyone else is
  in a position to go behind his own interpretation of the facts which he has
  himself made clear. He appears to have begun his investigation in the
  agnostic attitude, which is the ideal starting-point for the truly scientific
  mind, but he had the courage and adaptability which made him gain positive
  results instead of that endless round of experiments leading to no conclusion
  which is typical of so many psychical researchers.</p>

  <p>Such, then, is the story of Mme. Bisson, of Dr. Schrenck-Notzing, of Dr.
  Geley, of Professor Crookes, and of Dr. Crawford. Can it be laughed away? Is
  it not time, after seventy years of ever-varying proof, that such an attitude
  be abandoned? But when it is abandoned, and when the conclusions have been
  accepted, what an eternity of ridicule is waiting for those solemn
  Panjandrums of Science who have for so long held up their warning hands lest
  the public should believe the truth!</p>

  <p>The story of the Italian Cardinals and Galileo will seem reasonable when
  compared with the attitude of Victorian science to this invasion of the
  beyond. Of the theologians I say nothing, for that is another aspect of the
  matter, and they have only lived up to their own record; but material
  science, which made mock of mesmerism until for very shame it had to change
  its name to hypnotism before acknowledging it, has a sad reckoning before it
  in the case of Spiritualism. The fear is lest the reaction go too far, and in
  contemplating its colossal blunder we may forget or underrate the thousand
  additions which it has made to the comfort of the human race.</p>

  <p>Be this as it may, who can read the facts here quoted and doubt that in
  those mists and shadows which hang round this uncharted coast we have at
  least one solid, clear-cut cape which juts out into the sunshine? Behind,
  however, lies a hinterland of mystery which successive generations of
  pioneers will be called upon to explore.</p>

  <p>Since this essay was written fresh demonstrations and photographs of
  ectoplasm have been taken from Mrs. Crandon (Margery) in Boston, from the
  medium of Dr. Hamilton in Winnipeg, and from Mrs. Henderson of London. If any
  person can examine all these photographs, taken from such varied subjects,
  can observe their similarity, and can then doubt that a new field for study
  has opened up for Science, such a person seems to me to be incapable of
  receiving a new idea or of forming a sane judgment.</p>

  <h3> First published as "A Worker of Wonders" in The Strand Magazine, May 1921<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">On the early morning of April 9, 1855, the steam packet
  <i>Africa</i>, from Boston, was drawing into Liverpool Docks. Captain
  Harrison, his responsibility lifted from him, was standing on the bridge, the
  pilot beside him, while below the passengers had assembled, some bustling
  about with their smaller articles of luggage, while others lined the decks
  and peered curiously at the shores of Old England. Most of them showed
  natural exultation at the successful end of their voyage, but among them was
  one who seemed to have no pleasant prospects in view. Indeed, his appearance
  showed that his most probable destiny would make him independent of any
  earthly career. This was a youth some two and twenty years of age, tall,
  slim, with a marked elegance of bearing and a fastidious neatness of dress,
  but with a worn, hectic look upon his very expressive face, which told of the
  ravages of some wasting disease. Blue-eyed, and with hair of a light auburn
  tint, he was of the type which is peculiarly open to the attack of tubercle,
  and the extreme emaciation of his frame showed how little power remained with
  him by which he might resist it. An acute physician watching him closely
  would probably have given him six months of life in our humid island. Yet
  this young man was destined, as many of us think, to be the instrument in
  making a greater change in English thought than any traveller for
  centuries&mdash;a change only now slowly developing and destined, as I think,
  to revolutionize for ever our views on the most vital of all subjects. For
  this was Daniel Dunglas Home, a youth of Scottish birth and extraction,
  sprung, it is said, from the noble Border family of that name, and the
  possessor of strange personal powers which make him, with the possible
  exception of Swedenborg, the most remarkable individual of whom we have any
  record since the age of the Apostles, some of whose gifts he appeared to
  inherit. A deep melancholy lay upon his sensitive features as he viewed the
  land which contained no one whom he could call friend. Tears welled from his
  eyes, for he was a man of swift emotions and feminine susceptibilities. Then,
  with a sudden resolution, he disengaged himself from the crowd, rushed down
  to the cabin, and fell upon his knees in prayer. He has recorded how a spring
  of hope and comfort bubbled up in his heart, so that no more joyous man set
  his foot that day upon the Mersey quay, or one more ready to meet the fate
  which lay before him.</p>

  <p>But how strange a fate, and what a singular equipment with which to face
  this new world of strangers! He had hardly a relation in the world. His left
  lung was partly gone. His income was modest, though sufficient. He had no
  trade or profession, his education having been interrupted by his illness. In
  character he was shy, gentle, sentimental, artistic, affectionate, and deeply
  religious. He had a strong tendency both to art and the drama, so that his
  powers of sculpture were considerable, and as a reciter he proved in later
  life that he had few living equals. But on top of all this, and of an
  unflinching honesty which was so uncompromising that he often offended his
  own allies, there was one gift so remarkable that it threw everything else
  into insignificance. This lay in certain powers, quite independent of his own
  volition, coming and going with disconcerting suddenness, but proving to all
  who would examine the proof that there was something in this man's atmosphere
  which enabled forces outside himself and outside our ordinary apprehension to
  manifest themselves upon this plane of matter. In other words, he was a
  medium&mdash;the greatest on the physical side that the modern world has ever
  seen.</p>

  <p>A lesser man might have used his extraordinary powers to found some
  special sect of which he would have been the undisputed high priest, or to
  surround himself with a glamour of power and mystery. Certainly most people
  in his position would have been tempted to use them for the making of money.
  As to this latter point, let it be said at once that never in the course of
  the thirty years of his strange ministry did he touch one shilling as payment
  for his gifts. It is on sure record that as much as two thousand pounds was
  offered to him by the Union Circle in Paris in the year 1857 for a single
  s&eacute;ance, and that he, a poor man and an invalid, utterly refused. "I
  have been sent on a mission," he said; "that mission is to demonstrate
  immortality. I have never taken money for it, and I never will." There were
  certain presents from Royalty which cannot be refused without boorishness
  &mdash;rings, scarf pins, and the like, tokens of friendship rather than
  recompense, for before his premature death there were few monarchs in Europe
  with whom this shy youth from the Liverpool landing-stage was not upon terms
  of affectionate intimacy. Napoleon the Third provided for his only sister;
  the Emperor of Russia sponsored his marriage. What novelist would dare to
  invent such a career?</p>

  <p>But there are more subtle temptations than those of wealth. Home's
  uncompromising honesty was the best safeguard against those. Never for a
  moment did he lose his humility and his sense of proportion. "I have these
  powers," he would say: "I shall be happy up to the limit of my strength to
  demonstrate them to you if you approach me as one gentleman should approach
  another. I shall be glad if you can throw any further light upon them. I will
  lend myself to any reasonable experiment. I have no control over them &mdash;
  they use me but I do not use them. They desert me for months and then come
  back in redoubled force. I am a passive instrument&mdash;no more." Such was
  his unvarying attitude. He was always the easy, amiable man of the world,
  with nothing either of the mantle of the prophet or of the skullcap of the
  magician. Like most truly great men, there was no touch of pose in his
  nature. An index of his fine feeling is that when confirmation was needed for
  his results he would never quote any names unless he was perfectly certain
  that the owners would not suffer in any way through being associated with an
  unpopular cult. Sometimes, even after they had freely given leave, he still
  withheld the names, lest he should unwittingly injure a friend. When he
  published his first series of <i>Incidents in My Life</i> the <i>Saturday
  Review</i> waxed very sarcastic over the anonymous evidence of Countess
  O&mdash;, Count B&mdash;, Count de K&mdash;, Princess de B&mdash;, and Mrs.
  S&mdash;, who were quoted as having witnessed manifestations. In his second
  volume Home, having assured himself of the concurrence of his friends, filled
  the blanks with the names of the Countess Orsini, Count de Beaumont, Count de
  Komar, Princess de Beaurean, and the well- known American hostess, Mrs. Henry
  Senior. His Royal friends he never quoted at all, and yet it is notorious
  that the Emperor Napoleon III, the Empress Eugenie, the Czar, the Emperor
  William I of Germany, and the Kings of Bavaria and Wurtemberg were all
  equally convinced by his extraordinary powers. Never once was Home convicted
  of any deception either in word or in deed.</p>

  <p>In these days, when the facts of psychic phenomena are familiar to all
  save those who are wilfully ignorant, we can hardly realize the moral courage
  which was needed by Home in putting forward his powers and upholding them in
  public. To the average educated Briton in the material Victorian era, a man
  who claimed to be able to produce results which upset Newton's law of
  gravity, and which showed invisible mind acting upon visible matter, was
  <i>prima facie</i> a scoundrel and an impostor. The view of Spiritualism
  pronounced by Vice- Chancellor Gifford at the conclusion of the Home-Lyon
  trial was that of the class to which he belonged.</p>

  <p>He knew nothing of the matter, but took it for granted that anything with
  such claims must be false. No doubt similar things were reported in far-off
  lands and ancient books, but that they could occur in prosaic, steady old
  England, the England of bank rates and free imports, was too absurd for
  serious thought. It has been recorded that at this trial Lord Gifford turned
  to Home's counsel and said, "Do I understand you to state that your client
  claims that he has been levitated into the air?" The counsel assented, on
  which the judge turned to the jury and made such a movement as the
  high-priest may have made in ancient days when he rent his garments as a
  protest against blasphemy. In 1867 there were few of the jury who were
  sufficiently educated to check the judge's remarks, and it is just in that
  particular that we have made some progress in the fifty years between. Slow
  work; but Christianity took more than three hundred years to come into its
  own.</p>

  <p>Take this question of levitation as a test of Home's powers. It is claimed
  that more than a hundred times in good light, before reputable witnesses, he
  floated in the air. Consider the evidence. In 1857, in a chateau near
  Bordeaux, he was lifted to the ceiling of a lofty room in the presence of
  Mme. Ducos, widow of the Minister of Marine, and of the Count and Countess de
  Beaumont. In 1860 Robert Bell wrote an article, "Stranger than Fiction," in
  the <i>Cornhill</i>. "He rose from his chair," says Bell, "four or five feet
  from the ground... We saw his figure pass from one side of the window to the
  other, feet foremost, lying horizontally in the air." Dr. Gully, of Malvern,
  a well- known medical man, and Robert Chambers, the author and publisher,
  were the other witnesses. Is it to be supposed that these men were lying
  confederates, or that they could not tell if a man were floating in the air
  or pretending to do so? In the same year Home was raised at Mrs. Milner
  Gibson's house in the presence of Lord and Lady Clarence Paget&mdash;the
  former passing his hands underneath him to assure himself of the fact. A few
  months later, Mr. Wason, a Liverpool solicitor, with seven others saw the
  same phenomenon. "Mr. Home," he says, "crossed the table over the heads of
  the persons sitting around it." He added: "I reached his hand seven feet from
  the floor, and moved along five or six paces as he floated above me in the
  air." In 1861 Mrs. Parkes, of Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, tells how she
  was present with Bulwer Lytton and Mr. Hall when Home, in her own
  drawing-room, was raised till his hand was on the top of the door, and then
  floated horizontally forward. In 1866 Mr. and Mrs. Hall, Lady Dunsany and
  Mrs. Senior, in Mr. Hall's house, saw Home, his face transfigured and
  shining, twice rise to the ceiling, leaving a cross marked in pencil upon the
  second occasion, so as to assure the witnesses that they were not victims of
  imagination. In 1868 Lord Adare, Lord Lindsay, Captain Wynne, and Mr. Smith
  Barry saw Home levitate upon many occasions. A very minute account has been
  left by the first three witnesses of the occurrence of December 16 of this
  year, when, at Ashley House, Home, in a state of trance, floated out of the
  bedroom and into the sitting-room window, passing seventy feet above the
  street. After his arrival in the sitting-room he went back into the bedroom
  with Lord Adare, and upon the latter remarking that he could not understand
  how Home could have floated through the window, which was only partially
  raised, "he told me to stand a little distance off. He then went through the
  open space head first quite rapidly, his body being nearly horizontal and
  apparently rigid. He came in again feet foremost." Such was the account given
  by Lords Adare and Lindsay. Upon its publication, Dr. Carpenter, who earned
  an unenviable reputation by a perverse opposition to every fact which bore
  upon this question, wrote exultantly to point out that there had been a third
  witness who had not been heard from, assuming, without the least
  justification, that Captain Wynne's evidence would be contradictory. He went
  the length of saying, "A single honest sceptic declares that Mr. Home was
  sitting in his chair all the time," a statement which can only be described
  as false. Captain Wynne at once wrote corroborating the others, and adding,
  "If you are not to believe the corroborative evidence of <i>three</i>
  unimpeached witnesses, there would be an end to all justice and courts of
  law." So many are the other instances of Home's levitations that a long
  article might easily be written upon this single phase of his mediumship.
  Professor Crookes was again and again a witness to the phenomenon, and refers
  to fifty instances which had come within his knowledge. But is there any
  fair-minded person, who has read the little that I have recorded above, who
  will not say with Professor Challis, "Either the facts must be admitted or
  the possibility of certifying facts by human testimony must be given up"?</p>

  <p>But now a word of explanation. "Are we then back in the age of miracles?"
  cries the reader. There is no miracle&mdash;nothing on this plane is
  supernatural. What we see now and what we have read of in ages past are but
  the operation of law which has not yet been studied and defined. Already we
  realize something of its possibilities and of its limitations, which are as
  exact in their way as those of any purely physical power. We must hold the
  balance between those who would believe nothing and those who would believe
  too much. Gradually the mists will clear and we will chart the shadowy coast.
  When the needle first sprang up at the magnet it was not an infraction of the
  laws of gravity. It was that there had been the local intervention of
  another, stronger force. Such is the case, also, when psychic powers act upon
  the plane of matter. Had Home's faith in this power faltered, or had his
  circle been unduly disturbed, he would have fallen. When Peter lost faith he
  sank into the waves. Across the centuries the same cause still produced the
  same effect. Spiritual power is ever with us if we do not avert our faces,
  and nothing has been vouchsafed to Judea which is withheld from England.</p>

  <p>It is in this respect, as a confirmation of the power of the unseen, and
  as a final answer to materialism as we now understand it, that Home's public
  career is of such supreme importance. He was an affirmative witness of the
  truth of those so-called "miracles," which have been the stumbling-block for
  so many earnest minds, and are now destined to be the strong, solid proof of
  the accuracy of the original narrative. Millions of doubting souls in the
  agony of spiritual conflict had cried out for definite proof that all was not
  empty space around us, that there were powers beyond our grasp, that the ego
  was not a mere secretion of nervous tissue, and that the dead did really
  carry on this personal, unbroken existence. All this was proved by this
  greatest of modern missionaries to anyone who could observe and reason. It is
  easy to poke superficial fun at rising tables and quivering walls, but they
  were the nearest and most natural objects which could record in material
  terms that power which was beyond our human ken. A mind which would be
  unmoved by an inspired sentence was struck into humility and into new paths
  of research in the presence of even the most homely of these inexplicable
  phenomena. It is easy to call them puerile, but they effected the purpose for
  which they were sent by shaking to its foundations the complaisance of those
  material men of science who were brought into actual contact with them. They
  are to be regarded not as ends in themselves, but as the elementary means by
  which the mind should be diverted into new channels of thought. And those
  channels of thought led straight to the recognition of the survival of the
  spirit. "You have conveyed incalculable joy and comfort to the hearts of many
  people," said Bishop Clark of Rhode Island. "You have made dwelling-places
  light that were dark before." "Mademoiselle," said Home to the lady who was
  to be his wife, "I have a mission entrusted to me; it is a great and a holy
  one." The famous Dr. Elliotson, immortalized by Thackeray under the name of
  Dr. Goodenough, was one of the leaders of British materialism. He met Home,
  saw his powers, and was able soon to say that he had lived all his life in
  darkness and had thought, there was nothing in existence but the material;
  but he now had a firm hope which he trusted he would hold while on earth.
  Innumerable instances could be quoted of the spiritual value of his work, but
  it has never been better summed up than in a paragraph from Mrs. Webster, of
  Florence, who saw much of his ministry. "He is the most marvellous missionary
  of modern times, in the greatest of all causes, and the good that he has done
  cannot be reckoned. Where Mr. Home passes he bestows around him the greatest
  of all blessings&mdash;the certainty of a future life." Now that the details
  of his career can be read it is to the whole wide world that he brings this
  most vital of all messages.</p>

  <p>It is curious to see how his message affected those of his own generation.
  Reading the account of his life written by his widow&mdash;a most convincing
  document, since she, of all living mortals, must have known the real
  man&mdash;it would appear that his most utterly whole-hearted support and
  appreciation came from those aristocrats of France and Russia with whom he
  was brought into contact. The warm glow of personal admiration and even
  reverence in their letters is such as can hardly be matched in any biography.
  In England he had a close circle of ardent supporters, a few of the upper
  classes, with the Halls, the Howitts, Robert Chambers, Mrs. Milner Gibson,
  Professor Crookes, and others. But there was a sad lack of courage among
  those who admitted the facts in private and stood aloof in public. Lord
  Brougham and Bulwer Lytton were of the type of Nicodemus, the novelist being
  the worst offender. The "Intelligentsia" on the whole came badly out of the
  matter, and many an honoured name suffers in the story. Faraday and Tyndall
  were fantastically unscientific in their methods of prejudging a question
  first, and offering to examine it afterwards on the condition that their
  prejudgment was accepted. Sir David Brewster said some honest things, and
  then, in a panic, denied that he had said them, forgetting that the evidence
  was on actual record. Browning wrote a long poem&mdash;if such doggerel can
  be called poetry&mdash;to describe an exposure which had never taken place.
  Carpenter earned an unenviable notoriety as an unscrupulous opponent, while
  proclaiming some strange spiritualistic thesis of his own. The secretaries of
  the Royal Society refused to take a cab drive in order to see Crookes'
  demonstration of the physical phenomena, while they pronounced roundly
  against them. Lord Gifford inveighed from the Bench against a subject the
  first elements of which he did not understand. As to the clergy, such an
  order might not have existed during the thirty years that this, the most
  marvellous spiritual outpouring of many centuries, was before the public. I
  cannot recall the name of one British clergyman who showed any intelligent
  interest, and when in 1872 a full account of the St. Petersburg
  s&eacute;ances began to appear in <i>The Times</i>, it was cut short,
  according to Mr. H. T. Humphreys, "on account of strong remonstrances to Mr.
  Delane, the editor, by certain of the higher clergy of the Church of
  England." Such was the contribution of our official spiritual guides. Dr.
  Elliotson, the Rationalist, was far more alive than they. The rather bitter
  comment of Mrs. Home is: "The verdict of his own generation was that of the
  blind and deaf upon the man who could hear and see."</p>

  <p>Home's charity was among his more beautiful characteristics. Like all true
  charity, it was secret, and only comes out indirectly and by chance. One of
  his numerous traducers declared that he had allowed a bill for fifty pounds
  to be sent in to his friend, Mr. Rhymer. In self-defence it came out that it
  was not a bill, but a cheque most generously sent by Home to help this friend
  in a crisis. Considering his constant poverty, fifty pounds probably
  represented a good part of his bank balance. His widow dwells with pardonable
  pride upon the many evidences found in his letters after his death. "Now it
  is an unknown artist for whose brush Home's generous efforts had found
  employment; now a distressed worker writes of his sick wife's life saved by
  comforts that Home provided; now a mother thanks him for a start in life for
  her son. How much time and thought he devoted to helping others when the
  circumstances of his own life would have led most men to think only of their
  own needs and cares." "Send me a word from the heart that has known so often
  how to cheer a friend!" cries one of his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>.
  "Shall I ever prove worthy of all the good you have done me?" says another
  letter. We find him roaming the battlefields round Paris, often under fire,
  with his pockets full of cigars for the wounded, A German officer writes
  affectionately to remind him how he saved him from bleeding to death, and
  carried him on his own weak back out of the place of danger. Truly Mrs.
  Browning was a better judge of character than her spouse, and Sir Galahad a
  better name than Sludge.</p>

  <p>There are few of the varied gifts which we call "mediumistic," and St.
  Paul "of the spirit," which Home did not possess&mdash;indeed, the
  characteristic of his psychic power was its unusual versatility. We speak
  usually of a direct voice medium, of a trance speaker, of a clairvoyant, or
  of a physical medium, but Home was all four. To take St. Paul's gifts in
  their order he had "the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge" when in his
  trance utterances he described the life beyond. "The gift of healing" was
  with him, and the account of his curing young De Cardonne of total deafness
  or of Mme. de Lakine of paralysis is historical. "The operation of great
  works" was shown in his phenomena when the very building would shake from an
  unknown power. "Discerning of spirits" was continually with him. There is no
  note, however, of prophecy or of the gift of tongues. So far as can be
  traced, he had little experience of the powers of other mediums, and was not
  immune from that psychic jealousy which is a common trait of these
  sensitives. Mrs. Jencken, formerly Miss Kate Fox, was the only other medium
  with whom he was upon terms of friendship. He bitterly resented any form of
  deception, and carried this excellent trait rather too far by looking with
  eyes of suspicion upon all forms of manifestation which did not exactly
  correspond with his own. This opinion, expressed in an uncompromising manner
  in his last book, <i>Lights and Shadows of Spiritualism</i>, gave natural
  offence to other mediums who claimed to be as honest as himself. A wider
  acquaintance with phenomena would have made him more charitable. Thus he
  protested strongly against any s&eacute;ance being held in the dark, but this
  is certainly a counsel of perfection, for experiments upon the ectoplasm,
  which is the physical basis of all materializations, show that it is fatally
  affected by light unless it is tinted red. Home had no large experience of
  complete materializations, such as those obtained in those days by Miss
  Florrie Cook or Mme. d'Esperance or in our own time by Mme. Bisson's medium,
  and therefore he could dispense with complete darkness in his own ministry.
  Thus his opinion was unjust to others. Again, Home declared roundly that
  matter could not pass through matter, because his own phenomena did not take
  that form, and yet the evidence that matter can in certain cases be passed
  through matter seems to be overwhelming. Even birds of rare varieties have
  been brought into s&eacute;ance rooms under circumstances which seem to
  preclude fraud, and the experiments of passing wood through wood as shown
  before Z&ouml;llner and the other Leipzig professors were quite final, as set
  forth in the famous physicist's account, in <i>Transcendental Physics</i> of
  his experiences with Slade. Thus it may count as a small flaw in Home's
  character that he decried and doubted the powers which he did not himself
  happen to possess.</p>

  <p>Some also might count it as a failing that he carried his message rather
  to the leaders of society and of life than to the vast toiling masses. It is
  probable that Home had, in fact, the weakness as well as the graces of the
  artistic nature, and that he was most at ease and happiest in an atmosphere
  of elegance and refinement, with a personal repulsion from all that was
  sordid and ill-favoured. If there were no other reason, the precarious state
  of his health unfitted him for any sterner mission, and he was driven by
  repeated h&aelig;morrhages to seek the pleasant and refined life of Italy,
  Switzerland, and the Riviera. But for the prosecution of his mission, as
  apart from personal self-sacrifice, there can be no doubt that his message
  carried to the laboratory of a Crookes or to the court of a Napoleon was more
  useful than if it were laid before the crowd. The assent of science and of
  character was needed before the public could gain assurance that such things
  were true. If it was not fully gained, the fault lies assuredly with the hide
  bound men of science and thinkers of the day, and by no means with Home, who
  played his part of actual demonstration to perfection, leaving it to other
  and less gifted men to analyse and to make public that which he had shown
  them. He did not profess to be a man of science, but he was the raw material
  of science, willing and anxious that others should learn from him all that he
  could convey to the world, so that science should itself testify to religion,
  while religion should be buttressed upon science. When Home's message has
  been fully learned, an unbelieving man will not stand convicted of impiety,
  but of ignorance.</p>

  <p>There was something pathetic in Home's efforts to find some creed in which
  he could satisfy his own gregarious instinct&mdash;for he had no claims to be
  a strong-minded individualist&mdash;and at the same time find a niche into
  which he could fit his own precious packet of assured truth. His pilgrimage
  vindicates the assertion of some Spiritualists that a man may belong to any
  creed and carry with him the spiritual knowledge, but it also bears out those
  who reply that perfect harmony with that spiritual knowledge can only be
  found, as matters now stand, in a special Spiritualist community. Alas, that
  it should be so! For it is too big a thing to sink into a sect, however great
  that sect might become. Home began in his youth as a Wesleyan, but soon left
  them for the more liberal atmosphere of Congregationalism. In Italy the
  artistic atmosphere of the Roman Catholic Church, and possibly its record of
  so many phenomena, akin to his own, caused him to become a convert with an
  intention of joining a monastic order&mdash;an intention which his common
  sense caused him to abandon. The change of religion was at a period when his
  psychic powers had deserted him for a year, and his confessor assured him
  that as they were of evil origin they would certainly never be heard of again
  now that he was a son of the true Church. None the less, on the very day that
  the year expired they came back in renewed strength. From that time Home
  seems to have been only nominally a Catholic, if at all, and after his second
  marriage&mdash;both his marriages were to Russian ladies &mdash;he was
  strongly drawn towards the Greek Church, and it was under their ritual that
  he was at last laid to rest at St. Germain in 1886. "To another discerning of
  spirits" (i Cor. xii. 10) is the short inscription upon that grave, of which
  the world has not yet heard the last.</p>

  <p>If proof were needed of the blamelessness of Home's life, it could not be
  better shown than by the fact that his numerous enemies, spying ever for some
  opening to attack, could get nothing in his whole career upon which to
  comment save the wholly innocent affair which is known as the Home-Lyon case.
  Any impartial judge, reading the depositions in this case&mdash;they are to
  be found verbatim in the second series of <i>Incidents from My Life</i>
  &mdash;would agree that it is not blame but commiseration which was owing to
  Home. One could desire no higher proof of the nobility of his character than
  his dealings with this unpleasant, freakish woman, who first insisted upon
  settling a large sum of money upon him, and then, her whim having changed,
  and her expectations of an immediate introduction into high society being
  disappointed, stuck at nothing in order to get it back again.</p>

  <p>Had she merely asked for it back, there is little doubt that Home's
  delicate feelings would have led him to return it, even though he had been
  put to much trouble and expense over the matter, which had entailed a change
  of his name to Home-Lyon, to meet the woman's desire that he should be her
  adopted son. Her request, however, was so framed that he could not honourably
  agree to it, as it would have implied an admission that he had done wrong in
  accepting the gift. If one consults the original letters&mdash;which few of
  those who comment upon the case seem to have done&mdash;you find that Home,
  S.C. Hall as his representative, and Mr. Wilkinson as his solicitor, implored
  the woman to moderate the unreasonable benevolence which was to change so
  rapidly into even more unreasonable malevolence. She was absolutely
  determined that Home should have the money and be her heir. A less mercenary
  man never lived, and he begged her again and again to think of her relatives,
  to which she answered that the money was her own to do what she pleased with,
  and that no relatives were dependent upon it. From the time that he accepted
  the new situation he acted and wrote as a dutiful son, and it is not
  uncharitable to suppose that this entirely filial attitude may not have been
  that which this elderly lady had planned out in her scheming brain. At any
  rate, she soon tired of her fad and reclaimed her money upon the excuse
  &mdash;a monstrous one to anyone who will read the letters and consider the
  dates&mdash;that spirit messages received through Home had caused her to take
  the action she had done. The case was tried in the Court of Chancery, and the
  judge alluded to Mrs. Lyon's "innumerable misstatements on many important
  particulars&mdash;misstatements upon oath so perversely untrue that they have
  embarrassed the Court to a great degree and quite discredited the plaintiff's
  testimony." In spite of this caustic comment, and in spite also of elementary
  justice, the verdict was against Home on the general ground that British law
  put the burden of disproof upon the defendant in such a case, and complete
  disproof is impossible when assertion is met by counter-assertion. Even
  Home's worst enemies were forced to admit that the fact that he had retained
  the money in England and had not lodged it where it would have been beyond
  recovery, proved his honest intentions in this the most unfortunate episode
  of his life. Such, within the compass of a short sketch, was the strange fate
  of the young man whom we saw land upon the Liverpool pier. He was at that
  time twenty-two. He died in his fifty-third year. In those thirty years he
  threw out seed with either hand. Much fell among stones; much was lost on the
  wayside; but much found a true resting-place, and has put forth a harvest the
  end of which no living man can see.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">THE RIFT IN THE VEIL</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "An Old Story Retold" in The Strand Magazine, November 1920<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">Whether the reader belongs to that majority who are
  incredulous upon the subject, or to that increasing minority who accept the
  evidence, he can hardly fail to be interested in the circumstances in which
  the whole strange psychic movement arose. The student is aware that there was
  a long preparatory stage which began with Swedenborg and Mesmer, and ended
  with Andrew Jackson Davis, called the Poughkeepsie seer, who at an early age,
  without education, wrote or dictated one of the deepest, most comprehensive
  explanations of the universe, ever framed. Passing these we will begin the
  narrative with the happenings of Hydesville, and give some account of these
  less-known developments which followed the new movement, sometimes to its
  great glory and sometimes to its temporary degradation.</p>

  <p>The hamlet of Hydesville, near Rochester, in the State of New York,
  consisted of a cluster of wooden houses of a very humble type. In one of
  these, a residence which would hardly pass the requirements of a British
  district council surveyor, there began this development which will, in my
  opinion, prove to be far the most important thing which America has given to
  the common weal of the world. It was inhabited by a decent farmer family of
  the name of Fox&mdash;a name which, by a curious coincidence, has been
  already registered in religious history as that of the evangel of the
  Quakers. Beside the father and mother, who were Methodists in religion, there
  were two children resident in the house at the time when the manifestations
  reached such a point of intensity that they attracted general attention.
  These children were the daughters, Margaret, aged fifteen, and Kate, aged
  twelve.</p>

  <p>About the beginning of 1848 many loud noises like sudden blows had been
  heard both by day and by night in the house, accompanied by a vibration of
  the furniture. Rats, mice and the hammering of a neighbouring cobbler were
  all put forward as explanations and each proved equally inadequate. As the
  spring advanced these sounds became more insistent and more varied in
  character, and occasionally were accompanied by actual motions of the
  furniture. It was soon observed that daylight was inimical to the phenomena,
  and the idea of trickery was thereby suggested, but careful watch by Mr. Fox
  failed to detect anything of the kind. Finally, on March 31st, there was a
  very loud and continued outbreak of inexplicable sounds. It was upon this
  evening that one of the great points in the history of psychic evolution was
  reached, for it was then that young Kate Fox, having lost all sense of fear
  in the presence of that which use had made familiar, challenged the unseen
  power to repeat the snaps of her fingers. This challenge, though given in
  flippant words, was instantly accepted. Each snap was answered by a knock.
  However humble the operator at either end, the spiritual telegraph was at
  last working, and it was left to the patience and moral earnestness of the
  human race to determine how high might be the uses to which it was put in the
  future. Unexplained forces were many in the world, but here was a force
  claiming to have independent intelligence at the back of it. That was the
  supreme sign of a new departure. "Fancy a new spiritual departure in a
  frame-house in an American hamlet!" Yes, and fancy a previous one in a
  camel-driver's tent in Arabia, and before that the greatest of all in a
  carpenter's shop in Judea! <i>Exaltavit humiles!</i> Mrs. Fox was amazed at
  this development, and at the further discovery that the force could
  apparently see as well as hear, for when Kate snapped her fingers without
  sound the rap still responded. The mother asked a series of questions, the
  answers to which, given in numerals, showed a greater knowledge of her own
  affairs than she herself possessed, for the raps insisted that she had had
  seven children, whereas she protested that she had six, until one who had
  died early came back to her mind. A neighbour, Mrs. Redfield, was called in,
  and her amusement was changed to wonder, and finally to awe, as she also
  listened to the correct answers to intimate questions.</p>

  <p>The neighbours came flocking in as some rumours of these wonders got
  about, and the two children were carried off by one of them, while Mrs. Fox
  went to spend the night at Mrs. Redfield's. In their absence the phenomena
  went on exactly the same as before, which disposes once for all of those
  theories of cracking toes and dislocating knees which have been so frequently
  put forward by people unaware of the true facts. The happenings of the night
  were at once recorded and were printed in pamphlet form within three weeks of
  the event, so that it would be difficult to get more prompt and direct
  testimony, which was subscribed to by a number of disinterested
  witnesses.</p>

  <p>Having formed a sort of informal committee of investigation, the crowd, in
  shrewd Yankee fashion, spent a large part of the night of March 3ist in
  playing question and answer with the unseen intelligence. According to its
  own account he was a spirit, he had been injured in that house, he rapped out
  the name of a former occupant who had injured him, he was thirty-one years
  old at the time of death, which was five years before, he had been murdered
  for money, he had been buried in the cellar ten feet deep. On descending to
  the cellar dull, heavy thumps, coming apparently from under the earth, broke
  out when the investigator stood at the centre. There was no sound at other
  times. That, then, was the place of burial! It was a neighbour named Duesler
  who, first of all modern men, called over the alphabet and got answers by
  raps on the letters. In this way the name of the dead man was obtained
  &mdash;Charles B. Rosma. The idea of connected messages was not developed
  until four months later, when Isaac Post, a Quaker of Rochester, was the
  first pioneer. Such, in very brief outline, were the events of March 3ist,
  which were continued and confirmed upon the succeeding night, when not less
  than a couple of hundred people had assembled round the house. Upon April
  2nd, it was observed that the raps came in the day as well as at night.</p>

  <p>Excavations were begun in the cellar, but the spring thaw and a swollen
  river had flooded the land, and water was struck a foot or so below the
  surface. When the summer came, a hole was dug by David Fox, the young son,
  who had come from a distant farm after the disturbances broke out. He was
  aided by Henry Bush, Lyman Granger of Rochester, and others. His account of
  what occurred was published in Capron's <i>Modern Spiritualism</i>, 1855, and
  was confirmed personally in conversation with the Hon. Dale Owen, so that the
  evidence is very clear and direct. They passed a plank five feet down, and
  below it came on some crockery, charcoal, and quicklime, under which was some
  human hair, several bones, and part of a human skull. Clearer evidence of
  murder and its concealment could hardly be asked for. These were
  corroborative details, for a young girl, Lucretia Pulver, came forward with
  an account of how a pedlar had called there while she was acting as "help" to
  Mr. and Mrs. B&mdash;. He had remained for the night, while she, the girl,
  had been sent away, and was kept away three days. The pedlar had promised to
  call at her father's house, but he never came. On her return she had heard
  for the first time the rappings and noises in the house. She observed that
  the centre of the cellar was soft, which was explained by Mrs. B&mdash; as
  being due to rat- holes. Afterwards, Mr. B&mdash; carried down some earth and
  was at work for some time. Shortly afterwards the B&mdash;s left the house
  and the neighbourhood, but their successors, the Weekmans, were conscious of
  the same noises which finally culminated under the Fox tenancy. As might be
  expected, B&mdash;, who was a blacksmith by trade, vigorously denied this
  accusation and produced many certificates as a proof that he was a man of
  good character. The spiritual story was also weakened by the fact that the
  man Rosma could not be traced in Orange Country, New York, whence he
  professed to have come, and a search for five alleged children was equally
  fruitless. We know now how difficult it is to get a name through correctly,
  and I think it very likely that "Ross" may have been the real surname. His
  non-recognition is less remarkable as he was by profession a wanderer. It
  must be admitted that the case against B&mdash; needed further corroboration
  before it could be called substantial. Two great undoubted results did
  emerge, however, which have never been shaken, that the origin of the raps
  could by no means be explained, and that they did convey the unknown fact
  that a human body had been buried in the cellar. This is the vital core of
  the whole matter, for it touched that which is of eternal interest to all of
  us, while the question of individual guilt is temporary and incidental.</p>

  <p>The danger of blindly following alleged spirit guidance was clearly shown
  some months later in the neighbouring town of Rochester, where a man
  disappeared under suspicious circumstances. An enthusiastic Spiritualist had
  messages by raps which announced a murder. The canal was dragged, and the
  wife of the missing man was actually ordered to enter the canal, which nearly
  cost her her life. Some months later the absentee returned, having fled to
  Canada to avoid a writ for debt. This, as may well be imagined, was a blow to
  the young cult. The public did not then understand what even now is so little
  understood, that death causes no change in the human spirit, that mischievous
  and humorous entities abound, and that the inquirer must use his own
  instincts and his own common sense at every turn. "Try the spirits that ye
  may know them." In the same year, in the same district, the truth of this new
  philosophy upon the one side, and its limitations and dangers on the other,
  were most clearly set forth. These dangers are with us still. The silly man,
  the arrogant inflated man, the cocksure man, is always a safe butt. Every
  observer has had some trick played upon him. I have myself had my faith
  sorely shaken by deception until some compensating proof has come along to
  assure me that it was only a lesson which I had received, and that it was no
  more fiendish or even remarkable that disembodied intelligences should be
  hoaxers, than that the same intelligence inside a human body should find
  amusement in the same foolish way.</p>

  <p>The first effect of the new dispensation was to bring utter misery and
  ruin to the Fox family. Within their house there were constant disturbances
  from the insistent manifestations, while from without they were plagued by
  sightseers and wonder-mongers, many of whom looked upon the unfortunate
  people as being concerned in something diabolical. Kate was sent away to
  Rochester to join her married sister, Mrs. Fish, but her absence appears to
  have had no effect upon the sounds which continued to disturb the family, who
  at last abandoned Hydesville altogether, hoping that the manifestations would
  remain behind. It speedily became evident, however, that the unseen powers
  were no longer attached to the place, but that they specially associated
  themselves with the two girls, for they were as insistent in the town as in
  the hamlet. In vain the family prayed with their Methodist friends that
  relief should come. In vain also were the exorcisms of the ministers of
  various creeds. Beyond joining with loud raps in the "Amens," the unseen
  presences took no notice of these religious exercises.</p>

  <p>The whole course of the movement had now widened and taken a more
  important turn. It was no longer a murdered man calling for justice. The
  pedlar seemed to have been used as a pioneer, and now that he had found the
  opening and the method, a myriad of Intelligences were swarming at his back.
  Isaac Post had instituted the method of spelling by raps, and messages were
  pouring through. According to these the whole system had been devised by the
  contrivance of a band of thinkers and inventors upon the spirit plane,
  foremost among whom was Benjamin Franklin, whose eager mind and electrical
  knowledge in earth life might well qualify him for such a venture. Whether
  this claim was true or not, it is a fact that Rosma dropped out of the
  picture at this stage, and that the intelligent knockings purported to be
  from the deceased friends of those inquirers who were prepared to take a
  serious interest in the matter, and to gather in reverent mood to receive the
  messages. That they still lived and still loved was the constant message from
  the beyond, accompanied by many material tests, which confirmed the wavering
  faith of the new adherents of the movement. When asked for their methods of
  working and the laws which governed them, the answers were from the beginning
  exactly what they are now&mdash;that it was a matter concerned with human and
  spirit magnetism, that some who were richly endowed with this physical
  property were mediums, that this endowment was not necessarily allied to
  morality or intelligence, and that the condition of harmony was especially
  necessary to secure good results. In eighty years we have learned very little
  more&mdash;and after all these years the primary law of harmony is invariably
  broken at the so-called test s&eacute;ances, the members of which imagine
  that they have disproved the philosophy when they obtain no results, whereas
  they have actually confirmed it.</p>

  <p>In one of the early communications the Fox sisters were assured that
  "these manifestations would go all over the world." This prophecy was soon in
  a fair way to be fulfilled, for these new powers, and further developments of
  them which included the discerning and hearing of spirits and the movement of
  objects without contact, appeared in many circles which were independent of
  the Fox family. In an incredibly short space of time the movement, with many
  eccentricities and phases of fanaticism, had swept over the Northern and
  Eastern States of the Union, always retaining that solid core of actual
  tangible fact, which might be occasionally simulated by impostors but always
  reasserted itself to the serious investigator who could shake himself free
  from preconceived prejudice. Disregarding for the moment these wider
  developments, let us continue the story of the original circles at
  Rochester.</p>

  <p>The spirit messages had urged upon the small band of pioneers a public
  demonstration of their powers in an open meeting at Rochester&mdash;a
  proposition which was naturally appalling to two shy country girls and to
  their friends. So incensed were the discarnate Guides by the opposition of
  their earthly agents, that they threatened to suspend the whole movement for
  a generation, and did actually desert them completely for some weeks. At the
  end of that time communication was restored, and the believers, chastened by
  this interval of thought, put themselves unreservedly into the hands of the
  outside forces, promising that they would dare all in the cause. It was no
  light matter. A few of the clergy, notably a Methodist named the Rev. A.H.
  Jervis, rallied to their aid, but the majority thundered from their pulpits
  against them, and the mob eagerly joined in the cowardly sport of
  heretic-baiting. On November 14, 1849, the Spiritualists held their first
  meeting at the Corinthian Hall, the largest available in Rochester. The
  audience, to its credit, listened with attention to the exposition of facts
  from Mr. Capron of Auburn, the principal speaker. A committee of five
  representative citizens was then selected to examine into the matter and to
  report upon the following evening, when the meeting would reassemble. So
  certain was it that this report would be unfavourable that the <i>Rochester
  Democrat</i> is stated to have had its leading article prepared, with the
  heading: "Entire Exposure of the Rapping Humbug." The result however, caused
  the editor to hold his hand. The committee reported that the raps were
  undoubted facts, though the information was not invariably correct. They
  added that these raps came on walls and doors some distance from the girls,
  causing a sensible vibration. "They entirely failed to find any means by
  which it could be done."</p>

  <p>This report was received with disapproval by the audience and a second
  committee from among the dissentients was formed. This investigation was
  conducted in the office of a lawyer. Kate, for some reason, was away, and
  only Mrs. Fish and Margaret present. None the less, the sounds continued as
  before, though a Dr. Langworthy was introduced to test the possibility of
  ventriloquism. The final report was that "the sounds were heard, and their
  thorough investigation had conclusively shown them to be produced neither by
  machinery nor ventriloquism, though what the agent is they were unable to
  determine."</p>

  <p>Again the audience turned down the report of their own committee, and
  again a deputation was chosen from among the most extreme opponents, one of
  whom vowed that if he could not find out the trick he would throw himself
  over the Falls of the Genessee River. Their examination was thorough to the
  length of brutality, and a committee of ladies were associated with it. The
  latter stripped the frightened girls, who wept bitterly under their
  afflictions. Their dresses were then tied tightly round their ankles, and
  they were placed upon glass and other insulators. The committee was forced to
  report "when they were standing on pillows with a handkerchief tied round the
  bottom of their dresses, tight to the ankles, we all heard the rapping on the
  wall and floor distinctly." The committee further testified that their
  questions, some of them mental, had been answered correctly. So long as the
  public looked upon the movement as a sort of joke it was prepared to be
  tolerantly amused, but when these successive reports put the matter in a more
  serious light, a wave of blackguardism swept over the town, which reached
  such a pitch that Mr. Willetts, a gallant Quaker, was compelled at the fourth
  public meeting to declare that "the mob of ruffians who designed to lynch the
  girls should do so, if they attempted it, over his dead body." There was a
  disgraceful riot, the young women were smuggled out by a back door, and
  reason and justice were for the moment clouded over by force and folly. Then,
  as now, the minds of the average men of the world were so crammed with the
  things that do not matter that they had no space for the things that do
  matter. But Fate is never in a hurry and the movement went on. Many accepted
  the findings of the successive committees as being final, and indeed it is
  difficult to see how the alleged facts could have been more severely tested.
  At the same time this strong new fermenting wine began to burst some of the
  old bottles into which it was poured, to the excusable disgust of the
  public.</p>

  <p>The many discreet, serious, and religious circles were for a season almost
  obscured by swollen-headed ranters, who imagined themselves to be in touch
  with every high entity from the Apostles downwards, some even claiming the
  direct afflatus of the Holy Ghost and emitting messages which were only saved
  from being blasphemous by their crudity and absurdity. One community of these
  fanatics, who called themselves the Apostolic Circle of Mountain Cove,
  particularly distinguished themselves by their extreme claims and furnished
  good material for the enemies of the new dispensation. The great body of
  Spiritualists turned away in disapproval from such exaggerations, but were
  unable to prevent them. Many well-attested supernormal phenomena came to
  support the failing spirits of those who were distressed by the excesses of
  the fanatics. On one occasion, which is particularly convincing and
  well-reported, two bodies of investigators in separate rooms received the
  same messages simultaneously from some central force which called itself
  Benjamin Franklin. This double message was: "There will be great changes in
  the nineteenth century. Things that now look dark will be made plain. The
  world will be enlightened." It must be admitted that the prophecy has up to
  now been only partially fulfilled&mdash;and it may at the same time be
  conceded that, with some startling exceptions, the forecasts of the Spirit
  people have not been remarkable for accuracy, especially where the element of
  time is concerned.</p>

  <p>The question has often been asked: "What was the purpose of so strange a
  movement at this particular time, granting that it is all that it claims to
  be?" Governor Tallmadge, a United States Senator of repute, was one of the
  early converts to the new cult, and he has left it upon record that he asked
  this question upon two separate occasions in two different years from
  different mediums. The answer in each case was almost identical. The first
  said: "It is to draw mankind together in harmony and to convince sceptics of
  the immortality of the soul." The second said: "To unite mankind and to
  convince sceptics of the immortality of the soul." Surely this is no ignoble
  ambition and does not justify those narrow and bitter attacks from ministers
  and the less progressive of their flocks from which Spiritualists have up to
  the present day had to suffer. The first half of the definition is, I think,
  particularly important, for I believe that one of the ultimate results of
  this movement will be to unite Christianity upon a common basis so strong
  and, indeed, self-sufficient that the quibbles which separate the Churches of
  to-day will be seen in their true proportion and will be swept away or
  disregarded. One could even hope that such a movement might spread beyond the
  bounds of Christianity and throw down some of the barriers which stand
  between great sections of the human race.</p>

  <p>Within two years from the crisis at Hydesville, the Fox sisters, still
  little more than children, were in New York, in the centre of the huge public
  discussion which raged round the subject. They stayed as guests for a short
  time in the house of Horace Greeley, the famous editor of the <i>New York
  Tribune</i>, one of the clearest thinkers in America, and whilst there gave
  constant exhibitions of their strange powers. Greeley had the courage to
  imperil the fortunes of his great newspaper by publicly stating that the
  phenomena which he had tested were undoubtedly genuine. "We devoted what time
  we could spare from our duties, out of three days, to this subject," he
  wrote:</p>

  <p>"It would be the basest cowardice not to say that we are convinced beyond
  a doubt of the ladies' perfect integrity and good faith. Whatever may be the
  origin or cause of the rappings, the ladies in whose presence they occur do
  not make them. We tested this thoroughly and to our entire satisfaction.
  Their conduct and bearing are as unlike that of deceivers as possible."</p>

  <p>So said Horace Greeley, cute Yankee and man of the world, after personal
  investigation. Against this, what is the worth of the opinion of people who
  even now talk nonsense about cracking joints and ventriloquism?</p>

  <p>What impressed the New Yorkers as much as the actual sounds was the
  extreme accuracy of the answers and the fact that unspoken questions were
  replied to as readily as those which were audible. We have records of one
  particular s&eacute;ance at which there were more famous men assembled than
  have ever perhaps been present at one demonstration. Among them were Fenimore
  Cooper, the novelist; Bancroft, the historian; Cullen Bryant and N.P. Willis,
  poets; Bigelow, Dr. Griswold, with several doctors and clergymen. As befitted
  such a company the phenomena were mental rather than material, but absolutely
  convincing. Mrs. Fox and the three daughters were the mediums. It is
  interesting to note that half an hour elapsed before any sounds were heard.
  Strong brains charged with prejudice were present and time was needed, even
  by those remarkable mediums, to harmonize the conditions. Then at last came
  slight sounds, increasing gradually in volume until they were very clear.
  Each member of the company in turn asked questions, some mentally, some
  aloud, and all attested that the correct answers were given by the knockings.
  The record is too long to give in detail, but some of the information was so
  exact and so unusual that it was absolutely convincing. It is said that
  nearly all the guests were converted by this remarkable experience, and that
  this knowledge coming when their feet were, as the future proved, on the very
  threshold of death, was of inestimable comfort to Cooper and to Willis.</p>

  <p>In the presence of these extraordinary happenings it may be imagined that
  American science was not silent. It was loud in its mockery and disapproval.
  At last the flood rising from that small spring at Hydesville had become so
  great that it would no longer be ignored. The religious exorcisms had failed.
  Could not science put a stop once for all to this disturbing intrusion? There
  were two scientists in the United States at that time who had a European
  reputation. One was Agassiz, the naturalist, the other Robert Hare, the
  chemist, who invented among other things the oyx-hydrogen blow-pipe. It was
  Robert Hare who went forth to slay the new delusion. He started in that
  thoroughly unscientific frame of mind in which science has always approached
  the question. He felt called upon, he said, "to bring whatever influence he
  possessed to the attempt to stem the tide of popular madness which, in
  defiance of reason and science, was fast setting in favour of the gross
  delusion called Spiritualism." This can hardly be called an impartial method
  of approaching an inquiry, and can only be compared with Faraday's
  contemporary assertion that in investigating such a matter one should make up
  one's mind beforehand what is possible and what is not. Here was a brave and
  honest man, however. The huge tome which recorded his investigation lies upon
  my table as I write. It is adorned with pictures of the spring balances,
  double tables, and other appliances with which he endeavoured to confound
  these heretics, and was himself confounded. So searching was his
  investigation that every possible source of error was eliminated. As a result
  Professor Hare declared after a year that he had been entirely mistaken, and
  that the claims of the new philosophy not only as to the phenomena, but as to
  their source and meaning, were absolutely justified. For this he was
  boycotted and bullied by the American Scientific Association, which seems to
  have behaved as unwisely as all of our own scientific bodies in its
  unreasoning opposition to what it did not comprehend. Whilst the report of
  this eminent scientific man was ignored, great stress was laid upon the
  absurd report of three unknown medical men of Buffalo, who declared that in
  their opinion the sounds made by the Fox sisters were caused by the repeated
  partial dislocations of their knee- joints. How these dislocations answered
  unspoken questions was not explained.</p>

  <p>The persecution endured by Professor Hare was repeated in the case of
  Judge Edmonds, head of the High Court of New York, who had also approached
  the movement with a view to exposing it, but who found himself confounded by
  the appearance of phenomena within his own family circle, and by the
  development of his own daughter into a medium, possessing in some directions
  greater powers than the Fox sisters. Like Professor Hare, he proclaimed his
  conversion in a book, and had to leave the Bench in consequence. Such
  intolerance was deplorable, and yet there is this excuse for it, that
  numerous cranks had burst into all sorts of wild theories, and also that the
  vile race of spurious mediums, or of mediums who eked out real powers by
  faked phenomena, were beginning to appear and to cause those scandals with
  which we are too familiar. Unable to distinguish the true from the
  counterfeit, the public, busy with its own affairs and impatient with the
  claims of another world, was glad to dismiss the whole subject as one vast
  delusion.</p>

  <p>A word must be said as to the tragic fate of the two younger Fox sisters,
  a subject which is painful to Spiritualists and yet must be faced. Both fell
  victims to that dipsomania which was hereditary in the family. Each had made
  a remarkably good marriage, Margaret becoming the wife of Dr. Kane, the
  famous Arctic explorer, while Kate married Mr. Jencken, a member of the
  English Bar. The latter was very thoroughly tested by Professor Crookes, who
  was a most severe critic of psychic powers, though opponents of the movement
  represent him as credulous. Margaret became a Roman Catholic, and high
  influences were used, according to her own account, to place her in a
  convent. What with religious excitement and her hereditary weakness she fell
  in her later years into a pitiable state, in which she alternately denounced
  Spiritualism, proclaiming herself an impostor, and recanted her statement
  with the most solemn vows. Personally, I am of opinion that she was by no
  means free from the suspicion that when psychic power was wanting she
  supplemented it by fraud. As to her final assertions and denials, I think
  that Father Thurston may be right when he says that both were in a sense
  true. Mr. Isaac Funk, the famous lexicographer, says of her in her later
  years, "For five dollars she would have denied her mother and sworn to
  anything."</p>

  <p>I have said that such a fate befalling the early mediums is painful to
  their friends, but it has small bearing upon their faith. A medium is in no
  sense a teacher or an example, but is a passive instrument for forces outside
  herself. There have been, and are, many mediums who have been of saintly
  mould. There have been others who have yielded to some human weakness, very
  especially to drink. Their powers and their message are to be held distinct
  from themselves, as a Catholic would hold that a bad priest may celebrate a
  true sacrament, or a materialist that a foolish operator may transmit a wise
  telegram. There weaknesses delay the acceptance of the new knowledge. It
  still stands upon the threshold&mdash;but the door is slowly opening.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">A NEW LIGHT ON OLD CRIMES</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, January 1920<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">Psychic science, though still in its infancy, has already
  reached a point where we can dissect many of those occurrences which were
  regarded as inexplicable in past ages, and can classify and even explain
  them&mdash;so far as any ultimate explanation of anything is possible. So
  long as gravity, electricity, magnetism, and so many other great natural
  forces are inexplicable one must not ask too much of the
  youngest&mdash;though it is also the oldest&mdash;of the sciences. But the
  progress made has been surprising&mdash;the more surprising since it has been
  done by a limited circle of students whose results have hardly reached the
  world at large, and have been greeted rather with incredulous contempt than
  with the appreciation which they deserve. So far have we advanced that of the
  eighty or ninety cases carefully detailed in Dale Owen's <i>Footfalls</i>,
  published in 1859, we find now, seventy years later, that there is hardly one
  which cannot be classified and understood. It would be interesting,
  therefore, to survey some of those cases which stand on record in our law
  courts, and have been variously explained in the past as being either
  extraordinary coincidences or as interpositions of Providence. The latter
  phrase may well represent a fact, but people must learn that no such thing
  has ever been known as an interposition of Providence save through natural
  law, and that when it has seemed inexplicable and miraculous it is only
  because the law has not yet been understood. All miracles come under exact
  law, but the law, like all natural laws, is itself divine and miraculous.</p>

  <p>We will endeavour in recounting these cases, which can only be done in the
  briefest fashion, to work from the simpler to the more complex&mdash;from
  that which may have depended upon the natural but undefined powers of the
  subconscious self, through all the range of clairvoyance and telepathy, until
  we come to that which seems beyond all question to be influenced by the
  spirit of the dead. There is one case, that of Owen Parfitt, of Shepton
  Mallet, in Somersetshire, which may form a starting-point, since it is really
  impossible to say whether it was psychic or not; but if it were not, it forms
  one of the most piquant mysteries which ever came before the British
  public.</p>

  <p>This old fellow was a seaman, a kind of John Silver, who lived in the
  piratical days of the eighteenth century and finally settled down, upon what
  were usually considered to have been ill-gotten gains, about the year 1760,
  occupying a comfortable cottage on the edge of the little Somerset town. His
  sister kept house for him, but she was herself too infirm to look after the
  rheumatic old mariner, so a neighbour named Susanna Snook used to come in by
  the day and help to care for him. It was observed that Parfitt went
  periodically to Bristol, and that he returned with money, but how he gained
  it was his secret. He appears to have been a secretive and wicked old
  creature, with many strange tales of wild doings, some of which related to
  the West Coast of Africa, and possibly to the slave trade. Eventually his
  infirmity increased upon him. He could no longer get farther than his garden,
  and seldom left the great chair in which he was placed every day by the
  ministering Susanna Snook, just outside the porch of the cottage.</p>

  <p>Then one summer morning, June 6, 1768, an extraordinary thing happened. He
  had been deposited as usual, with a shawl round his shoulders, while the
  hard-working Susanna darted back to her own cottage near-by. She was away for
  half an hour. When she returned she found, to her amazement, that the old
  seaman had disappeared. His sister was wringing her hands in great
  bewilderment over the shawl, which still remained upon the chair, but as to
  what became of the old reprobate nothing has ever been learned from that day
  to this. It should be emphasized that he was practically unable to walk and
  was far too heavy to be easily carried.</p>

  <p>The alarm was at once given, and as the haymaking was in full swing the
  countryside was full of workers, who were ready to declare that even if he
  could have walked he could not have escaped their observation upon the roads.
  A search was started, but it was interrupted by a sudden and severe storm,
  with thunder and heavy rain. In spite of the weather, there was a general
  alarm for twenty-four hours, which failed to discover the least trace of the
  missing man. His unsavoury character, some reminiscences of the Obi men and
  Voodoo cult of Africa, and the sudden thunderstorm, all combined to assure
  the people of Somerset that the devil had laid his claws upon the old seaman;
  nor has any natural explanation since those days set the matter in a more
  normal light. There were hopes once that this had been attained when, in the
  year 1813, some human bones were discovered in the garden of a certain Widow
  Lockyer, who lived within two hundred yards of the old man's cottage. Susanna
  Snook was still alive, and gave evidence at the inquiry, but just as it began
  to appear that perhaps the old man had been coaxed away and murdered, a
  surgeon from Bristol shut down the whole matter by a positive declaration
  that the bones were those of a woman. So the affair rests till to-day.</p>

  <p>No psychic explanation can be accepted in any case until all reasonable
  normal solutions have been exhausted. It is possible that those visits to
  Bristol were connected with blackmail, and that some deeper villain in the
  background found means to silence that dangerous tongue. But how was it done?
  It is a freakish, insoluble borderland case, and there we must leave it. The
  natural question arises: If you have spirit communications why are you unable
  to get an explanation? The answer is that spirit communication is also
  governed by inexorable laws, and that you might as well expect an electric
  current along a broken wire as to get a communication when the conditions
  have become impossible.</p>

  <p>Passing on to a more definite example, let us take the case of the murder
  of Maria Marten, which was for a long time a favourite subject when treated
  at village fairs under the name of "The Mystery of the Red Barn." Maria
  Marten was murdered in the year 1827 by a young farmer named Corder, who
  should have married her but failed to do so, preferring to murder her in
  order to conceal the result of their illicit union. His ingenious method was
  to announce that he was about to marry the girl, and then at the last hour
  shot her dead and buried her body. He then disappeared from the
  neighbourhood, and gave out that he and she were secretly wedded and were
  living together at some unknown address.</p>

  <p>The murder was on May 18, 1827, and for some time the plan was completely
  successful, the crime being more effectually concealed because Corder had
  left behind him instructions that the barn should be filled up with stock.
  The rascal sent home a few letters purporting to be from the Isle of Wight,
  explaining that Maria and he were living together in great contentment. Some
  suspicion was aroused by the fact that the postmarks of these letters were
  all from London, but none the less the matter might have been overlooked had
  it not been for the unusual action of an obscure natural law which had
  certainly never been allowed for in Mr. Corder's calculations.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Marten, the girl's mother, dreamed upon three nights running that her
  daughter had been murdered. This in itself might count for little, since it
  may have only reflected her vague fears and distrust. The dreams, however,
  were absolutely definite. She saw in them the red barn, and even the very
  spot in which the remains had been deposited. The latter detail is of great
  importance, since it disposes of the idea that the incident could have arisen
  from the girl having told her mother that she had an assignation there. The
  dreams occurred in March, 1828, ten months after the crime, but it was the
  middle of April before the wife was able to persuade her husband to act upon
  such evidence. At last she broke down his very natural scruples, and
  permission was given to examine the barn, now cleared of its contents. The
  woman pointed to the spot and the man dug. A piece of shawl was immediately
  exposed, and eighteen inches below it the body itself was discovered, the
  horrified searcher staggering in a frenzy out of the ill-omened barn. The
  dress, the teeth, and some small details were enough to establish the
  identification.</p>

  <p>The villain was arrested in London, where he had become, by marriage, the
  proprietor of a girls' school, and was engaged, at the moment of capture, in
  ticking off the minutes for the correct boiling of the breakfast eggs. He set
  up an ingenious defence, by which he tried to prove that the girl had
  committed suicide, but there was no doubt that it was a cold-blooded crime,
  for he had taken not only pistols, but also a pickaxe into the barn. This was
  the view which the jury took, and he was duly hanged, confessing his guilt in
  a half- hearted way before his execution. It is an interesting fact that the
  London schoolmistress, whom he had trapped into marriage by means of a
  specious advertisement in which he described himself as a "private gentleman,
  whose disposition is not to be exceeded," remained devotedly attached to him
  to the end.</p>

  <p>Now here is a case about which there is no possible doubt. The murder was
  unquestionably discovered by means of the triple dream, for which there could
  have been no natural explanation. There remain two psychic explanations. The
  one depends upon telepathy or thought-reading, a phenomenon which, of course,
  exists, as anyone can prove who experiments with it, but which has been
  stretched to most unreasonable lengths by those who would prefer any
  explanation to that which entails disembodied intelligence. It is, of course,
  within the bounds of remote possibility that the murderer thought of the
  girl's mother upon three successive nights and also upon the scene of the
  crime, thus connecting up the vision of one with the brain of the other. If
  any student thinks this the more probable explanation he is certainly
  entitled to accept it. On the other hand, there is a good deal of evidence
  that dreams, and especially early-in-the-morning dreams just before the final
  waking, do at times convey information which seems to come from other
  intelligences than our own. Taking all the facts, I am of opinion that the
  spirit of the dead woman did actually get in touch with the mind of the
  mother, and impressed upon her the true facts of her unhappy fate. It is to
  be remembered, however, that even those who advanced telepathy as an
  explanation of such a case are postulating a power which was utterly unknown
  to science until this generation, and which itself represents a great
  extension of our psychic knowledge. We must not allow it, however, to block
  our way to the further and more important advances which lie beyond it.</p>

  <p>For purposes of comparison we will now take another dream case which is
  perfectly authentic. Upon February 8th, 1840, Edmund Norway, the chief
  officer of the ship <i>Orient</i>, at that time near St. Helena, dreamed a
  dream between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in which he saw his brother
  Nevell, a Cornish gentleman, murdered by two men. His brother was seen to be
  mounted. One of the assailants caught the horse's bridle and snapped a pistol
  twice, but no report was heard. He and his comrade then struck him several
  blows, and dragged him to the side of the road, where they left him. The road
  appeared to be a familiar one in Cornwall, but the house, which should have
  been on the right, came out upon the left in the visual picture. The dream
  was recorded in writing at the time, and was told to the other officers of
  the ship.</p>

  <p>The murder had actually occurred, and the assassins, two brothers named
  Lightfoot, were executed on April 13th of that year, at Bodmin. In his
  confession the elder brother said: "I went to Bodmin on February 8th and met
  my brother ... my brother knocked Mr. Norway down. He snapped a pistol at him
  twice, but it did not go off. He then knocked him down with the pistol. It
  was on the road to Wade-bridge" (the road which had been seen in the dream).
  "We left the body in the water on the left side of the road coming to
  Wadebridge. My brother drew the body across the road to the watering." The
  evidence made it clear that the murder was committed between the hours of ten
  and eleven at night. As St. Helena is, roughly, in the same longitude as
  England, the time of the dream might exactly correspond with that of the
  crime.</p>

  <p>These are the actual facts, and, though they may be explained, they cannot
  be explained away. It appears that Norway, the sailor, had been thinking of
  and writing to his landsman brother just before going to his bunk. This might
  possibly have made the subsequent vision more easy by bringing the two men
  into <i>rapport</i>. There is a considerable body of evidence to prove that
  during sleep there is some part of us, call it the etheric body, the
  subconscious self, or what you will, which can detach itself and visit
  distant scenes, though the cut-off between sleeping and waking is so complete
  that it is very rarely that the memory of the night's experience is carried
  through. I could quote many examples within my own experience of this
  "travelling clairvoyance," as it is called, but one which attracted a good
  deal of attention at the time, as it was fully described in <i>The Times</i>,
  was that of Sir Rider Haggard's dog, the dead body of which was found through
  a vision of the night. The same occurs in the stupor of high fever, and I
  have heard my little son, with a temperature of one hundred and four degrees,
  make a remark in delirium which showed that he saw clearly what had occurred
  in the next room. "Naughty Denis, breaking my soldiers!" were the words, and
  they were absolutely correct. Thus it can easily be conceived that the
  consciousness of the sailor, drawn to his brother by recent loving thoughts,
  went swiftly to him in his sleep, and was so shocked to witness his murder
  that it was able to carry the record through into his normal memory. The case
  would resolve itself, then, into one which depended upon the normal but
  unexplored powers of the human organism, and not upon any interposition from
  the spirit of the murdered man. Had the vision of the latter appeared alone,
  without the accompanying scene, it would have seemed more probable that it
  was indeed a post-mortem apparition. For the next illustration we will turn
  to the records of American crime. In this case, which is absolutely
  authentic, a man named Mortensen owed a considerable sum of money, three
  thousand eight hundred dollars, to a company, which was represented by the
  secretary, Mr. Hay. The transaction occurred in Utah in the year 1901.
  Mortensen beguiled Hay to his private house late in the evening, and nothing
  more was heard of the unfortunate man. Mortensen's story was that he paid the
  money in gold, and that Hay had given him a receipt and had started home with
  the money, carried in glass jars. When the police visited Mortensen's house
  in the morning they were accompanied by Hay's father-in-law, an aged Mormon
  named Sharp, who said: "Where did you last see my son-in-law?"</p>

  <p>"Here," answered Mortensen, indicating a spot outside his door.</p>

  <p>"If that is the last place you saw him," said Sharp, "then that is where
  you killed him."</p>

  <p>"How do you know he is dead?" asked Mortensen.</p>

  <p>"I have had a vision," said Sharp, "and the proof is that within one mile
  of the spot where you are standing, his dead body will be dug up from the
  field."</p>

  <p>There was snow on the ground at the time, and next morning, December 18th,
  a neighbour observed some blood-stains upon it not very far from Mortensen's
  house. They led to a mound shaped like a grave. The neighbour procured a
  spade, borrowing it from Mortensen himself, and speedily unearthed the body
  of Hay. There was a bullet wound at the back of his head. His valuables had
  been untouched, but the receipt which he was known to have carried to
  Mortensen's house afforded sufficient reason for the murder.</p>

  <p>The whole crime seems to have been a very crude and elementary affair, and
  it is difficult to see how Mortensen could have hoped to save himself,
  unless, indeed, an immediate flight was in his mind. There could be no
  adequate defence, and the man was convicted and shot&mdash;the law of Utah
  giving the criminal the choice as to the fashion of his own death. The only
  interest in the affair is the psychic one, for again old Sharp repeated at
  the trial that in a vision he had learned the facts. It is not a very clear
  case, however, and may conceivably have been a bluff upon the part of the old
  man, who had formed his own opinion as to the character of his son-in-law,
  and his probable actions. Such a solution would, however, involve a very
  extraordinary coincidence.</p>

  <p>The next case which I would cite is very much more convincing&mdash;in
  fact, it is final in its clear proof of psychic action, though the exact
  degree may be open to discussion. The facts seem to have been established
  beyond all possible doubt, though there is some slight confusion about the
  date. According to the account of Mr. Williams, of Cornwall, the chief actor,
  it was in the early days of May, 1812, that he thrice in the same night had a
  remarkable dream. Mr. Williams was a man of affairs, and the superintendent
  of some great Cornish mines. He was familiar with the lobby of the House of
  Commons, into which his interests had occasionally led him. It was this lobby
  which he perceived clearly in his dream. His attention was arrested by a man
  in a snuff- coloured coat, with metal buttons, who loitered there. Presently
  there entered a small, brisk man in a blue coat and white waistcoat. As he
  passed, the first man whipped out a pistol and shot the other through the
  breast. In his dream Mr. Williams was made aware that the murdered man was
  Mr. Perceval, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Williams was greatly
  impressed, and alarmed, by this dream, and he recounted it not only to his
  wife but also to several friends whom he met at the Godolphin mine next day,
  asking their advice whether he should go up to London and report the matter.
  To this they answered very naturally, but unfortunately as the event proved,
  that it was useless, and would only expose him to derision. On the
  thirteenth, about ten days after the dream, Mr. Williams narrates how his
  son, returning, from Truro, rushed into the room crying, "Oh, father, your
  dream has come true! Mr. Perceval has been shot in the House of Commons." The
  deed, as is well known, was committed by a man named Bellingham, who had some
  imaginary grievance. The dress of the two chief actors, and all the other
  details, proved to be exactly as foretold.</p>

  <p>In an account in <i>The Times</i> sixteen years later it was stated that
  the vision was upon the actual night of the murder, which would reduce the
  case to ordinary clairvoyance, but the evidence is very strong that it was
  prophetic as well. Mr. Williams, writing in 1832, four years after <i>The
  Times</i> account, repeated the story once more as it is set forth here. His
  wife, his friends at the mine, his projected journey to London, and his
  recollection of his son's arrival with the news all corroborate his version
  of the affair. What comment can we make upon such an incident? Explain it we
  cannot, but at least we can get some light upon it by examining the
  statements of others who have had both the clairvoyant and the prophetic
  faculty. One of these was Swedenborg, who exhibited it again and again, but
  we have no exact account from him as to how his visions came. More to the
  point are the notes of Mr. Turvey, of Bournemouth, a most remarkable psychic,
  whose <i>Beginnings of Seership</i> is one of the most illuminating books I
  know. Our ordinary comments must always be explanations from outside, but
  this gentleman, with his great powers and analytical brain, is able to give
  us more precious information which comes from within. Mr. Turvey was not only
  an extraordinary clairvoyant, capable of throwing out his own etheric body at
  will, and communicating at once to others the information which it brought
  back, but he again and again saw scenes of the future, which he put upon
  record and which frequently, if not invariably, were fulfilled. His
  description of his own sensation is very helpful and destined, I think, to be
  classical. He says:</p>

  <p>"At certain times I see a sort of ribbon moving like the endless belt of a
  cinema film. In colour it is very pale heliotrope, and seems to vibrate very
  rapidly. On it are numerous little pictures, some of which appear to be
  engraved upon the film itself, while others are like pale-blue photographs
  stuck upon the film. The former refer to past, the latter to future events.
  The locality is judged by the scenery and climatic heat" (felt by the
  observer). "The dates are judged by the clearness of the pictures."</p>

  <p>Now, applying this analysis of Mr. Turvey to the far less complete
  experience of Mr. Williams, we get some glimmer of light. Mr. Williams was of
  Welsh or Cornish stock, and predisposed to the psychic. In his busy life he
  could not develop it as Mr. Turvey had done, for the latter, though he was
  once a famous athlete, had broken in health to an extent which confined him
  to his chair. Yet at times his true innate powers could assert themselves,
  and thus he received or perceived one of those cinema visions of which Mr.
  Turvey speaks. Why it should have been sent him is beyond our ken. Was it to
  prompt him to go to London, as he so nearly did, and try to turn the stream
  of fate? Or was it as impersonal as were many of the prophetic visions of Mr.
  Turvey? One cannot say, but there is a big fact standing up as clear as the
  Nelson Column, and to turn away one's eyes, pretend not to see it, and make
  no attempt to fit it into the general scheme of the universe, is neither
  science nor common sense. Mr. Turvey has left it upon record that he saw more
  unpleasant than pleasant things, and Mr. Williams' experience was in
  accordance. This might be taken as supporting the idea that the visions are
  for the purpose of warning and prevention. When one considers that in this
  instance the picture of the lobby of the House of Commons was presented to
  one of the very few men in Cornwall who would recognize the place when they
  saw it, it certainly suggests that the vision did not merely happen, but came
  for a definite purpose. It is not to be denied that this and many other
  prophetic cases strengthen the argument of the fatalist, who holds that our
  Life's path is marked out for us. On the other hand, the student will find a
  certain number of cases which give a comforting assurance, that, though the
  general path may be indicated, there is still a certain play of events which
  gives room for changes in the issue. I have notes, for example, of one dream
  or vision in which the subject had a most clear impression of a long series
  of events, which ended in his going down a coal- mine, the latter experience
  being particularly vivid. Some months afterwards the whole long episode
  occurred exactly as depicted, but when they came to the coal-mine the guide
  said: "I had hoped to take you down the coal-mine, but it is a holiday, and
  the cage is not working." In another case a young officer of my acquaintance
  was warned by a dead comrade that they would meet again upon a certain date.
  The young man spent the day in his dug-out, and late in the evening was
  congratulating himself upon having got through, when about 10 p.m. his
  Company Commander came round and said: "I fear I must ask you to do a rather
  dirty job. We have to find if there are any of our dead near the German wire.
  Take a few men and make an examination." He gave himself up as lost, and his
  batman, who had heard the story, burst into tears. The young fellow was so
  convinced of his own impending fate that he left his party safe in No Man's
  Land, thinking that there was no use in their being sacrificed also. He went
  forward alone, made a perfectly successful search, returned in safety, and
  had no misfortune at all. Such a case must hearten up those who are
  overburdened by any prophecy or presentiment. It may be that some force
  &mdash;prayer, perhaps&mdash;can divert the stream of fate. We shall now turn
  to some cases which were more clearly ultramundane in their nature, and I
  would express my obligation to Mr. Harold Furniss, whose care has restored
  many details in his collection of criminal records. The first which I would
  choose is the murder of Sergeant Davies in the Highlands in the year 1749.
  Davies was part of the English garrison left in the north after the
  suppression of Prince Charlie's rising, and, like many of his comrades, he
  alleviated his exile by the excellent sport which the barren country
  afforded. Upon September 28th in that year he went shooting near Braemar
  without any attendant. The rancour of the recent war had to some extent died
  down, and in any case the sergeant, who was a powerful and determined man,
  feared no opponent. The result showed, however, that he was overbold, as he
  never returned from his expedition. Search parties were sent out, but months
  passed and there were still no signs of the missing soldier. Five years
  passed, and the mystery was still unsolved. At the end of that time, two
  Highlanders, Duncan Terig and Alex. Bain Mac-donald, were arrested because
  the fowling-piece and some of the property of the lost man were found in
  their possession. The case rested mainly, however, upon some evidence which
  was as strange as any ever heard in a court of law.</p>

  <p>A farm labourer named Alex. Macpherson, aged twenty-six, deposed that one
  night in the summer of 1750&mdash;that is, some nine months after the
  sergeant's disappearance&mdash;he was lying awake in the barn where all the
  servants slept, when he saw enter a man dressed in blue, who came to his
  bedside and beckoned him to follow. Outside the door the figure turned and
  said: "I am Sergeant Davies." The apparition then pointed to a distant moss
  or swamp, and said: "You will find my bones there. Go and bury them at once,
  for I can have no peace, nor will I give you any, until my bones are buried,
  and you may get Donald Farquharson to help you." It then vanished.</p>

  <p>Early next day Macpherson, according to his own account, went to the place
  indicated and, obeying the exact instructions received, he came straight upon
  the body, still wearing the blue regimental coat of Guise's Horse. Macpherson
  laid it upon the surface, dragging it out from the slime, but did not bury
  it. A few nights later the vision appeared to him once more as he lay in the
  barn, and reproached him with having failed to carry out the instructions
  given. Macpherson asked: "Who murdered you?"</p>

  <p>To this the apparition answered: "Duncan Terig and Alex. Macdonald," and
  vanished once more. Macpherson next day went to Farquharson and asked him to
  come and help bury the body, to which the latter agreed. It was accordingly
  done. No one else was told of the incident save only one friend, John Grewar,
  who was informed within two days of the burial. This story was certainly open
  to criticism, as the arrest was in 1754, and the alleged apparition and
  subsequent burial in 1750, so that one would naturally ask why no information
  had been given during four years. On the other hand, one could imagine that
  these Celtic Highlanders were somewhat in the position of Irish peasants in
  an agrarian outrage. They were bound together against a common enemy, and
  would not act save under pressure. This pressure arrived when the two
  suspects were actually arrested, the murdered man's gear was found upon them,
  and direct inquiry was made from the folk in the neighbourhood. No ill-will
  was shown to exist between Macpherson and the accused men, nor was any motive
  alleged for so extraordinary a concoction. On the psychic side there are also
  some objections. One would have conceived that the sergeant might return, as
  others seem to have done, in order to identify his murderers, but in this
  case that was a secondary result, and the main one appears to have been the
  burial of his own remains. Spirits are not much concerned about their own
  bodies. In a communication which I saw recently, the deceased alluded to his
  body as "that thing that I used to go about in." Still, earthly prejudices
  die hard, and if Davies, sprung from a decent stock, yearned for a decent
  burial, it would surely not be an unnatural thing.</p>

  <p>There was some corroboration for Macpherson's weird story. There were
  female quarters in this barn, and a woman worker, named Isabel Machardie,
  deposed that on the second occasion of the apparition she saw "something
  naked come in at the door and go straight to Macpherson's bed, which
  frightened her so much that she drew the clothes over her head." She added
  that when it appeared it came in a bowing posture, but she could not tell
  what it was. The next morning she asked Macpherson what it was that had
  troubled them the night before, and he answered that she might be easy, for
  it would trouble them no more.</p>

  <p>There is a discrepancy here between the blue-coated figure of the first
  vision and the "something naked" of the second, but the fact remained that
  the woman claimed to have seem something alarming, and to have alluded to it
  next day. Macpherson, however, could speak nothing but Gaelic, his evidence
  being interpreted to the Court. Lockhart, the defending barrister, naturally
  asked in what tongue the vision spoke, to which Macpherson answered: "In as
  good Gaelic as ever I heard in Lochaber." "Pretty good for the ghost of an
  English sergeant," said Lockhart, and this facile retort made the Court
  laugh, and finally brought about the acquittal of the prisoners, in spite of
  the more material proofs which could not be explained away. Later, both
  Lockhart and the advocate engaged with him, admitted their belief in the
  guilt of their clients.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Davies had fought at Culloden in April, 1746, and met
  his end in September, 1749, so that he had been nearly three and a half years
  in the Highlands, mixing in sport with the gillies, and it is difficult to
  suppose that he could not muster a few simple sentences of their
  language.</p>

  <p>But apart from that, although our information shows that knowledge has to
  be acquired by personal effort, and not by miracle, in the after life, still
  it is to be so acquired, and if Sergeant Davies saw that it was only in a
  Gael that he would find those rare psychic gifts which would enable him to
  appear and to communicate (for every spirit manifestation must have a
  material basis), then it is not inconceivable that he would mastef the means
  during the ten months or so which elapsed before his reappearance. Presuming
  that Macpherson's story is true, it by no means follows that he was the
  medium, since any one of the sleepers in the barn might have furnished that
  nameless atmosphere which provides the correct conditions. In all such cases
  it is to be remembered that this atmosphere is rare, and that a spirit comes
  back not as it would or when it would, but as it can. Law, inexorable law,
  still governs every fresh annexe which we add to our knowledge, and only by
  defining and recognizing its limitations will we gain some dim perception of
  the conditions of the further life and its relation to the present one. We
  now pass to a case where the spirit interposition seems to have been as
  clearly proved as anything could be. It was, it is true, some time ago, but
  full records are still available. In the year 1632 a yeoman named John Walker
  lived at the village of Great Lumley, some miles north of Durham. A cousin
  named Anne Walker kept house for him, and intimacy ensued, with the prospect
  of the usual results. John Walker greatly feared the scandal, and took
  diabolical steps to prevent it. He sent the young woman over to the town of
  Chester-le-Street to the care of one Dame Carr. To this matron Anne Walker
  confessed everything, adding that Walker had used the ominous phrase "that he
  would take care both of her and of her child." One night at Dame Carr's door
  there appeared the sinister visage of Mark Sharp, a Blackburn collier, with a
  specious message which induced the girl to go with him into the dusk. She was
  never seen again. Walker, upon being appealed to by Dame Carr, said that it
  was all right, and that it was better in her condition that she should be
  among strangers. The old lady had her suspicions, but nothing could be done,
  and the days passed on.</p>

  <p>A fortnight later a miller, named James Graham, was grinding corn in his
  mill at night some miles away. It was after midnight when he descended to the
  floor of the mill after putting a fresh fill of corn in the hopper. His exact
  experience, as preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, was as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"The mill door being shut, there stood a woman in the midst of the floor,
  with her hair hanging down all bloody, with five large wounds on her head. He
  being much amazed began to bless himself, and at last asked her who she was
  and what she wanted. She answered, 'I am the spirit of Anne Walker, who lived
  with John Walker... He promised to send me to where I should be well looked
  to ... and then I should come again and keep his house. I was one night sent
  away with Mark Sharp, who, upon a certain moor' (naming the place) 'slew me
  with a pick such as men dig coal with and gave me these five wounds, and
  after threw my body into a coalpit hard by, and hid the pick under a bank,
  and his shoes and stockings being bloody he endeavoured to wash them, but
  seeing the blood would not part he hid them there.'"</p>

  <p>The spirit ended by ordering the miller to reveal the truth on pain of
  being haunted. In this case, as in the last, the message was not delivered.
  The horrified miller was so impressed that he would by no means be alone, but
  he shirked the delicate task which had been confided to him. In spite of all
  his precautions, however, he found himself alone one evening, with the result
  that the vision instantly reappeared, "very fierce and cruel," to use his
  description, and insisted that he should do as commanded. More obdurate than
  the Celtic Macpherson, the miller awaited a third summons, which came in so
  terrific a form in his own garden that his resistance was completely broken
  down, and so, four days before Christmas, he went to the nearest magistrate
  and lodged his deposition. Search was at once made, and the vision was
  justified in all particulars, which, it must be admitted, has not always been
  the case where information has seemed to come from beyond. The girl's body,
  the five wounds in the head, the pick, the bloodstained shoes and stockings
  were all found, and as the body was in a deep coalpit there seemed no normal
  means by which the miller could possibly have known the nature of the wounds
  unless he had himself inflicted them, which is hardly consistent either with
  the known facts, with his appearance as informer, or with the girl's
  admissions to Dame Carr.</p>

  <p>John Walker and Mark Sharp were both arrested and were tried for murder at
  the Durham Assizes before Judge Davenport. It was shown that the miller was
  unknown, save by sight, to either prisoner, so that it could not be suggested
  that he had any personal reason for swearing away their lives by a concocted
  tale. The trial was an extraordinary one, for there seems to have been a
  psychic atmosphere such as has never been recorded in a prosaic British court
  of law. The foreman of the jury, a Mr. Fairbairn, declared in an affidavit
  that he saw during the trial the "likeness of a child standing upon Walker's
  shoulder." This might be discounted as being the effect upon an emotional
  nature of the weird evidence to which he had listened, but it received a
  singular corroboration from the judge, who wrote afterwards to a
  fellow-lawyer, Mr. Serjeant Hutton, of Goldsborough, that he himself was
  aware of a figure such as Fairbairn described, and that during the whole
  proceedings he was aware of a most uncanny and unusual sensation for which he
  could by no means account. The verdict was guilty, and the two men were duly
  executed.</p>

  <p>The array of responsible witnesses in this case was remarkable. There was
  the judge himself, Mr. Fairbairn, with his affidavit, Mr. James Smart, Mr.
  William Lumley, of Great Lumley, and others. Altogether, it is difficult to
  see how any case could be better authenticated, and I have no doubt myself
  that the facts were as stated, and that this single case is enough to
  convince an unprejudiced mind of the continuance of individuality and of the
  penetrability of that screen which separates us from the dead.</p>

  <p>What comment can psychic science make upon such an episode? In the first
  place, I would judge that the miller was a powerful medium&mdash;that is, he
  exuded that rare atmosphere which enables a spirit to become visible as the
  meteorite becomes visible when it passes through the atmosphere of earth. It
  is, I repeat, a rare quality, and in this case seems to have been unknown to
  its possessor, though I should expect to find that the miller had many other
  psychic experiences which took a less public form. This is the reason why the
  apparition did not appear before the magistrate himself, but could only
  approach him by messenger. The spirit may have searched some time before she
  found her medium, just as Sergeant Davies was ten months before he found the
  Highlander who had those physical qualities which enabled him to communicate.
  Law and obedience to law run through the whole subject. It is also abundantly
  evident that the confiding woman who had been treated with such cold-blooded
  ingratitude and treachery carried over to the other world her natural
  feelings of indignation and her desire for justice. As a curious detail it is
  also evident that she recovered her consciousness instantly after death, and
  was enabled to observe the movements of her assassin. With what organs, one
  may ask? With what organs do we see clear details in a dream? There is
  something there besides our material eyes.</p>

  <p>A most reasonable objection may be urged as to why many innocent people
  have suffered death and yet have experienced no super-normal help which might
  have saved them. Any criminologist could name off-hand a dozen cases where
  innocent men have gone to the scaffold. Why were they not saved? I have
  written in vain if I have not by now enabled the reader to answer the
  question himself. If the physical means are not there, then it is impossible.
  It may seem unjust, but not more so than the fact that a ship provided with
  wireless may save its passengers while another is heard of no more. The
  problem of unmerited suffering is part of that larger problem of the
  functions of pain and evil, which can only be explained on the supposition
  that spiritual chastening and elevation come in this fashion, and that this
  end is so important that the means are trivial in comparison. We must accept
  this provisional explanation, or we are faced with chaos.</p>

  <p>Can these dim forces which we see looming above and around us be turned to
  the use of man? It would be a degradation to use them for purely material
  ends, and it would, in my opinion, bring some retribution with it; but, where
  the interests of Justice are concerned, I am convinced that they could indeed
  be used to good effect. Here is a case in point.</p>

  <p>Two brothers, Eugene and Paul Dupont, lived some fifty years ago in the
  Rue St. Honor&eacute; of Paris. Eugene was a banker, Paul a man of letters.
  Eugene disappeared. Every conceivable effort was made to trace him, but the
  police finally gave it up as hopeless. Paul was persevering, however, and in
  company with a friend, Laporte, he visited Mme. Huerta, a well-known
  clairvoyante, and asked for her assistance.</p>

  <p>We have no record as to how far articles of the missing man were given to
  the medium, as a bloodhound was started on a trail, but whether it was by
  psychometry or not, Mme. Huerta, in the mesmerized state, very quickly got in
  touch with the past of the two brothers, from the dinner where they had last
  met. She described Eugene, and followed his movements from the hour that he
  left the restaurant until he vanished into a house which was identified
  without difficulty by her audience, though she was unable to give the name of
  the street. She then described how inside the house Eugene Dupont had held a
  conference with two men whom she described, how he had signed some paper and
  had received a bundle of bank notes. She then saw him leave the house, she
  saw the two men follow him, she saw two other men join in the pursuit, and
  finally she saw the four assault the banker, murder him, and throw the body
  into the Seine.</p>

  <p>Paul was convinced by the narrative, but his comrade, Laporte, regarded it
  as a fabrication. They had no sooner reached home, however, than they learned
  that the missing man had been picked out of the river and was exposed at the
  Morgue. The police, however, were inclined to take the view of suicide, as a
  good deal of money was in the pockets. Paul Dupont knew better, however. He
  hunted out the house, he discovered that the occupants did business with his
  brother's firm, he found that they held a receipt for two thousand pounds in
  exchange for notes paid to his brother on the night of the crime, and yet
  those notes were missing. A letter making an appointment was also
  discovered.</p>

  <p>The two men, a father and son, named Dubuchet, were then arrested, and the
  missing links were at once discovered. The pocket-book which Eugene Dupont
  had in his possession on the night of the murder was found in Dubuchet's
  bureau. Other evidence was forthcoming, and finally the two villains were
  found guilty and were condemned to penal servitude for life. The medium was
  not summoned as a witness, on the ground that she was not conscious at the
  time of her vision, but her revelations undoubtedly brought about the
  discovery of the crime.</p>

  <p>Now it is clear in this authentic case that the police would have saved
  themselves much trouble, and come to a swifter conclusion, had they
  themselves consulted Mme. Huerta in the first instance. And if it is
  obviously true in this case, why might it not be so in many other cases? It
  should be possible at every great police-centre to have the call upon the
  best clairvoyant or other medium that can be got, and to use them freely, for
  what they are worth. None are infallible. They have their off-days and their
  failures. No man should ever be convicted upon their evidence. But when it
  comes to suggesting clues and links, then it might be invaluable. In the case
  of Mr. Foxwell, the London stockbroker who fell into the Thames some years
  ago, it is well known that the mode of his death, and the place where his
  body would be found, were described by Von Bourg, the crystal-gazer, and that
  it was even as he had said. I venture to say that the mere knowledge that the
  police had an ally against whom every cunning precaution might prove
  unavailing would in itself be a strong deterrent to premeditated crime. This
  is so obvious, that if it had not been for vague scientific and religious
  prejudices, it would surely have been done long ago. Its adoption may be one
  of the first practical and material benefits given by psychic science to
  humanity.</p><br>

     id="chap15">SINGULAR RECORDS OF A CIRCLE</a></h2>

  <h3>No magazine publication located<br>
  First book appearance in <i>The Edge Of The Unknown</i>, 1930</h3>

  <p class="first">I have recently received a considerable bundle of records
  from a circle sitting in Uruguay. The sitters consisted of two Englishmen of
  the best class, whom I will call "Hudson." They have given me permission to
  use their real names, but perhaps they hardly realize how considerable the
  backwash might be from such a publication. A lady friend, Miss Reader, is the
  medium, and the procedure is by means of a glass and the alphabet in the
  usual fashion.</p>

  <p>The number of real or alleged spirits that came to this circle and their
  communications have been so clear and direct and present such extraordinary
  variety that they invite comment. After reading their record, which has been
  very well taken, I guarded myself by getting each member of the circle to
  sign a document putting them upon their word of honour that no hoax was
  intended. The elder Mr. Hudson adds: "The way in which spirits of different
  character came through, one after the other, and the unexpectedness and
  spontaneity of the answers with the different styles and phrases would have
  taxed better imaginations than those possessed by any of the three of
  us."</p>

  <p>I particularly inquired whether they had any special acquaintance with the
  English public schools and whether they had done any particular reading as to
  seventeenth or eighteenth-century life. The answer to the first question was
  that they had both been Eton boys, but that they knew nothing of any other
  school, and the answer to the second was that none of them had any particular
  knowledge of the centuries named.</p>

  <p>When I say that among the visitants were two very exuberant public-school
  boys, four ladies of easy virtue, one old sea captain, one Austrian
  adventurer who had been murdered, and a number of bucks from the Regency and
  earlier years, it will be realized that the communications really seemed of
  unusual nature. They were full of points which might be evidential and I have
  taken some trouble to follow these up, sometimes with striking success and
  sometimes with complete failure.</p>

  <p>The first visitant who came on December 18th, 1928, and on several
  subsequent occasions, was one Nicholas, who refused to give his surname. He
  said he had just died, having been shot in Vienna. He was forty-one years of
  age, had lived an evil life and was intensely unhappy in the other world. He
  was born in Baku, had gone to Germany afterwards, as an Austrian he had
  served in the war, against the Russians, had been taken prisoner and sent to
  Siberia, had been liberated by the Communists, but had been arrested by the
  Bolshevists as a spy, not making his escape until 1926. Then he went to
  Vienna, where he had an intrigue with an English girl who had gone there to
  study art. In the course of this intrigue he had been shot, presumably by
  some jealous rival. The story seems to me to hang together fairly well,
  though there is no means of verifying the statements. It is worth noting that
  the sitters had some little difficulty as to where Baku might be, and were
  corrected at once by the visitor.</p>

  <p>The next comer was an exceedingly flighty youth who gave the name of
  Lionel Vereker, but admitted that the surname had not been disclosed. He was
  a practical joker, and his answers to questions are so full of levity,
  sometimes witty and sometimes foolish, that it is difficult to know when one
  is to take him seriously. When his jokes were not appreciated he seems to
  have got sulky. When pressed as to his surname he said, "I think, in the
  excitement of dying, I forgot it." In his more sober moments he said that he
  had been educated at Dulwich and that he left school in the year 1920. When
  asked what house he was at there, he replied, "Alleyne's." I find on
  inquiring, that "Alleyne" was actually the founder of Dulwich College, so
  that this reply was evidential if we accept the assurance of the sitters that
  they had no knowledge of the matter, which I may say I unreservedly do.
  Judging by his high spirits he seemed perfectly happy. He gave the impression
  of being an irresponsible fribble with no great harm in him and no great
  good. I can well believe that there are impersonations at s&eacute;ances if
  Lionel was around. I inquired at Dulwich, but the name could not be
  traced.</p>

  <p>The next visitor, December 29th, 1928, was a very interesting personage.
  This was Harriette Wilson, the famous courtesan of the beginning of last
  century, who numbered among her lovers both the Duke of Wellington and the
  Duke of Argyll. She wrote a volume of Memoirs which show that in spite of her
  profession she was in many ways a woman of fine character. The circle seems
  to have known that such a person existed and also that she wrote Memoirs, so
  to that extent the evidence is weakened. She gives, however, some details
  which have been found on examination to be approximately correct and which
  could hardly have been known by them. She says, for example, that she died a
  hundred years ago. She actually left London in 1826, lived in Paris for a
  short time and then seems to have disappeared. I have often wondered whether
  she had been poisoned. She had promised to write a second book of "Memoirs,"
  mentioning the names of quite a string of people whom she would inculpate.
  The spirit says she was thirty-nine when she died. She was, I think
  thirty-six when she left London. The monologue with her concludes thus:</p>

  <p>Q. "Are you happy?"&mdash;A. "No."</p>

  <p>Q. "Have you others to whom you can talk?"&mdash;A. "Yes" (glass moves
  violently).</p>

  <p>Q. "Don't you like them?"&mdash;A. "No" (furiously).</p>

  <p>Q. "Why?"&mdash;A. "I don't find them to my taste."</p>

  <p>Q. "Do you know us?"&mdash;A. "No, who are you? Interesting?"</p>

  <p>Q. "Have you talked to others on this earth?"&mdash;A. "Yes. Many."</p>

  <p>Q. "Can you materialise?"&mdash;A. "No, I wish I could."</p>

  <p>Q. "Have you got any particular message?"&mdash;A. "No."</p>

  <p>So appeared Harriette after a hundred years. She does not seem to have
  found the peace which some of her kindly actions upon earth deserved.</p>

  <p>The message seems to be evidential unless I could suppose that members of
  the circle in Uruguay had hunted up details which I have had some difficulty
  in getting in London.</p>

  <p>The next visitor was one Catherine Wimpole, who claimed that she had died
  at the age of twelve, one hundred and sixteen years before&mdash;or in 1812.
  She had lived in Clarges Street. It is remarkable that in nearly every case
  the communicator, readily and without hesitation gave the names of streets
  which did exist at that time, and never made any mistake as to the monarch
  who reigned then. There was nothing of a really evidential character from
  Catherine Wimpole, and a Spiritualist must feel surprise that one who died as
  an innocent girl of twelve so long ago had not progressed beyond the somewhat
  mediocre crowd who assembled round this circle.</p>

  <p>The next was a James Kirk, who claimed to have been a gentleman who died
  of an unknown pest in the year 1749 in London. It would be interesting to
  know if the City had any such visitation in that year. When asked who was
  King he at once replied, "George the Second." He said that he lived in a grey
  twilight and was not happy, having none of the luxury to which he was used.
  It was his first return to earth and it gave him pleasure. He said that he
  had been in several spheres, and he asked what London was like now. He said
  that he had been a theatregoer, that his favourite actress was Mrs. Oldfield
  and that he had liked her best in "The Country Wife." He died in Duke Street,
  which is or was out of the Strand. He went often to Court. He named Louis
  Quatorze as King of France, which of course would not be correct at the time
  of Kirk's death, but that great monarch would have filled the years of his
  youth and have left the strongest impression upon his mind, so that the error
  should not be judged too harshly. He was then asked for a statement as to his
  own life and he wrote as follows:</p>

  <p>"I had a full life. More than my share of entertainment; balls, theatres,
  and such diversions. I became enamoured many times to no purpose. I was too
  much like the famous Captain Macheath. (We exclaim at this.) So you also
  know? I was a friend of the Lady Mary Montague. Perhaps you have not heard
  her name? (No.) She was a beautiful woman, brilliant in her own circle. I saw
  the execution of the notorious Jack Sheppard on Tyburn Hill. Did you ever
  hear of Mrs. Cornelys? (No.) She was the owner of a kind of public ball-room
  or rooms. She and her daughter became involved in difficulties and eventually
  disappeared from London, which caused endless idle speculation and gossip. I
  fought two duels; was, I feared, wounded fatally in the second; but as you
  perceive, I did not fare too bad. I frequently travelled to Harrogate,
  Tonbridge and Bath; generally I confess, in quest of the newest aspirant to
  my name. I enjoyed existence; there was much to occupy one's mind. I was
  fond, inordinately fond, of dress. Most of every pleasure I doted upon the
  theatre. I went without fail to the new plays presented."</p>

  <p>Now this reads extraordinarily true. The "Beggar's Opera" was all the
  vogue at the time and Captain Macheath would be a most natural allusion. Mary
  Montague was, of course, as stated and comes within the dates. Jack Sheppard
  was executed at Tyburn in 1724. Finally, Madame Cornelys is excellent. How
  many are there who have heard of her? By a chance note in an old book I found
  that she was the proprietor at that time of a very popular dancing-place at
  the corner of Soho Square, and that she went bankrupt. I think that this
  sequence of correct references is beyond all guess or coincidence and that we
  may take James Kirk at his face value.</p>

  <p>He was fifty-three when he died, so that he was born in 1698. When asked
  if he would come again he replied that he would be "full glad." His health,
  he said, was excellent. "The Cocoa Tree" was his favourite resort upon earth,
  and Mr. Oliver Penberthy of St. James' his best friend. He was at his best
  among the fair sex.</p>

  <p>The next actor upon this curious stage was one David Overman who claimed
  to be an Uppingham boy, but whose name is not upon the School lists. There is
  a mystery in names and possibly some prohibition upon their use in a way
  which would hurt surviving relations. The evidence of the last comer shows
  that even when the name of the communicator may be wrong his allusions are
  quite correct. David Overman was an irresponsible person, very much like
  Lionel Vereker, for whom he professed great contempt. "A perfect fool" was
  his description. Overman left school, according to his account, in 1917, did
  not go to the war, and died at the age of twenty-seven, He seems to have been
  in a cheerful, frivolous sphere. The dialogue runs:</p>

  <p>Q. "Where is Lionel?"&mdash;A. "Off on the gay, I expect."</p>

  <p>Q. "Any ladies there?"&mdash;A. "Plenty. Too many."</p>

  <p>Q. "Are you restricted?"&mdash;A. "Not unreasonably. We can even
  dance."</p>

  <p>Q. "What clothes?"&mdash;A. "Any. I wear a very handsome suit of plus-
  fours."</p>

  <p>Q. "Did you die in them?"&mdash;A. "Yes."</p>

  <p>Q. "Of what?"&mdash;A. "Motor accident. Nasty man. Quick car."</p>

  <p>Q. "Instantly killed?"&mdash;A. "Yes."</p>

  <p>Q. "Where?"&mdash;A. "On the Portsmouth Road between Esher and
  Kingston."</p>

  <p>It would be interesting to know whether in 1927 or 1928 a youth of twenty-
  seven answering to this description was killed in the manner indicated. His
  only other information was that he was attached to "a very natty young
  woman," Betty Matthews, on his side of life. Also that he did not go to the
  University. There is nothing evidential in all this, but the details are
  plausible and possibly some of them may be corroborated.</p>

  <p>The next visitant was Edward Keith of Lincoln, who died in 1870 of small-
  pox, being sixty-four years of age. He said that he found difficulty in
  communicating and he soon stopped. There was no means of checking this
  witness.</p>

  <p>We now come to a very gay young lady with the curious name of Norah
  Sallast. Norah died at the age of nineteen, seventy-eight years ago, which
  takes her back to the middle of last century.</p>

  <p>Q. "Are you happy?"&mdash;A. "No."</p>

  <p>Q. "Why?"&mdash;A. "Life is so monotonous. I hate it" (violently).</p>

  <p>Q. "Is it dark?"&mdash;A. "No, light."</p>

  <p>Q. "Have you anyone to talk to?"&mdash;A. "Yes. I hate it all. You can do
  little to help me. I was wrong in my life."</p>

  <p>Q. "And you suffer for it?"&mdash;A. "Quite enough."</p>

  <p>Q. "Any prospect of happiness?"&mdash;A. "I doubt it."</p>

  <p>Q. "In what way were you wrong?"&mdash;A. "Bad (violently). Rotten all
  through. I could not be thought immoral, as I knew not the meaning of the
  word."</p>

  <p>She then proceeded to give a sketch of her life which was certainly rather
  hectic considering that she died at nineteen. She ran away from school with a
  mysterious man. "He gave me a hell upon earth. I left him and life was a
  series of meetings and separations&mdash;Budapest, Berlin, everywhere
  &mdash;had no money of my own. I was stranded in Sicily and found my way
  home. I lived in London for five years. I was only thirteen when I ran from
  school. I spent two days in Bristol and died there."</p>

  <p>This pitiable story hangs together and yet is incapable of proof. Taking
  it as true it seems a long purgatory for so young a sinner. One could imagine
  that she, like Harriette Wilson, is held until she has realized that the
  seeking of excitement is not the object of life. Had the sitters been
  experienced Spiritualists this would, of course, have been pointed out to
  her, and a new era have, perhaps, been started.</p>

  <p>The next comer was curious, though hard to verify. The name given was Niel
  Hamilton. He was twelve years old when he was drowned at Cuckfield in Sussex,
  more than a century ago. He had been pushed into a duck pond, when playing.
  He said that he was happy, but he gave no reason why he had not progressed
  further in so long a time.</p>

  <p>We now make a big leap backwards and come upon Charles Amor, who died in
  1658, at the age of eighty-one. He had lived at Fleet in Hampshire. When
  asked who was King he answered promptly, "No one. Cromwell." Which, of
  course, is correct but might have stumped some of us. He had gone to Germany,
  his wife had eloped with a German and he had stabbed the man. Possibly this
  hasty temper may have kept him so long in the purgatorial regions. There was
  nothing really evidential.</p>

  <p>The next comer took us further back still. His name was John Castle, who
  died in 1613, at the age of ninety-two. He gave James as the name of the
  King, at which the circle remonstrated, but John Castle proved to be correct.
  This seems an important evidential point, for please do not forget that I
  have the signed word of honour of all concerned that there was no deception.
  I have always found that a British word of honour is worth more than an oath.
  He was a learned man, but was asked frivolous questions by the circle, who
  certainly played down to their visitors and had no idea of the limits of
  spirit power.</p>

  <p>The next was so definite that I had high hopes, but, alas, they came to
  nothing. The name was Laura Yelverton. She died early in 1928 at Torquay. The
  Register, however, in that town failed to trace her. She was thirty-one at
  the time of her death. She claimed that she was born at Chester, went to
  school in Switzerland, lived for years at Arcachon in the South of France,
  lost money, returned to England in 1918, was a married woman. In reference to
  her surroundings she said that, "it is all grey and almost sticky in the
  atmosphere." There were many to whom to talk. She, like the last, seems to be
  in some sort of purgatory. Possibly this account may meet the eye of someone
  who can corroborate. A note to Crowborough would always find me.</p>

  <p>She was immediately succeeded by a man, Mark Lamb, who died in 1725. He,
  at once, said that George the First was on the throne, which is, of course,
  correct but might not be answered by everyone. He was seventy-eight when he
  died and he put his death down to excess in living. He lived in Charles
  Street, London, and was a man of fashion, going to Court. He disliked the
  King. "His character I hated vastly." So I should think&mdash;the coarse
  little boor. Here we have nothing evidential but everything plausible.</p>

  <p>He was at once succeeded by Peter Lamb, a carpenter, who died of a
  poisoned arm at Chatham at the age of fifty in the year 1924. He had nothing
  to say save that he was unfit to go to the war.</p>

  <p>The next spirit seems to have been more intelligent and of a higher grade
  than any of the others. He gave some prophecies which seem to have been
  fairly accurate. Then comes the following:</p>

  <p>Q. "Is it pleasant where you are?"&mdash;A. "Very. I am happy. I have
  interesting companionship."</p>

  <p>Q. "Do you hope to rise higher?"&mdash;A. "I do earnestly."</p>

  <p>Q. "Is there reincarnation?"&mdash;A. "Yes" (violently).</p>

  <p>Q. "Have you risen higher since you died?"&mdash;A. "Yes, twice."</p>

  <p>This is the kind of vital information which we want. As to reincarnation,
  it is clear at any rate that it is at only long intervals, since in three
  centuries he had not himself experienced it.</p>

  <p>The next visitor gave the name of John. He was a half Spaniard who
  interlarded his remarks with Spanish words which were, of course,
  intelligible to the audience. He had been killed some fifty years ago, that
  would mean about 1879, on some steps in Madrid. It was in a fight with a
  rival over a woman. He was very unhappy, "I hate my surroundings." He was
  English on his mother's side. Nothing could be done to help him. His case
  seemed to be a bad one. There was nothing evidential.</p>

  <p>There followed a very sprightly young lady named Willette, who claimed to
  be the girl of that "will of the wisp" Lionel Vereker. She did not like
  proper people. "Life is quite good here." She had died in 1928 in England.
  "What a hole!" she added. She came from Dresden, had red hair and was fond of
  laughing. She had talked to other people at s&eacute;ances, mentioning two
  names, Kenneth Gardner and Ruth Cameron. She was bored with Lionel&mdash;a
  cheerful irresponsible person&mdash;non-evidential.</p>

  <p>The next called himself Peter Morrison, almost certainly using a false
  name if he exists at all. He had died in 1924 in Birmingham, aged forty-one.
  He had been in the war as a Lieut.-Commander in the R.N.V.R. He was on the
  <i>Warspite</i>. Educated at Bradfield, born in Nottingham.</p>

  <p>This was very disappointing, as inquiry both at Bradfield and at the
  Admiralty failed to find any Peter Morrison. Always we seemed to break down
  upon the individual name even when other names were convincingly correct.</p>

  <p>It is noticeable how often they use Christian names only, as if they did
  not desire identification. Thus the next called himself "Robin." He had been
  over two hundred years "a gentleman of much leisure and pleasure. I lived in
  London and Worcester." Asked if he knew James Kirk, who seemed a kindred
  soul, he answered, "No, is he a well-known man?" Robin soon departed. The
  next was also very short. Rose Lonsdale was the name. She had died in early
  Victorian days, aged sixty-four. Her life was uninteresting. She was always
  tired. She could speak a little German because she had a German music master.
  Nothing evidential or instructive.</p>

  <p>The next gave the name of James Welby and he made the comprehensive
  remark, "we live as mortals do." He had died two centuries before at the age
  of fifty-two. Died from a severe cold. When asked who was king he said that
  George the First was on the throne. George I died in 1727, so that would be
  fairly correct. He lived at Salisbury and was a man of leisure. He was born
  in Hampshire. His parents bought him a large house in London or he added, "on
  the outskirts of that noble city. It was just outside of Piccadilly."
  Afterwards he travelled in France and married an Irish lady, named Cecilia
  Abby. When asked the name of his London home he replied, "It had simply the
  name of Dunton House." This place I have been unable to identify. He
  continued, "We went to all entertainments, routs and such frivolous
  amusements. We were blessed with two daughters, one alas, died of small-pox.
  The other married George Fountain. My wife died and I then lived in
  Salisbury, contracted a severe chill and died." The dialogue then ran:</p>

  <p>Q. "Are you happy?"&mdash;A. "Extremely."</p>

  <p>Q. "Are your wife and daughter with you?"&mdash;A. "Yes."</p>

  <p>Q. "And your other daughter?"&mdash;A. "I wish I knew." (This is
  interesting.)</p>

  <p>He was then asked if he knew Robin and he answered he knew Robert Castle
  who often called himself Robin. They suggested that Robin lived in London and
  Worcester, and he replied, "No, this one lived in Cheshire." He then added
  that he was happy and that his surroundings were more or less like the earth
  he knew, but more happy and less troubled.</p>

  <p>There is nothing evidential here, but it is very reassuring to us mortals
  who follow on the trail.</p>

  <p>We now come on Richard Merriman who died in 1560 and is, therefore, the
  oldest spirit of all. Asked who was king at that time, he replied instantly,
  "Queen." "Which one?" they asked. "What other, but our Elizabeth?" He died at
  sea at the age of thirty-five. He caught "the feared disease. Was not able to
  obtain help of any competence. We had no surgeon aboard." Nothing further of
  importance was gathered.</p>

  <p>Then came Katie, who refused to give a second name. She died in 1764. When
  asked who was king, she replied, "George the Second while I lived." This was
  quite correct, as George the Third came on in 1760.</p>

  <p>The accuracy of these historical dates is really a strong point for the
  proof of the reality of these visitors.</p>

  <p>Q. "How old were you?"&mdash;A. "Thirty. A great age for a woman of my
  kind."</p>

  <p>Q. "Were you a woman of easy virtue?"&mdash;"If you care to word it
  thus."</p>

  <p>Q. "Could you tell us the names of some of your lovers."&mdash;A. "Arthur
  Grenville, Will Roberts, Laurence Annaly. There are none worth my
  attention."</p>

  <p>The conversation abruptly broke off. The next witness gave me more trouble
  than any of the others and some disappointment, since I seemed to be
  continually on the edge of what would be evidential and yet never could
  attain it. I was greatly helped by the courtesy of the Secretary of Lloyds'
  Shipping Register. The name given was John Coke. He said that he was a sailor
  and had been drowned eighty years ago in a shipwreck off the Virgin Islands.
  He asked them to pronounce his name as Cook. When asked if he was happy he
  said, "Not very. I miss the sea. It meant a lot to a man like me." Asked if
  any of his old shipmates were with him, he said, "Yes, two, but not my
  friends." "It is very black," he added. "I like light, I like wind and sea
  and salt and sun and sails. I think you do not have many sails now." Buenos
  Aires was a bleak town in his time. He seemed surprised to learn that it was
  now a great city. He was English by birth. Born at a village, Bolderstone in
  Norfolk. (The nearest I could get to that, after long inquiry, was
  Blunderstone.) He was a mate. His ship sailed from Hull to the West Indies.
  They were carrying back a cargo of sugar and fruit. The name of the captain
  was "Molleson." The name of the ship, <i>The Mary of Kintyre</i>, about two
  thousand tons. He was forty and unmarried.</p>

  <p>By search we found that there was a vessel, <i>The Marion Macintyre</i>,
  but the name "Molleson" was not connected with it. There was, however, a
  vessel named <i>Mary</i> with "Morrison" as the master's name, in 1846. Her
  subsequent movements could not be traced. The tonnage seemed to be excessive
  for those days. It has been suggested that "Gorleston" which is a seaside
  village from which a sailor might well originate, is the right name and
  Bolderstone a mistake. This, however, seems a little far-fetched. On the
  whole we must admit that my search has not been successful in identifying
  John Coke.</p>

  <p>Only one other case remains to be examined. It was that of Zoe, a lady of
  light virtue who claims to have met her death two years ago at Tours. She was
  stabbed or shot by her lover. I made some inquiries from a friend at Tours,
  but here again I was unable to verify the facts. Zoe, judging by her
  dialogue, was an amusing and rather impertinent person. Her remarks took the
  form of rather broad chaff of the people in the circle. Once again we have to
  admit there is nothing evidential.</p>

  <p>One very curious thing about this series of cases is the number of them
  who died by violence. Zoe was murdered, John was murdered, Nicholas was
  executed, Overman died in a motor smash, Coke was drowned. The death of
  Harriette Wilson, is in my opinion, extremely doubtful. Therefore quite a
  large proportion of the cases came to their end in an untimely way. Whether
  this determined their presence in the particular stratum which this circle
  seems to have tapped is more than we can say. Apparently it was not one
  stratum alone, since about half of the communicants said that they were happy
  and the other half miserable, half being in light and the other half in
  gloom. Though, of course, in this world we do find happy and unhappy people
  living in close proximity. I give the facts as reported and I give my
  analysis as far as I have been able to make it, and while there is much which
  is unsatisfactory, there is a great deal which is plausible and which was
  entirely outside the knowledge of the circle. It is just possible that this
  publication may bring some fresh evidence on one point or another, and such
  evidence would be very welcome to me. When compared with other such records
  there is enough in common to give us good reason to believe that we are, in
  some sort of dim fashion, gaining an actual glimpse of the conditions of life
  in a certain section of the purgatorial world.</p>
