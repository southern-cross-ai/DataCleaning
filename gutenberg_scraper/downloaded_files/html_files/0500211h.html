  <h2><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">I. &mdash;OUT OF THE PAST</a></h2>

<p class="first">TRUTH is stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>If this tale should seem in part incredible, please bear this
axiom in mind. It had its beginning more than twenty years ago,
unless one wishes to go further back to the first amoeba or even
beyond that to the cosmos shattering clash of two forgotten suns;
but we shall confine our story, other than by occasional
reference, to the stage, the actors, and the business of the
present time.</p>

<p>The searing sun rays scorch down upon a shriveled plain a
scant five degrees north of the equator. A man, clothed in torn
shirt and trousers upon which dried blood has caked and turned a
rusty brown, staggers and falls to lie inert.</p>

<p>A great lion looks down upon the scene from the summit of a
distant rocky ledge where a few tenacious bushes cling to give
shade to the lair of the king; for this is Africa.</p>

<p>Ska, the vulture, wheels and circles in the blue, sky-writing
anticipation far above the body of the fallen man.</p>

<p>Not far to the south, at the edge of the dry plain, another
man swings easily toward the north. No sign of fatigue or
exhaustion here. The bronze skin glows with health, full muscles
glide beneath it. The free gait, the noiseless tread might be
those of Sheeta, the panther; but there is no slinking here. It
is the carriage of one who knows neither doubt nor fear, of a
lord in his own domain.</p>

<p>He is encumbered by but a single garment, a loincloth of doe-
skin. A coil of grass rope is looped over one shoulder, behind
the other hangs a quiver of arrows; a scabbarded knife swings at
his hip; a bow and a short spear complete his equipment. A shock
of black hair falls in disorder above serene, grey eyes, eyes
that can reflect the light of a summer sea or the flashing steel
of a rapier.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Jungle is abroad.</p>

<p>He is far to the north of his ancient haunts, yet this is no
unfamiliar terrain. He has been here many times before. He knows
where water may be had for the digging. He knows where the
nearest water hole lies where he can make a kill and fill his
belly.</p>

<p>He has come north at the behest of an emperor to investigate a
rumor that a European power is attempting to cause the defection
of a native chief by means of bribery. War and rumors of war are
in the air, but of this tale such things are not a part&mdash;we
hope. However, we are no prophet. We are merely a chronicler of
events as they transpire. We follow the activities of our
characters to the bitter end, even to war; but we hope for the
best. However, only time can tell.</p>

<p>As Tarzan swung with easy strides out across the plain, no
sound escaped his keen ears; no moving thing, his eyes; no scent,
borne upon the soft bosom of Usha the wind, went unidentified.
Far in the distance he saw Numa the lion standing upon his rocky
ledge; he saw Ska the vulture circling above something that
Tarzan could not see. In all that he saw or heard or smelled he
read a story; for to him this savage world was an open book,
sometimes a thrilling, always an interesting narrative of love,
of hate, of life, of death.</p>

<p>Where you or I might occasionally pick out a letter or a word,
Tarzan of the Apes grasped the entire text and countless
implications that we might never guess.</p>

<p>Presently, ahead of him, he saw something white shining in the
sunlight&mdash;a human skull; and as he came closer his eyes
picked out the skeleton of a man, the bones only slightly
disarranged. From among them grew a low desert shrub proclaiming
that the skeleton had lain there for a long time.</p>

<p>Tarzan paused to investigate, for to him in his world nothing
is too trivial to pass by without question. He saw that the
skeleton was that of a Negro and that it had lain there for a
long time, years probably; which was entirely possible in this
hot, dry plain. He could not tell how the man had come to his
death, but he guessed that it might have been from thirst.</p>

<p>Then he saw something lying by the bones of a hand, something
half buried by shifting soil; and he stopped and picked it up,
drawing it carefully out of the earth. It was a split stick of
hardwood in the split end of which was wedged a thin parcel of
oiled silk.</p>

<p>The silk was stained and brittle and dry. It seemed that it
might crumble to his touch, but that was only the outer layer. As
he carefully unwrapped it, he found the inner layers better
preserved. Inside the silk wrapper he found what he had
expected&mdash;a letter.</p>

<p>It was written in English in a small, extremely legible hand.
Tarzan read it with interest, interest that was perhaps
stimulated by the date at the top of the sheet. Twenty years had
elapsed since that letter had been written. For twenty years it
had lain here beside the skeleton of its bearer in mute testimony
to the loneliness of this barren plain.</p>

<p>Tarzan read it:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">To Whom This May Come</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">I am dispatching this without much hope
that it will even get out of this damnable country, still less
that it will reach any white man; but if it does, please contact
the nearest Resident Commissioner or any other authority that can
get help to us quickly.</p>

<p class="letter">My wife and I were exploring north of Lake
Rudolph. We came too far. It was the old story. Our boys became
frightened by rumors of a fierce tribe inhabiting the country in
which we were. They deserted us.</p>

<p class="letter">Where the Mafa River empties into the Neubari
we turned up the gorge of the former as though drawn by some
supernatural power, and were captured by the wild women of Kaji,
when we reached the plateau. A year later our daughter was born
and my wife died&mdash;the she-devils of Kaji killed her because
she did not bear a son. They want white men. That is why they
have not killed me and a dozen other white men captives.</p>

<p class="letter">The Kaji country lies on a high plateau above
the falls of the Mafa. It is almost inaccessible, but can be
reached by following the gorge of the Mafa from the Neubari.</p>

<p class="letter">It will require a strong expedition of white
men to rescue me and my little daughter, as I doubt that blacks
can be induced to enter the country. These Kaji women fight like
devils, and they have strange, occult powers of some nature. I
have seen things here that&mdash;well, things that just can't be
but are.</p>

<p class="letter">No native tribes will live near this
mysterious, ill-omened country; so, little is known of the Kaji;
but rumors of their terrifying practices have become part of the
folklore of their nearest neighbors, and it is the hushed recital
of these that frightens the bearers of any safari that comes
within the sphere of their baneful influence.</p>

<p class="letter">The white men may never know the cause of it,
for the blacks fear to tell them, thinking that the black magic
of the Kaji will reach out and destroy them; but the result is
always the same&mdash;if the safari approaches too close to Kaji,
the blacks all desert.</p>

<p class="letter">Then that happens which happened to my wife and
me&mdash;the whites are lured by some mysterious means to the
plateau and made prisoners.</p>

<p class="letter">Perhaps even a large force might be overcome,
for the whites would not be contending against natural forces;
but if they succeeded, the reward might be very great. It is the
hope of this reward that I hold out against the dangers
involved.</p>

<p class="letter">The Kaji own an enormous diamond. Where it came
from, where it was mined, I have been unable to ascertain; but I
suspect that it came from the soil of their own country.</p>

<p class="letter">I have seen and handled the Cullinan diamond,
which weighed over three thousand carats; and I am certain that
the diamond of Kaji weighs fully six thousand. Just what its
value may be I do not know, but using the value of the Brazilian
stone, Star of the South, as a measure, it must be worth close to
£2,000,000&mdash;a reward well worth some risk.</p>

<p class="letter">It is impossible for me to know whether I shall
ever get this letter out of Kaji, but I have hopes of doing so by
bribing one of their black slaves who occasionally leave the
plateau to spy in the lowlands.</p>

<p class="letter">God grant this be delivered in time.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Mountford</span>.</p>

<p><br>
Tarzan of the Apes read the letter through twice. Mountford!
Almost ever since he could remember, it seemed, the mysterious
disappearance of Lord and Lady Mountford had been recalled to the
minds of men by rumors that they still lived, until they had
become a legend of the wilderness.</p>

<p>No one really believed that they lived, yet at intervals some
wanderer from the interior would revive the rumor with more or
less circumstantial evidence. He had had the story from the
chieftain of a remote tribe, or perhaps from the lips of a dying
white man; but there never came any definite clue as to the exact
whereabouts of the Mountfords&mdash;they had been reported from a
score of places all the way from the Sudan to Rhodesia.</p>

<p>And now at last the truth had come, but too late. Lady
Mountford had been dead for twenty years, and it was quite
improbable that her husband still lived. The child must, of
course, have died or been killed by the Kaji. It could scarcely
have survived among those savage people through infancy.</p>

<p>To the jungle bred ape-man death was a commonplace phenomenon
of existence and far less remarkable than many other
manifestations of nature, for it came eventually to all living
things; so the possibility of the death of the man and the child
induced no reaction of sorrow or regret. It simply meant nothing
to him whatsoever. He would deliver the letter to the English
authorities at the first opportunity, and that would be all that
there would be to it. Or so Tarzan thought. He continued his way,
putting the matter from his mind. He was more interested in the
maneuvers of Ska the vulture, for they indicated that Ska was
circling about some creature not yet dead and which, because of
its size or nature, he hesitated to attack.</p>

<p>As Tarzan approached the spot above which Ska wheeled on
static wings he saw Numa the lion drop from the ledge upon which
he had been standing and move cautiously toward the thing that
had aroused the man's curiosity. Though the latter was in plain
sight, Numa seemingly ignored his presence; nor did Tarzan alter
his course because of the lion. If neither changed his pace or
his direction they would meet close to the thing above which Ska
hovered.</p>

<p>As the ape-man came nearer the object of his interest he saw
the body of a man lying in a little natural depression of the
ground&mdash;the body of a white man.</p>

<p>To the right of it, a hundred yards away, was Numa. Presently
the man stirred. He was not dead. He raised his head and saw the
lion; then he struggled to rise, but he was very weak and could
only manage to raise himself to one knee. Behind him was Tarzan,
whom he did not see.</p>

<p>As the man half rose, the lion growled. It was only a warning
in which there was no immediate menace. Tarzan recognized it as
such. He knew that Numa had been attracted by curiosity and not
by hunger. His belly was full.</p>

<p>But the man did not know these things. He thought it was the
end, for he was unarmed and helpless; and the great carnivore,
the king of beasts, was almost upon him.</p>

<p>Then he heard another low growl behind him and, turning his
eyes quickly in that direction, saw an almost naked man coming
toward him. For an instant he did not understand, for he saw no
other beast; then he heard the growl again and saw that it came
from the throat of the bronzed giant approaching him.</p>

<p>Numa heard the growl too and paused. He shook his head and
snarled. Tarzan did not pause; he continued on toward the man.
There was no sanctuary should the lion attack, no tree to offer
the safety of its branches; there were only Tarzan's weapons and
his great strength and his skill; but greatest of all was his
conviction that Numa would not attack.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Jungle well knew the art of bluff and its
value. Suddenly he raised his head and voiced the hideous
warning-cry of the bull ape. The man shuddered as he heard the
bestial cry issue from the lips of a human being. Numa, with a
parting growl, turned and stalked away.</p>

<p>Tarzan came and stood over the man. "Are you hurt?" he
demanded, "or weak from hunger and thirst?"</p>

<p>The voice of a beast coming from the lips of this strange
white giant had been no more disconcerting to the man than now to
hear him speak in English. He did not know whether to be afraid
or not. He glanced hurriedly in the direction of the lion and saw
it moving off in the direction from which it had come, and he was
filled with a new awe of this creature who could frighten the
king of beasts from its prey.</p>

<p>"Well," demanded the ape-man, "do you understand English?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other; "I am an American. I am not hurt. I
have been without food for several days. I have had no water
today."</p>

<p>Tarzan stooped and lifted the man to a shoulder. "We will find
water and food," he said, "and then you may tell me what you are
doing alone in this country."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. &mdash; A STRANGE
TALE</a></h2>

<p class="first">AS Tarzan carried the man toward safety, the
limp, dead weight of his burden told him that his charge had lost
consciousness. Occasionally he mumbled incoherently, but for the
greater part of the journey he was as one dead.</p>

<p>When they came at last to water, Tarzan laid the man in the
shade of a small tree; and, raising his head and shoulders,
forced a few drops of the liquid between his lips. Presently he
could take more, and with its revivifying effects he commenced to
speak&mdash;broken, disjointed, sometimes incoherent snatches of
sentences; as one speaks in delirium or when emerging from an
anesthetic.</p>

<p>"She-devil," he mumbled. "...beautiful...God! how
beautiful." Then he was silent for a while as Tarzan bathed his
face and wrists with the cool water.</p>

<p>Presently he opened his eyes and looked at the ape-man, his
brows wrinkled in questioning and puzzlement. "The diamond!" he
demanded. "Did you get the diamond? Huge&mdash;she must have been
sired by Satan&mdash;beautiful&mdash;enormous&mdash;big
as&mdash;what? It can't be&mdash;but I saw it&mdash;with my own
eyes&mdash;eyes! eyes!&mdash;what eyes!&mdash;but a fiend
&mdash;ten million dollars&mdash;all of that&mdash;big&mdash;big
as a woman's head."</p>

<p>"Be quiet," said the ape-man, "and rest. I will get food."</p>

<p>When he returned, the man was sleeping peacefully and night
was falling. Tarzan built a fire and prepared a brace of quail
and a hare that he had brought down with arrows from his bow. The
quail he wrapped in wet clay and laid in the embers; the hare he
jointed and grilled on sharpened sticks.</p>

<p>When he had done, he glanced at the man and saw that his eyes
were open and upon him. The gaze was quite normal, but the
expression was one of puzzlement.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the man. "What happened? I do not seem to
be able to recall."</p>

<p>"I found you out on the plain&mdash;exhausted," explained
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"O-oh!" exclaimed the other. "You are the&mdash;the man the
lion ran away from. Now I remember. And you brought me here and
got food?&mdash;and there is water, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you have had some. You can have more now. There is a
spring behind you. Are you strong enough to reach it?"</p>

<p>The man turned and saw the water; then he crawled to it. Some
of his strength had returned.</p>

<p>"Don't drink too much at once," cautioned the ape-man.</p>

<p>After the man had drunk he turned again toward Tarzan. "Who
are you?" he asked. "Why did you save me?"</p>

<p>"You will answer the questions," said the Lord of the Jungle.
"Who are you? And what are you doing in this country alone? What
are you doing here at all?"</p>

<p>The voice was low and deep. It questioned, but it also
commanded. The stranger felt that. It was the well modulated,
assured voice of a man who was always obeyed. He wondered who
this almost naked white giant could be. A regular Tarzan, he
thought. When he looked at the man he could almost believe that
such a creature existed outside of story and legend and that this
was, indeed, he.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better eat first," said the ape-man; "then
you may answer my questions." He took a ball of hard baked clay
from the fire, scraping it out with a stick; then with the hilt
of his knife he broke it open, and the baked clay fell away from
the body of the quail, taking the feathers with it. He impaled
the bird on the stick and handed it to the man. "It is hot," he
said.</p>

<p>It was, but the half-famished stranger risked burning for an
initial morsel. Without seasoning, as it was, no food had ever
tasted better. Only its high temperature restrained him from
wolfing it. He ate one quail and half the rabbit before he lay
back, at least partially satisfied.</p>

<p>"To answer your questions," he said, "my name is Wood. I am a
writer&mdash;travel stuff. Thus I capitalize my natural
worthlessness, which often finds its expression and its excuse in
wanderlust. It has afforded me more than a competence; so that I
am now able to undertake expeditions requiring more financing
than a steamer ticket and a pair of stout boots.</p>

<p>"Because of this relative affluence you found me alone and on
the point of death in an untracked wilderness; but though you
found me deserted and destitute without even a crust of bread, I
have here in my head material for such a travel book as has never
been written by modern man. I have seen things of which
civilization does not dream and will not believe; and I have
seen, too, the largest diamond in the world. I have held it in my
hands. I even had the temerity to believe that I could bring it
away with me.</p>

<p>"I have seen the most beautiful woman in the world&mdash;and
the cruelest; and I even had the temerity to believe that I could
bring her away with me, too; for I loved her. I still love her,
though I curse her in my sleep, so nearly one are love and hate,
the two most powerful and devastating emotions that control man,
nations, life&mdash;so nearly one that they are separated only by
a glance, a gesture, a syllable. I hate her with my mind; I love
her with my body and my soul.</p>

<p>"Bear with me if I anticipate. For me she is the beginning and
the end&mdash;the beginning and the end of everything; but I'll
try to be more coherent and more chronological.</p>

<p>"To begin with: have you ever heard of the mysterious
disappearance of Lord and Lady Mountford?"</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded. "Who has not?"</p>

<p>"And the persistent rumors of their survival even now, twenty
years after they dropped from the sight and knowledge of
civilized man?</p>

<p>"Well, their story held for me such a glamour of romance and
mystery that for years I toyed with the idea of organizing an
expedition that would track down every rumor until it had been
proved false or true. I would find Lord and Lady Mountford or I
would learn their fate.</p>

<p>"I had a very good friend, a young man of considerable
inherited means, who had backed some of my earlier
adventures&mdash;Robert van Eyk, of the old New York van Eyks.
But of course that means nothing to you."</p>

<p>Tarzan did not comment. He merely listened&mdash;no shadow of
interest or emotion crossed his face. He was not an easy man in
whom to confide, but Stanley Wood was so full of pent emotion
that he would have welcomed the insensate ears of a stone Buddha
had there been no other ear to listen.</p>

<p>"Well, I gabbled so much about my plans to Bob van Eyk that he
got all hepped up himself; and insisted on going along and
sharing the expenses; which meant, of course, that we could equip
much more elaborately than I had planned to and therefore more
certainly ensure the success of our undertaking.</p>

<p>"We spent a whole year in research, both in England and
Africa, with the result that we were pretty thoroughly convinced
that Lord and Lady Mountford had disappeared from a point on the
Neubari River somewhere northwest of Lake Rudolph. Everything
seemed to point to that, although practically everything was
based on rumor.</p>

<p>"We got together a peach of a safari and picked up a couple of
white hunters who were pretty well familiar with everything
African, although they had never been to this particular part of
the country.</p>

<p>"Everything went well until we got a little way up the
Neubari. The country was sparsely inhabited, and the farther we
pushed in the fewer natives we saw. These were wild and fearful.
We couldn't get a thing out of them about what lay ahead, but
they talked to our boys. They put the fear o' God into 'em.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon we commenced to have desertions. We tried to get
a line on the trouble from those who remained, but they wouldn't
tell us a thing. They just froze up&mdash;scared
stiff&mdash;didn't even admit that they were scared at first; but
they kept on deserting.</p>

<p>"It got mighty serious. There we were in a country we didn't
know the first thing about&mdash;a potentially hostile
country&mdash;with a lot of equipment and provisions and scarcely
enough men to carry on with.</p>

<p>"Finally one of the headmen told me what they were scared of.
The natives they had talked with had told them that there was a
tribe farther up the Neubari that killed or enslaved every black
that came into their territory, a tribe with some mysterious kind
of magic that held you&mdash;wouldn't let you escape, or, if you
did escape, the magic followed you and killed you before you got
back to your own country&mdash;maybe many marches away. They said
you couldn't kill these people because they were not
human&mdash;they were demons that had taken the form of
women.</p>

<p>"Well, when I told Spike and Troll, the white hunters, what
the trouble was, they pooh-poohed the whole business, of course.
Said it was just an excuse to make us turn back because our
carriers didn't like the idea of being so far from their own
country and were getting homesick.</p>

<p>"So they got tough with the boys. Whaled hell out of 'em, and
drove 'em on like slaves. As Spike said, 'Put the fear o' God
into 'em', and the next night all the rest of 'em
deserted&mdash;every last mother's son of 'em.</p>

<p>"When we woke up in the morning there were the four of us, Bob
van Eyk, Spike, Troll, and myself, four white men all alone with
loads for fifty porters; our personal boys, our gun bearers, our
askaris all gone.</p>

<p>"Spike and Troll back-tracked to try to pick up some of the
boys to take us out, for we knew we were licked; but they never
found a one of them, though they were gone for two days.</p>

<p>"Bob and I were just about to pull out on our own when they
got back; for, believe me, if we'd had plenty of it before they
left we'd had a double dose while they were away.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you what it was, for we never saw anyone. Maybe
we were just plain scared, but I don't think that could have been
it. Van Eyk has plenty of nerve, and I have been in lots of tough
places&mdash;lost and alone among the head-hunters of Ecuador,
captured in the interior of New Guinea by cannibals, stood up in
front of a firing squad during a Central American
revolution&mdash;the kind of things, you know, that a travel
writer gets mixed up in if he's really looking for thrills to
write about and hasn't very good sense.</p>

<p>"No, this was different. It was just a <i>feeling</i>&mdash;a
haunting sense of being watched by invisible eyes, day and night.
And there were noises, too. I can't describe them&mdash;they
weren't human noises, nor animal either. They were just noises
that made your flesh creep and your scalp tingle.</p>

<p>"We had a council of war the night Spike and Troll got back.
At first they laughed at us, but pretty soon they commenced to
feel and hear things. After that they agreed with us that the
best thing to do would be to beat it back.</p>

<p>"We decided to carry nothing but a revolver and rifle apiece,
ammunition, and food, abandoning everything else. We were going
to start early the following morning.</p>

<p>"When morning came we ate our breakfasts in silence,
shouldered our packs, and without a word started out <i>up</i> the Neubari. We didn't even look at one another. I don't know about the rest of them, but I was ashamed to.</p>

<p>"There we were, doing just the opposite of the thing we had
decided on&mdash;going deeper and deeper into trouble&mdash;and
not knowing why we were doing it. I tried to exercise my will and
force my feet in the opposite direction, but it was no go. A
power far greater than my own will directed me. It was
terrifying.</p>

<p>"We hadn't gone more than five miles before we came across a
man lying in the trail&mdash;a white man. His hair and beard were
white, but he didn't look so very old&mdash;well under fifty, I
should have said. He seemed pretty well done in, notwithstanding
the fact that he appeared in good physical condition&mdash;no
indication of starvation; and he couldn't very well have been
suffering from thirst, for the Neubari river was less than fifty
yards from where he lay.</p>

<p>"When we stopped beside him, he opened his eyes and looked up
at us.</p>

<p>"'Go back!' he whispered. He seemed very weak, and it was
obviously an effort for him to speak.</p>

<p>"I had a little flask of brandy that I carried for
emergencies, and I made him drink a little. It seemed to revive
him some.</p>

<p>"'For God's sake turn back,' he said. 'There are not enough
of you. They'll get you as they got me more than twenty years
ago, and you can't get away&mdash;you can't escape. After all
these years I thought I saw my chance; and I tried it. But you
see! They've got me. I'm dying. His power! He sends it after you,
and it gets you. Go back and get a big force of white men
&mdash;blacks won't come into this country. Get a big force and
get into the country of the Kaji. If you can kill him you'll be
all right. He is the power, he alone.'</p>

<p>"'Whom do you mean by "he"?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Mafka,' he replied.</p>

<p>"'He's the chief?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'No; I wouldn't know what to call him. He's not a chief, and
yet he's all-powerful. He's more like a witch-doctor. In the dark
ages he'd have been a magician. He does things that no ordinary
witch-doctor ever dreamed of doing. He's a devil. Sometimes I
have thought that he is <i>the</i> Devil. And he is training
her&mdash;teaching her his hellish powers.'</p>

<p>"'Who are you?'</p>

<p>"'I'm Mountford,' he replied.</p>

<p>"'Lord Mountford?' I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"He nodded."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you about the diamond?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>Wood looked at the ape-man in surprise. "How did you know
about that?"</p>

<p>"You rambled a little while you were delirious, but I knew
about it before. Is it really twice the size of the
Cullinan?"</p>

<p>"I never saw the Cullinan, but the Kaji diamond is enormous.
It must be worth ten million dollars at least, possibly more.
Troll used to work at Kimberly. He said somewhere between ten and
fifteen million. Yes, Mountford told us about it; and after that
Troll and Spike were keen on getting into this Kaji country,
hoping to steal the diamond. Nothing Mountford said could deter
them. But after all it made no difference. We couldn't have
turned back if we'd wanted to."</p>

<p>"And Mountford?" asked Tarzan. "What became of him?"</p>

<p>"He was trying to tell us something about a girl. He rambled a
little, and we couldn't quite make out what he was driving at.
His last words were, 'Save her&mdash;kill Mafka.' Then he
died.</p>

<p>"We never did find out whom he meant even after we got into
the Kaji country. We never saw any woman captive. If they had one
they kept her hidden. But then, we never saw Mafka either. He
lives in a regular castle that must have been built centuries
ago, possibly by the Portuguese, though it may have antedated
their excursion into Abyssinia. Van Eyk thought it may have been
built during the Crusades, though what the Crusaders were doing
in this neck of the woods he couldn't explain. At any rate, the
Kaji never built it; though they had done considerable toward
restoring and preserving it.</p>

<p>"The diamond is kept in this castle and is guarded along with
Mafka and the queen by Kaji warriors who are constantly on guard
at the only entrance.</p>

<p>"The Kaji attribute all their powers and the power of Mafka to
the diamond; so naturally they guard it very carefully. For the
stone itself they show no particular reverence. They handle it
and allow others to handle it as though it were quite an ordinary
stone. It is for the queen that they reserve their reverence.</p>

<p>"I am not certain that I correctly fathomed the connection
between the queen and the diamond; but I think that they consider
her the personification of the stone, into whose body has entered
the spirit and the flame of the brilliant.</p>

<p>"She is a gorgeous creature, quite the most beautiful woman I
have ever seen. I do not hesitate to say that she is the most
beautiful woman in the world; but a creature of such radical
contradictions as to cast a doubt upon her sanity. One moment she
is all womanly compassion and sweetness, the next she is a she-
devil. They call her Gonfala, and the diamond Gonfal.</p>

<p>"It was during a moment of her femininity that she helped me
to escape; but she must have repented it, for it could have been
only Mafka's power that reached out and dragged me down. Only she
knew that I had gone; so she must have told him."</p>

<p>"What became of the other three men?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They are still prisoners of the Kaji. When Gonfala helped me
to escape, I planned to come back with a force of whites large
enough to rescue them," Wood explained.</p>

<p>"Will they be alive?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the Kaji will protect them and marry them. The Kaji are
all women. Originally they were blacks who wished to turn white;
so they married only white men. It became a part of their
religion. That is why they lure white men to Kaji&mdash;and
frighten away the blacks.</p>

<p>"This must have been going on for generations, as there is not
an unmixed black among them. They range in color all the way from
brown to white. Gonfala is a blond. Apparently there is not a
trace of Negro blood in her veins.</p>

<p>"If a baby is born black it is destroyed, and all male babies
are destroyed. They believe that the color of the skin is
inherited from the father."</p>

<p>"If they kill all the males, where do they get their
warriors?"</p>

<p>"The women are the warriors. I have never seen them fight; but
from what I heard I imagine they are mighty ferocious. You see,
we walked right into their country like long-lost friends, for we
didn't want to fight 'em. All two of us wanted was their diamond,
Bob van Eyk wanted adventure, and I wanted material for another
book. If we could make friends, so much the better.</p>

<p>"That was six months ago. Bob has had adventure and I have
material for a book, though much good it will ever do me. Spike
and Troll haven't the diamond, but they each have seven Kaji
wives&mdash;all properly married, too, by Gonfala in the presence
of the great diamond.</p>

<p>"You see, Gonfala, as queen, selects the wives for all
captured whites; but she herself is not allowed to marry.</p>

<p>"This allotting of the whites is more or less of a racket. The
women make offerings to Gonfala, and the ones who make the most
valuable offerings get the husbands.</p>

<p>"Well, we saw a lot of Gonfala. She seemed to take a liking to
Bob and me, and I sure took a liking to her. In fact, I fell in
love with her, and even after I guessed the truth I didn't
care.</p>

<p>"She liked to hear about the outside world, and she'd listen
to us by the hour. You know how people are. Seeing so much of her
and being near her broke down my revulsion for her cruelties; so
that I was always mentally making excuses for her. And all the
time I kept on loving her more and more, until finally I told
her.</p>

<p>"She looked at me for a long time without saying a word. I
didn't know whether she was sore or not. If you knew what a big
shot the queen of the Kaji is, you'd realize how presumptuous I
was in declaring my love. She's more than a queen; she's a sort
of deity that they worship&mdash;all mixed up with their worship
of the diamond.</p>

<p>"'Love,' she said in a little, low voice. 'Love! So that is
what it is!'</p>

<p>"Then she straightened up and became suddenly very regal. 'Do
you know what you have done?' she demanded.</p>

<p>"'I have fallen in love with you,' I said. 'That is about all
I know or care.'</p>

<p>"She stamped her foot. 'Don't say it,' she commanded. 'Don't
ever say it again. I should have you killed; that is the penalty
for daring to aspire to the love of Gonfala. She may not love;
she may never marry. Do you not understand that I am a goddess as
well as a queen?'</p>

<p>"'I can't help that,' I replied. 'And I can't help loving you
any more than <i>you can help loving me!</i>'</p>

<p>"She gave a little gasp of astonishment and horror. There was
a new expression in her eyes; it was not anger; it was fear. I
had voiced a suspicion that I had had for some time, and I had
hit the nail on the head&mdash;Gonfala was in love with me. She
hadn't realized it herself until that very moment&mdash;she
hadn't known what was the matter with her. But, now she did, and
she was afraid.</p>

<p>"She didn't deny it; but she told me that we would both be
killed, and killed horribly, if Mafka suspected the truth. And
what she was afraid of was that Mafka would know because of his
uncanny powers of magic.</p>

<p>"It was then that she decided to help me escape. To her it
seemed the only way to insure our safety; to me it presented an
opportunity to effect the rescue of my friends with the
possibility of persuading Gonfala to come away with me if I were
successful.</p>

<p>"With her help, I got away. The rest you know."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. &mdash; THE POWER OF
MAFKA</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE ape-man had listened patiently to Stanley
Wood's recital. How much he could believe of it, he did not know;
for he did not know the man, and he had learned to suspect that
every civilized man was a liar and a cheat until he had proved
himself otherwise.</p>

<p>Yet he was favorably impressed by the man's personality, and
he had something of the wild beast's instinctive knowledge of
basic character&mdash;if it may be called that. Perhaps it is
more an intuitive feeling of trust for some and distrust of
others. That it is not infallible, Tarzan well knew; so he was
cautious, always. And in that again the beast showed in him.</p>

<p>"And what do you propose doing now?" he asked.</p>

<p>Wood scratched his head in perplexity. "To be perfectly frank,
I don't know. I am confident that Mafka found out that I had
escaped and that it was his magic that followed and brought me
down. Perhaps Gonfala told him. She is a Jekyll and Hyde sort of
person. In one personality she is all sweetness and tenderness,
in another she is a fiend.</p>

<p>"As far as my future actions are concerned, I have a very
definite premonition that I am not a free agent."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Since it commenced to get dark haven't you felt an invisible
presence near us, haven't you sensed unseen eyes upon us, and
heard things, and almost seen things? These are the
manifestations of Mafka. We are in his power. Where he wills us
to go, we'll go; and you can lay to that."</p>

<p>A shadow of a smile moved the lips of the Lord of the Jungle.
"I have seen and heard and sensed many things since we stopped
here, but none of them was Mafka. I have identified them all
either through my ears or my nose. There is nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"You do not know Mafka," said Wood.</p>

<p>"I know Africa, and I know myself," replied the ape-man,
simply. There was no bravado in his tone, but absolute assurance.
It impressed the American.</p>

<p>"You are a regular Tarzan," he said.</p>

<p>The other shot a quick glance at him, appraising. He saw that
the man spoke without knowledge of his identity, and he was
satisfied. His mission required that he remain unknown, if
possible. Otherwise, he might never gain the information he
sought. He had felt safe from recognition, for he was unknown in
this district.</p>

<p>"By the way," continued Wood. "You have not told me your name.
I have seen so many unbelievable things since I came into this
country that not even the sight of an evidently highly civilized
man wandering almost naked and alone in a wilderness surprised me
as much as it otherwise might have. Of course, I don't want to
pry into your affairs, but naturally my curiosity is aroused. I
wonder who you are and what you are doing here." He stopped
suddenly and looked intently at Tarzan. His eyes registered
suspicion and a shadow of fear. "Say!" he exclaimed. "Did Mafka
send you? Are you one of his&mdash;his creatures?"</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head. "You are in a most unfortunate
situation," he said. "If I were not one of Mafka's
<i>creatures</i>, or if I were, my answer, quite conceivably,
might be the same&mdash;I should deny it; so why answer you? You
will have to find out for yourself, and in the meantime you will
have to trust me or distrust me as seems wisest to you."</p>

<p>Wood grinned. "I am up against it, ain't I?" He shrugged.
"Well, we're both in the same boat. At least you don't know any
more about me than I do about you. I may have been giving you a
cock-and-bull story. I admit it must sound fishy. But at least I
told you my name. You haven't told me that much about yourself
yet. I don't know what to call you."</p>

<p>"My name is Clayton," said the ape-man. He might also have
said, John Clayton Lord Greystoke&mdash;Tarzan of the Apes; but
he didn't.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to get out of this country," said Tarzan,
"and get help for your friends."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, but there isn't a chance now."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Mafka&mdash;Mafka and Gonfala."</p>

<p>"I can't take you out at present," said the ape-man, ignoring
the implied obstacle. "You may come along to the Lake Tana
country with me if you wish to. You'll get a story there&mdash;a
story that you must never write. You'll have to give me your word
as to that. My only alternative is to leave you here. You will
have to decide."</p>

<p>"I'll come with you," said Wood, "but neither of us will ever
reach Lake Tana." He paused and strained his eyes into the
lowering dusk of the brief twilight. "There!" he said in a
whisper. "It's back; it's watching us. Don't you hear it? Can't
you feel it?" His voice was tense, his eyes slightly dilated.</p>

<p>"There is nothing," said Tarzan. "Your nerves are upset."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me you don't hear it&mdash;the moaning, the
sighing?"</p>

<p>"I hear the wind, and I hear Sheeta the panther a long way
off," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear those, too; but I hear something else. You must
be deaf."</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled. "Perhaps," he said. "But go to sleep; you need
rest. Tomorrow you will not hear things."</p>

<p>"I tell you I hear it. I almost see it. Look! There, among
those trees&mdash;just a shadow of something that has no
substance."</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "Try to sleep," he said. "I will
watch."</p>

<p>Wood closed his eyes. The presence of this quiet stranger gave
him a feeling of security despite his conviction that something
weird and horrible hovered there in the darkness&mdash;watching,
always watching. With the dismal keening still ringing in his
ears, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>For a long time Tarzan sat in thought. He heard nothing other
than the usual night noises of the wilderness, yet he was
sufficiently conversant with the mystery and the magic of black
Africa to realize that Wood had heard something that he could not
hear. The American was intelligent, sane, experienced. He did not
seem the type to be carried away by imaginings or hysteria. It
was just possible that he was under the spell of hypnotic
suggestion&mdash;that Mafka could project his powers to great
distances. This was rather borne out by the evidence that Tarzan
had had presented to him within the past few hours: the death of
Mountford's messenger twenty years before, the striking down of
Wood within a short distance of the same spot, the death of
Mountford for no apparent good reason upon the very threshold of
escape.</p>

<p>Mafka's was indeed a sinister power, but it was a power that
the ape-man did not fear. All too often had he been the object of
the malign necromancy of potent witch-doctors to fear their
magic. Like the beasts of the jungle, he was immune. For what
reason he did not know. Perhaps it was because he was without
fear; perhaps his psychology was more that of the beast than of
man.</p>

<p>Dismissing the matter from his mind, he stretched and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>The sun was half a hand-breadth above the horizon when Wood
awoke. He was alone. The strange white man had disappeared.</p>

<p>Wood was not greatly surprised. There was no reason why this
stranger should wait and be burdened by a man he did not know,
but he felt that he might at least have waited until he was awake
before deserting him and leaving him prey for the first lion or
leopard that might chance to pick up his scent.</p>

<p>And then there was Mafka. The thought aroused questions in the
mind of the American. Might not this fellow who called himself
Clayton be a tool of the magician of the Kaji? The very fact that
he denied that he had heard any strange sounds or sensed any
unusual presence lent color to this suspicion. He must have
heard; he must have sensed. Then why did he deny it?</p>

<p>But perhaps he was not Mafka's spy. Perhaps he had fallen a
victim to the sorcery of the old Devil. How easy it would have
been for Mafka to lure him away. Everything seemed easy for
Mafka. He could have lured him away to captivity or destruction,
leaving Wood to die as Mafka intended&mdash;alone by
starvation.</p>

<p>Wood had never seen Mafka. To him he should have been no more
than a name; yet he was very real. The man even conjured an image
of him that was as real and tangible as flesh and blood. He saw
him as a very old and hideous black man, bent and wrinkled. He
had filed, yellow teeth, and his eyes were close-set and blood-
shot.</p>

<p>There! What was that? A noise in the trees! The thing was
coming again!</p>

<p>Wood was a brave man, but things like these can get on the
nerves of the bravest. It is one thing to face a known danger,
another to be constantly haunted by an unseen thing&mdash;a
horrible, invisible menace that one can't grapple with.</p>

<p>The American leaped to his feet, facing the direction of the
rustling among the foliage. "Come down!" he cried, "Come down,
damn you, and fight like a man!"</p>

<p>From the concealing foliage a figure swung lightly to the
ground. It was Tarzan. Across one shoulder he carried the carcass
of a small buck.</p>

<p>He looked quickly about. "What's the matter?" he demanded. "I
don't see anyone." Then a faint smile touched his lips. "Hearing
things again?" he asked.</p>

<p>Wood grinned foolishly. "I guess it's sort of got me," he
said.</p>

<p>"Well, forget it for a while," counseled the ape-man. "We'll
eat presently; then you'll feel better."</p>

<p>"You killed that buck?" demanded Wood.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked surprised. "Why, yes."</p>

<p>"You must have killed it with an arrow. That would take an
ordinary man hours&mdash;stalk an antelope and get close enough
to kill it with an arrow."</p>

<p>"I didn't use an arrow," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Then how did you kill him?"</p>

<p>"I killed him with my knife&mdash;less danger of losing an
arrow."</p>

<p>"And you brought him back through the trees on your shoulder!
Say, that bird Tarzan has nothing on you. How did you ever come
to live this way, Clayton? How did you learn to do these
things?"</p>

<p>"That is a long story," said Tarzan. "Our business now is to
grill some of this meat and get on our way."</p>

<p>After they had eaten, Tarzan told the other to carry some of
the meat in his pockets. "You may need food before I can make
another kill," he said. "We'll leave the rest for Dango and
Ungo."</p>

<p>"Dango and Ungo? Who are they?"</p>

<p>"The hyena and the jackal."</p>

<p>"What language is that? I never heard them called that before,
and I am a little bit familiar with a number of native
dialects."</p>

<p>"No natives speak that language," replied the ape-man. "It is
not spoken by men."</p>

<p>"Who does speak it, then?" demanded Wood; but he got no reply,
and he did not insist. There was something mysterious about him,
and that in his mien and his manner of speech that discouraged
inquisitiveness. Wood wondered if the man were not a little mad.
He had heard of white men going primitive, living solitary lives
like wild animals; and they were always a little bit demented.
Yet his companion seemed sane enough. No, it was not that; yet
undeniably the man was different from other men. He reminded Wood
of a lion. Yes, that was it&mdash;he was the personification of
the strength and majesty and the ferocity of the lion. It was
controlled ferocity; but it was there&mdash;Wood felt it. And
that, perhaps, was why he was a little afraid of him.</p>

<p>He followed in silence behind the bronzed white savage back up
the valley of the Neubari, and as they drew closer to the country
of the Kaji he felt the power of Mafka increasing, drawing him
back into the coils of intrigue and sorcery that made life
hideous in the land of the women who would be white. He wondered
if Clayton felt it too.</p>

<p>They came at length to the junction of the Mafa and the
Neubari. It was here, where the smaller stream emptied into the
larger, that the trail to the Kaji country followed up the gorge
of the Mafa. It was here that they would have to turn up the
Mafa.</p>

<p>Tarzan was a few yards in advance of Wood. The latter watched
him intently as he came to the well-marked forking of the trail
to the right leading to the crossing of the Neubari and up the
Mafa. Here, regardless of his previous intentions, he would have
to turn toward Kaji. The power of Mafka would bend his will to
that of the malign magician; but Tarzan did not turn&mdash;he
continued upon his way, unperturbed, up the Neubari.</p>

<p>Could it be that Mafka was ignorant of their coming? Wood felt
a sudden sense of elation. If one of them could pass, they could
both pass. There was an excellent chance that they might elude
Mafka entirely. If he could only get by&mdash;if he could get
away somewhere and organize a large expedition, he might return
and rescue Van Eyk, Spike, and Troll.</p>

<p>But could he get by? He thought of the invisible presence that
seemed to have him under constant surveillance. Had that been
only the fruit of an overwrought imagination, as Clayton had
suggested?</p>

<p>He came then to the forking of the trails. He focused all his
power of will upon his determination to follow Clayton up the
Neubari&mdash;and his feet turned to the right toward the
crossing that led up the Mafa.</p>

<p>He called to Clayton, a note of hopelessness in his voice.
"It's no go, old man," he said. "I've got to go up the
Mafa&mdash;Mafka's got me. You go on&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>Tarzan turned back. "You really want to go with me?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course, but I can't. I tried to pass this damnable trail,
but I couldn't. My feet just followed it."</p>

<p>"Mafka makes strong medicine," said the ape-man, "but I think
we can beat him."</p>

<p>"No," said Wood, "you can't beat him. No one can."</p>

<p>"We'll see," said Tarzan, and lifting Wood from the ground he
threw him across a broad shoulder and turned back to the Neubari
trail.</p>

<p>"You don't feel it?" demanded Wood. "You don't feel any urge
to go up the Mafa?"</p>

<p>"Only a strong curiosity to see these people&mdash;especially
Mafka," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"You'd never see him&mdash;no one does. They're afraid someone
will kill him, and so is he. He's pretty well guarded all the
time. If one of us could have killed him, most of the Kaji's
power would be gone. We'd all have had a chance to escape. There
are about fifty white prisoners there. Some of them have been
there a long time. We could have fought our way out, if it hadn't
been for Mafka; and some of us would have come through
alive."</p>

<p>But Tarzan did not yield to his curiosity. He moved on toward
the North with an easy grace that belied the weight of the burden
across his shoulder. He went in silence, his mind occupied by the
strange story that the American had told him. How much of it he
might believe, he did not know; but he was inclined to credit the
American with believing it, thus admitting his own belief in the
mysterious force that enslaved the other mentally as well as
physically; for the man seemed straightforward and honest,
impressing Tarzan with his dependability.</p>

<p>There was one phase of the story that seemed to lack any
confirmation&mdash;the vaunted fighting ability of the Amazonian
Kaji. Wood admitted that he had never seen them fight and that
they captured their prisoners by the wiles of Mafka's malign
power. How, then, did he know that they were such redoubtable
warriors? He put the question to the American.</p>

<p>Whom did they fight?</p>

<p>"There is another tribe farther to the East," explained Wood,
"across the divide beyond the headwaters of the Mafa. They are
called Zuli. Once the Kaji and the Zuli were one tribe with two
medicine-men, or witch-doctors, or whatever you might call them.
One was Mafka, the other was a chap called Woora.</p>

<p>"Jealousy arose between the two, causing a schism. Members of
the tribe took sides, and there was a battle. During the fracas,
Woora swiped one of the holy fetishes and beat it, telling some
of his followers where he was going and to join him when the
fight was over. You see, like the people who cause civilized
wars, he was not taking part in it personally.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that this other fetish that he lifts is the
complement of the great diamond, the Gonfal, of the Kaji. United,
their power is supreme; but separated, that of each is greatly
reduced. So the Kaji and the Zuli are often battling, each
seeking to obtain possession of the fetish of the other.</p>

<p>"It was the stories of the raids and skirmishes and battles
for these prizes, as told me by Gonfala and others of the Kaji,
that gave me the hunch that these ladies are pretty mean
warriors. Some of the yarns I've heard were sure tall; but the
scars of old wounds on most of them sort of bear them out, as do
the grisly trophies that hang from the outer walls of Gonfala's
palace&mdash;the shriveled heads of women, suspended by their
long hair.</p>

<p>"An interesting feature of the story is the description of the
fetish of the Zuli&mdash;a green stone as large as the Gonfal and
as brilliant. It glistens like an emerald; but, holy cats! Think
of an emerald weighing six thousand carats! That would be
something worth battling for, and they don't know the value of
it."</p>

<p>"Do you?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Well, no, not exactly&mdash;perhaps twenty million dollars at
a rough guess."</p>

<p>"What would that mean to you&mdash;luxuries and power? The
Kaji probably know little of luxuries; but, from what you have
told me, power is everything to them; and they believe that this
other fetish would give them unlimited power, just as you think
that twenty million dollars would give you happiness.</p>

<p>"Probably you are both wrong; but the fact remains that they
know quite as well the value of it as you, and at least it does
less harm here than it would out in the world among men who would
steal the pennies from the eyes of the dead!"</p>

<p>Wood smiled. This was the longest speech that his strange
companion had vouchsafed. It suggested a philosophy of life that
might make an uninhabited wilderness preferable to contacts of
civilization in the eyes of this man.</p>

<p>For an hour Tarzan carried the American; then he lowered him
to his feet. "Perhaps you can go it on your own now," he
said.</p>

<p>"I'll try. Come on!"</p>

<p>Tarzan started again along the trail toward the North. Wood
hesitated. In his eyes and the strained expression of his face
was reflected the stupendous effort of his will. With a groan of
anguish he turned and started briskly toward the South.</p>

<p>The ape-man wheeled and hastened after him. Wood glanced back
and broke into a run. For an instant Tarzan hesitated. The fellow
meant nothing to him; he was a burden. Why not let him go and be
relieved of him? Then he recalled the terror in the man's face
and realized, also, the challenge that Mafka was hurling at the
Lord of the Jungle.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the latter that motivated him more strongly
than aught else when he started in pursuit of the fleeing
American.</p>

<p>Mafka's power might be unquestionably great, but it could not
lend sufficient speed to the feet of Stanley Wood to permit him
to outdistance the ape-man. In a few moments Tarzan overhauled
and seized him. Wood struggled weakly to escape at the same time
that he was thanking Tarzan for saving him.</p>

<p>"It's awful," he groaned. "Don't you suppose I can ever escape
from the will of that old devil?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "Perhaps not," he said. "I have known
ordinary witch-doctors to kill men after a period of many years
at distances of hundreds of miles, and this Mafka is evidently no
ordinary witch-doctor."</p>

<p>That night they camped beside the Neubari, and in the morning
when the ape-man awoke Stanley Wood had disappeared.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. &mdash; SENTENCED TO
DEATH</a></h2>

<p class="first">WITH the realization that the American had gone
there came to Tarzan a fuller realization of the potency of
Mafka's necromancy; for he did not for a moment doubt that it was
the influence of the Kaji magician that had forced the desertion
of the unwilling Wood.</p>

<p>The ape-man conceded admiration to the cunning and the power
that had stolen the man from him, for he had taken particular
pains to circumvent just such a possibility. When they had lain
down to sleep, Tarzan had fastened one end of his grass rope
securely to an ankle of the man he had taken under his protection
and the other end to one of his own wrists; but that upon which
he had depended most was his own preternatural keenness of sense
which ordinarily functioned only a little less actively when he
slept than when he was awake.</p>

<p>That Wood had been able to free himself and escape could have
been due to no powers of his own; but must have been attributable
solely to the supernatural machinations of Mafka, constituting in
the eyes of the ape-man a direct challenge to his own
prowess.</p>

<p>Perhaps this motivated him in part, but it was also a desire
to save the young American from an unknown fate that prompted him
to turn back in pursuit.</p>

<p>He did not follow the back trail to the Mafa River, but struck
out in a south-easterly direction into the mountainous country
that forms an almost impregnable protection for the stronghold of
the Kaji.</p>

<p>Deep gorges and precipitous cliffs retarded the progress of
the ape-man; so that it was over three days before he reached his
objective: a point near the headwaters of the Mafa a full day's
march to the east of the City of Kaji.</p>

<p>He had foreseen that Mafka might expect him to follow Wood,
which would offer the magician an opportunity to have Tarzan
waylaid and destroyed at some point upon the trail where he would
be helpless against the onslaught of a well-placed detachment of
Kaji warrior-women; and so he had elected to come upon Kaji from
an unexpected direction and depend upon his animal cunning and
his great strength and agility to carry him into the very
presence of the malign power the destruction of which appeared to
be the only means whereby Wood and his companions might be set at
liberty permanently.</p>

<p>But above all, his success depended upon the verity of his
conviction that he was immune to the supernatural powers of
Mafka; though upon this point there was one thing that troubled
him; it seemed to him that Mafka must have known of his
befriending of Wood. The very fact that he had taken Wood from
him suggested that. Yet this might have been accomplished by
means of spies, which the American had specifically stated were
employed by the Kaji. There was also the possibility that Mafka's
power over his victims was so great that he could read their
minds even at great distances and thus see through their eyes the
things that they saw; so that while Tarzan had been in the
company of the American, Mafka had been as well aware of him and
his activities as though he had been present in person; but when
Wood was no longer with him, the magician could not exercise his
telepathic surveillance over him. This was the premise upon which
the ape-man based his strategy.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the third day after Wood's
disappearance that Tarzan paused upon a lofty mountain ridge and
surveyed the country about him. In a canyon below and to the
south of him raced a turbulent mountain stream. With his eyes he
followed its meanderings toward the west where, in the dim and
hazy distance, he saw a cleft in the serried range that he knew
must be the gorge of the Mafa leading down to its confluence with
the Neubari.</p>

<p>He stood, then, near the headwaters of the former stream
between the countries of the Kaji and the Zuli.</p>

<p>A west wind blew gently from the lower country toward the
summit of the range, carrying to the nostrils of the ape-man
evidence of things unseen&mdash;of Tongani the baboon, Sheeta
the leopard, of the red wolf, and the buffalo; but of the east he
had no knowledge except that which his eyes and his ears
furnished; and so, facing the west, he was unaware of the eyes
that watched him from behind the summit of the ridge above him,
eyes that disappeared when the ape-man turned in their
direction.</p>

<p>There were a dozen pairs of them, and their owners formed a
motley crew of unkempt, savage warriors. Of them, seven were
bearded white men and five were blacks. All were similarly garbed
in well worn loin-cloths of the skins of wild beasts. They
carried bows and arrows and short, heavy spears; and all the
blacks and some of the whites wore barbaric
ornaments&mdash;necklaces of the teeth of animals and armlets and
anklets. Upon their backs were small shields of the hide of the
buffalo.</p>

<p>They watched Tarzan as he descended into the gorge of the Mafa
and slaked his thirst. They saw him take a piece of meat from his
quiver and eat, and every move that he made they watched.
Sometimes they spoke together in low whispers that could not
carry against the wind to the ears of the ape-man.</p>

<p>One, who seemed to be the leader, spoke most often. He was a
white man whose brown hair had grayed at the temples and whose
beard was streaked with grey. He was well built, with the hard
leanness of the athlete. His forehead and his eyes denoted
intelligence. His companions called him Lord.</p>

<p>Tarzan was tired. For three days he had scaled cliffs and
crags, descended into abysses, and clambered to lofty summits;
and the previous night his rest had been broken by hunting
leopards that had caught his scent and stalked him. He had killed
one that had attacked him; but others had kept him constantly on
the alert, precluding the possibility of continued rest.</p>

<p>The sun was still an hour high when he lay down to sleep
behind a bush on the slope above the Mafa. That he was dog-tired
must account for that which followed, for ordinarily nothing
could have approached without arousing him.</p>

<p>When he did awaken, it was still daylight; and a dozen
warriors formed a close circle about him, the points of their
spears directed at his unprotected body. He looked up into the
savage, unfriendly eyes of a black man; then he glanced quickly
around the circle and noted the composition of the group. He did
not speak. He saw that he was outnumbered and a captive. Under
the circumstances there was nothing that he could say that would
serve him any purpose.</p>

<p>His silence and his composure set his captors aback. They had
expected him to show fear and excitement. He did neither. He just
lay there and appraised them through steady, grey eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Kaji," said Lord at last, "we've got you."</p>

<p>The truth of the statement was too obvious to require comment;
so Tarzan remained silent. He was interested less in what the man
said than in the language in which he said it. The fellow
appeared definitely Anglo-Saxon, yet he spoke a bastard tongue
the base of which was Galla but so intermixed with other tongues
that it would have been unintelligible to one less versed in
African dialect and European languages than Tarzan. In his brief
speech, that could be translated into six English words, he had
used as many tongues.</p>

<p>Lord shifted his weight from one foot to the other. "Well,
Kaji," he said after a brief silence, "what have you got to
say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Get up!" directed Lord.</p>

<p>Tarzan arose and stretched with the easy indifference of a
lion in its own lair.</p>

<p>"Take his weapons," snapped Lord; and then, half to himself
and in English: "By Jove, but he's a rum 'un."</p>

<p>Then, indeed, was Tarzan interested. Here was an Englishman.
There might be some reason to speak now&mdash;to ask
questions.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded. "What makes you think that I'm a
Kaji?"</p>

<p>"For the same reason that you know that we are Zuli," replied
Lord. "Because there are no other people in these mountains."
Then he turned to one of his fellows. "Tie his hands behind his
back."</p>

<p>They led him then across the ridge and down the other side of
the divide; but it was dark now, and Tarzan saw nothing of the
country through which they passed. He knew that they followed a
well worn trail that often dropped precipitously down the side of
a rocky gorge until it reached a gentler descent and wound
tortuously as though following the meanderings of the stream that
splashed or purled or gurgled at their right.</p>

<p>It was very dark in the gorge; but at length they came out
into open, level country; and there it was lighter; though still
no landmarks were visible to give the ape-man a suggestion of the
terrain of this unfamiliar land.</p>

<p>A dim, flickering light showed far ahead. For half an hour
they approached it before its closer aspect explained it. Then
Tarzan saw that it was from an open fire burning behind the
stockade of a village.</p>

<p>As they approached the gates, Lord hallooed; and when he had
identified himself they were admitted, and Tarzan found himself
in a village of stone huts thatched with grass. The light from
the fire burning in the center of the main street revealed only a
portion of the village, which evidently was of considerable size;
the rest was lost in the shadows beyond the limit of the
firelight.</p>

<p>Before him, built directly across the principal avenue, loomed
a large two-storied stone building. At the village gate were
several women garbed and armed similarly to his captors. In the
none-too-brilliant light of the fire they appeared to be white
women; and there were others, like them, lounging in the doorways
of huts or about the fire. Among them were a number of white men;
and all of them, but especially the women, evinced considerable
interest in Tarzan as Lord led him through the village.</p>

<p>"Ai, Kaji!" they yelled at him. "You will soon be dead,
Kaji."</p>

<p>"It is too bad he is a Kaji," shouted one woman. "He would
make a fine husband."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Woora will give him to you," bantered another, "when
he gets through with him."</p>

<p>"He will be no good for a husband then. I do not want lion
meat for a husband."</p>

<p>"I hope Woora feeds him to the lions alive. We have had no
good sport since before the last rains."</p>

<p>"He will not turn this one to the lions. The fellow has too
good a head. He looks as though he might have brains, and Woora
never wastes good brains on the lions."</p>

<p>Through this barrage of comment, Lord led his captive to the
entrance to the big building that dominated the village. At its
portals were a dozen warrior-women, barring entrance. One of them
advanced to meet Lord, the point of her spear dropped to the
level of the man's abdomen.</p>

<p>Lord halted. "Tell Woora that we bring a Kaji prisoner," he
said.</p>

<p>The woman turned to one of her warriors. "Tell Woora that Lord
brings a Kaji prisoner," she directed; then her eyes travelled
over the ape-man appraisingly.</p>

<p>"A good specimen, eh?" said Lord. "What a fine mate he'd make
for you, Lorro."</p>

<p>The woman spat reflectively. "M-m-m, yes," she agreed; "he has
good conformation, but he is a little too dark. Now, if one were
sure he had nothing but white blood, he'd be well worth fighting
for. Do you suppose he's all white? But what's the difference?
He's a Kaji, and that's the end of him."</p>

<p>Since his capture Tarzan had spoken only a few words, and
these in the Gallic dialect. He had not denied that he was a Kaji
for the same reason that he had made no effort to escape:
curiosity prompted him to learn more of the Zuli&mdash;curiosity
and the hope that he might learn something of advantage from
these enemies of the Kaji that would aid him in freeing the two
Americans and their companions from captivity and releasing them
permanently from the malign power of Mafka.</p>

<p>As he waited before the entrance to the palace of Woora he
decided that he was rather enjoying the adventure. The frank
appraisal of Lorro amused him. The idea of a woman fighting for
possession of him appealed to his sense of humor. At the time he
did not know exactly what the woman's words connoted, but he made
a shrewd guess based on what Wood had told him of the customs of
the Kaji.</p>

<p>Indifferently he appraised the woman. She might have been an
octoroon, or she might have been a white woman with a coat of
tan. Her features were not Negroid. Except for her dark hair she
might have passed easily for a Scandinavian. She was a well-
formed woman of about thirty, clean limbed and with the muscular
contours of an athlete rendered graceful by femininity. Her
features were good, and by any civilized standards she would have
been accounted a handsome woman.</p>

<p>The ape-man's reflections upon the subject were interrupted by
the return of the warrior Lorro had sent to advise Woora of
Lord's return with a prisoner.</p>

<p>"Lord is to take the Kaji to Woora," she announced. "See that
the prisoner bears no weapons, that his hands are tied behind
him, and that a strong guard accompanies him and Lord&mdash;a
guard of women."</p>

<p>With six of her warriors, Lorro escorted Lord and his prisoner
into the palace, a palace only by virtue of its being occupied by
a ruler&mdash;a palace by courtesy, one might say.</p>

<p>They entered a gloomy hall lighted dimly by a burning wick in
a shallow pottery dish, a primitive cresset that gave forth more
soot than light. Upon either side of the corridor were doorways,
across most of which were drawn hangings fashioned from the pelts
of animals, mostly buffaloes.</p>

<p>One uncovered doorway revealed a chamber in which a number of
warrior-women were congregated. Some lay on low, skin-covered
cots; others squatted in a circle upon the floor intent upon some
game they were playing. The walls of the room were hung with
spears and shields and bows and arrows. It was evidently a guard-
room. Just beyond it, the corridor ended before a massive door
guarded by two warriors.</p>

<p>It was evident that the guards were expecting the party and
had received their instructions, for as they approached the doors
were swung open for them to enter.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw before him a large room at the far end of which a
figure was seated upon a dais. Two score or more of smoking
cressets lighted the interior, revealing walls hung with a
strange array of skins, weapons, rugs, silks, calicoes&mdash;a
veritable museum, Tarzan conjectured, of the loot of many a
safari; but by far the most outstanding and impressive feature of
the decorations was the frieze of human heads that encircled the
chamber&mdash;the mummified heads of women, hanging by their
long hair, while from the smoke-darkened beams of the ceiling
depended a hundred more.</p>

<p>These things the eyes of the ape-man took in in a sweeping
glance; then they returned to the dais and the figure upon it. A
score of women warriors flanked the dais where the lone figure
sat upon a huge throne chair.</p>

<p>At first glance Tarzan saw only an enormous head thatched with
scraggly grey hair; and then, below the head, a shrivelled body
that was mostly abdomen&mdash;a hideously repulsive figure, naked
but for a loin cloth. The skin of the face and head were drawn
like yellow parchment over the bones of the skull&mdash;a living
death's head in which were set two deep, glowing eyes that
smoldered and burned as twin pits of Hell. And Tarzan knew that
he was in the presence of Woora.</p>

<p>On a table directly in front of the magician rested an
enormous emerald that reflected the lights from the nearer
cressets and shot them back in scintillant rays that filled the
apartment with their uncanny light.</p>

<p>But it was the man rather than the emerald that interested
Tarzan. Woora was no black man, yet it was difficult to determine
to what race he might belong. His skin was yellow, yet his
features were not those of a Chinese. He might have been almost
anything.</p>

<p>For several minutes he sat staring at Tarzan after the latter
was halted before the dais. Gradually an expression of puzzlement
and frustration overspread his face; then he spoke.</p>

<p>"How is my brother?" he demanded, the words squeaking like a
rusty hinge.</p>

<p>The expression on Tarzan's face revealed no emotion, though
inwardly he was greatly puzzled by the question.</p>

<p>"I do not know your brother," he replied.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Woora. "You mean to tell me, Kaji, that you
do not know that prince of liars, that thief, that murderer, that
ingrate, my brother?"</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head. "I do not know him," he repeated,
"and I am no Kaji."</p>

<p>"What!" screamed Woora, glaring at Lord. "This is no Kaji?
Didn't you tell me you were bringing a Kaji?"</p>

<p>"We captured him near the headwaters of the Mafa, O Woora; and
what other kind of man would be there but a Kaji?"</p>

<p>"He is no Kaji, fool," said Woora. "I guessed as much the
moment I looked into his eyes. He is not as other men. My putrid
brother could have no power over this one. You are a fool, Lord;
and I have no wish to breed more fools among the Zuli&mdash;there
are enough already. You will be destroyed. Take his weapons from
him, Lorro. He is a prisoner."</p>

<p>Then he turned to the ape-man. "What were you doing in the
country of the Zuli?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Searching for one of my people who is lost."</p>

<p>"You expected to find him here?"</p>

<p>"No, I was not coming here. I was going into the country of
the Kaji."</p>

<p>"You are lying," snapped Woora. "You could not come to the
headwaters of the Mafa without coming through the country of the
Kaji; there is no other way."</p>

<p>"I came another way," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No man could cross the mountains and gorges that surround
Kaji and Zuli; there is no trail except that up the Mafa River,"
insisted Woora.</p>

<p>"I crossed the mountains and the gorges," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I see it all!" exclaimed Woora. "You are no Kaji; but you are
in the service of my loathsome brother, Mafka. He has sent you
here to murder me."</p>

<p>"Well," he laughed mockingly, "we shall see who is more
powerful, Mafka or I. We shall see if he can save his servant
from the wrath of Woora. And we'll give him time." He turned to
Lorro. "Take him away with the other prisoner," he directed, "and
see that neither of them escapes&mdash;especially this one; he is
a dangerous man. But he will die even as Lord will."</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. &mdash; THE BLACK
PANTHER</a></h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN and Lord were confined in a room on the
second floor of the palace of Woora. It was a small room with a
single window heavily barred with wooden bars. The door was thick
and solid, and secured upon the outside with heavy bars.</p>

<p>When the guard had closed and bolted the door and departed,
Tarzan walked to the window and looked out. The moon had risen
and the light clouds that had overcast the sky earlier in the
night had disappeared.</p>

<p>In the soft glow of the night light, the ape-man saw a walled
compound directly beneath the window; and in the shadow of the
wall something that was unrecognizable by sight, yet Tarzan knew
what it was from the scent that rose to his nostrils. He took
hold of the bars and tested them; then he turned back and faced
Lord.</p>

<p>"If you had asked me," he said, "I should have told you that I
was not a Kaji; then you wouldn't have been in this mess."</p>

<p>Lord shook his head. "It was only an excuse to kill me," he
said. "Woora has been waiting for one. He is afraid of me. The
men are more important here than they are in the Kaji country. We
are allowed to bear arms and be warriors. That is because Woora
knows that we cannot escape, as the only route to the outer world
lies through the country of the Kaji. They would make slaves of
us or kill us.</p>

<p>"Woora has heard that some of the men have banded together for
the purpose of escaping. The plan included assassinating Woora
and stealing the great emerald, which is supposed to be the
source of his magic power. With this emerald, which Mafka craves
more than anything in the world, we hoped to bribe our way
through and out of the Kaji country.</p>

<p>"Woora believes that I am the instigator of the plot, and so
he wants to destroy me. Of course, he could do that at any time
he wishes, but he is a wily old devil and is trying to hide the
fact that he has any suspicions. In this way he hopes to trap all
of the plotters eventually, killing them one by one on one
pretext or another."</p>

<p>"How can you know so much of his plans?" demanded the ape-
man.</p>

<p>"Even in this land of horror and iniquity there is sometimes
love," replied Lord, "and there is always lust. A woman close to
Woora is honestly in love with one of us. Woora has talked too
much to her&mdash;that is all. He is supposed to be above
temptations of the flesh, but he is not.</p>

<p>"But now everything is spoiled. The others will be afraid.
They will stay on until they die."</p>

<p>"You are an Englishman, aren't you?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>Lord nodded. "Yes," he said; "I was an Englishman, but God
only knows what I am now. I've been here twenty years&mdash;here
and in Kaji. The Kaji caught me originally; then the Zuli got me
in one of their raids."</p>

<p>"I thought Woora killed the Kaji he caught," said the ape-man.
"He was going to have me killed because he thought I was a Kaji,
or at least I assumed he was from what I heard after we reached
the city."</p>

<p>"Yes, he kills them all now because we have all the men we
need; but in those days there were not enough men. We can only
support a limited number of people. There's plenty of meat, for
game is plentiful; but fruits and vegetables are scarce. As it
is, we breed more than enough to keep up the population&mdash;in
fact, too many. Most of the babies are killed. Then, too, the
women are pretty white. That is what they have been breeding for
for God knows how many generations; so there isn't much need for
new white blood. It's very rare now that a baby is born with
Negroid characteristics, but of course occasionally there is a
throwback."</p>

<p>"Why do they want to be white?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The Lord only knows. They never see anyone but themselves and
never will. The original reason is lost in the past&mdash;dead
with those who conceived it. Unless, perhaps, Woora and Mafka
know. It is said they have been here forever&mdash;that they are
deathless; but of course that is not true.</p>

<p>"I have a theory about them that is based upon various
snatches of information that I have picked up during the past
twenty years. They are identical twins who came from Columbia
many years ago bringing with them the great emerald, which they
probably stole. How they came into possession of the Gonfal of
the Kaji, I don't know. Doubtless they murdered someone who was
trying to get out of the country with it.</p>

<p>"That they have uncanny occult powers there is no doubt, and
the very fact that they believe these dependent upon the great
diamond of the Kaji and the emerald of the Zuli may very probably
have caused this to be true; so if either Mafka or Woora were
deprived of his stone his power would be lost. But killing them
would make it surer. We were taking no chances; we were going to
kill Woora. But now, as far as I am concerned, the dream is over.
I'll go to the lions; you'll be tortured to death."</p>

<p>"Why the difference?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I'll furnish sport for Woora in the lion yard, but he won't
risk you. They might tear you to pieces, head and all; and Woora
wants your brain. I'm sure of that."</p>

<p>"Why does he want it?"</p>

<p>"You had him guessing; I could see that, and he figures that
any one who can do that must have a pretty good brain; so he
wants it."</p>

<p>"But why?" insisted the ape-man.</p>

<p>"To eat."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Tarzan. "He believes that if one eats the
part in which another excels one acquires a measure of this
excellence. I have seen it before, often. A warrior eats the
heart of a brave enemy to increase his own courage, or the soles
of the feet of a swift runner to accelerate his own speed, or the
palms of the hands of a clever artisan."</p>

<p>"It is all rot," said Lord.</p>

<p>"I do not know," admitted Tarzan. "I have lived in Africa all
my life, and there are many things that I have learned not to
deny simply because I do not understand them. But there is one
thing that I guess."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"That Woora will not eat my brain; nor will you go to the
lions if you care to escape."</p>

<p>"Escape!" scoffed Lord. "There is no escape."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," admitted the ape-man. "I said only that I
guessed; I did not say that I knew."</p>

<p>"How can we escape?" demanded Lord. "Look at that door; see
the bars on that window, and below the window&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The panther," Tarzan concluded for him.</p>

<p>"How did you know a panther was there?" Lord's tone bespoke
incredulity.</p>

<p>"The scent of Sheeta is strong," replied the ape-man. "I
noticed it the instant I came into this room, and when I went to
the window I knew that he was in the compound beneath&mdash;a
male panther."</p>

<p>Lord shook his head. "Well, I don't know how you did it; but
you're right."</p>

<p>Tarzan walked to the window and examined the bars and the
casing in which they were set.</p>

<p>"Stupid," he said.</p>

<p>"What is stupid?" asked Lord.</p>

<p>"Whoever designed this. Look." He seized two of the bars close
to the sill and surged backward with all his strength and all his
weight. There was a rending of wood as the entire window frame
was torn from its seat; then he laid the frame with all its bars
upon the floor of the room.</p>

<p>Lord whistled. "Man!" he exclaimed. "You're strong as a bull;
but don't forget the panther, and the noise'll probably bring the
guard."</p>

<p>"We'll be ready for them," Tarzan assured him. He had seized
the window frame again, and a moment later he had torn it apart.
The bars fell from their sockets. Tarzan picked up two of them
and handed one to Lord. "These will make fair weapons," he
said.</p>

<p>They waited in silence for a while, but no guard came.
Apparently only the panther had been disturbed. He was growling
now; and when they went to the window, they saw him standing in
the center of the compound looking up at them. He was a large
beast and coal black.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to his companion. "Could you get away if we got
outside the city?" he asked. "Or has Woora the same power to
direct the movements of his victims at a distance that Mafka
has?"</p>

<p>"There's the rub," admitted Lord. "That's the reason we'd
planned on killing him."</p>

<p>"How does he stand with the Zuli? Are they loyal to him?"</p>

<p>"The only hold he has upon them is based on terror. They fear
and hate him."</p>

<p>"The women, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, every one."</p>

<p>"What would happen here if he were dead?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The blacks and whites who are prisoners and slaves would
combine with the women in an attempt to fight our way out into
the outer world. The blacks and whites (they are all men) want to
get back to their own homes. The women, the true Zuli, have heard
so much about the world they have never seen that they want to
get out, too. They know from what the whites have told them that
they would be rich from the proceeds of the sale of the great
emerald; and while they have no first-hand knowledge of money,
they have learned enough from the white men here to understand
that it will get them everything their hearts
desire&mdash;especially more white men. Here, each of the whites
is married to anywhere from seven to a dozen Zuli women because
there are so few of us; so the height of the ambition of every
Zuli is to have a husband of her own."</p>

<p>"Why don't they kill Woora themselves, then?"</p>

<p>"Fear of his supernatural powers. Not only would they not kill
him themselves, they would protect his life from others; but when
he was once dead, then it would be different."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Tarzan. "Where does he sleep?"</p>

<p>"In a room directly behind his throne," replied Lord. "But
why? Why do you ask? You're not&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I am going to kill him. There is no other way."</p>

<p>Lord shook his head. "It can't be done. Man, he is almost as
powerful as God and almost as omniscient. But anyway, why are you
doing it?"</p>

<p>"One of my countrymen is a prisoner among the Kaji. With the
help of the Zuli, I can set him free with all the rest of the
Kaji prisoners. I am not so sure that I could do it alone. It
would be difficult to get into Mafka's presence. He is more
afraid and more careful than Woora."</p>

<p>"You haven't got into Woora's presence yet, except with your
hands tied behind you," Lord reminded him.</p>

<p>"Is there any way to get into his room except from the throne-
room?"</p>

<p>"There is a way, but you can't get in. Woora's room has a
window looking onto this compound below us. The panther is there
to guard Woora as well as to keep prisoners from escaping. You
would have to pass through the compound to get to the
window."</p>

<p>"That is not so good," mused the ape-man. "I'd have to make
too much noise. I'd certainly arouse Woora by breaking the bars
at his window."</p>

<p>"There are no bars there."</p>

<p>"But the panther! What's to keep him from entering and killing
Woora?"</p>

<p>"Woora has even greater power over the panther than he has
over us humans. He can control the beast's every act."</p>

<p>"You are sure there are no bars at the window?" demanded
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Absolutely sure, and the window is always open so that Woora
can call the panther to him if he is ever in danger of
attack."</p>

<p>"Excellent! I'll go in by the window."</p>

<p>"You insist on forgetting the panther."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten him. Tell me something of Woora's
habits. Who is with him? When does he arise? Where does he eat?
When does he first go into the throne-room?"</p>

<p>"No one is with him in his sleeping room, ever. No one, as far
as we know, has ever been in it, other than himself. His
breakfast is handed in to him through a small opening near the
floor on the side of the room opposite the throne-room. He gets
up shortly after sunrise and eats immediately thereafter. He has
a suite of three rooms. What he does there, only the Devil knows.
Sometimes he has one of the women warriors come into one of his
rooms. They never tell what they see there, or what happens. They
are too terrified. What would be perhaps an hour after his
breakfast, he comes into the throne-room. By this time many of
the Zuli have congregated there. Charges are heard, punishments
are meted out, the business of the day is attended to. That is,
hunting parties and raiding parties are sent out; directions are
given for the planting, cultivation, or harvesting of crops.
Reports and complaints are listened to by Woora. Then he goes
back to his apartments and remains there until the evening meal
which he takes in the throne-room. That is his day, unless
something unforeseen occurs such as the examination of a captive
brought in unexpectedly, as you were."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the ape-man. "Everything can be made to
conform to my plan."</p>

<p>"Except the panther," said Lord.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," conceded Tarzan; "we'll see." He
stepped to the window. The panther had quieted down and was lying
once more in the shade of the compound wall. Tarzan listened.
Presently he turned to his companion. "He is asleep," he said;
then he threw a leg over the sill.</p>

<p>"You are not going down there!" Lord exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why not? It is the only avenue to Woora, and the panther
sleeps."</p>

<p>"He will not be asleep for long."</p>

<p>"I do not expect him to be. I only ask him to stay asleep
until I am squarely on my feet below there."</p>

<p>"It is suicide," said Lord, "and nothing to be gained by
it."</p>

<p>"Maybe, but let's wait and see." He threw the other leg over
the sill; then he turned upon his belly. In his right hand was
one of the heavy bars he had taken from the window. Cautiously,
silently, he slipped down until he hung from the sill by one
hand.</p>

<p>Lord watched him, breathless. He saw the fingers slip
gradually from their hold on the sill; then he looked out. The
man had alighted erect and then turned like lightning to face the
panther, but the beast had not moved. It still slept.</p>

<p>Tarzan crept toward it, silent as the shadow of Usha the wind.
The ape-man had covered half the distance to the panther when the
beast awoke; then, before it could gather its wits the man leaped
toward it.</p>

<p>In the window above, Lord held his breath. He could not but
admire the courage of his fellow prisoner, but he thought him
foolhardy. Just then the panther charged.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI. &mdash; TRAPPED</a></h2>

<p class="first">OF all the cats none bears so evil a reputation
as the panther. His ferocity is proverbial, his wiliness uncanny,
the force and fury of his attack demoniacal. But all these things
the ape-man knew and was prepared for. He had weighed his chances
with the panther against his chances with Woora, and he had
chosen the lesser of two evils first in the belief that thus he
might rid himself of both. And now in a few seconds his judgment
would be vindicated, or he would be dead.</p>

<p>The black beast charged with all the fury of its kind, and it
charged in silence. No growls disturbed the deathly stillness of
the night. A serene moon looked down upon the village of the
Zuli, and beyond the confines of the compound there was no
warning of death.</p>

<p>Lord looked down upon the swift tragedy with something of
contempt for the stupidity that would permit a man to throw his
life away uselessly, and from another window two deep-set,
glowing eyes watched above snarling lips&mdash;watched from the
window of the room that was Woora's.</p>

<p>Grasping the hardwood rod in both hands, Tarzan swung it above
his head in a great circle that started low at his right side,
timing it to the fraction of a second so that it met the panther
with its full momentum, backed by the strength of the ape-man's
giant thews, at the height of the beast's speed.</p>

<p>Full upon the fierce, flat skull it fell before the protracted
talons or bared fangs could reach the flesh of the panther's
intended prey. There was the sound of splintering wood and bone,
the thud of the heavy body upon the hard ground, then
silence.</p>

<p>Lord drew in his breath in a quick gasp. Although he had seen
the thing with his own eyes, he could scarcely believe. The eyes
at Woora's window were filled with a sudden fear&mdash;with fear
and cunning. They watched intently to see what the next move of
the strange prisoner would be.</p>

<p>Tarzan placed a foot upon the carcass of his kill and raised
his face to Goro the Moon. Just for an instant he stood thus, but
no victory cry of the bull ape shocked the silence of the night
to warn his enemies that he was abroad. Then he moved in the
direction of the window that opened into the room of Woora, the
magician; and as he did so, the eyes receded into the darkness of
the interior.</p>

<p>The ape-man paused at the open window while his ears and his
nostrils searched the dark chamber. His ears heard a faint
rustling sound as of the scuffing of sandaled feet upon a floor
and the almost silent closing of a door. His nostrils caught
clearly the scent of Woora.</p>

<p>Placing a hand upon the sill, Tarzan vaulted silently into the
room. He stood in silence, listening, in one hand the splintered
remains of the hardwood rod. He heard no sound, not even the
faintest sound of breathing that his ears would have detected had
there been another in the room. He concluded, then, that Woora
had seen him coming and that the slight noises he had heard had
been caused by the magician's departure. Now he must be doubly on
his guard.</p>

<p>Lord had told him that there were three rooms in Woora's
suite. There was also the throne-room adjoining. To which room
had the man fled? Had he gone to summon help? This was probable,
yet Tarzan heard no sound to indicate that anyone was coming.</p>

<p>The faint moonlight dissipated but slightly the darkness of
the room, yet it was enough for the keen eyes of the ape-man as
they became accustomed to the gloom. He advanced noiselessly into
the apartment, and presently he saw a door in the wall before him
and another at his right. The latter, he judged, must lead into
the throne-room. He approached the other and found the latch.</p>

<p>Noiselessly he pulled the door toward him, keeping partially
behind it to shield himself from a surprise blow or a missile.
The room was dark as a pocket. He listened intently but heard
nothing. His nostrils told him that Woora had been there
recently, but his ears assured him that he had
gone&mdash;probably into the farthest apartment.</p>

<p>He stepped into the room, bent upon searching the next and
last. He knew that Woora had come this way and that he would find
him beyond the next door. He felt something beneath his feet that
felt like cords laid upon the floor. Instantly he was
suspicious&mdash;the suspicion of the wild animal that senses a
trap.</p>

<p>He started to retreat to the room he had just
quitted&mdash;but too late. Cords sprang up around him. They
pulled at him and tripped him, so that he fell. Then he felt them
closing and tightening about him. He struggled to escape them,
but they were everywhere. He was entangled in a mesh of
cords.</p>

<p>The door of the third room opened letting in light. In the
doorway stood Woora, a cresset in his hand. His death's head face
was contorted in a snarling grin. Behind the magician, Tarzan
caught a glimpse of a room that might have been the laboratory of
a medieval alchemist but for the grisly array of human heads that
depended from the beams of the ceiling.</p>

<p>The apartment was lighted by several cressets, and upon a
table in the center lay the great emerald of the Zuli, radiating
its weird and baleful light, so that the entire chamber was
filled with a seemingly palpable essence that was, in some way,
mysteriously malign.</p>

<p>"You court an earlier and more horrible death than we had
planned for you," squeaked Woora.</p>

<p>The ape-man made no reply. He was examining the trap that had
caught him. It was a heavy net of rawhide the mouth of which
could be pulled from the floor and closed by a cord that ran
through a block depending from a ceiling beam and thence through
a hole near the ceiling into the room where Woora had waited to
snare his prey. It was plain to Tarzan that this room was devoted
solely to the purposes of the net, forming the magician's final
protection against an assassin who sought his life.</p>

<p>In this he was only partially right, as previously all of its
victims had been invited to his innermost sanctum by the magician
and, rendered helpless in the net, easily murdered. Tonight it
served a new purpose.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the success of his strategy in luring the
stranger to this room, Woora was in a pleasant frame of mind. The
fear and the anger had left his eyes. He surveyed the ape-man
with interest.</p>

<p>"You intrigue me," he said. "I shall keep you here for a while
to examine you. Perhaps you will get hungry and thirsty, but one
who is shortly to die has no need of food or drink. But you shall
watch me eat and drink, and you shall meditate upon the various
slow and torturing deaths that man may die. I promise you that I
shall select something novel and protracted for you, if only to
avenge the killing of my pet&mdash;the one creature in all the
world that I really loved. You shall die many deaths for that and
not a few for seeking to destroy me or steal the great emerald. I
do not know which you planned doing, nor do I care. Either
warrants the direst punishment of which I can conceive.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, I shall show you that Woora can be kind even
to an enemy. It is well for you that I am neither cruel nor
vindictive. I would save you from unnecessary suffering, from
mental anguish induced by the sight of horrible or suggestive
objects. Watch me closely."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking he stepped into the adjoining room where
he busied himself lighting the charcoal in a brazier. It took
some time to produce a hot fire; but when this was accomplished,
he fetched a long metal rod with a sharpened point and a wooden
handle. The point he inserted among the hot coals; then he turned
his attention once more to the ape-man.</p>

<p>"The human heads upon the walls of my apartment, the
paraphernalia of my profession, the preparations that I must make
for your torture and death; the sight of these things would prove
most depressing to you and add unnecessarily to your suffering;
therefore I am going to burn out your eyes so that you cannot see
them!"</p>

<p>And yet the ape-man did not speak. His level gaze remained
fixed upon the repulsive figure of the old magician and the weird
setting in which he wrought his villainies, all bathed in the
unholy green light of the great emerald. What his thoughts were
only he knew, but it is safe to assume that they were not of
death&mdash;not of his own death. Probably they were of escape.
He tested the strength of the rawhide net. It gave, but it did
not break.</p>

<p>Woora saw him and laughed. "A bull elephant could not break
that," he said. With his grotesque head cocked upon one side he
stared intently at his victim. The laugh died on his lips,
leaving a snarl. He was angry because the ape-man showed no fear.
He looked to the iron, muttering and mumbling to himself. It had
grown hot; the point glowed.</p>

<p>"Take a last look, my guest," cackled Woora, "for after a
moment you will never again see anything." He withdrew the iron
from the coals and approached his prisoner.</p>

<p>The strands of the net closed snugly about the ape-man,
confining his arms; so that though he could move them, he could
move them neither quickly nor far. He would have difficulty in
defending himself against the glowing point of the iron rod.</p>

<p>Woora came close and raised the red-hot iron to the level of
Tarzan's eyes; then he jabbed suddenly at one of them. The victim
warded off the searing point from its intended target. Only his
hand was burned. Again and again Woora jabbed; but always Tarzan
succeeded in saving his eyes, yet at the expense of his hands and
forearms.</p>

<p>At his repeated failures to blind his victim, Woora became
convulsed with rage. He screamed and cursed as he danced about,
foaming at the mouth; then, quite suddenly, he gained control of
himself. He carried the iron back to the brazier and inserted it
among the coals; then he stepped to another part of the room that
was not in line with the doorway, and therefore outside the range
of Tarzan's vision. He was gone for but a moment, and when he
returned he carried a rope in his hand.</p>

<p>He was chuckling again as he approached Tarzan. "The iron will
be hotter this time," he said, "and this time it will reach your
eyes."</p>

<p>He passed the rope around the net and Tarzan and made a slip
noose and drew it tight; then he walked around and around the
ape-man, binding his hands and his arms with many coils of rope
until Tarzan had no use of them for protection.</p>

<p>Now he went to the brazier and withdrew the iron. It glowed
strangely red in the weird green light of the chamber. With it,
Woora crept slowly toward his victim as though he were trying to
prolong the agony of suspense; but Tarzan gave no evidence of
fear. He knew that he was helpless, and he awaited the inevitable
with stoic indifference.</p>

<p>Suddenly Woora was seized by another spasm of fury. "You
pretend that you are not afraid," he screamed, "but I'll make you
shriek for mercy yet. First the right eye!" And he came forward
again, holding the red point on a level with the ape-man's
eyes.</p>

<p>Tarzan heard the door behind him open. He saw Woora shrink
back, a new expression of fury writ upon his face; then a man
leaped past him carrying a stout wooden bar in his hand. It was
Lord.</p>

<p>Woora turned to flee into the next apartment, but Lord
overtook him, striking him a glancing blow on the head with the
rod. The magician turned then and sought to defend himself with
the hot iron. He screamed for mercy and for help; but there was
no mercy in Lord's attack, and no help came.</p>

<p>Wielding the rod in both hands, the Englishman struck the iron
from Woora's hand, breaking the arm at the wrist; then he swung
it again furiously, crashing full on the grotesque skull; and
with a splintering and crushing of bone Woora sank to the floor,
dead.</p>

<p>Lord turned to Tarzan. "A close call," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, a very close call. I shall not forget it."</p>

<p>"I saw you kill the panther," continued Lord. "My word! I'd
never have thought it possible. Then I waited. I didn't know just
what to do. Presently I commenced to worry; I knew what a wily
old devil Woora was; so I followed you, and it was a good thing
that I did."</p>

<p>While he talked, the Englishman found a knife and cut the
bonds and the net that held the ape-man; then the two men
examined the contents of the inner room. There was a small
furnace in one corner, several retorts and test tubes on a long
table, shelves with bottles and vials stored upon them, a small
library of occultism, black magic, voodooism. In a little niche,
before which stood a chair, there was a crystal sphere. But,
dominating all, the center of everything, was the great
emerald.</p>

<p>Lord looked at it, spellbound, fascinated. "It is worth over
two million pounds sterling," he said, "and it is ours for the
taking! There are still several hours of darkness; and it may be
hours more, perhaps days, before anyone discovers that Woora is
dead and the emerald gone. They could never overtake us."</p>

<p>"You forget your friends here," Tarzan reminded him.</p>

<p>"Any one of them would do the same if he had the chance,"
argued Lord. "They will have their freedom. We have given them
that. The emerald should be ours."</p>

<p>"You have also forgotten the Kaji. How will you pass through
their country?"</p>

<p>Lord gestured his disgust. "There is always something; but
you're right&mdash;we can't escape except with a large
force."</p>

<p>"There is a question whether you can escape Mafka even then,"
said Tarzan. "I've seen some evidence of his power. By
comparison, Woora's didn't amount to much."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what?"</p>

<p>"I'll go ahead and try to dispose of Mafka," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Good! I'll go with you."</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head. "I must go alone. Mafka's occult
powers are such that he can control the actions of his victims
even at great distances, but for some reason he has no power over
me. He might have over you. That is the reason I must go alone;
he might sense the presence of another with me and through him
learn my plans&mdash;his powers are most uncanny."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, Tarzan picked up the great emerald, and
wrapped it in a bit of cloth he had torn from a banging on the
wall.</p>

<p>Lord's eyes narrowed. "What are you doing that for?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm taking the emerald with me. It will insure my getting an
audience with Mafka."</p>

<p>Lord gave a short, ugly laugh. "And you think you can get away
with that?" he demanded. "What do you take me for&mdash;a
fool?"</p>

<p>Tarzan knew the greed of men. That was one of the reasons he
liked beasts so well. "If you try to interfere," he said, "I'll
know that you are a fool&mdash;you saw what I did to the panther
and how easily."</p>

<p>"What do you want with two million pounds? Maybe three
million&mdash;God alone knows what it's worth. There's plenty for
both of us."</p>

<p>"I don't want any of it," replied the ape-man. "I have all the
wealth I need. I'm going to use it to get some of my people away
from Mafka. When that is done, I won't care what becomes of
it."</p>

<p>He tied two cords to the package holding the emerald. One he
looped over his head, the other he tied around his waist holding
the package close to his body. He picked up the knife that Lord
had laid on the table and stuck it in his own scabbard; then he
found a long piece of rope which he coiled and slung across a
shoulder.</p>

<p>Lord watched him sullenly. He remembered the panther and knew
that he was helpless to prevent the stranger taking the
emerald.</p>

<p>"I'm going now," said Tarzan. "Wait a day, and then follow
with all those who want to get out. No matter whether I'm
successful or not you may have to fight your way through the
Kaji, but with Mafka out of the way you'll stand a much better
chance. If I get through, I'll cache the emerald on the Neubari
near the mouth of the Mafa and go on about my business. In about
three weeks I shall be back again; then I'll turn the emerald
over to the Zuli."</p>

<p>"To the Zuli!" exclaimed Lord. "Where do I come in? The
emerald belongs to me, and you're trying to cheat me out of it.
Is this what I get for saving your life?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "It is none of my business," he said. "I do
not care who gets the emerald. You told me there was a plan afoot
to take it and with the proceeds finance all the Zuli in their
desire to go and live in civilization. I did not know that you
planned to betray your comrades."</p>

<p>Lord's eyes could not meet those of the ape-man, and he
flushed as he replied. "I'll see that they get theirs," he said,
"but I want to control it. What do they know about business?
They'd be cheated out of everything in a month."</p>

<p>"On the Neubari in three weeks, then," said the ape-man, as he
turned and quit the apartment.</p>

<p>As Tarzan vaulted the sill of the window in the outer room and
started across the compound where lay the dead body of the black
panther, Lord opened the door leading to the throne-room and
hastened at a run to the guard-room, his mind busy with a plan
based on the belief that the stranger intended to make off with
the great emerald and keep it for himself.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII. &mdash; GREEN MAGIC</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE guards in the corridor outside the throne-
room were so surprised to see anyone coming from the throneroom
at that time in the night that Lord was past them before they
recovered their wits. They pursued him, shouting commands to
halt, to the doorway of the guard-room where, by this time, all
the women warriors were aroused and leaping to arms.</p>

<p>Lorro was the first to recognize the Englishman. "What is it,
Lord?" she demanded. "What are you doing here? How did you get
out of the cell? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"The great emerald!" cried Lord. "The Kaji has killed Woora
and stolen the great emerald."</p>

<p>"Killed Woora!" exclaimed half a dozen of the women in unison.
"You mean that Woora is dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Lord impatiently. "But the emerald's
stolen. Can't you understand that?"</p>

<p>"Woora is dead!" screamed the women; as with one accord they
rushed for the village street to spread the happy tidings.</p>

<p>Out in the night, a short distance beyond the village, Tarzan
heard the commotion, followed by the hoarse notes of a primitive
trumpet. He recognized the call to arms to which now was added
the throbbing of the war drums, and guessed that Lord had spread
the alarm and was organizing a pursuit.</p>

<p>The ape-man increased his speed, moving unerringly along the
trail that he had passed over but once before, and that at night;
and behind him came the entire tribe of Zuli warrior women with
their white men and their black slaves.</p>

<p>Lord had at last succeeded in impressing on the minds of the
Zuli that the death of Woora was an empty beneficence without
possession of the emerald that was to have given them wealth and
independence in the outer world; so that it was an angry, blood-
thirsty mob that pursued the Lord of the Jungle through the soft
African night.</p>

<p>Plain to the ears of the ape-man came the sounds of the
pursuit, and he guessed the temper of the pursuers. If they
overtook him, he could hope for neither victory nor quarter.
There were too many of them for the one, and they were too angry
and too savage to accord the other. Only the cunning of the wild
beast that environment and training had implanted within him
could avail him against such odds.</p>

<p>As he trotted along the winding trail that led up the course
of the rivulet toward the divide he became acutely aware of a
presence that he could not see. His acute senses told him that he
was alone, yet the feeling persisted that he was not alone.
Something moved with him, clinging as closely as his shadow. He
stopped to listen. The thing seemed so near that he should have
heard it breathe, but there was no sound. His keen nostrils
sought a clue&mdash;there was none.</p>

<p>As he trotted on he sought to reason out the mystery. He even
tried to convince himself that he was the victim of a delusion;
but Tarzan had never had a delusion&mdash;he had only heard that
others sometimes had them. And always the presence was with him,
haunting him like a ghost.</p>

<p>He smiled. Perhaps that was it&mdash;the ghost of Woora. And
then, quite suddenly the truth dawned upon him. It was the great
emerald!</p>

<p>It seemed impossible, yet it could be nothing else. The
mysterious stone had some quality in common with life&mdash;an
aura that was, perhaps, mesmeric. It was conceivable that it was
this very thing that had imparted to Woora the occult powers that
had made him so feared, so powerful. This would account in part
for the care with which the stone had been guarded.</p>

<p>If this were true, then the same conditions might obtain with
the Gonfal, the great diamond of the Kaji. Without it, the power
of Mafka would be gone. The ape-man wondered. He also wondered if
Mafka's power would be doubled if he possessed both the diamond
and the emerald.</p>

<p>How would these stones affect the power of others? Did the
mere possession of one of them impart to any mortal such powers
as those wielded by Woora and Mafka? The idea intrigued Tarzan.
He let his mind play with it for a while as he trotted up toward
the divide; then he reached a decision.</p>

<p>Turning abruptly to the right, he left the trail and sought a
place of concealment. Presently he found a great boulder at the
foot of the canyon wall. Behind it he would be hidden from the
view of anyone passing along the trail. Always cautious, he
looked about for an avenue of retreat, if one became necessary,
and saw that he could scale the canyon side easily; then he
placed himself behind the boulder and waited.</p>

<p>He heard the Zuli coming up the trail. They were making no
effort to conceal their presence. It was evident that they were
quite sure that the fugitive could not escape them.</p>

<p>Now the head of the column came into view. It was led by Lord.
There were over fifty men, mostly white, and three or four
hundred warrior-women. Tarzan concentrated his efforts on the
latter.</p>

<p>"Turn back! Turn back!" he willed. "Go back to the village and
stay there."</p>

<p>The women kept on along the trail, apparently unaffected; yet
Tarzan felt the presence of the emerald more strongly than ever.
He raised it from his side and tore away the skin in which he had
wrapped it. Its polished surface, reflecting the moonlight, gave
forth rays that enveloped the ape-man in an unearthly glow.</p>

<p>As his bare hands touched the stone he felt a tingling in his
arms, his body, as though a mild electric current were passing
through him. He felt a surge of new power&mdash;a strange,
uncanny power that had never before been his. Again he willed the
women to turn back, and now he knew that they would turn, now he
knew his own power without question, without a doubt.</p>

<p>The women stopped and turned about.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded one of the men.</p>

<p>"I am going back," replied a woman.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I only know that I have to go back. I do not
believe that Woora is dead. He is calling me back. He is calling
us all back."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Lord. "Woora is dead. I saw him killed.
His skull was crushed to a pulp."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless he is calling us back."</p>

<p>The women were already starting back along the trail. The men
stood undecided.</p>

<p>Presently Lord said in a low tone, "Let them go," and they all
stood watching until after the women had disappeared beyond a
turn in the trail.</p>

<p>"There are over fifty of us," said Lord then, "and we do not
need the women. There will be fewer to divide with when we get
out with the emerald."</p>

<p>"We haven't got it yet," another reminded him.</p>

<p>"It is as good as ours if we overtake the Kaji before he gets
back to his own village. He's a tough customer, but fifty of us
can kill him."</p>

<p>Tarzan, behind the boulder, heard and smiled&mdash;just the
shadow of a smile; a grim shadow.</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Lord. "Let's be going," but he did not move.
No one moved.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you start?" demanded one of the others.</p>

<p>Lord paled. He looked frightened. "Why don't you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I can't," said the man, "and neither can you. You know it.
It's the power of Woora. The woman was right&mdash;he is not
dead. God! How we'll be punished!"</p>

<p>"I tell you he is dead," growled Lord, "dead as a
doornail."</p>

<p>"Then it's his ghost," suggested a man. His voice
trembled.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried one and pointed.</p>

<p>With one accord they all looked in the direction their
companion indicated. One who had been a Catholic crossed himself.
Another prayed beneath his breath. Lord cursed.</p>

<p>From behind a large boulder set well back from the trail
spread a greenish luminosity, faint, shimmering, sending out
tenuous rays of emerald light, challenging the soft brilliance of
the moon.</p>

<p>The men stood spellbound, their eyes fixed upon the miracle.
Then a man stepped from behind the boulder&mdash;a bronzed giant
clothed only in a loin-cloth.</p>

<p>"The Kaji!" exclaimed Lord.</p>

<p>"And the great emerald," said another. "Now is our chance."
But no one drew a weapon; no one advanced upon the stranger. They
could only wish; their wills could not command disobedience to
him who possessed the mysterious power of the emerald.</p>

<p>Tarzan came down to them. He stopped and looked them over
appraisingly. "There are over fifty of you," he said. "You will
come with me to the village of the Kaji. Some of my people are
prisoners there. We will free them; then we will all go out of
the Kaji country and go our ways."</p>

<p>He did not ask them; he told them; for he and they both knew
that while he possessed the great emerald he did not have to
ask.</p>

<p>"But the emerald," said Lord; "you promised to divide that
with me."</p>

<p>"When, a few minutes ago, you planned to kill me," replied the
ape-man, "you forfeited your right to hold me to that promise.
Also, since then, I have discovered the power of the emerald. The
stone is dangerous. In the hands of a man such as you, it could
do untold harm. When I am through with it, it will go into the
Neubari where no man shall ever find it."</p>

<p>Lord gasped. "God, man!" he cried. "You wouldn't do that! You
couldn't throw away a fortune of two or three million pounds! No,
you're just saying that. You don't want to divide it&mdash;that's
it. You want to keep it all for yourself."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "Think what you please," he said; "it makes
no difference. Now you will follow me," and thus they started
once more along the trail that led across the divide and down
into the country of the Kaji.</p>

<p><br>
IT was dusk of the following day when, from a slight eminence,
Tarzan saw for the first time the city of Kaji and the stronghold
of Mafka. It was built at the side of a valley close to the face
of a perpendicular limestone cliff. It appeared to be a place
considerably larger than the Zuli village from which he had just
escaped. He stood gazing at it for a few moments; then he turned
to the men grouped behind him.</p>

<p>"We have travelled far and eaten little," he said. "Many of
you are tired. It will not be well to approach the city until
well after dark; therefore we will rest." He took a spear from
one of the men and drew a long line upon the ground with the
sharp point. "You cannot cross this line," he said, "not one of
you." Then he handed the spear back to its owner, walked a short
distance away from the line that he had drawn between them, and
lay down. One hand rested upon the gleaming surface of the
emerald; thus he slept.</p>

<p>The others, glad of an opportunity to rest, lay down
immediately; and soon all were asleep. No, not all. Lord remained
awake, his fascinated eyes held by the faint radiance of the
jewel that conjured in his mind the fleshpots of civilization its
wealth might purchase.</p>

<p>Dusk passed quickly, and night came. The moon had not yet
risen, and it was very dark. Only the green luminosity
surrounding the ape-man relieved the Stygian blackness. In its
weird radiance Lord could see the man he called the Kaji. He
watched the hand resting upon the emerald&mdash;watched and
waited; for Lord knew much of the power of the great stone and
the manner in which it was conferred upon its possessor.</p>

<p>He made plans; some he discarded. He waited. Tarzan moved in
his sleep; his hand slipped from the face of the emerald; then
Lord arose. He gripped his spear firmly and crept cautiously
toward the sleeping man. Tarzan had not slept for two days, and
he was sunk in the slumber of exhaustion.</p>

<p>At the line Tarzan had drawn upon the ground Lord hesitated a
moment; then he stepped across and knew that the power of the
emerald had passed from the stranger as his hand had slipped from
the stone. For many years Lord had watched Woora, and he knew
that always when he would force his will upon another some part
of his body was in contact with the emerald; but he breathed a
sigh of relief with the confirmation of his hope.</p>

<p>Now he approached the sleeping ape-man, his spear ready in his
hand. He came close and stood silently for an instant above the
unconscious sleeper; then he stooped and gathered up the
emerald.</p>

<p>The plan to kill Tarzan was one of those he had discarded. He
feared the man might make an outcry before he died and arouse the
others; and this did not fit in with Lord's plan, which was to
possess the emerald for himself alone.</p>

<p>Creeping stealthily away, Lord disappeared in the night.</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; THE LEOPARD
PIT</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE ape-man awoke with a start. The moon was
shining full upon his face. Instantly he knew that he had slept
too long. He sensed that something was amiss. He felt for the
emerald; and when he did not feel it, he looked for it. It was
gone. He leaped to his feet and approached the sleeping men. A
quick glance confirmed his first suspicion&mdash;Lord was
gone!</p>

<p>He considered the men. There were fifty of them. Without the
emerald he had no power over them; he could not control them.
They would be enemies. He turned away and circled the camp until
he picked up the scent-spoor of the thief. It was where he had
expected to find it&mdash;leading down the valley of the Mafa
toward the valley of the Neubari.</p>

<p>He did not know how much start Lord had. It might be as much
as two hours; but had it been two weeks, it would have been the
same. No man could escape the Lord of the Jungle.</p>

<p>Through the night he followed, the scent-spoor strong in his
nostrils. The trail gave the city of the Kaji a wide berth. The
terrain was open and sloped gently, the moon was bright. Tarzan
moved swiftly, far more swiftly than Lord.</p>

<p>He had been following the Englishman for perhaps an hour when
he discerned far ahead a faint, greenish light. It was moving a
little to the right of a direct line; and Tarzan knew that,
having passed the city of the Kaji, Lord was swinging back onto
the direct trail. By cutting straight across, the ape-man would
gain considerable distance. As he did so, he increased his speed,
moving swiftly, with long, easy strides.</p>

<p>He was gaining rapidly when suddenly the ground gave way
beneath his feet and he was precipitated into a black hole. He
fell on loose earth and slender branches that formed a cushion,
breaking the fall; so that he was not injured.</p>

<p>When he regained his feet he found that it was difficult to
move about among the branches that gave when he stepped on them
or entangled his feet if he endeavored to avoid them. Looking up,
he saw the mouth of the pit out of reach above him. He guessed
its purpose. It was probably a leopard pit, used by the Kaji to
capture the fierce cats alive. And he realized, too, the purpose
of the loose earth and branches that had broken his fall; they
gave no firm footing from which a leopard could spring to
freedom. He looked up again at the pit's rim. It was far above
his head. He doubted that a cat could have leaped out of it if
there had been no branches on the floor; he was sure that he
could not.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but wait. If this were a new pit, and
it looked new, the Kaji would be along within a day or so; then
he would be killed or captured. This was about all he had to
expect. No leopard would fall in upon him now that the mouth of
the pit was no longer concealed by the covering he had broken
through.</p>

<p>He thought of Lord and of the harm he could do were he to
reach the outside world in possession of the great emerald of the
Zuli, but he did not concern himself greatly on account of his
failure to overtake the Englishman. What was, was. He had done
his best. He never repined; he never worried. He merely awaited
the next event in life, composed in the knowledge that whatever
it was he would meet it with natural resources beyond those of
ordinary men. He was not egotistical; he was merely quite sure of
himself.</p>

<p>The night wore on, and he took advantage of it to add to his
sleep. His nerves, uncontaminated by dissipation, were not even
slightly unstrung by his predicament or by the imminence of
capture or death. He slept.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when he awoke. He listened
intently for the sound that had awakened him. It was the sound of
footfalls carried to him from a distance through the medium of
the earth. They came closer. He heard voices. So, they were
coming! They would be surprised when they saw the leopard they
had trapped.</p>

<p>They came closer, and he heard them exclaim with satisfaction
when they discovered that the covering of the pit had been broken
through; then they were at the pit's edge looking down at him. He
saw the faces of several warrior women and some men. They were
filled with astonishment.</p>

<p>"A fine leopard!" exclaimed one.</p>

<p>"Mafka will be glad to have another recruit."</p>

<p>"But how did he get here? How could he pass the guards at the
entrance to the valley?"</p>

<p>"Let's get him up here. Hey, you! Catch this rope and tie it
around under your arms." A rope was tossed down to him.</p>

<p>"Hold it," said the ape-man, "and I'll climb out." He had long
since decided to go into captivity without a struggle for two
reasons. One was that resistance would doubtless mean certain
death; the other, that captivity would bring him closer to Mafka,
possibly simplify the rescue of Wood and his friends. It did not
occur to Tarzan to take into consideration the fact that he might
not be able to affect his own escape. He was not wont to consider
any proposition from a premise of failure. Perhaps this in itself
accounted to some extent for the fact that he seldom failed in
what he attempted.</p>

<p>Those above held the rope while the ape-man swarmed up it with
the agility of a monkey. When he stood upon solid ground, he was
faced with several spear-points. There were eight women and four
men. All were white. The women were armed; the men carried a
heavy net.</p>

<p>The women appraised him boldly. "Who are you?" demanded one of
them.</p>

<p>"A hunter," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I was on my way down in search of the Neubari when I fell
into your pit."</p>

<p>"You were going out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But how did you get in? There is only one entrance to the
country of the Kaji, and that is guarded. How did you get past
our warriors?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "Evidently I did not come in that way," he
said.</p>

<p>"There is no other way, I tell you," insisted the warrior.</p>

<p>"But I came in another way. I entered the mountains several
marches from here to hunt; that is the reason I came down from
the east. I hunted in the back country, coming down from the
north. The going was rough. I was looking for an easier way to
the Neubari. Now that I am out of the pit, I'll go on my
way."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," said the woman who had first addressed him and
who had done most of the talking since. "You are coming with us.
You are a prisoner."</p>

<p>"All right," conceded the ape-man. "Have it your own
way&mdash;you are eight spears, and I am only one knife."</p>

<p>Presently, Tarzan was not even a knife; for they took it away
from him. They did not bind his hands behind him, evidencing
their contempt for the prowess of men. Some of them marched
ahead, some behind Tarzan and the four other men, as they started
back toward the city that could be seen in the near distance. At
any time the ape-man could have made a break for escape had he
wished to, and with the chances greatly in his favor because of
his great speed; but it pleased him to go to the city of the
Kaji.</p>

<p>His captors talked incessantly among themselves. They
discussed other women who were not with them, always
disparagingly; they complained of the difficulties they
experienced in the dressing of their hair; they compared the cut
and fit and quality of the pelts that formed their loincloths;
and each of them expatiated upon the merits of some exceptionally
rare skin she hoped to acquire in the future.</p>

<p>The four men marching with Tarzan sought to engage him in
conversation. One was a Swede, one a Pole, one a German, and one
an Englishman. All spoke the strange tongue of the Kaji&mdash;a
mixture of many tongues. Tarzan could understand them, but he had
difficulty in making them understand him unless he spoke in the
native tongue of the one he chanced to be talking to or spoke in
French, which he had learned from d'Arnot before he acquired a
knowledge of English. The Swede alone understood no French, but
he spoke broken English, a language the German understood but not
the Pole. Thus a general conversation was rendered difficult. He
found it easier to talk to the Englishman, whose French was
sketchy, in their common language.</p>

<p>He heard this man addressed as Troll, and recalled that
Stanley Wood had told him that this was the name of one of their
white hunters. The man was short and stalky, with heavy, stooped
shoulders and long arms that gave him a gorillaesque appearance.
He was powerfully muscled. Tarzan moved closer to him.</p>

<p>"You were with Wood and van Eyk?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man looked up at Tarzan in surprise. "You know them?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I know Wood. They recaptured him?"</p>

<p>Troll nodded. "You can't get away from this damned place.
Mafka always drags you back, if he doesn't kill you. Wood nearly
got away. A fellow&mdash;" He paused. "Say, are you
Clayton?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Wood told me about you. I ought to have known you right away
from his description of you."</p>

<p>"Is he still alive?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mafka hasn't killed him yet, but he's mighty sore. No
one ever came so near escaping before. I guess it made the old
duffer shake in his pants&mdash;only he don't wear pants. A big
expedition of whites could make it hot for him&mdash;say a
battalion of Tommies. God-almighty! How I'd like to see 'em come
marchin' in."</p>

<p>"How about the Gonfal?" inquired Tarzan. "Couldn't he stop
them, just as he does others, with the power of the great
diamond?"</p>

<p>"No one knows, but we think not. Because if he could, why is
he so scared of one of us escaping?"</p>

<p>"Do you think Mafka intends to kill Wood?"</p>

<p>"We're pretty sure of it. He's not only sore about his almost
getting away, but he's sorer still because Wood has a crush on
Gonfala, the Queen; and it looks like Gonfala was sort of soft on
Wood. That'd be too bad, too; because she's a Negress."</p>

<p>"Wood told me she was white."</p>

<p>"She's whiter than you, but look at these dames here. Ain't
they white? They look white, but they all got Negro blood in 'em.
But don't never remind 'em of it. You remember Kipling's, 'She
knifed me one night 'cause I wished she was white'? Well that's
it; that's the answer. They want to be white. God only knows why;
nobody ever sees 'em but us; and we don't care what color they
are. They could be green as far as I'm concerned. I'm married to
six of 'em. They make me do all the work while they sit around
an' gabble about hair and loincloths. God almighty! I hate the
sight of hair an' loincloths. When they ain't doin' that they're
knockin' hell out o' some dame that ain't there.</p>

<p>"I got an old woman back in England. I thought she was bad. I
run away from her, an' look what I go into! Six of em."</p>

<p>Troll kept up a running fire of conversation all the way to
the city. He had more troubles than the exchange desk in a
department store.</p>

<p>The city of Kaji was walled with blocks of limestone quarried
from the cliff against which it was built. The buildings within
the enclosure were of limestone also. They were of one and two
stories, except the palace of Mafka, which rose against the cliff
to a height of four stories.</p>

<p>The palace and the city gave evidence of having been long in
the building, some parts of the palace and some of the buildings
below it being far more weather-worn than others. There were
black men and white and warrior women in the streets. A few
children, all girls, played in the sunshine; milch goats were
everywhere under foot. These things and many others the ape-man
observed as he was conducted along the main street toward the
palace of Mafka.</p>

<p>He heard the women discussing him and appraising him as
farmers might discuss a prize bull. One of them remarked that he
should bring a good price. But he moved on, apparently totally
oblivious of them all.</p>

<p>The interior of the palace reminded him of that of Woora,
except that there was more and richer stuff here. Mafka was
nearer the source of supply. Here was the loot of many safaris.
Tarzan wondered how Woora had obtained anything.</p>

<p>The four men had been dismissed within the city; only the
eight women accompanied Tarzan into the palace. They had been
halted at the heavily guarded entrance and had waited there while
word was carried into the interior; then with a number of the
guard as escort, they had been led into the palace.</p>

<p>Down a long corridor to another guarded doorway they
proceeded; then they were ushered into a large chamber. At the
far end, a figure crouched upon a throne. At sight of him, Tarzan
was almost surprised into a show of emotion&mdash;it was
Woora!</p>

<p>Beside him, on another throne-chair, sat a beautiful girl.
Tarzan assumed that this must be Gonfala, the Queen. But Woora!
He had seen the man killed before his own eyes. Did magic go as
far as this, that it could resurrect the dead?</p>

<p>As he was led forward and halted before the thrones he waited
for Woora to recognize him, to show the resentment he must feel
because he had been thwarted and the great emerald stolen from
him; but the man gave no indication that he ever had seen Tarzan
before.</p>

<p>He listened to the report of the leader of the party that had
captured the ape-man, but all the time his eyes were upon the
prisoner. They seemed to be boring through him, yet there was no
sign of recognition. When the report had been completed, the
magician shook his head impatiently. He appeared baffled and
troubled.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am an Englishman. I was hunting."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"Food."</p>

<p>While the magician questioned Tarzan he kept a hand upon an
immense diamond that rested on a stand beside him. It was the
Gonfal, the great diamond of the Kaji, that endowed its possessor
with the same mysterious powers that were inherent in the great
emerald of the Zuli.</p>

<p>The girl upon the second throne-chair sat silent and sullen,
her eyes always on the ape-man. She wore breastplates of virgin
gold and a stomacher covered with gold sequins. Her skirt was of
the skins of unborn leopards, soft and clinging. Dainty sandals
shod her, and upon her upper arms and her wrists and her ankles
were many bands of copper and gold. A light crown rested upon her
blond head. She was the symbol of power; but Tarzan knew that the
real power lay in the grotesque and hideous figure at her side,
clothed only in an old and dirty loincloth.</p>

<p>Finally the man motioned impatiently. "Take him away," he
commanded.</p>

<p>"Am I not to choose wives for him?" demanded Gonfala. "The
women would pay well for this one."</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied her companion. "There are reasons why I
should observe him for a while. It will probably be better to
destroy him than give him to the women. Take him away!"</p>

<p>The guard took the ape-man to an upper floor and put him in a
large chamber. There they left him alone, bolting the door behind
them as they departed. The apartment was absolutely bare except
for two benches. Several small windows in the wall overlooking
the city gave light and ventilation. In the opposite wall was an
enormous fireplace in which, apparently, no fire had ever been
built.</p>

<p>Tarzan investigated his prison. He found the windows too high
above the ground to offer an avenue of escape without the aid of
a rope, and he had no rope. The fireplace was the only other
feature of the apartment that might arouse any interest
whatsoever. It was unusually large, so deep that it resembled a
cave; and when he stepped into it he did not have to stoop. He
wondered why such an enormous fireplace should be built and then
never used.</p>

<p>Entering it, he looked up the flue, thinking that here he
might find a way out if the flue were built in size proportionate
to the fire chamber. However, he was doomed to disappointment;
not the faintest glimmer of light shone down to indicate an
opening that led to the outside.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that the fireplace had been built merely
as an architectural adornment to the chamber&mdash;that it was
false? This seemed highly improbable, since the room had no other
embellishment; nor was the fireplace itself of any architectural
beauty, being nothing more than an opening in the wall.</p>

<p>What then could its purpose have been? The question intrigued
the active imagination of the Lord of the Jungle. It was, of
course, possible that there was a flue but that it had been
closed; and this would have been the obvious explanation had the
fireplace shown any indication of ever having been used. However,
it did not; there was not the slightest discoloration of the
interior&mdash;no fire had ever burned within it.</p>

<p>Tarzan reached upward as far as he could but felt no ceiling;
then he ran his fingers up the rear wall of the fire chamber.
Just at his finger tips he felt a ledge. Raising himself on his
toes, he gripped the ledge firmly with the fingers of both hands;
then he raised himself slowly upward. Even when his arms were
straight and he had raised himself as far as he could his head
touched no ceiling. He inclined his body slowly forward until at
length he lay prone upon the ledge. The recess, then, was at
least several feet deep.</p>

<p>He drew his legs up and then rose slowly to his feet. He
raised a hand above his head, and a foot above he felt the stone
of a ceiling&mdash;there was plenty of headroom. Laterally, the
opening was about three feet wide.</p>

<p>He reached ahead to discover its depth, but his hand touched
nothing; then he moved forward slowly a few steps&mdash;still
nothing. Moving cautiously, he groped his way forward. Soon he
was convinced of what he had suspected&mdash;he was in a
corridor, and the secret of the "fireplace" was partially
revealed. But where did the corridor lead?</p>

<p>It was very dark. He might be on the verge of a pitfall
without suspecting it. If there were branching corridors he might
become hopelessly lost in a minute or two; so he kept his left
hand constantly in contact with the wall on that side; he moved
slowly, feeling forward with each foot before he threw his weight
upon it, and his right hand was always extended before him.</p>

<p>Thus he moved along for a considerable distance, the corridor
turning gradually to the left until he was moving at right angles
to his original course. Presently he saw a faint light ahead,
coming apparently from the floor of the corridor. When he
approached it more closely, he saw that it came from an opening
in the floor. He stopped at the brink of the opening and looked
down. Some seven feet below he saw stone flagging&mdash;it was
the floor of a fireplace. Evidently this secret passage led from
one false fireplace to another.</p>

<p>He listened intently but could hear nothing other than what
might have been very soft breathing&mdash;almost too faint a
sound to register even upon the keen ears of the ape-man; but his
nostrils caught the faint aroma of a woman.</p>

<p>For a moment Tarzan hesitated; then he dropped softly to the
floor of the fireplace. He made no sound. Before him lay a
chamber of barbarous luxury. At a window in the opposite wall,
looking down upon the city, stood a golden-haired girl, her back
toward the fireplace.</p>

<p>Tarzan did not have to see her face to know that it was
Gonfala.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9">IX. &mdash; THE END OF THE
CORRIDOR</a></h2>

<p class="first">NOISELESSLY he stepped into the chamber and
moved toward the end of the room, nearer to the doorway. He
sought to reach the door before she discovered him. He would
rather that she did not know how he gained entrance to the room.
A heavy wooden bolt fastened the door from the inside. He reached
the door without attracting the girl's attention and laid a hand
upon the bolt.</p>

<p>He slipped it back quietly; then he moved away from the door
toward the window where the girl still stood absorbed in her
daydream. He could see her profile. She no longer looked sullen
but, rather, ineffably sad.</p>

<p>The man was quite close to her before she became aware of his
presence. She had not heard him. She was just conscious,
suddenly, that she was not alone; and she turned slowly from the
window. Only a slight widening of the eyes and a little intake of
her breath revealed her surprise. She did not scream; she did not
exclaim.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," he said; "I'm not here to harm you."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," she replied; "I have many warriors within
call. But how did you get here?" She glanced at the door and saw
that the bolt was not shot. "I must have forgotten to bolt the
door, but I can't understand how you got by the guard. It is
still there, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Tarzan did not answer. He stood looking at her, marvelling at
the subtle change that had taken place in her since he had seen
her in the throne room just a short time before. She was no
longer the queen, but a girl, soft and sweet, appealing.</p>

<p>"Where is Stanley Wood?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What do you know of Stanley Wood?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I am his friend. Where is he? What are they going to do with
him?"</p>

<p>"You are his friend?" she asked, wonderingly, her eyes wide.
"But no, it can make no difference&mdash;no matter how many
friends he has, nothing can save him."</p>

<p>"You would like to see him saved?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you help me? You have the power."</p>

<p>"No, I can't. You don't understand. I am queen. It is I who
must sentence him to death."</p>

<p>"You helped him escape once," Tarzan reminded her.</p>

<p>"Hush! Not so loud," she cautioned. "Mafka suspects that
already. If he knew, I don't know what he would do to him and to
me. But I know he suspects. That is the reason I am kept in this
room with a heavy guard. He says it is for my protection, but I
know better."</p>

<p>"Where is this Mafka? I'd like to see him."</p>

<p>"You have seen him. You were just brought before him in the
throne room."</p>

<p>"That was Woora," objected Tarzan.</p>

<p>She shook her bead. "No. What put that idea in your head?
Woora is with the Zuli."</p>

<p>"So that was Mafka!" said the ape-man, and then he recalled
Lord's theory that Mafka and Woora were identical twins. "But I
thought no one was allowed to see Mafka."</p>

<p>"Stanley Wood told you that," she said. "That is what he
thought; that is what he was told. Mafka was very ill for a long
time. He dared not let it be known. He was afraid some one would
take advantage of it to kill him. But he wanted to see you. He
wished to see a man who could get into our country and so close
to the city as you did without his knowing it. I do not
understand it myself, and I could see that he was disturbed when
he talked with you. Who are you? What are you? How did you get
into my apartment? Have you such powers as Mafka has?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he said. It would do no harm if she thought he
possessed such powers. He spoke in a low tone now and watched her
closely. "You'd like to see Stanley Wood escape; you'd like to go
with him. Why don't you help me?"</p>

<p>She looked at him eagerly. He could read the longing in her
eyes. "How can I help you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Help me to see Mafka&mdash;alone. Tell me where I can find
him."</p>

<p>She trembled, and the fear that was in her was reflected in
her expression.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I can tell you. If you&mdash;" She paused.
Her expression changed; her body stiffened. Her eyes became hard
and cold&mdash;cruel. Her mouth sagged into the sullen
expression it had worn when he had first seen her in the throne
room. He recalled Wood's statement that she was sometimes an
angel, sometimes a she-devil. The metamorphosis had occurred
before his eyes. But what caused it? It was possible, of course,
that she suffered from some form of insanity; yet he doubted it.
He believed there was some other explanation.</p>

<p>"Well?" he queried. "You were saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The guard! The guard!" she cried. "Help!"</p>

<p>Tarzan sprang to the door and shot the bolt. Gonfala whipped a
dagger from her girdle and leaped toward him. Before she could
strike, the ape-man seized her wrist and wrenched the weapon from
her.</p>

<p>The guard were pounding upon the door and shouting for
admittance. The ape-man seized Gonfala by the arm; he held her
dagger ready to strike. "Tell them you are all right," he
whispered. "Tell them to go away."</p>

<p>She snarled and tried to bite his hand. Then she screamed
louder than ever for help.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the room from the door where the guard
sought entrance was a second door, bolted upon the inside like
the other. Toward this the ape-man dragged the screaming Gonfala.
Slipping the bolt, he pushed the door open. Beyond it was another
chamber upon the opposite side of which he saw a third door. Here
was a series of chambers that it might be well to remember.</p>

<p>He pushed Gonfala into the first chamber and closed and bolted
the door. The warriors of the guard were battering now in
earnest. It was evident that they would soon have the door down
and gain entrance to the apartment.</p>

<p>Tarzan crossed to the fireplace and leaped to the mouth of the
secret passage just as the door crashed in and the warriors of
the guard entered the room. He waited where he
was&mdash;listening. He could hear Gonfala screaming in the
adjoining room and pounding on the door, which was now quickly
opened.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she demanded. "Have you got him?"</p>

<p>"Who? There is no one here," replied a member of the
guard.</p>

<p>"The man&mdash;the prisoner that was brought today."</p>

<p>"There was no one here," insisted a warrior.</p>

<p>"Go at once and notify Mafka that he has escaped," she
commanded. "Some of you go to the room in which he was imprisoned
and find out how he got out. Hurry! Don't stand there like
idiots. Don't you suppose I know what I saw? I tell you he was
here. He took my dagger from me and shoved me into that room. Now
go! But some of you stay here. He may come back."</p>

<p>Tarzan waited to hear no more, but retraced his steps through
the passage to the room in which he had been imprisoned. He left
Gonfala's dagger on the high ledge inside the fireplace, and had
barely seated himself on one of the benches in the room when he
heard footsteps in the corridor outside; then the door was swung
open and half a dozen warrior women pushed their way in.</p>

<p>They showed their surprise when they saw him sitting quietly
in his cell.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" demanded one.</p>

<p>"Where could I go?" countered the ape-man.</p>

<p>"You were in the apartment of Gonfala, the Queen."</p>

<p>"But how could I have been?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That is what we want to know."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "Some one is crazy," he said, "but it is not
I. If you think I was there why don't you go ask the queen."</p>

<p>The warriors shook their heads. "What is the use?" demanded
one. "He is here; that is all we have to know. Let Mafka solve
the riddle." Then they left the room.</p>

<p>An hour passed during which Tarzan heard nothing; then the
door was opened and a warrior woman ordered him to come out.
Escorted by a dozen warriors, he was taken through a long
corridor to an apartment on the same floor of the palace. His
sense of direction told him that the room was one of the suite
which adjoined the Queen's.</p>

<p>Mafka was there. He stood behind a table on which rested
something covered with a cloth. Also on the table was the great
diamond of Kaji, the Gonfal. Mafka's left hand rested upon
it.</p>

<p>The ape-man's keen nostrils scented blood, and his eyes saw
that the cloth that covered the object on the table was stained
with blood. Whose blood? Something told him that whatever was
beneath the blood-stained cloth he had been brought to see.</p>

<p>He stood before the magician, his arms folded across his deep
chest, his level, unwavering gaze fixed upon the grotesque figure
facing him. For minutes the two stood there in silence, waging a
strange battle of minds. Mafka was attempting to plumb that of
his prisoner; and Tarzan knew it, but his defense was passive. He
was sure that the other could not control him.</p>

<p>Mafka was annoyed. To be frustrated was a new experience. The
mind of the man before him was a sealed book. He felt a little
bit afraid of him, but curiosity compelled him to see him. It
kept him from ordering his destruction. He wished to fathom him;
he wished to break the seal. Inside that book was something
strange and new. Mafka was determined to learn what it was.</p>

<p>"How did you get to the apartment of the queen?" he demanded
suddenly.</p>

<p>"If I were in the apartment of the queen, who should know it
better than Mafka?" demanded Tarzan. "If I were there, who should
know better than Mafka how I got there?"</p>

<p>The magician appeared discomfited. He shook his head angrily.
"How did you get there?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"How do you know I was there?" countered the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Gonfala saw you."</p>

<p>"Was she sure that it was I in person, or only a figment of
her imagination? Would it not have been possible for the great
Mafka to make her think that I was there when I was not?"</p>

<p>"But I didn't," growled the magician.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some one else did," suggested Tarzan. He was positive
now that Mafka was ignorant of the existence of the secret
passage through which he had gained entrance to the apartment of
Gonfala. Possibly this part of the palace belonged to a period
that antedated Mafka, but why had no one investigated the
fireplaces that were obviously not intended to hold fires? There
was one in this very room where Mafka was and doubtless had been
many times before. Tarzan wondered if it, too, opened into a
corridor and where the corridor led; but he had little time for
conjecture, as Mafka shot another question at him.</p>

<p>"Who has that power but Mafka?" demanded the magician
superciliously, but there was a suggestion of incertitude in his
manner. It was more a challenge to uncertainty than a declaration
of fact.</p>

<p>Tarzan did not reply; and Mafka seemed to have forgotten that
he had put a question, as he continued to study the ape-man
intently. The latter, indifferent, swept the interior of the room
with a leisurely glance that missed nothing. Through open doors
leading to other apartments he saw a bedchamber and a workshop.
The latter was similar to that which he had seen in the palace of
Woora. It was obvious that this was the private suite of
Mafka.</p>

<p>Suddenly the magician shot another question. "How did you get
to Zuli without my sentries seeing you?"</p>

<p>"Who said I had been in Zuli?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You killed my brother. You stole the great emerald of the
Zuli. You were coming here to kill me. You ask who said you had
been in Zuli. The same man who told me these other things. This
man!" And he snatched the cloth from the thing upon the
table.</p>

<p>Glaring at the ape-man with staring eyes was the bloody head
of the Englishman, Lord; and beside it was the great emerald of
the Zuli.</p>

<p>Mafka watched his prisoner intently to note the reaction to
this startling and dramatic climax to the interview, but he
reaped scant satisfaction. The expression on Tarzan's face
underwent no change.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence; then Mafka spoke. "Thus die
the enemies of Mafka," he said. "Thus will you die and the others
who have brought intrigue and discontent to Kaji." He turned to
the captain of the guard. "Take him away. Place him again in the
south chamber with the other troublemakers who are to die with
him. It was an evil day that brought them to Kaji."</p>

<p>Heavily guarded, Tarzan was returned to the room in which he
had been confined. From Mafka's instructions to the captain of
the guard, he had expected to find other prisoners here on his
return; but he was alone. He wondered idly who his future
companions were to be, and then he crossed to one of the windows
and looked out across the city and the broad valley of the
Kaji.</p>

<p>He stood there for a long time trying to formulate some plan
by which he might contact Wood and discuss means by which the
escape of the American could be assured. He had a plan of his
own, but he needed the greater knowledge that Wood possessed of
certain matters connected with Mafka and the Kaji before he could
feel reasonably certain of its Success.</p>

<p>As he stood there pondering the advisability of returning to
Gonfala's apartment and seeking again the cooperation that he
knew she had been on the point of according him when the sudden
Jekyll and Hyde transformation had wrought the amazing change in
her, he heard footsteps outside the door of his prison; then the
bolt was drawn and the door swung open, and four men were pushed
roughly in. Behind them, the door was slammed and bolted.</p>

<p>One of the four men was Stanley Wood. At sight of Tarzan he
voiced an exclamation of astonishment. "Clayton!" he cried.
"Where did you come from? What in the world are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"The same thing that you are&mdash;waiting to be killed."</p>

<p>"How did he get you? I thought you were immune&mdash;that he
couldn't control you."</p>

<p>Tarzan explained about the misadventure of the leopard pit;
then Wood introduced the other three to him. They were Robert van
Eyk, Wood's associate, and Troll and Spike, the two white hunters
who had accompanied their safari. Troll he had already met.</p>

<p>"I ain't had a chance to tell Wood about seeing you,"
explained Troll. "This is the first time I've seen him. He was in
the cooler, and I was just arrested. I don't even know what for,
or what they're goin' to do to me."</p>

<p>"I can tell you what they plan on doing to you," said Tarzan.
"We're all to be killed. Mafka just told me. He says you are all
troublemakers."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't have to be a psychoanalyst to figure that out,"
remarked van Eyk. "If we'd had half a break we'd've shown him
something in the trouble line, but what you going to do up
against a bird like that? He knows what you're thinking before
you think it."</p>

<p>"We wouldn't have been in this mess if it hadn't been for Wood
messin' around with that Gonfala dame," growled Spike. "I never
knew it to fail that you didn't get into trouble with any bunch
of heathen if you started mixin' up with their women
folk&mdash;especially niggers. But a guy's got it comin' to him
that plays around with a nigger wench."</p>

<p>"Shut that dirty trap of yours," snapped Wood, "or I'll shut
it for you." He took a quick step toward Spike and swung a
vicious right for the other man's jaw. Spike stepped back and van
Eyk jumped between them.</p>

<p>"Cut it!" he ordered. "We got enough grief without fighting
among ourselves."</p>

<p>"You're dead right," agreed Troll. "We'll punch the head of
the next guy that starts anything like that again."</p>

<p>"That's all right, too," said Wood; "but Spike's got to
apologize or I'll kill him for that the first chance I get. He's
got to take it back."</p>

<p>"You'd better apologize, Spike," advised van Eyk.</p>

<p>The hunter looked sullenly from beneath lowering brows. Troll
went over and whispered to him. "All right," said Spike, finally;
"I take it back. I didn't mean nothin'."</p>

<p>Wood nodded. "Very well," he said, "I accept your apology,"
and turned and joined Tarzan, who had been standing by a window a
silent spectator of what had transpired.</p>

<p>He stood for a time in silence; then he shook his head
dejectedly. "The trouble is," he said in low tones, "I know Spike
is right. She must have negro blood in her&mdash;they all have;
but it doesn't seem to make any difference to me&mdash;I'm just
plain crazy about her, and that's all there is to it. If you
could only see her, you'd understand."</p>

<p>"I have seen her," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Wood. "You've seen her? When?"</p>

<p>"Shortly after I was brought here," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You mean she came here to see you?"</p>

<p>"She was on the throne with Mafka when I was taken before
him," explained Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I see. I thought maybe you'd talked with her."</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;afterward, in her apartment. I found a way to get
there."</p>

<p>"What did she say? How was she? I haven't seen her since I got
back. I was afraid something had happened to her."</p>

<p>"Mafka suspects her of helping you to escape. He keeps her
locked up under guard."</p>

<p>"Did she say anything about me?" demanded Wood, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes; she wants to help you. At first she was eager and
friendly; then, quite abruptly and seemingly with no reason, she
became sullen and dangerous, screaming for her guard."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was like that&mdash;sweet and lovely one moment; and
the next, a regular she-devil. I never could understand it. Do
you suppose she's&mdash;well, not quite right mentally?"</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head. "No," he said, "I don't think
that. I believe there is another explanation. But that is neither
here nor there now. There is just one matter that should concern
us&mdash;getting out of here. We don't know when Mafka plans on
putting us out of the way nor how. Whatever we are going to do we
should do immediately&mdash;take him by surprise."</p>

<p>"How are we going to surprise him&mdash;locked up here in a
room, under guard?" demanded Wood.</p>

<p>"You'd be surprised," replied Tarzan, smiling faintly; "so
will Mafka. Tell me, can we count on any help beyond what we can
do ourselves&mdash;the five of us? How about the other prisoners?
Will they join with us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, practically all of them&mdash;if they can. But what can
any of us do against Mafka? We're beaten before we start. If we
could only get hold of the Gonfal! I think that's the source of
all his power over us."</p>

<p>"We might do that, too," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Wood. "What do you think, Bob?" he asked
van Eyk, who had just joined them.</p>

<p>"Not a chance in a million," replied van Eyk. "He keeps the
old rock in his own apartment at night, or in fact wherever he is
the Gonfal is with him. His apartment is always locked and
guarded&mdash;warriors at the door all the time. No, we never
could get it."</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to Wood. "I thought you told me once that they
seemed very careless of the Gonfal&mdash;that you had handled
it."</p>

<p>Wood grinned. "I thought I had, but since I came back I
learned differently. One of the women told me. It seems that
Mafka is something of a chemist. He has a regular lab and plays
around in it a lot&mdash;ordinary chemistry as well as his main
line of black magic. Well, he learned how to make phony diamonds;
so he makes an imitation of the Gonfal, and that's what I
handled. They say he leaves the phony out where it can be seen
and hides the real Gonfal at night when he goes to bed; so that
if, by any chance, some one was able to get into his room to
steal it they'd get the wrong stone. But he has to keep the
Gonfal near him just the same, or he'd be more or less helpless
against an enemy."</p>

<p>"The only chance to get it would be to get into Mafka's
apartment at night," said van Eyk, "and that just can't be
done."</p>

<p>"Do his apartments connect with Gonfala's?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes, but the old boy keeps the door between them locked at
night. He isn't taking any chances&mdash;not even with
Gonfala."</p>

<p>"I think we can get into Mafka's apartment," said the ape-man.
"I'm going now to find out."</p>

<p>"Going!" exclaimed Wood. "I'd like to know how."</p>

<p>"Don't let anyone follow me," cautioned the ape-man. "I'll be
back."</p>

<p>The two Americans shook their heads skeptically as Tarzan
turned away and crossed the room; then they saw him enter the
fireplace and disappear.</p>

<p>"Well I'll be damned!" exclaimed van Eyk. "Who is that guy,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"An Englishman named Clayton," replied Wood. "At least that's
all I know about him, and that came direct from him."</p>

<p>"If there were such a bird as Tarzan of the Apes, I'd say this
was he," said van Eyk.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought when I first met him. Say, he flits
through the trees like a regular Tarzan, kills his meat with a
bow and arrow, and packs it back to camp on his shoulder through
the trees."</p>

<p>"And now look what he's done! Up the flue like a-a-well, like
something, whatever it is goes up a flue."</p>

<p>"Smoke," suggested Wood; "only he's coming back, and smoke
doesn't&mdash;except occasionally."</p>

<p><br>
TARZAN followed the corridor as he had before until he came to
the opening into Gonfala's chamber; then he retraced his steps a
short distance and felt his way back again with his right hand
touching the side of the passageway instead of his left as
before; nor was he surprised to discover that the tunnel ran on
past the apartment of Gonfala. It was what he had
expected&mdash;what he had been banking his hopes upon.</p>

<p>Now, past the opening that led to Gonfala's room, he touched
the left-hand wall again and, pacing off the distance roughly,
came to another opening that he judged would be about opposite
the center of the next apartment, which was one of Mafka's suite.
He did not stop here, but went on until he had located three more
openings. Here the corridor ended.</p>

<p>He stepped to the edge of the flue and looked down into the
fireplace. It was night now, but a faint illumination came from
the opening below him. It was a greenish glow, now all too
familiar.</p>

<p>He listened. He heard the snores of a heavy sleeper. Was there
another in the apartment below, or was the sleeper alone? His
sensitive nostrils sought an answer.</p>

<p>With the dagger of Gonfala in one hand, Tarzan dropped lightly
to the floor of the fireplace that opened into the room where the
sleeper lay.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; TOWARD
FREEDOM</a></h2>

<p class="first">BEFORE him was a large chamber with a single
door, heavily bolted upon the inside. He who slept there quite
evidently slept in fear. It was Mafka. He lay upon a narrow cot.
Upon a table at one side rested the Gonfal and the great emerald
of the Zuli and beside them a cutlass and a dagger. Similar
weapons lay on a table at the other side of the cot. All were
within easy reach of the sleeper. A single cresset burned upon
one of the tables.</p>

<p>Tarzan crossed noiselessly to the side of the cot and removed
the weapons; first upon one side; then the other. Next, he
carried the great emerald and the Gonfal to the fireplace and put
them upon the ledge at the mouth of the corridor; then he
returned to the side of the cot. Mafka slept on, for the ape-man
moved as silently as a ghost in the night.</p>

<p>He laid a hand upon the shoulder of the magician and shook him
lightly. Mafka awoke with a start.</p>

<p>"Keep still and you will not be harmed." Tarzan's voice was
low, but it was the voice of authority that knew its power.</p>

<p>Mafka looked wildly about the apartment as though searching
for help, but there was none.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" His voice trembled. "Tell me what you want
and it is yours, if you will not kill me."</p>

<p>"I do not kill old men or women or children unless they force
me to. As long as my life is safe, yours is."</p>

<p>"Then why have you come here? What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that you can give me. What I want, I take."</p>

<p>He turned Mafka over on his stomach and bound his wrists, his
ankles, and his knees with strips torn from the bedding; then he
gagged him so that he could not raise an alarm. He also
blindfolded him that he might not see how entrance had been
gained to his apartment.</p>

<p>These things done, he returned to the corridor and groped his
way back to Gonfala's apartment, leaving the two great gems where
he had first placed them. He was confident they would never be
found by another than himself, so sure was he that these
corridors were entirely unknown to the present occupants of the
palace.</p>

<p>At the entrance to Gonfala's apartment he listened again, but
his senses detected no presence in the room below. As he entered
it, a quick glance assured him that it was vacant. A single small
cresset lighted it dimly. A door at the far end of the room was
ajar. He went to it and pushed it open.</p>

<p>As he did so, Gonfala sat up in her couch near the center of
the room and faced him. "You have come back! I hoped you would.
You have chosen a good time."</p>

<p>"I thought so&mdash;he sleeps."</p>

<p>"Then you know?"</p>

<p>"I guessed."</p>

<p>"But why have you come back?"</p>

<p>"Wood and his three friends are prisoners. They are all to be
killed."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. It is by my orders." A qualm of pain and self-
disgust was registered in her expression.</p>

<p>"You can help them to escape. Will you?"</p>

<p>"It would do no good. He would only drag them back, and their
punishment would be even worse than they can expect now. It is
hopeless."</p>

<p>"If Mafka did not interfere would the women obey you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And if you had the opportunity you would like to escape from
Kaji?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where would you go?"</p>

<p>"To England."</p>

<p>"Why to England?"</p>

<p>"One who was always good to me, but who is dead now, told me
to go to England if ever I escaped. He gave me a letter to take
with me."</p>

<p>"Well, get your letter and get ready. You are going to escape.
We will be back for you in a little while&mdash;Wood and his
friends and I. But you will have to help. You will have to give
the necessary orders to the women to let us all pass."</p>

<p>She shook her head emphatically. "It will do no good, I tell
you. He will get us all."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that. Just give me your promise that you
will do as I ask."</p>

<p>"I'll promise, but it will mean death for me as well as for
you."</p>

<p>"Get ready, then; I'll be back with the others in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>He left her room, closing the door after him, and went at once
to the corridor. A moment later he dropped into the room where
Wood and his companions were imprisoned. It was very dark. He
spoke to them in low tones, directing them to follow him. Soon
they were all in the corridor.</p>

<p>Tarzan led the way to Mafka's room, the glow from the great
gems lighting their way as they approached the end of the
corridor.</p>

<p>Spike drew in his breath in astonishment. "Gripes! The big
rock!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Troll halted before the radiant stones and gazed at them in
fascinated silence for a moment. "This other&mdash;it must be the
great emerald of the Zuli. Both of 'em! Lord! They must be worth
millions." He started to touch them, but drew back in terror. He
knew the power that lay in them, and feared it.</p>

<p>Tarzan dropped over the ledge into the fireplace then, and the
others followed him. As they gathered around Mafka's couch, Wood
and his companions were speechless with astonishment when they
saw the old magician lying bound and helpless.</p>

<p>"How did you do it?" exclaimed Wood.</p>

<p>"I took the gems away from him first. I think all his power
lies in them. If I am right, we can get away from here. If I'm
wrong&mdash;" The ape-man shrugged.</p>

<p>Van Eyk nodded. "I think you're right. What are we going to do
with this old devil?"</p>

<p>Troll seized one of the cutlasses that lay beside the cot.
"I'll show you what we're going to do with him!"</p>

<p>Tarzan grasped the man's wrist. "Not so fast. You are taking
orders from me."</p>

<p>"Who said so?"</p>

<p>Tarzan wrenched the weapon from Troll's hand and slapped the
man across the side of the face with an open palm. The blow sent
him reeling across the room to fall in a heap against the
wall.</p>

<p>Troll staggered to his feet, feeling his jaw. "I'll get you
for this." His voice trembled with rage.</p>

<p>"Shut up and do as you're told." The ape-man's voice showed no
emotion. It was, however, a voice that commanded obedience. Then
he turned to Wood. "You and van Eyk get the gems. Troll and Spike
will carry Mafka."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" Van Eyk put the question apprehensively.
He knew that there was a guard of warrior-women in the corridor
outside Mafka's suite.</p>

<p>"We are going first to Gonfala's apartments. They adjoin
Mafka's."</p>

<p>"She'll give the alarm, and we'll have the whole bloomin'
bunch of 'em on us," objected Spike.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about Gonfala; just do as I say. However, you may
as well take these weapons. Something might happen of
course."</p>

<p>Wood and van Eyk got the great emerald and the Gonfal from the
ledge in the fireplace; then Troll and Spike picked up Mafka, who
was trembling in terror; and all followed Tarzan to the door of
the apartment. They passed through the adjoining room and the
next, coming then to the door leading into Gonfala's suite. Like
the other doors, it was barred on the inside. Slipping the bars,
the ape-man pushed the door open.</p>

<p>Gonfala was standing in the center of the room as the party
entered. She was clothed as for a journey, with a long robe of
leopard skins and heavy sandals. A narrow fillet of beaded
doeskin bound her golden hair. At sight of Mafka, bound, gagged,
and blindfolded, she gasped and shrank away. Then she saw Wood
and ran to him.</p>

<p>He put an arm about her. "Don't be afraid, Gonfala. We're
going to take you away. That is, if you want to come with
us."</p>

<p>"Yes; anywhere&mdash;with you. But him! What are you going to
do with him?" She pointed at Mafka. "He'll drag us all back, no
matter where we go, and kill us; or he'll kill us there. He kills
them all, who escape."</p>

<p>Spike spat venomously. "We'd ought to kill him now."</p>

<p>Van Eyk looked at Tarzan. "I agree with Spike. Why shouldn't
we, when it's his life or ours?"</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head. "We don't know the temper of the
Kaji women. This man must be something of a deity to them. He
represents their power&mdash;he <i>is</i> their power. Without
him, they would be just a tribe of women upon which any other
tribe could prey. He means most to us alive, as a hostage."</p>

<p>Wood nodded. "I think Clayton's right."</p>

<p>The discussion was interrupted by a commotion in the outer
corridor upon which the apartments of Mafka and Gonfala opened.
There was pounding upon the door of Mafka's apartment and loud
cries for the magician.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to Gonfala. "Call some warrior in authority and
see what they want. We'll wait in the next room. Come!" He
motioned the others to follow him, and led the way into the
adjoining apartment.</p>

<p>Gonfala crossed the room and struck a drum that stood upon the
floor near the doorway leading into the corridor. Three times she
struck it; then she drew the bolt that secured the door upon the
inside. A moment later the door was swung open, and a warrior-
woman entered the apartment. She bent to one knee before the
queen.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of the noise in the corridor? Why are
they calling Mafka at this hour of the morning?"</p>

<p>"The Zuli are coming, Gonfala. They are coming to make war
upon us. They sent a slave to demand the return of their great
emerald. There are many of them. We invoke the power of Mafka to
make the Zuli weak so that we can kill many of them and drive
them away."</p>

<p>"They have no power. Woora is dead, and we have the great
emerald. Tell the warriors that I, Gonfala the Queen, command
them to go out and slay the Zuli."</p>

<p>"The Zuli are already at the gates of the city. Our warriors
are afraid, for they have no power from Mafka. Where is Mafka?
Why does he not answer the prayers of the Kaji?"</p>

<p>Gonfala stamped her foot. "Do as I command. You are not here
to ask questions. Go to the gate and defend the city. I, Gonfala,
will give my warriors power to defeat the Zuli."</p>

<p>"Let us see Mafka," insisted the woman sullenly.</p>

<p>Gonfala reached a quick decision. "Very well. See that my
orders for the defense of the city are obeyed; then come to the
throne room, and you shall see Mafka. Bring the captains with
you."</p>

<p>The woman withdrew, and the door was closed. Immediately,
Tarzan stepped into the room. "I overheard. What is your
plan?"</p>

<p>"Merely to gain time."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't intend to have Mafka in the throne room to
meet them?"</p>

<p>"No. That would be fatal. If we took him in bound, gagged, and
blindfolded they might kill us all. If we gave him his freedom,
he would kill us."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I think it a good plan. We'll do it." A grim
smile touched the lips of the ape-man.</p>

<p>"You are mad."</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but if we try to leave now, we can't get out of Kaji
without a fight; and I do not relish fighting women. I think
there is another way. Do you know where the imitation Gonfal is
kept?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Get it, and bring it here at once. Wrap a skin around it so
that no one can see it. Tell no one. Only you and I must
know."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see. Do as I tell you."</p>

<p>"You forget that I am queen." She drew herself up proudly.</p>

<p>"I know only that you are a woman who would like to escape
from Kaji with the man she loves."</p>

<p>Gonfala flushed, but she made no reply. Instead, she quit the
room at once, going into the apartments of Mafka.</p>

<p>She was gone but a few moments. When she returned she carried
a bundle wrapped in a skin.</p>

<p>Tarzan took it from her. "We are ready now. Lead the way to
the throne room." He summoned the others from the adjoining
apartment; then he turned again to the queen. "Is there a private
way to the throne room?"</p>

<p>Gonfala nodded. "This way. Follow me."</p>

<p>She led them into Mafka's apartments where she opened a small
door revealing a flight of steps, and they followed her down
these to another door that opened upon the dais where the throne
chairs stood.</p>

<p>The throne room was empty. The captains had not yet arrived.
At Tarzan's direction, Wood placed the Gonfal on the stand beside
the throne; Troll and Spike seated Mafka, still bound, gagged,
and blindfolded, in his chair; Gonfala seated herself in the
other. Tarzan stood beside the table bearing the Gonfal. The
others stood behind the chairs. Van Eyk concealed the great
emerald of the Zuli beneath a skin he took from the floor of the
dais.</p>

<p>In silence they waited. All but Tarzan were tense with
nervousness. Presently they heard approaching footfalls in the
corridor leading to the throne room. The doors were swung open,
and the captains of the Kaji filed in.</p>

<p>They came with heads bent in reverence for their queen and the
great power of their magician. When they looked up they were
close to the dais. At sight of Mafka they gave vent to cries of
astonishment and anger. They looked at the strangers on the dais;
then their eyes centered upon the queen.</p>

<p>One of them stepped forward. "What is the meaning of this,
Gonfala?" Her tones were menacing.</p>

<p>It was Tarzan who answered. "It means that the power of Mafka
is gone. All your lives he has held you in the hollow of his
hand. He has made you fight for him. He has taken the best fruits
of your conquests. He has held you prisoners here. You feared and
hated him, but most of all you feared him."</p>

<p>"He has given us power," answered the warrior. "If that power
is gone, we are lost."</p>

<p>"It is not gone, but Mafka no longer wields it."</p>

<p>"Kill them!" cried one of the captains.</p>

<p>The cry arose from many throats. "Kill them! Kill them!" With
savage yells they pushed forward toward the dais.</p>

<p>Tarzan laid a hand upon the Gonfal. "Stop! Kneel before your
queen!" His voice was low. In the din of their shouting it
probably reached the ears of few if any of the warriors, but as
one they stopped and knelt.</p>

<p>Again the ape-man spoke. "Stand up! Go to the gates and bring
in the captains of the Zuli. They will come. The fighting will
stop." The warriors turned and filed out of the chamber.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned toward his companions. "It worked. I thought it
would. Whatever this strange power is, it is inherent in the
Gonfal. The great emerald has the same mystic power. In the hands
of vicious men it is bad. Perhaps, though, it may be used for
good."</p>

<p>Gonfala was listening intently. The sounds of the battle
ceased; then came echoing footfalls in the long corridor leading
to the palace entrance. "They come!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Fifty warrior women entered the throne room of the queen of
the Kaji. Half of them were Kaji and half Zuli. They were a
savage company. Many of them were bleeding from wounds. They
looked sullenly at one another and at the little company upon the
dais.</p>

<p>Tarzan faced them. "You are free now from the rule of Woora
and Mafka. Woora is dead. I shall turn Mafka over to you
presently to do with as you wish. His power is gone if you keep
the Gonfal from him. We are leaving your country. Gonfala is
going with us. As many prisoners and slaves as wish to accompany
us may come. When we are safely out we will hand the Gonfal back
to one of your warriors, who may accompany us with three
companions&mdash;no more. It is dawn. We leave at once. Here is
Mafka." He lifted the old magician in his arms and handed him
down to the warrior women.</p>

<p>Amidst deathly silence the little company of white men filed
out of the throne room with Gonfala the queen of the Kaji. Tarzan
carried the Gonfal so that all might see it. Van Eyk bore the
great emerald of the Zuli concealed beneath a wrapping of
skin.</p>

<p>In the main street of the city a little group of black men and
white awaited them, summoned by Tarzan through the necromancy of
the Gonfal. They were the slaves and prisoners of the Kaji.</p>

<p>"We are leaving this country," he told them; "any who wish to
may accompany us."</p>

<p>"Mafka will kill us," objected one.</p>

<p>Shrill screams issued from the interior of the palace only to
be drowned by savage yells of rage and hatred.</p>

<p>"Mafka will never kill again," said the ape-man.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; TREACHERY</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN peace they marched through the country of the
Kaji under the protection of Tarzan and the Gonfal. Those who had
been prisoners and slaves for years were filled with nervous
apprehension. They could not believe this miracle that had
seemingly snatched them from the clutches of the old magician who
had dominated and terrorized them for so long. Momentarily they
expected to be killed or dragged back to certain torture and
death; but nothing happened, and they came at last to the valley
of the Neubari.</p>

<p>"I'll leave you here," said Tarzan. "You will be going south.
I go north." He handed the Gonfal to van Eyk. "Keep it until
morning; then give it to one of these women." He indicated the
three warrior women who had accompanied them from Kaji; then he
turned to them. "Take the stone back; and if any among you can
use it, use it for good and not for evil.</p>

<p>"Wood, take the great emerald of the Zuli in trust for
Gonfala. I hope it will bring her happiness, but the chances are
that it will not. At least, however, she need never want."</p>

<p>"Where do we come in?" demanded Spike.</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head. "You don't; you go out&mdash;you
go out with your lives. That's a lot more than you could have
hoped for a few days ago."</p>

<p>"You mean to say you're goin' to give the big rock back to the
niggers and we don't get no split? It ain't fair. Look what we
been through. You can't do it."</p>

<p>"It's already done."</p>

<p>Spike turned toward the others. "Are you fellows goin' to
stand for this?" he shouted angrily. "Them two rocks belongs to
all of us. We ought to take 'em back to London and sell 'em and
divide up equal."</p>

<p>"I'm glad enough to get out with my life," said van Eyk. "I
think Gonfala has a right to one of the stones; the other will be
plenty for both the Kaji and the Zuli to carry out their plans to
go out into the world. They'll be cheated out of most of it
anyway, but they'll get their wish."</p>

<p>"I think they ought to be divided," said Troll. "We ought to
get something out of this."</p>

<p>Some of the white men who had been liberated agreed with him.
Others said they only wanted to get home alive and the sooner
they saw the last of the two stones the better they'd be
satisfied.</p>

<p>"They're evil," said one of the men. "They'll bring no good to
anyone."</p>

<p>"I'd take the chance," growled Spike.</p>

<p>Tarzan regarded him coldly. "You won't get it. I've told you
all what to do; see that you do it. I'll be travelling south
again before you get out of the country. I'll know if you've
pulled anything crooked. See that you don't."</p>

<p><br>
NIGHT had fallen. The little band of fugitives, perhaps a
hundred strong, were making camp, such as it was, and preparing
the food they had brought from Kaji. The blacks, who had been
slaves, fell naturally into positions of porters and personal
servants to the whites. There had been some slight attempt toward
organization, Wood and van Eyk acting as lieutenants to the man
they knew only as Clayton, who had assumed the leadership as
naturally as the others had accepted the arrangement.</p>

<p>He stood among them now noting the preparations for the night;
then he turned to Wood. "You and van Eyk will take charge. You
will have no trouble unless it be from Spike. Watch him. Three
marches to the south you will find friendly villages. After that
it will be easy."</p>

<p>That was all. He turned and was gone into the night. There
were no farewells, long-drawn and useless.</p>

<p>"Well," said van Eyk, "that was casual enough."</p>

<p>Wood shrugged. "He is like that."</p>

<p>Gonfala strained her eyes out into the darkness. "He has gone?
You think he will not come back?"</p>

<p>"When he finishes whatever business he is on, perhaps. By that
time we may be out of the country."</p>

<p>"I felt so safe when he was with us." The girl came and stood
close to Wood. "I feel safe with you, too, Stanlee; but
him&mdash;he seemed a part of Africa."</p>

<p>The man nodded and put an arm about her. "We'll take care of
you, dear; but I know how you feel. I felt the same way when he
was around. I had no sense of responsibility at all, not even for
my own welfare. I just took it for granted that he'd look after
everything."</p>

<p>"I often wonder about him," said van Eyk musingly&mdash;"who
he is, where he comes from, what he is doing in Africa. I
wonder&mdash;I wonder if there could be&mdash;if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If what?"</p>

<p>"If there could be a Tarzan."</p>

<p>Wood laughed. "You know, the same thought came to me. Of
course, there is no such person; but this fellow, Clayton, sure
would fill the bill."</p>

<p>The black boy who was cooking for them called them then to the
evening meal. It was not much, and they decided that Spike and
Troll would have to do some hunting the following day.</p>

<p>Suddenly Wood laughed&mdash;a bit ruefully. "What with?" he
demanded. "We've got spears and knives. What could any of us kill
with those?"</p>

<p>Van Eyk nodded. "You're right. What are we going to do? We've
got to have meat. All the way to those first friendly villages
we've got to depend on game. There won't be anything else."</p>

<p>"If we raise any game, we'll have to send out beaters and
chase it toward the spears. We ought to get something that
way."</p>

<p>Van Eyk grinned. "If we're lucky enough to raise something
with <em>angina pectoris</em>, the excitement might kill it."</p>

<p>"Well, they do kill big game with spears," insisted Wood.</p>

<p>Van Eyk's face brightened. He snapped his fingers. "I've got
it! Bows and arrows! Some of our blacks must be good at making
them and using them. Hey, Kamudi! Come here!"</p>

<p>One of the black boys arose from the two calloused black heels
he had been squatting upon and approached. "Yes, Bwana&mdash;you
call?"</p>

<p>"Say, can any of you boys kill game with a bow and arrow?"</p>

<p>Kamudi grinned. "Yes, Bwana."</p>

<p>"How about making them? Can any of you make bows and
arrows?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana&mdash;all can make."</p>

<p>"Fine! Any of the stuff you use grow around here?" Van Eyk's
tones were both eager and apprehensive.</p>

<p>"Down by the river&mdash;plenty."</p>

<p>"Gee! That's bully. When the boys have finished supper take
'em down there and get enough stuff to make bows for every one
and lots of arrows. Make a few tonight. If we don't have 'em, we
don't eat tomorrow. Sabe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana&mdash;after supper."</p>

<p>The night was velvet soft. A full moon shone down upon the
camp, paling the embers of dying fires where the men had cooked
their simple meal. The blacks were busy fashioning crude bows and
arrows, roughly hewn but adequate.</p>

<p>The whites were gathered in little groups. A shelter had been
fashioned for Gonfala; and before this she and Wood and van Eyk
lay upon skins that had been brought from Kaji and talked of the
future. Gonfala of the wonders that awaited her in unknown
civilization, for she was going to London. The men spoke of
America, of their families, and old friends, who must long ago
have given them up as dead.</p>

<p>"With the proceeds from the great emerald of the Zuli you will
be a very rich woman, Gonfala." Wood spoke a little regretfully.
"You will have a beautiful home, wonderful gowns and furs,
automobiles, and many servants; and there will be men&mdash;oh,
lots of men."</p>

<p>"Why should I have men? I do not want but just one."</p>

<p>"But they will want you, for yourself and for your money." The
thought seemed to sadden Wood.</p>

<p>"You will have to be very careful," said van Eyk. "Some of
those chaps will be very fascinating."</p>

<p>The girl shrugged. "I am not afraid. Stanlee will take care of
me. Won't you, Stanlee?"</p>

<p>"If you'll let me, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'But' what?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see you have never known men such as you are going
to meet. You may find someone who&mdash;" Wood hesitated.</p>

<p>"'Someone who' what?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Whom you'll like better than you do me."</p>

<p>Gonfala laughed. "I am not worrying."</p>

<p>"But I am."</p>

<p>"You needn't." The girl's eyes swam with the moisture of
adulation.</p>

<p>"You are so young and naive and inexperienced. You haven't the
slightest idea what you are going to be up against or the types
of men there are in the world&mdash;especially in the civilized
world."</p>

<p>"Are they as bad as Mafka?"</p>

<p>"In a different way they are worse."</p>

<p>Van Eyk stood up and stretched. "I'm going to get some sleep,"
he said. "You two'd better do the same thing. Good night."</p>

<p>They said good night to him and watched him go; then the girl
turned to Wood. "I am not afraid," she said, "and you must not
be. We shall have each other, and as far as I am concerned, no
one else in the world counts."</p>

<p>He took her hand and stroked it. "I hope you will always feel
that way, dear. It is the way I feel&mdash;it is the way I always
shall."</p>

<p>"Nothing will ever come between us then." She turned her palm
beneath his and pressed his fingers.</p>

<p>For a little time longer they talked and planned as lovers
have from time immemorial; and then he went to lie down at a
little distance, and Gonfala to her shelter; but she could not
sleep. She was too happy. It seemed to her that she could not
waste a moment of that happiness in sleep, lose minutes of
rapture that she could not ever recall.</p>

<p>After a moment she got up and went into the night. The camp
slept. The moon had dropped into the west, and the girl walked in
the dense shadow of the ancient trees against which the camp had
been made. She moved slowly and silently in the state of beatific
rapture that was engendered not alone by her love but by the
hitherto unknown sense of freedom that had come to her with
release from the domination of Mafka.</p>

<p>No longer was she subject to the hated seizures of cruelty and
vindictiveness that she now realized were no true characteristics
of her own but states that had been imposed upon her by the
hypnotic powers of the old magician.</p>

<p>She shuddered as she recalled him. Perhaps he was her father,
but what of it? What of a father's love and tenderness had he
ever given her? She tried to forgive him; she tried to think a
kindly thought of him; but no, she could not. She had hated him
in life; in death she still hated his memory.</p>

<p>With an effort she shook these depressing recollections from
her and sought to center her thoughts on the happiness that was
now hers and that would be through a long future.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware of voices near her. "The bloke's
balmy. The nerve of him, givin' the Gonfal back to them niggers.
We ort to have it an' the emerald, too. Think of it,
Troll&mdash;nearly five million pounds! That's wot them two
together would have brought in London or Paris."</p>

<p>"An he gives the emerald to that damn nigger wench. Wot'll she
do with it? The American'll get it. She thinks he's soft on her,
thinks he's goin' to marry her; but whoever heard of an American
marryin' a nigger. You're right, Spike; it's all wrong.
Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl did not wait to hear more. She turned and fled
silently through the darkness&mdash;her dream shattered, her
happiness blasted.</p>

<p><br>
WOOD awakened early and called Kamudi. "Wake the boys," he
directed; "we're making an early start." Then he called van Eyk,
and the two busied themselves directing the preparations for the
day's march. "We'll let Gonfala sleep as long as we can," he
said; "this may be a hard day."</p>

<p>Van Eyk was groping around in the dim light of early dawn,
feeling through the grasses on which he had made his bed.
Suddenly he ripped out an oath.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Wood.</p>

<p>"Stan, the Gonfal is gone! It was right under the edge of
these skins last night."</p>

<p>Wood made a hurried search about his own bed; then another,
more carefully. When he spoke he seemed stunned, shocked. "The
emerald's gone, too, Bob. Who could have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Kaji!" Van Eyk's voice rang with conviction.</p>

<p>Together the two men hurried to the part of the camp where the
warrior-women had bedded down for the night; and there, just
rising from the skins upon which they had slept, were the
three.</p>

<p>Without preliminaries, explanation, or apology the two men
searched the beds where the women had lain.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" demanded one of them.</p>

<p>"The Gonfal," replied van Eyk.</p>

<p>"You have it," said the woman, "not we."</p>

<p>The brief equatorial dawn had given way to the full light of
day as Wood and van Eyk completed a search of the camp and
realized that Spike and Troll were missing.</p>

<p>Wood looked crestfallen and hopeless. "We might have guessed
it right off," he said. "Those two were sore as pups when Clayton
gave the Gonfal back to the Kaji and the emerald to Gonfala."</p>

<p>"What'll we do?" asked van Eyk.</p>

<p>"We'll have to follow them, of course; but that's not what's
worrying me right now&mdash;it's telling Gonfala. She'd been
banking a lot on the sale of the emerald ever since we kept
harping on the wonderful things she could buy and what she could
do with so much money. Poor kid! Of course, I've got enough for
us to live on, and she can have every cent of it. But it won't be
quite the same to her, because she wanted so much to be
independent and not be a burden to me&mdash;as though she ever
could be a burden."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got to tell her; and you might as well get it
off your chest now as any time. If we're going after those birds,
we want to get started pronto."</p>

<p>"O.K." He walked to Gonfala's shelter and called her. There
was no response. He called again louder; and then again and
again, but with no results. Then he entered. Gonfala was not
there.</p>

<p>He came out, white and shaken. "They must have taken her, too,
Bob."</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "That would have been impossible
without disturbing us&mdash;if she had tried to arouse us."</p>

<p>Wood bridled angrily. "You mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Van Eyk interrupted and put a hand on the other's shoulder. "I
don't know any more about it than you, Stan. I'm just stating a
self-evident fact. You know it as well as I."</p>

<p>"But the inference."</p>

<p>"I can't help the inference either. They couldn't have taken
Gonfala by force without waking us; therefore either she went
with them willingly, or she didn't go with them at all."</p>

<p>"The latter's out of the question. Gonfala would never run
away from me. Why only last night we were planning on the future,
after we got married."</p>

<p>Van Eyk shook his head. "Have you ever really stopped to think
about what that would mean, Stan? What it would mean to you both
in the future&mdash;in America? I'm thinking just as much of her
happiness as yours, old man. I'm thinking of the Hell on earth
that would be your lot&mdash;hers and yours. You know as well as
I what one drop of colored blood does for a man or woman in the
great democracy of the U.S.A. You'd both be ostracized by the
blacks as well as the whites. I'm not speaking from any personal
prejudice; I'm just stating a fact. It's hard and cruel and
terrible, but it still remains a fact."</p>

<p>Wood nodded in sad acquiescence. There was no anger in his
voice as he replied. "I know it as well as you, but I'd go
through Hell for her. I'd live in Hell for her, and thank God for
the opportunity. I love her that much."</p>

<p>"Then there's nothing more to be said. If you feel that way
about it, I'm for you. I'll never mention it again, and if you
ever do marry it'll never change me toward either of you."</p>

<p>"Thanks, old man; I'm sure of it. And now let's get busy and
start after them."</p>

<p>"You still think they took her?"</p>

<p>"I have a theory. They have both the Gonfal and the great
emerald of the Zuli. You saw how Clayton used that mysterious
power to bend the Kaji and Zuli to his will. They used it to
compel Gonfala to accompany them without making any disturbance.
You know the experience I had. Mafka dragged me away from Clayton
in the same way."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right. I hadn't thought of that, but why did
they want Gonfala?"</p>

<p>Van Eyk looked uncomfortable, and the other noticed it. "You
don't mean&mdash;?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Van Eyk shrugged helplessly. "They are men," he said, "and not
very high types."</p>

<p>"We've got to find her&mdash;we've got to hurry!" Wood was
almost frantic.</p>

<p>Some of the blacks picked up the trail of the two men, leading
toward the south; and the manhunt was on.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; REUNION</a></h2>

<p class="first">TWO weeks rolled by. Tarzan was returning from
the north with the information he sought. Sometimes he thought of
the two Americans and Gonfala and the prisoners he had released
from the Kaji and wondered how they fared. There had been enough
of them to make their way in safety to the friendly tribes, and
after that it would have been very simple to reach the outposts
of civilization. He imagined that they were well on their way by
this time with a good safari of trained bearers and ample
provisions. He knew that the Americans were amply able to bear
the expense even if they were unable to finance themselves on the
security of the great emerald of the Zuli.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon as the Lord of the Jungle swung along a
game trail at the edge of a forest. A light wind was blowing in
his face, waving his black hair. It brought to his nostrils
evidence of things unseen that lay ahead. Presently it brought
the acrid scent of Numa the lion. It was an old lion, for the
odor was stronger than that of a cub or a young lion in its
prime.</p>

<p>To Tarzan it was just another lion. He gave it little thought
until the wind brought faintly to his nostrils another
scent&mdash;the scent spoor of a Tarmangani, a she&mdash;a white
woman. This scent came from the same direction as that of Numa.
The two, in conjunction, spelled tragedy.</p>

<p>Tarzan took to the trees. Game trails are winding. Through the
trees he could move in a straight line, shortening the distance
to his destination; and through the trees he could move with
incredible swiftness. They had been his natural element since
infancy when he had been borne swiftly from danger by his foster
mother, Kala the she-ape.</p>

<p><br>
THE woman, haggard, unkempt, starving, exhausted, moved slowly
and hopelessly along the trail. Her senses were dulled by fatigue
and suffering. She heard nothing, yet some inner sense prompted
her to turn a backward glance along the trail; then she saw the
lion. He was moving softly and slowly after her. When he saw that
he was discovered, he bared his fangs and growled.</p>

<p>The woman stopped and faced him. She had not the strength to
climb a tree to safety. She knew that flight was useless. She
just stood there, wide-eyed and hopeless, waiting for the end.
She did not care. She had nothing to live for. She only prayed
that death might come with merciful quickness.</p>

<p>When she had stopped, the lion had stopped. He stood glaring
at her, his eyes blazing. Suddenly he started toward her at a
trot. A few steps and he would charge&mdash;that swift, merciless
charge of the king of beasts that is the culmination of
ferocity.</p>

<p>He seemed to crouch lower, almost flattening himself against
the ground; and now a horrid roar burst from his savage throat as
he sprang forward!</p>

<p>The woman's eyes went wide, first in horror and then in
surprise; for as the lion charged, an almost naked man dropped
from an overhanging limb full upon the beast's back. She heard
the roars and growls of the man mingling with those of the beast,
and she shuddered. She saw a knife flash in the air, once, twice
again. Then, with a final hideous roar, the lion slumped to the
ground, dead.</p>

<p>The man leaped to his feet. It was then that she recognized
him, and a feeling of relief and a sense of security possessed
her. They endured for but a moment to be blasted by the hideous
victory cry of the bull ape as Tarzan placed a foot upon the
carcass of his kill and voiced the weird scream that had echoed
so many times through other forests and jungles, deserts and
plains.</p>

<p>Then his eyes dropped to the woman. "Gonfala! What has
happened? What are you doing here alone?"</p>

<p>She told him a little&mdash;just that she felt that she would
bring unhappiness into Wood's life and so had run away. She had
come north because she knew that he was going south. She had
hoped to find some village where they would take her in; but she
had found nothing; and so she had turned back intending to return
to Kaji and the only people that she knew as her own.</p>

<p>"You can't go back there," Tarzan told her. "Without Mafka's
protection, they would kill you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose they would; but where else may I go?"</p>

<p>"You are coming with me. Wood will save the emerald for you.
You will have all the money you will ever need. You can live then
where you wish in safety and comfort."</p>

<p>It was weeks before the ape-man brought the girl to his
home&mdash;to the commodious bungalow where his wife welcomed and
comforted her. All that time they had sought for word of Wood and
van Eyk and their party but had had none. Their total
disappearance seemed a mystery to Tarzan, and he planned to set
out presently to solve it. Time, however, means little to the
ape-man. There were other things to be done, and days passed. Yet
time itself was bringing the solution nearer.</p>

<p><br>
TWO white men with a small safari trekked through a grim
forest&mdash;damp, dark, depressing. It seemed endless.</p>

<p>"If ever two people were thoroughly and completely lost, we
are they." Wood had stopped and removed his sun helmet to wipe
the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>"We're no more lost than our guides," van Eyk reminded
him.</p>

<p>"If we keep on going east we ought to strike some village
where we can get guides."</p>

<p>"All right, let's get going."</p>

<p>Within half a mile they emerged from the forest at the edge of
a wide, rolling plain.</p>

<p>"What a relief!" exclaimed van Eyk. "A little more of that
forest and I'd have gone nuts."</p>

<p>"Look!" Wood seized his companion by the arm and pointed.
"Men!"</p>

<p>"Looks like a war party. See those plumes? Maybe we'd better
lay low."</p>

<p>"Well, the responsibility is no longer ours. They've seen us.
Here they come."</p>

<p>The two men stood watching a party of a dozen warriors
approaching them.</p>

<p>"Gee, they're a good-looking bunch," commented Wood.</p>

<p>"I hope they're also good."</p>

<p>The blacks halted a dozen paces from the white men; then one
who was evidently their leader approached closer.</p>

<p>"What are the bwanas doing in this country?" he asked in good
English. "Are they hunting?"</p>

<p>"We're lost," explained Wood. "We want to get guides to get us
out of here."</p>

<p>"Come," said the black. "I take you to the Big Bwana."</p>

<p>"What's his name?" asked van Eyk. "Perhaps we know him."</p>

<p>"He is Tarzan."</p>

<p>The two whites looked at one another in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me there really is a Tarzan?" demanded
Wood.</p>

<p>"Who ever tells you there isn't does not speak true words. In
an hour you shall see him."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Muviro, bwana."</p>

<p>"Well, lead on, Muviro; we're ready."</p>

<p>An hour later the two men stood on the broad veranda of a
sprawling bungalow waiting the coming of their host.</p>

<p>"Tarzan!" muttered van Eyk. "It doesn't seem possible. This
must be he coming."</p>

<p>They heard footsteps approaching from the interior of the
house, and a moment later a man stepped onto the veranda and
faced them.</p>

<p>"Clayton!" they both exclaimed in unison.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you," said Tarzan. "I hadn't been able to
get any word of you, and I was worried. Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"The night you left, Spike and Troll stole the Gonfal and the
great emerald and beat it. They took Gonfala with them. We have
been hunting for them. The very first day we lost their trail in
some rocky country. We never found it again. Some of our blacks
thought they had gone to the south and west. We searched in that
direction and got lost ourselves."</p>

<p>"The Gonfal and the great emerald are both gone? Well, perhaps
it is just as well. They would have brought more unhappiness than
anything else. Riches usually do."</p>

<p>"Hang the stones!" exclaimed Wood. "It is Gonfala I want to
find. I don't give a tinker's damn for either of the rocks."</p>

<p>"I think we shall find her. It is not difficult for me to find
anyone in Africa. But now I will have you shown to your rooms.
You will find a bath and clean clothes; among them something that
will fit you, I'm sure. When you are ready, come to the patio;
you will find us there."</p>

<p>Van Eyk was the first to enter the patio, a flowering paradise
around which the house was built. A golden haired girl lay on a
reed chaise lounge, a copy of the Illustrated London News in her
hand. Hearing him, she turned. Her eyes went wide in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Bob!" she gasped as she sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Gonfala!"</p>

<p>"Where is he? Is he all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is here. How did you escape from Spike and
Troll?"</p>

<p>"Escape from Spike and Troll? I was never with them."</p>

<p>"You went away alone? Why did you go?"</p>

<p>She told him then what she had overheard Spike and Troll say.
"I knew then that I would spoil Stanlee's life. I knew that he
loved me. I never thought that he wanted me just for the emerald.
And I loved him. I loved him too much to let him marry me.
Perhaps, when he had time to think it over, he was glad that I
went away."</p>

<p>Van Eyk shook his head. "No, you are very wrong. I spoke to
him of the matter; and here is what he said, as nearly as I can
recall his words: 'I'd go through Hell for her. I'd live in Hell
for her, and thank God for the opportunity. That is how much I
love her.' I think those were about his very words."</p>

<p>Tears came to the girl's eyes. "May I see him soon?"</p>

<p>"He'll be out in a minute. Here he comes now. I'll go."</p>

<p>She looked her thanks.</p>

<p>When Wood came into the patio and saw her, he just stood and
looked at her for a moment, devouring her with his eyes. He never
said a word or asked a question&mdash;just crossed to her and
took her in his arms. Their voices were too full of tears of
happiness for words.</p>

<p>After a while, when they could speak, each had the other's
story. After that they knew that nothing could ever come between
them.</p>

<p>In the evening, with the others, they were discussing their
plans for the future. Wood said they would be married and go at
once to America.</p>

<p>"I must go to London first," said Gonfala. "I have a letter to
take to the Colonial Office there. You know, I told you about it.
Let me get it. I cannot read it. I was never taught to read."</p>

<p>She went to her room and presently returned with the letter.
It was yellow with age. She handed it to Tarzan. "Please read it
aloud," she said. Tarzan opened the single sheet and read:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">To Whom it May Concern</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">"I am giving this letter to my daughter to take
to London to identify her if she is ever fortunate enough to
escape from the Kaji. They killed her mother shortly after she
was born and raised her to be queen of the Kaji. They call her
Gonfala. I have never dared to tell her that she is my daughter,
as Mafka has threatened to kill her if she ever learns that he is
not her father.</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Mountford</span>."</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; CANNIBALS</a></h2>

<p class="first">A LOW sun pointed long shadows toward the east;
the tired day was preparing to lay aside its burdens. Far away, a
lion roared. It was the prelude to another African night,
majestic as the king of beasts and as savage.</p>

<p>A party of eight men laid down their few belongings and made
camp beside a water hole. Two of the men were white. Like their
black companions they were armed with bows and arrows and short
spears; there was not a firearm among them all.</p>

<p>Some of the men carried meat from the last kill, and there
were two packages wrapped in skins. Beside their weapons, that
was all. It was a poorly equipped safari, if it could be said to
have been equipped at all.</p>

<p>The blacks were quiet, speaking in whispers as they cooked the
meat for their evening meal. The white men were glum and
scowling.</p>

<p>One of them nodded toward the blacks. "The beggars are scairt
stiff."</p>

<p>The other nodded. "Cannibal country, and they know it."</p>

<p>His companion sat scowling down at the two skin wrapped
packages for a long period of silence. "I'm a-scairt myself,
Troll," he said finally. "Scairt o' these things. I think they's
a curse on 'em."</p>

<p>Troll shrugged. "I could take a lot o' cursin' for six million
pun."</p>

<p>"Yeh; if we get out alive."</p>

<p>"I ain't worrit about that. What I'm worrit about is runnin'
into that bloke, Clayton. He'll take the rocks away from us."</p>

<p>"He went north."</p>

<p>"But he said he was comin' back, an' he said he'd know if we'd
pulled anything crooked. I don't like that bloke."</p>

<p>They lapsed into silence, chewing on the half cooked meat of a
tough old boar the blacks had killed the day before. From the
forest, a spur of which ran down almost to the water hole, eyes
watched them. Again the lion roared.</p>

<p>"The beggar's gettin' closer," remarked Spike. "I hopes he
ain't no man-eater."</p>

<p>Troll fidgeted. "Shut up!" he growled. "Can't you think of
somethin' pleasant for a change?"</p>

<p>"Bein' way out here without no gun'd make any bloke nervous.
Look at them damn things!" He kicked his bow and bundle of arrows
that lay at his feet. "I might kill a rabbit with 'em&mdash;if I
could hit 'im; but I couldn't hit a elephant if he stood still at
ten paces&mdash;and you know wot kind of a target a lion makes
when he charges."</p>

<p>"Oh, fer cripe's sake, shut up!"</p>

<p>Again they lapsed into silence. The shadow of the forest
covered them and stretched out across the plain, for the sun had
all but set. Suddenly there was a frightened cry of, "Bwana!
Look!" One of the blacks was pointing toward the forest.</p>

<p>The white men wheeled as they rose to their feet. Coming
toward them were a dozen black warriors. Spike stooped to pick up
his bow and arrows.</p>

<p>"Lay off!" warned Troll. "They ain't enough of us&mdash;an'
anyways they may be friendly." Spike stood erect again with empty
hands. One by one the blacks of their party rose slowly to their
feet.</p>

<p>The strangers were approaching cautiously, their weapons
ready. They halted a dozen paces from the camp, their grim
visaged leader in advance of the others. He surveyed the two
white men and their six bearers arrogantly, contemptuously. Troll
made the sign of peace.</p>

<p>The leader strode forward followed by his warriors. "What you
do here in the country of the Bantango?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"We look for guides," replied Troll in the same dialect. "Big
safari behind us&mdash;many guns&mdash;they come soon; then we
go. We wait here they come."</p>

<p>"You lie," said the chief. "My man one he follow you two days;
then he come me. No big safari. No guns. You lie."</p>

<p>"Wot did I tell you?" demanded Spike. "They's a curse on
us&mdash;an' look at them filed teeth. You know what them filed
teeth mean."</p>

<p>"I told you it was cannibal country," observed Troll,
lamely.</p>

<p>"Gawdamighty, I'd give both them rocks for a gun," moaned
Spike.</p>

<p>"The rocks!" exclaimed Troll. "That's it! Why didn't we think
o' that before?"</p>

<p>"Think o' what?"</p>

<p>"The Gonfal. We can use it like old Mafka did, just put a hand
on it an' make any bloke do wotever you wants him to do."</p>

<p>"Slime! That's a idea. Make 'em get out o' here." He stopped
and started to unwrap the Gonfal, the great diamond of the
Kaji.</p>

<p>The chief took a step forward. "What you got?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Big medicine," said Troll. "You like see?"</p>

<p>The chief nodded. "Me like, me take."</p>

<p>The swift equatorial night had fallen. Only the cooking fires
of the little camp illuminated the tense scene. From the deep
shadows a great lion watched.</p>

<p>Spike undid the thongs that bound the wrappings to the Gonfal,
and with trembling hands threw back the skin revealing the great
stone shimmering and scintillating in the dancing lights of the
cooking fires. The chief recoiled with a short gasp of
astonishment. He did not know what the stone was, but its
brilliance awed him.</p>

<p>Troll dropped to one knee beside the Gonfal and laid a hand on
it. "Go away!" he said to the chief. "Lay down your weapons, all
of you; and go away!"</p>

<p>The chief and his warriors stood looking at the Gonfal and at
Troll. They did not lay down their weapons and they did not go
away. As nothing happened, they regained confidence.</p>

<p>"No lay down weapons; no go away," said the chief. "We stay.
Me take." He pointed at Gonfal. "You come our village. You b'long
me."</p>

<p>"You better go away," insisted Troll. He tried to make his
voice sound commanding, but it did not.</p>

<p>"Wot's wrong with the Gonfal?" demanded Spike.</p>

<p>"It won't work."</p>

<p>"Le'me try it." Spike stooped and placed a palm on the stone.
"You blokes drop your weapons an' beat it before our big medicine
kills you," he shouted threateningly.</p>

<p>The chief stepped forward and kicked Spike in the face,
bowling him over on his back. His warriors rushed in with loud
war cries, brandishing their weapons. And then from the outer
darkness came a thunderous roar that shook the earth, and a great
lion charged into the savage melee.</p>

<p>He leaped over the prostrate Spike and brushed past Troll,
falling upon the terrified chief and his warriors.</p>

<p>Troll was quick to grasp the opportunity for escape. He
gathered up the great diamond, and shouted to Spike and the
bearers to follow him and bring the other stone; then he ran for
the forest.</p>

<p>A few screams, mingled with savage growls, rang in their ears
for brief moments; then silence.</p>

<p>All night they followed close to the edge of the forest, nor
did they stop until they came upon a small stream shortly after
daylight. Then they threw themselves upon the ground,
exhausted.</p>

<p>As they chewed once more upon the flesh of the old boar their
spirits revived, and they spoke for the first time for hours.</p>

<p>"I guess we don't know how to work the rock," ventured
Troll.</p>

<p>"Who says 'we'?" demanded Spike. "I worked it."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Didn't I tell 'em they'd get killed if they didn't beat
it? And wot happens? The Gonfal calls the old maneater. You
remember that lamp that bloke used to rub&mdash;I forget his
name&mdash;but this works just the same for me. I rubs it and
wishes&mdash;and there you are!"</p>

<p>"Rats!"</p>

<p>"A'right; didn't I do it?"</p>

<p>"No. That lion was comin' long before you touched the rock. He
smelled meat&mdash;that was wot brought him, not you and your
bloody rock."</p>

<p>"I'll show you. Here, give it to me."</p>

<p>Spike took the diamond from Troll, uncovered it, and placed a
palm on its gleaming surface. He glowered fixedly at his
companion.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" he commanded.</p>

<p>Troll grinned derisively and advised Spike to "Go to 'ell."
The latter scratched his head in momentary confusion; then he
brightened. "'Ere," he exclaimed; "I got a better idea." He
scratched a line on the ground with a bit of stick. "I says now
that you can't cross that line&mdash;and you can't."</p>

<p>"Who says I can't?" demanded Troll, stepping across the
line.</p>

<p>"I guess maybe there's something I don't understand about
this," admitted Spike. "That Clayton bloke worked it on the Kaji
and the Zuli. You seen him yourself."</p>

<p>"Gonfala was there," reminded Troll. "Maybe that's the answer.
Maybe it won't work without her."</p>

<p>"Maybe," admitted Spike; "but the Zuli medicine man done the
same work with the emerald, an' he didn't have no Gonfala."</p>

<p>"Well, try the emerald, then."</p>

<p>"Le'me have it."</p>

<p>"I ain't got it."</p>

<p>"One of the boys must have it."</p>

<p>"I told you to bring it."</p>

<p>"One of the boys always carries it," insisted Spike turning to
the bearers sprawled on the ground. "Hey, you! W'ich one o' you
's got the green rock?" They looked at him blankly; then they
looked at one another.</p>

<p>"No got," said one. "No bring."</p>

<p>"Hell!" ejaculated Troll. "You're a rare un, you are, aleavin'
maybe a three million pun stone back there in the cannibal
country!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; KIDNAPPED</a></h2>

<p class="first">"TIRED?" asked Wood.</p>

<p>Gonfala shook her head. "Not a bit."</p>

<p>"You're doing pretty well for a girl who never had to do
anything more strenuous than sit on a throne," laughed van
Eyk.</p>

<p>"You'd be surprised. I can probably out-run and out-last
either of you. You see I used to hunt with the Kaji. Mafka
insisted on it&mdash;lots of exercise. He was a great believer in
exercise for every one but Mafka."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," said Wood, "for we've got two long marches between
this camp and railhead. I'll be glad when it's over. To tell you
the truth, I'm fed up on Africa. I hope I never see it
again."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you, Stanlee; you came near staying here a long
time."</p>

<p>"Yes; eternity is rather a long time." Wood grimaced. "It's
hard to realize, even now, that we escaped."</p>

<p>"It's incredible," agreed Gonfala. "We're the first persons
ever to escape from Mafka; and he'd been there, oh, no one knows
how long&mdash;the Kaji said always. They believed that he
created the world."</p>

<p>The three were camped at the end of a day's march on their way
out toward civilization. They had a dependable, well equipped
safari furnished by Tarzan. The men planned on devoting one day
to hunting, as they were in excellent game country; then they
would cover the two long marches to railhead. The delay for
hunting was Wood's concession to van Eyk, an indefatigable
Nimrod, who had obtained permission from the Lord of the Jungle
to take out a few trophies for his collection.</p>

<p>As night fell, the light of their beast fire cast dancing
shadows through the camp and shone far out into the night, both
attracting and repelling the great carnivores upon whose domain
they trespassed; for this was lion country. It attracted also
other eyes a mile or more to the north.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that might be," said Spike.</p>

<p>"A fire," growled Troll; "what you think it was&mdash;a
iceberg?"</p>

<p>"Funny, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Not as funny as a bloke what runs off an leaves three million
puns worth o' emerald with a bunch of cannibals."</p>

<p>"Fer cripe's sake quit chewin' about that; I didn't leave it
any more 'n you did. What I mean is, there must be men over by
that fire; I wonders who they might be."</p>

<p>"Natives, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Or white hunters."</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" asked Troll.</p>

<p>"They might put us on the right trail."</p>

<p>"An' tell that Clayton bloke where we are? You're balmy."</p>

<p>"How do you know he's around here? Maybe they never even heard
of him."</p>

<p>"He's everywhere. Everybody's heard of him. He said he'd know
it if we double-crossed Stanley. After I seen what he done in the
Kaji country, I wouldn't put nothin' past him&mdash;he's
omnivorous."</p>

<p>"Whatever that means."</p>

<p>"You're ignorant."</p>

<p>"Well, just the same, I think we'd ourghter find out who made
that fire. If they're one thing, we'd better light out of here;
if they're the other, we can ask 'em to set us on the right
trail."</p>

<p>"Maybe you said something intelligent at last. It wouldn't do
no harm to go have a look-see."</p>

<p>"That fire may be a long ways off, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what?"</p>

<p>"This is lion country."</p>

<p>"You scared?"</p>

<p>"Sure I'm scared. So are you, unless you're a bigger fool than
I think. Nobody but a fool wouldn't be scared in lion country at
night without a gun."</p>

<p>"We'll take a couple of the smokes with us. They say lions
like dark meat."</p>

<p>"All right; let's get goin'."</p>

<p>Guided by the fire, the four men approached the Wood-van
Eyk camp, and after reconnoitering made their way to the
concealment of a clump of bushes where they could see and not be
seen.</p>

<p>"Cripes!" whispered Spike. "Look who's there!"</p>

<p>"Gonfala!" breathed Troll.</p>

<p>"An' Wood an' van Eyk."</p>

<p>"T'ell with them! If we only had the girl!"</p>

<p>"Wot do we want of her?"</p>

<p>"You get less brains every minute. Wot do we want of 'er! If
we had her we could make the diamond do its stuff just like Mafka
did&mdash;just like Clayton did. We'd be safe; nothin' nor nobody
couldn't hurt us."</p>

<p>"Well, we ain't got her."</p>

<p>"Shut up! Listen to wot they're sayin'."</p>

<p>The voices of the three whites by the campfire came clearly to
Troll and Spike. Van Eyk was making plans for the morrow's
hunt.</p>

<p>"I really think Gonfala ought to stay in camp and rest; but as
long as she insists on coming along, you and she can go together.
If there were three men, now, we could spread out farther and
cover more ground."</p>

<p>"I can do whatever a man can do," insisted Gonfala. "You can
assume that you have three men."</p>

<p>"But, Gonfala&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, Stanlee. I am not as the women you have
known in your civilized countries. From what you have told me, I
shall be as helpless and afraid there as they would be here; but
here I am not afraid. So I hunt tomorrow as the third man, and
now I am going to bed. Good night, Stanlee. Good night, Bob."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that settles it," remarked Wood, with a wry
smile; "but when I get you back in God's country you'll have to
mind me. Good night."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Gonfala.</p>

<p><br>
THE chill of night still hung like a vapor below the new sun
as the three hunters set out from their camp for the day's sport,
and although the hunt had been van Eyk's idea primarily, each of
the others was keen to bag a lion. Over their breakfast coffee
they had laid wagers as to which would be the lucky one to bring
down the first trophy, with the result that not a little friendly
rivalry had been engendered. That each might, seemed entirely
possible; as the night had been filled with the continual roaring
of the great carnivores.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving camp the three separated, van Eyk
keeping straight ahead toward the east, Wood diverging toward the
south, and Gonfala to the north; each was accompanied by a
gunbearer; and some of the members of the safari followed along
after van Eyk and Wood, either believing that one of the men
would be more likely to get a lion than would the girl, or,
perhaps, feeling safer behind the guns of the men.</p>

<p>From behind an outcropping of rock at the summit of a low hill
northwest of the Wood-van Eyk camp Spike and Troll watched
their departure; while below them, concealed from sight, the six
men of their safari waited. The two whites watched Gonfala and
her gunbearer approaching across the open plain. The direction
that she was taking suggested that she would pass a little to the
east of them, but that she would then still be in sight of van
Eyk and possibly Wood also.</p>

<p>The latter was not at all happy about the arrangements for the
day; he did not like the idea of Gonfala going out on her own
after lion with only a gunbearer, but the girl had overridden his
every objection. He had insisted, however, upon sending as
gunbearer a man of known courage who was also a good shot; and
him he had instructed to be always ready with the second rifle in
the event that Gonfala got into a tight place and, regardless of
custom, to shoot a charging lion himself.</p>

<p>While Gonfala had had little previous experience of firearms
prior to a few weeks ago, it gave him some consolation to reflect
that she had, even in that short time, developed into an
excellent shot; and insofar as her nerve was concerned he had no
cause for anxiety. What he could not have known, of course, was
the far greater menace of the two men who watched her from their
rocky concealment upon the hill-top.</p>

<p>Gonfala passed the hill beneath the eyes of Spike and Troll
and then crossed a low rise that was a continuation of the hill
running down into the plain, and from then on she was hidden from
the sight of either van Eyk or Wood. The country she now entered
was broken by gullies and outcroppings of rock, by low bushes and
occasional trees; so that it was comparatively easy for Spike and
Troll to follow her without danger of being discovered; and this
they did, keeping well to the rear of her and catching only an
occasional glimpse of her during the ensuing hour.</p>

<p>Quite unsuspecting the fact that eight men followed upon her
trail, Gonfala continued her seemingly fruitless search for lion,
bearing constantly a little to the west because of a range of low
hills that lay to the right of her and thus constantly increasing
the distance between herself and her two companions. She had
about come to the conclusion that the lions had all left the
country when she heard, faint and far toward the east, the report
of two rifle shots.</p>

<p>"Some one else had the luck," she said to her gunbearer; "I
guess we came in the wrong direction."</p>

<p>"No, Memsahib," he whispered, pointing; "look! Simba!"</p>

<p>She looked quickly in the direction he indicated; and there
among the grasses beneath a tree she saw the head of a lion, the
yellow-green eyes gazing unblinkingly at her. The beast was about
a hundred yards distant; he was lying down, and as only his head
was visible he offered a poor target. A frontal shot, she knew,
would only tend to infuriate him and precipitate a charge.</p>

<p>"Pay no attention to him," she whispered; "we'll try to get
closer and to one side."</p>

<p>She moved forward then, not directly toward the lion but as
though to pass a little to the right of him; and always his eyes
followed them, but neither she nor the gunbearer gave any
indication that they were aware of his presence. When she had
approached to within about fifty yards she stopped and faced him,
but he only lay quietly regarding her. But when she took a few
steps straight toward him, he bared his great fangs and
growled.</p>

<p>Topping a rise behind her, Spike took in the situation at a
glance. He motioned to his men to halt, and beckoned Troll to his
side. Together they watched the tense scene below them.</p>

<p>"I wish he'd get up," said Gonfala.</p>

<p>The gunbearer picked up a stone and hurled it at the lion. The
result was immediate and electrical. With an angry roar the lion
leaped to its feet and charged.</p>

<p>"Shoot, Memsahib!"</p>

<p>Gonfala dropped to one knee and fired. The lion leaped high
into the air, its angry roars shattering the silence. It was hit,
but it was not stopped; for although it rolled over on its back
it was up again in an instant and bearing down on them at
terrific speed. Gonfala fired again and missed. Then the
gunbearer took aim and pressed the trigger of his gun. There was
only a futile click. The cartridge misfired. The lion was almost
upon Gonfala when the gunbearer, unnerved by the failure of his
gun, turned and fled. Unwittingly he had saved Gonfala's life,
for at sight of the man in flight the lion, already rising over
Gonfala, followed a natural instinct that has saved the life of
many a hunter and pursued the fleeing man. Gonfala fired again,
and again scored a hit; but it did not stop the infuriated beast
as it rose upon its hind feet and seized the gunbearer, the great
fangs closing upon his head until they met in the center of his
brain.</p>

<p>The girl was aghast as she stood helplessly by while the huge
cat mauled its victim for a moment; then it sagged upon the body
of the man and died.</p>

<p>"That," said Troll, "is wot I call a bit o' luck. We not only
gets the girl, but we gets two guns."</p>

<p>"And no witness," added Spike. "Come on!" He motioned the
others to follow him, and started down the declivity toward
Gonfala.</p>

<p>She saw them almost immediately and for a moment thought her
companions were coming, but presently she recognized them. She
knew that they were bad men who had stolen the great diamond and
the emerald, but she had no reason to believe that she was in any
danger from them.</p>

<p>They came up to her smiling and friendly. "You sure had a
narrow squeak," said Spike. "We seen it from the top of that
rise, but we couldn't have done nothing to help you even if we'd
had guns&mdash;we was too far away."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We was tryin' to find our way to railhead," explained Spike.
"We been lost fer weeks."</p>

<p>Troll was recovering the gun and ammunition from the dead
gunbearer, and Spike was eyeing the splendid rifle that Gonfala
carried.</p>

<p>"We're on our way to railhead," she explained. "You can come
back to camp with me and go on to railhead with us."</p>

<p>"Won't that be nice!" exclaimed Spike. "Say, that's a fine gun
you got there. Lemme see it a minute." Thoughtlessly, she handed
the weapon over to him; then she stepped over to the body of the
dead gunbearer.</p>

<p>"He's quite dead," she said. "It's too bad. Your men can carry
him back to camp."</p>

<p>"We ain't goin' back to your camp," said Spike.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed. "Well, what am I to do? I can't take him
back alone."</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' back neither."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just wot I says: You ain't goin' back to your camp. You're
comin' with us."</p>

<p>"Oh, no I'm not."</p>

<p>"Listen, Gonfala," said Spike. "We don't want no trouble with
you. We don't want to hurt you none; so you might as well come
along peaceful like. We need you."</p>

<p>"What for?" Her voice was brave, but her heart sank within
her.</p>

<p>"We got the Gonfal, but we can't make it work without
you."</p>

<p>"Work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, work. We're goin' to set ourselves up like Mafka did and
be kings&mdash;just as soon as we find a piece o' country we
like. We'll live like kings, too, off the fat of the land. You
can be queen&mdash;have everything you want. Maybe, even, I'll
marry you." He grinned.</p>

<p>"The hell you will," snapped Troll. "She belongs to me as much
as she does to you."</p>

<p>Gonfala cringed. "I belong to neither of you. You are both
fools. If you take me away, you will be followed and killed; or,
at the least, both I and the Gonfal will be taken from you. If
you have any sense you will let me go; then you can take the
Gonfal to Europe. They tell me that there the money that it would
bring would buy you anything that you wanted all the rest of your
lives."</p>

<p>"A fat chance we'd have gettin' rid o' that rock in Europe,"
said Troll. "No, sister, we got it all figgered out. You're
comin' with us, an' that's that."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; CLUES</a></h2>

<p class="first">VAN EYK dropped his lion with the second shot,
and a few minutes later he heard the three shots fired by
Gonfala. Wood, having had no luck and attracted by the report of
van Eyk's gun, joined him. He was still apprehensive concerning
Gonfala's safety; and now that van Eyk had his trophy, he
suggested that they send the carcass back to camp while they
joined Gonfala. Van Eyk agreed, and they set out in the direction
from which they had heard the shots.</p>

<p>They searched for two hours without result, often calling her
name and occasionally discharging their rifles; then, more by
chance than design, they stumbled upon the little swale where
Gonfala had come upon her lion. There it lay upon the body of the
dead gunbearer, but Gonfala was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The ground was hard and stony, giving no indication to the
untrained eyes of the white men that others beside Gonfala and
her gunbearer had been there; so they assumed that, having no one
to cut off or carry the head of the lion back to camp, the girl
had returned there herself alone; and that, having come from
another direction, they had missed her. They were, therefore, not
unduly apprehensive until after they reached the camp and
discovered that she had not returned.</p>

<p>By that time it was late in the afternoon; but Wood insisted
upon taking up the search at once, and van Eyk seconded the
suggestion. They divided the safari into three sections. Van Eyk
and Wood each heading one set out on slightly diverging trails in
the general direction that Gonfala had taken in the morning,
while the third, under a headman, was ordered to remain in camp,
keeping a large fire burning and occasionally discharging a rifle
to guide Gonfala if she should return toward camp without meeting
either Wood or van Eyk. And all during the night Gonfala and her
captors heard the faint report of rifles far to the south.</p>

<p>It was around noon of the following day that, exhausted and
disheartened, Wood and van Eyk returned to camp.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's no use, old man," said the latter,
sympathetically; "if she'd been alive she'd have heard our rifles
and replied."</p>

<p>"I can't believe that she's dead," said Wood; "I won't believe
it!"</p>

<p>Van Eyk shook his head. "I know it's tough, but you've got to
face facts and reason. She couldn't be alive in this lion country
now."</p>

<p>"But she had two guns," insisted Wood. "You saw that she took
the gun and ammunition from the gunbearer after he was killed. If
she'd been attacked by a lion, she'd have fired at least once;
and we never heard a shot."</p>

<p>"She might have been taken unaware&mdash;stalked after dark
and struck down before she knew a lion was near. You've seen 'em
charge; you know it's all over in a second if you aren't ready
for 'em."</p>

<p>Wood nodded. "Yes, I know. I suppose you're right, but I won't
give up&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>"Well, Stan, I've got to get back home. If I thought there was
the slightest chance I'd stay, but I know there's not. You'd
better come along and try to forget it as soon as you can. You
might never, here; but back home it'll be different."</p>

<p>"There's no use, Van; you go along. I'm going to stay."</p>

<p>"But what can you do alone?"</p>

<p>"I won't try to do anything alone. I'm going back and find
Tarzan; he'll help me. If any one can find her or where she was
killed it's he."</p>

<p><br>
TEN days later Wood plodded wearily into the camp that he had
not left except in daily fruitless searches for his Gonfala. He
had not gone back to enlist Tarzan's aid; but had, instead, sent
a long letter to the ape-man by a runner. Every day for ten days
he had combed the country for miles around, and each day he had
become more convinced that Gonfala was not dead. He had found no
trace of a human kill by lions, no shred of clothing, no sign of
the two guns or the ammunition that Gonfala had had with her;
though he had found plenty of lion kills&mdash;zebra, antelope,
wildebeest. But he had found something else that gave support to
his belief that Gonfala might be alive&mdash;the camp of Spike
and Troll. It lay only a short distance north from his own camp.
Gonfala must have pressed close to it the morning that she
started out to hunt. What type of men had camped there, he could
not know; but he assumed that they were natives; for there were
no signs of white men&mdash;no empty tins, no discarded scrap of
clothing, no indications that a tent had been pitched.</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, Gonfala's fate had been worse than the merciful
death the king of beasts would have accorded her. That thought
goaded him to desperation, and filled his mind with red
imaginings of vengeance. Such were his thoughts as he threw
himself upon his cot in hopeless bafflement to reproach himself
as he had a thousand thousand times for having permitted Gonfala
to hunt alone that day&mdash;how long ago it seemed, how many
ages of bitter suffering!</p>

<p>A figure darkened the doorway of the tent, and Wood turned to
look. Wood sprang to his feet. "Tarzan! God, I thought you'd
never come."</p>

<p>"I came as soon as I got your letter. You have been searching,
of course; what have you found?"</p>

<p>Wood told him of his failure to find any evidence that Gonfala
had fallen prey to lions but that he had found a camp in which
there had been men recently.</p>

<p>"That is interesting," commented Tarzan. "It is too late now
to investigate that today; tomorrow I'll have a look at it."</p>

<p>Early the next morning Wood and the ape-man were at the camp
from which Spike and Troll had been attracted by the campfire
that had led them to the discovery of the presence of Gonfala.
Tarzan examined the ground and the surroundings minutely. His
lifetime of experience, his trained powers of observation, his
sensitive nostrils revealed facts that were a sealed book to the
American. The charred wood in the dead fires, the crushed grass,
the refuse each told him something.</p>

<p>"It was a poor camp," he said finally. "Perhaps ten or a dozen
men camped here. They had very little food and their packs were
few. They did have packs, and that indicates that there were
white men&mdash;perhaps one, perhaps two; the rest were natives.
Their food was poor. That would suggest that they had no
firearms, for this is a good game country; so perhaps there were
no white men at all. Yet I am sure there were. They had only the
meat of an old boar to eat. Some of the bones were split and the
marrow extracted. That suggests natives. Other bones were not
split, and that suggests white men."</p>

<p>"How do you know they had packs?" asked Wood, who could see no
evidence to suggest anything more than that some one had been
there and built fires and eaten food. He could see the discarded
bones of their repast.</p>

<p>"If you look carefully you will see where they lay on the
ground. It has been ten days at least; and the signs are faint,
but they are there. The grasses are pressed down and the marks of
the cords that bound the packs are still visible."</p>

<p>"I see nothing," admitted Wood after close scrutiny.</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled one of his rare smiles. "Now we shall see which
way they went," he said. "The spoor of so many men should be
plain."</p>

<p>They followed toward the north the freshest spoor that led
from the camp, only to lose it where a great herd of grazing game
had obliterated it; then Tarzan picked it up again beyond.
Eventually it led to the spot where the bodies of the gunbearer
and the lion had lain.</p>

<p>"Your theory seems to have been correct," said the ape-man.
"Gonfala, apparently, was captured by this party."</p>

<p>"That was eleven days ago," mused Wood despairingly. "There is
no telling where they are now, or what they have done to her. We
must lose no time in following."</p>

<p>"Not we," replied Tarzan. "You will return to your camp and
start tomorrow for my place. When I have definitely located
Gonfala, if I cannot rescue her without help" (Again he smiled)
"I'll send word by a runner, and you can come with an escort of
Waziri."</p>

<p>"But can't I go along with you?" demanded Wood.</p>

<p>"I can travel much faster alone. You will do as I say. That is
all."</p>

<p>And that was all. Wood stood watching the magnificent figure
of the ape-man until it disappeared beyond a rise in the rolling
plain; then he turned dejectedly back toward camp. He knew that
Tarzan was right, that a man whose senses were dulled by
generations of non-use would prove only a drag on the alert
ape-man.</p>

<p><br>
FOR two days Tarzan followed the trail in a northerly
direction; then an unseasonable rain obliterated it forever. He
was now in the country of the Bantangos, a warlike tribe of
cannibals and hereditary enemies of his Waziri. He knew that if
the captors of Gonfala had come this way it might be because they
were themselves Bantangos, and so he determined to investigate
thoroughly before searching farther. If they had not been
Bantangos, it was very possible that they had been captured by
this tribe; for he knew that they were a small and poorly
equipped company.</p>

<p>In any event it seemed best to have a look into the village of
the chief, to which, unquestionably, important captives would
have been taken; but where the village lay, the ape-man did not
know. To the east of him a range of low hills stretched way into
the north, and to these he made his way. As he ascended them he
commenced to glimpse villages to the west and north, and finally
from the summit of one of the higher hills he obtained a view of
a considerable extent of country containing many villages. The
majority of these were mean and small&mdash;just a handful of
huts surrounded by flimsy palisades of poles.</p>

<p>The valley in which the villages lay was dotted with trees,
and on the west abutted upon a forest. It was a scene of peace
and loveliness that lent a certain picturesqueness to even the
squalid kraals of the Bantangos and belied the savagery and
bestiality of the inhabitants. The beauty of the aspect was not
lost upon the ape-man, whose appreciation of the loveliness or
grandeur of nature, undulled by familiarity, was one of the chief
sources of his joy of living. In contemplating the death that he
knew must come to him as to all living things his keenest regret
lay in the fact that he would never again be able to look upon
the hills and valleys and forests of his beloved Africa; and so
today, as he lay like a great lion low upon the summit of a hill,
stalking his prey, he was still sensible of the natural beauties
that lay spread before him. Nor was he unmindful of a large
village that lay toward the center of the valley, the largest, by
far, of any of the villages. This, he knew, must be the village
of the chief of the Bantangos.</p>

<p>The moonless night descended, a black shroud that enveloped
the forest, the trees, and the villages, concealing them from the
eyes of the watcher; then the Lord of the Jungle arose,
stretching himself. So like a lion's were all his movements that
one might have expected the roar of the hunting beast to rumble
from his great chest. Silently he moved down toward the village
of the chief. Little lights shone now about the valley, marking
the various villages by their cooking fires. Toward the fires of
the largest strode an English lord, naked but for a G-string.</p>

<p>From the hills he was quitting a lion roared. He too was
coming down to the villages where the natives had gathered their
little flocks within the flimsy enclosures of their kraals. The
ape-man stopped and raised his face toward the heavens. From his
deep chest rose the savage, answering challenge of the bull-ape.
The savages in the villages fell silent, looking questioningly at
one another, wide eyed in terror. The warriors seized their
weapons, the women huddled their children closer.</p>

<p>"A demon," whispered one.</p>

<p>"Once before I heard that cry," said the chief of the
Bantangos. "It is the cry of the devil-god of the Waziri."</p>

<p>"Why would he come here?" demanded a warrior. "The rains have
come many times since we raided in the country of the
Waziri."</p>

<p>"If it is not he," said the chief, "then it is another devil-
god."</p>

<p>"When I was a boy," said an old man, "I went once with a
raiding party far toward the place where the sun sleeps, to a
great forest where the hairy tree-men live. They make a loud cry
like that, a cry that stops the heart and turns the skin cold.
Perhaps it is one of the hairy tree-men. We were gone a long
time. The rains were just over when we left our village; they
came again before we returned. I was a great warrior. I killed
many warriors on that raid. I ate their hearts; that is what
makes me so brave." No one paid any attention to him, but he
rambled on. The others were listening intently for a repetition
of the weird cry or for any sound that might presage the approach
of an enemy.</p>

<p><br>
TARZAN approached the palisade that surrounded the village of
the chief. A tree within the enclosure spread its branches across
the top. The ape-man came close and investigated. Through the
interstices between the poles that formed the palisade he watched
the natives. Gradually their tense nerves relaxed as there was no
repetition of the cry that had alarmed them; and they returned to
their normal pursuits, the women to their cooking, the men to the
immemorial custom of the lords of creation&mdash;to doing
nothing.</p>

<p>Tarzan wished to scale the palisade and gain the branches of
the tree that spread above him; but he wished to do it without
attracting the attention of the Bantangos, and because of the
frail construction of the palisade, he knew that that would be
impossible during the quiet that prevailed within the village at
the supper hour. He must wait. Perhaps the opportunity he sought
would present itself later. With the patience of the wild beast
that stalks its prey, the ape-man waited. He could, if necessary,
wait an hour, a day, a week. Time meant as little to him as it
had to the apes that raised him, his contacts with civilization
not having as yet enslaved him to the fetish of time.</p>

<p>Nothing that he could see within the restricted limits of his
vision, a section of the village visible between two huts just
within the palisade, indicated that the Bantangos held white
prisoners; but he knew that if such were the case they might be
confined within a hut; and it was this, among other things, that
he must know before continuing his search elsewhere.</p>

<p>The evening meal concluded, the blacks lapsed into somnolence.
The quiet of the African night was broken only by the occasional
roars of the hunting lion, coming closer and closer, a sound so
familiar that it aroused the interest of neither the blacks
within the village nor the watcher without.</p>

<p>An hour passed. The lion ceased his roaring, evidence that he
was now approaching his prey and stalking. The blacks stirred
with awakening interest with the passing of the phenomenon of
digestion and became motivated by the same primitive urge that
fills El Morocco and other late spots with dancers after the
theater. A dusky maestro gathered his players with their
primitive instruments, and the dancing began. It was the moment
for which Tarzan had been awaiting. Amidst the din of the drums
and the shouts of the dancers he swarmed to the top of the
palisade and swung into the tree above.</p>

<p>From a convenient limb he surveyed the scene below. He could
see the chief's hut now and the chief himself. The old fellow sat
upon a stool watching the dancers, but in neither the chief nor
the dancers did the ape-man discover a focus for his
interest&mdash;that was riveted upon something that lay at the
chief's feet&mdash;the Great Emerald of the Zuli.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake. There could be but one such stone,
and its presence here induced a train of deductive reasoning in
the alert mind of the ape-man that led to definite
conclusions&mdash;that Spike and Troll had been in the vicinity
and that it was logical to assume that it must have been they who
abducted Gonfala. Were they here now, in this village of the
Bantangos? Tarzan doubted it; there was nothing to indicate that
there were any prisoners in the village, but he must know
definitely; so he waited on with the infinite patience that was
one of the heritages of his upbringing.</p>

<p>The night wore on; and at last the dancers tired, and the
village street was deserted. Sounds of slumber arose from the
dark huts, unlovely sounds, fitting bed-fellows of unlovely
odors. Here and there a child fretted or an infant wailed. Beyond
the palisade a lion coughed.</p>

<p>The ape-man dropped silently into the empty street. Like a
shadow he passed from hut to hut, his keen nostrils searching out
the scents that would tell him, as surely as might his eyes could
he have seen within, whether a white lay prisoner there. No one
heard him; not even a sleeping cur was disturbed. When he had
made the rounds he knew that those he sought were not there, but
he must know more. He returned to the chief's hut. On the ground
before it, like worthless trash, lay the Great Emerald of the
Zuli. Its weird green light cast a soft radiance over the bronzed
body of the jungle lord, tinged the chief's hut palely green,
accentuated the blackness of the low entrance way.</p>

<p>The ape-man paused a moment, listening; then he stooped and
entered the hut. He listened to the breathing of the inmates. By
their breathing he located the women and the children and the one
man&mdash;that one would be the chief. To his side he stepped and
kneeled, stooping low. Steel thewed fingers closed lightly upon
the throat of the sleeper. The touch awakened him.</p>

<p>"Make no sound," whispered the ape-man, "if you would
live."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded the chief in a whisper. "What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I am the devil-god," replied Tarzan. "Where are the two white
men and the white woman?"</p>

<p>"I have seen no white woman," replied the chief.</p>

<p>"Do not speak lies&mdash;I have seen the green stone."</p>

<p>"The two white men left it behind them when they ran away,"
insisted the chief, "but there was no white woman with them. The
sun has risen from his bed as many times as I have fingers on my
two hands and toes on one foot since the white men were
here."</p>

<p>"Why did they run away?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"We were at their camp. A lion came and attacked us; the white
men ran away, leaving the green stone behind."</p>

<p>A woman awoke and sat up. "Who speaks?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Tell her to be quiet," cautioned Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Shut up," snapped the chief at the woman, "if you do not wish
to die&mdash;it is the devil-god!"</p>

<p>The woman stifled a scream and lay down, burying her face in
the dirty reeds that formed her bed.</p>

<p>"Which way did the white men go?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"They came from the north. When they ran away they went into
the forest to the west. We did not follow them. The lion had
killed two of my warriors and mauled others."</p>

<p>"Were there many in the safari of the white men?"</p>

<p>"Only six, beside themselves. It was a poor safari. They had
little food and no guns. They were very poor." His tone was
contemptuous. "I have told you all I know. I did not harm the
white men or their men. Now go away. I know no more."</p>

<p>"You stole the green stone from them," accused Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No. They were frightened and ran away, forgetting it; but
they took the white stone with them."</p>

<p>"The white stone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the white stone. One of them held it in his hands and
told us to put down our weapons and go away. He said it was big
medicine and that it would kill us if we did not go away; but we
stayed, and it did not kill us."</p>

<p>In the darkness the ape-man smiled. "Has a white woman passed
through your country lately? If you lie to me I shall come back
and kill you."</p>

<p>"I have never seen a white woman," replied the chief. "If one
had passed through my country I should know it."</p>

<p>Tarzan slipped from the hut as silently as he had come. As he
went, he gathered up the Great Emerald and swung into the tree
that overhung the palisade. The chief breathed a choking sigh of
relief and broke into a cold sweat.</p>

<p>Strong in the nostrils of the ape-man was the scent of Numa
the lion. He knew that the great cat was stalking close to the
palisade. He had no quarrel with Numa this night and no wish to
tempt a hungry hunting lion; so he made himself comfortable in
the tree above the cannibal village to wait until Numa had taken
himself elsewhere.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; TANTOR</a></h2>

<p class="first">WEARY day after weary day Gonfala had trudged
north with Spike and Troll. They had made a wide detour to avoid
the country of the Bantangos, for although they had both the
Gonfal and Gonfala they lacked the courage of their convictions
relative to this combination that previously had seemed all-
powerful to them.</p>

<p>Gonfala's safety, so far, had lain in the men's jealousy of
one another. Neither would leave her alone with the other.
Because of her, they had ceased to speak except when absolutely
necessary; and each was constantly afraid that the other would
murder him. To assure her own safety, the girl watched over the
safety of each of the others as though she loved them both.</p>

<p>One of the blacks carried the great diamond, nor did either of
the white men attempt to touch it without arousing the savage
objections of the other; for now that Gonfala was with them each
feared that the other might use the magical power of the stone to
destroy him.</p>

<p>Spike was in search of a district which he had passed through
on safari several years before.</p>

<p>"It's a regular garden, Miss," he explained to Gonfala; "and
game! S'elp me, it's lousy with game; and that gentle, from not
bein' hunted none, that you can walk right up to 'em an' bat 'em
over the head, if you'd a mind to. We could live like kings and
with plenty of servants, too; for the natives is peaceablelike,
and not many of 'em. I mean not too many. We could rule 'em easy
what with our havin' the Gonfal and you."</p>

<p>"I don't know that the Gonfal would do you much good," said
the girl.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Troll.</p>

<p>"You don't know how to use it. One must have certain mental
powers to succeed with the Gonfal."</p>

<p>"Have you got 'em?" asked Spike.</p>

<p>"I could use it unless Mafka desired to prevent me. He could
do that, for his mind could control mine. I have never tried to
use these powers since Mafka died."</p>

<p>"But you think you can?" Spike's voice reflected the fear that
was in him. He had banked heavily on the power of the Gonfal. All
his future plans were dependent upon his being able to control
the acts of others through the mysterious powers of the great
diamond, and now there was doubt. It haunted him day and
night.</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Gonfala, "but I shall not use it to help
either of you unless I am absolutely assured that neither one of
you will harm me."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't think of hurtin' you, Miss," Spike assured
her.</p>

<p>"Me neither, but you better not trust him," said Troll.</p>

<p>Spike took a step toward Troll, his fist clenched. "You dirty
crook," he shouted, "you're the one needs watchin', but you won't
need it much longer. I'm goin' to break your neck for you right
now."</p>

<p>Troll jumped back and picked up his rifle. "Come any closer
and I'll let you have it," he threatened, holding the muzzle of
the weapon aimed at Spike's belly.</p>

<p>"You'd better not," Spike admonished him. "You may need
another gun in some of the country we got to go through. You'd
never get through alone with just six niggers."</p>

<p>"That goes for you, too," growled Troll.</p>

<p>"Then let's call it quits, and quit our rowin'&mdash;it ain't
gettin' us nothin'."</p>

<p>"It won't ever get either one of you me," said Gonfala, "and
that's what's been the trouble between you. You stole me from my
friends, and some day they're going to catch up with you. When
they do, it'll be better for you if you haven't harmed me.
Stanlee Wood will never give up until he finds me; and when he
tells Tarzan I have been stolen, you can rest assured I'll be
found and you will be punished."</p>

<p>"Tarzan!" exclaimed Spike. "What's Tarzan got to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"You know who he is?" demanded Gonfala.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;everybody's heard of him; but I ain't never seen
him. I always thought maybe he was just somethin' somebody made
up. What do you know about him? Have you ever seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and so have you."</p>

<p>"Not us," said Troll.</p>

<p>"You remember Clayton?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Sure, I remember Clayton. That bloke was as good as
two&mdash;Say! You don't mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Clayton is Tarzan."</p>

<p>Troll looked worried. Spike scowled; then he shrugged. "Wot if
he is?" he demanded. "He couldn't never find us&mdash;not where
we're goin'; and even if he did, wot could he do against the
Gonfal? We could do what we pleased with him."</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Troll; "we could snuff him out like that." He
snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>"Oh, no you couldn't," said Gonfala.</p>

<p>"An' why couldn't we?"</p>

<p>"Because I wouldn't let you. You can't use the Gonfal without
my help, and when Tarzan and Stanlee come I shall help them. You
see, with the Gonfal, I can snuff <em>you</em> out."</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another. Presently Spike walked away
and called to Troll to accompany him. When he was out of earshot
of Gonfala be stopped. "Listen," he said; "that dame's got us
to rights. If she ever gets her paws on that rock our lives
won't be worth nothin."</p>

<p>"Looks like the Gonfal ain't goin' to do us much good," said
Troll. "We can't make it work without her; and if we let her get
her hands on it, she'll kill us. Wot are we goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"In the first place we got to see that she doesn't get to
touch it. One of us has got to carry it&mdash;she might get the
nigger to let her touch it some time when we weren't around. You
can carry it if you want to."</p>

<p>"That's wot I been sayin' for a long time," Troll reminded
him.</p>

<p>"Well, it's different now," Spike explained. "Neither one of
us can get it to work, an' neither one of us dares let her touch
it; so we're safe as long as one of us has it."</p>

<p>"But wot good is the stone goin' to do us, then?"</p>

<p>"Wait 'til we get up in that country I been tellin' you about.
We can make the dame be good then. All we got to do is tell her
to work the stone the way we say or we'll croak her. She'll have
to do it, too; for where I'm takin' her she couldn't never find
her way out after she'd killed us; so it wouldn't do her no
good."</p>

<p>Troll shook his head. "Maybe she'd kill us any way, just to
get even with us."</p>

<p>"Well, there ain't nothin' we can do about it now, anyway,"
said Spike; "so let's get goin'. Come on, you niggers! Come on,
Gonfala! we're trekkin'&mdash;the sun's been up an hour."</p>

<p>As they broke camp far to the north of him, Tarzan stopped at
the edge of the forest that bordered the valley of the Bantangos
on the west. He looked about him, carefully taking his bearings;
then with the tip of his spear he loosened the earth in the
center of a triangle formed by three trees and with his hands
scooped out the earth until he had a hole about a foot deep. Into
this he dropped the Great Emerald of the Zuli. When he had
refilled the hole and covered it with the fallen leaves and twigs
that he had carefully scraped away, no human eye could have
detected the hiding place. With his knife he blazed a tree
fifteen paces from one of the three trees that formed the
triangle. Only Tarzan could ever find the place again. Should he
never return, the ransom of a dozen kings would lie there to the
end of time, undiscovered.</p>

<p>Unable to find the trail that the storm had obliterated, the
ape-man attempted to deduce from his knowledge of the two men he
was now positive were the abductors of Gonfala and from his
knowledge of events leading up to the present moment the logical
destination for which they were headed.</p>

<p>He knew that they were familiar with the miraculous powers of
the Gonfal and that they had been unable to call these powers
into being themselves. The chief of the Bantangos had told him of
their failure to demonstrate the value of their big medicine.
Either by accident or intent they had found Gonfala, and what
more natural than that they would assume that with her aid they
could command the wonders of the Gonfal? And where would be the
best place to utilize these powers? Why, the country of the Kaji,
naturally; for there they would be safer from detection than
almost anywhere on earth, and there they would find a tribe
accustomed to the domination of the stone. There they would find
women; and Tarzan felt that if he were any judge of men, that
circumstance would have considerable bearing with Troll and
Spike. So Tarzan travelled toward the north on a trail parallel
to that taken by Spike and Troll but some distance to the west of
it.</p>

<p>For two days Tarzan moved toward the north, and still there
was no sign of those whom he sought. He made his kills and ate
and slept, and swung on tirelessly through forest or across
plains.</p>

<p>As he was passing through a strip of forest along the shoulder
of a range of hills thick with bamboo he heard a sound that
brought him to a halt, listening. It was repeated&mdash;the weak
trumpeting of an elephant in distress. The ape-man turned aside
from the direction he had been travelling and moved cautiously
through the bamboo thicket. He was moving down wind; so he made a
wide circuit in order to pick up the scent spoor of what lay
ahead. There might be something beside an elephant. The caution
of the beast aided and abetted the reasoning powers of the
man.</p>

<p>Presently the scent of Tantor the elephant told him that he
had circled his quarry, and even stronger was the rank odor of
Dango the hyena; then, harsh and raucous, came the hideous
laughing cry of the unclean beast followed by the plaintive help-
cry of the elephant. Tantor was in trouble, and the ape-man
pushed forward to learn the cause.</p>

<p>Almost as old as Tarzan was the friendship of Tarzan and
Tantor. Perhaps he had never seen this elephant before; but
still, to Tarzan, he would be Tantor&mdash;the name and the
friendship belonged to all elephants.</p>

<p>As he came closer, he moved more cautiously&mdash;beastlike,
always scenting a trap. For those of the jungle, eternal
vigilance is the price of life. At last he came close enough so
that by parting the bamboo he could see that for which he had
been searching. The top of Tantor's back was just visible in an
elephant pit. Snapping and growling at the edge of the pit were a
pair of hyenas, circling above was Ska the vulture; and from
these omens the ape-man knew that Tantor was near death.</p>

<p>Parting the bamboo, Tarzan stepped into the little clearing
that the builders of the pit had made, an enlargement of a wide
elephant trail. Instantly the hyenas transferred their attention
from the elephant to the ape-man, and with bared fangs faced him.
But as the man advanced, they retreated snarling. He paid no
attention to them; for he knew that ordinarily Dango would not
attack any but a helpless man.</p>

<p>As he approached the pit Tantor saw him and trumpeted a feeble
warning. The elephant's skin hung loosely on its great frame,
evidencing that it had been long without food or water. It had
fallen into a pit that must have been dug and then abandoned,
either because the tribe that dug it had moved away or because no
elephant having fallen into it, they had ceased to visit it.</p>

<p>Tarzan spoke to Tantor in the strange language that he used
with the beasts of the jungle. Perhaps Tantor did not understand
the words&mdash;who may know?&mdash;but something, the tone
perhaps, carried the idea that the ape-man wished to convey, that
he was a friend; but Tantor needed something beside kind words,
and so Tarzan set about cutting the bamboo that bore the
tenderest shoots and carrying them to the imprisoned beast.</p>

<p>Tantor ate with avidity, the water content of the shoots
furnishing at least some of the moisture that his great frame
required even more than it required food; then Tarzan set to work
with spear and knife and hands upon the seemingly Herculean task
of excavating a ramp up which Tantor could walk to liberty. It
was the work not of an hour but of many hours, and it was not
completed until the following day; then, weak and staggering, the
great pachyderm climbed slowly from the pit. He was a huge beast,
one of the largest old bulls Tarzan had ever seen. One tusk, by
some peculiar freak of nature, was much darker than the other;
and this, with his great size, must have marked him among his
fellows as a bull of distinction.</p>

<p>As he came out of the pit, his sensitive trunk passed over the
body of the ape-man in what was almost a caress; then, as Tarzan
took his way once more toward the north, Tantor turned and moved
slowly along the elephant trail toward the east and the nearest
water.</p>

<p><br>
DAYS passed. Stanley Wood, waiting at Tarzan's estate, grew
more and more frantic as no news came of the whereabouts of
Tarzan. He plead with Muviro, headman of the Waziri, to furnish
him with an escort and let him set out in search of Gonfala; and
at last Muviro yielded to his importunities and sent him away
with half a dozen warriors as an escort.</p>

<p>Wood took up the search at the point at which Tarzan had left
him, where the clean picked bones of the lion Gonfala had killed
lay bleaching in the sun. He knew only that those he sought had
started north at that spot. It was a blind and seemingly hopeless
search; but it meant action; and anything was preferable to
sitting idly, his mind torn by fears and doubts as to the fate of
Gonfala.</p>

<p>As they approached the Bantango country, the Waziri, knowing
the nature and temper of the inhabitants, counseled making a
detour to avoid them; and entirely by chance they selected an
easterly route&mdash;the route that Spike and Troll had chosen
for the same reason. Thus it happened that a week later they
received definite proof that they were on the right trail. At a
village of friendly blacks they were told that a safari of nine
that included two white men and a white girl had stopped
overnight with the tribe. The chief had furnished them with
guides to the next friendly village to the north.</p>

<p>Wood talked to these men and learned that the chief of the
village to which they had guided the safari had also furnished
them guides for the next stage of their journey, and for the
first time in weeks the young American found hope rekindled in
his bosom. He had learned that up to this point Gonfala had been
alive and well; and that, from what the villagers had seen, there
was no indication that she was being ill-treated.</p>

<p>All the marvelous tracking skill of the Lord of the Jungle had
been nullified by a heavy rain, and then chance had set in and
sent him upon the wrong trail and Stanley Wood upon the right
one.</p>

<p>Through such a trivial vagary of fate lives were jeopardized
and men died.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; STRANGERS</a></h2>

<p class="first">SPIKE and Troll were holding palaver with the
chief of a northern tribe. They had come far, guided from village
to village by friendly natives. Luck had been with them, but now
this good fortune seemed to be at an end. They were trying to
persuade the old chief to furnish them with guides to the next
village.</p>

<p>"No more villages," he said. He did not like these white men.
He held them in contempt because their safari was small and poor,
too poor even to rob. They had nothing but two rifles&mdash;and
the girl. He had been thinking about her. He was also thinking of
a black sultan to the east to whom she might be sold, but he put
this thought from him. He did not wish any trouble with the white
men. Native soldiers had come to his village once under white
officers and punished him for ill-treating the safari of some
white hunters. They had come from a great distance just to do
that, and the incident had given him vast respect for the power
and the long arm of the white man.</p>

<p>"What is north?" asked Spike.</p>

<p>"Mountains," replied the chief.</p>

<p>"That," said Spike to Troll, "is like the country where my
valley is. It is surrounded by mountains." He tried to explain to
the chief the valley for which they were searching and the tribe
that inhabited it.</p>

<p>A cunning look came into the eyes of the chief. He wished to
be rid of these men, and he saw how he might do it. "I know the
valley," he said. "Tomorrow I will give you guides."</p>

<p>"I guess maybe we ain't lucky," gloated Spike, as he and Troll
came from their palaver with the chief and sat down beside
Gonfala. The girl did not inquire why; but Spike explained,
nevertheless. "It won't be long now," he said, "before we're safe
and sound in my valley."</p>

<p>"You won't be safe," said Gonfala. "Tarzan and Stanlee Wood
will come soon&mdash;very soon now."</p>

<p>"They won't never find us where we're goin'."</p>

<p>"The natives will guide them from village to village just as
they have guided you," she reminded him. "It will be very easy to
follow you."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Spike, "they can follow us up to where these
people will guide us."</p>

<p>"But there we will stop. They will find you there."</p>

<p>"We don't stop there," said Spike. "I guess I ain't nobody's
fool. The valley these people are takin' us to, ain't my valley;
but once I get in this here first valley, I can find the other. I
passed through it comin' out of my valley. It's about two marches
east of where we want to go. When we get to this first valley, we
won't need no guides the rest of the way; so, when we leave this
here first valley, we'll tell 'em we're goin' to the coast, an'
start off to the east; then we'll swing around back way to the
north of 'em an' go west to my valley. And there won't nobody
never find us."</p>

<p>"Tarzan and Stanlee Wood will find you."</p>

<p>"I wisht you'd shut up about this here Tarzan and Stanlee
Wood. I'm sick of hearin' of 'em. It's gettin' on my nerves."</p>

<p>Troll sat staring at Gonfala through half closed lids. He had
not spoken much all day, but he had looked much at Gonfala.
Always when she caught his glance he turned his eyes away.</p>

<p>They had been able to sustain themselves this far by killing
game and trading the meat to natives for other articles of food,
principally vegetables and corn. Tonight they feasted royally and
went to their beds early. Gonfala occupied a hut by herself; the
two men had another near by. They had had a hard day's trek, and
tired muscles combined with a heavy meal to induce early slumber.
Gonfala and Spike were asleep almost as soon as they had
stretched themselves on their sleeping mats.</p>

<p>Not so Troll. He remained very much awake&mdash;thinking. He
listened to the heavy breathing of Spike that denoted that he
slept soundly. He listened to the sounds in the village.
Gradually they died out&mdash;the village slept. Troll thought
how easy it would be to kill Spike, but he was afraid of Spike.
Even when the man slept, he was afraid of him. That made Troll
hate him all the more, but it was not hate alone that made him
wish to kill him. Troll had been daydreaming&mdash;very pleasant
dreams. Spike stood in the way of their fulfillment, yet he could
not muster the courage to kill the sleeping man&mdash;not yet.
"Later," he thought.</p>

<p>He crawled to the doorway of the hut and looked out. There was
no sign of waking life in the village. The silence was almost
oppressive; it extended out into the black void of night beyond
the village. As Troll rose to his feet outside the hut he
stumbled over a cooking pot; the noise, against the background of
silence, seemed terrific. Cursing under his breath, the man stood
motionless, listening.</p>

<p>Spike, disturbed but not fully awakened, moved in his sleep
and turned over; the first dead slumber of early night was
broken. Thereafter he would be more restless and more easily
awakened. Troll did not hear him move, and after a moment of
listening he tip-toed away. Stealthily he approached the hut in
which Gonfala slept.</p>

<p>The girl, restless and wakeful, lay wide-eyed staring out into
the lesser darkness framed by the doorway of her hut. She heard
footsteps approaching. Would they pass, or were they coming here
for her? Weeks of danger, weeks of suspicion, weeks of being
constantly on guard had wrought upon her until she sensed menace
in the most ordinary occurrences; so now she felt, intuitively,
she believed, that someone was coming to her hut. And for what
purpose, other than evil, should one come thus stealthily by
night?</p>

<p>Raising herself upon her hands, she crouched, waiting. Every
muscle tense, she scarcely breathed. Whatever it was, it was
coming closer, closer. Suddenly a darker blotch loomed in the low
opening that was the doorway. An animal or a man on all fours was
creeping in!</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?" It was a muffled scream of
terror.</p>

<p>"Shut up! It's me. Don't make no noise. I want to talk to
you."</p>

<p>She recognized the voice, but it did not allay her fears. The
man crept closer to her. He was by her side now. She could hear
his labored breathing.</p>

<p>"Go away," she said. "We can talk tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said. "You don't want to go to that there valley
and spend the rest of your life with Spike an' a bunch o'
niggers, do you? When he gets us there, he'll kill me an' have
you all to himself. I knows him&mdash;he's that kind of a rat. Be
good to me an' I'll take you away. Me an' you'll beat it with the
diamond. We'll go to Europe, to Paris."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go anywhere with you. Go away! Get out of
here, before I call Spike."</p>

<p>"One squawk out of you, an' I'll wring your neck. You're goin'
to be good to me whether you want to or not." He reached out in
the darkness and seized her, feeling for her throat.</p>

<p>Before he found it she had time to voice a single scream and
cry out once, "Spike!" Then Troll closed choking fingers upon her
throat and bore her down beneath his weight. She struggled and
fought, striking him in the face, tearing at the fingers at her
throat.</p>

<p>Awakened by the scream, Spike raised upon an elbow. "Troll!"
he called. "Did you hear anything?" There was no response.
"Troll!" He reached out to the mat where Troll should have been.
He was not there. Instantly his suspicions were aroused and,
because of his own evil mind, they centered unquestioningly upon
the truth.</p>

<p>In a dozen strides he was at Gonfala's hut; and as he
scrambled through the doorway, Troll met him with an oath and a
snarl. Clinching, the two men rolled upon the floor, biting,
gouging, striking, kicking; occasionally a lurid oath or a scream
of pain punctuated their heavy breathing. Gonfala crouched at the
back of the hut, terrified for fear that one of them would kill
the other, removing the only factor of safety she possessed.</p>

<p>They rolled closer to her; and she edged to one side, out of
their way. Her new position was nearer the doorway. It suggested
the possibility of temporary escape, of which she was quick to
take advantage. In the open, she commenced to worry again for
fear that one of the men would be killed.</p>

<p>She saw that some of the natives, aroused by the commotion
within her hut, had come from theirs. She ran to them, begging
them to stop the fight. The chief was there, and he was very
angry because he had been disturbed. He ordered several warriors
to go and separate the men. They hesitated, but finally
approached the hut. As they did so, the sounds of conflict ended;
and a moment later Spike crawled into the open and staggered to
his feet.</p>

<p>Gonfala feared that the worst had happened. Of the two men,
she had feared Spike the more; for while both were equally brutal
and devoid of decency, Troll was not as courageous as his fellow.
Him she might have circumvented through his cowardice. At least,
that she had thought until tonight; now she was not so sure. But
she was sure that Spike was always the more dangerous. Her one
thought now was to escape him, if only temporarily. Inflamed by
his fight, secure in the knowledge that Troll was dead, what
might he not do? To a far corner of the village she ran and hid
herself between a hut and the palisade. Each moment she expected
to hear Spike hunting for her, but he did not come. He did not
even know that she had left her hut where he thought he had left
her with the dead Troll, and he had gone to his own hut to nurse
his wounds.</p>

<p><br>
BUT Troll was not dead. In the morning Spike found him bloody
and dazed squatting in the village street staring at the ground.
Much to the former's disgust, Troll was not even badly injured.
He looked up as Spike approached.</p>

<p>"Wot happened?" he asked.</p>

<p>Spike looked at him suspiciously for a moment; then his
expression turned to puzzlement. "A bloomin' lorry ran over you,"
he said.</p>

<p>"'A bloomin' lorry,'" Troll repeated. "I never even seen
it."</p>

<p>Gonfala, looking around a corner of the hut behind which she
had been hiding, saw the two men and breathed a sigh of relief.
Troll was not dead; she was not to be left alone with Spike. She
came toward them. Troll glanced up at her.</p>

<p>"'Ose the dame?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gonfala and Spike looked at one another, and the latter tapped
his forehead. "A bit balmy," he explained.</p>

<p>"She don't look balmy," said Troll. "She looks like my
sister&mdash;my sister&mdash;sister." He continued to stare at
her, dully.</p>

<p>"We better get some grub an' be on our way," interrupted
Spike. He seemed nervous and ill at ease in the presence of
Troll. It is one thing to kill a man, quite another to have done
this thing to him.</p>

<p>It was a silent, preoccupied trio that moved off behind two
guides in a northeasterly direction after the morning meal had
been eaten. Spike walked ahead, Troll kept close to Gonfala. He
was often looking at her, a puzzled expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Wot's your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gonfala had a sudden inspiration. Perhaps it was madness to
hope that it might succeed, but her straits were desperate.
"Don't tell me you don't remember your sister's name," she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Troll stared at her, his face expressionless. "Wot <i>is</i> your name?" he asked. "Everything is sort o' blurrylike in my
memory."</p>

<p>"Gonfala," she said. "You remember, don't you&mdash;your
sister?"</p>

<p>"Gonfala; oh, yes&mdash;my sister."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're here," she said; "for now you won't let
anyone harm me, will you?"</p>

<p>"Harm you? They better not try it," he exclaimed
belligerently.</p>

<p>The safari had halted, and they caught up with Spike who was
talking with the two guides.</p>

<p>"The beggars won't go no farther," he explained. "We ain't
made more'n five miles an' they quits us, quits us cold."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Gonfala.</p>

<p>"They say the country ahead is taboo. They say they's white
men up ahead that'll catch 'em an' make slaves out of 'em an'
feed 'em to lions. They've went an' put the fear o' God into our
boys, too."</p>

<p>"Let's turn back," suggested the girl. "What's the use anyway,
Spike? If you get killed the Gonfal won't do you any good. If you
turn around and take me back safely to my friends, I'll do my
best to get them to give you the Gonfal and let you go. I give
you my word that I will, and I know that Stanlee Wood will do
anything that I ask."</p>

<p>Spike shook his head. "Nothin' doin'! I'm goin' where I'm
goin', an' you're goin' with me." He bent close and stared boldly
into her eyes. "If I had to give up one or t'other, I'd give up
the Gonfal before I would you&mdash;but I'm not 'goin' to give up
neither."</p>

<p>The girl shrugged. "I've given you your chance," she said.
"You are a fool not to take it."</p>

<p>So they pushed on without guides farther and farther into the
uncharted wilderness; and each new day Spike was confident that
this day he would stumble upon the enchanted valley of his
dreams, and each night he prophesied for the morrow.</p>

<p>Troll's mental condition remained unchanged. He thought that
Gonfala was his sister, and he showed her what little
consideration there was in his gross philosophy of life to accord
any one. The protective instinct of the brutal male was
stimulated in her behalf; and for this she was grateful, not to
Troll but to fate. Where he had been, where he was going he
appeared not to know or to care. He trudged on day after day in
dumb silence, asking no question, showing no interest in anything
or anyone other than Gonfala. He was obsessed by a belief that
she was in danger, and so he constantly carried one of the rifles
the better to protect her.</p>

<p>For many days they had been in mountainous country searching
for the elusive valley, and at the end of a hard trek they made
camp on the shoulder of a mountain beside a little spring of
clear water. As night fell the western sky was tinged with the
golden red of a dying sunset. Long after the natural phenomenon
should have faded into the blackness of the night the red glow
persisted.</p>

<p>Gonfala sat gazing at it, dreamily fascinated. Spike watched
it, too, with growing excitement. The blacks watched it with
fear. Troll sat crosslegged, staring at the ground.</p>

<p>Spike sat down beside Gonfala. "You know wot that is, girlie?"
he asked. "You know it ain't no sunset, don't you?"</p>

<p>"It looks like a fire&mdash;a forest fire," she said.</p>

<p>"It's a fire all right. I ain't never been there, but I've
seen that light before. I figure it's from the inside of one of
them volcanoes, but I'll tell you wot it means to us&mdash;it
means we found our valley. When I was in that valley I seen that
light to the south at night. All we got to do now is trek along a
little west o' north, an' in maybe four or five marches we orter
be there; then, girlie, you an' me's goin' to settle down to
housekeepin'."</p>

<p>The girl made no reply. She was no longer afraid; for she knew
that Troll would kill Spike if she asked him to; and now she had
no reason to fear being alone with Troll, other than the waning
possibility that he might regain his memory.</p>

<p>The new day found Spike almost jovial, so jubilant was he at
the prospect of soon finding his valley; but his joviality
disappeared when he discovered that two of his six men had
deserted during the night. He was in a cold sweat until he found
that they had not taken the Gonfal with them. After that, he
determined, he would sleep with the great stone at his side,
taking no more chances. He could do this now without arousing the
suspicions of Troll, for Troll had no suspicions. He paid no
attention to the Gonfal nor ever mentioned it.</p>

<p>Toward noon a great valley opened before them, the length of
which ran in the direction Spike wished to travel; and so they
dropped down into it to easy travelling after their long days in
the mountains.</p>

<p>The valley was partially forested, the trees growing more
profusely along the course of a river that wound down from the
upper end of the valley, crossed it diagonally, and disappeared
in a cleft in the hills to the west; but considerable areas were
open and covered with lush grasses, while on the east side of the
valley was a veritable forest of bamboo.</p>

<p>Spike, not knowing if the valley were inhabited; nor, if it
were, the nature or temper of its inhabitants, chose to follow
the wooded strip that bordered the river, taking advantage of the
cover it afforded. Along the river he found a wide elephant
trail, and here they were making excellent speed when one of the
blacks stopped suddenly, listened intently, and pointed
ahead.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Spike.</p>

<p>"Men, Bwana&mdash;coming," replied the black.</p>

<p>"I don't hear nothin'," said Spike. "Do you?" he turned to
Gonfala.</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, I hear voices."</p>

<p>"Then we better get off the trail and hide&mdash;at least
until we see who they are. Here, all of you! Here's a little
trail leadin' off here."</p>

<p>Spike herded the party off to the left of the main trail along
a little winding path through rather heavy underbrush, but they
had covered little more than a hundred yards when they came out
onto the open plain. Here they stopped at the edge of the wood,
waiting and listening. Presently the voices of men came plainly
to their ears, constantly closer and closer, until suddenly it
dawned on them all that the men they heard were approaching along
the little trail through which they had sought to escape.</p>

<p>Spike looked for a place of concealment, but there was none.
The thick underbrush was almost impenetrable behind them, while
on the other hand the plain stretched away across the valley to
the hills upon the west. As a last resort he turned north along
the edge of the wood, urging the others to haste until all were
running.</p>

<p>Glancing back, Gonfala saw the party that had alarmed them
debouching onto the plain. First came a dozen huge Negroes, each
pair of whom held a lion in leash. Following these were six white
men strangely garbed. Even at a distance she could see that their
trappings were gorgeous. Behind them followed a score or more of
other white men. They were similarly dressed but in quieter
raiment. They carried spears as well as swords. One of the
warriors carried something dangling at his side which, even at a
distance, could not have been mistaken for other than it
was&mdash;a bloody human head.</p>

<p>"They're white men," Gonfala called to Spike. "Maybe they'd be
friendly."</p>

<p>"They don't look like it to me," he replied. "I ain't takin'
no chances after wot I been through gettin' you an' the Gonfal
this far."</p>

<p>"Anyone would be better than you," said the girl, and
stopped.</p>

<p>"Come on, you fool!" he cried; and, coming back, seized her
and sought to drag her with him.</p>

<p>"Troll!" she cried. "Help!"</p>

<p>Troll was ahead of them, but now he turned; and, seeing Spike
and the girl scuffling, he ran back. His face was white and
distorted with rage. "Le' go her," he bellowed. "Le' go my
sister!" Then he was upon Spike; and the two went down, striking,
kicking, and biting.</p>

<p>For an instant Gonfala hesitated, undecided. She looked at the
two beasts upon the ground, and then she turned in the direction
of the strange warriors. No one, she reasoned, could be more of a
menace to her than Spike; but she soon saw that the decision had
already been made for her&mdash;the entire party was moving in
their direction. She stood and waited as they approached.</p>

<p>They had covered about half the distance when a warrior in the
lead halted and pointed up the valley. For an instant they
hesitated; then they turned and started off across the valley at
a run, the lions tugging at their leashes and dragging their
keepers after them, the warriors keeping in formation behind
them.</p>

<p>The girl, wondering at their sudden flight, looked up the
valley in the direction in which the warrior had pointed. The
sight that met her eyes filled her with amazement. A herd of
perhaps a hundred elephants carrying warriors on their backs was
moving rapidly down upon them. On the ground at her feet Spike
and Troll still bit and gouged and kicked.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash;
INGRATITUDE</a></h2>

<p class="first">STANLEY WOOD had no difficulty following the
trail of Gonfala's abductors to the point at which their guides
had deserted them, and from there the trained Waziri trackers
carried on until the trail was lost at the edge of a wood where
it had been obliterated by the shuffling pads of a herd of
elephants. Search as they would they could not pick up the trail
again. To Wood, the mystery was complete; he was baffled,
disheartened.</p>

<p>Wearily he pushed on up the valley. If only Tarzan were here!
He, of all men, could find an answer to the riddle.</p>

<p>"Look, Bwana!" cried one of the Waziri. "A city!"</p>

<p>Wood looked ahead, amazed; for there lay a city indeed. No
native village of thatched huts was this, but a walled city of
white, its domes of gold and azure rising above its gleaming
wall.</p>

<p>"What city is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Waziri shook their heads and looked at one another.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Bwana," said one. "I have never been in this
country before."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the memsahib is there," suggested a warrior.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed Wood. "If the people here are unfriendly
they will take us all prisoners," he mused, half aloud; "and then
no one will know where we are, where Gonfala probably is. We must
not all be taken prisoners."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Waranji, "we must not all be taken
prisoners."</p>

<p>"That is a big city," said Wood; "there must be many warriors
there. If they are unfriendly they could easily take us all or
kill us all. Is that not so?"</p>

<p>"We are Waziri," said Waranji, proudly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; and you're great fighters. I know that too; but,
holy mackerel! seven of us can't lick an army, even though six of
us are Waziri."</p>

<p>Waranji shook his head. "We could try," he said. "We are not
afraid."</p>

<p>Wood laid a hand on the ebony shoulder. "You're great guys,
Waranji; and I know you'd walk right plumb into Hell for any
friend of the Big Bwana, but I'm not goin' to sacrifice you. If
those people are friendly, one man will be as safe as seven; if
they're not, seven men won't be any better off than one; so I'm
goin' to send you boys home. Tell Muviro we couldn't find Tarzan.
Tell him we think we've found where the memsahib is. We don't
know for sure, but it seems reasonable. If you meet Tarzan, or
he's back home, he'll know what to do. If you don't see him,
Muviro will have to use his own judgment. Now, go along; and good
luck to you!"</p>

<p>Waranji shook his head. "We cannot leave the bwana alone," he
said. "Let me send one warrior back with a message; the rest of
us will stay with you."</p>

<p>"No, Waranji. You've heard my orders. Go on back."</p>

<p>Reluctantly they left him. He watched them until they passed
out of sight in the wood; then he turned his steps toward the
mysterious city in the distance.</p>

<p><br>
ONCE again Tarzan of the Apes stood upon the edge of the high
plateau at the western rim of the valley of Onthar and looked
down upon Cathne, the city of gold. The white houses, the golden
domes, the splendid Bridge of Gold that spanned the river before
the city's gates gleamed and sparkled in the sunlight. The first
time he had looked upon it the day had been dark and gloomy; and
he had seen the city as a city of enemies; because then his
companion had been Valthor of Athne, the City of Ivory, whose
people were hereditary enemies of the Cathneans. But today,
ablaze in the sunshine, the city offered him only friendship.</p>

<p>Nemone, the queen who would have killed him, was dead.
Alextar, her brother, had been taken from the dungeon in which
she had kept him and been made king by the men who were Tarzan's
fast friends&mdash;Thudos, Phordos, Gemnon, and the others of the
loyal band whom Tarzan knew would welcome him back to Cathne.
Tomos, who had ruled under Nemone as her chief advisor, must have
been either killed or imprisoned. He would be no longer a menace
to the ape-man.</p>

<p>With pleasant anticipation, Tarzan clambered down the steep
gully to the floor of the valley and swung off across the Field
of the Lions toward the city of gold. Field of the Lions! What
memories it conjured! The trip to Xarator, the holy volcano, into
whose fiery pit the kings and queens of Cathne had cast their
enemies since time immemorial; the games in the arena; the wild
lions which roved the valley of Onthar, giving it its other
name&mdash;Field of the Lions. Such were the memories that the
name inspired.</p>

<p>Boldly the ape-man crossed the valley until he stood before
the Bridge of Gold and the two heroic golden lions that flanked
its approach. The guard had been watching his progress across the
valley for some time.</p>

<p>"It is Tarzan," one of them had said while the ape-man was
still half a mile away; and when he stopped before the gates they
all came and welcomed him.</p>

<p>The captain of the guard, a noble whom Tarzan knew well,
escorted him to the palace. "Alextar will be glad to know that
you have returned," he said. "Had it not been for you, he might
not now be king&mdash;or alive. Wait here in this anteroom until
I get word to Alextar."</p>

<p>The room and its furnishings were of a type common in the
palaces of the king and nobles of Cathne. The low ceiling was
supported by a series of engaged columns, carved doors inlaid in
mosaics of gold and ivory gave way to the corridor and an
adjoining apartment, on the stone floor lay some Lion skins and
several heavy woolen rugs of simple design, mural decorations
depicted battle scenes between the lion men of Cathne and the
elephant-men of Athne, and above the murals was a frieze of
mounted heads&mdash;lions, leopards, one huge elephant's head,
and several human heads&mdash;the heads of warriors, beautifully
cured and wearing the ivory head ornaments of nobles of
Athne&mdash;trophies of the chase and of war.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the captain of the guard returned;
and when he did, his face was flushed and troubled and twenty
warriors accompanied him. "I am sorry, Tarzan," he said; "but I
have orders to arrest you."</p>

<p>The ape-man looked at the twenty spears surrounding him and
shrugged. If he were either surprised or hurt, he did not show
it. Once again he was the wild beast trapped by his hereditary
enemy, man; and he would not give man the satisfaction of even
being asked to explain. They took his weapons from him and led
him to a room on the second floor of the palace directly above
the guardroom. It was a better cell than that he had first
occupied in Cathne when he had been incarcerated in a dark hole
with Phobeg, the temple guard who had stepped on god's tail and
thus merited death; for this room was large and well lighted by
two barred windows.</p>

<p>When they had left him and bolted the door, Tarzan walked to
one of the windows and looked down upon one of the palace
courtyards for a moment; then he went to the bench that stood
against one wall and lay down. Seemingly unconscious of danger,
or perhaps contemptuous of it, he slept.</p>

<p>It was dark when he was awakened by the opening of the door of
his cell. A man bearing a lighted torch stood in the doorway. The
ape-man arose as the other entered, closing the door behind
him.</p>

<p>"Tarzan!" he exclaimed; and, crossing the room, he placed a
hand on the other's shoulder&mdash;the Cathnean gesture of
greeting, of friendship, and loyalty.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Gemnon," said the ape-man; "tell me,
are Doria and her father and mother well? and your father,
Phordos?"</p>

<p>"They are well, but none too happy. Things here are bad again,
as you must have conjectured from the treatment accorded
you."</p>

<p>"I knew that something must be wrong," admitted the ape-man;
"but what it was, I didn't know&mdash;and don't."</p>

<p>"You soon shall," said Gemnon. "Ours is indeed an unhappy
country."</p>

<p>"All countries are unhappy where there are men," observed the
ape-man. "Men are the stupidest of beasts. But what has happened
here? I thought that with the death of Nemone all your troubles
were over."</p>

<p>"So did we, but we were wrong. Alextar has proved to be weak,
cowardly, ungrateful. Almost immediately after ascending the
throne he fell under the influence of Tomos and his clique; and
you know what that means. We are all in disfavor. Tomos is
virtually ruler of Cathne, but as yet he has not dared to destroy
us. The warriors and the people hate him, and he knows it. If he
goes too far they will rise, and that will be the end of
Tomos.</p>

<p>"But tell me about yourself. What brings you again to
Cathne?"</p>

<p>"It is a very long story," replied Tarzan. "In the end a young
woman was stolen by two white men. She and the man whom she was
to marry were under my protection. I am searching for her.
Several days ago I came upon two blacks who had been with the
safari of the men who abducted the girl. They described the
country in which the safari had been when they deserted. It lay
to the southeast of Xarator. That is why I am here. I am going
into the country southeast of Xarator in an effort to pick up the
trail."</p>

<p>"I think you will not have to search long," said Gemnon. "I
believe that I know where your young woman is&mdash;not that it
will do you or her much good now that you are a prisoner of
Tomos. As you must know, he has no love for you."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that you know where she is?" asked the
ape-man.</p>

<p>"Alextar sends me often to the valley of Thenar to raid the
Athneans. It is, of course, the work of Tomos, who hopes that I
shall be killed. Very recently I was there. The raid was not very
successful, as we were too few. Tomos always sends too few, and
they are always nobles he fears and would be rid of. We took only
one head. On the way out we saw a small party of people who were
not Athneans. There were four or five slaves, two white men, and
a white woman. The white men were fighting. The woman ran toward
us, which made us think she wished to escape the two men she was
with. We were going to meet her and take the entire party
prisoners when we saw a large body of Athneans coming down the
valley on their war elephants. We were too few to engage them; so
we ran for the Pass of the Warriors and escaped. I naturally
assume that the Athneans captured the young woman and those with
her and that she is now in the City of Ivory; but, as I said
before, the knowledge won't help you much now&mdash;Tomos has
you."</p>

<p>"And what do you think he will do with me? Has he another
Phobeg?"</p>

<p>Gemnon laughed. "I shall never forget how you tossed 'the
strongest man in Cathne' about and finally threw him bodily into
the laps of the audience. Tomos lost his last obol on that
fight&mdash;another good reason why he has no love for you. No, I
don't think he'll pit you against a man this time&mdash;probably
a lion. It may even be poison or a dagger&mdash;they are surer.
But what I am here for tonight is to try to save you. The only
trouble is, I have no plan. A friend of mine is captain of the
guard tonight. That is how I was able to reach you, but if I were
to leave your door unbarred and you escaped his life would not be
worth an obol. Perhaps you can think of a plan."</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "I shall have to know Tomos' plan
first. Right now the only plan I have is for you to leave before
you get caught in here."</p>

<p>"Isn't there anything that I can do, after all that you did
for me? There must be something."</p>

<p>"You might leave your dagger with me. It might come in handy.
I can hide it under my loin cloth."</p>

<p>They talked for a short time then before Gemnon left, and
within a few minutes thereafter Tarzan was asleep. He did not
pace his cell, fretting and worrying. His was more the
temperament of the wild animal than the man.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX. &mdash;
RETRIBUTION</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE sun is an impartial old devil. He shines
with equal brilliance upon the just and the banker, upon the day
of a man's wedding or upon the day of his death. The great
African sun, which, after all, is the same sun that shines on
Medicine Hat, shone brilliantly on this new day upon which Tarzan
was to die. He was to die because Alextar had decreed
it&mdash;the suggestion had been Tomos'. The sun even shone upon
Tomos; but then the sun is ninety-three million miles away, and
that is a long way to see what one is shining on.</p>

<p>They came about eleven o'clock in the morning and took Tarzan
from his cell. They did not even bother to bring him food or
water. What need has a man who is about to die for food or drink?
He was very thirsty; and perhaps, if he had asked, the guards
would have given him water; for after all they were common
soldiers and not a king's favorites, and therefore more inclined
to be generous and humane. The ape-man, however, asked for
nothing. It was not because he was consciously too proud; his
pride was something instinctive&mdash;it inhibited even a
suggestion that he might ask a favor of an enemy.</p>

<p>When he was brought out of the palace grounds onto the avenue,
the sight that met his eyes apprised him of the fate that had
been decreed for him. There was the procession of nobles and
warriors, the lion drawn chariot of the king, and a single great
lion held in leash by eight stalwart blacks. Tarzan had seen all
this before, that time that he had been the quarry in the Queen's
Hunt. Today he was to be the quarry in the King's Hunt, but today
he could expect no such miracle as had saved him from the mighty
jaws of Belthar upon that other occasion.</p>

<p>The same crowds of citizens lined the sides of the avenue; and
when the procession moved toward the Bridge of Gold and out
toward the Field of the Lions, the crowds moved with it. It was a
good natured crowd, such as one might see milling toward the
gates at a Cub-Giant game or the Army-Navy "classic." It was no
more bloody minded than those who throng to see Man Mountain Dean
and the Honorable Mr. Detton or a professional ice hockey game at
Madison Square Garden, and who would be so unkind as to suggest
that these are looking for trouble and blood? Perish the
thought!</p>

<p>They had taken no chances when they brought Tarzan from his
cell. Twenty spearmen betokened the respect in which they held
him. Now they chained him to Alextar's chariot, and the triumph
was under way.</p>

<p>Out upon the Field of the Lions the procession halted and the
long gauntlet of warriors was formed down which the quarry was to
be pursued by the lion. The ape-man was unchained, the wagers
were being laid as to the point in the gauntlet at which the lion
would overtake and drag down its victim, and the hunting lion was
being brought up to scent the quarry. Tomos was gloating. Alextar
appeared nervous&mdash;he was afraid of lions. He would never
have gone on a hunt of his own volition. Tarzan watched him. He
saw a young man in his late twenties with nervous, roving eyes, a
weak chin and a cruel mouth. There was nothing about him to
remind one that he was the brother of the gorgeous Nemone. He
looked at Tarzan, but his eyes fell before the steady gaze of the
ape-man.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" he snapped querulously. "We are bored."</p>

<p>They did hurry, and in their haste it happened. In a fraction
of a second the comparatively peaceful scene was transformed to
one of panic and chaos.</p>

<p>By accident one of the blacks that held the hunting lion in
leash slipped the beast's collar, and with an angry roar the
trained killer struck down those nearest him and charged the line
of spearmen standing between him and the crowd of spectators. He
was met by a dozen spears while the unarmed citizenry fled in
panic, trampling the weaker beneath their feet.</p>

<p>The nobles screamed commands. Alextar stood in his chariot,
his knees shaking, and begged some one to save him. "A hundred
thousand drachmas to the man who kills the beast!" he cried.
"More! Anything he may ask shall be granted!"</p>

<p>No one seemed to pay any attention to him. All who could were
looking after their own safety. As a matter of fact, he was in no
danger at the time; for the lion was engaged elsewhere.</p>

<p>The jabbing spears further enraged the maddened carnivore, yet
for some reason he did not follow up his attack upon the
warriors; instead, he wheeled suddenly and then charged straight
for the chariot of the king. Now, indeed, did Alextar have reason
to be terrified. He would have run, but his knees gave beneath
him so that he sat down upon the seat of his golden vehicle. He
looked about helplessly. He was practically alone. Some of his
noble guard had run to join in the attack upon the lion. Tomos
had fled in the opposite direction. Only the quarry remained.</p>

<p>Alextar saw the man whip a dagger from his loin cloth and
crouch in the path of the charging lion. He heard savage growls
roll from human lips. The lion was upon him. Alextar screamed;
but, fascinated, his terror-filled eyes clung to the savage scene
before him. He saw the lion rise to make the kill, and then what
happened happened so quickly that he could scarcely follow
it.</p>

<p>Tarzan stooped and dodged beneath the great forepaws
outstretched to seize him; then he closed in and swung to the
lion's back, one great arm encircling the shaggy throat. Mingled
with the beast's horrid growls were the growls of the man-beast
upon his back. Alextar went cold with terror. He tried to run,
but he could not. Whether he would or not, he must sit and watch
that awful spectacle&mdash;he must watch the lion kill the man
and then leap upon him. Yet the thing that terrified him most was
the growls of the man.</p>

<p>They were rolling upon the ground now in the dust of the Field
of the Lions, sometimes the man on top, sometimes the lion; and
now and again the dagger of Gemnon flashed in the sunlight,
flashed as the blade drove into the side of the frantic beast.
The two were ringed now by eager spearmen ready to thrust a point
into the heart of the lion, but no chance presented that did not
endanger the life of the man. But at last the end came. With a
final supreme effort to escape the clutches of the ape-man, the
lion collapsed upon the ground. The duel was over.</p>

<p>Tarzan leaped to his feet. For a moment he surveyed the
surrounding warriors with the blazing eyes of a beast of prey at
bay upon its kill; then he placed a foot upon the carcass of the
hunting lion, raised his face to the heavens, and from his great
chest rose the challenge of the bull ape.</p>

<p>The warriors shrank away as that weird and hideous cry
shattered the brief new silence of the Field of the Lions.
Alextar trembled anew. He had feared the lion, but he feared the
man more. Had he not had him brought here to be killed by the
very lion he had himself dispatched? And he was only a beast. His
growls and his terrible cry proved that. What mercy could he
expect from a beast? The man would kill him!</p>

<p>"Take him away!" he ordered feebly. "Take him away!"</p>

<p>"What shall we do with him?" asked a noble.</p>

<p>"Kill him! Kill him! Take him away!" Alextar was almost
screaming now.</p>

<p>"But he saved your life," the noble reminded.</p>

<p>"Huh? What? Oh, well; take him back to his cell. Later I shall
know what to do with him. Can't you see I am tired and don't wish
to be bothered?" he demanded querulously.</p>

<p>The noble hung his head in shame as he ordered the guard to
escort Tarzan back to his cell; and he walked at Tarzan's side,
where a noble does not walk except with one of his own caste.</p>

<p>"What you did," he remarked on the way back to the city,
"deserves better reward than this."</p>

<p>"I seem to recall hearing him offer anything he wished to the
man who killed the lion," said the ape-man. "That and a hundred
thousand drachmas."</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard him."</p>

<p>"He seems to have a short memory."</p>

<p>"What would you have asked him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>The noble looked at him in surprise. "You would ask for
nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Is there nothing that you want?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I wouldn't ask anything of an enemy."</p>

<p>"I am not your enemy."</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at the man, and a shadow of a smile lit his grim
visage. "I have had no water since yesterday, nor any food."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the noble, laughing, "you'll have them
both&mdash;and without asking for them."</p>

<p>On their return to the city Tarzan was placed in another cell;
this one was on the second floor of a wing of the palace that
overlooked the avenue. It was not long before the door was
unbolted and a warrior entered with food and water. As he placed
them on the end of the bench he looked at Tarzan admiringly.</p>

<p>"I was there and saw you kill the king's hunting lion," he
said. "It was such a thing as one may see only once in a
lifetime. I saw you fight with Phobeg before Nemone, the queen.
That, too, was something to have seen. You spared Phobeg's life
when you might have killed him, when all were screaming for the
kill. After that he would have died for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," replied the ape-man. "Is Phobeg still
alive?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very much; and he is still a temple guard."</p>

<p>"If you see him, tell him that I wish him well."</p>

<p>"That I will," promised the warrior. "I shall see him soon.
Now I must be going." He came close to Tarzan then, and spoke in
a whisper. "Drink no wine, and whoever comes keep your back to
the wall and be prepared to fight." Then he was gone.</p>

<p>"'Drink no wine,'" mused Tarzan. Wine, he knew, was the
medium in which poison was customarily administered in Cathne;
and if he kept his back to the wall no one could stab him from
behind. Good advice! The advice of a friend who might have
overheard something that prompted it. Tarzan knew that he had
many friends among the warriors of the City of Gold.</p>

<p>He walked to one of the windows and looked out upon the
avenue. He saw a lion striding majestically toward the center of
the city, paying no attention to the pedestrians or being noticed
by them. It was one of the many tame lions that roam the streets
of Cathne by day. Sometimes they fed upon the corpses thrown out
to them, but rarely did they attack a living man.</p>

<p>He saw a small gathering of people upon the opposite side of
the avenue. They were talking together earnestly, often glancing
toward the palace. Pedestrians stopped to listen and joined the
crowd. A warrior came from the palace and stopped and spoke to
them; then they looked up at the window where Tarzan stood. The
warrior was he who had brought food to Tarzan.</p>

<p>When the crowd recognized the ape-man it commenced to cheer.
People were coming from both directions, some of them running.
There were many warriors among them. The crowd and the tumult
grew. When darkness came torches were brought. A detachment of
warriors came from the palace. It was commanded by a noble who
sought to disperse the gathering.</p>

<p>Some one yelled, "Free Tarzan!" and the whole crowd took it
up, like a chant. A huge man came, bearing a torch. In its light
Tarzan recognized the man as Phobeg, the temple guard. He waved
his torch at Tarzan, and cried, "Shame, Alextar! Shame!" and the
crowd took that cry up and chanted it in unison.</p>

<p>The noble and the guardsmen sought to quiet and disperse them,
and then a fight ensued in which heads were broken and men were
slashed with swords and run through with spears. By this time the
mob had grown until it filled the avenue. Its temper was nasty,
and when once blood was spilled it went berserk. Before it the
palace guard was helpless, and those who survived were glad to
retreat to the safety of the palace.</p>

<p>Now some one shouted, "Down with Tomos! Death to Tomos!" and
the hoarse voice of the mob seized upon this new slogan. It
seemed to stir the men to new action, for now in a body they
moved down upon the palace gates.</p>

<p>As they hammered and shoved upon the sturdy portals, a man at
the outer fringe of the mob shouted, "The hunting lions! Alextar
has turned his hunting lions upon us! Death to Alextar!"</p>

<p>Tarzan looked down the avenue toward the royal stables; and
there, indeed, came fully fifty lions, held in leash by their
keepers. Excited by the vast crowd, irritated by the noise, they
tugged at their chains, while the night trembled to their
thunderous roars; but the crowd, aroused now to demonical
madness, was undaunted. Yet what could it do against this show of
savage force? It started to fall back, slowly, cursing and
growling, shouting defiance, calling for Tarzan's release.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, a low growl came from the chest of the ape-man,
a growl of protest that he was helpless to aid those who would
befriend him. He tested the bars in the window at which he stood.
To his strength and his weight they bent inward a little; then he
threw all that he had of both upon a single bar. It bent inward
and pulled from its sockets in the frame, the soft iron giving to
his giant strength. That was enough! One by one in quick
succession the remaining bars were dragged out and thrown upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Tarzan leaned from the window and looked down. Below him was
an enclosed courtyard. It was empty. A wall screened it from the
avenue beyond. He glanced into the avenue and saw that the crowd
was still falling back, the lions advancing. So intent were all
upon the lions that no one saw the ape-man slip through the
window and drop into the courtyard. Opposite him was a postern
gate, barred upon the inside. Through it he stepped into the
avenue just in front of the retreating crowd, between it and the
lions.</p>

<p>A dozen saw and recognized him at once; and a great shout went
up, a shout of defiance with a new note in it&mdash;a note of
renewed confidence and elation.</p>

<p>Tarzan seized a torch from one of the citizens. "Bring your
torches!" he commanded. "Torches and spears in the front line!"
Then he advanced to meet the lions, and the men with the torches
and the spears rushed forward to the front line. All that they
had needed was a leader.</p>

<p>All wild animals fear fire. The king of beasts is no
exception. The hunting lions of Alextar, king of Cathne, shrank
back when blazing torches were pushed into their faces. Their
keepers, shouting encouragement, cursing, were helpless. One of
the lions, his mane ablaze, turned suddenly to one side, fouling
another lion, causing him to wheel in terror and confusion and
bolt back toward the stables. In doing so, they crossed the
leashes of other lions, became entangled in them, and tore them
from the hands of the keepers. The freed lions hesitated only
long enough to maul the keepers that chanced to be in their way,
and then they too galloped back along the avenue toward the
stables.</p>

<p>Emboldened by this success, the torch bearers fell upon the
remaining lions, beating them with fire until the beasts were mad
with terror; and Tarzan, in the forefront, urged them on.
Pandemonium reigned. The hoarse shouts of the mob mingled with
the roars of the carnivores and the screams of stricken men. By
now the lions were frantic with terror. With leashes entangled,
keepers down, manes afire, they could stand no more. Those that
had not already broken and run, did so now. The mob was for
pursuing, but Tarzan stopped them. With raised hand he quieted
them after a moment.</p>

<p>"Let the lions go," he counselled. "There is bigger game. I am
going after Alextar and Tomos."</p>

<p>"And I am going with you," a big voice boomed beside him.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned and looked at the speaker. It was Phobeg, the
temple guard.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"We are going after Alextar and Tomos!" cried Phobeg.</p>

<p>A roar of approval rose from the crowd. "The gates!" some
cried. "To the gates! To the gates!"</p>

<p>"There is an easier way," said Tarzan. "Come!"</p>

<p>They followed him to the postern gate that he knew was
unbarred and through it into the palace grounds. Here, Tarzan
knew his way well; for he had been here both as a prisoner and a
guest of Nemone, the queen.</p>

<p><br>
ALEXTAR and a few of his nobles were dining. The king was
frightened; for not only could he hear the shouts of the mob, but
he was kept constantly informed of all that was occurring outside
the palace, and knew that the hunting lions he had been certain
would disperse the rioters had been turned back and were in
flight. He had sent every available fighting man in the palace to
the gates when the shouts of the crowd indicated that it was
about to storm them, and though assured by his nobles that the
mob could not hope to overcome his warriors, even if the gates
failed to hold against them, he was still terrified.</p>

<p>"It is your fault, Tomos," he whined. "You said to lock the
wild-man up, and now look what has happened! The people want to
dethrone me. They may even kill me. What shall I do? What can I
do?"</p>

<p>Tomos was in no better state of nerves than the king, for he
had heard the people calling for his death. He cast about for
some plan that might save him, and presently he thought of
one.</p>

<p>"Send for the wild-man," he said, "and set him free. Give him
money and honors. Send word at once to the gates that you have
done this."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," assented Alextar; and, turning to one of his
nobles, "Go at once and fetch the wild-man; and you, go to the
gates and tell the people what has been done."</p>

<p>"Later," said Tomos, "we can offer him a cup of wine."</p>

<p>The first noble crossed the room hurriedly and threw open a
door leading into a corridor from which he could ascend to the
second floor where Tarzan had been imprisoned, but he did not
cross the threshold. In dismay he stepped back into the room.</p>

<p>"Here is Tarzan now!" he cried.</p>

<p>Alextar and Tomos and the others sprang to their feet as the
opened door let in the murmurings of the crowd that followed the
ape-man; then Tarzan stepped into the room, and crowding behind
him came Phobeg and the others.</p>

<p>Alextar arose to flee, as did Tomos also; but with a bound
Tarzan crossed the room and seized them. No noble drew a sword in
defense of the king; like rats fleeing a sinking ship they were
ready to desert Alextar. So great was his terror, the man was in
a state of collapse. He went to his knees and begged for his
life.</p>

<p>"You do not understand," he cried. "I had just given orders to
release you. I was going to give you money&mdash;I will give you
money&mdash;I will make you a lion-man&mdash;I will give you a
palace, slaves, everything."</p>

<p>"You should have thought of all this on the Field of the Lions
today, now it is too late. Not that I would have what you offer,"
the ape-man added, "but it might have saved your life temporarily
and your throne, too, because then your people would not have
grown so angry and disgusted."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to me?" demanded the king.</p>

<p>"I am going to do nothing to you," replied Tarzan. "What your
people do to you is none of my concern, but if they don't make
Thudos king they are fools."</p>

<p>Now Thudos was the first of the nobles, as Tarzan knew; and in
his veins flowed better blood from an older line than the king of
Cathne could claim. He was a famous old warrior, loved and
respected by the people; and when the crowd in the room heard
Tarzan they shouted for Thudos; and those in the corridor carried
it back out into the avenue, and the word spread through the
city.</p>

<p>Alextar heard, and his face went ashen white. He must have
gone quite mad, as his sister before him. He came slowly to his
feet and faced Tomos. "You have done this to me," he said. "For
years you kept me in prison. You ruined my sister's
life&mdash;you and M'duze. You have ruined my life, and now you
have lost me my throne. But you shall never ruin another life,"
and with that he drew his sword so quickly that none could stay
him and brought the blade down with all his strength on Tomos's
skull, cleaving it to the nose.</p>

<p>As the body slumped to his feet he broke into maniacal
laughter, while those in the room stood stunned and silent; then,
as quickly as he had done before, he placed the point of his
sword at his heart and threw himself forward upon it.</p>

<p>Thus died Alextar, the last of the mad rulers of Cathne.</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20">XX. &mdash; ATHNE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE main gate of Athne, the City of Ivory, looks
toward the south; for in that direction runs the trail that leads
to Cathne the City of Gold, the stronghold of the hereditary
enemies of the Athneans. In that direction ride the warriors and
the nobles of Athne seeking women and heads and other loot; from
that direction come the raiding parties from Cathne, also seeking
women and heads and other loot; so the main gate of Athne is
strong and well guarded. It is surmounted by two squat towers in
which warriors watch by day and by night.</p>

<p>Before the gate is a great level plain where the elephants are
trained and the warriors of Athne drill upon their mighty mounts.
It is dusty, and nothing grows there but a sturdy Cynodon; and
even that survives the trampling pads of the pachyderms only in
scattered patches. The fields of the Athneans lie north of the
city, and there the slaves labor; so one might approach the city
from the south without glimpsing a sign of human life.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon. The hot sun beat down upon the
watchtowers. The warriors, languid with the heat, gamed at
dice&mdash;those who were not on watch. Presently one of the
latter spoke.</p>

<p>"A man comes from the south," he said.</p>

<p>"How many?" asked one of the players.</p>

<p>"I said <i>a</i> man. I see but one."</p>

<p>"Then we do not have to give the alarm. But who could come
alone to Athne? Is it a man from Cathne?"</p>

<p>"There have been deserters come to us before. Perhaps this is
one."</p>

<p>"He is yet too far off to see plainly," said the warrior who
had discovered the stranger, "but he does not look like a
Cathnean. His dress seems strange to me."</p>

<p>He went to the inner side of the tower then and, leaning over
the edge of the parapet, called the captain of the guard. An
officer came from the interior of the tower and looked up.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Some one is coming from the south," explained the
warrior.</p>

<p>The officer nodded and mounted the ladder leading to the
tower's top. The warriors stopped their game then, and all went
to the southern parapet to have a look at the stranger. He was
nearer now, and they could see that he wore garments strange to
them.</p>

<p>"He is no Cathnean," said the officer, "but he is either a
fool or a brave man to come thus alone to Athne."</p>

<p>As Stanley Wood neared the gates of Athne he saw the warriors
in the watchtowers observing him, and when he came quite close
they challenged him but in a language he could not
understand.</p>

<p>"Friend," he said, and raised his hand in the peace sign.</p>

<p>Presently the gate opened and an officer and several warriors
came out. They tried to talk with him, and when they found that
neither could understand the other they formed about him and
escorted him through the gateway.</p>

<p>He found himself at the end of an avenue lined with low
buildings occupied by shops. The warriors who had brought him
into the city were white as were most of the people on the
avenue, although there were some Negroes. Everyone appeared much
interested in him; and he was soon surrounded by a large crowd,
all talking at once, pointing, feeling of his clothes and
weapons. The latter were soon taken from him by his guard, the
officer shouted some commands, and the warriors pushed the people
out of the way and started up the avenue with Wood.</p>

<p>He felt very uncomfortable and helpless because of his
inability to converse with those about him. There were so many
questions he wished to ask. Gonfala might be in this city and yet
he might never know it if he could not ask anyone about her who
could understand him. He determined that the first thing he must
do was to learn the language of these people. He wondered if they
would be friendly. The fact that they were white gave him
hope.</p>

<p>Who could they be? Their garb, so different from anything
modern, gave him no clue. They might have stepped from the pages
of ancient history, so archaic were their weapons and their
raiment; but he could not place them exactly. Where did they
originate, these strange, rather handsome men and women? How and
when did they reach this unknown valley in Africa? Could they be
descendants of some Atlantean colonists stranded here after the
submergence of their continent?</p>

<p>Vain speculations. No matter who they were, they were here;
and he was either their prisoner or their guest&mdash;the former,
he was inclined to believe. One did not usually surround a guest
by armed warriors.</p>

<p>As they proceeded along the avenue Wood observed more closely
the raiment of his escort and of the people whom they passed. The
officer in charge was a handsome, black haired fellow who strode
along apparently oblivious of those they passed, yet there was
nothing offensive about his manner. If there were social castes
here, Wood hazarded a safe guess that this man was of the
nobility. The headband that confined his hair supported a carved
ivory ornament at the center of his forehead, an ornament that
was shaped like a concave, curved trowel, the point of which
projected above the top of the man's head and curved forward. He
wore wristlets and anklets of long, flat strips of ivory laid
close together and fastened around his limbs by leather thongs
that were laced through holes piercing the strips near their tops
and bottoms. Sandals of elephant hide encasing his feet were
supported by leather thongs fastened to the bottoms of his
anklets. On each arm, below the shoulder, was an ivory disc upon
which was a carved device; about his neck was a band of smaller
ivory discs elaborately carved, and from the lowest of these a
strap ran down to a leather habergeon, which was also supported
by shoulder straps. Depending from each side of his headband was
another ivory disc of large size, above which was a smaller disc,
the former covering his ears. Heavy, curved, wedge-shaped pieces
of ivory were held, one upon each shoulder, by the same straps
that supported his habergeon. He was armed with a dagger and a
short sword.</p>

<p>The warriors who accompanied him were similarly garbed, but
less elaborately in the matter of carved ivory; and their
habergeons and sandals were of coarser leather more roughly
fabricated. Upon the back of each was a small shield. The common
warriors carried short, heavy spears as well as swords and
daggers. From their arms, Wood concluded that what he had first
supposed to be ivory ornaments were definitely protective
armour.</p>

<p>The American was conducted to a large, walled enclosure in the
center of the city. Here stood the most elaborate buildings he
had seen. There was a large central structure and many smaller
buildings, the whole set in a parklike garden of considerable
beauty which covered an area of several acres.</p>

<p>Just inside the gate was a small building before which lolled
a score of warriors. Within, an officer sat at a table; and to
him Wood was taken, and here the officer who had brought him
evidently made his report. What passed between them Wood could
not, of course, understand; but when the first officer left he
realized that he had been delivered into the custody of the
other.</p>

<p>While similarly garbed, this second officer did not give the
impression of birth or breeding that had been so noticeable in
the first. He was a burly, uncouth appearing fellow with much
less in his appearance to recommend him than many of the common
warriors Wood had seen. When left alone with his prisoner he
commenced to shout questions at him; and when he found that Wood
could not understand him, or he Wood, he pounded on the table
angrily.</p>

<p>Finally he summoned warriors to whom he issued instructions,
and once again Wood was taken under escort. This time he was led
to an enclosure toward the rear of the grounds not far from a
quite large one-storied building with the interior of which he
was destined to become well acquainted.</p>

<p>He was thrust into an enclosure along the north side of which
was an open shed in which were some fifty men. A high fence or
stockade formed the remaining three sides of the quadrangle, the
outside of which was patrolled by warriors; and Wood realized now
that he was definitely a prisoner and far from being either an
important or favored one, as the other inmates of the stockade
were for the most part filthy, unkempt fellows, both white and
black.</p>

<p>As Wood approached the enclosure every eye was upon him; and
he knew that they were commenting upon him; and, from the tone of
an occasional laugh, judged that he was the butt of many a rough
quip. He sensed antagonism and felt more alone than he would have
in solitary confinement; and then he heard his name called by
some one in the midst of the assemblage in the shed.</p>

<p>Immediately two men separated themselves from the others and
came to meet him. They were Spike and Troll. A wave of anger
swept through the American as the implication of their presence
here pointed them out as the abductors of Gonfala.</p>

<p>His face must have betrayed his emotions as he advanced toward
them; for Spike raised his hand in a gesture of warning.</p>

<p>"Hold on, now," he cried. "Gettin' hostile ain't goin' to get
us no place. We're in a Hell of a fix here, an' gettin' hostile
ain't goin' to help matters none. It'll be better for all of us
if we work together."</p>

<p>"Where's Gonfala?" demanded Wood. "What have you done with
her?"</p>

<p>"They took her away from us the day they captured us," said
Troll. "We ain't seen her since."</p>

<p>"We understand she's in the palace," said Spike. "They say the
big guy here has fell for her. He's got her an' the Gonfal, the
dirty bounder."</p>

<p>"What did you steal her for?" Wood demanded. "If either one of
you harmed her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harm her!" exclaimed Troll. "You don't think I'd never let
nobody harm my sister, do you?"</p>

<p>Spike winked behind Troll's back and tapped his forehead.
"They ain't nobody harmed her," he assured Wood, "unless it was
done after they took her away from us. And for why did we bring
'er along with us? We had to 'ave 'er. We couldn't work the
Gonfal without 'er."</p>

<p>"That damned stone!" muttered Wood.</p>

<p>"I think they's a curse on it myself," agreed Spike. "It ain't
never brought nobody nothin' but bad luck. Look at me and Troll.
Wot we got for our pains? We lost the emerald; now we lost the
Gonfal, an' all we do is shovel dirt out o' the elephant barns
all day an' wait to see w'ich way they's goin' to croak us."</p>

<p>As they talked they were surrounded by other prisoners
prompted by curiosity to inspect the latest recruit. They
questioned Wood; but, as he could not understand them nor they
he, they directed their questions upon Spike who replied in a
strange jargon of African dialects, signs, and the few words of
the Athnean language he had picked up. It was a wholly remarkable
means of conveying thoughts, but it apparently served its purpose
admirably.</p>

<p>As Wood stood there, the object of their interest, he was
rapidly considering the attitude he should assume toward Spike
and Troll. The men were scoundrels of the first water, and could
command only his bitterest enmity. For the wrong that they had
done Gonfala it seemed to Wood that they deserved death; yet they
were the only men here with whom he could talk, the only ones
with whom he had any interests in common. His judgment told him
that Spike had been right when he said that they should work
together. For the time being, then, he would put aside his just
anger against them and throw his lot in with them in the hope
that in some way they might be of service to Gonfala.</p>

<p>"They wants to know who you are an' where you comes from,"
said Spike; "an' I told 'em you come from a country a thousand
times bigger than Athne an' that you was a juke or somethin',
like their officers. They's one of 'em in here with us. See that
big bloke over there standin' with his arms folded?" He pointed
to a tall, fine looking fellow who had not come forward with the
others. "He's a toff, or I never seen one. He don't never have no
truck with these scrubs; but he took a shine to Troll and me, an'
is learnin' us his language."</p>

<p>"I'd like to meet him," said Wood, for his first interest now
was to learn the language of these people into whose hands fate
had thrown him.</p>

<p>"Awright, come on over. He ain't a bad bloke. He's wot they
calls an elephant-man. That's somethin' like bein' a juke at
home. They had some sort of a revolution here a few months ago,
an' killed off a lot of these here elephant-men, wot didn't
escape or join the revolutionists. But this bloke wasn't killed.
They say it was because he was a good guy an' everybody liked
him, even the revolutionists. He wouldn't join 'em; so they stuck
him in here to do chamber work for the elephants. These here
revolutionists is like the gangsters in your country. Anyway,
they's a bad lot, always makin' trouble for decent people an'
stealin' wot they ain't got brains enough to make for themselves.
Well, here we are. Valthor, shake hands with my old friend
Stanley Wood."</p>

<p>Valthor looked puzzled, but he took Wood's outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>"Cripes!" exclaimed Spike. "I'm always forgettin' you don't
know no English." Then he couched the introduction in the bastard
language he had picked up.</p>

<p>Valthor smiled and acknowledged the introduction.</p>

<p>"He says he's glad to meetcha," translated Spike.</p>

<p>"Tell him it's fifty-fifty," said the American, "and ask him
if he'll help me learn his language."</p>

<p>When Spike had translated this speech Valthor smiled and
nodded, and there immediately began an association that not only
developed into a genuine friendship during the ensuing weeks but
gave Wood a sufficient knowledge of the Athnean language to
permit free intercourse with all with whom he came in
contact.</p>

<p>During this time he worked with the other slaves in the great
elephant stables of Phoros, the dictator who had usurped the
crown of Athne after the revolution. The food was poor and
insufficient, the work arduous, and the treatment he received
harsh; for the officers who were put in charge of the slaves had
been men of the lowest class prior to the revolution and found a
vent for many an inhibition when they were given a little
authority.</p>

<p>During all this time he heard nothing of the fate of Gonfala,
for naturally little news of the palace reached the slaves in the
stables. Whether she lived or not, he could not know; and this
state of constant uncertainty and anxiety told even more heavily
upon him than did the hardships he was forced to undergo.</p>

<p>"If she is beautiful," Valthor had told him, "I think you need
have no fear for her life. We do not take the lives of beautiful
women&mdash;even the Erythra would not do that."</p>

<p>"Who are the Erythra?" asked Wood.</p>

<p>"The men who overthrew the government and placed Phoros on the
throne of Zygo, king of Athne."</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful," said Wood. "I wish to God she were
not so beautiful."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will do her no harm. If I know Menofra, and I
think I do, your friend will be safe from the attentions of
Phoros at least; and if I know Phoros, he will not let any one
else have her if she is very beautiful. He will always wait and
hope&mdash;hope that something will happen to Menofra."</p>

<p>"And who might Menofra be?"</p>

<p>"Above all else she is a she-devil for jealousy, and she is
the wife of Phoros."</p>

<p>This was slight comfort, but it was the best that was
vouchsafed Wood. He could only wait and hope. There was little
upon which to base a plan of action. Valthor had told him that
there might be a counterrevolution to unseat Phoros and return
Zygo to the throne; but in the slaves' compound there was little
information upon which to base even a conjecture as to when, if
ever, this might take place; as there was no means of
communication between those confined there and Zygo's
sympathizers in the city, while Zygo and most of his loyal nobles
and retainers were hiding in the mountains to which they had
escaped when revolution overwhelmed the city.</p>

<p>Among other duties that had fallen to the lot of Wood was the
exercising of the elephant that was his particular charge. He had
been chosen for this work, along with Valthor, Spike, and Troll,
because of his greater intelligence than the ordinary run of
slaves in the compound. He had learned quickly, and rode almost
daily on the plain south of the city under a heavy escort of
warriors.</p>

<p>They had returned to the stables one day from the field after
the exercise period, which was always early in the morning, and
were brushing and washing their huge mounts, when they were
ordered to remount and ride out.</p>

<p>On the way to the plain they learned from the accompanying
warriors that they were being sent out to capture a wild elephant
that had been damaging the fields.</p>

<p>"They say he's a big brute and ugly," offered one of the
warriors, "and if he's as bad as all that we won't all of us come
back."</p>

<p>"Under Zygo, the nobles rode out to capture wild elephants,
not slaves," said Valthor.</p>

<p>The warrior rode his mount closer to the Athnean noble. "They
are all too drunk to ride," he said, lowering his voice. "If they
were just a little drunk they might ride. If they were not drunk
at all they would not have the nerve. We warriors are sick of
them. Most of us would like to ride again under real elephant-men
like your nobleness."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will," said Valthor, "&mdash;if you have the
nerve."</p>

<p>"Hi-yah!" shouted a warrior ahead of them.</p>

<p>"They've sighted him," Valthor explained to Wood, who was
riding at his side.</p>

<p>Presently they too saw the quarry emerging from a bamboo
forest at the edge of the plain.</p>

<p>Valthor whistled. "He's a big brute, and if he's as ugly as
they say we should have some real sport. But it's murder to send
inexperienced slaves against him. Watch out for yourself, Wood.
Just keep out of his way, no matter what the guards tell you to
do. Make believe you can't control your elephant. Look at him!
He's coming right for us. He's a bad one all right&mdash;not a
bit afraid of us either, by Dyaus."</p>

<p>"I never saw a larger one," said Wood.</p>

<p>"Nor I," admitted Valthor, "though I've seen many an elephant
in my time. He's got a blemish though&mdash;look at that tusk.
It's much darker than the other. If it weren't for that he'd make
a king's elephant all right."</p>

<p>"What are we supposed to do?" asked Wood. "I don't see how we
could ever capture that fellow if he didn't want us to."</p>

<p>"They'll have some females ridden close to him, and try to
work him gently toward the city and into the big corral just
inside the gate. Look at that, now!"</p>

<p>Up went the big elephant's trunk, and he trumpeted angrily. It
was evident that he was about to charge. The officer in command
shouted orders to the slaves to ride the females toward him, but
the officer did not advance. Like the other three with him, he
was an Erythros and not of the noble class. Not having their
pride or their code of honor, he could order others into danger
while he remained in comparative safety.</p>

<p>Some of the slaves moved forward, but with no great show of
enthusiasm; then the great beast charged. He barged right through
the line of advancing females, scattering them to right and left,
and charged for the bull ridden by the officer in command.</p>

<p>Screaming commands, the officer sought to turn his mount and
escape; but the bull he rode was a trained fighting elephant
which knew little about running away; besides, his harem of cows
was there; and he was not going to relinquish that to any strange
bull without a battle; so, torn between his natural inclinations
and his habit of obedience to the commands of his rider, he
neither faced the oncoming bull nor turned tail toward him; but
swung half way around, broadside, in his indecision. And in this
position the great stranger struck him with almost the momentum
of a locomotive run amok.</p>

<p>Down he went, pitching the officer heavily to the ground; but
the fellow was up instantly and running&mdash;by far the
stupidest thing he could have done; for almost any animal will
pursue a thing that flees.</p>

<p>Hoarse screams for help mingled with the trumpeting of the
wild bull as the latter bore down upon his fleeing victim.
Valthor urged the female he rode into a trot in an effort to head
off the charge and distract the bull's attention, and Wood
followed behind him; just why, he could not have explained.</p>

<p>Valthor was too late. The bull overtook the terrified man,
tossed him three times, and then trampled him into the dust of
the plain until he was only a darker spot on the barren
ground.</p>

<p>It was then that Valthor and Wood arrived. Wood expected
nothing less than a repetition of the scene he had just witnessed
with either himself or Valthor as the victim, but nothing of the
kind happened.</p>

<p>The Athnean rode his cow quietly close to the great bull,
which stood complacently switching its tail, all the madness
having apparently passed out of him with the killing of his
victim; and Wood, following the example of Valthor, closed in
gently on the other side.</p>

<p>All this time Valthor was chanting in a low, sing-song
monotone a wordless song used by the elephant-men of Athne to
soothe the great beasts in moods of nervousness or irritation;
and now to the cadence of his chant he added words of instruction
to Wood so that the two might work in harmony to bring the wild
bull to the city and into the corral.</p>

<p>Between the two cows, which knew their parts well, the bull
was guided to captivity; while the officers, the warriors, and
the slaves trailed behind, happy and relieved that they had not
been called upon to risk their lives.</p>

<p>Valthor already held the respect of his fellow prisoners as
well as of the warriors who guarded them, and now Wood took his
place as a person of importance among them.</p>

<p>That word of the manner of the capture of the wild elephant
had reached the palace Wood had proof the following day when an
officer and a detail of warriors came to take him into the
presence of Phoros.</p>

<p>"He wishes to see the fellow who helped Valthor capture the
rogue," said the officer.</p>

<p>Valthor leaned close and whispered, "He has some other reason.
He would not send for you just for that."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21">XXI. &mdash; PHOROS</a></h2>

<p class="first">NIGHT was creeping stealthily out of its lair in
the east, bringing its following of mystery and dark deeds and
strange beasts that are not seen by day. Though the sun still
colored the western sky with a fading tinge of red it was already
dark and gloomy in The Pass of the Warriors that leads from the
valley of Onthar to the valley of Thenar.</p>

<p>In Onthar is Cathne, the City of Gold; in Thenar is Athne, the
City of Ivory; in The Pass of the Warriors was Tarzan of the
Apes. Alone, he was going to Athne seeking a clue to the
whereabouts of Gonfala.</p>

<p>Gemnon had tried to dissuade him from going without an escort;
and so had Thudos, whom he had helped to seat upon the throne of
Cathne.</p>

<p>"If you are not back within a reasonable time," Thudos told
him, "I shall send an army to Athne to bring you back."</p>

<p>"If I am not back in a reasonable time," suggested the ape-
man, "it may be because I shall be dead."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed Thudos, "but they will not kill you unless
they have to. They are always hard pressed to find enough slaves
to carry on the work of the city, and they'd never destroy such a
fine specimen as you. Like us, they also need men to fight in the
arena."</p>

<p>"You would like that better than scrubbing elephants," said
Gemnon, smiling.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "I do not like to fight or to kill, and
there are worse things than scrubbing elephants."</p>

<p>And so he had gone, choosing to travel so that he would not
have to cross the valley of Thenar by day, as he wished to
approach and reconnoiter Athne unseen. That both valleys,
especially Onthar, harbored many wild lions was a hazard he had
to accept; but, except for the actual crossing of Thenar, he
could take advantage of the protection of forests practically all
of the way.</p>

<p>The hazard was great, for the lions of Thenar were not all
ordinary lions. Many of them were escaped hunting lions of Cathne
which had been often fed with human flesh and trained to hunt
men. For generations they had been bred for speed and endurance;
so that in all the world there were no such formidable beasts of
prey as these.</p>

<p>As night fell, Tarzan heard the roars of the great cats in the
valley he had quitted. With every sense alert he passed through
The Pass of the Warriors and entered the valley of Thenar. As yet
he had heard no lion roar coming from that direction. The wind
was in his face. It brought no scent spoor of Numa, but he knew
that it was carrying his scent back in the direction of the
hunting lions of Cathne.</p>

<p>He increased his speed, for though he had killed many a lion
he knew that no living creature could hope to survive an attack
by these beasts that often hunted in packs.</p>

<p>He was out now upon the open plain of Thenar. He could still
hear the roaring of the lions in Onthar. Suddenly they took on a
new note. He knew it well. It told him that they had picked up
the trail of some creature and marked it as their quarry. Was it
his trail?</p>

<p>A full moon rose above the mountains ahead of him, lighting
the floor of the valley, revealing the dark strip of forest far
ahead. The savage voices of the lions grew louder, reverberating
in the canyon called The Pass of the Warriors, through which he
had just come; then Tarzan knew that the hunting lions of Cathne
were on his trail.</p>

<p>You or I could not have counted the lions by their voices; but
to Tarzan the distinctive quality or character of each voice was
discernible, and thus he knew that five lions were loping
relentlessly to the kill. Once more he quickened his pace.</p>

<p>He judged that the lions were about a mile in the rear of him,
the forest about three miles ahead. If no obstacle intervened he
could reach the forest ahead of the lions; but he was crossing an
unfamiliar terrain known to him only by the descriptions given
him by Gemnon and Thudos, and he knew that there might easily be
some peculiarity of the topography of the floor of the valley
that would delay him&mdash;a deep dry wash with overhanging banks
of soft dirt would do it.</p>

<p>On he trotted, his great chest rising and falling regularly,
his heartbeats scarcely accelerated by the exertion; but the
lions came even more swiftly. He knew from the sound of their
voices that they were gaining on him. Knowing them, even as he
did, he marvelled at their endurance, so unusual in lions, and
was amazed at the results that could be attained by careful
breeding. Now, for the first time, he broke into a run; for he
knew that the moment they sighted him they would come on much
faster than he could run for any great distance. It then would be
just a question as to which could maintain the greatest speed for
the longest distance.</p>

<p>No washes intervened nor other obstacle, and he came at last
to within half a mile of the forest with sufficient distance and
time to spare to assure him a reasonable margin of safety; then
the unforeseen occurred. From the shadows of the forest a great
lion stepped into view before him.</p>

<p>Those who would live long in the jungle must think quickly.
Tarzan weighed the entire situation without losing a stride. The
forest was his goal; one lion was less of a menace than five, and
the one lion was all that stood between him and the forest. With
a savage growl he charged the lion.</p>

<p>The beast had started to trot toward him; but now he stopped
hesitant. Would he hold his ground or would he break? Much
depended upon whether he was an ordinary wild lion or a trained
hunting lion. From the fact that he hesitated instead of carrying
through his charge Tarzan guessed that he was the former.</p>

<p>The five lions from Onthar were gaining rapidly now. In the
bright moonlight they must have caught sight of their quarry.
Their voices proclaimed that. Now they were charging. Had they
been wild lions they would have hunted in silence once their prey
was marked, but the earth fairly trembled to their roars. Tarzan
thought that they wasted too much energy thus, but he knew that
they were trained to it so that the huntsmen could follow them
even when they were out of sight.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw that the lion facing him was wavering. He was
probably surprised at the tactics of the man-thing, at a quarry
that charged him; and the roars of the five lions doubtless added
to his nervousness. Only fifty yards separated them, and the lion
had not made up his mind, when from the chest of the ape-man
burst the savage challenge of the bull ape. It was the last
straw&mdash;the lion wheeled and bounded back into the forest. A
moment later Tarzan swarmed up a friendly tree as five angry
lions leaped to seize him.</p>

<p>Finding a comfortable resting place the ape-man broke off dead
branches and threw them at the lions, calling them Dango, Ungo,
Horta, and other insulting names, ascribing vile tastes and
habits to themselves and their ancestors. A quiet, almost
taciturn, man, he was as adept in the use of the jungle
billingsgate he had acquired from the great apes among which he
had been raised. Perhaps the lions understood him; perhaps they
did not. Who knows? Anyhow, they were very angry; and leaped high
in air in vain efforts to reach him, which only made them
angrier. But Tarzan had no time to waste upon them; and, keeping
to the trees, he swung away toward the north and Athne.</p>

<p>He had timed himself to reach the city while it slept, and
knew how to approach it from information given him by Gemnon and
Thudos who had often visited Athne during the yearly truces when
the two cities traded with one another. He passed half way around
the city to the north side, which was less well guarded than the
south.</p>

<p>Here he faced the greatest danger of discovery, for he must
scale the wall in the light of a full moon. He chose a place far
from the north gate, and crept toward the city on his belly
through the garden stuff growing in the cultivated fields. He
stopped often to look and listen, but he saw no sign of life on
the city wall.</p>

<p>When he had come to within about a hundred feet of the wall,
he arose and ran toward it at top speed, scaling it like a cat
until his fingers closed upon the coping; then he drew himself
up; and, lying flat, looked down upon the other side. A shedlike
building abutted against the wall, and beyond this was a narrow
street. Tarzan slipped to the roof of the shed, and a moment
later dropped into the street.</p>

<p>Instantly a head was thrust from an open window and a man's
voice demanded, "What are you doing there? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Daimon," replied Tarzan in a husky whisper. Instantly
the head was withdrawn and the window slammed shut. Tarzan, quick
witted, had profited by something that Gemnon had told
him&mdash;that the Athneans believed in a bad spirit that was
abroad at night seeking whom it might kill. To Daimon they
attributed all unexplained deaths, especially those that occurred
at night.</p>

<p>Following the directions he had received, Tarzan moved through
the narrow, shadowed streets toward the center of the city,
coming at last to the walled enclosure where the palace stood. He
had been told that here he would find guards only at the north
and south gates. Other gates, if there were any, were securely
fastened and seldom used.</p>

<p>As Tarzan approached the enclosure from the west, he
encountered no gate and no guards. The wall was low compared with
that which surrounded the city, and so proved no obstacle to the
ape-man. Once over the wall he found himself in a garden of
trees, shrubs, and flowers, a lovely place of soft, sweet
fragrances; but for these he had no senses at the moment&mdash;he
was searching for other scents than those of flowers.</p>

<p>Winding among small buildings and other gardens he came to a
large building that he knew must be the palace; and here, to his
surprise, he saw several rooms brilliantly lighted. He had
thought that all would be asleep with the exception of the
guards.</p>

<p>A number of old trees grew in the garden court that flanked
this side of the palace, and in the security of their shadows
Tarzan crossed to the building and looked in at one of the
windows. Here he saw a large banquet hall down the length of
which ran a long table at which a hundred or more men were
seated, most of them in various stages of drunkenness.</p>

<p>There was much loud talk and laughter, and a couple of fights
were in progress in which no one took any interest except the
contestants. The men were, for the most part, coarse, common
appearing fellows, not at all like the nobles of Cathne. The man
at the head of the table was quite bestial in appearance. He
pounded on the table with a great ham of a fist, and bellowed
more like a bull than a man.</p>

<p>Slaves were coming and going, bringing more drink and removing
empty goblets and dishes. Some of the guests were still eating,
but most of them concentrated their energies and their talents
upon the principal business of the evening&mdash;drinking.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you to fetch her?" shouted the large man at the
head of the table, addressing the assemblage in general.</p>

<p>"Told who to bring what?" inquired another seated farther
toward the foot of the table.</p>

<p>"The girl," shouted the large man.</p>

<p>"What girl, Phoros?"</p>

<p>"THE girl," replied Phoros drunkenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, THE girl," said someone.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you bring her?"</p>

<p>"Bring who?"</p>

<p>"Bring THE girl," repeated Phoros.</p>

<p>"Who bring her?" asked another.</p>

<p>"You bring her," ordered Phoros.</p>

<p>The fellow addressed shook his head. "Not me," he said.
"Menofra'd have the hide off me."</p>

<p>"She won't know. She's gone to bed," Phoros assured him.</p>

<p>"I ain't takin' any chances. Send a slave."</p>

<p>"You'd better not send anyone," counselled a man sitting next
to Phoros, one who did not seem as drunk as the others. "Menofra
would cut her heart out and yours too."</p>

<p>"Who's king?" demanded Phoros.</p>

<p>"Ask Menofra," suggested the other.</p>

<p>"I'm king," asserted Phoros. He turned to a slave. The fellow
happened to be looking in another direction. Phoros threw a heavy
goblet at him, which barely missed his head. "Here, you! Go fetch
the girl."</p>

<p>"What girl, master?" asked the trembling slave.</p>

<p>"There's only one girl in Athne, you son of a wart hog! Go get
her!"</p>

<p>The slave hurried from the room. Then there ensued a
discussion as to what Menofra would do if she found out. Phoros
announced that he was tired of Menofra, and that if she didn't
mind her own business he'd take her apart and forget to put her
together again. He thought this such a good joke that he laughed
immoderately and fell off his bench, but some of the others
seemed nervous and looked apprehensively toward the doorway.</p>

<p>Tarzan watched and listened. He felt disgust and
shame&mdash;shame, because he belonged to the same species as
these creatures. Since infancy he had been fellow of the beasts
of the forest and the plain, the lower orders; yet he had never
seen them sink to the level of man. Most of them had courage and
dignity of a sort; seldom did they stoop to buffoonery, with the
possible exception of the lesser monkeys, who were most closely
allied to man. Had he been impelled to theorize he would
doubtless have reversed Darwin's theory of evolution. But his
mind was occupied with another thought&mdash;who was "THE girl"?
He wondered if she might not be Gonfala, but further speculation
was discouraged by the coming of a large, masculine looking woman
who strode into the room followed by the slave who had just been
dispatched to bring the girl. So this was the girl! Tarzan looked
at her in mild astonishment. She had large, red hands, a
whiskered mole on her chin, and quite a noticeable mustache. In
other respects she was quite as unlovely.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" she demanded, glaring at Phoros.
"Why did you send for me at this time in the morning, you drunken
lout?"</p>

<p>Phoros' jaw dropped; he looked wildly about at his companions
as though seeking help; but he got none. Each of those who had
not passed out completely was engaged in trying to appear
dignified and sober.</p>

<p>"My dear," explained Phoros ingratiatingly, "we wanted you to
join us and help celebrate."</p>

<p>"'My dear' nothing!" snapped the woman; then her eyes
narrowed. "Celebrate what?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Phoros looked about him helplessly. Bleary eyed and belching,
he looked foolishly at the man sitting next him. "What were we
celebrating, Kandos?"</p>

<p>Kandos fidgeted, and moistened his dry lips with his
tongue.</p>

<p>"Don't lie to me!" screamed the woman. "The truth is that you
never intended to send for me."</p>

<p>"Now, Menofra!" exclaimed Phoros in what was intended to be a
soothing tone.</p>

<p>The woman wheeled on the frightened slave behind her. "Were
you told to fetch me?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, great queen! I thought he meant you," whimpered the
slave, dropping to his knees.</p>

<p>"What did he say to you?" Menofra's voice was raised almost to
a shriek.</p>

<p>"He said 'Go fetch the girl!' and when I asked him what girl,
he said, 'There's only one girl in Athne, you son of a wart
hog!'"</p>

<p>Menofra's eyes narrowed menacingly. "The only girl in Athne,
eh? I know who you sent for&mdash;it's that yellow-haired hussy
that was brought in with the two men. You think you been fooling
me, don't you? Well, you haven't. You just been waiting for your
chance, and tonight you got drunk enough to muster up a little
courage. Well, I'll attend to you; and when I get through with
you, I'll fix the only girl in Athne. I'll send her to you, if
there's anything left of you&mdash;I'll send her to you in
pieces." She wheeled on the subdued and frightened company. "Get
out of here, you swine&mdash;all of you!" Then she strode to the
head of the table and seized Phoros by an ear. "And you come with
me&mdash;<i>king</i>!" The title bristled with contumely.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22">XXII. &mdash; MENOFRA</a></h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN left the window and walked along the side
of the building, looking up at the second floor. There, he
surmised, would be the sleeping chambers. In some room above,
doubtless, Gonfala was confined. Several vines clambered up the
wall. He tested them, trying to find one that might bear his
weight; and at last he came to some old ivy that had a stem that
was as large around as his arm, a gnarled old plant that clung to
the rough wall with a million aerial roots. He tried it with his
weight; then, satisfied that it would bear him, he started to
ascend toward a window directly above.</p>

<p>Close beside the open window he paused and listened, his
sensitive nostrils classifying the odors that came from the
chamber. A man slept within. Heavy breathing told him the man was
asleep. Its stertorousness and odor told him that the fellow was
drunk. Tarzan threw a leg across the sill and stepped into the
room. He moved noiselessly, feeling his way through the darkness.
He took his time, and gradually his eyes became accustomed to the
blackness of the interior. He had the gift, that some men have in
common with nocturnal animals, of being able to see in the dark
better than other men. Perhaps it had been developed to a higher
state of efficiency by necessity. One who can see by night in the
jungle has a better chance of survival.</p>

<p>Soon he identified a darker mass on the floor near a side wall
as the sleeper. That, however, was not difficult; the man's
snores screamed his location. Tarzan crossed to the opposite end
of the room and found a door. His fingers searched for lock or
bolt and found the latter. It squeaked a little as he drew it
back; but he had no fear that it would arouse the man, nor did
it. The door opened into a dimly lighted corridor&mdash;an arched
corridor along which were other doors and the arched openings
into other corridors.</p>

<p>Tarzan heard voices. They were raised in angry altercation,
and there were sounds of scuffling. The voices were those of
Menofra and Phoros. Presently there was a loud scream followed by
a thud as of a body falling; then silence. Tarzan waited,
listening. He heard a door open farther up the corridor in the
direction from which the voices had come; then he stepped back
into the room behind him, leaving the door slightly ajar so that
he could look out into the corridor. He saw a man step from a
doorway and approach along the corridor. It was Phoros. He was
staggering a little, and in his right hand he carried a bloody
short-sword. His expression was bleary-eyed and vacuous. He
passed the door from which Tarzan watched and turned into another
corridor; then the ape-man stepped into the passageway and
followed him.</p>

<p>When he reached the head of the corridor into which Phoros had
turned, Tarzan saw the Athnean fumbling with a key at the lock of
a door only a short distance ahead; and he waited until Phoros
had unlocked the door and entered the room beyond; then the ape-
man followed at a run. He wished to reach the door before Phoros
could lock it from within, if such were his intention; but it was
not. In fact, in his drunken carelessness, he did not even close
the door tightly; and he had little more than entered the room
when Tarzan pushed the door open and followed him.</p>

<p>The ape-man had moved with utter silence; so that though he
stood just behind Phoros the latter was unaware of his presence.
The room was lighted by a single cresset&mdash;a wick burning in
a shallow vessel half filled with fat. Lying in one corner of the
room, bound hand and foot, was Gonfala; in another corner,
similarly trussed, was Stanley Wood. They both saw and recognized
Tarzan simultaneously, but he raised a finger to his lips to
caution them to silence. Phoros stood leering at his two
prisoners, his gross body swaying unsteadily.</p>

<p>"So the lovers are still here," he taunted. "But why do they
stay so far apart? Here, you stupid fool, watch me; I'll show you
how to make love to the girl. She's mine now. Menofra, the old
Hellcat, is dead. Look at this sword! See the blood? That's
Menofra's blood. I just killed her." He pointed the sword at
Wood. "And just as soon as I've shown you how a lover should
behave I'm going to kill you."</p>

<p>He took a step toward Gonfala, and as he did so steel thewed
fingers gripped his sword wrist, the weapon was torn from his
hand, and he was thrown heavily to the floor.</p>

<p>"Quiet, or I kill," a low voice whispered.</p>

<p>Phoros looked into the cold grey eyes of an almost naked giant
who stood above him with his own sword pointed at his breast.
"Who are you?" he quavered. "Don't kill me. Tell me what you
want. You can have anything if you'll not kill me."</p>

<p>"I'll take what I want. Don't move." Tarzan crossed to Wood
and cut the bonds that held him. "Release Gonfala," he said, "and
when you have done that bind this man and gag him."</p>

<p>Wood worked quickly. "How did you get here?" Tarzan asked
him.</p>

<p>"I was searching for Gonfala. I followed her trail to this
city; then they took me prisoner. Today Phoros sent for me. In
some way, probably through some of his people overhearing Spike
and Troll, he got the idea that I knew how to work the Gonfal.
Spike had been bragging about its powers, but neither he nor
Troll had been able to do anything with it. They had also told
some one that Gonfala was the goddess of the big stone, and so he
brought us together and told us to show him some magic. Our
meeting was so sudden and unexpected that we gave ourselves
away&mdash;it must have been apparent to any one that we were in
love. Anyway, Phoros got it; maybe because he was jealous. He has
been trying to make love to Gonfala ever since she was captured,
but he was too scared of his wife to go very far with it."</p>

<p>When Gonfala was liberated Wood trussed up Phoros, and as he
was completing the work they heard the sound of shuffling
footsteps in the corridor. They all stood, tense and silent,
waiting. Would the footsteps pass the door, or was some one
coming to this room? Nearer and nearer they came; then they
paused outside, as though he who walked was listening. The door
was pushed open, revealing a horrible apparition. Gonfala muffled
a scream; Wood recoiled; only Tarzan showed no emotion. It was
Menofra. A horrible wound gashed her head and one shoulder. She
was covered with blood; and reeled with weakness from the loss of
it, but she still retained her wits.</p>

<p>Stepping quickly back into the corridor, she closed the door
and turned the key that the drunken Phoros had left in the lock;
then they heard her crying loudly for the guard.</p>

<p>"We seem to be nicely trapped," commented Wood.</p>

<p>"But we have a hostage," Tarzan reminded him.</p>

<p>"What a horrible sight," said Gonfala, shuddering and nodding
in the direction of the corridor. "How do you suppose it
happened?"</p>

<p>The ape-man jerked a thumb in the direction of Phoros. "He
could tell you. I imagine that he's rather glad that we were here
with him."</p>

<p>"What a sweet couple," said Wood, "but I imagine there are a
lot of married couples who would like to do that to one another
if they thought they could get away with it."</p>

<p>"What a terrible thing to say, Stanlee," cried Gonfala. "Do
you think that we would be like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we're different," Wood assured her; "these people are
beasts."</p>

<p>"Not beasts," Tarzan corrected. "They are human beings, and
they act like human beings."</p>

<p>"Here comes the guard," said Wood.</p>

<p>They could hear men approaching at a run along the corridor;
they heard their exclamations when they saw Menofra and their
excited questioning.</p>

<p>"There is a wild man in there," Menofra told them. "He has set
the two prisoners free, and they have bound and gagged the king.
They may kill him. I don't want them to; I want him for myself.
Go in and capture the strangers and bring the king to me."</p>

<p>Tarzan stood close to the door. "If you come in without my
permission," he shouted, "I will kill the king."</p>

<p>"It looks like you were on a spot, Phoros," said Wood, "no
matter what happens. If Menofra gets you she'll hand you plenty."
Phoros could make no reply because of the gag.</p>

<p>The warriors and the queen were arguing in the corridor. They
could come to no decision as to what to do. The three prisoners
in the room were no better off. Tarzan was puzzled. He told Wood
as much.</p>

<p>"I knew an Athnean noble well," he said, "and through him I
was led to believe that these people were rather noble and
chivalrous, not at all like those I have seen here. There was a
rumor in Cathne that there had been some change in government
here, but the natural assumption was that another faction of the
nobility had come into power. If these people are of the
nobility, our friend Spike must be at least an archbishop."</p>

<p>"They are not of the nobility," said Wood. "They are from the
lowest dregs of society. They overthrew the king and the nobility
a few months ago. I guess they are pretty well ruining the
country."</p>

<p>"That accounts for it," said Tarzan. "Well, I guess my friend,
Valthor, can't help me much."</p>

<p>"Valthor?" exclaimed Wood. "Do you know him? Why say, he's the
only friend I have here."</p>

<p>"Where is he? He'll help us," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Not where he is, he won't. He and I were fellow slaves at the
elephant stables."</p>

<p>"Valthor a slave!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and lucky to be that," Wood assured him. "They killed
off all the other members of the nobility they
caught&mdash;except a few that joined 'em. The rest escaped into
the mountains. Every one liked Valthor so much that they didn't
kill him."</p>

<p>"It is a good thing that I didn't take any chances when I came
here," remarked the ape-man. "They'd heard these rumors in
Cathne; so I came in after dark to investigate before I tried to
find Valthor or made myself known."</p>

<p>There was a rap on the door. "What do you want?" asked
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Turn the king over to the queen and we won't harm you," said
a voice.</p>

<p>Phoros commenced to wriggle and squirm on the floor, shaking
his head vigorously. Tarzan grinned.</p>

<p>"Wait until we talk it over," he said; then, to Wood, "Take
the gag out of his mouth."</p>

<p>As soon as the gag was removed Phoros choked and spluttered
before he could articulate an understandable word, so frightened
and excited was he. "Don't let her have me," he finally managed
to say. "She'll kill me."</p>

<p>"I think you have it coming to you," said Wood.</p>

<p>"Maybe we can reach a bargain," suggested Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Anything, anything you want," cried Phoros.</p>

<p>"Our freedom and a safe escort to The Pass of the Warriors,"
demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"It is yours," promised Phoros.</p>

<p>"And the big diamond," added Wood.</p>

<p>"And the big diamond," agreed Phoros.</p>

<p>"How do we know you'll do as you agree?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You have my word for it," Phoros assured him.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's worth much. I'd have to have something
more."</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"We'd want to take you with us and keep you close to me where
I could kill you if the bargain were not kept."</p>

<p>"That too. I agree to everything, only don't let her get her
hands on me."</p>

<p>"There is one more thing," added Tarzan. "Valthor's
freedom."</p>

<p>"Granted."</p>

<p>"And now that you've got all that arranged," said Wood, "how
in Hell are we going to get out of here with that old virago
holding the fort with the guard out there? Have you ever been to
a coronation, Tarzan?"</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well, take Phorsie out there, my friend, and you'll see a king crowned."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about, but I don't intend
taking him out of here until I have some assurance that his
promises will be carried out." He turned to Phoros. "What can you
suggest? Will the guard obey you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. They're afraid of her. Everybody's afraid of
her, and Dyaus knows they have reason."</p>

<p>"We seem to be getting nowhere with great facility," commented
Wood.</p>

<p>Tarzan crossed to Phoros and removed his bonds. "Come to the
door," he directed, "and explain my proposition to your
wife."</p>

<p>Phoros approached the door. "Listen, dear," he said
ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>"Listen nothing, you beast, you murderer," she screamed back
at him. "Just let me get my hands on you&mdash;that's all I
ask."</p>

<p>"But darling, I was drunk. I didn't mean to do it. Listen to
reason. Let me take these people out of the country with an
escort of warriors and they won't kill me."</p>

<p>"Don't 'darling' me, you, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, my own little Menofra, listen to reason. Send for
Kandos, and let us all talk it over."</p>

<p>"Go in there, you cowards, and drag them out," Menofra shouted
to the guardsmen.</p>

<p>"Stay out there!" screamed Phoros. "I am king. Those are the
king's commands."</p>

<p>"I'm queen," yelled Menofra. "I tell you to go in and rescue
the king."</p>

<p>"I'm all right," shouted Phoros. "I don't want to be
rescued."</p>

<p>"I think," said the officer of the guard, "that the best thing
to do is summon Kandos. This is no matter for a simple officer of
the guard to decide."</p>

<p>"That's right," encouraged the king; "send for Kandos."</p>

<p>They heard the officer dispatch a warrior to summon Kandos,
and they heard the queen grumbling and scolding and
threatening.</p>

<p>Wood stepped to the door. "Menofra!" he called. "I have an
idea that perhaps you hadn't thought of. Let Phoros accompany us
to the border; then when he comes back you'll have him. That will
save a lot of trouble for all concerned."</p>

<p>Phoros looked troubled. He hadn't thought of that either.
Menofra did not answer immediately; then she said, "He might
trick me in some way."</p>

<p>"How can he trick you?" demanded Wood.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but he'd find a way. He has been tricking
people all his life."</p>

<p>"He couldn't. You'd have the army. What could he do?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it's worth thinking about," admitted the queen;
"but I don't know that I could wait. I'd like to get my hands on
him right now. Did you see what he did to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was terrible," sympathized Wood.</p>

<p>It was not long before the warrior returned with Kandos.
Menofra greeted him with a volley of vituperation as soon as he
came in sight, and it was some time before he could quiet her and
get the story. Then he led her away where none could overhear,
and they whispered together for sometime. When they had finished,
Kandos approached the door.</p>

<p>"It is all arranged," he announced. "The queen has given her
permission. The party will start shortly after sunrise. It is
still dark, and the trail is not safe by night. Just as soon as
you and the escort have had your breakfasts you may go in peace.
Have we your promise that you will not harm the king."</p>

<p>"You have," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Kandos. "I am going now to arrange for the
escort."</p>

<p>"And don't forget our breakfasts!" called Wood.</p>

<p>"I most certainly will not," promised Kandos.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23">XXIII. &mdash;
SENTENCED</a></h2>

<p class="first">STANLEY WOOD was in high spirits. "It commences
to look as though our troubles were about over," he said. He laid
a hand on Gonfala's tenderly. "You've been through a lot, but I
can promise you that when we get to civilization you'll be able
to understand for the first time in your life what perfect peace
and security mean."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan, "the perfect peace and security of
automobile accidents, railroad wrecks, aeroplane crashes,
robbers, kidnapers, war, and pestilence."</p>

<p>Wood laughed. "But no lions, leopards, buffaloes, wild
elephants, snakes, nor tsetse flies, not to mention shiftas and
cannibals."</p>

<p>"I think," said Gonfala, "that neither one of you paints a
very pretty picture. You make one almost afraid of life. But
after all it is not so much peace and security that I want as
freedom. You know, all my life I have been a prisoner except for
the few short weeks after you took me away from the Kaji and
before Spike and Troll got me. Perhaps you can imagine then how
much I want freedom, no matter how many dangers I have to take
along with it. It seems the most wonderful thing in the
world."</p>

<p>"It is," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Well, love has its points, too," suggested Wood.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Gonfala, "but not without freedom."</p>

<p>"You're going to have them both," Wood promised.</p>

<p>"With limitations, you'll find, Gonfala," warned Tarzan with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Just now I'm interested in food," said Gonfala.</p>

<p>"And I think it's coming." Wood nodded toward the door. Some
one was fumbling with the key. Presently the door opened far
enough to permit two pots to be shoved inside the room; then it
was closed with a bang.</p>

<p>"They are taking no chances," commented Wood as he crossed the
room and carried the two vessels back to his companions. One
contained a thick stew; the other, water.</p>

<p>"What, no hardware?" inquired Wood.</p>

<p>"Hardware? What is that?" asked Gonfala; "something to
eat?"</p>

<p>"Something to eat with&mdash;forks, spoons. No forks, no
spoons, no Emily Post&mdash;how embarrassing!"</p>

<p>"Here," said Tarzan, and handed his hunting knife to Gonfala.
They took turns spearing morsels of meat with it and drinking the
juice and the water directly from the pots, sharing the food with
Phoros.</p>

<p>"Not half bad," commented Wood. "What is it, Phoros?"</p>

<p>"Young wether. There is nothing tastier. I am surprised that
Menofra did not send us old elephant hide to chew on. Perhaps she
is relenting." Then he shook his head. "No, Menofra never
relents&mdash;at least not where I am concerned. That woman is so
ornery she thinks indigestion is an indulgence."</p>

<p>"My!" said Gonfala, drowsily. "I am so sleepy I can't keep my
eyes open."</p>

<p>"Same here," said Wood.</p>

<p>Phoros looked at the others and yawned. Tarzan stood up and
shook himself.</p>

<p>"You, too?" asked Phoros.</p>

<p>The ape-man nodded. Phoros' lids drooped. "The old she-devil,"
he muttered. "We've all been drugged&mdash;maybe poisoned."</p>

<p>Tarzan watched his companions fall into a stupor one by one.
He tried to fight off the effects of the drug. He wondered if any
of them would awaken again; then he sagged to one knee and rolled
over on the floor, unconscious.</p>

<p><br>
THE room was decorated with barbaric splendor. Mounted
heads of animals and men adorned the walls. There were crude
murals done in colors that had faded into softness, refined by
age. Skins of animals and rugs of wool covered the floor, the
benches, and a couch on which Menofra lay, her body raised on one
elbow, her bandaged head supported by one huge palm. Four
warriors stood by the only door; at Menofra's feet lay Gonfala
and Wood, still unconscious; at her side stood Kandos; at the
foot of the couch, bound and unconscious, lay Phoros.</p>

<p>"You sent the wild-man to the slave pen as I directed?" asked
Menofra.</p>

<p>Kandos nodded. "Yes, queen; and because he seemed so strong I
had him chained to a stanchion."</p>

<p>"That is well," said Menofra. "Even a fool does the right
thing occasionally."</p>

<p>"Thank you, queen," said Kandos.</p>

<p>"Don't thank me; you make me sick. You are a liar and a cheat
and a traitor. Phoros befriended you, yet you turned against him.
How much more quickly would you turn against me who has never
befriended you and whom you hate! But you won't, because you are
a coward; and don't even think of it. If I ever get the idea for
a moment that you might be thinking of turning against me I'll
have your head hanging on this wall in no time. The man is coming
to."</p>

<p>They looked down at Wood whose eyes were opening slowly and
whose arms and legs were moving a little as though experimenting
with the possibilities of self-control. He was the first to
regain consciousness. He opened his eyes and looked about him. He
saw Gonfala lying beside him. Her rising and falling bosom
assured him that she lived. He looked up at Kandos and the
queen.</p>

<p>"So this is the way you keep your word?" he accused; then he
looked about for Tarzan. "Where is the other?"</p>

<p>"He is quite safe," said Kandos. "The queen in her mercy has
not killed any of you."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with us?" demanded Wood.</p>

<p>"The wild-man goes to the arena," replied Menofra. "You and
the girl will not be killed immediately&mdash;not until you have
served my purpose."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"You shall know presently. Kandos, send for a priest; Phoros
will soon awaken."</p>

<p>Gonfala opened her eyes and sat up. "What has happened?" she
asked. "Where are we?"</p>

<p>"We are still prisoners," Wood told her. "These people have
double-crossed us."</p>

<p>"Civilization seems very far away," she said and tears came to
her eyes.</p>

<p>He took her hand. "You must be brave, dear."</p>

<p>"I am tired of being brave; I have been brave for so long. I
should like so much to cry, Stanlee."</p>

<p>Now Phoros regained consciousness, and looked first at one and
then at another. When his eyes fell on Menofra he winced.</p>

<p>"Ah, the rat has awakened," said the queen.</p>

<p>"You have rescued me, my dear!" said Phoros.</p>

<p>"You may call it that, if you wish," said Menofra coldly; "but
I should call it by another name, as you will later."</p>

<p>"Now, my darling, let us forget the past&mdash;let bygones be
bygones. Kandos, remove my bonds. How does it look to see the
king trussed up like this?"</p>

<p>"It looks all right to me," Menofra assured him, "but how
would you like to be trussed up? It could be done with red hot
chains, you know. In fact, it has been done. It's not a bad idea;
I am glad you suggested it."</p>

<p>"But, Menofra, my dear wife, you wouldn't do that to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you think not? But you would try to kill me with your
sword so that you could take this wench here to wife. Well, I'm
not going to have you trussed up with red hot chains&mdash;not
yet. First I am going to remove temptation from your path without
removing the object of your temptation. I am going to let you see
what you might have enjoyed."</p>

<p>There was a rap on the door, and one of the warriors said,
"The priest is here."</p>

<p>"Let him in," ordered Menofra.</p>

<p>Wood had helped Gonfala to her feet, and the two were seated
on a bench, mystified listeners to Menofra's cryptic speech. When
the priest had entered the room and bowed before the queen she
pointed to them.</p>

<p>"Marry these two," she commanded.</p>

<p>Wood and Gonfala looked at one another in astonishment.
"There's a catch in this somewhere," said the former. "The old
termagant's not doing this because she loves us, but I'm not
looking any gift horse in the mouth."</p>

<p>"It's what we've been waiting and hoping for," said Gonfala,
"but I wish it could have happened under different conditions.
There is something sinister in this. I don't believe that any
good thought could come out of that woman's mind."</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony was extremely simple, but very
impressive. It laid upon the couple the strictest obligations of
fidelity and condemned to death and damned through eternity
whomever might cause either to be unfaithful to the other.</p>

<p>During the ceremony Menofra wore a sardonic smile, while
Phoros had difficulty in hiding his chagrin and anger. When it
was concluded, the queen turned to her mate. "You know the laws
of our people," she said. "King or commoner, whoever comes
between these two must die. You know that don't you, Phoros? You
know you've lost her, don't you&mdash;forever? You would try to
kill me, would you? Well, I'm going to let you live&mdash;I'm
going to let you live with this wench; but watch your step,
Phoros; for I'll be watching you." She turned to the guard. "Now
take them away. Take this man to the slave pen, and see that
nothing happens to him, and take Phoros and the wench to the room
next to mine; and lock them in."</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Tarzan regained consciousness he found himself chained to
a stanchion in a stockaded compound, an iron collar around his
neck. He was quite alone; but pallets of musty grass, odd bits of
dirty clothing, cooking utensils, and the remains of cooking
fires, still smoldering, disclosed the fact that the shed and the
yard was the abode of others; and he conjectured correctly that
he had been imprisoned in a slave pen.</p>

<p>The position of the sun told him that he had been under the
influence of the drug for about an hour. The effects were passing
off rapidly leaving only a dull headache and a feeling of chagrin
that he had been so easily duped. He was concerned about the fate
of Wood and Gonfala, and was at a loss to understand why he had
been separated from them. His active mind was occupied with this
problem and that of escape when the gate of the compound opened
and Wood was brought in by an escort of warriors who merely
shoved the American through the gateway and departed after
relocking the gate.</p>

<p>Wood crossed the compound to Tarzan. "I wondered what they had
done with you," he said. "I was afraid they might have killed
you." Then he told the ape-man what Menofra had decreed for
Gonfala. "It is monstrous, Tarzan; the woman is a beast. What are
we to do?"</p>

<p>Tarzan tapped the iron collar that encircled his neck. "There
is not much that I can do," he said ruefully.</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose they've chained you up and not me?" asked
Wood.</p>

<p>"They must have some special form of entertainment in view for
me," suggested the ape-man with a faint smile.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day passed in desultory conversation,
principally a monologue; as Tarzan was not given to garrulity.
Wood talked to keep from thinking about Gonfala's situation, but
he was not very successful. Late in the afternoon the slaves were
returned to the compound, and immediately crowded around Tarzan.
One of them pushed his way to the front when he caught a glimpse
of the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Tarzan!" he exclaimed. "It is really you?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is, Valthor," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"And you are back, I see," said Valthor to Wood. "I did not
expect to see you again. What happened?"</p>

<p>Wood told him the whole story of their misadventure, and
Valthor looked grave. "Your friend, Gonfala, may be safe as long
as Menofra lives; but she may not live long. Kandos will see to
that if he is not too big a coward; then, with Menofra out of the
way, Phoros will again come to power. When he does, he will
destroy you. After that there would not be much hope for Gonfala.
The situation is serious, and I can see no way out unless the
king and his party were to return and recapture the city. I
believe they could do it now, for practically all of the citizens
and most of the warriors are sick of Phoros and the rest of the
Erythra."</p>

<p>A tall black came close to Tarzan. "You do not remember me,
master?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; of course I do," replied the ape-man. "You're
Gemba. You were a slave in the house of Thudos at Cathne. How
long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Many moons, master. I was taken in a raid. The work is hard,
and often these new masters are cruel. I wish that I were back in
Cathne."</p>

<p>"You would fare well there now, Gemba. Your old master is king
of Cathne. I think that if he knew Tarzan was a prisoner here, he
would come and make war on Athne."</p>

<p>"And I think that if he did," said Valthor, "an army from
Cathne would be welcome here for the first time in history; but
there is no chance that he will come, for there is no way in
which he may learn that Tarzan is here."</p>

<p>"If I could get this collar off my neck," said the ape-man, "I
could soon get out of this slave pen and the city and bring
Thudos with his army. He would come for me to save my
friends."</p>

<p>"But you can't get it off," said Wood.</p>

<p>"You are right," agreed Tarzan; "it is idle talk."</p>

<p>For several days nothing occurred to break the monotony of
existence in the slave pen of the king of Athne. No word reached
them from the palace of what was transpiring there; no inkling
came of the fate that was in store for them. Valthor had told
Tarzan that the latter was probably being saved for the arena on
account of his appearance of great strength, but when there would
be games again he did not know. The new masters of Athne had
changed everything, deriding all that had been sacred to custom
and the old regime. There was even talk of changing the name of
Athne to The City of Phoros. All that prevented was the
insistence of the queen that it be renamed The City of
Menofra.</p>

<p>Every morning the slaves were taken to work, and all day long
Tarzan remained alone, chained like a wild animal. Imprisonment
of any nature galled The Lord of the Jungle; to be chained was
torture. Yet he gave no sign of the mental suffering he was
enduring. To watch him, one might have thought that he was
content. Seething beneath that calm exterior was a raging sea of
anger.</p>

<p>One afternoon the slaves were returned to the pen earlier than
usual. The guards that herded them in were unusually rough with
them, and there were several officers not ordinarily present.
They followed the slaves into the pen and counted them, checking
off their names on a scroll carried by one of the officers; then
they questioned them; and from the questions Tarzan gathered that
there had been a concerted attempt on the part of a number of
slaves to escape, during which a guard had been killed. During
the excitement of the melee several slaves had escaped into the
bamboo forest that grew close upon the eastern boundary of the
cultivated fields of Athne. The check revealed that three were
missing. Were they ever recaptured, they would be tortured and
killed.</p>

<p>The officers and warriors were extremely brutal in their
handling of the slaves as they questioned them, trying to force
confessions from them that they might ascertain just how far-
reaching the plot had been and which slaves were the ring-
leaders. After they left the pen the slaves were in a turmoil of
restlessness and discontent. The air was surcharged with the
static electricity of repressed rebellion that the slightest
spark would have ignited, but Valthor counselled them to
patience.</p>

<p>"You will only subject yourselves to torture and death," he
told them. "We are only a handful of unarmed slaves. What can we
do against the armed warriors of the Erythra? Wait. As sure as
Dyaus is in heaven some change must come. There is as much
discontent outside the slave pen as within it; and one day Zygo,
our king, will come out of the mountains where he is hiding and
set us free."</p>

<p>"But some of us are slaves no matter who is king," said one.
"I am. It would make no difference whether Zygo or Phoros were
king&mdash;I should still be a slave."</p>

<p>"No," said Valthor. "I can promise you all that when Zygo
comes into power again you will all be set free. I give you my
word that it will be done."</p>

<p>"Well," said one, "I might not believe another, but all know
that what the noble Valthor says he will do, he will do."</p>

<p>It was almost dark now, and the cooking fires were alight, and
the slaves were cooking their poor meals in little pots. Jerked
elephant meat constituted the larger part of their diet; to this
was added a very coarse variety of turnip. From the two the men
made a stew. Sometimes those who worked in the fields varied this
diet with other vegetables they had been able to steal from the
fields and smuggle into the pen.</p>

<p>"This stew," remarked Wood, "should be full of vitamins; it
has everything else including elephant hair and pebbles. The
elephant hair and the pebbles might be forgiven, but turnips! In
the economy of mundane happiness there is no place for the
turnip."</p>

<p>"I take it that you don't like turnips," said Valthor.</p>

<p><br>
SINCE Tarzan had been brought to the slave pen, Troll and
Spike had kept to themselves. Spike was very much afraid of the
ape-man; and he had managed to impart this fear to Troll,
although the latter had forgotten that there was any reason to
fear him. Spike was worried for fear that, in the event they were
liberated, Tarzan would find some way to keep the great diamond
from him. This did not trouble Troll who had forgotten all about
the diamond. The only thing that Troll remembered clearly was
that Gonfala was his sister and that he had lost her. This
worried him a great deal, and he talked about it continually.
Spike encouraged him in the delusion and never referred to the
diamond, although it was constantly the subject of his thoughts
and plannings. His principal hope of retrieving it lay in the
possibility that the rightful king of Athne would regain his
throne, treat him as a guest instead of a prisoner, and return
the Gonfal to him; and he knew from conversations he had had with
other prisoners that the return of Zygo was just between a
possibility and a probability.</p>

<p>As the slaves were eating their evening meal and discussing
the escape of their three fellows an officer entered the compound
with a detail of warriors, one of whom carried an iron collar and
chain. Approaching the shed, the officer called Valthor.</p>

<p>"I am here," said the noble, rising.</p>

<p>"I have a present for you, aristocrat," announced the officer,
who until the revolution had been a groom in the elephant stables
of Zygo.</p>

<p>"So I see," replied Valthor, glancing at the collar and chain,
"and one which it must give a stable-boy much pleasure to bring
me."</p>

<p>The officer flushed angrily. "Be careful, or I'll teach you
some manners," he growled. "You are the stable-boy now, and I am
the aristocrat."</p>

<p>Valthor shook his head. "No, stable-boy, you are wrong. You
will always be a stable-boy at heart, and way down deep inside
you, you know it. That is what makes you angry. That is what
makes you hate me, or think that you hate me; you really hate
yourself, because you know that you will always be a stable-boy
no matter what Phoros tells you you are. He has done many strange
things since he drove out the king, but he cannot make a lion out
of a jackal's tail."</p>

<p>"Enough of this," snapped the officer. "Here, you, snap the
collar about his neck and chain him to the stanchion beside the
wild-man."</p>

<p>"Why has Phoros thus honored me?" inquired Valthor.</p>

<p>"It was not Phoros; it was Menofra. She is ruling now."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," said the noble. "Her psychology of hate for my
class is more deeply rooted than yours, for it springs from
filthy soil. Your vocation was at least honorable. Menofra was a
woman of the street before Phoros married her."</p>

<p>"Well, have your say while you can, aristocrat," said the
officer, tauntingly, "for tomorrow you and the wild-man die in
the arena, trampled and gored by a rogue elephant."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; DEATH</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE other slaves were furious because of the
sentence imposed upon Valthor, who was to die, the officer had
told him before he left, in punishment for the outbreak that had
resulted in the death of an Erythros warrior and the escape of
three slaves and as a warning to the others. Valthor had been
chosen ostensibly not because he had been charged with fomenting
rebellion among the slaves, but really because he was popular
among them and an aristocrat.</p>

<p>Wood was horrified by the knowledge that Tarzan was to die,
Tarzan and Valthor, both of whom were his friends. It seemed to
him absolutely inconceivable that the mighty heart of the Lord of
the Jungle should be stilled forever, that that perfect body
should be broken and trampled in the dust of an arena to satisfy
the blood lust of ignorant barbarians.</p>

<p>"There must be something that we can do," he said; "there's
got to be. Couldn't we break those chains?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "I have examined mine carefully," he
said, "and tested it. If it were cast iron, we might break a
link; but it is malleable and would only bend. If we had a
chisel&mdash;but we haven't. No, there is nothing to do but
wait."</p>

<p>"But they are going to kill you, Tarzan! Don't you understand?
They are going to kill you."</p>

<p>The ape-man permitted himself the shadow of a smile. "There is
nothing unique in that," he said. "Many people have died; many
people are dying; many people will die&mdash;even you, my
friend."</p>

<p>"Tarzan is right," said Valthor. "We must all die; what
matters is how we die. If we meet death courageously, as befits
warriors, there will be no regrets. For myself, I am glad that an
elephant is going to kill me; for I am an elephant-man. You know
what that means, Tarzan; for you have been to Cathne where the
lion-men are the nobles; and you know with what pride they bear
the title. It is the same here, except that the nobles are the
elephant-men. As they breed lions, we breed elephants; their god,
Thoos, is a lion; our Dyaus is an elephant. The nobles who
escaped the Erythros revolution took him into the mountains with
them, for the Erythra, who have no god, would have killed
him."</p>

<p>"If I were to have my choice of the manner in which I were to
die," said Tarzan, "I should prefer the lion to the elephant. For
one thing, the lion kills quickly; but my real reason is that the
elephant has always been my friend; my very best friend, perhaps;
and I do not like to think that a friend must kill me."</p>

<p>"This one will not be your friend, Tarzan," Valthor reminded
him.</p>

<p>"No, I know it; but I was not thinking of him as an
individual," explained Tarzan. "And now, as, with all our talk,
we have arrived nowhere, I am going to sleep."</p>

<p><br>
THE morning of their death dawned like any other morning.
Neither spoke of what was impending. With Wood they cooked their
breakfasts, and they talked, and Valthor laughed, and
occasionally Tarzan smiled one of his rare smiles. Wood was the
most nervous. When the time came for the slaves to be taken to
their work he came to say goodbye to the ape-man.</p>

<p>Tarzan laid a hand upon his shoulder. "I do not like to say
good-bye, my friend," he said.</p>

<p>If Wood had known how rare was the use by Tarzan of that term
"my friend" he would have been honored. He thought of many
animals as friends, but few men. He liked Wood, his intelligence,
his courage, his cleanness.</p>

<p>"Have you no message you would like to send
to&mdash;to&mdash;" Wood hesitated.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "Thank you, no," he said. "She will
know, as she always has."</p>

<p>Wood turned and walked away, following the other slaves out of
the stockade. He stumbled over the threshold, and swore under his
breath as he drew a palm across his eyes.</p>

<p>It was afternoon before they came for Tarzan and Valthor, half
a hundred warriors and several officers, all in their best
trappings, their freshly burnished arms shining in the sun.</p>

<p>In front of the palace a procession was forming. There were
many elephants richly caparisoned and bearing howdahs in which
rode the new-made nobility of Athne. All the howdahs were open
except one elaborate pavilion. In this sat Menofra alone. When
Valthor saw her he laughed aloud. Tarzan turned and looked at him
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Look at her!" exclaimed the noble. "She could not be more
self-conscious if she were naked. In fact that would not bother
her so much. The poor thing is trying to look the queen. Note the
haughty mien, and the crown! Dyaus! she is wearing the crown to
the arena&mdash;and wearing it backwards. It is worth dying to
see."</p>

<p>Valthor had not attempted to lower his voice. In fact it
seemed that he raised it a little. His laughter had attracted
attention to him, so that many listened and heard his words. They
even reached the ears of Menofra. That was apparent to all who
could see her, for her face turned fiery red; and she took the
crown off and placed it on the seat beside her. She was so
furious that she trembled; and when she gave the command to
march, as she immediately did, her voice shook with rage.</p>

<p>With the hundred elephants in single file, the many warriors
on foot, the banners and pennons, the procession was colorful;
but it lacked that something that would have made its
magnificence impressive. There was nothing real about its assumed
majesty, and the entire pageant was colored by the spuriousnesss
of its principal actors. This was the impression that it made
upon the Lord of the Jungle walking in chains behind the elephant
of Menofra.</p>

<p>The procession followed the main avenue to the south gate
through lines of silent citizens. There was no cheering, no
applause. There were whispered comments as Valthor and Tarzan
passed; and it was plain to see that the sympathies of the people
were with Valthor, though they dared not express them openly.
Tarzan was a stranger to them; their only interest in him lay in
the fact that he might serve to give them a few minutes of
thrills and entertainment in the arena.</p>

<p>Passing through the gate, the column turned toward the east,
coming at last to the arena, which lay directly east of the city.
Just outside the main gate, through which the procession entered
the arena, Tarzan and Valthor were led from the line of march and
taken to a smaller gate which led through a high palisade of
small logs into a paddock between two sections of a grandstand.
The inner end of the paddock was formed by a palisade of small
logs; and was similar to the outer end, having a small gate
opening onto the arena. The ape-man could not but notice the
flimsy construction of the two palisades, and idly wondered if
the entire arena were as poorly built.</p>

<p>In the compound there were a number of armed guards; and
presently other prisoners were brought, men whom Tarzan had not
before seen. They had been brought from the city behind the
elephants of lesser dignitaries who had ridden in the rear of
Menofra. Several of these prisoners, who spoke to Valthor, were
evidently men of distinction.</p>

<p>"We are about the last of the aristocracy who did not escape
or go over to the Erythra," Valthor explained to Tarzan. "Phoros
and Menofra think that by killing off all their enemies they will
have no opposition and nothing more to fear; but as a matter of
fact they are only making more enemies, for the middle classes
were naturally more in sympathy with the aristocracy than with
the scum which constitutes the Erythra."</p>

<p>About four feet from the top of the inner palisade was a
horizontal beam supporting the ends of braces that held the
palisade upright, and upon this beam the prisoners were allowed
to stand and witness what took place in the arena until it was
their turn to enter. When Tarzan and Valthor took their places on
the beam the royal pageant had just completed a circuit of the
arena, and Menofra was clumsily descending from the howdah of her
elephant to enter the royal loge. The grandstands were about half
filled, and crowds were still pouring through the tunnels. There
was little noise other than the shuffling of sandaled feet and
the occasional trumpeting of an elephant. It did not seem to
Tarzan a happy, carefree throng out to enjoy a holiday; but
rather a sullen mob suppressed by fear. A laugh would have been
as startling as a scream.</p>

<p>The first encounter was between two men; one a huge Erythros
warrior armed with sword and spear; the other a former noble
whose only weapon was a dagger. It was an execution, not a
duel&mdash;an execution preceded by torture. The audience watched
it, for the most part, in silence. There were a few shouts of
encouragement from the loges of the officials and the new
nobility.</p>

<p>Valthor and Tarzan watched with disgust. "I think he could
have killed that big fellow," said the ape-man. "I saw how he
might be easily handled. It is too bad that the other did not
think of it."</p>

<p>"You think you could kill Hyark?" demanded a guard standing
next to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the ape-man. "He is clumsy and stupid; most
of all he is a coward."</p>

<p>"Hyark a coward? That is a good one. There are few braver
among the Erythra."</p>

<p>"I can believe that," said Tarzan, and Valthor laughed.</p>

<p>Hyark was strutting to and fro before the royal box receiving
the applause of Menofra and her entourage, slaves were dragging
out the mutilated corpse of his victim, and an officer was
approaching the paddock to summon forth the next combatants.</p>

<p>The guard called to him, "Here is one who thinks he can kill
Hyark."</p>

<p>The officer looked up. "Which one thinks that?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>The guard jerked a thumb toward Tarzan. "This wild-man here.
Perhaps Menofra would like to see such an encounter. It should
prove amusing."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the officer, "I should like to see it myself.
Maybe after the next combat. I'll ask her."</p>

<p>The next prisoner to be taken into the arena was an old man.
He was given a dagger to defend himself; then a lion was loosed
upon him.</p>

<p>"That is a very old lion," said Tarzan to Valthor. "Most of
his teeth are gone. He is weak from mange and hunger."</p>

<p>"But he will kill the man," said Valthor.</p>

<p>"Yes, he will kill the man; he is still a powerful brute."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think you could kill him, too," jeered the
guard.</p>

<p>"Probably," assented the ape-man.</p>

<p>The guard thought this very funny, and laughed
uproariously.</p>

<p>The lion made short work of the old man, giving him, at least,
a merciful death; then the officer came, after they had driven
the lion back into his cage with many spears, and said that
Menofra had given assent to the fight between Hyark and the wild-
man.</p>

<p>"She has promised to make Hyark a captain for killing two men
in one afternoon," said the officer.</p>

<p>"This one says he can kill the lion, too," screamed the guard,
rocking with laughter.</p>

<p>"But Hyark is going to kill your wild-man now; so we will
never know if he could kill the lion," said the officer,
pretending to be deeply grieved.</p>

<p>"I will fight them both at once," said Tarzan; "that is if
Hyark is not afraid to go into the arena with a lion."</p>

<p>"That would be something to see," said the officer. "I will go
at once and speak to Menofra."</p>

<p>"Why did you say that, Tarzan?" asked Valthor.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you that I'd rather be killed by a lion than an
elephant?"</p>

<p>Valthor shook his head. "Perhaps you are right. At least it
will be over sooner. This waiting is getting on my nerves."</p>

<p>Very soon the officer returned. "It is arranged," he said.</p>

<p>"What did Hyark think of it?" asked Valthor.</p>

<p>"I think he did not like the idea at all. He said he just
recalled that his wife was very ill, and asked Menofra to give
some one else the honor of killing the wild-man."</p>

<p>"And what did Menofra say?"</p>

<p>"She said that if Hyark didn't get into the arena and kill the
wild-man she would kill Hyark."</p>

<p>"Menofra has a grand sense of humor," remarked Valthor.</p>

<p>Tarzan dropped to the ground and was taken into the arena,
where the iron collar was removed from about his neck and he was
handed a dagger. He walked toward the royal box below which Hyark
was standing. Hyark came running to meet him, hoping to dispatch
him quickly and get out of the arena before the lion could be
loosed. The men at the lion's cage were having some difficulty in
raising the door. The lion, nervous and excited from his last
encounter, was roaring and growling as he struck at the bars
trying to reach the men working about him.</p>

<p>Hyark held his spear in front of him. He hoped to thrust it
through Tarzan the moment that he came within reach of him. There
would be no playing with his victim in this encounter, his sole
idea being to get it over and get out of the arena.</p>

<p>Tarzan advanced slightly crouched. He had stuck the dagger
into the cord that supported his loin cloth. The fact that he
came on with bare hands puzzled the crowd and confused Hyark, who
had long since regretted that he had accepted the challenge so
boastfully. He was not afraid of the man, of course; but the two
of them! What if the man avoided being killed until the lion was
upon them? The lion might as readily leap upon Hyark as upon the
other. It was this that added to Hyark's confusion.</p>

<p>They were close now. With an oath, Hyark lunged his spear
point at the naked breast of his antagonist; then Tarzan did just
what he had planned to do knowing as he did his own agility and
strength. He seized the haft of the spear and wrenched the weapon
from Hyark's grasp, hurling it to the ground behind him; then
Hyark reached for his sword; but he was too slow. The ape-man was
upon him; steel thewed fingers seized him and swung him
around.</p>

<p>A great shout went up from the crowd&mdash;the lion was
loosed!</p>

<p>Grasping Hyark by the collar of his jerkin and his sword belt,
the ape-man held him helpless despite his struggles. For the
first time the crowd became really vocal. They laughed, jeering
at Hyark; they screamed warnings at the wild-man, shouting that
the lion was coming; but Tarzan knew that already. From the
corner of an eye he was watching the carnivore as it came down
the length of the arena at a trot. He could get a better estimate
of the beast now as it came closer. It was a small lion, old and
pitifully emaciated. Evidently it had been starved a long time to
make it ravenous. Tarzan's anger rose against those who had been
responsible for this cruelty, and because of it there was born in
his mind a plan to avenge the lion.</p>

<p>As the lion approached, Tarzan went to meet it, pushing the
frantic Hyark ahead of him; and just before the beast launched
its lethal charge, the ape-man gave Hyark a tremendous shove
directly toward the great cat; and then Hyark did precisely what
Tarzan had anticipated he would do&mdash;he turned quickly to one
side and broke into a run. Tarzan stood still&mdash;not a muscle
moved. He was directly in the path of the lion, but the latter
did not hesitate even an instant; it turned and pursued the
fleeing Hyark, the screaming, terrified Hyark.</p>

<p>"The brave Hyark will have to run much faster if he hopes to
get his captaincy," said Valthor to the guard. "He would have
been better off had he stood still; the lion was sure to pursue
him if he ran. Had he stepped to one side and stood still, the
lion might have continued his charge straight for Tarzan. At
least he would have had a chance then, but he certainly cannot
outrun a lion."</p>

<p>Just in front of the loge of Menofra the lion overtook Hyark,
and the screaming man went down beneath the mangy body to a
mercifully quick end. Before his final struggles had ended the
starving beast commenced to devour him.</p>

<p>Tarzan came up the arena toward the royal loge and the feeding
lion. On the way he picked up Hyark's discarded spear and crept
silently onto the lion from the rear; nor did the lion, occupied
with his greedy feeding, see the approaching man. The crowd sat
tense and silent, marvelling, perhaps, at the courage of this
naked wild-man. Closer and closer to the lion crept Tarzan; and
still the lion fed upon the carcass of Hyark, unconscious of the
ape-man's presence. Directly behind the carnivore Tarzan laid the
spear upon the ground. He had brought it only as a measure of
safety in the event his plan miscarried. Then, with the swiftness
and agility of Sheeta the panther, he leaped astride the feeding
cat and grasped it by the mane and the loose hide upon its back,
lifting it bodily from its kill and at the same time swinging
around and whirling the beast with him, roaring and striking, but
futilely. It was the lightning quickness of his act that made it
possible&mdash;that and his great strength&mdash;as, with one
superhuman effort, he flung the beast into the royal loge; then,
without a single backward glance, he turned and walked back
toward the prisoners' paddock.</p>

<p>The lion's body struck Menofra and knocked her from her chair;
but the lion, frightened now and bewildered, thought for the
moment only of escape; and leaped to an adjoining loge. Here he
lashed out with his taloned paws to right and left among the
screaming nobility. From one loge to another he leaped, leaving a
trail of screaming victims, until he chanced upon a tunnel, into
which he darted and galloped to freedom beyond the
amphitheater.</p>

<p>The stands were in an uproar as the populace cheered Tarzan as
he entered the paddock and took his place again beside Valthor on
the cross-beam. The guard who had ridiculed him looked at him now
in awe, while the other prisoners praised and congratulated
him.</p>

<p>"Menofra should give you a wreath and a title," said Valthor,
"for you have given her and the people such entertainment as they
have never seen before in this arena."</p>

<p>Tarzan looked across at the royal loge and saw Menofra
standing in it apparently unhurt. "The lion missed a golden
opportunity," he said; "and as for the wreath and the title, I do
not deserve them; for it was the lion, not Menofra or the people,
that I was trying to entertain."</p>

<p>When the stands had quieted down and the wounded been removed,
the officer in charge returned to the paddock. "You were a fool,"
he said to Tarzan, "to throw the lion into Menofra's loge. If you
hadn't done that, I believe she would have given you your
liberty; but now she has ordered that you be destroyed at once.
You and Valthor go in next. You will take your places in the
center of the arena immediately."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Valthor, "that you might have had a better
reception in The City of Ivory. I wish that you might have known
my own people and they you. That you should have come here to die
is tragic, but the fates were against you."</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," said Tarzan, "at least we have seen one
another again; and&mdash;we are not dead yet."</p>

<p>"We shall be presently."</p>

<p>"I think that perhaps you are right," agreed the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are. Have you any plan?"</p>

<p>"None," replied Tarzan. "I know that I cannot throw an
elephant into Menofra's loge."</p>

<p>"Not this one," said Valthor. "I know him. I helped capture
him. He is a devil and huge. He hates men. They have been saving
him for this, and they will probably kill him afterward&mdash;he
is too dangerous."</p>

<p>"They are opening the elephant paddock," said Tarzan. "Here he
comes!"</p>

<p>A great elephant charged, trumpeting, through the opened
gates. At first he did not appear to notice the two men in the
center of the arena, and trotted around close to the stands as
though searching for an avenue of escape; then quite suddenly he
wheeled toward the center and trotted toward the two men.</p>

<p>Tarzan had noted his great size and the one tusk darker than
the other, and on the screen of memory was pictured another scene
and another day&mdash;hyenas at the edge of a pit, snapping at a
huge elephant with one dark tusk, while above circled Ska the
vulture.</p>

<p>The elephant's trunk was raised, he was trumpeting as he came
toward them; and then Tarzan stepped quickly forward and raised a
hand with the palm toward the beast.</p>

<p>"Dan-do, Tantor!" he commanded. "Tarzan yo."</p>

<p>The great beast hesitated; then he stopped. Tarzan walked
toward him, motioning Valthor to follow directly behind him, and
stopped with one hand upon the trunk that was now lowered and
feeling exploratorily over the ape-man's body.</p>

<p>"Nala Tarzan!" commanded the ape-man. "Nala tarmangani!" and
he pulled Valthor to his side.</p>

<p>The elephant raised his trunk and trumpeted loudly; then he
gathered first one and then the other in its folds and lifted
them to his head. For a moment he stood swaying to and fro as
Tarzan spoke to him in low tones; then, trumpeting again, he
started off at a trot around the arena while the spectators sat
in stunned amazement. The great beast had completed half the oval
and was opposite the prisoners' paddock when Tarzan gave a quick
command. The elephant wheeled sharply to the left and crossed the
arena while Tarzan urged him on with words of encouragement in
that strange mother of languages that the great apes use and the
lesser apes and the little monkeys and that is understood in
proportion to their intelligence by many another beast of the
forest and the plain.</p>

<p>With lowered head the mighty bull crashed into the flimsy
palisade at the inner end of the paddock, flattening it to the
ground; then the outer palisade fell before him; and he carried
Tarzan and Valthor out onto the plain toward freedom.</p>

<p>As they passed the main gate of the amphitheater and headed
south they saw the first contingent of their pursuers issuing
from the arena and clambering to the howdahs of the waiting
elephants, and before they had covered half a mile the pursuit
was in full cry behind them.</p>

<p>While their own mount was making good time some of the
pursuing elephants were gaining on him.</p>

<p>"Racing elephants," commented Valthor.</p>

<p>"They are carrying heavy loads," observed the ape-man: "five
and six warriors beside a heavy howdah."</p>

<p>Valthor nodded. "If we can keep ahead of them for half an hour
we've a good chance to get away." Then he turned from the
pursuers and looked ahead. "Mother of Dyaus!" he exclaimed.
"We're caught between a wild bull and a hungry lion&mdash;the
Cathneans are coming, and they're coming for war. This is no
ordinary raid. Look at them!"</p>

<p>Tarzan turned and saw a body of men that approximated an army
coming across the plain toward them, and in the van were the
fierce war lions of Cathne. He looked back. Closing in rapidly
upon them were the war elephants of Athne.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25">XXV. &mdash; BATTLE</a></h2>

<p class="first">"I THINK we yet have a chance to escape them
both," said Valthor. "Turn him toward the east. Zygo and his
loyal followers are there in the mountains."</p>

<p>"We do not have to run away from our friends," replied
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I hope they recognize you as a friend before they loose their
war lions. They are trained to leap to the backs of elephants and
kill the men riding there."</p>

<p>"Then we'll approach them on foot," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"And be caught by the Erythra," added Valthor.</p>

<p>"We shall have to take a chance but wait! Let's try
something." He spoke to the bull, and the animal came to a stop
and wheeled about; then Tarzan leaped to the ground, motioning
Valthor to follow him. He spoke a few words into the ear of the
elephant, and stepped aside. Up went the great trunk, forward the
huge ears; as the mighty beast started back to meet the oncoming
elephants.</p>

<p>"I think he'll hold them up long enough for us to reach the
Cathnean line before they can overtake us," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>The two men turned then and started toward the advancing horde
of warriors&mdash;toward ranks of gleaming spears and golden
helmets and the lions of war on golden chains. Suddenly a warrior
left the ranks and ran forward to meet them; and when he was
closer, Tarzan saw that he was an officer. It was Gemnon.</p>

<p>"I recognized you at once," he cried to the ape-man. "We were
coming to rescue you."</p>

<p>"How did you know that I was in trouble?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Gemba told us. He was a prisoner with you in the slave pen;
but he escaped, and came straight to Thudos with word that you
were to be killed."</p>

<p>"Two of my friends are still prisoners in Athne," said Tarzan,
"and now that you have caught many of the warriors of Phoros out
here on the plain in a disorganized condition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gemnon; "Thudos realized his advantage, and we
shall attack at once as soon as we get back to the lines."</p>

<p>Valthor and Gemnon had met before, when Valthor was a prisoner
in Cathne. Thudos the king welcomed them both, for Gemba had told
him of the Erythra; and naturally his sympathies were with the
aristocracy of Athne.</p>

<p>"If Thoos is with us today," he said, "we shall put Zygo back
upon his throne." Then, to an aide, "Loose the lions of war!"</p>

<p>The great bull with the dark tusk had met the first of the war
elephants of Athne head on with such a terrific impact that all
the warriors were hurled from the howdah and the war elephant
thrown to the ground; then he charged the next and overthrew it,
whereat the others scattered to avoid him; and a moment later the
war lions of Cathne were among them. They did not attack the
elephants, but leaped to the howdahs and mauled the warriors. Two
or three lions would attack a single elephant at a time, and at
least two of them succeeded ordinarily in reaching the
howdah.</p>

<p>The commander of the Erythros forces sought to rally his men
and form a line to repel the advance of the Cathneans; and while
he was seeking to accomplish this, the Cathnean foot warriors
were upon them, adding to the rout that the great bull had
started and the lions almost completed.</p>

<p>The Erythros warriors hurled spears at their foes and sought
to trample them beneath the feet of their mounts. The Cathneans'
first aim was to kill the mahouts and stampede the elephants and
while some warriors were attempting this, others pressed close to
the elephants in an endeavor to cut the girths with their sharp
daggers, precipitating the howdahs and their occupants to the
ground.</p>

<p>The shouts of the warriors, the trumpeting of the elephants,
the roars of the lions, and the screams of the wounded produced
an indescribable bedlam that added to the confusion of the scene
and seemed to raise the blood lust of the participants to demonic
proportions.</p>

<p>While a portion of his forces was engaging the Erythra on the
plain before the city, Thudos maneuvered the remainder to a
position between the battle and the city, cutting off the Erythra
retreat; and with this and the killing of their commander the
Athneans lost heart and scattered in all directions, leaving the
city to the mercy of the enemy.</p>

<p>Thudos led his victorious troops into Athne, and with him
marched Tarzan and Valthor. They liberated Wood and the other
prisoners in the slave pen, including Spike and Troll; and then,
at Wood's urgent pleading, marched to the palace in search of
Gonfala. They met with slight resistance, the palace guard soon
fleeing from the superior numbers that confronted them.</p>

<p>Tarzan and Wood, led by a palace slave, hurried to the
apartment where Gonfala was confined. The door, fastened by a
bolt on the outside, was quickly opened; and the two men entered
to see Gonfala standing above the body of Phoros, a dagger in her
hand.</p>

<p>At sight of Wood, she rushed forward and threw herself into
his arms. "Word just reached him that Menofra is dead," she said,
"and I had to kill him."</p>

<p>Wood pressed her to him. "Poor child," he whispered, "what you
must have suffered! But your troubles are over now. The Erythra
have fallen, and we are among friends."</p>

<p>After the fall of Athne, events moved rapidly. Zygo was
summoned from the mountains and restored to his throne by his
hereditary enemies, the Cathneans.</p>

<p>"Now you can live in peace," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Peace!" shouted Thudos and Zygo almost simultaneously. "Who
would care to live always in peace?"</p>

<p>"I replace Zygo on the throne," explained Thudos; "so that we
Cathneans may continue to have foes worthy of our arms. No peace
for us, eh, Zygo?"</p>

<p>"Never, my friend!" replied the king of Athne.</p>

<p>For a week Tarzan and the other Europeans remained in Athne;
then they set off toward the south, taking Spike and Troll and
the great diamond with them. A short march from Athne they met
Muviro with a hundred warriors coming to search for their beloved
Bwana, and thus escorted they returned to the ape-man's own
country.</p>

<p>Here Tarzan let Spike and Troll leave for the coast on the
promise that neither would return to Africa.</p>

<p>As they were leaving, Spike cast sorrowful glances at the
great diamond. "We'd orter get somethin' out o' that," he said.
"After all, we went through a lot o' hell on account of it."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tarzan, "take it with you."</p>

<p>Wood and Gonfala looked at the ape-man in astonishment, but
said nothing until after Troll and Spike had departed; then they
asked why he had given the great diamond to two such
villains.</p>

<p>A slow smile touched the ape-man's lips. "It was not the
Gonfal," he said. "I have that at home. It was the imitation that
Mafka kept to show and to protect the real Gonfal. And something
else that may interest you. I found the great emerald of the Zuli
and buried it in the Bantango country. Some day we'll go and get
that, too. You and Gonfala should be well equipped with wealth
when you return to civilization&mdash;you should have enough to
get you into a great deal of trouble and keep you there all the
rest of your lives."</p> <hr> <br>
