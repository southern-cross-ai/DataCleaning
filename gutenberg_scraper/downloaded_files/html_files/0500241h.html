<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I. &mdash; SAVAGE QUARRY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DOWN out of Tigre and Amhara upon Gojam and Shoa
and Kaffa come the rains from June to September, carrying silt and
prosperity from Abyssinia to the eastern Sudan and to Egypt,
bringing muddy trails and swollen rivers and death and prosperity
to Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Of these gifts of the rains, only the muddy trails and the
swollen rivers and death interested a little band of Shiftas that
held out in the remote fastnesses of the mountains of Kaffa. Hard
men were these mounted bandits, cruel criminals without even a
vestige of culture such as occasionally leavens the activities of
rogues, lessening their ruthlessness. Kaficho and Galla they were,
the off-scourings of their tribes, outlaws, men with prices upon
their heads.</p>

<p>It was not raining now, and the rainy season was drawing to a
close, for it was the middle of September. But there was still much
water in the rivers, and the ground was soft after a recent
rain.</p>

<p>The Shiftas rode, seeking loot from wayfarer, caravan, or
village; and as they rode, the unshod hoofs of their horses left a
plain spoor that one might read upon the run.</p>

<p>A short distance ahead of them, in the direction toward which
they were riding, a hunting beast stalked its prey. The wind was
blowing from it toward the approaching horsemen, and for this
reason their scent spoor was not borne to its sensitive nostrils,
nor did the soft ground give forth any sound beneath the feet of
their walking mounts.</p>

<p>Though the stalker did not resemble a beast of prey, such as the
term connotes to the mind of man, he was one nevertheless, for in
his natural haunts he filled his belly by the chase and by the
chase alone. Neither did he resemble the mental picture that one
might hold of a typical British lord, yet he was that, too&mdash;he
was Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

<p>All beasts of prey find hunting poor during a rain, and Tarzan
was no exception to the rule. It had rained for two days, and as a
result Tarzan was hungry. A small buck was drinking in a stream
fringed by bushes and tall reeds, and Tarzan was worming his way
upon his belly through short grass to reach a position from which
he might either charge or loose an arrow or cast a spear. He was
not aware that a group of horsemen had reined in upon a gentle rise
a short distance behind him where they sat in silence regarding him
intently.</p>

<p>Usha the wind, who carries scent, also carries sound. Today,
Usha carried both the scent and the sound of the Shiftas away from
the keen nostrils and ears of the ape-man.</p>

<p>The circumstances that brought Tarzan northward into Kaffa are
not a part of this story. Perhaps they were not urgent, for the
Lord of the Jungle loves to roam remote fastnesses still unspoiled
by the devastating hand of civilization, and needs but trifling
incentive to do so.</p>

<p>At the moment, however, Tarzan's mind was not occupied by
thoughts of adventure. He did not know that it loomed threateningly
behind him. His concern and his interest were centered upon the
buck which he intended should satisfy the craving of his ravenous
hunger. He crept cautiously forward.</p>

<p>From behind, the white-robed Shiftas moved from the little rise
where they had been watching him in silence, moved down toward him
with spear and long-barreled matchlock. They were puzzled. Never
before had they seen a white man like this one, but if curiosity
was in their minds, there was only murder in their hearts.</p>

<p>The buck raised his head occasionally to glance about him, wary,
suspicious. When he did so, Tarzan froze into immobility. Suddenly
the animal's gaze centered for an instant upon something in the
direction of the ape-man; then it wheeled and bounded away.
Instantly Tarzan glanced behind him, for he knew that it had not
been he who had frightened his quarry, but something beyond and
behind him that the alert eyes of Wappi had discovered. That quick
glance revealed a half-dozen horsemen moving slowly toward him,
told him what they were, and explained their purpose. Knowing that
they were Shiftas, he knew that they came only to rob and
kill&mdash;knew that here were enemies more ruthless than Numa.</p>

<p>When they saw that he had discovered them, the horsemen broke
into a gallop and bore down upon him, waving their weapons and
shouting. They did not fire, evidently holding in contempt this
primitively armed victim, but seemed to purpose riding him down and
trampling him beneath the hoofs of their horses or impaling him
upon their spears.</p>

<p>But Tarzan did not turn and run. He knew every possible avenue
of escape within the radius of his vision for every danger that
might reasonably be expected to confront him here, for it is the
business of the creatures of the wild to know these things if they
are to survive, and so he knew that there was no escape from
mounted men by flight. But this knowledge threw him into no panic.
Could the requirements of self-preservation have been best achieved
by flight, he would have fled, but as they could not, he adopted
the alternative quite as a matter of course&mdash;he stood to
fight, ready to seize upon any fortuitous circumstance that might
offer a chance to escape.</p>

<p>Tall, magnificently proportioned, muscled more like Apollo than
like Hercules, garbed only in a lion skin, he presented a splendid
figure of primitive manhood that suggested more, perhaps, the
demigod of the forest than it did man. Across his back hung his
quiver of arrows and a light, short spear; the loose coils of his
grass rope lay across one bronzed shoulder. At his hip swung the
hunting knife of his father, the knife that had given the
boy-Tarzan the first suggestion of his coming supremacy over the
other beasts of the jungle on that far-gone day when his youthful
hand drove it into the heart of Bolgani the gorilla. In his left
hand was his bow and between the fingers four extra arrows.</p>

<p>As Ara the lightning, so is Tarzan for swiftness. The instant
that he had discovered and recognized the menace creeping upon him
from behind and known that he had been seen by the horsemen, he had
leaped to his feet, and in the same instant strung his bow. Now,
perhaps even before the leading Shiftas realized the danger that
confronted them, the bow was bent, the shaft sped.</p>

<p>Short but powerful was the bow of the ape-man; short, that it
might be easily carried through the forest and the jungle;
powerful, that it might send its shafts through the toughest hide
to a vital organ of its prey. Such a bow was this that no ordinary
man might bend it.</p>

<p>Straight through the heart of the leading Shifta drove the first
arrow, and as the fellow threw his arms above his head and lunged
from his saddle four more arrows sped with lightning-like rapidity
from the bow of the ape-man, and every arrow found a target.
Another Shifta dropped to ride no more, and three were wounded.</p>

<p>Only seconds had elapsed since Tarzan had discovered his danger,
and already the four remaining horsemen were upon him. The three
who were wounded were more interested in the feathered shafts
protruding from their bodies than in the quarry they had expected
so easily to overcome, but the fourth was whole, and he thundered
down upon the ape-man with his spear set for the great chest.</p>

<p>There could be no retreat for Tarzan; there could be no
side-stepping to avoid the thrust, for a step to either side would
have carried him in front of one of the other horsemen. He had but
a single slender hope for survival, and that hope, forlorn though
it appeared, he seized upon with the celerity, strength, and
agility that make Tarzan Tarzan. Slipping his bowstring about his
neck after his final shot, he struck up the point of the menacing
weapon of his antagonist, and grasping the man's arm swung himself
to the horse's back behind the rider.</p>

<p>As steel-thewed fingers closed upon the Shifta's throat he
voiced a single piercing scream; then a knife drove home beneath
his left shoulder blade, and Tarzan hurled the body from the
saddle. The terrified horse, running free with flying reins, tore
through the bushes and the reeds into the river, while the
remaining Shiftas, disabled by their wounds, were glad to abandon
the chase upon the bank, though one of them, retaining more
vitality than his companions, did raise his matchlock and send a
parting shot after the escaping quarry.</p>

<p>The river was a narrow, sluggish stream but deep in the channel,
and as the horse plunged into it, Tarzan saw a commotion in the
water a few yards downstream and then the outline of a long sinuous
body moving swiftly toward them. It was Gimla the crocodile. The
horse saw it too and, becoming frantic, turned upstream in an
effort to escape. Tarzan climbed over the high cantle of the
Abyssinian saddle and unslung his spear in the rather futile hope
of holding the reptile at bay until his mount could reach the
safety of the opposite bank toward which he was now attempting to
guide him.</p>

<p>Gimla is as swift as he is voracious. He was already at the
horse's rump, with opened jaws, when the Shifta at the river's edge
fired wildly at the ape-man. It was well for Tarzan that the
wounded man had fired hurriedly, for simultaneously with the report
of the firearm, the crocodile dove, and the frenzied lashing of the
water about him evidenced the fact that he had been mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>A moment later the horse that Tarzan rode reached the opposite
bank and clambered to the safety of dry land. Now he was under
control again, and the ape-man wheeled him about and sent a parting
arrow across the river toward the angry, cursing bandits upon the
opposite side, an arrow that found its mark in the thigh of the
already wounded man who had unwittingly rescued Tarzan from a
serious situation with the shot that had been intended to kill
him.</p>

<p>To the accompaniment of a few wild and scattered shots, Tarzan
of the Apes galloped toward a nearby forest into which he
disappeared from the sight of the angry Shiftas.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. &mdash; THE WHITE PRISONER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FAR to the south a lion rose from his kill and
walked majestically to the edge of a nearby river. He cast not so
much as a single glance at the circle of hyenas and jackals that
had ringed him and his kill waiting for him to depart and which had
broken and retreated as he rose. Nor, when the hyenas rushed in to
tear at what he had left, did he appear even to see them.</p>

<p>There were the pride and bearing of royalty in the mien of this
mighty beast, and to add to his impressiveness were his great size,
his yellow, almost golden, coat, and his great black mane. When he
had drunk his fill, he lifted his massive head and voiced a roar,
as is the habit of lions when they have fed and drunk, and the
earth shook to his thunderous voice, and a hush fell upon the
jungle.</p>

<p>Now he should have sought his lair and slept, to go forth again
at night and kill, but he did not do so. He did not do at all what
might have been expected of a lion under similar circumstances. He
raised his head and sniffed the air, and then he put his nose to
the ground and moved to and fro like a hunting dog searching for a
game scent. Finally he halted and voiced a low roar; then, with
head raised, he moved off along a trail that led toward the north.
The hyenas were glad to see him go; so were the jackals, who wished
that the hyenas would go also. Ska the vulture, circling above,
wished that they would all leave.</p>

<p>At about the same time, many marches to the north, three angry,
wounded Shiftas viewed their dead comrades and cursed the fate that
had led them upon the trail of the strange white giant. Then they
stripped the clothing and weapons from their dead fellows and rode
away, loudly vowing vengeance should they ever again come upon the
author of their discomfiture and secretly hoping that they never
would. They hoped that they were done with him, but they were
not.</p>

<p><br>
Shortly after he had entered the forest, Tarzan swung to an
overhanging branch beneath which his mount was passing and let the
animal go its way. The ape-man was angry; the Shiftas had
frightened away his dinner. That they had sought to kill him
annoyed him far less than the fact that they had spoiled his
hunting. Now he must commence his search for meat all over again,
but when he had filled his belly he would look into this matter of
Shiftas. Of this he was certain.</p>

<p>Tarzan hunted again until he had found flesh, nor was it long
before he had made his kill and eaten it.</p>

<p>Satisfied, he lay up for a while in the crotch of a tree, but
not for long. His active mind was considering the matter of the
Shiftas. Here was something that should be looked into. If the band
were on the march, he need not concern himself about them, but if
they were permanently located in this district, that was a
different matter. Tarzan expected to be here for some time, and it
was well to know the nature, the number, and the location of all
enemies.</p>

<p>Returning to the river, Tarzan crossed it and took up the plain
trail of the Shiftas. It led him up and down across some low hills
and then down into the narrow valley of the stream that he had
crossed farther up. Here the floor of the valley was forested, the
river winding through the wood. Into this wood the trail led.</p>

<p>It was almost dark now; the brief equatorial twilight was
rapidly fading into night. The nocturnal life of the forest and the
hills was awakening, and from down among the deepening shadows of
the valley came the coughing grunts of a hunting lion. Tarzan
sniffed the warm air rising from the valley toward the mountains;
it carried with it the odors of a camp and the scent spoor of man.
He raised his head, and from his deep chest rumbled a full-throated
roar. Tarzan of the Apes was hunting, too.</p>

<p>In the gathering shadows he stood then, erect and silent, a
lonely figure standing in solitary grandeur upon that desolate
hillside. Swiftly the silent night enveloped him; his figure merged
with the darkness that made hill and valley, river and forest one.
Not until then did Tarzan move; then he stepped down on silent feet
toward the forest. Now was every sense alert, for now the great
cats would be hunting. Often his sensitive nostrils quivered as
they searched the air. No slightest sound escaped his keen
ears.</p>

<p>As he advanced, the man scent became stronger, guiding his
steps. Nearer and nearer sounded the deep cough of the lion, but of
Numa Tarzan had little fear at present, knowing that the great cat,
being upwind, could not be aware of his presence. Doubtless Numa
had heard the ape-man's roar, but he could not know that its author
was approaching him.</p>

<p>Tarzan had estimated the lion's distance down the valley and the
distance that lay between himself and the forest, and had guessed
that he would reach the trees before their paths crossed. He was
not hunting for Numa the lion, and with the natural caution of the
wild beast, he would avoid an encounter.</p>

<p>The mingled odors of a camp grew stronger in his nostrils, the
scents of horses and men and food and smoke.</p>

<p>To you or to me, alone in a savage wilderness, engulfed in
darkness, cognizant of the near approach of a hunting lion, these
odors would have been most welcome. Tarzan's reaction to them was
that of the wild beast that knows man only as an enemy&mdash;his
muscles tensed as he smothered a low growl.</p>

<p>As he reached the edge of the forest, Numa was but a short
distance to his right and approaching, so the ape-man took to the
trees, through which he swung silently to the camp of the
Shiftas.</p>

<p>Below him he saw a band of some twenty men with their horses and
equipment. A rude boma of branches and brush had been erected about
the camp site as a partial protection against wild beasts, but more
dependence was evidently placed upon the fire which they kept
burning in the center of the camp.</p>

<p>In a single quick glance the ape-man took in the details of the
scene below him, and then his eyes came to rest upon the only one
that aroused either interest or curiosity, a white man who lay
securely bound a short distance from the fire.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, Tarzan was no more concerned by the fate of a white
man than by that of a black man or any other created thing to which
he was not bound by ties of friendship. But in this instance there
were two factors that made the life of the captive a matter of
interest to the Lord of the Jungle. First, and probably
predominant, was his desire to be further avenged upon the Shiftas;
the second was curiosity, for the white man that lay bound below
him was different from any that he had seen before.</p>

<p>His only garment appeared to be a habergeon made up of ivory
discs that partially overlay one another, unless certain ankle,
wrist, neck, and head ornaments might have been considered to
possess such utilitarian properties as to entitle them to a similar
classification. Except for these, his arms and legs were naked. His
head rested upon the ground with the face turned away from Tarzan
so that the ape-man could not see his features but only that his
hair was heavy and black.</p>

<p>As he watched the camp, seeking for some suggestion as to how he
might most annoy or inconvenience the bandits, it occurred to
Tarzan that a just reprisal would consist in taking from them
something that they wanted, just as they had deprived him of the
buck he had desired. Evidently they wished the prisoner very much
or they would not have gone to the trouble of securing him so
carefully, so this fact decided Tarzan to steal the white man from
them.</p>

<p>To accomplish his design, he decided to wait until the camp
slept, and settling himself comfortably in a crotch of the tree, he
prepared to keep his vigil with the tireless patience of the
hunting beast he was. As he watched, he saw several of the Shiftas
attempt to communicate with their prisoner, but it was evident that
neither understood the other.</p>

<p>Tarzan was familiar with the language spoken by the Kafichos and
Gallas, and the questions that they put to their prisoner aroused
his curiosity still further. There was one question that they asked
him in many different ways, in several dialects, and in sign which
the captive either did not understand or pretended not to. Tarzan
was inclined to believe that the latter was true, for the sign
language was such that it could scarcely be misunderstood. They
were asking him the way to a place where there was much ivory and
gold, but they got no information from him.</p>

<p>"The pig understands us well enough," growled one of the
Shiftas; "he is just pretending that he does not."</p>

<p>"If he won't tell us, what is the use of carrying him around
with us and feeding him?" demanded another. "We might as well kill
him now."</p>

<p>"We will let him think it over tonight," replied one who was
evidently the leader, "and if he still refuses to speak in the
morning, we will kill him then."</p>

<p>This decision they attempted to transmit to the prisoner both by
words and signs, and then they squatted about the fire and
discussed the occurrences of the day and their plans for the
future. The principal topic of their conversation was the strange
white giant who had slain three of their number and had escaped
upon one of their horses. After this had been debated thoroughly
and in detail for some time, and the three survivors of the
encounter had boasted severally of their deeds of valor, they
withdrew to the rude shelters they had constructed and left the
night to Tarzan, Numa, and a single sentry.</p>

<p>The silent watcher among the shadows of the tree waited on in
patience until the camp should be sunk in deepest slumber and,
waiting, planned the stroke that was to rob the Shiftas of their
prey and satisfy his own desire for revenge.</p>

<p>At last the ape-man felt that the time had come when he might
translate his plan into action; all but the sentry were wrapped in
slumber, and even he was dozing beside the fire. As noiselessly as
the shadow of a shadow, Tarzan descended from the tree, keeping
well in the shadow cast by the fire.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood in silence, listening. He heard the
breathing of Numa, in the darkness beyond the circle of firelight,
and knew that the king of beasts was near and watching. Then he
looked from behind the great bole of the tree and saw that the
sentry's back was still turned toward him. Silently he moved into
the open; stealthily, on soundless feet, he crept toward the
unsuspecting bandit. He saw the matchlock across the fellow's
knees: and for it he had respect, as have all jungle animals that
have been hunted.</p>

<p>Closer and closer he came to his prey. At last he crouched
directly behind him. There must be no noise, no outcry. Tarzan
waited. Beyond the rim of fire waited Numa, expectant, for he saw
that very gradually the flames were diminishing. A bronzed hand
shot quickly forward; fingers of steel gripped the brown throat of
the sentry almost at the instant that a knife was driven from below
his left shoulder blade into his heart. The sentry was dead without
knowing that death threatened him.</p>

<p>Tarzan withdrew the knife from the limp body and wiped the blade
upon the once white robe of his victim; then he moved softly toward
the prisoner who was lying in the open. For him, they had not
bothered to build a shelter. As he made his way toward the man,
Tarzan passed close to two of the shelters in which lay members of
the band, but he made no noise that might awaken them. When he
approached the captive more closely, he saw in the diminishing
light of the fire that the man's eyes were open and that he was
regarding Tarzan with level, though questioning, gaze. The ape-man
put a finger to his lips to enjoin silence, and then he came and
knelt beside the man and cut the thongs that secured his wrists and
ankles. He helped him to his feet, for the thongs had been drawn
tightly, and his legs were numb.</p>

<p>For a moment he waited while the stranger tested his feet and
moved them rapidly in an effort to restore circulation; then he
beckoned him to follow, and all would have been well but for Numa
the lion. At this moment, either to voice his anger against the
flames or to terrify the horses into a stampede, he elected to
voice a thunderous roar.</p>

<p>So close was the lion that the sudden shattering of the deep
silence of the night startled every sleeper to wakefulness. A dozen
men seized their matchlocks and leaped from their shelters. In the
waning light of the fire they saw no lion, but they saw their
liberated captive, and they saw Tarzan of the Apes standing beside
him.</p>

<p>Among those who ran from the shelters was the least seriously
wounded of Tarzan's victims of the afternoon. Instantly recognizing
the bronzed white giant, he shouted loudly to his companions, "It
is he! It is the white demon who killed our friends."</p>

<p>"Kill him!" screamed another.</p>

<p>Completely surrounding the two white men, the Shiftas advanced
upon them, but they dared not fire because of the fear that they
might wound one of their own comrades.</p>

<p>Tarzan could not loose an arrow or cast a spear, for he had left
all his weapons except his rope and his knife hidden in the tree
above the camp.</p>

<p>One of the bandits, more courageous, probably because less
intelligent than his fellows, rushed to close quarters with musket
clubbed. It was his undoing. The man-beast crouched, growling, and,
as the other was almost upon him, charged. The musket butt,
hurtling through the air to strike him down, he dodged, and then
seized the weapon and wrenched it from the Shifta's grasp as though
it had been a toy in a child's hands.</p>

<p>Tossing the matchlock at the feet of his companion, Tarzan laid
hold upon the rash Galla, spun him around, and held him as a shield
against the weapons of his fellows. But despite this reverse the
other Shiftas gave no indication of giving up.</p>

<p>Two of them rushed in behind the ape-man, for it was he they
feared the more; but they were to learn that their former prisoner
might not be considered lightly. He had picked up a musket and,
grasping it close to the muzzle, was using it as a club.</p>

<p>A quick backward glance assured Tarzan that his companion was
proving himself a worthy ally, but it was evident that they could
not hope to hold out long against the superior numbers pitted
against them. Their only hope, he believed, lay in making a sudden,
concerted rush through the thin line of foemen surrounding them,
and he sought to convey his plan to the man standing back to back
with him. But though he spoke to him in English and in several
continental languages, the only reply he received was in a language
that he himself had never before heard.</p>

<p>What was he to do? They must go together, and both must
understand the purpose animating Tarzan. But how was that possible
if they could not communicate with one another? Tarzan turned and
touched the other lightly on the shoulder; then he jerked his thumb
in the direction he intended going and beckoned with a nod of his
head.</p>

<p>Instantly the man nodded his understanding and wheeled about as
Tarzan started to charge. Using the man in his grasp as a flail,
Tarzan sought to mow down those standing between him and liberty,
but there were many of them, and presently they succeeded in
dragging their comrade from the clutches of the ape-man. Now it
seemed that the situation of the two whites was hopeless.</p>

<p>One fellow in particular was well-placed to fire without
endangering any of his fellows, and raising his matchlock to his
shoulder he took careful aim at Tarzan.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. &mdash; CATS BY NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS the man raised his weapon to his shoulder to
fire at Tarzan, a scream of warning burst from the lips of one of
his comrades, to be drowned by the throaty roar of Numa the lion,
as the swift rush of his charge carried him over the boma into the
midst of the camp.</p>

<p>The man who would have killed Tarzan cast a quick backward
glance as the warning cry apprised him of his danger. When he saw
the lion, he cast away his rifle in his excitement and terror, his
terrified scream mingled with the voice of Numa, and in his anxiety
to escape the fangs of the man-eater he rushed into the arms of the
ape-man.</p>

<p>The lion, momentarily confused by the firelight and the swift
movement of the men, paused, crouching, as he looked to right and
left. In that brief instant Tarzan seized the fleeing Shifta, and
lifted him into the face of Numa; then he motioned to his companion
to follow him, and, running directly past the lion, leaped the boma
at the very point that Numa had leaped it. Close at his heels was
the white captive of the Shiftas, and before the bandits had
recovered from the first shock and surprise of the lion's
unexpected charge, the two had disappeared in the shadows of the
night.</p>

<p>Just outside the camp Tarzan left his companion for a moment
while he swung into the tree where he had left his weapons and
recovered them; then he led the way out of the valley up into the
hills. At his elbow trotted the silent white man he had rescued
from certain death at the hands of the Kaficho and Galla
bandits.</p>

<p>During the brief encounter in the camp, Tarzan had noted with
admiration the strength, agility, and courage of the stranger who
had aroused both his interest and his curiosity. Here, seemingly,
was a man molded to the dimensions of Tarzan's own standards, a
quiet, resourceful, courageous fighting man. Radiating that
intangible aura which we call personality, even in his silences he
impressed the ape-man with a conviction that loyalty and
dependability were innate characteristics of the man; so Tarzan,
who ordinarily preferred to be alone, was not displeased to have
the companionship of this stranger.</p>

<p>The moon, almost full, had risen above the black mountain mass
to the east, shedding her soft light on hill and valley and forest,
transforming the scene once more into that of a new world which was
different from the world of daylight and from the world of moonless
night, a world of strange grays and silvery greens.</p>

<p>Up toward a fringe of forest that clothed the upper slopes of
the foothills and dipped down into canyon and ravine the two men
moved as noiselessly as the passing shadow of a cloud; yet to one
hidden in the dark recesses of the wood above, their approach was
not unheralded, for on the breath of Usha the wind it was borne
ahead of them to the cunning nostrils of the prince of hunters.</p>

<p>Sheeta the panther was hungry. For several days prey had been
scarce and elusive. Now, in his nostrils, the scent of the
man-things grew stronger as they drew nearer. Eagerly, Sheeta the
panther awaited the coming of the men.</p>

<p>Within the forest, Tarzan sought a tree where they might lie up
for the night. He found a branch that forked horizontally. With his
hunting knife he cut other branches and laid them across the two
arms of the Y thus formed. Over this rude platform he spread
leaves, and then he lay down to sleep, while from an adjacent tree
upwind Sheeta watched him. Sheeta also watched the other man-thing
on the ground between the two trees. The great cat did not move; he
seemed scarcely to breathe.</p>

<p>Even Tarzan was unaware of his presence, yet the ape-man was
restless. He listened intently and sniffed the air, but detected
nothing amiss. Below him, his companion was making his bed upon the
ground in preference to risking the high-flung branches of the
trees to which he was unaccustomed. It was the man upon the ground
that Sheeta watched.</p>

<p>At last, his bed of leaves and grasses arranged to suit him,
Tarzan's companion lay down. Sheeta waited. Gradually, almost
imperceptibly, the sinuous muscles were drawing the hindquarters
forward beneath the sleek body in preparation for the spring.
Sheeta edged forward on the great limb upon which he crouched, but
in doing so he caused the branch to move slightly and the leaves at
its end to rustle a little.</p>

<p>Tarzan heard, and his eyes, turning quickly, sought and found
the intruder. At the same instant Sheeta launched himself at the
man lying on his rude pallet on the ground below, and as Sheeta
sprang so did Tarzan.</p>

<p>Tarzan voiced a roar that was intended both to warn his
companion and to distract the attention of Sheeta from his prey.
The man upon the ground leaped quickly to one side, prompted more
by an instinctive reaction than by reason. The panther's body
brushed him as it struck the ground, but the beast's thoughts were
now upon the thing that had voiced that menacing roar rather than
upon its intended prey.</p>

<p>Wheeling as he leaped aside, the man turned and saw the savage
carnivore just as Tarzan landed full upon the beast's back. He
heard the mingled growls of the two as they closed in battle, and
his scalp stiffened as he realized that the sounds coming from the
lips of his companion were quite as bestial as those issuing from
the throat of the carnivore.</p>

<p>Tarzan sought a hold about the neck of the panther, while the
great cat instantly attempted to roll over on its back that it
might rip the body of its antagonist to shreds with the terrible
talons that armed its hind feet. But this strategy the ape-man had
anticipated, and rolling beneath Sheeta as Sheeta rolled, he locked
his powerful legs beneath the belly of the panther. Then the great
cat leaped to its feet again and sought to shake the man-thing from
its back, and all the while a mighty arm was tightening about its
neck, closing off its wind.</p>

<p>Tarzan had succeeded in drawing his knife. Momentarily the blade
flashed before his eyes; then it was buried in the body of Sheeta.
The cat, screaming from pain and rage, redoubled its efforts to
dislodge the creature clinging to it in the embrace of death, but
again the knife fell. Now Sheeta stood trembling upon uncertain
feet as once again the knife was plunged deeply into his side;
then, his great voice forever stilled, he sank lifeless to the
ground as the ape-man rolled from beneath him and sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p>The man whose life Tarzan had saved came forward and laid a hand
upon the shoulder of the ape-man, speaking a few words in a low
voice but in the tongue that Tarzan did not understand, though he
guessed that it expressed the gratitude that the manner of the man
betokened.</p>

<p>Influenced by the attack of the panther and knowing that Numa
was abroad, Tarzan, by signs, persuaded the man to come up into the
tree. Here the ape-man helped him construct a nest similar to his
own. For the balance of the night they slept in peace, and the sun
was an hour old before either stirred the following morning. Then
the ape-man rose and stretched himself.</p>

<p>Nearby, the other man sat up and looked about him. His eyes met
Tarzan's, and he smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>The wild beast in Tarzan looked into the brown eyes of the
stranger and was satisfied that here was one who must be trusted;
the man in him noted the headband that confined the black hair, saw
the strangely wrought ivory ornament in the center of the forehead,
the habergeon that he was now donning, the ivory ornaments on
wrists and ankles, and found his curiosity piqued.</p>

<p>The ivory ornament in the center of the headband was shaped like
a concave, curved trowel, the point of which projected above the
top of the man's head and curved forward. His wristlets and anklets
were of long flat strips of ivory laid close together and fastened
around the limbs by leather thongs that were laced through holes
piercing the strips near their tops and bottoms. His sandals were
of heavy leather, apparently elephant hide, and were supported by
leather thongs fastened to the bottoms of his anklets.</p>

<p>That all these trappings were solely for purposes of
ornamentation Tarzan did not believe. He saw that almost without
exception they would serve as a protection against a cutting weapon
such as a sword or battle-axe.</p>

<p>But speculation concerning this matter was relegated to the
background of his thoughts by hunger and recollection of the
remains of yesterday's kill that he had hung high in a tree of the
forest farther up the river. He dropped lightly to the ground,
motioning the young warrior to follow him, and set off in the
direction of his cache, keeping his keen senses always on the alert
for enemies.</p>

<p>Cleverly hidden by leafy branches, the meat was intact when
Tarzan reached it. He cut several strips and tossed them down to
the warrior waiting on the ground below; then he cut some for
himself and crouching in a crotch proceeded to eat it raw. His
companion watched him for a moment in surprise: then he made fire
with a bit of steel and flint and cooked his own portion.</p>

<p>As he ate, Tarzan's active mind was considering plans for the
future. He had come to Abyssinia for a specific purpose, though the
matter was not of such immediate importance that it demanded
instant attention. In fact, in the philosophy that a lifetime of
primitive environment had inspired, time was not an important
consideration.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of this ivory-armored warrior aroused questions
that intrigued his interest to a far greater extent than did the
problems that had brought him thus far from his own stamping
grounds, and he decided that the latter should wait the solving of
the riddle that his new-made acquaintance presented.</p>

<p>Having no other means of communication than signs rendered an
exchange of ideas between the two difficult, but when they had
finished their meal and Tarzan had descended to the ground, he
succeeded in asking his companion in what direction he wished to
go. The warrior pointed in a north-easterly direction toward the
high mountains, and, as plainly as he could through the medium of
signs, invited Tarzan to accompany him to his country. This
invitation Tarzan accepted and motioned the other to lead the
way.</p>

<p><br>
For days that stretched to weeks the two men struck deeper and
deeper into the heart of a stupendous mountain system. Always
mentally alert and eager to learn, Tarzan took advantage of the
opportunity to learn the language of his companion, and he proved
such an apt pupil that they were soon able to make themselves
understood by one another.</p>

<p>Among the first things that Tarzan learned was that his
companion's name was Valthor, while Valthor took the earliest
opportunity to evince an interest in the ape-man's weapons. As he
was unarmed, Tarzan spent a day in making a spear and bow and
arrows for him. Thereafter, as Valthor taught the Lord of the
Jungle to speak his language, Tarzan instructed the former in the
use of the bow, the spear being already a familiar weapon to the
young warrior.</p>

<p>Thus the days and the weeks passed and the two seemed no nearer
the country of Valthor than when they had started from the vicinity
of the camp of the Shiftas. Tarzan found game of certain varieties
plentiful in the mountains. He hunted, and enjoyed the beauties of
unspoiled nature, practically oblivious of the passage of time.</p>

<p>But Valthor was less patient, and at last, late one day when
they found themselves at the head of a blind canyon where
stupendous cliffs barred further progress, he admitted defeat. "I
am lost," he said simply.</p>

<p>"That," remarked Tarzan, "I could have told you many days
ago."</p>

<p>Valthor looked at him in surprise. "How could you know that," he
demanded, "when you yourself do not know in what direction my
country lies?"</p>

<p>"I know," replied the ape-man, "because during the past week you
have led the way toward the four points of the compass, and today
we are within five miles of where we were a week ago. Across this
ridge at our right, not more than five miles away, is the little
stream where I killed the ibex, and the gnarled old tree in which
we slept that night just seven suns ago."</p>

<p>Valthor scratched his head in perplexity, and then he smiled. "I
cannot dispute you," he admitted. "Perhaps you are right, but what
are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"Do you know in what direction your country lies from the camp
in which I found you?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The valley of Thenar is due east of that point," replied
Valthor; "of that I am positive."</p>

<p>"Then we are directly southwest of it now, for we have traveled
a considerable distance toward the south since we entered the
higher mountains. If your country lies in these mountains, then it
should not be difficult to find it if we can keep moving always in
a northeasterly direction."</p>

<p>"This jumble of mountains with their twisting canyons and gorges
confuses me," Valthor admitted. "You see, in all my life before, I
have never been farther from Ihenar than the valley of Onthar, and
both these valleys are surrounded by landmarks with which I am so
familiar that I need no other guides. It has never been necessary
for me to consult the positions of the sun, the moon, nor the stars
before, and so they have been of no help to me since we set out in
search of Thenar. Do you believe that you could hold a course
toward the northeast in this maze of mountains? If you can, then
you had better lead the way rather than I."</p>

<p>"I can go toward the northeast," Tarzan assured him, "but I
cannot find your country unless it lies in my path."</p>

<p>"If we reach a point within fifty or a hundred miles of it, from
some high eminence we shall see Xarator," explained Valthor, "and
then I shall know my way to Thenar, for Xarator is almost due west
of Athne."</p>

<p>"What are Xarator and Athne?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Xarator is a great peak, the center of which is filled with
fire and molten rock. It lies at the north end of the valley of
Onthar and belongs to the men of Cathne, the city of gold. Athne,
the city of ivory, is the city from which I come. The men of
Cathne, in the valley of Onthar, are the enemies of my people."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, then," said Tarzan, "we shall set out for the city of
Athne in the valley of Thenar."</p>

<p><br>
As Tarzan and Valthor ate meat that they had cut from yesterday's
kill and carried with them, many weary miles to the south a
black-maned lion lashed his tail angrily and voiced a savage growl
as he stood over the body of a buffalo calf he had killed, and
faced an angry bull pawing the earth and bellowing a few yards
away.</p>

<p>Rare is the beast that will face Gorgo the buffalo, when rage
inflames his red-rimmed eyes, but the great lion showed no
intention of leaving its prey even in the face of the bull's
threatened charge. He stood his ground. The roars of the lion and
the bull mingled in a savage, thunderous dissonance that shook the
ground, stilling the voices of the lesser people of the jungle.</p>

<p>Gorgo gored the earth, working himself into a frenzy of rage.
Behind him, bellowing, stood the mother of the slain calf. Perhaps
she was urging her lord and master to avenge the murder. The other
members of the herd had bolted into the thickest of the jungle,
leaving these two to contest with Numa his right to his kill,
leaving vengeance to those powerful horns backed by that massive
neck.</p>

<p>With a celerity and agility that belied his great weight, the
bull charged. That two such huge beasts could move so quickly and
so lightly seemed incredible, as it seemed incredible that any
creature could either withstand or avoid the menace of those mighty
horns. But the lion was ready, and as the bull was almost upon him,
he leaped to one side, reared upon his hind feet, and with one
massive, taloned paw struck the bull a terrific blow on the side of
its head that wheeled it half around and sent it stumbling to its
knees, half-stunned and bleeding, its great jawbone crushed and
splintered. And before Gorgo could regain his feet, Numa leaped
full upon his back, buried his teeth in the bulging muscles of the
great neck, and with one paw reached for the nose of the bellowing
bull, jerking the head back with a mighty surge that snapped the
vertebrae.</p>

<p>Instantly the lion was on his feet again, facing the cow, but
she did not charge. Instead, bellowing, she crashed away into the
jungle, leaving the king of beasts standing with his forefeet upon
his latest kill.</p>

<p>That night Numa fed well, but when he had gorged himself he did
not lie up as a lion should, but continued toward the north along
the mysterious trail he had been following for many days.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. &mdash; DOWN THE FLOOD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE new day dawned cloudy and threatening. The
season of rains was over, but it appeared that a belated storm was
gathering above the lofty peaks through which Tarzan and Valthor
were searching for the elusive valley of Thenar.</p>

<p>All day they moved toward the northeast. Sometimes it rained a
little, and always it threatened to rain more. A great storm seemed
always to be gathering, yet it never broke during the long day.
Tarzan made a kill before noon, and they ate, but immediately
afterward they started on again.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when they ascended out of a deep
gorge and stood upon a lofty plateau. In the near foreground were
no mountains, but at a distance lofty peaks were visible dimly
through a light drizzle of rain.</p>

<p>Suddenly Valthor voiced an exclamation of elation. "We have
found it!" he cried. "There is Xarator!"</p>

<p>Tarzan looked in the direction that the other pointed and saw a
mighty, flat-topped peak in the distance, directly above which low
clouds were reflecting a dull red light. "So that is Xarator!" he
remarked. "And Thenar is directly east of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Valthor, "which means that Onthar must be just
below the edge of this plateau, almost directly in front of us.
Come!"</p>

<p>The two walked quickly over the level, grassy ground for a mile
or two to come at length to the edge of the plateau beyond which,
and below them, stretched a wide valley.</p>

<p>"We are almost at the southern end of Onthar," said Valthor.
"There is Cathne, the city of gold. It is a rich city, but its
people are the enemies of my people."</p>

<p>Through the rain, Tarzan saw a walled city between a forest and
a river. The houses were nearly all white, and there were many
domes of dull yellow. The river, which ran between them and the
city, was spanned by a bridge that was also a dull yellow color in
the twilight of the late afternoon storm. Tarzan saw that the river
extended the full length of the valley, a distance of fourteen or
fifteen miles, being fed by smaller streams coming down out of the
mountains. Also extending the length of the valley was what
appeared to be a well marked road.</p>

<p>Tarzan's eyes wandered back to the city of Cathne.</p>

<p>"Why do you call it the city of gold?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Do you not see the golden domes and the bridge of gold?"
demanded Valthor.</p>

<p>"Are they covered with gold paint?" inquired Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They are covered with solid gold," replied Valthor.</p>

<p>"The gold on some of the domes is an inch thick, and the bridge
is built of solid blocks of gold."</p>

<p>"Where do they find their gold?" Tarzan asked.</p>

<p>"Their mines lie in the hills directly south of the city,"
replied Valthor.</p>

<p>"And where is your country, Thenar?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Just beyond the hills east of Onthar. Do you see where the
river and the road cut through the forest about five miles above
the city? You can see them entering the hills just beyond the
forest."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tarzan, "I see."</p>

<p>"The road and the river run through the Pass of the Warriors
into the valley of Thenar: a little north-east of the center of the
valley lies Athne, the city of ivory. There, beyond the pass, is my
country."</p>

<p>"How far are we from Athne?" inquired Tarzan.</p>

<p>"About twenty-five miles, possibly a little less," replied
Valthor.</p>

<p>"We might as well start now, then," suggested the ape-man, "for
in this rain it will be more comfortable to be on the march than to
lie up until morning, and in your city we can find a dry place to
sleep, I presume."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Valthor, "but it will not be safe to
attempt to cross Onthar by daylight. We should certainly be seen by
the sentries on the gates of Cathne, and, as these people are our
enemies, the chances are that we should never cross the valley
without being either killed or taken prisoners."</p>

<p>"Whatever you wish," agreed Tarzan with a shrug; "it is all the
same to me if we start now or wait until dark."</p>

<p>"It is not very comfortable here," remarked the Athnean. "The
rain is cold."</p>

<p>"I have been uncomfortable before," replied Tarzan; "rains do
not last forever."</p>

<p>"If we were in Athne we should be very comfortable," sighed
Valthor. "In my father's house there are fireplaces. Even now the
flames are roaring about great logs, and all is warmth and
comfort."</p>

<p>"Above the clouds the sun is shining," replied Tarzan, "but we
are not above the clouds. We are here where the sun is not shining
and there is no fire, and we are cold." A faint smile touched his
lips. "It does not warm me to speak of fires or the sun."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I wish I were in Athne," insisted Valthor. "It is
a splendid city, and Thenar is a lovely valley. In Thenar we raise
goats and sheep and elephants. In Thenar there are no lions except
those that stray in from Onthar; those we kill. Our farmers raise
vegetables and fruits and hay; our artisans manufacture leather
goods. They make cloth from the hair of goats and the wool of
sheep. Our carvers work in ivory and wood.</p>

<p>"We trade a little with the outside world, paying for what we
buy with ivory and gold. Were it not for the Cathneans we should
lead a happy, peaceful life without a care."</p>

<p>"What do you buy from the outside world, and of whom do you buy
it?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"We buy salt, of which we have none of our own," explained
Valthor. "We also buy steel for our weapons. These things we buy
from a band of Shiftas. With this same band we have traded since
before the memory of man. Shifta chiefs and kings of Athne have
come and gone, but our relations with this band have never altered.
I was searching for them when I became lost and was captured by
another band."</p>

<p>"Do you never trade with the people of Cathne?" asked the
ape-man.</p>

<p>"Once each year there is a week's truce during which we trade
with them in peace. They give us gold and foodstuffs and hay in
exchange for the salt and the steel we buy from the Shiftas, and
the cloth, leather, and ivory that we produce.</p>

<p>"Besides mining gold, the Cathneans breed lions for war and
sport, raise fruits, vegetables, cereals, and hay, and work in gold
and, to a lesser extent, in ivory. Their gold and their hay are the
products most valuable to us, and of these we value the hay more,
for without it we should have to decrease our elephant herds."</p>

<p>"Why should two peoples so dependent upon one another fight?"
asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>Valthor shrugged. "I do not know; perhaps it is just a custom.
Yet, though we talk much of wanting peace, we should miss the
thrills and excitement that peace does not hold." His eyes
brightened. "The raids!" he exclaimed. "There is a sport for men.
The Cathneans come with their lions to hunt our goats, our sheep,
our elephants, and us. When we wish sport we go into Onthar after
gold. No, I do not think that either we or Cathneans would care for
peace."</p>

<p>For some time the two talked. Valthor told of his life in Athne.
And as Valthor talked, the invisible sun sank over into the west;
heavy clouds, dark and ominous, hid the peaks to the north,
settling low over the upper end of the valley. "I think we may
start now," Valthor said. "It will soon be dark."</p>

<p>Downward through a gully, the sides of which hid them from the
city of Cathne, the two men made their way towards the floor of the
valley. From the heavy storm clouds burst a flash of lightning
followed by the roar of thunder; upon the upper end of the valley
the storm god loosed his wrath; water fell in a deluge, wiping from
their sight the hills beyond the storm.</p>

<p>By the time they reached level ground the storm was upon them
and the gully they had descended a raging mountain torrent. The
swift night had fallen; utter darkness surrounded them, darkness
frequently broken by vivid flashes of lightning. The pealing of the
constant thunder was deafening. The rain engulfed them in solid
sheets like the waves of the ocean. It was, perhaps, the most
terrific storm that either of these men had ever seen.</p>

<p>They could not converse; only the lightning prevented their
becoming separated, as it alone permitted Valthor to keep his
course across the grassy floor of the valley in the direction of
the city of gold, where they would find the road that led to the
Pass of the Warriors and on into the valley of Thenar.</p>

<p>Presently they came within sight of the lights of the city, a
few dim lights framed by the casements of windows, and a moment
later they were on the road and were moving northward against the
full fury of the storm.</p>

<p>For miles they pitted their muscles against the Herculean
strength of the storm god. The rage of the storm god seemed to rise
against them, knowing no bounds, as though he was furious that
these two puny mortals should pit their strength against his.
Suddenly, as though in a last titanic effort to overcome them, the
lightning burst into a mighty blaze that illuminated the entire
valley for seconds, the thunder crashed as it had never crashed
before, and a mass of water fell that crushed the two men to
earth.</p>

<p>As they staggered to their feet again, foot-deep water swirled
about their legs; they stood in a broad, racing torrent that rushed
past them towards the river. But in that last effort the storm god
had spent his force. The rain ceased; through a rift in the dark
clouds the moon looked down, perhaps in wonder, upon a drowned
world, and Valthor led the way again towards the Pass of the
Warriors. The last of the rainy season was over.</p>

<p>It is seven miles from the bridge of gold, that is the gateway
to the city of Cathne, to the ford where the road to Thenar crosses
the river. It required three hours for Valthor and Tarzan to cover
the distance, but at last they stood at the river's bank.</p>

<p>A boiling flood confronted them, tearing down a widened river
towards the city of Cathne. Valthor hesitated. "Ordinarily," he
said to Tarzan, "the water is little more than a foot deep. It must
be three feet deep now.</p>

<p>"And it will soon be deeper," commented the ape-man. "Only a
small portion of the storm waters have had time to reach this point
from the hills and the upper valley. If we are going to cross
tonight, we shall have to do it now."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Valthor, "but follow me; I know the
ford."</p>

<p>As the Athnean stepped into the water, the clouds closed again
beneath the moon and plunged the world once more into darkness. As
Tarzan followed he could scarcely see his guide ahead of him, and
since Valthor knew the ford he moved more rapidly than the ape-man
with the result that presently Tarzan could not see him at all, but
he felt his way towards the opposite bank without thought of
disaster.</p>

<p>The force of the stream was mighty, but mighty, too, are the
thews of Tarzan of the Apes. The water, which Valthor had thought
to be three feet in depth, was soon surging to the ape-man's waist,
and then he missed the ford and stepped into a hole. Instantly the
current seized him and swept him away; not even the giant muscles
of Tarzan could cope with the might of the flood.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Jungle fought the swirling waters in an effort
to reach the opposite shore, but in their embrace he was
powerless.</p>

<p>Finding even his great strength powerless and weakening, Tarzan
gave up the struggle to reach the opposite bank and devoted his
efforts to keeping his nose above the surface of the angry flood.
Even this was none too easy an accomplishment, as the rushing
waters had a trick of twisting him about or turning him over. Often
his head was submerged, and sometimes he floated feet first and
sometimes head first, but he tried to rest his muscles as best he
could against the time when some vagary of the torrent might carry
him within reach of the bank upon one side or the other.</p>

<p>He knew that several miles below the city of Cathne the river
entered a narrow gorge, for that he had seen from the edge of the
plateau from which he had first viewed the valley of Onthar.
Valthor had told him that beyond the gorge it tumbled in a mighty
falls a hundred feet to the bottom of a rocky canyon. Should he not
succeed in escaping the clutches of the torrent before it carried
him into the gorge his doom was sealed, but Tarzan felt neither
fear nor panic. His life had been in jeopardy often during his
savage existence, yet he still lived.</p>

<p>He wondered what had become of Valthor. Perhaps he, too, was
being hurtled along either above or below him. But such was not the
fact. Valthor had reached the opposite bank in safety and waited
there for Tarzan. When the ape-man did not appear within a
reasonable time, the Athnean shouted his name aloud, but though he
received no answer he was still not sure that Tarzan was not upon
the opposite side of the river, the loud roaring of which might
have drowned the sound of the voice of either.</p>

<p>Then Valthor decided to wait until daylight, rather than abandon
his friend in a country with which he was entirely unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Through the long night he waited and, with the coming of dawn,
eagerly scanned the opposite bank of the river, his slender hope
for the safety of his friend dying when daylight failed to reveal
any sign of him. Then, at last, he was convinced that Tarzan had
been swept away to his death by the raging flood, and, with a heavy
heart, he turned away from the river and resumed his interrupted
journey towards the Pass of the Warriors and the valley of
Thenar.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. &mdash; THE CITY OF GOLD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Tarzan battled for his life in the swirling
waters of the swollen river, he lost all sense of time; the
seemingly interminable struggle against death might have been
enduring without beginning, might endure without end, in so far as
his numbed senses were concerned.</p>

<p>Turnings in the river cast him occasionally against one shore
and then the other. Always, then, his hands reached up in an
attempt to grasp something that might stay his mad rush towards the
falls and death. At last success crowned his efforts&mdash;his
fingers closed upon the stem of a heavy vine that trailed down the
bank into the swirling waters, closed and held.</p>

<p>Hand over hand the man dragged himself out of the water and onto
the bank, where he lay for several minutes; then he rose slowly to
his feet, shook himself like some great lion, and looked about him
in the darkness, trying to penetrate the impenetrable night.
Faintly, as through shrubbery, he thought that he saw a light
shining dimly in the distance. Where there was a light, there
should be men. Tarzan moved cautiously toward it to investigate.</p>

<p>But a few steps from the river Tarzan encountered a wall, and
when he was close to the wall he could no longer see the light.
Reaching upward, he discovered that the top of the wall was still
above the tips of his outstretched fingers&mdash;but walls which
were made to keep one out also invited one to climb them.</p>

<p>Stepping back a few paces. Tarzan ran toward the wall and sprang
upward. His extended fingers gripped the tip of the wall and clung
there. Slowly he drew himself up, threw a leg across the capstones,
and looked to see what might be seen upon the opposite side of the
wall.</p>

<p>He did not see much&mdash;a square of dim light forty or fifty
feet away&mdash;that was all, and it did not satisfy his curiosity.
Silently he lowered himself to the ground upon the same side as the
light and moved cautiously forward. Beneath his bare feet he felt
stone flagging, and guessed that he was in a paved courtyard.</p>

<p>He had crossed about half the distance to the light when the
retreating storm flashed a farewell bolt from the distance. This
distant lightning but barely sufficed to relieve momentarily the
darkness surrounding the ape-man, revealing a low building, a
lighted window, a deeply recessed doorway in the shelter of which
stood a man. It also revealed Tarzan to the man in the doorway.</p>

<p>Instantly the silence was shattered by the brazen clatter of a
gong. The door swung open, and men bearing torches rushed out.
Tarzan, impelled by the natural caution of the beast, turned to
run, but as he did so, he saw other open doors upon his flanks, and
armed men with torches were rushing from these as well.</p>

<p>Realizing that flight was useless, Tarzan stood still with
folded arms as the men converged upon him from three directions.</p>

<p>The torches carried by some of the men showed Tarzan that he was
in a paved, quadrangular courtyard enclosed by buildings upon three
sides and the wall he had scaled upon the fourth. Their light also
revealed the fact that he was being surrounded by some fifty men
armed with spears, the points of which were directed toward him in
a menacing circle.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded one of the men as the cordon drew
tightly about him. The language in which the man spoke was the same
as that which Tarzan had learned from Valthor, the common language
of the enemy cities of Athne and Cathne.</p>

<p>"I am a stranger from a country far to the south," replied the
ape-man.</p>

<p>"What are you doing inside the walls of the palace of Nemone?"
The speaker's voice was threatening, his tone accusatory.</p>

<p>"I was crossing the river far above here when the flood caught
me and swept me down; it was only by chance that I finally made a
landing here."</p>

<p>The man who had been questioning him shrugged. "Well," he
admitted, "it is not for me to question you, anyway. Come! You will
have a chance to tell your story to an officer, but he will not
believe it either."</p>

<p>They conducted Tarzan into a large, low-ceilinged room which was
furnished with rough benches and tables. Upon the walls hung
weapons, spears and swords. There were shields of elephant hide
studded with gold bosses. Upon the walls were mounted the heads of
animals; there were the heads of sheep and goats and lions and
elephants.</p>

<p>Two men guarded Tarzan in one corner of the room, while another
was dispatched to notify a superior of the capture. The remainder
loafed about the room, talking, playing games, cleaning their
weapons. The prisoner took the opportunity to examine his
captors.</p>

<p>They were well-set-up men, many of them not ill-favored, though
for the most part of ignorant and brutal appearance. Their helmets,
habergeons, wristlets, and anklets were of elephant hide heavily
embossed with gold studs. Long hair from the manes of lions fringed
the tops of their anklets and wristlets and was also used for
ornamental purposes along the crests of their helmets and upon some
of their shields and weapons. The elephant hide that composed their
habergeons was cut into discs, and the habergeon fabricated in a
manner similar to that one of ivory which Valthor had worn. In the
center of each shield was a heavy boss of solid gold. Upon the
harnesses and weapons of these common soldiers was a fortune in the
precious metal.</p>

<p>While Tarzan, immobile, silent, surveyed the scene with eyes
that seemed scarcely to move yet missed no detail, two warriors
entered the room, and the instant that they crossed the threshold
silence fell upon the men congregated in the chamber. Tarzan knew
by that these were officers, though their trappings would have been
sufficient evidence of their superior stations in life.</p>

<p>At a word of command from one of the two, the common warriors
fell back, clearing one end of the room; then the two seated
themselves at a table and ordered Tarzan's guards to bring him
forward. As the Lord of the Jungle halted before them, both men
surveyed him critically.</p>

<p>"Why are you in Onthar?" demanded one who was evidently the
superior, since he propounded all the questions during the
interview.</p>

<p>Tarzan answered this and other questions as he had answered
similar ones at the time of his capture, but he sensed from the
attitudes of the two officers that neither was impressed with the
truth of his statements. They seemed to have a preconceived
conviction concerning him that nothing which he might say could
alter.</p>

<p>"He does not look much like an Athnean," remarked the younger
man.</p>

<p>"That proves nothing," snapped the other. "Naked men look like
naked men. He might pass for your own cousin were he garbed as you
are garbed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, but why is he here? A man does not come
alone from Thenar to raid in Onthar. Unless&mdash;" he hesitated,
"unless he was sent to assassinate the queen!"</p>

<p>"I had thought of that," said the older man. "Because of what
happened to the last Athnean prisoners we took, the Athneans are
very angry with the queen. Yes, they might easily attempt to
assassinate her."</p>

<p>Tarzan was almost amused as he contemplated the ease with which
these two convinced themselves that what they wanted to believe
true, was true. But he realized that this form of one-sided trial
might prove disastrous to him if his fate were to be decided by
such a tribunal, and so he was prompted to speak.</p>

<p>"I have never been in Athne," he said quietly. "I am from a
country far to the south. An accident brought me here. I am not an
enemy. I have not come to kill your queen or any other. Until today
I did not know that your city existed." This was a long speech for
Tarzan of the Apes. He was almost positive that it would not
influence his captors, yet there was a chance that they might
believe him.</p>

<p>Men are peculiar, and none knew this better than Tarzan, who,
because he had seen rather less of men than of beasts, had been
inclined to study those whom he had seen. Now he was studying the
two men who were questioning him. The elder he judged to be a man
accustomed to the exercise of great power&mdash;cunning, ruthless,
cruel. Tarzan did not like him. His was the instinctive appraisal
of the wild beast.</p>

<p>The younger man was of an entirely different mold. He was
intelligent rather than cunning; his countenance bespoke a frank
and open nature. The ape-man judged that he was honest and
courageous.</p>

<p>While he was certain that the younger man had little authority,
compared with that exercised by his superior, yet Tarzan thought
best to address him rather than the other. He thought that he might
win an ally in the younger man and was sure that he could never
influence the elder, unless it was very much to the latter's
interests to be influenced. And so, when he spoke again, he spoke
to the younger of the two officers.</p>

<p>"Are there men of Athne like me?" he asked.</p>

<p>For an instant the officer hesitated; then he said, quite
frankly, "No, they are not like you. You are unlike any man that I
have seen."</p>

<p>"Are their weapons like my weapons?" continued the ape-man.
"There are mine over in the corner of the room; your men took them
away from me. Look at them."</p>

<p>Even the elder officer seemed interested. "Bring them here," he
ordered one of the warriors.</p>

<p>The man brought them and laid them on the table before the two
officers; the spear, the bow, the quiver of arrows, the grass rope,
and the knife. The two men picked them up one by one and examined
them carefully. Both seemed interested.</p>

<p>"Are they like the weapons of the Athneans?" demanded
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They are nothing like them," admitted the younger man. "What do
you suppose this thing is for, Tomos?" he asked his companion as he
examined Tarzan's bow.</p>

<p>"Let me take it," suggested Tarzan, "and I will show you how it
is used."</p>

<p>The younger man handed the bow to the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Gemnon," cautioned Tomos. "This may be a trick, a
subterfuge by which he hopes to get possession of a weapon with
which to kill us."</p>

<p>"He cannot kill us with that thing," replied Gemnon. "Let's see
how he uses it. Go ahead. Let's see, what did you say your name
is?"</p>

<p>"Tarzan," replied the Lord of the Jungle, "Tarzan of the
Apes."</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead, Tarzan, but see that you don't attempt to
attack any of us."</p>

<p>Tarzan stepped to the table and took an arrow from his quiver;
then he glanced about the room. On the wall at the far end a lion's
head with open mouth hung near the ceiling. With what appeared but
a single swift motion he fitted the arrow to the bow, drew the
feathered shaft to his shoulder, and released it.</p>

<p>Every eye in the room had been upon him, for the common warriors
had been interested spectators of what had been transpiring. Every
eye saw the shaft quivering now where it protruded from the center
of the lion's mouth, and an involuntary exclamation broke from
every throat, an exclamation in which were mingled surprise and
applause.</p>

<p>"Take the thing away from him, Gemnon," snapped Tomos. "It is
not a safe weapon in the hands of an enemy."</p>

<p>Tarzan tossed the bow to the table. "Do the Athneans use this
weapon?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gemnon shook his head. "We know no men who use such a weapon,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"Then you must know that I am no Athnean," stated Tarzan,
looking squarely at Tomos.</p>

<p>"It makes no difference where you are from," snapped Tomos; "you
are an enemy."</p>

<p>The ape-man shrugged but remained silent. He had accomplished
all that he had hoped for. He was sure that he had convinced them
both that he was not an Athnean and had aroused the interest of the
younger man.</p>

<p>Gemnon had leaned close to Tomos and was whispering in the
latter's ear, evidently urging some action upon him. Tarzan could
not hear what he was saying. The elder man listened impatiently; it
was clear that he was not in accord with the suggestions of his
junior.</p>

<p>"No," he said when the other had finished. "I will not permit
anything of the sort. The life of the queen is too sacred to risk
by permitting this fellow any freedom. We shall lock him up for the
night, and tomorrow decide what shall be done with him." He turned
to a warrior who seemed to be an under-officer.</p>

<p>"Take this fellow to the strong-house," he said, "and see that
he does not escape." Then he rose and strode from the room,
followed by his younger companion.</p>

<p>When they had gone, the man in whose charge Tarzan had been left
picked up the bow and examined it. "What do you call this thing?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"A bow," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"And these?"</p>

<p>"Arrows."</p>

<p>"Will they kill a man?"</p>

<p>"With them I have killed men and lions and buffaloes and
elephants," replied Tarzan. "Would you like to learn how to use
them?" Perhaps, he thought, a little kindly feeling in the
guardroom might be helpful to him later on. Just at present he was
not thinking of escape; these people and the city of gold were far
too interesting to leave until he had seen more of them.</p>

<p>The man fingering the bow hesitated. Tarzan guessed that he
wished to try his hand with the weapon but feared to delay carrying
out the order of his officer.</p>

<p>"It will take but a moment," suggested Tarzan. "See, let me show
you."</p>

<p>Half-reluctantly the man handed him the bow and Tarzan selected
another arrow.</p>

<p>"Hold them like this," he directed and placed the bow and arrow
correctly in the other's hands. "Tell your men to stand aside; you
may not shoot accurately at first. Aim at the lion's head, as I
did. Now draw the bow-string back as far as you can."</p>

<p>The man, of stocky, powerful build, tugged at the bow-string,
but the bow that Tarzan bent so easily he could scarcely bend at
all. When he released the arrow it flew but a few feet and dropped
to the floor. "What's wrong?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It requires practice," the ape-man told him.</p>

<p>"There is a trick to it," insisted the under-officer. "Let me
see you do it again."</p>

<p>The other warriors, watching with manifest interest, whispered
among themselves or commented openly.</p>

<p>"It takes a strong man to bend that stick," said one.</p>

<p>Althides, the under-officer, watched intently while Tarzan
strung the bow again and bent it; he saw how easily the stranger
flexed the heavy wood, and he marveled. The other men looked on in
open admiration, and this time a shout of approval arose as
Tarzan's second arrow crowded the first in the mouth of the
lion.</p>

<p>Althides scratched his head. "I shall have to lock you up now,"
he said, "or old Tomos will have my head on the wall of his palace,
but I shall practice with this weapon until I learn to use it. Are
you sure that there is no trick in bending that thing you call a
bow?"</p>

<p>"There is no trick to it," Tarzan assured him.</p>

<p>A guard accompanied Tarzan across the courtyard to another
building where he was placed in a room which, in the light of the
torches borne by his escort, he saw had another occupant. Then they
left him, locking the heavy door behind them.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI. &mdash; THE MAN WHO STEPPED ON A
GOD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NOW that the torches were gone the room was very
dark, but Tarzan lost no time in starting to investigate his
prison. First he groped his way to the door, which he found to be
constructed of solid planking with a small, square hole cut in it
about the height of his eyes. There was no sign of lock or latch
upon the inside and no way of ascertaining how it was secured from
the outside.</p>

<p>Leaving the door, Tarzan moved slowly along the walls, feeling
carefully over the stone surface. He knew that the other occupant
of the cell was sitting on a bench in one corner at the far end. He
could hear him breathing. As he examined the room Tarzan approached
closer and closer to his fellow prisoner.</p>

<p>In the rear wall the ape-man discovered a window. It was small
and high-set. The night was so dark that he could not tell whether
it opened onto the outdoors or into another apartment of the
building. As an avenue of escape the window appeared quite useless,
as it was much too small to accommodate the body of a man.</p>

<p>As Tarzan was examining the window he was close to the corner
where the other man sat, and now he heard a movement there. He also
noticed that the fellow's breathing had increased in rapidity, as
though he were nervous or excited. At last a voice sounded through
the darkness.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" it demanded.</p>

<p>"Examining the cell," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"It will do you no good, if you are looking for a way to
escape," said the voice. "You won't get out of here until they take
you out, no more than I shall."</p>

<p>Tarzan made no reply. There seemed nothing to say, and Tarzan
seldom speaks, even when others might find much to say. He went on
with his examination of the room. Passing the other occupant, he
felt along the fourth and last wall, but his search revealed
nothing to repay the effort. He was in a small, rectangular cell of
stone that was furnished with a long bench at one end and had a
door and a window letting into it.</p>

<p>Tarzan walked to the far end of the room and sat down upon the
bench. He was cold, wet, and hungry, but he was unafraid. He was
thinking of all that had transpired since night had fallen and left
him to the mercy of the storm; he wondered what the morrow held for
him.</p>

<p>Presently the man in the corner of the cell addressed him. "Who
are you?" he asked. "When they brought you in I saw by the light of
the torches that you are neither a Cathnean nor an Athnean." The
man's voice was coarse, his tones gruff; he demanded rather than
requested.</p>

<p>This did not please Tarzan, so he did not reply. "What's the
matter?" growled his fellow prisoner. "Are you dumb?" His voice was
raised angrily.</p>

<p>"Nor deaf," replied the ape-man. "You do not have to shout at
me."</p>

<p>The other was silent for a short time; then he spoke in an
altered tone. "We may be locked in this hole together for a long
time," he said. "We might as well be friends."</p>

<p>"As you will," replied Tarzan, his involuntary shrug passing
unnoticed in the darkness of the cell.</p>

<p>"My name is Phobeg," said the man; "what is yours?"</p>

<p>"Tarzan," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Are you either Cathnean or Athnean?"</p>

<p>"Neither. I am from a country far to the south."</p>

<p>"You would be better off had you stayed there," offered Phobeg.
"How do you happen to be here in Cathne?"</p>

<p>"I was lost," explained the ape-man, who had no intention of
telling the entire truth and thus identifying himself as a friend
of one of the Cathneans' enemies. "I was caught in the flood and
carried down the river to your city. Here they captured me and
accused me of coming to assassinate your queen."</p>

<p>"So they think you came to assassinate Nemone! Well, whether you
did come for that purpose or not will make no difference."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I mean that in any event you will be killed in one way or
another," explained Phobeg, "whatever way will best amuse
Nemone."</p>

<p>"Nemone is your queen?" inquired the ape-man indifferently.</p>

<p>"By the mane of Thoos, she is all that and more!" exclaimed
Phobeg fervently. "Such a queen there never has been in Onthar or
Thenar before nor ever will be again. By the teeth of the great
one! She makes them all stand around, the priests, the captains,
and the councilors."</p>

<p>"But why should she have me destroyed who am only a stranger
that became lost?"</p>

<p>"We keep no white men prisoners, only blacks as slaves. Now,
were you a woman you would not be killed, unless, of course, you
were too good-looking."</p>

<p>"And what would happen to a too good-looking woman?" asked
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Enough, if Nemone saw her," replied Phobeg meaningfully. "To be
more beautiful than the queen is equivalent to high treason in the
estimation of Nemone. Why, men hide their wives and daughters if
they think that they are too beautiful."</p>

<p>"What did you do to get here?" inquired the ape-man.</p>

<p>"I accidentally stepped on our god's tail," replied Phobeg
gloomily.</p>

<p>The man's strange oaths had not gone unnoticed by Tarzan and now
this latest remarkable reference to deity astounded him. But
contact with strange peoples had taught him to learn certain things
concerning them by observation and experience rather than by direct
questioning, matters of religion being chief among these. Now he
only commented, "And therefore you are being punished."</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Phobeg. "The form of my punishment has not
yet been decided. If Nemone has other amusements I may escape
punishment, or I may come through my trial successfully and be
freed, but the chances are all against me, for Nemone seldom has
sufficient bloody amusement to sate her.</p>

<p>"Of course, if she leaves the decision of my guilt or innocence
to the chances of an encounter with a single man, I shall doubtless
be successful in proving the latter, for I am very strong and there
is no better sword- or spear-man in Cathne. But I should have less
chance against a lion, while, faced by the eternal fires of
frowning Xarator, all men are guilty."</p>

<p>Although the man spoke the language Valthor had taught the
ape-man and he understood the words, the meaning of what he said
was as Greek to Tarzan. He could not quite grasp what the
amusements of the queen had to do with the administration of
justice, even though the inferences to be derived from Phobeg's
remarks seemed apparent. The conclusion was too sinister to be
entertained by the noble mind of the Lord of the Jungle.</p>

<p>He was still considering the subject and wondering about the
eternal fires of frowning Xarator when sleep overcame his physical
discomforts and merged his speculations with his dreams. To the
south, another jungle beast crouched in the shelter of a rocky
ledge while the storm that had betrayed Tarzan to new enemies
wasted its waning wrath and passed on into the nothingness that is
the sepulcher of storms. Then, as the new day dawned bright and
clear, he arose and stepped out into the sunlight, the great lion
that we have seen before, the great lion with the golden coat and
the black mane.</p>

<p>He sniffed the morning air and stretched, yawning. His sinuous
tail twitched nervously as he looked about over the vast domain
that was his because he was there, as every wilderness is the
domain of the king of beasts while his majesty is in residence.</p>

<p>From the slight elevation upon which he stood, his yellow-green
eyes surveyed a broad plain, tree-dotted. There was game there in
plenty&mdash;wildebeest, zebra, giraffe, koodoo, and
hartebeest&mdash;and the king was hungry, for the rain had
prevented his making a kill the previous night. He blinked his
yellow-green eyes in the new sunlight and strode majestically down
toward the plain and his breakfast, as, many miles to the north, a
black slave accompanied by two warriors brought breakfast to
another lord of the jungle in a prison cell at Cathne.</p>

<p><br>
At the sound of footsteps approaching his prison, Tarzan awoke and
arose from the cold stone floor where he had been sleeping. Phobeg
sat upon the edge of the wooden bench and watched the door.</p>

<p>"They bring us food or death," he said; "one never knows."</p>

<p>The ape-man made no reply. He stood there waiting until the door
swung open and the slave entered with the food in a rough earthen
bowl, and water in a glazed jug. He looked at the two warriors
standing in the open doorway and at the sunlit courtyard beyond
them. Curiosity kept him prisoner there quite as much as armed men
or sturdy door, and now he only looked beyond the two warriors who
were eying him intently. They had not been on duty the night before
and had not seen him, but they had heard of him. His feat with his
strange weapon had been told them by their fellows.</p>

<p>"So this is the wild man!" exclaimed one.</p>

<p>"You had better be careful, Phobeg," said the other. "I should
hate to be locked up in a cell with a wild man." Then, laughing at
his joke, he slammed the door after the slave had come out, and the
three went away.</p>

<p>Phobeg was appraising Tarzan with a new eye; his nakedness took
on a new meaning in the light of that descriptive term, wild man.
Phobeg noted the great height of his cell-mate, the expanse of his
chest, and his narrow hips, but he greatly under-estimated the
strength of the symmetrical muscles that flowed so smoothly beneath
the bronzed hide. Then he glanced at his own gnarled and knotted
muscles and was satisfied.</p>

<p>"So you are a wild man!" he demanded. "How wild are you?"</p>

<p>Tarzan turned slowly toward the speaker. He thought that he
recognized thinly veiled sarcasm in the tone of Phobeg's voice. For
the first time he saw his companion in the light of day. He saw a
man a few inches shorter than himself but of mighty build, a man of
great girth and bulging muscles, a man who might outweigh the Lord
of the Jungle by fifty pounds. He noted his prominent jaw, his
receding forehead, and his small eyes. In silence Tarzan regarded
Phobeg.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer me?" angrily demanded the Cathnean.</p>

<p>"Do not be a fool," admonished Tarzan. "I recall that last night
you said that as we might be confined here for a long time we might
as well be friends. We cannot be friends by insulting one another.
Food is here. Let us eat."</p>

<p>Phobeg grunted and inserted one of his big paws into the pot the
slave had brought. As there was no knife or fork or spoon, Tarzan
had no alternative but to do likewise if he wished to eat; and so
he, too, took food from the pot with his fingers. The food was
meat; it was tough and stringy and under-cooked. Had it been raw,
Tarzan had been better suited.</p>

<p>Phobeg chewed assiduously upon a mouthful of the meat until he
had reduced the fibers to a pulp that would pass down his throat.
"An old lion must have died yesterday," he remarked, "a very old
lion."</p>

<p>"If we acquire the characteristics of the creatures we eat, as
many men believe," Tarzan replied, "we should soon die of old age
on this diet."</p>

<p>"Yesterday I had a piece of goat's meat from Thenar," said
Phobeg. "It was strong and none too tender, but it was better than
this. I am accustomed to good food. In the temple the priests live
as well as the nobles do in the palace, and so the temple guard
lives well on the leavings of the priests. I was a member of the
temple guard. I was the strongest man on the guard. I am the
strongest man in Cathne. When raiders come from Thenar, or when I
am taken there on raids, the nobles marvel at my strength and
bravery. I am afraid of nothing. With my bare hands I have killed
men. Did you ever see a man like me?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is well that we should be friends," continued Phobeg,
"well for you. Everyone wants to be friends with me, for they have
learned that my enemies get their necks twisted. I take them like
this, by the head and the neck," and with his great paws he went
through a pantomime of seizing and twisting. "Then, crack! Their
spines break. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"I should think that your enemies would find that very
uncomfortable," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Uncomfortable!" ejaculated Phobeg. "Why, man, it kills
them!"</p>

<p>"At least they can no longer hear," commented the Lord of the
Jungle dryly.</p>

<p>"Of course they cannot hear; they are dead. I do not see what
that has to do with it."</p>

<p>"That does not surprise me," Tarzan assured him.</p>

<p>"What does not surprise you?" demanded Phobeg. "That they are
dead, or that they cannot hear?"</p>

<p>"I am not easily surprised by anything," explained the
ape-man.</p>

<p>Beneath his low forehead Phobeg's brows were knitted in thought.
He scratched his head. "What were we talking about?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"We were trying to decide which would be more terrible,"
explained Tarzan patiently, "to have you for a friend or an
enemy."</p>

<p>Phobeg looked at his companion for a long time. One could almost
see the laborious effort of thinking going on inside that thick
skull. Then he shook his head. "That is not what we were talking
about at all," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"Now I have forgotten. I never saw anyone as stupid as you. When
they called you a wild man they must have meant a crazy man. And I
have got to remain locked in here with you, for no one knows how
long."</p>

<p>"You can always get rid of me," said Tarzan quite seriously.</p>

<p>"How can I get rid of you?" demanded the Cathnean.</p>

<p>"You can twist my neck, like this." Tarzan mimicked the
pantomime in which Phobeg had explained how he rid himself of his
enemies.</p>

<p>"I could do it," boasted Phobeg, "but then they would kill me.
No, I shall let you live."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Or at least while we are locked up here together," added
Phobeg.</p>

<p>Loss of liberty represented for Tarzan, as it does for all
creatures endowed with brains, the acme of misery, more to be
avoided than physical pain; yet, with stoic fortitude he accepted
his fate without a murmur of protest, and while his body was
confined in four walls of stone, his memories roved the jungle and
the veldt and lived again the freedom and the experience of the
past.</p>

<p>He recalled the days of his childhood when fierce Kala, the
she-ape that had suckled him at her hairy breast in his infancy,
had protected him from the dangers of their savage life. He
recalled her gentleness and her patience with this backward child
who must still be carried in her arms long after the balus of her
companion shes were able to scurry through the trees seeking their
own food and even able to protect themselves against their enemies
by flight if nothing more.</p>

<p>These were his first impressions of life, dating back perhaps to
his second year while he was still unable to swing through the
trees or even make much progress upon the ground. After that he had
developed rapidly, far more rapidly than a pampered child of
civilization, for upon the quick development of his cunning and his
strength depended his life.</p>

<p>With a faint smile he recalled the rage of old Tublat, his
foster father, when Tarzan had deliberately undertaken to annoy
him. Old "Broken-nose" had always hated Tarzan because the
helplessness of his long-drawn infancy had prevented Kala from
bearing other apes. Tublat had argued in the meager language of the
apes that Tarzan was a weakling that would never become strong
enough or clever enough to be of value to the tribe. He wanted
Tarzan killed, and he tried to get old Kerchak, the king, to decree
his death; so when Tarzan grew old enough to understand, he hated
Tublat and sought to annoy him in every way that he could.</p>

<p>His memories of those days brought only smiles now, save only
the great tragedy of his life, the death of Kala. But that had
occurred later, when he was almost a grown man. She had been saved
to him while he needed her most and not taken away until after he
was amply able to fend for himself and meet the other denizens of
the jungle upon an equal footing. But it was not the protection of
those great arms and mighty fangs that he had missed, that he still
missed even today; he had missed the maternal love of that savage
heart, the only mother-love that he had ever known.</p>

<p>And now his thoughts turned naturally to other friends of the
jungle of whom Kala had been first and greatest. There were his
many friends among the great apes; there was Tantor the elephant;
there was Jad-bal-ja the Golden Lion; there was little Nkima. Poor
little Nkima! Much to his disgust and amid loud howls, Nkima had
been left behind this time when Tarzan set out upon his journey
into the north country. The little monkey had contracted a cold and
the ape-man did not wish to expose him to the closing rains of the
rainy season.</p>

<p>Tarzan regretted a little that he had not brought Jad-bal-ja
with him, for though he could do very well for considerable periods
without the companionship of man, he often missed that of the wild
beasts that were his friends. Of course the Golden Lion was
sometimes an embarrassing companion when one was in contact with
human beings, but he was a loyal friend and good company, for only
occasionally did he break the silence.</p>

<p>Tarzan recalled the day that he had captured the tiny cub. What
a cub he had been! All lion from the very first. Tarzan sighed as
he thought of the days that he and the Golden Lion had hunted and
fought together.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII. &mdash; NEMONE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN had thought, when he went without objection
into the prison cell at Cathne, that the next morning he would be
questioned and released, or at least be taken from the cell. Once
out of the cell again, Tarzan had no intention of returning to it,
the Lord of the Jungle being very certain of his prowess.</p>

<p>But they had not let him out the next morning nor the next nor
the next. Perhaps he might have made a break for liberty when food
was brought, but each time he thought that the next day would bring
his release, and waited.</p>

<p>Phobeg had been imprisoned longer than had Tarzan, and the
confinement was making him moody. Sometimes he sat for hours
staring at the floor; at other times he would mumble to himself,
carrying on long conversations which were always bitter and that
usually resulted in working him up into a rage. Then he might seek
to vent his spleen upon Tarzan. The fact that Tarzan remained
silent under such provocation increased Phobeg's ire, but it also
prevented an actual break between them, for it is still a fact,
however trite the saying, that it takes two to make a quarrel.
Tarzan would not quarrel; at least, not yet.</p>

<p>"Nemone won't get much entertainment out of you," growled Phobeg
this morning after one of his tirades had elicited no response from
the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Well, even so," replied Tarzan, "you should more than make up
to her any amusement value that I may lack."</p>

<p>"That I will!" exclaimed Phobeg. "If it is fighting she wants,
she shall see such fighting as she has never seen before when she
matches Phobeg with either man or beast. But you! Bah! She will
have to pit you against some half-grown child if she wishes to see
any fight at all. You have no courage; your veins are filled with
water. If she is wise she will dump you into Xarator. By Thoos's
tail! I should like to see you there. I'll bet my best habergeon
they could hear you scream in Athne."</p>

<p>The ape-man was standing gazing at the little rectangle of sky
that he could see through the small barred opening in the door. He
remained silent after Phobeg had ceased speaking, totally ignoring
him as though he did not exist. Phobeg became furious. He rose from
the bench upon which he had been sitting.</p>

<p>"Coward!" he cried. "Why don't you answer me? By the yellow
fangs of Thoos! I've a mind to beat some manners into you, so that
you will know enough to answer when your betters speak." He took a
step in the direction of the ape-man.</p>

<p>Slowly Tarzan turned toward the angry man, his level gaze fixed
upon the other's eyes, and waited. He said nothing, but his
attitude was an open book that even the stupid Phobeg could read.
And Phobeg hesitated.</p>

<p>Just what might have happened no man may know, for at that
instant four warriors came and swung the door of the cell open.
"Come with us," said one of them, "both of you."</p>

<p>Phobeg sullenly, Tarzan with the savage dignity of Numa,
accompanied the four warriors across the open courtyard and through
a doorway that led into a long corridor, at the end of which they
were ushered into a large room. Here, behind a table, sat seven
warriors trapped in ivory and gold. Among them Tarzan recognized
the two who had questioned him the night of his capture, old Tomos
and the younger Gemnon.</p>

<p>"These are nobles," whispered Phobeg to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That one at the center of the table is old Tomos, the queen's
councilor. He would like to marry the queen, but I guess he is too
old to suit her. The one on his right is Erot. He used to be a
common warrior like me, but Nemone took a fancy to him, and now he
is the queen's favorite. She won't marry him though, for he is not
of noble blood. The young fellow on Tomos's left is Gemnon. He is
from an old and noble family. Warriors who have served him say he
is a very decent sort."</p>

<p>As Phobeg gossiped, the two prisoners and their guard had been
standing just inside the doorway waiting to be summoned to advance,
and Tarzan had had an opportunity to note the architecture and
furnishings of the room. The ceiling was low and was supported by a
series of engaged columns at regular intervals about the four
walls. Between the columns, along one side of the room behind the
table at which the nobles were seated, were unglazed windows, and
there were three doorways: that through which Tarzan and Phobeg had
been brought, which was directly opposite the windows, and one at
either side of the room.</p>

<p>The floor was of stone, composed of many pieces of different
shapes and sizes, but all so nicely fitted that joints were barely
discernible. On the floor were a few rugs either of the skins of
lions or of a stiff and heavy wool weave.</p>

<p>But now Tarzan's examination of the room was interrupted by the
voice of Tomos. "Bring the prisoners forward," he directed the
under-officer who was one of the four warriors escorting them.</p>

<p>When the two men had been halted upon the opposite side of the
table from the nobles, Tomos pointed at Tarzan's companion.</p>

<p>"Which is this one?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"He is called Phobeg," replied the under-officer.</p>

<p>"What is the charge against him?"</p>

<p>"He profaned Thoos."</p>

<p>"Who brought the charge?"</p>

<p>"The high priest."</p>

<p>"It was an accident," Phobeg hastened to explain. "I meant no
disrespect."</p>

<p>"Silence!" snapped Tomos. Then he pointed at Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And this one?" he demanded. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"This is the one who calls himself Tarzan," explained Gemnon.
"You will recall that you and I examined him the night he was
captured."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Tomos. "I recall. He carried some sort of
strange weapon."</p>

<p>"Is he the man of whom you told me," asked Erot, "the one who
came from Athne to assassinate the queen?"</p>

<p>"This is the one," replied Tomos.</p>

<p>"He does not greatly resemble an Athnean," commented Erot.</p>

<p>"I am not," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Silence!" commanded Tomos.</p>

<p>"Why should I be silent?" demanded Tarzan. "There is none other
to speak for me than myself; therefore I shall speak for myself. I
am no enemy of your people, nor are my people at war with yours. I
demand my liberty!"</p>

<p>"He demands his liberty," mimicked Erot and laughed aloud as
though it was a good joke. "The slave demands his liberty!"</p>

<p>Tomos half rose from his seat, his face purple with rage. He
banged the table with his fist. He pointed a finger at Tarzan.
"Speak when you are spoken to, slave, and not otherwise."</p>

<p>"It is evident that he is a man from a far country," interjected
Gemnon. "It is not strange that he neither understands our customs
nor recognizes the great among us. Perhaps we should listen to him.
If he is not an Athnean and no enemy, why should we imprison him or
punish him?"</p>

<p>"He came over the palace walls at night," retorted Tomos. "He
could have come for but one purpose, to kill our queen; therefore,
he must die."</p>

<p>"He told us that the river washed him down to Cathne," persisted
Gemnon. "It was a very dark night and he did not know where he was
when he finally succeeded in crawling ashore; it was only chance
that brought him to the palace."</p>

<p>"A pretty story but not plausible," countered Erot.</p>

<p>"Why not plausible?" demanded Gemnon. "I think it quite
plausible. We know that no man could have swum the river in the
flood that was raging that night, and that this man could not have
reached the spot at which he climbed the wall except by swimming
the river or crossing the bridge of gold. We know that he did not
cross the bridge, because the bridge was well-guarded and no one
crossed that night. Knowing therefore that he did not cross the
bridge and could not have swum the river, we know that the only way
he could have reached that particular spot upon the river's bank
was by being swept downstream from above. I believe his story, and
I believe that we should treat him as an honorable warrior from
some distant kingdom until we have better reasons than we now have
for believing otherwise."</p>

<p>"I should not care to be the one to defend a man who came here
to kill the queen," sneered Erot meaningfully.</p>

<p>"Enough of this!" said Tomos curtly. "The man shall be judged
fairly and destroyed as Nemone thinks best."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, a door at one end of the room opened and
a noble resplendent in ivory and gold stepped into the chamber.
Halting just within the threshold, he faced the nobles at the
table.</p>

<p>"The queen!" he announced in a loud voice and then stepped
aside.</p>

<p>All eyes turned in the direction of the doorway and at the same
time the nobles rose to their feet and then knelt upon the floor,
facing the doorway through which the queen would enter. The
warriors on guard, including those with Tarzan and Phobeg, did
likewise. Phobeg following their example. Everyone in the room
knelt except the noble who had announced the queen, or rather every
Cathnean. Tarzan of the Apes did not kneel.</p>

<p>"Down, jackal!" growled one of the guards in a whisper, and then
amidst deathly silence a woman stepped into view and paused, framed
in the carved casing of the doorway. Regal, she stood there
glancing indolently about the apartment; then her eyes met those of
the ape-man and, for a moment, held there on his. A slight frown of
puzzlement contracted her straight brows as she continued on into
the room, approaching the table and the kneeling men.</p>

<p>Behind her followed a half-dozen richly arrayed nobles,
resplendent in burnished gold and gleaming ivory, but as they
crossed the chamber Tarzan saw only the gorgeous figure of the
queen. She was clothed more simply than her escort, but she was far
more beautiful than the crude Phobeg had ever painted her.</p>

<p>A narrow diadem set with red stones encircled her brow,
confining her glossy black hair. Upon either side of her head,
covering her ears, a large golden disc depended from the diadem,
while from its rear rose a slender filament of gold that curved
forward, supporting a large red stone above the center of her head.
About her throat was a simple golden band that held a brooch and
pendant of ivory in the soft hollow of her neck. Upon her upper
arms were similar golden bands supporting triangular, curved
ornaments of ivory.</p>

<p>That she was marvelously beautiful by the standards of any land
or any time grew more apparent to the Lord of the Jungle as she
came nearer to him; yet her presence exhaled a subtle essence that
left him wondering if her beauty were the reflection of a nature
all good or all evil, for her mien and bearing suggested that there
could be no compromise&mdash;Nemone, the queen, was all one or all
the other.</p>

<p>She kept her eyes upon him as she crossed the room slowly, and
Tarzan did not drop his own from hers.</p>

<p>The quizzical frown still furrowed Nemone's smooth brow as she
reached the end of the table where the nobles knelt. It was not an
angry frown, and there might have been in it much of interest and
something of amusement, for unusual things interested and amused
Nemone, so rare were they in the monotony of her life. It was
certainly unusual to see one who did not accord her the homage due
a queen.</p>

<p>As she halted she turned her eyes upon the kneeling nobles.
"Arise!" she commanded, and in that single word the vibrant
qualities of her rich, deep voice sent a strange thrill through the
ape-man. "Who is this that does not kneel to Nemone?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>As Tarzan had been standing behind the nobles as they had turned
to face Nemone when they knelt, only two of his guards had been
aware of his dereliction. Now as they arose and faced about, their
countenances were filled with horror and rage when they discovered
that the strange captive had so affronted their queen.</p>

<p>Tomos went purple again. He spluttered with rage. "He is an
ignorant and impudent savage, my queen," he said, "but as he is
about to die, his actions are of no consequence."</p>

<p>"Why is he about to die," demanded Nemone, "and how is he to
die?"</p>

<p>"He is to die because he came here in the dead of night to
assassinate your majesty," explained Tomos; "the manner of his
death rests, of course, in the hands of our gracious queen."</p>

<p>Nemone's dark eyes, veiled behind long lashes, appraised the
ape-man, lingering upon his bronzed skin and the rolling contours
of his muscles, then rising to the handsome face until her eyes met
his. "Why did you not kneel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why should I kneel to you who they have said will have me
killed?" demanded Tarzan. "Why should I kneel to you who are not my
queen? Why should I, Tarzan of the Apes, who kneels to no one,
kneel to you?"</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried Tomos. "Your impertinence knows no bounds. Do
you not realize, ignorant slave, low savage, that you are
addressing Nemone, the queen!"</p>

<p>Tarzan made no reply; he did not even look at Tomos; his eyes
were fixed upon Nemone. She fascinated him, but whether as a thing
of beauty or a thing of evil, he did not know.</p>

<p>Tomos turned to the under-officer in command of the escort that
was guarding Tarzan and Phobeg. "Take them away!" he snapped. "Take
them back to their cell until we are ready to destroy them."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Nemone. "I would know more of this man," and then
she turned to Tarzan. "So you came to kill me!" Her voice was
smooth, almost caressing. At the moment the woman reminded Tarzan
of a cat that is playing with its victim. "Perhaps they chose a
good man for the purpose; you look as though you might be equal to
any feat of arms."</p>

<p>"Killing a woman is no feat of arms," replied Tarzan. "I do not
kill women. I did not come here to kill you."</p>

<p>"Then why did you come to Onthar?" inquired the queen in her
silky voice.</p>

<p>"That I have already explained twice to that old man with the
red face," replied Tarzan, nodding in the general direction of
Tomos. "Ask him; I am tired of explaining to people who have
already decided to kill me."</p>

<p>Tomos trembled with rage and half drew his slender, dagger-like
sword.</p>

<p>Nemone had flushed angrily at Tarzan's words, but she did not
lose control of herself. "Sheath your sword, Tomos," she commanded
icily. "Nemone is competent to decide when she is affronted and
what steps to take. The fellow is indeed impertinent, but it seems
to me that if he affronted anyone, it was Tomos he affronted and
not Nemone. However, his temerity shall not go unpunished. Who is
this other?"</p>

<p>"He is a temple guard named Phobeg," explained Erot. "He
profaned Thoos."</p>

<p>"It would amuse us," said Nemone, "to see these two men fight
upon the Field of the Lions. Let them fight without other weapons
than those which Thoos has given them. To the victor, freedom," she
hesitated momentarily, "freedom within limits. Take them away!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; UPON THE FIELD OF THE
LIONS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN and Phobeg were back in their little stone
cell; the ape-man had not escaped. He had had no opportunity to
escape on the way back to his prison, for the warriors who guarded
him had redoubled their vigilance.</p>

<p>Phobeg was moody and thoughtful. The attitude of his fellow
prisoner during their examination by the nobles, his seeming
indifference to the majesty and power of Nemone, had tended to
alter Phobeg's former estimate of the ape-man's courage. He
realized now that the fellow was either a very brave man or a very
great fool, and he hoped that he was the latter.</p>

<p>Phobeg was stupid, but past experience had taught him something
of the psychology of mortal combat. He knew that when a man went
into battle fearing his antagonist, he was already handicapped and
partly defeated. Now Phobeg did not fear Tarzan; he was too stupid
and too ignorant to anticipate fear.</p>

<p>Tarzan, on the other hand, was of an entirely different
temperament, and though he never knew fear it was for a very
different reason. Being intelligent and imaginative, he could
visualize all the possibilities of an impending encounter, but he
could never know fear, because death held no terrors for him. He
had learned to suffer physical pain without the usually attendant
horrors of mental anguish.</p>

<p>"It will doubtless be tomorrow," said Phobeg grimly.</p>

<p>"What will be tomorrow?" inquired the ape-man.</p>

<p>"The combat in which I shall kill you," explained the cheerful
Phobeg.</p>

<p>"Oh, so you are going to kill me! Phobeg, I am surprised. I
thought that you were my friend." Tarzan's tone was serious, though
a brighter man than Phobeg might have discovered in it a note of
banter. But Phobeg was not bright at all, and he thought that
Tarzan was already commencing to throw himself upon his mercy.</p>

<p>"It will soon be over," Phobeg assured him. "I promise that I
shall not let you suffer long."</p>

<p>"I suppose that you will twist my neck like this," said Tarzan,
pretending to twist something with his two hands.</p>

<p>"M-m-m, perhaps," admitted Phobeg, "but I shall have to throw
you about a bit first. We must amuse Nemone, you know."</p>

<p>"Surely, by all means!" assented Tarzan. "But suppose you should
not be able to throw me about? Suppose that I should throw you
about? Would that amuse Nemone? Or perhaps it would amuse you!"</p>

<p>Phobeg laughed. "It amuses me very much just to think about it,"
he said, "and I hope that it amuses you to think about it, for that
is as near as you will ever come to throwing Phobeg about. Have I
not told you that I am the strongest man in Cathne?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," admitted Tarzan. "I had forgotten that for the
moment."</p>

<p>"You would do well to try to remember it," advised Phobeg, "or
otherwise our combat will not be interesting at all."</p>

<p>"And Nemone would not be amused! That would be sad. We should
make it as interesting and exciting as possible, and you must not
conclude it too soon."</p>

<p>"You are right about that," agreed Phobeg. "The better it is the
more generous will Nemone feel toward me when it is over. She may
even give me a donation in addition to my liberty if we amuse her
well.</p>

<p>"By the belly of Thoos!" he exclaimed, slapping his thigh. "We
must make a good fight of it and a long one. Now listen! How would
this be? At first we shall pretend that you are defeating me; I
shall let you throw me about a bit. You see? Then I shall get the
better of it for a while, and then you. We shall take turns up to a
certain point, and then, when I give you the cue, you must pretend
to be frightened, and run away from me. I shall then chase you all
over the arena, and that will give them a good laugh. When I catch
you at last (and you must let me catch you right in front of
Nemone), I shall then twist your neck and kill you, but I will do
it as painlessly as possible."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Tarzan grimly.</p>

<p>"Do you like the plan?" demanded Phobeg.</p>

<p>"It will certainly amuse them," agreed Tarzan, "if it
works."</p>

<p>"If it works! Why should it not work? It will, if you do your
part."</p>

<p>"But suppose I kill you?" inquired the Lord of the Jungle.</p>

<p>"There you go again!" exclaimed Phobeg. "I must say that you are
a good fellow after all, for you will have your little joke. And I
can tell you that there is no one who enjoys a little joke more
than Phobeg."</p>

<p>"I hope that you are in the same mood tomorrow," remarked
Tarzan.</p>

<p><br>
When the next day dawned, the slave and the guard came with a large
breakfast for the two prisoners, the best meal that had been served
them since they had been imprisoned.</p>

<p>"Eat well," advised one of the warriors, "that you may have
strength to fight a good fight for the entertainment of the queen.
For one of you it is the last meal, so you had both better enjoy it
to the full, since there is no telling for which one of you it is
the last."</p>

<p>"It is the last for him," said Phobeg, jerking a thumb in the
direction of Tarzan.</p>

<p>"It is thus that the betting goes," said the warrior, "but even
so, one cannot always be sure. The stranger is a large man, and he
looks strong."</p>

<p>An hour later a large detachment of warriors came and took
Tarzan and Phobeg from the prison. They led them through the palace
grounds and out into an avenue bordered by old trees.</p>

<p>Here were throngs of people waiting to see the start of the
pageant, and companies of warriors standing at ease, leaning upon
their spears. It was an interesting sight to Tarzan who had been so
long confined in the gloomy prison.</p>

<p>Tarzan and Phobeg were escorted west along the avenue, and as
they passed, the crowd commented upon them.</p>

<p>At the end of the avenue Tarzan saw the great bridge of gold
that spanned the river. It was a splendid structure built entirely
of the precious metal. Two golden lions of heroic size flanked the
approach from the city, and as he was led across the bridge the
ape-man saw two identical lions guarding the western end.</p>

<p>Out upon the plain that is called the Field of the Lions a crowd
of spectators was filing toward a point about a mile from the city
where many people were congregated, and toward this assemblage the
detachment escorted the two gladiators. Here was a large, oval
arena excavated to a depth of twenty or thirty feet in the floor of
the plain. Upon the excavated earth piled symmetrically around the
edges of the pit, and terraced from the plain level to the top,
were arranged slabs of stone to serve as seats. At the east end of
the arena was a wide ramp descending into it. Spanning the ramp was
a low arch surmounted by the loges of the queen and high
nobility.</p>

<p>As Tarzan passed beneath the arch and descended the ramp toward
the arena he saw that nearly half the seats were already taken. The
people were eating food that they had brought with them, and there
was much laughter and talking. Evidently it was a gala day.</p>

<p>The warriors conducted the two men to the far end of the arena
where a terrace had been cut part way up the sloping side of the
arena, a wooden ladder leaning against the wall giving access to
it. Here, upon this terrace, Tarzan and Phobeg were installed with
a few warriors to serve as guards.</p>

<p>Presently, from the direction of the city, Tarzan heard the
music of drums and trumpets.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" cried Phobeg.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The queen and the lion men," replied his adversary.</p>

<p>"What are the lion men?" inquired Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They are the nobles," explained Phobeg. "Really only the
hereditary nobles are members of the clan of lions, but we usually
speak of all nobles as lion men. Erot is a noble because Nemone has
created him one, but he is not a lion man, as he was not born a
noble."</p>

<p>Now the blaring of the trumpets and the beating of the drums
burst with increased volume upon their ears, and Tarzan saw that
the musicians were marching down the ramp into the arena at the far
end of the great oval.</p>

<p>Behind the music marched a company of warriors, and from each
spearhead fluttered a colored pennon. It was a stirring and
colorful picture but nothing to what followed.</p>

<p>A few yards to the rear of the warriors came a chariot of gold
drawn by four maned lions, where, half-reclining upon a couch
draped with furs and gaily colored cloths, rode Nemone, the queen.
Sixteen black slaves held the lions in leash, and at either side of
the chariot marched six nobles resplendent in gold and ivory, while
a huge black, marching behind, held a great red parasol over the
queen; squatting upon little seats above the rear wheels of the
chariot were two small blackamoors with feathered fans above
her.</p>

<p>At sight of the chariot and its royal occupant the people in the
stands arose and then knelt down in salute to their ruler, while
wave after wave of applause rolled round the amphitheater as the
pageant slowly circled the arena.</p>

<p>Behind Nemone's chariot marched another company of warriors.
These were followed by a number of gorgeously decorated wooden
chariots, each drawn by two lions and driven by a noble, and
following these marched a company of nobles on foot, while a third
company of warriors brought up the rear.</p>

<p>When the column had circled the arena, Nemone quit her chariot
and ascended to her loge above the ramp amid the continued cheering
of the populace, the chariots driven by the nobles lined up in the
center of the arena, the royal guard formed across the entrance to
the stadium, and the nobles who had no part in the games went to
their private loges.</p>

<p>There followed then in quick succession contests in dagger
throwing and in the throwing of spears, feats of strength and
skill, and foot races.</p>

<p>When the minor sports were completed the chariot races began.
Two drivers raced in each event, the distance being always the
same, one lap of the arena, for lions cannot maintain high speed
for great distances. After each race the winner received a pennon
from the queen, while the loser drove up the ramp and out of the
stadium amid the hoots of the spectators. Then two more raced, and
when the last pair had finished the winners paired off for new
events. Thus, by elimination, the contestants were eventually
reduced to two, winners in each event in which they had contested.
This, then, was the premiere racing event of the day.</p>

<p>The winner of this final race was acclaimed champion of the day
and was presented with a golden helmet by Nemone herself, and the
crowd gave him a mighty ovation as he drove proudly around the
arena and disappeared up the ramp beneath the arch of the queen,
his golden helmet shining bravely in the sun.</p>

<p>"Now," said Phobeg in a loud voice, "the people are going to see
something worth while. It is what they have been waiting for, and
they will not be disappointed. If you have a god, fellow, pray to
him, for you are about to die."</p>

<p>"Are you not going to permit me to run around the arena first
while you chase me?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9">IX. &mdash; "DEATH! DEATH!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A SCORE of slaves were busily cleaning up the
arena following the departure of the lion-drawn chariots, the
audience was standing and stretching itself, nobles were wandering
from loge to loge visiting their friends. The sounds of many voices
enveloped the stadium in one mighty discord. The period was one of
intermission between events.</p>

<p>Now a trumpet sounded, and the warriors guarding Tarzan and
Phobeg ordered them down into the arena and paraded them once
around it that the people might compare the gladiators and choose a
favorite. As they passed before the royal loge, Nemone leaned
forward with half-closed eyes surveying the tall stranger and the
squat Cathnean.</p>

<p>The two men were posted in the arena a short distance from the
royal loge, and the captain of the stadium was giving them their
instructions which were extremely simple: they were to remain
inside the arena and try to kill one another with their bare hands,
though the use of elbows, knees, feet, or teeth was not barred.
There were no other rules governing the combat. The winner was to
receive his freedom, though even this had been qualified by
Nemone.</p>

<p>"When the trumpet sounds you may attack," said the captain of
the stadium. "And may Thoos be with you."</p>

<p>Tarzan and Phobeg had been placed ten paces apart.</p>

<p>Now they stood waiting the signal. Phobeg swelled his chest and
beat upon it with his fists; he flexed his arms, swelling the great
muscles of his biceps until they stood out like great knotty balls;
then he hopped about, warming up his leg muscles. He was attracting
all the attention, and that pleased him excessively.</p>

<p>Tarzan stood quietly, his arms folded loosely across his chest,
his muscles relaxed. He appeared totally unconscious of the
presence of the noisy multitude or even of Phobeg, but he was not
unconscious of anything that was transpiring about him. His eyes
and his ears were alert; it would be Tarzan who would hear the
first note of the trumpet's signal. Tarzan was ready!</p>

<p>The trumpet pealed, and Tarzan's eyes swung back to Phobeg. A
strange silence fell upon the amphitheater. The two men approached
one another, Phobeg strutting and confident, Tarzan with the easy,
graceful stride of a lion.</p>

<p>"Say your prayers, fellow!" shouted the temple guard. "I am
going to kill you, but first I shall play with you for the
amusement of Nemone."</p>

<p>Phobeg came closer and reached for Tarzan. The ape-man let him
seize him by the shoulders; then Tarzan cupped his two hands and
brought the heels of them up suddenly and with great force beneath
Phobeg's chin and at the same time pushed the man from him. The
great head snapped back, and the fellow's huge bulk hurtled
backward a dozen paces, where Phobeg sat down heavily. A groan of
surprise arose from the audience. Phobeg scrambled to his feet. His
face was contorted with rage; in an instant he had gone berserk.
With a roar, he charged the ape-man.</p>

<p>"No quarter!" he screamed. "I kill you now!"</p>

<p>"Don't you wish to throw me about a bit first?" asked Tarzan in
a low voice, as he lightly side-stepped the other's mad charge.</p>

<p>"No!" screamed Phobeg, turning clumsily and charging again. "I
kill! I kill!"</p>

<p>Tarzan caught the outstretched hands and spread them wide; then
a bronzed arm, lightning-like, clamped about Phobeg's short neck.
The ape-man wheeled suddenly about, leaned forward, and hurled his
antagonist over his head. Phobeg fell heavily to the sandy gravel
of the arena.</p>

<p>Nemone leaned from the royal loge, her eyes flashing, her bosom
heaving. Phobeg arose but this time more slowly, nor did he charge
again, but approached his antagonist warily. His tactics now were
very different from what they had been. He wanted to get close
enough to Tarzan to get a hold; that was all he desired, just a
hold; then, he knew, he could crush the man with his great
strength.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ape-man sensed what was in the mind of his foe,
perhaps it was just chance that caused him to taunt Phobeg by
holding his left wrist out to the other. Whatever it was, Phobeg
seized upon the opportunity and, grasping Tarzan's wrist, sought to
drag the ape-man into his embrace. Tarzan stepped in quickly,
struck Phobeg a terrific blow in the face with his right fist,
seized the wrist of the hand that held his, and, again whirling
quickly beneath his victim, threw him heavily once more, using
Phobeg's arm as a lever and his own shoulder as a fulcrum.</p>

<p>This time Phobeg had difficulty in arising at all. He came up
slowly. The ape-man was standing over him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tarzan stooped and seized Phobeg, and, lifting him
bodily, held him above his head. "Shall I run now, Phobeg," he
growled, "or are you too tired to chase me?" Then he hurled the man
to the ground again a little nearer to the royal loge where Nemone
sat, tense and thrilled.</p>

<p>Like a lion with its prey, the Lord of the Jungle followed the
man who had taunted him and would have killed him; twice again he
picked him up and hurled him closer to the end of the arena. Now
the fickle crowd was screaming to Tarzan to kill
Phobeg&mdash;Phobeg, the strongest man in Cathne.</p>

<p>Again Tarzan seized his antagonist and held him above his head.
Phobeg struggled weakly, but he was quite helpless. Tarzan walked
to the side of the arena near the royal loge and hurled the great
body up into the audience.</p>

<p>"Take your strong man," he said; "Tarzan does not want him."
Then he walked away and stood before the ramp, waiting, as though
he demanded his freedom.</p>

<p>Amid shrieks and howls that called to Tarzan's mind only the
foulest of wild beasts, the loathsome hyena, the crowd hurled the
unhappy Phobeg back into the arena. "Kill him! Kill him!" they
screamed.</p>

<p>Nemone leaned from her loge. "Kill him, Tarzan!" she cried.</p>

<p>"I shall not kill him," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>Nemone arose in her loge. She was flushed and excited. "Tarzan!"
she cried, and when the ape-man glanced up at her, "Why do you not
kill him?"</p>

<p>"Why should I kill him?" he demanded. "He cannot harm me, and I
kill only in self-defense or for food." Phobeg, bruised, battered,
and helpless, arose weakly to his feet and stood reeling drunkenly.
He heard the voice of the pitiless mob screaming for his death. He
saw his antagonist standing a few paces away in front of the ramp,
paying no attention to him, and dimly and as though from a great
distance he had heard him refuse to kill him. He had heard, but he
did not comprehend.</p>

<p>"Kill him, fellow!" Erot cried. "It's the queen's command."</p>

<p>The ape-man glanced up at the queen's favorite.</p>

<p>"Tarzan kills only whom it pleases him to kill." He spoke in a
low voice that yet carried to the royal loge. "I shall not kill
Phobeg."</p>

<p>"You fool," cried Erot, "do you not understand that it is the
queen's wish, that it is the queen's command, which no one may
disobey and live, that you kill the fellow?"</p>

<p>"If the queen wants him killed, why doesn't she send you down to
do it? She is your queen, not mine." There was neither awe nor
respect in the voice of the ape-man.</p>

<p>Erot looked horrified. He glanced at the queen. "Shall I order
the guard to destroy the impudent savage?" he asked.</p>

<p>Nemone shook her head. Her countenance remained inscrutable, but
a strange light burned in her eyes. "We give them both their
lives," she said. "Set Phobeg free, and bring the other to me in
the palace."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; IN THE PALACE OF THE
QUEEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A DETACHMENT of common warriors commanded by an
under-officer had escorted Tarzan to the stadium, but he returned
to the city in the company of nobles.</p>

<p>Congratulating him upon his victory, praising his prowess,
asking innumerable questions, they followed him from the arena, and
at the top of the ramp another noble accosted him. It was
Gemnon.</p>

<p>"The queen has commanded me to accompany you to the city and
look after you," he explained. "This evening I am to bring you to
her in the palace, but in the meantime you will want to bathe and
rest, and I imagine that you might welcome some decent food after
the prison fare you have been eating recently."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad of a bath and good food," replied Tarzan, "but
why should I rest? I have been doing nothing else for several
days."</p>

<p>"But you have just come through a terrific battle for your
life!" exclaimed Gemnon. "You must be tired."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged his broad shoulders. "Perhaps you had better
look after Phobeg instead," he replied. "It is he who needs rest; I
am not tired."</p>

<p>Gemnon laughed. "Phobeg should consider himself lucky to be
alive. If anyone looks after him, it will be himself."</p>

<p>They were walking toward the city now. The other nobles had
joined their own parties or had dropped behind, and Gemnon and
Tarzan were alone, if two may be said to be alone who are
surrounded by a chattering mob through which bodies of armed men
and lion-drawn chariots are making their slow way.</p>

<p>"You are popular now," commented Gemnon.</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago they were screaming at Phobeg to kill me,"
Tarzan reminded him.</p>

<p>"I am really surprised that they are so friendly," remarked
Gemnon. "You cheated them of a death, the one thing they are all
hoping to see when they go to the stadium. It is for this they pay
their lepta for admission."</p>

<p>When they reached the city, Gemnon took Tarzan to his own
quarters in the palace. These consisted of a bedroom and bath in
addition to a living room that was shared with another officer.
Here Tarzan found the usual decorations of weapons and shields, in
addition to pictures painted on leather. He saw no books, nor any
other printed matter; neither was there any sign of writing
materials in the rooms. He wanted to question Gemnon on this
subject, but he found that he had never learned any word for
writing or for a written language.</p>

<p>The bath interested the ape-man. The tub was a coffin-like
affair made of clay and baked. The plumbing fixtures were
apparently all of solid gold. While questioning Gemnon he learned
that the water was brought from the mountains east of the city
through clay pipes of considerable size and distributed by means of
pressure tanks distributed throughout all of urban Cathne. Gemnon
summoned a slave to prepare the bath, and when Tarzan had finished,
a meal was awaiting him in the living room. While he was eating,
and Gemnon lounged near in conversation, another young noble
entered the apartment. He had a narrow face and rather unpleasant
eyes, nor was he overly cordial when Gemnon introduced him to
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Xerstle and I are quartered together," Gemnon explained.</p>

<p>"I have orders to move out," snapped Xerstle.</p>

<p>"Why is that?" asked Gemnon.</p>

<p>"To make room for your friend here," replied Xerstle sourly, and
then he went into his own room mumbling something about slaves and
savages.</p>

<p>"He does not seem pleased," remarked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But I am," replied Gemnon in a low voice. "Xerstle and I have
not gotten along well together. We have nothing in common. He is
one of Erot's friends and was elevated from nothing after Erot
became Nemone's favourite. He is the son of a foreman at the mines.
If they had elevated his father he would have been an acquisition
to the nobility, for he is a splendid man, but Xerstle is a
rat&mdash;like his friend, Erot."</p>

<p>"I have heard something of your nobility," said Tarzan. "I
understand that there are two classes of nobles, and that one class
rather looks upon the other with contempt even though a man of the
lower class may hold a higher title than many of those in the other
class."</p>

<p>"We do not look upon them with contempt if they are worthy men,"
replied Gemnon. "The old nobility, the lion men of Cathne, is
hereditary; the other is but temporary&mdash;for the lifetime of
the man who has received it as a special mark of favour from the
throne. In one respect at least it reflects greater glory on its
possessor than does hereditary nobility, as it is often the
deserved reward of merit. I am a noble by accident of birth; had I
not been born a noble I might never have become one. I am a lion
man because my father was; I may own lions because, beyond the
memory of man, an ancient ancestor of mine led the king's lions to
battle."</p>

<p>"What did Erot do to win his patent of nobility?" continued the
ape-man.</p>

<p>Gemnon grimaced. "Whatever services he has rendered have been
personal; he has never served the state with distinction. If he
owns any distinction, it is that of being the prince of flatterers,
the king of sycophants."</p>

<p>"Your queen seems too intelligent a woman to be duped by
flattery."</p>

<p>"No one is, always!"</p>

<p>"There are no flatterers among the beasts," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" demanded Gemnon. "Erot is almost a
beast."</p>

<p>"You malign the beasts. Did you ever see a lion that fawned upon
another creature to curry favour?"</p>

<p>Xerstle, entering from his room, interrupted their conversation.
"I have gathered my things together," he said; "I shall send a
slave for them presently." His manner was short and brusque. Gemnon
merely nodded in assent, and Xerstle departed.</p>

<p>"He does not seem pleased," commented the ape-man.</p>

<p>"May Xarator have him!" ejaculated Gemnon.</p>

<p>"Though he would serve a better purpose as food for my lions,"
he added as an afterthought, "if they would eat him."</p>

<p>"You own lions?" inquired Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Gemnon. "I am a lion man and must own
lions. It is a caste obligation. Each lion man must own lions of
war to fight in the service of the queen. I have five. In times of
peace I use them for hunting and racing. Only royalty and the lion
men may own lions." The sun was setting behind the mountains that
rimmed the western edge of the Field of the Lions as a slave
entered the apartment with a lighted cresset which he hung at the
end of a chain depending from the ceiling.</p>

<p>"It is time for the evening meal," announced Gemnon, rising.</p>

<p>"I have eaten," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Come anyway; it may interest you to meet the other nobles of
the palace."</p>

<p>Tarzan arose. "Very well," he said and followed Gemnon from the
apartment.</p>

<p>Forty nobles were assembled in a large dining room on the main
floor of the palace as Gemnon and Tarzan entered. Tomos was there
and Erot and Xerstle; several of the others Tarzan also recognized
as having been seen by him before, either in the council room or at
the stadium.</p>

<p>A sudden silence fell upon the assemblage as he entered, as
though the men had been interrupted while discussing either him or
Gemnon.</p>

<p>"This is Tarzan," announced Gemnon by way of introduction as he
led the ape-man to the table.</p>

<p>Tomos, who sat at the head of the table, did not appear pleased.
Erot was scowling; it was he who spoke first. "This table is for
nobles," he said, "not for slaves."</p>

<p>"By his own prowess and the grace of her majesty, the queen,
this man is here as my guest," said Gemnon quietly. "If one of my
equals takes exception to his presence, I will be glad to discuss
the matter with swords." He turned to Tarzan. "Because this man
sits at table with nobles of my own rank, I apologize for the
inference he intended you to draw from his words. I hope you are
not offended."</p>

<p>"Does the jackal offend the lion?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>The meal was not a complete success socially. Erot and Xerstle
whispered together. Tomos did not speak but applied himself
assiduously to the business of eating. Several of Gemnon's friends
engaged Tarzan in conversation, and he found one or two of them
agreeable, but others were inclined to be patronizing. Possibly
they would have been surprised and their attitude toward him
different had they known that their guest was a peer of England,
but then again this might have made little impression upon them
inasmuch as none of them had ever heard of England.</p>

<p>When Tomos arose and the others were free to go, Gemnon
conducted Tarzan to the apartments of the queen after returning to
his own apartments to don a more elaborate habergeon, helmet, and
equipments.</p>

<p>"Do not forget to kneel when we enter the presence of Nemone,"
cautioned Gemnon, "and do not speak until she addresses you." A
noble received them in a small anteroom where he left them while he
went to announce their presence to the queen, and as they waited
Gemnon's eyes watched the tall stranger standing quietly near
him.</p>

<p>"Have you no nerves?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"I have seen the bravest warriors tremble who had been summoned
before Nemone," explained his companion.</p>

<p>"I have never trembled," replied Tarzan. "How is it done?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Nemone will teach you to tremble."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but why should I tremble to go where a jackal does not
tremble to go?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand what you mean by that," said Gemnon,
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Erot is in there."</p>

<p>Gemnon grinned. "But how do you know that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I know," said Tarzan. He did not think it necessary to explain
that when the noble had opened the door his sensitive nostrils had
caught the scent spoor of the queen's favorite.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Gemnon, an expression of concern upon his
countenance. "If he is there, this may be a trap from which you
will never come out alive."</p>

<p>"One might fear the queen," replied Tarzan, "but not the
jackal."</p>

<p>"It is the queen of whom I was thinking."</p>

<p>The noble returned to the anteroom. He nodded to Tarzan. "Her
majesty will receive you now," he said.</p>

<p>"You may go, Gemnon; your attendance will not be required." Then
he turned to the ape-man once more.</p>

<p>"When I open the door and announce you, enter the room and
kneel. Remain kneeling until the queen tells you to arise, and do
not speak until after her majesty addresses you. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"I hear," replied Tarzan. "Open the door!"</p>

<p>Gemnon, just leaving the anteroom by another doorway, heard and
smiled, but the noble did not smile. He frowned.</p>

<p>The bronzed giant had spoken to him in a tone of command, but
the noble did not know what to do about it, so he opened the door.
But he got some revenge, or at least he thought that he did.</p>

<p>"The slave, Tarzan!" he announced in a loud voice.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Jungle stepped into the adjoining chamber,
crossed to the center of it, and stood erect, silently regarding
Nemone. He did not kneel. Erot was there standing at the foot of a
couch upon which the queen reclined upon fat pillows. The queen
regarded Tarzan from her deep eyes without any change of
expression, but Erot scowled angrily.</p>

<p>"Kneel, you fool!" he commanded.</p>

<p>"Silence!" admonished Nemone. "It is I who give commands."</p>

<p>Erot flushed and fingered the golden hilt of his sword. Tarzan
neither spoke nor moved nor took his eyes from the eyes of Nemone.
Though he had thought her beautiful before, he realized now that
she was even more gorgeous than he had believed it possible for any
woman to be.</p>

<p>"I shall not need you again tonight, Erot," said Nemone. "You
may go now."</p>

<p>Now Erot paled and then turned fiery red. He started to speak
but thought better of it; then he backed to the doorway, executed a
bow that brought him to one knee, arose and departed.</p>

<p>As Tarzan had crossed the threshold, his observing eyes noted
every detail of the room's interior almost in a single sweeping
glance. The chamber was not large, but magnificent in its
conception and its appointments. Columns of gold supported the
ceiling, the walls were tiled with ivory, the floor a mosaic of
colored stones upon which were scattered rugs of colored stuff and
the skins of animals.</p>

<p>On the walls were paintings, for the most part very crude, and
the usual array of heads, and at one end of the room a great lion
was chained between two of the golden Doric columns. He was a very
large lion with a tuft of white hair in his mane directly in the
center of the back of his neck.</p>

<p>From the instant that Tarzan entered the room the lion eyed him
malevolently, and Erot had scarcely passed out and closed the door
behind him when the beast sprang to his feet with a terrific roar
and leaped at the ape-man. The chains stopped him and he dropped
down, growling.</p>

<p>"Belthar does not like you," said Nemone who had remained
unmoved when the beast sprang. She noticed, too, that Tarzan had
not started nor given any other indication that he had heard the
lion or seen him, and she was pleased.</p>

<p>"He but reflects the attitude of all Cathne," replied
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That is not true," contradicted Nemone.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"I like you." Nemone's voice was low and caressing.</p>

<p>"You defied me before my people at the stadium today, but I did
not have you destroyed. Do you suppose that I should have permitted
you to live if I had not liked you? You do not kneel to me. No one
else in the world has ever refused to do that and lived. I have
never seen a man like you. I do not understand you; I am beginning
to think that I do not understand myself. You have piqued my
curiosity, Tarzan."</p>

<p>"And when that is satisfied you will kill me, perhaps?" asked
Tarzan, a half-smile curving his lip.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," admitted Nemone with a low laugh. "Come here and sit
down beside me. I want to talk with you; I want to know more about
you."</p>

<p>"I shall see that you do not learn too much," Tarzan assured her
as he crossed to the couch and seated himself facing her, while
Belthar growled and strained at his chains.</p>

<p>"In your own country you are no slave," said Nemone.</p>

<p>"But I do not need to ask that; your every act has proved it.
Perhaps you are a king?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "I am Tarzan," he said, as though that
explained everything, setting him above kings.</p>

<p>"Are you a lion man? You must be," insisted the queen.</p>

<p>"It would not make me better or worse, so what difference does
it make? You might make Erot a king, but he would still be
Erot."</p>

<p>A sudden frown darkened Nemone's countenance.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" she demanded. There was a suggestion
of anger in her tone.</p>

<p>"I mean that a title of nobility does not make a man noble. You
may call a jackal a lion, but he will still be a jackal."</p>

<p>"Do you not know that I am supposed to be very fond of Erot,"
she demanded, "or that you may drive my patience too far?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "You show execrable taste."</p>

<p>Nemone sat up very straight. Her eyes flashed. "I should have
you killed!" she cried. Tarzan said nothing. He just kept his eyes
on hers. She could not tell whether or not he was laughing at her.
Finally she sank back on her pillows with a gesture of resignation.
"What is the use?" she demanded. "You probably would not let me get
any satisfaction from killing you anyway, and by this time I should
be accustomed to being affronted. Now answer my question. Are you a
lion man in your own country?"</p>

<p>"I am a noble," replied the ape-man, "but I can tell you that
means little; a ditch digger may become a noble if he controls
enough votes, or a rich brewer if he subscribes a large amount of
money to the political party in power."</p>

<p>"And which were you," demanded Nemone, "a ditch digger or a rich
brewer?"</p>

<p>"Neither," laughed Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Then why are you a noble?" insisted the queen.</p>

<p>"For even less reason than either of those," admitted the
ape-man. "I am a noble through no merit of my own but by an
accident of birth; my family for many generations has been
noble."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Nemone. "It is just as I thought; you are a lion
man!"</p>

<p>"And what of it?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"It simplifies matters," she explained, but she did not amplify
the explanation nor did Tarzan either understand or inquire as to
its implication. As a matter of fact he was not greatly interested
in the subject.</p>

<p>Nemone extended a hand and laid it on his, a soft, warm hand
that trembled just a little. "I am going to give you your freedom,"
she said, "but on one condition."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"That you remain here, that you do not try to leave
Onthar&mdash;or me." Her voice was eager and just a little husky,
as though she spoke under suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>Tarzan remained silent. He would not promise, and so he did not
speak.</p>

<p>"I will make you a noble of Cathne," whispered Nemone. She was
sitting erect now, her face close to Tarzan's. "I will have made
for you helmets of gold and habergeons of ivory, the most
magnificent in Cathne. I will give you lions, fifty, a hundred! You
shall be the richest, the most powerful noble of my court!"</p>

<p>"I do not want such things," Tarzan said.</p>

<p>And then a door at the far end of the chamber opened and a
Negress entered. She had been very tall, but now she was old and
bent; her scraggly wool was scant and white. Her withered lips were
twisted into something that might have been either a snarl or a
grin, revealing her toothless gums. She stood in the doorway
leaning upon a staff and shaking her head, an ancient palsied
hag.</p>

<p>At the interruption Nemone straightened and looked around. The
expression that had softened her countenance was swept away by a
sudden wave of rage, inarticulate but no less terrible.</p>

<p>The old hag tapped upon the floor with her staff; her head
nodded ceaselessly like that of some grotesque and horrible doll,
and her lips were still contorted in what Tarzan realized now was
no smile but a hideous snarl.</p>

<p>"Come!" she cackled. "Come! Come! Come!"</p>

<p>Nemone sprang to her feet and faced the woman.</p>

<p>"M'duze!" she screamed. "I could kill you! I could tear you to
pieces! Get out of here!"</p>

<p>But the old woman only tapped with her staff and cackled, "Come!
Come! Come!"</p>

<p>Slowly Nemone approached her. As one drawn by an invisible and
irresistible power, the queen crossed the chamber, the old hag
stepped aside, and the queen passed on through the doorway into the
darkness of a corridor beyond. The old woman turned her eyes upon
Tarzan, and, snarling, backed through the door after Nemone.
Noiselessly the door closed behind them.</p>

<p>Tarzan had arisen as Nemone arose. For an instant he hesitated
and then took a step toward the doorway in pursuit of the queen and
the old hag. Then he heard a door open and a step behind him, and
turned to see the noble who had ushered him into Nemone's presence
standing just within the threshold.</p>

<p>"You may return to the quarters of Gemnon," announced the noble
politely.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook himself as might a lion; he drew a palm across his
eyes as one whose vision has been clouded by a mist. Then he drew a
deep sigh and moved towards the doorway as the noble stepped aside
to let him pass, but whether it was a sigh of relief or regret, who
may say?</p>

<p>As the Lord of the Jungle passed out of the chamber, Belthar
sprang to the ends of his chains with a thunderous roar.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; THE LIONS OF
CATHNE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Gemnon entered the living room of their
quarters the morning after Tarzan's audience with Nemone, he found
the ape-man standing by the window looking out over the palace
grounds.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you here this morning," said the Cathnean.</p>

<p>"And surprised, perhaps," suggested the Lord of the Jungle.</p>

<p>"I should not have been surprised had you never returned,"
replied Gemnon. "How did she receive you? And Erot? I suppose he
was glad to have you there!"</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled. "He did not appear to be, but it did not matter
much as the queen sent him away immediately."</p>

<p>"And you were alone with her all evening?" Gemnon appeared
incredulous.</p>

<p>"Belthar and I," Tarzan corrected him. "Belthar does not seem to
like me any better than Erot does."</p>

<p>"Yes, Belthar would be there," commented Gemnon. "She usually
has him chained near her. But do not be offended if he does not
like you; Belthar likes no one. Belthar is a man-eater. How did
Nemone treat you?"</p>

<p>"She was gracious," Tarzan assured him, "and that, too,
notwithstanding the first thing I did was to offend her royal
majesty."</p>

<p>"And what was that?" demanded Gemnon.</p>

<p>"I remained standing when I should have knelt," explained
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But I told you to kneel!" exclaimed Gemnon.</p>

<p>"So did the noble at the door."</p>

<p>"And you forgot?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You refused to kneel? And she did not have you destroyed! It is
incredible."</p>

<p>"But it is true, and she offered to make me a noble and give me
a hundred lions."</p>

<p>Gemnon shook his head. "What enchantment have you worked to so
change Nemone?"</p>

<p>"None; it was I who was under a spell. I have told you these
things because I do not understand them. You are the only friend I
have in Cathne, and I come to you for an explanation of much that
was mysterious in my visit to the queen last night. I doubt that I
or another can ever understand the woman herself. She can be tender
or terrible, weak or strong within the span of a dozen seconds. One
moment she is the autocrat, the next the obedient vassal of a
slave."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Gemnon. "So you saw M'duze! I'll warrant she was
none too cordial."</p>

<p>"No," admitted the ape-man. "As a matter of fact, she did not
pay any attention to me; she just ordered Nemone out of the room,
and Nemone went. The remarkable feature of the occurrence lies in
the fact that, though the queen did not want to leave and was very
angry about it, she obeyed the old woman meekly."</p>

<p>"There are many legends surrounding M'duze," said Gemnon, "but
there is one that is whispered more often than the others, though
you may rest assured that it is only whispered and, at that, only
among trusted friends.</p>

<p>"M'duze has been a slave in the royal family since the days of
Nemone's grandfather. She was only a child then, a few years older
than the king's son, Nemone's father. The oldsters recall that she
was a fine-looking young woman, and the legend that is only
whispered is that Nemone is her daughter.</p>

<p>"About a year after Nemone was born, in the tenth year of her
father's reign, the queen died under peculiar and suspicious
circumstances. Her child, a son, was born just before the queen
expired. He was named Alextar, and he still lives."</p>

<p>"Then why is he not king?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That is a long story of mystery and court intrigue and murder,
perhaps, of which more is surmised than is actually known by more
than two now living. Perhaps Nemone knows, but that is doubtful,
though she must guess close to the truth.</p>

<p>"Immediately following the death of the queen the influence of
M'duze increased and became more apparent. M'duze favored Tomos, a
noble of little or no importance at the time, and from that day the
influence and power of Tomos grew. Then, about a year after the
death of the queen, the king died. It was so obvious that he had
been poisoned that a revolt of the nobles was barely averted; but
Tomos, guided by M'duze, conciliated them by fixing the guilt upon
a slave woman of whom M'duze was jealous and executing her.</p>

<p>"For ten years Tomos ruled as regent for the boy, Alextar.
During this time he had, quite naturally, established his own
following in important positions in the palace and in the council.
Alextar was adjudged insane and imprisoned in the temple; Nemone,
at the age of twelve, was crowned queen of Cathne.</p>

<p>"Erot is a creature of M'duze and Tomos, a situation that has
produced a mix-up that would be amusing were it not so tragic.
Tomos wishes to marry Nemone, but M'duze will not permit it. M'duze
wishes Nemone to marry Erot, but Erot is not a lion man, and, so
far, the Queen has refused to break this ancient custom that
requires the ruler to marry into this highest class of Cathneans.
M'duze is insistent upon the marriage because she can control Erot,
and she discourages any interest which Nemone may manifest in other
men, which undoubtedly accounts for her having interrupted the
queen's visit with you.</p>

<p>"You may rest assured that M'duze is your enemy, and it may be
of value to you to recall that whoever has stood in the old hag's
path has died a violent death. Beware of M'duze and Tomos and Erot,
and, as a friend, I may say to you in confidence, beware of Nemone,
also. And now let us forget the cruel and sordid side of Cathne and
go for that walk I promised you for this morning, that you may see
the beauty of the city and the riches of her citizens."</p>

<p><br>
Along avenues bordered by old trees Gemnon led Tarzan between the
low, white and gold homes of nobles, glimpses of which were
discernible only occasionally through grilled gateways in the walls
that enclosed their spacious grounds. For a mile they walked along
the stone-flagged street. Passing nobles greeted Gemnon, some
nodding to his companion. Artisans, tradesmen, and slaves stopped
to stare at the strange, bronzed giant who had overthrown the
strongest man in Cathne.</p>

<p>Then they came to a high wall that separated this section of the
city from the next. Massive gates, swung wide now and guarded by
warriors, opened into a portion of the city inhabited by better
class artisans and tradesmen. Their grounds were less spacious,
their houses smaller and plainer, but evidences of prosperity and
even affluence were apparent everywhere.</p>

<p>Beyond this was a meaner district, yet even here all was orderly
and neat, nor was there any sign of abject poverty in either the
people or their homes. Here, as in the other portions of the city,
they occasionally met a tame lion either wandering about or lying
before the gate of its master's grounds.</p>

<p>As the two men talked they continued on toward the center of the
city until they came to a large square that was bounded on all
sides by shops. Here were many people. All classes from nobles to
slaves mingled before the shops and in the great open square of the
market place.</p>

<p>There were lions held by slaves who were exhibiting them for
sale for their noble masters who dickered with prospective
purchasers, other nobles. Near the lion market was the slave block,
and as slaves, unlike lions, might be owned by anyone, there was
brisk bidding on the part of many wishing to buy. A huge black
Galla was on the block as Tarzan and Gemnon paused to watch the
scene.</p>

<p>"For all the interest he shows," remarked Tarzan, "one might
think that being sold like a piece of merchandise or a bullock was
a daily occurrence in his life."</p>

<p>"Not quite daily," replied Gemnon, "but no novelty. He has been
sold many times. I know him well; I used to own him."</p>

<p>"Look at him!" shouted the seller. "Look at those arms! Look at
those legs! Look at that back! He is as strong as an elephant, and
not a blemish on him. Sound as a lion's tooth he is; never ill a
day in his life. And docile! A child can handle him."</p>

<p>"He is so refractory that no one can handle him," commented
Gemnon in a whisper to the ape-man. "That is the reason I had to
get rid of him; that is the reason he is up for sale so often."</p>

<p>"There seem to be plenty of customers interested in him,"
observed Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Do you see that slave in the red tunic?" asked Gemnon. "He
belongs to Xerstle, and he is bidding on that fellow. He knows all
about him, too. He knew him when the man belonged to me."</p>

<p>"Then why does he want to buy him?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"I do not know, but there are other uses to which a slave may be
put than labor. Xerstle may not care what sort of a disposition the
fellow has or even whether he will work."</p>

<p>It was Xerstle's slave who bought the Galla as Tarzan and Gemnon
moved on to look at the goods displayed in the shops. There were
many articles of leather, wood, ivory, or gold; there were
dagger-swords, spears, shields, habergeons, helmets, and sandals.
One shop displayed nothing but articles of apparel for women;
another, perfumes and incense. There were jewelery shops, vegetable
shops, and meat shops. The last displayed dried meats and fish and
the carcasses of goats and sheep. The fronts of these shops were
heavily barred to prevent passing lions from raiding them, Gemnon
explained.</p>

<p>Wherever Tarzan went he attracted attention, and a small crowd
always followed him, for he had been recognized the moment that he
had entered the market place.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here," suggested the Lord of the Jungle. "I do
not like crowds."</p>

<p>"Suppose we go back to the palace and look at the queen's
lions," said Gemnon.</p>

<p>"I would rather look at lions than people," Tarzan assured
him.</p>

<p>The war lions of Cathne were kept in stables within the royal
grounds at a considerable distance from the palace. The building
was of stone neatly laid and painted white. In it each lion had his
separate cage, and outside were yards surrounded by high stone
walls near the tops of which pointed sticks, set close together and
inclined downward on the inside of the walls, kept the lions from
escaping. In these yards the lions exercised themselves.</p>

<p>There was another, larger arena where they were trained by a
corps of keepers under the supervision of nobles; here the racing
lions were taught to obey the commands of the hunter, to trail, to
charge, to retrieve.</p>

<p>As Tarzan entered the stable a familiar scent spoor impinged
upon his nostrils. "Belthar is here," he remarked to Gemnon.</p>

<p>"It is possible," replied the noble, "but I don't understand how
you know it."</p>

<p>As they were walking along in front of the cages inspecting the
lions that were inside, Gemnon, who was in advance, suddenly
halted. "How do you do it?" he demanded. "Last night you knew that
Erot was with Nemone, though you could not see him and no one could
have informed you, and now you knew that Belthar was here, and sure
enough, he is."</p>

<p>Tarzan approached and stood beside Gemnon, and the instant that
Belthar's eyes fell upon him the beast leaped against the bars of
his cage in an effort to seize the ape-man, at the same time
voicing an angry roar that shook the building.</p>

<p>Instantly keepers came running to the spot, certain that
something had gone amiss, but Gemnon assured them that it was only
Belthar exhibiting his bad temper.</p>

<p>"He does not like me," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"If he ever got you, he would make short work of you," said a
head keeper.</p>

<p>"It is evident that he would like to," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"He is a bad one and a man-killer," said Gemnon after the
keepers had departed, "but Nemone will not have him destroyed.
Occasionally he is loosed in the palace arena with someone who has
incurred Nemone's disfavor; thus she derives pleasure from the
sufferings of the culprit.</p>

<p>"Formerly he was her best hunting lion, but the last time he was
used he killed four men and nearly escaped. He has already eaten
three keepers who ventured into the arena with him, and he will eat
more before good fortune rids us of him. Nemone is supposed to
entertain a superstition that in some peculiar way her life and the
life of Belthar are linked in some mysterious, supernatural bond
and that when one dies the other must die. Naturally, under the
circumstances, it is neither politic or safe to suggest that she
destroy the old devil. It is odd that he has conceived such a
violent dislike for you."</p>

<p>"I have met lions before which did not like me," said
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"May you never meet Belthar in the open, my friend!"</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; THE MAN IN THE LION
PIT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Tarzan and Gemnon turned away from Belthar's
cage a slave approached the ape-man and addressed him.</p>

<p>"Nemone, the queen, commands your presence immediately," he
said. "You are to come to the ivory room; the noble Gemnon will
wait in the anteroom. These are the commands of Nemone, the
queen."</p>

<p>"What now, I wonder!" exclaimed Tarzan as they walked through
the royal grounds toward the palace.</p>

<p>"No one ever knows why he is summoned to an audience with Nemone
until he gets there," commented Gemnon. "One may be going to
receive an honor or hear his death sentence. Nemone is capricious.
She is always bored and always seeking relief from her boredom.
Oftentimes she finds strange avenues of escape that make one wonder
if her mind&mdash;but no! Such thoughts may not even be whispered
among friends."</p>

<p>When Tarzan presented himself he was immediately admitted to the
ivory room, where he found Nemone and Erot much as he had found
them the preceding night. Nemone greeted him with a smile that was
almost pathetically eager, but Erot only scowled darkly, making no
effort to conceal his growing hatred.</p>

<p>"We are having a diversion this morning," Nemone explained, "and
we summoned you and Gemnon to enjoy it with us. A party raiding in
Thenar a day or two ago captured an Athnean noble. We are going to
have some sport with him this morning."</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded. He did not understand what she meant, and he was
not particularly interested.</p>

<p>Nemone turned to Erot. "Go and tell them we are ready," she
directed, "and ascertain if all is in readiness for us."</p>

<p>Erot flushed and backed toward the door, still scowling.</p>

<p>"It shall be as the queen commands," replied Erot in a surly
tone.</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind him, Nemone motioned Tarzan to a
seat upon the couch. "I am afraid that Erot does not like you," she
said, smiling. "He is furious that you do not kneel to me, and that
I do not compel you to do so. I really do not know, myself, why I
do not."</p>

<p>"There might be two reasons, either of which would be
sufficient," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"And what are they? I have been curious to know how you
explained it."</p>

<p>"Consideration of the customs of a stranger and courtesy to a
guest," suggested Tarzan.</p>

<p>Nemone considered for a moment. "Yes," she admitted, "either is
a fairly good reason, but neither is really in keeping with the
customs of the court of Nemone. And then they are practically the
same thing, so they constitute only one reason. Is there not
another?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tarzan. "There is an even better one, the one
which probably influences you to overlook my dereliction."</p>

<p>"And what is it?"</p>

<p>"The fact that you cannot make me kneel."</p>

<p>A hard look flashed in the queen's eyes; it was not the answer
she had been hoping for. Tarzan's eyes did not leave hers; she saw
amusement in them. "Oh, why do I endure it!" she cried, and with
the query her anger melted. "You should not try to make it so hard
for me to be nice to you," she said almost appealingly.</p>

<p>"I wish to be nice to you, Nemone," he replied, "but not at the
price of my self-respect. But that is not the only reason why I
shall never kneel to you."</p>

<p>"What is the other reason?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"That I wish you to like me. You would not like me if I cringed
to you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," she admitted musingly.</p>

<p>"Everyone cringes, until the sight of it disgusts me, yet I am
angry when they do not cringe. Why is that?"</p>

<p>"You will be offended if I tell you," warned the ape-man.</p>

<p>"In the past two days I have become accustomed to being
offended," she replied with a grimace of resignation, "so you might
as well tell me."</p>

<p>"You are angry if they do not cringe, because you are not quite
sure of yourself. You wish this outward evidence of their
subservience that you may be constantly reassured that you are
queen of Cathne."</p>

<p>"Who says that I am not queen of Cathne?" she demanded,
instantly on the defensive. "Who says that will find that I am and
that I have the power of life and death."</p>

<p>"You do not impress me," said Tarzan. "I have not said that you
are not queen of Cathne, only that your manner may often suggest
your own doubts. A queen should be so sure of herself that she can
always afford to be gracious and merciful."</p>

<p>For a while Nemone sat in silence, evidently pondering the
thought that Tarzan had suggested. "They would not understand," she
said at last. "If I were gracious and merciful they would think me
weak; then they would take advantage of me, and eventually they
would destroy me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tarzan, I wish that you would promise to remain in Cathne.
If you will, there is nothing that you may not have from Nemone. I
would build you a palace second only to my own. I would be very
good to you. We&mdash;you could be very happy here."</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head. "Tarzan can be happy in the jungle
only."</p>

<p>Nemone leaned close to him; she seized him fiercely by the
shoulders. "I will make you happy here," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Erot and M'duze and Tomos may think differently," Tarzan
reminded her.</p>

<p>"I hate them!" cried Nemone. "If they interfere this time, I
shall kill them all!"</p>

<p>The door opened and Erot entered unceremoniously; he knelt, but
the act was nearer a gesture than an accomplished fact. Nemone
flashed an angry look at him.</p>

<p>"Before you enter our presence," she said coldly, "see to it
that you are properly announced and that we have expressed a desire
to receive you."</p>

<p>"But your majesty," objected Erot, "have I not been in the habit
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have gotten into bad habits," she interrupted; "see that
you mend them. Is the diversion arranged?"</p>

<p>"All is in readiness, your majesty," replied the crestfallen
Erot.</p>

<p>"Come, then!" directed Nemone, motioning Tarzan to follow
her.</p>

<p>In the anteroom they found Gemnon waiting, and the Queen bid him
accompany them. Preceded and followed by armed guards, they passed
along several corridors and through a number of rooms, then up a
stairway to the second floor of the palace. Here they were
conducted to a balcony overlooking a small enclosed court. The
windows opening onto this court from the first storey of the
building were heavily barred, and from just below the top of the
parapet, behind which the queen and her party sat, sharpened stakes
protruded, giving the court the appearance of a miniature arena for
wild animals.</p>

<p>As Tarzan looked down into the courtyard, wondering a little
what the nature of the diversion was to be, a door at one end swung
open and a young lion stepped out into the sunlight, blinking his
eyes and looking about. When he saw those on the balcony looking
down at him, he growled.</p>

<p>"He is going to make a good lion," remarked Nemone. "From a cub,
he has been vicious."</p>

<p>"What is he doing in here," asked Tarzan, "or what is he going
to do?"</p>

<p>"He is going to entertain us," replied Nemone. "Presently an
enemy of Cathne will be turned into the pit with him, the Athnean
who was captured in Thenar."</p>

<p>"And if he kills the lion you will give him his liberty?"
demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>Nemone laughed. "I promise that I will, but he will not kill the
lion."</p>

<p>"He might," said Tarzan; "men have killed lions before."</p>

<p>"With their bare hands?" asked Nemone.</p>

<p>"You mean the man will not be armed?" demanded Tarzan
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why, of course not!" exclaimed Nemone. "He is not being put in
there to kill or wound a fine young lion but to be killed."</p>

<p>"And he has no chance, then! That is not sport; it is
murder!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to go down and defend him," sneered
Erot. "The queen would give the fellow his liberty if he had a
champion who would kill the lion, for that is the custom."</p>

<p>"It is a custom that is without a precedent since I have been
queen," said Nemone. "It is true that it is a law of the arena, but
I have yet to see a champion volunteer to take the risk."</p>

<p>The lion paced across the courtyard and stood directly beneath
the balcony, glaring up at them. He was a splendid beast, young but
full-grown.</p>

<p>"He is going to be a mean customer," remarked Gemnon.</p>

<p>"He already is," rejoined the queen. "I was going to make a
racing lion of him, but after he killed a couple of trainers I
decided that he would make a better hunting lion for grand hunts.
There is the Athnean." She pointed down into the courtyard. "He is
a fine-looking young fellow."</p>

<p>Tarzan glanced at the stalwart figure in ivory standing upon the
opposite side of the small arena bravely awaiting his fate; then
the lion turned its head slowly in the direction of the prey it had
not yet seen. At the same instant Tarzan seized the hilt of Erot's
dagger-like sword, tore the weapon from its sheath, and, stepping
to the top of the parapet, leaped for the lion below.</p>

<p>So quickly and so silently had he moved that none was aware of
his intent until it had been accomplished. Gemnon voiced an
ejaculation of astonishment; Erot, of relief; while Nemone cried
out in genuine terror and alarm. Leaning over the parapet, the
queen saw the lion struggling to tear the body that had crushed it
to the stone flagging, or escape from beneath it. The horrid growls
of the beast reverberated in the narrow confines of the pit, and
mingled with them were the growls of the beast-man on its back. One
bronzed arm was about the maned neck of the carnivore, two powerful
legs were locked around its middle, and the sharp point of Erot's
sword was awaiting the opportune instant to plunge into the savage
heart. The Athnean was running towards the two embattled
beasts.</p>

<p>"By Thoos!" exclaimed Nemone. "If the lion kills him, I will
have it torn limb from limb. It must not kill him! Go down there,
Erot, and help him. Go, Gemnon."</p>

<p>Gemnon did not wait, but springing to the parapet, lowered
himself by the stakes and dropped into the courtyard. Erot hung
back. "Let him take care of himself," he grumbled.</p>

<p>Nemone turned to the guard standing behind her. She was white
with apprehension because of Tarzan and with rage and disgust at
Erot. "Throw him into the pit," she commanded, pointing at the
cringing favorite. But Erot did not wait to be thrown, and a moment
later he had followed Gemnon to the courtyard.</p>

<p>Neither Erot nor Gemnon nor the man from Athne was needed to
save Tarzan from the lion, for already he had sunk the sword into
the tawny side. Twice again the point drove into the wild heart
before the roaring beast collapsed upon the white stones, and its
great voice was stilled forever.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan rose to his feet. For a moment the men about him,
the queen leaning across the parapet above, the city of gold, all
were forgotten. Here was no English lord, but a beast of the jungle
that had made its kill. With one foot upon the carcass of the lion,
the ape-man raised his face towards the heavens, and from the heart
of the palace of Nemone rose the hideous victory cry of the bull
ape that has killed.</p>

<p>Gemnon and Erot shuddered, and Nemone drew back in terror. But
the Athnean was unmoved; he had heard that savage challenge before.
He was Valthor. And now Tarzan turned; all the savagery faded from
his countenance as he stretched forth a hand and laid it on
Valthor's shoulder. "We meet again, my friend," he said.</p>

<p>"And once again you save my life!" exclaimed the Athnean
noble.</p>

<p>The two men had spoken in low tones that had not carried to the
ears of Nemone or the others in the balcony; Erot, fearful that the
lion might not be dead, had run to the far end of the court, where
he was cowering behind a column; that Gemnon might have heard did
not concern Tarzan, who trusted the young Cathnean. But those
others must not know that he had known Valthor before, or
immediately the old story that Tarzan had come from Athne to
assassinate Nemone would be revived, and then a miracle could not
save either of them.</p>

<p>His hand still upon Valthor's shoulder, Tarzan spoke again
rapidly in a whisper. "They must not know that we are acquainted,"
he said. "They are looking for an excuse to kill me, some of them,
but as far as you are concerned they do not have to look for
any."</p>

<p>Nemone was now calling orders rapidly to those about her. "Go
down and let Tarzan out of the arena; Tarzan and Gemnon, send them
to me. Erot may go to his quarters until I give further orders; I
do not wish to see him again. Take the Athnean back to his cell;
later I will decide how he shall be destroyed."</p>

<p>Tarzan heard the queen's commands with surprise and resentment,
and, wheeling, he looked up at her. "This man is free by your own
word," he reminded her. "If he be returned to a cell, I shall go
with him, for I have told him that he would be free."</p>

<p>"Do with him as you please," cried Nemone; "he is yours. Only
come up to me, Tarzan. I thought that you would be killed, and I am
still frightened." Erot and Gemnon heard these words with vastly
different emotions. Each recognized that they signalized a change
in the affairs of the court of Cathne. Gemnon anticipated the
effects of a better influence injected into the councils of Nemone,
and was pleased. Erot saw the flimsy structure of his temporary
grandeur and reflected authority crumbling to ruin. Both were
astonished by this sudden revealment of a new Nemone, whom none had
ever before seen bow to the authority of other than M'duze.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Gemnon and Valthor, Tarzan returned to the
balcony where Nemone, her composure regained, awaited them. For a
moment, moved by excitement and apprehension for Tarzan's safety,
she had revealed a feminine side of her character that few of her
intimates might even have suspected she possessed, but now she was
the queen again. She surveyed Valthor haughtily and yet with
interest.</p>

<p>"What is your name, Athnean?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Valthor," he replied and added, "of the house of Xanthus."</p>

<p>"We know the house," remarked Nemone. "Its head is a king's
councilor; a most noble house and close to the royal line in both
blood and authority."</p>

<p>"My father is the head of the house of Xanthus," said
Valthor.</p>

<p>"You would have made a noble hostage," sighed Nemone, "but we
have given our promise that you shall be freed."</p>

<p>"I would have been honored by such a position," replied Valthor,
the faintest trace of a smile upon his lips, "but I shall have to
be content to wait a more propitious event."</p>

<p>"We shall look forward with keen anticipation to that moment,"
rejoined Nemone graciously. "In the meantime we will arrange an
escort to return you to Athne, and hope for better fortune the next
time that you fall into our hands. Be ready then early tomorrow to
return to your own country."</p>

<p>"I thank your majesty," replied Valthor. "I shall be ready, and
when I go I shall carry with me, to cherish through life, the
memory of the gracious and beautiful queen of Cathne."</p>

<p>"Our noble Gemnon shall be your host until tomorrow," announced
Nemone. "Take him with you now to your quarters, Gemnon, and let it
be known that he is Nemone's guest whom none may harm."</p>

<p>Tarzan would have accompanied Gemnon and Valthor, but Nemone
detained him. "You will return to my apartments with me," she
directed. "I wish to talk with you."</p>

<p>As they walked through the palace, the queen did not precede her
companion as the etiquette of the court demanded but moved close at
his side, looking up into his face as she talked. "I was
frightened, Tarzan," she confided. "It is not often that Nemone is
frightened by the peril of another, but when I saw you leap into
the arena with the lion, my heart stood still. Why did you do it,
Tarzan?"</p>

<p>"I was disgusted with what I saw," replied the ape-man
shortly.</p>

<p>"Disgusted! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The cowardliness of the authority that would permit an unarmed
and utterly defenseless man to be forced into an arena with a
lion," explained Tarzan candidly.</p>

<p>Nemone flushed. "You know that that authority is I," she said
coldly.</p>

<p>"Of course I know it," replied the ape-man, "but that only
renders it the more odious."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she snapped. "Are you trying to drive me
beyond my patience? If you knew me better you would know that that
is not safe, not even for you, before whom I have already humbled
myself."</p>

<p>"I am not seeking to try your patience," replied the ape-man
quietly, "for I am neither interested nor concerned in your powers
of self-control. I am merely shocked that one so beautiful may at
the same time be so heartless."</p>

<p>The flush faded from the queen's face, the anger from her eyes.
She moved on in silence, her mood suddenly introspective, and when
they reached the anteroom leading to her private chambers she
halted at the threshold of the latter and laid a hand gently upon
the arm of the man at her side.</p>

<p>"You are very brave," she said. "Only a very brave man would
have leaped into the arena with the lion to save a stranger, but
only the bravest of the brave could have dared to speak to Nemone
as you have spoken, for the death that the lion deals may be
merciful compared with that which Nemone deals when she has been
affronted.</p>

<p>"Yet perhaps you knew that I would forgive you. Oh, Tarzan, what
magic have you exercised to win such power over me!" She took him
by the hand then and led him toward the doorway of her chambers.
"You shall teach Nemone how to be human!" As the door swung open
there was a new light in the eyes of the queen of Cathne, a softer
light than had ever before shone in those beautiful depths. Then it
faded, to be replaced by a cold, hard glitter of bitterness and
hate. Facing them, in the center of the apartment, stood
M'duze.</p>

<p>She stood there, bent and horrible, wagging her head and tapping
the stone floor with her staff. She spoke no word, but fixed them
with her baleful glare. As one held in the grip of a power she was
unable to resist, Nemone moved slowly towards the ancient hag,
leaving Tarzan just beyond the threshold. Slowly and silently the
door closed between them. Beyond it the ape-man heard, faintly, the
tapping of the staff upon the colored stones of the mosaic.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; ASSASSIN IN THE
NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A GREAT lion moved silently from the south across
the border of Kaffa. If he were following a trail, the heavy rain
that had terminated the wet season must have obliterated it long
since; yet he moved on with a certain assurance that betokened no
sign of doubt.</p>

<p>Why was he there? What urge had drawn him thus, contrary to the
habits and customs of his kind, upon this long and arduous journey?
Where was he bound? What or whom did he seek? Only he, Numa the
lion, king of beasts, knew.</p>

<p><br>
In his quarters in the palace, Erot paced the floor, angry and
disconsolate. Sprawled on a bench, his feet wide apart, sat Xerstle
deep in thought. The two men were facing a crisis, and they were
terrified. Had Erot definitely fallen from the favor of the queen,
Xerstle would be dragged down with him; of that there was no
doubt.</p>

<p>"But there must be something you can do," insisted Xerstle.</p>

<p>"I have seen both Tomos and M'duze," replied Erot drearily, "and
they have promised to help. But Nemone is infatuated with this
stranger. None knows Nemone better than does M'duze, and I can tell
you, Xerstle, the old hag is frightened. Nemone hates her, and if
the attempted thwarting of this new passion arouses her anger
sufficiently, it may sweep away the fear that the queen has always
held for M'duze, and she will destroy her. It is this that M'duze
fears. And you can imagine how terrified old Tomos is! Without
M'duze he would be lost, for Nemone tolerates him only because
M'duze demands it."</p>

<p>"But there must be some way," again insisted Xerstle.</p>

<p>"There is no way so long as this fellow, Tarzan, is able to turn
Nemone's heart to water," answered Erot. "Why, he does not even
kneel to her, and he speaks to her as one might to a naughty slave
girl."</p>

<p>"But there is a way!" exclaimed Xerstle in a sudden whisper.
"Listen!" Then he launched forth into a detailed explanation of his
plan. Erot sat listening to his friend, an expression of rapt
interest upon his face. A slave girl crossed the living room where
the two men talked, and departed into the corridor beyond, but so
engrossed were Erot and Xerstle that neither was aware that she had
come or that she had gone.</p>

<p><br>
In their quarters that evening Gemnon and Tarzan partook of the
final meal of the day, for neither had enjoyed the prospect of
again eating with the other nobles. Valthor slept in the bedroom,
having asked not to be disturbed until morning.</p>

<p>"When you have definitely displaced Erot, conditions will be
different," explained Gemnon. "Then they will fawn upon you, shower
you with attentions, and wait upon your every whim."</p>

<p>"That will never occur," snapped the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded his companion. "There is nothing that Nemone
would not do for you, absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>"Why, man, you can rule Cathne if you so choose."</p>

<p>"But I do not choose," replied Tarzan. "Nemone may be mad but I
am not. And even were I, I could never be mad enough to accept a
position that had once been filled by Erot; the idea disgusts me;
let us talk of something pleasant."</p>

<p>"Very well," consented Gemnon with a smile. "Perhaps I think you
are foolish, but I admit that I cannot help but admire your courage
and decency.</p>

<p>"And now for something more pleasant! Something very much more
pleasant! I am going to take you visiting tonight. I am going to
take you to see the most beautiful girl in Cathne."</p>

<p>"I thought that there could be no woman in Cathne more beautiful
than the queen," objected Tarzan.</p>

<p>"There would not be if Nemone knew of her," replied Gemnon, "but
fortunately she does not know. She has never seen this girl, and
may Thoos forbid that she ever does!"</p>

<p>"You are much interested," remarked the ape-man, smiling.</p>

<p>"I am in love with her," explained Gemnon simply.</p>

<p>"And Nemone has never seen her? I should think that a difficult
condition to maintain, for Cathne is not large, and if the girl be
of the same class as you, many other nobles must know of her
beauty. One would expect such news to come quickly to the ears of
Nemone."</p>

<p>"She is surrounded by very loyal friends, this girl of whom I
speak," replied Gemnon. "She is Doria, the daughter of Thudos. Her
father is a very powerful noble and head of the faction which
wishes to place Alextar on the throne. Only Nemone's knowledge of
his great power preserves his life, but owing to the strained
relations that exist between Nemone and his house neither he nor
members of his family are often at court. Thus it has been easier
to prevent knowledge of the great beauty of Doria coming to
Nemone."</p>

<p>As the two men were leaving the palace a short time later, they
came unexpectedly upon Xerstle, who was most effusive in his
greetings. "Congratulations, Tarzan!" he exclaimed, halting the
companions. "That was a most noble feat you performed in the lion
pit today. All the palace is talking about it, and let me be among
the first to tell you how glad I am that you have won the
confidence of our gracious and beautiful queen by your bravery,
strength, and magnanimity."</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded in acknowledgment of the man's avowal and started
to move on, but Xerstle held him with a gesture. "We must see more
of one another," he continued. "I am arranging a grand hunt, and I
must have you as my guest of honor. There will be but a few of us,
a most select party, and I can assure you of good sport. When all
the arrangements are completed, I will let you know the day of the
hunt. And now good-bye and good luck to you!"</p>

<p>"I care nothing about him or his grand hunt," said Tarzan as he
and Gemnon continued on toward the home of Doria.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be well to accept," advised Gemnon.</p>

<p>"That fellow and his friends will bear watching, and if you are
with them occasionally you can watch them that much better."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "If I am still here, I shall go with him if you
think best."</p>

<p>"If you are still here!" exclaimed Gemnon. "You certainly are
not expecting to get away from Cathne, are you?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," replied Tarzan. "I may go any day or night.
There is nothing to hold me here, and I have given no promise that
I would not escape when I wished."</p>

<p>Gemnon smiled a wry smile that Tarzan did not see in the
semi-darkness of the ill-lit avenue through which they were
passing. "That will make it extremely interesting for me," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Nemone turned you over into my keeping. If you escape while I
am responsible for you, she will have me destroyed."</p>

<p>A frown knit the brows of the Lord of the Jungle.</p>

<p>"I did not know that," he said, "but you need not worry. I shall
not go until you have been relieved of responsibility." A sudden
smile lighted his countenance. "I think I shall ask Nemone to
give me over into the keeping of Erot or Xerstle."</p>

<p>Gemnon chuckled. "What a story that would make!" he cried.</p>

<p>An occasional torch only partially dispelled the gloom beneath
the overhanging trees that bordered the avenue that led toward the
palace of Thudos. At the intersection of a narrow alleyway, beneath
the branches of a wide spreading oak a dark figure lurked in the
shadows as Tarzan and Gemnon approached. The keen eyes of the
ape-man saw and recognized it as the figure of a man before they
came close enough to be in danger, and Tarzan was ready even though
he had no suspicion that the man's presence there was in any way
concerned with him, for it is the business of the jungle-bred to be
always ready, whether danger threatens or not.</p>

<p>Just as the two came opposite the figure, Tarzan heard his name
whispered in a hoarse voice. He stopped. "Beware of Erot!"
whispered the voice. "Tonight!" Then the figure wheeled and
lumbered into the denser shadows of the narrow alleyway, but in the
glimpse that Tarzan got of it there was a familiar roll to the
great body, just as there had been a suggestion of familiarity in
the voice.</p>

<p>"Now who do you suppose that is?" demanded Gemnon. "Come on!
We'll capture him and find out," and he started as though to pursue
the stranger down the alley.</p>

<p>Tarzan laid a restraining hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "It was someone who has tried to befriend me. If
he wishes to conceal his identity, it is not for me to reveal
it."</p>

<p>"You are right," assented Gemnon.</p>

<p>"And I think I would have learned no more by pursuing him than I
already know. I recognized him by his voice and his gait, and then,
as he turned to leave, a movement in the air brought his scent
spoor to my nostrils.</p>

<p>"I think I would recognize that a mile away, for it is very
strong; it always is in powerful men and beasts."</p>

<p>"Why was he afraid of you?" asked Gemnon.</p>

<p>"He was not afraid of me; he was afraid of you because you are a
noble."</p>

<p>"He need not have been, if he is a friend of yours. I would not
have betrayed him."</p>

<p>"I know that, but he could not. You are a noble, and so you
might be a friend of Erot. I do not mind telling you who it was,
because I know you would not use the knowledge to harm him. But you
will be surprised; I surely was. It was Phobeg."</p>

<p>"No! Why should he befriend the man who defeated and humiliated
him, and almost killed him?"</p>

<p>"Because he did not kill him. Phobeg is a simple minded fellow,
but he is the type that would not be devoid of gratitude. He is the
sort that would bestow dog-like devotion upon one who was more
powerful than he, for he worships physical prowess."</p>

<p><br>
At the palace of Thudos the two men were ushered into a magnificent
apartment by a slave, after the guard at the entrance had
recognized Gemnon and permitted them to pass. In the soft light of
a dozen cressets they awaited the coming of the daughter of the
house to whom the slave carried Gemnon's ring to evidence the
identity of her caller.</p>

<p>The light fall of soft sandals upon stone announced the coming
of their hostess, and both men turned toward the doorway leading
into a small open garden from which she was coming. Tarzan saw a
girl of exquisite beauty; but if she were more beautiful than
Nemone he could not say; there are so many things that enter into
the making of a beautiful countenance. Yet he acknowledged to
himself that Thudos was wise in keeping her hidden from the queen.
She greeted Gemnon with the sweet familiarity of an old friend, and
when Tarzan was present her manner was cordial and unaffected, yet
always the fact that she was the daughter of Thudos seemed a part
of her.</p>

<p>The three spent the evening in pleasant conversation, and Gemnon
and Tarzan were about to leave, when a middle-aged man entered the
room. It was Thudos, the father of Doria. He greeted Gemnon
cordially and seemed pleased to meet Tarzan, whom he immediately
commenced to question relative to the world outside the valleys of
Onthar and Thenar.</p>

<p>Thudos was a strikingly handsome man, with strong features, an
athletic build, and eyes that were serious and stern that yet had
wrinkles at their corners that betokened much laughter. His was a
face that one might trust, for integrity, loyalty, and courage had
left their imprints plainly upon it, at least for eyes as observant
as those of the Lord of the Jungle.</p>

<p>When the two guests rose to leave again, Thudos seemed satisfied
with his appraisal of the stranger. "I am glad that Gemnon brought
you," he said. "The very fact that he did convinces me that he has
confidence in your friendship and loyalty, for, as you may already
know, the position of my house at the court of Nemone is such that
we receive only assured friends within our walls."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied the ape-man. He made no other reply, but
both Thudos and Doria felt that here was a man who might be
trusted.</p>

<p>As the two men entered the avenue in front of the palace of
their host, a figure slunk into the shadow of a tree a few paces
from them, and neither saw it. Then they walked leisurely toward
their apartments in the palace.</p>

<p>"Doria said she saw my meeting with Phobeg in the arena,"
remarked Tarzan. "I have been curious to ask you how she dared come
to the stadium when her life is constantly in danger should her
beauty become known to the queen?"</p>

<p>"She is always disguised when she goes abroad," replied Gemnon.
"A few touches by an expert hand and hollows appear in her cheeks
and beneath her eyes, her brow is wrinkled, and behold! She is no
longer the most beautiful woman in the world. Nemone would not give
her a second thought if she saw her, but still care is taken to see
that Nemone does not see her too closely even then. It is informers
we fear the most. Thudos never sells a slave who has seen Doria,
and once a new slave enters the palace walls he never leaves them
again until long years of service have proved him, and his loyalty
is unquestioned. It is a monotonous life for Doria, the penalty she
pays for beauty, but all that we can do is hope and pray that
relief will come some day in the death of Nemone or the elevation
of Alextar to the throne."</p>

<p><br>
Valthor was asleep on Tarzan's couch when the ape-man entered his
bedroom. He had had little rest since his capture, and, in
addition, he was suffering from a slight wound, so Tarzan moved
softly that he might not disturb him and made no light in the room,
the darkness of which was partially dispelled by moonlight.</p>

<p>Spreading some skins on the floor against the wall opposite the
window, the ape-man lay down and was soon asleep, while in the
apartment above him two men crouched in the dark beside the window
that was directly above that in Tarzan's bedroom.</p>

<p>For a long time they crouched there in silence. One was a large,
powerful man, the other smaller and lighter.</p>

<p>Fully an hour passed before either moved other than to change a
cramped position for one more comfortable. Then the smaller man
arose. One end of a long rope was knotted about his body beneath
his armpits; in his right he carried a slim dagger-sword.</p>

<p>Cautiously and silently he went to the window and looked out,
his careful gaze searching the grounds below. Then he sat on the
sill and swung his legs through the window. The larger man, holding
the rope firmly with both hands, braced himself. The smaller turned
over on his belly and slid out of the window. Hand over hand, the
other lowered him; his head disappeared below the sill.</p>

<p>Very carefully, so as to make no noise, the larger man lowered
the smaller until the feet of the latter rested on the sill of
Tarzan's bedroom window. Here the man reached in and took hold of
the casing; then he jerked twice upon the rope to acquaint his
fellow with the fact that he had reached his destination safely and
the other let the rope slip through his fingers loosely as the
movements of the man below dragged it slowly out.</p>

<p>The smaller man stepped gingerly to the floor inside the room.
Without hesitation he moved toward the bed, his weapon raised and
ready in his hand. He made no haste; his one purpose for the
present appeared to be the achievement of absolute silence. It was
evident that he feared to waken the sleeper. Even when he reached
the bed he stood there for a long time searching with his eyes for
the right spot to strike that the blow might bring instant death.
The assassin knew that Gemnon slept in another bedroom across the
living room; what he did not know was that Valthor, the Athnean,
lay stretched on the bed beneath his keen weapon.</p>

<p>As the assassin hesitated, Tarzan of the Apes opened his eyes.
Though the intruder had made no sound his mere presence in the room
had aroused the ape-man; perhaps the effluvium from his body,
reaching the sensitive nostrils of the sleeping beast-man, carried
the same message to the alert brain that sound would have
carried.</p>

<p>At the instant that Tarzan opened his eyes he saw the stranger
in the room, saw the dagger raised above the form of the sleeping
Valthor, read the whole story in a single glance, and in the same
moment arose and leaped upon the unsuspecting murderer, who was
dragged back from his victim at the very instant that his weapon
was descending.</p>

<p>As the two men crashed to the floor, Valthor awoke and sprang
from his cot; but by the time he had discovered what was
transpiring, the would-be assassin lay dead upon the floor, and
Tarzan of the Apes stood with one foot upon the body of his kill.
For an instant the ape-man hesitated, his face upturned as the
weird scream of the victorious bull ape trembled on his lips, but
then he shook his head, and only a low growl rumbled upward from
the deep chest.</p>

<p>Valthor had heard these growls before and was neither surprised
nor shocked. The man in the room above had heard only beast growls,
and the sound made him hesitate and wonder. He had heard, too, the
crash of the two bodies as Tarzan had hurled the other to the
floor, and while he had not interpreted that correctly it had
suggested resistance and put him on his guard. Cautiously he
stepped closer to the window and looked out, listening.</p>

<p>In the room below, Tarzan of the Apes seized the corpse of the
man who had come to kill him and hurled it through the window into
the grounds beneath. The man above saw and, turning, slunk from the
room and vanished among the dark shadows of the palace corridors.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; THE GRAND HUNT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WITH the breaking of dawn Tarzan and Valthor
arose, for the latter was to set out upon his journey to Athne
early. The previous evening a slave had been directed to serve
breakfast at daybreak, and the two men now heard him arranging the
table in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>"We have met again, and again we part," commented Valthor as he
fastened his sandal straps to the ivory guards that encircled his
ankles. "I wish that you were going with me to Athne, my
friend."</p>

<p>"I would go with you were it not for the fact that Gemnon's life
would be forfeited should I leave Cathne while he is responsible
for me," replied the ape-man, "but you may rest assured that some
day I shall pay you a visit in Athne."</p>

<p>"I never expected to see you alive again after we were separated
by the flood," continued Valthor, "and when I realized you were in
the lion pit I could not believe my own eyes. Four times at least
have you saved my life, Tarzan. You may be assured of a warm
welcome in the house of my father at Athne whenever you come."</p>

<p>"The debt, if you feel that there was one, is wiped out," Tarzan
assured him, "since you saved my life last night by sleeping in my
bed."</p>

<p>"What saved whose life?" demanded a voice at the door.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Gemnon!" greeted Tarzan. "My compliments and
congratulations!"</p>

<p>"Thanks! But what about?" demanded the Cathnean.</p>

<p>"Upon your notable ability as a sound sleeper," explained
Tarzan, smiling.</p>

<p>Gemnon shook his head dubiously. "Your words are beyond me. What
are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"You slept last night through an attempted assassination, the
killing of the culprit, and the disposition of his body. Phobeg's
warning was no idle gossip."</p>

<p>"You mean that someone came here last night to kill you?"</p>

<p>"And almost killed Valthor instead," and then Tarzan briefly
narrated the events of the attempt upon his life.</p>

<p>"Had you ever seen the man before?" asked Gemnon. "Did you
recognize him?"</p>

<p>"I paid little attention to him," admitted Tarzan; "I threw him
out of the window. But I do not recall having seen him before."</p>

<p>"Was he a noble?"</p>

<p>"No, he was a common warrior. Perhaps you will recognize him
when you see him."</p>

<p>"I shall have to have a look at him and report the matter at
once," said Gemnon. "Nemone is going to be furious when she hears
this."</p>

<p>"She may have instigated it herself," suggested Tarzan. "She is
half-mad."</p>

<p>"Hush!" cautioned Gemnon. "It is death even to whisper that
thought. No, I do not believe it was Nemone, but were you to accuse
Erot, M'duze, or Tomos I could easily agree to that. I must go now,
and if I do not return before you leave, Valthor, be assured that I
have enjoyed entertaining you. It is unfortunate that we are
enemies and that the next time we meet we shall have to endeavor to
take one another's head."</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate and foolish," replied Valthor.</p>

<p>"But it is the custom," Gemnon reminded him.</p>

<p>"Then may we never meet, for I could never take pleasure in
killing you."</p>

<p>"Here's to it, then," cried Gemnon, raising his hand as though
it held a drinking horn. "May we never meet again!" And with that
he turned and left them.</p>

<p>Tarzan and Valthor had but scarcely finished their meal when a
noble arrived to tell them that Valthor's escort was ready to
depart, and a moment later, with a brief farewell, the Athnean
left.</p>

<p>By Nemone's command the ape-man's weapons had been returned to
him, and he was engaged in inspecting them, looking to the points
and feathers of his arrows, his bowstring, and his grass rope, when
Gemnon returned. The Cathnean was quite evidently angry and not a
little excited. This was one of the few occasions upon which Tarzan
had seen his warder other than smiling and affable.</p>

<p>"I have had a bad half hour with the queen," explained Gemnon.
"I was lucky to get away with my life. She is furious over this
attempt upon your life and blames me for neglect of duty. What am I
to do? Sit on your window sill all night?"</p>

<p>Tarzan laughed. "I am an embarrassment," he said lightly, "and I
am sorry. But how can I help it? It was an accident that brought me
here; it is perversity that keeps me, the perversity of a spoiled
woman."</p>

<p>"You had better not tell her that, or let other than me hear you
say it," Gemnon cautioned him.</p>

<p>"I may tell her," laughed Tarzan. "I am afraid I never acquired
that entirely human accomplishment called diplomacy."</p>

<p>"She has sent me to summon you, and I warn you to exercise a
little judgment, even though you have no diplomacy. She is like a
raging lion, and whoever arouses her further will be in for a
mauling."</p>

<p>"What does she want of me?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Am I to remain in this house, caged up like a pet dog, to run
at the beck of a woman?"</p>

<p>"She is investigating this attempt on your life and has summoned
others to be questioned," Gemnon explained.</p>

<p>Gemnon led the way to a large audience chamber where the nobles
of the court were congregated before a massive throne on which the
queen sat, her beautiful brows contracted in a frown. As Tarzan and
Gemnon entered the room, she looked up; but she did not smile. A
noble advanced and led the two men to seats near the foot of the
throne.</p>

<p>As Tarzan glanced about at the faces of those near him, he saw
Tomos, and Erot, and Xerstle. Erot was nervous; he fidgeted
constantly upon his bench; he played with his fingers and with the
hilt of his sword.</p>

<p>"We have been awaiting you," said the queen as Tarzan took his
seat. "It appears that you did not exert yourself to hasten in
response to our command."</p>

<p>Tarzan looked up at her with an amused smile. "On the contrary,
your majesty, I returned at once with the noble Gemnon," he
explained respectfully.</p>

<p>"We have summoned you to tell the story of what happened in your
apartment last night that resulted in the killing of a warrior."
She then turned to a noble standing at her side and whispered a few
words in his ear, whereupon the man quit the room. "You may
proceed," she said, turning again to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"There is little to tell," replied the ape-man, rising.</p>

<p>"A man came to my room to kill me, but I killed him
instead."</p>

<p>"How did he enter your room?" demanded Nemone.</p>

<p>"Where was Gemnon? Did he admit the fellow?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied Tarzan. "Gemnon was asleep in his own
room. The man who would have killed me was lowered from the window
of the apartment above mine and entered through my window. There
was a long rope tied about his body."</p>

<p>"How did you know he came to kill you? Did he attack you?"</p>

<p>"Valthor, the Athnean, was sleeping in my bed; I was sleeping on
the floor. The man did not see me, for the room was dark. He went
to the bed where he thought I was sleeping. I awoke as he stood
over Valthor, his sword raised in his hand ready to strike. Then I
killed him and threw his body out of the window."</p>

<p>"Did you recognize him? Had you ever seen him before?" asked the
queen.</p>

<p>"I did not recognize him."</p>

<p>There was a noise at the entrance to the audience chamber that
caused Nemone to glance up. Four slaves bore a stretcher into the
room and laid it at the foot of the throne; on it was the corpse of
a man.</p>

<p>"Is this the fellow who attempted your life?" demanded
Nemone.</p>

<p>"It is," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly upon Erot. "Did you ever see this man
before?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Erot arose. He was white and trembled a little. "But, your
majesty, he is only a common warrior," he countered.</p>

<p>"I may have seen him often, yet have forgotten him; that would
not be strange, I see so many of them."</p>

<p>"And you," the queen addressed a young noble standing near,
"have you ever seen this man before?"</p>

<p>"Often," replied the noble. "He was a member of the palace guard
and in my company."</p>

<p>"How long has he been attached to the palace?" demanded
Nemone.</p>

<p>"Not a month, your majesty."</p>

<p>"And before that? Do you know anything about his prior
service?"</p>

<p>"He was attached to the retinue of a noble, your majesty,"
replied the young officer hesitantly.</p>

<p>"What noble?" demanded Nemone.</p>

<p>"Erot," replied the witness in a low voice.</p>

<p>The queen looked long and searchingly at Erot. "You have a short
memory," she said presently, an undisguised sneer in her voice.</p>

<p>Erot was pale and shaken. He looked long at the face of the dead
man before he spoke again. "I do recall him now, your majesty, but
he does not look the same. Death has changed him; that is why I did
not recognize him immediately."</p>

<p>"You are lying," snapped Nemone. "There are some things about
this affair that I do not understand. What part you have had in it,
I do not know, but I am sure that you had some part, and I am going
to find out what.</p>

<p>"In the meantime you are banished from the palace. There may be
others," she looked meaningfully at Tomos, "but I shall find them
all out and, when I do, it will be the lion pit for the lot!"</p>

<p>Rising, she descended from the throne, and all knelt save
Tarzan. As she passed him on her way from the chamber, she paused
and looked long and searchingly into his eyes. "Be careful," she
whispered; "your life is in danger. I dare not see you for a while,
for there is one so desperate that not even I could protect you
should you visit my apartments again. Tell Gemnon to quit the
palace and take you to his father's house. You will be safer there,
but even then far from safe. In a few days I shall have removed the
obstacles that stand between us. Until then, Tarzan, good-bye!"</p>

<p>The ape-man bowed, and the queen of Cathne passed on out of the
audience chamber. The nobles rose. They drew away from Erot and
clustered about Tarzan. In disgust the ape-man drew away. "Come,
Gemnon," he said. "There is nothing to keep us here longer."</p>

<p>Xerstle blocked their way as they were leaving the chamber.
"Everything is ready for the grand hunt!" he exclaimed, rubbing his
palms together genially. "I thought this tiresome audience would
prevent our starting today, but it is still early. The lions and
the quarry are awaiting us at the edge of the forest. Get your
weapon, and join me in the avenue."</p>

<p>Gemnon hesitated. "Who are hunting with you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just you and Tarzan and Pindes," explained Xerstle, "a small
and select company that ensures a good hunt."</p>

<p>"We will come," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>As the two returned to their quarters to get their weapons,
Gemnon appeared worried. "I am not sure that it is wise to go," he
said.</p>

<p>"And why not?" inquired Tarzan.</p>

<p>"This may be another trap for you."</p>

<p>The ape-man shrugged. "It is quite possible, but I cannot remain
cooped up in hiding. I should like to see what a grand hunt is; I
have heard the term often since I came to Cathne. Who is Pindes? I
do not recall him."</p>

<p>"He was an officer of the guard when Erot became the queen's
favorite, but through Erot he was dismissed. He is not a bad fellow
but weak and easily influenced; however, he must hate Erot, and so
I think you have nothing to fear from him."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to fear from anyone," Tarzan assured him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think not, but be on guard."</p>

<p>"I am always on guard; had I not been I should have been dead
long ago."</p>

<p>"Your self-complacency may be your undoing," growled Gemnon
testily.</p>

<p>Tarzan laughed. "I appreciate both danger and my own
limitations, but I cannot let fear rob me of my liberty and
pleasures of life. Fear is to be more dreaded than death. You are
afraid, Erot is afraid, Nemone is afraid; and are all unhappy. Were
I afraid, I should be unhappy but no safer. I prefer to be simply
cautious.</p>

<p>"And by the way, speaking of caution, Nemone instructed me to
tell you to take me from the palace and keep me in your father's
house. She says the palace is no safe place for me. I really think
that it is M'duze who is after me."</p>

<p>"M'duze and Erot and Tomos," said Gemnon; "there is a
triumvirate of greed and malice and duplicity that I should hate to
have upon my trail."</p>

<p><br>
At his quarters, Gemnon gave orders that his and Tarzan's
belongings be moved to the house of his father while the two men
were hunting; then they went to the avenue where they found Xerstle
and Pindes awaiting them. The latter was a man of about thirty,
rather good looking but with a weak face and eyes that invariably
dropped from a direct gaze. He met Tarzan with great cordiality,
and as the four men walked along the main avenue of the city toward
the eastern gate he was most affable.</p>

<p>Beyond the eastern gate an open parklike plain stretched for a
short distance to the forest. Near the gate four stalwart slaves
held two lions in leash, while a fifth man, naked but for a dirty
loin-cloth, squatted upon the ground a short distance away.</p>

<p>As the four hunters approached the party, Xerstle explained to
Tarzan that the leashed beasts were his hunting lions, and as the
ape-man's observant eyes ran over the five men who were to
accompany them on the hunt he recognized the stalwart black seated
upon the ground apart as the man he had seen upon the auction block
in the market-place. Xerstle approached the fellow and spoke
briefly with him, evidently giving him orders.</p>

<p>When Xerstle had finished, the black started off at a trot
across the plain in the direction of the forest. Everyone watched
his progress.</p>

<p>"Why is he running ahead?" asked Tarzan. "He will frighten away
the quarry."</p>

<p>Pindes laughed. "He is the quarry."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" demanded Tarzan with a scowl.</p>

<p>"That this is a grand hunt," cried Xerstle, "where we hunt man,
the grandest quarry."</p>

<p>"What happens if you do not get him? Is he free then?"</p>

<p>"I should say not; not if we can capture him again," cried
Xerstle. "Slaves cost too much money to be lightly thrown away like
that."</p>

<p>When the native reached the forest, Xerstle spoke a word of
command to the keepers and they unleashed the two great beasts. The
lions bounded away in pursuit of the quarry.</p>

<p>Halfway to the forest the lions settled down to a slower gait,
and the hunters commenced gradually to overhaul them. Xerstle and
Pindes appeared excited, far more excited than the circumstances of
the hunt warranted; Gemnon was silent and thoughtful; Tarzan was
disgusted and bored. But before they reached the forest his
interest was aroused, for a plan had occurred to him whereby he
might derive some pleasure from the day's sport.</p>

<p>The wood, which the hunters presently entered a short distance
behind the lions, was of extraordinary beauty. The trees were very
old and gave evidence of having received the intelligent care of
man, as did the floor of the forest. There was little or no
deadwood in the trees, and only occasional clumps of underbrush
upon the ground between them. As far as Tarzan could see among the
boles of the trees, the aspect was that of a well-kept park rather
than of a natural wood, and in answer to a comment he made upon
this fact Gemnon explained that for ages his people had given
regular attention to the conservation of this forest from the city
of gold to the Pass of the Warriors.</p>

<p>Once within the forest, Tarzan dropped gradually to the rear of
the party, and then, when none was looking, swung into the branches
of a tree. Plain to his nostrils had been the scent spoor of the
quarry from the beginning of the chase and now the ape-man knew,
possibly even better than the lions, the direction of the hopeless
flight of the man.</p>

<p>Swinging through the trees in a slight detour that carried him
around and beyond the hunters without revealing his desertion to
them, Tarzan sped through the middle terraces of the forest as only
the Lord of the Jungle can. Stronger and stronger in his nostrils
waxed the scent of the quarry; behind him came the lions and the
hunters.</p>

<p>And he knew that he must act quickly, for they were no great
distance in his rear. A grim smile lighted his gray eyes as he
considered the denouement of the project he had undertaken.</p>

<p>Presently he saw the native running through the forest just
ahead of him. The fellow was moving at a dogged trot, casting an
occasional glance behind him.</p>

<p>Tarzan was directly above the man now, and he spoke to him in
the language of his people. "Take to the trees," he called
down.</p>

<p>The native looked up, but he did not stop. "Who are you?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"An enemy of your master, who would help you escape," replied
the ape-man.</p>

<p>"There is no escape; if I take to the trees they will stone me
down."</p>

<p>"They will not find you; I will see to that."</p>

<p>"Why should you help me?" demanded the man, but he stopped now
and looked up again, searching for the man whose voice came down to
him in a tongue that gave him confidence in the speaker.</p>

<p>"I have told you that I am an enemy of your master."</p>

<p>Now the native saw the bronzed figure of the giant above him.
"You are a white man!" he exclaimed. "You are trying to trick me.
Why should a white man help me?"</p>

<p>"Hurry!" admonished Tarzan, "or it will be too late, and no one
can help you."</p>

<p>For just an instant longer the native hesitated; then he leaped
for a low-hanging branch and swung himself up into the tree as
Tarzan came down to meet him.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE PLOT THAT
FAILED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SWIFTLY, the giant of the jungle bore the Galla
slave toward the east where, beyond the forest, loomed the
mountains that hemmed Onthar upon that side. For a mile he carried
him through the trees and then swung lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>"If the lions ever pick up your trail now," he said, "it will
not be until long after you have reached the mountains and safety.
But do not delay&mdash;go now."</p>

<p>The man fell upon his knees and took the hand of his savior in
his own. "I am Hafim," he said. "If I could serve you, I would die
for you. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes. Now go your way and lose no time."</p>

<p>"One more favor," begged the native.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I have a brother. He, too, was captured by these when they
captured me. He is a slave in the gold mines south of Cathne. His
name is Niaka. If you should go to the gold mines, tell him that
Hafim has escaped."</p>

<p>"I shall tell him. Now go."</p>

<p>Silently the native disappeared among the boles of the forest
trees, and Tarzan sprang again into the branches and swung rapidly
back in the direction of the hunters. When he reached them,
dropping to the ground and approaching them from behind, they were
clustered near the spot at which Hafim had taken to the trees.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" asked Xerstle. "We thought that you had
become lost."</p>

<p>"I dropped behind," replied the ape-man. "Where is your quarry?
I thought that you would have had him by this time."</p>

<p>"We cannot understand it," admitted Xerstle. "It is evident that
he climbed this tree, because the lions followed him to this very
spot, where they stood looking up into the tree; but they did not
growl as though they saw the man. Then we leashed them again and
sent one of the keepers into the tree, but he saw no sign of the
quarry."</p>

<p>"It is a mystery!" exclaimed Pindes.</p>

<p>"It is indeed," agreed Tarzan; "at least for those who do not
know the secret."</p>

<p>"Who does know the secret?" demanded Xerstle.</p>

<p>"The black slave who has escaped you must know, if no
other."</p>

<p>"He has not escaped me," snapped Xerstle. "He has but prolonged
the hunt and increased its interest. Come, let us go. I shall hunt
with Gemnon and Pindes with Tarzan. We shall take one lion, they
the other."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But I am responsible to the queen for the safe return of
Tarzan," demurred Gemnon. "I do not like to have him out of my
sight even for a short time."</p>

<p>"I promise that I shall not try to escape," the ape-man assured
him.</p>

<p>"It was not that alone of which I was thinking," explained
Gemnon.</p>

<p>"And I can assure you that I can take care of myself, if you
feel fears for my safety," added Tarzan.</p>

<p>Reluctantly Gemnon assented to the arrangement, and presently
the two parties separated, Xerstle and Gemnon going towards the
northwest while Pindes and Tarzan took an easterly direction. The
latter had proceeded but a short distance, the lion still upon its
leash, when Pindes suggested that they separate, spreading out
through the forest, and thus combing it more carefully.</p>

<p>"You go straight east," he said to Tarzan, "the keepers and the
lion will go northeast, and I will go north. If any comes upon the
trail he may shout to attract the others to his position. If we
have not located the quarry in an hour let us all converge toward
the mountains at the eastern side of the forest."</p>

<p>The ape-man nodded and started off in the direction assigned
him, soon disappearing among the trees. But neither Pindes nor the
keepers moved from where he had left them, the keepers held by a
whispered word from Pindes. The leashed lion looked after the
departing ape-man, and Pindes smiled. The keepers looked at him
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Such sad accidents have happened many times before," said
Pindes.</p>

<p><br>
Tarzan moved steadily toward the east. Presently he heard a noise
behind him and glancing back was not surprised by what he saw. A
lion was stalking him, a lion wearing the harness of a hunting lion
of Cathne. It was one of Xerstle's lions; it was the same lion that
had accompanied Pindes and Tarzan.</p>

<p>Instantly the ape-man guessed the truth, and a grim light
glinted in his eyes. It was no light of anger, but there was
disgust in it and the shadowy suggestion of a savage smile. The
lion, realizing that its quarry had discovered it, began to roar.
In the distance Pindes heard and smiled.</p>

<p>"Let us go now," he said to the keepers. "We must not find the
remains too quickly; that might not look well."</p>

<p>The three men moved slowly off toward the north.</p>

<p><br>
From a distance Gemnon and Xerstle heard the roar of the hunting
lion. "They have picked up the trail." said Gemnon, halting; "we
had best join them."</p>

<p>"Not yet," demurred Xerstle. "It may be a false trail. We will
wait until we hear the hunters call." But Gemnon was troubled.</p>

<p><br>
Tarzan stood awaiting the coming of the lion. He could have taken
to the trees and escaped, but a spirit of bravado prompted him to
remain. He hated treachery, and exposing it gave him pleasure. He
carried a Cathnean spear and his own hunting knife; his bow and
arrows he had left behind.</p>

<p>The lion came nearer; it seemed vaguely disturbed. Perhaps it
did not understand why the quarry stood and faced it instead of
running away. Its tail twitched; its head was flattened; slowly it
came on again, its wicked eyes gleaming angrily.</p>

<p>Tarzan waited. In his right hand was the sturdy Cathnean spear,
in his left his hunting knife. He measured the distance with a
trained eye as the lion started its swift, level charge; then, when
it was coming at full speed, his spear hand flew back and he
launched the heavy weapon.</p>

<p>Deep beneath the left shoulder it drove, deep into the savage
heart, but it checked the beast's charge for but an instant.
Infuriated now, the carnivore rose upon its hind legs above the
ape-man, its great, taloned paws reaching to drag him to the
slavering jowls; but Tarzan, swift as Ara the lightning, stooped
and sprang beneath them, sprang to one side and then in again,
closing with the lion, leaping upon its back.</p>

<p>With a hideous roar, the animal wheeled and sought to bury its
great fangs in the bronzed body or reach it with those raking
talons. It threw itself to right and left as the creature clinging
to it drove a steel blade repeatedly into the already torn and
bleeding heart.</p>

<p>The vitality and life tenacity of a lion are astounding, but
even that mighty frame could not long withstand the lethal wounds
its adversary had inflicted, and presently it slumped to earth and,
with a little quiver, died.</p>

<p>Then the ape-man leaped to his feet. With one foot upon the
carcass of his kill, Tarzan of the Apes raised his face to the
leafy canopy of the Cathnean forest and from his great chest rolled
the hideous victory cry of the bull ape which has killed.</p>

<p>As the uncanny challenge reverberated down the forest aisles,
Pindes and the two keepers looked questioningly at one another and
laid their hands upon their sword hilts.</p>

<p>"In the name of Thoos! What was that?" demanded one of the
keepers.</p>

<p>"Silence!" admonished Pindes. "Do you want the thing to creep
upon us unheard because of your jabbering!"</p>

<p>"What was it, master?" asked one of the men in a whisper.</p>

<p>"It may have been the death cry of the stranger," suggested
Pindes, voicing the hope that was in his heart.</p>

<p>"It sounded not like a death cry, master," replied the keeper.
"There was a note of strength and elation in it, and none of
weakness and defeat."</p>

<p><br>
At a little distance, Gemnon and Xerstle heard, too. "What was
that?" demanded the latter.</p>

<p>Gemnon shook his head. "I do not know, but we had better go and
find out. I did not like the sound of it."</p>

<p>Xerstle appeared nervous. "It was nothing, perhaps, but the wind
in the trees. Let us go on with our hunting."</p>

<p>"There is no wind," demurred Gemnon. "I am going to investigate.
I am responsible for the safety of the stranger; but, of even more
importance than that, I like him."</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I!" exclaimed Xerstle eagerly. "But nothing could
have happened to him. Pindes is with him."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I was thinking," observed Gemnon.</p>

<p>"That nothing could have happened to him?"</p>

<p>"That Pindes is with him!"</p>

<p>Xerstle shot a quick, suspicious look at the other, motioned to
the keepers to follow with the leashed lion, and fell in behind
Gemnon, who had already started back toward the point at which they
had separated from their companions.</p>

<p><br>
In the meantime Pindes, unable to curb his curiosity, overcame his
fears and started after Tarzan.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when Pindes, who was in the lead, halted
suddenly and pointed straight ahead. "What is that?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>The keepers pressed forward. "Mane of Thoos!" cried one. "It is
the lion!"</p>

<p>They advanced slowly, watching the lion, looking to right and
left. "It is dead!" exclaimed Pindes.</p>

<p>The three men examined the body of the dead beast, turning it
over. "It has been stabbed to death," announced one of the
keepers.</p>

<p>"The Galla slave had no weapon," said Pindes thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"The stranger carried a knife," a keeper reminded him.</p>

<p>"Whoever killed the lion must have fought it hand to hand,"
reflected Pindes aloud.</p>

<p>"Then he must be lying nearby dead or wounded, master."</p>

<p>"He could have killed Phobeg with his bare hands that day that
he threw him into the audience at the stadium," a keeper reminded
the noble. "He carried him around as though Phobeg were a babe. He
is very strong."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with the matter?" demanded Pindes
irritably.</p>

<p>"I do not know, master. I was only thinking."</p>

<p>"I did not tell you to think," snapped Pindes; "I told you to
hunt for the man that killed the lion. He must be dying or dead
nearby."</p>

<p>While they hunted, Xerstle and Gemnon were drawing nearer. The
latter was much concerned about the welfare of his charge. He
trusted neither Xerstle nor Pindes, and now he commenced to suspect
that he and Tarzan had been deliberately separated for sinister
purposes. He was walking a little behind Xerstle at the time; the
keepers, with the lion, were just ahead of them. He felt a hand
upon his shoulder and wheeled about. There stood Tarzan, a smile
upon his lips. "Where did you drop from?" demanded Gemnon.</p>

<p>"We separated to search for the Galla&mdash;Pindes and I,"
explained the ape-man as Xerstle turned at the sound of Gemnon's
voice and discovered him.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that terrible scream a while ago?" demanded
Xerstle. "We thought it possible that one of you was hurt, and we
were hurrying to investigate."</p>

<p>"Did someone scream?" inquired Tarzan innocently. "Perhaps it
was Pindes, for I am not hurt."</p>

<p>Shortly after Tarzan had rejoined them, Xerstle and Gemnon came
upon Pindes and his two lion keepers searching the underbrush and
the surrounding forest.</p>

<p>As his eyes fell upon Tarzan, Pindes's eyes went wide in
astonishment, and he paled a little.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" demanded Xerstle. "What are you looking
for? Where is your lion?"</p>

<p>"He is dead," explained Pindes. "Someone or something stabbed
him to death." He did not look at Tarzan; he feared to do so. "We
have been looking for the man who did it, thinking that he must
have been badly mauled and, doubtless, killed."</p>

<p>"Have you found him?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Shall I help you search for him? Suppose you and I, Pindes, go
away alone and look for him!"</p>

<p>For a moment Pindes seemed choking as he sought for a reply.
"No!" he exclaimed presently. "It would be useless; we have
searched carefully. There is not even a sign of blood to indicate
that he was wounded."</p>

<p>"And you found no trace of the quarry?" asked Xerstle.</p>

<p>"None," replied Pindes. "He has escaped, and we might as well
return to the city. I have had enough hunting for today."</p>

<p>Xerstle only grunted and strode on moodily toward the city. When
the party separated before the house of Gemnon's father, Tarzan
stood close to Xerstle and whispered in a low voice, "My
compliments to Erot, and may he have better luck next time!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; IN THE TEMPLE OF
THOOS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Tarzan sat with Gemnon and the latter's father
and mother at dinner that evening, a slave entered the room to
announce that a messenger had come from the house of Thudos, the
father of Doria, with an important communication for Gemnon.</p>

<p>"Fetch him here," directed the young noble, and a moment later a
tall slave was ushered into the apartment.</p>

<p>"Ah, Gemba!" exclaimed Gemnon in a kindly tone.</p>

<p>"You have a message for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, master," replied the slave, "but it is important&mdash;and
secret."</p>

<p>"You may speak before these others, Gemba," replied Gemnon.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Doria, the daughter of Thudos, my master, has sent me to tell
you that by a ruse the noble Erot gained entrance to her father's
house and spoke with her today. What he said to her was of no
importance; only the fact that he saw her is important."</p>

<p>"The jackal!" exclaimed Gemnon's father.</p>

<p>Gemnon paled. "That is all?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"That is all, master," replied Gemba.</p>

<p>Gemnon took a gold coin from his pocket pouch and handed it to
the slave. "Return to your mistress, and tell her that I shall come
and speak with her father tomorrow." After the slave had withdrawn,
Gemnon looked hopelessly at his father. "What can I do?" he asked.
"What can Thudos do? What can anyone do? We are helpless."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can do something," suggested Tarzan. "For the moment
I seem to hold the confidence of your queen. When I see her I shall
question her, and if it is necessary I shall intercede in your
behalf."</p>

<p>A new hope sprang to Gemnon's eyes. "If you will!" he cried.
"She will listen to you. I believe that you alone might save Doria.
But remember that the queen must not see her."</p>

<p><br>
Early the next morning a messenger from the palace brought a
command to Tarzan to visit the queen at noon, with instructions to
Gemnon to accompany Tarzan with a strong guard as she feared
treachery on the part of Tarzan's enemies.</p>

<p>"They must be powerful enemies that dare attempt to thwart the
wishes of Nemone," commented Gemnon's father.</p>

<p>"There is only one in all Cathne who dares do that," replied
Gemnon, "and that is M'duze."</p>

<p>"Come," he continued, "we have the morning to ourselves. What
shall we do in the meantime?"</p>

<p>"I should like to visit the mines of Cathne," replied Tarzan;
"shall we have time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we shall," replied Gemnon. "The Mine of the Rising Sun is
not far, and as there is little to see after you get there, the
trip will not take long."</p>

<p>On the road from Cathne to the mine, Gemnon pointed out the
place where the war and hunting lions of Cathne were bred; but they
did not stop to visit the place, and presently they were winding up
the short mountain road to the Gold Mine of the Rising Sun.</p>

<p>As Gemnon had warned him, there was little of interest for
Tarzan to see. The workings were open, the mother lode lying
practically upon the surface of the ground. So rich was it that
only a few slaves working with crude picks and bars were needed to
supply the coffers of Cathne with vast quantities of the precious
metal. But it was not the mines nor gold that had caused Tarzan to
wish to visit the diggings. He had promised Hafim that he would
carry a message to his brother Niaka, and it was for this purpose
that he had suggested the visit.</p>

<p>As he moved about among the slaves, ostensibly inspecting the
lode, he finally succeeded in separating himself sufficiently from
Gemnon and the warriors who guarded the workers to permit him to
speak unnoticed to one of the slaves.</p>

<p>"Which is Niaka?" he asked in Galla, lowering his voice to a
whisper.</p>

<p>The man looked up in surprise, but at a warning gesture from
Tarzan bent his head again and answered in a whisper, "Niaka is the
big man at my right. He is headman; you see that he does not
work."</p>

<p>Tarzan moved then in the direction of Niaka, and, when he was
close, stopped beside him and leaned as though inspecting the lode
that was uncovered at his feet.</p>

<p>"Listen," he whispered. "I bring you a message, but let no one
know that I am talking to you. It is from your brother Hafim. He
has escaped."</p>

<p>"How?" whispered Niaka.</p>

<p>Briefly, Tarzan explained.</p>

<p>"It was you, then, who saved him?"</p>

<p>The ape-man nodded.</p>

<p>"I am only a poor slave," said Niaka, "and you are a powerful
noble, no doubt, so I can never repay you. But should you ever need
any service that Niaka can render, you have but to command; with my
life I would serve you. In that hut I live with my woman; because I
am headman I am trusted and thus live alone. If you ever want me
you will find me there."</p>

<p>"I ask no return for what I did," replied Tarzan, "but I shall
remember where you live; one never knows what the future holds." He
moved away then and joined Gemnon, and presently the two turned
back toward the city, while in the palace of the queen, Tomos
entered the apartment of Nemone and knelt.</p>

<p>"What now?" she demanded. "Is the affair so urgent that I must
be interrupted at my toilet?"</p>

<p>"It is, majesty," replied the councilor, "and I beg that you
send your slaves away. What I have to say is for your ears
alone."</p>

<p>Nemone dismissed the girls. Then she turned to the councilor,
who had arisen. "Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Your majesty has long had reason to suspect the loyalty of
Thudos," Tomos reminded her, "and in the interest of your majesty's
welfare and the safety of the throne, I am constantly watchful of
the activities of this powerful enemy. Spurred on by love and
loyalty, the noble Erot has been my most faithful agent and ally,
and it is really to him that we owe the information that I bring
you."</p>

<p>Nemone tapped her sandaled foot impatiently upon the mosaic
floor. "Have done with the self-serving preamble, and tell me what
you have to tell me," she snapped.</p>

<p>"Briefly, then, it is this: Gemnon conspires also with Thudos,
hoping, doubtless, that his reward will be the beautiful daughter
of his chief."</p>

<p>"That hollow-cheeked strumpet!" exclaimed Nemone. "Who said she
was beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Erot tells me that Gemnon and Thudos believe her the most
beautiful woman in the world," replied Tomos.</p>

<p>"There are others who think so, too," he added.</p>

<p>"What others?"</p>

<p>"I but hesitated to name the other for fear of wounding your
majesty," said Tomos oilily, "but if you insist, it is the stranger
called Tarzan."</p>

<p>Nemone sat up very straight. "What fabric of lies is this you
and M'duze are weaving?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"It is no lie, majesty. Tarzan and Gemnon were seen coming from
the house of Thudos late at night. Erot had followed them there. He
saw them go in, and they were there a long while. Hiding in the
shadows across the avenue, he saw them come out. He says that they
were quarreling over Doria, and he believes that it was Gemnon who
sought the life of Tarzan because of jealousy."</p>

<p>Nemone sat straight and stiff upon her couch; her face was pale
and tense with fury. "Someone shall die for this," she said in a
low voice. "Go!"</p>

<p>Tomos backed from the room. He was elated until he had time to
reflect more fully upon her words; then he reflected that Nemone
had not stated explicitly who should die.</p>

<p><br>
It was almost noon when Tarzan and Gemnon returned to the city, and
time for the latter to conduct Tarzan to his audience with Nemone.
With a guard of warriors they went to the palace, where the ape-man
was immediately admitted alone into the presence of the queen.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at her in surprise; then he smiled. "I visited the
Mine of the Rising Sun."</p>

<p>"Where were you last night?"</p>

<p>"At the house of Gemnon," he replied.</p>

<p>"You were with Doria!" accused Nemone.</p>

<p>"No," said the ape-man; "that was the night before."</p>

<p>He had been surprised by the accusation and the knowledge that
it connoted, but he did not let her see that he was surprised. He
was not thinking of himself but of Doria and Gemnon, seeking a plan
whereby he might protect them. It was evident that some enemy had
turned informer and that Nemone already knew of the visit to the
house of Thudos. Therefore, he felt that it would but have aroused
the queen's suspicions to have denied it; to admit it freely, to
show that he sought to conceal nothing, would allay them. As a
matter of fact Tarzan's frank and ready reply left Nemone rather
flat.</p>

<p>"Why did you go to the house of Thudos?" she asked, but this
time her tone was not accusing.</p>

<p>"You see, Gemnon does not dare to leave me alone for fear that I
shall escape or that something may befall me, and so he is forced
to take me wherever he goes. It is rather hard on him, Nemone, and
I have been intending to ask you to make someone else responsible
for me for at least a part of the time."</p>

<p>"We will speak of that later," replied the queen. "Why does
Gemnon go to the house of Thudos?" Nemone's eyes narrowed
suspiciously.</p>

<p>The ape-man smiled. "What a foolish question for a woman to
ask!" he exclaimed. "Gemnon is in love with Doria. I thought all
Cathne knew that; he certainly takes enough pains to tell all his
acquaintances."</p>

<p>"You are sure that it is not you who are in love with her?"
demanded Nemone.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at her with disgust he made no effort to conceal.
"Do not be a fool, Nemone," he said. "I do not like fool
women."</p>

<p>The jaw of the queen of Cathne dropped. In all her life no one
had ever addressed her in words or tones like these.</p>

<p>When she spoke again, she had regained her calm. "I was told
that you loved her," she explained, "but I did not believe it. Is
she very beautiful? I have heard that she is considered the most
beautiful woman in Cathne."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Gemnon thinks so," replied Tarzan with a laugh, "but
you know what love does to the eyes of youth."</p>

<p>"What do you think of her?" demanded the queen.</p>

<p>The ape-man shrugged. "She is not bad looking," he said.</p>

<p>"Is she as beautiful as Nemone?" demanded the queen.</p>

<p>"As the brilliance of a far star is to the brilliance of the
sun."</p>

<p>The reply appeared to please Nemone. She arose and came closer
to Tarzan. There was a rattling of chains at the far end of the
room, followed by a terrific roar as Belthar sprang to his feet.
Nemone shrank suddenly away from the ape-man, a shudder ran through
her body, and an expression, half fright, half anger, suffused her
face.</p>

<p>"It is always something," she said irritably, trembling a
little. "Belthar is jealous. There is a strange bond linking the
life of that beast to my life. I do not know what it is; I wish I
did." A light, almost of madness, glittered in her eyes. "But this
I know: when Belthar dies, I die!"</p>

<p>She looked up rather sadly at Tarzan as again her mood changed.
"Come, my friend," she said. "We shall go to the temple together
and perhaps Thoos may answer the questions that are in the heart of
Nemone." She struck a bronze disc that depended from the ceiling,
and as the brazen notes reverberated in the room, a door opened and
a noble bowed low upon the threshold.</p>

<p>"The guard!" commanded the queen. "We are visiting Thoos in his
temple."</p>

<p>The progress to the temple was in the nature of a
pageant&mdash;marching warriors with pennons streaming from spear
tips, nobles resplendent in gorgeous trappings, the queen in a
golden chariot drawn by lions. Tomos walked upon one side of the
glittering car, Tarzan upon the other where Erot had previously
walked.</p>

<p>The ape-man was as uneasy as a forest lion as he strode between
the lines of gaping citizenry. Crowds annoyed and irritated him;
formalities irked him. His thoughts were far away in the distant
jungle that he loved. He knew that Gemnon was nearby watching him,
but whether he was nearby or not, Tarzan would not attempt to
escape this friend who was responsible for him. His mind occupied
with such thoughts, he spoke to the queen.</p>

<p>"At the palace," he reminded her, "I spoke to you concerning the
matter of relieving Gemnon of the irksome job of watching me."</p>

<p>"Gemnon has acquitted himself well," she replied. "I see no
reason for changing."</p>

<p>"Relieve him then, occasionally," suggested Tarzan. "Let Erot
take his place."</p>

<p>Nemone looked at him in astonishment. "But Erot hates you!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"All the more reason that he would watch me carefully," argued
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"He would probably kill you."</p>

<p>"He would not dare if he knew that he must pay for my death or
escape with his own life," suggested Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You like Gemnon, do you not?" inquired Nemone innocently.</p>

<p>"Very much," the ape-man assured her.</p>

<p>"Then he is the man to watch you, for you would not imperil his
life by escaping while he is responsible." Tarzan smiled inwardly
and said no more. It was evident that Nemone was no fool. He would
have to devise some other plan of escape that would not jeopardize
the safety of his friend.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the temple Phobeg was on guard as a girl
entered to worship. Recognizing the warrior, she greeted him and
paused for a moment's conversation, the royal party having not yet
entered the temple square.</p>

<p>"I have not seen you, to talk with you, for a long time,
Phobeg," she said. "I am glad that you are back again on the temple
guard."</p>

<p>"Thanks to the stranger called Tarzan I am alive and here,"
replied Phobeg.</p>

<p>"I should think that you would hate him!" exclaimed the
girl.</p>

<p>"Not I," cried Phobeg. "I know a better man when I see one. I
admire him. And did he not grant me my life when the crowd screamed
for my death?"</p>

<p>"That is true," admitted the girl. "And now he needs a
friend."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Maluma?" demanded the warrior.</p>

<p>"I was in the adjoining room when Tomos visited the queen this
morning," explained the girl, "and I overheard him tell her that
Thudos and Gemnon and Tarzan were conspiring against her and that
Tarzan loved Doria, the daughter of Thudos."</p>

<p>"How did Tomos know these things?" asked Phobeg.</p>

<p>"Did he offer proof?"</p>

<p>"He said that Erot had watched and had seen Gemnon and Tarzan
visit the house of Thudos," explained Maluma. "He also told her
that Erot had seen Doria and had reported that she was very
beautiful."</p>

<p>Phobeg whistled. "That will be the end of the daughter of
Thudos," he said.</p>

<p>"It will be the end of the stranger, too," prophesied Maluma,
"and I am sorry, for I like him. He is not like the jackal Erot,
whom everyone hates."</p>

<p>"Here comes the queen!" exclaimed Phobeg as the procession
entered the temple square.</p>

<p>Before the temple, Nemone alighted from her chariot and walked
up the broad stairway to the ornate entrance. Behind her were the
priests. Following them came the nobles of the court, the warriors
of the guard remaining in the temple square before the entrance.</p>

<p>The temple was a large three-storied building with a great
central dome, about the interior of which ran galleries at the
second and third stories. The interior of the dome was of gold as
were the pillars that supported the galleries, while the walls of
the building were embellished with colorful mosaics. Directly
opposite the main entrance, on a level with a raised dais, a great
cage was built into a niche, and on either side of the cage was an
altar supporting a lion carved from solid gold. Before the dais was
a stone railing inside of which was a throne and a row of stone
benches facing the cage in the niche.</p>

<p>Nemone advanced and seated herself upon the throne while the
nobles took their places upon the benches. No one paid any
attention to Tarzan, so he remained outside the railing, a mildly
interested spectator.</p>

<p>The high priest began a meaningless singsong chant, in which the
others joined occasionally as though making responses. Nemone
leaned forward eagerly; her eyes were fastened upon the old
lion.</p>

<p>Suddenly the chanting ceased and the queen arose.</p>

<p>"O Thoos!" she cried, her hands outstretched toward the mangy
old carnivore. "Nemone brings you greetings. Receive them from
Nemone and bless her. Give her life and health and happiness; most
of all Nemone prays for happiness. Preserve her friends and destroy
her enemies. And, O Thoos, give her the one thing that she most
desires&mdash;love, the love of the one man in all the world that
Nemone has ever loved!" And the lion glared at her through the
bars.</p>

<p>She spoke as though in a trance, as though oblivious to all else
around her save the god to which she prayed.</p>

<p>Nemone sat, silent and rigid, upon her throne, staring straight
ahead at the lion in the cage. The priests and many of the nobles
were reciting prayers in monotones. It was evident to Tarzan that
they were praying to the lion, for every eye was upon the repulsive
beast. Some of the questions that had puzzled him when he had first
come to Cathne were answered. He understood now the strange oaths
of Phobeg and his statement that he had stepped upon the tail of
Thoos.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned away in disgust and anger and walked from the
temple out into the fresh air and the sunlight, and as he did so a
warrior at the entrance hailed him by name in a whisper. There was
a cautionary warning in the voice that prompted the ape-man to give
no apparent sign of having heard as he turned his eyes casually in
the direction from which the words had come, nor did he betray any
interest when he discovered that it was Phobeg who addressed
him.</p>

<p>Turning slowly, so that his back was toward the warrior, Tarzan
looked back into the temple as though expecting the return of the
royal party. Then he backed to the side of the entrance as one
might who waits and stood so close to Phobeg that the latter might
have touched him by moving his spear hand a couple of inches; but
neither gave any sign of being aware of the identity or presence of
the other.</p>

<p>In a low whisper, through lips that scarcely moved, Phobeg
spoke. "I must speak to you! Come to the rear of the temple two
hours after the sun has set. Do not answer, but if you hear and
will come, turn your head to the right."</p>

<p>As Tarzan gave the assenting signal, the royal party commenced
to file from the temple, and he fell in behind Nemone. The queen
was quiet and moody, as she always was after the temple had aroused
her to religious frenzy; the reaction left her weak and
indifferent. At the palace, she dismissed her following, including
Tarzan, and withdrew to the seclusion of her apartments.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE SECRET OF THE
TEMPLE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER the royal party left the temple, Maluma came
out and paused again to gossip with Phobeg. For some time they
talked before she bid him good-bye and started back toward the
palace. They spoke of many things&mdash;of the man in the secret
prison behind a heavy golden door beneath the temple floor, of Erot
and Tomos, of Nemone and Tarzan, of Gemnon and Doria, and of
themselves. Being human, they talked mostly of themselves. It was
late when Maluma returned to the palace. It was already the evening
meal hour.</p>

<p><br>
In the home of his father, Gemnon paced the floor of the patio as
he awaited the summons to the evening meal.</p>

<p>Seeking to divert Gemnon's mind from his troubles, Tarzan spoke
of the ceremony at the temple, but principally of the temple
itself, praising its beauty, commenting upon its magnificence.</p>

<p>"The temple does hide a real wrong," Gemnon said.</p>

<p>"Somewhere within it is hidden Alextar, the brother of Nemone,
and while he rots there the corrupt Tomos and the cruel M'duze rule
Cathne through the mad Nemone. There are many who would have a
change and place Alextar on the throne, but they fear the wrath of
the terrible triumvirate. So we go on, and nothing is done. Victim
after victim succumbs to the jealousy and fear that constantly
animate the throne.</p>

<p>"We have little hope today; we shall have no hope if the queen
carries out the plan she is believed to be contemplating and
destroys Alextar. There are reasons why it would be to her
advantage to do so, the most important being the right of Alextar
to proclaim himself king should he ever succeed in reaching the
palace.</p>

<p>"If Nemone should die, Alextar would become king, and the
populace would insist that he take his rightful place. For this
reason Tomos and M'duze are anxious to destroy him. It is to
Nemone's credit that she has withstood their arguments for all
these years, steadfastly refusing to destroy Alextar. But if ever
he seriously threatens her powers, he is lost. Rumors that have
reached her ears that a plot has been perfected to place him on the
throne may already have sealed his doom."</p>

<p><br>
During the meal that evening, Tarzan considered plans for visiting
Phobeg at the temple. He wished to go alone but knew that he would
place Gemnon in an embarrassing position should he suggest such a
plan, while to permit the noble to accompany him might not only
seal Phobeg's lips but jeopardize his safety as well. Therefore, he
decided to go secretly.</p>

<p>Following the stratagem he had adopted, he remained in
conversation with Gemnon and his parents until almost two hours
after the sun had set; then he excused himself, saying that he was
tired, and went to the room that had been assigned him. But he did
not tarry there. Instead, he merely crossed the room from the door
to the window and stepped out into the patio upon which it faced.
Here, as throughout the gardens and avenues of the section of the
city occupied by the nobility, grew large, old trees, and a moment
later the Lord of the Jungle was winging through his native element
toward the golden temple of Thoos.</p>

<p>He stopped at last in a tree near the rear of the temple where
he saw the huge and familiar figure of Phobeg waiting in the
shadows below. Soundlessly, the ape-man dropped to the ground in
front of the astonished warrior. "By the great fangs of Thoos!"
ejaculated Phobeg, "but you gave me a start."</p>

<p>"You expected me," was Tarzan's only comment.</p>

<p>"But not from the skies," retorted Phobeg. "However, you are
here and it is well; I have much more to tell you than when I asked
you to come. I have learned more since."</p>

<p>"I am listening," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"A girl in the service of the queen overheard a conversation
between Nemone and Tomos," commenced Phobeg. "Tomos accused you and
Gemnon and Thudos of conspiring against her. Erot spied upon you
and knew of your long visit at the home of Thudos a few nights
since. He also managed to enter the house on some pretext the
following night and saw Doria, the daughter of Thudos. Tomos told
Nemone that Doria was very beautiful and that you were in love with
her.</p>

<p>"Nemone is not yet convinced that you love Doria, but to be on
the safe side she has ordered Tomos to have the girl abducted and
brought to the temple where she will be imprisoned until Nemone
decides upon her fate. She may destroy her, or she may be content
to have her beauty disfigured.</p>

<p>"But what you must know is this: if you give Nemone the
slightest reason to believe that you are conspiring against her or
that you are fond of Doria, she will have you killed. All that I
can do is warn you."</p>

<p>"You warned me once before, did you not," asked Tarzan, "the
night that Gemnon and I went to the house of Thudos?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was I," replied Phobeg.</p>

<p>"Why have you done these things?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Because I owe my life to you," replied the warrior, "and
because I know a man when I see one. If a man can pick Phobeg up
and toss him around as though he were a baby, Phobeg is willing to
be his slave."</p>

<p>"I can only thank you for what you have told me, Phobeg," said
Tarzan. "Now tell me more. If Doria is brought to the temple, where
will she be imprisoned?"</p>

<p>"That is hard to say. Alextar is kept in rooms beneath the floor
of the temple, but there are rooms upon the second and third floors
where a prisoner might be safely confined, especially a woman."</p>

<p>"Could you get word to me if she is arrested?"</p>

<p>"I could try," replied Phobeg.</p>

<p>"Good! Is there anything further?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I shall return to Gemnon and warn him. Perhaps we shall
find a way to pacify Nemone or outwit her."</p>

<p>"Either would be difficult," commented Phobeg, "but good-bye and
good luck!"</p>

<p>Tarzan swung into the tree above the warrior's head and
disappeared among the shadows of the night, while Phobeg shook his
head in wonderment and returned to his quarters in the temple.</p>

<p>The ape-man made his way to his room by the same avenue he had
left it and went immediately to the common living room where the
family ordinarily congregated for the evenings. Here he found
Gemnon's father and mother, but Gemnon was not there.</p>

<p>"You could not sleep?" inquired the mother.</p>

<p>"No," replied the ape-man. "Where is Gemnon?"</p>

<p>"He was summoned to the palace a short time after you went to
your room," explained Gemnon's father.</p>

<p>Announcing that he would wait up until the son returned, Tarzan
remained in the living room in conversation with the parents. He
wondered a little that Gemnon should have been summoned to the
palace at such an hour, and the things that Phobeg had told him
made him a little apprehensive, but he kept his own counsel rather
than frighten his host and hostess.</p>

<p>Scarcely an hour had passed when they heard a summons at the
outer gate, and presently a slave came to announce that a warrior
wished to speak to Tarzan upon a matter of urgent necessity.</p>

<p>The ape-man arose. "I will go outside and see him," he said.</p>

<p>"Be careful," cautioned Gemnon's father. "You have bitter
enemies who would be glad to see you destroyed."</p>

<p>"I shall be careful," Tarzan assured him as he left the room
behind the slave.</p>

<p>At the gate two warriors connected with the house were detaining
a huge man whom Tarzan recognized even from a distance as Phobeg.
"I must speak with you at once and alone," said the latter.</p>

<p>"This man is all right," Tarzan told the guards. "Let him enter
and I will talk with him in the garden."</p>

<p>When they had walked a short distance from the guards, Tarzan
paused and faced his visitor. "What is it?" he asked. "You have
brought me bad news?"</p>

<p>"Very bad," replied Phobeg. "Gemnon, Thudos, and many of their
friends have been arrested and are now in the dungeons. Doria has
been taken and is imprisoned in the temple. I did not expect to
find you at liberty, but took the chance that Nemone's interest in
you might have saved you temporarily. If you can escape from
Cathne, do so at once. Her mood may change at any moment; she is as
mad as a monkey."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Phobeg," said the ape-man. "Now get back to your
quarters before you become embroiled in this affair."</p>

<p>"And you will escape?" asked the warrior.</p>

<p>"I owe something to Gemnon," replied Tarzan, "for his kindness
and his friendship, so I shall not go until I have done what I can
to help him."</p>

<p>"No one can help him," stated Phobeg emphatically.</p>

<p>"All that you will do is get yourself in trouble."</p>

<p>"I shall have to chance it, and now good-bye, my friend; but
before you go tell me where Doria is imprisoned."</p>

<p>"On the third floor of the temple at the rear of the building,
just above the doorway where I awaited you this evening."</p>

<p>Tarzan accompanied Phobeg to the gate and out into the avenue.
"Where are you going?" demanded the latter.</p>

<p>"To the palace."</p>

<p>"You, too, are mad," protested Phobeg, but already the ape-man
had left him and was walking rapidly along the avenue in the
direction of the palace.</p>

<p>It was late, but Tarzan was now a familiar figure to the palace
guards, and when he told them that Nemone had summoned him they let
him enter, nor was he stopped until he had reached the anteroom
outside the queen's apartments. Here a noble on guard protested
that the hour was late and that the queen had retired, but Tarzan
insisted upon seeing her.</p>

<p>"Tell her it is Tarzan," he said.</p>

<p>"I do not dare disturb her," explained the noble nervously.</p>

<p>"I dare," said Tarzan and stepped to the door leading to the
ivory room where Nemone had been accustomed to receive him. The
noble sought to interfere but the ape-man pushed him aside and
attempted to open the door, only to find it securely bolted upon
the opposite side. Then with his clenched fist he pounded loudly
upon its carved surface.</p>

<p>Instantly from beyond it came the savage growls of Belthar and a
moment later the frightened voice of a woman. "Who is there?" she
demanded. "The queen sleeps. Who dares disturb her?"</p>

<p>"Go and awaken her," shouted Tarzan through the door. "Tell her
that Tarzan is here and wishes to see her at once."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," replied the girl. "The queen will be angry. Go
away, and come in the morning."</p>

<p>Then Tarzan heard another voice beyond the door demanding, "Who
is it comes pounding on Nemone's door at such an hour?" and
recognized it as the queen's.</p>

<p>"It is the noble Tarzan," replied the slave girl.</p>

<p>"Draw the bolts and admit him," commanded Nemone, and as the
door swung open Tarzan stepped into the ivory room.</p>

<p>The queen stood halfway across the apartment, facing him. She
directed the slave to re-bolt the door and leave the apartment;
then she turned and, walking to the couch, motioned Tarzan to
approach. As she sank among the soft cushions she motioned Tarzan
to her side.</p>

<p>"I am glad you came," she said. "I could not sleep. I have been
thinking of you. But tell me, why did you come? Had you been
thinking of me?"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of you, Nemone," replied the ape-man. "I
have been thinking that perhaps you will help me; that you can help
me, I know."</p>

<p>"You have only to ask," replied the queen softly.</p>

<p>"There is no favor that you may not have from Nemone for the
asking."</p>

<p>A single cresset shed a soft, flickering light that scarcely
dispelled the darkness of the room, at the far end of which the
yellow-green eyes of Belthar blazed like twin lamps.</p>

<p>Then that same fatal door at the far end of the apartment opened
and the tapping of a metal-shod staff upon the stone floor brought
them both erect to gaze into the snarling face of M'duze.</p>

<p>"You fool!" cried the old hag in a shrill falsetto. "Send the
man away, unless you would see him killed here before your eyes!
Send him away at once!"</p>

<p>Nemone sprang to her feet and faced the old woman who was now
trembling with rage.</p>

<p>"You have gone too far, M'duze," she said in a cold and level
voice. "Remember that I am queen."</p>

<p>She glided quickly toward the old woman, and as she passed a low
stand she stooped and seized something that lay there. Suddenly the
slave woman shrieked and shrank away, but before she could turn and
flee Nemone was upon her and seized her by the hair.</p>

<p>"Always you have ruined my life," cried Nemone, "you and Tomos.
You have robbed me of happiness, and for that, this!" and she drove
the gleaming blade of a knife into the withered breast of the
screaming woman.</p>

<p>Presently M'duze ceased shrieking and sank to the floor. Someone
was pounding upon the door to the anteroom and the terrified voices
of nobles and guardsmen could be heard demanding entrance. In his
corner Belthar tugged at his chains and roared. Nemone stood
looking down upon M'duze with blazing eyes and snarling lips. Then
she turned slowly towards the door upon which the pounding of her
retainers' fists resounded. "Have done!" she called imperiously.
"I, Nemone the queen, am safe."</p>

<p>The voices beyond the door died away as the guardsmen returned
to their posts; then Nemone faced Tarzan. She looked suddenly worn
and very tired. "That favor," she said, "ask it another time.
Nemone is unstrung."</p>

<p>"I must ask it now," replied Tarzan; "tomorrow may be too
late."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "I am listening. What is it?"</p>

<p>"There is a noble in your court who has been very kind to me
since I have been in Cathne," commenced Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Now he is in trouble, and I have come to ask you to save
him."</p>

<p>Nemone's brow clouded. "Who is he?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Gemnon," replied the ape-man. "He has been arrested with Thudos
and the daughter of Thudos and several of their friends. It is only
a plot to destroy me."</p>

<p>"You dare come to me to intercede for traitors!" cried the
queen, blazing with sudden fury. "But I know the reason; you love
Doria!"</p>

<p>"I do not love her. I have seen her but once. Gemnon loves her.
Let them be happy, Nemone."</p>

<p>"I am not happy," she replied; "why should they be happy?"</p>

<p>She turned away and buried her face in her arms as she sank to
the couch; he saw her shoulders shaken by sobs, and pity filled his
heart. He drew nearer to console her, but he had no chance to speak
before she wheeled upon him, her eyes flashing through tears. "The
girl, Doria, dies!" she cried. "Xarator shall have her tomorrow!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; FLAMING XARATOR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">HER wrists and ankles bound, Doria, the daughter
of Thudos, lay on a pile of skins in a room upon the third floor of
the temple of Thoos. Diffused moonlight entered the single window,
relieving the darkness of the interior of her prison. She had seen
her father seized and dragged away; she was in the power of one so
ruthless that she knew she could expect no mercy and that either
death or cruel disfigurement awaited her, yet she did not weep.</p>

<p>Above her grief rose the pride of the noble blood of the house
of Thudos, the courage of a line of warriors that stretched back
into the forgotten ages; and she was brave.</p>

<p>She thought of Gemnon, and then the tears almost came, not for
herself but for him, because of the grief that would be his when he
learned of her fate. She did not know that he, too, had fallen into
the clutches of the enemies of her father.</p>

<p>Presently she heard the sound of footsteps approaching along the
corridor, heard them stop before the door behind which she was
locked. The door swung open and the room was illuminated by the
light of a torch held in the hand of a man who entered and closed
the door behind him.</p>

<p>The girl lying upon the pile of skins recognized Erot. She saw
him place the blazing torch in a wall socket designed for the
purpose and turn toward her.</p>

<p>"Ah, the lovely Doria!" he exclaimed. "What ill fate has brought
you here?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless the noble Erot could answer that question better than
I," she replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe that he could; in fact, I know it. It was I who
caused you to be brought here; it was I who caused your father to
be imprisoned; it was I who sent Gemnon to the same cell with the
noble Thudos."</p>

<p>"Gemnon imprisoned!" cried the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, with many other conspirators against the throne. Behind
his back they used to sneer at Erot because he was not a lion man.
They will not sneer for long."</p>

<p>"And what is to be done with me?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Nemone has decreed Xarator for you," replied Erot. "You are
even now lying upon the skins in which you are to be sewn. It is
for that purpose that I am here. My good friend Tomos the councilor
sent me to sew you into the bag."</p>

<p>At that moment, a low growl sounded from the direction of the
window. Erot looked up, and his face went ashy white. He leaped
back and fled toward the door upon the opposite side of the room,
his craven heart pounding in terror.</p>

<p><br>
It was early in the morning as the procession formed that was to
accompany the doomed Doria to Xarator, for Xarator lies sixteen
miles from the city of Cathne in the mountains at the far end of
the valley of Onthar, and the procession could move no faster than
the lions drawing the chariot of the queen would walk, which was
not fast.</p>

<p>Bred for generations for this purpose, the lions of Cathne had
far greater endurance than forest bred lions, yet it would be well
into the night before it could be hoped to make the long journey to
Xarator and return. Hundreds of slaves bore torches with which to
light the homeward journey after night had fallen.</p>

<p>Nemone entered her chariot. She was wrapped in woolen robes and
the skins of animals, for the morning air was still chill. At her
side walked Tomos, nervous and ill at ease. He knew that M'duze was
dead and wondered if he would be next. The queen's manner was curt
and abrupt, filling him with dread, for now there was no M'duze to
protect him from the easily aroused wrath of Nemone.</p>

<p>"Where is Tarzan?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I do not know, majesty," replied Tomos. "I have not seen
him."</p>

<p>"Produce him," commanded Nemone sullenly. "It grows late, and
Nemone is not accustomed to wait upon any."</p>

<p>"But, majesty&mdash;" began Tomos again.</p>

<p>"Here he comes now!" exclaimed Nemone as Tarzan strode up the
avenue toward her.</p>

<p>Tomos breathed a sigh of relief and wiped the perspiration from
his forehead. He did not like Tarzan, but in all his life he had
never before been so glad to see anyone alive and well.</p>

<p>"You are late," said Nemone as Tarzan stopped beside her
chariot.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Jungle made no reply.</p>

<p>"We are not accustomed to being delayed," she continued a little
sharply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you placed me in the custody of Erot, as I
suggested, he would deliver me on time in future."</p>

<p>Nemone ignored this and turned to Tomos. "We are ready," she
said.</p>

<p>At a word from the councilor a trumpeter at his side raised his
instrument to his lips and sounded a call. Slowly the long
procession began to move, and like a huge serpent crawled toward
the bridge of gold. The citizens lining the avenue moved with it,
men, women, and children. The women and children carried packages
in which food was wrapped, the men bore arms. A journey to Xarator
was an event. It took them the length of Onthar where wild lions
roamed and where Athnean raiders might set upon them at any moment
of the day or night, especially of the night, so the march took on
something of the aspects of both a pageant and a military
excursion.</p>

<p>Behind the golden chariot of the queen rolled a second chariot
on the floor of which lay a bundle sewn in the skins of lions.
Chained to this chariot were Thudos and Gemnon. Following were a
hundred chariots driven by nobles in gold and ivory, while other
nobles on foot entirely surrounded the chariot of the queen.</p>

<p>There were columns of marching warriors in the lead, and in the
rear were the war lions of Cathne, the royal fighting lions of the
queen. Keepers held them on leashes of gold, and proud nobles of
ancient families marched beside them&mdash;the lion men of
Cathne.</p>

<p>The barbaric splendor of the scene impressed even the ape-man
who cared little for display, though he gave no outward sign of
interest as he strode at the wheel of Nemone's chariot drawn by its
eight great lions held in leash by twenty four powerful slaves in
tunics of red and gold.</p>

<p>The sun, climbing into the heavens, was bringing heat. Slaves
carrying an umbrella over the queen adjusted it to fend the hot
rays from her; others waved lions' tails attached to the ends of
long poles to and fro about her to drive the insects away. A gentle
breeze carried the dust of the long column lazily toward the
west.</p>

<p>Nemone sighed and turned to Tarzan. "Why were you late?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Would it be strange that I overslept?" he asked. "It was late
when I left the palace, and there was no keeper to awaken me since
you took Gemnon away."</p>

<p>"Had you wished to see me again as badly as I wished to see you,
you would not have been late."</p>

<p>"I was as anxious to be here as you," he replied.</p>

<p>"You have never seen Xarator?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It is a holy mountain, created by Thoos for the enemies of the
kings and queens of Cathne. In all the world there is nothing like
it."</p>

<p>"I am going to enjoy seeing it," replied the ape-man grimly.</p>

<p>They were approaching a fork in the road. "That road leading to
the right runs through the Pass of the Warriors into the valley of
Thenar," she explained. "Some day I shall send you on a raid to
Thenar, and you shall bring me Athne's greatest warriors as
hostages."</p>

<p>Tarzan thought of Valthor and wondered if he had reached Athne
in safety. He glanced back at Thudos and Gemnon. He had not spoken
to them, but it was because of them that he was here. He might
easily have escaped had he not determined to remain until he was
certain that he could not aid these friends. Their case appeared
hopeless, yet the ape-man had not given up hope.</p>

<p>At noon the procession stopped for lunch. The populace scattered
about seeking the shade of the trees that dotted the plain and that
had not already been selected by the queen and the nobles. The
lions were led into shade, where they lay down to rest. Warriors,
always on the lookout for danger, stood guard about the temporary
encampment.</p>

<p>There was always danger on the Field of the Lions.</p>

<p>The halt was brief; in half an hour the cavalcade was on the
march again. There was less talking now; silence and the great heat
hung over the dusty column. The hills that bounded the valley upon
the north were close, and soon they entered them, following a
canyon upward to a winding mountain road that led into the hills
above.</p>

<p>Presently the smell of sulfur fumes came plainly to the nostrils
of the ape-man, and a little later the column turned the shoulder
of a great mass of volcanic rock and came upon the edge of a huge
crater. Far below, molten rock bubbled, sending up spurts of flame,
geysers of steam, and columns of yellow smoke. The scene was
impressive and awe-inspiring. Tarzan stood with folded arms and
bent head gazing down into the seething inferno until the queen
touched him on the shoulder. "What do you think of Xarator?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "There are some emotions," he answered
slowly, "for which no words have yet been coined."</p>

<p>"It was created by Thoos for the kings of Cathne," she explained
proudly.</p>

<p>Tarzan made no reply; perhaps he was thinking that here again
the lexicographers had failed to furnish words adequate to the
occasion.</p>

<p>On either side of the royal party the people crowded close to
the edge of the crater that they might miss nothing of what was
about to transpire. The children laughed and played, or teased
their mothers for the food that was being saved for the evening
meal upon the return journey to Cathne.</p>

<p>The ceremony at Xarator, though it bore the authority of
so-called justice, was of a semi-religious nature that required the
presence and active participation of priests, two of whom lifted
the sack containing the victim from the chariot and placed it at
the edge of the crater at the feet of the queen.</p>

<p>As two other priests lifted the body from the ground and were
about to hurl it into the crater, she stopped them with a curt
command. "Wait!" she cried. "We would look upon the too great
beauty of Doria, the daughter of Thudos, the traitor."</p>

<p>All eyes were upon the priest who drew his dagger and ripped
open the bag along one loosely sewn seam. The eyes of Thudos and
Gemnon were fixed upon the still figure outlined beneath the tawny
skins of lions. Beads of perspiration stood upon their foreheads;
their jaws and their fists were clenched. The eyes of Tarzan turned
from the activities of the priest to the face of the queen; between
narrowed lids, from beneath stern brows they watched her.</p>

<p>The priests, gathering the bag by one side, raised it and let
the body roll out upon the ground where all could see it. There was
a gasp of astonishment. Nemone cried out in a sudden fit of rage.
The body was that of Erot, and he was dead!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; THE QUEEN'S
QUARRY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER the first involuntary cries of surprise and
rage, an ominous silence fell upon the barbaric scene. Now all eyes
were centered upon the queen, whose ordinarily beautiful
countenance was almost hideous from rage, a rage which, after her
single angry cry, choked further utterance for the moment. But at
length she found her voice and turned furiously upon Tomos.</p>

<p>"What means this?" she demanded, her voice now controlled and as
cold as the steel in the sheath at her side.</p>

<p>Tomos, who was as much astounded as she, stammered as he
trembled in his sandals of elephant hide. "There are traitors even
in the temple of Thoos!" he cried. "I chose Erot to prepare the
girl for the embraces of Xarator because I knew that his loyalty to
his queen would ensure the work being well done. I did not know, O
gracious Nemone, that this vile crime had been committed or that
the body of Erot had been substituted for that of the daughter of
Thudos until this very instant."</p>

<p>With an expression of disgust the queen commanded the priests to
hurl the body of Erot into the crater, and, as it was swallowed by
the fiery pit, she ordered an immediate return to Cathne.</p>

<p>In morose and gloomy silence she rode down the winding mountain
trail and out onto the Field of the Lions, and often her eyes were
upon the bronzed giant striding beside her chariot.</p>

<p>At last she broke her silence. "Two of your enemies are gone
now," she said. "I destroyed one; who do you think destroyed the
other?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did," suggested Tarzan with a smile.</p>

<p>"I had been thinking of that possibility," replied Nemone, but
she did not smile.</p>

<p>"Whoever did it performed a service for Cathne."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she half agreed, "but it is not the killing of Erot
that annoys me. It is the effrontery that dared interfere with the
plans of Nemone."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged his broad shoulders, but remained silent.</p>

<p>The tedious journey back to Cathne ended at last, and with
flaring torches lighting the way, the queen's procession crossed
the bridge of gold and entered the city. Here she immediately
ordered a thorough search to be made for Doria.</p>

<p>Thudos and Gemnon, happy but mystified, were returned to their
cell to await the new doom that Nemone would fix for them. Tarzan
was commanded to accompany Nemone into the palace and dine with
her. Tomos had been dismissed with a curt injunction to find Doria
or prepare for the worst.</p>

<p>Tarzan and the queen ate alone in a small dining room attended
only by slaves, and when the meal was over Nemone conducted him to
the now all too familiar ivory room, where he was greeted by the
angry growls of Belthar.</p>

<p>"Erot and M'duze are dead," said the queen, "and I have sent
Tomos away. There will be none to disturb us tonight."</p>

<p>The ape-man sat with his eyes fixed upon her, studying her. It
seemed incredible that this sweet and lovely woman could be the
cruel tyrant that was Nemone the queen.</p>

<p>But then, as the Lord of the Jungle looked at her, the spell
that had held him vanished. Beneath the beautiful exterior he saw
the crazed mind of a mad woman. He saw the creature that cast
defenseless men to wild beasts, that disfigured or destroyed women
who might be more beautiful than she, and all that was fine in him
revolted.</p>

<p>With a half growl he arose to his feet. Nemone gazed for a
moment questioningly at the man above her; then she seemed to
realize what he was thinking, and the mad, cruel light of rage
blazed in her eyes. She sprang to one side of the room where a
metal gong depended from the ceiling and seizing the striker smote
it three times.</p>

<p>The brazen notes rang through the chamber mingling with the
roars of the infuriated lion Belthar.</p>

<p>Tarzan stood watching her; she seemed wholly irresponsible,
quite mad. It would be useless to attempt to reason with her. He
moved slowly toward the door, but before he reached it, it swung
open, and a score of warriors accompanied by two nobles rushed
in.</p>

<p>"Take this man!" ordered Nemone. "Throw him into the cell with
the other enemies of the queen!"</p>

<p>Tarzan was unarmed. He had worn only a sword when he entered the
ivory room and that he had unbuckled and laid upon a stand near the
doorway. There were twenty spears leveled at him, twenty spears
that entirely encircled him. With a shrug he surrendered. It was
that or death. In prison he might find the means to escape; at
least he would see Gemnon again, and there was something that he
very much wished to tell Gemnon and Thudos.</p>

<p>As the soldiers conducted him from the room and the door closed
behind them, Nemone threw herself among the cushions of her couch,
her body racked by choking sobs. The great lion grumbled in the
dusky corner of the room. Suddenly Nemone sat erect and her eyes
blazed into the blazing eyes of the lion. For a moment she sat
there thus, and then she arose and a peal of maniacal laughter
broke from her lips.</p>

<p><br>
Thudos and Gemnon sitting in their cell heard the tramp of marching
men approaching the prison in which they were confined. "Evidently
Nemone cannot wait until tomorrow," said Thudos.</p>

<p>"You think she is sending for us now?" asked Gemnon.</p>

<p>"What else?" demanded the older man. "The lion pit can be
illuminated."</p>

<p>As they waited and listened, the steps stopped outside their
cell, the door was pushed open, and a man entered. The warriors had
carried no torches and neither Thudos nor Gemnon could discern the
features of the newcomer. None of them spoke until the guard had
departed out of earshot. "Greetings, Thudos and Gemnon!" exclaimed
the new prisoner cheerily.</p>

<p>"Tarzan!" exclaimed Gemnon.</p>

<p>"None other," admitted the ape-man.</p>

<p>"What brings you here?" demanded Thudos.</p>

<p>"Twenty warriors and the whim of a woman, an insane woman,"
replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"So you have fallen from favor!" exclaimed Gemnon. "I am
sorry."</p>

<p>"It was inevitable," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And what will your punishment be?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, but I suspect that it will be quite sufficient.
However, that is something that need not concern any of us until it
happens. Maybe it won't happen at all."</p>

<p>"There is no room in the dungeon of Nemone for optimism,"
remarked Thudos with a grim laugh.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," agreed the ape-man, "but I shall continue to
indulge myself. Doubtless Doria felt hopeless in her prison in the
temple last night, yet she escaped Xarator."</p>

<p>"That is a miracle that I cannot fathom," said Gemnon.</p>

<p>"It was quite simple," Tarzan assured him. "A loyal friend,
whose identity you may guess, came and told me that she was a
prisoner in the temple. I went at once to find her. Fortunately the
trees of Cathne are old and large and numerous; one of them grows
close to the rear of the temple, its branches almost brushing the
window of the room in which Doria was confined. When I arrived
there, I found Erot there with Doria. I also found the sack in
which he had purposed tying her for the journey to Xarator. What
was simpler? I let Erot take the ride that had been planned for
Doria."</p>

<p>"You saved her! Where is she?" cried Thudos, his voice breaking
in the first emotion he had displayed since he had learned of his
daughter's plight.</p>

<p>"Come close," cautioned Tarzan, "lest the walls themselves be
enemies." The two men pressed close to the speaker who continued in
a low whisper, "Do you recall, Gemnon, that when we were at the
gold mine I spoke aside to one of the slaves there?"</p>

<p>"I believe that I did notice it," replied Gemnon. "I thought you
were asking questions about the operation of the mine."</p>

<p>"No; I was delivering a message from his brother, and so
grateful was he that he begged that he be permitted to serve me if
the opportunity arose. It was to arise much sooner than either of
us could have expected; and so, when it was necessary to find a
hiding place for Doria, I thought immediately of the isolated hut
of Niaka, the headman of the black slaves at the gold mine.</p>

<p>"She is there now, and the man will protect her as long as is
necessary. He has promised me that if he hears nothing from me for
half a moon he is to understand that none of us three can come to
her aid, and that then he will get word to the faithful slaves of
the house of Thudos. He says that that will be difficult but not
impossible."</p>

<p>"Doria safe!" whispered Gemnon. "Thudos and I may now die
happy."</p>

<p>For some time the three men sat in silence that was broken at
last by Gemnon. "How did it happen that you knew the brother of a
slave well enough to carry a message from one to the other?" he
asked, a note of puzzlement in his voice.</p>

<p>"Do you recall Xerstle's grand hunt?" asked Tarzan with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Of course, but what has that to do with it?" demanded
Gemnon.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the quarry, the man we saw on the slave block
in the market place?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He is the brother of Niaka," explained Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But you never had an opportunity to speak to him," objected the
young noble.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I did. It was I who helped him escape. That was why his
brother was so grateful to me."</p>

<p>"I still do not understand," said Gemnon.</p>

<p>"There is probably much connected with Xerstle's grand hunt that
you do not understand," suggested Tarzan. And he went on to tell
his part in the hunt.</p>

<p>"Now I am doubly sorry that I must die," said Gemnon.</p>

<p>"Why more so than before?" asked Thudos.</p>

<p>"I shall never have the opportunity to tell the story of
Xerstle's grand hunt," he explained. "What a story that would
make!"</p>

<p><br>
The morning dawned bright and beautiful, just as though there was
no misery or sorrow or cruelty in the world, but it did not change
matters at all, other than to make the cell in which the three men
were confined uncomfortably warm as the day progressed.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon a guard came and took Tarzan away. All three
of the prisoners were acquainted with the officer who commanded it,
a decent fellow who spoke sympathetically to them. "Is he coming
back?" asked Thudos, nodding toward Tarzan.</p>

<p>The officer shook his head. "No. The queen hunts today."</p>

<p>Thudos and Gemnon pressed the ape-man's shoulder.</p>

<p>No word was spoken, but that wordless farewell was more eloquent
than words. They saw him go out, saw the door close behind him, but
neither spoke, and so they sat for a long hour in silence.</p>

<p>In the guardroom, to which he had been conducted from his cell,
Tarzan was heavily chained. A golden collar was placed about his
neck, and a chain reaching from each side of it was held in the
hands of a warrior.</p>

<p>"Why all the precautions?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"It is merely a custom," explained the officer. "It is always
thus that the queen's quarry is led to the Field of the Lions."</p>

<p>Once again Tarzan of the Apes walked near the chariot of the
queen of Cathne, but this time he walked behind it, a chained
prisoner between two stalwart warriors and surrounded by a score of
others. Once again he crossed the bridge of gold out onto the Field
of the Lions in the valley of Onthar.</p>

<p>The procession did not go far, scarcely more than a mile from
the city. With scowling brows Nemone sat brooding in her chariot as
it stopped at last at the point she had selected for the start of
the hunt. She ordered the guard to fetch the prisoner to her. She
was looking straight ahead as the ape-man halted by the wheel of
her chariot.</p>

<p>"Send all away except the two warriors who hold him," commanded
Nemone.</p>

<p>"You may send them, too, if you wish," said Tarzan. "I give you
my word not to harm you or try to escape while they are away."</p>

<p>Nemone, still looking straight ahead, was silent for a moment;
then, "You may all go. I would speak with the prisoner alone."</p>

<p>When the guard had departed a number of paces, the queen turned
her eyes toward Tarzan and found his smiling into her own. "You are
going to be very happy, Nemone," he said in an easy, friendly
voice.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked. "How am I going to be happy?"</p>

<p>"You are going to see me die, that is if the lion catches me,"
he laughed.</p>

<p>"You think that will give me pleasure? Well, I thought so
myself, but now I am wondering if it will. Nothing in life is ever
what I hope for."</p>

<p>"Possibly you don't hope for the right things," he suggested.
"Did you ever try hoping for something that would bring pleasure
and happiness to someone beside yourself?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?" she asked. "I hope for my own happiness; let
others do the same. I strive for my own happiness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And never have any," interrupted the ape-man
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Probably I should have less if I strove only for the happiness
of others," she insisted.</p>

<p>"There are people like that," he assented. "Perhaps you are one
of them, so you might as well go on striving for happiness in your
own way. Of course you won't get it, but you will at least have the
pleasures of anticipation, and that is something."</p>

<p>"I think I know myself and my own affairs well enough to
determine for myself how to conduct my life," she said with a note
of asperity in her voice.</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "It was not in my thoughts to interfere," he
said. "If you are determined to kill me and are quite sure that you
will derive pleasure from it, why, I should be the last in the
world to suggest that you abandon the idea."</p>

<p>"You do not amuse me," said Nemone haughtily. "I do not care for
irony that is aimed at myself." She turned fiercely on him. "Men
have died for less!" she cried, and the Lord of the Jungle laughed
in her face.</p>

<p>"How many times?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A moment ago," said Nemone, "I was beginning to regret the
thing that is about to happen. Had you been different, I might have
relented and returned you to favor, but you do everything to
antagonize me. You affront me, you insult me, you laugh at me." Her
voice was rising, a barometric indication, Tarzan had learned, of
her mental state.</p>

<p>"You will go on killing people and being unhappy until it is
your turn to be killed," Tarzan said.</p>

<p>She shuddered. "Killed!" she repeated. "Yes, they are all
killed, the kings and queens of Cathne. But it is not my turn yet.
While Belthar lives, Nemone lives."</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. "You may live, too, Tarzan, if you
kneel here, before my people, and beg for mercy."</p>

<p>"Bring on your lion," said Tarzan. "His mercy might be kinder
than Nemone's."</p>

<p>"You refuse?" she demanded angrily.</p>

<p>"You would kill me eventually," he replied. "There is a chance
the lion may not be able to."</p>

<p>"Not a chance!" she said. "Have you seen the lion?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Nemone turned and called a noble. "Have the hunting lion brought
to scent the quarry!"</p>

<p>Behind them there was a scattering of troops and nobles as they
made an avenue for the hunting lion and his keepers, and along the
avenue Tarzan saw a great lion straining at the golden leashes to
which eight men clung. Growling and roaring, the beast sprang from
side to side in an effort to seize a keeper or lay hold upon one of
the warriors or nobles that lined the way; so that it was all that
four stalwart men on either side of him could do to prevent his
accomplishing his design.</p>

<p>He was still afar when Tarzan saw the tuft of white hair in the
center of his mane between his ears. It was Belthar!</p>

<p>Nemone was eying the man at her side as a cat might eye a mouse,
but though the lion was close now she saw no change in the
expression on Tarzan's face. "Do you not recognize him?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," he replied.</p>

<p>"And you are not afraid?"</p>

<p>"Of what?" he asked, looking at her wonderingly.</p>

<p>She stamped her foot in anger, thinking that he was trying to
rob her of the satisfaction of witnessing his terror, for how could
she know that Tarzan of the Apes could not understand the meaning
of fear? "Prepare for the grand hunt!" she commanded, turning to a
noble standing with the guard.</p>

<p>The warriors who had held Tarzan in leash ran forward and picked
up the golden chains that were attached to the golden collar about
his neck, the guards took posts about the chariot of the queen, and
Tarzan was led a few yards in advance of it. Then the keepers
brought Belthar closer to him, holding him just out of reach but
only with difficulty, for when the irascible beast recognized the
ape-man he flew into a frenzy of rage that taxed the eight men to
hold him at all.</p>

<p>A noble approached Tarzan. He was Phordos, the father of Gemnon,
hereditary captain of the hunt for the rulers of Cathne. He came
quite close to Tarzan and spoke to him in a low whisper. "I am
sorry that I must have a part in this," he said, "but my office
requires it." And then aloud, "In the name of the queen, silence!
These are the rules of the grand hunt of Nemone, queen of Cathne:
the quarry shall move north down the center of the lane of
warriors; when he has proceeded a hundred paces the keepers shall
unleash the hunting lion, Belthar. Let no man distract the lion
from the chase or aid the quarry, under penalty of death."</p>

<p>"What if I elude him and escape?" demanded the ape-man. "Shall I
have my freedom then?"</p>

<p>Phordos shook his head sadly. "You will not escape him," he
said. Then he turned toward the queen and knelt. "All is in
readiness, your majesty. Shall the hunt commence?"</p>

<p>"Let the lion scent the quarry once more; then the hunt may
start," she directed.</p>

<p>The keepers let Belthar move a little closer to the ape-man.</p>

<p>Nemone leaned forward eagerly, staring at the savage beast that
was the pride of her stable; the light of insanity gleamed in her
eyes now. "It is enough!" she cried.</p>

<p><br>
In a hollow near the river that runs past Cathne a lion lay asleep
in dense brush, a mighty beast with a yellow coat and a great black
mane. Strange sounds coming to him from the plain disturbed him and
he rumbled complainingly in his throat, but as yet he seemed only
half awake.</p>

<p>His eyes were closed, but his half-wakefulness was only seeming.
Numa was awake, but he wanted to sleep and was angry with the
men-things that were disturbing him. They were not too close as
yet, but he knew that if they came closer he would have to get up
and investigate, and that he did not want to do. He felt very
lazy.</p>

<p><br>
Out on the field Tarzan was striding along the spear bound lane. He
counted his steps, knowing that at the hundredth Belthar would be
loosed upon him. The ape-man had a plan. Across the river to the
east was the forest in which he had hunted with Xerstle and Pindes
and Gemnon; could he reach it, he would be safe. No lion or no man
could hope ever to overtake the Lord of the Jungle once he swung to
the branches of those towering old trees.</p>

<p>But could he reach the wood before Belthar overtook him? Tarzan
was swift, but there are few creatures as swift as Numa at the
height of his charge. With a start of a hundred paces, the ape-man
felt that he might outdistance an ordinary lion, but Belthar was no
ordinary lion.</p>

<p>At the hundredth pace Tarzan leaped forward at top speed. Behind
him he heard the frenzied roar of the hunting lion as his leashes
were slipped and, mingling with it, the roar of the crowd.</p>

<p>Smoothly and low ran Belthar, the hunting lion, swiftly closing
up the distance that separated him from the quarry. He looked
neither to right nor to left; his fierce, blazing eyes remained
fixed upon the fleeing man ahead.</p>

<p>Belthar was gaining on the quarry when Tarzan turned suddenly to
the east toward the river after he had passed the end of the
gauntlet that had held him to a straight path at the beginning of
his flight.</p>

<p>A scream of rage burst from the lips of Nemone as she saw and
realized the purpose of the quarry. A sullen roar rose from the
pursuing crowd. They had not thought that the hunted man had a
chance, but now they understood that he might yet reach the river
and the forest.</p>

<p>Tarzan, glancing back over a bronzed shoulder, realized that the
end was near. The river was still two hundred yards away and the
lion, steadily gaining on him, but fifty.</p>

<p>Then the ape-man turned and waited. He stood at ease, his arms
hanging at his side, but he was alert and ready.</p>

<p>He knew precisely what Belthar would do, and he knew what he
would do. No amount of training would have changed the lion's
instinctive method of attack. He would rush at Tarzan, rear upon
his hind feet when close, seize him with his taloned paws and drive
his great fangs through his head or neck or shoulder. Then he would
drag him down.</p>

<p>But Tarzan had met the charge of lions before. It would not be
quite as easy for Belthar as Belthar and the screaming audience
believed, yet the ape-man guessed that, without a knife, he could
do no more than delay the inevitable. He would die fighting,
however, and now, as Belthar charged growling upon him, he crouched
slightly and answered the roaring challenge of the carnivore with a
roar as savage as the lion's.</p>

<p>Suddenly he detected a new note in the voice of the crowd, a
note of surprise and consternation. Belthar was almost upon him as
a tawny body streaked past the ape-man, brushing his leg as it came
from behind him, and, as Belthar rose upon his hind feet, fell upon
him, a fury of talons and gleaming fangs, a great lion with a
golden coat and a black mane&mdash;a mighty engine of rage and
destruction.</p>

<p>Roaring and growling, the two great beasts rolled upon the
ground as they tore at one another with teeth and claws while the
astounded ape-man looked on and the chariot of the queen
approached, and the breathless crowd pressed forward.</p>

<p>The strange lion was larger than Belthar and more powerful, a
giant of a lion in the full prime of his strength and ferocity.
Presently Belthar gave him an opening, and his great jaws closed
upon the throat of the hunting lion of Nemone, jaws that drove
mighty fangs through the thick mane of his adversary, through hide
and flesh deep into the jugular of Belthar. Then he braced his feet
and shook Belthar as a cat might shake a mouse.</p>

<p>Dropping Belthar to the ground, the victor faced the astonished
Cathneans with snarling face. Then he slowly backed to where the
ape-man stood and stopped beside him and Tarzan laid his hand upon
the black mane of Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion.</p>

<p>For a long moment there was unbroken silence as the two faced
the enemies of the Lord of the Jungle, and the awed Cathneans only
stood and stared; then a woman's voice rose in a weird scream. It
was Nemone. Slowly she stepped from her golden car and amidst utter
silence walked toward the dead Belthar while her people watched
her, motionless and wondering.</p>

<p>She stopped with her sandaled feet touching the bloody mane of
the hunting lion and gazed down upon the dead carnivore.</p>

<p>"Belthar is dead!" she screamed, and whipping her dagger from
its sheath drove its glittering point deep into her own heart.</p>

<p><br>
As the moon rose, Tarzan placed a final rock upon a mound of earth
beside the river that runs to Cathne through the valley of
Onthar.</p>

<p>The warriors and the nobles and the people had followed Phordos
to the city to empty the dungeons of Nemone and proclaim Alextar
king, leaving their dead queen lying at the edge of the Field of
the Lions with the dead Belthar.</p>

<p>The human service they had neglected, the beast-man had
performed, and now beneath the soft radiance of an African moon he
stood with bowed head beside the grave of a woman who had found
happiness at last.</p>
