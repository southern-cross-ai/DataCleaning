  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER 1</a><br>
  "There is no such person. There is no such country."</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was typical south-west monsoon weather, about as bad as
  Noah's deluge. Due to choked drains and innumerable other troubles, some
  parts of the single track lay two feet under water; and it was next thing to
  impossible to see through the driving rain, so the "up mixed" reached the
  terminus three hours late. It crawled dejectedly and grumbled to a standstill
  in Narada Station, with curtains of water drooling from its eaves. The drum
  of the rain on the iron station roof seemed to add to the gloom of the
  lamp-lit platform. Stanley Copeland stuck his head out through a first-class
  compartment window and received not less than a gallon of water on the back
  of his neck. Cursing all things Indian, he opened the door then and jumped
  for comparative shelter&mdash;simultaneously with a very obese Bengali babu,*
  who was traveling second and apparently possessed no other luggage than a
  black umbrella.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>babu, baboo</i> (Hindi)&mdash;gentleman; used as a
  Hindi courtesy title; equivalent to English "Mr"; also: a Hindu clerk who is
  literate in English; also, when used derogatively: a native of India who has
  acquired some superficial education in English. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/47/B0004700.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. For more detail see the entry <a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:96.hobson">Baboo</a>
  in <i>The Hobson Jobson Dictionary</i>. ]</p>

  <p>"What chance of getting a porter?" he asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"None whatever, sahib. Haven't you a servant?"</p>

  <p>Copeland had not, but he had a smile worth money. He had to pitch his
  voice against the splash of torrents from the eaves, the crash of thunder and
  the scream of the engine's safety valve; but his voice was sonorous, not
  harsh:</p>

  <p>"Someone was to have met me, but apparently he hasn't. If they tried to
  auction India&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The babu interrupted him. He chuckled amiably, pointing to the railway
  dining-room.</p>

  <p>"You go in there and order dinner for us both," he said, "and whisky pegs
  in two tall glasses; those are most important. Do you see those
  elephants?"</p>

  <p>Three huge brutes loomed and swayed in lamplit shadow on the far side of
  the platform. One had an awninged, nickel-plated howdah, dyed tusks and
  vermilion paint around its eyes.</p>

  <p>"There is a royal personage on this train," said the babu. "He monopolizes
  all the porters. Is your luggage labeled? How many pieces? How many more in
  the compartment? Very well, my servant shall attend to them and I will
  supervise him. I am good at watching other people work. Go in and order
  dinner."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a dish-faced, coppery-hued fellow in a dirty turban and a
  ragged cotton blanket left off talking to a pair of yellow-smocked,
  ascetic-looking pilgrims by the door of a third-class carriage and ran to
  receive the babu's orders. Rather fascinated by the pilgrims, Copeland stared
  at them. To him they seemed more interested in the crowd than most such pious
  people are, when they have sworn a vow of poverty and set forth with staff
  and begging bowl in search of some religious rainbow's end. However, they
  walked away and the shadows swallowed them. Copeland, finding himself alone,
  made tracks for the gloomy dining-room, sat down in the farthest corner at a
  fly-blown tablecloth beside a window, and ordered dinner from a bare-foot
  Goanese who knew enough to bring the drinks first.</p>

  <p>He had to wait for the babu. He had swallowed one drink and ordered
  another when a dark-skinned man in a blue European suit, a raincoat, and a
  turban, entered. He glanced at Copeland shrewdly and then took a seat as far
  away as possible, but sat facing him. He had keen eyes and a look of
  self-assurance, but there was something sinister about him.</p>

  <p>His gestures were those of a conjurer "with nothing to conceal," and his
  very shapely hands were too conspicuous; a ruby, that perhaps was genuine, in
  a ring on the middle finger of his right hand suggested a danger signal; and
  Copeland was not prejudiced in his favor by the fact that he wore a gold
  chain-bracelet on his right wrist. His stare was lynx-like when the babu
  entered. He appeared to suspect, if not to recognize him, but the babu took
  no notice. A cane chair creaked under his weight as he sat down with his back
  towards the other man and swallowed, almost at a draught, the long drink that
  awaited him. Then he plunged into conversation:</p>

  <p>"It will be a rotten dinner, but you will learn that without my telling
  you. What is the use of your talking to me, unless I tell you what you can't
  discover for yourself? I am a reprehensible and graceless babu named
  Chullunder Ghose&mdash;investigator; don't, however, waste your time
  investigating me, for there is no such person. Out there on the platform you
  were about to speak of India. There is no such country."</p>

  <p>"Where, then, have I spent the last six months?" Copeland asked him. "The
  visa on my passport calls it India."</p>

  <p>"If I should call myself a surgeon," said the babu, "would that prove it?
  India speaks more than fifty languages, but can't explain itself. It has a
  hundred heavenly religions, and is going to the devil. It has two hundred
  governments, no two alike, and more misgovernment per square mile than a
  colony of monkeys in a madhouse. India is misunderstood by itself and by
  every one else, the same as you and me, but would like to be understood, the
  same as you would; I, myself, however, pray that nobody may ever understand
  me. If I understood myself, I should inevitably die of boredom. You, sir, are
  a surgeon. Don't deny it. I know all about you."</p>

  <p>"Why should I deny it?" Copeland answered. "There is nothing to know about
  me. I'm a specialist from the neck up&mdash;eye, throat, nose, and ear. Just
  now I'm studying cataract, if you know what that is. I came here because I
  heard that the next State, Kutchdullub, is full of it. I operate on anyone
  who'll let me."</p>

  <p>"So does that man," said the babu with a backward motion of his head, "but
  sane people don't let him."</p>

  <p>Copeland glanced at the man at the far corner table. "Does he know you?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet."'</p>

  <p>"He'll remember the shape of the back of your head!"</p>

  <p>"He shall remember more&mdash;much more!" the babu answered. "If only
  other people had longer memories, he might not now be drawing such a fat
  retainer as the medical wizard in charge of the Prince who came on our train.
  Even wealthy Indian Princes are as silly as peasants and lots of other
  people; they will listen to and pay a charlatan, but send a reputable doctor
  to the devil. Do you find it easy to get patients?"</p>

  <p>Copeland smiled reminiscently. He had merry eyes and almost comically
  large ears, but a studious face and an unself-assertive manner.</p>

  <p>"I've had better luck than I expected," he answered. "Lots of Mohammedan
  patients, and some Hindus. In the hospitals I've had no difficulty with the
  Hindus&mdash;even women. However, if I understand the situation, now I'm up
  against State rights. Narada seems to be the jumping-off place into ancient
  history, as well as railroad terminus and border-town. The Rajah of the next
  State doesn't even answer letters."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, if he were sober &mdash;" said the babu. "Oh, is that the
  trouble? I was told he has religious prejudices against modern medicine and
  surgery."</p>

  <p>"Prejudices!" said the babu. "The religious member of that family is the
  Rajah of Kutchdullub's cousin. It was he who arrived on our train. It is he
  who would inherit if the present Rajah should die childless. The present
  Rajah inherited because his elder brother did die childless. I am an
  investigator. <i>Verb. sap.</i>"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Verbum sapienti sat est</i>&mdash;A word to the
  wise is sufficient. Annotator]</p>

  <p>"I should say, then, that the cousin would be wiser not to cross the
  border. Why does he do it?"</p>

  <p>"And in this weather! There are always seven reasons for everything that
  anybody does. I know three: politics, health, religion. And the greatest of
  these is human nature! That is not a reason, but a good joke. His political
  adherents in Kutchdullub aren't so sticky that it doesn't pay to see them now
  and then and spread more tanglefoot. He has a country villa where his medical
  adviser, whom you see behind me, tells him that the medicinal springs are
  curative of ulcers of the stomach. As the hope and ewe lamb of the high
  church party, it behooves him at certain seasons to be sacramented by the
  priests. The other four reasons are what I am here to find out. But why are
  you here?"</p>

  <p>"Me? I'm hoping," said Copeland. "I want to see Kutchdullub, and I want to
  shoot a tiger. There's a small dispensary in this town, and the Sikh in
  charge of it has offered to let me hold a clinic. So I'll stay here for the
  present. What did you mean by saying there is no such person as
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Am dead just now, as happens frequently. Was mixed up in a case near
  Quetta, and some murderers were hanged. But certain other murderers and
  friends of same were not caught, it being out of the question to catch and
  hang the total population; because no government is wise or reasonable; they
  always compromise: Therefore the C.I.D.&mdash;you have heard of it? Criminal
  Investigation Department&mdash;had me murdered and cremated as a precaution
  against revenge, and then removed me to this sweet solitude for a
  vacation."</p>

  <p>"Taking chances, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I never take them. One of them will take me some day. Until then I am
  taking long odds, but betting only on certainties."</p>

  <p>Copeland studied him a minute, while they both dipped spoons into
  abominable soup. He decided that the man's obesity might be as deceptive as
  his mild brown eyes and his almost bovine calm.</p>

  <p>"What I meant," he remarked, when thunder had ceased crashing, "is, why do
  you tell me your name and what you are? I might betray you."</p>

  <p>He was answered by a chuckle. Then: "Do you suppose the C.I.D. would send
  me here because I don't know the country intimately? Knowing, I am naturally
  known; and, once known, not so easy to forget! If His Highness the Rajah of
  Kutchdullub happens to be sober, his spies will tell him before midnight that
  you and I have dined together. So why should I observe secrecy towards you?
  On this side of the border what harm can you do me?"</p>

  <p>"Will they let you cross, or must you sneak in?" Copeland asked him.</p>

  <p>"I would go in with a brass band, if there were one," said the babu. "Some
  of them will welcome me as small boys do a teacher, telling me the little
  secrets better to conceal the big ones. For I tell you, that secrets are not
  kept by being secretive; nor can you discover them by looking like a
  questionnaire in a headsman's mask. But tell me, have you ever shot a
  tiger?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say I have," said Copeland. "But a fellow needs a steady nerve at
  my trade. There isn't much room for error when you operate on eyes, for
  instance. I can handle a rifle. I've a good one that I've used quite a bit.
  Say, look here! I don't know of anything that I can offer you, but perhaps
  you can think of something. You can get into Kutchdullub, and you're going. I
  want people suffering from cataract to come and see me. And I want to shoot a
  tiger. Help me in either of those respects, and name your <i>quid pro
  quo</i>. If I can match you, I will."</p>

  <p>Swiftly, penetratingly, and only once, the babu glanced at him; his brown
  eyes almost changed their shape during that fraction of a second, and their
  color glowed like amber with a light behind it. Then he looked down at his
  goat chop.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever gamble, sahib? Do you bet blind? Do you have an intuition
  that you trust against the evidence of all your senses?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Care to bet on me? I have a nuisance value. Not even God can guess the
  value of a nuisance, or He would not have created such a paradox. A nuisance
  is superior to Einstein's square root of minus one; that has no demonstrable
  existence but can solve a problem by creating greater ones. I would exact a
  promise."</p>

  <p>Thunder again, chain lightning, and a volley of rain on the iron roof. The
  man in the far corner washed his ruby in a tumbler, polished it on a napkin,
  turned up his overcoat collar and walked out, letting in a gust of wind that
  blew off tablecloths and smashed some crockery.</p>

  <p>"I would ask you to promise," said the babu, "not to cross the border into
  the State of Kutchdullub until I send for you or come and fetch you."</p>

  <p>"What's the big idea?"</p>

  <p>"Take no chances," said the babu. "Sahib, it is paradoxically true in this
  world that the simplest way to get what you are after is not to try to get
  it. Say no, and resist temptation when you mean yes and already have fallen
  for it like an apple on to Newton's nose."</p>

  <p>"O.K., I get you. Very well, I promise."</p>

  <p>"But I promise nothing," said the babu. "It is contrary to my religion to
  make any promise that I don't intend to break. I am a slave of my
  religion."</p>

  <p>"You're 'a high-caste Hindu, aren't you? How comes it that you eat with
  me, and eat meat?"</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose took up a bone in his fingers and gnawed it before he
  answered:</p>

  <p>"Sahib, why do you cut cataracts off eyeballs?"</p>

  <p>"For the practice. Hell, I'm learning!"</p>

  <p>"Same here! Self am also surgeon&mdash;of impossibilities! I amputate
  them. Why? For the experience. I like it. And one does not get experience by
  being holier than other people."</p>

  <p>"But the Hindu religion, as I understand it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't understand it, any more than I do, or the priests do," said the
  babu. "I am a devotee of all religions and all politics. I am an autocratic
  democratic absolutist, communistically minded&mdash;a pro-Gandhian believer
  in machine-made products. Also am a Nietzschean-Tolstoian Platonist with
  animistic leanings, balancing a pole, like Blondin on a tightrope, with a
  Bryanite bimetallism on the one end and a sense of humor on the other. I
  believe that governments are necessary nonsense, and that the only deadly sin
  is sorrow, whether you inflict it or accept it."</p>

  <p>"So you sign up with the C.I.D. and send men to the gallows?"</p>

  <p>"I? Their lack of humor hangs them! Clowns and other funny people never
  reach a gallows. It is people who take themselves seriously who slip up on
  their own solemnity, like politicians on a party platform. The secret of all
  the crimes there ever were, is self-importance. It is that&mdash;their
  self-importance, that eventually traps them."</p>

  <p>"All right, go and prod their self-importance, but remember, I want some
  cataract cases&mdash;and a tiger. You can reach me at the Sikh's dispensary.
  He wrote he has a bedroom for me, but I don't know the address yet. I'll have
  to wait here at the station until he shows up. Where will you be?"</p>

  <p>"Everywhere, sahib. I must splash around in this abominable monsoon,
  wishing I were Jonah in the belly of a whale. And I must go now. Thank you
  for the rotten dinner and the pleasant company. I wish you hecatombs of
  mutilated heads to study with your lancet."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, I hope you hang your man," said Copeland. "Bring him to me first,
  though, if his eyes need fixing."</p>

  <p>"Good-by, sahib. Don't come out into the rain." But curiosity compelled,
  so Copeland buttoned up his overcoat and watched three elephants go swaying
  off into the darkness loaded with a Prince and all his retinue. The station
  lights, reflected in a kind of misty halo by the rain, revealed even a
  glimpse of royalty&mdash;a lean, dark-turbaned, youngish man, a trifle
  stooping at the shoulders, perched up in the nickel-plated howdah with a
  heavy shawl over his English raincoat. He was taking himself, or something,
  seriously. He looked sad. But he swayed away into the rain and was lost in
  darkness before Copeland could even memorize his features.</p>

  <p>Then an <i>ekka</i> drove up for the babu&mdash;a one-horse, two-wheeled,
  springless cart, already piled up with the babu's baggage under a watertight
  tarpaulin. The babu's dish-faced servant was already up beside the driver.
  The babu climbed in and the cart creaked. The driver screamed at his decrepit
  horse. The babu pulled an end of the tarpaulin over him and waved his black
  umbrella&mdash;and suddenly, out of the station shadow, the two yellow-robed
  pilgrims ran like ghosts and climbed into the cart too.</p>

  <p>"Charity to holy people is a way of going long of riches in the next
  world!" the babu shouted. "Good-by, sahib."</p>

  <p>There was a frightful flash of lightning&mdash;seething rain &mdash;
  thunder&mdash;howling wind; lightning again, and a vivid glimpse of trees
  bent almost double&mdash;ruts through black mud&mdash;miles of muddy water.
  And then darkness.</p>

  <p>"It's a hell of a night," said Copeland to himself. He went back to the
  dismal dining-room and paid his bill. "Who was that man who had dinner with
  me?" he asked the waiter.</p>

  <p>"Some babu," he answered. "I not knowing."</p>

  <p>But he did know. He was too afraid of him to talk. The lamplight shone on
  too much of the bloodshot whites of his distended eyes.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">CHAPTER 2</a><br>
  "I am sent by Soonya"</h2>

  <p class="first">WIND rolled away the steam of two weeks' rain and gave a
  glimpse of tumbled mountains beyond lush green jungle. Out of the jungle
  poured a roaring river; coffee-brown, loaded with trash; it stank of dead
  things. Where, two weeks ago, the shallow ford had been, and village cattle
  came to drink, it boiled and eddied ten feet deep&mdash;impassable. A dozen
  mat-and-cotton, toe-rag camps were clustered on the side towards the city;
  there the traveling native merchants waited for the yearly race to be first
  in the field, to sell goods on credit while the peasants' rain-fed optimism
  rose like sap in green stuff.</p>

  <p>On the far side of the river, on a hillock, in a thatched shed built for
  him by villagers, Chullunder Ghose sat camped in luxury. He had crossed,
  before the river rose too high, on a log-raft that had been carried away by
  the next night's flood and left him stranded. He had exactly what he needed,
  and he needed extremely little. In an English Norfolk jacket, a Hindu
  loin-cloth and a plain black cotton turban, he looked rich enough to be
  important and yet not so rich that the villagers might feel afraid of him. He
  sat on a mat in the door of the shed; cross-legged, like a fat god, smiling.
  And since he paid his way, and certainly was not a tax-collector or
  policemen, the villagers came and talked to him between the storms of rain.
  Their talk was chiefly about taxes, and the priests, and the iniquitous
  forced labor when the Rajah needed porters for his hunting expeditions. They
  talked about the Prince who had come across the ford with three elephants,
  and who had actually paid them for firewood and elephant feed.</p>

  <p>"A good Prince. But he came near drowning. There was with him a Madrasi,
  with a red stone on his finger. When the Prince fell off the elephant in
  mid-stream that Madrasi pretended to try to rescue him. But we saw. And it
  was one of us who swam into the stream and saved him. He received for that a
  gift of two rupees from the Prince. But from the Madrasi he received a
  cursing. The Madrasi said a low-caste person should not touch the Prince's
  person. And that is true. But what would you?"</p>

  <p>They talked also of Gandhi. Gandhi, they had heard, was in London teaching
  the English how to use the hand-loom. Was it true, as some of Kali's priests
  said, that Gandhi intended to kick the English out and give the government to
  Moslems?</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose was patient. He declared he had to wait until the ford
  was passable. He asked no questions about tigers, none whatever about Kali's
  priests, or about the ruined temple in the jungle near by. If he had asked,
  he might have heard nothing. But, as usually happens to a good-tempered man
  who listens but is not inquisitive, what he wished to learn began to reach
  his ears in driblets. He was told, among many other things, the reason why,
  for instance, nobody came near him after four in the afternoon, and why the
  cattle were driven home so early.</p>

  <p>"He has slain six women, four men, five children, six-and-fifty goats and
  nineteen head of cattle. He is a male tiger. He is harder on us than the
  <i>takkus</i> [tax]. Our shikari should have set a trap or shot him, but he
  dared not, though he talked loud; and when we mocked him he ran away, we know
  not whither. It is not wise that your honor camps in this place, and if we
  had known how good your honor is we would have spoken. Come now and dwell in
  the village." Chullunder Ghose might have accepted the invitation, but the
  rain came down that minute, so a dozen villagers were forced to share the
  shed with him, and half a dozen more came running along the track at the edge
  of the jungle to take shelter. Five of them reached it, and the sixth was
  hardly fifty yards away when he suddenly screamed. A tiger leaped out from
  the undergrowth and struck him, seized him by the shoulder, worried him a
  moment and then dragged him out of sight. It was all over in ten seconds. But
  they heard the man scream in the jungle&mdash;once. After that, silence. It
  had happened phantom-fashion. Even the rain seemed silent and unreal.</p>

  <p>All the villagers took sticks and ran to beat the jungle. But it was
  useless, and they knew it. One by one they came back to squat and shudder in
  the babu's camp-fire smoke and ask advice.</p>

  <p>"Another widow to feed. That is the fifth man, making sixteen humans.
  Shall we abandon the village? But where then? There is no place for us."</p>

  <p>"Tell the Rajah," said the babu. "Is it not his business and privilege to
  deal with tigers?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, we have sent and told him. Long ago we told him, when the tiger
  slew the first man."</p>

  <p>"What else have you done?"</p>

  <p>"We have paid much money to the priests of Kali's temple. But the priests
  also do nothing."</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>"To the priestess we have given money. Her name is Soonya. It is her
  tiger. She lives in the ruined temple yonder in the jungle. The tiger lives
  there also."</p>

  <p>"Liars! Can she keep a tiger like a tame cat? If it eats you, would it not
  eat her?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, not so. Is she not a priestess? She is not like other people, sahib.
  Furthermore, she says the tiger will continue killing us and our cattle until
  the Rajah keeps a promise to rebuild the temple. Nevertheless, if he should
  do that he would first increase the <i>takkus</i>; and how can we pay it,
  since the tiger eats us and our cattle? Will your honor not speak to the
  Rajah?"</p>

  <p>"I would like to speak first to that priestess," said the babu. "Which of
  you will lead me to her?"</p>

  <p>There were no volunteers. There were fifty excuses, chief of which was
  that the hour was growing late; it would be dark in the jungle. Some of them
  even admitted they were too scared.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, in a few months, when the sun has dried it, we will burn the
  jungle. There is nothing to do until that time comes."</p>

  <p>"Except to get me an elephant. Get one. Go and do it!"</p>

  <p>But the nearest elephant was fifteen miles away. It belonged to a
  zamindar* notorious for meanness; he would demand too much money. The
  elephant would eat the food of thirty people. The mahout and two or three
  alleged grass-cutters would also demand rations and money. Probably the
  elephant would go sick. He might even die; and who would' be blamed for
  it?</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>zamindar, zemindar</i> (Hindi)&mdash;land-holder,
  land-owner, landlord, landed proprietor; farmer. Platt's <i><a href=

  <p>"Tell me then about this Soonya whom you call a priestess," said the
  babu.</p>

  <p>So they told him an endless story, that being the least they could do
  after refusing his other requests; and he believed some portions of it. None
  knew whence she first came. She was married, some said, at the age of ten
  years to a man so handsome that the gods were jealous of him. Therefore the
  gods slew him with a sickness. She wanted to die on his funeral pyre, as
  widows used to, and, it is rumored, that some do even to this day. But that
  was forbidden by the Sircar,* that is obstinate about such matters.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sircar, Sirkar</i> (Hindi, "head of
  affairs")&mdash;various meanings: 1) the State, the Government, the Supreme
  authority; also "the Master" or head of the domestic government. Thus a
  servant, if asked "Whose are those horses?" in replying "They are the
  sircar&rsquo;s," may mean according to circumstances, that they are
  Government horses, or that they belong to his own master. 2) In Bengal the
  word was applied to a domestic servant who is a kind of house-steward, keeps
  the accounts of household expenditure, and makes miscellaneous purchases for
  the family; also, in merchants' offices, to any native accountant or native
  employed in making purchases, etc. 3) Under the Mahommedan governments, as in
  the time of the Mogul Empire, and later in the Deccan, the word was applied
  to certain extensive administrative divisions of territory. <i><a href=

  <p>So she tried to starve herself to death, which also was forbidden. Sahibs
  took her to a hospital and fed her by force with a tube until she gave in and
  agreed to live. She was then sent to a Christian mission, and the padres
  taught her to deny caste. But she did not agree to the rest of the teaching,
  so she ran away. She became a sanyassin*&mdash;wandering, wandering with
  staff and begging bowl, and rumor had it that she went mad. But some say that
  the padres had already made her so.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>sanyassin</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a wandering religious
  beggar. For more information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanyasa">Sanyasa</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"We are all mad," said the babu. "If we were not, nobody would love us.
  How did she come to this place? Did she bring the tiger with her?"</p>

  <p>Opinions varied. Some said she had come before the tiger; some said
  afterwards. They all agreed, however, that at Kutchdullub she had adopted the
  terrible creed of Kali, which serves death, not life. It worships death and
  sings the praises of calamity. "Our fathers told us about Thuggee, sahib. Has
  your honor heard of that? The Thugs slew people as a sacrifice to Kali, the
  Destroyer. But the Sircar also made an end of Thuggee&mdash;some say."</p>

  <p>"I will cross the river," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, sahib! Not yet for a week, or for more than a week. It drowns
  men. Who can cross it?"</p>

  <p>"I will cross now."</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay! Tell us more about the dok-i-tar who skins eyes so that blind
  men see."</p>

  <p>"Lead me to the priestess, or I go now."</p>

  <p>"But we dare not. Is that killer not loose in the jungle? He is worse than
  she is."</p>

  <p>"Then I go at once. These"&mdash;he pointed to his odds and ends of
  baggage&mdash;"are in your keeping. Make me a raft of goatskins &mdash; tight
  ones&mdash;well sewn. Bring a long rope and a pole. And if I drown I hope the
  tiger eats you all."</p>

  <p>They pleaded&mdash;argued; but his mildness had vanished. He even beat
  them. So the goatskins that an Indian village never lacks were blown up tight
  and lashed together. Standing on that, the babu poled and paddled himself
  across, assisted by the rope that held the raft against the stream. It took
  him two hours. It was after nightfall, and he was almost fainting from
  exhaustion, when he crawled out on the far bank in a storm of wind and rain.
  He staggered to the nearest trader's bivouac, where a kerosene lantern made a
  warm glow in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Horses!" he commanded. "Harness up and drive me to the city!"</p>

  <p>Mocking voices answered. "Swim, thou mudfish! Sit in the mud thou fool,
  and pray for miracles! Thy belly holds more food than we have here&mdash;go
  and fill it with frogs!"</p>

  <p>"I am sent by Soonya," he answered.</p>

  <p>There was instant silence. Presently a man crawled out into the rain and
  thrust a lantern near the babu's face.</p>

  <p>"Who do you say sent you?"</p>

  <p>"Ask again, thou dog, and she herself shall answer! Harness up! She
  orders. I pay&mdash;twenty rupees."</p>

  <p>That was a mistake.</p>

  <p>"So? She? A priestess offers money for a service?"</p>

  <p>But the babu snapped back: "Atcha! I will keep my money. Ask her anything
  you wish to know. I will go and bring her."</p>

  <p>He turned away into the dark rain. The lantern followed.</p>

  <p>"Sahib! Sahib!"</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes later he was splashing into darkness toward Kutchdullub
  City in a hooded cart, behind two strong horses, munching at chapatis spread
  with hot spice. The driver asked no more questions.</p>

  <p>It appeared that Soonya was someone.</p>

  "Isn't that brute dead yet?"</h2>

  <p class="first">DIVINELY authorized and autocratic sounds good, but it seems
  that liabilities invariably balance assets, somehow, even in the Rajah
  business. To begin with, it was monsoon weather. The marble and limestone
  palace, with its terraces, courtyards, gardens, summer-houses and lotus-ponds
  was one desolate splash made drearier by hurrying dark-gray clouds. There
  were creditors out on the palace steps, bemartyring themselves beneath
  umbrellas. The walls dripped clammy moisture. There was mildew on the
  hangings. The canaries in gilded cages were molting miserably and refused to
  sing. The Rajah had the bellyache, a headache, and a letter from a
  banker&mdash;a swine of a banker&mdash;a dirty, contemptible son of a
  low-caste shroff,* who demanded his interest and "found it inconvenient" to
  lend another rupee. Nor was that all.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>shroff</i> (Hindi from Arabic)&mdash;a banker or
  money changer in the Far East; especially: one who tests and evaluates coin.
  <i><a href=
  "http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=shroff">Merriam-Webster

  Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi, and English</i></a>. ]</p>

  <p>The zenana* hummed with malice, like a wasps' nest being smoked out. The
  most recent recruit to the Rajah's private ménage was a lady with a genius
  for spending money and a magnetism that exploded all the stores of jealousy
  and discontent that she could anywhere discover.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>zenana</i> (Hindi)&mdash;the part of a house in
  Asian countries reserved for the women of the household. <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenana">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>There is plenty of both in a Rajah's zenana, always. And today it is not
  nearly as safe as in the good old days of twenty years ago to use the whip;
  because even in Indian Native States there are women who know about modern
  notions. They inform the others. And any woman understands that one does not
  have to believe things in order to try to get away with them.</p>

  <p>So the Rajah was in his library, where the books were all soggy with
  moisture; and even the brandy and soda did not taste good, because he had
  drunk too much of it the night before. His servant had left the lid of the
  cigar-box open, so the cigars were ruined; they tasted like hay and
  blotting-paper&mdash;two rupees each. The cat looked happy, sleeping on a
  cushion near the smelly oil-stove. So he kicked it, and that settled the cat
  for a while. Then he got up and looked in the mirror&mdash;a full-length one,
  behind which was a closet of books such as even a Rajah does not let the
  servants see.</p>

  <p>There was a damp film on the mirror, but he could see himself. He had
  never had any faith in religion except as an important form of politics; but
  the sight of himself in the glass nearly, if not quite, convinced him that a
  diabolical intelligence does actually govern things. How otherwise could such
  a handsome fellow, so endowed by nature with a figure, a brain, and a taste
  for smart clothes and expensive entertainment, find himself in such a damned
  predicament? No answer. He made a grimace at himself in the glass.</p>

  <p>Then he pressed an electric bell; but rain had discovered the places where
  a rascally contractor had saved money on the insulation, so the bell was
  silent. After waiting a few minutes he seized a revolver and fired it five
  times at the bell-push. He was a good shot, even with all that brandy in him,
  so he hit the mark three times, but it annoyed him that he missed twice; and
  the noise made the cat act like a lunatic, so he put the sixth shot through
  the cat's head. Then the servant came. He might possibly have shot the
  servant&mdash;it would have cost less than to whip a woman&mdash;only that
  the cartridges were all used up.</p>

  <p>"Take away that cat and tell Syed-Suraj I want him."</p>

  <p>The servant left the cat's blood on the carpet and ran like a marauding
  jackal with the carcass. Syed-Suraj was the only one to run for when the
  Rajah was in that mood. Discreetly vicious sycophant and rapacious grafter
  though he was, Syed-Suraj could be depended on to calm the Rajah's humor even
  when the last new female favorite was afraid to go near him. A relation,
  distant, on the distaff side; an educated sybarite, whose estates had all
  been squandered in Madrid, Heidelberg, Paris, London, and Monte Carlo,
  Syed-Suraj had equipped himself with cynicism and a charming manner that the
  Rajah and Syed-Suraj, too, mistook for statesmanship. But Syed-Suraj was a
  lot too shrewdly cautious to accept an official position. It suited him
  better, and so did the pickings, to be the Rajah's confidant, pander,
  parasite, and go-between.</p>

  <p>He entered briskly. There was a flower on the lapel of his well-cut
  British suit. He looked well, lithe, humorous. His olive skin, fresh from the
  barber, shone with apparent youth, although he was almost fifty years of age.
  He was a small-boned man, with rather hairy hands and small feet. Nothing
  about him except his eyes suggested danger, importance, or even much
  experience. But the crows' feet at the corners told their tale, and his eyes
  were slightly simian, brown, brilliant, a bit too close together, with a
  habit of narrowing slightly after one swift, penetrating glance.</p>

  <p>He sat down, He and the Rajah usually conversed in French or English to
  avoid being understood by servants, who were always lurking where they should
  not and who always carried tales to the zenana. The Rajah scowled. Syed-Suraj
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"You'll be dead soon," he remarked, "so be gay. Let the money-lenders
  worry."</p>

  <p>"Damn the money-lenders," said the Rajah. "I would sell my entire State
  for the price of a trip to Europe."</p>

  <p>"But you can't, dear boy. It's mortgaged for more than it's worth. Why be
  impractical? Besides, imagine what might happen if you went away. You know as
  well as I do that the priests are playing poker with a whole pack up their
  sleeves. They'd frame you in your absence. They already accuse you of
  neglect&mdash;of withholding temple revenues&mdash;of personal
  defilement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That last was a sore point and the Rajah sputtered, cursing the priests of
  Kali in a language enriched by ages for just that purpose. The expense of
  being undefiled was bad enough&mdash;they have a special rate for
  Rajahs&mdash;but the worst part was the tedious ceremonies. He shuddered to
  think of them.</p>

  <p>"And," said Syed-Suraj, "they again demand fulfillment of your promise to
  rebuild that damned old temple in the jungle. You would have made that
  promise over my dead body, had I been here when you came to the throne."</p>

  <p>"But, damn your eyes, I had to make it," said the Rajah. "They pretended
  they knew all about my elder brother's death. If a lying rumor had come to
  the ears of the British that he died of poison&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that might have been inconvenient. But rumor and proof, dear boy,
  are not the same thing, even if your brother's death was slightly opportune,
  and even if he was cremated rather in a hurry. The point is now, that you
  can't keep your promise about that because you lack the necessary funds. They
  know that. Nevertheless, they are using pressure&mdash;propaganda &mdash; and
  that tiger. If you shoot the tiger they will charge you with sacrilege, which
  won't cut any ice except with half the population, who will probably refuse
  to pay their taxes. Swallow that one! If you don't go and shoot the tiger you
  will hear from Smith about it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn Smith! Damn his middle-class morality! Oh, damn his father and his
  mother and his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Smith is all right," said Syed-Suraj. "As a representative of the British
  Raj at the court of a reigning Prince he is rather a joke, I admit&mdash;or a
  bore, whichever way you look at it. But what if he weren't lazy and had some
  brains and self-respect? You're lucky to have such a fossil to deal with.
  When he retires on pension, two or three months from now, you'll be out of
  luck; there can't be two politicals like Smith in India, and if there were,
  the law of averages would keep them from sending the other to succeed this
  man. I advise you to get things straightened out before a new man comes in
  Smith's place."</p>

  <p>"To hell with the British!"</p>

  <p>"Not so loud!" said Syed-Suraj. "They, too, have their difficulties, but
  their ears are as long as a mule's and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Blather! Their day's done. They've lost their grip on India&mdash;lost
  it, I tell you. They'll be gone in a couple of years. And then the deluge.
  Then we'll have the old times back again."</p>

  <p>"Not yet! And meanwhile, Smith will be compelled to make himself a
  nuisance. How can he help it? The British have sent that fat scoundrel,
  Chullunder Ghose, to spy and report&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Rajah sat suddenly upright. "Isn't that brute dead yet? I
  arranged&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj interrupted: "Yes, I know you did, and it was very thoughtless.
  He's the C.I.D.'s pet undercover man. Do you remember when he came two years
  ago and asked you to employ Hawkes? Do you remember I cautioned you not to
  refuse? He wanted Hawkes placed here to keep an eye on you. If you had turned
  Hawkes down, Chullunder Ghose would have flooded the State with Hindu spies,
  and those dogs would have framed you for the sake of their own advancement;
  whereas Hawkes plays cricket. Nobody could make Hawkes tell a lie or shirk
  work. He's a good servant and he saves you money."</p>

  <p>"All right," said the Rajah, "but Chullunder Ghose is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Sui generis</i>. He might be much worse. Bump him off&mdash;and see
  then what descends on you! It might be utterly impossible to prove you
  ordered it, but nobody would doubt it. The C.I.D. would be out for revenge;
  they value that man. They would send a mob of expert second-raters, who would
  do exactly what the priests want&mdash;frame you and force you to abdicate.
  The priests, you know as well as I do, want your cousin on the throne."</p>

  <p>"He'll never get there," said the Rajah. "He already has what he thinks
  are ulcers of the stomach. If your doctor from Madras is half as good as you
  pretend, the priests will soon have the mortification of conducting funeral
  ceremonies for their darling nominee for my throne. I see humor in that."</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj blew his nose and glanced at the Rajah's face over his
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, "his death won't help you at the moment. Neither
  would it help in the least to kill that fat babu."</p>

  <p>"I have ordered him killed."</p>

  <p>"Then countermand it."</p>

  <p>"It is too late."</p>

  <p>"He is probably your best friend in the circumstances. He is not a
  trouble-maker. He has a genius for pulling the plugs of trouble and letting
  it pour down the drain. That is undoubtedly why the C.I.D. have sent
  him."</p>

  <p>"He is dead," said the Rajah. "That is, he's as good as dead."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to hear it. I can't do any more than give you good advice."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, you can." The Rajah stood up. He chested himself. He struck the
  attitude that always had effect with certain sorts of women, but that did not
  deceive Syed-Suraj for a moment. "Take my Rolls-Royce, and go and borrow
  money for me. Go to Ram Dass; he has plenty."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five percent," said Syed-Suraj.</p>

  <p>"What do I care?"</p>

  <p>"He will also take a note for twenty-five percent more than he really
  lends you."</p>

  <p>"I will sign it."</p>

  <p>"And Ram Dass will show your note to the priests."</p>

  <p>"To hell with them!"</p>

  <p>"They will say you now have money and must rebuild that temple
  immediately."</p>

  <p>"What? During the monsoon? Impossible! Go and get me some money."</p>

  <p>"You might offer me a little <i>douceur</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it, what becomes of all the money that you wheedle from me?"</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj closed his eyes a trifle. Then he contrived to look hurt.</p>

  <p>"Any one of the servant-girls in your zenana costs you more than I do," he
  retorted. "Most of what you give me is spent on your business&mdash;on
  informers, for instance. Do you think spies work for nothing?"</p>

  <p>"I am certain you don't," said the Rajah. "Dammit&mdash;all
  right&mdash;five percent. And don't ask for another rupee for a twelve-month.
  Do you hear me?"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">CHAPTER 4</a><br>
  "This is from the fat babu who ate your dinner"</h2>

  <p class="first">ACROSS the border, five hundred yards from the railway
  station, in a corrugated iron barn that faced a yard at the back of the
  Sikh's dispensary, by the light of a gasoline lantern Stanley Copeland
  labored and forgot the weather. Rain drove in between the joints of the iron
  walls and drummed on the iron roof. Sometimes the lantern blew out at
  critical moments and the Sikh had to come to the rescue with his flashlight.
  The operating table was a thing of planks and trestles that had to be
  scrubbed at intervals with soap and water. There was a very slim supply of
  anaesthetics, and the Sikh was ignorant as well as nervous, although willing.
  There were no nurses &mdash; no trained help whatever.</p>

  <p>But the Sikh had snatched at opportunity. The moment he was sure Copeland
  really would come he had gone hard at work at propaganda. He had promised
  that the greatest surgeon in the world would operate, free, gratis, and for
  nothing, on anyone, no matter who he was or what might be the matter with
  him. And the only reason why the Sikh had not been at the train to meet
  Copeland was that his dispensary was chock-a-block with patients clamoring
  for first turn. He had had to drive them out into the rain and lock the door
  on them before daring to leave the place; they might have wrecked it.</p>

  <p>So, instead of restricting himself to eyes, with occasional side-ventures
  to an ear or throat, Copeland had been forced to tackle almost all the
  horrible and crippling ailments known to Asia. He had amputated gangrened
  legs, attended to enlarged spleens, opened abscesses, adjusted and set
  compound fractures, cauterized dog-bites, treated ague, diagnosed and taken
  chances with afflicted kidneys, livers&mdash;anything and everything. And
  luck was with him, as it usually is with men who pull their coats off and go
  straight ahead at what needs doing, even though they don't know how to do it.
  Nobody had died yet on the operating table. Seven days, of fourteen hours'
  work each, had gone by and the waiting list still grew. The sleepless Sikh
  was half-hysterical, but happy. Copeland had begun to dream he really might
  amount to something some day, which is half the battle. He could see himself
  getting the high-priced custom in Chicago or New York. And then a messenger
  arrived&mdash;a dish-faced messenger.</p>

  <p>He came in grinning, dripping, with a flour-sack hooded on his head and
  shoulders. He was otherwise naked except for a breech-cloth. In his hand he
  held a cleft stick, in which a note was tied securely, wrapped in a scrap of
  goatskin. He refused to wait outside although a cancerous nose was being
  amputated. He refused to give the message to the Sikh. He forced his way in
  and waited patiently, amused by the removal of the nose and now and then
  feeling his own to make sure it was still there. When the job was finished
  and he had given up the note to Copeland, he offered to help scrub the
  operating table. He was not in the least discouraged or offended by the
  Sikh's rebuff, but watched the Sikh's assistant for a minute and then, being
  quite a person, pushed the incompetent duffer aside and did the whole job
  perfectly, in quick time.</p>

  <p>Copeland lit his pipe with the fourth or fifth match&mdash;matches and
  tobacco being damp. Then he studied the note before he opened it. He only
  vaguely recognized the dish-faced man and was not really sure he remembered
  him. There was nobody who ought to write to him; no one, in fact whom he knew
  on the country-side. The thing suggested trouble, or perhaps an urgent call
  for surgical help in some outlying district, so he scowled at it. However, he
  was the kind of man who likes to hit his troubles on the snout, not run away.
  So at last he opened it. The address read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"To the Skin 'em alive-o Doctor sahib at the Sikh's
  dispensary.&mdash;From Babu C.G."</p><br>

  <p>That was impudent, but not discouraging. Besides, the messenger was a
  genuine human being with a good grin, who appeared to believe in working
  while he waited. That, too, was a favorable sign. He unfolded the paper and
  read on:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"This is from the fat babu who ate your dinner. Cheerio.
  How are you? Please excuse the paper, but the nearest shop is more than
  twenty miles away and the miles are mud if you can find them under water. I
  am curious to know if you are still premeditating battle with a tiger? Or
  have you slain so many people on the operating table that the thought of even
  lawful murder sickens you? If you are still ferocious, oil your gun but wait
  for kubber.* If you are still the gentlemanly sportsman that I took you for,
  be kind enough to hold your tongue about it, because silence feeds no flies,
  of which there are a lot too many. Please send back an answer by this
  messenger and tell me whether you would back your skill against a
  belly-trouble, said to be an ulcer but suspected by me to be more of a family
  token of regard. It might be possible to bag the tiger and assault the ulcer
  at the same time. Point is: will you do it?[BR] [BR] "Please don't pay the
  messenger, it spoils him. Give him two spots of the cheapest whisky you can
  get and kick him forth to come and find me with your answer. Hoping the
  supply of crushed and otherwise intriguing eyes is holding out; and wishing
  with all my heart that you were here to buy me drinks and dinner &mdash;
  alas, I have none of either! I remain, Your Honor's most respectful
  servant,<br>
  <br>
  "C.G.<br>
  <br>
  "P.S.&mdash;And remember, there is no such person!"</p><br>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>kubber, khubber</i> (Hindi)&mdash;'news,'
  especially as a sporting term; news of game, e.g. "There is pucka khubber of
  a tiger this morning." <a href=

  <p>Copeland thought a minute&mdash;thought of the work to be done where he
  was, and of the mud and the rain outside. He almost tore the note up &mdash;
  almost told the messenger to say "no answer." But the messenger grinned and
  the grin was good. And he remembered then that the fat babu had smiled like
  someone who was safe to bet on. So he handed the messenger two rupees and
  told him:</p>

  <p>"Go and buy yourself some whisky. Come back when you've drunk it."</p>

  <p>Then he wrote on a piece of dispensary paper:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"From S.C. to C.G. This is a telegram. Try me. I don't
  believe you."</p><br>

  <p>He folded it, sealed it with a lump of candle-grease, impressed his
  thumb-mark, wrapped it in the goatskin, tied it in the cleft stick, set it
  where the messenger could see it on a stool beside the door, then:</p>

  <p>"Come on," he said to the Sikh, "bring in your next case. At this rate
  it'll be midnight before we've done a day's work."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">CHAPTER 5</a><br>
  "I need a new knife, sahib"</h2>

  <p class="first">CHULLUNDER GHOSE sat in the dark cart, enjoying motion after
  days of sitting still and being talked to by ignorant villagers. It was slow
  motion; the big wheels sank deep in the mud and the horses paused at frequent
  intervals to gather strength; but the horses were as keen as the driver on
  reaching the journey's end, so they pulled their best. The silence&mdash;he
  enjoyed that also&mdash;was comparative; the important thing was that the
  driver made no conversation. Countless millions of frogs made such a din that
  he could hardly hear the splashing of the horses' hoofs or the squeak of an
  oil-less wheel. But none of those facts excused carelessness; the business of
  being "purposely misunderstood" demands unceasing and acute attention.</p>

  <p>It may be that the comfort of a heavy blanket made him sleepy. He felt
  sure, too, that he had left behind a village that was friendly to himself,
  whatever hatreds or intrigues might dwell there. But probably he himself
  could not have told exactly why he let his normally alert and intensely
  intelligent senses slumber while he mused and pondered. He was chuckling over
  the letter he had sent by messenger to Doctor Copeland, and envying the
  almost superhuman skill and courage of the messenger who swam that swollen
  ford without as much as hesitating on the brink, when his turban fell over
  his eye and he felt a blow on the back of the head that almost stunned him.
  But he had felt the blow. He could still feel it. Therefore he knew he was
  not too badly hurt, and in the dark the odds were in his favor yet, whoever
  the enemy might be. Between him and the driver was a curtain of heavy cloth
  that made the inside of the cart so absolutely dark that he knew his
  assailant must have struck at random. Probably some enemy had crawled in over
  the cart-tail and was now crouching amid the litter of empty sacks and
  goatskins, waiting to see what his blow had accomplished. Those thoughts took
  a fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>In another fraction of a second Chullunder Ghose had stripped his blanket
  off and bulked it, holding it at arm's length in his left hand. Beneath it,
  with his left foot, he kicked on the floor of the cart to suggest his own
  whereabouts. He felt a club hit the blanket. He pounced. A man as wet as a
  fish, and as slippery, writhed in his grasp, and even the babu's prodigious
  strength was hardly enough to hold him; he had to grab the man's hair and
  almost strangle him with his left arm while he thumped him breathless with
  his right knee. The driver heard the intense, swift struggle, and pulled the
  curtain aside to ask what the trouble might be. Chullunder Ghose mastered his
  breath:</p>

  <p>"Another passenger. He overtook us. I invited him to ride."</p>

  <p>"He should pay," said the driver. "Such a journey as this may break my
  cart and harm my horses. It is enough that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is enough that your crows' meat pull so feebly that this cripple
  overtook us!" the babu retorted. "Drive on. I will pay you with a kick in the
  teeth if I hear another word from you!"</p>

  <p>"Shameless ingrate! I will turn back," said the driver.</p>

  <p>"Try it! See what happens!"</p>

  <p>It was too late to turn back; it was already nearly as far to the
  encampment by the ford as it was to the city. And to turn about meant facing
  wind and rain. The driver made a virtue of convenience.</p>

  <p>"I made a promise. It is better that I keep it. I will pray your honor to
  be generous."</p>

  <p>He closed the curtain, and Chullunder Ghose relaxed the pressure on his
  assailant's throat, but he did not let go of his hair. He seized an arm and
  twisted it.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he demanded. "Besides being a jungle-bum with less brains
  than an animal, what are you?"</p>

  <p>"Have pity, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Answer before I break your neck, you murderer!"</p>

  <p>"And if I answer, what then?"</p>

  <p>"Pity, perhaps; and perhaps a thrashing; possibly a rupee. Who knows? Was
  it Soonya who sent you?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, sahib! We of the village laid our heads together."</p>

  <p>"And the honey of united wisdom came forth?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, we thought if your honor should make complaint in the city about
  the tiger, then there might be trouble from the priestess."</p>

  <p>"You should have said that to me before I left you."</p>

  <p>"But we did not think of it until your honor crossed the river. Then we
  guessed that your honor had lied about being a spokesman for the dok-i-tar
  sahib who skins eyes. Some said you are probably a politician; and we agreed
  that much trouble might come, and of that we have plenty, without more of
  it."</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose jerked at the man's hair. As an afterthought he groped
  for the club and laid it out of reach. "For instance?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"First, a sahib might come. It might be Smith sahib, who would command the
  services of many people and much food for his servants, who would beat us.
  And the servants would pay us nothing, even though their sahib might give
  them money for the purpose. Or perhaps the Rajah himself might come, and that
  would be much worse."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"She would put a curse on us for having made complaint."</p>

  <p>"Who? Soonya? That priestess?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib. She might carry out her threat to loose on us a second
  tiger&mdash;a she-one&mdash;much worse."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh."</p>

  <p>"So it seemed best&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To silence me by killing me, eh? How did you cross the river?"</p>

  <p>"That was easy, since your honor let the raft get caught to the far bank
  by a tree-root. Was there not the rope? We drew that tight and I crossed by
  it, hand over hand, being better used to such dangerous work than the others.
  Was it not I who received a reward for rescuing a Prince in mid-stream? And
  having crossed I sought a club, but it was difficult to find one in the
  darkness. The one I cut at last was too light. Thus the blow I struck was
  feeble and your honor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is your knife, with which you cut that club?" the babu asked
  him.</p>

  <p>"It was in my loin-cloth. But it fell in the mud when I slipped, as I
  tried to crawl silently into the cart. Otherwise I could have used it, and
  your honor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will give you a new knife," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"That is generous. But it is only fair. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With which to cut your own throat for being such a frog-brained
  jungli!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>jungli, junglee</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a savage; a
  primitive native; a "man of the woods." See the <i><a href=

  website. ]</p>

  <p>"Nay, I will need it badly for my work in the fields when the rains are
  over."</p>

  <p>"If I let you sit there near the cart-tail will you jump off and run
  home?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I need a new knife, sahib. Where can we buy it unless in the
  city?"</p>

  <p>"Then what?"</p>

  <p>"I will go home. I will tell them in the village you are one whose heart
  is so big that it swells your belly. They will excuse my failure when I show
  the new, expensive knife."</p>

  <p>"Clothe yourself with sacks. Sit silent. I am sick of talking to you."</p>

  <p>So the cart creaked on and there was no more conversation. Wind, rain,
  trees, and frogs united in an ocean-chorus; it was easy to imagine that the
  cart was a boat on a storm-tossed sea. The villager, almost invisible even
  against the sky at the open cart-end; sat with his chin on his knees and
  seemed to meditate. Chullunder Ghose, wrapped in his blanket, cuddled himself
  at the front end, in a corner, undiscoverable even to a bat's eyes, it was so
  dark. Even when the jolting of the cart-wheels moved him he was quite
  invisible.</p>

  <p>The cart stopped. Someone spoke to the driver. Chullunder Ghose, ear to
  the curtain, caught the driver's answer.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I am from this side of the ford. I know not who he is."</p>

  <p>"Is he a fat man?"</p>

  <p>"Look within the cart and judge that for yourself."</p>

  <p>Footsteps splashed around the cart. Someone hooded in a flour sack leaned
  in, from the rear. At the same time there was a faint click, but to the
  trained ears of the babu it was clearly not a pistol. It was probably a
  flashlight, damaged by rain, short-circuited, useless. A man swore
  scurrilously.</p>

  <p>"Who is in here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>The villager stirred uneasily. The man seized him and dragged him out into
  the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Who else is in there?"</p>

  <p>"No one," said the villager.</p>

  <p>"Not a babu? Not a very fat man? Not he who was camped beyond the
  river?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay! I am from that village. I have seen that fat one&mdash;I have
  spoken with him. He is still there. How could he have crossed the river?"</p>

  <p>"How did you cross?"</p>

  <p>"On a horse&mdash;but it drowned the horse. I, clinging to its tail, was
  thrown up on the bank on this side."</p>

  <p>"Why are you traveling?"</p>

  <p>"To reach the dok-i-tar. My eyes fail and I fear I go blind. I have heard
  there is a sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Stealthily Chullunder Ghose moved to the cart-tail, the villager's club in
  his fist. The frog-noise and the rain that spattered on the roof effectually
  drowned any noise he made. He crouched in the corner opposite to where the
  villager had sat.</p>

  <p>"You jungli, you are lying!" said the voice in outer darkness. "He who
  drives said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Unexpectedness was two-thirds of Chullunder Ghose's method, and the other
  third was use of intuition. He decided there was only one man to be dealt
  with. He sprang&mdash;two hundred and fifty pounds of suddenness and muscle.
  He struck with the club with all his might. Luck aided him. Square on the top
  of a skull the club broke in two and the man went down into a puddle like a
  pole-axed steer. The babu set a foot on him. He waited; there might be
  someone else; although he guessed not.</p>

  <p>"See who he is," he commanded presently. The villager
  knelt&mdash;felt&mdash;pulled at something.</p>

  <p>"Nay, your honor means, who was he? He is dead now. And he had this."</p>

  <p>He thrust a heavy, old-fashioned revolver into the babu's hand. By its
  weight&mdash;by the balanceless feel of it Chullunder Ghose guessed, almost
  beyond the possibility of error, that it came from the Rajahs armory. The
  Rajah's private weapons were as new and costly as caprice could dictate and
  his credit provide, but his soldiers and policemen&mdash;and his murderers
  and bullies&mdash;had to use what other armies sold as bargains fifty years
  ago. However, the babu struck a match to make sure, recognized the Rajah's
  monogram on the holster worn by a man in plain clothes who lay prone in a
  puddle, and then threw the revolver away. He heard it splash into a deep
  hole.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure he is dead? I also think so. Get into the cart."</p>

  <p>He climbed in too, and resumed his blanket in the corner.</p>

  <p><i>"Cheloh!"</i>* he commanded, drawing aside the curtain. "Why do we
  wait? Are the horses as stupid as you?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Cheloh!</i> (Hindi)&mdash;Giddy-up! Get moving!
  ]</p>

  <p>The driver whipped and yelled. The cart creaked forward and the rain came
  down in blustering squalls that almost blew the roof off. It was several
  minutes before Chullunder Ghose even attempted to make his voice heard. Then
  he moved a little closer to the villager and asked him:</p>

  <p>"Did I say you are a frog-brained jungli?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it is not true."</p>

  <p>"I repeat it. You wished to kill me. That man would have done it for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I guessed that, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, did you tell those lies and say I was not in here?"</p>

  <p>"I need a new knife, don't I?"</p>

  <p>"Krishna! You shall have a good one," said the babu. "I can use such a
  madman as you are!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">CHAPTER 6</a><br>
  "The trouble with impossibilities is that they so often happen"</h2>

  <p class="first">MAJOR EUSTACE SMITH, aged fifty-four and rather seedy for
  his years, lay in bed at the Residency. There was nothing much wrong except
  for a boil on the back of his neck, which made him irritable. The damp and
  the dripping of rain depressed him; and, since the doctor went on leave, he
  had been lonely, although he and the doctor detested each other as only two
  bachelors can who have no other society than each other for months at a time.
  He enjoyed not having to have breakfast with the doctor, even though he
  missed him and needed his attentions now. Bed was comfortable. Office details
  were obnoxious to a military man&mdash;of the old school, dammit!&mdash;and
  there was nothing his clerk could not attend to; his successor, three months
  hence, might suit himself and find as much fault with the clerk as he
  pleased. In the meantime, the less business the better. Three
  months&mdash;then a pension, thank God!&mdash;and a little cottage in
  Madeira, where a fellow can live cheaply and enjoy the climate.</p>

  <p>However, as he reached for a book and a cigarette he saw a scorpion on the
  pillow. Scorpions made him half-hysterical. He slew the thing and yelled for
  his servant; and by the time the servant came he was too upset to take things
  easy any longer. He swore at the servant and made him examine
  everything&mdash;clothes in the closet, boots, suitcases, curtains. Then he
  put on slippers and his bathrobe, changed the bandage on his boil and decided
  to try the veranda that faced the Residency garden&mdash;a mere patch of
  shrubbery and draggled flowers circled by a high stone wall. He ordered tea
  brought out there.</p>

  <p>It always annoyed him to be interrupted at his morning tea. As a soldier
  he had had to rise at five a.m. or earlier and attend to all sorts of
  details. But "political life," according to Smith's view, called for military
  dignity, not military rigor. He still wore his graying moustache in fierce,
  waxed points, and he was ramrod-straight, however lazy he might feel. But
  business before eleven in the morning? No, sir! Not except in grave
  emergency.</p>

  <p>So he swore when his servant brought out word to the veranda that Hawkes
  sahib wished to see him. It was bad enough to be expected to interview any
  one at that hour. But he especially detested retired infantry sergeants who
  eked out their pensions by staying in India and getting jobs in Native
  States. Such fellows ought to live in England, where they have equals and
  where their rotten manners consequently clash less with the social standards
  of their betters.</p>

  <p>However, he knew Hawkes could not be exactly looking forward to the
  interview; he had been to particular pains to impress on Hawkes that he was
  not a welcome visitor. So he supposed there was some news that Hawkes, at any
  rate, believed important.</p>

  <p>"Show the man in," he commanded. "Take that other chair away. I'll keep
  him standing."</p>

  <p>Hawkes stood five feet ten in heavy boots and a ready-made English serge
  suit. He had left his waterproof outside, and he came to attention from old
  habit, so that his fine figure showed to advantage and made Smith look and
  feel slack as he sat staring at him in pajamas, stocking-less feet, slippers,
  not yet shaven. Smith, conscious of the contrast, decided to begin by taking
  Hawkes down a peg or two.</p>

  <p>"A pity," he said, "that a man of your physique should loaf his days away
  when England needs guts and muscle. Native States are no place for pensioned
  soldiers. What good are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"I seem to satisfy His Highness, sir."</p>

  <p>"Don't you flatter yourself?"</p>

  <p>"And I'm keeping off the dole two sisters, one down with
  tuberculosis&mdash;and my mother."</p>

  <p>"Keeping them in idleness, I don't doubt."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I'm not idle. And I didn't come here to waste your time. There
  is something I think you ought to know, sir."</p>

  <p>Smith's eyes glared with irritation.</p>

  <p>"I have told you before, Hawkes, I have very reliable sources of
  information. Nothing goes on in the state that I don't know about before you
  know it. I resent your interference. Unless you know of something that I
  don't know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's about that tiger near the village beyond the river."</p>

  <p>"Bah! That old wives' story! Let me tell you something for your own good.
  The political significance of tales like that is wrapped up in obscurity too
  deep for inexperience to penetrate. I heard it long ago: a woman in the
  jungle is supposed to possess a man-eating tiger that destroys whole
  villages. Well, put it in your pipe and smoke it! It's a mare's nest. It's a
  bit of local politics, in which His Highness and the priests are engaged in
  jockeying for influence. If I hear of you taking a hand, I warn you, I shall
  insist on the Rajah getting rid of you at once."</p>

  <p>"You threatened that before, sir; but he can't. I've a contract. I don't
  wish to show you disrespect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd better not!"</p>

  <p>"And politics don't mean a thing to me," said Hawkes, "but I intend to do
  my job. When I tell you that there's a tiger killing people&mdash;and that
  the Rajah nor anyone else'll do a thing about it&mdash;you may make up your
  mind that I'm telling the truth."</p>

  <p>"Is that so? Very well, Sergeant Know-it-all, why don't you go yourself
  and shoot the tiger?"</p>

  <p>"Because of politics and me not touching 'em. My job is inspecting stores
  and checking sales and purchases."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Why not, then, attend to business?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir. I've reported. Thank you for the interview. Good
  morning."</p>

  <p>Smith did not even answer him. He scowled. As soon as Hawkes had left he
  got up and began pacing the veranda.</p>

  <p>"Dammit, I suppose I ought to go myself and shoot the bloody tiger; that
  'ud stop this particular feud for a while. The brute is killing
  people&mdash;no doubt of that. But in this weather? And with boils on my
  neck! Mud&mdash;rain&mdash;snakes&mdash;malaria&mdash;and then a tiger in a
  ruined temple? Fat chance for a pension I'd have! Somebody would draw my
  life-insurance! And I'm not here to do the Rajah's dirty work. I think I'll
  send for Syed-Suraj. That's it. He's a slimy devil, but he has tact. He can
  put it to the Rajah unofficially that something has got to be done about
  this&mdash;and done now. That's it. Diplomacy. Nothing in writing that would
  call for explanations to the Foreign Office. Keep away from red tape. Yes,
  I'll send for Syed-Suraj."</p>

  <p>Europe, profligacy, and the need to refinance himself by stealth had
  educated Syed-Suraj to an understanding of the value, among other things, of
  promptness in his dealings with the nervous, Nordic blonde. He arrived almost
  too soon for Smith to be shaved, and he had to wait in the outer office,
  where he fingered correspondence while the office babu's back was turned. He
  was amused to read that the C.I.D. requested prompt attention to the
  forwarding of Number D.3's confidential reports; and the Department
  authorized D.3 to draw whatever sums he might need up to Rs. 250, against his
  own voucher.</p>

  <p>One other letter equally amused him. The Foreign Office, in view of
  strained political conditions, urged that foreigners&mdash;particularly
  doctors&mdash;should be discouraged from entering Native States unless
  provided with a special Foreign Office passport. The attention of the Foreign
  Office had been called to instances where aliens, possessed of medical skill
  and enthusiasm, but having no political experience, had acted indiscreetly
  and contributed to local unrest by exciting caste prejudice. Smith came in
  before he had a chance to read the other letters. Smith invited him into the
  library, replete with volumes of the Indian Census, law-books, and the works
  of Edgar Wallace. They sat down facing each other in front of the
  oil-stove.</p>

  <p>"How are you?"</p>

  <p>"How is His Highness?"</p>

  <p>The polite formalities took half a minute. Then there was a rather awkward
  pause, unbroken by Syed-Suraj, who was half afraid that the news of the death
  of Chullunder Ghose already might have reached Smith's ears. It was news that
  would have to break sooner or later. His eyes were alert, hard, less simian,
  more brilliant.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you and I have a friendly chat," said Smith; "no witnesses."</p>

  <p>"A pleasure, I assure you."</p>

  <p>"Unofficial, of course."</p>

  <p>"That condition imposes itself, since I have no official standing."</p>

  <p>"Understood. Do you mind telling me how matters stand at the moment as
  regards the quarrel between His Highness and the priests?"</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj chuckled, visibly relieved. "Why shouldn't I tell?" he
  answered. "It's no secret. They insist on his building a temple, and he has
  no money. They insist he purify himself by an expensive ritual. He will
  not."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Smith asked. "Is his personal ease so important to him that he
  can't concede a bit to superstition? Church and State must hold together,
  dammit,&mdash;or we'll all be Gandhi-ized. The next thing will be Communism.
  Nobody requires His Highness to believe in gods that were thought good enough
  for his ancestors. But he might at least pretend a bit. How else, in these
  difficult times, are we going to preserve our sacred institutions? How shall
  aristocracy survive in the face of Communism, if the Native Princes don't
  stand with the Church? Do you recall what James the First of England said?
  'No bishop, no king!' Tell that to His Highness."</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj placed the tips of his fingers together, as he had seen the
  English lawyers do in consultation. He imagined it impressed the English. He
  particularly wanted to impress Smith, not that he admired or trusted him, but
  he admired and trusted his present royal patron even less. It might be time
  to consider safety. British practice, which is frequently above-board, is
  invariably based, at least politically, on careful underground
  investigation&mdash;spy-work, to put it bluntly. Why had Chullunder Ghose
  been sent by the C.I.D. to snoop and listen? Smith, as Resident, was the
  unacknowledged but none-the-less actual&mdash;even if duly
  incompetent&mdash;link in that part of the world between spies and their
  secretive but immensely powerful masters&mdash;men with misleading titles,
  who can make or ruin any one by hinting at the existence of mysterious,
  anonymous reports. Syed-Suraj hoped to have his own name inscribed on the
  list of desirables. But he was shrewd enough to know that to betray his
  present patron unadroitly would be to destroy his own chances. Treachery, if
  it is to succeed among gentlemen, has to be cloaked in decency and faithful
  phrases.</p>

  <p>"It occurs to me," he said, "that this might be your opportunity to crown
  your career with a ribbon."</p>

  <p>"Pah!" Smith's scorn of decorations was proportioned to the probabilities.
  "My dear fellow, I have never let such considerations influence me for a
  moment."</p>

  <p>He believed that, perhaps. But Syed-Suraj did not. "Even governments,"
  said Syed-Suraj, "now and then are grateful. Many of us who have experienced
  your tact and kindliness would dearly love to see you receive some official
  recognition before you retire."</p>

  <p>"Tut-tut&mdash;let us talk of more important matters."</p>

  <p>"The forced abdication of the Maharajah of Indore," said Syed-Suraj,
  coming promptly to the point, "undoubtedly has strengthened British influence
  in some ways. It has drawn attention to the fact that the British-Indian
  Government can, when it pleases, discipline&mdash;by removal&mdash;any Rajah
  who ignores what we might call the rules of the game."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Yes." Smith shifted nervously. The conversation was getting a bit
  too serious to suit him. Even minor issues, such as tigers, were a nuisance;
  major ones were anathema. However, he had started it; he had to listen.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand," said Syed-Suraj, "it has called attention to
  the&mdash;let us say, vulnerability, of our ruling Princes. There is a
  feeling that a Prince no longer has the unconditional&mdash;and, shall I call
  it, ingenuous backing?&mdash;of the British Raj. A Prince has become, to some
  extent, a skittle, one might say, who can be knocked down by a wave of
  indignation."</p>

  <p>"That is an extreme view&mdash;too suggestive of hysteria," Smith
  answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah! But we must consider local prejudices, politics and misconceptions.
  It is not on facts, but on their interpretation that rebellions are
  based."</p>

  <p>"Rebellions?" said Smith. He looked scandalized.</p>

  <p>"Revolutions, if you prefer the word. The priests have always exercised
  enormous influence in this State. They resent the present ruler's rather
  careless&mdash;and frequently, I may say, stupid&mdash;efforts to destroy
  that influence. They foresee&mdash;or they think they do&mdash;that the
  democratization of India, aimed at by Gandhi and rapidly gathering headway,
  must produce a conflict between new and old ideas. In plain words, they
  believe they must fight to the death for their privileges, sooner or later.
  They appreciate that phrase you wisely quoted just now&mdash;'no bishop, no
  king.' They would, however, say, 'no king, no bishop.' Therefore, they feel
  that the reigning Rajah, in order to preserve the established order, must
  make common cause with them and uphold their dignity and influence, that
  they, in turn, may uphold his. Our mutual friend, my patron, will not see
  that."</p>

  <p>"Damn him!" Smith said fervently.</p>

  <p>"The priests, in consequence, would vastly rather see his cousin on the
  throne. The cousin, as undoubtedly you know, is a religious man, untainted by
  vice or cynicism, and remarkably attentive to the drift of world affairs. He
  is also wealthy in his own right. I know him well. A very honorable man.
  Perhaps a trifle over-altruistic, but sufficiently shrewd to live over the
  border, in British-India, where he can keep in touch with
  his&mdash;ah&mdash;his admirers in the State, but be more or less safe
  from&mdash;ah&mdash;well, you know what so often happens to the
  heirs-apparent to a throne."</p>

  <p>Smith scowled. That was another unpleasant subject. It was notorious that
  for hundreds of years those few direct heirs to the throne of Kutchdullub who
  had not been murdered had survived by luck or accident, or through the
  watchfulness of faithful servants.</p>

  <p>"Let us hope that British example has relegated that sort of thing to the
  dishonored past, Syed-Suraj."</p>

  <p>"Yes, let us hope so. Hope is wholesome. The point is, the cousin is
  sick&mdash;very sick. He is said to have ulcers. Rather rashly&mdash;in my
  opinion&mdash;he is just now visiting a little place he owns up in the
  mountains in this State."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that. He paid me a call on the way," Smith answered.</p>

  <p>"He was taken worse there."</p>

  <p>"You suspect&mdash;?" Smith almost used undiplomatic language. Syed-Suraj
  diplomatically did not notice it.</p>

  <p>"The priests&mdash;the High Church party, that is&mdash;are afraid he may
  die and be lost to their cause. They believe, whether rightly or wrongly,
  that medical&mdash;possibly surgical&mdash;skill might save him. And they
  don't trust the man from Madras who has charge of the case."</p>

  <p>"Too bad the Residency doctor went on leave," said Smith.</p>

  <p>"Yes, altogether too bad. In the circumstances it is only natural the High
  Church party should be restless. They are in a position to put the screws on.
  They intend to do it, in order, if possible, to save the life of the heir to
  the throne. They want him on it, and they mean to get him there by hook or by
  crook."</p>

  <p>"Ridiculous!" said Smith. "Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"The trouble with impossibilities," Syed-Suraj answered, "is that they so
  often happen. The High Church party has been most ingenious. They have a
  tiger that is killing people. And they have a story that exactly fits the
  superstitious prejudices of the peasants, while it tickles the sense of humor
  of more intelligent people."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've heard that tiger story. Something must be done about it."</p>

  <p>"What, though? From time immemorial it has been the Rajah's privilege, in
  person or by deputy, to shoot all tigers that molest the people. If he shoots
  that tiger he will find himself denounced for having violated the ancient
  sanctuary where a so-called priestess keeps the brute. How she keeps him
  there, I don't know, but she does it. And remember that the Rajah, from the
  High Church viewpoint, is in a state of gross impurity that he refuses to
  correct by proper ritual and sacrifice. It would be a scandalous act for him
  to cross the threshold, even of a sacred ruin, no matter for what reason.
  They could make an awful stink about it."</p>

  <p>"There would be riots. He might get killed&mdash;that's almost probable,
  there are so many fanatics who have been stirred up by the propaganda."</p>

  <p>"Whose propaganda? The priests?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. They are masters of it. And what will happen if he does not
  shoot the tiger? They will say not only that he neglects his duty, but that
  the tiger is sent as a curse from the angry gods because he broke his promise
  to rebuild that ruin in the jungle. And he can't rebuild it, even if he cared
  to, since he has no money. Consequence&mdash;even worse rioting!"</p>

  <p>"Dammit, perhaps I'd better go and shoot that brute myself," said
  Smith.</p>

  <p>"But if you do, my friend, you will end your career in a hornets' nest
  instead of being decorated for discretion!"</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It occurred to me that possibly you
  might&mdash;ah&mdash;let us say, intuitively,
  guess&mdash;the&mdash;ah&mdash;the British attitude toward the Rajah's
  cousin. If he should come to the throne, why then, of course, the priests
  would get rid of the tiger. They'd poison the brute."</p>

  <p>Smith was horrified. He was as capable of treachery as any other
  nerveless, self-important bureaucrat; but minor treachery&mdash;nothing
  heroic&mdash;nothing that might involve him in a nine-day tempest in a teapot
  at the close of his career. He had a genius for minor treachery. Already he
  was shaping in his mind a full report of this strictly private conversation,
  to be sent to Delhi, where it would do Syed-Suraj no good. But now he thought
  of something better. He could kill two birds with one stone, and retain his
  own reputation for tact.</p>

  <p>"It's as simple as most problems are when you face them," he answered. "I
  can see no reason to take official cognizance of this. But take my
  compliments to His Highness, and suggest to him that he should send that
  fellow Hawkes to shoot the tiger. I am told he is an excellent shot."</p>

  <p>"But sacrilege&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, certainly. He can blame Hawkes, and dismiss him&mdash;pack him off
  home to England. Hawkes was in here not two hours ago. I had to reprimand him
  for trying to interfere in what was none of his business. I can testify that
  Hawkes is an incorrigible meddler."</p>

  <p>"Hawkes has a contract&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He can be dismissed for cause," Smith answered. "Use tact. Warn His
  Highness to be careful how he instructs Hawkes. That's all."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">CHAPTER 7</a><br>
  "You should have been the Unknown Soldier"</h2>

  <p class="first">FROM the British Residency, where a Union Jack drooped
  dismally on a pole from which sun and rain had flaked most of the paint, to
  the Rajah's palace, where damp-chilled and disgusted sepoys stood on guard
  before the pretentious iron gate, was a mile and a half. There was an avenue
  of trees, then winding, cobbled streets&mdash;a maze of narrow-fronted,
  mostly two-storied houses with flat roofs, built around tiny courtyards in
  which the hot-weather life of the city was lived. But during the monsoon most
  of the life was indoors, where it grew shrill and
  irritable&mdash;over-crowded.</p>

  <p>At about the time when Louis XIV was inviting bankruptcy by building
  palaces to house his ignorance of economics, a Frenchman of curious
  character, possessing an amazing gift of salesmanship, had inspired the
  despot who then occupied the throne of Kutchdullub with ambition to rebuild
  the city. Nothing sanitary&mdash;such indecencies had not been thought
  of&mdash;but as grandiose and gimcrack as a stack of exposition buildings.
  Naturally, the job was never finished; tax-exasperated merchants had the
  Rajah poisoned, and the Frenchman was chased off the roof of the house he had
  built for himself; the city dogs ate what was left of him. The houses had
  come to their natural end and had been replaced by indigenous Indian
  architecture. But the squares remained, and the trees still graced them. So
  the center of the city was a spaciously conceived oasis of four paved
  quadrangles. One faced the palace; another the temple of Kali; the third was
  mainly occupied by shops belonging to the more successful merchants; and the
  fourth square was a marketplace. Normally the latter hummed with chaffering
  and stank of cabbage, onions, and spice; but in the monsoon it was a waste of
  bluish-gray cement on which sheets of rain rippled. Around three sides of
  that was a stucco colonnade, beneath which were the shops &mdash;
  half-shuttered now to keep the draught out&mdash;of the dealers in corn,
  enamel-ware; and all the cheap stuff that peasants delight in. There, also,
  was the store of Ram Dass, dealer in mortgages, money, and grain. It had
  yellow-painted shutters. It occupied eight whole arches of the colonnade.</p>

  <p>Wheeled traffic was not allowed in that square, and the prohibition was
  enforced by steps and a row of ancient iron cannons set three feet apart with
  their muzzles downward, along the side of the square that opened to the main
  street. So even Rajahs had to walk if they should wish to visit Ram Dass, and
  a Rajah's confidential dick-o'dirty-work was under the same necessity.
  Syed-Suraj had to leave the Rajah's silver-plated Rolls-Royce standing in the
  street and mince amid the puddles under a big umbrella held for him by the
  liveried footman. He hated, as much as a cat, to get his little feet wet. And
  he hated to wait in the draughty shop. But Ram Dass kept him waiting &mdash;
  sent out word that he was being treated for lumbago by a doctor and could not
  come until the torture was over.</p>

  <p>Ram Dass was a comfortably fat, gray-bearded veteran with twinkling eyes,
  who no more had lumbago than he had melancholia. There was nothing whatever
  wrong with him, or with his bank account. Voluminously clothed in clean,
  white cotton and the little round cap of a bunnia,* he sat cross-legged on a
  pile of corn-sacks, with a kerosene stove beside him, on which a kettle sang
  cheerfully. In front of him, on an up-turned, empty box, there was a teapot,
  sugar, cream, two teacups, and a silver case of cigarettes. Beyond that
  wholly satisfactory and swankless table, on another pile of corn-sacks,
  equally contented, sat Chullunder Ghose. He was enormously bulky, but there
  was something about him&mdash;it might be his sense of humor&mdash;that
  suggested they were two of a kind.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>bunnia, bunya, baniya, baniah, banyan</i> (Hindi
  from Sanskrit "vanij", a merchant)&mdash;a (grain) merchant; also: a
  money-lender; sometimes used to denote a Hindu is general. For details, see
  the article <a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:142.hobson">Banyan</a>
  in <i>The Hobson Jobson Dictionary</i>. ]</p>

  <p>"If they think you are dead," said Ram Dass, "they will presently unthink
  it. You are about as easy to disguise as an elephant. Someone must have seen
  you enter my shop. You are well known. And as soon as the Rajah learns about
  his bully lying dead in the rain he will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, he won't," said Chullunder Ghose. "He knows I could appeal to the
  Resident if he should have me arrested. Even if he locked me in a secret
  place, he would know that you or someone else could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Could avenge your death. What good would that do? He would swear that you
  had died by an accident and bring a hundred witnesses to prove it. Then
  what?"</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose smiled and sipped tea. Then he helped himself to an
  expensive cigarette. "The god of accidents," he remarked, and blew the sweet
  smoke through his nose, "is a respecter of persons. Self am favorite. You
  ascertain the odds as soon as possible, and bet on this babu."</p>

  <p>"I never bet."</p>

  <p>"No? Why, then, did you lend His Highness, yesterday, ten thousand rupees,
  as you say you did?"</p>

  <p>"Only five thousand. I took his note for ten."</p>

  <p>"What is that but betting&mdash;on a, weak quail?"</p>

  <p>"I agreed to lend another five&mdash;same terms, same interest &mdash;
  provided I receive the contract to supply grain for the elephants for five
  years. That is why Syed-Suraj waits outside there. He has brought the
  contract. He has come for the money."</p>

  <p>"You believe, then, that the Rajah will continue on the throne as much as
  five weeks?" asked Chullunder Ghose. "For a man of affairs you are
  credulous&mdash;credulous. Pour me more tea."</p>

  <p>"We could do without him," Ram Dass answered, pouring. "But they tell me
  his cousin is dying&mdash;poison, no doubt. So who shall succeed him? The
  British always shut their eyes and ears unless they see a way clear; and the
  whole world knows they have trouble enough with Gandhi and the Nationalists,
  and the Round Table Conference, and unemployment, and God knows what else.
  They certainly don't want to have to add this State to British India. The
  nervous old wreck at the Residency, who would have hysterics if he were
  called on to act with determination, is sufficient proof to me that the
  British don't mean to be drastic."</p>

  <p>"Any rioting yet?" asked Chullunder Ghose.</p>

  <p>"No, none yet. This is bad weather for rioting. There will be some,
  though, unless someone kills that tiger. Priests are just as stupid as
  Princes; they have overdone it this time, and they don't know how to back
  down. As if the Rajah would care that their tiger eats a hundred people! That
  will only react on the priests when people wake up. Then what?"</p>

  <p>"Let us interview the jackal."</p>

  <p>"Bring him in here?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? But why lend money?"</p>

  <p>"I want that contract."</p>

  <p>"Have it. But save five thousand rupees. Hawkesey never takes commissions.
  Offer Hawkesey good grain at a fair price, promise him you'll not cheat, and
  ask him to get you such a contract next month. Hawkesey is on the
  establishment. A change on the throne would make no difference to Hawkesey's
  job. He loves those elephants. Moldy corn delivered to the elephants would
  make Hawkesey your enemy. I think I would prefer the tiger&mdash;or myself. I
  also am a sentimental adversary. <i>Verb. sap.</i>"</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj was admitted: A discreet clerk bore a chair in front of him and
  set it where the light would fall straight on its occupant's face. That act
  of courtesy made it perfectly clear to Syed-Suraj that he was not being
  received as an equal. The democracy of corn-sacks was denied to him; he was a
  mere ambassador from a throne, looked upon from the corn-sacks with contempt.
  It amused him, or at any rate he tried to think it did.</p>

  <p>"I forgive you the lumbago on condition that I need not drink tea," he
  remarked. Then he faced Chullunder Ghose. "You certainly surprise me. Where
  are you from?"</p>

  <p>The babu winked at him. "I surprised myself. Question is, what will His
  Highness do with <i>corpus delicti</i>? Is it found yet?"</p>

  <p>"Oho! So you killed a man?"</p>

  <p>"I?" said the babu. "Telling you things is a lot too dangerous; you have
  brains. For instance, I would not dream of hinting to you that a wise rat
  leaves a rotten ship."</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj produced one of his own cigarettes and lighted it, cupping his
  hands around the match to hide his face a moment while he controlled its
  expression. Then he turned to Ram Dass:</p>

  <p>"Do I get that money?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>"I have brought the contract."</p>

  <p>"Tear it up," said Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj stared from face to face. Chullunder Ghose spoke swiftly before
  Ram Dass could put in another word:</p>

  <p>"You know something, don't you? Why not tell us?"</p>

  <p>"I have no news. I was at the Residency. Smith was as usual &mdash;
  futile."</p>

  <p>"Did you fall or were you pushed?" the babu asked him. "I mean, were you
  sent or sent for?"</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj dropped the cigarette and set his heel on it. He laid his hands
  on his knees and faced the babu. He grinned like a cat.</p>

  <p>"If you want information," he retorted, "you will have to play fair. Is
  the net out for me too?"</p>

  <p>"No," the babu answered.</p>

  <p>"But the C.I.D.?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard of that. What is it?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"Cursed Inquisitive Dog Department," Syed-Suraj answered. "If you won't
  play fair, damn you!"</p>

  <p>"All right, I shall have to ask Smith what you talked about and, if he
  does not tell me, I can tell him! You were either sent or summoned. What is
  there for him and you to talk about but His Highness, the priests and a
  tiger? Did he send for you to talk about the weather?"</p>

  <p>"I believe you have already talked with Smith."</p>

  <p>"Your beliefs are as unimportant to me as the day-before-yesterday's
  dinner that I didn't eat," Chullunder Ghose answered. "I wasn't joking when I
  said I think you have brains. I am giving you a chance to use them."</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj stared a minute at the oil-stove. He looked at Ram Dass, but
  the merchant was stroking a black cat that had laid a dead mouse on the sacks
  beside him.</p>

  <p>"Clever pussy! Fool mouse ran the wrong way, did he?" Ram Dass tossed the
  mouse into a corner and the cat leapt after it.</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj drew a folded contract from his inner pocket, crackled it to
  attract attention, and then tore it to pieces. "A nod," he remarked, "is as
  good as a wink. Let us exchange confidences."</p>

  <p>He was interrupted. A turbaned clerk came in to announce that Hawkes sahib
  wished to speak to Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>"Ask him to be good enough to wait. Be sure to give him a cigar."</p>

  <p>The clerk went out again and Syed-Suraj assumed a rather bored expression.
  He had evidently thought of a bright idea; he wished to hide its newness; he
  was conscious that the bright, mild eyes of Chullunder Ghose were studying
  him&mdash;smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was, as you say, about the tiger," he began. "I went for a quite
  informal conversation, but Smith seemed worried about the Rajah's
  difficulties. One thing led to another until we got pretty deep into local
  politics, and at last he asked me my opinion. So I gave it. I suggested he
  should shoot the tiger. He objected, so I offered an alternative. I told him
  to ask Hawkes to do it. That ought to solve the problem. Hawkes can be the
  scapegoat afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Does Smith pay Hawkes?" asked Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>"No. The State of Kutchdullub pays Hawkes. Smith saw that point. You got
  Hawkes his job, Chullunder Ghose; so I suggest that you should tell Hawkes to
  go after the tiger. Hawkes would listen to you. You would get the credit with
  the C.I.D. for having pulled a trigger that saved a nasty situation."</p>

  <p>"And a nice, kind Rajah! No," the babu answered, "we will let you have the
  credit. You may need it. You tell Hawkesey."</p>

  <p>"If I do, and if he speaks to you about it, will you put a word in?"</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose stretched his naked feet toward the stove to warm
  them.</p>

  <p>"Why not? The suggestion, though, should come from you in the first
  instance, not me. I will add my influence."</p>

  <p>"Then I will tell him now," said Syed-Suraj. "May I count on you also to
  mention my name in the proper quarter?"</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose nodded. Syed-Suraj bowed with semi-serious respect to
  both men and went out, shutting the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Well, that settles it," said Ram Dass. "You have saved a situation, as he
  calls it. But you have also saved a monster on a throne that he defiles every
  day of the week. You have probably condemned the Rajah's cousin to a painful
  death by poison. You have certainly sacrificed Hawkes&mdash;and that means
  you have cost me a contract. I don't think you are so clever."</p>

  <p>"Clever?" said the babu. "I am treacherous. And I believe in devils. I
  believe I know them when I see them. Don't keep Hawkesey too long."</p>

  <p>Ram Dass, contract still in mind, went out to do the honors. Five minutes
  later he himself led Hawkes in. Hawkes looked curiously like a London Bobby
  with his long black waterproof and the hood drawn up over his head. He was
  wholesome. As he pushed the hood back and his eyes grew used to the gloom
  amid piled-up corn-sacks, he stared&mdash;grinned&mdash;held out his
  hand:</p>

  <p>"You, you damned old son-of-a-gun! Say, when did you blow in? And why not
  my house? Damn&mdash;I'd sooner see you than a pay-raise! Remember last time
  you and I got drunk together? It's about time for an encore."</p>

  <p>"Drunk since?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"Hell, no! You're the only one I drink with. I could pass for a teetotaler
  if you weren't living."</p>

  <p>"What is new?" the babu asked him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Same old round of checking up and finding fault. Yes, there is,
  though&mdash;damn, the sight o' you 'ud make a man forget his mother. Have
  you heard o' the tiger that's killing and eating 'em, over beyond the
  river?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen that tiger," said the babu. "I have come from there. I saw it
  kill a man."</p>

  <p>"Trust you to know everything! Smith as good as called me a liar today for
  reporting it. Was that fellow Syed-Suraj in here? Do you trust him? He
  button-holed me as he went out, said he had the Rajah's orders to instruct me
  to go after the brute tomorrow morning. Do you think that's on the
  level?"</p>

  <p>"On about three levels," said the babu. "What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"Me? I asked for it in writing."</p>

  <p>"Hawkesey, you are much too sane to do me any credit! You should have been
  the Unknown Soldier! Take an elephant and start tomorrow morning.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that?"</p>

  <p>"But you must not shoot the tiger!"</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>"You must find out for me how they keep a tiger in a ruined temple and
  persuade it to return when it has finished hunting. When you have found that
  out, you must come back and tell me."</p>

  <p>"You've the call on me," said Hawkes. "I can't say no to you. You know
  that."</p>

  <p>"Some men can forget more easily than you do, Hawkesey. Can you manage to
  get word to Syed-Suraj? Ask to see him. Say you didn't understand him. Ask
  him to repeat the conversation. Then agree to start tomorrow. And then do it.
  But as one friend to another, kindly&mdash;please&mdash;don't kill the tiger,
  even if he bites you! I require him."</p>

  <p>"Alive?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and gnashful! Teeth, tail, talons and a nasty disposition!"</p>

  <p>"Won't you tell me what the game is?"</p>

  <p>"Hawkesey, I would tell you anything, if only you weren't honest! Wait
  until afterwards. But bring back word and tell me all that happens."</p>

  <p>"O.K., since it's you, old trusty."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER 8</a><br>
  "It happened thiswise, sahibs"</h2>

  <p class="first">THE head mahout was angrier than even the monsoon weather
  justified.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand devils take that Haw-kiss-ee! Now he gets up in darkness to
  punish the sun if it rises late! See him look at his watch that he doubtless
  stole from someone! Hurry-hurry-hurry!"</p>

  <p>It was a presentation watch; it had been given to Hawkes by a grateful
  general as a reward for inventing a wonderful trick for teaching raw recruits
  to shoot straight. He had saved his country millions of pounds and nobody
  could ever guess how many lives, but he rightly considered the watch a more
  than ample compensation. It was a chronometer watch. It had been made by
  scientists. Hawkes had a touching and abiding faith in science.</p>

  <p>That was half the secret of his friendship with Chullunder Ghose. He knew
  the babu could talk nine languages and think in terms of quantum; drunk or
  sober, he could quote Kant, Einstein, the Mahabharata, Shakespeare, and Plato
  with equal humorous familiarity. So the babu was on a pedestal in Hawkes's
  mind. But there were other reasons; the babu was a genuine friend in need,
  with secret influence that he had earned by merit. It was the babu who had
  wangled him the job that saved him from the dreaded half-existence on a
  color-sergeant's pension back in England and enabled him to keep his sisters
  off the dole.</p>

  <p>So whatever the babu said or did was scientific, straight, dependable, in
  Hawkes's opinion, to be betted on&mdash;blind, if need be&mdash;and
  unquestionably on the level. There were no reserves in Hawkes's mind; he had
  tested the babu and judged that he could trust him. Dynamite might modify
  Hawkes's judgment by destroying Hawkes, but he was otherwise as changeless as
  the honest flavor of an onion or as the habit of water to run downhill; which
  was why the babu liked him. And Hawkes started on an elephant at daybreak,
  having talked the evening before with Syed-Suraj as requested, because Hawkes
  invariably kept a promise.</p>

  <p>He was curious, but not offended, to discover that a sly-eyed villager
  from beyond the river wished to ride with him. The fellow had a big new knife
  in an embossed sheath and was inordinately proud of it. He also had a
  <i>chiteh</i>* from the babu&mdash;just a scrap of paper, with the words:
  "Please take him. C.G."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>chiteh, chit, chitti</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a note, a
  short letter. <a href=

  The Hobson Jobson Dictionary</i></a>. ]</p>

  <p>"Up you get," said Hawkes, "you naked golliwog; you'll need a blanket.
  Here, take this one. You may keep it."</p>

  <p>It had been a good one in its day. It was an <i>ante bellum</i> blanket,
  big and beautifully criss-crossed by a German-Jew designer's notion of a
  Highland tartan. It was a bit ragged, but the hole in the middle would do to
  stick a fellow's head through. It established in the mind of the villager the
  opinion that Hawkes was a wealthy and profligate man, from whom important
  favors might be coaxed if he were suitably managed. The question being how to
  manage him, he sat silent at the rear of the howdah, on the left-hand side,
  remembering all the tales he had ever heard about a white man's blind
  obedience to unknown laws. He naturally got them badly mixed up; it seldom
  happens that a naked plowman from a mud-and-wattle village by a jungle
  understands an Englishman, however hard he tries to. But he can try.</p>

  <p>The elephant squelched through the mud and enjoyed it. The howdah
  bellyband, his belly, and his legs, became a slimy, comfortable mess that did
  not dry and cake off, since the rain, that had lessened a bit and had warmed
  since yesterday, streamed down his sides in rivulets and kept the paste thin.
  The mahout was miserable, since he had to face the rain; but he did not dare
  to vent his temper on the animal, because he knew Hawkes's strange objection
  to the habit; and he also knew that Hawkes had whisky with him. Liking
  whisky, he proposed to be rewarded with a tot for good behavior. And the
  elephant, who also liked it, knew that Hawkes invariably spared some, to be
  poured on the enormous loaf of corn-meal that formed part of the load in the
  howdah. So it was best foot first, to reach dinner as soon as might be, and
  in spite of the rain and the hurrying clouds there was nobody feeling that
  life did not have compensations. Hawkes smoked, with a hand over his pipe to
  keep the rain from drowning the tobacco.</p>

  <p>On the left was jungle, on the right an endless waste of water reaching to
  the sky-line, that would presently be plowed fields when the flood subsided.
  Far ahead were mountains curtained by pearly mist that sometimes, when the
  wind grew squally, let the sun through and presented sudden vistas of
  green-and-gold forested ranges. There was not a human to be seen until the
  villager grunted to call Hawkes's attention, and Hawkes saw four men in the
  khaki uniform of State constabulary, staggering along through nearly
  knee-deep mud towards them.</p>

  <p>They were carrying something. It was a litter made of poles and twigs. A
  man lay on it, who was not in uniform. They set down the litter and waited
  for the elephant, and as it drew near two of the men walked out into the
  road&mdash;looking determined&mdash;pulling down their tunics and squaring
  their shoulders to show authority.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" one of them commanded. "Here we have a corpse. It must be taken to
  Kutchdullub."</p>

  <p>"Do you mistake me for an undertaker?" Hawkes asked. There was neither
  love nor admiration lost between him and the State constabulary. He regarded
  them as blackmailing bullies, in league with criminals, and eager to be
  bribed by anyone. They sullenly resented him as an alien who had no right to
  criticize them, but who did it bluntly and without that tolerance that men
  who drew the Rajah's pay should feel for one another.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"One of us. He was on plain-clothes duty. We were on patrol and found him
  lying near here, raving with a cracked skull."</p>

  <p>"Could he talk sense?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"Not until shortly before he died. Then he spoke of a cart. But if there
  was one, then the rain has washed away the marks of it. And he spoke of a man
  in the dark, who struck him as they stood together talking near the
  cart-tail."</p>

  <p>From the howdah Hawkes stared at the muddied corpse on the litter beside
  the road. He observed an empty holster.</p>

  <p>"Where is his revolver?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Missing. Whoever struck him, took it."</p>

  <p>"What did the assailant look like? Did he tell you?"</p>

  <p>"No; he said he couldn't see him in the darkness. He could only say a few
  words. Then he grew delirious again and soon died."</p>

  <p>"Was he on patrol too? Why was he alone? You plunderers always hunt in
  couples, when there aren't a dozen of you. What was he doing?"</p>

  <p>"Secret duty."</p>

  <p>"Dirty work, eh? Why are you patrolling?"</p>

  <p>"We were looking for him."</p>

  <p>"That so? You expected trouble, did you?"</p>

  <p>Silence. Surly glances from the four men, then a sour grin from the
  spokesman. Hawkes stared at the litter again.</p>

  <p>"What have you underneath that sacking?" He could see the edge of a
  shovel. "You look like a burial party to me."</p>

  <p>The villager in the howdah interrupted:</p>

  <p>"It was a priest who did it," he said suddenly in Hawkes's ear.</p>

  <p>One of the policemen overheard him. "Come down here, you!"</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are," Hawkes ordered. "Tell your story."</p>

  <p>Fame! A pulpit! Oratory from a Rajah's elephant! Police for audience! A
  friend, not only reckless with expensive blankets, but not even scared of the
  Rajah's "constabeels." Ecstasy! Also a vision of favors to come!</p>

  <p>"It happened thiswise, sahibs. Having lost my old knife, I must get a new
  one. Therefore I swam the river and set forth on foot to Kutchdullub. There
  rode a priest in a cart, and I sought to overtake the cart, being minded to
  ask the favor of a ride into the city, as was not unreasonable. Many a time
  that priest has drunk our cow-milk at the village, it being he who brings the
  he-goats for the temple sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"What temple?"</p>

  <p>"That one that lies in ruins in the jungle."</p>

  <p>"Sacrifices?"</p>

  <p>"Once a week that priest brings seven goats, all he-ones. There is a daily
  sacrifice. However, we of the village offer no goats, since a tiger slays too
  many of them, so we told the priests to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The constable swore impatiently to keep the story within limits.</p>

  <p>"Tell what happened."</p>

  <p>"Thus it happened. As I overtook the cart&mdash;it labored in the deep
  mud, sahibs&mdash;that one, he who lies dead, came forth from the jungle
  suddenly. He did not see me, but I saw him. And I feared him. So I crouched
  in darkness. I heard him say he would ride in the cart. But the priest said
  nay to that. For they are thrice-born swaggerers, those priests. They fear a
  man's touch, notwithstanding that the Lord Mahatma Gandhi teaches&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To the lowest hell with Gandhi! Tell what happened."</p>

  <p>"But I do tell. He began to climb into the cart, holding his revolver
  thus. But the priest had a light&mdash;a peculiar one, like a stick, that he
  flashed into the man's face. By that light I saw the priest's hand hold a
  club and strike the man twice on the top of the head. So he fell. And he
  dropped his revolver. So the priest got down and, groping for it, found it.
  He flung it away. I heard it fall into a pool of water. Then the priest
  returned into the cart. I heard him command the driver to go forward. And,
  being frightened, I ran. The cart was heavy and the mud deep. Therefore I
  reached Kutchdullub far ahead of it. I bought my new knife. And because I
  enjoy the special favor of the Ruler of the Land, I now return home on a
  royal elephant."</p>

  <p>"Get off the elephant before I drag you down," the policeman commanded.
  "You may tell that story, or another version of it, at the <i>kana</i>."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>kana</i>&mdash;police-station. Annotator]</p>

  <p>But the villager appealed to Hawkes in silence, eloquent in gesture.
  Hawkes knew as well as the villager did what tortures they would give him in
  a dark cell to induce him to tell a lot more than he knew, and to edit his
  story to suit police convenience. It was not his business, but he had
  Chullunder Ghose's note; he felt he might be letting down the babu somehow if
  he failed to interfere now.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell," he answered. "I'm in charge o' this man. Two of you had
  better hunt for that revolver that he says the priest threw away. If you find
  it, it'll be evidence. One of you stand by the corpse, and let the fourth man
  hurry to Kutchdullub for assistance."</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay! That is the Rajah's elephant. We will ride home on it."</p>

  <p>"That so?&mdash;<i>Cheloh!</i>" Hawkes commanded. The mahout knew better
  than to disobey Hawkes. The elephant resumed his squelching progress through
  the mud. Rain came down again in torrents. Hawkes sat silent, with his coat
  up to his ears until the squall ceased. Then he turned his head abruptly.</p>

  <p>"You're a liar," he said to the villager. "Why did you tell that mess of
  lies? If it was true, you'd have held your tongue about it for fear of being
  held as a witness."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I spoke truth."</p>

  <p>"Get down and walk then. Swing yourself down by the elephant's tail and go
  with the policemen!"</p>

  <p>"Is the sahib angry that the priests should eat a little trouble? They
  have made enough of it for other people. They have said their tiger only
  slays the wicked. So our village has become a by-word, and other men mock us
  to our faces. Nobody will slay that tiger for us, and the priests
  say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cut it short now. Who did kill the police spy?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I know not."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you invented all that yarn? Then down you get and go back.
  You're too big a liar to ride on a decent elephant."</p>

  <p>"But is the sahib not the friend of him who sent me with the
  <i>chiteh</i>? And if the sahib's friend should be accused of slaying some
  one, would the sahib like that?"</p>

  <p>Hawkes stared.</p>

  <p>"I am a poor man," said the villager. "I thought if I should save the
  sahib's friend from accusation, then the sahib possibly might give this
  humble person a reward."</p>

  <p>Hawkes continued to stare. "Did you see the man killed?" he demanded. "Did
  you see who did it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but no matter. I have turned the blame on to those bloody-minded
  Brahmins.* If the sahib should give me fifty rupees, I could hide among the
  mountains until it is time to plow. And for a hundred I could stay away all
  summer."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Brahmin</i>&mdash;a member of the highest of the
  Hindu <i>varnas</i> (castes)&mdash;that of priests and teachers. The word is
  related to, but not to be confused with, the Hindu religious conception of

  information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin">Brahmin</a>. ]</p>

  <p>Hawkes spat. "Not a rupee."</p>

  <p>"But the sahib has an old coat. It is tied in the roll of bedding that is
  under the tarpaulin."</p>

  <p>"You stay by me," Hawkes retorted. "If I get a good report about you from
  the babu you shall have what's right."</p>

  <p>"But if he lies about me? All babus are liars."</p>

  <p>Hawkes stuck his pipe in his teeth, carefully lighted it, puffed a few
  times and then leaned back against the bedding roll.</p>

  <p>"If you think that about him, hook it," he suggested. "The elephant keeps
  his tail at that end. Use it. I'll look straight ahead until we're past that
  big tree on the left hand."</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay," said the villager. "That babu said I am to ride free all the
  way to the village."</p>

  <p>Hawkes stuck his hands in his overcoat pockets and whistled softly to
  himself. The villager did not like that, because it is well known that to
  whistle softly summons evil spirits; so he hummed a little nasal mantra said
  to disagree with evil spirits, and sat meditating&mdash;wondering why sahibs
  are so complicated and unable to discern the simplest way of solving
  riddles.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">CHAPTER 9</a><br>
  "Talk with one another"</h2>

  <p class="first">CRISES on which destinies appear to hinge are sometimes
  unimportant, being actually no more than the din of aftermath. The genuinely
  change-producing undercurrents escape attention, they are so deep and
  devious. But they meet. They create a vortex. Then the deluge. And they who
  are caught in the deluge rarely ever know exactly how and why it happens.</p>

  <p>The Rajah was a man who did not see deep, although he thought himself
  almost a Machiavelli. He had plenty of spies; but all of them, except
  Syed-Suraj, had learned to tell him what they guessed he wished to believe;
  he had a way of striking off the pay-roll anyone who told unpalatable truths
  too often. And he read the papers, even though they bored him; so he
  flattered himself that he thoroughly understood the trend of world
  affairs.</p>

  <p><i>"Tu m'embêtes!"</i> he remarked to Syed-Suraj in the library. "A bat
  could tell you there's a revolution going on all over the world. It's
  economic, it's religious, it's scientific, and it's social. It will end in
  the break-up of empires&mdash;as happened to Rome, and to our Moghuls, and to
  Napoleon's half-finished scheme. And then what? The survival of the fittest!
  Princes who are not such asses as to give a damn what other people think,
  will come into their own again. Pour me a brandy-and-soda. India, within a
  year or two, will be a welter of what that idiot Wilson preached as
  self-determination&mdash;take my word for it&mdash;each State for itself, to
  hell with all the others, and the English, thank God, stewing in their own
  grease on an island in the North Sea. All I need is to prevent the priests
  from getting too much power. Just now I'm letting them go too far, on
  purpose. Later, when the crash comes, I won't need them; they will need me.
  Have a drink too? Why not?"</p>

  <p>"It will need a clear head to&mdash;ah&mdash;to follow your line of
  thought," said Syed-Suraj. "I am not a statesman. But I run your errands.
  Wouldn't it be safer if you took me into confidence?"</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>"What have you done, for instance, that I don't know?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except that I've sent a party out to bury that babu. I picked
  four men notorious for criminal associations. They are men who won't
  talk&mdash;won't dare."</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj blinked his bright eyes, hesitated, and then changed the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"Any news of your cousin?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. That doctor of yours from Madras is a slowcoach."</p>

  <p>"He has made a lot of money out of life-insurance cases," said Syed-Suraj,
  "and he understands the dangers of an autopsy. He's a safe man. But have you
  paid him?"</p>

  <p>"Why ask? You know as well as I do that I'm personally broke. I will give
  him a thousand rupees from the five you got from Ram Dass. Then let him
  whistle. He won't dare talk."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid of the priests," said Syed-Suraj. "They are subtle."</p>

  <p>"Are they? They will find themselves out-subtled! Hawkes is on his way to
  shoot their tiger, isn't he? I may have to fire Hawkes for a scapegoat. But
  what of it? There are plenty of Hawkeseys. Every one will understand that the
  tiger trick was rather neatly turned against them. They will be laughed at.
  It will cost them prestige. And what is left after that of their prestige
  will fall in the mud when the news breaks that my beloved cousin can't
  succeed me on the throne for rather concrete reasons! After that, what can
  they do but make their peace with me? No heir! Do they want the British to
  take over the State and run it Gandhi-fashion&mdash;brotherhood with
  Christians, Sikhs and Moslems&mdash;child-marriages unlawful&mdash;caste
  repudiated? Not they! The priests will decide to put up with me! And they
  will pray for a son of my loins to inherit the throne!"</p>

  <p>"It sounds good," said Syed-Suraj. "How about my rake-off, by the way, of
  the loan from Ram Dass?"</p>

  <p>"Get the balance. Then I'll pay you."</p>

  <p>"But he won't lend any more."</p>

  <p>"Try him again, if you want your rake-off, as you call it. Take my car and
  go and see him."</p>

  <p>But Syed-Suraj did not take the Rajah's Rolls-Royce. Neither did he go to
  Ram Dass. He had debts of his own, and a craving&mdash;not to pay his debts
  exactly, but to place a stake to windward where his creditors might whistle
  for it. He was nervous. He felt that the Rajah had gypped him out of a
  commission, and he savagely resented it. He could not go directly to the
  priests, and offer to betray the Rajah to them. They would probably decline
  an interview. But there are ways and ways of doing things.</p>

  <p>There never yet was an important priesthood that did not subsidize a more
  than ultramontane lawyer to direct its contacts with temporal government.
  Ananda Raz was a Brahmin schooled in those arts. He kept an
  inoffensive-looking office in the square where the wealthier merchants had
  their shops, and did a lucrative legal business. Thither walked Syed-Suraj,
  carrying his own umbrella, because, although he hated Brahmins, he knew it
  rarely paid to put on airs in their presence, even if one has adopted Western
  habits and repudiated caste to some extent. One may afford to smile
  sardonically at the very mention of religion, but it is wise not to flourish
  one's offensive affiliations in a land where priests have teeth and competent
  attorneys.</p>

  <p>There was the usual outer office, white-washed, full of meek clerks and
  spidery files; and there was an oil-stove in the midst, because Ananda Raz
  was prosperous and liked to have his clerks half-thawed as well as
  half-starved&mdash;meekly eager, that is, and aware that their employer
  thought about their little comforts. Next, between outer and inner office,
  was a waiting-room without a stove, as dark as a police cell, furnished with
  one plain table and one rigidly plain chair. After a minute or two of
  mysterious conversation through a tube, Syed-Suraj was conducted to the
  waiting-room and left there. He was very interested in the thickness of the
  ancient wood partition between the waiting-room and inner office. It was
  almost a museum piece&mdash;incongruous. He wondered at the richly carved
  panels, and as he examined them, he saw a panel slide the merest fraction of
  an inch. So he sat down and glanced at his watch, a bit disgusted that he
  could not recognize the eye that he could easily see peeping at him through
  the opening. The eye vanished. The panel closed again&mdash;almost. There was
  still a thin crack&mdash;quite unusually careless for a man of Ananda Raz's
  distinguished habits. Syed-Suraj put his ear to the crack. He forgot for the
  moment that his name had been announced through a speaking-tube, so it did
  not occur to him that the crack might have been carefully left to induce him
  to listen.</p>

  <p>Ananda Raz was speaking&mdash;wheezily, squeakily. Even the attorneys of
  the pious now and then have asthma.</p>

  <p>"The priests repudiate all knowledge of the tiger," he said. "If His
  Highness won't keep his promise to rebuild that temple, no one but he is to
  blame if a tiger occupies the ruins and slaughters villagers. If there are
  riots on account of it, he will be answerable for that too. As the legal
  member of the Legislative Council, I shall raise that issue at the very next
  session, no matter how many members he thinks he has under his thumb, and no
  matter how many threats are aimed at me. And I assure you"&mdash;he began to
  whisper, an asthmatic rasp as noisy as an engine's safety valve&mdash;"I
  mistrust that doctor from Madras who is attending the Rajah's cousin."</p>

  <p>"I know him," said another voice. "He is a charlatan."</p>

  <p>"I intend," said Ananda Raz, "as soon as possible to send another doctor
  to the Rajah's cousin, at my own expense if necessary."</p>

  <p>"There is," the voice answered, "as it happens, a doctor at
  rail-head&mdash;just over the border&mdash;at the Sikh dispensary&mdash;an
  American. He is an enthusiast who would cost you next to nothing."</p>

  <p>Panic seized Syed-Suraj. Cold sweat crept along his forearms. As the
  Rajah's Dick-o'-dirty-work, suspicion would certainly fall on him if some
  reputable doctor were to diagnose poison. And he knew his Rajah.
  Cousin-poisoners and money-gyps are hardly likely to protect their intimates
  if danger to themselves looks serious. He could see himself hanged as a
  murderer&mdash;could almost see the Rajah grinning over perjured evidence.
  The cold sweat turned to hot sweat and again grew cold before the inner
  office door was opened and Ananda Raz invited him to
  enter&mdash;melancholy-looking, shrew-nosed, small Ananda Raz, in a neat
  white turban, gold-bespectacled and irritable, wearing the thread of the
  "twice-born."</p>

  <p>"You are unwelcome, but never mind. I am busy, but I dare say that it
  doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>That was a bad beginning, although only the obvious Brahmin reaction to
  his having omitted the phrase "I kiss feet." Nobody who wants a Brahmin's
  good-will should omit that formula. But there was worse to follow&mdash;a
  shocking spectacle. In a chair outside the railing beyond which no
  non-Brahmin might trespass with calamitous impurities, near the lawyer's
  desk, Chullunder Ghose sat smiling like a fat, complacent toad! The most
  dangerous man in the C.I.D., in confidential standing with the enemy's
  attorney!</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj had not meant what he said when he told the Rajah he was not a
  statesman; he did not consider himself a rat who would pimp for a rattlesnake
  if there were comfort in it. There was no comfort here&mdash;none whatever.
  He had overheard the conversation through the crack, so he knew that
  Chullunder Ghose at least suspected that the Rajah's cousin was being
  poisoned. Not improbably the babu also shrewdly guessed who had instigated
  the attempt to murder himself; he had probably added two and two together and
  was out for vengeance. It was time for Syed-Suraj to swap horses. He tried it
  instantly:</p>

  <p>"Am I right," he asked&mdash;he looked directly at the babu&mdash;"in
  supposing that the C.I.D. have sent you to contrive a political change here?
  An important change? If so, I might help you. I am thoroughly disgusted with
  the goings-on. I have done my best to solve the tiger difficulty; as you
  know, it was I who told Hawkes to shoot the brute." He hesitated, then stared
  at Ananda Raz, conjecturing what shot might penetrate the Brahmin's
  prejudices. "This morning I spent an hour attempting to convince the Rajah
  that he ought to purify himself and make peace with the priesthood. But I
  can't convince him."</p>

  <p>"You are his intimate. Why not set him the example?" Ananda Raz ask
  pointedly.</p>

  <p>"I can't afford it. And, besides, it might lose me the,
  Rajah's&mdash;ah&mdash;friendship, and that would destroy my usefulness." He
  eyed Ananda Raz. "I could do it afterwards."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"A more generous patron might&mdash;ah&mdash;might provide me with the
  stiff fees that the priests demand for ritual purification. If the Rajah's
  cousin knew how sincerely I would work for and welcome his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ananda Raz snorted. He seemed unimpressed. He wiped his spectacles. "If
  you have anything to tell us, tell it," he breathed. It was too like a
  snake's hiss to encourage indiscretion. Syed-Suraj grinned back, catwise.</p>

  <p>"Make me an offer," he suggested.</p>

  <p>But it was Chullunder Ghose who made the offer&mdash;suddenly, before
  Ananda Raz could answer: "Get out of the State, and stay out."</p>

  <p>"But I can't afford it. Can't you see, you fool, that you should use
  me?"</p>

  <p>"How so?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"I could get proof!"</p>

  <p>"Proof of what?"</p>

  <p>"Someone is murdering someone." Chullunder Ghose smiled like a seraph.
  "Yes," he said, "and certain sorts of murderers need parasites to cover up
  their tracks&mdash;sycophants to hire their doctors from Madras. Get out of
  the State, you jackal! Leave your royal tiger to the huntsmen!"</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj wilted. "Oh, all right," he answered, "since you put it that
  way."</p>

  <p>"If I catch you here tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will go today. I will take tonight's train."</p>

  <p>"Get a permit from the Rajah. You will need it. And I don't care what you
  tell him," said the babu.</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj strode out, dignified&mdash;if dignity consists in throwing up
  one's chin. And it is difficult to hold that pose and notice things, still
  more difficult if one must hold an umbrella against a rainstorm. He did not,
  for instance, notice a man in rags, a beggar possibly, who followed him
  almost as far as the palace gate. The ragged, dish-faced person dodged behind
  a tree six feet away, exactly at the moment when a mud-bedraggled member of
  the State constabulary, staggering with weariness, stepped out from the
  shelter of that same tree and confronted Syed-Suraj. It was squally; the
  constable seized the umbrella and held it to windward, protecting them both.
  So most of the conversation reached the man who listened. He was
  downwind.</p>

  <p>"Careful, sahib! Someone, who I think is a friend of the fat babu, just
  now offered me ten rupees to tell what I know. I refused."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, silver jangled in a tunic pocket, and it was certainly not
  pay-day. However, that might be coincidence, and Syed-Suraj pretended not to
  notice. The constable continued:</p>

  <p>"Something went wrong. He who should have slain that babu was himself
  slain by a priest from Kali's temple, who was on his way from having taken
  goats for sacrifice at that old ruin in the jungle."</p>

  <p>"Who said that? Who knows it?"</p>

  <p>"We four found the body. And Hawkes knows it. With Hawkes, on an elephant,
  is he who saw the deed done&mdash;a fool of a villager; we would have brought
  him here in custody, but Hawkes said no; he took the fellow with him. What
  now? May I have an elephant to bring the dead man to the city?"</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj sneered back: "How do I know? What do I care? Ask His
  Highness."</p>

  <p>"He is in his bibi-kana.* None may summon him," said the constable. His
  voice held envy or contempt; it was not easy to tell which.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>bibi-kana, beebee khana</i> (Hindi)&mdash;women's
  quarters, zenana. ]</p>

  <p>"Do you expect me to enter the zenana?" Syed-Suraj retorted.</p>

  <p>"Wait here until you are sent for."</p>

  <p>"I am weary, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Constables sometimes are, they tell me. What are you paid for? Wait
  there."</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj hurried toward the palace, still not noticing the dish-faced
  man behind the tree, who ran before the rain until he once more reached the
  office of Ananda Raz. But he did not enter; he sat in the rain and waited for
  Chullunder Ghose. He appeared to be doing, it might be, penance, wrapped up
  in a piece of ragged sacking.</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj went into the palace and demanded instant audience with the
  Rajah.</p>

  <p>"If he has a dozen women in his lap, I don't care! I will see him
  now&mdash;do you hear me? Tell him."</p>

  <p>So the Rajah fumed into the library, showing his teeth. He smelled of
  blended perfumes. "What the devil does this mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Good-by! I'm off."</p>

  <p>"Curse your impudence! I'll shoot you like a dog if you ever again dare to
  summon me from the zenana!"</p>

  <p>"Never again, I assure you! Give me my percentage of the loan from Ram
  Dass."</p>

  <p>"To the devil with you! All you do is badger me for money!"</p>

  <p>"Better pay me this time, or I might talk! I'm deserting you. That's
  final."</p>

  <p>"You treacherous swine!" The Rajah turned his back, but watched the
  mirror. He opened the mirror&mdash;took out a revolver&mdash;faced about
  abruptly. "Dog of a traitor! What does this mean?" he demanded, walking
  forward.</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj backed away from him. "Steady now, steady! I've warned you
  often enough against your temper. Don't make matters worse by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell me, damn you! What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, my good man; oh, nothing, oh, dear me, no!" Syed-Suraj found
  that tart sneer irresistible. "I warned you. Did you listen? Not you! Now the
  priests know you are poisoning your cousin! Furthermore, Chullunder Ghose is
  alive, in the city, in touch with the priests&mdash;one of whom killed the
  man whom you sent out to murder Chullunder Ghose. Do you suppose the babu
  doesn't guess who ordered him killed and buried in a swamp? And what does
  that mean? That you have the C.I.D. against you! That is why I am going. Give
  me money and a travel permit."</p>

  <p>The Rajah took three steps forward. "You propose to desert me, eh? You
  propose to betray me from over the border! Probably you hope to toady to my
  cousin! Speak, you hyena! Have you sold yourself? To whom? For how much?"</p>

  <p>Syed-Suraj backed away again. He struck a footstool&mdash;staggered.
  Probably the Rajah misinterpreted the sudden jerk toward him in an effort to
  recover balance. He raised the revolver. Panic-stricken, Syed-Suraj clutched
  at his wrist. The Rajah fired three times, to summon a servant.</p>

  <p>"Help!" he shouted. "Help! Help!" frenzy of indignation making him forget
  he was using English. Syed-Suraj, wincing as the shots smashed the
  window-glass, struck at the Rajah and tried to escape before a servant could
  arrive. He poked two fingers at the Rajah's eyes. The Rajah shot
  him&mdash;twice&mdash;through the heart. As he fell he kicked him four or
  five times in the face.</p>

  <p>Then the Rajah's mood changed. Languidly he turned and faced the door. It
  had opened. His personal servant stood there. He signed to the man to close
  it and come nearer. Then he stared into the man's eyes.</p>

  <p>"You, who saw what happened, did you see him take my revolver from the
  closet behind the mirror?"</p>

  <p>The servant nodded, wide-eyed, silent.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear him threaten me? And did you see him try to shoot me, three
  times, as I stood between him and the window?"</p>

  <p>The servant gravely bowed assent.</p>

  <p>"And did you hear him boast that the priests will provide him an alibi,
  and pay him handsomely for killing me, because they wish my cousin on the
  throne?"</p>

  <p>The servant bowed.</p>

  <p>"And did you see me snatch the pistol from him?"</p>

  <p>"It was well done," said the servant. "Others saw it also. I will go and
  find them."</p>

  <p>The Rajah poured himself brandy-and-soda, smiled, and drank it.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, proud of his self-control, "bring them in. Refresh their
  memories. Talk with one another."</p>

  <p>He drank another gulp of brandy&mdash;straight, and strode out, back to
  the zenana.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER 10</a><br>
  "Whoever it is, is as scared as I am"</h2>

  <p class="first">THE rain ceased, but the river had risen; it poured out of
  the jungle with a gurgling rush that carried big trees ducking and bobbing in
  mid-stream. Men from the merchants' bivouac on the near side gathered around
  Hawkes and warned him that not even an elephant could cross for possibly a
  week to come. No one could remember such a monsoon. They regretted having
  started out so prematurely. They were beginning to lack provisions; they
  described themselves as idiots for not having returned to the city along with
  the man who had taken the fat babu for nothing; nothing, mind you!</p>

  <p>"But the babu had a way with him. A madman. Or perhaps a holy person:
  Holiness makes some folk impudent. Besides, the owner of the cart and horses
  was afraid of the woman across the river; but the babu claimed to have
  authority from her. It might be; and she might be dangerous; men say so.
  There are great owls in the jungle, and they cry too much; men say they cry
  out to announce the prowling of that woman and her tiger."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the tiger?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay! Could it cross the river?"</p>

  <p>"How do the priests cross when they bring goats? I'm told they bring 'em
  once a week for a sacrifice of some sort in a ruined temple."</p>

  <p>"Who knows? Some say they cross by a bridge. The people hereabouts won't
  speak of it, except as something to stay away from. They pretend it is
  guarded by evil spirits. Now and then they tell the truth, those
  villagers."</p>

  <p>Hawkes's passenger had heard the conversation. He admitted that he knew
  there was a ruin&mdash;and a tiger&mdash;and a priestess. The tiger killed
  folk, and the priestess ate them; everybody knew that. But a bridge? He shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"How do the priests cross the river?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"They sit on a mat, and the mat gets up and flies. But some say that the
  owls pick up the mat and carry it."</p>

  <p>"That sounds more probable!" said Hawkes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, much more probable. How could the priests make a mat fly?"</p>

  <p>The mahout was adamant. His elephant could not possibly swim the river,
  and he himself would rather die than ride into that jungle to look for a
  bridge.</p>

  <p>"For should there be a bridge, it might not bear the elephant. And whoever
  heard of a bridge in a jungle? But every one has heard of evil spirits. They
  are bad for elephants. An elephant goes crazy and kills, and smashes things,
  when evil spirits enter him."</p>

  <p>Threats, bribes, arguments, were useless, until at last Hawkes gave the
  elephant a lump of corncake soaked in whisky, to establish confidence, and
  ordered the elephant to hoist him up to the mahout's seat. With his legs
  behind the great beast's ears he urged him forward. The mahout's mind changed
  then. He declared his honor was at stake. He shrieked disconsolately, as a
  man should who, for honor's sake, must plunge into the midst of devil's
  magic. Hawkes crawled into the howdah and took his rifle from its case; but
  rifles are no good against devils. The mahout climbed by the elephant's knee
  to the elephant's neck; white-eyed with terror he demanded whisky, which is
  good against everything. Hawkes gave him some.</p>

  <p>Then tank-work, such as only elephants, of all living things, can
  do&mdash;crushing, sliding, grinding, breaking, crashing into
  undergrowth&mdash;plunging through the tributaries of the river, following
  its course and smashing down the thickets&mdash;turning aside for nothing but
  the big trees and the biggest boulders. Time and again the howdah and its
  load were almost ripped off; half a dozen times Hawkes swung by the arms from
  a branch of a tree to save himself from being brained. But the elephant
  waited for him, and they went on, mile upon gloomier mile, drenched, bitten
  by a million mosquitoes, leaving a track behind them that a blind man could
  have followed if he only were amphibian. And at last, about four in the
  afternoon, the going became firmer. Limestone cropped up through the tree
  roots and the trees were less huge, although as dense as ever. The weary
  elephant appeared encouraged, as if he recognized the neighborhood of humans,
  where a decent beast was likely to get dinner. Suddenly the river curved; it
  thundered down a waterfall between sheer flanks of limestone, with a
  fern-filled, rocky island in the midst.</p>

  <p>It was easy to see there had been a bridge there once upon a time,
  although its fallen masonry had long ago been swept down-stream by rain-fed
  torrents such as this one. There had been a road of some importance; some of
  its paving-blocks, up-ended by resistless trees, stood up like tombstones in
  the jungle. For a bridge now, there was nothing but a hand-rope, taut across
  the river, and two tree-trunks&mdash;near bank to the island, island to the
  far bank. They were slippery with rain and only half-trimmed; branches
  blocked the way along them. It was something that a goat or a man could
  tackle; for an elephant, it might as well not be there. The mahout grinned,
  chattering with terror, but relieved because this seemed to be the limit.</p>

  <p>Hawkes pulled out a flashlight from the bedding-roll, shouldered his rifle
  by the sling and put some spare shells in his pocket, filled the other pocket
  with some chocolate and biscuits, looked to his flask and gave his
  orders.</p>

  <p>"Set me down," he said, "and wait here. Feed your elephant and hunt some
  dry wood. It's getting late; if we have to make a night of it we'll need
  fire."</p>

  <p>He poured all that was left of the whisky on the elephant's big, flat
  corn-loaves. Then he started across the bridge. It was a slow job, although
  the rope helped; the rifle and flask slings kept on catching in the
  half-trimmed branches, and by the time he reached the island he was dizzy
  with exertion and with the roar of the torrent beneath him. He rested on a
  pile of masonry that had once formed a part of the bridge. Then he glanced
  back at the elephant&mdash;one of those sudden, intuitive movements that the
  dogmatists explain away by calling them coincidence.</p>

  <p>He could see the mahout in his place on the elephant's neck; and before
  that sight set thought in motion he became aware of danger. The mahout did
  not look round; he merely urged the elephant. Before Hawkes could think or
  shout, the elephant was going full pelt through the jungle, back along the
  way he came. There was only a glimpse of him, gray as the tree-trunk shadows.
  He was gone in a second.</p>

  <p>Hawkes shrugged his shoulders. It was no use swearing. He would kick the
  liver out of that mahout in good time. Meanwhile, what next? Forward was
  hardly likely to be worse than backward, and he could not possibly struggle
  back to the ford before sunset. Neither was it the slightest use to sit
  still. Besides, he was dripping wet; the elephant had shaken down continual
  showers of water from the trees, and Hawkes had a wholesome dread of a night
  in wet clothes in the fever-ridden jungle. He decided to go forward and to
  look first for a place where he could spend the night. Next, he would look
  for dry wood. Then, if there was any time left before sunset, he would try to
  discover a path towards the village on the far side of the river. He was
  angry, but not in the least discouraged.</p>

  <p>The tiger, for the moment, gave him no concern whatever. With his
  double-barreled .577 express and sufficient daylight he felt well able to
  care for himself; by nightfall he proposed to have a hot fire going that
  would keep any tiger away and be smoky enough to defeat the much more
  dangerous mosquitoes. Chullunder Ghose's curious injunction not to shoot the
  tiger troubled him least of all; if he had seen the tiger there and then he
  would have shot the brute without a moment's hesitation. But as he worked his
  way along the slippery tree-trunk, with the hungry dark-brown flood beneath
  him, he did wonder why the babu should have been so emphatic about it.</p>

  <p>"Damn him, he knows me. He should have chosen a native for this job if he
  didn't want the tiger sent west."</p>

  <p>Something hit him on the helmet. It was a fine, big, padded helmet with a
  waterproof cover. It absorbed shock, so that the stone, or whatever it was,
  did no harm except almost to make him lose his footing. Sacred monkeys
  sometimes swarm amid ancient ruins; thinking of the ruins that he hoped to
  find, he supposed for a moment that one of the monkeys had pelted him, as
  they frequently do. He hurried to the far bank, scrambled to the ground and
  looked up at the tree-tops. Not a sign of monkeys. But another stone hit him
  a crack on the jaw.</p>

  <p>He unslung his rifle, cocked it, stared about him and aimed at a sound.
  There was something moving in a thicket, or behind the thicket. He was
  certain it was not a tiger. Someone who had flung that stone was
  lurking&mdash;looking at him. He could feel eyes. He began to walk toward the
  thicket. Something or somebody scurried away, not making more noise than a
  furtive animal, but it was an unrecognizable noise. Elimination left no
  probability except that a human being was trying to scare him back the way he
  came, but was afraid to be seen.</p>

  <p>"Hell! Whoever it is, is as scared as I am," he reflected. Knowing he was
  rather scared, he set his jaw and squared his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Half-light filtered through the trees of a jungle under heavy clouds,
  induces nervousness. It makes a sound seem half-mysterious and wholly
  dreadful. Hawkes was neither superstitious nor a weakling, but the
  goose-flesh rose all over him. He was as dangerous then as dynamite. He would
  have shot at anything he saw. But he could see nothing. The trees were not
  nearly so dense on this side of the river, due to sheet-rock that afforded
  only random root-hold; undergrowth was dense where it had found a lodging,
  but there was not much of it to give a fair view in all directions, except
  where boulders blocked the way. Much of the undergrowth was fern, a little
  less than waist-high, drenching wet, but passable. And, winding through the
  fern, if not a track, at least something that faintly suggested one, appeared
  to take an almost definite direction. Much too nervous now to care to stand
  still, Hawkes decided to follow that track.</p>

  <p>It led away from the gloom of the jungle. It presently curved into a space
  of ten or fifteen acres where a fire had raged not long ago and second-growth
  was barely knee-high. Stumps and charred downwood barred the way, but the
  footpath, more distinct now, wound amid them. On the right hand, sunset
  bathed the sky in furious crimson. On the left hand was a pond an acre in
  extent, half-filled with lotus-pads and still surrounded by limestone
  masonry, broken, but not so badly that one could not see some of the steps
  that once had lined the pond on all four sides. And beyond the pond, the
  ruined temple.</p>

  <p>It was a heap of grim blocks, tumbled by an earthquake. Trees had rooted
  in the cracks, and done more havoc than the tremors that had wrecked the roof
  and some of the enormous columns. Giant creepers, flaming in the sunset,
  seemed to tie the mass together as if jungle-gods had drawn a net around it
  to preserve its shapelessness. Nothing remained of a temple, seen from
  outside, except one huge image, partly fallen, tilted forward and to one
  side, staring downward. Unimaginably held by roots and broken masonry, it
  grinned at its reflection in the still pool&mdash;loathsome on a blood-red
  mirror&mdash;cruel, calm, impassionate. A million frogs made music to it. On
  its head, amid the carving of the hair, a seed had rooted and produced a
  drooping spray of green that made the head look drunken. And the coarse lips
  and the lazy, heavy-lidded eyes smiled confidently at the glutted drunkenness
  of death that swallows life, and even swallows death itself, and ends in
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Hawkes remembered he was hungry then and ate some chocolate. There was
  plenty of charred wood that would make a camp-fire; there was time enough,
  too, to gather up a good load. Nothing for it but the ruins; he must take his
  chance of snakes and hunt for a nook or cranny large enough to spend the
  night in. He could build a fire in the entrance and dry his wet clothes.
  Forward!</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes' scramble over fallen masonry and tangled creepers brought
  him to a window, or what had been one. It was nothing but a shapeless, dark
  hole, but it opened into what the flashlight revealed as a cell, about twenty
  feet by ten, with walls of heavily carved limestone, and so deep in bat-dirt
  that there was no guessing what the floor was made of. At the far end there
  were shadows and a broken masonry partition, but Hawkes did not stay to
  examine those; he went for wood. After half a dozen trips he had enough to
  keep a good fire going all night; so he frayed up tinder with his
  clasp-knife, economically built his watch-fire in the middle of the hole, and
  set to work to clear a piece of floor to sit on, scraping away the bat-filth
  with a piece of charred wood. The stench turned his stomach, so he let it
  alone after a few minutes and decided to sit on a loose, square block of
  stone that had a clean side when he turned it over. Then he pulled his
  clothes off and began to dry them at the fire.</p>

  <p>So he was naked, except for his socks and boots, when something stirred
  away behind him in the dark beyond the broken masonry partition. He grabbed
  his rifle. Then he pulled his trousers on. He listened. Suddenly he used the
  flashlight, but it made the darkness even darker where the shadows lay beyond
  the broken masonry. He felt his trousers slipping, so he had to tighten his
  belt with one hand while he clutched his rifle with the other. He held the
  flashlight between his knees; the light went upward, terrifying scores of
  bats that were disturbed enough already by the watch-fire in the entrance. By
  the time he had his belt tight and the flashlight aimed again there was a
  woman staring at him.</p>

  <p>She had stepped from behind the broken half-wall at the far end. One could
  tell she was a woman by her long hair, flowing to her waist but gummed into
  ropes with blue mud. From her breasts, as flat as pancakes, to her knees, as
  gnarled as tree-knots, she was covered with a goatskin apron. She had no
  eyebrows. Her eyes glowed sullenly from dark holes in a wrinkled face that
  looked as hard as bronze. Her lips seemed hardly skin-thick, tight against
  splendid teeth that were as yellow as amber. Beauty that had left her as the
  tide leaves the barren beaches, made her terrible by hinting it had been
  hers.</p>

  <p>And another thing was terrible. Emaciated, scarred by thorn and weather,
  she stood straight as a spear and as strong as an Amazon. Life had not left
  her; it lingered and burned in a scarred mask. And she looked as if she hated
  life, that rioted in sinewy, strong loneliness, and gave her nothing.</p>

  <p>"Cheerio," said Hawkes. "I've chocolate and biscuit. Come and have
  some."</p>

  <p>No answer. He repeated the invitation in Hindustani. "Come on, mother.
  Come and share supper with me. I'll forgive you for hitting my jaw with a
  rock. It was you. No use lying. Who else could have done that?"</p>

  <p>Again no answer. But she beckoned, holding a long stick like a spear in
  her left hand, motioning with her right arm stretched out in front of her at
  full length, four upturned fingers summoning, unmistakable.</p>

  <p>"All right, mother. I can lick you," he remarked. "I'll follow."</p>

  <p>She turned on her heel, and from behind she was as splendid as a statue of
  youth, with the goatskin loosely drawn round her loins and nothing but the
  long blue ropes of hair to hint at old age. The muscles of her back, as she
  moved, were ripples in the flashlight.</p>

  <p>"Hell! I wonder&mdash;could I lick you?" Hawkes thought. But with his
  thumb he set the safety catch of his rifle. "Hell! I'd hate to shoot a woman.
  Why not stay here?"</p>

  <p>But he followed. Curiosity was stronger than good sense.</p>

  "How about a permit?"</h2>

  <p class="first">STANLEY COPELAND suddenly&mdash;as such things happen
  &mdash;saw that he had bitten off a mouthful that a dozen of him could hardly
  have chewed. He was getting no rest, and the Sikh was as tired as
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Say, you and I are like the old lady who tried to sweep back the Atlantic
  with a house-broom," he said; and the Sikh stared wide-eyed at him, equally
  enthusiastic, equally conscious of human limits, but guiltily aware of a
  waiting list of crippled, maimed, and sick who had responded to the call of
  naive propaganda.</p>

  <p>"We're like Germany, we need a moratorium," said Copeland. "I'm game to
  buy my standing with hard work, but you and I are just snowballs in hell,
  that's what we are. Next thing, both of us will go sick. Nurse each other, I
  suppose, eh?"</p>

  <p>"But I have some very interesting cases for you," said the Sikh
  apologetically. "I am even hoping to bring you a leper."</p>

  <p>"The devil you are. You may not believe it, Kater Singh, but what I crave
  now is strong drink and a tiger. I'm sick of patching cripples. I want to
  kill something. Philanthropy palls. If you brought me a really rare eye, I
  could walk out on you. That's the plain truth."</p>

  <p>"God relieves the over-burdened," the Sikh quoted piously. And that was
  also true, apparently, because the door opened without a knock that instant.
  The Sikh scowled, not so positively sure of God's benevolence as speech might
  indicate. Copeland turned about and faced Chullunder Ghose, the
  omni-impudent, the all-observing, genial and fat to look at in his English
  shooting-jacket and his homespun loin-cloth.</p>

  <p>"Don't you like it?" he asked, lifting the loin-cloth like a ballet-girl's
  skirt. He did a caricature of Pavlova. "It is my concession to Mahatma
  Gandhi. All things in their turn to all men&mdash;not too much, though, or
  they love you, and their love is dreadful."</p>

  <p>"Drink?" suggested Copeland.</p>

  <p>"You will go far. Never have I seen a swifter diagnosis. Eighty percent of
  diagnoses&mdash;so says Osler&mdash;are inaccurate, but yours is <i>verb.
  sap.</i> to the ultimate dimension! Let me warn you, whisky is forbidden by
  the Sikh religion. Order, therefore, three drinks. We will drink ours swiftly
  to preserve him from the sin of voting too dry and becoming too wet."</p>

  <p>Copeland produced the whisky bottle, and his servant brought the glasses
  and siphon. They drank in silence until Copeland set the glass down. "I'd
  forgotten what it tastes like!"</p>

  <p>"Same here," said the babu. "And the sun is shining! Your eyes assure me
  you have forgotten what that looks like! Come and see it! Twenty million
  miles of mud&mdash;and only one macadam road in all Kutchdullub! But it leads
  you to the city, and it starts here. I've a Ford car."</p>

  <p>"How about a permit?" Copeland asked. "I've had a formally polite but firm
  communication from the Foreign Office calling my attention to section
  so-and-so of Order in Council number umpty-um restricting the movement of
  aliens into Native States."</p>

  <p>"Did it mention boils?" Chullunder Ghose asked. "Boils on the back of a
  bachelor's neck&mdash;of a hypochondriacal bachelor's neck&mdash;of a white
  babu's neck&mdash;an officially dignified and economically useless, ethically
  hypocritical anachronism's neck? I think not. Circumstances alter cases. I
  could do the job as well as you can, with a safety-razor blade. But dignity
  would call that impudence. Besides, I need a mouse to help me nibble at the
  nets of Humpty-Dumpty on a rocking-horse. He rocks like hell, I tell you. One
  shove&mdash;and we shall have his alternative, probably worse, undoubtedly
  not much better, but different. That is nature. Work with nature, same as
  Osler ordered. Are you coming?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. But coming where? Why? Do I get the tiger?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, unless he gets you. And unless you are afraid of moss-back majors
  with a mid-Victorian morality that makes them fit this epoch as a pig fits an
  automobile."</p>

  <p>"Frighten me later on," said Copeland. "You have pulled my cork. I'm
  coming." He grinned at the Sikh. "You'll have enough to keep you busy till I
  come back. Keep all those eyes in the dark, if you can, and remember what I
  showed you about draining deep wounds. Go slow with iodoform, and don't let
  'em change their own dressings. I'll be back&mdash;when?"</p>

  <p>"Then!" the babu answered. "When it's over. When the Major has been
  recommended for a decoration, and when you and I have received our reprimand!
  Observe my belly; it is obese with reprimands. The walls of my wife's
  bathroom in her home in Delhi are beautified with fifty of them, framed in
  pale pink. Let us go now."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER 12</a><br>
  "The devil quotes scripture, sahib"</h2>

  <p class="first">MAJOR EUSTACE SMITH, in a sweater and blazer with a scarf
  round his neck that gave him almost the appearance of a rowing man, paced the
  tiled veranda, pausing at frequent intervals to glare into the Residency
  garden. He had to turn his whole body in order to do it, because the boils on
  the back of his neck were in the sharply painful stage. The garden offered no
  encouragement; it was a drab, wet, dreary wilderness of half-neglected
  flowers ruined by the rain. The sun had burst forth through the brown-gray
  clouds, but nothing welcomed it except the weeds and a lonely bull-frog, who
  reiterated big drum belches of enthusiasm from an unseen puddle.</p>

  <p>"Curse and damn my luck!" Smith exploded. "Why the devil is that fat brute
  taking all this time to bring a doctor?" To have a murder on his
  hands&mdash;a palace murder&mdash;with a little less than three months more
  to go before leaving India forever&mdash;"Damn that Rajah! Damn and blast him
  for a skunk in velvet! Does he think this is Chicago? To avoid a scandal I
  shall have to accept whatever lies he cares to trump up. But for two-pence,
  if I had my own way, I would hang him, dammit!"</p>

  <p>He had learned of the shooting of Syed-Suraj two hours after the event,
  through palace spies who brought the information to the back door. He had
  spent a whole night disbelieving it, inertia suggesting to him that it might,
  after all, be another rumor cooked up by the Rajah's enemies. But with the
  dawn Chullunder Ghose had come&mdash;that scoundrelly babu with the
  know-nothing face and omniscient eyes. The babu had had the story first-hand
  from the female servant of a woman in the Rajah's over-full zenana; she had
  heard and seen the whole thing through a panel in the wall above a bookshelf,
  where she had been lurking to report the Rajah's movements for the
  information of her own neglected mistress.</p>

  <p>And the worst of that was that Chullunder Ghose would write his own report
  to a Department that regarded Smith as less than nobody, but that employed
  the babu and accepted his information at face value because &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, dammit! Why do they insist on knowing everything that goes on? Not a
  chance for a man to use his own discretion! I could smooth this over. I
  suppose they'll order me to investigate. God-dammit, and the chances are some
  idiot will get his lies all mixed up. Then the cat's out of the bag &mdash;
  and gee-whiz! I had better send my own report in&mdash;telegram in
  code&mdash;before the babu gets his off. Confound him, the fat brute has
  probably wired from rail-head! I had better ask for full discretion, on the
  ground that all reports are not in, and it may be possible to clear the
  individual on whom suspicion now rests. That's it."</p>

  <p>He wrote his telegram, translated it to code, checked and rechecked it,
  destroyed the original, gave the coded version to his office babu to be
  signaled and then returned to the veranda.</p>

  <p>He was nearly frantic from the bandaged neck boils when a Ford car with a
  flat tire clattered to the front door, and its abominable honking jarred
  Smith's nerves so that a murder seemed like sweetly, reasonable justice. If a
  snarl and a scowl could kill he would have slain his servant.</p>

  <p>"Show them in, you idiot! The library&mdash;yes&mdash;where else? Do I
  receive visitors in the bathroom?"</p>

  <p>He paced the veranda again a few times, trying to calm himself. But the
  abominable bull-frog mocked him, a mosquito bit him and he slapped his face
  to kill it. That jerked his head and sent a stab of pain into his neck that
  nearly made him cry out.</p>

  <p>"Going all to hell!" he muttered. "Eustace, old fellow, take a pull
  now&mdash;steady!&mdash;steady!"</p>

  <p>He thrust both his fists into the blazer pockets and tried to stroll into
  the library, remembering that he had donned that ancient blazer merely to
  impress the damned American, who very likely would expect him to be wearing
  gold-braid and a cocked hat. Nothing like a little informality with
  foreigners. It takes em off guard.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I'm pleased to meet you, Doctor Copeland. It is very kind, indeed, of
  you to come and see me. I am only sorry that I had to send a Ford car and a
  very unofficial babu to escort you. But the Residency staff is quite
  inadequate for such emergencies."</p>

  <p>"That's perfectly all right," said Copeland, setting his bag on the table.
  He glanced at Chullunder Ghose, and even Smith could see that those two
  understood each other. Chullunder Ghose answered the glance and then stared
  out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Did you send a telegram from rail-head?" Smith asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the babu. He had sent one from the city before seeing
  Smith that morning, in a code more intricate than Smith's, so he was saved
  from lying. But he would have lied, if necessary.</p>

  <p>"I can see you need a sedative," said Copeland. "Let me give you that
  first. As a working rule, it's not a bad idea to get rid of the discomfort
  and then see what's left that needs attention." He was looking into Smith's
  eyes. He felt his pulse without glancing at it. "Tongue, please." There were
  no apparent symptoms of the solitary drinking that he half-suspected. "If
  you'll swallow these &mdash;" He gave him three big, sugar-coated pellets.
  "Now, if I may have a basin of warm water, we'll take that bandage off."</p>

  <p>"Is yours what you would call a bedside manner?" Smith asked. He could not
  resist the impulse to be disagreeable. He hated anyone who dared to take
  charge. The suggestion to remove the bandage should have come from himself,
  as the senior. "May I ask how much your fee is for a consultation?"</p>

  <p>Copeland stared at him, then caught the babu's eye again and smiled.</p>

  <p>"There will be no charge for the consultation. I will tell you in advance
  how much the rest of it will cost you when I know what needs doing."</p>

  <p>"And if I let you do it!"</p>

  <p>"Quite so"</p>

  <p>Then the basin came, and towels. Smith sat with his back to a window and
  Copeland carefully undid the bandage. Then he wetted the dressing and
  snatched it off so suddenly that Smith screamed. "Dammit! Oh, my God, that
  hurt me!"</p>

  <p>It had hurt him all right. He put his head between his hands and moaned;
  but that was eyewash, to explain away the scream; the pain was over in a
  fraction of a second. Copeland studied the boils.</p>

  <p>"They're bad," he said, "and they'll be worse before they're better. Do
  you like pain?"</p>

  <p>"That's an idiotic question! What needs doing?"</p>

  <p>"I should say you need to wangle me a permit to go tiger-hunting."</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible, my dear sir. You Americans imagine you can do as you
  jolly well please, whatever government you favor with your disrespect. But I
  assure you this is one place where you toe the line like other people. You
  may not go after tiger in Kutchdullub."</p>

  <p>"I will bandage you again," said Copeland. "Keep still."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you can do nothing for me?" Smith turned suddenly to look at
  him. The involuntary movement was a torture worse than pulling off the
  dressing, and it lasted longer. "Yow! It's agony, I tell you!"</p>

  <p>"No doubt. But it isn't serious," said Copeland. "You can stick it out, I
  reckon. Once a surgeon names his fee it's scarcely ethical to take less. My
  fee is a tiger permit&mdash;just one tiger."</p>

  <p>"I have no authority to grant one."</p>

  <p>"Then we're two of a kind," Copeland answered. "I have no license to
  practise surgery in the State of Kutchdullub. I have a complimentary license
  for British-India, but Native States aren't mentioned."</p>

  <p>Smith smiled, forcing it; he tried hard to recover geniality and decent
  manners. "Did you see the British flag?" he answered. "Within the walls of
  this Residency you are on British ground."</p>

  <p>But either somebody had tutored Copeland or he had done his own thinking
  exceedingly well in advance. "That may be law," he said, "but it's a mighty
  thin excuse for me to bet on. I came here to treat boils, not to split hairs.
  Do I get a crack at tiger? Come along, I'll match you! You risk your
  certificate, and I'll risk mine!"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly unheard of!" Smith exploded. But Chullunder Ghose came over
  from the other window and, as meek as Moses, sat at Smith's feet, smiling
  upward.</p>

  <p>"Will your honor kindly send for secret correspondence file and study
  letter number O-A-7, date of August 30th?" he asked. "I saw a copy of it.
  Same applies to this case."</p>

  <p>"You may go to the devil," said Smith. But his memory stirred uneasy
  thought. Official secret correspondence was about as rare as fresh eggs for
  his breakfast, so he could hardly forget that letter. But the babu quoted
  from it&mdash;one whole paragraph:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"In view of all the circumstances, it is therefore urged
  upon all acting representatives of H.M. British-India Foreign Office to avoid
  any but the most discreet and only absolutely necessary interference at the
  courts of Native States. It is important that the public should not be
  encouraged, at this juncture, to believe that Native Princes are in any
  danger of removal from the throne or of loss of prerogatives; since
  obviously, if that impression should gain ground in an already heated and
  disturbed condition of affairs that may be likened to a major crisis, the
  authority of Princes might be challenged by their subjects, with results that
  it is difficult to foresee."</p><br>

  <p>Smiling at him, confidently impudent, but curiously oozing a sort of wise
  benevolence, the babu paused. He had done with quoting. Now for some
  diplomacy.</p>

  <p>"The Devil," he said, "quotes scripture, sahib. But your honor's humble
  servant, this babu, is devilishly <i>compos mentis</i> when it comes to stern
  realities. I think your honor would appreciate an O.M., or perhaps a C.S.I.,
  before retirement? Same is not impossible."</p>

  <p>"Curse your damned impertinence!" Smith answered. "Do you mean you sell
  'em?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, no. I wangle 'em! A decoration is a public honor worn by diplomats
  who know enough to trust a totally dishonorable person in a tight place. This
  is tight place&mdash;very. <i>Verb. sap.</i> Self am a dishonorable person;
  nobody could easily imagine me bedecorated with a star and ribbon. Reprimands
  are my meat; I enjoy same. I was reprimanded&mdash;and received a pay-raise
  incidentally&mdash;for getting the goods on the Afghan minister; but it was
  General Aloysius McCann who got the decoration. General McCann had hives;
  they made him as indignant as a hornet in a big drum. He threatened me with
  mayhem. But we saved an international imbroglio, and he got decorated for it.
  Now you! Why not be a properly bejeweled personage at your retirement three
  months hence? And is the neck not painful?"</p>

  <p>"Dammit, yes!" Smith answered, grateful for the opportunity to answer yes.
  Dignity did not permit him, in the presence of a damned American, to traffic
  for a ribbon. Humor beamed forth from the babu's mild eyes. He understood
  perfectly.</p>

  <p>"Let us suppose that you make a mistake," he suggested. "Then we lose
  what? Nothing! You retire in three months&mdash;pension check as regular as
  Hawkesey's presentation watch! And you can blame me, who am too notoriously
  unrespectable to dare to answer! But suppose it comes off &mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do?" Smith asked him.</p>

  <p>"Ah! If I myself knew, I might argue with myself, and that is fatal. And
  if you knew, you might try to educate me, which is much worse."</p>

  <p>"But you dare to try to educate me!"</p>

  <p>"God forbid it! I propose that you should give this eleemosynary
  eye-enthusiast a cagey sort of letter which his Yankee optimism can interpret
  into an authority from you to shoot a tiger on the Rajah's territory."</p>

  <p>"I can't do it."</p>

  <p>"He can make boils painless!" said the babu. With an angry gesture Smith
  repudiated the suggestion that his personal discomfort influenced him in any
  way whatever. But the movement almost made him yell with agony. He had to
  wait a minute before he could speak. He devoted the minute to furious
  thought.</p>

  <p>"If you should tell me, on your honor," he said then, "that you require
  this for the doctor for the purposes of C.I.D. I could stretch a point then.
  But I would require such an assurance from you."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I assure you on my honor that I need it."</p>

  <p>"And your honor rooted in dishonor stands!" Smith answered. He could not
  resist the obvious retort; he never could; no more than he could understand
  why so few friendships had graced his career. "It's a very risky course to
  take. I know nothing of Doctor Copeland. However, I might give him a note to
  His Highness asking for permission for him to go and shoot one tiger. There
  would be no obligation to present the letter to His Highness. He might
  possibly interpret it as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He will do so!" said the babu. "Will your honor kindly write it?"</p>

  <p>Major Eustace Smith, as desperately nervous as a schoolboy cheating at
  examinations, almost tiptoed to his desk. He wrote on Residency paper, with a
  quill pen, as illegibly as self-respect would let him&mdash;blotted it, which
  made it more illegible&mdash;inclosed it in an envelope, then crossed the
  room and handed it to Copeland.</p>

  <p>"That's your fee in advance," he remarked, "but I want it clearly
  understood between us that I haven't given you permission to go
  tiger-shooting. I have merely asked His Highness whether he would care to
  give you that permission."</p>

  <p>"It's as good as Greek to me," said Copeland. "I'm taking my cue from
  Chullunder Ghose. A Rajah and a circus amount to about the same thing in
  my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In your ignorance!" Smith snapped back. "Now, will you be good enough to
  earn your fee, sir?"</p>

  <p>Stanley Copeland went to work on him with pitifully skillful hands, a
  local anaesthetic and a lancet that had learned to stab as accurately as a
  sculptor's chisel. If he lacked a bedside manner he redeemed that by
  precision and the confidence that he had bought with hard work. The relief on
  Smith's face, when the job was over and the patient lying on the couch, was
  almost comical; his character, the habitual mask relaxed, leered upward
  loose-lipped and selfish.</p>

  <p>"Yours is an easy way to earn a living, isn't it?" he volunteered. "In New
  York I suppose you'd charge a hundred dollars a boil for play that's as easy
  to you as cutting toenails."</p>

  <p>"No, in New York I would send you to a Christian Scientist," said
  Copeland, "for a dose of divine intelligence. Take these in water &mdash;
  once every two hours, twice; then every four hours. Have you someone who can
  change the dressing once a day? Very well, I'll look in on you on my way back
  to the border. If anything goes wrong meanwhile, just cross the border to the
  Sikh dispensary&mdash;Kater Singh, his name is&mdash;he has no diploma, but
  he's O.K."</p>

  <p>"And we thank you," said the babu. "Have we now your honor's leave to give
  ourselves an absence treatment?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, yes. Go to hell!" said Smith. "You make me want to get my gun
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good-by," said the babu.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER 13</a><br>
  "Let us hope you have no conscience"</h2>

  <p class="first">A SPIRIT of mischief&mdash;nothing else whatever &mdash;
  actuated Copeland. He was coming up for air, and neither principalities nor
  powers&mdash;least of all a sense of reverence for stuffed shirts or
  responsibility to dead tradition&mdash;controlled his behavior. For months on
  end&mdash;particularly for the last ten days, he had been seeing humanity
  stripped, in the raw, with its weaknesses upward. His regard for it was
  limited to sympathy, without much of the sauce of admiration; and at the
  moment, as long as the mood should last, whoever failed to make him smile was
  no one, but whoever gave him belly-laughs was somebody. In plain words, he
  was tired out, and Chullunder Ghose had dawned on him like the rising sun at
  the end of a long, dark night.</p>

  <p>The tire was still flat; nobody had dreamed of fixing it. Another tire
  went presently. The babu drove serenely on the rims; he seemed unconscious of
  the jolting. Also, he seemed to believe that the horn was part of the
  propelling mechanism; from the Residency gate until they reached the city he
  scarcely stopped using it. There was an elephant in mid-street; it was half a
  mile ahead when they saw it first; it was still in mid-street when they
  caught up; it remained there; and the more the babu honked, the less inclined
  it seemed to get out of the way. The street grew narrower, and the crowds
  were out because the rain had let up for a few hours; it was a sullen swarm,
  touchy from close confinement indoors, and averse to making room for anyone.
  The elephant grew more and more afraid of the infernal noise behind him; the
  mahout, afraid of what might happen, concentrated on his mount and never once
  glanced backward; but the babu kept on honking.</p>

  <p>"For a C.I.D. man, I should say you advertise," said Copeland. "If I was
  the elephant I'd face about and squash us like a pat of wheat-cake. What's
  your hurry?"</p>

  <p>"That is the Rajah's elephant. Observe the mud on him. And there is
  Hawkesey's luggage in the howdah, but no Hawkesey. I must talk with the
  mahout."</p>

  <p>"You need a telephone. Jee-rusalem, this is a crazy city! What's that show
  ahead of us? A circus?"</p>

  <p>It was Kali's priesthood, reawakening the public consciousness of death by
  holding a procession through the streets. They had the image of the goddess
  Kali on a huge float drawn by twelve white oxen. Conch-horns blared amid a
  jamboree of cymbals, drums of lizard-skin, and jangling brass bells. Drawn
  towards it down a dozen streets, like water towards a central drain, the
  multitude roared&mdash;surged&mdash;sweated&mdash;beat its breasts and grew
  delirious with frenzy. Those in front of the procession lay to let the sacred
  oxen trample them, and had to be prodded away by the priests' sharp-ended
  sticks&mdash;a substituted pain, symbolical of the invited death and less
  embarrassing to the temporal power that prefers to gather taxes from the
  living rather than support the orphans of the dead.</p>

  <p>A Ford horn honking at his rump, and all that din ahead of him, the
  elephant chose hysteria as the only consolation left. He screamed. He raised
  his ears. He did a trample-dance in time to the incessant drumming of the
  ankus on his aching skull. And then he charged into the crowd like three
  insulted tons of dark-gray death endeavoring to slay them all at once.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell! I go to work again," said Copeland. But Chullunder Ghose
  ignored that. He had left off honking. He had eyes for nothing but the
  howdah.</p>

  <p>The disturbance had awakened someone. Out from under a tarpaulin someone
  crawled who had his head through a hole in a blanket and a decorated
  sheaf-knife hanging at his loins. He gave a glance at the catastrophe, then
  seized the howdah rail. He almost flung himself over the elephant's
  rump&mdash;a whirl of naked legs and lurid tartan. But he caught its tail. He
  streamed out like a flying devil cast forth from a monster's flaming
  entrails. Then he let go suddenly, fell feet first, tumbled backwards, did a
  perfect somersault and landed on the radiator of the Ford.</p>

  <p>"So that's that," said the babu. "Where is Hawkesey? Damn you, where is
  Hawkesey? There is nothing else I want to know, so shut up and say where he
  is!" Then he remembered he was talking English. He repeated the question,
  using the vernacular, bringing the car to a standstill by the narrow
  sidewalk. "Where did you leave Hawkesey?"</p>

  <p>Copeland got out, carrying his handbag. He could see the elephant
  embattled with the goddess Kali; he was tusking at her float and overturning
  it, while mortally indignant priests engaged him with their sharp sticks and
  the sacred oxen milled in only half-awakened panic. Heroism had the
  priesthood by the shoulders that day; they stood up to the elephant, prodded
  him and beat him on the trunk. And heroism, as it usually does, caught on,
  assuming curious disguises. Someone on the sidewalk brilliantly, instantly,
  decided the mahout was guilty. Fury lent him strength. He tore up a
  cobblestone, flung it and hit the mahout. It brained him. The mahout fell
  down beneath his charge's feet; and, having nobody to interfere with natural
  behavior then, the elephant screamed a last defiance&mdash;and departed
  up-street, scattering the sacred oxen. There were lots of cobblestones.
  Innumerable heroes tore them up and buried the mahout, a broken mess of blood
  and bones, beneath a mid-street cairn.</p>

  <p>"The Rajah's elephant" yelled someone.</p>

  <p>No priest offering to stop that dangerous assertion of a plain truth,
  tumult took it up and tossed it to the roofs, where women yelled it to and
  fro until a quarter of a city knew the Rajah had deliberately sent an
  elephant to wreck the chariot of Kali. The remainder of the city, pardonably
  swift to magnify a rumor, took to cover and put up shutters, shouting that
  machine-guns, manned by the Rajah's sepoys, had begun a massacre. And
  Copeland, with his coat off, set a leg or two and bound up bruises that
  miraculously were the only irreligious damage that the elephant had done.
  (They were covering Kali's fallen image with a huge sheet, to await the
  privacy of darkness.)</p>

  <p>In the Ford car, on the front seat, fat babu and slender villager engaged
  in argument.</p>

  <p>"But you said you could use me. Therefore do it. I will tell you nothing,"
  said the villager, "until your honor guarantees employment. I will prove to
  you then what a father and mother of brains your servant is. I am a good one.
  Write me on the roll and pay me."</p>

  <p>"I will kick you in the teeth unless you answer!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I have a new knife. See it. I remember now that Hawkesey said I am
  to have his overcoat. But that is in the howdah, and the elephant is spilling
  things, so probably the priests will take it."</p>

  <p>"I will take you to the <i>kana</i>," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay! That is where the constabeels are. I have had enough of that
  tribe."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, tell me, where is Hawkesey?"</p>

  <p>"How, do I know? Am I God that I should know it? All I know is that a
  constabeel accused him on the way of having slain that other plainclothes
  constabeel, who tried to slay your honor when I saved your honor in the
  darkness. Lo, they had the body with them and they would have taken Hawkesey
  to the <i>kana</i>; but I told them priests had done it, so they let us
  continue our journey. And Hawkesey promised me the overcoat."</p>

  <p>"And then what?"</p>

  <p>"Why, later we came to the river. But the elephant would not swim the
  river, though I took him by the trunk and tried to make him do it."</p>

  <p>"Did you push him?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I did. I pushed him in. But out he came again, the coward. And
  then Hawkesey rode off looking for a bridge, although I warned him that the
  jungle gods would not approve of it."</p>

  <p>"Did you ride with him?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"Nay, not I! I went and did a little <i>puja</i>* to the gods, to keep the
  devils from deviling Hawkesey. I made a little image of an elephant, of mud.
  It took a long time, because I wanted no mistake about it; it must not be
  like a cow, or like a horse, or like a common elephant. It must resemble that
  one. As I say, it took a long time. So the devils got Hawkesey."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>puja, pooja</i>&mdash;in Hinduism or Buddhism, the
  ritual daily devotion involving offering food, drink and prayers to a deity.
  For more information see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja">Puja</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>"It was the fault of the mud. It was too wet. I had finished the elephant
  and set a little fire in front of him. And I had finished the mahout and set
  him on the beast's neck. So both of them were all right. But when I started
  the image of Hawkesey, gun and all, the wet mud would not stick together. And
  before I knew it, back they came, the elephant and the mahout, with no less
  than a thousand devils chasing them&mdash;although they had no need to fear
  the devils, because that part of the <i>puja</i> was attended to."</p>

  <p>"And Hawkesey?"</p>

  <p>"The mahout said that a tiger got him."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he was telling the truth?" the babu asked.</p>

  <p>"No. All mahouts are liars. That one lies dead yonder, doubtless because
  of the lies he told."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you think he was telling the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Because he waited at the ford for Hawkesey. He pretended that his
  elephant was weary. But I know, by the way he sat all night and watched, that
  he expected Hawkesey to come any minute. What I think is that the devils
  tempted Hawkesey far into the jungle, and that is the last you will ever hear
  of him. They could not tempt the elephant and the mahout, because I had
  finished their part of the <i>puja</i>. However, Hawkesey had promised me the
  overcoat. Undoubtedly that elephant has run back to the lines, so I had
  better go now and claim the overcoat before some rascal steals it."</p>

  <p>"I will find it for you," said the babu. "Get into the back seat." Then he
  shouted in English to Copeland: "Doctor sahib! Do you stop a forest fire by
  putting out the match that lighted it? You are a reincarnation of
  Nero&mdash;you are setting legs while Rome burns! Incidentally you rob the
  local leeches of a fat fee! You will hear from the Union!"</p>

  <p>But Copeland was already face to face with that. He had been violently
  shoved away from one case. Two good splints that he had improvised with
  commandeered umbrellas had been pulled off and the bandages, made from the
  victim's turban, had been thrown into the gutter. Men of the victim's own
  sub-caste had carried him away for treatment by a ritually clean incompetent;
  and other victims, not yet carried off, were calling to their friends to come
  and rescue them before the foreigner could touch them with pollution.</p>

  <p>"Oh, to hell with them!" said Copeland. "How can you help such fools?" He
  climbed into the front seat, pitched his bag beside the villager and reached
  into his pocket for tobacco. "Where now? Who's your new friend?"</p>

  <p>"To the palace," the babu answered. "And the son of untruth on the back
  seat is the guide who is to lead you into mischief. Luckily you can't talk to
  each other; there will be trouble enough without that!"</p>

  <p>He began to drive as furiously as the flat tires let him, taking short
  cuts through the crowded, winding streets towards the central rectangular
  part of the city. There was mob-rule in the making&mdash;leaderless as yet,
  but ominous enough to terrify the police, who were conspicuous by their
  absence; they had concentrated on the <i>kana</i>, where they awaited orders
  from the palace. Popular resentment at the outrage to the image of the
  goddess took its customary way of raging against anything foreign and
  anything modern. Cobblestones and vegetables pursued the Ford, shattered the
  lamps and windshield, struck the occupants; but Copeland's helmet and the
  babu's turban saved their heads from injury, and nobody was hurt except the
  villager&mdash;and he not badly; he bled at the nose and wiped it on the
  blanket with an air of having suffered far worse inconvenience without the
  compensating fun of being driven, gratis, by a babu in a rich man's chariot.
  It was not until Copeland forced him, that he lay down on the car floor and
  protected himself with Copeland's bedding-roll and suitcase.</p>

  <p>But the worst came in the great square, where the palace sepoys, hurriedly
  reinforced from the barracks had been lined up two deep to protect the gilded
  iron railing and the great gate. Their commanding officer looked fierce
  enough to eat his own revolver, and the bearded sepoys&mdash;bayonets already
  fixed&mdash;were in the nervous state that leads to massacre or rout,
  whichever accident determines, or whichever the leader's nerves may set in
  motion. Swarming in the square, the hoarse crowd yelled and imprecated,
  fearful of the bayonets and perfectly aware that one word might direct a
  volley into them, but urged on from the rear, where bullets were less likely
  to reach loud-lunged agitators and the streets offered ready escape. Copeland
  advised discretion:</p>

  <p>"Isn't there a back door to the palace, if you feel you have to go
  there?"</p>

  <p>But the babu glanced up at the lowering sky and shouted back, between the
  honkings of his horn: "There is a time for meekness and a time for being
  insolent. I think, too, that the gods will save these imbeciles!"</p>

  <p>He honked into the crowd. It made way. At the top of his lungs he shouted:
  "From the Residency! Let pass someone from the Residency!"</p>

  <p>That bluff worked for half a minute. A lane widened. But the sweaty faces
  glowered. Teeth flashed. Eyes glared. And then someone shouted <i>Bande
  Mataram!</i>&mdash;Hail Motherland!&mdash;the war-cry of the
  self-determinists who want an end in India of all things British, influence
  in Native States included. Someone with a long stick struck at Copeland's
  helmet and the officer on horseback at the great gate saw it. He shouted. He
  drew his saber. He turned in the saddle to bark a command at his men. The
  babu gave the engine all the gas he dared, and above the din of
  that&mdash;above the mob-yell&mdash;sudden as a thunder-clap&mdash;a volley
  from a hundred rifles ripped into the air above the crowd's heads. Then the
  gods got busy.</p>

  <p>"Thought so!" said the babu.</p>

  <p>Down came the rain. It was as if the bullets had shattered a firmament. A
  deluge, driven by a gusty wind, smote slanting in the faces of the crowd and
  scattered them as if their angry gods had opened on them with artillery. The
  lightning sizzled through the rain. It thundered. And in sixty seconds one
  whole company of drenched, but relieved and scornful sepoys stared across a
  streaming pavement at a solitary, flat-tired, battered Ford that skidded
  crazily towards them, honking for the gate to open.</p>

  <p>"Quick! Am I a fish?" Chullunder Ghose asked.</p>

  <p>The commanding officer, proud on his high horse, but peevish because the
  rain was pouring down his neck and chilling his spinal column, rammed his
  saber back into the scabbard and motioned the babu away with the flat of his
  hand. He ignored Copeland. To explain about that volley would be trouble
  enough without adding to it by an altercation with a foreigner.</p>

  <p>"I bring a doctor for His Highness," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of an illness."</p>

  <p>"Does the Rajah have to ask you for permission to be sick?" Chullunder
  Ghose retorted. "Do you think your haughty ignorance will save him from a
  death-bed?"</p>

  <p>"Go away, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, stick that saber into me and take the consequences! Or
  command a volley! One more like the last one should improve the Rajah's
  headache! It should sweeten His Highness' temper!"</p>

  <p>"Where is your authority?"</p>

  <p>"Where yours is&mdash;under a wet towel in the Rajah's bedroom! And the
  towel will catch fire unless they change it very frequently! Already I am
  late. But I would rather be me than you when I have told who kept me
  waiting!"</p>

  <p>The commanding officer decided, ungraciously, on a middle course. He faced
  about and ordered two men to mount the running-boards and go with the Ford to
  the front door.</p>

  <p>"Then, if they are not admitted, bring them back to me and I will show
  them the guard-room door from the inside."</p>

  <p>The gate swung open and Chullunder Ghose drove honking round the drive to
  the pretentious portico, where insolent retainers lolled in heavy overcoats
  and scowled at such an insult as a Ford car.</p>

  <p>"Tradesmen to the back door!"</p>

  <p>The sepoy escort took their cue and ordered the babu to drive on. But he
  stopped the engine and was out on the palace steps too quickly for them.</p>

  <p>"Idiots! Did you hear that shooting? I am from the Residency. Go and tell
  His Highness that unless he sees me instantly a telegram will be sent to
  British-India for troops to quell the insurrection!"</p>

  <p>Even palace flunkies understood the dire significance of that threat. The
  arrival of a single company of British infantry would mean political
  extinction as a State&mdash;and that would mean the end of perquisites.
  Another differently sordid crew of bureaucratic thieves would govern. So a
  man fled up-steps and the babu followed, placidly ignoring the command to
  wait. He followed through the front door; he was too heavy and powerful for
  the attendant to slam it shut in his face.</p>

  <p>"You forgot me!" he said with a grin. "I am the broker, not the
  moneylender! Kiss yourself on both cheeks with the compliments of Mother
  Kali!"</p>

  <p>But the impetus of impudence was almost spent by that time, and they kept
  him waiting in the hall. He gave his name to the attendant. Three
  inhospitable looking stalwarts stood and glowered at him, while another
  vanished to inform the Rajah who it was that dared to crave an audience.
  Their ominous scowling made the babu nervous; he was suffering reaction from
  his own enthusiasm, and the longer he waited the worse he became &mdash;
  until the chimes of a grandfather clock nearly startled him out of his skin.
  It was high noon. He compared the time by his wrist-watch&mdash;set the
  wrist-watch.</p>

  <p>"Mid-day&mdash;mid-monsoon&mdash;<i>in media res</i>&mdash;we lay our
  bets&mdash;<i>fortuna insolente ludit</i>&mdash;God proposes, man
  forgets&mdash;and then <i>calamitas intrudit!</i>&mdash;I forget my Latin.
  What the devil else have I forgotten? Oh yes&mdash;that the wind is tempered
  to the shorn lamb&mdash;let us hope so. Let us hope, too, that the scissors
  shear well!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly and very rudely he was beckoned to the Rajah's presence by a man
  whose servile nature parroted his master's mood. He even parroted the
  silence&mdash;imitated the sneer and the nod of the autocratic head that had
  assented to the babu being haled into the presence. Down a corridor as gloomy
  as a morgue, with mildewed tapestry, the babu followed the attendant to a
  room that the Rajah described as his office. It was very plainly furnished
  and reserved for visitors whose social standing was of much less note than
  their importance. On the wall that faced the plain oak desk there was a
  portrait of Queen Victoria, bearing her autograph. It had been made in one of
  her less amiable moments, and a small crown, at a saucy angle, indicated that
  she knew her onions, although she might have been offended at the phrase.</p>

  <p>"You swag-bellied scoundrel! What do you want of me?" the Rajah asked.</p>

  <p>"Magnificence, I need an elephant." With his hands to his forehead, the
  babu bowed as meekly as a tradesman asking ten times what a jewel for the
  last new favorite was worth.</p>

  <p>The Rajah struck the desk. "May devils with a set of jaws at both ends
  bite you in the liver," he exploded. "If I had a thousand elephants, you
  shouldn't have one."</p>

  <p>"But the thousand-and-first? I beg the Presence to begin to count at that
  end."</p>

  <p>"I will gladly count a dozen that shall tread you into food for rats, if
  you will only go and lie down in the mud where you belong!"</p>

  <p>"But if the priests should let me have an elephant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pah! Try them!"</p>

  <p>"I should need to persuade them, no doubt, by informing them of what I
  know."</p>

  <p>"Eh? What? You rotten spy! And what do you propose to tell them?"</p>

  <p>"It would need to be something serious," said the babu, "since they know
  so much already. All I need is just one elephant, for one week&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Week? You raging imbecile! I tell you, not for one hour!"</p>

  <p>The Rajah opened the middle drawer of the desk. He drew out a revolver, a
  little beauty, all mother-of-pearl and nickel-plate. Then he rested his elbow
  on the desk and covered the babu, glaring at him.</p>

  <p>"Now them Tell me why you're here, and what you think you know, or go out
  down the main drain!"</p>

  <p>"Did the main drain swallow Syed-Suraj? I am sure Your Highness would have
  shot me first thing, if it were not risky. Did the main drain swallow all
  Your Highness' slightly rash remarks about the British? It is said that
  others than the priests have overheard them. It is said, too, that Your
  Highness' cousin's health is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With the butt of the revolver on the desk the Rajah dinned him into
  silence.</p>

  <p>"They accuse me, do they? And is that what brought you to Kutchdullub? You
  abominable traitor, are, you sent to inform against me, and to find an excuse
  for getting rid of me in order to enthrone my cousin?"</p>

  <p>"Is the Presence dreaming?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"Tell me why you want that elephant."</p>

  <p>"To save your Honor's honor!"</p>

  <p>"What the devil&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"If the Presence will believe a desperately hurried babu, I am sent to do
  the diametrically opposite of what the Presence honors me by hinting that I
  might be trusted to attempt! A little meditation might convince Your Highness
  that the British Raj, if it should wish to bring about your abdication, would
  hardly entrust that task to such a person as myself."</p>

  <p>"You lie, you fat hog!"</p>

  <p>"If I should reveal a secret, will the Presence not betray me?"</p>

  <p>"I will blow your brains out, unless you tell me all you know, you
  viper!"</p>

  <p>"Then I must tell. You are murdering your cousin. You have murdered
  Syed-Suraj. By refusing to destroy a tiger you have murdered many of your
  subjects, for the sake of making a dilemma for the priests. I am afraid that
  you have sent my good friend Hawkesey to his death. And you have tried to
  murder me. But I am sent to save a scandal."</p>

  <p>The Rajah grinned. "And you propose to do it? How?" He tapped the desk
  with the revolver.</p>

  <p>"I intend to send a doctor to your cousin. That is why I need an
  elephant."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"As Your Highness shrewdly said, I am a viper. I forgive the attempt to
  have me murdered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you? You slew one of my men!" said the Rajah. "It was no doubt you who
  told a villager to say a priest had done it. You shall hang for that as
  surely as I sit here!"</p>

  <p>"But unless you promise me," the babu went on, pointing an accusing
  finger, "and unless you keep the promise, to attempt to save the life of my
  friend Hawkesey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then what?"</p>

  <p>"Then what? Damn you, I will let the priests win! I will let you abdicate!
  And you shall die in prison in the Andamans, where they will neither give you
  champagne nor expensive women! Shoot me&mdash;go on, shoot me! I am
  unimportant. I am only the one person who can save you from enforced
  abdication!"</p>

  <p>"Curses on your black soul!" said the Rajah.</p>

  <p>"If I thought I could trust you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can't! You can't trust anyone," the babu answered. "My employers
  trust me. That is all you can depend on. It is your luck that they don't want
  any scandal. They have sent me to preserve them from the bad embarrassment of
  forcing you to abdicate, at this time when political strain is too severe
  already. You can no more trust me than I trust you. But you can use your
  judgment. Have the whisky and the women left you any?"</p>

  <p>"Damn you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do I get the elephant?"</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"Now!"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you are for me, not against me?"</p>

  <p>"I am dead against you! But I have my orders to save you from the
  Andamans. Do I get he elephant?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Give the order."</p>

  <p>"Presently. About Hawkes? What do you wish done about him?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you about Hawkesey when the elephant is at the front
  door."</p>

  <p>"You annoy me," said the Rajah. "I advise you, it is dangerous to do
  that."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" asked the babu, bulging out his stomach. "Let me tell you then,
  that I am fat from too much danger that has never happened! It is you who are
  in danger. I would rather see you dead than prosperous, so hurry up! Unless I
  have an elephant in fifteen minutes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Twenty," the Rajah answered. With an air of bitter resignation he
  returned the nickel-plated weapon to the drawer. "It will take them all of
  twenty minutes to get him saddled. Wait here."</p>

  <p>"While you shoot the doctor? It will take me twenty minutes to instruct
  him," said the babu. "It is not so simple as, perhaps, you think, to save
  your face and keep my conscience at the same time! Let us hope you have no
  conscience; that may save your Presence from the horror of repentance at the
  end!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER 14</a><br>
  "We nibblers at the thread say nothing"</h2>

  <p class="first">BEHIND Hawkes was the light from the fire he had built. He
  also held a flashlight that exactly indicated where he was, although it also
  aided him as long as he kept it switched on. It showed him a hole in the
  wall, down which the inscrutable woman slid, heels first; and it showed him
  her head at the foot of the hole, when she landed on something firm and
  waited for him. But he switched it off then, in order to spare one hand for
  his rifle and the other for groping. He could slide in the dark, and he did.
  But when he switched it on again before reaching the bottom it made him a
  mark for any one who might be lying in wait for him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, then, he remembered he was naked from the waist up&mdash;no
  spare ammunition; all the extra shells were in the pocket of his coat that
  was waiting its turn to be dried at the fire. His curiosity, or possibly the
  woman's weird appearance, or her magnetism, whatever that is, had obliterated
  caution. He cursed himself and instantly decided to climb back, to get his
  coat and reconsider tactics. A bat in his face increased his eagerness. He
  directed his flashlight up the hole&mdash;and felt his feet seized from
  beneath him.</p>

  <p>He had carried his rifle muzzle-upward, to protect the sight, and from
  habit, and because the butt might come in handy to provide a purchase on the
  rough wall. Now there was no room to turn the weapon end for end; it was as
  useless as a protest in an earthquake. Worse, it occupied his right hand. And
  he clutched at his watch with his left hand&mdash;that precious watch that he
  kept in the padded, buttoned pocket underneath his belt. So he dropped the
  flashlight, heard it clatter downward, and the next he knew its rays were
  focused on him.</p>

  <p>He was jerked out from the hole so violently that he was almost stunned
  when his head struck masonry; but he hung on to the rifle and his thumb
  snapped off the safety catch as automatically as his other hand had gone to
  the protection of the watch. He could see nothing except his flashlight
  pointed at him. He was lying in a pool of white light on a black
  floor&mdash;onyx&mdash;black marble&mdash;something smooth and slippery; and
  he discovered that his feet were in a noose. He sat up suddenly to aim his
  rifle at the flashlight, and was equally suddenly jerked to his back again.
  Someone snatched his rifle then and twisted it out of his grip. Whoever that
  was, whispered:</p>

  <p>"Sorry to be so rough, sahib&mdash;take it easy!'" Good plain English! But
  the noose around his feet was plainer than a hint too. So was the butt of his
  own beloved .577, poised in the path of the flashlight, over his nose and
  near enough to explain exactly what it meant. He saw now that the woman held
  the flashlight; but the rope that held his feet went taut into the dark
  beyond her.</p>

  <p>Pride has its very peculiar way with individuals, no two reacting quite
  alike. It made Hawkes silent. It was pride in his own resourcefulness that
  told him, if he said nothing and did nothing, surprising opportunity would
  offer him the upper hand in due time. Why waste effort? Why not fool the
  adversary, meanwhile, with a show of sulky submission? He lay still, hoping
  his hands would escape being tied. But that was a vain hope.</p>

  <p>He who held the rifle set a lean knee on his neck and pinned him to the
  hard floor, forcing him to writhe to one side to avoid suffocation. He raised
  his hands to strike at the knee, or to seize and twist it. Both hands were
  instantly caught and drawn tight in another noose. The pressure on his neck
  ceased, but his hands were pulled over his head and he lay stretched like a
  felon awaiting the rack. It was a very neat job; even Hawkes admitted that.
  He was as angry as a noosed gorilla, and about as likely to forgive his
  assailants, but he was curious too. He had bumped his head, but why in
  thunder had they been so thoughtful not to hurt him worse than that? And why
  the devil did the woman stand there saying nothing?</p>

  <p>He began to be drawn, on his back, by the feet. Whoever had charge of his
  hands kept that rope taut enough to make struggling useless. As he passed the
  woman she spat on him. Suddenly, then, the torch was snatched out of the
  woman's hand and switched off. He heard a blow that sounded as if the woman's
  arm had struck someone, and he heard a knife go slithering along the floor.
  After that he was dragged in great haste, scraped around a corner, down some
  steps, where the man behind him raised him by the shoulders, presumably to
  save him from being skinned on the stone treads, and then carried by two men
  through a door. He heard it slam behind him.</p>

  <p>"Sahib," said a voice, "we thank you in the name of our employer."</p>

  <p>"What for?" Sullenness was melted by astonishment; Hawkes could not keep
  his tongue still.</p>

  <p>"That you let us avoid the wrath of our employer."</p>

  <p>"Who's he?"</p>

  <p>"He insisted we are not to hurt you. Did we?"</p>

  <p>"Damn your eyes, who is he?"</p>

  <p>"But he ordered us to seem to be your honor's enemies, in order that your
  honor may assist us."</p>

  <p>"Turn a light on!"</p>

  <p>"But we are to warn your honor not to use the rifle&mdash;not yet."</p>

  <p>"Strike a light, I tell you! Let me up, God dammit!"</p>

  <p>"Babu Chullunder Ghose said also that your honor is depended on to listen
  to us two and not be angry with us."</p>

  <p>"What's his number?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"C.3."</p>

  <p>"What's yours?"</p>

  <p>"We are F.11 and F.15."</p>

  <p>"O.K., I'll listen to you. Dammit, if you've hurt my rifle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take it, sahib. It is unhurt."</p>

  <p>The spokesman switched on the flashlight that he had snatched from the
  woman in passing. He grinned.</p>

  <p>"She had a knife under her goatskin, but I knew it. Slash your throat and
  feed you to the tiger too soon&mdash;that was her idea. But I tricked her.
  And now I shall have to persuade her all over again."</p>

  <p>Hawkes stood up, kicking his feet free from the noose. He examined his
  rifle.</p>

  <p>"What the hell d'you mean by too soon?" he demanded. Then he stared at two
  men dressed in yellow smocks, their hair a mess of yellow clay. They looked
  like religious pilgrims; on their foreheads were the yellow-ocher signature
  of Kali's chosen. They were worshipers of Death, if signs meant anything. One
  of the men was lighting a hurricane lamp in a corner. He was using Swedish
  safety matches. As soon as the lamp was properly alight the other man
  switched off the flashlight.</p>

  <p>"Let us save that. We shall need it. She&mdash;that woman&mdash;knows you
  are the Rajah's agent. She supposes you have come to kill her tiger. She
  would have knifed you if we hadn't coaxed her to reserve you for a special
  offering to Kali. We persuaded her that there would certainly be trouble
  unless the tiger kills you in the open and it looks like accident. And we
  agreed to tie you, and then loose you in the tiger's way some evening. But
  you see what she is; she can't wait. She's a bad one."</p>

  <p>"Why not noose her then, the same as you did me?" Hawkes asked him. "Drag
  her to Kutchdullub. Chuck her in the clink. I'll interview her tiger. Let me
  get my eye on him at fifty or a hundred&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steady, sahib! He who sent us is an artful person. If we take this woman
  to the <i>kana</i>, who can prove anything against her? But it will prove to
  the priests that we are their enemies; and the priests will prove it to the
  people, who will riot. One priest is a better liar than a hundred lawyers,
  and a lawyer is no duffer at it, God knows. They will turn lies loose against
  us like a swarm of hornets. And the worst is, they will say the British have
  a hand in it. They will say that the British are aiming plots at their
  religion, we being men of the C.I.D., which is a British agency. It would be
  true; and the truth is deadly dangerous, except as one friend to
  another."</p>

  <p>Hawkes stared at the fellow's straight nose and at his hungry, fierce
  eyes; they were fierce with savage laughter.</p>

  <p>"If you couldn't see a joke, you'd be a damned keen killer on your own
  hook, I'll bet! What's the game now?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, wait for C.3. He and we are mice that nibble at the thread by
  which a sword is hanging over someone."</p>

  <p>"Politics, eh?" Hawkes scorned the word; he never used it except as an
  insult.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib, not so. Politics is talk, of which there is already too much.
  Is a politician he who lets the pythons strangle one another? Nay, a
  politician seeks the stronger side. Then he robs both the loser and winner
  and says: 'Behold me, what a paragon I am!' But we&mdash;we nibblers at the
  thread&mdash;say nothing, and rob no one."</p>

  <p>"I can't wait here," Hawkes said savagely. He hated mysteries. He had a
  .577 that he felt could easily solve this one. "C.3 wanted me to find out how
  they get a man-killer to come back when they call him. I'm to go to
  Kutchdullub and tell him. How's it managed?"</p>

  <p>"We will show you, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Any priests here?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"No, not priests, but devotees, such as we are supposed to become when the
  spirit overcomes and overwhelms us. Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered sulkily. He did not wish to understand it. But as
  thieves delight in teaching thieves, and scientists delight in teaching
  scientists, the C.I.D. exists because its members passionately love their art
  and teach it, as it might be music, to whoever has the O.K. of a master of
  their guild.</p>

  <p>"It is the same as Thuggee, sahib. Thuggee never died out. It was a
  religion. A religion never dies, although, it can be changed into another
  form. So when the British set the C.I.D. to wipe out Thuggee; and its
  devotees, who slew by stealth for the sake of slaying, saw the shadow of the
  gallows&mdash;and the slayers, though they love death, love not that death;
  then they had to seek another way of worship. So they sought this. And it is
  also like the death beneath the wheels of juggernaut. And it is also like the
  death by <i>suttee</i>.* Only this is far more dreadful."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>suttee</i>&mdash;the now illegal practice of a
  Hindu widow cremating herself on her husband's funeral pyre in order to
  fulfill her true role as wife; a widow who commits such an act. <i><a href=

  Dictionary</a></i>. For more information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_%28practice%29">Sati
  (practice)</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"And they like it dreadful?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"Drama, sahib! They are unlike the little weaklings, who go in gangs and
  flatter one another. They are like lone criminals, on whom a spirit of crime
  has cast its shadow; or like great conquerors, on whom the breath of war has
  breathed. They achieve aloofness and aloneness. And the drama they devise is
  for themselves alone. It is not crime or conquest that they serve&mdash;or
  profit; and it is not fame they seek&mdash;or justice. Neither is it pride.
  And they are not mad&mdash;not as common madmen are. They see crime, or they
  see death as a drama; and themselves its climax. Slay&mdash;then be slain; it
  is all one."</p>

  <p>"They may kill 'emselves for all of me," said Hawkes.</p>

  <p>"And why not, sahib? But a man must understand them if he hopes to serve
  the C.I.D. and grapple with the brainy ones who turn such drama to their own
  ends."</p>

  <p>Hawkes spat. He reached for his pipe and tobacco&mdash;remembered again
  that he had no coat on&mdash;swore irritably. Then he answered:</p>

  <p>"Out o' my line. I'm not C.I.D. I never would be. I like give and take
  above the bellyband. To hell with sneaking in and out o' holes."</p>

  <p>"But if the secrets are in holes? You shall look at this one, sahib."</p>

  <p>F.11 signed to F.15, who took the lantern and led downwards into smelly
  darkness, by a flight of stone steps in the thickness of a wall whose seams
  not even an earthquake had been able to enlarge. The darkness stank. There
  was a silence that not even Hawkes' boots could shatter with Fusilier tramp
  on the masonry.</p>

  <p>"Where's that woman?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"You shall see her, sahib. I must tie your hands now. Even in the darkness
  that is better; one might come and feel you."</p>

  <p>No less suddenly than Thugs were used to whip their scarf around the
  throats of victims, F.11 noosed Hawkes' arms. F.15 had snatched the rifle
  from his hand and he was pinioned like a gallows bird before he could start
  to resist.</p>

  <p>"It must not be forgotten, sahib, that a death awaits your honor! It is by
  your honor's death that we two may achieve the ecstasy that shall prepare us
  also for the embrace of Kali!"</p>

  <p>Sullen silence fell on Hawkes again. He could have kicked and done some
  damage, but not enough to make the offense worth while. So he grinned while
  he gritted his teeth; he had had enough of indignities and somebody would
  pay&mdash;unless &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Are these blokes fooling me?" he wondered. "They could have learned those
  numbers&mdash;easy. Am I for it?" He could feel the goose-flesh rising on his
  bare skin; and the stench of a charnel-house sickened him. "Chullunder Ghose
  said nothing about these men. Why, I wonder? Maybe they've been spying on
  him, that's what!" He began to think about his mother and his sisters.
  "Dole!" How he hated the word.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER 15</a><br>
  "Not yet!"</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a goatskin on a shelf of masonry. It was sewn like
  an enormous short sleeve. F.15 used it to cover the lantern, and then it was
  pitch dark except for the blood-colored glow on his knuckles where the bail
  just topped the goatskin. So it felt like following a dead man's hand into
  the morgue at midnight. Or a graveyard. Or a pit where paupers' corpses lie
  awaiting God's worms.</p>

  <p>The abominable stench grew sharper as a passage curved round the roots of
  broken columns, amid debris over which Hawkes stumbled. There was only a
  glimpse now and then of a column lying prone beneath the wreck of a colossal
  roof&mdash;until the glimpses presently became a dim reality, and suddenly
  the passage opened on a segment of gallery, on which about a dozen tiny clay
  lamps flickered. There had been a balustrade round the gallery, but that had
  fallen. Perched round the edge, beside the little lamps, sat humans, chins on
  knees, like vultures at a Parsee charnel-tower. And the stench came upward,
  from a darkness that suggested death made solid. The little grease-fed, smoky
  flames round the gallery resembled yellow tongues that sought to slake
  undying thirst.</p>

  <p>The human vultures glanced uneasily, as vultures on a roof do, at the
  sound of Hawkes's boots on the masonry. Then they resumed their vigil,
  staring downward. F.11 whispered, so Hawkes sat between him and F.15, with
  his legs tucked under him; but they sat like the others, chin on knees, with
  their arms round their shins. The gallery was only three feet wide; Hawkes
  set his back against the wall and shuddered. It would be a lot too easy for
  his guides to seize him, one on either hand, and shove him over. He could
  almost feel himself go. He shut his eyes&mdash;then opened them and forced
  himself to stare into the dark, polluted silence.</p>

  <p>Then he saw eyes. They were green. They were not, they were red &mdash;
  no, green&mdash;no, one was green and one red. They were both green. They
  were moving. Up and down a trifle; then from side to side and back
  again&mdash;as much as twenty feet each way&mdash;faster and then slower.
  They were deep down somewhere, and no guessing how near&mdash;fifty&mdash;a
  hundred&mdash;a hundred and fifty feet away&mdash;no, fifty. And they seemed
  to be in mid-air. But they were too big for a bird's eyes; and never a bird
  flew as that one did. They were enormous. No, they were not; they were
  yellow, and they shrank. They were two of the lamp-fires mirrored on stagnant
  water. But they vanished. And there they were again as big as ever, moving
  sideways, emerald&mdash;then blue-green. Much more swiftly they were
  moving.</p>

  <p>Silence split so suddenly that Hawkes's heart checked, then hammered on
  his ribs. It was neither a growl, nor a whine, nor a snarl, but all three,
  ending in a harsh cough.</p>

  <p>"Tiger!"</p>

  <p>Now he recognized them; tiger's eyes, weird in darkness, made that way by
  nature to confuse all others. And it was easier to guess, now that he knew
  what they were. They were thirty feet down, and twice that much distant,
  moving to and fro behind a barrier of some sort, but he could only imagine
  the barrier. They were catching the light from the tiny clay lamps and
  reflecting it.</p>

  <p>In the gruesome stillness Hawkes suddenly heard a footfall. It was
  heavy&mdash;careless; something rolled away as if kicked. It sounded unlike
  stone. And then there was light&mdash;a little blaze of tinder, leaping into
  crimson as a resinous torch caught fire. It was the woman. She was perched on
  a broken column, seated slightly above Hawkes's level, to one side of a
  circular pit, whose roof consisted of a mass of fallen masonry supported by
  its own dead weight against surrounding walls. She shook her torch. Amid the
  leaping shadows, thirty feet beneath him, as he stared, Hawkes saw human
  ribs, skulls, thigh-bones, scattered amid fallen debris&mdash;then a tiger
  and tigress, she behind a barrier of upright stone bars, rubbing herself
  against them, as if fawning on the male. He stood as close as he could get to
  her, magnificent and startled, staring up at the torch. He blinked at the
  light. He snarled and showed his eye-teeth. His tail twitched in and out of
  shadow. He crouched. He slunk away towards the dark mouth of a tunnel &mdash;
  turned round a shapeless heap of masonry and changed his mind&mdash;turned
  back again and stared up at the broken gallery&mdash;then coughed and sprang
  like lightning at the column on which the woman sat. His leap fell short of
  her by twenty feet. He tried it three times. Then he slunk back to the
  tigress, who was frantic; she was flowing back and forth behind the stone
  bars like a shadow with emerald eyes.</p>

  <p>No one had moved, stirred, spoken. On the segment of the broken gallery
  that solemn audience sat still like vultures that await death. Whose? Hawkes
  struggled to release his arms, but F.11 heard him and whispered:</p>

  <p>"Not yet!"</p>

  <p>Then Hawkes pressed his back against the wall so hard that it tortured his
  pinioned elbows; but the pain was better than the too near edge of that
  rail-less gallery. When F.11 moved a little closer to him he set his
  teeth&mdash;shrank. Pride would not let him cry out, but he felt already the
  appalling vertigo of falling into dark space. He began to pray for guts with
  which to face it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the blood came coursing through his veins again like an electric
  current. Sound as vibrant as a file on brass so struck the silence that it
  seemed to make the very silence throb with anger. It was the hag. She was
  singing. And never in battle, nor in the ambulances where the stricken
  screech their greeting to the jaws of hell, nor in the jungle, when the
  python steals on victims in the night, had Hawkes heard such a paean to the
  gods of horror. Agony was in it, and the utter emptiness of hunger for the
  ultimate of nothing&mdash;and the knowledge that the hunger, too, was
  nothing, and the agony of the nothingness of hunger in a void that had no end
  and no beginning&mdash;an eternity that was not, is not, never will be. And
  the human vultures in a row round the ledge, between the little yellow
  lamp-flames, chanted flat, monotonous responses to her litany of death.</p>

  <p>It ended in a silence in which nothing stirred except a skull that rolled
  out of shadow where the tiger's eyes shone in the torchlight. Then the hag
  struck a gong and the tiger crept into view, as if he knew that signal. Some
  one at the far end of the gallery&mdash;without a word or gesture that
  betrayed emotion&mdash;set his thumb deliberately on the little flame beside
  him, stood up leisurely as if he yawned at what was coming, raised both arms
  above his head, swayed slowly and then, soundless, let himself go, feet
  first, down into the dark pit.</p>

  <p>He fell with a thud amid bones and debris. There was no other sound,
  except a slight one as he writhed in shadow. Hawker's pulse beat a hundred
  times before the tiger leaped like tawny lightning through the zone of
  torchlight. Then a guttural growl&mdash;thud&mdash;scrunch, as teeth went
  home into a man's neck. Silence&mdash;nothing&mdash;no emotion, except that
  the tigress, like a frantic green-eyed shadow, wove to and fro on a loom of
  longing in her dungeon behind the stone bars.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER 16</a><br>
  "I kiss feet, Heavenborn!"</h2>

  <p class="first">RAM DASS, dealer in grain and mortgages, was a gentleman
  whose hat was always in the ring. He had an enviable reputation as a good
  sport, who was easy on his debtors if the debtors played fair. But it was
  dangerous to "gyp" him. Having lent the Rajah five thousand rupees at
  usurious rates on an open note, at the request of Syed-Suraj, he was
  perfectly willing to wait for his enormous profit; but he did not choose to
  lose the money.</p>

  <p>And Chullunder Ghose had very deftly planted in the mind of Ram Dass more
  than a suspicion that the Rajah was in danger of losing his throne. On top of
  that came rumor&mdash;then the circumstantial story&mdash;and then proof that
  the Rajah had murdered Syed-Suraj in the course of a furious argument. The
  inquest, held immediately in the Rajah's library; the servants' version of
  what had happened; and the verdict&mdash;had deceived nobody, not even the
  presiding judge who acted coroner. The Rajah had not even honored the inquest
  with his presence, although rumor had it that he listened through the panel
  above the bookcase that had been used by the woman who actually saw the
  murder and reported it in detail to Chullunder Ghose's dish-faced spy.</p>

  <p>"If I must lose my money I will have a run for it," said Ram Dass to his
  head clerk. "Royalty may get away with murder, but the ones who do settle
  their debts! And besides, that babu didn't drop me hints for nothing. It was
  not for nothing that he told me how to get the elephant-feed contract. Not
  for nothing that he saved me from lending another five thousand. Not he! He
  does nothing for nothing. And he knows I play fair. What does he expect,
  then? He didn't say what he wants. But if I play my own game it will probably
  exactly fit his."</p>

  <p>He had none of the airs of the plutocrat. In spite of all his wealth he
  did not even own a carriage. Beneath a very cheap umbrella, and with a very
  ordinary cotton blanket swathed round his shoulders, he walked to the office
  of Ananda Raz, the Brahmin attorney. He was admitted instantly into the
  Brahmin's presence. And, being a sensible man, to whom another's dignity was
  equally important as his own, so long as it entailed no calculable loss or
  inconvenience to him, he started with the proper formula.</p>

  <p>"I kiss feet."</p>

  <p>So the Brahmin wheezed an asthmatic, equally perfunctory but inoffensive
  blessing and they sat down, studying each other with the guarded guile of men
  who thoroughly detest each other's morals but respect each other's business
  acumen.</p>

  <p>"Terrible weather," said Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>"Dreadful," agreed the Brahmin. "But the rain should give us good crops.
  Do you look for a low price for future rice deliveries?"</p>

  <p>"I look for God's will."</p>

  <p>"Such is wisdom," said the Brahmin.</p>

  <p>"As attorney to the temple trustees, you undoubtedly are more familiar
  with God's will than the rest of us," said Ram Dass. "Is it probable that
  changes of importance may occur soon?"</p>

  <p>"Of the weather?"</p>

  <p>"At the moment I was thinking more of ruined temples&mdash;and a
  tiger&mdash;and the funeral of Syed-Suraj," Ram Dass answered. "Is the
  Rajah's cousin's health improving?"</p>

  <p>"I have no news."</p>

  <p>"Is the sahib at the Residency well?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard he has boils," said the Brahmin. "And if that is true, he
  should be pitied. Boils are painful, and they who suffer from them usually
  lose their judgment along with their bodily vigor."</p>

  <p>That was an opening. Ram Dass rode straight at it, whip, spur and
  bridle.</p>

  <p>"Is he sick, or is he shamming? Are they diplomatic boils, and is he
  waiting on events, to see which way the priests&mdash;I mean the
  cats&mdash;jump, before he bets on one or other of them?"</p>

  <p>"Strictly between you and me, he is ill," said the Brahmin, "but it makes
  no difference. Such a person as he is always at the mercy of events, since he
  always looks backwards. If he does look forward, it is only to a dream of
  laziness. In consequence, a change inevitably sees him trying to resist
  it."</p>

  <p>"So you do think there will be a change?" asked Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>"Do I? And what sort of change?" the Brahmin answered.</p>

  <p>That seemed to be another opening, so Ram Dass tried again.</p>

  <p>"I am in favor of a change," he answered. "Did you hear the Rajah's sepoys
  fire a volley from the palace gate just now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. Nobody was hurt, however. It was a warning to the crowd to
  disperse."</p>

  <p>"I am in favor of the crowd," said Ram Dass. "I have heard that the Rajah
  sent an elephant to wreck the sacred image of the goddess Kali. Do the
  priests intend to overlook such sacrilege?" Ananda Raz knew perfectly that
  Ram Dass cared no more for Kali's image than he did for Confucius; he was
  simply talking to seduce the attorney's confidence. Ananda Raz, however, only
  wanted an excuse; he only dreaded to give an opinion that he could not,
  later, claim he had been justified in giving. So he yielded&mdash;let his
  temper get the better of him&mdash;wheezed as if someone had stolen a fat
  fee:</p>

  <p>"Sacrilege! Sacrilege! Now you have laid your finger on it! Murder we are
  used to! Insolence and personal defilement we have had to learn to tolerate!
  But show me proof that it was he who sent that cursed elephant to break up
  the procession through the streets, and I will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated for effect, and Ram Dass flattered him by a show of
  breathless interest:</p>

  <p>"Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"I will guarantee to have him replaced by his cousin within ten days!"
  said the Brahmin.</p>

  <p>"How then?"</p>

  <p>"I will bring on a rebellion! And I will get up an appeal for British
  troops! And I will sign up an association of his creditors!"</p>

  <p>He paused again. He stared hard. Then he pointed with his index finger.
  "Tell me, are you not his creditor?"</p>

  <p>At that Ram Dass unmasked his own artillery as blandly as a conjurer
  producing rabbits from a top-hat.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he retorted.</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"A concerted action by his creditors might force me to accept as little as
  a tenth of what he owes me. So, unless I get mine first, in full, you may
  depend on me to take his part in any serious trouble that may turn up!"</p>

  <p>"You astonish me!"</p>

  <p>"I know, too, that he owes you a lot of money," Ram Dass continued. "You
  expect to get it from his cousin, as the price of the priests' support, but
  you propose to make the other creditors accept a small percentage of their
  claims."</p>

  <p>"But I assure you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I need no assurance! As attorney for the temple trustees, you know that
  the priests have got themselves into a mess! They have a tiger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Prove it!" snapped the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"I don't need to. Tigers are their own proof! Are you such a fool as to
  suppose that an inquiry by the British won't involve the priesthood in a
  scandal that will clip their claws and break their teeth forever? That is why
  you sit still. You, as the attorney for the priesthood, are afraid to appeal
  to the British. So unless I get the money that the Rajah owes me, I am going
  to the Residency now to demand that the Resident wire for troops."</p>

  <p>"Then neither of us could collect the money that the Rajah owes us," said
  the Brahmin.</p>

  <p>"I can afford to lose mine," Ram Dass answered. "I would lose it far more
  cheerfully if you must lose yours also."</p>

  <p>The attorney stood up, blazing indignation. "Go then, to the Residency!"
  Ram Dass bowed to him in mock humility.</p>

  <p>"I kiss feet, heavenborn!"</p>

  <p>He bowed his way out, but he guessed Ananda Raz would have him followed.
  So, his purpose being to recover money, not to make more difficulties, he
  struggled against the rainstorm to the palace without the slightest effort at
  concealment. If Ananda Raz should guess that he was on his way to offer the
  Rajah loyalty and influence, possibly then Ananda Raz might change his mind
  and buy him off by purchasing the Rajah's debt. But if not&mdash;and if the
  Rajah should be obdurate or flat-broke&mdash;there was still the Residency
  and the more or less amusing prospect of annoying&mdash;and
  arousing&mdash;and compelling Major Smith to act with energy that was as
  foreign to his nature as humor and genuine dignity were.</p>

  <p>The officer on duty at the front gate never had been asked to pay his bill
  for horse-feed, so Ram Dass was promptly admitted. But he was questioned. The
  officer wanted to know what course the rioting had taken and what the
  prospect might be of a further demonstration at the palace gate.</p>

  <p>"I am not in politics," said Ram Dass, "and I mind my own business. But I
  have heard that the priests are up to something. They are crows who caw of
  death, remember!"</p>

  <p>The officer's face betrayed concern. "And His Highness is suddenly sick!"
  he remarked. "Just now they brought a doctor to him." If he had spoken the
  word "poison" he could not have expressed the thought more clearly.</p>

  <p>Ram Dass nodded, to conceal his own surprise. "His Highness's cousin's
  health?" he asked, to keep the thought in motion.</p>

  <p>But the officer was not so easy to tempt into indiscretion.</p>

  <p>"Go in," he answered. "Bring me the news on your way out."</p>

  <p>So as accident, or luck, or some unseen directing spirit such as dogs the
  ways of murderers, would have it, Ram Dass swayed and struggled against rain
  and wind and reached the Rajah's front steps, under the elaborately gaudy
  portico, exactly at the moment when Chullunder Ghose came down the steps to
  confer with Copeland, who was sitting on the back seat of the Ford attending
  to the nosebleed and the bruises of the villager. The villager was enjoying
  the fun of being "serviced" by a sahib, in a rich man's chariot, beneath the
  up-turned noses of a lot of Rajah's servants, who were showing their profound
  displeasure from the high steps of the very palace entrance. It was
  exquisitely pleasant to offend such haughty nabobs.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER 17</a><br>
  "Sappier and verbier than you guess! Hurry! Hurry!"</h2>

  <p class="first">NO less swift or sure of touch than Copeland's to the
  villager's needs, Chullunder Ghose's genius leaped instantly to deal with Ram
  Dass. That a middle-aged man of affairs should face such filthy weather, at a
  time of riot, was sufficient proof that opportunity was stirring, and the
  babu knew the nature of the seed that he had planted in the merchant's mind.
  The law of probabilities suggests, if it does not actually indicate, that
  certain sorts of men are likely to react in a clearly predictable way to
  certain sorts of pressure; and the babu was an artist; he could recognize a
  psychological condition with the accuracy of a sculptor making notes for
  future use, and with the skill of a physician who observes the symptoms that
  a patient is trying to hide from himself.</p>

  <p>"Which are you doing?" he demanded. "Are you sawing off the branch you sit
  on? Or are you trying to ride two camels, in two directions, with a fence
  between them that you wish to sit on?"</p>

  <p>"I have come to recover my money," said Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>With his belly thrust out and his hands on his hips, like a fat chef in an
  apron, the babu laughed at him. He laughed as if the universe held nothing
  else than good jokes.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you like to lose your money?" Ram Dass shot back irritably.</p>

  <p>"God, I haven't any! Ha! ha! You won't have any, unless you change your
  methods! I would rather look for goblets full of cool wine in the Gobi
  Desert, than for money where you go questing for it! You remind me of a
  virgin who has lost her reputation. It is irredeemably lost, and the thing
  for her to do is to forget it and establish herself as soon as possible as
  someone much too sensible to feed a dead horse!"</p>

  <p>"I have talked with Ananda Raz. I have just been to see him," said Ram
  Dass.</p>

  <p>"Anyone could guess that!" the babu answered. "And a pair of pale eggs in
  a frying-pan could see that you have told him too much and have heard too
  little! I suppose you offered to join the High Church party on condition that
  the party should agree to guarantee your money? Don't deny it. I would
  probably have done the same thing!"</p>

  <p>"What would you suggest?" Ram Dass asked. "You, who said you never bet,
  but who have lent your money to a profligate at the request of needy
  adventurer, in the hope of making too much profit from a contract to supply
  good elephants with bad corn&mdash;you astonish me that you forgot my hot
  tip! Bet on this babu, I told you."</p>

  <p>"Is it too late?"</p>

  <p>"Do I look it? Unless Hawkesey also has forgotten which horse he should
  bet on, and has upset all the dope by disobeying men he doesn't know and
  shooting away the weight that my opponents have to carry, I am winning hands
  down! Bet on me, you idiot!"</p>

  <p>"I bet," said Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. Go in and demand your money. He will say the money isn't
  due, and it isn't, but you must accuse him of having got it from you under
  false pretences, and of having shot the only witness."</p>

  <p>Ram Dass hesitated. "He will shoot me!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think so? In my presence? I shall be there, mind you. It is less
  than fifteen minutes since he did not dare to shoot me, all alone, and dearly
  though he would have loved to do it!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! If you are coming with me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I would not trust you to see him alone," the babu answered. "And now
  understand this&mdash;memorize it: he knows a lot too much already for his
  own good, because I have told it to him. I have given him exactly twenty
  minutes to prepare a trap, and I intend to walk right into it! He had the
  impudence to tell me that it takes his whole corps of mahouts that long to
  harness up an elephant. He had the ignorance to imagine I would wait in his
  office while he summoned somebody to quarrel with me and provoke a fortunate
  excuse for my arrest. He does not dare to kill me; he is contemplating other
  means of making me innocuous. So when he does what I am almost sure he
  contemplates, you are to fall into the trap too."</p>

  <p>Ram Dass was a much too easy-going usurer, and much too downright in his
  dealings to consider traps with equanimity. He checked again.</p>

  <p>"You have a sahib in the Ford car. Take him in there with you. I will wait
  here. Then, if you don't come out in due course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose affected sudden interest. He swept away resistance by
  accepting and conditioning the other man's proposal before he had time to
  voice it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. You could go to the Residency and report to Major Smith. But
  you must do that afterwards: It is of the utmost importance that you should
  go to the Residency, and I depend on you to do it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you planned this?" Ram Dass asked him. "How did you know I
  was on my way here?"</p>

  <p>"Planned it? No, no. But the second I saw you coming I knew the gods were
  working with me! 'Ram Dass,' I said to myself, 'is a gift of the gods to a
  man in a tight predicament!' I was in terror at the thought of taking in this
  surgeon sahib to protect me in the Rajah's presence. He is brave and
  honorable, but about as ignorant of statecraft as an alligator is of contract
  bridge. So you can estimate my pleasure when I saw you&mdash;thoroughly
  experienced and dependable Ram Dass! 'Here is a man,' said I, 'whom I can
  safely bet on! We shall help each other; what a privilege&mdash;what
  fun&mdash;what justice&mdash;in return to help him get his money!'"</p>

  <p>"Do you believe I can get it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you will trust me."</p>

  <p>"I have trusted you before," said Ram Dass, "but never to this extent.
  However, there is no fool like an old one. I will go in with you."</p>

  <p>"Not you. Go on now, ahead of me!" the babu answered; and he shoved him up
  the steps so violently that the palace servants noisily rebuked them both and
  Ram Dass felt he had to go in, to preserve his dignity, since otherwise the
  servants might honor themselves by thinking they had overawed him. Then
  Chullunder Ghose hurried to Copeland.</p>

  <p>"From now on, sahib, until hell and high water permit, you will kindly
  believe nothing unless I tell it to you! As, for instance, do you see an
  elephant? It is one! And you are to ride it&mdash;now, immediately! Get out.
  The mahout will set a ladder for you; climb it, and don't forget the rifle
  and the little black bag. The villager shall carry up your bedding, but don't
  let him appropriate it, you will need it badly. I will tell the villager
  where to go, and where to wait for me. If the mahout refuses to obey him,
  beat both of them with the butt end of your rifle and then beat the
  elephant&mdash;since that will cause the elephant to run, and the mahout to
  make the best of it; and it will make that villager believe you know what you
  are doing."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's as well I don't know?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Verb. sap.</i>, sahib! Sappier and verbier than you guess! Hurry!
  Hurry!"</p>

  <p>It would have been harder to persuade Copeland not to ride the elephant,
  in that holiday mood in which he found himself. It was a monster of a beast
  that swayed into the rain round the palace wall and halted beneath the
  portico. It seemed the Rajah had said nothing about trappings, so the chief
  mahout had compromised on a sort of semi-royal turn-out, with a howdah that
  had canvas weather-curtains and enough enameled woodwork to suggest that, at
  the very least, a royal favorite was being sent for a ride in the rain to
  cool her disposition. Copeland climbed the ladder, drew the curtains, and
  reached for his pipe.</p>

  <p>"O.K. with me," he chuckled.</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose watched the villager climb up with Copeland's luggage,
  then beckoned him down and took away the ladder.</p>

  <p>"Run away," he ordered.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You are a liar, a thief, a murderer, a greedy fool, a treacherous and
  dirty-minded ingrate, and a devil destined to be reborn in the belly of a
  worm. Besides, I don't trust you."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. But you like me," said the villager, "and that is why you take
  advantage of me. What now?"</p>

  <p>"To the devil with you," said the babu. "Run and fetch me a man I may
  trust."</p>

  <p>The villager turned his back and ran into the rain. He turned again and
  ran back.</p>

  <p>"This is he! And now what?"</p>

  <p>"This fellow looks like a talker to me," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Uh-uh! This one's name is Silent Shadow!"</p>

  <p>"Are you deaf and dumb?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then you can't hear me tell you to lead this elephant to the grain-barns
  that belong to Ram Dass, and to wait for me there. So you can't tell anyone I
  told you what to do. But you will do it."</p>

  <p>"The mahout might not obey me."</p>

  <p>"He is not deaf. I am not dumb. So he will obey me; otherwise the sahib in
  the howdah will instruct him with the butt end of a rifle."</p>

  <p>"Is he such an one, that sahib?"</p>

  <p>"He is such an one as cuts out livers. He extracts eyes. He cuts off
  noses. Legs and arms are so much trash to him, he mows them off. He can make
  a man unconscious in a moment, and the man may wake up with a noseless, blind
  head on a legless, armless body&mdash;and no liver either. That is the exact
  truth, so observe a careful attitude towards him."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I will make him like me as much as you do. Does your honor
  mean the barns of Ram Dass that are on the outskirts of the city, eastward
  from here? Very well. And now, since I am dumb, you had better command the
  mahout to tell his elephant to pick me up and set me in the howdah."</p>

  <p>"You will walk," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"In this rain?"</p>

  <p>"And being a silent shadow, you will observe whoever follows. If you speak
  to nobody until you see me&mdash;under any provocation, mind you &mdash; and
  if, when I give you leave to speak to me, your speech is satisfactory to me,
  I may consider you for permanent employment."</p>

  <p>"Don't doubt, I will satisfy you. Let me have a little money for my
  victuals."</p>

  <p>"You shall eat, at my expense, when I eat. Lead on."</p>

  <p>"<i>Atcha!</i> By the size of your honor's belly, I believe you eat good
  food and plenty of it."</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose aimed a kick at him to get him started. Then he ordered
  the mahout to follow and called up to Copeland to beat the mahout if he
  should dare to disobey the villager.</p>

  <p>"And if anyone asks you questions, say you are the Residency
  doctor&mdash;<i>locum tenens</i>&mdash;temporary&mdash;just come&mdash;out
  for a look at the scenery. They won't believe you, but they wouldn't believe
  you if you told the truth."</p>

  <p>Copeland laughed. "They'd have to search me! I don't know the truth!"</p>

  <p>"Nobody does," said the babu. "You shall see me when you see me. So
  long."</p>

  <p>The elephant swayed away majestically and the babu returned up the palace
  steps. He was nervous again.</p>

  <p>"You scowl at me?" said the attendant.</p>

  <p>"Open the door wider!" the babu commanded. "Do you take me for a sardine?
  Yes," he added, "things are going too well. I suspect you of soaping a stone
  for me to slip on!"</p>

  <p>Curiously cautious all at once, he peered round the door before he
  entered, but there was no one lurking there in ambush.</p>

  <p>"A hyena smells its own breath, and fears its own shadow," said the
  attendant, smiling acidly. He had received no slipper money&mdash;the
  extortion customary in the East, where slippers are supposed to be kicked off
  at the outer door and left in the attendant's charge. Chullunder Ghose's
  slippers lay beside the plainer ones of Ram Dass, on the top step. He
  returned. He picked them up. He handed them to the attendant.</p>

  <p>"You shall hold them for your greater honor," he remarked, "and if I catch
  you having set them down, you <i>beshirm</i>, I will ram them down your
  gullet! Where is Ram Dass?"</p>

  <p>Slightly cowed, but surly, the attendant pointed and another man came
  forward to escort the babu, who smiled, but his smile was noticeably thin, as
  if it had been pasted on his fat face. He was down into the depths of the
  fear that follows closely on audacity and sometimes overtakes it.</p>

  <p>"Things are going too well!" he repeated half aloud, and the escorting
  servant answered: "Sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I said, 'Hurry up, you father of a snail!'"</p>

  <p>He was as irritable now as he was normally serene. The palace gloom
  affected him. He started at the least sound. The corridor draught made him
  shudder.</p>

  <p>"Where is the library? Where was Syed-Suraj shot to death?" he suddenly
  demanded.</p>

  <p>They were passing the library door. The servant pointed to it. "There is
  still a broken window, so the room is disused for the present."</p>

  <p>"But I wish to see it," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Nay, it is forbidden."</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose, however, tried the doorknob. The door was not locked. He
  pushed it open, glanced inside, and suddenly stepped into the room, slamming
  the door in the servant's face. There was a key inside. He turned it.</p>

  <p><i>"Bohut salaam!"</i> he remarked in his usual calm voice, bowing from
  the hips, not lowering his eyes. His nervousness had gone as utterly as if it
  were a cloak that he had left behind him in the corridor. Here was real,
  unexpected, unimagined danger. He could face this. The Rajah, with his right
  hand in the mirror-paneled closet, turned to face him with a sneer as savage
  as a startled cat's.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER 18</a><br>
  "I know devils when I see them!"</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was brandy on the table. There was brandy in the
  Rajah's eyes too. They blazed. He had swallowed almost half a bottle of the
  stuff. A mere matter of twenty minutes, plus the alcohol, had changed a
  worried unregenerate into a calculating savage.</p>

  <p>"Who invited you in here?" he demanded, and the babu guessed he had to
  answer well and swiftly or receive a bullet in the belly.</p>

  <p>"You did! Your dilemma did! Unless you act exactly as I tell you, it is
  absolutely certain that the blood of Syed-Suraj will be avenged on your head!
  I am here to save you from it."</p>

  <p>That was stark bluff, and the Rajah suspected it was. But he was as eager
  to conceal what he was doing with his right hand as the babu was to see what
  he was doing. If there was a pistol in the closet, it was strange that the
  Rajah did not pull it out and use it. The babu's wits worked furiously, and
  he was gaining control of his face. He smiled inscrutably&mdash;a poker smile
  that might mean triumph; or it might not.</p>

  <p>"Has not Ram Dass asked you for his money?" he said slowly. "You are
  rightly afraid of Ram Dass. So am I afraid of him. He is the one man rich and
  important enough, and determined enough, to force an intervention by the
  British. He would do it for revenge if he believed you cheated him. But can
  you pay him back his money?"</p>

  <p>"It is not due," said the Rajah, trying to withdraw his hand without
  disturbing something, or without opening the closet door so wide that the
  babu could see what was in there. Probably he hoped, too, that Chullunder
  Ghose might think there was a firearm on the shelf.</p>

  <p>"But Ram Dass says you did cheat," said the babu. "He asserts you borrowed
  under false pretences, not intending to repay. Why did you borrow the
  money&mdash;such a little sum of money? And where is it?"</p>

  <p>That was calculated impudence. The brandied dignity of royal breeding
  boiled up, and the Rajah withdrew his hand to strike, or to make a gesture
  with it. Keys clashed, and something fell forward off a closet shelf and
  stuck between shelf and door as the Rajah tried to slam the door shut with
  his foot. The babu moved a trifle sideways, and the Rajah followed his
  movement, as a cornered snake does, so that the pressure of his foot against
  the closet door was relaxed and something fell to the floor with a crash.</p>

  <p>It was an unlocked, decorated metal box. It spilled its contents. There
  were seed-pearls and a lot of semi-precious stones&mdash;trash for the most
  part; but there also was an aigrette set with diamonds that was probably one
  of the jewels of State. The Rajah tried to hide it with his foot, but he was
  too late.</p>

  <p>"You propose to offer that to Ram Dass as security?" the babu asked, sure
  of himself now. "You had much better traffic with me. I am a poor man."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The Rajah's eyes glowed sullenly, but there was a
  flicker of indecision and a hint of half-awakened hope about the way he
  showed his teeth through slightly parted lips.</p>

  <p>"You haven't tried to tempt me, have you?" said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Blackmail?"</p>

  <p>"Never! A reward for saving you from abdication and the Andamans, however,
  might be&mdash;well, it might make matters easier."</p>

  <p>"I have no money at the moment."</p>

  <p>"None? Not any? None of what you had from Ram Dass?"</p>

  <p>"I have only three thousand rupees of it left. And as for you, you dog, I
  wouldn't trust you with it. You would pocket it and then betray me."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course I would, if I could do it!" said the babu. "I don't love
  you and you don't love me. But how do you suppose I am to pacify Ram Dass,
  unless I let him see what happens to his money, or some part of it, and tell
  him why it happens? And if Ram Dass is a witness, how shall I be able to
  betray you without ruining myself? So I suggest that you should let me talk
  to Ram Dass, and then pay that money to me in his presence. It is very little
  money. It is scandalously little. But if it's all I can get I will have to
  accept it."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and then collaborate with Ram Dass to betray me!" said the
  Rajah.</p>

  <p>"I would tell you not to be a fool, if you were not a royal personage,"
  the babu answered. "I am under orders, as I told you, to prevent an
  abdication if it can be done. And Ram Dass simply wants his money. Promise
  him the elephant-feed contract and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I did. I offered that just now," the Rajah interrupted. "He refused to
  listen."</p>

  <p>"Let me talk to him."</p>

  <p>The Rajah hesitated, blustering to hide his fear that fifty of his crimes
  were known to the babu. It would be no use buying him off on two or three
  counts, only to be blackmailed on a dozen others.</p>

  <p>"You dog of a devil!" he sneered. "It might be wiser in the end to shoot
  you as you deserve! And besides, this is inconvenient. I need that
  money."</p>

  <p>"So do I," the babu answered smiling. "However, keep it&mdash;keep it!
  Anyone who won't pay that small sum of money to be saved from abdication and
  the Andamans is, after all, no patron for a man of influence like me! It may
  be better to report to my employers that this is a situation too explosive to
  be saved except by drastic measures."</p>

  <p>"I will try you," said the Rajah. "But if I even suspect you of playing a
  trick, you fat hog &mdash;" He snapped his fingers by way of
  illustration.</p>

  <p>"Bring the money," said the babu. "Let us waste no more time."</p>

  <p>But the Rajah had to go and get the money, so he turned the babu over to a
  servant.</p>

  <p>"Keep an eye on the fat brute!" he ordered. "See that he waits in the
  corridor. During my absence he is not to speak to Ram Dass."</p>

  <p>So the babu stood and stared out of a window, and because it was raining
  outside and the murky clouds shut off the sun, someone had turned on the
  hideous electric chandelier that dangled like a trained icicle from the
  corridor ceiling. The window-glass, due to the stronger light on the inside,
  became a moderately clear reflector of the corridor. The babu watched it.
  Suddenly he ducked. His foot slipped on the polished marble and he fell on
  his back. He rolled sideways as far as the wall and got up cautiously, first
  on his hands and knees, with his back to the window. However, he could only
  see a very slight sway of the curtains at the far end of the corridor where,
  in the window-glass, he had detected the long tube of a blowpipe. And in the
  window-pane behind him was a neat hole surrounded by feathery cracks, such as
  nothing on earth could have made but a sharp dart.</p>

  <p>"Am I so unpopular?" he asked the servant. "Stand here and observe me! How
  can you observe what I am doing if you shrink behind that statue?"</p>

  <p>He compelled the man to stand between him and the curtains; and the
  fellow's nervous shudder and his furtive glances were enough proof that he
  knew about the blowpipe and expected at least another shot. The babu watched
  him like a lynx.</p>

  <p>"If you should move your right hand, I would break your neck!" he warned
  him. "Not that you are not a pleasant fellow, nicely scented up with musk to
  save your nose from turning upward, but I dislike a knife in my belly."</p>

  <p>Then the Rajah returned, not more than glancing at the babu as he beckoned
  him and opened a door on the right-hand side of the corridor. He looked as if
  he had another stock of brandy somewhere and had swallowed a lot of
  it&mdash;perhaps to make it easier to part with money.</p>

  <p>"Wait for me. We will go in here together!" said the babu. "Your assassins
  are such rotten shots that they might hit the wrong man unless I protect you!
  How you would laugh if you knew how important to me your royal life is!"</p>

  <p>"You are drunk, you fat fool!" said the Rajah.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Your Highness. I am so drunk that I do not notice that you, not the
  servant, have opened the door. Has he a pistol? A dagger? What has he?"</p>

  <p>Sullenly the Rajah jerked his head. The servant slunk away along the
  corridor. The Rajah entered the room and the babu followed him. Ram Dass was
  standing in a big bay window, dwarfed and as shabbily aged as a mendicant by
  the high ceiling and the rich cut-velvet hangings. He looked sorry for
  himself and eager to be back amid the grain-sacks in his comfortable store;
  but he perked up at sight of the babu. As he bowed to the Rajah he raised
  both hands respectfully to his wrinkled forehead and glanced between his
  fingers at Chullunder Ghose. But there was no answering signal, and for a
  moment here was silence. The Rajah seemed not to know what to say. However,
  it was up to him to speak first, so he turned contemptuously on Chullunder
  Ghose.</p>

  <p>"It is beneath my dignity to repeat your conversation," he sneered. "Tell
  this merchant what you have suggested."</p>

  <p>Then, as naively as if he were a bagman selling rubbish to a fool,
  Chullunder Ghose unfolded his proposal to the gravely nodding Ram Dass, who
  stroked a graying beard and puckered wise eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ram Dass, sahib, as your honor knows, this babu is the underpaid employee
  of a government that sends me into trouble but repudiates me if I can't keep
  out of it. I know His Highness owes you money, but he can't pay me to turn my
  coat and do him certain little favors, if he pays you also. And, besides, he
  has not enough money for you at the moment. He has only three thousand
  rupees. And that is my price."</p>

  <p>"I demand my money," Ram Dass answered.</p>

  <p>"Either that, or I go to the Residency. And if Major Smith won't ask for
  an investigation, I myself will go to Delhi and demand a hearing at the
  Foreign Office."</p>

  <p>He was so sour and vehement that he almost deceived Chullunder Ghose. He
  made the Rajah swear and stutter.</p>

  <p>"Tell him!" he commanded. "Tell him what you told me!"</p>

  <p>"In a moment. Ram Dass, sahib, only this babu in all the world can save
  His Highness from flattering the Kaiser and the King of Spain by imitating
  them. But he would have no money and less liberty, so he would rather imitate
  the Czar of Russia. And that would do nobody any good, since who would pay
  his debts? So he proposes to pay me a little money in your presence, and to
  assign to you all the contracts that are at his disposal. In return we are to
  lend him our united influence, and you are not to press him for the money he
  recently borrowed, until it is due. I beg your honor to agree."</p>

  <p>"I want my money now," said Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>"But he can't pay!"</p>

  <p>"I won't pay until it is due," said the Rajah.</p>

  <p>"And unless he pays me something there will be a calamity," said the babu.
  "All his creditors will have to whistle for a dividend from nothing, properly
  prorated after the attorneys have been satisfied. He is to bribe me in your
  presence to prevent my double-crossing him. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>Ram Dass looked amazed. "I didn't know you take bribes," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I can seldom get them," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," said Ram Dass, "that your influence can actually save this
  Rajah? Changes are sometimes bad for business. When we know where we are, we
  are there, at any rate. But can you do it?"</p>

  <p>"I am sent to save him from an abdication," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"But you won't, unless he bribes you? Oh, well. I shall never think the
  same of you again. But stability counts. I will wait for my money &mdash;
  provided I get all the contracts for delivery of corn."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the Rajah, "at a good price&mdash;at a very good price. I
  will see the treasurer about it, and you need not fee him. But I shall expect
  your loyal influence. There must be counter-propaganda to offset the lies the
  priests are telling."</p>

  <p>"I detest those rogues," said Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>The Rajah forced a smile. He crackled three one-thousand rupee notes and
  laid them on the window-sill.</p>

  <p>"I may depend on both of you&mdash;eh? They are yours. You may take them,"
  he said to the babu. But as he drew his hand away his finger-ring struck the
  window-pane. And as the babu took the money, a red turban &mdash; two
  eyes&mdash;then a lean, mean face appeared above the sill.</p>

  <p>"You see, we have another witness!" said the Rajah, smiling much more
  genuinely than he had done. "I supposed a little bribe was all you wanted, so
  I took a precaution."</p>

  <p>"Only one?" the babu asked him.</p>

  <p>"No need now to kill you!" said the Rajah. "You will either serve my
  interests without fail, or lose your job and go to prison for accepting
  bribes. You understand me?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, huzoor."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>huzoor</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a title of respect; sir.
  See <i><a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:184.hobson">The
  Hobson Jobson Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"You had better begin to use your wits at once against those thieving
  priests."</p>

  <p>"I wish to do so."</p>

  <p>"And don't forget that they are intriguing to get my loving cousin on the
  throne."</p>

  <p>"I will not forget it."</p>

  <p>"Then you have my leave to take your beastly presence hence into the rain,
  you blackguard, and begin!"</p>

  <p>"I go now," said the babu.</p>

  <p>Bowing&mdash;suitably respectful&mdash;he and Ram Dass hurried out.
  Chullunder Ghose retrieved his slippers from the door attendant and slapped
  him with one of them.</p>

  <p>"Just to remember me by!" he remarked. "Your master has insulted me. Out
  of my way, you dog, before I spit at you!"</p>

  <p>"Just try to get in here again!" said the attendant.</p>

  <p>"You have done it now!" Ram Dass grumbled. He hurried down the front
  steps, but the babu overtook him.</p>

  <p>"Get in!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>"Into that old Ford? Not I. It has flat tires. Why should I risk my neck
  at my age?"</p>

  <p>"Because I tell you. Get in!"</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose hustled him in, but it took him a minute or two to get
  the thing started, and he had to hold the merchant.</p>

  <p>"Let me out, I tell you! I have never ridden in a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Fear seized Ram Dass as the car jerked forward, missing badly, thumping on
  its rims. He set his teeth and held on grimly until the car had to stop at
  the iron gate, where the officer, dismounted now, leaned in to speak to the
  babu.</p>

  <p>"What news?"</p>

  <p>"Not much," said the babu. "Any more rioting?"</p>

  <p>"None yet. That one volley turned their stomachs. Let us hope the rain
  will continue. That will stop rioting. But tell me your news."</p>

  <p>"Can you keep a secret?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"None better! I am trained to keep them."</p>

  <p>"Don't say that I told you. But the truth is that Hawkesey&mdash;you know
  Hawkesey?"</p>

  <p>"Don't I!"</p>

  <p>"Hawkesey has been got at! He has turned against His Highness. He is in a
  temple in the jungle, where he is conspiring with the priests to bring about
  a <i>coup d'état</i> to put the Rajah's cousin on the throne. Hawkesey has
  been promised double salary. And the Rajah's cousin has guaranteed him a
  pension for life in the event that the British insist on having him deported.
  That's all."</p>

  <p>"And you call that nothing? Does His Highness know it?"</p>

  <p>"No. And I daren't tell him," said the babu. "Even if I did dare, I could
  not get back into the palace. One of the attendants has assaulted me. He
  called me vile names. All the palace servants are afraid of me because they
  think I spy on them and will report them to the Rajah. So I don't know what
  to do."</p>

  <p>"How many people know this?" the officer asked.</p>

  <p>"Not many, sahib. Even Ram Dass hears it only for the first time."</p>

  <p>The officer affected scorn. "I don't believe this. It is another big-fish
  story."</p>

  <p>"Who expects you to believe it? Who expects the Rajah to believe it?
  Nobody believes a true tale, until too late! Why should you believe me? I am
  an anonymous and stupid fat man, sent by someone stupider than me to find out
  what is going on&mdash;so, naturally, I know nothing! I would like to know,
  though, what the Rajah is to do about it!"</p>

  <p>"Five hundred men!" said the officer. "We can hew hard. We can shoot
  straight. Even Hawkes has praised our shooting lately!"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. I suppose, then, you will face about and display your heroism to
  a brigade or so of British troops? You idiot! Do you suppose the British will
  permit a civil war in this State at a time when they must also deal with
  Gandhi and a dozen other troubles? They will simply march in and annex the
  territory. And then where will you be? Perhaps you think the British will
  sack their commander-in-chief in order to provide you with a fat job?"</p>

  <p>"What is this about poison?" the officer asked. "His Highness sent away
  that doctor just now on an elephant."</p>

  <p>"Poison, nothing! I suspect the Rajah knows the truth of what is happening
  and simply has the wind up! He is drinking too much, and he has a headache,
  that's all. Anyone who told him what to do would be a Godsend to him."</p>

  <p>"I can reach him," said the officer. "His Highness is always willing to
  receive me whenever I have anything to report."</p>

  <p>"But you are not to tell him that I told you," said the babu. "He would be
  angry with me for not having told him myself just now, when I had the
  chance."</p>

  <p>"Why did you not tell?" asked the officer.</p>

  <p>"Because I was afraid of him, for one thing. As for you, if you are not
  afraid, you had better say your own spies told you. Thus you will receive
  more credit."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Yes, that part of it is simple. But what is the proper advice to
  give him?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me!" laughed the babu. "Who am I to know that? I know well enough
  what I would do in his shoes. But I am not in them, praise be to the gods of
  Karma!"</p>

  <p>"What would you do?"</p>

  <p>"I would go to that temple on elephant-back. I would take not more than
  one or two men with me, and perhaps some servants. I would order Hawkesey to
  return to duty."</p>

  <p>"And if Hawkes should refuse?" asked the officer.</p>

  <p>The babu stared. "Are you so innocent as that? Do you suppose Hawkesey
  would shoot him&mdash;and hang? Of course he would not! Could he take him
  prisoner? Quite equally, of course not! What could Hawkesey do with such a
  prisoner? I tell you, Hawkesey is alone, with only three or four priests. He
  is supposed to be shooting a tiger. He is actually making propaganda."</p>

  <p>"Why not appeal to the British?"</p>

  <p>"That would take time," said the babu. "Time is in favor of Hawkesey."</p>

  <p>"Why not go, then, with a hundred men and seize Hawkes?"</p>

  <p>"Because of the rioting! Let twenty-five, or fifty, or a hundred armed men
  march, in monsoon weather, and who will believe the Rajah is not making war
  against the priests? Do you suppose the priests will sit still and say
  nothing? You have never seen a riot such as that one would be!"</p>

  <p>"But if Hawkes refuses to surrender to His Highness personally?"</p>

  <p>"Then the Rajah has a fine case, hasn't he, against the British! They
  would have to help him to destroy Hawkes, but it would not give them an
  excuse to overturn the government and put another in the Rajah's place. At
  the least, they would have to pretend to be ashamed of Hawkesey's
  misbehavior."</p>

  <p>"Well, why not shoot Hawkes?" asked the officer. "He might be ambushed. Or
  he might be tempted into a parley and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how I envy anyone whom you advise!" the babu interrupted. "Shoot
  Hawkes without bringing him to trial&mdash;and then see who can stop the yell
  of 'murder' that will go up! Don't forget that Hawkes is much more popular
  than you are. And the priests, who probably despise him, nevertheless would
  take advantage of his murder to accuse the Rajah. Can the British let a
  Britisher be killed and not retaliate?"</p>

  <p>"So you suggest&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"That he should use his courage!" said the babu. "Has he any? Order them
  to open me the gate, I pray you."</p>

  <p>Presently, in drenching rain, in mutually watchful silence, Chullunder
  Ghose and Ram Dass skidded to a standstill. There was no one near the
  yellow-shuttered corn-shop except a dish-faced penitent who sat in sackcloth,
  chin on knees, beside the shop door; even he seemed unobservant.</p>

  <p>"Now I thank God I am still alive," said Ram Dass, starting up the steps
  between the ancient cannons. He seemed to wish the babu not to follow him. He
  hurried. He turned at the shop door and noticed the babu giving money to the
  dish-faced individual.</p>

  <p>"Buy merit if you can! You need some," he remarked, and then entered his
  shop.</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose followed him through to the back room, where the
  oil-stove burned amid the corn-sacks. Ram Dass turned on him.</p>

  <p>"You are insane!" he said bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I hope so, sahib! Here are your three thousand rupees. Take them."</p>

  <p>"My three thousand? Are you drunk too?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. When insanity has done its job, I mean to get as drunk as
  Bacchus! Take your money. You are fined two thousand dibs for having lent
  good money to a bad crook! I could not do any better for you."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean it? You are not so mad after all. That dirty dog would never
  have repaid me, whatever I threatened. He knew I was bluffing. I thank you.
  Three thousand is better than nothing at all. And I apologize for my remarks
  just now."</p>

  <p>"But how about the contracts?" asked the babu. "Do you want them? And
  don't you owe me something? Turn about is fair play."</p>

  <p>"Money? How much?"</p>

  <p>"To the devil with your money! Hawkesey and I are on the level. So are
  you, Ram Dass-jee. Run an errand for me, and we cry quits!"</p>

  <p>"What now?"</p>

  <p>"Go to the Residency and insist on seeing Major Smith, however many times
  he may refuse to see you. Tell him that his boils are not an alibi, and say
  you have important information for him. Then, as soon as he has finished
  reprimanding you for the intrusion, turn the tables on him. Say that the
  priests are telling all the people that the Rajah has sent Hawkesey to commit
  a sacrilege by invading a sacred place. Say also that the Rajah boasts that
  Major Smith advised him to send Hawkesey, and that therefore the people are
  doubly indignant. Tell him that today's riot was a prelude to rebellion that
  only he can prevent. And then commence to flatter him. When flattery has done
  its work, tell him you have overheard me talking to the Rajah's bodyguard,
  and say you think the Rajah intends to force a civil war, in order to compel
  the British India authorities to intervene and put the hooks into the
  priests&mdash;which will inevitably bring the British into the religious sort
  of difficulty that they dread with all their nerve and instinct."</p>

  <p>"I was right when I called you insane," said Ram Dass.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, reserve your judgment," said the babu. "My insanity is
  catching! What I want is to get Major Smith to hurry to the palace. He will
  take a sore neck and a rotten temper with him. He will threaten the Rajah. He
  will Dutch-uncle him. I know Smith. And if I know the Rajah, he will drink a
  lot of brandy and decide on what a statesman would have jumped at in the
  first place&mdash;and spoil it by incorporating what that officer of the
  guard to whom I spilled a little seed of my insanity, advises."</p>

  <p>"Then what?"</p>

  <p>"Major Eustace Smith will get a decoration."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I shall get a reprimand, and much more interesting work to do.
  And you will get the contracts."</p>

  <p>"Pah! I doubt it. That man's promise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is as good as wooden money, no doubt. How about his cousin's promise? If
  I tell his cousin you were instrumental in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh! This man has to abdicate?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"What then?"</p>

  <p>"Wait and see!" the babu answered. "Will you do that errand at the
  Residency?"</p>

  <p>Ram Dass rubbed a finger on his sly old nose and hesitated half a minute.
  Then he answered:</p>

  <p>"I will do it. Not because I trust you, but because I think you trust
  me."</p>

  <p>"Stchah-Stchah! The fellow to trust is the Rajah," the babu answered. "I
  know devils when I see them!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER 19</a><br>
  "C.3 meant to do that, if he did it"</h2>

  <p class="first">FAMILIAR though he was with death's most bloody and
  disgusting shapes, Hawkes was dazed and sickened by the devotee's death at
  the claws and fangs of the tiger of Kali's temple. Helplessly bound, with the
  stench of the tiger's den beneath him and the grim hag's torchlight breaking
  up the gloom, he hugged the wall again for fear of falling off the ledge.
  Ghosts of dead men seemed to leap out from the shadows. He could hear the
  tiger snarling and the crunch of the brute's fangs on human flesh and
  bone.</p>

  <p>There was no more ceremony, except that the hag stood upright on her
  broken pillar and began to scream, waving and shaking her torch. She was as
  mad-drunk as ever a Roman mob became at orgies of dramatically frightful
  death. Her screams appeared to stir the tigress in the cage behind the stone
  bars; eyes that glittered in the torchlight did a dance to the measureless
  rhythm of the hag's chant, leaving to imagination the invisible contortions
  of a body yearning to glut strength in a feast of frenzy.</p>

  <p>Both Hawkes's captors seized him by the shoulders, raised him to his feet
  and started back along the gallery, one leading with the shrouded lantern and
  the other urging from behind. He could not have been recognized by any of the
  others on that gallery; it had been too dark; his captors hustled him away
  too soon. At the end of a winding passage&mdash;not the same they came
  by&mdash;they descended three steps and passed through an iron door that F.11
  closed and bolted. Then the other unshrouded the lantern&mdash;grinned and
  pointed.</p>

  <p>Half in and half out of a trough of carved stone lay a python, heavier and
  much longer than any Indian python Hawkes had ever seen. It was offended by
  the lantern-light. Red anger stared from its fixed eyes. It swayed its head
  in baffled arcs as it tried to see beyond the lantern. Then it crawled away
  across the threshold of another door and vanished amid tumbled masonry. And
  F.15 spoke:</p>

  <p>"Fed full! He has slain his count of men, that serpent; but he eats goats,
  since a man is too much for his jaws to swallow, though he crushes them like
  sponges dipped in red wine! One goat a week they give him&mdash;and six for
  the tigress; on the seventh day they let her hunger. But to the he-tiger they
  give nothing; he must hunt men!"</p>

  <p>"Loose my arms!" Hawkes ordered. "Dammit, I gave all my whisky to the
  elephant. I need a drink like Judas Iscariot!"</p>

  <p>F.11 unfastened his arms and chafed the places where the raw hide thong
  had bitten when he strained against it in his terror.</p>

  <p>"Now the rifle!"</p>

  <p>F.11 gave it to him. There was no hint of his being a prisoner now &mdash;
  no fear of him, and not the slightest trace of anything but comradeship. F.15
  and F.11 grinned, disclosing teeth as yellow as their long smocks, and their
  eyes were as inscrutable as those of alligators. They were partners in an
  ugly game; they were as full of guile as rats, as full of ruthlessness as
  leopards; but they were as friendly as two good hunting dogs.</p>

  <p>Hawkes stared up at a ceiling formed by broken vaulting, into which huge
  blocks of masonry had jammed themselves in falling.</p>

  <p>"What now?" he demanded. "I'd like half a ton o' T.N.T. I'd fix this place
  up proper! Samson could ha' done the job right&mdash;pull away the props and
  drop it on 'em? Never heard o' Samson? You should go to Sunday school, the
  same as I did. How do I get out o' this?"</p>

  <p>"You don't!" said F.11. "Did not C.3 tell you to obey us?"</p>

  <p>"Chullunder Ghose asked me to get back quick to him with information,"
  Hawkes answered. "If you've any message for him, get it off your chests, now.
  And then how about one of you coming to show me the way home?"</p>

  <p>Both men shook their heads. "Our orders are to stay here," F.11 answered.
  "We have done our work well. Soonya believes we are a pair of Kali-worshipers
  in quest of this death." Even F.11 shuddered. "Our turn is the last &mdash;
  us two together&mdash;after all the others have been torn and fanged into
  eternity. We are to keep you here until the babu comes. He said so."</p>

  <p>Hawkes asked: "Did he mention me by name?"</p>

  <p>"He did not. What does C.3 care about a man's name? C.3 is a doer of the
  silent deeds that set up this one, and that set down that one, but that leave
  him as secret as the drawers of night's curtain. Nay, a man's name or his
  place are nothing to him; for if Number One says, 'this one is a traitor;
  ruin him!' or 'that one is a true man in a tight place; clear a way for him a
  little!' C.3 does it. And he told us he would send a man to stand by, who
  should do our bidding and defend us if it comes to grave need. We are to
  defend him also and to show him all we can discover. You are that one."</p>

  <p>"Am I? I'm in a predicament," Hawkes answered. "That's what I'm in. First
  of all, the Rajah's Dirty Dick says I'm to come and shoot the tiger. I tell
  C.3, and he urges me to come, but says I'm&mdash;not to shoot the tiger; I'm
  to hurry back and tell him what's what. On the other hand, he did say I'm to
  dress by anyone I find here who appears to have credentials; and you blokes
  have 'em. And you tell me I'm to stay along o' you until he comes. But I'm
  paid by the State o' Kutchdullub, out o' taxes, and supposed to obey the
  Rajah&mdash;barring that, I mayn't take part in politics or buck the local
  prejudices, one of which is that a white man shouldn't enter temples. It's a
  mix-up! Damned if I know what to do now! I've a mind to go and shoot both
  tigers to begin with."</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, sahib! C.3 needs them."</p>

  <p>"What the hell for? Is he crazy? Ever since I've known him he was just a
  good old fatty with a sense o' fun and twice his share of honest guts. Has he
  gone off his onion? Does he know about the goings on in this place? Has it
  made him barmy? Dammit, I'll go barmy if I don't get out o' here!"</p>

  <p>"But in the darkness, sahib? Through a jungle such as this one? In the
  monsoon?"</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest?" Hawkes answered.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, we are pieces in the game he plays, so let him move us!"</p>

  <p>"But he has told you one thing, and me another!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, nothing is more certain than that C.3 meant to do that, if he did
  it."</p>

  <p>"Damn his eyes!" Hawkes spat perplexity. Then he reached for his pipe and
  swore again when he remembered he was naked to the waist and that his pipe
  was in his jacket pocket, in a cell at the end of a maze of winding passages.
  "You two come and sit by my fire," he suggested. "It'll go out if I don't get
  back and heap some wood on. We can sit there until daylight&mdash;fresh air
  and no skeeters&mdash;how about it?"</p>

  <p>Both men nodded.</p>

  <p>"But to hell with that damned hole where you two caught me by the feet!"
  said Hawkes. "We'll stick a rock in that from top-side. Let's get out o' here
  and find our way by the glow o' my fire in the dark."</p>

  <p>"But there is no way out." said F.11, "except through the chamber where
  the woman keeps watch."</p>

  <p>"O.K. She shall have my butt end if she cuts up!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay! She is mad, that woman, and she has the cleverness of madness.
  As a drunkard gets drink, or as a drug-addict gets drugs, Soonya will get
  what she is after, until the end comes. It is better that we let her think
  she has her way now. She will take a short cut to her way if we stir
  suspicion. If we slew her, we should have those others down on us; and they
  would be worse than she is, because they would have lost their guide into
  eternal death! They would say we had robbed her also of eternal death! She
  teaches that eternal death is only to be had by dying in the right mood and
  exactly at the proper moment, of one's own will. And they crave the
  nothingness of nothing&mdash;the annihilation of themselves and of knowing,
  and feeling, and being. They crave it as an egg craves life, or as a lover
  yearns for his beloved."</p>

  <p>"All right. Up the hole!" Hawkes answered. "I'll go nutty if I stay here,
  that's a safe bet."</p>

  <p>He shuddered. Unimaginative as a rule, and ignorant as most men are of all
  that did not interest him, he had not the remotest notion of the meaning of
  that temple, or of the fact that Moloch-worship, the fire of the Inquisition,
  and a hundred other horrors, are only new names for a basic madness that is
  older than history. All Hawkes cared to know just then was that the stars and
  moon were shining somewhere outside, up above a murky wilderness of clouds
  that would be blown away by clean air. And he yearned for that air in his
  lungs&mdash;good, washed air.</p>

  <p>"Get a move on!"</p>

  <p>F.15 led, carrying the lantern. F.11 followed with a cat-like tread that
  suggested his own nerves were nothing to boast of just then. The contact with
  Hawkes's plain thinking probably had showed him, as a light shows darkness,
  something of his own weird peril. He seemed almost as much afraid as Hawkes
  was, and the echoes of the thump of Hawkes's boots on the floor of shadowy,
  long passages so scared him that he crowded close on Hawkes's heels and
  glanced backward so often that Hawkes, too, felt they were pursued. Crowding
  on the man ahead, Hawkes stumbled frequently, because there were steps in
  unexpected places and the rising ramps between them were encumbered by the
  litter of fallen carvings off the passage walls. But at last they reached the
  sloping hole that Hawkes had come down at the invitation of the woman.</p>

  <p>Then F.11 went up first with his rawhide looped round his waist, and when
  he reached the top he lowered it for Hawkes to clamber up by. But it was too
  short. F.15, with bare feet, had a better grip on time-smoothed masonry, so
  Hawkes, encumbered by his rifle, had to tread on the lamp-bearer's shoulders,
  and the two of them slid twice to ground again before Hawkes caught the noose
  at last. It tightened on his hand, and F.11 felt the strain. He pulled hard.
  Hawkes went upward like a fish hooked foul, and landed, cursing, with his
  chest and face in bat-dirt and the stench of that to stomach rather than the
  fresh night wind for which he famished.</p>

  <p>But the fire burned; all it needed was a few sticks and a moment's
  fanning. Outside, gusty rain was splashing on the stones and gurgling down
  the channels it had cut in slopes of root-bound debris. Hawkes went out,
  trousers, boots and all, and washed himself until the bat-stench faded. Then
  he pulled off his trousers and wrung them, coming in again to dry them at the
  welcome fire and squat there like a wet frog. He examined his rifle carefully
  by firelight before he found his pipe. When he had filled and lighted that he
  felt less nervous, but a military instinct urged him.</p>

  <p>"Take that rock, you two, and plug the hole," he ordered. "There's a brace
  o' tigers, and a woman, and a python; none o' them's good company."</p>

  <p>When they had done that they came and squatted on their heels beside him,
  and for a long time there was silence, only broken by the storm sounds or
  when one of them poked the fire. But at last Hawkes got into his clothes, and
  that broke F.11's reverie.</p>

  <p>"Until the earthquake," he said, "and that was in the time of Akbar, or
  earlier, this temple was known as a place where death could be had for the
  asking. There was fire in those days. Men&mdash;aye, and women were thrown
  in, at their own wish, after being taught the meaning of it by the priests of
  Kali. But it always was a secret, told in whispers. Men said that the
  earthquake ended it. But our trade teaches this, if nothing else; that evil
  has no end and no beginning. Vigilance reduces it, as day does night, but
  even day has shadows. None knows how to stay night from returning. And an
  evil springs up from its own roots in the very shadow of the scythe that just
  now mowed its stalks."</p>

  <p>"Hell, you talk like a funeral," Hawkes objected. "What do you draw pay
  for? Half the world 'ud starve if the other half weren't in need of policing,
  one way or another. Clean up! Rout this place out! Burn it like a hornets'
  nest!"</p>

  <p>"And there would still be hornets, sahib! Aye, aye, we are sent to clean
  this. Trust us, we will do it. C.3 will attend to it. But there is no end.
  That which causes evil will discover such another place and find another way
  of befouling the darkness. It is like the cholera&mdash;plague &mdash;
  smallpox&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's a job o' work for you blokes&mdash;What's that?" Hawkes asked.
  Suddenly he gripped his rifle. Wind was blowing, but the rain had spent
  itself and myriads of night sounds were as audible as Hawkes's own
  breathing!</p>

  <p>"It was probably a jackal or a rat," said F.11.</p>

  <p>"Shut up! Let me listen."</p>

  <p>Water trickled and the frogs made a floor of din on which all other noises
  marched. It was impossible to see beyond the firelight, even if smoke had not
  watered their eyes. And the wind went sighing through the foliage of creepers
  rooted on the ruins. One could imagine anything. Hawkes whispered:</p>

  <p>"Were you expecting someone?"</p>

  <p>"Only C.3."</p>

  <p>"'Tisn't him; he'd give his signal. But there's someone out there who has
  seen our fire. He's afraid to come close before he knows who's in here."</p>

  <p>"Surely a hyena, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Sit still." Hawkes took his rifle and crawled out, cursing the
  mosquitoes. For a while he sat in total darkness, listening, but at last he
  put himself directly in the zone of firelight and stood upright so that he
  could not help but be seen if there were eyes in that outer darkness. He
  could hear no outcry, and no footstep. He had decided he was mistaken and had
  faced about to crawl back through the hole when something touched him on the
  instep and he almost yelled, it felt so like a snake. It gripped his ankle.
  He raised his rifle to smash at whatever it was with the butt, when a voice
  said "Sahib!" and he checked the blow in mid-swing.</p>

  <p>Hawkes sat. He knew his knees had given way from panic. He pretended to
  himself that he had sat in order not to have to raise his voice. Training and
  natural doggedness served him; he recovered swiftly, and the moment he could
  trust his voice he answered, hardly above a whisper:</p>

  <p>"Well? What?"</p>

  <p>"I am F.9."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I look for F.11."</p>

  <p>"Where are you from, and who sent you?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I will not answer that until I know who you are."</p>

  <p>"Come in then."</p>

  <p>"I will follow, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Watch your step then! Any funny business and you'll wish you hadn't!"</p>

  <p>Hawkes did not catch even a glimpse of the owner of the voice until he
  himself had crawled back to the fireside. Even then he only saw a momentary
  naked shadow, because a bundle of wet clothing struck him in the face, and by
  the time he recovered from that surprise the newcomer's wet fingers had
  gripped him by the throat from behind. It was an iron grip, one-handed,
  forcing his face in jerks towards the fire while another hand twisted his arm
  behind him. Then his pipe fell from his teeth into the embers. F.11's hand
  recovered it. There was a little talk in undertones, and then the grip
  relaxed as it had seized hold, suddenly. Hawkes struck at random, but his
  fist hit nothing and a man laughed.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to fight me, sahib? Better give a number next time, if you
  hope to be questioned gently! I was taught to take no chances."</p>

  <p>"Who the devil are you?"</p>

  <p>"Not the devil&mdash;but a playmate of the devil! I am acting Number Two
  to C.3. These men spoke for you, or you would now lie smothered in those
  ashes."</p>

  <p>Naked, and the color of coppery-bronze a little reddened by the firelight,
  with a chin like Gandhi's and incredible, steel-rimmed spectacles above a
  thin nose that was almost like the beak of a falcon, sinewy and stronger to
  the eye than whipcord, grinning with the tip of a red tongue thrust through a
  gap in his front teeth, F.9 met Hawkes's stare and mocked his
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"One of these days I'll teach you manners," Hawkes retorted.</p>

  <p>"It is hard to teach an old ape new tricks, sahib. I was learning in
  Chicago how to keep a thumb out of my eye before your honor knew a rubber
  teat from dry dugs. I have word for C.3. Do you take it?"</p>

  <p>F.11 leaned into a cloud of smoke and touched Hawkes's knee.</p>

  <p>"I said it, sahib! Said I not that C.3 has the key to any puzzle that he
  sets up? All we have to do is to obey him, and the plan unfolds! Not
  you&mdash;this man was the one we waited for; and not we&mdash;he is to
  instruct your honor! He stays here with us, and we shall show him what we
  know. But you obey him!"</p>

  <p>"How do I get back to C.3?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"How did I come? How else than by elephant?" said F9. "Did you think there
  is a subway?"</p>

  <p>"Can he swim the river?"</p>

  <p>"Easily, but can you hang on when the river ducks him?"</p>

  <p>"Say, I'd hold fast to a submarine if it 'ud take me to Kutchdullub!
  Where's your elephant?"</p>

  <p>"Down yonder in the jungle."</p>

  <p>"What's your message?"</p>

  <p>"It is for C.3's and no other ears. The elephant's mahout knows
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"O.K. I'll deliver it to C-3&mdash;if I get through. And I'll get through
  if it snows ink."</p>

  <p>"Tell him this, then, sahib: 'F.9 saw the target and reports that many
  shots have missed it, since the marker uses tricks that turn the arrows. But
  the marker is not suspected.' Please repeat that."</p>

  <p>He made Hawkes repeat it three times, then resumed dictation:</p>

  <p>"Add this: 'But the archer, becoming impatient, invents excuses to step
  nearer to the target and assault it with a new bow. Being unpaid, he is eager
  to hit the very heart of the bull's-eye and claim the reward.' Repeat that
  also to me three times, sahib."</p>

  <p>Hawkes repeated it. Then F.9 made him say it all from the beginning,
  interrupting him to test his memory. But Army signaling had made Hawkes good
  at that game.</p>

  <p>"Then add these words, sahib: 'It is high time. Too late is as bad as
  never!'"</p>

  <p>Hawkes stuck his pipe in his pocket and tied a shoelace. Then he buttoned
  his jacket.</p>

  <p>"Say what it means," he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I forgot that." F.9 grinned at him again and leaned into the
  firelight. "Probably it means that C.3 trusted you to come and get the
  message, and that F.9 trusted you to take it! Are you hungry? Are you
  thirsty? There are bread and meat and whisky in Kutchdullub!"</p>

  <p>"Are there! And there's cheese in your guts! You've fair warning. Watch
  yourself, the first time me an' you meet unofficial! You can have it
  Queensberry or catch-as-catch-can&mdash;your choice."</p>

  <p>F.9 chuckled. He stuck out his tongue. "Come along," he answered, "I will
  show you to your elephant. Perambulator for the sahib! Cushions! Let me know
  if the mahout is rude to you and I will slap him!"</p>

  <p>Sticking a fist into his pocket to restrain himself, and setting his rifle
  at safety to prevent an accident that might have looked like an attempt at
  murder, Hawkes crawled out into the darkness. F.9 followed, took him by the
  hand and led him at a half-run, laughing at him when he stumbled &mdash;
  pushing him, pulling him&mdash;seeming to see in the dark like an owl,
  whereas Hawkes saw almost nothing, having stared too long at firelight. He
  could smell an elephant before he saw it; and before he knew how near he was
  or guessed the meaning of F.9's shout he was caught by an elephant's trunk
  and hoisted, kicking, to a lightweight howdah such as sporting princes use
  for speed and distance. And before Hawkes had his breath the elephant was
  crashing through the jungle like a landslide; he had to lie low and cling to
  the howdah to save himself from being brained against low branches. Twice he
  almost lost his rifle. Half a dozen times he threatened the mahout with
  mayhem to persuade him to go slower. He could guess neither time nor
  distance. It was pitch-dark, and the crashing of the elephant through
  undergrowth silenced all other sounds until the roar of the river greeted
  them.</p>

  <p>The great brute did not hesitate. There was a sickening slide, then a
  splash and they were swimming in an unseen maelstrom. The mahout climbed in
  and hung on to the howdah rail. They seemed to spin round in tunnels of
  bewildering spate, in a deafening roar, on a slippery perch that ducked them
  twenty times a minute. And then earthquakes, as the elephant stuck toes into
  the far bank and hove himself up on rotten earth that gave way under him.
  Panic in the blue mud&mdash;the mahout in place again&mdash;a blind crash
  into tents and overturning carts&mdash;a chorus of blasphemous cursing from
  awakened campers&mdash;and they were off again, towards Kutchdullub,
  splashing through the mud at top speed&mdash;full five tons of dark
  anachronism hungry for a hot meal.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER 20</a><br>
  "It will probably be something!"</h2>

  <p class="first">RAM DASS once more donned his blanket and sent a shop
  assistant for a one-horse <i>gharry</i>,* it being too far to walk to the
  Residency, and too wet for his old gray Muscat donkey that he sometimes rode
  and always treated with the sentiment that he seldom allowed to intrude into
  corn or mortgages. Chullunder Ghose rehearsed him while they waited for the
  gharry, going even to the length of telling him what Major Eustace Smith
  would probably say, and how to make Smith angry and afraid without the
  slightest risk of personal retaliation.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>gharry</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a cab, carriage or cart,
  usually horse-drawn. See <i><a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:928.hobson">The
  Hobson Jobson Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"Tell him that you have a telegram of about three thousand words already
  written, that you will take to railhead to avoid State censorship, and send
  to Delhi at your own expense unless he takes immediate steps to check this
  rioting, same being bad for business."</p>

  <p>"It is nice to be able to tell at least a little truth," said Ram Dass.
  "We had better shut our shops if rioting continues."</p>

  <p>"Truth," remarked the babu, "is good. But only that is good of which we
  like the consequences. Use that as the measure of the lies you have to tell,
  and don't be squeamish! On your way you are to stop for just two minutes at
  the office of Ananda Raz, who is a mixture of lawyer and priest, so beware!
  You are to tell him you have absolutely confidential, but positive, news that
  the British-India authorities are intervening; and that, therefore, if the
  priests will tell the people to stop rioting they will soon see a change.
  However, if the rioting continues, there will be investigation and a public
  trial of the culprits."</p>

  <p>Ram Dass nodded. "Kali's priests would dread that."</p>

  <p>"And a riot," said the babu, "is a form of suicide committed by ignorant
  fools at the behest of human jackals in the pay of human tigers, who are much
  worse than the beasts, because they know what they are doing. So let us stop
  these riots. And Ananda Raz can do it. As the priests' attorney he has
  influence enough to make those devils change their tactics."</p>

  <p>"I will talk to him."</p>

  <p>"Two minutes only! He is an attorney; he will totally defeat you if you
  argue with him! Simply say your piece and go away in silence&mdash;to the
  Residency. Go and get into the gharry; it is waiting. Go now."</p>

  <p>As mercurial as the very essence of his native Bengal, Chullunder Ghose
  cracked his knuckles and the joints of his toes inside his slippers. It was
  all he could do to force himself to wait until the merchant was well out of
  sight. There was no sense in letting Ram Dass know too much; he had seen that
  dish-faced fellow squatting near the shop door, but had probably not
  memorized his features; so it was not until the gharry drove away that
  Chullunder Ghose walked past the man and, <i>sotto voce</i>, bade him follow.
  Round the corner, out of sight and earshot of the shop assistants, he turned
  and gave his orders rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Buy bananas; eat them as you run, if you are hungry. Go now swiftly to
  the British Residency. Speak there with the old <i>chuprassy</i>* whom the
  Major sahib uses as a spy. You are to tell him that a rumor is abroad that
  Hawkesey is indignant, and has refused to shoot the tiger because somebody
  has said to Hawkesey that the Major played a dirty trick on him by telling
  Syed-Suraj to instruct Hawkesey to go and shoot the tiger and then to tell
  the Rajah to dismiss him as a scapegoat. Say that over to me."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>chuprassy</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a uniformed doorkeeper;
  also a messenger or servant wearing an official badge. Various sources. For
  more information, see the article <a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:549.hobson">Chuprassy</a>
  in <i>The Hobson Jobson Dictionary</i>. ]</p>

  <p>Dish-face had a number in the C.I.D., so he was not in need of much
  rehearsing. Unimaginably underpaid, he was as keen as he was illiterate, and
  as proud of his job as he seemed to be stupid and humble. He adored the babu.
  When he repeated the message accurately at the second attempt, and the babu
  nodded, his eyes had the mute devotion of a sheepdog's.</p>

  <p>"You are not to say to the chuprassy whence you have that news. But say
  that if it does not reach the Major's ears immediately there will be a new
  chuprassy within three days. If he asks who said that, say a bullfrog told it
  to you. Go then to the palace. Watch what happens. If the Rajah goes away by
  elephant, you are to set on fire as soon as possible the"&mdash;he
  hesitated&mdash;"it must be a very big blaze. It should look like the work of
  rioters. I must be able to see it from far away. And it must kill no one. It
  must not inflict important hardship."</p>

  <p>Dish-face nodded. "I can burn the place I sleep in, sahib. It stands alone
  in a deserted compound at the rear of the palace. It is a great old wooden
  barn, wherein they stored the grass for elephants. But a contractor filled it
  full of grass no elephant would eat, and now the rats are in it, because the
  roof is tight and the grass dry."</p>

  <p>"Atcha. Set it well alight then," said the babu. "I have given you the
  money for your railway ticket. You will not see me again until we meet in
  Delhi."</p>

  <p>"At the usual place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you are not shot by a Rajah's watchman as you run from the
  burning barn. Go now, and be careful."</p>

  <p>But it was the babu who was almost caught off guard and was lucky to keep
  that rendezvous in Delhi. He was almost sizzling with excitement as he
  hurried through the rain on foot towards the barn where Ram Dass kept his
  surplus grain. His theory that typhoons illustrate the nature of all violence
  and that, therefore, the safest place is always in the slowly moving midst of
  the disturbance, may have made him overlook the element of motion of the
  midst. He was no longer in it. Three hundred yards from the barn, with a
  couple of acres of muddy slums to thread his way through and the rain in his
  face, he was suddenly struck on the jaw by a stone as he passed a narrow
  alley between two disreputable houses.</p>

  <p>Ninety-nine men in a hundred might have taken to their heels. But his
  brain was too swift for his instincts.</p>

  <p>"He who hits to kill, hits harder," he reflected. So he dodged into the
  alley whence the stone had come. There was not much more than shoulder room
  between the walls, and rain came pouring from the eaves on both sides,
  forming an ankle-deep stream down the middle. There was no shelter&mdash;no
  cover of any kind, except the buttress of a house wall on the right hand. It
  projected two feet out into the alley-way. He ran towards it. Out from behind
  it sprang the villager who had named himself Silent Shadow. Quicker than the
  shadow of a rat, he knocked the babu off his balance and shoved him
  flat-backed against the wall behind the buttress. Then he smote him in the
  belly.</p>

  <p>"It is too big! Suck it inward! Anyone who passes in the street could see
  it."</p>

  <p>"Where is your elephant?"</p>

  <p>"Where I left him, by the barn of Ram Dass. But your honor ordered me to
  watch who followed. So I noticed that the same men whom I prevented from
  taking that elephant away from Hawkesey&mdash;they, I mean, who found and
  carried in that <i>badmash</i>* whom your honor slew with my club &mdash;
  they four came forth from a guardroom near the palace gate and followed. They
  were very weary men, and they had knives and clubs and pistols. So I said to
  myself, they are up to no good since nobody sends out tired men on a long
  chase but to do that which weariness will urge them to do swiftly."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>badmash</i>&mdash;(Hindi) a crook, a reprobate, a
  criminal, a hooligan. For other meanings, see the <a href=

  Budmash</a> entry in <i>The Hobson Jobson Dictionary</i>. ]</p>

  <p>"Must I listen to a tale about your cleverness?"</p>

  <p>"But I was clever, sahib! I am much the best assistant that your honor
  ever found by good luck! Did your honor not forbid me to have speech with
  them? So what could I do but coax them to have speech with me?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, they spoke. And what then?"</p>

  <p>"Only one of them spoke. The others smote me; and they twisted my arms
  until I had to speak. However, that was all right, and not disobedience at
  all, because I lied to them. It is a well-known fact that lies are nothing
  and the truth can prove them to be nothing. Telling nothing is not speech, so
  I was not disobedient. I told them that your honor saw a woman through a
  window and had called to her to set a signal whenever her husband should be
  away from home. I said she set the signal and I saw it and informed your
  honor; so your honor hurried to the house."</p>

  <p>"Did they believe that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they presently believed it, after I had added certain details. They
  would have broken my toes and fingers if I had not been clever and made them
  believe. I told them how your honor wished to use that woman as a spy, by
  getting her to talk to the zenana servants. So they set an ambush, saying
  they will stop such treason. There they wait, to slit your honor's throat;
  but me they drove away, mistrusting me. They feared I might cry out or make a
  signal and inform your honor. So I came here by way of the back street. And
  here I waited in all this draughty air and rain, as cold and hungry as
  a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"Round the corner. Just round the corner of the next street."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now we shall see if you are fit for permanent employment. Go
  and tell them&mdash;and demand a fee for telling it&mdash;that you have just
  now seen me entering the shop of Ram Dass. If they doubt you, offer to go
  with them."</p>

  <p>"But if they take me to the <i>kana</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will get a meal there and a dry bed. What should you care if you
  sleep in a police cell? We, of our service, sometimes even serve a term in
  jail to hide from enemies."</p>

  <p>There was no more speech between them, but it was as if an ax had fallen
  and severed the thread of the villager's interest. He nodded, but the nod was
  unconvincing. The natural slyness left his eyes and was replaced by a look of
  stolid honesty, which is a danger-sign in yokels. The intangible, perhaps
  magnetic, current that unites two men in one enthusiasm, ceased as suddenly
  as switched-off light; and the villager smiled as he walked away into the
  rain. If he had looked back, he might have noticed that Chullunder Ghose was
  smiling also.</p>

  <p>"He was too good to be true, that villager," remarked the babu to himself.
  "That one is the ninth or the tenth I have tested who was afraid of a cell,
  although crafty enough to fool a hundred constables. Well&mdash;now he sells
  me to the constables, so what next? There are two ends to this alley."</p>

  <p>But the villager knew that; and the babu felt equally certain that the
  villager had decided to betray him. The chances were that two of the police
  would come from either end, so as to catch him whichever way he bolted. But
  to do that, two of them would have to give the other two enough time to run
  round the block of buildings and take up position. Nothing for it but the
  buttress.</p>

  <p>"There is no time now for bad luck! O thou Lord Ganesha,* lift me by the
  short hair! Grip same as it rises!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Ganesha</i> (Hindi)&mdash;The god of wisdom and the
  remover of obstacles, son of Shiva and Parvati, depicted as a short fat man
  with an elephant's head. For more information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i>
  article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha">Ganesha</a>. ]</p>

  <p>It was such a buttress as an ape might clamber easily enough, but it was
  slippery with rain and not an easy climb even for an athlete equipped with
  leg-irons. For the babu it looked like stark impossibility. But he kicked off
  his slippers and stowed them in his waistband. Pudgy-looking fingers and bare
  toes took a grip on cracks and the interstices of weathered bricks. Knees and
  elbows hugged the buttress as a vice hugs lumber, and he went up like a
  jack-o'-ladder in a toyshop, until he swung himself over a low parapet on to
  a flat roof and lay there listening.</p>

  <p>Three minutes later, four men approached from opposite directions and came
  to a halt beneath him. One of them spoke to a fifth man:</p>

  <p>"Well, where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he was here!"</p>

  <p>"You lie, you vermin! I watched this end of the alley."</p>

  <p>Another man spoke: "If that fat brute had escaped at our end, we two
  surely would have seen him running. There is no door here&mdash;no window. He
  could not have hidden. This lying <i>jungli</i> has been fooling us!"</p>

  <p>"I have not, sahibs, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take that, you mud-begotten toad!"</p>

  <p>"And take that, you dog of a liar!"</p>

  <p>"And take that!"</p>

  <p>"And that!"</p>

  <p>"To the <i>kana</i>! We will teach him in the <i>kana</i>!"</p>

  <p>"In a dark cell we will teach him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where a rat or two will gnaw his whip-sores!"</p>

  <p>"He shall eat salt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lots of it, and listen to the splash of water!"</p>

  <p>"Put the handcuffs on him."</p>

  <p>"Hold him while I bruise his insteps! Why should he walk in comfort when
  our feet ache from a long wait on account of his lies?"</p>

  <p>"Ouch&mdash;ohee-ee-yow-oh-h-h-!"</p>

  <p>"Forward, or I'll crack you on the heels, you jungle-hopper!"</p>

  <p>Peering above the parapet, the babu watched them march away down the alley
  in single file, with the villager limping in their midst.</p>

  <p>"Another cull!" he muttered. "What a pity! He was almost all right, that
  one. But the tainted egg becomes a bad egg. That one will become a criminal.
  There is not room for a split hair between those and us; and yet the stars
  are nearer to the earth than they and we to one another! Too bad!"</p>

  <p>Down he went over the parapet, and out the far end of the alley, hurrying,
  and not once glancing backward.</p>

  <p>"I am probably beholden to the god Ganesha," he reflected. "And the gods
  are worse than money-lenders. They collect&mdash;they collect&mdash;they
  collect! So why waste breath on thanks to them? And bombs don't fall twice in
  the same place. Good luck is just like a cold in the head; it runs for three
  days if it isn't squelched the first hour. Three days? I can do it, if only
  Hawkesey hasn't acted like a true-blue Britisher and shot my works away to
  save his character&mdash;or something. It will probably be something."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER 21</a><br>
  "What are good guys for?"</h2>

  <p class="first">COPELAND sat up, in the howdah, smoking, studying the back
  of the mahout's head and admiring the way the rain ran from the roof of the
  enormous barn&mdash;a two-storied affair. The upper part projected and was
  supported on thick wooden posts; it served as shelter from the rain, and the
  smell of the corn and semsem seed and peas was not bad, so that Copeland
  actually was enjoying the long wait. He had hardly realized how tired he was,
  after so many days of incessant and exacting work, until he sat in that
  swaying howdah while the elephant pumped restlessly at an imaginary crank.
  And there was lots to think about&mdash;the Sikh's enthusiasm&mdash;Major
  Eustace Smith's boils and abominable manners&mdash;the riots in front of the
  palace&mdash;this astonishing elephant&mdash;and the babu. Most of all the
  babu. It was like a dream directed by a humorous, fat showman.</p>

  <p>Copeland had ceased to believe or disbelieve. He chuckled over it, enjoyed
  it and pretended to himself that nothing mattered, although at the back of
  his mood was sane sense warning him that things like that don't happen unless
  serious events are stirring underneath the surface.</p>

  <p>"Hell, it's not my funeral!" he reflected. "It's the tiger's if I've luck
  and if the babu isn't lying. He probably is, but who cares? He amuses me, I
  like him, and I shan't mind if he soaks me any reasonable sum of money. All
  I've missed until now is the Rajah, but I'm riding his elephant, so that's
  something. And I don't know where I'm off to, which is even better! Here's
  luck!"</p>

  <p>He drank from his flask, relighted his pipe, and almost fell asleep in the
  gently swaying howdah, with nothing bothering him except mosquitoes and the
  smell of the mahout, who stank of garlic, betelnut and unwashed
  underclothing. He was somewhere between sleeping and waking when a clod of
  earth fell in his lap and the babu called up from beside the elephant:</p>

  <p>"Come down! I have a key to this place, but just look at the cripple from
  whom I took it! Ram Dass probably employs him because he couldn't run away
  with grain-bags!"</p>

  <p>There was a rope suspended from a beam, so Copeland swung himself down by
  that. A half-paralyzed and at least half-insane watchman fled at sight of
  him, limping and writhing round a corner of the building.</p>

  <p>"He would not have let me have the key if I hadn't told him you are sent
  by Ram Dass to remove his legs and arms and have them cured in the United
  States. Let us steal two hundred pounds of grain."</p>

  <p>"I'm willing. But, for God's sake, why?" asked Copeland.</p>

  <p>"Fuel! Number One Welsh for the non-stop special! Elephants are engines
  with the fire-box at the wrong end. Do you like excitement? Look at me then;
  I am essence of it! Come on!"</p>

  <p>Between them they dragged out four bags of the best unhulled rice, and the
  elephant hoisted them into the howdah. Then he lifted Copeland and the babu,
  who addressed the mahout with savage vehemence:</p>

  <p>"You son of evil, I am wet through and ashamed to ride behind a filthy
  drunkard such as you are! So beware of making me more angry than I am
  already! I want speed and plenty of it. If I have to speak again to you about
  it, I will brain you with your ankus and then drive the elephant myself! Get
  going. Take the road towards the river."</p>

  <p>An elephant is one of the fastest things on four legs. Corn-fed and in
  good condition, with his feet well tended, he can out-speed and out-endure
  any mammal that breathes, excepting always, man. He is incomparable in
  squelchy going, if the squelch is only on the surface so that it does not bog
  his great weight. But his head bobs, and his body sways; he is as comfortless
  at high speed as a racing motor-boat in the teeth of a wind-crossed tide. So
  Copeland presently bestowed his breakfast on the blue-black mud that
  smick-smacked to the suck-and-plug of four enormous feet. He was not
  interested in the sandwiches he had brought and that Chullunder Ghose
  appropriated. Optimism oozed away, along with the rain that drooled down from
  the high-peaked howdah-top. It is impossible to vomit and be proud, or even
  to be reasonably vain; so he began to live on obstinacy. Nothing but that
  preserved him from the last disgrace of asking to be set down and left by the
  roadside. At the end of ten miles he would have welcomed a tiger, if the
  brute would only guarantee to kill him.</p>

  <p>However, most people survive even sea-sickness and its equivalent,
  especially men like Copeland, who can laugh at themselves between the
  devastating spasms. Sunset found him sprawling on his back with his eyes
  shut, unable to endure the sight of a revolving universe. One hour after
  sunset he was sitting up and following the babu's gaze across the trees in
  the direction of Kutchdullub.</p>

  <p>They had stopped on high ground, he supposed, to breathe the elephant. But
  except for the great brute's heaving lungs there was no motion now, and
  Copeland's senses came back to resume work almost as swiftly as they had
  deserted him. He saw a column of flame in the distance, and a hell-red
  splurge below the belly of a black cloud. It looked as if a city was
  burning.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked&mdash;his first words since they left
  Kutchdullub.</p>

  <p>"Just a signal," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Looks like rioting to me."</p>

  <p>"It means that things are going much too much like clockwork," the babu
  answered. "I shall begin to suspect disaster unless something goes wrong
  presently."</p>

  <p>"My works have been going wrong," said Copeland with a pale grin.</p>

  <p>"That is not enough, however. In important matters there are always
  errors. To succeed, it is essential to get those errors cleaned up and out of
  the way. If not, the climax catches us with so much to attend to that we act
  like politicians chasing broken pledges with a fish-net. I am worried."</p>

  <p>"Talk sense, can't you? What does the signal mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means that the Rajah has left his palace."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you want that?"</p>

  <p>"I insisted on it! I have used up all my ingenuity to get him to do so. He
  has done it. Now I am afraid."</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"I can imagine only one way now by which he might upset my calculations. I
  imagine that, however; and it makes me feel like being raised the limit by a
  fool who drew one card and may have filled a royal flush."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're calculating. What could he do to upset you? Do
  you suppose he is out after our tiger?"</p>

  <p>"If he isn't, we are flummoxed, sahib, if you know what that means."</p>

  <p>"For the love of Pete, talk sense and then I'll try to understand
  you."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, if he has not had enough to drink to inflame his ego&mdash;which
  is to say, if he has the wind up too badly&mdash;some stray, fluffy little
  shred of common sense still floating in the water on his brain may tempt him
  to disgrace his ancestors and save himself by hurrying across the border into
  British India. If he should do that, and claim protection against his cousin
  and the priests, accusing them of having caused the riots, my work would be
  wasted and the British would have to send for Jack the Ripper to invent a
  reason for not coming to his rescue&mdash;since a treaty is a treaty, even
  among statesmen!"</p>

  <p>"Are you framing him, for God's sake?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he is framed in barbed-wire by his own besotted conduct! It is
  inconvenient to abdicate him, so he must be buried. And he can't be executed,
  so he must be made into a hero."</p>

  <p>"Bumped off?"</p>

  <p>"Much more diplomatic. Have you ever seen a scorpion sting itself to
  death?"</p>

  <p>"Eh? Suicide?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. But allowed to follow causes to their natural conclusion,
  sahib."</p>

  <p>Copeland shied off vigorously. "Dammit, I've no share in this. I won't be
  drawn in. If you'd given me a hint of all this, I'd have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You shall keep your moral feet dry," said the babu. <i>"Cheloh!"</i> he
  commanded, and the elephant resumed its squelching down the pitch-dark lane
  between the jungle and a wilderness of flooded fields.</p>

  <p>Copeland would have liked to argue, but the vertigo seized him again. It
  was not quite so bad as before, but it made speech impossible; so he lay
  still, watching the crimson cloud grow dull-red as the rain descended on the
  fire beneath it. For another hour they swayed amid a sea of forest noises
  into black night. Then a shout&mdash;unmistakably English&mdash;stopped them,
  and Copeland sat up. An electric torch stabbed at the darkness and the
  elephant was bathed in milky white light, striped with parallel lines of
  rain.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hawkesey&mdash;is it Hawkesey?" asked the babu, his voice sonorous
  with emotion.</p>

  <p>The answer was equally sonorous, but the emotion different:</p>

  <p>"Who the hell did you suppose it was? Get down off there&mdash;or let me
  up&mdash;I'm scuppered!"</p>

  <p>"What has happened, Hawkesey?"</p>

  <p>"I've a message for you. Lost my elephant! He went into a panic when a
  buffalo got up and startled him. He crashed into the jungle and brained the
  mahout on a branch; he brained him deader than a doormat. Then he bogged
  himself in a mud-hole, and I jumped. He couldn't climb out. Last I saw of him
  was bubbles, where his trunk blew 'Last Post' through a foot o' stuff like
  blue soup. He'd a bullet in him. Soon as I saw he was there for keeps I shot
  him; then he sank in half a jiffy. That was mid-day. I've been walking ever
  since."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, Hawkesey!" said the babu.</p>

  <p>"What for, dammit?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for getting in the way of trouble! You are a very dependable person,
  Hawkesey! Now I am an optimist! I think that all is well from now on!"</p>

  <p>"Cheese it! Hoist me up there. Any liquor?"</p>

  <p>"Catch!" Copeland summoned strength enough to throw his whisky-flask.
  Hawkes recovered it out of the mud, up-ended it and drained it empty. Then
  the elephant knelt in the mud and Hawkes stared at Copeland by the aid of the
  flashlight while he leaned against the big beast's heaving flank.</p>

  <p>"I hope that whisky wasn't all you had," he said politely. "'Struth, but I
  needed it."</p>

  <p>"I've another bottle," said Copeland.</p>

  <p>"What is the message, Hawkesey?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"F.9&mdash;scarecrow in his birthday trousseau and a pair o' specs. You
  know him?"</p>

  <p>"I have known him when he wore a top-hat, Hawkesey! I have seen him ride a
  bicycle in plus-fours. He is a very important liar. What did F.9 tell
  you?"</p>

  <p>Hawkes delivered the message. "It's as Greek to me," he said, "as algebra.
  He sassed me when I asked him to explain it. Does it mean much?"</p>

  <p>"Hawkesey, yours will be the winning uppercut at Armageddon! Did you shoot
  that tiger?"</p>

  <p>"No chance, dammit! Wish I had! I saw him kill and eat a bloke who asked
  him to! I never saw the like of it. If I'd been drinking I'd have known I had
  the D.T.'s. And I didn't shoot that woman, either; but I will if she ever
  gets in range o' my express!"</p>

  <p>"F.15 and F.11?"</p>

  <p>"On the job. F.9 is with 'em. It was they who tied me so I couldn't shoot
  the tiger."</p>

  <p>"God reward them for it! Hawkesey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What now?"</p>

  <p>"Are you all in?"</p>

  <p>"You're a Pharaoh, that's what you are! Do you think I'm a blinkin'
  Israelite to go on making blinkin' bricks for you without no blinkin' straw?
  I want supper and sleep."</p>

  <p>"That message, Hawkesey, means that your employer has been paying a
  physician from Madras to poison his cousin. But because that cousin, Prince
  Jihangupta, has a body-servant who is loyal; and because F.9 explained the
  danger to that body-servant, something else was substituted for the poison.
  So the doctor from Madras is seeking other means of killing him, and we must
  hurry to prevent it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not stopping you," Hawkes answered. "I can reach home on foot all
  right, if I take it easy. Got a sandwich?"</p>

  <p>"Your employer, Hawkesey, is behind us. Or at least, I hope he is behind
  us. He will not come quite so fast as we did, being fonder of his
  comforts."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it. Elephants give him a gut-ache. When he rides 'em you'd
  think he was going to his own funeral."</p>

  <p>"He may be going to it, Hawkesey. Who knows?"</p>

  <p>"Hey? What? Someone set an ambush for him? Maybe I'd better wait right
  here and warn him as he goes by!"</p>

  <p>"Wait, yes. But there isn't any ambush, Hawkesey. Nobody will kill him.
  Tell him all that you have seen within that temple. But neglect to tell him
  that you know he ordered you to shoot the tiger, with intent to sack you
  afterwards for having committed sacrilege by entering a sacred and forbidden
  place!"</p>

  <p>"The hell he did!"</p>

  <p>"It is as true as that I sit here," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Then he's worse than I took him for!"</p>

  <p>"Lot's worse, Hawkesey."</p>

  <p>"And he'll sack me anyhow, if I admit I've been into the temple. Sacred
  places are expressly mentioned in the contract; I mayn't touch 'em."</p>

  <p>"So we understand each other. Had I asked you not to tell him what you saw
  in there, we might have argued half a night about it! You are quite right;
  you would be a fool to tell him."</p>

  <p>"What then?"</p>

  <p>"Say that you have heard his cousin will be there at daybreak."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"To destroy the tiger and to get the credit."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't heard it."</p>

  <p>"Are you deaf? I told it to you. You may say I told it to you. You may say
  I am encouraging his cousin to get up out of bed and to steal a march on him
  and kill that tiger for the sake of gaining popularity, and, at the same
  time, putting hooks into the priests of Kali, who will have to behave after
  that, or else be shown up. You may tell the Rajah I am very angry with him
  for his several attempts to have me murdered."</p>

  <p>"How can I speak civil to him?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>The babu leaned out of the howdah, thrusting his face into the rays from
  the flashlight.</p>

  <p>"Be a good sport, Hawkesey! You have done so perfectly that I am prouder
  of you than a cuckoo that has laid a fresh egg in a foul nest! Don't go now
  and spoil it! Swallow anger for the sake of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn you, I'll do anything for you," said Hawkes, "so cut the Sunday
  sermon. I'll wait here and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Offer to go with him to the temple and to help him kill that tiger!"</p>

  <p>"Did you hear me say I'm all in?"</p>

  <p>"Play the little gentleman, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>"Dogged does it, Hawkesey! Here are seven sandwiches. But drink
  rain&mdash;no more whisky! And expect me when you see me. I depend on you to
  be a true-blue British bulldog of the sort whose ignorance is priceless, and
  whose errors are so honest that the gods convert them into pitfalls for the
  enemy!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>, Hawkesey!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Bong swoir!</i> And the same to you, sir. Thank you for the
  snifter."</p>

  <p>Then the elephant rose to its feet like something rocked up by an
  earthquake, and resumed the sucking, plugging sway into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"It's a hell of a night to leave a good guy sitting in the rain," said
  Copeland.</p>

  <p>"What are good guys for?" the babu answered. "To be put in paper wrappers
  in a glass case?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER 22</a><br>
  "You shall drink with it to your own health, you devil!"</h2>

  <p class="first">PICTURES burned themselves from then on into Copeland's
  mind. They were lurid, with gaps between them, like the midnight glimpses
  from a railway window. Some of them were like remembered fragments of a
  nightmare. There was one where the elephant swam the river; part of it was a
  fantastic fight in darkness with a tree that whirled down-flood. It entangled
  the elephant's legs; he tried to dive beneath it, and its branches caught the
  howdah trappings. Tree and elephant at last were flung against the far
  bank.</p>

  <p>Then there was a two-hour wait beside a smoky bonfire while they fed the
  elephant on wet rice; and a little whisky for his disposition. Copeland dried
  and cleaned his rifle by the intermittent glow of firelight, coughing and
  rubbing the smart of the smoke from his eyes. The mahout refused further duty
  at that stage, until he was beaten with a fire-brand by the babu, who
  threatened to kick him into the fire and leave him there. He meant it. He
  clutched him by the beard and throat and forced him backwards. The mahout
  capitulated and was given about an ounce of whisky.</p>

  <p>Then on again, into the folds of foothills, where the trees went by like
  black ghosts. There the going became rocky and the elephant's tired feet
  began to hurt him, but he was driven mercilessly.</p>

  <p>"Show me man or beast who doesn't have to suffer at some time without
  knowing why," said the babu in answer to Copeland's protests. "Most of us
  suffer without reward, but this big simpleton will get a hot mash, with some
  sugar in it, and a gallon of arrack."</p>

  <p>Measureless and timeless darkness&mdash;then an oil-lamp throwing wet
  light on a gate amid enormous trees. A gate-house, and a sleepy gate-man with
  his turban all awry, who sulkily refused admission.</p>

  <p>"I will crash that gate, you son of sixty dogs!" the babu yelled at him.
  He ordered the mahout to charge it, head-on, but the gate-man ran into the
  gate-house for his key and let them pass in. Then a winding drive amid a
  dumpy maze of feathery bamboo and scented shrubs. A dark house. One dim light
  beneath a portico. A huge bell, that the babu tolled like the knell of
  hastened destiny. An angry group of servants at a dark door&mdash;one wax
  taper, and a voice like a barking watchdog's.</p>

  <p>"He is ill. You may wait outside until the morning. This is no time to
  disturb His Highness."</p>

  <p>"Shall I shoot my way in?" asked the babu. He seized the bell-rope &mdash;
  sent a clangor through the night that brought another group of servants on
  the run from the stables and out-houses. Some of them brought ladders and a
  chemical fire-engine. Light after light appeared at curtained windows; one
  jerked open with a screech of unoiled hinges and a voice called:</p>

  <p>"What now? What the devil is it?"</p>

  <p>"An important message from His Highness the Rajah of Kutchdullub!" the
  babu shouted, and the window slammed shut.</p>

  <p>Then the doctor from Madras appeared in the doorway, in his blue suit and
  his watch-chain, with his necktie loose. His black beard looked as if he had
  been sleeping on it.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;I want you!" said the babu. The elephant knelt. He climbed out.
  "Come here&mdash;and talk English, or you may regret it!" Then he drove a
  group of servants out of earshot and beckoned the man from Madras to the side
  of the howdah. He approached with hesitation, that he tried to offset with an
  air of insolent importance.</p>

  <p>"You?" he said, folding his arms on his chest. "I know you well by sight.
  Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"No one of the least importance," said the babu. "I am from His Highness
  of Kutchdullub, who is not pleased. You are too slow! He has sent another
  doctor&mdash;this one&mdash;who must see the Prince instanter!"</p>

  <p>"He is too ill."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear me?"</p>

  <p>"Have you it in writing?"</p>

  <p>"Do you take His Highness for a born fool? You are to receive your payment
  in a certain place at daybreak. After that you may go to the devil. I will
  take you to the place, and I will be a witness that you are paid-in
  full&mdash;as a precaution against blackmail!"</p>

  <p>"I have never heard of such indignity. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>An acetylene light in the hall was turned on suddenly. A very weary
  looking man with strange eyes, in a yellow turban and a yellow robe of
  flowered silk, came and stood in the doorway. He was shadowed by a servant
  ready to support him; as he appeared to fear his master might fall backwards.
  Chullunder Ghose promptly salaamed with both hands to his forehead. Behind
  them he whispered to Copeland:</p>

  <p>"Get out of the howdah!"</p>

  <p>He almost pulled Copeland out. He hustled him towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Prince Jihangupta," he said, "it is my privilege to introduce to Your
  Highness Doctor Copeland of the United States of America who comes in great
  haste&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why?" the Prince asked, staring. He appeared not to see distinctly.
  Copeland muttered one word: "Digitalis!"</p>

  <p>"He congratulates you!" said the babu.</p>

  <p>"I am flattered. But on what account does he congratulate me&mdash;and at
  this hour?"</p>

  <p>"Her Majesty Queen Victoria had to be haled out of bed by Lord Melbourne
  to be told she had succeeded to a throne," the babu answered. "So we have a
  precedent to go on. May we speak to Your Highness in private?"</p>

  <p>The Prince swayed, but the servant caught his elbows. Then he turned on
  his heel and led the way into a small room, where his servant lighted
  candles. It was furnished almost like a monastery cell&mdash;wood-paneled,
  severe, no ornaments, a vaulted ceiling. The servant remained; he merely
  withdrew into a corner at a sign from the Prince and stood still and
  alert&mdash;a very old man with a young one's quickness.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it? Is my cousin dead?" the Prince asked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said the babu.</p>

  <p>Copeland interrupted: "You will be, unless you listen to me! How much
  digitalis have you taken?"</p>

  <p>"But it was not digitalis!" said the Prince, and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Let me see your wrist," said Copeland. He did not touch it; he could see
  the tell-tale needlemark from where he stood. "How many shots have you
  had?"</p>

  <p>"Two. He&mdash;my doctor&mdash;says that two more will restore my health
  entirely."</p>

  <p>"Send that servant for my bag," said Copeland. But the servant said his
  say then. He was voluble and he even shed tears. Chullunder Ghose
  interpreted:</p>

  <p>"Who am I to know about such matters? But I know that these hurt no one,
  so I substituted these for what the doctor gave him&mdash;and he lives!"</p>

  <p>The servant produced a tin box from his sash. On its cover, in big white
  words, were the name and the claim of a patent capsule so notorious that
  reputable druggists will not sell it and some governments refuse to let it
  pass their frontiers. He went on with his story, and Chullunder Ghose
  interpreted:</p>

  <p>"Today he took a little syringe. What could I do? And he squirted
  something into the Bahadur's arm. He did it twice. And now what? Will he die
  in spite of all my watching?"</p>

  <p>"Tell him to bring my bag," commanded Copeland.</p>

  <p>But the servant was afraid to leave his master, so Copeland himself went
  for the bag, and that took several minutes, because the mahout had taken the
  elephant towards the stables and was busy arguing about accommodations. When
  he returned he found the babu talking to the Prince like an auctioneer to a
  baulky bidder. He caught the end of a sentence:</p>

  <p>"You are not the first Prince I have talked to! If it isn't priests, it's
  money-lenders! If it isn't drink, it's women! I am nothing but a babu, but I
  don't keep my brains in my belly, and I will ruin you unless you listen to
  me!"</p>

  <p>Copeland poured a tumbler nearly full of brandy. "Drink that," he
  commanded.</p>

  <p>"But I never drink. It is against my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Drink it!"</p>

  <p>Then the doctor from Madras came in, his beard brushed and his necktie
  properly adjusted. He watched the Prince screw up his face as he drank; and
  he smiled as the Prince wiped teeth and lips with a purified handkerchief to
  offset the defilement from Copeland's touch. Then he shrugged his
  shoulders:</p>

  <p>"My responsibility has ceased! If that man's medicines should kill
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How much did my cousin offer you to poison me?" the Prince asked; and
  before he could answer the babu turned and faced him:</p>

  <p>"Tell it when the Rajah pays you, dog of a hypnotist! Dog of a murderer!
  You are coming with us!"</p>

  <p>The Madrasi turned towards the door, but the babu seized him and flung him
  backwards almost half across the room. Then he glanced at the Prince, and
  from him to Copeland.</p>

  <p>"Can he travel?"</p>

  <p>Copeland nodded. "Violent exercise is what he most needs. Put him on an
  elephant and sway him. That and the brandy ought to overcome the
  digitalis."</p>

  <p>"Will Your Highness give the necessary orders?" asked the babu, and the
  Prince staggered out of the room on the arm of his servant.</p>

  <p>Then Chullunder Ghose nudged Copeland and the two of them faced the
  Madrasi. He showed his teeth; his hand was in his right hip-pocket. They
  approached him closer.</p>

  <p>"If you have a pistol, draw it!" said the babu. Suddenly he kicked him,
  pounced and seized him by the arms. "You take his pistol, Doctor sahib!"</p>

  <p>The Madrasi had no pistol. In his right hip-pocket were a hypodermic
  syringe in a silver case that also held a phial of digitalis, and a screw-lid
  wooden box that looked as if it might hold ink for refilling a fountain pen.
  Copeland opened it. He found a small glass bottle, drew the cork and sniffed
  once:</p>

  <p>"Prussic acid!"</p>

  <p>The Madrasi wilted. "Let me have that!" he said in a harsh voice. "It will
  save trouble for us all!"</p>

  <p>Copeland gave the poisons to the babu. It was not his business. But he was
  curious. "Any ground-glass in the Prince's stomach?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, no," said the Madrasi. "He has ulcers and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The babu interrupted: "Pah! The Prince is nothing but a hypochondriac, and
  morbid! He had belly-ache, and this man hypnotized him to believe it was
  ulcers! This man is a specialist, I tell you. Too many of his patients die of
  overdoses of some drug or other! Yet he has no money; he is blackmailed by
  the undertakers and the servants of the heirs who pay him to murder a rich
  relation!"</p>

  <p>"You are a fat and filthy liar!" the man from Madras said savagely through
  tight lips.</p>

  <p>"Tell that to the Rajah! Are you coming with us? Shall I tie you?" asked
  the babu.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me; I will let you have that Prussic acid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Give it to me!"</p>

  <p>"You shall drink with it to your own health, you devil, if you will accuse
  the Rajah to his face, before us all, of having bribed you to murder the
  Prince!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! Two sides of the same coin! He will simply shoot me."</p>

  <p>"Otherwise, you go to prison," said the babu, "and await what happens in
  the prison to a man whom the police of this State find it inconvenient to
  send to trial!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER 23</a><br>
  "A tiger comes quick as a punch in the eye!"</h2>

  <p class="first">HAWKES, with is head on a tree-stump and his rifle on his
  knees, fast asleep on a fallen monument beside the temple pool, snored louder
  than the bullfrogs. Sun was rising very dimly through a gray mist and the
  pool was like a mirror ruined by the damp&mdash;no ripple on it, but a
  patchwork of leaden lanes with silver-gray between them. Kali's temple
  drooled, gray-ugly; it was like an ant-heap, except that the mist made
  semi-luminous the green of its marauding foliage, redeeming it a little. Two
  huge elephants &mdash; blue-black phantoms looking twice their real
  size&mdash;swayed amid trees at the edge of the jungle. Out of sight of
  those, but visible from where Hawkes lay, two other elephants stood
  stock-still waiting to be told to kneel and be unloaded; they were on the
  opposite side of the temple&mdash;away from the river. A mynah-bird squinted
  at Hawkes from a burned stump, scolded at something&mdash;and took wing.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been sleeping, Hawkesey?"</p>

  <p>Hawkes sat up, gripping his rifle. Seconds passed before he recognized
  Chullunder Ghose. The babu sat six paces off, facing the temple but
  camouflaged by tree-stumps and a bunch of tall grass. Hawkes yawned.</p>

  <p>"Thought you'd gone and lost yourself," he answered. "It's a pity you
  didn't. Things look enough like hell to pay, without your adding to 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me."</p>

  <p>"The Rajah's drunk. He was afraid to cross the river, though he's
  generally bull-rash when the liquor's in him. Damned if I think he'd ha'
  crossed if he weren't so bent on shooting you. He hates you worse than he
  does his cousin. I'm next. I'd ha' betted a hundred dibs he'd try to shoot me
  when I told him what you said to tell him."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Yonder by the elephants. There's seven servants with him, not including
  the mahouts. It takes two of 'em to keep the champagne iced and ready for His
  Highness; and at that he never offered me a drink, the stinker&mdash;not even
  when I took an elephant and three men, crossed the river to the village,
  stole a rope and made a raft o' goatskins, sent that over on the elephant,
  and towed him across&mdash;in the dark, mind! He's as drunk as two coots.
  Killing drunk. His eyes 'ud burn a hole in sheet-iron. I came over here to be
  out o' harm's way. I don't want to have to shoot him&mdash;not even in
  self-defense. I'd sooner hook it."</p>

  <p>"Stand by, Hawkesey!" said the babu. "I am needing all the courage I can
  beg or borrow!"</p>

  <p>"What's up?"</p>

  <p>"I have brought the Rajah's cousin! I have also brought the doctor from
  Madras who has been poisoning the Prince! I have him tied into a howdah,
  between Doctor Copeland&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who's he?"</p>

  <p>"U.S.A. You saw him and you drank his whisky. He is pukka. Between Doctor
  Copeland and a servant who would give both eyes for leave to torture him to
  death; but I have other uses for the doctor from Madras."</p>

  <p>"You'd better use him quick," said Hawkes. "It's getting daylight, and the
  Rajah's up to dirt o' some sort. Give him about one more quart o' champagne
  and then watch him!"</p>

  <p>"Is the woman in the temple?"</p>

  <p>"Lord knows."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen F.9?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"He has seen us," said the babu. "He has set a signal."</p>

  <p>"Which? Where is it?"</p>

  <p>The babu pointed to a red rag hanging from the limb of a tree amid the
  temple ruins. "That means he has seen us and that the tiger is in there."</p>

  <p>"There are two of 'em," Hawkes answered. "One's a female. She's behind
  bars."</p>

  <p>"No, she isn't," said the babu. "F.9 had his orders. If there was a way of
  letting out that tigress he has done it."</p>

  <p>"How did you know about a tigress?" Hawkes asked sulkily. "You sent me to
  discover how they&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I could not imagine any other way of getting a loose tiger to return home
  after killing somebody, Hawkesey. So I told F.9 to look for one, and, if she
  happened to be caged, to loose her."</p>

  <p>"Why? Which are you&mdash;drunk or off your nut, you fat fool?"</p>

  <p>"Listen, Hawkesey. I have done a good job. It is too long to explain in
  detail, but by choosing a critical moment to spring a surprise, and by dint
  of impudence and luck and argument as forceful as a ton of T.N.T., I have
  convinced a pious and perfectly harmless Prince that it is up to him to
  assert himself. And Doctor Copeland has inserted ginger into him in little
  capsules. He must act, however, before lethargy sets in again, or he will
  think he has an ulcer in the stomach and must lie down."</p>

  <p>"What's the program?" Hawkes asked.</p>

  <p>"I have told him he must shoot that tiger, since the Rajah has refused to
  do it. He is ritually clean, and therefore he can go into the temple without
  involving himself in a charge of sacrilege. And after he has seen what he has
  seen, he will be able to compel the priests of Kali to behave, for fear of an
  exposure of their goings-on. And the Rajah will follow him into the temple. I
  will be there. And the doctor from Madras will be there. F.9, F.15 and F.11
  will be there also. That's all."</p>

  <p>"Don't you kid yourself!" Hawkes answered. "That's not half of it! There's
  Major Eustace Smith across the river, boils and all! There's him and Ram
  Dass. Ram Dass hired an elephant and brought him, and they're both afraid to
  cross the river. So they're setting there, top o' the elephant, afraid to wet
  their feet and cracking on like two old cronies. Smith's as mad as a man with
  corns in tight boots. No doubt Ram Dass likes to see him that way."</p>

  <p>Suddenly the babu beat his head and breast and struck clenched fists
  together.</p>

  <p>"Dammit, Hawkesey! Why did I up-shoot Ganesha? Listen! Bear me witness. I
  will give the god Ganesha, for his temple in Benares, rupees fifty to convert
  this into good luck! Does the Rajah know about this?"</p>

  <p>"Not he. You remember sending me a note about a villager you wanted me to
  take home on the elephant? I took him, but it seems he returned to
  Kutchdullub, on the same elephant, after its damned mahout rode off and left
  me. He fell foul of the police in some way; they arrested him and gave him
  hell. But he escaped 'em somehow and ran to the Residency, where he found Ram
  Dass and told him a long yarn about you being gone on an elephant to find me
  and look for treasure in this here temple. Can you beat it? Smith was furious
  and fetched the villager along, so's to be able to prove to the Rajah that
  you and I are behaving without any orders from him. And Ram Dass came along
  to make sure Smith pays for the elephant."</p>

  <p>"Who told you, Hawkesey?"</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;the villager himself. He swam the river, and he found me. He's
  as proud of what he told 'em as a dog with two tails. Now he's in the
  temple."</p>

  <p>"Did he say why?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's you he's looking for. He says he knows you're in there."</p>

  <p>"Did he say why he wants me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He said he'd saved your life a time or two, and if he saves it
  again, perhaps you'll hire him permanent."</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose sighed. "Oh, well, there are always difficulties! This
  was too good to last. I should have known that villager would get into the
  wheels and ditch the train!"</p>

  <p>"Tiger may kill him," said Hawkes.</p>

  <p>"I hope so! Oh, I hope so! Hawkesey, the Rajah is not so very drunk. I see
  him."</p>

  <p>"He is so drunk that he's icy-sober," Hawkes insisted. "See him? He walks
  like a man in a dream. And he's alone; he's left his servants! Know what? I
  believe he thinks the Prince is in there, and he wants no witnesses! He's
  killing-crazy, that's what he is!"</p>

  <p>"And he has no rifle with him," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Automatics&mdash;two of 'em&mdash;in holsters," Hawkes answered. "He
  knows he's no good with a rifle."</p>

  <p>"How does he know the way in, Hawkesey?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, I told him! I got sick of lying, so I told him good and plain I'd
  been inside. He made me tell him ten times how to find the hole that I went
  in by. You can see it from here; you can see where my smoke blackened up the
  stonework. Can he see your elephants?"</p>

  <p>"He isn't looking," said the babu. "Hawkesey, do you know another
  entrance? Which way does the tiger take?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mistake me for a blinkin' lunatic?" Hawkes asked him. "Do you
  think I asked the tiger? There's a tunnel that he uses; Smarty F.9 maybe took
  a chance and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Blocked it!" said a thin voice, so near in the knee-high grass that
  Hawkes turned two shades paler. He looked haggard, anyhow, unshaven and with
  dark rings under his eyes. But the babu sat unmoved. He did not even turn his
  head when F.9's spectacles appeared through parted grass.</p>

  <p>"I have been waiting for you," he said. "You are almost too late."</p>

  <p>"Time enough," said F.9. "I have blocked the tunnel to keep that tiger in.
  And I have loosed the tigress; it was possible to raise a stone bar from
  above by climbing carefully along a cornice. Now they are both in the pit in
  the midst, and they are raging thirsty. The tunnel mouth is only blocked with
  stones and branches, so they may escape unless you set a gun there."</p>

  <p>"Any other way in?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"Yes; the way that I came."</p>

  <p>"Where are F.15 and F.11?"</p>

  <p>"Shadowing the Rajah. Acting holy. Waiting to betray to him the
  passages&mdash;in silence. They are supposed to be under a vow of
  silence."</p>

  <p>"Safe stuff, silence, always," said the babu. "Let us hope he doesn't
  shoot them for it! There he goes now. He has gone in. Quick, come with me!
  Come on, Hawkesey!"</p>

  <p>Several minutes later Hawkes and the babu posted Copeland on a big rock
  that commanded, at a range of less than fifty yards, a tunnel entrance on the
  far side of the temple from the hole that Hawkes knew. It was partly choked
  by fallen masonry, and the remaining space was jammed with branches.</p>

  <p>"It's a bad light," Hawkes said, "and a tiger comes quick as a punch in
  the eye. So don't wait. Plug him if you see a tuft o' hair between those
  sticks. He'll bust through there as sure as Christmas. Five shots to your
  magazine? Good. Give him all of 'em, and then reload quick&mdash;same as if
  you was seeing a girl home in Chicago and the bandits asking for your small
  change."</p>

  <p>"I have kept my promise," said the babu. "I have given you a chance at
  tiger, Doctor sahib. It is up to you to kill him! Come on, Hawkesey, let us
  put our Prince into a hat and see what comes out! Too bad there is not an
  audience. I love an audience when tricks click!"</p>

  <p>"Cheese it! Take me for a clown like you are?" Hawkes retorted. "Me, I'm
  out o' bounds and acting foolish. What's more, I can't keep my eyes open, let
  alone shoot! If we come out o' this alive&mdash;oh, hell&mdash;come on, let's
  get it over with!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER 24</a><br>
  "Simple! Since they wished it, why not?"</h2>

  <p class="first">F.9 led. Hawkes followed him, for no especial reason except
  that he might get a chance to retaliate for F.9's cheek, as he regarded it.
  Next came the Prince's servant, on the watch for snakes and fussily
  suspicious of the entire proceedings. Then the Prince, with a repeating rifle
  that he fingered with an air of knowing how to use it; but he looked as if he
  felt the effort was beneath his dignity, and he walked as if he felt too
  fragile to exert himself much. Chullunder Ghose came next, unarmed, untidy,
  corpulent, unshaven, weary-looking, but sturdily strutting his weight on huge
  thighs. He was wearing his loin-cloth tucked up, workmanlike. And he was
  talkative, perhaps to keep himself awake, but every word was aimed directly
  at the Prince's lethargy or at the pale mood of the doctor from Madras, who
  walked beside him. The Madrasi spoke once:</p>

  <p>"If I should run, and were shot as I run, would that not save trouble for
  us all?"</p>

  <p>"I am not your executioner," the babu answered. "I am not your judge, and
  I am not the jury. I arrange the pieces for the gods to play with. I have set
  there quite a puzzle, and I think I know the answer. But it may end by your
  being Rajah of Kutchdullub! Who knows?"</p>

  <p>"Bargain with me. I will give you evidence against the Rajah."</p>

  <p>"Bargain with the gods," the babu answered. "Priests will tell you the
  price."</p>

  <p>To the Prince he was a calculating irritant. He lectured him as if they
  were a small boy and a master of a sternly managed truant school.</p>

  <p>"The modern state of mass-intelligence does call for figureheads on
  thrones, no doubt of it. But a king is a king, and dignity is not attained by
  being hypnotized into a death-bed. What is the use of morals, if you let a
  drunken blackguard get away with murder? You are like a rabbit that waits for
  a weasel to bleed it to death because it knows a weasel does that sort of
  thing. You can't help having royal blood in you, but you can make the best of
  it."</p>

  <p>The Prince kept silence, although his eyes glowed with anger. He showed no
  nervousness when F.9 led them into what had formerly been cloistered passages
  and now were trash-encumbered channels leading between broken walls. There
  was a practicable footpath, winding amid roots and debris&mdash;only room for
  single file, and the babu made the Madrasi walk ahead of him. There began to
  be broken arches&mdash;sections of unfallen roof&mdash;until at last F.9
  pulled out a lighted lantern from behind a fallen statue. Then he scrambled,
  almost like a hairless monkey, up a pile of fallen masonry into a dark hole
  in a thick wall. There Prince Jihangupta hesitated and his servant tried to
  make him turn back, but the babu mocked and Hawkes said, "Maybe he's
  forgotten his galoshes." So the Prince found unsuspected energy and went up
  like a front-rank man into a breached fort.</p>

  <p>Then there were interminable passages, and no one spoke because the echo
  of their footsteps was a solemn, horrifying noise that made the blood run
  cold. It sounded like the voices of the shadows put to flight by F.9's
  lantern. And the bats were like dead men's memories of evil, wakened for a
  moment's panic by a light that broke on peaceless dreams. There was an acrid
  stench of bat-dirt and then, presently, pervading it and blending with it,
  the appalling reek of rotting bones and tigers' ordure. But at last a row of
  clean cells, doorless, in a carved wall representing Kali's orgies of
  annihilation; and another lantern; and the saffron smocks of F.15 and F.11
  dimly looming in a broken archway at the far end of the passage.</p>

  <p>F.9 spoke to them in whispers that went murmuring away into the silence
  like the rumble of muffled wheels. Then he beckoned. Chullunder Ghose shoved
  the Madrasi in front of him, pushed past the other three and joined the
  conference. The sweat of fear was dripping from him, but he governed his
  voice and himself, not trembling. The Madrasi, too, was either proof against
  hysteria or else beyond it, numb-brave as a gallows-passenger to unknown
  regions, on his last march.</p>

  <p>"Soonya?" asked the babu, making almost no sound; but the echo of it
  multiplied itself in hollow darkness and an underworld said
  "Soony-oony-oony," as if secret messengers were calling her from her
  forgotten tomb.</p>

  <p>"Soonya saw him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Saw him, saw him," said the echo.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and she ran and summoned all her holy candidates for death. They
  tried to terrify him, but we hid him in the chamber where we hid Hawkes. And
  he is <i>hokeema mut</i>; the liquor crazes him and he is unafraid. He seeks
  his cousin. He will slay his cousin. He will throw him to the tigers."</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose lost patience. "Never mind that. Tell me what
  happened."</p>

  <p>"Came the noises you made, and they echo like tramping of armies all
  converging on a center. There is no guessing whence a sound comes. Soonya
  cried out that the Rajah's men are here to stop the sacrifice and make an end
  of Kali's mercy, and she summoned them to bring their little lamps while
  there is yet time. Then the Rajah threatened us with pistols, so we let him
  go forth. He is wandering in darkness."</p>

  <p>"Hurry! Lead us to Soonya's charnel-house!" the babu ordered.</p>

  <p>They were swift, and the noise of their feet was a tumult as loud as the
  quarreling roar of a torrent that vanishes into a mountain. Shadows fled
  before them in enormous frog-leaps, until, rosy-red on masonry, a torch-flare
  lit the darkness as they turned an angle. In a moment then they pressed on
  one another's heels into a stinging tiger-stench and stood grouped on a
  platform whence the broken gallery projected over one-third of the
  circumference of Soonya's dreadful pit.</p>

  <p>There was a row of little lamps along the gallery. A row of ghosts &mdash;
  ghouls&mdash;vultures&mdash;sat between them. Perched on her pillar of
  marble, Soonya stood brandishing a flaring torch and shaking sparks into the
  pit, where four eyes glittered opal-colored in the coal-hole darkness. Soonya
  screamed. The row of little lamps went out as suddenly as if her scream had
  switched them, and she flung her torch into the pit. It spiraled, blazing red
  and yellow, and she followed it, spread like a home-coming Harpy embracing a
  spirit of hell in her shadowy arms.</p>

  <p>Then, one by one, as frogs seek water when a footstep startles them, the
  owners of the clay lamps sprang into the dark pit. There was one
  scream&mdash;then a sound of struggle amid dry bones and the snarl of tigers.
  The Madrasi said the first word: "Simple! Since they wished it, why not?"</p>

  <p>Hawkes clicked his pocket flashlight, swearing: "Just my cursed luck! It's
  played out, dammit!" F.9 swung a lantern over darkness, but it made no depth
  of light; it seemed to set a yellow halo swimming on a sea of black pitch;
  and beneath that there was growling horror.</p>

  <p>Suddenly F.15 and F.9 raised their lanterns and a pale light framed the
  broken entrance-gap. It shone on an English shooting-jacket&mdash;and a pair
  of nickel-plated automatics held in lean hands&mdash;and on the dark eyes and
  the self-admiring, sly smile of the Rajah of Kutchdullub.</p>

  <p>"Caught you!" he remarked. His eyes were on the babu and he aimed both
  pistols at him. "Dog of a meddlesome Bengal rice-rat!"</p>

  <p>"My turn!" said the babu. "Oh, well."</p>

  <p>F.15 and F.11 drew away their lanterns. F.9 smothered his in something.
  But there was light enough still. The Rajah lingered on his aim, enjoying the
  amazement on the babu's face, not guessing why the babu stood so still and
  breathless. Suddenly a slim black shadow flicked out from the darkness at the
  Rajah's back. It bunted him off balance, snatched both pistols from his hands
  and sent them spinning down into the dark pit. Naked&mdash;grinning &mdash;
  confident&mdash;the villager, a broken handcuff on his right wrist, stepped
  up and saluted the babu like impudence addressing dignity.</p>

  <p>"So now I am your honor's friend again!"</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose thrust him aside; he had no time for pleasantries. The
  Rajah's cousin was in shadow behind Hawkes and F.9; now the villager's black
  body added one more to the protecting screen. The Rajah tried to step back
  through the opening, but F.15 and F.11 stepped behind him and prevented. He
  made rather a brave figure of a man, at bay with folded arms. The babu pushed
  the doctor from Madras towards him.</p>

  <p>"Your turn!"</p>

  <p>"Well, well!" said the Rajah.</p>

  <p>The Madrasi seemed as unemotional as ice. His attitude was almost casual,
  his voice as calm as if he passed a good check through a banker's window.</p>

  <p>"We are found out."</p>

  <p>"Are we?" said the Rajah.</p>

  <p>"But I don't choose you should leave me to suffer the sole blame. I accuse
  you of having bribed me to poison your cousin."</p>

  <p>"You yelp like the pi-dog you are," said the Rajah. "Where is he?" There
  were death-sounds in the darkness&mdash;groans now, and a noise of struggle.
  "Is he down there?"</p>

  <p>The Madrasi went a step nearer. "You deny it?"</p>

  <p>"Damn you, yes, you liar!" said the Rajah, and he struck him. The Madrasi
  clutched the Rajah's wrists and forced him backwards along the broken
  gallery. The Rajah's cousin forced himself out between Hawkes and F.9, pushed
  past Chullunder Ghose and ran towards them.</p>

  <p>"Stop that!" he commanded. But he paused and let an enigmatically lean
  smile linger on his lips as F.11&mdash;lantern held high&mdash;ran, too late,
  along the gallery. The lantern lit the Rajah's face. He saw his cousin. The
  Madrasi tripped him and leaned on him, bending him backwards, but agony
  changed to maniac, stark hatred on the Rajah's face as his eyes blazed at his
  cousin and he fell, with the Madrasi clinging to him, somersaulting down into
  the stinking darkness. They were striking at each other as they fell.</p>

  <p>Then pandemonium was loose. The pit became a pool of frightful tumult.
  Lanterns swinging from the gallery suggested unseen horrors hidden amid
  shadows heavier than waves of dark oil. There were yells and the guttural
  snarls of brutes made frantic by thirst and the fury of slaying. Hawkes's
  voice shouted, "Get a rope and let me down there! Maybe he's alive yet. I
  can't see a dam' thing." Then the Rajah's cousin began shooting&mdash;at
  random&mdash;at nothing&mdash;blindly&mdash;each flash showing fragments of a
  scene like Dante's vision of the pits at the Inferno.</p>

  <p>Hawkes snatched F.9's turban&mdash;then Chullunder Ghose's&mdash;then the
  smocks of F.11 and F.9 and the Prince's servant's turban&mdash;tore and
  knotted them into a rope and gave the babu one end.</p>

  <p>"You and them others hang on to it and let me down&mdash;not too
  slow&mdash;I'll be done for if a tiger sees me. Maybe I can see when I get
  down there. Stop that fool shooting!"</p>

  <p>But the Prince refilled his magazine and had his own way. Blinding flash
  and echo-cannonading crack continued, even after Hawkes was swinging by a
  string of turbans, turning as the babu lowered him. He was clinging by one
  hand, with his rifle in the other.</p>

  <p>"Can't see a dam' thing!" he called up, when his feet touched bottom.</p>

  <p>Then the babu: "Wait there, Hawkesey. I will bring a lantern."</p>

  <p>F.15 and F.11 laid their weight and strength against the rope and F.9
  hurried to their aid as Chullunder Ghose grabbed at a lantern and swung
  himself over. He went down hand over hand, with his naked toes against the
  masonry, the lantern clattering against the wall. They were both visible,
  like divers under water&mdash;small&mdash;foreshortened. Hawkes's voice:
  "Steady now. I see one."</p>

  <p>His express spat blue-white. Stripes&mdash;fangs&mdash;black-and-yellow
  phantom with a sound like snapped wires&mdash;leaped into the zone of
  lamplight, fell short, clawing at a rotten skeleton, and lay still.</p>

  <p>"Tigress!" said the babu. His voice boomed. He sounded steady, like a big
  gun.</p>

  <p>Hawkes's voice, several notes higher: "Can you see the other?"</p>

  <p>"He is down that tunnel, Hawkesey. I saw his shadow as he stole in."</p>

  <p>Came the sound of an empty brass shell falling and the snap of the closing
  breech as Hawkes reloaded. Then again Hawker's voice:</p>

  <p>"Find the Rajah."</p>

  <p>The pool of lantern-light went sideways, slowly, while the babu hunted
  amid shadows. Then it moved back.</p>

  <p>"I have found him. He is stone-dead. I believe his neck was broken."</p>

  <p>"The Madrasi?"</p>

  <p>"Dead, too."</p>

  <p>"Can you climb back? Blinkin' man-eaters in blinkin' tunnels ain't a
  picnic."</p>

  <p>"I can hear him, Hawkesey. He is clawing at the branches at the far end.
  We could see him against daylight if we should go in after him."</p>

  <p>"You're crazy. If he didn't kill us we'd be shot by that American."</p>

  <p>"If we pursue him with the lantern, Hawkesey, he will break through that
  way. He is thirsty. He has had enough of this place. It is never wise to
  think the enemy is less afraid than you are."</p>

  <p>"Have it your own way. Come on."</p>

  <p>"And I like to let the gods have equal opportunity to swat me like the
  others. We are all flies on a cosmic window-pane."</p>

  <p>They vanished down a dark hole, and a tunnel rumbled to their footsteps,
  until two shots, muffled by a distance, cracked as faintly as whips in a
  blustery wind. Three minutes later, Hawkes's voice, tunnel-hollow:</p>

  <p>"The American got him! He broke through. We're going out at that end. So
  long."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER 25</a><br>
  "Accept my humble praises, sahib"</h2>

  <p class="first">"THAT'S a splendid tiger. Did you get permission?"</p>

  <p>Copeland turned and stared at Major Eustace Smith, wet, bleary-eyed from
  lack of his accustomed sleep, and pompous as an offset to a dirty collar and
  a two-day growth of whiskers.</p>

  <p>"How are the boils?" he answered.</p>

  <p>Before Smith could answer that, Chullunder Ghose, unturbaned, bloody from
  thorn-scratches where he had scrambled out of a hole, abominably filthy and
  so weary that he rolled like a drunkard, came towards him.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, sir," said the babu. "Did you swim the river?"</p>

  <p>"No, I got wet, dammit, hurrying to stop your mischief! What have you been
  up to?"</p>

  <p>"Earning you a ribbon!"</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean, you vulgar fellow?"</p>

  <p>"Listen," said the babu. "I am going over there"&mdash;he
  pointed&mdash;"to appropriate the champagne that his late lamented Highness
  of Kutchdullub does not any longer have an opportunity to drink. I am taking
  with me Hawkesey and Doctor Copeland. Let us hope there is enough champagne
  to make us all drunk. We deserve it. You will get a ribbon, and you don't
  deserve it, but it will look very nice on your dress-suit lapel."</p>

  <p>Hawkes strolled up, wearier, if anything, than the babu.</p>

  <p>"Morning, sir."</p>

  <p>"You are both arrested," said the Major.</p>

  <p>"No, no," said the babu, "you are much too diplomatic. You have saved a
  very nasty situation, I assure you."</p>

  <p>Ram Dass, glancing at the tiger, came and stood as close to Major Smith as
  tact permitted.</p>

  <p>"Had you shot the tiger&mdash;had Hawkes shot it&mdash;had the Rajah shot
  it," said the babu, "diplomatic priests would have immediately stirred a
  revolution in a teacup, and it might have been another Sarajevo&mdash;who
  knows? And if you, or I, or Hawkesey, or the Rajah's cousin, or a common
  murderer had shot the Rajah, there would certainly have been a bad mess. As
  it is, the Rajah took advantage of an opportunity to die in manly battle with
  the poisoner who tried to take his cousin's life; and I have no doubt that
  you recommended to the Rajah he should look into the dirty rumors that were
  flying. It is certain that he acted as a consequence of what you said to him
  in private conversation. He is stone-dead, so he can't deny it. And by giving
  your authority to Doctor Copeland, in a letter that I witnessed, to go
  tiger-shooting, you have cleverly removed a menace from the countryside
  without affording opportunity to priests and such-like people to accuse the
  British of the sacrilege. As an American, does Doctor Copeland give a damn
  for local prejudices? Not he! And what can be done to him? Nothing! He is
  diplomatically no one, and a very useful scapegoat. You invited him to shoot
  the tiger, in my presence! You requested me, in fact, to bring him to relieve
  your boils with just that purpose, and no other, in your mind before you sent
  for him. I know it. I shall say that in my confidential report."</p>

  <p>Smith glanced at Copeland. Copeland grinned and nodded to him.</p>

  <p>"I'm mum."</p>

  <p>"It is true, there were a tiger and a tigress," said the babu. "Both of
  them are dead. The death of one is not accounted for. But I admire immensely
  your particularly brilliant intention to congratulate the Rajah's heir
  immediately and to tell him, if he does not burn this temple, you will take
  steps&mdash;diplomatic steps, as serious as may be. It is nothing less than
  statesmanlike of you to think of telling him that if his elephants should
  draw some fifty or hundred tons of fuel, such a quantity, if burned beneath
  the dangerously-broken roof, would cause it to collapse completely and to
  bury a bone of contention&mdash;many, many bones, I might say! And I think it
  noble of you to insist on Hawkesey's contract being recognized and properly
  extended, at an increase, by the new regime. Accept my humble praises, sahib.
  Now, if you permit me, I will lead away my boon companions and get as drunk
  as quantity permits. I have my leave to go."</p>

  <p>But Ram Dass interrupted him. "About that contract for the
  corn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, to the devil with you!"</p>

  <p>Then the villager came running. "Am I numbered on a pay-roll, sahib? What
  next? Am I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my karma!" said the babu. "C.I.D. is not a bed of roses, is it! Come
  on, Hawkesey&mdash;come on Doctor Copeland&mdash;let us drink annihilation to
  the C.I.D., and politics, and tigers, and to every other dam' thing!"</p>
