<h2><a name="c01" id="c01">A CHANCE MEETING</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It happened at Aix-les-Bains, one of the pleasantest places in
the world. I was staying at the Grand-Hôtel d'Aix, which opens on
the sloping little square with the bronze head of Queen Victoria,
commemorating her visits to that old watering-place in Savoie.
The Casino and the Opera are next door, just across the gardens.
The hotel was built for the travellers of forty years ago, who
liked large rooms and large baths, and quiet. It is not at all
smart, but very comfortable. Long ago I used to hear old
Pittsburghers and Philadelphians talk of it. The newer hotels,
set on the steep hills above the town, have the fashionable
trade; the noise and jazz and dancing.</p>
<p>In the dining-room I often noticed, at a table not far from
mine, an old lady, a Frenchwoman, who usually lunched and dined
alone. She seemed very old indeed, well over eighty, and somewhat
infirm, though not at all withered or shrunken. She was not
stout, but her body had that rather shapeless heaviness which for
some detestable reason often settles upon people in old age. The
thing one especially noticed was her fine head, so well set upon
her shoulders and beautiful in shape, recalling some of the
portrait busts of Roman ladies. Her forehead was low and
straight, her nose made just the right angle with it, and there
was something quite lovely about her temples, something one very
rarely sees.</p>
<p>As I watched her entering and leaving the dining-room I
observed that she was slightly lame, and that she utterly
disregarded it--walked with a quick, short step and great
impatience, holding her shoulders well back. One saw that she was
contemptuously intolerant of the limitations of old age. As she
passed my table she often gave me a keen look and a half-smile
(her eyes were extremely bright and clear), as if she were about
to speak. But I remained blank. I am a poor linguist, and there
would be no point in uttering commonplaces to this old lady; one
knew that much about her, at a glance. If one spoke to her at
all, one must be at ease.</p>
<p>Several times in the early morning I happened to see her leave
the hotel in her motor, and each time her chauffeur brought down
and placed in the car a camp chair, an easel, and canvases and
colour boxes strapped together. Then they drove off toward the
mountains. A plucky old lady, certainly, to go sketching in that
very hot weather--for this was in the latter part of August 1930,
one of the hottest seasons Aix-les-Bains had ever known. Every
evening after dinner the old lady disappeared into the lift and
went to her own rooms. But often she reappeared later, dressed
for the opera, and went out, attended by her maid.</p>
<p>One evening, when there was no opera, I found her smoking a
cigarette in the lounge, where I had gone to write letters. It
was a very hot night, and all the windows were open; seeing her
pull her lace shawl closer about her shoulders, I went to shut
one of them. Then she spoke to me in excellent English:--</p>
<p>"I think that draught blows out from the dining-room. If you
will ask the boy to close the doors, we shall not feel the
air."</p>
<p>I found the boy and had the doors closed. When I returned, the
old lady thanked me, motioned to a chair at her side, and asked
if I had time for a cigarette.</p>
<p>"You are stopping at Aix for some time, I judge?" she asked as
I sat down.</p>
<p>I replied that I was.</p>
<p>"You like it, then? You are taking a cure? You have been here
before?"</p>
<p>No, I was not taking a cure. I had been here before, and had
come back merely because I liked the place.</p>
<p>"It has changed less than most places, I think," she remarked.
"I have been coming here for thirty-five years; I have old
associations with Aix-les-Bains. Besides, I enjoy the music here.
I live in the South, at Antibes. You attend the Grand-Cercle? You
heard the performance of <i>Tristan and Iseult</i> last
night?"</p>
<p>I had not heard it. I told her I had thought the evening too
frightfully hot to sit in a theatre.</p>
<p>"But it was no hotter there than anywhere else. I was not
uncomfortable."</p>
<p>There was a reprimand in her tone, and I added the further
excuse that I had thought the principals would probably not be
very good, and that I liked to hear that opera well sung.</p>
<p>"They were well enough," she declared. "With Wagner I do not
so much care about the voices. It is the orchestra I go to hear.
The conductor last night was Albert Wolff, one of our best
<i>Kapellmeister</i>."</p>
<p>I said I was sorry I had missed the opera.</p>
<p>"Are you going to his classical concert tomorrow afternoon? He
will give a superb rendering of Ravel's <i>La Valse</i>--if you
care for modern music."</p>
<p>I hastily said that I meant to go.</p>
<p>"But have you reserved your places? No? Then I would advise
you to do so at once. The best way here is to have places for the
entire chain of performances. One need not go to all, of course;
but it is the best way. There is little else to do here in the
evening, unless one plays at the gaming tables. Besides, it is
almost September; the days are lowering now, and one needs the
theatre." The old lady stopped, frowned, and made an impatient
gesture with her very interesting hand. "What should I have said
then? Lowering is not the word, but I seldom have opportunity to
speak English."</p>
<p>"You might say the days are growing shorter, but I think
lowering a very good word."</p>
<p><i>"Mais un peu poétique, n'est-ce pas?"</i></p>
<p>"Perhaps; but it is the right kind of poetic."</p>
<p>"And by that you mean?"</p>
<p>"That it's not altogether bookish or literary. The country
people use it in some parts of England, I think. I have heard
old-fashioned farmers use it in America, in the South."</p>
<p>The old lady gave a dry little laugh. "So if the farmers use a
word it is quite safe, eh?"</p>
<p>Yes, I told her, that was exactly what I meant; safe.</p>
<p>We talked a little longer on that first occasion. She asked if
I had been to Chamonix, and strongly advised me to go to a place
near Sallanches, where she had lately been visiting friends, on
her way to Aix-les-Bains. In replying to her questions I fell
into the stupid way one sometimes adopts when speaking to people
of another language; tried to explain something in very simple
words. She frowned and checked me with: "Speak idiomatically,
please. I knew English quite well at one time. If I speak it
badly, it is because now I have no practice."</p>
<p>I said good-night and sat down at a desk to write letters. But
on the way to my room I stopped to tell the friend with whom I
was travelling that the old French lady we had so often admired
spoke very good English, and spoke it easily; that she seemed,
indeed, to have a rather special feeling for language.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The next day was intensely hot. In the morning the beautiful
mountain ridges which surround Aix stood out sharp and clear, but
the vineyards looked wilted. Toward noon the hills grew misty,
and the sun poured down through a slightly milky atmosphere. I
rather dreaded the heat of a concert hall, but at two o'clock I
went to Albert Wolff's concert, and heard such a rendition of
Ravel's <i>La Valse</i> as I do not expect to hear again; a small
orchestra, wonderfully trained, and a masterly conductor.</p>
<p>The program was long, with two intermissions. The last group
did not seem to be especially interesting, and the concert was
quite long enough, and fine enough, without those numbers. I
decided that I could miss them. I would go up to the Square and
have tea beside the Roman arch. As I left the hall by the garden
entrance, I saw the old French lady seated on the veranda with
her maid, wearing a white dress and a white lace garden hat,
fanning herself vigorously, the beads of moisture on her face
making dark streaks in the powder. She beckoned to me and asked
whether I had enjoyed the music. I told her that I had, very much
indeed; but now my capacity for enjoying, or even listening, was
quite spent, and I was going up to the Square for tea.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said she, "that is not necessary. You can have your
tea here at the Maison des Fleurs quite well, and still have time
to go back for the last group."</p>
<p>I thanked her and went across the garden, but I did not mean
to see the concert through. Seeing things through was evidently a
habit with this old lady: witness the way she was seeing life
through, going to concerts and operas in this wilting heat; being
concerned that other people should go, moreover, and caring about
the way in which Ravel was played, when in the course of nature
her interest in new music should have stopped with César Franck,
surely.</p>
<p>I left the Casino gardens through a grotto that gave into the
street, went up to the Square, and had tea with some nice English
people I had met on Mont Revard, a young business man and his
wife come over for their holiday. I felt a little as if I had
escaped from an exacting preceptress. The old lady took it for
granted that one wished to accomplish as much as possible in a
given space of time. I soon found that, to her, life meant just
that--accomplishing things; "doing them always a little better
and better," as she once remarked after I came to know her.</p>
<p>While I was dressing for dinner I decided to go away for a few
days, up into the high mountains of Haute-Savoie, under Mont
Blanc. That evening, when the old lady stopped me to discuss the
concert, I asked her for some suggestions about the hotels there,
since at our first meeting she had said I must certainly go to
some of the mountain places easily reached from Sallanches.</p>
<p>She at once recommended a hotel that was very high and cool,
and then told me of all the excursions I must make from that
place, outlining a full program which I knew I should not follow.
I was going away merely to escape the heat and to regard Mont
Blanc from an advantageous point--not to become acquainted with
the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My trip into the mountains was wholly successful. All the
suggestions the old lady had given me proved excellent, and I
felt very grateful to her. I stayed away longer than I had
intended. I returned to Aix-les-Bains late one night, got up
early the next morning, and went to the bank, feeling that Aix is
always a good place to come back to. When I returned to the hotel
for lunch, there was the old lady, sitting in a chair just
outside the door, looking worn and faded. Why, since she had her
car and her driver there, she had not run away from the heat, I
do not know. But she had stayed through it, and gone out
sketching every morning. She greeted me very cordially, asked
whether I had an engagement for the evening, and suggested that
we should meet in the salon after dinner.</p>
<p>I was dining with my friend, and after dinner we both went
into the writing-room where the old lady was awaiting us. Our
acquaintance seemed to have progressed measurably in my absence,
though neither of us as yet knew the other's name. Her name, I
thought, would mean very little; she was what she was. No one
could fail to recognize her distinction and authority; it was in
the carriage of her head, in her fine hands, in her voice, in
every word she uttered in any language, in her brilliant, very
piercing eyes. I had no curiosity about her name; that would be
an accident and could scarcely matter.</p>
<p>We talked very comfortably for a time. The old lady made some
comment on the Soviet experiment in Russia. My friend remarked
that it was fortunate for the great group of Russian writers that
none of them had lived to see the Revolution; Gogol, Tolstoi,
Turgeniev.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," said the old lady with a sigh, "for Turgeniev,
especially, all this would have been very terrible. I knew him
well at one time."</p>
<p>I looked at her in astonishment. Yes, of course, it was
possible. She was very old. I told her I had never met anyone who
had known Turgeniev.</p>
<p>She smiled. "No? I saw him very often when I was a young girl.
I was much interested in German, in the great works. I was making
a translation of <i>Faust,</i> for my own pleasure, merely, and
Turgeniev used to go over my translation and correct it from time
to time. He was a great friend of my uncle. I was brought up in
my uncle's house." She was becoming excited as she spoke, her
face grew more animated, her voice warmer, something flashed in
her eyes, some strong feeling awoke in her. As she went on, her
voice shook a little. "My mother died at my birth, and I was
brought up in my uncle's house. He was more than father to me. My
uncle also was a man of letters, Gustave Flaubert, you may
perhaps know . . ." She murmured the last phrase in a curious
tone, as if she had said something indiscreet and were evasively
dismissing it.</p>
<p>The meaning of her words came through to me slowly; so this
must be the "Caro" of the <i>Lettres à sa Nièce Caroline.</i>
There was nothing to say, certainly. The room was absolutely
quiet, but there was nothing to say to this disclosure. It was
like being suddenly brought up against a mountain of memories.
One could not see round it; one could only stupidly realize that
in this mountain which the old lady had conjured up by a phrase
and a name or two lay most of one's mental past. Some moments
went by. There was no word with which one could greet such a
revelation. I took one of her lovely hands and kissed it, in
homage to a great period, to the names that made her voice
tremble.</p>
<p>She laughed an embarrassed laugh, and spoke hurriedly. "Oh,
that is not necessary! That is not at all necessary." But the
tone of distrust, the faint challenge in that "you may perhaps
know . . ." had disappeared. <i>"Vous connaissez bien les
&oelig;uvres de mon oncle?"</i></p>
<p>Who did not know them? I asked her.</p>
<p>Again the dry tone, with a shrug. "Oh, I almost never meet
anyone who really knows them. The name, of course, its place in
our literature, but not the works themselves. I never meet anyone
now who cares much about them."</p>
<p>Great names are awkward things in conversation, when one is a
chance acquaintance. One cannot be too free with them; they have
too much value. The right course, I thought, was to volunteer
nothing, above all to ask no questions; to let the old lady say
what she would, ask what she would. She wished, it seemed, to
talk about <i>les &oelig;uvres de mon oncle</i>. Her attack was
uncertain; she touched here and there. It was a large subject.
She told me she had edited the incomplete <i>Bouvard et
Pécuchet</i> after his death, that <i>La Tentation de Saint
Antoine</i> had been his own favourite among his works; she
supposed I would scarcely agree with his choice?</p>
<p>No, I was sorry, but I could not.</p>
<p>"I suppose you care most for <i>Madame Bovary</i>?"</p>
<p>One can hardly discuss that book; it is a fact in history. One
knows it too well to know it well.</p>
<p>"And yet," she murmured, "my uncle got only five hundred
francs for it from the publisher. Of course, he did not write for
money. Still, he would have been pleased . . . Which one, then,
do you prefer?"</p>
<p>I told her that a few years ago I had reread <i>L'Éducation
sentimentale,</i> and felt that I had never risen to its
greatness before.</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Ah, too long, prolix, <i>trop de
conversation</i>. And Frédéric is very weak."</p>
<p>But there was an eagerness in her face, and I knew by
something in her voice that this was like Garibaldi's
proclamation to his soldiers on the retreat from Rome, when he
told them he could offer them cold and hunger and sickness and
misery. He offered something else, too, but the listeners must
know that for themselves.</p>
<p>It had seemed to me when I last read <i>L'Éducation
sentimentale</i> that its very faults were of a noble kind. It is
too cold, certainly, to justify the subtitle, <i>Roman d'un jeune
homme</i>; for youth, even when it has not generous enthusiasm,
has at least fierce egotism. But I had wondered whether this
cool, dispassionate, almost contemptuous presentation of Frédéric
were not a protest against the overly sympathetic manner of
Balzac in his stories of young men: Eugène de Rastignac, Lucien
de Rubempré, Horace Bianchon, and all the others. Certainly
Balzac's habit of playing up his characters, of getting into the
ring and struggling and sweating with them, backing them with all
his animal heat, must have been very distasteful to Flaubert. It
was perhaps this quality of salesmanship in Balzac which made
Flaubert say of him in a letter to this same niece Caroline: "He
is as ignorant as a pot, and bourgeois to the marrow."</p>
<p>Of course, a story of youth, which altogether lacks that
gustatory zest, that exaggerated concern for trivialities, is
scarcely successful. In <i>L'Éducation</i> the trivialities are
there (for life is made up of them), but not the voracious
appetite which drives young people through silly and vulgar
experiences. The story of Frédéric is a story of youth with the
heart of youth left out; and of course it is often dull. But the
latter chapters of the book justify one's journey through it.
Then all the hero's young life becomes more real than it was as
one followed it from year to year, and the story ends on a high
plateau. From that great and quiet last scene, seated by the fire
with the two middle-aged friends (who were never really friends,
but who had been young together), one looks back over Frédéric's
life and finds that one has it all, even the dull stretches. It
is something one has lived through, not a story one has read;
less diverting than a story, perhaps, but more inevitable. One is
"left with it," in the same way that one is left with a weak
heart after certain illnesses. A shadow has come into one's
consciousness that will not go out again.</p>
<p>The old French lady and I talked for some time about
<i>L'Éducation sentimentale</i>. She spoke with warm affection,
with tenderness, of Madame Arnoux.</p>
<p>"Ah yes, Madame Arnoux, she is beautiful!" The moisture in her
bright eyes, the flush on her cheeks, and the general softening
of her face said much more. That charming and good woman of the
middle classes, the wife who holds the story together (as she
held Frédéric himself together), passed through the old lady's
mind so vividly that it was as if she had entered the room.
Madame Arnoux was there with us, in that hotel at Aix, on the
evening of September 5, 1930, a physical presence, in the
charming costume of her time, as on the night when Frédéric first
dined at 24 rue de Choiseul. The niece had a very special feeling
for this one of her uncle's characters. She lingered over the
memory, recalling her as she first appears, sitting on the bench
of a passenger boat on the Seine, in her muslin gown sprigged
with green and her wide straw hat with red ribbons. Whenever the
old lady mentioned Madame Arnoux it was with some mark of
affection; she smiled, or sighed, or shook her head as we do when
we speak of something that is quite unaccountably fine: "Ah yes,
she is lovely, Madame Arnoux! She is very complete."</p>
<p>The old lady told me that she had at home the corrected
manuscript of <i>L'Éducation sentimentale</i>. "Of course I have
many others. But this he gave me long before his death. You shall
see it when you come to my place at Antibes. I call my place the
Villa Tanit, <i>pour la déesse,"</i> she added with a smile.</p>
<p>The name of the goddess took us back to <i>Salammbô</i>, which
is the book of Flaubert I like best. I like him in those great
reconstructions of the remote and cruel past. When I happened to
speak of the splendid final sentence of <i>Hérodias</i>, where
the fall of the syllables is so suggestive of the hurrying
footsteps of John's disciples, carrying away with them their
prophet's severed head, she repeated that sentence softly:
<i>"Comme elle était très lourde, ils la portaient
al-ter-na-tiv-e-ment."</i></p>
<p>The hour grew late. The maid had been standing in the corridor
a long while, waiting for her mistress. At last the old lady rose
and drew her wrap about her.</p>
<p>"Good night, madame. May you have pleasant dreams. As for me,
I shall not sleep; you have recalled too much." She went toward
the lift with the energetic, unconquered step with which she
always crossed the dining-room, carrying with hardihood a body no
longer perfectly under her control.</p>
<p>When I reached my room and opened my windows I, too, felt that
sleep was far from me. The full moon (like the moon in
<i>Salammbô)</i> stood over the little square and flooded the
gardens and quiet streets and the misty mountains with light. The
old lady had brought that great period of French letters very
near; a period which has meant so much in the personal life of
everyone to whom French literature has meant anything at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Probably all those of us who had the good fortune to come upon
the French masters accidentally, and not under the chilling
guidance of an instructor, went through very much the same
experience. We all began, of course, with Balzac. And to young
people, for very good reasons, he seems the final word. They read
and reread him, and live in his world; to inexperience, that
world is neither overpeopled nor overfurnished. When they begin
to read Flaubert--usually <i>Madame Bovary</i> is the
introduction--they resent the change of tone; they miss the glow,
the ardour, the temperament. (It is scarcely exaggeration to say
that if one is not a little mad about Balzac at twenty, one will
never live; and if at forty one can still take Rastignac and
Lucien de Rubempré at Balzac's own estimate, one has lived in
vain.) We first read <i>Bovary</i> with a certain hostility; the
wine is too dry for us. We try, perhaps, another work of
Flaubert, and with a shrug go back to Balzac. But young people
who are at all sensitive to certain qualities in writing will not
find the Balzac they left. Something has happened to them which
dampens their enjoyment. For a time it looks as if they had lost
both Balzac and Flaubert. They recover both, eventually, and read
each for what he is, having learned that an artist's limitations
are quite as important as his powers; that they are a definite
asset, not a deficiency, and that both go to form his flavour,
his personality, the thing by which the ear can immediately
recognize Flaubert, Stendhal, Mérimée, Thomas Hardy, Conrad,
Brahms, César Franck.</p>
<p>The fact remains that Balzac, like Dickens and Scott, has a
strong appeal for the great multitudes of humanity who have no
feeling for any form of art, and who read him only in poor
translations. This is overwhelming evidence of the vital force in
him, which no rough handling can diminish. Also it implies the
lack in him of certain qualities which matter to only a few
people, but matter very much. The time in one's life when one
first began to sense the things which Flaubert stood for, to
admire (almost against one's will) that peculiar integrity of
language and vision, that coldness which, in him, is somehow
noble--that is a pleasant chapter of one's life to remember, and
Madame Franklin Grout had brought it back within arm's length of
me that night.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For that was her name. Next morning the <i>valet de
chambre</i> brought me a visiting card on which was engraved:</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">MADAME FRANKLIN GROUT</p>
<p align="center">ANTIBES</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In one corner <i>Villa Tanit</i> was written in purple
ink.</p>
<p>In the evening we sat in the writing-room again, and Madame
Grout's talk touched upon many things. On the Franco-Prussian
War, for instance, and its effect upon her uncle. He had seen to
it that she herself was comfortably settled in England through
most of that troubled time. And during the late war of 1914 she
had been in Italy a great deal. She loved Italian best of all the
languages she spoke so well. (She spoke Swedish, even; she had
lived for a time in Sweden during the life of her first husband,
who had business interests there.)</p>
<p>She talked of Turgeniev, of her uncle's affection for him and
great admiration for him as an artist.<sup>1</sup> She liked to
recall his pleasant visits to Croisset, which were the reward of
long anticipation on the part of the hosts. Turgeniev usually
fixed the date by letter, changed it by another letter, then
again by telegram--and sometimes he did not come at all.
Flaubert's mother prepared for these visits by inspecting all the
beds in the house, but she never found one long enough to hold
"le Moscove" comfortably.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><sup>1</sup> Madame Grout's regard for Turgeniev
seems to have been warmly returned. In a letter written to her in
1873, immediately after one of Turgeniev's visits to Croisset,
Flaubert says: "Mon Moscove m'a quitté ce matin. . . . Tu l'as
tout à fait séduit, mon loulou! car à plusieurs reprises il m'a
parlé de 'mon adorable nièce,' de 'ma charmante nièce,'
'ravissante femme,' etc., etc. Enfin le Moscove t'adore! ce qui
me fait bien plaisir, car c'est un homme exquis. Tu ne t'imagines
pas ce qu'il sait! Il m'a répété, par c&oelig;ur, des morceaux
des tragédies de Voltaire, et de Luce de Lancival! Il connaît, je
crois, toutes les littératures jusque dans leurs bas-fonds! Et si
modeste avec tout cela! si bonhomme! si
<i>vache</i>!"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Madame Grout seemed to remember with especial pleasure the
evenings when he used to sit at the table with her, going over
her translation of <i>Faust</i>: "That noble man, to give his
time to my childish efforts!" She well remembered the period
during which he was writing <i>Les Eaux printanières,</i> and her
own excitement when she first read that work. Like Henry James,
she seemed to resent Turgeniev's position in the Viardot
household; recalling it, even after such a long stretch of time,
with vexation. "And when they gave a hunt, he looked after the
dogs!" she murmured under her breath. She talked one evening of
his sad latter years: of his disappointment in his daughter, of
his long and painful illness, of the way in which the death of
his friends, going one after another, contracted his life and
made it bleak. But these were very personal memories, and if
Madame Grout had wished to make them public, she would have
written them herself.</p>
<p>Madame Viardot she had known very well, and for many years
after Turgeniev's death. "Pauline Viardot was a superb artist,
very intelligent and engaging as a woman, with a great
charm--and, <i>au fond</i>, very Spanish!" she said. Of Monsieur
Louis Viardot she did not think highly. I gathered that he was
agreeable, but not much more than that. When I asked her whether
Monsieur Viardot had not translated some of Turgeniev's books
into French, the old lady lifted her brows and there was a
mocking glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Turgeniev himself translated them; Viardot may have looked
over his shoulder!"</p>
<p>George Sand she did not like. Yes, she readily admitted, her
men friends were very loyal to her, had a great regard for her;
<i>mon oncle</i> valued her comradeship; but Madame Grout found
the lady's personality distasteful.</p>
<p>I gathered that, for Madame Grout, George Sand did not really
fill any of the great rôles she assigned herself: the devoted
mistress, the staunch comrade and "good fellow," the
self-sacrificing mother. George Sand's men friends believed her
to be all these things; and certainly she herself believed that
she was. But Madame Grout seemed to feel that in these various
relations Madame Dudevant was self-satisfied rather than
self-forgetful; always self-admiring and a trifle unctuous.
Madame Grout's distaste for this baffling kind of falseness was
immediate and instinctive--it put her teeth on edge. Turgeniev,
that penetrating reader of women, seems never to have felt this
shallowness in his friend. But in Chopin's later letters one
finds that he, to his bitter cost, had become aware of
it--curiously enough, through Madame Dudevant's behaviour toward
her own children! It is clear that he had come upon something so
subtly false, so excruciatingly aslant, that when he briefly
refers to it his sentences seem to shudder.</p>
<p>Though I tried to let Madame Grout direct our conversations
without suggestion from me, and never to question her, I did ask
her whether she read Marcel Proust with pleasure.</p>
<p>"<i>Trop dur et trop fatigant,"</i> she murmured, and
dismissed the greatest French writer of his time with a wave of
her hand.</p>
<p>When I made some reference to Anatole France she said quickly:
"Oh, I like him very much! But I like him most where he is most
indebted to my uncle!"</p>
<p>When she was tired, or deeply moved, Madame Grout usually
spoke French; but when she spoke English it was as flexible as it
was correct. She spoke like an Englishwoman, with no French
accent at all.</p>
<p>What astonished me in her was her keen and sympathetic
interest in modern music; in Ravel, Scriabin, Albéniz,
Stravinsky, De Falla. Only a few days before I quitted Aix I
found her at the box office in person, getting exactly the seats
she wanted for a performance of <i>Boris Godounov</i>. She must
change her habitual seat, as she had asked some friends to come
over from Sallanches to hear the opera with her. "You will
certainly hear it? Albert Wolff is conducting for the last time
this season, and he does it very well," she explained.</p>
<p>It was interesting to observe Madame Grout at the opera that
night, to watch the changes that went over her face as she
listened with an attention that never wandered, looking younger
and stronger than she ever did by day, as if the music were some
very potent stimulant. Any form of pleasure, I had noticed, made
her keener, more direct and positive, more authoritative, revived
in her the stamp of a period which had achieved a great style in
art. In a letter which Flaubert wrote her when she was a young
woman, he said:--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"C'est une joie profonde pour moi, mon pauvre loulou,
que de t'avoir donné le goût des occupations intellectuelles. Que
d'ennuis et de sottises il vous épargne!"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Certainly those interests had stood her in good stead, and for
many more years than the uncle himself lived through. She had
still, at eighty-four, a capacity for pleasure such as very few
people in this world ever know at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The next morning I told Madame Grout that, because of the
illness of a friend, I must start at once for Paris.</p>
<p>And when, she asked, could I return and go south to Antibes
and the Villa Tanit, to see her Flaubert collection, and the
interior of his study, which she had brought down there
thirty-five years ago?</p>
<p>I told her I was afraid that visit must be put off until next
summer.</p>
<p>She gave a very charming laugh. "At my age, of course, the
future is somewhat uncertain!" Then she asked whether, on her
return to Antibes, she could send me some souvenir of our
meeting; would I like to have something that had belonged to her
uncle, or some letter written by him?</p>
<p>I told her that I was not a collector; that manuscripts and
autographed letters meant very little to me. The things of her
uncle that were valuable to me I already had, and had had for
years. It rather hurt me that she should think I wanted any
material reminder of her or of Flaubert. It was the Flaubert in
her mind and heart that was to give me a beautiful memory.</p>
<p>On the following day, at <i>déjeuner,</i> I said goodbye to
Madame Grout; I was leaving on the two o'clock train. It was a
hurried and mournful parting, but there was real feeling on both
sides. She had counted upon my staying longer, she said. But she
did not for a moment take on a slightly aggrieved tone, as many
privileged old ladies would have done. There was nothing
"wayward" or self-indulgent about Madame Grout; the whole
discipline of her life had been to the contrary. One had one's
objective, and one went toward it; one had one's duty, and one
did it as best one could.</p>
<p>The last glimpse I had of her was as she stood in the
dining-room, the powder on her face quite destroyed by tears, her
features agitated, but her head erect and her eyes flashing. And
the last words I heard from her expressed a hope that I would
always remember the pleasure we had had together in talking
unreservedly about <i>les &oelig;uvres de mon oncle</i>. Standing
there, she seemed holding to that name as to a staff. A great
memory and a great devotion were the things she lived upon,
certainly; they were her armour against a world concerned with
insignificant matters.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When I got back to Paris and began to re-read the <i>Lettres
de Flaubert à sa Nièce Caroline</i>, I found that the personality
of Madame Grout sent a wonderful glow over the pages. I was now
almost startled (in those letters written her when she was still
a child) by his solicitude about her progress in her English
lessons--those lessons by which I was to profit seventy-three
years afterward!</p>
<p>The five hundred pages of that book were now peopled for me
with familiar figures, like the chronicles of a family I myself
had known. It will always be for me one of the most delightful of
books; and in none of his letters to other correspondents does
Gustave Flaubert himself seem so attractive.</p>
<p>In reading over those letters, covering a stretch of
twenty-four years, with the figure of Madame Grout in one's mind,
one feels a kind of happiness and contentment about the whole
situation--yes, and gratitude to Fate! The great man might have
written very charming and tender and warmly confidential letters
to a niece who was selfish, vain, intelligent merely in a
conventional way--because she was the best he had! One can never
be sure about such things; a heartless and stupid woman may be so
well educated, after all!</p>
<p>But having known Madame Grout, I know that she had the root of
the matter in her; that no one could be more sensitive than she
to all that was finest in Flaubert's work, or more quick to admit
the qualities he did not have--which is quite as important.</p>
<p>During all his best working years he had in his house beside
him, or within convenient distance for correspondence, one of his
own blood, younger and more ardent than he, who absolutely
understood what he was doing; who could feel the great qualities
of his failures, even. Could any situation be happier for a man
of letters? How many writers have found one understanding ear
among their sons or daughters?</p>
<p>Moreover, Caroline was the daughter of a sister whom Flaubert
had devotedly loved. He took her when she was an infant into his
house at Croisset, where he lived alone with his old mother. What
delight for a solitary man of letters and an old lady to have a
baby to take care of, the little daughter of a beloved daughter!
They had all the pleasure of her little girlhood--and she must
have been an irresistible little girl! Flaubert spent a great
deal of time attending to her early education, and when he was
seated at his big writing-table, or working in bed, he liked to
have her in the room, lying on a rug in the corner with her book.
For hours she would not speak, she told me; she was so
passionately proud of the fact that he wanted her to be there.
When she was just beginning to read, she liked to think, as she
lay in her corner, that she was shut in a cage with some powerful
wild animal, a tiger or a lion or a bear, who had devoured his
keeper and would spring upon anyone else who opened his door, but
with whom she was "quite safe and conceited," as she said with a
chuckle.</p>
<p>During his short stays in Paris, Flaubert writes to Caroline
about her favourite rabbit, and the imaginary characters with
whom she had peopled the garden at Croisset. He sends his
greetings to Caroline's doll, Madame Robert:--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Remercie de ma part Mme. Robert qui a bien voulu se
rappeler de moi. Présente-lui mes respects et conseille-lui un
régime fortifiant, car elle me paraît un peu pale, et je ne suis
pas sans inquiétude sur sa santé."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>In a letter from Paris, dated just a year later, when Caroline
was eleven, he tells her that he is sending her Thierry's
<i>Récits des temps mérovingiens</i>, and adds:--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Je suis bien aise que les <i>Récits mérovingiens</i>
t'amusent; relis-les quand tu auras fini; <i>apprends des
dates,</i> tu as tes programmes, et passe tous les jours quelque
temps à regarder une carte de géographie."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>One sees from the letters with what satisfaction Flaubert
followed every step of Caroline's development. Her facility in
languages was a matter of the greatest pride to him, though even
after she is married and living abroad he occasionally finds
fault with her orthography:--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Un peu d'orthographe ne te nuirait pas, mon bibi!
car tu écris <i>aplomb</i> par deux <i>p</i>: 'Moral et physique
sont d'applomb,' trois <i>p</i> marqueraient encore plus
d'énergie! Ça m'a amusé, parce que ça te ressemble."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, it was like her, certainly; like her as she walked across
the floor of that hotel dining-room in Aix-les-Bains, so many
years afterward.</p>
<p>Though she had been married twice, Madame Grout, in our
conversations, did not talk of either of her husbands. Her uncle
had always been the great figure in her life, and even a short
acquaintance with her made me feel that she possessed every
quality for comradeship with him. Besides her devotion to him,
her many gifts, her very unusual intelligence and intuition in
art, she had moral qualities which he must have loved: poise,
great good sense, and a love of fairness and justice. She had the
habit of searching out facts and weighing evidence, for her own
satisfaction. Her speech, when she was explaining something, had
the qualities of good Latin prose: economy, elegance, and
exactness. She was not an idealist; she had lived through two
wars. She was one of the least visionary and sentimental persons
I have ever met. She knew that conditions and circumstances, not
their own wishes, dictate the actions of men. In her mind there
was a kind of large enlightenment, like that of the many-windowed
workroom at Croisset, with the cool, tempered northern light
pouring into it. In her, Flaubert had not only a companion, but a
"daughter of the house" to cherish and protect. And he had her
all his life, until the short seizure which took him off in an
hour. And she, all her life, kept the handkerchief with which
they had wiped the moisture from his brow a few moments before he
died.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I sailed for Quebec in October. In November, while I was at
Jaffrey, New Hampshire, a letter came from Madame Grout; the
envelope had been opened and almost destroyed. I have received
letters from Borneo and Java that looked much less travel-worn.
She had addressed it to me in care of an obscure bookseller, on a
small street in Paris, from whom she had got one of my books. (I
suppose, in her day, all booksellers were publishers.) The letter
had been forwarded through three publishing houses, and a part of
its contents had got lost. In her letter Madame Grout writes that
she is sending me "ci-joint une lettre de mon oncle Gustave
Flaubert adressée à George Sand--elle doit être, je crois, de
1866. Il me semble qu'elle vous fera plaisir et j'ai plaisir à
vous l'envoyer."</p>
<p>This enclosure had been removed. I regretted its loss chiefly
because I feared it would distress Madame Grout. But I wrote her,
quite truthfully, that her wish that I should have one of her
uncle's letters meant a great deal more to me than the actual
possession of it could mean. Nevertheless, it was an awkward
explanation to make, and I delayed writing it until late in
December. I did not hear from her again.</p>
<p>In February my friends in Paris sent me a clipping from the
<i>Journal des Débats</i> which read:--</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">MORT DE MME. FRANKLIN-GROUT</p>
<blockquote>Nous apprenons avec tristesse la mort de Mme.
Franklin-Grout, qui s'est éteinte à Antibes, à la suite d'une
courte maladie.<br>
<br>
Nièce de Gustave Flaubert, Mme. Franklin-Grout a joué un rôle
important dans la diffusion et le succès des &oelig;uvres de son
oncle. Exécutrice testamentaire du grand romancier, qui l'avait
élevée et instruite, Mme. Franklin-Grout a publié la
correspondance de son oncle, si précieuse pour sa psychologie
littéraire, et qui nous a révélé les doctrines de Flaubert et sa
vie de travail acharné. Mme. Franklin-Grout publia aussi
<i>Bouvard et Pécuchet. . . .</i> Mme. Franklin-Grout était une
personne charmante et distinguée, très attachée à ses amis et
qui, jusqu'à la plus extrême vieillesse, avait conservé
l'intelligence et la bonté souriante d'une spirituelle femme du
monde.</blockquote>

<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c02" id="c02">THE NOVEL DÉMEUBLÉ</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The novel, for a long while, has been over-furnished. The
property-man has been so busy on its pages, the importance of
material objects and their vivid presentation have been so
stressed, that we take it for granted whoever can observe, and
can write the English language, can write a novel. Often the
latter qualification is considered unnecessary.</p>
<p>In any discussion of the novel, one must make it clear whether
one is talking about the novel as a form of amusement, or as a
form of art; since they serve very different purposes and in very
different ways. One does not wish the egg one eats for breakfast,
or the morning paper, to be made of the stuff of immortality. The
novel manufactured to entertain great multitudes of people must
be considered exactly like a cheap soap or a cheap perfume, or
cheap furniture. Fine quality is a distinct disadvantage in
articles made for great numbers of people who do not want quality
but quantity, who do not want a thing that "wears," but who want
change,--a succession of new things that are quickly threadbare
and can be lightly thrown away. Does anyone pretend that if the
Woolworth store windows were piled high with Tanagra figurines at
ten cents, they could for a moment compete with Kewpie brides in
the popular esteem? Amusement is one thing; enjoyment of art is
another.</p>
<p>Every writer who is an artist knows that his "power of
observation," and his "power of description," form but a low part
of his equipment. He must have both, to be sure; but he knows
that the most trivial of writers often have a very good
observation. Mérimée said in his remarkable essay on Gogol:
"L'art de choisir parmi les innombrable traits que nous offre la
nature est, après tout, bien plus difficile que celui de les
observer avec attention et de les rendre avec exactitude."</p>
<p>There is a popular superstition that "realism" asserts itself
in the cataloguing of a great number of material objects, in
explaining mechanical processes, the methods of operating
manufactories and trades, and in minutely and unsparingly
describing physical sensations. But is not realism, more than it
is anything else, an attitude of mind on the part of the writer
toward his material, a vague indication of the sympathy and
candour with which he accepts, rather than chooses, his theme? Is
the story of a banker who is unfaithful to his wife and who ruins
himself by speculation in trying to gratify the caprices of his
mistresses, at all reinforced by a masterly exposition of
banking, our whole system of credits, the methods of the Stock
Exchange? Of course, if the story is thin, these things do
reinforce it in a sense,--any amount of red meat thrown into the
scale to make the beam dip. But are the banking system and the
Stock Exchange worth being written about at all? Have such things
any proper place in imaginative art?</p>
<p>The automatic reply to this question is the name of Balzac.
Yes, certainly, Balzac tried out the value of literalness in the
novel, tried it out to the uttermost, as Wagner did the value of
scenic literalness in the music drama. He tried it, too, with the
passion of discovery, with the inflamed zest of an unexampled
curiosity. If the heat of that furnace could not give hardness
and sharpness to material accessories, no other brain will ever
do it. To reproduce on paper the actual city of Paris; the
houses, the upholstery, the food, the wines, the game of
pleasure, the game of business, the game of finance: a stupendous
ambition--but, after all, unworthy of an artist. In exactly so
far as he succeeded in pouring out on his pages that mass of
brick and mortar and furniture and proceedings in bankruptcy, in
exactly so far he defeated his end. The things by which he still
lives, the types of greed and avarice and ambition and vanity and
lost innocence of heart which he created--are as vital today as
they were then. But their material surroundings, upon which he
expended such labour and pains . . . the eye glides over them. We
have had too much of the interior decorator and the "romance of
business" since his day. The city he built on paper is already
crumbling. Stevenson said he wanted to blue-pencil a great deal
of Balzac's "presentation"--and he loved him beyond all modern
novelists. But where is the man who could cut one sentence from
the stories of Mérimée? And who wants any more detail as to how
Carmencita and her fellow factory-girls made cigars? Another sort
of novel? Truly. Isn't it a better sort?</p>
<p>In this discussion another great name naturally occurs.
Tolstoi was almost as great a lover of material things as Balzac,
almost as much interested in the way dishes were cooked, and
people were dressed, and houses were furnished. But there is this
determining difference: the clothes, the dishes, the haunting
interiors of those old Moscow houses, are always so much a part
of the emotions of the people that they are perfectly
synthesized; they seem to exist, not so much in the author's
mind, as in the emotional penumbra of the characters themselves.
When it is fused like this, literalness ceases to be
literalness--it is merely part of the experience.</p>
<p>If the novel is a form of imaginative art, it cannot be at the
same time a vivid and brilliant form of journalism. Out of the
teeming, gleaming stream of the present it must select the
eternal material of art. There are hopeful signs that some of the
younger writers are trying to break away from mere
verisimilitude, and, following the development of modern
painting, to interpret imaginatively the material and social
investiture of their characters; to present their scene by
suggestion rather than by enumeration. The higher processes of
art are all processes of simplification. The novelist must learn
to write, and then he must unlearn it; just as the modern painter
learns to draw, and then learns when utterly to disregard his
accomplishment, when to subordinate it to a higher and truer
effect. In this direction only, it seems to me, can the novel
develop into anything more varied and perfect than all the many
novels that have gone before.</p>
<p>One of the very earliest American romances might well serve as
a suggestion to later writers. In <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> how
truly in the spirit of art is the mise-en-scène presented. That
drudge, the theme-writing high-school student, could scarcely be
sent there for information regarding the manners and dress and
interiors of Puritan society. The material investiture of the
story is presented as if unconsciously; by the reserved,
fastidious hand of an artist, not by the gaudy fingers of a
showman or the mechanical industry of a department-store
window-dresser. As I remember it, in the twilight melancholy of
that book, in its consistent mood, one can scarcely ever see the
actual surroundings of the people; one feels them, rather, in the
dusk.</p>
<p>Whatever is felt upon the page without being specifically
named there--that, one might say, is created. It is the
inexplicable presence of the thing not named, of the overtone
divined by the ear but not heard by it, the verbal mood, the
emotional aura of the fact or the thing or the deed, that gives
high quality to the novel or the drama, as well as to poetry
itself.</p>
<p>Literalness, when applied to the presenting of mental
reactions and of physical sensations, seems to be no more
effective than when it is applied to material things. A novel
crowded with physical sensations is no less a catalogue than one
crowded with furniture. A book like <i>The Rainbow</i> by D. H.
Lawrence sharply reminds one how vast a distance lies between
emotion and mere sensory reactions. Characters can be almost
dehumanized by a laboratory study of the behaviour of their
bodily organs under sensory stimuli--can be reduced, indeed, to
mere animal pulp. Can one imagine anything more terrible than the
story of Romeo and Juliet rewritten in prose by D. H.
Lawrence?</p>
<p>How wonderful it would be if we could throw all the furniture
out of the window; and along with it, all the meaningless
reiterations concerning physical sensations, all the tiresome old
patterns, and leave the room as bare as the stage of a Greek
theatre, or as that house into which the glory of Pentecost
descended; leave the scene bare for the play of emotions, great
and little--for the nursery tale, no less than the tragedy, is
killed by tasteless amplitude. The elder Dumas enunciated a great
principle when he said that to make a drama, a man needed one
passion, and four walls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c03" id="c03">148 CHARLES STREET</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Late in the winter of 1908 Mrs. Louis Brandeis conducted me
along a noisy street in Boston and rang at a door hitherto
unknown to me. Sometimes entering a new door can make a great
change in one's life. That afternoon I had set out from the
Parker House (the old, the real Parker House, before it was
"modernized") to make a call on Mrs. Brandeis. When I reached her
house in Otis Place she told me that we would go farther: she
thought I would enjoy meeting a very charming old lady who was a
near neighbour of hers, the widow of James T. Fields, of the
publishing firm of Ticknor and Fields. The name of that firm
meant something to me. In my father's bookcase there were little
volumes of Longfellow and Hawthorne with that imprint. I wondered
how the widow of one of the partners could still be living. Mrs.
Brandeis explained that when James T. Fields was a man in middle
life, a publisher of international reputation and a widower, he
married Annie Adams, then a girl of nineteen. She had naturally
survived him by many years.</p>
<p>When the door at 148 Charles Street was opened we waited a few
moments in a small reception-room just off the hall, then went up
a steep, thickly carpeted stairway and entered the "long
drawing-room," where Mrs. Fields and Miss Jewett sat at tea. That
room ran the depth of the house, its front windows, heavily
curtained, on Charles Street, its back windows looking down on a
deep garden. Directly above the garden wall lay the Charles River
and, beyond, the Cambridge shore. At five o'clock in the
afternoon the river was silvery from a half-hidden sun; over the
great open space of water the western sky was dove-coloured with
little ripples of rose. The air was full of soft moisture and the
hint of approaching spring. Against this screen of pale winter
light were the two ladies: Mrs. Fields reclining on a green sofa,
directly under the youthful portrait of Charles Dickens (now in
the Boston Art Museum), Miss Jewett seated, the low tea-table
between them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fields wore the widow's lavender which she never
abandoned except for black velvet, with a scarf of Venetian lace
on her hair. She was very slight and fragile in figure, with a
great play of animation in her face and a delicate flush of pink
on her cheeks. Like her friend Mrs. John Gardner, she had a skin
which defied age. As for Miss Jewett--she looked very like the
youthful picture of herself in the game of "Authors" I had played
as a child, except that she was fuller in figure and a little
grey. I do not at all remember what we talked about. Mrs.
Brandeis asked that I be shown some of the treasures of the
house, but I had no eyes for the treasures, I was too intent upon
the ladies.</p>
<p>That winter afternoon began a friendship, impoverished by Miss
Jewett's death sixteen months later, but enduring until Mrs.
Fields herself died, in February 1915.</p>
<p>In 1922 M. A. De Wolfe Howe, Mrs. Fields' literary executor,
published a book of extracts from her diaries under the title
<i>Memories of a Hostess,</i> a book which delighted all who had
known her and many who had not, because of its vivid pictures of
the Cambridge and Concord groups in the '60s and '70s, not as
"celebrities" but as friends and fellow citizens. When Mr. Howe's
book appeared, I wrote for <i>The Literary Review</i> an
appreciation of it, very sketchy, but done with genuine
enthusiasm, which I here incorporate without quotation marks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his book made up from the diaries of Mrs. James T. Fields,
Mr. De Wolfe Howe presents a record of beautiful memories and, as
its subtitle declares, "a chronicle of eminent friendships." For
a period of sixty years Mrs. Fields' Boston house, at 148 Charles
Street, extended its hospitality to the aristocracy of letters
and art. During that long stretch of time there was scarcely an
American of distinction in art or public life who was not a guest
in that house; scarcely a visiting foreigner of renown who did
not pay his tribute there.</p>
<p>It was not only men of letters, Dickens, Thackeray, and
Matthew Arnold, who met Mrs. Fields' friends there; Salvini and
Modjeska and Edwin Booth and Christine Nilsson and Joseph
Jefferson and Ole Bull, Winslow Homer and Sargent, came and went,
against the background of closely united friends who were a part
of the very Charles Street scene. Longfellow, Emerson, Whittier,
Hawthorne, Lowell, Sumner, Norton, Oliver Wendell Holmes--the
list sounds like something in a school-book; but in Mrs. Fields'
house one came to believe that they had been very living
people--to feel that they had not been long absent from the rooms
so full of their thoughts, of their letters, their talk, their
remembrances sent at Christmas to the hostess, or brought to her
from foreign lands. Even in the garden flourished guelder roses
and flowering shrubs which some of these bearers of school-book
names had brought in from Cambridge or Concord and set out there.
At 148 Charles Street an American of the Apache period and
territory could come to inherit a Colonial past.</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Fields was past seventy when I was first
conducted into the long drawing-room, she did not seem old to me.
Frail, diminished in force, yes; but, emphatically, not old. "The
personal beauty of her younger years, long retained, and even at
the end of such a stretch of life not quite lost," to quote Henry
James, may have had something to do with the impression she gave;
but I think it was even more because, as he also said of her,
"all her implications were gay." I had seldom heard so young, so
merry, so musical a laugh; a laugh with countless shades of
relish and appreciation and kindness in it. And, on occasion, a
short laugh from that same fragile source could positively do
police duty! It could put an end to a conversation that had taken
an unfortunate turn, absolutely dismiss and silence impertinence
or presumption. No woman could have been so great a hostess,
could have made so many highly developed personalities happy
under her roof, could have blended so many strongly specialized
and keenly sensitive people in her drawing-room, without having a
great power to control and organize. It was a power so sufficient
that one seldom felt it as one lived in the harmonious atmosphere
it created--an atmosphere in which one seemed absolutely safe
from everything ugly. Nobody can cherish the flower of social
intercourse, can give it sun and sustenance and a tempered clime,
without also being able very completely to dispose of anything
that threatens it--not only the slug, but even the cold draught
that ruffles its petals.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fields was in her own person flower-like; the remarkable
fineness of her skin and pinkness of her cheeks gave one the
comparison--and the natural ruby of her lips she never lost. It
always struck one afresh (along with her clear eyes and their
quick flashes of humour), that large, generous, mobile mouth,
with its rich freshness of colour. "A <i>woman's</i> mouth," I
used to think as I watched her talking to someone who pleased
her; "not an old woman's!" One rejoiced in her little triumphs
over colour-destroying age and its infirmities, as at the play
one rejoices in the escape of the beautiful and frail from the
pursuit of things powerful and evil. It was a drama in which the
heroine must be sacrificed in the end: but for how long did she
make the outward voyage delightful, with how many a
<i>divertissement</i> and bright scene did she illumine the
respite and the long wait at Aulis!</p>
<p>Sixty years of hospitality, so smooth and unruffled for the
recipients, cost the hostess something--cost her a great deal.
The Fieldses were never people of liberal means, and the Charles
Street house was not a convenient house to entertain in. The
basement kitchen was a difficulty. On the first floor were the
reception-room and the dining-room, on the second floor was the
"long drawing-room," running the depth of the house. Mrs. Fields'
own apartments were on the third floor, and the guest-rooms on
the fourth. A house so constructed took a great deal of managing.
Yet there was never an hour in the day when the order and calm of
the drawing-room were not such that one might have sat down to
write a sonnet or a sonata. The sweeping and dusting were done
very early in the morning, the flowers arranged before the guests
were awake.</p>
<p>Besides being distinctly young on the one hand, on the other
Mrs. Fields seemed to me to reach back to Waterloo. As Mr. Howe
reminds us, she had talked to Leigh Hunt about Shelley and his
starlike beauty of face--and it is now more than a century since
Shelley was drowned. She had known Severn well, and it was he who
gave her a lock of Keats' hair, which, under glass with a drawing
of Keats by the same artist, was one of the innumerable treasures
of that house. With so much to tell, Mrs. Fields never became a
set story-teller. She had no favourite stories--there were too
many. Stories were told from time to time, but only as things of
today reminded her of things of yesterday. When we came home from
the opera, she could tell one what Chorley had said on such and
such an occasion. And then if one did not "go at" her, but talked
of Chorley just as if he were Philip Hale or W. J. Henderson, one
might hear a great deal about him.</p>
<p>When one was staying at that house the past lay in wait for
one in all the corners; it exuded from the furniture, from the
pictures, the rare editions, and the cabinets of manuscript--the
beautiful, clear manuscripts of a typewriterless age, which even
the printers had respected and kept clean. The unique charm of
Mrs. Fields' house was not that it was a place where one could
hear about the past, but that it was a place where the past lived
on--where it was protected and cherished, had sanctuary from the
noisy push of the present. In casual conversation, at breakfast
or tea, you might at any time unconsciously press a spring which
liberated recollection, and one of the great shades seemed
quietly to enter the room and to take the chair or the corner he
had preferred in life.</p>
<p>One afternoon I showed her an interesting picture of Pauline
Viardot I had brought from Paris, and my hostess gave me such an
account of hearing Viardot sing Gluck's Orpheus that I felt I had
heard it myself. Then she told me how, when she saw Dickens in
London, just after he had returned from giving a reading in
Paris, he said: "Oh, yes, the house was sold out. But the
important thing is that Viardot came, and sat in a front seat and
never took her glorious eyes off me. So, of course," with a
flourish of his hand, "nothing else mattered!" A little-known
Russian gentleman, Mr. Turgeniev, must have been staying at
Madame Viardot's country house at that time. Did he accompany her
to the reading, one wonders? If he had, it would probably have
meant very little to "Mr. Dickens."</p>
<p>It was at tea-time, I used to think, that the great shades
were most likely to appear; sometimes they seemed to come up the
deeply carpeted stairs, along with living friends. At that hour
the long room was dimly lighted, the fire bright, and through the
wide windows the sunset was flaming, or softly brooding, upon the
Charles River and the Cambridge shore beyond. The ugliness of the
world, all possibility of wrenches and jars and wounding
contacts, seemed securely shut out. It was indeed the peace of
the past, where the tawdry and cheap have been eliminated and the
enduring things have taken their proper, happy places.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fields read aloud beautifully, especially Shakespeare and
Milton, for whom she had, even in age, a wonderful depth of
voice. I loved to hear her read <i>Richard II,</i> or the great,
melancholy speeches of <i>Henry IV</i> in the Palace at
Westminster:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"And changes fill the cup of altera-ti-on<br>
With divers liquors."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of those lines I can only remember with the colour, the
slight unsteadiness, of that fine old voice.</p>
<p>Once I was sitting on the sofa beside her, helping her to hold
a very heavy, very old, calf-bound Milton, while she read:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"In courts and palaces he also reigns,<br>
And in luxurious cities, where the noise<br>
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,<br>
And injury and outrage."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>When she paused in the solemn evocation for breath, I tried to
fill in the interval by saying something about such lines calling
up the tumult of Rome and Babylon.</p>
<p>"Or New York," she said slyly, glancing side-wise, and then at
once again attacked the mighty page.</p>
<p>Naturally, she was rich in reference and quotation. I recall
how she once looked up from a long reverie and said: "You know,
my dear, I think we sometimes forget how much we owe to Dryden's
prefaces." To my shame, I have not to this day discovered the
full extent of my indebtedness. On another occasion Mrs. Fields
murmured something about "<i>A bracelet of bright hair about the
bone.</i>" "That's very nice," said I, "but I don't recognize
it."</p>
<p>"Surely," she said, "that would be Dr. Donne."</p>
<p>I never pretended to Mrs. Fields--I would have had to pretend
too much. "And who," I brazenly asked, "was Dr. Donne?"</p>
<p>I knew before morning. She had a beautiful patience with
B&oelig;otian ignorance, but I was strongly encouraged to take
two fat volumes of Dr. Donne to bed with me that night.</p>
<p>I love to remember one charming visit in her summer house at
Manchester-by-the-Sea, when Sarah Orne Jewett was there. I had
just come from Italy bringing word of the places they most loved
and about which they had often written me, entreating, nay,
commanding me to visit them. Had I gone riding on the Pincian
Hill? Mrs. Fields asked. No, I hadn't; I didn't think many people
rode there now. Well, said Mrs. Fields, the Brownings' little boy
used to ride there, in his velvets. When he complained to her
that the Pincio was the same every day, no variety, she suggested
that he might ride out into the Campagna. But he sighed and shook
his head. "Oh, no! My pony and I have to go there. We are one of
the sights of Rome, you know!" As this was the son of a friend,
one didn't comment upon the child's speech or the future it
suggested.</p>
<p>The second evening after my arrival happened to be a rainy
one--no visitors. After dinner Mrs. Fields began to read a
little--warmed to her work, and read all of Matthew Arnold's
<i>Scholar Gypsy</i> and <i>Tristan and Iseult.</i> Miss Jewett
said she didn't believe the latter poem had been read aloud in
that house since Matthew Arnold himself read it there.</p>
<p>At Manchester, when there were no guests, Mrs. Fields had tea
on the back veranda, overlooking a wild stretch of woodland. Down
in this wood, directly beneath us, were a tea-table and seats
built under the trees, where they used to have tea when the
hostess was younger--now the climb was too steep for her. It was
a little sad, perhaps, to sit and look out over a shrinking
kingdom; but if she felt it, she never showed it. Miss Jewett and
I went down into the wood, and she told me she hated to go there
now, as it reminded her that much was already lost, and what was
left was so at the mercy of chance! It seemed as if a strong wind
might blow away that beloved friend of many years. We talked in
low voices. Who could have believed that Mrs. Fields was to
outlive Miss Jewett, so much the younger, by nearly six years, as
she outlived Mr. Fields by thirty-four! She had the very genius
of survival. She was not, as she once laughingly told me, "to
escape anything, not even free verse or the Cubists!" She was not
in the least dashed by either. Oh, no, she said, the Cubists
weren't any queerer than Manet and the Impressionists were when
they first came to Boston, and people used to run in for tea and
ask her whether she had ever heard of such a thing as "blue
snow," or a man's black hat being purple in the sun!</p>
<p>As in Boston tea was the most happy time for reminiscences, in
Manchester it was at the breakfast hour that they were most
likely to throng. Breakfasts were long, as country breakfasts
have a right to be. We had always been out of doors first and
were very hungry.</p>
<p>One morning when the cantaloupes were particularly fine Mrs.
Fields began to tell me of Henry James' father,--apropos of the
melons, though I forget whether it was that he liked them very
much or couldn't abide them. She told me a great deal about him;
but I was most interested in what she said regarding his faith in
his son. When the young man's first essays and stories began to
come back across the Atlantic from Rome and Paris they did not
meet with approval in Boston; they were thought self-conscious,
artificial, shallow. His father's friends feared the young man
had mistaken his calling. Mr. James the elder, however, was
altogether pleased. He came down to Manchester one summer to have
a talk with the great publisher about Henry, and expressed his
satisfaction and confidence. "Believe me," he said, sitting at
this very table, "the boy will make his mark in letters,
Fields."</p>
<p>The next summer I was visiting Mrs. Fields at Manchester in a
season of intense heat. We were daily expecting the arrival of
Henry James, Jr., himself. One morning came a spluttery letter
from the awaited friend, containing bitter references to the
"Great American summer," and saying that he was "lying at
Nahant," prostrated by the weather. I was very much disappointed,
but Mrs. Fields said wisely: "My dear, it is just as well. Mr.
James is always greatly put about by the heat, and at Nahant
there is the chance of a breeze."</p>
<p>The house at Manchester was called Thunderbolt Hill. Mr. Howe
thinks the name incongruous, but that depends on what
associations you choose to give it. When I went a-calling with
Mrs. Fields and left her card with Thunderbolt Hill engraved in
the corner, I felt that I was paying calls with the lady Juno
herself. Why shouldn't such a name befit a hill of high decisions
and judgments? Moreover, Mrs. Fields was not at all responsible
for that name; it came, as she and Miss Jewett liked proverbs and
place-names to come, from the native folk. Long years before
James T. Fields bought the hill to build a summer cottage, some
fine trees at the top of it had been destroyed by lightning; the
country people thereabouts had ever afterward called it
Thunderbolt Hill.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fields' Journal tells us how in her young married days
she always moved from Boston to Manchester-by-the-Sea in early
summer, just as she still did when I knew her. I remember one
characteristic passage in the Journal, written at Manchester and
dated July 16, 1870:</p>
<p>It is a perfect summer day, she says. Mr. Fields does not go
up to town but stays at home with a bag full of MSS. He and his
wife go to a favourite spot in a pasture by the sea, and she
reads him a new story which has just come in from Henry James,
Jr., then a very young man--<i>Compagnons de Voyage</i>, in
"execrable" handwriting. They find the quality good. "I do not
know," Mrs. Fields wrote in her diary that evening, "why success
in work should affect one so powerfully, but I could have wept as
I finished reading, not from the sweet, low pathos of the tale,
but from the knowledge of the writer's success. It is so
difficult to do anything well in this mysterious world."</p>
<p>Yes, one says to oneself, that is Mrs. Fields, at her best.
She rose to meet a fine performance, always--to the end. At
eighty she could still entertain new people, new ideas, new forms
of art. And she brought to her greeting of the new all the
richness of her rich past: a long, unbroken chain of splendid
contacts, beautiful friendships.</p>
<p>As one follows the diary down through the years, the reader
must feel a certain pride in the determined way in which the New
England group refused to be patronized by glittering foreign
celebrities--by any celebrities! At dinner Dr. Holmes holds
himself a little apart from the actor guests, Jefferson and
Warren, and addresses them as "you gentlemen of the stage" in a
way that quite disturbed Longfellow and, one may judge, the
hostess. They all come to dine with Dickens in his long stays
with the Fieldses, come repeatedly, but they seem ever a little
on their guard. Emerson cannot be got to believe him altogether
genuine and sincere. He insists to Mrs. Fields that Dickens has
"too much talent for his genius," and that he is "too consummate
an artist to have a thread of nature left"! Thackeray made a long
visit at 148 Charles Street. (It is said that he finished
<i>Henry Esmond</i> there.) In the guest-room which he occupied,
with an alcove study, hung a little drawing he had made of
himself, framed with the note he had written the hostess telling
her that, happy as he was here, he must go home to England for
Christmas.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Fields was still a young woman, she noted in her
diary that Aristotle says: "Virtue is concerned with action; art
with production." "The problem in life," she adds, "is to
harmonize these two." In a long life she went far toward working
out this problem. She knew how to appreciate the noble in
behaviour and the noble in art. In the patriot, the
philanthropist, the statesman, she could forgive abominable
taste. In the artist, the true artist, she could forgive vanity,
sensitiveness, selfishness, indecision, and vacillation of will.
She was generous and just in her judgment of men and women
because she understood Aristotle's axiom. "With a great gift," I
once heard her murmur thoughtfully, "we must be willing to bear
greatly, because it has already greatly borne."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, in 1936, a garage stands on the site of 148 Charles
Street. Only in memory exists the long, green-carpeted, softly
lighted drawing-room, and the dining-table where Learning and
Talent met, enjoying good food and good wit and rare vintages,
looking confidently forward to the growth of their country in the
finer amenities of life. Perhaps the garage and all it stands for
represent the only real development, and have altogether taken
the place of things formerly cherished on that spot. If we try to
imagine those dinner-parties which Mrs. Fields describes, the
scene is certainly not to us what it was to her: the lighting has
changed, and the guests seem hundreds of years away from us.
Their portraits no longer hang on the walls of our academies, nor
are their "works" much discussed there. The English classes, we
are told, can be "interested" only in contemporary writers, the
newer the better. A letter from a prep-school boy puts it
tersely: "D. H. Lawrence is rather rated a back-number here, but
Faulkner keeps his end up."</p>
<p>Not the prep-school boys only are blithe to leave the past
untroubled: their instructors pretty generally agree with them.
And the retired professors who taught these instructors do not
see Shelley plain as they once did. The faith of the elders has
been shaken.</p>
<p>Just how did this change come about, one wonders. When and
where were the Arnolds overthrown and the Brownings devaluated?
Was it at the Marne? At Versailles, when a new geography was
being made on paper? Certainly the literary world which emerged
from the war used a new coinage. In England and America the
"masters" of the last century diminished in stature and
pertinence, became remote and shadowy.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Fields never entered this strange twilight. She
rounded out her period, from Dickens and Thackeray and Tennyson,
through Hardy and Meredith to the Great War, with her standards
unshaken. For her there was no revaluation. She died with her
world (the world of "letters" which mattered most to her)
unchallenged. Marcel Proust somewhere said that when he came to
die he would take all his great men with him: since his Beethoven
and his Wagner could never be at all the same to anyone else,
they would go with him like the captives who were slain at the
funeral pyres of Eastern potentates. It was thus Mrs. Fields
died, in that house of memories, with the material keepsakes of
the past about her.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c04" id="c04">MISS JEWETT</a><sup>1</sup></h1>
<p> </p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In reading over a package of letters from Sarah Orne Jewett, I
find this observation: <i>"The thing that teases the mind over
and over for years, and at last gets itself put down lightly on
paper--whether little or great, it belongs to Literature."</i>
Miss Jewett was very conscious of the fact that when a writer
makes anything that belongs to Literature (limiting the term here
to imaginative literature, which she of course meant), his
material goes through a process very different from that by which
he makes merely a good story. No one can define this process
exactly; but certainly persistence, survival, recurrence in the
writer's mind, are highly characteristic of it. The shapes and
scenes that have "teased" the mind for years, when they do at
last get themselves rightly put down, make a much higher order of
writing, and a much more costly, than the most vivid and vigorous
transfer of immediate impressions.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><sup>1</sup> Much of Part I of this sketch was
originally written as a preface to a two-volume collection of
Miss Jewett's stories published by Houghton Mifflin in
1925.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>In some of Miss Jewett's earlier books, <i>Deephaven, Country
Byways, Old Friends</i> and <i>New</i>, one can find first
sketches, first impressions, which later crystallized into almost
flawless examples of literary art. One can, as it were, watch in
process the two kinds of making: the first, which is full of
perception and feeling but rather fluid and formless; the second,
which is tightly built and significant in design. The design is,
indeed, so happy, so right, that it seems inevitable; the design
is the story and the story is the design. The "Pointed Fir"
sketches are living things caught in the open, with light and
freedom and airspaces about them. They melt into the land and the
life of the land until they are not stories at all, but life
itself.</p>
<p>A great many stories were being written upon New England
themes at the same time that Miss Jewett was writing; stories
that to many contemporary readers may have seemed more
interesting than hers, because they dealt with more definite
"situations" and were more heavily accented. But they are not
very interesting to reread today; they have not the one thing
that survives all arresting situations, all good writing and
clever story-making--inherent, individual beauty.</p>
<p>Walter Pater said that every truly great drama must, in the
end, linger in the reader's mind as a sort of ballad. One might
say that every fine story must leave in the mind of the sensitive
reader an intangible residuum of pleasure; a cadence, a quality
of voice that is exclusively the writer's own, individual,
unique. A quality which one can remember without the volume at
hand, can experience over and over again in the mind but can
never absolutely define, as one can experience in memory a
melody, or the summer perfume of a garden. The magnitude of the
subject-matter is not of primary importance, seemingly. An idyll
of Theocritus, concerned with sheep and goats and shade and
pastures, is today as much alive as the most dramatic passages of
the <i>Iliad--</i>stirs the reader's feeling quite as much,
perhaps.</p>
<p>It is a common fallacy that a writer, if he is talented
enough, can achieve this poignant quality by improving upon his
subject-matter, by using his "imagination" upon it and twisting
it to suit his purpose. The truth is that by such a process
(which is not imaginative at all!) he can at best produce only a
brilliant sham, which, like a badly built and pretentious house,
looks poor and shabby after a few years. If he achieves anything
noble, anything enduring, it must be by giving himself absolutely
to his material. And this gift of sympathy is his great gift; is
the fine thing in him that alone can make his work fine.</p>
<p>The artist spends a lifetime in pursuing the things that haunt
him, in having his mind "teased" by them, in trying to get these
conceptions down on paper exactly as they are to him and not in
conventional poses supposed to reveal their character; trying
this method and that, as a painter tries different lightings and
different attitudes with his subject to catch the one that
presents it more suggestively than any other. And at the end of a
lifetime he emerges with much that is more or less happy
experimenting, and comparatively little that is the very flower
of himself and his genius.</p>
<p>The best of Miss Jewett's work, read by a student fifty years
from now, will give him the characteristic flavour, the spirit,
the cadence, of an American writer of the first order,--and of a
New England which will then be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Even in the stories which fall short of being Miss Jewett's
best, one has the pleasure of her society and companionship--if
one likes that sort of companionship. I remember she herself had
a fondness for "The Hiltons' Holiday,"--the slightest of stories:
a hard-worked New England farmer takes his two little girls to
town, some seventeen miles away (a long drive by wagon), for a
treat. That is all, yet the story is a little miracle. It simply
<i>is the look--</i>shy, kind, a little wistful--which shines out
at one from good country faces on remote farms; it is the look
<i>itself</i>. To have got it down upon the printed page is like
bringing the tenderest of early spring flowers from the deep wood
into the hot light of noon without bruising its petals.</p>
<p>To note an artist's limitations is but to define his talent. A
reporter can write equally well about everything that is
presented to his view, but a creative writer can do his best only
with what lies within the range and character of his deepest
sympathies. These stories of Miss Jewett's have much to do with
fisher-folk and seaside villages; with juniper pastures and
lonely farms, neat grey country houses and delightful,
well-seasoned old men and women. That, when one thinks of it in a
flash, is New England. I remember hearing an English actor say
that until he made a motor trip through the New England country
he had supposed that the Americans killed their aged in some
merciful fashion, for he saw none in the cities where he
played.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of people in the State of Maine, and
neighbouring States, who are not found in Miss Jewett's books.
There may be Othellos and Iagos and Don Juans; but they are not
highly characteristic of the country, they do not come up
spontaneously in the juniper pastures as the everlasting does.
Miss Jewett wrote of everyday people who grew out of the soil,
not about exceptional individuals at war with their environment.
This was not a creed with her, but an instinctive preference.</p>
<p>Born within the scent of the sea but not within sight of it,
in a beautiful old house full of strange and lovely things
brought home from all over the globe by seafaring ancestors, she
spent much of her childhood driving about the country with her
doctor father on his professional rounds among the farms. She
early learned to love her country for what it was. What is quite
as important, she saw it as it was. She happened to have the
right nature, the right temperament, to see it so--and to
understand by intuition the deeper meaning of what she saw.</p>
<p>She had not only the eye, she had the ear. From her early
years she must have treasured up those pithy bits of local
speech, of native idiom, which enrich and enliven her pages. The
language her people speak to each other is a native tongue. No
writer can invent it. It is made in the hard school of
experience, in communities where language has been undisturbed
long enough to take on colour and character from the nature and
experiences of the people. The "sayings" of a community, its
proverbs, are its characteristic comment upon life; they imply
its history, suggest its attitude toward the world and its way of
accepting life. Such an idiom makes the finest language any
writer can have; and he can never get it with a notebook. He
himself must be able to think and feel in that speech--it is a
gift from heart to heart.</p>
<p>Much of Miss Jewett's delightful humour comes from her
delicate and tactful handling of this native language of the
waterside and countryside, never overdone, never pushed a shade
too far; from this, and from her own fine attitude toward her
subject-matter. This attitude in itself, though unspoken, is
everywhere felt, and constitutes one of the most potent elements
of grace and charm in her stories. She had with her own stories
and her own characters a very charming relation; spirited, gay,
tactful, noble in its essence and a little arch in its
expression. In this particular relationship many of our most
gifted writers are unfortunate. If a writer's attitude toward his
characters and his scene is as vulgar as a showman's, as
mercenary as an auctioneer's, vulgar and meretricious will his
product for ever remain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>"The distinguished outward stamp"--it was that one felt
immediately upon meeting Miss Jewett: a lady, in the old high
sense. It was in her face and figure, in her carriage, her smile,
her voice, her way of greeting one. There was an ease, a
graciousness, a light touch in conversation, a delicate
unobtrusive wit. You quickly recognized that her gift with the
pen was one of many charming personal attributes. In the short
period when I knew her, 1908 and 1909, she was not writing at
all, and found life full enough without it. Some six years
before, she had been thrown from a carriage on a country road
(sad fate for an enthusiastic horsewoman) and suffered a slight
concussion. She recovered, after a long illness, but she did not
write again--felt that her best working power was spent.</p>
<p>She had never been one of those who "live to write." She lived
for a great many things, and the stories by which we know her
were one of many preoccupations. After the carriage accident she
was not strong enough to go out into the world a great deal;
before that occurred her friendships occupied perhaps the first
place in her life. She had friends among the most interesting and
gifted people of her time, and scores of friends among the
village and country people of her own State--people who knew her
as Doctor Jewett's daughter and regarded "Sarah's writing" as a
ladylike accomplishment. These country friends, she used to say,
were the wisest of all, because they could never be fooled about
fundamentals. Even after her long illness she was at home to a
few visitors almost every afternoon; friends from England and
France were always coming and going. Small dinner-parties and
luncheons were part of the regular routine when she was with Mrs.
Fields on Charles Street or at Manchester-by-the-Sea. When she
was at home, in South Berwick, there were the old friends of her
childhood to whom she must be always accessible. At the time I
knew her she had, as she said, forgone all customary
exercises--except a little gardening in spring and summer. But as
a young woman she devoted her mornings to horseback riding in
fine weather, and was skilful with a sailboat. Every day, in
every season of the year, she enjoyed the beautiful country in
which she had the good fortune to be born. Her love of the Maine
country and seacoast was the supreme happiness of her life. Her
stories were but reflections, quite incidental, of that peculiar
and intensely personal pleasure. Take, for instance, that clear,
daybreak paragraph which begins "By the Morning Boat":</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"On the coast of Maine, where many green islands and
salt inlets fringe the deep-cut shore line; where balsam firs and
bayberry bushes send their fragrance far seaward, and
song-sparrows sing all day, and the tide runs plashing in and out
among the weedy ledges; where cowbells tinkle on the hills and
herons stand in the shady coves--on the lonely coast of Maine
stood a small gray house facing the morning light."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Wherever Miss Jewett might be in the world, in the Alps, the
Pyrenees, the Apennines, she carried the Maine shore-country with
her. She loved it by instinct, and in the light of wide
experience, from near and from afar.</p>
<p>"You must know the world before you can know the village," she
once said to me. Quoted out of its context this remark sounds
like a wise pronouncement, but Miss Jewett never made wise
pronouncements. Her personal opinions she voiced lightly,
half-humorously; any expression of them was spontaneous, the
outgrowth of the immediate conversation. This remark was a
supplementary comment, apropos of a story we had both happened to
read: a story about a mule, introduced by the magazine which
published it with an editorial note to the effect that (besides
being "fresh" and "promising") it was authentic, as the young man
who wrote it was a mule-driver and had never been anything else.
When I asked Miss Jewett if she had seen it, she gave no
affirmative but a soft laugh, rather characteristic of her,
something between amusement and forbearance, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Poor lad! But his mule could have done better! A mule, by
God's grace, is a mule, with the mettle of his kind. Besides, the
mule would be grammatical. It's not in his sure-footed nature to
slight syntax. A horse might tangle himself up in his sentences
or his picket rope, but never a mule."</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Miss Jewett had read too widely, and had too fine a literary
sense, to overestimate her own performance. Every Sunday book
section of the New York dailies announces half a dozen "great"
books, and calls our attention to more great writers than the
Elizabethan age and the nineteenth century put together could
muster. Miss Jewett applied that adjective very seldom (to
Tolstoi, Flaubert, and a few others), certainly never to herself
or to anything of her own. She spoke of "the Pointed Fir papers"
or "the Pointed Fir sketches"; I never heard her call them
stories. She had, as Henry James said of her, "a sort of elegance
of humility, or fine flame of modesty." She was content to be
slight, if she could be true. The closing sentences of "Marsh
Rosemary" might stand as an unconscious piece of
self-criticism,--or perhaps as a gentle apology for the art of
all new countries, which must grow out of a thin soil and bear
its fate:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Who can laugh at my Marsh Rosemary, or who can cry,
for that matter? The gray primness of the plant is made up from a
hundred colors if you look close enough to find them. This Marsh
Rosemary stands in her own place, and holds her dry leaves and
tiny blossoms steadily toward the same sun that the pink lotus
blooms for, and the white rose."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>For contemporary writers of much greater range than her own,
she had the most reverent and rejoicing admiration. She was one
of the first Americans to see the importance of Joseph Conrad.
Indeed, she was reading a new volume of Conrad, late in the
night, when the slight cerebral hæmorrhage occurred from which
she died some months later.</p>
<p>At a time when machine-made historical novels were the
literary fashion in the United States, when the magazines were
full of dreary dialect stories, and the works of John Fox, Jr.,
were considered profound merely because they were very dull and
heavy as clay, Miss Jewett quietly developed her own medium and
confined herself to it. At that time Henry James was the
commanding figure in American letters, and his was surely the
keenest mind any American ever devoted to the art of fiction. But
it was devoted almost exclusively to the study of other and older
societies than ours. He was interested in his countrymen chiefly
as they appeared in relation to the European scene. As an
American writer he seems to claim, and richly to deserve, a sort
of personal exemption. Stephen Crane came upon the scene, a young
man of definite talent, brilliant and brittle,--dealing
altogether with the surfaces of things, but in a manner all his
own. He died young, but he had done something real. One can read
him today. If we glance back over the many novels which have
challenged our attention since Crane's time, it is like taking a
stroll through a World's Fair grounds some years after the show
is over. Palaces with the stucco peeling off, oriental villages
stripped to beaver-board and cement, broken fountains, lakes gone
to mud and weeds. We realize that whatever it is that makes a
book hold together, most of these hadn't it.</p>
<p>Among those glittering novelties which have now become
old-fashioned Miss Jewett's little volumes made a small showing.
A taste for them must always remain a special taste,--but it will
remain. She wrote for a limited audience, and she still has it,
both here and abroad. To enjoy her the reader must have a
sympathetic relation with the subject-matter and a sensitive ear;
especially must he have a sense of "pitch" in writing. He must
recognize when the quality of feeling comes inevitably out of the
theme itself; when the language, the stresses, the very structure
of the sentences are imposed upon the writer by the special mood
of the piece.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand why some of the young students who
have turned back from the present to glance at Miss Jewett find
very little on her pages. Imagine a young man, or woman, born in
New York City, educated at a New York university, violently
inoculated with Freud, hurried into journalism, knowing no more
about New England country people (or country folk anywhere) than
he has caught from motor trips or observed from summer hotels:
what is there for him in <i>The Country of the Pointed
Firs</i>?</p>
<p>This hypothetical young man is perhaps of foreign descent:
German, Jewish, Scandinavian. To him English is merely a means of
making himself understood, of communicating his ideas. He may
write and speak American English correctly, but only as an
American may learn to speak French correctly. It is a surface
speech: he clicks the words out as a bank clerk clicks out silver
when you ask for change. For him the language has no emotional
roots. How could he find the talk of the Maine country people
anything but "dialect"? Moreover, the temper of the people which
lies behind the language is incomprehensible to him. He can see
what these Yankees <i>have not</i> (hence an epidemic of
"suppressed desire" plays and novels), but what they <i>have,</i>
their actual preferences and their fixed scale of values, are
absolutely dark to him. When he tries to put himself in the
Yankee's place, he attempts an impossible substitution.</p>
<p>But the adopted American is not alone in being cut off from an
instinctive understanding of "the old moral harmonies." There is
the new American, whom Mr. Santayana describes as "the untrained,
pushing, cosmopolitan orphan, cocksure in manner but none too
sure in his morality, to whom the old Yankee, with his sour
integrity, is almost a foreigner." <sup>1</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><sup>1</sup> George Santayana: <i>Character and
Opinion in the United States</i>. New York: Charles Scribner's
Sons; 1920.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>When we find ourselves on shipboard, among hundreds of
strangers, we very soon recognize those who are sympathetic to
us. We find our own books in the same way. We like a writer much
as we like individuals; for what he is, simply, underneath his
accomplishments. Oftener than we realize, it is for some moral
quality, some ideal which he himself cherishes, though it may be
little discernible in his behaviour in the world. It is the light
behind his books and is the living quality in his sentences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is this very personal quality of perception, a vivid and
intensely personal experience of life, which make a "style"; Mark
Twain had it, at his best, and Hawthorne. But among fifty
thousand books you will find very few writers who ever achieved a
style at all. The distinctive thing about Miss Jewett is that she
had an individual voice; "a sense for the finest kind of truthful
rendering, the sober, tender note, the temperately touched,
whether in the ironic or pathetic," as Henry James said of her.
During the twenty-odd clamorous years since her death
"masterpieces" have been bumping down upon us like trunks pouring
down the baggage chutes from an overcrowded ocean steamer. But if
you can get out from under them and go to a quiet spot and take
up a volume of Miss Jewett, you will find the voice still there,
with a quality which any ear trained in literature must
recognize.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c05" id="c05">"JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHERS"</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the Prologue of his great work Thomas Mann says of it: "Its
theme is the first and last of all our questioning and speaking
and all our necessity; the nature of man." But it is not the
nature of man as the Behaviourists or the biologists see it. This
is a double nature, struggling with itself, and the struggle is
not to keep the physical machine running smoothly. These ancient
people know very little about their physical structure. Their
attention is fixed upon something within themselves which they
feel to be their real life, consciousness; where it came from and
what becomes of it. In this book men ask themselves the questions
they asked æons ago when they found themselves in an unconscious
world. From the Old Testament, that greatest record of the orphan
soul trying to find its kin somewhere in the universe, and from
the cruder superstitions of the neighbouring Semitic peoples,
Mann has made something like an orchestral arrangement of all the
Semitic religions and philosophies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are two ways in which a story-teller can approach a
theme set in the distant past. The way most familiar to us is
that which Flaubert took in <i>Salammbô.</i> The writer stands in
present time, his own time, and looks backward. He works and
thinks in a long-vanished society. His mind is naturally fixed
upon contrasting that world with our own; upon religions,
institutions, manners, ways of thinking, all very unlike ours.
The reader sees the horrors and splendours of <i>Salammbô</i>
from a distance; partly because it was a point of ethics with
Flaubert to encourage no familiarity at any time, but
particularly because in this book he himself was engaged with the
feeling of distance, strangeness, difference.</p>
<p>Mann approaches an even more distant past by another route; he
gets behind the epoch of his story and looks forward. He begins
with a Prologue which is informed by all the discoveries science
has lately made about the beginnings of human existence on this
globe; the beginnings long before the known beginning, the long
ages when men "did battle with the flying newts" and life was
little more than a misery which persisted. From the depths
without a history he comes up through the ages of orally
transmitted legend; every legend, he believes, having a fact
behind it, an occurrence of critical importance to the breed of
man.</p>
<p>After the tremendous preparation of the Prologue (a marvel of
imaginative power), he rises out of the bottomless depths to the
period of his story; not much more than three thousand years ago,
he says, when men were very much like ourselves, "aside from a
measure of dreamy indefiniteness in their habits of thought."</p>
<p>This same dreamy indefiniteness, belonging to a people without
any of the relentless mechanical gear which directs every moment
of modern life toward accuracy, this indefiniteness is one of the
most effective elements of verity in this great work. We are
among a shepherd people; the story has almost the movement of
grazing sheep. The characters live at that pace. Perhaps no one
who has not lived among sheep can realize the rightness of the
rhythm. A shepherd people is not driving toward anything. With
them, truly, as Michelet said of quite another form of
journeying, the end is nothing, the road is all. In fact, the
road and the end are literally one.</p>
<p>There is nothing in <i>Joseph and His Brothers</i> more
admirable than the tempo, the deliberate, sustained pace. (In
this age of blinding speed and shattering sound!) Never was there
a happier conjunction of writer and subject-matter. Thomas Mann's
natural tempo is deliberate; his sentences come out of
reflection, not out of an impulse. It is possible for him to
write the story of a shepherd people at the right pace and with
the right kind of development,--continual circling and
digression--which here is not digression since it is his purpose.
He can listen to the herdsmen telling their stories over and
over, go backward and forward with their "dreamily indefinite"
habits of thought. He has all the time there is; Mediterranean
time, 1700 B.C.</p>
<p>When I refer to a passage in the book to refresh my memory, I
find myself reading on and on, largely from pleasure in this rich
deliberateness which is never without intensity and deep
vibration. It is not a kind of writing adapted to all subjects,
certainly, but here it is in the very nature of the theme; it
gives, along with this distinctive rhythm, a warm homeliness,
communicates a brooding tenderness which is in the author's mind.
For in this book Herr Mann is enamoured of his theme, wholly
given to it, and this favouritism, held in check by his native
temperateness, is itself a source of pleasure; the strong feeling
under the strong hand.</p>
<p>At the end of his Prologue the author declares that he is glad
to come up from the bottomless pit of prehistoric struggle, and
the undecipherable riddle of the old legends, to something
relatively near, rather like a home-coming. We, too, are glad.
With a sense of escape we approach something already known to us;
not glacier ages or a submerged Atlantis, but the very human
Mediterranean shore, on a moonlight night in the season of
spring.</p>
<p>We have all been there before, even if we have never crossed
salt water. (Perhaps this is not strictly accurate, but even the
Agnostic and the Behaviourist would have to admit that his
great-grandfather had been there.) The Bible countries along the
Mediterranean shore were very familiar to most of us in our
childhood. Whether we were born in New Hampshire or Virginia or
California, Palestine lay behind us. We took it in unconsciously
and unthinkingly perhaps, but we could not escape it. It was all
about us, in the pictures on the walls, in the songs we sang in
Sunday school, in the "opening exercises" at day school, in the
talk of the old people, wherever we lived. And it was in our
language--fixedly, indelibly. The effect of the King James
translation of the Bible upon English prose has been repeated
down through the generations, leaving its mark on the minds of
all children who had any but the most sluggish emotional
nature.</p>
<p>We emerge from Mann's Prologue to find ourselves not only in a
familiar land, but among people we have always known, Joseph and
Jacob: and they are talking about their remote ancestors, whom we
also know. The Book of Genesis lies like a faded tapestry deep in
the consciousness of almost every individual who is more than
forty years of age. Moreover, as it is the background of nearly
all the art of Western Europe, even today's college Senior must
have come upon it, if only by the cheerless road of reference
reading. We are familiar with Mann's characters and their
history, not only through Moses and the Prophets, but through
Milton and Dante and Racine, Bach and Hayden and Handel, through
painters and architects and stone-cutters innumerable. We begin
the book with the great imaginings and the great imaginators
already in our minds--we are dyed through and through with them.
That is the take-off of the story.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The first volume of the work is the book of Jacob,--of Jacob
and his forbears. In a family which held itself so much apart
from other tribes and sects, the connection between each man and
a long line of grandfathers was very close. There were external
features common to all the Semitic religions; hence the shallow
and light-minded of the descendants of Abraham were often
backsliders, marrying with women of other tribes and troubling
themselves very little about the one great idea that had brought
Abraham out of Chaldea and isolated him from his own and all
other peoples. Whenever that conception of God was very strong in
one of Abraham's descendants (was indeed the burning purpose of
his inner life, as it was of Jacob's), that man was virtually
Abraham's grandson, no matter how many physical generations had
gone between, and he was the true and direct inheritor of the
"blessing," aside from any accident of primogeniture.</p>
<p>Throughout this first volume one gradually becomes aware that
Abraham's seed were not so much the "chosen people" as they were
<i>the</i> people <i>who</i> chose. They chose to renounce not
only sacred images, "idols," but all the spells and incantations
and rites to which men resorted for comfort of mind, and to
wander forth searching for a God of whom no image could be made
by mortal hand. A God who was not a form, but a force, an
essence; felt, but not imprisoned in matter. "The God of the
ages," Mann puts it, "for whom he [Abraham] sought a name and
found none sufficient, wherefore he gave Him the plural, calling
Him, provisionally, Elohim, the Godhead."</p>
<p>Herr Mann accounts for Abraham's quest in this wise:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"What had set him in motion was unrest of the spirit,
a need of God, and if--as there can be no doubt--dispensations
were vouchsafed him, they had reference to the irradiations of
his personal experience of God, which was of a new kind
altogether; and his whole concern from the beginning had been to
win for it sympathy and adherence. He suffered; and when he
compared the measure of his inward distress with that of the
great majority, he drew the conclusion that it was pregnant with
the future. Not in vain, so he heard from the newly beheld God,
shall have been thy torment and thine unrest; for it shall
fructify many souls and make proselytes in numbers like to the
sands of the seas; and it shall give impulse to great expansions
of life hidden in it as in a seed; and in one word, thou shalt be
a blessing. A blessing? It is unlikely that the word gives the
true meaning of that which happened to him in his very sight and
which corresponded to his temperament and to his experience of
himself. For the word 'blessing' carries with it an idea which
but ill describes men of his sort: men, that is, of roving spirit
and discomfortable mind, whose novel conception of the deity is
destined to make its mark upon the future. The life of men with
whom new histories begin can seldom or never be a sheer unclouded
blessing; not this it is which their consciousness of self
whispers in their ears. 'And thou shalt be a destiny': such is
the purer and more precise meaning of the promise, in whatever
language it may have been spoken."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea was a leap centuries ahead into the dark. Yet it must
have been born in the mind of one man: such revelations never
come to committees or bureaus of research. Abraham's descendants
could not always live up to it, but tradition held them together,
and the rite of circumcision set them apart. The rite and the
form can be continued even in the sluggish generations when the
significance is lost. But Mann's work begins when the quest which
drove Abraham out of a stupefied materialistic world is burning
bright again in Jacob, who, by stratagems outwardly crooked but
inwardly inevitable, "had saved his life, his precious,
covenanted life, for God and the future." Jacob, apparently, was
the first of Abraham's descendants who had the power of realizing
and experiencing God more and more sharply through all the
variations of a life incredibly eventful and long. He experienced
Him in meditation, in the unforeseeable but strangely logical
working-out of events in his own life--and in dreams. Dreams so
full of meaning that they were to him promises. After Abraham's
people had cut themselves off from the comfortableness and
commonplaceness of anthropomorphic gods, there still remained the
ladder of dreams, by which the orphan soul could mount and the
ministers of grace descend.</p>
<p>Jacob the constant lover, who served seven years for Rachel:
the trickery of Laban: the rivalry between the sisters: these are
great stories which have lived through the centuries. But the
greatest, the most moving story is what the author terms "Jacob's
labouring upon the Godhead." Jacob is a many-sided man,--but the
painting of his contradictions must be left to Thomas Mann
himself. He has done it as no one else could. The creation of
Jacob, in the flesh and in the spirit, is the great achievement
of his work. The man who knows that he bears the "blessing" and
who sees further into destiny than any of his tribe or time,
must, sometimes by purposed indirection, sometimes by stepping
aside and shutting his eyes, "save his precious, covenanted life
for God and the future." For the aim of the law is worth more
than any letter of it, and a trivial transaction or a question of
family government must not be allowed to interfere with those
fruitful seasons of thought which are well called "labour upon
the Godhead."</p>
<p>For every lapse in conduct and shirking of responsibility
Jacob paid, of course. But the payment, however cruel, seems
always to set him a long way forward in his incommunicable
spiritual quest,--which certainly proves that his way was for him
the right way. With every sorrow he brought upon himself for
failing in a plain duty, the immortal jewel he carried within
became brighter, and his faith in the way his fathers had chosen
more sure. His shirking in the matter of restraining Leah's sons
from their revenge for Dinah cost him Rachel, who died because
she was forced to travel by mule-back when she was close upon her
confinement. (Another contributing cause comes in here, very
characteristic of Jacob, and, one might say, of the author's mind
as well.) Rachel died by the roadside, giving birth to Benjamin.
It was as Jacob sat beside her under the mulberry tree, aware
that she was dying, that there came over him the greatest of his
understandings, loftier than all his visions:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"And then it was that he directed upwards into the
silvery light of those worlds above their heads, almost as a
confession that he understood, his question: 'Lord, what dost
Thou?'<br>
<br>
"To such questions there is no answer. Yet it is the glory of the
human spirit that in this silence it does not depart from God,
but rather learns to grasp the majesty of the ungraspable and to
thrive thereon. Beside him the Chaldæan women and slaves chanted
their litanies and invocations, thinking to bind to human wishes
the unreasoning powers. But Jacob had never yet so clearly
understood as in this hour, why all that was false, and why Abram
had left Ur to escape it. The vision vouchsafed him into this
immensity was full of horror but also of power; his labour upon
the godhead, which always betrayed itself in his care-worn mien,
made in this awful night a progress not unconnected with Rachel's
agonies."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Volume two is the Book of Young Joseph, but it is also still
the book of Jacob, though there is a lull in the vicissitudes of
his life. The beauty and promise of Rachel's son fill his
days,--until there occurs the great shock which arouses him again
to the old struggle to comprehend, in some measure, the dealings
of God with man; to justify God, as it were, and find some benign
purpose behind the brutality of accident and mischance.</p>
<p>The character of the relation between father and son we have
known ever since the long conversation between them on that
spring night beside the well. There all Jacob's anxieties were at
once revealed; his fear that the nature of the boy's gifts may
lead him astray to admire the softer graces of other
peoples,--their arts and sciences, which were irrelevant to a
life for the Godhead, and should not concern the boy to whom he
would undoubtedly give the "blessing." In short, the lad was
already worldly, and with scant opportunity had managed to learn
a great deal about other languages and other manners than those
of his shepherd people. In this precocity Jacob sensed a danger.
But he feared other dangers,--love can always see many. He is
troubled to find the boy abroad at night, where a wild beast
might fall upon him; a lion has been seen in the neighbourhood.
And he is always ill at ease when the boy is near a well, a hole
in the earth. Before Joseph's birth his grandfather, Laban, had
consulted a heathen seer who foretold of the child Rachel carried
that he should go down into a pit.</p>
<p>As for Joseph's attitude toward his father, it is what the
good son's always will be. He loves Jacob because it is easy for
him to love, respects him for all he has been and is, and pities
him because his mind is shut against whatever is new and
delightfully strange; against interesting languages and
religions, against the clamour of founded cities and the customs
of foreign peoples. He himself already knows a great deal more
than Jacob, although he admits he is not so wise and has not been
through so much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the second volume opens, Joseph is seventeen. He has
learned many things since that night when he talked with Jacob by
the well, but he is scarcely more mature. To pick up a new
language easily, to astonish his father by his knowledge of
tradition and the spiritual meaning of natural phenomena, to be
the ornament and, indeed, the intellect, of his family; all this
is quite enough to fill the days pleasantly at seventeen.</p>
<p>Very seldom does the personal charm of a character
mysteriously reach out to one from the printed page. All authors
claim it for their favourite creations, but their failure to make
good their claim is so usual that we seldom stop to say to the
writer: "But this is mere writing, I get no feeling of this
person." For me, at least, Herr Mann wholly succeeds in
communicating Joseph's highly individual charm. Mann's own
consciousness of it is very strong, with something paternal in
it, since he so often feels Joseph through Jacob's senses. When,
only a few hours after its birth, Jacob first sees this baby
which had seemed so unwilling to be born at all, when he regards
the unusual shape and firmness of the head and the "strangely
complete little hand," he knows that here is something different
from all the other sturdy little animals which have been born to
him. From that moment the reader also is able to believe in the
special loveliness and equability and fine fibre of this child;
here is no shepherd clod, but something that can take a high
finish.</p>
<p>The misfortune of young Joseph is that he never meets with
anything difficult enough to challenge his very unusual mind.
What there is to be learned from his old teacher, and from the
routine of a shepherds' camp, is mere child's play. Nothing very
interesting ever happens now in Jacob's great family; so Joseph
decorates the trivial events: he exaggerates, gossips, talks too
much, and is extravagantly given to dreams. These are not the
dreams of lassitude, nor are they sensual. They are violent,
dizzy,--nightmares of grandeur. The qualities which are to make
his great future are in him, potential realities, just as they
were in Napoleon at seventeen; and they have nothing to grapple
with.</p>
<p>It was this "something," this innate superiority in the boy
himself, which the brothers hated even more than they hated the
father's favourite: a deeper and more galling kind of jealousy.
The story of Joseph and his brothers is not only forever repeated
in literature, it forever repeats itself in life. The natural
antagonism between the sane and commonplace, and the exceptional
and inventive, is never so bitter as when it occurs in a family:
and Joseph certainly did nothing to conciliate his stolid
brethren. He insisted upon believing (he had to insist, for he
was not vain to the point of stupidity) that all his family
rejoiced in his good looks and brilliancy and general
superiority. Was he not an ornament to them? It did not occur to
him that families which lead self-respecting, simple, industrious
lives are not pleased with or benefited by ornaments of this
kind--which put them in a false position, indeed. The richness of
his own fancy and vitality was quite enough for the youth. Upon
this limitation in Joseph the author comments as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Indifference to the inner life of other human beings,
ignorance of their feelings, display an entirely warped attitude
toward real life, they give rise to a certain blindness. Since
the days of Adam and Eve, since the time when one became two,
nobody has been able to live without wanting to put himself in
his neighbour's place and explore his situation, even while
trying to see it objectively. Imagination, the art of divining
the emotional life of others--in other words, sympathy--is not
only commendable inasmuch as it breaks down the limitations of
the ego; it is always an indispensable means of
self-preservation. But of these rules Joseph knew nothing. His
blissful self-confidence was like that of a spoilt child; it
persuaded him, despite all evidence to the contrary, that
everyone loved him, even more than themselves."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Joseph heeded no preliminary warnings; he was awakened from
his agreeable self-satisfaction only by a shock so terrible that
he barely survived it at all, and this awakening was followed by
a long and hazardous servitude among a hostile people. Life put
him to the test, to many tests, and proved him; he was one of
those whom mischances enlighten and refine. Behind the bright
promise in him there was the sound seed which would grow to its
full measure under any circumstances and could not be
circumvented. The world is always full of brilliant youth which
fades into grey and embittered middle age: the first flowering
takes everything. The great men are those who have developed
slowly, or who have been able to survive the glamour of their
early florescence and to go on learning from life. If we
could</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>       look into the seeds of time,<br>
And say which grain will grow and which will
not,</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>our hopes for young talent would be disappointed less often.
Yet in that very mystery lies much of the fascination which
gifted young people have for their elders. Kindly effort to
shelter them from struggle with the hard facts of existence is
often to take away the bread (or the lack of it) by which they
grow, if the power of growth is in them. Perhaps if young Joseph
had been sent into Egypt on a pension fund or a travelling
scholarship the end might have been very different.</p>
<p>The manner in which he actually sets out for Egypt is a
challenge to fate, certainly: disinherited, bruised in body,
rocking on the camel of Ishmaelite merchants who have bought him
as a slave. Thus he vanishes from the story. We do not know at
what point in his adventures we are first to see him again in
Mann's third volume, but we know that his father is not to see
him again until there has been such a reversal of fortune as
seldom happens--even in old legends, with the direct intervention
of the gods. Though he is brought so low when he leaves us, his
state is not utterly hopeless. The brothers have beaten the
conceit and joy out of him; all his sunny youth he has left
behind him in the pit, and he has come out into the world naked
as when he was born, without father or family or friends, owning
not even his own body. But he is going toward a country where, if
he really possesses the lively intelligence Jacob and old Eliezer
imputed to him, it will find plenty to work upon.</p>
<p>The book ends with Jacob, for however much the story is
Joseph's, it is always Jacob's. He is the compass, the north
star, the seeking mind behind events; he divines their hidden
causes. He knows that even external accidents often have their
roots, their true beginnings, in personal feeling. He accepts the
evidence of the bloody coat and believes that Joseph was devoured
by a boar or a lion, yet his glance at the brothers is always
accusing. But for their hatred, the wild beast might not have
come down upon Joseph.</p>
<p>Jacob is the understanding witness of the whole play, and we
know, when we close the second volume, that he will live to
behold the unimaginable conclusion in Egypt. This is one of the
advantages of making a new story out of an old one which is a
very part of the readers' consciousness. The course of destiny is
already known and fixed for us, it is not some story-teller's
make-believe (though for strangeness no reckless improviser could
surpass this one). What we most love is not bizarre invention,
but to have the old story brought home to us closer than ever
before, enriched by all that the right man could draw from it
and, by sympathetic insight, put into it. Shakespeare knew this
fact very well, and the Greek dramatists long before him.</p>
<p>Herr Mann stresses Joseph's charm of person and address with
good reason. They are stressed even in the highly condensed
account in the Book of Genesis. They are, indeed, the subject of
Joseph's story. Had the Ishmaelites not recognized very
exceptional values in him, they would have sold him in any slave
market. Being sure of special qualities in this piece of
merchandise, they held him for a high purchaser and disposed of
him to the Captain of Pharaoh's guard. He charmed Potiphar and,
to his misfortune, Potiphar's wife. When he was thrown into a
dungeon, his jailor gave him the management of the prison. When
he was brought before Pharaoh, he was given the management of the
kingdom.</p>
<p>He had come into Egypt a slave, born of a half-savage people
whom the cultivated Egyptians despised, and he had been trained
to an occupation they despised. We are told in Genesis that
"every shepherd was an abomination to the Egyptians." (We are not
told why: perhaps because the Egyptian cotton market was already
an important thing in the world?) It is not easy to find a
parallel situation: suppose that a Navajo Indian shepherd boy had
been gathered up by the Spanish explorers and sold to one of the
world-roving merchant ships from Saint-Malo. Suppose, further,
that we find this red Indian boy at the age of thirty become the
virtual ruler of France, a Richelieu or a Mazarin.</p>
<p>How much of his remarkable career Herr Mann will accredit to
Joseph's aptness in worldly affairs (that quality of which old
Jacob was so distrustful), and how much to his direct inheritance
from Jacob, that "blessing" (never formally given) which he
carried with him into a land of subtleties and highly organized
social life, I wait with impatience to learn. I suspect that I
shall still find the father mightier than the son, and more
remarkable as an imaginative creation.</p>
<p>Jacob is the rod of measure. He saw the beginning, the
new-born creature, and believed even then that this was the child
of destiny. He knew Joseph before Joseph knew himself. When the
"true son" disappeared into darkness at the dawn of his promise,
it was Jacob, not Joseph, who bore the full weight of the
catastrophe and tasted the bitterness of death. And he lived to
see the beautiful conclusion; not the worldly triumph only, but
the greatness of heart which could forgive wrongs so shameful and
cruel. Had not Jacob been there to recognize and to foresee, to
be destroyed by grief and raised up again, the story of Joseph
would lose its highest value. Joseph is the brilliant actor in
the scene, but Jacob is the mind which created the piece itself.
His brooding spirit wraps the legend in a loftiness and grandeur
which actual events can never, in themselves, possess. Take Jacob
out of the history of Joseph, and it becomes simply the story of
young genius; its cruel discipline, its ultimate triumph and
worldly success. A story ever new and always gratifying, but one
which never wakens the deep vibrations of the soul.</p>

<h2><a name="c06" id="c06">KATHERINE MANSFIELD</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Late in the autumn of 1920, on my way home from Naples, I had
a glimpse of Katherine Mansfield through the eyes of a fellow
passenger. As I have quite forgotten his real name, I shall call
him Mr. J--. He was a New Englander, about sixty-five years of
age, I conjectured; long, lean, bronzed, clear blue eyes, not
very talkative. His face, however, had a way of talking to
itself. When he sat reading, or merely looking at the water,
changes went over his thin lips and brown cheeks which betokened
silent soliloquy; amusement, doubtful deliberation, very often a
good-humoured kind of scorn, accompanied by an audible sniff
which was not the result of a cold. His profession was the law, I
gathered, though he seemed to know a great deal about mines and
mining engineering. Early American history was his personal
passion, Francis Parkman and Sir George Otto Trevelyan. Though in
both writers he found inconsistencies, he referred to these not
superciliously but rather affectionately.</p>
<p>The voyage was very rough (we were delayed three days by bad
weather), the cabin passengers were few and the wind and cold
kept most of them in their staterooms. I found Mr. J-- good
company. He wore well. Though I have forgotten his name, I have
not forgotten him. He was an original, a queer stick, intelligent
but whimsical and crochety, quickly prejudiced for or against
people by trifling mannerisms. He dined alone at a small table
and always dressed for dinner though no one else did.</p>
<p>He was an agreeable companion chiefly because he was so
unexpected. For example: one morning when he was muttering dry
witticisms about the boat's having lost so much time, he threw
off carelessly that he was trying to get home for his mother's
<i>ninetieth</i> birthday celebration, "though we are not on good
terms, by any means," he chuckled.</p>
<p>I said I had supposed that family differences were outlawed at
ninety.</p>
<p>"Not in our family," he brought out with relish.</p>
<p>He was a true chip, and proud of the old block. He was
bringing a present home to her--a great bundle of leopard skins,
which he showed to me. (He had lately been in Africa.)</p>
<p>He was a bachelor, of course, but when we were filling out
declarations for customs, he had a number of expensive toys to
declare (besides the leopard skins) and sport clothes for young
men. Nephews, I asked? Not altogether, with a twist of the face.
Some of his old friends had done him the compliment of naming
sons after him. Yes, I thought, a bachelor of this kidney was
just the man who would be welcome in other men's homes; he would
be a cheerful interruption in the domestic monotony of correct,
sound people like himself. Possibly he would have friends among
people very unlike himself.</p>
<p>One afternoon as he sat down in his deck chair he picked up a
volume of Synge's plays lying on my rug. He looked at it and
observed:</p>
<p>"Trevelyan is the one English writer I would really like to
meet. The old man."</p>
<p>He glanced through my book for a few moments, then put it back
on my knee and asked abruptly: "What do you think of Katherine
Mansfield?"</p>
<p>I told him I had read her very little (English friends had
sent me over a story of hers from time to time), but I thought
her very talented.</p>
<p>"You think so, do you." It was not a question, but a verdict,
delivered in his driest manner, with a slight sniff. After a
moment he said he had letters to write and went away. Why a
specialist in the American Revolution and the French and Indian
wars should ask me about a girl then scarcely heard of in
America, and why he should be displeased at my answer--</p>
<p>The next morning I saw him doing his usual half-hour on the
deck. "Climbing the deck," he called it, because now, in addition
to the inconveniences of rough weather, we had a very bad list.
Mr. J-- explained that it came about because the coal hadn't been
properly trimmed and had shifted. Very dangerous with a heavy sea
every day . . . disgrace to seamanship . . . couldn't have
happened on a British steamer . . . Italians and French in the
engine room. After climbing and descending the deck until he had
satisfied his conscience, he sat down beside me and flapped his
rug over his knees.</p>
<p>"The young lady we were speaking of yesterday: she writes
under a <i>nom de plume</i>. Her true name is not Mansfield, but
Beauchamp."</p>
<p>"That I didn't know. I know nothing about her, really."</p>
<p>He relapsed into one of his long silences, and I went on
reading.</p>
<p>"May I send the deck steward to my cabin for some sherry,
instead of that logwood he would bring us from the bar?"</p>
<p>The sherry appeared. After we had drunk a few glasses, Mr. J--
began: "The young lady we were speaking of; I happen to have seen
her several times, though I certainly don't move in literary
circles."</p>
<p>I expressed surprise and interest, but he did not go on at
once. He sent the steward for more biscuit, and got up to test
the lashings of his deck chair and mine. We were on the port side
where the wind was milder but the list was worse. At last he made
himself comfortable and began to tell me that he had once gone
out to Australia and New Zealand on business matters. He was very
specific as to dates, geography, boat and railway connections. He
elaborated upon these details. I suppose because they were safe
and sane, things you could check up on, while the real subject of
his communication proved to be very vague. I did not listen
attentively; I had only the dimmest conception of those distant
British colonies. He was telling me about a boat trip he had made
from New Zealand to some Australian port, when gradually his
manner changed; he rambled and was more wary. As he became more
cautious I became more interested. I wish I could repeat his
story exactly as he told it, but his way of talking was peculiar
to himself and I can only give the outline:</p>
<p>Among the people who were coming on board his steamer when he
left New Zealand, Mr. J-- noticed a family party: several
children, a man who was evidently their father, and an old lady
who seemed of quite a different class than the other passengers.
She was quiet, gentle, had the children perfectly under control.
She conducted them below as soon as the boat took off. When they
reappeared on deck they had changed their shore things for play
clothes. Mr. J-- remembered very little about the father, "the
usual pushing colonial type," but he distinctly remembered the
old lady, and a little girl with thin legs and large eyes who
wandered away from the family and apparently wished to explore
the steamer for herself. Presently she came and sat down next Mr.
J--, which pleased him. She was shy, but so happy to be going on
a journey that she answered his questions and talked to him as if
he were not a stranger. She was delighted with everything; the
boat, the water, the weather, the gulls which followed the
steamer. "But have you ever seen them eat?" she asked. "That is
terrible!"</p>
<p>The next morning Mr. J-- was up and out very early; found the
deck washed down and empty. But up in the bow he saw his little
friend of yesterday, doing some sort of gymnastic exercises,
"quick as a bird." He joined her and asked if she had
breakfasted. No, she was waiting for the others.</p>
<p>"Mustn't exercise too much before breakfast," he told her.
"Come and sit down with me." As they walked toward his chair he
noticed that she had put on a fresh dress for the morning. Mr.
J-- said it was "embroidered" (probably cross-stitched) with
yellow ducks, all in a row round the hem. He complimented her
upon the ducks.</p>
<p>"I thought they would astonish you," she said
complacently.</p>
<p>As they sat and talked she kept smoothing her skirt and
settling her sleeves, which had a duck on each cuff. Something
pleased Mr. J-- very much as he recalled the little girl, and her
satisfaction with her fresh dress on that fresh morning aboard a
little coasting steamer. His eyes twinkled and he chuckled. "She
adopted me for the rest of the voyage," he concluded.</p>
<p>No, he couldn't say exactly what the charm of the child was.
She struck him as intensely alert, with a deep curiosity
altogether different from the flighty, excited curiosity usual in
children. She turned things over in her head and asked him
questions which surprised him. She was sometimes with her
grandmother and the other children, but oftener alone, going
about the boat, looking the world over with quiet satisfaction.
When she was with him, he did not talk to her a great deal,
because he liked better to watch her "taking it all in." It was
on her account he had always remembered that short trip, out of
many boat trips. She told him her name, and he easily remembered
it "because of <i>Beauchamp's Career</i>, you see."</p>
<p>"And now do you want chapter two?" Mr. J-- asked me. He
twisted his face and rubbed his chin.</p>
<p>A few years ago he had been in London on a confidential
mission for a client who was also an old friend. The nature of
his business took him more or less among people not of his kind
and not especially to his liking. (He paused here as if taking
counsel with his discretion, and I wondered whether we were to
have another version of Henry James' <i>The Ambassadors.</i>) In
the places frequented by this uncongenial "circle" he heard talk
of a girl from New Zealand who "could knock the standard British
authors into a cocked hat," though she didn't very easily find a
publisher. She scorned conventions, and had got herself talked
about. He heard her name spoken. There could be no doubt; from
the same part of the world, and the name he had never forgotten.
The young lady herself was pointed out to him once in a
restaurant, by the young man whose affairs he had come over to
manage. She was just back from the Continent, and her friends
were giving a dinner for her. As he expected; the same face, the
same eyes. She did not fit the gossip he had been hearing; quite
the contrary. She looked to him almost demure,--except for
something challenging in her eyes, perhaps. And she seemed very
frail. He felt a strong inclination to look her up. He decided to
write to her, but he thought he had better inform himself a
little first. He asked his client whether he had anything Miss
Mansfield had written. The young man, doubtless with humorous
intent, produced a pamphlet which had been privately printed:
<i>Je ne parle pas français.</i> After reading it, Mr. J-- felt
there would be no point in meeting the young writer. He saw her
once afterward, at the theatre. When the play was on and the
lights were down, she looked, he thought, ill and unhappy. He
heartily wished he had never seen or heard of her since that boat
trip.</p>
<p>Mr. J-- turned to me sharply: "<i>Je ne parle pas
français--</i>and what do you think of that story, may I
ask?"</p>
<p>I had not read it.</p>
<p>"Well, I have. I didn't dismiss it lightly; artificial, and
unpleasantly hysterical, full of affectations; she had none as a
child." He spoke rather bitterly: his disappointment was
genuine.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Every writer and critic of discernment who looked into
Katherine Mansfield's first volume of short stories must have
felt that here was a very individual talent. At this particular
time few writers care much about their medium except as a means
for expressing ideas. But in Katherine Mansfield one recognized
virtuosity, a love for the medium she had chosen.</p>
<p>The qualities of a second-rate writer can easily be defined,
but a first-rate writer can only be experienced. It is just the
thing in him which escapes analysis that makes him first-rate.
One can catalogue all the qualities that he shares with other
writers, but the thing that is his very own, his timbre, this
cannot be defined or explained any more than the quality of a
beautiful speaking voice can be.</p>
<p>It was usually Miss Mansfield's way to approach the major
forces of life through comparatively trivial incidents. She chose
a small reflector to throw a luminous streak out into the shadowy
realm of personal relationships. I feel that personal
relationships, especially the uncatalogued ones, the seemingly
unimportant ones, interested her most. To my thinking, she never
measured herself up so fully as in the two remarkable stories
about an English family in New Zealand, "Prelude" and "At the
Bay."</p>
<p>I doubt whether any contemporary writer has made one feel more
keenly the many kinds of personal relations which exist in an
everyday "happy family" who are merely going on living their
daily lives, with no crises or shocks or bewildering
complications to try them. Yet every individual in that household
(even the children) is clinging passionately to his individual
soul, is in terror of losing it in the general family flavour. As
in most families, the mere struggle to have anything of one's
own, to be one's self at all, creates an element of strain which
keeps everybody almost at the breaking-point.</p>
<p>One realizes that even in harmonious families there is this
double life: the group life, which is the one we can observe in
our neighbour's household, and, underneath, another--secret and
passionate and intense--which is the real life that stamps the
faces and gives character to the voices of our friends. Always in
his mind each member of these social units is escaping, running
away, trying to break the net which circumstances and his own
affections have woven about him. One realizes that human
relationships are the tragic necessity of human life; that they
can never be wholly satisfactory, that every ego is half the time
greedily seeking them, and half the time pulling away from them.
In those simple relationships of loving husband and wife,
affectionate sisters, children and grandmother, there are
innumerable shades of sweetness and anguish which make up the
pattern of our lives day by day, though they are not down in the
list of subjects from which the conventional novelist works.</p>
<p>Katherine Mansfield's peculiar gift lay in her interpretation
of these secret accords and antipathies which lie hidden under
our everyday behaviour, and which more than any outward events
make our lives happy or unhappy. Had she lived, her development
would have gone on in this direction more than in any other. When
she touches this New Zealand family and those faraway memories
ever so lightly, as in "The Doll's House," there is a magic one
does not find in the other stories, fine as some of them are.
With this theme the very letters on the page become alive. She
communicates vastly more than she actually writes. One goes back
and runs through the pages to find the text which made one know
certain things about Linda or Burnell or Beryl, and the text is
not there--but something was there, all the same--is there,
though no typesetter will ever set it. It is this overtone, which
is too fine for the printing press and comes through without it,
that makes one know that this writer had something of the gift
which is one of the rarest things in writing, and quite the most
precious. That she had not the happiness of developing her powers
to the full, is sad enough. She wrote the truth from
Fontainebleau a few weeks before she died: "<i>The old mechanism
isn't mine any longer, and I can't control the new.</i>" She had
lived through the first stage, had outgrown her young art, so
that it seemed false to her in comparison with the new light that
was breaking within. The "new mechanism," big enough to convey
the new knowledge, she had not the bodily strength to set in
motion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Katherine Mansfield's published <i>Journal</i> begins in 1914
and ends in 1922, some months before her death. It is the record
of a long struggle with illness, made more cruel by lack of money
and by the physical hardships that war conditions brought about
in England and France. At the age of twenty-two (when most young
people have a secret conviction that they are immortal), she was
already ill in a Bavarian <i>pension.</i> From the time when she
left New Zealand and came back to England to make her own way,
there was never an interval in which she did not have to drive
herself beyond her strength. She never reached the stage when she
could work with a relaxed elbow. In her story "Prelude," when the
family are moving, and the storeman lifts the little girl into
the dray and tucks her up, he says: "Easy does it." She knew
this, long afterward, but she never had a chance to put that
method into practice. In all her earlier stories there is
something fierce about her attack, as if she took up a new tale
in the spirit of overcoming it. "Do or die" is the mood,--indeed,
she must have faced that alternative more than once: a girl come
back to make her living in London, without health or money or
influential friends,--with no assets but talent and pride.</p>
<p>In her volume of stories entitled <i>Bliss,</i> published in
1920 (most of them had been written some years before and had
appeared in periodicals), she throws down her glove, utters her
little challenge in the high language which she knew better than
did most of her readers:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>But I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle,
danger, we pluck this flower, safety.</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>A fine attitude, youthful and fiery: out of all the
difficulties of life and art we will snatch <i>something.</i> No
one was ever less afraid of the nettle; she was defrauded
unfairly of the physical vigour which seems the natural
accompaniment of a high and daring spirit.</p>
<p>At thirteen Katherine Mansfield made the long voyage to
England with her grandmother, to go to school in London. At
eighteen she returned to her own family in Wellington, New
Zealand. It was then the struggle against circumstances began.
She afterward burned all her early diaries, but it is those I
should have liked to read. Exile may be easy to bear for those
who have lived their lives. But at eighteen, after four years of
London, to be thrown back into a prosperous commercial colony at
the end of the world, was starvation. There is no homesickness
and no hunger so unbearable. Many a young artist would sell his
future, all his chances, simply to get back to the world where
other people are doing the only things that, to his inexperience,
seem worth doing at all.</p>
<p>Years afterward, when Katherine Mansfield had begun to do her
best work but was rapidly sinking in vitality, her homesickness
stretched all the other way--backwards, for New Zealand and that
same crude Wellington. Unpromising as it was for her purpose, she
felt that it was the only territory she could claim, in the
deepest sense, as her own. The <i>Journal</i> tells us how often
she went back to it in her sleep. She recounts these dreams at
some length: but the entry which makes one realize that
homesickness most keenly is a short one, made in Cornwall in
1918:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"June 20th,</i> The twentieth of June 1918.<br>
<br>
C'est de la misère.<br>
<br>
Non, pas ça exactement. Il y a quelque chose--une profonde
malaise me suive comme un ombre.<br>
<br>
Oh, why write bad French? Why write at all? 11,500 miles are so
many--too many by 11,499 3/4 for me."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Eleven thousand five hundred miles is the distance from
England to New Zealand.</p>
<p>By this, 1918, she had served her apprenticeship. She had gone
through a succession of enthusiasms for this master and that,
formed friendships with some of the young writers of her own
time. But the person who had freed her from the
self-consciousness and affectations of the experimenting young
writer, and had brought her to her realest self, was not one of
her literary friends but, quite simply, her own brother.</p>
<p>He came over in 1915 to serve as an officer. He was younger
than she, and she had not seen him for six years. After a short
visit with her in London he went to the front, and a few weeks
later was killed in action. But he had brought to his sister the
New Zealand of their childhood, and out of those memories her
best stories were to grow. For the remaining seven years of her
life (she died just under thirty-five) her brother seems to have
been almost constantly in her mind. A great change comes over her
feelings about art; what it is, and why it is. When she prays to
become "humble," it is probably the slightly showy quality in the
early stories that she begs to be delivered from--and forgiven
for. The <i>Journal</i> from 1918 on is a record of a
readjustment to life, a changing sense of its deepest realities.
One of the entries in 1919 recounts a dream in which her brother,
"Chummie," came back to her:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"I hear his hat and stick thrown on to the
hall-table. He runs up the stairs, three at a time. 'Hullo,
darling!' But I can't move--I can't move. He puts his arm round
me, holding me tightly, and we kiss--a long, firm, family kiss.
And the kiss means: We are of the same blood; we have absolute
confidence in each other; we love; all is well; nothing can ever
come between us."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>In the same year she writes:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Now it is May 1919. Six o'clock. I am sitting in my
own room thinking of Mother: I want to cry. But my thoughts are
beautiful and full of gaiety. I think of our house, our garden,
us children--the lawn, the gate, and Mother coming in. 'Children!
Children!' I really only ask for time to write it
all."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>But she did not find too late the things she cared for most.
She could not have written that group of New Zealand stories when
she first came to London. There had to be a long period of
writing for writing's sake. The spontaneous untutored outpouring
of personal feeling does not go very far in art. It is only the
practised hand that can make the natural gesture,--and the
practised hand has often to grope its way. She tells us that she
made four false starts on "At the Bay," and when she finished the
story it took her nearly a month to recover.</p>
<p>The <i>Journal</i>, painful though it is to read, is not the
story of utter defeat. She had not, as she said, the physical
strength to write what she now knew were, to her, the most
important things in life. But she had found them, she possessed
them, her mind fed on them. On them, and on the language of her
greatest poet. (She read Shakespeare continually, when she was
too ill to leave her bed.) The inexhaustible richness of that
language seems to have been like a powerful cordial, warmed her
when bodily nourishment failed her.</p>
<p>Among the stories she left unfinished there is one of singular
beauty, written in the autumn of 1922, a few months before her
death, the last piece of work she did. She called it "Six Years
After": Linda and Burnell grown old, and the boy six years dead.
It has the same powerful slightness which distinguishes the other
New Zealand stories, and an even deeper tenderness.</p>
<p>Of the first of the New Zealand stories, "Prelude," Miss
Mansfield wrote in answer to the inquiries of an intimate
friend:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"This is about as much as I can say about it. You
know, if the truth were known, I have a perfect passion for the
island where I was born. Well, in the early morning there I
always remember feeling that this little island has dipped back
into the dark blue sea during the night only to rise again at
gleam of day, all hung with bright spangles and glittering drops.
(When you ran over the dewy grass you positively felt that your
feet tasted salt.) I tried to catch that moment--with something
of its sparkle and its flavour. And just as on those mornings
white milky mists rise and uncover some beauty, then smother it
again and then again disclose it, I tried to lift that mist from
my people and let them be seen and then to hide them again. . . .
It's so difficult to describe all this and it sounds perhaps
over-ambitious and vain."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>An unpretentious but very suggestive statement of how an
artist sets to work, and of the hazy sort of thing that almost
surely lies behind and directs interesting or beautiful design.
And not with the slighter talents only. Tolstoi himself, one
knows from the different Lives and letters, went to work in very
much the same way. The long novels, as well as the short tales,
grew out of little family dramas, personal intolerances and
predilections,--promptings not apparent to the casual reader and
incomprehensible to the commercial novel-maker.</p>
