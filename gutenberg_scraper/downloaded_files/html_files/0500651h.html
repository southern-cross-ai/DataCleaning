<h2><a name="c01" id="c01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><i>In the telling of a story the narrator takes a bit from
life as definitely and completely as one would cut out a paper
doll, trimming away all of the flimsy sheet excepting the figure.
A section of real life is not so detached and finished, for the
causes and consequences of it reach backward and forward and
across the world. For that reason no mere story can ever be
complete, no family history contain a beginning or an
end.</i></p>
<p><i>This is the story of two midwestern families and the
strange way in which their paths crossed. It begins in Illinois
in the year 1866, and ends in Nebraska in the present one,
severed from all that went before and all that will continue
beyond--a thing of incompleteness.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Matthias Meier was twenty-one in that year of 1866, tall and
stalwart of form, with only a healed red furrow across his upper
left arm to show for the last day's fighting of his Illinois
regiment.</p>
<p>We find him, now, sitting on a high stool before a sloping
desk in the office of his uncle. Office, it may have been called,
but the word was something of a misnomer, for it was no separate
room, merely the end of a dingy salesroom in connection with the
foundry of which his relative was sole owner.</p>
<p>The whole place gave an impression of scowling blackness. Iron
coffee-pots, flat-irons, long-legged frying-pans and
short-handled spiders occupied several shelves; and the larger
utensils, huge kettles and boilers, stood on the floor in
disarray, with plowshares shouldering them, as well as rough kegs
containing nails of various sizes. At the opposite side of the
long room, through an opening, one could see into the blacksmith
shop with its anvil and multitudinous horseshoes hanging about on
spikes as though this were the luckiest place in all Illinois.
Iron was everywhere. Iron was king. One felt there was no other
metal or substance in the world.</p>
<p>Matthias, now, was going over an old ledger in which accounts
had been kept for a dozen years, and not very accurately either,
he was deciding. A master-hand at the molding, his uncle was less
punctilious about records of purchases and sales than his more
mathematical-minded nephew.</p>
<p>Late morning sunshine filtering through a spattered and
cobwebby window fell across the yellow pages of the book.</p>
<p>It was March, and apparently it was going to be an advanced
one. The maples were feeling the push of the sap against the dark
of their bodies. The hickory and oaks of the virgin timber-land
not far away were vaguely responding to the stir of life. In the
pulpiness of the bog the trailing arbutus would soon be showing
its mauve-colored face,--on the hillside a thousand lavender
crocuses spring forth to the call of the sun.</p>
<p>If Matthias Meier, too, vaguely felt the call and the push of
the springtime, he was quite unaware of it, and merely checked
and figured in the thumb-blackened and well-worn pages of the
yellow book.</p>
<p>Up to this time, the room had been quiet save for the bumbling
of a single advance guard of bottle-green flies and the sound of
some one cutting timber far away. But into the stillness now came
the creaking sound of wheels in the yard, the pull of horses'
feet from the stickiness of mud and the lusty "whoa" of an unseen
driver.</p>
<p>Matthias uncoiled his long legs from their crowded posture
under the high table and swung himself off the stool. He even
walked over to the opened door, although it went through his mind
at the time that it was rather an undignified procedure to hurry
out as though customers were so few and far between that they
needed a committee of welcome.</p>
<p>A large and sandy-bearded man was swinging himself over the
lumber-wagon's wheel preparatory to entering. But it was not at
the man Matthias looked. For who, indeed, would look elsewhere
with such a flower-like face before one as that of the girl in
the green silk bonnet? Her full lips were rosy pink, and in their
velvet blueness her wide eyes were like cornflowers. The braid of
her soft hair, wound round her head and showing just at the edge
of the bonnet, was the color of cornsilk before the summer sun
has seared it.</p>
<p>Not that Matthias had time or inclination for any poetic
rhapsodies. He merely took in the composite whole with a sensing
of the girl's dainty perfection, and the fleeting thought that
here was a little Dresden shepherdess.</p>
<p>The girl, in turn, may have been not unpleased at the
appearance of the young foundryman, for Matthias was
strong-featured and very good to look upon. But so intent was he
just now upon the loveliness of the girl that he found himself
staring a little stupidly at the man coming toward him.</p>
<p>"Good-morning to you, sir."</p>
<p><i>"Guten Morgen."</i></p>
<p>When he heard the German tongue, Matthias, too, turned to the
language of his ancestors for, although English schooled, he
could speak it readily. So in the German he asked politely: "What
can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"I'm Wilhelm Stoltz," the man answered much more loudly than
the short distance between the two demanded. "I want to look at
the large kettles."</p>
<p>"Certainly. I'll be glad to show you." Matthias hesitated, and
looked toward the pretty occupant of the wagon sitting rather
like a little queen on her high and homely throne. "Perhaps the
young lady would like to come and see them, too."</p>
<p>She smiled. "I can give help, Father,"--this, too, in the
German tongue,--and began gathering her voluminous skirts in a
little mittened hand.</p>
<p><i>"Nein,"</i> the father said brusquely. "It does not take
two."</p>
<p>Matthias winced at the domineering tone and felt an
embarrassment for the girl who in spite of her youth was
apparently no child. So it was with relief and perhaps something
more which he had not then analyzed that he heard the man call
back over a huge shoulder: "Come, then, if you must." But even
so, the father stomped his way on down a path toward the first of
the pits, leaving the girl to climb over the high wheel as best
she might.</p>
<p>At once Matthias sprang to the wagon and gave her his hand. So
daintily small was she that a heady feeling of the strength of
his masculinity surged over him as he assisted her to alight in a
billowing of skirts.</p>
<p>"It is a nice day," he said a bit inanely in the German.</p>
<p>She nodded gayly: "Meadow larks are singing, and I smell
spring."</p>
<p>Quite true. He noticed it for the first time. Meadow-larks
<i>were</i> singing. You <i>could</i> smell spring.</p>
<p>He walked behind her into the dingy room, noting the pretty
way she carried her shoulders and held her head. A
patrician-looking little thing, not solid and big-boned like so
many of the German girls thereabout.</p>
<p>Inside, the two customers moved among the pots and kettles,
the nails and plowshares, the man stomping about noisily as
though he would tell the business world that no one could pull
wool over his eyes, the girl daintily holding back the dark cloth
of her skirts and the wide fringe of her flowing shawl.</p>
<p>Each time the man asked the prices in the German tongue and
was answered in kind by Matthias, he blustered: "Too much," or
"The price . . . it is crazy," until Matthias heartily disliked
him, so that if it had not been for the girl he would no doubt
have lost a sale by some ill-advised retort.</p>
<p>He could read in the girl's heightened color her
embarrassment, and so did his best to make her feel at ease. Once
while the blustering parent was squeaking in his cowhide boots at
the end of the long room, Matthias pointed out to her a special
kettle. "This one I made myself," he said to her very low.
"Mostly my uncle does the kettle molding."</p>
<p>The kettle was huge and faultless in its rounded symmetry.
Matthias had been painstaking to make the wooden pattern
absolutely right,--the inside mold called the core and the
outside one called the jacket,--had poured molten metal carefully
between them and covered the whole thoroughly with sand to keep
every particle of air from it while it cooled.</p>
<p>"It is perfect." She glanced up shyly.</p>
<p>Vollkommen, was it? Matthias, looking down on her daintiness,
thought she, too, was perfect. "I wish then, that this should be
the one you choose. A perfect kettle for . . ." He wanted to say
"a perfect little lady," but that would have been too bold, so he
finished "for you." But, after all, he knew the words were
synonymous.</p>
<p>She looked up again through long lashes. But this time a
little twinkle invaded the blueness that lay behind them and a
smile just faintly curled at the edge of her lips: "Do not, then,
say to him that this is the one to buy," she suggested
demurely.</p>
<p>And Matthias, sharing her little secret of filial disloyalty,
grinned sympathetically and said: "That I will not."</p>
<p>"How much is this one? . . . and this? . . . and this?"
Wilhelm Stoltz was asking.</p>
<p>And then Matthias Meier did a foolish and unaccountable thing.
He priced the kettle which was of his own molding at a lower
figure than his uncle had put upon it.</p>
<p>Stoltz looked them all over again, craftily, suspiciously,
thumping their sides for the answering sound of the metal, and
then said suddenly and loudly, as though Matthias might discover
his mistake: "This one I take."</p>
<p>Matthias looked quickly at the girl and she gave him the ghost
of a swiftly mischievous and understanding smile, so that he felt
the same headiness of spirit and body which he had experienced
before. For with no words she was saying: "I am glad it is your
kettle." And Matthias was saying: "I made it for you before I had
ever seen you." The messages were as plain as spoken language. No
one knows how it can be transmitted,--this Esperanto of Youth. It
just is so.</p>
<p>Wilhelm Stoltz took out a leather pouch, counted out the money
into the palm of Matthias' hand, lifted the huge iron kettle as
though he must get away with his bargain before any attempt to
rectify a possible mistake had been made, and said loudly: "Come
now, Amalia, we must go." He pronounced it A-moll-ea in the
German way.</p>
<p>Coughing and wheezing and blustering, he stalked ahead of the
two young people out to the wagon. And Matthias, heady and bold,
was saying: "Your name, then, is Amalia?" He, too, pronounced it
Amollea, letting his voice linger over the liquid syllables.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"It's . . . like . . . like a bit of music."</p>
<p>And when she smiled up at that, he asked quickly while there
was time: "Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"Over the Plum Creek road way . . . on the far side of the Big
Woods. But . . ."</p>
<p><i>But what, Amalia? Say it now before you have taken away
with you that which you should not accept. Or have left behind
you that which you should not give.</i></p>
<p>But Amalia did not say it. And when Matthias turned back into
the dullness of the room magic gifts had been exchanged.</p>
<p>And so--such is life--had Wilhelm Stoltz driven up to Peter
McClure's hardware store, or sent to Chicago, or even to
Springfield for an iron kettle, or, for that matter, had Amalia
but finished her sentence, the history of future lives and of a
state might have been different. Some call it Providence, others
Fate. But, Providence or Fate, "life is a loom weaving
illusion."</p>
<p>As it was, Matthias stood looking a little bewildered now at
the remaining kettles and the plowshares and the spiders, as ugly
as ever, but somehow different. How queer that into so gloomy a
place should have come something so shining-winged! He set
himself again to the task of the book-work and, although the same
sand-colored pages of a half-hour before confronted him, they
were now strangely illustrated with shadowy half-pictures of blue
eyes and rosy lips and hair the color of cornsilks before the
summer sun has seared it.</p>
<p>After a time his uncle came in, a quick-moving little man with
a bushy graying beard. "Any one here?"</p>
<p>"The Stoltzes . . . a man and daughter." Matthias realized
that he was making the simple statement with a certain degree of
consciousness.</p>
<p>"Hm! Wilhelm Stoltz, that would be! Up the Plum Creek way . .
. one of the several Lutheran families scattered about."</p>
<p>Even now "up Plum Creek way," Amalia and her father in the
high wagon were lumbering along toward their farm which was the
first one just out of the Big Woods on the timber road.</p>
<p>The journey had taken much of the afternoon, for it lay over
prairie and creek-beds, through muddy roads and timber-land, and
the horses which they drove were heavy brood mares, their legs
large and clumsy and shaggy with hair.</p>
<p>The two said little as they rode. Sometimes the father made a
gruff comment on the stickiness of the mud, the amount of the
last rainfall, or the slowness of the horses. Always it pertained
to the material world and especially that part of it which lay
close at hand. And always when he spoke Amalia agreed with him.
For adverse opinions from his daughter or any other human were
not welcomed. So, riding beside the bulky form of her father,
Amalia lived in her own world, not always the material one and
most definitely not that part of it which was close at hand.</p>
<p>Once she volunteered: "The young man . . . he was
pleasant."</p>
<p>Her father grunted and said gruffly: "You will do well not to
let your thoughts linger on strange young men." Immediately after
which he turned toward her so abruptly that she jumped from the
sheer fright that, having done this very thing, her thoughts were
betraying her.</p>
<p>"You are not doing so?"</p>
<p><i>"Nein,"</i> Amalia said demurely.</p>
<p>But thoughts are acrobats, agile and quite often
untrustworthy. So now, with impish disregard of the command, they
hopped about quite easily. They asked Amalia innocently why the
nice young man wanted to know where she lived. They suggested
with subtle art the possibility that he would try to find out.
And then when the gruff person at her side questioned their
activities they urged her quickly to answer <i>"Nein."</i></p>
<p>It was only in the late afternoon when the heavy horses turned
into the barnyard of the Stoltz farm, that the exigency of a
quick change of dress, the gathering of the eggs, and the
planning of the supper brought all the vagrant thoughts into
subjection and made them subservient to matters more practical,
that Amalia ceased dwelling on the day's experience.</p>
<p>The Stoltz farm-house was modest but as neat and shining as
white paint and green blinds could make it. There were no pigs or
chickens boldly running about as there were at many of the
neighbors'. Pigs were in their pens and chickens in their yards,
both conditions of which were made possible by fences formed of
small hickory posts for the pigs and of tall willow saplings set
close together for the chickens. That the fence of the chicken
yard was now putting forth faint green shoots did not detract
from its utility. On a sloping cellar door, scrubbed like a
bake-board, sat the milk crocks sweetening in the sunshine.
Currant bushes and gooseberry bushes nearby, looking ready to
burst their tightly closed buds, held countless freshly washed
dish-towels. Lilac bushes which were beginning to feel the stir
of sap were near the front door, and a rose vine, brown yet from
the winter's sleep, trailed over the doorway.</p>
<p>Amalia coming into the kitchen door now, sighed that there
were to be changes so soon. Inside the house, thinking of those
changes, she looked about her as with the eye of a stranger. She
saw the shining blackness of the cook-stove (the neighbor Kratzes
still cooked on an open fire), the scrubbed table with its
checkered cloth, the tin brush-and-comb holder on the wall with
the mirror above, the clean wooden pail of water with its gourd
dipper on the shelf, the rag rugs--Oh, it was a pleasant house.
The cellar still held many <i>Schinken</i> from the butchering,
stone jars of <i>Äpfelbutter</i> and <i>Pflaumenbutter.</i> No
old housewife--not even Mrs. Kratz or Mrs. Rhodenbach--had put by
more food last fall than she.</p>
<p>There was soon supper. She and her father and her brother
Fritz, fifteen years old, sat down together to the
<i>Metwurst</i> and the <i>Kartoffel Pfannkuchen.</i> They were
Fritz's favorites,--those pork-sausages and potato-pancakes.</p>
<p>Wilhelm Stoltz spoke very little while attending to the
primary object of eating. When he did it was about the stock, the
shoeing of a horse, and the assignment of Fritz's work for the
morrow. The purchase of the iron kettle, too, came in for some
explanation to Fritz,--the bargain he had made and the fact that
the young man must have made a mistake in the price.</p>
<p>This set all the little acrobatic thoughts somersaulting again
in Amalia's pretty head. And, later, if they mischievously put on
their tumbling act several times during the ensuing week, who was
there to say the performance in that year of 1866 could not be
transmitted through Youth's own particular short waves down
through the damp, dark timber road and across the prairie?</p>
<p>For on Sunday, Matthias Meier, with clean-shaven face and in
his best suit, mounted his uncle's saddle-horse, Trixie, and
turned her head toward Plum Creek and the Big Woods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c02" id="c02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>To Matthias Meier the ride to the Stoltz farm that Sunday was
a long one, but pleasant. The road lay through the straggling
town, over the river bridge under which the dark waters of the
recently melted snows foamed and charged in wrath at the
sturdiness of the timbers, on across the level lands where mud
and matted grasses clutched but could not hold Trixie's flying
hoofs, and then into the darkness of the Big Woods where it wound
sinuously among the maples and oaks and hazelnut underbrush, a
leaf-soaked and twig-covered track just wide enough for a single
wagon, so that one must turn into the spaces between stumps when
meeting another.</p>
<p>As he rode, Matthias tried to analyze what peculiar force in
his nature had summoned him on this unbidden call,--what
emotional upheaval had urged him to plan this trip all week. He
was not accustomed to follow up all his uncle's customers, he
admitted, and grinned to himself at the thought.</p>
<p>For the first half of the trip through river bottoms,
creek-beds, and on open trails, he rode enthusiastically toward
his destination. About the third quarter, on more distant meadow
land, he grew a bit apprehensive over his impulsive journey. In
the last quarter through the Big Woods, his fervor collapsed so
perceptibly that he called himself all kinds of a fool for
coming. But it was noticeable that he held doggedly to his
way.</p>
<p>At a weather-beaten cabin in a clearing he inquired of a young
boy how far it was to the Stoltz farm and was told he was nearly
there, that he would find it lying just beyond the third bend of
the road and that he would know it from the red barn standing
where the timber began to thin for the open land. He thanked the
voluble informer and rode on slowly, entirely apprehensive now
because of the bold thing he was doing.</p>
<p>The woods were thinning,--the maples and the oaks and the
walnuts were not quite so close together,--not quite so thick
now, the bare hazel-brush and the sumac. He rounded a clump of
undergrowth that tangled with a thicket of wild plum trees, and
there in a clearing not twenty feet away was the girl herself.
Evidently she had heard the sound of Trixie's padding hoofs for
she stood facing the trail, her hand at her throat in an attitude
of startled expectancy. To-day she was bareheaded, and the sun
shining into the clearing turned the braided coronet of her light
yellow hair into a pale golden wreath.</p>
<p>She came forward hesitatingly when Matthias slipped off his
horse.</p>
<p><i>"Guten nach Mittag,"</i> she said shyly,--and then by way
of explaining her presence added, as always, in the German: "I
was searching for signs of the first blue-bells."</p>
<p>Bridle-rein over his arm and hat off, Matthias approached and
held out his hand.</p>
<p>Even while she put her own little hard hand into it, she
flushed and said: "You should not be here."</p>
<p>"Why?" Now that he was here and safely over breaking the ice
of the meeting, he felt no fear, but a heady boldness
instead.</p>
<p>She raised her eyes to his slowly, and Matthias' heart beat
quickly at seeing again the deep blueness of them. "Because . . .
I should have told you when you asked where I lived . . . but, of
course, I could not know by the asking you meant to come."</p>
<p><i>Then why were you down in the timber road, watching,
Amalia?</i></p>
<p>Her hand still held in his, Matthias asked: "What is it you
meant to have told me . . . Amalia?"</p>
<p>She dropped her eyes away from Matthias' searching ones.</p>
<p>"That I am betrothed." And with that Amalia had completed the
unfinished sentence.</p>
<p>"You are betrothed?" . . . he repeated slowly. "I . . . I had
not thought of that. I have thought of many things . . . but
never that. All week I thought only of you . . . and that I would
come to-day."</p>
<p>"I, too, shall be truthful now. Something . . . also . . .
some queer thing," she spoke shyly in spite of her honesty, "made
me wonder if you might."</p>
<p>"If you are . . . as you say, betrothed, . . . who . . . who
is he?"</p>
<p>"An old friend of my father's. Oh, not old . . ." she added
apologetically, "at least not as old as my father. He is a good
man. My father and my brother Fritz are very fond of him. My
mother is not living."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry . . . perhaps if your mother . . ."</p>
<p>"I should not be here talking to you," she said, when he
seemed not intending to finish his thought. "I don't know why I
came. It is not right. I have been promised since I was sixteen.
I shall be eighteen soon."</p>
<p>But the hand of Amalia which had been promised for nearly two
years still lay trembling in the hand of Matthias Meier. As
though just now discovering that member's perfidy, she withdrew
it suddenly.</p>
<p>"Where is he now?" Matthias asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Gone with the men to the Nebraska Territory to find suitable
holdings for some of our church people. We are to move as soon as
they return for us. It is said that sometime before many years it
may be a state, too, even as Illinois."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose so." He felt definitely disappointed, vaguely
sad that this lovely girl of whom he had thought all week was
betrothed. A door that had so recently opened a bit seemed
suddenly shut in his face.</p>
<p>"You have come a long way. Perhaps you would like to sit down
awhile . . ." she smiled, "beside your kettle."</p>
<p>And almost for the first time Matthias gave heed to the fact
that the kettle which he had fashioned with such meticulous care
hung on three hickory stakes in the clearing with a mound of
ashes underneath.</p>
<p>"Already you have used it?"</p>
<p>"Yes . . . we made the soap, using all of our grease from the
butchering so we will have a plentiful supply for the long
journey and a whole year after."</p>
<p>But the words recalled this disquieting thing he had heard of
her betrothal and going away, and he frowned as he seated himself
beside her on a log near the kettle.</p>
<p>"But this man . . . you do not love him?" It was as much a
statement as a question. She was a mere child and Matthias felt
very old.</p>
<p>Amalia pondered. "I respect him . . . and my father says that
is the same thing."</p>
<p>"I don't agree with him," Matthias contended boldly, and in
the impulsiveness of youth stood up. "Where is your father? I
would like to see him."</p>
<p>But Amalia, alarmed, was saying: "Do not go to the house to
see him, I beg of you. I am sorry not to be more hospitable. You
saw how domineering he was." <i>Herrscht</i> was the word she
used. "He should not know you are here. He would only anger and
hurt you. Always after Sunday dinner he sleeps. Indeed . . ." and
the gay little smile which had so captivated Matthias was there
again for a flashing moment; "he begins it in the church
service."</p>
<p>Matthias laughed at that and sat down again beside her. "What
causes you to think of going to that troubled territory?"</p>
<p>"It is no longer troubled. The Pawnees have long been quieted,
and my father thinks all is well now to settle there. We are of
the Lutheran faith and here our farms are scattered. My father
says that by moving there and keeping together we can retain our
customs and our language and our church relations."</p>
<p>"But why . . . ?" Matthias wanted to know. "What advantage is
there in the people of one church being so close? I can see how
the Pilgrims of England--persecuted as they were--But you're
not."</p>
<p>"My father says none but the followers of Luther are right,
and it is not well to mingle so much with others. Already two of
the young people have married out of the church."</p>
<p>If Matthias held his own opinion on the iniquitous depths of
that sin, he did not say so. Indeed, when she was speaking so
earnestly he found himself far more interested in watching her
long lashes sweep a soft cheek.</p>
<p>"Our farm is already sold to the English Dunbar family. All
things are as near ready to go as is possible . . . the wagons
are kept always in repair--and the harnesses. Already many
barrels are packed. When the men arrive, all the families need is
a short time for the last of the baking and the loading of the
wagons, and the colony can start. My father says it is like the
German army, each knowing his part and obeying orders
instantly."</p>
<p>For some time sitting there on the sunken log in the clearing
the girl told of the plans for the coming journey. Matthias,
listening and commenting, was disturbed at his own disturbance
over the moving. Once he ventured again: "This man . . . if you
do not love him . . . ?"</p>
<p>She glanced away. "I am promised," she said simply.</p>
<p>Very soon, in spite of nature's heralding of the spring, it
grew too cool, and when the sun dipped behind the top of the
timber, the chilliness of the air made the girl suddenly
shiver.</p>
<p>"You must go in," Matthias was all solicitude, but found
himself hinting broadly: "You do not wish me to go?"</p>
<p><i>"Nein.</i> It would be too hard to explain to my father. He
could not understand that you were--" she put out her hand, "a
new friend."</p>
<p>At that, Matthias forgot the coming journey and the faith of
Martin Luther, the domineering father and the affianced who was
far off beyond the Big Muddy.</p>
<p>"Meet me here again next Sunday afternoon, Amalia. You'll
come? It couldn't be otherwise."</p>
<p>When she hesitated, he said, to test her: "Or I shall come
boldly to the house to call on my new friend."</p>
<p>"I'll come," she turned away, anxious and hurried now that she
had been here such a long time. "But it will be wrong," she
called over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"And beautiful," Matthias grinned back at her impudently so
that she, too, was smiling a bit mischievously when she went
away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c03" id="c03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>All week Amalia went about her housework. She cooked and
cleaned and scrubbed in her energetic and immaculate way.
Everything was as it had been,--save one. And all week Matthias
sold his uncle's iron wares, kept the books, and occasionally
shod a horse at the blacksmith end of the shop. And everything
was as it had been,--save one.</p>
<p>Sunday was milder. The Big Woods gave forth the pungent odor
of bursting buds and warming leaf-mold. At the creek-bed fuzzy
pussies scratched insistently inside the branches of the willows.
Wild gray geese flew honking across the timber-land and
disappeared in the distant north. Swallows darted high in their
nuptial flight and a meadow-lark sat on a stake-and-rider fence
and sang the prairie's love song to the spring.</p>
<p>Amalia had been in the clearing only a short time when
Matthias came riding through the damp dark timber road and into
the open. At the sight of the gallant figure that had scarce been
out of her mind all week, she stopped, frightened at the import
of the moment, her hand at her throat as though she must stifle
the call of her heart to him.</p>
<p>With no word Matthias dismounted, threw Trixie's bridle-reins
over a scrub oak and with open arms walked toward the girl.</p>
<p>With no word Amalia, trembling, waited for him to come. It was
not until his arms closed around her and he had kissed her--and
even for a long moment afterward--that a word was spoken.</p>
<p>"I have thought of you every moment." His voice shook with
emotion.</p>
<p>"And I of you."</p>
<p>"You must break your betrothal, Amalia."</p>
<p>"At this moment it is broken, Matthias."</p>
<p>"This . . ." said Matthias after a time, "is what love
is."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Amalia, "I know now. All week I have known."</p>
<p>"And when the homesteaders go you will stay with me? My uncle
is old. In time I shall be able to buy the foundry from him. It
is not my choice of businesses. I have been restless in it, but
with you to be there with me, I shall settle down and like it
better."</p>
<p>"I will stay, Matthias. I fear for the trouble it will make,
but I will stay."</p>
<p>"And you do not think it wicked, then, to marry outside the
church?" he teased her. "Do I seem now such a heathen . . . such
a monster?" But when he saw how troubled it made her, he drew her
to him again with comforting words, calling her his <i>kleine
Taube,</i>--"little dove" in the English.</p>
<p>The afternoon slipped away as they talked of this new-old
thing that had come to them.</p>
<p>"Spring! It seems that this spring belongs just to us, and to
no other," Amalia said once.</p>
<p>"But they will keep coming, little dove. Think of it. They
will <i>all</i> be ours. All our lives we'll live them over and
over together . . . this same feel in the air . . . the odors of
the woods . . . the wild geese honking . . ."</p>
<p>"Even when we grow very old . . ."</p>
<p>Matthias laughed at that. How could youth grow old? "I shall
hold you close then, just as I do now, and say: 'It's spring
again, Amalia! They keep coming.'"</p>
<p>"And I shall say: 'They will go on . . . forever . . . even
though we grow old . . . and after.'"</p>
<p>But there were other things besides these sentimental
generalities to discuss, so that they must put an end to their
first rapturous moments, sit down on the log and speak of the
seriousness of the future. Matthias would have gone immediately
to the house but Amalia would not hear of it. "Not to-day--" she
begged him. "It is so beautiful. For when that time comes, we
shall have anger and harsh words. No, Matthias, give me my
perfect day."</p>
<p>And because she would have it so, he did not go in to confront
her father, but left her there in the clearing until he should
come again.</p>
<p>On the next Sunday there came a dash of warm rain as he rode
into the clearing, and at once he saw her in the doorway of the
sheep-shelter, a hooded gossamer about her shoulders.</p>
<p>He had brought her a gift,--a little work-box covered with
shells,--angel-wings and moon shells, Roman snails, and other
fragile fan-like shells of a sea they had never seen. On the
under side of the cover a mirror fitted into the blue silk lining
and in the various compartments were a needle-ball and a
pin-cushion and a tiny silver thimble.</p>
<p>Amalia, to whom gifts were rare, was quite beside herself with
joy at the daintiness of the treasure. Almost were the strange
queer shells symbolic to her of things to come,--unknown journeys
with Matthias to far-off seas, hearing the sound of wind in
whipping sails and the call of the gulls on the sand.</p>
<p>But when Matthias would have gone in to see her father, she
put him off again. She had meant to break the news, she told him,
but always when she was about to speak, her courage had failed
her. If he would give her but another week, she would prepare him
for the announcement which would so anger him. Of one thing she
was certain, it must come first from her own lips.</p>
<p>But on the following Sunday when he arrived there was no
question about Matthias interviewing the father this time, for
Wilhelm Stoltz was away,--gone to one of the church friend's home
many miles up the river. It gave Amalia a delicious sense of
freedom so that she was as gay as a child.</p>
<p>She had a wonderful piece of news for him,--she had used the
thimble and one of the needles. Already she had started a
quilt,--the Tree of Life pattern,--<i>Baum des Lebens.</i> Even
now two finished blocks were in the shell box.</p>
<p>"Ever since I was a tiny girl I have sewed," she said to him.
"It comes very easy to me. Many times I have made things for my
hope chest"--<i>hoffnung Kiste,</i> she called it--"knowing I
must some day wed but not knowing who the man would be. When I
knew it was but my father's friend Herman . . ."</p>
<p>She sighed, so that Matthias' arms went around her again and
he drew her close. "But it will be no Herman now . . ."
<i>(kleine Taube) . . .</i> "little dove."</p>
<p>"No . . . never. And this is so different . . . to think of
you as I sew."</p>
<p>But even while she clung to him she told him this: "I wake in
the night and think of this which I am doing contrary to my
father's wishes. I feel then that I am wicked . . . but when
morning comes I know that it is not wicked at all . . . just
happiness and right."</p>
<p>And when Matthias said nothing could come between them now,
she confessed: "Of that I am sure . . . and yet I am sad to part
from my young brother Fritz. That is my greatest sorrow. As for
leaving our good people . . . they will all be angry and hurt . .
."</p>
<p>But Matthias turned that away with lover-like speed. "When
they know how much we love each, other . . . they will see that
it could not be otherwise." Of such are the simple rules of
youth.</p>
<p>"But my father has so often said only woe comes to those who
marry outside the church."</p>
<p>"Love . . . our kind of love . . . is greater than the
teachings of a single church."</p>
<p>And now that the afternoon was waning she was anxious and
alert about her father's return.</p>
<p>"What was that, Matthias?" she would say, startled.</p>
<p>"Nothing . . . some little wild thing . . . a chipmunk or a
squirrel."</p>
<p>And because of her constant watchfulness on this Sunday,
Matthias was firm. "You shall cease your worries," calling her
<i>liebes Kind.</i> "It is not good to fear so. It shall not go
on longer. Next Sunday I shall tell him, and we will face the
consequences. If he is too angry, I shall take you home with me
on Trixie with no baggage. My aunt will take you in and we shall
be married at once."</p>
<p>He kissed her again and again, held her close to him, could
scarcely bear to leave her. Even when he had mounted Trixie and
was riding into the timber road he turned back for the last sight
of her.</p>
<p>She stood just in front of an alder thicket, and as he looked,
she raised her hand high in farewell.</p>
<p>He carried that picture with him all the way home: Amalia, a
little blue and pink and golden figure against the green of the
new leaves, as though Spring herself had just stepped out of the
alder thicket. His <i>kleine Taube,</i>--little dove!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c04" id="c04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The week dragged for Matthias,--seven days that were weighted
down with the iron of horseshoes and kettles, plowshares and
skillets. The first part of it was all sunshine and mild showers,
but on Thursday night a storm broke. The rains came in torrents.
All day Friday they lashed and tore at the woods and the
prairies. All night and all day Saturday and all that night they
beat in a fierce onslaught. A part of the mill-dam went out and a
weakened span of the river bridge could not stand the pounding of
the flood waters. On Sunday morning the water was roaring and
lashing through all the creek-beds and then spreading less
turbulently over the valley, inundating all that which had been
pasture lands.</p>
<p>Matthias made every attempt to make the trip to Amalia. All
day he worked, hoping to find some means whereby he could get
through. Many times he rode back and forth seeking some more
narrow place where Trixie could make the crossing. But always it
was too wide or too turbulent. He tried getting her into a flat
boat but she reared and kicked and was completely beside herself
with fear. He knew that even if he had been able to manage a boat
through the roaring waters for himself the distance for walking
was so great that it would have taken into the night to get
there.</p>
<p>When he gave up the attempt, he stood for a long time on the
bank as the water swept by. In a mental rage he watched a pigeon
fly straight for the Big Woods community. How impotent was man.
Only the birds could lift wings and soar high over the flood
waters. Amalia was waiting for him over there but he was helpless
in the face of nature. A winged thing could fly to its mate. Only
man and the beasts must cling to the earth and crawl.</p>
<p>But on the next Sunday he could get through. The river was
still high and the creek-beds running full, but man's ingenuity
had made the river passable with a temporarily trussed-up bridge
span.</p>
<p>He took a lantern with him for he knew he might be well into
the night getting back. This was the day he was to confront
Amalia's father, possibly the day he was to bring her home with
him. He had a feeling that there would be a scene, ending, no
doubt, in his taking Amalia away without baggage. If it came to
that, he was prepared to do so.</p>
<p>Two weeks not to have seen her! The time had been
interminable. But he was on his way at last even though the going
was formidable. Sometimes Trixie sank in mud so deep she nearly
floundered. Sometimes he had to dismount to clear fallen branches
away from the wet timber road. Then he would mount and ride on
with the air of a conqueror glorying in this journey which was to
end by his claiming that which was his own,--the girl who had
been his from the moment he first saw her. Occasionally he felt a
bit of the winner's sympathy for his fallen adversary. But to
have pledged a little sixteen-year-old girl to a mere family
friend was unthinkable. Yes, if there was to be a scene, let it
come to-day.</p>
<p>These terse thoughts went through his mind like so many
pigeons going over, homing always to Amalia. He tied his horse in
the dripping woods. This was the end of secretiveness,--on that
he was determined.</p>
<p>She was not in the clearing. That would be on account of the
dampness. He strode over to the sheep-shed. She might be there
hiding mischievously from him. But she was not at that trysting
place either. Might she be ill?</p>
<p>With that disquieting thought he started walking over toward
the road that led to the house. Suddenly he stopped short. There
was no kettle hanging there in the clearing,--only the
tipped-over tripod of hickory sticks and the sodden black ashes
of the last fire. Something seized him,--a premonition of
impending disaster, so that he started on a lope toward the home
buildings. A tow-headed young boy, the same who had directed him
on his first visit, was coming toward him also with some haste.
They met almost at the edge of the timber where the plowed land
began.</p>
<p>"You didn't come last Sunday," the boy said in English. "I
about give you up to-day, too . . . was just comin' to the
clearin' once more. She said to give you this."</p>
<p>And he thrust into Matthias' hands a note directed in the
precise and shaded letters of the German script.</p>
<p>As Matthias took the letter and tore hastily into it, the boy
stepped away and began pulling bits of bark from the shaggy coat
of a soft maple.</p>
<p>Even before he had read a word, Matthias knew it contained
nothing but disaster. For a few moments, then, he stood looking
at the neat script, frozen to immobility, too fearful of the
contents to read.</p>
<p>To speak the language was easy enough,--he had heard it on all
sides from boyhood. But the reading was more difficult for he had
been to English schools, even to the Princeville Academy for a
short time, and the writing of the language had been confined to
early copy-book work. So it seemed that he must translate into
English as he read.</p>
<p>In his agitation some peculiar instinctive knowledge of what
had happened helped him to make the translation. By a labored
reading, skipping some of the phrases, he got the gist of it:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>This is news . . . convey to you . . . wagons of
church people ready now . . . make long journey . . . new land.
Men did not return . . . sent word by letter . . . meet them
Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory. There they await us . . . show
way to new lands. It is there in Nebraska City I
marry.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>And something more at the last pertaining to God and
forgiveness for which Matthias at that moment was neither
interested nor caring.</p>
<p>The words were all swimming together and the earth was falling
away from his feet. He felt giddily ill. The boy who had been
watching him covertly came up importantly then and Matthias saw
him as through a haze. "She said she wanted I should get this one
to you, too."</p>
<p>The second note was neither precise nor neat. It was
ink-blurred, hurriedly folded, almost it might have been tear
stained. In a fever of anxiety to release himself from the shock
of the stunning news of the first letter he tried to read it
quickly.</p>
<p>In his haste the translation seemed to be:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>Matthias, my cruel note under command my father was
written. This one I send after. The wishes of my father . . . can
no longer hold out. Many times myself I ask why we met when
nothing could be. I better could have gone on not knowing
you,--indeed, I had not been too unhappy.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>One sentence stood out with grim sardonic insistence--"One
must not marry outside the church."</p>
<p>Near the last there was a sentence over which he labored to
get just what she meant: "<i>Manchmal sage Ich mir vielleicht ist
es besser unsre Liebe zu gedenken als es war im Frühyahr."</i>
And when he got it, he knew it was: "Sometimes I tell myself
perhaps it is better to remember our love as it was in the
springtime."</p>
<p>There was something, too, about the quilt blocks: "Unless I
can be with you again, I shall never finish. The pieces will lie
in my box. I think my heart lies there too."</p>
<p>Matthias looked up through the wavering tree trunks. Dimly he
saw the boy walking away. He called to him and gave him a small
coin. "Thanks for coming. What day . . ." his throat was so dry
the words seemed to crackle ". . . did they go?"</p>
<p>"Two weeks come next Wednesday."</p>
<p>The Wednesday after the Sunday in which he had left her
standing so lovely there, in the clearing. Involuntarily he
turned his eyes toward the alder thicket not far distant. For a
moment he could see her as plainly as though she were there in
reality. Then the picture grew dim, and nothing remained but the
green dripping boughs of the alders.</p>
<p>Mechanically he turned toward Trixie, stumbling blindly into
the protruding roots of a tree stump. When he reached the mare he
did not mount her but walked along with the bridle over his arm,
taking the right trail only because Trixie led him into it.
Occasionally she touched his shoulder with her cold soft
nose.</p>
<p>The pungent odor of the loosened moist leaves under them came
up to him with every step. A meadow-lark sang its liquid notes at
the edge of the clearing. Gone. Amalia was gone,--into the great
unsettled west,--to be married there. It was a nightmare from
which he would soon waken. No, it was true,--the reality after a
short sweet dream.</p>
<p>Shaken to the depths, his thoughts tumbled about uncertainly
in a whirling world. One emotion after another went flooding
through him as the creek waters had flooded the lowlands. A
sickening sense of loss and disappointment. Astonishment,--he had
never dreamed of any other turn of events than that the seekers
for land would first return home as Amalia had said. Self-remorse
that he had been so slow. Self-chastisement that he had not
forced some means of crossing the river. And then violent anger
at man's feeble efficiencies,--at a God who had sent the water to
overflow, at the tyranny of the father, at the narrowness of the
church, at the weakness of the girl.</p>
<p>His body seemed drained of blood so there was no strength left
in him, and he threw himself down on a wet and matted bed of oak
leaves where they had turned to brown pulp.</p>
<p>Over and over in his mind he relived the circumstances of
their meeting: the love that seemed to spring between them from
that very first day, the trysts in the woods, the softness of her
lips and the feel of her body in his arms. His <i>kleine
Taube,</i> little dove.</p>
<p>All these weeks. And now he would not hold her in his arms in
another week, nor in another month, nor a year, nor a decade, nor
<i>ever.</i> Never! It rang in his mind like the brassy sound of
a jangling bell. There was hollowness in the spring, mockery in
the song of the meadow-lark. Life was empty, drained of its
reason for being. He threw an arm across his eyes and turning his
face down to the sodden earth, shed wild and angry tears.</p>
<p>For a long time he lay there in the midst of the fallen world
in which disappointment and disillusion were the only factors.
What matter now that the meadow-lark trilled the prairie's love
song to the spring? Of what portent that the sun shone? That the
sweet odors of the waxy white May flowers near by were heavy on
the air? These were not of his man's mind. Over and over he lived
the imaginary scenes of the journey upon which Amalia was being
taken,--saw the covered wagons pulled through the stickiness of
the mud with the father loudly chiding the lovely girl by his
side,--visioned the arriving at the territorial town, the Herman
of her betrothal meeting her, the marriage against which she was
revolting. At that, in his sick imaginings, he felt himself
snatching her away bodily from the outstretched arms of this
strange man--</p>
<p>Suddenly a thought struck him with lightning-like effect.
Immediately he sat up and brushed a hand across his eyes, a dozen
things crowding his mind at once. The colonists were to meet the
men in that far-off Nebraska City. Amalia couldn't be married
until the wagons reached there. How long would it take them to
make the trip? Four weeks, perhaps, if there were no delays. They
had been gone twelve days.</p>
<p>The town lay hundreds of miles across the Illinois and Iowa
plains on the Missouri River, a long, long journey. It had become
a sort of gateway to the new country, the hub of the overland
trails which stretched from it and on to the west beyond. It was
the beginning of the young man's country, the young man's hope of
wealth. Hundreds of them were seeking their fortune out there.
Why not do so, too? What matter that his uncle expected him to
stay and take over the business eventually? The Unknown Land was
calling. This accounted for his restlessness, his vague
irritation at everything about the little foundry. He, too, must
answer the call.</p>
<p>If he could but get to this Nebraska City in some way before
the wagons!</p>
<p>He read the note for the dozenth time. Amalia had told him the
father's plans for her. Was it a veiled suggestion that he try to
follow? To have said "Unless I can be with you again . . ." Did
she hope? Did she have it in mind even as she wrote? Well, then,
he would not fail her. He did not know just how or by what way,
but he, too, would go. Perhaps by taking the river route he could
arrive there ahead of the caravan. Then there would be no
marriage to a member of the colony. He would snatch her from
them, carry her away.</p>
<p>A wild exuberance seized him. His grief passed into a sense of
exaltation, as though the thing were already accomplished. He
jumped to his feet, shook the soggy leaves and twigs from his
clothes, mounted Trixie and was off, crashing through the narrow
dark timber road.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c05" id="c05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>To the Lutheran homesteaders the journey out of Illinois and
into the plains of Iowa had been a tedious and apparently endless
trip. For weeks now they had lurched over trails which took them
through prairie grass and sunflowers, down creek-beds and across
gulleys, into tangled clumps of wild growth and past an
occasional settlement. It had rained much of the time and the
crude wagons drawn by stolid oxen and heavy-footed plow-horses
jerked through thick black mud or jounced over the uneven dry
ground until some of the women were ill from the torture of the
constant shaking.</p>
<p>Day after day the prairie-schooners had crept on to the
west,--a winding procession like so many tiny, gray-colored bugs
following a twisting line on the wide expanse of a school-room
map. The cracking of the blacksnakes, the stentorian calls of the
drivers, the creaking of the wagons, were all the sounds heard as
the caravan made slow and tortuous progress toward the
ever-receding rim of the world.</p>
<p>Night after night they had formed in a wide circle around the
fires, their cattle and horses corralled by this human perimeter,
more safe from any potential marauder than if left outside of it.
There was no danger from the redskins in Iowa, they felt,--but of
Nebraska they were not certain. It had been only a few years
since the alarm had been spread in the town of Omaha concerning
the report of Indian outrages, and the militia had gone out to
subdue the Pawnees at Battle Creek. No more Indian troubles had
been known in the eastern third of the territory for a half-dozen
years, but the men said no one could ever tell when it might
break out again. On beyond there were tribes of them always ready
to steal cattle and to commit various offenses, but it was
scarcely to be supposed that they would attack so large a
group.</p>
<p>Today, Amalia, riding beside her brother in one of their two
wagons, was shaken almost to the point of illness, for never had
the trail seemed so rough. Although the household things had been
packed together as solidly as possible, sometimes when the horses
forded a creek-bed or lumbered down a rough incline the chairs
and walnut bureau knocked together, and the new soap-kettle with
its perfect rounded bottom took to rocking back and forth
perilously.</p>
<p>The menfolks had said they thought they must be getting near
the Nishnabotna River region which lay only a few days' journey
this side of the Missouri. All indications seemed to point that
way. They were rather excited about a possible sight of the Big
Muddy in a few days now.</p>
<p>But Amalia took no great interest in this news. She made no
inquiry, commented on nothing,--merely clung to the seat of the
lurching wagon and lived over again the days of her
leaving,--days whose happenings would be forever burned in her
memory.</p>
<p>She had been working on her <i>Baum des Lebens</i>--Tree of
Life--quilt-block in her bedroom, had hidden it quickly as her
father came to the door. She could still see him standing there,
big and bustling, filling the doorway, dominating the scene, his
sandy beard and thick mustaches almost bristling with
importance.</p>
<p>"Well, Amalia, I have news."</p>
<p>"News?" she had said, her body going suddenly cold.</p>
<p>"Yah, the men do not wait to return. Instead they have sent
word to us. They have found suitable lands many miles to the west
of the town of Nebraska City. We are to go as soon as possible
and meet them there in that territorial town."</p>
<p>Sitting here beside her brother now, on this endless, lurching
journey, she could feel again the faintness stealing over her at
his "We go now."</p>
<p>He had shouted it, excited because of the coming important
event. "Fritz brings me the letter just now. You I tell first."
He laughed at his joke: "You are the favored,--the one of all
honored by me to know first."</p>
<p>"We go?" She had repeated it in a whisper.</p>
<p>"Yah! Fritz at once rides to the homes of our people. It is
like the <i>Paulus Rewere</i> Fritz told us from school. To-day I
give the command. Each knows his part. There shall be no delay.
It is, as I have said, like an army under orders,--the army of
the Lord. You know your part well. At once the extra baking and
roasting of the meat. Then, even as these cool, the last of the
packing. The sacks of oats and the seed corn at once Fritz loads
in the second wagon. Myself I oversee all. Come Wednesday morning
we start . . . Thursday at the latest. That day come the Dunbars
to take over the house."</p>
<p>Riding silently by Fritz she was living it all over again,
trembling a little now even as she had trembled then. She had
tried to tell him.</p>
<p>"Father, I must tell you at once. I do not go."</p>
<p>"Do not go?" The syllables had been lightning bolts.</p>
<p>"No . . . for I cannot now marry Herman Holmsdorfer."</p>
<p>"Have you lost your reason?"</p>
<p><i>"Nein."</i> At the dear thought of Matthias she had gained
a bit of courage. "It is only that the young man at the foundry .
. . you recall where we bought the kettle . . . ? Do not be
angry, Father . . . he has been here several times since."</p>
<p>"Has he . . . ? He has . . . molested you?"</p>
<p>Amalia flinched again with pain at the memory of the evil
thing her father had suggested. How could he have so translated a
beautiful thing? How could there ever be evil when two people
loved the way she and Matthias did?</p>
<p>"Father! He loves me . . . and I . . ."</p>
<p>"Go on . . . lest in my anger I strike you."</p>
<p>". . . I love him, too, Father . . . so much."</p>
<p><i>"Du Narr!"</i> he had flung at her, calling his Amalia a
fool for loving.</p>
<p>Lurching through the sodden wild grass of the Iowa prairie,
she closed her eyes now as though she might forever shut out the
period that followed, a time as of a great storm which lashed and
beat with words, which closed over her in its fury of commands
and threats, so that rather than drown in the beating stress of
it she had promised obedience.</p>
<p>If only she had acquiesced for once and all at that time, but
she must do something which merely made matters much worse. On
the evening before they were to leave she had rolled a few things
into a little bundle, slipped out and started down the timber
road toward Matthias so many miles away. At the sound of a
horse's hoofs thudding behind her she had slipped into the
underbrush at the side. But she had not been quick enough, for
the lantern's light had focused itself upon her like an evil eye,
and her father's cold voice had ordered her to come forth. Well,
her spirit was crushed then. There was nothing more to do.</p>
<p>In two things only had she been deceitful,--in writing a
second letter to Matthias after the dictated one, and in bringing
the shell box with her. She had written her heart out to her
lover in a note dictated by no one, and, when ordered to leave
the dear gift behind for Mrs. Dunbar, she had pretended to do so.
But even now it was in the wagon wrapped in many layers of
unbleached muslin sheeting.</p>
<p>"What have you there?" her father had asked as she brought out
the yellow-white bundle.</p>
<p>It was then that she had openly lied. "The freshest of the
bread," she had answered. And if God would not forgive her, she
did not even care.</p>
<p>For the first time after all the tragic days, riding now with
Fritz, they spoke of the unhappy situation. The fifteen-year-old
brother had something on his mind which had worried him for
weeks. He could scarcely speak for the closing of his throat
against the words. "I . . . myself I hate, Mollia. This you do
not know before. It was I who told Father I saw you go down the
timber road. I did not then know the reason. I would not . . .
would not . . . have harmed you."</p>
<p>"Do not worry. Nothing was your fault."</p>
<p>"Are you then so unhappy?"</p>
<p>"I can never know happiness again, Fritz."</p>
<p>The youth shook his head. "It is bad. You should not be
unhappy. You are so pretty. We could have managed . . . Father
and I. I am a man now."</p>
<p>It broke something in Amalia, some tight-bound band around her
heart and throat which had not been loosed for days. She, who had
been like a dead woman for all this time, wept wildly. Her young
brother needing her,--her lover wanting her. The church pulling
her one way,--Matthias another. Obedience asking one thing,--love
another. Why did God bring such agony into the world? They taught
you God was good. Was it true?</p>
<p>The wagon lurched on through the miles of sodden grass and
sunflowers, thickets of sumac, wild plum and Indian currant.</p>
<p>After a while she calmed. "Fritz, I confide in you. You will
never tell on Amalia?"</p>
<p><i>"Nein,</i> sister."</p>
<p>"I am praying that I shall see him again," and did not notice
that she was turning to the God about whom she had so recently
questioned. "Is it too much to ask?"</p>
<p>"How can that be? So far away?"</p>
<p>"Always in the back of my mind, Fritz, I have it that he might
come too, that getting my letter on Sunday after the Wednesday we
left he would try to overtake us even though so far away and seek
me out."</p>
<p>"It is a big thing to hope for."</p>
<p>"He was like that." She spoke proudly. "And his love was like
that."</p>
<p>"I wish for you it could be." He glanced shyly side-wise at
his sister.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I wish it so much that I make myself think it could
be. Do you think it could come true, brother?"</p>
<p>"It could come true," he answered simply. And if he kept to
himself the thought that it was not likely, that no one could
ever overtake another in this vast ocean of prairie country, it
was out of boyish sympathy for Mollia.</p>
<p>Ahead of them lumbered slowly as always through the sodden
grass the other wagon belonging to their father and the two of
the Schaffers.</p>
<p>Amalia turned now and glanced back across the wide spaces of
the prairie. Behind them on the trail came the three wagons of
the Kratzes, the two of the Rhodenbachs, the two of the
Gebhardts,--four of them oxen-drawn, three with teams of horses.
She knew the outfits, every horse and ox as well as their own. As
always there were only these same plodding creatures,--no
other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c06" id="c06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Matthias Meier was standing on the dock at St. Louis,
surveying the scene before him with both impatience and
satisfaction.</p>
<p>A wilderness of steamboats confronted his vision. Some were
just leaving dock, the hoarse coughing of their exhaust-pipes
making discordant notes. Others were coming in, the screeching of
their whistles adding to the already deafening din. Small boats
slipped in and out and between the larger freighters like busy
waterbugs, twisting and turning with insect abandon. The air was
charged with the electric-like energy of movement.</p>
<p>As he surveyed the vessel <i>Missouri Queen,</i> in which he
was to make the rest of his trip up the Big Muddy, he had the
complacent feeling of already having accomplished his
objective.</p>
<p>He had arrived in St. Louis without mishap and the overland
travelers would be moving much more slowly than he,--of that he
was sure. The stolid oxen and heavy-footed horses pulling their
clumsy prairie-schooners would do scarcely more than sixteen
miles per day. There would be the long halts to make camp. Added
to that would be the perverseness of the cattle the settlers were
driving, their stubborn stops and futile meanderings off the
trail. The rains, too, were delaying the caravan, no doubt. Black
Illinois and Iowa mud would be an obstacle with which to reckon.
Even at this date he would wager anything they had not gone
one-third of the way across Iowa.</p>
<p>Rains would not delay the steamboat, he thought exultingly.
She would slip up the Big Muddy and land him in Nebraska City
before the colonists had arrived. To see Amalia face to face,--to
confront her father,--nothing could then keep her from him. He
thought rather shamefacedly of his agony there in the woods when
all the time the remedy of it was possible.</p>
<p>He surveyed the vessel now with a boyish sense of
proprietorship. Never having been on a Missouri River steamer
before he eagerly took in the details of this one that was to
house him for his long journey.</p>
<p>She was an attractive-looking craft, one deck above the other,
the pilot-house and texas still above those. The whiteness of her
newly applied coat of paint made her look very aristocratic
riding there majestically on the slow rise and dip of the river,
a little like the birthday cakes his aunt had made,--the main
deck one layer, the boiler deck another, then the texas,
containing the suite of rooms for the vessel's officer, topped by
the pilot-house high over the river so that the height of the
pilot might stress the clarity of his vision in seeing down into
the sandy channels. High above all these towered the two lofty
smokestacks carrying their sparks away from the roof and giving a
strong draft to the furnace,--the candles on the cake, he
thought, and grinned to himself at his whimsy.</p>
<p>Two cannon faced bankward in both directions, probably used
now only for the purpose of firing salutes, but carrying withal
that gesture of authority for any loitering miscreants.</p>
<p>She was about two hundred feet long and perhaps thirty-five
wide, he decided. The bottom looked flat. His curiosity keen, he
asked a Negro crew-hand near how much water she drew and was told
with much grotesque flapping of large hands that she was "drawin'
thirty inches now, boss," but would be down to fifty when the
five hundred tons of cargo were all aboard.</p>
<p>That cargo was now being loaded,--great hogsheads of molasses,
household goods, horses, wagons, mules, bales of hay and oats for
the stock aboard, these latter supplies to be replenished in St.
Joseph.</p>
<p>The vessel was propelled by a steam wheel,--two engines on the
respective sides connecting directly with the wheel shaft. The
last word in river craft, she had steam capstans in the
forecastle and two huge spars for that possible occasion when she
would have to be pushed over the tricky shifting sands of the
river.</p>
<p>"Dis old ribber . . ." the deck-hand contributed, "she done be
onreli'ble as a gal."</p>
<p>It set Matthias' mind to working again, momentarily drawn away
by the reference to woman and her caprices. Where was Amalia now?
Where the ox-train creeping over the plains? What if it were
farther along than his judgment had told him? He grew anxious at
the thought.</p>
<p>"There must be no delay," he said. "It's necessary that I get
to Nebraska City as soon as possible."</p>
<p>At which the dark boy gave a white, flashing smile and threw
out those expressive brown flappers. "Yas sah! Ah'll tell old
Missie Ribber about dat."</p>
<p>And then they were leaving,--with the hoarse sound of
whistles, bells, chugging of wheels, Negroes' songs, laughter,
sobbing, farewells. It gave Matthias a momentary pang in
remembering his recent parting from the good uncle and aunt whose
disappointment at his going had been so keen, the latter of whom
had given him a needle-book, admonitions, a New Testament,
mittens, advice and packages of quinine, calomel and catnip.</p>
<p>Leaning on the railing now, Matthias' blood beat warm within
him. This was the real part of the journey. On to a new
country,--a new start in life! On to Nebraska City in the raw new
territory to be there when the Lutheran settlers came in! His
enthusiasm over the future knew no bounds. Some of it was an
impassioned emotion over the fact that he would still have
Amalia, some the natural reactions after his grief and
disappointment, some his forward-looking plans for a new business
in a new country, and some of it was merely Hope of Youth.</p>
<p>The gang-plank was up now. They were really under way. Crowds
thronged the rails. Almost all were calling out their last
farewells. It seemed that Matthias was the only one without
friends left behind. No, there was one other,--a sun-burned,
leathery-looking sort of young fellow apparently about his own
age. They were not far apart, and through some interchange of
thought, perhaps, just now their eyes met in a quick appraising
look. So friendly did each seem to find the other's expression
that almost simultaneously they drew together at the rail.</p>
<p>"First trip?" the young chap asked Matthias.</p>
<p>"Yes. Yours?"</p>
<p>"Nope. First one was ten years ago when I was nine. Mother was
a widder woman. Took us up the Muddy to find a home. Landed at
Plattsmouth. Just three or four houses there then,--Mother knowed
one of the families. Had to sleep on the floor with several other
newcomers. Toward mornin' door opened and three old Injun bucks
come in and stepped around all over us lookin' down in our faces.
Had the hardest time gettin' Ma to stay and settle. She was all
for leggin' it back to the steamer still tied up to the post and
vamoosin' in favor of returnin' to civilization." And the young
fellow laughed long and hilariously.</p>
<p>They told each other their names and destinations.</p>
<p>"Charlie Briggs."</p>
<p>"Matthias Meier."</p>
<p>"Plattsmouth in the main, but stoppin' in Nebraska City,
claimin' my team I left there and pushin' on to Plattsmouth
'cross the prairie."</p>
<p>"Nebraska City is where I'm stopping for a time."</p>
<p>There was other information Matthias gleaned from his
new-found friend that first afternoon of their acquaintance.
Charlie Briggs had learned surveying. He had a homestead not far
from Plattsmouth but mostly his younger brothers looked after it
while he was off on all sorts of surveying, freighting and
scouting missions.</p>
<p>"Volunteered a year ago last October to help put down the
Sioux Injuns. Saw the Plum Creek massacre in Phelps County,--got
home the very day last April year, the life o' the best president
of these here United States got snuffed out."</p>
<p>Both were silent for a few moments,--that wordless reverence
of all Union men for the fallen leader.</p>
<p>But not for long could Charlie Briggs remain silent.</p>
<p>He knew--and talked of--the great Platte Valley, had been up
the Elkhorn, taken one trip to the Republican Valley. The Platte,
he said, was flat and by nature treeless. It had shallow, muddy
water, swarms of mosquitoes and greenhead flies, prairie-dog
towns and rattlesnakes,--the country of the Elkhorn was rich and
fine with quite a bit of natural timber along the creeks and
rivers. He explained the trails, north and south of the Platte
River,--the one on the south with its converging trails like the
tines of a fork starting from Independence, Missouri, St. Joseph,
Leavenworth, and Nebraska City.</p>
<p>He had all the information of the new country at his tongue's
end,--the difference of the soil in the Platte, the Elkhorn, the
Republican, and the Loup Valleys. He knew where the native trees
thrived--the cottonwood, and the oak, the elm and the ash. He
knew the Indian tribes, their locale and their habits,--told
Matthias about the old Pawnees that had once lived in the Valley
of the Republican, the Kitkehahki tribe, and the chief who at the
instigation of the young Lieutenant Pike had ordered down the
Spanish flag flying in front of the lodge and raised the Stars
and Stripes; related the story of the attack on the Arikara
Indians by the soldiers from Fort Atkinson who were joined by the
Sioux enemies of the Arikaras, how they overpowered them and
feasted on the Indians' roasted corn while the peace treaty was
being negotiated.</p>
<p>He had at his tongue's end the history of much of the
territory since the days of Coronado and his Spanish horsemen who
had once set out to discover the mythical land of Quivira with
its silver and precious stones and its king who slept under a
great tree with golden bells on its branches, and found instead a
vast plain with wild grass and Indians and queer cows with humped
backs.</p>
<p>He enjoyed the telling of these tales and not in all the
afternoon did he cease from imparting them. "Follow the
prairie-dogs and Mormons and you'll find good land," was one of
his sage pieces of wisdom.</p>
<p>It rather fascinated Matthias, the young man's ready knowledge
of the territory since an earlier day,--and his own more recent
adventures.</p>
<p>"Killed buffaloes? Lord, by the dozens. Pick on your animal,
shoot, skin the carcass, let it freeze, chop off a hunk with your
ax, throw it in a Dutch oven and a couple hours later get
busy."</p>
<p>With no recess for his monologue, he went on:</p>
<p>"Buffalo used to be swimmin' along here where we are most any
time. They tell a yarn about a greenhorn seein' 'em once for the
first time when he was off in a yawl with a passel o' old timers.
This fellow could handle a rope right smart, so they got him to
set in the bow with a lasso and the first one they should wound
could be roped. Some of the crew fired and wounded one but the
greenie threw the rope over the head of one that wasn't hit. The
crew shouted and backed oars to get old man Buffalo in deeper
waters, but his feet touched bottom and he went up the bank with
the boat tied to him and would have took it on a cruise all over
the prairie if the stem of it hadn't been wrenched off and
carried away by the mad animal. Fellows was left shipwrecked far
away from their steamboat."</p>
<p>Matthias grinned his skepticism. "Funny how the fellow
couldn't have let go of the rope."</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs spat over the railing: "Never spile a good
story . . . and besides rope wa'n't so plentiful they wanted to
give any away."</p>
<p>"Any hostility along here now from Indians?" Matthias had
carried the question in his mind for some time.</p>
<p>"Naw. Only a few years ago they was barricadin' decks and
state-rooms,--keepin' up day and night vigilance. Mostly now any
hostilities is above the Niobrara from the Sioux tribes on
farther west. Pawnees is friendly."</p>
<p>By dusk the boat tied up for the night,--navigation through
the treacherous sand-bars was too precarious. If Matthias chafed
at the lost hours, he had only to remember that the overland
travelers were making camp too.</p>
<p>He and Charlie Briggs sat out on the deck talking until the
mosquitoes drove them in, when they joined the other passengers
in the too-crowded parlor-like cabin,--for the most part a motley
crowd of fussy old ladies with poodle-dogs, anxious mothers with
sleeping children, planters, giddy young girls, whole families
moving to the new country, many unattached men. Immigration to
the territories of Kansas and Nebraska was heavy.</p>
<p>There was some attempt at music that evening in the stuffy
cabin,--a group of young fellows volunteering the tear-jerking
"Thou Hast Learned to Love Another" and "Meet Me By Moonlight
Alone" and the rendition of "Marching Through Georgia" with an
aftermath of sullen remarks and a miniature reproduction of the
late war on an after-deck.</p>
<p>Matthias' eyes swept the clusters of young girls coldly in
spite of the evident admiration for his stalwart figure some of
them plainly showed. Not one was little, dainty, fair-haired and
blue-eyed. How could a man care for any other type?</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the boat proceeded very slowly on
its up-river journey, gliding along smoothly enough over the
turbid water. On the seventh day it put in at Weston for repairs.
Matthias chafed over the delay until Charlie Briggs hinted
broadly: "Ye'd think the' was some <i>reason</i> why ye
<i>got</i> to git there."</p>
<p>Matthias, however, was non-committal. He would never wear his
heart on his sleeve, particularly to one he had known no longer
than young Briggs. But unlike as the two young men were, there
were qualities which drew them together on the whole trip,--a
common love of adventure and progress, sincerity of purpose, and
some unnamed characteristic which each felt in the other,--a sort
of gallant attitude toward humanity.</p>
<p>It was the morning of the ninth day out before they could
proceed. The weather turned cold and disagreeable. There was no
more promenading on the wind-swept deck by the giggling girls.
There were various rumbles of dissatisfaction from the
passengers, too, for eatables were getting low and fare was very
poor.</p>
<p>They were in Kansas now. One side of the river bank was sheer
steep bluffs, the other vast stretches of prairie, dotted with
patches of timber. It all looked very wild.</p>
<p>On the eleventh day they docked at St. Joe. A child died and
was taken ashore by a hysterical family. A doctor was called
hurriedly from the passengers to attend a woman in childbirth in
one of the stuffy state-rooms. A young bride came aboard on her
way to California, happy and blithesome, thinking that all
California was a paradise. Life is a loom, weaving gay colors
indiscriminately with those of somber hue.</p>
<p>And now the long journey was nearing its end. They would get
to Brownville on the twelfth day,--the seat of the United States
land office in which Daniel Freeman only a little over three
years before had obtained the first homestead in the whole
territory just after the midnight hour of the day in which the
law went into effect,--the place from which the first territorial
telegram had been sent six years before. From there to Nebraska
City was but a short journey.</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs in his loquacious way was recounting much of
this to Matthias now, recalling some of the anecdotes concerning
slaves that had been brought through this section by way of the
underground railroad.</p>
<p>The two young men were sitting on deck on the Nebraska side
looking shoreward, Charlie Briggs pointing out some distant
upstream spot.</p>
<p>"Along nigh about a dozen miles over there is the way John
Brown brung slaves many's the time from Missouri by way of Falls
City, Little Omaha, Camp Creek and Nebraska City to Tabor, Iowa.
Can pint out the barn to ye in Falls City they hid in whenever .
. ." His high-pitched voice broke off.</p>
<p>There had been a grinding noise, a quivering of the boat's
frame. With a sickening shiver, as a huge animal might shake in
the steely mouth of a bear trap, the <i>Missouri Queen</i>
stopped.</p>
<p>"Sufferin' snakes!" Charlie Briggs jumped up. "We're on a
sand-bar."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c07" id="c07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When the <i>Missouri Queen</i> settled grumblingly into the
treacherous sand which had shifted since the steamer's last trip,
Matthias was a picture of surprise and irritation. "How long will
it be?" he wanted to know at once.</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs who had known the river since his childhood
days shrugged lean muscular shoulders. "Can't tell. She may be
settin' pretty."</p>
<p>And settin' pretty she was.</p>
<p>Now came the work of the two huge spars which like the legs of
some gigantic insect swung into position as though the white bug
of a steamer intended to walk over the water and be at once on
its way. But the bug stupidly lay thrashing impotent legs and
could not move.</p>
<p>With every available means the crew and some of the
passengers, including Matthias and Charlie Briggs, attempted to
get her off. Men in small boats put out to shore and drove stakes
into the bank, around which they would wrap the rope attached to
the vessel, and pulling this with mighty tugs attempt to entice
the vessel from her sandy bed. And every day she seemed lazily to
settle farther into the shifting silt of the treacherous
river.</p>
<p>Four full days went by filled with exertion on the part of the
workers and with irritation over the delay by all hands.</p>
<p>Matthias was beside himself with anger and worry. Under normal
conditions he would have chafed at the delay. Now he was
tormented with the thought that after all these days the ox train
might have arrived at Nebraska City. Sometimes he tried to
comfort himself with the thought that there would be much more
delay for the horses and oxen than this unlooked-for delay of the
steamer. He reminded himself of all the minute and trying things
which would come up to delay their progress. There would be the
shoeing of the oxen, tires to be set on more than one wagon, a
broken spoke perhaps, the constant delays for rounding up the
driven cattle, early twilight stops in order to make camp,
none-too-early starts after a cooked breakfast and repacking of
the camp utensils and bedding, and always the black Iowa mud
after a rain. But once the steamer was off and on its way again
nothing would stop it excepting nightfall.</p>
<p>On the fifth day they pulled off. The next day they were
caught again by another sand-bar throwing its treacherous arms
across a channel which had been traversed easily on the boat's
last trip.</p>
<p>This time Matthias slumped into the depths of despair. This
time he was moved to confide in Charlie Briggs concerning his
love for Amalia, his friendship for the young chap having
progressed to this point. Once he even wildly suggested the
possible purchase of a horse from some passenger, swim it to
shore, there to take to land. Charlie Briggs dissuaded him from
this, pointing out his lack of knowledge of his surroundings,
called to his distracted mind that when they pulled off, which
might be any time now, their progress would be better than
Matthias' blind ride through an unknown country. It took all the
weight of his argument to make Matthias realize the folly of the
plan. Movement was what Matthias wanted,--to feel his legs
moving, the motion of a galloping horse under him,--wings.</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs tried to cheer him. "I know that there Iowa
gumbo," he would say: "Haint no mud like it anywheres. As bad any
day as a little sand for holdin' you aback. They'll be slowed up
fit fer goin' crazy, any the time there comes a rain."</p>
<p>It drew the two young men together,--Matthias' confidences and
worry, and Charlie Briggs' sympathy and encouragement because he
had nothing more practical to offer. Although they were unaware
of it at the time, it was, in truth, the beginning of a long
friendship interrupted only by death,--a friendship which was
rather unexplainable to the casual observer in the later years of
their lives when they appeared to have so little in common.</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs was right. The delay was not so long this time,
and the second day they were out of the treacherous sucking sands
and into deep water, passing a large Indian encampment on the
Nebraska side almost at once.</p>
<p>No more heart-breaking delays! No more anxieties and nervous
questioning. The next day--Brownville. A few hours after
that--Nebraska City, there to wait for Amalia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c08" id="c08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>And now near the Iowa bluffs the overland travelers had broken
camp for the last time before they were to sight the Missouri
River.</p>
<p>Slowly the eleven wagons had crawled up and down the last of
the unending Iowa trail. Ploddingly men had walked beside the
oxen and cracked the long bull whips which circled over the
stolid beasts' backs but never touched them. Patiently the women
had sat in the covered wagons for all these weeks waiting this
day of entering the new territory in which they were to make
homes for their men. Most of them had come on the long trek
against the desires of their hearts, for always the woman clings
longer to the old hearth.</p>
<p>Young Mrs. Henry Gebhardt had given birth to a child on the
way. Anna Rhodenbach had become betrothed to Adolph Kratz. Old
Grandpa Schaffer, taken with summer complaint, had died and been
buried in eastern Iowa.</p>
<p>But now the endless journey lay behind them,--with the worried
forebodings of young Mrs. Henry Gebhardt, with the childhood of
Anna Rhodenbach and Adolph Kratz, with the unbroken sleep of old
Grandpa Schaffer beside the trail in eastern Iowa.</p>
<p>They were soon to see the Big Muddy. And although several
days' journey lay beyond it, still it was the gateway to the new
home.</p>
<p>Fritz was continually straining his eyes toward the west
hoping to catch the first sight of the river. But Amalia turned
often to look back along the trail where the other wagons of the
train stretched out like the long lash of a whip.</p>
<p>"Always, Fritz, I foolishly look for the strange wagon or the
lone rider. Sometimes I think I see it so plainly that I wonder
if I am a little mad."</p>
<p>"There's the river way, too, Mollia. Some one of the men had a
paper printed in the big town of Omaha many miles to the north.
There it said river crafts come up from the towns to the south
and unload their goods."</p>
<p>He unwittingly gave her renewed hope, against which she strove
to turn, fearful that it might buoy her up too much and make her
suffering more keen when it should come to naught.</p>
<p>And then suddenly from the top of a rise they saw it,--the
River! Almost simultaneously some one ahead had shouted back the
news. And soon others behind were shouting, too. There it was
ahead of them,--the Big Muddy, its waters tawny with the clay of
its high banks,--rolling on to its union with the Father of
Waters. On the far side,--the Nebraska Territory.</p>
<p>They could see cabins across the wide expanse of water.
Nebraska City that was,--cabins and shacks in a sheltering
cluster of trees, and a ferry-boat which must be summoned from
the far side.</p>
<p>Wilhelm Stoltz, as master, was to go across first with his
wagon and the heavy mares whose shaggy legs were like
pillars.</p>
<p>There was the long wait, and then: "Come, Amalia," he called
loudly. "We go now. You are the first woman of our people to
cross. It is good luck for you. Good luck to meet Herman there,
too, huh?" He repeated <i>"Gutes Glück"</i> many times. He was
jovial, excited that the Nebraska Territory was in sight,--had
almost forgotten his daughter's foolish idea that she had liked
the young foundryman. <i>Verrückt,</i> she had been.</p>
<p>The ferry came over, so very slowly. But it did not come too
slowly for Amalia. Rather she would have waited here on the Iowa
side, prolonged the time before she must meet Herman who might
even now be among those people over there on the levee.</p>
<p>They were down on the platform-like boat now, Amalia and her
father and the one covered wagon with the shaggy-haired team. So
many trips it would take to get all the colony across the river.
Fritz must stay on the Iowa side with the other wagon, awaiting
his turn.</p>
<p>They were crossing the muddy water now with that feeling of
being too close to the dark turbulent waves. Amalia looked down
at the turbid waters. They were thick, impenetrable. One could
not see one inch beyond the muddy surface. Nor one hour into the
future of one's life.</p>
<p>The coming of the ferry-boat had brought a scattering group of
people down to the dock. From shore came a confused noise of
laughter, braying stock, rumbling wagons, and the pounding of
hammers far up on the hill. The wind was blowing hard on the
river and Amalia with one hand held to her sunbonnet which
rattled starchily in the breeze,--with the other she clutched a
hard bundle of unbleached muslin.</p>
<p>The ferry-boat docked with a rattle of chains and the crowd
idling about the wharf, pressed forward.</p>
<p>"Prettiest gal I've seen yet. She can have me, Pete," Amalia
plainly heard an uncouth tobacco-stained individual say.</p>
<p>"Sst! Careful!" his companion idler whispered. "This here
fellow comin' is lookin' for her."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c09" id="c09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The <i>Missouri Queen</i> had passed Brownville. Charlie
Briggs in his self-appointed duty of handing out data to any and
all who would listen had been regaling several passengers during
the afternoon with all the information he possessed concerning
Nebraska City, the destination of many. He was still going strong
when the town itself was sighted from the steamer's deck.</p>
<p>"The old Nuckolls House burned six years ago. You should a'
seen it." As a matter of fact Charlie Briggs had never set foot
in its interior, but that did not deter him from his
description.</p>
<p>"The night o' the dedicatin' made river history, I guess. All
the toniest of the folks on the river from Brownville, Omaha, St.
Joe, even as fur away as St. Louis come. They say champagne
flowed upstream agin the current from St. Louis,--that many a
sedate and long-faced citizen was cuttin' capers agin mornin'
come."</p>
<p>"Did you say it burned?"</p>
<p>"To the ground in the big fire that destroyed most all the
early buildin's of the town. Raged for hours, but volunteer fire
boys couldn't save 'em."</p>
<p>It was sunset when the <i>Missouri Queen</i> docked at
Nebraska City, greeted with artillery and a self-elected
welcoming committee of countless men and boys on the levee. Most
of the passengers who were going on to Plattsmouth, Omaha and
Sioux City came on shore to bid good-by to these acquaintances of
several weeks. Young girls who had not known each other at the
beginning of the journey clung together in tearful farewell. Men
promised to send for others if ventures proved successful. Women
parted with promises of undying friendship and favorite recipes.
Two engagements were announced between fellow passengers. Life
acquaintances had been formed.</p>
<p>But Matthias had little time for all this display of emotion.
He was anxious to get located, to see the town, most of all to
ascertain whether the caravan of Lutheran settlers had come
in.</p>
<p>The founders of Nebraska City had displayed a good deal of
optimism in its baptismal name he decided. It was not much of a
city, he could see, although the town proper looked to be on the
bluffs back from the river while crude shacks and cabins
clustered around the lower village. Twelve years old now, it had
a courthouse, several stores and churches, a school and hotels,
so Charlie Briggs had told him. But if Matthias' youthful
interest in the little city was keen, it was superseded by the
important fact that his rival for Amalia was probably somewhere
here in the town at this very moment. He might even be one of
these many men down at the wharf.</p>
<p>Just where to go for information concerning the Illinois
homesteaders he was not sure, so the immediate call for action
was to take his valise and seek out the hotel. He said good-by to
Charlie Briggs who was to stay with a cousin in a log-cabin in
the lower town which he now pointed out to Matthias.</p>
<p>"If you hear any news of these people I'm looking for, you
would let me know?" Matthias questioned.</p>
<p>"I'd do that very thing." Charlie Briggs' little blue eyes
twinkled under the tumbled forelock of his red hair.</p>
<p>"As for me, I'll clean up and eat and then start out. Maybe I
can hear something." And then Matthias was on his way to the
hotel.</p>
<p>At the hotel,--a two-story structure with a porch across the
front,--Matthias washed and ate his supper alone under the
kerosene lamps' glow. The dining-room was well filled. These were
the more comfortably fixed travelers eating here he knew,--most
of the incoming settlers would be camping just outside the
town.</p>
<p>Apparently that was a bride and groom nearby,--he in
broadcloth, white-collared and beaming, she in her bridal suit
with pale-blue plumed hat,--and the conversation too low for
Matthias to catch excepting the fact that they were hiring some
one to take them over the Cut-off trail to Otoe County. Matthias
wondered how the brave blue plume would face the prairie winds
just now so vigorous.</p>
<p>At the other nearby table a group of men discussed the
construction of the new Union Pacific Railroad. The names of
Durant and General Grenville Dodge were being used freely, but
whether they were two of the men present or were merely being
discussed he did not know. The conversation included references
to General Dodge having come on to Omaha to take charge of the
entire construction of the road, and a protracted discussion as
to the respective merits of building it out the north Fork Platte
toward Fort Laramie, out the south Fork Platte, or due west where
the Platte divides at Lodge Pole creek.</p>
<p>He soon knew that General Dodge was not present in the group
but rather under discussion.</p>
<p>"He knows more of the possibilities of the country from the
Missouri River to Salt Lake than any other American engineer," he
heard, and several references to Dodge's former experiences as an
engineer among the Indians who had given him the name "Long Eye"
after seeing him use his surveying instruments.</p>
<p>The men seemed elated over the fact that the first sixty miles
as far as North Bend had been completed, damned the redskins
superbly for giving constant trouble, discussed the possibility
of the Union Pacific beating the Pacific Central being pushed
eastward in California, referred to "The Moving Town," calling it
"Hell on wheels," and laughed long and hilariously at the reply
some Jack Casement had given General Dodge when he asked if the
gamblers were now quiet and behaving,--"You bet they are,
General, they're out in the graveyard."</p>
<p>All this overheard talk of large spaces and big projects
filled Matthias with a renewed interest in this raw country to
which he had come. What his own part in its upbuilding would be
he did not even know yet. He must get into something right
away,--something important so that his life work would be started
early. He was not without a substantial sum of money,--for that
he was thankful. Amalia, first,--to see and take Amalia from her
people,--that was of primary importance just now. Then to get
into the work of this big opportunity-filled territory and make a
place in it worthy of them both.</p>
<p>"You're Mr. Meier?"</p>
<p>Matthias looked up to see a waiter addressing him.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"A gentleman outside to see you, sir."</p>
<p>He pushed back his chair and went immediately to the door
which opened on the hotel veranda. It gave him an excited feeling
of anticipation as though even now he knew there was to be news
of Amalia.</p>
<p>He stepped outside where June bugs thumped about clumsily and
the sound of voices and a banjo came harshly from one of the
saloons across the street.</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs stood there in the pale light which the hotel's
lamp cast across the wooden platform. He came up soberly, turned
his lean and freckled face away.</p>
<p>"Reckon' I got bad news for ye, Matt."</p>
<p>Even then Matthias knew he would always remember the
expression of unspoken sympathy on the young fellow's homely
weather-beaten countenance. Twisted, his face looked, as though
he might be in physical pain.</p>
<p>With no word Matthias stood tense and expectant.</p>
<p>"The Lutherans got in day afore yistiddy." Charlie Briggs
dropped his usual high-pitched voice to a hissing whisper.
"Yistiddy they went on west to their land. The girl was married
here . . . just afore they pulled out."</p>
<p>Matthias stood with no word, staring at the burned and
leathery face of his informant, just as he had stood in the
Illinois woods weeks before and stared unseeing at a younger boy,
so that it seemed he was living some portion of his life all over
again. But it went through him swiftly that this time there was
no way out,--no recourse now from a decision which was beyond his
changing. He had a distinct sense of finality, as though life
were ending here on the porch where Charlie Briggs'
weather-beaten face screwed itself into pain and the June bugs
thumped on the wooden porch floor.</p>
<p>There was, then, to be no full fruition of any hope for
him,--ever.</p>
<p>With a last grasping effort, as a drowning man clutches for
something solid, he asked: "You're sure? There's no . . . no
mistake?"</p>
<p>"There's no mistake. My cousin's woman's sister saw the
ceremony from her cabin. Two couples was married. 'Twas out by
the wagons by the side o' the new Nebraska City Cut-off trail . .
. Luther'n preacher . . . 'n all kneelin' near the wheel ruts fer
the prayin' afterward. One of the brides' faces was whiter'n
limestone, my cousin's woman's sister said, and a Luther'n woman
standin' by told her it was account o' a team o' horses sudden
rarin' nearby . . . but my cousin's woman's sister said it had
looked thataway long 'fore ever the horses acted up."</p>
<p>For a time the two men stood with no more words between them.
Through Matthias' mind went a kaleidoscopic turning and twisting
of parts of pictures, never forming any whole, merely grotesque
and fragmentary shapes,--swollen streams--crumpled
letters--rushing waters--dripping timber--covered wagons--driven
cattle--Amalia's white face, whiter than limestone,--high
cliffs--muddy waves--and always a nightmare of clutching hands
pulling his body down into a maelstrom of smothering
quicksands.</p>
<p>Sand! Sucking sand! It always held you back from your heart's
desire.</p>
<p>Sand! Moving sand! It ran forever through an hour glass.</p>
<p>Queer he had never realized that about sand before. Some sands
held you in their slimy grasp and would not let you go. And while
they clutched you tightly, horribly, other sands slipped down,
down through the hours, pushing time on until everything was too
late.</p>
<p>Too late! Too late . . . too late . . .</p>
<p>"Sorry, Matt. If I can ever do anything more fer you . . ."
Pain in Charlie Briggs' leathery red face.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Charlie." Mustn't let Charlie see that no one can
ever do anything more.</p>
<p>They were shaking hands. The tight grip of Charlie Briggs' two
iron hands couldn't help.</p>
<p>Matthias turned and went back into the hotel and up to his
room. For a long time he stood in the middle of the floor looking
at the wash-bowl and pitcher and the grayish-white towels on the
rack and tried to think just what had happened. He had come too
late. On account of sand! Sand! Sand that held you back like the
tight grip of two iron hands. So that other sand could run
through the hour glass and make you too late . . .</p>
<p>Too late . . .</p>
<p>He dropped on his knees, by the side of the bed, burying his
face in his arms.</p>
<p>Oh, <i>kleine Taube,</i> little dove . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c10" id="c10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Amalia rode quietly at the side of her new husband, Herman
Holmsdorfer. She had no spoken reproach for her father, uttered
no word of rebellion toward the man who had acquired her
body.</p>
<p>Herman possessed her now,--he had a woman to keep his house
and cook his food and lie by his side at night. He was secretly
proud of her prettiness, too, but it would not have done to tell
her so. Far more than the prettiness was the fact that she could
cook and sew and scrub, tend chickens and help plant when he
needed her. Also she would bear him many sons. Seven,--<i>ach</i>
in the Fatherland one would get something for that. Here they
would give bounty only for coyote skins.</p>
<p>Riding along the Cut-off trail he was fully satisfied with
life as he knew it. One-hundred-sixty acres of good rich Nebraska
Territorial soil for his portion at the end of the journey, a
team, a woman of his own,--one of only two children, too, so that
when Wilhelm Stoltz died Amalia would get half of her father's
homestead. And Amalia being his, the land would be his. Must
discourage any sign of remarrying in Wilhelm,--that would not
do.</p>
<p>One-hundred-sixty acres, a good team and a woman,--thus did
Herman Holmsdorfer gloat on his good luck and although he did not
analyze the statement, thus did he grade them in point of
value.</p>
<p>Loudly jovial he was on the trip. Amalia had gone to his head
like a drink of <i>Roggen Branntwein.</i></p>
<p>"The best cabin of all for you I build. Not a house of sod as
the people far out on the prairies away from a stream, nor yet
dugouts from the earth with only boards and branches and strips
of sod over them. What think you? Of good logs from the natural
timber along the river and creek-bed where is the fine land we
have chosen. Say something, woman." He dug a heavy forefinger
playfully into Amalia's pink cheek. "Is it not good?"</p>
<p>"It is good," Amalia said quietly.</p>
<p>Very quiet she had been ever since the day by the Cut-off
trail near Nebraska City. Tractable, too, she was, and carefully
polite to Herman. But something had frozen in Amalia's being that
day, as the roots of the lilac bushes back home freeze in the
winter. Outwardly pleasant and obedient, her heart had crept into
an inner room, hurt and bleeding, to hide forever from the people
about her. The <i>kleine Taube,</i> little dove, had been
wounded,--but only wounded, so she could not die.</p>
<p>Thereafter she lived in two worlds,--the practical one in
which all these others moved and had their being, working hard
when the wagons stopped, taking her turn at the cooking, washing
out the necessary clothing in the streams for her father and
Fritz, and now Herman,--and another world in which she existed
apart from them, entirely aloof in her thoughts and with nothing
in common in her emotions. With characteristic docility she
submitted to the rough caresses of the heavy-jowled man beside
her, but by some cool withdrawal of the spirit found it possible
to remain forever away from him.</p>
<p>For several days the ox train headed west on the trail, turned
from it at the point designated by Herman and rode miles again
across the wild treeless prairie, the long grass dotted with the
white of daisies and the blue of prairie gentians.</p>
<p>Twice they sighted small bands of Indians and were frightened,
and twice the scare went into nothing.</p>
<p>For a way beyond the Big Muddy the country had been
undulating, a succession of rolling hills and prairie land. They
rode through hills and valleys, uplands and lowlands, dark sandy
loam and black bottom lands, blue joint verdure, and course
slough spikes. And the feet of the oxen crushed a thousand wild
blossoms in the prairie grass.</p>
<p>Sometimes the way was as level as a floor,--sometimes they
went up and down through gullies and creek-beds. Sometimes the
skies opened and the wagons stuck fast for hours in the black
mire. Sometimes the sun shone and the drying winds blew, and they
made fourteen miles a day. Sometimes they passed greenish
sloughs, and occasionally near the streams, a virgin
timber,--boxelder, elm and willow, burr oak, hackberry and ash,
and the tangled vines of undergrowth. A few times they passed
cabins, two or three were occupied, some were abandoned claim
shanties. Once they halted by a pond of muddy water, warm and
brackish, and once by the clear sparkling water of a spring-fed
stream. All this where one day there would be villages and towns,
churches, schools, countless farms, paved highways, concrete
bridges and searchlights sweeping the night skies for the
guidance of the mail planes.</p>
<p>Herman rode proudly all this way at the head of the caravan
for it was he who knew the way to the new homesteads. On the
sixth day he made a sudden halt, got out of the wagon and waved
wildly to those few in his vision. One by one the wagons reached
those already assembled, the drivers wondering what had caused
the mid-afternoon stop.</p>
<p>"It is here that the lands begin," Herman had been saying to
Amalia, ". . . here you shall keep my house for me."</p>
<p>"Yes, Herman," Amalia had said,--little Amalia who was to live
in the same house with Herman, but always in Another Room.</p>
<p>It was then that three strange young men on horseback rode out
to meet them. And now ensued a protracted argument. The young men
had arrived during the absence of the Lutheran scouts, broken sod
in a sizable area of prairie, built a shack, and what was to be
done about it?</p>
<p>It was nightfall before the Lutheran men had come to the
conclusion to buy the squatters off. Loath was a hard-working
thrifty German to part with good money to English-speaking
squatters, but after an assembled meeting of the heads of the
Stoltz, Schaffer, Rhodenbach, Kratz, Gebhardt and Holmsdorfer
families, they decided to offer the men one hundred dollars to
leave. The young men wanted three hundred. The answer to that
mathematical problem was as plain as the nose on every German's
face,--two hundred.</p>
<p>So the deal went over and the young men settled on land
adjoining that of the colonists,--a small enough business deal at
the time, but one to be fraught with far-reaching consequences,
for it came to be in time that they and their descendants mixed
the English language and customs, English schools, and church
services, social events and marriages with those of the
Germans,--until no longer could one pick out the descendants of
those Lutherans from the children of the English.</p>
<p>The business finished, all the new German settlers gathered
around the huge central fire which had been built. Wilhelm Stoltz
raised his great hand and a hush fell on them. When the least
child had grown quiet he thanked God for leading them into the
land which would nourish them and their children after them and
their children's children,--told Him that He was closer here to
his followers than He had seemed in the land from which they
came.</p>
<p>Amalia, looking up at the low-hanging stars shining like so
many yellow buttercups in a forest clearing, wondered why He
seemed so much farther away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c11" id="c11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Immediately the settlers went to work to lay out the farms.
That all might border the river, they figured out a system
whereby they narrowed each holding and allowed it to extend
farther back so that every homestead might have its full
one-hundred-sixty acres. Thus each family could have access to
water, and because of the narrower measurements, be slightly
closer to each other for protection from the Indians in case
there was trouble. They realized that this homesteading out
farther than the Omaha area might bring on Indian depredations
any time.</p>
<p>For many days Wilhelm Stoltz and Herman Holmsdorfer, Rudolph
Kratz and August Schaffer on horseback, with small pocket
compasses and the lines from their horses' harness, laid out the
acreage into the eleven farms, for there were that many men in
the group over twenty-one. Wilhelm Stoltz nearly shed angry tears
that Fritz was only fifteen. It seemed such a waste of years to
be but fifteen with all this fine land everywhere.</p>
<p>All camped by the wagons near the river while the farms were
being surveyed, with every one anxious for the day to come when
that particular phase of the work should be finished so that the
building might begin. The women cooked and washed at the river's
brink, and gathered for the fires the dead branches of trees
along its banks and the dried buffalo chips out on the
prairie.</p>
<p>This camp was made in more permanent fashion than those of
one-night duration on the way. Now several stoves were set up
with quilts hung behind them to lessen the onslaught of the wild
winds from across the open country.</p>
<p>Many times the two who had come to pick out the land, Herman
Holmsdorfer and Rudolph Kratz, were congratulated for their
choice. How terrible, the various members of the company said,
not to have had this river with its native timber. Several times
they had passed settlers on the way who had chosen land far from
trees, claiming it was richer or lay more level. It was because
they had not scouted about as Rudolph and Herman had done. There
was wide, open prairie land here for the good crops which soon
would grow, but there was timber, too, even though not large like
the Illinois trees.</p>
<p>On a hot day in July with the wind stilled before the sullen
approach of a storm, the work of the surveying was finished. It
was a momentous occasion, for now came the choosing of the farms.
They gathered about in a close circle. Herman Holmsdorfer placed
all the numbers of the tracts on pieces of paper. Young Henry
Gebhardt wrote all the names of the families on similar pieces.
The numbers were placed in one hat,--the names in another.</p>
<p>"Who shall draw?" they asked.</p>
<p>"The two brides," some one said. "Anna Kratz and Amalia
Holmsdorfer."</p>
<p>"The two brides," others chorused. "It is good luck for us
all."</p>
<p><i>"Gutes Glück!"</i> was heard on all sides.</p>
<p>"Hush!" said Wilhelm Stoltz, Amalia's father. "You talk of
good luck. Ask instead the good God for His help and
protection."</p>
<p>He raised his great hand high above his head and his loud
voice rumbled forth, addressing <i>Gott im Himmel.</i> A similar
scene had taken place on a far New England shore over two hundred
years before. "Thou hast led these Thy chosen people . . ."</p>
<p>Amalia bowed her head. Why were the Lutherans chosen before
all others? Was it true? How were they sure?</p>
<p>Love,--a very human love for one not of her church,--made
Amalia Holmsdorfer all the years of her life liberal and kind to
those who chose to think differently from her own people.
Protestant, Catholic, Jew, and Gentile, those of Mormon faith and
those of no faith at all found succor at her door until the day
of her death.</p>
<p>And now the drawing. Anna Kratz drew a number. "Eleven . . ."
she said in a clear, ringing voice.</p>
<p>Amalia drew a name to match with it. "Herman Holmsdorfer," she
said quietly.</p>
<p>They all shouted and laughed at the joke. "Amalia is so
anxious to get started she draws her own name first."</p>
<p>She looked down at the paper in her hand stupidly. It was
true. Holmsdorfer was her own name. She had not remembered for a
moment.</p>
<p>In the midst of the laughing and chattering Wilhelm Stoltz
raised his hand high again. <i>"Stille!"</i> And there was
immediate silence, for Wilhelm Stoltz, by some forcefulness of
character even more pronounced than the other men also of
domineering ways, was their acknowledged leader.</p>
<p>"Of one thing we have not thought. The years will pass. Our
children and our children's children will live here on these
farmlands. Better they should live side by side those of the same
blood. Look you,--if ought happens to any of us,--to be taken in
sickness or by death, it should be better that my Fritz and I
dwell beside Herman and Amalia that the land may lie
together."</p>
<p>"That is good," Herman shouted, and added to
himself,--"Three-hundred-twenty acres of land I own instead of
one-hundred-sixty should old Wilhelm and Fritz die before me."
Almost he was licking his lips at the thought.</p>
<p>It was better so, the men agreed. The women were mere
onlookers, consenting readily to whatever satisfied their
men.</p>
<p>But one more question came from the lips of young Adolph
Kratz. "I am now husband to Anna Rhodenbach. Shall the homestead
I own lie then next to my father or her father?"</p>
<p>It was a weighty subject to be settled as the far distant
lightning forked in the western sky. Wilhelm decided, this
Lutheran Solomon, as he set himself up to be.</p>
<p>"Woman is frailer. It is thought she will die first. It is
even so in the English laws. The homesteads of the younger men
who have wives of our families shall lie next to the homesteads
of the wife's parents. Thus at the deaths of the elderly women
the daughter lives next to her father to care for him in his old
age."</p>
<p>It was agreeable to all,--this settling so glibly by a
domineering man the entire future of the lives of a dozen
families. But this fluent and smooth forecast was by way of being
something of a joke,--perhaps the Almighty may have thought so,
too,--for it was to be, that years after <i>Herren</i> Kratz,
Rhodenbach, Gebhardt, and Schaffer had been gathered to their
fathers, hardy old <i>Grossmütter</i> Kratz, Rhodenbach, Gebhardt
and Schaffer met summer afternoons on the porches of their fine
farm homes, ate their <i>Kaffeekuchen,</i> drank their
<i>Kümmel,</i> and jabbered endlessly in the old tongue, rather
to the annoyance of a younger and very American generation.</p>
<p>They now rearranged the drawing, grouping them in clusters as
agreed upon, three-hundred and twenty acres to the Rhodenbachs,
they to settle between the two families which homestead each
should have, three-hundred and twenty to the Stoltz-Holmsdorfers,
and finishing the others in the same fashion.</p>
<p>The sky was darker now. The low thunderheads were piling up
like a flexible mountain range that constantly changed in depth
and height and shadows.</p>
<p>They finished the drawing. Wilhelm and Fritz were to be at one
far end of the long line of homesteads, Amalia and Herman next,
young Adolph Kratz and his bride, Anna, next, and the others in
order.</p>
<p>No roads between these homesteads now. Later, along the side
of the vast acreage, a rutty road running as wildly as a vagrant
gypsy, dusty or muddy in summer, hard frozen or piled with
countless drifts in the winter,--then after a time surveyed and
"worked,"--still later straightened and graveled,--then leveled
and paved so that cars doing sixty or seventy need not slow down
and lose time where the oxen and the shaggy-legged horses of the
Kratz, the Schaffer and the Gebhardt, the Stoltz, the Holmsdorfer
and the Rhodenbach families once came to a lumbering stop in the
midst of the prairie grass at the creek's bend.</p>

<h2><a name="c12" id="c12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>If Matthias Meier drank the bitter dregs of disappointment
during those first days in the raw territorial town of Nebraska
City on the Big Muddy, there was too much activity going on about
him for any continued quaffing at the cup.</p>
<p>It was a time of action, of great physical deeds. Men hewed
and dug, sawed and hammered, broke sod and planted. The little
town was filled with the sound of pounding, of the crack of the
blacksnake, the call to the ferryman, the bawling of tired stock,
the creak of wagon wheels.</p>
<p>Scores of wagons, hundreds of horses, mules and oxen still
hauled freight from here across the barren plains to Denver. The
hot summer winds carried through the town's straggling streets
the odors of the river, of alkali dust, of sweating mules and
humans, of upturned grass and loam and subsoil. There was the
feel in the air of unseen forces,--the push and pull of strange
appeals. There was strength and vigor. It was a masculine world,
and all men were young.</p>
<p>Matthias, at twenty-one, was stunned and disappointed that his
plans for marrying Amalia had gone awry, but found shortly that
he was not destroyed. A frustrated life was not necessarily a
defeated one. He was too busy to be utterly vanquished by the
blow. Whom the gods would destroy they sometimes first make idle
rather than mad.</p>
<p>And Matthias Meier was not idle. There was too much to do. It
was too good to be a part of the great new country. Out here in
all this vast newness one might in time become wealthy,
influential, important. Free as the prairie wind itself, he could
go anywhere with any of these home-seekers or adventurers. He had
only to choose. Or so it seemed to youth.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, then, after those first days of crushing
disappointment followed by idealistic dreams of great success, it
was something of a deflation of his ego, to find himself again at
the humble task of shoeing horses. Even then it was the energetic
little Charlie Briggs who suggested it.</p>
<p>Plowshares must be pounded out and edged to turn the virgin
prairies. Horseshoes must be forged and shaped. Nails must be
made by hand. Much of this was to be done with the thousands of
people coming through the Nebraska City gateway to settle
westward to the Rocky slope. So blacksmith shops sprang up over
night. And Matthias Meier started one.</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs pushed on soon across the prairie to
Plattsmouth. Matthias had been sorry to see him leave. Out of the
milling throngs he was the one new friend.</p>
<p>"Well, good-by, Matt." He had stood by his wagon loaded with
supplies for the homestead which lay between Nebraska City and
Plattsmouth.</p>
<p>"Good-by, Charlie."</p>
<p>Neither referred to the intimacy of that hour in which the one
had glimpsed the heart of the other and given unspoken sympathy,
and yet each knew the other was thinking of it.</p>
<p>"Good luck, Matt."</p>
<p>"Same to you, Charlie."</p>
<p>"'F ever I can help ye out . . ."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Charlie . . ."</p>
<p>All that year and part of another Matthias Meier worked at his
blacksmith shop, shoeing his share of the countless hoofs that
came treading through this important gateway to the great
plains.</p>
<p>He lived in a man's world, journeying between his
boarding-house and the little shop, contacting only the masculine
portion of the groups of emigrants stopping there, although many
a feminine eye lingered longer than necessary on the young man's
stalwart body and fine head set so gallantly on his wide
shoulders. But not yet could Matthias see girlish attraction in
any one but the shadowy memory of a fair-haired girl standing in
front of green alder bushes and waving a farewell that was to
last forever.</p>
<p>And now it was 1867 and suddenly Nebraska was no longer a
territory. The territorial legislature which had met as usual in
Omaha, having drawn up a constitution containing a clause that
only white men could vote, found it returned speedily from
congress with the rebuke that no one should be kept from voting
because of color. Meeting again, it rectified the mistake, and on
March 1, 1867, President Andrew Johnson issued his proclamation.
Nebraska was a state.</p>
<p>Came now immigration in earnest. Matthias found that he and
the settlers of the previous summer had merely come in like the
first ripples in the run of the tide.</p>
<p>The great plains of which the newly born state was a part had
been dotted by the foot-prints of thousands of people crossing it
to the far west. For years settlers had been thinking of it as a
great hallway through which they must travel in order to get to
those other and more distant rooms where dwelt the Californians
or the members of the new Zion in the Great Salt Lake Valley or
the Oregon settlements.</p>
<p>Although the soil over which they trod was black and rich and
fertile as any beyond, few had lingered. The very vastness of the
prairie regions had staggered the mind. So from the days of the
earliest fur traders to the year 1867, the great fertile plains
beyond the Big Muddy had numbered only a comparative few.</p>
<p>But now they came. Came by the thousands,--especially young
soldiers, who having known adventure and having rebelled against
the idea of settling down to their old lives in the villages or
on the farms of placid New England, turned eyes to the west and
let them linger long on thought of the newly formed state with
its rolling hills and vast prairies. Many minds decided that the
possibilities there were as vast as the green-grown prairie
itself.</p>
<p>So the trek began. In they came by boat and by covered
wagon,--these strong young men from the northern and eastern
states,--American, German, Bohemian, Danish, some of the
sturdiest youth of the nation. Some turned to the founding of the
villages,--some to the carving of farms out of the raw prairie
land, but all to do their part in the building of a great
state.</p>
<p>Matthias Meier by instinct clung to the town. Nor did he
intend to shoe horses forever. Already he was thinking that he
who would bring in merchandise to sell to these newcomers would
make a good profit, or who would loan money out to them for good
interest, or set up a lumber business for their homes,--oh, there
were many ways to make a good living if one but chose
carefully.</p>
<p>Again it was Charlie Briggs who inadvertently helped him
decide his course.</p>
<p>The lean-visaged young chap was in Nebraska City en route to
Brownville. He sought out Matthias at his shop. It was July and
the hot sun beat down on the river town with its dusty streets
through which came the never-ceasing procession of ox teams and
wagons, with its ferry-boat and its crowded hotels, its steamer
in dock from down the river, its bawling cattle in the stockade
on the hillside, its unending movement, as though a gigantic gate
swung back and forth to let these enthusiastic newcomers
through.</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs had news. A committee from the new state's
legislature had finally picked the site for the capitol. The news
of the decision had just come in. Had Matthias heard?</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"A place on the open prairie out between Salt and Antelope
Creeks. Sufferin' snakes, Matt! Open prairie with only three or
four log cabins now. Capital of the state! Be a big town some
day. 'F I was town-broke . . . But none o' that fer me. I'll take
homesteadin' 'n a surveyin' gang 'n a chance to git a gun sighted
on a dam' Injun."</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs was right about locating in the newly chosen
capital! Three or four log-cabins on the prairie, was it? How
long would that be true,--with a capitol building going up, and
the legislature meeting there? Why, in no time at all there would
be more houses, a hotel for the legislators, stores, a school,
maybe a railroad. No capital city ever stayed a village. Three or
four log houses, indeed!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c13" id="c13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Matthias Meier started April first, 1868, for the village of
Lincoln, the new Nebraska capitol site, driving his team with a
wagon carrying merchandise of the most staple
variety,--unbleached muslin, sugar, salt, boots, flour. The wind
was strong and cold, and the trail faintly marked over the
prairie was deep mud through which the horses struggled with the
loaded wagon. By night he had made nine miles.</p>
<p>He had been told he would find a cabin en route and when he
sighted it in the late afternoon, a black dot on the bleak
prairie, he urged on the team. There he stayed all night with
bachelor brothers, graduates of Dartmouth, who had come west to
make their fortunes.</p>
<p>The next morning he started out in the rain which soon turned
to sleet. All day his team plodded toward the next settler's,
never passing a building or traveler. Now and then at the top of
a rolling hill he would glimpse another team ahead, always a
little fearful that its occupant was making for the same shelter
as he was, and from his experience he knew that any house he
might reach would be small.</p>
<p>It was after sundown when he drove up to the door of the
soddie. A big bearded man stood in the doorway and called out:
"Unhitch 'n put the hosses under shelter, friend. Then come in.
Always room for one more at Akins'."</p>
<p>Matthias unhitched, led the team to the rude shelter, fed and
watered them and then entered the house.</p>
<p>He found it contained two rooms, both of which were filled
with people, all the men in the front room around a box-stove in
which simmered green cottonwood, the women in the back room
urging a small and apparently stubborn cook-stove to put forth
its best effort in the way of boiling water for coffee.</p>
<p>He went back to his stock of groceries and brought in a sack
of cornmeal to add to the gastronomical part of the evening's
festivities. After what seemed endless waiting, and during which
time the feeble efforts of the little cook-stove almost died on
the altar of all vain attempts, there was supper after a
fashion.</p>
<p>Later for the simple reason that it made economy of space, the
women and children lay down crosswise of the two beds, while the
men disported themselves on the floor after the manner of the
spokes of a wheel, with the box-stove and its sputtering green
wood contents as the lukewarm hub. In the middle of the night,
with the wind increasing to the proportions of a gale and rocking
the little house, Matthias, almost frozen, picked himself out of
the wheel-like effect rather like a spoke which can no longer
hold out, and went out into the icy night to run up and down a
somewhat limited space of the open prairie and beat his arms.</p>
<p>With the coming of the sun, as though the two could not work
well hand in hand, the wind went down. Soon the sparkling ice had
gone and all started on their way, with loud and hearty
admonitions from the Akins to be sure and come again. Hospitality
on the prairie in an early day may have been only figuratively
warm, but never did it fail its fellow man.</p>
<p>At Balls Crossing on Stevens Creek, Matthias made a short stop
at noon, and then rode into the prairie wind, which was rising
again, facing its rough onslaught, his strong young shoulders
meeting its buffeting much as a swimmer breasts the current. But
its very robustness gave him a feeling of exuberance, that he
could meet the obstacles which would confront him in the new town
in the same way that he met the wild strength of the prairie.</p>
<p>In the west, clouds were piling on the far horizon, gray and
pink-tinged and gold-bordered by the sun slipping now over the
rim of the world, forming castles no airier than his own. For as
he rode he had dreams as wild as the wind: that plows would one
day go up and down all these hills and valleys, leaving behind
them broad new furrows; that endless fields of yellow grain would
shimmer in the sunlight; that villages and towns would cut the
horizon which circled him now in one unbroken ring.</p>
<p>Fantastic as it was, it persisted,--the mirage of the fields
and farms, roadways and villages,--and the picture gave him
companionship and comfort in the loneliness of his ride.</p>
<p>If he thought of Amalia, it was neither with the sharp pain
with which he had first lost her nor the dull heartache which
lingered long afterward. Rather it was with a touch of sadness
that he was beginning to forget. His memory of the depths of
agony to which he had been cast at the time bade him wonder now
how it had been possible to live and enter so whole-heartedly
into this new venture.</p>
<p>At that, his mind went forward again in its flight to the new
town which was to rise there on the prairie and in whose building
he was to have a hand. There were those who said the capitol,
even if built, would never remain there,--that the absurdity of
locating it on the raw prairie with only a few log-cabins about,
was so apparent that a short time would see its removal.</p>
<p>Suddenly he found himself defending its retention, thinking of
the newly formed town with a distinct air of proprietorship. It
made him laugh aloud,--his air of ownership when he had not even
arrived.</p>
<p>He admitted to himself that he had developed a distinct pride
in the whole raw uncouth state. This new Nebraska with its few
straggling frontier towns, its widely scattered soddies and
cabins, its countless acres of prairie grass, its undulating
hills and vast open spaces was far more something of his own than
ever his native state had been. Into the latter he had been born
with no volition of his own. Into this he had come of his own
determination and here chosen to stay. It belonged to him.</p>
<p>For a long time he had been sighting black dots on the far
horizon and then he knew them for the cabins constituting the
town.</p>
<p>The sun had almost slipped away. Nothing remained but a last
reflection of its gold on the tip of a cloud and in little yellow
pools of light on the prairie.</p>
<p>It was almost dark when he drove to the first cabin. It stood
isolated and aloof from any other of the small cabins and the
blacksmith shop. The burned walls of what had been a school-house
constituted the only other building in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Wide prairie land as far as the eye could see, three or four
scattered log houses, a blacksmith shop and the forlorn walls of
a little stone seminary! This, then, was the beginning of a
midwestern city in which one day there would be countless fine
residences and stores, a great University, paved streets and golf
courses, parks and libraries, school buildings and churches, and
the most beautiful capitol of them all from whose towering top
the statue of The Sower overlooks that which Matthias Meier and
his kind accomplished for the state,--as though the seed of their
early sowing had come to full fruition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c14" id="c14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In such manner did Matthias Meier and Amalia, the girl he
would have married, begin the years of their living in the same
new state,--the young man in the village that was to become a
city, the girl on a homestead among her church people,--their
lives as far apart as the vastness of the wild prairie which
separated them.</p>
<p>Amalia now put away her love for Matthias, if indeed one can
be said to put away anything which lies always in the next room
into whose silences one may slip at any time for surcease from
trouble.</p>
<p>Always it lay there before her,--the way of escape. She told
no one, could not have pierced the dull stolidity of Lena
Schaffer nor the childish cheerfulness of Anna Kratz if she had
made the attempt to tell them of The Room which held song and
laughter and fragrance. But many times when the body grew weary
of the hard work which was the portion of all the women, or when
the heart turned sensitively away from the rough ways of the man
who claimed them both, she would slip into this Room from whose
windows one looked into a dim cool clearing in the woods, and in
whose shadowy confines there was love and understanding.</p>
<p>Happily these little journeys into another realm could be
performed by some magic means simultaneously with practical work,
for otherwise they never could have been taken. Work was indeed
the portion of every man, woman and child.</p>
<p>After the homesteads had been drawn, each family drove to its
allotted acreage of one-hundred-sixty acres, living thereafter in
the wagons until a house could be built. Eleven units of
humanity, dotted up and down the river's bank for several miles,
a team and wagon for each, a cow and chickens, a plow and a few
household goods,--energy, courage, and hope.</p>
<p>Amalia's house went up in record time, for her father and
Fritz turned in at once to help Herman build,--to live in it,
too, until one for themselves could be finished on the next
homestead. Many times as they worked, they boasted of the fact
that they could use logs for the houses, and expressed their
contempt for the sod houses of many of the settlers who were away
from streams and timberlands, not knowing that the soddies were
warmer in winter and cooler in summer than any log house could
ever be.</p>
<p>Amalia had something of a fine cabin, rather more elegant than
that of Anna Kratz,--for it boasted a partition through it.</p>
<p>In truth, from the moment the initial log was laid for the
first of the eleven cabins, there never ceased to be a concealed
rivalry in the community over houses and hogs, children and
chickens, wagons and windmills. From log houses in 1866 on
through frame to the present days of brick and stone and
stucco,--from lumber-wagons on through rubber-tired surreys to
many-cylindered cars, there lay always under the jovial
neighborliness of each family a desire to get ahead of the
others. Let a Kratz buy a parlor lamp with a fat round globe and
purple pansies on its side, the Gebhardt, Schaffer, and
Rhodenbach women could not rest until fat round globes with
magenta roses or cerise lilies decked their own parlors. Through
all the years, human nature being as it is, two rooms in a log
house instead of one, or eight cylinders in a car instead of four
was a cause for rivalry.</p>
<p>In Amalia's house, they built the partition of small split
logs, not rising to the ceiling but at least above one's head,
which would make a good place for hanging washing in bad weather
or seed-corn when the big crops should be harvested. When the
cabin was finished, Amalia laid her rag rugs over the roughness
of the floor, set her walnut bureau against the chinking of the
logs and hung her pots and pans on wooden pegs protruding from
it. A few household goods, a gun over the door, a willow
fish-pole beside it, the plow and team, the cow and
chickens,--these only with which to conquer the wilderness!</p>
<p>Moving from the wagons into the newness of the little
two-roomed house did something for Amalia. It eased the pain
which lay always in her heart by giving her a floor to sweep and
a hearth to keep clean. An immaculate little <i>Hausfrau</i> to
her finger tips, she swept and cleaned and scrubbed her new cabin
until even the other women, excellent housekeepers all, began to
hold up Amalia Holmsdorfer to their feminine offspring as a
shining example of all that a <i>Hausfrau</i> should be, not
knowing that her work was an antidote for pain.</p>
<p>For the rest of that summer, hammers and saws were heard all
up and down the river until the cabins were finished, one by one.
Fritz and his father moved into their own by fall. All broke sod
so that a beginning should be made on the land.</p>
<p>If Amalia was known as one of the best of the housekeepers,
Herman might have carried the honors of being most adept at
breaking the new sod. He seemed to have a knack for it and the
others were always calling for him to come and help.</p>
<p>Sometimes when Herman was away at the plowing, Indians came
through the prairie grass, in their straggling, single-file way
of traveling, and frightened Amalia beyond measure, and often she
could see their signal-fires at night on the distant uplands.
Sometimes a long loathsome rattlesnake would coil itself in her
path when she went to draw water at the spring, and always after
sundown she could hear the howl of the coyotes in the timber near
the river.</p>
<p>Church services were held at first around the wagons, then in
houses. By fall when the last of the cabins had been finished,
all turned to the building of a little log church, which would
also be the school-house. They chose a site high on a knoll on
the Rudolph Kratz place, centrally located, where it would stand
like the eye of God overseeing all the valley.</p>
<p>Rock and sand for the foundation were quarried on the land of
Henry Gebhardt. The strong capable hands of those who had built
the cabins now built solidly and well the house of worship.
Ludwig Rhodenbach built the pulpit and benches. But not until
fifteen years later was the bell to arrive,--a big one that was
to cause the little building to vibrate with its every chime, and
whose echoes were to reach far and wide over the fertile
fields.</p>
<p>"There will one day be a pastor's house beside the church"--a
<i>Pfarrhaus,</i>--"and when there shall be a grave some day, we
shall then build a fence," Wilhelm said solemnly.</p>
<p>And Amalia, hearing him, looked about fearsomely at the
assembled group and shuddered. Death,--it could find its way
everywhere, even out here on the prairie. Who would it be?</p>
<p>It was young Mrs. Gebhardt's baby. Never strong from the day
of its birth on the journey, it sickened and died so suddenly
that not even the older women who might have helped with their
advice, <i>Flieder Tee,</i> and <i>Pfeffermünz Tee</i> had time
to arrive.</p>
<p>Emma Gebhardt was wild with grief. She rocked the little still
form and would not let them take it from her. Even when they made
a box for it and lined it with a quilt, she clung to the cold
little thing and would not let them take it. <i>Verrückt,</i>
they said she was. And crazy she seemed, until suddenly she broke
into sobbing and let them take it away, and they said the crying
had saved her.</p>
<p>It was a summer and fall of strange new experiences to
Amalia,--of the constant sight of the bend and the dip of the
prairie grass, of the loneliness of the cabin, of the fear of
marauding Indians and the lurking rattlesnake. And always the
hard work and the attempt to please Herman in every way so there
would be no loud faultfinding.</p>
<p>Winter came on. The snows came and made of each cabin an
isolated island in the vast sea of a snowy prairie. And life
became a mere thing of obtaining food. Squirrels, prairie
chickens, deer, rabbits, wild pigeons, all fell before the guns
of the settlers.</p>
<p>The bearded Herman in his great boots and heavy clothes came
and went, caring for his stock, oiling his harness, hunting,
tramping in with the snow falling from him and the wild winds
rushing in with him. Sometimes he called loudly and impatiently
to Amalia to hurry and do some task for him,--sometimes he
tweaked her ear jovially or dug his heavy finger into the
pinkness of her cheek. And through both moods Amalia was docile
and very quiet. Had it not been for the stupidity of his
understanding, Herman must have seen that having won her, he had
forever lost her.</p>
<p>She put all her mind to the doing of her share of the work.
Always she went at it vigorously and with deep responsibility,
for it was a fight for their very existence. Nothing was thrown
away,--nothing wasted. Every piece of dried <i>Kornbrot</i> had
its use, every bone its value to the last moist drop of its
marrow. Yes, a good <i>Hausfrau</i> was Amalia.</p>
<p>Sometimes when she was alone she took out the shell box from
its wrappings of unbleached muslin. All the time that her father
had lived with them while his cabin was being built she had kept
the box hidden in the bottom drawer of her walnut bureau lest he
know of her deception in bringing it. But even when she was alone
in the house and might have done so without detection, she did
not open the box, merely dusted carefully between the moon shells
and the Roman snails, the angel-wings and the other fragile
fan-like shells of a sea she had never seen. It was as though, if
she opened it, she might see her heart lying there, red and
bleeding, or a little dead Amalia.</p>
<p>And then suddenly the strangest of all the experiences was
neither Indians nor coyotes, nor yet the long dip and wave of the
prairie grass, but the fact that she was to have a child. It gave
a new thought to living, a queer concern and responsibility for a
life that was not her own and yet a vital part of it.</p>
<p>That second summer was hot and trying and a period of such
hard work for all that the tasks were never finished. Everything
was to be done at once. Herman worked early and late breaking out
raw prairie and planting it and harvesting but a meager crop,
lending his huge strength to the neighbors in exchange for help
from them at other times. Amalia tried to make garden in a spot
near the cabin, but the results were painfully disappointing. She
cooked and scrubbed, washed and ironed and bent her pretty
yellow-crowned head over tiny stitches for the child's simple
wardrobe, making the little garments from a voluminous white
petticoat of her own.</p>
<p>News of Indian trouble kept percolating into the settlement. A
man by the name of Charlie Briggs camped all night with Adolph
Kratz and August Schaffer when they went far to the north to buy
two cows. He was on some scouting trip in behalf of the Union
Pacific Railroad, told the men that Captain North with four
companies of fifty friendly Pawnee Indians in each company was
protecting the workmen during the building of the road since so
many had been killed by the Sioux and new stations burned.</p>
<p>On a late summer afternoon when Herman was away with Fritz and
her father cutting wild hay for winter's storage, Amalia, sitting
in the cabin doorway to get any breeze that might come through
the blinding heat of the prairie and bending to the tiny stitches
of the garment in her hand, looked up to see three Indian bucks
appearing before her, so noiselessly had they slipped around the
cabin from the other side.</p>
<p>She might have fainted,--indeed, she felt the darkness
slipping between her and the red of their ugly faces,--but for
the thought of the coming child. It gave her an added bravery,
the thought of the unborn child to be protected. Fascinated, she
could not take her eyes from the paint and the black plaited hair
and the muscles of their brown bodies that glistened in the
sunshine. A little bird staring hypnotized at a snake was Amalia
that summer afternoon.</p>
<p>They spoke among themselves in their low, guttural tongue,
seeming amused at her fright. They stepped inside and filled the
space so that Amalia could only shrink against the wall petrified
with fear, awaiting the end of the torture.</p>
<p>From that time they began a systematic search of the cabin,
handling a dish or pan, uncovering articles at will, drinking
from the jug of precious molasses which was the only sweetening
Amalia possessed.</p>
<p>From the bedroom one emerged with a pillow which they handed
back and forth to examine, tearing a long slit in it to see the
inside. Apparently they were highly amused at finding feathers
which now floated forth into the room in a fine snowstorm of
goose-down. As molasses still lingered on their fingers and lips,
they could not rid themselves of the feathers which clung
tenaciously to both.</p>
<p>For a long time they entertained themselves childishly with
the combination, paying not the slightest attention to Amalia
still staring in a frightened mesmerism at the spectacle. Then,
evidently tiring of the whole affair, they appropriated the jug
of molasses and without a backward glance departed as suddenly as
they had come,--riding their ponies in single file across the
prairie, until they were merely outlines against the shimmering
summer sky.</p>
<p>When Herman came, he looked sober, but tried to make light of
it, explaining the difference between these Pawnees and the
Cheyennes who were well worth being feared.</p>
<p>But to Amalia an Indian was an Indian, painted, fearsome,
dreadful. And although she tried to comprehend the difference,
she knew in her heart that had the friendly battalion of Pawnees
appeared at her doorstep even under the command of the white
Major North she would have dropped in her tracks. The sight of a
painted face framed in two tightly bound braids of coarse black
hair always gave her an ill feeling, so much so that when she was
middle-aged and attending a wild west show she turned her head
away and would not look when the Indians under Buffalo Bill's
leadership rode in.</p>
<p>The second fall was upon them. The mad winds blew and the
tumble-weeds came charging across the prairie like so many brown
Indian bucks riding wild ponies.</p>
<p>It was a cold, windy night in November when Amalia knew her
time had come. Herman saddled a horse to go for old Augusta
Schaffer across the prairie.</p>
<p>When she heard the sound of the horse's hoofs grow fainter on
the frozen ground she grew frantic with pain and fear of the
strange new thing which was happening.</p>
<p>And then a new fear came upon her, for with the sound of the
wind came far-off howls of coyotes on a distant hill. Her blood
chilled when she remembered the saying that there were two
occasions which brought them near,--times of birth and of death.
Each time the little cabin rocked in the onslaught of wind she
looked fearfully toward the rattling door to see whether or not
it held.</p>
<p>The two of them filled her ears with their howlings,--the
coyotes and the wind. When the wind came and threw itself upon
the cabin with its wild shrieking, the sounds of the wolves grew
fainter. But when the wind ceased for a moment she knew by their
blood-curdling calls that the wolves were creeping closer. Once
she cried aloud for she thought they were at the window, but it
was only tumble-weeds scratching at the glass.</p>
<p>All the time Herman was gone they alternated their eerie
calls,--the wind and the wolves,--until Amalia's own voice
drowned them both. And when she heard the howl of the coyotes
again, the cries of the new-born child mingled with them, and
Herman and old Augusta had come.</p>
<p>And then, lying there comfortably after her ordeal, a sturdy
man-child by her side, Amalia knew the age-old experience of
young mothers,--that nothing in the world mattered but the
welfare of that tiny bit of humanity which was flesh of her
flesh.</p>
<p>The child, Emil, throve and grew, and sitting in the rocker by
the cabin's window with him in her arms, Amalia knew happiness
and peace. She told herself that she would never again think of
the love for Matthias she had once known, making a sort of
childish bargain with God that if He would watch over her baby
and protect it she would promise Him this.</p>
<p>But later, when Herman would call her angrily to drop the
potatoes faster, or when he would punish little Emil for failing
in his baby fashion to mind immediately and unquestioningly in
the German way, she would forget her promise and slip away into
The Room in which she kept her memories. There she would think of
Matthias and all that he might have been to her, and in some
queer way which she herself could not fathom, would find a
certain surcease from the trials.</p>

<h2><a name="c15" id="c15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>All the days were filled with hard work for every member of
the colony. They were not long enough to accomplish all that the
men wanted to do.</p>
<p>To Wilhelm Stoltz, Amalia's father, and to Herman Holmsdorfer,
her husband,--to the other heads of all the families, Rudolph
Kratz and his son Adolph, to the Gebhardt men, the Schaffers and
the Rhodenbachs, the wilderness was a giant with which to
wrestle. It must be fought,--more, it must be overcome or it in
turn would conquer them.</p>
<p>There were a thousand things to do to make it subservient to
their lives, to bring food for the body and safety of living.
Daybreak found them at work, darkness only bade them cease from
it. New prairie sod was turned, clean-cut with the sharp knife of
the plowshare, the planting done slowly and painstakingly by
hand. Crops were pitifully meager for all the hard work. Rains
held off. In spite of the great snows of the winter, the skies
gave only sparingly of moisture. Wood from the river's bank must
be cut for fuel. New trees must be planted to replace the inroads
being made upon the timber-land along the stream. Cottonwood
slips were brought to the cabins and planted in long rows to the
north for windbreaks. Elm and ash were set near the cabins for
potential shade. A shipment of apple and cherry trees was sent
out from Illinois and arriving at Omaha was brought on the Union
Pacific, completed in 1869. Adolph Kratz and Ludwig Rhodenbach
drove an ox team the long miles to a junction to get the saplings
for the eleven orchards.</p>
<p>Each man helped the others. Yet this was no communistic
colony,--each family fought its own battles, assisted always by
the others when occasion arose.</p>
<p>There was eternal vigilance on account of Indians. Sometimes
wandering bands came through, begged food and if it were not
forthcoming quickly, took it without leave.</p>
<p>There was eternal warfare with the elements,--great snows
isolated the cabins so that roads must be broken in order to get
through. Cold brought disaster to domestic animals and fowl, so
that sheds and barns must be packed tightly with timbers and sod.
Heat brought death to priceless horses and spring rains brought
floods to the lowlands. It took great physical strength and a
knack for careful planning to conquer this Nebraska into which
these eleven families of settlers had come. But the German
Gebhardts and Kratzes and Schaffers and all the others had them
both.</p>
<p>The Annas and the Lenas and the Amalias must do their
part,--wash and iron, cook and bake, leach the lye and make the
soap, pick the wild fruit,--gooseberry, plum and currant,--patch
and sew, work in the gardens, drop the corn, pick up potatoes,
and yet bring forth the children who were to carry on the work
when these mothers would be gone.</p>
<p>Always the prairie loomed there before them, lonely with
silence,--a sullen giant waiting to trap them with blizzard or
windstorm, drouth or flood, redskins or red fire.</p>
<p>It was five years now since the wagons, hub-deep in the
prairie grass, had stopped at the bend of the river.</p>
<p>Little Emil was nearly four, sturdy and round of face, his
hard cheeks apple-red and his hands square and harsh-skinned in
the palms as though even now they were fitting themselves for the
plow. All Amalia's love was for him.</p>
<p>The world would move from season to season that she and Herman
might wrest a living from the soil for this child. The sun would
come up each day that little Emil might grow strong in its rays.
The night would descend that sleep could restore energy to the
tired muscles.</p>
<p>Already Amalia's plans were laid that he was to be a
<i>pastor.</i> School, confirmation, more schooling,
ordination,--she pictured him grown and well known all over this
part of the new state. He should be fine and large,--clean and
well dressed,--learned and respected.</p>
<p>She pictured him in black suit and snowy white collar going
about his pastoral duties,--in fine robe in the high pulpit
delivering his sermons robustly after the manner of her church.
Long before that time there would be a pastoral house--a
<i>Pfarrhaus,</i>--by the side of the church on the knoll in the
Kratzes' pasture. Perhaps Emil would come there for his
pastorate. He would marry. But whom? Not Anna Kratz's Elsa nor
Lena Schaffer's sturdy little Christine. Some beautiful girl from
the cities where he would attend school.</p>
<p>"Lena, I want you should meet Emil's wife." Or: "Little dove"
(Emil would call her <i>"kleine Taube"),</i> "this is my mother's
old friend, Mrs. Anna Kratz."</p>
<p>Oh, it was a pleasant picture,--with Emil handsome and finely
dressed and so learned, saying: "I am all of this because of my
mother."</p>
<p>It was her life now. No longer was it necessary to creep away
into a Room for comfort. Her solace was here before her, running
about, sturdy and brave, with hard apple cheeks and eyes as blue
as her own.</p>
<p>Once she ventured to speak of her dreams to Herman.</p>
<p>He looked at her with but dull understanding. "There are no
pastors among the Holmsdorfers. We are all for the land."</p>
<p>Apparently it settled matters in Herman's eyes, but it did not
settle them in Amalia's deep blue ones. He spoke of the boy as
his, she thought, and felt vaguely that it was not true--that he
was hers only.</p>
<p>It was the sixth fall for the settlers,--a mild September
afternoon with the air hazy in the distance and a wind from the
south.</p>
<p>Herman was over at the Stoltz place helping Wilhelm and Fritz
who was twenty now and would soon want to be pushing on to find a
suitable homestead of his own.</p>
<p>Amalia was ironing,--hot and ready to drop from fatigue and
the heat of the wood-stove into which her irons were set. Always
she was sniffing this afternoon, she told herself,--somewhere
about her stove there was a faint odor of burning as though a bit
of the ash wood was on a griddle. She went all over the top of it
with her stove-cloth once more in order to dislodge the piece,
but the odor did not stop.</p>
<p>She went to the cabin door, then, with a double purpose,--to
keep an ever watchful eye on little Emil and to see if the faint
odor of burning could be located outside.</p>
<p>Once there, she raised her head and drew in a breath from the
hot prairie. The smell was outside, somewhere, of that she was
sure. The air seemed more hazy, and there was without doubt, now,
a far-off telltale odor of smoke.</p>
<p>She had not even time to come to any conclusion concerning it
until she could see Herman driving rapidly toward home, the
lumber-wagon rattling loudly because of careening about over the
rough ground.</p>
<p>Frightened at the combination of the smoke smell and Herman
driving home so rapidly, she ran out and called Emil.</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>Once he had done so mischievously to frighten her,--made no
answer and was hiding behind the oat straw. It had given her such
a scare that she had paddled him soundly for his lark. The river,
rattlesnakes, Indians,--for these must Emil never leave the
immediate ground around the cabin.</p>
<p>But now he was not at the straw stack nor by the log stable
nor under the young orchard trees.</p>
<p>Something frightening possessed her,--the smoke odor, the
haste of the rattling lumber-wagon, Emil not answering. She was
running wildly now, calling here, there, everywhere. On two sides
lay the wide open prairie, on one side the dried cornstalks
rustling in the hot stiff wind, on the other the timber-land and
the river.</p>
<p>Herman was here now, his horses lathering with the heat of
their coming.</p>
<p>"Get gunny-sacks," he called. "A prairie-fire."</p>
<p>So there was a prairie-fire coming and little Emil not
here.</p>
<p>It took all her strength to say the words and when they came,
they seemed not effective: "The baby . . . he is gone."</p>
<p>"Gone?"</p>
<p>"Lost from me."</p>
<p>"Well, then, find him." Herman yelled at her: "Find him before
he burns in the prairie-fire."</p>
<p>Fritz was speeding past now across the prairie to the
Kratzes'. Years later there would be a bell at the church tower
to ring for emergencies, but not yet. To-day must the words be
passed by Fritz on horseback.</p>
<p>It did not seem possible that <i>Gott</i> would let two
catastrophes happen at once,--so did Amalia childishly reason.
And so did she call on Him constantly to help her as she ran like
a wild woman first toward the cornfield, "Emil . . . baby. Answer
mother."</p>
<p>But there was no sound.</p>
<p>Back she sped for another look near the cabin, then down
toward the timber and the river: "<i>Emil . . . Liebling! Ach,
Gott."</i></p>
<p>Up and down the river bank she ran, calling frantically, then
back to the house, her hair down from its neat braid and flying,
her skirt catching on the corner of a wagon-box and tearing its
full length.</p>
<p>She could see the low black roll of the smoke now and the air
was putrid with the distant burning. Herman was plowing and so
was her father. Down in the other direction she could see the
Kratz men out too, plowing the strip so that the upturned loam
would give the fire nothing upon which to feed and it would die
out of hunger for something to consume.</p>
<p>What if the baby were out as far as the plowed strip? Perhaps
he had walked even beyond that point and already was between it
and the fire. When the blaze rolled in it would bring coyotes
running ahead of it and rattlesnakes hissing before it.</p>
<p>And now, calling and running, she had no plan for
looking,--was too distracted to hold sane ideas. Fritz was back.
The low-running black smoke showed its scarlet flame now like a
great black dog, mad and frothing at the mouth, snapping and
licking the ground with its slavering scarlet tongue.</p>
<p>She ran toward Fritz and the Kratzes and Herman, calling and
shrieking and ready to go out beyond the plowed strip and meet
the oncoming red thing if her baby were there too.</p>
<p>Fritz and Herman left the plowing to the Kratzes and came to
help hunt. The women were coming up now with wet gunny-sacks
ready for beating out any firebrands that might leap the plowed
strip when the red menace came near. The thing would not leap the
river but it might take all their cabins before reaching the
water that was on the north.</p>
<p>Women were hunting now, too,--Lena Schaffer and Anna Kratz,
their faces as white as Amalia's chalky one.</p>
<p>"His wagon," Fritz asked, "where is that?"</p>
<p>The wagon was not there. Fritz had made it from timber with
round disks cut from a young cottonwood for wheels.</p>
<p>"Where is the wagon, there is the baby," Fritz said and Amalia
agreed more sanely.</p>
<p>And it was Fritz who found him. Riding into the cornfield,
systematically up and down, so no portion would be missed, he
came upon him sleeping by his wagon,--three stubby ears of corn
in the little box of it. When Fritz lifted him up, he said
sturdily between yawns: "All the corn for winter I husk."</p>
<p>Not even Herman's cross: "See to it you look after him again,"
could hurt Amalia. She was beyond being hurt when her baby was
back in her arms. There was no fear anywhere now but the low
sweeping red flame licking closer to the farm land,--as horrible
as it was, the finding of Emil had minimized it.</p>
<p>All the rest of the afternoon they worked with plow and wet
gunny-sacks. As the firebrands lighted in the dry grass, Amalia
beat them like a strong man, for her relief and thankfulness gave
her strength.</p>
<p>When the last of the flames died down, the land to the south
was a desolate waste, leaving a fear forever branded on the minds
of the settlers as marked as the blackness of the scar on the
prairie.</p>
<p>Fall came on and the land was mellow with the haze of Indian
summer. Amalia cared for little Emil, washed and ironed, baked
her <i>frisches Kornbrot</i> and her <i>Kaffeekuchen,</i> cleaned
and scrubbed, took care of the meat from the hog that Herman
butchered, made <i>Metwurst</i> and smoked the <i>Schinken</i>
and rendered her lard.</p>
<p>Winter came on and the cabin was isolated in a sea of white so
that Herman broke a road to Anna Kratz's and to the church on the
knoll against which the drifts packed. There were Christmas
services with the singing of <i>"Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht"</i>
and <i>"Ein Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott,"</i> and with little Emil
big-eyed at the sight of the green <i>Tannenbaum</i> and the
home-made <i>Kerzen</i> lighted among its branches.</p>
<p>All winter Amalia hoarded every bit of grease from every rind
for the making of her soap. She made her own lye for it, too,
leaching the alkali from the wood ashes which she saved all
winter long.</p>
<p>When the first spring days came over the prairie bringing the
scent of wild things growing and the sound of wild things calling
to their mates, she would get out the big iron kettle which
Matthias had molded so carefully, and prepare for the soap
making.</p>
<p>The odor of the grease and lye was not distasteful to her. It
smelled good and clean like the wild free winds that blew over
the prairie. And though to herself she seemed like another Amalia
than the young girl in Illinois, an Amalia who knew nothing but
work and responsibility,--and though it was rather like a song
that is half remembered,--yet springtime and soap-time and the
lilt of the first meadow-lark brought back to her always the
poignant memory of lost love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c16" id="c16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Matthias Meier was now, in 1872, part and parcel of the new
capital town of Lincoln which like a growing youngster gained in
size and importance a little every day. There had been a vast
change since that April day four years before when he had driven
into the settlement of a few log-cabins. In truth, the village
was no longer isolated and aloof from the older towns. The
Burlington Railroad had arrived in 1870 from Plattsmouth and the
Midland Pacific a year later from Nebraska City. Stage coaches
were passé. And no longer did Charlie Briggs, through blizzard
and scorching heat, freight goods by team from Council Bluffs and
Pacific Junction, Iowa. In fact, Charlie had nearly lost his life
a few years before,--1869,--with a bunch of frontiersmen and
scouts in the Republican Valley. He had been one of fifty-one men
standing off the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Sioux Indians for nine
days from a sand-bank in the river. It made Matthias' blood run
cold when Charlie came to the store one day and told him some of
the bloody details.</p>
<p>There were a dozen or more stores dotted here and there on the
straggling streets. Several doctors' shingles swung in the
prairie winds and, while lawyers had not descended upon the town
in hordes quite equal to the grasshopper scourge, at least a
score of them had arrived.</p>
<p>There were a lunatic asylum and a penitentiary and a cemetery,
all appropriated by the state legislature,--the cemetery called
suitably enough <i>Wyuka</i> which is the Indian word for "a
place to lie down and sleep." The appropriation of this last
showed tremendous optimism on the part of the legislature for it
contained no less than one hundred acres, and how can enough
people to fill one hundred acres ever lie down and sleep there
unless they have first been awake nearby?</p>
<p>The capitol itself had been hastily constructed previous to
this with lumber brought in from Iowa and stone hauled from
Nebraska City and Plattsmouth, by the tedious team or ox-cart
method. It was built on high ground to the east of the village, a
cumbersome-looking affair, top-heavy with dome. Paths cut
diagonally across the meadow toward it where it stood in solitary
grandeur, a miniature Rome with all roads leading to it. The
grounds surrounding it were treeless virgin prairie on which the
cows of the neighborhood munched the early spring grasses.</p>
<p>But there was no doubt about the growth of the village. Almost
could one see the added poundage each month which the growing
youngster took on.</p>
<p><i>Meier's and Collins' Emporium</i> was selling high boots
and nearly-as-high shoes, New Orleans molasses and sugar, red
flannel and cotton batting, coffee berries, pepper, one or two
sizes of rope, two or three kinds of nails, shot and powder,
tobacco, goods by the yard running largely to calico, eggs and
butter, sometimes slightly the worse for their long jolting trips
across the prairie,--but who was there to find fault when there
were not any better anywhere?</p>
<p>There were two banks now, the State National and the First
National. Ten church organizations had been formed, sometimes
with but a mere handful of people in one, but as always, the
differences of close and open communion, of dipping and
sprinkling, of formal ritual or personal testimony, of conversion
in one lightning-like stroke or by the slow process of character
building, of foreordination or local option, as it were, drove
each citizen of the village to seek his own mode of religious
expression, however small the group.</p>
<p>There was a University,--a single building,--classrooms on the
first floor and a dormitory above, which like the capitol stood
in solitary grandeur on the prairie, and toward which the cows
also gravitated as though the grass there might benefit from its
proximity to an atmosphere of higher education.</p>
<p>Matthias was energetic, purposeful, one with the neighborly
spirit of the little town. He wore a beard,--it gave him added
dignity and apparently a few extra years. Twenty-seven he was
now,--his partner, James Collins, was twenty-five. Young men were
the order of the day.</p>
<p>So busy was Matthias with his store, so ambitious, that he
worked early and late, living, in the few hours he was away from
it, at a Mrs. Smith's boarding-house with several others of the
young business men, where came also some of the legislators in
season.</p>
<p>He attended church every Sunday morning in a frame and
somewhat flimsy building, and if he had two reasons for
going,--one to benefit his soul and the other his business, it
has been done before.</p>
<p>His association with young women had been as businesslike as
he could keep it, for since his love for Amalia had received its
blow, he felt no great desire to form another attachment. Already
he was being spoken of by the young women in town as an old
bachelor, but an eligible one for all that. Nor was he any martyr
to a lost love. He merely put his heart and energies into
<i>Meier's and Collin's Emporium.</i> Business was his mistress,
getting ahead his whole desire. If he no longer thought about
Amalia, at least he looked upon no other girl with longings.</p>
<p>He found to his own surprise that he was supposed to be the
possessor of a very decent voice. The songs in his head which he
had often told himself he could hear so plainly, suddenly proved
to be quite capable of arriving in the atmosphere with no little
degree of accuracy. At the occasional parties he attended his
"Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes" and "Come Where My Love Lies
Sleeping" joined in right nobly with those of the Lunds and the
McCurdeys who attended the same church.</p>
<p>It did not take long until Mrs. William McCurdey had inveigled
Matthias into the choir of which she was both voluntary soprano
and self-appointed leader. The rest of the personnel of the choir
included Mr. William McCurdey whose "Rocked in the Cradle of the
Deep" reached such utter basso profundo depths after its
prolonged descension that half the audience, when hearing it at a
home-talent concert, inadvertently put hands to their throats in
a sort of mesmerized sympathy of aching muscles.</p>
<p>The tenor was Mr. Anton Lund whose tossing head, rapidly
winking eyes and mouth gymnastics supplied entertainment for any
deficiencies which his voice might lack, and whose whole facial
effect was such that little boys and girls otherwise bored with
the services looked forward each Sunday to this particular
amusement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Anton Lund was a member of the choir merely because she
was Mrs. Anton Lund,--it being apparent to all that she neither
added to nor took away from the musical output, her faint little
voice never attaining to greater volume than that made by a
rabbit nibbling grass. The alto was Miss Dolly Thomas, a good,
substantial robust alto, who made up for Mrs. Anton Lund's lack
of volume by a full, unshaded, monotonously accurate second part
as resonant as a bell.</p>
<p>In this fall of 1872, now, Mrs. McCurdey became filled with
zeal to add Matthias, some other as yet undiscovered tenor, and
another soprano to the choir. Almost in answer to her prayers, a
Miss Ida Carter arrived to open a private school, bringing with
her a sweet soprano voice which Mrs. McCurdey immediately
requisitioned. After some sleuthing she found one Peter
Longshore, a drug clerk, fairly capable of following Mr. McCurdey
part way down into the cradle of the deep. These then became the
double quartette of the church to which they went long and often
for practice, the meetings taking upon themselves more and more
of the social side as time went on.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lunds took Ida Carter, the new teacher, home.
Sometimes the McCurdeys took her. Sometimes Peter Longshore and
Miss Dolly Thomas. And then one night when the Lunds and the
McCurdeys were invited to eat oysters at the Atwood House right
after choir practice, and Miss Dolly Thomas and Mr. Peter
Longshore frankly disappeared while Matthias was gathering up his
music, it devolved upon him to take Miss Carter home himself.</p>
<p>Miss Carter was not pretty. She was merely clean and neat with
rather nice frank gray eyes, and having only a level head and a
sense of humor instead of any of the feminine appeal which
Matthias knew every man required.</p>
<p>He took her arm down the church steps and through the darkness
of the streets, realizing it gave him very little headiness of
feeling, a fact which genuinely relieved him. In truth, it gave
him such a sense of security that he was rather more courteous
and gallant all the way to her boarding-house than he would have
been otherwise, slipping protectingly to the inside of the walk
when they passed the saloon with its swinging doors and sour
yeasty smell.</p>
<p>He saw her into her boarding-house, talked for a moment in the
dim kerosene-lighted hallway with her landlady who had rushed out
to chaperon the two, bade Miss Carter a formal good-night and
departed to his own boarding-house.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at his room, for some reason which he could not
analyze, he went to the calfskin brass-bound box in which he kept
his papers and took out the leather wallet containing the note
from Amalia. He had not thought about her for a long time. She
was no longer his,--could never be his. But even so, the sight of
the note, the precise and shaded script it contained, gave him
more genuine stirring of the emotions than the warm human touch
of the young woman he had just left.</p>
<p>He read the letter through twice. It stirred him
unaccountably. A sudden wave of longing for her and regret swept
over him. He had not felt its like for years, and wondered
vaguely why he was experiencing it to-night. Dear, lovely little
Amalia! And this was all he had of her,--a fragile note. Not a
lock of hair nor a picture, not a flower. Just a note and
memories.</p>
<p>Almost as though in answer to the wish, for a moment, then,
she stepped out of the letter as plainly as anything short of
reality could have done.</p>
<p>Vividly he saw the pansy-blueness of her eyes and the pinkness
of her mouth, felt again the warm softness of her lips and supple
body.</p>
<p>Where was she now? Did she ever think of him? How had the
German husband . . . and the years . . . treated her? For the
hundredth time he asked himself why he had been late. Other
steamers made the trip in regulation time. Not once in two dozen
trips, perhaps, was one delayed so long. But the one he chose had
been caught and held grimly by the sands. They had proved to be
the sands of time. Why had it happened so? Why? For what reason?
What right had Fate to intervene between him and his heart's
deepest desire?</p>
<p>He looked again at the note, as though from its six years of
lying there in the darkness it might speak. And in speaking,
answer the unanswered question.</p>
<p>. . . <i>it is better to remember our love as it was in the
springtime.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c17" id="c17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>But even though Matthias looked upon Ida Carter only as a
nice, intelligent young woman with whom he had been thrown in
social and vocal contact, at the end of the next choir practice
evening, because she very frankly made plans to go home with the
McCurdeys to the utter disregard of the previous week's
procedure, he found himself really wanting to take her. There was
something mentally stimulating about her even though she was so
different from Amalia. And she had a sense of humor such as he
had never known in any feminine acquaintance,--the humor that
could laugh gaily at her own foibles and at his also, but without
barbed shafts.</p>
<p>So he took her "home" to the dimly-lighted but resolutely
chaperoned boarding-house that night,--and many others.</p>
<p>By Christmas time the walk home with her had grown to be the
regular program. By mid-winter he was calling upon her steadily
in the late Sunday afternoon and accompanying her to evening
church. By February it came to be a rather settled thing in the
intimate little social affairs of the growing town,--house
warmings, oyster suppers, the McCurdeys' tin wedding,--that
Matthias Meier was assigned by the hostess to Miss Ida
Carter.</p>
<p>He grew to look forward to their talks. She had such a grasp
of human understanding, could turn a subject over in her mind so
deftly with such reasonable decisions that she satisfied
something in him. He found himself reserving opinions until he
had learned her reaction, planning to tell her about problems
which came up in his business, even to ask advice outright
occasionally. Sometimes he questioned himself closely, tried to
analyze just what this type of friendship meant to him,--told
himself if this was love, it was a queer kind. There was none of
that thunder of blood in his ears he had once felt. He must wait
now and see how permanent was the feeling, remembering that when
he had loved Amalia there was no question, and no thought of
waiting.</p>
<p>So it was that on this Easter Sunday of 1873, a fine one with
every one dressed in his best and out on the high wooden
sidewalks of the main streets, with many buggies and two-seated
carriages tied at the hitching posts in front of the churches,
with Mr. Anton Lund's tenor soaring high and Mr. McCurdey's basso
profundo rumbling in the opposite direction, that some chemical
change took place in Matthias' heart and he warmed toward the
young woman sitting in front of him in the choir. He looked at
the pretty plum-colored straw hat with its plume hanging over the
brim and mingling with her dark hair, at the neat folds of her
high collar, and almost before he could question its reason he
told himself he was going to marry her.</p>
<p>From that moment on he was lost in a maze of planning. He
would build a new house not far from the capitol. He would branch
out in other lines of business investments as soon as possible.
The town would be twice this size some day. He would never care
to live anywhere else. He would always be proud of Ida. His
decision sent his mind skyrocketing on an hour of planning far
afield from the minister's message.</p>
<p>When the long sermon was over and the congregation poured out
on the wooden sidewalks, Matthias slipped his arm through that of
Miss Ida Carter, rather to her startled consternation, that
gesture being usually reserved for the period following
sundown.</p>
<p>With chattering people all about, with buggies pulling up to
the edge of the walk near them, and children with Sunday School
papers brushing hurriedly past, he said it, as though the saying
could not wait, now that he had decided.</p>
<p>"Ida, I want you to be my wife." Now that he had taken the
step he found there should never have been any question about
it.</p>
<p>No moonlight, no music, no chance for romance. Ida merely
saying: "Why, Matt, I am so surprised at . . . How do you do,
Mrs. Jamison. Of course I . . . Good morning, Alice. Yes, isn't
it nice? . . . If you think you really want me, Matt . . . Hello,
Mose."</p>
<p>In such a way did Matthias make his second proposal to a young
woman. And in such a way did she accept.</p>
<p>By night there had descended the Easter blizzard of 1873 which
still lives on the pages of midwestern diaries and in the annals
of its histories. It caught the people of Lincoln unaware as
indeed it caught those of the whole state. It caught Matthias
Meier at Mrs. Smith's boarding-house sitting on the horse-hair
sofa under the unseeing eye of Mrs. Smith's deceased and framed
husband but still within the range of Mrs. Smith's own alert,
far-sighted one, also framed, but by the crack of the door.</p>
<p>The blizzard gave Matthias a pleasant background for the
thought that soon he and this nice girl with her good sense and
humor would have a home of their own shut away from all the
blizzards of all time. So pleasing were his thoughts that he was
almost unaware of what Ida was saying. But now he heard it.</p>
<p>"Matt, I have something I must ask you. I hate myself for
thinking about it, but it seems that if I'll face facts and tell
you,--get your honest answer I can conquer the feeling I've been
working myself into this afternoon. Has there ever been any other
girl, Matt, or am I the first and only girl you have loved?"</p>
<p>He sparred for time. "How can I answer? The way you put your
question, Ida, calls for both yes, and no." He laughed a bit as
though the whole thing were a joke.</p>
<p>Ida laughed, too,--at herself. "I knew it, of course. There
has been. It seems that I can almost sense what you're thinking
at times, I have learned to know you so well. Well, I brought it
on myself and I've nobody but myself to blame. I wonder why I had
to torture myself by knowing? I suppose I'd be far happier if I
didn't know all the details to mull over in my mind, but tell me,
anyway, Matt. I imagine things like a youngster in the dark.
Maybe if you'd light the lamp . . . the bogies would turn out to
be shadows."</p>
<p>"There's not much to tell, Ida dear." And because seven years
is a long time to a young man, he said: "It was years ago. I was
only twenty-one and she was not quite eighteen. It was in
Illinois that I knew her. Something . . . parted us. I never saw
her again. I don't even know just where she lives, although it's
somewhere out here in this state . . . away out farther on the
prairie. She's married . . . and come to think about it, I don't
even know her married name." He was smiling at the nice girl
sitting by him on the boarding-house sofa, slipping his arm about
her now. "Pretty dangerous rival, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Ida smiled at that, too. It <i>had</i> been silly to punch
sleeping dogs. But it was a newly engaged girl's prerogative.</p>
<p>Matthias and Ida did not go to church. No one went to church
or anywhere else. The storm raged like an infuriated madman. The
room grew cold so that Matthias kept feeding chunks of wood into
the sheet-iron stove, not knowing that Mrs. Smith was counting
every one.</p>
<p>He stayed all evening as the storm continued its fury. Indeed,
so terrible was its raging that he stayed all night, a fact that
caused Mrs. Smith so much perturbation that after giving him her
own room, she made a bed for herself on a couch in the hall in
sight of Miss Carter's door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c18" id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Easter had come to the valley, too.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that hitherto the winters had been
severe, the seventh one for the settlers, that of 1872 and '73
was unusually fine,--practically an open one with little or no
snow. Not once had Amalia missed church, nor had she been forced
to stay away from Anna Kratz's for two months at a time as in
some of those past seasons.</p>
<p>Almost every other week she had taken Emil to Anna's and spent
the afternoon piecing her quilt,--Anna returning the visit the
next week. Sometimes she had to walk when Herman was busy or
angry about something that had gone wrong with the stock or his
tools or the feed. Then he would storm and rage and Amalia would
go quietly about her work until he had slammed his way out of the
cabin and down to the stable, when she would slip out and trudge
the long way over to Anna's.</p>
<p>It would soon be seven years since she and Anna had been
married the same day by the side of the Cut-off trail near
Nebraska City. Anna had her fourth child this week,--three boys
and a girl now.</p>
<p>Only this Easter morning on the way home from Confirmation
services in the log church on the knoll Herman had thrown it up
to her, saying that Adolph would have help a plenty in a few
years and how could one expect to get ahead and have more land
with just one son to work it with him.</p>
<p>Amalia, feeling bold, had said: "Emil will not be working the
land when a pastor he is to be."</p>
<p>It had set Herman off. Even though it was Easter Sunday and he
had sung lustily with the others <i>"O Du Fröliche, O Du
Selige,"</i> already on the way home he was talking of
land,--always talking more land and that Emil should hurry and
grow up to help work it, and was now in a rage that she was
suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p>"The Holmsdorfers have always been for the land."</p>
<p>"My mother was from a pastor's family," Amalia said. "Her
father and her grandfather in Germany were well educated and were
pastors."</p>
<p>"Let others do the preaching," Herman struck at the horses in
his anger so the wagon bounced over the rutty prairie trail.
<i>"My</i> son works."</p>
<p>At home Amalia changed her dress to her everyday one, built up
her fire and prepared her dinner. Wilhelm and Fritz came as
always to have the Sunday meal with them. Sometimes several
families took dinner together,--once in a while all eleven of
them.</p>
<p>The door of the cabin stood open for the day was almost hot
with a strong wind from the south. Amalia had worn her straw
bonnet--of the fashion of many years ago--to church, so
summer-like had it been. For several weeks men had been working
in the fields. Only Saturday Herman had plowed all day in his
shirt sleeves. Every indication of winter had vanished.</p>
<p>"Everything is getting green," Herman said to the men when he
had finished the <i>Tischgebet.</i></p>
<p>Herman made the table prayer no matter what his mood.
Sometimes when scolding loudly, he would stop suddenly, make the
<i>Tischgebet:</i></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Komm Herr Yesu, sei unser Gast und segne was Du
uns bescheret hast."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>And even though he had said this: "Come, Lord Jesus, be our
Guest and bless what Thou hast prepared for us," at the
<i>"Amen"</i> he would be raising his head and continuing the
loud fault-finding as though nothing had intervened, as though he
had never prayed the table prayer.</p>
<p>"Yes. Green and pretty," Amalia added. She was glad he was so
safely over his anger of the morning.</p>
<p>"Of the pretty we do not care," he snapped. "It is the green
for crops we need."</p>
<p>Amalia looked at her plate and said nothing. To Herman there
was no need to speak ever of the prettiness of things. Why did
she ever do it when she knew he did not care? But to little
Emil--that was different. Always she called his attention to the
red at the edge of the sunset clouds and the light on the prairie
like lakes of gold. He was to be a <i>pastor</i> and he must see
the beautiful along with the ugly burdens. He must sense the
presence of God in every leaf and wild flower. It would help him
in his work.</p>
<p>The meal went on, a mere consuming of food and talk of the
land and the mares they were buying.</p>
<p>Herman and Wilhelm were leaving right after dinner for one of
the Englishmen's homesteads, that of Mr. Lawrence, about seven
miles away. "Together we can manage the mares we are to bring,"
they decided.</p>
<p>"Fritz does not go?"</p>
<p><i>"Nein.</i> If we are late he does the chores for both."</p>
<p>By two o'clock, with the men gone, shifting clouds scudded low
across the blue of the spring sky. A little later when
surprisingly a slow drizzling sprinkle began, Amalia tied a shawl
over her head, put a jacket on Emil and together they went out
for eggs.</p>
<p>"So early it is for the eggs," she explained to him, "but
later it will rain harder."</p>
<p>Emil was five now, sturdy and strong, his round apple-cheeked
face a miniature Herman's. He grasped the basket interwoven with
its carpet rags and swung along ahead of Amalia on big stocky
legs, calling back German sentences. "I can myself the eggs
hunt," and fiercely: "The old hens will I scare."</p>
<p>They gathered the eggs at the straw-stack, Amalia calling out
warnings not to go so high, or not go so close to the cow; with
Emil, proudly brave, doing the very things of which <i>Mutter</i>
was fearful.</p>
<p>While they were hunting around the stack down toward the
creek-bed where an old hen often stole her nest, the skies grew
darker and a chill wind blew in from the northwest. By the time
they were in the house rain was falling almost sleet-like in its
harshness.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chilling rain, Fritz arrived to do the
chores, explaining that he was doing Herman's first and their own
later. He wished his father and Herman would get in. "Almost I
would say we would have a blizzard if the season was not so
late."</p>
<p>When he had finished and gone back home, the clouds grew very
black and hung low with a menacing appearance. Amalia watched
them from the cabin's small window. The rain turned in truth then
to sleet,--then to snow so fine and thick that Amalia could no
longer see out of the window. She kept up the fire with the wood
from the creek-bed, put Emil to bed very early and sat down close
to the stove to wait.</p>
<p>It was a blizzard by now.</p>
<p>She could hear the wild winds of it shrieking about the cabin,
feel its blasts shaking the little structure as though the great
breath of some insane giant were trying to blow it over. The men
folks would not have left the homestead of the Lawrences', of
that she was certain. The rain had turned to sleet so early in
the afternoon that they would not have started on the long trek
across the open prairie.</p>
<p>She crawled into bed beside the sleeping Emil, his rosy face
close to hers, and though she said her prayers to the good
<i>Gott</i> for safety, she shivered with fright whenever the
roaring wind shook the cabin. Toward morning she slept,--and
because she had been awake so long in the early part of the
night, overslept, realizing it when she came to herself with a
start.</p>
<p>Sitting up quickly, she had the sensation of a peculiar
whiteness about her, as of a strange fantastic light. Everything
was white,--the bed blankets were covered with a white powdered
snow,--the small window of the cabin was packed solid with
it.</p>
<p>Hastily she dressed and leaving Emil sleeping, went out into
the coldness of the other room. With freezing fingers she made a
fire in the little stove and as its flame tore madly with the
wind into the chimney, fearful of setting the cabin on fire,
wished she had not done so.</p>
<p>With Herman caught away from home at the Lawrences', she must
feed the stock. So she bundled herself in an old coat of his,
tied a scarf tightly over her hair and prepared to plunge into
the storm.</p>
<p>As she opened the door the fury of the thing was overwhelming.
It rushed into the room like a white mad animal. The air itself
appeared to be one huge mass of moist and moving snow. The wind
howled like so many hungry coyotes.</p>
<p>She stepped out into the welter, scarcely able to pull the
door against the fury of the thing, and sank to her hips in a
moist and smothering snowbank. Some instinct made her keep one
hand tightly clasped to the cabin door-latch. She held the other
mittened one up now to her face and could not see its
outline.</p>
<p>For a time she stood there, buffeted, hip deep in the drift,
not knowing what to do. But Fritz could not get through this
welter from his place she was sure. The stock in the barn needed
her,--there were two cows to be milked . . . and the chickens to
be fed.</p>
<p>A blast of wind, wilder than the preceding ones, tore the
shawl from her head and, unthinking, she let go of the doorlatch
to grab for the flying headgear. Immediately she was down in the
snowbank gasping for breath like a drowning thing. Frantically
she reached back for the door and met only the emptiness of the
snow-packed air.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c19" id="c19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>"I am not four feet from the house," Amalia said to herself,
frantic at feeling nothing but the snow-filled air. "It must be
here . . . or here . . . or there. . . ."</p>
<p>But it was not there. It was as though the house had vanished,
leaving her in a welter of flying, whirling clouds of snow. Arms
out, she staggered frantically, her eyes and mouth and nostrils
filled with the smothering thing. One thought only possessed her,
as it has possessed good mothers always,--her child. She must get
to little Emil, alone in the cabin, sleeping there in his
bed.</p>
<p>She wallowed, fell, picked herself from the great drifts and
staggered about. Frantic, she lunged first in one direction and
then another. And then . . . the wall! The good solid wall
hitting her suddenly from out a sea of emptiness. <i>Gott sei
dank.</i> And God be thanked for trees and logs and shelter from
the wild elements.</p>
<p>She clung with mittened freezing fingers to the chinks between
the logs until she might regain her breath. This way lay the
stoop and door. She moved cautiously along, never taking her
hands from the wall. When she felt snow piled shoulder-high
against the solid thing, she would not remove her hold, but
fought the white moist mass with her other hand and shoulders.
And it seemed that she would never be able to work herself
through the dense mountain. It was so smothering . . . so . .
.</p>
<p>She was through. But strangely, here was a corner of the
house. How could there be a corner? She must have hit the cabin
on the narrow side that first time she had found it in a sea of
snow,--shuddered to think she might have missed it entirely.</p>
<p>And now there was this other side to be traversed. It seemed
hours that she fought her way through, clinging always to the
logs lest for one instant she lose their feel.</p>
<p>And then she stumbled, and the thing that had caused her to
stumble was the stoop. With numb hands she clung, worked them
slowly up through the hard-packed mass, not seeing, doing all by
sense of touch. The latch! With one last exertion of her body she
flung herself onto the latch,--into the room,--pushed the door
back against the mad white giant, drunk with the power of his
strength, trying to follow her into the house.</p>
<p>She must have fainted, for when she knew what was next
happening, Emil in his flannel nightgown was bending over her,
pulling at her eyelids, calling <i>"Mutter"</i>--and she was down
on the floor in a slushy bed of snow that had dropped from her
garments.</p>
<p>All day and all night the storm raged. Wild white fingers
plucked at the little cabin standing lonely on the prairie, a
continent away from the other cabins on the adjoining homesteads,
as far away from Fritz in his log house on the next acreage as
though a sea separated them. Indeed, it was an ocean that parted
them, with snowdrifts for water and Death riding the waves.</p>
<p>All day and all night with the snow blowing under the door and
seeping in through every crack, Amalia tried to make her supply
of wood last. In the afternoon of the second day she went to bed
with Emil clasped in her arms, both fully dressed, and with the
quilts wrapped about them. If only they could have foreseen how
bad it was to be, Fritz would have stayed here with them for
safety and for company. Many times she thought of her father and
Herman, thankful that the blizzard must have come on before they
started home.</p>
<p>On the third day the storm abated, and the sun came out upon a
world devoid of color. White everywhere,--nothing but a sparkling
white world and a blue sky, as though an inverted blue china bowl
met the rim of a white plate.</p>
<p>Fritz, after nearly a half-day's work through the drifts,
managed to get to Amalia. He told her tales she could scarcely
believe,--his horses had stamped so much snow under their hoofs
that their backs were near the shed roof. Frozen prairie chickens
were everywhere and a deer lay dead between the house and the
barn. The trees along the river banks were not visible,--only a
great solid white wall traced the way of the stream.</p>
<p>Out at the stable he found a horse nearly embedded in snow,
frozen chickens, a calf almost lifeless so that he brought it
into the house, much to Emil's excited delight.</p>
<p>He agreed verbally with Amalia that the storm would have
struck before the menfolks started home, but each knew the other
in his heart was not entirely confident.</p>
<p>All day and part of the next Amalia waited to hear from the
two men.</p>
<p>And then Ludwick Rhodenbach and August Schaffer found Wilhelm
Stoltz lying against the wagon-box which he had turned on its
side to protect himself from the onslaught of the storm. He was
unconscious, his feet frozen stiff.</p>
<p>They took him home. When he gained consciousness and could
talk, he said he did not know where Herman was,--that he had set
out across the prairie for Rudolph Kratz's house. Later a doctor
came on horseback across the prairie from the far-away new town
of Westville, and amputated Wilhelm's feet,--the feet that had
walked with unceasing energy beside the ox-cart all the way from
Illinois.</p>
<p>The snows began to melt under the April sun and the river
rose. Every hollow and ravine that ran in an easterly or westerly
direction was filled with snow from rim to rim. Shacks had been
unroofed and people in them frozen. Travelers caught out in the
wild onslaught were found when the drifts melted weeks
afterward.</p>
<p>The Kratzes out hunting for their horses came across the dead
body of Herman. It was at the head of a small canyon pocket, his
gun by his side. Evidently he had died on his knees having
crawled into the narrow place to get such slight protection from
the cold as its walls would afford.</p>
<p>They brought him home to Amalia.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rudolph Kratz and Anna came ahead to tell her. They
wanted to break it gently. As though Death is ever gentle.</p>
<p>But when Anna saw Amalia standing at the stove cooking
<i>Suppe</i> for her sick father and thought how the two couples
were married the same day so romantically outdoors by the side of
the trail, and how she would feel if it were Adolph, she threw
her apron over her head, burst into wild weeping, and could not
tell.</p>
<p>So the older Mrs. Rudolph Kratz said it bluntly: "Amalia, you
have lost your Herman. They find him dead."</p>
<p>Amalia stood as one paralyzed and yet wondering sanely how one
can lose something one has never had.</p>
<p>In the days that followed she could not sense what was
happening. It was too strange. She moved in and out of the cabin
and went over to her father's bedside while Mrs. Rudolph Kratz
and old Augusta Schaffer bathed that which had been Herman and
dressed it in its black suit.</p>
<p>She shed no tears, and for that they whispered among
themselves that she would go crazy if she did not cry.</p>
<p>The neighbors brought <i>Metwurst</i> and <i>Kuchen</i> and
all their children, set the table and ate a great deal and talked
of Herman,--how good he was at turning the new sod and breaking
colts and how mad he would have been to know the two mares he had
already paid good money for, froze to death on the way home.</p>
<p>Amalia let Mrs. Kratz and Augusta Schaffer swathe a great
black veil around her head that made her feel suffocated and from
which she asked frantically to be let out at once, for behind its
thickness it seemed that she was in blinding black snow and could
not breathe nor find little Emil.</p>
<p>Herman was buried while Wilhelm still lay hurling his huge
bulk against the wall in the throes of death.</p>
<p>With the prairie soggy from the melting snows and the teams of
the settlers hitched all around the log church on the hill,
Amalia sat through the long services for Herman, and saw him
lowered under the sod that he had known so deftly how to break.
And now some one else had broken a little patch of prairie sod
for Herman. Who was Herman? A man whose house she had kept and
whose bread she had baked and by whose side . . .</p>
<p>And then she thought of little Emil, whose hand she held so
tightly, and suddenly burst into wild sobbing.</p>
<p>At that all the women in their black funeral clothes pursed
their lips and nodded solemnly to each other across the soggy
pile of dirt. She was now all right, having passed the tearless
stage. Now she would not go crazy. She had cared so much for her
man she had been on the way to going insane. <i>Verrückt.</i></p>
<p>But Amalia was not crying for having thought so much of her
man. For herself she was like a stone,--she had no feeling. She
was crying because every little boy ought to have a father, and
now her little boy had none.</p>
<p>Three days after Herman was buried, Amalia's father died,
too.</p>
<p>It was a hard death that old Wilhelm Stoltz had to meet, far
harder than Herman's painless sleeping in the snow,--gangrene
from the frozen feet, amputation, and after that a lingering and
terrible passing.</p>
<p>Never sick a day in his life, always his own master and
dictator of those about him, when he realized that he was not to
get well,--that, like Herman, he too could never again crack the
blacksnake, never break the new sod or plant or reap, never face
the wild winds of the prairie or buffet the storms,--he grew hard
and bitter and turned on the God whom he had addressed so
fervently and for whose worship he had come into the new land.
But at the last, with the fever consuming him, when he was worn
and spent with his ravings and knew that he must obey the
absolute Dictator, he grew meek and muttered humble
supplications.</p>
<p>But even then he could not leave his authoritative position
without a last strangle-hold upon the lives of his children. He
called Fritz to the bedside, bade him bring the big Bible.</p>
<p>"Put . . . your hand on it. A promise make me."</p>
<p>Fritz obeyed. He had always obeyed.</p>
<p>"You will never marry. To look after Amalia and little Emil
you will stay single."</p>
<p>Fritz swallowed hard. His bronze face paled. Twenty-two he
was, warm-blooded and ready for a wife. Already in the church
services he had cast longing eyes toward Minnie Rhodenbach, a
young widow with a small child. He could not speak out his mind
that it was cruel to expect such a promise. He could scarcely
have done so if his father were well. How could he, then, when
Death hovered over him?</p>
<p>"Before God . . . you promise?"</p>
<p>Fritz's tall lanky body shook as though he, too, felt the
coldness of the grave, and saw its darkness. This looking on at a
passing, it was a fearsome thing, at this Death that laid low the
two huge frames of his father and brother-in-law. He wet his dry
lips. "But if Amalia marries and has protection?" he
ventured.</p>
<p>"It releases you. But you will not tell her of your oath.
Promise."</p>
<p>Fritz turned frightened eyes toward the log church in the
distance as though he might there see the soft round face of
Minnie Rhodenbach with dimples at the mouth's corners.</p>
<p>"Promise." Wilhelm heaved himself fearfully on his elbow, his
deep-set eyes, glassy in death, piercing those of his son.
<i>"Gleich!"</i></p>
<p>"I promise."</p>
<p>They buried old Wilhelm, too,--not old,--but seeming so
because of the weather-beaten countenance and the huge gnarled
frame and his long years of hard work beginning in the German
mines when he was twelve.</p>
<p>There were four graves now on the high knoll of the church
acreage. Sometimes the fierce sun blazed down on them and the hot
southwest winds blew. Sometimes the tumble-weeds rolled over them
and the crows circled low. And sometimes the great prairie snows
piled high between the mounds.</p>
<p>But wind or sun or snows, it was very quiet out there where
Herman and old Wilhelm lay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c20" id="c20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the strange days that followed Herman's death and that of
her father, also, in the Easter blizzard, Amalia could not seem
to adjust herself to the new way of living. She appreciated the
kindness of all the families, knowing how little they had to give
from their meager supplies and seeing how generous they were in
their giving. For all of them came now bearing gifts to show
their sorrow to one who was never anything but kind to them and
gentle.</p>
<p>The women brought home-made <i>Käse</i> and wild
<i>Pflaumenbutter.</i> The men drove in to see about the stock
and corn-planting.</p>
<p>She thanked them all, but told them Fritz was going to move
over here with her, and bring their father's stock and equipment.
She and Fritz would get along fine. She even laughed at a little
joke she made that Fritz had always been her favorite brother,
when they knew she had only Fritz. Anna Kratz was ashamed for
Amalia that she had joked that way before the men, and Herman so
recently taken.</p>
<p>"But maybe Fritz wants a wife now and farm his father's place
for himself," Elsa Rhodenbach suggested, having been sent as a
sort of official spy by her sister Minnie.</p>
<p>But Amalia only laughed aloud at her,--twice to-day she had
laughed. "Fritz isn't looking around any yet."</p>
<p>She had a queer feeling of deception; that she was pretending
to be something she was not,--that she was two women, the real
Amalia and one who must act a part.</p>
<p>She had shed tears over the passing of Herman and her father,
and neither death had touched that which was away down inside her
being.</p>
<p>She had been shaken by the shock of both tragedies and the
awfulness of the presence of death in the house; but a few days
later something inside her had soared as at a release. She would
have been ashamed to have any of the women know it. From Anna
Kratz who mourned over her constantly because of the double
marriage and the closeness of their friendship, she must always
keep the knowledge. But it was true. She felt free without
Herman's loud orders and his clutching hands upon her, without
her father's constant commands and the fear of his opinions. Only
for little Emil was she sad. But she and Fritz would teach him to
mind them without fear. She and Fritz would be all that Herman
had been and more.</p>
<p>In the late summer she unwrapped the shell box which Matthias
had given her and left it openly for a few weeks on her walnut
bureau, so that all the feminine contingent of the Kratz and
Schaffer, the Gebhardt and Rhodenbach women might see and admire
and envy, but never know from whence it came.</p>
<p>Fritz, seeing it there with its shining Roman snails and
angel-wings, moon shells and fragile fan-shaped ones, said
suddenly:</p>
<p>"Amalia . . . you are a young widow. You are . . ." he was
embarrassed, ". . . are free."</p>
<p>She had thought of it too. She had known how wicked it was,
but how could she help it,--who had loved Matthias so?</p>
<p>"You would write . . . a letter, Amalia?" If poor Fritz was
thinking of Minnie Rhodenbach more than of Amalia,--no one knew
it, so who was there to chide?</p>
<p>Amalia shook her head. "Don't speak of it, Fritz. It is not
right . . . and seven years is too long. I would only hurt myself
to hear of his marriage."</p>
<p>So it came about that Fritz, his mind working a little slowly
perhaps, but with stubborn persistence, one day wrote the letter
himself, painstakingly, in the German, telling no one, and mailed
it to the iron foundry in Illinois.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c21" id="c21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Back in the growing town of Lincoln Ida Carter gave up her
private school in June. She and Matthias were to be married on
September 20th, the wedding to be at the McCurdeys', for the trip
back to her home in Massachusetts would have been long and
expensive. The two had now definitely come to another decision,
rather a queer one and with Matthias a long time in coming to see
it as Ida did,--she was going in the store with him. At first he
had thought it all wrong, later came to agree with her that a
woman's taste and intuitions might be a good thing in the
business.</p>
<p>"When we make our first fifty thousand dollars, I'll stop,"
she had said laughingly, so that Matthias laughed too at the huge
sum.</p>
<p>They were going to live at the boarding-house. "When we get to
making money and I stop the store work, we'll have a fine home,"
she told him.</p>
<p>All summer she was having her new dresses made, the making of
a dress taking far longer than the recent making of the new state
constitution, the latter not having pleats, panniers, and
panels.</p>
<p>The town to a man was interested in the coming event. Plans
were secretly under way for a charivari. Matthias had a new horse
and high buggy, and the sight of the two fine-looking young
people,--Ida with her gray dress and cape and small straw bonnet,
Matthias in his dark suit and high hat and with his black beard
trimmed in its neat square-cut style,--driving around the dusty
streets or through the splashing mud was a sign for much
attention from the sidewalk portion of the population.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCurdey was rather beside herself with importance, many
cakes to be baked, an elderberry drink to be made and saying
often: "Oh, if only there could be such a thing as plenty of ice
in the summer."</p>
<p>The invitations were to be mailed out the sixth of
September.</p>
<p>On the fifth Matthias received a letter from Fritz Stoltz sent
on to him by his uncle in Illinois.</p>
<p>He cut into it at the desk in the back part of the store, not
knowing whose stilted German-looking script was before him. When
he saw it was from Amalia's brother, he was as surprised as
amazed.</p>
<p>It was formally written, the penmanship painstakingly done as
by a small boy, although Matthias knew Fritz must be a young man
by now.</p>
<p>He read it slowly, carefully, his pulse beating rapidly at
this first word in all the seven years concerning the girl he had
so loved.</p>
<p>Amalia was a widow, the letter said,--the man she had married
because of her father's wishes had been frozen to death in the
Easter blizzard of last spring, and their father, too. Matthias
shuddered as he read it, remembering the fury of the storm the
night he had stayed at Ida's. He had read of many deaths out on
the prairie at that time. One of them, then, was Amalia's husband
and one her father, and he had not dreamed there was any one
frozen to death of whom he had ever heard.</p>
<p>Amalia was free now, Fritz said, but did not know he was
writing, would never know that he had done so. He could say that
he knew Amalia still loved Matthias although she had never said
it in so many words. When he had spoken to her about him, she had
said he was no doubt married by this time. If this was true, or
if Matthias had forgotten Amalia, he need never take the trouble
to answer. But it seemed only right and truthful to let him know
that Amalia was free.</p>
<p>Concluding the missive Matthias felt a combination of
emotions,--sadness for the cruelty of the girl's mismanaged life,
an irritation that the letter had come in just as the invitations
for his marriage were to go out, an annoyance that the brother
had written at all, but in spite of all this, a revival of love
for the little Amalia which would not down. The affair had been
as a book that was closed, or a song that was sung,--and now the
pages were fluttering open, a strain of the old music was in the
air.</p>
<p>All day he went about his business with the letter on his mind
and a mixed group of emotions within him. He listened to the
merry quips of friends who made bold to speak of the coming event
and was provoked that they had taken upon themselves the freedom
to do so. He was angry at Fritz for writing and angry that he had
not done so sooner.</p>
<p>It weighed so upon him that when he went to Ida's in the
evening, he was preoccupied, not himself. Ida, with her quick
intuition, caught the mood, asked him about it.</p>
<p>"If there's anything troubling you, Matt,--don't you think
it's a better way to begin our married life by talking it over?
If I'm wrong for asking, forgive me. It's only . . . that I care
. . . and want to help."</p>
<p>How good she was and capable and understanding. Suddenly he
wanted to tell her, to go to her as a boy would to his mother,
and let her know this upsetting thing which had happened.</p>
<p>He showed her, then, the letter, translating it from the
German, for she could not read it. It eased his mind. Already he
felt the weight of the burden lifting that she was knowing about
the matter.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you have done this, Matt." Ida was cool and poised,
keeping from him how it had shaken her to the depths. "I
appreciate it. It makes me know how frank you are, and how honest
you would have been with me."</p>
<p><i>"'Would have been,'</i> Ida! You can't . . . This doesn't
mean anything to me . . . not <i>anything</i> now, excepting a
bit of sorrow for . . . for her. You must know it. I shouldn't
have shown you the letter . . . I was . . ."</p>
<p>"Listen, Matt." She was firm of voice, still poised, but he
did not see how her hands were holding each other tightly, each
trying to keep the other from its trembling.</p>
<p>"There is something I must know . . . to-night . . . just now
. . . before the invitations go out to-morrow. You owe it to me .
. . to yourself . . . to her. Answer me this, Matt. Everything
depends upon what you say. I can't go on until I know. If we
two--this other young woman and I--were side by side in this
room. . . . If she . . . just as you knew her . . . and I . . .
just as I am . . . were here together. . . . If you walked in
here and we were waiting, which one would you choose?"</p>
<p>She was looking bravely at him, her gray eyes steady and
unflinching, watching to ascertain how the question affected him,
and yet not wanting to see.</p>
<p>Matthias did not hesitate. He looked back steadily into the
honest depths of her eyes. "All right," he could even smile now.
"You are here . . . and she is here. I am to choose between you.
But you have omitted something. What you have forgotten to say is
that two Matthias Meiers would walk in here, a
twenty-one-year-old one and I. You and I don't care much which
one the young cub would choose, now do we? What concerns us is
that I . . . the man standing here beside you, would choose
<i>you."</i></p>
<p>"Unqualifiedly, Matt?" She searched his face.</p>
<p>"Unqualifiedly. Does it satisfy you?"</p>
<p>"It satisfies me. You're good to put it that way. I think you
believe it. I'll never mention her again."</p>
<p>He kissed her,--more tenderly than he had ever done. She cried
hard for a few moments so that he comforted her but could not
understand the tears. They were the last she shed for any hurt
from Matthias, for she was not the crying kind.</p>
<p>In his boarding-house, he went over the queer quality of the
question . . . Ida's intensity, the unusualness of her suppressed
emotion, his satisfied feeling that the answer he made had been
the right one.</p>
<p>But he could not get to sleep. For a long time he lay
listening to the early morning sounds of the small town,--a milk
wagon going through the street, its cans rattling together, a
night watchman's tramp of feet on the high wooden sidewalk.</p>
<p>Just as he was dropping off, dimly between him and the window
he saw Amalia, pink and white, infinitely sweet and alluring,
heard vaguely for a moment the sound of a meadow-lark and the
honk of wild geese flying.</p>
<p>He called to her, his arms seeking her, but she was gone. He
woke and lay very still, breathing hard, shaken by the queer
thing he had dreamed.</p>
<p>The next day the duties of the store, the meeting with people
who spoke of the coming wedding and congratulated him on the
young woman he was choosing, Ida's natural talk about her
preparation for the wedding, drove into the realm of the unreal
the momentary pangs he had felt concerning the girl he once loved
so deeply.</p>
<p>In the evening he wrote an answer to Fritz,--several of them.
"I am going to be married" was the theme of one,--"I am married,"
of another. "Remember me kindly to Amalia" and "Give my love to
your sister."</p>
<p>Then he wrote one to Amalia herself, trying several ways to
express that which he wished to say, realizing his written German
was atrocious, and disliking them all; for how could he put into
it the delicate touch that would convey to her all that she had
once been to him, tell her that he, too, was living in Nebraska
now because of her,--that he had tried to get to her but had been
caught by sucking sands,--and yet hold her aloof?</p>
<p>He destroyed them all,--and wrote no other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c22" id="c22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Life among the German neighbors in the valley went on in much
the same way that it had gone on before the deaths of Wilhelm
Stoltz and Herman Holmsdorfer in the Easter blizzard.</p>
<p>Wilhelm and Herman both would have said in their arrogant way
that the settlers could not get along without their help and
advice,--that Fritz and Amalia would not know what to do with no
daily commands to guide them in their work, that they would lose
the stock and bungle the crops and nothing would be
<i>recht.</i></p>
<p>But life closes over the vacancies and goes on. The settlers
managed very well without the two, through some of the most
trying years of the state. Fritz and Amalia did as well as the
others, which is not saying a great deal, for the first few years
following the Easter blizzard were lean years.</p>
<p>There were prairie fires and blizzards, grasshoppers and
drouths, Indian raids too close for comfort. Prices for farm
products were so low that it did not pay to haul the scanty crop
to market. So Fritz and Amalia along with the neighbors began
burning corn for fuel. In the little shiningly polished
four-holed stove of Amalia's neat cabin it would snap and crackle
and hold its heat as well as any coal would have done. They
burned hard twisted prairie hay, too, at times.</p>
<p>Amalia made the garden, in the good German way, but she would
not go into the field with Fritz as Lena Schaffer and young Mrs.
Henry Gebhardt and some of the others did for their menfolks.</p>
<p>In spite of the hardships that confronted them always, the
entire colony stayed just a little out of the reach of starvation
and failure. The unceasing labors and good management of the
homesteads by the men,--the thriftiness of the women,--these
brought the settlers safely through a half-dozen years which
drove those of less thrift and stamina from the scene.</p>
<p>To Amalia it was pleasant to have Fritz around. Even-tempered,
a little jolly at times now that he was his own master, Fritz was
a comfortable companion. He took a great deal of pride in Emil
too, teaching him masculine chores,--taking him down to the creek
for muskrat trapping, allowing him to drive the big team when by
his side on the high wagon-seat, letting him husk corn so that
his hard little palms grew more calloused. It caused Amalia to
say one day to Fritz: "A good father you will be some day,
Fritz,--kind and understanding."</p>
<p>But Fritz did not answer, and walked off to the stable
hurriedly as though cross at her saying so.</p>
<p>The day that Minnie Rhodenbach was married to Karl Schaffer,
Fritz went away to Westville with corn for the grinding, so that
Amalia was ashamed he had gone and made excuses why he was not at
the wedding festivities which lasted all day, and neither would
he later go to the christening of Minnie's baby, little
Christina, so stubborn about it he was.</p>
<p>The fall Emil was seven, Amalia got him ready for the
Parochial school held now in the log church. She made him a suit
out of an old one of her father's, every stitch in it tiny and
neat, each one a thought or a wish or a prayer for the sturdy
little son.</p>
<p>"You will now learn all there is to know in books," she said
to him. "Then you will be a fine pastor."</p>
<p>"Yes . . . a pastor I will like to be . . . I can shout and
the pulpit I can pound harder than any."</p>
<p>Amalia laughed at that. "Oh, but there is more to do than
shout and pound. You must know books and all that is in the
Bible. You much preach wise sermons. You must be kind, and know
when to give advice. You must live right and have every act a
good one. You must not sing loudly and pray loudly and then after
that say and do unkind things. That is not Christianity."</p>
<p>Amalia would not have said: "You must not do this way as your
father and your grandfather did." But in her heart she knew she
was drawing pictures of them both.</p>
<p>The morning Emil was to start, Fritz brought the team and
wagon up to the cabin to take him part of the way. Amalia had his
lunch put up in the smallest egg-basket. One would have thought
from the contents she expected her small son to stay a week
rather than a day. From a larder more meager than usual since the
grasshopper siege, she had managed to furnish <i>Speck</i> and
<i>Kornbrot</i> and <i>Äpfelschnitz,</i> which the English
neighbors would have called side meat, corn-bread and dried
apples.</p>
<p>Emil was excited, loud and noisy. He ran in and out of the
cabin with the slate that had belonged to Fritz under his
arm.</p>
<p>Amalia thought she could not stand it, could not bear to see
Emil go away from her to the school. But she must be brave, must
not let this trouble her, for after his fourteenth year and
Confirmation, he must then go on farther away for his learning.
Then would it be time to be troubled at his leaving.</p>
<p>But now that the day had come for schooling and he was
sturdily climbing high over the big wheel of the wagon, she
called to Fritz to wait, ran and got her shawl and her bonnet,
set her <i>Kornmehl maus</i> back on the stove, and went with
them.</p>
<p>At the last half-mile, Emil did not want them to go with him
farther, told them to stop here, so he could get out and walk the
rest of the distance, that the other children might not know he
had been brought in a wagon.</p>
<p>"He is a real boy," Fritz said, watching him trudge through
the rank prairie grass, brandishing a stick toward a host of
imaginary enemies.</p>
<p>But Amalia, sitting in the wagon and gazing after him, could
not see what Emil was doing; so blurred a little figure did he
look that he seemed swimming in the liquid prairie grass.</p>
<p>Always, these years, Fritz worked constantly. Even when
others, far from lazy, were through their work and would
congregate in groups to talk over the drouth and the 'hopper
damage, the war with the Sioux, the rush into the Black Hills for
gold, Fritz must be on the go. The first one in the morning at
work and the last one at night must Fritz always be. Often
Amalia, looking at him, wondered what was driving him so. Every
one worked hard, but he hardest of all.</p>
<p>Sometimes she would say to him: "Fritz, are you never going to
get yourself a wife?"</p>
<p>He would laugh at that. "For the girls I do not care," he
usually answered, but once when she said it playfully, he turned
on her fiercely: "<i>You</i> should ask that." And went out to
the field, although he had just come in, so that for a long time
Amalia tried to think why he said that peculiar thing.</p>
<p>By 1878, times began to be better. When the colonists came
together now, there was not so much head shaking, not so much
talk of drouth and poor crops and hardships,--more talk of
railroads being built,--of the Republican Valley being settled,
of the Pawnees all removed to Oklahoma, of the north part of the
state being opened to settlers. Crops were better. Fritz was
raising enough to eat and even selling a little corn.</p>
<p>There were noticeable changes in the twelve years. A few
fences were here and there around door-yards and gardens. Old
wagon trails over the prairie had the appearance of real roads.
The trees had made unbelievable growth, especially the
cottonwoods with their merry leaves, never gloomy, never silent,
always dancing in any kind of weather. There was a whole flock of
children who had not come in with the wagons,--native-born little
Schaffers and Kratzes, Rhodenbachs and Gebhardts. And there were
six graves there where the tumble-weeds rolled in the autumn and
the sun blazed down in summer and the snows piled in winter.</p>
<p>And Amalia was changed too. Although she still braided her
once-golden hair neatly and wound it around her head, it was now
rather like sun-burned straw. And the rose-petal of her skin was
gone, too, and in its place a redness seared into the delicate
flesh by the prairie winds.</p>
<p>So now with times looking up, and Fritz and Amalia such good
managers, they built a new house to take the place of the cabin,
twelve years old and grown too small and shabby.</p>
<p>Fritz told Amalia to pick out the exact spot of ground she
wanted for it, and while she was making her selection she had a
swift thought that Herman would not have been so
considerate,--that like her father he would have dictated both
place and the plans as he wanted them. Amalia was rather happy
these days with her brother Fritz and husky Emil, now eleven
years old.</p>
<p>Fritz built sturdily and well, even though it took him all
through the year, for he must do his regular work first. Amalia
drove the team to Westville several times, a day's trip, bringing
lumber home.</p>
<p>There was a little cellar this time into which they could put
the potatoes and pumpkins, turnips and onions for winter's use
and into which they could go if a storm threatened. Amalia was
more proud of her cellar than any other part of the house. Fritz
built a slanting outside cellar door upon which she could sun her
milk crocks, and Amalia set out wild gooseberry and currant
bushes close by. Almost was it going to seem like the farm-house
in Illinois where she was born. There were four rooms,--a sitting
room, a kitchen and two bedrooms. Oh, it was rather grand. Amalia
could scarce keep the pride from showing when Anna Kratz and Lena
Schaffer and the Gebhardts and the Rhodenbachs all came to see
the skeleton of it going up there on the prairie.</p>
<p>On a day in November, an Indian summer day with the sun
shining hazily on the wide brown prairie and the trees over by
the river's brink yellow and bronze, and the sumac flaming red,
Amalia moved into the shining new four-roomed house.</p>
<p>The wooden floors were scrubbed until one almost saw one's
face in them and the new rag rug which she had woven was placed
exactly in the center of the sitting-room until such time as they
might have carpeting. The walnut table held the Bible and a conch
shell, and on the wall were hung the two pictures from the old
home,--the <i>Gute Nacht</i> and <i>Guten Morgen,</i> two chunky
semi-nude little girls with daisies in their hair. There was a
motto too, which Amalia's mother had worked in the old country in
dainty stitches, <i>Gott Segne Unser Heim,</i> as though God
seeing it there constantly would not fail to bless their home.
Two rocking-chairs and a book-shelf that Fritz had made from ends
of the lumber for the few German books completed the
furnishings.</p>
<p>The kitchen held the table and the cook-stove with the iron
hearth, the pots and pans and four straight chairs. Fritz put
wooden pegs on the walls for the coats and hats, made a fresh new
wood-box, and for Amalia's birthday bought a gay blue mirror with
tin comb-box underneath. In Amalia's bedroom was the heavy walnut
bureau from her mother, and sometimes she was greatly torn
between leaving it there or having it back in the sitting-room
where strangers stopping on their trips across the prairie could
see it.</p>
<p>It started a perfect disease of unrest among the neighbor
women; followed by an orgy of building. "If Amalia Holmsdorfer
can have a new home of boughten lumber, so can I," became almost
a slogan up and down the river.</p>
<p>Anna Kratz had a new house with five rooms, whereupon Lena
Schaffer could not rest until she had six. Oh, but the German
colony took upon itself the appearance of more comfortable
circumstances.</p>
<p>All of these years Amalia had been very close to her boy.
Always she was talking to him of lovely things, of the beauty in
nature, of the way God manifested Himself,--showing him the
gentler side of life and the more tender. She walked with him in
the timber along the river and talked of the trees as though they
were humans,--the ash and the willow, the cottonwood and the wild
sumac. She taught him many things for which Fritz had no time or
inclination. Together they picked the violets and the
ground-plums, the black-eyed Susans and the trillium, bellwort
and bloodroot and wild columbine, although Amalia's names for
them were not always as these. Together they found the
meadow-lark's nest in the prairie grass and the place where the
owls hooted the night away. She stood with him on the church
knoll which looked over the valley and had him repeat with her
the Psalm of walking through the valley of the shadow of death
and yet fearing no evil.</p>
<p>She had him climb and put back a woodpecker's young one that
had fallen from a nest, called him each night to stop work for a
moment and see the sunset's after-glow, and bade him note that
all things happening now were still like miracles of old.</p>
<p>Sometimes Fritz grew cross at these teachings. <i>"Du wirst
ihm ganz verzärteln,"</i> he would say disparagingly.</p>
<p>But Amalia knew she would not make him a softie, that it did
not make a softie of any one to love beauty in nature. And a
<i>pastor,</i>--how could a <i>pastor</i> better understand
humans than to see God in everything?</p>
<p>So time went on and spring came and turned into hot summer
with the meadow-larks' songs stilled in the heat. Summer turned
into fall with the corn ripe in the shock and the dried
tumble-weeds rolling across the prairie like so many brown waves
of the sea. And almost before Fritz and Amalia could realize it,
Emil was nearly fourteen,--nearly to his Confirmation. After that
would come going away to more schooling in preparation for his
work.</p>
<p>On this spring day Amalia was thinking how it would seem next
fall without him. But to sustain her in the loneliness it would
mean she had only to vision him in the pulpit in his black robe,
and she knew she must make no outcry about his going. When the
other boys of his age were at their farm work, he would be
studying away at the Lutheran college, and the thought filled her
with an ecstasy of pleasure. She would work her fingers to the
bone for Emil's schooling, and Fritz would help her.</p>
<p>Even as Amalia was cherishing these pleasant thoughts, Emil
was sitting near the opened window in the little school-house
looking out at spring coming over the prairie country, as though
it were a person and he could see its tangible form. It was in
the call of the crows, in the warmth of the sun, in the odors of
the loam.</p>
<p>He fumbled the dog-eared reader, looked at a paragraph which
contained no meaning: "<i>In-zwischen hatte Johann Hus die
Schriften von Wycliffe gellesen."</i></p>
<p>As though he cared that in the meantime Johann Hus had the
writings of Wycliffe read.</p>
<p>Back to the window he turned his lack-luster eyes. Over by
Willow Creek there was a faint tinge of green against the gray of
the branches. The rolling prairie stretched as far as the eye
could see. On the top of a knoll far off, a man and team and plow
were silhouetted against the horizon. Maybe it was Uncle Fritz.
For a moment they were all poised there as though drawn with
pencil,--then they passed out of sight.</p>
<p>Something broke in Emil. Some queer condition arose in his
whole being over which he seemed to have no control. He took the
two other thumbed old books out of his desk and a cracked slate
with red flannel binding, tied them to the reader with a frayed
piece of rope, and stood up.</p>
<p>The master rapped sharply on the desk: "What are you doing,
Emil?"</p>
<p>"I go home."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Sit down."</p>
<p>Emil, already on his way to the door, turned and shook his
head stolidly.</p>
<p>The teacher advanced toward him, ruler in hand, but he broke
into a clumping run, passed the bucket of water and was at once
out on the moist prairie grass, from which vantage point he
turned and gave a delicate thumb-to-nose gesture of farewell.</p>
<p>He could not have told just what happened,--did not fully
sense that he was happily freed from the intricacies of
arithmetic and the geography of unknown and undesirable
countries, of memorizing hymns and Catechism and verses. All he
knew was that the school-house had caged him, that spring
called,--and the Land.</p>
<p>As he walked over the spongy ground just released from its
frost, he felt rather than thought about the world around him.
There was the first warm sunshine, and the odors of the prairie
ground from which the new grass would soon shoot. As he looked a
long V-shaped line of wild geese went over. He watched them until
they dropped into the north swampland, then turned on his heel
and broke into a run toward home.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when he arrived with his lunch still
untouched.</p>
<p>Amalia, seeing him coming across the open field, ran out to
meet him. "What is it?" she called. Nothing but illness or
trouble with the teacher would bring him home.</p>
<p>Now that he was here he did not know quite so well how to
handle it.</p>
<p>Fritz came up from the stable. Emil had not thought of this
contingency. Twice Uncle Fritz had licked him when his mother
told him to. He could feel the last thrashing yet. Uncle Fritz
didn't dare now. If Uncle Fritz touched him he would light in and
thrash too.</p>
<p>"I come home," he said stolidly.</p>
<p>"I see," said Fritz. "But why?"</p>
<p>"I'm through school," he swallowed hard.</p>
<p>Amalia was pale to the lips,--it took schooling and much of it
for the <i>pastor's</i> work.</p>
<p>"But why?" Fritz shouted.</p>
<p>Emil turned his head from them. "Never going again," he
muttered. "Going into the field. Going to be a farmer."</p>
<p>Fritz's face relaxed. The shadow of a grin rested on it.</p>
<p>"There goes your pastor, Mollia," he said gruffly, and to
Emil: "The ground is ready to-day . . . get the plow."</p>
<p>But Amalia went into the house and shed bitter tears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c23" id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>So Emil decided for himself he was to be a farmer like Uncle
Fritz, and Amalia with many a secret sighing over the
disappointment put away her dreams of his schooling and a
<i>pastor's</i> robe and a beautiful girl from some city whom he
would one day marry.</p>
<p>But Emil did no sighing,--he was happy and content, and threw
his young strength energetically into the work.</p>
<p>To a certain point he was Herman all over again, energetic,
loud of speech, noisy with laughter. But at that place where
Herman would have been ruthless toward another's feelings,
commanding arrogantly, or scolding loudly,--Emil's manner would
break into something less formidable as the ice breaks in the
springtime, turn gentle with Amalia and end the scene in mere
joking. So to Herman's gifts of physical strength and ceaseless
energy had been added something of Amalia's own,--a bit of her
thoughtfulness and tenderness, a little appreciation of the red
tinge on the prairie clouds.</p>
<p>By 1885 the land was largely fenced. Crops were good. Some of
the out-buildings were new,--corncribs and a hay barn. Trees were
much larger,--the cottonwoods and the elms. Orchards were
bearing,--Amalia could make <i>Äpfelbutter</i> and
<i>Pflaumenbutter</i> every year. There were elderberries,
choke-cherries and wild grapes in the woods, and gooseberries and
currants in the yard. All the land was taken. Homesteads were now
farms. The whole community took on an appearance of prosperity.
In addition to Amalia's and Fritz's farm,--up and down the river
valley stretched the neat places of all the Gebhardts and the
Schaffers, the Rhodenbachs and the Kratzes. If there had been
keen rivalry over houses and barns, children and crops, it had
made for progress.</p>
<p>There was a road to Westville, clogged with snow in the winter
and muddy or dusty in summer, but at that, something better than
the unbroken trail of prairie grass over which they had first
come.</p>
<p>Trains passed daily through Westville, the western portion of
the state was being settled. Every day people going west stopped
in their wagons at some one of the farm-houses on the river for
water or directions or to stay all night. Some were bound for the
Republican Valley, some to the Black Hills of the Dakotas, some
to the grassy plateau in the sand-hills.</p>
<p>The German families had grown more friendly with the English
ones,--the Kirbys and the Blacks and the Lawrences. The women
came sometimes to see Amalia, and every so often she and Anna
Kratz would hitch up the spring-wagon, drive to their homes and
return the calls.</p>
<p>Amalia had a hard time understanding them, and with some
embarrassment and laughter tried to make them know what she was
saying. But after all, a sick child or a new design for a quilt
or a jar of <i>Gurken</i> or <i>Kraut</i> is a common denominator
in all feminine language, and they got along very well.</p>
<p>"I bring you apple-jelly," Mrs. Kirby would say.</p>
<p>And Amalia, like a devoted parrot would repeat: "I brin' you
äpfel-chelly."</p>
<p>All the weeks she would try to remember this, and when she
would arrive at the Kirbys' next time, she would be gay with
laughter, jelly, and the surprise of her English for Mrs. Kirby.
"I brin' you plom-chelly."</p>
<p>But she could not muster a "w" nor a "th,"--ever, all her
life,--nor some of the English words.</p>
<p>"They are water-melon," Mrs. Kirby would say patiently.</p>
<p>"Dey are vater-mel<i>on</i>en." And so far as Amalia was
concerned vater-mel<i>on</i>en they stayed.</p>
<p>For several years the old log church on the hillside had been
gone and in its place a substantial frame, white-painted, with a
spire pointing its long finger to the way all the settlers must
look for guidance.</p>
<p>Ludwig Rhodenbach had made the pews and a high pulpit, and all
the men had turned in and helped build the <i>Pharrhaus</i> for
the <i>pastor.</i></p>
<p>There was a great bell, too, in the tower of the church, that
shook the building and reverberated up and down the valley.</p>
<p>At a passing, it tolled the number of years the dead one had
spent on earth, so that when old Rudolph Kratz died it echoed up
and down the valley for a long time with its eighty-two strokes,
but when Lena Schaffer's little boy died, it gave only a single
tap that was heard by scarcely any one but the caretaker who rang
it and the prairie-larks and Lena Schaffer many miles away.</p>
<p>Emil worked side by side with Fritz all through his 'teens,
strong as a young ox, for he had never known anything but hard
work. Amalia was glad the two got along so well. If there was an
occasional disagreement, it soon passed. Fritz was always quiet.
But Emil, noisy and loud, might rant for a time, start to say
ugly unnecessary things as his father before him, and then,
looking at the gentle face of his mother--suddenly something
would break and his ranting go into nothing. Amalia did not know
how this could be. It just was so.</p>
<p>In 1887 Emil was twenty. The two men had cut a great deal of
wild hay and stored it and there was to be plenty of corn in the
cribs. The combined three hundred and twenty acres were yielding
well. No one gave a thought to the ownership,--that there might
have been some legal question whose land it was after the death
of the two original owners. Fritz and Amalia and Emil thought of
it only as "the place," all working long and hard to feed and
clothe themselves and "put something by."</p>
<p>And now this year, the biggest change, since Herman's and
Wilhelm's deaths, was upon the family. In the late fall or early
winter when he would have passed his twenty-first birthday, Emil
was going to be married. To Anna Marie Rhodenbach! That was
Minnie Rhodenbach's daughter, the child of the Minnie Rhodenbach
upon whom Fritz had cast such longing eyes when she was a young
widow with this little girl. And curiously enough Anna Marie at
eighteen was almost the exact replica of Minnie at the time Fritz
had given his solemn oath never to marry.</p>
<p>Fritz and Emil were building the new house in the very yard
with Amalia's house, although over on the next rise of ground
beyond the slow-growing lilac bushes.</p>
<p>When they started to plan it, Emil had brought Anna Marie over
to talk with Fritz and Amalia about it.</p>
<p>Anna Marie was chubby, her soft round face had dimples at the
corners of her mouth, and when she laughed, which she did very
often, she looked exactly as her mother had looked at
eighteen.</p>
<p>Looking at her sitting there so pretty and soft and demure,
Uncle Fritz said suddenly: "Emil, why don't we build this one
very grand? The place will all be yours some day. This house, it
should be of stone . . . finer than any one's in the valley. You
will have a family . . . they will grow up in it. Who knows maybe
<i>their</i> children too, would live in it. It should be solid
and big. I would like to build one so that all the settlers come
to see it. I would like the best one in the whole county for you.
It would take the year but we could do it fine. What say you,
Emil?"</p>
<p>Amalia warmed so to Fritz's kindness. What a good boy he was.
And why would he want to put so much labor on something for
Emil?</p>
<p>He was thirty-seven now, thin and hard and gnarled, and never
had he looked at a girl.</p>
<p>"You should for yourself be making one." Amalia chided
him.</p>
<p>But Fritz laughed at that. "What girl would look at a gnarled
old bachelor, nearing forty?"</p>
<p>"Oh, there's a plenty," Amalia told him. "I could name as many
as fingers on my hand. Shall I name them?"</p>
<p>But Fritz would not stop planning to listen to the naming of
them. "The good ones are all married already," he said
laconically, so that Amalia pondered it quite awhile.</p>
<p>Fritz and Emil hauled stone from a quarry down the river. It
took a day to come and go. Before he was even fifteen, Fritz had
learned something of the stone mason's craft from his father so
now he built carefully and well.</p>
<p>All the summer and fall of 1887 the two worked on the house
every moment between the necessary crop work. The big thing rose
slowly on its sturdy foundation, every stone solidly placed,
every studding nailed securely.</p>
<p>"It's so sturdy Anna Marie and I will have our golden wedding
in it," Emil told them.</p>
<p>"I shall then be ninety years old," Amalia laughed.</p>
<p>"Yah," Fritz said. "You will live, Millia, to see children and
grandchildren and <i>(vielleicht)</i> great-grandchildren living
in it."</p>
<p>But Amalia could not believe that--it seemed so very far in
the future. Yet it happened to be true,--Amalia was to live to
see Emil and his son and his son's son living in the honestly
built stone house.</p>
<p>It was large for the time and for the young state no older
than Emil himself. There were a parlor and a sitting-room, a
dining-room, a bedroom and a kitchen downstairs, and three more
bedrooms upstairs. If not overly artistic it was strong and
sturdy and as honest as Fritz Stoltz. People came from miles
around to see it. Not in all the days of the settling up of the
river valley had there been put up so big and so good a dwelling.
It sent Anna Kratz home with a sick headache that her Frederich
was to live for awhile in her own discarded cabin.</p>
<p>Amalia could scarcely get used to the idea that Emil was to be
gone from home. But the two houses were only a short distance
apart, something like a town block over at Westville. She thought
with a warm little feeling of pleasure how nice it would be to
have another woman so close. She and Anna Marie could exchange
<i>Kaffeekuchen</i> and <i>Spatzen.</i> Her twenty-two years here
had been only with menfolks about.</p>
<p>She had a dozen quilts ready for the young couple and now
every day she sewed carpet rags, great balls of them ready for
the loom. If all the carpet rags she sewed that summer had been
laid end to end . . . but luckily they never were, but were made
instead into much hit-and-miss striped carpeting for the rooms of
the big stone house.</p>
<p>Anna Marie made quilts, too, and bleached quantities of
tan-colored muslin, sewed petticoats with a great deal of tucking
in them and yards of rick-rack and made many pillow-cases with
crocheted ends.</p>
<p>Emil bought new things,--the most stylish of all, a walnut
bedroom set with marble top to the bureau and a looking-glass
built solidly on the back of it. This was called a <i>dresser</i>
in English, and for all the world as though the dresser had a
child, there was a small one just like it called a
<i>commode.</i> There was a wash-bowl too, and a pitcher, with
three fat red roses on the side of each one. It seemed that
company washed right there in the very room in which they slept
instead of in the kitchen or wash-house. Amalia preened a good
deal when she showed these to Anna Kratz. And she bragged
sometimes about her brother Fritz. "Nothing is good enough for
Emil in Fritz's eyes. The shirt off his back he would take for
Emil. Wanting Emil always to have the nicest things in the
house." Or so it seemed to Amalia.</p>
<p>Christmas time passed with the church services and the
<i>Tannenbaum</i> set up so prettily at the pulpit and the tallow
<i>Kerzen</i> lighted and twinkling among its branches, with the
<i>"Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht"</i> heard everywhere,--at
church, in the houses, at the stables, on the prairie road from
sleighs.</p>
<p>The wedding was set for January twelfth.</p>
<p>The house was finished. Fritz Stoltz surveyed his handiwork.
Emil had worked day and night with him, but he had been the
builder. He felt an indescribable pride in the great solid
structure. It would stand until long after he was up there on the
hill with his father and Herman. He had, after all, something to
leave behind him. It wasn't a son, but it was a sort of
monument,--for Emil . . . and Minnie's little girl.</p>
<p>The wedding was a big event. It took place in the church on
the hill in the morning at ten,--Anna Marie in white India linen
and hand-crocheted lace with a veil. When the ceremony was over,
all went by buggy and lumber-wagon, spring-wagon and carriage to
the new stone house for the wedding feast.</p>
<p>Anna Kratz and Lena Schaffer, young Mrs. Henry Gebhardt, young
no longer but going by that name for twenty-five years, and
Amalia took charge of the great wedding dinner set out on the
boards placed on saw-horses down the length of the combined two
new parlors.</p>
<p>There were <i>Schinken</i> and <i>gebratene Hühner,</i> which
the English neighbors called ham and fried chicken, and
<i>Hühner</i> pressed into loaves. There was <i>Metwurst</i> and
<i>Käse.</i> And there were <i>Bohnen</i> and <i>Pastete,</i>
which Mrs. Kirby told Amalia were called in the English, beans
and pie. There was <i>Kümmel</i> in which the toasts were openly
drunk by all, and there was the strong <i>Roggen Branntwein</i>
slipping about surreptitiously among the men who kept their eyes
peeled for any approaching and potentially protesting wife.</p>
<p>It was the finest kind of a day. On all sides one heard
remarks about it,--January the twelfth and like spring. Yes, it
was as soft and mild as Anna Marie's dimpled face.</p>
<p>"It is a sign of your married life," Lena Schaffer said, ". .
. the way the day is. Ours was stormy, having thunder and
lightning." And she cackled loudly and poked a fat forefinger
into August Schaffer's lean ribs.</p>
<p>Through the feasting the doors were all open. The sun shone
almost warmly, so that men removed their coats and went out into
it that they might boast of it in years to come,--"I remember
like yesterday at Emil Holmsdorfer's wedding,--January twelfth
and I was out o'doors in my shirt sleeves."</p>
<p>There was moisture on the sides of the elms and the
cottonwoods. Hens scratched in the damp steaming ground of manure
piles and on the south side of the straw stacks.</p>
<p>The crowd from the gorging of much food grew less noisy,
settled for a time into an after-dinner lethargy. The women
washed countless dishes. Babies bawled and were put to sleep
upstairs on the new beds high with feather ticks and Amalia's
intricately-pieced quilts. The men drank more <i>Kümmel</i>
openly for old friendship's sake and a little of the <i>Roggen
Brantwein</i> surreptitiously for any fragile reason that
presented itself. Then Elsa Rhodenbach came in and started the
dancing. "Come! Don't be old. This is a wedding, folks; not a
funeral."</p>
<p>It revived the faltering food-stuffed company. August Schaffer
and Adolph Kratz got out their <i>Violinen</i> which the Kirbys
called fiddles, tuned them up and activities began.</p>
<p>In the midst of the dancing some of the men came in to say it
looked stormy in the north,--maybe they must go and do chores if
they were to come back for the evening. Several of the women went
out to look, too.</p>
<p>The north sky was the color of burned-out camp-fire ashes.
There was a hushed quiet over the whole countryside,--that
portentous quiet which is more ominous than noise. Several of the
older men began hitching up, but the young folks danced on. Fritz
slipped away to his barns for early chores. Amalia called
something after him about her chickens. Even as she did so, a
single icy blast snarled down from the low-swinging clouds, the
wind whipped her new silk dress as though it were a rattling
garment of paper.</p>
<p>The storm that followed the initial blast went down into
history as the blizzard of '88.</p>
<p>The snow in great packed masses threw itself at the
countryside, drove its fury all over a snow-bound land. It lashed
at the wedding party, held captive, like a wild thing mad with
the knowledge that it could not hurt the great stone house which
Fritz and Emil had built so well.</p>
<p>Those who had started home, remembering the fate of two of
their original company of settlers so many years before, sought
shelter at the nearest farms, some greatly in danger of losing
their lives before they could fight their way to houses and
barns.</p>
<p>It threw a pall over the gaiety,--the worry about those who
had gone home for the chores. Even Fritz did not come back, could
not make it through the storm from so short a distance.</p>
<p>In the big stone house, the dancing took the minds from the
mad fury of the elements, the food luckily prepared in such
quantities, held out, the <i>Kümmel</i> sustained the thirsty.
Only the drinking of the <i>Roggen Brantwein</i> came to a sudden
termination for the simple reason that with Adolph Kratz, it,
too, had gone home to do the chores.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So now Amalia was thirty-nine, her son a married man, and
never any more did she think of romance for herself or crave
it.</p>
<p>Twice during the years had she been asked in marriage. Several
times young Fred Gebhardt had come to spend Sunday evening when
Emil was small, but Amalia, pretending that she did not know the
reason, kept Fritz from leaving and allowed Emil to sit up long
beyond his bedtime so they could all make merry together with
popping <i>Korn</i> and making molasses candy, until Fred asked
her and she refused him under the noise of the popping
<i>Korn.</i></p>
<p>And once from beyond the valley Otto Weis had driven in
rapidly, explained his matrimonial intentions, given her
gratuitously an inventory of his cows, pigs and chickens, and
explained a little breathlessly that if she were so minded to
take them all on as well as himself, he would appreciate it if
she could come before threshing.</p>
<p>Amalia had laughed in his face and told him to go to the
fourth homestead down the valley and hire Lizzie Gebhardt for two
dollars a week.</p>
<p>No, Amalia craved no more romance for herself. But sometimes
when the sun was gone and there was a moment to spare after the
supper dishes were done, she sat on the porch of the small frame
farm-house and looked across the darkening fields and pastures.
From there she would watch the first stars come out, a night hawk
dip low and the new moon get caught in the branches of the plum
thickets,--would listen to the breeze stirring the leaves of the
cottonwoods and to the cicadas and the good-night call of the
robins that had come of late years,--would catch the scent of the
hay fields and the petunias that bordered the path to her gate.
Then she would open the rusty-hinged door and go into The
Room.</p>
<p>She could not have explained it to any one,--certainly not to
Emil or Fritz, and not even to her daughter-in-law, Anna Marie,
or to Anna Kratz or Lena Schaffer. But it was always there,--a
little chapel more beautiful than any church, built in a clearing
in the woods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c24" id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>For Seven years after Ida Carter's marriage to Matthias she
worked side by side with him in the store, never missing a day
nor a chance to help her husband earn a penny. On hot summer
mornings she rose with the sun and was ready to go with him
through the dusty streets when he left for work. On winter
mornings she was up long before daylight, breaking the ice in the
pitcher for washing, dressing in her flannels and woolen dress,
and was off with him in the dark and the cold.</p>
<p>There were hard times for town people as well as the country
folks in those years after the Meier marriage. Every grasshopper
cast its tiny reflection into Matthias' store, until the whole
became a dark shadow over the counters. Drouth took its toll of
the customers and so of Matthias himself. The little town had
seen its citizens go out to fight a prairie fire which came
rolling in with no apparent regard for the capital's importance.
It had seen an uprising among the convicts in the penitentiary
several miles away so that Matthias shouldered a gun with other
citizens and went out to help quell the riot. It had seen the
burning of the Atwood House with its big twenty-thousand-dollar
loss.</p>
<p>All these seven years Ida Carter lived in her small suite of
rooms in the boarding-house looking forward to the day when she
would have a nice home. But the boarding-house was good enough,
she insisted, until she could stop work and devote herself to a
home.</p>
<p>And then in 1880 her child was coming, so that she must stop
her work at the store. They named the boy Carter and he throve
and grew even as did the little town into which he had arrived
with such welcome.</p>
<p>Even before the baby's coming, the new state had begun to pull
out of the hard times, and with these general conditions bettered
Matthias' business took on noticeable gains.</p>
<p>Life was very pleasant to Matthias these days. Ida was comrade
and friend as well as wife and mother. Any word of hers
concerning the business was worth heeding. And then came word of
the death of Matthias' uncle, and wholly unlooked for, a
fair-sized legacy. Rather suddenly then he sold his share of the
store to his partner, bought stock in one of the banks and became
an officer of that growing institution.</p>
<p>The town had thirteen thousand inhabitants now,--the
University had graduated several small classes. Eight daring
young men on the flying trapeze of their enthusiasm had organized
the Sigma Chi fraternity and were nearly expelled for their
pains. The huge west wing for a new capitol building had gone
up.</p>
<p>There were more convicts in the pen, more inmates in the
asylum,--and many people had been taken out to the acreage in
which to lie down and sleep.</p>
<p>So now Matthias and Ida were to have their new home. It was of
red brick and sat far back from the wooden sidewalk of a popular
residential street, where it seemed to draw its red skirts away
from the splashing of mud all spring and the clouds of fine dust
rolling in through the hot midwestern corn-curing weather. It was
rather awe-inspiring in its massiveness, dwarfing as it did the
modest homes on both sides of it. There were ornate trimmings
over the long, narrow windows, and a tower high above the second
floor could have served as an excellent Indian lookout if there
were need, for from its lofty interior one might gaze over the
undulating prairie as far as man's vision could function.</p>
<p>It was one of the town's most showy residences, but scarcely
had its final oak balustrade been placed, its last piece of
ornate grill-work set in the archway between parlor and library
until plans were laid by the William McCurdeys for a new house
with more oak grill-work and two towers.</p>
<p>They followed each other like mushrooms after rain,--the huge
frame house of a merchant, the red brick one of a banker, the
gray stone of an attorney, all dignified and elegant at the time.
It was only in the light of after years that they looked fussy,
like old ladies bewigged and rouged and loaded with jewelry.</p>
<p>Other town-shaking events were happening. Whereas one had
hallooed lustily heretofore from his porch to the neighbor for
whom a message was intended, or sent the swiftest-legged member
of the family, one might now talk to him through the huge box
fastened on the wall. A half-hundred business houses went up,
many times that number of homes.</p>
<p>When the Meier house was finished Matthias and Ida gave a
housewarming. While scarcely true that half the town came, the
impression was there. Young swains and their ladies danced the
Virginia reel and the mazurka on the intricately inlaid pattern
of the newly polished floors,--a few tackled the schottische.
Young Carter, a big healthy boy, was allowed to stay up until
nine. Ida had succeeded in making him look almost as effeminate
as she desired in his velvet suit with lace collar and cuffs, his
hair in curls to his shoulders. Ida herself had a new striped
heavy silk dress trimmed with bead passementerie over a huge
bustle.</p>
<p>Oyster stew was served in the basement, moist yet from its
fresh mortar, the ladies squealing a little and holding up their
trailing skirts when descending the long, narrow stairway. Some
of the guests had driven to the party in their fringed
canopy-topped carriages, those close by had walked, tip-toeing
across the puddles on the wooden sidewalks, carrying their party
shoes in bags, but a few souls out for adventure and feeling
particularly devilish had taken the new street-car to the nearest
corner.</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs came, looking a bit incongruous among the other
guests with his baggy clothes, his oiled red hair, and his voice
rolling out in the same tones he had employed when he snapped the
bull-whip at the side of the oxen. But Matthias would have him,
and Ida was good-natured about it, laughing heartily with Charlie
when they showed him around the new house and he said he'd swum
in all sorts o' rivers 'n lakes 'n buffalo wallers, but never
swum yet in a big soup-bowl like that there one in the
bathroom.</p>
<p>Aside from a <i>faux pas</i> or two on the part of Charlie,
the whole affair was a huge success.</p>
<p>The newspaper said it was one of the most pleasant occasions
ever known to Lincoln society, that youth and beauty were
rampant, that the Meier residence was a model of elegance, its
proud owners unexcelled in hospitality and the collation the most
appetizing of which ye scribe had ever partaken.</p>
<p>Matthias and Ida were exceedingly pleased over the write-up,
felt a curiosity tinged with impatience to see the one which
would follow the McCurdeys' housewarming in a few months. When it
came out, it said that the party was one of the most pleasant
occasions ever known to Lincoln society, that youth and beauty
were rampant, that the McCurdey residence was a model of
elegance, its proud owners unexcelled in hospitality and the
collation the most appetizing of which ye scribe had ever
partaken.</p>
<p>Life now to the Meiers took on no small degree of prosperity
which in turn gave them their place in the social sun of the
little city.</p>
<p>They went to hear Oscar Wilde lecture and Bill Nye,--to the
Funk Opera House to see Edwin Booth and Modjeska, Lily Langtry
and Fannie Davenport tread the boards. They joined a whist club
and kept up their choir work even if somewhat under fire by
visiting evangelists for combining the two.</p>
<p>Ida joined with a group of her women friends in receiving
calls on New Year's Day to which the gallants of the town in
Prince Alberts made yearly pilgrimages by way of a livery
hack.</p>
<p>At the turn of the decade came one of the outstanding social
events,--the opening of the Lansing Theatre. Matthias was
forty-six now, a little pompous looking with his shovel-cut beard
and a gray patch above each ear,--quite the picture of a bank
vice-president. Ida was forty-three, heavy too, deep bosomed and
molded into her stays, wholly the picture of a bank
vice-president's wife. Her heavy brown hair was piled high on her
head in doughnut formation. In the privacy of her room she
pinched her cheeks to bring color to them.</p>
<p>Carter at eleven was to be allowed to go to the great opening.
"He can't begin too young to hear and see the best things,"
Matthias had said, to which Ida assented with reservations that
he mustn't expect to go often.</p>
<p>The great building towering all of four stories high was a
blaze of light. The boxes were filled with notables. The Governor
was there in the dress circle, and the new young congressman,
William Jennings Bryan, and his wife. The proscenium was a dazzle
of splendor and the audience beautiful and manly if one may take
wholeheartedly the newspaper accounts of the day. A painted
scenic representation of Thalia, the muse of comedy and bucolic
poetry, in an undieted condition, largely covered the sounding
board with a languid pose of nonchalant snootiness surrounded by
corpulent cupids.</p>
<p>Lillian Lewis and her company played. The orchestra rendered
exquisite strains between acts. One would have said it was like a
Chicago event. Culture had come to the prairie.</p>
<p>On the way home Matthias and Ida in their carriage, with the
man driving who doubled in yard work for them, asked each other
what more one could wish for.</p>
<p>Ida said it didn't seem possible all this could have come to
pass in the raw village to which she had come nineteen years
before.</p>
<p>Matthias responded with a rather uninspired: "No, it doesn't,"
. . . thinking, and yet not being able to tell even Ida, of his
long journey alone over the cold, windswept prairie twenty-three
years before, and of his dreaming that one day a city would stand
there on the horizon where stood four or five log houses. He felt
a little awestruck to-night,--it seemed too much like
sorcery,--as though the magic of his thinking had turned the
dreaming into fact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c25" id="c25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>There were changes again in the German neighborhood in which
Amalia Holmsdorfer lived with her brother Fritz. Changes in the
farms, certainly, but more among the people. Deaths, births,
marriages,--they roll in on a community like the tides of the
sea. Most of the marriages had been among the various families
which had come into the state together.</p>
<p>But another element was entering in. Lena Schaffer's boy
married a Kirby girl who was what they called a
<i>Congregationalist.</i> Tsk! Tsk! Probably not a Catechism in
the house and calling a <i>pastor</i> a minister. Young Henry
Gebhardt's girl got into trouble with one of the English Brown
boys,--the trouble not being so bad as the mixed blood.</p>
<p>And the biggest change of all to Amalia,--she was now fifty
years old and a grandmother. Emil and Anna Marie had a little
son, Joe, aged ten now. Three times since Joe's birth, Anna Marie
had expected a child, but after a few months could not carry it.
Anna Marie had now lost her chubbiness to something more
substantial. Fat, in no uncertain terms was what she had come to
be,--a mound of quivering fat which seemed in no way to detract
from her lightness of foot. Looking at her sometimes Amalia
wondered how a fat woman could walk so springily. She had all the
qualities of a rubber-ball, and even though she had to walk
sideways down the porch steps of the big stone house, she seemed
to bounce down from step to step.</p>
<p>Emil was a good husband to Anna Marie. Often Amalia talked
about it to Fritz, wondering in her mind if he remembered their
father's and Herman's harsh ways, but saying nothing about it.
When Joe was born and those other times of her illnesses, Emil
brought home neighbors' girls to work. He bought a two-seated
carriage for her, too, and though Fritz and Amalia rode yet in
the spring wagon, Anna Marie never went anywhere excepting in the
carriage where she sat alone in her grandeur in the back seat
because of her bulk.</p>
<p>Sometimes Amalia would hear Emil telling his wife not to put
so much labor on the house, to let up a little in the work, that
since the new eighty was all paid for, they would be getting
ahead. Four hundred acres in the family now,--that was good.
Amalia knew Herman and her father would have been elated at that
news.</p>
<p>Only this spring Amalia had seen an example of Emil's
thoughtfulness of his wife.</p>
<p>Anna Marie had just pulled the old soap-kettle from the back
porch out to the yard, walking sideways up and down the steps in
that balloon-like way of hers, when Emil came up from the
barn.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" he had asked in the German, for
although they both could speak some in English they chose the
easier way.</p>
<p>"Make soap," Anna Marie had said, "and I'd rather take a
licking than stand and stir."</p>
<p>"Why do you then?"</p>
<p>Anna Marie laughed good naturedly, her dimples making large
holes in her cheeks. "I think because my mother did before me and
her mother before her, and for no other reason, for it is one of
the things I do not like to do."</p>
<p>"Don't do it then."</p>
<p>"But, Emil,--I have all the grease saved and the lye is
leached."</p>
<p>"Throw it away. You do not have to do it any more. A bushel of
corn or two will pay for the soap you would make to-day . . .
maybe make yourself sick too!"</p>
<p>So to Amalia's amazement, she saw her daughter-in-law take the
pans and waddle lightly down to the edge of the orchard, bury the
grease in the ground, throw the cracklings to the chickens, and
sit down on the big porch to rock comfortably all the rest of the
afternoon. Tsk! Tsk! Such a waste.</p>
<p>At night Emil took the iron kettle down to the hog-lot and
cooked mash in it for the little pigs.</p>
<p>So, even though large families were the order of the day,
because of Anna Marie's inability to bear more children, Joe was
to be Emil's only son and Amalia's only grandchild.</p>
<p>It may be for this very reason Amalia centered all her love in
him. So devoted was she to little Joe that he seemed her own,
that she had borne him herself in some distant year with the pain
and the worry now all forgot.</p>
<p>He was less noisy than Emil had been, quiet and
uncommunicative. One had to guess what was on his mind,
withdrawing it by questioning.</p>
<p>"What is the matter, Joey? What have you on your mind that
troubles you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Is it that you cannot go to town with father?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Is it that the little calf died?"</p>
<p>A long silence,--and Amalia knew it was that the little calf
died.</p>
<p>Although he was boyish, full of energy for the farm
activities, never a day passed that he did not come down the path
between the petunias, to the frame house where Amalia and Fritz
lived. She kept cookies in a big stone crock always for Joey. She
kept a bed made for him so that when Emil and Anna Marie would
want to go somewhere without him, he could stay. She kept a
flannel nightgown there for him and a pencil and paper and slate
should he want to do his school work.</p>
<p>And that was another change in the community. Joey went to
English school and did the German work up on the hill with the
<i>pastor</i> only for a time in the summer vacation. There was a
country school-house on a corner of the Lawrence land called the
Evergreen School. It was under a county superintendent, and all
the children, both German and English, must attend.</p>
<p>Joey could talk the English just like the Kirbys and the
Lawrences, but he could talk the German, too, and usually did
with Amalia. But sometimes, in proud boyish way, he wanted to
give her an English lesson and although it was tedious and tiring
to Amalia, she was patient for the little boy's sake.</p>
<p>"It is a nice day."</p>
<p>"It iss a <i>schön</i> day."</p>
<p>"No, Grandma. <i>Nice."</i></p>
<p>"It iss a nitze day."</p>
<p>"This is soup."</p>
<p>"Dis iss <i>Suppe."</i></p>
<p>"No, Grandma. Soup."</p>
<p>"Sss . . . oop."</p>
<p>And the lesson would go only into laughter and the eating of
more cookies.</p>
<p>But in one way, Amalia's association with Joe was identical
with that of her own little boy, Emil,--the talking to him of all
the lovely things about the farm, of the beauty in nature and the
way God manifested Himself. She walked with him in the timber
along the river,--a little less buoyantly now because of her
fifty years,--and talked of the trees as though they were
humans,--the ash, the willow and the cottonwood, and the wild
sumac. Together they picked violets and black-eyed Susans and
trillium, bellwort and bloodroot and wild columbine, and although
Amalia's names for them were not always as these, Joey knew these
very words in the English and taught them to her.</p>
<p>Together they found the meadow-lark's nest in the grass and
the place where the owls had hooted away the nights in the woods
for thirty years. She stood with him on the church knoll which
looked over the valley and had him repeat with her in German the
Psalm of walking through the valley of the shadow of death and
yet fearing no evil.</p>
<p>Fritz did not reprove her as he had done when Emil was small,
did not tell her she would make of him a softie. Fritz was nearly
fifty now, himself, and someway in the years, he had learned that
it is not always softness to be tender.</p>
<p>Sometimes she asked Joey if he would not like to go away to
school and study to be a <i>pastor.</i> But Joey's answer was
always the same, that he would farm all the land and buy more and
be the biggest land owner in the county.</p>
<p>So the farm work went on,--a thing of plowing, harrowing,
planting, cultivating, laying by the corn, picking it to toss
into the wagons, husking it in the big barns,--of wheat planting
and harvesting,--of butchering, smoking <i>Speck,</i> making
<i>Mettwurst</i> and smoked <i>Schinken,</i> of discouragement
over low prices, chuckling pleasure over high ones, of occasional
seasons of drouth and short crops, and others of too much
moisture followed by rust, of the eternal vigilance over the
management of the place which is known only to natural-born
farmers. And always one eye on the weather. Rain, dew, sleet,
hail, drouth, snow, frost, ice, sunshine, cloudiness,
wind,--every morning Emil and Fritz and Joe stepped out of the
house with the question on their lips,--which, from the long list
of his cohorts had the weather man marshaled for the day? By the
small margin of difference in the various combinations would
there be success or disaster.</p>
<p>Most amazingly Joe soon went to High School over at Westville.
When he had read all the readers and studied all that the country
school-teacher had for him, Emil sent him over to the town
school.</p>
<p>"Parochial school was good enough for me," Emil said, "but I
want Joe to have better."</p>
<p>So with his books tied on the saddle and his lunch in a tin
box, he rode his pony every day to school over the road no longer
grass-grown but worn hard and black now from the travel of the
thirty-five years. Sometimes he even stayed after school awhile
to play baseball and, though Emil needed him badly, he did not
swear at him and scold as many of the fathers did, but said: "Get
around home a little quicker to-morrow and help with the
corn."</p>
<p>It was a great night for the Holmsdorfers when Joe graduated.
It was called "the Class of 1907" and four of the graduates were
from the families of the old friends in the valley,--Joe, Rose
Schaffer, Henry Gebhardt, the third, and Nora Kratz, Anna Kratz's
grand-daughter.</p>
<p>Amalia was so proud of Joe one would have thought she was the
mother instead of the grandmother. She was fifty-nine now, with
not a semblance of the lovely girl she had once been, but an old
woman, wrinkled and worn from much hard labor. Fritz was
fifty-six and he, too, looked older than his years, gnarled and
thin and weather-beaten from his long seasons of battling with
the elements.</p>
<p>Joe had something of a time getting ready, what with carrying
a wash-tub up to his room for a bath and when almost dressed
having to run over to Amalia's for the tie stick-pin he had left
there.</p>
<p>But they were all ready in time, although they went in three
different rigs. Fritz and Amalia had owned a buggy for several
years and they went in that. Joe, excited and not knowing just
when he would leave "the bunch" after the exercises, took his own
rubber-tired buggy.</p>
<p>Emil and Anna Marie went in the two-seated carriage. From the
window Amalia saw them leave a little before she did,--Emil
driving up close to the porch and Anna Marie coming sideways down
the steps, but lightly like a balloon, and then sitting alone in
the grandeur of the back seat as they drove away.</p>
<p>The exercises were very fine, Amalia thought, and although
neither she nor Fritz could read a word of the programs, they
studied them diligently between speeches.</p>
<p>Rose Schaffer looked as pretty as her namesake, the prairie
roses. They called her by a frightfully long name and although
Amalia whispered to Fritz to ask if he knew what the word printed
there meant . . . that one,--V-a-l-e-d-i-c-t-o-r-i-a-n, Fritz
shook his head.</p>
<p>But although there were seventeen in the class, Amalia had
eyes only for Joey with his fine shoulders thrown back so
proudly, and his nice suit Emil had let him pick from the
catalogue. They spoke and sang and received their papers rolled
up and tied with ribbons, and last of all they gathered in a
group and yelled something which sounded louder and worse than
the time the Indians yelled around the molasses jug and the
feather pillow.</p>
<p>When Amalia and Fritz went out of the "opera house" to leave
for home a fog had fallen over everything. It enveloped the night
like a ghostly presence so that Fritz had to let the horses walk
and feel their own way. Never had the road seemed so long. They
knew when the horses turned the corner on the valley road, and
later hearing the grate of the iron tires, knew they were
crossing the railroad track, at the curve. Other than that, they
scarcely knew their bearings until the faithful team turned in at
the farmyard.</p>
<p>Several times Amalia peered out to see whether there was a
light in the big house but never seeing one for the fog, she went
on to bed.</p>
<p>It was an hour later when the voices sounded outside the door,
lanterns flashed, and some one was calling Fritz.</p>
<p>Something terrible seized Amalia, a premonition of impending
disaster. As she pulled a dress over her muslin nightgown and
lighted a lamp, her hands shook, so that the matches went out
twice. She was trembling so she could scarcely get to the door,
asking "What's wrong?" in the German.</p>
<p>Fritz was ahead of her, and together they stood, lamp high, in
the doorway peering out at Karl Schaffer and young Adolph Kratz
and his wife and Anna Kratz, Henry Gebhardt, and back of these
old friends two Westville men standing apart, and at Joey coming
from beyond them, running, pushing through the fog, pushing
through the men and the women, elbowing them aside, white, wild,
crying and calling:</p>
<p>"Grandma,--Father and Mother are dead."</p>
<p>"Was ist, Joey?" Amalia was confused and the English words
only added to it.</p>
<p><i>"Vater und Mutter sind todt."</i></p>
<p>And then Amalia understood.</p>
<p>Emil and Anna Marie, alive and well and proud of their fine
boy two hours ago, were not now alive and well, and were quite
incapable of further pride in their fine boy.</p>
<p>At the railroad crossing by the curve in the dark of the fog
it had happened when the night passenger came through. The men
thought Emil must have mistaken a headlight for a light in the
Lawrence farm-house. Or so it might have been.</p>
<p>There were details which they were keeping from Joe and
Amalia, one gathered. But Amalia was strong. No one knew where or
how she could obtain all that reserve strength, nearly sixty as
she was, little, too, and almost frail. She went from the small
house to the big one and back in the days that followed. She saw
the <i>pastor</i> and gave directions for the services. She
picked out the things for them to put on her boy and his wife,
and comforted Minnie Rhodenbach Schaffer, Anna Marie's mother,
who came with her other sons and daughters.</p>
<p>She sent Fritz, broken up as he was, out to the horses,
knowing that he always found comfort in their sleek hides and
their gentle nosing of him. But most of all she helped Joe pull
himself together.</p>
<p>"It is happy for them, Joey," she said steadily, although it
took effort to say the words. "Always from the time your father
was seventeen, there was no one but your mother for him. He loved
her, and she loved him and no other. That is a very happy thing.
So few people are of that way. They loved each other. They were
fine people. They gave you life. It is your gift from them. And
now they go where there is nothing but more happiness . . . for
them . . . and they go together. That is the nicest way of all .
. . no long sickness, no worries about leaving their boy . . .
just suddenly . . . and together."</p>
<p>And Joe threw up his head and went bravely through the long
ordeal because of what his grandmother had said.</p>
<p>He could do all this because she had put her own strength into
him, and because he did not know that in her own bedroom after
she had watched him fall asleep these nights, she dropped on her
knees and cried aloud in her anguish, finding it hard to walk
through the valley of the shadow of death and yet fear no
evil.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c26" id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Only Amalia, Fritz and Joe were left now of the family. It was
crushing. One could not sense the thing that had happened so
suddenly in the midst of their ordinary everyday life.</p>
<p><i>"Im mitte des Leben sind wir in Tode,"</i> the
<i>pastor</i> had said that June day when all the countryside
came, so that the road winding up to the old white church was
packed with carriages. <i>In the midst of life we are in
death.</i></p>
<p>There had been wild roses that day, tangled everywhere in the
prairie grass on the hill and a pair of thrashers had flown
scolding over the heads of the people for disturbing their young.
The bell had tolled forty long slow strokes for Emil whom every
one respected,--thirty-eight for Anna Marie whom every one
loved,--and then because this was so strange a service, the
caretaker had added nineteen full, resonant strokes for the years
of their married life together. All over the valley were the
solemn notes heard, so all should remember that in the midst of
life they were also in death.</p>
<p>The fields that had called to Emil were calling yet. But now
it was Joe who answered, who plowed and planted and
harvested.</p>
<p>Fritz and Amalia moved to the big stone house and left the
small one standing vacant and a little forlorn. "Some day when
Joey brings a wife home to the stone house, we shall come back,"
Amalia said to Fritz as she moved her things, carrying in her
hands her shell box carefully wrapped in its unbleached
muslin.</p>
<p>So in the next few years Amalia and Fritz were mother and
father to Joe just as they had been to Emil, his father, before
him. But things were quite different now. Emil had stayed so
closely on the place, going only to services and to see Anna
Marie and sometimes on the wolf hunt or taking part in some other
mannish activity. But Joe had his rubber-tired buggy and a pair
of slim, fast-stepping horses. He seemed restless. No one worked
harder, but always after the work he was cleaning up and leaving.
Sometimes he told where he was going,--more often not. Amalia
worried about it a little. Such a close-mouthed boy and so hard
to understand.</p>
<p>There was new machinery on the place. The old cradle and
reaper were falling to pieces in the weeds behind the barn. There
was a binder. One might ride now at the plowing. Tsk! Tsk! Like
going to town.</p>
<p>Joe was all English now in his talk, would seldom offer to put
anything into the German for Amalia and because he did not do so
of his own accord, Amalia felt a certain pride in not asking him
and would try so very hard both to understand and to express
herself. In truth, the whole colony was changing in that respect.
A Kratz had married a Lawrence. A Gebhardt had married a Black.
Two of the Schaffers were at this moment keeping company with two
Kirby sisters. All was changing.</p>
<p>The old white church on the hill was gone this last year and
in its place a solid red brick and the <i>Pfarrhaus</i> for the
<i>pastor</i> matched it. Only the old bell was not worn out
although it had called to worship and tolled and caroled for
thirty years. More than these material changes, the services were
part English,--there had been almost a rumpus over it, and again
over whether to have a short sermon in German and another in
English immediately following, or the German every other Sunday.
They said they must do it to hold the young folks. Hold them,
thought Amalia. How queer! No one could have made her miss church
when she was young. What would her father . . . what would
Wilhelm Stoltz have said to that,--getting the colony to come out
here so they could keep together and retain their customs?</p>
<p>And then rather suddenly Amalia found out where Joe was going
this summer of 1910. It was to see Rose Schaffer who had
graduated in his class three years before.</p>
<p>It relieved her immensely and pleased her too. Rose Schaffer
was everything that Amalia would have wanted for Joey. Pretty,
neat and clean, so pleasant to every one. Oh, but that would be
<i>schön,</i>--no, nice. She could hardly wait to tell Fritz when
he came in from the field. They were cutting the new alfalfa
which Joe had insisted on sowing. Fritz was all for the old
things he understood,--Joe for the new. Fritz was sixty-one, not
so young any more, but hardy as a hickory tree. He had given up
readily enough about the alfalfa. He was easy-going and, anyway,
it would all be Joey's place,--four hundred of the best acres in
Nebraska.</p>
<p>"If he wants to plant pepper-nuts," Fritz had said, ''nothing
will I say."</p>
<p>Amalia had laughed heartily at that, for <i>Pfeffernüsse</i>
were Christmas cookies.</p>
<p>So Amalia was full of excitement over the news that she had
just heard from Anna Kratz whose daughter had told her that
<i>her</i> daughter had told <i>her</i> that Joe was keeping
steady company with Rose Schaffer.</p>
<p>"Maybe we shall soon move back to the little house, Fritz. See
to it that you keep it well painted and repaired and that it
always stands ready."</p>
<p>Fritz laughed at that, teasing her whether he should start to
pack.</p>
<p>And then others told it about and every one seemed to know
it.</p>
<p>Amalia surreptitiously began making a quilt for Joey,--the
Jacob's Ladder design. Joe, himself, said nothing. Such a
boy,--one never knew what he was thinking. Always doing his work
so silently and well. Perhaps she couldn't expect him to confide
in his grandmother. But sometimes she wanted so badly to know how
things were with him that she hinted, not quite subtly: "What's
come of all your old class, Joey,--what's come of Rose Schaffer?
Do you never see her any more?"</p>
<p>She would be asking in the German, he replying now in the
English.</p>
<p>"Sure I do, Grandma. I saw her last night. We went over to
Westville to the band concert."</p>
<p>"And how was she?" as unconcerned as though it were mere
conversation, and not the vital thing it was.</p>
<p>"Oh, she's always up and coming."</p>
<p>Amalia was satisfied,--entirely pleased with his choice. If
Joe had sent her out on a shopping trip for a wife she believed
she would have returned with Rose Schaffer.</p>
<p>Life took on a new interest now. It would be like living over
Emil's young days to have Joe bring Rose to the big stone house.
She planned every day for it, expected any time now that Joey
would tell her the news. She could even anticipate the
conversation, so well did she know her Joey.</p>
<p>He would approach it like this:</p>
<p>"Grandma, what would you think if I should bring some one else
here to live with us?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Joey,--do you mean it?" She must be surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes . . . I've been thinking of it."</p>
<p>"You mean a wife, Joey?"</p>
<p>"Yes. What would you say to my bringing Rose Schaffer?"</p>
<p>Oh, she would like it,--like it very much indeed. Kind,
substantial Rose with a pleasant word for every one,--a girl who
would be like a daughter. And it would be nice to live in the
little house again and have only the work there to do. Let's see,
how old was she now? Almost sixty-two. Time to take it easier.
Yes, she would welcome the change,--with Rose nearby for
company.</p>
<p>And then the corn was in and the butchering done. The fall
winds blew cold across the country bringing a flake of snow or
two as though messengers had been sent ahead to remind the
countryside of what would soon follow.</p>
<p>Amalia, standing at the kitchen window of the big stone house
on a Saturday morning, rubbed away the steam to see out. Across
the dark fields and the bare brown stubble she could see the big
comfortable white farm-houses and the red barns of two of the
neighbors,--the Adolph Kratz place and the Gus Rhodenbachs'.
Everywhere the fields were precisely laid out and fenced,
square-shaped or long like Joey's dominoes,--not much like the
old days of patches of crops here and there with no fences. On
the main highway some county commissioner had tried a new-fangled
idea of having little stones and gravel hauled for people to
drive over. Joe was all for it, Fritz against it. Joey always for
the new, Fritz for the old.</p>
<p>What had been wide sweeping prairie was as cut up now as roads
and fences could make it,--so much for wheat, so much for corn,
this square for pasture and that one for the new alfalfa hay.
People scarcely used the word <i>prairie</i> itself any more, so
subdued and tamed was the wild thing of an earlier day.</p>
<p>As Amalia looked she saw two men with guns crossing the
Kratzes' cornfield. That was a part of the wolf hunt to which
Joey had gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe, out on the wolf hunt, swung along over the frozen
cornlands, his gun pointing as his father had taught him. He had
sighted a coyote once and heard the wild call of others not long
before. Far across the field he could see a couple of the
hunters, probably young Jim Rhodenbach and his dad taking their
cut across the field. Outside the fences down the road, teams
were tied and the Kirbys' new automobile was nosed up to the
pasture. Noisy things--these automobiles--scare all the horses to
death.</p>
<p>The cold bit like a steel trap. Had almost forgotten what it
felt like after the hot summer harvesting and the mild fall
corn-picking.</p>
<p>The finish of the hunt would be somewhere near the Schaffers'.
He was glad of that,--could drop in and get a cup of hot coffee
and see Rose a few minutes. Pretty fine girl,--Rose. Queer how he
had never thought very much about her in High School,--merely
given her a lift to town occasionally or talked over some lesson
a few minutes. But it was different now.</p>
<p>He grinned cheerfully to himself,--she was his girl now all
right. Ever since the High School Alumni banquet in June.
Something had happened,--he didn't know just what, but things had
been different since. He had gone alone, stagging it as usual.
She had come with a couple of the other girls from the old class
of 1907. Out three years now. Gosh, you couldn't realize it.
Seemed as though the class had drifted apart,--Chick Adams and
Ray Hostrop and Fat Leaman all going away to college that way.
Fraternity fellows now,--with college yarns to spring. Two or
three of the girls, too, were back from college or girls'
schools. Couldn't blame them for hobnobbing together with a lot
of things in common. He'd like to have gone too, but father and
mother . . . just then. . . . Not much use in it either, would
have just come back to farm anyway and you didn't have to go away
to school to learn that. You knew all about that from the time
you were a kid.</p>
<p>They had sat side by side at the banquet,--he and Rose. That
was when it had happened and for the life of him he didn't yet
know <i>what.</i> All he knew was that before he went he hadn't
thought any more of her than of any other neighbor girl. When it
was over and he had taken her home in his new yellow-wheeled
rubber-tired buggy he knew she was his girl. And Rose knew it
too. He hadn't asked her to marry him yet. Seemed silly to have
to put it into words when each one understood, but he supposed
he'd have to. Christmas Eve,--that would be the time. Christmas
exercises at the church,--ask Rose after those--have the diamond
ring in his pocket,--a pretty nice one too,--could use some corn
money--seventy-five, or eighty dollars, maybe.</p>
<p>They were closing in now. Men were shouting. The guns opened
up. By an almost miraculous watchfulness on the part of a kind
providence no human's life was sacrificed, although practically
all were in jeopardy, for in the last stages of a coyote round-up
shots were as wild as the wolves themselves.</p>
<p>There were seven gray gaunt forms thrown on the pile. There
were some drinks and much smoking and whacking of cold hands
together to take away their numbness,--then Joe was off through a
creek-bed and up a ravine, across a pasture to the Schaffers'
house.</p>
<p>He tapped on the kitchen door with a simultaneous opening of
it and stepped in. Odors of newly baked cinnamon-rolls and fresh
coffee assailed his nostrils as the spices of Araby might have
assailed a traveler. Rose was flushed from the baking, but pretty
enough to kiss. His heart warmed to her and he was crossing the
room, suddenly inspired to carry out the suggestion when he
stopped short, for a young girl came from the Schaffer
dining-room and stood in the doorway,--a dainty little thing in a
blue kimono held tightly around her cute form. Her eyes swept Joe
with a soft pleading expression.</p>
<p>"This is Miss Bates, Joe, the new teacher to take Miss Ray's
place. She's going to stay here. Miss Bates, my friend, Joe
Holmsdorfer."</p>
<p>The new teacher's name was Myrtie,--Myrtie Bates. She had a
delicate flower-shaped face, coming to a sensitive little pointed
chin. Her big blue eyes were as soft and innocent as a baby's.
She smiled on Joe so gently, with something so vaguely sad in the
smile that he felt suddenly sorry for her, but just why he could
not have told.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c27" id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>November slipped into December. The Christmas exercises this
year were partly in English. It disappointed Amalia. The older
she got the more she clung to the old ways. Perhaps she should
not do so, but it was hard to change. When the young folks sang:
"Silent Night . . . Holy Night," Amalia hummed it too under her
breath, <i>"Stille Nacht . . . Heilige Nacht."</i> It sounded
sweeter the old way, and more tender.</p>
<p>Joe was there with Rose and another girl who, Fritz told her,
was the new teacher of the Evergreen School. She lived at
Schaffers'. Joe had been over to Schaffers' so much lately,--Anna
Kratz told her she always watched from behind the curtains to see
when he went by in his buggy. Anna said sometimes she could see
he had two girls with him. That Anna! <i>Alte Klatsch!</i> Old
gossip, Joe called it in English.</p>
<p>The exercises over, she and Fritz drove home. There was no
snow, but the moonlight was so bright it gave the appearance of
white everywhere.</p>
<p>When Fritz put the team away and came in, something depressing
seized Amalia. It was Christmas Eve and no time for feelings of
this sort, but getting home this way from the exercises with
Fritz brought it all back, that other night three and a half
years ago when they had come home through the fog. And even
though she put her packages for Fritz and Joey under the tree and
tried to make it seem a happy occasion, she could not do so.
Something made her wish constantly that Joe would come, made her
listen for the thud of the horses' hoofs on the hard frozen
ground.</p>
<p>She could not sleep. Joe had been late before,--dances and
candy pulls,--but never like this. She got up. Three o'clock. The
weirdness of the moonlight worried her as much as darkness ever
had done. She went back to bed. She thought how queer it was that
Joey was her grandchild and yet he was her son. It was as though
she had borne two sons,--Emil and Joey. You never outgrew that
maternal feeling for a child for whom you had cared. That was why
people could adopt children and feel the same toward them as
toward their own flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Four o'clock and he had not come.</p>
<p>By five the roosters were crowing. She got up and dressed.
Something had happened and she could not stand the strain. The
agony of all the things that had ever troubled her seemed to
return in a great nightmare of foreboding. Always she was losing
the people for whom she cared: Fritz and Joe were all that were
left, and if anything happened to Joey, there would be no least
reason for living.</p>
<p>Six o'clock. The stock was bawling. Fritz was up. Amalia
walked the floor, peered from the windows into the gray of the
dawn which was coming. Then she heard the team come in. She
slipped back into her bedroom and closed the door, sat on the
edge of the bed trying to think what could have happened. Some of
the thoughts she put from her as unworthy. Whatever it was, she
must be kind,--be motherly and patient.</p>
<p>She got breakfast, made a cheerful remark or two and busied
herself at another task while Joey ate. They opened their
presents, but there was no Christmas feeling among them. Joe went
silently about his work during the forenoon. There was Christmas
dinner, but though she lighted <i>Kerzen</i> and put them on the
table, the meal was not Christmaslike. After supper Joe hitched
the team, came in and dressed up, said shortly as he left: "Don't
leave a lamp for me."</p>
<p>Amalia lay in her bed and looked at the black walls of her
room. Of all the crosses that she had borne,--of all the
hardships that life had brought her,--there was something about
this that was the most frightening. She could not have told why
she was so shaken. It was as though a strange person had taken
the place of her boy,--as though the air about her that was
recently so clear was now smoky with gases,--poisonous and
stifling.</p>
<p>In the morning she heard the team come in and looked out to
see Joey helping a girl out of the buggy. Amalia could have
laughed and cried with relief. She saw it all now. He was
bringing Rose home just as she had known he would do. That would
be Joey's quick way--no fuss, no plans, no talk,--just bring her
home when the time came.</p>
<p>Amalia started out to meet them. But when they came up on the
porch, she saw it was not Rose. It was a strange girl,--a pretty
little girl with a flower-like face and big eyes like a
baby's.</p>
<p>"Grandma, this is my wife," Joe said. "Her name is
Myrtie."</p>
<p>"How do you do?" the girl said coolly.</p>
<p>Amalia thought she would faint. "Vy . . . vy. . . ." Always
she talked more brokenly when under stress. She wiped her hands
on her apron and held one out to the girl. "Velcome to <i>unser
Heim . . .</i> our home."</p>
<p>But Rose! Rose! What about Rose? Her mind was asking it so
loudly that she was afraid it could be heard.</p>
<p>All morning Amalia was confused,--so upset that she had to
stop in the kitchen every little while when doing her work and
think it all over. Joey had married a girl and brought her home.
A strange girl, <i>not Rose,</i> not even German. Every time
Fritz came into the kitchen with milk pails or to warm the
chicken feed, she would look at him with questioning eyes and
whisper in German: "Why is it so?"</p>
<p>But poor old Fritz did not know why it was so,--could have no
way of knowing that a girl with wide baby blue eyes and cuddling
ways and no deep sense of loyalty would deliberately take a man
away from her friend,--even though it was a good-looking young
man with four hundred acres of the best land in Nebraska. How
could Fritz know this,--who had the kind of ethics that would
always keep a promise?</p>
<p>Amalia got dinner. She had roast chicken and mashed potatoes
and gravy, cole slaw and a pie from her Greening apples in the
cellar. And she got out the good pink-flowered dishes and set the
table in the dining-room, turning the plates over carefully and
putting her stiff new napkins upright in the drinking glasses.
She could think only of the queer thing that had happened, but so
often had she roasted <i>Hühner</i> and baked <i>Pastete</i> that
she did it all mechanically.</p>
<p>Myrtie sat in the big sitting-room and looked at the album and
the few English books in the corner bookcase while Amalia
prepared the dinner. She ate heartily for such a little
delicate-looking thing. Joe could scarcely take his eyes from her
at the table. He helped her to the white of the chicken and
wanted to know if she would rather have peach-sauce than her
pie.</p>
<p>After dinner when Joe went to the barn to look after his team
and Amalia washed the good pink-flowered dishes, Myrtie went into
the cold parlor, wrapped herself in the crocheted afghan and took
a nice long nap on the red plush couch.</p>
<p>For a week Amalia did all the work in the big stone house, and
always a little worried, kept wondering what was best to do. Then
she broached the subject. "Joe, <i>vielleicht</i> maybe Fritz and
I <i>besser</i> over in de old house <i>geh</i> . . . go. We can
fits it up." Amalia must always talk the English now as best she
can for Myrtie does not know the German at all,--not a word.
Fritz, too, should speak it always. Amalia must remind him of it.
She felt a little cross with Fritz now, sitting and looking at
his plate so timidly, as though this new girl could make Fritz
feel not at home in the house he himself had built over twenty
years before.</p>
<p>Myrtie spoke up immediately and answered for Joe that it would
be a good plan to move.</p>
<p>"I vould before go," Amalia said, "but I t'nk maybe I should
de vork do." She spoke slowly and carefully, thinking it out.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no." Myrtie said pleasantly. "You can go. We won't
need you. I'm going to keep a maid,--can't I, Joe?"</p>
<p>"Vass ist . . . a mait, Joey?" Amalia questioned.</p>
<p>"Myrtie means a hired girl, Grandma. Yes, I guess we can
manage that . . . all right."</p>
<p>Myrtie turned soft baby blue eyes on Joe and said: "Another
thing, we're going to have this house all made over, aren't we,
Joe?"</p>
<p>"Sure," Joe said, "any way you want it, Myrtie."</p>
<p>So Amalia moved back to the old house. Myrtie acted gracious
and bubbling with good nature the day they left, told Amalia to
take anything she wanted; for she and Joe were going to have all
new things.</p>
<p>It worried Amalia. Of course everything they had was Joey's
and always would be, but farmers were not rich people. And all
those things new when Anna Marie and Emil were married,--the red
plush parlor set and the dresser, and its child, the commode, and
the wash-pitcher and bowl! Tsk! Tsk!</p>
<p>But Myrtie gave them all as graciously to Amalia as though she
had owned them the twenty years instead of a week, told her to
take all the rag carpet and the sale carpet too, for she was
going to have Wilton and Axminster rugs. So Amalia took the
walnut corner cupboard and the high-backed bedstead, the dresser
and commode, the album and the pictures of the fat semi-nude
little girls with daisies in their hair. Fritz backed the wagon
up to the side porch and he and Joe put the furniture into it and
some of the small things, but Amalia walked down the path, grass
choked these last four years, and carried her shell box wrapped
in unbleached muslin.</p>
<p>It seemed quite like old times to be settled with Fritz in the
little home. Anna Kratz came over and spent whole days, so
exciting was it to see all that was going on at the big
house.</p>
<p>For, all winter and all spring, repairs and rebuilding went
on. There were workmen there for weeks. Myrtie had them put wire
all over the fine old gray stones and cover them with little pink
sand that glistened in the sunlight. Delivery wagons from
Westville came into the driveway nearly every day with furniture
which Amalia, pretending that she had always known so, told Anna
Kratz was called Mission furniture.</p>
<p>Myrtie had the walls of the two big rooms decorated in
large-figured paper that gave the appearance of gilt bamboo-poles
slanting across the Aurora Borealis. She had the floors varnished
a shining dark red over which Amalia must walk charily on the few
occasions of her going over to the big house. She used some of
Amalia's beautifully pieced quilts for pads under the mattresses
and her hand-woven rugs for wiping feet.</p>
<p>She had Joe paint their own bedroom blue, and because Joe was
no artist, either by natural instinct or acquired knowledge, he
got too much ultramarine in the mixture so that results gave one
a rather nightmarish impression of a storm at sea. But because
Myrtie liked it, Joe liked it too. Amalia scarcely knew what she
thought about it, excepting to experience a stifled feeling of
wanting to get outdoors away from it under the soft blue of the
sky and the new green of the elms and maples.</p>
<p>All this change about the house took so much of Joe's time he
could scarcely get into the field.</p>
<p>As Myrtie had done none of the work herself, only the
planning, she was not especially tired these evenings so she
coaxed Joe to clean up to go to dances or band concerts in town
every few nights.</p>
<p>When the home was all finished Myrtie would not let Joe come
into the main rooms, or for that matter, any farther than the
kitchen, explaining to him in her cunning babyish way that it
must be kept nice for their friends out from town to see.</p>
<p>Rose Schaffer was holding her head very high these days, going
into town with her father and brothers as though nothing had
happened. Sometimes she even drove the sleek carriage team
herself, their black manes tossing, and the lines pulled taut
over their shining dark bodies. People began hearing that Rose
had gone to help at a neighbor's where there was sickness,--that
she had stayed by old man Rhodenbach all three days that the
death noise in his throat sounded louder than a child's
rattle,--had nursed a Kirby child through lung fever, saved it
too, the doctor said, with the steam from a teakettle and pine
resin dropped into the water,--queerest of all, had helped a
strange girl through childbirth in the school-house on a stormy
Saturday night.</p>
<p>Anna Kratz came waddling up the path between Amalia's petunias
one day, out of breath from her efforts, to tell the news. Rose
Schaffer had gone to Omaha to learn to be a nurse, although Anna
was dubious over what one can learn about it.</p>
<p>"You are a nurse or you are not," she said in German to
Amalia. "Augusta Schaffer, Rose's grandmother, was a natural
nurse. What can a young upstart like Rose learn that God does not
give you?"</p>
<p>"Augusta lost babies sometimes when she helped," Amalia said,
also in German.</p>
<p>But Anna Kratz settled that question easily: "It was God's
will."</p>
<p>By this time Amalia could see that Myrtie's fragility and her
ethereal beauty were misleading, for she began guiding all the
destinies of the farm. Whenever the occasion demanded, she could
wind Joe around her little finger by any one of the simple
processes of wheedling baby-talk or big childish tears or an
imitation of hysteria.</p>
<p>One afternoon in the summer when she and Joe had returned from
town, she came over to the little house. Amalia saw her picking
her way daintily through the bluegrass path under the apple trees
past the big lilac bushes, then the petunia-bordered path.</p>
<p>"I've got a big piece of news for you, Grandma." She was
excited, sparkling, clapping her hands like a child. Already
Amalia had learned that Myrtie was always gracious for a little
while after things had gone her way.</p>
<p>Amalia stood in the center of the little sitting-room, a
broom-straw and pot holder poised in her hand from testing her
<i>Kuchen,</i> awaiting the news.</p>
<p>"What do you think? Your name isn't Holmsdorfer any more.
You'll never have to be saddled with that old German name again.
It's just Holms. You're Mrs. Amalia Holms. We had it changed . .
. in the courts. Joe and I. We're Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Rhoden . .
. not Rhodenbach but Rhoden. . . . Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Rhoden
Holms."</p>
<p>Amalia looked dazed. She called to Fritz to come in and help
her interpret this astounding thing. Fritz stood timidly in the
background, looking at the floor, as he always did before Myrtie.
Amalia asked about it again, as though she could not understand
the calamitous thing that had happened. You couldn't change your
name like your dress.</p>
<p>When Myrtie explained some more that she had always been
ashamed of the big long name and had Joe change it, and that
Amalia was Mrs. Holms too, Amalia only stood and shook her head,
so that Myrtie lost her graciousness and stamped her foot because
of Grandma's stubbornness, and said: "You wouldn't be so dumb as
that I hope."</p>
<p>But Amalia was firm. "You . . . <i>vielleicht</i> . . . maybe
. . . Myrtie, you and Joe. But not me."</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c28" id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The gay nineties had their good points in the growing city of
Lincoln where Matthias Meier lived with Ida and his son Carter.
For one thing, the bank in which he was vice-president had
blossomed forth in electric lighting. The old horses on the
street-cars were turned out to pasture and some of Mr. Edison's
discovery took their place. There was a very grand new hotel
built called The Lincoln. Matthias helped organize a Board of
Trade and Ida a Woman's Club. University registration almost
reached the unbelievable figure of two thousand. The first
automobile honked its noisy way down "O" Street, a large portion
of its innards immodestly exposed to view.</p>
<p>Matthias, Ida and Carter went to the World's Fair in Chicago,
returning with souvenir spoons, much Mexican drawn work, and
pictures of Mrs. Potter Palmer and the Ferris wheel.</p>
<p>Upon her return Ida found the salt water pool in the new
hospital opened to the public, and having been brought up on the
Atlantic shore she took a great deal of pleasure in joining
society around the huge affair. She had an entirely new outfit
for the occasion,--a navy blue flannel suit gathered becomingly
just below the knees with wide ruffles, the waist even cut a bit
away from the neck, and the prettiest sort of gathered cap over
her large head of hair, also finished in a wide rubber ruffle.
With this, naturally, she wore her thigh-high lisle stockings
into the water. One in her position had an example to set for the
young ladies of the social set who were sometimes in these modern
times threatening to leave off their hose when they swam.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the nineties there was drouth, and because
nearly all crops were failures, the effect threw its shadow over
all business. Settlers out on the prairie lived on what they had
saved the year before, and Matthias Meier's bank drew on its
reserve,--both rather like camels living on their humps.</p>
<p>There was a panic in 1893 and Matthias and his fellow officers
figuratively bailed water night and day to keep the bank afloat.
As though that were not enough to bear, the next year a hot
seething wind blew across the midwest and again ruined crops.</p>
<p>By 1896 the state was represented for the first time in a race
for the presidency. The platforms created a general upheaval in
the country. Gold democrats were bolting and rallying around
William McKinley,--silver republicans were bolting and rallying
around Matthias' friend, William Jennings Bryan. It gave Nebraska
its first but not last political attention. Matthias himself had
dipped into politics as far as the state legislature where he was
responsible for one or two of the most important bills of the
times. Sometimes he cast a speculative eye toward Washington, but
"I better stay here and saw wood," he said to Ida,--and then
laughed with her that he might not have had any other choice.</p>
<p>Between the years of 1898 and 1902 Carter was in the
University,--one of the rather popular young bloods; when he
graduated, he stepped immediately into the bank of which his
father was a vice-president and told every one that fellows who
said it was hard to find jobs had bats in their belfry.</p>
<p>At twenty-seven he was married to Miss Lucile Bondurant,
daughter of one of the other vice-presidents, at an elaborate
church wedding. They went to Atlantic City on their honeymoon,
and upon their return moved at once to their new home in Cedar
City, a nice growing town in another county.</p>
<p>All this was by way of being something of a cataclysm to
Matthias and Ida. But Carter, having evinced a great desire to
run a bank himself and "run it right," had argued long and
volubly before his marriage that he could never have matters his
own way in this present job with a group of middle-aged men ahead
of him to say nothing of several of their sons.</p>
<p>It had its points, Matthias agreed with him,--helped him
purchase the controlling stock in the State Bank of Cedar City,
sent him on his way with trepidation successfully concealed,
remembering the days of his own ventures in a country that was
raw and unsettled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c29" id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything seemed different to Amalia at the farm since the
coming of Myrtie. Sometimes she had a feeling that she and Fritz
were visiting here or perhaps living on charity,--a queer enough
feeling, too, when you stopped to think that the first two
homesteads had belonged to Wilhelm, her father, and to Herman,
her husband, and that only the newest eighty had been purchased
by Joe's father from the Kratzes.</p>
<p>Life at the big house was so different now that she and Fritz
did not go over very often. Myrtie was expecting a child and was
so changeable in her moods. Sometimes she grew restless and had
Joe take her to town every day. Sometimes she said she was
nervous and would shut herself in her bedroom, not answering when
Joe tapped on the door to ask what he could do for her. She did
no work at all, having May Gebhardt there to keep house.</p>
<p>Amalia tried to smooth it over with Joe. He dropped in at the
little house every day now and Amalia would laugh at his worries.
Myrtie was all right. That was the way they always acted. But
Amalia knew she was fibbing in order to bring oil to troubled
waters,--knew that was not the way she had acted long ago, being
so busy making garden and cooking and baking, washing and ironing
and cleaning. It was not the way Anna Marie had acted, cheerful
and laughing good-naturedly at her own shapelessness, pleased
that she was bringing life into the world, heart-broken those
times she could not carry her babies.</p>
<p>But she would soothe Joe, and feed him cookies from the old
stone jar, so that he would leave whistling.</p>
<p>She could see that he was patience itself. Looking at him so
eager to please and so willing to do everything Myrtie asked,
Amalia wondered sometimes if he would ever tire of that babyish
petulance, ever break over the traces and throw patience to the
winds. When the time drew near, he paid the trained nurse to come
much sooner than necessary so Myrtie would not worry. When she
constantly wanted the doctor, too, and the nurse said there was
no need, she cried hysterically and would not eat. Joe was quite
beside himself with alarm. And Amalia comforted him, but even
while she did so, she was remembering the wind and the shaking
cabin, the loneliness at the birth of her child, and the sound of
the coyotes howling.</p>
<p>The baby was born in September,--a boy, normal and husky, his
sturdy little limbs a joy to see. They named him Neal, and Joe
was as proud of him as a turkey-cock. Amalia could not comprehend
that she was a great-grandmother. Because she and her son and her
grandson had all been married at early ages, she was a
great-grandmother at sixty-three.</p>
<p>And now, soon, life took on something of its old interest, for
by the time Neal was three, Amalia was having much of the care of
him. Joe took the little fellow with him on short journeys to the
timber or barn or cornfield, and Fritz did likewise, so that it
relieved Myrtie of a great deal of responsibility. She had many
interests outside her home by that time, belonging as she did to
so many organizations in town for the betterment of her mind, and
one or two for her soul. It necessitated having a woman for
housework and a second girl occasionally, even though Amalia took
so much care of Neal. But it was a little hard to run the house
as it had always been done, for there were guests out from town
so often that the girls seemed never able to accomplish anything
excepting to prepare for entertaining. As a consequence, the
birds took the cherries, plums rotted on the ground, and apples
turned to sour mash. But Myrtie said it didn't matter, now that
one could conveniently get canned fruit and jellies in the
stores.</p>
<p>She had a discontented droop to her pretty mouth much of the
time now. Joe bought an automobile for her,--a fine red
four-cylinder affair with top and lamps and windshield included,
which materially increased her trips to town, but inasmuch as she
never learned to drive it, Joe had to come in from the field
almost every day to take her and once more to get her. As she
insisted on his clothes being changed each time, this had its
disadvantage from the standpoint of the farm work, so that he was
obliged to take on another hired man.</p>
<p>When Neal was six, Myrtie was made secretary of a lodge in
Westville so she bought a man-sized desk for her clerical work
and turned Joe's and her bedroom into a semi-office. The desk
just fitted into the corner where Joe's share of the twin beds
stood so she retained only her own and put Joe and Neal upstairs.
As Myrtie said, it was a very satisfactory arrangement for
sometimes she liked to work late at her desk and then sleep late
in the morning.</p>
<p>To Amalia, seventy now, fell even more of the care of Neal.
But Amalia loved it. Even though she was old and tired, she loved
it. What would life have been to her without this lively little
boy? It was now as though she had her third son. Emil . . . Joey
. . . Neal. Sometimes when he trudged by her side chattering so
gaily, she caught herself thinking that which was not right and
which she straightway corrected in her mind,--that of all three
she loved him most.</p>
<p>Never had she seen so happy a child. Remembering Myrtie's
pouting and her nervousness, old Amalia wondered how this had
come to pass. One would have expected him to be cross, selfish,
discontented. He was none of these. Everything tickled him, the
dog running after a jack-rabbit, the martins frightening the
sparrows, old Fritz dropping his upper teeth when he was in the
corncrib. Neal's smile was always sunny. His laughter rang out at
the slightest provocation. How could this be?</p>
<p>Myrtie's love for him took on a queer expression for a mother.
Apparently it consisted for the most part in wanting him to be
talented and courteous and to show off before her friends. Amalia
could not put her finger on the queer quality of it, excepting
that whatever he was doing openly and however he was appearing
seemed to be of more importance to her than that which lay behind
these external qualities.</p>
<p>Sensing this, Amalia bent all the time of her contacts with
him to these very things which Myrtie passed over so casually.
She made him go all the way back to old Anna Kratz's to return a
small and unimportant wheel he had brought from there without
asking about it. She labored a half day with him to get him to
tell that he had taken fruit <i>Kuchen</i> from her pantry,
caring not in the least for the <i>Kuchen</i> but only that he
should be honest.</p>
<p>Together they walked in the timberland even as she had walked
with the little boy's father and his grandfather,--not buoyantly
now, but slowly for her seventy years. She talked to him of the
trees, old now like Amalia herself,--the hoary old cottonwoods
and willow and ash and the great thickly knotted clumps of wild
sumac. Because it was too hard for her to stoop, Neal picked and
brought to her the violets and black-eyed Susans and trillium,
the bellwort and bloodroot and wild columbine. But it was only
the English names of these that Neal knew, for not one word of
German could he say but <i>"Ich liebe dich"</i> which Amalia had
taught him was "I love you."</p>
<p>Together they found the meadow-lark's nest in the grass and
the place where the owls had hooted away the nights in the woods
these fifty years. She stood with him on the church knoll with
its fine brick buildings and well-kept cemetery behind iron gates
looking over the valley, and had him repeat with her,--she in
German and he in the English,--the psalm of walking through the
valley of the shadow of death and yet fearing no evil.</p>
<p>And this time Fritz was not here to make any comment, either
to tell her that she would make a softie of the little boy as he
had when she instructed Emil so, or to admit that it is not
softness to be tender as he had with Joey. For old Fritz,
himself, was lying back there now behind the wrought-iron gates.
Old Fritz, himself, the year before, had walked through the
valley of the shadow of death, fearing evil for a time, until
Amalia by his bedside, holding his gnarled old hand and thanking
him for having been such a good brother to her, made him fear no
more.</p>
<p>It was lonely these days without Fritz, but much of the time
it seemed to Amalia he had not gone away at all. When she was
baking she often forgot and let a pan of <i>Kuchen</i> get
browner because he liked it so, and very often, unthinking, she
set the table for two.</p>
<p>But Neal, dashing in then, full of life and laughter and
staying to use the other place, would drive the loneliness away
and fill her heart with happiness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c30" id="c30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It was this year of 1917 that strange things came to pass.</p>
<p>The country was at war. Amalia remembered the news of the
Civil War when she was twelve, the drafting of several of the men
in the neighborhood, the great pride the Illinois people had
taken that old Abe was in the presidential chair, the company
coming home when she was sixteen.</p>
<p>It had seemed unbelievable that war could touch her again.
Even the Spanish-American War of which she had heard had been
unreal, for no one from the immediate neighborhood had gone.
There were three brave Nebraska regiments, they had told
her,--one had gone to the Philippine Islands, wherever they
were,--one to Tennessee, and one had crossed to Havana.</p>
<p>But this war was so different. It was coming into the
neighborhood. It was asking for the young men. It was making
trouble,--was causing bad feelings right here between old
neighbors.</p>
<p>There could be no more German in the church on the hill. It
must all be English,--not a song, not a sermon, not a psalm could
be in the old tongue. Tsk! Tsk! How could one sit through and
understand it all? How could it harm the country to say the
Psalms in the German?</p>
<p>The <i>pastor</i> had been told to leave, had been given a few
days to get out of the neighborhood for making wrong statements.
Anna Kratz came over every day now to talk. Almost in a whisper
Anna talked to her in the German, looking about furtively as
though the walls might have ears. Adolph had been in town, he and
Karl Schaffer and Henry Gebhardt had been talking on the corner
about the war; some men had come up to them and said to cut it
out, meaning, so Adolph said, to speak no more in the German
tongue.</p>
<p>Worst of all Myrtie made more trouble. She talked constantly
to Joe about the relatives, put strange notions into Neal's
little head so that he said: "Grandma, you shall say no more
German words to me ever. I am ashamed of them."</p>
<p>"Not even <i>'Ich liebe dich'?"</i></p>
<p>"No, it is not nice."</p>
<p>When the Christmas exercises were held in the church and they
sang "Silent Night, Holy Night," Amalia hummed the song below her
breath but with no words at all, for the English were too
difficult and with the German she did not dare.</p>
<p>Oh, it was a trying time. Sometimes Amalia was wishing with
all her might that Fritz were here to talk the queer situation
over with her. Then, remembering Fritz's hard time with the
English and the things some of the neighbors were saying, she was
glad he was not here to be hurt.</p>
<p>Joe was irritable. Not even the high price he was getting for
wheat--so much money--could pay him for the mean way he felt,
torn by his loyalty to the oldest of the Kratz and Gebhardt and
Rhodenbach people and by the harsh things Myrtie and her friends
were saying.</p>
<p>And then he was drafted and Amalia and Myrtie were drawn
together for a time by their common fright. But the scare went
into nothing when the lawyer filled out the answers to the
questions that Joe was sole manager of four hundred acres of farm
land and must stay home to attend to raising the wheat.</p>
<p>Rose Schaffer was one of the first to go over-seas.</p>
<p>One of Karl Schaffer's boys died of pneumonia in camp. A
Gebhardt boy was killed in France. Elsa Rhodenbach, who was a
widow living in town now, had two sons leave the same morning
together. Elsa got breakfast for them, said good-by, walked out
of the house when they did, and never went back. All summer
children used to stand on their tiptoes and peek through the
woodbine covering the windows, seeing the dishes there on the
table, the unmade beds with the boys' shoes under them and their
ties and night-clothes thrown across the backs of chairs.</p>
<p>It was over at last,--the war. The whistles blew in town that
it was over, and the train coming through, shrieked its way all
across the countryside, through the villages and past the fields
which had raised so much of the wheat for the armies. The bell in
the tower of the big brick church on the knoll, rang, too, for in
what language does a bell worship or toll or carol?</p>
<p>It was over for the neighborhood,--all but the scars left by
the things that had been said, and for the fact that the Gebhardt
boy and Karl Schaffer's boy did not come back, and neither did
Elsa Rhodenbach's sanity. Over, excepting for all of these things
and a wild aftermath of economic and moral breakdown that swept
into every village and farm.</p>
<p>Joe was making a good deal of money these days. His car was
big and new, six cylinders now. The land brought in such good
returns that he was anxious to get more. Myrtie was having a
great many very nice things; clothes and company and a trip to
Chicago with friends. She was back home now but so busy with
several social affairs that Neal was still at Amalia's.</p>
<p>To-night while his parents were away, he was making a crude
little boat in Amalia's kitchen . . . pound . . . pound . . .
with Amalia sitting near looking over <i>reis</i> for to-morrow
and watching him. Seventy-one she was. Did a woman never outgrow
her motherliness? Neal was her little boy just as Emil and Joey
had been. Emil . . . Joey . . . Neal! Son . . . grandson . . .
great-grandson. The years had all run together so that they
seemed three brothers with no great difference in their ages.
Three little brothers, and she the mother of them all. How could
it be like that?</p>
<p>Neal dropped his hammer now and leaned back against the wall
for a time, eyes drooping and hands listless. Even as she was
peering questioningly at him, he came languidly over to her. "I
don't feel so good, Grandma."</p>
<p>She had him in her lap, was feeling his hot face, his rapid
pulse.</p>
<p>"I'll say, <i>'Ich liebe dich'</i> Grandma, if you want me to.
It is not bad. It is just as good as 'I love you.'"</p>
<p>"Oh, Neal-<i>liebling."</i> She pulled him to her, frightened
at the premonition of a sickness for him. And he did not even
rebel at the endearing word she had said to a big boy of
eight.</p>
<p>Old Amalia kept clean night-clothes here in her house for Neal
because she had him here so much,--a queer word they called them,
pajamas. She never could remember to say it,--"night panties" she
called them instead. She got out his night panties now and got
him into them, her fingers stiff and slow but tender as always.
Already he was dozing, shivering a little, too, and rousing to
whimper. She covered him, got drinks for him, sat by the bed,
comforting him.</p>
<p>It was late when she heard the automobile come into the yard.
Joe would be down in a few minutes. He never failed to come down
to see if everything was all right, whether to leave the little
boy or carry him up home. Joe was a good father. Sometimes she
thought he was father and mother both. In bearing Neal, Myrtie
had apparently paid off most of her obligations to
motherhood.</p>
<p>When she told him about Neal, he was at the bed in a second
bending over his little son. Then out again for the doctor the
moment he had seen his flushed face and how he was thrashing
about.</p>
<p>Spanish influenza they called it, and it went through the
country like the prairie-fires of the old days. People dropped
over at their work,--young Mrs. Henry Kratz was frying chicken,
fainted, was buried the third day with no one allowed to attend
the funeral. A sixteen-year-old boy died, a sixty-year-old woman,
a baby,--the whole countryside was panicky.</p>
<p>Myrtie's hired girl took it, then Myrtie.</p>
<p>Joe was beside himself with worry and sleeplessness. He phoned
to Westville for a trained nurse, to Lincoln, to Omaha. None was
available. They said they would put him on the list but gave no
hope for immediate relief. He plodded between the two houses,
staggered almost with loss of sleep.</p>
<p>Old Amalia did everything for Neal the doctor said to do, but
with her intuition she sensed he was not confident about his own
orders. She carried out his orders fully, adding a few
old-fashioned cures of her own, <i>Flieder-tee</i> and
<i>Pfefferminz-tee.</i> She had waged a fight like this many
times for Emil and Joey,--now it was for Neal, her third little
boy.</p>
<p>It was toward evening of the fourth day when Joe, haggard,
unkempt looking, just back to the cottage from caring for Myrtie,
was standing by Neal's bed, that the door of Amalia's
sitting-room opened. Startled, they both turned to it. Rose
Schaffer stood there in a white dress and over-seas cape, a
little black satchel in her hand.</p>
<p>"Rose!" Something jumped so plainly from Joe that Amalia,
relieved as she was at Rose's coming, turned away from him in
embarrassment. As long as she lived Amalia knew she would carry
with her the memory of Joe's face when he turned and saw Rose in
the doorway. And now Amalia had this secret she must never
divulge, must never even remember. And who but old Amalia knew
what it meant to have married the wrong person?</p>
<p>"I came to help, Joe." Rose took off her hat. Her clear gray
eyes, her serene mouth, her strong capable hands,--how good she
looked!</p>
<p>"You're . . . so good, Rose." It was all he said.</p>
<p>Rose went at her work with no other explanation. Joe went out
to do his chores.</p>
<p>For two more days and nights Neal was not out of danger and
Rose scarcely took her eyes off the child. Then the fever broke
and the great sweating sapped his strength.</p>
<p>Joe coming in found Rose crying by the bedside and was almost
too frightened to speak: "He's . . . he's worse, Rose?"</p>
<p>"No . . . he's better. He'll get well if you're careful."</p>
<p>"Then why . . . are you crying?"</p>
<p>Amalia saw him start to put his arm around her and then drop
it quickly.</p>
<p>"Just . . . a sort of reaction. Silly . . . isn't it?"</p>
<p>But old Amalia, who had lived seventy-one years, knew why Rose
Schaffer was crying over Joe's little boy.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c31" id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Carter Meier and his wife Lucile had adjusted themselves ably
to conditions in the smaller town of Cedar City.</p>
<p>"The smaller the town the more often they tack on the word
'City,'" Lucile had said.</p>
<p>But Carter had called her attention to the fact that when a
town gets its baptismal name its sponsors in fancy see it
stretched out over half the county.</p>
<p>"Like babies, I suppose," Lucile said with sarcasm, "with the
mother always thinking her youngster is to be president or the
first lady."</p>
<p>In 1913 Lucile herself had no sarcasm for the situation, but
very frankly admitted that her baby was an eligible candidate for
the first lady's place. The child had dark red ringlets, creamy
petaled skin and hazel eyes. They named her Hazel, but Matthias
sometimes facetiously called his only grandchild "Reddie."</p>
<p>He and Ida took their honors solemnly. Because Carter had not
been born until they were thirty-five and thirty-two,--and
because the child Hazel did not arrive until Carter and Lucile
had been married for six years,--it followed that Matthias and
Ida were well along in years,--sixty-eight and
sixty-five,--before they experienced this ownership of a
grandchild. It was almost overwhelming.</p>
<p>They drove out to Cedar City at the least possible excuse,
taking advantage of every national holiday, every birthday, and
even, so Ida said, April Fool and Columbus Day.</p>
<p>Matthias was out of active business now. He looked after his
property, advised Carter on any and all matters that came up in
the Cedar City bank of which he owned some stock. Once he and Ida
had been abroad, several times to Florida and California.</p>
<p>Ida, at sixty-five, looked the part of an amiable
duchess,--snow-white hair in a becoming coiffure, solid pink
cheeks, her heavy figure straight and trim in its hard stays. Her
word had weight in the Woman's Club,--church organizations asked
her to make decisions, every charity included her name.</p>
<p>Matthias, too, was straight as an Indian, his shovel-shaped
black beard of the old days white-washed by the years and trimmed
down to Scotch-like closeness.</p>
<p>They belonged to the Country Club, ten years old now. Matthias
swung a mean club in the newly introduced game of golf, and Ida
could hold her own at the card table. Sometimes they laughed at
the old days. "Imagine how I used to play croquet in a long
trailing skirt!" or "How I ever had the nerve to sing in a choir
. . . !" And then quite often the statements would be followed by
"Just the same they were the good old days," spoken together like
the chorus of a song which they both knew.</p>
<p>The child Hazel could not, if she were able, have chosen more
satisfactory grandparents.</p>
<p>Carter's business was good. The State Bank of Cedar City was
paying ample dividends spring and fall. Matthias admitted his son
had used his head when he went into the smaller bank on his own.
His success made Carter Meier rather unsympathetic with failure
of any sort. One did with life as one wished. Or so he
thought.</p>
<p>Lucile had everything to make life comfortable for
her,--sufficient clothes for the exigencies of the small town and
for the times when she would go to Lincoln to be entertained by
her own people or Father and Mother Meier,--a nice home, plenty
of help, her own car, a healthy and attractive little
daughter.</p>
<p>Carter worked day and night during the World War,--his own
business in the daytime, war work at night,--questionnaires and
applications for release from the draft for the farm boys. He was
a part and parcel of the smaller town as his father had been of
the small Lincoln, grown by this time to fifty thousand
people.</p>
<p>To the west twenty million acres of sandy soil held fast to
the earth's breast by coarse, tough grasses since the glacial
period were being loosened by plows to feed a fighting
Europe.</p>
<p>It was easy planting. No forests to fell, few stones to
remove. Peel open the top soil with a plow, seed it, scratch it
with a harrow, and Mother Nature did the rest. As the crops went
in, the soil grew finer, became more powder-like.</p>
<p>A few shook their heads at the unthinking procedure. Once when
old Charlie Briggs dropped into Cedar City to see Carter, his old
friend's son, and a bit of fine dust was coming through the air
on the wings of the west wind, old Charlie lifted his head like a
fire-horse and sniffed.</p>
<p>"Dirt from the Panhandle," he said. "Powder, that's what the
ground is being pulverized into. It might turn into gunpowder one
of these days. A body can't tell. Wheat may get to be scarce.
Bread might be a luxury right here in the heart of our own
country. Ain't I heard somepin' about a French Revolution
startin' over a bread riot?"</p>
<p>Carter Meier laughed a lot about old Charlie Briggs and his
ideas.</p>
<p>In 1919 with Spanish influenza sweeping the country, Ida Meier
died suddenly in her Lincoln home. Only four days of sickness,
and with Matthias employing every means at his command,--doctors,
specialists, nurses, oxygen,--she slipped away.</p>
<p>He was too stunned to comprehend. Why, Ida was a part of him.
She was one of his hands, one of his feet, one side of his mind,
half of his heart. If Ida was dead, that meant half of him was
dead.</p>
<p>But he pulled himself together, lived on, imposed his feelings
of loss on no one. He sold the old home to the Pi Beta
Chis,--when some of the "actives" came in to look it over, closed
his ears to their merry quips about the ornate grill-work through
which they could hang their neckties, and how they would play
checkers on the inlaid woods of the entrance hall. Still, Ida
would have laughed merrily if she could hear their humorous
sallies. All right, he would laugh too, then.</p>
<p>He moved over to Cedar City to be near Carter and Lucile. They
built a larger house so he could have his own suite of rooms. He
went down to Carter's bank every day. Carter depended a great
deal on his judgment.</p>
<p>Hazel was Matthias' comfort. He watched her
grow,--eight--ten--twelve--fourteen. How the years rolled on. She
was not quite so pretty now,--her hair was lovely, but she was at
the gangling age,--a brace on her teeth, freckles on her nose.
The former would come off in time,--it was questionable about the
other.</p>
<p>She was athletic,--always on roller skates, ice skates, a
bicycle. A tennis racket was her insignia,--"I can beat you" her
life's motto. She went hither and yon with the wind. Sometimes he
tried to take a hand and tame her down,--tell her that she would
soon be a young lady, that ladies should be more demure, that the
young men cared more for that kind, and how could she expect to
have any young man ever care for her?</p>
<p>"But I don't <i>want</i> any young man to care for me," she
would respond. "It would just drive me <i>nuts.</i> I'm going to
be the champion swimmer--or a circus woman--or maybe fly in a
plane."</p>
<p>Whatever could you do with a young girl like that? Such times
as these were. No modesty, no womanly graces.</p>
<p>Fairly often old Charlie Briggs came to see Matthias. Lucile
and Carter laughed a little at the old codger.</p>
<p>"Whatever Father can see in him, with his long-drawn tales of
the 'airly days,'" Lucile would say.</p>
<p>"Search me," Carter would respond indifferently. "With all
Father's travel and culture, I believe he hangs more on every
word that old fellow says than any one I know."</p>
<p>But Hazel always stood up stoutly for him. "I like him. He's a
nice old man. He shot an Injun once right in the belly when the
Injun was trying to slip up on him."</p>
<p>"Hazel . . . how terrible! Why do you listen to all that gore?
Anyway, it's Indian, not Injun. And do, for pity's sake, say he
hit him in the stomach if you <i>have</i> to say it at all."</p>
<p>"Charlie Briggs says it's Injun. And your stomach <i>isn't</i>
your belly. Your belly . . ."</p>
<p>"Hazel. That will do."</p>
<p>". . . is below your stomach."</p>
<p>"Hazel. Do you hear me?"</p>
<p>"Anyway he knows more about our own history than anybody. He
knows all about the Vigilantes hanging the horse thieves in
summer 'til the crows pecked their eyes out . . . and about
sticking them down through ice holes in the winter."</p>
<p>"Oh, Hazel, you have such a delicate sense of the
æsthetic."</p>
<p>"And I'm going some day to see where old Charlie Briggs and
Grandpa got off the boat at Nebraska City . . . and John Brown's
cave where he hid the runaway slaves. And Charlie Briggs can show
me yet, he says, where the overland trails all began. He bets he
can find ruts some places yet where the wheels of the prairie
schooners cut. I can go, can't I, Dad?"</p>
<p>"Sure. Anybody as history-conscious as that ought to be
allowed to poke around a bit."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c32" id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Times had changed again slowly. The highway was hard packed
with gravel. The Evergreen School was closed and a bus came by
daily to take Neal and the other pupils into town. When Amalia
got out Joe's tin bucket that she had saved carefully and offered
to put up Neal's lunch for him every day, thinking how much
pleasure it would give her, he rolled on the floor in his
mirth.</p>
<p>"Grandma, you are so behind the times. Don't you know I buy a
hot lunch in the cafeteria?"</p>
<p>"In de calf . . ."</p>
<p>"Cafeteria . . . where you can buy the food you choose to
eat,--soup and hot meat and potatoes and salads,--a balanced meal
to keep you healthy."</p>
<p>Tsk! Tsk! And the cold <i>Mettwurst</i> and the
<i>Sckinken</i> and the <i>Kornbrot</i> and <i>Apfelbutter</i>
she had put up so many times! And who had been more healthy than
Emil and Joe?</p>
<p>There were other things about which Neal laughed
hilariously.</p>
<p>Once she asked him hesitatingly,--for perhaps, already she
knew his answer,--"Neal, vould you . . . vouldn't you like to be
a <i>pastor?"</i></p>
<p>Giving it, as she did, the emphasis on the second syllable in
the German way, Neal was not sure of her word.</p>
<p>"Pas<i>tor</i>? You mean a preacher?"</p>
<p>"So. A preacher."</p>
<p>Neal rolled then on the floor in mirth and shouted. "A
preacher! All I would like about that is being invited to all the
big dinners in the country."</p>
<p>No, there was no use. No one of her three boys a <i>pastor</i>
would be.</p>
<p>Myrtie's latest argument with Joe these days was that he
should get out of the hog business altogether and depend only on
selling his crops.</p>
<p>Joe groaned when she began, for never since their marriage had
Myrtie dropped a subject upon which she had once set her
mind.</p>
<p>The grain from four hundred acres would bring ample income,
she said, and pigs were such dirty things,--you could hear their
grunting and squealing away up at the house, too, company or no
company.</p>
<p>At first Joe only made joking answers, that he'd have some one
in to instruct them at their eating, that the day Mrs. Meredith,
the banker's wife, and the lodge ladies came out from town, he
would speak to the old porkers himself.</p>
<p>But Myrtie would not joke. She ran instead the full gamut of
her little tricks,--teasing, baby-talk, wheedling, tears,
hysteria. It was not often that she had to go so far, but Joe set
a good deal of store by his Berkshires, and it required her
entire bag of tricks before he capitulated.</p>
<p>After the hogs went, she began on Joe about the chickens. She
said eggs were so cheap it was foolish to look after those
chickens and cackling hens every day, and when they wanted one to
eat, Grandma would let them have one of hers.</p>
<p>So they, too, went,--and the farm was exactly like a town home
with its nice sloping lawn, no pigs or chickens on the place, and
Joe, dressed up, driving the car up to the side porch whenever
Myrtie called.</p>
<p>As there were no pigs or chickens to be fed, there was no mash
to be cooked. So Myrtie told one of the hired men to scrub up the
old soap-kettle, paint it copper-colored, fill it with dirt and
bring it onto the front lawn. There she had him cross three stout
hickory sticks in camp-fire style and hang the kettle on them by
a gilded chain. Then she had the hired girl plant white
snow-on-the-mountain in it, and red geraniums under it. And
people coming out from town said it looked cute, just as though
there were fire under it and steam coming out of it.</p>
<p>Only old Amalia, standing in the doorway of her small house,
shading her watery eyes from the sunlight to see the finished
article, failed to think it looked cute. She thought the old
kettle looked out of place and a little silly.</p>
<p>By the time Neal was through the grammar grades and ready for
High School in the fall of 1926, Myrtie's desires took on more
radical form. Specifically,--she wanted Joe to retire.</p>
<p>"Retire?" Joe laughed heartily at that one. That one should be
in the funny column, he said,--maybe in the department called
"Slips That Pass in the Night."</p>
<p>When Myrtie would not laugh, but persisted day after day in
referring to a potential retirement, Joe grew irritated. It was
too foolish to waste one's breath on it.</p>
<p>"Retire? Say, what do you take me for?"</p>
<p>"Yes . . . retire." Myrtie's little rosebud mouth set in a
straight and stubborn line.</p>
<p>"Can you beat it for a cracked idea? Retire when you're
thirty-eight."</p>
<p>"Age hasn't anything to do with it,--if you're able
financially to retire at thirty-eight."</p>
<p>"But I'm not."</p>
<p>"Oh, you just think you're not. Just that old
Holms<i>dorfer</i> idea that you have to hoard." The accent on
the <i>dorfer</i> which had been dropped and the slur which it
implied angered Joe more than Myrtie had ever seen him angry.</p>
<p>"See here, a Holms<i>dorfer</i> was good enough for you to
want to marry. And you leave the old folks out of this. If you
and I are ever half as good as . . ." He caught himself, said
more evenly: "I don't call it hoarding to earn your living by
hard work so you can have something to depend on in your old
age."</p>
<p>"You'll have plenty, never fear."</p>
<p>"Not if I quit while I'm still a young man, I won't. And don't
forget that last eighty from the Gebhardts,--costing twenty
thousand dollars because the improvements were extra good,--five
thousand only paid, only two really which was cash, the bank
holding a seven thousand note of mine, Henry Gebhardt an eleven
thousand mortgage. That sounds like retirement in a pig's left
eye. Oh, excuse me for mentioning pigs."</p>
<p>And when Myrtie's little mouth trembled and she looked
misty-eyed, he asked querulously: "Retire . . .
<i>where?"</i></p>
<p>"Over to Westville of course, or even to Lincoln."</p>
<p>"In <i>town?"</i> Joe was really disturbed.</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"But I wouldn't <i>like</i> it, Myrtie. I'm a farmer. My
father . . . and my father's father and <i>his</i> father . . .
maybe back to Adam for all I know were <i>land</i> people. It's
my <i>work . . .</i> my <i>life."</i></p>
<p>"There's a lot more to life than a farm."</p>
<p>"I know it. I want to get things running here smoothly so we
can take a good trip every year. Canada . . . I'd like to see
those real wheat farms, . . . California, maybe, . . . the old
Spanish ranchos I've heard about. . . ."</p>
<p>"Farms . . . ranchos." Myrtie said it in the same tone one
would speak of tarantulas and scorpions.</p>
<p>"Then there's Neal," he went on. "He's to be thought of."</p>
<p>"How do you mean . . . 'thought of'?"</p>
<p>"Why, that everything shall be in tip-top shape for him."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"'Where?' Why, <i>here."</i></p>
<p>"Neal will have something to say about that."</p>
<p>"Of course, and he'll say the right thing, too. Natural-born
farmer . . . look at his 4-H Club work . . . his calf
prizes."</p>
<p>At that Myrtie would walk into her own room and close the
door.</p>
<p>But a mere walking off by no means closed the argument.</p>
<p>It went on many times after that. Sometimes Myrtie was quietly
insistent about it, sometimes she was tearful, and always she
kept it over Joe's head. Sometimes she said Joe ought to be
generous enough to do it for her after all she'd been through, at
which Joe could scarcely restrain himself against asking just
what that had been. Sometimes she remarked that he was blind not
to see it was for his own good. Often she said it was too bad
that he couldn't do that much for his only son.</p>
<p>At that Joe would explode: "My only son's a spoiled kid with
everything in the world from his first little velocipede on
through town school,--a boy's camp,--asking for his own car at
fifteen now,--the promise of one on his sixteenth birthday. At
his age I was up at five with my dad, doing my share of chores. .
. ."</p>
<p>That would be about the point where Myrtie would cry and take
a headache tablet.</p>
<p>Joe, dropping down sometimes on the steps of the old home and
looking across the long sloping lawn to the paved highway and his
fields beyond, lush with purple alfalfa, to the corn lands and
the pastures, and his sleek cattle, tried to think how any one
would want to live anywhere else.</p>
<p>He worked hard, of course, but who didn't? Lots of
discouraging things,--bad crops, hail, prices slumping, one
battle after another with chinch bugs or blight or cut-worms. If
it wasn't one thing it was another. But wherever you were or
whatever you did there was always something. He bet even the
banker had his troubles. He'd rather battle his enemies out here
in the open.</p>
<p>Sometimes he thought of Rose Schaffer. At first he had put her
from his thoughts as disloyal to Myrtie about whom he had once
gone off his head. Then, he didn't care whether it was disloyal
or not. He liked to think about her. How contented Rose would
have been on a fine farm and how efficiently she would have
managed. Oh well, she was probably doing just what she was cut
out for,--head nurse or some such title in one of the Omaha
hospitals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now Amalia was seventy-nine, tiny and weather-beaten, her
hair in a hard little knob like a walnut, her skin a network of
wrinkles, deep rivers on the map of Time.</p>
<p>This was the spring that with Joe, Myrtie, and Neal she took
the long drive one Sunday to Nebraska City to visit Arbor Lodge,
the beautiful old estate of J. Sterling Morton, now a state
park.</p>
<p>All the buds were unfolding under the soft warmth of the sun.
There was a smell of burning leaves. Tulips were pushing up
through the warm ground. Odors from recently turned earth still
lingered in the air. The old grounds were lovely in their new
spring growth.</p>
<p>Not once had Amalia ever returned to Nebraska City since the
day she stepped from the ferry and found Herman waiting.
Sixty-one years.</p>
<p>They were to eat their lunch here under the trees so Myrtie
said. Joe said they would drive down toward the town afterward so
Grandma could try and find the place where she stood by the
overland trail when she was married to Grandpa.</p>
<p>It was the first time Neal had ever been told about it. He
thought that was just about the darnedest thing he'd ever heard.
"What do you know about that, Grandma? Married outdoors! And
standing by the wagons on an overland trail! Well . . . I'll be .
. . Say, you could have sung 'It's a Long, Long Trail A-Winding,'
couldn't you?" And he rolled on the pine needles in one of his
moments of mirth.</p>
<p>They spread their lunch on a cloth under the pine trees
growing on a portion of the grounds. The mansion was visible
through the trees, the snowy white pillars of one of its three
great rounded porches glistening in the spring sunshine. Here,
somewhere, perhaps even where the lunch cloth lay, was held the
ceremony in which the Indians made the treaty with the whites,
signing away all their rights to Nebraska Territory. Joe said
there was a large oil painting of the ceremony in the house, on
the landing of the great stairway,--that they could see it when
they would go in later.</p>
<p>There were several other groups in the grove. Myrtie was
hoping that it was no one she knew, for she was always a little
fearful of meeting some of her friends when she was with Grandma
who looked so queer these days.</p>
<p>Joe knew who one of the men was in the group nearest,--it was
Carter Meier, the banker over at Cedar City. He had seen him the
time he went there with Orval Black on that note. That must be
his wife and young daughter with him. Myrtie was all
interest,--they certainly looked well groomed and as though they
<i>were</i> some one.</p>
<p>"And I suppose the gentleman with the white beard is old Mr.
Matthias Meier, his father," Joe explained.</p>
<p>Amalia trembled a little with the sudden shock of the queer
thing Joey had said.</p>
<p>"What did you say his name was, Joey?"</p>
<p>"Matthias Meier. He lived in Lincoln until a few years ago.
Now he lives in Cedar City at his son's home."</p>
<p>"Joey, . . . I knew . . . I knew a man in Illinois vonce by de
name of Meier."</p>
<p>"Sure you did . . . and you'd known one if you'd lived in
Indiana or Michigan or Ohio. Pretty common, Grandma."</p>
<p>When the lunch was finished, Amalia walked over to a bench
under the trees and sat down. She wanted to think. Matthias
Meier! So often she had wondered about him. Old Amalia
Holmsdorfer in her rusty black dress and her little black bonnet
with the jet buckle sat and wondered if it could really be the
same. After a lifetime!</p>
<p>And then it happened. The tall white-haired and white-bearded
old gentleman of the group came walking down the path. Old Amalia
who could not see to read could yet see him coming. He was
straight and tall and he swung a cane rather pompously. Amalia
knew him,--by his walk and the set of his shoulders and the way
he held his head,--by her heart and by remembrance.</p>
<p>The years turned back and he was swinging off his horse . . .
coming toward her. . . . Yes, old Amalia knew him.</p>
<p>She was suddenly agitated, frightened. Her heart,--it pounded
loudly. Should she call to him to stop? Get up and walk toward
him? Should she let him know? Should she say something? Or
nothing? She sat still and blinked up at him with faded eyes.</p>
<p>If Amalia saw a fine-looking, well-preserved old gentleman,
highly groomed and prosperous appearing, Matthias Meier,
sauntering down the path, saw a queer little old woman sitting on
one of the park benches,--a brown gnome of a woman peering up at
him with pale, watery eyes. She looked like one of the peasants
of Bavaria he had seen abroad, he was thinking,--or a Breton
painting, perhaps. She looked so tiny and ancient, so picturesque
in her funny old clothes, so detached from the civilization of
to-day, that he nodded courteously to her. Yes, she belonged
there under the trees with the squirrels.</p>
<p>"Spring again," he said pleasantly to her.</p>
<p>Amalia twisted her knotted fingers together. "Yes," she said.
She tried to wet her shrunken, dry lips over her toothless gums.
It all sounded queer and strange,--but familiar, too, like a
thing one has learned long ago and never forgotten. "Dey keep
comin'."</p>
<p>"Even though we grow old," he added humorously, placing
himself humbly in her class.</p>
<p>She clung tightly to the seat, pressing her hands against the
wood,--trying to fit it all in,--the puzzle,--nodding
acquiescence to the strange thing he had said.</p>
<p>He passed on, leaving the queer-looking little old lady
sitting there nodding--nodding agreement that spring was here
even though they were old.</p>
<p>For how could young Matthias Meier once have known he was to
keep his rendezvous in such a way? And how could old Matthias
Meier know that he had not broken his promise,--that he and
Amalia had kept their tryst?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c33" id="c33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the fall of Neal's junior High School year, Joe and Myrtie
moved to Westville.</p>
<p>Myrtie chose a house on the corner of Fifteenth and Oakland
Streets,--a big brown brick and stucco. Joe tried to get her to
be satisfied with a smaller one for he reminded her many times
that Neal would be away at school in two years' time.</p>
<p>"High School was good enough for me, but Neal is to have
college. Even if he goes back to the farm as I hope he will,
he'll always have something you can't take away from him. Can't
say I ever missed it, but I'd like Neal to go."</p>
<p>Prices were high and the house cost a pretty sum of money. Joe
had to do a certain amount of juggling to arrange for its
financing, as his lawful limit had been reached at the Westville
bank.</p>
<p>He got a personal loan from Henry Kratz for a cash payment and
gave a mortgage on the new house to the original owner. When he
was going to put a mortgage on the home four hundred, he found it
tied up yet in the original owners' names, his grandfather's and
his great grandfather's homestead titles, as there had been no
settlement of the estate. Not many direct descendants could boast
of that, they told him at the courthouse,--there had been so much
changing,--but the county recorder said he would bet his last
year's hat and the one from the year before, which was the same
one, that there were more families on farms which their ancestors
homesteaded right there in that valley than in any other section
of the state.</p>
<p>It was fairly complicated but not hard to straighten,--Wilhelm
Stoltz's one-hundred-sixty acres by the laws of the state were
divided equally between Amalia and Fritz. Fritz's half at his
death became Amalia's, one-half of Herman's homestead went to
Amalia and one-half to Emil, the latter having gone <i>in
toto</i> to Joe as did also the eighty Emil had purchased later.
To sum it all up to Myrtie, Joe told her that after all, out of
the land in the farm, Grandma still owned two hundred and forty
acres of it and maybe she would have something to say about a
mortgage,--all of which seemed especially foolish to Myrtie when
Grandma was so old and didn't even care.</p>
<p>"She'd care if she'd lose it," he said grimly.</p>
<p>The town house was eventually financed and Myrtie furnished it
newly from top to bottom for she was leaving the furniture in the
stone house to the renters.</p>
<p>Whenever Joe grew blue about his finances, knowing that he was
going against all the teaching of his people,--all the traditions
of the thrifty midwestern pioneers,--reminding himself and Myrtie
that Indebtedness was an animal which ate houses for breakfast,
farms for dinner, and lunched between times on stock sandwiched
between chattel mortgages,--Myrtie would laugh it off and call
his attention to the fact that four hundred and eighty acres of
the best Nebraska farm land was worth three hundred dollars an
acre any day, which according <i>her</i> arithmetic was one
hundred and forty-four thousand dollars.</p>
<p>"We <i>think</i> it is," Joe would say, "but do we <i>know</i>
it?"</p>
<p>Another change in Joe's life came now.</p>
<p>At a little bridge party one evening at Banker Meredith's,
Myrtie, who was sitting on the davenport with Mr. Meredith before
the games started, said in her pretty pouting way that she wished
Joe could get in the banking business,--"Oh, maybe not
<i>work</i> at it but own stock and meet with the directors and
feel that he was one of the <i>business</i> men of the town."</p>
<p>Mr. Meredith looked at her a moment rather oddly, said she was
a bright little woman and he thought maybe it could be arranged.
So it came to be that Joe was allowed to buy fifty shares of
stock at the bargain price of one-hundred-sixty dollars per share
and was made fourth vice-president, which was really the very
nicest thing that could have happened to the Holms family.</p>
<p>Myrtie said that it took a woman's ambitions and intuitions
together to help a plodder like Joe get anywhere,--and it was
not, in fact, until the moratorium of 1933 several years later,
when the bank failed to reopen and Joe was assessed for twice the
amount of his stock, that Myrtie's intuitions and ambitions
appeared not to be puncture-proof.</p>
<p>But that situation had not yet arrived and these years were
prosperous ones. Joe's crops brought good prices. They bought a
larger car. Neal was to turn his old one in and get a new one the
day he would graduate.</p>
<p>So now Mrs. Joseph Rhoden Holms could launch out on what she
termed "real living." Neal went in for football and a general
good time.</p>
<p>And Joe--?</p>
<p>Joe in his early forties, miserable and uncertain just what
life was doing to him, would drive out to the farm nearly every
day and look around, "overseeing the tenants," as Myrtie
wanted.</p>
<p>But something was happening to the old home place. Spring
rains had washed out part of the corn and the renter
apologetically said he had thought there wasn't any use to
replant when it was so late. Fences were broken here and there.
The stucco was dropping off the house in large
South-American-shaped chunks. Dandelions and burdock had taken
over part of the lawn. A barn door hung by a roller. The old
soap-kettle in the yard at the side of the drive hung dejectedly
by one chain over the frozen geranium roots and with rotted
snow-on-the-mountain spilling out of it.</p>
<p>Sometimes Joe worked all day at these defects, eating his noon
meal with old Amalia. Nearly eighty she was, but fairly spry
about her house-work and as neat as ever. Her kitchen shone like
a child's scrubbed face. No one could make <i>Kaffeekuchen</i> so
well or fry chicken like Grandma.</p>
<p>It always made him feel better to talk to her. He told her
many of the things that worried him, but he never complained
about Myrtie. It did not seem square to Myrtie to discuss her
even with Grandma. Once when he was there Amalia told him Rose
Schaffer had been to see her. "In her own car . . . such a
fine-looking voman . . . wit' a fur coat."</p>
<p>He started to say something, thought better of it evidently
and did not finish.</p>
<p>Together they sat silent and embarrassed.</p>
<p>Sometimes he talked to Grandma about Neal. "Four hundred and
eighty acres of the finest Nebraska farmland there is," he said
sardonically, ". . . that's what he'll have some day and Myrtie
wants him to be a lawyer."</p>
<p>"Vell," old Amalia said cheerfully, "any lawyer can alvays use
a goot farm," and laughed at her own joke. Always she was wanting
Joe and Myrtie to get along well.</p>
<p>"If there's anything left," Joe said grimly. "I don't like the
way my debits and credits look in black and red figures."</p>
<p>Neal graduated from the Westville High School in 1929. One
could scarcely contend that it was scholarship which sent him
through with more or less flying colors. Foot-ball prowess plus a
reputation for squareness and a personality that was most
likable,--these rather were his assets. Amalia looking at him,
sometimes wondered what he had of Myrtie's excepting the cleft in
his chin and the gracious manner all the time which she showed
only when things went her way. He had something of the noisiness
of Emil, his grandfather,--the physical prowess of Herman, his
great-grandfather,--perhaps even a little of the arrogance of
Wilhelm Stoltz, his great-great-grandfather. From Amalia herself
he had several of those traits she had given him when under her
care, but that she did not see.</p>
<p>The night of the graduating exercises in the new auditorium
Joe drove out to the farm to get Amalia, eighty-one now. She was
dressed and waiting for him, and if they were both remembering
that other graduating night, neither spoke of it.</p>
<p>She had on her black dress gathered full at the waistline. Her
hair was knotted in its tight little wad on the nape of her neck.
She was as shrunken as a tiny brown mummy. There was not a tooth
in her head.</p>
<p>Seeing her so, as with newly opened eyes, Joe said suddenly:
"Grandma, I'm afraid you're getting along in years. Don't you
think you better come to town and live with us?"</p>
<p>"Tsk! Tsk! <i>Nein.</i> Besser you come live wid me."</p>
<p>"That's no joke." Joe was solemn.</p>
<p>Myrtie had a new lavender crepe outfit for the occasion, and
she loved people telling her it was unbelievable that she was the
mother of that strapping big foot-ball player.</p>
<p>Amalia could plainly see that Neal was the finest looking boy
in the class of thirty-four young people. And at that, even
discounting for prejudice, Amalia was not far wrong, for Neal was
big and well-knit and the happy-go-lucky glint in his eyes added
something to his charm.</p>
<p>In truth it helped get him into the Pi Beta Chi fraternity at
the University that fall, along with the excellent facts that he
was a foot-ball player, had a high-powered roadster of his own
and a dad well enough off to be retired. That no one inquired
into his scholastic standing is not too astounding.</p>
<p>A fraternity bid being, as it is in most midwestern colleges,
a ticket to Paradise, a fraternity pin, the receipt of the
ticket's purchase, there was no question in Neal's mind but that
he would "go frat."</p>
<p>Several of the fraternities looked upon Neal Holms of
Westville with covetous eyes, so that there was rather a
concerted and noisy fight over him on rush week. And rush week
being largely a survival of the fightest, it was hard at one time
to tell which of the steam-rolling methods would capture him.</p>
<p>Those methods were varied and telling. Although he did not see
it himself, he was told of the fellow taken up in a plane by
three Phi Psis, hearing that he was to be wearing a Phi Psi pin
en route down or he wouldn't get down, deciding during the third
loop to pin it on,--of the fellow who thought his dinner
invitation was a bid and arrived with his baggage,--of the
mortgage-holding uncle who threatened to foreclose on the house
if his nephew didn't qualify.</p>
<p>As for himself and the methods employed to get him--there was
the way the Alpha Sigs flashed the magic of Sam Towle in his
eyes,--(gosh, <i>the</i> Sam Towle who was the All-American
half-back). There was the way the Betas dazzled him with the
luxury of their palatial house which they spoke of casually as
"the dump." There were the Delts trailing across his vision, like
a red flag of distress, the plea that he alone could bring back
to them the pristine glory that had been theirs when the great
Pat Smithson had bled and died for them on the gridiron. (Imagine
<i>that,</i>--thinking <i>he</i> could take Pat Smithson's
place.) With fine disregard of laws concerning "sweat shops," the
Sig Alphs tried to wear him down in the shower room. The Pi Beta
Chis trotted out a Phi Beta Kappa alum as nonchalantly as though
he were not the only one of the species that had ever been
coralled behind its wrought-iron doors, and who, they said, would
be tickled to death to help Neal in any way he could.</p>
<p>"Might be handy to be in a frat with a few walking
encyclopedias dashing in every night or so--what, old boy?"</p>
<p>He attended smokers and dinners at the Cornhusker, was taken
for shows and for walks and rides, was called "Pal" and "Buddy"
and "Old Chap" and "Kingfish," was slapped on the back,
shoulders, knees and in the pit of his stomach, was told he could
room with the president of each frat, with every fraternity
member of the football team that had licked Pittsburgh, and with
every hit in the masculine dramatic Kosmet Klub. He was promised
the absolute run of the Theta, Kappa, Delta Gamma and Pi Phi
houses, dates with the Junior Prom girl, the Mortar Board
president and Nebraska U's Sweetheart.</p>
<p>Small wonder that Neal Holms in tailored suit and high-powered
roadster and collegiate spotlight seemed far removed from Herman
Holmsdorfer in blue jeans cracking his blacksnake over the backs
of oxen on the lonely prairie.</p>
<p>All this time each fraternity house was a womanless
Eden,--your college men fight this thing out alone without
feminine interference to complicate matters.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, Neal found himself at the end of the battle
with five pledge buttons, which under existing conditions were
several too many, so that he was compelled to think up four
air-tight excuses.</p>
<p>He went Pi Beta Chi,--and sometimes after that the fellows in
other fraternities who had nearly wept on his shoulder and tapped
him lovingly in the stomach, took time out to speak to him on the
campus, but more often they did not.</p>
<p>And life became a geographical thing bounded by a few city
blocks and a campus,--a mental affair of no small effort,--a
physical one of hard freshman foot-ball practice,--and an
emotional one of rather formidable dimensions caused by the sight
of more pulchritude running around at large than he had been
accustomed to see.</p>

<h2><a name="c34" id="c34">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the last ten years Cedar City had grown accustomed to
seeing old Matthias Meier walk up and down the streets of their
elm-shaded town, swinging his cane pompously. From his son's home
down Washington Street to the corner of Main, turning down Main
to the bank, speaking to every one along the way: "Good morning,
Miss Smith," "How are you, Boze?", nodding to those whose names
he could not recall or did not know.</p>
<p>At the bank he would walk through the lobby into Carter's
office. There they would discuss for a time the problems of the
day,--to buy the Waterville bonds or not,--whether John Seliger's
note could be renewed,--could Tessie Porter, the dressmaker, have
a hundred-dollar loan on nothing much but an honest character.
Back home toward noon, there to rest and read until about three
when he would go down again for the last hour "to see how the day
had gone."</p>
<p>Sometimes he went to Lincoln, grown to eighty thousand from
the four log-cabins, visiting with old friends here and there for
a few moments, always taking one stroll past the Pi Beta Chi
house to see how it looked now,--"just as good as
ever,--<i>there</i> was a house for you, built for the
years,"--and always to the new capitol which rose like something
of his own he had dreamed.</p>
<p>Uncompleted, but giving promise of perfection, it satisfied
his very soul. American, that's what it was,--the broad sweeping
base was the fertile prairie,--the tower to rise from this great
white spread of stone was to symbolize all the aspirations and
dreams and ideals the old builders of the state had held in their
hearts but could not express.</p>
<p>No one knew it, but he would rather have been on the capitol
commission than anything he could choose. Too old, of course.
Lots of grief connected with it. Younger men must serve on that.
But he liked to talk with those who had its building on their
hearts,--men who were giving it all the loyalty they bore the
state. Stop in and see them when he could catch them,--talk over
the old days with the State Historian who knew every phase of its
beginning and growth.</p>
<p>Once he and Charlie Briggs went up to the capitol together.
Matthias, tall and well-tailored, snow-white hair and
beard,--Charlie Briggs, little and gnarled, shaggy-whiskered, his
navy blue suit hanging sack-like on his thin body,--both in their
eighties. Together they walked through the main corridor and
rotunda, looking at the tiles and the mosaics. More than one
person turned to glance at the two old men, so different in
appearance, apparently so engrossed in their own
conversation.</p>
<p>"Seems a thousand years ago you advised me to come over here
and locate in the prairie grass, Charlie."</p>
<p>"More like yistiddy to me, Matt."</p>
<p>"It's a great old state. Founded by substantial folks. Given
the world something, too, besides grain and hogs. Given it
artists and writers, singers and actors, big men in educational
and business lines, dean of the Harvard law school, a general of
all the armies. Something of the strength of the prairie may have
been built into her children."</p>
<p>"She was kind of a harsh old mother, Matt,--the prairie,--but
sufferin' snakes, I liked her."</p>
<p>There was a long pause, and then:</p>
<p>"I want to live to see it completed, Charlie."</p>
<p>"Me, too, Matt."</p>
<p>But now the trips to Lincoln were all over. Over, too, were
the trips down Washington to Main,--down Main to the bank.</p>
<p>Old Matthias was nearly done for. Every day this spring when
it was sunshiny enough he sat in the yard for a few
hours,--waiting. They didn't need to try to cover it. He knew.
Ever since that sudden sick spell. Lucile and Carter in cheerful
voices called this convalescing. All right, call it anything they
wanted.</p>
<p>Sitting here to-day in the sunshine old Matthias' mind was
delving into the past. Until lately he had never been guilty of
doing much of that. "Too busy with the crowded hour to fear to
live or die,"--Emerson he thought that was. No, he had not
succumbed to the habit of retrospection to any great extent as
did many men of his age. It was a vicious habit, belonging only
to those old people whose mentality could not keep pace with the
times.</p>
<p>He had always disliked those who did it too much, making bores
of themselves with their ancient reminiscences. Charlie Briggs
lived almost entirely in the past with his "'Long about 1872," or
"I recol'ect the winter of '89." But for some reason he had been
doing some of it himself lately--going over old memories,
suddenly finding how easy it was to recall happenings of years
before.</p>
<p>This afternoon with the sun making flickering leaf shadows on
the new grass at his feet, he tried to understand this tendency
to return to the scenes of youth. Did one go halfway through
life, as though to a hilltop, and then start this looking back?
No, there was no definite time in which it happened. One seemed
always to be looking hopefully and enthusiastically forward,--and
then without realizing it, found one's self in these moods of
looking back.</p>
<p>On a trip to California, he and Ida, in the Hancock Park
section of Los Angeles, had once seen the old La Brea pits where
the tar of a score of thousand years bubbles up to the surface of
the ground. There had been found the skeleton remains of
prehistoric animals,--the saber-tooth tiger and the lion and the
sloth,--a bone at a time, the animal skeletons had been found and
fitted together for museums.</p>
<p>This afternoon he dug in the past of his life as the workers
had dug for bones in the La Brea pits. He took out single scenes,
fitting them together with others as the bones were fitted,--a
bit of this and a bit of that,--seeing now from his hilltop how
events might have been. Some things could have been
bettered,--some should have stayed the same. No matter, for good
or ill, they had been fitted together, and it was too late now to
figure out how productive of good any change would have been.
Queer, how things he used to think important, seemed less so now.
Little things of minute value at the time, now loomed large in
retrospection. Wherein should life have been different? How much
of it was Fate? How much his own decision?</p>
<p>Suddenly, with almost no warning thought, he remembered his
first sweetheart. She stepped into view out of the past as clear
as a picture. He had not thought of her for years, but she came
now, white and pink and blue-eyed and lovely. She had been
Romance. Ida had never been Romance. She had been steady undying
Love. She had been wife, comrade, friend,--but never Romance.
That belonged with Amalia. And though desire had long died within
him, yet for a moment his blood stirred to the memory of the
touch of the pink lips of Amalia and the supple warm body of
her.</p>
<p>Yes, some of the things in life we decide for ourselves. In
others it is Providence, Luck, or the Spinning Fates. He thought
of his youthful hot-headed race to Nebraska City, smiled at the
thought of those days on the sandbar,--of the way such a
situation could be handled now. Cars, motor-boats, planes. What
the outcome would have been if he had arrived in time, of course
he could not know. But to have seen her and to have talked with
her, she would no doubt have gone with him. Her father could
scarcely have held her against her will.</p>
<p>How different girls were these days. One couldn't imagine a
modern girl displaying the weakness with which Amalia must have
succumbed to her father's authority and gone obediently with him.
She would have been as ready to go with her lover if he could
have appeared in time to influence her. But by the hair's breadth
of a few hours the thing had been decided. When he arrived, the
marriage had been consummated. Now they wouldn't even stop at the
marriage vow but would hurdle that too. In those days it
constituted a formidable barrier. Well, it was a good thing,
perhaps, that some of these decisions did fall into the hands of
Providence or Lady Luck or the Spinning Fates. Once he would have
chosen Amalia. Probably Ida had made him a better wife,--but even
without that in her favor, he could not imagine any one else in
her place for the half-century.</p>
<p>Hazel was coming down the terrace toward him with her long
athletic stride and her air of freedom from all restraints. She
was nearly ready for the University, some of the rough edges
toned down, her brace off for several years, the freckles
miraculously disappearing into her creamy complexion.</p>
<p>Could one imagine two more opposite young women than Hazel and
this little Amalia of whom he had just been thinking? He smiled
at the thought, and when she had thrown herself in a chair
opposite him, he said suddenly: "Hazel, did you ever stop to
think how a person imagines he is carrying out his own decision,
doing the thing he planned? But is he? How much is predestined?
Except for our higher order of minds we are like the little moles
under the earth carrying out blindly the work of digging,
thinking our own dark passage-ways constitute all there is to the
world. . . ."</p>
<p>Hazel was frankly bored. Restless, energetic, it seemed rather
a waste of time to sit here and listen to grandfather's vague
generalities. They sounded too much like his pal, the old Indian
scout. No longer was old Charlie Briggs a hero to Miss Meier. She
twisted about a bit in her chair, as though seeking a more
comfortable position, giving him credit in her mind, though, for
one thing,--he seldom emitted a lot of junk like this.</p>
<p>"A half-dozen people . . ." he went on, "out of all the
hundreds we've contacted stand out in the end as really and
recognizably influencing our lives. A few whom we have loved or
hated or emulated. Why, I've even been thinking of my first
sweetheart," he laughed deprecatingly.</p>
<p>Hazel sat up alertly. Here was no generality, nothing
boresome. Here was interest, concrete and definite. No longer was
she the little girl who had said she would have none of
Romance.</p>
<p>"Oh, I say, Grandad, that <i>is</i> something. You mean a girl
. . . <i>not</i> Grandmother?"</p>
<p>"Not your grandmother."</p>
<p>"Why, you old flirt . . . tell me about it. She didn't
die?"</p>
<p>"No, . . . much worse." He smiled across at her. "She married
some one else."</p>
<p>"Yes . . . yes . . . go on. Am <i>I</i> all <i>ears?</i> Tell
me. Tell me everything."</p>
<p>"There's not much to tell. I suppose spring had something to
do with it . . . spring and youth and propinquity. I was working
in a foundry in Illinois. She came stepping out of the sunlight
one day into the dark foundry like a little blue and white and
pink figure stepping out of a miniature,--or a little Dresden
china figure."</p>
<p>"Not <i>really,</i> Grandpa! Why, you old poet."</p>
<p>"You're the only person in the world I've ever told this to.
She moved out here from Illinois . . . and married. I came out
here, too, to what was then called the new west . . . following
her in a blind sort of way, a young blade thinking I could pick
her up and carry her off, even though good sense told me how
foolish it was. But . . . you follow your wild enthusiastic
fancies when you're young."</p>
<p>"And you never saw her again?"</p>
<p>"I never saw her."</p>
<p>"Nor heard of her?"</p>
<p>"Nor heard of her specifically . . . but once. I knew in a
general way . . . the farming section . . . where her group of
people located, but I never saw her again."</p>
<p>"Grandpa . . . tell me this." Hazel leaned forward with wide,
dark eyes. "Did you <i>ever</i> get over it?"</p>
<p>He laughed aloud. "Oh, yes . . . yes, indeed. The long journey
on the boat, the docking at strange towns, the excitement of
arriving in the new country, all had their place in the scheme of
things. I was young and ambitious. I rather think I was beginning
to recover very soon. After awhile there were other young people
too . . . your grandmother. Life was very full. And yet. . .
."</p>
<p>"Yet what, Grandfather?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I think one never entirely forgets an emotional
experience like that. But after awhile the thing was only half
remembered . . . and then almost forgotten . . . then entirely .
. . until now."</p>
<p>"Why <i>now,</i> Grandpa?"</p>
<p>"You'd laugh."</p>
<p>"No, I won't, Grandpa . . . honestly, I won't laugh."</p>
<p>"I heard a meadow-lark sing."</p>
<p>"It reminded you of her?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh, how <i>romantic."</i></p>
<p>"And perhaps because I've had time recently to sit and think .
. . and remember times of emotion. In business you have no
emotion,--you have only a hard-boiled mental life."</p>
<p>"I think it's a lot sadder that you got over it, Grandpa, than
if you hadn't."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it was."</p>
<p>"What was her name?"</p>
<p>"I haven't said it aloud for nearly sixty years. It was . . .
Amalia." His voice lingered over it, drawing it out liquidly.</p>
<p>"Amalia. It's kind of musical, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"That's what I used to think."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Old Matthias Meier did not live to see the capitol finished.
He died in a few months as he had felt he would. Toward the last
he knew it was not going to be so hard to leave as he had always
thought. Sometimes during that last month, in his exhaustion and
weakness, when the nights were troubled and unnatural and the
days no better, he looked forward longingly to that place in
Lincoln called <i>Wyuka,</i> which is Indian for "a place to lie
down and sleep."</p>
<p>Charlie Briggs came as soon as he heard, trudging up the
sidewalk to Carter Meier's house, his blue suit hanging baggily
on his thin little frame. "Matt knowed I wouldn't fail him."</p>
<p>When it was over,--Matthias' things put away out of sight, and
much of the necessary business attended to, Carter Meier settled
down to life without his father.</p>
<p>On a rainy evening when Lucile and Hazel were both there, he
brought out and opened his father's small, old-fashioned
trunk,--a queer little calf-skin chest bound in brass. He had
never seen one just like it anywhere else, with its few red hairs
worn by the original animal owner still plainly visible along the
sides.</p>
<p>"I wonder if the Historical Society wouldn't like it?" he said
to Lucile and to Hazel sitting near.</p>
<p>Lucile had a book and merely said pleasantly but vaguely:
"Maybe it would."</p>
<p>Hazel, intent on the opening of the trunk, made no comment for
a moment. When she did it was to say: "Do you know, there's
something sort of heathenish and unkind about it, Dad. After a
death, delving into a dead person's things that way when they
can't help it. Don't you feel as though you were
trespassing?"</p>
<p>"Oh . . . I might with some people's things. But not Father's.
I've had charge of his affairs so much this last year and his
life was such an open book."</p>
<p>For a half-hour or more Carter Meier took out and examined the
neatly folded papers and account books, a set of income and
expense books,--all of ancient vintage and worthless. Anything
important was in the lock-box at the bank. There were two or
three pictures of his mother,--one in a tight silk dress with
panels and enough buttons up and down its length and breadth to
start a retail button shop.</p>
<p>There were pictures of himself, too, as a scared-looking baby
in a dress cascading to the floor, and as a little boy. At one he
laughed long and loudly and called his family's attention to it.
In a velvet suit and lace collar he stood heavily on one foot
with the other leg neatly crossed over it, in his hand the end of
a long ivy vine wandering down from a flower-pot above him.</p>
<p>"To this day I remember how I was pinching that vine, taking
out of my murderous heart all the venom I felt for the
photographer and putting it into the death of that innocent
plant."</p>
<p>And after his laughter came something more serious,--it seemed
such a very short time ago he was that little Fauntleroy-looking
boy with an Apache heart,--and now he was fifty-six.</p>
<p>Everything was out now but a dingy, brown wallet. He had not
seen it for nearly a half-century, but he could remember his
father carrying it in that long gone time. There proved to be
nothing in the old thing but a yellowed piece of paper which fell
at his touch into six slim oblong sections. It was written in
German and almost illegible at that.</p>
<p>"Hazel, how much German do you know?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I can <i>habe</i> and <i>heil</i> a little. Let me have a
try."</p>
<p>She went to the library table and laid the six parts carefully
together, bending her fresh loveliness over the musty broken
pieces of the yellowed paper.</p>
<p>". . . <i>'ist es besser.'</i> That's duck's soup for a
starter," she said aloud. <i>"It is better."</i></p>
<p>Her father and mother were both listening, more impressed by
their gay young daughter's smartness than with anything the old
letter might say.</p>
<p>"<i>'Zu gedenken' . . .</i> let's see . . . <i>'zu
gedenken,'"</i> her voice slipped into a low murmur as she tried
to think of it. "I know . . . <i>to remember.</i> How'm I doin',
folks?"</p>
<p>They nodded approval. These modern girls!</p>
<p>"<i>'im Frühyahr' . . .</i> that's 'in springtime.' Now . . .
all together . . . pull! '<i>It is better to remember in
springtime.'"</i></p>
<p>Suddenly she saw for the first time the word <i>Amalia.</i>
Something came into her mind,--stole in subtly,--something
bringing a faint far-off breath of a long-gone year and the lilt
of a meadow-lark singing. This was a note from Grandpa's first
sweetheart.</p>
<p>"You're the only person I've ever told . . ." he had said.</p>
<p>She read the remainder of the legible sentence to herself. It
was Grandpa's secret and because he was not here to guard the
little message as he had evidently done all the years, she would
do it for him,--would not drag it out into the open even for Dad
and Mother.</p>
<p><i>Unsre Liebe,</i>--our love. Something about the forlorn
little note touched her unaccountably. A swift mist came to her
eyes and she had to clear her throat to say lightly, "Oh, that's
all I can get out of it, folks."</p>
<p>All the rest of the evening it filled her with a vague
sadness. She was glad he had married Grandmother, couldn't bear
to think of it otherwise. But there was something pathetic about
that one legible sentence,--the way life moved on and changed and
love went with it, too.</p>
<p><i>. . . it is better to remember our love as it was in the
springtime.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c35" id="c35">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the fall of 1930 Hazel Meier went up to the University too.
Lucile had taken her to Omaha to outfit her,--she had purchased
sports clothes and silk pajamas, dinner gowns, dresses for
afternoon wear, and accessories for everything. Lucile had no
trouble in pleasing Hazel with the sports clothes,--it took some
effort to get her into long, slinky gowns in which she declared
to all and sundry salesladies that she felt like kicking
something with every step. But Lucile was firm. Hazel was a young
lady now,--no more of this living in tennis outfits all day long.
Everything ran to browns and tans and oranges for her,--cream or
white or eggshell for evening with that hair and complexion.</p>
<p>When Carter saw the bills he whistled long and loudly. Bonds
these days were anæmic,--he was worried. There were more griefs
in the banking business now than in all his other years put
together. He missed his father every day.</p>
<p>There was no exciting fight over Hazel by the sororities.
Lucile had been a Theta. The Delta Gams gave her a half-hearted
rush, knowing she had too much Theta blood in her to inoculate
with any other virus. The Kappas told her Theta was so badly run
down since her mother's time that of course she would put aside
that old mother-daughter sentiment, to which she might have given
ear if she had not heard a Theta hand out the same line to a
Kappa daughter with a mere reversal of Greek letters.</p>
<p>After the usual three days of breakfasts, luncheons, teas, and
dinners, with time out to look up her courses, she went Theta. No
one was surprised,--it was in the cards. Followed
registration,--consternation,--concentration,--amalgamation,--sophistication,--the
metamorphosis of a Greek letter girl can be traced as readily as
the growth of a tree, by rings of different fibers.</p>
<p>At first she was timid, afraid of the upper classmen, prone to
say "Yes, indeed" to any comment from them, deferred to the house
mother as to an oracle.</p>
<p>Gradually she began dating. She whose masculine attentions in
Cedar City had consisted heretofore largely of neighbor boys
draping themselves at intervals over the front steps and calling
to her to get a move on, now learned what collegiate dates were,
both of the open-eyed and blind varieties.</p>
<p>By her sophomore year, what with her good clothes and her
reputation of being a snappy little number, she was credited at
the House with one-hundred per cent dating ability. In her junior
year she was sophisticated, svelte, unruffled under any
situation, told the house mother in velvet-concealed words where
to get off, removed the velvet shield on occasion when some good
sister crossed her path in social territory.</p>
<p>It was getting toward spring of that year when she went into
the old library, took a casual survey of empty chairs and with
apparent superb indifference to her surroundings carefully chose
one across from a junior law,--an awfully good-looking Pi Chi by
the name of Neal Holms. She gave him a slanting glance several
times, but evidently he was occupied with some ponderous volume.
All right,--he didn't have to deign to look her way,--suit
himself. In a few moments he was pushing a card toward her. It
contained his name engraved thereon, with a penciled caption
under it,--so that it now read:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Neal Holms<br>
Pass the tomes.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>She frowned,--shoved the two voluminous books near her his
way, scribbled underneath:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Hazel Meier<br>
Don't rouse my ire.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Unsmiling, he found his reference, then turned the card over,
wrote on it, pushed it back. It questioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Why don't I dare?</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And was sent back with the laconic answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Red hair.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A little later he handed it back. It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Date you?</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Hazel wrote promptly:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Hate to.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This time he drew a picture,--two toothpick-looking creatures
hand in hand, and wrote underneath:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Aw, give in.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Hazel scribbled:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>You win.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Neal Holms dated Hazel Meier for a fraternity formal.</p>
<p>From the first he liked her,--liked her tip-tilted nose on
which, if the light were right, you could see a freckle or
two,--liked her independence and her creamy complexion,--her
hazel eyes and her snappy come-backs,--the cocky way she wore a
beret on the side of her head.</p>
<p>Two more care-free young people financially and otherwise in
the University it would have been hard to find.</p>
<p>He dated her again for another formal, other times for no
reason but "a date,"--then for the Junior-Senior prom which ended
the winter social season. And for that matter it almost ended
everything else for them, too. There was an inauguration of a new
president in Washington,--followed by a peculiar phenomenon in
banking circles called a moratorium. Carter Meier's bank
closed.</p>
<p>Even before this the echoes from the eastern coast financial
marts had reverberated to the outskirts of the last little
village, to every farm home in every state. But for a time in the
small places of the midwestern states, they had been only voices
heard afar off. Contrary to geometric equations, the shortest
distance between the two given points of Wall Street and Carter
Meier's bank was by no means a straight line. It took a multitude
of directions, and arrived through various channels,--South
American bonds being one of its routes of travel.</p>
<p>Carter Meier had seen the value of his various bonds slipping
under par,--skidding, sliding with sickening pace. It was a
condition shared in fraternal worry by his colleagues.</p>
<p>All were frightened, bewildered. Not one could share the
anxiety with another for fear of giving away his own secret
worry.</p>
<p>No, the ocean of catastrophe known as the Wall Street debacle
did not sweep at once with full tide into some of the sections of
the country. Where its waves crashed with devastating force in
many places, in others the back-wash rippled in later. Cedar City
seemed secure. It was bounded by agriculture,--its soil rich, its
banks secure, its farmers honest. Even though prices were far too
low, crops were almost always good these years. A poor wheat year
usually found a good corn crop,--when the corn failed, the wheat
crop had recompensed for the failure.</p>
<p>But now the back-wash came in,--bonds that had been purchased
for one hundred went to eighty, sixty, forty,--defaulted. Two of
Carter Meier's corresponding banks stayed closed. Farmers could
not pay because they had nothing with which to pay. More, a
strange and unbelievable attitude seized a portion of the
population, a slipping of morale. "Try and get it" became the
manner of some. Carter Meier in noting this insidious change
thought often of his father, of old Charlie Briggs, of those
others of the old school whose word had been all the legality one
needed.</p>
<p>He worked, planned, collected, figured, fought. Sometimes he
grew bitter with the injustice of it. Others no smarter or better
than he were getting through. The difference of a bond purchase
or two,--of a few less notes that had to be charged off,--and
they were weathering the storm.</p>
<p>Time,--if he only could have time for things to stage a
come-back, he would be all right. Time! That was what a man who
was to be hung wanted. He had days of feeling he had
won,--followed by days of realizing he had lost,--high moments of
hope,--black ones of despair. The depression won. The bank stayed
closed. You could not do with life as you wished.</p>
<p>He paid twice the amount of his stock. It took the last of
what his father had left him. The estate, too, had shrunk when
Depression, that rough laundryman, had finished with it. Some of
the investments had been left as a trust fund for Hazel,--that,
of course, could not and should not be touched.</p>
<p>He sold the house for what he could get,--moved to a Lincoln
apartment when a receiver job was given him. Lucile was sobered,
hurt, still incredulous over what had happened, but game. "For
better or for worse" spoken that day in the Lincoln church before
an elaborate wedding party of eight bridesmaids attending her,
with all the leading families looking on, had meant something to
Lucile. The situation was a reversal of her own parents'
experiences and that of Father and Mother Meier. The "worse," so
far as hard work and getting established, had been their earlier
portion, their easy life at the last. Her own was the other way
around,--harder, too,--for she and Carter had none of the buoyant
hope they had possessed a quarter of a century before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Farther out in the state Joe Holms wondered every hour of the
day and during sleepless nights how any one could get so heavily
involved when much of the land had been given him.</p>
<p>Over and over in his mind he pondered the turn of his
fortunes. He knew there were great economic forces at work over
which he had no control. If things had been as Myrtie always
said,--if the land had stayed worth the price they had so
blithely put upon it,--if they had not bought so lavishly, had
not gone so deeply into debt, had stayed on the first good old
half-section without purchasing any more acres,--above all, had
<i>worked</i> it themselves, earning their living there, content
with what it would bring, as his father and grandfather had
worked before him for their daily bread, this great indebtedness
would not be looming always before him like some fearsome
giant.</p>
<p>He went back often in his mind to the first of Myrtie's
pleadings to change things. Pasting a cheap stucco over the good
old stones of the house had been almost prophetic in its covering
up the real issues of life, the things that were vital. Work? Why
should he have lessened his activities because there had seemed
enough to live on? Work was good. Work was every man's portion in
life. He had grown soft,--under fifty yet, and he was flabby. Old
Charlie Briggs in his eighties who came visiting through the
neighborhood sometimes, wouldn't ride anywhere, wouldn't accept a
lift on the highway for fear he'd grow soft.</p>
<p>Yes, that which he had labeled a kindness to Myrtie and which
Myrtie had labeled a kindness to Neal had been no kindness at
all. But he wouldn't hide behind Myrtie's skirts. He was the head
of the house, or should have been. Now he could see he had been
no better than the loafers sitting on the sidewalks spitting
their contempt at a world which they thought owed them a
living.</p>
<p>Other farmers were getting through. All had been under the
same general outside forces,--all under the same weather
conditions. But not all had been caught as he was. Young Carl
Schaffer was working out,--the Lawrences. But they had used
better sense. They had lived on their own butter and eggs,
chickens, and small produce. When they sold a crop, it had gone
to pay off their principal. He and Myrtie, with their hands in
the sack as though there were no end to the income,--they had
been caught.</p>
<p>He sat now on the stone-house steps at the farm looking out at
the old soap-kettle there in the yard with the dead stems of
ancient flowers left in it. There was something symbolic about
it, he suddenly decided. His grandmother had made soap in it
every spring and fall,--enough to last for a half-year. His
mother with her lessening activities had dispensed with it,
letting the men take it for hog-feed and chicken-mash. His wife
had planted flowers in it,--typical of the way they had grown to
look at life,--flowers, no work, but plenty of income. Flowers
over all the harsh facts of life. Flowers in the
soap-kettle,--and a complacent feeling that the soap would arrive
some way.</p>
<p>Well, the flowers in the soap-kettle were dead and rotted now.
So were all the fancy notions of life.</p>
<p>He called Neal home from school that week-end for an
interview.</p>
<p>He was a long time getting at what he wanted to say, so long
that Neal with his more direct way of looking at life said:
"What's the racket, Dad? Let's have it out."</p>
<p>"I mean . . . the way things are . . . the town house here is
going back to the owner,--the eighty I bought, too,--the eighty
my father bought goes to the bank for notes . . . I have to pay
my double indemnity on the Meredith bank. . . ."</p>
<p>"You mean we're sunk?"</p>
<p>"Something like that. Grandma's two hundred and forty is left
unencumbered out of the wreckage."</p>
<p>"Here's where I stop school."</p>
<p>"No. Let's figure it out together. I've just one son and he
has just one year more. We'll make it some way. You'd disappoint
me now not to go that much longer. But for God's sake, don't
spend any more than you have to."</p>
<p>"I promise you that."</p>
<p>"And don't tell Mother just yet. It would worry her."</p>
<p>"If you ask me, Dad, there's been an awful lot of that
not-telling-mother stuff. I'm going out and tell her."</p>
<p>Joe followed Neal anxiously, protesting, out to the sun-room
where Myrtie sat with a book, to hear him tell his mother the
bold and bald facts.</p>
<p>Myrtie put her hand over her heart. "Oh . . . oh! I can stand
anything but that."</p>
<p>Joe tried to stroke her hair, but she pushed his hand
away.</p>
<p>"We'll go back to the stone house, Myrtie. We'll fix it up
nice. I'll go into the field again. We'll get some comfort out of
life now, not owing any one."</p>
<p>"Oh, Joe . . . how could you . . . how <i>could</i> you?"</p>
<p>"He's not done anything disgraceful, Mom. He's just caught
like a thousand others. He'll go back and work out, and I'll
help."</p>
<p>"Oh . . . oh . . . just the same old thing . . . just corn and
dirt and pigs and chickens." She was gasping, her hand at her
throat.</p>
<p>Joe would have called a doctor, but Neal was unmoved. "That's
just high-steericks, Mom." He laughed at her. "Tears and wailings
and beating your head against the old wall aren't going to do any
good." He touseled her hair as though she were a youngster.
"You're going to move back to the farm <i>and like it.</i> And
thank your lucky stars you've got one to go to."</p>
<p>Joe stood looking at him in astonishment, deep respect, and
with no small degree of envy.</p>
<p>Joe and Myrtie went back to the big stone house where Myrtie
said she just gave up, there was so little to live for.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c36" id="c36">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Moisture was below normal all summer even where the lands like
Joe's were rich and loamy. But farther west where the season was
one of drouth, the powdered top soil was lifted into the air with
every high prairie wind. It was as though Mother Nature in
disturbed mood was beginning to clean her house, to set to right
her disarranged plans. With a giant broom she whisked the dirt
from those rooms in which she had intended only grazing lands to
be.</p>
<p>But unheeding, the wheat farmers scratched again the
pulverized soil and dropped their seed in the looseness of its
powder.</p>
<p>Neal and Hazel both went back to school. Life had taken on a
more serious aspect, but Youth is hard to keep down. Unless it is
cold, hungry, ill, and discouraged, it can find an outlet in its
own bubbling vitality,--and they were none of these. To be sure,
Hazel, who had walked into the shops and chosen her apparel with
little thought to expense, now planned every move with an eye to
economy.</p>
<p>"Take a look-see at the dress," she said to Neal who had come
for her on a date. "That which used to be the front is now the
back, the inside is the outside, the top side is now the bottom
side,--proving that all which goes up must come down."</p>
<p>"Huh--that's nothing. I've got a big-time job,--currying Doc
Sanders' car. I went over to Prof. Morrison's to see if I could
get his yard to mow,--would have gotten it, too, but Bud Merrill,
the squirt, took the lawn-mower right out of my mouth, so to
speak."</p>
<p>Neal drove home often. "Seems as though my dad has sort of
lost his nerve or something. Goes over and over the same old
hashing of what he did or didn't do. It isn't that he doesn't
work. It isn't physical. He acts bewildered all the time about
what's best to do,--all this corn-hog stuff,--anything with a
decision to make. And I'll be darned if I know whether he'll ever
make any money again or not--what with plowing under the piglets
and not letting the big cornstalks have any little cornstalks. He
knows a lot more about the whole thing than I do but is always
cornering me and asking my opinion. Makes me feel chesty."</p>
<p>"My poor Dad, too. Says he never wants to be responsible for
anything again, content to work for some one else the rest of his
life. Queer, isn't it, what a year can bring you?"</p>
<p>And it <i>was</i> queer what a year could bring you, for when
school ended Neal and Hazel were engaged.</p>
<p>What matter when it was or where it was, or the words that
were said. Youth is Youth and the words remain similar. As a
matter of fact, perhaps it was at no special time or place.
Perhaps too often Neal had said in the jaunty modern unromantic
way: "I like your aristo-snooty-looking nose" or "You're some
little trick, Red Head," or sung boldly at her in an atrociously
frog-like voice: "Stay As Sweet As You Are," to make any proposal
necessary.</p>
<p>Suffice to say Neal sent the candy to the Theta house, and
broke the news to his Pi Beta Chis in the old Meier house where
the neckties hung untidily through the grill-work of which Ida
had once been so proud, and their owners tried with tragic
success to imitate Fred Astaire's dancing on the inlaid mosaic of
the great entrance hall.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Carter Meier announced the engagement of their
daughter Hazel to Neal Holms by way of the Sunday papers. Ivy Day
arrived. Examinations. Commencement,--in the setting of countless
huge buildings with many thousand students swarming over the
campus where once the cows snatched at the prairie grass. Hazel
had her diploma from the Teachers College of the U,--Neal his law
degree, and if "superior scholarship" and "cum laude" were
strangely missing from these, the two young people were in the
good company of many others of average intelligence.</p>
<p>Hazel was to teach one year at Irving, a small town in the
Republican Valley,--Neal was to stay at home with his father for
the same length of time, lending his young strength and his
unflagging spirits to Joe's discouragement before hanging out his
law shingle.</p>
<p>It was a bad summer. Drouth came on like a malignant sore on
the breast of nature. Hot belching winds blew in from the
southwest. Thin clouds, dry as feathers, slipped across the blue.
The grass in the pastures burned as with a prairie-fire. Weeds,
devoid of sap, rattled in the hot winds. Leaves, too lifeless to
cling, dropped from the dry elms.</p>
<p>"Like in de old days," Amalia said often and shook her head
dubiously. Tsk! Tsk!</p>
<p>There was a great deal of talk about legislation and
regimentation. Joe snorted: "Legislate the hot winds and
regimentate the clouds and we farmers'll get along all right by
ourselves."</p>
<p>Neal took Hazel to Irving in September, stayed to cast his eye
over her school and her boarding-house, got back to the farm in
time to see the rain come. Leaves on the elms dripped clammily.
Puddles stood on the graveled highways. Water ran off a hillside
that was baked too hard to hold it. And it was not raining
anything so sentimental or ornamental as daffodils. It was
raining wheat for bread. It was raining forage crops,--sudan
grass and rye and sweet clover. It was raining pasturage and wild
hay and alfalfa,--next year's apple-buds and cherry-buds and
vegetables in gardens. It was raining hope and courage and a
renewed morale.</p>
<p>"Stars fell on Alabama," he said jubilantly when he went into
the house, "and that's all right with me, but showers fell on
Nebraska and that's much more to the point."</p>
<p>Joe worried a good deal now about Grandma down there alone at
her little house, but old Amalia was cheerful. "I am goot company
for myself," she said. "I vork ven I vish; I sleep ven I vish; I
sew my qvilts ven I vish; I do not'ing ven I vish."</p>
<p>Joe and Neal were both good to her,--Myrtie not unkind, merely
wrapped in her own troubles.</p>
<p>Toward spring she seemed much more feeble. So little did she
walk out now that Neal decided to put in a radio for her. For a
while she stood out against it. "For vat should I vant to have de
singin' here at all times of de night, Neal?"</p>
<p>When he assured her that no quartette or jazz orchestra had
any intention of presuming on her hospitality at times when they
were not welcome, she let him put in one.</p>
<p>Her first manipulation of it was under his instruction.</p>
<p>"You snap this first. Then turn this until you find what you
want, and then this one to get the sound just as you want it. Now
try."</p>
<p>Old Amalia snapped the brass knob. Then she turned
<i>this.</i> Columbus sailing westward, a Wright brother going up
in the air,--and old Amalia turning the knob on a radio!</p>
<p>". . . headin' for the last round-up" it blared forth like
semi-musical thunder.</p>
<p>"Now tune it down softer."</p>
<p>"Loud I like it," said old Amalia. And loud she kept it.</p>
<p>To the family's surprise it proved to be news that she liked
the best. Old Amalia who had lived most of her long years on her
Nebraska farm liked best the happenings from far places. She knew
when every news period came on, settled herself with her latest
quilt, rather appropriately doing the Around-the-World pattern,
and listened to the latest happenings in places she had never
been, and of whose existence she scarcely knew. Through the waves
of the air, across the brown prairie, every day now the mountain
came to Mahomet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c37" id="c37">CHAPTER XXXVII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Spring came to the midwest in a cloud of dust. To Carter and
Lucile in their modest apartment in Lincoln it was a hazy,
disagreeable one, the sunlight sifting through the yellow,
dust-laden air from the black blizzard farther to the west.</p>
<p>They had never grown used to Hazel being away,--often in the
evening they found themselves sitting idly, listening for the
footsteps of a gay young crowd which no longer came. Once in one
of these idle moods Lucile caught Carter's eye. "That way lies
madness," she laughed, but not quite whole-heartedly. "Let's
throw a wild party and go to a movie."</p>
<p>To Hazel in the little town of Irving in the Republican Valley
the dust was more severe for she was nearer the source of the
storms. It came in clouds, a scourge rolling eastward like
reddish-yellow gas across no man's land. Too long in the country
farther west had men torn at the earth's vitals,--too many times
had the edge of the plow gone into the lands which were meant for
grazing. There were sections out beyond Irving and in the
neighboring states where schools were closed, traffic paralyzed,
business suspended, street lights shining all day through the
murky atmosphere.</p>
<p>To Neal and his father on the farm it was a season of worry
and discouragement. To what extent were the dust storms affecting
them? Were they bringing in enough sandy soil to damage the rich
loamy Holms' lands? Was soil erosion to be serious?</p>
<p>Day after day the clouds of dust rolled in from the Panhandle
district, northwestern Oklahoma, southeastern Colorado, part of
Kansas.</p>
<p>To old Amalia there was no great discouragement,--no deep
worry. Too many years had she lived with a Nature that was
changeable, as coquettish as a girl.</p>
<p>Too often had she seen rains after drouth, green after the
brown of burning, buds after dried stalks, stillness after the
strife of storm, life after apparent death. "It vill come all
right," she nodded with calm conviction. "It alvays comes right
again."</p>
<p>And it came right again. The winds ceased. Snow fell like a
white benediction over the wind-torn land. Rains
followed,--prolonged soaking rains. The grass grew lush in the
pastures. Cattle stood knee-deep in moisture-covered forage. Buds
burst forth from the elms, the fruit trees and the lilac hedge.
Crocuses bloomed in sheltered spots. The timber-land gave forth
the rich, pungent smell of water-soaked undergrowth. Nature's
face had the look of a freshly scrubbed child. It was the
eighty-sixth miracle Amalia had witnessed.</p>
<p>Neal spent a certain Saturday and part of one Sunday with
Hazel at her home in Lincoln, taking her back to her school at
Irving in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Carter and Lucile were satisfied with Neal,--liked his energy
and his gay humor, his steady blue eyes that looked clean and
frank. Of the boys that had ever squired Hazel about, they liked
him by far the best they agreed when the two had gone.</p>
<p>It was not until they were well out on the paved highway
toward the valley that Neal broached the subject with which he
was to confront Hazel to-day, for which he had chosen this very
time.</p>
<p>He approached it with a bit of trepidation for he had no idea
how she would take it, and because he felt that uncertainty, he
was blunt in the telling. Now that his year of helping his father
was nearly at an end he had decided to forget law and stay on to
manage the farm.</p>
<p>Hazel, assuming for a time that he was joking, was later
filled with sudden alarm to discover that he was in deadly
earnest.</p>
<p>"I've kidded myself into thinking I was there for just the
year. I'm staying. I like the independence of it. I've grown
interested in our plans. Besides, I'd have had a heck of a time
getting on in the other, what with the thousands of us turned
loose and lining the sidewalks waiting for cases."</p>
<p>Because Hazel sat quietly, looking coldly down the highway, he
went rambling on rather indefinitely: "You'll like it there . . .
not a half bad old place . . . with a little care the lawn looks
quite like a park . . . a lot of grand old trees my grandfather
planted . . . the house is sturdy and big even if it's old . . .
Father and Mother will turn it over to us and live in the small
house with Grandma."</p>
<p>He glanced at her but she was stony-faced, so that he went on
nervously with his explanations: "This is a business all ready
and waiting for me,--not a dub job of looking up references for
some older man or starving to death behind my own shingle. And if
you don't think it calls for as much of a business head as any
other, it's just because you don't know your onions or any of the
other crops."</p>
<p>Hazel spoke for the first time. "I just can't <i>see</i>
myself. That's all there is to it. Just don't speak about it
again and kindly drop the whole idea."</p>
<p>"But I <i>am</i> speaking about it. And I'm not dropping the
whole idea, kindly, benevolently, or otherwise."</p>
<p>"You can't mean that you're in earnest about this crazy
notion?"</p>
<p>"I'm in earnest . . . and the notion is so sensible it should
take the Pulitzer prize for wisdom. Three hundred and twenty
acres of the best and richest land in Nebraska with my Dad ready
and willing to turn the management of it to me. To be sure, one
of the eighties has a big plaster on it, but we can soak that
off. We lost two other eighties in the late lamented depression.
I'd be a nut to stick out a shingle in some little burg or run
errands for a law firm in a bigger town just as agriculture is
going to pull out."</p>
<p>"I don't see it."</p>
<p>"And <i>I</i> <i>do."</i></p>
<p>They were speaking with suppressed heat, firecrackers
sputtering under ice.</p>
<p>"And you call this an ambitious idea?"</p>
<p>"About as ambitious a move as I've ever made in my life." His
voice dropped to a pleading tone. "I'm terribly in earnest,
Hazel. Give me credit for growing up and making my own decisions.
You know every one who has any stamina . . . There's another word
but not so pretty . . . Drop around some day and I'll tell you
what it is . . . Any fellow who hasn't lard in his veins has to
map out his own life and his own work. Well, mine's running that
big farm and running it <i>right.</i> I know it now for sure. I
feel energetic about it, enthusiastic, with a hundred plans of
things to do. It's my best bet because I <i>want</i> to do it.
There was a time when I wouldn't have said that I ever would. I
know my own mind now."</p>
<p>"And apparently that broad mind of yours doesn't comprehend
that I'd have anything to say about it,--that I should be the one
to make the decision."</p>
<p>"You can put it that way, of course, to make me feel quite the
villain. But I'll have to be more honest than gallant and admit
that in this particular thing . . . you shouldn't."</p>
<p>"One could imagine . . . the casual observer maybe . . . that
I <i>would</i> have the deciding vote."</p>
<p>"I've seen how that works out, Hazel. You don't need to get me
wrong,--I think the world of my mother. But she just had her way
with my dad in a lot of things he should have decided for them
both. Well, it nearly got them."</p>
<p>"I'd make a <i>scalding-</i>hot farmer's wife, wouldn't
I?"</p>
<p>"Sure you would. You'd . . ."</p>
<p>"I don't know a silo from a centipede . . ."</p>
<p>"A centipede has more legs than a silo, dearie. You can always
tell them that way." Now that she was talking he felt easier.</p>
<p>". . . or oats from wheat."</p>
<p>"Wheat has a beard, honey,--whiskers like old man Briggs."</p>
<p>But Hazel would not meet his flippant conversation. "I tell
you, I don't know <i>anything</i> about it. I don't know a plow
from a harron . . . harrall . . . harrow . . . whatever it
is."</p>
<p>"For that matter, would you have known a rejoinder or a
summons or a brief if I'd have gone into law?"</p>
<p>"I could learn."</p>
<p>"You can learn this other."</p>
<p>There were icicles in the air now. Hazel stared straight ahead
into the diminishing point of the paved highway. Neal, face
solemn and jaw set, leaned over and turned on the radio.</p>
<p>"Ah'll call you back in a few minutes, Kingfish. Amos 'n I has
got a big business man in here . . ." He snapped it off
petulantly.</p>
<p>For a mile they rode in frosty silence.</p>
<p>Hazel broke it with sarcasm. "So you really think I'd move on
a farm . . . that I would give in to you about this wild
thing?"</p>
<p>"Do I get it that you've not at any time cared for me,
myself,--that you've merely liked the smug little idea of
marrying a man who sat in a mahogany-furnished office in a
downtown business block . . ."</p>
<p>"Maybe I have. Maybe I think that's the sort of environment
I'd like to have my husband in."</p>
<p>". . . so that you could have a nice plate-glass window to sit
in and see the Shriner's parade go by?"</p>
<p>The car had accelerated in speed with Neal's rising temper.
They were passing through Niles Center, such a small village that
the general store, the post office, and the filling-station
flashed by like bits of colored posters. They were both silent,
agitated and uncomfortable. It did not add anything, therefore,
to the gayety of the nations when the Niles Center constable
overtook them. When they stopped, he came over to the car, a big,
red-faced man with a curiously small button-like nose set in the
full moon of his face.</p>
<p>"Where you think you are--Indianapolis speedway or Ormond
Beach or some place?"</p>
<p>"I didn't even see your sissy town," Neal retorted. And for
the pleasure he derived from the saying donated unwillingly a
five-dollar bill toward the erecting of a new village
bandstand.</p>
<p>For the rest of the trip they were silent, excepting for an
occasional remark that had neither interest nor entertainment for
either one.</p>
<p>The long paved highway passed through fields and orchards of
the peaceful Republican River Valley. Acres of green wheat on
every side lay shrouded in the soft cool evening. From the
alfalfa fields came the fragrance of the budding blossoms,--from
the pastures the faint odor of meadow-grass lush with moisture.
Only a few weeks before the great billows of dust had enveloped
the valley. Wind had blown eerily out of the west. Dirty gray
clouds had scudded across yellow skies. Then as though the
Caretaker had said: "Thus far shalt thou go and no farther," the
winds had ceased and like a benign benediction had come the
rains. The Republican Valley was as peaceful now as a lovely lady
with emerald pastures and wheatfields for jewels.</p>
<p>They drove into the town of Irving and turned to the street
upon which Hazel's boarding-house stood. Neither one knew how the
strained interview was to terminate,--both were
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Neal slid up to the curb where a low barberry hedge scraped
across the running board. Because they were serious and angry and
uncertain what the next move was to be, in the embarrassment of
the moment they did nothing,--merely sat, each waiting for the
other to speak.</p>
<p>At once three of Hazel's little girl pupils, arm in arm,
passed along the street and giggled at the sight of their teacher
sitting with a strange young man.</p>
<p>"Hello, Miss Meier."</p>
<p>"Hello, Miss Meier."</p>
<p>"Hello, Miss Meier."</p>
<p>"People all speak the same dialect here." Neal tried to assume
his old light way. But because Hazel would not smile, he dropped
it immediately. "Well, I guess there's nothing more to say,
excepting where do we go from here?"</p>
<p>"I guess that's not going to be hard to interpret."</p>
<p>"You mean . . . ?"</p>
<p>"I most certainly do . . . under the circumstances . . . if
they still exist . . . we're through."</p>
<p>"They exist all right. I'll say just one thing more. You've
probably had a fond and kiddish notion you were about to marry a
member of the United States Supreme Court. Well, you weren't. You
were about to marry a young fellow who was going to have a long,
slippery climb,--and if you won't do this with him now which is a
wise move, you wouldn't have liked the monotony of the other,
either,--so it's a good thing for us both you found it out in
time. But you can rest assured he will get somewhere a darned
sight faster doing the thing he wants to do.</p>
<p>"Become Secretary of Agriculture, maybe." Hazel hated her own
sarcasm, even while she gave vent to it.</p>
<p>"Maybe . . . who knows? Stranger things have happened."</p>
<p>"Well . . ." he said again after a strained silence, ". . .
let's don't prolong the death pangs."</p>
<p>At that, Hazel was out before he could get around to the door.
But he walked along stubbornly by her side to the porch, carrying
her small bag, and because he was bursting with hurt and
disappointment, he said: "This is the way Emily Post says all
engagements should be terminated,--politely and with subtle
grace."</p>
<p>But at the door, he broke: "Hazel . . . we're just talking to
hear ourselves say words. We're both that way . . . we just enjoy
the ragging. Neither one of us meant anything but to bark our
heads off. There's no one I could ever love but you,--no one in
the world for me but <i>you."</i> And would have put his arms
around her, but that she said with infinite sarcasm: "Oh, yes,
there is. There's <i>you."</i> And was gone into the house,
shutting the door with infinite pains.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c38" id="c38">CHAPTER XXXVIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Spring rains, heavy, drenching, filling the creek-beds and
flooding the lowlands!</p>
<p>They beat upon the Holms' fields and pastures sending moisture
down to the grateful sub-soil which had been so long without it,
while Neal worked doggedly all day, tight-lipped and serious. So
recently life had been such a gay and happy thing,--now so void
of interest without funny flippant letters, so dull appearing in
the future with no plans involving the constant presence of a
merry redheaded girl.</p>
<p>They beat steadily and drowsily upon the little white-painted
cottage of old Amalia, piecing her Around-the-World quilt and
listening to news from places of which she had never heard. They
beat upon the old German country church high on the knoll and the
sodden grasses of all the old Kratz and Schaffer graves, and
those of the Gebhardts and Rhodenbachs who had come into the
prairie together over sixty years before.</p>
<p>They beat upon the apartment building in Lincoln, where Carter
and Lucile Meier lived, trying to get along on an absurdly small
amount so that they could begin saving again in their fifties for
old age. And they beat upon the stone mausoleum covering Matthias
Meier and his wife Ida in <i>Wyuka</i> which is the Indian word
for a place to lie down and sleep.</p>
<p>Out in the Republican Valley in the little town of Irving the
rains beat on Hazel Meier going back and forth in her tan-colored
raincoat and cap to school, trying to keep her mind on lesson
plans, on hard work, on an interview with the superintendent in
which she was to tell him she had changed her mind and was
withdrawing her resignation if they would still consider her for
next year.</p>
<p>Life was a strange thing now,--all the loveliness of it had
vanished, leaving nothing but school work. Beyond the moment she
would not look, merely putting her energies and thoughts into the
day's teaching.</p>
<p>This morning she took time at recess to scribble a few lines
to her parents, making them as gay as though life were still a
pleasant thing. They had experienced enough trouble,--she would
carry this break with Neal through with head high. She mailed her
letter at noon and changed her dress to a fresher one, for she
was going out to the Johnson's with Marie, one of her pupils, for
supper. They lived out of town, so she was going to have the
experience of riding in the school bus. Marie and Katie were both
in her room,--Katie had been out sick, was convalescing and
wanted "Teacher" to come out for supper. Mr. Johnson would bring
her back in the Ford, or if it should rain too hard, she was to
stay all night.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, "Teacher" was going to be distinctly
bored and would have preferred going to her own rooming-house
where at least she knew what to expect. A pupil's home was always
and distinctly <i>X,</i> the unknown quantity. But as she told
Miss Evans of the fourth grade, "hers not to question why, hers
but to do or die."</p>
<p>When evening came, the school bus occupants were thrilled to
death that Miss Meier was entering their chariot for the time
being, seven girls wanting to sit by her, and virtually all the
boys taking part in voluntary exercises of standing on their
heads, cat-calls, and baboon-like climbings up the side of the
windows in order to display masculine prowess in front of
feminine charm.</p>
<p>Arrived at her destination she found the Johnson's abode was
just about what she would have expected from personal appearances
made all year by Katie and Marie. The sitting-room had a cheap
rug with eye-puncturing red roses which Mrs. Johnson told her Mr.
Johnson surprised her with at Christmas, picking it from the
catalogue, "hisself," to which the convalescing Katie added the
information that to-day in honor of Teacher they took off the
newspapers and rag rugs they always kept over it.</p>
<p>While Mrs. Johnson prepared her supper, the intervening time
for Hazel was occupied by a protracted sitting on the couch with
a girl on either side and the little brother in a state of
doubtful stickiness leaning on her knees, all enjoying a
never-ending entertainment of stereoscopic views of such titles
as "Niagara by Moonlight," "Lake Erie in a Storm" and a
side-splitting one of "We Three Donkeys," the big joke being that
whoever looked at the picture was <i>one</i> of them. "That
caught you, didn't it, Teacher?"</p>
<p>Supper was ready. Mrs. Johnson was hot and flurried,
forgetting to bring on her biscuits for a time. Mr. Johnson was
there, just in from the milking, scrubbed and combed. The hired
man was there, a queer crooked-nosed individual with one eye
slightly turned.</p>
<p>"Mr. Nils Jensen, Miss Meier."</p>
<p>"Pleased to meetcha."</p>
<p>There was some delay caused by the little boy's insistent
demand that he sit by Teacher, too, but the girls were adamant
over their personal ownership, and Nils with rare diplomacy put a
quietus on the disturbance by reaching for a hot sparerib and
bestowing it upon the trouble-maker.</p>
<p>It rained most of the evening. Hazel stayed all night, for
which Katie and Marie gave evidence they would eventually lord it
over the other girls in their room, for not once had Teacher
stayed all night at any of their homes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson loaned Hazel her wedding nightgown,--a
high-necked lace-yoked affair with blue ribbons pulled through
the holes. Teacher was to have the spare room downstairs,--all
the others were to sleep on the second floor. The bed had
starched pillow-cases with brown cat-tails and yellow
water-lilies embroidered on the ends. Some of the mercury behind
the mirror on the dresser was off so one could see the wall-paper
through it. The last thing Mrs. Johnson said was: "I do hope you
sleep good, Miss Meier. They ain't nobody slep' in here since
Grandpa died in this bed."</p>
<p>Hazel got into the erstwhile deathbed, in the ruffled wedding
nightgown, laughed a little, thinking of all the funny things she
would tell Neal when she saw him,--remembered, and watered the
starched cat-tails with a few tears. It did not seem possible
that Life could be so miserable and so uninteresting.</p>
<p>She must have been asleep a long time for it seemed near
daylight when she heard noises.</p>
<p>"Miss Meier." It resolved itself into her name and some one
pounding on her door.</p>
<p>"Yes?" She was sitting up, alarmed: not so much at the
disturbance itself as at what it might portend.</p>
<p>"Get up and dress quick." It was Mr. Johnson. "There's water
comin' in through the kitchen door,--the whole yard looks under
water."</p>
<p>She sprang out of bed in a daze of sleepiness and
uncertainty.</p>
<p>Water! Well, what of it? The first of the spring had been dry
and dusty. Every one had wanted water. And now they had it. Never
satisfied. What was the big commotion about? Water never hurt
you,--when you were in a house, it didn't.</p>
<p>She realized her mind was not quite lucid, that her very fear
of this unknown thing which had given Mr. Johnson's voice its
anxious tone was making her a bit panicky.</p>
<p>She got out of the beribboned wedding nightgown and dressed in
a fumbling sort of way, as though in one of those dreams where
you couldn't get your clothes on. Her step-ins were wrong side
out,--well, no matter. What a ghastly time of morning to get
up,--scarcely light.</p>
<p>She could hear a queer swish, swish, a liquid gurgling sound
that was not quite right. Some way it just did not seem to belong
in a house. There were voices,--Mr. Johnson's,--Mrs. Johnson's.
Children crying,--Marie and Katie and the little boy. The hired
man was calling,--the hired man with the crossed eye and the
crooked nose. A door was banging, too. And through all the other
noises that constant swish--swish--swish!</p>
<p>Hose next, never mind the seams. What was the matter with
every one? Pumps next. Her brown one-piece dress over her head.
Did Mr. Johnson mean they were going away,--going to get out of
the house on account of some water? Then she had better put on
her beret and jacket, for it was chilly.</p>
<p>She pulled her gay orange beret over her hair, and with
scarcely any volition of her own looked at her dim image in the
dresser glass from which part of the mercury was missing, gave
the beret a pert slant, and reached for her jacket.</p>
<p>Swish, swish--</p>
<p>No! No! Water couldn't do that,--couldn't come slithering
under your bedroom door in long creeping lines.</p>
<p>Voices again. Mr. Johnson's. Mrs. Johnson's, this time,
calling excitedly: "Miss Meier, are you dressed?" They were
anxious for her to come. The children were crying again.</p>
<p>She stared at the long creeping lines under the
door--coming--coming--</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm dressed."</p>
<p>Something fearful which ought not to be happening--was
happening anyway. Water slipping that way, snake-like, over your
bedroom floor.</p>
<p>She tiptoed over the long ribbon-like lines and opened the
door. Mr. Johnson had the convalescing Katie in his arms. Mrs.
Johnson had Marie and the little boy by the hands. The water
snaked and slipped all over the sitting-room, over the fat red
and green Axminster roses and under the cheap upright piano. It
oozed around the basket of stereopticon views under the center
table, and Mrs. Johnson tiptoed through it and set them up on the
stand.</p>
<p>The stair door stood open. Mr. Johnson was pushing his wife
ahead of him toward it and telling the children to hurry
along.</p>
<p>The water ran everywhere now,--bolder and more of it.
Tiptoeing didn't do much good,--the red roses were almost
obliterated. Some one was pounding or sawing upstairs.</p>
<p>"Shan't we get in the car?" She didn't know whether she
whispered or shouted it. "And drive away from this?"</p>
<p>"There's no way," Mr. Johnson said shortly. "It's a regular
river . . . everywhere."</p>
<p>"Down the highway?"</p>
<p>"Can't see the highway."</p>
<p>They went up the narrow stairs, the children thumping loudly
in their heavy, unlaced shoes.</p>
<p>It seemed good to be up here where everything was dry. It was
queer, though, to be in these strange upstairs rooms with a Mr.
and Mrs. Johnson whom you did not know well,--the beds not
made,--clothes scattered about,--a teddy-bear hanging over the
side of a crib.</p>
<p>She knew now what had been making the noise up here. The hired
man was cutting a hole in the ceiling of the smallest bedroom.
For heaven's sake . . . he didn't think . . . ?</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry . . ." Mrs. Johnson said through her tightly
closed teeth. There was a frozen sort of attitude about her,
trying to be polite as on the evening before, but frightened to
death. "So sorry . . . for this . . . when you come, Miss Meier.
So good to see about Katie . . . You could be . . . in the dry .
. . there in Irving."</p>
<p>Yes, why had she picked to-day . . . no, yesterday, to come
out here? Why do people do queer things . . . on certain dates?
Grandpa used to say no one knew whether it was Providence or Lady
Luck or the Spinning Fates.</p>
<p>Any other previous night on which she might have chosen to
come out here to see her pupil, this water-in-the-house accident
never would have occurred.</p>
<p>But that was always the way,--no matter what happened, people
never knew it was <i>going</i> to happen, and so they were always
caught doing just the ordinary things of life. That was why they
had found the people of the Pompeiian ruins in front of ovens and
at the bath and asleep. Heavens, that was a cheerful thought to
drag in just now,--the ruins of Pompeii. Lots of catastrophes in
the world. You read about them in the papers. People trapped in
queer ways. It always seemed so senseless and stupid when you
were reading it. "What were they <i>doing</i> there?" you always
said. Perhaps they couldn't help it. Perhaps they were sometimes
caught. But nothing could happen here a mile out of Irving,
Nebraska, in the peaceful Republican Valley, in this day and age,
with electricity and radios and telephones and automobiles and .
. .</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson came back from the stairway. His eyes looked
frightened and his face above the sandy mustache was ashy white.
"It's a lot higher," he said quietly.</p>
<p>Hazel slipped back to look down the well of the stairway and
felt a definite illness at the sight. The dark water lapped and
slapped against the third or fourth stair,--a chair floated,
lightly hitting the door jamb back and forth with little
insistent taps, and a fat red pin-cushion bobbed about like a
bright-colored floater on an invisible fish-line.</p>
<p>She went back to the Johnsons and the hired man with the
cross-eyes and the crooked nose.</p>
<p>"Don't stand, Miss Meier. Sit down." Even yet Mrs. Johnson's
hospitality had not forsaken her.</p>
<p>It was queer how quiet every one was. Even the children,
sensing something beyond them, stopped crying and only clung to
their parents. The little boy wanted his teddy, and Hazel slipped
into the tumbled bedroom and brought it to him. She pulled Marie
onto her lap, keeping her arms around her. She felt close to
these strange Johnsons, closer to them than to most of her
friends. When we get out of here, I'll always be their friend,
she thought,--I'll come out often to see them.</p>
<p>It was gray daylight now. One could see out of the small
bedroom windows,--if one had the temerity to look.</p>
<p>Water! Water rushing through the barnyard. She could tell it
was the barnyard for the big barn still stood there, even though
a hayrack and a lumber-wagon floated with the current.</p>
<p>The high foundation was stone or cement and the upper part was
frame, probably painted the usual barn red. In the gray dawn only
a little of the white stone was still showing so that it looked
like a fat old lady holding up her skirts from the wet. As she
looked, a horse floundered through the water, head up, swimming,
thrashing about for solid ground. A chicken-coop whirled crazily
about with an old hen and chickens squatted precariously on
top.</p>
<p>And now the water seemed rushing harder. There was more of a
current. Mr. Johnson went back to the stairway. "My God!" They
all heard him. "On the roof!" he called as he ran back.</p>
<p>He helped his wife up on a chair which he placed on the
flat-topped bureau. She looked funny trying to squeeze her heavy
bulk through the hole that Nils had sawed out. That is, she
<i>would</i> have looked so if the world hadn't suddenly lost all
its fun.</p>
<p>When she was through, Mr. Johnson helped the sick Katie up the
same way. Then the little boy. Then Marie. "Hang to Mamma tight,"
he said each time.</p>
<p>"Now, you . . . Miss Meier." Mr. Johnson took hold of her, and
the cross-eyed Nils steadied the chair on the bureau. No one said
anything. One couldn't believe that people would stay so quiet
under stress.</p>
<p>Hazel pulled herself through the hole and worked her way close
to Mrs. Johnson and the children. The roof was wet and sloping
and she had to be very careful to keep her footing.</p>
<p>It was frightening out here,--much more so than in the house.
The height of the roof, the great puffy clouds billowing so close
overhead, the dark rushing water below! It made her feel a
distinct nausea, and very chilly. She was shaking uncontrollably.
It was noisier here, too. One couldn't know that water would make
so much noise,--whirling, sucking, rushing.</p>
<p>Much of the time she felt dazed, as though she were an
onlooker at something of which she was not a part. It was a movie
on the screen and the suspense would soon be over. Or a bad dream
and after awhile she would awaken. But the nightmare persisted.
The movie went on, reel after reel.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson came up through the hole and then Nils, his
cross-eyes appearing grotesquely above the aperture, then his
crooked nose.</p>
<p>"If it once on its foundation stays yet a'ready," he
volunteered.</p>
<p><i>If</i> <i>it stays</i> . . . ! The house? Whatever put that
silly notion in his head? Houses always stayed where they were
built. Of course it would stay.</p>
<p>Pigs went by, tumbling along right side up or upside
down,--anyway. Chicken-coops. A wagon-box with a dog standing
shiveringly in it. A hayrack still partly loaded. And then . . .
"Oh, don't look, Mrs. Johnson"--a woman on a house roof,
clinging, crying, calling out to them. A woman on a house <i>that
had not stayed on its foundation.</i></p>
<p>Helpless, they watched her whirled on through the flood
waters.</p>
<p>And now Hazel knew. They, too, might be whirled away with the
current.</p>
<p>"Daddy, I'm cold," little Marie was saying. Without a word Mr.
Johnson slipped off his coat to put around her.</p>
<p>"How about you, Katie?" Nils wanted to know. "Mebbe you have
Nils' coat, huh?" And that came off, too.</p>
<p>Hazel was thinking about people,--homely, uninteresting
people, people to whom she had never given a second thought. How
different they seemed when you knew them,--when you were on a wet
roof with them and the whole world had turned to water.</p>
<p>And now rain fell. The water below whirled by with that
peculiar rushing, sucking noise. Water from the skies beat upon
them. They cowered under its pommeling force. Mrs. Johnson,
clinging to the wetness of the roof, bent her body low over Katie
who had been sick, shielding her as best she could from the
onslaught. Mr. Johnson held Marie in his arms.</p>
<p>"Don't let go of Jimmie a minute, Nils."</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>They clung to the roof over which the water ran, while water
from the sky pounded them, and water below rushed darkly past.
There was no solidity in anything. The world had gone mad, for
everything in it was liquid. There was no world at all,--nothing
but water.</p>
<p>Then the rain ceased. They could move their stiffened bodies
slightly, pull the soaked clothing away from cold beaten flesh,
push sodden hair from their eyes, change the position of aching
bones.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson broke the long silence.</p>
<p>"You all right, Mama?" cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm all right?" quietly.</p>
<p>"You all right, Miss Meier?"</p>
<p>"Yes, thank you."</p>
<p>"Too bad . . . by golly . . . when you come to see us so
good."</p>
<p>"I want to go back in our house" from the little boy. The
girls were crying.</p>
<p>Nils cracked a joke for them. "Don't make more water wid
tears, girls. We got enough water already yet,--huh?"</p>
<p>And now there was some conversation,--all with one import.
Some one would get them. There would be people out in boats. Not
for long would the neighbors let them stay here.</p>
<p>Neighbors! Mr. Johnson looked up and down the valley. The
waters ran darkly as far as he could see. A wagon-box went by,--a
horse swimming with the current. Small objects bobbed up and down
here and there,--a chicken-coop, boxes, boards.</p>
<p>And then it happened,--the sickening thing which made of Hazel
a mad young woman whose eyes would not believe their seeing, nor
her ears their hearing, nor any sense function sanely. It all
came quickly with crashing, horrible sounds and wrenching
movements of the only solid thing in the world. Under them
somewhere, solidity moved and dipped and whirled in circular
fashion. Mrs. Johnson screamed and clutched the air. Katie was
thrown into the gray space. Then Mr. Johnson holding to Marie and
grabbing for Katie. Bodies hurtled off the turning building.
Staring, uncomprehending, she saw Marie's pink dress for a moment
before it sank. Mr. Johnson, his face in the water a dead white
mask, came up, swam a way,--and she looked no more.</p>
<p>The roof to which she clung was moving down the current. Nils,
too, was clinging near her, his arm still around the little boy
who was crying loudly.</p>
<p>"Where did Daddy and Mamma go? I want to go in my house."</p>
<p>"Sh, darling. You're all right. Nils and I will take care of
you."</p>
<p>And now the roof under the three went on down the stream,
sometimes dipping a little, sometimes whirling in a
cross-current. Hazel knew there was no further fear to which she
could be subjected than this. She had reached the depths of
terror. This was the end of fear, for it was the end of life
itself.</p>
<p>But there was one more dread. Nils told her about
it,--cautioned her about what to do. The house was making for the
top of a grove of trees, or apparently so,--one couldn't tell,
for it was subject to so many cross-currents. If it caught in the
trees, it might be their salvation. On the other hand, if it
struck with force, tree branches could sweep them off into the
water. If the house approached it, she was to use all her wits
about avoiding that,--was to lie flat, face downward. He would
hold Jimmie tightly down by him.</p>
<p>Now, all of life consisted of knowing whether this was to
happen or not. They moved, dipped fearfully, swayed, whirled
sickeningly. The grove was to the right, no, straight ahead of
them,--to the right again. Now it loomed up in front of them.
Green dripping foliage and gnarled brown branches were there
straight ahead. She pulled her beret down tightly over her ears
and lay flat down, face concealed in an arm, clung tightly with
one hand, and crooked the other elbow over the roof ridge. The
branches swept her, tore at her skirt and jacket and hose. Heavy
rain-drops shaken from them pelted her.</p>
<p>When all motion had ceased, she raised her head into the twigs
and leaves of a tree top. Protecting her face, she peered
through. Nils and Jimmie had withstood the impact, too. Jimmie
was beyond the crying stage now, lay supinely on the wet roof,
tired out, his teddy-bear in his arms.</p>
<p>"If once it holds together and don't go to crackin' up already
yet," Nils volunteered.</p>
<p>Sometimes he climbed carefully from branch to branch trying to
see out better, sighting their location. Sometimes he crawled
stealthily about the roof top looking over into the dark waters.
Often he shouted, his voice, used to hog-calling, echoing across
the waters.</p>
<p>She marveled at his patience with Jimmie. There was a place
where a stout branch had wedged itself across the roof. Against
this he placed the child who slept now on his hard, wet bed.</p>
<p>Time wore on and she did not know whether it was minutes or
hours that went by. Whatever it was it had no end. It was
eternity. There was no sight but green branches and water,--no
human sounds but their own.</p>
<p>Jimmie woke and cried with hunger.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was early afternoon,--they could not tell for the
sun was hidden in the gray of the clouds,--that Nils came to his
decision to swim,--he would go downstream with the current
working gradually toward the right. He knew the gamble of it, but
he was assuming it stoically.</p>
<p>"If I get there, I bring help. If I don't, we ain't no worse
off anyway, huh?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Nils . . . are you going to? I don't think I can look
after Jimmie and hang on, too."</p>
<p>"Yah . . . you can all right. You're a strong girl. Betcha you
play that there tennis."</p>
<p>He stripped to underwear, felt his way carefully from branch
to branch, looked back: "If . . . I don't make it . . . and
you're found all right . . . would you get word to my ma on the
Missouri mud flats just below Omaha . . . Mrs. Christine
Jensen?"</p>
<p>"I would, Nils . . . oh, I <i>would.</i> But you'll get
there."</p>
<p>"Yah . . . I'll get there . . . maybe."</p>
<p>"Good luck, Nils."</p>
<p>Nils was gone into the dark waters. She could hear the steady
splash of his strokes and then the sound ceased.</p>
<p>And now there was no such thing as time,--nothing but pain in
one's wrists and fingers, and a wet numb body that would soon
fail to function.</p>
<p>Now there was nothing but a clinging to the wet roof wedged in
the branches that still swayed sickeningly with the
current,--watching the orphaned child sleeping there against the
heavy limb, ready to grab for him if, as Nils had suggested, the
roof might break up with the pounding. Nothing to do but cling
and pray,--watch and think.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c39" id="c39">CHAPTER XXXIX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Neal was having the experience of a puncture a half-mile from
home with the exasperating knowledge that he had taken the jack
out to use for his father's car and failed to put it back. With a
few choice epithets directed exclusively toward himself, he
started down the highway toward home,--a paved highway now. And
although he gave no thought to that fact, so used was he to it,
if he had done so, he could have called the roll of the various
periods through which that highway had progressed. Pathless
prairie grass. Grassy road. Dirt road from which all sign of
green had vanished. Graveled highway. Pavement. In the valley,
the evolution of that road was the history of the people who
lived beside it.</p>
<p>He had not gone but a few paces until a roadster drew up and a
woman called to him. "Hello, hitch-hiker."</p>
<p>"Oh, hello, Miss Schaffer." The trained nurse from Omaha who
came sometimes to the valley to visit her brother.</p>
<p>He rode to the gate with her. She was immaculate, well
groomed, exuded freshness.</p>
<p>"So you're going to marry a University girl, Neal?"</p>
<p>"'So you <i>were</i> going to' is a little more appropriate
now."</p>
<p>"Oh, Neal . . . I'm sorry I bungled."</p>
<p>"That's all right. You can't keep news like that in cold
storage,--not in this neck of the woods anyway."</p>
<p>It took such a moment for a half-mile's drive. Rose Schaffer
wished that it might have been longer. "Believe me, Neal, I hope
. . . with all my heart whatever happens to you, it will be for
the best."</p>
<p>"Thanks--for the interest."</p>
<p>He might have shown his surprise at her words more than he
intended, for she laughed, then said quickly: "You know how old
maids are, incorrigibly romantic. And besides, they say I helped
save your life once when you were a small codger, so I've a right
to be interested in your welfare."</p>
<p>As he turned into the graveled driveway, old Amalia came to
the door of her little house and peered out.</p>
<p>"Evidently laying for me," Neal said to himself.</p>
<p>She looked so tiny standing there just at the stoop's edge,
her hands holding to the door jamb to steady herself.</p>
<p>"Joey!" She was calling to him and motioning.</p>
<p>Neal walked up the path toward her cottage to see what she
wanted. It made no difference which name she used,--Joe or
Neal,--whichever one was nearer to her responded. Sometimes she
called them "Emil" or "Fritz," too. No one ever corrected
her.</p>
<p>"Der iss news," she called.</p>
<p>She was at it again. Well, he would have to humor her.</p>
<p>Ships in trouble far out at sea and Omaha shoe sales, talk of
foreign wars, and the local grain elevator's receipts, deaths of
people of whom she had never heard, and the five babies all at
one time in Canada,--they were all exciting to her, one of as
much consequence as another. It gave her a sense of importance to
tell it and have them listen as though interested.</p>
<p>Always when a news period was ended she came to her door to
see if there was some one to whom she could call out what she had
just heard. Two or three items out of the whole list were all she
could remember. Sometimes she garbled those until they were no
news at all. Usually she was a bit of a nuisance with any of it.
But they tried to be patient,--she was so palpably pleased at the
telling.</p>
<p>Neal had to laugh to himself now as he walked toward her. The
little news-hound, he thought, her own radio certainly had given
her a new lease on life.</p>
<p>"Well, did a man bite a dog, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"No. . . . So long as I am living, Joey, a man biting a dog I
never knew. But do not get me off . . . or already I forget.
Neal, dere iss trouble by de big rains. Rivers go over. Towns iss
swept away. People iss in trees hanging. Railroads iss gone. All
iss water where vas de farms."</p>
<p>"Where, Grandma? In Hong-Kong, Czechoslovakia, or
Tasmania?"</p>
<p>"No. Close by . . . I remember. It was in de Valley of de
Republican River. Some folks ve know in pioneer days by name
Weitzal stayed at our house and vent on to de Valley of de
Republican. Dey had to sleep on de floor. I remember, dey had
dere own bedding . . ."</p>
<p>Neal was not laughing at Grandma now, nor listening to her
prattle of a family by the name of Weitzal in pioneer days who
had to sleep on the floor on their own bedding.</p>
<p>He was standing in the path and scowling at her. "What towns,
Grandma? What towns are swept away?"</p>
<p>"I forget vich, Joey. Alvays I forget . . ."</p>
<p>"Was Irving one? Try hard to remember."</p>
<p>"It sounds so, Neal. Irwing? . . . Yes . . . I tink . . ."</p>
<p>Neal turned and went into the big house, still scowling. He
felt a curious fright that he could not shake off. It was silly,
too, for Grandma was so unreliable. Probably the catastrophe was
in Oregon instead of Nebraska,--maybe it was fire instead of
water,--and a few other points of misinformation. Maybe she had
heard part of a play. Several times she had mistaken one for a
real happening. One morning she had come all the way over to the
house in her slow way to tell them about a group of people being
lost in the desert and it proved to have been one of the Death
Valley plays.</p>
<p>But he went to the 'phone and called for information. Yes, it
was true. There was a flood of gigantic proportions over a large
area of the Republican Valley . . . probably several hundred
lives lost . . . millions of property damage.</p>
<p>"How about the town . . ." his throat was dry, ". . . the town
of Irving?"</p>
<p>News was meager, but that was one of the places reported in a
bad way.</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver, ran to the garage for the jack, went
back to fix his car, drove home, had a hurried bath and change of
clothes, and came down to tell his mother he was driving to
Lincoln and possibly would go on to the flood district.</p>
<p>Myrtie was worried and fearful for him, but he paid no
attention to her complaints, went out to see his father for a
minute, and was gone down the gravel driveway in his
roadster.</p>
<p>In Lincoln he went directly to the Meier apartment. Carter was
home with Lucile,--both worried to distraction. All morning they
had been trying to get in communication with Irving or some point
near there. The town was as isolated as a foreign planet.</p>
<p>A plane carrying a newspaper man had gone over and was not
back yet, Carter told Neal.</p>
<p>"A plane,--that's the idea," Neal said. "I'll see if I can go
over that way."</p>
<p>Lucile told Neal about a letter from Hazel that had come in
that morning. It had been scribbled at the morning recess the day
before, mailed at noon, had arrived on the evening train and been
delivered that morning. In it she had mentioned going out to one
of her pupils in the country.</p>
<p>"That probably took her farther away from the river," Neal
said cheerfully. "Or closer," he was thinking.</p>
<p>In the midst of the conversation Hazel's mother suddenly said:
"I've just remembered, Neal . . . I thought you and Hazel . . . ?
She wrote me . . ."</p>
<p>For the first time during these anxious moments Neal gave his
old boyish grin. "I guess I'd forgotten it, too. Officially our
engagement wasn't just what it had been previously. This interest
on my part is off the record."</p>
<p>It relieved them both immensely to laugh. It seemed to assure
each one that Hazel could not help but be all right now.</p>
<p>But they came back to the letter several times. Neal had
Hazel's mother read the part again carefully in which she told of
her movements--a careless little note written with no thought
that a few hours later her family would hang on every word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Am going out to a Johnson family's home this afternoon in the
school bus with my little Marie. (I always think of Booth
Tarkington's Little Marie of Kansas City.) Katie Johnson, also my
professional property, has been sick for several days,--nothing
catching, so don't worry,--and now she's sitting up and Dear
Teacher is invited out to supper,--not dinner,--supper, for which
I have been informed we are having <i>spare-</i>ribs. Papa
Johnson will bring me home afterward, or pending another hard
rain of which we are having no end, I can stay all night in the
<i>spare</i> bedroom. Woodman, <i>spare</i> that tree.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was so like her, gay and flippant, that it brought her
clearly before them all. The three who had been so worried about
her, stood there together, each thinking: "She's all right.
Nothing could have happened to her. To other people out there,
maybe, but not to Hazel."</p>
<p>When he left them, Neal said: "I'll get to her some way. And
I'll get in touch with you as soon as I can. If you don't hear,
don't worry. I'll be driving, walking, flying, or swimming."</p>
<p>They followed him out to the lobby door,--anxious, wanting to
go with him, sending their hearts along.</p>
<p>"Oh, she's all right."</p>
<p>"Yes, as safe as she can be."</p>
<p>"Of course. But I rather think I'll go see for myself.
Good-by."</p>
<p>"Good-by, Neal." It was just a little spat they had, Lucile
was thinking.</p>
<p>"Good-by, Neal." Twenty-four, thought Carter, what wouldn't I
give to be twenty-four again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c40" id="c40">CHAPTER XL</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Clinging--watching--thinking,--life had resolved itself into
these three functions for Hazel. Sometimes it seemed the easiest
thing in the world just to relax and let go. There would be a few
moments of dread, a few moments of swimming with the current,
then oblivion, for she could see nothing within her own swimming
distances to which to go. Clumps of trees, emerging from the
rushing water, another marooned building far in the
distance,--nothing better than the roof to which she must still
cling.</p>
<p>And there was the child, thrown so strangely in her care,
sleeping his troubled, sighing sleep against the wet branch. No
matter how painful the clinging nor how dulled her mind she must
not forsake him.</p>
<p>There was no sound nor sight of help. Nils, then, had failed.
Poor Nils,--so nervy about it all.</p>
<p>In the stillness and the vastness of the flood, then, she grew
deathly frightened, panic-stricken.</p>
<p>Up to now something had sustained her in all the horrible
experience,--that it would soon be over, that some one would
come. But now hope was giving away,--maybe her sanity with it.
She cried out, and the little boy cried too at the sound, so that
she forgot her own fright and comforted him.</p>
<p>His helplessness steadied her, and under her soothing words he
fell again into his troubled slumber.</p>
<p>It seemed late afternoon. Night would soon be coming on. That
would mean death, for she could not cling through the night. Her
thoughts centered on life as she had known it, as though the
thinking could give it back to her. What a glorious thing it was
at its very poorest! The hours she had most disliked,--how she
would welcome them now! The simplest things would give her
pleasure,--the gifts of life we accepted so casually, how
beautiful they were.</p>
<p>Three people centered her life,--Mother, Dad, Neal. She saw
them all as through a long vista. They were standing there at the
end of it waiting for her to come,--were holding out their arms
to her, but she couldn't go because she had to cling to this wet
roof. They held her,--the wet rotting shingles and the green
branches over them, and would not allow her to go where Dad and
Mother and Neal were waiting.</p>
<p>Suddenly she remembered a queer thing her grandfather had said
the last week of his life. He had been asleep, and half waking,
had called out sharply: "Sands! The sucking sands! They hold you
back and will not let you go."</p>
<p>She, too, knew the agony of being held back and not allowed to
go.</p>
<p>And now she felt only an unselfish sympathy for the three she
loved most. She pictured their sorrow until in the torture of it
her mind could no longer stand the thought and turned in anguish
from it.</p>
<p>She and Neal had quarreled about something, so trivial now she
scarcely gave it space in her mind. Dad. Mother. Neal. She said
the names over as a nun says her beads.</p>
<p>She had but those three thoughts, and the thoughts were
prayers. Dad. Mother. Neal. Those, and "God, but give me back my
everyday living and I will use it to the full."</p>
<p>All the extraneous matters of life were swept away with the
flood waters. All the foolish unnecessary things which surrounded
it were vanished from her mind as the fields were vanished from
the landscape. Life was a simple thing of love and work and
courage. Nothing else mattered. To have those, one had
everything.</p>
<p>She dropped her head into her arm, tried to still the
throbbing and the aching of it with a cramped numb hand. But the
pain was sharper,--the throbbing grew loud and louder until it
filled--</p>
<p>She jerked her head from her stiff arm, sat up suddenly.</p>
<p>The throbbing was a plane flying low, circling over the flood
waters,--a great wide-winged bird throbbing its message of hope.
She pulled the now wakened Jimmie to her. She waved, called,
cried out. Jimmie added his three-year-old voice to it. They must
have seen her for they went around her in one complete
circumference of flight, then disappeared rapidly in the
distance.</p>
<p>She could not tell how long the time,--it only seemed
interminable,--until she saw the two boats. They bobbed about
sickeningly at times in the cross-currents. Once it appeared that
one would be swamped. Those who were managing them certainly knew
their business.</p>
<p>"See, Jimmie, the boats are coming for us."</p>
<p>"I know, it's my Daddy."</p>
<p>Hazel hugged him tightly. "No, Jimmie, it isn't Daddy. Jimmie,
have you . . . have you anybody besides Daddy and Mother? Have
you any grandma or aunties?"</p>
<p>"I've got my Grandma Johnson and my Grandma Snell and my Aunt
Callie and my Aunt . . ."</p>
<p>Wet-eyed, she kissed him.</p>
<p>"I'm glad, Jimmie,--more glad than you can ever know."</p>
<p>The first boat came up, bumping against the trees and the
submerged part of a house that had once been a home with a rug of
red roses and stereopticon views and a wedding nightgown.</p>
<p>"Oh, Nils, you did make it . . . and you got some dry clothes
on and came back. How good you are."</p>
<p>Very soon she was to learn of a hundred incidents like that
one, of the reactions of various types of humans under pressure,
of the resourcefulness of the rescued and the rescuers, of
evidences everywhere of the Nebraska pioneer spirit which had not
died out in the third and fourth generations.</p>
<p>She was to know of the rescue of the men marooned for
twenty-four hours on a light plant, and of the big gravel-pumping
raft floating down the river to them as though Providence had
taken a hand in the situation, of the groups clinging to the
roofs of houses and trees saved by heroic deeds, and of others
which vanished into the boiling current. She was to hear of men
rescued from their perilous positions of sixteen hours changing
into dry clothing that they in turn might help, of doctors
braving the torrents to get to isolated districts to bring new
babies into the harassed territory, and of tired women serving
coffee until too worn out to go on.</p>
<p>She was to see the shambles of town homes and farms, the
washed-out paved highway and the twisted railroad tracks with
ties standing as upright as so many fence posts.</p>
<p>It was only later that she was to see the valley peaceful
again and new farm homes go up, villages rebuilt and Nature begin
to cover her ugly scars with verdure.</p>
<p>It took planning and care to get Jimmie safely down into the
first boat. Nils and the man with him pulled away. The second
boat came up then.</p>
<p><i>"Neal."</i></p>
<p>"Hello, Pink-Hair."</p>
<p><i>"Neal . . .</i> where did you come from? Was it you in the
plane?"</p>
<p>"Yes. What do you mean, Woman, by getting stranded on a desert
isle with a cross-eyed man and appearing later with a child?"</p>
<p>And now Hazel was down, too, in a swaying boat which a strange
man was helping Neal handle. And absurdly enough, Hazel was
crying,--sobbing and crying in the reaction of their coming.</p>
<p>Neal comforted her as best he could with the boat unsteady in
the current. She clung to him, a little girl who had looked upon
Death and found it awful.</p>
<p>"Neal,--Katie said she hoped I'd finish reading 'Black Beauty'
when she got back . . ." and she burst again into loud
sobbing.</p>
<p>Hazel snapping come-backs at him as with a rubber sling-shot
was nothing new. Hazel a little emotional under a full moon or
the spell of an orchestra,--Hazel matter of fact and managerial,
giving decided opinions on any subject, ancient or modern,--Hazel
as a peppy little tongue-lasher or a gracious social
partner,--any and all of these moods were familiar to him. But
not this sobbing reaction to a vital experience, nor the
anguished tears. It made of her a girl he had never known. She
seemed closer to him, tender, more human. He loved her for
it.</p>
<p>The two boats navigated the rushing stream back,--in one Neal
who had handled oars ever since he could remember, and in the
other the cross-eyed Nils Jensen who had spent his boyhood years
on the bottoms of the Missouri. It was well for them that they
had been water-bugs or they might have been swamped more than
once where the ugly water poured heavily around a submerged
building or a clump of trees.</p>
<p>As they were coming into the land where people were waiting
with blankets and coffee, Hazel said: "Neal, there's one thing I
wish you'd promise me,--that if he wants to come, we'll hire this
Nils Jensen."</p>
<p><i>"We'll</i> . . . ?" He grinned. "You mean as a law
partner?"</p>
<p>And now, life given back to her, Hazel was her old self.</p>
<p>"No,--Muscle-neck,--on our farm."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c41" id="c41">CHAPTER XLI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the early summer Neal took Hazel to his home to meet his
people and to see the place where she was to live. She saw the
long graveled driveway, the wide sweep of yard under the big
trees, the solid old house which Fritz and Emil had built so many
years before and which had been modernized with sun-room and
furnace and lights in Myrtie's time, and felt a distinct surprise
at the lovely old place set so far back from the paved
highway.</p>
<p>"In England they'd call it an ancestral home," she admitted
when they were circling up the driveway.</p>
<p>A rabbit, bounding across the grass at that moment, Neal said
in his light way to cover the emotion he felt: "Ah, the hare!
Higgins,--the hounds. We ride at once."</p>
<p>She met Neal's father and mother, warming immediately to his
father with his natural dignity and quiet manner. She was not so
sure about the mother,--a fluttery little woman whose
conversation ran largely to speaking of things she wished she
could have or do. She was glad the two were to live over in the
small house beyond the lilac hedge.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon Neal took her over to the cottage to
meet his great-grandmother.</p>
<p>Hand in hand they sauntered down the old path which led
through the bluegrass and the white clover, thick and luxurious
again since the great rains.</p>
<p>Neal was a little perturbed as they approached the old house.
He wanted in some way to prepare Hazel,--to explain old Amalia to
this girl he loved, wished boyishly that he knew how to put her
in the best light to this lovely, modern Hazel whose own
grandmother had been so different.</p>
<p>"Hazel, you know Grannie is awfully
old--eighty-something--I've even lost track of her exact age," he
began diffidently. "I guess she's pretty funny looking to
strangers,--sort of weather-beaten and toothless and wrinkled as
an old walnut. But gosh, she's been awfully good to me . . . you
know, cookies in jars, and kiss the bumps and taking care of me
when Mother was nervous or away. My dad feels the same way about
her. I suppose I can't ever see her the way she must seem to
others."</p>
<p>Hazel slipped her arm through Neal's in a sudden tender
gesture. For the first time she thought of him as a little boy,
felt for a moment much, much older than he. It is eternal
Motherhood forever compassionate toward eternal boyhood. "I'll
like her, Neal."</p>
<p>To the boy it brought a swift renewed rush of love for
her,--he could not have told why. It made him stop in the
pathway, suddenly kiss her forehead and her cheek tenderly,--not
the kiss of passionate young manhood but a tribute to her
friendship and sympathy,--engendered at that moment by a feeling
which would be deeper and more lasting than the other.</p>
<p>They went on up the curving path between the petunias toward
the little house in which old Amalia had lived for so many
years.</p>
<p>They passed the sloping cellar door with the stone crocks in a
row, the clump of gooseberries over which the dish-towels dried,
and the thick bushes on each side of the steps with their fat
cabbage-roses in blossom now.</p>
<p>Old Amalia was just inside the screen door in the sitting-room
in which there was all the accumulation of the years,--old blue
plates on a shelf and gilded milkweed pods, a little mirror with
blue brush and comb in a tin tray underneath, the sale carpet
with its scroll figures tacked tautly over thick oat straw.</p>
<p>Hazel had a feeling that the whole thing was a stage setting
or a movie scene,--on the wall the <i>Guten Morgen</i> and
<i>Gute Nacht</i> pictures of the chunky half-nude child with the
daisies on her head, the couch with its bright pieced quilt
cover, the oval walnut stand on which there were the Bible and
some star fish and a blue plush album. There were odors, too,
peculiarly fitting to the place,--old clean odors,--soap-suds and
mothballs and cinnamon. Whether the latter came from the roses
beside the door or the kitchen beyond, she could not tell.</p>
<p>Old Amalia was patching, putting a neat little square in the
corner of a table-cloth with small, even stitches. Hazel saw that
Neal had described her quite definitely. Her hair, plastered down
tightly over the pink spots of her head, was wound in a little
hard knob at the nape of her neck. In the big chair she looked as
tiny and wrinkled as a little brown gnome.</p>
<p>As the screen door opened she looked at the young people from
pale old eyes that had to adjust themselves slowly to the new
focus.</p>
<p>"Hello, Grandma. Do you know me to-day?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It's Joey," she said with apparent delight at her
quickness.</p>
<p>"No . . . guess again. It's Neal . . ."</p>
<p>"Tsk . . . tsk . . . Neal! So big a boy you're gettin' to
be."</p>
<p>"No . . . you're fooling, Grannie. I'm only six-feet-one, and
one hundred and ninety is all that I weigh."</p>
<p>"And who iss dis?" Old Amalia wanted to know.</p>
<p>"Now this," said Neal, and he slipped an arm around Hazel, and
drew her forward, ". . . this needs explaining. <i>This</i> . . .
is Hazel."</p>
<p>"Hachel?"</p>
<p>"Yes . . . like the other nuts, you know." He grinned, but
when he saw old Amalia was not appreciating his little joke, he
explained: "She's <i>my girl,</i> Grannie. You know I told you
about her. We're going to be married."</p>
<p>Old Amalia put out a brown little hand as shrunken as a
mummy's. "Excoose me," she said to Hazel with a toothless smile.
"Alvays I forget." She spoke apologetically. "Of de long ago I
remember . . . but of only yesterday already I forget."</p>
<p>Hazel felt a sudden tenderness toward the little, brown doll
of a woman, so shy and so gentle in her broken speech. "Neal has
told me about you."</p>
<p>"Neal iss a goot boy. You vill be a goot vife, I hope?" she
questioned.</p>
<p>"I hope I'll be."</p>
<p>Old Amalia scanned her closely. "You vill be," she nodded. "A
<i>schön . . .</i> nice face you have. And your name it is
Hachel?"</p>
<p>Neal answered for her. "Yes, Grannie. Hazel Meier,--but not
for long."</p>
<p>"Meier?" old Amalia repeated.</p>
<p>"Hazel Meier," he said it louder and more plainly. "Her
father, Carter Meier, was a banker at Cedar City. And the old
gentleman, Matthias Meier, was Hazel's grandfather."</p>
<p><i>"Matthias Meier?"</i> Amalia was confused,--was grasping
for something,--some queer puzzle which she could not piece
together. "Has he come, too? To Nebraska City has he come?"</p>
<p>"He's dead, Grandma. Why, you wanted to go to the services for
him yourself. Don't you remember? When we read it in the paper?
You wanted to go but Dad thought it was too hot and too far."</p>
<p>"Yes . . . I remember. Alvays I am forgetting . . . and
remembering."</p>
<p>"What, Grandma?" Hazel asked. "What are you remembering?"</p>
<p>"Just that . . . <i>immer . . .</i> alvays . . . spring . . .
comes on . . ."</p>
<p>"That's like a poem I know:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"'One thing, I remember:<br>
Spring came on forever,<br>
Spring came on forever,'<br>
Said the Chinese nightingale."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>"It is so." Old Amalia nodded as though she knew all things,
as though her life had embraced all wisdom.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it makes you remember when you were young."</p>
<p><i>"Vielleicht . . .</i> perhaps . . . it does."</p>
<p>But Neal was impatient now.</p>
<p>"Well, how do you like her, Grannie?"</p>
<p>The old woman's eyes still peered up at Hazel's. She reached
out a tiny brown hand and stroked the firm white one of the girl.
<i>"Kleine Taube,"</i> she murmured.</p>
<p>"Talk United States, Grandma. What's that?"</p>
<p>"Little dove."</p>
<p>"Little dove . . . my eye! Snapping-turtle you mean."</p>
<p>"Hachel Meier," the old woman nodded as though she understood
a very wise and very ancient thing. "So it vill be."</p>
<p>"Can't you get up a little more enthusiasm, Grandma? Say
something a little more exciting and strong. You surely like
her."</p>
<p>"In German I say it, to her, Neal. <i>'Ich liebe
dich.'"</i></p>
<p>"That's better. Well, we'll go now, Hazel,--now that Grannie
has leeby-dicked you."</p>
<p>They said good-by to the old lady sitting there in her big
rocking-chair like a little brown Buddha, and went happily down
the path between the fat cabbage roses and the petunias.</p>
<p>Amalia watched them go,--tall, strong, young. For a time she
sat there quietly, saying something over to herself as one learns
a lesson by rote.</p>
<p>She must think this thing out very carefully and be sure she
had it right. She knew she was apt to imagine things that were
not true and forget those that were real. It was very hard to
know always which ones had happened and which were but
dreams.</p>
<p>This was different. This must never get mixed with the
fancies. It belonged here and now among the things that were
true. She must not allow it to slip away from her into the
shadows,--must hold it as steadily in her mind as she was holding
to the chair.</p>
<p>There was something she wanted to do,--something she would do
at once while she remembered.</p>
<p>She pulled herself out of her rocker and picking her way
carefully from table to chair, went into her bedroom. All the
time she held steadily to this queer new thing so that she would
not forget any part of it. Sometimes that happened,
too,--recalling only a portion of a thing, so that the
half-memories worried and distressed her. But this one was still
wholly clear.</p>
<p>She opened the bottom drawer of her dresser and removed an
unwieldly-looking bundle wrapped in very old muslin, yellowed and
worn. This she unwound layer by layer until she had uncovered a
long box. It was ornamented with sea shells, angel-wings and moon
shells, Roman snails and other fragile, fan-like shells of a sea
she had never seen. They were broken and nicked and unglued in
places so that ugly brown patches of the wooden frame showed
through. Almost were they symbolic of things that had never
been,--journeys to far-off seas, hearing the sound of wind in
whipping sails and the call of the gulls on the sand.</p>
<p>With hands that trembled with their eighty-six years, she
lifted a tray and took out two quilt blocks. Strangely enough in
the dark of its shelter, the pink had not faded,--only the white
was yellowed. A needle in one of the blocks was brown with rust
so that it crumbled to the touch. This she removed and replaced
with a bright one from the cushion on her bureau. Then from the
box she took a darkly tarnished thimble and fitted it to her tiny
finger.</p>
<p>Still holding carefully to the thought in her mind as one
might hold lovely fragile china lest it drop, she made her way
cautiously back to her rocker and sat down to finish the <i>Baum
des Lebens</i>--Tree of Life--quilt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c42" id="c42">CHAPTER XLII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Neal and Hazel were married in August with the wheat harvested
and the corn maturing for its October husking,--a simple wedding
in the rented apartment of the Meiers.</p>
<p>Joe and Myrtie with old Amalia drove down to Lincoln in the
big car,--Neal in his own roadster. Myrtie had not been any too
gracious about taking Grandma, but when Joe said definitely:
"Grandma is going if she is able to take the long ride," Myrtie
made no further excuses, but merely went about with a martyred
air of having more responsibility on her shoulders than any human
could quite bear.</p>
<p>She had a new outfit, too, one of the first of the fall suits
with a matching hat of beige and her fox furs: "for no telling
what elaborate sort of thing Mrs. Meier will wear" she had said
to Joe. So she was somewhat astounded now to be met at the door
by Hazel's mother in a simple printed silk.</p>
<p>There were only a few present at the ceremony, three of
Hazel's sorority sisters, an old family friend, two of Neal's
fraternity brothers, the minister and his wife, Carter and
Lucile, Joe and Myrtie, and old Grandma Holmsdorfer who
stubbornly would not change her name to Holms.</p>
<p>Carter Meier, looking at Hazel in the traveling dress in which
she was to be married, wondered how she felt about this simple
affair, whether she was missing the pomp of a big church wedding
such as her mother had,--as she might have had if things were
different. If she were doing so, she was game about it, giving no
intimation of her thoughts.</p>
<p>They were all there now, and some one was whispering that it
was time. Neal and Hazel were walking over to the mantel with its
garden flowers as informally as though they were playing charades
and the members of the little group were to guess what they were
portraying. The minister took his place. No ushers, no
pipe-organ, no "Promise Me," no bridal-veil,--not a hot-house
flower, excepting the bridal bouquet. Hazel, in her soft brown
going-away suit with egg-shell blouse, golden-yellow roses in her
arms,--Neal, well-tailored, a fine-looking, upstanding figure of
a chap with keen, honest eyes. University graduates. And there
were people in the world who thought all farmers were bewhiskered
gents forever chewing on a succession of straws, and their wives
drab creatures always standing forlornly at the doorways of
shanties.</p>
<p>The minister was speaking: "Dearly beloved . . ." his voice a
mere accompaniment to Carter Meier's thoughts. His little girl
was being married. What a short while ago they had watched her
first baby step,--she had made one little tottering forward
movement, and overcome by her own accomplishment let forth a
jubilant crow of delight that lost her the equilibrium she had so
recently gained.</p>
<p>And now something was getting in Carter Meier's way so he
could not see the bride at all: a little girl skipping up and
down the lawn of the Cedar City house in the early morning, arms
outstretched like a bird's wings,--on a single roller-skate
propelling herself wildly up and down the sidewalk,--riding her
Shetland pony around the streets, her dark red mop of curls
blowing in the wind . . . his active, happy little daughter! What
would her life be? Hard? He would save her from all the blows it
would deal her, if he only could,--from all the hard work of it,
if it were possible. But who knew, at that, she might be happier
than young women to whom work was a foreign thing. In what
direction lay happiness anyway?</p>
<p>Joe Holms was thinking: "That's my boy taking the big step.
You won't make mistakes all the time, Neal . . . you're different
. . . you'll always be different . . ."</p>
<p>Lucile was thinking: "I mustn't cry . . . if I start I
couldn't stop. I left my mother without thinking much about it. I
must look straight at Hazel and smile so that when she looks at
me she can see how happy I am. I <i>am</i> happy . . . I <i>am. .
. .</i> Oh, no, I'm not, I'm miserable and I want to be young
again and have my little girl back."</p>
<p>Myrtie was thinking: "He won't care for me any more. He'll
take her places and bring gifts to her and give her all the
attention."</p>
<p>Old Amalia Holmsdorfer was not thinking about either Hazel or
Neal. She was peering with pale watery eyes across the room at
Carter Meier, her thoughts in queer confusion: "So that's your
boy, Matthias. He isn't as tall as you, and of course he's gray,
and you're not. But he holds his shoulders like you, and you
would have looked like that if you had lived to be over
twenty-one."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c43" id="c43">CHAPTER XLIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>There are those who would call it the end of the story when
Hazel Meier married Neal Holms. To say the story is finished is
not true, for no mere story can ever be complete, no family
history contain a beginning or an end. One may only cut out a bit
from life, trimming away all that went before and all that will
come after.</p>
<p>It was early September when Hazel returned from her
Wedding-trip with Neal and went to live in the old house set in
the elms and the maples far back from the paved highway.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, then, she was beginning her married life on
the same land where old Amalia had homesteaded so many years
before but with two great differences--all the wonderful modern
surroundings in contrast to the primitive ones of the pioneer
days,--and the fact that where Hazel carried the flame of love
burning deep in her heart for her young husband, Amalia had known
only gray ashes.</p>
<p>Peculiarly, in spite of the difference in the generations,
Hazel approached her task much as the young Amalia had once done,
vigorously and with responsibility. With her resourcefulness and
her power of accomplishment she put her young shoulder to the
wheel, mapping out her day's work just as she had planned her
University schedule. She allowed no waste about her. Nothing was
thrown away. Every potato peeling had its use, every bone its
nutritive value. "So don't try to get up any debate with
<i>me,"</i> she would laugh, "that higher education unfits woman
for the home."</p>
<p>It was characteristic of her that one of the first things she
did was to ask Neal's parents if the half-hearted pink stucco
could be pulled off the honest old gray stones underneath.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't care what you do, Hazel," Myrtie said with
tired resignation. "There's so little money to do anything with.
I wonder how you have the heart to plan a single change."</p>
<p>Joe and Myrtie were living in the small house with Grandma.
But on a morning of that September Myrtie came over, stepping
daintily through the bluegrass.</p>
<p>Hazel, finishing the last of her dishes, said: "Come on in the
living-room, Mother Holms, where you will be more comfortable."
Every one always saw to it that Neal's mother was
comfortable.</p>
<p>She washed her hands, followed Myrtie into the living-room
where she picked up the braided rug she was making. It was apple
green and egg-shell. "How do you like it?" she asked. "I'm using
all the old green drapes that were worn out. Grandma showed me
how and I'm perfectly fascinated with it. I think it tickled her
pink to show me. Isn't it funny--this returning to all the old
ways? Ever since I knit my dress I'm crazy about the old
hand-craft. I've even gone so far as to think I'd like a loom set
up in the vacant bedroom. Maybe I'll weave Neal's clothes yet."
And she laughed gaily.</p>
<p>Myrtie did not laugh. "I don't see how you can do such homely
things cheerfully, Hazel. Well . . ." she broke off abruptly, "I
came over to see you about something rather important. Hazel, you
know me well enough by this time to realize that I never beat
around bushes. I go straight to the point with sincerity and
honesty. You know that, don't you, Hazel?"</p>
<p>"Why . . . yes . . . Mother Holms." She was not sure whether
it was complimentary to agree or otherwise.</p>
<p>"Hazel . . . my life has been very difficult." Myrtie pressed
her little white hands together, as though she must keep herself
well under control before this inexperienced girl. Hazel watched
their delicate softness, the narrow gold circlet and the flashing
of the big diamond solitaire. As always they fascinated her in
their fluttering. Katharine Cornell hands they were, she told
herself,--they ran the gamut of all her emotions.</p>
<p>"What I have been through . . . no one of your youth, of
course, can realize. Childbirth . . . loss of property . . .
disappointments . . . nervousness. Oh, well," she sighed, "we
won't go into all that. It would only worry you and needlessly
torture myself. When one gets cornered in life--in a trap as it
were--all one's ambitions frustrated . . . life all inhibitions .
. ."</p>
<p>Hazel could have laughed aloud if this had not been Neal's
mother. How little like her he was. She was really very sweet and
attractive, too, excepting when she mourned and whined.</p>
<p>"But what can one do . . . or say?" Tears came to Myrtie's
eyes, but she threw Hazel a brave little smile. "My husband
doesn't understand a woman's aspirations . . . her scope of
mental vision . . . her emotional reactions. With all your youth
and inexperience, Hazel, you are a woman . . . and you can
understand . . . this constant beating of your wings against life
. . ."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know, Mother Holms." Hazel had a swift memory of
black water rushing, of bodies hurled into gray space, of the
whirling and dipping of wet, rotten shingles. "I guess I'm just
too fond of life as it is to do much beating."</p>
<p>"All my life, Hazel, I've been doing things for people . . .
and now . . . that I'm in my middle forties . . ."</p>
<p>"Well, life begins at . . ."</p>
<p>"Hazel," Myrtie leaned forward. There were tears on her
lashes. "You spoke just now of the vacant bedroom. What I came to
see you about is this: Will you take Grandma back here to live
with you?"</p>
<p>"You mean for all the time?" It did not seem right. She and
Neal were so young . . . so filled with life and energy. Grandma
was so old . . . so very old and childish.</p>
<p>"Yes . . . if you will, Hazel, without Neal or his father
knowing anything about my speaking to you. Men can misunderstand
motives so easily." Her sensitive lip quivered. "I have spoken to
Grandma about it . . . sounding her out before I said anything to
you."</p>
<p>"What did Grandma say?"</p>
<p>"She said in her broken dialect: 'When you're as old as I am,
Myrtie, it won't make much difference what happens.' So you
see,--it's immaterial to her."</p>
<p>All noontime and for several hours later Hazel thought about
this new thing, how cleverly Neal's mother was manipulating it,
pondered on a half-dozen other times in which she had seemed to
attain her ends. Sweet, pleasant, babyish,--how she must have
wound Neal's father around her finger all these years. Now she
was manipulating this about Grandma as sweetly, as adroitly. "And
when Grandma dies before long," thought Hazel, "it will be Mother
Holms we all must comfort."</p>
<p>By afternoon Hazel was ready to give her answer. The little
Grandmother was not to be hurt or made uncomfortable by it, that
was sure. So she went down through the grassy path to the small
house. "Wouldn't you like to move over to the big house with us
for awhile, Grannie?"</p>
<p>Old Amalia looked up, her faded blue eyes filling. "It's not
so goot, Hachel, to live too long."</p>
<p><i>"You</i> haven't lived too long, Grannie. Neal and I want
you to come. We've been asking Mother Holms for you. We don't
like the vacant bedroom shut up. It just needs a little old
German grandma and all her things in there to make it look
home-like."</p>
<p>The old woman nodded. "I see. To old German grandmas second
sight sometimes Gott gives. You're a goot girl, Hachel."</p>
<p>So old Amalia, always shuttled back and forth, went again to
the stone house,--a little old lady who had lived too long,
clinging to the flotsam left by the tides of life,--old quilts
and scrap-books, albums and tintypes, and a work-box from which
the shells were broken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is one other thing you will want to know,--did Hazel
ever discover that the old grandmother over whom she watched for
the short time remaining was the girl of her grandfather's youth?
And the answer is yes, she and Neal found it out. Else how could
they have pieced together the broken fragments of this story and
the strange crossing of paths by their two families?</p>
<p>A certain morning dawned with velvet-pink and lace-lavender
and satin-yellow lights in the eastern sky, like so many gay
bridesmaids stretching gauzy ribbons for the sun down the aisle
of the world. Hazel had been up in time to see this bridal
procession of the dawn for there was much work to do.</p>
<p>There was the first feeling of fall in the air. The elms,
tawny as lions, lazily dropped a leaf or two. The maples held
high their ruby-crowned heads. Over by the creek-bed
scarlet-flamed sumac shouldered the silver-green of the willows,
and orange-colored bittersweet crept through the tangle of wild
plums. Winter wheat was faintly green against the brown of newly
plowed earth and the tan of the cornfields. Over all was that
haze which clings to the midwest landscape in the autumn,--the
soft blue far-away haze which dissipates as one rides into it. It
seems always to lie softly over the low rolling hills and the
valleys in the fall of the year, this faint ghostly smoke from
the Indian camp-fires of long ago.</p>
<p>Hazel, on her way out to the mailbox at the roadside, stopped
to look at the picture which lay before her,--the low rolling
hills swelled and dipped, black with newly turned earth from the
fall plowing, tawny brown with their cornfields, green with the
faint shoots of winter wheat.</p>
<p>There was something about the new crispness of the air that
was energy-creating. She felt a capacity for turning off work
this morning that made her think of a dozen tasks she wanted to
do,--clean house, bake, sew. However did some people enjoy being
idle? She placed her letters in the box and returned to the
house, regretting the fact that she could not stay out here in
the open in the crisp early fall air.</p>
<p>Mother Holms was out on the porch of the other house sitting
in the morning sun, a knitted lavender jacket around her
shoulders. Hazel waved to her and called out some little foolish
greeting. At that moment she passed the iron kettle hanging on
its two chains and stopped abruptly. Why not try her hand at
soap? She had promised herself to experiment with it sometime and
what better day than the present one which was so enticing in its
call to the out-of-doors?</p>
<p>In anticipation of tackling the job before her, she went into
the house and put on an old green turtle-necked sweater, a short
brown skirt, and a brown beret which with feminine concern she
arranged over her dark red hair as jauntily as though she were to
be in the pep chorus on the bleachers. Then she was back in the
yard bending over the old iron soap-kettle hanging tipsily on two
of its three chains with dirt spilling out from its slanting
side, unloosing the snaps, and scraping out the hard clods.</p>
<p>Grandma came to the dining-room door and peered out under a
gnarled hand,--old Amalia, short and shrunken and toothless, her
little knot of colorless hair twisted as hard as a walnut.</p>
<p>"What be doin', Hachel?" she called in her high, cracked
voice.</p>
<p>"I'm going to make soap, Grandma," Hazel said loudly, and when
first the old woman did not understand, repeated it
patiently.</p>
<p>"Soap?" old Amalia called back tremulously. "Iss spring
comin'?"</p>
<p>"No, Grandma, it's fall."</p>
<p>The old woman came out on the porch then, stepping cautiously,
taking careful hold of the pillar to assist herself. For a few
moments she stood blinking, adjusting her old eyes to the
brightness of the day, the pools of light on the meadow, and the
hills beyond. Then her face became all wrinkled eagerness. "I
smell spring," she said in her high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>"Do you, Grandma?"</p>
<p>Old Amalia standing there with her head thrown back looked at
that moment like a painting by an old master,--as though the girl
in Breton's <i>Song of The Lark</i> had grown wrinkled and feeble
after eighty-six years of listening.</p>
<p>"Iss meadow-larks singin'?" she quavered.</p>
<p>"No, Grandma. It's too late for meadow-larks."</p>
<p>Old Amalia cupped her ear with knotted, trembling fingers,
then broke into a toothless smile. "I <i>hear</i> meadow-larks
singin'."</p>
<p>"Oh, all right, have it your own way," Hazel said to herself.
But she knew that old Amalia was hearing only the songs of
long-silenced meadow-larks.</p>
<p>At that moment Neal came bounding up from the lower lots,
chasing a hog that had worked its grunting way through a broken
fence. The young man's strong legs, encased in their puttees,
covered the ground with such twinkling speed that Hazel's
laughter rang out. "Still after the pig-skin?" she called
gaily.</p>
<p>Neal tossed her a grin over his shoulder and shouted back:
"Score at the end of the hind quarter is nothing to nothing in
favor of the pig." And they both laughed at the foolishness,
young untroubled laughter.</p>
<p>"What's he say?" Amalia quavered.</p>
<p>"He says he'll get it all right," Hazel called up to the old
woman. It took so little to make her cheerful, such small effort
to bring childish joy to her.</p>
<p>The hard clods with their decayed flower roots loosened from
the kettle's sides now, Hazel went into the kitchen, emerging in
a moment with hot water and a short mop-stick. As she passed
Grandma, the old woman piped: "No soap iss made here for many's
de long year."</p>
<p>Hazel, who was saying to herself: "I can believe <i>that,"</i>
smiled back at Grandma when she questioned: "Hachel, iss you
knowin' the soap-kettle come across country from Illinois wid
me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know."</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, she knew nothing about it, for it was the
first time the old kettle had ever been mentioned since her
marriage, but the answer would keep Grandma from prattling on
indefinitely. In that hope Hazel was mistaken, however, for old
Amalia was not to be squelched with such ease. "Dere's more about
de kettle dan you know," she called childishly, nodding her
head.</p>
<p>Unheeding, Hazel went on with her preparations. Never having
made any soap in her life she went into the venture with gay
energy.</p>
<p>And so there was to be soap again in old Amalia's kettle that
so many years before had rocked tipsily on its rounded bottom in
the covered wagon crossing the creek-beds and the hummocky
prairie lands. But how could Hazel know this about the old iron
kettle? How could she comprehend the fact that in its varied uses
. . . soap . . . hog mash . . . geraniums . . . and soap again .
. . it had gone through the whole cycle of the changing economic
problems of the midwest? And how could she understand that the
fate of both,--the humans in two families and the ugly inanimate
black thing at her feet,--had been so inextricably bound together
for several generations? That the story, perforce, of the old
iron kettle was the story of the people themselves?</p>
<p>So she only scrubbed away at the blackness of the old thing
with its dangling chain, knowing that she could make good use of
the grease from past butcherings. And old Amalia stood on the
porch shading her watery eyes from the hazy fall sunshine, and
because she was confused in her mind, kept calling out odd,
inconsequential things.</p>
<p>Neal, having performed the difficult task of getting his
animated pig-skin across the goal line of the hog-lot, came
around the corner of the house then, a hammer in his hand from
the task of mending the fence.</p>
<p>A little hammer began to tap in Hazel's heart, too,--a happy
little trip-hammer as she watched him come up the path in the
morning sunshine. She and Neal, together . . . night and day . .
. day and night! A bridal procession across the sky in the
morning dawn,--and a bridal procession in Hazel's heart!</p>
<p>"What're you doing, Red-top?" He came up to the scene of
activities.</p>
<p>"Making soap, Pig-chaser."</p>
<p>"Well, s'ope springs eternal in the human breast," was his
cheerful rejoinder.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, old Amalia, who lately could never recall
a thing that occurred the day before, but who would clutch at and
grasp the happenings of long ago, like small bits of floatage
from the past, said loudly: "Matthias Meier! Matthias Meier was
his name."</p>
<p>Hazel raised her head. "What was that you said, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"Matthias Meier. My kettle for me in Illinois he made." And
now Amalia was not old and toothless and wrinkled but young and
pink-cheeked with hair the color of cornsilk before the summer
sun has seared it. "Come here, Hachel. You want I should tell you
somet'ing? Sunday afternoons I slip out and by de soap-kettle in
de voods I meet him." She chuckled slyly. "Vile my fader
sleeps."</p>
<p>Hazel, standing motionless, stared at the ancient woman.
"Neal," she said in so queer a tone of voice that startled, he,
too, turned and gazed questioningly at the old woman. "Do you
hear what she's saying?"</p>
<p>"Yes . . . but don't pay any attention . . . she's like that a
lot lately."</p>
<p>"Neal . . . my grandfather came from Illinois. He worked there
in a foundry. He made kettles. And he told me once . . ." her
voice was low, tense, every statement crisp with fact, ". . .
that he came west because of a broken romance . . . that his
first sweetheart married some one else. He said that she was a
beautiful girl . . ." she finished in a whisper, ". . . named
<i>Amalia."</i></p>
<p>She reached out her hand gropingly to Neal so that he took it
quickly. Without moving, the two stared across at the little old
woman, brown as a mummy, clutching the porch pillar and shading
her eyes with a bird-claw hand.</p>
<p>Then, although Neal had not the slightest idea what his young
wife meant when she said brokenly: "It is better to remember our
love as it was in the springtime," he saw the mist of tears in
her eyes,--something vaguely sad, too, and infinitely tender in
her sensitive face,--so that he slipped his arm about her and
drew her close, as though by so doing he could forever keep Love
from growing old and shrunken and bleary-eyed.</p>
<p>For a time they were all poised there motionless in one of
those unusual moments when ordinary life is brushed by the wings
of drama,--the young lovers, an old, old woman and a rusted iron
kettle whose history was the history of them all.</p>
<p>But already old Amalia was moving and speaking,--already she
had forgotten that which so recently she had remembered.</p>
<p>"Meadow-larks iss singin'," she called out in her high cracked
voice, "and I smell spring."</p>
