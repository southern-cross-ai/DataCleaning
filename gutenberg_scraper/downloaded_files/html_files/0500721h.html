<p>When David was eighteen he heard from some of the Outpost
fishermen that his great-uncle Uriah, the rich king of Rockbound,
wanted a fisherman. Here was his opportunity; for weeks, in fact,
ever since old Gershom Born had talked with him, he had wondered
how he would get up courage to face the old man and tell him what
he knew. In his yellow dory he set out from Big Outpost one
morning of early summer. The sea was apparently oil-smooth, but a
ground swell always runs among these outer islands, and the flood
tide was against him. He tugged hard at the splintered spruce
oars, which had seen two years service on the Grand Banks,
lifting his elbows at the finish of his stroke in a manner
peculiar to the Outposters. With slack water he gave himself a
spell and drifted idly for a little, a yellow speck on an immense
floor of blue.</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky half-conscious of his insignificance
in the universe above him; then, feeling cold water about his
feet, reflected that only a half inch of leaky spruce marked him
off from the watery world below, where shadowy albercore dodged
in and out between streamers of waving kelp. The Outposts and
Rockbound, now almost equidistant, were dimmed and softened by
summer mists. As he sat there resting, his oars half drawn in
through the thole pins, he looked at first glance like a hundred
other young fishermen along the coast. He was barefoot and clad
only in a pair of ragged brown trousers and a faded blue
buttonless shirt that fell open at the neck to reveal a bronzed
and hairy chest. His hands that clutched the oars were calloused
and split, and scarred with marks of salt-water boils and burns
from running hand line or halliard. Sly but kind gray eyes shone
out through narrow slits overhung with thick eyebrows; a hawk's
nose gave his face a touch of fierceness; his head was crowned
with a thick brown mop of uncombed hair. He was not unhandsome,
and when he smiled the corners of his mouth twitched and
drooped.</p>
<p>Though he looked it not, he was a man of destiny--in small
things, it is true, yet in relation to the universe all things
upon this earth are small--and this voyage in his yellow dory, a
voyage of destiny, less spectacular than Jason's but requiring
none the less courage and resolution. For Jason had with him
forty heroes and had but to meet a dragon, while David was alone
and had to meet Uriah. As he floated idly there and looked up at
the pale smoky sky and across the shining turquoise floor, he was
conscious of the throb of the great deep below him and felt
himself in the grip of Destiny of "some strange consequence yet
hanging in the stars" that he could not understand. Why not let
Fate decide for him whether he should row on to Rockbound or
return to the Outposts? he thought. He was a Jung himself, but a
poor Jung, a gearless, homeless Jung; how dare he face and make
demands of Uriah, the rich king of Rockbound, who had wealth in
boats and land, and lofts piled high with herring nets and tubs
of trawl? He was on a line between a clump of lofty spruces on
the Metatogan Main and Lubeck Island Light. Let Fate decide! He
pulled in his oars, let them rest from gunwale to gunwale, and
for fifteen minutes watched his landmarks. The beginning of the
ebb and a faint draught of offshore wind were setting him toward
Rockbound. Fate had decided! Out went his oars, and he gave
way.</p>
<p>When his stem bumped against the logs of Uriah's launch he
sprang out and drew his dory up a little--he dared not draw her
too far without invitation--and made fast the painter to a spike.
The ebb was running fast now, and she would be high and dry in
half an hour. Heart in his throat, his bare feet took the long
strides from log to log, and he reached the door of the great
fish house just as Uriah, a terrifying figure, waddled out, his
yellow oilskins spotted with blood and glistening with sequins of
herring scales.</p>
<p>"An' what might ye be wantin'?" said the old man, the king of
Rockbound.</p>
<p>"I wants fur to be yur sharesman," answered David.</p>
<p>"Us works here on Rockbound."</p>
<p>"I knows how to work."</p>
<p>"Knows how to work an' brung up on de Outposts!" jeered Uriah.
"Us has half a day's work done 'fore de Outposters rub de sleep
out o' dere eyes, ain't it!"</p>
<p>"I knows how to work," repeated the boy stubbornly.</p>
<p>"Where's yur gear an' clothes at?"</p>
<p>"I'se got all my gear an' clothes on me," said David, grinning
down at his buttonless shirt, ragged trousers, and bare, horny
feet, "but I owns yon dory: I salvaged her from de sea an' beat
de man what tried to steal her from me."</p>
<p>Uriah's eyes showed a glint of interest.</p>
<p>"You ain't got no place for to live on dis island; no one
won't take in a tramp like you."</p>
<p>"Yes I is."</p>
<p>"How's dat?"</p>
<p>"I owns one tent' o' dis island t'rough my grandfader old
Edward Jung, same as you owns yur shares."</p>
<p>The boy stood trembling inwardly and with shaking knees, yet
looking the old tyrant boldly in the eyes.</p>
<p>"Who's bin stuffin' ye wid dat foolishness?"</p>
<p>"It ain't no foolishness, it's true. Old Gershom Born, de
keeper o' Barren Island Light an' de wisest man in all dese
islands, tole me las' time he was on de Outposts; an' says he, if
yur great-uncle Ury refuse ye, go before lawyer Kingsford in
Liscomb an' claim yur right. Yes, he did."</p>
<p>Uriah grunted and glowered. Old Gershom Born's name was one to
be conjured with. He read fat law books and wrote deed, will, and
mortgage for the islanders as fair as the grandest lawyer.
Moreover, the king knew in his heart that the boy was right.</p>
<p>"What ye do wid land?" Uriah had been growing tall timothy and
fat cabbages on David's piece for ten years free of charge and
was loath to give it up.</p>
<p>"Live on it, farm it same as youse do. Dat house where Mudder
died's mine too," said David, grown bolder, and he pointed to a
tumbledown cottage which Uriah used as a storeroom for lobster
pots.</p>
<p>The king looked scornfully at the landless serf; David stood
in the presence of Goliath.</p>
<p>"I'se got de same rights as Anapest an' de Krauses." Like many
kingdoms, Uriah's was not whole and perfect, but troubled by
invaders.</p>
<p>"Maybe you is got some rights, maybe you isn't, but ye can't
be no sharesman wid me."</p>
<p>"Den I'll squat on my land an' live in my house and fish
offshore in my dory." David had gone over all the possibilities
of this conversation many times before.</p>
<p>"You, wid nair a line or net to git bait."</p>
<p>"I got a line an' I kin pick up squid an' caplin on de
beach."</p>
<p>"An' where will ye land yur boat? Ye can't use my launch."</p>
<p>"I'll land on de sand beach in Sou'west Cove an' haul my dory
out."</p>
<p>"One summer storm will make kindlin' wood o' your dory."</p>
<p>"Den I kin land on de Krauses' launch. Anapest will let me.
Anyhow, yur sharesman or no, I sticks and stays."</p>
<p>The old fox saw he was beaten, and he liked the fight in the
boy: after all, he was a Jung, though a beggarly one.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't take ye for no sharesman, 'cause ye couldn't hold
up yur end wid my boys."</p>
<p>"Give me a mont's trial," said David. "If I can't ketch fish
fur fish an' haul net fur net wid Martin, Casper, Joseph, I'll go
back to de Outposts an' ask fur no wages."</p>
<p>"Done," snapped the crafty Uriah, who saw a chance of keeping
the land and of getting a month's work for nothing. "You take
<i>Ph&oelig;be</i> tomorrow, far boat on de launch; she's stood
idle since we lost Mark. Haul out yur dory on de launch."</p>
<p>Thus was the first battle with the old king won, and thus the
disguised prince set foot upon his own dominion.</p>
<p>David turned from the old man and walked up the pathway to his
mother's house, that was well-nigh a ruin. The doorstep gaped
from the sill, the sagging back door hung by one hinge of
leather, the kitchen was half full of lobster pots, and as these
had been pushed rudely against the walls, plaster and lathing
were broken. Big slabs had fallen from the ceiling. The kitchen
stove was yellow with rust, and the pipe entered the chimney at a
rakish angle. There was no furniture save a long sofa, on which,
he remembered, Richard Covey had slept out many a drunken spree,
and a hand-made chair the old folk had brought from Sanford. To
most people this dilapidated house would have been only a source
of heartbreak; to David, who had nothing, it was a potential
palace. It was his own, his first possession, he should live
there, and his gray eyes twinkled and the corners of his mouth
drooped as familiar objects awakened some half-forgotten childish
memory.</p>
<p>First, two rooms must be cleared for kitchen and bedroom. He
worked his way around to the dining-room door and began lugging
lobster pots into parlour and front hallway. A front door and
reception room would be superfluous to him for many a day. When
kitchen and small room opening off it were freed of pots and
trawl tubs, he descended into the damp cellar, and there, groping
in a jungle of broken fishing gear, found a handleless shovel and
the stub of an old broom. The dark cobwebbed cellar seemed a
source of wealth that he would explore at leisure. Smiling fondly
at his treasure trove, he returned upstairs, and clearing up
plaster and dirt with shovel and broom, threw the débris out into
the yard. From the stove he dug out the matted ashes and found
among them a black twisted fork. More property! His eyes gleamed
again with pleasure in his possession, then darkened as the fork
reminded him that he had nothing to eat and no source of
supplies. He ran down to the shore and returned with an armful of
gray driftwood.</p>
<p>Evening was coming, and, after the work about his house and
the long row from the Outposts, he was hungry. He looked across
the fields toward Anapest's sombre house, where a lamp glowed
yellow in the kitchen window. There was something friendly and
inviting in that blotch of light. Dare he? He must not let Uriah
beat him, and he could not live forever by hitching up his belt.
There was nothing else for it; he must beg bread of someone;
later he would show them he could repay and earn his keep. From
the tribe of the Krauses, who like himself had established a
foothold on Rockbound through Anapest's inheritance of a tenth
share from old Edward, who had died intestate, he had had no sign
of welcome nor even awareness of his existence, though every soul
on Rockbound had known of his arrival ten minutes after he had
landed. Krauses and Jungs were immemorial enemies: they grunted
at one another but seldom spoke, sent their children to spy into
rival fish pens, and lived in a tense atmosphere of envy and
mutual ill-will. Uriah had never forgiven old Edward for dying
without a will, nor Anapest for marrying Joshua Kraus, nor the
Krauses generally for having invaded his kingdom, which, he felt,
would have been perfect and complete without them. As Uriah was
king of all the Rockbound Jungs, so Anapest was empress of the
Krauses. She ruled a smaller kingdom but was none the less
imperious; no fleet of nets was set, nor did any Kraus boat set
off from the Rock without her sanction.</p>
<p>Still, David felt, as he stared at the yellow light, that
there was more hope of obtaining bread from Anapest than from
Uriah. He crossed the fields and knocked humbly at her kitchen
door. Anapest, her thick black dress girt in at the waist with a
man's belt, was bustling about the stove.</p>
<p>"Come in," she called harshly, and David's bare feet scraped
the rough splinters of the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>"I'm yur nephew David Jung from de Outposts."</p>
<p>Anapest looked the vagrant over, her quick dark eyes taking in
torn shirt, frayed trousers, and bare feet. Her heart softened
toward him at once; still, she guessed he had come to be Uriah's
sharesman, and his lot was thrown in with the enemy. Christian,
Nicholas, and Melcher, sons and henchmen, ate greedily at the
kitchen table and did not so much as throw a glance in his
direction.</p>
<p>"How's all de folks on de Outposts?"</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>"What you doin' here?"</p>
<p>"Uriah's sharesman."</p>
<p>"Ury's sharesman. Ha! a lot ye'll have fur yur summer's work
when Joe an' Casper has figured expenses."</p>
<p>"Beginnin' I'se 'll take what dey gives me; some day I'se 'll
take what I wants. I don't expect no mercy, but I'm hungry an' I
come to ask some bread off ye."</p>
<p>"Sit ye down an' fill yur belly. Arter all, yur my brudder's
son, if ye is Ury's sharesman."</p>
<p>David sat down meekly at the kitchen table, for he was even
more fearful of Anapest than Uriah. The Kraus boys looked up and
grunted at him; any stranger was to them a potential enemy, and
this stranger had allied himself with a hostile clan. Anapest was
a grand cook and fed her men well. There was a steaming fish
chowder made from a fresh-caught haddock mixed with onions,
sliced potatoes, and fried pork scraps; there were fried herring
roes and new potatoes in their rosy jackets, showing mealy where
the broken skin turned back; there were high piles of thick white
bread and mugs of hot tea. David made hay while the sun
shone.</p>
<p>"I'se sorry to beg," he said after the edge was taken off his
hunger, "but I'se 'll have to git de scatterin' loaf o' bread off
ye, Aunt Anapest. I'se 'll pay when I gits my first mont's share;
I'se got naught, but ye'll lose naught t'rough me."</p>
<p>"Why don't ye beg yur bread off Ury?" asked Christian
brutally.</p>
<p>"I can't. He's too hard."</p>
<p>"Den, if ye gets no bread ye can't stay on Rockbound,"
remarked Melcher hopefully.</p>
<p>"Yes, I kin! I stays, I sticks, if I has to dig up de roots o'
de field. I kin live on fish an' mussels an' an odd checkerback.
Man, you'se don't know what I bin a-used to livin' on. I stays
an' lives in my mudder's house."</p>
<p>"Dey's haunts dere," said Christian, "what'll twitch de
clothes off ye nights."</p>
<p>"Haunts or no haunts, I stays. I ain't skeered o' no haunts.
Why, on de Outposts I lived next house to de ghost catcher."</p>
<p>"What, Johnny Publicover?"</p>
<p>"Ay, Johnny Publicover, de same what ketched de fierce Sanford
ghost," said David between mouthfuls. He had caught the Krauses'
interest for a moment and must make the most of his chance and
eat enough to keep him alive for the next two or three days. Then
fortune would throw something in his way, he would have fish, at
any rate.</p>
<p>"Ye'll have a hard go wid no bread," said Nicholas.</p>
<p>"And he won't go wid no bread," shouted Anapest, empress of
all the Krauses, stamping her foot. "What ye talkin' so fur, ye
great lumps, to yur own cousin? Has his house an' land done ye
air a good? Isn't Ury gettin' free grass an' cabbages off dat
land fur dese ten years? Bread ye'll have, boy; t'ree big loaves
a week, if ye kin live on dat."</p>
<p>"Dat I kin," said David rising, "an' my t'anks to ye, Aunt
Anapest. Ye'll find me in de years to come no grudgin'
neighbour."</p>
<p>Then, tucking one of Anapest's great loaves under his arm, he
went back to his own house, and in the darkness built up a fire
of driftwood in the rusty stove and sat down before it to plan
and dream. Though he had neither lantern nor candle, the fire
cast a fitful glow on the rough floor and made a glimmer of light
in the room. The summer fog, pushed northward by the inshore
breeze, had enveloped the island and, with its damp blanket,
intensified the darkness of a moonless night. The hateful,
ill-smelling careys, who love such nights, squeaked and gibbered
around the house, and he heard an occasional whir of nighthawks'
wings. The gray driftwood cracked sharp in the stove, and there
was some strange rustling among the lobster pots in the hallway.
But though David knew that the footless nigger of Rockbound was
abroad on such nights, he sat unmoved by the stove and stirred
only to feed the fire with a fresh stick. He was used to
loneliness, and fog had no terror for him. Though he knew it not,
as he sat there reviewing the past, he had great capital wealth
in the fact that nothing to be faced in the future could be worse
than what he had endured in the past. Starting from zero, the
meanest acquired possession would connote a worth out of all
proportion to its intrinsic value.</p>
<p>He could not recall his father, lost at sea when he was but
two years of age. His mother had died of consumption in the
bedroom that opened off the dining room. Certainly her pale ghost
would not haunt him! He remembered going often into her room,
where she had raised a limp hand to stroke his head and look at
him with pity. Her hand, he remembered, was so transparent that
the bones shone through. His stepfather had been a bad one. After
his mother had married Richard Covey, Uriah's loud-mouthed
sharesman, they had had nothing but misfortune. Richard Covey was
a luckless man: he had gone fishing on the wrong days; when the
nets of others were white with meshed herring, his had but a
scattering of fish; sportive albacores slit great rents in his
fleets while the fleets of others were untouched; the seas rolled
his lobster pots into the dog holes, a tangled chaos of broken
lath and twisted head rope. David thought of what he had suffered
under Richard Covey's rough hand: scarce a day had he been free
from welts on his legs and lumps on his head as big as a sea
urchin.</p>
<p>At seven he was taken in the boat and assigned duties beyond
his strength. He was useful to the man, for his sharp young eyes
could pick up net or trawl buoys, white with a stripe of scarlet,
far quicker than the rum-bleared eyes of his stepfather. He had
learned to endure cold, fog, and blows, and to sag on a hand line
to the maximum of his little strength. It was hard work when the
cod ran heavy and they fished with two snoods, for when he hooked
a pair he could not draw them over the gunwale, and this brought
upon him blows and curses. When they sailed, Richard Covey held
the tiller and he crouched as far forward in the eyes as he could
get, a bit of the spare jib drawn over his bare legs. How he had
blessed the sun when it shone warm; the sun had been his best
friend.</p>
<p>He remembered well that awful gray dawn when he crept out to
light the kitchen fire, his duty since the age of five. Richard
Covey lay sprawling on the sofa his legs twisted in a queer
position. He had paid little attention to him at first, but put
rustling paper and kindlings quietly in the stove; he had been
beaten sometimes for waking the man as he laid the fire. Morning
light that sifted through the eastern window fell on Richard
Covey's white face and showed lips that were blue, a mouth half
open, and bleared eyes that seemed to wink. He had been terrified
by the winking eyes: had he made too much noise with the rustling
paper? Then a deeper terror had entered his little soul: there
was no sound of snoring or deep breathing that Richard Covey
usually made. With a courage he himself had never understood, he
had walked over and touched the man's face; it was set and cold.
He had rushed into his mother's room shouting exultingly,</p>
<p>"He's dead, Mamma, he's dead!"</p>
<p>His mother had roused herself listlessly.</p>
<p>"Go tell Uriah and the boys to carry him away," she whispered,
sinking back upon her pillows.</p>
<p>Three weeks later his mother had died. She was to be buried on
Big Outpost, as are all the Rockbounders, and, hardly knowing
what he did, he climbed over the side of the whaler on the launch
as they lifted in his mother's rough board coffin, that looked
like a great fish box. No one said him nay as he clambered
aboard, no one spoke a word of pity. The Jungs had hated and
despised Richard Covey--he was pariah, no one lent him gear or
bait--Uriah had never forgiven the boy's mother for marrying the
man, and as a child he had inherited a share of the hatred.</p>
<p>He could never forget that sail to the Outposts: the wind was
fair, and Uriah winged out the tan-sailed whaler. The rough white
coffin lay on the amidship thwarts by the centreboard; in the
stern sat Uriah at the tiller with his son Mark minding the
sheets, both red-faced, big-nosed--the Jew of the Levys shone out
in Mark--both fierce eyed. He had sat in the bow, a pale-faced,
underfed urchin of eight, staring at the coffin or looking across
the sea. No word was spoken in that four miles of water
journey.</p>
<p>When the shallow grave had been filled in and heaped up in the
Outpost cemetery and the few mourners had filtered away, he had
been left alone. He had sat there a long time, stunned by the
fact that his last feeble friend was gone, but he was dry-eyed,
he could not cry. After a while he had gone down to the Outpost
launch to get in the boat. Far out on the southern waters he had
seen Uriah's tan-sailed whaler beating her way back to Rockbound.
They had left him without a word; he was alone on a strange
island among strange people.</p>
<p>After that, he remembered, he had begged a crust from door to
door and slept in sail lofts, a piece of an old canvas wrapped
about his legs. In the first winter he would certainly have
perished had it not been for the kindness of Jennie Run-over, so
named by some local wit, because her fat hams oozed over the seat
of any chair in which she sat, no matter how capacious, as does
rising dough over the edge of a pan. She sold liquor, was an
unofficial harlot, and kept in her house four stout girls, who in
September were visited by lustful fishermen, home from three
months' durance on the Grand Banks. Jennie Run-over had picked
him up one day as he stood on the beach staring out to Rockbound.
Her heart, he supposed, must have been touched by the sight of
the pale-faced, forsaken, half-starved, homeless mite of a
boy.</p>
<p>At any rate, she took him to her house and taught him to fetch
and carry; he gathered driftwood, cut kindlings, brought water
from the spring, weeded the garden, fed the pigs, and slept on a
pile of shavings in the cellar. But he had enough to eat; for the
first time in his life, all he could eat, every day. True, he was
often beaten by Jennie when she was drunk, but she sometimes
patted his head when she was sober. For five years he had served
Jennie and learned a great deal about drunkenness and lust. As
soon as he was big enough, he had shipped as "boy" on a banking
schooner, and slept well up in the eyes, where every night, his
ear pressed close to the planking, he had heard the lap of waves
against the stem. He remembered many a night when lanterns hung
from the fore boom, the schooner's waist a welter of slippery
cod, and he had stood ready for anything, to sharpen a knife,
fetch a basket of salt, or let go the falls for a homing dory.
"Whar's dat dam' boy?" the salters used to roar from the hold.
"Send him down wid water." "Whar's dat dam' boy?" a splitter
bawled on deck. "I wants my second knife from B bunk in de
fo'c'sle." Up he used to climb from the cool hold to dive into
the smelly forecastle. He was every man's boy to fetch and carry
and many a clip he got on the side of the head. Still, on the
whole they had been kind to him, especially John Brooks, the
coloured man, who looked like a pirate with his big gilt earrings
hanging from pierced ear lobes. He was high-line and feared no
man, and, sometimes, when he was steersman, John would let him do
a trick at the wheel, and teach him how to hold a star on the
rigging and keep the schooner on her course without staring in
the binnacle.</p>
<p>Jennie Run-over had taken all his slender wages for his
winter's board, and he wore cast-off garments that seemed always
too large or too small. For three whole winters he had gone
without boots. He had spoken truly to Uriah: that very day when
he landed on Rockbound his complete worldly possessions were his
shirt, trousers, a frayed cod line, and the dory he had salvaged
and fought for. As he sat by the flickering stove, he felt very
rich in his new possession of house and land. They could not
scare him off by tales of haunts or threats of hard work. How
lucky that old Gershom Born had come to the Outposts and told him
he owned a house and one tenth of Rockbound. He had faced down
the old king in the first encounter, and wondered at his own
courage.</p>
<p>He chuckled as he sat by his rusty stove and started from his
reverie. He must get some rest against to-morrow's work. He
walked over to the couch on which Richard Covey had died, and
throwing himself down, drew a sack over his feet, and after the
manner of all fishermen, who even on the darkest night fear that
the moon may peep out and shine upon them sleeping, wrapped
another sack about his head. He had no fear of Richard Covey's
haunt; he was used to loneliness in dark corners. In two minutes
he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>When David woke with a start it was still dark, but he threw
off his rough covering and went quickly to the door. Away to the
eastward dark mountains of morning clouds lowered, but the
offshore breeze had pushed out the fog bank, and the stars
twinkled through. As he had never owned watch or clock, he had
learned to use the great bowl of the universe as an approximate
timepiece. He looked up into the northern sky and saw the dipper,
in relation to the pole star, hanging in the position of V on a
clock dial, and knew from memories of previous nights that it was
between two and three o'clock. There was no time to lose if he
meant to show Uriah and the Jung boys his worth. He threw a bag
about his shoulders, tied it at his neck with a bit of marline,
tore off a thick heel from Anapest's loaf, thrust one half in his
pocket for lunch, and gnawing the other half, ran for the launch,
his bare feet scattering the dew from heavily bent grasses across
the path.</p>
<p>Early as he was, he was none too early! A squat dark object
moving swiftly from boats to fish house he knew was Uriah. Casper
and Martin were not about yet--Casper, the farmer by instinct,
was always last to get his boat off in the morning--but Joseph
had shoved the <i>Lettie</i> over on her bilge and was greasing
her keel. Neither spoke to him. David went over to the
<i>Ph&oelig;be,</i> pushed her over on her side, fumbled in the
dark for a stick, which he too dipped in the tub of stinking
gurry, and greased her keel so that she would slip easily down
the ways. As the seas often run fiercely even on the northern and
sheltered side of the island, Rockbound boats never lie at a
mooring but are hauled out high and dry as soon as they touch the
launch.</p>
<p>Uriah waddled out of the gloom of the fish house with a basket
full of herrings.</p>
<p>"Dere's yur bait, an' dere's an extry line, a box o' hooks,
an' two odd sinkers."</p>
<p>David righted the <i>Ph&oelig;be,</i> lifted the basket into
her, and set it down by the centreboard without a word.</p>
<p>"Got nair a pair o' nippers?" queried the old man.</p>
<p>"I don't need no nippers. I'se fished on de Gran' Banks, an'
me hands is tough."</p>
<p>"You best foller Joe; he knows w'ere de big schools o' fish
lays dis season ob de year."</p>
<p>David grunted something in reply, but he had no mind to follow
Joe or any of them; he would lead or nuttin'; he hadn't fished
out o' de Outposts for naught; he knowed where de fish layed well
as Joe. He set his shoulder to the stem of the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i>
and started her down the ways. First she moved slowly, then
gathered speed, and as his foot felt the chill of the salt water
on the last log, she seemed to be flying. With his left hand
grasping the jib stay, he gave a mighty spring and rolled in over
the port washboard. Joseph, whose boat was already afloat,
listened with the malicious hope that he would hear a great
splash, betokening that, in the darkness, David had missed the
logs set at unaccustomed spaces and been dragged off waist deep
by the flying <i>Ph&oelig;be,</i> as he had seen many a green
sharesman dragged before. But David, safely aboard, grasped a
sweep and rushed quickly astern to fend her off the ledge and
turn her head to the westward; then, darting swiftly forward, he
made halliards and creaking blocks sing, and the big brown
mainsail rose and bellied to the puff of the shore wind. Astern
he rushed to shove his tiller hard aport and rattle in the main
sheet till his sail was flat. Up came the <i>Ph&oelig;be's</i>
bow into the wind. Now, setting the tiller in a middle notch, he
darted forward again to hoist his jib and belay the halliard,
back astern again to haul in and make fast his jib sheet. All his
motions were swift and catlike; his bare feet gripped the wet
surface of thwart and washboard.</p>
<p>When he had time to look about him, he noted that the breeze
was from the northwest and that he could just clear the dull
black mass of West Head by jogging the <i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>
Joseph's boat was a hundred yards ahead of him. He tugged at the
rusty pin of his centreboard and let the chain go clanking down;
it would slow the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> up a little, but keep her
from drifting to leeward in this light breeze. Joseph made a
short tack to the northward to weather the head, but David held
straight on.</p>
<p>"Don't go in dere, de water's shoal," bawled Joseph.</p>
<p>But David pretended not to hear and held to his course; there
would be plenty of time to come about when the iron centreboard
bumped and bobbed up. The <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> was handy, he knew,
for from the Outpost boats he had seen her luff up and come about
a hundred times before she turned over with Mark, and he knew her
points as a jockey knows the strengths and weaknesses of his
rival's horses. He cleared West Head just outside the breakers
and passed inside the Grampus with Joseph's boat, in spite of her
tack, still fifty yards ahead. He let main and jib sheet run now
and stood away to the southeast. With a long-handled gaff he
winged out his jib, pulled up his centreboard, and watched to see
if he was creeping up on the <i>Lettie.</i> Joseph's boat held
her lead. The <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> was fast but crank, and Uriah
had loaded her with ballast since she drowned Mark: four hundred
pounds of beach rocks lay along her keelson.</p>
<p>"To hell wid ballast, dat makes a boat hard to get up an' off
de launch; I'll ballast my boat wid fish," thought David, and
stooping he tossed two hundred pounds of beach rocks into the
sea. Then the lightened <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> began to draw up on
the <i>Lettie,</i> and as David sailed his boat close to the
<i>Lettie's</i> quarter, to take the quick puffs from her sails,
he was soon abreast of Joseph's boat and little by little drew
ahead. Now he was leading the Jung boys, first of the Rockbound
fleet; Martin's boat showed dimly outside the Grampus, and
Casper's trailed far behind. Daylight was coming gradually.</p>
<p>When he was well ahead and well to the southward of Barren
Island, he hauled in his sails flat and stood away again to the
westward toward his favourite bank. A landsman who looks at the
even surface of the sea and whose acquaintance with the bottom is
limited to slightly pitched bathing beaches thinks of the
seafloor as flat and level. Not so it appeared to the mind of
David, who from frequent soundings with a cod line visualized it
truly as composed of hills, mountain ranges, deep valleys, sharp
cañons, buttes, and wide plateaus. It was futile, he knew, to
drop his baited hooks in a valley, for on the tops of the ridges
and shallow plateaus lay the cod, waiting for schools of herring
and squid to drift over. The finding and exact location of these
shallow plateaus called banks by the fishermen seems to the
uninitiated, who sees only miles upon miles of waves that look
everywhere the same, nothing short of marvellous. They are marked
by alignments of distant islands, by cross bearings, and time
courses run by the compass.</p>
<p>To his favourite bank in the open sea, southwest from Barren
Island and south-southeast from Lubeck Island light, David
steered the <i>Ph&oelig;be,</i> that, lightened of her ballast,
heeled over and put her lee washboard under in the freshening
breeze. Presently he rounded his boat up, let the jib run,
dropped the peak of his mainsail, but held fast the throat, so
that the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> would ride to the wind, and tossed
over his grapnel. Over went his double-baited line, with his
sinker he sounded bottom, twelve fathom, and he drew up a fathom
to keep his hooks clear of the weeds on the sea floor. He began
to saw patiently, but nothing happened; in half an hour he caught
only two small rock cod. His heart sank; he could scarcely face
Uriah on his first day with an empty boat. He would be cursed for
not following Joseph as instructed. What was the matter? He had
always caught fish on this bank before. Presently he ran forward,
hove up his grapnel, hoisted jib and peak again, and stood
farther to the westward toward Matt's Bank.</p>
<p>Again he anchored and tried. This time he was on the fish; ten
seconds after his baited hooks reached bottom, a pair of big cod
flashed over his gunwale and were snapped into the fish pen. The
fish bit fiercely; as soon as the hooks were down came a tug on
the line; then, after a few seconds of swift hand-over-hand
pulling, gray forms with twirling white bellies showed dimly in
the green depths. He gave himself no rest, but pulled and hauled,
baited and rebaited for three hours. Once a strange boat drew up
to him, and David, with two great cod hooked that twisted and
tangled his snoods, let his line rest on the bottom.</p>
<p>"Air a fish?" hailed the stranger.</p>
<p>"A scatterin' rock cod," called back David lying stoutly. When
the boat was well away, he pulled up his fish and repaired his
snarled snoods. By nine, when the fish stopped biting his fish
pens were two thirds full and the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> had but a
streak and a half clear.</p>
<p>The breeze dropped, and the sun shone warm to dry his shirt
and trousers, soaked from the spray of the hand line. He squatted
tailor-wise on his bit of deck by the jib stay, and though both
hands were bleeding from the run of the burning hand line, he
felt happier than he had for many a day. On the sea he was a free
man and his own master. The corners of his mouth drooped in his
quizzical smile as he thought how Joe, Martin, and Casper would
curse when he came in high-line on his first day. And high-line
he certainly would be. He drew out his heel of dampened bread and
devoured it ravenously, washing it down with deep draughts from
the <i>Ph&oelig;be's</i> water jug that Uriah had stuck in the
bows. Uriah was mean and greedy, but he knew how to fit out a
sharesman, thought David, and he kept his boats tight.</p>
<p>As he ate and looked about him at the sunlit water and enjoyed
the sway of the boat that rocked him as if he were
cradled--little cradling had he had as a child--he saw a great
swirl and a dozen splashes dead astern to the southward. Then
black backs flashed on the surface.</p>
<p>"Playin' pollock," said David to himself. He knew what to do
for them. He stuffed the last crust into his mouth, seized his
line, cut off the heavy leaden sinker, and, wrapping both hooks
with guts torn from a fat herring, let his line trail astern near
the surface. Snap, and he was fast to two pollock! Over and over
again he repeated the operation, till he dared not lay another
fish aboard the <i>Ph&oelig;be,</i> clear only by half a streak
from the gunwale. He tried his pump till she sucked clear. It was
a pity to leave those tens of thousands of playing pollock; if an
Outposter came near he would hail him. However, no boat neared
him.</p>
<p>In the offing far to the eastward, he could see the black
specks of Joseph's, Casper's, and Martin's boats bunched near the
Rock. It would be a long, hard beat home; the little breeze that
remained, puffy and variable, still hung in the nor'west. Far out
on the sea rested a thick stratum of fog bank, through which a
three-master loomed, with spars unearthly high. He rested
patiently, awaiting a breeze, knowing that the wind often hauled
at noontime. Before twelve came a draught from the sou'west; luck
favoured him that day. He let out his mainsail to catch the
quartering breeze and rested happy at the tiller. Then the other
Rockbound boats made sail and stood in. By their speed he judged
them light; they would be home long before him.</p>
<p>The southwest breeze had caught the fog bank half an hour
before it touched the sails of the <i>Ph&oelig;be,</i> and the
fog travelled faster than the boats. Presently the sun sickened,
the islands dimmed to a dull gray, and black specks that meant
boats were blotted out. David took a course on Rockbound before
the fog shut out the island, and kept his ears alert for the
sound of breakers. The deep-laden <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> moved
sullenly, her jib flirting from side to side of the stay with a
vixenish snap. Now, had David had a draught of rum, or even pipe
and tobacco, he would have been comforted, for the stoutest heart
is lonely on a fog-shrouded sea.</p>
<p>In two hours time he heard the smash of surf and, standing
close in and staring eagerly, made out the black form of sou'west
gutter rock. He steered west now, hugging the dim black of the
cliff, and dared again to round West Head inside the Grampus,
lest he should lose touch with the shore. Then he jibbed, hauled
flat, and stood for the launch, letting out a great "Hallo."
Uriah was at the launch with the oxen, and, as his prow took the
logs, hooked the wire cable into his stem ring.</p>
<p>"Go easy," yelled David, "she's deep."</p>
<p>"I'se hauled out boats while you was yet suckin'," retorted
Uriah, starting his oxen with a mighty "Gee Bright."</p>
<p>"How much do ye hail?" queried Uriah as the boat reached the
top of the launch.</p>
<p>"Six quintal," answered David proudly. Casper came out and
stared in his fish pens.</p>
<p>"Scale fish," said he contemptuously, handling the
pollock.</p>
<p>"No dey's not scale fish," said David. "Dere's a few
scatterin' pollocks on top, underneat's all big cod."</p>
<p>Uriah said naught to David; silence and absence of complaint
were ever his loudest praise, but he had a word to say to Joseph,
Martin, and Casper in a corner of the fish house. David hailed
more that day than the three brothers put together. In all his
years on Rockbound, he never had a better day's fishing nor a
greater triumph.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When David had been fishing a fortnight off Rockbound, the
dogfish came and drove in the boats from the Rock and adjacent
banks. It was no good trying for cod when dogfish were
about--even Uriah admitted that--they chased the cod and did
nothing but tangle and destroy the fisherman's gear. Still, the
boats went out each morning in the hope that the fisherman's pest
had vanished; a few unavailing trials, and they returned early.
David had hoped for some afternoons of rest and leisure, but that
was not part of Uriah's plan, who put him to work tanning
nets.</p>
<p>About noon on one such day, Joseph, the sly one, went to Cow
Pasture Hill on the west end to stake out his young bull. When he
came to the cliff's edge and looked down from the height into the
green water, he saw that Sheer Net Cove was alive with herring.
They darted to and fro or lay by millions on the yellow sand of
the cove's bottom. That could not long be kept a secret, and he
knew that the Krauses had their nets and seine laid in their
seine boat, whereas the seine of the Jungs was in the upper loft.
If the Jungs started to get out their herring seine, the Krauses
would see them, launch first, and get round the fish. He thought
for a moment, ruffling up his black hair, then ran through the
thick spruces on the back of the island, and, bending low to
escape observation, dashed across bar and sand beach and made his
way into the thick woods on the eastern end. After a moment's
pause to catch his breath he came running down the road from the
eastern end bellowing: "De herrin', de herrin' is in on de shore
in millions."</p>
<p>What a hurry and scramble was there then! Uriah puffed to the
loft and tore down the herring seine; down the stairs stamped
Casper with an armful of ropes, grapnels, and net buoys; Joseph
followed with two baskets of sinker rocks; young Gershom Born ran
to and fro, shouting and waving his arms as he gathered up
equipment, with Noble Morash following sullenly in his wake;
David greased bottoms of seine boats and dories. Do what they
could, the Kraus boats were off first, but the Krauses, deceived
by Joseph's ruse, pulled madly for the eastern end. Only when
they were well out of hearing Joseph said:</p>
<p>"Quick now, de herrin's in de Sheer Net Cove an' we kin git
dere first."</p>
<p>Casper, who excelled in net fishing, led the fleet of Jung
boats around the western end of the island. One man tugged
viciously at the oars, and another sat straddling the bows,
peering down into the green water, not more than three fathom
deep, for the edge of the herring school. Young Gershom Born, the
most powerful oarsman, pulled the boat in which Casper was the
watcher; David pulled the second boat with Noble Morash in the
bows, and Martin, the weakest oarsman, trailed behind with Joseph
straddling his bows.</p>
<p>"Here are herrin'! Here are herrin'!" Joseph and Noble began
to shout from the rear boats.</p>
<p>"Not enough yet," bawled Casper from the leading boat. Over
the yellow sands the green-backed herring raced in schools so
thick and opaque that the sea floor was hidden.</p>
<p>"Shoot here, shoot here," yelled Joseph in his anxiety to beat
the Krauses. "Lot's o' herrin' here, ain't it!"</p>
<p>"Not yet, not yet!" shouted Casper. When the boats came to the
mouth of the rocky Sheer Net Cove, Casper raised his hand as a
signal to shoot. He took his boat close to the breakers, cast
over the end of the seine, tying on rock sinkers with a swift and
adroit hand as he paid it out, while Gershom Born, the great
blond sharesman, strained at the oars and tugged the heavy seine
boat, heavier now with the drag of the seine, westward to sea.
Then, at a signal from Casper's hand, he made a sharp turn
northward to the right, again a signal, another sharp turn to the
eastward, and millions of herring were penned in the cove. The
ends of the seine were brought together and tied; now it floated
in a great corked circle, the vibrant water within crowded with
herrings, a tumult of blues and greens. At the first rush of the
imprisoned fish against the outer twine, the seaward corks went
under.</p>
<p>"Quick, Dave, quick man, git on de buoys," bawled Casper, "or
de fish will git ober de top."</p>
<p>The seaward head ropes were dragged up on the prows of boats
to hold up the seine till the white fir-wood buoys could be tied
on, and Joseph and Martin ran out moorings and grapnels to north,
west, and south, to hold the seine against the rush of the
tide.</p>
<p>Still, in spite of the light fir-wood net buoys, the seaward
head ropes dipped under, for the seine twine was now white with
meshed herring; the smaller fry darted through the meshes and to
sea again.</p>
<p>"Quick, now, Dave, wid de nets," bawled Casper. David was
everyone's slave; everyone called orders to the newest and lowest
sharesman. He did not care for this herring fishing, where there
was little chance for individual action: his great moments were
when, on the open sea, he was alone in the <i>Ph&oelig;be.</i> As
long as the herring were in, he knew that the boat he already
loved because it gave him freedom would lie dry on the
launch.</p>
<p>Over the head ropes went dories and seine boats, and the
inside of the seine was circled with a fleet of nets that were
drawn into a smaller circle. Gershom Born, blue-eyed Viking,
hurled in the jiggler, a stone tied with a rope to pieces of
white wood. This he flounced up and down, to scare more fish into
meshes of net or seine. Noble Morash, the gaunt, black-bearded,
silent sharesman, and David darted their spruce oars to the
bottom, and when they bobbed from the surface like the sword
Excalibur, caught them neatly by the handles, to drive them down
again among the frightened fish. Once Noble Morash drove his into
deep water, and when the oar handle did not reappear in the usual
rhythmic time, he peeped over the gunwale to see if his oar blade
had caught in a cleft of the rock bottom. Whereupon the oar
handle shot out, caught him between the eyes, and knocked him
flat and half stunned into the bottom of the boat. There was a
yell of laughter in which David joined. That was a first-rate
Rockbound joke to be recounted for many a day. Noble Morash rose,
mopping the blood from his nose, and glared savagely at David
with his narrow, sinister eyes. He would show the new sharesman
if he could laugh at him, even if he were Uriah's kinsman.</p>
<p>"Herrin'! Herrin'!" they screamed at one another as if they
had never seen a fish before.</p>
<p>"We got two hundred barrels, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"We got five hundred barrels."</p>
<p>"Chuck in dat giggler."</p>
<p>"Souse her up an' down."</p>
<p>"De herrin's not bin in on de shore like dis fur twenty
year."</p>
<p>David caught the spirit and like the rest became a wild
fisherman, intoxicated with the great catch of herring, shouting,
gesticulating, taking his turn with the heavy giggler, driving
down the oars. Presently the Kraus boats hove up alongside; the
Krauses had taken no fish and eyed the Jungs resentfully, though
they had not got to the bottom of Joseph's ruse.</p>
<p>The inner net, heavy with fat, gleaming herring meshed from
both sides, was hauled now, each end in a separate boat. David
and Noble Morash in their boat dragged in head and foot rope and
shook the fish into the boat's bottom a half bushel at a time, or
tore out those that stuck fast in the twine with a rending of
gills and sometimes the loss of a head. When they strode from bow
to stern now, they waded knee deep in herring. Lower and lower
sank seine boat and dories, till only single streaks were clear.
When the net was picked, it was again circled within the seine.
Outside giant albacore in pursuit of the herring splashed and
swirled the waves into foam.</p>
<p>"Bring in de spare boats," bawled Casper, and in they floated
over the head ropes.</p>
<p>David glanced up from his work once in a while to admire the
little cove in which these Jungs shouted and toiled unmindful of
any beauty about them. It was closed to the eastward, and partly
to the northward and southward, by sheer cliffs of slaty black
and iron-red rocks, seamed and fish-boned with cracks from some
pre-historic fire. The slanting afternoon sun filled these rocks
with light and cast deep shadows in the clefts. Above the cliffs
ran in a fine curve a narrow margin of green turf crowned with
masses of stunted wind-blown spruces crowding like horses in a
gale, tails to the sea wind. The cliff-fallen boulders at the
foot were clad with raw-sienna rockweed, and among these the
green sea washed with a bang and a roar, lashing itself, even on
this comparatively calm day, into a fury of foam and creamy
lather. It seemed like a dream to David, and that he was dreamer
and a part of the dream.</p>
<p>There they laboured together, great shouldered, red faced,
clad in yellow oil pants, shouting, gesticulating, pulling on
head ropes, hurling the giggler, darting oars, balancing on
thwarts or gunwale with all the grace of athletes, tearing out
shining fish tangled in brown meshes, wild with greed and
excitement, though they had done this a hundred times before.
Beneath the yellow dories that were down close to the gunwales
the sea, patched in green and black, was vibrant with backs of
frightened herring, racing madly about nets and seine in their
effort to escape.</p>
<p>Again they hauled the fleet of nets and picked them. The sun
was low over Flat Island now, and the boats could carry no more.
Reluctantly Casper gave the order to set a fleet of nets about
the remnant of the school and to take up the moorings of the big
seine, which they dared not leave overnight so close to the
shore.</p>
<p>Home they rowed in the twilight, deep-laden seine boat and
dories dragging wearily. Uriah was waiting at the launch with his
oxen to draw out the boats. From him came no word of praise.</p>
<p>"You got to be quick now, boys," he cried. "It's Saturday, an'
I neber works on de Lord's Day, me nor my fader before me." And
to David, "Git a snack an' be back quick. Dese herrin' got to be
dressed by midnight. Quick, now, we don't want no loafers on
Rockbound." This, after he had fished on the Rock before daybreak
and tugged at the heavy seine through a long afternoon.</p>
<p>David, with back and shoulders aching, rushed off to his house
and tore ravenously at a crust of bread and a piece of salt fish.
He would show the old man if he was a loafer; in five minutes he
was back at the fish house, just as Joseph was coming down the
road. Uriah was waiting for him, Uriah the king, who neither ate
nor slept while fish were on the floor.</p>
<p>"You boys is awful slow. Why, in de ole days me an' my brudder
Simeon stood on yon beach an' gibbed eighty barrels of mackerel
an' never stirred from dere from tree one afternoon till sundown
nex' day. Men could work in dem days. Here you, David, look
alive, run dat spare dory down de launch an' fill her wid water
while I fetches de cattle."</p>

<p>Lanterns hung from the thick brown beams made spots of yellow
light, but dimly illuminated the dusky corners of the great fish
house which Uriah's father and uncle, George and Edward Jung, had
built from the wreckage of vessels lost on the Rockbound shoals.
In the southwest corner was the salt bin, holding hundreds of
bushels of wetted yellow salt taken from the bankers in
September; along the southern side stood row upon row of
puncheons full of pickled cod, mackerel, and herring, the
mackerel and herring to be packed in smaller barrels and carried
to the main from time to time, and the cod to be laid on rocks
and flakes, when the September sun came with heat enough to make
the fish without burning them. On top of the puncheons were piled
nets, hand barrows, trawl buoys, decoys, and lobster pots, in a
welter of confusion. About the beams and in niches of wall or
studding were hung or stuck articles of fishermen's use--cotton
gloves, nippers, hanks of cod line, finger stalls, and spare
splitting knives. In the east end of the room was the flat
salting table rimmed with a strip of wood and piled high with
yellow salt and gleaming herring. The floor of beech and maple
planking, salvaged from a wrecked ship, still showed the trunnel
holes and was soaked with the brine and blood of seventy years.
In mid-floor stood big tubs, half puncheons, some filled with sea
water for washing the fish, some to catch torn-out milt and roe,
and some to receive the herring guts, these last to be carried
out and spread upon the new-mown timothy land. Tiny spots of
light were caught and reflected from thousands of fish scales
that sequinned tubs, blood-empurpled floor, and yellow
oilskins.</p>
<p>Beneath a swaying lantern, where he could watch and command
all, sat Uriah, his swift, keen knife ripping open the bellies of
herrings, his horny thumb, unprotected against sharp bones by
glove or stall, tearing out entrails or roe to be thrown into the
appropriate tub.</p>
<p>"Dese ain't de fish dat was here in April; dese is he fish
mostly; dey's full o' milt." He kept up a conversation to make
the boys forget their weariness and to drive them on to work.</p>
<p>"My body's good but my legs's gone," said he in apology for
sitting on a box. "But I kin still split fish wid ere a man. Me
an' my brudder Simeon stood on yon beach an' split eighty barrels
o' mackerel from tree one afternoon till sundown nex' day an'
never stirred nor eat 'cept when de women folks poked a piece o'
bread in our mouf. Dere ain't no men kin work so now'days, ain't
it!"</p>
<p>"Men's jus' as good now'days, Fader, but times is changed,"
growled Casper from the salting table.</p>
<p>"Jus' as good, is it?" jeered the old man. "An' here's dis
crew wonderin' if dey kin gib fifty barrels o' herrin' 'fore
midnight."</p>
<p>Uriah, the king, a man of seventy, wore a battered straw hat;
his squat figure was clad in yellow oilskins and rubber boots. He
had a short grizzled beard, his right eye drooped, and an upward
twitch in the right corner of his mouth suggested that some day
he would suffer a stroke of paralysis. He was rich, avaricious,
and had a passion for work; he slept little, was tireless, and
drove everyone before him. He ripped open fish with lightning
darts of his swift knife and tore out guts with remorseless
hand.</p>
<p>"Jus' as good, is it! Jus' as good, is it! I'd 'a' liked to
seen you boys keep yur end up when me an' my brudder Simeon was
young men," he jeered. "Ain't it, Sim?" yelled Uriah, for Simeon
was deaf.</p>
<p>"Ay, so it be, Ury," answered old Simeon, though he had heard
never a word of the preceding conversation.</p>
<p>Simeon, the old dotard, worn out with seventy years of
incessant labour, sat in a dim corner gibbing feebly. His head
bobbed to and fro as he split, a perpetual fond smile was on his
face, and saliva drooled from the corners of his mouth. Only the
shadow of a man, still working from habit of work, remained.</p>
<p>Joseph, Uriah's son, and Noble Morash, the gaunt black
sharesman, emerged from the darkness lugging a barrow piled up
with herrings from the boats, and dumped them with a smack on the
soaked floor, to add to the great slithering pile already
there.</p>
<p>"More work fur de women an' ole men," said Joseph gaily.</p>
<p>Uriah snorted and began, "When me an' my brudder Simeon . .
."</p>
<p>But Joseph waited not to hear; he was always in a hurry; he
never walked, he ran. He was avaricious and loved money like his
father, and was already the slave of labour. He hustled Noble
Morash out into the darkness again to fetch water from the
drawn-up dory for the washing tubs. Joseph was a huge fellow with
broad shoulders and slim hips and legs; he had a hawk nose,
brick-red face, and piercing blue eyes. He was clad like the
others in yellow oilskins, long boots, and sou'wester. His
nostrils were well cut up on the side, and his face had somehow a
strange Turkish or Oriental caste. Uriah had married a Levy from
Little Outpost, and the Levys, time out o' mind Baptists, had
once been German Jews, though none knew what had converted them,
unless it had been the wearisome argument of the sea. Joseph was
a money maker, a shrewd bargainer, who peddled cabbages and
mackerel through the streets of Liscomb when there was no sale on
the wharves; he kept the wooden box into which the Jungs put
their common earnings to be divided at the end of each month with
much acrimony and mutual distrust. He darted to and fro in the
spotty light, sousing the split herrings in the washing tub,
transferring them to the second tub, or scooping them out in a
dip net, to carry them and smack them down on Casper's salting
table. While he kept up a foolish chatter, his thoughts ran
thus:</p>
<p>"Fifty barrels at six dollars a barrel is three hundred
dollars cash money, and a fifth part of that will be mine, and
I'll put it in the bank with the rest. Sixty dollars more for me,
and some day next autumn I'll go to the bank in Liscomb and get
the cashman to count my money all over for me and tell me again
it's all there."</p>
<p>It was a Saturday night, and Uriah knew in his heart that they
could not gib the fifty barrels of herring before midnight.</p>
<p>"Me and my brudder Simeon nor my fader before us neber worked
on de Lord's Day," he said to spur them on.</p>
<p>"Did us, Sim?" he yelled.</p>
<p>"Dat's a fac', dat's a fac'," babbled the old dotard.</p>
<p>Uriah's thoughts, however, were as follows: "T'ree hunderd
dollars fur dis lot; what a pity to-morrow's Sunday! If de leas'
sea gits up, de herrin' will go off in deep water, an' we'll have
to use sunk nets. My boys is tough, dey don't need no day o'
rest, an' dey can't shoot de seine till broad daylight on Monday,
for you can't see a herrin' on de bottom till two hours arter
sun-up. The Lord should give me a big jewel in my crown for
laying dis crew off to-morrow. T'ree hundred dollars gone!" and
he groaned inwardly.</p>
<p>Uriah's wife, the Levy from Little Outpost, sat in a darkened
corner gibbing silently. She was a big woman with a placid face,
who had endured many hardships with fortitude. She was by fifteen
years Uriah's junior and had borne him fourteen children. Eight
of them had died at birth, for when the fish came plentifully she
had worked every night in the fish house, or toiled in potato and
cabbage patches even when her time was approaching. Everyone must
work on Uriah's island from long before sunrise to dark. She
listened not at all to the babble of conversation; she had heard
it all before in a hundred variations, and understood Uriah's
drift. She sat thinking of the time when she had been a little
girl, of her grandfather's long gray beard, and of a big black
book with curious printing he used to read in. She thought, too,
of the time when she had first seen Uriah, as her father's boat
passed close to his in the ships' channel between Big and Little
Outpost, and how he came soon after to court her on Sundays. She
had been proud to be courted by the best fisherman on the whole
coast; then Uriah was daring and a wonder in a boat, now he had
become mean and cautious and seldom ventured on the sea.</p>
<p>Near her were two of her daughters, Ruth and Tamar, girls
still in their teens drafted into this forced labour. The herring
must not go soft or spoil, though men and women wore themselves
out. They chattered and giggled to themselves and cast eyes at
David, the new ragged sharesman, who, working like a trojan, sat
with downcast glance listening to all and saying never a word.
His shoulders ached, his hands bled from deep cracks, for all the
week before he had fished with squid bait, but he squatted on his
heels near the herring pile, working furiously and disdaining a
seat as if he were a man of iron.</p>
<p>Fanny, the potato girl, and Gershom Born, the blond Viking,
kept up a continual banter. Gershom was obscene in his remarks
when he was sure Uriah and his wife were not listening. Fanny
slept in the loft with the sharesmen, since there was no other
place to sleep, and Gershom was often the companion of her bed.
In fact, Fanny refused none of the great sharesmen, though
Gershom was her favourite, her only proviso being that they
washed themselves and put on a clean shirt before coming to her.
Fanny was pretty, of moderate height and stoutly built; she had
yellow hair, blue eyes, and a kindly, placid face. As she threw
back to Gershom Born some chat none too proper, her white teeth
flashed in a pleasant smile. David looked shyly at her with
wonder. As yet he knew nothing of women except Jennie Run-over
and the trollops she had kept in her house on Outpost. He kept on
glancing at Fanny out of the corners of his slitty eyes and found
pleasure in her beauty. Tamar caught his sidelong glances and
nudged Ruth and giggled.</p>
<p>Fanny was certainly a fine creature, but her morals were those
of the birds. She came from Big Outpost to hoe Uriah's cabbages
and potatoes, since the men had no time to work about gardens.
Moreover, gardening was distinctly woman's work. All day long she
hoed and weeded and gave a hand at night in the fish house, as
did all the island women when a run of fish came. She trudged
home from the fields in the late afternoon, hoe over her
shoulder, whistling blithely. Before supper she always went to
the beach, stripped and washed herself--little cared she if the
men peeked--and put on a clean shirt and a fresh dress of blue
and white in tiny checks. Her dresses, scrupulously washed and
ironed, were kept in her father's sea chest in the loft by her
bed. In the midst of all the dirt, stench, and disorder, she had
an instinct, well-nigh a passion, for tidiness. In another
setting she might have borne herself with the greatest lady in
the land. She was great-hearted and could never refuse a strong
fisherman half-crazed with lonely passion. When the women talked
to her and said: "A little of dat's all right maybe when you'se
young, but if you keeps on you'se'll never git a man," she used
to reply, "We was made for de good of mens, an' mens is going to
have me." If Uriah and his wife, she thought, cared so much for
morals, why had they put her and Leah Levy to sleep in the loft
with the sharesmen?</p>
<p>Sure enough, she never got a man, but she bore three daughters
that grew into stout lasses, knowing no more than Fanny who were
their fathers. In after years Gershom used to say, "I t'ink de
pretty one wid de yaller hair mus' be mine, but de dark ugly one
favours Noble Morash." Fanny saved her pennies and looked after
herself, and when she was too old to work bought a little white
cottage in Liscomb. When she was very old and felt herself at the
point of death, she sent for her three daughters, but they
refused to come. They had all married and were ashamed of their
mother. One morning the neighbours found her dead on her
clean-valanced couch, even in death smiling bravely upon a world
that had taken her all and paid nothing in return.</p>
<p>But that is going far ahead of this story, for the Fanny who
bickered with Gershom Born that night in the fish house was only
a wild, gay girl of eighteen. She wore, like the others, oilskins
spattered with herring blood, and a sou'wester to protect her
yellow hair.</p>
<p>The stench, a strange mixture of odours from gurry tubs,
ancient fish heads, lobster shells, wetted salt, and
gore-drenched floor, almost intolerable to a stranger, was hardly
noticed by these tough Rockbounders. Smells, noxious or pleasant,
are like everything else relative--there is a fine nuance from a
delicate perfume to an ugly stench--and matters of habit and
custom. Indeed, the crafty old king, unconscious of the noisome
odours, was thinking, as his knife flashed in and out and his
facile thumb gouged the bellies of herrings:</p>
<p>"De rent's comin' due dis quarter on my house in Liscomb.
Dat'll make more money to go in de bank. What's dat fool woman
mean by wantin' a backhouse off de kitchen? She mus' be crazy!
Does she want to stink up de whole place? Dey don't need no
backhouse, anyhow. Why can't dey go on de beach like us?"</p>
<p>Casper, at the salting table, a great-shouldered giant like
Joseph, kept seizing a split herring in each hand and pushing
them together through the salt pile till their bellies were
crammed with salt. Then he laid the fish in piles, and when the
piles were about to topple, he grabbed the salt-stuffed herrings
and packed them in a puncheon.</p>
<p>"Quick, Dave, my boy, more salt," he cried, wishing to show
his authority. "Quick now, look alive; we ain't got all
night."</p>
<p>Casper was the oldest of the Jung boys, but Joseph was the
natural leader, a driver, the joy of his father, though for some
strange reason Uriah loved Martin, the youngest boy, best of all.
David, at Casper's call, stuck his knife in a strip of studding,
darted for the salt bin, and emerged in a moment with a bushel
basket heaped with salt, which he carried swiftly across the room
and dumped on the salting table. Then he was back at his place in
a flash, splitting, flashing his knife in and out, gouging out
entrails with thumb and fingers, his back and shoulders well-nigh
numb with fatigue. No one gibbed more herring than David that
night. He would work till he dropped dead, he resolved, before a
Rockbound Jung should see he was tired.</p>
<p>Uriah did not like Casper for a number of reasons. In the
first place, Casper had never married, while Joseph and Martin
had buxom wives both present splitting fish, who had borne them
several children. Moreover, Casper argued with the king, and
worse than that, he had lost money for him. Ten years earlier
Casper had had one grand adventure: he had gone West with the
harvesters. Uriah perhaps resented the fact that Casper had dared
to leave his kingdom, or dared to prefer any other place to
Rockbound, more than the loss of his money. In the West, some
crafty real estate man had shown the grasping Casper how to
treble his money quickly. It was such a sure thing that Casper
had written to Uriah to send him a thousand dollars, meaning to
pay the old man well and keep a snug commission for himself. Then
land went flat, Casper lost everything, and in a year or two
straggled home by hard stages. Before his departure, he had kept
the money box, but on his return he had found Joseph ensconced as
banker. In his heart he feared and hated the sea and dreaded
rough foggy mornings near the Rock; he was a farmer by instinct,
happiest when he drove his slow yoke of oxen afield to bring in
the hay, or to haul a load of sea dung from the beaches. In spite
of Uriah's jibes, his boat was always the last off the launch of
a morning, and the first in, if a wind breezed up or fog shut out
the islands. He could read and write and knew more of the outside
world than any man on Rockbound. By nature, however, he was
envious and argumentative, and in recent years had developed,
through reading the Old Testament, a curious anti-religious
tendency that angered Uriah, whose heart was set on acquiring all
the money he could on earth, and insuring a crown of glory in
heaven. As Casper stood under the yellow glow of his swinging
lantern, his hands flying to and fro as he pushed salt into the
bellies of herrings, he was thinking:</p>
<p>"If I had e'er a wife and kids, I wouldn't have dat Ole
Testament round de house. It's full o' tales o' concubines and
kept women and old whorin' stories. Why, if e'er a child o' mine
brung home a book wid stories like dat in it, I'd burn de book
and whip de child."</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Uriah, as if conscious of Casper's thought,
stood off on a theological tack. He often got the boys stirred up
over a religious discussion toward eleven of a heavy evening.</p>
<p>"Ain't Egypt to de east'ard o' de Promised Land, Casper?"</p>
<p>"Dat it is, Fader, from de maps in de books," replied Casper
readily but inaccurately, wondering what his father was driving
at. Casper did not know that Uriah's wife had been reading to him
the night before of the captivity of the Children of Israel.</p>
<p>"I t'ought so."</p>
<p>"Why you t'ought so, Fader?"</p>
<p>"'Cause I does," said Uriah, wishing to prolong the mystery
and get full credit for having thought out this particular bit of
exegesis. "'Cause I does, from meditatin' on de captivity o' de
Children o' Israel."</p>
<p>"An' what might ye o' bin t'inkin', an' what's it got to do
wid Egypt bein' to be east'ard o' de Promised Land?"</p>
<p>"Well, don't de good Book say de Children o' Israel went
<i>down</i> into Egypt, an' don't we say go <i>down to de
east'ard</i> to Marmot and <i>up to de west'ard</i> to
Liscomb?"</p>
<p>"Dat up an' down don't mean nuttin'," muttered Casper.</p>
<p>"It do, it do," shrilled Uriah.</p>
<p>"De folks on de Outposts, dey says <i>up</i> to de east'ard
and <i>down</i> to de west'ard. Don't dey, Gershom?"</p>
<p>Gershom, deep in an undertoned amorous conversation with Fanny
and unaware of the general drift of the argument, bellowed in his
booming voice:</p>
<p>"Us Outposters says <i>down</i> to de bottom o' de sea."</p>
<p>Then he laughed his great laugh to think how cleverly he had
avoided partisanship, for he liked neither Uriah nor Casper, and
went on telling Fanny one of his adventures at Jennie
Run-over's.</p>
<p>"De Outposters is wrong about eberyt'ing," shouted Uriah. "Dey
don't know how to work. Why, me an' my brudder Simeon, when we
was young mens . . ." and then, suddenly recalling that the
argument was theological, reverted to his <i>down-east</i>
theory, "Us here on Rockbound says <i>down to de east'ard,</i>
jus' like de good Book says."</p>
<p>"Dat <i>up</i> an' <i>down's</i> child's talk," retorted
Casper stubbornly.</p>
<p>Noble Morash, the gaunt, iron-gray sharesman, stood erect,
split his fish viciously, and looked about him with scorn and
hatred. His heart was black with hate that night. He hated
Gershom with his gay boisterous laugh and booming voice because
he was monopolizing Fanny, and because Gershom was Fanny's
favourite. Too seldom he himself got Fanny's favours. He hated
the hoary Uriah, who goaded him to work without end, Joseph, spit
of his father, and the apple-faced Casper who gumbled at the
salting table. He despised the women because they made him matter
of jest. He hated David Jung, the new sharesman, because he was
Uriah's kinsman, and because in the boat that day he had dared to
laugh when the oar bobbed out and caught him between the eyes.
"I'll take it out on dat young bugger," he thought viciously.
Both his eyes were blackened, his nose swollen to twice its
normal size, and his evil temper was not sweetened by the fact
that Ruth nudged Tamar and giggled whenever she glanced his
way.</p>
<p>David, in obedience to a swift-flung order, stepped out into
the darkness to fetch buckets of water to replenish Joseph's
washing tubs. Noble Morash slipped out after him, barged against
him in the darkness, and upset him and his buckets over a tub of
rotten gurry. David groaned with pain and anger as the edge of
the tub caught him in the ribs, but by the time he had picked
himself up and found a stick, Noble Morash was back at his
splitting table gibbing herring, with a gleam of sardonic
pleasure in his sinister eyes. David dared not start a fight in
the fish house, so he filled his buckets with water, carried them
in, and emptied them in the washing tubs with never a word. But
he thought, "I'll bide my time, Noble Morash. Ye'll pay for that
push. I can't lick ye yet, but wait till I gits feed up an'
set."</p>
<p>A few mornings later, when Noble Morash pushed off his boat in
the dark and tried to hoist his sail, the halliards kept slipping
through his hands, and when day broke he found they had been
greased from end to end with the rottenest fish gurry, as his
nostrils had made him suspect on the first encounter. But it was
not until a year and a half later that David met his mortal foe,
one twilight, at the head of the launch, and engaged in deadly
combat to pay off a long score of cumulative insults. Had the
ubiquitous Uriah not caught sight of them as they rolled in a
death grapple under the logs of the launch, he would have been
short a sharesman on Rockbound, and that probably a gaunt and
black one.</p>
<p>Snip, snip went the fishing knives, splash fell the flung
entrails into the tubs, the swaying lanterns flickered wearily,
eyes drooped and backs sagged. It was midnight, though no one
dared look at watch or clock, and still huge piles of herring
gleamed on the floor. Even now some were soft and had to be flung
aside. Uriah would not work on the Lord's Day if anyone told him
the Lord's Day was come. There must be no talk of time.</p>
<p>"Speak us a piece, Gershom, speak us one ye made yur own
self," cried Joseph.</p>
<p>This was long before Gershom had made the ballad on Joseph in
which he referred to him as mud-rat Joe; that was the outcome of
a quarrel not yet born. Gershom was a great teller of tales and a
famous maker of ballads. Nothing loath, he began now in his great
voice to speak one he had made against Israel Slaughenwhite, at
the instigation of his cousin Dennis Born, who had been publicly
insulted by Israel. Gershom boasted that this ballad had become
so popular with the Outposters that it had driven Israel off the
island.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"O 'Lord above!' poor Israel cried,<br>
As he humbly knelt at Sophie's side,<br>
'O Lord! look down and hear my prayers,<br>
And cut off Gabe and all his heirs;<br>
And save the land old Jake has given<br>
To Tim and me and Liza Jim.'<br>
Again he prayed to His Majesty,<br>
'Oh, keep me safe on life's rough sea,<br>
And keep my loving Sophie pure,<br>
And guard her from the tempter's lure.'<br>
But a pair of horns for a marriage dot,<br>
Was the only answer Israel got.<br>
Again he prayed, he prayed in vain,<br>
He prayed like one who prays for rain,<br>
He prayed and prayed till his knees were sore,<br>
He prayed till he vowed he'd pray no more.<br>
He vowed that he no more would pray,<br>
Till Gabe and Jake was took away,<br>
And the land give back to him and Tim,<br>
And a deed of the house to Liza Jim.<br>
And then he'd pray with all his might,<br>
To the Lord who doeth all things right,<br>
But until his heavenly prayer was heard,<br>
In prayer no more he'd utter a word."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Uriah shook his head gravely, but enjoyed the slander just the
same.</p>
<p>"It's a gif', it's a gif," said the old king, his open left
eye twinkling. "Now, Gershom boy, if ye could only gib fish as
good as ye kin make verses, ye'd be a great sharesman."</p>
<p>Gershom laughed his great laugh. "I keeps my end up. I don't
try to pull an' haul my heart out like dat new David boy. I
enjoys life, I does," and he winked amorously at Fanny.</p>
<p>David listened to the ballad open mouthed. He knew all about
the Slaughenwhites and their fight with Dennis Born and had heard
the ballad chanted by the fishermen, but it became a new thing in
the mouth of the maker. It was astonishing to him that anyone
should have such learning and be able to string words together so
that they bobbed in time like the net corks on a gentle sea.
Young Gershom got his brains and gift from his father, old
Gershom Born, philosopher, wise man, and keeper of the Barren
Island Light.</p>
<p>"Young Gershom'll be a mighty man an' a wise one, too,"
thought David. "I'se'll stick close to him." He remembered now
that the folks on the Outposts said of old Gershom, "He's nigh
crazy, but wise. He sits out on de cliffs an' talks to de sea an'
de moonlight." Wise man, yes, he was! To him he owed his foothold
on Rockbound.</p>
<p>It was long after midnight, yet no one spoke of time. Joseph
and Noble Morash still lugged in barrows of herring, and dumped
them in slithering piles. Uriah told the story of the footless
nigger that haunted the field below Rockbound Light, of the
unseen force that had three times pushed him off the path into
the tall timothy, and when these tales failed to hold their
interest, tried to involve them in an argument about the
advantages of Rockbound as compared with the main. But no one
responded; even the blond Viking, Gershom Born, flagged. Joseph
still ran from salt bin to washing tubs, but he was silent as he
ran.</p>
<p>Then, in the midst of all this disorder and weariness of work
without end, when the flickering lanterns cast but a sickly light
on the oilskin-clad, blood-bespattered figures bent with fatigue
and glittered feebly on knives that flashed in and out and on the
hateful piles of fish that seemed never to diminish, in the midst
of all the dirt and confusion and stench, with an accompaniment
of the northeast night wind that hummed about the eaves and the
rhythmic mutter of the surf that alone was tireless, Fanny, the
potato girl, despised and rejected by the women of Rockbound,
Fanny, who slept in the loft with the sharesmen and who had the
morals of the birds, lifted up her voice and sang in a sweet,
clear treble:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"'There's a land that is fairer than day,<br>
And by faith we can see it afar;<br>
For the Father waits over the way<br>
To prepare us a dwelling place there.'"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>One by one the tired islanders joined in:</p>
<p>"In the sweet," sang Fanny.</p>
<p>"In the sweet," boomed Gershom Born's great bass.</p>
<p>"By and by," rang alto and soprano.</p>
<p>"By and by," answered bass and tenor.</p>
<p>"We shall meet on that beautiful shore."</p>
<p>All were in accord now and forgetting their weariness, except
Noble Morash, who scowled darkly about, and Casper, who thought,
"I don't want to meet on no <i>beautiful shore."</i> Like John on
the isle of Patmos, he sighed for a place where there should be
no sea.</p>
<p>David was too shy to sing at first, though he knew both tune
and words of the familiar hymn, but bending his head to escape
observation he made the words with his lips and swayed his head
in time with the others. But when Fanny came to:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"'To our bountiful Father above,<br>
We will render a tribute of praise,<br>
For the glorious gift of His love,<br>
And the blessings that hallow our days'"--</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>David, with an eye upon Ruth and Tamar, who might laugh at
him, joined in more boldly. As he sang he felt rested and
refreshed. Through to the end they carried the hymn, and then
repeated it over and over.</p>
<p>Some time after two, Uriah threw down his splitting knife.
"Put de res' in pickle. It mus' be gettin' on fur midnight; me
nor my fader before me ne'er worked on de Lord's Day, an' I won't
begin now. Put de res' in pickle an' all hands to bed, says
I."</p>
<p>Off they staggered, except David, who was ordered to remain
and help the tireless Joseph scoop heaps of unsplit herring into
pickle tubs. That last labour over, he, too, staggered along the
pathway to his house, where he threw himself on the kitchen couch
and pulled sacking over head and feet. For a moment, as he lay
there, he regretted that he had left the Outposts, a place of
poverty but comparative ease, for this hell of driving work; in
the next moment he was in a sleep like death.</p>

<p>The level sun streaming through the eastern window shone on
David's face, and the strange warmth woke him with a sudden
start. He was on his feet in a second; it was broad daylight; his
heart was in his boots, the Jung boats were long since near the
Rock. Then he remembered that it was Sunday and sat down with a
smile and a sigh of relief. "T'ank de Lord fur Sundays," he
muttered. He bestirred himself and built up the fire to make some
tea, but when Anapest saw his smoke she came to her kitchen door
and called: "Come ober, come ober, David."</p>
<p>"You'll be needin' some real food arter a day an' night like
dat," and she sat him down to a mountainous island of oatmeal
porridge in a sea of creamy milk. Anapest knew that Uriah was
trying to break with labour this boy who of necessity fed himself
badly, and she was moved to supply David with good food once in a
while, not only because of the goodness of her heart, but because
she wished to circumvent the old tyrant.</p>
<p>The Kraus boys, who had had no catch of herring, lounged
sullenly about the kitchen in their clean underclothes.</p>
<p>"How come Joe Jung come down from de eastern end yesterday?"
queried Christian Kraus.</p>
<p>"He were stakin' out his bull, I guess," answered David.</p>
<p>"An' de bull's staked on Cow Pasture Hill; I seed him dere
last evenin'. How come he runned from de eastern end wid de news
o' herrin'?"</p>
<p>"I don't keep no count o' Joseph's movements," said David,
squirming uneasily. He made up his mind that the Krauses would
not pump him.</p>
<p>"It's God damn queer, dat is," said Nicholas.</p>
<p>Joseph's ruse had not yet penetrated their thick heads, though
David felt they were perilously near a solution, and he resolved
to eat all he could before the Kraus boys put him out. The
porridge bowl pushed aside, he attacked a high pile of mellow
toast and washed down Anapest's scrambled eggs with three mugs of
hot coffee.</p>
<p>He rose from the table a new man, and with a humble, "T'ank
ye, Aunt Anapest, you'se de only frien' I got," went out quickly
before the Kraus boys could quiz him further. He recrossed the
fields, entered his own house, lay down again, and slept
intermittently till four in the afternoon, when he yawned,
stretched, yawned again, and then sat up really rested and
refreshed, with the wonderful resilience of youth.</p>
<p>He stripped, washed himself in his tin basin, and wished for
clean Sunday clothes such as other men put on. He had none and
had to take it out in wishing. Some day, he resolved, he would
acquire everything the others had and a great deal besides. He
was in good heart after his long sleep and Anapest's food, and
felt he could endure any task Uriah might put upon him.</p>
<p>He pulled on ragged trousers and frayed shirt and strolled out
in the warm afternoon air to walk around the back of the island.
He crossed the low bar, climbed the cliff, and on the cliff's
edge lay down on the thick matting of crowberry vines, through
which spikes of cranberries pushed their pink petals. From this
vantage point, he could look southward to the rim of the sea and
survey the panorama of broad bay, scattered islands, and the dim
headlands of the main. Though the ground swell smashed in at the
cliff's foot, the sea was comparatively calm, and he saw that the
herrings were still in the coves, for in the deeper water he
marked the swirl and splash of albacore that had followed the
fish. That meant that to-morrow would be another day of toil.
Well, let it come; at any rate, they would do no line fishing,
but shoot the seine soon after sunrise and get through most of
their gibbing by late afternoon or early evening.</p>
<p>From his rocky height he looked in leisurely fashion over the
rich kingdom of Rockbound, where, from land loaded with sea dung
and fish entrails, hay, potatoes, strawberries, and vegetables of
all kinds grew in profusion. The island, elliptical in shape, was
but a mile long and perhaps a half mile wide in its widest part,
and consisted of two rounded spruce-clad knolls, at eastern and
western ends, with a cleft between them. In the northern end of
this cleft or shallow valley stood the fish houses and dwellings
of Jungs and Krauses. Throughout the valley, from sea to sea,
were fields of rank timothy and rich garden plots of growing
potatoes and cabbages. Two of the hills on the western end had
been cleared and turned into hayfields, and named respectively
Crook's Hill and Wilson's Hill, after two old pioneers who had
broken their hearts in the clearing, and gone back to the
mainland bent old men defeated by cold, hardship, and the savage
sea. In rough weather, when winter seas broke on the southern
bar, spray and blown spume flew clear across the valley to the
northern shore. Always the sea snarled and gnawed at the bar.</p>
<p>"Some day," thought David, as he lay on the cliff's brink,
"she'll wash t'rough, an' den dere'll be two little islands in
place o' one, an' some day maybe she'll wash de whole t'ing away,
an' de chart'll be marked t'ree fadom, dangerous fur mariners."
Dimly he grappled for a moment with nature's fierce and
contemporary desire to create and destroy.</p>
<p>Far off to the eastward he could see the dark looming cliffs
of Metatogan, part of the main, to the north the masses of Big
and Little Outpost--Big Outpost shaped like a half-submerged
whale--and the blue ship channel between them on which the
afternoon sun glittered. By straining his eyes he could even
catch, through the gap of the Outposts, a dim flitting glimpse of
Friendly Island Light. To the westward were stretched out for him
Big and Little Duck, Flat Island, the Raggeds, and very dimly
Lubeck Island, marked by its pillar of white lighthouse. To the
southward was the flat sea, the only speck upon it Barren Island,
where old Gershom Born lived alone and kept the light. It was the
last outpost and, like Rockbound, a mass of upheaved, twisted
rock over which was spread a thin matting of turf and grass.</p>
<p>David wondered as he lay there what had made all these
islands--there were some three hundred of them scattered about
the bay--and why and how they had been made. Certainly they were
not perfectly made for fishing stands, since in the sea between
them were many treacherous shoals; even on this calm day the Bull
snorted to the eastward, the Grampus showed a bone in its teeth,
and the Rock sent up from time to time a curtain of white spray.
Only last September, Ed Swim and Morehouse Young had run their
boat over the Grampus in a fog, swamped her, and lost their
lives. He had heard of the omnipotent God who created the world
and punished those who disobeyed His laws. Why had he not made
the world a perfect, happy place? he wondered. For it was not
perfect, and he could not get the idea out of his head that
dreaded shoals had once been green islands, and that these
islands now around him would one day be ugly reefs, cutting the
top off the breakers.</p>
<p>He was vaguely conscious of a force beating beneath him,
perhaps the rhythmic impulse of the sea at the cliff's foot, and
of the unending restlessness of the sea. It seemed to him that
God and the devil were in a gigantic struggle, the one building
up islands and continents for men to live on, the other
personified by the sea, growling, roaring, and gnawing away what
God had made. He had heard the old men tell how much the sea had
encroached on the islands in their lifetimes. Yes, the devil was
in the sea destroying islands and mainland. Sometimes he seemed
asleep on a sunny, windless day, but you had to watch him, for he
sprang at you treacherously out of a fog bank, or in a dead calm
sent a sudden roller against you to swamp your boat, low down
with fish. And the devil seemed stronger than God! How could that
be? He must ask old Gershom Born.</p>
<p>Were the islands made, he wondered, when the sea washed away
soft parts of the main, or had they popped up suddenly from the
sea floor expelled by some earth force? Certainly all the twisted
cliffs around him that now stood slanting and on end looked as if
they had been once laid down in flat layers. If the rocks had
popped up from the sea floor, how had trees and flowers and grass
got on the islands? Perhaps the sea wind had blown some fine sand
dust into a rock crevice, and into this a sea bird had by
accident dropped a seed, or perhaps a high wind had blown seeds
from the main. He had often seen thistledown twirling its light
parachute far out at sea. Then a plant had grown and spread its
seeds and rooted, and more plants had grown, and fine sand had
tangled in their roots. But what a long time it must have taken
to make even as much soil as there was on Rockbound! Ages and
ages! Jennie Run-over, when maudlin with drink, had sometimes
talked to him of God, the great lover of men. Why, he wondered,
if men were His children and He truly loved them, had He made
things so rough and hard? Why had He made sharks, dogfish and
albacore, which played havoc with the nets, and in one night
sometimes destroyed more than a man could earn in a month? Why
didn't he stop that treacherous devil in the sea that sent stout
boats to the bottom and forever ate up the land He had made? On
the Outposts were many widows whose little children ran wild,
ill-clad, and half fed. Why was the God-fearing Uriah so
grasping, and why did the Rockbound Jungs kill themselves with
labour to get money when they had plenty already? He knew why he
wanted money: to repair and paint his house, to get himself some
clothes and gear, to buy himself a fast, stout boat, every timber
his very own--Ezra Goudy, the best builder in all the islands,
should make her--to buy some day a fiddle and learn to play jigs
on it like Cutter Westhaver, and above all to escape slavery. For
he realized that he had always been a slave, and that he was
still a slave, driven to and fro at every man's beck and call.
Wait till he got some money! Perhaps he could some day build his
own launch and fish from his own fish house.</p>
<p>So he lay on the matting of soft crowberry and dreamed and
rested, thanking the good God for the Sabbath, till the sun's
disk touched the rim of the Ragged Island cliffs and twilight
came softly, and the light on Barren Island began to wink. Old
Gershom Born had trimmed and lighted his lamp, and it repeated
over and over: five seconds flash, five seconds occult, five
seconds flash, five seconds occult, twenty-one seconds flash,
nineteen seconds occult, saying to mariners on the high seas: "I
am Barren Island Light. I warn you from the Rock, the Grampus,
and the Bull. Keep well to the eastward of me if you want to make
Minden by the inside passage, or well to the westward of me if
you want the ship's channel between the Outposts to Duren Bay.
After you leave me, you will pick up the fixed lights on
Rockbound and Friendly that will guide you to safety."</p>
<p>It seemed to David that the light was marking off time; a
complete revolution meant a minute. "There's another minute
gone," he thought, "and how am I changed, or how am I better off
than I was a minute ago? I am one minute nearer to being dead,
and I am still Uriah's sharesman." Time never stood still, but
flowed by him like the tide through sou'west gutter. Only the
tide ebbed and flowed, while time had always flowed from
somewhere in one direction, and its flood made into a limitless
future. It was like space, bigger than the sea, stretching out in
all directions without limits. Could the world be round? The
coloured man on the banker, who taught him to steer, had told him
so. But how could water stick to a round ball, and why didn't it
drop off the under side? Certainly it looked flat enough, though
when he thought a while he remembered that on clear days he had
seen the upper spars of vessels that were still hull down. Yes,
there must be some curve even to the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>When the stars peeped out, David lay on his back and looked on
them. He had lived so much alone that he had learned to look and
wonder. He marvelled at their multitude as the night grew darker,
and saw that some twinkled and some shone copper red. Stars were
useful things to steer a vessel by: you could hold one star on
the rigging and keep her on her course, and without north star
and dipper fishermen would fare badly. God must have stuck them
in the sky, but surely there wasn't any need for so many stars to
light the earth, especially those sprinkled like sifted flour
across the middle belt of the heavens.</p>
<p>Day birds that had wheeled round his height--he knew them all
from the great gannet to the flitting checkerback--now settled on
rock or wave and their places were taken by carey and nighthawk,
island birds of the darkness. After a while he stirred, stretched
himself, and started homeward, rested, refreshed, and braced for
the morrow's work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The herring stayed on the shore for three weeks. Never had the
Rockbounders made such a catch; every puncheon in the fish house
was heaped up, and Uriah insisted on filling as well two old
whalers and a dory that, when soaked up for a day in the sea,
were still tight enough to hold pickle. In the last ten days of
the herrings' stay, the old king ruled that the hay must be got.
Uriah cut fifty tons in the rich valley and upland fields, which
he loaded down in October with fish heads, entrails, and rotted
kelp. Every morning of those last ten days Joseph, Martin, young
Gershom, and David shot the seine and encircled a school of
herring, while Casper and Noble Morash drove ringing scythes into
the tall, overripe timothy, already becoming a little woody in
the stem. By noon, when the fishermen were in with deep-laden
boats, the farmers had made work enough for them. The women
turned the hay and raked it up in windrows; the men gibbed fish
till four in the afternoon and then rushed to the fields to haul
in five or six great oxloads of hay, cut the day before. Time was
precious, for the fog bank usually rolled in before seven.
Everyone drove and hustled everyone else; everything was done in
a rush. In a rush the hay was pitched on the carts, in a rush it
was pitched off and stowed in the mows. Uriah, the general, was
everywhere. Hay must go in, come sunshine or fog, though it
steamed and heated in the mows, for it was within the range of
possibility that a summer month might go by on Rockbound without
a drying sun. Old Gershom Born used to say that he had seen Uriah
and his sons making hay in their oilskins. One terrible
afternoon, after a heavy catch of herring, they hauled in seven
loads on the creaking wains and stowed them in the old man's
barn. After a hasty snack of supper that night, men and women
were back in the fish house, gibbing furiously in the swaying
light of the dim lanterns.</p>
<p>David, almost broken with toil, prayed to the Lord who sent
the Sabbath and gave the guiding stars that the herring fishing
might stop so that he might take the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> on the
banks and again be his own master. When the hay was almost
garnered, his prayer was answered: a summer storm came with big
rollers, and the herring were driven off into deep water. Even
the giant sons of Uriah heaved sighs of relief, but Uriah, who
could not bear the thought of letting anything escape him,
grumbled at their lack of industry, though every puncheon, dory,
and spare boat was piled high with salted fish. Had all the fish
in the sea been laid on the floor of his fish house, he would
have been still unsatisfied, but would have set about praying the
Lord to create more so that his sons might catch them.</p>

<p>When David was twenty-four and had been six years on
Rockbound, he was still Uriah's sharesman. Things had changed but
little. Age had not withered Uriah, who was as active and driving
as ever. True, his legs had weakened a little each year, and
bowed a little further outward at the knees, but when he sat on
his box to slit open herring or mackerel, his hands flew as fast
as ever. Every night, as the sun touched the western horizon, he
trudged, come sunshine, fog, or snow, to light the fixed light on
the cliffs of Rockbound, and he was never happier than when he
sat down to mend net or seine, torn and tangled by dogfish or
albacore. He kept all the gear in repair for the boys. He was too
old to go fishing. "De boat rutches my legs too much," he used to
say. Every year his bank account had grown, and as he moved the
livelong day from one labour to another he derived enormous
pleasure from meditating upon his wealth. The tenant in Liscomb
had given him endless trouble, but at last, to quiet her clacking
tongue and stop her letters, he had allowed her a toilet off the
kitchen.</p>
<p>Joseph still ran from barrow to barrow and aided and abetted
his father in hustling the sharesmen, and Casper still grumbled
and grunted anticlerical argument at the salting table. Fanny,
the potato girl, as pretty as ever, still whistled blithely over
her cabbages and potatoes, still raised the hymns in the fish
house of a heavy evening, and still served the needs of the great
sharesmen in the loft. Even David had plucked up courage to
invite her to walk with him on the back of the island, where they
reclined on the crowberry vines and in the shelter of a thick
screen of spruces watched old Gershom Born's light blink out the
hours.</p>
<p>Old Simeon was dead at last, but he had nodded his foolish
head and gibbed in the fish house on the very day of his death.
Noble Morash, too, the gaunt black sharesman, David's enemy, was
gone. Uriah had sent him to the Sand Cove to fetch dory loads of
rockweed and kelp, which the islanders call sea dung. Having met
with reproof from the old king for the smallness of a previous
load, he had forked on to this last load he was to carry three
forkfuls too much. A breaking wave swamped him as he rounded West
Head; his dory turned over and threw him into the sea. He could
not swim, as is the case with most of the islanders, and had
clawed with numbed fingers at the smooth bottom of the upturned
dory, till the icy water chilled him to the bone. He was lying
stretched out on the sea floor, and curious fish were sniffing at
him and peering into his staring eyes long before the boats that
set out from the launch could reach him.</p>
<p>Young Gershom was as jocose, as noisy, and as full of talk as
ever. He was merely biding his time with Uriah on Rockbound till
he could inherit Barren Island Light from old Gershom. He had
become David's inseparable friend and had taught the boy all the
wickedness he knew. Gershom, an epicurean by nature, believed in
wine and love as a relief from labour; his wine being the black
rum smuggled in by St. Pierre runners, his love, affairs with any
stout fisher lasses he could pick up on the islands. "Boy," he
used to say to David as they fished near each other on the banks,
"I'm savin' up my money, an' in October I'se goin' to de main to
have two weeks of sinful pleasure." As he was courageous, strong
as a lion, generous with his friends, and daringly rude to his
enemies, a famous wit and story-teller, a great lover and
drinker, he was welcome everywhere.</p>
<p>Though it was true that David was still a sharesman, he had
advanced, for all that. Joseph had paid him a monthly share,
though it was not his true monthly share, as David right well
knew. He owned a boat, a stout fast clipper equipped with a
gasoline engine. Uriah had at first derided the engine, things
that he and his brother Simeon had never had, but gradually all
the Jung boys had come to them; now even at the head of the
launch was a stationary engine, with drum and wire cable for
hauling out the boats. The slow-footed oxen had been superseded
for that function, though they still dragged the plough, sagged
in the great loads of hay, hauled the tubs of gurry to the autumn
fields, and twitched logs in winter. David had a Sunday suit,
four changes of woollen underwear, overalls, rubber boots,
oilskins, sou'westers, cotton gloves, and nippers. His house he
had painted, reshingled, and repaired throughout; even the
upstairs rooms were finished and plastered. He owned four fleets
of herring nets now, and a half-dozen tubs of trawl, a
long-barrelled duck gun--he was the best shot on the island, with
Gershom a close second--and last of all he had paid Selmar Strum,
the cunning workman of Hermann's Island, twenty-five dollars to
make him a fiddle.</p>
<p>The bottom of maple was made of a piece of hand-hewn beam that
Great-grandfather Strum had put into his barn somewhere about
1760, soon after the old folks had come across the seas from
Oldenburg; the top was of old, well-seasoned, wide-grained
spruce, the tailpiece and string-board a cunningly inlaid strip
of swordfish spike, while the scroll was carved in the shape of a
leaping pollock. David loved to handle it and to stroke the
curves of the smooth, satiny wood; already he had learned to play
a few tunes on it.</p>
<p>In his six years on the island his friendship for Gershom had
steadily grown. Now he went everywhere with the blue-eyed giant,
who, though ten years older than he, was a dashing and lively
companion. They pushed their boats off the launch at the same
moment and fished on the same bank; sometimes Gershom was late of
a morning, and if David, urged on by Uriah's taunts and jibes,
was obliged to push off first, he jogged his boat and waited for
Gershom to the southward of the Grampus. At lunch time on the
bank, they lashed their boats together and laughed and talked as
they ate their bread and cakes. In this piece of comradeship,
however, they were often interrupted, for David was such a lucky
fisherman and had established such a reputation for uncanny
knowledge of the whereabouts of cod that he had become the fish
pilot for the fleet, and when the flash of fish over his gunwale
was seen in far-off boats, Jungs and Krauses, aye, and fishermen
from the other islands, circled his selected bank.</p>
<p>In late October of each year, after the last school of
mackerel had gone south, the cod dried and the herring barrelled
and sold, Uriah, in accordance with the fisherman's custom, had
perforce to grant David and Gershom a fortnight's holiday. This
they always spent with the Boutiliers, distant cousins of
Gershom's, at Miscou, on St. Michael's Bay. Boutilier, himself a
huge man, was a great lover of dancing, fighting, and drinking,
and a fit companion for the sanguine Gershom and his disciple.
Nearly every night they drove long distances to some country hall
where a dance was in progress, kissed the pretty girls in dark
corners, got very drunk, and fought with the local bucks.</p>
<p>At one such dance, where red-faced fishermen twirled their
broad-hipped partners, David, flushed and arrogant with rum,
insisted on taking the violin from the local fiddler and playing
Outpost jigs and some strange airs he had learned from the sea.
He swayed the dancers first to one mood and then to another, and
won such applause that the established fiddler, Pierre Comeau, a
strong man who could do more than fiddle, for he was a blacksmith
by trade, challenged him to fight on the grass outside. A couple
of lanterns were fetched, and out flocked men and women to see
the contest. David fared none too well and carried home two
blackened eyes, for Pierre Comeau was nearly sober and he half
drunk; the fishermen stopped the fight after a few rounds, lest
the artists should hurt their hands and thus make an end of the
dancing. To eat heartily at leisure, to be drunk and go to a
dance every night, to have numerous fist fights, to lie in bed
late of a morning, seemed to Gershom and David the substance of
an ideal holiday after the fever of work on Rockbound. Here, on
the main with the Boutiliers, there was no hypocrisy of virtuous
pretence, no one thought much about money or strove for stars in
some far-off crown.</p>
<p>When they laboured on the island, Gershom and David always
spent Sundays together. Sometimes they explored the Raggeds to
pick up some lobsters or scallops out of season, sometimes they
took boat, visited the Outposts and hung about Jennie Run-over's
place. Jennie, the buxom one, was just as hearty as when she had
picked up the gaffer David staring with homesick eyes toward
Rockbound. There they learned all the local news and gossip of
the islands, for Jennie's place was a kind of clearing house for
such stuff, and met the Outpost girls, who liked to slake their
thirst on Jennie's foaming black beer.</p>
<p>David had become Gershom's apt pupil; already Molly Biddle of
Big Outpost attributed a love child to him, and though David was
none too sure of the parentage, he ungrudgingly paid her a
monthly dole. Gershom, in a playful mood, used to gird at him
with, "Dat kid's de livin' image o' you, Dave, but how come de
red hair?" But now, as well, he had a serious affair on his
hands: he was paying court to Leah Levy, old Nathan Levy's
daughter. Nathan Levy was reputed to have eight thousand dollars
in the bank, and owned two hundred acres of good land on Little
Outpost. Most of his money would go to Leah, as his boys were all
married and established. With the reputation of being the best
fisherman in the bay, David was an acceptable suitor for any
man's daughter. His peccadilloes in Miscou and the Outposts
counted as naught against him with the islanders. Leah was
comely, with her black hair, oval face, and olive complexion, and
while David was not deeply in love with her, he figured that she
would make a good wife and a means of pulling himself up in the
world. She attracted him more than other island girls, for while
she repulsed his advances she looked on him with favour and would
not apparently disapprove an offer of marriage. However,
something unexpected happened, which upset all of David's
calculations.</p>
<p>Tamar Jung, Uriah's daughter, a young woman in her twenties,
began to cast eyes upon David and to follow him about. For years
he had seen her in field and fish house, but she had never
attracted him, because she had Joseph's big nose and aggressive
jaw. She was red-faced, strong, and healthy, and could take one
end of a loaded fish barrow from boat to fish house when a man
was missing, or pitch on hay over the high racks as fast as
anyone on the island. Wherever he went in the fish house or loft
she was at his heels, once she followed him into the salt bin and
rubbed against him like a playful kitten. The wily Gershom,
skilled in the ways of women, observed all this and one day said
to David: "Dat Tamar's stuck on you, boy; don't miss a chance
like dat."</p>
<p>So David walked with Tamar in the woods of summer nights. She
wanted him badly for a husband, but, in lieu of that, she would
take him for a lover. David was not in the least in love with
her; he preferred Leah Levy's dark face and soft voice. Still,
Tamar was affectionate in a rough way and a great worker; she
would inherit some of Uriah's money and make a useful partner for
a fisherman. In fact, David was rather sick of the sharesman's
loft where he had slept for the last two years, first because of
his desire to be always near young Gershom, and second because
there he was sure to be called by Uriah and get his boat off
among the first. Once he had overslept in his own house. Lately
there had been bedbugs in the loft, though to the credit of
Uriah's wife and the girls they did not last long after their
discovery, and Frank Richardson, the new sharesman, befouled the
air with his obscene noises. Yes, David was pretty sick of the
sharesman's loft and half wanted a wife, to complete the house he
had painted and repaired. Still, he had no intent of marrying
Tamar or even Leah Levy just now; he meant to keep himself free
for a few more years, save some money, and indulge in his annual
riot with Gershom and Jean Boutilier in Miscou.</p>
<p>It was one night in early September, when they were beginning
to lay the split cod to dry on the ledgy rocks of Sou'west Cove,
that Uriah said to David, "Come wid, I wants to talk wid you." In
silence he led him to the middle of the timothy field, now rank
with second growth, on Crook's Hill. There Uriah turned on David
fiercely:</p>
<p>"What you mean ruinin' my gal?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know as how she were."</p>
<p>"Well, she is, an' what does ye mean?"</p>
<p>David said nothing.</p>
<p>"You'se come sneakin' out to dis island what me an' my fader
made, an' now you goes an' knocks up Tamar. What does you
mean?"</p>
<p>"I don't mean nuttin'; I didn't go fur to do it: it's only
natural."</p>
<p>"Natural, is it! Well, you got to marry her now, an' here's
one o' Nicolaus Kaulbach's boys bin a-wantin' her dis two year,
him what owns a fish stand an' forty acres o' good ground on
Little Outpost."</p>
<p>"Let Nick Kaulbach's boy have her, den."</p>
<p>"What foolishness you talk, he won't marry her now," screamed
Uriah.</p>
<p>"I s'pose not; I s'pose he wouldn't like to have a woman
carryin' anoder man's baby."</p>
<p>"You s'pose right. You got dat t'rough yur t'ick head, has ye?
Now, listen to me, boy, you'se got to marry her."</p>
<p>"I don't want to marry no one. I'se'll pay fur de doctor an'
de keep o' de kid."</p>
<p>"We don't have no bastard in de Jung family. De Krauses is
full o' bastards, but dere ain't none from my gals," shouted
Uriah in a voice that might be heard over half the island. "You
got to marry her."</p>
<p>"I'se not makin' money 'nuff yet fur to keep a wife on."</p>
<p>"Ye'd make more if ye worked harder."</p>
<p>Then a wonderful idea flashed through David's brain.</p>
<p>"I tells you what," said he. "I'se tired o' bein' a sharesman.
I bin sharesman now fur six year, an' I'se ketched more fish than
air Joe, Martin, or Casper. I'se got to git on in de worl' same
as you an' yer fader did afore ye. I'se a Jung an' de same blood
as you. If ye takes me into de firm on an even divvy, I'se'll
marry Tamar."</p>
<p>"What!" screamed Uriah, purple with rage at David's arrogance.
"You come here a beggar an' now ye wants in my firm what me an'
my fader made. You certainly got de gall."</p>
<p>"Take me in de firm if ye wants me to marry Tamar, or raise a
Jung bastard," repeated David stubbornly.</p>
<p>"Dat I won't," shouted Uriah, "an' ye kin get off dis island.
Ye can't stay sharesman wid me."</p>
<p>"Maybe I won't stay sharesman wid you, but I won't git off dis
island. Maybe ye don't know Anapest sold me a strip o' waterfront
abreast her fish house. Dere I'se'll build me my own launch an'
fish house an' hire my own sharesmen in time to come. Dere's many
an able lad on de Outposts ready an' willin' to fish wid me, as
ye right well knows."</p>
<p>Uriah gasped, and his empurpled face swelled as if he were
about to suffer an apoplectic stroke. Why could this beggar, once
a landless waif, always defy him? He had got the best of everyone
else and imposed his will on them. He hated David with a deep,
bitter hatred as he stood there, and would have given half his
wealth to destroy him. To dispossess him, he had tried all his
wiles: he had tried to break him when a boy by heavy and unwonted
labour; he had even hired Martin to roll beach rocks along his
hallway and to play ghost round his house at midnight, in the
hope of scaring him away. All to no avail, and even a money loss,
for Martin, on his last ghosting expedition, had got three
buckshot in the calf of his leg that necessitated a secret visit
to the doctor in Minden and an expenditure of ten dollars. How
did this boy dare to defy him, king of Rockbound, and what could
he do? Nicolaus Kaulbach would never let his boy marry Tamar now.
He saw he could do nothing but give way and make the best of a
sorry bargain.</p>
<p>"I'se'll t'ink it ober," said Uriah savagely.</p>
<p>"You t'ink it ober. I don't wish Tamar no harm; she's a good
girl, but she ain't de woman fur me. You t'ink it ober; if ye
wants Tamar married, ye takes me into de firm on an even
divvy."</p>
<p>"I'se'll tell ye what I'se'll do right now," said Uriah.</p>
<p>"Let's hear ye den."</p>
<p>"I'se'll take ye into de firm on de line fish an' herrin', but
ye'll go sharesman on de mackerel."</p>
<p>"Why on de mackerel?"</p>
<p>"'Cause ye ain't got no mackerel gear."</p>
<p>"I'se'll t'ink it ober."</p>
<p>"No, ye says right now. Dere ain't no time fur delays. If
you'se goin' to marry Tamar it's got to be right off. Den we kin
spread de word 'twere a seben mont's' child."</p>
<p>David thought for a dubious moment, chewing a straw of
timothy.</p>
<p>"All right, I'se'll take yer lay: an equal divvy on herrin'
an' line fish an' sharesman on de mackerel. How about lobsters,
old man?"</p>
<p>"Sharesman on lobsters, too."</p>
<p>"No," said David, "lobsterin' hard, heavy, an' dangerous work.
I won't go dat lay; I wants my own lobsters."</p>
<p>"Den keep yur own lobsters what ye ketches in yur own traps
what ye make wid yur own hands. What kind o' man is ye, anyhow?
First ye knocks up my gal, an' den, instead o' bein' sorry an'
repentant, ye drives a hard bargain over it. Ain't ye
ashamed?"</p>
<p>"I'se a man what stands up fur my rights an' tears away what I
kin git from people like ye in de world. Didn't ye try fur to
keep me off dis island an' part o' it mine by right?"</p>
<p>"De island's mine by right an' would 'a' bin, too, if ye an'
Anapest hadn't come sneakin' back on it. Me an' my fader made dis
island what it is, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"An' my grandfader, he made it, too."</p>
<p>"Well, it's no good arguin' wid a t'ickhead like you. Is it a
bargain, does ye marry Tamar?"</p>
<p>"I does if I gits a divvy on all but de mackerel."</p>
<p>"It's a bargain," said Uriah.</p>
<p>The old man and the young man stood there in the twilight,
looking straight into each other's eyes, each busied with his own
thoughts. A bargain was a bargain, both knew, and though there
was no written agreement, for neither could read or write, the
contract was sure and binding.</p>
<p>Uriah, full of wiles, cunning, and double dealing before a
bargain, would stick to anything he had directly affirmed. His
life amid hardship and danger had made that part of the moral
code essential. His morals were purely matters of utility, since
he knew that nothing could be accomplished unless men held to
their contracts. In the boy, Uriah caught a glimpse of the hard
battles and conquests of his own youth, and felt with a twinge of
regret that David was a better man than any of his sons. The old
man's heart was in a fury because he had been beaten, but he
concealed his rage. David turned over in his mind in that short
moment what he could get out of the bargain. Joseph, the keeper
of the money box, would, of course, still cheat him, but, at any
rate, he would get twice as much as he had received as sharesman.
Tamar had some learning, she could read, write, and figure, and
could make a useful check on Joseph by keeping account of the
catch from day to day.</p>
<p>Uriah fetched Mr. Snow the Baptist minister from Sanford, and
David and Tamar were married without delay in Uriah's big
kitchen. They stood in front of the cooking stove with a
background of shining pots and pans. David did not feel right in
his heart, and mumbled the responses, but Tamar spoke loud and
clear, for she had won the man of her heart. None of the Jung
brothers was present, but their wives and children, egged on by
curiosity, were ranged around the walls on the kitchen chairs. It
was a rather gloomy ceremony. Uriah, to uphold the honour of the
Jung family, and to conceal the fact that it was a forced
marriage, tried to assume a gay and playful attitude and told
several stories of how he had courted his wife on Little Outpost.
Even the supper and hot rum punch did not thaw the hearts of
Martin's and Joseph's wives, who glowered reproachfully at bride
and bridegroom. They had heard nothing but wrath and invective
over this affair from their husbands, and they faithfully
reflected their attitude. Soon after ten the wedding party broke
up, and David took home to his house the woman he did not
love.</p>
<p>But David soon found that he had made no bad bargain.
Rockbound women study how to be of use to their husbands. They
work, for there is no one to hire to do the work that somehow is
naturally expected of them and which seems right and proper to
themselves. They rear their children, tend their houses, milk
cows, feed chickens, hoe the gardens, help with the hay, and when
necessary give a hand in the fish house. It is no uncommon sight
to see a couple of babies sleeping in an old sail on top of the
fish puncheons as the mothers split fish. But in addition to this
work they are always watching from the windows. As they go from
duty to duty, they peer from kitchen window, from front-room
window, from upstairs windows for the boats. Trust them, they
know every boat, every patch upon the brown sails, the peculiar
chug of every engine, the curve of each stem, the sheer, the
strip of colour beneath the gunwale. Each watches for the return
of her man. Far off they see his boat coming from the Rock and
know from its depth whether he has had a good catch or not. If
his boat is light and fish pens empty, he may be angry and
discontented. As in all conditions of life, where men daily face
death and danger, the women occupy a secondary position and
subordinate themselves to the men. They watch for the boats so
that the potatoes may be boiled and the stew steaming hot, the
biscuits baked, dry socks and boots laid out, at the exact moment
when the boat's prow takes the first log on the launch.</p>
<p>David enjoyed life with Tamar and grew fonder of her as the
days went by; for the first time he lived in comparative comfort.
It was great to get in from the boats and find a steaming hot
dinner, to have a clean decent lunch of bread and cakes wrapped
in a white cloth and packed in a tin box to take to the banks, to
have fresh, clean sheets on the bed, to find clean underclothes
warming by the kitchen fire of a Sunday morning, to have socks
mended, sea boots warmed and dried, and oilskins hung on their
proper pegs in the kitchen. "Yes," he thought, "I'se made none so
bad a bargain, arter all."</p>
<p>He was proud of being in the Jung firm, and could bear with
lightness of heart the ugly glances and spiteful words of Casper,
Martin, and Joseph. They stuck together against him since the
wedding, though each month they squabbled among themselves over
the division of the money. They tried to make David feel that
even as a partner he was an outsider and hence inferior. He bore
with them patiently, but on one occasion, after a heavy day in
the fish house, when they were all weary and irritated, he let
out at them. As he was carrying a bushel of salt from bin to
salting table, he bumped against Joseph and spilled a handful of
salt down his rubber boot. Joseph turned on him with a snarl:
"What ye do dat fur, ye clumsy Outposter? Ye don't belong here
nohow. All de world knows how ye wormed yur way into de family."
Whereupon, in the presence of the sharesmen, David struck his
partner in the face with a flung haddock and knocked him over his
washing tubs. David and Gershom drew closer together. There was
no envy in Gershom; he disliked the arrogant brothers and gloried
in David's good fortune.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>One night some two months after the wedding, as David sat
drying his stockings by the kitchen stove, he heard shouting on
the pathway that led up to his house. He listened; it was
Gershom's booming voice, trembling with excitement: "De light's
out on Barren Island, de light's out on Barren Island!" David
strode quickly to the kitchen door, Gershom joined him, and both
stared across the bar to the southward. It was true, no light
twinkled against southern sky, nor cast its yellow ray over black
sea. Some disaster had befallen old Gershom; perhaps he had
slipped over the cliff wall, or a sea had dashed him against the
rocks and broken his legs. Both knew what must be done without
delay, and David turned back to the kitchen to pull on rubber
boots and oilskins. "De light's out on Barren Island. Me an'
Gershom's goin' off. Should be back by daybreak," he called to
Tamar, who, after the manner of Rockbound wives, made no protest
and offered no suggestion.</p>
<p>David and young Gershom ran a boat off the launch, rounded the
Grampus, and through darkness and a long-running sea drove hard
to the southward. Though there was no fog, it was a murky night,
and only the great stars blinked dimly in the black bowl of sky.
In an hour the draught of southeast wind brought to their ears
the boom and roar of Barren Island surf, and they began to feel
their way in cautiously, since nothing marked the rock-cleft
landing place save a line of black in a curve of breaking white,
and that, on such a night, they could only discern when close in.
They shipped a sea over their stern, but made the launch,
clambered to safety, and hove out their boat. As their feet
fumbled for the pathway that led across the sombre island, careys
swooped and squawked about their ears. Gershom, hooking his great
arm through David's, said: "I wisht we'd brung air a draught o'
rum wid, Dave."</p>
<p>The lighthouse towered dark and silent, the south wind
strumming an unearthly melody on its supporting wires. The two
friends entered the kitchen and, with the quick spurt and flare
of David's match, both started in horror. The table was
overturned, and on the floor lay the old man, dead, a
half-emptied rum jug beside him. His dog, cowering behind the
stove, bared his teeth and growled at the intruders. "Looks like
he'd had an awful struggle wid a haunt 'fore he died," said young
Gershom, trembling with grief and terror.</p>
<p>They lit the lamp in the light tower, stood watches throughout
the night, and with the first gray of dawn carried the old man's
body to their boat, the dog snapping and snarling at their
heels.</p>
<p>Old Gershom was buried on Big Outpost one bleak November
afternoon, and young Gershom was drunk at his funeral, for,
sober, he could not bear to see the old man he loved and feared
laid underground. With David he stood at the grave's head, his
great body shaken with sobs, the tears making clean channels down
his salt-stained cheeks. There was many a wet eye, too, among
fisherfolk who claimed no kinship. Old Gershom had been great
hearted. To whom could they now turn for the writing of deeds,
wills, and mortgages, or for advice on the cunning of fish
dealers or the sharp tricks of Liscomb lawyers? "Old Gershom Born
will be missed in the islands," they said to one another sadly.
"Young Gershom is a bold strong man, but he lacks the wisdom of
his father."</p>
<p>Young Gershom, who had waited many years to succeed his father
as keeper of the light, was given the post. Uriah, who on the
event of old Gershom's death had applied secretly for the place
for one of his boys, was full of envy, for the keeper got eighty
dollars a month, besides fuel and lodging, and that was great
wealth in the islands. The old king also resented losing Gershom
as a sharesman; it would be hard to replace the young giant in
the fish house.</p>
<p>As for Gershom, now that he was appointed, he dreaded going to
Barren Island alone. He thought of marrying Fanny, the potato
girl, but his pride held him back; some wit on the Outposts would
surely make him the subject of jest and scorn in a ballad, and
that Gershom could not endure. Finally he besought his friend
David to come with him and spend his two weeks' holiday on Barren
Island. "Till I gits used to de place and masters some o' dem
haunts," pleaded Gershom. Now, David had planned an epic holiday
with Jean Boutilier at Miscou, but in the face of his friend's
obvious distress he agreed to go with him, if Uriah would give
his consent. Gershom broached the subject to the old king, who
cunningly turned the matter over in his mind. He was envious of
Gershom but not without a certain pity for him. It was terrible
for a man to go to Barren Island alone. He knew more about haunts
than any man in the whole bay, had he not seen the footless
nigger flit a score of times, had he not thrice been pushed off
his path by an unseen force! And Rockbound haunts were mild,
compared with those of Barren Island! Yes, it was a fearsome
place to go alone! "De cod's made," Uriah thought, "de green fish
an' herrin's sold. Nuttin' to do now but peddle de cabbages along
de shore from Dover to Liscomb, an' Dave's no good at sellin'.
Martin an' Joe's de boys to drive bargains an' git de last cent.
Bes' keep friendly wid de keeper o' de first light." Aloud he
said to Gershom: "I kin ill spare David now, but I'se'll let him
go wid as a favour, providin' ye'll agree to make a smoke when
wreckage goes floatin' by or ye hears air a word of a ship
ashore. An' you, David, be back on de day set widout fail."</p>
<p>So, one morning in late November, David set off with Gershom
to install him as keeper of the Barren Island Light. They landed
at midday and relieved the temporary keeper, who was glad to be
gone. The island was an eerie place, for one heard naught by day
or night but the tiresome beat of surf, the moan of the sea wind,
and the shrill screams of gulls and careys. Though David was an
agnostic in regard to ghosts, he could not deny that there was
something queer and unearthly about Barren Island. Even the
government engineer--so ran the tale--who had built the light's
foundation, had reported to the islanders that things were not as
they should be. As the friends stepped out of the lighthouse one
blowy night soon after their arrival, to make the round of the
cliffs, Gershom gripped David's arm and said: "Listen!" From the
northern end a hoarse, distant voice seemed to cry: "Help! Ahoy,
there, ahoy!" and from below the cliff wall came sounds like the
rattling of oars and the banging of a shattered boat, but when
they reached the cliff's edge they could see or hear nothing.
After nightfall they kept close together, for both knew that the
old man's haunt would linger about the island for a little
while.</p>
<p>Apart from ghosts, the bareness of the island depressed David;
there was neither garden plot nor mowing field nor single bush or
tree. Old Gershom had tried to raise vegetables in his early days
on the island, but the roaring sea had flung too much salt spray
upon his land. Even the coarse grasses were yellow and stunted.
David claimed that the island had once been larger and wooded,
for, on the slack of spring tides, his sharp eyes, peering
through green water to the yellow sands below, had seen gnarled
stumps of pine and maple, preserved through the centuries by sea
water and perhaps half turned to stone. The bareness of the place
was accentuated by the buildings: the stiff white lighthouse
stayed with cables to support its crystal head, the tiny barn,
the fuel shed, the outhouse weighed down with slabs of stone on
the southern end, and on the northern end the long boathouse that
stood above the cleft blasted through the cliff wall by
government engineers for a landing stage.</p>
<p>Now that Barren Island was to be Gershom's home, the two
friends explored it thoroughly. It was only seven hundred yards
long and perhaps four hundred wide; nothing but a slatty rock
protruding from the sea, over which was laid a mat of soil and
turf varying from one foot to five in depth. At the light's foot,
a great stone block, a natural pier, stood out boldly and defied
the open sea. No ship ever warped up to that pier, for on the
calmest days of summer a tireless ground swell broke there, and
in winter mountainous seas lashed it without rest. Above this
natural pier was a slippery plateau inclined at a slight angle to
the sea's surface. The impetuous winter sea had broken
coffin-shaped blocks from the stratified rock of the pier, that
some ancient wrinkling of the earth's crust had stood on edge,
and hurled them bodily upon the surface of the plateau. There
they lay scattered about at odd angles like giant sarcophagi. Old
Gershom, the scholar, used to say that the plateau was like a
stone yard, where slaves had chiselled out coffins for a
Pharaoh's household, or like some place where whip-goaded workmen
had knocked off for the noon hour in the midst of building a
pyramid. The old man had loved this place, for on this gaunt
plateau, it seemed to him that life was stripped of all its shams
and that he could see things as they were. Among these grim
coffin stones he used to wander on moonlit nights, to talk of
immortality to the sea and to watch the mist wraiths take strange
shapes on the face of the waters. Many a night, from this vantage
point, he had seen rough sea gods rise and gleam as they sported
in a breaking sea. The old man had told David and Gershom weird
tales of things seen and heard on the plateau, and they always
shunned it after nightfall.</p>
<p>A turfy pathway that the feet groped for in the darkness led
through the island from light to boathouse. The cleft, blasted
there in the cliff wall, was narrow and a place of danger, for
without cease the seas swilled into it, rattling beach rocks like
pebbles beneath the logs of the launch. To land or launch a boat
there was difficult on any day of the year, and on many days
positively dangerous. Old Gershom never slipped a boat off when
the Rock was breaking, but young Gershom, who had not the
resources of his father, never held to that rule in his years on
Barren Island. After lonely nights, his heart yearned for the
chatter of Uriah's fish house. He was tired of reading, and he
used to push off when the Rock was churning the sea white and
spouting like a school of whales.</p>
<p>Besides haunts, David and Gershom found real sources of
annoyance on Barren Island. Chief of these were the audacious
herring gulls, that nested by myriads among the rocks of the
western shore and with tireless pugnacity drove from their
kingdom all alien birds, plover, curlew, checkerbacks, and even
great ravens and gannets. Only the nasty careys escaped them, by
burrowing in the ground, and a few swallows that nested under the
barn's eaves survived through swiftness of wing. All day long, as
David and Gershom mended nets or tinkered at the boats, the gulls
screamed and, swooping low, circled about their heads. Sometimes
they planed high in the air and scornfully let their droppings
fall upon them. David and Gershom were something new to the
gulls--the old man had not stirred abroad much by day--they
regarded them as intruders in their ancient home and sought to
drive them off as they had driven plover and curlew.</p>
<p>Not less provoking were the careys! When the gulls ceased
their shrewish screaming at sundown, the careys, cursed birds of
night, sallied forth to make darkness hideous. Barren Island,
their favourite breeding place, was so infested with them that in
thick weather homebound fishermen of the bay used to say to one
another: "We's inside Barren Island now, 'cause de careys is left
us an' gone home." David and Gershom had long since learned to
hate these loathsome birds, and on the banks, in slack moments,
had knocked them down by dozens as they fluttered and crowded
behind their boats to pick up bits of fish entrails. In their
burrowing the careys had so polluted the soil of the island with
their malodorous scent of liver and gurry, that it was useless to
have a well on the island. Because of them the island springs
were defiled, and whoever kept the light had to depend for his
water supply on rain water drained from the lighthouse roof into
a cellar tank. It was on murky nights, when the careys were out
in force, that the two friends heard that unnatural voice cry
from the darkness: "Help, help! Ahoy, there, ahoy!"</p>
<p>During the first week of David's stay with his friend the
government supply steamer puffed up on her annual trip, anchored
near their launch, and lightered off to them bags of coal and
flour, barrels of salt beef and pork, drums of oil and gasoline,
coffee, tea, sugar, and a dozen other necessities against the
imprisonment of winter. Gershom had ordered as well some luxuries
for himself and David, chiefest and dearest among these two
buckets of hard red and white candies. The inspector came ashore
when the stores were landed, looked over the light, and with
stuffy dignity instructed Gershom in the approved method of
fixing and lighting the new mantles. While the instruction was in
process, David made such comical faces behind the inspector's
back that Gershom could hardly keep his countenance. "A hell of a
lot he knows about keepin' a light! I'd like fur to see him here
alone in one ragin' winter week. He'd holler fur mamma," said
Gershom as the inspector's boat pushed off from the launch.</p>
<p>It took David and Gershom a whole day to move the stores by
wheel and hand barrow from the tarpaulin-covered heap at the head
of the launch to the shelter of fuel shed and lighthouse. Cheeks
bulging with candies, singing and laughing, they made a game of
it and by turns wheeled each other on the empty barrow. To upset
the rider, the barrow above him, into some damp hollow was a bit
of light humour that invoked laughter and mutually warmed their
hearts. That day they paid no heed to the screaming gulls that,
outraged beyond words, were on their worst behaviour. It was a
great labour which made them happy in its accomplishment, and
satisfied an instinct that man shares with bee and squirrel of
laying up stores against the winter's cold.</p>
<p>The next day they set off to visit a rum runner that they
noticed jogging to seaward, awaiting boats from the main. After
the bargain had been struck, two ten-gallon kegs were hoisted
over the side into their lurching boat and laid snugly one on
either side of the centreboard. Then the captain, a burly
red-faced Frenchman from Miquelon, invited them aboard, and in
the shelter of his warm cabin plied them with rum that had paid
no government tax. Gershom boomed along, composing and enlarging
upon the scandalous gossip of the islands. David, aroused from
his customary shyness, told how the old ram, enraged by a vision
of expansive and unusual whiteness in his green pasture, had
butted Gershom over the cliff into the rockweed below, his hands
full of roots and gravel, his trousers dangling about his ankles,
and of the gentle rebuke the stranded Gershom had addressed to
the ram on the cliff wall above him. "Tell him agin, Dave," cried
Gershom, roaring with laughter. "Tell him agin what I said to de
old ram." David repeated his profane encore to a delighted
audience. "Now tell him de story o' de pipe an' socks," said
Gershom. "He'll like dat one." And David told how Dennis Born had
defiled Gershom's pipe as Gershom lay sleeping by the amidship
thwart, and how Gershom had revenged himself by feeding Dennis on
a stew in which two of Gershom's ancient socks were boiled. The
Miquelon captain thought them capital fellows and pressed on them
a bottle of champagne from his own private store. Time flew by.
In fact, they lingered almost too long, for as they clambered
down the runner's side the sun hung low in the western sky. The
light must be lit before his red disk dipped behind the distant
black rocks of The Ragged and haunted Sacrifice. The two reckless
cronies crouched singing in the stern as their boat slid through
the darkness. As they drove along, David thought:</p>
<p>"I'se happy now; I had bad luck in my young days, and my
gettin' married was nuttin' much, but I'se a partner in de
Rockbound firm, an' Gershom's my friend, an' we'se'll stick
togedder always."</p>
<p>Luck was with them! They made the launch in good time and
hauled out their boat shouting in unison:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"'Oh, Shenando' I love yur darter,<br>
Yo-ho, my rollin' river,'"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>as they strained against the capstan bars.</p>
<p>Gershom prized up a loose plank of the boat-house floor with
the tine of a rusty fish fork, and on the rock ledge below he and
David carefully laid one of the kegs. It had been the old man's
hiding place. There was really no need of a hiding place at all,
since there was no one on the island but themselves, and they
could always mark the approach of any stranger an hour before his
arrival. But David and Gershom were only two great overgrown
boys, and hiding the rum cask and pretending they were watched
and spied upon by the crew of the revenue cutter was the ritual
of a game they played with themselves. They had another long
drink from the remaining keg before David drove in the bung and
hoisted it upon his shoulder to carry it to the lighthouse.
Singing, he went across the turf, while Gershom in his wake
cursed the swooping gulls and threatened them with his stick.</p>
<p>Happy were the evenings of that holiday spent in the light
tower together. Without, as darkness came, it was cold and blowy;
within, snug and warm. Gershom rehearsed his endless adventures;
they laughed and roared at each other in deep booming voices
until far into the night.</p>
<p>On the last night of David's furlough, a gale, that increased
in fury with the hours, blew up from the southeast. Gershom lit
his lamp in the gray, lowering twilight, and was not a little
worried by a crack in one of the big outside panes, through which
a trickle of rain kept oozing. From the light tower he backed
down the ladder into the third-story room, where he and David
spent their evenings and slept. In this room were two hand-made
chairs, a rough table, two cot beds, a Franklin stove, and a
walnut desk littered with weather reports that Gershom filled out
daily. Three bookshelves on the eastern wall held the old man's
library. A hanging lamp that swayed with each furious gust of
wind cast a bright circle of light upon the floor but left the
corners in deep shadow.</p>
<p>"It's blowin' like hell," said Gershom, as his foot left the
ladder, "an one o' de big outside panes is got a crack what's
leakin'."</p>
<p>"Let her blow," answered David. "What cares us? No leak can't
sink dis ship."</p>
<p>While Gershom had been lighting the lamp he had brought up
from the kitchen a kettle of boiling water that, from its place
on the stove, sang and sent out friendly puffs. In a corner lay
the broached rum jug; on the table were a bowl of lump sugar,
glasses, and a plate of sliced lemons that David had bought from
the steward of the supply boat. Their last evening together was
to be a grand one.</p>
<p>Without, everything jingled and rattled in the blasts of the
gale; the light tower tugged at its windward cables as if it
would tear them from the rock; the sea roared against the natural
pier and flung its spray among Pharaoh's coffins. Careys, who
love the storm, were out in force. Once some great night bird,
dazzled by the light's glare, blundered against the glass and,
with a squawk of terror, fell to the kitchen roof below.</p>
<p>"A rare night for ghosts," said young Gershom as he took a
deep draught of hot rum and planted himself for the night's
work.</p>
<p>"Ay," said David, "I lays de footless nigger is flittin' dis
night on Rockbound."</p>
<p>"Dere's somethin' queer on dis island, too," said Gershom,
"dough I don't understand rightly why, 'cause de Sanford folks
tuk it away."</p>
<p>"How's dat?" asked David, though he knew the story well.</p>
<p>"You mind Johnny Publicover, de ghost catcher on Big
Outpost?"</p>
<p>"I minds him well, 'cause I lived nigh him when I was a
gaffer."</p>
<p>"Well, you'se heard how nigh de Sanford ghost was to ruinin'
Sanford. He had all de women an' children skeert, an' de men,
too, an' dey was dat skeert, dey was goin' to give up dere fish
stands an' move to oder parts o' de main or maybe some o' de
islands. Why, dat ghost use' to roll beach rocks down de front
hallway when de men folks was away, an' naught but women and
children huddled roun' de kitchen stove, and snatch gals away
from dere fellers on dark roads, an' he were dat audacious he use
to whang on de back o' de church at evening meetin'. One night he
gits dat bold, he reach in t'rough de back winder wid a brown
skinny arm an' put a glass o' rum on de side o' de pulpit when de
minister was a-preachin' a sermon on temperance. Warn't dat
audacious?"</p>
<p>"It were," replied David.</p>
<p>The query and answer were made for no rhetorical effect, but
for the purpose of allowing narrator and listener to pause long
enough to take another draught of hot rum and hold it in the
mouth a moment before letting the soul-kindling liquor trickle
slowly down the gullet.</p>
<p>"He were a holy terror audacious haunt, were dat Sanford
ghos'," continued Gershom, "but dat last ac' o' his got de
preacher's back up, an' he called a meetin' o' all de men in de
schoolhouse. Fore dis, de minister he'd bin tryin' to quiet de
people an' tellin' dem dere warn't no sich t'ing as ghos's. At de
meetin', Hezekiah Slaughenwhite--he's de great man in dem parts,
'cause he were de high-line fisherman on all de coast in de days
o' his yout'--he stud up an' says right off: 'Folks, de only
t'ing fur to do is to send fur Johnny Publicover, de ghos'
ketcher on de Outposts.'</p>
<p>"Den de preacher, he yells, 'No, Johnny Publicover's half a
witch hisself.' An' dere he were right, for him an' his wife had
de power o' makin' harness an' yokes break all to pieces on de
cattle ploughin' in de fields, if dey had a spite on ye."</p>
<p>"Ay," said David, "dey worked dat on Nat Young's boys."</p>
<p>"An' dey could make barnacles grow all ober a boat's bottom so
you could git ne'er a way on her. So de preacher he yells, 'No,
let's exercise him by prayer an' de power o' de Lord.'</p>
<p>"Den Israel Slaughenwhite says, 'Us don't want to exercise no
ghost, us wants to git rid o' him; he's gettin' exercise enough
trailing round de Sanford roads an' fields.'</p>
<p>"Den de preacher, he begin to explain what dis here exercisin'
really meant, but jus' at dat very moment dat audacious ghos'
goes whang, whang, whang, wid a big timber agin de back o' de
schoolhouse. He damn nigh bust in de rear end, dat time. Dat
settled dat, de preacher was finished, an' Israel got de vote all
round to send fur de ghos' ketcher."</p>
<p>Here Gershom paused as if his throat were dry and cast a
reproachful look at the empty glasses. David made haste to
prepare two more; the rounds of yellow lemon floated seductively
on top of the steaming amber liquor.</p>
<p>"So Israel's boys, Mattew and John, was sent nex' day to fetch
Johnny off Big Outpost. You knows 'em?"</p>
<p>"Ay," said David, "I knows 'em bot'."</p>
<p>"Towards evenin' dey landed back on Sanford, an' what ye t'ink
Johnny brung fur to ketch dat ghos'? A net wid a handle an' iron
ring like what we use fur scoopin' herrin' out o' a tub, his
long-barrelled duck gun, a halibut gaff tied fast to tree fadoms
eight-strand maniller rope, an' a big canvas bag wid a
drawstring. He had all dis gear harnessed ober his shoulders an'
de gaff rope lashed round his waist. You know how wizened an'
small an' scrawny an' black Johnny is? Well, standin' on de beach
wid dem great hulkin' Sanforders--dey's extry big men; air a one
o' Israel's boys goes ober two hundred--I guess Johnny cut some
comical figger. But he had de heart and de guts; he warn't
skeered o' no ghos', an' dey was.</p>
<p>"'Whar's dis here ghos' at?' Johnny yelled at dem. 'Fotch me
to him an' I'll capture him, same as I did de wild savage ghos'
on Rafuse Island.'</p>
<p>"'Us don't know whar he's at now,' said Israel.</p>
<p>"'How kin I ketch him when ye don't know whar he's at? Whar
did he haunt at last?'</p>
<p>"'At de meetin' in de schoolhouse las' night.'</p>
<p>"'Den have anoder meetin' dere to-night, an' if he haunts,
I'll ketch yur ghos',' said Johnny.</p>
<p>"Sure enough, dey holds anoder meetin' in de schoolhouse dat
night, wid Johnny ambushed in a big cleft o' split granite. Dey
gits de preacher to preach dat night, 'cause de ghos' delights to
aggravate him, an', hush, man, when de preacher gits goin' on how
de Lord fed de Children o' Israel on manna, de ghos' fetches de
back o' de schoolhouse whang, whang. Den de Sanforders was some
skeert an' nigh held dere breaths, till dey heard de bang o'
Johnny's duck gun. Den dey heard some squawkin' an' yellin' an'
runnin' t'rough de bushes, an' bimeby dey heard Johnny screechin'
way down in de t'ick woods. Nair a one o' dem big Sanforders
wentured out to help him, dey was dat skeered stiff. When dey
heard Johnny's voice hollerin' an' hulloin' jus' outside de
schoolhouse door, dey follered old Israel out. Johnny had
somet'in' in de bag all right, dey could see it movin' in de
lantern light.</p>
<p>"'Dere's yur haunt,' said Johnny, an' he guv de bag a kick,
an' de t'ing flopped an' fluttered an' squeaked. 'Dat were a
feeble haunt. I kotch dem worser nor dat.'</p>
<p>"'How you ketch him, Johnny?'" asked Israel.</p>
<p>"'Did ye no hear my gun go? I winged him wid dat shot, den I
chased him t'rough de bushes, whanged de net down ober his head,
gaffed him in de white o' de belly wid my halibut gaff, an'
stuffed him in dis here bag, an' dat's dat.'"</p>
<p>"What you s'pose he had in dat bag, now?" interrupted
David.</p>
<p>"I'm not supposin', I knows, 'cause de old man tole me, an'
you'll allow he warn't no fool. He had dat wery audacious Sanford
ghos'."</p>
<p>"My God, de sout'easter is a-snortin' tonight," interjected
David as a wild blast shook the tower and made the glasses on the
table dance and jingle.</p>
<p>"Dere's one good t'ing about it, Dave," said Gershom. "We
can't make no Rockbound to-morrow, not if Uriah pulls out all his
whiskers, an' we'll have anodder day an' night togedder."</p>
<p>David grinned and nodded his head in approval.</p>
<p>"We needs some more hot water, I can't tell no yarns wid a dry
t'roat," said Gershom. "You git it while I goes aloft and looks
at de crack in de pane."</p>
<p>Up the ladder climbed Gershom, and downstairs to the kitchen
went David, peering into every dark corner for haunts. He was
glad he had left a lighted lantern hanging in the kitchen. He
refilled his kettle, made his way quickly up the dark stairs, and
replenished the glasses.</p>
<p>"She's sure makin' de old light sing," shouted David as
Gershom's legs became visible on the ladder.</p>
<p>"Ay, dat she is," rejoined Gershom seating himself and toying
with his glass. "Let's see, where was I? Oh, yes, some o' dose
big Sanforders wanted to mash dat ghos' in de bag wid beach
rocks.</p>
<p>"'No,' says Johnny, 'ye can't mash dis kind. You got to land
him on a lonely an' uninhabited island. Dis kind can't cross
water.'</p>
<p>"Now, what do you s'pose dat bugger Johnny done? He charged
dem Sanforders five dollars fur a-ketchin' o' dere haunt."</p>
<p>"A power o' money fur one night's work."</p>
<p>"'Now,' he says to dem, says he, 'I won't budge wid him off
Sanford till ye pays me five dollars more. I contracted,' says
he, 'fur to ketch yur ghos', not fur to transport him about de
high seas. An' I kin loose haunts nigh as good as I kin ketch
dem.'"</p>
<p>"A sharp one is Johnny."</p>
<p>"Dat he is."</p>
<p>"So dey clubs togedder an' riz de extry five, an' de nex'
mornin' Israel's boys, dey rowed him off wid de haunt still
flutterin' an' squawkin' in de bag. An' where do you s'pose dey
landed dat ghos'?"</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Dat bugger Johnny landed him right here on Barren Island. Dat
were fore de light were built, an' dere warn't no human
habitations."</p>
<p>"An' is dat ghos' roamin' dis island now? Gershom, what fur
did ye take dis light?"</p>
<p>"Hush, man, till I tells you de res'. Dat ghos' were on dis
island fur many, many years, yes, till after de light were built.
When de ole man cum to live here, he often see dat haunt roamin'
round, but de ghos' paid him no heed, 'cause he knowed he
couldn't skeer ole Gershom Born. But I heard de ole man say dat,
many a night, he seed dat ghos' in de moonlight stretched out
flat on de coffin stones, a-moanin' like all possessed an'
grievin' fur his ancient home in Sanford.</p>
<p>"Well, one fine Sunday afternoon cum some lads from Sanford to
visit de ole man an' to ask him somethin' about air a deed or
will. Along wid dey brung a jug o' over-proof rum, an' dem an' de
ole man drunk dat strong rum de livelong afternoon. Dey got
drunk, all right, an' laffed and ollered an' fought an' had a
good time. Den, along towards sundown, de Sanford fellers allowed
as how dey'd better make off fur de main. Down dey went to dere
boat, de ole man follerin' an' singin' along de path. Ye mind how
he used to sing an' use mighty big-soundin' words when he was
right drunk?"</p>
<p>"I minds well."</p>
<p>"Dey launches dere boat in a calm sea, but jus' as de las' man
clumb aboard, somethin' stepped into dat boat dat put her right
down to de gunwales. 'Twere de Sanford ghos' leavin' Barren
Island, de ole man said, an' travellin' to his ancient home on de
main. Dem Sanforders got out dere oars an' rowed like crazy mens,
wid de water lappin' dere gunwales all de way, an' when dey cum
to de Sanford beach de ghos' stepped out an' de boat riz a foot
outer de water."</p>
<p>"Didn't yur ole man see dat Sanford haunt no more on dis
island?"</p>
<p>"No more he did, but he seen plenty o' queer small haunts, an'
dey're round here to dis day."</p>
<p>It was long after midnight when Gershom had finished his
story.</p>
<p>"Time to turn in," suggested David.</p>
<p>"Why turn in? You'se dead when you'se asleep. I wants to be
alive always. Let's have a nightcap, anyway," replied
Gershom.</p>
<p>The gale was now at the height of its fury; joist and rafter
groaned as the wind whistled through the supporting cables and
swayed the tower. When the nightcap had been brewed and drunk,
Gershom lurched to the ladder and climbed it unsteadily to see if
the light were burning true. When his legs, body, and empurpled
face descended from the square of blackness he said: "Dat crack
in de pane's worse, we got to stand anchor watches."</p>
<p>"All right," said David.</p>
<p>"You do de first hour's trick, an' I'se'll do de second. I'se
de quickest man to undress in all dese islands." Gershom slipped
the braces from his shoulders, and letting his trousers fall in a
huddled heap on the floor, sprang into his bed all standing. He
puffed at his pipe for a moment, as he always did before
sleeping, then laid it down carefully where it could be seized at
the instant of waking, and in a moment was snoring.</p>
<p>David, left alone, listened for a while to the fury of the
wind and hoped that no vessels were close inshore that night. He
crossed the room to the bookshelves and tried to amuse himself by
looking at the pictures in old Gershom's books. He regretted
deeply at that moment that he had never learned to read. In one
large book he found pictures of devils being forked onto burning
coals, and of hideous dog-faced men standing neck-high in frozen
ponds. He knew it was a bad book to look at on such a wild night
after hearing Gershom's story of the Sanford ghost, but the
pictures fascinated him, and he kept on turning pages that
revealed worse horrors. Suddenly, in the light tower above his
head came a terrifying, an awful noise. A ripping and rending was
followed by a crash as if someone had dumped a ton of glass down
the stairs.</p>
<p>"Up, Gershom, up," stammered David. "De light's all smashed to
hell."</p>
<p>Gershom leaped out of bed and ran up the ladder, his shirt
bellying out behind him. David followed close at his heels. They
stared at one another in amazement; the light was burning calm
and clear. Except for the trickle that oozed through the cracked
pane, naught was amiss in the light tower.</p>
<p>"What's de matter wid you, Dave?" asked Gershom in high
dudgeon as they descended. "Is dat drop o' rum gone to yur head?
Can't ye carry yur liquor no more?"</p>
<p>"Hush, man, I ain't drunk. Dere certainly were one awful crash
and bang up dere."</p>
<p>Gershom turned in without another word, but scarcely had he
settled his great bulk in bed and drawn up the quilt when again
came a mighty thumping and a crash of shattered glass. Up sprang
the undaunted blond giant to run up the ladder and again find the
light burning without flaw or flicker.</p>
<p>Gershom came below slowly and pulled on his pants. "No sleep
fur us to-night, lad; one o' dem minor haunts is workin' on
us."</p>
<p>So they sat close together through the night, sipped rum, and
paid no further heed to the wind demons that ramped and roared
above them. Toward morning their eyes sagged wearily, and David
felt a new thrill of terror when Gershom, in an unearthly voice,
began an obscene address to a black and yellow dog that he said
lived under his walnut desk and came out only on the wane of the
moon. When the eastern sky was gray with dawn and the rim of the
sun peeked above Metatogan, they put out the light and slept.</p>
<p>When they awoke, they found that the gale had blown out its
fury, though big seas still romped among the coffin rocks of the
plateau. About noon the wind hauled to the northwest and laid the
waves the southeaster had raised. As the sea abated, David knew
that Uriah would expect him and that he must go. In the early
afternoon, he and Gershom got the boat ready and pushed off into
the sea. They were both sad and low at heart. David hated to
leave his friend, whom he would see but seldom; Gershom dreaded
being left alone on his island. On the passage to Rockbound they
scarcely spoke to each other.</p>
<p>"Ye'll come and have Christmas dinner wid, Gershom," said
David as they rounded the Grampus.</p>
<p>"Ay, lad, dat I'se'll be glad to do, if dere's no ice,"
answered Gershom.</p>
<p>They shook hands and said good-bye on Uriah's launch. Then the
great-shouldered Gershom pushed off alone, and standing in his
boat's stern kept turning and waving his hand till the point shut
him out. David, at the launch head, duffel bag in hand, stared
after him, thinking his two weeks' holiday on Barren Island the
freest and richest period of his life and that he had now sealed
a friendship with Gershom that nothing could ever break.</p>

<p>As David, on his return from Barren Island, strode up the
pathway toward his house, he was surprised to find his heart
beating faster. Tamar was waiting on his back doorstep, to
welcome him without a word of complaint. He dropped the dunnage
bag from his shoulder, threw his arms about her, and gave her a
hearty kiss. Tamar, who had never been greeted thus before, was
delighted, for she loved her man. David's heart glowed as he
stepped into his neat, warm kitchen. In spite of his regret at
leaving Gershom, it was indeed a grand thing to come home to a
house and wife of your own after pigging it for two weeks on a
ghost-ridden island. "Poor Gershom," he thought, "out dere alone
wid nair a wife nur kids to talk wid. Eighty dollars a mont' an'
grub ain't wort' it."</p>
<p>Uriah set him to tanning nets the day after his arrival, and
with that labour accomplished he had work enough of his own to
do. Knee-deep in snow, he cut trees on his wood lot and sawed and
split a high pyramid of firewood. From storm-strewn beaches he
hauled load upon load of sea dung, kelp, and rockweed and cast it
into his barn cellar, to rot with the barn manure for his garden
patch of potatoes and cabbages. In the long winter evenings by
the kitchen stove he patiently mended rents that dogfish and
albacore had torn in his nets, and shaved out big net buoys of
dried fir wood. Orange he painted them, so that his searching
eyes might catch them readily against the black waves, and Tamar,
with deft brush, made a blue D on one side of them and a J on the
other. They smiled at each other and looked proudly upon the gay
pile of buoys that glistened in mid-floor. It was a symbol of
their partnership.</p>
<p>But what a mess he had made of Tamar's kitchen with paint
pots, brushes, splinters, shavings, and bits of net marline! That
set him to thinking: he must have a "building," as every
well-equipped fisherman had; a place that would be all his own,
where he could go when he wanted to be alone, keep his gear and
shave, paint, and whittle to his heart's content. Tamar had made
no complaint, but it was hardly fair to a woman to clutter up her
kitchen. Yes, a building he must have that would be all his own!
For the convention of Rockbound decreed that a "building" was
unlike dwelling, barn, or fish house; it was sanctuary, a man's
very own, a place that no woman set foot within, just as no
Rockbound fisherman dreamed of demeaning himself by entering a
wooden backhouse, a place for women and children.</p>
<p>He knew well that neither Jung nor Kraus would aid him, but
Gershom would come, when the sea permitted, to help him raise the
frame. He confided none of these plans to Tamar, but when he
began his trips to the main, on days of moderate calm, to fetch
swamp spruce for his lobster-pot bows, he carried home as well a
load of boards and studding. It was a mild open winter with
little drift ice in the bay, and almost daily his boat returned
to the launch gunwale-deep. The sills, joists, and rafters he
hewed out of spruces cut on his own wood lot.</p>
<p>When the materials were ready, Gershom came one frosty day to
help David raise his frame. The giant made a great noise, as was
his wont, blew upon his fingers, and picked up one end of a sill
as if it were a match stick. Krauses and Jungs came to look on,
stamping the snow with their feet and making jeering remarks on
the open joints and general crudeness of the workmanship, but
Gershom's tongue was sharp and bitter, and they often went away
crestfallen. In early March came a long spell of bad weather, and
Gershom was, for that time, imprisoned on Barren Island. Then
David laboured on his building alone, singing as he drove home
frosty nails, while Tamar within the house smiled as she heard
his hammer ring, and cut and stitched tiny garments for the baby
she expected.</p>
<p>The snow melted in the cleft between the knolls, the ice on
Nigger Pond broke into cakes, sea ducks were bedded near the
Rock, and the raw winds of spring began to blow. April was a
rough month; every day the rollers thundered on the sand beach,
crashed into the dog holes, and made the cannon rock roar and
spout, but in spite of wind and weather David tended his lobster
traps daily, venturing out when no other Jung or Kraus dared run
a boat off the launch. "He'll come home keel up one o' dese
days," they said to one another with lowering brows.</p>
<p>One gray dawn in late April, as he was pulling on his sea
boots preparatory to setting off for his traps, Tamar called to
him from the bedroom: "You'd bes' be askin' Anapest to step ober,
I feels de pains comin' on me." Anapest was the island's midwife
and, in spite of her hatred of Uriah's brood, had delivered every
infant born on the island in forty years past. Her heart melted
with compassion at the sight of a Jung woman in labour.</p>
<p>David crossed the fields to Anapest's house and delivered the
message before setting out. That day he had to make his long
route around Barren Island shoal, and he had promised Gershom to
bring him a bundle of papers, if it were smooth enough to make a
landing. It was a day of bad luck: his boat stuck on the launch
and, to his deep chagrin, he could only get her off by enlisting
Casper's help, and three of his moorings had chaffed off and gone
to sea. That meant loss of both mooring and lobster trap. By the
time he had hauled and rebaited his remaining traps and paid his
visit to Gershom--for a landing had been effected--it was late
afternoon, and when his homing boat rounded West Head and stood
in for the launch, dusk was falling. As he came up the logs of
the launch, some weight seemed to press upon his heart; all was
not well on the island, he knew that some evil thing threatened
him. Quickly he threw his lobsters into the floating crate and
hurried up the path to his house.</p>
<p>Anapest met him on the back doorstep. "De baby's come--it's a
boy; but yur woman's right sick."</p>
<p>David hurried into the bedroom where Tamar lay, whitefaced.
She was in great pain and but half conscious. To his deep
distress, she did not know him.</p>
<p>"Is air a man gone fur de doctor?" he queried.</p>
<p>"No," replied Anapest.</p>
<p>"Why de hell not?"</p>
<p>"She only come on bad two hours gone. De sea's risin' wid de
night, an' a fog shuttin' down. Dey say it's too big a risk
makin' Minden dis night."</p>
<p>"I kin make Minden in any weder if her own brudders an' fader
can't. I'se'll be back wid de doctor by dawn. Stay wid her
t'rough de night an' mind her an' de kid good," and he was off.
In a moment of emotional stress he had dared give an order to
Anapest, and she had accepted it without resentment or protest.
He was as good as his word; he drove the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i>
through fog and sea and fetched a shivering, unwilling doctor by
dawn, but it was too late, Tamar was dead.</p>
<p>As David stood by the bedside of his dead wife, in the sad
light of morning, the doctor muttering words of attempted
comfort, life seemed hopeless and futile. Life was like the sea
that began the destruction of an island as soon as it had made
it. It seemed to him impossible, that Tamar, yesterday full of
strength and vitality, could be lying there as lifeless as a
stone. Childbirth was regarded by him and by every soul on
Rockbound as a simple function of nature. From his dead wife upon
the bed his distressed glance wandered to the tiny red mite that
Anapest had wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a box near
the stove, and thinking of his own wretched childhood spent in
that very house he uttered a vow in a solemn voice.</p>
<p>"By God, Tamar lass, dat kid, if he lives, won't have to
endure what I done. I'll promise ye dat, lass! He'll have
learnin', he will, and he won't be beat up by me, nor no oder man
on Rockbound, nor in de whole world."</p>
<p>With his own hands, David shaped Tamar's coffin of white
boards, bought for the sheathing of his building. Sick at heart,
it gave him some comfort to perform this simple office for her.
Though his courtship had been without romance, though he had
never loved her deeply, he had spent with her his first period of
clean and comfortable living, and his respect and affection had
grown for her steadily. She had been a good housewife and a grand
worker. She had looked after his interests in the Jung firm and
had daily checked the fares in the fish house. Now helper and
comrade were gone.</p>
<p>With Tamar dead and Gershom on Barren Island, he was alone,
and he felt that the fierce struggle of life, forgotten through
that one winter, was to begin all over again. His conjecture was
right. With Tamar dead, Casper, Joseph, and Martin became more
spiteful than before. It seemed to them, now that his wife was
gone, that he had won his way into the firm without paying the
price, and by day and night they bedevilled Uriah to find some
crafty pretext for throwing David out. But old Uriah could not be
persuaded. "A bargain's a bargain," he hurled back at the nagging
Casper, though he did not reveal to him the true inward working
of his mind. He knew that if he put David out of the firm David
would set up a fish house on the land he had bought from Anapest,
that he would lose his best worker, and the Jung firm be out
money. The old king could see farther than any of his boys, and
though he turned their arguments over in his mind and shared
their dislike of David, he revealed none of his thoughts but
simply mumbled over and over: "A bargain's a bargain," and
delighted in the impotent rage he saw in Casper's face. Casper,
in a dark corner, whispered to Joseph and Martin: "What's de
matter wid de ole man? He's gettin' soft in de head. We'se 'll
have to push him out. A bargain's a bargain! He never stuck to no
bargains in de past 'less he had to."</p>
<p>Tamar's baby was named Ralph in accordance with Tamar's wish;
Anapest undertook to rear him, and Fanny, the potato girl, who
was nursing a baby of her own and who made herself useful in
every emergency, volunteered to feed him. David, as a relief to
his feelings, crossed the fields to Anapest's house whenever he
was through his day's work, to look at the infant. He lifted him
sometimes in his great hands, held him at arm's length, and while
Anapest and Fanny laughed at his clumsiness, stared at the child
with wonder. The fact of the child's existence sobered David and
made a decided change in his way of thinking and general attitude
toward life. He was no longer, he felt, a free and irresponsible
individual. Nor did he forget the vow he had made at Tamar's
bedside: the boy should have education and a chance to escape
this island of hatred and do something in the world. After these
interviews, he used to wander back to his lonely kitchen and sit
there thinking through long evenings alone. He needed company,
but he could not bring himself to go back to the sharesman's loft
now that Gershom was no longer there. His loneliness was
accentuated by memories of the past and by the fact that all the
Jungs were against him. He dreamed sometimes of establishing a
fish stand with Gershom on Barren Island, though he knew there
was no wood there. He longed for peace and quiet, to get away
from the hell of driving work, from greed and hatred, and the
perpetual quarrels and nagging recriminations that were carried
on between the rival families.</p>
<p>But he could not escape the strife. In fact, the summer after
Tamar's death was a particularly hateful one, a summer of
unending quarrels. First there was the business of building a
schoolhouse. The world was advancing, and in spite of all that
Uriah could do, the land breeze carried ideas even to remote
Rockbound, and the third generation of Jungs and Krauses began to
think that their children should learn to read and write. They
met in general conclave in the loft of the Jung fish house, and
there, seated on trawl tubs and bundles of nets, listened to
Casper, the traveller, talk on the necessity of education for
their children. Uriah and Anapest were not present at this
meeting, for the two heads of the rival clans never met when
meeting could be avoided; but Anapest was represented by
Christian, Nicholas, and Melcher, while Uriah, through his agents
Joseph and Martin, fiercely opposed the establishment of a
school. Had the brave old Jungs, who made Rockbound, been readers
and writers? They had had no time for such foolishness. Anapest
at first was lukewarm, but hearing of Uriah's violent opposition
to the school she became a zealot in the cause of education.
After several sullen meetings, Casper, backed by David, who
thought of little Ralph, and by the Kraus faction directed by
Anapest, carried the day, and it was forthwith voted to build a
one-room schoolhouse on the road to the light, and that all the
men of the island should labour on it jointly.</p>
<p>For the first time in Rockbound history Jungs and Krauses
attempted something in coöperation. What endless arguments they
had about the size of the foundation, the height of the plate,
the pitch of the rafters! With the frame up, they abandoned
coöperation and agreed that the Jungs should build the north
gable end, the east side and roof, and that Krauses should
construct the rest. There the Jungs outdid the Krauses, for the
front door came in their southern gable. Jungs sawed and hammered
on the eastern side of the roof and ignored the Krauses who sawed
and hammered on the other side. So great was the family rivalry
that the schoolhouse was built with expedition, for Krauses would
not let Jungs outdo them in quantity of work, nor would Jungs let
Krauses outdo them. By the very nature of their isolated lives,
they were skilled workers with tools and knew how to build curved
boats with graceful sheer. And if one knows how to build a boat,
the construction of a straight-lined schoolhouse is a matter of
ease. Uriah shook his head as he stamped up and down the lane and
prophesied that the school would bring evil upon the island, and
in that the old man was right, though he thought only of the
immediate and not the distant future.</p>
<p>With the schoolhouse completed, the trouble really began.
David stood as far apart as he could from the quarrels, but it
was inevitable that he should often be enmeshed. Because he
wanted the school for his boy, he had to throw his weight now on
one side, now on the other, and as a consequence he was trusted
by neither faction. There was a secretary-treasurer to be
elected, a teacher to be hired, and assessments to be made in
accordance with each man's property holdings. Uriah, who owned
eight tenths of the island, and upon whom the bulk of the
assessment fell, stormed, raged, and refused to pay, until
Anapest threatened to have the law of him. Casper assured him
that he would assuredly lose in a law trial, and the old king
bitterly cursed the Krauses, David Jung, and his false son
Casper, as he fumbled with the lock of his money box.</p>
<p>On the eve of the election of secretary there was tense
excitement in both camps. The two bosses lined up their electors
and dictated policies. With Casper as chairman, Uriah saw that
the Krauses would have an advantage in numbers unless he himself
was present and voted. He could not depend upon David, who
straddled the party fence.</p>
<p>Anapest and Uriah mutually surprised each other by coming to
the great meeting held at evening in the new school. It was
inevitable that the great question should arise, can a woman
vote? This question was settled once for all on Rockbound, while
suffragettes were still chaining themselves to the palings of the
House of Parliament, and buffeting policemen in the streets of
London.</p>
<p>Uriah opened the ball with: "Women ain't got no vote in dis
meetin'."</p>
<p>"Dat dey is," answered Anapest.</p>
<p>"It ain't nateral, it ain't allowed in no land," retorted
Uriah.</p>
<p>"Natural fur women to have no say, is it? Den how come dere's
women queens?"</p>
<p>That was a bomb! Uriah had heard of Victoria, and Casper of
Elizabeth. There was a moment of tense silence.</p>
<p>"We ain't electin' no queens to-night," was all the old man
could think of to say.</p>
<p>"No, we ain't electin' no queens, we'se electin' a secretary,
an' don't I own land an' pay fur de teacher same as de res' o'
you? Can't I haul a line an' lug a barrow good as air a man on
Rockbound? Tell me, does pants make ye vote? Many's de warm night
when I wears nuttin' but oil pants in de fish house."</p>
<p>When David brought the hat around, Anapest cast in her ballot
defiantly, and Casper the chairman announced after the count that
Christian Kraus had been elected by four to three. One vote had
been discarded by the chairman, who thought himself entitled to
the secretaryship, but whether it was David's vote or Anapest's
no man knows to this day. Anapest was satisfied with her victory
and flounced out of the meeting. Uriah tore a handful of hair
from his beard, and throwing his straw hat upon the floor
trampled it into fragments. Christian Kraus was to collect and
hold the school money and pay the teacher. Gershom Born was the
only person who got any fun out of the new school; he wrote
several ballads about it and carried the news of the conflict to
a circle of eager-eared gossips in Jennie Run-over's place on the
Outposts.</p>
<p>But the wrangling over the schoolhouse, though longer in time,
was a mere nothing when compared in intensity with the quarrel
over the hole in the road. A road that ran north and south over
the narrowed part of the island from launches to Southeast Cove
marked the boundary between the properties of Anapest and Uriah,
and by some ancient and immemorial treaty the Krauses were bound
to keep in repair the north end, the Jungs the south end. Now,
what did some demon of discord do one day but scoop out a hole in
this road at a point equidistant from launches to beach. The
summer was a rainy one, and though the hole grew deeper daily,
neither family would mend it. Krauses said it was the Jungs' job;
Jungs said it was the Krauses' job, and the ox carts of both
families, hauling sea dung from the cove, foundered hub deep, to
their mutual discomfort.</p>
<p>Uriah, stung by his defeat in the matter of the school, met
Christian Kraus one day and flatly ordered him to fill the hole
with a cartload of gravel, and that without delay. A wordy
dispute followed, and Christian departed in a rage to report the
whole story to his empress mother. Anapest listened to his tale,
stamped her feet upon the kitchen floor in anger, and, girding up
her belt, sallied forth upon Uriah, who was spreading a net in a
field to the westward of his fish house.</p>
<p>"What you mean givin' orders to my boys?" she shrieked.</p>
<p>"I means dat puddle's got to be filled in."</p>
<p>"Den let some o' yur own spawn fill it in, or fill it in yur
own self. It ain't on my land. Who you t'inks you is, anyhow? A
king dey calls ye. Well, you'se an ugly king, an' ye may be king
on yur own land, but ye can't boss my boys. I owns my own lands,
an' you an' yur boys keep to hell off dem."</p>
<p>"Dat puddle's got to be filled in," shouted the old man
stubbornly, "an' I ain't got no time to stand here argeying wid
no woman."</p>
<p>"A woman, a woman," yelled Anapest. "Don't ye call me no
woman, ye old bugger, or I'se 'll pull de whiskers off yur face,
old as ye is. I knows what you t'inks a woman's fur, to raise a
flock o' kids an' be worked to deat' in yur stinkin' fish house.
If I was yur woman, I'd show ye."</p>
<p>"I'd sooner have air a wild beast in de house nor you."</p>
<p>Then Anapest flung her cap upon the ground, tore down her
hair, and began to weep with rage. Her yells and sobs could be
heard over half the island. Crouching low and bending forward,
Anapest advanced upon Uriah opening and closing her fists, as if
in anticipation of the moment when they would close upon the old
man's hair and whiskers. She was a terrifying object in her
position of attack, with her hair hanging in tousled strands
about her face. Uriah was no coward, but he was bewildered as to
his plan of action. It was impossible to join in fisticuffs with
a woman; the news would spread quick as fog from island to island
and make him an object of laughter and general derision. He
decided on retreat, and, waiting till Anapest got within reach,
he threw the net over her head and ran as fast as his old legs
would carry him for the shelter of the fish house. He barred the
door and waited. Peeping through a chink, he saw that young
Gershom Born had landed from Barren Island and seen and overheard
all. He was annoyed to think that the news of Anapest's shameful
attack and his retreat would travel fast to the Outposts. Gershom
might even make a ballad about it that would be sung all over the
islands. He never forgave Gershom for having landed at that
inopportune moment, and for having witnessed his disgraceful
encounter with Anapest and his ignominious flight to the fish
house. For Uriah had been a stout man in his day, and he had a
deep sense of the dignity of his kingship.</p>
<p>However, the old man had not much time to reflect on Gershom's
opinion, for Anapest, entangled in the net like a giant albacore,
let out a flood of curses and abuse that would have done credit
to the stoutest fishwife of Billingsgate. Freed at last from the
meshes, she advanced toward Uriah's fish house and pounded upon
the barred door with a broken oar handle.</p>
<p>"Come out, ye hoary old robber, an' I'se 'll teach ye to order
my boys around. A woman, is I? Ye dat snatches a crust from de
moufs o' widows an' orphans."</p>
<p>But Uriah made no response from his secure retreat, and when
Anapest had spent most of her fury in wordy abuse, she burst into
tears and retired to her own domain.</p>
<p>Entering her kitchen she found David there looking at the
infant Ralph.</p>
<p>"Git out o' my house," she screamed at him. "Git out o' my
house. You'se a Jung, too. I won't have nair a Jung in dis
house."</p>
<p>"Why you talk like dat, Aunt Anapest? Ain't you a Jung by
blood, too?"</p>
<p>"I'se not no Jung, I'se a Kraus. Git out o' dis house. Ye
works wid dat gang. I don't let no Jung enter dis house nur cross
my land."</p>
<p>"I got fur to enter yur house an' to cross yur land fur to see
my child."</p>
<p>That must have touched Anapest's heart, for she sat down
suddenly at the kitchen table and began again to cry, pulling her
gray hair over her face.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean fur to say dat, David. Ye can come an' see yur
child, an' I'll rear him well fur ye, too. We can't take nair a
spite out on dat innocent."</p>
<p>By this time the Kraus boys, alarmed by Anapest's shrieks,
arrived in the kitchen and glowered at David.</p>
<p>"Dere's a curse on dat branch o' de Jungs," cried Anapest,
raising her head, "an' I'se 'll tell ye why now. Dere's a curse
on George's branch, an' dat's what makes dem so greedy an' mean.
Ole George, Uriah's fader, were cruel an' mean jus' like Uriah,
but our grandfader Edward were gentle an' kind. An' I'll tell ye
all now how de curse come on George's branch.</p>
<p>"One winter night, long 'fore us was born, a brig from de West
Indies busted in on de dog holes to de soudard o' de island. A
white man an' a nigger come ashore. De nigger's legs was broke
off below de knees, but de white man had life in him. Edward were
off de island, but ole George an' his sharesman carried de bodies
to de house, where de old folks lived, an' laid dem on de kitchen
floor by de stove. Den ole George got right skeered o' de bodies,
an' de women an' children began to yell, specially when dey sees
de nigger wid no feet. So he carried out de bodies an' laid dem
in de eel grass by de pig pen. Dey was both froze stiff in de
mornin', an' den, sure nuff, de white man had no life in him.
George buried 'em bot' in de sand heap by Nigger Pond, an' two
days arter, when de nigger's feet come ashore in his boots, he
buried dem in de field below where de light is now. Dat's how dem
Jungs brung de curse on Rockbound. You might say as how ole
George murdered dat white man. It's dat nigger dat can't rest dat
goes flittin' foggy nights lookin' fur his feet, an' it's de
haunt o' de white man what had life in him an' dey froze dat
pushes Uriah off de path into de tall timothy."</p>
<p>Anapest finished her epic and stood up to twist her hair into
a knot. Suddenly she turned on her boys.</p>
<p>"What you standin' here fur? Ain't dey plenty o' work on de
land or in de fish house?"</p>
<p>David started out with the others, but Anapest called to him:
"You come back, David, fur to see yur kid whenever ye wants.
You'se a good Jung an' sprung from ole Edward's line."</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the day of the great quarrel, David took
wheelbarrow and shovel and filled in the hole with beach rocks
and gravel. For this act Uriah denounced him in the fish house,
before the brothers, as a traitor to the Jungs.</p>
<p>"You's half in league wid dem bloody Krauses," the old man
stormed at him.</p>
<p>That night, as David sat in his kitchen, he wondered if there
were people in the world who lived in peace and quiet. Would he
ever reach such a place? He and Tamar had never fought. He had
half a mind to sell his place to Uriah, who would be an eager
buyer, and try living among folk on the main. But perhaps it
would be the same there. The Boutiliers of Miscou, he remembered,
had sometimes quarrelled fiercely among themselves. Moreover, why
should he be such a coward as to sell his mother's place to
Uriah? The old urge to stand fast by his rights asserted itself.
He was heartily sick of Rockbound, but he must stick it out and
stand as firm as Uriah and his boys. In the darkness he cried
aloud: "O God, if dey is a God what cares fur men at all, give me
some peace an' quiet in my life afore I dies."</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The school postulated a teacher. A few days after the great
battle between Anapest and Uriah, Mary Dauphiny, whom Christian
Kraus had engaged to teach the Rockbound school, arrived on the
island. Old Jean Dauphiny brought her in his boat from their home
in Bay of God's Mercy, and having landed Mary and her possessions
and bespoken her a boarding place, stopped for a little while to
talk with Uriah, whom he had known in days gone by.</p>
<p>Mary Dauphiny, a pretty girl of twenty, came of fisherfolk on
the main. She was of moderate height and strongly built, and as
she had worked with the men in fish house and hayfield, she knew
what was expected of women by labour-driven fishermen. When she
had been allowed to go to school in the winters, she had shown
such quickness and aptitude in reading, writing, and arithmetic
that the local schoolmaster had told her parents that she should
be trained as a teacher. At this announcement, old Jean Dauphiny
had hummed and hawed, wagged his head, and said that learning was
no good for a fisher lass. But his pride had been touched, none
the less, and eventually he consented to send Mary to the county
academy at Liscomb, where she took her B certificate with credit,
and afterward to the normal school at Landor for her teacher's
licence. Old Jean was proud of his girl's success and began to
urge her on. He could very well spare Mary from farm and fish
stand, for his money box, hidden at the foot of a brown rafter,
was well filled, and besides her he had eight growing children,
and a second wife, a shrewish Surette from Fond du Baie, who
nagged and laboured from dawn to dusk.</p>
<p>Mary took to learning greedily, read a great many books not on
required courses, found out much about life that had been hidden
from her parents and those before them, but never lost her sense
of values nor became ashamed of her antecedents. Pale-faced,
thin-shouldered men of the inland towns she compared to their
disadvantage with the bronzed, deep-chested fishermen, who moved
with catlike grace and ease to let go sheet or halliard. When she
came home for vacations, she would gib herring, rake hay, and
even go on the offshore banks with her father, if he were short a
sharesman. Of all his children, she was beyond doubt old Jean
Dauphiny's favourite, and he often boasted of her when a little
drunk. "Dere's a lass fur he," he used to say to his friends.
"Larnin' hasn't sp'ilt her. She kin do a day's work wid air a
lass on de coast, an' she plays de organ somet'in' beautiful.
Larned it all by herself, she did."</p>
<p>Rockbound was Mary's first school. One has to begin at the
beginning in school-teaching, and Rockbound, with its illiterate
adult population, stood near the bottom of the scale. On the day
after her arrival, she opened the school and felt a strange
sinking at heart as the children took their places before her.
There were no established school conventions or traditions to
strive against; still, she was a stranger from an outside world,
and hence, at first, an enemy to the children of Rockbound. Her
gracious fairness soon won their hearts, and she in turn began to
enjoy the task of sowing in virgin soil.</p>
<p>As she walked up the lane to the schoolhouse on brisk
September mornings, her cheeks glowing, the tassel of her red
stocking cap bobbing in the breeze, she was undoubtedly an
attractive girl. David thought so, as he looked at her from afar.
He liked the way she carried herself and her earnest intent in
going about her business. She had a decided trace of French
vivacity, for the Dauphinys had been established on this coast
when the whole region was known as La Tuque. Yes, even before
that, when the bay was known by the old Indian name Merlegash,
bay of milk-white waves, and that was a good century before the
landing of the Germans, Dutch, and Flemings in 1750. True, the
Dauphinys of Mary's time had forgotten their patois, and perhaps
even their origin, but, along with the Houblys and Boutiliers,
they retained a few French traits that made them different from
their neighbours. In Mary the inherited traits were marked. Her
kind brown eyes were wide apart; she showed white, well-formed
teeth when she smiled; but the real charm of her face lay in a
short upper lip and a slightly tilted nose that gave to her face
at times a saucy and almost impish expression. Young women are
not marked, as are men, by the station in which they are born,
and such was Mary Dauphiny's bearing and natural dignity that,
had she been beautifully gowned, she would have graced the finest
assembly in the land.</p>
<p>All Rockbound approved her within a month. She was, perhaps,
the islanders first object of general approbation. Fanny, the
potato girl, looked at her shyly and sighed for something she had
missed in life. Mary, in turn, who listened to no gossip, liked
Fanny better than any of the younger Rockbound women. They spent
their lives watching for the boats, or in peering beneath a drawn
blind to see who was going down the lane, and were mere
reflections of their husbands' partisan opinions. Fanny, at any
rate, tidied herself and put on a clean dress after each day's
work, and that appealed to Mary's sense of order. Mary went out
of her way to talk with Fanny, invited her to sing while she
played the organ, and volunteered to teach her reading and
writing. Uriah's only comment on the new teacher was, "A new
broom sweeps clean," but that was high praise coming as it did
from Uriah. Casper dropped his long chin and formed his lips into
what he considered a smile of friendship whenever he met her, and
Anapest, the old empress, stood behind her as a tower of
strength.</p>
<p>On afternoons, when David got in early from the banks, it used
to do his heart good to see the little children flocking up the
school lane at the clang of the bell. For in the tiny belfry
perched on the ridgepole the Rockbounders had hung a bell, a
ship's bell with a fine clear tone, salvaged years ago by Uriah
from the wreck of <i>The Lady of Gaspé,</i> and from it a rope
dangled to the schoolroom below. At the first stroke of this
bell, children darted from near-by houses to run up the lane and
crowd into the schoolhouse, where Mary stood awaiting them.
Little Jungs and little Krauses played games together at recess
and sat side by side in the schoolroom, to con their lessons from
the self-same book. "Dey won't fight and quarrel an' be so full
o' suspicions 'bout one anoder when dey grows up," thought David,
as he stood watching with his arm hooked over the prow of his
boat. He wished, in such moments, that he had had a chance to
learn reading. Reading would take away the loneliness of long
winter evenings, and perhaps make a man wise, like old Gershom
Born. Could a grown man learn it? he wondered. Someone would have
to help little Ralph when he started school, and in his present
state of ignorance, he felt himself a poor kind of father. A seed
of desire was sown in his mind. "Why not ask her," he thought,
"if a grown feller like me kin learn readin'?"</p>
<p>One afternoon, when the children burst out of school with
shrill cries, and made their way homeward, he summoned all his
courage and walked up the lane to the schoolhouse. Mary, seated
at the teacher's desk, was making up her register in neat
figures. She heard the strange footstep and looked up as he
entered.</p>
<p>"Good-evenin'," he said. "I wants fur to ask ye
somethin'."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Do ye t'ink dat a feller as old as me could learn
readin'?"</p>
<p>"Of course you could."</p>
<p>"How does ye start fur to do it?"</p>
<p>"First you have to learn the alphabet."</p>
<p>"De A, B, C's?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, den, could I buy a primer off ye?" said David, pulling
out a well-worn purse. "De kind de littlest kids use."</p>
<p>"I haven't any to sell, but here's one I can lend you."</p>
<p>"T'anks, I'se 'll take good care of it."</p>
<p>"Here are the letters," said Mary, opening the book at the
first page. "You'll have to copy them over and over, till you
know them all thoroughly."</p>
<p>"But how does I know dere names?"</p>
<p>"I'll go over them, three or four times, with you now. The
first is A, that you know already, the second B, like a
bumblebee, the third C, like the sea, the ocean."</p>
<p>"Dey's a string o' dem, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Twenty-six," said Mary, "and after you've learned to make the
twenty-six big ones, there are twenty-six little ones. Copy them
over and over, and if you get stuck on the names or sounds, come
up any afternoon when school's out, and I'll help you. On the
next page are simple words with pictures: see, Rat, Cat, Dog.
When you've learned your letters, you can begin on these simple
words."</p>
<p>"I'se'll sure give her a good try," said David.</p>
<p>"Look here, I'll make a copy of your name and the names of the
boats. There it is, David Jung. Your boat is <i>Ph&oelig;be,</i>
isn't it? And Joseph's <i>Lettie,</i> Casper's <i>Gannet,</i> and
Martin's <i>Sea Gull."</i></p>
<p>David was much interested in this bit of applied learning.</p>
<p>"S'pose I kin larn?" he queried boyishly. "I got a baby, you
know; Anapest's raisin' him fur me. Some day he'll be a-comin' to
school."</p>
<p>"Of course you can learn. My dad says you've been high-line
fisherman of this bay for three years. A high-line fisherman can
learn anything. Fishing takes brains and judgment; of course you
can learn."</p>
<p>"I'se'll give her a try, hard as I fish," said David,
departing, the primer gripped in his big hand, hope clutching at
his heart.</p>
<p>At the kitchen table that very night he began his education.
As if in anticipation of a rough and dirty job, he rolled both
shirt sleeves high above his elbows, exposing his swelling
muscles. He got paper, a stub of pencil, opened his primer, and
after much squaring of elbows and puckering of brow, began to
copy the big letters straight down the list. These crooked signs
were mysterious to him; he felt as if he were learning magic. He
wondered what great man had invented them. "Perhaps," he thought,
"dey was a gift o' God to men, an' t'rough dem I kin find out
somethin' good." The letters seemed to him fixed, unchanged from
the beginning, inevitable. He little dreamed how they had been
battered about the world, from Egypt to Crete, from Crete to
Greece, from Greece to Rome, from Rome to barbarous Britain; a
hard line given by a long-faced Egyptian, a graceful curve by
some smiling Greek, a dignity of form by some pompous Roman, a
dot and quaint twirl by some mincing clerk of Britain.</p>
<p>From the wearisome task of writing the alphabet over and over,
he was led astray to copy the sheet Mary had made for him with
his own name and the names of the boats. "David Jung the
<i>Ph&oelig;be</i>," fifty times he wrote it, till his conscience
pricked him, for it seemed hardly fair to take up advanced work
till he had conquered the straight and crooked letters.</p>
<p>At his right elbow, as he worked, stood a paraffin lamp with a
mantle that cast a glaring white light upon table and floor and
made mocking shadows dance on the ceiling. The lamp had a
history. David had bought it from a preacher, not a regular
preacher, but a kind of missionary or aquatic circuit rider, who
had spiritual jurisdiction over the outer islands. The grasping
islanders were willing to pay little in money for their chance of
salvation, and the poor preacher was driven to selling them
patent lamps to eke out a slender income. David, whom Gershom had
taught to be a kind of agnostic, had no great regard for the
words of the preacher, but one day, when the stout little man had
come through a rough sea to visit a sick woman and baptize a girl
of the Jungs and received but seventy cents in the collection
plate, he had issued from the fish house and said: "Hi, there,
parson, I wants one o' yur lamps," and to the deep disgust of
Uriah and the brothers had handed over seven dollars to the man
of God.</p>
<p>Every evening, by the light of his glaring patent lamp, David
laboured away, and felt more tired at the end of two hours'
wrestling with the alphabet than if he had spent that time in
hauling heavy lobster pots in a rough sea. Still, he realized
that it took his mind off the quarrels of the island, the greed
of Uriah, the hatefulness of the brothers, and his own
loneliness. He was spurred on, too, by a desire to exhibit his
learning some day before Gershom. Sometimes he sat biting the end
of his stubby pencil and dreaming of what he could do. Next year
he would begin to take the Liscomb paper and learn what the world
did from day to day and when little Ralph was grown, he could
hold him on his knees and teach the child all he had learned. He
made frequent afternoon visits to the schoolhouse to consult the
oracle in regard to the sounds and shaping of letters. Uriah
noted this and wagged his old beard. Already he had begun to
think that Mary might make a useful wife for Casper, and that
something in the way of dowry might be squeezed out of old Jean
Dauphiny.</p>
<p>But not only did David work at learning in the kitchen. When
he steered for the banks in gray dawns, the primer lay snugly
tucked in a pocket beneath his oilskins. When he stopped fishing
to eat his lunch, or if there came a period when, because of the
run of tide, cod would not bite, out would come his precious book
for a review of cat, dog, rat. Tailor-wise this scholar at the
beginning of things squatted upon his bit of sun-touched deck and
by turns frowned and smiled upon his book. In part, it had taken
the place of Gershom, his old fishing comrade. Sometimes, as he
steered for home, he held tiller in one hand and primer in the
other, glancing up from the magic symbols to catch beneath his
main boom a quick glimpse of Rockbound or Barren Island. Once,
when so engaged, he jibbed the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> before a
following wind and carried away a back stay. Then his eye swiftly
circled the sea to ascertain if any fisherman had noted his
boat's misdemeanour--for to jib a running boat is a matter for
great scorn among fishermen--and judging that no Jung or Kraus
had seen looked down again and, smiling, patted his book.</p>
<p>One Sunday, as he sat by his boat at the launch's head looking
across the sea to the Outposts, Mary, who had been making the
round of the island, came up to him. Her cheeks were glowing in
the sea wind, which made the red tassel of her cap stand out
stiffly and then dance and bob.</p>
<p>"She's like none I've seen before," thought David sadly.</p>
<p>"How are you getting on with your lessons, high-line
fisherman?" she asked gaily.</p>
<p>"Poor," answered David. "I guess I'se dumb at books."</p>
<p>"It's always harder to learn when you re grown up."</p>
<p>"Ay dat it is. De trouble is, I doesn't rightly know when I'se
right an' when I'se wrong."</p>
<p>"Look here," said Mary suddenly. "I'm teaching Fanny to read
and write in the evenings. Why couldn't I teach the two of you
together?"</p>
<p>David's heart gave a great throb of joy, and Mary would have
been astonished could she have sensed the flood of generous and
grateful thoughts that, at her offer, flowed through the mind of
that simple man, who had had few favours in life but had won his
little all by hard fighting.</p>
<p>"Dat would be great," he gasped, scarce able to speak for joy.
"But I kin pay, I don't want ye to do it fur nuttin'."</p>
<p>"Never mind pay. You can do me a favour in return. Some day I
may want to go to Bay of God's Mercy, and you can take me in the
<i>Ph&oelig;be."</i></p>
<p>"Dat I'se'll gladly do, an' as often as ye likes."</p>
<p>"All right, I'll come up to your house--it's too noisy in
Christian's--three nights a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays, and bring Fanny along with me."</p>
<p>Thus the winter night class was begun. David's kitchen stove,
stuffed with spruce knots, glowed, the patent lamp cast its
glaring light, in the distance the sea grumbled along the beach.
Fanny, the potato girl, clad in clean blue-checked gingham, her
wistful blue eyes shining gratefully, and David, brawny
high-liner, sat on one side of the kitchen table, and like two
little children conned their lessons from the <i>First Royal
Reader.</i> Mary sat on the other side and, with the zeal of a
young teacher, checked or encouraged them, as the occasion
demanded. If, for instance, David spelled out painfully the story
of brave Bobby and his gallant rescue of the child from the
ravenous shark and commented in passing: "Dat's plum
foolishness--a dog in de water ain't got no show wid a shark."
Then Mary would rebuke him sharply as if he were a little boy:
"Now, David Jung, your business is not to tell me what a dog or a
shark can do in the water. Perhaps you do know more about codfish
and sharks and dogs in the water than the man who wrote this
story. That doesn't help much with your reading: your business is
to know the words 'dog' and 'shark' when you come to them in
print. And what's more, you and Fanny have got to stop saying
'wid' and 'dat.'" And Mary put her tongue between her closed
teeth and showed them how to say "th." "Just as if you were going
to spit and changed your mind," she explained concisely.</p>
<p>Then David and Fanny each had to say "that" and "with" fifty
times with much spluttering, spitting, and suppressed laughter,
before they were allowed to go back to the story of brave Bobby
and the shark, which David still read with a cynical twist in the
corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>After the lessons David walked home with Fanny and Mary. Fanny
they dropped at the old loft house; with Mary alone he had a
hundred yards across the stubble field to the home of Christian
Kraus, where Mary boarded. David walked as slowly as he dared, to
make those precious moments last as long as possible. Sometimes
they looked out across the sea to the flash of Gershom's light
and spoke of his loneliness; sometimes they looked up at the
burning stars, and Mary told him the names of the constellations:
the Pleiades, Orion, Cassiopea's Chair, the Great Bear, which,
though formerly nameless to him, he had noted through a thousand
nights.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that David should fall in love with Mary,
for he was lonely, and by instinct his heart responded to
gentleness and beauty. He had no desire to handle her, as he had
handled other women; he desired only to be near her as a
worshipper and to drink in her wisdom and beauty. Her words were
balm to his troubled mind. He gave her the loyalty and affection
that a dog of the Rockland breed gives his master. He had dreamed
of no one who approached her perfection; she seemed the acme of
wisdom and beauty. Tamar and Leah had been but women; Mary was
something apart.</p>
<p>But he was wise enough to keep his feelings to himself. He
knew the strict tradition and convention of the islanders, who,
while they paid little heed to morals and regarded love children
with slight disapproval, had somehow fixed on a two-year period
of widowership before a man could begin to court another woman in
honourable fashion. "Perhaps," thought David, "at the end of two
years, I might ask her." But surely it was arrogant to think of
asking anyone so far above him.</p>
<p>But David was not Mary's only lover. It was obvious that such
a pretty and clever girl as Mary Dauphiny would be courted by the
single men of Rockbound and the neighbouring islands. Uriah had,
in fact, picked her out as a suitable wife for Casper. He
detested Casper and merely wished to marry him well because he
was a Jung, who should beget a brood of children who in time
could work and outdo the Krauses. "She kin read an' write," he
thought, "an' kin keep some books fur us. Dat'll keep de boys
from wranglin' so much at de end o' de season. It's gittin' hard
fur me to remember eberty'ing t'rough a whole month. She's a
stout lass an' kin lend a good hand wid de fish when we'se
pinched, an' after she's married, she kin keep right on teachin'
school jus' de same, an' any money Christian Kraus collects will
be turned ober to us in de end."</p>
<p>This last thought pleased the old king so much that he
chuckled and rubbed his hands through his beard. Uriah broached
the proposal to Casper and began to urge him on. In fact, Casper
needed little urging, for his narrow, greedy eyes had followed
Mary since the day of her landing on the island.</p>
<p>David hardly feared Casper as a rival, yet the fellow became a
source of annoyance, for he used to come hanging about David's
house on lesson nights to take Mary home. Along toward half-past
eight, in the midst of their lessons, the red-faced Casper would
arrive clad in his Sunday suit. If it were mild, he stayed
without, whistling and stamping his feet on the doorstep, but if
it were bitter cold he would, perforce, enter the kitchen and sit
scowling at David and Fanny till the lesson was over. He could
not comprehend, as he sat there, why Mary bothered with such low
trash. Fanny's record was patent to every soul on Rockbound, and
many a time he'd heard the Outposters graphically describe David
and Gershom as "hellians fur women." "He knows not a scrap o' de
Bible," he thought, forgetting that he himself derided the Old
Testament. "Look what he done to my sister Tamar. If I was de
Lord God, I'd wipe dat David an' his bully Gershom Born right off
de eart'. A fine friend, birds o' a feather, a drunken
whoremaster, dat's what I calls him. As fur David, nuttin' would
do my eyes so much good as to see de <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> come
round West Head bottom up. I wish she'd sarve him as she sarved
Mark."</p>
<p>So he sat by the stove, patiently waiting for Mary and
mingling his ugly thoughts with reflections on his own virtues
and his ever-growing wealth. When Mary glanced his way, and that
was but seldom, he quickly changed his lowering scowl into an
ingratiating grin. The four walked down the lane together as far
as the fish house; then David stood alone, cursing softly but
none the less bitterly as he watched Casper and Mary across the
fields to Christian's house.</p>
<p>But Casper was the lesser of David's rivals, for Gershom Born
fell in love with Mary too, and on every possible day drove his
boat on some pretext to Rockbound to see her and perhaps have a
word with her. Casper and Uriah had many a conference about
Gershom in a dark corner of the fish house. Casper was all for
denying Gershom the right to land his boat on their launch. But
Uriah said, no, that could not be done; Gershom had been too long
their sharesman, and such a denial was against the custom of the
islands. The old man disliked Gershom but feared his bitter
tongue and the opinions of the fishermen in the bay. Moreover, as
Uriah pointed out, Gershom could land on the Krauses' land and
see Mary in spite of them. The Krauses would be glad to aid
Gershom in anything against the Jungs. Sometimes Uriah would turn
fiercely on Casper with: "Why doesn't ye take de woman if ye
wants her? I never let no man stan' in my way wid a woman when I
was young. Ye'd do de same if ye had de spunk o' a louse. If dat
David or Gershom gits her away from ye, ye kin git to hell off my
island."</p>
<p>When Casper attempted to point out that Mary Dauphiny was
different from the women Uriah had dealt with in the days of his
youth, the old man's eyes blazed with fury. "Women, women," he
muttered, "dey's all alike. Trouble is de men's too like women,
now'days. When I were a gaffer, men what was real men took what
dey wanted."</p>
<p>David felt that he could easily compete with Casper as a
rival--the Jungs would hate him if he won her from Casper; that
mattered little since their hatred was already bitter--but when
Gershom Born entered the lists as Mary's apparent suitor, hope
sank low in his heart. One Sunday afternoon he walked to the
southern cliff top. He carried his long-barrelled duck gun, and
his dog followed close to his heels, but though a flock of
blue-wings sheltered from the sea in Southwest Gutter within easy
range, he fired no shot. The cranberry vines were covered deep in
crusted snow. He stamped a place clear, brushed off a log, and
sat down to think, his dog curled at his feet. Below him was the
angry winter sea, its black surface checkered with floating ice.
Far off to the southward stood up Gershom's lonely tower. His
peace of mind had been of brief duration. Now he was plagued with
an aching love for Mary, yet he must stand aside while others
wooed her. He dared not ask her for almost two years, and who
knew what might happen in that time? How could he wait so long?
Against Casper he knew he had a good fighting chance, for while
Casper was backed by the wealthy Uriah, he was so cowardly and
mean spirited that David felt a clever and sensitive girl like
Mary would quickly see through him. Yet you never could tell what
women would think or do; they were as sharp as fine steel in some
things and dull as blunted tools in their judgment of men.</p>
<p>But Gershom as a rival! Gershom was another matter! Gershom,
keeper of the great light; Gershom, son of old Gershom Born, wise
man of the islands; Gershom, who read poetry books and could
himself make and sing ballads; Gershom, who had never needed
marriage, since he carried women off their feet and won whom he
chose; Gershom, the giant with ready wit, handsome face, and
great booming voice. Above all, Gershom was his friend, his sworn
ally, who had stood shoulder to shoulder with him in a dozen
fights. He could hardly enter the race against Gershom, and if he
did, what would be his chances? Life was vexatious, he wished he
were through with it, and he groaned so deeply that the dog
started up and looked into his master's eyes with wonder. Again
his eyes crossed the sea to the stark loneliness of Barren
Island. Surely Gershom, on that ghost-ridden place, needed a wife
more than he. But who can give a lover any law? His reasoning,
his intense affection for his friend, could not lessen his love
for Mary Dauphiny nor lay the sorrow in his heart.</p>
<p>Rockbound promised him no peace of mind nor quiet of heart;
the tiresome procession of years that stretched before him
offered endless labour but no striving for a goal that seemed
worthy of attainment. For a moment he stood struggling with the
temptation to throw himself over the cliff into the dog hole and
let ice and sea batter him to pieces. But a thought of little
Ralph and of his vow to Tamar held him back. The child must not
grow up a landless man and spend his best years winning freedom.
He must learn to endure and wait in silence, though life was
hopeless and impossible. Men were as cold and cruel as the winter
sea that crashed the ice against the cliffs and roared into the
cannon rock to send up mocking cries.</p>

<p>After his decision on the cliff, the night lessons became
painful things to David. He scarcely dared glance up from his
book to meet Mary's brown eyes. Though he had learned a great
deal, he suddenly lost interest in reading; the magic symbols had
brought him no happiness but only further discomfort. He loathed
the smug Casper, who lounged in silence by the stove, and was
glad when the lobster season, with its attendant work by day and
night, gave an excuse for the suspension of learning.</p>
<p>David was able to set about lobstering early, for it had been
an open winter, with the bay unclogged with floes, which
sometimes in intense and sudden frost knit the islands to the
main. He had a better season than any man on Rockbound; when it
was time to haul his traps and go after mackerel, he was some
four hundred dollars richer, but his heart was low, and success
brought him little happiness.</p>
<p>With the advent of spring, Uriah began to rush and hustle his
underlings. Age could not break the old man's spirit, nor time
deplete his energy or lessen his desire for gain. Spring, summer,
and early autumn were seasons of heartbreaking labour, in which
Uriah gloried. Season after season the mackerel advanced north in
myriads like an invading horde, following the indentations of the
coast, in the same invariable fashion as those that spawned them
had done. La Tuque Bay they passed for no apparent reason,
schooled into St. Michael's Bay, and there rushed into hundreds
of traps and seines set to receive them. All night during the
mackerel season, watchmen of the Jungs sat and dozed fitfully, by
tiny fires on the cliff tops, and, waking, stared for flash of
white foam on black water, that betokened schooling fish in the
seine. With the seine full came the labour of getting the fish
out, boating them to the fish house, and dressing them. The
fish-house floor was piled ever higher, and men staggered to and
fro, drunken through loss of sleep. When the mackerel passed
north, came the haddock and the attendant labour of setting and
hauling heavy trawls. If halibut were taken on the trawls, a long
night journey to Minden, to market the fish fresh, was involved.
Endless fields of potatoes and cabbages had somehow to be planted
at odd moments of this busy season. The women could not do the
heaviest of this work. In the midst of cutting the timothy came
the herring close inshore, and codfish were always with them.
When in the cool breezes of September the cod must be dried on
rock and fish flake, the mackerel retreated southward from the
arctic waters. Boats must be repaired, caulked, and painted, nets
tanned, gear overhauled, and then winter leaped upon them.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that David, restless and unhappy, looked
forward to such a programme with a sinking heart. For Mary, he
could have endured endless labour; without her, nothing seemed
good in his eyes. The sight of Gershom and her together pierced
like an arrow to his heart. If he could but escape for this
spring and summer this prison of slave labour and unrequited
love! But there was no hope in his heart. Escape, however, was
closer than he thought.</p>
<p>In late April a boat from the main brought Uriah a letter,
which he carried home to his wife for an interpretation. It was
from Captain Johnny Westner, asking Uriah to let two of his boys
go to the Grand Banks on the <i>Sylvia Westner.</i> Since the
<i>Sylvia Westner</i> had been for three seasons high-line of all
the Liscomb fleet, and first home, her decks kenched high with
cod, this invitation was something of a compliment, which pleased
the old man. Johnny Westner, smartest young skipper on all the
coast, picked only the most skilled hand-liners and ablest men
for his crews. The reputation of Rockbound had travelled far and
wide; none excelled Rockbound men with the hand-line, and long
stretches of work without sleep were meat and drink to them.</p>
<p>Now, with the exception of David, and that in the days when he
had eked out a slender existence on the Outposts, no Rockbound
man had ever sailed on a Grand Banker. To allow such a thing
might be to admit that Rockbound was not the best fishing stand
on the coast, and that was a matter of pride with Uriah. For
several days, as the old man sat mending nets in the loft, he
pondered over the proposal. Of course, it never occurred to him
to ask advice or opinion of anyone involved; he was the king, he
alone decided policies of importance.</p>
<p>To let two boys go would leave him short-handed for the
summer's work. Still, Joe's and Martin's oldest gaffers were big
enough now to give a hand in the boats. "Dis goin' to school an'
listenin' to a woman talk about words an' letters is all
flub-dub," thought the old man. "Make 'em soft an' weak. Let 'em
git inter de boats an' larn somethin' real, larn to be tough men,
way me an' George an' Simeon done." He could hire a couple of
cheap sharesmen from the main, and he and Joseph could drive them
to the limit for one season. If the <i>Sylvia Westner,</i> he
reasoned, made three trips and came home again high-line, a
sharesman on board would make twice as much money as anyone
fishing off Rockbound in the best season, for Grand Banks cod
were big and fetched a higher price than inshore fish. The money
thus got would be thrown into the common chest, and his would be
the lion's share. Upon this consideration Uriah ultimately based
his decision to send two of his vassals in accordance with
Captain Johnny's request.</p>
<p>He would gladly have sent the grumbling Casper, but was
restrained by two reasons: he had set Casper hot upon the trail
of Mary Dauphiny, and if Casper were on the Banks for a whole
season, Gershom Born, or even David, might get an advantage with
her; moreover, Casper was the most skilled and experienced in
shooting the seine, and he could not spare him in herring time.
David and Gershom would have been the perfect pair to send--then
Casper would have had a clear field for his love affair--but,
alas, Gershom was no longer a king's subject. Finally, the old
king elected to send David and Martin, his weakest linesman.</p>
<p>David sprang in the air, cracked his heels, and gave a great
whoop when Uriah told him. Uriah scowled disapproval in his
pleasure at the announcement, but David marked him not. His
prayer had been answered: here was a chance to escape for awhile
the turbulence of the island and the sight of Mary. Gershom, who
was on Rockbound at the time, gripped his hand and said, "Wisht I
could go wid." David's escape increased his own sense of irksome
imprisonment. He little guessed how he stung David when he added:
"Well, if I can't git away, I got to git a woman on Barren
Island, an' dat soon. It's too damn lonesome fur a man like me.
I'se 'll fergit how to speak now. Dat damn island'll kill me in
de end."</p>
<p>Uriah himself was to take Martin and David in his boat to the
La Tuque Islands and there deliver them in person to Hand-line
Johnny. Martin made no demur when the decision was announced to
him; he never resisted his father, and on the day before the
<i>Sylvia Westner</i> was to sail he said good-bye to wife and
children with a show of stoical indifference. David shook
Anapest's hand and charged her to take good care of little Ralph,
but he avoided saying a word of good-bye to Mary.</p>
<p>When he came down the path to the boat, however, dunnage bag,
rubber boots, and oilskins upon his broad shoulders, he found
Mary waiting near the parting boat's prow. Martin was already
aboard, stowing his kit; Uriah stood impatient to push off.</p>
<p>"Don't forget your lessons," said Mary as David drew near.
"Here's a book I've brought you to read," and she shoved into his
hand a battered and well-thumbed copy of <i>The Tempest</i> that
she had studied in school.</p>
<p>"Wid Johnny Westner, he won't have nair a time fur readin',"
interjected Uriah.</p>
<p>"Yes, he will; there's going and coming, when he'll have his
watch below, and Sundays. Take it, take it," she added, pressing
the book into David's hands. "It's all about a tempest, a
shipwreck, magic, and a pair of island lovers."</p>
<p>David took the book and stuck it in his pocket, but he was
dumb. He looked into Mary's eyes for what seemed an interminable
time, but his lips would not open to say either, "thank you" or
"good-bye."</p>
<p>Uriah broke the spell: "Git yur dunnage aboard quick, an' help
shove off dis boat. We ain't got all day fur startin'; it's a
right long sail to de La Tuque Islands."</p>
<p>Uriah and David slipped the boat off the launch, and Mary
walked to the top of Crook's Hill to wave good-bye till their
sail vanished behind the rocks of Little Duck. She surprised
herself in doing this: surely she was not in love with David
Jung; he was too recent a widower and must be put out of her
mind. "Perhaps," she thought, "I wanted to wave good-bye because
I'm a fisherman's daughter and understand the dangers they are
going to." In her heart she knew she would miss David from the
island.</p>
<p>The boat, with Uriah at the tiller and David and Martin
amidships, moved along quickly. David dozed, head on thwart, and
with a start awoke from a dream in which Uriah, as a pirate, was
selling him into slavery. Uriah spoke not a word to either of his
retainers. It was a long sail to the La Tuque Islands, but the
northeast land breeze on their quarter carried them along so
briskly that by noon they came within sight of Hand-line Johnny's
vessel.</p>
<p>She was a smart-looking schooner, painted gleaming black, with
a strip of scarlet along her scupper line from stem to stern.
Through the clear water, her coppered bottom glimmered, and below
her bowsprit was a gilded figurehead that some local artist had
carved as a semblance of the young master's little girl, for whom
the schooner was named. She had deep, graceful sheer, her spars
raked slightly aft, and with a couple of guns mounted bow and
stern she might easily have passed for a swift privateer such as
sailed those waters a hundred years before her time. With the
exception of the <i>Springwood,</i> she was the fastest of all
the Liscomb fleet. Both her top masts were stepped--something
unusual in a banker--her yellow dories were nested on deck, jibs
were flapping loose, the peak of the mainsail hoisted to dry, and
as the breeze yawed her to and fro on her cable, she seemed to
David as buoyant and supple as a gannet riding a wave.</p>
<p>They were soon alongside, and David, at Uriah's order,
hastened to put out a rope fender to guard the schooner's new
paint from their gunwale. Hand-line Johnny appeared at the rail
above them to shout a greeting. He was as smart as his schooner.
Although only twenty-five years of age, he was known from Cape
Brule to Marmot as a fisherman of great skill and judgment, an
accurate navigator and bold sailing master. He dared carry on in
half gale, and his reputation for daring, combined with his youth
and strength, won for him the admiration and loyalty of his
crews. Sailors and fishermen swear by a master who will carry on
sail. Nothing warmed Captain Johnny's heart more than to have
both topsails bellying and the lee rail under.</p>
<p>David and Martin climbed aboard and carried their dunnage to
the bunks assigned them in the forecastle. Uriah, after a second
invitation, came on deck to have a moment's crack with Captain
Johnny, who was a man after his own heart. "Dat David'll bear
some drivin'," he confided to the young master. Then, waving his
hand to Martin and David, he clambered over the side to beat his
way back to Rockbound alone, a weary, long beat against a head
wind, one long leg to sea, one short leg back toward the land. If
the wind held from the northeast he might, he thought, make
Rockbound by midnight, but if it headed him off he would stand in
to Bay of God's Mercy and talk with Jean Dauphiny about Casper's
marriage with Mary. Jean Dauphiny had some money, he knew, and
should give dowry with his girl, as was the custom among people
of French descent along the coast. He must not scare the
Frenchman off by asking too much. The best plan would be to get
Dauphiny to name a sum and then demand a little more. The
grizzled old king smiled to himself, and speculated on dowry and
the amount of money David and Martin would bring to the common
chest in September, as his sharp old eyes peered under the main
boom and his sea-scarred hand steadied the kicking tiller. He had
no luck with the wind that day; it hauled farther to the eastward
and headed him off with squally puffs before he reached the
riotous Baker's Dozen. He came about on the landward tack and
stood in for the Bay of God's Mercy, to spend the night with the
Dauphinys.</p>
<p>In the evening Uriah and old Jean sat in the Dauphiny kitchen
and, over glasses of hot rum, talked of many things. Uriah
pretended that his visit was a chance and friendly one, made on
his way home from delivering David and Martin to the <i>Sylvia
Westner.</i> This statement was partly true, since Uriah would
have held on toward Rockbound had the wind not headed him, but
old Jean was not simple enough to believe that a driver like
Uriah Jung wasted his time in friendly visits when he had no ax
to grind.</p>
<p>After much talk of boats and fishing the astute Uriah led up
to his subject by praising Mary. In an unusual role of promoter
of Rockbound education, he told the fond father how well his
island subjects were pleased with Mary's teaching and general
conduct.</p>
<p>"Dat's one fine lass," said the astute Uriah.</p>
<p>"Dat she is," replied old Jean, swelling with pride. "Dere's
none like her on dis coast neider fur books nur work, an', hush,
man, has ye p'r'aps heard her play on de organ?"</p>
<p>"Dat I has."</p>
<p>"She kin sail a boat, too, as good as air a one o' yur
boys."</p>
<p>"Maybe, maybe," said Uriah, wagging his beard.</p>
<p>"One o' my boys, Casper, de eldest, has bin agoin' round
wid."</p>
<p>"Ay," rejoined old Jean, "dat's de way wid young folks. Ye
minds how we was, Ury, years ago, on de Outposts an' de main? Dem
was fine free days."</p>
<p>"Dat I 'members well. But times is changed, dey marries more
now. I reckon, Jean, dat when we was gaffers half de kids on de
islands was love kids."</p>
<p>"An' grand mens dey maked, too! Where's such mens
now'days?"</p>
<p>"Times is changed, times is changed. A man's got to have a
regular wife now by de time he's t'irty to look after house and
gear."</p>
<p>"Dat's right, but dey does rant round an' tie ye down," sighed
old Jean, thinking of his shrewish second.</p>
<p>"A good un saves house an' gear an' pays her way."</p>
<p>"Ay, dat she does!"</p>
<p>"Now, my boy Casper's come to de marryin' time. He's a strong
man, de first one I begot wid dis woman, an' dey're reckoned de
best. He's got house an' land an' money in de bank."</p>
<p>"Ay, Casper's an able man."</p>
<p>"He wants fur to marry yur Mary, if it kin be arranged betwixt
us."</p>
<p>"I reckons Mary won't t'ink o' marryin' fur many a year, her
mind's sot on bein' a high-line teacher."</p>
<p>"What you t'inks o' all dis studyin' books, Jean?"</p>
<p>"Mostly damn foolishness."</p>
<p>"Dat it is, 'less it helps a man keep books, an' see de
dealers don't cheat him an' weigh him short. Mary's got 'nought
larnin' fur dat now. What's de good o' dat fine lass dat kin bear
able men bein' an old maid school teacher?"</p>
<p>"Dere yur right, Ury."</p>
<p>"Let's settle it now, den."</p>
<p>So the old men drew their chairs closer together and mumbled
in low tones. They were both astute, but Uriah outdid Jean in
craft. Old Dauphiny was not unwilling that his Mary should marry
one of the rich Rockbound Jungs. In fact, he knew that no better
business match could be made on the whole coast. Uriah inflamed
old Jean's greed by dwelling on the richness of his island's
soil, its matchless position as a fishing stand, his wealth in
nets and boats and endless gear piled high in lofts. Casper was
his eldest son, dear to his heart, and some day would inherit
much. So persuasive was Uriah that toward midnight old Jean not
only consented but promised dowry. Not cash, of course, from the
chest hidden at the foot of the brown rafter--that was too
precious to be passed recklessly from hand to hand, but something
in the way of equipment, a deep herring seine and a thirty-foot
boat that was to be repainted and named the <i>Mary.</i> At
daybreak on the following morning, Uriah set out in his boat,
smiling grimly to himself at the thought of having overreached
Jean Dauphiny, and with a favouring breeze reached his island
kingdom before noon.</p>
<p>On the same morning the <i>Sylvia Westner</i> sailed, and
young Martin got his first extended view of the coast, a little
part of which he knew so well. He was young Martin in name only,
and so called to distinguish him from his uncle in Sanford. Young
Martin was not liked on board from the first. He was
close-mouthed, greedy at table, and had all the pride and
arrogance of the Rockbound Jungs. David, however, upon whom
Martin really relied for help and advice, soon became a
favourite. His bunk in the forecastle was narrow and cramping for
a man of his stature, but that mattered little to him, he was
inured to hard beds and by nature a sailor. There were
twenty-five men aboard, rigging and paint work were in
first-class repair, and the watches light. On the outward voyage
he had a two hours' trick at the wheel and the rest of the day to
himself.</p>
<p>On the second day of this outward voyage he found by the
capstan a snug corner, screened from the shrewd April wind, and
when he had made sure that no one was watching, pulled out the
book Mary had given him.</p>
<p>"Werses," he muttered as he turned the pages. "Dat's nuttin'
fur me. Werses is harder dan straight readin'." Still, the book
had Mary Dauphiny written on the flyleaf, and for her sake he
stumbled through the opening scenes. It was all about a ship in a
gale o' wind, passengers buttin' in, dough dey knew nought o'
boats and ships, about brave sailors doin' dere best, an' how at
last de ship struck an' split. Though he did not understand all
the words, his interest was awakened, and he read the opening
scene again with growing wonder. "Dey was a lee shore; dey tried
to come about an' missed stays; must er had too much forrad sail.
Den dey tried to wear ship, hadn't room, and struck. Dat's
exactly right; many's de wessel bin lost dat way. De feller what
wrote dem werses were a sailor and knowed ships an' de sea.
Caliban," he thought, "is like dat mischievous old ram o'
Gershom's. Miranda might be Mary. I wisht I could go back to
Rockbound a prince."</p>
<p>He had no time for reading verses when they reached the
southern bank, where Hand-line Johnny, with his usual run of good
luck, found great schools of cod. He loaded the <i>Sylvia
Westner</i> with everything he dared carry, and was back in
Liscomb from his spring trip in a little more than seven weeks.
Young Martin got a day off while the vessel was refitting,
visited his family, and carried Uriah their earnings, but David
stayed by the vessel.</p>
<p>Then the <i>Sylvia Westner</i> set out on her summer trip,
this time to fish the sandy banks to the southward of Sable
Island, where shifting channels give grudging passage through the
bars. Hand-line Johnny knew the ground well, and it was, of all
banks, his favourite. It seemed a marvellous place to David, who
could look over the side of his dory into deep green water, see
the schools of cod, watch them take the hook or scatter in terror
as the dark shadow of shark or albacore hung above them. Near
him, the <i>Sylvia Westner,</i> her black sides now scarred and
scrubbed by chaffing dories, yawed at her cable. The triangular
riding sail was set aft, to keep her head to the wind, and around
her, in a circle of a mile diameter, her yellow dories danced.
Just like an old hen with a flock of yellow chickens, he used to
think. When the fish were biting well, he could see captain,
cooks, and boys hauling the flashing cod over the vessel's rail.
No one idled on Hand-line Johnny's vessel, for he had a passion
for loading his schooner quickly, beating all records, and thus
proving to the world that hand-lining was a better method of
fishing than trawling. To establish this principle, which was,
perhaps, of as much value as principles that people accounted
more important try to establish, he spared neither himself nor
his crew.</p>
<p>On the midday summer sea the <i>Sylvia Westner,</i> encircled
by her dories and yawing under her riding sail, was a fine sight,
but when the long twilight began to fall, softening all lines,
she appeared to David romantic and beautiful. Then she was like a
pirate ship, with all the excitement and movement of battle.
Dories deep to the gunwale bumped alongside, forkfuls of fish
flew over the rail, unloaded dories tailed and elbowed astern,
the schooner's waist was a welter of slippery cod, splitters
flashed their knives by the flare of torches, boys dashed to and
fro to fetch and carry, salters sweated in the hold as the split
fish came tumbling down the hatchways. A babble of talk and
laughter mingled with the smack of fish on the splitting tables
and the splash in the washing butts. Hand-line Johnny led the
way, and everyone went at top speed. Little wonder he took a crew
of picked men! David's training on Rockbound stood him in good
stead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Thursday, August the fifth, though there was scarcely
enough wind to shake the leaves of the Lombardy poplars by
Uriah's house, long swells with a crest of white began to roll in
against the red cliffs of Rockbound. The islanders said to one
another that there had been a great storm somewhere at sea. On
Friday the sea increased, though only a gentle draught of wind
came out of the southeast. By Saturday night mountainous rollers
were smashing against the cliffs, filling the dog holes with
curdy foam and making the cannon rock spout high with the roar of
a big gun. Cranberry vines and wind-stunted spruces high on the
cliff's edge were flecked with flung spray and festooned with
kelp and seaweed.</p>
<p>The herring were on the shore, and though the sea was running
high, Jungs and Krauses, along with fishermen from the main, left
out their nets. Without a wind, they reasoned, a sea cannot keep
up, and on Saturday night the sea's surface for a mile to the
southward of Rockbound was checkered with lines of dancing
corks.</p>
<p>By nine of that Saturday night came the wind in a sudden gale
from the southeast with thunder and heavy gusts of rain. The
rainfall had been light on Rockbound that summer; Uriah's tank
was almost dry, and after the first squalls had washed the dust
from his roof the old man attached the pipes to the gutter, and
heard the water go gurgling into his cistern. He listened to the
sound, smiling with pleasure; it was grand to get something, even
water, for nothing. Then, as the southeaster whistled around his
eaves and swirled in the branches of the willows, he frowned as
dismal thoughts crossed his mind. "Good-bye, nets," he muttered.
"Dat'll take de edge off de lobster an' line-fish money. De boys
was dumb to set dem Friday, an' why is de Lord God so mean as to
send storms to destroy nets? Doesn't He know dey costs good
money!"</p>
<p>About twelve that night the wind hauled suddenly to the
northwest and blew a living gale off the shore; by Sunday morning
it was back again, blustering out of the southeast and driving
mountainous seas against the cliffs. The centre of the storm had
passed over Rockbound. By Sunday noon the storm had risen to the
height of its violence and begun to subside. It had come by slow
degrees but departed suddenly; by twilight only a moderate breeze
was blowing, by midnight the wind was stilled. Next morning the
islanders were able to visit their nets. The gale had taken a
heavy toll in the bay; of nets nothing but moorings, head ropes,
and handfuls of twine, was left; the Jungs lost eight fleets, the
Krauses five, and many a Sanford and Outpost man everything he
had. Ernest Bachman's big new boat went ashore in Deep Cove and
was smashed to kindling wood. Rockbound boats were saved, for
Jungs and Krauses had dragged them up until their prows were
across the roadway, and even there waves clutched at their
quarters and slopped the white of long breakers into them.</p>
<p>"You might 'a' knowed you'd 'a' lost dem," said Uriah to his
group of wet, dejected Rockbounders, who stood sadly
contemplating the tattered fragments of twine that clung to the
head ropes. "Me an' my brudder Simeon wouldn't 'a' set no new
fleets o' nets wid such a sea runnin' an' risin'. Us neber let no
nets lie out ober de Lord's Day. De anger o' de Lord were in dat
gale."</p>
<p>"Dere warn't no wind," ventured Casper sulkily.</p>
<p>"Do wind rip a net ur sea?" retorted the old king. "Us is
fishin' herrin', not sea gulls, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"My dad says, nothing venture, nothing have," said a woman's
clear voice in defence of the downcast fishermen.</p>
<p>Uriah wheeled sharply to see what woman had dared voice an
opinion on such an important matter, and finding it was Mary
Dauphiny who had spoken, his hard old face softened, and on one
of the few occasions in his life he made a semi-generous remark:
"I minds now, when I were a young man, I set two fleets o' nets
when de herrin' was aplenty an' los' dem all but de head ropes in
a risin' sea." And then he added with a note of triumph in his
voice: "De poor fellers on de Sanford main and de Outposts is de
ones dat 'll suffer; dey ain't got no more nets, an' us got
plenty in de loft."</p>
<p>"What's de matter wid de ole man?" muttered Joseph to himself.
"He mus' be gettin' soft in de head, or else he's up to some
game."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That great summer storm which harried Rockbound had its origin
in a rotating hurricane that whirled from the Caribbean Sea to
sweep the whole Atlantic coast. It drove past Rockbound and in
due time struck the <i>Sylvia Westner</i> as she lay riding to
the southward of Sable Island. Hand-line Johnny had no wireless
to warn him of approaching storms, but for several days he had
noted the barometer's fall, and felt in his bones that a great
storm was coming. Still, the fishing was good, the vessel almost
loaded; given another week, and he would be homeward bound, hold
full, and decks kenched high. Five miles to the north lay the
<i>Sadie Oxner,</i> out of Minden, a trawler, a dangerous rival
for his honours, and he vowed to himself to stay on the ground
longer than her master dared. At all costs, he must be home
earlier and with a bigger fare than the <i>Springwood,</i> the
<i>Nova Zembla,</i> or the <i>Sadie Oxner.</i></p>
<p>So Hand-line Johnny disregarded the strange windless waves,
daily increasing in length and height, and with two cables out
lay fifteen miles to the southward and in full view of that
treacherous crescent of rolling sand dunes, whose horns stretch
twenty miles to the westward and fourteen to the eastward, under
the green water. At night he saw the two lights, one on the
eastern, one on the western end of the giant sand pile, blink
warningly at him, and midway between them the dim glow of the
life-saving station.</p>
<p>When, in the early part of Saturday evening, the full force of
the southeast hurricane suddenly struck the <i>Sylvia
Westner,</i> her fish-laden dories were alongside, and those
empty trailed astern on their long painters. The ninety-mile gale
howled through the schooner's spars, and away went scraps and
patches of the riding sail torn from spar and boom. The <i>Sadie
Oxner</i> had long since slipped her cable and departed. Dories
had to be got aboard, nested, and lashed, hatch covers fitted and
battened down, cables keg-buoyed and cut--there was neither time
nor opportunity to get the anchors--foresail lashed down with
double stops, and away drove the <i>Sylvia Westner</i> under a
scrap of double-reefed inner staysail.</p>
<p>Hand-line Johnny and old Caleb Baker, his next-door neighbour
on the La Tuque Islands, held the wheel steady, though violent
blows of following seas almost tore the spokes from their hands.
David, whose trick it was by turn, stood behind them to render
assistance if needed. He had no fear in his heart, but gloried in
the fury of the gale. It was just like the tempest in his book of
verses, rain, wind, thunder, and a lee shore. Would Captain
Johnny, he wondered, try to bring her into the wind when close to
the bar, or would he wear ship and try the other tack? Either
plan would be hazardous. The wind tore the sou'wester from his
head and whirled it through the flying spume of the sea. Holding
fast to the main sheet, he stood bareheaded and smiling; this was
the stuff to drive from his mind thoughts of hopeless love.</p>
<p>Captain Johnny, as he steadied the wheel, knew that it was
impossible to haul the <i>Sylvia Westner</i> up in the wind and
heave her to; that meant setting the peak of the mainsail, and
that could not be considered in this roaring gale. To put her
even for a moment in the trough of that mountainous sea might
trip her, and even if the man&oelig;uvre were successful and he
hove her to, she would eventually drift ashore. No, the only
chance was to drive straight on before the gale. Darkness had
come, but the weather was clear, and he could see the blink of
the eastern light on his port bow. If he held his course he would
run over the middle of the eastern bar. The tide was at the top
of the flood, there were deep channels through the sand, perhaps
God would guide him to one; in moderate weather, he had run over
the bar many times before. As he dared not bring his vessel to
the wind, he could only make out as far as possible to the bar's
end without putting her in the trough of the sea. The
double-reefed staysail cracked, bellied, and tugged desperately
at sheet and halliard; if that went he must manage somehow to set
a corner of a jib.</p>
<p>Four men of the watch, young Martin among them, were on the
forward deck, lashed to stanchion or belaying pin, for the seas
swept her from stern to stem. As Martin clung fast to his
lashing, he bitterly resented the fact that his father had sent
him from his island home. Fishing from Rockbound was by
comparison safe; there was nothing like having solid ground
beneath your feet at night. Another time he would resist the old
man. He drove some fear from his mind by reckoning up his share
when the <i>Sylvia Westner</i> sold her fish in Liscomb. All the
other men of the crew were below in forecastle or afterhouse,
companionway and forecastle hatch closed tight; they could do no
good on deck and had boundless faith in the luck and skill of
their "old man" Hand-line Johnny.</p>
<p>Now the seas began to break short with a peculiar ragged
whiteness. "We're in shoal water near de bar," yelled Hand-line
Johnny to old Caleb Baker. "God give us luck dis night." Wind
furies shrieked, stays and halliards groaned with the straining
spars, piled dories tugged at their lashings, a water butt broke
loose and went booming along the deck to crash into the
forecastle hatch. A mountain of white water gathered behind the
<i>Sylvia Westner,</i> rose with slow, malicious dignity, and
crashed down upon her poop. David clung with arms and legs to the
main sheet, but both steersmen were dashed against the deckhouse.
Captain Johnny's right hand held fast the wheel spoke, but when
the sea washed clear and he staggered to his feet old Caleb Baker
was gone. At a sign from the young master David stepped forward
and took his place.</p>
<p>At that moment the <i>Sylvia Westner</i> struck; Hand-line
Johnny had no luck that night. All was over in the twinkling of
an eye. The vessel, deep-laden, was travelling at the rate of
twenty knots, and a tooth of black bottom rock whipped bottom and
keelson from her as cleanly as a boy with a sharp jackknife slits
a shaving from a pine stick. Two thousand quintals of split fish
and the unwetted salt dropped down upon the yellow sands; out
came the spars with a rending crash, and deck and upper hull
turned over. Within ten seconds of her striking, every man of the
crew was in the sea. Away they went, young Martin still lashed to
a bit of bulwark among them, poor scraps of humanity, weighed
down with soaked clothing and long boots; a flash of yellow
oilskins, hoarse cries that made no sound in the fierce tumult,
and they were gone. Some swam a stroke or two, some clung for an
instant to trailing rigging or broken dory, but few clung long in
that mad breaking sea.</p>
<p>David, as the sea engulfed him, caught the trailing end of a
dory's painter, whipped it twice around his body beneath the
armpits, and tied it fast with a double net hitch. Then, as a sea
drove the dory near him, he wormed his great right hand through
the loop, at the dory's stem, and let himself hang limply by the
wrist. He kicked off his rubber boots, tore loose the shoulder
straps of his oil pants, and wriggled his legs free. He gasped
for breath when his face was clear; he was bewildered but not
afraid. This was the Tempest without the saving magic. A pleasant
numbness beginning at his feet stole over him. He saw Gershom,
half naked in the rockweed, cursing the triumphant ram on the
cliff's edge above him, and almost laughed . . . his back
doorstep was sagging, he must put a beach rock under it when he
got home . . . perhaps a new sill . . . he had a piece of spruce
in his building that would do . . . Jennie Run-over chased him
with a stick to make him hurry with the wood, and the load was
more than his right arm could bear. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Uriah walked along the bar of sou'west cove to see
what harm the storm had done his island. Big seas were still
running violently against the red cliffs; the beach was strewn
with marine plants and mollusks from the sea floor. Deep-water
mussels, torn from their tough moorings, were scattered by
thousands in beds of rose-coloured sea moss. Upon rock and sand
lay tons of eel grass, rockweed, and long streamers of
broad-leafed kelp. Uriah looked with delight upon these piles of
sea dung. When rotted and spread it would give growing power to
his Rockbound soil. "Dere's nuttin'," he thought, "like rotten
sea dung, 'specially kelp, mixed wid barn manure, fur forcin'
cabbage. If de nets is gone, we got dis."</p>
<p>As he stood there, Casper and Joseph came running across the
island toward the beach.</p>
<p>"De <i>Sylvia Westners</i> lost wid all hands," Joseph
shouted. "An' de <i>Sadie Oxner,</i> too." News of disaster
travels fast in the islands.</p>
<p>"Is it sure true? How come ye hear?" asked the old man.</p>
<p>"Alan Slaughenwhite's boat jus' brung de word from de
main."</p>
<p>Uriah turned from them and said nothing. For some five minutes
he gazed seaward, his eyes shifting from the rolling waves and
misty horizon to the big piles of kelp upon the shore. Suddenly
he twirled on his heel and shouted savagely at Casper and
Joseph:</p>
<p>"What fur ye stand idlin' here? Wessels is always lost, boats
is always lost--ain't dat our life? Now, wid Martin an' David
gone, ye'll have to drive harder an' work like real mens. Go yoke
up de cattle an' haul off dis sea dung what de Lord sent us 'fore
it git mixed up wid sand an' too heavy fur to fork."</p>

<p>The roaring southeaster drove the dory, to which David was
lashed, shoreward. Life guards, who had seen the last flicker of
the <i>Sylvia Westners</i> lights, patrolled the beaches through
the night, and one caught a glimpse of yellow dory in the white
water. Wading into the surf waist deep, they dragged it ashore.
To their astonishment a man was fast to the painter, his right
hand, black and cruelly swollen, wedged in the dory's loop. They
cut the ropes clear, carried him beyond the reach of breakers
that yelled for their prey, and laid him in the lee of a steep
sand dune. There they built a fire of driftwood, cut his soaked
clothing from him, and wrapped him in warm wool blankets. His
right arm, broken above the elbow by the barging of the sodden
dory in the surf, hung limp and distorted. He seemed dead as a
stone. Still, as there was some warmth in his body, they prized
open his clenched teeth and poured brandy in his mouth. They
pulled his tongue forward, jerked the sea water from him, and by
relays inflated and deflated his lungs by a mechanical process.
Yes, there was a flicker of life in him. They strove to restore
him with all their vigour, so careful are men of life nigh lost,
so careless of it in full flush. When breathing was restored they
carried him on a stretcher to the life-saving station and laid
him in a warm bed.</p>
<p>The name on the dory told them the name of the vessel lost,
but there was nothing in David's clothing to identify him save a
sea-soaked book on the flyleaf of which appeared the name
Dauphiny. "One o' dem Dauphinys down La Tuque way," they
conjectured, and sent word to the main that the <i>Sylvia
Westner</i> had been lost, and a man named Dauphiny washed
ashore, living. It was only at the end of two days that David was
able to whisper: "I'se David Jung from Rockbound."</p>
<p>The government cutter fetched a doctor from the main, who
withdrew the sharp bone from the torn muscles and set the
compound fracture. He shook his head gravely over the chafed and
blackened forearm as he watched by David through days and nights.
"Blood poisoning," he said. "Best amputate, best cut the arm off
and save his life."</p>
<p>But David, who overheard, settled that argument: "No, I'se 'll
die wid my arm on if I has to; dere's no place fur a one-armed
man on Rockbound."</p>
<p>For a time it seemed impossible that he could live, but he was
well nursed by doctor and guardsmen, and his vitality and giant
strength prevailed. Destiny turned an upward thumb; he had yet
something to endure and accomplish in the world. Dull blacks and
ugly purples in his forearm turned to healthy pinks. He began to
eat and drink--how good cold water tasted--and to have some
interest in living. One day he asked for his book and turned over
the sea-stained pages detached from the broken cover.</p>
<p>"Dem poets is de bunk," he said grinning at the tattered
volume. "Dere ain't no magic nur enchanted islands! But de feller
what wrote it knowed what a tempest was, jus' de same."</p>
<p>When he was strong enough the cutter took him to the main, and
by easy stages he worked his way to Sanford, and from there a
friend's boat carried him to Rockbound. He approached the island
on a lowering autumn afternoon, his heart as low as on the day he
had first landed in his salvaged dory. As he had rested for a few
days in Sanford and the news of his advent had reached the island
before him, all Rockbound was on the launch as his boat's prow
took the logs. Joseph offered a shoulder to help him from the
gunwale, but David shook his head. "No, t'anks," he said. "I
still got my left arm and no dunnage wid." Uriah, Casper, and the
Jung women spoke no word of greeting, but stared at him
reproachfully, as if he had murdered young Martin. "Ye can't
drown dat David," thought Uriah. "Why does dis bad penny turn up
an' my boy Martin gone?" But Mary Dauphiny stepped forward with
glowing eyes and, seizing his left hand in both hers, cried:
"Welcome home, David Jung, welcome home! We're glad the sea
spared you."</p>
<p>David looked at her with singular equanimity. In his struggle
with death, in the wash of the sea, he had seen reality stripped
bare and caught a glimpse of the heart of things.</p>
<p>"I seen de Tempest all right," he said grinning at her.</p>
<p>Then he turned sharply on Uriah. "You guv me no greetin', an'
I takes it I'se not welcome. I'se sorry young Martin's gone, but
I could do naught to help him, nor air anoder man. 'Twas no wish
nor fault o' mine dat de sea drove me ashore."</p>
<p>Then Anapest began to cry and pushed forward with tears
trickling down her wrinkled brown face. "You is welcome, David,
you is welcome from bein' washed to and fro in de cruel sea. Yur
boy's well an' hearty, an' it's come an' stay wid, ye will, in my
house, till ye gits yur stren'th back." So David went across the
fields to Anapest's house, the old woman's arm about him.</p>
<p>Anapest kept him at her house for some weeks and dressed his
arm daily. From the first he was able to make the round of the
island, and on such walks he frequently met Uriah. There was
always the same query from the old king, the same reply from
David: "When is ye comin' back to work? We'se short-handed
now--ain't dat arm healed yit?"</p>
<p>"No, it ain't healed yit. De Doctor said I could do nair a
stroke o' work till spring. I'se 'll let ye know when I'se fit to
work."</p>
<p>But he was less worried during this period by Uriah's nagging
than by the bewildered state of Mary's mind. She came almost
daily to Anapest's house to talk with him; she had a troubled
look and had lost the serenity that had been such an important
part of her charm. Seeing her distress, he lost all the ground he
had gained and fell more hopelessly in love with her than before.
He could not fathom her trouble, for he was ignorant of many
things that had happened in his absence.</p>
<p>This was Mary's second year of teaching on Rockbound. Though
she had been offered better schools on the main at higher rates
of pay, some irresistible attraction, which she herself could not
understand, had drawn her back to the island. The summer she had
spent with her father in Bay of God's Mercy, and as they had
laboured together at fish flake or in hayfield, he had pressed
the suit of Casper Jung upon her. Yet he had not done this
tactlessly nor without cunning. The burden of his talk was:
Casper is safe, Casper is the eldest living son, and when Uriah
dies, he will be the richest man in the islands. Mary used to
defend herself by replying that she did not want to marry for
ever so long, that she must first make her mark as a teacher.</p>
<p>"An' when ye've made yur mark as a teacher, what den?" old
Jean used to rejoin. "Does ye want to be an old maid an' wither
up? No, a healthy lass like ye ought to have a man an' kids.
Marriage is de t'ing fur ye, my girl."</p>
<p>One day Mary, goaded beyond endurance, had said to her father:
"I don't want to marry now, but if I must, why not David Jung or
Gershom Born?"</p>
<p>"David Jung's jus' lost his wife a year gone, ye can't t'ink
on him. Besides, he's got naught but a sliver o' land an' no gear
to speak on. Why marry a poor man when ye kin git a rich one an'
eberyt'ing to yur hand? As fur Gershom Born, he's a strong man,
but he's too foolish bold. He'd have a woman in a steady stew an'
fotch her a peck o' trouble. How many times has he had boats
ashore or upsot dem after drinkin' in Liscomb? Onct he had to
swim half a mile to de Outposts an' landed wid one foot froze,
an' de women was afeerd to let him in dere houses wid de men
away, so bad was de fame o' him. An' what's life on Barren Island
fur a woman? No, Gershom Born's no man fur a wife. Take Casper,
he's safe, he's got house an' land an' money in de Liscomb bank,
an' more he'll have when de old man dies."</p>
<p>So in early September, Mary had come back to teach in the
Rockbound school with a troubled mind. In that primitive
community a father's wish in regard to a suitable husband was
almost an order that must be obeyed, though the fact that she was
earning her own living allowed her in some small measure to
escape his whole mandatory influence. One part of old Jean's
argument had struck home: it was better to marry and bear
children than to remain single and become the best of teachers.
She loved little children; perhaps nothing in life was finer than
to bear children to some of these great-limbed fishermen. She
even sympathized with Fanny's point of view.</p>
<p>She tried hard to obey her father and like Casper, and
sometimes of a Sunday walked the round of the island with him.
But she could not think of him as a lover; something mean and
calculating in Casper's nature pushed her away from him. He was
never quite himself, his artificial smile, a mere wrinkling of
the lips, faded when no one was looking, his laugh was hollow and
insincere. Why had not her father chosen David for her? Almost
daily she sought his company and talked with him as he lay on
Anapest's kitchen sofa. Yes, he was the best to talk with. Over
and over she made him tell her the story of the storm and the
loss of the <i>Sylvia Westner.</i> Her imagination exalted the
tale into an epic. Their former relations were reversed: she was
no longer the teacher but the learner. She asked for the tales of
the islands and of Gershom, but there were few of these that
could be told a woman. Those few David related with a quaint
humour, and Mary watched his sly eyes twinkle and the corners of
his mouth twitch in the shadow of a smile. Yes, it was tedious of
her father not to have chosen David.</p>
<p>These visits of Mary's were not matters of pure joy for David.
Hardship and suffering had taught him restraint, but one day,
when she left him, he groaned so deeply that Anapest came running
in with: "Is dat arm hurtin' ye so bad to-day? Here, I'se 'll put
a new dressin' on it."</p>
<p>But it was Gershom who eventually became Mary's accepted
lover. Marriage and children she had decided upon--the rhythm of
the sea has a magic effect upon women--and if she could not have
David the widower, Gershom the giant was vastly preferable to
Casper. True, she would invoke her father's anger, but she could
not take Casper nor, unmarried, endure another summer of the old
man's nagging.</p>
<p>From Anapest's kitchen window David daily saw Gershom's boat
make the launch and his great figure stride up the logs and along
the lane to spend the noon hour with Mary. Then David suffered.
When the bell called the children to afternoon school Gershom
would come to Anapest's house to visit his friend and, if they
were alone, to talk of Mary. As Gershom recounted the progress of
his courtship David's heart burned within him. Sometimes he
feared that his friend would see the pain in his face, and he
would turn away from Gershom, under the pretext that it eased his
arm to turn toward the window. From these conversations with
Gershom, who opened all his heart to his friend, from Mary's
furtive remarks, from the memory of a thousand commonplaces, a
glance, an attitude, a movement of the hand, David, by reflection
in later life, was able to piece together the fragments of their
tragic story, in which he was by turn actor, unheeded prompter, a
mute and disregarded spectator.</p>
<p>Certainly Gershom was madly in love with Mary. Old Gershom
Born had made it a rule to stay on his island when the Bull was
breaking, but in that autumn of his courtship young Gershom used
to push off on days when the furious Bull snorted columns of
spray heavenward. Giant-strong, he could alone turn his boat on
the ways and point her seaward; then, with staring blue eyes, he
used to study the seas; usually three big rollers came together,
smashing into the rock cleft and rattling the beach rocks. These
three, he knew, would be followed by lesser waves, and when the
third big roller had spent its violence he used to launch his
boat with catlike quickness into the swirling undertow. A great
push from the last log, a swift leap over the gunwale, and he
seized an oar to fend her off the cliffs and work her clear of
the passage; a swift dart astern, and he started the engine he
had primed and tried on the launch. When clear of the breakers on
the open sea, he used to stand gripping the tiller, his eager
eyes sweeping the red cliffs of Rockbound. He always steered for
the eastern end, round Lynch's Hole and Whale Cove, where he
remembered having seen, as a boy, flaring torches by night as the
islanders tore strips of blubber from a stranded whale, for by
this eastern route he came more quickly near Mary, who sat
teaching the children in her one-roomed schoolhouse.</p>
<p>Mary, in truth, used to look forward to Gershom's coming as a
relief against the pressing attentions of Casper. In vain Uriah
stamped his feet in the fish house and cursed his laggard son
whenever he heard Gershom's prow take the logs of the launch.
Casper could make no progress with his love affairs. Mary would
hurry through her lunch and walk with Gershom through the wood to
the eastern end, where, at the foot of an old stargon, they used
to sit on the soft matting of crowberry vines that grew along the
cliff's edge. Below them a giant symphony of seas came roaring
in; before them, the ocean stretched to a misty infinity.</p>
<p>One morning in November, when Gershom launched his boat into
the surf, he felt a strange sinking at heart. He tried to make
himself believe that his depression was caused by his having
eaten too heartily of corned herring, and by having forgotten, in
his haste to be off, his morning draught of rum, but in his heart
he knew that it was because the tingling nip in the air told him
that winter was close at hand. Winter, when he could see Mary but
seldom, while Casper could be with her daily! Winter, that meant
biting cold, ice, mountainous seas, and, worst of all, thick
mists and driving snow.</p>
<p>Every fisherman has something that he fears; for Gershom it
was fog or snow that shut out his landmarks. Uriah used to say of
him scornfully: "He's a blind man come fog or snow." Now, David
or Joseph could drive their boats through fog straight as homing
birds and slow down their engines to hear the roar of Rockbound
surf, but Gershom was always in a panic when fog or snow shut
down around him. Twice during old Gershom's lifetime he had
started from Liscomb, salt laden--true he had had a few friendly
drinks in Maurer's bar--missed Barren Island in the snow, and in
a lost man's panic stood in for the main. Once, sleep-drunk, he
ran his boat high and dry on the sand above Sou'west Gutter. Let
him but catch, through rifts, glimpses of rock, tree, or fish
house, and he could thread his way among the three hundred
islands, and their thrice three hundred shoals, but with the
blanket of gray came panic. He had little or no confidence in the
box compass that lay under his amidship thwart.</p>
<p>So, on that November morning Gershom's heart sank at the
thought of his coming imprisonment through winter's ice and snow.
Casper, backed by Uriah, might, in his absence, wear Mary down by
persistent entreaty. He must ask her and get her promise that
very day. Hatred for Casper burned in his heart. Casper was a
cunning craven who liked tilling the soil or shooting nets close
inshore, who in bad weather had to be driven by his father's
jibes to fish on the outer banks. Still, Casper had a fine white
house and twelve thousand dollars, cash money, in the Liscomb
bank. That would mean a lot to a woman or a man like old Jean
Dauphiny. He had naught but the light house as a dwelling, and
his salary as keeper, and would a woman like Mary Dauphiny choose
to live on Barren Island? He would give up the light if Mary
wished it, and build her a house on the main. Curse Casper Jung!
He was a better man than Casper; he could catch more fish, pull
harder on a halliard, and drive a boat through seas that Casper
dare not venture out in. He could sing, make ballads against his
enemies, and knock the hat off any man in the islands. He had
crowds of friends in Liscomb, Dover, and Polly's Point, whereas
Casper, with all his money, had none. All these angry thoughts
rushed through his head that November morning as he rounded the
eastern end, passed inside the sulking Bull, and made the Jungs'
landing.</p>
<p>The Jungs were packing herrings in the fish house, but David
stood at the head of the launch to welcome his friend. He was
discouraged, for his arm had swollen again and was paining him
more than formerly. They greeted each other in fisherman fashion,
and David did what he could to help Gershom drag out his boat.
Partner though he was in the Jung firm, he dared not hook the
landing cable into Gershom's stem ring without Uriah's order.</p>
<p>The old king, in yellow oil skins, came waddling to the
fish-house door. "Air a halibut on yur trawl lately?" he
queried.</p>
<p>"Ay, plenty. I got a whole school buoyed off de natural pier,"
replied Gershom scornfully.</p>
<p>"What's de matter, is ye short-handed dis-mornin'?"</p>
<p>"De boys is busy a packin' herrin' fur de Liscomb market
to-morrow. Herrin' is riz."</p>
<p>"Too busy fur to give a man a hand wid his boat, hey?"</p>
<p>The old king kept silent. He wanted Gershom to know that he
was an unwelcome visitor. Of all his numerous reasons for
disliking Gershom, none was greater than that Gershom had seen
his retreat before Anapest's shameful attack.</p>
<p>"P'r'aps de price o' gasoline is ris wid de herrin's, an' ye
poor fellers can't afford fur to start yur engine. Well, maybe
ye'll be wantin' a drag out on Barren Island some day. T'ank God,
I kin still haul a boat good as any two Jungs' David excepted,"
and with that bitter retort Gershom went whistling up the lane to
the school house.</p>
<p>David's ear caught some sneer about loafers from the fish
house as his eyes followed Gershom up the lane. The children were
just flocking out of school, and Gershom met them.</p>
<p>"Hello, Gershom!" they cried merrily; the cunning rogues knew
that Gershom bought hard candies by the bucketful and that his
pockets were always stuffed with them.</p>
<p>"Want some net rocks picked up?" they shrilled.</p>
<p>Now, while Barren Island is nothing but a projecting cliff
over which a mat of turf is laid, the rock formation there does
not split into long narrow slivers that fishermen can tie with a
double hitch as sinkers to the foot of their nets. So when
Gershom wanted net rocks he used to hire the urchins of Rockbound
to gather him a bushel and pay them in candies.</p>
<p>"Git along wid ye," said Gershom, giving each child a hard and
highly coloured candy. "I don't want no net rocks to-day."</p>
<p>"He wants naught but teacher," cried Nathan Kraus, a
bandy-legged brat, who from the age of two had walked swaying
like a fisherman balancing in a wave-tossed boat.</p>
<p>The children sent up a shout of laughter at this retort.
Gershom, in pretended anger, made a dive to catch the offender,
but little Nathan slid under the fence pole and danced away
through the pasture with cries of derision.</p>
<p>"You're naught but a passel o' young rogues," David heard
Gershom cry with his great voice. Then he hurried up the ledgy
lane from which all turf and soil had been worn by a century of
grinding cart wheels.</p>
<p>Mary, her red cap drawn over her ears against the nip in the
air, was waiting for him at the door of the schoolhouse. As he
approached with long rolling strides, his giant strength seemed
to overwhelm her. A woman could face life with such a man and
bear children to him gladly. She felt a pang of regret as she saw
far off the sea-mauled David standing in the attitude of
dejection at the launch's head, but that was forgotten when she
caught a glimpse of Casper peeping from the back door of the fish
house.</p>
<p>"Hurry up wid yur lunch, Mary," Gershom called gaily.</p>
<p>"I'll be with you in fifteen minutes," she replied, setting
off in the direction of Christian's house.</p>
<p>Gershom kept on up the lane and halted near the fixed light
that Uriah had tended for forty years. He lighted his pipe,
smoked furiously, hummed a tune, and stamped his feet in
impatience, till he saw Mary's red cap twinkle through the trees.
Then his heart rose in his throat; he broke out in a
perspiration; he would decide his fate that day. Mary joined him,
and they walked through the wood to their favourite place on the
cliff's edge.</p>
<p>"I seen Casper peekin' as ye come up de lane."</p>
<p>"He watches me wherever I go."</p>
<p>"Are ye wid him much, Mary?"</p>
<p>"He walks home with me after school. He won't enter Christian
Kraus's house, but when I call round to see the folks of an
evening he comes along."</p>
<p>"Do ye like him, Mary?"</p>
<p>"My father thinks he's a grand man, but I like David better;
he's had to endure so much from everyone. Uriah nags him now that
he's sick, and he's eating his heart out."</p>
<p>"But ye likes me best, Mary."</p>
<p>"I don't know, Gershom, I don't know."</p>
<p>"You got to marry me, Mary darlin'," Gershom blurted out.
"I'se wild about ye. You're goin' to marry me, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"My father says I've got to marry Casper Jung."</p>
<p>"Dat stingy coward! Don't take him."</p>
<p>"You're too wild and desperate, Gershom. People think you'll
come to ill."</p>
<p>"I'm none so bad, Mary."</p>
<p>"Yes, you know you're reckless in boats, and you've lots of
fights."</p>
<p>"I'se 'll change all dat an' be as quiet as a woolly lamb, if
ye'll have me."</p>
<p>"And you drink rum, Gershom, something awful."</p>
<p>"I'se 'll stop dat too when we's married."</p>
<p>"Why not stop now?"</p>
<p>"Dat I'se 'll do if ye says de word, lass. I had nair a drop
o' liquor this day. I plumb furgot to have my draught, I was dat
wild fur to see ye."</p>
<p>"Then there's Nettie Langille on Big Outpost, and folks say
you're often seen in Jennie Run-over's place."</p>
<p>"It's true, it's true, but I'se 'll go dere no more; I'se 'll
be true to you, lass, an' drink no more rum neider, an ye'll have
me. Dough mind, Mary, what I tell's ye; it's awful lonesome on
dat light wid nair a drink, an' strange yellin' goin' on t'rough
de night."</p>
<p>"The Jungs say you've got no religion, Gershom."</p>
<p>"Dat I can't change nur help, Mary. Would ye want fur to make
a long-faced hypocrite out o' me? Dat's de way a man's born, an'
I'se like my fader. Religion's well an' good fur dem as kin
believe. You don't want me to purtend, does ye, Mary?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't want you to pretend, but people tell such awful
tales about you, Gershom. Johnny Souter says you talk with the
devil."</p>
<p>"I talks wid myself, any man alone learns to do dat, and when
Johnny Souter comes out to mend my boots he hears me at it. He's
full o' ghosts and devils. Half my time, when he's dere peggin'
away, I pull down dish pans wid strings to fright him, an' he
goes back to de Outposts wid a mess o' ghost stories. He's naught
but a wisp of a man wid no guts in him. He won't eben leave de
light buildin' after sundown, and when he goes out in broad
daylight he's forever peerin' about an' lookin' ober his
shoulder. Why listen to his chatter? Don't believe what Uriah and
Casper says, eider; dey's got an ax fur to grind: Uriah wants you
fur Casper. Ask David about me, he'll speak me fair. I loves ye,
Mary, dat I does."</p>
<p>"I know you do, Gershom."</p>
<p>"Look here, snow and mist and mountainous seas come soon, an'
maybe drift ice. I don't fear no seas nor ice, I'd drive a boat
t'rough hell fur ye, Mary, but, try as I kin, dere'll be days an'
weeks, maybe, when I can't git off, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"That's true, Gershom. I'll be sorry when the winter and the
strong cold set in."</p>
<p>"But will ye have me, Mary?"</p>
<p>"I can't say yet, Gershom. I'll wait and see how you keep your
promises. I like you, but maybe I'd be safer with Casper. That's
what my dad says, anyway. If you only weren't so wild and would
save your money!"</p>
<p>"Mary, I'll change an' take a bearin' on de opposite point o'
de compass. I gits eighty dollars a mont' fur keepin' de
light--dat's a fortune on Barren Island--an' nex' summer come
I'll set t'ree halibut trawls and mackerel and herrin' nets. I
kin easy make five hundred dollars in a summer's fishin'. I'll
work dese hands off fur you, Mary, an' I'm de strongest man in
all dese islands."</p>
<p>"That you are, Gershom."</p>
<p>"Look here, Mary, you wait fur me dis winter, an' see if I
don't keep off rum an' women. I won't drink no rum, nur I won't
go nigh de Outposts or de main."</p>
<p>"How will I know that?"</p>
<p>"I'll give you my word, lass, and, look here, every day I'm
storm- or ice-stayed, I'se 'll fly ye a signal flag, an' you,
Mary, fly a signal back to let me know you've seed mine. Here on
dis stargon or 'gainst de spruce or agin de granite boulder. Will
ye do it fur me, Mary, if I'se icebound?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I will."</p>
<p>"And look, lass, fly a different colour ebery day so I'se 'll
know you've changed dem an' dat you're t'inkin' o' me. I kin see
dem right well wid my glasses. Fly a white or green 'gainst the
granite boulder, de red 'gainst de scrub spruce. When ye sees my
flag it means I'se keepin' off rum an' t'inkin' o' you, an' when
I sees yur signal I'se 'll know ye understands."</p>
<p>"I'll put up a signal every day, Gershom, I've got to go now,
it's time for school."</p>
<p>"An' ye'll have me in de spring if I sticks it out?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but keep it a secret."</p>
<p>"I kin tell David, maybe."</p>
<p>"Yes, tell David."</p>
<p>"Come close till I kiss ye den, Mary."</p>
<p>They walked back arm in arm through the spruces, to the door
of the schoolhouse, where Gershom said good-bye and strode
joyfully down the ledgy road. He said not a word to the Jungs in
the fish house as he passed, but held straight on to Anapest's
house to tell David the good news.</p>
<p>"Mary's agoin' to marry me in de spring if I keeps off liquor
t'rough de winter."</p>
<p>"You'se a lucky man, Gershom," said the generous David,
holding out his sound hand to be gripped by Gershom's paw. "I'se
right glad dat Casper's not agoin' fur to git her."</p>
<p>"An' it's a secret, man. Mary said to tell you and jus'
you."</p>
<p>David turned pale as Gershom spoke these words, and cast his
eyes upon the ground. Gershom noted his friend's pallor and
distress, but mistook the cause.</p>
<p>"You'se lookin' awful, Dave. Is it yur arm a-hurtin' or is de
old man worryin' ye?"</p>
<p>"He nags away an' says dere's no place fur a sick man on
Rockbound."</p>
<p>"De ole hound! Say, boy, why not git away from here? Come out
an' stay wid me on de light till ye gits yur stren'th an' yur arm
heals."</p>
<p>David was indeed ready for a new venture; any place would be
better than Rockbound with the nagging of Uriah and his heartache
for Mary.</p>
<p>"I'se 'll go wid, Gershom," he said. "Dat's a good idea. I kin
do a little cookin' an' sechlike wid my left hand, but furst
we'll have to see what Anapest an' de ole man says."</p>
<p>Gershom snorted his great laugh.</p>
<p>"Dat ole woman tries fur to run eberyt'ing, but she's a good
soul. I spose you'se under petticoat government now. I'se 'll
soon conwert de ole woman. As fur Uriah, to hell wid his
opinion."</p>
<p>Anapest at first protested violently against David's
departure, but in the end she yielded to Gershom's blandishments
and David's desires.</p>
<p>"See dat de hand is dressed ebery day an' dat David don't
ketch no cold. He's wort' two o' you, Gershom Born."</p>
<p>Uriah gave a grudging consent, and for a second time David set
out with Gershom for Barren Island.</p>
<p>One morning of the week before Christmas, when Gershom climbed
to the tower to put out the light, he gave a start of surprise on
looking down upon the sea; the whole surface was a rough jumble
of dull grays and glistening whites; the drift ice had come in
the night. Southward as far toward the open sea as the eye could
reach there was no patch of blue; northward, the drift was jammed
between Barren Island, Rockbound, the Outposts, and the Sanford
main. Spruce-clad Rockbound, in its new setting of drift, looked
like an emerald laid on a white cloth. He and David were
prisoners. His heart sank as he realized that he could not see
Mary for many a day, and he longed for a glass of rum. He
descended to the downstairs bedroom, where David slept because of
its warmth, and gave him the melancholy news. David, who knew the
secret of the signals, said: "Well, you kin try yur signallin'
now, Gershom."</p>
<p>"Yes," thought Gershom, as he stirred up the porridge in his
untidy kitchen. "Mary'll see de ice too, an' set her flag at
noon, an' I'se 'll fly my signal back. Dat's somet'in'."</p>
<p>Breakfast finished, David stretched out on the kitchen couch.
His arm was worse rather than better, he felt weak and tired, and
as he spoke but seldom he was poor company for the sanguine
Gershom. Gershom sat down to mend a torn net, a three-weeks-old
newspaper propped up before him. Old Gershom had solaced his
loneliness with books, and his son had inherited a love for
reading. He wove a few meshes and then glanced up to read an item
of news which he retailed to David. Presently a passage on
temperance set him off on a line of thought.</p>
<p>"Shakespeare's fellers was always fornicatin' and drinkin' and
carousin'. Dey seemed to git on all right. I wonders why women's
so set agin it now."</p>
<p>"I don't know," said David feebly. "I can't make dem out. No
man kin faddom de mind o' a woman. Dat's what I t'inks."</p>
<p>"De ole man used to say dat Byron an' his gang an' lots o'
great mens was hellians fur women."</p>
<p>David closed his eyes and offered no comment.</p>
<p>Then Gershom became impatient, the morning seemed interminably
long, the newspaper bored him, he could get no conversation out
of David, he was sick of mending nets. At ten he went
out-of-doors and hoisted his red ensign, although he knew that
Mary could not see his flag nor set hers in position before the
noon hour. He dawdled about and attended to various odd jobs to
pass the time. Presently he started up from his tinkering and ran
at top speed the quarter mile from light to boathouse, scattering
the frosty snow in glittering clouds as he ran. There he watched
for a little the drift-ice churn and grind against the logs of
his launch; as yet the ice had done no damage to his landing
place. He prized up the loose plank of his boathouse floor,
lifted out and with moist lips looked longingly at a hidden rum
keg. Reluctantly he replaced it on its rock cradle and, running
back to the light, went up into the tower to peer and peer for
Mary's signal. In vain he swept tree and cliff wall with his
glasses.</p>
<p>Then at half-past twelve, as he was beginning to despair, he
caught a flicker of green against the gray stargon. He even
imagined he could make out the red speck that was her stocking
cap, and he shouted till the whole light tower rang. He rushed
down the two flights of stairs to tell David.</p>
<p>"She's signalled, she's signalled. I seed her green flag."</p>
<p>"Ay," sighed David. "Now ye'se happy. Ye need have no fear
she'll break her word."</p>
<p>For a week, in response to his wind-tossed pennant, Gershom
saw Mary's signal daily. For the change of her flag at the noon
hour he spent the rest of the day in expectation. The imprisoning
ice made both Gershom and David restless and unhappy. When they
made the round of the cliff, they spoke less and less; the sight
of that endless ice field was depressing. North, east, south,
west, there was no flash of blue, nothing but vast stretches of
white, yellow, and dull gray. The field was formed of old ice
from the Far North broken into spheres, cubes, cylinders, and
pyramids, and eroded by the wash of a thousand tides.</p>
<p>Gershom talked of nothing but the signals, and was often
irritable and ill-tempered without a draught of rum that he
craved hourly. His energy was boundless, he was as restless as a
caged tiger. While David lay on the couch trying to get back his
strength Gershom paced to and fro, read furtively at his father's
books, which he already knew well-nigh by heart, mended his nets,
overhauled and rehooked his tubs of trawl, painted his boat, laid
a new plank floor in his boathouse, and on cold afternoons shot
brant and sea duck from the north ledge till his shoulder ached
from the kick of his heavy duck gun.</p>
<p>If his days were bad, his nights were twice as dreary. David,
the invalid, went to bed early in the warm bedroom off the
kitchen, while Gershom sat alone in the light tower, listening to
the wind cries, thinking of Mary and wondering if Casper were
with her. Often in these dark lonely hours he climbed to the
glass dome and sat by the light for company. As it revolved
quietly, telling off the minutes, it seemed a living and friendly
thing. Outside the winter wind shrieked, floes bumped and snarled
against the natural pier, sea birds came blundering against the
glass, but the light flashed out with calm and quiet dignity.</p>
<p>It was comforting to think that far out at sea some captain on
a dark sharply tilted deck was saying to his mate:</p>
<p>"There's a flashing light, watch it and count," and the mate,
stooping to get the binnacle light on his watch face, would call
out: "Five seconds flash, five seconds occult, five seconds
flash, five seconds occult, twenty-one seconds flash, nineteen
seconds occult." And the captain would back down the
companionway, look at his lights almanac, pop his head up again,
and say to the mate: "Yes, I thought so, that's Barren Island.
We're about ten miles off. That twinkle inside is fixed, isn't
it? That's Minden Rockbound. We ought to see Lubeck Island Light
soon, and in an hour Little Hope."</p>
<p>Yes, it was a great comfort for the lonely giant to sit by the
light that blinked faithfully, and to imagine these conversations
far out at sea, and to know that captain and mate were glad to
pick up his light and read his light's language. Perhaps it was a
liner with row upon row of flashing portholes the light spoke to,
perhaps a lumber-laden Norwegian barque, or perhaps one of the
Liscomb fleet, his own friends aboard, homing from Turk's Island
with a load of salt.</p>
<p>Some nights, when he left the light and went into the room
below, where he slept and kept his records, the shrieks and howls
of the wind about the light were awful. He longed for a drink,
but he had promised Mary that he would keep off rum, and he drank
none. His pipe was his great solace; he smoked continually
throughout the day and in the intervals of the night, when he
woke and ran aloft to see that the light was flashing clear. He
wrote pages upon pages of ballads and love verses to Mary, though
he could never get any rhyme for "Mary" but "fairy," and that was
silly. None of his verses seemed right to him, and not at all
like those of the great poets.</p>
<p>Of course, his chief occupation was watching daily for Mary's
signal. For the first week of their imprisonment all went well,
and he saw her flag every day, either white, green, or red. In
the second week came sea mists and driving snowstorms, and it was
only by watching through every rift in mist banks and every lull
of the snow squalls, that he caught short glimpses of his
sweetheart's flag. But in the third week, when the weather was
comparatively clear, Mary's signal was missing. Sometimes he
fancied he saw it for a moment at about twelve-thirty, but when
he looked again it was gone; it was neither against gray boulder
nor dark spruce. On the clearest days he could make out the gray
stargon, at the foot of which Mary and he had sat on the
crowberry vines, and where she had given her promise, but
certainly Mary's flag was not flying.</p>
<p>In his despair Gershom flung a thousand questions at David,
variations of a single theme. Was she sick? Was she false? Had
she so soon forgotten him? Had she taken up with Casper Jung? By
God, if she had, they would both pay dear for it. David, himself
sick in heart and body, did his best to comfort his half-crazed
friend. Sometimes Gershom in a maudlin mood would stand in
mid-floor with tears streaming down his face.</p>
<p>"Yes, she must be sick," he would shout at David. "She's sick
in bed, she's dyin' an' I can't git to her. Mary wouldn't break
her word to a man imprisoned in the ice."</p>
<p>One day, in the depth of despair, he pulled on his sea boots
and ventured out upon the ice, intent on making a passage to
Rockbound by leaping from floe to floe. Before he had gone fifty
yards a loose rounded block turned and threw him into the sea,
and it was only by his greatest effort that he made the safety of
his launch.</p>
<p>Still he flew his pennant and kept off rum. By turns anger,
hope, and despair possessed him. In his angry moods he raged at
David, forgetting his weakness. Uriah, the old fox, had been too
cunning for her, she had gone to Casper, the doxy, she had lied
to him, women had no bowels of compassion, they cared for nothing
but money. He stormed about the light tower, struck his fists
against the boarding till knuckles were skinned and bleeding, and
cursed the ice prison, mankind, God, and the devil. In this mood
of anger he hauled down his pennant at the end of the third week
of imprisonment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the ice closed in, Mary's heart was full of pity for the
imprisoned Gershom. She knew how restraint irked a man of
Gershom's sanguine disposition, and had imagination enough to
picture the awfulness of being hemmed in through winter storms on
a lonely island. She was glad David was with him. Daily she
watched for a rift in the sea ice through which he might drive a
boat, but no rift showed its streak of blue; instead, the intense
cold cemented the inner ice, and for the first time in the memory
of men living, people walked over the ice between Rockbound and
the Sanford main. This gave both Mary and Uriah a sense of
uneasiness, but for different reasons. Mary knew that it meant a
long imprisonment for her lover; it irked the old king to have
his island kingdom so closely knit to the main. Faithfully at
noon hour of each day, she trudged through the snowy wood to
place her flag in position against green spruce or gray stargon,
and saw Gershom's answering pennant raised and lowered on his
staff. In performing this simple act of faithfulness, she was
very happy.</p>
<p>Now, Uriah, crafty king of Rockbound, who saw and pried into
all that happened on his island, observed that Mary daily hurried
through the crusted snow to the eastern end of the island. His
curiosity was piqued; something was happening that he did not
fully understand. One day he stealthily followed her, at a
distance, and from the shelter of a thick spruce watched her
place her flag in position and look intently toward Barren
Island. His sharp old eyes, which had stared through many a fog
for his island's shape, followed hers to Barren Island, and he
saw Gershom's pennant dipped and raised.</p>
<p>"Signalling is it! Dat's dere game!" thought Uriah. "I'se 'll
stop dat quick, ain't it?"</p>
<p>He had no pity in his heart for the lonely men imprisoned by
the ice.</p>
<p>"I got him and David in de place where I wants dem now!"</p>
<p>While the thought of the inner solid ice disquieted him, the
sight of the outer loose-floating ice that imprisoned David and
Gershom filled him with joy. He waited patiently till Mary
started back through the wood, then advanced cautiously in the
shadow of the bushes, took down her flag, wrapped it up, and
stuck it in a cleft of the rock. Next day he was near the signal
rock well before Mary, and when he heard her far off brushing
through the trees, he replaced her flag, so that she might think
it had been in position during her absence. On the instant of her
departure--it was too cold to linger long--he removed the flag
and hid it as before. Day after day the patient old fox repeated
this man&oelig;uvre, until at the end of three weeks he saw that
Gershom no longer flew his pennant. The old man was delighted
with the success of his stratagem; without him his son Casper
would be a sorry wooer.</p>
<p>When Mary observed that Gershom's pennant was missing she was
bewildered and sick at heart. Was he sick, or had he broken his
promise and gone back to rum? He could not be sick, for on every
clear night she could see his light flashing, and even if he were
bedridden he could get David to fly the pennant. One of them
would make a smoke if either were in dire peril, though naught
but a government ice breaker could reach them. She racked her
brain for an answer; there was but one: Gershom had broken his
promise, gone back to rum, and forgotten her. He and David were
carousing together and making women a matter of jest. For a week
after the disappearance of Gershom's signal she faithfully set
her flag in position, and just as faithfully the cunning Uriah
removed and hid it. Then, in despair, convinced that Gershom had
broken faith, she gave up and visited the eastern end no
more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Casper was eagerly pressing his suit. Every
afternoon he was waiting to walk home with her from school. In
the evenings he followed her as she called from house to house.
To his credit he knew nothing of his father's stratagem; that
secret the old man kept locked in his breast. Nor did Casper
speak unkindly of Gershom and David; he was cunning enough to
know that slander and gossip displeased Mary. Once she asked
timidly: "How do you suppose Gershom and David are getting on all
this time?" His reply, "Oh dey're all right. Dey got plenty o'
coal an' meat an' drink. Dey's a great pair when togedder fur
laughin' an' drinkin'," confirmed her worst fears. Piqued and
hurt in pride, she tried to see desirable qualities in Casper.
Though he was not quite the man to be the father of children she
would bear, he was at any rate strong, sober, and patient. After
all, would life on Barren Island be endurable? What if she were
imprisoned by the ice--could she endure for weeks, alone,
Gershom's boisterous strength? Her hurt mind turned more and more
toward Casper, though to his frequent solicitations she refused a
promise of marriage. She would wait, she resolved, and see what
happened when the ice broke.</p>
<p>But Uriah was impatient. Was all his labour to be fruitless?
Daily he rated Casper in the fish house for his lack of
enterprise and he rarely passed Mary without calling after her:
"When is ye agoin' to tell us de good news, lass?" This was no
time for sluggard lovers, and the old king decided to play his
trump card. One bitter morning at break of day he set out,
crossed the ice to the main, crunched through the snows of a
wooded peninsula, and before nightfall was at Jean Dauphiny's
house on the Bay of God's Mercy. In the kitchen that night the
two old men sat long in muttering conference, and when Uriah came
back next day to Rockbound old Jean was with him.</p>
<p>Old Dauphiny greeted his daughter and without delay began to
urge her immediate marriage with Casper. He had been frightened
by the story Uriah had told him of his daughter's intrigue with
Gershom. A father's wish, he reminded her, is usually obeyed by
dutiful children, and scolded her severely for having taken up
with Gershom. Shame upon her, did she wish to spend her life on a
lonely island with a reckless drunkard? Upon Casper's virtues he
dwelt at great length: he was a good man and a safe one, a man
who could read and write, well versed in the Bible, a rich man
among fishermen, who would become richer when his father died.
Casper was his choice, and he made angry threats should she
disobey him.</p>
<p>In her distress she turned to old Anapest and to Fanny, the
potato girl, the only disinterested persons on the island.
Anapest's views, she felt, might be coloured by a desire to
oppose anything that Uriah promoted. To her astonishment, Anapest
said, after some thought: "Casper Jung's a poor fish, as is all
dose Jungs, an' o' course I favours Gershom; still, ye better
think a long while, lass, 'fore ye go agin yur fader's will."
Anapest gave this advice thinking of the necessity of retaining a
guiding hand in the affairs of her own empire. Like the absolute
monarch, she was fearful of the establishment of a republic on
the fringe of her kingdom.</p>
<p>Fanny, the potato girl, who had tasted bitterly of the
meanness of the Jungs during her years on Rockbound, ended her
advice by saying: "Gershom Born's a better man dan Casper Jung,
an' a more generous, but if I was you, Mary, I'd wait an' take
David. He likes ye, too, dough he says naught. He's de kindest o'
all an' would wear best."</p>
<p>But Mary had no desire to introduce a new element into her
troubles; she had put the thought of David as a husband out of
her mind. It seemed strange to her, however, that in this crisis
of her life she yearned for David's counsel and advice. He was
the only person in the world, she felt, who could tell her
rightly what to do. Nightly she knelt in her chilly bedroom and
prayed the good God to open a sea lane so that David might come
and counsel her. It seemed strange that she never prayed that
Gershom might come. Gershom's coming would mean fierce,
boisterous quarrels; it would be his way to fight them all and
carry her off by force. She prayed fervently for that sea lane,
but no sea lane opened. Instead, the devil jammed the ice tighter
in the bay, and the Lord God could not push it out. Intenser cold
came that cemented ice blocks outside of Rockbound, despite the
heave of the open sea.</p>
<p>Finally, Mary's resistance was broken, and under cumulative
pressure she consented to marry Casper. Uriah dispatched Joseph
across the ice to fetch the Reverend Green, minister on the
Outposts. The old king knew that the ice would not stay in the
bay forever, and that if his plans were to be crowned with
success the wedding must be held without delay.</p>
<p>The wedding, celebrated in the seventh week of David's and
Gershom's imprisonment, was a great social event on Rockbound. Of
course, no Kraus was asked, but old Jean Dauphiny was there, and
every soul of the Jungs and their dependent sharesmen was
invited. In Uriah's chilly parlour, from the walls of which a row
of ghastly carboned ancestors looked grimly down, the Reverend
Green mumbled through the ritual, and Mary, in low, soulless
tones, promised to love, honour, and obey the apple-faced Casper.
Her thoughts were on Barren Island: Gershom, though he had broken
troth, would be savage with rage, and what would David think? He
might think that she cared only for money and that Casper Jung
had bought her. He would never know how she had suffered or what
force had been put upon her. Uriah went about with a beaming
face, for he had arranged the destinies of his subjects and shown
himself a true king.</p>
<p>The long table was laid in the kitchen; Uriah and Jean
Dauphiny, patriarchs, sat side by side at the upper end; Fanny,
the potato girl, and Nat Levy, the lowest paid sharesman, at the
lower end; along the sides were ranged the Jungs in strict
accordance with their feudal ranks. On the table were platters of
roasted brant and sea duck, piles of kraut and potatoes, pumpkin
pies, pitchers of hot brown rum, red apples, candies, and at
Uriah's end a joint of roasted veal. The old man had intended to
rear his bull calf for an ox, but in his delight at Casper's
lucky marriage had sacrificed it to the occasion. In the brick
fireplace the spruce logs roared, cracked, and shot out glowing
sparks upon the floor. When Uriah, red-faced patriarch, stood up
to whet his long knife and carve the joint of fatted calf he
shouted to everyone: "Eat and drink hearty." He and old Jean
pledged each other in hot rum, and all drank the health of bride
and groom. Hot rum loosened their tongues; they began to talk
freely; rude jokes brought shouts of laughter; in the midst of
this babble Mary sat silent, pale but comely in the gray dress
Martin's widow had made for her. She alone thought of the men on
Barren Island: Gershom had forsaken her, but what would David
think? Casper did little but grin and fix his narrow eyes
greedily upon his bride.</p>
<p>Dinner over, Nat Levy was ordered to play jigs on the fiddle,
and dish pans on the walls and hams hung from the rafters danced
with the dancing feet. Uriah, who believed in the propriety of
drunkenness at a wedding, saw that the rum jugs were placed at
strategic points and refilled as soon as emptied. With the
dancing the Reverend Green withdrew; it was not seemly, he
thought, to be in a room where both drinking and dancing were
being carried on. He was glad, however, that Uriah's wife
followed him into his fireless bedroom with a warming pan and a
steaming glass of rum.</p>
<p>Joseph and Ned Slaughenwhite fell sound asleep in corners
before the evening was spent, and had to be carried home on
stretchers by sharesmen who lurched and swayed as they crunched
through the snow. As the party came to an end and these drunken
ones were carried off, Mary thought: "And I cut poor Gershom off
his glass of rum on that lonely island!" Then she walked with
Casper to his dark house, with as much dread in her heart as had
the Athenian girls handed over to the Minotaur. At that moment
David was turning restlessly upon his bed, and Gershom in the
light tower was adjusting the mantle and cursing the ice that
held him prisoner.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>One day in the eighth week of imprisonment a sea lane opened
between Rockbound and Barren Island, and the half-crazed Gershom
pushed off with fast-beating heart and drove his boat through the
ice to see what had happened to Mary. David stood by to tend the
light in case the ice closed and cut Gershom off. From safe
cover, Uriah and Joseph watched him as he zigzagged from floe to
floe. He was a desperate man, they knew; how would he take the
news? Fear was in Joseph's heart. Certainly he had better not
learn from them; he would go straight to Anapest's house, they
reckoned.</p>
<p>Gershom could pass round neither eastern nor western end to
reach a landing, but as the pack kept all surf down, he ran
straight into Sou'west Cove, beached his boat upon the frozen
sands, and hauled her out as best he could.</p>
<p>Just across the bar, from the point on the beach where he had
landed his boat, the rosy-cheeked Rockbound children were making
a skating place by clearing Nigger Pond of snow. They had not
seen Gershom's approach through the sea lane, for Nigger Pond is
set low, and the winter seas had piled the bar high with beach
rocks, but as his head and shoulders appeared over the barrier
they rushed toward him with shouts of joy.</p>
<p>"Hello, Gershom, hello, Gershom!" they called. "We'se right
glad ye got off Barren Island."</p>
<p>"What a pity ye couldn't git in fur de weddin'."</p>
<p>"Us had ducks, an' roast calf, an' heaps o' kraut."</p>
<p>"Whose weddin'?" he asked faintly.</p>
<p>"Teacher's an' Uncle Casper's, o' course. An' we was allowed
to stay up late, an' had cakes, an' candy, an' preserves."</p>
<p>"An' Nathan an' Caleb was sick."</p>
<p>"When was all dis?" he stammered.</p>
<p>"Oh, a long time ago. An' Uncle Joe an' Nat Levy was awful
drunk, an' Nat Levy played de fiddle, an' dey all danced in
Gran'pa's kitchen."</p>
<p>"An' we all danced, an' de minister, he said it were wicked,
an' we kep' on dancin' jus' de same."</p>
<p>"Where'd de minister come from?" asked Gershom, hoping to get
the truth by detail.</p>
<p>"Uncle Joe went ober de ice an' fotched Mr. Green from Big
Outpost, yes, he did."</p>
<p>Gershom was stunned and turned to stagger away. Yes, she had
been false to him and broken her promise to wait till spring.</p>
<p>"Ain't ye got no candy in yur pockets to-day?" the children
shrieked at him.</p>
<p>Gershom turned and fished out a candy for each of them from
his deep pockets, then staggered across the bar toward his boat.
His knees felt weak, his face was as white as a new sail, he
wrung his hands together in his agony. When he topped the bar he
met Christian Kraus face to face.</p>
<p>"Hello, Gershom."</p>
<p>"Hello, Christian."</p>
<p>"Glad ye got off de island. Eberyt'ing all right?"</p>
<p>"All right. De children tells me ye've had a weddin' on
Rockbound. Is dat true?"</p>
<p>"Dat's true, Gershom."</p>
<p>Then Gershom began to cry, half in rage, half in anguish. The
tears ran down his cheeks as he bellowed with anger and stamped
his feet upon the beach rocks.</p>
<p>"I'se agoin' fur to kill dat bugger Casper."</p>
<p>Christian kept silence; he was sorry for Gershom.</p>
<p>"Where is dey now?" asked Gershom, mopping his face.</p>
<p>"De inside ice holds, an' dey've went off to wisit her folks
in Bay of God's Mercy up to de west'ard."</p>
<p>"Dey was some dirty trick somewhere. Mary promised to wait
till spring. By God, I'll be revenged on de Jungs o' Rockbound.
By God, dey'll rue de day dey stole my woman from me an' me froze
in on de light."</p>
<p>Christian said nothing, there was nothing to say; he did not
know of Uriah's ruse, and even if he had known, he would hardly
have dared tell Gershom in such a rage. The man was half crazy
with grief and loneliness. Despite his hatred of the Jungs, he
did not wish to have murder on Rockbound.</p>
<p>"I got to be gettin' back to de light now, 'fore de lane
closes. You tell Uriah, damn him, he ain't t'rough wid me yet.
I'se'll be back to square accounts wid Mr. Casper."</p>
<p>"De ice shuts in quick on an ebb tide," said Christian,
anxious to speed Gershom's departure, "an' it's jus' de top o' de
flood now."</p>
<p>Christian helped Gershom off with his boat, and, flinging a
curse at Uriah and the Jungs of Rockbound, Gershom jumped aboard
and was off through the channel, already half full of bobbing ice
floes. He was numbed at what seemed Mary's treachery, but he had
little time to think about it on the outward voyage, for the blue
lane began to narrow with the first of the ebb. What if it closed
and he could not get back? David would light the lamp, but Uriah
would report his absence, for he had always coveted Barren Island
as a post for one of his retainers. Gershom's outward journey, in
fact, was a succession of swift advances and returns from stem to
stern. He set the tiller in a notch to keep the boat on a certain
course; then, oar in hand, darted to the bows to ward off a block
of ice, then swiftly back to the stern to set the tiller in
another notch. Between him and Rockbound the ice was closing
fast. He had no time to think of Mary, the whole of his mind was
concentrated on a struggle to make Barren Island. Sometimes he
had a choice of two or even three channels, and then he slowed
down his engine and, standing forward by the spar, surveyed the
route with a swift glance and selected that most free from big
cakes.</p>
<p>David, on the shore of Barren Island, stood for a long time
watching Gershom's slow progress through the floes. Would he make
the passage or have to return to Rockbound? He wished he had lit
the lamp at midday and gone with him in the boat. When he was
certain that Gershom would get through, he walked back to the
light, shivering with the cold that shot fierce twinges of pain
through his arm.</p>
<p>Gershom was not caught in the ice jam; in two hours he made
the passage, hooked on the cable to his boat's stem, and, with
the windlass, hauled her up well clear of the grinding ice. That
done, he prized up the loose planking of his boathouse and,
stooping, lifted out a five-gallon keg of rum. He broached it and
drank deeply of the raw liquor. Now he had time to think of the
injustice done him, and his anger began to grow. As he drank, he
cursed all men, and swore by all the gods he knew that he would
destroy the Jungs of Rockbound and the whole world, if it lay in
his power. He drank more rum, and then, swinging the keg on his
shoulder, staggered across the turfy path toward the
lighthouse.</p>
<p>Twilight was already coming; in another half hour it would be
time to light the lamp. To hell with the light! Let the ships run
on the rocks and men's bodies be bashed to pieces! What cared he
for men! Uriah and Casper and Mary had somehow cheated him of
life; he would cheat the world of life!</p>
<p>He burst into the lighthouse kitchen, his eyes bulging with
rage and drink.</p>
<p>"She's married!" he screamed at David.</p>
<p>"Married!" echoed David, his head drooping to his knees.</p>
<p>"Ay, married to that bloody Casper, damn him!"</p>
<p>David groaned deeply.</p>
<p>"How'd ye learn that?" he asked faintly.</p>
<p>"From de children on Nigger Pond and Christian what I met on
de bar. By God, she'll rue de day. Dey's gone to Dauphiny's now.
I'se'll twist de fat head off dat bloody Casper when I meets
him."</p>
<p>"Ye can't do dat, Gershom."</p>
<p>"Dat I kin and will."</p>
<p>"Den ye'll be hunged."</p>
<p>"Who de hell cares? I'se'll have my revenge, anyhow," shouted
Gershom, tossing off another glass of raw rum. "I'se'll beat hell
outer all Jungs, 'cept you, Dave, dat I will. I'se'll devote my
life to beatin' hell outer Jungs whenever an' wherever I finds
dem." Then, in an altered mood, he shouted: "Oh, Mary, how could
ye play me false?" with a bitterness that pierced David to the
heart and made him forget his own sorrow. Then Gershom began to
cry; without restraint he howled and blubbered like a great
schoolboy beaten by a teacher.</p>
<p>"De sun's low on de Ragged cliffs, Gershom," said David,
hoping to divert him from his wretchedness. "It's time fur to
light de lamp."</p>
<p>"I ain't agoin' to light de lamp no more, dis night nor no
oder night," shouted the tearful giant.</p>
<p>"What if a wessel goes ashore, wid no light burnin'?"</p>
<p>"Let de bloody wessels go ashore, an' de bloody mens in dem.
Dey's all rotten. All mens and womens, too, is rotten. Let dem
perish on de cliffs in de freezin' winter sea. Let de ice grind
de Jungs to bits, way it did the flittin' nigger! I lights dis
lamp no more."</p>
<p>"Den ye'll lose yur job as light keeper, and maybe Casper'll
git it. Uriah's tried fur years to git dis light."</p>
<p>That sobered Gershom and brought a cunning leer into his
drunken eye. "You'se right, Dave, by God, you'se right! Dey'd
steal my light from me if dey could"; and half crazed with drink
and anger he staggered up the tower stairway to light the mantle
and wind the revolving mechanism. The mantle flared up, and,
cursing and swearing, he applied the hand crank to the shaft that
wound the revolving apparatus, and gave a savage heave. There
came a tearing crack followed by a confused buzzing; he had
broken the mainspring.</p>
<p>That sobered him thoroughly; now the clockwork would not
revolve, and the light would appear as a fixed one! God, what if
some vessel making Duren Bay would mistake his light for
Rockbound and run hard on the northeast shoal! Then he would lose
the post, and Casper Jung would get it, and old Uriah would
chuckle. Neither they nor the devil should cheat him of his
light. They had stolen Mary, but they could not steal away his
friend to whom he talked on long winter nights. There was only
one thing to do: to turn the crank by hand through all that
night, and through every night, till the supply boat ploughed
through the ice and came to him in answer to his emergency
signal.</p>
<p>He ran downstairs to tell David of his predicament, and,
returning, began to grind, his watch before him, timing each
complete revolution of the occulting apparatus to sixty seconds.
It was wearisome work, but it helped him to forget his sorrow. He
had no time to think of women, as for two hours he ground,
cursing quietly. David climbed the stairs wearily to offer help,
but Gershom declined curtly; it was no job, he said, for a sick
man with one arm. David went back to his bed and Gershom
continued to grind alone.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, there flashed into his
mind a sharply outlined picture of his grandfather's clock in the
old house on Big Outpost. It was a tall clock, he remembered, and
when he had stood before it as a child it had seemed to tower up
into the darkness of the rafters. It had been brought with the
first shipload of immigrants, the old folks said, and had been
made by some cunning old clockmaker of Frankfurt am Main. It had
not been run by a spring, but by big weights hung on chains. Then
came his grand idea: why not run the light mechanism by a weight?
Fired by this idea, he stopped grinding: Barren Island must
appear as a fixed light for a while; after all, he thought, the
inside and outside ice is so heavy, no vessel can make the bay,
only vessels far out at sea might be misled.</p>
<p>He dashed downstairs and, without pausing to tell David where
he was going, ran out into the yard to get a small block of dried
maple he had left on the edge of the wood pile. As he stooped to
pick up the stick, the ghost yelled at him, "Ahoy, there, ahoy!"
in its unearthly voice. Gershom straightened up and shouted back:
"Go to hell, ghos'. I'se too busy to fool wid de likes o' you dis
night, an' I ain't skeered o' nuttin' dat walks de eart' or de
wind." Whereupon the ghost replied, "Ahoy, there, ahoy," and from
the cliff there came a noise like the crash of a broken boat and
the clatter of oars.</p>
<p>Gershom secured an auger and a couple of small chisels from
the oil house, and with these climbed back to the tower. There he
bored a hole in the end of his maple block, squared it with the
chisels, and fitted it tightly over the end of his crank shaft.
Down again he darted for a coil of half-inch rope and a single
block pulley. Lantern in hand, he ventured out on the sloping
face of the natural pier in search of a beach rock. It must be a
rock of peculiar size and shape, larger at each end than in the
middle, so that a rope made fast to it could not slip. By
daylight he could have found quickly a score of such rocks, but
it was no easy task in the darkness.</p>
<p>The ice ground and snarled against the cliff, and spray driven
by a rising southeast gale drenched him through and through; the
blown spume in the white ray from the light made unearthly
iridescent colours. The ledge was sloping and slippery; a single
misstep, and he would be in deep water among the ice floes. Over
his head squawked the careys by thousands, like minor demons,
glorying in such a night.</p>
<p>He peered about him in the small circle of light his lantern
shed, and at last espied the very rock he needed, a granite of
some twenty pounds, worn small in the middle by being trundled
about in the seas. He slid his feet cautiously along the sloping
surface, but, as he stooped to grasp his stone, a sly,
treacherous roller slipped in under the ice, broke on the pier,
and flushed the great shelf. Out went Gershom's lantern. He was
knee and elbow deep in icy water, but he held fast to his stone,
and when the wave receded worked his way up the shelf, the
lightless lantern hooked over his left arm and the rock between
his big hands.</p>
<p>Then he was back in the light tower, dripping but warm. He
made fast and wound the rope with many turns about the maple
block that was wedged fast to the crank shaft, attached the
pulley with a stout iron staple to the casing of the window, rove
the free end of the rope through the pulley, made fast the
granite rock with three good turns and two net hitches, and
lowered the rock gently from the window. As soon as the weight
came on the rope, the occulting apparatus began to revolve.
Gershom clapped his hands, bellowed like a bull let loose in a
spring pasture, and roared out his full-hearted laugh. In his
excitement over the mechanism he had forgotten the treachery of
Mary, Casper, and Uriah. But at what speed she ran! He pulled out
his watch. God, it was midnight! She was making a revolution in
thirty seconds--twice too fast. He must rig a brake. But he found
a brake unnecessary, for, by adjusting the timer, he could run
the occulting mechanism fast or slow. He turned the adjusting
screw till he got a revolution in exactly sixty seconds. By God,
it was perfect! Looking out the window, he saw that his granite
rock had not lowered perceptibly; there was a fifty-foot drop,
and she would run all night. "Nuttin' to do but h'ist up de rock
in de mornin' to run anoder night." He gazed in wonder and
admiration at the work of his hands. "Nair a one o' de Rockbound
Jungs could do dat."</p>
<p>He went below, pulled off his wet sea boots, and tried to
sleep, but it was no go: he was too excited and exultant. Then
came a relapse, as he began to think of Mary at that very moment
lying in Casper's arms. To whom could he now recite his epic
struggle with the light? Once Mary had listened with glowing eyes
to the story of his adventures. The glory of his achievement, now
that he could not tell it to Mary, turned to bitterness and
despair. He had almost forgotten the existence of David, who in
the room below heard his deep groans and mad trampling to and
fro.</p>
<p>There was but one cure for his sorrow, and he sprang up and
drank draught after draught of rum. His spirits rose again, and
he began to shout and sing. He picked up the Bible and began to
read from the Book of Job in a loud chanting voice: "Why is light
given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?"
That line, "Why is light given to a man whose way is hid," must
mean him. He drank more rum and became maudlin and sentimental.
God had allowed the devil to afflict Job with boils and the loss
of all his cattle and children that in the end he might bless him
with great possessions. Perhaps God meant something like that for
him; perhaps God had sent him that trouble with the light to save
him from madness. He fell on his knees, clasped his hands, and
cried aloud: "O God, t'ank ye fur breakin' dat spring."</p>
<p>"God didn't break that spring, I broke it," said a deep voice
behind him.</p>
<p>Gershom pivoted on his knees and saw an obscure burly form in
the dark corner by the desk. It looked like the figure of Uriah
Jung. Every hair of his flesh prickled.</p>
<p>"Who is ye?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know me?"</p>
<p>"Dat I don't."</p>
<p>"I'm the devil, and I broke that spring to keep you from
pressing the trigger of your duck gun with your toe, or drinking
yourself to death like your father."</p>
<p>"Is you de devil?"</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>Gershom plucked up courage.</p>
<p>"Come out where I kin see you."</p>
<p>Out in mid-floor stepped the devil, clad in sea boots, blue
dungaree pants and jacket, a sou'wester on his head, and no trace
of tail or cloven foot. He certainly looked like a Rockbounder,
for he had the big nose and jaw of the Jungs and the rounded
cut-up nostrils of the Levys.</p>
<p>"An' what might ye be wantin' wid me?"</p>
<p>"I've come to save you."</p>
<p>"Save me fur what, fur Christ's sake? I'm not wantin' to be
saved. Ye talks like a damn preacher."</p>
<p>"I'll save you to get revenge on the Jungs."</p>
<p>"Now you'se talkin', dat sounds good. How kin I git my revenge
on Uriah and de damn stinkin' Jungs? By Christ, I'll kill de lot
o' dem, David excepted."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you how to get a good revenge," and he crossed the
room, stooped, and whispered something in Gershom's ear. His eyes
bulged in terror and amazement. It is no light thing to have the
devil whisper in your ear.</p>
<p>"Are you game?" asked the devil.</p>
<p>"I is," replied Gershom, "but don't forgit yur part o' de
promise."</p>
<p>"The devil never forgets."</p>
<p>"Here, drink hearty to de bargain from dis island lovin' cup."
He raised the rum pitcher to take a hearty draught himself,
swilled mouthful after mouthful, but when he lowered the jug the
devil was gone. The jug dropped from his fingers and crashed to
the floor, he made three swaying lurches across the room and
sprawled upon his bed. The light burned next day till David
climbed the tower and extinguished it.</p>
<p>As long as the ice imprisoned him, Gershom went about with the
text of the devil's revenge humming through his brain. He was a
changed man; he seldom spoke to David, and, absorbed by his own
thoughts and plans, almost ignored his existence. By times he
cursed and swore, by times his lips curled in a cunning grin. To
keep himself from entire madness, he jacked up the west side of
the oil house and put a new sill under it; with every blow he
struck he knocked a Jung upon the head: "Dere's one fur Uriah,
dere's one fur Joe, dere's one fur Casper, and dere's a lot o'
little ones fur de scum dey've bred." Sometimes he stood up, put
his thumb to his nose, and twiddled his fingers at his enemy the
sea, and cried in derision, "Dere, I'll take yur picture, ragin'
winter sea."</p>
<p>Every night he drank heavily and invited the devil to visit
him, but the devil never returned. However, he had lots of
company; one night swarms of little gray men about four inches
high came from under the old walnut desk, where he, and his
father before him, had made up the meteorological reports for the
government. These little men had bulgy popping eyes, and wide
mouths like sculpins, their lower lips drooping on their chests.
They danced and bowed and twirled their legs; then, forming
platoons and companies, marched and countermarched, a little
captain in yellow at their head twirling a gold stick longer than
himself.</p>
<p>Another night came a flock of careys; in a second the room,
which stank with their nasty fetid odour of fish liver, was full
of them, fluttering and squawking. That was a hideous night.
Gershom, lashing at the obscene birds with a stick, broke a
Sanford-made chair and cracked the top of his walnut desk. He
knocked down scores of them, but as soon as they touched the
floor they sprang up fluttering. They tangled their claws in his
hair, perched on the rim of his rum glass, and smothered him with
their horrid stink. By a great effort he got across the room,
stumbled down two flights of stairs, and, leaving the careys in
possession of the light tower, rushed out into the open air.</p>
<p>At last the ice broke, and a succession of ebb tides carried
it out to sea. The supply boat, in answer to Gershom's distress
signal, came puffing up to the island. She launched her stout
jollyboat to land oil and supplies, and Gershom proudly led the
inspector to the tower, to show him the mechanism he had devised.
A new spring was fitted, and over a friendly glass of rum the
inspector said:</p>
<p>"Uriah Jung reported that one night your light did not flash
from eight to midnight and burned next day till midday."</p>
<p>"Dat was de night my spring bust an' I rigged my stone,"
explained Gershom. "How could she flash? I groun' her by hand fur
two hours. De damn Jungs, dey see ebert'ing. What de hell would
dey o' done if dey'd bruk a spring!"</p>
<p>The fact that Uriah had reported on him rankled in Gershom's
bosom and deepened a hate already deep as hell. Gershom gave the
inspector a quart of brandy got from a friendly rum runner, and
on his arrival in Liscomb he wrote a long report on the gallantry
and resourcefulness of the keeper of Barren Island Light, and
that report rests in some dusty pigeonhole to this day.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The breaking of the pack enabled David to escape Barren Island
and the hateful company of a man who was no longer Gershom. Grief
and anger over Mary's apparent treachery had completely changed
his nature. In his anxiety for Gershom, David had almost
forgotten his own troubles. His hand and arm were healed, at any
rate, and he felt ready to go about light work. It was a glad day
for David when he set out in Gershom's boat for Rockbound.</p>
<p>Uriah, fox with a lion's heart, was at the launch's head to
meet them. To David's astonishment, Gershom showed no sign of
rage or violence, but greeted the old man with an affability that
seemed sincere. He shook Uriah's hand, and when questioned gave
an entirely false account of their imprisonment. He had mended
all his nets, cleared up all his chores, and had a grand time to
read and loaf. He even went into the loft and passed the time of
day with Casper and Joseph, who were putting new twine into a
seine spiller. He smiled upon them with a strange glitter in his
eye that only David noted. There was no mention of the marriage,
of course, but much talk of the hard winter, the ice, and the
likelihood of big flocks of spring sea ducks bedding near the
rock. Gershom went no farther than the loft, and made no attempt
to see or speak to Mary.</p>
<p>"De cold's tamed him," said Casper to his father one day, on
Gershom's departure.</p>
<p>"Maybe, maybe," replied the old king, "but he'll bear watchin'
jus' de same."</p>
<p>As David went about light jobs in the fish house, he often
caught glimpses of Mary, as she hung out her washing in the yard
or fetched wood from the wood pile. He saw unhappiness in her
attitudes; there was no joy in her movements. Like Gershom, he
made no effort to speak with her and she now spent all her hours
in the school or Casper's house. Even if he had spoken with her,
he would have asked nothing, and he knew she was too proud to
volunteer information. Why had she married Casper? That problem
he continually revolved in his brain as he went about his work.
Of course, Anapest had told him all she knew; but Anapest only
knew in part. Her version was that old Jean Dauphiny had come and
forced his daughter into marriage. There must be something more
than that, but the mystery of her choice he could not fathom.</p>
<p>Now that he was strong, he could no longer live with Anapest,
but returned to his lonely house, though he often crossed the
fields to talk with the old woman and look at the boy. They were
his only friends; Gershom and Mary were lost to him. No sunshine
came with the spring weather; again he was seized with the
obsession to sell house and land and go far away, yet he could
not. In his boat at sea he had often sensed an impending tempest
by languid air and sullen lowering cloud, and it seemed to him
now that such a cloud hung over Rockbound, and that Gershom was
the cloud from which a storm might break.</p>
<p>On almost every day of fine weather Gershom came to Rockbound
to hang about the fish house. David he ignored, but he smiled and
smiled upon Casper, Joseph, and Uriah. The Jungs seemed
completely disarmed. Sometimes, toward noon, he would set off for
the Outposts, waving his hand to Uriah and calling as he slipped
his boat down the launch: "Dis is my day fur sinful
pleasure."</p>
<p>One day in mid-March, as he loitered thus in the Jung's fish
house, he heard what he wanted to hear. Uriah, the general, was
laying out the work for the boys and issuing his orders.</p>
<p>"To-morrow, Joe an' Dave, take de big boat wid herrin' to
Liscomb an' bring back salt an' barrels."</p>
<p>Into his eyes came a leer of triumph; at last Uriah and Casper
would be the only Jung men on Rockbound; the Krauses' and the
Jungs' sharesmen he need not worry about.</p>
<p>Next morning Gershom on Barren Island watched with his glasses
till he saw the big boat, abreast of Bib Duck, on its way to
Liscomb. Then, with a mad grin, he ran to his launch, long duck
gun in hand, and pushed his boat into the surf. He drove straight
in for Rockbound and ran his boat up on Uriah's launch.</p>
<p>"Git yur guns an' duck tub quick. Dere's t'ousands upon
t'ousands o' sea ducks bedded round de Rock," he cried from his
boat to Casper and Uriah, who were fitting some new logs to the
head of the launch. Gershom knew that he could appeal to Uriah's
greed, who could not resist getting a boatload of sea ducks.
Moreover, the old man, though no shot, liked to tend the tubs
with his dory and pick up cripples. Uriah and Casper straightened
up from their work. To go ducking with Gershom, next to David the
best shot on the islands, was too great a temptation to resist.
Still, the old man thought he must show proper reluctance.</p>
<p>"What's dat you say, Gershom--t'ousands o' sea ducks bedded on
de Rock?"</p>
<p>"T'ousands, more like millions. Come on quick."</p>
<p>"Casper an' me was figurin' on fixin' de launch to-day, where
de ice gnawed her."</p>
<p>"All right! It's a shame ye'll miss all dose ducks. I'll git
two o' de Krauses to go wid."</p>
<p>"Don't do dat. We'll go wid. Git de duck tub down, Casper. Ye
kin tow our dory, Gershom, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Dat I kin."</p>
<p>They were soon off, and passed the eastern end, the dory in
tow, the duck tub amidships, Gershom at the tiller and Uriah and
Casper together on the low bow thwart. Now that Gershom had them
in his power, he grinned at them with a sinister flash in his
staring blue eyes and hummed a ballad as he steered for the
Rock.</p>
<p>Now, Gershom had neither looked for sea ducks feeding in the
shoals around the Rock, nor did he care two straws if none were
there. This was their season of migration, and if they found no
birds he could say to Uriah that the great flock must have rested
and taken the next hitch on their northward flight.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, sea ducks were there in thousands. They
got over the duck tub weighed down with rocks, threw out the
strings of decoy tollers, and the old man and Casper took off the
boats to a safe distance to tend and pick up. How Gershom shot
that day! Bang went his long gun as the sea ducks planed and
fluttered to light among the decoys; bang again as they struggled
to rise to windward. When he signalled Casper to take his place
in the tub, he had dropped eighty-three dead ones on the water,
along with a number of cripples, which the old man had gaffed
with his sharp boat hook.</p>
<p>By the time Casper had shot twenty-three, the afternoon was
well advanced, a sea was beginning to get up, and a ragged scrap
of white showed on the top of rollers going over the Rock.</p>
<p>"Time to be gettin' in," called Uriah, "if yur goin' to make
de light by sundown. Dough it's a pity we can't take a few more."
The old king was never satisfied.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Gershom, "by de time I sets ye in, dere'll be
little daylight to spare. We'd best be startin'."</p>
<p>They set off homeward, dory a-tow with the duck tub aboard it
this time. Gershom was at the helm, Uriah and Casper in the
shelter of the bows, a tarpaulin about their shoulders, and
fluffy eiderdown ducks piled high about their legs and feet. A
wind had risen, blowing cold from the northwest, and a big sea
was rising. In the west over Sacrifice were heavy bars of black
cloud through which the red disk of the sun glimmered. The three
duck guns were piled aft by Gershom; he had seen to that.</p>
<p>Casper nodded off to sleep--Rockbounders who worked long hours
and took little rest in bed slept when they could; in a boat when
one was awake at the tiller the others drowsed with head against
thwart or fish pen--but Uriah had his eyes half-open, at least
one eye, for his left eye always drooped and squinted. He was
busy calculating how many sea ducks he and Casper could claim.
True, Gershom had shot nearly all, but he and Casper had picked
up the dead ones and gaffed the cripples; yes, there should be an
even division; that would give him and Casper eighty ducks
between them. He felt them over, picked out a dozen birds with
thick breasts, and worked them into the corner of the bow as part
of his own share. They could freeze them solid at night and hang
them in the big ice house to last through the spring and early
summer.</p>
<p>The sea was running big now with a long swell; aft, where the
streak of white water left the screw, the stern was almost flush
with the sea. Gershom turned for a moment as if to look at Barren
Island, drew a flash of straight rum from his inside pocket, and
emptied it in three gulps. Presently Uriah, still pondering on a
division of the ducks that would accrue to his advantage, felt
beneath his buttocks that short, dull, compressed heave,
betokening to any experienced sailor or fisherman that a boat has
passed from deep to shoal water. The old man threw the tarpaulin
from his shoulders, raised himself, and glanced around: they were
headed straight for the Bull and almost on it.</p>
<p>"Quick, Gershom, sheer off quick, you'se steerin' over de
Bull," yelled the old man. Casper started up shouting: "Look out,
man, look out, de Bull's breakin'!"</p>
<p>"Ay," said Gershom calmly, a triumphant grin of madness on his
face, "yes, de Bull's breakin', and we'se goin' ober it. Me and
you wid."</p>
<p>Uriah and Casper started toward him, terror in their eyes.</p>
<p>"Stay forrad," yelled Gershom, picking up his double-barrelled
gun, his grinning mask dropped off to reveal satanic rage. "I'se
got a charge here fur each o' you if ye comes a step nigher."</p>
<p>"De Bull's breakin', can't ye see? Ye'll swamp her," screamed
Uriah.</p>
<p>"I knows de Bull's breakin'. I bin a-watchin' him. Us is goin'
ober him, an' to hell togedder. Now pray--pray, ye damn bloody
Jungs. Ye stole my Mary from me by some trick. No Jung eber got
ahead of a Born wid a woman by fair means. Pray, Uriah, ye old
fox. See if yur lovin' God will come down an' save ye now."</p>
<p>Casper cowered in the eyes, but Uriah sprang toward the
steersman, a ballast rock clutched in his old hand. "Sheer off,
ye crazy loon," he yelled.</p>
<p>A mountainous roller carried them onto the Bull, which,
snorting savagely with both nostrils, shot two streams of spray
high into the air. Down came the crest of the wave, filling the
boat flush from gunwale to gunwale. Down she dived beneath the
seas, dory and duck tub dragged with her by the weight of ballast
and engine. None of the three could swim far in that chaos of
breaking sea; a few choking screams drowned in the Bull's roar, a
flash of yellow oilskinned arms, and they were gone, to be
trundled over jagged cliff bottom or tangled in long streamers of
kelp. Loose boards came to the surface, and sea ducks, floating
belly up, made a circle of white in the Bull's foam.</p>
<p>Gershom went down triumphant, the devil's promise in his mind.
"You will land on Rockbound when Uriah an' Casper are washed to
and fro on the sea floor." He clutched an oar for a moment, but
it slipped from his grasp. The dory's painter had tangled about
his feet and dragged him down. Nevertheless, the devil spoke
true, for, while Casper's and Uriah's bodies were never found,
David, searching along the shore with Mary, found poor Gershom's
great body, battered and torn, among the boulders of Southeast
Cove.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>When Joseph and David got back from Liscomb with their load of
salt and barrels on the day of the disaster, they were surprised
that Uriah was not at the launch to haul out their boat and help
them unload. In sixty-odd years he had never missed meeting a
homing Rockbound boat; in the old days he used to be at the
launch with his cattle, and when the cattle were superseded by
cable and stationary engine, he used to stand on the lower logs,
cable in hand and slip the hook into the stem ring so quickly
that the boat slid up the launch scarcely losing her seaway. From
the sharesmen they learned that Uriah and Casper had gone ducking
to the Rock with Gershom. No one felt anxiety about them, for it
was a day of moderate weather, and it was a matter of common
knowledge that sea ducks settled best among decoys when the
beginning twilight hid boats and duck tub.</p>
<p>No one on Rockbound had seen the disaster to Gershom's boat,
for the Bull is hidden from the dwellings and fish house by the
eastern wooded knoll, but one of the watching women had seen some
boat far to the eastward of Barren Island, making in from the
Rock. As twilight fell and deepened into dusk, the women stared
seaward and waited and waited for Casper and Uriah. They made all
kinds of conjectures, none of which were satisfactory. Perhaps
they had stood in for Minden or Sanford, to sell their ducks, but
against that it was highly improbable that any boat could cross
the wide stretch of water between Rockbound and Sanford without
being seen by some soul on their island. Perhaps they had landed
on Barren Island for shelter, for the sea was rising, but that
hope died when night settled down and no light twinkled from the
Barren Island light tower. Joseph lit the fixed light on
Rockbound, as he always did when the old man was away, and
although the sea was rough and a wind blowing up, David made
ready his boat to go out to Barren Island. With him it was a
principle of faith that the great lights, on whose guidance
rested the safety of the fishermen, must always be lit. Above
all, his friend's light must flash its ray out through the night.
Moreover, David hoped that on the island he might get some bit of
information that would explain the whereabouts of Gershom,
Casper, and the old man. Though it was always dangerous around
the Rock, there was no reason why a stout boat should be lost
there on such a day. It was just possible that the light in the
tower was broken beyond immediate repair, though that did not
explain the unlighted lamp, for David knew right well that
Gershom kept two or three emergency paraffin lamps.</p>
<p>Just as he laid his hand upon his boat's stem to push her into
the sea, Mary came suddenly out of the darkness and caught him by
the arm.</p>
<p>"Where are they, David?"</p>
<p>These were the first words she had spoken to him in
months.</p>
<p>"I don't know, Mary, p'r'aps in Sanford, p'r'aps on Barren
Island."</p>
<p>"They never crossed the bay to Sanford."</p>
<p>"Den dey's on de island."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't the light burn?"</p>
<p>"P'r'aps de light's busted."</p>
<p>"I know where they are," she said solemnly. "They're
lost."</p>
<p>"Don't say dat, Mary, don't say dat till we hunts. Dey was all
good mens in boats."</p>
<p>"They're lost, I'm sure, I feel it inside me; still, if you're
going to hunt, I'm going with you."</p>
<p>"Not dis night," said David gently. "Not dis night, Mary. De
sea's rough."</p>
<p>"I've been out in rougher seas; I've been with my father on
Matt's bank. I'm going with you to hunt," and with that she
climbed aboard and sat stolidly on the amidship thwart. David,
seeing that he could not dissuade her, ran up to the fish house
to fetch her an oil coat and to send word by one of the sharesmen
to Joseph and Martin's wife that Mary had gone with him to Barren
Island.</p>
<p>They pushed off in the rising sea and rounded the western end
guided by the white of the breakers. Then David had to steer a
course, for there was no flash of light to guide him. Mary gave
what aid she could by holding a hooded lantern over the compass
box. Thus they ploughed through the night-black sea on their
quest, spray flung from the bows, a streak of white water astern.
When David heard the roar of Barren Island surf, he slowed down
his engine and, giving the tiller to Mary, ran forward, hooked an
arm about the spar, and stared ahead into the ring of white. Then
shouting by turns "port" or "starboard" to Mary at the tiller,
they made the cleft in safety, and David sprang out upon the
logs, painter in hand. Even as he did so, a big sea swilled into
the cleft, at the moment of their greatest danger, and
half-filled the boat. Mary was drenched, but she ran forward,
scrambled over the bows, and with the windlass they hauled the
boat to safety.</p>
<p>No answer came to their shouts. Save for the careys squawking
overhead and the tireless rhythm of surf, Barren Island was
silent as death. As they approached the spectral form of the
lighthouse, looming sudden and gray through the night, David half
feared to find there some evidence of tragedy. He thought of the
night when he and Gershom had found old Gershom's body on the
kitchen floor. But the lighthouse was empty and returned naught
to their cries but mocking echoes.</p>
<p>David at once went aloft to the tower, adjusted and lit the
mantle, wound the mechanism, and the light began to talk to boats
and ships at sea. Then he hurried out into the yard to run up
emergency lantern and pennant: that should bring the cutter in
two days, at the latest. He made a complete round of the cliffs,
calling down into every cove and cleft in the rocks.</p>
<p>When David returned to the light after an hour's search, he
found that Mary had built up a fire in the kitchen stove, dried
her clothing, and boiled some coffee. He could search no more
that night, and he had eaten little since morning. They sat down
in silence to their meal of coffee, tinned beef, and thick round
biscuit from Gershom's cupboard.</p>
<p>Once David ventured, "Dey mus' be on de Sanford main, dere
warn't no sea to-day to lose a stout boat wid t'ree such mens."
But to this Mary made no answer.</p>
<p>After supper, Mary cleared up the dishes and lay down on the
kitchen sofa. David went aloft to see that the light was burning
fair, then sat by the kitchen fire and smoked Gershom's pipe. It
was a blowy night, but not a wild one.</p>
<p>Once, after midnight, he asked softly: "Are ye warm enough,
lass?" and Mary replied at once, "Warm enough, thanks." Except
for that they spoke no word throughout the night.</p>
<p>When gray dawn glimmered through the windows, David put a pot
of oatmeal upon the stove and went up to put out the light. They
breakfasted, tidied up Gershom's kitchen, and set out for
Rockbound.</p>
<p>On their arrival they found that no word of Casper, Uriah, or
Gershom had come from the Sanford main. In little groups the
islanders began a search of the Rockbound shore, peering into
every rock cleft and turning over piles of kelp and seaweed on
the sand bar. David and Mary, searching together, made the entire
round of the island. A little before noon of that day, as they
walked along the cliff's brink above the Whale Cove, David's
quick eye caught a glimpse of some boards nailed together in a
triangular shape that were banging against the rocks at the
cliff's base. He clambered down and looked at them closely. His
head swam, he was sick at heart as he drew the boards from the
water; they told him the story; now he knew.</p>
<p>"What is it?" called Mary from the cliff.</p>
<p>"Naught but some bits o' boards," called back David.</p>
<p>He put the wet boards upon his shoulder and climbed the face
of the cliff to reach her.</p>
<p>"Dey're lost, Mary," he said simply, laying the pieces at her
feet. "It's de bow floor boards from Gershom's boat. I knows dem
well. Yes, dey're lost, Mary. Dey must o' run ober de Bull."</p>
<p>Mary stood mute and tearless, staring at the wet boards. What
thoughts ran through her brain! A rejected, half-crazed lover,
marriage with a man she did not love, and death within a
six-month.</p>
<p>"Don't grieve, lass, don't grieve too much," said David
gently, putting his arm around her. "Dat's de way wid us
fishermen, as ye knows well: one day livin' an' well, de nex' day
de sea gits us."</p>
<p>David led her back through the woods toward the houses, but
before they emerged from the shadow of the trees, Mary clutched
his arm and said, "Come and talk to me often, David. You're kind,
you're the only one can give me comfort. And, say, for my sake,
take the <i>Mary</i> on the banks from this on. She's mine now.
You take her. She's not so fast as your <i>Ph&oelig;be,</i> but a
stauncher boat."</p>
<p>David spread the melancholy news among the Jungs and went to
Anapest's house to tell her what he'd found.</p>
<p>"We oughter give ober dis fightin' on Rockbound, Aunt Anapest,
what wid dese childer a-growin' up. Yes, we oughter quit fightin'
twix' de Krauses and de Jungs."</p>
<p>"I were ready to quit long since," said Anapest, "but de old
man, he were dat hard. He'd 'a' done me out o' my rights on dis
island if I hadn't 'a' fought him--dough I don't wish to speak
ill o' de dead."</p>
<p>"My rights, too," said David. "He were dat mean, it's true. He
learned dat meanness, I guess, from de hard times de old Jungs
had in de old days. Still, he were a hellian to git work done, ye
can't deny him dat, an' in a kind o' rough way he kep' his

<p>"Ay, if ye watched him close," said the old woman.</p>
<p>"An' who'll mend de nets an' seines fur de Jungs, nets what's
ripped and mangled wid albacore? De ol' man gloried in dat work,
an' he done it fine. De ol' feller had his good p'ints. Life's
short fur a fisherman. Yes, us oughter quit dis fightin' an'
discord on Rockbound."</p>
<p>"Won't dat Joseph keep on jus' like his fader? He's de spawn
o' de ol' man."</p>
<p>"I hopes not. I can't say what Joe'll do, but as fur me, I
lives in peace. I won't quarrel wid Kraus, Jung, nur
Outposter."</p>
<p>"Joseph's boss now, we'll see how he carries on wid my boys,"
was Anapest's last word as he departed.</p>
<p>Nat Levy, the sharesman, went out to light Barren Island that
night, and to stand by till the cutter came. Next morning, soon
after daybreak, when the ebb was at its lowest, David found
Gershom's body in the sou'west gutter, tangled in long streamers
of kelp. They carried the body from the shore and laid it in
state on the parlour table of David's house, where the women and
children came to stare at it mutely. David fashioned him a coffin
of white boards, carried him to Big Outpost in his boat, and
stood bareheaded beside his grave. Casper's and Uriah's bodies
never came ashore.</p>

<p>But the world moves, work goes on, children must be taught,
and hungry mouths fed; one cannot live upon regrets and sorrow.
Within a few weeks of the island tragedy Mary was back teaching
the children in the Rockbound school; David, in his new boat, the
<i>Mary,</i> was setting halibut trawls on the bank beyond the
Rock, and Joseph had brought green sharesmen from Sanford to
labour in place of Casper and Uriah. The old man's demise made a
sad gap in the island life. He had been a real king, who alone
and without counsel had shaped affairs of state. Joseph had as
much greed but less character and deep cunning.</p>
<p>One day, when David came in from fishing, he found that a
Sanford boat had brought him a letter in a long envelope franked
by the government. He had never received a letter before, and
surmising that this strange thing portended evil his hand shook a
little as he took it. He weighed the letter in his great hand and
stared at it blankly. There was his name and address right
enough, printed on the envelope: "David Jung, Rockbound, Sanford
Post Office."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't ye see what's in her--you'se a risin' scholard,
ain't it?" said Joseph in a ferment of envious curiosity.</p>
<p>David tore the letter open and made what he could of the
contents, but he was vague about the printed word when he got
outside the realm of dissyllables. He left the curious Joseph
unsatisfied and carried the letter to Mary, who read it to him.
Its purport was as follows:</p>
<p>The officials of the Department of Marine and Fisheries had
consulted with the people of the islands and neighbouring main,
and they had been unanimous in their opinion that David Jung of
Rockbound was the fittest man in all the bay to tend the Barren
Island Light, which meant so much to their safety. Acting on
their suggestion, the Department offered David the light. The
temporary keeper would stay for a month, and he would have that
time to think the matter over, and make his business
arrangements, if he accepted.</p>
<p>"What you t'ink o' dat, now, Mary?" he gasped in surprise. To
have her know that the islanders trusted him gave him a glow of
pleasure.</p>
<p>Mary did not hesitate in her decision. "Of course, you must
take it. It's the first light in the islands. And you're the
right kind of man to keep an important light."</p>
<p>"I couldn't make out nair a government report."</p>
<p>"Nonsense. I'll teach you. Call in at Barren Island some day
as you come in from the Rock and get some of the forms. They're
naught but reports on wind and weather, and who knows wind and
weather better than you? I'll teach you how to fill them in."</p>
<p>"An' me wid a handwritin' like a fly creepin' ober a
page."</p>
<p>"I'll start you at writing again, and you can go on yourself
with copybooks. You must take the light. You and Joseph will
never agree on Rockbound. Already I can see the old quarrels with
the Krauses flaring up."</p>
<p>"I'd be right lonesome dere. De place's full o' haunts an'
ghosts."</p>
<p>"Why does a strong man like you talk of ghosts? Ghosts are
stuff made of ignorance and fear."</p>
<p>"It's right lonesome dere, Mary, on a windy night."</p>
<p>"Then you must marry again some day and have a wife with
you."</p>
<p>"It's none so easy to get the kind o' woman ye wants to live
wid on a place like Barren Island," said David, wishing in his
heart he could say something quite different.</p>
<p>"Then change Barren Island. That's what I'd do if I were a
man. Barren Island soil is as deep as Rockbound's, and see what
the old Jungs made of this island."</p>
<p>"De sea spray blows on de land dere an' salts it."</p>
<p>"Trees would stop the sea spray," said Mary with her honest
brown eyes looking straight into David's. "I own land here now, a
house, and a fourth interest in the firm. I'm going to look after
my property, and Joseph will bear watching. Take the light,
David. It'll be good to have a friend near me. I'll never marry
again, but I may live here always. Yes, take the light, David,
and come and see me whenever the sea is smooth."</p>
<p>David went that night to his old place of meditation on the
cliffs above the dog holes, where he could watch the light blink,
and thought the whole matter over. Joseph and he could never
agree, he knew, for Joseph had all the concentrated greed of the
old Jungs and was already back to a round of baiting the
sharesmen, minor cheatings, and quarrels with the Kraus men, who
had tried to show some friendliness after the loss of Casper and
the old man. Martin's and Joseph's boys were growing up and in a
few years could fish off Rockbound. Barren Island would be his
own--he could be king there, though not such a king as Uriah--for
he had found by inquiry that, with the exception of the acre on
which the light stood, he could buy for a small sum the whole of
Barren Island from Gershom's estate. Here on Rockbound, with
Joseph, he felt cramped and confined. He hated to leave the old
place that had been his mother's, but he could retain the
ownership and rent it to some married sharesman; in turn, it
could go to Tamar's boy, little Ralph.</p>
<p>David decided then and there to take the light, and before the
allotted month was up he stood one day on the launch, his boat
piled high with household goods, ready to set off for his
kingdom. Mary, who was herself on the eve of departure to pay a
visit to her parents in Bay of God's Mercy, stood by him to say
good-bye. Anapest came swaying down the pathway, little Ralph in
her arms; the Kraus boys shook him by the hand, but Joseph was
too busy goading the sharesmen in the fish house to waste time in
farewells. He pushed off into a sea as smooth as that on which he
had floated from the Outposts on the day he had first dared to
face Uriah. Mary waved her hand to him till his boat rounded West
Head, and when he looked back to Rockbound from the open sea, he
found she had crossed the island to Southeast Cove and was still
waving to him.</p>
<p>Now David had great dreams about Barren Island, and he was no
idle dreamer. He dreamed of making his island a garden; perhaps
he had got the suggestion from Mary. For the first weeks after
his arrival he drove his boat every day to the Sanford main and
brought it back loaded with little spruces. The island must be
reforested, as the underwater stumps showed it had been in old
time, and spruces are quick growing and stand up best against
wind and weather. He planted his spruces in a double row all
about the cliff edge of Barren Island. This was his first
labour.</p>
<p>This accomplished, he began his second: war upon Gershom's
enemies, the careys. This involved a journey to Minden to
purchase a pair of oxen and a heavy breaking-up plough. He and
Nat Levy, who had gladly come to him as sharesman, hoisted the
cattle into his big boat and lashed them to poles, one on either
side of the centreboard. He had waited for a smooth day for this
enterprise. When they arrived back at Barren Island, a derrick
had to be rigged, and the frightened, bellowing oxen hoisted out
with broad slings of canvas beneath their bellies.</p>
<p>Next day they began to plough the turf, Nathan Levy driving
the oxen with great shoutings and twirling of whip, while David
gripped the helves. At his heels followed two big dogs of the
Rockbound breed, that pounced upon the careys as they fluttered
from the furrows, and destroyed them with one crunching bite. It
was necessary to plough deep, to plough and cross-plough, but in
a fortnight of steady labour it was done, and the loose stones
were gathered into heaps, hauled on the drag, and dumped over the
cliff. No more was Barren Island the home of the careys; those
that fluttered in the air and escaped the dogs sought other
islands, where no plough cut the turf.</p>
<p>After the conquest of the careys David and his sharesman set
about digging a well, blasting out fragments from the rock, for
the soil was soon sweet with the evil birds gone. He had always
dreaded that Gershom might be imprisoned on the island and the
cellar tank run dry.</p>
<p>Next he declared war upon the herring gulls that bred and
nested among the rocks on the western side. David hated this job,
for the herring gull, with its snowy body, gray wings, and
scarlet bill, is a beautiful bird. He liked birds, and in spite
of himself admired the daring of these small gulls. But they
drove off the island all other birds except swallows, and he
wanted birds to come to his island, each kind marking a season:
long-legged curlew, yellow-billed black robins, golden plover,
and swift-winged checkerbacks. Moreover, the herring gulls were a
continual source of annoyance: they swooped close to one's face
with ceaseless shriek and chatter, they protested forever the
ownership of the island, they might even, he feared, pick out the
eyes of children, and children he hoped some day to have on
Barren Island.</p>
<p>So he and Nat Levy set about the ugly job remorselessly,
smashing the nests, breaking the eggs, destroying the fledglings,
and knocking down with stick or gun the old birds that hovered
about their heads in hundreds. It took much to discourage the
tenacious herring gulls, which had doubtless laid their eggs and
reared their young on Barren Island for centuries, but at last
they gave up the struggle, and, migrating to Big Duck, took that
island for a breeding place. Then, to David's great joy other
birds began to come to his island; one morning he discovered that
a pair of robins had nested in his spruce hedge.</p>
<p>Next came the labour of enriching the soil with rotted sea
dung. David and his man gathered all kelp and seaweed that drove
upon the shore, piled it in heaps above the cliff, and covered it
with turf and manure. But Barren Island is a poor place to get
sea dung; there is no beach on which it is rolled in tangled
masses after a storm. So, when he had time, he took his big boat
to Sacrifice, where he and Nat cut rockweed and came home
gunwale-laden.</p>
<p>David's last great labour was a sentimental one. On the
sloping shelf above the natural pier David and Nat set up a
derrick of three logs, lashed together at their tops and firmly
guyed at their bottoms. On this derrick they rigged tackles, and,
with the oxen hitched to the fall, moved and cross-piled some of
Pharaoh's coffins into a rough pyramid. On the very top David set
a square stone upright, upon its end, and upon this rock, north,
east, south, and west, David and Nat rudely graved the name
"Gershom." It stands there to this day as a memorial to his
friend, and fishermen far up and down the coast know it as
Gershom's beacon.</p>
<p>For two years David and his sharesman laboured in the
intervals between fishing seasons to make Barren Island a garden.
The hedge of spruces grew thick, cowering close to the ground on
the southward and seaward side, but keeping off, nevertheless,
the salt-water spray that had theretofore stunted the
grasses.</p>
<p>David fetched fence poles from the main, and divided his
kingdom into hayfields, pasture lot, and kitchen garden. Soon he
could grow cabbages and potatoes as large and fine as those of
Rockbound. He even set out a tiny apple orchard. No longer the
ghost cried, "Ahoy, there, ahoy," as he stepped from the
lighthouse door on foggy nights, nor was there any sound of
broken boats and clattering oars from the cliff's edge. With the
careys and herring gulls, the ghosts sought other haunts.</p>
<p>In fact, it had become so fine an island that one day the
inspector of lights, on his round of visits, said to David:
"Barren Island's a fit name for this island no more. The
government's having a new chart of the bay made; what shall we
name this island on the new chart?"</p>
<p>And David, after a moment's reflection, replied: "Name it
Gershom's Island, arter de great mens dat once kep' dis
light."</p>
<p>"Why not Jung's Island?" asked the inspector. "You made it
what it is."</p>
<p>"No," said David, "dere's a Jung's Island inside a'ready. Name
it Gershom's Island after de two Gershoms." And thus the island
was named on the new chart.</p>
<p>One summer day in the third year of his occupancy of the
island he saw a boat heading in for his landing stage. He ran
across the island and waited at the head of the launch. The boat
drew nearer: Christian Kraus was at the tiller, and amidships
were Mary, old Anapest, and little Ralph.</p>
<p>"We come fur to visit ye an' hold a picnic," called Anapest as
the boat's prow took the logs. "Yure glad to see us, ain't
it?"</p>
<p>"Dat I is," said David. "You'se right welcome."</p>
<p>"An' she's cum fur to marry ye," said Anapest abruptly. "An'
here's a start fur a family," and she put the little boy's hand
into his father's great paw.</p>
<p>David was dumbfounded, but Mary smiled serenely.</p>
<p>"I talked her into it," went on Anapest. "Says I to her,
'Ain't it a shame fur to leave dat strong man alone on Barren
Island an' him a-lovin' ye to death, an' ye a stout lass wid no
man an' nair a kid? Ain't dat a pretty kettle o' fish?' says I to
her, an' in de end she sees de p'int. She wants ye, too, she's
been a-wantin' ye all along. Ain't dat de complete foolishness
now, to be young an' livin' alone an' missin' de good years,
'cause ye lost yur woman, an' her, her man, t'ree years
gone?"</p>
<p>Then Anapest, empress of all the Krauses, turned to Christian
in the boat. "Ye, Christian, steam ye back to Big Outpost an'
fetch de Reverend Green dis day, an' if he hums an' haws about
comin', say dat Anapest Kraus bid him come."</p>
<p>So the minister was fetched, and that very afternoon David and
Mary were married upon the cliff's edge, near the spot where
Gershom had had his adventure with the ram. In fact, a memory of
this incident came so vividly to David's mind that he almost
laughed in the face of the parson droning through the service.
Below them, the rhythmic sea played a grand wedding march. When
the preacher closed his book and shook the hands of the married
pair, Anapest unpacked her hamper and spread the wedding feast
upon the grass. To test reality, David pinched himself hard and
often: surely a great wave would sweep in to bear off beauty in
its undertow, leaving naught but the gravel and beach rock of
sordid reality; surely this was the magic of the Tempest. At last
they were left alone: little Ralph, wrapped in a warm blanket,
slept in the shelter of the spruces. Arms about each other, they
watched the boat vanish into mist and twilight. Then it seemed to
David that he had fulfilled his destiny, and that all the burden
of weariness had rolled from his shoulders. Life was worth
enduring if only for such an hour. He picked up the sleeping
child and, still holding Mary close to him, turned toward the
light, along the turfy path. But it was no turfy path: it was a
way of gold, full of flowers, not of this earth, but like to
those with which mediæval painters adorned their foregrounds.</p>
