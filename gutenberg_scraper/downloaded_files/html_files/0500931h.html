  <p align="center" class="note">(Douglas&mdash;The  Bushman&rsquo;s axe, so called after a famous maker.)</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s&nbsp;a  breeze about the mountains, it is singin&rsquo; in the trees<br>
    A song to mock the little men who chose to live at ease,<br>
    Or play at toil or pleasure where their fellows crowd and push;<br>
    But put my good axe in my hand and leave me in the bush&mdash;<br>
    And it&rsquo;s: Hey, boy!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi,  boy!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heave  it in the wood!<br>
    Oh, the green bush is around us, and the smell of it is good,<br>
    The great bush is before us, and a giant&rsquo;s task to do,<br>
    And hearty men and hefty men alone may see it thro&rsquo;.<br>
    So it&rsquo;s: Ho, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey,  boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swing  it with a will!<br>
    For the saws are howlin&rsquo; hungry for logs down at the mill.</p>
  <p>The  hope for man is honest work, an&rsquo; out-o&rsquo;doors his place,<br>
    The good brown earth beneath him an&rsquo; the clean breeze in his face;<br>
    The work for man is with his hands, his muscles strong as steel,<br>
    When health an&rsquo; strength within him make him feel as he should feel.<br>
    Oh it&rsquo;s: Hey, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shake  her up!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty  logs to get!<br>
    The tail-rope&rsquo;s fouled a saplin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the boss is in a sweat.<br>
    He&rsquo;s swearin&rsquo; like a trooper, for they&rsquo;re falling grubby wood;<br>
    The boy has broke the whistle-string, which isn&rsquo;t for his good.<br>
    But it&rsquo;s: Ho, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slog  along!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch  her when she goes!<br>
    An&rsquo; ringin&rsquo; down the gully runs the echo of the blows.</p>
  <p>High  above us, on the hill-top, where the tall trees rake the sky,<br>
    The cockatoos are craaking and the crimson parrots cry.<br>
    From below us, where the sawdust by the mill is gleamin&rsquo; brown,<br>
    Comes the dronin&rsquo; of the twin-saws while the boys are breakin&rsquo; down.<br>
    An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s: Ho, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let  her go!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch  her, how she sways!<br>
    An&rsquo; the loggin&rsquo; truck goes lurchin&rsquo; down the crazy wooden ways,<br>
    With the driver at the brake-rope&mdash;Oh, that truckie has a nerve!<br>
    An&rsquo; he howls a merry &ldquo;Hoop-la!&rdquo; as she swings around a curve.<br>
    Then it&rsquo;s: Hey, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plug  ahead!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feed  the greedy mill!<br>
    We have fed her logs in dozens, but she&rsquo;s shriekin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em still.</p>
  <p>When  you test the strength that&rsquo;s in you, oh, it&rsquo;s good to be alive<br>
    In the green bush, the clean bush, an&rsquo; with your fellows  strive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    There&rsquo;s Simon, of the sniggin&rsquo; gang, in trouble with his log.<br>
    An&rsquo; he slews her with a cant-hook as she wallows in a bog.<br>
    But it&rsquo;s: Hey, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady,  boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haul  away the slack!<br>
    An&rsquo; the shackled giant&rsquo;s snakin&rsquo; down the deeply-furrowed track.<br>
    Now the boss he swears to heaven that the timber&rsquo;s all bewitched,<br>
    An&rsquo; Simon toils like seven men to get the tackle hitched.<br>
    An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s: Ho, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right  away!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slew  her at the nose!<br>
    An&rsquo; the old winch coughs an&rsquo; clatters every time the whistle blows.</p>
  <p>The  crowded world may call at times, but here I&rsquo;d rather be,<br>
    With the strong men, the brown men, who work along with me;<br>
    With the good tan on their faces an&rsquo; the clear look in their eyes<br>
    That come to men who ply their trade beneath the open skies:<br>
    The rough men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  straight men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  coarse words on the tongue.<br>
    An&rsquo; hearts that work can never break an&rsquo; minds that must keep young.<br>
    Oh, it&rsquo;s swingin&rsquo;, swingin&rsquo; Douglas with a  strength you glory in,<br>
    Where willin&rsquo; hands are honoured hands, an shirkin&rsquo; is the sin&mdash;<br>
    An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s: Hi, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear,  boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More  to feed the mill!<br>
    An&rsquo; the great tree whistles downward to a crash that shakes the hill.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ALonelyMan"></a>A Lonely Man</b></h2>
  <p>When&nbsp;I&rsquo;m out among the fellows, with the  work to hold my mind,<br>
    Then there&rsquo;s heaps of joy in livin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the world seems awful kind&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awful kind an&rsquo; awful jolly, with no trace of  melancholy,<br>
    An&rsquo; I tell myself the bloke that don&rsquo;t enjoy it must be blind&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I&rsquo;m out among the fellows; but, when I am sittin&rsquo;  here,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamin&rsquo; by my lonely fireside, then the world gets  kind of queer.</p>
  <p>I suppose it&rsquo;s how you take it: what they call the point of view;<br>
    An&rsquo; a man don&rsquo;t look for dreamin&rsquo; when there&rsquo;s work for him to do.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can&rsquo;t be ever toilin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; at times he gets to  spoilin&rsquo;<br>
    All the joy the day has brought him&mdash;when he lets the black thoughts through.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suppose it&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; lonely, as a fellow never  should;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a lonely man gets broodin&rsquo;, and the broodin&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t  good.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s never good, the sayin&rsquo; is, for man to live alone.<br>
    But &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t because I like it that I&rsquo;m batchin&rsquo; on my own,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a bloke must take what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; my life ain&rsquo;t  all been growin&rsquo;<br>
    Daffodils and hummin&rsquo; dance tunes just to give my soul a tone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s muscle I&rsquo;ve had to grow since days when I was  small,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; all the muscle that I&rsquo;ve made is with the axe an&rsquo;  maul.</p>
  <p>When folks are poor an&rsquo; toil is hard an&rsquo; times are harder still<br>
    A boy soon learns the use of time if he would eat his fill.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long before I&rsquo;d finished schoolin&rsquo; I had put aside my  foolin&rsquo;.<br>
    Till now, at thirty an&rsquo; a bit, I&rsquo;m workin&rsquo; at a mill.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t much; but then my folks knew that my chance  was dim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or they might have named me Reginald instead of just  plain Jim.</p>
  <p>Just Jim the Hatter, Lonely Jim, the bloke that don&rsquo;t say much.<br>
    I&rsquo;ve heard how people talk of me: the gossipers an&rsquo; such.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; they say I&rsquo;m slow at givin&rsquo;; but I&rsquo;ve got my way of  livin&rsquo;,<br>
    An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got my bit of farm-land an&rsquo; a house that ain&rsquo;t a hutch.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; tho it hurts if this man sneers or that  misunderstands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m proud to know that all I&rsquo;ve got was earned with my  two hands.</p>
  <p>Suppose I don&rsquo;t go gay at times an&rsquo; throw around the cash:<br>
    It&rsquo;s knowin&rsquo; want that frightened me from gettin&rsquo; over rash.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I&rsquo;m keen on savin&rsquo;; but the pinchin&rsquo; and the  slavin&rsquo;<br>
    An&rsquo; the starvin&rsquo; in the old days keeps a man from bein&rsquo; flash.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never treated neighbours mean or grudged a man a  pound;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I ain&rsquo;t out to buy loud cheers by throwin&rsquo; it  around.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; after all&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it sums up much the same;<br>
    No matter how a man has lived, no matter what his aim&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it&rsquo;s savin&rsquo;, if it&rsquo;s spendin&rsquo;&mdash;all his life is just a  blendin&rsquo;<br>
    Of the gay days an&rsquo; the grey days: an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s got to play the game.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where&rsquo;s the use of grumblin&rsquo; if the game don&rsquo;t suit  your bent?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tells myself this at night&mdash;an&rsquo; yet I ain&rsquo;t content.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s days that sometimes come to me when toilin&rsquo;s simple bliss,<br>
    An&rsquo; every little job becomes a joy I wouldn&rsquo;t miss:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the labour seems like playin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I catch myself  a-sayin&rsquo;,<br>
  &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s grand to think a man gets paid for doin&rsquo; things like this!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after, came the lonely night, when I&rsquo;ve looked  back an&rsquo; said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;To think I have to slave like that to earn a bit of  bread!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When I&rsquo;m out among the fellows, oh, the world&rsquo;s a place to prize;<br>
    But here, beside my lonely fire, the glamour of it dies.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sittin&rsquo; here I take to gettin&rsquo; gloomy views of things,  an&rsquo; frettin&rsquo;<br>
    Till my dog looks up, and wonders, with a question in his eyes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s been my mate for years an&rsquo; years, an&rsquo; things that  folks don&rsquo;t see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both good an&rsquo; bad has been thrashed out by my old dog  an&rsquo; me.</p>
  <p>Well he knows he&rsquo;s safe for sharin&rsquo; while I&rsquo;ve got a bite an&rsquo; sup.<br>
    When I&rsquo;m fit, he&rsquo;s full of frolic, laughin&rsquo; like a silly pup<br>
    Out for fun. But when I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; sad at night, he just comes stealin&rsquo;<br>
    To the fire an&rsquo; stretches out there with his brown eyes lookin&rsquo; up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit with such a queer soft sadness that I feel it isn&rsquo;t  fair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own private little worries spoils the evenin&rsquo; for  the pair.</p>
  <p>Here, to-night, I&rsquo;ve sat an&rsquo; told him&mdash;while his tail flopped on  the floor&mdash;<br>
    Of particular conditions that have got me feelin&rsquo; sore.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; my present little worry is the matter of Ben Murray<br>
    An&rsquo; his sudden-like attentions to the widow at the store.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to the widow, as Ben Murray ought to  see;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I hear he&rsquo;s taken fight lately, with some reference  to me.</p>
  <p>I ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to the widow&mdash;not as yet, at any rate;<br>
    Tho&rsquo; a bloke can&rsquo;t be dead certain what is like to be his fate.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I own that I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t no  use in blinkin&rsquo;<br>
    At the fact a man must settle down before it gets too late.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain&rsquo;t nothing to the widow&mdash;don&rsquo;t know that I ever  will.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems to me it&rsquo;s awful reckless takin&rsquo; lifelong  chances&mdash;still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Me an&rsquo; my old dog&rsquo;s been talkin&rsquo; quite a lot&mdash;of love an&rsquo; things:<br>
    Weighin&rsquo; matters; an&rsquo; we reckon this here love is full of stings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuller than a stingin&rsquo; nettle. If a fellow wants to  settle<br>
    He needs solid care an&rsquo; comfort, not the stuff the poet sings.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love an&rsquo; all that talk, we reckon, is a silly sort of  fake&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s a plain man wantin&rsquo; further if his wife can wash  and bake?</p>
  <p>I ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to the widow &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Neither  is Ben Murray though!<br>
    An&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t find me unwillin&rsquo; if he wants a little go.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not over-keen on fightin&rsquo;; but his boastin&rsquo; and his  skitin&rsquo;<br>
    Puts my back up; an&rsquo; his sneerin&rsquo; often gets down pretty low.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Course, the widow&rsquo;s never mentioned&mdash;that&rsquo;s to say, by  name, outright;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I know what&rsquo;s gnawin&rsquo; at him when I hear he&rsquo;s  talking fight.</p>
  <p>Talkin&rsquo; fight an&rsquo; acting&rsquo; ugly: not reel earnest, half an&rsquo; half&mdash;<br>
    Shootin&rsquo; sneers into his smilin&rsquo;, slingin&rsquo; spite into his chaff.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho&rsquo; a fight I&rsquo;m never shirkin&rsquo;, when I&rsquo;m with the  fellows, workin&rsquo;,<br>
    I can give him good as he does, an&rsquo; just take it with a laugh.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at evenin&rsquo; when I&rsquo;m broodin&rsquo;, I chew over all the  lot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his jokes swell into insults an&rsquo; his hintin&rsquo; makes  me hot.</p>
  <p>He can have it&mdash;if he wants it! He won&rsquo;t be too long denied!<br>
    But I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s mentioned fivers&mdash;wants to fight five pounds a side.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I&rsquo;m licked, of course, I lose it; an&rsquo; that fool and  will go and booze it:<br>
    Throw it clean into the gutter with the other cash he&rsquo;s shied.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I been told to-day he&rsquo;s saying&rsquo; that his fiver saves  his skin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonder what he meant, the blighter, that should make  the fellows grin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Jumpin&rsquo; Moses!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<i>He can have it!</i>&nbsp;Anywhere  an&rsquo; anywhen!<br>
    Fivers? let him talk of fivers! Holy wars, I&rsquo;ll make it ten!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll get fightin&rsquo;, too, in plenty. If he likes I&rsquo;ll  make it twenty!<br>
    We shall see whose skin is safest an&rsquo; whose hide is toughest then.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain&rsquo;t got no grudge against him&mdash;only what the  rotter&rsquo;s said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to the widow!  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Here, old dog, we&rsquo;ll get to bed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AMorningSong"></a>A Morning Song</b></h2>
  <p>The thrush&nbsp;is in the wattle tree, an&rsquo;, &ldquo;O, you pretty dear!&rdquo;<br>
    He&rsquo;s callin&rsquo; to his little wife for all the bush to hear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s wantin&rsquo; all the bush to know about his charmin&rsquo;  hen;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sings it over fifty times, an&rsquo; then begins again.<br>
    For it&rsquo;s Mornin&rsquo;! Mornin&rsquo;! The world is wet with dew,<br>
    With tiny drops a-twinkle where the sun comes shinin&rsquo; thro&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>The thrush is in the wattle tree, red robin&rsquo;s underneath,<br>
    The little blue-cap&rsquo;s dodgin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; out amongst the heath;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; they&rsquo;re singin&rsquo;, boy, they&rsquo;re singin&rsquo; like they&rsquo;d  bust &rsquo;emselves to bits;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, up above, old Laughin&rsquo; Jack is having forty  fits.<br>
    For it&rsquo;s Mornin&rsquo;! Mornin&rsquo;! The leaves are all ashine:<br>
    There&rsquo;s treasure all about the place; an&rsquo; all of it is mine.</p>
  <p>Oh, it&rsquo;s good to be a wealthy man, it&rsquo;s grand to be a king<br>
    With mornin&rsquo; on the forest-land an&rsquo; joy in everything.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s fine to be a healthy man with healthy work to do<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the singin&rsquo; land, the clean land, washed again with  dew.<br>
    When sunlight slants across the trees, an&rsquo; birds begin to sing,<br>
    Then kings may snore in palaces, but I&rsquo;m awake&mdash;and king.</p>
  <p>But the king must cook his breakfast, an&rsquo; the king must sweep the  floor;<br>
    Then out with axe on shoulder to his kingdom at the door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His old dog sportin&rsquo; on ahead, his troubles all behind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; joy mixed in the blood of him because the world is  kind.<br>
    For it&rsquo;s Mornin&rsquo;! Mornin&rsquo;! Time to out an&rsquo; strive!<br>
    Oh, there&rsquo;s not a thing I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; else but just to be alive!</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s cranky moods a man will get an&rsquo; funny ways of mind;<br>
    For I&rsquo;ve a memory of one whose thoughts were all unkind:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sat an&rsquo; brooded thro&rsquo; the night beside the blazin&rsquo;  log,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His home a mirthless, silent house, his only pal a dog.<br>
    But it&rsquo;s Mornin&rsquo;! Mornin&rsquo;! I nurse no thought but praise,<br>
    I&rsquo;ve more good friends than I could count, tho&rsquo; I should count for days.</p>
  <p>My friends are in the underbrush, my friends are in the trees,<br>
    An&rsquo; merrily they welcome me with mornin&rsquo; melodies.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, below, from bush an&rsquo; bough each calls his  tuneful part;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; best of all, one trusty friend is callin&rsquo; in my  heart.<br>
    For it&rsquo;s Mornin&rsquo;! Mornin&rsquo;! When night&rsquo;s black troubles end.<br>
    An&rsquo; never man was friendless yet who stayed his own good friend.</p>
  <p>Ben Murray, he&rsquo;s no friend of mine, an&rsquo; well I know the same;<br>
    But why should I be thinkin&rsquo; hate, an&rsquo; nursin&rsquo; thoughts of blame?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last evenin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d no friend within, but troubles all  around,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; madly thought to fight a man for ten or twenty  pound.<br>
    But it&rsquo;s Mornin&rsquo;! Mornin&rsquo;! my friend within&rsquo;s alive,<br>
    An&rsquo; he&rsquo;d never risk a twenty&mdash;tho&rsquo; he might consider five.</p>
  <p>But where&rsquo;s the call to think of strife with such good things  about?<br>
    The gum-leaves are a-twinkle as the sun comes peepin&rsquo; out.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-cap&rsquo;s in an&rsquo; out the fern, red robin&rsquo;s on the  gate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; who could hear the song of them and hold a thought  of hate?<br>
    Oh, it&rsquo;s Mornin&rsquo;! Mornin&rsquo;! No time for thinkin&rsquo; wrong.<br>
    An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be scared to strike a man, I feel so awful strong.</p>
  <p>Grey thrush is in the wattle, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s, &ldquo;O, you pretty dear!&rdquo;<br>
    He&rsquo;s callin&rsquo; to his little wife, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t care who should hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great bush, the fresh bush, washed again with  dew.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; my axe is on my shoulder, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s work ahead to  do.<br>
    Oh, it&rsquo;s Mornin&rsquo;! Singin&rsquo; Mornin&rsquo;! in the land I count the best,<br>
    An&rsquo; with the heart an&rsquo; mind of me I&rsquo;m singin&rsquo; with the rest.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AFreakofSpring"></a>A Freak of Spring</b></h2>
  <p>At any other time of year<br>
    It might have passed, but Spring is queer.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says somethin&rsquo;&mdash;I dunno&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somethin&rsquo; nasty. I says, &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Ho, yourself!&rdquo; he says, an&rsquo; glares.<br>
    I says nothin&rsquo;&mdash;only stares.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Coot!&rdquo; says he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Then up she goes!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; I land him on the nose.</p>
  <p><i>It was Spring, Spring, Spring! Just to hear the thrushes sing<br>

    So I fetches him a beauty with a lovely left-arm swing.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Murray staggered back a bit an&rsquo; howled a wicked  word<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which gave me feelin&rsquo;s of great  joy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s how it occurred.</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the sawdust!&rdquo; yells old Pike,<br>
    Gloatin&rsquo; and bloodthirsty-like.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;On the sawdust with yeh both!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth to tell, I&rsquo;m nothin&rsquo; loth.<br>
    I peel off my coat an&rsquo; vest.<br>
    Murray, with  his rage suppressed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes up eager, pale with spite.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Glory!&rdquo; shouts old Pike. &ldquo;A fight!&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>It was Spring, glad Spring, an&rsquo; the swallows on the wing<br>
    Made a man feel kind an&rsquo; peaceful with their cheery twittering.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I watched their graceful wheelin&rsquo; with a pleasant  sort of feelin&rsquo;<br>
    Old man Pike pulled out his ticker, an&rsquo; the mill-hands made a ring.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was gold upon the wattle an&rsquo; the blackwood was in  bud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; I felt the call for action fairly sizzin&rsquo; in my  blood.</i> </p>
  <p>Murray comes on like a bull;<br>
    Both his eyes with spleen are full.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him have it&mdash;left an&rsquo;  right.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pike is bustin&rsquo; with  delight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    Right eye once and left eye twice&mdash;<br>
    Then he grabs me like a vice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down into the dust we go&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull-dog grip and short-arm blow.</p>
  <p><i>It was Spring! Mad Spring! Just to feel him clutch an&rsquo; cling<br>
    Told me plain that life was splendid an&rsquo; my strength a precious thing.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sawdust heap we scrambled, while the fellows  yelled an&rsquo; gambled<br>
    On the fight; an&rsquo; Ben loosed curse-words in a never-endin&rsquo; string.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I glimpsed the soft sky shinin&rsquo; and I smelled the  fresh-cut wood;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; as we rolled I pummelled him, an&rsquo; knew the world  was good.</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t a dog-fight!&rdquo; shouts Bob Blair.<br>
  &ldquo;Stand up straight an&rsquo; fight it fair.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get end-up with a grin.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; yells Pike, an&rsquo; bangs a tin.<br>
  &ldquo;Corners, boys. A minute&rsquo;s spell.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Good lad, Jim! You&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; well,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says the little Dusty, Dick.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murray&rsquo;s  eye is closin&rsquo; quick.</p>
  <p><i>It was Spring, sweet Spring, an&rsquo; a man must have his fling:<br>
    Healthy men must be respondin&rsquo; to the moods the seasons bring.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sweet air, with scrub scents laden, all my body  was invadin&rsquo;,<br>
    Till each breath I drew within me made me feel I was king.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas the season to be doin&rsquo;&mdash;fondlin&rsquo; maids, or  fightin&rsquo; men&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; I felt my spirit yearnin&rsquo; for another crack at Ben.</i> </p>
  <p>Pike bangs on his tin again.<br>
  &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; he roars. &ldquo;Get to it, men!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come eager, fit to dance;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben spars cautious for a chance.<br>
    With a laugh I flick him light;<br>
    Then&mdash;like lightin&rsquo; comes his right<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full an&rsquo; fair upon the jaw&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, the purple stars I saw!</p>
  <p><i>It was Spring, wild Spring! When I felt the sudden sting<br>
    Of a clout all unexpected, I was just a maddened thing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a savage male thing ragin&rsquo;; battle all my wits  engagin&rsquo;.<br>
    Instant I was up an&rsquo; at him, an&rsquo; I punched him round the ring.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot the scents an&rsquo; season; I lost count of time  an&rsquo; place;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; my only aim an&rsquo; object was to batter Murray&rsquo;s face.</i> </p>
  <p>Pike is dancin&rsquo; wild with joy;<br>
    Dusty Dick howls, &ldquo;At him, boy!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am at him, fast an&rsquo; hard.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as Murray  drops his guard,<br>
    I get in one, strong an&rsquo; straight,<br>
    Full of enmity an&rsquo; weight.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down he goes; the fellows shout.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;One!&rdquo; starts Pike,  then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ten&mdash;an&rsquo; out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>It was Spring, gay Spring. Still were swallows on the wing,<br>
    An&rsquo;, on a sudden, once again I heard the thrushes sing.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was gold upon the wattle, an&rsquo; my recent wish to  throttle<br>
    Murray, as he  lay there groanin&rsquo;, was a far-forgotten thing.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the soft blue sky were sailin&rsquo; little clouds as fine  as fluff.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wantin&rsquo; more?&rdquo; I asked him gently; but Ben Murray  said, &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo;</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well done, Jim,&rdquo; says old Bob Blair.<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the brave deserves the fair.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; he laughs an&rsquo; winks at Pike<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way that I don&rsquo;t like.<br>
  &ldquo;Widders,&rdquo; grins young Dusty Dick,<br>
  &ldquo;Likes a bloke whose hands is quick.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now poor Ben can take the sack.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I frowns, an&rsquo; turns my back.</p>
  <p><i>It was Spring, the fickle Spring; an&rsquo; a most amazin&rsquo; thing<br>
    Came upon me sudden-like an&rsquo; set me marvellin&rsquo;.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For no longer was I lookin&rsquo; for a wife to do my  cookin&rsquo;,<br>
    But for somethin&rsquo; sweet and tender of the kind that kiss an&rsquo; cling.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, for such a one I&rsquo;d battle, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d win by hook or  crook;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it did seem sort of foolish to go fightin&rsquo; for a  cook.</i> </p>
  <p>Standin&rsquo; on the sawdust heap<br>
    I feel mean an&rsquo; rather cheap,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Widows? Let the widow go!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we fought for I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
    Murray offers  me his hand:<br>
  &ldquo;Jim, you&rsquo;ve won; so understand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t mean to block your road . . .&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I answer, &ldquo;That be blowed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Spring, man, Spring!&rdquo; (An&rsquo; I gave his fist a wring)<br>
  &ldquo;If you reckoned me your rival, give up thinkin&rsquo; such a thing.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just fought for fun an&rsquo; frolic, so don&rsquo;t you get  melancholic;<br>
    An&rsquo;, if you have notions yonder, why, buck up an&rsquo; buy the ring!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put some beefsteak on your eye, lad, an&rsquo; learn how to  keep your guard.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I put my coat an&rsquo; vest on, an&rsquo; walked  homeward&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thinkin&rsquo; hard.</i> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheVision"></a>The Vision</b></h2>
  <p>Of things&nbsp;that roam about the bush I ain&rsquo;t got many fears,<br>
    For I knows their ways an&rsquo; habits, and I&rsquo;ve chummed with them for years.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For man or beast or gully ghost I&rsquo;ve pluck enough to  spare;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I draws the line at visions with the sunlight in  their hair.</p>
  <p>When a man has fought an&rsquo; conquered it is good in many ways:<br>
    There&rsquo;s the pride in having done it, an&rsquo; the other fellows&rsquo; praise;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s the glory an&rsquo; the standin&rsquo; that you get among  the men&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All their looks are more respectful since I socked it  into Ben.</p>
  <p>I was feelin&rsquo; fine this mornin&rsquo; when I started out to work;<br>
    An&rsquo; I caught myself high-steppin&rsquo; with a boastful sort of jerk;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my head a trifle higher an&rsquo; my eye a little stern.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the world was mine for keeps; but I&rsquo;d a lot  to learn.</p>
  <p>Young Dick, the Dusty, wasn&rsquo;t half as cheeky as of old;<br>
    The men were actin&rsquo; friendly-like, but I kept kind of cold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; distant, as becomes a bloke who&rsquo;s scored a  knock-out thump&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till just approachin&rsquo; dinner time; an&rsquo; then I got my  bump.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s fine to see your cobbers lookin&rsquo; at you like they know<br>
    You&rsquo;re not a man to trifle with; at least, I found it so.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Murray was quite affable, an&rsquo; once he whispered me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a certain somethin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll see me  privately.</p>
  <p>I was workin&rsquo; at the rip saw, cursin&rsquo; at my achin&rsquo; back,<br>
    When I saw the blessed vision comin&rsquo; down the log-yard track.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were others in the party, but the one that got my  stare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was her with two brown, laughin&rsquo; eyes an&rsquo; sunlight in  her hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More visitors!&rdquo; growled old man Pike. &ldquo;Another city push.<br>
    I&rsquo;ll bet a quid they ask us why we &lsquo;spoil the lovely bush.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hardly heard him saying it, for like a fool I stand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes full of the vision an&rsquo; a batten in my hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You gone to sleep?&rdquo; the sawyer said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you mesmerized?&rdquo;<br>
    I start to work like fury, but my thoughts can&rsquo;t be disguised.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Oh, Jim&rsquo;s gone dippy with the Spring&rdquo;; replies old  Pike an&rsquo; grins.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to answer dignified; but trip, an&rsquo; bark my  shins.</p>
  <p>Next thing I know the boss is there, an&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; fine an&rsquo; good.<br>
    Explainin&rsquo; to the visitors how trees are made of wood.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They murmur things like &ldquo;Marvellous!&rdquo; an&rsquo; &ldquo;What a  monster tree!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; then the one with sunlit hair comes right bang up  to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw you fall,&rdquo; she sort of sung: you couldn&rsquo;t say she talked,<br>
    For her voice had springtime in it, like the way she looked an&rsquo; walked.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I saw you fall,&rdquo; she sung at me. &ldquo;I hope you were not  hurt.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; suddenly I was aware I wore my oldest shirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It never hurt me half as much as your two smilin&rsquo; eyes.&rdquo;<br>
    That&rsquo;s how I could have answered her&mdash;and watched old Pike&rsquo;s surprise&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It never harmed me half as much as standin&rsquo; here like  this<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tattered shirt an&rsquo; grimy  hands&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But I just says, &ldquo;No, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pretty hard, an&rsquo; have to take them  cracks.&rdquo;<br>
    (But just to see her sudden smile, made me as soft as wax.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re strong,&rdquo; she smiles. I answers, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m pretty  strong, all right.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; close behind I heard old Pike observin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Hear &rsquo;im  skite!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That finished me. I lost what little nerve I had, an&rsquo; grew<br>
    Dead certain that I looked a fool, an&rsquo; that she thought so, too.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked some more; but I can&rsquo;t tell what other  things she said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went all cold, except my ears, an&rsquo; they were burnin&rsquo;  red.</p>
  <p>I only knew her eyes were soft, her voice was kind an&rsquo; low.<br>
    I never spoke another word exceptin&rsquo; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; an&rsquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never felt a bigger chump in all my livin&rsquo; days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well knowin&rsquo; I was gettin&rsquo; worse at every word she  says.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; when she went off with the rest I stood there, lookin&rsquo; sick.<br>
    Until I caught a chance remark of little Dirty Dick.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What price the widders now?&rdquo; says he. I answer fierce  an&rsquo; low:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Were you addressin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; I says; an&rsquo; Dick was prompt  with &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know how I finished up; my thoughts were far from clear;<br>
    For, in between me an&rsquo; the bench, that vision would appear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other man chucked off at me, but by their looks  &rsquo;twas plain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d lost a bit of that respect it took a fight to gain.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo;, when the knock-off whistle blew, Ben Murray he came by,<br>
    An&rsquo; says he&rsquo;d like that private talk, but, &ldquo;Pickle it,&rdquo; says I.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill have to keep till later on.&rdquo; He answers, &ldquo;As  you like.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after that I saw him talkin&rsquo; earnest with old  Pike.</p>
  <p>If I&rsquo;d been right, I might have known there&rsquo;s something in the air<br>
    By the way the blokes were actin&rsquo;; but a fat lot did I care.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swell visions an&rsquo; the deadly pip was what was wrong  with me.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slung a word to my old dog, an&rsquo; we trudged home to  tea.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; after, in the same old way, we sits beside the fire,<br>
    To have a talk, my dog an&rsquo; me, on fools an&rsquo; vain desire.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell him I&rsquo;m a silly chump to think the things I do.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo;, with a waggle of his tail, he says he thinks so  too.</p>
  <p>I tell him I suppose she&rsquo;s rich, or so she seems to be;<br>
    Most likely some reel city swell&mdash;an&rsquo; he don&rsquo;t disagree.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I says to him the chances are I&rsquo;ll not see her no more.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he gives me a funny look, an&rsquo; curls up on the  floor.</p>
  <p>But I was slow to take the tip, an&rsquo; went on talkin&rsquo; rot<br>
    About injustice in the world, an&rsquo; boiled up good an&rsquo; hot.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spouts of wrongs of workin&rsquo; men an&rsquo; how our rulers  fail.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are shut, but he just seconds motions with his  tail.</p>
  <p>All beauty&rsquo;s only for the rich, all times, an&rsquo; every way.<br>
    The toilers just take what is left, as I&rsquo;ve heard Murray say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he&rsquo;s been talkin&rsquo; to the boys about the workers&rsquo;  rights,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; spoutin&rsquo; of equality, down at the huts, of nights.</p>
  <p>I turned the social system inside-out for my old dog.<br>
    Tho&rsquo; he don&rsquo;t seem much entertained, but lies there like a log.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke of common people&rsquo;s wrongs&mdash;especially of mine;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I came to mention love I thought I heard him  whine.</p>
  <p>But I went on, an&rsquo; said straight out that, tho&rsquo; I seemed above<br>
    Such nonsense once, I&rsquo;d changed a bit, an&rsquo; I believed in love.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said love was a splendid  thing!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Then, true as I am born,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose, an&rsquo; yawned, an&rsquo; shut me up with one crook  glance of scorn.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s bad enough to be a bloke without one reel close friend;<br>
    But when your dog gives you the bird it&rsquo;s pretty near the end.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashamed, I sneaked away to bunk; an&rsquo; fell to dreamin&rsquo;  there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a little brown-eyed vision with the sunlight in her  hair.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OldBobBlair"></a>Old Bob Blair</b></h2>
  <p>I&nbsp;got&nbsp;so down to it last night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With longin&rsquo; for what could not be,<br>
    That nothin&rsquo; in the world seemed right&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or everything was wrong with me.<br>
    My house was just a lonely hole,<br>
    An&rsquo; I had blisters on my soul.</p>
  <p>Top of my other worries now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are talkin&rsquo; strike, an&rsquo; say<br>
    If we put up a sudden row<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re sure of forcin&rsquo; up our pay.<br>
    I&rsquo;m right enough with what I get;<br>
    But some wants more, an&rsquo; then more yet.</p>
  <p>Ben Murray&rsquo;s put it up to me:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says I got some influence<br>
    Amongst them, if I agree&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Which I will do if I have sense&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
    We&rsquo;ll make the boss cough up a bit.<br>
    That&rsquo;s how Ben Murray looks at it.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know that the old boss can.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s pushed to make ends meet.<br>
    To me he&rsquo;s been a fair, straight man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pays up well an&rsquo; works a treat.<br>
    But if I don&rsquo;t get in this game,<br>
    Well, &ldquo;blackleg&rdquo; ain&rsquo;t a pretty name.</p>
  <p>This thing has got me thinkin&rsquo; hard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is worse upon my mind.<br>
    What sort of luck has broke my guard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should be the man to find<br>
    A girl like that?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The whole world&rsquo;s wrong!<br>
    Why was I born to live and long?</p>
  <p>I get so down to it last night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With broodin&rsquo; over things like this,<br>
    I said &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a thing in sight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worth havin&rsquo; but I seem to miss.&rdquo;<br>
    So I go out and get some air<br>
    An&rsquo; have a word with old Bob Blair.</p>
  <p>Bob&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; lonely, same as me;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he don&rsquo;t take to frettin&rsquo; so<br>
    An&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; megrims after tea.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reads a lot at night, I know;<br>
    His hut has books half up the wall<br>
    That I don&rsquo;t tumble to at all.</p>
  <p>Books all about them ancient blokes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lived a thousand years ago:<br>
    Philosophers an&rsquo; funny folk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he sees in them I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
    There ain&rsquo;t much fun, when all is said,<br>
    In chaps that is so awful dead.</p>
  <p>He put his book down when I came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his specs off, patient-like.<br>
    He&rsquo;s been in Rome;  an&rsquo; who can blame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man if he gets the spike<br>
    To be jerked back so suddenly<br>
    By some glum-lookin&rsquo; coot like me.</p>
  <p>At first he looks at me quite dazed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tho&rsquo; &rsquo;twas hard to recognize<br>
    The silly fool at which he gazed;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; then a smile come in his eyes:<br>
  &ldquo;Why, Jim,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Still feelin&rsquo; blue?<br>
    Kiss her, an&rsquo; laugh!&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But I says, &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, who, if not the widow, lad?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I says, &ldquo;Widows ain&rsquo;t no go.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;What woman, then, makes you so sad?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I coughs a bit an&rsquo; says, &ldquo;Dunno.&rdquo;<br>
    He looked at me, then old Bob Blair<br>
    He ran his fingers through his hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God help us, but the case is bad!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; men below, an&rsquo; saints above<br>
    Look with mixed feelin&rsquo;s, sour an&rsquo; sad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a fool in love with love.<br>
    Go, find her, lad, an&rsquo; be again,<br>
    Fit to associate with men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave yourself upon the shelf:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s bad for man to live alone.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;What ails yourself?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;doin&rsquo; on your own?&rdquo;<br>
    Quickly he turned away his head.<br>
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>I saw I&rsquo;d made a clumsy break;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; tied to cover it with talk<br>
    Of anything, for old Blair&rsquo;s sake.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He don&rsquo;t reply; but when I&rsquo;d walk<br>
    Outside he says, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear<br>
    About the mill boys actin&rsquo; queer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So then we yarns about the strike,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; old Bob Brown frowns an&rsquo; shakes his head.<br>
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something there I hardly like;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss has acted fair,&rdquo; he said.<br>
  &ldquo;Eight years I&rsquo;ve toiled here constantly,<br>
    An&rsquo; boss an&rsquo; friend he&rsquo;s been to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s up against it bad;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stintin&rsquo; himself to pay the men.<br>
    Don&rsquo;t listen to this tattle, lad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; leave that dirty work to Ben.<br>
    He tries to play on others need;<br>
    It&rsquo;s partly devil, partly greed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ben&rsquo;s not a reel bad lot at heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ignorant an&rsquo; dull of sight,<br>
    An&rsquo; crazed by these new creeds that start<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; grow like mushrooms, overnight;<br>
    An&rsquo; this strange greed that&rsquo;s spread the more<br>
    Since the great sacrifice of war.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Greed everywhere!&rdquo; sighed old man Blair.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Master an&rsquo; man have caught the craze;<br>
    An&rsquo; those who yesterday would share<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like brothers, now spend all their days<br>
    Snatchin&rsquo; for gain&mdash;the great, the small.<br>
    And, oh, the folly of it all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tapped the small book by his hand.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Two thousand years ago they knew<br>
    That those who think an&rsquo; understand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make their wants but very few.<br>
    Two thousand years they taught<br>
    That happiness can not be bought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Progress?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Bah! A fig!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the things that count or last<br>
    In buildin&rsquo; something very big<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or goin&rsquo; somewhere very fast?<br>
    We put the horse behind the cart;<br>
    For where&rsquo;s your progress of the heart?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great wisdom lived long years ago,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; yet we say that we progress.<br>
    The paint an&rsquo; tinsel of our show<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are men more generous, or kind?<br>
    Then where&rsquo;s your progress of the mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>(I think Bob Blair&rsquo;s a trifle mad;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say so, too, around these parts;<br>
    An&rsquo; he can be, when he&rsquo;s reel bad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holy terror once he starts.<br>
    Dare say it&rsquo;s readin&rsquo; books an&rsquo; such.<br>
    Thank God I never read too much!)</p>
  <p>I says I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all this progress gets to now.<br>
    He smiles a bit an&rsquo; answers low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll find out, lad, somehow.<br>
    But talkin&rsquo; makes my old head whirl;<br>
    So you be off, an&rsquo;&mdash;find that girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I says Good night, an&rsquo; out I goes;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was hardly at the door<br>
    When his old specs is on his nose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; his book in his hand once more;<br>
    An&rsquo;, as I take the track for home,<br>
    Bob Blair goes back to Ancient Rome.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheWooer"></a>The Wooer</b></h2>
  <p>I&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;fell fair in my tracks.<br>
    I&rsquo;m trudgin&rsquo; homeward with my axe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I come on her suddenly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;m lost?&rdquo; says she.<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s risky on such roads as this.&rdquo;<br>
    I lifts my hat an&rsquo; says, &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew &rsquo;twas rude for me to stare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, oh, that sunlight in her hair!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;m lost?&rsquo; says she,<br>
    An&rsquo; gives a smile that staggers me.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;An&rsquo; yet, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter much<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing that I was, with such<br>
    A glorious green world about,<br>
    With bits of blue sky peepin&rsquo; out.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;think there will be a fog?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, miss,&rdquo; says I, an&rsquo; pats my dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what a dear old dog!&rdquo; says she.<br>
  &ldquo;Most dogs are pretty fond of me.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calls him to her, an&rsquo; he goes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He didn&rsquo;t find it hard, I s&rsquo;pose;<br>
    I know I wouldn&rsquo;t if she called.)<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wondrous how the tracks are walled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these great trees that touch the sky<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On either side.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; says I.</p>
  <p>She fondles my old dog a bit;<br>
    I wait to make a bolt for it.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There ain&rsquo;t no call to stand an&rsquo; talk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one who&rsquo;d be too proud to walk<br>
    A half-a-yard with such as me.)<br>
  &ldquo;The wind keeps workin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; says she.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; says I, an&rsquo; lifts me hat.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; she just let&rsquo;s it go at that.</p>
  <p>She let me reach the dribblin&rsquo; ford&mdash;<br>
    That day to me it fairly roared.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(At least, that&rsquo;s how the thing appears;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But blood was poundin&rsquo; in my ears.)<br>
    She waits till I have fairly crossed:<br>
  &ldquo;I thought I told you I was lost?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cries. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you go walkin&rsquo; off,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite scornful, like some proud bush toff!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She got me thinkin&rsquo; hard with that.<br>
  &ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; I says, an&rsquo; lifts my hat.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she just waits there on the track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; lets me walk the whole way back.<br>
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; are you reely lost?&rdquo; says I.<br>
  &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; says she an&rsquo; drops her eye. . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait, an&rsquo; wait for what seems days;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not another word she says.</p>
  <p>I pats my dog, an&rsquo; lifts my hat;<br>
    But she don&rsquo;t seem to notice that.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looks up trees an&rsquo; stares at logs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; long for twenty hats an&rsquo; dogs.<br>
  &ldquo;The weather&rsquo;s kept reel good to-day,&rdquo;<br>
    I blurts at last. Say she, &ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; she says, an&rsquo; then, &ldquo;Encore!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; gets me wonderin&rsquo; what for.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this the right road to &lsquo;The Height?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
    I tell her it&rsquo;s the road, all right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that the way she&rsquo;s walkin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that she looked like she would faint.<br>
  &ldquo;Then I <i>was</i> lost if I had gone<br>
    Along this road an&rsquo; walked right on&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unfrequented bush track, too!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fortunate that I met you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;what?&rdquo; says she.<br>
    Says I, &ldquo;Most fortunate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for me.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know where I found the pluck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To blurt that out an&rsquo; chance my luck.<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll walk,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;a short way back,<br>
    So you can put me on the track?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;the way,&rdquo; says I,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; looks her fair bang in the eye.</p>
  <p>Later, I let myself right out,<br>
    An&rsquo; talked: an&rsquo; told her all about<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things I&rsquo;ve done, an&rsquo; what I do,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; nearly all I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; to.<br>
    Told why I chose the game I&rsquo;m at<br>
    Because my folks were poor, an&rsquo; that.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seemed reel pleased to hear me talk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; sort of steadied up the walk.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; when I&rsquo;d spoke my little bit,<br>
    She just takes up the thread of it;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; later on, near knocks me down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By tellin&rsquo; me she&nbsp;<i>works</i>&mdash;in town.<br>
    Works? her? I thought, the way she dressed,<br>
    She was quite rich; but she confessed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makin&rsquo; dresses was her game,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; she was dead sick of the same.</p>
  <p>When Good bye came, I lifts my hat;<br>
    But she holds out her hand at that.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at mine, all stained with sap,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; told her I&rsquo;m a reel rough chap.<br>
  &ldquo;A worker&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; says she, reel fine,<br>
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; marked with toil; but so is mine.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re just two toilers; let us shake,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; be good friends&mdash;for labour&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t care to say no more,<br>
    For fear of what she&rsquo;d take me for&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just Good bye, an&rsquo; turns away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bustin&rsquo; with things I had to say.<br>
    I don&rsquo;t know how I got right home.<br>
    The wonder was I didn&rsquo;t roam<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off in the scrub, an&rsquo; dream out there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her with sunlight in her hair.</p>
  <p>At home I looks around the place,<br>
    An&rsquo; sees the dirt&rsquo;s a fair disgrace;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So takes an&rsquo; tidies up a bit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; has a shave; an&rsquo; then I sit<br>
    Beside my fire to have a think.<br>
    But my old dog won&rsquo;t sleep a wink;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fools, an&rsquo; whines, an&rsquo; nudges me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all at once I thinks of tea.</p>
  <p>I beg his pardon with a smile,<br>
    An&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; to him all the while,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get it ready, tellin&rsquo; him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About that girl; but, &ldquo;Shut up, Jim!&rdquo;<br>
    He says to me as plain as plain.<br>
  &ldquo;First have some food, an&rsquo; then explain.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I don&rsquo;t know how she came to tell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I found out her name is Nell.)</p>
  <p>We gets our bit to eat at last.<br>
    (An&rsquo;, just for spite, he et his fast)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that Nell&rsquo;s a reel nice  name&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All right, old dog, I ain&rsquo;t to blame<br>
    If you&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Just as I go to sup<br>
    My tea I stop dead, with my cup<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half up, an&rsquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;By the Holy  Frost!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder was Nell reely lost?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="RedRobin"></a>Red Robin</b></h2>
  <p>Hi,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a funny world! This mornin&rsquo; when I woke<br>
    I saw red robin on the fence, an&rsquo; heard the words he spoke.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red robin, he&rsquo;s a perky chap, an&rsquo; this was his refrain:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dear, it&rsquo;s a pity that poor Jenny is so plain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To talk like that about his wife! It had me scandalized.<br>
    I&rsquo;d heard him singin&rsquo; so before, but never recognised<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of his chatter, or that he could be so  vain:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dear, it&rsquo;s a pity that poor Jenny is so plain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know how, I don&rsquo;t know why, but this reminded me<br>
    I was promised to the widow for this Sunday night to tea.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d promised her for weeks an&rsquo; weeks, until she pinned  me down.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recollects this is the day, an&rsquo; gets up with a frown.</p>
  <p>I was thinkin&rsquo; of the widow while I gets me clobber on&mdash;<br>
    Like a feller will start thinkin&rsquo; of the times that&rsquo;s past an&rsquo; gone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo;, while my thoughts is runnin&rsquo; so, that bird chips  in again:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dear, it&rsquo;s a pity that poor Jenny is so plain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now, the widow&rsquo;s name is Jenny, an&rsquo; it strikes me sort of queer<br>
    That my thoughts should be upon her when that robin&rsquo;s song I hear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ain&rsquo;t so homely neither; but she never could  compare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a certain bonzer vision with the sunlight in her  hair.</p>
  <p>When I wander down that evenin&rsquo;, she come smilin&rsquo; to the gate,<br>
    An&rsquo; her look is calculatin&rsquo;, as she scolds because I&rsquo;m late.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She takes my hat an&rsquo; sits me down an&rsquo; heaves a little  sigh.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I get a queer sensation from that glimmer in her  eye.</p>
  <p>She starts to talk about the mill, an&rsquo; then about the strike,<br>
    An&rsquo; then she digs Ben Murray up an&rsquo; treats him nasty-like;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She treats him crool an&rsquo; cattish, as them soft, sweet  women can.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I ups an&rsquo; tells her plainly that I think Ben is a  man.</p>
  <p>First round to me. But she comes back, an&rsquo; says Ben is a cad<br>
    Who&rsquo;s made a laughin&rsquo;-stock of her, an&rsquo; treated her reel bad.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I twig she&rsquo;s out for sympathy; so counters that, an&rsquo;  says<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Ben&rsquo;s a broken-hearted man about the mill these  days.</p>
  <p>The second round to me on points; an&rsquo; I was havin&rsquo; hopes.<br>
    (I might have known that widows were familiar with the ropes.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But he&rsquo;d never make a husband!&rdquo; says the widow, with a  sigh.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; again I gets a warnin&rsquo; from that glimmer in her  eye.</p>
  <p>I says I ain&rsquo;t no judge of that; an&rsquo; treats it with a laugh.<br>
    But she keeps the talk on husbands for a minute an&rsquo; a half.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t do much but spar a bit, an&rsquo; keep her out of  range;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the third round is the widow&rsquo;s; an&rsquo; the fight takes  on a change.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m longin&rsquo; for a breather, for I&rsquo;ve done my nerve a lot,<br>
    When suddenly she starts on &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; an&rsquo; makes the pace reel hot.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half a jiff she has me on the ropes, an&rsquo; breathin&rsquo;  hard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With not a fight inside me&mdash;I can only duck an&rsquo; guard.</p>
  <p>She uppercuts me with a sigh, an&rsquo; jabs me with a glance.<br>
    (When a widow is the fighter, has a single bloke a chance?)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her short-arm blows are amorous, most lovin&rsquo; is her  lunge;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it&rsquo;s just a touch an&rsquo; go I don&rsquo;t throw up the  sponge.</p>
  <p>I use my head-piece here a bit to wriggle from the fix;<br>
    For the widow is a winner &rsquo;less I fluke a win by tricks.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; I lets a reel mean notion (that I don&rsquo;t seek to  excuse),<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I interrupts her rudely with, &ldquo;But have you heard  the news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now, to a woman, that&rsquo;s a lead dead certain of a score,<br>
    An&rsquo; a question that the keenest is unable to ignore.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; good old Curiosity comes in to second me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I saw her struggle hopeless, an&rsquo; &ldquo;What news is  that?&rdquo; says she.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; here I spins a lovely yarn, a gloomy hard-luck tale<br>
    Of how I&rsquo;ve done my money in, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m about to fail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How my house an&rsquo; land is mortgaged, how I&rsquo;ve muddled my  affairs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through foolin&rsquo; round with racin&rsquo; bets and rotten  minin&rsquo; shares.</p>
  <p>I saw the fight was easy mine the minute I begun;<br>
    An&rsquo;, after half a dozen words, the time-keep counted &ldquo;One.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; when I finish that sad tale there ain&rsquo;t the  slightest doubt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am winner of the contest, an&rsquo; the widow&rsquo;s down an&rsquo;  out.</p>
  <p>But not for long. Although she&rsquo;s lost, the widow is dead game:<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mister Jim,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;for both your loss an&rsquo; shame.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things is changed between us now, of course; the past  is dead.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; what you were about to say you please will leave  unsaid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b> </p>
  <p>I was thinkin&rsquo; in the evenin&rsquo; over how I had escaped,<br>
    An&rsquo; how the widow took it all&mdash;the way she stared an&rsquo; gaped.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked her plainest at that time; but that don&rsquo;t  matter now;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, plain or fair, I know of one who&rsquo;s fairer, anyhow.</p>
  <p>I tells meself that beauty ain&rsquo;t a thing to count with man,<br>
    An&rsquo; I would never choose a wife on that unthinkin&rsquo; plan.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No robin was awake, I swear; but still I heard that  strain;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dear, it&rsquo;s a pity that poor Jenny is so plain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MurraysRide"></a>Murray</b><b>&rsquo;s Ride</b></h2>
  <p>I&nbsp;seldom&nbsp;get to hatin&rsquo; men, nor had much  cause to hate;<br>
    To me, it just a foolish game to play, at any rate.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it kills the hard thought in you, an&rsquo; forgiveness  is complete,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the man you hated once a maimed thing at your  feet.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;d had a meetin&rsquo; at the mill; the boss had said his say&mdash;<br>
    The good old boss, who stints himself to find the men their pay&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told us, fair an&rsquo; honest, he was up against the game<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless he got the timber out before the Winter came.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll say this much for decent men&mdash;an&rsquo; decent men they were&mdash;<br>
    They saw the game that Murray  played to give the boss a scare.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw he&rsquo;d pay near anything and Ben would do him  brown;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a fair thing is a fair thing; so we turned Ben  Murray down.</p>
  <p>A truck was waitin&rsquo; in the yard, full-loaded for the trip.<br>
    Just an easin&rsquo; of the brake-rope was enough to let her rip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half a mile or more down-hill along a track,  rough-made,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where the horses wait to haul her up the other  grade.</p>
  <p>The talk was done, the numbers up, the boss had won the day,<br>
    An&rsquo; we were ready to go back an&rsquo; earn our bit of pay;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Murray in a mad black rage, goes on to rave an&rsquo;  shout.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sacked,&rdquo; the old man tells him plain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had  enough. Get Out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For close on half a minute I expected Hell to pay;<br>
    But Murray glares around the mill&mdash;then turns an&rsquo; walks away.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stops beside the loaded truck; an&rsquo; each man in the  mill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched Murray with a sidelong look; an&rsquo; each man  wished him ill.</p>
  <p>I knew Ben Murray for a gab; I knew him for a fool&mdash;<br>
    A decent man enough at heart when he was calm an&rsquo; cool&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild rage had hold on him that day, an&rsquo;, maybe, madness  too;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; scorn in me changed to dismay at what I saw him do.</p>
  <p>He sprang behind the timber load an&rsquo; leaped up to the back;<br>
    He loosed the rope to start the truck upon the down-hill track;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; if he meant to jump or stay no man will ever know.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If I go out,&rdquo; Ben Murray yelled, &ldquo;this is the way I  go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop that mad fool!&rdquo; howled old man Blair. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll wreck the track  below!&rdquo;<br>
    But now the truck had gathered way, an&rsquo;, as we watched her go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Murray, with the brake-rope slack, cursed us with  all his might.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the curve behind the huts, an&rsquo; then went out  of sight.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b> </p>
  <p>We found him near the wattle-clump, down in the little creek.<br>
    His head was by a coral fern, an&rsquo; blood was on his cheek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; blood was on the wooden rails, an&rsquo; he lay very  still,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who half an hour ago had meant to boss the  mill!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; yet&rdquo; says old man Blair. &ldquo;Boys, we must do our best.<br>
    Lay hold there, Jim, an&rsquo; you, young Dick, an&rsquo; heave that off his chest.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, but he&rsquo;s crushed! The crazy fool! Now treat him  gently, lad.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The track ain&rsquo;t damaged much,&rdquo; says Pike; &ldquo;but,  gosh,&nbsp;<i>he&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;got it bad!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b> </p>
  <p>Red stains were on the wooden track an&rsquo; on the sunlight ground;<br>
    A wagtail twittered by the creek, an&rsquo; hopped an&rsquo; fussed around;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Laughin&rsquo; Jacks were wild with mirth; but very still  he lay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we took poor Ben Murray up an&rsquo; carried him away.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheReaperintheBush"></a>The Reaper in the Bush</b></h2>
  <p>He&nbsp;was lyin&rsquo; on his bunk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hut behind the mill,<br>
    Ravin&rsquo; like a man wild drunk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never silent, never still,<br>
  &ldquo;Best go in an&rsquo; say Good bye,&rdquo;<br>
    Says old Blair. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>God! I never want to see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any face so wrung with pain,<br>
    Nor to hear such blasphemy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever in my life again.<br>
    White he was, an&rsquo; starey-eyed,<br>
    With his hand pressed to his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now he raves,&rdquo; says Daddy Pike.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t wise to what he says<br>
    Never have I heard the like<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All me wicked livin&rsquo; days.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Raise him up a bit,&rdquo; says Blair.<br>
  &ldquo;Put that pillow under there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Raise him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; There now, easy, lad.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn a little&mdash;gently&mdash;so.<br>
    You&rsquo;ll not feel it near so bad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painin&rsquo;? Yes, I know, I know.<br>
    Yes, old man; it&rsquo;s Blair, your friend.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    (Boys, he&rsquo;s very near the end.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>Soon a saner, calmer look<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came in Murray&rsquo;s  strainin&rsquo; eyes.<br>
    Though his body heaved an&rsquo; shook,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held back his awful cries<br>
    Till another wave of pain<br>
    Gripped him, an&rsquo; he shrieked again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Christ!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;O, Christ, the pain!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys, you know I ain&rsquo;t a funk.&rdquo;<br>
    Still he took the Name in vain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writhin&rsquo; there upon his bunk.<br>
  &ldquo;Do you call him?&rdquo; says old Blair.<br>
    Pointin&rsquo; upward. &ldquo;He is there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blair!&rdquo; he gasps. &ldquo;Do you believe?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as me! Is there a chance?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Easy, Murray.  Don&rsquo;t you grieve.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ain&rsquo;t worth a single glance<br>
    Save of pity from His eye.<br>
    Laddie, pray before you die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God! I&rsquo;m frightened, Blair!&rdquo; says he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Boys, you know I never  whined.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    Where&rsquo;s the hope for one like me?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain&rsquo;t no hymn-singin&rsquo; kind.&rdquo;<br>
    There was pleadin&rsquo; in his glance:<br>
  &ldquo;Blair,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is there a chance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Bob Blair reached for his hand.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Chance there is, an&rsquo; certainty.<br>
    Try to think an&rsquo; understand.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothin&rsquo;s There to fear,&rdquo; says he.<br>
  &ldquo;Him, the Merciful, the Mild,<br>
    Think ye He would strike a child?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think ye that he put you here,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave you labour, gave you pain,<br>
    So your end should be fear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you plead to Him in vain?<br>
    Nay, dear laddie, while you&rsquo;ve breath,<br>
    Live in hope, an&rsquo; smile on death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a hard hand, woman-kind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed back the sweaty hair.<br>
  &ldquo;Now then, laddie, ease your mind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain will end for you out  There.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;<br>
    An&rsquo; the smile on Blair&rsquo;s rough face<br>
    Was a blessin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; says Ben, &ldquo;You are a friend:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend, old man, an&rsquo; father too.<br>
    Hold my hand right to the end&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ll take notice There of&nbsp;<i>you</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    Good-bye, Jim, an&rsquo; Dusty Dick,<br>
    Simon, Pike.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;&mdash;quick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With his eyes shut tight he lay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His breath comin&rsquo; in great sobs.<br>
    An&rsquo; his poor lips seemed to pray,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his hand held fast to  Bob&rsquo;s.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    Now his sobs an&rsquo; prayin&rsquo; cease.<br>
    Says old Blair, &ldquo;God give him peace!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give him peace!&rdquo; sighed old Bob Blair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he rose beside the dead.<br>
    But I caught his wistful stare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; the muttered words he said:<br>
  &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he prayed&mdash;&ldquo;if one there be&mdash;<br>
    Give such faith an&rsquo; peace to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Flames"></a>Flames</b></h2>
  <p>It&rsquo;s&nbsp;human nature for a bashful bloke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bottle up, an&rsquo; hesitate, an&rsquo; doubt<br>
    Till grinnin&rsquo; Fate plays him some low-down joke;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in excitement, he goes blurtin&rsquo; out<br>
    The tale his sane mind never would impart,<br>
    So all the near-by world knows it by heart.</p>
  <p>Good luck for me, the near-by world that day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I ran sobbin&rsquo; thro&rsquo; the scorchin&rsquo; fern,<br>
    Held few to hear the foolish things I say;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one was there my secret thought to learn,<br>
    As I went shoutin&rsquo; down the mountain spur,<br>
    Only the scared birds, an&rsquo; the trees, an&rsquo; Her.</p>
  <p>In fancy, many men have been thro&rsquo; Hell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tortured by fear, when hope has almost died;<br>
    But few have gone thro&rsquo; that, an&rsquo; fire as well<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come on Heaven on the other side<br>
    With just one angel in it, safe an&rsquo; well&mdash;<br>
    A cool, calm angel by the name of Nell.</p>
  <p>The day the fire came sweepin&rsquo; down the hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lickin&rsquo; the forest up like some mad beast,<br>
    We had our work cut out to save the mill;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo;, when the wind swung round into the East,<br>
    An&rsquo; blew the roarin&rsquo; flames along the spur,<br>
    Straight for &ldquo;The Height,&rdquo; I gets quick fear for Her.</p>
  <p>Flat out I was fightin&rsquo; all day long&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(We saved the mill-shed, but the huts were done)&mdash;<br>
    When some bloke, weak with sprintin&rsquo; comes along&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Comic, it seemed, to me the way he run)&mdash;<br>
    Shoutin&rsquo; that someone&rsquo;s missin&rsquo; from &ldquo;The Height,&rdquo;<br>
    An&rsquo; all the forest at the back&rsquo;s alight.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t what he thought, an&rsquo; never cared,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I grabs at his coat an&rsquo; starts to yell.<br>
    I only know that I was dreadful scared.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half a minute more, I guessed &rsquo;twas Nell.<br>
    He tell me when an&rsquo; where they thought she went,<br>
    An&rsquo; of the useless searchers they had sent.</p>
  <p>I never waits for more; but turned an&rsquo; ran<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight for the spur, along the scorchin&rsquo; track.<br>
    Behind me, as I went, I hear some man&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s Pike&mdash;bawlin&rsquo;, &ldquo;You fool! Come back!&rdquo;<br>
    What plan was in my mind I cannot tell;<br>
    I only know I want to find my Nell.</p>
  <p>Next thing I mind, I&rsquo;ve left the track, an&rsquo; turned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the blackened scrub&mdash;my eyes feel bad&mdash;<br>
    Above my head the messmate trees still burned.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; Lord, them awful fancies that I had!<br>
    I seen her lyin&rsquo; there&mdash;her face&mdash;her hair.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    Why, even now, them thoughts give me a scare.</p>
  <p>I stumble on. Against a red-hot butt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I burn my hand, but never even swear;<br>
    But keep on sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Make the splitter&rsquo;s hut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splitter&rsquo;s hut! Get to the clearin&rsquo; there.<br>
    She&rsquo;s at the splitter&rsquo;s hut; an&rsquo; if she ain&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;<br>
    My heart turns over, an&rsquo; I feel dead faint.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; as I plug along, I hear some fool<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeatin&rsquo; words till they sound like a spell.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; mad,&rdquo; I thinks. &ldquo;Keep cool! Keep cool!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still the voice goes on&rdquo; &ldquo;My Nell! My Nell!&rdquo;<br>
    I whips round quick to see who he can be,<br>
    This yappin&rsquo; fool&mdash;then realize it&rsquo;s me.</p>
  <p>They say I must have gone thro&rsquo; blazin&rsquo; ferns.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I did; but I don&rsquo;t recollect.<br>
    My mind was blank, but, judgin&rsquo; by my burns,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s something got to me that took effect.<br>
    But once, I know, I saw a flamin&rsquo; tree<br>
    Fall just behind me; but that don&rsquo;t trouble me.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know how I reached the splitter&rsquo;s hut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only saw the ragin&rsquo; fire&mdash;an&rsquo; Nell.<br>
    My clothes were torn, my face an&rsquo; hands were cut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; half a dozen times, at least, I fell.<br>
    I burst into the clearin&rsquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an&rsquo; I  look.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    She&rsquo;s sittin&rsquo; on a log there&mdash;<i>with a book!</i></p>
  <p>I seem to cross that clearin&rsquo; in a stride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still sobbin&rsquo; like a kid: &ldquo;My Nell! My nell!&rdquo;<br>
    I was clean mad. But, as I reach her side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sort of wake, an&rsquo; give that song a spell.<br>
    But, by her eyes, for all she seemed so cool,<br>
    I know she must have heard, an&rsquo; feel a fool.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mister Jim? You do look hot,&rdquo; says she.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(But still her eyes says oceans more than that).<br>
  &ldquo;Did you come all the way up here for me?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coolness? I tell you straight, it knocked me flat.<br>
    By rights, she should fall sobbin&rsquo; in my arms;<br>
    But no; there weren&rsquo;t no shrieks an&rsquo; no alarms.</p>
  <p>I pulls myself together with a jerk.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, just a stroll,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.<br>
    The mill&rsquo;s half burnt, an&rsquo; I am out of work;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They missed you so I looked around a bit.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Now, that&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;good of you,&rdquo; says she, reel bright.<br>
  &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the bush-fire such a splendid sight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looks me up and down. &ldquo;Why, Mister Jim,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She says to me, &ldquo;you do look hot, indeed.<br>
    If you go strollin&rsquo; that way for a whim<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever would you do in case of need?&rdquo;<br>
    That&rsquo;s what she said. But with her eyes she sent<br>
    More than her thanks; an&rsquo; I was quite content.</p>
  <p>I seen her home; or, rather, she seen me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I was weak, an&rsquo; fumbled in my stride.<br>
    But, when we reached &ldquo;The Height,&rdquo; I seen that she<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was just on breakin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; she went  inside.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
    I stumbles home. &ldquo;Well, Jim, lad, anyway,&rdquo;<br>
    I tells myself, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had a fine, full day.&rdquo;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does me nicely for a start; but what do I say  next?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the Jacks take up the song, an&rsquo; I get very  vexed.</p>

    I&rsquo;d put a clean white collar on, I&rsquo;d picked a bunch of heath;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I was cleaned an&rsquo; clobbered up to meet my Nell that  day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now my awful trouble comes: What is a man to say?</p>
  <p>I mean to tell her all I&rsquo;ve thought since first I saw her there,<br>
    On the bark-heap by the mill-shed, with the sunlight in her hair.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean to tell her all I&rsquo;ve done an&rsquo; what I&rsquo;ll do with  life;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo;, when I&rsquo;ve said all that an&rsquo; more, I&rsquo;ll ask her for  my wife.</p>
  <p>I mean to tell her she&rsquo;s too good, by far, for such as me,<br>
    An&rsquo; how with lonely forest life she never may agree.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean to tell her lots of things, an&rsquo; be reel straight  an&rsquo; fine;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after she&rsquo;s considered that, I&rsquo;ll ask her to be  mine.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ve got much hope&mdash;a simple country yob.<br>
    I&rsquo;d like to have a word with Blair&mdash;He&rsquo;s wise, is good old Bob.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s got such common sense an&rsquo; that, he&rsquo;d tip me what  to say.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&rsquo;m not nervous, not a bit; I&rsquo;ll do it my own  way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I seen her by the sassafras, the sun was on her hair;<br>
    An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know what come to me to see her standin&rsquo; there.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never even lifts my hat, I never says &ldquo;Good day&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her that should be treated in a reel respectful way.</p>
  <p>I only know the girl I want is standin&rsquo; smilin&rsquo; there<br>
    Right underneath the sassafras. I never thought I&rsquo;d dare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I holds out my arms to her, an&rsquo; says, as I come  near&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one word of that speech of mine&mdash;but, &ldquo;Oh, you  pretty dear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was enough. Lord save a man! It&rsquo;s simple if he knew,<br>
    There&rsquo;s one way with a woman if she loves you good an&rsquo; true.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next moment she is in my arms; an&rsquo; me? I don&rsquo;t know  where.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Heaven can compare with it I won&rsquo;t fret much up  there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mister Jim,&rdquo; she says to me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very bold,&rdquo; says she.<br>
  &ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; I says. Then she looks up&mdash;an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the end of  me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O man!&rdquo; she cries. &ldquo;O modest man, if you go on like  this&mdash;&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I interrupt a lady, an&rsquo; I do it with a kiss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim, do you know what heroes are?&rdquo; says she, when I&rsquo;d &ldquo;behaved.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re blokes that save  fair maids that won&rsquo;t be saved.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine,&rdquo; says she, an&rsquo; smiles at me, &ldquo;an&rsquo; will be  all my life&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, if it occurs to you to ask me for your wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Grey thrush is in the wattle tree when I get home that day<br>
    Back to my silent, lonely house&mdash;an&rsquo; still he sings away.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other voice about, no step upon the floor;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; none to come an&rsquo; welcome me as I get to the door.</p>
  <p>Yet in the happy heart of me I play at make-believe:<br>
    I hear one singin&rsquo; in the room where once I used to grieve;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear a light step on the path, an&rsquo;, as I reach the  gate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A happy voice, that makes me glad, tells me I&rsquo;m awful  late.</p>
  <p>Now what&rsquo;s a man to think of that, an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s a man to say,<br>
    Who&rsquo;s been out workin&rsquo; in the bush, tree-fallin&rsquo;, all the day?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; how&rsquo;s a man to greet his wife, if she should meet  him here?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Grey Thrush in the wattle tree says, &ldquo;Oh, you  pretty dear!</p>
