<h1>A New and Comprehensive Vocabulary of the Flash Language</h1>

<p class="author">compiled and written by<br>
<br>
James Hardy Vaux</p>

<hr>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p><i>The Author has found it necessary to introduce frequently, in
the course if his definitions, technical, or cant words and
Phrases. This he could not avoid without much tautology and
unpleasing circumlocution. The Reader will therefore take notice,
that all such cant terms are placed in Italics; and where at a loss
to comprehend them, he has only to refer to their alphabetical
position for an explanation.</i>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>ORIGINAL DEDICATION.</h2>

<p><i>To THOMAS SKOTTOWE, Esq., of His Majesty's 73d Regiment,
Commandant of Newcastle, in the Colony of New South Wales, and one
of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for that Territory.</i>
</p>

<p>SIR,</p>

<p>WITH the utmost deference and respect, I beg leave to submit to
your perusal the following sheets. The idea of such a compilation
first originated in the suggestion of a friend; and however the
theme may be condemned as exceptionable by narrow minds, I feel
confident you possess too much liberality of sentiment to reject
its writer as utterly depraved, because he has acquired an
extensive knowledge on a subject so obviously disgraceful. True it
is, that in the course of a chequered and eventful life, I have
intermixed with the most dissolute and unprincipled characters, and
that a natural quickness of conception, and most retentive memory,
have rendered me familiar with their language and system of
operations.</p>

<p>Permit me, Sir, to assure you most seriously, that I view with
remorse the retrospect of my hitherto misspent life, and that my
future exertions shall be solely directed to acquire the estimable
good opinion of the virtuous part of the community.</p>

<p>I trust the Vocabulary will afford you some amusement from its
novelty; and that from the correctness of its definitions, you may
occasionally find it useful in your magisterial capacity.</p>

<p>I cannot omit this opportunity of expressing my gratitude for
the very humane and equitable treatment I have experienced in
common with every other person in this settlement*, under your
temperate and judicious government.</p>

<p>I have the honour to remain,<br>
with the most dutiful respect,<br>
Sir,<br>
Your devoted, and very humble Servant,<br>
<br>
J. H. VAUX.<br>
Newcastle,<br>
5th July, 1812</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The Author (a prisoner under sentence of
transportation for life) having, by an alleged act of impropriety,
incurred the Governor's displeasure, was at this period banished to
Newcastle, a place of punishment for offenders: these sheets were
there compiled during his solitary hours of cessation from hard
labour; and the Commandant was accordingly presented by the Author
with the first copy of his production.]</p>

<h3>A VOCABULARY OF THE FLASH LANGUAGE</h3>

<hr>

down the areas of private houses, and robbing the lower apartments
of plate or other articles.</p>

<p>ARM-PITS: To <i>work</i> under <i>the arm-pits</i>, is to
practise only such kinds of depredation, as will amount, upon
conviction, to what the law terms single, or petty larceny; the
extent of punishment for which is transportation for seven years.
By following this system, a thief avoids the halter, which
certainly is applied <i>above</i> the arm-pits.</p>

<p>AWAKE: an expression used on many occasions; as a thief will say
to his accomplice, on perceiving the person they are about to rob
is aware of their intention, and upon his guard, <i>stow it</i>,
the <i>cove's awake</i>. To be awake to any scheme, deception, or
design, means, generally, to see through or comprehend it.</p>

<h3>B</h3>

<p>BACK-JUMP. A back-window. <i>See</i> JUMP.</p>

<p>BACK-SLANG: to enter or come out of a house by the back-door ;
or, to go a circuitous or private way through the streets, in order
to avoid any particular place in the direct road, is termed
<i>back-slanging it</i>.</p>

<p>BACK-SLUM: a back room; also the back entrance to any house or
premises; thus, we'll <i>give it 'em on the back-slum</i>, means,
we'll get in at the back-door.</p>

<p>BAD HALFPENNY. When a man has been upon any errand, or
attempting any object which has proved unsuccessful or
impracticable, he will say on his return, It's a <i>bad
halfpenny</i>; meaning he has returned as he went.</p>

<p>BANDED: hungry.</p>

<p>BANDS. To <i>wear the bands</i>, is to be hungry, or short of
food for any length of time; a phrase chiefly used on board the
hulks, or in jails.</p>

<p>BANG- UP. A person, whose dress or equipage is in the first
style of perfection, is declared to be <i>bang up to the mark</i>.
A man who has behaved with extraordinary spirit and resolution in
any enterprise he has been engaged in, is also said to have <i>come
bang up to the mark</i>; any article which is remarkably good or
elegant, or any fashion, act, or measure which is carried to the

phrase.</p>

cant name for the House of Correction, Cold-Bath-Fields,
London.</p>

memory, was known among <i>family</i> people by the title of the
blind <i>beak</i>.</p>

cry after him, in order to get him stopped.</p>

<p>BELLOWSER. <i>See</i> WIND.</p>

<p>BENDER: a sixpence.</p>

<p>BENDER: an ironical word used in conversation by <i>flash</i>
people; as where one party affirms or professes any thing which the
other believes to be false or insincere, the latter expresses his
incredulity by exclaiming <i>bender!</i> or, if one asks another to
do any act which the latter considers unreasonable or
impracticable, he replies, O yes, I'll do it&mdash;<i>bender</i>;
meaning, by the addition of the last word, that, in fact, he will
do no such thing.</p>

<p>BEST: to <i>get your money at the best</i>, signifies to live by
dishonest or fraudulent practices, without labour or industry,
according to the general acceptation of the latter word; but,
certainly, no persons have more occasion to be industrious, and in
a state of perpetual action than <i>cross-coves</i>; and experience
has proved, when too late, to many of them, that honesty is the
best policy; and, consequently, that the above phrase is by no
means <i>à-propos</i>.</p>

<p>BETTY: picklock; to <i>unbetty</i>, or <i>betty</i> a lock, is
to open or relock it, by means of the <i>betty</i>, so as to avoid
subsequent detection.</p>

<p>BLOWEN: a prostitute; a woman who cohabits with a man without
marriage.</p>

churches, or other buildings, very prevalent in London and its
vicinity.</p>

<p>BLUNT: money.</p>

sold to the surgeons and students in anatomy.</p>

<i>bolting</i>, or <i>making a bolt</i>: a thief observing an alarm
while attempting a robbery, will exclaim to his accomplice,
<i>Bolt</i>, there's <i>a down</i>. sudden escape of one or more
prisoners from a place of confinement is termed a <i>bolt</i>.</p>

<p>BOLT-IN-TUN: a term founded on the cant word <i>bolt</i>, and
merely a fanciful variation, very common among <i>flash</i>
persons, there being in London a famous inn so called; it is
customary when a man has run away from his lodgings, broke out of a
jail, or made any other sudden movement, to say, The
<i>Bolt-in-tun</i> is concerned; or, He's gone to the
<i>Bolt-in-tun</i>; instead of simply saying, He has <i>bolted</i>,
<i>etc</i>. See BOLT.</p>

<p>BONED: taken in custody, apprehended; Tell us how you was
<i>boned</i>, signifies, tell us the story of your apprehension; a
common request among fellow-prisoners in a jail, etc., which is
readily complied with in general; and the various circumstances
therein related afford present amusement, and also useful hints for
regulating their future operations, so as to avoid the like
misfortune.</p>

<p>BONNET: a concealment, pretext, or pretence; an ostensible
manner of accounting for what you really mean to conceal; as a man
who actually lives by depredation, will still outwardly follow some
honest employment, as a clerk, porter, newsman, etc. By this system
of policy, he is said to have a good <i>bonnet</i> if he happens to
get <i>boned</i>, and, in a doubtful case, is commonly discharged
on the score of having a good character. To <i>bonnet for</i> a
person, is to corroborate any assertion he has made, or to relate
facts in the most favourable light, in order to extricate him from
a dilemma, or to further any object he has in view.</p>

<p>BOUNCE: to bully, threaten, talk loud, or affect great
consequence; to <i>bounce</i> a person out of any thing, is to use
threatening or high words, in order to intimidate him, and attain
the object you are intent upon; or to obtain goods of a tradesman,
by assuming the appearance of great respectability and importance,
so as to remove any suspicion he might at first entertain. A thief,
detected in the commission of a robbery, has been known by this
sort of finesse, aided by a genteel appearance and polite manners,
to persuade his accusers of his innocence, and not only to get off
with a good grace, but induce them to apologize for their supposed
mistake, and the affront put upon him. This masterstroke of
effrontery is called <i>giving it to 'em upon the bounce</i>.</p>

<p>BOUNCE: a person well or fashionably drest, is said to be a
<i>rank bounce</i>.</p>

<p>BOWLED OUT: a man who has followed the profession of thieving
for some time, when he is ultimately taken, tried, and convicted,
is said to be <i>bowled out at last</i>. To <i>bowl</i> a person
<i>out</i>, in a general sense, means to detect him in the
commission of any fraud, or peculation, which he has hitherto
practised without discovery.</p>

<p>BRACE UP: to dispose of stolen goods by pledging them for the
utmost you can get at a pawnbroker's, is termed <i>bracing</i> them
<i>up</i>.</p>

<p>BRADS: halfpence; also, money in general.</p>

<p>BREAKING UP OF THE SPELL: the nightly termination of performance
at the Theatres Royal, which is regularly attended by pickpockets
of the lower order, who exercise their vocation about the doors and
avenues leading thereto, until the house is emptied and the crowd
dispersed.</p>

<p>BREECH'D: flush of money.</p>

<p>BRIDGE: to <i>bridge</i> a person, or <i>throw</i> him <i>over
the bridge</i>, is, in a general sense, to deceive him by betraying
the confidence he has reposed in you, and instead of serving him
faithfully, to involve him in ruin or disgrace; or, three men being
concerned alike in any transaction, two of them will form a
collusion to <i>bridge</i> the third, and engross to themselves all
the advantage which may eventually accrue. Two persons having been
engaged in a long and doubtful contest or rivalship, he, who by
superior art or perseverance gains the point, is said to have
<i>thrown</i> his opponent <i>over the bridge</i>. Among gamblers,
it means deceiving the person who had back'd you, by wilfully
losing the game; the money so lost by him being shared between
yourself and your confederates who had laid against you. In playing
three-handed games, two of the party will play into each other's
hands, so that the third must inevitably be <i>thrown over the
bridge</i>, commonly called, <i>two poll one</i>. <i>See</i> PLAY
ACROSS.</p>

<p>BROADS: cards ; a person expert at which is said to be a good
<i>broad-player</i>.</p>

<p>BROWNS and WHISTLERS: bad halfpence and farthings; (a term used
by coiners.)</p>

<p>BUB: a low expression signifying drink.</p>

<p>BUCKET. To <i>bucket</i> a person is synonymous with
<i>putting</i> him <i>in the well</i>. <i>See</i> WELL. Such
treatment is said to be a <i>bucketting concern</i>.</p>

<p>BUFF, To <i>buff to</i> a person or thing, is to swear to the
identity of them; swearing very positively to any circumstance, is
called <i>buffing it home</i>.</p>

<p>BUFFER: a dog.</p>

<p>BUG or BUG OVER. To give, deliver, or hand over; as, He
<i>bug'd</i> me a <i>quid</i>, he gave me a guinea; <i>bug over the
rag</i>, hand over the money.</p>

<i>bull-hanking</i>; that is, bull-baiting, or bullock-hunting,

<p>BUM-CHARTER: a name given to bread steeped in hot water, by the

said to be <i>done upon the bustle</i>. To <i>give it to</i> a man
<i>upon the bustle</i>, is to obtain any point, as borrowing money,
etc.; by some sudden story or pretence, and affecting great haste,
so that he is taken by surprise, and becomes duped before he has
time to consider of the matter.</p>

<p>BUZ: to <i>buz</i> a person is to pick his pocket. <i>The

<p>CHANT: a person's name, address, or designation; thus, a thief

him for any service done, or a <i>blowen</i> requiring her previous
compliment from a <i>family-man</i>, would say, <i>Come, tip us the dues</i>. So

likely to go to jail, one will say, there will be <i>quodding dues

<p>FAKEMAN-CHARLEY; FAKEMENT. As <i>to fake</i> signifies to do any act,
or make any thing, so <i>the fakement</i> means the act or thing alluded
to, and on which your discourse turns; consequently, any stranger
unacquainted with your subject will not comprehend what is meant by
<i>the fakement</i>; for instance, having recently been concerned with
another in some robbery, and immediately separated, the latter
taking the booty with him, on your next meeting you will inquire,
what he has done with the <i>fakement?</i> meaning the article stolen,
whether it was a pocket-book, piece or linen, or what not. Speaking
of any stolen property which has a private mark, one will say,
there is a <i>fakeman-charley</i> on it; a forgery which is well executed,
is said to be a <i>prime fakement</i>; in a word, any thing is liable to
be termed a <i>fakement</i>, or a <i>fakeman-charley</i>, provided the person you
address knows to what you allude.</p>

imprudence on your part, subjects you to the charge of having
spoiled him. Speaking of some particular species of fraud or
robbery, which after a long series of success, is now become stale
or impracticable from the public being guarded against it, the
family will say, that game is spoiled at last. So having attempted
the robbery of any particular house or shop, and by miscarrying
caused such an alarm as to render a second attempt dangerous or
impolitic, they will say, that place is spoil'd, it is useless to
try it on any more.</p>

<p>SPOKE TO: alluding to any person or place that has been already
robbed, they say, that place, or person, has been spoke to before.
A family man on discovering that he has been robbed, will exclaim,
I have been spoke to, and perhaps will add, for such a thing,
naming what he has lost. Spoke to upon the screw, crack, sneak,
hoist, buz, etc. etc., means robbed upon either of those particular
suits or games. Upon any great misfortune befalling a man, as being

concern. A tradesman or other person who is considered by the world
to be an honest man, and who is unacquainted with family people,
and their system of operations, is by the latter emphatically
styled a square cove, whereas an old thief who has acquired an
independence, and now confines himself to square practices, is
still called by his old pals a flash cove, who has tied up
prigging. See GROSS and FLAT. In making a bargain or contract, any
overture considered to be really fair and reasonable, is declared
to be a square thing, or to be upon the square. To be upon the

play, is called a stake, and if considerable, a prime stake, or a
heavy stake. A person alluding to any thing difficult to be
procured, or which he obtains as a great favour, and is therefore
comparatively invaluable, would say, I consider it a stake to get
it at all; a valuable or acceptable acquisition of any kind, is
emphatically called a stake, meaning a great prize.</p>

<p>STALL: a violent pressure in a crowd, made by pick-pockets for
the more easily effecting their depredatory purposes; this is
called making a rum stall in the push.</p>

<p>STALL OFF: a term variously applied; generally it means a
pretence, excuse, or prevarication-as a person charged 'with any
fault, entering into some plausible story, to excuse himself, his
hearers or accusers would say, O yes, that's a good stall off, or,
Aye, aye, stall it off that way if you can. To extricate a person
from any dilemma, or save him from disgrace, is called stalling him
off; as an accomplice of your's being detected in a robbery, etc.,
and about to be given up to justice, you will step up as a
stranger, interfere in his behalf, and either by vouching for his
innocence, recommending lenity, or some other artifice, persuade
his accusers to forego their intention, and let the prisoner
escape; you will then boast of having stalled him off in prime
twig. To avoid or escape any impending evil or punishment by means
of artifice, submission, bribe, or otherwise, is also called
stalling it off. A man walking the streets, and passing a
particular shop, or encountering a certain person, which or whom he
has reasons for wishing to avoid, will say to any friend who may be
with him, I wish you'd stall me off from that crib, (or from that
cove, as the case may be) meaning, walk in such a way as to cover
or obscure me from notice, until we are past the shop or person in
question.</p>

<p>STALL UP: To stall a person up, (a term used by pickpockets,) is
to surround him in a crowd, or violent pressure, and even sometimes
in the open street, while walking along, and by violence force his
arms up, and keep them in that position while others of the gang
rifle his pockets at pleasure, the cove being unable to help or
defend himself; this is what the newspapers denominate hustling,
and is universally practised at the doors of public theatres, at
boxing matches, ship-launches, and other places where the general
anxiety of all ranks, either to push forward, or to obtain a view
of the scene before them, forms a pretext for jostling, and every
other advantage which the strength or numbers of one party gives
them over a weaker one, or a single person. It is not unusual for
the buz-coves, on particular occasions, to procure a formidable
squad of stout fellows of the lower class, who, though not expert
at knuckling, render essential service by violently pushing and
squeezing in the crowd, and, in the confusion excited by this
conduct, the unconcerned prigs reap a plentiful harvest, and the
stallers up are gratified with such part of the gains acquired, as
the liberality of the knuckling gentlemen may prompt them to
bestow. This coup de guerre is termed making a regular stall at
such a place, naming the scene of their operations. See STALL.</p>

<p>STAMPS: shoes.</p>

<p>STAND THE PATTER. See PATTER'D.</p>

<p>STAR. The star is a game chiefly practised by young boys, often
under ten years of age, although the offence is capital. It
consists of cutting a pane of glass in a shop-window, by a peculiar
operation I called starring the glaze, which is performed very
effectually by a common penknife; the depredators then take out
such articles of value as lie within reach of their arm, which if
they are not interrupted, sometimes includes half the contents of
the window. A person convicted of this offence is said to have been
done for a star.</p>

<p>START. See PITCHER.</p>

<p>STASH. To stash any practice, habit, or proceeding, signifies to
put an end to, relinquish, or quash the same; thus, a thief
determined to leave off his vicious courses will declare that he
means to stash (or stow) prigging. A man in custody for felony,
will endeavour, by offering money, or other means, to induce his
prosecutor's forbearance, and compromise the matter, so as to
obtain his liberation; this is called stashing the business. To
stash drinking, card-playing, or any other employment you may be
engaged in, for the time present, signifies to stow it, knife it,
cheese it, or cut it, which are all synonymous, that is, to desist
or leave off. See WANTED.</p>

another in a mixed company to be silent, or drop the subject, he
was upon. See MANG.</p>

auditor believes to be false, or spoken in jest, or wishes the
former to recant, the latter will say, stow that, if you please,
or, cheese that, meaning don't say so, or that's out of the
question.</p>

<p>STRETCH. Five or ten stretch, signifies five or ten yards, etc.;
so in dealing for any article, as linen, etc., I will give you

pretence, etc., did you defraud them? One species of imposition is
said to be a prime suit, another a queer suit: a man describing the
pretext he used to obtain money from another, would say, I draw'd
him if a quid upon the suit if so and so, naming the ground of his
application. See DRAW. A person having engaged with another on very
advantageous terms to serve or work for him, will declare that he
is upon a good suit. To use great submission and respect in asking
any favour of another, is called giving it to him upon the humble
suit.</p>

<p>SWAG: a bundle, parcel, or package; as a swag of snow, etc. The
swag, is a term used in speaking of any booty you have lately
obtained, be it of what kind it may, except money, as Where did you
lumber the swag? that is, where did you deposit the stolen
property? To carry the swag is to be the bearer of the stolen goods
to a place of safety. A swag of any thing, signifies emphatically a
great deal. To have knap'd a good swag, is to have got a good
booty.</p>

comprehended under the name of swag, when describing any speak

jewellery, or other more portable articles.</p>

termed a swell, or a rank swell. A family man who appears to have
plenty of money, and makes a genteel figure, is said by his
associates to be in swell street. Any thing remarkable for its
beauty or elegance, is called a swell article; so a swell crib, is
a genteel house; a swell mollisher, an elegantly-dressed woman,
etc. Sometimes, in alluding to a particular gentleman, whose name
is not requisite, he is styled, the swell, meaning the person who
is the object of your discourse, or attention; and whether he is
called the swell, the cove, or the gory, is immaterial, as in the
following (in addition to many other) examples: I was turned up at
China-street, because the swell would not appear; meaning, of
course, the prosecutor: again, speaking of a person whom you were
on the point of robbing, but who has taken the alarm, and is
therefore on his guard, you will say to your pal, It's of no use,
the cove is as down as a hammer; or, We may as well stow it, the
gory's leary. See COVE and DOWN.</p>

<p>WEED: to pilfer or purloin a small portion from a large quantity
of any thing; often done by young or timid depredators, in the hope
of escaping detection, as, an apprentice or shopman will weed his
master's lob, that is, take small sums out of the till when
opportunity offers, which sort of peculation may be carried on with
impunity for a length of time; but experienced thieves sometimes
think it good Judgment to weed a place, in order that it may be
good again, perhaps for a considerable length of time, as in the
instance of a warehouse or other depot for goods, to which they may
possess the means of access by means of a false key; in this ease,
by taking too great a swag, at first, the proprietors would
discover the deficiency, and take measures to prevent future
depredation. To weed the swag is to embezzle part of the booty,
unknown to your pals, before a division takes place, a temptation
against which very few of tm family are proof, if they can find an
opportunity. A flash-cove, on discovering a deficiency in his purse
or property, which he cannot account for, will declare that he, (or
it, naming the article,) has been weeded to the ruffian.</p>

flash as the thieves themselves. It is often customary with the

reward would attach, and to let a thief reign unmolested till he
commits a capital crime. They then grab him, and, on conviction,
share (in many cases) a reward of 40l., or upwards; therefore these
gentry will say, Let him alone at present, we don't want him till
he weighs his weight, meaning, of course, forty pounds.</p>

<p>WORK. To work upon any particular game, is to practise
generally, that species of fraud or depredation, as, He works upon
the crack, he follows housebreaking, etc. An offender having been

repetition of their former pleasures. See BONED. A person expert at
telling these stories, is said to spin a fine yarn. A man using a
great deal of rhetoric, and exerting all his art to talk another
person out of any thing he is intent upon, the latter will answer,
Aye, Aye, you can spin a good yarn, but it won't do; meaning, all
your eloquence will not have the desired effect.</p>

<p>YOKUFF: a chest, or large box.</p>
