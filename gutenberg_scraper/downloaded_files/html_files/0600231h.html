EVENTS AT ZINDERNEUF</a></h2>

<h3>TOLD BY MAJOR HENRI DE BEAUJOLAIS OF THE SPAHIS TO<br>
GEORGE LAWRENCE, ESQ., C.M.G., OF THE NIGERIAN CIVIL
SERVICE</h3>

<p class="quote">"<i>Tout ce que je raconte, je l'ai vu, et
si j'ai pu me tromper en le voyant, bien certainement je ne
vous trompe pas en vous le disant.</i>"</p>

<p class="cp">"The place was silent and <i>aware.</i>"</p>

<h3>§ 1</h3>

<p class="first">MR. GEORGE LAWRENCE, C.M.G., First Class
District Officer of His Majesty's Civil Service, sat at the
door of his tent and viewed the African desert scene with
the eye of extreme disfavour. There was beauty neither in
the landscape nor in the eye of the beholder.</p>

<p>The landscape consisted of sand, stone, <i>kerengia</i>
burr-grass, <i>tafasa</i> underbrush, yellow, long-stalked with
long thin bean-pods; the whole varied by clumps of the
coarse and hideous <i>tumpafia</i> plant.</p>

<p>The eye was jaundiced, thanks to the heat and foul dust
of Bornu, to malaria, dysentery, inferior food, poisonous
water, and rapid continuous marching in appalling heat.</p>

<p>Weak and ill in body, Lawrence was worried and anxious
in mind, the one reacting on the other.</p>

<p>In the first place, there was the old standing trouble
about the Shuwa Patrol; in the second, the truculent
Chiboks were waxing insolent again, and their young men
were regarding not the words of their elders concerning Sir
Garnet Wolseley, and what happened, long, long ago, after
the battle of Chibok Hill. Thirdly, the price of grain had
risen to six shillings a <i>saa,</i> and famine threatened;
fourthly, the Shehu and Shuwa sheiks were quarrelling
again; and, fifthly, there was a very bad smallpox ju-ju
abroad in the land (a secret society whose "secret" was
to offer His Majesty's liege subjects the choice between
being infected with smallpox, or paying heavy blackmail to
the society). Lastly, there was acrimonious correspondence
with the All-Wise Ones (of the Secretariat in "Aiki Square"
at Zungeru), who, as usual, knew better than the man on
the spot, and bade him do either the impossible or the
disastrous.</p>

<p>And across all the <i>Harmattan</i> was blowing hard, that
terrible wind that carries the Saharan dust a hundred miles
to sea, not so much as a sand-storm, but as a mist or fog
of dust as fine as flour, filling the eyes, the lungs, the
pores of the skin, the nose and throat; getting into the
locks of rifles, the works of watches and cameras, defiling
water, food and everything else; rendering life a burden
and a curse.</p>

<p>The fact, moreover, that thirty days' weary travel over
burning desert, across oceans of loose wind-blown sand and
prairies of burnt grass, through breast-high swamps, and
across unbridged boatless rivers, lay between him and Kano,
added nothing to his satisfaction. For, in spite of all,
satisfaction there was, inasmuch as Kano was rail-head,
and the beginning of the first stage of the journey Home.
That but another month lay between him and "leave out of
Africa," kept George Lawrence on his feet.</p>

<p>From that wonderful and romantic Red City, Kano, sister
of Timbuktu, the train would take him, after a three days'
dusty journey, to the rubbish-heap called Lagos, on the
Bight of Benin of the wicked West African Coast. There he
would embark on the good ship <i>Appam,</i> greet her commander,
Captain Harrison, and sink into a deck-chair with that
glorious sigh of relief, known in its perfection only to
those weary ones who turn their backs upon the Outposts and
set their faces towards Home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for George Lawrence&mdash;disappointment,
worry, frustration, anxiety, heat, sand-flies, mosquitoes,
dust, fatigue, fever, dysentery, malarial ulcers, and that
great depression which comes of monotony indescribable,
weariness unutterable, and loneliness' unspeakable.</p>

<p>And the greatest of these is loneliness.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">But, in due course, George Lawrence
reached Kano and the Nassarawa Gate in the East Wall,
which leads to the European segregation, there to wait
for a couple of days for the bi-weekly train to Lagos.
These days he whiled away in strolling about the wonderful
Haussa city, visiting the market-place, exploring its seven
square miles of streets of mud houses, with their ant-proof
<i>dôm</i>-palm beams; watching the ebb and flow of varied
black and brown humanity at the thirteen great gates in
its mighty earthen ramparts; politely returning the cheery
and respectful "<i>Sanu! Sanu!</i>" greetings of the Haussas
who passed this specimen of the great Bature race, the
wonderful white men.</p>

<p>Idly he compared the value of the caravans of salt or of
ground-nuts with that of the old slave-caravans which the
white man thinks he has recently suppressed; and casually
passed the time of day with Touareg camel-drivers, who
invited him to hire or buy their piebald, brindled, or
white camels, and, occasionally, a rare and valuable beast
of the tawny reddish buff variety, so prized for speed and
endurance....</p>

<p>On the platform of Kano Station (imagine a platform and
station at Kano, ancient, mysterious, gigantic, emporium
of Central Africa, with its great eleven-mile wall, and
its hundred thousand native inhabitants and its twenty
white men; Kano, eight hundred miles from the sea, near the
border of Northern Nigeria which marches with the French
<i>Territoire Militaire</i> of Silent Sahara; Kano, whence
start the caravan routes to Lake Tchad on the north-east,
and Timbuktu on the north-west)&mdash;on this incredible
platform, George Lawrence was stirred from his weary apathy
by a pleasant surprise in the form of his old friend, Major
Henri de Beaujolais of the Spahis, now some kind of special
staff-officer in the French Soudan.</p>

<p>With de Beaujolais, Lawrence had been at Ainger's House
at Eton; and the two occasionally met, as thus, on the
Northern Nigerian Railway; on the ships of Messrs. Elder,
Dempster; at Lord's; at Longchamps; at Auteuil; and, once
or twice, at the house of their mutual admired friend, Lady
Brandon, at Brandon Abbas in Devonshire.</p>

<p>For de Beaujolais, Lawrence had a great respect and
liking, as a French soldier of the finest type, keen
as mustard, hard as nails, a thorough sportsman, and a
gentleman according to the exacting English standard.
Frequently he paid him the remarkable English compliment,
"One would hardly take you for a Frenchman, Jolly, you
might almost be English," a bouquet which de Beaujolais
received with less concern by reason of the fact that his
mother had been a Devonshire Cary.</p>

<p>Although the Spahi officer was heavily bearded, arrayed
in what Lawrence considered hopelessly ill-fitting khaki,
and partially extinguished by a villainous high-domed white
helmet (and looked as truly French as his friend looked
truly English), he, however, did not throw himself with a
howl of joy upon the bosom of his <i>cher Georges,</i> fling
his arms about his neck, kiss him upon both cheeks, nor
address him as his little cabbage. Rather as his old bean,
in fact.</p>

<p>A strong hand-grip, "Well, George!" and, "Hallo! Jolly,
old son," sufficed; but de Beaujolais' charming smile and
Lawrence's beaming grin showed their mutual delight.</p>

<p>And when the two men were stretched opposite
to each other on the long couches of their roomy
compartment, and had exchanged plans for spending their
leave&mdash;yachting, golf, and the Moors, on the one hand;
and Paris boulevards, race-courses, and Monte Carlo, on the
other&mdash;Lawrence found that he need talk no more, for
his friend was bursting and bubbling over with a story,
an unfathomable intriguing mystery, which he must tell or
die.</p>

<p>As the train steamed on from Kano Station and its
marvellous medley of Arabs, Haussas, Yorubas, Kroos, Egbas,
Beri-Beris, Fulanis, and assorted Nigerians from <i>sarkin,
sheikh, shehu,</i> and <i>matlaki,</i> to peasant, camel-man,
agriculturist, herdsman, shopkeeper, clerk, soldier,
tin-mine worker, and nomad, with their women and <i>piccins,</i>
the Frenchman began his tale.</p>

<p>Through Zaria, Minna Junction, and Zungeru, across the
Jebba Bridge over the Niger, through Ilorin, Oshogbo,
and mighty Ibadan to vast Abeokuta, with brief intervals
during which Lawrence frankly snored, de Beaujolais told
his tale. But at Abeokuta, George Lawrence received the
surprise of his life and the tale suddenly became of the
most vital interest to him, and from there to Lagos he was
all ears.</p>

<p>And as the <i>Appam</i> steamed through the sparkling
Atlantic, the Frenchman still told his tale&mdash;threshed
at its mystery, dissected and discussed it, speculated upon
it, and returned to it at the end of every digression.
Nor ever could George Lawrence have enough&mdash;since it
indirectly concerned the woman whom he had always loved.</p>

<p>When the two parted in London, Lawrence took it up and
continued it himself, until he, in his turn, brought it
back to his friend and told him its beginning and end.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">And the story, which Major Henri de
Beaujolais found so intriguing, he told to George Lawrence
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell you, my dear George, that it is the most
extraordinary and inexplicable thing that ever happened.
I shall think of nothing else until I have solved the
mystery, and you must help me. You, with your trained
official mind, detached and calm; your <i>phlegme
Britannique.</i></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;you shall be my Sherlock Holmes, and I will be
your wonder-stricken little Watson. Figure me then as the
little Watson; address me as 'My dear Watson.'</p>

<p>Having heard my tale&mdash;and I warn you, you will hear
little else for the next two or three weeks&mdash;you must
unhesitatingly make a pronouncement. Something prompt and
precise, my dear friend, <i>hein?</i>"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied Lawrence. "But suppose you give me the
facts first?"</p>

<p>"It was like this, my dear Holmes.... As you are aware,
I am literally buried alive in my present job at Tokotu.
But yes, with a burial-alive such as you of the Nigerian
Civil Service have no faintest possible conception, in the
uttermost Back of Beyond. (You, with your Maiduguri Polo
Club! Pouf!) Yes, interred living, in the southernmost
outpost of the <i>Territoire Militaire</i> of the Sahara, a
spot compared with which the very loneliest and vilest
Algerian border-hole would seem like Sidi-bel-Abbès itself,
Sidi-bel-Abbès like Algiers, Algiers like Paris in Africa,
and Paris like God's Own Paradise in Heaven.</p>

<p>Seconded from my beloved regiment, far from a
boulevard, a café, a club, far, indeed, from everything
that makes life supportable to an intelligent man, am I
entombed..."</p>

<p>"I've had some," interrupted Lawrence unsympathetically.
"Get on with the Dark Mystery."</p>

<p>"I see the sun rise and set; I see the sky above, and
the desert below; I see my handful of <i>cafard</i>-stricken men
in my mud fort, black Senegalese, and white mule-mounted
infantry whom I train, poor devils; and what else do I see?
What else from year's end to year's end?..."</p>

<p>"I shall weep in a minute," murmured Lawrence. "What
about the Dark Mystery?"</p>

<p>"What do I see?" continued the Major, ignoring
the unworthy remark. "A vulture. A jackal. A lizard.
If I am lucky and God is good, a slave-caravan from
Lake Tchad. A band of veiled Touaregs led by a Targui
bandit-chief, thirsting for the blood of the hated white
<i>Roumi</i>&mdash;and I bless them even as I open fire or lead
the attack of my mule-cavalry-playing-at-Spahis..."</p>

<p>"The Dark Mystery must have been a perfect godsend,
my dear Jolly," smiled Lawrence, as he extracted his
cheroot-case and extended it to his eloquent friend, lying
facing him on the opposite couch-seat of the uncomfortable
carriage of the Nigerian Railway. "What <i>was</i> it?"</p>

<p>"A godsend, indeed," replied the Frenchman. "Sent of
God, surely to save my reason and my life. But I doubt
if the price were not a little high, even for that! The
deaths of so many brave men.... And one of those deaths a
dastardly cold-blooded murder! The vile assassination of
a gallant <i>sous-officier....</i> And by one of his own men.
In the very hour of glorious victory.... <i>One of his own
men</i>&mdash;I am certain of it. But why? <i>Why?</i> I ask myself
night and day. And now I ask you, my friend.... The motive,
I ask?... But you shall hear all&mdash;and instantly solve
the problem, my dear Holmes, eh!...</p>

<p>Have you heard of our little post of Zinderneuf (far,
far north of Zinder which is in the Aïr country), north of
your Nigeria? No? Well you hear of it now, and it is where
this incomprehensible tragedy took place.</p>

<p>Behold me then, one devilish hot morning, yawning in
my pyjamas over a <i>gamelle</i> of coffee, in my quarters,
while from the <i>caserne</i> of my <i>légionnaires</i> come the
cries of '<i>Au jus</i>,' '<i>Au jus</i>,' as one carries round the
jug of coffee from bed to bed, and arouses the sleepers
to another day in Hell. And then as I wearily light a
wretched cigarette of our beastly <i>caporal,</i> there comes
running my orderly, babbling I know not what of a dying
Arab <i>goum</i>&mdash;they are always dying of fatigue these
fellows, if they have hurried a few miles&mdash;on a dying
camel, who cries at the gate that he is from Zinderneuf,
and that there is siege and massacre, battle, murder,
and sudden death. All slain and expecting to be killed.
All dead and the buglers blowing the Regimental Call,
the rally, the charge; making the devil of a row, and so
forth....</p>

<p>'<i>And is it the dying camel that cries all this?</i>' I
ask, even as I leap into my belts and boots, and rush
to the door and shout, '<i>Aux armes! Aux armes!</i>' to my
splendid fellows and wish to God they were my Spahis. '<i>But
no, Monsieur le Majeur</i>' declares the orderly, '<i>it is the
dying goum, dying of fatigue on the dying camel.</i>'</p>

<p>'<i>Then bid him not die, on pain of death, till I have
questioned him,</i>'I reply as I load my revolver. '<i>And tell
the Sergeant-Major that an advance-party of the Foreign
Legion on camels marches en tenue de campagne d'Afrique
in nine minutes from when I shouted</i> "<i>Aux armes.</i>" <i>The
rest of them on mules.</i>' You know the sort of thing, my
friend. You have turned out your guard of Haussas of the
West African Frontier Force nearly as quickly and smartly
at times, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Oh, nearly, nearly, perhaps. <i>Toujours la politesse,</i>"
murmured Lawrence.</p>

<p>"As we rode out of the gate of my fort, I gathered from
the still-dying <i>goum,</i> on the still-dying camel, that a
couple of days before, a large force of Touaregs had been
sighted from the look-out platform of Zinderneuf fort.
Promptly the wise <i>sous-officier,</i> in charge and command
since the lamented death of Captain Renouf, had turned the
<i>goum</i> loose on his fast <i>mehari</i> camel, with strict orders
not to be caught by the Touaregs if they invested the fort,
but to clear out and trek with all speed for help&mdash;as
it appeared to be a case of too heavy odds. If the Touaregs
were only playful, and passed the fort by, after a little
sporting pot-shotting, he was to follow them, I suppose,
see them safe off the premises for a day or two, and
discover what they were out for.</p>

<p>Well, away went the <i>goum,</i> stood afar off on a
sand-hill, saw the Touaregs skirmish up to the oasis,
park their camels among the palms, and seriously set
about investing the place. He thought it was time for
him to go when they had surrounded the fort, were lining
the sand-hills, making nice little trenches in the sand,
climbing the palm trees, and pouring in a very heavy fire.
He estimated them at ten thousand rifles, so I feared
that there must be at least five hundred of the cruel
fiends. Anyhow, round wheeled Monsieur Goum and rode
hell-for-leather, night and day, for help....</p>

<p>Like <i>How we brought the good news from Aix to Ghent,</i>
and <i>Paul Revere's Ride</i> and all. I christened the <i>goum,</i>
Paul Revere, straight away, when I heard his tale, and
promised him all sorts of good things, including a good
hiding if I found he had not exceeded the speed limit all
the way from Aix to Ghent. Certainly his 'Roland' looked as
if its radiator had boiled all right. And, <i>Nom d'un nom
d'nom de bon Dieu de sort!</i> but I made a forced march of
it, my friend&mdash;and when we of the Nineteenth African
Division do <i>that,</i> even on mules and camels, you can
hardly see us go."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now! I am sure your progress is perceptible,"
said Lawrence politely. "Specially on camels, and all
that.... You're too modest," he added.</p>

<p>"I mean you can hardly see us go for dust and small
stones, by reason of our swiftness.... Any more than you
can see a bullet, witty one," rebuked de Beaujolais.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite, quite," murmured the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I was away with the advance-party on swift
<i>mehari</i> camels, a mule-squadron was following, and a
company of Senegalese would do fifty kilometres a day
on foot till they reached Zinderneuf. Yes, and, in what
I flatter myself is the unbreakable record time between
Tokotu and Zinderneuf, we arrived&mdash;and, riding far on
in advance of my men, I listened for the sound of firing or
of bugle-calls.</p>

<p>I heard no sound whatever, and suddenly topping a ridge
I came in sight of the fort&mdash;there below me on the
desert plain, near the tiny oasis.</p>

<p>There was no fighting, no sign of Touaregs, no trace
of battle or siege. No blackened ruins strewn with
mutilated corpses here. The Tri-couleur flew merrily
from the flag-staff, and the fort looked absolutely
normal&mdash;a square grey block of high, thick mud walls,
flat castellated roof, flanking towers, and lofty look-out
platform. All was well! The honour of the Flag of France
had been well defended. I waved my <i>képi</i> above my head and
shouted aloud in my glee.</p>

<p>Perhaps I began composing my Report then and there,
doing modest justice to the readiness, promptitude, and
dispatch of my little force, which had maintained the
glorious traditions of the Nineteenth African Division;
giving due praise to the <i>sous-officier</i> commanding
Zinderneuf, and not forgetting Paul Revere and his
Roland.... Meanwhile, they should know that relief was at
hand, and that, be the Touaregs near or be they far, the
danger was over and the flag safe. I, Henri de Beaujolais
of the Spahis, had brought relief. I fired my revolver half
a dozen times in the air. And then I was aware of a small
but remarkable fact. The high look-out platform at the top
of its long ladder was empty.</p>

<p>Strange! Very strange! Incredibly strange, at the very
moment when great marauding bands of Touaregs were known to
be about&mdash;and one of them had only just been beaten
off, and might attack again at any moment. I must offer
the <i>sous-officier</i> my congratulations upon the excellence
of his look-out, as soon as I had embraced and commended
him! New as he might be to independent command, this should
never have happened. One would have thought he could as
soon have forgotten his boots as his sentry on the look-out
platform.</p>

<p>A pretty state of affairs, <i>bon Dieu,</i> in time of actual
war! Here was I approaching the fort in broad light of
day, firing my revolver&mdash;and not the slightest notice
taken! I might have been the entire Touareg nation or the
whole German army....</p>

<p>No, there must be something wrong, in spite of
the peaceful look of things and the safety of the
Flag&mdash;and I pulled out my field-glasses to see if they
would reveal anything missed by the naked eye.</p>

<p>As I halted and waited for my camel to steady himself,
that I might bring the glasses to bear, I wondered if it
were possible that this was an ambush.</p>

<p>Could the Arabs have captured the place, put the
defenders to the sword, put on their uniforms, cleaned
up the mess, closed the gates, left the Flag flying, and
now be waiting for a relieving force to ride, in trustful
innocence and close formation, up to the muzzles of their
rifles? Possible&mdash;but quite unlike brother Touareg!
You know what <i>his</i> way is, when he has rushed a post or
broken a square. A dirty fighter, if ever there was one!
And as I focussed my glasses on the walls, I rejected the
idea.</p>

<p>Moreover, yes, there were the good European faces
of the men at the embrasures, bronzed and bearded, but
unmistakably not Arab....</p>

<p>And yet, that again was strange. At every embrasure
of the breast-high parapet round the flat roof stood a
soldier, staring out across the desert, and most of them
staring along their levelled rifles too; some of them
straight at me. Why? There was no enemy about. Why were
they not sleeping the sleep of tired victors, below on
their cots in the <i>caserne,</i> while double sentries watched
from the high look-out platform? Why no man up there, and
yet a man at every embrasure that I could see from where I
sat on my camel, a thousand metres distant?</p>

<p>And why did no man move; no man turn to call out to a
sergeant that a French officer approached; no man walk
to the door leading down from the roof, to inform the
Commandant of the fort!</p>

<p>Anyhow, the little force had been extraordinarily lucky,
or the shooting of the Arabs extraordinarily bad, that they
should still be numerous enough to man the walls in that
fashion&mdash;'all present and correct,' as you say in your
army&mdash;and able to stand to arms thus, after two or
three days of it, more or less.</p>

<p>As I lowered my glasses and urged my camel forward, I
came to the conclusion that I was expected, and that the
officer in charge was indulging in a little natural and
excusable <i>fantaisie,</i> showing off&mdash;what you call
'putting on the dog,' eh?</p>

<p>He was going to let me find everything as the Arabs
found it when they made their foolish attack&mdash;every
man at his post and everything <i>klim-bim.</i> Yes, that must
be it.... Ah, it was! Even as I watched, a couple of shots
were fired from the wall. They had seen me.... The fellow,
in his joy, was almost shooting <i>at</i> me, in fact!</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;nobody on the look-out platform! How I
would prick that good fellow's little bubble of swank! And
I smiled to myself as I rode under the trees of the oasis
to approach the gates of the fort.</p>

<p>It was the last time I smiled for quite a little
while.</p>

<p>Among the palm trees were little pools of dried and
blackened blood where men had fallen, or wounded men had
been laid, showing that, however intact the garrison of the
fort might be, their assailants had paid toll to the good
Lebel rifles of my friends.</p>

<p>And then I rode out from the shade of the oasis and up
to the gate.</p>

<p>Here half a dozen or so kept watch, looking out over
the wall above, as they leant in the embrasures of the
parapet. The nearest was a huge fellow, with a great bushy
grey moustache, from beneath which protruded a short wooden
pipe. His <i>képi</i> was cocked rakishly over one eye, as he
stared hard at me with the other, half closed and leering,
while he kept his rifle pointed straight at my head.</p>

<p>I was glad to feel certain that he at least was no Arab,
but a tough old legionary, a typical <i>vieille moustache,</i>
and rough soldier of fortune. But I thought his joke a poor
one and over-personal, as I looked up into the muzzle of
his unwavering rifle....</p>

<p>'<i>Congratulations, my children,</i>' I cried. '<i>France and
I are proud to salute you,</i>' and raised my <i>képi</i> in homage
to their courage and their victory.</p>

<p>Not one of them saluted. Not one of them answered. Not
one of them stirred. Neither a finger nor an eyelid moved.
I was annoyed. If this was 'making <i>fantaisie,</i>' as they
call it in the Legion, it was making it at the wrong moment
and in the wrong manner.</p>

<p>'<i>Have you of the Foreign Legion no manners?</i>' I
shouted. '<i>Go, one of you, at once, and call your
officer.</i>' Not a finger nor an eyelid moved.</p>

<p>I then addressed myself particularly to old
Grey-Moustache. '<i>You,</i>' I said, pointing up straight at
his face, '<i>go at once and tell your Commandant that Major
de Beaujolais of the Spahis has arrived from Tokotu with a
relieving force&mdash;and take that pipe out of your face
and step smartly, do you hear?</i>'</p>

<p>And then, my friend, I grew a little uncomfortable,
though the impossible truth did not dawn upon me. Why did
the fellow remain like a graven image, silent, motionless,
remote&mdash;like an Egyptian god on a temple wall, looking
with stony and unseeing eye into my puny human face?</p>

<p>Why were they all like stone statues! Why was the
fort so utterly and horribly silent? Why did nothing
<i>move,</i> there in the fierce sunlight of the dawn? Why
this tomb-like, charnel-house, inhuman silence and
immobility?</p>

<p>Where were the usual sounds and stir of an occupied
post? Why had no sentry seen me from afar and cried the
news aloud? Why had there been no clang and clatter at
the gate? Why had the gate not been opened? Why no voice,
no footstep in all the place? Why did these men ignore me
as though I were a beetle on the sand? Where was their
officer?...</p>

<p>Was this a nightmare in which I seemed for ever doomed
to ride voiceless and invisible, round endless walls,
trying to attract the attention of those who could never be
aware of me?</p>

<p>When, as in a dream, I rode right round the place, and
beheld more and more of those motionless silent forms, with
their fixed, unwinking eyes, I clearly saw that one of
them, whose <i>képi</i> had fallen from his head, had a hole in
the centre of his forehead and was dead&mdash;although at
his post, with chest and elbows leaning on the parapet, and
looking as though about to fire his rifle!</p>

<p>I am rather near-sighted, as you know, but then the
truth dawned upon me&mdash; they were <i>all</i> dead!</p>

<p>'<i>Why were they not sleeping the sleep of tired
victors?</i>' I had asked myself a few minutes before. They
<i>were....</i></p>

<p>Yes, all of them. <i>Mort sur le champ d'honneur!...</i></p>

<p>My friend, I rode back to where Grey-Moustache kept his
last watch, and, baring my head, I made my apologies to
him, and the tears came into my eyes. Yes, and I, Henri de
Beaujolais of the Spahis, admit it without shame.</p>

<p>I said, '<i>Forgive me, my friend.</i>' What would you, an
Englishman, have said?"</p>

<p>"What about a spot of tea?" quoth Mr. George Lawrence,
reaching beneath the seat for his tiffin-basket.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">After a dusty meal, impatiently swallowed
by Major de Beaujolais, that gentleman resumed his story,
with serious earnestness and some gesticulation, while,
on the opposite side of the carriage, George Lawrence lay
upon his back, his clasped hands beneath his head, idly
watching the smoke that curled up from his cheroot. But he
was paying closer attention to the Frenchman's tale.</p>

<p>"But, of course, it soon occurred to me," continued
that gentleman, "that someone must be alive.... Shots had
been fired to welcome me.... Those corpses had not of
<i>themselves</i> taken up those incredibly life-like attitudes.
Whoever had propped them up and arranged them and their
rifles in position, must be alive.</p>

<p>For, naturally, not all had been struck by Arab bullets
and remained standing in the embrasures. Nine times out of
ten, as you know, a man staggers back and falls, when shot
standing.</p>

<p>Besides, what about the wounded? There is always a
far bigger percentage of wounded than of killed in any
engagement. Yes, there must be survivors, possibly all more
or less wounded, below in the <i>caserne.</i></p>

<p>But surely <i>one</i> of them might have kept a look-out.
Probably the Commandant and all the non-commissioned
officers were killed.</p>

<p>Even then, though, one would have expected the senior
man&mdash;even if the survivors were all <i>soldats deuxième
classe</i>&mdash;to have taken that much ordinary military
precaution!...</p>

<p>Well, I would soon solve the problem, for my troop was
approaching, my trumpeter with them. I was glad to note
that my Sergeant-Major had evidently had a similar idea to
mine, for, on coming in sight of the fort, he had opened
out and skirmished up in extended order&mdash;in spite of
the bravely-flying Flag.</p>

<p>When my men arrived, I had the 'rouse,' the 'alarm,'
the Regimental Call, sounded by the trumpeter&mdash;fully
expecting, after each blast, that the gates would open, or
at least that someone would come running up from below on
to the roof.</p>

<p>Not a sound nor a movement!... Again and again; call
after call.... Not a sound nor a movement!</p>

<p>'Perhaps the last one or two are badly wounded,' thought
I. 'There may not be a man able to crawl from his bed. The
fellow who propped those corpses up may have been shot in
the act, and be lying up there, or on his cot,' and I bade
the trumpeter cease. Sending for the <i>Chef,</i> as we call
the Sergeant-Major, I ordered him to knot camel-cords,
sashes, girths, reins, anything, make a rope, and set an
active fellow to climb from the back of a camel, into an
embrasure, and give me a hoist up.</p>

<p>That Sergeant-Major is one of the bravest and coolest
men I have ever known, and his collection of <i>ferblanterie</i>
includes the Croix and the Medaille given on the field, for
valour.</p>

<p>'It is a trap, <i>mon Commandant,</i>' said he. 'Do not walk
into it. Let me go.' Brave words&mdash;but he looked queer,
and I knew that though he feared nothing living, he was
afraid.</p>

<p>'The dead keep good watch, <i>Chef,</i>' said I, and I think
he shivered.</p>

<p>'They would warn us, <i>mon Commandant,</i>' said he. 'Let me
go.'</p>

<p>'We will neither of us go,' said I. 'We will have the
courage to remain in our proper place, with our men. It may
be a trap, though I doubt it. We will send a man in, and
if it is a trap, we shall know&mdash;and without losing an
officer unnecessarily. If it is not a trap, the gates will
be opened in two minutes.'</p>

<p>'The Dead are watching and listening,' said the <i>Chef,</i>
glancing up, and he crossed himself, averting his eyes.</p>

<p>'Send me that drunken <i>mauvais sujet,</i> Rastignac,' said
I, and the Sergeant-Major rode away.</p>

<p>'May I go, <i>mon Commandant?</i>' said the trumpeter,
saluting.</p>

<p>'Silence,' said I. My nerves were getting a little on
edge, under that silent, mocking scrutiny of the watching
Dead. When the Sergeant-Major returned with a rope, and
the rascal Rastignac&mdash;whose proper place was in the
<i>Joyeux,</i> the terrible Penal Battalions of convicted
criminals&mdash;I ordered him to climb from his camel on to
the roof.</p>

<p>'Not I, <i>mon Officier,</i>' replied he promptly. 'Let me go
to Hell dead, not living. I don't mind joining corpses <i>as</i>
a corpse. You can shoot me.'</p>

<p>'That can I, of a surety,' I agreed, and drew my
revolver. 'Ride your camel under that projecting
water-spout,' said I. 'Stand on its back, and spring to the
spout. Climb into the embrasure, and then go down and open
the gates.'</p>

<p>'Not I, <i>mon Officier,</i>' said Rastignac again. I raised
my revolver, and the Sergeant-Major snatched the man's
rifle.</p>

<p>'Have you <i>le cafard?</i>' I asked, referring to the
desert-madness that, bred of monotony, boredom, misery,
and hardship, attacks European soldiers in these
outposts&mdash;especially absinthe-drinkers&mdash;and
makes them do strange things, varying from mutiny, murder,
and suicide to dancing about naked, or thinking they are
lizards or emperors or clock-pendulums.</p>

<p>'I have a dislike for intruding upon a dead Company that
stands to arms and keeps watch,' replied the fellow.</p>

<p>'For the last time&mdash;<i>go,</i>' said I, aiming between
his eyes.</p>

<p>'Go yourself, <i>Monsieur le Majeur,</i>' replied Rastignac,
and I pulled the trigger.... Was I right, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Dunno," replied Lawrence, yawning.</p>

<p>"There was a click, and Rastignac smiled. I had emptied
my revolver when approaching the fort, as I have told
you.</p>

<p>'You can live&mdash;to be court-martialled and join the
<i>Batt d'Af,</i>' said I. 'You will be well placed among the
<i>Joyeux.</i>'</p>

<p>'Better among those than the Watchers above, <i>mon
Officier,</i>' said my beauty, and I bade the Sergeant-Major
take his bayonet and put him under arrest.</p>

<p>'You may show this coward the way,' said I to the
trumpeter, and, in a minute, that one had sprung at the
spout, clutched it, and was scrambling on to the wall. He
was <i>un brave.</i></p>

<p>'We will proceed as though the place were held by an
enemy&mdash;until the gates are opened,' said I to the
Sergeant-Major, and we rode back to the troop and handed
Rastignac over to the Corporal, who clearly welcomed him in
the rôle of prisoner.</p>

<p>'<i>Vous&mdash;pour la boite,</i>' smiled the Corporal,
licking his lips. And then we watched and waited. I could
see that the men were immensely puzzled and intrigued. Not
an eye wandered. I would have given something to have known
what each man thought concerning this unique experience.
A perfectly silent fort, the walls fully manned, the Flag
flying&mdash;and the gates shut. No vestige of a sign from
that motionless garrison staring out into the desert,
aiming their rifles at nothing&mdash;and at <i>us....</i></p>

<p>We watched and waited. Two minutes passed; five; six;
<i>seven.</i> What could it mean? <i>Was</i> it a trap after all?</p>

<p>'<i>That</i> one won't return!' said Rastignac loudly, and
gave an eerie jarring laugh. The Corporal smote him on
the mouth, and I heard him growl, 'What about a little
<i>crapaudine</i> <sup>1</sup> and a mouthful of sand, my
friend?... You speak again!'...</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Torture. The hands and feet tied together
in a bunch in the middle of the back.</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes, a very <i>mauvais quart
d'heure,</i> I beckoned the Sergeant-Major. I could stand the
strain no longer.</p>

<p>'I am going in,' said I. 'I cannot send another man,
although I ought to do so. Take command.... If you do not
see me within ten minutes, and nothing happens, assault the
place. Burn down the gates and let a party climb the walls,
while another charges in. Keep a half-troop, under the
Corporal, in reserve.'</p>

<p>'Let me go, <i>mon Commandant,</i>' begged the <i>Chef,</i> 'if
you will not send another soldier. Or call for a volunteer
to go. Suppose you...'</p>

<p>'Silence, <i>Chef,</i>' I replied, 'I am going,' and I rode
back to the fort. Was I right, George?"</p>

<p>"Dunno," replied George Lawrence.</p>

<p>"I remember thinking, as I rode back, what a pernicious
fool I should look if, under the eyes of all&mdash;the
living and the dead&mdash;I failed to accomplish that, by
no means easy, scramble, and had ignominiously to admit
my inability to climb up where the trumpeter had gone. It
is sad when one's vile body falls below the standard set
by the aspiring soul, when the strength of the muscles is
inadequate to the courage of the heart....</p>

<p>However, all went well, and, after an undignified
dangling from the spout, and wild groping with the raised
foot, I got a leg over the ledge, scrambled up and crawled
into an embrasure.</p>

<p>And there I stood astounded and dumbfounded, <i>tout
bouleversé,</i> unable to believe my eyes.</p>

<p>There, as in life, stood the garrison, their backs to
me, their faces to the foe whom they had driven off, their
feet in dried pools of their own blood&mdash; watching,
watching.... And soon I forgot what might be awaiting me
below, I forgot my vanished trumpeter, I forgot my troop
waiting without&mdash;<i>for there was something else.</i></p>

<p>Lying on his back, his sightless eyes out-staring the
sun&mdash;lay the Commandant, and through his heart, <i>a
bayonet,</i> one of our long, thin French sword-bayonets with
its single-curved hilt! No&mdash;he had not been shot, he
was absolutely untouched elsewhere, and there he lay with a
French bayonet through his heart. What do you say to that,
my friend?"</p>

<p>"Suicide," replied Lawrence.</p>

<p>"And so did I, until I realised that he had a loaded
revolver in one hand, one chamber fired, and a crushed
letter in the other! <i>Does</i> a man drive a bayonet through
his heart, and then take a revolver in one hand and a sheet
of paper in the other? I think not.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a man drive a bayonet through his
heart, my friend? Believe me, he does not fumble for
letters, nor draw a revolver and fire it, after he has
done <i>that.</i> No. He gasps, stares, staggers. He grips
the handle and the <i>forte</i> of the blade with both hands,
totters, stretches convulsively, and collapses, crashing
to the ground.... In any case, does a man commit suicide
with a bayonet when he has a loaded revolver?... Suicide?
<i>Pouf.</i></p>

<p>"Was it any wonder that my jaw dropped and I forgot all
else, as I stared and stared.... <i>Voyez donc!</i> A French
fort in the Sahara, besieged by Arabs. Every man killed
at his post. The Arabs beaten off. The fort inviolate,
untrodden by Arab foot. The gates closed. Within&mdash;the
dead, and one of them slain by a French bayonet while he
held a loaded revolver in his hand!...</p>

<p>"But <i>was</i> the fort inviolate and untrodden by Arab foot?
If so, what had become of my trumpeter? Might not the Arabs
be hiding below, waiting their opportunity to catch the
relieving force unawares? Might not there be an Arab eye at
every rifle-slit? Might not the <i>caserne,</i> rooms, offices,
sheds, be packed with them?</p>

<p>"Absurdly improbable&mdash;and why should they have
slain the Commandant with a French bayonet? Would they not
have hacked him to pieces with sword and spear, and have
mutilated and decapitated every corpse in the place? Was
it like the wild Touareg to lay so clever a trap with the
propped-up bodies, that a relieving force might fall into
their hands as well? Never. <i>Peaudezébie!</i> Had the Arabs
entered here, the place would have been a looted, blackened
ruin, defiled, disgusting, strewn with pieces of what had
been men. No, this was not Arab work.</p>

<p>"These Watchers, I felt certain, had been compelled by
this dead man, who lay before me, to continue as defenders
of the fort after their deaths.... He was evidently a
<i>man.</i> A bold, resourceful, undaunted hero, sardonic, of a
macabre humour, as the Legion always is.</p>

<p>"As each man fell, throughout that long and awful day,
he had propped him up, wounded or dead, set the rifle in
its place, fired it, and bluffed the Arabs that every
wall and every embrasure and loophole of every wall was
fully manned. He must, at the last, have run from point to
point, firing a rifle from behind its dead defender. Every
now and then he must have blown the alarm that the bugler
would never blow again, in the hope that it would guide and
hasten the relieving force and impress the Arabs with fear
that the avengers must be near.</p>

<p>"No wonder the Arabs never charged that fort, from each
of whose walls a rifle cracked continuously, and from whose
every embrasure watched a fearless man whom they could not
kill&mdash;or whose place seemed to be taken, at once, by
another, if they did kill him....</p>

<p>"All this passed through my mind in a few
seconds&mdash;and as I realised what he had done and how
he had died in the hour of victory, <i>murdered,</i> my throat
swelled though my blood boiled&mdash;and I ventured to
give myself the proud privilege of kneeling beside him and
pinning my own Croix upon his breast&mdash; though I could
scarcely see to do so. I thought of how France should ring
with the news of his heroism, resource, and last glorious
fight, and how every Frenchman should clamour for the blood
of his murderer.</p>

<p>"Only a poor <i>sous-officier</i> of the Legion. But a hero
for France to honour.... And I would avenge him!</p>

<p>"Such were my thoughts, my friend, as I realised the
truth&mdash;what are yours?"</p>

<p>"Time for a spot of dinner," said George Lawrence,
starting up.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">Next morning, as the two lay awake on
their dusty bedding, begrimed, tousled, pyjama-clad,
awaiting the next stop, bath, and breakfast, de Beaujolais
lit a cigarette, turned on his side, and fixed his friend
with the earnest troubled gaze of his bright brown eye.</p>

<p>"Well, George, <i>who killed him</i>&mdash;and why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ancient Mariner!" yawned Lawrence.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I feel like the Wedding Guest."</p>

<p>"You look like one, my George," smiled the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Get on with it, Jolly."</p>

<p>"How was the Commandant of that fort killed?"</p>

<p>"Someone 'threatened his life with a railway-share.'"</p>

<p>"Be serious, little George. I want your help. I <i>must</i>
get to the bottom of this. Where did I leave off?"</p>

<p>"God knows. I was asleep."</p>

<p>"Ah! I was on the roof, pinning my Croix on the breast
of the bravest man I have ever met. Your General Gordon
in miniature! This obscure and humble soul had kept his
country's Flag flying, as that great man did at Khartoum,
and, like him, he had been relieved too late. But yes,
and there it flapped above my head and recalled me to
myself.</p>

<p>I rose, drew my revolver, loaded it, and walked to
the door. As I was about to descend into that silence I
had a little idea. I looked at each of the Watchers in
turn. No. Each man had his bayonet, of course. I had not
really supposed that one of them had stabbed his officer
and then gone back to his post and died on his feet! He
would have fallen&mdash;or possibly have hung limply
through the embrasure. I raised my weapon and descended the
stairs&mdash;expecting I know not what, in that sinister
stillness&mdash;that had swallowed up my trumpeter. And
what do you think I found there, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Dunno," said George Lawrence.</p>

<p>"<i>Nothing.</i> No one and nothing. Not even the man who
had fired the two shots of welcome!... As I had felt sure,
really, all along, no Arab had entered the fort. That
leapt to the eye at once. The place was as tight shut
as this fist of mine&mdash;and as empty of Arab traces.
The <i>caserne</i> was as orderly and tidy as when the men
left it and stood to arms&mdash;the <i>paquetages</i> on the
shelves, the table-apparatus in the hanging cupboards, the
<i>gamelles</i> and cleaning-bags at the heads of the beds,
the bedding folded and straight. There had evidently been
room-inspection just before the sentry on the look-out
platform had cried, '<i>Aux armes! Aux armes! Les Arabes!</i>'
and all had rushed to their posts.</p>

<p>No, not a thing was missing or awry. The whole place
might just have been made ready by an outgoing garrison, to
be taken over by the incoming garrison. No Arab had scaled
those walls nor wriggled through the keyhole of the gate.
The stores were untouched&mdash;the rice, the biscuits,
bread, coffee, wine, nothing was missing..."</p>

<p>"Except a rifle," grunted Lawrence.</p>

<p>"My friend, you've said it! Where was the rifle
belonging to the bayonet that was driven through the heart
of the murdered officer up above? That was precisely
the question that my crazed mind was asking itself as I
realised that the fort had never been entered.</p>

<p>Had a corpse bayoneted that <i>sous-officier,</i> returned to
its post, and flung the rifle to the horizon? Scarcely.</p>

<p>Had an Arab&mdash;expert in throwing knife or bayonet
as in throwing the <i>matrak</i>&mdash;possessed himself of a
French bayonet, after some desert-massacre of one of our
tiny expeditionary columns? And had he got near enough to
the fort to throw it? And had it by chance, or skill of
the thrower, penetrated the heart of the Commandant of the
garrison?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Lawrence.</p>

<p>"So I thought for a moment," replied de Beaujolais,
"though why a man armed with a breech-loading rifle, should
leave the cover of his sand-hill, trench, or palm tree,
and go about throwing bayonets, I don't know. And then I
remembered that the bayonet went through the breast of the
<i>sous-officier</i> in a slightly <i>upward</i> direction from front
to back. Could a bayonet be thrown thus into the middle of
a wide roof?"</p>

<p>"Sold again," murmured Lawrence.</p>

<p>"No, I had to abandon that idea. As untenable as the
returning-corpse theory. And I was driven, against common
sense, to conclude that the officer had been bayoneted
by one of his own men, the sole survivor, who had then
detached the rifle from the bayonet and fled from the fort.
But why?</p>

<p><i>Why?</i> If such was the explanation of the officer's
death&mdash;why on earth had not the murderer shot him <i>and
calmly awaited the arrival of the relieving force?</i></p>

<p>Naturally all would have supposed that the brave
Commandant had been shot, like all the rest, by the
Arabs.</p>

<p>Instead of fleeing to certain death from thirst and
starvation, or torture at the hands of the Arabs, why
had not the murderer awaited, in comfort, the honours,
<i>réclame,</i> reward, and promotion that would most assuredly
have been his? Obviously, the man who&mdash;lusting for
blood and vengeance on account of some real or fancied
wrong&mdash;could murder his superior at such a moment,
would be the very one to see the beauty of getting a rich
and glorious reward as a sequel to his revenge. Without a
doubt he would have shot him through the head, propped him
up with the rest, and accepted the congratulations of the
relieving force for having conceived and executed the whole
scheme of outwitting and defeating the Arabs. Wouldn't he,
George?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> would," replied George, scratching his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, you would. And I almost sent that theory to join
the other two wild ones&mdash;the corpse who returned to
its post, and the Arab who threw sword-bayonets from
afar. Almost&mdash;until I remembered that revolver in the
dead man's hand, and the empty cartridge-case in one of
its chambers. And then I asked myself, 'Does a man who is
conducting the defence of a block-house, against tremendous
odds, waste time in taking pot-shots <i>with a revolver</i> at
concealed enemies, two or three hundred yards distant? Does
he do that, with hundreds of rounds of rifle ammunition and
a score of rifles to his hand?' Of course not.</p>

<p>That revolver shot was fired at someone <i>in</i> the
fort. It was fired point-blank at the man who murdered
him&mdash;and the murderer must have been one of his own
men, and that man must have fled from the fort. But again,
why? Why? <i>Why?</i></p>

<p>Why not have shot his officer, as I said before? He
would never have had even the <i>need</i> to deny having done
it, for no one would have dreamt of accusing him.</p>

<p>And then I had an idea. I suddenly said to myself,
'Suppose some scoundrel bayoneted the Commandant even
before the alarm was given or the attack began&mdash;and
then organised the defence and died at his post with the
others?'</p>

<p>Led a mutiny of the garrison, perhaps; took command;
and was shot and propped up in his embrasure by someone
else. Yes, but who propped the last man up? He did not do
it himself, that was certain&mdash;for every single corpse
on that roof had been <i>arranged</i> before <i>rigor mortis</i> set
in. The only man who was not 'to the life' was one who lay
on his back. It was curious, that recumbent corpse with
closed eyes and folded hands, but I did not see that it
offered any clue. Whoever had been doing the ghastly work
of corpse-drilling had overlooked it&mdash;or, indeed, had
been going to set the dead man up when the final tragedy,
whatever it was, occurred.</p>

<p>It may have been that the brave <i>sous-officier</i> was
going to arrange this very corpse when he was attacked. Or,
as I say, the officer may have been dead the whole time, or
part of it, and the last survivor may have had this last
work cut short by a bullet, before he had put the man in
position.</p>

<p>But if so, where <i>was</i> he?... Was it the man who had
fired the two shots in answer to mine&mdash;and if so, what
had become of him? <i>Why had he fired if he wished to hide
or escape?</i></p>

<p>My head spun. I felt I was going mad.</p>

<p>And then I said to myself, '<i>Courage, mon brave!</i> Go
calmly up to that terrible roof again, and just quietly and
clearly make certain of two points. First: Is there any one
of those standing corpses who has not quite obviously been
arranged, propped up, fixed in position? If so&mdash;<i>that</i>
is the man who killed his officer and was afterwards shot
by the Arabs. Secondly: Has any one of those dead men been
shot point-blank with a revolver? (That I should be able
to tell at a glance.) If so, <i>that</i> is the man who killed
his officer&mdash;(who lived long enough to thrust his
assailant into an embrasure)....'"</p>

<p>"After himself being bayoneted through the heart!"
enquired Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Exactly what I said to myself&mdash;and groaned aloud
as I said it," replied de Beaujolais.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he continued, "I would go up and see if
any man had been shot by a revolver, and if any man lay
<i>naturally</i> against the slope of an embrasure.... I turned
to ascend the stair, and then, George, and not till then,
I got the <i>real</i> shock of that awful day of shocks. For,
<i>where was my trumpeter?</i></p>

<p>I had made a quick but complete tour of the place and
now realised in a flash that I had seen no living thing and
heard no sound.</p>

<p>'<i>Trompette! Trompette!</i>' I shouted. I rushed to the
door leading to the courtyard, the little interior,
high-walled parade ground.</p>

<p>'<i>Trompette!</i>' I shouted and yelled, again and again,
till my voice cracked.</p>

<p>Not a sound. Not a movement.</p>

<p>And then, in something like panic, putting all else from
my mind, I rushed to the gates, lifted down the great bars,
pulled the heavy bolts, turned the great key, and dragged
them open&mdash;just as the mule-squadron arrived and my
good Sergeant-Major was giving them the signal to join the
assault!</p>

<p>It was not that I had suddenly remembered that the time
I had allowed him must be up, but that I needed to see a
human being again, to hear a human voice, after a quarter
of an hour in that House of Death, that sinister-abode
of tragic mysteries. I felt an urgent and unconquerable
yearning for some..."</p>

<p>"Breakfast," said George Lawrence, as the train slowed
down.</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">Bathed, full-fed, and at peace with a
noisy world, in so far as choking dust, grilling heat,
and the weariness of three days' close confinement in a
stuffy carriage allowed, the two <i>compagnons de voyage</i> lay
and smoked the cheroot of digestion in a brief silence.
Brief, because it was not in the power of the impulsive and
eloquent <i>beau sabreur,</i> of the Spahis, to keep silence for
long upon the subject uppermost in his active and ardent
mind.</p>

<p>"<i>Georges, mon vieux,</i>" he broke silence, "do you
believe in spirits, ghosts, devils?"</p>

<p>"I firmly believe in whiskey, the ghost of a salary, and
a devil of a thin time. Seen 'em myself," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Because the only solution that my Sergeant-Major could
offer was just that....</p>

<p>'<i>Spirits! Ghosts! Devils!</i>' he whispered, when he
realised that the <i>sous-officier</i> had been murdered
apparently by a corpse, and that the trumpeter had
absolutely vanished into thin air, leaving not a trace of
himself, and effecting the evaporation of his rifle as well
as of his trumpet and everything else.</p>

<p>This was not very helpful, strongly as I was tempted to
endorse it.</p>

<p>'Sergeant-Major Dufour,' said I, 'I am going to propound
theories and you are going to find the weak points in them.
The absurdities and idiocies in them.</p>

<p>Post vedettes far out, all round the place, and let
the men fall out and water their beasts in the oasis.
Sergeant Lebaudy will be in command. Tell him that fires
may be lighted and <i>soupe</i> made, but that in an hour's time
all are to be on grave-digging fatigue. He is to report
immediately when mule-scouts from Lieutenant St. Andre's
advance Senegalese arrive from Tokotu, or if anything
happens meanwhile. If a vedette gives the alarm, all are
to enter the fort immediately&mdash;otherwise no one is
to set foot inside. Put a sentry at the gate.... You and
I will look into this <i>affaire</i> while Achmet makes us
some coffee'&mdash;and I gave the good fellow a cake of
chocolate and a measure of cognac from my flask. We were
both glad of that cognac.</p>

<p>While he was gone on this business I remained on the
roof. I preferred the sunlight while I was alone. I
freely admit it. I do not object to Arabs, but I dislike
'spirits, ghosts, and devils'&mdash;that commit murders and
abductions. Perhaps I was not quite myself. But what would
you? I had been enjoying fever; I had ridden all night;
I was perilously near <i>cafard</i> myself; and the presence
of those dead Watchers to whom I had spoken, the finding
of that incredibly murdered man, the not finding of that
more incredibly vanished trumpeter&mdash;had shaken me a
little.</p>

<p>As I awaited the return of the Sergeant-Major I gazed
at the corpse of the <i>sous-officier,</i> I stared and stared
at the face of the dead man&mdash;not too pleasant a
sight, George&mdash;contorted with rage, and pain, and
hate&mdash;dead for some hours and it was getting hot on
that roof&mdash;and there were flies... flies....</p>

<p>I stared, I say, as though I would drag the truth from
him, compel the secret of this mystery from his dead lips,
hypnotise those dead eyes to turn to mine and&mdash;but no,
it was <i>he</i> that hypnotised and compelled, until I was fain
to look away.</p>

<p>As I did so, I noticed the man who was lying near. Yes,
undoubtedly someone had carefully and reverently laid him
out. His eyes had been closed, his head propped up on a
pouch, and his hands folded upon his chest. Why had he
received such different treatment from that meted out to
the others?...</p>

<p>And then that bareheaded man. It was he&mdash;a very
handsome fellow too&mdash;who had given me my first shock
and brought it home to my wondering mind that the men who
watched me were all dead.</p>

<p>You see, all but he had their faces in the deep shade of
the big peaks of their <i>képis</i>&mdash;whilst he, bareheaded
and shot through the centre of the forehead, was dead
obviously&mdash;even to shortsighted me, looking up from
below against the strong sunlight; even to me, deceived at
first by his lifelike attitude.</p>

<p>And, as I glanced at their two <i>képis</i> lying there, I
noticed something peculiar.</p>

<p>One had been wrenched and torn from within. The lining,
newly ripped, was protruding, and the inner leather band
was turned down and outward. It was as though something had
recently been torn violently out of the cap&mdash;something
concealed in the lining perhaps?...</p>

<p>No, it was not the freak of a ricochetting bullet. The
standing man had been hit just above the nose and under the
cap, the recumbent man was hit in the chest.</p>

<p>'Now what is this?' thought I. 'A man shot through the
brain does not remove his cap and tear the lining out. He
gives a galvanic start, possibly spins round, and quietly
he falls backwards. His limbs stretch once and quiver, and
he is still for ever. His tight-fitting cap may, or may
not, fall off as he goes down&mdash;but there is no tearing
out of the lining, no turning down of the leather band.'</p>

<p>Bullets play funny tricks, I know, but not upon things
they do not touch. This bullet had been fired, I should
say, from a palm tree, and almost on a level with the roof;
anyhow, it had entered the head below the cap. There was no
hole in <i>that</i> whatsoever. To which of these two men did
the cap belong?...</p>

<p>Had all been normal in that terrible place, all lying
dead as they had fallen, I might never have noticed
this torn cap. As it was&mdash;where everything was
extraordinary, and the mind of the beholder filled with
suspicion and a thousand questions, it was most interesting
and remarkable. It became portentous. It was one more
phenomenon in that focus of phenomena!</p>

<p>And from that cap and its recently torn and still
protruding lining&mdash;oh yes, most obviously torn quite
recently, with its edging of unsoiled threads, frayed but
clean&mdash;from that cap, I looked quite instinctively at
the paper crushed in the left hand of the dead officer.
I know not why I connected these two things in my mind.
They connected themselves perhaps&mdash;and I was about to
take the paper from the rigid fist, when I thought, 'No!
Everything shall be done in order and with correctness. I
will touch nothing, do nothing, until the Sergeant-Major
returns and I have a witness.'</p>

<p>If I was to be <i>procureur, juge d'instruction,</i> judge
and jury, coroner, and perhaps, avenger&mdash;everything
should be done in due form&mdash;and my report upon the
impossible affair be of some value, too.</p>

<p>But without touching the paper, I could see, and I
saw with surprise&mdash; though the <i>bon Dieu</i> knows I
had not much capacity for surprise left in my stunned
mind&mdash;that the writing was in English!</p>

<p>Why should <i>that</i> be added to my conundrums?... A paper
with English writing on it, in the hand of a dead French
officer in a block-house in the heart of the <i>Territoire
Militaire</i> of the Sahara!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the bloke was English," suggested Lawrence. "I
have heard that there are some in the Legion."</p>

<p>"No," was the immediate reply. "That he most certainly
was not. A typical Frenchman of the Midi&mdash;a stoutish,
florid, blue-jowled fellow of full habit. Perhaps a
Provençal&mdash;thousands like him in Marseilles, Arles,
Nîmes, Avignon, Carcassonne, Tarascon. Might have been
the good Tartarin himself. Conceivably a Belgian;
<i>possibly</i> a Spaniard or Italian, but most certainly not an
Englishman.... Still less was the standing man, an olive-
cheeked Italian or Sicilian."</p>

<p>"And the recumbent bareheaded chap?" said Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;quite another affair, that! He might very
well have been English. In fact, had I been asked to guess
at his nationality, I should have said, 'A Northerner
certainly, English most probably.' He would have been
well in the picture in the Officers' Mess of one of your
regiments. Just the type turned out by your Public Schools
and Universities by the thousand.</p>

<p>What you are thinking is exactly what occurred to me.
English writing on the paper; an English-looking legionary;
his cap lying near the man who held the paper crushed in
his hand; the lining just torn out of the cap!... Ha! Here
was a little glimmer of light, a possible clue. I was just
reconstructing the scene when I heard the Sergeant-Major
ascending the stair....</p>

<p>Had this Englishman killed the <i>sous-officier</i> while the
latter tore some document from the lining of the man's cap?
Obviously not. The poor fellow's bayonet was in its sheath
at his side, and if he <i>had</i> done it&mdash; how had he got
himself put into position?"</p>

<p>"Might have been shot afterwards," said Lawrence.</p>

<p>"No. He was <i>arranged,</i> I tell you," was the reply, "and
he most assuredly had not arranged himself. Besides, he was
bareheaded. Does a man go about bareheaded in the afternoon
sun of the Sahara? But to my mind the question doesn't
arise&mdash;in view of the fact of that inexplicable
bayonet.</p>

<p>One bayonet more than there were soldiers and rifles!</p>

<p>No&mdash;I ceased reconstructing the scene with <i>that</i>
one as the slayer, and I had no reason to select anyone
else for the rôle.... Then I heard the bull voice of
Sergeant Lebaudy, down in the oasis, roar '<i>Formez les
faisceaux</i>' and '<i>Sac à terre,</i>' and came back to facts as
the Sergeant-Major approached and saluted.</p>

<p>'All in order, <i>mon Commandant,</i>' reported he, and fell
to eyeing the corpses.</p>

<p>'Even to half-smoked cigarettes in their mouths!'
he whispered. '<i>The fallen who were not allowed to
fall&mdash;the dead forbidden to die.</i>' Then&mdash;'But
where in the name of God is Jean the Trumpeter?'</p>

<p>'Tell me that, <i>Chef,</i> and I will fill your <i>képi</i> with
twenty-franc pieces&mdash;and give you the Grand Cross of
the Legion of Honour,' said I.</p>

<p>The Sergeant-Major blasphemed, crossed himself, and then
said, 'Let us get out of here while we can.'</p>

<p>'Are you a Sergeant-Major or a young lady?' I
enquired&mdash;and as one does, in such circumstances,
rated him soundly for feeling exactly as I did myself; and
the more I said, the more angry and unreasonable I grew.
You know how one's head and one's nerves get, in that
accursed desert, George."</p>

<p>"I know, old son," agreed Lawrence. "I have found myself
half-ready to murder a <i>piccin,</i> for dropping a plate."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the best of us get really insane at times, in
that hellish heat and unnatural life.... But I got a hold
upon myself and felt ashamed&mdash;for the good fellow took
it well.</p>

<p>'Did Your Excellency make a thorough search?' he asked,
rebukingly polite.</p>

<p>'But, my dear <i>Chef,</i> what need to make a thorough
search for a living man, a hale and hearty, healthy
soldier, in a small place into which he had been sent to
open a gate? <i>Mon Dieu!</i> he has legs! He has a tongue
in his head! If he were here, wouldn't he <i>be</i> here?' I
asked.</p>

<p>'Murdered perhaps,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'By whom? Beetles? Lizards?' I sneered.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and pointed to the
<i>sous-officier</i> with a dramatic gesture.</p>

<p>That one had not been murdered by beetles or lizards!</p>

<p>'Yes,' said I. 'Now we'll reconstruct this crime, first
reading what is on this paper,' and I opened the stiffened
fingers and took it. There was a dirty crumpled torn
envelope there, too. Now <i>Georges, mon vieux,</i> prepare
yourself. You are going to show a little emotion, my frozen
Englishman!"</p>

<p>Lawrence smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"It was a most extraordinary document," continued de
Beaujolais. "I'll show it to you when we get on board the
ship. It was something like this: On the envelope was,
'<i>To the Chief of Police of Scotland Yard and all whom it
may concern.</i>' And on the paper, '<i>Confession. Important.
Urgent. Please publish.</i></p>

<p><i>For fear that any innocent person may be suspected, I
hereby fully and freely confess that it was I, and I alone,
who stole the great sapphire known as 'Blue Water.'</i>"...</p>

<p>"What!" shouted George Lawrence, jumping up. "What?
<i>What</i> are you saying, de Beaujolais?"</p>

<p>"Aha! my little George," smiled the Frenchman, gloating.
"And where is the <i>phlegme Britannique</i> now, may I ask?
That made you sit up, quite literally, didn't it? We do not
yawn now, my little George, do we?"</p>

<p>George Lawrence stared at his friend, incredulous,
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"<i>But that is Lady Brandon's jewel!</i>... What on
earth..." stammered Lawrence, sitting down heavily. "Are
you romancing, de Beaujolais? Being funny?"</p>

<p>"I am telling you what was written on this
paper&mdash;which I will show you when I can get at my
dispatch-case, my friend," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Good God, man! <i>Lady Brandon!...</i> Do you mean to say
that the 'Blue Water' has been pinched&mdash;and that
the thief took refuge in the Foreign Legion, or drifted
there somehow?" asked Lawrence, lying back on his roll of
bedding.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to say anything&mdash;except to tell my
little tale, the dull little tale that has bored you so, my
George," replied de Beaujolais, with a malicious grin.</p>

<br>
<a id="pic2"></a>

<p class="caption">Could the galant "Beau" be the thief?</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>George Lawrence swung his feet to the ground and
stood up again. Never had his friend seen this reserved,
taciturn, and unemotional man so affected.</p>

<p>"I don't get you. I don't take it in," he said. "Lady
Brandon's stone! <i>Our</i> Lady Brandon? The 'Blue Water' that
we used to be allowed to look at sometimes? Stolen!... And
you have found it?"...</p>

<p>"I have found nothing, my friend, but a crumpled and
bloodstained piece of paper in a dead man's hand," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"With Lady Brandon's name on it! It's absurd, man....
In the middle of the Sahara! And <i>you</i> found it.... With
her name on it!... Well, I'm absolutely damned!" ejaculated
Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend. And perhaps you begin to realise
how 'absolutely damned' I was, when I read that
paper&mdash;sticky with blood. But probably I was
not as surprised as you are now. Even that could not
have surprised me very much then, I think," said de
Beaujolais.</p>

<p>Lawrence sat down.</p>

<p>"Go on, old chap," he begged. "I sincerely apologise
for my recent manners. Please tell me everything, and then
let us thrash it out.... Lady Brandon!... The 'Blue Water'
stolen!"...</p>

<p>"No need for apologies, my dear George," smiled his
friend. "If you seemed a little unimpressed and bored
at times, it only gave me the greater zest for the
<i>dénouement,</i> when you should hear your... our... friend's
name come into this extraordinary story."</p>

<p>"You're a wily and patient old devil, Jolly," said the
astounded Lawrence. "I salute you, Sir. A logical old cuss,
too! Fancy keeping <i>that</i> back until now, and telling the
yarn neatly, in proper sequence and due order, until the
right point in the story was reached, and then..."</p>

<p>"Aha! the <i>phlegme Britannique,</i> eh, George!" chuckled
de Beaujolais. "Wonderful how the volatile and impetuous
Frenchman could do it, wasn't it? And there is something
else to come, my friend. All in 'logical proper sequence
and due order' there comes another little surprise."</p>

<p>"Then, for God's sake get on with it, old chap!... More
about Lady Brandon, is it?" replied Lawrence, now all
animation and interest.</p>

<p>"Indirectly, <i>mon cher Georges.</i> For that paper was
signed&mdash;<i>by whom?</i>"asked the Frenchman, leaning
forward, tapping his friend's knee, staring impressively
with narrowed eyes into those of that bewildered
gentleman.</p>

<p>And into the ensuing silence he slowly and deliberately
dropped the words, "<i>By Michael Geste!</i>"</p>

<p>Lawrence raised himself on his elbow and stared at his
friend incredulous.</p>

<p>"By <i>Michael Geste!</i> Her nephew! You don't mean to tell
me that <i>Michael Geste</i> stole her sapphire and slunk off to
the Legion? 'Beau' Geste! <i>Get</i> out..." he said, and fell
back.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to tell you anything, my friend, except
that the paper was signed 'Michael Geste.'"</p>

<p>"Was the bareheaded man he? Look here, <i>are</i> you pulling
my leg?"</p>

<p>"I do not know who the man was, George. And I am not
pulling your leg. I saw two or three boys and two so
beautiful girls, once, at Brandon Abbas, years ago. This
man might have been one of them. The age would be about
right. And then, again, this man may have had nothing on
earth to do with the paper. Nor any other man on that roof,
except the <i>sous-officier</i>&mdash;and he most certainly
was not Michael Geste. He was a man of forty or forty-five
years, and as I have said, no Englishman."</p>

<p>"Michael would be about twenty or so," said Lawrence.
"He was the oldest of the nephews.... But, my dear Jolly,
the Gestes don't <i>steal!</i> They are her nephews.... I am
going to put some ice on my head."</p>

<p>"I have wanted a lot of ice to the head, the last few
weeks, George. What, too, of the murdered <i>sous-officier</i>
and the utterly "vanished trumpeter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn your trumpeter and <i>sous-officier,</i>" was
the explosive reply. "Michael Geste!... Lady Brandon....
Forgive me, old chap, and finish the story..." and George
Lawrence lay back on his couch and stared at the roof of
the carriage.</p>

<p>Lady Brandon! The only woman in the world.</p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p class="first">And as the train rumbled on through the
sweltering coast-lands toward Lagos, Major de Beaujolais,
highly pleased with the success of his neat and clever
little <i>coup,</i> continued his story.</p>

<p>"Well, my George, figure me there, with this new
astoundment, this extraordinary accompaniment to the
sinister and bewildering mystery of an inexplicable murder
and an inexplicable disappearance....</p>

<p>"And then, 'What is in the paper, might one respectfully
enquire, <i>mon Commandant,</i>' asked the Sergeant-Major.</p>

<p>"'The confession of a thief&mdash;that he stole a famous
jewel,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'Which was the thief?' said he.</p>

<p>"'Oh, ask me some questions, my good imbecile!' said I.
'Ask me where the trumpeter is, and whose is this bayonet,
and who disposed these dead men as defenders, and who
fired two shots, and whether I am mad or dreaming,' I
answered&mdash;and then pulled myself together. 'Now come
with me,' I bade him. 'We will make one more search below,
and then <i>déjeuner,</i> and a quiet, sensible, reasonable
discussion of the facts, before we bury these brave
fellows, detail an <i>escouade</i> of our men as garrison, and
return to Tokotu. I shall leave you in command here until
we get orders and reliefs.'</p>

<p>"The Sergeant-Major looked distinctly dubious at this.
'<i>Here</i>&mdash;for weeks!' he said softly.</p>

<p>"We made our tour below, and, as before, nothing unusual
met the eye, and there was no sign of the trumpeter, alive
or dead. We had seen him climb on to that parapet and
apparently no living eye had beheld him again.</p>

<p>"I was past wonder. I accepted things.</p>

<p>"Very well, this was a place where Commandants are
murdered by non-existent people; soldiers vanish like
a whiff of smoke; and English letters concerning one's
friends are found in the hands of dead Frenchmen. Very
good. Be it so. We would 'carry on' as you say, and do our
duty.</p>

<p>"'Think hard&mdash;and be prepared to pick holes in
the theories I shall propound an hour hence,' said I to
the Sergeant-Major, as we passed out of the gate, and
I proceeded to the oasis where my excellent Achmet had
prepared my soup and coffee....</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> do not want to hear my theories, George, and
there was no need for the Sergeant-Major to point out the
impossibilities and absurdities in them. They leapt to the
eye immediately.</p>

<p>"It all came back to the bald facts that there must be a
soldier of the garrison missing, that he must have taken
his rifle and left his bayonet in the <i>sous-officier,</i>
instead of shooting him and awaiting praise and
reward; that my trumpeter had vanished; that the dead
<i>sous-officier</i> had been in possession of a confession,
real or bogus, to the effect that Michael Geste had stolen
his aunt's famous sapphire.</p>

<p>"There it was&mdash;and nothing but lunacy could result
from theory-making about the <i>sous-officier's</i> murder, the
trumpeter's disappearance, or Michael Geste's confession
and how it got there.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you do not want to hear those perfectly futile
theories&mdash;those explanations that explained nothing.
But it may interest you to hear that I was faced that
evening, on top of the rest of my little pleasures, with a
military mutiny."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" ejaculated Lawrence, turning to the
speaker.</p>

<p>"Yes. At four o'clock I ordered the Sergeant-Major to
fall the men in, and I would tell off the new garrison for
Zinderneuf.</p>

<p>"In a most unusual manner the Sergeant-Major hung fire,
so to speak, instead of stepping smartly off about his
duty.</p>

<p>"'Well?' said I sharply.</p>

<p>"'There is going to be trouble, <i>mon Commandant,</i>' he
faltered.</p>

<p>"'<i>Mon Dieu,</i> there is!' I snapped, 'and <i>I</i> am going to make it, if I have any nonsense. What do you mean?'</p>

<p>"'Sergeant Lebaudy says that Corporal Brille says that
the men say...'</p>

<p>"'Name of the Name of the Name of Ten Thousand Thundering
Tin Devils,' I shouted.... 'You say that he says that they
say that she says,' I mocked. '<i>Va t'en, grand babbilard!</i>'
I roared at him. 'I'll be on parade outside those gates in
ten seconds, and if you and your gibbering chatterboxes
are not awaiting me there at attention...' and my poor
Sergeant-Major fled.</p>

<p>"I was the more angry at his news, for I had
subconsciously expected something of the sort.</p>

<p>"What else, with these ignorant, superstitious clods,
who were the bravest of the brave against human foes? None
like them. Every man a hero in battle.... But what of that
House of Death with its Watchers? That place into which
their comrade had boldly climbed&mdash;and never come forth
again.</p>

<p>"Rastignac had begun it. And they had seen him face
instant death rather than enter it&mdash;Rastignac, the
fearless reckless devil, whose bravery alone had prevented
his escapades from bringing him to a court-martial and the
Zephyrs. He, of all men, was afraid of the place. There is
nothing so infectious as <i>that</i> sort of panic....</p>

<p>"Well! One more fact to accept.</p>

<p>"If the men would not enter the fort of Zinderneuf, they
would not enter the fort of Zinderneuf&mdash;and that was
that.</p>

<p>"But if the will of these scoundrels was coming into
conflict with the will of Henri de Beaujolais, there were
exciting times ahead. Since they sought sorrow they should
certainly find it&mdash;and as I put on my belt and boots
again, I felt a certain elation.</p>

<p>"'Action is always action, <i>mon Henri,</i>' said I to
myself, 'and it will be a change from these thrice-accursed
theories and attempts to explain the inexplicable and
reconcile the irreconcilable.'</p>

<p>"Bah! I would teach my little dogs to show their teeth,
and I rode, on a mule, over to the fort. There I bade
Dufour and Lebaudy select an <i>escouade</i> of the worst men,
all <i>mauvais sujets</i> of that Company. They should garrison
either Zinderneuf fort, or else the grave that had been
dug for those brave 'fallen who had not been allowed to
fall.'...</p>

<p>"As I rode up, the Sergeant-Major Dufour called the
men to attention, and they stood like graven images, the
selected <i>escouade</i> on the right, while I made an eloquent
speech, the funeral oration of that brave band to whom we
were about to give a military funeral with all the last
honours that France could render to the worthy defenders of
her honour and her Flag.</p>

<p>"Tears stood in my eyes and my voice broke as I concluded
by quoting:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"'Soldats de la Légion,<br>
De la Légion Étrangère,<br>
N'ayant pas de nation,<br>
La France est votre mère.'</p>
<br>

<p>"Then, when the selected new garrison got the order,
'<i>Par files de quatre. En avant. Marche,</i>' that they might
march into the fort and begin their new duties by bringing
the dead out for burial&mdash;they did something quite
otherwise.</p>

<p>"Taking the time from the right, with smartness and
precision they stooped as one man, laid their rifles on the
ground, rose as one man and stood at attention!</p>

<p>"The right-hand man, a grizzled veteran of Madagascar,
Tonquin, and Dahomey, took a pace forward, saluted,
and with wooden face, said, 'We prefer to die with
Rastignac.'</p>

<p>"This was flat disobedience and rank mutiny. I had hardly
expected quite this.</p>

<p>"'But Rastignac is not going to die. He is going to
live&mdash;long years, I hope&mdash;in the <i>Joyeux.</i> You,
however, who are but cowardly sheep, led astray by him,
shall have the better fate. You shall die now, or enter
Zinderneuf fort and do your duty.... Sergeant-Major, have
those rifles collected. Let the remainder of the Company
right form, and on the order '<i>Attention pour les feux
de salve,</i>' the front rank will kneel, and on the order,
"<i>Feu,</i>" every man will do his duty.'</p>

<p>"But I knew better, George. That was precisely what
they <i>wouldn't</i> do; and I felt that this was my last
parade. That accursed fort was still exerting its horrible
influence. These fools feared that it would kill them if
they entered it, and I feared it would kill them if they
did not. For let me but handle them wrongly now, and they
would shoot me and the non-commissioned officers and march
off into the desert to certain death, as they weakened from
thirst and starvation. They would be harried and hunted and
herded along by the Arabs, and daily reduced in numbers
until a sudden rush swept over them and nothing remained
for the survivors but horrible tortures.</p>

<p>"Mutinous dogs they might be, and fools they
were&mdash;but no less would the responsibility for
their sufferings and deaths be mine if I mishandled the
situation. I thought of other desert-mutinies in the
Legion.</p>

<p>"It was an awkward dilemma, George. If I ordered the
Company to fire upon the squad, they would refuse and would
thereby become mutineers themselves. They would then feel
that they might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, and,
having shot me, take their chance of escape and freedom.</p>

<p>"If, on the other hand, I condoned this refusal of the
<i>escouade&mdash;</i> what of military discipline? Duty to my
country came before my duty to these fellows, and I must
not allow any pity for their probable fate to come between
me and my duty as a French officer.</p>

<p>"I decided that if they <i>would</i> die, then die they
must&mdash;but I at least could do my best to save them.
Without deviating from the path of duty, I would hold out a
hand to them.</p>

<p>"If the <i>escouade</i> would not enter the fort they must
expiate their military crime. If the company would not
carry out my orders and fire on the mutineers, they must
expiate <i>their</i> crime.</p>

<p>"If I were to be shot, I should at least be saved the
unpleasantness of reporting that my men had mutinied, and I
should die in the knowledge that I had done my duty.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I would make it clear that disobedience to my
orders would be death. Swift and sudden for some, lingering
and horrible for many, sure and certain for all. Then I
would 'carry on' as you say. Was I right, George?"</p>

<p>"I think you were quite right, Jolly," agreed
Lawrence.</p>

<p>"As I was deciding thus, all in the space of a few
seconds, with every eye upon me and a terrible tension
drawing every face," continued de Beaujolais, "the
Sergeant-Major approached and saluted. I eyed him coldly.
With his back to the men, he whispered:</p>

<p>"'They won't do it, <i>mon Commandant.</i> For God's sake
do not give the order. They are rotten with <i>cafard</i> and
over-fatigue. That Rastignac is their hero and leader. They
will shoot you and desert <i>en masse....</i> A night's rest
will work wonders.... Besides, Lieutenant St. André and
the Senegalese will be here by midnight. It is full moon
to-night.'</p>

<p>"'And shall we sit and wait for the Senegalese, Dufour?'
I whispered back. 'Would you like to ask these fellows to
spare us till they come?'</p>

<p>"And looking from him to the men I said loudly:</p>

<p>"'You are too merciful, Sergeant-Major. We don't do
things thus in the Spahis. But these are not Spahis.
However, in consideration of the most excellent march
the men have made, I will do as you beg and give these
<i>cafard</i>-stricken fools till moon-rise. It gives me no
pleasure to inflict punishment, and I hope no man will
insist on being punished. We are all tired, and since you
intercede for your men I grant a four-hour holiday. At
moon-rise, our motto is "<i>Work or die.</i>" Till then, all
may rest. After then, the dead will be buried and the fort
garrisoned. I hope there will be no <i>more</i> dead to be
buried to-night.'</p>

<p>"And I rode back to the oasis, hearing as I did so
the voice of the Sergeant-Major, exhorting the men and
concluding with the order, '<i>Rompez</i>.'</p>

<p>"He joined me a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"'They'll never do it, <i>mon Commandant,</i>' said he.
'They'll fear the place worse than ever by moonlight. In
the morning we could call for volunteers to accompany us.
And then the Senegalese...'</p>

<p>"'That will do, Dufour,' said I. 'They will render
instant obedience at moon-rise, or take the consequences.
I have strained my military conscience already to satisfy
my private conscience. If, after four hours' rest and
reflection, they still decide to mutiny&mdash;on their
heads be it! No responsibility rests on me. If they mutiny,
they do it in cold blood. If they obey orders before
the Senegalese arrive, no great harm has been done, and
discipline has been maintained. That is the very utmost
length to which I can go in my desire to save them.'</p>

<p>"'To save <i>them, mon Commandant!</i> It is <i>you</i> I am trying to save,' stammered the good fellow.</p>

<p>"Patting him on the shoulder as he turned to go, I
bade him send me a couple of the most influential men
of the <i>escouade</i> and two or three of the best of the
remainder&mdash;leaders of different cliques, if there were
any.</p>

<p>"I would point out to them the inevitable and awful
results to the men themselves, of disobedience and mutiny.
I would speak of the heroism, discipline, and dutifulness
of the dead. I would point out to them that in the event of
mutiny, they themselves would either be loyal and die at
the hands of the mutineers, or become deserters and die at
the hands of the Arabs. I would then send them back among
their fellows&mdash;and abide the issue....</p>

<p>"It was while I awaited their arrival that I wished our
army more resembled yours in one particular&mdash;the
relationship between officers and men. Our fellows get too
much noncommissioned officer and too little officer. We are
too remote from them. We do not play games with them, get
to know them, interest ourselves in them as fellow human
beings, in the way that your officers do. Too often it is
a case with us of hated non-coms. and stranger-officers.
Particularly is this so in the Legion. The non-coms. are
all-powerful and tyrannical; the officers are utterly
uninterested in the men as individuals, and do not even
know their names.</p>

<p>"And I was not one of their own officers of the Legion.
I was a Spahi officer, superintending the organising of
mule-cavalry out of infantry; or rather, making ordinary
infantry into mounted infantry, that the Legion might hope
to compete with the Touaregs in mobility. We wanted mounted
riflemen down there just as you did in the Boer War, or
else the Arabs served us as the Boers did you at first.</p>

<p>"I certainly had not been unduly harsh or oppressive
during the time I had been with this particular lot; but,
on the other hand, I certainly had no <i>personal</i> influence
with them. I did not know them, nor they me, and all our
lives seemed likely to be forfeit in consequence....</p>

<p>"However, I talked to the men whom Dufour brought, and
did my best under the heavy handicap of not so much as
knowing their names. Finally, I dismissed them with the
words:</p>

<p>"'For your lives, influence your friends wisely and well,
and get it into their heads that at moon-rise we will have
obedience with honour and safety, or disobedience with
dishonour, misery, and death. For at moon-rise, the chosen
<i>escouade</i> will enter the fort and bring out the dead,
or the company will fire upon them.... <i>Au</i> '<i>voir, mes
enfants.</i>'</p>

<p>"Of course, I knew the danger of making any reference to
what would happen if the company refused to fire on the
<i>escouade</i>&mdash;but it was foolish to pretend to ignore
the possibility of such a thing. But I made no allusion to
the Senegalese, and the coercion or punishment of white men
by black.</p>

<p>"It <i>might</i> be that the company would obey orders, if the
<i>escouade</i> remained mutinous, and it <i>might</i> be that all
would reflect upon the coming of the Senegalese.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I was on a knife-edge, and all depended upon the
effect on these rascals of a four-hour rest and the words
of the men to whom I had talked. There was just a chance
that St. André and his Senegalese might arrive in time to
influence the course of affairs&mdash;but I most certainly
could not bring myself to postpone the issue until his
arrival, and then take shelter behind the blacks. With the
full moon well up in the sky&mdash;by its beautiful soft
light&mdash;we should see what we should see...</p>

<p>"And then, just as the men turned to go, I had an idea.
Suppose some of them would volunteer to go over the fort
with me; see for themselves that there was nothing to be
afraid of; and then report to their fellows that all was
well.</p>

<p>"Their statement and the inevitable airs of superiority
which they would give themselves, might well counteract
Rastignac's influence and their superstitious fears. If
some of these men, selected for character and influence,
went back in the spirit of, 'Well, cowards, <i>we</i> have
been in there and it is much the same as any other such
cursed hole&mdash;except that somebody had a great idea for
diddling the Arabs,' the others would probably take the
line, 'Well, where you can go, we can. Who are <i>you</i> to
swagger?'</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I would try it. Not as though I were really
persuading or beseeching, and anxious to prove that the
<i>escouade</i> had nothing to fear if sent to garrison the
place. No&mdash;merely as offering them, superior soldiers,
an opportunity of seeing the fort before its remarkable
dispositions were disturbed.</p>

<p>"'Wait a moment,' said I, as they saluted and turned to
go. 'Is there a man of courage among you&mdash;a man, <i>par
exemple</i> such as the trumpeter, brave enough to enter an
empty fort with me?'</p>

<p>"They looked sheepish for a moment. Someone murmured,
'And where <i>is</i> Jean the Trumpeter?' and then I heard a
curious whispered remark:</p>

<p>"'<i>Gee! I sure would like to see a ghost, Buddy,</i>' and
the whispered reply:</p>

<p>"'<i>Sure thing, Hank, and I'd like to see ole Brown some
more.</i>'</p>

<p>"Two men stepped forward as one, and saluted.</p>

<p>"They were in extraordinary contrast in body, and some
similarity in face, for one was a giant and the other not
more than five feet in height, while both had clean-shaven
leathery countenances, somewhat of the bold Red Indian
type.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean&mdash;lean hatchet faces, biggish
noses, mouths like a straight gash, and big chins. By
their grey eyes they were Northerners, and by their speech
Americans.</p>

<p>"'You would like to see the fort and how it was manned to
the last by heroes&mdash;victorious in death?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'<i>Oui, mon Commandant,</i>' they replied together.</p>

<p>"'Isn't there a <i>Frenchman</i> among you?' I asked the
rest.</p>

<p>"Another man, a big sturdy Gascon he looked, saluted and
joined the Americans. Then what they now call 'the herd
instinct' and 'mob-psychology' came into play, and the
others did the same.</p>

<p>"Good! I had got the lot. I would take them round the
fort as though doing honour to the dead and showing them as
an example&mdash;and then I suddenly remembered..."</p>

<p>"The murdered <i>sous-officier</i>," said George Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Exactly, George! These fellows must not see him lying
there with a French bayonet through him! I must go in
first, alone, and give myself the pleasant task of removing
the bayonet. I would cover his face, and it would be
assumed that he had been shot and had fallen where he lay.
Yes, that was it....</p>

<p>"'Good! You shall come with me then,' said I, 'and have
the privilege of treading holy ground and seeing a sight of
which to talk to your grandchildren when you are old men.
You can also tell your comrades of what you have seen, and
give them a fresh pride in their glorious Regiment,' and I
bade the Sergeant-Major march them over to the fort.</p>

<p>"Mounting my mule, which had not been unsaddled, I
rode quickly across to the gate. The sentry had been
withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Dismounting, I hurried up to the roof, to perform the
distasteful duty I could not very well have delegated to
the Sergeant-Major. I emerged from the darkness of the
staircase on to the roof.</p>

<p>"And there I stood and stared and stared and rubbed my
eyes&mdash;and then for a moment felt just a little faint
and just a little in sympathy with those poor superstitious
fools of the <i>escouade....</i> For, my dear George, <i>the body
of the sous-officier was no longer there!</i> Nor was that of
the bareheaded recumbent man!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" ejaculated Lawrence, raising himself on his
elbow and turning to de Beaujolais.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what I said," continued the other. "What
else was there to say? <i>Were</i> there djinns, afrites, evil
spirits in this cursed desert, even as the inhabitants
declared? Was the whole thing a nightmare? Had I dreamt
that the body of a French <i>sous-officier</i> had lain here,
with a French bayonet through it? Or was I dreaming now?</p>

<p>"And then I think my temperature went up two or three
degrees from the mere hundred and two that one disregards;
for I remember entertaining the wild idea that perhaps
a living man was shamming dead among these corpses.
Moreover, I remember going round from corpse to corpse and
questioning them. One or two that seemed extra lifelike I
took by the arm, and as I shouted at them, I shook them and
pulled at them until they fell to the ground, their rifles
clattering down with them.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I heard the feet of men upon the stair,
and pulled myself together. The Sergeant-Major and the
half-dozen or so of legionaries came out on to the roof.</p>

<p>"I managed to make my little speech as they stared
round in amazement, the most amazed of all being the
Sergeant-Major, who gazed at the smeared pool of blood
where the body of the <i>sous-officier</i> had lain.</p>

<p>"The two Americans seemed particularly interested, and
appeared to be looking for comrades among the dead.</p>

<p>"When would one of the men salute and ask respectfully
the first of the hundred questions that must be puzzling
them: '<i>Where is their officer?</i>'</p>

<p>"And what should I reply? They could see for themselves
that the Arabs had not entered and carried him off. Perhaps
their minds were too full of the question: '<i>Where is
Jean the Trumpeter?</i>' for the other question to formulate
itself.</p>

<p>"I had made no reference to the disappearance of the
trumpeter; but I knew that they had seen him enter the fort
and had waited, as I did, for an astounding quarter of an
hour, to see him come out again. They had watched me go
in alone, at the end of that time, and had seen me emerge
alone. What could I say?</p>

<p>"It seemed to me to be best to say nothing on that
subject, so I said it.</p>

<p>"After a few minutes that seemed like a few hours, I bade
Dufour take the men round the outbuildings, and then march
them back to the oasis.</p>

<p>"As he disappeared, last, down the stair, I called him
back and we were alone together. Simultaneously we said the
same words: '<i>Did you move it?</i>'&mdash;and each of us knew
that the other knew nothing about it!</p>

<p>"I laughed loudly, if not merrily, and the Sergeant-Major
produced the oath of a lifetime; in length and originality,
remarkable even for the Legion.</p>

<p>"'Quite so, <i>Chef</i>,' said I.... 'Life grows a little
complicated.'</p>

<p>"'I'll give a complicated death to this <i>farceur,</i> when I
find...' growled he as I motioned him to be off. 'Blood of
the devil, I will!'</p>

<p>"He clattered down the stairs, and, soon after, I heard
his voice below, as he led the group of men across the
courtyard.</p>

<p>"'Not much here to terrify the great Rastignac, <i>hein?</i>'
he jeered.</p>

<p>"'But there is certainly something here to terrify <i>me,</i>
my friend,' I observed to myself, and made my way back to
my mule and the oasis.... In fact, I fled....</p>

<p>"Well, George, <i>mon vieux,</i> what do you think happened!
Did the <i>escouade</i> obey and enter the fort like lambs, or
did they refuse and successfully defy me, secure in the
knowledge that the others would not fire on them?"</p>

<p>"You are alive to tell the tale, Jolly," was the reply.
"That's the main thing."</p>

<p>"On account of the importance of a part of it to you, my
George, eh?" smiled the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all, old chap," Lawrence hastened to say,
with a somewhat guilty smile. "Simply on account of the
fact that you are spared to France and to your friends."</p>

<p>"I thank you, my little George. Almost might you be a
Frenchman," said de Beaujolais, with an ironical bow. "But
tell me, what do you think happened? Did they obey and
enter, or did they refuse?"</p>

<p>"Give it up, Jolly. I can only feel sure that one of the
two happened," replied Lawrence.</p>

<p>"And that is where you are wrong, my friend, for neither
happened," continued de Beaujolais. "They neither obeyed
and entered, nor disobeyed and stayed out!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" ejaculated Lawrence. "What then?"</p>

<p>And this time it was the Frenchman who suggested a
little refreshment.</p>

<h3>§ 8</h3>

<p class="first">"Well, this is the last 'event' on that
remarkable programme, <i>mon cher Georges,</i>" resumed de
Beaujolais a little later. "A very appropriate and suitable
one too.... '<i>A delightful open-air entertainment concluded
with fireworks,</i>' as the reporters of <i>fêtes champêtres</i>
say."</p>

<p>"Fireworks? Rifle-fire works do you mean?" asked
Lawrence.</p>

<p>"No, my George, nothing to speak of. Just fireworks.
Works of fire.... I will tell you....</p>

<p>"I let the moon get well up, and then sent my servant,
Achmet, for the Sergeant-Major, and bade that good fellow
to parade the men as before, with the fort a hundred paces
in their rear, the garrison <i>escouade</i> on the right of the
line.</p>

<p>"This party would either march into the fort or not.
If <i>not</i>&mdash;then the remainder would be ordered
to right-form and shoot them where they stood, for
disobedience in the field, practically in the presence of
the enemy.</p>

<p>"The remainder would either obey or not. If
<i>not</i>&mdash;then I would at once give the order to 'pile
arms.' If they did this, as they might, from force of
habit, they would immediately be marched off to the oasis
and would be 'arrested' by the non-commissioned officers
and marched back to Tokotu, under escort of the Senegalese,
to await court martial. If they did not pile arms, the
non-commissioned officers were to come at once to me, and
we would prepare to sell our lives dearly&mdash;for the
men would mutiny and desert. Possibly a few of the men
would join us, and there was a ghost of a chance that we
might fight our way into the fort and hold it, but it was
infinitely more probable that we should be riddled where we
stood.</p>

<p>"'<i>Bien, mon Commandant,</i>' said Dufour, as he saluted,
and then, hesitatingly, 'Might I presume to make a request
and a suggestion. May I stand by you, and Rastignac stand
by me&mdash;with the muzzle of my revolver against his
liver&mdash;it being clear that, at the slightest threat to
you, Rastignac's digestion is impaired? If he knows that
just this will happen, he also may give good advice to his
friends....'</p>

<p>"'Nothing of the sort, Dufour,' I replied. 'Everything
will proceed normally and properly, until the men
themselves behave abnormally and improperly. We shall lead
and command soldiers of France until we have to fight and
kill, or be killed by, mutineers against the officers of
France in the execution of their duty. Proceed.'</p>

<p>"Would you have said the same, George? It seemed to me
that this idea of the Sergeant-Major's was not much better
than that of waiting for the Senegalese. Would you have
done the same in my place?"</p>

<p>"I can only <i>hope</i> I should have had the courage to
act as bravely and as wisely as you did, Jolly," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am no hero, my friend," smiled de Beaujolais,
"but it seemed the right thing to do. I had not in any way
provoked a mutiny&mdash;indeed, I had stretched a point to
avert it&mdash;and it was my business to go straight ahead,
do my duty, and abide the result.</p>

<p>"But it was with an anxious heart that I mounted the mule
again and cantered over to the fort.</p>

<p>"I had thought of going on a camel, for, it is a strange
psychological fact, that if your hearers have to look
up to you physically, they also have to look up to you
metaphysically as it were. If a leader speaks with more
authority from a mule than from the ground, and with more
weight and power from a horse than from a mule, would he
not speak with still more from a camel?</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;but I felt that I could <i>do</i> more,
somehow, in case of trouble, if I could dash at assailants
with sword and revolver. I am a cavalry man and the <i>arme
blanche</i> is my weapon. Cold steel and cut and thrust,
for me, if I had to go down fighting. You can't charge
and use your sword on a camel, so I compromised on the
mule&mdash;but how I longed for my Arab charger and a few
of my Spahis behind me! It would be a fight then, instead
of a murder....</p>

<p>"It was a weird and not unimpressive scene. That sinister
fort, silver and black; the frozen waves of the ocean of
sand, an illimitable silver sea; the oasis a big, dark
island upon it; the men, statues, inscrutable and still.</p>

<p>"What would they do? Would my next words be my last?
Would a double line of rifles rise and level themselves at
my breast, or would that <i>escouade,</i> upon whom everything
depended, move off like a machine and enter the fort?</p>

<p>"As I faced the men, I was acutely interested, and yet
felt like a spectator, impersonal and unafraid. I was about
to witness a thrilling drama, depicting the fate of one
Henri de Beaujolais, quite probably his death. I hoped he
would play a worthy part on this moonlit stage. I hoped
that, even more than I hoped to see him survive the play. I
was calm. I was detached...."</p>

<p>George Lawrence sighed and struck a match.</p>

<p>"I cast one more look at the glorious moon and took a
deep breath. If this was my last order on parade, it should
be worthily given, in a voice deep, clear, and firm. Above
all firm. And as my mouth opened, and my lower jaw moved in
the act of speech&mdash;I believe it dropped, George, and
my mouth remained open.</p>

<p>"For, from that enigmatical, brooding, fatal
fort&mdash;there shot up a tongue of flame!</p>

<p>"'<i>Mon Dieu! Regardez!</i>' cried the Sergeant-Major,
and pointed. I believe every head turned, and in the
perfect silence I heard him whisper, '<i>Spirits, ghosts,
devils!</i>'</p>

<p>"That brought me to myself sharply. 'Yes, imbecile!' I
said. 'They carry matches and indulge in arson! Quite noted
incendiaries! Where is Rastignac?'</p>

<p>"I asked that because it was perfectly obvious that
someone was in the fort and had set fire to something
highly inflammable. I had been in the place an hour or two
before. There was certainly no sign of fire then, and this
was a sudden rush of flame.</p>

<p>"As I watched, another column of smoke and fire burst
forth in a different place.</p>

<p>"'He is tied up back there, <i>mon Commandant,</i>' replied
Dufour.</p>

<p>"'The forbidden <i>crapaudine?</i>' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I <i>told</i> Corporal Brille to tie him to a tree,' was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Anyhow it could not be Rastignac's work, for he would
not have entered the place, even had he been left at
liberty and had an opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>"'Send and see if he is still there&mdash;and make sure
that everyone else is accounted for,' I ordered.</p>

<p>"It was useless to detail a <i>pompier</i> squad to put the
fire out. We don't have hose and hydrants in the desert,
as you know. When a place burns, it burns. And, <i>mon Dieu,
how</i> it burns in the dry heat of that rainless desert! The
place would be gone, even if the men would enter it, by the
time we had got our teaspoonfuls of water from the oasis.
And, to tell you the truth, I did not care how soon, or how
completely it <i>did</i> go!</p>

<p>"This fire would be the funeral pyre of those brave men.
It would keep my fools from their suicidal mutiny. It would
purge the place of mystery. Incidentally it would save my
life and military reputation, and the new fort that would
arise in its place would not be the haunted, hated prison
that this place would henceforth have been for those who
had to garrison it.</p>

<p>"I gave the order to face about, and then to stand at
ease. The men should watch it burn, since nothing could
be done to save it. Perhaps even they would realise
that human agency is required for setting a building on
fire&mdash;and, moreover, whoever was in there had got to
come out or be cremated. They should see him come.... But
who? Who? The words <i>Who?</i> and <i>Why?</i> filled my mind....</p>

<p>"All stood absolutely silent, spellbound.</p>

<p>"Suddenly the spell was broken and back we came to earth,
at an old familiar sound.</p>

<p>"A rifle cracked, again and again. From the sound the
firing was towards us.</p>

<p>"The Arabs were upon us!</p>

<p>"Far to the right and to the left, more shots were
fired.</p>

<p>"The fort blazing and the Arabs upon us!</p>

<p>"Bullets whistled overhead and I saw one or two flashes
from a distant sand-hill.</p>

<p>"No one was hit, the fort being between us and the
enemy. In less time than it takes to tell I had the men
turned about and making for the oasis&mdash; <i>au pas
gymnastique</i>&mdash;'at the double,' as you call it. There
we should have cover and water, and if we could only hold
the devils until they were nicely between us and St.
Andre's Senegalese, we would avenge the garrison of that
blazing fort.</p>

<p>"They are grand soldiers, those Légionnaires, George. No
better troops in our army. They are to other infantry what
my Spahis are to other cavalry. It warmed one's heart to
see them double, steady as on parade, back to the darkness
of the oasis, every man select his cover and go to ground,
his rifle loaded and levelled as he did so.</p>

<p>"Our camel vedettes rode in soon after. Two of them
had had a desperate fight, and two of them had seen
rifle-flashes and fired at them, before returning to the
oasis, thinking the Arabs had rushed the fort and burnt
it.</p>

<p>"In a few minutes from the first burst of fire, the
whole place was still, silent, and apparently deserted.
Nothing for an enemy to see but a burning fort, and a black
brooding oasis, where nothing moved.</p>

<p>"How I hoped they would swarm yelling round the fort,
thinking to get us like bolted rabbits as we rushed out of
it! It is not like the Arabs to make a night attack, but
doubtless they had been hovering near, and the fire had
brought them down on us.</p>

<p>"Had they seen us outside the fort? If so, they would
attack the oasis in the morning. If they had not seen us,
anything might happen, and the oasis prove a <i>guet-apens,</i>
with the burning or burnt-out fort as the bait of the
trap.</p>

<p>"What were they doing now? The firing had ceased
entirely. Probably making their dispositions to rush us
suddenly at dawn, from behind the nearest sand-hills.
Their game would be to lull us into a sense of security
throughout a peaceful night and come down upon us at
daybreak, like a whirlwind, as we slept.</p>

<p>"And what if our waiting rifles caught them at fifty
yards, and the survivors turned to flee&mdash;on to the
muzzles of those of the Senegalese?...</p>

<p>"It was another impressive scene in that weird drama,
George. A big fire, by moonlight, in the heart of the
Sahara, a fire watched by silent, motionless men,
breathlessly awaiting the arrival of other players on the
stage.</p>

<p>"After gazing into the moonlit distance until my eyes
ached, expecting to see a great band of the blue-veiled
mysterious Silent Ones suddenly swarm over a range of
sand-hills, I bethought me of getting into communication
with St. André.</p>

<p>"I had ordered him to follow by a forced march, leaving
a suitable garrison at Tokotu, when I dashed off with the
'always ready' emergency-detachment on camels, preceding
by an hour or so the 'support' emergency-detachment on
mules, with water, rations, and ammunition.</p>

<p>"These two detachments are more than twice as fast as the
best infantry, but I reckoned that St. André would soon be
drawing near.</p>

<p>"It was quite possible that he might run into the Arabs,
while the latter were watching the oasis&mdash;if they had
seen us enter it, or their skirmishers established the fact
of our presence.</p>

<p>"So far, we had not fired a shot from the oasis, and it
was possible that our presence was unsuspected.</p>

<p>"This might, or might not, be the same band that had
attacked the place. If they were the same, they might be
hanging about in the hope of ambushing a relieving force.
If St. André arrived while the fort was burning, they would
have no chance of catching him unawares. If he came after
the flames had died down, he might march straight into a
trap. There would certainly be a Targui scout or two out in
the direction of Tokotu, while the main body did business
at Zinderneuf.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I must communicate with St. André if possible.
It would be a good man that would undertake the job
successfully&mdash;for both skill and courage would be
required. There was the track to find and follow, and there
were the Arabs to face.</p>

<p>"To lose the former was to die of thirst and starvation;
to find the latter was to die of tortures indescribable.</p>

<p>"On the whole it might be better to send two. Twice the
chance of my message reaching St. André. Possibly more than
twice the chance, really, as two men are braver than one,
because they hearten each other.</p>

<p>"I went round the oasis until I found the Sergeant-Major,
who was going from man to man, prohibiting any firing
without orders, any smoking or the making of any noise.
This was quite sound and I commended him, and then asked
for a couple of men of the right stamp for my job.</p>

<p>"I was not surprised when he suggested two of the men who
had been into the fort with me, and passed the word for
the two Americans. He recommended them as men who could
use the stars, good scouts, brave, resourceful, and very
determined.</p>

<p>"They would, at any rate, stand a chance of getting
through the Arabs and giving St. André the information that
would turn him from their victim into their scourge, if we
had any luck.</p>

<p>"When the big slow giant and the little quick man
appeared and silently saluted, I asked them if they would
like to undertake this duty. They were more than ready, and
as I explained my plans for trapping the Arabs between two
fires, I found them of quick intelligence. Both were able
to repeat to me, with perfect lucidity, what I wanted them
to say to St. André, that he might be able to attack the
attackers at dawn, just when they were attacking me.</p>

<p>"The two left the oasis on camels, from the side opposite
to the fort, and after they had disappeared over a
sand-hill, you may imagine with what anxiety I listened for
firing. But all was silent, and the silence of the grave
prevailed until morning.</p>

<p>"After two or three hours of this unbroken, soundless
stillness, the fire having died down in the fort, I felt
perfectly certain there would be no attack until dawn.</p>

<p>"All who were not on the duty of outposts-by-night
slept, and I strolled silently round and round the oasis,
waiting for the first hint of sunrise and thinking over the
incredible events of that marvellous day&mdash;certainly
unique in my fairly wide experience of hectic days.</p>

<p>"I went over it all again from the moment when I first
sighted the accursed fort with its flag flying over its
unsealed walls and their dead defenders, to the moment when
my eyes refused to believe that the place was on fire and
blazing merrily.</p>

<p>"At length, leaning against the trunk of a palm tree and
longing for a cigarette and some hot coffee to help me
keep awake, I faced the east and watched for the paling of
the stars. As I did so, my mind grew clearer as my body
grew weaker, and I decided to decide that all this was the
work of a madman, concealed in the fort, and now burnt to
death.</p>

<p>"He had, for some reason, murdered the <i>sous-officier</i>
with a bayonet (certainly he must be mad or he would have
shot him); and he had, for some reason, silently killed the
trumpeter and hidden his body&mdash;all in the few minutes
that elapsed before I followed the trumpeter in. (Had the
murderer used <i>another</i> bayonet for this silent job?) He
had for some reason removed the <i>sous-officier's</i>, and the
other man's, body and concealed those too, and, finally, he
had set fire to the fort and perished in the flames.</p>

<p>"But where was he while I searched the place, and why had
he not killed me also when I entered the fort alone?</p>

<p>"The lunacy theory must account for these hopelessly
lunatic proceedings&mdash; but it hardly accounts for the
murdered <i>sous-officier</i> having in his hand a confession
signed, 'Michael Geste,' to the effect that he had stolen a
jewel, does it, my old one?"</p>

<p>"It does <i>not,</i> my son, and that, to me, is the most
interesting and remarkable fact in your most interesting
and remarkable story," replied Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Well, I decided, as I say, to leave it at
that&mdash;just the mad doings of a madman, garnished
by the weird coincidence of the paper," continued de
Beaujolais, "and soon afterwards the sky grew grey in the
east.</p>

<p>"Before a rosy streak could herald the dawn we silently
stood to arms, and when the sun peeped over the horizon
he beheld St. Andre's Senegalese skirmishing beautifully
towards us!</p>

<p>"There wasn't so much as the smell of an Arab
for miles.... No, St. André had not seen a living
thing&mdash;not even the two scouts I had sent out to meet
him. Nor did anyone else ever see those two brave fellows.
I have often wondered what their fate was&mdash;Arabs or
thirst....</p>

<p>"I soon learnt that one of St. Andre's mule-scouts had
ridden back to him, early in the night, to say that he had
heard rifle-shots in the direction of Zinderneuf. St. André
had increased his pace, alternating the quick march and the
<i>pas gymnastique</i> until he knew he must be near his goal.
All being then perfectly silent he decided to beware of an
ambush, to halt for the rest of the night, and to feel his
way forward, in attack formation, at dawn.</p>

<p>"He had done well, and my one regret was that the Arabs
who had caused the destruction of Zinderneuf were not
between me and him as he closed upon the oasis.</p>

<p>"While the weary troops rested, I told St. André all that
had happened, and asked for a theory&mdash;reserving mine
about the madman. He is a man with a brain, this St. André,
ambitious and a real soldier. Although he has private
means, he serves France where duty is hardest, and life
least attractive. A little dark pocket-Hercules of energy
and force.</p>

<p>"'What about this, Major?' said he, when I had finished
my account, and, having fed, we were sitting, leaning our
weary backs against a fallen palm trunk, with coffee and
cigarettes at hand.</p>

<p>"'Suppose your trumpeter killed the <i>sous-officier</i>
himself and deserted there and then?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Mon Dieu!</i>' said I; 'that never occurred to me. But
why should he, and why use his bayonet and leave it in the
body?'</p>

<p>"'Well&mdash;as to why he <i>should,</i>' replied St. André,
'it might have been revenge. This may have been the first
time he had ever been alone with the <i>sous-officier,</i> whom
he may have sworn to kill at the first opportunity.... Some
fancied or real injustice, when he was under this man at
Sidi-bel-Abbès or elsewhere. The sight of his enemy, the
sole survivor, alone, rejoicing in his hour of victory and
triumph, may have further maddened a brain already mad with
<i>cafard,</i> brooding, lust of vengeance, I know not what of
desperation.'</p>

<p>"'Possible,' I said, and thought over this idea. 'But
no, impossible, my friend. Why had not the <i>sous-officier</i>
rushed to the wall, or up to the look-out platform when
I approached! I fired my revolver six times to attract
attention and let them know that relief had come, and two
answering rifle-shots were fired! Why was he not waving his
<i>képi</i> and shouting for joy? Why did he not rush down to
the gates and throw them open?'</p>

<p>"'Wounded and lying down,' suggested St. André.</p>

<p>"'He was not wounded, my friend,' said I. 'He was killed.
That bayonet, and nothing else, had done his business.'</p>

<p>"'Asleep,' suggested the Lieutenant, 'absolutely worn
out. Sleeping like the dead&mdash;and thus his enemy, the
trumpeter, found him, and drove the bayonet through his
heart as he slept. He was going to blow the sleeper's
brains out, when he remembered that the shot would be
heard and would have to be explained. Therefore he used
the bayonet, drove it through the man, and then, and not
till then, he realised that the bayonet would betray him.
It would leap to the eye, instantly, that <i>murder</i> had
been committed&mdash;and not by one of the garrison. So he
fled.'</p>

<p>"'And the revolver, with <i>one</i> chamber fired?' I
asked.</p>

<p>"'Oh&mdash;fired during the battle, at some daring Arab
who rode round the fort, reconnoitring, and came suddenly
into view.'</p>

<p>"'And the paper in the left hand?'</p>

<p>"'I do not know.'</p>

<p>"'And who fired the two welcoming shots?'</p>

<p>"'I do not know.'</p>

<p>"'And how did the trumpeter vanish across the
desert&mdash;as conspicuous as a negro's head on a
pillow&mdash;before the eyes of my Company?'</p>

<p>"'I do not know.'</p>

<p>"'Nor do I,' I said.</p>

<p>"And then St. André sat up suddenly.</p>

<p>"'<i>Mon Commandant,</i>' said he, 'the trumpeter did not
escape, of course. He murdered the <i>sous-officier</i> and then
hid himself. It was he who removed the two bodies when he
again found himself alone in the fort. He may have had some
idea of removing the bayonet and turning the stab into a
bullet-wound. He then meant to return to the Company with
some tale of cock and bull. But remembering that you had
already seen the body, and might have noticed the bayonet,
he determined to set fire to the fort, burn all evidence,
and rejoin in the confusion caused by the fire.</p>

<p>"He could swear that he had been knocked on the head from
behind, and only recovered consciousness in time to escape
from the flames kindled by whoever it was who clubbed him.
This is all feasible&mdash;and if improbable it is no more
improbable than the actual facts of the case, is it?'</p>

<p>"'Quite so, <i>mon Lieutenant,</i>' I agreed. 'And why did
he not rejoin in the confusion, with his tale of cock and
bull?'</p>

<p>"'Well&mdash;here's a theory. Suppose the <i>sous-officier</i>
did shoot at him with the revolver and wounded him so
severely that by the time he had completed his little job
of arson he was too weak to walk. He fainted from loss
of blood and perished miserably in the flames that he
himself had kindled. Truly a splendid example of poetic
justice.'</p>

<p>"'Magnificent,' I agreed. 'The Greek Irony, in effect.
Hoist by his own petard. Victim of the mocking Fates, and
so forth. The only flaw in the beautiful theory is that <i>we
should have heard the shot</i>&mdash;just as we should have
heard a rifle-shot had the trumpeter used his rifle for the
murder. In that brooding heavy silence a revolver fired on
that open roof would have sounded like a seventy-five.'</p>

<p>"'True,' agreed St. André, a little crestfallen. 'The man
was mad then. He did everything that was done, and then
committed suicide or was burnt alive.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, my friend,' said I, 'you have come to the madman
theory, eh? So had I. It is the only one. But now I will
tell you something. The trumpeter did <i>not</i> do all this. He
did <i>not</i> murder the <i>sous-officier,</i> for that unfortunate
had been dead <i>for hours,</i> and the trumpeter had not been
in the place ten <i>minutes!</i>'</p>

<p>"'And that's that,' said St. André. 'Let's try again.'
And he tried again&mdash;very ingeniously too. But he could
put forward no theory that he himself did not at once
ridicule.</p>

<p>"We were both, of course, weary to death and more
in need of twenty-four hours' sleep than twenty-four
conundrums&mdash;but I do not know that I have done much
better since.</p>

<p>"And as I rode back to Tokotu, with my record go of
fever, my head opened with a tearing wrench and closed with
a shattering bang, at every stride of my camel, to the tune
of, '<i>Who killed the Commandant, and why, why, why?</i>' till
I found I was saying it aloud.</p>

<p>"I am saying it still, George."...</p>

<h3>§ 9</h3>

<p class="first">Passengers by the <i>Appam,</i> from Lagos to
Birkenhead, were interested in two friends who sat side by
side in Madeira chairs, or walked the promenade deck in
close and constant company.</p>

<p>The one, a tall, bronzed, lean Englishman, taciturn,
forbidding, and grim, who never used two words where one
would suffice; his cold grey eye looking through, or over,
those who surrounded him; his iron-grey hair and moustache,
his iron-firm chin and mouth, suggesting the iron that had
entered into his soul and made him the hard, cold, bitter
person that he was, lonely, aloof, and self-sufficing.
(Perhaps Lady Brandon of Brandon Abbas, alone of women,
knew the real man and what he might have been; and perhaps
half a dozen men liked him as greatly as all men respected
him.)</p>

<p>The other, a shorter, stouter, more genial person,
socially inclined, a fine type of French soldier, suave,
courtly, and polished, ruddy of face and brown of eye and
hair, and vastly improved by the removal, before Madeira,
of a three years' desert beard. He was obviously much
attached to the Englishman....</p>

<p>It appeared these two had something on their minds, for
day by day, and night by night, save for brief intervals
for eating, sleeping, and playing bridge, they interminably
discussed, or rather the Frenchman interminably discussed,
and the Englishman intently listened, interjecting
monosyllabic replies.</p>

<p>When the Englishman contributed to the one-sided
dialogue, a listener would have noted that he spoke most
often of a bareheaded man and of a paper, speculating as
to the identity of the former and the authorship of the
latter.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, on the other hand, talked more of a
murder, a disappearance, and a fire....</p>

<p>"How long is it since you heard from Lady Brandon,
Jolly?" enquired George Lawrence, one glorious and
invigorating morning, as the <i>Appam</i> ploughed her steady
way across a blue and smiling Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>"Oh, years and years," was the reply. "I was at Brandon
Abbas for a week of my leave before last. That would be
six or seven years ago. I haven't written a line since the
letter of thanks after the visit.... Do you correspond with
her at all regularly?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;no. I shouldn't call it regular correspondence
exactly," answered George Lawrence. "Are you going to
Brandon Abbas this leave?" he continued, with a simulated
yawn.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I feel I ought to go, <i>mon vieux,</i> and take
that incredible document, but it doesn't fit in with my
plans at all. I could post it to her, of course, but it
would mean a devil of a long letter of explanation, and I
loathe letter-writing 'fatigues' more than anything."</p>

<p>"I'll take it if you like," said Lawrence. "I shall be
near Brandon Abbas next week. And knowing Michael Geste, I
confess I am curious."</p>

<p>Major de Beaujolais was conscious of the fact that
"curious" was not exactly the word he would have used.
His self-repressed, taciturn, and unemotional friend had
been stirred to the depths of his soul, and had given an
exhibition of interest and emotion such as he had never
displayed before in all de Beaujolais' experience of
him.</p>

<p>What touched Lady Brandon evidently touched him&mdash;to
an extent that rendered "curious" a curious word to use. He
smiled to himself as he gravely replied:</p>

<p>"But excellent, <i>mon vieux!</i> That would be splendid.
It will save me from writing a letter a mile long, and
Lady Brandon cannot feel that I have treated the <i>affaire</i>
casually, and as if of no importance. I explain the whole
matter to you, her old friend, give you the document,
and ask you to lay it before her. You could say that
while supposing the document to be merely a <i>canard,</i>
interesting only by reason of how and where it was found, I
nevertheless think that she ought to have it, just in case
there is anything I can do in the matter."</p>

<p>"Just that," agreed Lawrence. "Of course 'Beau' Geste
never stole the sapphire, or anything else; but I suppose,
as you say, a document like that ought to go to her and
Geste, as their names are mentioned."</p>

<p>"Certainly, <i>mon ami.</i> And if the stone <i>has</i> been
stolen, the paper might be an invaluable clue to its
recovery. Handwriting, for example, a splendid clue. She
could please herself as to whether she put it in the hands
of your Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland Yard
and asked them to get in touch with our police.... Assure
her of my anxiety to do absolutely anything I can in the
matter&mdash;if either the jewel or Michael Geste should be
missing."</p>

<p>"Righto, Jolly," was the reply. "I'll drop in there one
day. Probably the first person I shall see will be 'Beau'
Geste himself, and probably I shall see the 'Blue Water'
the same evening."</p>

<p>"No doubt, George," agreed de Beaujolais, and added, "Do
you know Michael Geste's handwriting?"</p>

<p>"No. Never saw it to my knowledge," was the reply. "Why
do you ask? You don't suppose that Beau Geste wrote that,
do you?"</p>

<p>"I have given up supposing, my friend," said de
Beaujolais. "But I shall open my next letter from you with
some alacrity. Either this 'Blue Water' is stolen or it is
not. In either case that paper, in a dead man's hand, at
Zinderneuf, is uniquely interesting. But if it <i>has</i> been
stolen, it will be of practical as well as unique interest;
whereas if it has not been stolen, the unique interest will
be merely theoretical."</p>

<p>"Not very practical from the point of view of recovery,
I am afraid. It looks as though the thief and the jewel and
the story all ended together in the burning of Zinderneuf
fort," mused Lawrence.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> I never thought of it before. The biggest
and finest sapphire in the world, valued at three-quarters
of a million francs, may be lying at this moment among the
rubble and rubbish of the burnt-out ruins of Zinderneuf
fort!" said de Beaujolais.</p>

<p>"By Jove! So it may!" agreed Lawrence. "Suppose it has
been stolen.... If I wired to you, could anything be done
about making a search there, do you think?"</p>

<p>For a moment George Lawrence had visions of devoting
his leave to jewel-hunting, and returning to Brandon
Abbas with three-quarters of a million francs' worth of
crystallised alumina in his pocket.</p>

<p>"That will require prompt and careful consideration,
directly we learn that the stone has gone, George," said
de Beaujolais, and added: "This grows more and more
interesting.... A treasure hunt at Zinderneuf! Fancy the
Arabs if the information got about! Fancy the builders
of the new fort, and the garrison! Zinderneuf would
become the most popular outpost in Africa, instead of the
least&mdash;until the sapphire was found. If it <i>is</i> there,
I suppose the surest way to lose it for ever would be to
hint at the fact... No, we should have to keep it very
quiet and do all the searching ourselves, if possible....
Good heavens above us! More complications!" He smiled
whimsically.</p>

<p>George Lawrence pursued his vision and the two fell
silent for a space.</p>

<p>"Supposing that stone had actually been in the pocket
of a man on that roof, when it collapsed into the furnace
below," said de Beaujolais as he sat up and felt for his
cigarette case, "would the jewel be destroyed when the
body of the man was cremated? Does fire affect precious
stones?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," replied Lawrence. "We could find that out
from any jeweller, I suppose. I rather think not. Aren't
they, in fact, formed in the earth by a heat greater than
any furnace can produce?"</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed de Beaujolais. "You could make as
many diamonds as you wanted if you could get sufficient
heat and pressure. They are only crystallised carbon. Fire
certainly wouldn't hurt a diamond, and I don't suppose it
would hurt any other precious stone."</p>

<p>"No," he mused on. "If the Blue Water has been stolen,
it is probably safe and sound at this moment in Zinderneuf,
adorning the charred remains of a skeleton"... and George
Lawrence day-dreamed awhile, of himself, Lady Brandon,
and the sacrifice of his leave to the making of a great
restoration. Of his leave? Nay, if necessary, of his
career, his whole life.</p>

<p>("Describe me a man's day-dreams and I will describe you
the man," said the Philosopher. He might have described
George Lawrence as a romantic and quixotic fool-errant,
which he was not, or perhaps merely as a man in love, which
he was. Possibly the Philosopher might have added that the
descriptions are synonymous, and that therefore George
Lawrence was both.)</p>

<p>He was awakened from his reverie by the voice of de
Beaujolais.</p>

<p>"Queer, that it never got into the papers, George,"
mused that gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is," agreed Lawrence. "I should certainly have
seen it if it had. I read my <i>Telegraph</i> and <i>Observer</i>
religiously.... No, I certainly should never have missed
it.... Probably the damned thing was never stolen at
all."</p>

<p>"Looks like it," said his friend. "Every English paper
would have had an account of the theft of a famous jewel
like that.... Though it is just possible that Lady Brandon
hushed it up for some reason.... What about an <i>aperitif,</i>
my old one!"</p>

<p>And, his old one agreeing, they once more dropped the
subject of Beau Geste, the "Blue Water," Zinderneuf, and
its secret.</p>

<p>On parting in London, Major de Beaujolais handed a
document to George Lawrence, who promised to deliver it,
and also to keep his friend informed as to any developments
of the story.</p>

<p>The Major felt that he had the middle of it, and he
particularly desired to discover its beginning, and to
follow it to the end.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch102" id="ch102">II</a>. &mdash; GEORGE
LAWRENCE TAKES THE STORY<br> TO LADY BRANDON AT BRANDON
ABBAS</h2>

<p class="first">AS his hireling car sped along the country
road that led to the park gates of Brandon Abbas, George
Lawrence's heart beat like that of a boy going to his first
love-tryst.</p>

<p>Had she married him, a quarter of a century ago, when
she was plain (but very beautiful) Patricia Rivers, he
probably would still have loved her, though he would not
have been in love with her.</p>

<p>As it was he had never been anything but in love with
her from the time when he had taken her refusal like the
man he was, and had sought an outlet and an anodyne in work
and Central Africa.</p>

<p>As the car entered the gates and swept up the long,
winding avenue of Norman oaks, he actually trembled, and
his bronzed face was drawn and changed in tint. He drew off
a glove and put it on again, fingered his tie, and tugged
at his moustache.</p>

<p>The car swept round a shrubbery-enclosed square at
the back of the house, and stopped at a big porch and a
hospitably open door. Standing at this, Lawrence looked
into a well-remembered panelled hall and ran his eye over
its gleaming floor and walls, almost nodding to the two
suits of armour that stood one on each side of a big,
doorless doorway. This led into another hall, from, and
round, which ran a wide staircase and galleries right up
to the top of the house, for, from the floor of that hall
one could look up to a glass roof three stories above. He
pictured it and past scenes enacted in it, and a woman with
slow and stately grace, ascending and descending.</p>

<p>Nothing seemed to have changed in those two and a half
decades since she had come here, a bride, and he had
visited her after seven years of exile. He had come, half
in the hope that the sight of her in her own home, the wife
of another man, would cure him of the foolish love that
kept him a lonely bachelor, half in the hope that it would
do the opposite, and be but a renewal of love.</p>

<p>He had been perversely glad to find that he loved the
woman, if possible, more than he had loved the girl; that a
callow boy's calf-love for a maiden had changed to a young
man's devotion to a glorious woman; that she was to be a
second Dante's Beatrice.</p>

<p>Again and again, at intervals of years, he had visited
the shrine, not so much renewing the ever-burning fire
at her altar, as watching it flame up brightly in her
presence. Nor did the fact that she regarded him so much as
friend that he could never be more, nor less, in any way
affect this undeviating unprofitable sentiment.</p>

<p>At thirty, at thirty-five, at forty, at forty-five, he
found that his love, if not unchanged, was not diminished,
and that she remained, what she had been since their first
meeting, the central fact of his life&mdash;not so much an
obsession, an <i>idée fixe,</i> as his reason for existence, his
sovereign, and the audience of the play in the theatre of
his life.</p>

<p>And, each time he saw her, she was, to his prejudiced
eye, more desirable, more beautiful, more wonderful....</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;there was the fifteenth-century chest in which
reposed croquet mallets, tennis rackets, and the other
paraphernalia of those games. She had once sat on that
old chest, beside him, while they waited for the dog-cart
to take him to the station and back to Africa, and her
hand had rested so kindly in his, as he had tried to find
something to say&mdash;something other than what he might
not say....</p>

<p>Opposite to it was the muniment-box, into which many an
abbot and holy friar had put many a lead-sealed parchment.
It would be full of garden rugs and cushions. On that,
she had sat beside him, after his dance with her, one New
Year's Eve....</p>

<p>Same pictures of horse and hound, and bird and beast;
same antlers and foxes' masks and brushes; same trophies
he had sent from Nigeria, specially good heads of lion,
buffalo, gwambaza, and gazelle.</p>

<p>From these his eye travelled to the great fire-place, on
each side of which stood a mounted Lake Tchad elephant's
foot, doing menial service, while above its stone mantel, a
fine trophy of African weapons gleamed. One of his greatest
satisfactions had always been to acquire something worthy
to be sent to Brandon Abbas&mdash;to give her pleasure and
to keep him in mind.</p>

<p>And now, perhaps, was his real chance of giving her
pleasure and keeping himself, for a space, very much in her
mind. He pulled the quaint old handle of a chain, and a
distant bell clanged.</p>

<p>A footman approached, a stranger.</p>

<p>He would enquire as to whether her ladyship were at
home. But as he turned to go, the butler appeared in the
doorway from the inner hall.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Burdon! How are you?" said Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. George, sir!" replied the old man, who had
known Lawrence for thirty years, coming forward and looking
unwontedly human.</p>

<p>"This is a real pleasure, sir."</p>

<p>It was&mdash;a real five-pound note too, when the
visitor, a perfect gent, departed. Quite a source of income
Mr. Lawrence had been, ever since Henry Burdon had been
under-footman in the service of her ladyship's father.</p>

<p>"Her Ladyship is at the Bower, sir, if you'd like to
come straight out," he continued, knowing that the visitor
was a very old friend indeed, and always welcome. "I will
announce you."</p>

<p>Burdon led the way.</p>

<p>"How is Lady Brandon?" enquired Lawrence, impelled to
unwonted loquacity by his nervousness.</p>

<p>"She enjoys very good health, sir&mdash;considering,"
replied the butler.</p>

<p>"Considering what?" asked Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Everythink, sir," was the non-committal reply.</p>

<p>The visitor smiled to himself. A good servant, this.</p>

<p>"And how is his Reverence?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Queer, sir, very. And gets queerer, poor gentleman,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>Lawrence expressed regret at this bad news concerning
the chaplain, as the Reverend Maurice Ffolliot was always
called in that house.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Michael here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir, he ain't. Nor none of the other young
gentlemen," was the reply. Was there anything unusual in
the old man's tone?...</p>

<p>Emerging from the shrubbery, crossing a rose-garden,
some lawn-tennis courts, and a daisy-pied stretch of
cedar-studded sward, the pair entered a wood, followed a
path beneath enormous elms and beeches, and came out on to
a square of velvet turf.</p>

<p>On two sides, the left and rear, rose the great old
trees of a thickly forested hill; on the right, the grey
old house; and from the front of this open space the
hillside fell away to the famous view.</p>

<p>By wicker table and hammock-stand, a lady reclined in a
<i>chaise longue.</i> She was reading a book and her back was
towards Lawrence, whose heart missed a beat and hastened to
make up for the omission by a redoubled speed.</p>

<p>The butler coughed at the right distance and upon the
right note, and, as Lady Brandon turned, announced the
visitor, hovered, placed a wicker chair, and faded from the
scene.</p>

<p>"<i>George!</i>" said Lady Brandon, in her soft deep
contralto, with a pleased brightening of her wide grey
eyes and flash of beautiful teeth. But she did not flush
nor pale, and there was no quickening of her breathing.
It was upon the man that these symptoms were produced by
the meeting, although it was a meeting anticipated by him,
unexpected by her.</p>

<p>"<i>Patricia!</i>" he said, and extended both hands. She
took them frankly and Lawrence kissed them both, with a
curiously gentle and reverent manner, an exhibition of a
George Lawrence unknown to other people.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear!" he said, and looked long at the
unlined, if mature, determined, clever face before
him&mdash;that of a woman of forty years, of strong
character and of aristocratic breeding.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued.</p>

<p>"Yes 'what,' George?" asked Lady Brandon.</p>

<p>"Yes. You are positively as young and as beautiful as
ever," he replied&mdash; but with no air of gallantry and
compliment, and rather as a sober statement of ascertained
fact.</p>

<p>"And you as foolish, George.... Sit down&mdash;and tell
me why you have disobeyed me and come here before your
wedding.... Or&mdash;or&mdash;are you married, George!" was
the smiling reply.</p>

<p>"No, Patricia, I am not married," said Lawrence,
relinquishing her hands slowly. "And I have disobeyed you,
and come here again without bringing a wife, because I
hoped you might be in need of my help.... I mean, I feared
you might be in trouble and in need of help, and hoped that
I might be able to give it."</p>

<p>Lady Brandon fixed a penetrating gaze on Lawrence's
face&mdash;neither startled nor alarmed, he felt, but
keen and, possibly, to be described as wary, or at least
watchful.</p>

<p>"Trouble? In need of help, George? How!" she asked, and
whatever of wariness or watchfulness had peeped from her
eyes retired, and her face became a beautiful mask, showing
no more than reposeful and faintly-amused interest.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it is a longish story," said Lawrence.
"But I need not inflict it on you if you'll tell me
if Beau Geste is all right and&mdash;er&mdash;the
'Blue Water'&mdash; er&mdash;safe and sound
and&mdash;er&mdash;all that, you know."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" ejaculated his hearer sharply.</p>

<p>There was no possible doubt now, as to the significance
of the look on Lady Brandon's face. It certainly could be
called one of alarm, and her direct gaze was distinctly
watchful and wary. Had not she also paled very slightly?
Undoubtedly she frowned faintly as she asked:</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you talking about, George?"</p>

<p>"Beau Geste, and the 'Blue Water,' Patricia,"
replied Lawrence. "If I appear to be talking through my
hat, I am not really, and will produce reason for my
wild-but-not-wicked words," he laughed. "There is method in
my madness, dear."</p>

<p>"There's madness in your method," replied Lady Brandon a
trifle tartly, and added: "Have you seen Michael, then? Or
what? Tell me!"</p>

<p>"No. I have not seen him&mdash;but..."</p>

<p>"Then <i>what</i> are you talking about? What do you know!"
she interrupted, speaking hurriedly, a very sure sign that
she was greatly perturbed.</p>

<p>"I don't <i>know</i> anything, Patricia, and I'm asking
<i>you,</i> because I have, most extraordinarily, come into
possession of a document that purports to be a confession
by Beau that he stole the 'Blue Water,'" began Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Then it <i>was</i>..." whispered Lady Brandon.</p>

<p>"Was what, Patricia?" asked Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Go on, dear," she replied hastily. "How and where did
you get this confession? Tell me quickly."</p>

<p>"As I said, it's a long story," replied Lawrence. "It
was found by de Beaujolais at a place called Zinderneuf in
the French Soudan, in the hand of a dead man..."</p>

<p>"Not <i>Michael!</i>" interrupted Lady Brandon.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;a Frenchman. An <i>adjudant</i> in charge of a fort
that had been attacked by Arabs..."</p>

<p>"<i>Our</i> Henri de Beaujolais?" interrupted Lady Brandon,
again. "Who was at school with you?... Rose Cary's son?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He found it in this dead officer's hand..."
replied Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;<i>has</i> the sapphire been stolen, Patricia,
and&mdash;er&mdash;excuse the silly question&mdash;is this
Beau's writing?" and he thrust his hand into the inner
pocket of his jacket.</p>

<p>"But of course it isn't," he continued as he produced
an envelope and extracted a stained and dirty piece of
paper.</p>

<p>Lady Brandon took the latter and looked at it, her face
hard, enigmatical, a puzzled frown marring the smoothness
of her forehead, her firm shapely mouth more tightly
compressed than usual.</p>

<p>She read the document and then looked out into the
distance, down the coombe, and across the green and smiling
plain, as though communing with herself and deciding how to
answer.</p>

<p>"Tell me the whole story from beginning to end, George,"
she said at length, "if it takes you the week-end. But tell
me this quickly. <i>Do</i> you know anything more than you have
told me, about either Michael or the 'Blue Water'?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing whatever, my dear," was the reply, and
the speaker thought he saw a look of relief, or a lessening
of the look of alarm on his hearer's face, "but what I have
told you. You know as much as I do now&mdash;except the
details, of course."</p>

<p>George Lawrence noted that Lady Brandon had neither
admitted nor denied that the sapphire had been stolen, had
neither admitted nor denied that the handwriting was that
of her nephew.</p>

<p>Obviously and undoubtedly there was something wrong,
something queer, and in connection with Beau Geste too.</p>

<p>For one thing, he was missing and she did not know where
he was.</p>

<p>But since all questions as to him, his handwriting, and
the safety of the jewel had remained unanswered, he could
only refrain from repeating them, and do nothing more but
tell his story, and, at the end of it, say: "If the 'Blue
Water' is not in this house, Patricia, I am going straight
to Zinderneuf to find it for you."</p>

<p>She would then, naturally, give him all the information
she could, and every assistance in her power&mdash;if the
sapphire had been stolen.</p>

<p>If it had not, she would, of course, say so.</p>

<p>But he wished she would be a little less guarded, a
little more communicative. It would be so very easy to say:
"My dear George, the 'Blue Water' is in the safe in the
Priests' Hole as usual, and Michael is in excellent health
and spirits," or, on the other hand, to admit at once: "The
'Blue Water' has vanished and so has Michael."</p>

<p>However, what Patricia Brandon did was right. For
whatever course of action she pursued, she had some
excellent reason, and he had no earthly cause to feel a
little hurt at her reticence in the matter.</p>

<p>For example, if the impossible had come to pass, and
Beau Geste had stolen the sapphire and bolted, would it not
be perfectly natural for her to feel most reluctant to have
it known that her nephew was a thief&mdash;a despicable
creature that robbed his benefactress?</p>

<p>Of course. She would even shield him, very
probably&mdash;to such an extent as was compatible with the
recovery of the jewel.</p>

<p>Or if she were so angry, contemptuous, disgusted, as to
feel no inclination to shield him, she would at any rate
regard the affair as a disgraceful family scandal, about
which the less said the better. Quite so.</p>

<p>But to <i>him,</i> who had unswervingly loved her from his
boyhood, and whom she frequently called her best friend,
the man to whom she would always turn for help, since the
pleasure of helping her was the greatest pleasure he could
have? Why be reticent, guarded, and uncommunicative to
him?</p>

<p>But&mdash;her pleasure was her pleasure, and his was to
serve it in any way she deigned to indicate....</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have the details, dear, and tea as well,"
said Lady Brandon more lightly and easily than she had
spoken since he had mentioned the sapphire.</p>

<p>"We'll have it in my boudoir, and I'll be at home to
nobody whomsoever. You shall just talk until it is time to
dress for dinner, and tell me every least detail as you go
along. Everything you think, too; everything that Henri
de Beaujolais thought;&mdash;and everything you think he
thought, as well."</p>

<p>As they strolled back to the house, Lady Brandon slipped
her hand through Lawrence's arm, and it was quickly
imprisoned.</p>

<p>He glowed with the delightful feeling that this brave
and strong woman (whose devoted love for another man was,
now, at any rate, almost maternal in its protecting care),
was glad to turn to him as others turned to her.</p>

<p>How he yearned to hear her say, when his tale was
told:</p>

<p>"Help me, George. I have no one but you, and you are a
tower of strength. I am in great trouble."</p>

<p>"You aren't looking too well, George, my dear," she
said, as they entered the wood.</p>

<p>"Lot of fever lately," he replied, and added: "I feel as
fit as six people <i>now,</i>" and pressed the hand that he had
seized.</p>

<p>"Give it up and come home, George," said Lady Brandon,
and he turned quickly toward her, his eyes opening widely.
"And let me find you a wife," she continued.</p>

<p>Lawrence sighed and ignored the suggestion.</p>

<p>"How is Ffolliot?" he asked instead.</p>

<p>"Perfectly well, thank you. Why shouldn't he be?" was
the reply&mdash;in the tone of which a careful listener,
such as George Lawrence, might have detected a note of
defensiveness, almost of annoyance, of repudiation of an
unwarrantable implication.</p>

<p>If Lawrence did detect it, he ignored this also.</p>

<p>"Where is the good Sir Hector Brandon?" he asked, with
casual politeness.</p>

<p>"Oh, in Thibet, or Paris, or East Africa, or Monte
Carlo, or the South Sea Islands, or Homburg. Actually
Kashmir, I believe, thank you, George," replied Lady
Brandon, and added: "Have you brought a suit-case or must
you wire?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;am staying at the Brandon Arms, and
have one there," admitted Lawrence.</p>

<p>"And how long have you been at the Brandon Arms,
George?" she enquired.</p>

<p>"Five minutes," he answered.</p>

<p>"You must be tired of it then, dear," commented Lady
Brandon, and added: "I'll send Robert down for your
things."</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">That evening, George Lawrence told Lady
Brandon all that Major de Beaujolais had told him, adding
his own ideas, suggestions, and theories. But whereas the
soldier had been concerned with the inexplicable events of
the day, Lawrence was concerned with the inexplicable paper
and the means by which it had reached the hand of a dead
man, on the roof of a desert outpost in the Sahara.</p>

<p>Throughout his telling of the tale, Lady Brandon
maintained an unbroken silence, but her eyes scarcely left
his face.</p>

<p>At the end she asked a few questions, but offered no
opinion, propounded no theory.</p>

<p>"We'll talk about it after dinner, George," she said.</p>

<p>And after a poignantly delightful dinner <i>à
deux</i>&mdash;it being explained that the Reverend Maurice
Ffolliot was dining in his room to-night, owing to a
headache&mdash;George Lawrence found that the talking was
again to be done by him. All that Lady Brandon contributed
to the conversation was questions. Again she offered no
opinion, propounded no theory.</p>

<p>Nor, as Lawrence reluctantly admitted to himself, when
he lay awake in bed that night, did she once admit, nor
even imply, that the "Blue Water" had been stolen. His
scrupulous care to avoid questioning her on the subject of
the whereabouts of the sapphire and of her nephew, Michael
Geste, made this easy for her, and she had availed herself
of it to the full. The slightly painful realisation, that
she now knew all that he did whereas he knew nothing from
her, could not be denied.</p>

<p>Again and again it entered his mind and roused the
question, "<i>Why</i> cannot she confide in me, and at least say
whether the sapphire has been stolen or not?"</p>

<p>Again and again he silenced it with the loyal reply,
"For some excellent reason.... Whatever she does is
right."</p>

<p>After breakfast next day, Lady Brandon took him for a
long drive. That the subject which now obsessed him (as
it had, in a different way and for a different reason,
obsessed de Beaujolais) was also occupying her mind, was
demonstrated by the fact that, from time to time, and à
propos of nothing in particular, she would suddenly ask him
some fresh question bearing on the secret of the tragedy of
Zinderneuf.</p>

<p>How he restrained himself from saying, "Where is
Michael? <i>Has</i> anything happened? <i>Is</i> the 'Blue Water'
stolen?" he did not know. A hundred times, one or the
other of these questions had leapt from his brain to
the tip of his tongue, since the moment when, at their
first interview, he had seen that she wished to make no
communication or statement whatever.</p>

<p>As the carriage turned in at the park gates on their
return, he laid his hand on hers and said:</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;I think everything has now been said,
except one thing&mdash;your instructions to me. All I want
now is to be told exactly what you want me to do."</p>

<p>"I will tell you that, George, when you go.... And
<i>thank</i> you, my dear," replied Lady Brandon.</p>

<p>So he possessed his soul in patience until the hour
struck.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">"Come and rest on this chest a moment,
Patricia," he said, on taking his departure next day, when
she had telephoned to the garage, "to give me my orders.
You are going to make me happier than I have been since you
told me that you liked me too much to love me."</p>

<p>Lady Brandon seated herself beside Lawrence and all but
loved him for his chivalrous devotion, his unselfishness,
his gentle strength, and utter trustworthiness.</p>

<p>"We have sat here before, George," she said, smiling,
and, as he took her hand:</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear. This is what I want you to do for
me. Just <i>nothing at all.</i> The 'Blue Water' is not at
Zinderneuf, nor anywhere else in Africa. Where Michael is
I do not know. What that paper means, I cannot tell. And
thank you so much for wanting to help me, and for asking no
questions. And now, good-bye, my dear, dear friend...."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dearest dear," said George Lawrence, most
sorely puzzled, and went out to the door a sadder but not a
wiser man.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">As the car drove away, Lady Brandon stood
in deep thought, pinching her lip.</p>

<p>"To think of that now!" she said.... "'Be sure your
sins.'... The world <i>is</i> a very small place..." and went in
search of the Reverend Maurice Ffolliot.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">In regard to this same gentleman, George
Lawrence entertained feelings which were undeniably
mixed.</p>

<p>As a just and honest man, he recognised that
the Reverend Maurice Ffolliot was a gentle-souled,
sweet-natured, lovable creature, a finished scholar, a
polished and cultured gentleman who had never intentionally
harmed a living creature.</p>

<p>As the jealous, lifelong admirer and devotee of Lady
Brandon, the rejected but undiminished lover, he knew that
he hated not so much Ffolliot himself, as the fact of his
existence.</p>

<p>Irrationally, George Lawrence felt that Lady Brandon
would long outlive that notorious evil-liver, her husband.
But for Ffolliot, he believed, his unswerving faithful
devotion would then get its reward. Not wholly selfishly,
he considered that a truer helpmeet, a sturdier prop,
a stouter shield and buckler for this lady of many
responsibilities, would be the world-worn and experienced
George Lawrence, rather than this poor frail recluse of a
chaplain.</p>

<p>Concerning the man's history, all he knew was, that he
had been the curate, well-born but penniless, to whom Lady
Brandon's father had presented the living which was in his
gift. With the beautiful Patricia Rivers, Ffolliot had
fallen disastrously and hopelessly in love.</p>

<p>Toward the young man, Patricia Rivers had entertained
a sentiment of affection, compounded more of pity than of
love.</p>

<p>Under parental pressure, assisted by training and
comparative poverty, ambition had triumphed over affection,
and the girl, after some refusals, had married wealthy Sir
Hector Brandon.</p>

<p>Later, and too late, she had realised the abysmal gulf
that must lie between life with a selfish, heartless,
gross roué, and that with such a man as the companion of
her youth, with whom she had worked and played and whose
cleverness, learning, sweet nature, and noble unselfishness
she now realised.</p>

<p>Lawrence was aware that Lady Brandon fully believed that
the almost fatal nervous breakdown which utterly changed
Ffolliot in body and mind, was the direct result of her
worldly and loveless marriage with a mean and vicious man.
In this belief she had swooped down upon the poor lodgings
where Ffolliot lay at death's door, wrecked in body and
unhinged of mind, and brought him back with her to Brandon
Abbas as soon as he could be moved. From there he had never
gone&mdash;not for a single day, nor a single hour.</p>

<p>When he recovered, he was installed as chaplain, and as
"the Chaplain" he had been known ever since.</p>

<p>Almost reluctantly, George Lawrence admitted that most
of what was good, simple, kind, and happy in that house
emanated from this gentle presence....</p>

<p>Pacing the little platform of the wayside station, it
occurred to George Lawrence to wonder if he might have more
to tell the puzzled de Beaujolais had his visit to Brandon
Abbas included the privilege, if not the pleasure, of a
conversation with the Reverend Maurice Ffolliot.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="part2" id="part2">PART II</a> &mdash; THE
MYSTERY OF THE "BLUE WATER"</h2>

<h2><a name="ch201" id="ch201">I</a>. &mdash; BEAU GESTE
AND HIS BAND</h2>

<p class="first">"I THINK, perhaps, that if Very Small
Geste were allowed to live, he might retrieve his character
and find a hero's grave," said the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"And what would he do if he found a hero's grave?"
enquired the Captain.</p>

<p>"Pinch the flowers off it and sell them, I suppose. As
for retrieving his character, it is better not retrieved.
Better left where it is&mdash;if it is not near inhabited
houses, or water used for drinking purposes..."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>please</i> let him live," interrupted Faithful Hound.
"He is very useful at times, if only to try things on."</p>

<p>I was very grateful to Faithful Hound for daring to
intercede for me, but felt that she was rating my general
usefulness somewhat low.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll try bread and water on him, then," said the
Captain after a pause, during which I suffered many things.
"We'll also try a flogging," he added, on seeing my face
brighten, "and the name of Feeble Geste.... Remove it."</p>

<p>And I was removed by the Lieutenant, Ghastly Gustus,
and Queen Claudia, that the law might take its course. It
took it, while Faithful Hound wept apart and Queen Claudia
watched with deep interest.</p>

<p>I used to dislike the slice of bread and the water,
always provided for these occasions, even more than the
"six of the best," which was the flogging administered,
more in sorrow than in anger, by the Captain himself.</p>

<p>The opprobrious name only lasted for the day upon which
it was awarded, but was perhaps the worst feature of a
punishment. The others passed and were gone, but the name
kept one in the state of unblessedness, disgraced and
outcast. Nor was one allowed in any way to retaliate upon
the user of the injurious epithet, awarded in punishment
after formal trial, however inferior and despicable
he might be. One had to answer to it promptly, if not
cheerfully, or far worse would befall.</p>

<p>This was part of the Law as laid down by the Captain,
and beneath his Law we lived, and strove to live worthily,
for we desired his praise and rewards more than we feared
his blame and punishments.</p>

<p>The Captain was my brother, Michael Geste, later
and generally known as "Beau" Geste, by reason of his
remarkable physical beauty, mental brilliance, and general
distinction. He was a very unusual person, of irresistible
charm, and his charm was enhanced, to me at any rate,
by the fact that he was as enigmatic, incalculable, and
incomprehensible as he was forceful. He was incurably
romantic, and to this trait added the unexpected quality of
a bull-dog tenacity. If Michael suddenly and quixotically
did some ridiculously romantic thing, he did it thoroughly
and completely, and he stuck to it until it was done.</p>

<p>Aunt Patricia, whose great favourite he was, said that
he combined the inconsequent romanticism and reckless
courage of a youthful d'Artagnan with the staunch tenacity
and stubborn determination of a wise old Scotchman!</p>

<p>Little wonder that he exercised an extraordinary
fascination over those who lived with him.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant, my brother Digby, was his twin, a
quarter of an hour his junior, and his devoted and
worshipping shadow. Digby had all Michael's qualities, but
to a less marked degree, and he was "easier," both upon
himself and other people, than Michael was. He loved fun
and laughter, jokes and jollity, and, above all, he loved
doing what Michael did.</p>

<p>I was a year younger than these twins, and very much
their obedient servant. At preparatory school we were
known as Geste, Small Geste, and Very Small Geste, and I
was, indeed, Very Small in all things, compared with my
brilliant brothers, to please whom was my chief aim in
life.</p>

<p>Probably I transferred to them the affection, obedience,
and love-hunger that would have been given to my parents
in the ordinary course of events; but we were orphans,
remembered not our mother nor our father, and lived our
youthful lives between school and Brandon Abbas, as soon as
we emerged from the Chaplain's tutelage.</p>

<p>Our maternal aunt, Lady Brandon, did more than her duty
by us, but certainly concealed any love she may have felt
for any of us but Michael.</p>

<p>Childless herself, I think all the maternal love she had
to spare was given to him and Claudia, an extraordinarily
beautiful girl whose origin was, so far as we were
concerned, mysterious, but who was vaguely referred to
as a cousin. She and a niece of Aunt Patricia, named
Isobel Rivers, also spent a good deal of their childhood
at Brandon Abbas, Isobel being, I think, imported as a
playmate and companion for Claudia when we were at school.
She proved an excellent playmate and companion for us also,
and, at an early date, earned and adorned the honorary
degree and honourable title of Faithful Hound.</p>

<p>A frequent visitor, Augustus Brandon, nephew of Sir
Hector Brandon, often came during our holidays, in spite of
the discouragement of the permanent name of Ghastly Gustus
and our united and undisguised disapproval.</p>

<p>One could not love Augustus; he was far too like Uncle
Hector for one thing, and, for another, he was too certain
he was the heir and too disposed to presume upon it.
However, Michael dealt with him faithfully, neither sparing
the rod nor spoiling the child....</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">I do not remember the precise crime that
had led to my trial and sentence, but I recollect the
incident clearly enough, for two reasons.</p>

<p>One was that, on this very day of my fall from grace, I
achieved the permanent and inalienable title and status of
Stout Fella, when, inverting the usual order of precedence,
Pride came after the Fall. The other reason was that, on
that evening, we had the exciting privilege of seeing and
handling the "Blue Water," as it is called, the great
sapphire which Uncle Hector had given to Aunt Patricia as
a wedding gift. I believe his great-grandfather, "Wicked
Brandon," had "acquired" it when soldiering against Dupleix
in India.</p>

<p>It is about the loveliest and most fascinating thing
I have ever seen, and it always affected me strangely. I
could look at it for hours, and it always gave me a curious
longing to put it in my mouth, or crush it to my breast, to
hold it to my nose like a flower, or to rub it against my
ear.</p>

<p>To look at it was, at one and the same time, most
satisfying and most tantalising, for one always longed to
do more than merely look&mdash;and, moreover, more than
merely touch, as well. So wonderful and beautiful an object
seemed to demand the exercise of all five senses, instead
of one or two, for the full appreciation of all the joy it
could offer.</p>

<p>When I first heard the charitable remark, "Sir Hector
Brandon bought Patricia Rivers with the 'Blue Water' and
now owns the pair," I felt that both statements were
true.</p>

<p>For what other reason could a woman like Aunt Patricia
have married Uncle Hector, and did not he still own
the "Blue Water"&mdash;and so retain his sole claim to
distinction?</p>

<p>Certainly his wife did not own it, for she could not
wear it, nor do anything else with it. She could merely
look at it occasionally, like anybody else. That was
something anyhow, if it affected her as it did me....</p>

<p>My degree of S.F. (Stout Fella) I earned in this wise.
One of Michael's favourite and most thrilling pastimes
was "Naval Engagements." When this delightful pursuit was
in being, two stately ships, with sails set and rudders
fixed, were simultaneously shoved forth from the concrete
edge of the lily-pond, by the Captain and the Lieutenant
respectively.</p>

<p>They were crowded with lead soldiers, bore each a
battery of three brass cannon, and were, at the outset,
about a yard apart. But to each loaded brass cannon was
attached a fuse, and, at the Captain's word, the fuses were
lighted as the ships were launched from their harbours.</p>

<p>The Captain presided over the destinies of the ship that
flew the White Ensign and Union Jack, and the Lieutenant
over those of the one that carried the Tri-couleur of
France.</p>

<p>There was a glorious uncertainty of result. Each ship
might receive a broadside from the other, one alone might
suffer, or both might blaze ineffectually into the blue,
by reason of a deviation of their courses. After the
broadsides had been exchanged, we all sat and gloated upon
the attractive scene, as the ships glided on, wreathed in
battle-smoke, perhaps with riddled sails and splintered
hulls (on one memorable and delightful occasion with the
French ship dismasted and the Tri-couleur trailing in the
water).</p>

<p>I was then privileged to wade, like Gulliver at
Lilliput, into the deep, and bring the ships to harbour
where their guns were reloaded by Michael and Digby, and
the voyage repeated....</p>

<p>On this great day, the first combat was ideal.
The ships converged, the guns of both fired almost
simultaneously, splinters flew, soldiers fell or were
sent flying overboard, the ships rocked to the explosions
and concussion of the shot, and then drifted together
and remained locked in a death-grapple to the shouts of
"Boarders ready" and "Prepare to receive boarders," from
the Captain and Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Fetch 'em in, Feeble Geste," said Michael, imagination
sated, and tucking up my trousers, I waded in, reversed the
ships, and sent them to port.</p>

<p>The next round was more one-sided, for only one of the
French ship's guns fired, and that, the feeblest. Neither
the big gun amidships, that carried either a buckshot or
half a dozen number-sixes, nor the stern-chaser swivel-gun
was properly fused.</p>

<p>I waded in again, turned the French ship, and, with a
mighty bang, her big gun went off, and I took the charge in
my leg. Luckily for me it was a single buckshot. I nearly
sat down.</p>

<p>"I'm shot," I yelped.</p>

<p>"Hanging would be more appropriate," said the Captain.
"Come here."</p>

<p>Blood oozed from a neat blue hole, and Faithful Hound
uttered a dog-like howl of woe and horror.</p>

<p>Claudia asked to be informed exactly how it felt.</p>

<p>"Just like being shot," I replied, and added: "I am
going to be sick."</p>

<p>"Do it in the pond then," requested the Captain,
producing his pocket-knife and a box of matches.</p>

<p>"Going to cauterise the wound and prevent its turning
sceptic?" enquired the Lieutenant, as the Captain struck
a match, and held the point of the small blade in the
flame.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Captain. "Naval surgery without
aesthetics.... Cut out the cannon-ball."</p>

<p>"Now," continued he, turning to me as I sat wondering
whether I should shortly have a wooden leg, "will you be
gagged or chew on a bullet? I don't want to be disturbed by
your beastly yells."</p>

<p>"I shall not yell, Captain," I replied with dignity, and
a faint hope that I spoke the truth.</p>

<p>"Sit on his head, Dig," said Michael to the Lieutenant;
but waving Digby away, I turned on my side, shut my eyes,
and offered up my limb.</p>

<p>"Hold his hoof then," ordered the Captain....</p>

<p>It was painful beyond words; but I contrived to hold my
peace, by biting the clenched knuckle of my forefinger,
and to refrain from kicking by realising that it was
impossible, with Digby sitting on my leg and Claudia
standing on my foot.</p>

<p>After what seemed a much longer time than it was, I
heard Michael say, apparently from a long way off: "Here it
comes," and then, a cheer from the Band and a dispersal of
my torturers, announced the recovery of the buckshot.</p>

<p>"Shove it back in the gun, Dig," said the Captain; "and
you, Isobel, sneak up to the cupboard outside our bathroom
and bring me the scratch-muck."</p>

<p>The Faithful Hound, mopping her tear-bedewed face, sped
away and soon returned with the scratch-muck (the bottle
of antiseptic lotion, packet of boric lint, and roll of
bandage, which figured as the <i>sequelæ</i> to all our minor
casualties).</p>

<p>I believe Michael made a really excellent job of digging
out the bullet and dressing the wound. Of course, the ball
had not penetrated very deeply, or a penknife would hardly
have been the appropriate surgical tool; but, as things
were, a doctor could not have been very much quicker, nor
the healing of the wound more clean and rapid.</p>

<p>And when the bandage was fastened, the Captain, in the
presence of the whole Band and some temporary members,
visitors, raised me to the seventh heaven of joy and pride
by solemnly conferring upon me in perpetuity, the rank
and title of Stout Fella, in that I had shed no tear and
uttered no sound during a major operation of "naval surgery
without aesthetics."</p>

<p>Further, he awarded me the signal and high honour of a
full-dress "<i>Viking's funeral.</i>"</p>

<p>Now a Viking's funeral cannot be solemnised every day
in the week, for it involves, among other things, the
destruction of a long-ship.</p>

<p>The dead Viking is laid upon a funeral pyre in the
centre of his ship, his spear and shield are laid beside
him, his horse and hound are slaughtered and their bodies
placed in attendance, the pyre is lighted, and the ship
sent out to sea with all sail set.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the offending French ship was
dedicated to these ocean obsequies.</p>

<p>A specially selected lead soldier was solemnly endowed
with the name and attributes of <i>The Viking Eorl, John
Geste,</i> laid upon a matchbox filled with explosives, a pyre
of matches built round him on the deck of the ship (the
ship drenched with paraffin), his horse laid at the head of
his pyre, and a small (china) dog at his feet.</p>

<p>All being ready, we bared our heads, Michael, with
raised hand, solemnly uttered the beautiful words, "<i>Ashes
to ashes and dust to dust, if God won't have you the devil
must,</i>" and, applying a match to the pyre, shoved the
long-ship (late French battleship) well out into the middle
of the lily-pond.</p>

<p>Here it burned gloriously, the leaping flames consuming
the mast and sail so that the charred wreckage went by the
board, and we stood silent, envisaging the horrors of a
burning ship at sea.</p>

<p>As the vessel burned down to the water's edge, and then
disappeared with hissings and smoking, Michael broke the
ensuing silence with words that I was to remember many
years later in a very different place. (Apparently Digby
remembered them too.)</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> what I call a funeral!" said Michael. "Compare
that with being stuck ten feet down in the mud and clay of
a beastly cemetery for worms to eat and maggots to wriggle
about in you.... Cripes! I'd give something to have one
like that when my turn comes.... Good idea! I'll write it
down in my will, and none of you dirty little dogs will get
anything from me, unless you see it properly done."</p>

<p>"Righto, Beau," said Digby. "I'll give you one, old
chap, whenever you like."</p>

<p>"So will I you, Dig, if you die first," replied Michael
to his twin, and they solemnly shook hands upon it....</p>

<p>My gratification for these honours was the greater in
that nothing had been further from my thoughts than such
promotion and reward. Frequently had I striven in the past
to win one of the Band's recognised Orders of Merit&mdash;
Faithful Hound, Good Egg, Stout Fella, or even Order of
Michael (For Valour)&mdash; but had never hitherto won
any decoration or recognition beyond some such cryptic
remark from the Captain as, "We shall have to make John
Chaplain to the Band, if he does many more of these Good
Deeds...."</p>

<p>That evening when we were variously employed in the
schoolroom, old Burdon, the butler, came and told us that
we could go into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Claudia and Isobel were there, the former talking in a
very self-possessed and grown-up way to a jolly-looking
foreign person, to whom we were presented. He turned out
to be a French cavalry officer, and we were thrilled to
discover that he was on leave from Morocco where he had
been fighting.</p>

<p>"Bags I we get him up to the schoolroom to-morrow,"
whispered Michael, as we gathered round a glass dome, like
a clock-cover, inverted over a white velvet cushion on
which lay the "Blue Water" sapphire.</p>

<p>We looked at it in silence, and, to me, it seemed to
grow bigger and bigger until I felt as though I could
plunge head first into it.</p>

<p>Young as I was, I distinctly had the feeling that
it would not be a good thing to stare too long at that
wonderful concentration of living colour. It seemed alive
and, though inexpressibly beautiful, a little sinister.</p>

<p>"May we handle it, Aunt Patricia?" asked Claudia, and,
as usual, she got her way.</p>

<p>Aunt Patricia lifted off the glass cover and handed the
jewel to the Frenchman, who quickly gave it to Claudia.</p>

<p>"That has caused we know not what of strife and sorrow
and bloodshed," he said. "What a tale it could tell!"</p>

<p>"Can you tell tales of strife and bloodshed, please?"
asked Michael, and as Claudia said, "Why, of course! He
leads charges of Arab cavalry like <i>Under Two Flags,</i>" as
though she had known him for years, we all begged him to
tell us about his fighting, and he ranked second only to
the "Blue Water" as a centre of attraction.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon, the Captain deputed Claudia
to get the Frenchman to tell us some tales.</p>

<p>"Decoy yon handsome stranger to our lair," quoth he. "I
would wring his secrets from him."</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Claudia exercised her fascinations upon
him after lunch, and brought him to our camp in the Bower,
a clearing in the woods near the house.</p>

<p>Here he sat on a log and absolutely thrilled us to
the marrow of our bones by tales, most graphically and
realistically told, of the Spahis, the French Foreign
Legion, the Chasseurs d'Afrique, Zouaves, Turcos, and other
romantically named regiments.</p>

<p>He told us of desert warfare, of Arab cruelties and
chivalries, of hand-to-hand combats wherein swordsman met
swordsman on horseback as in days of old, of brave deeds,
of veiled Touaregs, veiled women, secret Moorish cities,
oases, mirages, sand-storms, and the wonders of Africa.</p>

<p>Then he showed us fencing-tricks and feats of
swordsmanship, until, when he left us, after shaking
our hands and kissing Claudia, we were his, body and
soul....</p>

<p>"I'm going to join the French Foreign Legion when I
leave Eton," announced Michael suddenly. "Get a commission
and then join his regiment."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Digby, of course.</p>

<p>"And I," I agreed.</p>

<p>Augustus Brandon looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Could I be a <i>vivandière</i> and come too!" asked
Isobel.</p>

<p>"You shall all visit me in your officers' uniforms,"
promised Claudia. "French officers always wear them in
France. Very nice too."...</p>

<p>Next day we went back to our preparatory school at
Slough.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">The next time I saw the "Blue Water" was
during the holidays before our last half at Eton.</p>

<p>The occasion was the visit of General Sir Basil
Malcolmson, an authority on gems, who was, at the time,
Keeper of the Jewel House at the Tower of London, and had,
I think, something to do with the British Museum. He had
written a "popular" history of the well-known jewels of
the world, under the title of <i>Famous Gems,</i> and was now
writing a second volume dealing with less-known stones of
smaller value.</p>

<p>He had written to ask if he might include an account of
the "Blue Water" sapphire and its history.</p>

<p>I gathered from what Claudia had heard her say, that
Aunt Patricia was not extraordinarily delighted about it,
and that she had replied that she would be very pleased to
show Sir Basil the stone; but that very little was known
of its history beyond the fact that it had been "acquired"
(kindly word) by the seventh Sir Hector Brandon in India in
the eighteenth century, when he was a soldier of fortune in
the service of one of the Nawabs or Rajahs of the Deccan,
probably Nunjeraj, Sultan of Mysore.</p>

<p>The General was a very interesting talker, and at dinner
that night he told us about such stones as the Timour Ruby,
the Hope Diamond, and the Stuart Sapphire (which is in the
King's crown), until the conversation at times became a
monologue, which I, personally, greatly enjoyed.</p>

<p>I remember his telling us that it was he who discovered
that the Nadirshah Uncut Emerald was not, as had been
supposed, a lump of glass set in cheap and crude Oriental
gold-work. It had been brought to this country after
the Mutiny as an ordinary example of mediaeval Indian
jewel-setting, and was shown as such at the Exhibition at
the Crystal Palace. Sir Basil Malcolmson had examined it
and found that the "scratches" on it were actually the
names of the Moghul Emperors who had owned it and had
worn it in their turbans. This had established, once and
for all, the fact that it is one of the world's greatest
historic gems, was formerly in the Peacock Throne at Delhi,
and literally priceless in value. I think he added that it
was now in the Regalia at the Tower of London.</p>

<p>I wondered whether the "Blue Water" and the "Nadirshah
Emerald" had ever met in India, and whether the blue stone
had seen as much of human misery and villainy as the great
green one. Quite possibly, the sapphire had faced the
emerald, the one in the turban of Shivaji, the Maratha
soldier of fortune, and the other in that of Akhbar, the
Moghul Emperor.</p>

<p>And I remember wondering whether the stones, the one
in the possession of a country gentleman, the other in
that of the King of England, had reached the ends of
their respective histories of theft, bloodshed, and human
suffering.</p>

<p>Certainly it seemed impossible that the "Blue Water"
should again "see life" (and death)&mdash;until one
remembered that such stones are indestructible and
immortal, and may be, thousands of years hence, the cause
of any crime that greed and covetousness can father....</p>

<p>Anyhow, I should be glad to see the big sapphire again,
and hear anything that Sir Basil might have to say about
it.</p>

<p>I remember that Augustus distinguished himself that
evening.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much you'd give Aunt for the 'Blue
Water,'" he remarked to Sir Basil.</p>

<p>"I am not a dealer," replied that gentleman.</p>

<p>And when Claudia asked Aunt Patricia if she were going
to show Sir Basil the Priests' Hole and the hiding-place
of the safe in which the sapphire reposed, the interesting
youth observed:</p>

<p>"Better not, Aunt. He might come back and pinch it one
dark night&mdash;the sapphire I mean, not the Hole."</p>

<p>Ignoring him, Aunt Patricia said that she would take Sir
Basil and the other guest, a man named Lawrence, a Nigerian
official who was an old friend, and show them the Priests'
Hole.</p>

<p>The conversation then turned upon the marvellous
history of the Hope Diamond, and the incredible but
true tale of the misfortune which invariably befell its
possessor; upon Priests' Holes and the varying tide of
religious persecution which led to the fact that the
same hiding-place had sheltered Roman Catholic priests
and Protestant pastors in turn; and upon the day when
Elizabethan troopers, searching for Father Campion,
did damage to our floors, pictures, panelling, and
doors (traces of which are still discernible), without
discovering the wonderfully-contrived Priests' Hole at
all.</p>

<p>It was near the end of this very interesting dinner that
our beloved and reverend old friend, the Chaplain, made it
more memorable than it otherwise would have been.</p>

<p>He had sat throughout dinner behaving beautifully,
talking beautifully, and looking beautiful (with his ivory
face and silver hair, which made him look twenty years
older than he was), and then, just as Burdon put the
decanters in front of him, he suddenly did what he had
never done before&mdash;"broke out" in Aunt Patricia's
presence. We had often known him to be queer, and it was an
open secret in the house that he was to be humoured when
queer (but if open, it was still a secret nevertheless),
though he was always perfectly normal in Aunt Patricia's
presence.</p>

<p>And now it happened!</p>

<p>"Burdon," said he, in the quiet voice in which one
speaks "aside" to a servant, "could you get me a very
beautiful white rabbit with <i>large</i> pink eyes, and, if
possible, a nice pink ribbon round its neck? A mauve would
do.... But on no account pale blue ribbon, Burdon."</p>

<p>It was a bad break and we all did our best to cover
it up by talking fast--but Burdon and Michael were
splendid.</p>

<p>"Certainly, your Reverence," said Burdon without
turning a hair, and marched straight to the screen by the
service-door, as one expecting to find a white rabbit on
the table behind it.</p>

<p>"That's a novel idea, sir," said Michael. "I suppose
it's a modern equivalent of the roast peacock brought to
table in its feathers, looking as though it were alive?
Great idea..."</p>

<p>"Yes," Digby took him up. "Boar's head, with glass eyes
and all that. Never heard of a rabbit served in its jacket
though, I think. Good idea, anyhow."</p>

<p>The Chaplain smiled vacantly, and Augustus Brandon
giggled and remarked:</p>

<p>"I knew a man who jugged his last hair, though."</p>

<p>I hastened to join in, and Isobel began to question the
Chaplain as to the progress of his book on Old Glass, a
book which he had been writing for years, the subject being
his pet hobby.</p>

<p>I wondered whether my aunt, at the head of the table,
had noticed anything. Glancing at her, I saw that she
looked ten years older than she had done before it
happened.</p>

<p>As I held the door open, when the ladies retired after
dinner, she whispered to me in passing, "Tell Michael to
look after the Chaplain this evening. He has been suffering
from insomnia and is not himself."</p>

<p>But later, in the drawing-room, when the "Blue Water"
was smiling, beguiling, and alluring from its white velvet
cushion beneath the glass dome, and we stood round the
table on which it lay, the Chaplain certainly was himself,
and, if possible, even more learned and interesting on the
subject of gems than the great Sir Basil.</p>

<p>I was very thankful indeed, for my heart ached for Aunt
Patricia as she watched him; watched him just as a mother
would watch an only child of doubtful sanity, balanced
between her hope and her fear, her passionate denial of its
idiocy, her passionate joy in signs of its normality.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">Poor Aunt Patricia! She had contracted an
alliance with Sir Hector Brandon as one might contract a
disease. The one alleviation of this particular affliction
being its intermittence; for this monument of selfishness
was generally anywhere but at home, he being a mighty
hunter before the Lord (or the Devil) and usually in
pursuit of prey, biped or quadruped, in distant places. It
is a good thing to have a fixed purpose, an aim, and an
ambition in life, and Sir Hector boasted one. It was to
be able to say that he had killed one of every species of
beast and bird and fish in the world, and had courted a
woman of every nationality in the world! A great soul fired
with a noble ambition.</p>

<p>As children, we did not, of course, realise what Aunt
Patricia suffered at the hands of this violent and bad man
when he was at home, nor what his tenants and labourers
suffered when he was absent.</p>

<p>As we grew older, however, it was impossible to avoid
knowing that he was universally hated, and that he bled
the estate shamefully and shamelessly, that he might enjoy
himself abroad.</p>

<p>Children might die of diphtheria through faulty drains
or lack of drains; old people might die of chills and
rheumatism through leaking roofs and damply rotting
cottages; every farmer might have a cankering grievance;
the estate-agent might have the position and task of a
flint-skinning slave-owner; but Sir Hector's yacht and Sir
Hector's lady-friends would lack for nothing, nor his path
through life be paved with anything less than gold.</p>

<p>And Lady Brandon might remain at home to face the
music&mdash;whether angry growls of wrath, or feeble cries
of pain.</p>

<p>But we boys and girls were exceedingly fortunate, a
happy band who followed our leader Michael, care-free and
joyous....</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">I think that the feat of Michael's that
impressed us most, was his sustaining the rôle of a Man
in Armour successfully for what seemed an appallingly
long time. (It was nearly long enough to cause my death,
anyhow!)</p>

<p>We were in the outer hall one wet afternoon, and the
brilliant idea of dressing up in one of the suits of armour
occurred to the Captain of the Band.</p>

<p>Nothing loth, we, his henchmen, quickly became Squires
of, more or less, High Degree, and with much ingenuity and
more string, more or less correctly cased the knight in his
armour.</p>

<p>He was just striking an attitude and bidding a caitiff
to die, when the sound of a motor-horn anachronistically
intruded and the Band dispersed as do rabbits at the report
of a gun.</p>

<p>Michael stepped up on to the pedestal and stood at ease.
(Ease!) Digby fled up the stairs, the girls dashed into
the drawing-room, Augustus and another visitor rushed down
a corridor to the service-staircase, and I, like Ginevra,
dived into a great old chest on the other side of the
hall.</p>

<p>There I lay as though screwed down in a coffin and pride
forbade me ignominiously to crawl forth. I realised that I
was suffering horribly&mdash;and the next thing that I knew
was that I was lying on my bed and Michael was smiting my
face with a wet sponge while Digby dealt kindly blows upon
my chest and stomach.</p>

<p>When sufficiently recovered and sufficiently rebuked
for being such an ass, I was informed that Aunt Patricia
had driven up with a "black man"&mdash; mystery of
mysteries!&mdash;and had confabulated with him right in
front of the Man in Armour, afterwards speeding the "black
man" on his way again in her car.</p>

<p>We were much intrigued, and indulged in much
speculation&mdash;the more, in that Michael would not say
a word beyond that such a person <i>had</i> come and had gone
again, and that he himself had contrived to remain so
absolutely still in that heavy armour that not a creak,
rustle, clank, or other sound had betrayed the fact that
there actually was a Man in the Armour!</p>

<p>In the universal and deserved admiration for this feat,
my own poor performance in preferring death to discovery
and dishonour passed unpraised.</p>

<p>I must do Michael the justice, however, to state that
directly Aunt Patricia had left the hall, he had hurried
to raise the lid of the chest in which I was entombed, and
had himself carried me upstairs as soon as his armour was
removed and restored to its place.</p>

<p>Digby, who, from long and painful practice, was an
expert bugler, took down his old coach-horn from its place
on the wall and blew what he said was an "honorific fanfare
of heralds' trumpets," in recognition of the <i>tenacity</i>
displayed both by Michael and myself.</p>

<p>I must confess, however, that in spite of Michael's
reticence concerning the visit of the "black man," we
others discussed the strange event in all its bearings.</p>

<p>We, however, arrived at no conclusion, and were driven
to content ourselves with a foolish theory that the strange
visitor was in some way connected with a queer boy, now a
very distinguished and enlightened ruler in India. He was
the oldest son and heir of the Maharajah, his father, and
had been at the College for the sons of Ruling Princes in
India, I think the Rajkumar College at Ajmir, before coming
to Eton.</p>

<p>He was a splendid athlete and sportsman, and devoted to
Michael to the point of worship.</p>

<p>Aunt Patricia welcomed him to Brandon Abbas at Michael's
request, and when he saw the "Blue Water" <i>he actually and
literally and completely fainted.</i></p>

<p>I suppose the sight of the sapphire was the occasion
rather than the cause, but the fact remains. It was queer
and uncanny beyond words, the more so because he never
uttered a sound, and neither then nor subsequently ever
said one syllable on the subject of the great jewel!</p>

<p>And so we lived our happy lives at Brandon Abbas, when
not at our prep. school, at Eton, or later, at Oxford.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch202" id="ch202">II</a>. &mdash; THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE "BLUE WATER"</h2>

<p class="first">AND then, one autumn evening, the face
of life changed as utterly and suddenly as unexpectedly.
The act of one person altered the lives of all of us, and
brought suffering, exile, and death in its train.</p>

<p>I am neither a student nor a philosopher, but I would
like some convinced exponent of the doctrine of Free Will
to explain how we are anything but the helpless victims of
the consequences of the acts of other people. How I envy
the grasp and logic of those great minds that can easily
reconcile "<i>unto the third and fourth generation,</i>" for
example, with this comfortable doctrine!</p>

<p>On this fine autumn evening, so ordinary, so secure and
comfortable, so fateful and momentous, we sat in the great
drawing-room of Brandon Abbas, after dinner, all together
for what proved to be the last time. There were present
Aunt Patricia, the Chaplain, Claudia, Isobel, Michael,
Digby, Augustus Brandon, and myself.</p>

<p>Aunt Patricia asked Claudia to sing, and that young lady
excused herself on the score of being out of sorts and not
feeling like it. She certainly looked pale and somewhat
below her usual sparkling standard of health and spirits. I
had thought for some days that she had seemed preoccupied
and worried, and I had wondered if her bridge-debts and
dressmakers' bills were the cause of it.</p>

<p>With her wonted desire to be helpful and obliging,
Isobel went to the piano, and for some time we sat
listening to her sweet and sympathetic voice, while my aunt
knitted, the Chaplain twiddled his thumbs, Claudia wrestled
with some unpleasant problem in frowning abstraction,
Augustus shuffled and tapped his cigarette-case with a
cigarette he dared not light, Digby turned over the leaves
of a magazine, and Michael watched Claudia.</p>

<p>Presently Isobel rose and closed the piano.</p>

<p>"What about a game of pills?" said Augustus, and before
anyone replied, Claudia said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt, <i>do</i> let's have the 'Blue Water' down for a
little while. I haven't seen it for ages."</p>

<p>"Rather!" agreed Michael. "Let's do a gloat, Aunt," and
the Chaplain supported him and said he'd be delighted to
get it, if Lady Brandon would give permission.</p>

<p>Only he and Aunt Patricia knew the <i>secret</i> of the
Priests' Hole (excepting Sir Hector, of course), and I
believe it would have taken an extraordinarily ingenious
burglar to have discovered it, even given unlimited
opportunity, before tackling the safe in which the "Blue
Water," with other valuables, reposed. (I know that
Michael, Digby, and I had spent countless hours, with
the knowledge and consent of our aunt, in trying to
find, without the slightest success, the trick of this
hiding-place of more than one hunted divine. It became an
obsession with Michael.)...</p>

<p>Aunt Patricia agreed at once, and the Chaplain
disappeared. He had a key which gave access to the
hiding-place of the keys of the safe which the Priests'
Hole guarded.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the 'Blue Water' worth, Aunt Patricia?" asked
Claudia.</p>

<p>"To whom, dear?" was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what would a Hatton Garden person give for
it?"</p>

<p>"About a half what he thought his principal would be
willing to offer, perhaps."</p>

<p>"And what would that be, about, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Claudia. If some American millionaire
were very anxious to buy it, I suppose he'd try to find out
the lowest sum that would be considered," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What <i>would</i> you ask, supposing you <i>were</i> going to
sell it?" persisted Claudia.</p>

<p>"I certainly am not going to sell it," said Aunt
Patricia, in a voice that should have closed the
conversation. She had that day received a letter from her
husband announcing his early return from India, and it had
not cheered her at all.</p>

<p>"I did hear someone say once that Uncle Hector was
offered thirty thousand pounds for it," said Augustus.</p>

<p>"Did you?" replied Aunt Patricia, and at that moment
the Chaplain returned, carrying the sapphire on its white
velvet cushion, under its glass dome. He placed it on a
table under the big hanging chandelier, with its countless
cut-glass pendants and circle of electric bulbs.</p>

<p>There it lay, its incredible, ineffable, glowing blue
fascinating us as we gazed upon it.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a wonderful thing," said Isobel, and I wondered
how often those very words had been said of it.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me kiss it," cried Claudia, and with one hand
the Chaplain raised the glass dome, and with the other
handed the sapphire to Aunt Patricia, who examined it as
though she had not handled it a thousand times. She looked
through it at the light. She then passed it to Claudia, who
fondled it awhile.</p>

<p>We all took it in turn, Augustus throwing it up and
catching it as he murmured, "Thirty thousand pounds for a
bit of glass!"</p>

<p>When Michael got it, I thought he was never going to
pass it on. He weighed and rubbed and examined it, more in
the manner of a dealer than an admirer of the beautiful.</p>

<p>Finally, the Chaplain put it back on its cushion and
replaced the glass cover.</p>

<p>We sat and stood around for a few minutes, while the
Chaplain said something about Indian Rajahs and their
marvellous hereditary and historical jewels.</p>

<p>I was standing close to the table, bending over and
peering into the depths of the sapphire again; Augustus
was reiterating, "Who says a game of pills, pills, pills?"
when, suddenly, as occasionally happened, the electric
light failed, and we were plunged in complete darkness.</p>

<p>"What's Fergusson up to now?" said Digby, alluding to
the head chauffeur, who was responsible for the engine.</p>

<p>"It'll come on again in a minute," said Aunt Patricia,
and added, "Burdon will bring candles if it doesn't....
Don't wander about, anybody, and knock things over."</p>

<p>Somebody brushed lightly against me as I stood by the
table.</p>

<p>"Ghosts and goblins!" said Isobel in a sepulchral voice.
"Who's got a match? A skeleton hand is about to clutch my
throat. I can see..."</p>

<p>"Everybody," I remarked, as the light came on again, and
we blinked at each other in the dazzling glare, so suddenly
succeeding the velvet darkness.</p>

<p>"Saved!" said Isobel, with an exaggerated sigh of
relief, and then, as I looked at her, she stared wide-eyed
and open-mouthed, and then pointed speechless....</p>

<p>The "Blue Water" had vanished. The white velvet cushion
was bare, and the glass cover covered nothing but the
cushion.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">We must have looked a foolish band
as we stood and stared, for a second or two, at that
extraordinarily empty-looking abode of the great sapphire.
I never saw anything look so empty in my life. Aunt
Patricia broke the silence and the spell.</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> joke, Augustus?" she enquired, in that
rarely-used tone of hers that would have made an elephant
feel small.</p>

<p>"Eh? <i>Me?</i> No, Aunt! Really! I swear! <i>I</i> never touched
it," declared the youth, colouring warmly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there's someone with a sense of humour all
his own," she observed, and I was glad that I was not the
misguided humorist. Also I was glad that she had regarded
the joke as more probably Augustan than otherwise.</p>

<p>"You were standing by the table, John," she continued,
turning to me. "Are you the jester?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt," I replied with feeble wit, "only the
Geste."</p>

<p>As Digby and Michael both flatly denied any part in this
poor practical joke, Aunt Patricia turned to the girls.</p>

<p>"Surely not?" she said, raising her fine eyebrows.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt, I was too busy with ghosts and goblins and
the skeleton hand, to use my own hand for sticking and
peeling&mdash;I mean picking and stealing," said Isobel.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> haven't got it," said Claudia.</p>

<p>Lady Brandon and the Reverend Maurice Ffolliot eyed the
six of us with cold severity.</p>

<p>"Let us say nothing of the good taste displayed, either
in the act or in the denial," said the former, "but agree
that the brilliant joke has been carried far enough, shall
we?"</p>

<p>"Put the brilliant joke back, John," said Augustus. "You
were the only one near it when the light went out."</p>

<p>"I have said that I didn't touch the sapphire," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Suppose <i>you</i> put it back, Ghastly," said Digby, and
his voice had an edge on it.</p>

<p>"And suppose <i>you</i> do!" blustered Augustus angrily.</p>

<p>Digby, who was standing behind him, suddenly raised his
right knee with sufficient force to propel the speaker
in the direction of the table&mdash;an exhibition of
ill manners and violence that passed unrebuked by Aunt
Patricia.</p>

<p>"I haven't <i>got</i> the beastly thing, I tell you," shouted
the smitten one, turning ferociously upon Digby. "It's one
of you three rotters."</p>

<p>It was an absurd situation, rapidly degenerating
into an unpleasant one, and my aunt's lips were growing
thinner, and her eyebrows beginning to contract toward her
high-bridged nose.</p>

<p>"Look here, sillies!" said Isobel, as we brothers glared
at Augustus and he glared at us, "I am going to turn all
the lights out again for two minutes. Whoever played the
trick, and told the fib, is to put the 'Blue Water' back.
Then no one will know who did it. See?" and she walked away
to the door, by which were the electric-light switches.</p>

<p>"Now!" she said. "Everybody keep still except the
villain, and when I switch the lights on again, there will
be the 'Blue Water' laughing at us."</p>

<p>"Oh, rot," said Augustus, and out went the lights before
Aunt Patricia or the Chaplain made any comment.</p>

<p>Now it occurred to me that it would be very interesting
to know who had played this silly practical joke and told
a silly lie after it. I therefore promptly stepped towards
the table, felt the edge of it with my right hand and then,
with a couple of tentative dabs, laid my left hand on top
of the glass dome. Whoever came to return the sapphire must
touch me, and him I would promptly seize. I might not have
felt so interested in the matter had it not been twice
pointed out that it was I who stood against the table when
the light failed.</p>

<p>Isobel's device for securing the prompt return of the
sapphire was an excellent one, but I saw no reason why I
should linger under the suspicion of having been an ass and
a liar, for the benefit of Augustus.</p>

<p>So there I stood and waited.</p>

<p>While doing so, it occurred to me to wonder what would
happen if the joker did not have the good sense to take
advantage of the opportunity provided by Isobel....</p>

<p>Perfect silence reigned in the big room.</p>

<p>"I can't do it, my boots creak," said Digby suddenly.</p>

<p>"I can't find the cover," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Another minute, villain," said Isobel. "Hurry up."</p>

<p>And then I was conscious that someone was breathing very
near me. I felt a faint touch on my elbow. A hand came down
lightly against my wrist&mdash;and I grabbed.</p>

<p>My left hand was round a coat-sleeve, beneath which
was the stiff cuff of a dress shirt, and my right grasped
a wrist. I was very glad that it was a man's arm. Had it
been a girl's I should have let go. Ghastly Gustus, of
course.... It was just the silly sort of thing he would do,
and it was just like him to take advantage of the darkness,
when he found the joke had fallen remarkably flat. I did
not envy him the look that would appear on Aunt Patricia's
face when the light went up and he was discovered in my
grip.</p>

<p>I would have let him go, I think, had he not endeavoured
to put the blame on me, and insisted on my nearness to the
table when the light failed.</p>

<p>I was a little surprised that he did not struggle, and I
was prepared for a sudden violent twist and a swift evasion
in the dark.</p>

<p>He kept perfectly still.</p>

<p>"I am going to count ten, and then up goes the light.
Are you ready, villain?" came the voice of Isobel from the
door.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've put it back," said Digby.</p>

<p>"So have I," said Michael, close to me.</p>

<p>"And I," echoed Claudia.</p>

<p>Then Isobel switched on the light, and I found that my
hands were clenched on the right arm of&mdash;my brother
Michael!</p>

<p>I was more surprised than I can say.</p>

<p>It was only a small matter, of course; a pointless
practical joke and a pointless lie, but it was so utterly
unlike Michael. It was unlike him to do it, and more
unlike him flatly to deny having done it. And my surprise
increased when Michael, looking at me queerly, actually
remarked:</p>

<p>"So it was <i>me,</i> John, was it? Oh, <i>Feeble</i> Geste!"</p>

<p>I felt absurdly hurt, and turning to Augustus said, "I
apologise, Gussie. I admit I thought it was you."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't add insult to injury," he replied. "Put the
beastly thing back, and stop being a funny ass. Enough of
you is too much."</p>

<p><i>Put the beastly thing back!</i> I turned and looked at
the cushion. It was empty still. I looked at Michael and
Michael looked at me.</p>

<p>"Oh, shove it back, Beau," I said. "It's all been most
extraordinarily clever and amusing, I'm sure. But I'm
inclined to agree with Gussie."</p>

<p>Michael gave me one of his long, thoughtful, penetrating
looks. "H'm," said he.</p>

<p>Isobel came over from the door.</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> think you might have played up, sillies," said
she. "Put it back, Beau, and let's have a dance. May we,
Aunt?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Aunt Patricia, "as soon as ever
the great humorist in our midst has received our
felicitations," and I really pitied the said humorist, when
he should make his avowal, annoyed with him as I felt.</p>

<p>The Chaplain looked from face to face of the six of us
and said nothing. Aunt Patricia did the same.</p>

<p>We all stood silent.</p>

<p>"Now stop this fooling," said she. "Unless the 'Blue
Water' is produced at once, I shall be very seriously
annoyed."</p>

<p>"Come on, somebody," said Digby.</p>

<p>Another minute's silence.</p>

<p>It began to grow unbearable.</p>

<p>"I am waiting," said Lady Brandon at last, and her foot
began to tap.</p>

<p>From that moment the matter became anything but a joke,
swiftly growing unpleasant and increasingly so.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">I shall not forget the succeeding
hours in a hurry, and their horrible atmosphere of
suspicion&mdash;seven people suspecting one of the other
seven, and the eighth person pretending to do so.</p>

<p>My capable and incisive aunt quickly brought things to a
clear issue, upon getting no reply to her "I am waiting,"
and her deliberate look from face to face of the angry and
uncomfortable group around her.</p>

<p>"Maurice," said she to the Chaplain, laying her hand
upon his sleeve, her face softening and sweetening
incredibly, "come and sit by me until I have asked each of
these young people a question. Then I want you to go to
bed, for it's getting late," and she led him to a big and
deep chesterfield that stood on a low dais in a big window
recess.</p>

<p>Seating herself with the air and presence of a queen on
a throne, she said, quietly and very coldly:</p>

<p>"This is getting serious, and unless it ends at once,
the consequences will be serious too. For the last time I
ask the boy, or girl, who moved the 'Blue Water,' to give
it to me, and we will end the silly business now and here,
and make no further reference to it. If not... Come, this
is absurd and ridiculous...."</p>

<p>"Oh, come off it, John," said Augustus, "for God's
sake."</p>

<p>Nobody else spoke.</p>

<p>"Very well," said my aunt, "since the fool won't leave
his folly.... Come here, Claudia.... Have you touched the
'Blue Water' since the Chaplain restored it to its place?"
She laid her hand on Claudia's arm, drew her close, and
looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt...."</p>

<p>"No, Aunt," said Claudia again.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Aunt Patricia. "Go to bed, dear.
Good night."</p>

<p>And Claudia departed, not without an indignant glance at
me.</p>

<p>"Come here, Isobel," continued my aunt. "Have you
touched the 'Blue Water' since the Chaplain put it back in
its place?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt, I have not," replied Isobel.</p>

<p>"I am sure you have not. Go to bed. Good night," said
Lady Brandon.</p>

<p>Isobel turned to go and then stopped.</p>

<p>"But I might have done, Aunt, if the idea had occurred
to me," she said. "It is just a joke, of course."</p>

<p>"Bed," rejoined her aunt, and Isobel departed with a
kind glance at me.</p>

<p>Aunt Patricia turned to Augustus.</p>

<p>"Come here," she said coldly, and with a hard stare
into his somewhat shifty eyes. "Please answer absolutely
truthfully&mdash;for your own sake. If you have got the
'Blue Water,' and give it to me now, I shall not say
another word about the matter. Have you?"</p>

<p>"I swear to God, Aunt..." broke out Augustus.</p>

<p>"You need not swear to God, nor to me, Augustus," was
the cold reply. "Yes or No. Have you got it?"</p>

<p>"<i>No,</i> Aunt! I take my solemn oath I..." the
unhappy youth replied vehemently, when the cold voice
interrupted:</p>

<p>"Have you touched the sapphire since the Chaplain put it
under its cover?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt. <i>Really,</i> I haven't! I assure you I..." began
Augustus, to be again interrupted by the cold question:</p>

<p>"Do you know where the 'Blue Water' is now?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt," promptly replied he, "upon my soul I don't.
If I did, I'd jolly well..."</p>

<p>"John," said my aunt, without further notice of
Augustus, "do you know where the stone is?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt," I replied, and added, "nor have I touched it
since the Chaplain did."</p>

<p>She favoured me with a long, long look, which I was able
to meet quite calmly, and I hope not at all rudely. As I
looked away, my eyes met Michael's. He was watching me
queerly.</p>

<p>Then came Digby's turn. He said quite simply and plainly
that he knew nothing about the jewel's disappearance and
had not touched it since it was passed to him by Claudia,
and handed on by him to Isobel.</p>

<p>There remained Michael. He was the culprit, or else
one of us had told a most deliberate, calculated, and
circumstantial lie, inexcusable and disgraceful.</p>

<p>I felt angrier with Michael than I had ever done in my
life, yet I was angry rather <i>for</i> him than with him. It
was so utterly unlike him to do such a stupid thing, and to
allow all this unpleasant and undignified inquisition to go
on, when a word from him would have ended it.</p>

<p>Why must my idol act as though he had feet of
clay&mdash;or, at any rate, smear clay upon his feet? The
joke was unworthy, but the lie was really painfully so.</p>

<p>I have no objection to the good thumping lie that is "a
very present help in time of trouble," told at the right
time and in the right cause (such as to save the other
fellow's bacon). But I have the strongest distaste for a
silly lie that merely gives annoyance to other people, and
puts blame upon an innocent person.</p>

<p>From the moment I had caught him in the act of trying
to return the jewel secretly, I had felt sick with
indignation, and literally and physically sick when, his
effort frustrated by me, he had pretended innocence and
held on for another opportunity of returning the thing
unseen.</p>

<p>Had I not myself caught him in the very act, he was, of
all of us, the last person whom I should have suspected.
He and Isobel, that is to say. I should have strongly
suspected Augustus, and, his innocence established, I
should have supposed that Digby had fallen a victim to his
incurable love of joking&mdash;though I should have been
greatly surprised.</p>

<p>Had Digby then been proved innocent, I am afraid
I should have suspected Claudia of wishing to turn
the limelight on herself by an innocently naughty
escapade&mdash;before I should ever have entertained the
idea of Michael doing it and denying it.</p>

<p>Now that all had firmly and categorically declared their
absolute innocence and ignorance in the matter, I had no
option (especially in view of my catching him at the spot)
but to conclude that Michael had been what I had never
known him to be before&mdash;a fool, a cad, and a liar.</p>

<p>I could have struck him for hurting himself so.</p>

<p>"Michael," said Aunt Patricia very gravely, very coldly,
and very sadly, "I'm sorry. More so than I can tell you,
Michael. Please put the 'Blue Water' back, and I will say
no more. But I doubt whether I shall feel like calling you
'Beau' for some time."</p>

<p>"I <i>can't</i> put it back, Aunt, for I haven't got it,"
said Michael quietly, and my heart bounded.</p>

<p>"Do you know where it is, Michael?" asked my aunt.</p>

<p>"I do not, Aunt," was the immediate reply.</p>

<p>"Have you touched the sapphire since the Chaplain did,
Michael?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"I have not, Aunt," was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about its disappearance, Michael?"
asked the hard level voice.</p>

<p>"I only know that <i>I</i> have had nothing whatever to do
with its disappearance, Aunt," answered my brother, and I
was aghast.</p>

<p>"Do you declare that all you have just said is the
absolute truth, Michael?" was the final question.</p>

<p>"I declare it to be the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth," was the final answer.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">What was I to think? Certainly I could not
think that Michael was lying. Equally certainly I could not
forget that I had caught his hand on the glass cover.</p>

<p>On the whole, if I had to doubt either Michael or the
evidence of my senses, I preferred to do the latter. When
we got out of that terrible room, I would go to him when
he was alone, and say, "Beau, old chap, just tell <i>me</i> you
didn't touch the thing&mdash;and if you say you didn't,
there's an absolute end of it." And so there would be as
far as I was concerned....</p>

<p>On hearing his last words, my aunt sat and stared at
Michael. The silence grew horrible. At length she began to
speak in a low frozen voice.</p>

<p>"This is inexpressibly vulgar and disgusting," she
began. "One of half a dozen boys and girls, who have
practically grown up here, is a despicable liar and,
apparently, a common thief&mdash;or an uncommon one. I am
still unable to think the latter.... Listen.... I shall
leave the cover where it is and I shall lock the doors of
this room at midnight and keep the keys, except the key of
that one. Bring it to me, Digby.... Thank you.</p>

<p>"This key I shall put in the old brass box on the ledge
above the fire-place in the outer hall. The servants will
have gone to bed and will know nothing of its whereabouts.
I ask the liar, who is present, to take the opportunity
of returning the sapphire during the night, relocking the
door, and replacing the key in the brass box. If this is
<i>not</i> done by the time I come down to-morrow, I shall
have to conclude that the liar <i>is</i> also a thief, and act
accordingly. For form's sake I shall tell Claudia and
Isobel."</p>

<p>"Come, Maurice," she added, rising and taking the
Chaplain's arm. "I do hope you won't let this worry you,
and give you a sleepless night."</p>

<p>The poor Chaplain looked too unhappy, bewildered, and
bemused to speak.</p>

<p>Having locked two of the doors, Lady Brandon, followed
by the Chaplain, swept from the room without a "Good night"
to any of us.</p>

<p>I think we each heaved a sigh of relief as the door
shut. I certainly did.</p>

<p>And now, what?</p>

<p>Digby turned upon Augustus.</p>

<p>"Oh, you unutterable cheese-mite," he said, apparently
more in sorrow than in anger. "I think de-bagging is
indicated.... And a leather belt," he added, "unless
anyone's pumps are nice and swishy."</p>

<p>I said nothing. It was not the hand of Augustus that I
had caught feeling for the cover.</p>

<p>He glared from one to the other of us like a trapped
rat, and almost shrieked as Digby seized him.</p>

<p>"You lying swine," he shouted. "Who was by the table
when the light failed and came on again? Who was grabbing
who, when Isobel turned it on?"</p>

<p>I looked at Michael, and Michael looked at me.</p>

<p>"Yes," screamed Augustus seeing the look, and wriggling
free.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Digby, "if he pinched it, he's <i>got</i>
it.... Come to my arms, Gus!" and in a moment he was
sitting upon the prostrate form of the hysterically
indignant youth, and feeling the pockets of his
dinner-jacket from the outside.</p>

<p>"Not in his breast-pockets... side... waistcoat...
trousers... no&mdash;the beggar hasn't got it unless he has
swallowed it," announced Digby. Then..." Might have shoved
it behind a cushion or dropped it somewhere.... Come on,
out with it, Gus, and let's get to bed."</p>

<p>"You filthy, lying, beastly cad," blubbered Augustus in
reply, showing the courage of the cornered rat.</p>

<p>I don't think he had ever defied or insulted either of
my brothers before in his life.</p>

<p>I expected to see him promptly suffer grief and pain at
their hands, but Michael did the unexpected, as usual.</p>

<p>"Why, I believe the little man's innocent after all," he
said quite kindly.</p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> I am, you damned hypocrite," shouted
Augustus. "Weren't you and John fumbling at the cover when
she turned the light on&mdash;you cowardly blackguards."</p>

<p>Digby's hand closed on the scruff of the boy's neck.</p>

<p>"If I have accused you wrongly, Gussie, I'll humbly
apologise and make it up to you," said he. "But if we find
you <i>did</i> do it&mdash;oh, my little Gussie...!"</p>

<p>"And if you find it was Michael, or John, or yourself!"
sneered the dishevelled and shaking Augustus.</p>

<p>Michael looked hard at me and I looked hard at him.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Digby, "presumably the thing is in
the room. Aunt wouldn't pinch her own jewel. The Chaplain
has no use for it nor for thirty thousand pounds. No one
supposes Isobel did it&mdash;nor Claudia. That leaves us
four, and we haven't been out of the room. Come on, find
it. Find it, Gussie, and I'll swear that <i>I</i> put it there,"
and Digby began throwing cushions from sofas and chairs,
moving footstools, turning up rugs, and generally hunting
about, the while he encouraged himself, and presumably
Augustus, with cries of "Good dog!... Fetch 'em, boy!...
Seize 'em, Gussie!... Sick 'em, pup!... Worry 'im, Gus!"
and joyful barks.</p>

<p>Michael and I searched methodically and minutely, until
it was perfectly clear that the "Blue Water" was not in the
room, unless far more skilfully concealed than would have
been possible in the dark and in the few minutes at the
disposal of anyone who wished to hide it.</p>

<p>"Well, that's that," said Digby at last. "We'd better
push off before Aunt comes down to lock the door. I don't
want to see her again to-night. Damned if I don't feel
guilty as soon as she looks at me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are!" snarled Augustus.</p>

<p>"You never know, do you?" grinned Digby.</p>

<p>"Better tidy up a bit before we go," suggested Michael.
"Servants'll smell a rat if it's like this to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Smell a herd of elephants, I should think," answered
Digby, and we three straightened the disordered room, while
Augustus sullenly watched us, with an angry, bitter sneer,
and an occasional snarl of "Beastly humbugs," or, "Lying
hypocrites."</p>

<p>"Come to the smoking-room, you two?" said Digby to
Michael and me, when we had finished.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;go and fix it up, cads," urged Augustus.</p>

<p>"Go to bed, Ghastly," replied Digby, "and don't forget
the key will be in the brass box on the ledge over the
fireplace in the outer hall. Bung off."</p>

<p>"For two damns I'd sit in the hall all night, and see
who comes for it," was the reply, and the speaker glanced
at me.</p>

<p>"Don't let <i>me</i> find you there, or I shall slap you,"
said Digby.</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't be popular if I went there now and
refused to budge, should I?" was the angry retort.</p>

<p>"Lord! It's a long worm that has no turning,"
cryptically remarked Digby, as Augustus took what was meant
to be a dignified departure. "And a long lane that has no
public-house," he added.</p>

<p>"Either that lad's innocent or he's a really
accomplished young actor," I observed, looking after the
retreating Augustus as we crossed the hall, where we said
"Good night" to a yawning footman, and made our way down a
corridor to the smoking-room.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">"Well, my sons, what about it!" said
Michael, poking up the fire, as we threw ourselves into
deep leather arm-chairs and produced pipes.</p>

<p>"Pretty go if the damned thing isn't there in the
morning," said Digby.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she'd send to Scotland Yard?" he added,
blowing a long cloud of smoke towards the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Filthy business," said Michael. "Fancy a fat
mystery-merchant prowling about here and questioning
everybody!"</p>

<p>"What a lark!" chuckled Digby. "Jolly glad the servants
are out of it all right, poor beggars."</p>

<p>"Beastly vulgar business, as Aunt said," observed
Michael.</p>

<p>"And a bit rough on her too&mdash;apart from any
question of thirty thousand pounds," said I.</p>

<p>"Shake her faith a bit in human nature, what?" said
Digby. "But, damn it&mdash; the beastly thing will be there
all right in the morning."</p>

<p>"I hope to God it will," said I from the bottom of my
heart, and found that Michael and I were staring at each
other again.</p>

<p>"Reconstruct the dreadful crime," suggested Digby. "Wash
out Aunt and the Chaplain."</p>

<p>"And the girls," said Michael. "If anyone even glanced
at the possibility of Claudia stealing, I'd wring his
beastly neck until he could see all down his beastly
back."</p>

<p>"I'd wring the neck of anyone who even glanced at the
possibility of Isobel stealing&mdash;until he hadn't a head
to see with," added Digby.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be too silly to be worth noticing at all!"
I asked. I was thinking more particularly of Isobel.</p>

<p>"Let's go and <i>beat</i> young Gussie," said Digby.</p>

<p>"Gussie doesn't know a thing about it," said Michael.
"Nothing but genuine injured innocence would have given
him the pluck to call us 'Filthy liars,' and 'Damned
hypocrites.' You know, if he'd been guilty, he'd have been
conciliatory, voluble, and tearful&mdash;oh, altogether
different. A much more humble parishioner."</p>

<p>"Believe you're right, Beau," agreed Digby. "Nothing
like a sense of injustice to put you up on the bough....
'Sides, young Gus hasn't the guts to pinch anything really
valuable.... And if he'd taken it for a lark and hadn't
been able to put it back, he'd have hidden it behind a
cushion till he could. I quite expected to find it in some
such place. That's why I gave him the chance.... If he
<i>has</i> got it, he'll shove it back to-night," he added.</p>

<p>"He hasn't," said Michael&mdash;and again Michael and I
found ourselves looking at each other.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that leaves us three then," said I.</p>

<p>"It does," said Michael.</p>

<p>"You can count me out, old son," grinned Digby. "Search
me."</p>

<p>"Which reminds one, by the way, that we didn't search
ourselves, or each other, when we searched Gussie," said I.
"It would have been fairer..."</p>

<p>"Most undignified and unnecessary," put in Michael.</p>

<p>"So Gussie seemed to find," chuckled Digby.</p>

<p>"Then that leaves you and me, John," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Yes, it leaves me and you, Beau," I agreed, and again
we stared at each other.</p>

<p>"I did not take the 'Blue Water,' Beau," I said.</p>

<p>"<i>Nor did I,</i> John," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Then there's a misdeal somewhere," remarked Digby, "and
Gussie <i>must</i> have done it. Anyhow&mdash;it'll be put back
in the night. Must be."</p>

<p>"What do you say to our sitting here until we hear
somebody come down to the hall? That door always makes a
frightful row," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Michael sharply.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked, eyeing him.</p>

<p>"Why, you ass, it might not be... I mean we might...
Anyhow, we've no right to interfere with Aunt's
arrangements. She has given the person a chance..."</p>

<p>Michael was by no means fluent. He turned to Digby.</p>

<p>"Don't you think so, Dig?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Any ass can sit up who wants to," was the prompt reply.
"I have had enough of to-day, myself. Who's coming up?" He
rose and yawned.</p>

<p>"I say," he chuckled, "what a lark to pinch the key and
hide it."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," said Michael. "Let's go to bed," and
we went with our usual curt "Good nights."...</p>

<p>But it was easier, for me at least, to go to bed than to
go to sleep, although my brain seemed somewhat numbed and
dulled. I lay and tossed and turned, refusing to believe
that Michael had done this disgusting thing, and unable,
somehow, to believe that Augustus had. It did not occur to
me to doubt Digby&mdash;and, as I have said, I should never
have dreamt of doubting Michael, had I not caught him.</p>

<p>Leaving out Aunt Patricia, the Chaplain, Digby, and
Augustus, there remained Isobel, Claudia, Michael, and I.
Eliminating Isobel, there remained Claudia, Michael, and I.
It could not be Claudia. How <i>could</i> it be Michael?</p>

<p>Had <i>I</i> done it myself?</p>

<p>Such was my mental condition by this time that I
actually entertained the idea. I had read a book not so
long before, in which, after a most tremendous mystery and
bother, it turned out that the innocent hero had committed
the crime while in a somnambulistic condition.</p>

<p>That could not apply in my case, of course.... There
was no question or possibility of sleep-walking or trance
about it&mdash;but might I not, absolutely unconsciously
or subconsciously, have put the thing in my pocket without
knowing it? People undoubtedly did do absurd things in fits
of absent-mindedness, to their subsequent incredulous
astonishment. I had never done such things myself&mdash;but
might I not have begun doing them now? It was certainly as
possible as it was utterly improbable. I actually got up
and searched my clothes.</p>

<p>Of course I found nothing, and hour after hour of
cogitation and reiterated argument brought me nearer and
nearer to the conclusion that either Augustus or Michael
was the culprit.</p>

<p>Having repeatedly arrived at this inevitable point, I
delivered myself of the unhelpful verdict, "<i>Augustus or
Michael&mdash;guilty. And I believe Augustus isn't, and
Michael couldn't be!</i>"</p>

<p>Anyhow, daylight would find the wretched stone back in
its place, and the whole business would be merely a very
unsatisfactory and annoying puzzle, until it faded from the
memories of the eight people who knew of it.</p>

<p>I turned over and made another resolute effort to go to
sleep&mdash;a foolish thing to do, as it is one of the best
ways of ensuring wakefulness.</p>

<p>My mind went off on a new tack. Suppose the "Blue Water"
were not put back during the night? What exactly would
happen?</p>

<p>One thing would be clear at any rate&mdash;that a
determined effort was being made to steal the jewel, by
somebody who intended to convert it into money.</p>

<p>Certainly Lady Brandon, that <i>maîtresse femme,</i> was
not the person to accept that "lying down," and she would
surely take precisely the same steps for its recovery that
she would have taken had it been stolen by burglars or a
servant. She would communicate with the police, and see
that no one left the house until the matter was in official
hands.</p>

<p>It would be inexpressibly unpleasant and degrading. I
imagined the questioning, the searching, the loathsome
sense of being under suspicion&mdash;even Isobel and
Claudia. At four o'clock in the morning the whole affair
looked unutterably beastly.</p>

<p>And then I pulled myself together. <i>Of course</i> it would
be all right. The idiot who had played the fool trick, and
been too feeble to own up, would have replaced the jewel.
Probably it was there now. The said idiot would have been
only too anxious to get rid of it as soon as Aunt Patricia
had put the key in the brass box.... Why not go and make
sure?</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;and then one could put the silly
business out of one's mind and get some sleep.</p>

<p>I got out of bed, pulled on my dressing-gown, and put my
feet into bedroom slippers. Lighting one of the emergency
candles which stood on the mantelpiece, I made my way down
the corridor to the upper of the two galleries that ran
round the four sides of the central hall, and descended the
stairs that led to the gallery below, and thence to the
hall. Crossing this, I entered the outer hall, avoided the
protruding hand and sword-hilt of a figure in armour, and
made my silent way to the big stone fire-place.</p>

<p>On the broad shelf or mantelpiece, some six feet from
the ground, was the ancient brass box, dating from the
days of pack-horse travel, in which my aunt had placed the
key.</p>

<p>Only she hadn't&mdash;or someone had removed
it&mdash;for the box was quite empty!</p>

<p>Was this a trap, a trick of Lady Brandon's to catch the
guilty one? Justly or unjustly, I thought she was quite
capable of it.</p>

<p>If so, presumably I was caught again in this
indiscriminating trap that another should have adorned. I
was reminded of the occasion many years before, when she
suddenly entered the schoolroom and said, "The naughty
child that has been in the still-room has got jam on its
chin," and my innocent and foolish hand promptly went up
to my face to see if, by some wild mischance, it were
jammy.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;the best thing to do now was to fade swiftly
and silently away ere the trap closed; and I turned,
wondering whether Aunt Patricia were watching.</p>

<p>That was an absurd idea, of course.</p>

<p>Then I wondered if the box contained some scent of
indelible odour, which would betray the guilty hand that
had come in contact with it.</p>

<p>Equally absurd.</p>

<p>As I crossed the hall, I also thought of
finger-prints.</p>

<p>Had she polished the lid and front of the box with
the intention of having it examined by experts for the
identification of the owner of the fingers that touched
it during the night? Less absurd, perhaps, but utterly
improbable. Such an idea might have occurred to her had it
been certain that the "Blue Water" was really stolen by a
thief who had meant to get away with it.</p>

<p>And supposing that were really the case, and the jewel
were not replaced during the night?</p>

<p>There were my finger-prints, anyhow, if she had really
thought of this plan! And there they were if it occurred to
her later, in the event of the sapphire not being restored.
I re-entered the central hall&mdash;not more than half
a minute later than I had left it&mdash;and saw someone
coming toward me. He, or she, carried no light, and, of
course, could identify me, the candle being just in front
of my face.</p>

<p>"Well, Gussie," said I. "Cold morning."</p>

<p>"Well, John. Looking for the key?" said the voice of my
brother Michael.</p>

<p>"Yes, Beau," I answered. "It's not there."</p>

<p>"No, John," said Michael quietly. "It's here," and he
held it out towards me.</p>

<p>"<i>Beau!</i>" I said miserably.</p>

<p>"<i>John!</i>" he mocked me.</p>

<p>A wave of sick disgust passed over me. What <i>had</i> come
over my splendid brother?</p>

<p>"Good night," I said, turning away.</p>

<p>"Or morning," replied Michael, and, with a short laugh,
he went into the outer hall.</p>

<p>I heard him strike a match and there followed the rattle
of the key and the clang of a falling lid. He had evidently
thrown the key carelessly into the box, and dropped the lid
without any attempt at avoiding noise.</p>

<p>I went back to bed and, the affair being over and the
mystery solved, fell into a broken sleep.</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">I was awakened at the usual time by David,
the under-footman, with my hot water.</p>

<p>"Half-past seven, sir," said he; "a fine morning when
the mist clears."</p>

<p>"Thank you, David," I replied, and sat up.</p>

<p>What was wrong? Of course&mdash;that idiotic affair of
last night, and Michael's heavy fall from his pedestal.
Well, there are spots on the sun, and no man is always
himself. Why dwell on one fault rather than on a hundred
virtues? But it <i>was</i> unlike Michael to tell such silly
pointless lies to cover a silly pointless trick.</p>

<p>I dressed and went downstairs, taking a mashie and a
ball from the glory-hole, a small room or large cupboard
off the corridor that leads to the smoking-room. I
would do a few approach-shots from the tennis-courts to
the paddock and back, before the breakfast-gong went at
half-past eight.</p>

<p>Crossing the rose-garden I ran into Claudia. This
surprised me, for she was more noted for being the last
arrival at breakfast than for early rising. It struck me
that she looked seedy and worried, and she was certainly
deep in some unpleasant slough of thought when she saw
me.</p>

<p>As she did so, her face cleared and brightened, rather
too suddenly and artificially, I thought.</p>

<p>"Hullo, early worm," said she.</p>

<p>"Hullo, early bird," I replied. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Claudia.</p>

<p>"I thought you looked a bit off colour and bothered,"
replied I, with masculine tactlessness.</p>

<p>"Rubbish," said Claudia, and passed on.</p>

<p>I dropped my ball at the back of the tennis-courts, and
strove in vain to smite it. I scooped generous areas of
turf from the lawn, topped my ball, sliced it into a holly
bush, threw my club after it, and slouched off, my hands
deep in my pockets and anger (with Michael) deep in my
soul.</p>

<p>Returning to the house I saw Burdon crossing the hall,
the gong-stick in his hand. The brass box leered at me
cynically as I passed.</p>

<p>Having washed my hands in the lavatory by the
glory-hole, I went into the dining-room.</p>

<p>The fire was blazing merrily, a silver kettle was
simmering on its spirit-stand on the table, a delicious
smell came from the sideboard, where three or four covered
silver dishes sat on their metal platform, beneath which
burnt spirit-lamps. The huge-room&mdash;with its long
windows, looking on two sides to the loveliest view in
Devon; its great warm-tinted Turkey carpet hiding most of
the ancient oak floor; its beautifully appointed table,
flooded with sunshine; its panelled walls and arched
ceiling&mdash;was a picture of solid, settled comfort,
established and secure.</p>

<p>Digby was wandering about the room, a plate of porridge
in one hand, and a busy spoon in the other. Augustus was
at the sideboard removing cover after cover, and adding
sausages to eggs and rashers of bacon.</p>

<p>"Good effort, Gus," said Digby, eyeing the piled mass as
he passed him with his empty porridge plate. "Shove some
kedgeree on top."</p>

<p>"Had it," said Augustus. "This is going on top of the
kedgeree."</p>

<p>"Stout citizen," approved Digby, getting himself a clean
plate.</p>

<p>Isobel was sitting in her place, and I went to see what
I could get for her.</p>

<p>As I stood by her chair she put her left hand up to mine
and gave it a squeeze.</p>

<p>"I'll wait for Aunt Patricia, John," she said.</p>

<p>Michael came in.</p>

<p>"Aunt come down?" he asked, and added a belated
"'Morning, everybody."</p>

<p>"No," replied Digby. "Watch me gobble and go. I'm not
meeting Aunt till the day's been aired a bit."</p>

<p>"Claudia down yet?" enquired Michael, ignoring him.</p>

<p>"I saw her in the garden," I said.</p>

<p>"I'll tell her breakfast's ready," he observed, rising
and going out.</p>

<p>"Take her a kidney on a fork," shouted Digby, as the
door closed.</p>

<p>We sat down, and conversation was in abeyance for a few
minutes in favour of the business of breakfast.</p>

<p>"I suppose the Crown Jewels are all present and correct
by now?" said Digby suddenly, voicing what was uppermost in
all our thoughts. "Door's still locked. I tried it."</p>

<p>"Of course it's all right," I said.</p>

<p>"Seen it?" asked Augustus.</p>

<p>"Or was it too dark?" he added, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I haven't seen it," I replied. "But of course,
it's there all right."</p>

<p>"You should know, of course," said Augustus.</p>

<p>"Shut it, Ghastly," said Digby, "or I'll have your
breakfast back."</p>

<p>"You're a coarse lout, Digby," remarked Augustus
calmly.</p>

<p>"'Streuth!" murmured Digby to the world in general.
"Isn't the gentleman's courage coming on?"</p>

<p>It struck me that it was. I had never known Augustus so
daring, assured, and insolent before. I felt more and more
convinced that, as Michael had said, nothing but genuine
injured innocence and a sense of injustice could have
wrought this change.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Claudia, followed by Michael,
entered. She looked very white and Michael very wooden and
<i>boutonné.</i> I saw Isobel give her a sharp glance as she sat
down and said:</p>

<p>"'Morning... Aunt not been down yet?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Gobble and go. If asked about sapphires, say
you don't know," chanted Digby, beating time with a spoon
on his cup.</p>

<p>Michael foraged at the sideboard for Claudia, and
then went to the coffee-table. I watched his face as
he took the coffee-pot and milk-jug from their tray and
held them poised one in each hand, over the cup. His
face was perfectly inscrutable and his hands absolutely
steady&mdash;but I knew there was something very wrong.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw me watching him.</p>

<p>"'Morning, bun-face," quoth he. "Sleep well?"</p>

<p>"Except for one unpleasant dream, Beau," I replied.</p>

<p>"H'm," said Michael, and I tried to analyse the sound,
but found it as non-committal as his face.</p>

<p>He returned to his place beside Claudia, and as he
seated himself, Aunt Patricia entered the room.</p>

<p>We rose, and I drew back her chair, and then we stood
petrified in a complete silence.</p>

<p>One look at her face was sufficient, as she stopped
halfway from the door. I knew before she spoke almost the
words she was going to say.</p>

<p>"I have come to request that none of you&mdash;<i>none</i> of
you&mdash;leave the house to-day," she said. "Unless, that
is, one of you cares to say, even now at the eleventh hour,
'A fool and a liar I am, but a criminal I am not!'"</p>

<p>No one spoke or moved. I looked at Michael and he at
me.</p>

<p>"No?" continued Lady Brandon. "Very well. But please
understand that if I go out of this room without the 'Blue
Water,' I will have no mercy. The thief shall pay a thief's
penalty&mdash;<i>whoever</i> it may be."</p>

<p>She paused and fixed her coldly angry gaze on me, on
Augustus, on Michael, on Digby, on Isobel, on Claudia.</p>

<p>No one spoke or moved, and for a full minute Lady
Brandon waited.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said she at last, and then, "One other thing
please note very carefully. The servants know <i>nothing</i>
of this, and they are to know nothing. We will keep it to
ourselves&mdash;as long as possible, of course&mdash;that
one of you six is a treacherous, ungrateful, lying
thief."</p>

<p>And then Michael spoke:</p>

<p>"Say one of us four, please, Aunt Patricia."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Michael," she replied cuttingly. "You four
are among the six. And I will apply to you when I need the
help of your wisdom in choosing my words."</p>

<p>"I think you might say '<i>one of you three brothers,</i>'"
Augustus had the audacity to remark.</p>

<p>"Hold your miserable tongue," was Lady Brandon's
discouraging reply.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," she continued, "the servants are to
know nothing&mdash;and neither is anybody else. Until, of
course, the police-court reporters have the story, and the
newspapers are adorned with the portrait of one of your
faces."</p>

<p>Once again her scornful glance swept us in turn, this
time beginning with Michael and going on to Augustus.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," she went on. "No one leaves the
house, and no one breathes a word of this to anyone but the
eight people who already know of it..."</p>

<p>"Except to a detective or the police, of course," she
added, with an ominous note and a disdainful edge to her
voice. "The Chaplain is ill," she concluded, "and I don't
wonder at it."</p>

<p>She turned and walked to the door. Before opening it,
she faced us once again.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say&mdash;Michael?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Leave the girls out of it&mdash;and Augustus," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say, Digby?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt. Awful sorry, and all that," replied Digby,
and I seemed to see his lips forming the words, "No, no.
Gobble and go...."</p>

<p>"John?" and she looked even more disdainful, I
thought.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt&mdash;except that I agree with Michael, <i>very</i>
strongly," I answered.</p>

<p>"Augustus?"</p>

<p>"It's a damned shame..." blustered Augustus.</p>

<p>"Very helpful," Lady Brandon cut him short with cruel
contempt.</p>

<p>"Claudia?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt."</p>

<p>"Isobel?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt," answered Isobel. "But please, please wait
another day and..."</p>

<p>"... And give the thief time to dispose of it, were you
going to say?" interrupted Aunt Patricia.</p>

<p>She opened the door.</p>

<p>"Then that is all, is it?" she asked. "No one has
anything to say?... <i>Very well!</i>" and she went out, closing
the door quietly behind her.</p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p class="first">"I hate skilly and loathe picking oakum,
don't you, Ghastly?" remarked Digby conversationally, as we
stared at each other in utter consternation.</p>

<p>"You foul, filthy, utter cads," spluttered Augustus,
looking from Digby to me and then to Michael.</p>

<p>"Cuts no ice, Gus. Shut it," said Michael, in a
perfectly friendly voice, and added, "Run along and play if
you can't be serious.... Come with me, John," and turning
to the girls, said, "Do me a favour, Queen Claudia and
Faithful Hound."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Isobel.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Claudia.</p>

<p>"Put this wretched business out of both your minds, by
means of my absolute assurance and solemn promise that it
will be settled and cleared up to-day."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Claudia.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Michael,</i> dear!" said Isobel, and glanced at
me.</p>

<p>"Never mind how, for the minute, Claudia," replied
Michael. "Just believe and rest assured. Before you go to
bed to-night, everything will be as clear as crystal."</p>

<p>"Or as blue as sapphire," said Digby, and added, "By
Jove! I've got an idea! A theory!... My dog Joss got
alarmed at the sudden darkness, jumped on a chair to
avoid the crush, wagged his tail to show faith and hope,
knocked over the cover, reversed his engine, and smelt
round to see what he'd done, found nothing and yawned in
boredom&mdash;and inhaled the 'Blue Water.'"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was thirsty and <i>drank</i> the 'Blue Water'?"
amended Isobel.</p>

<p>"Both very sound theories. Sounder still if Joss had
been in the room," said Michael. "Come, John."</p>

<p>I followed my brother out into the hall. He led the way
to his room.</p>

<p>"Take a pew, Johnny. I would hold converse with thee on
certain dark matters," he said as we entered.</p>

<p>Having locked the door, he put his tobacco-jar on
the low table beside the low arm-chair in which I was
sitting.</p>

<p>"You leave the carbon cake too long in your pipes," he
said. "That's what cracks them. Unequal expansion of the
carbon and the wood, I suppose. You ought to scrape it out
once a month or so."</p>

<p>He seated himself opposite to me and sprawled in the low
chair, with his knees higher than his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like a well-caked pipe," I replied. "Nuttier and
cooler."</p>

<p>"Ah, well! So long as you can afford to crack your
pipes," he said lazily, and sat silent for a minute or
two.</p>

<p>I was quite under his spell again, and had to keep
whipping my feelings up into a state of resentment and
disgust to maintain them in the condition that common
justice demanded. If he were going to restore the sapphire
that evening as he had hinted, why on earth couldn't he
have done it just now? For the matter of that, why on earth
couldn't he have returned it last night when he went to the
drawing-room? Why had he ever denied taking the thing at
all?</p>

<p>"Well, son, what about it?" he said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, what about it, Beau?" I replied.</p>

<p>He looked at me quizzically.</p>

<p>"What's the game, should you think, Johnny?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"That's what I want to know," I answered. "It seems a
damned silly one, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Quite," agreed Michael. "Quite very. <i>Very</i>
quite. <i>And</i> a little rough on the girls and our good
Augustus."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said I. "And on Aunt Patricia."</p>

<p>An uncomfortable silence followed.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Michael, at length.</p>

<p>"Oh, put it back, Beau," I implored. "God alone knows
what you're playing at! Do <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>Michael sat up and stared at me.</p>

<p>"Oh? You say '<i>Put it back,</i>' do you, John?" he said
slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I do," I replied. "Or look here, Beau. Aunt thinks a
lot of you, and devilish little of me. It would be doing
her a real kindness not to let her know it was you after
all. Give it here, and I'll..." I coloured and felt a
fool.</p>

<p>"<i>Eric, or Little by Little. A Story of School Life....
The Boy with the Marble Brow,</i>" murmured Michael, smiling.
But his voice was very kind....</p>

<p>"This grows interesting, Johnny," he went on. "If I go
and fetch the 'Blue Water' now, will you take it to Aunt
Patricia and say, '<i>Alone I did it. I cannot tell a lie. It
is a far, far better thing I do...?</i>"</p>

<p>"Those very words, Beau," I grinned. "On condition you
tell me what the game was, and why you did such a damned
silly thing."</p>

<p>Thank God the wretched business was going to
end&mdash;and yet, and yet... I felt quite sure that
Michael would not let me take the blame&mdash;much as I
would have preferred that to the wretched feeling of our
Michael being the object of Aunt Patricia's scorn and
contempt. The more she liked him and approved him now, the
more would she dislike and despise him then. She might
forbid him the house.</p>

<p>Michael rose.</p>

<p>"You really will?" he asked. "If I go and get it now,
you'll take it straight to Aunt Patricia and say you
pinched it for a lark?"</p>

<p>"Only too glad of the chance, Beau," I answered.
"To get the beastly business over and done with and
forgotten&mdash;and the girls and Gussie and Digby out of
the silly mess."</p>

<p>"H'm," said Michael, sitting down. "You would, eh!"</p>

<p>"And might I ask you a question or two, John?" he went
on.</p>

<p>"What were you doing with your hand on the glass cover
when I put my hand on it last night?"</p>

<p>"Waiting to catch the ass that was returning the 'Blue
Water,'" I replied.</p>

<p>"H'm! Why did you want to catch him?"</p>

<p>"Because I had twice been accused of the fool
trick&mdash;just because I was standing close to the table
when the light failed."</p>

<p>"So you were, too.... And what were you doing downstairs
last night when I found you in the hall?"</p>

<p>"Looking for the key, Beau, as I told you," I
answered.</p>

<p>"And what did you want the key for?"</p>

<p>"To see whether the sapphire had been put back&mdash;and
to get some peace of mind and sleep, if it had."</p>

<p>"Did you go into the drawing-room?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"What need! I took it for granted that you had returned
it," replied I.</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Michael. "Suppose a vote were taken among
the eight of us, as to who is likeliest to be the thief,
who do you suppose would top the poll?"</p>

<p>"Augustus," I stated promptly.</p>

<p>"Do you think he is the culprit?" asked my brother.</p>

<p>"No, I do <i>not,</i>" I replied significantly.</p>

<p>"Nor I," answered the enigmatic Michael. "In fact, I
know he's not."</p>

<p>He sat silent, smoking reflectively for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"Go through the list," he said suddenly. "Would Aunt
pinch her own jewel?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," said I.</p>

<p>"Would the Chaplain?"</p>

<p>"Still less," said I.</p>

<p>"Would Claudia?" he asked next&mdash;almost anxiously, I
fancied (absurdly, no doubt).</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," I replied.</p>

<p>"Would Isobel?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a cad," I said.</p>

<p>"Would Digby?"</p>

<p>"Utterly preposterous and absurd," I answered.</p>

<p>"Would Augustus?"</p>

<p>"I feel certain that he <i>didn't</i> anyhow," I answered.</p>

<p>"Would you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't, as it happens," I assured him.</p>

<p>"Would I?"</p>

<p>"I should have thought you almost the last person in the
world, Beau," I assured him.</p>

<p>"Looks as though I did it, then, doesn't it?" he
asked. "Because if Augustus and Digby and you didn't do
it&mdash;who the devil did, if I didn't? Yes&mdash; it
looks as though I am the thief."</p>

<p>"It does&mdash;to me only though. Nobody else knows that
I found you downstairs," I said. "Why <i>didn't</i> you put it
back then, Beau?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Wish I had,</i>" he said.</p>

<p>There came a bang at the door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" cried Michael.</p>

<p>"Me," bawled the ungrammatical Digby.</p>

<p>Michael unlocked the door.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Isobel wants to speak to us three. She's been looking
for you two. A thought has struck her. Blow severe but not
fatal. All about the Painful Event...."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"I said I'd lead you by the ear to the smoking-room at
an early date&mdash; unless either of you had done a bunk
with the loot," replied Digby.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I haven't fled yet, but I shall want a
Bradshaw after lunch," said Michael, adding, "Let's go and
hear Isobel's great thought. Generally worth hearing."</p>

<p>We went downstairs and made our way to the smoking-room.
The brass box caught my eye, and an idea also struck me
with some violence, as I noticed that the lid and front
seemed brighter than the rest of it.</p>

<p>"Don't expose me yet, John," said Michael as we crossed
the hall.</p>

<p>"John been catching you out?" asked Digby.</p>

<p>"Caught me last night, didn't you, John?" replied
Michael.</p>

<p>"Red-handed," said I.</p>

<p>"It's blue-handed that Aunt wants to cop someone,"
said Digby, opening the door of the smoking-room.
"Sapphire-blue."</p>

<p>Isobel was sitting by the fire looking tearful and
depressed. It was at me that she looked as we entered.</p>

<p>"Caught them both in the act of bolting, Isobel,"
said Digby. "They've each got a half of the 'Blue
Water'&mdash;about a pint apiece. But they are willing to
hear your words if you are quick."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> so miserable," moaned Isobel. "I have been
such a wicked, <i>wicked</i> beast. But I can't bear it any
longer."</p>

<p>"Leave it with us, dear," said Digby, "and forget it.
We'll smuggle it back, and share Aunt's few well-chosen
words among us, won't we, Beau?"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, child?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"I've let Augustus take the blame all this time," she
sobbed.</p>

<p>"Didn't notice him taking any," observed Digby. "Must be
a secret blame-taker, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Augustus is perfectly innocent and I could have proved
it, the moment Aunt began to question us last night. A word
from me would have saved him from all suspicion&mdash;and I
never said it," she went on.</p>

<p>"Why, dear?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know.... Yes, I do. It would have looked
like exculpating myself too," she replied. "Besides, I
didn't know <i>who</i> had done it. And it was more or less of
a silly practical joke last night.... And, of course, I
thought the person who had taken it would say so, or at
least put it back. But now&mdash;it's awful. And I can't
keep quiet any longer, I thought I'd tell you three before
I told Aunt."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what is it, Faithful Hound?" asked
Michael.</p>

<p>"Why, when the light went out&mdash;you know I said,
'<i>Ghosts and goblins and skeleton hands,</i>' or something!
Well, I half frightened myself and half pretended, and I
clutched somebody's arm. When the light went up I found it
was Augustus I was hugging&mdash;and let go so quickly that
nobody noticed, I suppose."</p>

<p>"That settles it," said Digby. "It wasn't poor Gussie."
"Couldn't have been," he added, "unless those two were one
and did it together."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Dig," I said, for poor Isobel was
really upset about it.</p>

<p>"Oh, never!" said Digby. "Absolutely never!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I like our Augustus all the better for not
having adduced this bit of evidence himself," said I.</p>

<p>"Bless the dear boy," said Digby, "and I searched all
his little pockets. I must find him and forgive him."</p>

<p>"Have you told Claudia this?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Isobel. "But she seems to think that I
may have been mistaken."</p>

<p>"Which is absurd, of course," she added.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;friend Gussie ought to be much obliged
to you, both for hanging on to him in the dark, and for
remembering it, Isobel," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Yes," chimed in Digby, "now he can bark and wag his
tail and gambol around the feet of Aunt Patricia, while we
walk in outer darkness."</p>

<p>"Tell her at once and get it off your conscientious
chest, Isobel," said I.</p>

<p>She looked at me long and miserably, almost
apologetically I thought, and went out of the room.</p>

<p>"Say, citizens," said Digby as the door closed, "what
I want to know is this. Who pinched this here gem we're
being bothered about? Officious and offensive fella, I
consider&mdash;but Gussie now being out of it, it must
be one of us three.... Excuse my mentioning it then, but
me being out of it, it must be one of you <i>two.</i> Now
unless you really want the damned thing, I say, '<i>Put it
back.</i>'"</p>

<p>Michael and I once again looked at each other, Michael's
face being perfectly expressionless.</p>

<p>"I think of bolting with it, as I told Isobel just now,"
said Michael.</p>

<p>"John going with his half too?" asked Digby.</p>

<p>"No," replied Michael for me. "I'm taking it all."</p>

<p>"Well, old horse," said Digby, looking at his watch,
"could you go soon after lunch? I want to run up to town to
see a man about a dog, and Aunt seems to have other views
for us&mdash;until the matter is cleared up."</p>

<p>"Do my best to oblige," said Michael, as I quietly
slipped from the room to carry out the idea which had
occurred to me as I crossed the hall.</p>

<p>I went to the brass box. Finger-prints were very faintly
discernible on its highly-polished lid and front. Going to
the wash-basin in the room opening off the neighbouring
corridor, I damped my handkerchief, and rubbed soap,
hard, on the wet surface. The hall was still empty when I
returned, and I promptly began scouring the lid and front
of the box.</p>

<p>It was easier, however, to remove the finger-marks than
to remove the signs of their removal. I did not wish it to
be obvious that someone had been doing&mdash;what I was
doing.</p>

<p>Under a heavy curtain, in a recess in the panelling,
hung overcoats, caps, mufflers, and such outdoor garments.
A silk scarf of Digby's struck me as being just the thing I
wanted.</p>

<p>I had restored to the box the brilliance which had been
its before I soaped it, and was giving it a final wipe
with the silk, when the door from the corridor swung open,
Michael entered, and I was caught in the act.</p>

<p>And then I saw that in his hand was a piece of
wash-leather and a silver-duster, presumably purloined
from the butler's pantry!</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said. "Removing all traces of the crime?"</p>

<p>"All&mdash;I hope, Beau," I replied.</p>

<p>"Sound plan too," he observed. "Just going to do it
myself," and he passed on.</p>

<p>Having finished my task, I placed the fingers of my
right hand on top of the box, my thumb on the front, and
left as fair and clear a set of finger-prints as I could
contrive.</p>

<p>How could it possibly matter to me if a detective
identified them as mine? I hadn't taken the "Blue Water,"
and nobody could prove that I had.</p>

<p>And why was Michael so anxious that his finger-marks
should not be found there as a piece of evidence to be
coupled with the fact that I had been seen holding his
wrist, above the glass cover, when the lights were turned
on?</p>

<p>I went up to my room despairing, and trying to recall
what I had read, somewhere, about the method of examining
finger-prints. I believe they blow a fine powder on to them
and then apply carbon-paper or tissue-paper, and take a
photograph of the result.</p>

<p>Anyhow, if Aunt had been wily enough to polish the box,
just where we would touch it, so that she could get the
fingerprints of the person who opened it, she'd get mine
all right and those of nobody else, when the detectives
came.</p>

<h3>§ 8</h3>

<p class="first">Aunt Patricia did not appear at lunch, nor
did Claudia. The Chaplain was still ill in bed.</p>

<p>As Burdon and a footman always waited at that meal,
there was no general conversation on the one subject of
interest to us all.</p>

<p>It was a painful meal, to me at any rate, though Digby
seemed perfectly happy, and Michael unconcerned. The only
reference to the theft was during a brief absence of the
servants.</p>

<p>"Did you tell Aunt what you proposed to tell her? What
did she say?" asked Michael of Isobel.</p>

<p>"Yes.... She said, somewhat cryptically, '<i>Virtue is its
own reward,</i>' and nothing else," replied Isobel.</p>

<p>"Gussie," said Digby, "Isobel has&mdash;one cannot say
'bearded' of a lady&mdash; let us say faced&mdash;Aunt
Patricia in her wrath, in order to tell her that you must
be absolutely innocent of sin, and quite above or beneath
suspicion."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" snarled Augustus.</p>

<p>"She very kindly went to the lioness's den," continued
Digby, "to say that she seized you and hung on to you last
night while the lights were out&mdash; and that, therefore,
you could not possibly have gone to the table and pinched
the sapphire, as she was hanging on to your arm. I
sincerely apologise to you, Gussie, and hope you'll forgive
me."</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> arm?" said Augustus, in deep and genuine
surprise, ignoring the apology, and quickly adding, "Oh,
yes&mdash;er&mdash;of course. Thanks, Isobel."</p>

<p>We all looked at him. I had been watching him when he
spoke, and to me his surprise was perfectly obvious.</p>

<p>"Then Aunt knows <i>I</i> didn't do it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gussie," Isobel assured him, "and I'm <i>awfully</i>
sorry I didn't say it, at once, last night."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I thought you <i>might</i> have done so," replied
our Augustus.</p>

<p>"Isobel is not so keen on exculpating herself too, you
see," said I, glaring at the creature. "<i>If</i> she were
holding your arm, she could not have gone to the table
herself. Proving your innocence proves her own."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;she might have thought of me," he
grumbled.</p>

<p>"She has, Gussie," said Michael; "we shall all think of
you, I'm sure.... Anyhow, we are all sorry we were unkind
and suspicious."</p>

<p>"Suspicious! <i>You!</i>" said Augustus. "Huh!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and I'm sorry I searched you, Ghastly," put
in Digby.... "I'll unsearch you by and by, if you're not
careful," he added.</p>

<p>And then David and Burdon came in with the next
course.</p>

<p>After lunch, feeling disgruntled and miserable, I went
along to the billiard-room to knock the balls about, as
one could not very well leave the house in face of Lady
Brandon's request.</p>

<p>Augustus was before me and I turned to retreat. I was in
no mood to suffer Augustus gladly.</p>

<p>"Police come yet?" he jeered.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you're safe for the present," I replied.</p>

<p>"You heard what Isobel said at lunch," he squealed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, going out, "you could hardly believe
your ears, could you?" and I am afraid that the anger
that I felt was almost entirely due to my conviction that
he was absolutely innocent. Isobel could not very well
be mistaken. I supposed that Augustus must have quite
forgotten the incident until Isobel mentioned it, or else
had never noticed it at all. Certainly that was far more
probable, than that Isobel had made a mistake as to whom
she had clutched in the darkness, especially as she did
not leave go until the lights came on and started us all
blinking at each other.</p>

<p>I went up to my bedroom, feeling deadly tired after my
wakeful night and all the worry, and threw myself on my
bed.</p>

<p>I was awakened from a heavy sleep by the entrance of
Digby, a couple of hours later. He held a letter in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Hi, hog," quoth he, "wake up and listen.... Latest
edition," and he sat himself down heavily on the foot of
the bed.</p>

<p>"What's up now?" I yawned, rubbing my eyes.</p>

<p>"We've got to use our wits and do something to help
Beau. Show the mettle of our pastures and all that....
Beau's done a bunk. Left this note with David. Says he
pinched the 'Blue Water,' and isn't going to face the
police."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" I cried.</p>

<p>"Read it," said Digby, and passed the letter to me.</p>

<br>


<p class="quote"><i>My dear Dig,</i> it ran,</p>

<p class="letter">I have told David to give you
this at four o'clock, by which time I shall be well on my
way to&mdash;where I am going. Will you please tell Aunt
that there is no further need to chivvy any of you about
the "Blue Water." If the police come or a mystery-merchant
from Scotland Yard, tell them that you knew that I was in
sore straights&mdash;or is it straits (or crookeds?) for
money, but that you think that this is my first offence and
I must have been led away by bad companions (you and John,
of course). Keep an eye on young John, and tell him I
hope he'll be a good boy. If I send you an address later,
it will be in absolute confidence, and relying wholly on
your utterly refusing to give it to <u>anybody</u> for any
reason whatsoever. I do hope that things will settle down
quickly and quietly, now that the criminal is known. Sad,
sad, sad! Give my love to Claudia.</p>

<p class="letter">Ever thine,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Michael</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>"It <i>can't</i> be true," I said. "It's impossible."</p>

<p>"Of course it is, fat-head," replied Digby. "He's off
on the romantic tack. Taking the blame and all that....
Shielding his little brother...."</p>

<p>"Which?" I asked. "You!"</p>

<p>"No," said Digby.</p>

<p>"Me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Subtle mathematician," observed Digby.</p>

<p>"But I didn't do it," I said.</p>

<p>"Nor did I," said Digby, and added, "Let's say 'Taking
the blame and <i>thinking</i> he's shielding his little brother'
then."</p>

<p>"But, Dig," I expostulated, "do you think Beau
seriously supposes for one moment that you or I would
steal a valuable jewel&mdash;and from Aunt Patricia of all
people?"</p>

<p>"Somebody has stolen it, haven't they?" said Digby. "And
I tell you what, my lad," he added; "you say that Beau
would never seriously suppose that you or I would steal
it&mdash;but you yourself seriously supposed that Beau
had!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?" I asked, aghast.</p>

<p>"By the way you looked at him&mdash;oh, half a dozen
times."</p>

<p>"I had reason to suspect him," I said.</p>

<p>"What reason&mdash;except that you caught hold of his
wrist in the dark, when he was probably doing just what you
were doing, trying to catch Gussie in the act of putting it
back?" asked Digby.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not say any more about it, Dig," I replied.
"It's Beau's business after all, and..."</p>

<p>"Don't be a colossal ass," interrupted Digby. "Of course
it's Beau's business, and that's what we are talking
about. The more we both know, the more we can both help
him&mdash;either to get away, or to come back.... If we
knew he is guilty, which, of course, he isn't, we could
draw red herrings across his trail; and if we knew he is
innocent, which he is, we could lay for the real thief and
catch him out."</p>

<p>"Beau doesn't want him caught out, evidently," said
I.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;not if it's the miserable Gussie?" asked my
brother indignantly.</p>

<p>"It isn't," said I. "And Beau knows it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;let's have those reasons, and we'll get to
work," said Digby. "You needn't feel as though you were
giving Beau away. There is no more harm in my knowing than
in your knowing, and there may be some good. I am not
asking you to tell Aunt, or the police, am I, bun-head?"</p>

<p>This was true enough. No harm could result from Digby's
knowing all that I knew.</p>

<p>Moreover, if, as Digby assumed, Michael were shielding
somebody else, presumably he would welcome any evidence
that strengthened the case against himself.</p>

<p>"Well," said I reluctantly, "it's like this, Dig....
Beau went down to the drawing-room last night. I met him
with the key in his hand..."</p>

<p>"And what were <i>you</i> doing, if one might ask?"
interrupted my brother.</p>

<p>"Going to see if the 'Blue Water' had been returned," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, <i>Beau</i> hadn't returned it, had he?" grinned
Digby.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but at the time I, naturally enough, thought
he had," said I, "and I suppose that fixed the idea in
my mind. I first got the idea&mdash;naturally enough,
again&mdash;when I caught his hand hovering over the glass
cover in the darkness."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" asked Digby.</p>

<p>"Yes, the third reason I had for suspecting
Beau&mdash;though I put my faith in him before all
reason&mdash;was that I found him going to the brass box
with a leather and duster to rub out the finger-prints he
had made in taking and returning the key."</p>

<p>Digby whistled.</p>

<p>"Ingenious," he murmured. "As artful as our Auntie,
if she had the idea.... Detectives would have the idea
anyhow."</p>

<p>"I think she did have the idea," I said. "I believe
she went straight from the drawing-room and polished all
the finger-marks from the lid and front of the damned
thing."</p>

<p>"And how do you know that Beau was on to the dodge?"
asked Digby.</p>

<p>"He said so. He came into the hall with the
cleaning-things in his hand, just as I was doing it
myself."</p>

<p>Digby stared.</p>

<p>"Doing it yourself?" he said. "<i>Why?</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, can't you see?" I groaned. "<i>If</i> Beau had been
playing the wild ass, I didn't want his finger-prints to
be found there, on top of the fact that I had been seen
clutching his fist in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Yours were there as well as his," observed Digby, "if
you went to the box for the key."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;they were," said I, "and they are there,
alone, now."</p>

<p>"Stout fella," approved Digby. "I'll go and shove mine
on too, and fog the Sherlocks.... But you really are a
goat," he went on. "Don't you see that Beau was probably
going to do precisely what <i>you</i> were doing? He was going
to polish the beastly thing clean of all foot-marks, and
then jab his own on."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To shield the real culprit, of course," said Digby
patiently.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but <i>why?</i>" I repeated. "Why should Beau be a
gratuitous ass and take the blame instead of&mdash;Gussie,
for example? He'd have been more likely to nose him out and
then slipper him well."</p>

<p>"Because he knew it wasn't Gussie," replied my brother
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Who then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He didn't know," answered Digby. "But isn't it as clear
as mud, that since it wasn't Gussie or Isobel, it was you
or me&mdash;or else <i>Claudia?</i>"</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>"Now look here, John," went on Digby. "'Nuff said, and
time to do something instead. But first of all, do you
still suspect Beau?"</p>

<p>"I have never suspected him," I replied. "I have
only realised that I caught his hand, met him with
the drawing-room key, and know he was going to rub
finger-prints off the brass box."</p>

<p>"Plain yes or no," said Digby. "Do you suspect Beau?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely not," I said promptly. "No. No. <i>No!</i>"</p>

<p>"Very good then. Now&mdash;Did <i>you</i> do it?"</p>

<p>"I did not," said I.</p>

<p>"Nor did I. Very well! Since Isobel and Augustus
mutually prove each other innocent, as she was holding
his arm, yards from the table all the time&mdash; who is
left?"</p>

<p>"<i>Claudia?</i>" said I unhappily.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> d'you get it?" smiled Digby, leaning back against
the bottom of the bed, and clasping his hands round his
knee.</p>

<p>"Good God, man," I cried, starting up. "You don't mean
to tell me you suspect <i>Claudia</i> of jewel-stealing?"</p>

<p>"Keep calm," he replied. "I am not talking about whom
I suspect. I am asking you who remains if you eliminate
me and yourself as admittedly innocent, and Isobel and
Augustus as proven innocent."</p>

<p>"Michael and Claudia!" I murmured. "Which idea is the
more ridiculous?" I said aloud.</p>

<p>"Equally impossible," answered Digby. "Also the fact
remains that it was one of those two&mdash;<i>if</i> it
wasn't you. Furthermore, the fact remains that Michael
has bolted for one of two reasons&mdash;because he is a
frightened thief, or because he wished to shield the guilty
person&mdash;you or Claudia."</p>

<p>A silence fell between us.</p>

<p>"I'm going dotty," said I at last.</p>

<p>"I've gone," said Digby, and we sat staring at each
other. After a time he rose.</p>

<p>"Got to get a move on," he said.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Dunno," he replied.</p>

<p>As he was leaving the room I said, "Do you think Michael
suspects either me or you, Digby?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "He <i>knows</i> we didn't do it."</p>

<p>"Do you think he suspects Claudia then?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;<i>no</i>&mdash;of course not," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>"He only <i>knows</i> that one of us three <i>did</i> do it," he
replied, and went out, leaving me staring at the door.</p>

<p>I lay down again to think.</p>

<h3>§ 9</h3>

<p class="first">Dinner that night was an extraordinary
meal, at which only Isobel, Claudia, Augustus, and I
appeared.</p>

<p>Lady Brandon, said Burdon, was dining in her own room;
his Reverence the Chaplain was, by Dr. Warrender's orders,
remaining in bed; Mr. Michael was not in his room when
David took up his hot water; and Mr. Digby had been seen
going down the drive soon after tea.</p>

<p>"Shocking bad form, I call it&mdash;Michael and Digby
going out like this&mdash; after what Aunt said," remarked
Augustus as the service-door swung to, when the servants
went out for the coffee.</p>

<p>"You're an authority on good form, of course," I
said.</p>

<p>"Where has Beau gone?" asked Claudia.</p>

<p>"He didn't tell me," I replied.</p>

<p>"Don't suppose he told anybody," sneered Augustus.</p>

<p>"Come into the drawing-room soon," said Isobel, as I
held the dining-room door open for the girls to go out.</p>

<p>"I'm coming now," I replied. "As soon as I have had some
coffee."</p>

<p>I did not want a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Augustus, and I was
more than a little disturbed in mind as to the meaning of
Digby's absence.</p>

<p>What could be the reason of his defiance of Aunt
Patricia's prohibition of our leaving the house? Was it
possible that he knew more than he had told me?</p>

<p>Perhaps he had gone to the village telegraph-office to
try to get into communication with Michael at one of the
several places to which he might have gone.</p>

<p>It would be something important that would make him risk
giving Aunt Patricia cause to think that he had been guilty
of an ungentlemanly disobedience to her request.</p>

<p>I drank my coffee in silence, and in silence departed
from the room. I could not forgive Gussie for being
innocent and forcing Michael to suspect Claudia, Digby, or
me; me to suspect Claudia, Digby, or Michael; and Digby to
suspect Claudia, Michael, or me.</p>

<p>Most unjust of me, but most human, I fear.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room Isobel was at the piano, playing
softly to herself, and Claudia sat staring into the
fire.</p>

<p>I strolled over to the huge piano and sat down near
it.</p>

<p>"Where <i>can</i> Michael be?" said Claudia.</p>

<p>"And Digby," added Isobel.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said I.</p>

<p>"Really and truly?" asked Claudia.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "I honestly have not the faintest idea as
to where either of them is."</p>

<p>"I wish they'd come in," said Isobel.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't bear this room," cried Claudia suddenly,
and springing up, went out. As I opened the door for her,
I fancied I caught a glimpse of tears on her half-averted
face, though I was not prying.</p>

<p>As I closed the door, Isobel rose from the piano and
came towards me. She looked very lovely I thought, with her
misty blue eyes, misty golden hair, as fine as floss-silk,
and her sweet expression. How gentle and dear she was!</p>

<p>"Johnny," she said, laying her hands on my chest and
looking up into my eyes, "may I ask you a silly question?
Just once and for all? I know the answer, but I want to
hear you say it."</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear," said I.</p>

<p>"You won't be angry, Johnny!"</p>

<p>"Have I ever been angry with you, Isobel? Could I be?" I
asked.</p>

<p>She looked into my eyes steadily for a few moments.</p>

<p>"<i>Did you take the</i> '<i>Blue Water,</i>' <i>John?</i>" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, I did not," I replied, and drew her to me.
And then Isobel threw her arms round my neck and I kissed
her on the lips.</p>

<p>She burst into tears, and lifting her up in my arms, I
carried her to a sofa and sat hugging her to my breast and
covering her face with kisses. It had suddenly come upon
me that I loved her&mdash;that I had always loved her. But
hitherto it had been as a charming darling playmate and
companion, and now it was as a woman.</p>

<p>If this knowledge between us were a result of the theft
of the "Blue Water," I was glad it had been stolen.</p>

<p>"Darling! Darling! Darling!" I whispered as I kissed
her. "Do you love me, darling Isobel?" I asked, and, for
reply, she smiled starrily through her tears, put her arms
round me, and pressed her lips to mine.</p>

<p>I thought my heart was stopping.</p>

<p>"<i>Love</i> you, dearest?" she asked. "You are just my life.
I have loved everything you have said or done, since I was
a baby!"</p>

<p>"Don't cry," I said, ashamed of my inarticulate
inadequacy.</p>

<p>"I'm crying for joy," she sobbed. "Now you have told
<i>me</i> you didn't do it, I know you didn't."</p>

<p>"What made you think I did?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I <i>didn't</i> think so," she replied with feminine logic;
"only it was you who were against the table, John; it was
you whom Michael caught; and I saw you go down in the
night&mdash;to put it back, as I thought."</p>

<p>"Saw me?" I asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. I was awake and saw a light go by my door.
It shone underneath it. And I came out and looked over the
banisters."</p>

<p>"I went to see if the wretched thing had come back," I
said. "And it was rather I who caught Michael than Michael
who caught me, when you turned the lights out. We were both
expecting to catch Gussie, and caught each other."</p>

<p>"And, oh, I have been so wretchedly unhappy," she went
on, "thinking appearances were so against you, and yet
knowing I was allowing Gussie to remain under suspicion
when I knew it wasn't he.... But when it seemed the thing
was actually stolen, I couldn't keep quiet any longer.
It was bad enough when it was only a practical joke, as
we thought.... And then I seemed to be helping to bring
suspicion towards you when I cleared Gussie...."</p>

<p>She wiped away a tear.</p>

<p>"I don't care now," she smiled. "Nothing on earth
matters. So long as you love me&mdash;I don't see how I can
have a care in the world.... You're <i>sure,</i> darling?"</p>

<p>I endeavoured to express myself without the use of
halting and unfluent speech.</p>

<p>"When did you first love me?" asked my sweet and
beautiful darling, when I released her.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said. "I have always loved you, and
now I worship you, and I always shall," and again she gave
me a long embrace that seemed to stop the beating of my
heart and lift me up and up to an incredible heaven of
ecstasy and joy almost unbearable.</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps and a hand on the door brought
us back to earth. We sprang to our feet, and when David
entered, Isobel was putting away her music, and I was
consulting a small pocket-book with terrific abstraction
from my surroundings.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said David, halting before me. "Might
I speak to you, sir?"</p>

<p>"You're doing it, David," said I.</p>

<p>"In private, sir, a moment," he explained.</p>

<p>I went to the door with him, and having closed it, he
produced a note and gave it to me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Digby, sir. He very specially instructed me to give
you this in private at ten o'clock this evening, sir, thank
you, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you, David," said I, and went along to the
smoking-room, opening the letter as I went.</p>

<p>Although I felt that I ought to be filled with
apprehension, anxiety, and trouble, my heart sang for
glee, and I could have danced down the long corridor, to
the surprise and disapproval of the various stiff and
stately Brandons, male and female, who looked down from its
walls.</p>

<p>"This is most selfish and wrong," said I, and repressed
a desire to sing, whistle, and whoop, and literally jump
for joy.</p>

<p>"Isobel! Isobel! Isobel!" sang my heart. "Isobel loves
me and I love Isobel...."</p>

<p>The smoking-room was empty, and I could hear the click
of balls from the neighbouring billiard-room, showing why.
Gussie was evidently at his favourite, somewhat aimless,
evening employment.</p>

<p>I turned up the lights, poked up the fire, pulled up
the biggest and deepest chair, and filled my pipe and lit
it.</p>

<p>Had I come straight here from the dining-room, and here
received Digby's letter, I should have snatched it, and
opened it with sinking heart and trembling fingers.</p>

<p>Now, nothing seemed of much importance, compared with
the great fact of which my heart was chanting its pæan of
praise and thanks to God.</p>

<p>Love is very selfish I fear&mdash;but then it <i>is</i> the
very selves of two people becoming one self....</p>

<p>And then I read poor Digby's letter. It was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear John,</span></p>

<p class="letter">
I now take up my pen to write you these few lines,
hoping they find you as they won't find me. After
terrific thought and mental wrestling, which cost me a
trouser-button, I have come to the conclusion that I can no
longer deceive you all and let the innocent suffer for my
guilty sin or sinny guilt.</p>

<p class="letter">
I go to find my noble-hearted twin, to kneel at his
feet and say, "Brother, I have sinned in thy sight" (but it
was in the dark really) "and am no more worthy to be called
anything but what I am."</p>

<p class="letter">
No one knows the shame I feel, not even me; and, by the
time you get this, I shall be well on my way to&mdash;where
I am going.</p>

<p class="letter">
Will you please tell Aunt that Michael's noble and
beautiful action has wrung my heart, and I wish he had
wrung my neck. I cannot let him take the blame for me, like
this. I shall write to her from Town.</p>

<p class="letter">
When you find yourself in the witness-dock or
prisoner's-box tell the Beak that you have always known
me to be weak but not vicious, and that my downfall has
been due to smoking cigarettes and going in for newspaper
competitions. Also that you are sure that, if given time, I
shall redeem myself by hard work, earn thirty shillings a
week at least, and return the thirty thousand pounds out of
my savings.</p>

<p class="letter">
Write and let me know how things go on, as soon as I
send you an address&mdash;which you will, of course, keep
to yourself. Give my love to Isobel.</p>

<p class="letter">
Play up and don't forget you've <u>got</u> to stand by me
and make people realise the truth that I actually am the
thief&mdash;or suspicion still rests on Claudia (since
Isobel and Gussie are out of it), if we three do not
provide the criminal amongst us. And, of course, I can't
let Beau suffer for me.</p>

<p class="letter">
Directly you hear from him, let him know by wire that
I have confessed and bolted, and that he can return to
Brandon Abbas and admit that he was shielding the real
culprit (whom he knew to be ME or YOU or CLAUDIA!).</p>

<p class="letter">Give my love to Isabel.</p>

<p class="letter">Ever thine,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Digby</span>.</p>
<br>

<p>For a moment this drove even Isobel from my mind.</p>

<p>It had never occurred to me for one moment that Digby
had actually fled, as Michael had done. Could it be
possible that he was speaking the truth in the letter?</p>

<p>Could he have stolen the "Blue Water" as he said,
and had Michael's flight and shouldering of the blame
forced his hand and compelled him, in very shame, to
confess?...</p>

<p>Or did he, in his heart of hearts, think that Michael
was really guilty and had fled rather than allow three
innocent people to lie under suspicion with himself?
Had Digby, thinking this, fled to divert suspicion from
the guilty Michael, to confuse the issue and divide the
pursuit, thus giving him a better chance to get clear
away!...</p>

<p>Probably neither. It was much more likely that his idea
was to help to shield the person whom Michael thought he
was shielding, and at the same time to share with Michael
the suspicion thus diverted from the guilty person.</p>

<p>The moment it was known that Michael had fled, the world
and his wife would say, "The vile young thief!"</p>

<p>Directly Digby followed him they would say, "Which
of them <i>is</i> the thief?" and no eye would be turned
enquiringly upon those who, in their conscious innocence,
had remained at home.</p>

<p>And whom <i>did</i> Michael and Digby suspect, if they were
both innocent?</p>

<p>Obviously either Claudia or me.</p>

<p>And if they could no more suspect me than I could
suspect them...?</p>

<p>It dawned on me, or rather it was stabbed into my heart
suddenly, as with a knife, that it was quite as much <i>my</i>
affair to help in preventing suspicion, just or unjust,
from falling upon Claudia; and that if they could face
obloquy, poverty, hardship, and general wrecking of their
lives for Claudia and for me and for each other&mdash;why,
so could I for them, and that it was my duty to go too.</p>

<p>Moreover, when detectives and criminal-experts got to
work on the case, they would be quite capable of saying
that there was nothing to prevent Isobel and Augustus from
being in collusion to prove each other innocent, and would
suspect one or both of them the more.</p>

<p>To us, who knew her, it was completely proven that
Augustus was innocent, because she said so.</p>

<p>To a detective, it would more probably be a clue to
the guilty person&mdash; the girl who produced this piece
of "evidence" which incidentally proclaimed her own
innocence.</p>

<p>Moreover, the wretched Augustus had most undoubtedly
been <i>surprised</i> when Isobel said he must be innocent as
she had been holding on to him all the time the light
was out. If this came out, it would certainly fix the
suspicion on Isobel, and if it did not, there was a strong
probability that her declaration concerning Augustus would,
as I have said, suggest collusion between them.</p>

<p>The more reason then for me to strengthen the obvious
solution&mdash;that the thief was one of the Gestes.</p>

<p>If three people fled confessing their guilt, that was
where the collusion would be&mdash;among the three rascally
brothers who had plotted to rob their relative and share
the spoil.</p>

<p>That the oldest had weakened and fled first, was to
his credit, or not, according to whether you more admired
courage or confession; but obviously and incontestably, the
blame must lie upon these three, and not among those who
remained at home and faced the music.</p>

<p>"<i>But,</i>" said the voices of prudence, cowardice, and
common sense, as well as the voice of love, "<i>two are
enough to take the blame, surely? Let people say it was one
of those two, or perhaps the two in partnership.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>And why,</i>" replied the voices of self-respect and
pride, "<i>should those two share the blame (or the honour)?
Why should</i> <i>they shield Isobel and</i> YOU, <i>as well as
Claudia, from suspicion?</i>" and to the latter voice I
listened.</p>

<p>I could not possibly sit at home and enjoy life while
the Captain and the Lieutenant were in trouble, disgrace,
and danger&mdash;my whole life-training, as well as
instincts, forbade.</p>

<p>I think that within two minutes of reading Digby's
letter, the question of my going was quite definitely
answered, and only the minor questions of where I
should go, and whether I should say anything to Isobel,
remained to be settled. And one of these two problems was
subconsciously solved, though I had not intentionally
considered it and come to a decision.</p>

<p>From the moment that I had learnt of Michael's flight, I
had had somewhere, just below the level of consciousness, a
vague remembrance of the existence of a romantic-sounding,
adventurous corps of soldiers of fortune, called the French
Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>When thinking of Michael, and seeing mental pictures of
him in the setting of Brandon Abbas, our "Prep." school,
Eton and Oxford, one of the clearest of these dissolving
views had been of a group of us in the Bower, at the feet
of a smart and debonair young French officer, who had
thrilled us with dramatic tales of Algeria, Morocco, and
the Sahara; tales of Spahis, Turcos, Zouaves, Chasseurs
d'Afrique, and the French Foreign Legion of Mercenaries;
tales of hot life and brave death, of battle and of
bivouac. At the end, Michael had said:</p>

<p>"I shall join the French Foreign Legion when I leave
Eton.... Get a commission and go into his regiment," and
Digby and I had applauded the plan.</p>

<p>Had Michael remembered this, and was he, even now, on
his way to this life of adventure and glory, determined to
win his way to soldierly renown under a <i>nom de guerre?...</i>
It would be so like Michael.</p>

<p>And Digby? Had he had the same idea and followed him? It
would be so like Digby.</p>

<p>And I? Should I follow my brothers' lead, asking nothing
better than to do as they did, and win their approval!...
It would be so like me.</p>

<p>Three romantic young asses! I can smile at them now.
<i>Asses</i> without doubt; wild asses of the wildest; but
still, with the imagination and the soul to be romantic
asses, thank God!</p>

<h3>§ 10</h3>

<p class="first">As compensation for a smaller share of
the gifts of courage, cleverness, and general distinction
possessed by my brilliant brothers, I have been vouchsafed
a larger measure of prudence and caution&mdash;though some
may think that still does not amount to much.</p>

<p>I have met few men to equal Michael and Digby in
beauty, physical strength, courage, and intelligence; but
I was, in spite of being an equally incurable romantic,
"longer-headed" than they, and even more muscular and
powerful. This is tremendous praise to award myself, but
facts are facts.</p>

<p>Having decided to join them in disgrace and blame, as
well as to join them in the flesh if I could&mdash;going
to the Legion to look for them in the first place&mdash;I
settled down to consider details, ways, and means.</p>

<p>I can think better in the dark, so I knocked out my
pipe, burnt Digby's letter, and went up to bed.</p>

<p>The first fact to face, and it loomed largest and most
discouraging of all, was separation from Isobel in the very
moment of finding her. Paradoxically, however, the very
exaltation and excitement of this wonderful thing that had
happened, this finding of her, carried me along and gave me
the power to leave her.</p>

<p>I was <i>tête-montée,</i> beside myself, and above myself,
abnormal.</p>

<p>I would show my love that I, too, could do a fine thing,
and could make a personal sacrifice to ward off from women,
one of whom was mine, "the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune," outrageous suspicion and annoyance.</p>

<p>To leave her would be misery unspeakable&mdash;but what
a beautiful misery and poignantly delightful sorrow for the
heart of romantic youth to hug to itself!</p>

<p>Also I knew that it was quite useless for such children
as ourselves&mdash;she nineteen and I twenty&mdash;at
present penniless and dependent, to think of formal
engagements and early marriages. Love was all and love
was enough, until I should return, bronzed and decorated,
successful and established, a distinguished Soldier of
Fortune, to claim her hand.</p>

<p>I would then take my bride to be the admired and beloved
Pride of the Regiment, a soldier's star and stay and
queen.... (Twenty is a great age at which to be&mdash;with
love in your heart and life before you....)</p>

<p>Should I tell her what I was going to do and have one
last beautifully-terrible hour, with her in my arms, or
should I write her a letter to be given to her after I had
gone?</p>

<p>I am glad to say that I had the grace to look at it
from her point of view, and to decide according to what I
thought would be better for her.</p>

<p>In the letter I could give the impression that this was
only a short separation, and that I was writing to say "<i>Au
revoir</i>" rather than "Good-bye."</p>

<p>If I told her in an interview, my obvious wretchedness
and woebegone countenance would contradict my words. I
knew I should kiss and embrace her as if for the last time
on earth, and look as though I were going to the scaffold
rather than into hiding for a while, until the missing
jewel turned up, or the thief was caught.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;I had better write, being careful to avoid the
suggestion that this was any more a "separation" than my
going back to Oxford for the next term would have been.</p>

<p>That question was settled.</p>

<p>The next thing to consider was the problem of
procedure.</p>

<p>I should want sufficient money and kit to enable me
to get to France and subsist for a few days, probably in
Paris.</p>

<p>Ten pounds or so, a change of underclothing, and a
toothbrush, would be the sort of thing. With a very small
suit-case one would be quite comfortable.</p>

<p>My watch, links, studs, cigarette-case, and a good gold
pencil which I possessed would provide ample funds. I had
more than sufficient ready money for my fare to London, and
could there raise enough to carry me on to Paris and keep
me for a few days.</p>

<p>I would breakfast with the others, and quietly walk
off to catch the ten-forty to Exeter, and take the
eleven-forty-five thence to London, arriving about three
o'clock. I would cross to France the next day, getting
there in the evening; sleep at an hotel, and, as soon as
possible, become a soldier of France.</p>

<p>Whatever my brothers had done, I should at least have
followed their example worthily, and have given a realistic
and convincing imitation of the conduct of a frightened
and desperate thief, fleeing from the consequences of his
crime and the shame of facing his relatives and former
friends.</p>

<p>And if Michael and Digby were actually there when
I arrived&mdash;why, I should regret nothing but the
separation from Isobel&mdash;a separation, albeit, during
which I would qualify, in age, position, and income, for
the honour of becoming her husband.</p>

<p>I think I had arrived at the position of
Commander-in-Chief in Algeria and Grand Commander of the
Legion of Honour when I fell asleep....</p>

<p>I awoke in the morning in a very different frame of mind
from that of the morning before. My heart was full of pride
that Isobel loved me and was mine. My brain was full of
schemes and plans, and my whole being tingled gloriously
with a sense of high adventure.</p>

<p>"If youth but knew..."</p>

<p>When David brought my hot water, with his inevitable,
"Half-past seven, sir, and a fine morning" (when the rain
stops, or the fog clears, as the case might be), I told him
I should give him a letter, after breakfast, which he was
to give privately to Miss Rivers at the first convenient
opportunity after eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>I thought it better to give it to David than to a maid.
He had obeyed instructions in the case of Michael's letter
to Digby, and Digby's letter to me, and a maid would be
more likely to chatter in the servants' hall.</p>

<p>I did not think that there was the slightest suspicion
in that quarter, and, as Aunt Patricia had said, there was
no reason why there should be any, provided the mystery
of the "Blue Water" was solved without the aid of the
police.</p>

<p>I could have posted my letter to her of course, but that
would have involved delay, and an anxious night for her.
It would also mean a post-mark, and I thought it would be
better for her to be able to say, with perfect truth, that
she had not the vaguest idea as to where I had gone.</p>

<p>When I had dressed, I put my brushes and shaving-tackle
into an attaché-case, and crammed in a shirt, collars, and
socks, and then went down to the smoking-room, and, after
some unsatisfactory efforts, wrote to Isobel:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
My darling beautiful Sweetheart,</p>

<p class="letter">
I had a letter from Digby last night. He has bolted
because he thinks that Michael has shouldered the blame and
disgrace of this theft in order to protect the innocent
and shield the guilty person (who must appear to him to be
Claudia, Digby, or myself, as it is not you nor Gussie).
Digby told me that it was not he, and he refuses to
believe that it is Michael. I don't think he suspects me
either.</p>

<p class="letter">
Now, you'll be the first to agree that I can't sit at
home and let them do this, believing them to be innocent.
And if either of them were guilty, I'd want, all the more,
to do anything I could to help. Were it not for leaving
you, for a little while, just when I have found you, I
should be rather enjoying it, I am afraid.</p>

<p class="letter">
Anyhow, I should have had to leave you in a little
while, when I went up to Oxford again, and that would have
been an eight weeks' separation. As it is, we are only
going to be parted until this silly wretched business
is cleared up. I expect the thief will return the thing
anonymously as soon as he or she finds that we three are
all pretending we did it, and that we will not resume our
ordinary lives until restitution is made.</p>

<p class="letter">
You know that I didn't do it, and I know that you
didn't, and that's all that really matters; but you
wouldn't have me hold back when the Captain and Lieutenant
of the Band are out to divert suspicion from the innocent
and to shame the guilty into returning Aunt's property!</p>

<p class="letter">
I'll send you an address later on, so that you can tell
me what happens&mdash;but, just at first, I want you to
have no idea where I am, and to say so.</p>

<p class="letter">
You'd despise me, really, in your heart, if I stayed
at home, though I know you'll miss me and want me back.
I shall come, of course, the moment you let me know that
the affair is cleared up. Meanwhile, no ass of a detective
will be suspecting you or Claudia, or poor innocent Gussie,
since obviously one of the absconding three (or all of
them) must be the thief. Aunt will go to the police about
it of course, and they will soon be on our track, and
trouble no one at Brandon Abbas.</p>

<p class="letter">
And now, darling Isobel, darling Faithful Hound, I am
not going to try to tell you how much I love you&mdash;I
am going to do it before you get this. But everything
is different since last night. The world is a perfectly
glorious place, and life is a perfectly glorious thing.
Nothing matters, because Isobel loves me and I love
Isobel&mdash;for ever and ever. I want to sing all the
time, and to tell everybody.</p>

<p class="letter">Isn't love absolutely <span class="smcap">WONDERFUL</span>!</p>

<p class="letter">Always and always,</p>

<p class="letter">Your devoted, adoring, grateful</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sweetheart</span>.</p>
<br>

<p>This honest, if boyish, effusion I gave to David, and
repeated my instructions.</p>

<p>He contrived to keep his face correctly expressionless,
though he must have wondered how many more of us were going
to give him epistles to be privately delivered after their
departure to other members of the household.</p>

<p>Leaving the smoking-room, I met Burdon in the
corridor.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where Mr. Michael is, sir?" he asked.
"Her ladyship wishes to see him."</p>

<p>"No, I can't, Burdon," I replied, "for the excellent
reason that I don't know."</p>

<p>"Mr. Digby's bed have not been slep' in either, sir," he
went on. "I did not know the gentlemen were going away....
Nothing packed nor nothing."</p>

<p>"They didn't tell me they were going, Burdon," I said,
putting on an owlish look of wonder and speculation.
"They're off on some jaunt or other, I suppose.... I hope
they ask me to join them."</p>

<p>"Racing, p'r'aps, sir?" suggested Burdon sadly.</p>

<p>"Shocking," said I, and left him, looking waggish to the
best of my ability....</p>

<p>There were only the four of us at breakfast again.</p>

<p>Isobel's face lit up radiantly as our glances met, and
we telegraphed our love to each other.</p>

<p>"Anyone heard how the Chaplain is?" asked Claudia.</p>

<p>"I went to see him last night," replied Isobel, "but the
nurse said he was asleep."</p>

<p>"Nurse?" asked Augustus.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Isobel. "Dr. Warrender thought he ought to
have a night-nurse, and Aunt Patricia telegraphed for one.
He's going to get up to-day though, the nurse told me."</p>

<p>"Where's Digby?" asked Augustus.</p>

<p>"Why?" I said elliptically.</p>

<p>"Burdon asked me if I'd seen him, and said he wasn't in
last night."</p>

<p>"I know no more than you do where he is," I honestly
assured him.</p>

<p>"Funny&mdash;isn't it?" he sneered.</p>

<p>"Most humorous," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Aunt will think so," countered Augustus
unpleasantly.... "First Michael and then Digby, after what
she said about not leaving the house!"</p>

<p>"Ought to have consulted you first, Gussie," said
Claudia.</p>

<p>"Looks as though they didn't want to consult the police,
if you ask me," he snarled.</p>

<p>"We didn't ask you, Gussie," said Isobel, and so the
miserable meal dragged through.</p>

<p>Towards the end of it, Burdon came in.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship wishes to see Mr. Digby," he said to the
circumambient air.</p>

<p>"Want a bit of doing, I should say," remarked Augustus,
with a snigger.</p>

<p>"He's not here, Burdon," said I, looking under the
table.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Burdon gravely, and departed.</p>

<p>"You next, my lad," Augustus stated, eyeing me severely.
"I wonder if the detectives have come."</p>

<p>Burdon returned.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship would like to see you in her boudoir,
after breakfast, sir," said he to me.</p>

<p>"Told you so," remarked Augustus, as the door closed
behind the butler.</p>

<p>"Where do you think the others have gone?" asked
Claudia, turning to me. "They can't have <i>run away</i> surely?
not both of them?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't look like it, does it?" put in Augustus.</p>

<p>"If they have gone away it's for an excellent reason,"
said Isobel.</p>

<p>"Best of reasons," agreed Augustus.</p>

<p>"Quite the best, Claudia," said I, looking at her. "<i>If</i>
they have 'run away,' as you said, it is to turn suspicion
away from the house and everybody in it, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," agreed Augustus again.</p>

<p>"Just what they would do," said Isobel quietly.</p>

<p>"It would be like Michael," said Claudia in a low voice,
and getting up, went quickly out of the room.</p>

<p>"And Digby," added I, as she did so.</p>

<p>Augustus departed soon after, with a malicious "Up you
go" to me, and a jerk of his thumb in the direction of
Aunt Patricia's room. Our recent roughness and suspicion
evidently rankled in his gentle breast.</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone, I turned to Isobel, who sat
beside me, put my arms round her and gave and received a
long kiss.</p>

<p>"Come out to the Bower a minute, darling," said I, and
we scuttled off together.</p>

<p>There I crushed her to my breast and kissed her lips,
her cheeks, and eyes, and hair, as though I could never
have enough, and never stop.</p>

<p>"Will you love me for ever, darling?" I asked. "Whatever
may happen to us, or wherever we may be?"</p>

<p>She did not reply in words, but her answer was very
satisfying.</p>

<p>"Aunt wants me," then said I, and bolted back to the
house. But I had no intention of seeing Aunt Patricia.</p>

<p>Mine should be the more convincing rôle of the uneasy,
trembling criminal, who, suddenly sent for, finds he has
not the courage to face the ordeal, and flees before the
ominous sound of the summons.</p>

<p>I was very glad this had happened, as it would appear to
have given me the cue for flight.</p>

<p>When first sent for, I was found peacefully eating my
breakfast in fancied security. When again sent for, I
should be missing&mdash;obviously terrified of the command
and guiltily afraid to obey it.</p>

<p>Going to my room, I took my attaché-case from the
wardrobe, pocketed a photograph of Isobel, and went
quietly down the service staircase that debouched by the
luggage-lift in a passage opening into the outer hall. In a
minute I was across the shrubbery and into the drive at a
bend which hid it from the house.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes' walking brought me to the station, where
I booked to Exeter. That would not tell anybody very much,
for though I was perfectly well known to everybody at our
local station, it would be extremely unlikely that I should
be traced from so busy a junction as Exeter, in the crowd
that would be booking for the morning train to Waterloo.</p>

<p>As I waited on our platform, I was conscious of an
almost unbearable longing to go back to Brandon Abbas and
Isobel. How <i>could</i> I leave her like this, now, the very
day after I had found her?</p>

<p>I felt a bigger lump in my throat than I had ever known
since I was a child. It was utterly horrible.</p>

<p>But for the excitement and adventure of the business, I
think I should have succumbed to the longing to return. But
when two loving people part, one going on a journey, it is
always the departing one who suffers the less.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that the distractions of travel,
movement, change, shall drug the pain to which the other
is equally exposed without the amelioration of mental and
bodily occupation.</p>

<p>So, between my mind and the agony of separation
from Isobel came the deadening and protecting cloak
of action and of the competing thoughts of other
matters&mdash;journey's end, the future, money, Paris,
Algeria, the probabilities of finding Michael and
Digby....</p>

<p>Anyhow, I conquered the yearning to go back to her, and
when the local train loafed in I got into it, with a stiff
upper lip and a bleeding heart, and set out on as eventful
and strange a journey as ever a man took.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch203" id="ch203">III. &mdash; THE GAY
ROMANTICS</a></h2>

<p class="poem">"Curs'd from the cradle and awry they
come<br> Masking their torment from a world at ease:<br> On
eyes of dark entreaty, vague and dumb,<br> They bear the
stigma of their souls' disease."</p><br>

<p class="first">I REMEMBER nothing of that horrible
journey from Exeter to Waterloo. It passed as a bad dream
passes, and I awoke from it in London.</p>

<p>As has happened to others in the history of that city, I
found that, in such circumstances, London was a very large
place, and myself a very small and lonely atom of human
dust therein.</p>

<p>Walking out from Waterloo Station into the unpleasing
purlieus thereof, I was tempted to go to the quiet and
exclusive hotel that the Brandons had patronised for very
many years, and where I was well known and should feel a
sense of being at home among friends.</p>

<p>For this very reason I resisted the temptation, and was
aided to do so by the question of finance. Whatever I did,
I must leave myself sufficient money for my journey to
Paris and subsistence there until I should become a soldier
of France, to be lodged, boarded, clothed, and paid by
Madame la République.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was to convert my disposable
property into cash, a distasteful undertaking, but
essential to further progress along the path I had elected
to follow. If I had to do nothing more unpleasant than
that, I told myself, as I walked along down a mean street
toward Westminster Bridge, the said path would be no thorny
one.</p>

<p>And, at that moment, my eye fell upon what I took to
be the very place I wanted&mdash;a pawnbroker's shop,
stuffed to bursting with a most heterogeneous collection
of second-hand merchandise, ranging from clothing
and jewellery by way of boxing-gloves, guns, knives,
meerschaum pipes and cigar-holders, cameras, umbrellas
and walking-sticks, field-glasses, portmanteaux, to
concertinas, cornets, and musical instruments of every
description.</p>

<p>I entered and found a young gentleman, of markedly
Hebraic appearance, behind the counter. I expected to hear
him say:</p>

<p>"Vat d'ye vant, Mithter?" and waggle his hands, palms
upwards, near his shoulders, as I remembered a song, last
heard at Oxford, anent one Solomon Levi and his store at
Chatham Street.</p>

<p>For some reason, best known to himself, he wore a
bowler hat of proportions so generous that it rested upon
the nape of his neck and his ears, depressing the latter
well-developed organs, so that they drooped forward as
droops the tired lily&mdash;though in no other way did they
suggest that flower.</p>

<p>To compensate for the indoor wearing of this outdoor
garment, he had discarded his coat, exposing shirt-sleeves
that again did not suggest the lily. A very large
watch-chain adorned a fancy waistcoat that was certainly
worn by him at meal-times also, and his diamond tie-pin
bore testimony to his financial solidity and to his
taste.</p>

<p>I fear I looked at him for a few seconds longer than
good manners could approve&mdash;but then he looked at
me for precisely the same length of time, though with a
difference. For I was looking with a wondering admiration,
whereas he was regarding me with little of wonder and less
of admiration.</p>

<p>It was perfectly clear that he did not regard me as a
buyer, though by what instinct or experience he could tell,
I know not.</p>

<p>"Surely," thought I, "even if I have not the appearance
of one who comes to buy, I still do not look like a needy,
seedy seller?"</p>

<p>But he knew! He knew; and his silence was eloquent.</p>

<p>As his bold brown eyes regarded me, his curved nostril
curved a little more, and his large ripe lips, beneath the
pendulous nose, ripened while I watched.</p>

<p>He said no word, and this fact somewhat disconcerted me,
for I had hitherto regarded the Children of Israel as a
decidedly chatty race.</p>

<p>I broke the heavy silence of the dark mysterious shop,
and added strange sounds to the strange sights and stranger
smells.</p>

<p>"I want to sell my watch and one or two things," said I
to this silent son of Abraham's seed.</p>

<p>He did not triumph in the manifest rightness of his
judgment that I was a contemptible seller and not an
admirable buyer. He did not do anything at all, in fact. He
did not even speak.</p>

<p>No word nor sigh nor sound escaped him.</p>

<p>I produced my watch and laid it at his feet, or rather
at his stomach. It was gold and good, and it had cost
twenty-five pounds. (I allude to the watch.)</p>

<p>"'Ow much?" said the child of the Children of Israel.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;well&mdash;isn't that rather for you to say?"
I replied. "I know it cost twenty-five pounds and is an
excellent..."</p>

<p>"'Ow much?" interrupted the swarthy Child.</p>

<p>"How much will you give me?" I replied...." Suppose we
split the difference and you..."</p>

<p>"'Ow much?" interrupted the Child again.</p>

<p>"Ten pounds?" I suggested, feeling that I was being
reasonable and, indeed, generous. I did not wish my
necessitous condition to weigh with him and lead him to
decrease his just profits.</p>

<p>"Two quid," said the Child promptly.</p>

<p>"Not a tenth of what it cost?" said I, on a note of
remonstrance. "Surely that is hardly a fair and..."</p>

<p>"Two quid," interrupted the Child, whose manners seemed
less rich than his attire.</p>

<p>I was tempted to take up the watch and depart, but
I felt I could not go through all this again. Perhaps
two pounds was the recognised selling price of all gold
watches?</p>

<p>Producing my cigarette-case, gold pencil, and a tiny
jeweller's box containing my dress studs, I laid them
before this spoiler of Egyptians, and then detached my
links from my shirt-cuffs.</p>

<p>"'Ow much?" enquired the Child once more.</p>

<p>"Well," replied I, "the pencil is pretty heavy, and the
studs are good. So are the links. They're all eighteen
carat and the..."</p>

<p>"'Ow much?" repeated the voice, which I was beginning to
dislike.</p>

<p>"Ten pounds for the watch, pencil, and..."</p>

<p>"Four quid," the Child replied, in the voice of Fate and
Destiny and Doom, and seeking a toothpick in the pocket
of his "gent's fancy vest," he guided it about its lawful
occasions.</p>

<p>This would not do. I felt I must add at least five
pounds to what I already had. I was a little vague as to
the absolutely necessary minimum, but another five pounds
seemed to me to be very desirable.</p>

<p>"Oh, come&mdash;make it seven," said I, in the bright
tone of encouragement and optimism.</p>

<p>The Child regarded the point of his toothpick. It
appeared to interest him far more than I, or my poor
affairs, could ever do.</p>

<p>"Six," said I, with falsely cheerful hopefulness.</p>

<p>The toothpick returned to duty, and a brooding silence
fell upon us.</p>

<p>"Five, then," I suggested, with a falsely firm
finality.</p>

<p>The Child yawned. For some reason I thought of onions,
beer, and garlic, things very well in their way and their
place, and quite pleasing to those who like them.</p>

<p>"Then I'm afraid I've wasted your valuable time," said
I, with deep wiliness, making as though to gather up my
despised property.</p>

<p>The Child did not trouble to deny my statement. He
removed his bowler hat and looked patiently into its
interior, as good men do in church. The hair of the head
of the Child was most copiously abundant, and wonderfully
curly. I thought of oil-presses, anointed bulls of Bashan,
and, with bewildered awe, of the strange preferences of
Providence.</p>

<p>However, I would walk to the door and see whether,
rather than let me go, he would offer five pounds for what
had cost at least fifty.</p>

<p>As I did so, this representative of the Chosen People
cocked an eye at my dispatch-case.</p>

<p>"Wotcher got there?" he growled.</p>

<p>Imitating his excellent economy of words, I opened the
case without reply, and removing a silk shirt, vest, and
socks, displayed three collars, a pair of silver-backed
hair-brushes, a comb, a silver-handled shaving-brush, a
razor, an ivory nailbrush, a tooth-brush, and a silver box
containing soap.</p>

<p>"Five quid the lot and chance if you've pinched 'em,"
said the Child.</p>

<p>"You'll give me five pounds for a gold watch, links,
studs, and pencil-case; a silver cigarette-case,
hair-brushes, and shaving-brush; a razor, shirt, vests,
socks, collars, and a leather dispatch-case?" I enquired
politely.</p>

<p>"Yus," said the Child succinctly.</p>

<p>Well, I could get shaved for a few pence, and in a
couple of days I should probably be in uniform.</p>

<p>"I'll keep the tooth-brush and a collar," I remarked,
putting them in my pocket.</p>

<p>"Then chuck in the walkin' stick and gloves, or it's
four-fifteen," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>I gazed upon the Child in pained astonishment.</p>

<p>"I gotter <i>live,</i> ain't I?" he replied, in a piteous
voice, to my cruel look.</p>

<p>Forbearing to observe "<i>Je ne vois pas la nécessité,</i>" I
laid my stick and gloves on the counter, realising that, in
any case, I should shortly have no further need of them.</p>

<p>The Child produced a purse, handed me five pounds, and
swept my late property into a big drawer.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I, departing. "Good evening."</p>

<p>But the Child apparently did not think it was a good
evening, for he vouchsafed no reply.</p>

<p>One should not judge a race by single specimens,
of course, but&mdash;racial antipathy is a curious
thing....</p>

<p>Crossing Westminster Bridge, with about ten pounds in my
pocket, misery in my heart, and nothing in my hand, I made
my way along Whitehall to Trafalgar Square, sorely tempted
by the sight and smell of food as I passed various places
devoted to the provision of meals, but not of beds.</p>

<p>It had occurred to me that it would be cheaper to dine,
sleep, and breakfast at the same place, than to have dinner
somewhere, and then go in search of a bedroom for the night
and breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p>As I walked, I thought of the hotels of which I
knew&mdash;the Ritz, the Savoy, the Carlton, Claridge's,
the Grosvenor, the Langham, and certain more discreet and
exclusive ones in the neighbourhood of the Albany (where
Uncle Hector kept a <i>pied-à-terre</i> for his use when in
England).</p>

<p>But both their cost and their risks were almost as much
against them as were those of our own family hotel. Even if
I could afford to go to such hotels as these, it was quite
likely that the first person I should run against, in the
one I selected, would be some friend or acquaintance.</p>

<p>I decided to approach one of those mines of information,
or towers of strength and refuge, a London policeman.</p>

<p>"Take a bus to Bloomsbury, and you'll find what you
want. Russell Square, Bedford Square, British Museum. All
round that neighbourhood," was the reply of the stalwart to
whom I applied for advice, as to a cheap, quiet, and decent
hotel.</p>

<p>I obeyed his words, and had an edible dinner, a clean
and comfortable bed, and a satisfying breakfast, for a
surprisingly small sum, in an hotel that looked on to
the British Museum and seemed to be the favoured of the
clergy&mdash;it being almost full of men of religion and
their women-folk of even more religion.</p>

<p>The "young lady" at the bureau of this chaste hostelry
did something to enhance the diminished self-respect that
my Israelite had left to me, by making no comment upon
the fact that I was devoid of luggage, and by refraining
from asking me to produce money in advance of hospitality.
Perhaps she had a more discerning eye, or perhaps merely
a softer heart, than had the child of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob; or perhaps she was merely more of a fool.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I was glad to get away in the morning and
to seek the shop of a hairdresser, after sleeping, for the
first time in my life, without pyjamas, and bathing without
a sponge. I was also glad to feel that the tips which I had
given, with apologies for their modesty, to the waiter and
chamber-maid had seemed quite adequate in their sight, and
to cover my known deficiencies both of evening wear and
night-gear.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary how naked I felt without my links,
and how dishevelled without having used a brush and
comb.</p>

<p>Finding a desirable barber's in Oxford Street, I was
shaven and shampooed and went on my way, if not rejoicing,
at any rate in better case, and feeling more my own man.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">My journey to Paris was uneventful and
uncomfortable, confirming me in my opinion that economy in
travelling is one of the dearest economies of all.</p>

<p>Personally, I would always rather travel first class and
miss my meals, than travel third and enjoy three good ones,
on a day's journey. Nor is this in the least due to paltry
exclusiveness and despicable snobbishness. It is merely
that I would rather spend the money on a comfortable seat,
a pleasant compartment, and freedom from crowding, than on
food with cramped circumstance. Let him who, in his wisdom,
would rather spend his money on good food and have the
discomfort, do so by all means.</p>

<p><i>De gustibus non disputandum,</i> as the learned say, and
likewise, <i>Chacun à son goût.</i></p>

<p>Anyhow, the third-class journey was by no means to my
<i>goût</i> at the time, though the day quickly came when it
would have seemed the height of luxury.</p>

<p>From Charing Cross (where I turned my pounds into francs
and felt much richer) to Dover I contrasted the beautiful
county of Kent with my own Devon, in favour of the latter;
and, at Dover, I went on board the cross-Channel steamer,
deeply and appreciatively inhaling the glorious air, after
that of the dusty, stuffy, crowded compartment in which I
had travelled down.</p>

<p>Mentally I was in a curious condition, for while one
half of myself ached unbearably for Isobel, the other
half rejoiced wildly at the thought of adventure, travel,
novelty, spacious life, mysterious Africa, the desert,
fighting, and all that appeals to the heart of romantic
youth.</p>

<p>At Calais, the sight of a French soldier, a sentry near
the Custom House, gave me a real thrill.</p>

<p>Was I actually going to wear that uniform myself in
a day or two? A <i>képi,</i> baggy red breeches, and a long
overcoat, buttoned back from the legs? How much more
attractive and romantic than the familiar British uniform
that seemed to suggest Hyde Park and nurse-maids, rather
than palms, oases, Moorish cities, and desert warfare.</p>

<p>So is the unknown always better than the known, and the
thing we have not, better than that we have....</p>

<p>At the Gare du Nord I experienced, in an intensified
form, that sense of loneliness and utter insignificance
that had assailed me at Waterloo; and I went out into the
bright uproar of gay Paris, feeling anything but bright,
uproarious, or gay myself. I was once more faced with the
problem of hotels, for I had not the least idea as to
how one set about offering one's services to France as a
mercenary soldier, and the first thing to do, therefore,
was to find a roof and a bed to serve me while I set about
the quest.</p>

<p>My knowledge of Paris hotels was confined to the
Meurice, Crillon, the Bristol, and the Ambassadors, but I
knew these to be expensive, and, moreover, places at which
I might meet acquaintances. There was no great likelihood
of my meeting anyone who knew me well; but there was a
chance, and I wanted to behave precisely as a guilty
fugitive would do.</p>

<p>If I were traced, and it were found that I had gone, in
London and Paris, to places where I might meet friends, it
would hardly look as though I were a genuine jewel-thief,
anxious to cover his tracks as he fled the country.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I did not want to blunder into an
obscure cheap hotel, without luggage, an obvious foreigner,
and run the risk of a visit from a polite but inquisitive
<i>agent de police,</i> as seemed to me quite possible, if I and
my explanations struck the proprietor as peculiar....</p>

<p>A whimsical idea struck me. Why not go to the police
themselves for advice on the subject of avoiding such
trouble!</p>

<p>Sauntering along the noisy busy thoroughfare that passes
the Gare du Nord, I looked out for a gendarme.</p>

<p>Presently I saw one standing on an island in the middle
of the road, silent, inscrutable, immobile, heavily caped,
oppressed by great responsibilities. Crossing to him, I
raised my hat, and in my best and politest French (which is
not bad, thanks to a French governess in our youth, and the
Chaplain's wisdom and care), asked him if he could direct
me to a good quiet hotel.</p>

<p>Moving his eyes, but not his head, nor any other portion
of his majestic person, he examined me from top to toe and
back again.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is English," he pronounced.</p>

<p>I acknowledged the truth of his statement, wondering
how he knew I was not German, Swiss, Danish, Swedish,
Norwegian, nor Dutch.</p>

<p>"Hôtel Normandie, Rue de l'Échelle," he announced
without hesitation.</p>

<p>"And how do I get there, <i>Monsieur l'Officier?</i>" I
asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Fiacre,</i>" was the prompt, terse reply, and the
all-seeing official eye left me and sought among the
traffic. A white-gloved hand was suddenly raised, and an
open cab, driven by a many-caped gentleman, who did not
look like a teetotaller, approached.</p>

<p>"Normandie, Rue de l'Échelle," said my gendarme to the
<i>cocher,</i> and gave me a military salute, as I thanked him,
raised my hat, and stepped into the carriage.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the drive through beautiful Paris in the
mingled glow of late sunset and the myriad lights of the
shops and streets; but my heart sank a little as the cab
drew up before a fashionable-looking hotel that stood at a
busy corner, close to the Rue de Rivoli and to the Rue de
la Paix.</p>

<p>It looked as expensive as the best. However, Fate had
sent me here, and here I would stay.</p>

<p>Trying to look as unconcerned as a luggageless traveller
may, I entered the hall, received the bow of an imposing
hall-porter, and marched straight ahead, past the grand
staircase and the dining-room, to where I could see the
bureau, and beyond it, the palm-decked <i>fumoir.</i></p>

<p>At the bureau, a very pretty girl was talking to an
American in American.</p>

<p>This was good luck. I could make a much more convincing
show in English than in my pedantic and careful French.</p>

<p>Standing near, and trying to look like an eccentric
foreigner who habitually went about without stick or gloves
in order that he might keep his hands in his pockets, I
waited for the American to go.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was quite impossible to avoid hearing
what was said by the keen-faced, square-shouldered,
lumpy-toed, baggy-trousered, large-hatted gentleman to the
lady, what time she chewed a cud of sweet recollection and
Mangle's Magnificent Masticating Gum or similar enduring
comestible.</p>

<p>When at length he took his key and went, I turned to the
girl.</p>

<p>"So you was raised in Baltimore!" said I rapturously.
"Fancy that being your home town now! Isn't it just
the cutest place? Peachiest gals and bulliest cakes in
America!... Say, I reckon this gay Paree hasn't got
anything on little old New York!"...</p>

<p>"My!" said the young lady. "D'you know Baltimore? You
don't say!" and she smiled sweetly upon me.</p>

<p>"<i>Know Baltimore!</i>" said I, and left it at that....
"Lots of Americans and English here, I suppose," I went on,
"since the hotel folk are wise (and lucky) enough to have
you in the bureau? And I suppose you speak French as well
as any Parisian?"</p>

<p>"My, yes," she smiled. "Most as well as I speak good
old U.S.... Why, yes--lots of home people and Britishers
here.... Most of our waiters can help 'em out too, when
they're stuck for the French of '<i>Yes, I'll have a
highball, Bo,</i>'" and she tinkled a pretty little laugh.</p>

<p>"Guess that's fine," said I. "I want to turn in here for
a day or two. All upset at my place." (Very true, indeed.)
"Just to sleep and breakfast. Got a vacant location?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said my fair friend, and glanced at
an indicator. "<i>Troisième.</i> Eighteen francs.
No&mdash;breakfast only&mdash;fourteen. Going up now?" And
she unhooked a key and passed it to me with a brief "<i>Deux
cent vingt deux.</i> The bell-hop will show you."</p>

<p>"Not bringing any stuff in," I said, and drew my entire
fortune from my pocket, as one who would pay whatever was
desired in advance, and the more the merrier.</p>

<p>"Shucks," said my friendly damsel, and I gathered that I
was deemed trustworthy.</p>

<p>In the big book that she pushed to me I wrote myself
down as Smith, but clung to the "John," that there might be
something remnant and stable in a whirling and dissolving
universe.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll hike up and take possession now," said I
thereafter, and with my best smile and bow I turned to the
lift before she could send to the hall-porter to dispatch
a supposititious suit-case to the spot.</p>

<p>The lift-boy piloted me to number two hundred and
twenty-two, where, safe inside, I bolted the door and drew
breath.</p>

<p>"<i>J'y suis, j'y reste,</i>" said I, in tribute to my very
French surroundings..." and the less they see of me below,
the less they'll notice my lack of luggage and evening
kit."</p>

<p>It occurred to me that it might be worth the money
to buy a pair of pyjamas and have them sent to Monsieur
Smith, No. 222 Hôtel Normandie. If I laid them out on the
flat square pillow that crowned the lace-covered bed, the
chamber-maid would not be so likely to comment on the
paucity of my possessions, particularly if I locked the
wardrobe and pocketed the key as though to safeguard a
valuable dressing-case.</p>

<p>If I also avoided the dining-room, where, in my
lounge-suit, I should be extremely conspicuous among the
fashionable evening throng, I might well hope to dwell in
peaceful obscurity without rousing unwelcome interest and
attention, in spite of the inadequacy of my equipment.</p>

<p>I decided to sally forth, buy some pyjamas,
order them to be sent in at once, and then fortify
myself with a two-franc dinner and a glass of <i>vin
ordinaire</i>&mdash;probably <i>très ordinaire</i>&mdash;in some
restaurant.</p>

<p>After an uncomfortable wash in the <i>lavabo,</i> I strolled
nonchalantly forth, made my purchases, and enjoyed a good
and satisfying meal in a cheerful place situated in a
somewhat ignobler part of the Rue de Rivoli, at a little
distance from the fashionable centre of Paris.</p>

<p>Returning to my over-furnished unhomely room, I spread
out the gay pyjamas which awaited me, and wondered when the
chamber-maid would come to turn down the bed. And then I
realised that I need have felt no anxiety, for I had only
to bolt the door and shout something when she came, and she
would depart in ignorance of my complete lack of luggage
and possessions.</p>

<p>However, I should not be able to keep her out in the
morning, when I went in search of breakfast and the
recruiting-office, and then the pyjamas and the locked
wardrobe would play their part.</p>

<p>Even as I stood revolving these important trifles
in my youthful breast, the door opened and in burst a
hard-featured middle-aged woman. Anything less like the
French chamber-maid of fiction and the drama could not
well be imagined; for she was fair-haired, grey-eyed,
unprepossessing, and arrayed in a shapeless black frock,
plain apron, and ugly cap.</p>

<p>With a curt apology she flicked down a corner of the
bedclothes, slapped the pyjamas down (in what is presumably
the only place whence a self-respecting hotel guest can
take them up), glanced at the unused washstand, and
scurried from the room.</p>

<p>As I heard her unlock the door of the next apartment,
almost before she had closed mine, I realised that she was
far too busy to concern herself with my deficiencies, and
ceased to worry myself on the subject.</p>

<p>Feeling that sleep was yet far from me, and that if
I sat long in that unfriendly room I should go mad, I
descended to the <i>fumoir,</i> sought a big chair in a retired
nook, and, from behind a deplorable copy of <i>La Vie
Parisienne,</i> watched the frequenters of this apparently
popular lounge.</p>

<p>Here I thought long thoughts of Isobel, my brothers, and
Brandon Abbas; and occasionally wondered what would happen
on the morrow.</p>

<p>Nothing at all would happen until I had discovered
the procedure for enlisting in the Foreign Legion, and
the discovery of that procedure must be to-morrow's
business.</p>

<p>Were I a romancer as well as a romantic, now would be
the moment for me to announce the dramatic entry of the
French officer who had fired our young imaginations, years
before, and sown the seeds now bearing fruit.</p>

<p>As I sat there in the lounge of the Paris hotel, he
would enter and call for coffee and cognac. I should go up
to him and say, "<i>Monsieur le Capitaine</i> does not remember
me, perhaps?" He would rise, take my hand, and say, "<i>Mon
Dieu!</i> The young Englishman of Brandon Abbas!" I should
tell him of my ambition to be a soldier of France, to
tread in his footsteps, to rise to rank and fame in the
service of his great country, and he would say, "Come with
me&mdash;and all will be well...."</p>

<p>Unfortunately he did not enter, and presently, finding
myself the last occupant of the lounge and inclined to
yawn, I crept unwillingly to bed. I fell asleep, trying to
remember his name.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">The next day was Sunday, and I spent it
miserably between the lounge and my bedroom.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, after a spongeless bath and an
unsatisfying <i>petit déjeuner,</i> I sallied forth and put
myself in the hands of an excellent barber, and, while
enjoying his deft ministrations, had a bright idea. I would
pump this chatty person.</p>

<p>"You don't know Algeria, I suppose?" I asked the man.</p>

<p>"But no, Monsieur," he replied. "Is Monsieur going
there?"</p>

<p>"I hope to," I said. "A magnificent colony of your great
country, that."</p>

<p>Ah, it was, indeed. Monsieur might well say so. A
wonderful achievement and the world's model colony. Growing
too, always growing.... This excellent <i>pénétration
pacifique</i> to the South and towards Morocco....</p>

<p>"They do the pacific penetration by means of the
bayonets of the Foreign Legion mostly, don't they?" I
asked.</p>

<p>The Frenchman smiled and shrugged.</p>

<p>"A set of German rascals," he said. "But they have their
uses...."</p>

<p>"How do you get them?" I asked.</p>

<p>Oh, they just enlisted. Made their <i>engagements
volontaires,</i> like anybody else, at the head
recruiting-office of the French army in the Rue St.
Dominique. Simply enlisted there and were packed off to
Africa....</p>

<p>"But I thought service was wholly compulsory in this
country?" said I. "How then do you have recruiting-offices
for a conscript army?"</p>

<p>The worthy soul explained at length, and so far as I
could follow his swift idiomatic talk, that any Frenchman
could, if he liked, volunteer for service before the
time came when he <i>must</i> serve, whether he liked it
or not. Sometimes, for business reasons, it was very
convenient to get it over and done with, instead of having
it to do later, when one was established. Hence the
recruiting-office for the French army. But no Frenchman
could volunteer for the Legion until he had done his
compulsory service....</p>

<p>I let him talk on, keeping the words <i>Rue St. Dominique</i>
clearly in my mind the while. I had got what I wanted, and
the sooner I found this recruiting-office the better, for
funds would soon be running low.</p>

<p>On leaving the shop I hailed a <i>fiacre,</i> said, "Rue St.
Dominique," and jumped in, excusing my extravagance by my
absolute ignorance of the route, and the need for haste.</p>

<p>Again I enjoyed the drive, feeling excited and buoyant,
and filled with the sense of adventure. After a time, I
found we were in what appeared to be the military quarter
of Paris, and I saw the <i>École Militaire</i> and some
cavalry-barracks. The streets were thronged with men in
uniform, and my heart beat higher and higher as the cab
turned from the Esplanade des Invalides into the Rue St.
Dominique.</p>

<p>As the <i>cocher</i> looked round enquiringly at me, I
thought it would be as well to pay him off here at the
corner.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might not be good form to drive up, in style,
to a recruiting-office, and, in any case, there was no
need to let the man know where I was going....</p>

<p>I found the Rue St. Dominique to be a wholly uninspiring
thoroughfare, narrow, gloomy, and dingy in the extreme.</p>

<p>Walking along it and glancing from side to side, I soon
found the building of which I was in search.</p>

<p>Over the door of a dirty little house was a
blue-lettered notice testifying that the place was the
BUREAU DE RECRUTEMENT. Below the label was the bald,
laconic observation, ENGAGEMENTS VOLONTAIRES.</p>

<p>Well, here then was my bureau of recruitment and here
would I make my "voluntary engagement," and if the Path
of Glory led but to the grave, its beginning was quite in
keeping with its end, for a more sepulchral-looking abode
of gloom than this ugly little government-office I have
never seen.</p>

<p>Crossing the road, I pushed open a rusty iron gate,
undeterred by its agonised or warning shriek, crossed the
neglected cemetery garden of this gay place, thrust back a
swing door, and entered a long dark passage.</p>

<p>I could see no notice recommending all to abandon hope
who entered here, but my drooping spirits were unraised by
a strangling odour of carbolic, coal-gas, and damp.</p>

<p>On the wall was a big placard which, in the sacred names
of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, offered to accept for
five years the services of any applicant for admission to
<i>La Légion Étrangère</i> (provided he was between the ages of
eighteen and forty), and to give him a wage of a halfpenny
a day.</p>

<p>There seemed to me to be little of Liberty about this
proposal, less of Equality, and least of Fraternity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it was an <i>engagement volontaire,</i>
and anyone who didn't like the offer could leave it.
No one was compelled to accept it, and there was no
deception&mdash;on the placard at any rate.</p>

<p>I read the notice through again, half hoping that while
I did so, someone would come and ask my business, some
sound break the heavy smelly silence of Glory's cradle.</p>

<p>But none did, and "with well-feigned hopefulness I
pushed forth into the gloom."</p>

<p>Venturing on, I came to a kind of booking-office
ticket-window, above which were repeated the words
<i>Engagements Volontaires.</i></p>

<p>I looked in, and in a severe office or orderly-room,
beheld an austere person in uniform, seated at a table
and writing busily. The two gold stripes above his cuff
inclined me to suppose that he was a non-commissioned
officer, though of what rank and eminence I knew not.</p>

<p>He ignored me and all other insects.</p>

<p>How to attract his attention?</p>

<p>I coughed gently and apologetically. I coughed
appealingly. I coughed upbraidingly, sorrowfully,
suggestively, authoritatively, meekly, imperiously,
agreeably, hopefully, hopelessly, despairingly, and quite
vainly. Evidently I should not cough my way to glory.</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur le Capitaine,</i>" I murmured ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>The man looked up. I liked him better when looking
down.</p>

<p>"Monsieur would appear to have a throat-trouble," he
observed.</p>

<p>"And Monsieur an ear-trouble," I replied, in my young
ignorance and folly.</p>

<p>"What is Monsieur's business?" he enquired sharply.</p>

<p>"I wish to join the <i>Légion Étrangère,</i>" I said.</p>

<p>The man smiled, a little unpleasantly, I thought.</p>

<p>"<i>Eh, bien,</i>" he remarked, "doubtless Monsieur will have
much innocent amusement at the expense of the Sergeant
Major there too," and I was quite sure that his smile was
unpleasant this time.</p>

<p>"Is Monsieur only a Sergeant-Major then?" I enquired
innocently.</p>

<p>"I am a Sergeant-Major," was the reply, "and let me
tell Monsieur, it is the most important rank in the French
army."</p>

<p>"No?" said I, and lived to learn that this piece of
information was very little short of the simple truth.</p>

<p>"Wait by that door, please," requested the
Sergeant-Major, indicating one marked <i>Commandant de
Recrutement,</i> and I felt that he had also said, "Wait, just
wait, my friend, until you have enlisted."</p>

<p>I waited.</p>

<p>I should think I waited an hour.</p>

<p>Just as I was contemplating another visit to the
buttery-hatch or ticket-office window, the door opened and
my friend, or enemy, appeared.</p>

<p>"Be pleased to enter, Monsieur," said he suavely, and I,
for some reason, or for no reason, bethought me of a poem
of childhood's happy days, entitled, "The Spider and the
Fly," as I entered a large, bare orderly-room.</p>

<p>But it was no spider that I encountered within, but a
courtly and charming gentleman of the finest French type. I
know nothing of his history, but I am very sure that he was
of those who are "born," as the French say, and that if,
in the Terror, his great-grandfather did not perish on the
guillotine, it was not because he wasn't an aristocrat.</p>

<p>He was a white-haired, white-moustached, handsome man,
dressed in a close-fitting black tunic and baggy red
over-alls with a broad black stripe. His cuffs were adorned
with bands of gold and of silver braid, and his sleeves
with the five <i>galons</i> of a Colonel.</p>

<p>"A recruit for the Legion, <i>mon Commandant,</i>" said the
Sergeant-Major, and stood stiffly at attention.</p>

<p>The Colonel looked up from the desk at which he was
writing, as, entering, I bared my head and bowed; he
rose and extended his hand, with a friendly and charming
smile.</p>

<p>Not thus, thought I, do British colonels welcome
recruits to the ranks of their regiments.</p>

<p>"And you, too, wish to enlist in our Foreign Legion, do
you?" he said as we shook hands. "Has England started an
export trade in the best of her young men? I don't see many
Englishmen here from year's end to year's end, but you,
<i>mon enfant,</i> are the third this week!"</p>

<p>My heart gave a bound of hopeful joy....</p>

<p>"Anything like me, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Au bout des ongles,</i>" was the reply. "Were they your
brothers by any chance?... But I will ask no indiscreet
questions."</p>

<p>I felt happier than I had done since I had kissed
Isobel.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>mon Commandant,</i>" I replied. "I wish to become a
soldier of France if you will have me."</p>

<p>"And do you understand what you are doing, Monsieur!"
asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"I have read the placard outside," said I.</p>

<p>"It is not quite all set forth there," he smiled. "The
life is a very hard one. I would urge no one to adopt it,
unless he were a born soldier and actually desirous of a
life of discipline, adventure, and genuine hardship."</p>

<p>No, this certainly was not a case of the spider and the
fly&mdash;or it was an entirely new one, wherein the spider
discouraged flies from entering the web.</p>

<p>"I wish to join, sir," I said. "I have heard something
of the life in the Sahara from an officer of Spahis, whom I
once knew."</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled again.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mon enfant,</i>" said he, "but you won't be an
officer of Spahis, you see.... Nor an officer of the Legion
either, except after some very long and lean years in the
ranks and as a non-commissioned officer."</p>

<p>"One realises that one must begin at the bottom, <i>mon
Commandant,</i>" I replied.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;listen then," said the Colonel, and he
recited what he evidently knew by heart from frequent
repetition.</p>

<p>"The <i>engagement volontaire</i> for <i>La Légion Étrangère</i>
is for five years, in Algiers, or any other French colony,
and the pay is a <i>sou</i> a day. A <i>légionnaire</i> can re-
enlist at the end of the five years, and again at the end
of ten years. At the end of fifteen years he is eligible
for a pension varying according to his rank. A foreigner,
on completion of five years' service, can claim to be
naturalised as a French subject.... You understand all
that, <i>mon enfant?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, I thank you, <i>mon Commandant,</i>" I replied.</p>

<p>"Mind," continued the Colonel, "I say nothing of what is
understood by the term 'service' in the Legion. It is not
all pure soldiering at times.</p>

<p>"Nor do I say anything as to the number of men who
survive to claim the pension...."</p>

<p>"I am not thinking of the pension, <i>mon Commandant,</i>"
I replied; "nor of the alleged 'pay,' so much as of a
soldier's life, fighting, adventure, experience...."</p>

<p>"Ah, there is plenty of that," said the Colonel. "Plenty
of that. It is a real military school and offers the good
soldier great and frequent chances of distinction, glory,
decoration, and promotion. Some of our most famous generals
have been in the Legion, and several of the highest and
most distinguished officers of the Legion began their
career in its ranks.... Also, if you can show that you
have been an officer in the army of your own country, you
can begin as a probationary-corporal, and avoid the ranks
altogether."</p>

<p>"Please accept me as a recruit, <i>mon Commandant,</i>" said
I.</p>

<p>"Ah, we'll see first what the doctor has to say about
you&mdash;though there is little doubt about <i>that,</i> I
should think," smiled the Colonel, and pulled a form
towards him.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"John Smith," said I.</p>

<p>"Age?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-one years" (to be on the safe side).</p>

<p>"Nationality English?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>mon Commandant.</i>"</p>

<p>"Very well. If you pass the doctor I shall see you
again. <i>Au</i> '<i>voir, Monsieur,</i>" and with a curt nod to the
Sergeant-Major, the Colonel resumed his writing.</p>

<p>The Sergeant-Major opened the door with a still suave
"This way, if you please, Monsieur," and led me across
the passage into a room already tenanted by half a dozen
civilians, whom I rightly supposed to be fellow-recruits
for the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>I got a fleeting impression of seedy, poorer-class
people, two being brush-haired, fair, fattish, and
undoubtedly German, before the Sergeant-Major, opening
another door in this waiting-room, motioned me to enter a
small closet, from which another door led elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Remove <i>all</i> clothing, please," said the
Sergeant-Major, and shut me in.</p>

<p>This was unpleasant but presumably unavoidable, and
I obeyed. Before I had begun to shiver, the second
door opened and I was invited to submit myself to the
close and searching investigations of an undergrown but
over-nourished gentleman, from beneath whose white surgical
smock appeared the baggy red trousers of the French
army.</p>

<p>This official, presumably an army-surgeon, was easily
able to establish the belief in my mind that <i>his</i>
ancestors had not perished on the guillotine. (Certainly
not during the Terror, anyhow). More probably they danced
round it, or possibly operated it.</p>

<p>When he had quite finished with my vile body, he bade me
replace it in the closet, clothe it, and remove it with all
speed. This, nothing loth, I did, and was re-conducted by
the Sergeant-Major to the Colonel's office.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>mon enfant,</i>" smiled the old officer, "you are
accepted."</p>

<p>"And can I enlist at once, sir!" I enquired eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not until you have slept on it," was the reply. "Come
here again to-morrow morning, if you are still of the same
mind, and I will enrol you. But think well&mdash;think
well. And remember that, until you sign your name on the
form which I shall give you to-morrow, you are absolutely
free, and have committed yourself in no way whatsoever.
Think well&mdash;think well...."</p>

<p>And thanking him gratefully, I went from the room,
hoping that all French officers were of this stamp,
as kindly and as truly gentlemanly. My hope was not
fulfilled.</p>

<p>In the corridor, the Sergeant-Major observed, "I
sincerely hope Monsieur will return," and as I assured him,
with thanks, that I should do so, I fancied, rightly or
wrongly, that his smile was a little mocking.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">Emerging from the stuffy gloom, I walked
down the Rue St. Dominique with a light, gay step. I could
have danced along, whistling and singing, for I felt
practically certain that Michael and Digby were but a day
or two ahead of me upon this romantic road, and that I
might overtake them at any moment. Probably they were both
still in France, possibly in Paris. Once I rejoined them,
I should no longer feel this deadly loneliness, and should
have someone to whom to talk about Isobel.</p>

<p>Journeys end in lovers' meetings&mdash;and but for this
separation from her, there would not be the immeasurable
joy of our reunion.</p>

<p>Really I ought to be very thankful and very happy. I was
about to rejoin Michael and Digby, and to live with them
again; Isobel loved me and was awaiting my return; and I
was on the threshold of a great adventure in an unknown
foreign land.</p>

<p>Knowing that I should, after to-morrow morning, live at
the charges of <i>Madame la République</i> (albeit she seemed
of a careful and economical turn of mind), my funds were
ample, and I would take a <i>fiacre</i> back to the fashionable
quarter and spend the rest of my last day of freedom in
sight-seeing and idleness.</p>

<p>I would sit in the Tuileries Gardens, visit the Louvre,
look in the shops, have an outdoor meal in the Bois, and
generally behave as does the tourist who has a few hours
and a few francs to spend.</p>

<p>I carried out my programme, whiled away the day, and
crept up to my bedroom at night, too tired for anything but
the blessed dreamless sleep of healthy youth.</p>

<p>In the morning I paid my bill and departed from the
Hôtel Normandie with a curious sense of escape. I did
not in the least mind becoming a halfpenny soldier and
herding with all sorts and conditions of men; but I did
dislike being in a first-class hotel without my dinner-kit,
a change of clothes, and the small necessities of the
toilet.</p>

<p>I again drove to the Rue St. Dominique, and, on the
way, endeavoured to talk to myself as though a person of
wisdom and experience were talking to another of sense
and discretion. But I greatly fear that this is not what
happens when I address myself.</p>

<p>"You have only to stop this <i>fiacre,</i> turn about, and go
back," said I to me, "and there is no harm done. You will
still be a free man, and can go back to Brandon Abbas as
soon as you like."</p>

<p>But the only reply was, "Beau... Digby.... Stand by your
pals through thick and thin. Adventure: Romance: Success:
Fame and Fortune: and then England, Home, and Isobel..."
and much similar youthful nonsense.</p>

<p>At the <i>Bureau de Recrutement</i> I was shown into a
waiting-room by the Sergeant-Major, who observed:</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur has come back then! Good!" and smiled
unattractively. Again I was reminded of a poem of early
childhood, this time of a Lady of Riga who indulged in an
unorthodox joy-ride.</p>

<p>In the waiting-room were some of the men I had seen on
the previous day in the doctor's ante-chamber.</p>

<p>Among them were the Teutonic-looking pair, and I
thought it probable that if I suddenly called out
"<i>Waiter!</i>" or "<i>Garçon!</i>" they would both spring eagerly
forward. They looked very harmless, insignificant, and
unattractive&mdash;also terribly poor.</p>

<p>The rest were a mixed lot, Latins of sorts, apparently
with nothing in common but dire poverty. They did not seem
in the least ruffianly nor criminal, but just ordinary
working-men, desperately poor, and as anxious and worried
as hungry, homeless people always are.</p>

<p>It was rather curious to feel that whereas, a few
minutes ago, I had been a little uncomfortable by reason
of my sartorial deficiencies, I now felt uncomfortable at
being so obviously a fashionably-clad and well-nourished
member of a wholly different class.</p>

<p>My well-cut and fairly-new clothing seemed to mock the
rags and general seediness of these poor fellows, my future
comrades&mdash;all of whom would very probably prove much
tougher soldiers than I should.</p>

<p>Before long, the Sergeant-Major returned and bade me
follow him to the Colonel's office.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mon enfant,</i>" said the old soldier, as I entered
and bowed, "so you have not thought better of it, eh? Well,
well, you must now do as you please."</p>

<p>"I wish to enlist, <i>mon Commandant,</i>" I replied.</p>

<p>"Then read this form and sign it," he said, with a
distinct sigh. "Remember though, that as soon as you have
done so, you will be a soldier of France, entirely amenable
to martial law, and without any appeal whatsoever. Your
friends cannot possibly buy you out, and your Consul cannot
help you, for five years. Nothing but death can remove you
from the Legion."</p>

<p>I glanced over the grey printed form, a contract by
which the signatory undertook to serve the French Republic
for five years, as a soldier in the <i>Légion Étrangère.</i></p>

<p>Five years was a long time&mdash;but Isobel would only
be twenty-three at the end of it, and if Michael and Digby
had done this, I could do the same.... It would be nice to
return, a Colonel at twenty-five, and take Isobel to my
regiment.... I signed my name.</p>

<p>"A little error, <i>mon enfant?</i>" smiled the Colonel, on
reading my signature. "Or you prefer this <i>nom-de-guerre,</i>
doubtless?"</p>

<p>I had written "J. Geste"!</p>

<p>Blushing and looking a fool, I asked to be allowed to
change my mind and put my own name, and the kindly old
gentleman, tearing up the form, gave me another which I
signed "John Smith."</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, listen to me," said the Colonel. "You
are a duly enlisted soldier of France and must join your
regiment at once. If you do not do so, you will be treated
as a deserter. You are to catch the Marseilles train from
the Gare de Lyon this evening&mdash;nine-fifteen&mdash;and
report yourself to the noncommissioned officer whom you
will see waiting at the Marseilles terminus. Should you
fail to find him, ask any <i>gendarme</i> to direct you to Fort
St. Jean, and report yourself there. Don't forget. Fort
St. Jean, the military depôt," and he rose and extended
his hand. "I wish you good luck and quick promotion, <i>mon
enfant,</i>" he added. "Is there anything else I can tell
you?"</p>

<p>"Do you always advise applicants to think better of it,
sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me a little sharply.</p>

<p>"I am not here to deter people from joining the Foreign
Legion," he said.... "But some strike me as better suited
to the life than others," he added, with a kindly shake of
the hand. "Good-bye and good luck."</p>

<p>I thanked him and turned to commence my "ride on the
Tiger" (along the Path of Glory).</p>

<p>"Come with me, recruit," said the Sergeant-Major, as he
closed the door, "and move smartly."</p>

<p>In his office, he made out a railway-warrant for
Marseilles, and a form that proclaimed the bearer to be
John Smith, a soldier of the Legion, proceeding to the
depôt in Algeria. He then unlocked a drawer, produced a
cash-box, and doled out three francs on to the table.</p>

<p>"Subsistence-money, recruit," said he. "A squandering of
public funds. Three <i>sous</i> would be ample."</p>

<p>I added two francs to them.</p>

<p>"Let us part friends, Sergeant-Major," said I, for I
hate leaving ill-feeling behind me if I can avoid it.</p>

<p>"Recruit," replied he, pocketing the money, "you will
get on.... <i>If</i> you respect and please all Sergeant-Majors.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>And once more I found myself in the Rue St. Dominique,
but no longer a free man. I had, with my own hand,
padlocked about my ankle a chain unbreakable, the other end
of which was somewhere in the desert of Sahara.</p>

<p>Having burnt my boats, I was quite anxious to push
on, and I found myself deciding to go by the next train,
instead of waiting till the evening. Had I realised that
I was to sit for eighteen hours on an uncushioned wooden
seat, I might have felt less eager. Eighteen hours the
journey did last, however, and each hour more wearisome
than the one before. I think the train must have visited
every town and village in France, and the entire population
have clattered noisily into my ancient, uncomfortable,
unclean compartment, throughout the night. Certainly I
reached Marseilles feeling ancient, uncomfortable, and
unclean myself; and, unlike the compartment, very empty.</p>

<p>It was a wretched journey, rendered no pleasanter by
the attentions of the guard, who, having seen from my
railway-warrant that I was going to the Legion, behaved
somewhat in the manner of a clever captor and skilful
gaoler.</p>

<p>He was of a type of Frenchman that I do not like (there
are several of them), and though he refrained from actual
reproaches and abuse, he made it clear to me that I could
not escape him, and to my fellow-travellers that they had
a possible danger in their midst. Not precisely a convict;
nor, so far as he actually <i>knew,</i> an ex-convict; but
still, one who was going to join the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>On arrival at the terminus, this worthy soul saved me
the trouble of finding my non-commissioned officer, by
himself finding the man and handing me over to him, with
the air of one who has deserved well of his country and of
his kind.</p>

<p>"There!" said he to the Sergeant. "There he is! Another
little bird for your cage," and so depressed was I by
hunger, sleeplessness, and aching bones that I so far
departed from good manners and the equal mind as to say:</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake don't be such a funny little fat
ass," but as I spoke in English he may have thought that I
did but offer felicitations and regards.</p>

<p>I rather liked the look of the Sergeant. He was a
dapper, alert person, and his bronzed face, though hard as
iron, was not brutal nor vicious. He struck me as looking
uncommonly like a man. He wore the usual uniform of the
French infantry, but with a broad blue woollen sash round
the waist, green epaulettes instead of red, and Zouave
trousers.</p>

<p>Looking me over with a cold official stare, he asked
me if I spoke French, and demanded my name, papers, and
nationality.</p>

<p>"Another Englishman," he remarked to my intense joy.
"Well&mdash;it might have been worse."</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" he enquired, and finding that I was, so
far as I knew, bade me follow him.</p>

<p>Surely Michael and Digby were here, and I should see
them in the next few minutes. I cheered up tremendously.</p>

<p>He led the way out of the station and down into the
busy street and the exhilarating air and sunshine of
Marseilles.</p>

<p>By the side of the taciturn Sergeant I walked, longing
to ask him about the "other Englishmen," whose recent
arrival he had implied by his exclamation, on hearing my
nationality.</p>

<p>But his manner did not encourage polite converse,
and, truth to tell, I had an even deeper longing at
the moment&mdash;for the appeasement of a very healthy
appetite.</p>

<p>I waxed diplomatic.</p>

<p>"A Sergeant would not share a bottle of wine with a
recruit, I suppose, Monsieur?" I asked as we passed an
attractive-looking café, from beneath whose gay striped
awnings marble-topped tables and comfortable cane chairs
shrieked an invitation to rest and refreshment.</p>

<p>"He would not, <i>bleu,</i>" was the reply. "Not only from
a natural sense of superiority, but also because it would
be against the regulations. Neither is he addressed as
'Monsieur.' He has a military rank, and he is saluted
by those who address him.... Some Sergeants, properly
approached, might refresh themselves, perhaps, while a
deserving <i>bleu</i> did the same...."</p>

<p>I halted and saluted as though he were an officer.
(Correct procedure in the French army, I found.)</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur le Sergent,</i>" said I, "will you honour me by
drinking a glass of wine at this restaurant while I get
some food? I am very hungry," and I produced a five-franc
piece.</p>

<p>"Be here in quarter of an hour, <i>bleu,</i>" was the reply,
and taking the coin the Sergeant crossed the road to a
wine-shop, as I promptly dived into the café and hungrily
devoured my last civilian meal&mdash;an excellent one in
every detail, down to the crisp rolls, fresh butter, and
coffee worthy of the name.</p>

<p>I rose, feeling what Digby would call "a better and a
wider man."</p>

<p>Sauntering out under the awning, and seeing nothing of
my Sergeant, I sat me down, filled and lighted my pipe, and
gazed about me. Fortified and refreshed, I felt by no means
unhappy.</p>

<p>I had not long feasted my eyes upon the novel and
interesting scene provided by the thronged thoroughfare,
when the Sergeant, crossing the road, approached. I rose
promptly, saluted smartly, and fell in beside him.</p>

<p>He eyed my clothes.</p>

<p>"Have you any more money, <i>bleu?</i>" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant," I replied, feeling a little
disappointed in him.</p>

<p>"Because if you have not, I shall return you three
francs," quoth he.</p>

<p>I assured him that this was wholly unnecessary, though a
very kindly thought&mdash;and regretted my suspicions.</p>

<p>"Well, I will give you some good advice instead then,"
said the worthy man.</p>

<p>I thanked him sincerely.</p>

<p>"Beware the Algerian wine then," he began. "The blessing
and the curse of the army of Africa. I have just drunk two
bottles of it. Excellent.... Beware of women, the blessing
and the curse of all men. I have married three of them.
Terrible...."</p>

<p>I gave my solemn promise to beware, to be very ware, and
neither to drink nor to marry to excess.</p>

<p>"Secondly, <i>bleu,</i>" he went on, "when things are bad, do
not make them worse, for they will be quite bad enough."</p>

<p>This also seemed sound advice, and I said so.</p>

<p>"And, thirdly&mdash;resist the decrees of Heaven if you
will, but not those of your Corporal.... Of course, no one
would dream of resisting the will of a Sergeant."</p>

<p>I agreed that no sane person would do this.</p>

<p>"Of course!... But it is when you are insane that you
must be careful," warned my mentor.</p>

<p>"Insane?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>bleu,</i>" was the reply. "All good <i>légionnaires</i>
go insane at times. Then they are apt to do one of <i>the</i>
three horrible things. Kill themselves, kill their
comrades, or defy a Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Why should they go insane?" I enquired in some
alarm.</p>

<p>"They shouldn't, but they do," said my mentor. "We call
it <i>le cafard.</i> The cockroach. It crawls round and round
in the brain, and the greater the heat, the monotony,
the hardship, the overwork, the over-marching, and the
drink&mdash;the faster goes the beetle and the more it
tickles.... Then the man says, '<i>J'ai le cafard,</i>' and
runs amok, or commits suicide, or deserts, or defies a
Sergeant.... Terrible.... And do you know what is the egg
of this beetle? No? It is absinthe. Absinthe is the uncle
and aunt of the grandparents of <i>cafard.</i> It is the vilest
poison. Avoid it. I know what I am saying. I was brought
up on it.... Terrible.... I had some just now, after my
wine...."</p>

<p>I promised never to look on the absinthe when it was
green, nor, indeed, when it was any other colour.</p>

<p>"Then you will not get real <i>cafard,</i>" continued the
worthy man, "and you will not kill a comrade nor defy a
Sergeant. You will only commit suicide, or desert and die
in the desert."</p>

<p>"Did you ever do any of these terrible things, <i>Monsieur
le Sergent?</i>" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, <i>bleu.</i> I did not even commit suicide," was the
reply. "I merely shaved my head, painted it red, white, and
blue, and was thus esteemed as a true patriot."</p>

<p>I began to think that two bottles of wine and an
unspecified quantity of absinthe had stimulated the
Sergeant's imagination, but learnt later that what he told
me was absolutely true. (When engaged in repainting one of
the striped sentry boxes of the barracks or the outpost
where he was stationed, he had painted one side of his
shaven head red and the other side blue, and separated
these colours with a broad white stripe. This had drawn
attention to him, and he had riveted that attention by
desperate courage and resource during the operations and
battle of Cinq Palmiers.)</p>

<p>"And what can one do to escape <i>le cafard?</i>" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the discouraging reply. "Mental
occupation is good, and promotion is better. But in the
desert, while the Arab finds two things, the European finds
three. They are there, and, therefore, there they are
...."</p>

<p>I tried to look intelligent and enquiring.</p>

<p>"The Arab inevitably finds sun and sand&mdash;too much
of both. The European inevitably finds sun, sand, and
madness&mdash;too much of all three," he went on. "This
madness is in the air, I suppose, or in the sun's rays. I
do not know, even I, although I know so much. And now you
have talked more than is seemly. Silence, <i>bleu....</i>"</p>

<p>And I was silent, though inclined to ask why he
addressed me as "<i>bleu.</i>" I did not feel particularly blue,
and I was quite sure I did not look blue in the slightest
degree. (Later I learnt that it is French army-slang for a
recruit, and has as much or little meaning as the English
name of "rookie" for the same class of soldier.) The use
of my tongue being now prohibited, I used my eyes instead,
and enjoyed the marvellous panorama of the Marseilles
waterside, where Arabs, Negroes, Levantines, Chinese,
Moors, Annamese, Indians, and the lascars and seamen of
the ships of all nations, seemed as numerous as the French
themselves.</p>

<p>I was reminded of the story of the Tower of Babel as we
made our way through the throng and round the boxes, bales,
sacks, barrels, trucks, carts, trolleys, and waggons over
which the gesticulating crowds swarmed and howled.</p>

<p>Among the sailing-ships, tramps, Oriental-looking
barques, yachts, brigs, schooners, cargo-boats, and liners,
moored along the quays, I kept looking for the English
flag, flying at the stern; and was delighted as often as my
eye fell upon it.</p>

<p>I had thought, at first, that all the ships must be
French, as each flew the Tri-couleur at the mast, until I
realised that this was complimentary to France, while the
national flag flew at the stern.</p>

<p>My head was beginning to ache with the noise,
heat, hustle, and eye-strain, when we arrived at our
destination, a mediæval fort on the water's edge, obsolete
and dilapidated, with an ancient lighthouse tower, and a
drawbridge, leading over a moat to a great door.</p>

<p>One half expected to see that the sentries were
halberdiers in breastplate and jerkin, trunk hose, and
peaked morion....</p>

<p>"Here we are, and hence&mdash;we are here," observed my
Sergeant.... "Good-bye, <i>bleu,</i> and may the devil admire
you."</p>

<p>"The same to you, Sergeant, and very many thanks," I
replied.</p>

<p>To the Sergeant of the Guard at the gate he merely
remarked, "Recruit. Legion. Poor devil!" and turning,
departed, and I saw him no more.</p>

<p>"Follow me, you," said the Sergeant of the Guard, and
led the way along prison-like stone corridors, damp,
mouldering, echoing, and very depressing.</p>

<p>Halting at a door, he opened it, jerked his thumb in the
direction of the interior, and shut the door behind me as I
entered.</p>

<p>I was in my first French barrack-room.</p>

<p>Round the walls stood a score or so of cots and a number
of benches, the remaining furniture of the room being a
big table and a stove. Round the latter, at the table, on
cots and on benches, lounged a varied assortment of men
in civilian clothes&mdash;clothes ranging from well-cut
lounge-suits to corduroy and rags.</p>

<p>Michael and Digby were not among these men, and I was
sensible of a deep feeling of bitter disappointment as I
realised the fact.</p>

<p>All these recruits looked at me, but though conscious of
their regard, I was much more conscious of the poisonous
foulness of the atmosphere of the room. It was horrible.</p>

<p>Every window was tightly shut, and every man (and the
charcoal stove) was smoking, so far as I could determine
with a rapid glance round the reeking place.</p>

<p>Presumably the men were smoking tobacco, but it was
no tobacco with which I was familiar. I was reminded of
gardeners' bonfires and smouldering rubbish.</p>

<p>Without thinking of what I was doing, I naturally and
instinctively turned to the nearest window, manfully
wrestled with it, and succeeded in throwing it open.</p>

<p>I am not in a position categorically to affirm that this
was positively the first time that a window had ever been
opened in Fort St. Jean, but it might well have been, to
judge by the interest, not to say consternation, evoked
by my simple action. What would have happened to me had a
corporal or old soldier been present, I do not know.</p>

<p>At the table a group of three or four men who were
playing cards, seemed to take umbrage at my action or my
audacity. Their ejaculations sounded like those of great
surprise mingled with resentment. One of them rose and
turned towards me.</p>

<p>"You do not like the atmosphere of our little nest,
perhaps?" he said, unpleasantly, and with a threatening and
bullying note in his voice.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, and looking him carefully up and down,
added, "Nor you either. What are you going to do about
it?"</p>

<p>This was ill-mannered of me. I admit it. I was
bringing my style to the level of this unpleasant-looking
individual. But it seemed to me to be the best level on
which to meet him. I thought it a sound plan to begin as
I meant to go on, and I had not the least intention of
allowing that going-on to include any undue Christian
meekness. I was the last person in the world to bully
anybody, and I intended to be the last person to be
bullied.</p>

<p>I did not wish to begin by making an enemy, but still
less did I wish to begin by allowing the establishment of
any sort of ascendancy on the part of a fellow-recruit.</p>

<p>"Oho! You don't like the look of me, don't you?" said
the fellow, advancing.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said I, looking him over appraisingly, and
then "staring him out" as we used to say in the nursery.</p>

<p>I could not quite "place" the individual. He certainly
was not a workman and he was not a prince in disguise.
A clerk, or shopman, probably, I thought, and learned
later that he was a French petty official named Vogué,
"rehabilitating" himself&mdash;recovering his papers
and civic rights by five years' Legion service, after
conviction of defalcation, and a light sentence.</p>

<p>"You want that window open?" he said, changing the
subject.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is intelligent," said I.</p>

<p>"Suppose I want it shut?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Come and shut it," said I, with disgraceful
truculence.</p>

<p>"Suppose we all want it shut?" he hedged.</p>

<p>"Then there is an end of the matter," I replied. "If the
majority prefer to poison themselves, they have a perfect
right to do so."</p>

<p>"Come back and be quiet, Nosey," called one of the
card-players, and he returned, grumbling.</p>

<p>I seated myself on the cot nearest to the open window,
and put my hat on the dirty straw-stuffed pillow.... What
next?</p>

<p>"Like the ceiling raised any?" enquired a quiet drawling
voice behind me, in English.</p>

<p>Turning, I regarded the ceiling.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "it will do," and studied the speaker.</p>

<p>He was lying at full length on the next cot, a very
small, clean-shaven man with a prominent nose and chin, a
steel-trap mouth, and a look of great determination and
resolution. His eyes were a very light grey, hard and
penetrating, his hair straw-coloured and stubbly, his face
sallow, lantern-jawed, and tanned. He looked a hard case
and proved to be what he looked.</p>

<p>"How did you know I was English?" I asked as he stared
thoughtfully at me.</p>

<p>"What else!" he replied, deliberately. "Pink and
white.... Own the earth.... '<i>Haw! Who's this low fellah?
Don</i>' <i>know him, do I?</i>' <i>...</i> Dude.... '<i>Open all the
windahs now I've come!</i>' <i>...</i> British!"</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"Are you an American?" I enquired.</p>

<p>"Why?" he replied.</p>

<p>"What else?" I drawled. "'<i>Sure thing, stranger.</i>'
<i>...</i> Don't care who owns the earth.... Great contempt
for the effete English.... Tar and feathers.... Stars and
Stripes.... '<i>I come from God's Own Country and I guess it
licks Creation.</i>' <i>...</i> Uneasy self-assertion...."</p>

<p>The American smiled. (I never heard him laugh.)</p>

<p>"Bo," said he, turning to the next cot, "here's a
Britisher insulting of our pore country.... Handin' out the
rough stuff.... Fierce, ain't it?"</p>

<p>A huge man slowly turned from contemplation of the
ceiling, raised his head, ceased chewing, and regarded me
solemnly. He then fainted with a heartrending groan.</p>

<p>"Killed my pard, you hev," said the little man. "He's
got a weak heart.... Damn sight weaker head though,
haven't you, Bo?" he added, turning to his friend, who had
recovered sufficiently to continue his patient mastication
either of tobacco or chewing-gum.</p>

<p>Lying there, Bo appeared to be some seven feet in
length, four in breadth, and two in depth.</p>

<p>In face he greatly resembled the small man, having the
same jutting chin, prominent nose, tight mouth, and hard
leathery face. His eyes were of a darker grey, however, and
his hair black and silky.</p>

<p>He also looked a hard case and a very bad enemy.
Conversely though, I gained the impression that he might
be a very good friend. Indeed, I liked the look of both of
them, in spite of the fact that I seemed to fill them with
a sort of amused contempt.</p>

<p>"Ses you suffers from oneasy self-insertion, Hank," went
on the little man.</p>

<p>"Ain't inserted nawthen to-day, Buddy," replied the
giant mildly. "Nary a insert. I'm oneasy in me innards, but
it ain't from what you ses, Stranger. Nope. I could insert
a whole hog right now, and never notice it."</p>

<p>"Don't go fer ter rile the Britisher, Hank, with yer
silly contradicshusness," implored the other. "He don' like
it, an' he don' like us. You don' want ter go gittin' inter
no trouble. So shet up and go on sufferin' from oneasy
self-insertion."</p>

<p>"Means well," continued the speaker, turning to me, "but
he ain't et nawthen excep' cigarette-ends for three or four
days, an' he ain't at his best."</p>

<p>I stared. Was it possible that they were really hungry?
Certainly they looked lean and haggard enough to be
starving.</p>

<p>I had felt quite bad enough an hour or two ago, after
missing a single meal.... I should have to go carefully if
I wanted to give food, and not offence.</p>

<p>"Would you gentlemen lunch with me?" I asked,
diffidently. "Brothers-in-arms and all that...."</p>

<p>Two solemn faces turned and regarded me.</p>

<p>"He's calling you a gentleman, Hank," said the little
man at length. "He don' mean no real harm though. He's
talkin' English to you.... Hark!... You listen and improve
your mind."</p>

<p>I made another effort. "Say," quoth I, "I gotta hunch
I wanta grub-stake you two hoboes to a blow-out. Guess I
can cough up the dough, if yew ain't too all-fired proud
to be pards with a dod-gasted Britisher." A good effort, I
thought.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Hank, and they rose as one man.</p>

<p>"Put it right there, son," said the big man, extending
the largest hand I have ever seen.</p>

<p>I took it, and in the crushing-match that ensued,
endeavoured to hold my own. It was a painful business,
and when I limply took the horny fist of Buddy in turn, I
was handicapped in the squeezing competition. However, I
was able to give him a worthy grip, though his hand was
stronger than mine.</p>

<p>"Where can we get something?" I asked, and Buddy said
there was certain to be a canteen about. He had never yet
heard of a case where a thirsty soldier, with money, was
not given every encouragement to get rid of it.</p>

<p>"I can't drink till I've et, pard," said Hank to me.
"'Twouldn't be right. If I drinks on an empty stummick, I
gets unreasonable if interfered with by the bulls.... Bash
a sheriff or somethin'.... When I ain't starvin', lickker
on'y makes me more and more lovin' to all mankind. Yep, I
gotta eat first."</p>

<p>"They'll have eats in the canteen," opined Buddy, "even
in this God-fersaken section."</p>

<p>At that moment, the door of the room was thrown open by
a soldier, and he entered carrying one end of a long board
on which stood a row of tin bowls. Another soldier appeared
at the other end, and together they bawled, "<i>Soupe!</i>"</p>

<p>It was invitation enough, and both the long arms of Hank
shot out, and, in a moment, he was on his bed, a bowl in
either hand.</p>

<p>Buddy followed his example.</p>

<p>I looked round. There appeared to me to be more bowls
than there were people in the room. I snatched two, before
the rush of hungry men from other parts of the room arrived
with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>This disgusting exhibition of greed on my part cannot be
excused, but may be condoned as it was not made in my own
interests. I was not hungry, and the look of the stuff was
not sufficiently tempting for me to eat for eating's sake.
By the time I reached my cot, Hank had emptied one bowl,
and was rapidly emptying the other.</p>

<p>"Gee! That's what I come to the Legion for," he said,
with a sigh of content. When he had finished, I offered him
one of my two.</p>

<p>"Fergit it," said he.</p>

<p>"I want to," said I.</p>

<p>He stared hard at me.</p>

<p>"Not hungry," I assured him.</p>

<p>"Honest Injun?" he asked doubtfully, but extending his
hand.</p>

<p>"Had a big breakfast an hour ago," said I. "I never take
soup in the middle of the morning. I got this for you and
Mr.&mdash;er..."</p>

<p>"Buddy," said the little man and took the other bowl.</p>

<p>Hank swallowed his third portion.</p>

<p>"You're shore white, pard," he said.</p>

<p>"Blowed-in-the-glass," agreed Buddy, and I felt I had
two friends.</p>

<p>A large German lumbered up gesticulating, and assailed
Hank.</p>

<p>"You eat dree!" he shouted in guttural English. "I only
eat vun! Himmel! You damn dirdy tief!"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Dutchy," said Buddy. "Don't yew stand fer
it! You beat him up. You make him put it back."</p>

<p>The German shook a useful-looking fist under Hank's
nose.</p>

<p>"I can't put it back, Dutch," said he mildly.
"'Twouldn't be manners," and, as the angry German waxed
more aggressive, he laid his huge and soupy hand upon the
fat angry face, and pushed.</p>

<p>The German staggered back and fell heavily, and sat
looking infinitely surprised.</p>

<p>"<i>Now,</i> pard," said Hank to me, "I could shore look upon
the wine without no evil effecks to nobody," and we trooped
out in search of the canteen.</p>

<p>The big gloomy quadrangle of Fort St. Jean was now
crowded with soldiers of every regiment of the army of
Africa, the famous Nineteenth Army Corps, and, for the
first time, I saw the Spahis of whom the French officer had
talked to us at Brandon Abbas.</p>

<p>Their trousers were voluminous enough to be called
skirts, in fact one leg would have provided the material
for an ample frock. Above these garments they wore sashes
that appeared to be yards in length and feet in width.
In these they rolled each other up, one man holding and
manipulating the end, while the other spun round and round
towards him, winding the sash tightly about himself as he
did so.</p>

<p>Gaudy waistcoats, zouave jackets, fez caps, and vast
scarlet cloaks completed their picturesquely barbaric
costumes.</p>

<p>Besides the Spahis were blue-and-yellow Tirailleurs,
pale blue Chasseurs d'Afrique, and red-and-blue Zouaves,
blue Colonial Infantry, as well as artillerymen, sappers,
and soldiers of the line, in their respective gay
uniforms.</p>

<p>There was a babel of noise and a confusing turmoil as
these leave-men rushed about in search of pay-corporals,
<i>fourrier-sergents,</i> kit, papers, food, and the canteen.
The place was evidently the clearing-house and military
hotel for all soldiers coming from, or returning to, the
army of Africa.</p>

<p>Following the current that flowed through this seething
whirlpool, in the direction of a suggestive-looking squad
of huge wine-casks that stood arrayed outside an open door,
we found ourselves in the canteen and the presence of the
national drink, good red wine.</p>

<p>"No rye-whiskey at a dollar a drink here, Bo," observed
Buddy, as we made our way to a zinc-covered counter, and
found that everybody was drinking claret at three-halfpence
the bottle. "Drinks are on you, pard. Set 'em up."</p>

<p>"Gee! It's what they call 'wine,'" sighed Hank. "Gotta
get used to it with the other crool de<i>pri</i>vations and
hardships," and he drained the tumbler that I filled.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> lickker, Bo," replied Buddy tolerantly, and
drained another.</p>

<p>It was, and very good liquor too. It struck me as far
better wine than one paid a good deal for at Oxford, and
good enough to set before one's guests anywhere.</p>

<p>Personally I am a poor performer with the bottle, and
regard wine as something to taste and appreciate, rather
than as a thirst-quenching beverage.</p>

<p>Also I freely confess that the sensation produced by
more than enough, or by mixing drinks, is, to me, most
distasteful.</p>

<p>I would as soon experience the giddiness caused by
spinning round and round, as the giddiness caused by
alcohol. More than a little makes me feel sick, silly,
depressed, and uncomfortable, and I have never been able to
understand the attraction that intoxication undoubtedly has
for some people.</p>

<p>It is therefore in no way to my credit that I am a
strictly sober person, and as little disposed to exceed in
wine as in cheese, pancakes, or dry toast.</p>

<p>"Quite good wine," said I to the two Americans, "but I
can't say I like it as a drink between meals."</p>

<p>I found that my companions were of one mind with me,
though perhaps for a different reason.</p>

<p>"Yep," agreed Buddy. "Guess they don't allow no
intoxicatin' hard lickkers in these furrin canteens."</p>

<p>"Nope," remarked Hank. "We gotta swaller this an' be
thankful. P'r'aps we kin go out an' have a drink when we
git weary-like.... Set 'em up again, Bo," and I procured
them each his third bottle.</p>

<p>"You ain't drinkin', pard," said Buddy, eyeing my
half-emptied first glass.</p>

<p>"Not thirsty," I replied.</p>

<p>"Thirsty?" said Hank. "Don' s'pose there's any water
here if you was," and feeling I had said the wrong thing,
covered my confusion by turning away and observing the
noisy, merry throng, drinking and chattering around me.
They were a devil-may-care, hard-bitten, tough-looking
crowd, and I found myself positively looking forward to
being in uniform and one of them.</p>

<p>As I watched, I saw a civilian coming from the door
towards us. I had noticed him in the barrack-room. Although
dressed in an ill-fitting, shoddy, shabby blue suit, a
velvet tam-o'-shanter, burst shoes, and apparently nothing
else, he looked like a soldier. Not that he had by any
means the carriage of an English guardsman&mdash;far from
it&mdash;but his face was a soldier's, bronzed, hard,
disciplined, and of a family likeness to those around.</p>

<p>Coming straight to us, he said pleasantly, and with only
the slightest foreign accent:</p>

<p>"Recruits for the Legion?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Would you care to exchange information for a bottle?"
he asked politely, with an ingratiating smile which did not
extend to his eyes.</p>

<p>"I should be delighted if you will drink with us," I
replied, and put a two-franc piece on the counter.</p>

<p>He chose to think that the money was for him to accept,
and not for the fat little man behind the bar to change.</p>

<p>"You are a true comrade," said the new-comer, "and
will make a fine <i>légionnaire.</i> There are a dozen bottles
here," and he spun the coin. "Now ask me anything you want
to know," and he included the two stolid Americans in the
graceful bow with which he concluded. He was evidently an
educated and cultured person and not English.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Hank. "I wants ter know when we gits our
next eats."</p>

<p>"An' if we can go out and git a drink," added Buddy.</p>

<p>"You'll get <i>soupe,</i> bread, and coffee at about four
o'clock, and you won't be allowed to leave here for any
purpose whatever until you are marched down to the boat for
Oran," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>His hearers pursed their lips in stolid silence.</p>

<p>"When will that be?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To-morrow by the steam-packet, unless there is a
troopship going the day after," answered the new-comer.
"They ship the Legion recruits in&mdash;ah&mdash; dribbles?
dribblings? driblets? Yes, driblets&mdash;by every boat
that goes."</p>

<p>"Suppose a friend of mine joined a day or two before
me," I asked, "where would he be now, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"He is at Fort St. Thérèse at Oran now," was the reply.
"And may go on to Saida, or Sidi-bel-Abbès to-morrow or the
next day. Sidi, probably, if he is a strong fellow."</p>

<p>"Say, you're a walking encyclopedestrian," remarked
Buddy, eyeing the man speculatively, and perhaps with more
criticism than approval.</p>

<p>"I can tell you anything about the Legion," replied
the man in his excellent refined English&mdash;about
which there was no accent such as that of a Londoner,
north-countryman, or yokel, but only a slight foreign
suggestion&mdash;"I am an old <i>légionnaire,</i> rejoining
after five years' service and my discharge."</p>

<p>"Speaks well for the Legion," I remarked cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Or ill for the chance of an ex-<i>légionnaire</i> to get a
crust of bread," he observed, less cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Been up against it, son?" asked Hank.</p>

<p>"Starved. Tramped my feet off. Slept in the mud. Begged
myself hoarse&mdash; for work.... Driven at last to choose
between gaol and the Legion.... I chose the Legion, for
some reason.... Better the devils that you know than flee
to the devils that you know not of...."</p>

<p>"Guy seems depressed," said Hank.</p>

<p>"May I finish your wine!" went on the man. "It would be
a sin to waste it."</p>

<p>"Pray do," said I, surprised; and reminded myself that I
was no longer at Oxford.</p>

<p>"You speak wonderful English," I remarked.</p>

<p>"I do," was the reply; "but better Italian, Hindustani,
and French. Legion French, that is."</p>

<p>"An' how's that, ole hoss?" enquired Buddy.</p>

<p>"Father an Italian pastry-cook in Bombay. Went to an
English school there, run by the Jesuit Fathers. Talked
Hindustani to my ayah. Mother really talked it better
than anything else, being what they call a country-bred.
Daughter of an English soldier and an Eurasian girl.
Got my French in the Legion, of course," explained the
stranger.</p>

<p>And then I was unfortunate, in that I partly blundered
and partly was misunderstood. What I meant to say, for the
sake of being conversational, was:</p>

<p>"And how did you come to find yourself in Africa, so
very far from home?" or something chatty like that. What I
actually did say was:</p>

<p>"Why did you join the Legion?" which sounded very
bald.</p>

<p>"For the same reason that <i>you</i> did. For my health," was
the sharp reply, accompanied by a cold stare.</p>

<p>I had done that which is not done.</p>

<p>"And did you find it&mdash;healthy?" enquired Buddy.</p>

<p>"Not exactly so much heal<i>thy</i> as hel<i>lish,</i>" replied
the Italian in brief and uncompromising style, as he
drained his glass (or perhaps mine).</p>

<p>We all three plied him with questions, and learned much
that was useful and more that was disturbing. We also
gathered that the gentleman was known as Francesco Boldini
to his friends, though he did not say by what name the
police knew him.</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that I did not like him
extraordinarily much; but that in view of his previous
experience he would be an exceedingly useful guide,
philosopher, and friend, whose knowledge of the ropes would
be well worth purchasing.</p>

<p>I wished I could send him on ahead for the benefit of
my brothers, who had, I felt certain, come this way two
or three days before me. Indeed, I refused to believe
otherwise or to face the fact of my crushing disappointment
and horrible position if they had not done so. I was
aroused from thoughts of what might, and might not, be
before me by a tremendous uproar as the artillerymen
present united in roaring their regimental song:</p>

<blockquote> "<i>Si vous voulez jouir des plaisirs de la
vie,<br> Engagez vous ici, et dans l'artillerie.<br> Quand
l'artilleur de Metz change de garnison,<br> Toutes les
femmes de Metz se mettent au balcon.<br> Artilleur, mon
vieux frère,<br> À ta santé vidons nos verres;<br> Et
répétons ce gai refrain:<br> Vivent les Artilleurs; à bas
les fantassins</i>..." </blockquote>

<p>and much more.</p>

<p>When they had finished and cheered themselves hoarse, a
little scoundrelly-looking fellow sprang on a barrel and
sang a remarkably seditious and disloyal ditty, of which
the chorus, apparently known to all, was:</p>

<blockquote> "<i>Et quand il faut servir ce bon Dieu de
République,<br> Où tout le monde est soldat malgré son
consentement.<br> On nous envoie grossir les Bataillons
d'Afrique,<br> À cause que les Joyeux n'aiment pas le
gouvernement,<br> C'est nous les Joyeux,<br> Les petits
Joyeux,<br> Les petits marlous Joyeux qui n'ont pas froid
aux yeux....</i>"<br> </blockquote>

<p>At the conclusion of this song of the battalion of
convicted criminals (known as the <i>Bataillon d'Infanterie
Légère d'Afrique,</i> or, more familiarly, as the "<i>Bat
d'Af</i>"<i>),</i> the men of the Colonial Infantry, known as
<i>Marsouins,</i> lifted up their voices in their regimental
song. These were followed by others, until I think
I heard all the famous marching-songs of the French
army&mdash;including that of the Legion, sung by Boldini.
It was all very interesting indeed, but in time I had had
enough of it....</p>

<p>When we returned to the barrack-room, on the advice of
Boldini, to be in time for the evening meal, I formally
retained that experienced and acquisitive gentleman as
guide, courier, and mentor, with the gift of ten francs and
the promise of such future financial assistance as I could
give and he should deserve.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I cannot spare more just at present,"
said I, in unnecessary apology for the smallness of the
retaining fee; and his reply was illuminating.</p>

<p>"Ten francs, my dear sir," he said, "is precisely two
hundred days' pay to a <i>légionnaire....</i> Seven months'
income. Think of it!"...</p>

<p>And I thought of it.</p>

<p>Decidedly I should need considerable promotion before
being in a position to marry and live in comfort on my
pay....</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">"Dinner," that evening, at about five
o'clock, consisted of similar "<i>soupe,</i>" good greyish
bread, and unsweetened, milkless coffee. The first came, as
before, in tin basins, called "<i>gamelles</i>"<i>;</i> the second
was thrown to us from a basket; and the coffee was dipped
from a pail, in tin mugs.</p>

<p>The <i>soupe</i> was a kind of stew, quite good and
nourishing, but a little difficult to manipulate without
spoon or fork. I found that my education was, in this
respect, inferior to that of my comrades. After this
meal&mdash;during which the German eyed our party
malevolently, and Vogué, the gentleman who had objected
to my opening the window, alluded to me as a "sacred
<i>nicodème,</i>" whatever that may be&mdash;there was nothing
to do but to adjourn once more to the canteen.</p>

<p>Here it was my privilege to entertain the whole band
from the barrack-room, and I was interested to discover
that both the German, whose name proved to be Glock, and
the unpleasing Vogué, were both charmed to accept my
hospitality, and to drown resentment, with everything else,
in wine.</p>

<p>It is quite easy to be lavishly hospitable with wine at
about a penny a pint.</p>

<p>Fun grew fast and furious, and I soon found that I was
entertaining a considerable section of the French army, as
well as the Legion's recruits.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the evening, and was smitten upon
the back, poked in the ribs, wrung by the hand, embraced
about the neck, and, alas, kissed upon both cheeks by
Turco, Zouave, Tirailleur, Artilleur, Marsouin, and Spahi,
even before the battalion of bottles had been routed by the
company of men.</p>

<p>I noticed that Boldini waxed more foreign, more voluble,
and more unlovable, the more he drank.</p>

<p>If he could do anything else like a gentleman, he
certainly could not carry his wine like one.</p>

<p>"Sah!" he hiccupped to me, with a strident laugh,
"farmerly arlso there were a gross of bahtles and few men,
and now arlso there are only gross men and a few bahtles!"
and he smote me on the back to assist me to understand the
jest. The more he went to pieces under the influence of
liquor, the more inclined was I to think he had a larger
proportion of Oriental strain than he pretended.</p>

<p>I liked him less and less as the evening wore on, and I
liked him least when he climbed on the zinc-covered counter
and sang an absolutely vile song, wholly devoid of humour
or of anything else but offence. I am bound to admit,
however, that it was very well received by the audience.</p>

<p>"What you t'ink of <i>thatt,</i> sah?" he enquired, when he
had finished.</p>

<p>I replied that I preferred not to think of it, and
proposed to address him in future as Cloaca Maxima.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hank and Buddy, those taciturn, observant,
non-committal, and austerely-tolerant Americans, made hay
while the sun of prosperity shone, drank more than any two
of the others, said nothing, and seemed to wonder what
all the excitement was about, and what made the "pore
furriners" noisy.</p>

<p>"Ennybody 'ud think the boobs hed bin drinkin',"
observed Buddy at last, breaking a long silence (his
own silence, that is, of course). To which remark Hank
replied:</p>

<p>"They gotta pretend thisyer wine-stuff is a hard drink,
an' act like they got a whiskey-jag an' was off the
water-waggon. Only way to keep their sperrits up.... Wise
guys too. You'd shore think some of 'em had bin drinkin'
lickker....</p>

<p>"Gee!... There's 'Taps!" he added, as the "Lights out"
bugle blew in the courtyard, and the company broke up,
"an' we gotta go to bed perishin' o' thirst, fer want of a
drink...."</p>

<p>Back to our barrack-room we reeled, singing joyously.</p>

<p>As I sat on my cot undressing, a little later, Buddy
came over to me and said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Got 'ny money left, pard?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Certainly," I replied. "You're most welcome
to..."</p>

<p>"Welcome nix," was the reply. "If you got 'ny money
left, shove it inside yer piller an' tie the end
up&mdash;or put it inside yer little vest an' lie on
it...."</p>

<p>"Hardly necessary, surely?" said I. "Looks rather unkind
and suspicious, you know...."</p>

<p>"Please yerself, pard, o' course," replied Buddy, "and
let Mister Oompara Tarara Cascara Sagrada get it," and he
glanced meaningly at Boldini, who was lying, fully dressed,
on his cot.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," said I, "he's not as bad as all
that...."</p>

<p>Buddy shrugged his shoulders and departed.</p>

<p>"I gotta evil mind," he remarked as he did so.</p>

<p>I finished undressing, got into the dirty sheetless bed,
put my money under my pillow, and then lay awake for a long
time, dreaming of Isobel, of Brandon Abbas, and, with a
sense of utter mystification, of the wretched "Blue Water"
and its mysterious fate....</p>

<p>Only last Wednesday.... Only eight people&mdash;one of
whom it obviously must be.... A wretched vulgar thief....
And where were Michael and Digby now? Were they together,
and only forty-eight hours ahead of me on the Path of
Glory, which, according to Boldini, led to the grave with
a certainty and a regularity bordering upon monotony?... I
fell asleep....</p>

<p>I was awakened in the morning by the shrilling of
bugles.</p>

<p>A corporal entered the room, bawled:</p>

<p>"<i>Levez-vous donc! Levez-vous donc!</i>" at the top of his
voice, and departed.</p>

<p>I partly dressed, and then felt beneath my pillow for my
money.</p>

<p>It was not there.</p>

<p>I felt savage and sick.... Robbed!... The beastly
curs....</p>

<p>"Here it is," said the voice of Buddy behind me.
"Thought I'd better mind it when I aheered yore
nose-sighs.... Shore enuff, about four a.m. this morning,
over comes Mister Cascara Sagrada to see how youse agettin'
on.... '<i>All right, Bo,</i>' ses I, speakin' innercent in me
slumbers, '<i>I'm amindin</i>' <i>of it,</i>' I ses...."</p>

<p>"No?" said I, "not really?"</p>

<p>"You betcha," replied Buddy, "an' Mister Cascara Sagrada
says, '<i>Oh, I thought somebody might try to rob him,</i>' he
says.... '<i>So did I,</i>' I says, '<i>And I was right too,</i>' I
says, an' the skunk scoots back to his hole."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Buddy," I said, feeling foolish, as I took the
notes and coins.</p>

<p>"I tried to put you wise, Bo," he replied, "and now you
know."</p>

<p>Curiously enough, it did not enter my mind to doubt the
truth of what he had told me.</p>

<p>After a breakfast-lunch of <i>soupe</i> and bread, we were
ordered by a sergeant to assemble in the courtyard.</p>

<p>Here he called the roll of our names, and those of a
freshly-arrived draft of recruits; formed us in fours,
and marched us to the <i>bassin,</i> where a steamer of the
<i>Messageries Maritimes</i> line, the <i>Général Negrier,</i>
awaited us.</p>

<p>We were herded to the fo'c'sle of this aged packet, and
bidden by the corporal, who was going in charge of us, to
use the ocean freely if we should chance to feel unwell, as
it was entirely at our disposal.</p>

<p>"'We have fed our seas for a thousand years,'" thought
I, and was grateful that, on this glorious day, the sea did
not look at all hungry.</p>

<p>But if the sea were not, we soldiers of misfortune
undoubtedly were. Very hungry, indeed, and as the hours
passed, we grew still hungrier. Towards evening, the
Château d'If and the tall lighthouse having been left far
behind, murmurs on the subject of dinner began to be heard.
We loafed moodily about the well-deck, between the fo'c'sle
and the high midship bridge structure, talking both in
sorrow and in anger, on the subject of food.</p>

<p>Personally I thought very regretfully of the dining-room
at Brandon Abbas, and of the dinner that was even then
being served therein. Tantalising odours were wafted to us
from the saloon below the bridge, and our ears were not
unaware of the stimulating rattle of plates and cutlery.</p>

<p>"When shall we get something to eat?" I asked Boldini,
as he emerged from the fo'c'sle hatch.</p>

<p>"By regulations we should have had <i>soupe,</i> bread, and
half a litre of wine at five o'clock," he replied. "Quite
likely the cook is going to make a bit out of us, for these
swine often do...."</p>

<p>However, there was activity, I observed, in the cook's
galley, near the fo'c'sle&mdash;the cook-house in which the
sailors' food was prepared&mdash;so we hoped for the best
while fearing the worst.</p>

<p>An hour later, when we were an hour hungrier and
angrier, Hank's usually monumental patience had dwindled to
imperceptibility.</p>

<p>"Here, you, Cascara," quoth he, pushing into the knot of
men in the centre of which Boldini harangued them on their
rights and the cause of their present wrongs, "you know the
rules of this yer game. Why ain't we got no eats yet?"</p>

<p>"Because this thieving swine of a son of a sea-cook is
going to make a bit out of us," replied Boldini.</p>

<p>"Thet so, now?" observed Hank mildly. "Then I allow he
ain't agoin' ter live to enjy it. Nary a enjy. So he can
tell himself Good-bye, for he ain't goin' to see himself no
more, if I don't get no dinner. Nope...."</p>

<p>I gathered from Boldini that it would be quite
impossible for me to get at the corporal, as I proposed to
do, since he was away in the second-class quarters, and I
should be prevented from leaving the fo'c'sle if I tried to
do so.</p>

<p>"But I can let you have a roll," he said, "if it is
worth a franc to you. I don't want to starve, you know,"
and his pleasant smile was a little reminiscent of the
Wicked Uncle in my nursery-tale book of the Babes in the
Wood.</p>

<p>It appeared that, anticipating just what had happened,
he had secreted four rolls when breakfast was served at
Fort St. Jean that morning. I gave him three francs, and a
roll each to Hank and Buddy.</p>

<p>"You have a great soul, Boldini," I remarked, on
purchasing the bread, and was distressed at the unkindly
guffaw emitted by Buddy at my words. An hour or so
later, all signs of activity having ceased to render the
cook-house attractive, it seemed but too true that food was
not for us. The mob of recruits grumbled, complained, and
cursed in half a dozen languages. Darkness fell, and Hank
arose.</p>

<p>A huge greasy creature, grossly fat, filthily dirty
in clothes and person, and with a face that was his
misfortune, emerged from the cooking-house. He eyed us
with sourest contempt.</p>

<p>I suggested to Boldini that the scoundrel might sell us
what he ought to have given us. Boldini replied that this
was precisely what would happen, on the morrow, when we
were <i>really</i> hungry&mdash;provided we had money and chose
to pay his prices.</p>

<p>Hank strode forward.</p>

<p>"Thet Slushy?" he enquired softly.</p>

<p>"That's the swine," replied Boldini.</p>

<p>"Come and interpretate then," requested Hank, and
marched up to the cook, closely followed by Buddy.</p>

<p>"When do we get our doo an' lawful eats, Slush!" he
asked mildly.</p>

<p>The cook ignored him utterly and turned to go in lofty
silence, but a huge hand shot out and sank with the grip of
a vice into the fat of his bulging neck, another seized his
wrist, and he was run as a perambulator is run by a child,
straight to the side of the ship.</p>

<p>"Ask the pore gink if he can swim any," requested Hank,
holding the man's head over the side.</p>

<p>Boldini did so.</p>

<p>The gink kicked out viciously, but made no other
reply.</p>

<p>"Up with it, Bud&mdash;<i>attaboy!</i>" whooped Hank, and
Buddy diving at the agitated legs, gathered them in, and
raised them on to the taffrail.</p>

<p>The crowd of recruits cheered joyously.</p>

<p>I thought the man was really going overboard, and begged
them not to waste a perfectly good cook.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Hank. "He's gotta get us some grub first,"
and they threw the cook on the deck un-gently.</p>

<p>The man lumbered to his feet, and, again seizing him,
Hank ran him to the galley and threw him through the
door.</p>

<p>"<i>Cookez-vous, pronto!</i>" quoth he, and the cook seized a
heavy iron saucepan and rushed out again.</p>

<p>But alas, it was as a weapon and not as a utensil
that he wished to use it. Swinging it up with all his
strength&mdash;he found it wrenched from his hand and
placed ringingly upon his head.</p>

<p>"He's contumelious," said Hank. "He's onobedient to my
signs," and became earnest. Taking the man by the throat he
started to choke him.</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm hungry, Bo," he said to Boldini. "Tell him
he can eat outer my hand when I ain't riz by hunger.... I
gotta eat outer his pots first though."</p>

<p>Boldini assured the cook that Hank would tear him limb
from limb, and the angry crowd of recruits would see that
nobody rescued him either.</p>

<p>The fellow ceased to struggle, and Hank hurled him into
the galley.</p>

<p>A sort of ship's quartermaster, followed by a sailor,
came up, and I feared trouble. Visions of us all in irons,
awaiting a court-martial at Oran, floated before my
eyes.</p>

<p>"Assaulting the cook?" quoth the man in uniform. "Good!
Kill the thrice-accursed thieving food-spoiler, and may
<i>le bon Dieu</i> assist you."</p>

<p>I gathered that he was not very fond of Slushy.</p>

<p>"His assistance will not be required, <i>Monsieur le
Contremaître,</i>" said the smiling Boldini, and with horrible
oaths and grimaces and the worst possible grace, the cook
produced a number of loaves of bread, a pail of cold stew,
and some macaroni.</p>

<p>"We'll have that hot," announced Boldini, pointing to
the stew.</p>

<p>With very violent curses the cook said we would
not&mdash;and the crowd snarled.</p>

<p>On understanding this reply, Hank instructed Boldini
to inform the cook that unless he did precisely as he was
told, there would be great sorrow for him when we had fed.
If he were obedient he would be forgiven.</p>

<p>The stew was put over the galley-fire in a great pan.</p>

<p>"Can't he rustle a few onions and sech?" enquired Buddy,
pushing into the galley.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was a very small man, the cook gave him a
violent shove in the chest, and sent him staggering.</p>

<p>"I'll talk to you posthumorously, Cookie," said Buddy,
with ominous calm. "We wants you whole and hearty like, for
the present."</p>

<p>"Out, little dog! Out, you indescribable pollution,"
snarled the cook in French.</p>

<p>Under Boldini's instruction and Hank's compulsion, the
cook produced a string of onions and added them to the
<i>soupe.</i></p>

<p>"Watch him well, or he'll poison us," advised Glock, the
German, who, but yesterday, had called Hank a "dirdy tief"
and now appeared to love him as a brother.</p>

<p>We watched, very well, and gave every encouragement we
could think of.</p>

<p>Before long, we were squatting on the deck, each man
with a well-filled <i>gamelle</i> of excellent stew and a loaf
of bread, feeding heartily and calling blessings on Hank,
the hero of the hour. Vogué tried to kiss him.</p>

<p>Again the fat cook emerged from the galley in search of
relaxation and repose, and with a curse turned to go.</p>

<p>"He ought by rights to give us each a litre of wine,"
said Boldini. "He's got it and means to sell it."</p>

<p>"Say, Bo," shouted Hank thereupon. "Don' desert us! Did
you say it was wine or cawfee you was keeping fer us?"</p>

<p>Boldini translated.</p>

<p>"'<i>Cré bon sang!</i>" roared the cook, raising his hands
above his head, and then shaking his big dirty fist at
Boldini. "To hell with you starving gutter-scrapings! You
foul swine of the slums of Europe! You..."</p>

<p>"Sounds good!" remarked Buddy.</p>

<p>"I guess he's saying '<i>No,</i>'" opined Hank. "I'll make
signs to him agin," and he rose and strode towards the
gesticulating ruffian.</p>

<p>The cook retreated into the galley, one hand to his
throat.</p>

<p>"Look out for a knife," called Boldini.</p>

<p>But the cook was cowed, and reappeared with a wooden
bucket containing three or four quarts of wine. This he
handed to Hank with a wish that it might choke him first
and corrode his interior after.</p>

<p>He then requested Boldini to inform us that we were a
cowardly gang of apaches and wolves, who were brave enough
in a band, and slinking curs individually. He would fight
and destroy every one of us&mdash;except the big one&mdash;
and glad of the chance.</p>

<p>Boldini did so.</p>

<p>"I'm the smallest," remarked Buddy, and left it at that,
while he finished his bread and wine.</p>

<p>I am a law-abiding person by nature and by training (or
I was at that time), and regretted all this unseemliness.
But what a loathsome blackguard a man must be to swindle
hungry bewildered men (whose pay was a halfpenny a day and
who had joined the army to get it!), to rob them of their
meagre allowance of food in order that he might sell it to
them for their last coppers, when they could hold out no
longer.</p>

<p>According to Boldini it was this scoundrel's regular
custom to pretend to each draft of ignorant browbeaten
foreigners that the Government made no provision for them,
and that what they wanted they must buy from him. If they
were absolutely penniless they got precisely nothing at all
for forty-eight hours, and the cook sold their wine and
rations to other steerage passengers or to the sailors.</p>

<p>When they understood this, Hank and Buddy discussed
the advisability of "sure eradicating" the man&mdash;its
desirability being self-evident. They decided they must
leave this duty, with so many others, unperformed, as the
<i>Messageries Maritimes</i> Company might behave officiously
and prefer French law to lynch law.</p>

<p>"But I'll expostulate some with the all-fired
skunk&mdash;when we finished with him as a cook," observed
Buddy....</p>

<p>We lay on the deck propped against the hatch far into
the glorious night, Hank and Buddy rolling cigarettes
with my tobacco, and leaves from my pocket-book, while
I enjoyed my dear old briar, as we listened to Boldini's
wonderful tales of the Legion....</p>

<p>The moon rose and flooded the sea with silver
light....</p>

<p>By this time to-morrow, I might be with Michael and
Digby.... I began to nod, fell asleep, woke cold and stiff,
and retired to a very unpleasant hole in the fo'c'sle,
where there were tiers of bunks and many sorrows.</p>

<p>I slept for about ten hours and woke feeling as fit
as a fiddle and ready for anything&mdash;particularly
breakfast.</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">According to Boldini, this should be
provided at eleven o'clock, and should consist of stew and
bread. At ten-thirty, by his advice, we appointed Hank as
spokesman and sergeant, with Boldini as interpreter, "fell
in" in front of the galley, and awaited events like a squad
on parade.</p>

<p>"Eats at eleven, hot and plentiful, Slushy," said Hank,
as the cook came to the galley-door in obvious surprise at
the orderly disciplined assembly.</p>

<p>The cook snarled and swore.</p>

<p>"Do he want me to make signs to him?" asked Hank of the
interpreter.</p>

<p>Boldini informed the cook that the draft knew precisely
what its rights were, and that it was going to have them.
If there was delay or shortage, or if anybody suffered any
ill-effects from the food, the big man was going to beat
him to a jelly.</p>

<p>Then, lest the cook should complain, and there be
trouble at Oran, the big man was coming with a few staunch
friends to see that the cook disappeared overboard, during
the night! Oh, yes, we were a desperate gang, old soldiers
who wouldn't be swindled, and the big man was ex-Champion
Heavy Weight of America. Also, if we were well and
plentifully fed, we might refrain from reporting the cook's
robberies and swindles in the proper quarter....</p>

<p>The cook affected immense amusement, but I thought his
laughter a trifle forced, as Hank's grim leathern face
creased and broke into a dental smile that held no love.</p>

<p>"Squad'll parade right here at eleven, <i>pronto,</i> for the
hand-out, Slushy," said Hank. "Be on time&mdash;and stay
healthy.... Squad&mdash;dismiss."</p>

<p>"<i>Rompez!</i>" shouted Boldini, and then made all clear to
the cook.</p>

<p>At eleven, Hank's sergeant-like crisp bawl,
"Recruits&mdash;<i>fall in,</i>" could be heard all over the
ship; Buddy appointed himself bugler and whistled an
obvious dinner-call, and Boldini roared, "<i>Rangez-vous,
légionnaires!</i>"</p>

<p>The way in which the order was obeyed, made it clear to
me that I was about the only recruit who was not an old
soldier. There was nothing to be surprised at in this,
however, since most continental armies are conscript,
and every man is a soldier. Certainly Hank and Buddy had
been in the army. Later I learned that they had together
adorned the ranks of that fine and famous corps, the Texas
Rangers.</p>

<p>Without a word, the cook filled the <i>gamelles</i> with hot
stew, and Hank passed one to each man, together with a
loaf. He then gave the order to dismiss, and we sat us down
and fed in contentment and good-humour.</p>

<p>At eventide the scene was repeated, and again we
ate, and then we sat and smoked and listened to the
Munchausenesque tales of Boldini, who had certainly "seen
life" as he said.</p>

<p>He was boastful and he was proud of escapades that did
him little credit. If he spoke the truth, he was a brave
man and a very dishonest one. He plainly revealed himself
as extremely cunning, tricky, avaricious, and grasping.
And yet, with all his cleverness and greed, here he was,
glad to accept a <i>sou</i> a day again, to keep himself from
starving.</p>

<p>Buddy did not like him.</p>

<p>"A crook," opined he. "Crooked as a snake with the
belly-ache...."</p>

<p>Early on the third day we sighted the African coast.</p>

<p>After breakfast&mdash;<i>soupe</i> and bread
again&mdash;Buddy requested Boldini to ask the cook to step
outside.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked the cook contemptuously.</p>

<p>Buddy requested that the man should be informed that
he was a coyote, a skunk, a low-lifer, a way down ornery
bindle-stiff, a plate-licking dime-pinching hobo, a
dodgasted greaser, a gol-durned sneak-thief, and a
gosh-dinged slush-slinging poke-out-pinching piker."</p>

<p>Boldini merely said:</p>

<p>"The little man calls you a mean lying thief and a
cowardly mangy cur.... He spits on you and he wants to
fight you. He is a <i>very</i> little man, <i>chef.</i>"</p>

<p>He was, and the cook rushed out to his doom. I fancy
myself as an amateur boxer. Buddy was no amateur and the
cook was no boxer. I thought of a fat sluggish snake and an
angry mongoose, of which Uncle Hector had once told us.</p>

<p>It was not a fight so much as an execution. Buddy was a
dynamic ferocity, and the thieving scoundrel was very badly
damaged.</p>

<p>When he could, or would, rise no more, Hank dragged the
carcase into the galley, reverently bared his head, and
softly closed the door, as one leaving a death-chamber.</p>

<p>"He's restin'. Hush!" he murmured.</p>

<p>Hank and Buddy never held official rank in the
muster-roll of the Legion, but they held high rank in
the hearts of the <i>légionnaires</i> who knew them. That
recruit-squad would certainly have followed them anywhere,
and have obeyed them blindly.</p>

<p>Sandstone cliffs appeared, opened out to a tiny harbour,
and we approached a pier.</p>

<p>We were at Oran, and the Corporal, who was supposed
to be in charge of us made his first appearance on our
fore-deck, formed us up, and handed the squad over to a
Sergeant, who came on board for the purpose.</p>

<p>The Sergeant called the roll of our names, ascertained
that we could "form fours," "form two deep," and turn left
and right correctly, and then marched us ashore.</p>

<p>"I am in Africa!" said I to myself, as we tramped
through the wide clean streets of the European-looking
little town.</p>

<p>Down a street of flat-roofed houses we marched, and
across the broad <i>place,</i> stared at by half-naked negroes,
burnous-clad Arabs, French soldiers, ordinary European
civilians, and promenading ladies and officers.</p>

<p>On through more wide streets to narrow slums and alleys
we went, till at length the town was behind us and the
desert in front.</p>

<p>For an hour or more we marched by a fine road across
the desert, up the sandstone hills on to the cliff-top,
until we came in sight of an old and ugly building, another
obsolete Fort St. Jean, which Boldini said was Fort St.
Thérèse and our present destination.</p>

<p>Into the courtyard of this barrack-hostelry we marched,
and here the roll of our names was again called, this time
by a <i>sous-officier.</i> All were present and correct, the
goods were delivered, and we were directed to break off and
follow our Sergeant to a barrack-room.</p>

<p>As I went in behind him, with Boldini and the German,
Glock, behind me, a well-known voice remarked:</p>

<p>"Enter the Third Robber." <i>It was Digby's.</i></p>

<p>Michael and Digby were sitting side by side on a bench,
their hands in their pockets, their pipes in their mouths,
and consternation upon their faces!</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Michael. "You unutterable young
fool! God help us!..."</p>

<p>I fell upon them. While I shook Michael's hand, Digby
shook my other one, and while I shook Digby's hand, Michael
shook my head. They then threw me upon the common "bed"
(about twenty feet long and six broad) and shook my feet,
finally pulling me on to the ground. I arose and closed
with Digby, and Michael pushed us both over. We rose
and both closed with Michael, until all three fell in a
heap.</p>

<p>We then felt better, and realised that we were objects
of interest and concern, alike to our acquaintances and to
the strangers within our gates.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Buddy. "Fightin' already! Beat 'em up,
Bo."</p>

<p>"Dorg-fight," observed Hank. "Chew their ears, son."</p>

<p>"Mad English," shrugged Vogué, the French embezzler.
"They fight when civilised people embrace."</p>

<p>Boldini was deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Third <i>robber!</i>" he said on a note of mingled comment
and enquiry to Glock.</p>

<p>"Beau and Dig," said I, "let me introduce two
shore-enough blowed-in-the-glass, dyed-in-the-wool,
whole-piece White Men from God's Own Country&mdash;Hank and
Buddy.... My brothers, Michael and Digby."</p>

<p>They laughed and held out their hands.</p>

<p>"Americans possibly," said Digby.</p>

<p>"Shake," said Hank and Buddy as one man, and the four
shook gravely.</p>

<p>"Mr. Francesco Boldini," said I. "My brothers," and
neither Michael nor Digby offered his hand to the Italian,
until that gentleman reached for it effusively.</p>

<p>"I think wine is indicated, gentlemen," he said, and
eyeing us in turn, added, "'<i>when we three robbers meet
again,</i>' so to speak." Michael invited Hank and Buddy to
join us, and Boldini led the way and did the honours of
Fort St. Thérèse.</p>

<p>In this canteen the wine was as good as, and even
cheaper than, the wine at Fort St. Jean&mdash;cheaper than
ordinary draught-beer in England.</p>

<p>We three sat, drinking little, and watching the others
drink a good deal, for which Michael insisted on paying.</p>

<p>We were soon joined by some old <i>légionnaires,</i> who
appeared to be stationed permanently at the place, and,
from them and Boldini, heard innumerable lurid stories of
the Legion, for the truth of all of which they vouched,
with earnest protestations and strange oaths. I noticed
that the earnestness and strangeness of the latter were in
inverse proportion to the probability of the former.</p>

<p>"I perceive we are not about to enter '<i>an academy for
the sons of gentlemen where religious and moral training,
character-forming and development of the intelligence, are
placed before examination-cramming,</i>' my son," observed
Digby to me, quoting from the syllabus of our preparatory
school, as we left the canteen.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "but it sounds an uncommonly good school
for mercenary soldiers" (and we found that it was certainly
that).</p>

<p>"One hopes that this is not a fair sample of our future
home-life and domestic surroundings," remarked Michael as
we entered the barrack-room.</p>

<p>It was an utterly beastly place, dark, dirty, and
depressing, its sole furniture being the great wooden
guard-bed before mentioned (which was simply a huge shelf,
innocent of mattress or covering, on which a score or so of
men could lie side by side), a heap of evil-looking brown
blankets in a corner, and a couple of benches. The place
would have disgraced a prison if used as a common cell.</p>

<p>However, Boldini assured us that things would be quite
different at the depôt at Saida or Sidi-bel-Abbès&mdash;and
I assumed that to be different they must be better, for
they couldn't be worse.</p>

<p>Our evening meal was the now familiar <i>soupe</i> and
bread, and Boldini told us that the unvarying African
daily ration was half a pound of meat and three <i>sous</i>
worth of vegetables served as stew, a pound and a half
of bread, half an ounce of coffee, and half an ounce of
sugar. He said it was nourishing and sufficient but deadly
monotonous, and, as to the latter, I was prepared to
believe him. The prospect of two meals a day, and those
eternally and undeviatingly similar, seemed unexhilarating
and I said so.</p>

<p>"One gets used to it," said Boldini, "just as one
gets used to 'eternally' washing with soap and water. If
you are content to wash daily with soap and water you
can be content to feed daily on <i>soupe</i> and bread.... Or
do you occasionally wash with champagne and a slice of
cake&mdash;or hot tea and a lump of coal&mdash;as a change
from the 'eternal' water and soap?..."</p>

<p>"Of course," he added impudently, "if you are going to
come the fine gentleman and swell mobsman..."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Boldini," said I, with a cold stare.
"Or at any rate, try not to be an ass."</p>

<p>He eyed me speculatively and complied. Master Boldini
struck me as a gentleman who would need keeping in his
place. Whatever that might be, it was not going to be
one of the offensive familiarity that breeds contempt.
I was not quite certain, but I was under the impression
that "swell mobsman" was a thieves'-kitchen term for a
well-dressed and "gentlemanly" swindler, burglar, and
general criminal, in a superior way of business.</p>

<p>After <i>soupe,</i> there was nothing to do but to return to
the canteen, as we were not allowed to leave the Fort. We
spent the evening there, and I was glad to see that Beau
and Digby seemed to like Hank and Buddy as much as I did,
and that the two Americans, so far as one could judge of
the feelings of such taciturn people, reciprocated.</p>

<p>Digby constituted himself host, and everybody was quite
happy and well-behaved.</p>

<p>With one or two exceptions, none of the recruits,
whether of my own draft, or of that with which my brothers
had come, struck me as interesting.</p>

<p>They were just a fairly representative collection of
very poor men from France, Belgium, Germany (chiefly Alsace
and Lorraine), Spain, Austria, and Switzerland.</p>

<p>They looked like labourers, artisans, soldiers in mufti,
newspaper-sellers, shop-boys, clerks, and the usual sort
of men of all ages whom one would see in the poorer streets
of any town, or in a Rowton House.</p>

<p>They certainly did not look like rogues and
criminals.</p>

<p>Two or three, out of the couple of dozen or so, were
well-dressed and well-spoken, and one of them, I felt sure,
was an ex-officer of the French or Belgian army.</p>

<p>At any rate, he had "soldier" stamped all over him,
was well-dressed, smart, dapper, and <i>soigné;</i> was
well-educated and had charming manners. He called himself
Jean St. André, but I suspected a third name, with a <i>de</i>
in front of it. He had rather attached himself to us three,
and we all liked him.</p>

<p>It struck me that community of habits, tastes, customs,
and outlook form a stronger bond of sympathy than
community of race; and that men of the same social caste
and different nationality were much more attracted to
each other than men of the same nationality and different
caste....</p>

<p>When the canteen closed, Beau proposed that we should
shorten the night as much as possible, and spend the
minimum of time in that loathsome cell, lying packed like
sardines on the bare boards of the guard-bed shelf, with a
score of men and a million insects.</p>

<p>Digby observed that the sandy ground of the courtyard
would be no harder and much cleaner; and the air, if
colder, infinitely preferable to the fug of the Black Hole
of St. Thérèse.</p>

<p>We selected an eligible corner, seated ourselves in a
row propped against the wall, still warm from the day's
sunshine, and prepared for a night under the wonderful
African stars.</p>

<p>"Well, my poor, dear, idiotic, mad pup&mdash;and what
the devil do you think you're doing here?" began Michael,
as soon as we were settled and our pipes alight.</p>

<p>"Fleeing from justice, Beau," said I. "What are you?"</p>

<p>"Same thing," replied Michael.</p>

<p>"And you, Dig?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Who, me?" answered Digby. "Well, to tell you the
truth, I, personally, am, as it were, what you might
call&mdash;er&mdash;fleeing from justice....</p>

<p>"<i>Three</i> fleas," he observed, breaking a long
silence.</p>

<p>"Did you bring the 'Blue Water' with you, John?" asked
Digby.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "No, I didn't bring it with me."</p>

<p>"Careless," remarked Digby.</p>

<p>"Did you bring it, Beau?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Michael.</p>

<p>"Careful," commented Digby.</p>

<p>"Did you bring it with you too, Dig?" I enquired.</p>

<p>"Never travel without it," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I suppose one of us three has got it," I said
wearily.</p>

<p>"Two of us," corrected Digby.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it's here all right," said Michael. "What
would be the good of our being here if it were not?</p>

<p>"Bring us up to date about things," he added. "How's
everybody bearing up?"</p>

<p>I told them the details of my evasion; of how I had
declined an interview with Aunt Patricia; of how the shock
of somebody's disgraceful behaviour had been too much for
the Chaplain's health; of the respective attitudes of
Augustus, Claudia, and Isobel.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> rough on Claudia," said Michael, "and, in a
different way, on the poor old Chaplain."</p>

<p>"And in a different way, again, on Aunt Patricia," I
observed.</p>

<p>"Thirty thousand pounds," mused Digby. "What price dear
Uncle Hector, when she breaks it to him! He'll go mad and
bite her."</p>

<p>"Doesn't bear thinking of," said I.</p>

<p>"Deuced lucky for young Gussie that Isobel was able to
clear him," mused Digby.</p>

<p>"That's what makes it so hard on Claudia&mdash;or would
have done, if we hadn't bolted," said Michael. "Gussie
and Isobel being out of it&mdash;it was she or one of
us...."</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, I was aware of a sound,
close beside us, where a buttress of the wall projected.
Probably a rat or some nocturnal bird; possibly a dog.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it <i>was</i> one of us," said Michael, "and
we have demonstrated the fact. We've overdone it a bit,
though.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you have enjoyed your ill-gotten gains in
peace, at home, John?" he went on. "Or left me to enjoy
mine abroad? Why this wholesale emigration?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Digby, "absolute mob. They won't be able
to decide whether we were all in the job together, or
whether we're chasing each other to get a share of the
loot."</p>

<p>"No," said Michael. "Problem'll worry them like
anything."</p>

<p>"When are we to let them know we're in the Legion,
Beau?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We're not there yet," was the reply.</p>

<p>"When we are," I pursued.</p>

<p>"Dunno.... Think about it," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Don't see why we should let 'em know we're all there
together," said Digby. "Better if one was at, or up, the
North Pole, the other up the South Pole, and the third
sitting on the Equator. More mystery about it&mdash;and
they wouldn't know which to chase first."</p>

<p>"Something in that," agreed Michael. "If we are all
together (since you two have come), we are obviously all
implicated&mdash;all three thieves. If we are scattered,
two of us must be innocent. There is a doubt on each of us,
but not a stain on any particular one of us.... Why write
at all, in fact? We are just runaway criminals. They don't
write home...."</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> strength is as the strength of ten, because my
heart is puah," bleated Digby.</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> strength will be as the strength of eleven if you
don't shut up," warned Michael.</p>

<p>"I don't see the point really, Beau," I objected. "We
prove nothing at all by being scattered. We might still all
be criminals. We could easily have planned to pinch the
sapphire, to bolt in different directions, and to share
the loot by meeting later on.... Or we could share without
meeting. One of us could dispose of it in Amsterdam or
somewhere, bank the money, and send a third of it to each
of the others by draft or cheque, or something...."</p>

<p>"Hark at the young criminal!" said Digby.... "Hasn't he
got a mind?"...</p>

<p>"What I mean is," I explained, "it's a bit rough
on&mdash;er&mdash;those that are left at home, not to
let them know where we are&mdash;alive or dead and all
that...."</p>

<p>"Thinking of Gussie?" asked Digby.</p>

<p>"Besides," I went on, "how are they to let us know if
the damned thing turns up?... And how are we to know how
they are getting on?..."</p>

<p>"True," agreed Michael. "We ought to let Aunt Patricia
know that we are hale and hearty, and she ought to be in
a position to let us know if anything happens or turns
up. What we <i>don't</i> want to do meanwhile, is to spoil the
impression that one of us is the thief.... I still think
it would help to keep suspicion on us, and to deepen the
mystery, if we don't let it be known that we are all
together.... We don't want some fool saying that we three
agreed to take the blame and share it, and so cleared out
together to the same place... while the thief is still at
Brandon Abbas...."</p>

<p>"Who <i>did</i> pinch the filthy thing?" said Digby, voicing
once more the question that I had asked myself a thousand
times.</p>

<p>"I did," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Then why the devil don't you put it back?" asked
Digby.</p>

<p>"Too late now," answered Michael. "Besides, I want to
lie low and then sell it for thirty thousand pounds, five
years hence; invest the money in various sound things, and
have the income (of fifteen hundred to two thousand a year)
for life.... Live like Uncle Hector&mdash;sport, hunting,
travel, big-game shooting, flat in town, clubs...."</p>

<p>"On Uncle Hector's money?" I said.</p>

<p>"Doubles the joy of it, what?" replied Michael.</p>

<p>"Funny thing that," put in Digby. "It's just what
I'm going to do&mdash;except that I find one can't get
more than about twenty thousand, and I'm going to put it
into a South Sea Island plantation and an Island trading
concern.... Have the best schooner in the Islands, and
be my own supercargo.... Every third year, come home and
live the gay life on my twenty-per-cent profits. I reckon
to make about four thousand a year. Yes.... Marquesas,
Apia, Honolulu, Tahiti, Papeete, Kanakas, copra, ukaleles,
lava-lavas, surf-riding, Robert Louis Stevenson...."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the 'Blue Water'
meanwhile?" I asked, humouring the humorists.</p>

<p>"Always carry it about with me," said Digby. "If I get
an eye knocked out I shall wear it in the empty socket....
Blue-eyed boy.... Good idea, that...."</p>

<p>"Or you might put it where the monkey put the
nuts&mdash;develop a pouch in your cheek. Very simple for
you, I should think," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Both rotten ideas," objected Michael. "Marsupial is the
tip. Kangaroo's custom. They carry about their young and
their money and things in a sort of bag, you know... in
front... accessible. I keep it on me, night and day&mdash;
wash-leather pouch in a money-belt. I thought it all
out beforehand, and bought the thing in London.... Got
to kill the man before you can rob him. Hatton Garden
diamond-merchants wear them when they travel. Round their
little tummies under their little vests...."</p>

<p>"What makes them all look so paunchy," corroborated
Digby.</p>

<p>"You haven't told us what <i>you</i> are going to do, John,"
he went on. "Are you going to lie low for the five years
and then sell it?... What are you going to do with the
money?"</p>

<p>"Divide it with you and Beau," I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, stout fella," approved Digby. "He puts us to shame,
Beau, doesn't he? Let's put him to death in return, and
keep his share."</p>

<p>"Quite," agreed Michael. "We've got to find out what
he's done with it first, though...."</p>

<p>And so we ragged and chatted, sitting there, three of
the most incredibly foolish young fools in their folly,
but perfectly care-free and leaving to the morrow what the
morrow might bring forth....</p>

<p>Towards morning we dozed, and the dawn found us cold,
stiff, and aching, but quite happy. We were together; life,
the world, and adventure were before us.</p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p class="first">A third draft of recruits arrived
after morning <i>soupe,</i> and we learnt that all were to
be evacuated that day, one half going to Saida, the
depôt of the Second Regiment of the Foreign Legion, and
the remainder to Sidi-bel-Abbès, the depôt of the First
Regiment.</p>

<p>The question that at once agitated our breasts was as to
whether we could keep together.</p>

<p>We rather preferred the idea of the First Regiment to
that of the Second, simply because it was the First; but
we did not much care either way, provided we were not
separated. To that we simply would not agree.</p>

<p>I was distinctly pleased to find that the two Americans
wished to come with us.</p>

<p>They had no more intention of parting from each other
than we three had, but provided that they could keep
together they wanted to go where we went.</p>

<p>To us came Boldini as we strolled round the
courtyard.</p>

<p>"Let's stick together, we four," quoth he. "I'm going
to the First, and you'd better come too. I know all the
ropes there, and can put you up to everything. Get you in
right with the corporals.... Sergeant Lejaune's a friend of
mine...."</p>

<p>"We three are certainly going together," said Michael,
"and we want the two Americans to come with us, and we
prefer the First, on the whole. Have we any say in the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Ten francs would have a say," replied Boldini. "They'd
talk louder than six men. Put up the ten francs, and I can
work it that we six go to the First.... But why bother
about the Americans? They are uncultivated people."</p>

<p>"We're going to cultivate them," punned Michael.</p>

<p>We produced the ten francs and Boldini departed to
"arrange" the matter, as he said.</p>

<p>Whether we owed anything to his efforts or not, I never
knew. He may have "squared" a corporal, or he may merely
have notified our wish to go together to the <i>Premier
Étranger.</i> Or, again, it may merely have been by chance
that we found ourselves in the half detailed for Sidi-bel-
Abbès.</p>

<p>As we "fell in" to march to the station, I and St.
André stood behind Michael and Digby, while Boldini and
an English-speaking Swiss, named Maris, stood behind Hank
and Buddy, who were next to Michael and Digby. Thus, when
we "formed fours," my brothers and I and St. André made
one "four," and Hank, Buddy, Boldini, and Maris the "four"
behind us.</p>

<p>This Maris seemed an excellent person. He had been a
travelling valet and courier, and had all the experience,
address, linguistic knowledge, and general ability to be
expected of a person who could earn his living in that
capacity. He attached himself to us because he liked
the English, and was, as he naïvely observed, "fond of
gentlemen." He was a smiling, pleasant fellow of agreeable
manners and attractive appearance.</p>

<p>At Oran station we entrained in about the poorest and
slowest conveyance ever drawn by steam. This specimen of
the West Algerian Railway Company's rolling-stock made its
way from Oran to Sidi-bel-Abbès at an average rate of ten
miles an hour, and in spite of the novelty of the scenery
and of the population of the wayside stations, we grew very
weary of it.</p>

<p>Our two "fours" and a couple of Germans filled one
compartment, and we whiled away the time by questioning
Boldini concerning life in the Legion, and by listening to
his innumerable stories.</p>

<p>It seemed somewhat dream-like to me, to be sitting in
a tiny bare third-class railway-carriage, somnolently
rolling across Africa in company with my brothers, two
Americans, an ex-officer of a continental army, an
Anglo-Indian Italian, a Swiss courier, and a pair of German
workmen, listening to tales of a life as far removed from
that of Europe as are the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>Watching the slowly-passing scenery of the country-side,
I was surprised at its difference from what one might have
expected in Africa, it being neither of desert nor jungle,
but a cultivated country of fields, farms, orchards,
and gardens. It was not until we were approaching our
destination that sand-hills and desert encroached and a
note of wildness and savagery prevailed.</p>

<p>Negro and Arab boys and men brought fruit to our window
at every station, and very fine grapes, oranges, melons,
and figs could be bought extremely cheaply.</p>

<p>"This is all right," remarked Digby, who was always
very fond of fruit, "if one can get fruit at this price in
Sidi-bel-Abbès."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Boldini drily, "if you devote your entire
income entirely to fruit, you'll be able to get a little
every day of your life."</p>

<p>A halfpenny a day for fruit does not sound much, but the
devotion of one's total income to it seems excessive.</p>

<p>"No income tax?" asked Digby, and we were relieved, if
surprised, to hear that there was none.</p>

<p>We reached Sidi-bel-Abbès Station in the evening, and
were received by a sergeant and corporals, were lined
up and marched off, in fours, along a broad road. At
the station gate I noticed a picket of non-commissioned
officers, who sharply scrutinised all who passed it.</p>

<p>As we marched along, I got a somewhat Spanish impression
of the town, probably because I heard the tinkling of a
guitar and saw some women with high combs and mantillas,
among the nondescript Europeans who were strolling between
the yellow houses. Entering the town itself, through a
great gate in the huge ramparts, we were in a curiously
hybrid Oriental-European atmosphere in which moved stately
Arabs, smart French ladies, omnibuses, camels, half-naked
negroes, dapper officers, crowds of poor Jewish-looking
working-folk, soldiers by the hundred, negroes, grisettes,
black newspaper boys selling the <i>Écho d'Oran,</i> pig-tailed
European girls, Spaniards, Frenchmen, Algerian Jews,
Levantines, men and women straight from the Bible, and
others straight from the Boulevards, Arab policemen,
Spahis, Turcos, Zouaves, and Chasseurs d'Afrique.</p>

<p>No less hybrid was the architecture, and the eye passed
from white gleaming mosque with glorious minaret to gaudy
café with garish lights; from showy shops to shuttered
Oriental houses; from carved balconies and coloured tiles
to municipal clock-towers and enamel advertisements; from
Moorish domes and arches to French newspaper kiosks and
lamp-posts; from Eastern bazaars to Western hotels and
clubs and Government offices and secretariats.</p>

<p>And almost everywhere were beautiful avenues of palms
and groves of olives, ably seconding the efforts of Moorish
mosque and Arab architecture in the unequal struggle
between artistic Oriental romance and vulgar Occidental
utilitarianism. Hybridism insisted through other senses
too, for the ear saught now the "<i>Allah Akbar! Lah illah
il Allah! Ya Saidna Mohammed rais ul Allah!</i>"of the
muezzin on the minaret; the shouting of an angry Spanish
woman; the warning cries in <i>sabir</i> of a negro driver;
snatches of French conversation from passing soldiers; the
loud wrangling in Arabic of a police <i>goumier</i> and some
camelmen; and a strange haunting chorus from behind a wall,
of:</p>

<blockquote> <blockquote> "<i>Travaja la muqueir<br> Travaja
bono<br> Bono bezef la muqueir<br> Travaja bono.</i>"
</blockquote> </blockquote>

<p>And to the nostrils were wafted scents of Eastern food
and Western drink, camel-dung fires and Parisian patchouli;
Eastern spices and Western cooking; now the odour of
unwashen Eastern men, now of perfumed Western women.</p>

<p>"Kind of 'Algeria at Olympia,' this," observed Digby.
"Good spot. Reminds one of Widdicombe."</p>

<p>Turning from a main thoroughfare we entered a lane that
ran between the barracks of the Spahi cavalry and those of
the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>Through the railings of great iron gates we could see a
colossal three-story yellow building, at the far side of a
vast expanse of parade ground.</p>

<p>"Our College," remarked Digby.</p>

<p>On either side of the gates were guard-house and
prison.</p>

<p>A small door was opened beside the gates, and we filed
through.</p>

<p>The guard, seated on a long bench outside the
guard-house, observed us without enthusiasm. The Sergeant
of the Guard emerged and looked us over, and then closed
his eyes, while he slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>A knot of men, clad in white uniform with wide blue
sashes round their waists, gathered and regarded us.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" said one, "there's that blackguard Boldini
back again. As big a fool as he is a knave, evidently!"</p>

<p>Boldini affected deafness.</p>

<p>And then appeared upon the scene the only man I have
ever met who seemed to me to be bad, wholly bad, evil all
through, without a single redeeming virtue save courage.</p>

<p>He came from the regimental offices, a fierce-looking,
thick-set, dark man, with the face and figure of a
prize-fighter; glaring and staring of eye, swarthily
handsome, with the neck and jowl of a bull-dog. He also had
the curious teeth-baring, chin-protruding jaw-thrust of a
bull-dog, and there were two deep lines between the heavy
beetling brows.</p>

<p>A digression: This was Colour-Sergeant Lejaune, a
terrible and terrifying man, who had made his way in the
Legion (and who made it further still) by distinguishing
himself among distinguished martinets as a relentlessly
harsh and meticulous disciplinarian, a savagely violent
taskmaster, and a punishing non-com. of tremendous energy,
ability, and courage.</p>

<p>To his admiring superiors he was invaluable; to his
despairing subordinates he was unspeakable. He was a
reincarnation and lineal descendant of the overseers who
lashed the dying galley-slaves of the Roman triremes, and
as different from the officers as were the overseers from
the Roman centurions.</p>

<p>He would have made a splendid wild-beast tamer, for he
had all the courage, strength, forceful personality, hardy
overbearing consciousness of superiority, and contemptuous,
callous brutality required in that bold, ignoble
profession. And it pleased him to regard himself as one,
and to treat his legionaries as wild beasts; as dangerous,
evil, savage, criminal brutes, instead of as what they
were&mdash;fairly representative specimens of the average
population of the countries from which they came.</p>

<p>Nor should it be supposed that Colour-Sergeant Lejaune
was himself a typical representative specimen of his class,
the Legion non-com. Though these men are usually harsh and
somewhat tyrannical martinets, they are not villainous
brutes.</p>

<p>Lejaune was. He took an actual delight in punishing, and
nothing angered him more than to be unable to find a reason
for doing it.</p>

<p>Probably he began by punishing (to the fullest extent of
his powers and opportunity), in order to secure the most
perfect discipline and to display his zeal, efficiency, and
worth as a strong non-com.; and, from that, came to punish
as a habit, until the habit became a taste, and then a lust
and an obsession.</p>

<p>And later, through the coming to the Legion of a
deserter from the Belgian army, we learnt a sinister,
significant, and explanatory fact.</p>

<p>Lejaune had been dismissed from the Belgian Congo
service for brutalities and atrocities exceeding even the
limit fixed by good King Leopold's merry men.</p>

<p>There had been an exposure engineered by foreign
missionaries, a world-wide scandal, and some
white-washing&mdash;in the course of which Lejaune had been
washed out.</p>

<p>From being a sergeant of the Belgian army, and a
Congo rubber-station factor, autocratic, well-paid, and
with absolute power, he had become a legionary, and by
forcefulness, energy, and courage had made good.</p>

<p>Once more he had scope for the brutality, violence, and
ferocious arrogance that had been his assets in the Belgian
Congo, of terrible memory.</p>

<p>At times he was undoubtedly mad, and his madness took
the form of sadistic savagery.</p>

<p>Upon this man, Boldini certainly had some claim, or
between them there was some bond, for Lejaune never
punished Boldini, and they were at times seen in private
confabulation, though, of course, no non-commissioned
officer ever walked out, nor drank, with a private
soldier.</p>

<p>The Belgian deserter, one Vaerren, declared that Boldini
had been a civilian subordinate in the Congo, and in
Lejaune's district, and had been imprisoned for peculation
and falsifying his trade returns. Of the truth of this I
know nothing, but I do know that Lejaune favoured the man
and procured his promotion to Corporal, when he himself
became Sergeant-Major.</p>

<p>And it was into the hands of this Lejaune that we were
now delivered.</p>

<p>To resume: Colour-Sergeant Lejaune called the roll of
our names and looked us over.</p>

<p>Noting the insignificant stature of Buddy, a pocket
Hercules, his face set in a contemptuous sneer.</p>

<p>"An undersized cur," he remarked to the Sergeant of the
Guard.</p>

<p>"Guess I've seen better things than you dead on a sticky
fly-paper, anyhow," replied Buddy promptly.</p>

<p>Mercifully Lejaune knew no English&mdash;but he knew
that a wretched recruit had dared to open his miserable
mouth.</p>

<p>"Silence, dog!" he roared. "Open your foul lips again,
and I'll close them for a month with my boot.... Speak
again, you hound, and I'll kick your teeth down your
throat."</p>

<p>Buddy had not understood a word. He had seen a sneer,
and heard contemptuous words; and he had dared to presume
upon being an ignorant recruit, not even in uniform. Now
he heard an angry roar, and was too old a soldier to do
anything but stiffen to attention.</p>

<p>It was borne in upon him that there was <i>some</i> pep to
Legion sergeants, and they were <i>some</i> roosters, on their
own dung-hill. Better argue with a New York cop on Broadway
at midnight, than to donate back-chat to the rough-neck.</p>

<p>But the mischief was done, and Buddy was a marked man.
More, any friend of Buddy was a marked man, and any friend
of his friend's, unto the third and fourth generation.</p>

<p>When the bloodshot eye of Colour-Sergeant Lejaune fell
upon Boldini, it halted, and a long look passed between the
two men. Neither spoke.</p>

<p>Upon us three Gestes he looked with disfavour.</p>

<p>"Runaway pimps," he said. "Show me your hands."</p>

<p>We held them out.</p>

<p>"Going to tell our fortunes.... Beware of a dark ugly
man," whispered Digby to me.</p>

<p>The Colour-Sergeant regarded our decently kept hands and
snorted:</p>

<p>"I'll harden those for you, by God.... Never done a
stroke of work in your lives.... I'll manicure you before
you die.... I'll make you wish you had gone to gaol
instead."</p>

<p>He looked Hank over.</p>

<p>"A lazy hulk, I'll take my oath," he observed. "I'll
teach you to move quickly, in a way that'll surprise you,"
he promised.</p>

<p>"Shore, Bo," replied Hank mildly, wishing to be polite,
though ignorant of what had been said to him. "Spill
another mouthful," he added encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Silence, you chattering ape from the trees!" roared
Lejaune. "Speak again and I'll tie your wrists to your
ankles in the small of your back for a week. By God, I'll
cripple you for life, you two-legged talking camel."</p>

<p>And Hank also grasped that silence is frequently more
than gold and speech much less than silver.</p>

<p>Having duly impressed the draft, Colour-Sergeant Lejaune
announced that the Seventh Company would be afflicted
with the lot of us, and serve it right. He then suddenly
roared:</p>

<p>"<i>Garde à vous! Pour défiler! Par files de quatre, à
droit,</i>" and looked eagerly and anxiously for a victim. His
face clouded with chagrin and disappointment. The draft
had moved like guardsmen. Those who understood French had
sprung to attention and turned like machines, and those who
did not understand the actual words had moved with them.</p>

<p>"<i>En avant.... Marche!</i>" he concluded, and we stepped
off like the old soldiers most of us were.</p>

<p>Across the drill-ground we marched to the storeroom
of the <i>fourrier-sergent</i> of the Seventh Company,
and received our kit which, in addition to two cloth
uniforms, included white fatigue uniforms, linen spats,
underclothing, the blue woollen sash or cummerbund,
cleaning materials, soap and towels, but no socks, for the
Legion does not wear them.</p>

<p>We were then inspected by the <i>adjudant-major,</i> who
corresponds to the English adjutant (whereas the <i>adjudant</i>
is a non-commissioned officer), and marched by a corporal
to our <i>casernes,</i> or barrack-rooms.</p>

<p>Going up staircases and along corridors, a squad of ten
of us, including Boldini, St. André, Vogué, Maris, Glock,
Buddy, Hank, my brothers, and myself, were directed to our
room&mdash;a huge, clean, well-ventilated bare chamber,
in which were thirty beds. Here we were handed over to
some <i>légionnaires,</i> who were polishing their belts,
cartridge-pouches, and accoutrements.</p>

<p>"<i>Bleus,</i>" said Corporal Dupré to these men. "Show
them what to do, Schwartz, Colonna, Brandt, Haff, and
Delarey.... Kit, bedding, <i>paquetage, astiquage,</i>
everything. Don't go <i>en</i> <i>promenade</i> before they know
their boots from their <i>képis.</i>"</p>

<p>"All right, Corporal," said one of the men, and when the
Corporal had gone out, changed his tone as he went on:</p>

<p>"The devil damn all <i>bleus.</i> Why couldn't you go to
hell, instead of coming here to waste our time?... However,
you shall repay us in the canteen. Come on, get to work
now, and the sooner we can get to the bottles..."</p>

<p>But Boldini had a word to say.</p>

<p>"Wriggle back into the cheese you crawled out of, you
one-year, half-baked imitation of a soldier," he snapped.
"I was a legionary and fought in Madagascar, Morocco, and
the Soudan when you were in the foundling orphanage."</p>

<p>"Name of a name of a name of a name!" gabbled one of the
men, "if it isn't old Boldini come back!" and he roared
with laughter and threw himself on a bed.</p>

<p>"Wait till I'm a corporal, friend Brandt," said Boldini.
"I'll make you laugh louder than that."</p>

<p>He did not have to wait, however, as the man redoubled
his yells of laughter.</p>

<p>The return of Boldini, for some reason, struck him as a
most priceless joke.</p>

<p>"Here, you Colonna, Schwartz, and Haff, take those five
and I'll attend to these," said Boldini; and proceeded to
direct us to appropriate beds and put our kit on them.</p>

<p>He then gave us a clever exhibition of clothes-folding,
and built up a secure and neat little <i>paquetage</i> of
uniform and kit on the shelf above his bed.</p>

<p>"There you are&mdash;do that first," said he.
"Everything in elbow-to-finger-tip lengths, piled so,"
and we set about folding coats, trousers, overcoats, and
kit, as he had done, and putting the pile on the shelf at
the head of the bed as there was no kit-bag or box of any
sort.</p>

<p>Having done this, we had our first lesson in
<i>astiquage,</i> the polishing of belts, and cartridge-pouches,
with wax and rags; and then in rifle-cleaning.</p>

<p>We were next conducted downstairs and out to the
concrete open-air <i>lavabo,</i> and shown where to wash our
white canvas fatigue-uniforms. We were then hurried to the
canteen, that we might do our duty to our comrades of the
<i>escouade</i> and pay our footing.</p>

<p>The scene here resembled that in the canteens of Forts
St. Jean and St. Thérèse, save that the men were all
<i>légionnaires,</i> of course, and the person behind the bar
was a woman&mdash;a veritable French <i>vivandière</i> and
<i>fille du regiment.</i></p>

<p>Here again, a few francs procured an incredible quantity
of wine and all was harmony, noise, and hectic gaiety of
the kind induced by alcohol. Returning to our barrack-room
at the call of the "Lights out" bugle, we completed our
preparations for the morrow by the meagre light of the
<i>caserne</i> night-lamp.</p>

<p>We gathered that we should be aroused by the
<i>garde-chambre</i> at five-fifteen in the morning, and should
have to be on recruit-parade at five-thirty in white
uniform and sash, with knapsack, rifle, belts, and bayonet,
and that everything must be immaculate and shining. Also
that, before quitting the room, the blankets and mattresses
of the bed must be folded and piled, and arranged to a
hairbreadth accuracy, and the floor beneath the bed swept
clean.</p>

<p>Apparently this cleanliness need not extend to the
person, for there were no washing facilities of any sort in
the room, nor on the whole of that floor of the barracks,
nor on the one below. An eccentric, in search of a morning
wash, had to make his way down four flights of stairs to a
rude and crude kind of lavatory on the ground-floor.</p>

<p>As the <i>garde-chambre</i> saw no reason to arouse himself
more than a quarter of an hour before he was himself due
for parade, and then had to fetch the coffee-pail before
arousing the others, this was apt to be a crowded quarter
of an hour of inglorious life.</p>

<p>So, with the conscientious fears of the ignorant novice,
at least one recruit endeavoured to have everything right
and ready before he went to bed, and secretly determined to
wake himself at half-past four next morning, to make a good
beginning.</p>

<p>Michael's bed was in the corner by the huge window,
Boldini's was next, Digby's next, and then that of
an Italian calling himself Colonna. Mine came next,
then Brandt's, then Buddy's, then Haff's, and then
Hank's&mdash;always an old <i>légionnaire</i> next to a recruit,
and so on throughout the room.</p>

<p>In the corner by the door, was the bed of Corporal
Dupré, who was in command of the <i>escouade</i> and in charge
of the room.</p>

<p>He was an active, noisy, bustling person, humorous and
not unkindly when sober; when overfull of canteen wine he
was sullen, suspicious, and dangerous. Being very fond of
wine he was easily approachable by anyone who chose to
provide it&mdash;or rather the means of purchasing it.</p>

<p>While we three and the Americans were gathered in a
group, putting the last touches to our kit and extracting
information and advice from Boldini, he came into the room,
undressed and went to bed.</p>

<p>As he lay down he bawled:</p>

<p>"Silence! If any man makes a sound, between now and
sunrise, he'll make the next sound in hospital," and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>We got into our beds in a silence that could be felt.</p>

<p>I remained awake, because I was anxious to go to sleep;
and lay thinking of Isobel, of what was happening at
Brandon Abbas, of our strange position, and of the "Blue
Water."</p>

<p>When I thought of what now lay before me, I was
unutterably thankful that my guess, or instinct, had been
right, and that I was with Michael and Digby.</p>

<p>It would have been rather terrible to find myself in
this galley alone. With Beau and Digby here, it would
be just adventure&mdash;hard, rough, and dangerous, no
doubt&mdash;but no easy flowery path leads to any place
worth arriving at.</p>

<p>And what of Michael and Digby? They each still pretended
to be the culprit, which was doubly as absurd an idea as
that either one of them should be.</p>

<p>Michael's look had been one of sheer horror and
consternation when he had caught sight of me at Port St.
Thérèse, and he had seemed to feel that my flight was
a complication and a catastrophe on which he had never
reckoned.</p>

<p>Had he felt the same about Digby, or had Digby known
more than he told me? I must try to find out....</p>

<p>I fell asleep and was awakened, apparently a minute
later, by the <i>garde-chambre</i> shouting something as he lit
a big central lamp that hung from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Men sat up in bed; each took a tin mug from a hook
below the shelf above his head, and held it out to the
<i>garde-chambre,</i> who went round with a great jug, giving
everybody about half a pint of coffee. It was hot, strong,
and good.</p>

<p>The Corporal shouted:</p>

<p>"<i>Levez-vous! Levez-vous!</i>" and then, as on the Eve of
Waterloo, "there was hurrying to and fro&mdash;and sudden
partings," if not "tremblings of distress and cheeks all
pale...."</p>

<p>Michael, Digby, and I rushed to the far-off lavatory,
dashed our heads into water and fled back towelling.</p>

<p>I found my bed "made," my kit laid out neatly, my boots
brushed, everything put ready as by a valet, and Brandt
sweeping under my bed.</p>

<p>I stared in astonishment.</p>

<p>"A couple of <i>sous,</i> comrade!" said Brandt, and I
understood. An income of a halfpenny a day is one that will
stand a good deal of augmenting.</p>

<p>Turning to see if I could do anything for Michael or
Digby, I found that Boldini and Colonna were before me,
each earning in a few minutes, as a valet, what it took
them two days to earn as a soldier.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time, all were dressed and
ready, the <i>garde-chambre</i> had swept up the dust and dirt
that the men had brushed out from under the beds, and
Corporal Dupré had been round to see that the beds were
properly made and everything tidy. Then, following upon
a shout of "<i>Garde à vous,</i>" the Colour-Sergeant of the
Company entered and inspected the room and the men.</p>

<p>All prayed that he might find no fault, for if he did,
he would punish the Corporal, and the Corporal would punish
the offenders tenfold.</p>

<p>In the French army, non-commissioned officers can, like
prefects in our public schools, award punishments without
reference to officers. They give the punishment, enter
it in the <i>livre de punitions,</i> and there is an end of
the matter&mdash;unless the officer, inspecting the book,
increases the punishment by way of punishing the offender
for getting punished.</p>

<p>The system enhances the power and position of the
non-com. enormously, and undoubtedly makes for tremendous
discipline&mdash;and some injustice and tyranny.</p>

<p>All was well this morning, however, and the great
man's iron face remained impassive, and his hard mouth
unopened.</p>

<p>We took our Lebel rifles from the rack, put our bayonets
in their frogs, and clattered down to the parade-ground at
five-thirty, on that glorious cold morning.</p>

<p>The battalion marched away to field-exercises, and
the recruits were formed up, told off by <i>escouades,</i>
each under a corporal, and taken out to the "plateau," a
vast drill-ground near the <i>village nègre,</i> for physical
training, which to-day was simply steady running. It was
nothing much for young athletes like us three, but a little
cruel for half-starved or out-of-condition men, who had
not run for some time.</p>

<p>On other mornings the physical culture took the form of
gymnastics, boxing, or a long route-march.</p>

<p>On our return to barracks, wet and warm, we had our
morning meal of <i>soupe</i> and bread, and a quarter-litre
of good wine. Tin plates and <i>gamelles</i> were rattled out
of hanging-cupboards, and we sat at the long tables that
occupied the centre of the big room. There was meat as
well as vegetables in my excellent stew, and the bread,
though grey, was palatable, and more than sufficient in
quantity.</p>

<p>After a rest, the recruits had a lecture, and after
that, squad and company drill, while the battalion did
attack-formation exercise on the plateau.</p>

<p>After this we were set to work with brooms and
wheel-barrows at tidying up around the barracks, and were
then free to go to the <i>lavabo</i> to wash and dry our white
uniforms.</p>

<p>At five o'clock we got our second meal, exactly like the
first, and were then finished for the day, save in so far
as we had to prepare for the next, in the way of cleaning
and polishing the leather and metal of our arms and
equipment&mdash;no small task, especially with stuff fresh
from store.</p>

<p>Here the poverty of the Legion again helped us, for no
man need do a stroke more than he wishes of this kind of
work, while he has a halfpenny to spare.</p>

<p>We soon found that it was a real and genuine kindness
to let a comrade have a go at our leather and brass,
our rifles and bayonets, our dirty fatigue suits and
underclothing; for, to him, a job meant the means of
getting a packet of <i>caporal</i> cigarettes, a bottle of wine,
a postage-stamp, a change of diet, a piece of much-needed
soap, or a chance to replenish his cleaning materials.</p>

<p>We three did not shirk our work, by any means, but
very often, when weary to death, or anxious to go out of
barracks, we gave our <i>astiquage</i> work to one of the many
who begged to be allowed to do it.</p>

<p>The recruits progressed with astonishing speed, being
practically all trained soldiers before they joined,
and picked up the necessary Legion-French remarkably
rapidly.</p>

<p>We three very soon became good soldiers, aided by our
intelligence, strength, sobriety, athletic training, sense
of discipline, knowledge of French, and a genuine desire to
make good.</p>

<p>More fortunate than most, we were well-educated and
had "background"; a little money (thanks to Michael's
forethought), which was wealth in the Legion; good habits,
self-control, and a public-school training; and we were
inoffensive by reason of possessing the consideration,
courtesy, and self-respecting respect for others proper to
gentlemen.</p>

<p>Less fortunate than most, we were accustomed to varied
food, comfortable surroundings, leisure, a great deal of
mental and physical recreation, spaciousness of life, and
above all, <i>privacy.</i></p>

<p>But at first, everything was new and strange, remarkable
and romantic; we were Soldiers of Fortune, we were
together, and we were by no means unhappy.</p>

<p>But oh, how I longed to see Isobel!</p>

<p>And gradually, wondering thoughts as to the "Blue Water"
and its whereabouts, retired to the back of my mind, for
the world was too much with us altogether, for there to
be time available for introspection or day-dreaming. Our
days were too full and busy and our nights all too short
for thought. They were scarce long enough for the deep
dreamless sleep necessary to men who were worked as we
were.</p>

<p>And how we blessed Sundays&mdash;those glorious
life-saving days of complete rest.</p>

<p>On our first Sunday morning in the Legion, we three sat
on Michael's bed and held a "Council of War," as we had so
often done, in the days of the Band, at Brandon Abbas.</p>

<p>It was decided that I should write to Isobel, telling
her where I was, and saying that I knew where Michael and
Digby were, and could send them any messages or news.</p>

<p>Isobel was to use her discretion as to admitting that
she knew where I was, but if she did admit it, she was
to add&mdash;the simple truth&mdash;that she had not the
slightest idea as to where the others were.</p>

<p>This plan was Michael's, and as he seemed keen on it,
and neither Digby nor I saw anything against it, we adopted
it, and I wrote a letter which she could show to Aunt
Patricia, or not, as she liked.</p>

<p>I wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Légionnaire John Smith,<br>
No.18896, 7th Company, Premier Étranger,<br>
Sidi-bel-Abbès, Algeria.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Isobel</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">
A letter to the above address will find me. Michael
and Digby know it also. I can send them any messages, or
news, from Brandon Abbas. Neither of them is in England.
Either of them will let me know if he changes his present
address. I am in excellent health. I shall write again if I
hear from you. I am so anxious to know what is happening at
home.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>Michael and Digby approved of this, as it opened up
a line of communication with Brandon Abbas, but made no
change in the situation.</p>

<p>From what we had learnt, after discreet enquiries
of Boldini, we had quite come to the conclusion that
the English police would take no steps in pursuit of
the legionary, John Smith, so long as he remained in
the Legion, even though there were strong reasons for
suspecting him to be John Geste who had disappeared at the
time of the jewel-robbery.</p>

<p>But I privately inserted a scrap of paper on which was a
message of undying and unalterable love to my sweetheart.
This she could destroy, and the letter she could produce
for Aunt Patricia's information or not, as might seem best
to her in whatever circumstances arose....</p>

<p>On a Saturday night, a fortnight later, I got a private
and personal love-letter that made me wildly happy and
as proud as a peacock; and, with it, a long letter that I
could send to Michael and Digby if I wished to do so.</p>

<p>This latter said that things were going on at Brandon
Abbas exactly as before.</p>

<p>Aunt Patricia had, so far, communicated neither with
the police nor with anybody else, and had taken no steps,
whatsoever, in the matter.</p>

<p>Apparently she had accepted the fact that one of the
three Gestes had stolen the "Blue Water"&mdash;and,
extraordinarily and incredibly, she was just doing nothing
at all about it, but simply awaiting Uncle Hector's
return.</p>

<p>She had released Augustus, Claudia, and Isobel herself,
from the prohibition as to leaving the house, and had
asked no questions of any of them since the day that I
had disappeared. On that day, she had accepted the solemn
assurance of Augustus, Claudia, and Isobel, that they knew
<i>absolutely nothing</i> as to where the Gestes had gone, which
of them was the thief, or whether they were in league.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand her," she wrote, "nor get at what
she thinks and feels. She fully accepts, apparently, my
exculpation of Gussie (and incidentally of myself at the
same time) and scorns to suspect Claudia. She has told
us that we are absolutely free from suspicion, and she
wishes us to make no further reference to the matter at
all. Gussie is, of course, unbearable. He has '<i>known all
along that you would come to a bad end&mdash;the three of
you,</i>' but while certain that you are all in it together,
he believes that you, John, are the actual thief. I told
him that I had a belief too, and when he asked what it was,
I said, '<i>I believe that if you gave your whole soul to
it, Gussie, you might possibly, some day, be fit to clean
John's boots&mdash;or those of any other Geste....</i>' I also
said that if he ever uttered another word on the subject
I would discover, when the police came, that I had made a
mistake in thinking that it was <i>his</i> arm I had held when
the light failed!... Am I not a beast? But he does make me
so angry with his sneers and conscious rectitude, the mean
little rascal.</p>

<p>However, as I have said, the police have not come yet,
and absolutely nothing is being done. The servants haven't
a ghost of an idea that anything is wrong, and life goes on
just as if you three had merely gone up to Oxford for this
term. Burdon must wonder that you all went so suddenly and
with so little kit, but I don't suppose it interests him
much.</p>

<p>I don't know <i>what</i> Uncle Hector will say about the
delay in going to Scotland Yard! It almost looks as though
Aunt wants the culprit to escape, or else feels that Uncle
Hector would prefer that there should be no public scandal
if it could possibly be avoided, and the sapphire recovered
privately. Somehow I can't think that Aunt would have any
mercy on the thief, though&mdash;and I really don't think
she'd suppose Uncle Hector would prefer this delay to
scandal. Surely he is not the person to care twopence about
scandal, and he certainly is not the person to approve a
delay that may make recovery impossible. I can't make it
out <i>at all.</i></p>

<p>Fancy Uncle Hector robbed of thirty thousand pounds!
He'll go raving mad and kill people!</p>

<p>Oh, John, where <i>is</i> the wretched thing? And how long
will it be before you can all come back? I shall wire to
you at once if it turns up, and I shall certainly come and
see you if you don't come soon&mdash;for it's my private
opinion that you are all three together!..."</p>

<p>I produced this letter for Michael and Digby to read, at
our Sunday "Council of War" next morning.</p>

<p>Michael read it without a word of comment, and with an
inscrutable face.</p>

<p>Digby said, "The little darling! I bet she comes out to
Sidi if the thing doesn't turn up!" and he bounced on the
bed, with glee, at the idea.</p>

<p>"Wonder what Uncle Hector will do?" said Michael. "Poor
Aunt Patricia will get a thin time...."</p>

<p>"For not preventing us from pinching it?" jeered
Digby.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;for not calling in the police at once," said
Michael.</p>

<p>"I wonder why she didn't," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Michael. "Funny, isn't it?"</p>

<p>And yawning and turning round from the window, out of
which we had been looking, I noticed that Boldini was
asleep on his bed behind us. It was curious how quietly
that man could move about, with his cat-like steps and
silent ways.</p>

<h3>§ 8</h3>

<p class="first">Recruit-days passed swiftly away, and we
were too busy and too tired to be wretched.</p>

<p>From five in the morning till five in the evening we
were hard at it, and after that we had plenty to do in
preparing our kit and accoutrements for the morrow.</p>

<p>That done, or given to a needy comrade to do, we dressed
in our walking-out uniforms, according to the particular
<i>ordre du jour,</i> and went for a walk in tawdry hybrid Sidi,
or to hear the Legion's magnificent band in the Place Sadi
Carnot, or the Jardin Publique. Usually we three went
together, but sometimes the two Americans and St. André
would accompany us, and Boldini whenever we could not shake
him off.</p>

<p>He stuck to us closer than a brother sticketh, and after
his first usefulness was over (and paid for), as we gained
experience and learnt the ropes, we certainly did not
desire his society for himself alone.</p>

<p>But apparently he desired ours, and ardently.</p>

<p>The more we saw of the two Americans, the better we
liked them, and the same applied to St. André&mdash;but
precisely the converse was true of Boldini.</p>

<p>However, we were not troubled by his presence when Buddy
went out with us, for the American would have none of him,
and scrupled not to say so with painful definiteness.</p>

<p>"Get to hell outa this, Cascara Sagrada," he would say
truculently. "Don' wantcha. Go gnaw circles in the meadow
and keep away from me with both feet.... Skoot, son," or
some equally discouraging address.</p>

<p>Painful as this was, we were glad to profit by it, for
Boldini waxed more and more offensively familiar. Put
into words, the message of his manner to us three (his
implications, and the general atmosphere he endeavoured to
create) was:</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;we're all scoundrels together! Why this
silly pretence of innocence and superiority? Let's be a
united gang and share all loot" kind of idea.</p>

<p>I did not understand Buddy's virulent detestation of the
man, though; and when I asked him about it one day, when he
flatly refused to let Boldini join us in the canteen, all
he could reply was:</p>

<p>"He's a rattlesnake with a silent rattle, and he's
Lejaune's spy. You wanta watch out. He's on your trail fer
somethin'," and Hank had confirmed this with a drawled,
"Shore, Bo, watch the critter."</p>

<p>The first time that Boldini showed objection to Buddy's
rudeness, the latter promptly invited him to come below
and bring his fists&mdash;an invitation which Boldini
declined (and was for ever the admitted inferior, in
consequence).</p>

<p>Another person who most certainly watched us, and with
a baleful boding eye, was Colour-Sergeant Lejaune himself,
now, alas, Sergeant-Major.</p>

<p>We were, however, far too keen, careful, and capable to
give him the opportunity he obviously desired.</p>

<p>When he came in for room-inspection, he made no pretence
of not giving us and our kit, accoutrements, and bedding,
a longer and more searching inspection than he gave to
anybody else except Buddy.</p>

<p>When I met the long hard stare of his hot and cruel
eyes, I thought of a panther or some other feral beast
whose sole mental content was hate....</p>

<p>"We're sure <i>for</i> it, pard," said Buddy to me, after one
of these inspections. "Our name's mud. That section-boss
makes me feel like when I butted into a grizzly-b'ar. On'y
I liked the b'ar better."</p>

<p>"Yep," agreed Hank. "He's a grizzly-b'ar.... But I've
shot a grizzly-b'ar, I hev.</p>

<p>"They ain't immortial," he added mildly.</p>

<p>It was also quite clear that Corporal Dupré had found
that he had said the wrong thing when he replied to
Lejaune's enquiry as to what sort of unspecified animals we
were, by declaring that we were model recruits whose sole
object appeared to be the meriting of his approval.</p>

<p>Corporal Dupré was not a bad fellow at heart, but "he
had got to live," and it grew clearer and clearer, as the
weeks went by, that we three could do nothing right and
Boldini nothing wrong.</p>

<p>Our chief offence was that we would commit no offence,
but we felt we walked on very thin ice....</p>

<p>In less than a couple of months we were dismissed
recruit-drills and became full-blown <i>légionnaires.</i></p>

<p>Above the head of my bed appeared a printed paste-board
card, bearing the legend, <i>John Smith, No.</i> 18896, <i>Soldat</i>
2<i><sup>ème</sup> Classe,</i> and I was a (second-class)
Soldier of Fortune, taking my place in the ranks of my
battalion. In time I should be a <i>Soldat</i> 1<i><sup>ère</sup>
Classe,</i> if I were good.</p>

<p>Michael, Digby, the two Americans, Maris, and St. André
came to the battalion at the same time, and our little
party kept together.</p>

<p>We now learned what marching really is, and why the
Legion is known in the Nineteenth Army Corps as the
<i>cavalerie à pied.</i> The route-marches were of appalling
length at an unvarying five kilometres an hour. Over
English roads, in the English climate, and with the English
soldier's kit, they would have been incredible. Over sand
and desert stones, under the African sun, and with the much
heavier kit of the legionary (which includes tent-canvas,
firewood, a blanket, and a spare uniform), they were
infinitely more so.</p>

<p>On one occasion we took a stroll of five hundred miles,
marching continuously at thirty miles a day, as the Colonel
thought we wanted "airing."</p>

<p>In addition to these marches, we had admirable training
in skirmishing and scouting, plenty of company and
battalion drill, first-aid, field engineering, varied
rifle-range work, and the theory of infantry warfare.</p>

<p>By the time we three felt ourselves old soldiers,
we also began to feel we were stagnating mentally, and
becoming mechanical, bored, and stale. Night after night of
strolling about Sidi-bel-Abbès was not good enough, and our
brains were demanding exercise.</p>

<p>Michael decreed that we should study Arabic, both for
the good of our souls and with a view to future usefulness
at such time as we should be generals entrusted with
diplomatic missions or military governorships.</p>

<p>Our Arabic proved useful before then.</p>

<p>We got books from the library, engaged a half-caste
clerk, who worked in the <i>Bureau Arabe,</i> to meet us for an
hour, four evenings a week, for conversation; and took to
haunting Arab cafés instead of French ones.</p>

<p>We distinctly liked the dignified and courteous men with
whom we talked over the wonderful coffee.</p>

<p>We made rapid progress and, after a time, made a point
of talking Arabic to each other. It is an easy language to
learn, especially in a country where it is spoken.</p>

<p>And still Boldini haunted us like our shadow, Corporal
Dupré waited for a chance to report us, and Lejaune bided
his time.</p>

<p>But we were wary and we were unexceptionable soldiers.
Even these skilful fault-finders and fault-makers could
not get an opportunity, and we were favourably noticed by
our Lieutenant (Debussy) and Captain (Renouf), of whom we
saw all too little. Theirs to lead us in man&oelig;uvres
and war, the non-commissioned officers' to prepare us to
be led. And in this the officers assisted them only by
their authority. In every possible way, and some impossible
ways, they upheld the power of the non-coms., backed them
up on every occasion, took their word for everything, and
supported them blindly.</p>

<p>There was no appeal. What the non-commissioned officer
said, was true; and what he did, was right, as against
the private soldier. The resulting discipline was
wonderful&mdash; and so was the bitterness, hatred, and
despair of some of the victims of injustice and personal
spite.</p>

<p>A sergeant had only to continue punishing a victim, for
the latter to earn the unfavourable notice of the officer,
when the latter read the punishment book, and to find his
punishment doubled&mdash;with a warning to beware lest
something really serious happened to him.</p>

<p>The Americans were not as lucky, or not as careful, as
we three. For one thing, they sometimes drank the appalling
maddening filth sold in the low-class wine-shops of the
Spanish quarter or the Ghetto. Crude alcohol made from
figs, rice, or wood, and known as <i>bapédi, tchum-tchum,</i>
and <i>genièvre,</i> would make Buddy's temper explosive and
uncertain, while it rendered Hank indiscriminatingly
affectionate and apt to fall heavily upon the neck of
the Sergeant of the Guard, when the latter admitted him,
singing joyously, in the watches of the night.</p>

<p>Then was Lejaune happy, and reminded them of how they
had opened their mouths in his presence, upon the evening
of their entry into the Legion.</p>

<p>When they were confined to barracks, he would have the
defaulters' roll called at odd times, in the hope of their
missing it, and, when they were in the <i>salle de police,</i>
would see that the Sergeant of the Guard turned them out
hourly, under pretence of suspecting that they had tobacco
or drink.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would go himself to their cells, in the
middle of the night, rouse them with a sudden roar, and
give a swift, harsh order, in the hope that it would be
disobeyed through resentment or drunken stupidity.</p>

<p>I think he would have given a month's pay to have
succeeded in goading one of them into striking him. It
was my constant fear that Buddy would do so. And daily we
dinned this into their ears, and prayed that something of
the sort would not happen. However, they were old soldiers
and wily Americans....</p>

<p>And so the months passed, and every week I heard from my
darling. Nothing happened at Brandon Abbas.</p>

<p>Gussie had gone to Sandhurst, the Chaplain was about
again, and Uncle Hector had postponed his home-coming after
all, and had gone to Kashmir to shoot bear, as he had had
poor sport with tiger in the Central Provinces.</p>

<p>No reference was ever made to the missing "Blue Water,"
no questions had been asked of Isobel, and she had
volunteered no information as to our whereabouts and her
being in communication with me.</p>

<p>Also she would "come into" her money on her next
birthday, and she was then going to do a little travelling,
and intended to wander in Algeria!</p>

<p>"Hope she comes before we go&mdash;or that we don't go
before she comes," said Digby, on learning this last piece
of information&mdash;for we were full of hope that we
should be among those selected for the big special draft
that was going south before long.</p>

<p>Everyone knew that a battalion, a thousand strong,
was going to "demonstrate" on the border shortly, and
"demonstrating" meant further peaceful penetration with
the bayonet, active service, and chances of distinction,
decoration, and promotion.</p>

<p>If we did not go we should be bitterly disappointed,
and lapse into mere bored and disillusioned victims of a
monotonous soul-killing routine, daily doing the drill in
which we were perfect; cursing the guard-mounting, sentry-
go, and endless "fatigues"; learning the things we knew by
heart; performing the exercises and operations we could
do blindfold; and dragging ourselves through the killing
route-marches that we hated.</p>

<p>But what a cruel thing if we were selected and sent off
just as Isobel was coming!</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we were not taken (and we were
still very junior soldiers), we should at any rate have
Isobel's visit to Sidi-bel-Abbès to look forward to.</p>

<p>So great was my longing to see her that, had I been
alone, I really think that I should, at times, have toyed
with the idea of "going on pump," "making the promenade,"
which all <i>légionnaires</i> continually discuss and frequently
attempt. This "going on pump," whatever that may mean,
is the Legion name for deserting, and generally consists
in slow preparation and swift capture, or a few days'
thirst-agony in the desert, and ignominious return, or else
in unspeakable torture and mutilation at the hands of the
Arabs.</p>

<p>Less than one in a hundred succeed in escaping, for,
in addition to the patrols, the desert, and the Arabs,
the native armed-police <i>goumiers</i> receive a reward of
twenty-five francs a head for the return of deserters, dead
or alive.</p>

<p>Being matchless trackers, well-armed, good shots, and
brave men, they are very successful bloodhounds.</p>

<p>However, the attempt is frequently made by maddened
victims of injustice or of sheer monotony and hardship,
and their punishment, when caught, varies from leniency to
cruel severity, according to the degree of <i>cafard</i> from
which they were suffering, and to the amount of uniform and
kit they may have lost.</p>

<p>One man, whom I knew personally, when under sentence to
appear before the supreme court-martial of Oran, which in
his case meant certain death, got clean away, and was known
to have escaped from the country.</p>

<p>Several, whom I knew, went off into the desert and were
either found dead and mutilated, or never heard of more;
and many either escaped and surrendered again, or were
brought back running, or dragging on the ground, at the end
of a cord tied to the saddle of an Arab police <i>goum...</i>
.</p>

<p>However, we had come here to make careers for ourselves
as Soldiers of Fortune, and to become Generals in the Army
of France, as other foreigners had done, from the ranks of
the Legion. And we did our utmost to achieve selection for
the picked battalion that was to march south for the next
forward leap of the apostles of pacific penetration (or
pacification of the newly-penetrated areas) of the Sahara
of the Soudan.</p>

<h3>§ 9</h3>

<p class="first">One evening, at about this period of our
depôt life, Maris, the Swiss ex-courier, came to me as I
lay on my cot, resting and awaiting the return of Michael
and Digby from <i>corvée.</i> Said he:</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you, Monsieur Smith. You have
done me many a good turn, and you saved me from prison when
my tunic was stolen and I could not have replaced it in
time for the <i>adjudant's</i> inspection.... Will you and your
brothers meet me at Mustapha's at six to-night? It will be
worth your while. We shall be safe enough there, especially
if we talk in English..." and he glanced apprehensively
round the busy room, and jerked his head towards Colonna
and an Italian named Guantaio, who were working together at
the table.</p>

<p>I thanked him and said that I would tell my brothers,
and that if they returned in time, from the "fatigue" on
which they were engaged, we would look in at Mustapha's.</p>

<p>When Michael and Digby came in from the job of sweeping
and weeding, for which they had been seized by a sergeant,
I told them what Maris had said.</p>

<p>"Better go," remarked Michael. "Maris is the clean
potato, I think. No harm in hearing it anyhow."</p>

<p>Mustapha's was an Arab café, where we got splendid
coffee very cheaply&mdash;thick, black, and sweet, with a
drop of vanilla, a drop of hashish oil, or of opium, a drop
of orange-essence, and other flavourings.</p>

<p>Here we rested ourselves on a big and very low divan,
with a solid wall behind us, and awaited Maris, who came a
few minutes later.</p>

<p>"It's like this, my friends," said he, in his excellent
English, when we had got our little clay cups of coffee
steaming on the floor in front of us. "I don't want to
make what you call the mare's nest, isn't it? But Boldini
is up to his tricks again.... I have heard a lot about him
from Vaerren and from old <i>légionnaires</i> who served with
him before.... He is the bad hat, that one. They say that
Lejaune will get him made a corporal soon.... Well, I have
noticed things, I.</p>

<p>"Yes. And last night I was sitting in the Tlemcen
Gardens. It was getting dark. Behind the seat were bushes,
and another path ran by the other side. Some <i>légionnaires</i>
came along it, and sat down on a seat that must have been
just behind mine. They were talking Italian. I know Italian
well, and I always listen to foreign languages.... Yes, I
shall be a courier again when the little trouble has blown
over about the man I taught not to steal my fiancée, while
I travel. Yes...."</p>

<p>He paused dramatically, and with much eye-rolling and
gesticulation continued:</p>

<p>"Boldini it was, and Colonna and Guantaio. He had been
trying to get them to do something and they were afraid.
Boldini, for some reason, also wanted Colonna to change
beds with him, to make this something easier to do.</p>

<p>"'<i>Yes, and what if I am caught?</i>' said Colonna.</p>

<p>"'<i>You're as good a man as he is,</i>' said Boldini.</p>

<p>"'<i>And what about his brothers? Yes&mdash;and his
friends the Americans?</i>' asked Colonna.</p>

<p>"'<i>And what about</i> YOUR <i>friends&mdash;me and Guantaio
and Vogué and Gotto?</i> WHAT ABOUT SERGEANT-MAJOR LEJAUNE,
<i>if someone makes a row, and Corporal Dupré reports
the man to him and I give my humble evidence as an
eye-witness&mdash;in private? Eh?...</i> "<i>Brothers,</i>" <i>you
say! Aren't Lejaune and I like brothers?</i>'</p>

<p>"'<i>Why not do it yourself then?</i>' said Guantaio.</p>

<p>"'<i>Because I'm going to be made corporal soon,</i>' replied
Boldini, '<i>and I mustn't be in any rows.... Ah, when I'm
corporal, I shall be able to look after my friends, eh?</i>'
Then he went on to remind them of what they could do with a
thousand francs&mdash;more than fifty years of their pay,
for a two-minute job.</p>

<p>"Then Guantaio, who seems to be a pluckier dog than
Colonna, said:</p>

<p>"'<i>How do you know he has got it?</i>' and Boldini replied,
'<i>Because I heard them say so. They are a gang. Swell
thieves. They have asked me if thieves in the Legion are
given up to the police. When the third one joined at Oran,
I guessed it from what they said. And they were flash
with their money. They got together at night, out in the
courtyard, and I crept up behind a buttress close to them
and listened. I could not hear everything, but they spoke
of a jewel-robbery and thirty thousand pounds. The one they
call</i> "<i>Le Beau</i>" <i>said he kept it like the</i> CANGURO...
<i>the kangaroo... keeps its young! I heard him plainly.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And where does the</i> CANGURO <i>keep its young! In
a pouch on its stomach, and that is where this thief,
Légionnaire Guillaume Brown, keeps this jewel. In a
pouch.... He wears it day and night.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And it's a thousand francs for the man that gets me
the pouch. And I'll take the chance and risk of getting the
jewel sold in the Ghetto for more than a thousand.... Some
of those Ghetto Jews are millionaires.... I'd put the lamp
out. One man could gag and hold him, while the other got
it, and they could run to their beds in the dark.</i>'...</p>

<p>"And much more of the same sort he talked, egging them
on, and then they went away, but with nothing settled,"
continued Maris.</p>

<p>Digby and I burst into laughter at mention of the
kangaroo, and Michael turned, smiling to Maris.</p>

<p>When the latter stopped, Digby asked if Boldini had not
also divulged that he wore a sapphire eye, and I enquired
if the wily Italian had not observed a lump in Digby's
cheek, where a simian pouch concealed a big jewel.</p>

<p>"The fool overheard an elaborate joke," said Michael to
Maris; "but we're very much obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is the fool all right," said Maris; "but he is
also the knave.</p>

<p>"Knave of diamonds!" he added, with a grin. "I just
tell you because I like you English gentlemen, and it is
just possible that they may try to steal your money-belt,
if they think there is a chance of getting something
valuable."</p>

<p>We filled the worthy Maris up with <i>cous-cous</i> and
<i>galettes</i> (pancakes and honey), and strolled back to
barracks.</p>

<p>When we were alone, I said to Michael:</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> wear a money-belt, Beau. Let me have it at
night for a bit--in case these gentle Italians have been
persuaded, and something happens in the dark."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"Well," replied I, "you could favour them with your full
personal attention, untroubled with grosser cares, if you
had no property to protect. Also you could establish the
fact that you don't wear a money-belt at night."</p>

<p>"I'd sooner establish despondency and alarm in the
thief, thanks," said Michael.</p>

<p>"What a lark!" chuckled Digby, "I'm going to wear a
brick under my sash and swear it's a ruby. Anyone that can
pinch it while I slumber, can have it for keeps.... I must
find this Boldini lad."...</p>

<p>But, personally, I did not regard the matter as
precisely a lark.</p>

<p>I had heard of Italian knives, and it seemed to me
that a man might well be found dead in his bed, with a
knife&mdash;or his own bayonet&mdash;through his heart, and
nobody be any the wiser.... And even if justice could be
done, which was doubtful, that would not bring the dead man
back to life.</p>

<p>We had been long enough in the Legion to know its queer
code of morals, and on the subject of theft the law was
very peculiar, very strict, and very savage.</p>

<p>One might steal any article of uniform, and be no thief.
It was a case of "robbery no stealing." To take another
man's uniform or kit was merely " to decorate oneself,"
and decorating oneself was a blameless pastime, regarded
universally as profitable, amusing, and honourable. Public
opinion was not in the slightest degree against the
time-honoured practice, and the act was concealed from none
save the owner of the sequestrated property.</p>

<p>This was all very silly, for it was a most serious
matter, involving very heavy punishment, for a man to be
found to be short of so much as a strap when "showing-down"
kit for inspection by the <i>adjudant.</i> Nevertheless,
you might "decorate yourself" with a tunic, a sash, an
overcoat, a pair of boots, a pair of trousers, or the
whole of a man's "washing" from the line in the <i>lavabo,</i>
and no one thought one penny the worse of you, save the
unfortunate whom you had robbed.</p>

<p>The idea was, that if you were short of an article
of equipment (after all, the property of <i>Madame la
République,</i> and not of the individual), you must help
yourself where you could, your victim must help himself
where he could, his victim must do likewise, and so on. And
whoever was caught out, in the end, as short of kit, was
the fool and the loser in this childish game of "beggar my
neighbour" (of his uniform).</p>

<p>Of his uniform, public property&mdash;but of nothing
else.</p>

<p>Anything else was private property and sacred. To steal
private property was not self-"decoration" at all, but
theft; and theft, in that collection of the poorest of poor
men, was the ultimate horrible crime, infinitely worse than
murder. The legionary did not value his life much, but he
valued his few tiny possessions beyond estimation.</p>

<p>With the abomination of theft, the Legion itself dealt,
and dealt most drastically, for it could not be tolerated
where everything private was so valuable, and so easily
stolen if a thief should arise in the midst.</p>

<p>There was no thought of appeal to Authority in a case of
theft; nor was there either enquiry or comment on the part
of Authority when a case occurred and was punished by the
men themselves, according to Legion law and custom.</p>

<p>And we were soon to see the law in operation and to
behold an example of the custom....</p>

<p>Since Michael absolutely refused to let me wear his
money-belt for him at night, I decided that I must think of
some other plan&mdash;in view of this story told by Maris.
I did not doubt its truth for one moment, as it merely
confirmed, in particular, what I had thought and Buddy
had voiced, in general&mdash; that Boldini's interest in
our comings and goings, our conversation and habits, our
antecedents and private affairs, had a sinister cause and
object.</p>

<p>At first I thought of arranging with Digby that he and I
should take turns to keep watch, but I discarded this plan
as impossible. Nobody who worked as long and as hard as we
did, could possibly lie awake in bed, and Michael would
soon have "put an end to our nonsense" if we had sat up to
guard him.</p>

<p>I then thought of going to Boldini and saying:</p>

<p>"Kangaroos have a horrible kick, my friend," or, "Better
not let me see you putting the light out, Boldini," or
even frankly and plainly promising to kill him, if anybody
attempted to rob my brother.</p>

<p>After pondering the matter and consulting Digby, who did
not take as serious a view of it as I did, I had the bright
idea of getting the advice of an older, worldly-wiser,
and far cleverer person than myself&mdash;and appealed to
Buddy.</p>

<p>What he did not know about crooks and the best ways of
defeating them was not worth knowing, and his experiences
in the Texas Rangers had been those of detective,
policeman, watch-dog, and soldier combined.</p>

<p>I accordingly walked out one evening with Hank and
Buddy, "set the drinks up" at the Bar de Madagascar off
the Rue de Daya, and told them that I had excellent reason
to believe that Boldini was arranging with Colonna and
Guantaio to rob my brother, one night.</p>

<p>"My brother can look after himself, of course," said I;
"but these curs have got hold of the idea that he has a
marvellous jewel which we three have stolen.... What I'm
wondering is whether Guantaio, who looks like a <i>pucca</i>
Sicilian bandit, would stick a knife into him, to make sure
of getting his belt. That's the only thing that worries
me."</p>

<p>"Fergit it, son," was Buddy's prompt reply. "Those slobs
would never do that. Don't trust each other enough, for
one thing. Far too risky, for another. That sort of poor
thieving boob wouldn't dare. Why, one drop of blood on his
hands or shirt, or one yell outa your brother, an' he'd be
taken red-handed."</p>

<p>"Shore," agreed Hank. "Not in barracks they wouldn't.
Git him up a side-street and bash him on the head, more
like. Anybody mighta done it there. Lots o' guys git done
in fer their sash an' bayonet in the <i>village nègre,</i> an'
them low dives an' hash-joints in the Spanish quarter....
Don't let him go around alone, an' he's safe enough."</p>

<p>This was reassuring, and it was common sense. It would,
of course, take a very cool, skilful, and courageous
murderer to kill a man sleeping in a room with thirty
others.</p>

<p>"I don't know so much," I said, arguing against myself
and for the sake of complete reassurance. "Suppose Guantaio
or Colonna simply crept to the bed and drove a bayonet
through the blankets and through his heart. There'd be no
bloodstains on the murderer..."</p>

<p>"Not when he started monkeying with the belt?" put in
Buddy. "And wouldn't there be no sound from your brother?
Not a cheep outa him? Fergit it, I say."</p>

<p>"Look at here, Bo," argued Hank. "Figger it was you
agoin' to stick me. How'd you know where my heart was, me
curled up under the blankets, and nearly dark an' all?
How'd you know as everybody was asleep all right? How'd
you know there wouldn't be noise?... Shucks! 'Tain't
horse-sense.... Nope. These legendaries don't stand fer
murder in the barrack-room, still less fer robbery, and
least of all fer bein' woke up at night outa their due and
lawful sleep."...</p>

<p>"See, boy," interrupted Buddy at this point, "that
barrack-room is just your brother's plumb safest place. As
fer his kohinoor di'mond, I allow he can sure look after
that himself."</p>

<p>"Shore thing," agreed Hank.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," said I. "If there's no fear of his being
murdered in his sleep, there's an end of the matter. I'd
rather like Boldini to go and try to rob him."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go fer to say as much as that, Bo," demurred
Buddy. "I'd undertake to clear your brother out every night
of his life&mdash;every cent outa his belt&mdash;and the
belt likewise also, too.... P'r'aps Mister Cascara Sagrada
could do as much," and we smiled, both thinking of the
occasion upon which Buddy had "minded" my money for me.</p>

<p>"Look at here, Bo," said Hank at this. "I gotta little
idee. Surpose I goes to Cascara an' ses to him, '<i>Pari</i>'
I ses, '<i>if that English legendary, Willyerm Brown,
No.</i> 18897, <i>gits robbed, I'm sure agwine ter do you an
onjustice. I'm agwine ter beat you up most ugly. So's yer
own father, if you had one, wouldn't know yer, an</i>' <i>yer
mother'd disown yer,</i>' or something discouragin' like
that."</p>

<p>I thanked this large slow person, but declined, assuring
him that we could take excellent care of ourselves, and
I had only wanted to know if murder were a possible
contingency.</p>

<p>"Not inside the barracks. Not till hell pops," said
Buddy.</p>

<p>"Sure thing," agreed Hank. "But don't let him prowl
around no boweries nor hootch-joints, on his lonesome.
Nope."</p>

<p>"An' tell him from me that I'll mind his money-belt an'
be responserble, if he likes," offered Buddy. "Then he
can sleep free and easy like, an' also deal faithful with
any guy as comes snooping around in the night, without
having to waste time feeling if his gold-dust is there all
right...."</p>

<p>I again thanked him, changed the subject, and soon
afterwards got them back to barracks, "a-settin' sober
on the water-waggon, a credit to all men," as Hank
observed.</p>

<p>And, this very night, there happened that which must
have given certain gentlemen of our barrack-room to think,
and to think seriously, of abandoning any schemes for their
quick enrichment, had they been entertaining them.</p>

<p>I was awakened by a crash and a shout.... Springing up,
instantly awake, I saw two men struggling on the floor
near Michael's bed. The one on top, pinning the other down
with a hand on his throat, was Michael. As I leapt from my
bed, I was aware that the room was alive and that men were
running with angry shouts to see what, and who, had broken
their sacred sleep&mdash;a horrible violation of strictest
Legion law.</p>

<p>"Wring the sneakin' coyote's neck, Bo," shouted
Buddy.</p>

<p>"'<i>Learn him to be a toad,</i>' Beau," quoted Digby,
and with cries of "Thief! Thief!" the wave of shouting,
gesticulating men swept over the two and bore one of them
to the surface. It was neither Guantaio nor Colonna,
neither Gotto nor Vogué&mdash;one of whom I had fully
expected to see.</p>

<p>White-faced, struggling, imploring, in the grip of
a dozen indignantly outraged and savagely ferocious
<i>légionnaires,</i> was a man from the next room.</p>

<p>I looked round for Boldini.</p>

<p>He was sound asleep in his bed! And so was Corporal
Dupré in his, and with his face to the wall&mdash;both of
them men whom the squeak of a mouse would awaken.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, <i>scélérat?</i>" shouted half a
score of fierce voices as the man was pulled hither and
thither, buffeted, shaken, and savagely struck.</p>

<p>"Speak up, you Brown! What about it?" roared Schwartz,
who had got the man by the throat. "Was he stealing?"</p>

<p>"On the table with him," yelled Brandt.</p>

<p>"Yes, come on. Crucify the swine," bawled the huge
bearded Schwartz, shaking his victim as a terrier shakes a
rat.</p>

<p>Hank, followed by Buddy, barged into the middle of the
scrum, throwing men right and left.</p>

<p>"'Tain't one of Boldini's outfit," I heard Buddy say.</p>

<p>"Give the guy a fair trial," shouted Hank. "Lynchin' fer
hoss-thieves an' sich&mdash;but give him a trial," and he
seized the man himself. "Cough it up quick," he said to the
terrified wretch, who seemed about to faint.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," shouted Michael, in French. "He belongs
to me.... He's had enough...."</p>

<p>The crowd snarled. Several had bayonets in their
hands.</p>

<p>"I lost my way," screamed the prisoner.</p>

<p>"And found it to the bed of a man who has money,"
laughed a voice. "Legion law! On the table with him!"</p>

<p>Michael jumped on the table.</p>

<p>"Silence, you fools!" he shouted. "Listen!" and the
crowd listened. "I woke up and found the man feeling under
my pillow. I thought he was somebody belonging to the room.
Somebody I have been waiting for. Well&mdash;he isn't. Let
him go&mdash;he won't come again...."</p>

<p>At that there was a perfect yell of derision and
execration, and Michael was sent flying by a rush of angry
men.</p>

<p>While he, Digby, and I were struggling to get to the
table, the thief was flung on to it and held down; a
bayonet was driven through each of his hands, another
through each of his ears, and he lay moaning and begging
for mercy. As I got to the table, sick with disgust, with
some idea of rescuing the poor beast, I was seized from
behind and flung away again.</p>

<p>"Lie there and think about it, you thieving cur,"
shouted Schwartz to the thief.</p>

<p>"Stop your snivelling&mdash;or I'll put another through
your throat," growled Brandt.</p>

<p>Hank seized me as I knocked Haff down.</p>

<p>"Let be, Johnny," he said, enveloping me in a bear's
hug. "It's the salootary custom of the country. They
discourages thievin' in these parts. But I wish it was
Boldini they was lynchin'...."</p>

<p>I tried to shake him off, as I saw Michael spring on
Schwartz like a tiger.</p>

<p>There was a sudden cry of "<i>Guard!</i>" a swift rush in
all directions, and the guard tramped in, to find a silent
room&mdash;full of sleeping men&mdash;in the midst of which
were we three pulling bayonets out of a white wooden table,
and a whiter whimpering man.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said the Corporal of the Guard....</p>

<p>"An accident," he answered himself, and, completely
ignoring me, he turned to the stolid guard, gave the curt
order:</p>

<p>"To the hospital," and the guard partly led, and partly
carried, the wretched creature away.</p>

<p>What his name was, whether he was incited by Boldini,
or whether he was merely trying to rob a man known to have
money, I did not know.</p>

<p>As Michael caught him feeling under the pillow, it
seemed quite likely he was merely looking for a purse or
coins.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he may have tried the shelf and
<i>paquetage,</i> and then under the pillow, in the hope of
finding the alleged belt and jewel, before essaying the
far more risky business of rifling the pouch and money-
belt.</p>

<p>Talking the affair over the next day, none of us could
remember having seen Guantaio or Colonna in the fray, so I
concluded that, like Boldini, they had decided not to be
awakened by the noise.</p>

<p>As all the old <i>légionnaires</i> prophesied would be the
case, we heard nothing whatever from the authorities about
the riot and the assault upon the thief. Clearly it was
considered best to let the men enforce their own laws as
they thought fit, provided those laws were reasonable and
in the public interest.</p>

<p>When the injured man came out of hospital, we took an
interest in his movements. He proved to be a Portuguese
named Bolidar, a wharf-rat docker from Lisbon, and quite
probably an amateur of petty crime. He stuck to his absurd
tale that he had mistaken the room and was feeling his way
into what he thought was his own bed.</p>

<p>We came to the conclusion that he was either staunch to
his confederates, or else afraid to implicate them. We saw
more of him later at Zinderneuf.</p>

<p>"Leave him to me," said Buddy. "I'll loosen his
tongue&mdash;the miserable hoodlum. One night that dago
swine is agwine to tell me an' Hank the secrets of his
lovin' heart...."</p>

<p>"He'll sure sob 'em out," opined Hank.</p>

<p>But whether he was to do this under the influence of
wine or of terror, I did not gather.</p>

<p>What we did gather, a week or two later, was that we
were the most famous gang of international crooks and
jewel-thieves in Europe, and had got away with a diamond
worth over a million francs. With this we had sought safety
in the Legion, that we might lie low until the affair was
forgotten, and then sell the diamond whole, or have it cut
up, as might seem best.</p>

<p>We were Germans pretending to be English, and we had
stolen the diamond, in London, from Sir Smith, a great
English general, to whom it had been presented by the
Prince of Wales, who was in love with his sister. Buddy
solemnly informed me that Bolidar knew all this "for
certain." Bolidar had got it from a friend of ours.
No&mdash;no names&mdash;but if Hank and Buddy could get
the diamond&mdash;"rescue" it from the rascals&mdash;he,
Bolidar, was in a position to promise them a thousand
francs, <i>and</i> the protection of&mdash;someone who was in a
position to protect them.</p>

<p>"So there you are, pard," concluded Buddy, with an
amused grin. And there we were.</p>

<p>But only for another month. At the end of that time we
found ourselves in the selected draft under orders for the
south, and our chance had come of winning that distinction,
decoration, and promotion which was to be our first step on
the Path of Glory&mdash;which was to lead not to the grave
but to fame and fortune.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch204" id="ch204">IV. &mdash; THE
DESERT</a></h2>

<p class="first">WE left the depot of Sidi-bel-Abbès in the
spirit in which boys leave school at the end of the half.
The thought of escape from that deadly crushing monotony
and weariness, to active service, change, and adventure,
was inexpressibly delightful. The bitterness in my cup of
joy was the knowledge that I was going before Isobel could
visit Algeria, and that if we were sent to the far south,
and were constantly on the move, I could only hear from her
at long and irregular intervals.</p>

<p>I poured out my heart to her in a long letter, the
night before we marched; told her I was absolutely certain
I should see her again; and begged her not to waste her
youth in thinking of me if a year passed without news, as I
should be dead.</p>

<p>Having had my hour of self-pity, and having waxed
magnificently sentimental, I became severely practical,
made all preparations, tallowed my feet, and, laden
like a beast of burden, fell in, for the last time,
on the parade-ground of the Legion's barracks at
Sidi-bel-Abbès.</p>

<p>With a hundred rounds of ammunition in our pouches, joy
in our hearts, and a terrific load upon our backs, we swung
out of the gates to the music of our magnificent band,
playing the March of the Legion, never heard save when the
Legion goes on active service.</p>

<p>Where we were going, we neither knew nor cared. That
it would be a gruelling murderous march, we knew and did
not care. We should march and fight as a battalion, or
we should be broken up into companies and sections, and
garrison desert-outposts where we should be in touch with
our enemies&mdash;be they raiding Touaregs, rebellious
Arab tribes, <i>jehad-</i>preaching Moors, or fanatical
Senussi&mdash;and in a state of constant active-service.</p>

<p>Possibly we were going to take part in some
comprehensive scheme of conquest, extending French dominion
to Lake Tchad or Timbuktu. Possibly we were about to invade
and conquer Morocco once and for all.</p>

<p>Our ideas were vague and our ignorance abysmal, but
what we did know was, that we were on the road, we
carried "sharp" ammunition, we were a self-contained,
self-supporting unit of selected men, that the barracks and
their killing routine were behind us, and the freedom and
movement of active service were before us, with adventure,
change, fighting, and the chance of decoration and
promotion.</p>

<p>Merrily we sang as we tramped, passing gaily from
"<i>Voilà du Boudin</i>" to "<i>La casquette de Père Bougeaud,</i>"
"<i>Pan, pan, l'Arbi,</i>" "<i>Des marches d'Afrique,</i>" "<i>Père
Brabançon,</i>" and "<i>Soldats de la Légion,</i>" and other old
favourites of the march.</p>

<p>Michael, Digby, and I were in one "four" with Maris,
and behind us were Hank, Buddy, St. André, and Schwartz.
At night, we shared the little tent, which we could build
in a minute and a quarter, with the canvas and jointed
tent-poles that we carried. We slept on our overcoats with
our knapsacks for pillows, our rifles chained together and
the chain handcuffed to a man's wrist.</p>

<p>We were keen, we were picked men, and nobody went
sick or fell out. Had he done so, he would have died an
unpleasant death, in which thirst, Arabs, and hyenas would
have been involved.</p>

<p>We cheerfully did our utmost like men, cheerfully
grumbled like fiends, cheerfully dropped like logs at the
end of a forty-kilometre march, and cheerfully arose like
automata, at the sound of the 2 a.m. réveillé bugle.</p>

<p>We had insufficient water, insufficient rice and
macaroni, no meat nor vegetables, and insufficient bread,
and were perfectly fit and healthy. We had no helmets and
no spine-pads, we wore heavy overcoats, we had only a linen
flap hanging from our caps to protect our necks, and we had
no cases of sunstroke nor heat apoplexy.</p>

<p>And, in time, we reached Ain-Sefra and rested to recoup
and refit, the <i>fourrier-sergents</i> having a busy time,
chiefly in the matter of boots.</p>

<p>Here we learnt that the whole of the Sahara was
fermenting in one of its periodic states of unrest, simply
asking for peaceful penetration, what with Touareg raids on
protected villages, Senussi propaganda, tribal revolts, and
sporadic outbursts of mutiny and murder.</p>

<p>There was also much talk of a serious concentration in
the south-east, engineered from Kufra, and a "sympathetic
strike" on the part of the numerous and warlike tribes
along the Moroccan border.</p>

<p>When this materialised, it would be found that they
had struck simultaneously at every French outpost, fort,
and settlement, on the Saharan border from Morocco to
Tripoli.</p>

<p>The programme, then, was to carry fire and sword
northward to the sea, and sweep the surviving <i>Roumis</i> into
it, freeing the land for ever from the polluting presence
of these unbelieving dogs.</p>

<p>Let Morocco, Tunisia, Tripoli, and Egypt join
hands, and under the green banner of a purified faith
and the spiritual leadership of Our Lord the Mahdi el
Senussi, carry on the good work in the name of Allah the
All-Merciful, the Compassionate, and Mahomet his Prophet,
until Islam was again free, triumphant, and conqueror of
all....</p>

<p>This we gathered by talking to Arab <i>goumiers,</i>
marabouts, camel-drivers, and villagers, in their own
tongue; as well as from orderlies and officers' servants
who overheard the conversation of their masters at
mess....</p>

<p>From Ain-Sefra we marched to Douargala, where a large
force of all arms was concentrating, and from this place
we proceeded south, either to trail the French coat in the
sight of the Arab, or as a reconnaissance in force and a
protective screen behind which the brigade could make its
preparations at leisure and in security.</p>

<p>And, in the fullness of time, after endless desert
marching, the battalion found itself strung out along a
chain of oases between which communication was maintained
by camel-patrols, which met half-way and exchanged reports,
orders, information, cigarettes, and bad language.</p>

<p>It was at El Rasa, the last of this chain of oases
(which must have marked the course of one of those
subterranean rivers which are common in Northern Africa)
that our half-company came in contact with the Arabs and we
had our first taste of desert warfare.</p>

<p>Arab <i>goumiers</i> came in at dawn one day, riding in
haste, with the news that they had seen the camp-fires of a
big Touareg <i>harka</i> about twenty miles to the south, where
an ancient well marked the "cross-roads" of two caravan
routes, as old as civilisation; routes charted by the bones
of countless thousands of camels and of men who had trodden
them until they died of thirst, starvation, heat, disease,
or murder at the hands of Bedouin and Touareg nomads.</p>

<p>These are the oldest roads in the world and the grim
relics that line them are those of yesterday and those of
centuries ago. They were ancient when Joseph came to Egypt,
and the men and beasts that venture upon them have not
changed in fifty centuries.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">We were in touch with the enemy at last.
At any moment we might be fighting for our lives. We were
delirious with excitement.</p>

<p>At once our little force in the oasis and this Arab
<i>harka</i> became a microcosm of the whole war, and our
Lieutenant Debussy sent out a small reconnoitring force
under Sergeant-Major Lejaune, which should be to the
strung-out battalion what the battalion was to the brigade
at Douargala.</p>

<p>It was the good luck of our <i>escouade</i> to be selected
for this duty, and within half an hour of the arrival of
the <i>goumiers,</i> we were advancing <i>en tirailleur</i> in the
direction from which they had come. Over the loose, hot
sand we plodded, our scouts far in advance and our flankers
far out to left and right.</p>

<p>"Are we the bait of a trap? Or would you call us the
point of a spear?" said Michael, marching between Digby and
me.</p>

<p>"Both," replied Digby, "a bit of meat on the end of a
spear, say."</p>

<p>And I wondered how many of us would be bits of meat
before nightfall.</p>

<p>Not that I felt in the least degree apprehensive or
depressed. If I had to analyse and describe my feelings, I
should say that beneath a strong sensation of pleasurable
excitement was that undercurrent of slight nervous anxiety
which one experiences before going in to bat, or when
seated in a corner of the ring, awaiting the word "<i>Time</i>"
at the beginning of a boxing contest.</p>

<p>I would not have been elsewhere for worlds, but at the
same time I wondered what the smack of a bullet felt like,
and how much chance a bayonet stood against the heavy sword
or the lance of a charging Arab....</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it that Sergeant-Major Lejaune
knew his job, and I found myself wishing that he were not
such a wholly hateful person.</p>

<p>I should have liked to admire him as much as I admired
his military skill, and ability as a commander, and I began
to understand how soldiers love a good leader when it is
possible to do so.</p>

<p>One felt that nobody could have handled the situation
with more grasp and certainty than he did, and that if any
kind of catastrophe or disaster ensued, it would be owing
to no fault in the ability, courage, and promptitude of
Sergeant-Major Lejaune.</p>

<p>To watch him conducting operations that day, was to
watch a highly skilled artisan using his tools with the
deftness and certainty of genius.</p>

<p>On a low, flat-topped rocky hill, we halted and rested,
all except Lejaune himself and the scouts whom he sent to
various distant sand-hills and low rocky eminences which,
while visible from the detachment, gave a wide range of
vision in the supposed direction of the enemy.</p>

<p>Among others set to similar tasks, I was ordered to
watch one particular man and to report any movement on
his part. I watched the tiny distant figure through the
shimmering heat haze, which danced over the sand and
stones, until my eyes ached and I was forced, from time to
time, to close them and cover them with my hand.</p>

<p>Upon opening them after one of these brief rests, which
were absolutely necessary, I saw that he was crawling back
from his position. When below the skyline, he rose and ran,
stooping for a short distance. He then halted and signalled
"<i>Enemy in sight.</i>"</p>

<p>The moment that I had pointed him out to Corporal
Boldini, Lejaune was notified, and he sent a man named
Rastignac running to an eminence, well to our left rear,
and a minute later we were lining the edge of our plateau
on the side to which this man had disappeared.</p>

<p>Here we lay concealed, and waited.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the man who had been sent off,
fired a shot and exposed himself on the highest point of
his rocky hillock.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I saw our scouts retiring and
running&mdash;not back to us, but to him; and, a minute
or two later, I saw a flutter of white on a distant
sand-hill.</p>

<p>Rallying on the man who was firing from the top of the
rock, the scouts opened fire at distant camel-mounted
figures who began to appear over the sand-hills. We
received no orders, save to the effect that we should lie
as flat and still as the hot stones that concealed us.</p>

<p>Between two of these I watched the scattered fringe
of Arabs increase to lines, and the lines to masses of
swiftly-moving camel-riders, and soon their deep menacing
cry of "<i>Ul-ul-ul-ul-ul-ullah Akbar,</i>" came to our ears
like the growing roar of an advancing sea.</p>

<p>As they came on, the little party of our scouts fired
rapidly, and after about the thousand-yard range, a camel
would occasionally sprawl headlong to the ground, or a
white-clad figure fall like a sack and lie motionless on
the sand.</p>

<p>On swept the Arab <i>harka</i> at the top pace of their swift
camels, the men in front firing from the saddle, the others
brandishing their long, straight swords and waving their
lances aloft.</p>

<p>Rapidly and steadily the little band of scouts fired
into the brown of them, and, by now, every bullet was
hitting man or beast in the closely-packed irregular ranks
of the swiftly-advancing horde.</p>

<p>It was thrilling. I felt I must get a grip upon myself,
or I should be shaking with excitement, and unable to shoot
steadily when our turn came to take part in the fight.</p>

<p>And then, to my amazement, I saw that our scouts were
retreating. One by one, they sprang up from behind rocks
and fled to their right rear, each man dropping and firing
as his neighbour rose to retreat in his turn. Before
long, the little band was again in position, nearer to us
and still further behind us. With increased yells, the
Arabs swerved to their left and bore down upon them, men
and camels falling beneath the magazine-fire of their
rifles.</p>

<p>I could scarcely keep still. How long was this unequal
fight to continue? None of the scouts had been hit by the
wild fire of the camel-riders, but in a couple of minutes
they would be overwhelmed by this wave of mounted men, and,
outnumbered by fifty to one, would have as much chance as
has a fox beneath a pack of hounds.</p>

<p>And as I held my breath, the tiny handful again rose to
their feet, turned their backs upon the Arabs, and fled as
one man toward a sand-hill in our rear. With a simultaneous
yell of mingled execration and triumph, the Arab <i>harka</i>
swerved again, seemed to redouble their speed, and bore
down upon their prey.</p>

<p>And then, Sergeant-Major Lejaune stood up on a rock,
gave a crisp order, coolly as on parade, and, at less than
fifty yards, the Arab masses received the withering blast
of our magazine-fire.</p>

<p>Swiftly as our hands could move the bolts of our rifles
and our fingers press the trigger, we fired and fired again
into the surging, shrieking, struggling mob, that halted,
charged, retired, and then fled, leaving quite half their
number behind.</p>

<p>But of those who were left behind, by no means all were
killed or even wounded, and our orgy of slaughter rapidly
turned to a desperate hand-to-hand fight with dismounted
and unwounded Arabs, who, knowing they must die, had but
the one idea of gaining Paradise and the remission of sins,
in the slaying of an infidel.</p>

<p>With a shout of "<i>Baïonnettes au canon,</i>" Lejaune had
us to our feet, and launched us in a fierce bayonet-charge
down the slope of our plateau upon the Arab swordsmen, who
were rallying to the attack, on foot. Our disciplined rush
swept them back, they broke and fled, and, still keeping
us in hand, Lejaune quickly had a double rank of kneeling
and standing men shooting down the fleeing or still defiant
foot-men, and making practice at the remains of the mounted
<i>harka</i> disappearing over the skyline.</p>

<p>Within half an hour of the first signalling of the
approach of the enemy, the only Arabs in sight were those
that lay singly and in little bloodstained heaps, in the
shallow valley into which they had been decoyed by our
scouts.</p>

<p>It was a neat little action, reflecting the highest
credit on Lejaune and on the man who was the senior in
charge of the scouts. The latter, one Gontran, was promoted
corporal, in orders next day, and Sergeant-Major Lejaune
made <i>adjudant.</i></p>

<p>The Arabs must have lost over a hundred men in this
fight, as against our three killed and five wounded.</p>

<p>Such was my first experience of war, my first "smelling
of powder" and my blooding. I had killed a man with cold
steel and I think at least three with my rifle.</p>

<p>Reflecting on this I was glad to remember that these
Touaregs are human wolves, professional murderers, whose
livelihood is robbery with violence, which commonly takes
the form of indescribable and unmentionable tortures.</p>

<p>Nor is the <i>Roumi,</i> the infidel dog, the favourite
object of their treacherous attack, save in so far as he
is a more rewarding object of attention. They are as much
the scourge and terror of the Arab villager, the nomad
herdsman, or the defenceless negro, as they are of the
wealthy caravan or their peaceful co-religionists of the
town, the <i>douar,</i> and the oasis.</p>

<p>The man whom I had killed with my bayonet, had made it
necessary to my continued existence, for he rushed at me
with a great, heavy, straight-bladed sword, exactly like
those used by our Crusaders of old.</p>

<p>Whirling this round his head, he aimed a blow at me that
would have split my skull had I not promptly side-stepped,
drawing back my bayonet as I did so. As the sword missed my
head, I drove at his chest with all my strength, and the
curved hilt of my Lebel bayonet touched his breast-bone as
he fell staggering back, nearly pulling the rifle out of my
hands.</p>

<p>I found afterwards that Digby had had his coat torn
under the armpit by a spear, which, as he remarked, was
not fair wear, but tear, on a good coat. He had shot his
assailant at a range which he estimated as being a good
half-inch, and he was troubled with doubts as to whether
this would be considered quite sporting in the best Arab
circles.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "the bird wasn't actually
'sitting'&mdash;though he's sitting now...."</p>

<p>Michael, being particularly good with the bayonet,
and a noted winner of bayonet <i>v.</i> bayonet competitions,
had used the butt of his rifle in the mêlée, and seemed
to think it unfair of the Arab to wear a turban, that
diminishes the neat effectiveness of this form of fighting!
However, neither of them was hurt, nor were any of our more
immediate friends.</p>

<p>Having buried our dead and obliterated their graves,
we retired slowly toward El Rasa, weary to death
and thoroughly pleased with ourselves, to make our
report....</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">The pitched battle of El Rasa was
fought next day, our battalion holding the oasis against
tremendous odds until supports came from the brigade, and
the Arabs learnt what quick-firing little mule-guns can
do, when given such a target as a huge mob of horse and
camel-men advancing <i>en masse</i> over a level plain.</p>

<p>As my part in this battle was confined to lying behind
the bole of a palm-tree and shooting whenever I had
something to shoot at, I have no adventures to relate. I
might as well have spent the day on a rifle-range.</p>

<p>But I saw a magnificent charge of a couple of squadrons
of Spahis upon a vastly superior number of Arab cavalry,
which, shaken by artillery fire, appeared to be hanging in
doubt as to whether to make one of their fierce rushes,
overwhelming and desperate, upon the infantry lining the
edge of the oasis. It was a thrilling and unforgettable
sight....</p>

<p>After the signal victory of El Rasa, the brigade moved
on southward and we preceded it, the weeks that followed
being a nightmare of marching that ended in the worse
nightmare of garrison duty in the ultimate, furthermost,
desert outpost of Zinderneuf, where we had the initial
misfortune of losing Digby and many of our friends,
including Hank and Buddy.</p>

<p>They departed to the mounted-infantry school at
Tanout-Azzal, where the gentle art of mule-handling was
taught, and the speed of the swift-marching legionary
increased by mounting him on a mule. A company of such men
was thus rendered as mobile as a squadron.</p>

<p>It was a cruel blow to Michael and me, this separation
from our brother and from those best of friends, Hank and
Buddy.</p>

<p>However, we were certain to be reunited sooner or later,
and there was nothing to do but to make the best of this
and the other drawbacks and miseries of Zinderneuf.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch205" id="ch205">V. &mdash; THE FORT AT
ZINDERNEUF</a></h2>

<p class="poem">"They learn that they are not as
others are,<br> Till some go mad, and some sink prone
to earth,<br> And some push stumbling on without a
star."</p><br>

<p class="first">THINGS began badly and rapidly grew worse
in this ill-omened mud fort, isolated in the illimitable
desert like a tiny island in the midst of a vast ocean.</p>

<p><i>Cafard</i> broke out early, and in a very virulent form,
both suicidal and homicidal in its nature.</p>

<p>It took this terrible form, I verily believe, largely
by reason of the fact that Captain Renouf, our Commandant,
shot himself after a month of life in this dreadful oven
of a place. I do not, of course, know his reason for doing
this, but it was rumoured that he found he had contracted a
horrible disease. This tragedy cast a deeper gloom over a
place and a community already gloomy beyond description.</p>

<p>Within a week of this disaster, for a disaster it was
to all of us, a most unusual manifestation of <i>cafard</i>
was exhibited, when a corporal killed a sergeant and then
committed suicide. What Corporal Gontran's grievance
against the sergeant was, I do not know, but this again was
an exceedingly unfortunate affair, as, like Captain Renouf
himself, both these men were on the side of the angels,
inasmuch as they were decent, fair-minded, and reasonable
people.</p>

<p>But the Fates and the Furies had one more disaster in
store for the unhappy garrison before they were ready
to launch upon our luckless heads the final torrent of
destruction.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Debussy, the new Commandant, sickened and
died, and his place was taken by none other than Adjudant
Lejaune.</p>

<p>From the moment in which it was known that the
Lieutenant was dead, the atmosphere of Zinderneuf changed
from bad to worse and rapidly from worse to the worst
possible.</p>

<p>The lion-tamer had entered the cage, and the lions,
sullen, infuriated, and desperate, knew that he held in one
hand the whip that should drive them to revolt, and in the
other the revolver that should instantly punish the first
sign of it.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">Life at Zinderneuf was not really life so
much as the avoidance of death&mdash; death from sunstroke,
heat-stroke, monotony, madness, or Adjudant Lejaune.</p>

<p><i>Cafard</i> was rampant; everybody was more or less
abnormal and "queer" from frayed nerves, resultant upon the
terrific heat and the monotony, hardship, and confinement
to a little mud oven of a fort; many men were a little mad,
and Adjudant Lejaune, in the hollow of whose hand were our
lives and destinies, was a great deal more than a little
mad.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the authorities, he was sane
enough, for he could maintain an iron discipline; make all
reports and returns, to the minute and to the letter; and,
if attacked, he could be trusted to keep the Tri-couleur
flying while there was a man alive in the Fort.</p>

<p>From the point of view of his subordinates, he was
nevertheless a madman, and a very dangerous one.</p>

<p>At times, I was almost glad that Digby was not with us,
much as I missed him; and at those times I almost wished
that Michael was not, much as I depended on him.</p>

<p>Danger to oneself is unpleasant enough, when it is that
of being murdered by a lunatic. When to it is added the
danger, and constant fear, of a similar fate overtaking
people whom one loves, it becomes ten times worse.</p>

<p>Michael and I both begged each other not to be so
foolish as to play into Lejaune's hands, by giving him
the faintest chance to accuse us of any breach of duty or
discipline, or of so much as an insubordinate look, even
under the greatest provocation. But we felt that the time
would come when Lejaune would cease to wait for an excuse,
and that all we could do was to put off the evil day....</p>

<p>"I'm positively glad, now, that Dig isn't here," said
Michael to me, one terrible afternoon, as we lay gasping
on our burning cots during siesta hours, in our stifling
<i>caserne.</i></p>

<p>"Hank and Buddy too," he added. "One word of back-chat
to Lejaune would have been fatal.... And Dig might have
done it. Buddy more so.... Or if Hank once lost control
he'd lay Lejaune out like a pole-axed ox...."</p>

<p>"Somebody'll do for him one of these days, if we don't
soon get a new commanding officer," said I. "And a good job
too."</p>

<p>"Not it," contradicted Michael. "It would be one degree
worse than letting him live.... These asses would give
three loud cheers, march off into the desert, and survive
about three days of it&mdash;if the Arabs didn't get them
before they died of thirst."</p>

<p>"It'll happen," prophesied I. "Schwartz is getting very
mysterious and important these days. Oh, it'll happen all
right."</p>

<p>"That's what I think," said Michael, "and it's about
the worst thing that <i>could</i> happen. And if no one goes
and does it spontaneously, there'll be a plot to murder
him&mdash;if there isn't one already, which I believe there
is, as you say&mdash;and we should have the choice of
fighting for Lejaune&mdash;(for <i>Lejaune!)</i>&mdash;or being
two of a gang of silly, murdering mutineers with nothing
but a choice of beastly deaths&mdash;thirst and Arabs in
the desert, or court martial and a firing party at dawn....
Rotten."</p>

<p>"If he's promoted Lieutenant and kept in command here,
he won't last a week," said I.... "What's going to happen
if they make a plot to mutiny and we're the only two that
refuse to join them?"</p>

<p>"We should join Lejaune instead, where dead men tell no
tales, I expect," answered Michael.</p>

<p>"What would Sergeant Dupré and Corporal Boldini do?" I
speculated.</p>

<p>"If it were a case of saving their skins they'd join
the mutineers, I should say&mdash;if they were given the
option," replied Michael. "They probably loathe Lejaune as
much as we do, and neither of them is exactly the man to
die for a principle.... If they woke to find a gang of bad
men, with rifles, round their beds, they'd '<i>take the cash
and let the discredit go,</i>'&mdash; '<i>Nor heed the rumble of
a distant drum</i>' from Tokotu," he added.</p>

<p>"I doubt if they'd be given the option," I said.</p>

<p>"So do I," agreed Michael. "They're not loved. They've
been whips and scorpions in Lejaune's hands too long and
too willingly."</p>

<p>"And if we were 'approached' on the subject of a mutiny
and did our miserable duty in warning Lejaune and the
others?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We should promptly get thirty days' cells from
Lejaune for currying favour with horrible lies, and short
shrift from the mutineers for being <i>escrocs,</i>" said
Michael....</p>

<p>"Let us give thanks unto the Lord and count our many
blessings, my brethren," he yawned, and, at that moment,
Schwartz, Haff, Brandt, Bolidar, Delarey, and Vogué entered
the room and joined Guantaio, Colonna, and Gotto at the
other end of it. Here they conversed in low voices, with
occasional glances at us.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">And to me, one night, came Schwartz, as I
sat in a corner of the little courtyard, trying to imagine
that the night was cooler than the day, and this spot,
which faced north, less hot than the others.</p>

<p>He was a huge, powerful, hairy ruffian, who would have
made a great pirate-captain, for he had brains, courage,
and determination, quite unhampered by over-fine scruples
of honour or mercy. He was further endowed with a magnetic
personality and power of command.</p>

<p>"Are you enjoying life, Smith?" he asked, seating
himself beside me.</p>

<p>"Quite as much as you are, Schwartz," I replied.</p>

<p>"Would you like a change?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"I am fond of change," said I.</p>

<p>A brief silence ensued.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a pig die?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, you soon will," he assured me.</p>

<p>"Feeling ill?" I enquired rudely. I did not like the
gross Schwartz.</p>

<p>"You are going to see a big pig die," he went on,
ignoring my vulgarity. "A sacred pig. An anointed pig. A
striped pig. A promoted pig. Oh, an <i>adjudant</i> pig."</p>

<p>"So?" I murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes. <i>Monsieur le Cochon</i> is going to become <i>Monsieur
Porc.</i>"</p>

<p>"And are you going to become <i>Monsieur Charcutier,</i>
'Mr. Pork-butcher,' so to speak?" I enquired. There could
be no harm in knowing all there was to know about this
business.</p>

<p>"Aha! my friend," growled the German, "that remains to
be seen. So many want a <i>côtelette de porc</i> or a <i>savouret
de porc.</i> We shall have to cast lots."</p>

<p>He was silent for a minute and sat beside me, gnawing
his knuckles. He was shaking from head to foot with fever,
excitement, or diseased nerves.</p>

<p>"Do you want a chance to be <i>charcutier?</i>" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have had no experience of pig-killing," I
answered.</p>

<p>"Look you," he growled, seizing my arm, "you will have
the experience shortly, <i>either as pig or as butcher,</i> for
all here will be <i>cochon</i> or <i>charcutier</i>&mdash;in a day or
two. See? Choose whether you will be a pig or a butcher....
And tell your brother to choose.... Meantime, if any man
comes to you and says '<i>porc,</i>' you reply '<i>cochon.</i>' Then
he will know that I have spoken to you, and you will know
that he is one of us. See? And you and your brother make
up your minds quickly. We don't care either way. There
are enough of us&mdash;oh, enough...." And as somebody
approached, he got up and slouched off.</p>

<p>That night I told Michael what I had heard.</p>

<p>The next day it was Guantaio. I was sitting in the same
place and he crept towards me purposefully.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" he asked, and, hearing my name, came and
sat down beside me, as Schwartz had done.</p>

<p>"It's hot," he said, removing his <i>képi</i> and puffing.</p>

<p>"It is," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of hot... <i>porc?</i>" he enquired.</p>

<p>"<i>Cochon!</i>" said I playfully.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he replied at once. "What do you think of it
all?"</p>

<p>"I never think," said I.</p>

<p>This silenced him for a minute.</p>

<p>"They are ten to one," he said suddenly. "Ten butchers
to a pig. What chance has the big pig and one or two
biggish pigs against a score of butchers?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said imitatively. "What do you think of it
all?"</p>

<p>"I never think," said Guantaio, with a malevolent smile.
I yawned and stretched and affected to settle myself to
slumber.</p>

<p>"How would you and your brother like to be <i>pigs</i> if I
could find two or three other pigs to join the big pig, and
the one or two biggish pigs?" he enquired, nudging me.</p>

<p>I belied my statement that I never thought, and did some
rapid thinking.</p>

<p>Had it been arranged that he should sound me as soon as
Schwartz had hinted at the assassination of Lejaune? Was it
his task to find out whether my name was to be put on the
"butcher" list or on the "pig" list? Were all those who did
not wholeheartedly join the "butchers" to be shot in their
beds on the night of the mutiny?</p>

<p>Or, again, was the rogue trying to find out which was
likely to be the stronger party, and did he intend to
betray his friends to the non-commissioned officers, if he
thought them likely to win?</p>

<p>"How should we like to become <i>pigs,</i> you
say?" I temporised.... "I should hate to be
butchered&mdash;shouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Very much," he replied.... "But do you know," he went
on, "I have heard of pigs attacking men. <i>Taking them
unawares</i> and eating them up...."</p>

<p>"I should hate to be eaten up by a pig&mdash;shouldn't
you?" I observed.</p>

<p>"Very much," he agreed again. "One does not want to be
slaughtered by butchers nor eaten by pigs."</p>

<p>"No," said I. "Need either happen?"</p>

<p>"Not if one is a wise pig&mdash;forewarned and
forearmed&mdash;who attacks the butchers, <i>taking them
unawares,</i>" he replied.</p>

<p>"Has the big pig got his eye on the butchers?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Guantaio. "Nor have the biggish pigs."</p>

<p>"And are you going to open the eyes of the blind pigs?"
I enquired.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Guantaio. And I had a very
strong conviction that he was speaking the truth, for there
was a ring of genuine doubt and puzzlement in his voice. At
any rate, if he were lying when he said it, he was lying
extraordinarily well.</p>

<p>No&mdash;he did not know what to do, I decided, and he
was simply trying to find out where his private interests
lay. Would it pay him better to stand in with his friends,
and assist in the mutiny and the murder of Lejaune and
the non-commissioned officers? Or would he do better for
himself if he betrayed his friends, warned his superiors,
and assisted them to defeat the mutineers?</p>

<p>That he was one of the ringleaders of the plot was
obvious, since he was the bosom friend of Colonna, Gotto,
Vogué, and the rest of Schwartz's band, and had always
been one of the circle in their recent confabulations and
mutterings together.</p>

<p>I followed the excellent, if difficult, plan of trying
to put myself in Guantaio's place, and to think with his
mind.</p>

<p>On the one hand, if I were Guantaio, I should see the
great dangers attendant on the mutiny. It might fail, and
if it succeeded, it could only be the prelude to a terrible
march into the desert&mdash;a march of doomed men, hunted
by the Arabs and by the French alike, and certain to die of
thirst and starvation if not killed by enemies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I were the excellent Guantaio, I
should see the advantages attendant upon playing the part
of the saviour of the situation. Reward and promotion were
certain for the man who saved the lives of his superiors
and the honour of the flag, and who preserved the Fort of
Zinderneuf for France. And, of course, it would be the
simplest thing in the world for Lejaune, Dupré, Boldini,
Guantaio, and a few loyal supporters to defeat the
conspirators and secure the mutineers. It would only be a
matter of entering the barrack-room at night, seizing the
arms, and covering the suspects with the rifles of the
loyalists, while the guard arrested them. Anyone resisting,
could be shot as soon as he raised a hand.</p>

<p>Lejaune alone could do the business with his revolver,
if he entered the room while all were asleep, and shot any
man who did not instantly obey any order that he gave.</p>

<p>In fact, I began to wonder why Guantaio should be
hesitating like this. Surely it was to his interest to
betray his friends?</p>

<p>Certainly he would not allow any ridiculous scruples
to hinder him from committing any treacherous villainy,
and certainly it was far less dangerous, in the long run,
to be on the side of authority&mdash;for the mutineers'
real danger only <i>began</i> with the mutiny, and it steadily
increased from the moment when they set forth into the
desert to escape.</p>

<p>More and more I wondered at his hesitation.</p>

<p>And then a light began to dawn upon my brain. This
Guantaio was the henchman of his compatriot, Corporal
Boldini. Boldini might be killed when the mutineers killed
Lejaune; for hate and vengeance were the mainsprings of the
plot, and Boldini was hated second only to Lejaune himself.
He might not be given the option of joining the mutineers
when Lejaune was murdered. Suppose the Italians, Boldini,
Guantaio, Colonna, and Gotto, were a united party, led
by Boldini, with some sinister end of their own in view?
And might not Guantaio be doubtful as to whether the rôle
allotted to him were not too much that of the cat's-paw?</p>

<p>Suppose the Boldini party intended to fish in troubled
waters&mdash;for a pearl of great price? In other words,
suppose they hoped to do what they had certainly tried,
and failed, to do in Sidi-bel-Abbès, when they had induced
Bolidar to attempt to rob my brother?</p>

<p>Most undoubtedly these rogues believed Boldini's story
that we were a gang of jewel-thieves and that Michael
carried about with him a priceless gem&mdash; to which
they had at least as much right as he had. No&mdash;I
decided&mdash;Guantaio spoke the truth when he said he did
not know what to do. He was a knave all through. He would
betray anybody and everybody. He was afraid that his share
in the mutiny would be death, whether it failed or not, and
what he really wanted to do was to follow the course most
likely to lead him to the possession of two things&mdash;a
whole skin and a share in the jewel&mdash;unless indeed he
could get the jewel itself.</p>

<p>"It's a difficult problem, my friend," mused I
sententiously. "One does not know which side to take....
One would like to be a pig, if the pigs are going to catch
the butchers napping.... On the other hand, one would like
to be a <i>charcutier,</i> if the butchers are going to act
first...."</p>

<p>We sat silent awhile, the excellent Guantaio making a
perfect meal of his nails.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;that is a point!" I went on. "When <i>are</i> the
butchers going to kill?"</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur le Grand Charcutier</i>" (by whom, I supposed,
he meant Schwartz) "talks of waiting till full moon," was
the reply. "If a new Commandant has not come by then, or
if <i>Monsieur le Grand Cochon</i> has been promoted and given
command before then, it would be a good date.... Do it at
night and have full moon for a long march.... Rest in the
heat of the day, and then another big moonlight march, and
so on...."</p>

<p>"So one has three or four days in which to make up one's
mind?" I observed.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Guantaio. "But I don't advise your
waiting three or four days before doing it.... Schwartz
will want to know in good time.... So as to arrange some
butchers for each pig, you see...."</p>

<p>"And what about Lejaune?" I asked, since we were to use
names and not fantastic titles. "Suppose somebody warned
him? What then?"</p>

<p>"Who <i>would?</i>" asked Guantaio. "Who loves that mad dog
enough to be crucified, and have his throat cut, on his
behalf? Why <i>should</i> anyone warn him? Wouldn't his death be
a benefaction and a blessing to all?"</p>

<p>"Not if things went wrong," I replied. "Nor if it ended
in our all dying in the desert."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Guantaio, gnawing away at his nails. "No...
I hate the desert... I fear it... I fear it...."</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;that was the truth of the matter. He feared
being involved in a successful mutiny almost as much as in
an unsuccessful one.</p>

<p>"Suppose, <i>par exemple,</i> I went and warned Lejaune?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Huh! He'd give you sixty days' <i>cellule,</i> and
take damned good care you never came out alive,"
replied Guantaio, "and he would know what he knows
already&mdash;that everybody hates him and would be
delighted to kill him, given a good opportunity.... And
what would your comrades do to you?"</p>

<p>He laughed most unpleasantly.</p>

<p>No&mdash;I decided&mdash;friend Guantaio would not like
me to warn Lejaune. If Lejaune were to be warned, Guantaio
would prefer to do the warning himself.</p>

<p>"How would they know that I was the informer?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Because I should tell them," was the reply. "If Lejaune
gets to know&mdash; then you and nobody else will have told
him."</p>

<p>So that was it? Guantaio could turn informer, having
sworn that I was going to do so! Not only would he save his
own skin, but Michael would soon have a friend and brother
the less, when Schwartz and his merry men heard who had
betrayed them.</p>

<p>"Of course, you and your brother would be held to have
acted together, as you always do," said Guantaio.</p>

<p>So that was it again? Michael and I being denounced to
the mutineers as traitors, Guantaio might well be moved to
murder and rob Michael&mdash;secure in his honourable rôle
of executioner of justice upon a cowardly traitor.</p>

<p>The Legion knew no punishment too severe for infliction
upon any man who acted contrary to the interests of his
comrades. Guantaio need not fear the fate of Bolidar in
such circumstances.</p>

<p>"What would you do if you were me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Join the butchers," was the prompt reply. "You and your
brother must follow Schwartz. Better the enmity of Lejaune
than of half the barrack-room led by Schwartz. Lejaune
couldn't come straight to your bed and murder you, anyhow.
Schwartz could, and would. And he <i>will,</i> unless you join
him...."</p>

<p>Yes, undoubtedly the filthy creature was in grave doubt
about the best course to pursue, and spoke from minute to
minute as new ideas and fresh views occurred to him, and as
his fears and hopes swayed him.</p>

<p>At present he saw the desirability of me and Michael
being mutineers. Just now, he had seen some advantage in
our not being of their party....</p>

<p>Probably the most puzzling and baffling thing to a
tortuous mind is simple truth. It is often the subtlest
diplomacy, when dealing with such people as this. So I
decided to speak the plain truth, and leave him to make
what he could of it.</p>

<p>"I shall talk the matter over with my brother," I
said, "and we will decide to-night. Probably we shall
warn Lejaune. You can tell Schwartz that. And I can give
him a definite answer to-morrow. Then he can do as he
pleases."</p>

<p>"You won't warn Lejaune until you have told Schwartz you
are going to do so, of course?" asked Guantaio, and I had
seen his eyes light up as I announced the probability of
our defying Schwartz. That seemed to suit him finely.</p>

<p>"No, I won't," I assured him. "Neither will my
brother.... Provided, of course, that nothing will be done
to-night? No mutinying, I mean...."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Guantaio. "They're not ready yet. A few
haven't joined. Schwartz would like to get everybody, of
course; but failing that, he wants to know exactly <i>who</i> is
to be killed before they start. It will prevent unfortunate
accidents.... Also they want the full moon...."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I shall decide to-night," I said. "And now
please go away. I want to think&mdash;and also I'm not
extraordinarily fond of you, Guantaio, really...."</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">The first thing to do now was to find
Michael and decide as to what line we were going to
take.</p>

<p>He was on sentry-go, and I must wait.</p>

<p>Meantime, I might find St. André, Maris, Glock, and
one or two others who were fundamentally decent honest
men of brains and character, and less likely than some of
the rest to be driven by blind hatred of Lejaune, or the
dominance of Schwartz, into murderous folly that was also
suicidal.</p>

<p>St. André was lying on his cot in the barrack-room.
He looked at me as I entered. Taking my belt and a
polishing-rag, I strolled in the direction of his bed, and
came to a halt near him, rubbing industriously.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of pork, <i>mon ami?</i>" I enquired softly,
without looking away from my work.</p>

<p>"I am something of a <i>cochon</i> about it," he replied in a
low voice, and added, "Anyhow, I would rather be that than
a butcher."</p>

<p>So he had been approached, too.</p>

<p>"Follow me outside when I go," I said.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he found me in the courtyard, and
I learned that Schwartz had sounded him that day; told
him that he must choose between being a pig or a butcher;
and had given him a couple of days in which to make up
his mind. Schwartz had concluded by informing St. André
that all who were not <i>for</i> him would be treated as being
<i>against</i> him, and that eighty per cent of the men had
willingly taken the oath to follow him and to obey him
absolutely....</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, St. André?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What you and your brother do," was the immediate
reply.</p>

<p>He went on to say that he had thought of nothing else
from the moment he had learnt of the plot, and that he had
come to the conclusion that he would join with Michael and
me, to do what seemed the best thing.</p>

<p>"You see, my friend," he concluded, "one, of course,
cannot join in with these poor madmen&mdash;one has been an
officer and a gentleman. Even if one <i>had</i> sunk low enough
to do such a thing, and one eased one's conscience by
saying that Lejaune deserves death, the fact remains that
these lunatics can but step from the frying-pan into the
fire."</p>

<p>"Exactly," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Here we live&mdash;in hell, I admit&mdash;but we do
<i>live,</i> and we are not here for ever," he went on. "Out
in the desert we shall not live. Those who do not die of
thirst, will die by slow torture under the knives of the
Arab women."</p>

<p>"They will," said I.</p>

<p>"Besides," he continued, "I would not join them if we
could march straight into the service of the Sultan of
Morocco and be welcomed and rewarded with high rank in his
army.... I am a Frenchman and have been an officer and a
gentleman.... I am here through no fault of my own. St.
André is my real name. My brother is a Lieutenant in a
Senegalese battalion.... But you and your brother are not
Frenchmen, and if you could get to Morocco, each of you
could be another Kaid McLean.... But you could not get to
Morocco on foot from here.... You would be hunted like mad
dogs, apart from all question of food and water.... You
could not do it...."</p>

<p>"We are not Frenchmen and we have not been officers,
St. André," I replied; "but we are gentlemen&mdash;and
we do not murder nor join murder-gangs.... And as you
say&mdash;we could not do it and would not if we could."</p>

<p>"No, I knew you would not join them," said St. André,
seizing my hand, "and I told myself I should do just what
you and your brother did."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'll talk it over with him as soon as he
comes off duty, and we will let you know what we decide," I
said, "but certainly it will not be to join them.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," I added, "you get hold of Maris&mdash;he's
a decent good chap, and see what he has got to say. You
might try Glock, Dobroff, Marigny, Blanc, and Cordier, too,
if you get a chance.... They are among the least mad in
this lunatic asylum."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed St. André, "if we can form a party of our
own, we may be able to save the situation," and he went
off.</p>

<p>I waited for Michael, sitting on a native bed, of string
plaited across a wooden frame, that stood by the courtyard
wall near the guard-room.</p>

<p>Seated here in the stifling dark, I listened to the
gibberings, groans, yells, and mad laughter that came from
the <i>cellules,</i> where some of Lejaune's victims were being
driven more and more insane by solitary confinement and
starvation.</p>

<p>When Michael was relieved, I followed him as he went to
the barrack-room to put his rifle in the rack and throw off
his kit.</p>

<p>"I'll be sitting on the <i>angareb,</i>" I said. "More
developments."</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in five minutes," he replied.</p>

<p>When he joined me, I told him what Guantaio had said,
and I added my own views on the situation, together with
those of St. André.</p>

<p>Michael listened in silence.</p>

<p>"Position's this, I think," he said, when I had
finished. "Schwartz and his band of lunatics proposing to
murder Lejaune and anybody who stands by him, Guantaio has
given the show away to Corporal Boldini because he thinks
the mutiny too risky. Boldini wants to join the mutineers
if they're likely to be successful&mdash;but not otherwise.
Probably he, Guantaio, Colonna, Gotto, and Bolidar are in
league to get the mighty 'diamond'&mdash;one way or the
other&mdash;out of this mutiny. If we join the mutineers,
Boldini and Co. will join, too, with the idea of killing me
and robbing me in the desert and getting to Morocco with
the Cullinan-Kohinoor.... Or to put it more truly, Boldini
would get the 'Co.' to do the murdering and stealing, and
then kill or rob whichever of his gang brought it off. If
we refuse to join the mutineers, Boldini's plan would then
be to get Guantaio to murder me in my bed&mdash;ostensibly
for being a traitor to the noble cause of mutiny&mdash;and
pinch the Great Diamond from my belt.... Failing that,
Boldini would use us in helping to suppress the mutiny,
hoping that, in the scrap, I might get done in, and he
could rob my corpse. He could do more than hope it. He
could arrange it...."</p>

<p>"On the other hand," said I, "Boldini may know nothing
whatever about the plot, and Guantaio may be wondering
whether to let the mutiny go on, or whether to warn his old
pal Boldini and give the show away."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed Michael. "We're absolutely in the
dark in dealing with hopeless congenital bred-in-the-bone
liars like Guantaio. We can only go on probabilities, and,
on the whole, the swine seemed to be egging you on to join
the plot.... Well, that means he has some definite personal
interest in our joining it. Obviously if he hadn't, he
wouldn't care a damn whether we joined it or not."</p>

<p>"What's to be done, Beau?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Get together an opposition-gang of non-mutineers,
and then tell Schwartz plainly that we are going to warn
Lejaune and also going to obey Lejaune's orders on the
subject," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said I. "Just about what I told Guantaio....
And St. André will stand in with us, whatever we decide to
do.</p>

<p>"But suppose we can get no one else," I pondered.</p>

<p>"Then we and St. André will warn Lejaune and tell him
he can count on us three to be true to our salt," said
Michael.</p>

<p>"Without warning Schwartz?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Michael. "We can't sneak like
that."</p>

<p>"Of course, Schwartz and Co. will do us in, as
traitors," I observed.</p>

<p>"Probably," agreed Michael. "Try to, anyhow.</p>

<p>"If we can get up a strongish party, Schwartz's lot may
chuck the idea of mutiny," he went on. "If they don't, it
will be a case of who strikes first. We must warn Lejaune
the moment we've made it quite clear to Schwartz that we're
going to do so then and there, unless he gives up the whole
idea.... Whether he gives it up, or not, will depend on the
number we can get to back us."</p>

<p>We sat silent for a minute or two, pondering this
cheerful position.</p>

<p>"Tell you what," he said suddenly, "we'll call a
meeting. The Briton's panacea. To-morrow evening at six,
the other side of the oasis, and we'll invite St. André,
Blanc, Cordier, Marigny, and any other Frenchmen who'd be
likely to follow St. André. Then there's Maris, Dobroff,
Glock, and Ramon, among the foreigners, who might join
us.... I wish to God that Digby, Hank, and Buddy were
here."</p>

<p>"They'd make all the difference," said I.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if that lot will join us, we can probably
turn Schwartz's murder-party into a mere gang of ordinary
deserters, if go they must...."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, St. André, looking for us, came to
where we were sitting.</p>

<p>"I've spoken to Maris," said he, "and he's with you two,
heart and soul. I also sounded Marigny, but he takes the
line that we can't possibly be such curs as to warn the
unspeakable Lejaune and betray our own comrades."</p>

<p>"We can't be such curs as not to do so," said
Michael.</p>

<p>"Precisely what I tried to make him see," replied St.
André. "It's a question of the point of view and of the
degree of mental and moral development.... To us it is
unthinkable that we should stand by and see murder done,
the regiment disgraced, the Flag betrayed, and the fort
imperilled.... We are soldiers of France...."</p>

<p>He stood up and saluted dramatically, but not
self-consciously, in the direction of the flagstaff.</p>

<p>"To Marigny and his kind," he went on, "it is just as
unthinkable that, having been entrusted with a secret by
a comrade, they should betray this secret and thwart and
endanger the friends who have put their faith in them."</p>

<p>"The point of view, as you say," agreed Michael.
"Personally, though, I've not been entrusted with a secret
by a comrade. I have merely had a threatening and impudent
message from a ruffianly blackguard named Schwartz. He
tells me he is going to commit a murder. I reply that he is
not going to commit a murder, and that unless he abandons
the intention, I am going to warn his victim. That seems a
clear issue to me."</p>

<p>"And to me," said St. André.</p>

<p>"I also found Blanc to be much of the same mind as
Marigny," he went on. "Averse from promoting or even
condoning murder, but even more averse from 'betraying' his
comrades.... I've only spoken to those three so far...."</p>

<p>"Well, look here," said Michael. "To-morrow at six,
beyond the oasis. All our friends and all who are not
actually of Schwartz's gang. You get Marigny, Blanc, and
Cordier, and any other Frenchman you think might join us,
and we'll bring Maris, Ramon, Dobroff, and Glock, and
possibly one or two more. They'll come.... They'll come,
because, obviously, it's a life-or-death matter for all of
us. We must try to see that none of Schwartz's gang know
about the meeting, at any rate until it's over&mdash;but if
they do, we can't help it. I suppose we have as much right
to lay plans as they have?"</p>

<p>"It's a good idea," agreed St. André. "I'll be there and
bring whom I can. About six o'clock."</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">Next evening, a handful of the better
sort assembled near the <i>shaduf</i> in the shade of the
palm-grove, out of sight of the fort. Besides Michael,
St. André, Maris, and myself, there were Cordier,
Blanc, Marigny, Ramon, Dobroff, Glock, Vaerren, and
one or two others&mdash;fifteen or sixteen of us
altogether&mdash;enough, as Michael remarked to me, to
control events, provided a united party, with a common
policy, could be formed.</p>

<p>But this proved impossible. Ideas of right and wrong,
honour and dishonour, fair dealing and vile dealing, were
too discrepant and probably tinctured by other thoughts and
motives, such as those of fear, hatred, ennui, vengeance,
and despair.</p>

<p>Michael addressed the meeting first.</p>

<p>"As you all very well know," said he, "there is a
plot to murder Lejaune and the non-coms., to desert and
to abandon the fort. Schwartz is the ringleader and says
that those who do not declare themselves supporters will
be considered as enemies&mdash;and treated as such.
Personally, I do not do things because Schwartz says I
must, nor do I approve of shooting men in their beds.
Supposing I did, I still should disapprove of being led out
into the desert by Schwartz, to die of thirst. Therefore I
am against his plot&mdash;and I invite you all to join with
me and tell Schwartz so. We'll tell him plainly that unless
he gives up this mad scheme of murder and mutiny, we shall
warn Lejaune...."</p>

<p>Here a growl of disapproval from Marigny and Blanc,
and some vigorous head-shaking, interrupted Michael's
speech.</p>

<p>"I swear I will warn Lejaune," put in St. André, "but I
will warn Schwartz first&mdash;and if he likes to drop the
murder part of the scheme, he can do what else he likes.
Any sacred imbecile who wants to die in the desert can go
and do it, but I have nothing to do with mutinies...."</p>

<p>"<i>No treachery!</i>" roared Marigny, a typical old soldier,
grizzled and wrinkled; an honest, brainless, dogged
creature who admired Schwartz and loathed Lejaune.</p>

<p>"Don't bray like that, my good ass," said Michael
turning to him, "and try not to be a bigger fool than
God meant you to. Where is the treachery in our replying
to Schwartz, '<i>Thank you, we do not choose to join
your murder-gang. Moreover, we intend to prevent the
murder&mdash;so drop the idea at once.</i>' Will you kindly
explain how the gentle Schwartz is thus 'betrayed'?"</p>

<p>"I say it <i>is</i> betrayal of comrades&mdash;to tell an
anointed, accursed, nameless-named dog's-tail like Lejaune
that they are plotting against him. Treachery, I say,"
replied Marigny.</p>

<p>Michael sighed patiently.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what are you going to do,
Marigny&mdash;since you must either be against Schwartz or
for him?" asked Maris.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>for</i> him," replied Marigny promptly.</p>

<p>"A slinking, skulking murderer?" asked Michael
contemptuously. "I thought you were a soldier&mdash;of
sorts."</p>

<p>"I'm for Schwartz," said Marigny.</p>

<p>"Then go to him," snapped Michael. "Go on.... Get
out.... We should prefer it&mdash;being neither cowards
afraid of Schwartz, nor creeping murderers."</p>

<p>Marigny flushed, clenched his fists and, with an oath,
put his hand to his bayonet and made as though to spring
at my brother; but he evidently thought better of it as
Michael closed his right hand and regarded the point of
Marigny's chin.</p>

<p>With a snarl of "Dirty traitors!" the old soldier turned
and strode away.</p>

<p>"Anybody else think as he does?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"I can't agree to betraying old Schwartz," said Blanc,
a Marseilles seaman, noisy, jolly, brave, and debonair; a
rotund, black-eyed, bluff Provençal.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;say what you are going to do then," said
Michael sharply: "Join Schwartz's murderers or else join
us."</p>

<p>"I can't join Lejaune's boot-lickers," said Blanc.</p>

<p>"Then join Schwartz's gang of assassins. You may
perhaps be safer there," said Michael, and Blanc departed
grumbling.</p>

<p>"I must join my compatriots, I'm afraid," said Glock.</p>

<p>"You are 'afraid'!" mocked Michael. "You have said it!
It is Schwartz you are afraid of. You needn't be. You'll be
safer outside that gang of murderers."</p>

<p>"I can't betray my compatriots," repeated Glock.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;can you go to them and say&mdash;(what is
the truth)&mdash;'<i>I don't believe in murder and I am
certain this business will end in the deaths of</i> ALL <i>of
us. Drop it or I and my friends will make you.</i>' Can you do
that?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>Big, simple Glock, with his blue eyes and silly face,
could only scratch his head and shuffle awkwardly from one
foot to another.</p>

<p>"They'd kill me," he said.</p>

<p>"They certainly will kill you of thirst, if you let them
lead you out there," argued Michael, with a wave of his arm
to the encompassing desert.</p>

<p>"It seems we've all got to die, either way," said
Glock.</p>

<p>"It's what I am trying to prevent, isn't it, fat-head?"
answered Michael. "If the decent men of this garrison would
act together and tell Schwartz to stop his silly tricks, no
one need die."</p>

<p>"Except those whom <i>Lejaune</i> is killing," said Cordier,
a clever and agreeable Frenchman who had certainly been a
doctor, and whose prescriptions and treatment his comrades
infinitely preferred to those of any army surgeon. "If that
pariah cur of the gutters of Sodom and Gomorrah could be
shot with safety to the rest of us&mdash;I'd do it myself
to-night, and write my name among those of the benefactors
of the human race."</p>

<p>"Oh? Where do <i>you</i> stand then?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"I come in with you and St. André," replied Cordier,
"though I admit my sympathies are wholly with Schwartz.
Still... one's been a gentleman...."</p>

<p>And in the end we found that only Cordier could really
be depended upon to join Michael, St. André, Maris, and
myself as a staunch and reliable party of anti-Schwartz,
pro-duty-and-discipline non-murderers, prepared to tell the
mutineers that they must drop their assassination plot, or
Lejaune would be warned.</p>

<p>One by one, the others went off, some apologetic and
regretful, some blustering, some honestly anxious to
support what they considered Schwartz's brave blow for
their rights, some merely afraid to do what they would have
liked to do.</p>

<p>When we five were at length alone, Michael said, "Well,
I'm afraid we're not going to scare Schwartz off his
scheme."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Cordier. "It looks more as though we are
only going to provide him with some extra labour. More
little pigs...."</p>

<p>"There won't be any pigs if Lejaune acts promptly," said
St. André.</p>

<p>"None," agreed Maris, "and I'm almost tempted to vote
for warning Lejaune <i>before</i> saying anything to Schwartz.
It would give us more chance...."</p>

<p>"No. No. We can't do that," said Cordier. "We must give
old Schwartz a fair show. If he'll cut out the murder items
from his programme, we'll say nothing, of course, and he
can carry on. If he won't, we'll do our duty as decent
folk, and give Lejaune his chance."</p>

<p>"Will he take it?" I asked. "Will he listen?"</p>

<p>"Not to one of us alone," said St. André. "But he'd have
to take notice of a deputation, consisting of the five of
us, all telling the same tale."</p>

<p>"A deputation consisting of ourselves, coming from
ourselves?" smiled Cordier.</p>

<p>"After all, though," asked Maris, "does it matter if he
believes or not? Suppose one of us goes and tells him the
truth&mdash;isn't that enough? If he likes to punish the
man and ignore his warning, that's his affair."</p>

<p>"Quite," agreed Michael. "But it's ours too! We don't
want to be shot in our beds because Lejaune won't listen
to us.... If Schwartz isn't forestalled, every man in this
fort who hasn't joined his gang by the day after to-morrow
will share Lejaune's fate."</p>

<p>"That means us five, Boldini, Dupré, and Lejaune," said
Cordier.</p>

<p>"Unless Boldini is in with them,&mdash;which is quite
likely," put in St. André.</p>

<p>"Yes, seven of us," mused Michael, "even without
Boldini. If Lejaune listens to our tale of woe and acts
promptly, we five and the two non-coms. are a most ample
force for him to work with.... Simply a matter of acting a
night before they do&mdash;and there need be no bloodshed
either."</p>

<p>"Fancy fighting to protect <i>Lejaune!</i>" smiled Cordier.
"Enough to make <i>le bon Dieu</i> giggle."</p>

<p>"We're fighting to protect the Flag," said St. André.
"Lejaune is incidental. We're going to fight a murderous
mutiny&mdash;and another incidental is that we are probably
going to save our own lives thereby...."</p>

<p>"Who'll tell Schwartz?" interrupted Cordier.</p>

<p>"I will," said Michael.</p>

<p>"We all will," said I. "Let us five just go to him
together and warn him. We won't emphasise the fact that we
speak for ourselves only."</p>

<p>"That's it," agreed St. André. "We'll tell Schwartz that
we're a 'deputation' to him&mdash;and do the same when we
go on to interview Lejaune&mdash;if that's necessary."</p>

<p>And so the five of us agreed to go in search of Schwartz
then and there, to tell him that we would take no part in
mutiny and murder, and to warn him that we should report
the matter at once, unless he agreed to abandon the part of
his scheme that included the slaughter of superiors and the
coercion of comrades.</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">As we left the oasis and strolled towards
the fort, we met a man carrying pails, for water. As he
passed, I saw it was the Portuguese, Bolidar, the man who
had been so roughly handled for attempted theft in our
barrack-room at Sidi-bel-Abbès. He had always pretended
that, on that melancholy occasion, he had strayed, under
the influence of liquor, into the wrong room, and that,
when caught, he was merely getting into what he thought was
his own bed!</p>

<p>Warned by Hank and Buddy, however, we, on the other
hand, regarded the gentleman as the miserable tool of
Boldini, who had taken him up when Guantaio, Colonna, and
Gotto had declined to do his stealing for him.</p>

<p>As he passed Michael, he half stopped, winked, made as
though to speak, and then went on. Looking back, I saw that
he had halted, put his pails down, and was staring after
us.</p>

<p>Seeing me turn round, he signalled to me to come to him,
and began walking towards me.</p>

<p>Here was a man with whom a quiet talk might be very
useful, particularly as he had made the first overtures.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to your brother and you," he
whispered. "Privately. I daren't be seen doing it. I am in
Hell&mdash;and yet I am going to Hell. Yes, I am going to
Hell&mdash;and yet I am in Hell now."</p>

<p>He was evidently in a very unbalanced state of mind. He
was trembling, and he looked terribly ill.</p>

<p>"Go into the oasis and wait," said I. "I'll bring my
brother along soon."</p>

<p>"I must hide... I must hide... I must hide," he kept
repeating.</p>

<p>"All right," I agreed. "You hide. I'll stroll along
whistling '<i>Père Bougeaud</i>' when I bring my brother."</p>

<p>"Lejaune will tear my throat out.... He'll eat my
heart.... So will Schwartz.... So will Boldini...."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't feel the second two," I comforted him,
"and you haven't got three hearts.... You tell us all
about it," I added soothingly. "We'll look after you. Pull
yourself together now," for I thought he was going to burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"You won't bring anybody else? You won't tell anybody
else? Not a word?" he begged.</p>

<p>"Not a soul. Not a word," I replied. "You wait for us in
the far clump of palms beyond the well," and I went after
Michael.</p>

<p>As soon as I could speak to him alone, I told him about
Bolidar.</p>

<p>"Good," said Michael. "We'll hear what the merchant's
got to say before we tackle Schwartz. The bold Bolidar
evidently wants to hedge a bit, for some reason.... 'When
rogues fall out.'... Let's go straight back before he
changes what he calls his mind."</p>

<p>Michael ran on and asked St. André and the others to
wait a little while and do nothing until he returned.</p>

<p>We then went back to the oasis, and as we passed near
the well, I whistling "<i>Avez-vous vu la casquette de Père
Bougeaud?</i>" Bolidar joined us, trembling with fear and
fever.</p>

<p>We went and sat down together with a high sand-hill
between us and the oasis.</p>

<p>At first, Bolidar was incoherent and almost
incomprehensible, but soon it was quite clear that the
wretched creature was turning to us as a last hope and
last resort in his extremity of anxiety, suspense, and
terror.</p>

<p>Realising what it was that drove him to unburden himself
to us&mdash;sheer cowardly fear for his own wretched
skin&mdash;we never for one instant doubted the truth of
what he said.</p>

<p>He oozed truth as he did abject funk, from every pore,
and he showed it in every gleam of his bloodshot rolling
yellow eyes, and in every gesticulation of his trembling
dirty yellow hands.</p>

<p>"My friends," he gabbled, "I must confess to you and I
must save you. I can bear it no longer. My conscience....
My rectitude.... My soul.... My sense of gratitude...."</p>

<p>Michael winked at me. We did not value Bolidar's
conscience and gratitude as highly as we did his state
of trembling fright, when estimating his motives for
"confession."...</p>

<p>"On that terrible night when I was so cruelly misjudged
and so cruelly treated, you tried to save me.... Yes,
even though it was you whom I was supposed to be trying
to rob.... An absurd idea, of course..." and he laughed
nervously.</p>

<p>There was no doubting the fact that the gentle dago was
in a rare state of terror. His convulsive swallowings,
drawn yellow features, tremblings and twitchings, clenched
hands and wild eyes, were really distressing.</p>

<p>"Most absurd idea, of course," murmured Michael. "What
is it you want to tell us?"</p>

<p>"Your diamond! Your diamond!" whispered Bolidar
hoarsely, gripping Michael's wrist and staring into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;my diamond. And what about it?" said Michael
gently.</p>

<p>"Lejaune! Lejaune means to get it," he hissed. "And
he'll kill me! He'll kill me! If he doesn't, Schwartz
will.... Or Boldini.... What <i>shall</i> I do? What <i>can</i> I
do?" he screamed.</p>

<p>Michael patted the poor rascal's shoulder.</p>

<p>"There! There! Never mind. No one's going to kill you,"
he soothed him, almost as though he had been a baby. "Now
tell us all about it and we'll see what can be done.... You
join our party and you'll be safe enough."</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> party?" asked Bolidar. "What is <i>your</i> party?
And what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;we are a party all right. The stoutest
fellows in the garrison&mdash;and we're going to <i>warn</i>
Lejaune&mdash;if Schwartz doesn't agree to give up the
murder part of the plot," replied Michael.</p>

<p>"You're going to do <i>what?</i>" asked Bolidar, open-eyed
and open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Going to warn Lejaune," repeated Michael.</p>

<p>Bolidar threw his hands up and shook with mirthless
laughter.</p>

<p>"<i>But he</i> KNOWS!&mdash;<i>He</i> KNOWS! <i>He</i> KNOWS ALL ABOUT
IT, <i>and who's in it&mdash;and when it's to be&mdash;and
every word that's said in the place!</i>" cackled Bolidar in a
kind of broken, hoarse voice.</p>

<p>Michael and I stared at each other aghast.</p>

<p>"Who tells him?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> <i>do,</i>" was the proud reply of this shameless
animal. "And when he has got your diamond, he will kill
me," he snivelled.</p>

<p>I was absolutely staggered. If Lejaune knew all about
it, what of our precious threat to Schwartz? And what was
our position now?</p>

<p>"Why doesn't Lejaune do something then?" asked
Michael.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll <i>do</i> something all right," said Bolidar.
"He'll do a good deal, the night before Schwartz and his
fools intend to strike."</p>

<p>"Why does he wait?" we asked simultaneously.</p>

<p>"To see what you two are going to do," was the reply.
"If you join Schwartz you'll be killed <i>with</i> Schwartz, the
night before the mutiny is due&mdash;and I'm to secure the
diamond. It is not really supposed that you'll join him
though. And if you don't join Schwartz you are to be killed
in the attack <i>on</i> him instead."</p>

<p>"By whom?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"<i>By me,</i>" replied Bolidar. "You see, if you should
join Schwartz, I am to be loyal and enter the barrack-room
with Lejaune and the others on the night. As we cover the
mutineers with our rifles, mine is to go off and kill
you.... If you don't join Schwartz, I am to be a mutineer,
and when <i>you</i> enter the barrack-room with Lejaune and
the loyal party, in the night, I am to shoot you from my
bed.... Either way you are to die&mdash;and I am perfectly
sure that I shall die too.... Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, Holy Virgin! Oh, Saints in Heaven!" he blubbered.</p>

<p>"And suppose I refuse to give Schwartz any answer, and
remain perfectly neutral?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"Then I am to harangue the mutineers and urge them to
kill you as a non-supporter! You <i>and</i> any others that
won't join them, so that it will not look as though I
have any personal motive or feeling with regard to you
specially. Then I am to offer to 'execute' you.... Having
done it, I am to get the diamond and give it to Lejaune....
Yes," he added with another whispering gasp, "Lejaune is
going to shoot me if you are killed without my securing
the jewel for him..." and he rocked his body to and fro in
despair.</p>

<p>"He ought to have an apron to throw over his head and
cry into&mdash;like an old peasant woman whose cow has
died," said Michael in English.</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed. "Let's get all we can out of the brute
before we let him go."</p>

<p>"Is Boldini in this?" Michael asked Bolidar. "I mean,
are he and Lejaune working together?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Boldini knows that Lejaune knows," was the
reply. "And those two are going to use Dupré and St. André
and Cordier and Maris and you two, for the arrest of the
unarmed mutineers in the middle of the night. That is, if
you refuse to join Schwartz as they anticipate.... But
I doubt if Boldini and Lejaune quite trust each other.
Guantaio says they don't. He thinks that Boldini intends to
get the diamond for himself, and that Lejaune suspects as
much. At least that is what Guantaio tells me&mdash;but I
don't wholly trust him...."</p>

<p>"Don't you really?" said Michael.</p>

<p>"No. I don't think he's absolutely honest," said Bolidar
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"You surprise me," admitted Michael. "The dirty dog!"</p>

<p>"He has made proposals to me which I have rejected with
contempt," said Bolidar.</p>

<p>"Dangerous?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"Absurdly," replied Bolidar. "Besides, how was I to
know that I should get my share? It's bad enough to <i>have</i>
to trust Lejaune as one is compelled to do&mdash;without
risking things with a rascal like Guantaio."</p>

<p>"Has Boldini made&mdash;er&mdash;proposals which you
rejected with contempt?" Michael enquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But as I pointed out to him&mdash;Lejaune is
<i>adjudant</i> while Boldini is only <i>caporal.</i>"</p>

<p>"And what did he say to that?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"That a live <i>caporal</i> is better than a dead
<i>adjudant,</i>" was the interesting reply.</p>

<p>"Sounds sinister," I observed in English.</p>

<p>"Nice little crowd," said Michael in the same language.
"One really doesn't know where one is, nor where to start
on the job of making head or tail of the business.</p>

<p>"Let's get this clear now," he said to Bolidar. "You are
Lejaune's&mdash;er&mdash; man. You warned him of Schwartz's
plot to mutiny and kill him, while acting as though you
were a ringleader. You have told every detail to Lejaune
and kept him up to date with every development. Lejaune has
given you the job of killing me. If I join Schwartz, you
are to turn loyal, go over to Lejaune, and shoot me in my
bed when we are arrested.</p>

<p>"If I refuse to join Schwartz you are to continue as a
mutineer and shoot me, from your bed, when I come in with
the loyal party to arrest you.</p>

<p>"If I decline to declare myself you are to be my
executioner, self-appointed, on behalf of the worthy
mutineers&mdash;who will have no neutrals about. And all
this in order that Lejaune may get a diamond that is
supposed to be in my possession...."</p>

<p>Bolidar was sunk in a lethargy of miserable thought. He
slowly nodded in affirmation.</p>

<p>"And probably Boldini has a plan of his own
which involves a dead <i>adjudant</i> and leaves a live
<i>caporal</i>&mdash;also in pursuit of a diamond! And Boldini's
plan, I suppose, is to support Lejaune until he has got
the diamond, and then withdraw the support&mdash;and the
diamond?..."</p>

<p>Bolidar came out of his fit of brooding abstraction.</p>

<p>"That is what Guantaio said," he replied. "He wanted me
to join Boldini, Colonna, Gotto, and himself. We were to
plot, and kill Lejaune <i>and</i> those who stood by him against
the mutineers, after those poor fools had been arrested
and either shot (in 'self-defence,' of course) or put in
the cells. When we had got the diamond we could decide
whether to liberate the mutineers and use them in fighting
our way to Morocco, or whether their mouths had better
be closed.... We could set fire to the fort and clear
out&mdash;and everything would be put down to the account
of the Arabs...."</p>

<p>"And why did you not fall in with this pretty scheme!"
asked Michael.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;who could trust Boldini? Or Guantaio? Or
any of them, for that matter? They are not <i>honest</i> men.
Once Boldini had the diamond, what would be the worth of
the life of the man who had a claim on a share of it? To
have the diamond would, of course, be death! To be one of
a syndicate owning it would, of course, be death! Even
to know who had got it would be death, for the man who
had it would kill you lest you robbed him or demanded
your share.... How <i>can</i> one work with such dishonest
people?" and the speaker's voice broke with righteous
indignation.</p>

<p>"And has Guantaio made any other proposals which you
have rejected with contempt?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;any number," replied Bolidar. "He seems to
think I'm a fool. He actually proposed that I should
rob you, and he and I should desert together, before
all this mutiny business takes place. I was almost
tempted&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Quite," said Michael. "It must be a great handicap."</p>

<p>"It is," agreed Bolidar. "And besides," he added, "how
could two men walk across two thousand miles of desert,
apart from the question of <i>goums</i> and the Touaregs?... And
wouldn't Guantaio murder me directly we got to Morocco?"</p>

<p>"Unless you murdered him first," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Bolidar, "but one might leave it too
late..." and he meandered on about the untrustworthiness of
Italians.</p>

<p>"Well, now. Let's get down to business," Michael
interrupted. "What have you told us all this for? What do
you want us to do?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Bolidar, "I felt I must deal with honest men
and I must get away. It is certain death for me. If I get
the diamond I shall be killed for it, or for knowing that
Lejaune has got it. If I don't get it, Lejaune will kill me
for failing him, or else for knowing too much when there is
a court martial about the mutiny...."</p>

<p>"Well?" Michael encouraged him.</p>

<p>"I thought that if I told you two all about it&mdash;the
real truth to honest men&mdash;you would save my life and
your own, and give me a share in the diamond."</p>

<p>"How save our lives?" Michael asked.</p>

<p>"All desert together before the mutiny, and you give me
a third-part share in the diamond when we are safe."</p>

<p>"How do you know we should keep our promise?" asked
Michael.</p>

<p>"Because you are English.... In Brazil, we say, '<i>Word
of an Englishman!</i>' and '<i>Word of an American!</i>' when we
are swearing to keep faith. If you promise, I know you will
perform."</p>

<p>"This is very touching," said Michael. "But suppose I
give you my word that I haven't got a diamond and never
possessed a diamond in my life?"</p>

<p>Bolidar smiled greasily, as at one who must have his
little jest.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Señor!</i>" he murmured, waggling his head and his
hands idiotically.</p>

<p>"One knows of the little parcel in your belt-pouch," he
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, one does, does one?" smiled Michael. "Fancy that
now!"</p>

<p>Silence fell.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;as you just said, two or three people can't
march off into the desert and expect to live for more than
a day or two," observed Michael after a while.</p>

<p>"We might make a party," suggested Bolidar. "It is known
that St. André, Maris, Cordier, and one or two more refuse
to listen to Schwartz's plan to kill Lejaune."</p>

<p>"Nor are they deserters," said Michael.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but when they know that they are to be killed
by the mutineers if they don't join them, or to be killed
by Lejaune if they do&mdash;what then?... Tell them the
truth&mdash;that Lejaune is going to have no survivors
of this mutiny&mdash; whichever side they may be on. No.
He's going to have the diamond and the credit and glory of
suppressing the mutiny and saving the fort single-handed.
He'll teach <i>les légionnaires</i> to mutiny! Their mutiny
shall end in death for the lot of them&mdash;and in wealth
and promotion for Lejaune. He sees himself an officer and a
rich man on the strength of this fine mutiny.... And what
happens to the men who told him about the diamond&mdash;the
men who helped him and risked their lives for him? What, I
ask you?... Death, I tell you. <i>Death! Death! Death!</i>" he
screamed, trembling and slavering like a trapped beast.</p>

<p>"And who <i>did</i> tell him about this wonderful diamond!"
asked Michael.</p>

<p>"Boldini," replied Bolidar. "As soon as he rejoined, he
told him of the gang of famous London jewel-thieves who had
fled from the English police to the Legion. He and Guantaio
and Gotto were to get it and give it to Lejaune, who would
protect them and who would either place it and share with
them, or keep it until they had all served their time.... I
don't know."</p>

<p>"And they put you up to steal it in Sidi, eh?" asked
Michael. "Why you?"</p>

<p>But Bolidar spurned such an unworthy suggestion.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, we're getting away from the point," Michael
interrupted him. "What's to be done? We're certainly not
going to desert. I wonder if one could possibly persuade
the gentle Lejaune that there's no such thing as a diamond
in Zinderneuf?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;pretend you hid it and left it&mdash;at
Sidi-bel-Abbès?" said Bolidar. "That's an idea!..."</p>

<p>Michael laughed.</p>

<p>"Did you leave it at Sidi?" asked Bolidar.</p>

<p>"I most certainly have not got a diamond here," replied
Michael.</p>

<p>"Do you swear it by the name of God? By your faith in
Christ? By your love of the Blessed Virgin? And by your
hope for the intercession of the Holy Saints?" asked
Bolidar.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," replied Michael. "I merely say it. I
have not got a diamond&mdash;'<i>Word of an Englishman.</i>'"</p>

<p>"It's a chance," whispered Bolidar. "Dear Christ! It's
a chance. Oh, lovely Christ, help me!... I'll tell Lejaune
you left it at Sidi."</p>

<p>"Tell him what you like," said Michael.</p>

<p>Bolidar pondered.</p>

<p>"Huh! Anyhow, he'll <i>make sure</i> you haven't got it," he
said darkly, and rose to his feet. "But I'll try it. I'll
try it. There is a small hope.... I'll tell you what he
says," he added.</p>

<p>"You'll tell us <i>something,</i> I've no doubt," replied
Michael, as the heroic Portuguese took up his pails and
slunk off.</p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p class="first">"Well, my son&mdash;a bit involved, what?"
smiled my brother as we were left in solitude.</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> one do?" I asked feebly.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Michael promptly and cheerfully.
"Just await events and do the straight thing. I'm not going
to bunk. And I'm not going to join any beastly conspiracy.
But I think I'm going to 'beat Bolidar to the draw' as Hank
and Buddy would say&mdash;when he tries to cover me with
his rifle."</p>

<p>"In other words, you're going to shoot friend Bolidar
before friend Bolidar shoots you?" I said.</p>

<p>"That's it, my son. If he's cur enough to do a dirty
murder like that, just because Lejaune tells him to, he
must take his little risks," replied Michael.</p>

<p>"And if that happens&mdash;I mean if I see him cover you
and you shoot him&mdash; Lejaune is going with him. It is
as much Lejaune's murder as it is Bolidar's," I said.</p>

<p>"You're going to shoot Lejaune, eh?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"I am," said I, "if Bolidar covers you. Why should he
cover <i>you,</i> in particular, out of a score or so of men,
unless he has been told to shoot you?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we'll tell Bolidar just what's going to
happen, and we'll invite him to tell Lejaune too. It would
be fairer, perhaps," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Golly," I observed. "Won't it make the lad gibber! One
more slayer on his track!"</p>

<p>"Yes," smiled Michael. "Then he'll know that if neither
Lejaune nor Boldini nor Schwartz kills him, <i>I</i> shall. Poor
old Bolidar...."</p>

<p>"What about poor old us?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We're for it, I should say," replied Michael. "Of
course, Lejaune won't believe that this wonderful diamond
they are talking about has been left at Sidi, and he'll
carry on."</p>

<p>"I'm muddled," I groaned. "Let's get it clear now:</p>

<p>"<i>One:</i> We tell Schwartz we won't join his gang, and
that we will warn Lejaune of the plot to murder him..."</p>

<p>"Or shall we tell Schwartz that <i>Lejaune knows all about
it?</i>" Michael interrupted.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, I'd forgotten that," I said. "I suppose we'd
better."</p>

<p>"Then they'll crucify poor old Bolidar for good, this
time," grinned Michael. "Serve him right too. Teach him not
to go about murdering to order...."</p>

<p>"We need not say who told us that Lejaune knows," I
observed.</p>

<p>"And then they <i>will</i> know that you and I are beastly
traitors!" said Michael. "Of course, they will at once
think that we told him ourselves."</p>

<p>"Probably Guantaio has told them that, and done it
himself, meanwhile," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it all&mdash;let's talk about something else,"
groaned Michael. "I'm sick of their silly games."</p>

<p>"Yes, old chap. But it's pretty serious," I said. "Let
me just go over it again:</p>

<p>"<i>One:</i> We tell Schwartz that we won't join his gang.
And that Lejaune knows all about his plot.</p>

<p>"<i>Two:</i> Lejaune acts before Schwartz does, and he raids
the barrack-room the night before the mutiny. We shall
either be in bed as though mutineers, or we shall be
ordered to join the guard of loyal men who are to arrest
the mutineers.</p>

<p>"<i>Three:</i> In either case, Bolidar is to shoot you. But
directly he raises his rifle in your direction, you are
going to shoot him. (You'll have to take your rifle to bed
with you if Lejaune is going to pretend that you are a
mutineer.)</p>

<p>"<i>Four:</i> If I see that Bolidar is out to murder you, I
shall shoot Lejaune myself. (I shall take my rifle to bed
too, if we are left with the mutineers.)</p>

<p>"<i>Five:</i> If..."</p>

<p>"Five: The fat <i>will</i> be in the fire, nicely, then,"
interrupted Michael. "What can we do but bolt into the
desert with the rest, if you kill Lejaune? You'd be the
most badly-wanted of all the badly-wanted mutineers, after
that.... They'd get us too, if they had to turn out a
desert-column of all arms...."</p>

<p>We pondered the delightful situation.</p>

<p>"Besides," Michael went on, "you couldn't do it. Of
course you couldn't. It would be a different thing if
Lejaune were raising a rifle to shoot you, as Bolidar will
be doing to me, if I shoot Bolidar. You couldn't just blow
Lejaune's head off, in cold blood. That is exactly what
Schwartz is going to do.... And what we object to."</p>

<p>And it was so, of course. I might just as well go to
Schwartz and offer to be the butcher.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "suppose I cover Lejaune with my
rifle and tell him I'll blow his head off the moment he
moves&mdash;and then I tell him to..."</p>

<p>"Consider himself under arrest?" jeered Michael. "And
what are you then, but the rankest mutineer of the lot?
Besides, it's quite likely that Lejaune won't be there.
He's brave enough&mdash;but he'd like to survive the show.
In fact, he intends to be the sole survivor, I should
say."</p>

<p>"Looks as though we've simply <i>got</i> to join Schwartz
then," I said.</p>

<p>"Damned if I do," replied Michael. "I'm certainly going
bald-headed for anyone who goes for me, but I'm not going
to join any mutineers, nor commit any murders."</p>

<p>"Nor are you," he added, as I stared glumly out into the
desert.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> to be done then?" I asked once again.</p>

<p>"<i>Nothing,</i> I tell you," repeated Michael. "We've got
to 'jump lively when we do jump,' as Buddy says; but we
can only wait on events and do what's best, as they arise.
Meanwhile, let's hold polite converse with the merry
Schwartz.... Come on."</p>

<p>And we got up and strolled through the starlit darkness
to the Fort.</p>

<p>"I suppose we can take it that Sergeant Dupré knows all
about the plot?" I said, as we passed into the stifling
courtyard.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," replied Michael. "I am inclined to
think Lejaune would try to keep a nice compact 'loyal
party' to deal with the mutineers, and hope they'd be like
the Kilkenny cats, mutually destructive.... Say, Dupré,
Boldini, and five or six <i>légionnaires....</i> Some of whom
would be killed in the scrap.... Of course, one doesn't
know <i>what</i> his plans really are&mdash;except that he
means to get a diamond, a lot of kudos, and a nice little
vengeance on his would-be murderers...."</p>

<p>As we entered the barrack-room, we saw that a
committee-meeting of the "butcher" party was in session.
They stared in hostile fashion at Michael and me as we went
to our cots and got out our cleaning-rags from the little
bags.</p>

<p>I sat down on my bed and began melting wax on to my belt
and pouches, preparatory to <i>astiquage</i> labours.</p>

<p>The conspirators' heads drew together again.</p>

<p>Michael went over to where they were grouped at the end
of the long table.</p>

<p>"Have you come with your answer to a question I asked
you about some <i>cochons?</i>" growled Schwartz, scowling at
him.</p>

<p>"I have come with some news about a <i>cochon,</i> my
friend," replied Michael.</p>

<p>Half a dozen pairs of eyes glared at him, and I strolled
over. So did St. André from his cot. Just then Maris and
Cordier entered, and I beckoned to them.</p>

<p>"He knows <i>all</i> about it," said Michael.</p>

<p>Schwartz sprang to his feet, his eyes blazing, his beard
seeming to bristle, and his teeth gleaming as he bared
them. He was a dangerous savage-looking ruffian.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> have told him!" he shouted, pointing in Michael's
face. "You treacherous filthy cur, you have betrayed us!"
and he glanced to where a bayonet hung at the head of his
bed.</p>

<p>"And come straight here and told you?" sneered Michael
coldly. "If you were as clever as you are noisy, you might
see I should hardly do that. You're a pretty leader of a
gang of desperate mutineers, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Schwartz stared in amazement, struck dumb by the cool
daring of the person who had the courage and effrontery to
taunt and insult <i>him.</i></p>

<p>Michael turned to Brandt, Haff, Delarey, Guantaio,
Vogué, and the rest of Schwartz's familiars.</p>

<p>"A remarkable leader," he said. "Here you are, the gang
of you, making your wonderful plans, <i>and Lejaune knows
every word you say,</i> and precisely what you are going to
do&mdash;almost as soon as you know it yourselves!...
<i>Join</i> you? No, thanks. You have talked cleverly about
'pigs' and 'butchers'&mdash;but what about a lot of silly
<i>sheep?</i> You make me tired," and Michael produced a most
convincing and creditable yawn.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do?" he asked as they sat
open-mouthed. "Whatever it is, Lejaune will do it first,"
he added, "so you'd better do nothing."</p>

<p>"And Lejaune will do it first," I put in.</p>

<p>Michael's coolness, bitter contempt for them, and his
obvious sincerity, had won. They knew he spoke the truth,
and they knew he had not betrayed them to Lejaune.</p>

<p>I watched Guantaio, and decided that save perhaps for a
little courage, he was another Bolidar. Certainly Boldini
would hear of Michael's action, if Lejaune did not, as soon
as Guantaio could get away from his dupes.</p>

<p>"What to do!" murmured Schwartz. "What to do! If Lejaune
knows everything!..."</p>

<p>"Declare the whole thing off," said Michael, "and then
the noble soul who has told Lejaune so much, can tell him
that too," and Michael's eye rested on Guantaio.</p>

<p>It rested so long upon Guantaio, that that gentleman
felt constrained to leap to his feet and bluster.</p>

<p>"Do you <i>dare</i> to suggest..." he shouted and stopped.
<i>(Qui s'excuse s'accuse.)</i></p>

<p>"I did not know I had suggested anything," said Michael
softly. "Why <i>should</i> I suggest anything, my friend?"</p>

<p>"If it were you&mdash;I'd hang you to the wall with
bayonets through your ears, you yellow dog," growled
Schwartz, glaring at Guantaio.</p>

<p>"He lies! He lies!" screamed Guantaio.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Michael. "How do <i>you</i> know
what Lejaune knows?"</p>

<p>"I meant that you lie if you say that I betrayed the
plot," blustered Guantaio.</p>

<p>"I haven't said it," replied Michael. "It is only you
who have said it.... You seem to be another of the clever
ones...."</p>

<p>Michael's coolness and superiority were establishing
a kind of supremacy for him over these stupid creatures,
driven and bedevilled as they were by <i>cafard</i> and by
Lejaune.</p>

<p>They stared at each other and at us.</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" said Schwartz.... "By God! When I
catch the traitor..." he roared and shook his great fists
above his shaggy head.</p>

<p>"Nothing's to be done," replied Michael again,
"because you can <i>do</i> nothing. You are in Lejaune's hands
absolutely. Take my advice and drop this lunacy, and
you may hear nothing more of it.... There may be a new
Commandant here in a week or two..."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and his name may be Lejaune," answered
Schwartz.</p>

<p>"Anyhow&mdash;he <i>knows,</i> and he's got us," put in
Brandt. "I vote we all join in the plot and then all vote
it abandoned. Then he can't punish one more than another.
He can't put the whole blasted garrison in his cursed
cells, can he?"</p>

<p>"You're right," said Haff. "That's it. Abandon the whole
scheme, I say. <i>And</i> find out the traitor and give him a
night that he'll remember through eternity in Hell...."</p>

<p>But the ferocious Schwartz was of a different fibre, and
in his dogged and savage brain the murder of Lejaune was an
<i>idée fixe.</i></p>

<p>"Abandon nothing!" he roared, springing to his feet.
"I tell you I..." And then Michael laid his hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>"Silence, you noisy fool," he said quietly. "Don't you
understand <i>yet</i> that whatever you say now will go straight
to Lejaune?"</p>

<p>Schwartz, foaming, swung round on Guantaio.</p>

<p>"Get out of this," he growled menacingly, and pointed to
the door.</p>

<p>"I swear I..." began Guantaio indignantly.</p>

<p>"Get out, I say!" bawled Schwartz, "and when the time
comes for us to strike our blow&mdash;be careful. Let me
only <i>suspect</i> you, and I'll hang you to the flagstaff by
one foot.... By God, I will.... <i>Go!</i>"</p>

<p>Guantaio slunk off.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me again," said Michael. "As I told you,
Lejaune knows all about your plot to murder him and desert
at full moon. I did not tell him. But I was going to tell
him, if, after I had warned you, you refused to abandon the
scheme."</p>

<p>Schwartz growled and rose to his feet again.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," Michael went on, "I was going to warn you
first, to give you a chance to think better of it&mdash;in
which case I should have said nothing, of course.... But
now get this clear. If I know of any <i>new</i> scheme, or any
change of date or method, or anything that Lejaune does not
already know&mdash;I shall tell him.... Do you understand?
<i>...</i>"</p>

<p>"You cursed spy! You filthy, treacherous hound! You..."
roared Schwartz. "Why should <i>you</i>..."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be such a noisy nuisance, Schwartz,"
interrupted Michael. "I and a party of my friends don't
choose <i>to give Lejaune the chance he wants,</i> and we don't
really like murder either.... We have as much right to live
as you, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"<i>Live,</i>" snarled Brandt. "D'you call <i>this</i> living?"</p>

<p>"We aren't dying of thirst, anyhow," replied Michael.
"And if we are chivvied and hunted and hounded by
Lejaune, it's better than being hunted to our deaths by a
camel-company of <i>goums</i> or by the Touaregs, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"And who <i>are</i> your precious friends?" asked Haff.</p>

<p>"There are five of them here, for a start," said St.
André.</p>

<p>"And how many more?" asked Schwartz.</p>

<p>"You'll find that out when you start mutinying, my
friend," said Maris. "Don't fancy that all your band mean
all they say."</p>

<p>"In fact," put in Cordier, "you aren't the only
conspirators. There is also a plot <i>not</i> to mutiny, d'you
see?... And some good 'friends' of yours are in it too."</p>

<p>"So you'd better drop it, Schwartz," I added. "None of
us is a spy, and none of us will report anything to Lejaune
without telling you first and inviting you to give it
up. And if you refuse&mdash;Lejaune is going to know all
about it. You are simply surrounded by <i>real</i> spies, too,
mind."</p>

<p>"You cowardly hounds!" growled Schwartz. "There isn't a
<i>man</i> in the place.... <i>Cowards,</i> I say."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," agreed Michael. "But we've enough pluck
to stick things out while Lejaune is in command, if <i>you</i>
haven't.... Anyhow&mdash;you know how things stand now,"
and he strolled off, followed by St. André, Maris, Cordier,
and myself.</p>

<p>"This is a <i>maison de fous,</i>" observed St. André.</p>

<p>"A corner of the lunatic asylum of Hell," said
Cordier.</p>

<p>"Some of us had better keep awake to-night, I think,"
observed Maris.</p>

<p>"Especially if Bolidar is not in his bed," I added.</p>

<p>Michael drew me aside.</p>

<p>"We'll have another word with that sportsman," he said.
"I think he'll have the latest tip from the stable, and I
fancy he'll believe any promise we make him."</p>

<h3>§ 8</h3>

<p class="first">After completing our <i>astiquage</i> and other
preparations for the morrow, Michael and I strolled in the
courtyard.</p>

<p>"What'll Schwartz do now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Probably act to-night," said Michael, "unless he
swallowed our bluff that our party consists of more
than us five. He may be wondering as to how many of his
supposed adherents will really follow him if he starts the
show...."</p>

<p>"He may see how many will take a solemn oath to stand by
him and see it through, if he gives the word for to-night,"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"Quite likely," agreed Michael. "And if neither Guantaio
nor Bolidar knows about it, Schwartz may pull it off all
right."</p>

<p>"I don't somehow see Lejaune taken by surprise, when he
knows what's brewing," I said.</p>

<p>"No," replied Michael. "But he may be relying on Bolidar
giving him the tip."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do if we wake up and find that the
show has begun?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Stand by Lejaune," replied Michael. "France expects
that every halfpenny legionary this day will do his
dooty."</p>

<p>"It'll be too late to save Lejaune if we're awakened by
rifle-shots and 'alarums and excursions without,' won't
it?" I observed.</p>

<p>"That won't be our fault," said Michael. "If they murder
Lejaune and the others, all we can do is to decline to join
the mutineers."</p>

<p>"If we survive and they desert, I suppose the senior
soldier will carry on as Commandant of the fort," I mused.
That will take some deciding if only St. André, Maris,
Cordier, you, and I are left...."</p>

<p>"St. André has been a French officer," observed
Michael.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but they'll select you, old chap," I said.</p>

<p>"Then I'll use my powers to appoint St. André," smiled
my brother.</p>

<p>Someone passed and repassed us in the dark, and then
waited near the lantern by the quarter-guard, to identify
us by its light.</p>

<p>It was Schwartz.</p>

<p>"See here, you," he said as he recognised us. "Come with
me.... Now.... What are you going to do if someone kills
Lejaune without doing himself the honour of consulting your
lordships?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Michael, as we walked away from the
light. "We shall continue in our duty as soldiers. We shall
obey the orders of the senior person remaining true to his
salt and the Flag."</p>

<p>"The devil burn their filthy Flag!" snarled Schwartz. "I
spit on it."</p>

<p>"A pity you came under it, if that's what you think,"
said Michael.</p>

<p>"Then you and your gang of cowards and blacklegs will
not interfere?" asked Schwartz.</p>

<p>"If you will desert, you will desert," replied my
brother. "That is not our affair. If we know what you are
going to do, we shall report it, if we can't stop it.
If we can prevent mutiny and murder we shall.... As for
deserting&mdash;I should say the Legion would be well rid
of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you do, do you, Mr. Preacher?" replied Schwartz,
who was evidently putting great and unwonted restraint upon
himself. "What I want to know is whether you are going to
fight us or not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;if ordered to," replied Michael.</p>

<p>"And if there is no one to order you?" sneered
Schwartz.</p>

<p>"Then obviously we shall not be ordered to, my good
ass," was the unsoothing reply. "And we certainly shan't
hinder your departure.... Far from it," he added.</p>

<p>Schwartz turned to go.</p>

<p>"Look to yourselves! I warn you! Look to yourselves," he
growled.</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall. Don't you worry," replied Michael.</p>

<p>"They'll do it to-night," he added, as we watched
Schwartz disappear. "We must secure our rifles and we must
keep awake."</p>

<p>I wondered how much longer we should be able to stand
this intolerable strain, in addition to the terrific heat
and monotony of hardship.</p>

<p>"Go and look for Bolidar," said my brother after a brief
silence. "I'll hunt round too. Bring him here if you find
him. We'll ask him what's likely to happen if they mutiny
to-night. Then we can fix up a plan of action with St.
André and the others."</p>

<p>I went back to the barrack-room.</p>

<p>Bolidar was deep in conclave with Schwartz, Brandt,
Haff, Vogué, Delarey, and one or two others, round
Schwartz's bed.</p>

<p>I pretended to go to my <i>paquetage</i> for something, and
then retired and reported to Michael.</p>

<p>"That's all right then," he said. "Whatever the fools
fix up for to-night will be reported to Lejaune to-night,
and he will know what to do.</p>

<p>"We'll have a word with Bolidar though, by and by," he
added. "Nothing like knowing what's going to happen."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, we returned to the reeking, stifling
room. Most of the men were lying on their cots. Bolidar was
sitting on a bench, polishing his bayonet.</p>

<p>"Will you polish mine too?" I said, going over to him.
"Follow me out," I whispered, as I gave him my bayonet.</p>

<p>I strolled back to my cot, began to undress, and then,
taking my mug, went out of the room as though for water.</p>

<p>Watching the lighted doorway I waited in the
darkness.</p>

<p>Ten minutes or so later, Bolidar came out.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Lejaune does not believe a word about the diamond not
being here," he said, "and the mutineers are going to shoot
him and all the non-coms. on morning parade to-morrow
instead of at night. They think he will be expecting it
at night, as some informer must have told him that is the
plan.... He'll be off his guard.... They are going to kill
Dupré and Boldini simultaneously with Lejaune.... If your
party is a big one they are going to leave you alone,
if you leave them alone. They will load themselves up
with water, wine, food, and ammunition, and march out at
sunset.</p>

<p>"Blanc, who has been a sailor, is going to lead
them straight over the desert to Morocco, by Lejaune's
compass.... Schwartz is to be Captain; Brandt and Haff,
Lieutenants; Delarey and Vogué, Sergeants; and Glock and
Hartz, Corporals.... There will be twenty privates....</p>

<p>"They are going to court martial Guantaio, and if he is
found guilty they are going to hang him.... <i>I</i> know enough
to get him hung, the dirty traitor...."</p>

<p>"And you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am to shoot Lejaune," he replied, "to prove my
sincerity and good faith. If I don't, I am to be shot
myself.... Guantaio has been maligning me to Schwartz."</p>

<p>"Have you told Lejaune this?" I asked this astonishing
creature.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> <i>am just going to do so now,</i>" he replied, and I
gasped.</p>

<p>"And I suppose he'll arrest them to-night?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Probably. <i>If</i> <i>he believes me,</i>" was the interesting
answer.</p>

<p>"What if he doesn't?" I enquired, and, at that, the
wretch had another "nerve-storm" or hysterical fit of
trembling, with demented gesticulations and mutterings.</p>

<p>"What <i>shall</i> I do? What <i>shall</i> I do?" he kept on.
"What <i>will</i> become of me? God help me! Help me! Help
me!"</p>

<p>"Look here," said I. "You tell me and my brother
everything&mdash;the absolute truth, mind&mdash;and we'll
save you all right, provided you do nothing against us. No
covering with your rifle, mind!"</p>

<p>He clutched my hand in his hot shaking fists.</p>

<p>"You stand in honestly with our party, and you'll be
safe," I went on. "We'll prevent the mutiny, and nobody
will be killed. Neither you nor anybody else."</p>

<p>I hoped I spoke the truth. Perhaps if I now told
Schwartz that I knew about the new morning scheme, and
assured him that Lejaune knew it too, he'd own himself
defeated and give it all up. On the other hand, he might
run amok, yelling to his gang to follow him.... Lejaune's
prearranged plans would probably settle their business
promptly. Would Lejaune then go and shoot whomsoever else
he thought might be better dead?</p>

<p>Bolidar slunk off, and I went back to the
barrack-room.</p>

<p>Taking my Arabic copy of the Q'ran from the shelf above
my bed, I winked at Michael, and opening the book, seated
myself beside him, and began to read in Arabic, as we often
did.</p>

<p>Having read a verse, I went on in the same monotone, as
though still reading, and said in Arabic:</p>

<p>"To-morrow. Morning. They will kill. One now goes to
give information," and then went on with the next verse. I
then gave the book to Michael, who followed the same plan.
Soon I heard between actual verses:</p>

<p>"We have warned them. Say nothing. He will strike
to-night. Do not sleep. I will tell our friends," and then
another verse of the wisdom of the Prophet, before closing
the book.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Bolidar entered the room and began to
undress.</p>

<p>"What about my bayonet, you, Bolidar?" I called across
to him.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;half a minute, Smith," he replied, and began
polishing it.</p>

<p>A little later he brought it over, and as he bent over
my bed to hang the weapon on its hook, whispered:</p>

<p>"I have not told him.... To-morrow," and went back to
his place.</p>

<p>Under cover of the "Lights out" bugle, I repeated this
to Michael.</p>

<p>"That's all right then," said he. "We shall have a quiet
night."</p>

<p>And then perfect silence descended on the room as
usual.</p>

<h3>§ 9</h3>

<p class="first">It was an unpleasant night for me,
nevertheless, for I by no means shared Michael's faith in
its quiet.</p>

<p>What more likely, I thought, than that Lejaune should
choose to-night for his anticipatory counter-stroke? He
must have an iron nerve or very great faith in his spies,
otherwise he could hardly continue thus to sit on the
powder-barrel when the fuse was alight.</p>

<p>Or had he other and surer sources of information, than
the tales of Bolidar, and Guantaio's reports to Boldini?
Was one of Schwartz's most trusted lieutenants merely
Lejaune's <i>agent provocateur?</i></p>

<p>Could Schwartz himself be Lejaune's jackal? No, that was
nonsense, and this horrible atmosphere of treachery and
suspicion was poisoning my mind. Whereas Lejaune himself
was wholly evil and was probably after Michael's fabulous
jewel&mdash;patiently and remorselessly creeping towards it
along a path that led through quagmires of treachery and
rivers of blood&mdash;Schwartz was a comparatively honest
and honourable brute, madly thirsting for vengeance upon a
savage beast-tamer who had driven him to utter desperation
by injustice and savage cruelty. And, save for Bolidar and
Guantaio, his followers were like him, brave men of average
character, de-humanised by an inhuman system and the more
inhuman monster who applied it.</p>

<p>And why did not the monster strike! For what was he
waiting, when every hour increased his danger? Surely
it could not be merely the love of the fearless man for
prolonging a terribly menacing and precarious situation?</p>

<p>Could it be that, before taking action, he really wished
to know absolutely for certain what Michael and I were
going to do when the mutineers rose?</p>

<p>Or was he waiting to be surer of Boldini or Dupré?</p>

<p>Of course, if he felt that in the presence of the
"diamond" no reliance could be placed on either of these
two colleagues, and if, as a shrewd and experienced
judge of men, he estimated Bolidar and Guantaio at their
true worth, or worthlessness&mdash;perhaps it was quite
impossible for him to act at all. If practically every one
in the garrison belonged to one of two parties&mdash;the
"honest" mutineers determined to desert, or the rascally
thieves determined to steal the great jewel and get away
with it&mdash;what could the man do?</p>

<p>Was he hoping to use the thieves to fight the mutineers
and to deal with the surviving party himself? Hardly that,
for the mutineers greatly outnumbered the thieves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, could he not quite easily secure
the arms of the mutineers, and arrest the men in their
beds by employing the thieves? He could&mdash; but what
then? The thieves would murder him and escape with the
jewel&mdash;probably releasing the mutineers and organising
them as the "diamond's" unsuspecting escort to Morocco. And
each man of the thief-party (Boldini, Guantaio, Colonna,
Gotto, and quite probably Vogué and Dupré) would hope that
by good luck or more likely by good management&mdash;he
would be sole survivor of the thief-party.</p>

<p>I tried to put myself in Lejaune's place.</p>

<p>What should I do if I were he, in such circumstances?
If I wished first to save my life, and secondly to secure
a gem of great price which I believed to be reposing in
the pouch of one of the two or three men upon whom I could
depend in time of trouble?</p>

<p>And I found it easier to ask the question than to answer
it, since one party wanted my life and the other party
wanted the jewel.</p>

<p>Having tried to put myself in Lejaune's place, I began
to understand his delay in acting. He did nothing because
he <i>could</i> do nothing.</p>

<p>I almost began to pity the man as I realised his
position. He had not a soul to turn to in his loneliness
and danger. Well&mdash;he was now reaping the reward of his
consistent brutality to all who were his subordinates, as
well as of his beastly avarice.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had always been backed by the immeasurable
power and authority of his superiors, and could inevitably
rely upon their inalienable support and unswerving
approval. Now he had no superiors, and, face to face with
the men whom he had so long outraged, bedevilled, and
wronged, he must stand or fall alone.</p>

<p>And it looked as though he must fall.</p>

<p>Then an idea occurred to me. <i>Had he sent for outside
help?</i> Was a column already on its way from Tokotu, where
there were Senegalese as well as a mule-mounted company of
the Legion? Was that what he was waiting for?</p>

<p>No. In the first place he would sooner, I felt
absolutely certain, lose his life than send out an appeal
for help against the very men he was supposed to command,
the very men whose trembling disciplined fear of him was
his chief pride and loudest boast. It would certainly be
the end of all promotion for Adjudant Lejaune if he had
to do such a thing as that. In the second place it might
also destroy this chance of getting the fabulous gem. It
was only in very troubled waters that he, in his position,
could fish for that.</p>

<p>I decided that there had been no S.O.S. appeal from
Zinderneuf to Tokotu.</p>

<p>I tossed and turned in my hot and uncomfortable bed
as the problem tossed and turned in my hot uncomfortable
brain; and my attempt to decide what I should do in
Lejaune's place ended in my deciding that I simply did not
know what I <i>could</i> do.</p>

<p>It almost seemed best for Lejaune to put himself at the
head of the "honest" mutineers, arrest the thief-party, and
then appeal to the others with promises of amendment in his
conduct and reform of their condition.... But arrest the
thieves for what?... And suppose the mutineers laughed at
the promised amelioration of their lot?</p>

<p>It was a hopeless <i>impasse.</i> I gave it up and turned
once more on to my other side. This brought my face toward
the door and there, in the doorway, stood&mdash;Lejaune.</p>

<p>There stood Lejaune&mdash;looking from bed to bed. He
was quite alone and he held a revolver in his hand.... Whom
was he going to shoot?</p>

<p>Was this the beginning of the end?</p>

<p>Without thinking, I raised myself on my elbow.</p>

<p>He saw me at once, and, first placing a finger to his
lips, beckoned to me.</p>

<p>I stared in amazement.</p>

<p>Frowning savagely, he beckoned again, with a swift and
imperious movement of his arm.</p>

<p>What was the idea? Was he going to murder me outside?
Or was he going to tell me to fetch Michael out? In that
case, had I better refuse or just spring on him, get the
revolver, and... and what? Neither murder nor mutiny was
going to improve our precarious position.</p>

<p>As these thoughts flashed through my mind, I seized my
trousers and tunic, struggled into them, and tiptoed to the
door.</p>

<p>"Follow me," said Lejaune, and led the way to his
quarters.</p>

<p>Closing the door of his bare, comfortless little room,
and seating himself at the table, Lejaune stared at me
in silence, his hot arrogant eyes glaring beneath heavy
eyebrows contracted in a fierce evil-tempered frown.</p>

<p>"Do you and your miserable brother want to live?" he
suddenly growled. "Answer me, you dog."</p>

<p>"On the whole, I think so, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" I replied,
trying to strike a note between defiant impudence and
cringing servility.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;on the whole, you do, do you?" sneered
Lejaune, and again stared in silence. "Well&mdash;if you
do, you'd better listen carefully to what I say, for only I
can save you. D'you understand? Answer me, you swine."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" I replied.</p>

<p>"See here then, you infection," he went on, "there's
some talk among those dogs, of a jewel. A diamond your gang
of jewel-thieves got away with, in London. Also there is a
plot among them to murder you both and steal it, and desert
with it."</p>

<p>"Is that so, <i>mon Adjudant?</i>" said I, as he stopped.</p>

<p>"Don't you answer me! God smite you, you unspeakable
corruption!" he roared. "Yes, it is so," he went on,
mimicking me savagely, "and I know all about it, as I
know everything else that is done, and said, and thought
too&mdash; <i>thought,</i> I say&mdash;in this place.... Now I
don't care a curse what you stole, and I don't care a curse
what becomes of you and that anointed thief, your brother;
but I won't have plots and plans and murders in any force
under <i>my</i> command. Understand <i>that!</i> D'you hear me,
sacred animal? Answer me."</p>

<p>"I hear you, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" I admitted.</p>

<p>"Very well then," he growled. "I am going to teach these
sacred curs to attend to their duty and leave diamonds
and plots alone. By God, I am! To that end, I am going
to detail you and your brother and a few more&mdash;say,
Légionnaires St. André, Cordier, and Maris, as a Corporal's
guard to arrest the ringleaders among those impudent swine.
And I myself am going to attend to the business. You'll
act at my personal orders, under my personal command, and
you'll shoot down any man whom I tell you to shoot&mdash;as
mutineering mad dogs s<i>hould</i> be shot. D'you hear me, you
fish-faced, cod-eyed, bug-eating, dumb <i>crétin!</i> Answer
me!"</p>

<p>"I hear you, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" I replied.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;say so then, grinning imbecile. And to put
an end to this thrice-accursed nonsense, and prevent any
more disturbances of this sort, your brother will hand over
this diamond to me. I'll put it where no plots and plans
will trouble it.... You and your cursed jewels! Wrecking
discipline and causing trouble! You ought to be doing
twenty years in gaol, the pair of you.... D'you hear me,
blast your soul? Answer me, damn you."</p>

<p>"I hear you, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" I replied.</p>

<p>"Very well. To-morrow morning, you and your brother
and the others will have duties assigned you. You'll be
given ammunition. You or your brother or both, will be put
over the magazine, and will shoot anyone, except myself,
who approaches it. <i>Anyone,</i> you understand, whether
non-commissioned officer or <i>légionnaire....</i> I'll teach
the swine&mdash;by God, I'll teach them!... Now then... it
was your brother I wanted, but you happened to be awake
and I saw no point in entering that cage of treacherous
hyenas&mdash;go and tell your brother what I have said, and
as soon as I have that diamond locked for safety in the
Company treasure-chest, I'll give you a chance to save your
worthless lives....</p>

<p>"Listen carefully now. Creep back and wake your brother,
St. André, Maris, and Cordier, and tell them to get up
and steal silently from the room with their rifles.... I
shall be at the door with that revolver and I'll shoot
<i>anybody</i>&mdash;on the first movement that I don't like....
Go!..."</p>

<p>I saluted and turned about.</p>

<p>So the hour had come! And Lejaune was about to act!
Moreover he was going to act on Bolidar's information that
Michael, Maris, St. André, Cordier, and I had refused to
join the mutineers, and so belonged to neither party. He
was going to make us five loyal soldiers the executioners
of the rebels.</p>

<p>He had a perfect right to order us to seize any mutineer
and to shoot the man if he resisted arrest. Also it was our
plain duty to obey him....</p>

<p>But Michael? What would happen when Michael denied any
knowledge of a diamond? How would he fare at Lejaune's
hands when the mutiny had been suppressed? Lejaune's bare
word was sufficient to send him to join the defeated
mutineers&mdash;whether they were in the next world
or in that antechamber of the next world, the Penal
Battalion....</p>

<p>"Make a sound&mdash;or a false move, and you'll be the
first that dies&mdash;the first of many, I hope," growled
Lejaune, as I crept down the passage between thick mud
walls, and I felt the muzzle of his revolver jabbed into
the small of my back.</p>

<p>The blood surged to my head, and I all but sprang round.
One second's space of time for a drive at the point of his
jaw&mdash;and I asked no more.</p>

<p>But he wouldn't give me that second, and I couldn't
do much for Michael with my spine shattered by a ·450
expanding bullet. Lejaune would think as much of shooting
me as he would of putting his foot on a scorpion.... And
if, by any wild chance, I succeeded, and knocked him out
and secured the revolver&mdash;how should we be any the
better off? Boldini and his gang, and probably Dupré too,
were after the "diamond," and would kill Michael to get
it....</p>

<p>With Lejaune following, I reached the door of our
barrack-room. Here the <i>adjudant</i> halted, his revolver
raised, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Your brother, Maris, Cordier, St.
André&mdash;quick...." I crept to Michael's bed.</p>

<p>What would happen if he sprang up with a shout, and
roused the snoring sleepers around him? Could Lejaune
overawe the lot, or would they, empty-handed, have the
courage to rush him? Probably they would not. Everybody
waits for a lead in a case like that.</p>

<p>I began whispering in Michael's ear.</p>

<p>"Beau, old chap!... It's John.... Don't make a noise....
Beau, old chap!... It's John.... Hush! Don't make a
noise...."</p>

<p>He woke, and was instantly alert.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Take your tunic and trousers and boots, get your rifle,
and go out. Lejaune is relying on our party. Take your
bayonet...."</p>

<p>He saw Lejaune in the doorway, near which was the
night-lamp, and got off his cot.</p>

<p>I crept to St. André, and woke him in the same way.</p>

<p>"The <i>adjudant</i> wants us," I whispered. "He's at the
door."</p>

<p>"Good!" said St. André. "It is time he did
something."</p>

<p>Maris also woke quietly, and soon grasped what was
wanted of him.</p>

<p>By the time I had roused Cordier, Michael was creeping
from the room, dressed, his rifle in his hand. I saw
Lejaune give him some cartridges from his bulging
side-pockets. I crept out too, taking my rifle and bayonet,
and Lejaune gave me ten cartridges.</p>

<p>"Go outside and load," he whispered. "Quick.... Then
shoot any man, at once, if he sets his foot on the floor,
after a warning."</p>

<p>We charged our magazines and stood behind Lejaune in
the doorway, rifles at the ready. St. André joined us and
received the same orders. Lejaune shook his fist at Maris
and Cordier, and beckoned to them angrily. Not one of the
sleepers stirred.</p>

<p>When the other two joined us, Lejaune said:</p>

<p>"St. André and Cordier&mdash;remain here until relieved.
If any man wakes, order <i>silence,</i> cover him with your
rifle, and say you'll shoot him if he leaves his bed. <i>Do</i>
it at once, to any man and every man, who disobeys. Fail,
and I'll shoot you myself.... Follow me, you others," and
he quietly returned to his quarters.</p>

<p>"Guard the door, you," he said to Maris, "and shoot
<i>anybody</i> who approaches. <i>Anybody,</i> I say."</p>

<p>"Now you, <i>quick,</i>" he said, entering the room and
closing the door. "Give me this wretched diamond that is
the cause of all this trouble."</p>

<p>He glared at Michael.</p>

<p>"You jewel-thieves have corrupted the whole of this
garrison, and are a menace to discipline. I'll take charge
of it now; and then I'll take charge of some of those swine
who think they can plot murder and robbery and desertion
in <i>my</i> Company, by God!... Out with it, you thieving
gaolbird.... <i>Quick....</i> Unless you want your throat cut by
those mad dogs of mutineers who've fixed <i>your</i> business
for this morning, at parade.... Oh yes, I know all about
it.... <i>Quick,</i> I say&mdash;the Devil blast your dirty
soul..." and he shook his fist.</p>

<p>Michael stared back, as one lost in astonishment and
wonder.</p>

<p>"'Diamond,' <i>Monsieur l'Adjudant?</i>" he murmured.</p>

<p>Lejaune's swarthy face was suffused, his eyes bulged and
blazed.</p>

<p>"You try any tricks with me and I'll blow your filthy
head off&mdash;here and now!" he roared, picking up his
revolver from the table where he had laid it.</p>

<p>"Give me that diamond, you scurvy hound, and I'll
keep it until I know whose property it is. D'you think
I'm going to have the discipline of this fort spoiled by
every cursed runaway jewel-thief that chooses to hide here
with his swag, and tempt honest men?... Out with it, you
gallows-cheating gaol-breaker, before I put you where you
belong.... <i>Quick!</i>"</p>

<p>"I have no diamond, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" replied Michael
quietly, and giving back look for look.</p>

<p>"As I could have told you, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" I put in,
"my brother has never had a diamond in his life and neither
have I."</p>

<p>Words failed Lejaune.</p>

<p>I thought (and hoped) that he was going to have
an apoplectic fit. His red face went purple and his
eyes bulged yet more. He drew back his lips, baring
his cruel-looking teeth and causing his moustache to
bristle.</p>

<p>He raised and pointed the revolver, and I was just
about to bring up my rifle, but had the presence of mind
to realise that he could shoot twice with the lifted
revolver, before I could even bring my rifle up to cover
him. Michael did not turn a hair, and I was thankful that
I, too, had sufficient restraint to stand motionless
at attention. A movement would have been mutiny, and
probably&mdash;death.</p>

<p>I felt certain that Lejaune would have shot us both,
then and there (and would have searched Michael's body),
but for the precarious position in which he himself
stood, and the fact that he needed us alive&mdash;for the
present.</p>

<p>At any moment we might hear the rifles of St. André and
Cordier, as the mutineers rushed them. Or, at any moment,
for all that Lejaune knew, the mutineers might burst into
the room, headed by St. André, Cordier, and Maris, to kill
him. He believed that, like Michael and me, these three
were faithful&mdash;but he did not <i>know</i> they were.</p>

<p>He was a brave man. Situated as he was, his life hanging
by a thread, he still attended to the business in hand. He
turned his heavy glare from Michael to me.</p>

<p>"Oh? You would talk, would you?" he said, in a quiet
and most sinister tone of terrible self-repression. "Well!
Well! You haven't <i>much</i> more time for talking. Not <i>many</i>
more words to say.... Would you like to make another remark
or two before I shoot you?... No?... Won't you speak again,
gaol-bird? A little prayer, perhaps? <i>...</i>" and the
scoundrel turned the revolver from Michael's face to mine,
and back again to Michael's.</p>

<p>It was most unpleasant, the twitching finger of an
infuriated homicidal maniac on the hair trigger of a loaded
revolver, a yard from one's face&mdash;a maniac who longed
for our deaths that he might enrich himself beyond the
dreams of his own avarice!</p>

<p>He began to swear blasphemously, horribly, foully. All
that he had learnt of vileness among the vile with whom he
had consorted, he poured over us. He literally and actually
foamed.</p>

<p>We stood like statues. He put the revolver down in front
of him, the better to tear his hair with both hands.</p>

<p>I thought of the aborigines of the Congo over whom his
power had been absolute, and whose lives and deaths were in
his hand and mere questions of his profit and loss...</p>

<p>And then suddenly, a thought which had been clamouring
for attention for some minutes suddenly occupied my mind
and brought comfort and a curious sense of security.</p>

<p>Of course, Lejaune would do nothing to us until the
mutiny was quelled, and he was again unthreatened and
supreme.</p>

<p>We five were his only defence, the sole support of his
authority, his one chance of saving not only his life, but
his reputation and career. Obviously he would not kill
two-fifths nor one-fifth of his loyal troops at the moment
of his greatest need. It was absurd.</p>

<p>And then, without thought, I did what would have
been the bravest thing of my life if it had been done
consciously, and with intent. I defied, insulted, and
outfaced Lejaune!</p>

<p>"Look here, Lejaune," said I coolly, and in the manner
of an Oxford undergraduate addressing an extortionate
cabman or an impudent servant. "Look here, Lejaune, don't
be a silly fool. Can't you understand that in about two
minutes you may be hanging on that wall with bayonets
through your hands&mdash;and <i>left</i> there, in a burning
fort, to die? Or pinned out on the roof with the sun in
your face! Don't be such an ass. We've got no diamond and
you've got five good men to fight for you, more's the pity!
Stop gibbering about jewels and be thankful that we five
know our duty if you don't...."</p>

<p>"<i>Very</i> Stout Fella," murmured my brother. "<i>Order of
Michael</i> for you, John."</p>

<p>What would happen if the meanest slave in his palace
went up to the Emperor of Abyssinia and smacked his
face?... I don't know. Nor did Lejaune, or he would have
done it, I think.</p>

<p>Probably the Emperor would begin by gasping and feeling
faint. Lejaune gasped and looked faint.</p>

<p>Then he sprang to his feet with a sound that was
a mixture of a roar, howl, and scream. As he did so,
Michael's left hand made a swift, circling swoop, passed
under Lejaune's hand, and swept the revolver to the
floor.</p>

<p>Almost as it clattered to the ground, my bayonet was at
Lejaune's throat and my finger was round my trigger.</p>

<p>Whether Lejaune had been going to shoot or not, I do not
know, but he certainly looked as though rage had destroyed
the last of his sanity, and our death was all he cared
about.</p>

<p>Anyhow, he couldn't shoot now.</p>

<p>"Move&mdash;and I'll kill you," I hissed dramatically,
feeling like a cinema star and an ass.</p>

<p>Michael picked up the revolver.</p>

<p>"So you <i>are</i> mutineers, you beautiful loyal lying
grandsons of Gadarene swine, are you?" panted Lejaune,
moving his head from side to side, and drawing deep breaths
as though choking.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Michael calmly. "We're decent
soldiers wishing to do our duty properly&mdash;not to
babble about diamonds two minutes before a mutiny breaks
out.... Man, don't you know the fort will be burnt, the
garrison gone, and you dead (if you are lucky), in an
hour's time&mdash;unless you do your job while you've a
chance?..."</p>

<p>"'<i>Cré bon sang de bon jour de bon malheur de bon Dieu
de Dieu de sort,</i>" swore Lejaune, "and I'll deal with you
after this <i>chien d'une révolte.</i> But wait! You wait,
my clever little friends. Hell's bells! I'll teach you
one of my little lessons.... If you don't both die <i>en
crapaudine,</i> by God, you shall live <i>en crapaudine...</i>
."</p>

<p>"Reward for saving your valuable life, I suppose," said
Michael.</p>

<p>"You'll do that as your simple duty, my little friend.
Oh, you love your duty. You are '<i>decent soldiers wishing
to do your duty properly and not babble about diamonds,</i>'
I believe? <i>...</i> Good! Come and do your duty then. We'll
see what you'll babble about afterwards, with your mouths
full of salt and sand, <i>en crapaudine,</i> eh? Perhaps
you'll prefer drops of water to diamonds then, eh!... You
wait...."</p>

<p>He turned to me.</p>

<p>"And you talked about hanging on walls. And being pinned
out in the sun, my little friend, eh? Will you kindly wait
until I have you strapped up in a cell, <i>of which I alone
have the key?</i> Perhaps it will not be I who '<i>jabbers about
jewels</i>' then, eh?... You wait...."</p>

<p>"Your turn to jabber now, anyhow, Lejaune," said I
wearily. "You're a fatiguing fellow. What about doing
something <i>now,</i> and less of this 'waiting' business?"</p>

<p>The man pulled himself together, exerted his undeniably
powerful will, and got the better of his immediate
impulse.</p>

<p>"Come with me," he said quietly, and with a certain
dignity. "Our real conversation is postponed until I have
dealt with a few other unspeakables. We will then see what
happens to those that threaten officers and point rifles at
them.... Put that revolver down...."</p>

<p>"Open the door, John," said Michael. I lowered my rifle
and did so.</p>

<p>Maris, on guard outside, looked at me enquiringly.
Presumably he had heard Lejaune's roars of rage.</p>

<p>Michael put the revolver on the table.</p>

<p>Lejaune took it up and strode to the open door.</p>

<p>"Follow me, you three," he said, and led the way to the
barrack-room, without hesitating to turn his back to us.</p>

<p>Apparently he had complete faith in our loyalty to duty,
and knew that he could depend upon us to obey any proper
military order. At the door of the barrack-room stood St.
André and Cordier, <i>faisant sentinelle.</i></p>

<p>"Any trouble?" growled Lejaune, as they silently sprang
to attention.</p>

<p>"No one has moved, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" replied St.
André.</p>

<p>"Put down your rifles," said Lejaune to us three, "and
bring all arms out of this room, quickly and silently. You
other two will shoot any man who leaves his bed."</p>

<p>We set to work, emptying the arms-rack of the Lebel
rifles first, and then going from bed to bed and removing
the bayonet from its hook at the head of each.</p>

<p>A steel bayonet-scabbard struck a tin mug, and a man sat
up. It was Vogué.</p>

<p>"Cover him," said Lejaune, and the two rifles turned
toward the startled man. He looked in the direction of the
voice.</p>

<p>"Lie down, man," I whispered. Vogué fell back instantly
and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>It was remarkable with what speed slumber claimed
him.</p>

<p>On my last journey to the door, with a double armful of
bayonets, the inevitable happened. One slipped and fell. As
it did so, I shot out my foot. The bayonet struck it and
made little noise, but my foot knocked against a cot and
its occupant sprang up, blinking.</p>

<p>"<i>Himmel!</i> What's that?" he said.</p>

<p>It was Glock.</p>

<p>"Lie down, Glock," I whispered. "Look," and I nodded my
head toward the door.</p>

<p>"Shoot him if he moves," said Lejaune calmly.</p>

<p>Glock lay down again, staring at Lejaune, as a
hypnotised rabbit at a snake.</p>

<p>I passed on, and in another minute there was not a
weapon in the room, nor was there a sound. None slept so
deeply as Corporal Boldini, who was nearest to the door.</p>

<p>Lejaune took a key from his pocket. "Into the armoury
with them, St. André, Cordier, and Maris, quick!" he said.
"You, St. André, mount guard. Send the key back to me with
Cordier and Maris, and shoot <i>instantly</i> any living soul
that approaches the place, other than one of these four
men.</p>

<p>"Now then," he continued to Michael and me, as the
others crept off, laden with rifles, "some of these swine
are awake, so keep your eyes open.... If several jump at
once, shoot Schwartz and Brandt. Then Haff and Delarey. If
only one man moves, leave him to me...."</p>

<p>A very, very faint lightening of the darkness outside
the windows showed that the false dawn was breaking. As I
stared into the room, I found myself trying to recall a
verse about "Dawn's left hand" being in the sky and,</p>

<blockquote> "<i>Awake! for morning in the bowl of night<br>
Has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight;<br> And
lo! the Hunter of the East has caught<br> The Sultan's
turrets in a noose of light.</i>" </blockquote>

<p>I tried to put it into Arabic, and wondered how the
original sounded in the liquid Persian.... Was it "turrets"
or "terrace"?...</p>

<p>What sort of a stone was Lejaune about to fling into the
bowl of night?...</p>

<p>Would he order the four of us, when the other two
returned, to open fire and begin a massacre of sleeping
men!&mdash;an indiscriminate slaughter?...</p>

<p>He was quite capable of it. These were mutineers who had
threatened his life, and, worse still, his sacred authority
and discipline.</p>

<p>Why should he wait, he would argue, for a court martial
to do it? Besides, if he waited, there would never be a
court martial. He could not permanently arrest the whole
lot with only five men, and guard his prisoners, garrison
his fort, carry on all the work of the place, and mount
sentries, with five men. What would happen when the five
slept, ate, cooked, mounted guard on the roof? It couldn't
be done. It was their lives or his, and the very existence
of the fort.</p>

<p>Perhaps he'd only shoot the ringleaders?</p>

<p>What should I do if Lejaune ordered me to open fire on
unarmed men in their beds? What would Michael do?</p>

<p>What was my duty in such a case, with orders from
such an officer? Private conscience said, "Absolutely
impossible! Sheer murder! You are not an executioner....
Not the public hangman."</p>

<p>Military conscience said, "Absolutely necessary. These
men are guilty of the greatest military crime. It is
Lejaune'e duty to save the fort at any coat. <i>Your</i> duty is
to obey your officer implicitly. If you refuse, you are a
mutineer, as criminal as they."</p>

<p>The windows grew lighter.</p>

<p>Maris and Cordier crept back, their work completed.
Maris gave Lejaune the key of the armoury.</p>

<p>"St. André is on guard over the magazine, <i>mon
Adjudant,</i>" whispered he, saluting.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lejaune. "Maris, Brown, and Cordier,
remain here. Shoot instantly any man who puts his foot to
the ground. If there's a rush, shoot Schwartz first. Your
own lives depend on your smartness. They're all unarmed,
remember.... Come with me, you, Smith, and I'll disarm the
guard and sentries.... Use your wits if you want to see
daylight again."</p>

<p>He glared round the room.</p>

<p>"Aha, my little birds in a trap," he growled. "You'd
plot against <i>me. Me, l'Adjudant Lejaune,</i> would you?...
Ah!..."</p>

<p>I followed him down the passage.</p>

<p>"I'll clear that dog of a sentry off the roof first,"
he said. "Then there'll be no shooting down on us when I
disarm the guard...."</p>

<p>Leading the way, he went up the stairs that opened on to
the flat roof, round which ran a thick, low, crenellated
wall, embrasured for rifle-fire.</p>

<p>A sentry patrolled this roof at night, though the high
lookout platform was not occupied, for obvious reasons,
during the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>Lejaune relieved the sentry and posted me. He then took
the man's rifle from him and ordered him to go below to the
guard-room and request Sergeant Dupré to come up to the
roof.</p>

<p>"Now," said he to me as the man went, "come here. Look,"
and he pointed down into the courtyard to the open door of
the guard-room. "I shall order Sergeant Dupré to take the
rifles of the guard and sentries, and then to send one man
out of the guard-house with the lot. If any man comes out
with only one rifle, shoot him at once. Shoot anybody who
comes through that doorway, except a man with half a dozen
rifles. And shoot to kill too."</p>

<p>I raised my rifle and covered the lighted doorway below
me, at the other side of the courtyard.</p>

<p>"You understand," growled Lejaune. "The moment Sergeant
Dupré enters that guard-room, after I've spoken to him, you
shoot anybody who carries one rifle. A man with a rifle is
a proclaimed and confessed mutineer...."</p>

<p>I felt that he was right, and that it was my duty
to obey him, little as I relished the idea of shooting
comrades like bolting rabbits.</p>

<p>Should I shout, "<i>Drop that rifle!</i>" before I fired, and
shoot if the man did not do it? I wondered if Lejaune would
kill me if I did so.</p>

<p>I saw the relieved sentry cross the courtyard and enter
the guard-room, and a moment later Sergeant Dupré came
out.</p>

<p>"Watch!" growled Lejaune. "That sentry will talk, and
they may make a rush."</p>

<p>Nothing stirred below.</p>

<p>Sergeant Dupré came up the stairs, out on to the roof,
and saluted Lejaune.</p>

<p>"I want the rifles of the guard and sentries, Sergeant
Dupré," said Lejaune. "Send one man, and only one, to me
here, with the lot. Shoot instantly any man who hesitates
for a second. No man is to leave the guard-room (except the
one who carries all the rifles), or he'll be shot as he
does so...." And he pointed at me, standing with my rifle
resting in an embrasure and covering the doorway below.</p>

<p>Sergeant Dupré saluted and turned about with a quiet,
"Very good, <i>mon Adjudant.</i>"</p>

<p>He descended the stairs and emerged into the courtyard,
crossed it to the gate beneath the gate-house, and took the
rifle from the sentry there. The man preceded him to the
guard-room. Dupré visited the other sentries, repeating the
procedure.</p>

<p>A minute after the Sergeant's last visit to the
guard-room, a man came out. I was greatly relieved to see
that he carried three or four rifles over each shoulder,
the muzzles in his hands.</p>

<p>"Watch," growled Lejaune. "They may all rush out
together now. Open rapid fire if they do," and he himself
also covered the doorway with the rifle he had taken from
the sentry.</p>

<p>The man with the rifles, one Gronau, a big stupid
Alsatian, came up the stairs. I did not look round, but
kept my eyes fixed on the doorway through which a yellow
light (from "where the great guard-lantern guttered")
struggled with that of the dawn.</p>

<p>I heard a clattering crash behind me and then I did
look round, fully expecting to see that the man had felled
Lejaune from behind.</p>

<p>Gronau had released the muzzles of the rifles, they had
crashed down on the roof, and he was standing pointing,
staring, his silly eyes goggling and his silly mouth wide
open.</p>

<p>So obviously was he stricken by some strange vision,
that Lejaune, instead of knocking him down, turned to look
in the direction of his pointing hand.</p>

<p>I did the same.</p>

<p><i>The oasis was swarming with Arabs, swiftly and silently
advancing to attack!</i></p>

<p>Even as I looked, a huge horde of camel-riders swept out
to the left, another to the right, to make a detour and
surround the fort on all sides. There were hundreds and
hundreds of them already in sight, even in that poor light
of early dawn.</p>

<p>Lejaune showed his mettle instantly.</p>

<p>"Run like Hell," he barked at Gronau. "Back with those
rifles," and sent him staggering with a push. "Send
Sergeant Dupré here, quick."</p>

<p>"Down to the barrack-room," he snapped at me. "Give the
alarm. Take this key to St. André and issue the rifles.
Send me the bugler. Jump, or I'll..."</p>

<p>I jumped.</p>

<p>Even as I went, Lejaune's rifle opened rapid fire into
the advancing hordes.</p>

<p>Rushing down the stairs and along the passage, I threw
the key to St. André, who was standing like a graven image
at the door of the magazine.</p>

<p>"<i>Arabs!</i>" I yelled. "Out with the rifles and
ammunition!"</p>

<p>Dashing on, I came to the door of the barrack-room.</p>

<p>Michael was pointing his rifle at Boldini's head. Maris
was covering Schwartz, and Cordier was wavering the muzzle
of his rifle over the room generally. Everybody was awake,
and there was a kind of whispered babel, over which rose
Michael's clear and cheerful:</p>

<p>"Show a foot anybody who wants to die...."</p>

<p>Nobody showed a foot, though all seemed to show
resentment, especially Boldini, with a loaded rifle a yard
from his ear.</p>

<p>Taking this in at a glance, I halted, drew breath
and then bawled, "<i>Aux armes! Aux armes! Les Arbis! Les
Arbis!</i>" and, with a shout to Michael and the other two,
of:</p>

<p>"<i>Up with you&mdash;we're surrounded,</i>" I turned to dash
back, conscious of a surge of unclad men from the beds,
as their gaolers rushed after me. Whoops and yells of joy
pursued us, and gleeful howls of:</p>

<p>"<i>Aux armes! Les Arbis!</i>" as the delighted men snatched
at their clothes.</p>

<p>St. André staggered towards us beneath a huge bundle of
rifles.</p>

<p>Dupré and the guard were clattering up the stairs.</p>

<p>As we rushed out on to the roof, Lejaune roared:</p>

<p>"Stand to! Stand to! Open fire at once! Rapid fire! Give
them Hell, you devils! Give them Hell!" and, ordering Dupré
to take command of the roof, he rushed below.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later, a constant trickle of men
flowed up from below, men in shirt-sleeves, men bareheaded
and barefooted, men in nothing but their trousers&mdash;but
every man with a full cartridge-pouch and his rifle and
bayonet.</p>

<p>Lejaune must have worked like a fiend, for within a few
minutes of Gronau's dropping of the rifles, every man in
the fort was on the roof, and from every embrasure rifles
poured their magazine-fire upon the yelling, swarming
Arabs.</p>

<p>It had been a very near thing. A very close shave
indeed.</p>

<p>But for Gronau's coming up and diverting attention from
the inside of the fort to the outside, there probably would
not have been a man of the garrison alive in the place by
now&mdash;except those of the wounded sufficiently alive to
be worth keeping for torture.</p>

<p>One wild swift rush in the half-light, and they would
have been into the place&mdash;to find what? A disarmed
garrison!</p>

<p>As I charged my magazine and fired, loaded and fired,
loaded and fired, I wondered if these things were "chance,"
and Gronau's arrival and idle glance round, at the last
moment that gave a chance of safety, pure accidental
coincidence.</p>

<p>A near thing indeed&mdash;and the issue yet in doubt,
for it was a surprise attack. They had got terribly close,
the oasis was in their hands, and there were many hundreds
of them to our little half-company.</p>

<p>And they were brave. There was no denying that, as they
swarmed up to the walls under our well-directed rapid-fire,
an Arab falling almost as often as a legionary pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>While hundreds, along each side, fired at our embrasures
at a few score yards' range, a large band attacked the
gate with stones, axes, heavy swords, and bundles of
kindling-wood to burn it down.</p>

<p>Here Lejaune, exposing himself fearlessly, led the
defence, controlling a rapid volley-fire that had terrible
effect, both physical and moral, until the whole attack
ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and the Touaregs, as
the sun rose, completely vanished from sight, to turn the
assault into a siege and to pick us off, in safety, from
behind the crests of the sand-hills.</p>

<p>I suppose this whirlwind dawn attack lasted no more than
ten minutes from the moment that the first shot was fired
by Lejaune, but it had seemed like hours to me.</p>

<p>I had shot at least a score of men, I thought. My rifle
was hot and sweating grease, and several bullets had struck
the deep embrasure in which I leaned to fire.</p>

<p>Below, the plain was dotted over with little heaps of
white or blue clothing, looking more like scattered bundles
of "washing" than dead ferocious men who, a minute before,
had thirsted and yelled for the blood of the infidel, and
had fearlessly charged to drink it.</p>

<p>Our bugler blew the "Cease fire," and on the order,
"Unload! Stand easy," I looked round as I straightened
myself up, unloaded my rifle, and stood at ease.</p>

<p>It was a strange sight.</p>

<p>At every embrasure there was a caricature of a
soldier&mdash;in some cases almost naked&mdash;at his feet
a litter of spent cartridges, and, in one or two instances,
a pool of blood. As I looked, one of these wild figures,
wearing nothing but a shirt and trousers, slowly sank to
the ground, sat a moment and then collapsed, his head
striking with a heavy thud. It was Blanc, the sailor.</p>

<p>Lejaune strode over from his place in the middle of the
roof.</p>

<p>"Here," he shouted. "No room nor time, yet, for
shirkers," and putting his arms round the man, dragged
him from the ground and jerked him heavily into the
embrasure.</p>

<p>There he posed the body, for Blanc appeared to be dead.
Into the embrasure it leaned, chest on the upward sloping
parapet, and elbows wedged against the outer edges of the
massive uprights of the crenellation.</p>

<p>Lejaune placed the rifle on the flat top of the
embrasure, a dead hand under it, a dead hand clasped round
the small of the butt, the heel-plate against the dead
shoulder, a dead cheek leaning against the butt.</p>

<p>"Continue to look useful, my friend, if you can't <i>be</i>
useful," he jeered; and as he turned away, he added:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll see that route to Morocco if you stare
hard enough."</p>

<p>"Now then, Corporal Boldini," he called, "take every
third man below, get them fed and properly dressed, and
double back here if you hear a shot, or the 'Assembly'
blown. If there's no attack, take below one-half of the
rest.... Then the remainder.... Have all <i>klim-bim</i> and
standing-to again in thirty minutes.... You, St. André,
and Maris, more ammunition. A hundred rounds per man....
Cordier, pails of water. Fill all water-flasks and then
put filled pails there above the gate.... They may try
another bonfire against it.... Sergeant Dupré, no wounded
whatsoever will go below. Bring up the medical panniers....
Are all prisoners out of the cells?"...</p>

<p>He glared around, a competent, energetic, courageous
soldier. "And where's the excellent Schwartz?" he went
on. "Here, you dog, up on to that look-out platform and
watch those palm trees&mdash;till the Arabs get you....
Watch that oasis, I say.... You'll have a little while up
there for the thinking out of some more plots...." And he
laid his hand on the butt of his revolver, as he scowled
menacingly at the big German.</p>

<p>Schwartz sprang up the ladder leading to the high
look-out platform that towered far above the roof of the
fort. It was the post of danger.</p>

<p>"Now use your eyes, all of you," bawled Lejaune, "and
shoot as soon as you see anything to shoot at."</p>

<p>Ten minutes or so later, Boldini returned with the men
whom he had taken below, now all dressed as for morning
parade. They took their places and the Corporal hurried
round the roof, touching each alternate man on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Fall out, and go below," he ordered.</p>

<p>Ten minutes or so later they were back, fed, clothed,
and in their right minds. Gone like magic were all signs
of <i>cafard,</i> mutiny, and madness. These were eager, happy
soldiers, revelling in a fight.</p>

<p>With the third batch I went, hoping to be back before
anything happened. Not a rifle-shot broke the stillness, as
we hastily swallowed <i>soupe</i> and coffee, and tore at our
bread.</p>

<p>"Talk about 'They came to curse and remained to pray,'"
murmured Michael, with bulging cheeks. "These jolly old
Arabs removed our curse and remained for us to slay.
There'll be no more talk of mutiny for a while."</p>

<p>"Nor of anything else, old bean," I replied, "if they
remain to prey."</p>

<p>"Never get in here," said Michael. "They couldn't take
this place without guns."</p>

<p>"Wonder what they're doing?" I mused.</p>

<p>"Diggin' themselves in on the crests of the sand-hills,"
said Michael. "They can't rush us, so they're going to do
some fancy shooting."</p>

<p>"Yes. What about a regular siege?" I asked. "And killing
only one of us to a score of them that we kill! We should
be too few to man the four walls eventually."</p>

<p>"What about relief from Tokotu?" suggested Michael.</p>

<p>"Over a hundred miles away!" I replied, "and no wires.
Nor any chance to heliograph across a level desert, even if
they could see so far."</p>

<p>"Chance for the <i>médaille militaire,</i>" grinned Michael.
"Go to Lejaune and say, '<i>Fear not! Alone I will walk
through the encircling foe and bring you relief.</i>' Then you
walk straight through them, what?"</p>

<p>"Might be done at night," I mused.</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> think," said Michael. "These merry men will
sit round the place in a circle like a spiritualists'
<i>séance,</i> holding hands, rather than let anyone slip
through them."</p>

<p>"Full moon too," I observed. "Anyhow, I'm very grateful
to the lads for rolling up...."</p>

<p>"Shame to shoot 'em," agreed Michael, and then Boldini
hounded us all back to the roof, and we resumed our
stations.</p>

<p>All was ready, and the Arabs could come again as soon as
they liked.</p>

<p>Lejaune paced round and round the roof like a tiger in a
cage.</p>

<p>"Hi you, there!" he called up to Schwartz. "Can you see
nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing moving, <i>mon Adjudant,</i>" replied Schwartz.</p>

<p>A moment later he shouted something, and his voice was
drowned in the rattle and crash of a sudden outbreak of
rifle fire in a complete circle all round the fort. The
Arabs had lined the nearest sand-hills on all sides of
us, and lying flat below the crests, poured in a steady
independent fire.</p>

<p>This was a very different thing from their first mad
rush up to the very walls, when they hoped to surprise a
sleeping fort and swarm up over the walls from each other's
shoulders.</p>

<p>They were now difficult to see, and a man firing from
his embrasure was as much exposed as an Arab lying flat
behind a stone or in a trench scooped in the sand.</p>

<p>There was a man opposite to me, about a hundred yards
distant, who merely appeared as a small black blob every
few minutes. He must have been lying on a slope or in a
shallow sand trench, and he only showed his head for a few
seconds when he fired. I felt that either he or I would get
hurt, sooner or later, for he, among others, was potting at
my embrasure.</p>

<p>It was certainly "fancy shooting" as Michael had said,
waiting for the small object, a man's head, to appear for
five seconds at a hundred yards' range, and get a shot at
it. It was certainly interesting too, and more difficult
than rifle-range work, for one's nerves are not steadied
nor one's aim improved by the knowledge that one is also
being shot at oneself, and by several people.</p>

<p>With unpleasant frequency there was a sharp blow on
the wall near my embrasure and sometimes the high wailing
song of a ricochet, as the deflected and distorted bullet
continued its flight at an angle to the line of its
arrival.</p>

<p>The morning wore on and the sun gained rapidly in
power.</p>

<p>Unreasonably and unreasoningly I did not expect to be
hit, and I was not hit, but I was increasingly conscious of
the terrific heat and of a severe headache. I wondered if
high nervous tension made one more susceptible, or whether
the day was really hotter than usual....</p>

<p>Suddenly, the man on my right leapt back, shouted, spun
round and fell to the ground, his rifle clattering at my
feet.</p>

<p>I turned and stooped over him. It was the wretched
Guantaio, shot through the middle of his face.</p>

<p>As I bent down, I was suddenly sent crashing against the
wall, as Lejaune literally sprang at me.</p>

<p>"By God!" he roared. "You turn from your place again
and I'll blow your head off! <i>Duty,</i> you dog! Get to your
duty! What have you to do with this carrion, you cursed,
slinking, cowering, hiding shirker..." and as I turned
back into my embrasure, he picked up the choking, moaning
Guantaio and flung him into the place from where he had
fallen.</p>

<p>"Stay there, you rotten dog," he shouted, "and if you
slide out of it, I'll <i>pin</i> you up with bayonets through
you," and he forced the dying wretch into the embrasure so
that he was wedged in position, with his head and shoulders
showing through the aperture between the crenellations on
either side of him.</p>

<p>"I'll have no skulking malingerers here," he roared.
"You'll all stay in those embrasures alive or <i>dead,</i> while
there's an Arab in sight...."</p>

<p>Suddenly the Arab fire dwindled and slackened and
then ceased. Either they had had enough of our heavy and
accurate fire, or else some new tactics were going to be
introduced. I imagined that a camel-man had ridden all
round the sand-hills, out of sight, calling the leaders to
colloquy with the Emir in command.</p>

<p>Our bugles sounded the "Cease fire."</p>

<p>"Stand easy!... Wounded lie down where they are," rang
out Lejaune's voice, and some half-dozen men sank to the
ground in their own blood. I was thankful to see that
Michael was not among them.</p>

<p>Sergeant Dupré with Cordier, who had been a doctor, went
to each in turn, with bandages and stimulants.</p>

<p>"Corporal Boldini," barked Lejaune, "take the men down
in three batches. Ten minutes for <i>soupe</i> and a half-litre
of wine each. Come back at the '<i>pas gymnastique</i>' if
you hear the 'Assembly' blown.... St. André, replenish
ammunition. Each man to have a hundred.... Stop that
bandaging, Cordier, and stir yourself...."</p>

<p>When my turn came, later, to go below, I was more
thankful for the comparative darkness and coolness of the
<i>caserne</i> than for the <i>soupe</i> and wine even, for my head
was splitting.</p>

<p>"'<i>Moriturus te saluto,</i>'" said Cordier, as he raised
his mug of wine.</p>

<p>"Don't talk rot," said I. "You're no more <i>moriturus</i>
than&mdash; <i>Madame la République.</i>"</p>

<p>"I shall be dead before sunset," replied Cordier.
"This place will be a silent grave shortly... ' <i>Madame
la République&mdash;morituri te salutant!</i>' <i>...</i>" and he
drank again.</p>

<p>"He's fey," said Michael. "Anyhow, better to die
fighting than to be done in by Lejaune afterwards.... If I
go, I'd like to take that gentle <i>adjudant</i> with me...."</p>

<p>"He's a topping soldier," I said.</p>

<p>"Great," agreed Michael. "Let's forgive him."</p>

<p>"We will, if he dies," said I. "I am afraid that he'll
see to it that he <i>needs</i> some forgiving, if he and we
survive this show, and he gets control again...."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Michael. "Do you know, I believe he's torn
both ways when a man's hit. The brute in him says, '<i>That's
one for you, you damned mutineer,</i>' and the soldier in him
says, '<i>One more of a tiny garrison gone.</i>'"</p>

<p>"He's a foul brute," I agreed. "He absolutely
<i>flung</i> two wounded, suffering men back into their
embrasures&mdash;and enjoyed doing it."</p>

<p>"Partly enjoyment and partly tactics," said Michael
wiping his lips, and lighting a cigarette. "He's going to
give the Arabs the idea that not a man has been killed. Or
else that he has so many men in the fort that another takes
the place of each one that falls.... The Touaregs have
no field-glasses, and to them a man in an embrasure is a
man...."</p>

<p>"What about when there are too few to keep up any volume
of fire?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He may hope for relief before then," hazarded
Michael.</p>

<p>"He does," put in St. André, who had just joined
us and taken a seat at the table. "Dupré told me so.
The wily beggar has kept the two <i>goums</i> outside every
night lately&mdash;presumably ever since he knew of the
conspiracy. They had orders to go, hell for leather, to
Tokotu, and say the fort was <i>attacked,</i> the moment they
heard a rifle fired, <i>inside or out.</i>"</p>

<p>"By Jove!" I exclaimed. "Of course! He wouldn't send
to Tokotu to ask for help in quelling a mutiny of his own
men, before it happened&mdash;but he wouldn't mind a column
arriving because a <i>goum</i> had erroneously reported an
attack on the fort."</p>

<p>"Cunning lad!" agreed Michael. "And he knew that when
the conspiracy was about to bloom and he nipped it in the
bud, he'd be pretty shorthanded after it, if he should be
attacked&mdash;even by a small raiding party out for a
lark!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cordier. "He saved his face and he saved
the fort too. If a shot had been fired at the mutineers,
the <i>goums</i> would have scuttled off as ordered, and the
relief-column from Tokotu would have found an heroic
Lejaune cowing and guarding a gang of mutineers.... As it
is, they'll know to-morrow morning, at Tokotu, that the
place is invested, and they'll be here the next day."</p>

<p>"Question is&mdash;where shall <i>we</i> be by then!" I
observed.</p>

<p>"In Hell, dear friends," smiled Cordier.</p>

<p>"Suppose the <i>goums</i> were chopped in the oasis!" said
Michael. "Taken by surprise, as we were."</p>

<p>"What I said to Dupré!" replied Cordier. "But Lejaune
was too old a bird. They camped in the oasis by day, but
were ordered to be out at night, and patrol separately,
one north to south on the east and the other on the west,
a half-circle each, from sunset to sunrise, Dupré says...
Likely they'd have been chopped in the oasis in the daytime
all right, sound asleep&mdash; but they wouldn't be caught
at dawn. They were well outside the enveloping movement
from the oasis when the Arabs surrounded the place, and
the <i>goums</i> would be off to Tokotu at the first shot or
sooner.... By the time..."</p>

<p>"Up with you," shouted Boldini, and we hurried back to
the roof and resumed our stations. The wounded were again
in their places, one or two lying very still in them,
others able to stand.</p>

<p>On either side of me, a dead man stood wedged into his
embrasure, his rifle projecting before him, his elbows and
the slope of the parapet keeping him in position.</p>

<p>I could see no sign of life from my side of the fort.
Nothing but sand and stones over which danced the blinding
aching heat-haze.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a cry from Schwartz on the look-out
platform.</p>

<p>"The palms," he shouted and pointed. "They're climbing
them." He raised his rifle and fired.</p>

<p>Those were his last words. A volley rang out a minute
later, and he fell.</p>

<p>Bullets were striking the wall against which I stood,
upon its <i>inner</i> face. Arab marksmen had climbed to the
tops of the palms of the oasis, and were firing down upon
the roof. From all the sand-hills round, the circle of fire
broke out again.</p>

<p>"Rapid fire at the palms," shouted Lejaune. "Sergeant
Dupré, take half the men from the other three sides to that
one. Bring those birds down from their trees quickly....
Brandt, up with you on to the look-out platform.
Quick...."</p>

<p>I glanced round as I charged my magazine afresh. Brandt
looked at the platform and then at Lejaune. Lejaune's hand
went to the revolver in the holster at his belt, and Brandt
climbed the ladder, and started firing as quickly as he
could work the bolt of his rifle.</p>

<p>Michael was still on his feet, but, as I turned back, I
saw his neighbour spin round and crash down, clutching with
both streaming hands at his throat.</p>

<p>When I took another swift glance later, the man had been
wedged into the embrasure and posed by Lejaune as a living
defender of the fort.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards I heard a shout from above, and turning,
saw Brandt stagger backwards on the high platform. He
struck the railing, toppled over, and came with a horrible
crash to the roof.</p>

<p>"Find a good place for that carrion, Sergeant Dupré,"
shouted Lejaune. "Make him ornamental if he can't be
useful."</p>

<p>I then heard him call the name of Haff.</p>

<p>"Up you go, Haff," he shouted. "You're another of these
brave <i>risque touts.</i> Up you go!"</p>

<p>Schwartz, Brandt, Haff! Doubtless the next would
be Delarey and Vogué.... And then Colonna, Gotto, and
Bolidar.... Guantaio was dead.... Why didn't he send
Michael up there? Presumably he hoped to keep him, St.
André, Cordier, Maris, and me alive until the mutineer
ringleaders and the diamond-stealers were dead.... He
wouldn't want to be left victorious over the Arabs, only to
find himself defenceless in the hands of the mutineers and
the thieves.</p>

<p>I glanced up at Haff and saw that he was lying behind
Schwartz's body, and firing over it as though it were a
parapet along the edge of the platform.</p>

<p>I wondered how long this second phase of the fight
had lasted, and whether we could hold out till night
fell and the Arabs could not see to shoot.... Would
they shoot by moonlight? It was unlikely, the Arab
being, as a rule, averse from any sort of night work
except peaceful travelling. A dawn rush is his favourite
man&oelig;uvre....</p>

<p>It was agony to fire my rifle, for my head ached with
one of those terrible eye-strain heat-stroke pains that
give the feeling that the head is opening and shutting,
exposing the brain. Every explosion of my rifle was like a
blow on the head with a heavy hammer. I had almost come to
the end of my tether when once again the fire of the Arabs
slackened and dwindled and died away.</p>

<p>On the "Cease fire" bugle being ordered by Lejaune, I
straightened up. I looked round as the words, "Unload!
Stand easy!" rang out.</p>

<p>Michael was all right, but a good half of the garrison
was dead or dying, for quite half the men remained partly
standing, partly lying, wedged into their embrasures as the
others obeyed the orders shouted by Lejaune.</p>

<p>Among the dead were both Sergeant Dupré and Corporal
Boldini, and both had been stuck up to simulate living men.
Haff must be dead too, for Delarey had been sent up to
the platform, and was lying flat behind a little pile of
bodies.</p>

<p>St. André was alive, for Lejaune called out:</p>

<p>"St. André, take rank as Corporal. One half the men to
go below for <i>soupe</i> and coffee. Double back quick if you
hear the 'Assembly' blown..." and St. André passed round
the roof, touching each alternate man of those who were
standing up, and saying, "Fall out, and go below."</p>

<p>In many embrasures was a man whom he did not touch.</p>

<p>Poor Cordier had spoken truly as concerned his own fate,
for he remained at his post, staring out with dead eyes
across the desert.</p>

<p>Maris was dead too. There were left three men&mdash;St.
André, Michael, and myself, upon whom Lejaune could rely
if the Arabs now drew off and abandoned the siege of the
fort.</p>

<p>But this, the Arabs did not do.</p>

<p>Leaving a circle of what were presumably their best
marksmen, to pick off any of the defenders of the fort who
showed themselves, the bulk of them retired out of sight
behind the oasis and sand-hills beyond it.</p>

<p>By Lejaune's orders, the embrasures were occupied only
by the dead, the living being ordered below in small
parties, for rest and food.</p>

<p>St. André was told to see that every man left his bed
and <i>paquetage</i> as tidy as for inspection, and that the
room was in perfect order. Lejaune himself never left the
roof, but had <i>soupe,</i> coffee, and wine brought up to
him.</p>

<p>To the look-out platform he sent Vogué to join the
bodies of his fellow-conspirators, Schwartz, Haff, and
Delarey.</p>

<p>Except for a crouching sentry in the middle of each
wall of the roof, those who were not below, feeding and
resting, sat with their backs to the wall, each beside his
embrasure.</p>

<p>The fire of the Arab sharpshooters did no harm, and they
wasted their ammunition on dead men.</p>

<p>And so the evening came and wore away and the moon
rose.</p>

<p>Where we were, we lay, with permission to sleep, St.
André having the duty of seeing that two sentries patrolled
each wall and were changed every two hours.</p>

<p>By Lejaune's orders, Vogué, in the dusk before moonrise,
pushed the bodies of Schwartz, Haff, and Delarey from the
look-out platform to fall down to the roof. They were then
posed in embrasures, as though living defenders of the
fort. It seemed to give Lejaune special pleasure to thrust
his half-smoked cigarette between Schwartz's teeth, and
pull the dead man's <i>képi</i> rakishly to one side.</p>

<p>"There, my fine conspirator," said he when the body
was arranged to his liking. "Stand there and do your duty
satisfactorily for the first time in your life, now you're
dead. Much more useful now than ever you were before."</p>

<p>"He's a devil! He's a devil! He's mad&mdash;<i>mad!...</i>"
groaned Vogué as he dragged the body of Delarey past me.</p>

<p>"Up with him! Put him over there," growled Lejaune, when
Vogué had got the body in his arms. "I'll allot your corpse
the place next to his, and your pipe shall be stuck between
your teeth. You are fond of a pipe, friend Vogué! Helps you
to think out plots, eh?... Up with him, you dog..." and he
kept his hand on the butt of his revolver as he baited the
man. He then sent him back to the look-out platform, to be
a target for the Touaregs when the moon rose, or the sun,
if he lived to see it....</p>

<p>I had a talk with Michael when our turn came to go below
for a rest and food.</p>

<p>"Looks like a thin time to-morrow," said Michael. "If
they pot a few of us and then rush, they should get in."</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed. "They ought to keep up a heavy fire
while their ammunition lasts, and then charge on camels in
one fell swoop. And then climb up from the backs of the
camels. A lot would be killed but a bigger lot would get
in."</p>

<p>"Don't give them the tip, anyhow," grinned Michael. "Two
or three hundred of the devils inside the place, and it
would be a short life and a merry for the half-dozen or so
of us who were left by that time...."</p>

<p>"If we can stand them off to-morrow, the relief from
Tokotu ought to roll up the next morning," I said.</p>

<p>"If either of those <i>goums</i> got away and played the
game," agreed Michael. "They may have been pinched
though.... The relief will find a thin house here, if
they do come.... It'll mean a commission for Lejaune all
right."</p>

<p>"Nice if he's confirmed in command here, and we
survive!" I remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Michael, "and talking of which, look here,
old son. If I take the knock and you don't, I want you
to do something for me.... Something <i>most</i> important...
what?"</p>

<p>"You can rely on me, Beau," I said.</p>

<p>"I know I can, John," he replied. "There's some letters.
A funny <i>public</i> sort of letter, a letter for Claudia,
and one for you, and one for Digby, in my belt&mdash;and
there's a letter and a tiny packet for Aunt Patricia. If
you possibly can, old chap, get that letter and packet to
Aunt. No hurry about it&mdash;<i>but get it to her.</i> See?
<i>Especially the letter.</i> The packet doesn't much matter,
and it contains nothing of any value, but I'd die a lot
more comfortable if I knew that Aunt Patricia was going to
get that letter after my death...."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut it, Beau," I said roughly. "Your number's not
up yet. Don't talk rot."</p>

<p>"I'm only asking you to do something <i>if</i> I'm pipped,"
said Michael.</p>

<p>"And, of course, I'll do it if I'm alive," I replied....
"But suppose we're both killed?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;the things are addressed and stamped, and
it's usual to forward such letters and packets found on
dead soldiers, as you know. Depends on what happens....
If we die and Lejaune survives, I doubt their being
dispatched. Or rather, I don't doubt at all.... Or if
the Arabs get in, there's not much chance of anything
surviving.... But if we're both killed and the relief gets
in here before the Arabs do, the officer in charge would
do the usual thing.... Anyhow, we can only hope for the
best....</p>

<p>"Anything I can do for you if it's the other way round,
John?" he added.</p>

<p>"Well, love to Dig, you know, and there's a letter for
Isobel, and you might write to her if ever you get back to
civilisation and say we babbled of her, and sang, '<i>Just
before the battle, Mother,</i>' and '<i>Bring a flower from
Maggie's grave</i>' and all that...."</p>

<p>Michael grinned.</p>

<p>"I'll say the right things about you to Isobel, old
son," he said, "and if otherwise, you'll see that Aunt gets
my letter, eh? Be sure I'm dead though.... I mean if I were
captured alive by Arabs, or anything humorous like that, I
don't want her to get it while I'm alive.... Of course, all
five of the letters are important, but I <i>do</i> want Aunt to
get hers...."</p>

<p>And then St. André ordered our little party up to the
roof, and brought down the other one.</p>

<p>The Arabs had ceased their desultory firing, and might
have been a hundred miles away. Only the sight of a little
smoke from their camp-fires and the occasional scent of
the burning camel-dung and wood betrayed their presence,
for none were in sight, and they made no sound. No one
doubted, however, that a very complete chain of watchful
sentries ringed us round, and made it utterly impossible
for anyone to leave the fort and bring help to his besieged
comrades.</p>

<p>The fact that Lejaune sent no one to make the attempt
seemed to confirm the story that Dupré had told Cordier
as they bandaged the wounded, and to show that Lejaune
believed that the <i>goums</i> had got away.</p>

<p>It would be a wellnigh hopeless enterprise, but there
was just a chance in a thousand that a daring and skilful
scout might be able to crawl to where their camels were,
and get away on one. Nor was Lejaune the man to take any
count of the fact that it was almost certain torture and
death for the man who attempted it.</p>

<p>I decided that, on the one hand, he felt pretty sure the
<i>goums</i> had got away to Tokotu directly the Arabs appeared,
and that, on the other hand, the two or three men whom he
could trust were just the men whom he could not spare.</p>

<p>Unless St. André, Michael, and I were with him, his fate
would be the same whether he drove the Arabs off or not,
and doubtless he would rather go down fighting Arabs, than
be murdered by his own men.</p>

<p>I was ordered on duty as sentry, and, for two hours,
patrolled my side of the roof with my eyes on the moonlit
desert, where nothing moved and whence no sound came.</p>

<p>When relieved, I had a little chat with St. André after
he had posted my relief.</p>

<p>"Dawn will be the dangerous time; they'll rush us then,"
he said, "and it will want quick shooting to keep them
down if they come all together and on all four sides at
once. They must be a hundred to one.... I wonder if they'll
bring ropes and poles, or ride their camels right up to the
walls...."</p>

<p>"If they don't count the cost, I don't see how we can
keep them out," I said.</p>

<p>"Nothing could keep them out," replied St. André. "But
if they fail at dawn they won't try again until the next
dawn. They'll just pepper us all day and tire us out....
They think they have all the time they want."</p>

<p>"Haven't they?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied St. André. "Lejaune is certain that one of
the <i>goums</i> got away. The Arabs couldn't get them <i>both,</i>
he says, as they were at opposite sides of the fort, and
half a mile apart always, at night."</p>

<p>"What about their ammunition!" I asked. "The Touaregs',
I mean."</p>

<p>"The more they spend the more determined they'll be to
get ours, and the more likely to put their money on a swift
dawn-rush with cold steel...."</p>

<p>I lay down and fell asleep, to be awakened by the bugle
and Lejaune's shout of "<i>Stand to!</i>"</p>

<p>There was no sign of dawn and none of the Arabs.</p>

<p>From the centre of the roof, Lejaune addressed the
diminished garrison of Fort Zinderneuf.</p>

<p>"Now, my merry birds," said he, "you're going to
<i>sing,</i> and sing like the happy joyous larks you are.
We'll let our Arab friends know that we're not only awake,
but also merry and bright. Now then&mdash;the <i>Marching
Song of the Legion</i> first. All together, you warbling
water-rats&mdash;<i>Now.</i>" And led by his powerful bellow, we
sang at the tops of our voices.</p>

<p>Through the Legion's extensive repertoire he took us,
and between songs the bugler blew every call that he
knew.</p>

<p>"Now <i>laugh,</i> you merry, happy, jolly, care-free,
humorous swine. <i>Laugh....</i> You, Vogué, up there&mdash;roar
with laughter, or I'll make you roar with pain, by God....
Out with it. <i>Now....</i>"</p>

<p>A wretched laugh, like that of a hungry hyena, came down
from the look-out platform.</p>

<p>It was so mirthless a miserable cackle, and so
ludicrous, that we laughed genuinely.</p>

<p>"Again, you grinning dog," roared Lejaune. "Laugh till
your sides ache, you gibbering jackal. Laugh till the
tears run down your horrible face, you shivering she-ass.
Laugh!... <i>Now....</i>"</p>

<p>Again the hideous quavering travesty of a laugh rang
out, and the men below roared heartily at the ridiculous
noise.</p>

<p>"Now then, you twittering sniggering <i>soupe</i>-snatchers,
laugh in turn," shouted Lejaune. "From the right&mdash;you
start, Gotto."</p>

<p>Gotto put up a pretty good roar.</p>

<p>"Now beat <i>that,</i> next. Out with it, or, by God, I'll
give you something to laugh at," Lejaune continued.</p>

<p>And so round that circle of doomed men, among the dead
men, ran the crazy laughter, the doomed howling noisily,
the dead smiling secretly out to the illuminated silent
desert.</p>

<p>"Now all together with me," roared Lejaune, and great
guffaws rang out, desecrating the silence and the beauty of
the moonlit scene.</p>

<p>It was the maddest, most incredible business&mdash;that
horrible laughter among the dead, from men about to die.</p>

<p>Certainly the Arabs must have thought us mad and
certainly they were not far wrong. Anyhow, they knew we
were awake and must have gathered that we were cheerful and
defiant.</p>

<p>For Lejaune was justified of his madness, and no dawn
attack came.</p>

<p>Whether the Touaregs regarded us as "The afflicted of
Allah," and feared to rush the place, or whether they
realised that there could be no element of surprise in the
attack, I do not know, but it was never made.</p>

<p>And when the sun rose and they again lined the
sand-hills and opened their heavy fire upon the fort, every
embrasure was occupied by an apparently unkillable man, and
every Arab who exposed himself paid the penalty.</p>

<p>But not all those who lined the walls of Zinderneuf were
beyond scathe by Arab bullets. Now and then there would be
a cry, an oath, a gurgling grunt or cough, and a man would
stagger back and fall, or die where he crouched, a bullet
through his brain.</p>

<p>And, in every case, Lejaune would prop and pose
and arrange the body, dead or dying, in the embrasure
whence it had fallen, and to the distant Arab eyes it
must have seemed that the number of the defenders was
undiminished.</p>

<p>As the morning wore on, Lejaune took a rifle, and,
crouching beside each dead man in turn, fired several shots
from each embrasure, adding to the illusion that the dead
were alive, as well as to the volume of fire.</p>

<p>Later still, he set one man to each wall to do the same
thing, to pass continually up and down, firing from behind
the dead.</p>

<p>When the Arab fire again slackened and then ceased,
toward midday, and our bugle blew the "<i>Cease fire,</i>" I
hardly dared to turn round.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief, I saw Michael among the few who
rose from their embrasures at the order "<i>Stand easy.</i>"</p>

<p>It was a terribly tiny band. Of all those who had
sprung from their beds with cries of joy, at the shout
of "<i>Aux armes!</i>" yesterday morning, only Lejaune, St.
André, Michael, Colonna, Marigny, Vogué, Moscowski, Gotto,
Vaerren, and I were still alive.</p>

<p>The end was inevitable, unless relief came from Tokotu
before the Arabs assaulted the place. All they had to do
now, was to run in and climb. Ten men cannot hold back a
thousand.</p>

<p>If we survived to see the arrival of a relieving force
it would be the dead who saved us, these dead who gave the
impression of a numerous, fearless, ever-watchful garrison,
who would cause an attack across open ground to wither
beneath the blast of their rifles like grass beneath a
flame.</p>

<p>"Half the men below, for <i>soupe</i> and coffee and half
a litre of wine, Corporal St. André," ordered Lejaune.
"Back as soon as you can&mdash;or if the '<i>Assembly</i>' is
blown..." and St. André took each alternate man.</p>

<p>Soon coffee and <i>soupe</i> were ready, although the cook
was dead, and we sat at table as though in a dream,
surrounded by the tidy beds of dead men.</p>

<p>"Last lap!" said Michael, as I gave him a cigarette.
"Last cigarette! Last bowl of <i>soupe!</i> Last mug of coffee!
Last swig of wine! Well, well! It's as good an end as
any&mdash;if a bit early.... Look out for the letter,
Johnny," and he patted the front of his sash.</p>

<p>"Oh, come off it," I growled. "Last nothing. The relief
is half-way here by now."</p>

<p>"Hope so," replied Michael. "But I don't greatly care,
old son. So long as you see about the letter for me."</p>

<p>"Why <i>I,</i> rather than you, Beau?" I asked. "Just as
likely that you do my posting for me."</p>

<p>"Don't know, Johnny. Just feel it in my bones," he
replied. "I feel I'm in for it and you're not, and thank
the Lord for the latter, old chap," and he gave my arm a
little squeeze above the elbow. (His little grip of my
arm, and squeeze, had been one of my greatest rewards and
pleasures, all my life.)</p>

<p>As we returned to the roof at the end of our meal,
Michael held out his hand to me.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, dear old Johnny," he said. "I wish to
God I hadn't dragged you into this&mdash;but I think you'll
come out all right. Give my love to Dig."</p>

<p>I wrung his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Beau," I replied. "Or rather, <i>au</i>
'<i>voir....</i> Of course, you didn't 'drag' me into this. I
had as much right to assume the blame for the theft of the
'Blue Water' as you and Dig had.... And it's been a great
lark...."</p>

<p>He patted my shoulder as we clattered up the stairs.</p>

<p>Lejaune assigned one side of the roof to Michael and the
opposite one to me. Vogué and Vaerren respectively were
sent to the other two. Our orders were to patrol the wall
and shoot from behind a dead man, if we saw an Arab.</p>

<p>St. André took Colonna, Marigny, Moscowski, and Gotto
below.</p>

<p>Lejaune himself went up to the look-out platform with
his field-glasses and swept the horizon in the direction of
Tokotu. Apparently he saw no sign of help.</p>

<p>Nothing moved on the sand-hills on my side of the
fort, and I watched them over the heads of my dead
comrades....</p>

<p>How much longer could this last?</p>

<p>Would the Touaregs draw off from this
fort-with-an-inexhaustible-garrison?</p>

<p>Would the relief come in time! If not, would they be in
time to avenge us? It would be amusing if the Arabs, having
got into the fort, were caught in it by the Senegalese and
mounted troops from Tokotu&mdash;a poetic justice&mdash;for
not a man of them would escape!</p>

<p>Where <i>did</i> all the flies come from?... Horrible!...</p>

<p>St. André and his party returned to the roof, and now
two men were posted to each wall, St. André and Lejaune
remaining in the centre of the roof to support whichever
side of the fort should need it most when the attack
came.</p>

<p>When it did come, it was a repetition of the
siege-tactics and attrition warfare, a desultory fire of
sharpshooters, and most of it aimed at the dead.</p>

<p>Up and down his half of the wall, each of the defenders
hurried, firing from a different embrasure each time.</p>

<p>The Arabs must have been completely deceived, for
they came no nearer, and fired impartially at the silent
corpse-guarded embrasures and at those from which our eight
rifles cracked.</p>

<p>Glancing round, as I darted from one embrasure to
another, I saw that both Lejaune and St. André were in the
firing-line now, and that Lejaune had one wall of the fort
to himself. There were only seven of us left. Michael was
among them.</p>

<p>The Arab fire died down.</p>

<p>Lejaune himself picked up the bugle and sounded the
"<i>Cease fire.</i>" I saw that Vogué, Moscowski, and Marigny
were dead and propped up in their places. St. André was
dabbing his face with a rag, where a bullet had torn his
cheek and ear.</p>

<p>Colonna, Gotto, and I were sent below to get food, and
we spoke not a single word. When we returned, Michael,
Vaerren, and St. André went down in their turn.</p>

<p>Lejaune walked up and down the roof, humming "<i>C'est la
reine Pomaré,</i>" to all appearance cool and unconcerned.</p>

<p>Not an Arab was to be seen, and not a shot was fired.</p>

<p>I wondered whether they withdrew for meals or for
prayers&mdash;or whether they fired so many rounds per man
from their trenches on the sand-hills, and then awaited
their reliefs from the oasis.</p>

<p>Certainly it was a leisurely little war&mdash;on their
side; and no doubt they were well advised to conduct it so.
They must have lost terribly in their first attack, and
they had learnt wisdom.</p>

<p>A shot rang out.</p>

<p>"<i>Stand to!</i>" shouted Lejaune, and blew the "<i>Assembly</i>"
two or three times, as though calling up reserves from
below to the already well-manned walls.</p>

<p>That fort and its garrison must have been a sore puzzle
to the gentle Touareg.</p>

<p>The firing recommenced and grew hotter, and an ominous
change took place in the Arab tactics.</p>

<p>While a heavy fire was maintained from the crests of
the sand-hills, men crawled forward <i>en tirailleur</i> and
scratched shallow holes in the sand, behind stones....
Nearer and nearer they came.... They were going to assault
again.</p>

<p>I rushed from embrasure to embrasure, up and down my
side of the roof, pausing only just long enough to bring my
fore-sight on to an Arab. Time after time I saw that I hit
one of the running or crouching crawling figures drawing
ever closer to the wall.</p>

<p>Lejaune was like a man possessed, loading and firing,
dashing from place to place, and rushing from one side
of the fort to the other, to empty the magazine of his
rifle....</p>

<p>Why from one side to the other?... As I loaded and
fired, emptied and recharged my magazine, I found myself
asking this question.</p>

<p>Glancing round, I saw the reason. There was no one
defending the two walls that ran to left and right of
mine.</p>

<p>Lejaune was firing a burst from one, and then dashing
across to the other--defending two walls at once.</p>

<p>Only one man was defending the wall behind me. Swiftly I
looked across.</p>

<p><i>It was not Michael...</i>.</p>

<p>Only Lejaune, St. André, and I were on our feet.</p>

<p>This was the end....</p>

<p><i>Michael was gone</i>&mdash;but I should follow him in a
minute.</p>

<p>Cramming another clip of cartridges into my hot rifle, I
looked across again.</p>

<p>The opposite wall was now undefended.</p>

<p>Rushing across the roof from left to right, Lejaune
shouted:</p>

<p>"Both walls, damn you! To and fro, curse you! Shoot
like hell, blast you!" and I dashed across and emptied my
magazine from that side, a shot from a different embrasure
each time.</p>

<p>Back again I ran, and got off a burst of fire along the
opposite wall.</p>

<p>And so Lejaune and I <i>(Lejaune and I!)</i> held Fort
Zinderneuf for a while, two against a thousand.</p>

<p>And when I was nearly spent, panting like a hunted fox,
dripping with sweat, and nearly blind with eye-strain and
headache, the Arab fire again dwindled and died, and there
was perfect silence&mdash;an incredible dreadful silence,
after those hours of deafening racket.</p>

<p>"Go below, you, quick!" shouted Lejaune, pointing to
the stairs. "Boil coffee and <i>soupe,</i> and bring them here.
Double back, quick, the moment a shot is fired. They may be
at us again in a few minutes.... If we keep them off till
dark, we're saved...."</p>

<p>"Hurry, you swine," he roared, as I stood staring at
where Michael lay on his face in a pool of blood.</p>

<p>I dragged myself to the stairs as Lejaune cursed me.</p>

<p>As I went down them I heard him merrily blowing the
"<i>Cease fire,</i>" and bawling fierce orders to imaginary
defenders of the fort.</p>

<p>I stumbled to the cook-house.</p>

<p>"<i>Keep them off till dark and we're saved,</i>" did he
say?</p>

<p>I hadn't the very faintest desire to be saved. Why
should I be saved when Michael lay there so still?</p>

<p>As I struck a match to light the oil-stove, I thought
I heard a shot. Rushing back up the stairs, I saw that
Lejaune was posing a corpse in an embrasure. One body still
lay where it had fallen.</p>

<p>It was Michael's.</p>

<p>I must have been mistaken as to hearing the sound of a
shot. At any rate all was silent now, and Lejaune, his back
to me, was fitting the dead man's rifle to his shoulder and
clasping the dead left hand round the barrel.</p>

<p>I turned and crept back to my duties as cook, placed
twigs and wood beneath the <i>soupe</i>-kettle, and turned up
the wick of the oil-stove....</p>

<p>And as I watched the fire burn up, I imagined Lejaune
posing Michael's body&mdash;perhaps long before life was
out of it.... The thought was unbearable.</p>

<p>He might be in agony.</p>

<p>He might be so wounded that his life could be saved
if he lay flat. Not all the killed had been killed
outright&mdash;though many of them had died immediately, as
only their heads were exposed and their wounds were in the
brain or throat.</p>

<p>There was really no more reason why Michael should be
spared than any of the others should be&mdash;but he was
my dearly-loved brother, and I simply could not bear it.
I could not have his poor wounded body flung about like a
sack of potatoes, and stuck up by the jeering Lejaune with
indignities and insults.</p>

<p>He might not yet be dead, and his life might depend on
what I did now! I turned to run upstairs.</p>

<p>Was I then going to mutiny after all? Was I going to
defy my superior officer and tell him what he should, and
what he should not, do in the fort that he commanded?</p>

<p>Was I going to tell him that Michael was of superior
clay and not to be treated as all the others had been
treated?</p>

<p>I was.</p>

<p>And as I ran up the stairs, another thought struck
me.</p>

<p>Michael's last request and instructions! I must get
those letters and the little packet that he had spoken
about. I must say to Lejaune:</p>

<p>"I'll fight till I drop, and I'll obey you
implicitly&mdash;but leave my brother's body
alone&mdash;leave it to me...."</p>

<p>After all, things were a little different now.</p>

<p>Lejaune and I were the only survivors. We had passed
through Hell unscathed, and, at the last, two against a
thousand, had kept the Flag flying.</p>

<p>Surely he could be decent now, unbend a little, and
behave as a man and a comrade....</p>

<p>As I came out on to the roof, Lejaune was bending over
Michael.</p>

<p>He had unfastened my brother's tunic, torn the lining
out of his <i>képi,</i> removed his sash, and opened the flat
pouch that formed part of the money-belt that Michael
wore.</p>

<p>Lying beside Lejaune, were three or four letters, and a
torn envelope. In his hands were a tiny packet, bound up in
string and sealing-wax, and an opened letter.</p>

<p>I sprang toward him, seeing red, my whole soul ablaze
with indignant rage that this foul vulturous thief should
rob the dead, rob a soldier who had fought beside him
thus&mdash;a brave man who had probably saved his life,
before the fight began.</p>

<p>"So he '<i>had no diamond,</i>' had he? Didn't know what
I meant, didn't he?" the ruffian jeered, holding up the
packet and the letter in his left hand.</p>

<p>"You damned thief! You foul pariah-dog!" I shouted, and,
in a second, his revolver was at my face.</p>

<p>"Stand back, you swine," he growled. "Back further.
Back, I say...."</p>

<p>One movement, and I should be dead.</p>

<p>And a good thing too, but I had a word or two to say
first. As I stepped back, he lowered the revolver and
smiled horribly....</p>

<p>"I didn't know that <i>men</i> crept round robbing the
dead, after a fight, Lejaune," I said. "I thought that
was left to Arab women&mdash;of the vilest sort.... You
dirty thieving cur&mdash;you should be picking over dust-
bins in the Paris gutters, not defiling an honourable
uniform&mdash;<i>chiffonnier!...</i>"</p>

<p>Lejaune bared his teeth and laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"A fine funeral oration from a jewel-thief!" he snarled.
"Any more grand sentiments before I blow out what brains
you have? No? Well, I think I promised you that I would
attend to you, all in good time. Now I'm going to do it....
I am going to shoot you now, where you stand. Half a dozen
through the stomach, shall we say? I don't want to hurry
you unduly out of this pleasant world.... Oh no, don't
think I want you any longer. The Arabs won't attack again
to-day, and they've settled all my mutineers nicely for
me.... And a relief-column will arrive at dawn.... Then
you and the rest of these cursed dogs will be given a hole
in the sand for the lot of you&mdash;and I shall get the
Cross of the Legion of Honour, a Captain's commission, and
a trip to Paris to receive thanks and decoration.... And
at Paris, my chatty little friend, I shall dispose of this
trifle that your gang so kindly brought to the Legion for
me!" and he again held up the little packet in his left
hand.</p>

<p>"A rich man, thanks to you&mdash;and to <i>this</i>..." and
as he said the last word, he actually kicked Michael's
body!</p>

<p>Even as I snatched at my sword-bayonet, and leapt
forward&mdash;in the instant that my dazed and weary
mind took in the incredible fact of this brutal
kick&mdash; it also took in another fact even more
incredible&mdash;<i>Michael's eyes were open, and turned to
me.</i></p>

<p>Michael was alive!... I would live too, if possible....
My hand, still grasping my bayonet, fell to my side.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lejaune. "Armed attack on a superior
officer&mdash;and in the face of the enemy!... Excellent! I
court martial you myself. I find you guilty and I sentence
you to <i>death....</i> I also carry out the sentence myself....
<i>Thus...</i>" and the revolver travelled slowly from my face
to the pit of my stomach.</p>

<p>"<i>There!...</i>"</p>

<p>As Lejaune had spoken, Michael's right hand had moved.
As the last word was uttered, the hand seized Lejaune's
foot, jerking him from his balance, as he pulled the
trigger in the act of looking down and of stumbling.</p>

<p>Blinded, deafened, and dazed, I leapt and lunged with
all my strength and drove my bayonet through Lejaune. I
stumbled, and it was torn from my hand. When I could see
again (for I must have ducked straight at the revolver as
he fired it, or else he must have raised it as his foot
was pulled from under him), he was lying on his back,
twitching, the handle of the bayonet protruding from his
chest, the blade through his heart.</p>

<p>Lejaune was dead, and <i>I</i> was the mutineer and murderer
after all! <i>I</i> was the "butcher" and <i>Lejaune</i> the
"pig."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch206" id="ch206">VI. &mdash; A "VIKING'S
FUNERAL"</a></h2>

<p class="poem">"All night long, in a dream untroubled of
hope,<br> He brooded, clasping his knees."</p><br>

<p class="first">I STOOPED over Michael, whose eyes were
closed again. Was he dead&mdash;his last act the saving of
my life?</p>

<p>I don't think I felt very much, at the moment. My mind
was numb or blank, and I wasn't certain that the whole
affair was not a nightmare....</p>

<p>Michael opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Stout Fella," he whispered. "Got the letters?"</p>

<p>I told him that he would deliver them in person. That we
were the sole survivors. That the relief would come soon
and we should be promoted and decorated.</p>

<p>"For stabbing Lejaune!" he smiled. "Listen, Johnny....
I'm for it, all right. Bled white.... Listen.... I never
stole anything in my life.... Tell Dig I said so, and <i>do</i>
get the letter to Aunt Patricia.... You mustn't wait for
the relief.... Lejaune's body.... They'd shoot you.... Get
a camel and save yourself.... In the dark to-night.... If
you can't get away, say I killed Lejaune.... I helped to,
anyhow..."</p>

<p>I do not know what I said.</p>

<p>"No. Listen.... Those letters.... You are to leave one
on me.... Leave it in my hand.... Confession.... Do the
thing thoroughly.... No need for you and Dig to carry on
with the game now.... You must get the confession published
or it's all spoilt...."</p>

<p>"You've nothing to confess, Beau, old chap," I said....
"Half a minute, I'm going to get some brandy...."</p>

<p>His fingers closed weakly on my sleeve.</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Johnny," he whispered. "Confession's
the whole thing.... Leave it where it'll be found or
I'll haunt you.... Gnaw your neck and go '<i>Boo</i>' in the
dark.... No, don't go.... Promise.... God! <i>I'm going
blind....</i> John... John.... Where are you?... Promise....
Confession.... John... John..."</p>

<p>Within two minutes of his seizing Lejaune's foot and
saving my life, my brother was dead.... My splendid, noble,
great-hearted Beau....</p>

<p>I have not the gift of tears. I have not cried since I
was a baby, and the relief of tears was denied me now.</p>

<p>No. I could not weep. But I looked at the revolver,
still clutched in Lejaune's right hand.... It was only
a momentary temptation, for I had something to do for
Michael. His last words had laid a charge on me, and I
would no more fail Michael dead, than I would have failed
him when he lived.</p>

<p>Michael's affairs first&mdash;and if the Touaregs rushed
the place while I attended to them, I would just take
Lejaune's revolver and make a good end. I ought to get five
of them, and perhaps might grab one of their heavy straight
swords and show them something....</p>

<p>I turned to the letters.</p>

<p>One of them was addressed to Lady Brandon. She should
get it, if I had the ingenuity, courage, and skill to keep
myself alive long enough. One was addressed to Claudia.
That too.... There was one for me, and one for Digby. And
there was another, crushed up in Lejaune's left hand.
The envelope from which he had torn it lay near. It was
addressed to <i>The Commissioner of Police, Scotland Yard,
London, England.</i> Poor Michael's "confession" of something
he had never done! I was sorely tempted to destroy it, but
his words were still in my ears, urgent and beseeching. <i>I
was to see that the</i> "<i>confession</i>" <i>was published.</i></p>

<p>Well&mdash;let it remain where it was. It would get a
wide-enough publicity if it were found in the dead hand
of the murdered Commandant of a beleaguered fort.... I
picked up the packet that Lejaune had dropped when I
struck him, and put it with the three letters into my
pocket. I then opened the one addressed to me. It ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear John</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">
When you get this, take the letters that are with it to
Brandon Abbas, as soon as you can. Send them if you can't
take them. The one for Aunt Patricia solves the Mystery of
the 'Blue Water,' at any rate to <u>her</u> satisfaction, and
she can publish the solution or not, as she thinks fit,
later on.... After Uncle Hector's death, for example....
Meanwhile, I beg and beseech and instruct and order you,
to see that the letter addressed to the Chief of Police is
not burked. It is exactly what we all bolted for&mdash;this
averting suspicion from innocent people (including your
Isobel, don't forget, Johnny boy!). We took the blame
between us, and the first of us to die should shoulder the
lot, of course, so that the other two can go home again.
You or Dig would do this for his brothers, and so will I,
if I pip first. So off with the home letters&mdash; HOME,
and see that the other one gets into the papers and into
the hands of the police and all that. I have written an
absolutely identical letter to this for Digby too, so I
am sure that one or both of you will see that my wishes
are carried out. No nonsense about '<span class="smcap">
DE MORTUIS NIL NISI BONUM</span>,' mind. It is the living
we have to think about, so do exactly as I tell you.
You'll be doing the best for me, as a matter of fact,
as well as for the living, if you carry out what I
ask&mdash;so <span class="smcap">GO TO IT, PUP</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">If I outlive you, I shall do the same by you or
Dig, <span class="smcap">SO GO TO IT</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">
You spoilt my plans by your balmy quixotic conduct in
bunking from home&mdash;now put them right by doing exactly
as I say.</p>

<p class="letter">
Good-bye, dear old stoutest of Stout Fellas. See you in
the Happy Hunting Grounds.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Beau</span>.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">P.S</span>.&mdash;Don't
come near me there, though, if you destroy that confession.</p>

<br>

<p>I put the letter down and looked at his face. Peaceful,
strong, dignified, and etherealised beyond its usual
fineness and beauty.... I closed his eyes and folded his
hands upon his chest....</p>

<p>How <i>could</i> I let this thing happen&mdash;let the world
have confirmation of the suspicion that Michael was a
despicable mean thief? Or rather, how could I publish to a
world that knew little or nothing about the affair, that
Michael had done such a miserable deed?</p>

<p>I looked at his face again.</p>

<p>How could I disobey his last instructions, refuse his
last request?</p>

<p>Nor was it a request made impulsively, on the spur
of the moment. He had thought it all out, and written
it down long ago, in case of just such an event as had
happened&mdash;his predeceasing us....</p>

<p>What would Digby do in my position? Would he take that
paper from Lejaune's hand and destroy it? I felt he would
not. He <i>could</i> not, had he been present at Michael's
death, and heard his dying words.... Not having done so,
would he blame me if I left that confession there, to be
found by the relieving force?</p>

<p>Well&mdash;if he did, he must, and I must act according
to my own light&mdash;if I could find any....</p>

<p>And suppose the Arabs assaulted again, before the relief
arrived?</p>

<p>That would settle the problem quite finally, for they
would loot the place, mutilate the dead, and then make the
fort the funeral pyre of the mangled corpses....</p>

<p>I found myself wishing they would do so, and then saw
the cowardice of my wish.</p>

<p>No, it was my affair now to&mdash;to&mdash;to... I
actually found that I was nodding, and had all but fallen
backwards as I sat!</p>

<p>In fact, a heavy faintness, an unspeakable weariness,
formed the only sensation of which my mind or body was now
conscious. I had seen too much, done too much, suffered too
much, felt too much, in the last few hours, to have any
other feeling left, save that of utter exhaustion. I felt
that I could die, but could not sleep.</p>

<p>In the very act of pulling myself together and saying
that <i>this</i> would not do, I must have fallen into a state
of semicoma that was not sleep.</p>

<p>I shook it off, to find that a new day was dawning,
and, for a minute, I gazed around at the extraordinary
sight that met my eyes&mdash;the bloodstained roof, the
mounds of cartridge-cases, the stiff figures crouching in
the embrasures, the body of Lejaune with the handle of
my bayonet protruding from his chest; and Michael's calm
smiling face, as noble in death as in life....</p>

<p>"I must go, Beau, old chap," I said aloud, "if I am to
get your letter and parcel to Aunt Patricia and tell them
of your heroic death."</p>

<p>I knelt and kissed him, for the first time since
babyhood.</p>

<p>And only then, actually not till then, I remembered the
Arabs!</p>

<p>There was no sign of them whatsoever, alive or dead,
which may partly account for my having completely forgotten
their existence....</p>

<p>I should not be doing much toward carrying out Michael's
wishes if I walked straight into their hands. Nor was death
any less certain if I remained in the fort till relief
came, and Lejaune's body was found with my bayonet in
it.</p>

<p>Idly I supposed that I might remove it and replace it
by that of another man, and blame him for the murder. I
had not the faintest intention of doing so, of course, nor
would my tale have been very convincing, since I was alive
and everybody else neatly disposed and arranged, <i>after</i>
death. It did occur to me that perhaps I could pretend
that I was the hero of the whole defence, and had posed
all these corpses myself, including that of the man who
had murdered Lejaune, but, of course, I did not seriously
consider the idea.</p>

<p>No. Unless I wanted to die, I must evade both the Arabs
and the relieving force from Tokotu. If I could do that,
I must, thereafter, evade the entire population of the
desert between Zinderneuf and safety, as well as evading
any avenging search-party that might be sent out after me.
There were also the little matters of thirst, starvation,
and exposure. All I could do in the way of preparation in
that direction would be to load myself with food, water,
spare boots, and ammunition.</p>

<p>Rising to my feet, I wearily dragged myself down the
stairs and filled and relit the oil-stove. While the
kettle was boiling for coffee, I foraged round, filled my
water-bottle with water and three big wine-bottles with the
same liquid. Water was going to be infinitely more precious
than any wine, before I was much older. I also emptied my
knapsack and haversack of everything but a pair of boots,
and filled them to bursting, with bread, coffee, and the
bottles of water.</p>

<p>I thought my best plan would be to load myself up to the
weight I was accustomed to, but to let my burden consist
of food and water. This would grow lighter as I grew
weaker&mdash;or I should grow weaker as it grew lighter.
Anyhow, it seemed the best thing to do, but how I longed
for a camel! The thought occurred to me that if the relief
did not arrive that day, I could remain in the fort till
night, and then try to get one of the Arabs' camels when
it was dark. A moment's reflection, however, made it clear
that if the relief did not enter the fort pretty soon, the
Arabs would.</p>

<p>The sooner I got away, the better chance I should have
of doing it successfully.</p>

<p>I ate and drank all I could, shouldered my burdens and
returned to the roof for a last look round. If I could
see anything of the Arabs in one direction I could, at
least, try to get away in the opposite quarter. If not, I
must simply trust to luck, and crawl off in the direction
opposite to the oasis, as being the likeliest one to offer
a chance of escape.</p>

<p>I gazed round in all directions. There still was no
sign of an Arab, though, of course, there might have been
any number beyond the oasis, or behind the sand-hills that
surrounded the fort.</p>

<p>I glanced at Lejaune. Should I remove my bayonet from
its place in his evil heart?</p>

<p>No. My whole soul revolted from the idea.... And as for
any hope of concealing the manner of his death, it would
still be perfectly obvious that he had been stabbed by a
comrade and not shot by the enemy.</p>

<p>Besides, I had killed him in
self-defence&mdash;self-defence from as cold-blooded,
dastardly, and criminal a murder as a man could commit.</p>

<p>No. Let the righteously-used bayonet stay where it
was&mdash;and incidentally I had quite enough to carry
without the now useless thing....</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Beau," I said, crossing to where he
lay&mdash;and, as I spoke, I almost jumped, for the
brooding silence was broken by a shot, followed by several
others....</p>

<p>The Arabs?... No&mdash;these were neither rifle shots
nor fired towards the fort. The sound of them made that
quite evident.</p>

<p>Crouching, I ran to the side of the roof and looked.</p>

<p>On a distant sand-hill was a man on a camel, a man in
uniform, waving his arm above his head and firing his
revolver in the air.</p>

<p>It was a French officer.</p>

<p>The relief had arrived from Tokotu, and I must escape or
be tried, and shot, for the murder of my superior officer
in the very presence of the enemy....</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;but what about this same enemy? Where were
they? Was that fine fellow riding to death and torture?
Straight into an ambush, a trap of which the uncaptured
fort with its flying flag was the bait? That might well be
the explanation of there having been no dawn-assault that
morning, while I slept. They might, with Arab cunning, have
decided that it would be a much better plan to maintain the
siege, unseen and unheard, and lure the relieving force, by
an appearance of peace and safety, into marching gaily into
an oasis covered by hundreds of rifles lining neighbouring
sand-hills. They could massacre the relief-column and then
turn to the fort again. If no relief-force came, they could
still assault the fort whenever they thought fit....</p>

<p>As these thoughts flashed through my mind, I decided
that I must warn that man, riding gaily to his death,
deceived by the peaceful quiet of the scene, and the
floating Tri-couleur at the flagstaff top. Seeing the walls
lined, as they were, with soldiers, the Flag floating above
them, and no sign of any enemy, he would at once conclude
that we had long since driven them off.</p>

<p>Obviously this must be the case, or he would have heard
sounds of rifle-fire, miles away, he would think.</p>

<p>I must warn him, for I had no doubt, in my own mind,
that hundreds of Arab eyes were watching him.</p>

<p>Nor was it this man alone, rejoicing there in our
safety. A whole column must be close behind him. Comrades
of ours who had marched day and night to our relief. Of
course, I could not let them walk into the trap, deceived
by the very ruse that had deceived the Arabs....</p>

<p>This officer was no fool, doubtless, but how was he to
know that the fort was a whited sepulchre, tenanted by the
dead, unable to signal to him that he was walking into an
ambush with his column? Naturally he would assume, that
since the apparently crowded fort gave him no warning of
danger, there <i>was</i> no danger, and he and his column could
come gaily marching into the fort from which its foes had
fled.</p>

<p>This being so, I must warn him myself. I was certain
that Michael would approve, and that he would have done
so himself had he been in my place. It might mean death
instead of escape, but death was certainly preferable to
sneaking off while a whole column of one's comrades marched
to a destruction one had the power to avert.</p>

<p>What to do? Should I lower the Flag? Run it up and
down a few times? Wave my arms and dance about, up on the
look-out platform?...</p>

<p>As likely as not, he would take any such signals as
signs of joy and welcome. If I were he, approaching a
fully-manned fort over whose crowded walls floated the
Flag, I should certainly see nothing of warning about such
demonstrations as those.</p>

<p>Until I was actually fired upon, I should certainly
suppose I was safe and being welcomed to the fort by those
whom I had been too late to assist in their victory over
some impudent little raiding-party.</p>

<p>Exactly! <i>Until fired upon!</i> That would surely give him
something to think about&mdash;and, moreover, would give me
a chance of escape, even yet.... Long before he came within
shouting-distance he would be rushed by the Arabs. I would
do the firing.</p>

<p>Kneeling down and resting my rifle in an embrasure, I
aimed as though my life depended on hitting him. I then
raised my fore-sight half an inch, and fired. Rushing to
another embrasure, I took another shot, this time aiming to
hit the ground, well in front of him.</p>

<p>He halted.</p>

<p>That was enough.</p>

<p>If he walked into an ambush now, he was no officer of
the Nineteenth Army Corps of Africa....</p>

<p>Rushing across to the side of the roof furthest from
his line of approach, I dropped my rifle over, climbed
the parapet, hung by my hands and then dropped, thanking
God that my feet would encounter sand.... Snatching up
my rifle, I ran as hard as I could go, to the nearest
sand-hill. If this were occupied I would die fighting,
and the sounds of rifle-fire would further warn the
relief-column. If it were not occupied, I would hide and
see what happened. Possibly I might be able to make a
very timely diversion upon the Arab flank if there were
a fight, and, in any case, I might hope to escape under
cover of darkness.... The sand-hill was not occupied, I was
safely out of the fort, and a chance of getting safely away
existed, whether the Arabs attacked the column or not.</p>

<p>I crept into an Arab trench and set to work to make a
hole in it, that I might be as inconspicuous as possible
should anybody come, or look, in my direction.</p>

<p>From between two stones on the edge of the parapet of
my trench, I could watch the fort and the oasis. I was
conscious of an uneasy sensation as I watched, that I
myself might be under the observation of enemies in my
rear....</p>

<p>As soon as I saw what the Arabs and the approaching
column were going to do, I would consider the possibilities
of a safe retreat in the most likely direction....</p>

<p>I began to wish something would happen, for the
situation was a little trying, and there was too strong
a suggestion of leaving an Arab frying-pan on the one
hand, to step into the French fire on the other... an Arab
torture by frying... a French firing-party at dawn.</p>

<p>While I lay gazing to my front and wondering what might
be happening behind me, I was astonished to see the French
officer come round the corner of the fort, alone, and
proceeding as unconcernedly as if he were riding in the
streets of Sidi-bel-Abbès!...</p>

<p>Well! I had done my best for him and his column. I had
risked my own safety to warn him that things were not what
they seemed&mdash;and if the Arabs got him and his men, it
was not my fault.</p>

<p>He could hardly call <i>being shot at</i> a welcome from the
fort?... Round the walls he rode, staring up at the dead
defenders.</p>

<p>I wondered if the shade thrown by the peaks of their
caps would so hide and disguise their faces that, from
below, it would be impossible to see that the men were
dead....</p>

<p>What were the Arabs doing?... Leaving him as further
bait for the trap, and waiting for the whole column to walk
into it?</p>

<p>Ought I to warn them again? Surely once was enough? It
would mean almost certain capture for me, by one side or
the other, if I fired again.... Apparently this officer
was unwarnable, moreover, and it would be nothing but a
vain sacrifice to proclaim my existence and my position,
by firing again.... And while I argued the matter with my
conscience, I saw that all was well&mdash;the relieving
force was approaching <i>en tirailleur,</i> preceded by scouts
and guarded by flankers.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully the French force advanced, well
handled by somebody more prudent than the officer who had
arrived first, and by no means disposed to walk into an
Arab ambush.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, I heard the trumpeter summoning the
fort, blowing his calls to dead ears.</p>

<p>I could imagine the bewilderment of the officer standing
before those closed gates, waiting for them to open, while
the dead stared at him and nothing stirred.</p>

<p>As I waited for him to climb up into the fort or to
send somebody in, to open the gates for him, I came to the
conclusion that the Arabs must have abandoned the siege and
departed altogether. I wondered whether this had been due
to Lejaune's ruse and the fort's apparently undiminished
garrison, or to news, from their scouts, of the approach
of a strong relief force. Anyhow, gone they were, and very
probably they had raised the siege and vanished after moon-
rise the previous night....</p>

<p>The officer, his <i>sous-officier,</i> the trumpeter, and a
fourth man, stood in a little group beneath the wall, some
three hundred yards or so from where I lay.... I gathered
that the fourth man was refusing to climb into the fort.
There was pointing, there were gesticulations, and the
officer drew his revolver and presented it at the face of
the man who had shaken his head when the officer pointed up
at the wall.</p>

<p>The trumpeter, his trumpet dangling as he swung himself
up, climbed from the back of his camel to a projecting
waterspout, and through an embrasure into the fort.</p>

<p>I expected to see him reappear a minute later at the
gate, and admit the others.</p>

<p>He never reappeared at all, and, about a quarter of an
hour later, the officer himself climbed up and entered the
fort in the same way.</p>

<p>As before, I expected to see the gates opened a minute
later&mdash;but nothing happened. There was silence and
stillness. The minutes dragged by, and the men of the
relief-column stood still as statues, staring at the
enigmatical fort.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the officer bawling to the trumpeter,
the men outside the fort began to move towards it in
attack-formation, another squadron of the relief-column
arrived on mules, the gates were thrown open from within,
and the officer came out alone.</p>

<p>He gave some orders, and re-entered the fort with his
second-in-command. No one else went in.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the officer's companion reappeared,
called up a sergeant, and gave orders, evidently for
camping in the oasis.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that my situation was about to
become an unwholesome one, as, before long, there would
be vedettes posted on all four sides of the fort in a big
circle, to say nothing of patrols.</p>

<p>I must be going, if I wished to go at all, before I was
within a ring of sentries....</p>

<p>After a good look round, I crawled painfully and slowly
to the next sand-hill, trusting that the two in the fort
would find too much of interest, within its walls, to have
time to look over them and see me on my brief journey from
cover to cover. Apparently this was the case, for when I
reached the next sand-hill and looked back from behind its
crest, there was no sign that I had been seen.</p>

<p>I rested, regained my breath, and then made another bolt
to the sand-hill behind me, keeping the fort between the
oasis and my line of retreat, and a good look-out for the
vedette which, sooner or later, was certain to come more or
less in this direction.</p>

<p>My best plan would be to creep from cover to cover,
between the sand-hills, as I was doing, until beyond the
vedette-circle, and then hide and rest till night fell. A
good night's forced marching and I should be thirty miles
away before the sun gained full strength, on the morrow. As
though for a prize&mdash; and, of course, my life <i>was</i> the
prize&mdash;I carried out this careful scouting retirement
until I was half a mile from the fort and among the big
stones that crowned a little hill of rock and sand. Here I
was safe enough for the present. I could lie hidden and see
where the vedettes were posted; sleep in what shade there
was; eat, drink, rest, and gather strength; and set forth,
when the moon rose, on my fairly hopeless journey....
Fairly hopeless?... Absolutely hopeless&mdash;unless I
could secure a camel.... And then and there, I firmly
rejected the idea that entered my mind&mdash;of killing a
vedette to get his beast. That I could regard as nothing
better than cold-blooded murder.</p>

<p>A more acceptable notion was that of trying to creep
into the oasis, during the night, and stealing a camel
from there. It would be an extremely difficult thing to do
successfully, for there would be brilliant moonlight, a
very sharp look-out for Arabs, and a horrible row from the
camel when one disturbed it.... Yes, very difficult and
dangerous, but just possible, inasmuch as I was in uniform
and might be believed if, challenged by the camel-guard,
I pretended I was an orderly in search of his camel, for
duty. Or if I walked up boldly and announced that I had
been ordered to take a camel and ride back to Tokotu with a
dispatch.... Distinctly possible, I considered. With really
good luck and a really good bluff, it might be done. The
good luck would lie in the camel-guard being unaware that I
wasn't a member of the relief-force at all.</p>

<p>If I were not recognised, if my bluff were convincing,
if I were not caught in the act by the very officer whom I
should be pretending to have sent me for a camel; or if,
on the other hand, there were a chance of simply stealing
the camel unseen&mdash;I might get away with it. But there
seemed to be a good many <i>ifs....</i></p>

<p>However, after thinking the matter over from all points
of view, and weighing the chances impartially, I came to
the conclusion that there was more likelihood of Michael's
letter reaching Aunt Patricia if I had a shot at getting
a camel, than if I did not. A thousand-mile stroll across
the Soudanese Sahara did not strike me as one that would
lead me home, in view of the fact that it takes a good man
to do it under the somewhat more favourable conditions of
preparation, organisation, and the protection of numbers
and of the law (such as it is).</p>

<p>I decided to wait until night, see what happened, and
reconnoitre the oasis with a view to deciding whether
theft, bluff, or a combination of the two, offered the
greater possibilities of success in securing a mount.</p>

<p>And the more I could concentrate my thoughts upon
problems and considerations of this sort, the longer could
I postpone and evade the on-rushing realisation of my
loss... the longer could I keep myself numb and insensate
beneath the hammer-blows of the terrible Fact that lurked
and struck, lurked and struck; the longer deafen myself to
the waxing Voice with its... <i>Michael is dead... Michael is
dead.... Listen and heed&mdash;Michael is dead....</i></p>

<p>In spite of the terrific heat and my unutterable misery
and wretchedness, I fell asleep, and slept soundly until
towards evening.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">When I awoke, I realised that I had been
lucky. The nearest vedette was quite a thousand yards to
my right, and so placed that there was no fear of my being
seen, so long as I exercised reasonable precaution.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, the appalling heat of the day was
waning in fierceness, and the fort and oasis presented
a scene of normal military activity&mdash;or rather
inactivity&mdash;for nothing whatever moved in or around
the fort, and there was but little coming and going about
the oasis. Here and there, a sentry's bayonet gleamed, a
man led a mule or camel; a little column of smoke rose
from among the palms, as a cooking-fire was lighted or
replenished.</p>

<p>So far as I could see, the fort had not been taken over
by a new garrison, nor to my surprise, had the dead been
removed from the walls. Those motionless figures could not
be living soldiers, for no Commandant would have kept his
whole force on duty like that&mdash;particularly after a
day-and-night march such as this one had just made.</p>

<p>I should have expected to see that the dead had been
buried, the fort occupied, the look-out platform manned,
and the sentry-posts occupied. However, it didn't matter to
me what they did, so long as they left their camels in the
oasis....</p>

<p>As I watched, a small party, preceded by an officer on
a mule, crossed from the oasis and entered the fort. I
expected to see them remove the dead from the embrasures,
but they did not do so. From where I was, I could not see
on to the roof, but I should have seen them at work, had
they come to the wall and begun their labours as a burial
fatigue-party....</p>

<p>Before long, the party returned to the oasis, the
officer remaining in the fort. I wondered what they made of
the <i>adjudant</i> with a French bayonet in him, of the dead
<i>légionnaire</i> with his eyes closed and his hands crossed
upon his breast, of the men dead upon their feet, of the
complete absence of life in the uncaptured fort from which
two warning shots had come.... Some of the superstitious
old legionaries would have wonderful ideas and theories
about it all!</p>

<p>The evening wore on, the sun set, and the great moon
rose. In the brief dusk, I crept nearer to the fort and
oasis, crouching and crawling from sand-hill to sand-hill.
I would wait until everybody who was not on duty would be
asleep; and then work round and enter the oasis, walking
up boldly as though sent from the fort with a message. If
challenged, I would act precisely as I should have done if
dispatched by an officer to get my camel and hasten back to
Tokotu....</p>

<p>I imagined myself saying to a sentry who was disposed
to doubt me, "All right, you fool, you hinder me&mdash;go
on.... Don't blame me, though, when I say what delayed
me!..." and generally showing a perfect willingness
to be hindered, provided I was not the one to get the
blame....</p>

<p>From the crest of the next sand-hill, I saw that the men
of the relieving-column were parading outside the oasis,
and I wondered what this portended.</p>

<p>As I watched, they marched towards the fort, halted,
faced into line, with their backs towards me, and stood
easy. I concluded that their officer had given them an
"off" day after their long march, and was now going to
work them all night at clearing up the fort, burying
the dead, and generally re-establishing Zinderneuf
as a going concern among the military outposts of
Empire-according-to-a-Republic.</p>

<p>This might be very favourable to my plans. If I marched
boldly up to the oasis, as though coming from the fort,
when everybody was very busy, and demanded a camel, I
should probably get one....</p>

<p>The Commandant rode out from the oasis on a mule, and
the men were called to attention. He was evidently going
to address them&mdash;probably to congratulate them on
the excellence of their forced march and refer to the
marvellous defence put up by the garrison of the fort, who
had died to a man in defence of the Flag of their adopted
country.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the man standing beside him cried out and
pointed to the fort. Instinctively I looked in the
direction of his pointing finger&mdash;and very nearly
sprang to my feet at what I saw.</p>

<p>The fort was on fire!</p>

<p>It was very much on fire too, obviously set alight in
several places and with the help of oil or some other
almost explosive combustible.... And what might <i>this</i>
mean? Surely it was not "by order"? Not the result of
official decision?</p>

<p>Of course not.... Could it be the work of some
superstitious legionary left alone in the place as
watchman? No. If there were anybody at all on duty there,
he would have been up on the look-out platform, the
emptiness of which had puzzled me....</p>

<p>How was this going to affect my chance of escape? Ought
I to make a dash for the oasis while all hands were engaged
in an attempt to put the fire out?</p>

<p>And, as I stared, in doubt and wonder, I was aware of a
movement on the roof of the fort!</p>

<p>Carefully keeping the gate-tower between himself and the
paraded troops, a man was doing precisely what I myself had
done! I saw his cap as he crept crouching along below the
parapet, I saw his arm and rifle come through an embrasure,
I saw the rifle fall, and a minute or so later, as a column
of smoke shot up, I saw him crawl through the embrasure and
drop to the ground. By good luck or by skill, he had chosen
a spot at which he was hidden from the vedette that had
been a thousand yards to my right....</p>

<p>And who could he be, this legionary who had set fire to
the fort of Zinderneuf? He certainly had my sympathy and
should have my assistance. I must see that he did not crawl
in the direction of the vedette. He might not know that he
was there. I began creeping in a direction that would bring
me on to his line of retreat in time to warn him.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he saw me, and hitched his rifle
forward. Evidently he did not intend to be taken alive.
Very naturally, after setting fire to one of <i>Madame la
République's</i> perfectly good forts.... I drew out what
had been a handkerchief, and from the safe obscurity of
a sand-valley, waved it. I then laid my rifle down and
crawled towards him. I noticed that he was wearing a
trumpet, slung behind him.</p>

<p>As I came closer to the man, I was conscious of that
strange contraction of the scalp-muscles which has given
rise to the expression "his hair stood on end with
fright."</p>

<p>I was not frightened and my hair did not stand on end,
but I grew cold with a kind of horrified wonder as I saw
what I took to be the ghost or astral form <i>of my brother</i>
there before me, looking perfectly normal, alive, and
natural.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> my brother&mdash;my brother
Digby&mdash;Michael's twin....</p>

<p>"Hullo, John," said Digby, as I stared open-mouthed and
incredulous, "I thought you'd be knocking about somewhere
round here. Let's get off to a healthier spot, shall
us?"</p>

<p>For all his casual manner and debonair bearing, he
looked white and drawn, sick to death, his hands shaking,
his face a ghastly mask of pain.</p>

<p>"Wounded?" I asked, seeing the state he was in.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;not physically.... I have just been giving
Michael a '<i>Viking's Funeral,</i>'" he replied, biting his
lip.</p>

<p>Poor, poor Digby! He loved Michael as much as I did
(he could not love him more), and he was further bound to
him by those strange ties that unite twins&mdash;psychic
spiritual bonds, that make them more like one soul in two
bodies than separate individuals. Poor, poor Digby!</p>

<p>I put my arm across his shoulders as we lay on the sand
between two hillocks.</p>

<p>"Poor old John!" he said at length, mastering his grief.
"It was you who laid him out, of course. You, who saw him
die.... Poor Johnny boy!..."</p>

<p>"He died trying to save my life," I said. "He died quite
happily and in no pain.... He left a job for us to do....
I've got a letter for you. Here it is.... Let's get well
off to the flank of that vedette and lie low till there's a
chance to pinch a camel and clear out..." and I led the way
in a direction to bring us clear of the vedettes and nearer
to the oasis.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes after our meeting, we were snugly
ensconced behind the crest of a sand-hill, overlooking the
parade of our comrades, the oasis, and the burning fort.
A higher hillock behind us, and to our right, screened us
from the nearest vedette.</p>

<p>"<i>And,</i>" said Digby, in a voice that trembled slightly,
"they're not going to spoil Michael's funeral. Nor are they
going to secure any evidence of your neat job on the foul
Lejaune.... They're going to be attacked by Arabs..." and
he raised his rifle.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot anybody, Dig," I said. It seemed to me
there had been enough bloodshed, and if these people
were now technically our enemies and might soon be our
executioners, they were still our comrades, and innocent of
offence.</p>

<p>"Not going to&mdash;unless it's myself," replied Digby.
"Come on, play Arabs with me..." and he fired his rifle,
aiming high.</p>

<p>I followed his example, shooting above the head of the
officer as I had done once before that day.</p>

<p>Again and again we fired, vedettes to left and right of
us joining in, and showing their zeal and watchfulness by
firing briskly at nothing at all&mdash; unless it was at
each other.</p>

<p>It was a sight worth seeing, the retreat of that company
of legionaries. At a cool order from the officer, they
faced about, opened out, doubled to the oasis, and went
to ground, turning to the enemy and taking cover so that,
within a couple of minutes of our first shots, there was
nothing to be seen but a dark and menacing oasis, to
approach which was death....</p>

<p>"Good work!" said Digby. "And they can jolly well stop
there until the fort is burnt out.... We'll go in and get
camels, as vedettes whose camels have been shot by these
attacking Arabs, later on.... If we swagger up to the
sentry on the camels, and pitch a bold yarn, it ought to be
all right...."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;better if one of us goes," said I. "Then, if
he doesn't return, the other can clear off on foot, or try
some other dodge."</p>

<p>"That's it," agreed Digby. "I'll have first go."</p>

<p>"Now tell me all that happened," he added, "and then
I'll bring you up to date."</p>

<p>I did so, giving him a full account of all our doings,
from the time he had left us to go to the mounted
company.</p>

<p>"Now tell me a few things, Dig," I said, when I had
finished, and he knew as much as I did.</p>

<p>He then told me of how his <i>escouade</i> had suddenly
been ordered from Tanout-Azzal to Tokotu. Here they had
found, of all people on this earth, the Spahi officer who
had once visited Brandon Abbas, now Major de Beaujolais,
seconded from his regiment for duty with mounted units
in the <i>Territoire Militaire</i> of the Soudan, where the
mobile Touaregs were presenting a difficult problem to the
peaceful penetrators towards Timbuktu and Lake Tchad.</p>

<p>The Major had not recognised Digby, of course, nor Digby
him, until he heard his name and that he was a Spahi.</p>

<p>(And it was at him that I had been shooting that day, or
rather it was he at whom I had not been shooting. It was
this very friend of boyhood's days whom I had been trying
to warn against what I thought was an ambush!... Time's
whirligig!...)</p>

<p>At Tokotu, news had been received that Zinderneuf was
besieged by a huge force of Touaregs, and de Beaujolais had
set off at once.</p>

<p>The rest I knew until the moment when I had seen
Digby, who was de Beaujolais' trumpeter, climb into the
fort....</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you know what I saw as I got on to the
roof," said Digby, "and you can imagine (can you, I
wonder?) what I felt when I saw Beau lying there.... I
dashed down below and rushed round to see if you were
among the wounded, and then realised that there <i>were</i> no
wounded, and that the entire garrison was on that awful
roof.... That meant that you had cleared out, and that it
was your bayonet ornamenting Lejaune's chest, and that it
was you who had disposed Michael's body and closed his
eyes. <i>Someone</i> must have done it, and it wasn't one of
those dead men.... Who else but you would have treated
Michael's body differently from the others? As I have told
you, I was mighty anxious, coming along, as to how you and
Michael were getting on, and whether we should be in time,
and I had been itching to get up on to the roof while de
Beaujolais was being dramatic with Rastignac.... You can
guess how anxious I was <i>now....</i> What with Michael's death
and your disappearance....</p>

<p>"I could almost <i>see</i> you killing Lejaune, and felt
certain it was because he had killed Michael and tried to
kill you for that cursed 'diamond'... I tell you I went
dotty....</p>

<p>"'<i>Anyhow&mdash;he shall have a</i> "<i>Viking's Funeral,</i>"'
I swore, and I believe I yelled the words at the top of my
voice, '<i>and then I must find John.</i>' <i>...</i> You know, it
was always Beau's constant worry that harm would come to
you. It was the regret of his life, that he was responsible
for your bolting from home.... You young ass....</p>

<p>"Anyhow, my one idea was to give him a proper funeral
and then to follow you up. I guessed that you had stuck
there, the sole survivor, until you saw de Beaujolais, and
then slipped over the wall....</p>

<p>"Then I heard someone scrambling and scraping at the
wall, climbing up, and I crept off and rushed down below,
with the idea of hiding till I got a chance to set fire
to the beastly place, if I could do nothing better for
Beau.... I saw the door of the punishment-cell standing
open, and I slipped in there and hid behind the door. There
was just room for me, and I should never be seen until
someone came in and closed the door of the cell&mdash;which
wasn't likely to happen for a long while....</p>

<p>"Soon I heard de Beaujolais bawling out for me, and
by the sound of his voice he wasn't much happier than I
was.... The sight upstairs was enough to shake <i>anybody's</i>
nerve, let alone the puzzle of it all.... By and by I
heard him and the Sergeant-Major talking and hunting for
me. They actually looked into the cell once, but it was
obviously empty&mdash;besides being a most unlikely place
for a soldier to shut himself in voluntarily!... I gathered
that old Dufour was even less happy than de Beaujolais,
who certainly wasn't enjoying himself.... Presently they
went away, and the place became as silent as the grave.
It occurred to me that whatever else they made of it they
must be certain that Lejaune had been killed by one of
his own men and that the man must have bolted. If I could
also vanish in this mysterious place, it would give them
something more to puzzle over; and if I could absolutely
destroy it, there would be no evidence for them to lay
before a court martial.... Mind, I had been marching for
twenty-four hours and was all but sleeping on my feet, so I
wasn't at my brightest and best, by a long way&mdash;apart
from what I had just seen....</p>

<p>"When I felt pretty certain that there was no one about,
I crept up on to the roof again and took a look round.</p>

<p>"There was a sentry at the gate, and the company was
evidently going to camp in the oasis, and have a sleep
before entering the fort.</p>

<p>"I pulled myself together, crawled over to where Beau
lay, heaved him up in my arms and carried him below to his
own bed in the barrack-room. All round his cot I laid piles
of wood from the cook-house and drenched it with lamp oil.
I did my best to make it a real '<i>Viking's Funeral</i>' for
him, just like we used to have at home. Just like he used
to want it. My chief regret was that I had no Union Jack to
drape over him....</p>

<p>"However, I did the best I could, and covered the whole
pyre with sheets of canvas and things.... All white, more
or less.... There was no sign of the wood and oil.... He
looked splendid.... Then, after thinking it over, I took
the spare Tri-couleur and laid that over all.... It wasn't
what I would have liked, but he had fought and died under
it, so it served.... It served.... Served...."</p>

<p>Digby's head was nodding as he talked. He was like a
somnambulist. I tried to stop him.</p>

<p>"Shut up, John.... I must get it clear.... <i>Oh, Beau!
Beau!... I did my best for you, old chap.... There was no
horse, nor spear, nor shield to lay beside you.... But
I put a dog at your feet though.... And your rifle and
bayonet were for sword and spear....</i>"</p>

<p>He must be going mad, I feared.</p>

<p>"A dog, old chap?" I said, trying to get him back to
realities. "You are not getting it right, you know...."</p>

<p>"Yes, a dog.... A dog at his feet.... A dog lying
crouching with its head beneath his heels...."</p>

<p>This was getting dreadful.</p>

<p>"I did not carry it down, as I carried Beau. I took it
by one foot and dragged it down...."</p>

<p>"<i>Lejaune?</i>" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes, John. Lejaune&mdash;with your bayonet through his
heart. <i>He</i> won't give dumb evidence against you&mdash;and
Beau had his '<i>Viking's Funeral</i>' with a dog at his
feet...."</p>

<p>I think I felt worse then than I had felt since Michael
died. I gave Digby a sharp nudge in the ribs with my
elbow.</p>

<p>"Get on with it and don't drivel," I said as though in
anger.</p>

<p>"Where was I?" said Digby, in the tone of a man waking
from a nap.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. And when all was ready, John, I sat and talked
to Beau and told him I hadn't the faintest idea as to what
he'd been up to in this 'Blue Water' business, but what I
<i>did</i> know was that, far from being anything shady, it was
something quixotic and noble.... And then what do you think
I did, John?... I <i>fell asleep</i>&mdash;and slept till the
evening....</p>

<p>"I was a bit more my own man when I woke up. I went up
on the roof to see what was doing.... Creeping to the wall
and peeping over, I saw that the Company was parading,
and that I had cut it very fine. I thanked God that I
had awakened in time, for in a few minutes they would be
marching in, to clean up and take over.</p>

<p>"I crept back and set fire to Beau's funeral pyre.
Then I rushed off and poured a can of oil over the pile
of benches and furniture that I had heaped up in the next
room. I set light to that and knocked another can over at
the foot of the stairs. I lit it and bolted up to the stair
of the look-out platform. At the bottom of this, I did the
same, and by that time it would have taken more water than
there is in the Sahara to put the fire out.... I decided
that Beau's funeral was all right, the evidence against you
destroyed, and the time arrived for me to clear out...."</p>

<p>He yawned prodigiously.</p>

<p>"So I came to look for you, John.... To look for...
for..."</p>

<p>Digby was asleep.</p>

<p>Should I go to sleep too? The temptation was sore. But
I felt that if we were to save ourselves, we must do it
at once. We could hardly hope to lie there all night and
escape detection in the morning, when the place would be
swarming with scouts and skirmishers.</p>

<p>I decided to watch for an hour or two, while poor Digby
slept. At the end of that time I would wake him and say
that I was going to make the attempt to get a camel....</p>

<p>It was extraordinarily silent.... It seemed impossible
that the oasis, lying there so black and still, was alive
with armed men. Even the camels and mules were behaving as
though aware that the night was unusual. Not a grunting
gurgle from the one or a whinnying bray from the other
broke the brooding stillness of the night. I wondered if
every man had been made responsible for the silence of his
own animal, and had muzzled and gagged it. I smiled at the
idea.</p>

<p>Not a light showed. Was the idea to make the smouldering
fort a bait for the Arabs whom de Beaujolais would suppose
to be in the neighbourhood&mdash;a bait to attract them to
his lead-and-steel-fanged trap?...</p>

<p>How would it be possible, after all, for me to approach
that silvered black oasis, across the moonlit sands,
without being challenged, seized, and exposed for what I
was? I had anticipated approaching a normal, somnolent
camp&mdash; not a tensely watchful look-out post, such as
the oasis had become from the time Digby and I had fired
our rifles.</p>

<p>Would it be better, after all, to sleep all night and
try to bluff the camel-guard on the morrow, when the whole
place would be buzzing with life and activity? It seemed a
poor look-out anyway. And how bitterly one would regret not
having made the attempt on foot, if one were seized in the
effort to take a camel....</p>

<p>Having decided that Digby had slept for about a couple
of hours, I woke him up.</p>

<p>"What about it, Dig?" I said. "Are we going to have a
shot at getting a camel, or are we going to march? We must
do one or the other, unless you think we might do any good
here by daylight...."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," replied Digby. "I'm sure you're right,
John," and went to sleep again, in the act of speaking.</p>

<p>This was not exactly helpful, and I was trying to make
up my mind as to whether I should give him another hour,
or knock him up again at once, when I saw two camel-riders
leave the oasis. I rubbed my eyes.</p>

<p>No. There was no doubt about it. A patrol was going out,
or dispatches were being sent to Tokotu.</p>

<p>Here were two camels. Two well-fed, well-watered camels
were coming towards us.</p>

<p>I did not for one moment entertain the thought of
shooting their riders, but I certainly toyed for a moment
with the idea of offering to fight them, fair and square,
for their beasts! If we won, we should ride off and they
would tramp back to the oasis. If they won, they'd continue
about their business and we should be where we were....
A silly notion.... About two seconds after revealing
ourselves, we should be looking into the muzzles of their
rifles, and have the option of death or ignominious
capture.... Why <i>should</i> they fight us?... I must really
pull myself together and remember who I was and where I
was....</p>

<p>The camels drew nearer and I decided, from their
direction, they were on the way to Tokotu.</p>

<p>I crawled down the reverse slope of my sand-hill and ran
along the valley at its base. Climbing another hillock, I
saw that a repetition of the man&oelig;uvre would bring
me on to their line. I did not know what I was going to
do when I got there, but I felt there would be no harm in
trying to find out who they were and where they were going.
If we followed them and got a chance to steal their camels
while they were not too far from the oasis to return on
foot, I had an idea that we might take that chance. The
temptation would be very strong, as it was a matter of life
and death to us, while to them it would be merely a matter
of a long day's march and a fearful tale of terrific combat
with the horde of Arabs who had shot their camels....</p>

<p>Suddenly a well-known voice remarked
conversationally:</p>

<p>"We sure gotta put them nigs wise, Buddy.... We don'
want nawthen to eventooate to the pore boobs through us not
taking 'em by the hand...."</p>

<p>"Hank!" I yelped in glee and thankfulness, and he and
Buddy turned their camels towards me.</p>

<p>"Here's <i>one</i> of the mystery boys, anyhow," went on
Hank. "I allowed as how you'd be around somewheres when we
see you all three gone missin' from the old home...."</p>

<p>In a valley between two sand-hills, Hank and Buddy
brought their camels to their knees and dismounted. Both
wrung my hand in a painful and most delightful manner.</p>

<p>"No offence, and excusin' a personal and dellikit
question, Bo," said Buddy, "but was it you as had the
accident with the cigar-lighter an' kinder caused arsonical
proceedins?..."</p>

<p>"Sort of 'arson about' with matches like?" put in Hank
solemnly.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "It was Digby set fire to the fort."</p>

<p>"Then I would shore like to shake him by the hand,
some," said Hank. "Is he around?"</p>

<p>"Having a nap over there," I replied.</p>

<p>"The other bright boy too?" asked Buddy. "An' where's
Lejaune? Havin' set fire to the home, hev you taken
Poppa by the ear an' led him out into the garden for to
admire?..."</p>

<p>As quickly as possible I told him what had
happened&mdash;of Michael's death and "funeral."</p>

<p>"He was a shore white man, pard. 'Nuff said," commented
Hank.</p>

<p>"He was all-wool-an'-a-yard-wide, Bo," said Buddy, and I
felt that Michael might have had worse epitaphs.</p>

<p>A brief silence fell upon us.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Hank after a while. "Wouldn't it jar you? It
shore beats the band. Such nice quiet boys too&mdash;always
behavin' like they was at a party, an' perlite as
Hell&mdash;an' one of 'em kills the Big Noise an' the other
sets the whole gosh-dinged outfit afire an' burns out the
dod-gasted burg.... <i>Some</i> boys, I allow...."</p>

<p>I greatly feared that our deeds of homicide and arson
had raised us higher in the estimation of these good men
than any number of pious acts and gentle words could ever
have done.</p>

<p>As I led the way to where I had left Digby sleeping, I
asked the Americans where they were going.</p>

<p>"Wal&mdash;we was sorta sent lookin' fer some nigs from
Tokotu," replied Hank. "Ole Man Bojolly allows they'll run
into an Injun ambush if they ain't put wise. We gotta warn
them there's Injuns about, fer all the location's so quiet
an' peaceful-lookin'..."</p>

<p>"I wonder they didn't git you two boys when they shot us
up," he added.</p>

<p>"We <i>were</i> the Arabs," I confessed with modest pride.</p>

<p>"Gee!" admired Buddy. "Can you beat it!... I shore
thought there was thousands come gunnin' fer us.... Oh,
<i>boy!</i> You quiet perlite young guys.... <i>Mother!</i>..."</p>

<p>"How many guns did you shoot then?" enquired Hank.</p>

<p>"Two," I replied. "Rapid fire. And then the vedettes
obligingly joined in."</p>

<p>Buddy gave a brief hard bark, which may, or may not,
have been meant for laughter.</p>

<p>"Sunday pants of Holy Moses!" he observed. "And that
lyin' son of a skunk of a Schneider swore he shot seven of
you himself&mdash;and the rest of you carried away their
bodies as he retired in good order! Thinks he oughta get
the <i>médaille militaire</i> or somethin'...."</p>

<p>"Yep," confirmed Hank, "an' Ole Man Dupanloup estimates
the lot that was agwine ter rush the parade, when he held
'em up, at from a hunderd to a hunderd an' fifty. He lost
count of the number he killed&mdash;after a score or so....
Gee! At them north outposts there was <i>some</i> bloody battle,
son...."</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> some bloody liars," observed Buddy, who had
sojourned in London.</p>

<p>I had difficulty in awaking poor Digby, but when he
realised that Hank and Buddy were actually present in the
flesh, he was soon very much awake and on the spot.</p>

<p>"Say, boys," he went on, after greeting them and hearing
their tale of the Battle of the Vedettes, "it's a lot to
ask, I know. But <i>do</i> you think you could be attacked, like
Dupanloup, by about a hundred and fifty of us, and lose
your camels?... They'd be shot beneath you, or on top of
you, if you like,--while you fought desperately&mdash;one
to seventy-five, isn't it?... You would have peace with
honour, and we'd have a chance to save our lives. We don't
pretend that they're very valuable, but we've got something
we really must do for our brother.... And I promised Mother
I'd bring the Baby home," he added, indicating me.</p>

<p>"Fergit it, son," replied Hank to Digby, but he looked
at Buddy.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you possibly let us have them?" I said. "If we
went a mile or two further on, we could kick up a fearful
row with our four rifles, and you could go back and collect
a medal when old Dupanloup gets his.... Stroll home doing
a rear-guard stunt, and we'd pepper the scenery in your
direction before we rode off.... The Senegalese are safe
enough. There are no Arabs and no ambush.... And we simply
shan't have a little dog's chance without camels."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> want 'em, Bo," replied Hank with quiet
finality.</p>

<p>"Shore," agreed Buddy, eyeing him.</p>

<p>I was surprised and disappointed. Even more disappointed
at the attitude of my friends than at the loss of the
camels.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;all right then! We won't <i>fight</i> you
for them," said Digby, "but I wish it had been someone
else."</p>

<p>"I don't get your drift. Snow again, Bo," said Buddy,
who seemed pained.</p>

<p>"Why someone else? Don't you admire our low and vulgar
ways, pard?" asked Hank. "Don't you like us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but to be honest, at the moment I like your camels
better," replied Digby.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;you got the lot, ain't you?" asked
Hank. "What's bitin' you now, Bo?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean <i>you're coming with us?</i>" I asked, a great
light dawning upon me, a light that so dazzled my eyes that
I was afraid to look upon it.</p>

<p>"You shore said a mouthful, Bo," replied Hank. "Why,
what did you figger? That we'd leave you two innercent
children to wander about this yer sinful world all on your
lone?..."</p>

<p>"After you bin and killed their Big Noise? And
obliterised their nice little block-house?" put in
Buddy. "'Twouldn't be right, boy. '<i>Course</i> we're comin'
along."</p>

<p>I really had to swallow hard as I took their horny
hands.</p>

<p>"But look here, boys," Digby remonstrated, after
following my example and trying to express thanks without
words, "there's no need for that. Give us your camels and
anything else you can safely spare, and go back in modest
glory. There's nothing against <i>you.</i> If you're caught
escaping with us and helping us, you'll be shot with us. It
will be 'desertion in the face of the enemy when sent on
reconnaissance' when it comes to the court martial."</p>

<p>"Go back nawthen," said Buddy. "Look at here. This is
what Hank wants to say.... Is there any Injuns around?
Nope. Is those nigs from Tokotu in any danger? Nope. Hev
you had a square deal in this Madam Lar Republic-house
stunt? Nope. Didn't you and your brother stand by your
dooty in this mutiny game? Yep. Wasn't you two scrapping
all the time and doing your damnedest till everybody else
had handed in their checks! Yep. And then didn't this
Lejaune guy start in to shoot you up? Shore. And what'll
happen to you now if they get you? Shoot you up some more.
Shore. 'Tain't a square deal....</p>

<p>"Well, we figger that these nigs from Tokotu aren't
on the chutes fer the bow-wows. Nope. They're marchin'
on right now fer Zinderneuf&mdash;like John Brown's
body&mdash;or was it his soul?&mdash;safe enough.... We
allow you ain't got no chance on a lone trail. Not a
doggoned smell of one. You're two way-up gay cats an'
bright boys, but you're no road-kids. You don't know
chaparral from an arroyo nor alkali sage-brush from
frijoles. You couldn't tell mesquite from a pinto-hoss.
Therefore Hank says we gotta come along...."</p>

<p>"Shore thing," agreed Hank, "and time we vamoosed too,
or we'll hev these nigs a-treadin' on us. They'll go fer a
walk on empty stummicks&mdash;ours...."</p>

<p>A minute later each of the camels bore two riders, and
we were padding off at a steady eight miles an hour.</p>

<p>"Any pertickler direction like?" said Hank, behind whom
I was riding. "London? N'York? Morocker? Egyp'? Cape Town?
All the same ter me."</p>

<p>Buddy drove his camel up beside ours.</p>

<p>"What about it, Dig?" said I to my brother. "We've got
to get out of French territory.... Morocco's north-west;
Nigeria's south-east...."</p>

<p>"And where's water?" replied Digby. "I should say the
nearest oasis would be a sound objective."</p>

<p>"If there's a pursuit, they'd take the line for Morocco
for certain, I should say," I pointed out. "I vote for the
opposite direction and a beady eye on our fellow-man, if
we can see him. Where there are Arabs there'll be water
somewhere about, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Shore," said Hank. "We'll pursoo the pore Injun. What's
good enough fer him is bad enough for us. You say wheer you
wants ter go, an' I allow <i>we'll see you there</i>&mdash;but
it may take a few years. What we gotta do first is turn
Injun, see?... Git Injun glad rags, and live like they
does. We're well-armed and got our health an' strength an'
hoss-sense. When in the desert do as the deserters does....
Yep. We gotta turn Injun."</p>

<p>From which I gathered that Hank the Wise firmly
advocated our early metamorphosis into Arabs, and the
adoption of Arab methods of subsistence in waterless
places.</p>

<p>"Injuns lives by lettin' other folks <i>pro-</i>juce an' then
collectin'," put in Buddy.</p>

<p>"We gotta collect," said Hank.</p>

<p>"From the collectors," added Buddy.</p>

<p>From which I gathered further that our friends
were proposing not only that we should turn Arab, but
super-Arab, and should prey upon the Touareg as the
Touareg preyed upon the ordinary desert-dweller. It seemed
a sound plan, if a little difficult of application.
However, I had infinite faith in the resourcefulness,
experience, staunchness, and courage of the two Americans,
and reflected that if anybody could escape from this
predicament, it was these men, familiar with the almost
equally terrible American deserts.</p>

<p>"I vote we go south-west," said Digby. "We're bound
to strike British territory sooner or later and then
we're absolutely safe, and can easily get away by sea.
We're bound to fetch up in Nigeria if we go steadily
south-west. If we could hit the Niger somewhere east of
Timbuktu&mdash;it would lead us straight to it."</p>

<p>"Plenty o' drinkin' water in the Niger, I allow,"
observed Buddy. "But there don't seem ter be no sign-posts
to it. It shore is a backward state, this Sahara...."</p>

<p>"Anyhow it's south-west of us now, and so's Nigeria,"
Digby insisted.</p>

<p>"Starboard yer hellum," observed Hank. "Nigeria on the
port bow&mdash;about one thousand miles."</p>

<p>And that night we did some fifty or sixty of them
without stopping, by way of a good start&mdash;a forced
march while the camels were fresh and strong.</p>

<p>As we padded steadily along, we took stock of our
resources.</p>

<p>With my bottles of water, and the regulation
water-bottles, we had enough for two or three days, with
careful rationing.</p>

<p>Similarly with food. I had a haversack full of bread,
and the other three had each an emergency ration as well as
army biscuits.</p>

<p>Of ammunition we had plenty, and we hoped to shoot
dorcas gazelle, bustard, and hare, if nothing else.</p>

<p>Had Michael been with us, I should have been happy. As
it was, the excitement, the mental and physical activity,
the hopes and fears attendant on our precarious situation
and the companionship of my brother and these two fine
Americans combined to help me to postpone my defeat by the
giants of misery, pain, and grief that were surely only
biding their time, lurking to spring when I could no longer
maintain my defences.</p>

<p>Digby, I think, was in much the same mental condition as
myself, and I wondered if I, too, had aged ten years in a
night.</p>

<p>As we jogged steadily on, the monotony of movement, of
scene, and of sound, sent me to sleep, and every now and
then I only saved myself from falling by a wild clutch at
Hank, behind whom I was sitting.</p>

<p>No one spoke, and it is probable that all of us slept in
brief snatches&mdash; though they must have been very brief
for those who were driving the camels.</p>

<p>I came fully awake as the sun peered over the
far-distant edge of the desert to our left.</p>

<p>I longed for a hot bath and hotter coffee, for I ached
in every nerve and muscle.</p>

<p>"'"<i>They'll have fleet steeds that follow,</i>" quoth young
Lochinvar,'" said Digby.</p>

<p>"They've got 'em," replied Buddy, looking behind as we
topped a ridge of rock.</p>

<p>On we drove, south-west, throughout what was, very
comparatively speaking, the cool of the morning, until
Hank thought we should be making more haste than speed by
continuing without resting the camels.</p>

<p>"I don' perfess ter know much about these doggoned
<i>shammos,</i> as they call 'em," observed Hank, "but I
allow you can't go very far wrong if you treats 'em as
hosses."</p>

<p>"Shore," agreed Buddy, "'cept that they got more control
of their passions like.... Fer eats, and fer settin' up the
drinks, anyhow.... They can live on nawthen. An' as that's
just what we pervided for 'em, they oughta thrive."</p>

<p>"We'll have to find <i>something</i> for them," said Digby,
"if it's only newspaper or the thatch of a nigger's
hut."</p>

<p>"I hev heard of 'em eatin' people's hats at dime shows
and meenageries," said Hank. "My Aunt 'Mandy went to Ole
Man Barnum's show on her golden weddin' day, an' a camel
browsed her hat and all her back hair, an' she never knowed
it until she felt a draught.... Yep. They kin hev our
<i>képis</i> if they wait till we got some Injun shappos an'
pants an' things...."</p>

<p>I was aware that camels had meagre appetites and queer,
limited tastes, embracing a narrow selection ranging from
bran to the twigs of dead thorn-bush, but I agreed with
Digby that we should have to give them something, and
something other than our caps. Our lives depended upon
these two ugly, unfriendly beasts, for without them we
should either be quickly recaptured or else we should die
of thirst and starvation, long before we could reach any
oasis.</p>

<p>In the rapidly narrowing shadow of a providential great
rock in this thirsty land, we lay stretched on our backs,
after an ascetic meal of bread and water.</p>

<p>"What's the programme of sports, Hank?" I asked, as we
settled ourselves to sleep.</p>

<p>"Another forced march ter git outta the onhealthy
location o' Zinderneuf," he replied. "Then we gotta scout
fer Injuns or an oasis. Spread out in a four-mile line an'
peek over every rock and hill.... We'll shore fix it..."
and he went to sleep.</p>

<p>Personally I slept till evening without moving, and I
was only then awakened by the grumbling, gurgling roar
of the camel that Hank was girthing up, one of his feet
pressed against its side and all his weight and strength on
the girth-rope.</p>

<p>Having put the camel-blanket on the other animal, lifted
the wooden framework regulation saddle on to it, girthed it
up, taken the nose-reins over the beast's head and looped
them round the pommel, he bawled "All aboard," and stood
with his foot on the kneeling camel's near fore-knee, while
I climbed into the rear part of the saddle. He then vaulted
into the front seat and the camel, lurching heavily, came
to its feet with an angry hungry roar.</p>

<p>Buddy and Digby mounted the other beast, and once more
we were off, not to stop until we estimated that there were
at least a hundred miles between us and Zinderneuf.</p>

<p>This was, of course, too good to last&mdash;or too bad,
from the camels' point of view. At the end of this second
ride they must have food and a day's rest, if not water.</p>

<p>Again I slept spasmodically, towards morning, especially
after Hank had insisted upon my embracing him round the
body and leaning against him.</p>

<p>I was awakened from a semi-slumbrous state of coma by an
exclamation from Buddy, to realise that it was day again,
the camels were standing still, and their riders gazing at
what Buddy was indicating with outstretched arm.</p>

<p>Over the level stretch of unblown sand which we
were crossing, ran a broad and recent trail of camel
footprints.</p>

<p>This trail crossed ours, though not at right angles. If
we were going south-west I should think the riders were
going south&mdash;or north.</p>

<p>Hank and Buddy brought the camels to their knees, with
the gentle insistent "<i>Oosha, baba, oosha; adar-ya-yan!</i>"
which is about the only order that a camel obeys without
cavil or protest.</p>

<p>Following the footmarks and regarding them carefully,
they decided that there were about twenty camels in the
party, that they were going south, and that they had passed
quite recently.</p>

<p>"What we bin lookin' for!" observed Hank with
grim satisfaction, as he swung himself back into the
saddle. "The nearer we kin git to them Injuns, the
quicker&mdash;but we don' wanta tread on 'em. Keep yer eyes
skinned, boys." And the others having remounted, on we
went.</p>

<p>I should think we followed this trail for three or four
hours, without seeing anything but the eternal desert of
sand and rock.</p>

<p>For some time I had been wondering how much longer we
were to go on without resting the camels, when a grunt of
satisfaction from Hank renewed my waning interest in life.
He brought the camel to a halt and pointed, as Buddy ranged
up beside us.</p>

<p>We had come to the bank of a very wide and rather
shallow dry river-bed, whose shelving sides led down to
gravel and stones which at one time must have been subject
to the action of running water. The place looked as though
a river had flowed along it ten thousand years ago.</p>

<p>But what Hank was pointing to was the spot to which the
footprints led.</p>

<p>Beneath a huge high rock, that rose from the middle of
the river-bed, was a dark inviting shadow around which were
dry-looking tufts of coarse grass, stunted dwarf acacias,
and low thorn-bushes.</p>

<p>The camels were perceptibly eager to get to this
spot.</p>

<p>"Water," said Hank. "May have to dig."</p>

<p>But there was no need to dig. Beneath and around the
rock was a pool, fed presumably from a subterranean source.
It wasn't the sparkling water of an English spring,
bubbling up among green hills, by any means. The green
was rather in the water, but we were not fastidious, and
certainly the camels were not. On the contrary, we were
delighted and deeply thankful.</p>

<p>Here were shade, water, and camel-food, giving us a new
lease of life, and encouragement on our way. It was evident
that a party of travellers had recently halted here.</p>

<p>"Good old Touaregs," said Digby, as we dismounted in the
glorious shade. "Obliging lads. We'll follow them up just
as long as they are going our way home."</p>

<p>"We gotta do more'n foller 'em up," said Hank. "We gotta
<i>catch</i> 'em up. They gotta lend us some correc' desert-wear
striped gents' suitings. Likewise grub-stake us some."</p>

<p>"Shore," agreed Buddy. "An' we ain't no hoss-thieves
neither, but I allow they gotta lend us a couple o' good
camels too."</p>

<p>From the first, the Americans had been anxious to secure
Arab dress, both on account of possible pursuit from
Zinderneuf, and as being less conspicuous and less likely
to bring every wandering Arab band down upon us, directly
they caught sight of us and recognised us for hated
<i>Roumis.</i></p>

<p>They were doubly anxious to procure the disguise on
learning that, in the south, towards Nigeria, there were
numerous forts and outposts of the French Niger Territory,
garrisoned by Senegalese, and that between these posts,
numerous patrols would carefully watch the caravan-routes,
and visit such Arab towns and settlements as existed.</p>

<p>It would certainly be better to encounter a patrol in
the rôle of Arabs than in that of runaway soldiers from the
Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>Accordingly Hank decreed that we must push on, only
enough time being spent here for the camels to eat and
drink their fill. He was of opinion that the party we were
following was an offshoot of the big band that had attacked
Zinderneuf and was on its way to "gather in" some village
which they visited periodically.</p>

<p>Here they would appropriate its harvest of dates or
grain, such camels as might be worthy, those of its sons
and daughters who might be suitable for slaves, and any
goats, clothing, money, and useful odds-and-ends that they
might fancy.</p>

<p>These Touareg bands make an annual tour and visit the
villages of an enormous area, in the spirit of somewhat
arbitrary and undiscriminating tax-collectors. What they
want, by way of tax, is everything the villagers possess
that is portable, including their young men and maidens.</p>

<p>If the villagers are reasonable and relinquish
everything with a good grace, there need not be any
bloodshed&mdash;or very little, just in the way of fun and
sportive merriment.</p>

<p>The Touaregs do not wish to destroy the village and
slaughter the inhabitants, because they prefer to find
a peaceful and prosperous community here, again, next
year.</p>

<p>All they wish to do, is to clean them out absolutely and
leave them alone to amass some more. But if the villagers
choose to be uppish and truculent, giving their visitors
trouble&mdash;they must take the consequences&mdash;which
are fire and sword and torture.</p>

<p>Or, if the band is off its regular beat and not likely
to come that way again, it combines sport with business,
and leaves no living thing behind it, nor any roofed
dwelling in what was a village&mdash;scarcely one stone
upon another of what was a little town.</p>

<p>After about three hours' rest, we pushed on again, and
rode for the remainder of the day and right through the
night. The fact that we did not come up with our quarry
seemed to confirm the theory that they were a war-party on
raiding business. Peaceful caravans and travellers would
never go at such a pace, and we should have overtaken such
a party easily....</p>

<p>On this side of the river, or rather river-bed, the
scenery began to change. The earth grew greyer in colour,
cactus and acacia began to appear, and there were numerous
great rock <i>kopjes.</i> The change was from utterly lifeless
sand-desert to rock-desert, having a sparse vegetation.</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard distant rifle-fire to our
front&mdash;a few scattered shots. Simultaneously, Hank and
Buddy brought the camels to their knees among the rocks,
and we dismounted, unslinging our rifles as we did so.</p>

<p>"Mustn't get the s<i>hammos</i> shot up," said Hank to me.
"You hold 'em, Bo, while we rubber around some," and they
skirmished forward.</p>

<p>Nothing further being heard and nothing seen, they
returned, and we rode on again.</p>

<p>Rounding a great rock, a mile or two further on, a
rock that reminded one of a Dartmoor tor, we saw an ugly
sight.</p>

<p>A woman had been tied to an acacia tree and horribly
mutilated. I need say no more about the sight and its
effect upon us, although I might say a good deal.</p>

<p>It was evident that she had been herding a flock of
goats....</p>

<p>"Village near," said Hank, and he and Buddy again
simultaneously wheeled the camels round, and we retired
behind the tor and dismounted.</p>

<p>"We'll corral the hosses here, and scout some," said
Hank. "It'll be worth dollars to see these darned coyotes
before they see us."</p>

<p>This time the camels were tied with their <i>agals,</i> and
left. We advanced <i>en</i> <i>tirailleur,</i> as though to the
attack of an Arab <i>douar,</i> a man&oelig;uvre with which our
training had made us only too familiar.</p>

<p>Gradually we approached what appeared to be a completely
deserted village by an oasis at the edge of a deep ravine.
I should think there had been a village on this spot
for thousands of years, though the present buildings
were wretched mud huts crowning the basements of ancient
stone houses of great strength. It was as though a tribe
of gipsies, encamped permanently on an Ancient British
hut-circle site on Dartmoor, had used the prehistoric
stones in the construction of their rude dwellings.</p>

<p>Into this village, evidently very recently abandoned, we
made our way with due precaution.</p>

<p>In one of the huts, on a rough <i>angareb,</i> lay a wounded
man. As we entered, he drew a curved dagger from his belt
and feebly struck at us.</p>

<p>"We are friends," said I in Arabic. "Tell us what has
happened. We want to help...."</p>

<p>Digby also aired his Arabic, and the man was
convinced.</p>

<p>He appeared to understand all we said, and I understood
him about as well as an English-speaking Frenchman would
understand a Devonshire yokel.</p>

<p>I gathered that the usual village tragedy had developed
as follows:</p>

<p>A woman, minding goats, had seen a band of Touaregs
approaching (this man called them "The Veiled Ones, the
Forgotten of God"), and had foolishly, or bravely, got up
on a rock and screamed the news to a youth, who was working
nearer the village. They had both then started running, but
the Touaregs had caught the woman. The youth had roused
the village and the men had rushed out with their rifles
to some rocks near by, ready to fire on the Touaregs, and
hoping to give the impression of a large and well-armed
force, fully prepared to give them a warm reception. The
women and children had scuttled to the big ravine behind
the village, down which they would make their way to their
usual hiding-place.</p>

<p>A couple of lads had been sent off to warn the men who
had taken the camels out to graze.</p>

<p>The speaker had been one of these men, and while he and
one or two others were collecting the camels and driving
them to the ravine, a Targui scout had come upon them and
shot him. The rest of the Touaregs had come straight to the
spot, circled round, fired a volley, and closed in on the
camels.</p>

<p>He himself had been left for dead. When he came to
his senses he was alone with the corpses of the other
camel-guards, and he had slowly crawled to his hut to
die.</p>

<p>The Touaregs had camped and were calmly enjoying a
well-earned rest. Apparently the village men were still
watching events from their place among the rocks, the women
and children were in hiding down the ravine, and the camels
were captured.</p>

<p>I gathered that it would have been less calamitous had
the camels been in hiding down the ravine, and the women
and children captured.</p>

<p>We explained the situation to Hank and Buddy.</p>

<p>"Sport without danger, and business with pleasure," was
their view, but we must give the Touaregs the shock of
their lives.</p>

<p>We held a council of war, and it was decided that the
wounded man should get in touch with the villagers and tell
them that we were friends of theirs. More, we were deadly
enemies of the Touaregs, and (most) we'd get the camels
back and give them those of the Touaregs too&mdash;if
they'd play the man and do as we bade them.</p>

<p>Having told his tale and grasped that we really wished
to befriend him, the wounded man seemed to be farther from
death than he had thought. He was shot through the chest,
but I did not think that his lungs had suffered, as there
was no hæmorrhage from the mouth.</p>

<p>After a drink of water and a pill, which Digby gave
him with the assurance that it would do <i>wonders</i> for him
(though I doubted whether they were wonders suitable to
the situation), he got off the <i>angareb</i> and staggered
to the doorway of the hut. From here he peered beneath
his hand for a while, and then tottered out and did some
signalling.</p>

<p>Very pluckily he stuck to it until an answering movement
among the rocks, unseen by us, satisfied him, and he
returned to the hut.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, a hail brought him to the door
again, and this time he walked off fairly steadily, and
disappeared into the ravine.</p>

<p>He returned with a big, dirty squint-eyed Arab, who,
he said, was the headman of the village, which was called
Azzigig (or sounds to that effect).</p>

<p>The headman was in the mental condition of one who sees
men as trees walking, when he found himself in the presence
of four armed and uniformed <i>Roumis,</i> two of whom spoke
Arabic to him, and all of whom wished him to put up a fight
for Azzigig, Home, and Beauty.</p>

<p>His own idea was to thank Allah that things were no
worse, and to lie low until the Touaregs chose to depart,
praying meanwhile that they would do so in peace, without
troubling to hunt out the villagers, burn the houses,
slaughter the goats, and have a little torture-party before
doing so.</p>

<p>When I asked if he felt no particular resentment about
the mutilated woman and the slaughtered camel-guards, to
say nothing of the loss of the entire stock of camels, he
replied that it was doubtless the will of Allah, and who
should dispute that?</p>

<p>When I pointed out that it was obviously the will of
Allah that we should arrive in the nick of time, and that
the Touaregs should camp and rest instead of riding off, he
said he would go and talk with his brethren.</p>

<p>This he did, and returned with a deputation of very
dirty, suspicious, evil-looking Arabs, who evidently did
not believe what he had told them, and had come to see for
themselves.</p>

<p>"Gee!" observed Buddy. "Watta ugly bunch o' low-lifer
hoboes."</p>

<p>"<i>Some</i> stiffs," agreed Hank.</p>

<p>However, I harangued the stiffs, offering them a chance
of recovering their camels and teaching the Touaregs a
lesson. I fumbled for the Arabic for "catching a Tartar"
as I tried to get these fatalists to see they had as much
"right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" as
Touaregs, and that the latter had no God-given privilege to
torture, murder, and rob. As for the "Will of Allah," let
them follow us and show a little pluck, and they'd soon see
what was the will of Allah in the matter.</p>

<p>In support Digby said, "Anyhow, we're going to attack
them, whether you do or not. Those who help us will share
the loot."</p>

<p>As the loot would include excellent rifles and
incomparable camels, this gave the poor wretches something
to think about. In the end, they agreed that if we would
really fight for them, and with them, and give them all the
loot, except a couple of camels, as we had promised, they
would fight their hardest.</p>

<p>We began by reconnoitring the Touareg camp.</p>

<p>Absolutely certain of their complete security, the
robbers had merely lighted fires and lain down to rest,
leaving one of their number to guard their own camels and
two to guard those stolen from the villagers.</p>

<p>Presumably these guards were more herdsmen than
sentries, as the Touaregs had nothing to fear. Villagers
do not attack victorious Hoggar robbers. It simply is not
done. All that was necessary was to prevent the camels
from straying, and to have a rest before proceeding on the
tax-gathering journey&mdash; with or without a little sport
in the village before starting....</p>

<p>Our plan was simple for our job was easy.</p>

<p>Half a dozen selected heroes of Azzigig were to deal
with the somnolent loafing camel-guards&mdash;silently if
possible. Every rifle that Azzigig could boast was then to
be discharged into the Touareg camp, from as close a range
as it was possible to wriggle to.</p>

<p>When the Touaregs bolted to the ravine, as they
certainly would do, to take cover from this blast and
organise their defence&mdash;they would find their way
blocked by the entire French army, in uniform, with a
bugler blowing calls to bring up thousands more!...</p>

<p>I must say that the villagers behaved very well. They
were, of course, born desert fighters, and we had put heart
into them.</p>

<p>After a tremendous volley, at about forty yards' range,
they charged like fiends, and when we four arose from
behind rocks and the Touaregs recoiled in astounded terror,
they surrounded them like a pack of wolves.</p>

<p>In a brief, mad, happy minute of hacking, stabbing, and
shooting, they worked off a good deal of the personal and
ancestral grudge of centuries. As they outnumbered the
Touaregs by five or six to one, had them at a complete
disadvantage, and knew we were behind them, they made a
short job of it and a clean one.</p>

<p>From another point of view it was not a clean one.</p>

<p>At any rate, we prevented torture even if we could not
save life. For once it was the under-dog's turn, and he
used his teeth....</p>

<p>Digby, not unreasonably, claimed that the bugle really
won the battle.</p>

<p>The upshot of the business was that we left Azzigig,
each riding a splendid <i>mehari</i> camel, and each clad in
the complete outfit of a Touareg raider&mdash;newly washed
for us by the grateful dames of the village. Nor could the
lads-of-the-village do enough for us. What they could, and
did, do, was to provide us with a guide and a spare camel
laden with food and water, to help us on our way to the
next village and oasis in the direction of our goal.</p>

<p>A desperate band of ruffians we looked, Touareg to the
last detail of dress, weapons, and accoutrement.</p>

<p>Lean and leathery hawk-faced Hank and Buddy made
splendid Arabs, and seemed to enjoy "playing Injun" like a
pair of boys.</p>

<p>They soon learned the uses and arrangings of the <i>serd</i>
and <i>jubba</i> vests, the <i>kaftan</i> inner coat, the <i>hezaam</i>
sash, the <i>jelabia</i> overall, the <i>sirwal</i> baggy trousers,
the <i>ma-araka</i> skull cap with the <i>kafiya</i> head-dress bound
round with the <i>agals,</i> ropes of camel-hair.</p>

<p>The blue veils which the Touaregs wear, were the chief
trouble, but in time we grew accustomed to them.</p>

<p>I do not know whether these veils are a centuries-old
relic of the days when the Touaregs were a white race
and took care of their complexions; whether they were a
sudden bright idea for keeping the sand from the lungs in
windy weather; whether they were invented for purposes of
mystery and playing bogey with their enemies and victims;
or whether they simply evolved as useful desert-wear for
people always on the move, against cutting sand-filled
winds and a burning glare that smites upward as well as
downward. Anyway, it is curious that only the Touaregs
evolved them.</p>

<p>On our camels we carried <i>zemzimayas</i> full of water, and
<i>jaafas,</i> or leather sacks, which our hosts filled with
<i>hubz,</i> or native bread, and <i>asida,</i> horrible masses of
dough mixed with oil and onions, flavoured with <i>fil-fil,</i>
a sort of red pepper.</p>

<p>On the spare camel were huge <i>khoorgs,</i> or saddle-bags,
filled with <i>alafs</i> of fodder for the camels, as well as
<i>girbas</i> full of water.</p>

<p>We discarded our two military saddles and replaced them
with Arab <i>sergs,</i> and, in fact, "went native" altogether,
retaining nothing European but our rifles and Digby's
bugle.</p>

<p>And in doing this, even, we were not guilty of any
anomaly. I had been interested to note that, along with
heavy swords of Crusader pattern, and lances and knives of
a type unchanged since the days of Abraham, the Touaregs
carried splendid magazine-rifles of the latest pattern.</p>

<p>Both these and their ammunition were of Italian make,
and I wondered whether they had been captured in Tripoli,
or smuggled by the Chambaa rifle-runners of Algeria. As
two men had Turkish rifles and cartridges of ·450 calibre,
I thought it likely that the former was the source. The
useful bugle was, of course, concealed.</p>

<p>Before we departed, the village pulled itself together,
and, evidently trying to show us "what Todgers' could do"
in the way of a <i>diffa,</i> or feast, regaled us upon <i>fatta,</i>
a mess of carrots, bread, and eggs, and a quite decent
<i>cous-cous</i> of goat.</p>

<p>For wassail, the headman brought up from the "cellar"
(under his bed) a magnum (leather) of <i>laghbi,</i> a rare old
vintage palm-juice, which had lain mellowing and maturing
in bottle for quite a week.</p>

<p>I found that my names for things of this sort were not
always the same as the names I had learned in Algeria, but
by any other name they smelled as remarkable.</p>

<p>I asked Hank what he thought of the "liquor."</p>

<p>"Fierce, ain't it?" replied he, and left me to apply
mine own evaluation to the word.</p>

<p>"Guess we could stop here to be the Big Noise of the
tribe," remarked Buddy, endeavouring to feed himself
gracefully with his fingers&mdash;not an easy thing to do
when a spoon is the indicated instrument.</p>

<p>"Yep. Shakers and emus," agreed Hank, with hazy memories
of sheikhs and emirs perhaps.</p>

<p>"And a harem-scarum," added Buddy.</p>

<p>"Why don' the gals jine the hash-party?" he enquired,
looking round to where the women, in their long
<i>barracans,</i> sat afar off and admired the prandial
performances of their lords.</p>

<p>"Shut up. Take no notice of the women-folk," said Digby.
"Sound plan among Mussulmans of any kind."</p>

<p>"No doubt yore right, pard," agreed Buddy, "but there
shore is a real little peach over there jest give me the
glad eye like a Christian gal as knowed a hill o' beans

<p class="poem">"Greater love hath no man than this,<br>
That a man lay down his life for his friends."</p><br>

<p class="first">I COULD fill a large volume with the
account of our adventures, as Touaregs of the Sahara, on
this ride that began at Azzigig, in the French Soudan, and
ended (for some of us) at Kano in Nigeria, in British West
Africa.</p>

<p>It was perhaps the longest and most arduous ride ever
achieved by Europeans in the Sahara&mdash;few of whom have
ever crossed the desert from north to south without an
organised caravan.</p>

<p>We rode south-west when we could, and we rode north-east
when we must, as when, north of Aïr, we were captured by
Touaregs on their way to their own country on the borders
of Morocco.</p>

<p>During one terrible year we made an almost complete
circle, being at one time at El Hilli, within two hundred
miles of Timbuktu, and, at another, at Agadem, within the
same distance of Lake Tchad&mdash;and then later finding
ourselves at Bilma, five hundred miles to the north.</p>

<p>Sometimes thirst and hunger drove us to join
salt-caravans, and sometimes slave-caravans (and we
learnt that slavery is still a very active pursuit and a
flourishing business in Central Africa). Generally these
caravans were going in the direction opposite to ours, but
we had to join them or perish in the waterless desert.</p>

<p>Sometimes we were hunted by gangs larger than our
own; sometimes we were met at villages with volleys of
rifle-fire (being taken, naturally, for what we pretended
to be); sometimes we reached an oasis only to find it
occupied by a patrol of French Senegalese troops&mdash;far
more dangerous to us than the nomadic robbers for whom we
were a match when not hopelessly outnumbered.</p>

<p>Whether we did what no Europeans have ever done before,
I do not know, but we certainly went to places where
Europeans had never been before, and "discovered" desert
cities which were probably prehistoric ruins before a stone
of Damascus was laid.</p>

<p>We encountered no Queens of Atlantis and found no white
races of Greek origin, ruled by ladies of tempestuous
petticoat, to whom it turned out we were distantly
related.</p>

<p>Alas, no. We found only extremely poor, primitive, and
dirty people, with whom we sojourned precisely as long as
untoward circumstance compelled.</p>

<p>Of course, we could never have survived for a single
month of those years, but for the desert-skill, the
courage, resourcefulness, and experience of Hank and
Buddy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the ready wits of Digby, and our
knowledge of Arabic, saved the situation, time after time,
when we were in contact with our fellow-man.</p>

<p>On these occasions we became frightfully holy. Hank and
Buddy were <i>marabouts</i> under a vow of silence, and we were
Senussi on a mysterious errand, travelling from Kufra in
the Libyan desert to Timbuktu, and visiting all sorts of
holy places on the way.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, there were no genuine Senussi about; and
the infinite variety of sects, with their different kinds
of dervishes, and the even greater variety of people who
spoke widely differing dialects of Arabic, made our task
comparatively easy.</p>

<p>Probably our rifles, our poverty, and our obvious
truculence did still more in that direction.</p>

<p>We suffered from fever, terrific heat, poisonous water,
bad and insufficient food, and the hardships of what was
one long campaign of active warfare to live.</p>

<p>At times we were very near the end, when our camels
died, when a long journey ended at a dried-up well, when
we were surrounded by a pack of the human wolves of the
desert, and when we were fairly captured by a <i>harka</i> of
Touaregs, suspicious of our <i>bona fides...</i>.</p>

<p>As I have said, an account of our <i>katabasis</i> would fill
a volume, but the description of a few typical incidents
will suffice to give an idea of it, without rendering the
story as wearisome as was the journey.</p>

<p>For example, our discovery of the place where there
certainly ought to have been "<i>a strange fair people of
a civilisation older, and in some ways higher, than our
own; ruled over by a woman, so incredibly beautiful, so
marvellously</i>..." etc.</p>

<p>One day we rode over the crest of a long ridge of
sand-covered rock&mdash; straight into a band of armed men
who outnumbered us by ten to one, at least, and who were
ready and waiting for us with levelled rifles.</p>

<p>We did as we had done before, on similar exciting
occasions. The Holy Ones, Hank and Buddy, fell dumb, and
Digby became the emissary of the Senussi Mahdi; I, his
lieutenant.</p>

<p>Digby rode forward.</p>

<p>"<i>Salamoune aleikoumi Esseleme, ekhwan</i>" (Peace be unto
you, brothers), said he, in solemn, sonorous greeting, to
which a fine-looking old man replied, to my great relief,
"<i>Aselamu, alaikum, marhaba, marhaba</i>" (Greetings to you
and welcome), in a different-sounding Arabic from ours.
It turned out later that the old gentleman took us for an
advance-party of a big band of Touaregs who were near, and
was only too charmed to find us so charming.</p>

<p>Digby then proceeded with the appropriate account of
ourselves, alluding to the dumb forbidding Hank and Buddy,
as most holy men, <i>khouans, hadjis, marabouts,</i> under a
strict vow of silence that it would be ill work for any
man to attempt to break. Himself and me he described as
<i>m'rabets,</i> men hereditarily holy and prominent in faith
and virtue.</p>

<p>How much of this our hearers understood, and how much of
what they understood, they believed, I could not tell, but
they were obviously relieved to find us friendly and not
part of a larger force.</p>

<p>We were promptly invited to come along, and thought it
best to comply, there being little reason against doing so
and much against refusing. In any case they had "got us,"
from the moment we came upon their levelled rifles, our own
slung behind us; and we were at their mercy. As we rode
along, nominally guests, but feeling we were prisoners, I
was interested to hear Digby assuring the old sheikh that
though we were as holy as it is given to mere men to be, we
were nevertheless good hefty proselytisers who carried the
Q'ran in one hand and the sword in the other, fighting-men
who would be pleased to chip in, if the Touaregs attacked
his band.</p>

<p>The old gentleman returned thanks and said that, once
home, they did not fear all the Touaregs in the Sahara, as
the place was quite impregnable. This sounded attractive,
and proved to be perfectly true.</p>

<p>What did trouble them, was the fact that when they set
off with a caravan of camels for sale at Tanout, it was
more than likely that they would, for months, have to
fight a series of pitched battles or lose the whole of
the wherewithal to purchase grain for their subsistence,
for there was nothing a Touareg robber desired more than
camels.</p>

<p>"It is the only wealth that carries itself," observed
Digby sententiously.</p>

<p>After riding for some three or four hours towards some
low rocky mountains, we reached them and approached a
narrow and lofty pass. This we threaded in single file,
and, coming to the top, saw before us an endless plain out
of which arose a <i>gara,</i> an abrupt and isolated plateau
looking like a gigantic cheese placed in the middle of the
level expanse of desert.</p>

<p>Toward this we rode for another hour or two, and
discovered it to be a precipitous mountain, sheer,
cliff-sided, with a flat top; the whole, I suppose, about a
square mile in area.</p>

<p>Apparently it was quite inaccessible and untrodden by
the foot of man, or even of mountain sheep or goat. Only
an eagle, I imagined, had ever looked upon the top of that
isolated square mile of rock.</p>

<p>I was wrong, however, the place proving to be a gigantic
fort&mdash;a fort of the most perfect kind, but which owed
nothing whatever to the hand of man.</p>

<p>Circling the cliff-like precipitous base of the
mountain, we came to a crack in the thousand-foot wall, a
crack that was invisible at a hundred yards.</p>

<p>Into this narrow fissure the sheikh led us in single
file, and, squeezing our way between gigantic cactus, we
rode along the upward-sloping bottom of a winding chasm
that was not six feet wide.</p>

<p>Suddenly our path was cut by a deep ravine, some three
yards wide, a great crack across the crack in which we were
entombed. Bridging this was laid a number of trunks of the
<i>dom</i> palm, and over these a matting of palm-leaf and sand
made a narrow but safe path for camels.</p>

<p>Obviously this bridge could easily be removed if
necessary, and the place defended with the greatest ease,
if any enemy were foolish enough to attempt to bridge the
abyss while the defenders dropped boulders from terrific
heights, and fired their rifles at point-blank range from
behind the strong stone wall that faced the chasm.</p>

<p>Having crossed the bridge, we rode on upward to
where this narrow slit in the mountain opened out
into a big rock-enclosed square like a landing on a
staircase&mdash;beyond which camels could not go.</p>

<p>In this natural <i>serai</i> we dismounted and left our
beasts, continuing our climb on foot.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, an impregnable place, and I did not see
how the best troops in the world could capture it, so long
as there remained a stout-hearted defender in any one of
the invisible places that commanded the path up which two
men could nowhere climb abreast, and where, in many places,
only one could squeeze with difficulty.</p>

<p>And on the plateau was a walled city, a city built of
blocks of dressed stone, blocks larger than any I have ever
seen put to such purpose, and obviously of such an age in
this use as must have left them old there when the world,
as we know of it, was young.</p>

<p>It was a great and melancholy place, containing, I
should think, at least three times as many dwelling-places
as there were dwellers. Personally, I lost any sense of our
precarious position and all feeling of danger and anxiety,
in interest and wonderment at this "walled city set upon a
hill," and such a hill.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, there was no wonderful white race
here for us to restore to touch with modern civilisation.
Nor was there any wonderful black race either. The
inhabitants of this strange city were just ordinary Arabs,
I believe, though I am no ethnologist, and, so far as they
knew, they had "always" lived there.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I felt perfectly certain that no ancestor
of theirs had placed those incredible monoliths in
position, nor made for themselves doorways twelve and
fifteen feet in height, leading into chambers ten feet
higher.</p>

<p>These people were undoubtedly the long-established
dwellers in this city, but none the less were they dwellers
in someone else's city, and merely camping in it at that,
even if for a few thousand years.</p>

<p>However, they were very interesting people, living
simply and austerely under the benign sway of their
patriarchal sheikh, and quite hospitable and friendly. They
knew but little of the outside world, though they realised
that there were <i>Roumis</i> and infidels of all kinds, other
cities than their own, holy places besides Mecca and
Medina, and greater sheikhs, sultans, and emperors than
their own. They apparently regarded the world, or at any
rate their world, as divided up into Touareg robbers on the
one hand, and the enemies and victims of Touaregs on the
other.</p>

<p>In their marvellous rock fastness they were safe, but
out on the desert they were at the mercy of any nomadic
robber-band stronger than themselves.</p>

<p>Water they had in plenty, as their mountain contained
an apparently inexhaustible well and spring, and they had
goat-flesh and a little grain, vegetables, and dates,
but were compelled to make the six months' caravan
journey to Tanout for the grain that formed the staple
of their food, as well as for ammunition, salt, and
cooking-vessels&mdash;for which commodities they exchanged
their camels as well as dressed goatskins, and garments
beautifully woven and embroidered by their women-folk.</p>

<p>With these good folk we stayed for some days, a pleasant
restful oasis in the weary desert of our lives, receiving
genuine Arab hospitality, and repaying it with such small
gifts as were of more value to them than to us, and by
offering to scout for, and fight with, their caravan then
about to set out across a notoriously dangerous tract of
country to the east.</p>

<p>We must have puzzled the simple souls of this inbred
dying people, for though we were obviously of strict piety,
and observed the same hours of prayer as themselves from
the <i>fedjer</i> at dawn to the <i>asha</i> at night, we would not
pray in company with them, nor, as we sat and <i>faddhled</i>
(or gossiped) round the sheikh's fire at night, would we
say one word on religious subjects. We ran no unnecessary
risks. A dignified "<i>Allahou akbar</i>" or "<i>In châh Allah,</i>"
showed our agreement with the speaker and our pious
orthodoxy, and it had to suffice. As puritanical protestant
reforming Senussi, we had a higher and purer brand of
Islamism than theirs, but refrained from hurting their
feelings by any parade of it....</p>

<p>Digby was great, and his descriptions of Mecca and
Medina, Baghdad, Constantinople, and Cairo, Fez, Timbuktu,
and Kufra, held his hearers spellbound and left them little
time for questions.</p>

<p>Hank and Buddy were equally great, in what they did not
say and the manner in which they did not say it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was well we could make the departure of
the caravan our opportunity for going, and it was well that
our hosts were what they were, and even then the ice, at
times, was very thin.</p>

<p>We descended from this extraordinary and apparently
absolutely unknown prehistoric city, and set off with the
caravan, rested and in better case than we had been in for
months.</p>

<p>We were going in the right direction, we were
approaching Aïr, we should then be near a caravan-route on
which were wells; and if our danger from our fellow-men,
Arab and French, was likely to increase, our danger from
the far more terrible enemy, the desert, would decrease.</p>

<p>With luck, we might parallel the caravan-route and make
dashes for water when opposite the oases on the route,
trusting that we should be able to evade French patrols
(of Senegalese infantry and Arab <i>goumiers)</i> and Touareg
raiding-parties alike.</p>

<p>We said our "<i>Abka ala Kheir</i>" (good-byes) to our late
hosts and heard their "<i>Imshi besselema</i>" (Go in peace)
with real regret, at the last oasis on our common route,
pressed on in good heart and high hopes, did very well
for a month, and then fell straight into the hands of the
rascally and treacherous Tegama, Sultan of Agades, when we
were only four hundred miles from the frontier of Nigeria
and safety.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">Our visit to Agades was a very different
affair from that to the impregnable city on the hill. In
the latter place we felt no real fear and little anxiety.
In Agades we walked very warily, our hearts in our mouths
and our heads loose upon our necks. To the old sheikh we
had been objects of wonder and interest. To the Sultan
Tegama we were objects of the most intense suspicion.</p>

<p>There was nothing of the simple out-of-the-world
dweller-apart, about the swashbuckling ruffians of this
City of the Plain, nor about the arch-ruffian Tegama, their
leader (executed later by the French for treachery), nor
would the pose of pious Senussi emissaries have been of any
avail in these circumstances. In the idiom of Buddy, there
was no moss upon the teeth of the Sultan Tegama and his
gang. In the idiom of Digby there were no flies upon these
gentlemen.</p>

<p>We owed our lives to the fact that we escaped before the
worthy Tegama had quite placed us, and was quite certain
that we were not what we pretended to be&mdash;seditious
mischief-makers from the north, bent upon raising the
desert tribes of the centre and south against the French in
a great pan-Islamic <i>jehad.</i></p>

<p>Not that Tegama had the slightest objection to being
so "raised"; far from it. Nothing would have suited him
better, for there was nothing he enjoyed more; and if to
rapine and slaughter, fire and sword, robbery and massacre,
he could add the heaven-gaining merit of the destruction of
the Unbeliever and the overthrow of his empire in Africa,
the cup of his happiness would be full....</p>

<p>But we puzzled him undoubtedly. Our accent, manners,
habits, ignorance, eyes, complexions, faces, and everything
about us puzzled him.</p>

<p>Certainly we spoke Arabic fluently and knew men and
cities; we seemed to be <i>hadjis</i> all right; we inveighed
with convincing bitterness against the French; we were
upstanding desert fighting-men with nothing whatsoever
European about our clothing and accoutrements; we were too
small a party to be dangerous, and there was no earthly
reason why we should be French spies (for the emissaries
of France came perfectly openly in the shape of extremely
well-equipped military expeditions, pursuing the well-worn
way of all peaceful penetrators, and were a source of fear
and bitter hatred to the Sultan)&mdash; <i>but,</i> we had no
credentials; we gave absolutely no information whatsoever
about the strength, disposition, and movements of the
French forces; we had no cut-and-dried play for an on-fall;
and the dumbness of two of us did not seem to mark them out
as born emissaries of sedition, unrest, and rebellion!</p>

<p>When Tegama voiced these suspicions, Digby, with fine
courage, took the high hand and, as tactfully as possible,
hinted that there might be things in the minds of the
Great Ones, our masters, that were not to be comprehended
by every petty desert chieftain, and that one thing about
their minds was the certainty of a powerful and dangerous
resentment against anybody who hindered the free movements
of their messengers, or behaved as though they were the
friends of the very Infidels from whom these Great Ones
were endeavouring to free Islam....</p>

<p>And the gentle Tegama halted long between two opinions,
whether to impale us out of hand, or whether to put off
till to-morrow what he would like to do to-day, in case we
were what we said we were.</p>

<p>It was an unpleasant time, and though we were not
ill-treated nor imprisoned, our rifles and camels
were "minded" for us, and we never found ourselves
alone&mdash;particularly when we walked abroad, although
it was obvious that no one could escape from Agades on
foot.</p>

<p>We felt that at any moment Tegama might decide that we
were genuine delegates and emissaries from those who were
then so busily stirring the fermenting brew of pan-Islamic
discontent in northern Africa&mdash;and let us go; and also
that at any moment we might so betray ourselves that he
would decide we were impostors&mdash;and forthwith impale
us, living, on the sharpened stump of a young tree....</p>

<p>We had been caught at dawn, in an oasis south west of
the Baguezan mountains, by a <i>harka</i> of Tegama's that had
evidently been raiding and robbing to the north, and, for
a week or so, we rode south as the prisoner-guests of the
emir in command, a magnificent specimen of the best type of
desert Arab.</p>

<p>Him Digby had told the same tale that he had told to the
old sheikh and many another inquisitive wayfarer, but he
had decided to alter his tale for the private ear of the
Sultan as soon as we learnt that it was to so important and
well-informed a person that we were to be taken.</p>

<p>Whispering together at night, we decided that Hank and
Buddy must of course remain dumb, and that we must put up a
terrific bluff of mystery. It would be worse than hopeless
to pretend to be Senussi from Kufra, in a place like
Agades, where it was quite probable there were specimens of
the genuine article, and where our stories would rapidly be
tested and found wanting.</p>

<p>And so we took the high hand with Tegama, so far as we
dared; told him that we had no definite message for him
<i>yet,</i> but that on our return journey he would hear things
that would surprise him, and so forth....</p>

<p>Agades proved to be a very ancient, clay-built,
sand-buried walled town, containing a remarkable mosque
with a tower like a church spire, and although so utterly
lost in the very heart of the Sahara, still in touch with
the outside world by reason of being on the pilgrim-route
to Mecca, and on the great caravan-route that crosses
Africa.</p>

<p>The only other building that was not insignificant was
the Sultan's palace, a big two-storied building of baked
clay, surrounded by a high thick clay wall, the gateway
through which was practically a short tunnel.</p>

<p>Through this tunnel, and past very strong gates made of
palm-trunks nailed solidly together upon cross-pieces, we
were led into a dirty square of desert sand and stones, two
sides of which were formed by mud huts that backed against
the high enclosing wall.</p>

<p>One side of the square was occupied by the palace and
another by a mosque. Camels, goats, chickens, and dirty men
ornamented this palace courtyard or back-yard.</p>

<p>We were invited to enter the palace, and through
another small tunnel came into a big windowless hall, with
unornamented clay walls, clay ceiling, and clay floor.</p>

<p>Here we were kept waiting with our escort, and stood
in haughty silence until conducted across a small inner
courtyard to the presence-chamber of the Sultan of
Agades.</p>

<p>This was another windowless clay room with great arched
ceiling beams and a door, ten feet from the ground, up
to which ran a clay staircase. In the middle of the wall
opposite the door by which we entered, was a throne, also
of clay&mdash;a base material for so exalted a symbol, but
at least it was of honest clay, which its occupant was
not.</p>

<p>Cross-legged on this bed-like throne, in dirty white
robes, sat Tegama, who carried on his face the stamp of
his ruling passions, greed, cruelty, lust, savagery, and
treachery. Around him stood a small group of wazirs,
sheikhs, soldiers, and what I uncomfortably took to be
executioners.</p>

<p>The Sultan glared at us and I felt sorrowful to the tips
of my toes. I knew by now all the ways that such gentlemen
have of putting to death those of whom they do not approve,
and I liked none of them at all. Impaling, a favourite one,
I liked, perhaps, the least....</p>

<p>Digby took the bull by the horns, greeted Tegama
politely, hoped he was well, professed pleasure at seeing
him, and said he had a good deal to say to him later on,
when he had made some arrangements further south and had
taken the political temperature of one or two places in
Damerghou and Damergrim.</p>

<p>Digby took it for granted that we were honoured guests,
and that nothing so silly as the idea of molesting us would
ever occur to so wise and great a ruler as the good Tegama
of Agades.</p>

<p>The good Tegama of Agades continued to eye us coldly.</p>

<p>"And who might <i>you</i> be, with your talk of El Senussi?"
he enquired contemptuously.</p>

<p>"That is for your ear alone," replied Digby. "I have
told the sheikh whom we&mdash;er&mdash;<i>met,</i> in the
Baguezan oasis, such things as are fitting to be told to
underlings. I come from those whose business is not shouted
in every <i>douar</i> and <i>quasr</i> and chattered about to every
wayfarer."</p>

<p>And here I boomed:</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Allah forbid!" and smiled at the idea.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can talk, can you?" sneered Tegama, who had
evidently been told that some of us were dumb.</p>

<p>"<i>Salaam aleikum wa Rahmab Allah,</i>" I intoned
piously. "Our Master in the north&mdash;<i>Rahmat ullahi
Allahim</i>&mdash;(and he may be in Morocco, and he may be in
Algiers, and he may be near here with a mighty army of the
Faithful)&mdash; is not one of whose affairs his messengers
babble, nor is he one whose messengers are delayed."</p>

<p>"And what is his message?" asked Tegama, with, I
thought, less sneer in his voice.</p>

<p>"That comes not here <i>yet,</i>" replied Digby. "The word
comes to the great and good Sultan of Agades later,
when the time is ripe..." and much more of bluff and
mystification that sufficiently impressed Tegama to lead
him to wait and see.</p>

<p>He waited but he did not see, for we escaped&mdash;this
time, I must admit, thanks to Buddy's irrepressible
interest in "squaws."</p>

<p>What he could have achieved had he had the free use
of his tongue I cannot say. In this case, although love
was not only blind, but dumb as well, it contrived to
laugh at locksmiths, and we other three benefited by the
laughter.</p>

<p>We got away and on good camels, but we had not a rifle
among us, nor any other weapon of any sort whatever.</p>

<p>I am tempted to tell, in full, the story of this
evasion, for it was a most romantic business, with all the
accessories of fiction and melodrama. I have said that the
story of this journey alone would fill a large volume,
and it would be small exaggeration to say that a complete
account of our sojourn in Agades would fill another.</p>

<p>I wish I had space in which to tell of the incredible
things we saw in this place, whose atmosphere and ways and
deeds were those of a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>I have read that the first Europeans to set foot in
Agades were the members of the French Military Mission
(which came with the great annual salt-caravan from the
south in 1904), but I could tell of a fair-bearded man who
stared at us with blazing <i>grey</i> eyes, a man whose tongue
had been cut out, whose ears and fingers had been cut off,
and who was employed as a beast of burden.</p>

<p>I could also tell of a Thing that sat always in the Sôk,
mechanically swaying its body to and fro as it crooned. Its
lips, eyelids, ears, hands, and feet had been cut off, it
was blind, and it crooned in <i>German.</i></p>

<p>I could tell of such scenes as that of the last hours
of a very brave man, who was bound face downwards on a
plank that was thrust over the edge of an enormously deep
dry well. At the other end of the plank was a big stone
and a jar of water that slowly leaked, either by reason of
a crack or its porosity. When the water had leaked away
to such an extent that the weight of the jar and stone
was less than that of the man, he and the plank would go
headlong down into the dark depths from which he would
never return.</p>

<p>There he lay staring down into the horrible place, while
round about sat citizens of leisure who told him to hurry
with his last prayers, for the water was nearly gone, while
others bade him to heed them not, for he had hours longer
to wait....</p>

<p>I should like to tell of Tegama's executioners, four
negroes who were the most animal creatures I ever saw in
human form, and not one of whom was less than seven feet in
height. The speciality of their leader was the clean, neat
flicking-off of a head or any required limb, from a finger
to a leg, with one stroke of a great sword; while that of
another was the infliction of the maximum number of wounds
and injuries without causing the death of the victim.</p>

<p>They were skilled labourers and their work was their
hobby....</p>

<p>I could tell of some very remarkable adventures, risks,
dangers, and escapes in Agades, and of some very strange
doings in that horrible "palace" with its plots and
intrigues, jealousies and hatreds, factions and parties, if
space permitted.</p>

<p>And when our time and opportunity came (and we were led
one dark night to where four camels, with water and food
for two or three days, awaited us) we would not have taken
advantage of the chance, being weaponless, had we not felt
that we ran a greater danger by remaining.</p>

<p>Tegama was growing more suspicious and more truculent,
and I rather think that the dumb Hank and Buddy had been
overheard in fluent converse. Probably we gave ourselves
away too (whenever we ate, drank, prayed, sat, stood,
sneezed, or did anything else whatsoever), as the weirdest
kind of weird Mussulmans who ever said, "<i>Bismillah arahman
arahmim....</i>"</p>

<p>It was time to go and we went, aided by a young person
of magnificent physique, magnificent courage, and negroid
ancestry&mdash;probably the daughter of some negro
slave-woman from Lake Tchad....</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was utterly impossible for her to get
us weapons.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">We escaped from Tegama, but not from the
consequences of our encounter with him. He did not destroy
us, but it was to him that we owed our destruction.</p>

<p>Riding as hard as we could, we followed the tactics of
our escape from Zinderneuf, feeling sure that if Tegama
pursued and recaptured us, our fate would be sealed and our
deaths lingering and unpleasant.</p>

<p>We therefore avoided the caravan-route that runs from
Agades, and struck out into the desert, hoping that, as
hitherto, we should, sooner or later, discover someone or
something that would lead us to water.</p>

<p>After three days of painful wandering, we chanced upon
the wretched encampment of some aboriginal Beri-Beri
bushmen, black, almost naked, and armed only with bows and
arrows. They apparently lived by trapping ostriches by
means of tethered foot-traps concealed beneath the bushes
and trees, thorns and acacias, on which the birds feed.</p>

<p>These primitive people were camped beside an
inexplicable pool of water among colossal boulders as big
as cathedrals.</p>

<p>Here we rested ourselves and our camels for a day or
two, and then again set out, with our leather water-skins
filled and our food-bags nearly empty.</p>

<p>A couple of days later we were riding in a long line,
just within sight of each other, and scouting for signs of
human beings or water.</p>

<p>Hank was on the right of the line, I next to him and
half a mile away, having Buddy on my left, with Digby at
the far end.</p>

<p>Looking to my right, I saw Hank, topping a little
undulation, suddenly wheel towards me, urging his camel to
its topmost speed.</p>

<p>As I looked, a crowd of riders swarmed over the skyline,
and, two or three of them, halting their camels, opened
fire on us.</p>

<p>Buddy rode at full speed toward me and Hank. Digby was
cut off from view by a tor of rocks.</p>

<p>"Dismount and form sqar'," yelled Hank, riding up.</p>

<p>I knew what he meant.</p>

<p>We brought our camels to their knees, made a pretence
of getting out rifles from under the saddles, crouched
behind the camels, and levelled our sticks as though they
were guns, across the backs of the animals, and awaited
death.</p>

<p>"This is whar we gits what's comin' to us," said
Buddy.</p>

<p>"The durned galoots may not call our bluff," growled
Hank.</p>

<p>The band, Hoggar or Tebu robbers by the look of them,
bore down upon us with yells of "<i>Ul-ul-ul-ul-ul-ullah
Akbar,</i>" on pleasure and profit bent&mdash; the pleasure of
slaughtering us and the profit of taking our camels&mdash;
brandishing swords, lances, and rifles as they swept
along.</p>

<p>I could have wept that we had no rifles. Steady magazine
fire from three marksmen like ourselves, would have brought
the yelling fiends crashing to earth in such numbers as
might have saved us and provided us with much that we
sorely needed.</p>

<p>The feeling of utter impotence was horrible, and like
the impotence of nightmare.... To be butchered like sheep
without striking a blow.... Could Digby possibly escape?...
Or would they see his tracks and follow him after
slaughtering us?... There was an excellent chance that they
would pass straight on without crossing his trail.... Would
they swerve from our apparently levelled rifles? No. On
they came.... Digby might be well away by now....</p>

<p>And then from somewhere, there rang out loud, clear,
and (to these Arabs) terrible, <i>a bugle-call</i>&mdash;that
portentous bugle-call, menacing and fateful, that had been
almost the last thing so many desert tribesmen had heard,
the bugle-call that announced the closing of the trap and
preluded the hail of bullets against which no Arab charge
could prevail.</p>

<p>The effect was instant and magical. The band swerved to
their right, wheeled, and fled&mdash;fled to avoid what
they thought a terrible trap, so neatly baited and into
which they had so nearly fallen!</p>

<p>As the bugle-calls died away, Hank roared orders in
French at the top of his enormous voice, and away to the
left a man was apparently signalling back with excited
energy, to the French forces behind him, "<i>enemy in
sight.</i>"</p>

<p>Evidently the panic-stricken mob of raiders thought that
the danger was behind the spot on which they had first seen
Hank, for they fled in a direction to the right of the
rocks behind which Digby had blown his bugle....</p>

<p>Suddenly my heart leapt into my throat, as one of
the robbers, perhaps their leader or a candidate for
leadership, swerved to the left from the ruck of the
fleeing band, and, either in a spirit of savage vengeance,
or the desire, not uncommon with these people, for single
combat in the presence of many onlookers, rode at the man
who had exposed himself to signal back to the French force
of which he was evidently the scout....</p>

<p>"Quick!" I shouted. "He'll get him," and I found myself
yelling Digby's name.</p>

<p>We scrambled on to our camels, Hank bawling commands in
French, and Buddy yelling devilish war-whoops.</p>

<p>Digby stooped and then poised himself in the attitude
of a javelin-thrower. As the Arab raised his great sword,
Digby's arm shot forward and the Arab reeled, receiving the
stone full in his face, and jerking the camel's head round
as he did so. Digby sprang at the man's leg and pulled him
down, the two falling together.</p>

<p>They rose simultaneously, the Arab's sword went up,
Digby's fist shot out, and we heard the smack as the man
reeled backwards and fell, his sword dropping from his
hand. Digby seized it and stood over the half-stunned
robber, who was twitching and clawing at the sand....</p>

<p>And then we heard another sound.</p>

<p>A rifle was fired, and Digby swayed and fell.</p>

<p>An Arab had wheeled from the tail of the fleeing band,
fired this shot at thirty yards' range, and fled again, we
three on our galloping camels being not a hundred yards
from him.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Digby was dead before I got to him,
shot through the back of the head with an expanding
bullet....</p>

<p>We tied the Arab's feet, and I blew bugle-calls to the
best of my ability.</p>

<p>I am going to say nothing at all about my feelings.</p>

<p><i>Digby was dead. Michael was dead.</i> I felt that the
essential me was dead too.</p>

<p>I lived on like an automaton, and&mdash;like a creature
sentenced to death&mdash;I waited for the blow to fall, the
moment of collapse to come.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">We buried Digby there, although we
expected the return of the Arabs at any moment.</p>

<p>"He shore gave his life for ourn," said Hank, chewing
his lips.</p>

<p>"'<i>Greater love hath no man,</i>'" I was able to reply.</p>

<p>Buddy said nothing, but Buddy wept. He then untied the
completely-recovered Arab, a huge, powerful young fellow,
twice his size, and without weapons on either side, fought
him and beat him insensible.</p>

<p>Discussing the question of this robber's future, I
suggested we should bind his hands, put him on his camel,
and make him our guide&mdash;bidding him lead us first to
the oasis from which the band had come.</p>

<p>"Lead us not into temptation," said Buddy. "He'd shore
lead us where he wanted us."</p>

<p>Speaking to the man in his own tongue, when he had
recovered from Buddy's handling of him, I asked him what he
was prepared to do to save his life.... Could he lead us
south, parallel with the caravan route, from one oasis or
water-hole to another, if we agreed to set him free as soon
as we were in the Kano territory?</p>

<p>He replied that he would willingly lead us to Hell and
cheerfully abide there himself, so long as he got us there
too. He was undoubtedly a brave man.</p>

<p>I told him that in that case we should take his camel
and weapons (unfortunately for us he had no rifle), and
leave him where he was, to die of thirst.</p>

<p>"<i>El Mektub Mektub</i>" (What is written is written), he
replied, with a shrug, and that was all we could get out of
him.</p>

<p>In the end we took him with us, bound, on his camel,
which was tied to Buddy's, and left him at the first
water-hole to which we came. This we found by following the
track made by his friends as they had come northward.</p>

<p>From here we rode on with filled water-skins and half
the food-supply of the Arab whom we had abandoned....</p>

<p>Digby's death proved to be the first tragic catastrophe
of a series of disasters that now overtook us.</p>

<p>First we encountered a terrible sand-storm that nearly
killed us, and quite obliterated all tracks.</p>

<p>Then we missed the caravan-route when we reluctantly
decided to return to it, either crossing it in ignorance,
where the ground was too rocky for there to be any
footprints, or else riding over the road itself at a spot
where all traces of it had been wiped out, or buried, by
the sand-storm.</p>

<p>Next, nearly dead with thirst, we reached a water-hole,
and found it dried up!</p>

<p>Here our starving camels ate some poisonous shrub or
other, speedily sickened, and within thirty-six hours were
all dead.</p>

<p>We thus found ourselves stranded in the desert, not
knowing whether the caravan-route was to the east or to the
west of us, without rifles, without food, without camels,
and with one goat-skin containing about a pint of water.</p>

<p>This we decided not to drink until we must literally
drink or die, though it seemed that we must surely do that
in any case.</p>

<p>For a day we struggled on, incredibly, without water,
and at the end of the day wondered whether we were a day's
march further from the caravan-road on which were oases,
wells, water-holes, and villages.</p>

<p>Once we found it (if ever), we would risk the
French patrols until we could again get camels. On the
caravan-route, death was probable, here in the desert, on
foot, it was certain.</p>

<p>Night found us unable to speak, our lips black, and
cracked in great fissures, our tongues swollen horribly,
our throats closed, and our mouths <i>dry.</i> (It is an
incredibly horrible thing to have one's mouth literally and
really <i>dry,</i> like hard leather.)</p>

<p>I pointed at the precious water-skin and raised my
eyebrows interrogatively.</p>

<p>Hank shook his head and pointed at the setting sun and
then at the zenith. We must drink to-morrow when we should,
if possible, be in worse case than now.</p>

<p>We reeled on through the night, for our lives depended
on reaching the "road."</p>

<p>Towards morning, I could go no further and sank down
without meaning to do so. I tried to rise and failed.
Seeing that I could do no more, the other two lay down
beside me, and we fell asleep.</p>

<p>The sun woke me to see Buddy, with a face like death,
staring at a scrap of paper torn from a pocket-book.</p>

<p>He passed it to me. On it was scrawled:</p>

<p>"<i>Pards,</i></p>

<p><i>Drink up the water slow and push on quick. Good old
Buddy, we bin good pards.</i></p>

<p align="right"><i>Hank.</i>"</p>

<p>Hank was gone....</p>

<p>Buddy untied the neck of the goat-skin and filled his
mouth with water. He held the water in his mouth for a
minute and then swallowed it slowly.</p>

<p>"Take a mouthful like that and then swaller," he croaked
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"We gotta do what Hank ses," he added, as I shook my
head. I could not drink the water.</p>

<p>"We gotta hike," wheezed Buddy. "We don' wanta make
what he done all for nix. All no good, like. He won't come
back an' drink it.... Yew ain't goin' to <i>waste</i> his life,
pard?... He done it fer <i>you...</i>."</p>

<p>I filled my mouth and swallowed&mdash;but I could not
swallow the lump in my throat....</p>

<p>We staggered on through that day and the next,
moistening our mouths at intervals, and just before sunset,
on the second day, saw a mirage of palm trees, a village, a
little white mosque, and&mdash;the mirage was real.</p>

<p>We stayed at this village for months, scouring the
desert for Hank, working as cultivators, water-carriers,
watchmen, camelmen, and at any other job that offered, and
we were never both asleep at the same time.</p>

<p>When French patrols visited the place, we hid, or fled
into the desert, with the entire sympathy of the villagers.
We could have joined more than one south-bound caravan, but
I would not urge Buddy to leave the place.</p>

<p>He had such faith in the indestructibility of Hank, that
he hoped against hope, until hope deferred made his heart
sick.</p>

<p>At first it was:</p>

<p>"He'll come mushin' in here ter-morrer, a-throwin'
his feet like the Big Buck Hobo, rollin' his tail like a
high-fed hoss, an' grinnin' fit ter bust...."</p>

<p>Then it was:</p>

<p>"Nobody couldn't kill Hank.... He's what you call
ondestructible.... Why, back in Colorado, he shore chased
a man over the Panamint Mountains an' right across Death
Valley once, an' inter the Funeral Mountains t'other side.
A hoss-rustler, he was, and when ole Hank got him, he was
stone dead with heat an' thirst, an' Hank turned right
round an' hiked back and come out alive!..."</p>

<p>And at last, when a caravan came from the north actually
going south to Zinder (the military headquarters of the
<i>Territoire Militaire)</i> and comparative civilisation, he
proposed that we should join it as camelmen and guards.</p>

<p>"You can't stop here fer keeps, pard," he said. "I
reckon I bin selfish. But I couldn't leave ole Hank while
there was a chance...."</p>

<p>But for Michael's letter (and my longing to see Isobel),
I would have urged Buddy to stay, for that was what he
really wanted to do.</p>

<p>Nothing could destroy his faith in his friend's
superiority to the desert and to death. We joined the
caravan as fighting-men, one dumb, and later (as we neared
Zinder) we left it though we had little fear of getting
into trouble there. Still, it was just possible that some
non-com. of the big garrison there might know and recognise
us, and possible that a well-equipped desert-party of
<i>goumiers</i> might have come along the caravan-road from
Zinderneuf.</p>

<p>Our adventures between Zinder and the British border at
Barbera, where we first saw Haussas in the uniform of the
West African Field Force, were numerous, and our hardships
great; but Fate seemed to have done its worst&mdash;and now
that I had lost Digby, and Buddy had lost Hank, and neither
of us cared very much what happened, our luck changed and
all went fairly well.</p>

<p>And one day we rode, on miserable donkeys, into the
great city of Kano, and I revealed myself to an astounded
Englishman as a compatriot.</p>

<p>He was kindness itself, and put me in communication with
a friend, or rather a friend of Aunt Patricia's, a Mr.
Lawrence of the Nigerian Civil Service. This gentleman sent
me money and an invitation to come and stay with him at his
headquarters and to bring Buddy with me.</p>

<p>And when I told Buddy that on the morrow he was actually
going to ride in a train once more&mdash;I found that he
was not.</p>

<p>He had only come to Kano to see me safe, and, having
done so, he was going straight back to look for Hank!</p>

<p>Nothing would shake his determination, and it was waste
of words to try. Nor was it pleasant to strive to persuade
him that his friend was dead.</p>

<p>"Would <i>you</i> go if it was yore brother that was lost,
pard?" he said.</p>

<p>"Nope.... Hank give his life fer us...."</p>

<p>All I could do was to see him fitted out with everything
procurable in Kano&mdash;a fine camel, a spare one for
food, water, ammunition, and a small tent, and a Haussa
ex-soldier as servant and guide, recommended by the Kano
Englishman, an official named Mordaunt.</p>

<p>The latter made it clear to the Haussa that he was to
go north with this American "explorer," obey him in all
things, receive half his pay before starting, and the other
half, with a bonus depending in value upon his merit,
when he returned to Kano with his master, or honourably
discharged.</p>

<p>Mordaunt was good enough to accept my word that if he
would be my banker in this matter, I would adjust things
as soon as I saw Mr. Lawrence, who was an old friend of
his.</p>

<p>I hated parting with the staunch, brave, great-hearted
little Buddy, and I felt that he would never return to Kano
unless it was with Hank, and I had no hope whatever of his
doing that....</p>

<p>I wondered if I should ever have had the cold iron
courage to go voluntarily back into that Hell, after
escaping it by a miracle, on such a ghost of a chance of
finding a friend....</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">I took the train at Kano to some place of
which I have forgotten the name, and Lawrence met me on
the platform. I remembered his face as soon as I saw it,
as that of the quiet, rather dour and repellent man who
had been to Brandon Abbas two or three times when we were
there.</p>

<p>He came nearer to showing excitement, while he listened
to my story, than I thought was his wont. When I had
finished he said:</p>

<p>"I should like to know when fiction was much stranger
than this piece of truth!... And you <i>still</i> do not know
the rights of this 'Blue Water' mystery?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I only know that my brother Michael never
stole anything in his life."</p>

<p>"Quite so," he replied. "Of course.... And now I have
something to tell <i>you.</i> Your Major de Beaujolais was sent
down to Zinder and from there he went home on leave <i>via</i>
Kano&mdash;and on Kano railway-station platform I met him,
and he told me the whole of the story of Zinderneuf Fort
from <i>his</i> side of the business, and about finding your
brother's 'confession.' I went on to Brandon Abbas and told
Lady Brandon what he told me&mdash; and it really did not
seem to interest her enormously!"</p>

<p>It was my turn to feel excited now.</p>

<p>It was incredible to sit there in a hammock-chair
under the African stars, outside this man's tents, a
whiskey-and-soda in my hand and a cheroot in my mouth, and
hear him tell how <i>he</i> had taken our Zinderneuf story to
<i>Brandon Abbas!</i></p>

<p>I think I was soon past wonder and all power to feel
astonishment.</p>

<p>What did strike me and what did give me endless food for
speculation, from then until I saw her, was his account
of how Aunt Patricia had received his incredible news.
Apparently she did not seem even to <i>want</i> to get the
wretched jewel back. Her attitude had puzzled Lawrence, and
it puzzled me as he described it....</p>

<p>When Lawrence had finished his tale he gave me much
Brandon Abbas news.</p>

<p>Sir Hector Brandon was dead. He had died miserably,
alone in Kashmir, of cholera&mdash;his servants and coolies
having fled as soon as the disease was recognised for what
it was.</p>

<p>The Chaplain had died of what was apparently a paralytic
stroke. Claudia had married one of the richest men in
England, nearly old enough to be her grandfather.</p>

<p>Augustus, always a poor horseman, had fallen off his
hunter and been dragged until he was very dead indeed.</p>

<p>Isobel was quite well. No, she had not married. How long
was it since Mr. Lawrence had heard from Lady Brandon? Oh,
quite recently, only a month or so ago. She wrote more
frequently nowadays. Seemed to have no one to turn to for
advice, now the Chaplain was dead....</p>

<p>Isobel was well and unmarried! (I was conscious that
I was breathing more freely and my heart functioning
more regularly than it had done since this grave austere
official had mentioned Claudia's marriage.)...</p>

<p>Did she feel towards me as she had done that morning
when I did not say good-bye to her&mdash;that morning that
seemed so long ago that it might have been in a previous
existence, that morning that <i>was</i> so long ago?</p>

<p>And so Aunt Patricia knew! Yet what did she know after
all? Merely that Michael professed and confessed to be the
single-handed thief of the "Blue Water," and that he, and
he alone, was to blame....</p>

<p>Did she yet know <i>the truth</i> as to the theft?</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">I had been feeling horribly ill for some
time, and now I collapsed altogether with a combination of
malarial fever and dysentery&mdash;that ill-omened union
after whose attack a man is never quite the same again.</p>

<p>Had I been Lawrence's own son, he could not have done
more for me, and the Government doctor, who came post-haste
by rail and horse, was splendid. It was a close call and a
long, slow recovery, but the day came at last when I found
myself weak, shaky, and emaciated on Maidobi platform <i>en
route</i> for Lagos and home.</p>

<p>George Lawrence was with me, having sworn not to let me
out of his sight until he had delivered me safe and sound
at Brandon Abbas. I put aside the unworthy thought which
occurred to me&mdash;that it was himself he yearned to see
safe and sound at that house! The idea occurred to me when
I found that whatever I said about Michael interested him
to the extent that it bore upon Michael's relations to Aunt
Patricia, and that his interest in the mystery of the "Blue
Water" was limited to its bearing upon Aunt Patricia's
affairs.</p>

<p>And so, one day, I found myself on the deck of a
steamer, breathing glorious sea-air, and looking back
upon the receding coast of horrible Africa, and almost
too weak to keep my eyes from watering and my throat from
swelling, as I realised that I was leaving behind me all
that was mortal of two of the best and finest men that ever
lived&mdash;my brothers, Michael and Digby. Also two more
of the finest men of a different kind, Hank and Buddy,
possibly alive, probably dead (for no word had come to
Kano)&mdash;and, but for Isobel, I should have wished that
I were dead too.</p>

<p>But I was glad to be alive, and in my selfishness let
my joy lay balm upon my grief for my brothers and my
friends&mdash;for in my pocket were cables from Isobel,
cables dispatched as soon as Lawrence's letter reached
Brandon Abbas, announcing my appearance in Nigeria, and the
deaths of Michael and Digby.</p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p class="first">I will not write of my meeting with
her. Those who love, or ever have loved, can imagine
something of what I felt as I walked to the Bower, which
she had elected to be our meeting-place rather than a
railway-platform, or a steamer's deck.</p>

<p>There was my darling, more beautiful than ever, and, if
possible, more sweet and loving....</p>

<p>Well, joy does not kill, or I should not have survived
that hour. Aunt Patricia was coldly kind, at first.</p>

<p>I was made to feel that she had sent for me one day, and
I had refused to come, and had further disobeyed her by
leaving the house, against her expressed desires!</p>

<p>After lunch, in the drawing-room, the room from which
the "Blue Water" had disappeared, I gave her, in the
presence of Isobel and George Lawrence, the letter and
packet that had been Michael's charge to me.</p>

<p>She opened the letter first and read it, and then read
aloud in a clear and steady voice:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"<i>My most dear and admired Aunt Patricia,</i></p>

<p class="letter">
"When you get this, I shall be dead, and when you
have read it I shall be forgiven, I hope, for I did what
I thought was best, and what would, in a small measure,
repay you for some of your great goodness to me and my
brothers.</p>

<p class="letter">
"My dear Aunt, I knew you had sold the 'Blue Water'
to the Maharajah (for the benefit of the tenants and the
estate), and I knew you must dread the return of Sir
Hector, and his discovery of the fact, sooner or later.</p>

<p class="letter">
"I was inside one of the suits of armour when you
handed the 'Blue Water' over to the vizier or agent of the
Maharajah. I heard everything, and when once you had said
what you said and I had heard it&mdash;it was pointless
for me to confess that I knew&mdash;but when I found that
you had had a duplicate made, I thought what a splendid
thing it would be if only we had a burglary and the 'Blue
Water' substitute were stolen! The thieves would be nicely
done in the eye, and your sale of the stone would never be
discovered by Sir Hector.</p>

<p class="letter">
"Had I known how to get into the Priests' Hole and open
the safe, I would have burgled it for you.</p>

<p class="letter">
"Then Sir Hector's letter came, announcing his return,
and I knew that things were desperate and the matter
urgent. So I spirited away that clever piece of glass or
quartz or whatever it is, and I herewith return it (with
apologies). I nearly put it back after all, the same night,
but I'm glad I didn't. (Tell John this.)</p>

<p class="letter">
"Now I do beg and pray you to let Sir Hector go on
thinking that I am a common thief and stole the 'Blue
Water'&mdash;or all this bother that everybody has had will
be all for nothing, and I shall have failed to shield you
from trouble and annoyance.</p>

<p class="letter">
"If it is not impertinent, may I say that I think you
were absolutely right to sell it, and that the value is a
jolly sight better applied to the health and happiness of
the tenants and villagers and to the productiveness of the
farms, than locked up in a safe in the form of a shining
stone that is of no earthly benefit to anyone.</p>

<p class="letter">
"It nearly made me regret what I had done, when those
asses, Digby and John, had the cheek to bolt too. Honestly,
it never occurred to me that they would do anything so
silly. But I suppose it is selfish of me to want all the
blame and all the fun and pleasure of doing a little job
for you.</p>

<p class="letter">
"I do so hope that all has gone well and turned out as I
planned. I bet Uncle Hector was sick!</p>

<p class="letter">
"Well, my dear Aunt, I can only pray that I have helped
you a little.</p>

<p class="letter">
"With sincerest gratitude for all you have done for us,</p>

<p class="letter">"Your loving and admiring nephew,</p>

<p class="letter">"'Beau' Geste."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"A <i>beau geste,</i> indeed," said Aunt
Patricia, and for the only time in my life, I saw her put
her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Extract from a letter from George
Lawrence, Esq., C.M.G. of His Majesty's Nigerian Civil
Service, to Colonel Henri de Beaujolais, Colonel of Spahis,
XIXth (African) Army Corps:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"... And so that is the other side of
the story, my friend. Alas, for those two splendid boys,
Michael and Digby Geste....</p>

<p class="letter">
"And the remaining piece of news is that I do most
sincerely hope that you will be able to come over to
England in June.</p>

<p class="letter">
"You are the best man I know, Jolly, and I want you
to be my Best Man, a desire heartily shared by Lady
Brandon.</p>

<p class="letter">"Fancy, old cabbage, after more than thirty years of devotion!... I feel like a boy!</p>

<p class="letter">
"And that fine boy, John, is going to marry the 'so
beautiful child' whom you remembered. Lady Brandon is being
a fairy godmother to them, indeed. I think she feels she is
somehow doing something for Michael by smoothing their path
so...."</p>
